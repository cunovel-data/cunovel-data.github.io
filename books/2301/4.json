I reminded myself that he hadn\u0027t killed the woman in question. Of course, that didn\u0027t mean he hadn\u0027t killed others. I would be wise to remember that.\\n\\n Clearing my throat, I said, “Go on.”\\n\\n “Are you sure you want to hear this?” e asked somewhat dubiously.\\n\\n “Yes, it\u0027s fascinating.” And it was, in much the same way any gruesome accident catches and holds our attention.\\n\\n “Since we could no longer go to school, our parents hired a tutor for us. As long as we lived at home, my mother treated us as though we were no different than we had been before the change.” He smiled faintly. “It was a unique experience. We slept by day and met with our tutor in the evening. Because our class held its graduation ceremony after sunset, Rane and I were able to attend. We moved out of our parents\u0027 home the next day.”\\n\\n “Just a happy Vampire family,” I murmured, intrigued by the story he had told me. I tried to imagine being married to a Vampire, having Vampire children, but it was a concept totally foreign to my way of thinking, to everything I believed in. Try as I might, I couldn\u0027t wrap my mind around it. And then I frowned. “What happened to your mother?” I supposed there was a slim chance she could still be alive, but if he was eighty-five, she would have to be well over a hundred.\\n\\n “She\u0027s one of us now,” Raphael said. “My father brought her across when Rane and I reached adulthood.”\\n\\n “Did she want to be a Vampire?” I had never heard of anyone asking to join the ranks of the Undead.\\n\\n “Of course. My old man wouldn\u0027t have turned her against her will.”\\n\\n “Was she the same, you know, afterward?”\\n\\n “Pretty much.”\\n\\n “And she was never sorry?”\\n\\n “Not that I know of. And you have to remember, her parents, her husband, and her sons were all Vampires. We made the transition easy for her.”\\n\\n “Did you watch it happen?”\\n\\n “No, although I wanted to.”\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t imagine why anyone would want to see such a thing, all that blood. Yuck!\\n\\n “It\u0027s not such a bad life once you get used to it,” he said quietly.\\n\\n “Yeah, right.” Drinking blood, living only at night, giving up all my favorite foods, not being able to enjoy a sunny day or take a walk in the rain on a pretty spring morning. I was surprised the whole world wasn\u0027t clamoring to join the ranks of the Undead. Not!\\n\\n “Sure, you have to give up some things,” he admitted, “but I\u0027m never sick, never tired, I don\u0027t age, all my senses are enhanced. And,” he said with a grin, “I don\u0027t gain weight.”\\n\\n It would have been a good selling point if Vampires could eat anything they wanted. “Vampires don\u0027t eat,” I muttered, trying to imagine a life without chocolate or cookies or ice cream. “Of course they don\u0027t gain weight.”\\n\\n Rafe laughed. “True enough, but, like I said, it\u0027s not a bad life.”\\n\\n Technically, he wasn\u0027t alive at all, but I didn\u0027t say that. “And now you\u0027re the leader of the North American Vampires,” I remarked. “How did that happen?”\\n\\n He shrugged. “My godmother arranged it.”\\n\\n “You have a godmother?” I wouldn\u0027t have been any more surprised if he had told me that he was related to Cinderella.\\n\\n “Yes.” He grinned, no doubt amused by the stunned expression that was surely on my face. “Her name is Mara, and she\u0027s the oldest living of our kind. When we went to war with the Werewolves, our people decided we needed a leader. She was the obvious choice. She appointed others to positions of authority in various parts of the world. I was given North America, and my parents were given South America. My grandparents are looking after things in Europe. Last I heard, they were in France.”\\n\\n “What happened to your brother? Do you see him very often?”\\n\\n A dark shadow passed behind Cordova\u0027s eyes. “I don\u0027t know where he is.”\\n\\n I heard the knife-edge of pain in his voice, a soul-deep sorrow that went beyond tears.\\n\\n “No one in the family has seen Rane, or heard from him, in the last fifty years.”\\n\\n “What happened? Did you have a fight?”\\n\\n “No, nothing like that. Not all who are made Vampires react the same way. Some seek it and embrace it. Some are turned against their will. Some accept the change and move on. Some can\u0027t adapt to their new lifestyle and quickly end it.”\\n\\n I held my breath. Was Rane one of those?\\n\\n “For me, it was a natural transformation,” Raphael said. “For Rane…” The pain in his eyes deepened. “At first, it seemed as though Rane had accepted it as I did. He was gifted with all the powers I had, and more.”\\n\\n “What do you mean ‘more\u0027?”\\n\\n “He has a knack for magic, as well. It\u0027s a potent combination.”\\n\\n “I can imagine.”\\n\\n “Oddly enough, my maternal grandmother is also a practicing witch.”\\n\\n “So he inherited it from her?”\\n\\n “No, our mother was adopted.”\\n\\n “Your family is certainly unique.”\\n\\n Rafe nodded. “Indeed.”\\n\\n “And your brother, he doesn\u0027t want to be a witch or a Vampire?”\\n\\n “So it seems. All his life, he\u0027s been torn between light and dark, between good and evil. Becoming a Vampire was more than he could handle. He ran away from us, and from himself. I looked for him. The family looked for him, but he\u0027s closed his heart and his mind to us. I don\u0027t know how he is, or where he is. All I know is that he\u0027s alive.” Rafe stared past me, his expression bleak. “I\u0027d know if he were dead.”\\n\\n I had read somewhere that Vampires were incapable of tender human emotions, but whoever had written such a thing would surely have changed his mind if he could have seen the anguish on Rafe\u0027s face, the hurt in his eyes, or heard the pain in his voice.\\n\\n I stared at him, wishing I could help, and thinking that I had learned more about Raphael Cordova and Vampires than I had ever wanted to know.\\n\\n Chapter Four\\n\\n Raphael was right about the filet mignon. It was the best I had ever tasted, rare and tender and seasoned to perfection. I have to admit, I felt a little strange enjoying a full-course meal in front of a Vampire. When I offered him a bite of my steak, he made the kind of face I would have made had he offered me a glass of warm blood.\\n\\n “Don\u0027t you ever eat anything?” I asked. I couldn\u0027t imagine never drinking a glass of ice-cold lemonade on a hot day, never eating a double scoop of fudge-ripple ice cream, never biting into a cold, tart green apple, or a juicy slice of watermelon. And the thought of never again indulging in a brownie still warm from the oven didn\u0027t even bear thinking about. “Don\u0027t you miss it? Food, I mean.”\\n\\n He looked at the steak on my plate. It was medium rare, the inside a deep rosy pink, just the way I liked it.\\n\\n “Sometimes,” he admitted, “but not often.” Lifting his glass, he took a drink.\\n\\n I wondered again if it was really wine. I told myself it had to be. I mean, he had obviously planned to share it with me until I ordered something else. Still, when I wasn\u0027t looking, he could have signaled the waitress to bring him something more to his taste. I spent a moment debating whether to ask him, and then decided I didn\u0027t really want to know.\\n\\n The waitress arrived to clear our dishes. She asked Raphael if she could bring him anything else.\\n\\n He looked at me. “Kathy?”\\n\\n “Nothing more for me, thanks, I\u0027m full.”\\n\\n With a slight nod at me and a smile for Rafe, the waitress gathered my dishes and moved away from the table.\\n\\n I shifted in my seat. I was all too aware of the silence, of the man beside me, and of the way his thigh was pressed intimately against my own. His scent tickled my nostrils. It wasn\u0027t cologne, it wasn\u0027t soap. I don\u0027t know what it was, just the scent of the man himself, I guess.\\n\\n “Kathy?”\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “Would you like to go for a drive?”\\n\\n I cleared a throat gone suddenly dry. Every instinct I possessed screamed that going for a drive with a man whose scent was more intoxicating than a shot of whiskey straight up was a very bad idea. So naturally I said yes.\\n\\n Moments later we were flying down the highway at a hundred miles an hour. It was a first for me, and I have to admit that it was exhilarating until I let myself think about what would happen if the car skidded out of control and wrapped itself around a tree. It probably wouldn\u0027t hurt Raphael much, at least not permanently. I would most likely end up dead.\\n\\n Before I could ask him to slow down, he eased off the gas and turned on the radio. Kenny G\u0027s “Songbird” filled the air, though I didn\u0027t pay much attention. I was too busy watching the speedometer. I didn\u0027t relax until we were doing a nice, reasonably safe sixty.\\n\\n Raphael flashed a grin in my direction. “Sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to scare you. Going a hundred miles an hour with my hair on fire has always been my way of letting off steam.”\\n\\n “Really? What are you steamed up about?”\\n\\n “You.”\\n\\n “Me?” The word emerged from my throat as little more than a squeak.\\n\\n With a nod, he pulled off the road and put the car in Park. “You.” His dark eyes glowed when he looked at me. “I\u0027ve wanted you since the first night I saw you.”\\n\\n Mindful that a Vampire could mesmerize a human with little more than a glance, I was careful not to meet his gaze.\\n\\n “Admit it,” he said, and there was a rough edge to his voice. “You feel the same about me.”\\n\\n I started to deny it, but the words died, unspoken, as I recalled the image I\u0027d had of the two of us lying entwined in each other\u0027s arms. I wasn\u0027t about to admit it, though, especially not here and now.\\n\\n “Kathy, look at me.”\\n\\n “No way.”\\n\\n “Still afraid of me?”\\n\\n “Darn right! I know all about Vampires….” That was a lie. All I really knew for sure was that they drank blood, slept in coffins, and that the sun turned them to ash in the blink of an eye. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-4.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) \\n Passion Has a Darker Side... \\n Kathy McKenna was sure that the little Midwestern town of Oak Hollow would be isolated enough for safety, but the moment the black-clad stranger walked into her bookstore, she knew she was wrong.
