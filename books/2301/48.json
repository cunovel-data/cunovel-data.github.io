Edna tossed me a pillow and a blanket and told me to make myself comfortable. Before she closed the door, I overheard Pearl say something about rounding up another group for more tests as soon as they dispatched the last of the previous subjects.\\n\\n Dispatched. The word had a nasty ring of finality to it.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know where Rafe had gone, but I was glad he hadn\u0027t been there when Edna and Pearl and their henchmen arrived. Although he could be active during the day, I didn\u0027t know how strong his powers were when the sun was up, or if he could have taken on Edna and Pearl and five men at the same time.\\n\\n I blew out a sigh and closed my eyes. I was getting awfully tired of being used as bait. I just hoped Rafe wasn\u0027t foolish enough to try to rescue me again, because if they got him in here with me, I didn\u0027t know how we would ever get out.\\n\\n Chapter Thirty-Four\\n\\n Rafe stood in the doorway of the motel room, his hands clenched at his sides. He had known before he opened the door that Kathy was gone, just as he had known that Edna and Pearl had been there. He caught the scents of five men, two that he recognized from the lab.\\n\\n He swore softly, thinking he had been a fool not to end this sooner. He had intended to settle things with Edna and Pearl the night before, but then he had heard Kathy\u0027s voice in his mind. Her unhappiness had been more than he could bear. That, coupled with his own need to see her, to hold her, to make sure she was out of danger, had sent him to the motel in River\u0027s Edge. He should have gone back to Oak Hollow as soon as he knew Kathy was all right. Instead, he had spent the night making love to her, and now, because of him, her life was in danger again.\\n\\n It took only minutes to follow her scent to the deserted meat-packing plant on Oak Tree Road. Muttering an oath, he paced the shadows, then dissolved into mist and slid under the door. He sensed Kathy\u0027s presence immediately.\\n\\n Hovering near the ceiling, he saw Edna and Pearl sitting at one end of a long table, several notebooks and folders spread out in front of them. At the other end of the table, six men were playing poker. A number of rifles, handguns, and wooden stakes were piled on a smaller table, along with several glass bottles that Rafe assumed held holy water.\\n\\n “I still don\u0027t know what they did to Travis,” Pearl was saying. “But they\u0027re going to pay for it. He was the best hunter in the business!”\\n\\n “Except for you and me,” Edna remarked.\\n\\n Pearl smiled fleetingly, then slammed her fist on the table. “I can\u0027t wait to get my hands on Cordova! I\u0027m sure he\u0027s behind this. All our records in Texas have been destroyed, and all our files at the lab. Damned Vampire, sticking his nose in places where it doesn\u0027t belong! Well, he won\u0027t get away this time. As soon as we take care of him, we\u0027ll find Cagin and the McGee woman, and that\u0027ll be the end of it.”\\n\\n “Almost seems a shame to destroy Cordova,” Edna said. “Such a good-looking man.”\\n\\n “Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake, Edna Mae Turner, you\u0027re just saying that because you think he has a cute butt!”\\n\\n Had he been in corporeal form, Rafe would have laughed out loud. Cute butt, indeed!\\n\\n “It\u0027s a good thing I had the formula in my head,” Pearl muttered. “It made it a lot easier to concoct the new one. You know, instead of destroying Cordova, maybe we should just try the new formula on him and the girl.”\\n\\n “Whatever you want,” Edna said agreeably, “but I still think you should write the new formula down.”\\n\\n “Maybe later.”\\n\\n “Do you think whatever Vampire whammy Cordova put on Travis is permanent?”\\n\\n “I don\u0027t know. Did you see how he acted last night? One mention of the word Vampire and he practically went into hysterics.”\\n\\n Pleased with what he had heard, Rafe left the building and assumed his own form, then reached for his cell phone. All the rats were in one trap. All he needed now was a little backup.\\n\\n Susie ran her hands over her face, then glanced at Cagin. “Does it look as bad as it feels?”\\n\\n Joe shook his head. “No, it looks a lot better.” He ran his finger down her cheek. “There\u0027s only a small red place here.”\\n\\n “What about the other side?”\\n\\n “It\u0027s healing.”\\n\\n Susie sank back on the sofa. She had planned to get her children and leave town, but she couldn\u0027t let them see her like this. Instead, she had convinced her mother to take the boys on a little vacation for a few days. She hated for her sons to miss school, but it couldn\u0027t be helped. With a sigh, she rested her head on the back of the sofa. Sometimes she felt like she was living a nightmare from which there was no escape. She didn\u0027t know what she would have done without Joe. He was her only comfort these days.\\n\\n When her cell phone rang, she picked it up, expecting it to be her mother or Kathy.\\n\\n Instead, she heard Rafe\u0027s voice on the line.\\n\\n “Susie, is Cagin there?”\\n\\n Rafe stepped out of the shadows when Cagin and Susie arrived. “Thanks for coming.”\\n\\n “Wouldn\u0027t miss it,” Cagin said with a grin.\\n\\n “Is Kathy all right?” Susie asked.\\n\\n “Other than being cold and scared, she\u0027s fine.”\\n\\n “So, how do you want to handle this?” Cagin asked.\\n\\n “Like I told you, there are six men in there with Edna and Pearl. Lots of hardware.” Rafe glanced at Susie. “And holy water. I figure the best way to play it is to go in hard and fast. We should be able to break down the door and take out the men before they know what\u0027s happening. Once the men are out of the way, we\u0027ll take the women. Cagin, you\u0027ll have to dump the holy water.”\\n\\n Cagin nodded. “No problem.”\\n\\n Rafe looked at Susie. “You up for this?”\\n\\n She lifted a hand to her face. “Are you kidding? After what they did? Just try and keep me out. Besides, Kathy\u0027s in there, and good friends are hard to find.”\\n\\n Rafe winked at her. “Let\u0027s do it.”\\n\\n It went like clockwork. Cagin undressed and then shifted, Rafe kicked in the door, and the Were-tiger sprang inside, with Rafe and Susie right behind him.\\n\\n The people inside the building looked up as the door flew open, the surprise on their faces quickly turning to fear. Edna and Pearl scrambled away from the table, apparently trusting that the men would protect them, but the men were too slow. By the time they reached for the guns on the table, it was too late, although one of them managed to fire a round that struck Cagin in the thigh. With a growl, Cagin sprang across the table. Three of the men went down amid a flurry of growls, teeth, and claws; Rafe dispatched two of the men, leaving Susie to deal with the last one. It was swift and brutal and over in a matter of minutes.\\n\\n Shifting back into his own form, Cagin grabbed the bottles and dumped the holy water outside while Susie and Rafe backed Edna and Pearl into a corner.\\n\\n When Cagin returned, Rafe noted that he had taken the time to get dressed again.\\n\\n “Now what?” Cagin asked, glancing from Rafe to the two women.\\n\\n “Keep an eye on these two while I get Kathy,” Rafe said, “and then we\u0027ll decide what to do next.”\\n\\n Chapter Thirty-Five\\n\\n I was pacing the floor, my mind in turmoil, when the door swung open. At first, all I saw was a dark silhouette that looked familiar.\\n\\n “Rafe? Rafe!” I flew into his arms, thinking I had never been so surprised or so happy to see anyone in my life.\\n\\n “Rescue party\u0027s here,” Rafe said, giving me a hug.\\n\\n “How did you find me?”\\n\\n His gaze moved over my face. “I\u0027ll always be able to find you. Are you all right?”\\n\\n “I\u0027m fine, now. Are you all right? How\u0027d you get in here. Where are Edna and…”\\n\\n He silenced my questions by kissing me. When I came up for air, I saw that we weren\u0027t alone.\\n\\n Susie and Cagin had Edna and Pearl trapped in the far corner of the room. For the first time since I had met them, Edna and Pearl looked subdued, their faces pale. Moving deeper into the room, I stared at the six bodies sprawled on the floor at one end of a long table. The scent of blood and death made my stomach churn. The bitter taste of bile rose in the back of my throat.\\n\\n I looked up at Rafe. There was no remorse in his eyes when he looked at me. I could only hope it had been self-defense.\\n\\n “Let\u0027s get this over with,” Cagin said.\\n\\n I followed Rafe across the room, my stomach churning with apprehension. “What are you going to do with them?” I asked, though I was dreading the answer.\\n\\n “What do you think?” Cagin asked, a growl in his voice.\\n\\n “But…” I looked up at Rafe. “Are you just going to kill them in cold blood?”\\n\\n His gaze met mine. “Don\u0027t you think they deserve it?”\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to say. Edna and Pearl had killed innocent people. True, some of the ones they had killed hadn\u0027t been people in the true sense of the word, but they had taken innocent lives. I remembered the fear and humiliation I had felt while I waited in that awful cage, the horror that engulfed me when they injected me with their formula, the pain that had wracked my body. I could have been killed. We all could have been killed.\\n\\n I looked at Edna and Pearl. You had to admire their courage. They were both glaring at Rafe, as though daring him to do his worst.\\n\\n “Kathy?” I felt the weight of Rafe\u0027s gaze as he waited for my answer.\\n\\n “I don\u0027t know.” Maybe they deserved it, maybe not. Who was I to make such a decision?\\n\\n “Well, I know!” Cagin said. “Look at Susie\u0027s face!” His power filled the room, and I knew he was eager to shift into the tiger and rip out their throats.\\n\\n “Wait.” Rafe\u0027s voice, soft as dandelion fluff, stopped Cagin in his tracks. “I have a better idea.”\\n\\n “Better than killing them?” Cagin asked. “I don\u0027t think so.”\\n\\n “Call it poetic justice,” Rafe said.\\n\\n Taking a step forward, he reached for Edna\u0027s hand. Lips compressed in a thin line, she recoiled from his touch. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-48.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) \\n Passion Has a Darker Side... \\n Kathy McKenna was sure that the little Midwestern town of Oak Hollow would be isolated enough for safety, but the moment the black-clad stranger walked into her bookstore, she knew she was wrong.
