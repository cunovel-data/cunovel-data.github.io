Is it really like death?”\n “I wouldn\u0027t know,” he said with a wry grin. “Since I\u0027ve never died. All I know is that it\u0027s different from mortal sleep.”\n “Different how?”\n “Sleeping Vampires, except for the old ones, are helpless during the day, and they don\u0027t dream.”\n “So, what\u0027s it like for you?” I slid my hand over his biceps, admiring the latent strength beneath my palm. “If I touch you while you\u0027re sleeping, will you feel it?”\n “Yes.”\n “And if I call your name, will you hear me?”\n “I will always hear you.”\n I smiled at that. “Do you dream?”\n His heavy-lidded gaze held mine. “Sometimes.”\n “What do Vampires dream about?” I ran my hand down his arm and over his abs.\n “If you don\u0027t stop that,” he said, his voice husky. “I\u0027ll show you what I dream about.”\n Warmth spread through me. If he hadn\u0027t been on the brink of oblivion, I would have made those dreams come true. As it was, I kissed him lightly. “Will it disturb you if I take a shower?”\n “No.” He smiled faintly. “Next time, perhaps I\u0027ll share it with you.”\n “I\u0027d like that.” The image of the two of us, soapy from head to foot, stirred something deep within me. I kissed him again, then went into the bathroom and closed the door.\n For a moment, I stood there, my fingertips pressed to my lips as I remembered all that had happened between us the night before.\n Smiling, I took a quick shower. Later, while drying off, I wished I had some clean clothes and a change of underwear. I wasn\u0027t happy with the thought of putting on my dirty clothes. I never wanted to wear them again. I pulled on a pair of Rafe\u0027s sweatpants and one of his T-shirts. Both were too big, of course, but they were clean, and they smelled of the man I loved.\n I tiptoed out of the bedroom and went into the living room where I found Cagin sitting on the sofa, his hands dangling between his knees.\n He lifted one brow when he saw me.\n “What?” I said.\n “You slept with him.” There was no censure in his voice; it was simply a statement of fact. “I wondered how long it would take.”\n He could have meant I slept beside Rafe during the night, but that wasn\u0027t what he meant and we both knew it. I felt my cheeks grow hot. I started to deny it when he lifted his hand.\n “I can smell it on you,” Cagin said.\n I lifted my chin and squared my shoulders. “It\u0027s none of your business.”\n He shrugged.\n “I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any food in the house,” I remarked.\n “There\u0027s coffee, orange juice, and donuts in the kitchen.”\n “Oh?”\n “I went out early this morning.”\n “Do you think that was wise?”\n Cagin made a dismissive gesture with his hand. “We\u0027ve got to eat. The coffee\u0027s cold, but you can nuke it in the microwave.”\n “Thanks.” Coffee and donuts weren\u0027t the most nutritious meal, but this morning they suited me just fine.\n Going into the kitchen, I glanced around while I heated the coffee, thinking that the room was going to waste with nothing in it but a small refrigerator to keep an occasional bag of blood fresh and a microwave to warm it in. The thought made my stomach churn. I\u0027d have to get used to his ways, I thought, and he\u0027d have to get used to mine, which included buying a stove and a larger refrigerator, as well as a table and chairs.\n I took the cup from the microwave, wishing that Cagin had thought to pick up a few packets of sugar. Plucking a buttermilk donut from the box on the counter, I returned to the living room.\n “How\u0027s Susie?” Plopping down in one of the chairs, I set my cup on the coffee table, then took a bite of the donut.\n A sigh rose from deep inside Cagin\u0027s chest. “Sleeping peacefully now.”\n “Was it…terrible? Watching her change?”\n “Terrible?” The word seemed torn from his throat. “Terrible? Yeah, it was terrible. Damn near broke my heart to watch her.”\n “But she\u0027s all right?” I took a sip of the coffee. It was black and strong and bitter. I drank it anyway.\n He nodded. “I owe Cordova a debt I can never repay.”\n “And she\u0027s all right with being a Vampire now?”\n “She said she was glad to be alive, but she\u0027s worried about her kids.”\n That was understandable. She would have to find someone to look after them during the day now, someone to take them to school and pick them up, drive them to the dentist and Little League. How would she explain her sudden aversion to light, the fact that she didn\u0027t eat, or sleep at night?\n “Tell me about you.” I put the empty cup aside. “What\u0027s it like to be a shape-shifter? Do you like it?”\n “What\u0027s it like to be human?” he asked. “Do you like it?”\n “Touché.”\n “It\u0027s what I am, what I\u0027ve always been. A leopard can\u0027t change his spots,” he said, grinning, “or, in my case, his stripes.”\n “It\u0027s different than being a Werewolf, though, isn\u0027t it? I mean, you don\u0027t run around killing people, do you?”\n He shrugged. “It\u0027s been known to happen, on occasion.”\n I had a sudden mental image of Rick McGee lying on the floor in a deserted house.\n “So, how serious is it with you and the Vampire?”\n “I don\u0027t know what you think of me,” I said sharply, “but I don\u0027t sleep around.”\n “You\u0027re in love with him?”\n “Yes, I\u0027m afraid so.”\n “He drank from you last night. It wasn\u0027t the first time, was it?”\n When I didn\u0027t answer, he shook his head in disgust. “How can you let him do that? It\u0027s disgusting.”\n I lifted a hand to my neck. “That\u0027s what I thought, too, until it happened to me.” And then I frowned. “Susie\u0027s a Vampire now, remember? What if she wants to taste you? Are you going to refuse?”\n “Damn right,” he said, but I heard the hesitation in his voice and knew he was thinking about it, even if he wouldn\u0027t admit it.\n “It\u0027s quite wonderful.”\n He looked at me as if I had lost my mind. “He\u0027s brainwashed you, hasn\u0027t he?”\n “No, although I guess he could if he wanted to.”\n Cagin grunted softly. “Life sure as hell gets complicated sometimes, doesn\u0027t it?” he muttered, and I knew he wasn\u0027t just talking about himself and Susie.\n Complicated, I thought. That had to be the understatement of the century.\n “I\u0027m still hungry,” he said. “What do you say we order a pizza? With lots of garlic?”\n I grinned, happy to see that his good mood had been restored.\n We spent the next hour watching TV and eating pizza, and then we played cards with a deck I found while snooping in the kitchen drawers.\n “So,” I asked during a lull in the conversation, “what are you and Susie going to do now?”\n “I asked her to marry me.”\n “Oh?”\n “Yeah. She said she\u0027d think about it.” He rubbed his palm against his thigh. “I probably spoke too soon. Hell, I killed her husband. She\u0027s never going to forget that, no matter how long she thinks about it.”\n “You saved her life,” I reminded him. “Twice.” Once when he\u0027d saved her from Rick, and again last night, when he had insisted that Rafe bring her across.\n “I guess it\u0027s all in how you look at it,” he muttered.\n “She cares for you. Anyone can see that.”\n “She\u0027s the first woman I\u0027ve ever loved.” His voice was so low, I could scarcely hear it. “And she\u0027ll be the last.”\n The look in his eyes and the fervent tone of his voice touched a chord deep inside me.\n We played another hand of cards, and then Cagin pushed away from the table and stood. “I\u0027m going to go look in on her.”\n “All right.” I went to the room\u0027s single window and drew back the heavy drapes. Through the thick iron bars, I could see that the sun had gone down. Rafe had said he would rise at sundown. Was he awake? Maybe waiting for me to join him in bed?\n While I was deciding what to do, Cagin returned to the living room. “She\u0027s gone.”\n “Gone?” I shook my head. “How can that be? We\u0027d have seen her leave.”\n “Would we?”\n I hurried down the hallway to Rafe\u0027s bedroom. Opening the door, I peered inside. The sheets were rumpled, but the bed was empty.\n I glanced over my shoulder at Cagin, who was standing in the doorway behind me. “Where can they be?”\n Chapter Twenty-Six\n Susie stared at the young man who stood, unmoving, in front of her, then glanced at Rafe. “I don\u0027t think I can do this.”\n “Sure you can.”\n She looked back at the man that Rafe had mesmerized, her expression doubtful.\n “Susie, stop thinking like a mortal. You\u0027re a Vampire now, and you need to feed. I know you can feel the hunger inside you. Surrender to it, to what you are.”\n “You want me to drink his blood?”\n “It\u0027s what you\u0027re craving,” Rafe said patiently. “It\u0027s the only thing that will relieve the pain. And it\u0027s natural for you now. Sweet, like nothing else.”\n She made a face. “Yuck!”\n “Trust me on this. Here, this will make it easier.” Grasping the man\u0027s shoulders, Rafe scraped his fangs along the side of the man\u0027s neck. A thin ribbon of bright red oozed from the shallow incision. The coppery scent of blood rose in the air.\n Drawn by the scent, Susie took a step forward, her nostrils flaring. Slowly, her eyes took on a faint red glow. Her lips parted, and Rafe saw her fangs, sharp and white and ready. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-40.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) \n Passion Has a Darker Side... \n Kathy McKenna was sure that the little Midwestern town of Oak Hollow would be isolated enough for safety, but the moment the black-clad stranger walked into her bookstore, she knew she was wrong.
