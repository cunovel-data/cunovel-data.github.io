In all his existence, he had thought himself in love only twice. He had killed the first woman; the second one had been the girl he had told Kathy about. He didn\u0027t intend to make the same mistake a third time.\\n\\n But it hadn\u0027t kept him from dissolving into mist and entering the bookstore Friday night. Her scent had surrounded him, tantalizing him even in his intangible form as he hovered in the air near her desk. Drifting there, weightless, shapeless, he had recalled the softness of her skin, the warmth of her smile. He had tortured himself with her nearness until he couldn\u0027t stand it any longer, and then he had fled the building.\\n\\n Resuming his own form, he had preyed upon the first man he had seen. Filled with impotent rage, he had taken the man\u0027s blood quickly, his hands cruel as he held his prey in place. He had been sorely tempted to drink the man dry. He was a Vampire, after all. Why not loose the beast that lurked within and revel in the power that was his? To what purpose did he cling to his humanity? For the approval of a woman who would never be his? He had released his pent-up frustration in a wild cry that had sent an alley cat scurrying for cover. Overcome with guilt and shame, he had released the helpless mortal, wiped the memory of what had happened from the man\u0027s mind, and sent him on his way. Hands tightly clenched, Rafe had watched the man stagger down the street until he was swallowed up in the shadows of the night.\\n\\n Now, as he stalked the dark streets, Rafe couldn\u0027t help wondering what Kathy would think if she could see him at this moment. He didn\u0027t need a mirror to know how he looked now, with his fangs extended and his eyes red and glowing with the lust for blood. He had seen his own image mirrored in his brother\u0027s face often enough.\\n\\n Muttering an oath, he vowed it was a side of him that Kathy would never see. To his regret, the only way to guarantee that she never saw him at his worst was to stay away from her.\\n\\n The thought of never seeing her again was far more painful than he had expected.\\n\\n Rafe grunted softly. He was eighty-five years old; he had been a Vampire for seventy-two of those years. He should be used to pain in all its forms by now.\\n\\n Chapter Seven\\n\\n There was only one church in Oak Hollow, and it was open to everyone who didn\u0027t want to drive the hundred or so miles to River\u0027s Edge, which was the next closest town and catered to all the major religions and a few I\u0027d never heard of.\\n\\n Reverend Paul was standing at the door on Sunday morning, welcoming his parishioners with a smile and a handshake, when I arrived. He was a nice-looking, middle-aged man with short-cropped brown hair and guileless brown eyes.\\n\\n His smile was warm and sincere as he clasped my hand. “Good morning, Kathy. It\u0027s good to see you here.”\\n\\n “Thank you, it\u0027s good to be here.”\\n\\n I found a seat in a pew near the back, my gaze drawn, as always, to the beautiful stained glass window above the altar. In brilliant shades of blue and red, orange and gold, it depicted the Savior of the world sitting on a rock, a tranquil expression on His face as He stroked the head of a tiny black lamb. The rays of a bright sun gilded His hair and white robe.\\n\\n I had mixed emotions when it came to religion. I didn\u0027t put any stock in the big bang theory. I\u0027d heard it said once that believing in the big bang was akin to believing that you could throw all the parts of a car into the air and it would come down fully assembled. I didn\u0027t believe that mankind\u0027s ancestors had crawled out of some primordial soup, either. Evolution just didn\u0027t ring true. Neither hypothesis made sense to me. I believed in the creation story, though I had no idea where dinosaurs, Vampires, and Werewolves fit into the grand scheme of things. All I knew was that my heart and soul filled with a sweet sense of peace and hope when I looked at the Savior of the world as depicted in that stained glass window.\\n\\n Reverend Paul took his place at the pulpit. The congregation sang an opening hymn, the reverend offered a prayer, the congregation sang another hymn, and then the reverend turned to his sermon. I guess the reason I liked him so much was because he didn\u0027t preach hellfire and endless damnation, but love, accountability, and forgiveness.\\n\\n Susie sat across the aisle, her three sons sandwiched between her and her husband. It was the first time I had seen her boys sitting still, and the first time I had seen her husband. He had short blond hair and didn\u0027t look anything like I\u0027d imagined.\\n\\n Catching my gaze, Susie smiled at me. I smiled back, then returned my attention to what the reverend was saying. I tried to concentrate on the sermon, but my thoughts kept ping-ponging between Raphael\u0027s absence and my upcoming date with Cagin.\\n\\n After church, Susie introduced me to her husband, Rick. The three of us made polite chitchat for a few minutes before I excused myself. I thanked the reverend for a fine sermon, then hurried home to change out of my church dress and into a pair of jeans and a sweater. I sliced the devil\u0027s food cake I had made for dessert and put it into a carrier, along with some paper plates, napkins, and plastic forks.\\n\\n Cagin arrived right on time. He looked strong and fit in a pair of faded cutoffs and a white T-shirt that had a snarling tiger painted on the back. “Ready?”\\n\\n “Ready.” I grabbed a jacket from the closet, picked up the small basket that held the cake, and followed him out the door.\\n\\n It was a beautiful day for a drive. The sky was a clear sapphire blue, the weather warm but not hot. The place Cagin had chosen for our picnic was beside a small blue lake. It was a lovely place, flanked by a carpet of thick green grass and tall willow trees. It looked remarkably like the mural I had painted. Ducks and geese floated on the surface of the water. I thought I saw a deer resting in the shade across the way. A hawk soared effortlessly overhead, its wings outstretched.\\n\\n Cagin spread a blanket in the shade of a tree. Opening a huge picnic basket, he doled out china plates, crystal glasses, silverware, and linen napkins, along with a variety of sandwiches and containers of potato salad, baked beans, coleslaw, dill pickles, and olives.\\n\\n “This is some picnic!” I exclaimed as he handed me a glass of chilled champagne.\\n\\n “Nothing but the best.”\\n\\n We passed a pleasant hour over lunch, making small talk and getting to know each other. Cagin owned a number of small businesses in New Jersey, was an only child, had never been married, loved cold beer and fast cars, and collected motorcycles.\\n\\n “A speed freak,” I murmured, smiling. I couldn\u0027t help wondering what he was doing in Oak Hollow.\\n\\n When I asked, he replied, “I\u0027m on vacation, more or less.”\\n\\n “So you\u0027re just passing through?”\\n\\n His gaze raked over me in a way that made me uncomfortable. “I could be talked into staying a while longer.”\\n\\n Since I didn\u0027t know what to say to that, I offered him a slice of cake instead.\\n\\n He took it with a knowing grin, devoured it in three big bites, and stood up.\\n\\n “That lake looks mighty inviting. What do you say we take a swim?”\\n\\n “I didn\u0027t bring a bathing suit.”\\n\\n He looked at me, a challenge in his eyes. “You don\u0027t need one.”\\n\\n “Sorry, but skinny-dipping is out of the question until I know you better. A lot better.”\\n\\n “Whatever floats your boat,” he said, and before I knew what he had in mind, he had stripped to the buff and plunged into the water. He swam to the far side of the lake with long, even strokes, then turned and swam back. When he approached the shore, I turned my back to the water. Call me a prude if you will, but he was a little too cavalier about his nudity for me.\\n\\n Cagin\u0027s amused laughter brought the heat rushing to my cheeks.\\n\\n After he pulled on his shorts and his sandals, we took a walk around the lake, and then, pleading a headache, I asked him to take me home.\\n\\n I thought he would argue with me; instead, he tossed the dishes and leftovers into the basket, draped the blanket and his shirt over his shoulder, and headed for the car.\\n\\n I stared after him. If we hadn\u0027t been so far from town, I would have walked home. Tempting as that was, common sense won out.\\n\\n Needless to say, we didn\u0027t talk much on the way back to my place. I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised if, instead of stopping the car, he had just slowed down and expected me to jump out, but he parked the car and walked me to the door.\\n\\n Delving inside my handbag for my keys, I muttered, “Thanks for the picnic.”\\n\\n He didn\u0027t say anything. Instead, he pulled me into his arms and kissed me, and then, whistling softly, he sauntered back to his car and drove away.\\n\\n I stared after him, confused by both his abrupt change in attitude and his kiss. It hadn\u0027t been a bad kiss, as kisses go, but it hadn\u0027t set me on fire, either.\\n\\n Ah, well, it really didn\u0027t matter, since I\u0027d probably never see him again.\\n\\n The rest of the afternoon stretched before me. Feeling at somewhat of a loss, I grabbed a rag and went from room to room, dusting the furniture. The house wasn\u0027t very big—two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room with a fireplace and hardwood floors, a sunny kitchen, and a small dining room—but it was located on a large lot at the end of a long, narrow street. A white picket fence surrounded the backyard; directly behind the fence was an open field. To the right, a stand of tall timber covered several acres. The only other house on the road was a good distance away.\\n\\n I had fallen in love with the place at first sight. In my spare time, I had repainted the living room, the bathroom, and one of the bedrooms.\\n\\n About eleven o\u0027clock that night, I took a long, hot shower, then slipped into a silky tank top and my favorite pajama bottoms, the ones decorated with tiny blue and purple hearts. After fixing a cup of hot chocolate, I lit a fire in the hearth, then settled down in front of the TV to watch a late movie.\\n\\n I was drifting on the brink of sleep when someone rang the bell. Smothering a yawn, I went to the door. “Who is it?”\\n\\n “Rafe.”\\n\\n The sound of his voice made my heart skip a beat. “What do you want?”\\n\\n “To see you, of course. Why else would I be here?”\\n\\n I glanced at the clock. It was after midnight. It was late for working people like me, but I supposed it was the shank of the evening for a Vampire. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-7.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) \\n Passion Has a Darker Side... \\n Kathy McKenna was sure that the little Midwestern town of Oak Hollow would be isolated enough for safety, but the moment the black-clad stranger walked into her bookstore, she knew she was wrong.
