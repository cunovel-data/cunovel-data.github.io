What a wondrous feeling, to feel his body next to mine, the sensuous slide of wet skin against wet skin.\\n\\n With one arm wrapped around my waist, he kept me afloat easily. His free hand played over my body while he rained kisses on my cheeks, my brow, my chin, the tip of my nose. I tilted my head back, affording myself a view of the stars overhead while granting Rafe access to my throat. I shivered with anticipation at the feel of his tongue against my skin, tangled my fingers in his long hair at the touch of his fangs.\\n\\n Pleasure shot through me from head to foot. Weightless, buoyant, I closed my eyes and gave myself over to the myriad sensations his kisses aroused.\\n\\n “I want you.” His voice rumbled in my ear, deep and husky with desire.\\n\\n I looked at him through heavy-lidded eyes. “Do you?”\\n\\n He growled low in his throat. “Don\u0027t tease me, woman.”\\n\\n “How much do you want me?”\\n\\n He pressed his body against mine, letting me feel his erection.\\n\\n “Ohhh,” I purred. “That much?”\\n\\n He growled again, lower, deeper. “Do you know what happens when you tease a Vampire?”\\n\\n “No,” I said, stifling a grin. “What happens?”\\n\\n “This.” He carried me out of the pool and into the cave, showering me with kisses every step of the way.\\n\\n When we reached the blankets, he sat down, holding me so that my legs straddled his thighs and then, very slowly, he reclined, drawing me down with him so that my body covered his.\\n\\n He stroked my cheek, ran his fingertips over my lips. “You\u0027re beautiful,” he murmured.\\n\\n “So are you.” His body was firm, his skin was unlined, his hair was black and thick, and he would always look this way. When I was gray and wrinkled, he would still be beautiful. When I grew old and feeble, he would still be young and strong. I tried to shake the troublesome thoughts aside, told myself it didn\u0027t matter. I didn\u0027t want to think about such things now, when I was in his arms, but I couldn\u0027t stop. He would never change, never grow old or frail. Would I start to hate him when I began to age and he didn\u0027t?\\n\\n “Ah, Kathy, it doesn\u0027t have to be that way.”\\n\\n “Yes, it does.” I knew he was thinking about Susie. She liked being a Vampire, and that was fine for Susie, but she\u0027d had no choice in the matter. I did, and I didn\u0027t want to be a Vampire.\\n\\n “Do you want to live with one?” Rafe asked quietly.\\n\\n “Is there any way for me to keep you out of my mind?” I asked, exasperated that he read my thoughts so easily.\\n\\n “You can try.”\\n\\n “How do I do it?”\\n\\n “Erect a wall around your thoughts.”\\n\\n “How do I do that?”\\n\\n “Imagine it in your mind. Build it a brick at a time, as high and as thick as you like.”\\n\\n “And that will keep you out?”\\n\\n “If it\u0027s strong enough.” He stroked my cheek with his fingers. “You didn\u0027t answer my question.”\\n\\n “I don\u0027t know.” Tears stung my eyes. Only moments ago, I had been sure Rafe was everything I had ever wanted, but now…Tears of doubt dripped down my cheeks and fell on Rafe\u0027s face. He didn\u0027t wipe them away, only looked up at me through fathomless black eyes, waiting for me to go on. “Make love to me, Rafe. Hold me tight and don\u0027t let me go.”\\n\\n Desperate and afraid to face the future, I needed to be held, needed to feel his arms around me, to hear his voice telling me that he loved me, that everything would be all right.\\n\\n For a minute, I thought he would refuse, but then he cupped my face in his hands and kissed me, slowly, deeply, each kiss longer and more intense than the last. Closing my eyes, I surrendered to his kisses, to the sweet seduction of his hands moving over my damp skin, large hands that gently caressed me. His voice moved over me like rough velvet as he whispered love words in my ear, sometimes in English, sometimes in a language I didn\u0027t understand.\\n\\n I clung to him, holding him tight, tighter, afraid that if I let go, I\u0027d be lost. When I was ready for him, when I was sure I couldn\u0027t wait another minute, he wrapped one arm around me and rolled over, carrying me with him, so that he was on top. I cried out with pleasure as his body merged with mine.\\n\\n And even then, I knew he was saying good-bye.\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-Nine\\n\\n When I woke in the morning, Rafe was gone. The words gone for good echoed in the back of my mind, and I knew I had lost him and it was nobody\u0027s fault but my own. Even though I loved him, I didn\u0027t have enough faith in myself, or in our love, to believe it would last. I wasn\u0027t brave enough to face the future at his side. I couldn\u0027t keep from thinking that the day would come when he would turn to someone younger and prettier, or worse, to a Vampire who could share his whole life, who would understand him in ways that I never could or would.\\n\\n I sat up, noting that Rafe had covered me with a blanket and left the candles burning. His thoughtfulness brought quick tears to my eyes.\\n\\n I spent the day in the cave. When I wasn\u0027t crying, I swam in the pool or napped in the shade. Late in the afternoon, I rummaged in the sack to see what Rafe had brought. I found apples and oranges, some string cheese, a box of crackers, a couple of bottles of water, and several of my favorite candy bars.\\n\\n Toward evening, I got dressed, and after gathering up the food sack and my handbag, I left the cave, wondering how I\u0027d get back to town.\\n\\n I should have known Rafe wouldn\u0027t leave me stranded out in the middle of nowhere. His car was still parked at the bottom of the hill.\\n\\n Driving home, all I could think was, how had things gone so bad so fast? One minute everything had been wonderful, and the next, I was pushing Rafe away because I couldn\u0027t stand the thought that he would never change. People in love always talked about growing old together, and while I wasn\u0027t looking forward to growing old, I knew I didn\u0027t want to grow old by myself. But did I want to grow old without Rafe? It seemed a moot point now.\\n\\n It was still early when I pulled up in front of my house. I sat there for a minute, staring blankly out the windshield. There was nothing here for me now, I thought. I would put the house up for sale and close up the store, maybe go home and spend some time with my folks.\\n\\n With my mind made up, I got out of the car.\\n\\n At the front door, I put my key in the lock, but there was no need. The door swung open on its own. A closer look showed the lock had been broken.\\n\\n Turning on my heels, I ran down the stairs and climbed into Rafe\u0027s car. I didn\u0027t know who had broken into my house, but I had a pretty good idea. I doubted if they were still inside, waiting for me, but I wasn\u0027t about to find out.\\n\\n Without a backward glance, I drove out of Oak Hollow just as fast as I could.\\n\\n I drove until I reached River\u0027s Edge, and then I pulled into the parking lot of the first motel I saw.\\n\\n Five minutes later, I locked myself in Room 9. I pulled the drapes over the windows before I turned on the lights. I stood there a minute, wondering if I had overreacted, but my mother had always said it was better to err on the side of caution than wake up dead in a ditch.\\n\\n I smiled at the memory, then sat on the edge of the bed and switched on the TV. I was surfing through the channels when I heard a reporter say, “This just in from Oak Hollow.”\\n\\n As I listened to his report, I knew that leaving Oak Hollow had been the smart thing to do.\\n\\n Two photographs were flashed on the screen. I recognized Jennifer and Gary immediately, listened with mounting horror as the reporter related how the two had been found dead in their homes, both dispatched by a single gunshot to the back of the head while they slept.\\n\\n Pulling my cell phone from my bag, I quickly punched in Susie\u0027s number. She answered on the second ring. “Kathy?”\\n\\n “Hi, are you all right?”\\n\\n “We\u0027re fine. I just heard about Gary and Jennifer on the radio. Where are you?”\\n\\n “I\u0027m at a motel in River\u0027s Edge. Where are you?”\\n\\n “With Joe. We\u0027re on our way to pick up my kids, and then we\u0027re getting out of town.”\\n\\n She was probably smart to take her kids. I doubted if either Edna or Pearl would have any scruples about using three innocent kids to get to Susie.\\n\\n “What about your folks?” I asked. “They could be in danger, too.”\\n\\n “I convinced them to take a little vacation.”\\n\\n “Good. Listen, we need to warn those two men that were with us that they\u0027re in danger,” I said, “but how? I don\u0027t even know their names.”\\n\\n “I don\u0027t know. Joe thinks it\u0027s probably too late.”\\n\\n Just then, pictures of the two men appeared on the screen.\\n\\n “Local police are calling the killings the work of a serial killer,” the reporter said. “If you have any information…”\\n\\n I turned the volume down. “Cagin was right,” I said. “We\u0027re too late.”\\n\\n “Joe wants to know if you\u0027re with Rafe. He wants to ask him…”\\n\\n “I don\u0027t know where he is.”\\n\\n There was a moment of silence, and then Susie said, “Keep in touch, all right?”\\n\\n “I will. If you hear anything…”\\n\\n “We\u0027ll let you know. Joe wants to know if you want to meet us somewhere tomorrow. He thinks we should stick together.”\\n\\n Safety in numbers. Ordinarily, it was a good idea, but I couldn\u0027t help wondering if that was true now. “I\u0027ll let you know tomorrow,” I said. “How\u0027s your face?”\\n\\n “It burns like the very devil, but at least it won\u0027t leave any scars. Be careful, Kathy.”\\n\\n “You, too.”\\n\\n I watched the rest of the news, relieved that there was no mention of Jimmy and Gina or Rafe, and then switched off the set.\\n\\n Of the twelve people who had been subjected to Pearl\u0027s formula, two of the Werewolves had died from the injection. Four of the others had been executed. There was no doubt in my mind that Edna and Pearl were behind the killings. Clearly, the women intended to do away with those of us who had survived as quickly as possible so there would be no witnesses, no one left to go to the police. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-45.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) \\n Passion Has a Darker Side... \\n Kathy McKenna was sure that the little Midwestern town of Oak Hollow would be isolated enough for safety, but the moment the black-clad stranger walked into her bookstore, she knew she was wrong.
