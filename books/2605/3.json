{"id":97995,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Incident Report filed by Special Deputy Jameson Arkeley, 10/4/83 (Concluded): Slowly, achingly, warmth returned to my fingertips, my toes. My brain spun inside my head for a while and I couldn\u0027t make any sense of my surroundings, I could just hear ringing in my ears. I could taste my own death on the back of my tongue. I had come that close.\\n\\n Lares bent over me, his fingers probing in my ears and mouth. He tore my shirt away from my neck and shoulder and probed the veins there, tapping at them to get the circulation going. Then he left me there, unbound, all but forgotten. He hadn\u0027t said a word to me, not one word. I wasn\u0027t supposed to be a hostage, I realized. I was going to be a midnight snack. I\u0027d made enough heat for him that he felt he had to run home, to go to ground. That didn\u0027t mean he had to go hungry. My eyes adjusted to the absolute darkness of the boat\u0027s hold, eventually, and I began to make out some details. It was a cramped little space that smelled of diesel fuel and mildew. It was cold, not as cold as it had been under the river but icy cold all the same. I guess if you\u0027re dead you don\u0027t need central heating. The usual boat stuff filled most corners of the room-life preservers like giant orange candies, a pair of aluminum oars, folded tarpaulins and sailcloth. Five coffins were leaned up against the shelves and bulwarks or lay flat on the floor. They were relatively plain, dark wood affairs in that elongated hexagonal shape that says \"coffin\" whenever you see it, even though I don\u0027t think anyone had built a coffin like that in fifty years. They had brass handles and they were all propped open so I could see the overstuffed satin linings. One of them was empty. It was the biggest and it looked about the right size for Lares. It would have looked comical, even cartoonish, except in juxtaposition with the other four, which were all occupied. The bodies in the coffins were decayed beyond recognition. They were bones, mostly, tied together with scraps of flesh. Some showed old brown stains where blood had washed over them. One had nearly a full head of long white hair like uncombed cotton. One had a single eyeball still in his head, though it was shrunken and dried up until it looked like a white prune. None of the skulls were human. The jaws were thick, sturdy bone full of broken teeth. Just from the teeth I knew they were all vampires. Maybe they were Lares\u0027 family, in a perverse way. Maybe there was a whole lineage of them sleeping in that cramped little ship\u0027s hold. There was something about them, something that made my skin crawl. It took me a long time to realize what it was. The bones in those coffins weren\u0027t dead. They were moving. Just barely, just almost imperceptibly, but the bony hands were reaching out. The necks were craning forward. They wanted something. They were desperate for it, desperate enough to strain their dried-up sinews to get at it. As decayed and dilapidated as they might be, these corpses were still undead and still aware of their surroundings. Vampires were supposed to live forever, if they weren\u0027t killed. I guess maybe they didn\u0027t stay young forever, though. Maybe that was too much to ask.\\n\\n Lares caught my attention as he started moving around the little space. He looked different. I focused my eyes and saw that the curly hair on top his head had been a wig-it was gone now and his head was as white and as round as the moon. Triangular ears poked out on either side. Those weren\u0027t human ears. I guess I was finally seeing what a vampire really looked like. It wasn\u0027t pretty. Lares knelt next to one of the coffins, his hands bracing him on the wooden lip. He lowered his head over the body and his back began to shake. One of his laughing eyes kept me pinned the whole time. With a horrible retching sound he vomited a half pint of blood into the coffin, right over the corpse\u0027s face. He clutched at his sides and heaved again, and again, until the skull was bathed in clotted gore. Steam rose from the hot blood in the cold room. Steam wreathed the skull, the rib cage of the corpse. Steam coalesced like watery light around the bones, wrapping the vampire remains in illusory flesh and skin. The body plumped out and began to take on something like human form as the blood dripped into the corpse\u0027s mouth. Lares moved to the next corpse. He started coughing and blood flecked his lips. Like a mother bird feeding her young he coughed himself into a spasm until blood dangled in thick ropes from his mouth. Where it touched the corpse steam rose up and a second transformation began. Skin like old mildewed paper rattled as it stretched around the second corpse\u0027s ruin. Dark skin, criss-crossed with scars. This one had a tattoo on his bicep. It read \"SPQR\" in jagged, sloppily-done letters. The pink hue I\u0027d seen in Lares\u0027 cheeks before was gone. He was white as a sheet again. If he was going to feed all of his ancestors he would need to find another blood donor, and soon.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t like my chances.\\n\\n He managed to vomit up blood all over a third corpse, just with what he had inside of him. He was throwing up death. The death of the waitress in the diner. The deaths of the SWATs we\u0027d foolishly thought were safe under twenty pounds of crosses. He was throwing up bits of Webster, the good cop, throwing up part of Webster\u0027s body.\\n\\n Lares turned to look at me directly. His whole body was shaking. Trembling, even shivering. Feeding his grandparents had taken everything he had. Before he\u0027d fed on the waitress in the diner, had he been this shaky? He tried to meet my gaze but I refused to let him hypnotize me again.\\n\\n I looked down at my right hand. I was still carrying my sidearm. How I could have held onto it through being carried over Lares\u0027 shoulder, through the shock of hitting the river, through being dragged into the boat was a mystery. The cold must have turned my hand into a solid claw around the weapon.\\n\\n Lares lurched toward me. His speed was gone. His coordination was shot. He was still a bulletproof vampire.\\n\\n I knew it was hopeless. The SWATs had hit him center left with full automatic machine gun fire but the bullets had never even pierced his skin. They hadn\u0027t even grazed his heart, the only vulnerable part of him. I had nothing better to do at that moment, though, then to shoot every last bullet I had.\\n\\n I discharged my weapon into his chest. I shot him. Again and again until I was deaf with the noise and blind with the muzzle flash. I had three bullets left in my gun and I put all of them into his chest. The hollow point rounds tore him open, splatted the boat\u0027s hold with bits and strips of his white, white skin. He tried to laugh but his voice came out as a weak hiss, air escaping from a punctured tire. I saw his rib cage torn open, exposed, flayed. I saw his lungs, slack and lifeless in his chest. He came closer. Closer. Closer. Close enough-I reached out with my left hand and grabbed at the twisted dark muscle that had once been his heart. He howled in pain. So did I. His body was already repairing the damage I\u0027d done, his cells knitting back together around the gun shot wounds. His ribs grew back like scissor blades crunching down on the more fragile bones of my wrist, trapping my hand inside of his body. His skin grew back over my arm and pulled at me, pulled me toward him.\\n\\n I plucked his heart out like pulling a peach off a tree.\\n\\n Lares\u0027 face turned dark with horror, his eyes wild, his mouth flapping open like he couldn\u0027t control it, blood and spit flying from his chin. His nostrils flared and a stench like an open sewer bellowed up out of every one of his orifices. The heart leapt in my hand, trying to get back where it belonged, but I used the tiny shred of strength left to me to squeeze, to hold on. Lares slapped at me with his hands but there was no real strength left in his muscles. He dropped to his knees and howled and howled and howled. It started to sound like mewling after a while. He was losing the strength to even scream properly.\\n\\n Still he wouldn\u0027t just die. He was holding on to what strange kind of unlife he had ever possessed, clutching like a junkie at an empty syringe, trying through sheer willpower to not die.\\n\\n His eyes met mine and he tried to suck me in. He tried to hypnotize me, to weaken me once more. It didn\u0027t work.\\n\\n When he finally stopped moving it was nearly dawn. I held his heart in my clenched fist and it felt like an inert stone. The other vampires, the decayed ones, came slithering out of their coffins, reaching for him, reaching for me. They didn\u0027t understand what had happened. They were blind and deaf and dumb and all they knew was the taste of blood. I kicked them away and through the pain, through the shock, managed to get to my feet.\\n\\n I found a can of gasoline in the engine room. I found a matchbook in the disused galley of the boat. I set them all on fire and stumbled up and out into the cold rain, pitched headlong onto a narrow wooden dock and waited for the sun to come up, waited to see if the local police would find me first, or whether hypothermia and my injuries and general horror would finish me off. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/13-bullets-laura-caxton-vampires-1/page-3.html","bookId":2605,"book":{"id":2605,"title":"13 Bullets (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1)","description":"Storyline: 13 Bullets: A Vampire Tale (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1) \\n Thirteen Bullets takes place in Pennsylvania in the year 2003, in a setting similar to the real world, but where vampires and other supernatural forces are rare but accepted phenomena.
