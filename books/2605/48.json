{"id":98039,"no":48,"title":"Page 48","content":"Deanna was dead, truly dead. It wasn\u0027t hard to accept on a factual basis. Caxton could hold the knowledge in her head, she could walk around it, see it from all angles. She could see the repercussions, the paperwork she would need to file. She would have to cancel all of Deanna\u0027s magazine subscriptions, for instance. She would have to change their insurance coverage, a precariously balanced set of documents which allowed Caxton to pay for Deanna\u0027s medical bills with her own state employee insurance.\\n\\n That didn\u0027t begin to explain how she felt, however. The nitty gritty details of Deanna\u0027s life didn\u0027t add up to what had just happened. Deanna was dead. It was like the color blue had stopped existing. Something Caxton had always counted on, something she had built an entire life around, wasn\u0027t there anymore. It wasn\u0027t fear of loneliness or loss of companionship that bothered her most. It was this existential hole in her world view. Deanna was gone-forever-and it had happened just like that, in the time it took to say out loud: Deanna was dead. She found herself driving home, much, much later, an hour or two after sunset. Roxie Purfleet had taken over her duties at the hospital, convinced she knew best what her daughter wanted done with her mortal remains. She\u0027d refused to let Caxton even help plan the memorial service. Deanna\u0027s body would go back to Boalsburg, where she\u0027d been born. Caxton had listened a million times to Deanna moan and bitch about the place, about how she\u0027d longed to get away from it as early as elementary school. But that\u0027s where she would be forever, now. Driving-Caxton was driving, she needed to focus on that. She watched the yellow lines on the road but soon found herself fixated on them, unable to look away. She forced herself to check her mirrors and her blind spot. Deanna was dead. She wanted to call Deanna up and talk to her about what had just happened. She wanted to sit on the couch with the TV turned off for a second and just talk about what it all meant. Who else could she trust with such monumental news? Who else could she go to first?\\n\\n Driving. Right. Caxton squinted as a semi roared past in the other direction, its headlights smearing brilliant light across her face. She blinked away the after-images and focused on the car, on the speedometer, on the gas gauge. Anything to keep her in the here and now.\\n\\n Elvin, who was perhaps the only person in the world with less of a grip on what had happened than herself, had been kind enough to drive her back to Troop H\\n\\n headquarters where she\u0027d left her car. It hadn\u0027t been touched since she\u0027d suited up to get onboard the Granola Roller. She\u0027d gone up and touched the patrol car\u0027s metal skin as if it were a special machine that could take her back in time, to before Deanna died, to before she became half of a vampire. Then she\u0027d turned around because she felt Elvin behind her, just standing there. His body sort of hovered halfway between leaving and coming closer, a mass being turned this way and that by some sort of emotional physics. Looming was the word that came to mind. He loomed over her and frowned, deep and long, and finally spoke.\\n\\n \"She really loved you,\" he said. \"She swore it. When I first found out she was a fag I was going to cream her, but then she said she really loved you, and I figured that made it okay. I mean, you don\u0027t pick who you love. Nobody does.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose not,\" Caxton had replied, unsure what he wanted. A hug? A reminiscence of his sister?\\n\\n \"Thanks for the ride,\" she\u0027d said, and he had nodded, and that was that. She blinked back a half-formed, inexplicable tear. Oh, God, driving-she had to watch where she was driving. She\u0027d just missed the turn-off. She stopped the car and looked behind her. There was no one on the road back there. Slowly, with a noise of rumbling gravel, she backed and filled until she was headed back the right way. Then she drove up to the house without losing track of time even once. She switched off the car and the headlights disappeared and everything was dark. She sat in the cooling car and stared at the dark house. Deanna had always left a light on for her before.\\n\\n It was only the whining of the dogs that spurred her to action. She had forgotten them-how could she forget them? But she had, she had forgotten her dogs and they hadn\u0027t eaten in over a day. They were watered automatically with a gravity bottle but they hadn\u0027t eaten. They would be starving. She didn\u0027t even go into the house, just ran back to the kennels and grabbed a twenty-pound bag of kibble. She switched on the lights inside the kennel and gasped.\\n\\n The dogs looked okay-but something had tried to tear their cages open. The greyhounds lay curled up behind warped and bent bars, crying and whining and yawning in fearful confusion. Blood and what looked like a strip of cloth hung on the bars near her. Caxton stepped closer and touched the damaged cage. It wasn\u0027t cloth. It was corroded flesh, torn off in a hurry. A half-dead had been there and not very long before. Clearly it had meant to kill the dogs, only to get its arm torn open instead.\\n\\n She let the dogs out and hugged them and poured them bowls of food. Hunger won out over their bewilderment and they ate greedily. She squeezed vitamins from a plastic bottle into the kibble and left them at it. Then she went back to her car and retrieved her Beretta and the box of cross points. With fumbling, half-frozen hands she loaded the pistol and then she went to the front door of the house. Why had they come? She had expected they would leave the house alone, if nobody was inside. She couldn\u0027t figure it out. She touched the knob of the door and knew instantly that it was unlocked.\\n\\n Careful, wary of anyone who might be waiting just inside, she slipped on her flashlight and stepped through the door.\\n\\n Cold silence blew past her, cold air rushing through the house. It leaked in around the cardboard over the kitchen window, the window that had killed Deanna. It swept down the hallway toward their bedroom. She reached for the light switch but it did nothing when she flicked it. She looked up and saw that the light fixtures in the hall had been smashed, all the bulbs broken.\\n\\n Even in the darkness she could see the house had been ransacked. Sheets lay twisted and strewn across the hall as if they\u0027d been dragged off the bed. Plates and pots and the iron skillet had been jumbled all together and thrown in a corner. Some were broken, but there had been no method to it. Whoever had done this had been in a hurry, or perhaps a frenzy. The pictures were torn off the walls and thrown on the floor. Her flashlight beam struck one of them and dazzled her with the reflection off the glass. She looked closer. It was a picture of Deanna and Caxton at an agility tournament, the two of them bent low, beckoning Wilbur across a balance beam. God, what an amazing day that had been. The glass was cracked and the frame broken. She fished the photo out and put it in her pocket, trying to save something. The bedroom was a real mess. Sharp claws or maybe knives had torn up the mattress and bits and pieces of foam rubber were scattered everywhere. Caxton\u0027s closet had been rifled, most of her clothes just dumped in a heap. It was going to take so long to clean this all up, she thought. She turned around and gasped again when she saw that the intruder had left her a message. It covered half the bedroom wall and it looked like it had been painted in blood:\\n\\n NO LIFE\u003d NO SLEEP\\n\\n BE WITH ME\\n\\n She didn\u0027t need a signature to know who had sent the message. It had to be Scapegrace, the last of Justinia Malvern\u0027s brood. He wanted her to finish the transformation that Reyes had started. He was waiting for her to commit suicide and come be his partner in reviving Malvern. He must have somehow convinced himself that destroying her home would be an incentive toward that end. Maybe he thought it would depress her.\\n\\n The piece of Reyes still curled around her brain pulsed, rejecting the idea, and she understood, a little-or rather she knew how little Scapegrace understood. Vampirism had been a dark gift as far as the teenager was concerned. How could anyone not want that power and strength? He was telling her she no longer needed to sleep, that she could break out of the prison of her frail human flesh and emotions and become so much more.\\n\\n \"Then why does he cut off his own ears every sundown?\" she asked, but Reyes fell silent on that matter. Thinking of the dead boy made her more sad than angry. Petty destruction of other people\u0027s property was the only outlet left for his rage, now that he had destroyed himself.\\n\\n She checked the rest of the house but there was no one there. Scapegrace and his minions were long gone. She took another look at the bed and realized she would never be able to spend the night there. She decided to call Clara and see if her invitation still held. To get a better signal she headed out back, toward Deanna\u0027s shed. The door stood unlocked and ajar, of course. Scapegrace had tried to hurt her dogs. He hated everything about the living. He would have destroyed Deanna\u0027s art as well.\\n\\n She stepped inside and closed her phone before she\u0027d even found Clara\u0027s number. She switched on the lights and they actually worked, the bare hundred watt bulbs in the ceiling flaring to life. The shed looked completely untouched. The three sheets hung slack from the ceiling, the light filtering yellow and red through the cloth. Perhaps Scapegrace had seen something in Deanna\u0027s art. Maybe he approved of using blood as a medium-though surely he wouldn\u0027t have known what kind of blood it was. She turned to head back outside and stopped because she heard a footfall that wasn\u0027t hers.\\n\\n \"Laura,\" someone said, and for a bad moment she thought it was her father\u0027s ghost inhabiting the sheets, just as he had inhabited the teleplasm in Urie Polder\u0027s barn.\\n\\n It was Arkeley who stepped out from behind the artwork, however.\\n\\n \"Special Deputy,\" she said, her heart racing at first. It slowed down as she watched him come closer. She thought it might stop. \"I didn\u0027t expect to see you here.\"\\n\\n His face was creased with sorrow. \"Laura,\" he said again, \"I\u0027m so sorry. I didn\u0027t want to bring you this far into this.\"\\n\\n Was he actually apologizing for getting Deanna killed? Grief was like some kind of thicker skin she\u0027d put on. Whatever he was saying just didn\u0027t get through to her.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s alright,\" she said. It wasn\u0027t, but the words came out of her like a yawn, completely unavoidable.\\n\\n \"I needed bait, you see. I needed you because they needed you. The only way to escape a trap is to spring it before they\u0027re ready, remember?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve taught me so much.\" It was her body talking, not her heart. Her body wanted to go to bed. Clara. She had to call Clara, Clara had to come pick her up. It would be at least an hour before she could sleep. She started texting Clara because it was easier somehow than talking to her on the phone. She was done talking for the night.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand-\" Arkeley insisted, but she shook her head. \"Laura, you need to focus right now.\" He stormed toward her and she was sure he was going to hit her again. She stopped breathing and her eyes went wide.\\n\\n \"What is so important?\" she asked, finally finding her own voice. \"What is so fucking important that I have to listen to you, tonight of all nights?\"\\n\\n Arkeley drew his weapon. A little gasp came out of her-she had no idea what he was doing.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re outside,\" he told her. \"Waiting for us to walk out of here. Dozens of half-deads and at least two vampires.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/13-bullets-laura-caxton-vampires-1/page-48.html","bookId":2605,"book":{"id":2605,"title":"13 Bullets (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1)","description":"Storyline: 13 Bullets: A Vampire Tale (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1) \\n Thirteen Bullets takes place in Pennsylvania in the year 2003, in a setting similar to the real world, but where vampires and other supernatural forces are rare but accepted phenomena.
