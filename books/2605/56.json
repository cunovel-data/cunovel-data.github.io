She crouched down in the dark and tried to control her heartbeat and her breathing. Her blood was beating so loudly in her ears she thought anyone nearby must be able to hear it. Blood. That was the problem, wasn\u0027t it? She was full of blood. The half-deads wanted to spill it, maybe in revenge for what she\u0027d done to them and their masters. Maybe because when you were undead all you had in your heart was jealousy directed at the living. They wanted her blood. Then there was the vampire, the unknown vampire haunting the sanatorium, also searching for her, also wanting her blood. But for a different reason. She heard a half-dead moving nearby. Its feet made less sound on the linoleum than a cat might make padding through a garden, but she heard it. Nothing like fear to concentrate the senses. She had three bullets left. She knew better than to think they would be any use to her. She could put one of them in her own heart-that way she would at least not come back as a vampire. Alternatively she could put one in her head. Then she would come back. Would that be so very terrible? It would be a betrayal of Arkeley, true. But then he had never liked her. If she made herself a vampire at least her life wouldn\u0027t end. It would change in many ways. But it wouldn\u0027t end. \"Yes,\" Reyes said, inside of her head. He\u0027d been quiet all night. Either he was losing his grip on her, fading away, or he was just biding his time. \"Yes,\" someone else agreed. \"In the head.\" Someone else. A full-body shiver made her twitch in the shadows. She heard the prowling half-dead stop not ten feet away. She held her breath until he walked past her hiding place. When he was gone from earshot she let herself exhale a little. Somebody else had spoken to her from inside her head. It hadn\u0027t sounded like Reyes at all. Somebody else was in there. \"All of you can just shut the hell up,\" she told them. A splintered chuckling sounded in the back of her throat as if she\u0027d been laughing to herself. Not nice, she thought, but she didn\u0027t want to give them the satisfaction of a response. She got up and made her way to end of the dark hallway, using little bursts of light from her mini-Maglite to find her way. The corridor opened out at its end to a wider hallway full of flats of building supplies-stacks of shingles and neat bundles of replacement floor tiles, pallets of lumber, row after row of sealed white plastic buckets full of plastering compound. Moonlight streamed in through a hole in the ceiling and painted everything a ghostly silver, but even in that eerie light Caxton could see the supplies must have been left there untouched for years, bought for some project that never really got started. Maybe they\u0027d planned on fixing the hole in the roof. The wood was worm-eaten and slimy to the touch while some of the buckets had corroded away and spilled white powder in long sinuous drifts across the floor. She approached carefully, knowing that anything could be hiding in the shadows just outside the patch of moonlight. She glanced down at the powder spread across the floor. The wind coming down from the ceiling listlessly stirred the plaster. Slowly it worked at filling in a line of footprints. Laura was no tracker but she could see the feet were no bigger than her own. The tracks were fresh, too, sharply defined. A barefoot woman had come that way recently. \"Laura,\" someone said in a room nearby. Or had they? Caxton\u0027s mind wasn\u0027t just playing tricks on her, she had a whole Vegas-quality magic show going on in there. She couldn\u0027t be sure of anything. What she had heard sounded like a cough more than a word. And it sounded more like the building settling than like a cough. If she hadn\u0027t know better she could have convinced herself it was just her imagination. The footprints lead her eye to a wide set of double doors across the hallway. Black paint on the doors said INVALID WARD. Someone was sending her a message-she was supposed to go through those doors. It was a trap. Arkeley had taught her about traps. Shaking more than she would have liked, Caxton stepped up to the doors and pushed one of them open. It slid away from her easily, its hinges creaking just a little. The room beyond was cavernous and extremely dark. Her light showed her that it had been stripped bare of anything that could be moved. All that remained in the room were cast iron bedframes painted with flaking white enamel. There were dozens of them, maybe a hundred. Some had been pushed into a corner and some effort had been made to stack them on top of each other. The majority remained exactly where they\u0027d been when the sanatorium was abandoned, standing in neat rows that ran away from her into impenetrable darkness. How many people, how many generations of people had died in that room? How many men had lain in those beds coughing away their lives until someone came to cart their lifeless bodies away? How many ghosts did they leave behind? Caxton\u0027s father had died like that, one little hitching cough at a time. He had died in a bed like- Feather-light and soft something tapped her shoulder. A fear leapt on her then, not an emotion but a living, breathing thing that crawled around her shoulders and neck as if looking for some place to hide. Caxton wanted to run. She wanted to scream. She tried to turn around and found that her body was completely paralyzed by fear. Caxton stopped in her tracks and flicked off the light. Slowly she tried to breathe again. It pretty much worked. \"Laura.\" Wind in some trees, maybe, making branches rub together. Yeah, sure. Trees. Maybe the first time she could have believed that. Through sheer dint of repetition she knew what it had to be. It was a vampire and the vampire was playing with her like a cat playing with a wounded starling. The skin on her arms erupted in goose pimples. It might be Malvern. The bath of blood might have given the moribund vampire enough strength to call out like that from the other side of the sanatorium. Or it could be the other vampire, the complete unknown. A cold breeze brushed across Caxton\u0027s face, ruffling her hair. There had been no wind in the passage before-either someone had opened a door somewhere or-or- She couldn\u0027t help it. She had to know. She flicked on the flashlight just in time to see a pale hand flash away from her, dripping red. She gasped in horror and spun around, trying to find where the owner of the hand had gone. She couldn\u0027t see anything. She flicked the light off again and brought her weapon down to low ready. Three. A second passed and then another and nothing happened. Caxton wanted to turn the light back on. She told herself she was only handicapping herself by not having it on. Vampires could see living people in the dark. They could see their blood. She imagined the vampire at that very moment looking at her. Would the vampire see her frightened face or just the blood surging inside her veins? She imagined what that must look like: the branching network of her blood vessels as if they\u0027d been carefully surgically removed and then hung from the ceiling by wires. A human-enough shape, but empty, a throbbing tracery, bright red jagged lines pulsing tremulously in the cold air. The vampire had to be within striking distance. At any moment he or she could pounce and tear Caxton apart. What was the hold-up? Standing there waiting for her own destruction, imagining the pain to come, was almost worse than actually dying. She flicked on the light and held it straight out, daring the vampire to show itself. And the vampire obliged, stepping right into the path of the beam. Thirty feet away, or maybe farther, the light showed her little more than a pale human outline. The vampire wore a white lacy dress that looked oddly familiar to Caxton, as if she\u0027d seen it in a magazine or something. The colorless hands were full of blood. Caxton had seen this apparition before. In the car, when she had passed out because she was so frightened. She had seen this vampire with bloody hands, beckoning, calling to her. Now the hands lifted, palms held out as if to catch Caxton\u0027s light. The red fell away through the fingers. It wasn\u0027t blood at all, Caxton saw. It was hair, clumps of short red hair. \"It all came out at once, Pumpkin,\" the vampire said, moving closer. She moved so easily she might have been skating across the floor. \"I thought you might like to see it one last time before it\u0027s gone.\" Caxton\u0027s bones hardened in place. She felt as if she were being fossilized. The sound that creaked up out of her wasn\u0027t a name, it was the noise rocks make when they freeze in the winter and crack and split open. By the time it reached Caxton\u0027s lips, though, that noise sounded an awful lot like Deanna\u0027s name.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/13-bullets-laura-caxton-vampires-1/page-56.html","bookId":2605,"book":{"id":2605,"title":"13 Bullets (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1)","description":"Storyline: 13 Bullets: A Vampire Tale (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1) Thirteen Bullets takes place in Pennsylvania in the year 2003, in a setting similar to the real world, but where vampires and other supernatural forces are rare but accepted phenomena.
