{"id":98030,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"She awoke to find moonlight pooling on her face. She blinked away the silver illumination and sat up. The moon was coming in through a broken pane in the mill\u0027s high windows, painting a broad rectangular patch of floor with its light. Caxton tried to stand up. It wasn\u0027t easy. Her entire midsection screamed with pain every time she moved, a tearing pain as if she were being pulled to pieces. Her legs ached where the half-deads had cut her the day before. Her head was full of ugly things and she kept having to snort and clear her throat and spit out bloody mucus. Some of the things in her lungs wouldn\u0027t come out no matter how much she blew her nose. Slowly, mindful of her aching rib cage, she rose to her feet and looked around. Reyes was nowhere in sight. The half-deads and their fire were halfway across the mill. She had moved, or been moved, in her sleep until she was well out of earshot of her captors. Nobody was watching her. Nothing kept her from running away. She felt like cold water was pouring down her back. It was impossible. She had been given a reprieve-somehow the vampire and his minions had just decided to ignore her. Did they think she was still unconscious, perhaps sleep-walking around the mill? Did they think that she was too weak to get away? It was too good to be true, she knew that, it had to be some kind of trap, but she also knew she had to capitalize on whatever small freedom she\u0027d been allowed. Keeping an eye on the half-deads around the fire she hurried toward the wall of the mill. A pile of broken carts had been left there, miniature rail cars that had once moved ingots from one side of the mill to the other. The jagged wood and rusted wheels made a lot of noise as she clambered up to the top of the heap but there was no way to silence them. The pile shifted under her feet and hands but it was stable enough to let her get up to the bottom ledge of the tall windows. She found a broken pane, an open space as wide as her hand filled with chicken wire. Shards of frosted glass still hung from the wire. She carefully brushed them away and looked out. The moon lit up a rural landscape for her, a tableau of black trees swaying and bending in the cold wind. A vacant lot stood directly behind the mill, perhaps a parking lot once or a railyard that had been so overgrown by weeds it no long served any purpose at all. A few rows of fifty-gallon oil drums stood forgotten and skeletonized by rust directly below her. There was no way out. She was perhaps twenty feet up in the air. Even if she could break out the glass and somehow get through the wire she would have to drop to an unknown surface and trust she didn\u0027t break her legs in the process. Something moved behind her and she panicked and nearly fell off the heap of broken carts. She looked back and saw a group of half-deads in the center of the mill floor. They held torches and were muttering amongst themselves. They weren\u0027t looking at her but they had to see her-didn\u0027t they? Maybe their vision wasn\u0027t as good as hers. Maybe she was overestimating them. Caxton turned her face once more to the broken window. It was good, it was helpful, just to get a whiff of fresh air. In a moment she knew she would be discovered and put back to sleep. Just a glimpse of moonlight on trees was worth the effort. She breathed in deeply-and nearly choked. The air outside was foul with the smell of baking manure. She turned away from the window and tried not to cough. The half-deads were pulling on a chain hanging from the ceiling. The chain rattled through their skeletal hands and then suddenly it took on a life of its own. A counterweight descended quickly from the rafters as another chain shot toward the ceiling. A bundle wrapped in canvas was tied to the counterweight. Caxton was not too surprised when the half-deads cut it loose and it turned out to be a human corpse, a heavyset woman in the brown uniform of a UPS driver. She looked very pale, which meant she must have been drained of blood. One of Reyes\u0027 victims. The half-deads laid her out carefully on the floor and unbuttoned her clothing but didn\u0027t remove any of it. It looked like they were trying to make her comfortable, strangely enough. The vampire came out of the shadows then. He had been lying on a flow of hardened slag, a pale spot in the shadows. He had been no more than twenty feet away from her the whole time. Hope slipped away from Caxton like water down a drain. The whole time she\u0027d been climbing the broken carts and sniffing the foul air outside he must have been watching her. Well, of course he had. He wasn\u0027t stupid enough to let her wander around unsupervised. He didn\u0027t so much as glance at her, though. He walked over to the corpse and touched the dead woman\u0027s chest with one of his hands. His hand pressed against where her heart would be. He stared deeply into her glassy, sightless eyes, and muttered something in his low, growling voice. The woman\u0027s body started to twitch, muscles jumping here and there under her clothes. \"Come back,\" Reyes said. He was calling her-literally calling her back from death. \"Come back and serve me. Come back and serve me!\" The twitches graduated into full-blown convulsions, her heels kicking against the floor, her head flopping back and forth like a fish cast up on a dry wooden wharf. Her body stiffened with the spasm and a sour reek split the air, similar to the manure smell from outside but much sharper and more pungent. The dead woman\u0027s hands curled into wicked claws as she reached for her face. Slowly, she sat up, while clawing again and again at the skin around her eyes. She started to scream when strips of skin peeled off of her face, but she didn\u0027t stop gouging with her nails at her cheeks and forehead-if anything, her clawing grew more urgent. She was going to tear off her own face, piece by piece. Caxton was watching a new half-dead be born, a replacement for the one Reyes had destroyed and thrown in the fire. Reyes felt her disgust. The vampire turned to look at Caxton and for a long bad moment they just stared into each others\u0027 eyes. Caxton felt him squirming around inside of her head, almost as if he were rifling through the filing cabinets of her mind, looking for something and not finding it. The vampire was upset, angry, nervous-though as soon as she sensed those emotions in him he clamped down hard on the psychic connection they shared. Her body writhed as if she were touching a live wire. He looked away and Caxton\u0027s body collapsed backward onto the carts, her breath heaving in and out of her lungs. Her eyes fluttered closed and- -she was back in the burning mill, still clinging to the chain. She could hardly believe she hadn\u0027t let go yet. She wanted it, suddenly, wanted it very badly. She could visualize the whole process. Her body would fall for a few seconds through empty space. She would collide with the surface of the molten metal below. Her skin would burn off instantly, she thought. Her muscles and her flesh would take a moment longer. There would be pain. She was sure it would hurt beyond anything she had ever experienced. But only for a second. And then... what? Oblivion? Nothingness? How tempting it was-how tempting to put everything behind her. She thought of her life even before she was imprisoned in the casket and how much of it had been utter misery. Working so hard for the approval of her superiors, the approval of Arkeley, the approval of her dead father. None of them had ever taken her seriously. Then there was Deanna, Deanna who she loved so much, Deanna who was fading away while she watched. Deanna who had been vibrant and lively and sexy before, and now half the time she couldn\u0027t get off the couch, Caxton would come home and find her there, wrapped up in a quilt, watching some celebrity gossip show on television. Or rather watching empty space, her eyes not even focused on the TV. Caxton had vowed to save Deanna, to bring her back to life. But she was failing, she knew. If anything, Deanna was dragging her down. The dogs-the greyhounds, her beautiful animals. They would miss her. They would howl for her, she knew. But somebody else would come along and feed them, and pet them, and soon enough they would forget. The whole world would forget Laura Caxton after a short season of formulaic grief. If she just ceased to exist, nothing, really, would change. Or rather, one thing would change. In the great balance sheet a certain amount of pain would be subtracted from the world. Wasn\u0027t that a good thing? If she had the opportunity to reduce the world\u0027s pain, by ending her own, wasn\u0027t that the right thing to do? All she had to do was let go. She took one hand off the chain, and somewhere, somewhere outside of the dream, she felt Reyes the vampire start to smile. She looked at her hand. He wanted her to let go. Reyes wanted her to end the dream. It didn\u0027t matter, she told herself. It didn\u0027t matter who wanted what. In a second she would be gone, erased from the world, and after that, who cared? Who cared if the vampires ate half of Pennsylvania? Who cared? She wouldn\u0027t be around to feel guilty. She removed her other hand from the chain. The muscles in her thighs quivered when they were forced to support her whole weight. She started to lean back. So easy. So easy, and it would solve every problem she\u0027d ever had. Strong fingers clutched at her left wrist. She screamed, expecting pain, but the fingers just held her, they didn\u0027t dig into her flesh. They wouldn\u0027t let her fall. She tried to turn her head and see who was holding her but it didn\u0027t work-her neck didn\u0027t bend that way. She couldn\u0027t see the fingers as they shifted their grip, closing like a pair of handcuffs around her wrist. \"You\u0027re not done yet,\" the owner of the fingers said. The voice was quite soft and almost vanished in the furnace roar of the burning mill. She could tell, though, that the voice belonged to Arkeley.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/13-bullets-laura-caxton-vampires-1/page-39.html","bookId":2605,"book":{"id":2605,"title":"13 Bullets (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1)","description":"Storyline: 13 Bullets: A Vampire Tale (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1) Thirteen Bullets takes place in Pennsylvania in the year 2003, in a setting similar to the real world, but where vampires and other supernatural forces are rare but accepted phenomena.
