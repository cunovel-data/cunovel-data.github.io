The two men turned toward the open barn door to leave but she stood rooted to the spot. Caxton felt rage bubble and spit in her stomach. \"Hold on,\" she said, and surprisingly enough they both stopped. \"That was my father. You have my father\u0027s ghost hanging on a rack.\" She had no idea how it had happened, no idea at all why her father\u0027s ghost in particular was in the barn but she wasn\u0027t taking another step until she\u0027d figured it out.\n \"Well now ghosts, them\u0027s tricky, ahum.\" Polder scratched his chin with his wooden hand. \"It don\u0027t really come down to that.\"\n She shook her head angrily. \"I know his voice. I saw his eyes.\"\n \"Yes,\" Arkeley said. \"It might even have been him. His spirit, anyway-or it could have been any kind of mischievous spook who wanted to toy with you. It might not even have been a human apparition. But whoever it was isn\u0027t trapped here in one of these pelts. The teleplasms aren\u0027t ghosts themselves. They\u0027re more like clothing he can pick up and put on. It\u0027s a substance that occupies this world and the other simultaneously, that\u0027s all.\"\n She nodded at Arkeley. \"I can guess what this was all about, though I\u0027m pissed off at you all the same. If the teleplasm reacts strongly to me, that means I\u0027m somehow open to psychic phenomenon. I\u0027m a sensitive.\"\n \"Young lady, based on what we just saw I think you could moonlight as a medium. Please, we need to go inside the house. Your visit with your father made a lot of noise in the spirit world. Anyone who was listening would have heard it-and they might come looking for you.\"\n As they pushed her toward the house she said, \"So if I\u0027m sensitive to ghosts I\u0027m also sensitive to vampires. This explains how the vampire was able to hypnotize me so effortlessly last night.\"\n Arkeley confirmed it. \"I was surprised how little resistance you had. So I brought you here where we can do something about it.\"\n Polder stood before the hex sign over his front door and waved his arm at it, his real arm. He drew a complicated pattern on his forehead with his thumb and something invisible relaxed. Caxton could feel the hex sign let go.\n \"Urie is a hexenmeister. I imagine you know the term?\"\n \"Mostly where I grew up we called them pow-wow doctors, because they were supposed to have all kinds of secret Indian magic.\" Caxton had never taken the old stories that seriously but then she\u0027d never really believed in vampires either. After her adventures of the previous night and what she\u0027d seen in the barn she was willing to suspend a little skepticism.\n They headed inside the house where a woman waited for them. She wore a long black dress with a tight collar around her throat. Her blonde hair stood out from her head in enormous frizzy waves. Her long white fingers were covered in dozens of identical gold rings. \"Vesta, it\u0027s been too long,\" Arkeley said, and he kissed her cheek. The woman\u0027s eyes never moved from Caxton\u0027s face.\n \"I\u0027ve got water on for tea. Darjeeling, just as you like it,\" she said. \"With sugar, not honey, and a touch of milk. Please, don\u0027t be surprised, Laura Beth Caxton. I know a large number of things about you already. I intend to learn many more.\"\n Caxton didn\u0027t even open her mouth. She turned her head because she\u0027d seen a flash of yellow out of the corner of her eye. It was the girl she\u0027d seen in the window, and she vanished as quickly as she had before.\n \"Now you, Special Deputy, you should be kinder to this one. She\u0027s risking much to help you in your vicious crusade.\"\n Arkeley almost hung his head.\n \"Don\u0027t look so glum. I have a little something for your wife\u0027s foot, here,\" Vesta said, and handed the Fed a plastic bag full of a reddish, fibrous plant matter. \"Make it into a poultice and have her wear it every night until she feels better.\"\n \"You have a wife?\" Caxton demanded.\n \"I killed a vampire twenty years ago, and another one last night. I had to keep myself busy in the meantime,\" he told her. He thanked Vesta for her remedy and then he and Urie Polder went deeper into the house. Caxton was not invited. Instead Vesta Polder lead her into a sitting room, a dark but tidy space with a raging fire place and a lot of heavy, dark, wood furniture. Six straight-backed chairs stood against the wall. A round table with a velvet cloth sat in the middle of the room, a horsehair-stuffed armchair crouching behind it. Vesta took this chair, lounging across it with one leg hooked over an arm. Caxton stood before the table for a long while before she thought to take one of the chairs from the wall and put it across the table from Vesta.\n On the table sat the teapot and a single tea cup as well as a large, carved wooden box with a Chinese dragon on its lid and a slim deck of cards. \"You\u0027ve seen these before, in a movie,\" she said, tapping the cards against her wrist and then shuffling them one-handed. \"But you don\u0027t know what they\u0027re called. They\u0027re Zener cards.\"\n She fanned a few of them as if she were demonstrating a poker hand. \"They are used by parapsychologists to test extra-sensory perception. They possess other virtues, as well.\" On one side they showed a single symbol in thick black lines: a triangle, a star, a circle, three wavy lines or a square. \"Now,\" she said, \"your instinct is going to be to tell me what you see.\" She cut the cards and held one up so that Caxton could see it-a star.\n \"It\u0027s a star,\" she said.\n \"Yes, dear, I know it is.\" Vesta put the card down on the coffee table and opened the carved box. \"I see all. Now, please. From here on don\u0027t say anything. Don\u0027t try to project, don\u0027t give me any clues. Just look at the cards.\"\n Caxton never touched the tea. One by one Vesta lifted the cards so that only Caxton could see them. After a moment she would put them face down on the table. Occasionally she paused to study Caxton\u0027s face as intently as if she were sketching it. Then she would reach into her Chinese box and take out a long brown cigarette and an equally long match. She would puff at the cigarette, filling the room with pungent, foul smoke until Caxton\u0027s eyes watered. Then she would draw another card. This went on until she ran out of cards: then Vesta would shuffle the cards and start again. With each shuffle there were new instructions. Caxton should try not to look at the card. She should speak the card\u0027s symbol in her mind, rather than visualizing it. She should try to clear her mind of thoughts altogether. Time seemed to slow down, or perhaps stop. Maybe there was something more in the cigarettes than tobacco.\n Vesta gathered up the deck and shuffled it again. \"Alright. This time, try to think of a symbol other than the one you see.\" Caxton nodded and got to it. After they\u0027d gone through five or six cards, Vesta surprised her. \"You\u0027re worried about Deanna.\"\n It was hard to concentrate on the card in front of her but Vesta rattled it between two fingers and she looked away from the other woman\u0027s face. \"She\u0027s been out of work for a long time.\"\n \"She\u0027s been having bad dreams. Violent dreams-you had to wake her up last night because you were scared she would hurt herself. She\u0027s scared too, scared that you\u0027ll be killed.\"\n That makes two of us, Caxton thought.\n \"Focus on the card in your head, even when you look at the card in my hand. She is afraid of the future, it sounds like to me. Afraid because she does not know if you will let her stay with you. Yet you have never even considered asking her to leave.\"\n Caxton bit her lip. It was hard to even see the card in Vesta\u0027s hand when she thought of Deanna. \"You can read her mind, too? But she\u0027s fifty miles from here.\"\n Vesta sighed. She put down the cards and took another cigarette out of her box. It was her fifth so far. \"I see the portion of her that exists within you.\" She scattered the cards on the table. \"This is hopeless. Some people grasp the technique in a moment, while others need additional help. Given enough time, enough sessions I might teach you some rudiments of psychic self defense. For now, this must do.\"\n She opened her box again and took out a brass charm on a black cord. \"Wear it always, and try not to make eye contact with anyone who might harm you.\"\n Caxton took the pendant from Vesta and slipped it around her neck. The charm was a tightly-wound spiral that she could pass off as jewelry. Caxton was glad for it-she had half expected a pentacle or a gruesome crucifix.\n \"Those wouldn\u0027t work for you. Their power requires faith which you do not possess.\"\n Caxton touched the cool metal at her throat. Deanna. Now that she was thinking about Deanna she couldn\u0027t stop. \"It\u0027s not just a question of not kicking her out. I don\u0027t want to lose her the way I lost my mother.\"\n Vesta stared at her and said nothing. It was as if she expected Caxton to tell her all about the sad, sorry tale of her mother\u0027s insanity, the depression that had struck her after her husband\u0027s death, her eventual suicide.\n \"She hanged herself,\" Caxton said, finally, blushing. \"In her bedroom. A neighbor found her and cut her down and tried to make her look presentable. My mother had always been very proud of her looks. When I got there she was laid out on the bed and her hair had been brushed and someone had even put some make-up on her. But they couldn\u0027t hide the rope burn all the way around her neck.\"\n Vesta nodded and exhaled a plume of smoke. \"You worry about losing Deanna, well, that\u0027s just natural. But when the time comes you\u0027ll be ready to let her go. You\u0027ll have to be. I see it as strongly as I see the waves in your mind\u0027s eye.\"\n That last bit confused Caxton-until she finally looked at the card in Vesta\u0027s hand. It showed three wavy lines.\n \"Now, come, let\u0027s collect the boys.\" They rose and headed into the kitchen, where Arkeley and Urie sat around an enormous table that had once been a door and now was mounted on plain wooden trestles. They had between them a pile of small objects, triangular in shape and almost pearlescent in color. Caxton picked one up and saw it was a vampire\u0027s tooth. After killing the vampire the night before the Fed must have pulled out all his teeth with a pair of pliers.\n Urie Polder swept the teeth into a satin bag and tied it closed with a thong. \"Now that\u0027ll do just fine, in way of payment, ahum.\"\n \"What are you going to do with those?\" Caxton asked.\n \"He\u0027ll find something they\u0027re useful for,\" Vesta told her, ushering her toward the front door. \"Waste not, want not.\"\n As they drove away the little blonde girl watched them from the window. Caxton had never gotten to meet her, and didn\u0027t even know her name. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/13-bullets-laura-caxton-vampires-1/page-17.html","bookId":2605,"book":{"id":2605,"title":"13 Bullets (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1)","description":"Storyline: \n 13 Bullets: A Vampire Tale (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1) \n Thirteen Bullets takes place in Pennsylvania in the year 2003, in a setting similar to the real world, but where vampires and other supernatural forces are rare but accepted phenomena.
