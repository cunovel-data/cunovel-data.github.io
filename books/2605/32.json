One of the guys from the Area Response Team had to pull it tight behind her back and buckle it there. He also helped her with the knee, shin, and shoulder guards. She figured out the helmet for herself. \"Larry Reynolds,\" he told her, and stuck out a gloved hand. She shook it and introduced herself.\n \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m so unfamiliar with this stuff. This is my first time in riot gear.\" She squirmed for a moment, embarrassed, then admitted, \"normally I\u0027m highway patrol.\"\n \"You were in on that vampire kill a couple of nights ago, right? That\u0027s what they told us when we got assigned to this detail.\" Reynolds had black paint under his eyes and it made it hard to read his expression. She couldn\u0027t tell if he was annoyed to be saddled with such an untrained whelp as herself and was hiding it well or if he was honestly trying to be friendly. \"Stick with us, keep your head down, and you\u0027ll be alright.\"\n Another ART Detective came up and slapped Reynolds on the top of his helmet.\n \"Keeping his head down is about ninety per cent of Larry\u0027s job.\" Reynolds faked punching the new guy in the kidney and they broke away, laughing, dancing around each other like Caxton\u0027s greyhounds. \"I\u0027m DeForrest, and I\u0027ll be your stewardess this morning,\" the new guy told her. He had Reynolds in a headlock. \"We hope you enjoy your trip with Granola Roller airlines.\"\n Caxton had no idea what he was talking about but she smiled anyway. It had taken a lot of pleading to get assigned to this detail and she didn\u0027t want the ART\n guys to resent her presence. When a woman in riot gear came and offered her coffee from a thermos she took it as graciously as she could.\n Truth be told, she needed the caffeine as much as she needed to be accepted. She hadn\u0027t slept, even for a moment, not since she\u0027d woken up the day before and realized why the vampires had decimated Bitumen Hollow. Her hands were shaking and if she looked at anything too closely or for too long its outlines grew fuzzy and indistinct.\n \"They\u0027re infantile, I know, but they\u0027re good men,\" the woman with the coffee said. \"DeForrest was a firefighter before he took this job. He was bored, he said. I assumed the first time I met him that he just wanted to play with guns, like a lot of people who sign up for the ART. He\u0027s never discharged his weapon, not once, since he came to work with us, even when bad guys have fired on him. Reynolds dislocated his shoulder last year getting a five-year-old out of a trailer knocked over in a tornado.\"\n \"Wow,\" Caxton said.\n \"I\u0027m Suzie Jesuroga. Captain Suzie,\" the woman said, and shook Caxton\u0027s hand.\n \"Laura Caxton. Trooper.\"\n Captain Suzie smiled. \"I know exactly who you are. We\u0027ve all been briefed about that vampire kill you pulled off over on Route 322. The Commissioner made us go over all the details. Today\u0027s trip should be a little less hairy, considering we\u0027ve got good daylight conditions and the extra precautions we\u0027re taking, but I\u0027m still glad to have you along. You want to get started?\"\n The four of them finished suiting up and ran through an equipment and weapons check. They\u0027d been issued M4 carbines, military-grade assault rifles with underslung shotgun attachments. Caxton also carried her Beretta, loaded up with cross points. The others had their own personal weapons-combat knives, revolvers, tear gas and smoke grenades. The ART had a little latitude, it seemed, in how they kitted out for an operation. Together they headed up, out of the locker room of the Harrisburg HQ\n and down to a parking lot secluded by a line of trees. Darkness tinged the deep, rich blue of an impending dawn lay over the lot like a comforter. Arkeley waited for them there, wearing no protective gear at all, just his overcoat. It hung open and she could tell he wasn\u0027t carrying anything other than his Glock 23 with its thirteen bullets.\n \"Captain,\" he said, when they greeted him, \"I\u0027ll express one more time my desire to leave this vehicle behind.\" He nodded his chin at a giant white truck that took up two spaces in the parking lot. It was based on the chassis of a Humvee, Caxton thought, but it had been uparmored as if it were meant to roll through Tikrit instead of Scranton. Heavy metal plates had been welded to its doors, its hood, its roof, and all of the windows had been almost completely obscured except for small slits. Even the truck\u0027s tires had been reinforced with heavy chains. What looked like a home-made air cannon had been mounted on the roof.\n \"It\u0027s pretty noisy when it gets up to speed, I\u0027ll admit,\" Captain Suzie told Arkeley. \"Are you afraid we\u0027ll wake the vampires?\"\n Arkeley\u0027s upper lip twitched in distaste. \"No. Vampires don\u0027t sleep during the day. They literally die anew every morning. It\u0027s the half-deads I\u0027m worried about.\"\n Captain Suzie just shrugged. \"The Commissioner gave me my orders himself. You can talk to him if you want to change the plan, but he doesn\u0027t even come in to the office until nine. I\u0027d just as soon get on the road now.\"\n Arkeley narrowed his eyes but he nodded and stalked off toward his own car, an unmarked patrol car that looked puny by comparison.\n One by one the ART climbed inside the armored vehicle. The interior was packed with so much gear and the Team members were so bulky in their riot armor that there was barely room for the four of them. Reynolds drove and DeForrest took shotgun-almost literally, since he rode with his weapon in his hands. Captain Suzie rode beside Caxton in the back seat.\n A man came out of the main building, his uniform shirt unbuttoned and his face unshaven. Caxton recognized the Range Officer from the less-lethal weapons test area, the one who had supplied her with her cross points. He popped open the hood of the armored vehicle and played around with the engine for a minute.\n \"It\u0027s the old man\u0027s baby, and he never lets it out without a personal inspection,\"\n DeForrest told Caxton, craning around in his seat to look at her, his helmet catching on the headrest of his seat and tilting over one eye. \"He built the Granola Roller nearly from scratch.\"\n \"I\u0027m guessing I\u0027m sitting in the very same Granola Roller,\" Caxton said. Reynolds snorted. \"Yeah. It was never really meant for hunting vampire. The old man designed it for crowd control, you know, at demonstrations and protests and riots and such. Sometimes we call it \u0027Extra Chunky,\u0027 too.\"\n Caxton tried to figure it out but her fatigued brain couldn\u0027t make sense of the name. \"Why\u0027s that?\" she finally asked.\n \"Because,\" DeForrest said, barely able to contain his mirth, \"when you run over a hippy with this thing, extra chunky is about all that\u0027s left.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be gross,\" Captain Suzie said as DeForrest and Reynolds laughed in each other\u0027s faces. She turned to Caxton. \"I\u0027m sure that I\u0027ll have to do this about a hundred times today, but now, for the first time, I officially apologize for my men. Reynolds, have you forgotten how to drive a stick shift or are we waiting for the vampire to die of old age? Let\u0027s get moving!\"\n \"Yes, Ma\u0027am,\" Reynolds said, and he started up the armored vehicle with a noise like boulders falling down a mountainside. The Range Officer waved them off and started buttoning his shirt.\n They followed Arkeley\u0027s car onto the highway and settled in for the long ride to Kennett Square, which was all the way down by the border with Delaware. The armored vehicle\u0027s groaning and grunting engine noise made it impossible to speak and be heard inside the cabin but Caxton didn\u0027t mind so much. She could barely form a coherent sentence in her head, much less make one come out of her mouth. She had to hunch over against the door to look out the view-slit in her window, which meant exposing her bones to a constant jouncing vibration as the heavy truck ground over every minor imperfection in the roadway. Somehow she survived, though. She watched suburban lawns speed by, silver with frost and dark with fallen leaves. As they rolled out into more rural zones she let her eyes linger on the geometric regularity of farmers\u0027 fields or the shaking, surging rattle of dark tree branches that leaned close over the road.\n Every time she closed her eyes she saw a death\u0027s head, and felt wriggling finger bones rattling in her hands. She saw Deanna covered in blood. She remembered what it was like to be hypnotized by a vampire, to feel as if she were drowning in death, as if the air had turned to glass and she were suspended inside of it. She reached up and touched Vesta Polder\u0027s amulet through the thick layers of nylon and kevlar of her ballistic vest.\n As the sun began to climb up from behind the ridges, a lemon-colored sliver on the horizon, she began to feel a little better. She was taking action, taking up arms against the thing that was trying to kill her, which had nearly killed Deanna. Arkeley, when he heard she had requested to come along on this raid, had said absolutely not. While he had never expressly forbidden her he had thought, he told her, that he had made himself quite clear. He didn\u0027t want her endangered. He didn\u0027t think she could handle it.\n She had told him about torturing a half-dead, how she had pulled the bastard\u0027s fingers off, and slowly, almost imperceptibly, he had come around. He\u0027d never actually said it was alright, but he had stopped insisting she stay behind quite so strongly. It was as good as she was going to get, she knew. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/13-bullets-laura-caxton-vampires-1/page-32.html","bookId":2605,"book":{"id":2605,"title":"13 Bullets (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1)","description":"Storyline: \n 13 Bullets: A Vampire Tale (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1) \n Thirteen Bullets takes place in Pennsylvania in the year 2003, in a setting similar to the real world, but where vampires and other supernatural forces are rare but accepted phenomena.
