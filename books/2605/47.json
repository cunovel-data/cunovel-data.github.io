{"id":98038,"no":47,"title":"Page 47","content":"Caxton sat in the morgue next to Deanna\u0027s body on a gurney. Dr. Prabinder and Clara were nowhere to be seen. She was all alone in the semi-darkened room, surrounded on every side by rolling partitions. How she\u0027d gotten there she couldn\u0027t say. It was like she had blacked out, except she hadn\u0027t, at all. The trip from the fourth floor down to the basement was all there in her memory. It was just so immaterial she hadn\u0027t bothered to review the information.\\n\\n There had been a complication, she remembered. She got up and walked around the gurney. She touched Deanna here and there. Twitched back the sheet that covered her. Deanna\u0027s face was calm, at least. Her eyes closed, her red hair clean. Her lips were pale but otherwise she didn\u0027t look so bad. Caxton moved the sheet back a little more, though, and wished she hadn\u0027t. Deanna\u0027s breasts pointed in the wrong directions. Her chest was open like a ravenous mouth, her ribs like teeth reaching for a piece of meat. Her lungs and her heart lay collapsed at the bottom of that wound like a lolling tongue.\\n\\n There had been a complication. Deanna had lost so much blood when she broke the kitchen window that she had required five new units of blood, most of it in the form of plasma. They had given her some whole blood because she had started to show the signs of acute anemia-coldness in the extremities even while her trunk was warm, a lasting and dangerous shortness of breath.\\n\\n There had been a complication. A blood clot had formed, perhaps from one of her wounds, possibly from a bad reaction to the transfused blood. Dr. Prabinder had refused to speculate. The clot had entered Deanna\u0027s blood stream and probably roamed around her body several times before it reached her left lung. There had been a complication. A pulmonary embolus, Dr. Prabinder had called it. When it was detected they had rushed her immediately into surgery, of course. They had tried to cut it out. And that was one complication too many.\\n\\n \"I really must insist, Ms. Caxton,\" the doctor said, pulling one of the partitions back. \"You\u0027re not supposed to be here at all, and truly, it\u0027s not appropriate for the morgue technicians to let you see her in this condition-\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Trooper Caxton,\" Clara announced. She held up her badge.\\n\\n \"Oh, I... I didn\u0027t know,\" Doctor Prabinder said.\\n\\n \"This is a homicide investigation, Doctor.\" Clara put her badge away. What she was doing was highly illegal. She was well outside of her jurisdiction. So was Caxton. Lying about a criminal investigation could get them put away for years. Caxton wouldn\u0027t tell, if Clara didn\u0027t. She pulled the sheet back up over Deanna\u0027s chest. Blood soaked through it almost instantly.\\n\\n \"When?\" Caxton asked. She couldn\u0027t get any more of the sentence out.\\n\\n \"What was the official time of death?\" Clara asked.\\n\\n The doctor checked his PDA. \"Last night, about four fifteen.\"\\n\\n \"Before dawn,\" Caxton said. While she had been fighting vampires in abandoned steel mills Deanna had been slowly dying and nobody had known. There would have been nobody with her. Perhaps if there had been it could have been avoided. Perhaps if Caxton had been there, listening to Deanna\u0027s ragged breathing, she might have noticed some change. She could have summoned the doctor. They could have gotten Deanna into surgery that much quicker.\\n\\n At the very least she could have held her hand. \"I wasn\u0027t here,\" she said.\\n\\n \"No, no, come on,\" Clara said.\\n\\n \"Ah, ladies, I know it is not my place to ask, but is it acceptable for this woman to investigate the death of someone so close? Is there not a conflict of interest?\"\\n\\n \"She was alone,\" Caxton said, ignoring him.\\n\\n \"Was there anyone in her room last night? Any visitors at all?\"\\n\\n The doctor shook his head in incomprehension. \"No, of course not. We don\u0027t let visitors in after seven and anyway she had posted a guard on the room.\" He pointed at Caxton with his PDA. \"Did you not know about the guard?\"\\n\\n Clara glanced at her, then back at the doctor. \"I was just brought in on this case. I\u0027m still catching up.\"\\n\\n \"I... see.\" Doctor Prabinder straightened up and squared his shoulders. \"Now let\u0027s get one thing clear. I wish to assist the police in any manner possible, of course. But this is my hospital, and-\"\\n\\n \"Doctor,\" Caxton said, turning to face him for the first time. She gave him her best fisheye look. Caxton wasn\u0027t wearing her uniform, she didn\u0027t have a badge, and her weapon was still in the trunk of Clara\u0027s Volkswagen. It didn\u0027t matter. The look was what made you a cop. That perfectly uncaring, potentially violent look that could freeze most people in their tracks. \"I need to know if anything unusual happened here last night. I need to know if anybody saw or heard anything weird or out of place. Anything at all.\"\\n\\n \"Of course, of course,\" he said. He looked down at his shoes. \"But this is a hospital with a trauma ward in a major urban center. You must clarify for me, I have seen so many weird things...\" He just sort of trailed off.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not talking about freak accidents. I\u0027m talking about people with no faces being seen in the hallways. I\u0027m talking about vampire activity.\"\\n\\n \"Vampires, here?\" He muttered something in Hindi that sounded like a brief prayer. \"I saw on the news that-I hear some things, yes, and the bodies that came in-but oh, my, no, nothing like that last night! I swear it.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\" Caxton reached down and took Deanna\u0027s hand. It was freezing cold but then so was hers. \"Now I need someone to sew this woman up so I can bury her. Can you arrange that?\"\\n\\n Dr. Prabinder nodded and took out his cell phone. \"There will be papers to sign, of course, if that is not too much.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Caxton said. She took out her own phone. Deanna\u0027s brother Elvin was in her stored phonebook. Hopefully he would know his-and Dee\u0027s-mother\u0027s number. There were suddenly a lot of things she needed to do.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so, so sorry,\" Clara said, and reached for her, but Caxton shrugged her away.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t feel anything right now,\" Caxton tried to explain. She didn\u0027t know if the grief was just too big and she was defending herself from it or if Reyes was in control of her emotions. To him Deanna\u0027s death was only regrettable in that all that blood was going to waste.\\n\\n It helped. There were a lot of phone calls to make and a lot of questions to answer. Somebody had to be calm and in charge.\\n\\n Elvin wasn\u0027t home. She left a message for him to call her back. Someone came and asked her about organ donation. She told them to take what they could. Deanna was wrapped up, taken away. They brought her back-her tissues weren\u0027t good candidates for donation. She\u0027d been dead too long for the major organs to be useful and her skin and eyes weren\u0027t the right type. Caxton called Elvin again. Someone from the transplant center came down and demanded to know who she thought she was, offering up Deanna\u0027s body parts for donation, when she wasn\u0027t even a relative. That conversation took far too long. For perhaps the first time she actually wished she\u0027d bothered to get a civil union. It wouldn\u0027t have given her any more rights but it might have forestalled a few of the less comfortable questions. She finally got hold of Elvin and he said he would come right away. He would bring Deanna\u0027s mother. Caxton flipped shut her phone and put it away. She turned around and there was Clara.\\n\\n \"How long have I been making phone calls?\" she asked. She had a feeling a lot more time had passed than she was aware of. She was in a lounge, for one thing. Hadn\u0027t she just been in the morgue? Somehow she\u0027d been moved to a well-heated lounge with a big window and comfortable chairs and lots of tattered magazines. Maybe Clara had brought her there.\\n\\n \"Well, I already went and had lunch. I got you a sandwich.\"\\n\\n Caxton took the offered bag and opened it up. Tuna salad, white flesh in white mayonnaise on white bread. It didn\u0027t appeal to her at all. She wanted roast beef and felt almost childishly peevish about it-why couldn\u0027t Clara have gotten her roast beef? Why couldn\u0027t she go right now and get a big rare steak, all full of juice, of, of-of blood?\\n\\n She clamped down on that thought immediately and started eating the tuna sandwich. She was not going to let the vampire live vicariously through her.\\n\\n \"Listen, there\u0027s something I haven\u0027t heard anyone mention, but I think it\u0027s important,\" Clara said. She frowned and pursed her lips and finally spat it out. \"Do we need,\" she said, pronouncing each word separately, \"to consider, well, cremation.\"\\n\\n Caxton blinked rapidly. \"You mean for Deanna?\" she asked. \"Of course you do. I mean, nobody else is dead right now. Yeah. Right. Cremation.\" She didn\u0027t so much think it through as let it come bubbling up in her head. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Clara repeated, tentatively.\\n\\n \"No. You saw all that blood. No vampire would leave so much blood on a body. It was just an accident, Clara. Just a stupid fucked-up accident, the kind that still happens, you know? Not everybody gets killed by monsters.\"\\n\\n Clara nodded supportively, then opened her mouth to speak again. She stopped when the door behind her burst open. An enormous man with thin, straight red hair that fell past his shoulders came storming in. He wore a sheepskin coat and a look of absolute befuddlement. Behind him followed a woman with hair dyed to match his though it showed grey at the roots. Her face was a mess of red blotches as if she\u0027d been crying, or drinking. Most likely both, Caxton knew.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s this, your new girlfriend?\" Deanna\u0027s mother asked.\\n\\n \"Hello, Roxie,\" Caxton tried. She glanced up at the big redheaded man and her heart beat for the first time in hours. \"Oh, Elvin, I\u0027m so sorry.\"\\n\\n He nodded his massive head. \"Yeah. Thanks. Thanks a lot,\" he said. He looked around as if unsure of where he was.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to go now,\" Clara said.\\n\\n \"Jesus, don\u0027t leave on my account.\" Roxie Purfleet sneered at Caxton. \"You work fast, huh? One of them\u0027s not even cold and you\u0027re on to the next.\"\\n\\n Clara slipped past her without further comment. Caxton sat the Purfleets down and started to explain what had happened. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/13-bullets-laura-caxton-vampires-1/page-47.html","bookId":2605,"book":{"id":2605,"title":"13 Bullets (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1)","description":"Storyline: 13 Bullets: A Vampire Tale (Laura Caxton / Vampires #1) \\n Thirteen Bullets takes place in Pennsylvania in the year 2003, in a setting similar to the real world, but where vampires and other supernatural forces are rare but accepted phenomena.
