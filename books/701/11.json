{"id":37990,"no":11,"title":"Section 11","content":"Again Peter did not know how long he lay shivering in the black dungeon. He only knew that they brought him bread and water three times, before Guffey came again and summoned him forth. Peter now sat huddled into a chair, twisting his trembling hands together, while the chief detective of the Traction Trust explained to him his new program. Peter was permanently ruined as a witness in the case. The labor conspirators had raised huge sums for their defense; they had all the labor unions of the city, and in fact of the entire country behind them, and they were hiring spies and informers, and trying to find out all they could about the prosecution, the evidence it had collected and the moves it was preparing. Guffey did not say that he had been afraid to kick Peter out because of the possibility that Peter might go over to the Goober side and tell all he knew; but Peter guessed this while he sat listening to Guffey’s explanation, and realized with a thrill of excitement that at last he had really got a hold upon the ladder of prosperity. Not in vain had his finger been almost broken and his wrist almost dislocated! “Now,” said Guffey, “here’s my idea: As a witness you’re on the bum, but as a spy, you’re it. They know that you blabbed, and that I know it; they know I’ve had you in the hole. So now what I want to do is to make a martyr of you. D’you see?” Peter nodded; yes, he saw. It was his specialty, seeing things like that. “You’re an honest witness, you understand? I tried to get you to lie, and you wouldn’t, so now you go over to the other side, and they take you in, and you find out all you can, and from time to time you meet somebody as I’ll arrange it, and send me word what you’ve learned. You get me?” “I get you,” said Peter, eagerly. No words could portray his relief. He had a real job now! He was going to be a sleuth, like Guffey himself. “Now,” said Guffey, “the first thing I want to know is, who’s blabbing in this jail; we can’t do anything but they get tipped off. I’ve got witnesses that I want kept hidden, and I don’t dare put them here for fear of the Goober crowd. I want to know who are the traitors. I want to know a lot of things that I’ll tell you from time to time. I want you to get next to these Reds, and learn about their ideas, so you can talk their lingo. “Sure,” said Peter. He could not help smiling a little. He was supposed to be a “Red” already, to have been one of their leading conspirators. But Guffey had abandoned that pretence—or perhaps had forgotten about it! It was really an easy job that Peter had set before him. He did not have to pretend to be anything different from what he was. He would call himself a victim of circumstances, and would be honestly indignant against those who had sought to use him in a frame-up against Jim Goober. The rest would follow naturally. He would get the confidence of the labor people, and Guffey would tell him what to do next. “We’ll put you in one of the cells of this jail,” said the chief detective, “and we’ll pretend to give you a ‘third degree.’ You’ll holler and make a fuss, and say you won’t tell, and finally we’ll give up and kick you out. And then all you have to do is just hang around. They’ll come after you, or I miss my guess.” So the little comedy was arranged and played thru. Guffey took Peter by the collar and led him out into the main part of the jail, and locked him in one of a row of open cells. He grabbed Peter by the wrist and pretended to twist it, and Peter pretended to protest. He did not have to draw on his imagination; he knew how it felt, and how he was supposed to act, and he acted. He sobbed and screamed, and again and again he vowed that he had told the truth, that he knew nothing else than what he had told, and that nothing could make him tell any more. Guffey left him there until late the next afternoon, and then came again, and took him by the collar, and led him out to the steps of the jail, and gave him a parting kick. Peter was free! What a wonderful sensation—freedom! God! Had there ever been anything like it? He wanted to shout and howl with joy. But instead he staggered along the street, and sank down upon a stone coping, sobbing, with his head clasped in his hands, waiting for something to happen. And sure enough, it happened. Perhaps an hour passed, when he was touched lightly on the shoulder. “Comrade,” said a soft voice, and Peter, looking between his fingers, saw the skirts of a girl. A folded slip of paper was pressed into his hand and the soft voice said: “Come to this address.” The girl walked on, and Peter’s heart leaped with excitement. Peter was a sleuth at last! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3225/87997.html","bookId":701,"book":{"id":701,"title":"100%: The Story of a Patriot","description":"简介： Now and then it occurs to one to reflect upon what slender threads of accident depend the most important circumstances of his life; to look back and shudder, realizing how close to the edge of nothingness his being has come.
