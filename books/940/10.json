{"id":16475,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 9: The Capture Of The Lido.","content":"Signor Polani told Francis, that evening, that he was much pleased with the report that the captain had given of his eagerness to acquire information both in mercantile and nautical matters, and of the manner in which he had kept the ship\u0027s books, and the entries of the sales, and purchases of goods. \"Many young fellows at your age, Francis, when there was no compulsion for them to have taken these matters into their charge, would have thought only of amusement and gaiety when they were in port, and I am glad to see that you have a real interest in them. Whatever the line in life a young man takes up, he will never excel in it unless he goes into it with all his heart, and I am very glad to see that you have thrown yourself so heartily into your new profession. The Bonito made a most satisfactory voyage, far more so than I anticipated, when I found that she would not be able to carry out the programme I had laid down for her; but the rise in the prices in the latter part of your voyage have more than made up for the loss of the trade in the Black Sea; and you have done as much in the three months you were absent, as I should have expected had you been, as I anticipated, six months away. \"You will be some little time before you start again, as I wish to see how matters are going before I send the Bonito out upon another adventure. At present nothing is settled here. That there will be war with Genoa before long is certain, but we would rather postpone it as long as possible, and the senate has not yet arrived at the decision to accept the offer of Tenedos. Negotiations are going on with Genoa and Constantinople, but I have little hope that anything will come of them. \"It is getting late in the season now, and the war will hardly break out until next spring; but I have no doubt the struggle will then begin, and preparations are going on with all speed in the dockyards. We are endeavouring to obtain allies, but the combination is so strong against Venice that we are meeting with little success, and Ferrara is really the only friend on whom we can rely, and she is not in a position to aid us materially, in such a struggle as this will be. \"I am glad to tell you that the affair in which you were concerned, before you sailed, has now completely dropped. Nothing has been heard of Mocenigo since he made his escape. \"A decree of banishment was passed against him, but where he is we know not. That wretched woman was sentenced to four years\u0027 imprisonment, but upon my petition she will be released at the end of six months, on her promise that she will not again set foot in the territory of the republic. As Mocenigo has not been brought to trial, there will be no further official inquiry into the matter, and I have not been further questioned as to the source from which I obtained my information as to the girls\u0027 hiding place. Your share in the matter is therefore altogether unsuspected, and I do not think that there is any further danger to you from Mocenigo\u0027s partisans.\" \"I should be glad enough to remain in Venice a fortnight or so, sir,\" Francis said. \"But if, at the end of that time, you have any vessel going out, I shall prefer to go in her. Now that my studies are over, I shall very soon get tired of doing nothing. Perhaps in a few years I may care more for the gaieties of Venice, but certainly at present I have no interest in them, and would rather be at sea. Matteo tells me that you have promised he shall make a few voyages in your ships, and that you have told him he shall go in one of them shortly. If so, it would be very pleasant to us both if we can sail together.\" \"I will arrange it so, Francisco. It would be for the benefit of my cousin--who is a good lad, but harebrained, and without ballast--for you to go with him. I should indeed have proposed it, but the vessel in which I have decided he shall sail will be ready for sea in another ten days or so, and I thought that you would prefer a longer stay in Venice before you again set sail. If, however, it is your wish to be off again so soon, I will arrange for you both to sail together. \"This time you will go officially as my supercargo, since you now understand the duties. The captain of the vessel in which you will sail is a good sailor and a brave man, but he has no aptitude for trade, and I must have sent a supercargo with him. Your decision to go relieves me of this, for which I am not sorry, for men who are at once good supercargos, and honest men, are difficult to get.\" The fortnight passed rapidly, and Francis enjoyed his stay at the merchant\u0027s greatly, but he was not sorry when, at the end of ten days, Polani told him that the lading of the vessel would begin the next day, and that he had best go on board early and see the cargo shipped, so that he might check off the bales and casks as they were sent on board, and see where each description of goods was stowed away. \"I think, papa, it is too bad of you, sending Francisco away so soon,\" Maria said, when at their evening meal she learned the news of his early departure. \"It is his own doing,\" her father said. \"It is he who wants to go, not I who send him. I consider that it is entirely your fault.\" \"Our fault!\" the two girls repeated in surprise. \"Certainly. If you had made Venice sufficiently pleasant to him, he would not wish to leave. I am too busy to see about such things, and I left it to you to entertain him. As he is in such a hurry to get away again, it is evident that you have not succeeded in doing so.\" \"Indeed, Signor Polani, your daughters have been everything that is kind, but I have no taste for assemblies and entertainments. I feel out of place there, amid all the gaily dressed nobles and ladies, and no sooner do I get there, than I begin to wonder how anyone can prefer the heated rooms, and clatter of tongues, to the quiet pleasure of a walk backwards and forwards on the deck of a good ship. Besides, I want to learn my profession, and there is so much to learn in it that I feel I have no time to lose.\" \"I am right glad to see your eagerness in that direction, Francisco, and I did but jest with my daughters. You have not yet asked me what is the destination of the Lido, for that is the name of your new vessel. This time you are going quite in a new direction. In the spring we are certain to have war with Genoa, and as Parma and Hungary will probably both take side against us, we may find ourselves cut off from the mainland, and, in case of a disaster happening to our fleet, in sore straits for food. I am, therefore, going to gather into my warehouses as much grain as they will hold. This will both be a benefit to the state, and will bring me good profit, for the price of wheat will be high in the city if we are leaguered on the land side. \"The Lido will go down to Sicily, and fill up there with corn. You will have to use care before entering port, for with war now certain, both parties will begin to snap up prizes when they get the chance. So you must keep a sharp lookout for Genoese galleys. If you find the coast is too closely watched, you will go to the Moorish ports. We are friends with them at present, though doubtless, as soon as Genoa and ourselves get to blows, they will be resuming their piratical work. Thus you will, this time, take in a much smaller amount of cargo, as you will have to pay for the most part in gold.\" It mattered little to Francis where he voyaged; but Matteo, who had been greatly delighted at the thought of sailing with his friend, was much disappointed when he heard that they were only going to fetch grain from Sicily. \"Why, it is nothing to call a voyage,\" he said in tones of disgust, when Francis told him the destination of the Lido. \"I had hoped we were going to make a long voyage, and touch at all sorts of places, just as you did last time.\" \"I do not see that it matters much, Matteo; and we shall learn navigation just as well from one course as another. The voyage will not be a long one, unless we meet with unfavourable winds; but there\u0027s no saying what may happen, and you may meet with adventure, even on a voyage to Sicily and back.\" The trip down to Sicily was quickly made. Francis had worked hard on his first voyage, and was now able to make daily calculations as to the run made, the course steered, and the position of the ship, and found that these tallied closely with those of the captain. Matteo and he shared a large and handsome cabin, and the time passed pleasantly as the vessel ran down the coast of Italy. Once out of the Adriatic a sharp lookout was kept, but the coast of Sicily was made without seeing any sails of a suspicious character. The lads were struck with surprise and admiration when, on coming on deck in the morning, they saw the great cone of Etna lying ahead of them. Neither of them had ever seen a mountain of any size, and their interest in the scene was heightened by a slight wreath of smoke, which curled up from the summit of the hill. \"It is well worth a voyage, if it were only to see that mountain,\" Francis said. \"What an immense height it is, and how regular in its shape!\" \"And yet,\" Matteo said, \"those who have journeyed from Italy into France tell me that there are mountains there beside which Etna is as nothing. These mountains are a continuation of the range of hills which we can see from Venice. Their tops are always covered with snow, and cannot be ascended by man; whereas it is easy, they say, to reach the top of Etna.\" \"Yes, that looks easy enough,\" Francis agreed. \"It seems such a regular slope, that one could almost ride up; but I dare say, when you are close you would find all sorts of difficult places.\" \"I should like to try,\" Matteo said. \"What a grand view there would be from the top! \"Is the port we are going to try first, captain, anywhere near the foot of the mountain?\" \"No, I am going round the southern part of the island. On this side the ground is less fertile, and we should have difficulty in obtaining a cargo. But even were we to put into a port on this side, you would not be able to climb Mount Etna. \"Sicily has been an unfortunate country. Its great natural wealth has rendered it an object of desire, to all its neighbours. It was the battleground of the Romans and Carthaginians. Pisa, Genoa, and Naples have all contended for its possession; and the Moors frequently make descents upon its coasts. It has seldom enjoyed a peaceful and settled government. The consequence is that general lawlessness prevails in the districts remote from the towns; while in the forests that clothe the side of Mount Etna, there are numerous hordes of bandits who set the authorities at defiance, levy blackmail throughout the surrounding villages, and carry off wealthy inhabitants, and put them to ransom. No one in his senses would think of ascending that mountain, unless he had something like an army with him.\" \"I should like to try it, all the same,\" Matteo asserted. \"If there are woods all over it, it is not likely one would happen to meet with any of these people. I should like, above all things, to get to the top of that hill.\" \"It would be harder work than you think, young sir,\" the captain said. \"You have no idea from this distance what the height is, or what a long journey it is to ascend to the top. I have been told that it is a hundred and twenty miles round its foot.\" \"I don\u0027t think you would like it, Matteo, if you were to try it,\" Francis said laughing. \"You know you are as lazy as you can be, and hate exerting yourself. I am sure that, before you got a quarter the distance up that mountain, you would have only one wish, and that would be to be at the bottom again.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Matteo said. \"I hate exerting myself uselessly--wasting my strength, as you do, in rowing at an oar, or anything of that sort; but to do anything great, I would not mind exertion, and would go on until I dropped.\" \"That is all very well, Matteo; but to do anything great, you have got to do small things first. You could never wield a sword for five minutes unless you had practised with it; and you will never succeed in accomplishing any feats requiring great strength and endurance, if you do not practise your muscles on every occasion. You used to grumble at the height when you came up to my room in the old house, and I suppose Etna is something like two hundred times as high.\" \"That does sound a serious undertaking,\" Matteo said, laughing; \"and I am afraid that I shall never see the view from the top of Etna. Certainly I shall not, if it will be necessary beforehand to be always exercising my muscles by running up the stairs of high houses.\" The next day they were off Girgenti, the port at which they hoped to obtain a cargo. They steered in until they encountered a fishing boat, and learned from those on board that there was no Genoese vessel in port, nor, as far as the men knew, any state galleys anywhere in the neighbourhood. Obtaining this news, they sailed boldly into the port and dropped anchor. Francis, who had received before starting a list of houses with whom Signor Polani was in the habit of doing business, at once rowed ashore, Matteo and Giuseppi accompanying him. His business arrangements were soon completed. The harvest had been a good one, and there was an abundance of corn to be had at a cheap rate. In half an hour he arranged for as large a quantity as the Lido would carry. The work of loading soon commenced, and in four days the ship was full up to the hatches. Francis went on shore to settle the various accounts, and was just making the last payment when Matteo ran into the office. \"Four Genoese galleys are entering the bay!\" Francis ran out, and saw four Genoese galleys rowing in. \"It is too late to escape. Even were we empty we could not get away; but laden as the Lido is, they could row three feet to her one.\" \"What shall we do, Francisco?\" Francis stood for half a minute thinking. \"You had better stay here, Matteo. I will row out to the ship, and send most of the men on shore. If they seize the ship, they may not take those on board prisoners; but if they do, there is no reason why they should take us all.\" \"You had better come on shore too, Francisco, and leave the captain in charge. You can do no good by staying there; and Polani would be more concerned at your capture than he would at the loss of a dozen ships. If you could do any good, it would be different; but as it is, it would be foolish to risk capture.\" \"I will see,\" Francis said. \"At any rate, do you stop here.\" Jumping into a boat, he rowed towards the Lido, which was lying but a cable\u0027s length from the shore. As he neared her, he shouted to the men to lower the boats. \"Captain,\" he said, \"I do not know whether there is any danger of being captured by the Genoese. But it is useless to run any unnecessary risk. Therefore send all the crew but three or four men on shore. If the Genoese board us, we have our papers as peaceful traders buying wheat; but if, in spite of that, they capture us, we must take our chance.\" \"Surely you are not thinking of stopping, Messer Francisco. The padrone would be terribly vexed if you were taken. He specially ordered me, before we started, to see that no unnecessary risk was run, and to prevent you from thrusting yourself into danger. Therefore, as captain of the ship, I must insist that you go on shore.\" \"I think I ought to stay here,\" Francis said. \"I do not think so,\" the captain said firmly, \"and I will not suffer it. I have to answer for your safety to the padrone; and if you do not go by yourself, I shall order the men to put you into one of the boats by force. I mean no disrespect; but I know my duty, and that is to prevent you from falling into the hands of the Genoese.\" \"I will not oblige you to use force, captain,\" Francis said, smiling, \"and will do as you wish me.\" In five minutes the men were all--save four, whom the captain had selected--in the boat, and rowing towards shore. Matteo was awaiting them when they landed. \"That is right, Francisco. I was half afraid you would stay on board. I know how obstinate you are whenever you take a thing into your head.\" \"The captain was more obstinate still, Matteo, and said that unless I came away he would send me on shore by force; but I don\u0027t like deserting the ship.\" \"That is nonsense, Francisco. If the Genoese take her, they take her, and your remaining on board could not do any good. What are you going to do now?\" \"We will at once leave the place with the men, Matteo, and retire into the country behind. It is not likely the Genoese would land and seize us here, but they might do so, or the inhabitants, to please Genoa, might seize us and send us on board. At any rate, we shall be safer in the country.\" The men had, by the captain\u0027s orders, brought their arms ashore on leaving the ship. This was the suggestion of Francis, who said that, were they unarmed, the people might seize them and hand them over to the Genoese. At the head of this party, which was about fifty strong, Francis marched up through the little town and out into the country. He had really but little fear, either that the Genoese would arrest them on shore, or that the people would interfere with them, for they would not care to risk the anger of Venice by interfering in such a matter. He thought it probable, however, that if his men remained in the town, broils would arise between them and any of the Genoese sailors who might land. As soon as the Genoese galleys came up to the head of the bay, a boat was lowered and rowed to the Lido, at whose masthead the Venetian flag was flying. An officer, followed by six men, climbed up on to the deck. \"Are you the captain of this ship?\" the officer asked as the captain approached him. \"I am,\" the captain said. \"What ship is it?\" \"It is the Lido, the property of Messer Polani, a merchant of Venice, and laden with a cargo of wheat.\" \"Then you are my prisoner,\" the Genoese said. \"I seize this vessel as lawful prize.\" \"There is peace between the republics,\" the captain said. \"I protest against the seizure of this ship, as an act of piracy.\" \"We have news that several of our ships have been seized by the Venetians,\" the officer said; \"and we therefore capture this vessel in reprisal. Where are your crew?\" \"There are only four on board,\" the captain said. \"We have filled up our cargo, and were going to sail tomorrow, and therefore the rest of the crew were allowed to go on shore; and I do not think it is likely that they will return now,\" for one of the Genoese sailors had hauled down the flag of Venice, and had replaced it with that of Genoa. The Genoese officer briefly examined the vessel. \"Whom have you here on board with you?\" he asked, struck with the furniture and fittings of Francis\u0027 cabin. \"This is the cabin of Matteo Giustiniani, a young noble of Venice, who is making his first voyage, in order to fit himself for entering the service of the state: and of Francisco Hammond, who stands high in the affections of my patron.\" The Genoese uttered an angry exclamation. The name of Polani was well known in Genoa as one of the chief merchants of Venice and as belonging to a ducal house, while the family of Giustiniani was even more illustrious; and had these passengers fallen into his hands, a ransom might have been obtained greatly exceeding the value of the Lido and her cargo. Leaving four of his men on board he went off to the galley of the officer commanding the fleet, and presently returned with a large boat full of sailors. \"You and your men can go ashore,\" he said to the captain. \"The admiral does not deem you worth the trouble of carrying to Genoa; but be quick, or you will have to swim to shore.\" As the Lido\u0027s boats had all gone ashore, the captain hailed a fishing boat which was passing, and with the four sailors was rowed to shore, well content that he had escaped the dungeons of Genoa. He rightly imagined that he and his men were released solely on account of the paucity of their numbers. Had the whole crew been captured, they would have been carried to Genoa; but the admiral did not care to bring in five prisoners only, and preferred taking the ship alone. Francis, with his party, followed the line of the coast, ascending the hills which rose steeply from the edge of the sea at a short distance from the town. He had brought with him from the town a supply of food sufficient for four or five days, and encamped in a little wood near the edge of the cliff. From this they had a view of the port, and could watch the doings of the Genoese galleys. Fires were lit and meat cooked over them; and just as the meal was prepared the captain and the four sailors joined them, amid a hearty cheer from the crew. \"I have made my protest,\" the captain said as he took his seat by the side of Francis, \"and the padrone can make a complaint before the council if he thinks fit to do so; but there is small chance that he will ever recover the Lido, or the value of her cargo.\" \"I don\u0027t like losing the ship,\" Francis said. \"Of course, it is only a stroke of bad fortune, and we could neither fly nor defend ourselves. Still one hates arriving home with the story that one has lost the ship.\" \"Yes,\" the captain agreed. \"Messer Polani is a just man, yet no one cares to employ men who are unlucky; and the worst of it is that the last ship I commanded was wrecked. Many men would not have employed me again, although it wasn\u0027t my fault. But after this second affair, in a few months\u0027 time, I shall get the name of being an unlucky man, and no one in his senses would employ a man who is always losing his ships.\" \"Do you think that there is any chance of our recapturing it, captain?\" \"Not the least in the world,\" the captain replied. \"Even supposing that we could get on board, and overpower the Genoese without being heard, and get her out of the port without being seen, we should not get away. Laden as she is with grain, she will sail very slowly, and the Genoese would overtake her in a few hours; and I needn\u0027t tell you that then there would be very little mercy shown to any on board.\" \"That is true enough,\" Francis said. \"Still, I do not like the idea of losing the Lido.\" After the meal was over Francis rose, and asked Matteo to accompany him on a stroll along the cliffs, Giuseppi as usual following them. They walked along until they rounded the head of the bay, and were able to look along the coast for some distance. It was steep and rocky, and worn into a number of slight indentations. In one of these rose a ledge of rocks at a very short distance from the shore. \"How much further are we going, Francis?\" Matteo said when they had walked a couple of miles. \"About a quarter of a mile, Matteo. I want to examine that ledge of rocks we saw from the first point.\" \"What on earth do you want to look at them for, Francis? You certainly are the most curious fellow I ever met. You scoffed at me when I said I should like to go up Mount Etna, and now here you are, dragging me along this cliff, just to look at some rocks of no possible interest to any one.\" \"That is the point to be inquired into, Matteo. I think it\u0027s possible they may prove very interesting.\" Matteo shrugged his shoulders, as he often did when he felt too lazy to combat the eccentric ideas of his English friend. \"There we are,\" Francis said at last, standing on the edge of the cliff and looking down. \"Nothing could be better.\" \"I am glad you think so, Francisco,\" Matteo said, seating himself on the grass. \"I hope you intend to stay some little time to admire them, for I own that I should like a rest before I go back.\" Francis stood looking at the rocks. The bay was a shallow one, and was but five or six hundred yards from point to point, the rocks rising nearly in a line between the points, and showing for about two hundred yards above water, and at about the same distance from the cliffs behind them. \"What height do you think those rocks are above the water, Giuseppi?\" \"It is difficult to judge, signor, we are so high above them; but I should think in the middle they must be ten or twelve feet.\" \"I should think it likely they were more than double that, Giuseppi; but we shall see better when we get down to the bottom. I daresay we shall find a place where we can clamber down somewhere.\" \"My dear Francisco,\" Matteo said earnestly, \"is anything the matter with you? I begin to have doubts of your sanity. What on earth do these rocks matter to you, one way or the other? or what can you care whether they are thirty inches or thirty feet above the water? \"They do not differ from other rocks, as far as I can see. They are very rugged and very rough, and would be very awkward if they lay out at sea instead of in this little bay, where they are in nobody\u0027s way. Is it not enough that you have tramped two miles to have a look at them, which means four miles, as we have got to return somehow? And now you talk about climbing down that break-neck cliff to have a look at them close!\" But Francis paid no attention to Matteo\u0027s words. He was gazing down into the clear smooth water, which was so transparent that every stone and pebble at the bottom could be seen. \"The water looks extremely shallow, Giuseppi. What do you think?\" \"It seems to me, signor, that there is not a foot of water between the rocks and the shore.\" \"It does look so, Giuseppi; but it is possible that the transparency of the water deceives us, and that there may be ten or twelve feet of water there. However, that is what we must go down and find out. Now the first thing is to look about, and find some point at which we can get down to the beach.\" \"Well, I will lie down and take a nap till you come back,\" Matteo said in a tone of resignation. \"I have no interest either in these rocks or in the water; and as far as I can protest, I do so against the whole proceeding, which to me savours of madness.\" \"Don\u0027t you understand, you silly fellow, what I am thinking about?\" Francis said impatiently. \"Not in the smallest degree, Francisco; but do not trouble to tell me--it makes no matter. You have some idea in your head. Carry it out by all means; only don\u0027t ask me to cut my hands, tear my clothes, and put myself into a perspiration by climbing down that cliff.\" \"My idea is this, Matteo. There is no chance of carrying off the Lido by speed from the Genoese; but if we could get her out of the bay we might bring her round here and lay her behind those rocks, and the Genoese would pass by without dreaming she was there. Half a mile out those rocks would look as if they form part of the cliff, and none would suspect there was a passage behind them.\" \"That is something like an idea!\" Matteo said, jumping to his feet. \"Why did you not tell me of it before? You have quite alarmed me. Seriously, I began to think that you had become a little mad, and was wondering whether I had not better go back and fetch the captain and some of his men to look after you. \"Now let us look at your rocks again. Why, man, there is not water enough to float a boat between them and the shore, much less the Lido, which draws nine foot of water now she is loaded.\" \"I don\u0027t know, Matteo. Looking down on water from a height is very deceiving. If it is clear and transparent, there is nothing to enable you to judge its depth. At any rate it is worth trying. Before we go down, we will cut some long stiff rods with which we can measure the depth. But we have first to find a place where we can get down to the water.\" After a quarter of an hour\u0027s search, they found a point where the descent seemed practicable. A little stream had worn a deep fissure in the face of the rock. Shrubs and bushes had grown up in the crevices and afforded a hold for the hands, and there appeared no great difficulty in getting down. Before starting they cut three stiff slender rods twelve feet in length. They then set to work to make the descent. It was by no means difficult, and in a few minutes they stood by the edge of the water. \"It is a great advantage, the path being so easy,\" Francis said, \"for in case they did discover the ship we could land and climb to the top before they had time to come to shore, and once there we could keep the whole force in those galleys at bay. Now for the main point, the depth of the water.\" Matteo shook his head. \"It is useless to take the trouble to undress, Francis,\" he said, as the latter threw off his jacket. \"Giuseppi can wade out to the rocks without wetting his knees.\" \"Giuseppi can try if he likes,\" Francis said, \"but I will wager he will not get far.\" Giuseppi, as convinced as Matteo of the shallowness of the water, stepped into it, but was surprised to find that, before he had gone many paces, the water was up to his waist. \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t have believed it if I hadn\u0027t seen it,\" Matteo said when he returned, \"but I think he must have got into a deep hole among the rocks. However, we shall soon see,\" and he too began to undress. In a few minutes the three lads were swimming out towards the rocks which, as Francis had anticipated, rose from twenty to thirty feet above the level of the sea. The water deepened fast, and for the last thirty or forty yards, they were unable to touch the bottom, even when thrusting down their rods to the fullest depth. They then tried the depth in the passages at the end of the rocks, and found that there was ample water for the Lido. When they ascertained this to their satisfaction they swam back to the shore. \"I shall believe you in future, Francis, even if you assert that the moon is made of cheese. I could have taken an oath that there was not a foot of water between those rocks and the shore.\" \"I hardly ventured to hope that it was as deep as it is,\" Francis said, \"but I know how deceiving clear water is, when you look down upon it from a height. However, that point is settled.\" \"But they would see our masts above the rocks, Francisco. They are sure to keep a sharp lookout as they go along.\" \"We must take the masts out of her,\" Francis said. \"I don\u0027t know how it is to be done, but the captain will know, and if that can\u0027t be managed we must cut them down. There is no difficulty about that. \"Now we will make our way back again, it will be dark in a couple of hours\u0027 time. Everything depends upon whether they have towed the Lido out and anchored her among their galleys. If they have, I fear the scheme is impracticable, but if they let her remain where she is lying, we might get her out without being noticed, for there is no moon.\" As they began to ascend the cliff, Francis stopped suddenly. \"We should never be able to find this place in the dark,\" he said. \"Giuseppi, you must stay here. Do you collect a quantity of dried sticks, and lay them in readiness at that point opposite the ledge. We will show a light as we come along, that is if we succeed in getting the Lido out, and directly you see it set fire to the sticks. The fire will be a guide to us as to the position of the rocks.\" \"Perhaps I had better take the sticks off to the ledge, Messer Francisco, and light my fire on the rock at the end. The water is deep a few yards out, as we found, so you could sail close to the fire and then round behind the rocks without danger.\" \"That will be the best way, Giuseppi; but how will you get the sticks off without wetting them?\" \"I will make a bundle three or four times as big as I want,\" Giuseppi said, \"and then half of them will be dry. I can put my clothes on them and the tinder. I will answer for the fire, but I would rather have been with you in your adventure.\" \"There will be no danger there, Giuseppi, so you need not be anxious about us. It has to be done quietly and secretly, and there will be no fighting. These Genoese are too strong to think of that; and if we are discovered in the attempt, or as we make off, we shall take to our boats again and row straight on shore. \"Keep a sharp lookout for us, we will hoist two lights, one above the other, to prevent your mistaking any fishing boat which may be coming along for us. \"Now, Matteo, for a climb. We have no time to lose.\" The two lads climbed to the top of the cliff, and then started at a brisk pace along the top, and in half an hour reached the wood. \"We were beginning to wonder what had become of you,\" the captain said as they joined him. \"We have been settling how to carry off the Lido,\" Francis said, \"and have arranged everything.\" The captain laughed. \"If we could fly with her through the air, you might get her away, but I see no other way. I have been thinking it over since you left. With luck we might get her safely out of the bay, but the galleys row four feet to our one, and as they would be sure to send some one way, and some the other, along the coast; they would pick us up again in two or three hours after daylight.\" \"Nevertheless we have settled it, captain. We have found a place where we can hide her, and the Genoese might search the coast for a month without finding her.\" \"If that be so it is possible,\" the captain said eagerly, \"and you may be sure you will not find us backward in doing our best.\" Francis described the nature and position of the rock which would afford a shelter, and the means by which they had ascertained that there was plenty of water for the Lido behind it. \"It seems plausible,\" the captain said when he had concluded, \"and I am quite ready to make the attempt, if, in your opinion, it can be done. You are Messer Polani\u0027s representative, and for my own sake as well as his, I would do anything which promises a chance of recapturing the ship.

I daresay they intend to sail tomorrow morning, and did not think it worth the trouble to get up the anchor and tow her out to where they are lying.\" The details of the expedition were now discussed and arranged, and the men told off to their various duties, and at eleven o\u0027clock at night, when all in the town were fast asleep, the party quitted the bivouac and marched down again to the port.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3104/85502.html","bookId":940,"book":{"id":940,"title":"The Lion of Saint Mark","description":"简介： Of all the chapters of history, there are few more interesting or wonderful than that which tells the story of the rise and progress of Venice.
