{"id":109673,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"The third book in the Love Story series, 2010\n 1. Hello Kitty\n BEING THE JOURNAL OF ABIGAIL VON NORMAL, Emergency Backup Mistress of the Greater Bay Area Night\n The City of San Francisco is being stalked by a huge, shaved vampyre cat named Chet, and only I, Abby Normal, emergency backup mistress of the Greater Bay Area night, and my manga-haired love monkey, Foo Dog, stand between the ravenous monster and a bloody massacre of the general public. Which isn\u0027t, like, as bad as it sounds, because the general public kind of sucks ass.\n Still, I think that this battle of dark powers; the maintenance of my steamy, forbidden romance; the torturous break-in of a new pair of red vinyl, thigh-high Skankenstein\u0026reg; platform boots; as well as the daily application of complex eye makeup and whatnot, totally justify my flunking Biology 102. (Introduction to Mutilation of Preserved Marmot Cadavers, with Mr. Snavely, who totally has his way with the marmots when no one is around, I have it on good authority.) But try to tell that to the mother unit, who deserves this despair and disappointment for cursing me with her tainted and small-boobed DNA.\n Allow me to catch you up, s\u0027il vous pla\u0026icirc;t. Pay attention, bitches, there will be a test.\n Three lifetimes ago, or maybe it was like last semester, because like the song says, \"time is like a river of slippery excretions when you\u0027re in love\"-anyway-during winter break, Jared and I were in Walgreens looking for hypoallergenic eye makeup when we encountered the beautiful, redheaded Countess Jody and her consort of blood, my Dark Lord, the vampyre Flood, who was totally disguised in jeans and flannel as a loser.\n And I was all, \"Nosferatu.\" Whispered to Jared like a night wind through dead trees.\n And Jared was all, \"No way, you sad, deluded little slut.\"\n And I was all, \"Shut your fetid penis port, you spunk-breathed poseur.\" Which he took as a compliment, so that\u0027s how I meant it, because while Jared is deeply gay, he\u0027s never really gayed anyone up, except maybe his pet rat, Lucifer. Strictly speaking, I think Jared would be considered a rodentsexual, if not for the difficult geometry of the relationship. (See, size does matter!)\n Note to self: I should totally set Jared up with Mr. Snavely and they can talk about squirrel-shagging and whatnot and maybe I won\u0027t have to repeat Bio 102.\n Anyway, Jared is a fitting support player in the tragedy that is my life, as he dresses dismal chic and excels at brooding, self-loathing, and allergies to beauty products. I\u0027ve tried to talk him into going pro.\n \u0027Kayso, the vampyre Flood had me meet him at a club, where I offered up myself to his dark desires, which he totally rejected because of his eternal love of the Countess. So he bought me a cappuccino instead and appointed me to be their official minion. It is the duty of the minion to rent apartments, do laundry, and bring the masters a sack with a tasty kid in it, although I never did that last part because the masters don\u0027t like kids.\n \u0027Kayso, the vampyre Flood gave me money and I rented a tr��s cool loft in the SOMA (which is widely accepted to be the best \u0027hood for vampyres because there\u0027s mostly new buildings and no one would suspect ancient creatures of purest evil to hang out there). But it turns out, it was like half a block from the tr��s cool loft in the SOMA that they already lived in. \u0027Kayso, when I take the key to them, hoping they will bestow the dark gift of immortality upon me, this limo full of wasted college-age guys and a painted blue ho with ginormous fake boobs pulls up. And they\u0027re all, \"Where is Flood? We need to talk to Flood. And let us in,\" and other demanding shit. And I\u0027m all, \"No way, step off Smurfett. There\u0027s no one named Flood here.\"\n I know! I was all, Oh-my-fucking-zombie-jebus-on-a-pogo-stick! She was blue!\n And I\u0027m not racist, so shut up. She clearly had self-esteem issues that she compensated for with giant fake boobs, slutty blue body-paint, and doing a carload full of stoners for money. I\u0027m not judging her by the color of her skin. Everyone copes. When I got braces I went through a Hello Kitty phase that lasted well into my fifteens, and Jared maintains that I am still perky at heart, which is not true. I am simply complex. But more about the blue hooker later, because right then the Asian guy looks at his watch and says, \"Too late, it\u0027s sunset.\" And they drove off. Which is when I opened the door into the stairwell to the loft and was confronted by Chet, the huge shaved vampyre cat. (Except, at the time, I didn\u0027t know his name, and he was wearing a red sweater, so I didn\u0027t know he was shaved, and he wasn\u0027t a vampyre yet. But huge.)\n So I\u0027m all, \"Hey, kitty, go away.\" And he did, leaving only William, the huge shaved cat homeless guy, lying on the steps. I thought he was dead, because of the smell, but it turns out he was only passed out from alcohol and partially drained of blood and stuff. But I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s dead now because, later, Foo and I found his stank-ass clothes on the steps of the loft, full of the gray dust that people turn to when a vampyre drains them.\n So upstairs I\u0027m all, \"There\u0027s a dead guy and a huge kitty in a sweater on your steps.\" And the Countess and Flood are all, \"Whatever.\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"And there was a limo full of stoners here who were totally hunting you.\"\n And they were all, \"Whoa.\" And they seemed more freaked out than you\u0027d think, for ancient creatures of dark forbidden romance and whatnot. And it turns out they weren\u0027t-I mean, aren\u0027t. I mean, sure, their love is eternal, and they are creatures of unspeakable evil and stuff, but they are not ancient at all. It turns out that the vampyre Flood is only like nineteen, and he\u0027s only known the Countess for like two months. And she\u0027s only like twenty-six, which, while a little crusty, is not that ancient. And despite her advanced age, the Countess is beautiful, with long, totally natch red hair and milky skin, green eyes like emerald fire, and a smoking body that could turn a girl totally lesbo if she wasn\u0027t already a slave to the mad, man-ninja sex-fu of the delicious Foo Dog. (Foo keeps insisting that he can\u0027t be a ninja because he\u0027s Chinese and ninjas are Japanese, but he\u0027s just being stubborn and goes all Angry, Angry Asian on me whenever I bring it up.)\n \u0027Kayso, in the master\u0027s loft I see these two bronze statues, one of this crusty businessman-looking guy, and the other looks like the Countess, except it\u0027s totally naked, or in a leotard, and bronze. And I\u0027m all, \"Exhibitionist, much, Countess? Did it come with a pole?\"\n And she\u0027s all, \"Help Tommy move furniture, Wednesday.\" Like that makes any sense at all. (Turns out that Wednesday is a Gothish character from some crusty movie.)\n \u0027Kayso, later, by virtue of my extensive research and sneaking around and whatnot, I find out that the statues aren\u0027t statues at all. That the Countess used to be inside the statue of her, and that inside the crusty businessman statue is the real ancient creature of unspeakable evil, the nosferatu that turned the Countess. And the vampyre Flood, who wasn\u0027t a vampyre at all at the time, had bronzed the two of them when they were sleeping the deep sleep of the daytime dead, which is like the deepest sleep you can get. (You should know right now, that there\u0027s no yawning, gentle drift into sleepytime for vampyres. When the sun breaks the horizon, they drop rag-doll dead on the spot, and you can pose them, paint them, put their hands on their junk and post the pics on the Web, and they won\u0027t know a thing until sundown when they come on like a light and they\u0027re wondering why their naughty bits are green and their inbox is full of propositions from elfin_love.com.)\n I know. Whoa!\n It turns out that Flood, who was known as Tommy, was chosen by the Countess as her day-minion, blood lunch, and love monkey, because he worked nights at the Safeway. Then, the old vampyre, who had turned the Countess only like a week before, started fucking with them-saying he was going to kill Tommy and generally harsh Jody\u0027s reality. \u0027Kayso, Flood and his stoner Safeway night crew (called the Animals) hunted down the alpha vampyre, who was sleeping in a big yacht in the Bay, and they stole like jillions in art from the yacht and blew it up with the vampyre in it, which seriously put habaneras in his \u0027tude lube, but when he came out of the water, they fucked him up a good long time with spear guns and whatnot.\n I know! Oh-my-fucking-god-ponies-in-the-barbecue! I know! It just goes to show you, like Lord Byron says in the poem: \"Given enough weed and explosives, even a creature of most sophisticated and ancient dark power can be undone by a few stoners.\"\n I\u0027m paraphrasing. It may have been Shelley.\n \u0027Kayso, the Countess saves the old vampyre from being toasted, but she promises the cops (there were these two cops) to take him away and never come back to the City, but when they go to sleep, Flood, who couldn\u0027t bear to lose Jody, took them downstairs to the biker-sculptors and had them bronzed. But when he was trying to explain to the Countess about why he did it, he drilled holes in the bronze by her ears, and she turned into mist, streamed into the room, and turned him into a vampyre. Which totally surprised him, because he didn\u0027t even know she knew how to do either of those things. (Misting and turning, I mean.)\n So then they\u0027re like, both vampyres, eternal in their love, but somewhat lame in their night skills. Because Jody had been feeding off of Tommy, she hadn\u0027t thought through what they would eat after Tommy turned vampyre. So, first they went to this homeless guy we\u0027ll call William the Huge Cat Guy (because that\u0027s what people call him) because he used to sit on Market Street with Chet and a sign that said, I AM POOR AND MY CAT IS HUGE. And they ended up renting the huge cat, Chet, to be their shared blood lunch. But it turned out that a large part of Chet\u0027s kitty hugeness was fur, so in order to facilitate the biting process, they shaved him. I\u0027m just glad that I wasn\u0027t their minion yet, because I think we all know who would have ended up shaving the kitty.\n But no! It didn\u0027t work. I\u0027m not sure why. But William got totally, date-rape-level hammered on the liquor he bought with the huge cat rent money, and they ended up feeding on him. Which is where I, the new princess-elect of darkness, was brought into the fold. (Into the \"fold\" means, like, the gang, as in gang of sheep, not fold like in what you do to T-shirts if you\u0027re a casual cotton slave at Old Navy.)\n It was I, who turned Tommy onto the needle exchange program, where he was able to use his pale thinness to convince them he was a junkie and get syringes so they could take William\u0027s blood and put it in the fridge for the Countess to have in her coffee. Turns out that the only way the vampyre can tolerate real food or drink is if it has a little human blood in it. (The Countess likes blood on her fries, which is at once tr��s cool and deeply fucked-up.)\n So, as soon as the Countess and Flood figured out the deal with blood and food, William the Huge Cat Guy wandered off and the Countess had to go find him, since she has more experience at hunting the night, while Flood and I moved stuff from one loft to the other. But I had to get lice shampoo for my useless little sister, Ronnie, who was plagued by vermin, and Flood sent me home early to spare me the wrath of the mother unit because he didn\u0027t want his minion on restriction. (So noble. I think that\u0027s when I fell in love with him.) Then he took the bronzed old vampyre down to the water to dump him in the Bay before the Countess got back. It was clear to me that Tommy had jealousy issues with the old vampyre, and wanted to get rid of him. Except he ran out of dark before he got to the Bay and had to leave the old vampyre sitting by the Ferry Building on the Embarcadero and run from the sun for his life. At the last minute, the Animals drive by in their limo with their stupid blue ho and scoop the vampyre Flood off the street just before he was incinerated by the sun.\n I know. WTF?\n (FYI, when I type WTF, you are supposed to read it What the Fuck? Same with OMG, and OMFG, which are Oh My God and Oh My Fucking God. Only a completely lame Disney Channel nimnode pronounces the letters. Even BMLWA, or Bite My Lily White Ass should only be spoken as letters if you are hanging out with nuns or other people who are embarrassed about being told to bite asses.)\n \u0027Kayso, the Animals go back to work at the Safeway, but not before they tie Flood to a bed frame, where the blue hooker tortured him to get him to turn her into a vampyre, because now she had like all the money that the Animals had gotten for the old vampyre\u0027s art, which was like six hundred thousand dollars, and she wanted to take her time spending it, so she wanted to be immortal. But Flood was like a complete vamp noob. He\u0027d never even killed anyone and turned them to dust or anything, so he didn\u0027t know how to change someone. The Countess didn\u0027t tell him that the chosen had to drink the vampyre\u0027s blood to receive the dark gift. So the blue ho tortures the shit out of him.\n I know, what a bitch.\n Meanwhile, the Countess found the huge cat guy, and I found the lice shampoo, but we don\u0027t know where Tommy is. But the Countess was burned from going out on some hot water pipes, so she fed on me, right there in the loft, and I was all, \"Oh shit, I\u0027m going to get the dark gift and I\u0027m, like, wearing my lime-green Chuck Taylors, which are totally not the kicks for becoming a creature of unspeakable power in.\" But no, the Countess just partook of my sanguine nectar so she could heal. That\u0027s probably where I fell in love with her. Anyway, she goes asking around about Tommy, and this completely crazy homeless guy who thinks he is the Emperor of San Francisco (you see him and his two dogs in the north end of the City all the time) says that one of the Animals was asking around about Flood.\n So I\u0027m all, \"Uh-oh.\"\n And the Countess is all, \"Yep.\"\n Next thing you know, we are at the Marina Safeway and the Countess-wearing her black jeans and red leather jacket, but no lipstick-underhands a steel reinforced trash can like as big as a lesbian gym teacher through the big front window, and she just walks right through the falling glass, badass as shit, into the store and starts kicking stoner ass. It was glorious. But she didn\u0027t kill anyone, which turned out to be a mistake, as was, in my humble opinion, not wearing any lipstick. For while it was a heroic ass-kicking as has ever been delivered in real life, it would have been that much cooler if she had some black lipstick on, or maybe something in a dark maroon. But they told her that Tommy was tied up at Lash\u0027s, the black guy\u0027s, apartment.\n And their shit was all busted up, and I was like, \"You bitches have been powned!\"\n And the Countess was like, \"That\u0027s cute. Let\u0027s go get Tommy.\"\n She can be kind of a bitch sometimes. Anyway, we go to the apartment where Tommy is being held, but when we get there, he\u0027s still tied to the bed frame, but stood up against a wall, all naked and covered in blood, even his junk. And the blue ho is dead on the floor.\n And I\u0027m all, \"Uh-oh.\"\n And the Countess is all, \"Yep.\"\n And she says something about how the blue ho must have broken her neck or something, because if Tommy had drained her, she would have turned to dust and there would have been no body. Anyway, the cab ride back to the loft was tr��s awkward, you know, with Flood naked and covered with blood and the two of them all, \"Oh I love you\" and, \"Oh I love you, too.\" And I was being kind of a mopey little emo queen because I was jealous of both of them because they had their dark and eternal love for each other and I had like my lime-green Chucks and Jared the gay-bait rat-shagger.\n So that was good. The rescue and whatnot. Because we found the old vampyre art money that the Animals had paid to the blue ho, which was like a half a million dollars. But then we found out that the blue ho was not dead, but somehow had accidentally drunk some of Tommy\u0027s blood when she kissed him during his torture and now she was nosferatu. And she turned all the Animals. Which, you know, was bad. And not in the good way.\n And the old vampyre had somehow escaped his bronze shell, and he was coming after Tommy and Jody, and even me? He even shook the living shit out of William the Huge Cat Guy while Jared and I watched from an alley across the street.\n I know! We were all, \"Whoa?\"\n So it\u0027s like, Christmas night, and Jared and I are watching the midnight show of The Nightmare Before Christmas at the Metreon. And we\u0027re all traumatized and whatnot from watching the vampyre pound the huge cat guy, and the Countess calls us. And she and my Dark Lord Flood meet us for coffee at this Chinese diner, which is like the only thing open because the Chinese totally blow off Christmas because there are no dragons or firecrackers in the story.\n Note to self: Write narrative poem exploring Christmas if the three wise men had given baby Jesus firecrackers, a dragon, and mu-shu pork instead of that other crap.\n So, after all night drinking coffee laced with Jared\u0027s blood and getting the story on the old vampyre from the Countess and Flood, we go back to the loft and there, in the stairway, is the old vampyre, naked. And he\u0027s all, \"I had to do some laundry. That guy peed on my tracksuit.\" (He was wearing a total gangsta yellow tracksuit when we saw him shaking the huge cat guy.)\n So we like ran, and we had to hide my masters in some rafters under the Bay Bridge when they went out at dawn. No yawning or anything-they just became dead. Well, undead.\n So we wrapped them in trash bags and duct tape and moved them to Jared\u0027s basement lair in Noe Valley. (His basement lair is sacrosanct-his father and stepmother are afraid that they might walk in on him wanking to gay porn-so it was safe for the masters.) Meanwhile, I went back to the loft to feed Chet the huge shaved cat and decapitate the old vampyre with Jared\u0027s dagger so I could get extra-credit points with the masters, but it turned out that I had not calculated sundown quite right. Since when does the sun go down at like five o\u0027clock? That\u0027s just fucking juvenile.\n Anyway, when I\u0027m on the steps I hear the old vampyre moving around upstairs. And I\u0027m all, \"Awkward.\" Then I hear a car pull up and I run out, right into the arms of this blond ho, who it turns out is the blue ho, who is now nosferatu, along with three of her vampyre minions who used to be the Animals. I know, \"Uh-oh.\"\n So she grabs me and is just about to tear my throat out, when the old vampyre grabs her by the neck and puts her face print in the hood of a Mercedes. He\u0027s all, \"You\u0027re breaking the rules, ho. You can\u0027t just go turning people willy-nilly.\"\n So I was doing a minor booty-dance of ownage at the blond ho, when they all turned on me. So I pull out Jared\u0027s dagger, but just the same I know they are going to have a huge group suck on my pale frame, when this totally fly, race-pimped Honda comes tearing out of the alley, and everything goes white light around the car. And my manga-haired love monkey, Foo, is totally in hero shades, and he\u0027s all, \"Get in.\"\n \u0027Kayso, he swept me away in his magic nerd-chariot, which he had rigged with ultraviolet floodlights that totally toasted the vamps with simulated sunlight. I know! I\u0027d have done him right there in the car if I was not trying to maintain my detached aura of aristocratic chill. So instead I kissed him within an inch of his life, then slapped him so he didn\u0027t think I was his personal slut, which I totally was. Would be.\n It turns out that Steve, which is Foo Dog\u0027s day-slave name, had totally been staking out the Countess Jody\u0027s apartment for like a month, since he figured out that she was a vampyre when some blood from one of the old vamp\u0027s victims turned up in his hemo-lab at Berkeley. Foo is like some kind of biotech ��ber-genius, in addition to having mad ninja-driving skills.\n Then Foo dropped me off at Tulley\u0027s on Market, where I met Jared and Jody, who sneaked by Jared\u0027s parents by pretending to be lovers, which is disgusting in so many ways I kind of gagged a little when I typed it. (Jared is my emergency backup BFF, but he is a pervy little rat-shagger, as the Countess affectionately refers to him.)\n So the Countess is all, \"I\u0027m going back to the loft to get the money.\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"No, the old vampyre.\"\n And she is all, \"He is not the boss of me.\" (Or something like that. I\u0027m paraphrasing.)\n And I\u0027m all, \"Whatever, make sure you feed Chet.\"\n So we go back to Jared\u0027s, and when we get there, the vampyre Flood is all fucked up from trying to climb face-down a building in the Castro after a delicious drag queen, like Dracula does in the book (only in the book it\u0027s not in the Castro and Dracula isn\u0027t after a drag queen).\n Note to self: When I am finally made nosferatu, do not try to climb face-down a wall.\n So then my sweet love ninja Foo shows up. And he\u0027s all, \"I couldn\u0027t leave you out here, unprotected.\" And secretly I was all, \"You rock my stripy socks, Foo,\" but publically I just kissed him and tastefully dry humped his leg a little. So we all got in his fly Honda and went back to the loft.\n When we got there, the second-floor windows were open, and Flood could hear that the old vampyre was up there with Jody.\n And Foo was all, \"Let me go.\" And out of the hatchback, he pulls this long duster that\u0027s covered with little glass warts. And Foo is all, \"UV LEDs. Like sunlight.\"\n The street-level fire door was locked, so Flood was all, \"I\u0027ll go.\"\n But Foo was all, \"No, it will burn you.\"\n But they covered Flood all over, gloves, hat, and a gas-mask that Foo keeps around in case of emergency biology and whatnot, then he put on the duster. Foo gave him a rubber tarp and a baseball bat, and Flood starts working the street like a half-pipe, running up a building on one side, then up the other, until he goes feetfirst through the upstairs window. Personally, I think the Countess could have just jumped up there, but she\u0027s been a vampyre longer than Flood and has better skills.\n \u0027Kayso, there\u0027s this blinding white light from the windows, and next thing we know, the old vampyre comes crashing through the window like a flaming comet and hits the street right by us. And he gets up all blackened and snarly and whatnot, and Foo holds up his UV floodlight and he\u0027s all, \"Step off, vampyre scum.\" And the old vampyre ran off.\n Then Flood comes out the door carrying the Countess, who is looking way more dead than usual, and we took them to a motel to hide them until we could figure out what to do. Foo stole some donor blood from the lab at his college and gave it to Flood and the Countess so they could heal. And Foo\u0027s all, \"You know, I\u0027ve been working on the blood I found on the victims, and I think I can reverse the process. I can turn you human again.\"\n Which is totally why he had been stalking the Countess when I met him. So Tommy and Jody were all, \"We\u0027ll think about it.\"\n \u0027Kayso, Flood is holding Jody on the bed, and they\u0027re talking softly, but I can hear them, because I\u0027m just by the door and the room\u0027s not that big. And it is clear that their love is eternal and will last for eons, but Flood doesn\u0027t like being a vampyre because the hours suck and whatnot, and Jody likes being a vampyre because of the power she feels after feeling like a little wuss-girl for many years, and they more or less say that they are going to split up just as the sun rises and they go out.\n And I was all, \"Oh, hell no.\"\n So I had them bronzed.\n I\u0027m looking at them now. We posed them like Rodin\u0027s The Kiss and they shall be together unto the end of time, or at least until we figure out how to let them out and not have them tear out our throats and whatnot. Foo says it\u0027s cruel, but the Countess told me that they could go to mist, and when they are mist time passes like a dream and it\u0027s all good.\n But Foo did figure out his serum thingy. We lured the Animals to our love nest and while I was wearing the fly leather jacket that Foo made me, complete with the UV LED warts, which is very cool and cyber, I drugged them and Foo changed them back to human. And the crazy old Emperor guy said he saw three young vampyres take the old vampyre and the formerly blue ho away on a ginormous yacht, so we don\u0027t have to worry about them anymore.\n Foo wants to cut Flood and Jody out of the bronze statue during the day, while they are sleeping, and turn them back to human. But the Countess doesn\u0027t want that. So I think we should just wait. We have this tr��s cool apartment, and all of the money, and Foo almost has his master\u0027s in bio-nerdism or whatever, and I only have to go home like twice a week so the mother unit still thinks I am living there. (The key was to condition her from age twelve that sleepovers are normal. Lily, my former sleepover BFF, calls it slowly boiling the frog, which I don\u0027t know what it means, but it sounds darkly mysterious.)\n So, we are secure in our love nest and as soon as Foo gets home I am going to reward him with the slow booty dance of forbidden love. But something is screeching outside. BRB.\n Fucksocks! It\u0027s Chet the huge shaved vampyre cat, down on the street. He looks bigger, and I think he ate a meter maid. Her little cart is running and there\u0027s an empty uniform on the curb.\n Bad kitty! GTG L8erz. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bite-me-a-love-story-a-love-story-3/page-1.html","bookId":2044,"book":{"id":2044,"title":"Bite Me: A Love Story (A Love Story #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The city of San Francisco is being stalked by a huge shaved vampyre cat named Chet, and only I, Abby Normal, emergency backup mistress of the Greater Bay Area night, and my manga-haired love monkey, Foo Dog, stand between the ravenous monster and a bloody massacre of the general public.
