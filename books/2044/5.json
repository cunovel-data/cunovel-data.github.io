{"id":109677,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"5. The Further Chronicles of Abby Normal, Miserable, Broken-hearted Emo-ho of the Night\n \u0027Kayso, who is outside my door but Baroness Buzzkill herself, the Motherbot, accompanied by those most crapacious homicide cops, Rivera and Cavuto.\n So I\u0027m all, \"Oh joy, does this caffeine fresh clusterfuck come with donuts?\" Which it turned out, it didn\u0027t, so really, WTF is the point of bringing cops?\n And the Mombot is all, \"You can\u0027t do this, and who is this boy, and where have you been, and you have no right, and blah, blah, blah, responsibility, worried sick, you\u0027re a horrible, horrible person and you ruined my life with your platform boots and your piercings.\"\n Okay, those weren\u0027t her exact words, but the subtext was there. And in retrospect, I may have erred in using the \"I\u0027m sleeping over at Lily\u0027s house\" gambit for two months running, when I was, in fact, living in my own tr��s cool love lair with a mysterious love ninja. So I decided to turn the tables on her by asking questions, before she got in the rhythm of grilling me and heaping me with mom guilt.\n So I\u0027m all, \"How did you find me?\"\n And the dark, Hispano cop steps up, and he\u0027s all, \"I called her.\"\n So I rolled up in his grill. Well, up in the knot of his tie, because he\u0027s taller than me. And I\u0027m all, \"I can\u0027t believe you ratted me out. You traitorous fuck!\"\n And the cop gets all chilly and he\u0027s all, \"I\u0027m not a traitor because I\u0027m not on your side, Allison.\" Using my day-slave name, just to fuck with me.\n So I\u0027m all thinking, Okay, cop, I can see that you believe that your shit cannot be shaken, and you are totally trying to come off all sly and badass in front of the Mombot so she might do you a good long time? I know-mating rituals of the ancient and crusty-makes you barf in your mouth a little, huh?\n So I go over to the big gay cop, and I\u0027m all soft-spoken little-girl voice, \"I thought we were on the same side because-well-because we know about the nosferatu, and all that money you got from his art collection. We\u0027re not? I\u0027m crushed.\" Totally hand to forehead, fake-heartbreak fainting. I was going to cry a little, but my mascara was lined up like the spikes on the gates of hell, and I didn\u0027t want it to go raccoon on me so early in the day, so only a sniffle. I wiped my nose on the big gay cop\u0027s sleeve.\n And the Momster is all, \"What? What? Nosferatu? What? Money? What?\"\n And Rivera is all, \"Excuse us a moment, Mrs. Green, we need to have a word with Allison.\"\n So the Mombot starts to go into the bedroom and I\u0027m all, \"Oh I don\u0027t think so. You can wait outside,\" or something like that, because it turns out I didn\u0027t want her to see the inner sanctum of our love nest, because she\u0027s a nurse and seeing the dog collars, test tubes, centrifuge, and whatnot might give her the wrong idea. (Foo and I like to get our mad scientist freak on in the privacy of the boudoir.)\n So Mom steps outside.\n And Foo is all, \"Owned, bitches!\" And he did a pathetic imitation of my own superb booty dance of ownage, and I was, at once, touched by his support, yet embarrassed by his tragic lack of rhythm and booticuity.\n And Rivera is all, \"Allison, how did you know about the money and the old vampyre and the yacht and you have no proof and blah, blah, I so can\u0027t decide whether I\u0027m the good cop or the bad cop, or if I\u0027m going to still pretend to be badass or totally crap my pants from the verbal death grip you just put on my man sac, blah, blah.\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"I know it all, cop,\" popping the p in cop because it makes both of them flinch a little. \"You need to exit and take the Mombot home or I will be forced to expose your evil shit to your masters, and not in the fun way.\"\n And the Hispano cop was all chill, nodding and smiling, which harshed my confidence somewhat. And he\u0027s all, \"That so, Allison? Well, Mr. Wong here is twenty-one, and you are still a minor, so among other things, we can take him in for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, kidnapping, and statutory rape.\" And he folds his arms all, \"Take that, bee-atch.\" Hip-hop superior.\n So I\u0027m like, \"You\u0027re right, he is totally taking advantage of my innocence. Foo, you ginormous perve!\" Then I slapped him, but for the drama, not because he might think I was a slut. \"I should have known when you had me shave my va-jay-jay into the shape of a beaver!\"\n And Foo\u0027s all, \"I did not!\"\n \"Pervy and redundant, don\u0027t you think?\" I asked the big gay cop, who wouldn\u0027t know a va-jay-jay if it bounced up to him and sang the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" (You ever notice that hardly anything besides the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" is spangled? There\u0027s no, like, the Raisin-Spangled Scone, or the Flea-Spangled Beagle. I\u0027m just saying.) So, I, like, start to pull up my skirt to further freak him out, like I\u0027m going to flash the beav, which was a bluff, because I am totally trimmed bat-shape and dyed lavender and I was wearing my hot-pink fishnets, which are full-on tights and put the PG-13 on my no-no place.\n But instead of hiding his head and screaming like a little bitch, which is what I was going for, the big gay cop is across the room and has Foo in handcuffs in like seconds, cranking them down tight.\n So Foo is all, \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\"\n And I\u0027m heartsick at his suffering, so I\u0027m like, \"Unhand him, you fascist-ass bear.\"\n And Rivera is all, \"Allison, we need to come to an understanding, or your boyfriend is going to jail, and even if the charges don\u0027t stick, he can kiss his master\u0027s degree good-bye.\"\n Powned! I was forced to lower my skirt in defeat. Foo\u0027s eyes were all anime-huge and started to get tear-spangled, and my noble love ninja looked all pleading to me like, \"Please, do not abandon me, despite my obvious emo tendencies.\"\n So I\u0027m like, \"We\u0027ll give you a hundred thousand dollars to leave our love lair like nothing happened.\"\n And Rivera is like, \"We\u0027re not interested in your money.\"\n And gay bear cop is like, \"Wait, where did you get that kind of money, anyway?\"\n And Rivera is like, \"Never mind, Nick, it\u0027s not about money.\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"OMG Rivera, your bad cop skills suck ass. It\u0027s always about the money. Don\u0027t you have a TV?\"\n And he\u0027s like, \"What happened out there this morning?\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"You know, vampyre kitties, meter maid sucked to dust, samurai in orange socks, Abby\u0027s kung-fu of solar ass-kicking.\" Then to Foo: \"Foo, the jacket is the sickest shit ever!\"\n \"Which is a good thing,\" Foo translated for the cops.\n And Rivera is all, \"Vampyre cats? That\u0027s what the Emperor said.\"\n \u0027Kayso, it\u0027s clear that the cops have doubts, so I explain the whole battle, and Foo\u0027s theory of how Chet is making vampyre kitties, and how we are pretty much fucked nine ways to Kwanzaa because it\u0027s the end of the world and whatnot, and there are metric buttloads of kitties in the City, and only two fly, vampyre-frying solar jackets, mine and Foo\u0027s, and we are being detained by law enforcement assbags instead of saving humanity.\n So Rivera\u0027s all, \"What about Flood and the redhead? You helped them, right?\"\n Kudos to Inspector Obvious, we\u0027re only living in their loft, spending their money, and hanging our damp towels on their bronzed bodies. I was all, \"They left. All the vampyres left. Didn\u0027t you talk to the Emperor? He saw them get on a boat at the Marina?\"\n \"The Emperor isn\u0027t the most dependable witness,\" Rivera says. \"And he didn\u0027t say anything about those two, but I find it hard to believe that a cat, even a vampyre cat, even a gang of vampyre house cats took down a full-grown parking enforcement officer.\"\n So I was like, \"Chet is not a normal vampyre kitty. He\u0027s huge. More huge than normal. He\u0027s getting huger. If you don\u0027t let Foo work his mad science skills to cure him, by next week Chet might be dry-humping the Transamerica Pyramid.\"\n Foo was nodding like a manga-haired bobblehead. He was all, \"Truth.\"\n The big gay Cavuto cop is all, \"Can you do that, kid? Can you put this shit storm back in the box?\"\n \"Absolutely,\" says Foo, when he totally has no clue how to catch Chet. \"I\u0027ll need some time, but leave the handcuffs on, because that\u0027s how I work best.\"\n Foo can be most sarcastic when faced with day dwellers less intelligent than himself, which is almost everyone.\n \u0027Kayso, Rivera takes the sleeve of my jacket and starts turning it over, looking at it, all Neanderthal discovers fire face. And he\u0027s all, \"Can you make one of these in a leather sport coat? Forty long?\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"Are you coming on to me?\"\n And he gagged a little (which was mean), and he\u0027s all, \"No. I am definitely not coming on to you, Allison. Not only are you the most irritating creature on the planet, you are a child.\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"A child?! A child?! Do these belong to a child?\" And I pulled up my top and flashed him. And not just a flash, a full, glorious boobosity.\n And he didn\u0027t say anything. So I turned my headlights on Foo and the big gay cop.\n And they\u0027re all, \"Um-uhr-uhr-um-\"\n I\u0027m like, \"Et tu, Foo?\" Which is Shakespearean for, \"You traitor!\"\n And I ran into the bedroom and locked the door. I was kind of wishing I\u0027d taken a hostage, except really the only weapon I had was a jacket with little light warts all over it, so I was limited to being dangerous to vampyres and emos who get their feelings hurt really easily by my snarky wit.\n \u0027Kayso, then I stared into the dark abyss that is the meaninglessness of human existence, because there was nothing on cable. And in searching the depths of my soul, I saw that I must stop using sex as a weapon, and that I must only use my powers of seduction for good, unless Foo wants to do something freaky, in which case, I can have him sign a waiver. Now, I realize that the only way for me to righteously explore my strength as a woman is to become nosferatu. And since the Countess and Lord Flood wouldn\u0027t bring me into the fold, I must find my own way to the blood power.\n \u0027Kayso, in a few minutes Rivera\u0027s at the door all, \"Allison, I think you\u0027d better come out here.\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"Oh no, Inspector, I can\u0027t open the door. I\u0027ve taken all these pills and everything\u0027s all wiggly. You\u0027ll have to break the door down.\"\n Then Foo\u0027s all, \"Abby, please come out. I need you.\" He used his I\u0027m sad, wounded, and locked in the castle tower with all my powers gone voice, which I didn\u0027t even know he had, but it was tragic and I had to come out and humble myself before the cops like a little bitch, despite my new resolve to partake of the dark gift.\n So I\u0027m all, \"What?\"\n And Rivera is all, \"Allison, we have an agreement with Mr. Wong. He will stay here and work on a solution to the cat problem, and in return for our not filing charges, you both will say nothing to anyone about our previous-uh-adventures, with Mr. Flood, Ms. Stroud, and any other persons of the blood-drinking persuasion. Nor will we mention any funds that may have changed hands, and who may be in possession of said funds. Agreed?\"\n I\u0027m all, \"Sweet!\"\n \"And you have to go home and live with your mother and sister,\" the evil Hispano cop continued.\n And I\u0027m all, \"No way!\"\n And all three of them are shaking their heads at me. And Foo, who is out of handcuffs now, is all, \"Abby, you have to go with them. You\u0027re still a minor and your mom will chuck a spaz if they don\u0027t bring you home.\"\n \"And if that happens, we\u0027ll have no choice but to drop a hammer on Mr. Wong,\" said Cavuto.\n And Foo\u0027s all, \"And to defend ourselves we\u0027ll have to tell everyone about everything. So we\u0027ll all be hosed and meanwhile, Chet the huge shaved cat will own the City, plus our relationship and stuff would be strained.\"\n And by \"and stuff,\" Foo meant that we would lose the love lair and no one would take care of Tommy and Jody, and Foo would have to become love ninja to some big guy in prison. We were owned.\n I was all, \"I blame my mother.\"\n I offered my wrists to Rivera for the cuffs.\n And they were all nodding, and \"Sure,\" and \"That works for me.\" And \"Yeah, I\u0027m good with that.\"\n But Rivera didn\u0027t put the cuffs on me.\n And I\u0027m all, \"Can we have a minute to say good-bye?\"\n And Rivera nods, so I start to lead Foo into the bedroom.\n And Rivera is all, \"Out here.\"\n So I unzip Foo\u0027s pants.\n And Cavuto grabs my arm and starts to drag me away, so I was forced to give Foo only a minor good-bye kiss that brushed his lips like a breeze from the tomb and left a little bit of a black lipstick streak on his cheek.\n And I\u0027m all, \"I will never forget you, Foo. They may tear us asunder, but our love will endure for eternity.\"\n And he\u0027s all, \"Call me when you get home.\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"I\u0027ll text you on the way.\"\n And he\u0027s all, \"Abby Normal, you rock my stripy socks.\" Which was totally romantic, because he doesn\u0027t wear stripy socks. I cried and my mascara melted in sorrow.\n Then Cavuto\u0027s all, \"Oh for fuck\u0027s sake.\" And he starts to lead me out the door, but turns to Foo and goes, \"Is that your tricked-out yellow Honda downstairs?\"\n And Foo is all, \"Yeah.\"\n And Cavuto\u0027s all, \"You know it\u0027s full of rats, right?\"\n And Foo\u0027s all, \"Yeah.\"\n And so I am a prisoner of the dreaded Motherbot and Foo faces the menace of Chet alone. Gotta jet, my sister, Ronnie, is asleep and I\u0027m going to Magic Marker a pentagram on her shaved head. L8erz.\n RIVERA\n As they were walking away from delivering Abby Normal and her mother to the apartment building in the Fillmore, Cavuto said, \"You know, if I\u0027d had Allison there around when I came out to my dad, I think he would have understood a lot more why I like guys.\"\n \"If the vampire cats\u0027 victims turn to dust, most won\u0027t even be reported unless someone sees the attack,\" Rivera said, hoping Cavuto\u0027s train of thought would head on to the next station.\n \"She\u0027s so obnoxious,\" said Cavuto. \"Like a whole Saturday night drunk tank full of obnoxious packed into one little body.\"\n \"Maybe if we get a cadaver dog,\" said Rivera.\n \"Okay, but don\u0027t bitch about how the car smells later, because I want chili and onions.\"\n \"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\n \"Cadaver dogs. You were saying we should go to the ballpark and get cadaver dogs for lunch.\"\n \"I was saying no such thing. I was saying we should get a dog that\u0027s trained to sniff out cadavers to help us find the clothing of the victims.\"\n \"Oh,\" said Cavuto, who didn\u0027t want to think about vampires. \"Sure, that makes sense. So, Barney\u0027s Burgers for lunch then?\"\n \"You buy,\" Rivera said, as he popped the locks on the unmarked Ford and climbed in.\n They drove eight blocks down Fillmore Street toward the Marina, before Cavuto said, \"She\u0027s right, you know? I am a bear.\"\n Rivera put on his sunglasses and took a few seconds adjusting them on his face to buy time before he answered with a sigh. \"I\u0027m glad you decided to come clean about that, Nick, because observing your six-foot-three-inch, two-hundred-and-sixty-pound, growling gay personage for the last fourteen years would have never betrayed your true identity, given my dull, homicide detective powers of observation.\"\n \"Your sarcasm is the main reason Alice left you.\"\n \"Really?\" Rivera had wondered. Alice had said because he was too much of a cop and not enough of a husband, but he had suspicions about her testimony.\n \"No, but I\u0027m sure it was on the list.\"\n \"Nick, in all our time as partners, have I ever indicated that I wanted to discuss your sexuality?\"\n \"Well, not beyond using it to threaten suspects.\"\n \"And have I ever offered to share the details of my sex life with Alice?\"\n \"I just assumed you didn\u0027t have one.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s not really relevant. I\u0027m just saying, I\u0027m fine with you just the way you are.\"\n \"Mantastic, you mean?\"\n \"Sure, go with that. Although I was thinking more of large and furry, yet afraid of tiny girls.\"\n \"Well, you can\u0027t hit her, she\u0027s a kid,\" Cavuto whined.\n They found parking in a garage near Barney\u0027s. Rivera pulled into a no-parking spot (because he could) and shut off the engine. He sat back and looked at the wall in front of them.\n \"So, vampire cats,\" Cavuto said.\n \"Yeah,\" said Rivera.\n \"We\u0027re fucked,\" said the big cop.\n \"Yeah,\" said Rivera. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bite-me-a-love-story-a-love-story-3/page-5.html","bookId":2044,"book":{"id":2044,"title":"Bite Me: A Love Story (A Love Story #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The city of San Francisco is being stalked by a huge shaved vampyre cat named Chet, and only I, Abby Normal, emergency backup mistress of the Greater Bay Area night, and my manga-haired love monkey, Foo Dog, stand between the ravenous monster and a bloody massacre of the general public.
