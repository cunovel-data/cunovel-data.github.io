{"id":109689,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"19. Being the Chronicles of Abby Normal: Oh Day Dwellers Doth Betray Me?\\n\\n My heart has been torn asunder, and I am faced with the revelation that my most awesome-haired mad scientist of passion may in fact be an uncaring assbag who has sullied my innocence and whatnot and then cruelly cast me aside. So, that sucks.\\n\\n \u0027Kayso, like it says in the Bible, \"with great power, comes great responsibility,\" which I totally learned by pushing my vamp abilities too far in trying to show off for Foo by diving through our boarded-up windows. So I was \"doh,\" and I passed out-real passed out, like head-injury passed out, not vampyre passed out. But in my unconsciousness, Foo and Jared gave me blood, and I healed, so when I woke up in the bedroom, I came leaping out into the living area, my claws ready to rend flesh and kick ass.\\n\\n And I was all, \"Rawr!\"\\n\\n And who do I see there but the vampyre Flood, my most recently escaped master gone mad, who has never even seen me in this outfit, let alone as a vamp.\\n\\n So I was all, \"Rawr!\" hoping my fangs were showing.\\n\\n And he was all, \"Hi, Abby.\"\\n\\n And I was all, \"Rawr! Fear me!\"\\n\\n And he was all, \"That\u0027s not a thing. Saying rawr is not a vampyre thing.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"It is too. I\u0027m totally showing my animal power and fierceness.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s like, \"No, you\u0027re not, you\u0027re just saying rawr in a big voice. It\u0027s not a thing.\"\\n\\n \"It could be a thing,\" I go, in my defense.\\n\\n And Jared is like, \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a thing, Abs.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Well then how about I drain you until you\u0027re dust and put you in the cat box, Jared? Is that a vampyre thing?\"\\n\\n And he was all, \"\u0027Kay. I\u0027m sorry. Rawr is totally a thing.\"\\n\\n So I looked at Flood with pity, having humiliated him on the field of battle. But it is in the gentler monster that humanity is revealed, so I\u0027m like, \"It\u0027s a thing for some of us. So, check it, I\u0027m nossssss-feratu. Like you, only, you know, not fashion retarded. Speaking of, why do you look like the window at Banana Republic?\" Flood was always sort of jeans and flannel before, like he was caught in some \u002790s grunge vortex, but now he was like linen and tan leather.\\n\\n And Flood\u0027s like, \"I was running around the streets naked until a few hours ago.\"\\n\\n And I was like, \"\u0027Kay. My bad.\"\\n\\n So he\u0027s all, \"Abby, we need to go. I need to find Jody and I need your help.\"\\n\\n And then Foo, who has been doing science stuff in the kitchen, comes over and he\u0027s like, \"Abby, I can switch you back. I can switch you both back. I already have Tommy\u0027s serum made from before.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"You are tr��s cute when you\u0027re threatened.\" And I jump over there and kiss him deeply-like I can hear a couple of his vertebrae crack. But then I go to slap him, so he won\u0027t think I\u0027m a slut, and Tommy catches my hand.\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"Abby, you have to stop doing that. You could kill him.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m like, \"Really?\"\\n\\n He\u0027s all nodding. And Foo\u0027s all mouthing \"thank you\" to him, like I don\u0027t have vampyre hearing and don\u0027t know that he\u0027s being a total little bitch about it. So I, like, turn on Foo and go, \"Rawr.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t care what Tommy says, Foo trembled in fear.\\n\\n And Tommy\u0027s like, \"Let\u0027s go, Abby.\" Like Foo hasn\u0027t said a word.\\n\\n And I grab my Pirate Bunny messenger bag and start to pack in my laptop and charger, and Flood is all, \"Leave that here.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"How will I express my angst and dark inspirations and whatnot?\"\\n\\n And Flood is like, \"I thought we\u0027d go suck the blood out of some people.\"\\n\\n And I was like, \"\u0027Kay, but I\u0027m still taking my laptop. I have to do my blog. I have subscribers.\" I do. Well, a subscriber.\\n\\n And he\u0027s like, \"If we have to go to mist you\u0027ll lose it.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"You don\u0027t know how to do that.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"I do now.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Teach me. I didn\u0027t go to ancient evil vampyre school like you.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s like, \"I\u0027m nineteen, remember? I went to public school. In Indiana.\"\\n\\n And Foo\u0027s like, \"You\u0027re only nineteen? You\u0027re not even old enough to drink?\"\\n\\n And Jared is like, \"Shut up. He\u0027s her dark lord. Our dark lord.\"\\n\\n And Foo\u0027s like, \"Fine. Go. Be careful. Text me. I\u0027ll be here trying to save the world.\"\\n\\n And Tommy\u0027s all, \"I\u0027m just going to try to save the woman I love, and that\u0027s as good as the world to me.\"\\n\\n And I was like-nothing. I just looked at Tommy. But I would have done him on a bed of carpet tacks right then.\\n\\n So outside the love lair, which is technically not mine and Foo\u0027s anymore, now that the rightful owners are not imprisoned in bronze, I go, \"So, where do we start?\"\\n\\n And Flood is all, \"We start by finding a safe place to sleep during the day.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"The love lair. Foo and Jared will be our minions and whatnot.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s like, \"The last time I went out there I woke up inside a statue, and the last time you were up there your love ninja gave you blood with a sedative.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"No.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Foo, you crapacious little geek! Can I go slap him around a little?\"\\n\\n And Flood is all, \"He was going to change you back. To save you.\"\\n\\n And I go, \"Without even asking? I think not, noble vamptard. As soon as we find the Countess I\u0027m coming back. There will be screaming.\"\\n\\n And Flood\u0027s like, \"You don\u0027t have any confrontation issues, do you?\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"No, I\u0027m very insecure, actually, but I have found that if you roll up screaming like a madwoman, hair on fire, guns blazing, no one is going to mention the zit on your forehead.\" Which is totally true.\\n\\n \"Okey dokey,\" goes the vampyre Flood. \"We\u0027ll look for someplace low or high. Low is probably safest, we can look for maintenance closets in the BART tunnels, but that keeps us out of the north end of the City, because there\u0027s no subway there. High, harder to find a place, but it gives us more choice, and it\u0027s less obvious, if Rivera and Cavuto are looking for us. There are a lot of utility sheds and meter shelters on roofs.\"\\n\\n So I\u0027m like, \"Are we going to sleep together?\"\\n\\n And Flood\u0027s like, \"No, but we\u0027ll be dead in the same space.\"\\n\\n And I was thinking, \"How romantic,\" but I go, \"Let\u0027s get high.\"\\n\\n And Tommy\u0027s all, \"I think that\u0027s a good idea. Jody lived in the north end of the City and so did I. It makes sense that\u0027s where she\u0027d go. We need to get into the upper floors of a tall building and look down on other roofs, look for a shed or something. Climbing up won\u0027t be a problem. You can tell if there\u0027s people in it by looking for heat. You know you can see heat now, right?\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"I was figuring that it was that or that every lightbulb was leaking into the sky. But how do you know all this other stuff?\"\\n\\n And Tommy\u0027s like, \"I have no idea.\"\\n\\n And I was like, \"If we find a roof shack with a pigeon coop by it we\u0027ll have snacks when we wake up.\" I know, perky. I must resist the perky. Must resist the perky.\\n\\n So, like, an hour later we\u0027ve found our sweet roof grave on a building in the financial district, and Flood and I are walking up Powell Street, toward California and the Fairmont, where the Countess was last seen. And we are totally alive with the night. There\u0027s like two cities in the City. I didn\u0027t see it before. There\u0027s like the indoor city, the daytime city, with people inside of apartments and restaurants and offices, and they have, like, no fucking clue about the outside city. And there\u0027s the outside city people, who are in the streets all the time, and who know every hiding place, and every tree, and where it\u0027s dangerous, and where it\u0027s just creepy. The outside city people live on, like, a different plane of existence, like they don\u0027t even see the inside people either. But when you\u0027re a vampyre, the two cities are all lit up. You can hear the people talking and eating and watching TV in their houses, and you can see and feel the people in the streets, behind the garbage cans, under the stairs. All these auras show, sometimes right through walls. Like life, glowing. Some bright pink, like Foo\u0027s, some sort of brown, or gray, like on the AIDS vet panhandling at the corner of Powell and Post. And I\u0027m totally losing my ability to appear bored, because it\u0027s fucking awesome. I\u0027m trying to be chill for Flood, but I want to know.\\n\\n So I\u0027m like, \"What\u0027s with the pink ring around people?\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s like, \"It\u0027s their life force. You can tell how healthy they are by it. You\u0027ll be able to smell if they\u0027re dying, too, but you won\u0027t know that right away.\"\\n\\n I know, whoa. So I\u0027m like, \"Whoa.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"You see it for a reason.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"\u0027Splain, s\u0027il vous pla\u0026icirc;t.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"Because you\u0027re only supposed to take the sick, the dying. It\u0027s part of our predator nature. I didn\u0027t know that before I-I was lost, but I know it now.\"\\n\\n I know, whoa. So I\u0027m like, \"Okay, how do you turn to mist?\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s like, \"It\u0027s mental. Completely. You can\u0027t think about it, you just have to be.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"You\u0027re fucking with me, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"No, if you think, it doesn\u0027t work. You have to just be. Words get in the way. I think that\u0027s why the cats do it instinctively. That\u0027s the key. Instinct. I don\u0027t function well on instinct. I\u0027m a word guy.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"I\u0027m a word guy, too,\" like a total dwee-bosaurus. I know. How is it that I, acting Mistress of the Greater Bay Area darkness, can be reduced to spewing nano-brained beauty-queen dialog when I should be enjoying the heady power of my vamp immortality? Simple, I am a romance slut, and there\u0027s nothing I can do about it. If a guy does or says something romantic, I\u0027m all, \"Oh, please excuse me, kind, sir, let me dial down my IQ and oh, if it would please sir, may I offer you this moist, yet helpless va-jay-jay that seems to have lost its way.\" I was clearly born in the wrong time. I should have been born in Wuthering Heights times. Although if I was Cathy, I would have hunted down that Heathcliff guy and beat him with a riding crop like a sado-hooker with his Black Card on file. Just sayin\u0027.\\n\\n So there\u0027s nothing at the Fairmont. We talk to the bellman and the guy at the concierge desk, who talks to the front-desk guy who says that he\u0027s not at liberty to talk about guests, when I whip a hundred-dollar bill on him and he says \"the redhead\" never showed up again after the day the cops came around asking for her. He said the cops took a cooler from her room.\\n\\n And Tommy\u0027s like, \"She just vanished.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Do you want to get coffee? I have a bag of blood and ten thousand dollars in my messenger.\" The nosferatu can totally drink lattes as long as they put some blood in it, unless they\u0027re lactose intolerant.\\n\\n And he stops and looks at me. He\u0027s like, \"Really, ten thousand? Think that will be enough?\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Well, you\u0027ll have to drink the cheap stuff, but I like to drink my lattes directly out of the veins of a toddler, and those little fuckers aren\u0027t cheap.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s like, \"Okay, you just completely creeped me out.\"\\n\\n So I\u0027m all, \"You suck at this. Let\u0027s go get coffee and do some vamp stuff, like beat up some pimps and whatnot.\"\\n\\n \"Since when is beating up pimps a vampyre thing?\"\\n\\n \"Since I was looking for the Countess and they kept trying to recruit me because I\u0027m am so awesome sexy that desperate losers will totally pay to do me, which is flattering and whatnot, but I still kind of feel like they would have taken advantage of me because of my youth and naivety.\"\\n\\n \"So you want to go beat them up.\"\\n\\n \"I want to try that kung-fu thing where you tear their heart out and show it to them while it\u0027s still beating. Tr��s macabre, non? Plus, I\u0027ll bet the look of surprise on their faces will be worth it. Did you do that when you were out slaughtering people with Chet?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember any of that. I don\u0027t remember slaughtering people.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why the pimps were trying to recruit me. You and Chet ate all their hos.\"\\n\\n \"You make it sound so sordid.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, you make eating hos sound pretty. Talk poetry to me, writer boy.\"\\n\\n And he looks all heartbroken and whatnot. And he\u0027s like, \"That\u0027s what Jody calls me.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Sorry. Where do you want to look for her now?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. What time is it?\"\\n\\n And I look at the watch that the Countess gave me, and I\u0027m all, \"A little after one,\" in my I am total poop on a stick voice.\\n\\n \" Polk Street.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \" Why Polk Street?\"\\n\\n He\u0027s like, \"Because I\u0027m out of ideas and we need to resort to magic.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Sweet! Let\u0027s rock the dark magic!\" I was tempted to do a booty dance of total dark magic celebration, but I thought it might reveal my secret.\\n\\n \u0027Kayso, we roll into this coffee shop on Polk Street, and it\u0027s all full of hippies and hipsters and couples on dates and drunks sobering up and whatnot. And everyone turns and looks at us. I\u0027m about to chuck a spaz, because I realize that I haven\u0027t fixed my makeup since I bounced my face off the plywood in the love lair.\\n\\n So I\u0027m all, \"Tommy, psssssst, do I look like a cannibal corpse on crack?\"\\n\\n And he stops and looks at me for a second, and he\u0027s like, \"No more than usual.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Do I have raccoon eyes?\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s like, \"You\u0027ve kind of taken your broken clown look to the next level, with the crusted blood around your mouth. You look cute.\"\\n\\n Flood can be very sweet for a doofus from Indiana. I felt like I had made the right decision to choose him to be my Dark Lord, even if he was only nineteen instead of five hundred.\\n\\n So I feel like I should say something nice back, so I\u0027m like, \"You\u0027re not as pathetic in those clothes.\" Then I realize that didn\u0027t sound as nice as I liked, so I\u0027m all, \"I want a triple soy latte with type O in it while we\u0027re waiting for magic and whatnot.\"\\n\\n And Flood is all, \"She\u0027s here.\"\\n\\n I know. I\u0027m like, \"Whaaaa?\"\\n\\n \u0027Kayso, Flood sends me for coffees and says he\u0027ll meet me at a table in the back, so when I show up, he\u0027s sitting with this ginormously fat gay guy, wearing a purple silk wizard robe with silver stars and moons on it, and his head is shaved and there\u0027s a pentagram tattooed on it, just like I drew on Ronnie\u0027s head with a Magic Marker. I know! And he has a crystal ball on his table on a stand made out of dragons, and a sign that says MADAME NATASHA, FORTUNES TOLD $5.00, ALL PROCEEDS GO TO AIDS RESEARCH.\\n\\n And so I come up and Flood is all, \"Madame Natasha, this is my minion, Abby Normal.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Enchant��,\" in, like, perfect fucking French. \"Most fly eye-liner, Madame.\" He had like spider fake lashes and glitter liner out to his ears.\\n\\n And Madame Natasha is all, \"Oh, sweet of you to say, child. Your ensem is tr��s chic as well. But you should have a jacket, little thing like you could freeze in the fog.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all ready to throw down anti-mom you\u0027re-not-the-boss-of-me-talk on him, then I\u0027m kinda okay with it. Like maybe I would get along with the Motherbot better if she were a ginormous gay guy.\\n\\n And I sit down next to Madame Natasha, because Flood is, like, in the client seat, and Flood\u0027s all, \"Madame Natasha told my fortune when I first came to town, and said that I would meet a girl, but the death card kept coming up, so she couldn\u0027t figure it out.\" Then he turns to Madame and is like, \"You were right on the money, I ended up meeting a dead girl.\"\\n\\n And Madame\u0027s all, \"Oh my,\" and she pulls this little fan out of one of her chins and starts fanning herself.\\n\\n \u0027Kayso, I pull out the bag of blood and squeeze a little into my coffee, then into Flood\u0027s, and he\u0027s all, \"Abby, put that away.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Why?\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all nodding toward people, who are totally not looking at us now, but like really reading or texting hard. And he\u0027s like, \"They\u0027ll freak.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Oh bitch, please. They all saw my eye makeup, they saw how I\u0027m dressed, they saw my dark and mysteriously colored hair, and they think I\u0027m just trying to freak them out by pretending to pour blood in my coffee. So they are all furiously not freaking out so as to not give me the satisfaction because then they wouldn\u0027t be sophisticated City peeps. This is not my first funeral, Red State.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I like her,\" goes the Madame. \"She\u0027s got spunk.\"\\n\\n And Flood is like, \"Okey dokey.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"If you keep saying \u0027okey dokey\u0027 I will be forced to replace you as my Dark Lord.\"\\n\\n And Madame is all, \"It does sound a little corn-fed, love.\"\\n\\n And Tommy is all, \"Never mind how I talk. You remember, right, Madame? You remember me?\"\\n\\n And the Madame is all \"Oh, yes, yes, I do now. You were the one who had achieved Olympic levels in masturbation, weren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n And Flood was all, \"Uh, no, that part was someone else, uh-\"\\n\\n So, like, the master needed a hand, if you know what I mean, so I was like, \"Oh chill, it\u0027s a stress thing, everyone does it. I\u0027m flicking the bean under the table right now just to dial the tension back a little. Yes. Yes. Yes! Oh-zombie-jeebus-fuck-me-Simba-lion-king-hakuna-matata! Yes!\" So I spaz-gasmed a little and kind of slid down in my seat breathing hard. Then I like look up at the Madame with one eye and I\u0027m like, \"They\u0027re freaking out now, aren\u0027t they?\"\\n\\n And she just kind of nodded with big eyes and whatnot. So, you know, embarrassment for my Dark Lord totally diverted. But this one crusty day dweller is all looking up from his Wall Street Journal at me with a disgusted face, so I\u0027m all, \"Rawr.\"\\n\\n And Flood looks at me.\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Shut up, it\u0027s a thing. He shouldn\u0027t even be allowed out at night, using my dark without permission.\" So I rawred Wall Street again for eavesdropping.\\n\\n So we sort of drank our coffee for a while and Madame looked at her cards and then, like, looked up seemed disappointed that we were still there, but Flood was on it.\\n\\n He\u0027s all, \"The woman you told me I would meet, I met her. We live together.\"\\n\\n And the Madame holds up her hand, which means, \"shut the fuck up\" in fortune-teller language. And she looks at her cards some more. Then she looks at her tip jar.\\n\\n Then Flood looks at me and like does the tip jar nod. So I pull a hundred out of my messenger bag and drop it in the jar.\\n\\n And Flood\u0027s like, \"Abby!\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Hello, woman you love? You want to bargain hunt?\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"\u0027Kay.\"\\n\\n So Madame Natasha puts down a few more cards, and goes, \"A redhead.\"\\n\\n And we\u0027re all, \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s all, \"She\u0027s hurt, but she\u0027s not alone.\"\\n\\n And we\u0027re all, \"Uh-huh.\"\\n\\n And she lays out about six more cards, and she goes, \"That can\u0027t be right.\"\\n\\n And Flood is like, \"If you\u0027re getting the dead thing again, that\u0027s okay, we\u0027ve worked through that.\"\\n\\n And Madame is like, \"No, it\u0027s not that.\" And she shuffles the cards, not cool, like a dealer, but gentle, and every which way on the table, like she\u0027s really trying to confuse the cards.\\n\\n Then she lays them out again. And her eyes are getting bigger as she goes-each card, bigger eyes-until she lays down the last in her pattern and she\u0027s all, \"Oh my.\"\\n\\n And we\u0027re all, \"What? What?\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s, \"This has never happened, in thirty years of consulting the cards.\"\\n\\n And we\u0027re, \"What? What?\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s, \"Look.\"\\n\\n There were fourteen cards on the table. All kinds of pictures and numbers. And I\u0027m like, ready to go, \"\u0027Splain, please.\" But then I see what she\u0027s big eyes about. They are all the same suit. So I\u0027m, \"They\u0027re all swords.\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s like, \"Yes. I\u0027m not sure how to even interpret this.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"She\u0027s hurt, she\u0027s not alone, and all the cards came up swords?\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s, \"Yes, dear, that\u0027s what I just said, but I don\u0027t know what it means.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m, \"I do. Can you do them again?\" And I slap another hundred in her jar.\\n\\n And she\u0027s, \"\u0027Kay.\"\\n\\n Then she lays them all out again, and this time there\u0027s a lot of swords, but also other cards. And I\u0027m, \"Well?\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s all, \"In this configuration, the swords signify north, but also, the air, a sailing ship perhaps. It doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\\n\\n And we\u0027re like, \"What? What?\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s like, \"A sunken ship?\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"It makes total sense.\"\\n\\n And Flood is like, \"It does?\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Stay right there, Madame. We may be back.\"\\n\\n And Flood is like, \"What? What?\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"I forgot to tell you about the little guy with the sword.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s like, \"You really adjust to this magical stuff fast, Abby.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Are you trying to say I\u0027m perky? Because I\u0027m not. I\u0027m complex.\"\\n\\n I am. Shut up, I am.\\n\\n He\u0027s looking at me right now, like we should be going. Even though I am typing at awesome speed. Okay, that\u0027s it, dude, you\u0027re harshing the depth out of my literature. I\u0027m coming. What a whiner. Gotta go. We\u0027re going to run out of dark. Byez.\\n\\n THE OLD ONES\\n\\n Makeda put on the glasses and watched the bricks at the corner of the building light up. They\u0027d find the cats by behavior, because even vampire cats are cats, and they marked their territory. Elijah had told them where it had started and where it was likely to move. The special sunglasses, combined with their vampire vision, allowed them to see the phosphorus expelled in the cats\u0027 urine as glowing. They could even see a half-life, of sorts. Something marked days ago would glow much dimmer than something marked only a few hours ago.\\n\\n \"That way,\" said Makeda.\\n\\n Rolf cocked his head toward the boarded-up loft apartment on the second floor. \"That\u0027s the loft where Elijah said he turned the first cat. There are people up there. Sounds like two.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s also where he was fried by a jacket covered with sun lights,\" said Makeda. \"I say we clean up the cats first, they\u0027re less tricky.\"\\n\\n Rolf nodded to Makeda, who bolted down the alley without another word. They followed the trail, a mark here and there, many blocks until they reached the Mission, where the trail started to sunburst out.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know which way to go,\" said Bella. \"We need to get a vantage point.\"\\n\\n Rolf looked around and spotted the tallest building in the area. \"How about that one, the one that looks like a robot pterodactyl is perched on it? He pointed to the black glass Federal Building.\\n\\n Makeda said, \"It\u0027s an abomination.\"\\n\\n \"Said the abomination,\" snarked Rolf. \"I\u0027ll go. I have to go up solid, I need the glasses.\" He shrugged off his overcoat and dropped his weapons on top of it.\\n\\n \"Well go to mist if you lose your grip,\" said Makeda. \"I\u0027ll catch your glasses. If you fall off of that thing solid we\u0027ll have to scrape you into a bag to get you back to the ship.\"\\n\\n He grinned, showing his fangs, then started a steady climb up the sheer corner of the building.\\n\\n Bella pulled a pack of cigarettes from her jacket, shook one out, lit it, then blew a long stream of smoke up after Rolf. \"What if Elijah lied about turning more humans? He\u0027s lied before.\"\\n\\n When they\u0027d retrieved the old vampire from the City initially he\u0027d brought along a blond vampire woman, claiming she was the only one. She hadn\u0027t survived the first month at sea. Weak vessels, they called her type.\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t admit turning the cat, either, until we found the news stories on the Internet.\"\\n\\n \"We need to talk to him again when we get back to the ship, if there\u0027s time.\"\\n\\n Rolf thumped to the pavement beside them. \"That way. About six blocks. There\u0027s a sunburst pattern that\u0027s centered there and spreads out ten blocks or so in every direction. I could actually see a hundred or so cats on a roof there.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go, then,\" said Makeda.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not all,\" said Rolf. \"There is a group of men hunting them. Eight of them.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know they\u0027re hunting the cats?\"\\n\\n \"Because two of them lit up their coats. If I hadn\u0027t been wearing the glasses I\u0027d be blind. They\u0027re wearing the sun jackets that Elijah warned us about.\"\\n\\n \"Well, fuck,\" said Makeda. \"That\u0027s eight more we have to kill.\"\\n\\n \"At least,\" said Rolf. \"How much time before daylight?\"\\n\\n \"Two and a half hours,\" said Bella, checking her watch. \"Don\u0027t we have a sniper rifle on the ship?\"\\n\\n \"Somewhere,\" said Rolf.\\n\\n \"Well, they can\u0027t turn on a sun jacket if they\u0027re dead before we\u0027re within five hundred yards.\"\\n\\n \"Messy,\" said Makeda. \"Bullets leave bodies.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather have to dispose of a couple of bodies than get fried by a sun jacket,\" said Bella, taking charge now. \"Rolf, you and I will go after the cats. Take out as many as we can. Makeda, follow the hunters, keep your distance, see where they go, and meet us back at the ship. Tonight cats. Tomorrow night, humans.\"\\n\\n \"I hate cats,\" said Makeda.\\n\\n \"I know,\" said Bella.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s something else,\" said Rolf. \"There was something else on the roof with the cats. Something bigger.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean \u0027something\u0027?\" asked Makeda.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Rolf, \"but it wasn\u0027t putting out any heat, so it\u0027s one of us.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bite-me-a-love-story-a-love-story-3/page-18.html","bookId":2044,"book":{"id":2044,"title":"Bite Me: A Love Story (A Love Story #3)","description":"Storyline: The city of San Francisco is being stalked by a huge shaved vampyre cat named Chet, and only I, Abby Normal, emergency backup mistress of the Greater Bay Area night, and my manga-haired love monkey, Foo Dog, stand between the ravenous monster and a bloody massacre of the general public.
