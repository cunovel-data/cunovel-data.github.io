{"id":109691,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"21. Being the Chronicles of Abby Normal: The Mopey Monosexuality of an Outcast Cutie Corpse\n Much like the guy in Herman Hesse\u0027s novel Steppenwolf (which everyone knows means, \"wolf going up the steps\") who runs into the ENTRANCE NOT FOR EVERYBODY sign outside of the Magic Theater, when it comes to romance, I am definitely not on the list. Loneliness is my \"plus one.\" Bitterness is my boo.\n Oh, it was sweet waking up at sundown, nearly in the arms of my Dark Lord, snuggled up in our utility shed on the roof. I probably shouldn\u0027t have snatched that pigeon out from under the eave and sort of sucked its little throat, but in my defense, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and I swore off anything with feathers because they are nasty. Still, I think Lord Flood would have forgiven me spitting bloody feathers on his linen trousers if my tail hadn\u0027t harshed our search plan.\n There, now everyone knows. I have a tail. Which is kinda the reason we had to return to the love lair instead of continuing our search for the Countess. Foo called just before sunup to say that all the rats had died.\n So I\u0027m like, \"Non sequitur much, Foo? If you miss me, you can just apologize and grovel a little and we\u0027ll move on.\"\n And he\u0027s like, \"No, Abby, you don\u0027t understand. There\u0027s something in their DNA, they just sort of expire after a week or so of being a vampyre.\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"My poor, sad Foo Dog, are you sure that your mantenna isn\u0027t just using dead rats to send an S.O.S. for a return to tuna town? Hmmmm?\"\n And he\u0027s all, \"No, Abby, you have rat DNA tied in with your vampirism, the same way Chet has human DNA.\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"Nuh-uh.\"\n And he\u0027s all, \"You have to come back here. Abby, I know you have a tail.\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"Fucksocks,\" and I offed my phone.\n So when Flood and I come to in the shed on the roof, I\u0027m like, \"We may need to check in with Foo.\"\n And Flood is like, \"Call him and tell him that there are old vampyres here to clean up. He needs to be ready. We\u0027ll be there in a few minutes.\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"I\u0027ll text him. I\u0027m not speaking to him right now.\"\n So, like, Tommy showed me how you couldn\u0027t run too fast, or someone would notice something was up, so you had to sort of go in bursts and I wasn\u0027t supposed to jump over cars and whatnot because that shit is a dead giveaway that you are nosferatu. Although I did \"rawr\" some tourists on the cable car, because they needed it. And if you ask them they will all be, \"She was tr��s scary, and back in Cowfuck, Nebraska, we know that \u0027rawr\u0027 is totally a thing because we have family values and whatnot.\"\n So after running in bursts for like three blocks I rawred down a cab that was halted by my awesome dark powers and the hundred-dollar bill I was waving, and we rode to the love lair, where Jared let us in.\n And Jared was all, \"OMG, OMG, OMFG, Abs, the rats are dead!\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"Not news. Awesome vamp robot pirate ship, equals news.\"\n And Jared is like, \"For realz?\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"Totes.\"\n And he kind of does a gayboy squee that was a little embarrassing, so I\u0027m all, \"Where\u0027s Foo?\"\n And Foo comes out of the bedroom and I go to kiss him and he sort of stops and holds up his little blood vials, like, \"Oh, no kisses, Abby, I have breakables.\" So I backed off.\n And he\u0027s like, \"Abby we need to change you back. Right away.\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"No way, Foo. I am finished with your petty human weakness.\"\n And he like waves to all the rat boxes, and all the rats are just lying in the bottom of them. And I\u0027m all, \"So?\"\n And Foo\u0027s like, \"They just dropped, within hours of each other. There\u0027s some incompatibility with the vampyre virus.\"\n \"It\u0027s a virus?\" goes Tommy.\n And Foo\u0027s all, \"I don\u0027t know exactly what it is, but it binds to the host DNA and it carries the DNA to the infected.\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"So?\"\n And that\u0027s when Foo blurts out that I have a tail to Flood, and I just want to crawl in a hole and die, except for it being redundant.\n Then Jared\u0027s like, \"Would you guys like something to drink? Some blood or something?\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"No thanks, I had a pigeon.\"\n And Flood is like, \"Yes, I\u0027ll have some.\"\n And he\u0027s about to take a sip from a wineglass that Jared poured, and I see his fangs, which are tr��s sexy now that he\u0027s not ripping my throat out with them, and he\u0027s like, \"Oh, Abby, if this turns out to be drugged, tear Steve\u0027s arms off.\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"\u0027Kay,\" then to Foo, I\u0027m like, \"Rawr. Shut up.\"\n And Foo\u0027s like, \"It\u0027s not drugged.\"\n So we tell Foo and Jared about the ship and the old vampyres and how they are here to clean house, and about what the Kona guy said about second generation vampyres.\n And Foo\u0027s like, \"That\u0027s you, Tommy.\"\n And Flood is like, \"I know. I have to find Jody. And you and Jared need to get away from this apartment. Go somewhere, stay until you hear it\u0027s all clear or the Raven leaves.\"\n And Foo is like, \"How did you think to go to the dock anyway?\"\n So we told him about Madame Natasha and the sunken ship in the north end of the City and whatnot, and he\u0027s all rolling his eyes, because he doesn\u0027t believe in magic, despite the fact that he\u0027s rolling his eyes at two vampyres.\n And he\u0027s like, \"Did you try the Sunken Ship?\"\n And we\u0027re like, \"Whaaaa?\"\n And he\u0027s like, \"It\u0027s a bar down on Jackson Street. It was built on top of one of the Gold Rush ships that was abandoned there. You can still see the ribs of the ship in the basement.\"\n And Flood\u0027s like, \"The Sunken Ship? That\u0027s what it\u0027s called?\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"Kind of obvious.\"\n And Flood\u0027s like, \"We need to go there.\"\n And Foo\u0027s all, \"No, I have to change you both back. You could drop any minute.\"\n So I go, \"As if. We have to find the Countess.\"\n And Tommy\u0027s all, \"After. All that after.\"\n So Foo goes, \"Well, then take these.\" And he gives Flood and me each a thing that looks like an aluminum flashlight with a blue glass erection.\n And I\u0027m all, \"Uh, we can see in the dark, and heat, and we have someone on retainer who can see into the future, so, thanks, but...\"\n \"They\u0027re UV lasers,\" goes Foo, in the middle of my dismissal. \"They use them to fuse UV sensitive polymers in vacuum chambers.\"\n And Tommy looks at me like, \"What?\" And I look at him like, \"No fucking idea.\"\n So Foo runs on like, \"They would just burn me or Jared if you held it on us, like a high-intensity sunlamp. But you\u0027d have to hold it there for about five seconds.\"\n So Flood looks at me like, \"What?\" And I look at him like, \"I got nothing.\"\n So Foo takes Tommy\u0027s flashlight from him and he goes, \"Like this.\" And he points the flashlight at one of the dead rat boxes and it busts out with this intense blue beam and whoosh instant rat charcoal.\n So Flood and I are like, \"Oh.\"\n \"You can\u0027t just leave them on like the UV jackets. They work with a capacitor that builds a charge and lets go with a two-second burst, but you can probably cut a vamp in half in that time. I made them for Rivera and Cavuto.\"\n And Tommy goes, \"Well don\u0027t give one to them, for fuck\u0027s sake, they\u0027re hunting me and Jody.\"\n \"And me,\" I go.\n \"And me,\" goes Jared. And we look at him. And he goes, \"Not because I\u0027m a vampyre. Because that big cop hates me.\" Then he looked embarrassed and he goes, \"Hey, you guys, your eyes are bleeding.\"\n And I look at Tommy and I\u0027m all, \"WTF?\"\n And Foo\u0027s like, \"You guys should probably wear sun-glasses with UV filtering if you\u0027re going to use those, or, you know, they could hurt your eyes.\"\n So Flood\u0027s like, \"Good to know.\"\n And Foo\u0027s like, \"You should know that they can\u0027t go to mist if they\u0027re hurt or under exposure to any significant UV. I tested it with the rats. Which means you can\u0027t either.\"\n And we\u0027re all, \"Uh-huh.\"\n And he\u0027s like, \"What will you do?\"\n And Flood is like, \"We\u0027re going to the Sunken Ship and see if we can find Jody, and then I guess we\u0027re going to see if we can get on a pirate ship. What about you?\"\n \"I have to break the lab down first, but I know some guys in my program at Berkeley that have an extra room. I can stay there.\"\n And Flood is like, \"Take Jared with you. Elijah saw him. Anyone Elijah knows or who knew about him is in danger.\"\n And Jared is all, \"Nooooo, Berkeley is way too butch.\"\n So I \u0027splain to Tommy, \"Jared is afraid of butch lesbians. They were invented in Berkeley.\"\n And Foo is like looking at Jared, and looking at me, and looking at Flood, and looking at his dead rats, and he\u0027s all, \"Can\u0027t you at least leave Abby here and let me change her back?\"\n And Flood looks at me and I\u0027m all, \"Bitch, please, I have a light sabre.\" And I grabbed Foo and kissed him hard, but I could feel him pulling away.\n And he\u0027s like, \"Abby, after this is over-\"\n And I\u0027m like, finger on his lips, \"Shh, shh, shh, Foo. Do not awkwardize the moment with sniveling. I\u0027ve been preparing my whole life for this.\"\n And I have.\n So we jammed.\n And outside Flood is like, \"You okay?\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"Yeah. Do you think I\u0027m a freak because I have a tail?\"\n And he\u0027s all, \"No, not because of that.\"\n Which was awesome for him to say.\n So we did the low-profile walk to Walgreens, where we bought three pairs of sunglasses and a disposable cell phone for Tommy and I got some Gummi bears, which I am dipping in blood and eating now-biting off their little bear heads. Then we go over to the financial district and we find the bar called the Sunken Ship on Jackson Street in the old section, and there\u0027s a big picture of a sailing ship, and THE SUNKEN SHIP is carved in big letters, and we\u0027re not two blocks from the roof where we spent the night, and I\u0027m all, \"Oops.\"\n And Flood is like, \"Now what?\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"Don\u0027t you have fake ID?\" I was kind of fucking with him for pretending to be five hundred years old when we first met, when he\u0027s only nineteen.\n And he\u0027s like, \"No, do you?\"\n \"Yeah. Like six of them. I\u0027ll go in and look around.\"\n And he\u0027s like, \"Okay.\"\n So I start to go inside, where all these suits and citizens are, and I hear, \"Hey,\" a girl\u0027s voice. Quiet, but like she knows we can hear.\n And it\u0027s the Countess, palming a door shut on this below-street apartment. And she\u0027s in like black jeans carrying a pair of Nikes, but her hair is all glorious, and in like an instant she\u0027s up over the rail, not even touching the stairs, and in Tommy\u0027s arms. And it was beautiful, and sad, and I felt my heart break, but then it was like leaping for joy, because I really do love the Countess, and I love Tommy, but they love each other, and well-fucksocks.\n So I\u0027m like, \"Cold-faced killers on the clock, bitches, we don\u0027t have time for your bonery right now.\"\n And the Countess like lets Tommy go and gives me a big hug and she\u0027s like, \"So, girl-e-girl, the dead thing, it works for you.\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"Duh.\"\n And she looks at Flood and she\u0027s, \"I\u0027m not sure about the tropical thing though.\"\n And he\u0027s like, \"Abby sprayed pigeon blood on my pants.\"\n And she\u0027s like, \"No, that part\u0027s good.\"\n And he\u0027s like, \"She has a tail.\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"Traitor!\"\n Then she looks all sad, and she\u0027s like, \"Tommy, we need to talk.\"\n And he\u0027s like, \"No, we need to move.\"\n So, while we walk toward the water we explain about the old vamps and the clean up, and the Raven and whatnot.\n \u0027Kayso, now we\u0027re on the roof of the Bay Club, which is a really nice gym across the street from the dock, and we are staking out the Raven, and from up here we can see into the cockpit, which is like the size of a whole apartment. And they\u0027re there. The three of them and Kona, the blond Rasta guy. Two women and a guy. And they\u0027re looking all fly in their black bodysuits and black trench coats and all. But the tall blond guy has something on the table, a long case, and he takes something out and starts putting it together.\n I\u0027m all, \"What\u0027s he got?\"\n \"It\u0027s a rifle,\" goes the Countess.\n WTF? WTF? WTF? I go, \"A gun?\"\n And Tommy goes, \"What\u0027s with the gun?\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"Yeah, guns are for shit on vampyres. Uh, us.\" I still totally don\u0027t want to get shot.\n And Jody\u0027s like, \"They\u0027re not going after vampyres.\"\n And Tommy\u0027s like, \"Abby, would you stop typing. Please?\"\n And I\u0027m like, \"Rawr!\"\n And Jody\u0027s like, \"He\u0027s leaving the ship.\"\n And I\u0027m all, \"WTF?\"\n And Jody\u0027s all, \"We have to follow.\"\n \u0027Kayso, gotta jet. L8erz. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bite-me-a-love-story-a-love-story-3/page-20.html","bookId":2044,"book":{"id":2044,"title":"Bite Me: A Love Story (A Love Story #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The city of San Francisco is being stalked by a huge shaved vampyre cat named Chet, and only I, Abby Normal, emergency backup mistress of the Greater Bay Area night, and my manga-haired love monkey, Foo Dog, stand between the ravenous monster and a bloody massacre of the general public.
