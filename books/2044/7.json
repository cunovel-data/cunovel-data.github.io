{"id":109679,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"8. Being the Chronicles of Abby Normal, in the Double-doomed Doghouse of Despair\\n\\n Do the condemned in hell know the suffering that is a whole day of mom-guilt heaped like steaming piles of bat guano upon my spiky magenta coif? (I went with magenta spikes with electric violet tips to express my outrage at being dragged from my home and imprisoned with the cruel Mombot and my crapacious little sister, Ronnie.) Evidently, Mother feels that we were too young to move in together only a week after meeting, and live in a stolen apartment with two of the undead and their stupid amounts of cash. Although she doesn\u0027t really know about the undead or the cash parts, but she made her point.\\n\\n \u0027Kayso, I had like put on my red tartan wedding gown with the black veil and resolved myself to an all-day power-pout in the corner of the living room, coming up only to text Foo messages of my agony of missing him and change the channel and whatnot, when Jared called from the land-line at the love lair.\\n\\n So I\u0027m all, \"Speak, corpse-fluffer.\"\\n\\n And Jared is all, \"OMFG! The Countess is out, and she was naked, but now she\u0027s not, and she totally got blood all over your leather corset, and you have to come right now because the rats are freaking out and we need a hacksaw and a file.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Uh-oh.\"\\n\\n And Jared is all, \"I know. I know. OMG! OMG!\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Is she pissed?\" Sounding way more chill than I felt.\\n\\n And Jared pauses for a second like he\u0027s thinking it over, then he\u0027s all, \"She\u0027s wearing your clothes and there\u0027s blood running all down the front of her and she\u0027s nodding and showing her fangs and shit.\"\\n\\n So I\u0027m like getting some perspective now-like when you\u0027re a kid and you think it sucks that you have to eat hydrogenated peanut butter on your PBJ, and then you see one of those starving commercial kids with the flies in their eyes, who don\u0027t even have a sandwich-and you\u0027re all, \"Well, that sucks.\" \u0027Kayso, I\u0027m thinking that maybe being under restriction in the mother unit\u0027s Fillmore stronghold isn\u0027t so bad when compared to having the Countess busting out her wrath on you for imprisoning her in bronze.\\n\\n So I\u0027m like, \"Sucks to be you, Jared. Byez.\" And I offed my phone.\\n\\n So like five minutes go by, which I spend in my corner going, \"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,\" and whatnot, and the land-line rings. And Ronnie is all, \"Are you going to get that?\" from her room.\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"I didn\u0027t even know it was hooked up.\"\\n\\n And she was all, \"It\u0027s probably Mom checking up on you, so you might as well get it.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Ronnie, answer it or I will murder you in your sleep and dump your body in the Bay.\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s all, \"\u0027Kay.\"\\n\\n Then, \"It\u0027s for you. It\u0027s some girl named Jody.\" And Ronnie is all standing there with her shaved head and her nonexistent hip thrown out, like \"So there, ho.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Fucksocks!\" And I take the phone and I\u0027m like, \"Hi, I have amnesia and don\u0027t remember anything for the last two months!\" Because what do you say to someone who you had bronzed?\\n\\n And the Countess is all, \"Abby, I\u0027m not angry.\"\\n\\n Which was a total lie, because I could hear that she was angry. She had that \"I\u0027m not angry\" mom voice, even though she\u0027s only, like, twenty-six in real years.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re not going to kill me?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll talk. Right now I need you to get a power drill and a hacksaw with extra blades and come to the loft.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"I don\u0027t know where to get stuff like that, and Foo\u0027s at work, and I\u0027m on restriction, and I have to go to school tomorrow. I have a test, so I totally can\u0027t cut class, and besides, what do you need that stuff for?\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s all, \"Find the tools and come now. Tommy is stuck in the statue and we need to get him out.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m thinking, Oops. But I\u0027m chill and I\u0027m like, \"Can\u0027t he get out the same way you did?\"\\n\\n And the Countess is all, \"Tommy doesn\u0027t know how to turn to mist. That\u0027s how I escaped, but Tommy has been trapped in there for-how long, Abby?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, like a couple of days. It\u0027s all so foggy, after the head trauma.\"\\n\\n Then I hear her saying, like, \"Jared, come over here. I want Abby to hear your neck snap.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, like five weeks. Fuck, Countess, overreact much?\"\\n\\n \"Come now, Abby.\"\\n\\n And she just clicks off.\\n\\n So I text Foo: COUNTESS OUT, NEED HACKSAW PWRDRILL NOW\\n\\n And he\u0027s all: WTF? WTF? WTF? OUT? WTF? ACE HARDWARE, CASTRO ST\\n\\n (I know. Four WTFs! Foo has deep intellectual curiosity. Last week he quizzed me for twenty minutes on what it was like to have a clitoris. I just kept saying \"nice.\" I know, I\u0027m such a tard, I couldn\u0027t think of anything else. I so have to learn French. They have like thirty-seven words for clitoris. They\u0027re like snow to Eskimos, only you know, harder to build an igloo out of.)\\n\\n \u0027Kayso, I text him: KTXBYE \u0026#8249;3\\n\\n And I tell Ronnie to tell Mom that I think I got some anthrax on my toothbrush and I have to go to Walgreens to get a new one so I\u0027ll be right back. Then I put on my jacket with the sun warts, in case of vampyre kitties and whatnot, and I take the F car up to Castro Street and go to Ace Hardware. And I\u0027m totally feeling the animosity coming off the Builder Bob guy in the red apron, and I\u0027m like, \"What? You\u0027ve never seen a wedding dress?\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"No, I love the dress, the jacket, the whole ensem is fabulous.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Really? Thanks. Your apron rocks. I need a hacksaw and a power drill.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"What\u0027s it for?\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"You want a note from my mom? A fucking hacksaw and a power drill. I\u0027m on a schedule.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s all, \"I asked because we have over thirty different kinds of power drills.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Oh. I need to release my Dark Lord from the bronze shell in which I imprisoned him.\"\\n\\n And he\u0027s, \"Oh, you should have said so.\" And he leads me to the drill boutique and I picked out a red and black one that matched my dress, and Bob picked out a hacksaw which totally clashed, but I didn\u0027t want to hurt his feelings, so I said it was tr��s beau, which is French for sweet.\\n\\n \u0027Kayso, as I\u0027m paying for my stuff, I go, \"So, why are you guys still open at midnight?\"\\n\\n And Bob goes, \"Well, you know how it is, you never know when someone is going to need to free their dark lord in the middle of the night, or tie him up.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Ewww.\" Because I do not go for that shit. I am only into S \u0026M and bondage as it applies to wardrobe. I tried cutting myself to express my heartbreak over Tommy (Lord Flood) rejecting me, but OMFG it hurts like flaming fuck. I mean, I\u0027m into self-mutilations as much as the next person-I have eight piercings and five tattoos, some that hurt like double flaming fuck to get, but that was professional, and you can blame someone. In fact, I know a guy in the Haight who will tattoo you for free if you\u0027re a girl and you keep yelling at him the whole time, which, it turns out, isn\u0027t that hard to do when someone is poking you with an electric needle. When he did my bat wings I screamed at him so much I lost my voice for two days.\\n\\n \u0027Kayso, I took the F car across town and the three blocks from Market to the loft, but like holding the button on my sun wart jacket in case I got ambushed by Chet and his vampyre kitty pals, because I totally can\u0027t run in my wedding dress because the buckles of my motocross platforms get caught in the lace, so it\u0027s like, stand and fight or die, bitches! But no vamp kitties came.\\n\\n Anyway, I make it to the loft and I come in all, \"Hey Countess, here\u0027s your drill!\" All Carebear-on-crack-perky, although that might have been a mistake, because it\u0027s a proven fact that it\u0027s easier to murder the perky. And I\u0027m sort of, WTF vampyress? Because she\u0027s not her normal self, which is like hemophiliac hawt, but she\u0027s like printer-paper pale. And I totally ignore the fact that she\u0027s wearing one of my long skirts and my black bustier without even asking, and it\u0027s bustiering her way more than it does me, which is kind of rude. And I\u0027m all, \"Countess, are you okay? You look kind of pale.\"\\n\\n And Jared is all, \"You should have seen her before she drank those blood bags.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m suddenly feeling all poop on a stick, because it\u0027s obvious that she\u0027s all gone snowflake because she\u0027s been locked up without feeding. So I\u0027m like, \"Sorry. I just wanted you guys to be together for eternity, and it didn\u0027t sound like that\u0027s how it was going to happen.\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s like, \"Later, Abby.\" And she just takes the tools from me and goes over to the statue and starts drilling and sawing and whatnot.\\n\\n So I\u0027m like, \"How did you get out?\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s all, \"Rat boy was dancing and nicked the casting with his dagger.\"\\n\\n And Jared\u0027s all, \"I wasn\u0027t dancing. I had some espresso and I was telling them my novel and I lost my balance on your stupid boots.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"You can\u0027t give him caffeine, Countess. His aunt gave him a hundred-dollar Starbucks card for Christmas and we had to have an intervention.\"\\n\\n And Jody pauses and looks back at me, her eyes looking all emerald-like, because except for her hair, she has no color in her face and she\u0027s like, \"Tommy didn\u0027t know how to turn to mist, Abby. I never had a chance to teach him before you bronzed us. He\u0027s been trapped in here, fully conscious, for five weeks.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m like backing away, because I\u0027ve seen the Countess pissed off before, like when the Animals kidnapped Tommy and she had to kick their asses to get him back, but now she\u0027s all jaw tightened like she\u0027s keeping herself from tearing my arms off or something. So I sort of feel for the button on the cuff of my sun jacket. Not like I was going to fry the Countess, because I wouldn\u0027t do that, but just for security.\\n\\n And she just snaps her hand out and before I can move she\u0027s pulled the battery out of my inside pocket and ripped off the wire leads. I mean like faster than you can blink.\\n\\n So I\u0027m like, \"I wasn\u0027t going to light it up.\"\\n\\n And she\u0027s all, \"Just to be safe.\"\\n\\n But I\u0027m not feeling safe. And I can tell that Jared isn\u0027t feeling safe because he\u0027s sort of sniffling like he\u0027s going to start crying.\\n\\n And Jody is sawing on the bronze like a crazy person-on the side where she used to be, so she doesn\u0027t cut Tommy-and finally she has, like, enough sawed away that she can pull a piece away and look in.\\n\\n And she\u0027s all, \"Tommy, we\u0027re going to get you out of there. I have to be careful, but I\u0027ll get you out of there soon.\"\\n\\n And Jared is like, \"Do you need a flashlight?\"\\n\\n And Jody is like, \"No, I can see.\"\\n\\n And Jared is all, \"Is he dead?\"\\n\\n And right then Jody snaps a hacksaw blade and goes, \"Well of course he\u0027s dead, he\u0027s a vampyre.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Duh? Tard.\" As I hand Jody another blade.\\n\\n I have to say, that for someone with super powers and immortality, the Countess kind of sucks ass with tools. I guess the dark gift doesn\u0027t include home improvement skills.\\n\\n \u0027Kayso, after about an hour the Countess pulls a big piece off the statue, revealing Tommy\u0027s face and torso and whatnot, and he\u0027s just stuck there, not moving, not opening his eyes, and even whiter than the Countess, kind of a light bruise-blue color.\\n\\n And Jared is all, \"He dead?\"\\n\\n And Jody is like kind of between a scream and a sob, and she\u0027s like, \"Get me another blood bag, Jared. And Abby, where the fuck are my clothes?\" And a little blood tear runs down her cheek.\\n\\n And I\u0027m like, \"Uh-oh.\" Because now I realize why she\u0027s wearing my clothes. When Foo and I moved in we put all of Tommy and Jody\u0027s clothes in vacuum bags under the bed. So I\u0027m like, \"What do you want to wear, Countess? I\u0027ll get it. I mean, you can wear my stuff any time you want, because I am your faithful minion, but you have been endowed by your creator with significantly more boobage and junk in the trunk than me, no offense, and my stuff doesn\u0027t exactly fit you. No offense.\"\\n\\n And Jared is all, \"She had your Emily hoody on over that but it got blood all over it.\" Not helping at all. \"Hey, who wants a latte?\"\\n\\n And the Countess snarled at Jared, full frontal fangs and all. And Jared jumped back and turned his ankle. And I\u0027m like, \"Oh shit!\"\\n\\n And she barks, \"Blood!\"\\n\\n And Jared and I are all, \"Coming right up. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.\"\\n\\n And I bring her the bag of blood and she tears it open with her teeth and just pours it over his lips and in his mouth and nothing happens. And Jody is crying and getting louder and Jared and I are getting more and more freaked out and even all the rats in their little boxes are freaking out and running around in circles and whatnot. And finally Tommy\u0027s eyes pop open, and they\u0027re like crystal blue, like ice, not like eyes, and he screams, and I swear to fucking zombie Jebus, the whole wall of windows in the loft just shattered in the frames.\\n\\n So Jared and I are all bent over in the corner, covering our ears, and Tommy comes flying out of the statue. You can hear his leg bones cracking like pretzels as he pulls them out, but he scurries on his hands, knocking rats and furniture every which way, coming right at me, fangs first.\\n\\n And I go to reach for the button on my sleeve, but he\u0027s on me, biting my neck. He\u0027s so strong it\u0027s like trying to fight a statue, and I can hear Jody screaming, and the skin on my neck tearing in shreds. And my vision is like tunneling down to dark, and I\u0027m thinking, I\u0027m fucking dying? What the fuck\u0027s up with that?\\n\\n Then there\u0027s this loud clang, like a bell, and I feel Tommy pulled off me. And light sort of comes back on. I can see the Countess standing there, holding Foo\u0027s stainless-steel floor lamp like it\u0027s a lance, and she\u0027s obviously just smacked Tommy with it hard enough to knock him off of me. But instead of going at her, he comes scurrying right back at me, smearing blood all over the floor and everything.\\n\\n And the Countess catches him by the neck from behind and swings him around and out through the broken windows, and the metal frames and everything go with him.\\n\\n So there\u0027s the scream again, and I\u0027m holding my neck, and I sort of crawl to the big hole that used to be the front wall of the loft, and Tommy is in the middle of the street below, naked, in a big splash of metal and glass, and he\u0027s like crawling up the side of a car to his feet.\\n\\n And Jody\u0027s beside me. And she\u0027s all, \"Tommy! Tommy!\"\\n\\n But he\u0027s limping off down the alley across the street, walking like his legs are still broken, but maybe healing or something as he goes, but hurting like holy-fuck.\\n\\n So Jody takes my head and turns it to the side and pulls my hand away from the bite. And I feel like I\u0027m going to pass out. But she bends down and licks my neck, like three times, then puts my hand back on the wound.\\n\\n \"Hold that. It\u0027ll heal in a second.\" Then she shook me and was all, \"Now, where the fuck are my clothes?\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"Under the bed. Vacuum bags.\"\\n\\n I think I passed out then, because next thing I remember, the Countess is standing there in jeans and boots and her red leather jacket, and she\u0027s stuffing bags of blood into my biohazard messenger bag.\\n\\n And she\u0027s all, \"I\u0027m taking this.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"\u0027Kay.\" Then I\u0027m like, \"You saved me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m taking half the money, too,\" she said.\\n\\n I\u0027m all, \"You can\u0027t go. Where will you go? Who will take care of you?\"\\n\\n \"Like you did?\" she says.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I said.\\n\\n And she\u0027s all, \"I know. I have to find him. I brought him into this. He never wanted any of this. He just wanted someone to love him.\"\\n\\n So she starts to leave, without even saying good-bye, and I\u0027m all, \"Countess, wait, there\u0027s vampyre cats.\"\\n\\n And she stops. And she turns all, \"Whaaaa?\"\\n\\n And Jared is all nodding and going, \"Really. Really.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m, \"Chet turned a bunch of kitties into vampyre kitties. They attacked the Emperor last night and they ate a meter maid.\"\\n\\n And she was all, \"Oh, for fuck\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n And I\u0027m all, \"I know, I know.\"\\n\\n Then she was gone. And Jared was like in the middle of catching some escaped rats and he\u0027s all, \"You guys are going to totally lose your security deposit.\"\\n\\n Jody is just gone. Gone. On her own in the night. It\u0027s like Lord Byron said in that poem \"Darkness.\"\\n\\n Darkness had no need\\n\\n Of aid from them-\\n\\n She was the Universe.\\n\\n I\u0027d like to go bone my sister now.\\n\\n I\u0027m paraphrasing. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bite-me-a-love-story-a-love-story-3/page-7.html","bookId":2044,"book":{"id":2044,"title":"Bite Me: A Love Story (A Love Story #3)","description":"Storyline: The city of San Francisco is being stalked by a huge shaved vampyre cat named Chet, and only I, Abby Normal, emergency backup mistress of the Greater Bay Area night, and my manga-haired love monkey, Foo Dog, stand between the ravenous monster and a bloody massacre of the general public.
