{"id":33287,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI TABLE Z","content":"At twelve forty-five Bond and Leiter paid off their cab and walked in under the sign which announced \u0027The Boneyard\u0027 in violet and green neon. \\n\\n The thudding rhythm and the sour-sweet smell rocked them as they pushed through the heavy curtains inside the swing door. The eyes of the hat-check girls glowed and beckoned. \\n\\n \u0027Have you reserved, Sir?\u0027 asked the head waiter. \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027We don\u0027t mind sitting at the bar.\u0027 \\n\\n The head waiter consulted his table-plan. He seemed to decide. He put his pencil firmly through a space at the end of the card. \\n\\n \u0027Party hasn\u0027t shown. Guess Ah cain\u0027t hold their res\u0027vation all night. This way, please.\u0027 He held his card high over his head and led them round the small crowded dance-floor. He pulled out one of the two chairs and removed the \u0027Reserved\u0027 sign. \\n\\n \u0027Sam,\u0027 he called a waiter over. \u0027Look after these gem-mums order.\u0027 He moved away. \\n\\n They ordered Scotch-and-soda and chicken sandwiches. \\n\\n Bond sniffed. \u0027Marihuana,\" he commented. \\n\\n \u0027Most of the real hep-cats smoke reefers,\u0027 explained Leiter. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t be allowed most places.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond looked round. The music had stopped. The small four-piece band, clarinet, double-bass, electric guitar and drums, was moving out of the corner opposite. The dozen or so couples were walking and jiving to their tables and the crimson light was turned off under the glass dance-floor. Instead, pencil-thin lights in the roof came on and hit coloured glass witchballs, larger than footballs, that hung at intervals round the wall. They were of different hues, golden, blue, green, violet, red. As the beams of light hit them, they glowed like coloured suns. The walls, varnished black, mirrored their reflections as did the sweat on the ebony faces of the men. Sometimes a man sitting between two lights showed cheeks of different colour, green on one side, perhaps, and red on the other. The lighting made it impossible to distinguish features unless they were only a few feet away. Some of the lights turned the girls\u0027 lipstick black, others lit their whole faces in a warm glow on one side and gave the other profile the luminosity of a drowned corpse. \\n\\n The whole scene was macabre and livid, as if El Greco had done a painting by moonlight of an exhumed graveyard in a burning town. \\n\\n It was not a large room, perhaps sixty foot square. There were about fifty tables and the customers were packed in like black olives in a jar. It was hot and the air was thick with smoke and the sweet, feral smell of two hundred negro bodies. The noise was terrific - an undertone of the jabber of negroes enjoying themselves without restraint, punctuated by sharp bursts of noise, shouts and high giggles, as loud voices called to each other across the room. \\n\\n \u0027Sweet Jeessus, look who\u0027s hyar…\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Where you been keepin yoself, baby…\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Gawd\u0027s troof. It\u0027s Pinkus… Hi Pinkus…\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Cmon over…\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Lemme be… Lemme be, Fse telling ya…\u0027 (The noise of a slap.) \\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s G-G. Cmon G-G. Strut yo stuff…\u0027 \\n\\n From time to time a man or girl would erupt on to the dance-floor and start a wild solo jive. Friends would clap the rhythm. There would be a burst of catcalls and whistles. If it was a girl, there would be cries of \u0027Strip, strip, strip,\u0027 \u0027Get hot, baby!\u0027 \u0027Shake it, shake it,\u0027 and the MC would come out and clear the floor amidst groans and shouts of derision. \\n\\n The sweat began to bead on Bond\u0027s forehead. Leiter leant over and cupped his hands. \u0027Three exits. Front. Service behind us. Behind the band.\u0027 Bond nodded. At that moment he felt it didn\u0027t matter. This was nothing new to Leiter, but for Bond it was a close-up of the raw material on which The Big Man worked, the clay in his hands. The evening was gradually putting flesh on the dossiers he had read in London and New York. If the evening ended now, without any closer sight of Mr. Big himself, Bond still felt his education in the case would be almost complete. He took a deep draught of his whisky. There was a burst of applause. The MC had come out on to the dance-floor, a tall negro in immaculate tails with a red carnation in his button hole. He stood, holding up his hands. A single white spotlight caught him. The rest of the room went dark. \\n\\n There was silence. \\n\\n \u0027Folks,\u0027 announced the MG with a broad flash of gold and white teeth. \u0027This is it.\u0027 \\n\\n There was excited clapping. \\n\\n He turned to the left of the floor, directly across from Leiter and Bond. \\n\\n He flung out his right hand. Another spot came on. \\n\\n \u0027Mistah Jungles Japhet \u0027n his drums.\u0027 \\n\\n A crash of applause, catcalls, whistles. \\n\\n Four grinning negroes in flame-coloured shirts and peg-top white trousers were revealed, squatting astride four tapering barrels with rawhide membranes. The drums were of different sizes. The negroes were all gaunt and stringy. The one sitting astride the bass drum rose briefly and shook clasped hands at the spectators. \\n\\n \u0027Voodoo drummers from Haiti,\u0027 whispered Leiter. \\n\\n There was silence. With the tips of their fingers the drummers began a slow, broken beat, a soft rumba shuffle. \\n\\n \u0027And now, friends,\u0027 announced the MC, still turned towards the drums, \u0027G-G…\u0027 he paused, \u0027SUMATRA.\u0027 \\n\\n The last word was a yell. He began to clap. There was pandemonium in the room, a frenzy of applause. The door behind the drums burst open and two huge negroes, naked except for gold loincloths, ran out on to the floor carrying between them, her arms round their necks, a tiny figure, swathed completely in black ostrich feathers, a black domino across her eyes. \\n\\n They put her down in the middle of the floor. They bowed down on either side of her until their foreheads met the ground. She took two paces forward. With the spotlight off them, the two negroes melted away into the shadows and through the door. \\n\\n The MC had disappeared. There was absolute silence save for the soft thud of the drums. \\n\\n The girl put her hand up to her throat and the cloak of black feathers came away from the front of her body and spread out into a five-foot black fan. She swirled it slowly behind her until it stood up like a peacock\u0027s tail. She was naked except for a brief vee of black lace and a black sequin star in the centre of each breast and the thin black domino across her eyes. Her body was small, hard, bronze, beautiful. It was slightly oiled and glinted in the white light. \\n\\n The audience was silent. The drums began to step up the tempo. The bass drum kept its beat dead on the timing of the human pulse. \\n\\n The girl\u0027s naked stomach started slowly to revolve in time with the rhythm. She swept the black feathers across and behind her again, and her hips started to grind in time with the bass drum. The upper part of her body was motionless. The black feathers swirled again, and now her feet were shifting and her shoulders. The drums beat louder. Each part of her body seemed to be keeping a different time. Her lips were bared slightly from her teeth. Her nostrils began to flare. Her eyes glinted hotly through the diamond slits. It was a sexy, pug-like face - chienne was the only word Bond could think of. \\n\\n The drums thudded faster, a complexity of interlaced rhythms. The girl tossed the big fan off the floor, held her arms up above her head. Her whole body began to shiver. Her belly moved faster. Round and round, in and out. Her legs straddled. Her hips began to revolve in a wide circle. Suddenly she plucked the sequin star off her right breast and threw it into the audience. The first noise came from the spectators, a quiet growl. Then they were silent again. She plucked off the other star. Again the growl and then silence. The drums began to crash and roll. Sweat poured off the drummers. Their hands fluttered like grey flannel on the pale membranes. Their eyes were bulging, distant. Their heads were slightly bent to one side as if they were listening. They hardly glanced at the girl. The audience panted softly, liquid eyes bulging and rolling. \\n\\n The sweat was shining all over her now. Her breasts and stomach glistened with it. She broke into great shuddering jerks. Her mouth opened and she screamed softly. Her hands snaked down to her sides and suddenly she had torn away the strip of lace. She threw it into the audience. There was nothing now but a single black G-string. The drums went into a hurricane of sexual rhythm. She screamed softly again and then, her arms stretched before her as a balance, she started to lower her body down to the floor and up again. Faster and faster. Bond could hear the audience panting and grunting like pigs at the trough. He felt his own hands gripping the tablecloth. His mouth was dry. \\n\\n The audience began to shout at her. \u0027Cmon, G-G. Take it away, Baby. Cmon. Grind Baby, grind.\u0027 \\n\\n She sank to her knees and as the rhythm slowly died so she too went into a last series of juddering spasms, mewing softly. \\n\\n The drums came down to a slow tom-tom beat and shuffle. The audience howled for her body. Harsh obscenities came from different corners of the room. \\n\\n The MC came on to the floor. A spot went on him. \\n\\n \u0027Okay, folks, okay.\u0027 The sweat was pouring off his chin. He spread his arms in surrender. \\n\\n \u0027Da G-G AGREES!\u0027 \\n\\n There was a delighted howl from the audience. Now she would be quite naked. \u0027Take it off, G-G. Show yoself Baby. Cmon, cmon.\u0027 \\n\\n The drums growled and stuttered softly. \\n\\n \u0027But, mah friends,\u0027 yelled the MC,\u0027 she stipperlates -With da lights OUT!\u0027 \\n\\n There was a frustrated groan from the audience. The whole room was plunged in darkness. \\n\\n Must be an old gag, thought Bond to himself. \\n\\n Suddenly all his senses were alert. \\n\\n The howling of the mob was disappearing, rapidly. At the same time he felt cold air on his face. He ielt as if he was sinking. \\n\\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 shouted Leiter. His voice was close but it sounded hollow. \\n\\n Christ! thought Bond. \\n\\n Something snapped shut above his head. He put his hand out behind him. It touched a moving wall a foot from his back. \\n\\n \u0027Lights,\u0027 said a voice, quietly. \\n\\n At the same time both his arms were gripped. He was pressed down in his chair. \\n\\n Opposite him, still at the table, sat Leiter, a huge negro grasping his elbows. They were in a tiny square cell. To right and left were two more negroes in plain clothes with guns trained on them. \\n\\n There was the sharp hiss of a hydraulic garage lift and the table settled quietly to the floor. Bond glanced up. There was the faint join of a broad trap-door a few feet above their heads. No sound came through it. \\n\\n One of the negroes grinned. \\n\\n \u0027Take it easy, folks. Enjoy da ride?\u0027 \\n\\n Leiter let out one single harsh obscenity. Bond relaxed his muscles, waiting. \\n\\n \u0027Which is da Limey?\u0027 asked the negro who had spoken. He seemed to be in charge. The pistol he held trained lazily on Bond\u0027s heart was very fancy. There was a glint of mother-of-pearl between his black fingers on the stock and the long octagonal barrel was finely chased. \\n\\n \u0027Dis one, Ah guess,\u0027 said the negro who was holding Bond\u0027s arm. \u0027He got da scar.\u0027 \\n\\n The negro\u0027s grip on Bond\u0027s arm was terrific. It was as if he had two fierce tourniquets applied above the elbows. His hands were beginning to go numb. \\n\\n The man with the fancy gun came round the corner of the table. He shoved the muzzle of his gun into Bond\u0027s stomach. The hammer was back. \\n\\n \u0027You oughtn\u0027t to miss at that range,\u0027 said Bond. \\n\\n \u0027Shaddap,\u0027 said the negro. He frisked Bond expertly with his left hand - legs, thighs, back, sides. He dug out Bond\u0027s gun and handed it to the other armed man. \\n\\n \u0027Give dat to da Boss, Tee-Hee,\u0027 he said. \u0027Take da Limey up. Yuh go \u0027long wid em. Da other guy stays wid me.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yassuh,\u0027 said the man called Tee-Hee, a paunchy negro in a chocolate shirt and lavender-coloured peg-top trousers. \\n\\n Bond was hauled to his feet. He had one foot hooked under a leg of the table. He yanked hard. There was a crash of glass and silverware. At the same moment, Leiter kicked out backwards round the leg of his chair. There was a satisfactory \u0027klonk\u0027 as his heel caught his guard\u0027s shin. Bond did the same but missed. There was a moment of chaos, but neither of the guards slackened his grip. Leiter\u0027s guard picked him bodily out of the chair as if he had been a child, faced him to the wall and slammed him into it. It nearly smashed Leiter\u0027s nose. The guard swung him round. Blood was streaming down over his mouth. \\n\\n The two guns were still trained unwaveringly on them. It had been a futile effort, but for a split second they had regained the initiative and effaced the sudden shock of capture. \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027 waste yo breff,\u0027 said the negro who had been giving the orders. \u0027Take da Limey away.\u0027 He addressed Bond\u0027s guard. \u0027Mr. Big\u0027s waiten\u0027.\u0027 He turned to Leiter. \\n\\n \u0027Yo kin tell yo fren\u0027 goodbye,\u0027 he said. \u0027Yo is unlikely be seein\u0027 yoselves agin.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond smiled at Leiter. \u0027Lucky we made a date for the police to meet us here at two,\u0027 he said. \u0027See you at the lineup.\u0027 \\n\\n Leiter grinned back. His teeth were red with blood. \u0027Commissioner Monahan\u0027s going to be pleased with this bunch. Be seeing you.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Crap,\u0027 said the negro with conviction. \u0027Get goin\u0027.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond\u0027s guard whipped him round and shoved him against a section of the wall. It opened on a pivot into a long bare passage. The man called Tee-Hee pushed past them and led the way. \\n\\n The door swung to behind them. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565/46405.html","bookId":1275,"book":{"id":1275,"title":"007之生死关头 Live And Let Die","description":"简介： 讲述了007詹姆斯邦德奉命调查三名英国情报人员在美国遇害事件，而邦德必须对抗走私海洛因的Mr. Big和他的巫毒教信徒的故事。007接到一单新任务，英国三名情报人员在美国遇害，英政府却无法查出凶手，007赶赴异邦调查真相，意外发现这宗案件不仅与邪恶的巫术有关，还牵涉...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/25/14-08-39-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
