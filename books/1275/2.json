{"id":33283,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II INTERVIEW WITH M","content":"THE grey Bentley convertible, the 1933 4 1/2-litre with the Amherst-Villiers supercharger, had been brought round a few minutes earlier from the garage where he kept it and the engine had kicked directly he pressed the self-starter. He had turned on the twin fog lights and had driven gingerly along King\u0027s Road and then up Sloane Street into Hyde Park. \n M\u0027s Chief of Staff had telephoned at midnight to say that M wanted to see Bond at nine the next morning. \u0027Bit early in the day,\u0027 he had apologized, \u0027but he seems to want some action from somebody. Been brooding for weeks. Suppose he\u0027s made up his mind at last.\u0027 \n \u0027Any line you can give me over the telephone?\u0027 \n \u0027A for Apple and C for Charlie,\u0027 said the Chief of Staff, and rang off. \n That meant that the case concerned Stations A and C, the sections of the Secret Service dealing respectively with the United States and the Caribbean. Bond had worked for a time under Station A during the war, but he knew little of C or its problems. \n As he crawled beside the kerb up through Hyde Park, the slow drumbeat of his two-inch exhaust keeping him company, he felt excited at the prospect of his interview with M, the remarkable man who was then, and still is, head of the Secret Service. He had not looked into those cold, shrewd eyes since the end of the summer. On that occasion M had been pleased. \n \u0027Take some leave,\u0027 he had said. \u0027Plenty of leave. Then get some new skin grafted over the back of that hand. \"Q\" will put you on to the best man and fix a date. Can\u0027t have you going round with that damn Russian trade-mark on you. See if I can find you a good target when you\u0027ve got cleaned up. Good kick.\u0027 \n The hand had been fixed, painlessly but slowly. The thin scars, the single Russian letter which stands for SCH, the first letter of Spion, a spy, had been removed and as Bond thought of the man with the stiletto who had cut them he clenched his hands on the wheel. \n What was happening to the brilliant organization of which the man with the knife had been an agent, the Soviet organ of vengeance, SMERSH, short for Smyert Spionam -Death to Spies? Was it still as powerful, still as efficient? Who controlled it now that Beria was gone? After the great gambling case in which he had been involved at Royale-les-Eaux, Bond had sworn to get back at them. He had told M as much at that last interview. Was this appointment with M to start him on his trail of revenge? \n Bond\u0027s eyes narrowed as he gazed into the murk of Regents Park and his face in the faint dashlight was cruel and hard. \n He drew up in the mews behind the gaunt high building, handed his car over to one of the plain-clothes drivers from the pool and walked round to the main entrance. He was taken up in the lift to the top floor and along the thickly carpeted corridor he knew so well to the door next to M\u0027s. The Chief of Staff was waiting for him and at once spoke to M on the intercom. \n \u0027007\u0027s here now, Sir.\u0027 \n \u0027Send him in.\u0027 \n The desirable Miss Moneypenny, M\u0027s all-powerful private secretary, gave him an encouraging smile and he walked through the double doors. At once the green light came on, high on the wall in the room he had left. M was not to be disturbed as long as it burned. \n A reading lamp with a green glass shade made a pool of light across the red leather top of the broad desk. The rest of the room was darkened by the fog outside the windows. \n \u0027Morning, 007. Let\u0027s have a look at the hand. Not a bad job. Where did they take the skin from?\u0027 \n \u0027High up on the forearm, Sir.\u0027 \n \u0027Hm. Hairs\u0027ll grow a bit thick. Crooked too. However. Can\u0027t be helped. Looks all right for the time being. Sit down.\u0027 \n Bond walked round to the single chair which faced M across the desk. The grey eyes looked at him, through him. \n \u0027Had a good rest?\u0027 \n \u0027Yes thank you, Sir.\u0027 \n \u0027Ever seen one of these?\u0027 M abruptly fished something out of his waistcoat pocket. He tossed it half way across the desk towards Bond. It fell with a faint clang on the red leather and lay, gleaming richly, an inch-wide, hammered gold coin. \n Bond picked it up, turned it over, weighed it in his hand. \n \u0027No, Sir. Worth about five pounds, perhaps.\u0027 \n \u0027Fifteen to a collector. It\u0027s a Rose Noble of Edward IV.\u0027 \n M fished again in his waistcoat pocket and tossed more magnificent gold coins on to the table in front of Bond. As he did so, he glanced at each one and identified it. \n \u0027Double Excellente, Spanish, Ferdinand and Isabella, 1510 ; Ecu au Soleil, French, Charles IX, 1574; Double Ecu d\u0027or, French, Henry IV, 1600; Double Ducat, Spanish, Philip II, 1560; Ryder, Dutch, Charles d\u0027Egmond, 1538; Quadruple, Genoa, 1617; Double louis, a la mcche courte, French, Louis XIV, 1644. Worth a lot of money melted down. Much more to collectors, ten to twenty pounds each. Notice anything common to them all?\u0027 \n Bond reflected. \u0027No, Sir.\u0027 \n \u0027All minted before 1650. Bloody Morgan, the pirate, was Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Jamaica from 1675 to 1688. The English coin is the joker in the pack. Probably shipped out to pay the Jamaica garrison. But for that and the dates, these could have come from any other treasure-trove put together by the great pirates - L\u0027Ollonais, Pierre le Grand, Sharp, Sawkins, Blackbeard. As it is, and both Spinks and the British Museum agree, this is almost certainly part of Bloody Morgan\u0027s treasure.\u0027 \n M paused to fill his pipe and light it. He didn\u0027t invite Bond to smoke and Bond would not have thought of doing so uninvited. \n \u0027And the hell of a treasure it must be. So far nearly a thousand of these and similar coins have turned up in the United States in the last few months. And if the Special Branch of the Treasury, and the FBI, have traced a thousand, how many more have been melted down or disappeared into private collections? And they keep on coming in, turning up in banks, bullion merchants, curio shops, but mostly pawnbrokers of course. The FBI are in a proper fix. If they put these on the police notices of stolen property they know the source will dry up. They\u0027d be melted down into gold bars and channelled straight into the black bullion market. Have to sacrifice the rarity value of the coins, but the gold would go straight underground. As it is, someone\u0027s using the negroes - porters, sleeping-car attendants, truck-drivers - and getting the money well spread over the States. Quite innocent people. Here\u0027s a typical case.\u0027 M opened a brown folder bearing the Top Secret red star and selected a single sheet of paper. Through the reverse side, as M held it up, Bond could see the engraved heading : \u0027Department of Justice. Federal Bureau of Investigations.\u0027 M read from it: \n \u0027Zachary Smith, 35, Negro, Member of the Sleeping Car Porters Brotherhood, address gob West 126th Street, New York City.\u0027 (M looked up : \u0027Harlem,\u0027 he said.) \u0027Subject was identified by Arthur Fein of Fein Jewels Inc., 870 Lenox Avenue, as having offered for sale on November 21st last four gold coins of the sixteenth and seventeenth century (details attached). Fein offered a hundred dollars which was accepted. Interrogated later, Smith said they had been sold to him in Seventh Heaven Bar-B-Q (a well-known Harlem bar) for twenty dollars each by a negro he had never seen before or since. Vendor had said they were worth fifty dollars each at Tiffany\u0027s, but that he, the vendor, wanted ready cash and Tiffany\u0027s was too far anyway. Smith bought one for twenty dollars and on finding that a neighbouring pawnbroker would offer him twenty-five dollars for it, returned to the bar and purchased the remaining three for sixty dollars. The next morning he took them to Fein\u0027s. Subject has no criminal record.\u0027 \n M returned the paper to the brown folder. \n \u0027That\u0027s typical,\u0027 he said. \u0027Several times they\u0027ve caught up with the next link, the middle man who bought them a bit cheaper and they find that he bought a handful, in one case a hundred of them, from some man who presumably got them cheaper still. All these larger transactions have taken place in Harlem or Florida. Always the next man in the link was an unknown negro, in all cases a white-collar man, prosperous, educated, who said he guessed they were treasure-trove, Blackbeard\u0027s treasure. \n \u0027This Blackbeard story would stand up to most investigations,\u0027 continued M, \u0027because there is reason to believe that part of his hoard was dug up around Christmas Day, 1928, at a place called Plum Point. It\u0027s a narrow neck of land in Beaufort County, North Carolina, where a stream called Bath Creek flows into the Pamlico River. Don\u0027t think I\u0027m an expert,\u0027 he smiled, \u0027you can read all about this in the dossier. So, in theory, it would be quite reasonable for those lucky treasure-hunters to have hidden the loot until everyone had forgotten the story and then thrown it fast on the market. Or else they could have sold it en bloc at the time, or later, and the purchaser has just decided to cash in. Anyway it\u0027s a good enough cover except on two counts.\u0027 \n M paused and relit his pipe. \n \u0027Firstly, Blackbeard operated from about 1690 to 1710 and it\u0027s improbable that none of his coin should have been minted later than 1650. Also, as I said before, it\u0027s very unlikely that his treasure would contain Edward IV Rose Nobles, since there\u0027s no record of an English treasure-ship being captured on its way to Jamaica. The Brethren of the Coast wouldn\u0027t take them on. Too heavily escorted. There were much easier pickings if you were sailing in those days \"on the plundering account\" as they called it. \n \u0027Secondly,\u0027 and M looked at the ceiling and then back at Bond, \u0027I know where the treasure is. At least I\u0027m pretty sure I do. And it\u0027s not in America. It\u0027s in Jamaica, and it is Bloody Morgan\u0027s, and I guess it\u0027s one of the most valuable treasure-troves in history.\u0027 \n \u0027Good Lord,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027How… where do we come into it?\" \n M held up his hand. \u0027You\u0027ll find all the details in here,\u0027 he let his hand come down on the brown folder. \u0027Briefly, Station C has been interested in a Diesel yacht, the Secatur, which has been running from a small island on the North Coast of Jamaica through the Florida Keys into the Gulf of Mexico, to a place called St. Petersburg. Sort of pleasure resort, near Tampa. West Coast of Florida. With the help of the FBI we\u0027ve traced the ownership of this boat and of the island to a man called Mr. Big, a negro gangster. Lives in Harlem. Ever heard of him?\u0027 \n \u0027No,\u0027 said Bond. \n \u0027And curiously enough,\u0027 M\u0027s voice was softer and quieter, \u0027a twenty-dollar bill which one of these casual negroes had paid for a gold coin and whose number he had noted for \u0027t\u0027t- Peaka Peow, the Numbers game, was paid out by one of Mr. Big\u0027s lieutenants. And it was paid,\u0027 M pointed the stem of his pipe at Bond, \u0027for information received, to an FBI double-agent who is a member of the Communist Party.\u0027 \n Bond whistled softly. \n \u0027In short,\u0027 continued M, \u0027we suspect that this Jamaican treasure is being used to finance the Soviet espionage system, or an important part of it, in America. And our suspicion becomes a certainty when I tell you who this Mr. Big is.\u0027 \n Bond waited, his eyes fixed on M\u0027s. \n \u0027Mr. Big,\u0027 said M, weighing his words, \u0027is probably the most powerful negro criminal in the world. He is,\u0027 and he enumerated carefully,\u0027 the head of the Black Widow Voodoo cult and believed by that cult to be the Baron Samedi himself. (You\u0027ll find all about that here,\u0027 he tapped the folder, \u0027and it\u0027ll frighten the daylights out of you.) He is also a Soviet agent. And finally he is, and this will particularly interest you, Bond, a known member of SMERSH.\u0027 \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Bond slowly, \u0027I see now.\u0027 \n \u0027Quite a case,\u0027 said M, looking keenly at him. \u0027And quite a man, this Mr. Big.\u0027 \n \u0027I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever heard of a great negro criminal before,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027Chinamen, of course, the men behind the opium trade. There\u0027ve been some big-time Japs, mostly in pearls and drugs. Plenty of negroes mixed up in diamonds and gold in Africa, but always in a small way. They don\u0027t seem to take to big business. Pretty law-abiding chaps I should have thought except when they\u0027ve drunk too much.\u0027 \n \u0027Our man\u0027s a bit of an exception,\u0027 said M. \u0027He\u0027s not pure negro. Born in Haiti. Good dose of French blood. Trained in Moscow, too, as you\u0027ll see from the file. And the negro races are just beginning to throw up geniuses in all the professions - scientists, doctors, writers. It\u0027s about time they turned out a great criminal. After all, there are 250,000,000 of them in the world. Nearly a third of the white population. They\u0027ve got plenty of brains and ability and guts. And now Moscow\u0027s taught one of them the technique.\u0027 \n \u0027I\u0027d like to meet him,\u0027 said Bond. Then he added, mildly, \u0027I\u0027d like to meet any member of SMERSH.\u0027 \n \u0027All right then, Bond. Take it away.\u0027 M handed him the thick brown folder. \u0027Talk it over with Plender and Damon. Be ready to start in a week. It\u0027s a joint CIA and FBI job. For God\u0027s sake don\u0027t step on the FBI\u0027s toes. Covered with corns. Good luck.\u0027 \n Bond had gone straight down to Commander Damon, Head of Station A, an alert Canadian who controlled the link with the Central Intelligence Agency, America\u0027s Secret Service. \n Damon looked up from his desk. \u0027I see you\u0027ve bought it,\u0027 he said, looking at the folder. \u0027Thought you would. Sit down,\u0027 he waved to an armchair beside the electric fire. \u0027When you\u0027ve waded through it all, I\u0027ll fill in the gaps.\u0027 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565/46401.html","bookId":1275,"book":{"id":1275,"title":"007之生死关头 Live And Let Die","description":"简介： 讲述了007詹姆斯邦德奉命调查三名英国情报人员在美国遇害事件，而邦德必须对抗走私海洛因的Mr. Big和他的巫毒教信徒的故事。007接到一单新任务，英国三名情报人员在美国遇害，英政府却无法查出凶手，007赶赴异邦调查真相，意外发现这宗案件不仅与邪恶的巫术有关，还牵涉...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/25/14-08-39-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
