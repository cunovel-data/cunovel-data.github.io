{"id":33290,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX TRUE OR FALSE?","content":"BOND looked at the telephone, then he got up and walked over to the sideboard. He put a handful of wilted icecubes into a tall glass, poured in three inches of Haig and Haig and swilled the mixture round in the glass to cool and dilute it. Then he drank down half the glass in one long swallow. He put the glass down and eased himself out of his coat. His left hand was so swollen that he could only just get it through the sleeve. His little finger was still crooked back and the pain was vicious as it scraped against the cloth. The ringer was nearly black. He pulled down his tie and undid the top of his shirt. Then he picked up his glass, took another deep swallow, and walked back to the telephone. Leiter answered at once. \u0027Thank God,\u0027 said Leiter with real feeling. \u0027What\u0027s the damage?\" \u0027Broken finger,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027How about you?\u0027 \u0027Blackjack. Knocked out. Nothing serious. They started off by considering all sorts of ingenious things. Wanted to couple me to the compressed-air pump in the garage. Start on the ears and then proceed elsewhere. When no instructions came from The Big Man they got bored and I got to arguing the finer points of Jazz with Blabbermouth, the man with the fancy six-shooter. We got on to Duke Ellington and agreed that we liked our band-leaders to be percussion men, not wind. We agreed the piano or the drums held the band together better than any other solo instrument - Jelly-roll Morton, for instance. Apropos the Duke, I told him the crack about the clarinet - \"an ill woodwind that nobody blows good\". That made him laugh fit to bust. Suddenly we were friends. The other man - The Flannel, he was called - got sour and Blabbermouth told him he could go off duty, he\u0027d look after me. Then The Big Man rang down.\u0027 \u0027I was there,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027It didn\u0027t sound so hot.\u0027 \u0027Blabbermouth was worried as hell. He wandered round the room talking to himself. Suddenly he used the blackjack, hard, and I went out. Next thing I knew we were outside Bellevue Hospital. About half after three. Blabbermouth was very apologetic, said it was the least he could have done. I believe him. He begged me not to give him away. Said he was going to report that he\u0027d left me half dead. Of course I promised to leak back some very lurid details. We parted on the best of terms. I got some treatment at the Emergency ward and came home. I was worried to Hell an\u0027 gone about you, but after a while the telephone started ringing. Police and FBI. Seems The Big Man has complained that some fool Limey went berserk at The Boneyard early this morning, shot three of his men - two chauffeurs and a waiter, if you please - stole one of his cars and got away, leaving his overcoat and hat in the cloakroom. The Big Man\u0027s yelling for action. Of course I warned off the dicks and the FBI, but they\u0027re madder\u0027n hell and we\u0027ve got to get out of town at once. It\u0027ll miss the mornings but it\u0027ll be splashed all over the afternoon blatts and Radio and TV\u0027ll have it. Apart from all that, Mr. Big will be after you like a nest of hornets. Anyway, I\u0027ve got some plans fixed. Now you tell, and God, am I glad to hear your voice!\u0027 Bond gave a detailed account of all that had happened. He forgot nothing. When he had finished, Leiter gave a low whistle. \u0027Boy,\u0027 he said with admiration. \u0027You certainly made a dent in The Big Man\u0027s machine. But were you lucky. That Solitaire dame certainly seems to have saved your bacon. D\u0027you think we can use her?\u0027 \u0027Could if we could get near her,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I should think he keeps her pretty close.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll have to think about that another day,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Now we\u0027d better get moving. I\u0027ll hang up and call you back in a few minutes. First I\u0027ll get the police surgeon round to you right away. Be along in a quarter of an hour or so. Then I\u0027ll talk to the Commissioner myself and sort out some of the police angles. They can stall a bit by discovering the car. The F B I\u0027ll have to tip off the radio and newspaper boys so that at least we can keep your name out of it and all this Limey talk. Otherwise we shall have the British Ambassador being hauled out of bed and parades by the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and God knows what all. Leiter chuckled down the telephone. \u0027Better have a word with your chief in London. It\u0027s about half after ten their time. You\u0027ll need a bit of protection. I can look after the CIA, but the FBI have got a bad attack of \"see-here-young-man\" this morning. You\u0027ll need some more clothes. I\u0027ll see to that. Keep awake. We\u0027ll get plenty of sleep in the grave. Be calling you.\u0027 He hung up. Bond smiled to himself. Hearing Leiter\u0027s cheerful voice and knowing everything was being taken care of had wiped away his exhaustion and his black memories. He picked up the telephone and talked to the Overseas operator. \u0027Ten minutes\u0027 delay, she said. Bond walked into his bedroom and somehow got out of his clothes. He gave himself a very hot shower and then an ice-cold one. He shaved and managed to pull on a clean shirt and trousers. He put a fresh clip in his Beretta and wrapped the Colt in his discarded shirt and put it in his suitcase. He was half way through his packing when the telephone rang. He listened to the zing and echo on the line, the chatter of distant operators, the patches of Morse from aircraft and ships at sea, quickly suppressed. He could see the big, grey building near Regents Park and imagine the busy switchboard and the cups of tea and a girl saying, \u0027Yes, this is Universal Export,\u0027 the address Bond had asked for, one of the covers used by agents for emergency calk on open lines from abroad. She would tell the Supervisor, who would take the call over. \u0027You\u0027re connected, caller,\u0027 said the Overseas operator. \u0027Go ahead, please. New York calling London.\u0027 Bond heard the calm English voice. \u0027Universal Export. Who\u0027s speaking, please?\u0027 \u0027Can I speak to the Managing Director,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027This is his nephew James speaking from New York.\u0027 \u0027Just a moment, please.\u0027 Bond could follow the call to Miss Moneypenny and see her press the switch on the intercom. \u0027It\u0027s New York, Sir,\u0027 she would say. \u0027I think it\u0027s 007.\u0027 \u0027Put him through,\u0027 M would say. \u0027Yes?\u0027 said the cold voice that Bond loved and obeyed. \u0027It\u0027s James, Sir,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I may need a bit of help over a difficult consignment.\u0027 \u0027Go ahead,\u0027 said the voice. \u0027I went uptown to see our chief customer last night,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Three of his best men went sick while I was there.\u0027 \u0027How sick?\u0027 asked the voice. \u0027As sick as can be, Sir,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027There\u0027s a lot of \u0027flu about.\u0027 \u0027Hope you didn\u0027t catch any.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve got a slight chill, Sir,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027but absolutely nothing to worry about. I\u0027ll write to you about it. The trouble is that with all this \u0027flu about Federated think I will do better out of town.\u0027 (Bond chuckled to himself at the thought of M\u0027s grin.) \u0027So I\u0027m off right away with Felicia.\u0027 \u0027Who?\u0027 asked M. \u0027Felicia,\u0027 Bond spelled it out. \u0027My new secretary from Washington.\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes.\u0027 \u0027Thought I\u0027d try that factory you advised at San Pedro.\u0027 \u0027Good idea.\u0027 \u0027But Federated may have other ideas and I hoped you\u0027d give me your support.\u0027 \u0027I quite understand,\u0027 said M. \u0027How\u0027s business?\u0027 \u0027Rather promising, Sir. But tough going. Felicia will be typing my full report today.\u0027 \u0027Good,\u0027 said M. \u0027Anything else?\u0027 \u0027No, that\u0027s all, Sir. Thanks for your support.\u0027 That\u0027s all right. Keep fit. Goodbye.\u0027 \u0027Goodbye, Sir.\u0027 Bond put down the telephone. He grinned. He could imagine M calling in the Chief of Staff, \u0027007\u0027s already tangled up with the FBI. Dam\u0027 fool went up to Harlem last night and bumped off three of Mr. Big\u0027s men. Got hurt himself, apparently, but not much. Got to get out of town with Leiter, the CIA man. Going down to St. Petersburg. Better warn A and C. Expect we\u0027ll have Washington round our ears before the day\u0027s over. Tell A to say I fully sympathize, but that 007 has my full confidence and I\u0027m sure he acted in self-defence. Won\u0027t happen again, and so forth. Got that?\u0027 Bond grinned again as he thought of Damon\u0027s exasperation at having to dish out a lot of soft soap to Washington when he probably had plenty of other Anglo-American snarls to disentangle. The telephone rang. It was Leiter again. \u0027Now listen,\u0027 he said. \u0027Everybody\u0027s calming down somewhat. Seems the men you got were a pretty nasty trio - Tee-Hee Johnson, Sam Miami and a man called McThing. All wanted on various counts. The F B I\u0027s covering up for you. Reluctantly of course, and the Police are stalling like mad. The FBI big brass had already asked my Chief for you to be sent home - got him out of bed, if you please - mostly jealousy, I guess - but we\u0027ve killed all that. Same time, we\u0027ve both got to quit town at once. That\u0027s all fixed too. We can\u0027t go together, so you\u0027re taking the train and I\u0027ll fly. Jot this down.\u0027 Bond cradled the telephone against his shoulder and reached for a pencil and paper. \u0027Go ahead,\u0027 he said. \u0027Pennsylvania Station. Track 14. Ten-thirty this morning. \"The Silver Phantom\". Through train to St. Petersburg via Washington, Jacksonville and Tampa. I\u0027ve got you a compartment. Very luxurious. Car 245, Compartment H. Ticket\u0027ll be on the train. Conductor will have it. In the name of Bryce. Just go to Gate 14 and down to the train. Then straight to your compartment and lock yourself in till the train starts. I\u0027m flying down in an hour by Eastern, so you\u0027ll be alone from now on. If you get stuck call Dexter, but don\u0027t be surprised if he bites your head off. Train gets in around midday tomorrow. Take a cab and go to the Everglades Cabanas, Gulf Boulevard West, on Sunset Beach. That\u0027s on a place called Treasure Island where all the beach hotels are. Connected with St. Petersburg by a causeway. Cabby\u0027ll know it. Til be waiting for you. Got all that? And for God\u0027s sake watch out. And I mean it. The Big Man\u0027ll get you if he possibly can and a police escort to the train would only put the finger on you. Take a cab and keep out of sight. I\u0027m sending you up another hat and a fawn raincoat. The check\u0027s taken care of at the St. Regis. That\u0027s the lot. Any questions?\u0027 \u0027Sounds fine,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I\u0027ve talked to M and he\u0027ll square Washington if there\u0027s any trouble. Look after yourself too,\u0027 he added. \u0027You\u0027ll be next on the list after me. See you tomorrow. So long.\u0027 Til watch out,\u0027 said Leiter. \"Bye.\u0027 It was half-past six and Bond pulled back the curtains in the sitting-room and watched the dawn come up over the city. It was still dark down in the caverns below but the tips of the great concrete stalagmites were pink and the sun lit up the windows floor by floor as if an army of descending janitors was at work in the buildings. The police surgeon came, stayed for a painful quarter of an hour and left. \u0027Clean fracture,\u0027 he had said. \u0027Take a few days to heal. How did you come by it?\u0027 \u0027Caught it in a door,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027You ought to keep away from doors,\u0027 commented the surgeon. \u0027They\u0027re dangerous things. Ought to be forbidden by law. Lucky you didn\u0027t catch your neck in this one.\u0027 When he had gone, Bond finished packing. He was wondering how soon he could order breakfast when the telephone rang. Bond was expecting a harsh voice from the Police or the FBI. Instead, a girl\u0027s voice, low and urgent, asked for Mr. Bond. \u0027Who\u0027s calling?\u0027 asked Bond, gaining time. He knew the answer. \u0027I know it\u0027s you,\u0027 said the voice, and Bond could feel that it was right up against the mouthpiece. \u0027This is Solitaire.\u0027 The name was scarcely breathed into the telephone. Bond waited, all his senses pricked to what might be the scene at the other end of the line. Was she alone? Was she speaking foolishly on a house-phone with extensions to which other listeners were now coldly, intently glued? Or was she in a room with only Mr. Big\u0027s eyes bent carefully on her, a pencil and pad beside him so that he could prompt the next question? \u0027Listen,\u0027 said the voice. I\u0027ve got to be quick. You must trust me. I\u0027m in a drugstore, but I must get back at once to my room. Please believe me.\u0027 Bond had his handkerchief out. He spoke into it. \u0027If I can reach Mr. Bond what shall I tell him?\u0027 \u0027Oh damn you,\u0027 said the girl with what sounded like a genuine touch of hysteria. \u0027I swear by my mother, by my unborn children. I\u0027ve got to get away. And so have you. You\u0027ve got to take me. I\u0027ll help you. I know a lot of his secrets. But be quick. I\u0027m risking my life here talking to you.\u0027 She gave a sob of exasperation and panic. \u0027For God\u0027s sake trust me. You must. You must!\u0027 Bond still paused, his mind working furiously. \u0027Listen,\u0027 she spoke again, but this time dully, almost hopelessly. \u0027If you don\u0027t take me, I shall kill myself. Now will you? Do you want to murder me?\u0027 If it was acting, it was too good acting. It was still an unpardonable gamble, but Bond decided. Fie spoke directly into the telephone, his voice low. \u0027If this is a double-cross, Solitaire, I\u0027ll get at you and kill you if it\u0027s the last thing I do. Have you got a pencil and paper?\u0027 \u0027Wait,\u0027 said the girl, excitedly. \u0027Yes, yes.\u0027 If it had been a plant, reflected Bond, all that would have been ready. \u0027Be at Pennsylvania Station at ten-twenty exactly. The Silver Phantom to…\u0027 he hesitated. \u0027… to Washington. Car 245, Compartment H. Say you\u0027re Mrs. Bryce. Conductor has the ticket in case I\u0027m not there already. Go straight to the compartment and wait for me. Got that?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the girl, \u0027and thank you, thank you.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be seen,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Wear a veil or something.\u0027 \u0027Of course,\u0027 said the girl. \u0027I promise. I really promise. I must go.\u0027 She rang off. Bond looked at the dead receiver, then put it down on the cradle. \u0027Well,\u0027 he said aloud. \u0027That\u0027s torn it.\u0027 He got up and stretched. He walked to the window and looked out, seeing nothing. His thoughts raced. Then he shrugged and turned back to the telephone. He looked at his watch. It was seven-thirty. \u0027Room Service, good morning,\u0027 said the golden voice. \u0027Breakfast, please,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Pineapple juice, double. Cornflakes and cream. Shirred eggs with bacon. Double portion of Cafe Espresso. Toast and marmalade.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Sir,\u0027 said the girl. She repeated the order. \u0027Right away.\u0027 \u0027Thank you.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re welcome.\u0027 Bond grinned to himself. \u0027The condemned man made a hearty breakfast,\u0027 he reflected. He sat down by the window and gazed up at the clear sky, into the future. Up in Harlem, at the big switchboard, The Whisper was talking to the town again, passing Bond\u0027s description again to all Eyes : \u0027All de railroads, all de airports. Fifth Avenue an\u0027 55th Street doors of da San Regis. Mr. Big sez we gotta chance da highways. Pass it down da line.
