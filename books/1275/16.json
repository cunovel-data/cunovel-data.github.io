{"id":33297,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI THE JAMAICA VERSION","content":"IT was two o\u0027clock in the morning. Bond eased his car away from the sea-wall and moyed off through the town on to 4th Street, the highway to Tampa. \n He dawdled along down the four-lane concrete highway through the endless gauntlet of motels, trailer camps and roadside emporia selling beach furniture, sea-shells and concrete gnomes. \n He stopped at the \u0027Gulf Winds Bar and Snacks\u0027 and ordered a double Old Grandad on the rocks. While the barman poured it he went into the washroom and cleaned himself up. The bandages on his left hand were covered with dirt and the hand throbbed painfully. The splint had broken on The Robber\u0027s stomach. There was nothing Bond could do about it. His eyes were red with strain and lack of sleep. He went back to the bar, drank down the Bourbon and ordered another one. The barman looked like a college kid spending his holidays the hard way. He wanted to talk but there was no talk left in Bond. Bond sat and looked into his glass and thought about Leiter and The Robber and heard the sickening grunt of the feeding shark. \n He paid and went out and on again over the Gandy Bridge, and the air of the Bay was cool on his face. At the end of the bridge he turned left towards the airport and stopped at the first motel that looked awake. \n The middle-aged couple that owned the place were listening to late rhumba music from Cuba with a bottle of rye between them. Bond told a story of a blow-out on his way from Sarasota to Silver Springs. They weren\u0027t interested. They were just glad to take his ten dollars. He drove his car up to the door of Room 5 and the man unlocked the door and turned on the light. There was a double bed and a shower and a chest-of-drawers and two chairs. The motif was white and blue. It looked clean and Bond put his bag down thankfully and said good night. He stripped and threw his clothes unfolded on to a chair. Then he took a quick shower, cleaned his teeth and gargled with a sharp mouthwash and climbed into bed. \n He plunged at once into a calm untroubled sleep. It was the first night since he had arrived in America that did not threaten a fresh battle with his stars on the morrow. \n He awoke at midday and walked down the road to a cafeteria where the short-order cook fixed him a delicious three-decker western sandwich and coffee. Then he came back to his room and wrote a detailed report to the FBI at Tampa. He omitted all reference to the gold in the poison tanks for fear that The Big Man would close down his operations in Jamaica. The nature of these had still to be discovered. Bond knew that the damage he had done to the machine in America had no bearing on the heart of his assignment - the discovery of the source of the gold, its seizure, and the destruction, if possible, of Mr. Big himself. \n He drove to the airport and caught the silver, four-engined plane with a few minutes to spare. He left Leiter\u0027s car in the parking space as in his report he had told the FBI he would. He guessed that he need not have mentioned it to the FBI when he saw a man in an unnecessary raincoat hanging round the souvenir shop, buying nothing. Raincoats seemed almost the badge of office of the FBI. Bond was certain they wanted to see he caught the plane. They would be glad to see the last of him. Wherever he had gone in America he had left dead bodies. Before he boarded the plane he called the hospital in St. Petersburg. He wished he hadn\u0027t; Leiter was still unconscious and there was no news. Yes, they would cable him when they had something definite. \n It was five in the evening when they circled over Tampa Bay and headed East. The sun was low on the horizon. A big jet from Pensacola swept by, well to port, leaving four trails of vapour that hung almost motionless in the still air. Soon it would complete its training circuit and go in to land, back to the Gulf Coast packed with oldsters in Truman shirts. Bond was glad to be on his way to the soft green flanks of Jamaica and to be leaving behind the great hard continent of Eldollarado. \n The plane swept on across the waist of Florida, across the acres of jungle and swamp without sign of human habitation, its wing-lights blinking green and red in the gathering dark. Soon they were over Miami and the monster chump-traps of the Eastern Seaboard, their arteries ablaze with Neon. Away to port, State Highway No.1 disappeared up the coast in a golden ribbon of motels, gas stations and fruit-juice stands, up through Palm Beach and Daytona to Jacksonville, three hundred miles away. Bond thought of the breakfast he had had at Jacksonville not three days before and of all that had happened since. Soon, after a short stop at Nassau, he would be flying over Cuba, perhaps over the hideout where Mr. Big had put her away. She would hear the noise of the plane and perhaps her instincts would make her look up towards the sky and feel that for a moment he was nearby. \n Bond wondered if they would ever meet again and finish what they had begun. But that would have to come later, when his work was over - the prize at the end of the dangerous road that had started three weeks before in the fog of London. \n After a cocktail and an early dinner they came in to Nassau and spent half an hour on the richest island in the world, the sandy patch where a thousand million pounds of frightened sterling lies buried beneath the Canasta tables and where bungalows surrounded by a thin scurf of screw-pine and casuarina change hands at fifty thousand pounds a piece. \n They left the platinum whistle-stop behind and were soon crossing the twinkling mother-of-pearl lights of Havana, so different in their pastel modesty from the harsh primary colours of American cities at night. \n They were flying at fifteen thousand feet when, just after crossing Cuba, they ran into one of those violent tropical storms that suddenly turn aircraft from comfortable drawing-rooms into bucketing death-traps. The great plane staggered and plunged, its screws now roaring in vacuum and now biting harshly into walls of solid air. The thin tube shuddered and swung. Crockery crashed in the pantry and huge rain hammered on the perspex windows. \n Bond gripped the arms of his chair so that his left hand hurt and cursed softly to himself. \n He looked at the racks of magazines and thought: they won\u0027t help much when the steel tires at fifteen thousand feet, nor will the eau-de-cologne in the washroom, nor the personalized meals, the free razor, the \u0027orchid for your lady\u0027 now trembling in the ice-box. Least of all the safety-belts and the life-jackets with the whistle that the steward demonstrates will really blow, nor the cute little rescue-lamp that glows red. \n No, when the stresses are too great for the tired metal, when the ground mechanic who checks the de-icing equipment is crossed in love and skimps his job, way back in London, Idlewild, Gander, Montreal; when those or many things happen, then the little warm room with propellers in front falls straight down out of the sky into the sea or on to the land, heavier than air, fallible, vain. And the forty little heavier-than-air people, fallible within the plane\u0027s fallibility, vain within its larger vanity, fall down with it and make little holes in the land or little splashes in the sea. Which is anyway their destiny, so why worry? You are linked to the ground mechanic\u0027s careless fingers in Nassau just as you are linked to the weak head of the little man in the family saloon who mistakes the red light for the green and meets you head-on, for the first and last time, as you are motoring quietly home from some private sin. There\u0027s nothing to do about it. You start to die the moment you are born. The whole of life is cutting through the pack with death. So take it easy. Light a cigarette and be grateful you are still alive as you suck the smoke deep into your lungs. Your stars have already let you come quite a long way since you left your mother\u0027s womb and whimpered at the cold air of the world. Perhaps they\u0027ll even let you get to Jamaica tonight. Can\u0027t you hear those cheerful voices in the control tower that have said quietly all day long, \u0027Come in BOAC. Come in Panam. Come in K L M \u0027? Can\u0027t you hear them calling you down too : \u0027Come in Transcarib. Come in Transcarib\u0027? Don\u0027t lose faith in your stars. Remember that hot stitch of time when you faced death from The Robber\u0027s gun last night. You\u0027re still alive, aren\u0027t you? There, we\u0027re out of it already. It was just to remind you that being quick with a gun doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re really tough. Just don\u0027t forget it. This happy landing at Palisadoes Airport comes to you by courtesy of your stars. Better thank them. \n Bond unfastened his seat-belt and wiped the sweat off his face. \n To hell with it, he thought, as he stepped down out of the huge strong plane. \n Strangways, the chief Secret Service agent for the Caribbean, was at the airport to meet him and he was quickly through the Customs and Immigration and Finance \n Control. \n It was nearly eleven and the night was quiet and hot. There was the shrill sound of crickets from the dildo cactus on both sides of the airport road and Bond gratefully drank in the sounds and smells of the tropics as the military pick-up cut across the corner of Kingston and took them up towards the gleaming, moonlit foothills of the Blue Mountains. \n They talked in monosyllables until they were settled on the comfortable veranda of Strangways\u0027s neat white house on the Junction Road below Stony Hill. \n Strangways poured a strong whisky-and-soda for both of them and then gave a concise account of the whole of the Jamaica end of the case. \n He was a lean, humorous man of about thirty-five, a former Lieutenant-Commander in the Special Branch of the RNVR. He had a black patch over one eye and the sort of aquiline good looks that are associated with the bridges of destroyers. But his face was heavily lined under its tan and Bond sensed from his quick gestures and clipped sentences that he was nervous and highly strung. He was certainly efficient and he had a sense of humour, and he showed no signs of jealousy at someone from headquarters butting in on his territory. Bond felt that they would get on well together and he looked forward to the partnership. This was the story that Strangways had to tell. It had always been rumoured that there was treasure on the Isle of Surprise and everything that was known about Bloody Morgan supported the rumour. \n The tiny island lay in the exact centre of Shark Bay, a small harbour that lies at the end of the Junction Road that runs across the thin waist of Jamaica from Kingston to the north coast. \n The great buccaneer had made Shark Bay his headquarters. He liked to have the whole width of the island between himself and the Governor at Port Royal so that he could slip in and out of Jamaican waters in complete secrecy. The Governor also liked the arrangement. The Crown wished a blind eye to be turned on Morgan\u0027s piracy until the Spaniards had been cleared out of the Caribbean. When this was accomplished, Morgan was rewarded with a Knighthood and the Governorship of Jamaica. Till then, his actions had to be disavowed to avoid a European war with Spain. \n So, for the long period before the poacher turned gamekeeper, Morgan used Shark Bay as his sallyport. He built three houses on the neighbouring estate, christened Llanrumney after his birthplace in Wales. These houses were called \u0027Morgan\u0027s\u0027, The Doctor\u0027s\u0027 and The Lady\u0027s\u0027. Buckles and coins are still turned up in the ruins of them. \n His ships always anchored in Shark Bay and he careened them in the lee of the Isle of Surprise, a precipitous lump of coral and limestone that surges straight up out of the centre of the bay and is surmounted by a jungly plateau of about an acre. \n When, in 1683, he left Jamaica for the last time, it was under open arrest to be tried by his peers for flouting the Crown. His treasure was left behind somewhere in Jamaica and he died in penury without revealing its whereabouts. It must have been a vast hoard, the fruits of countless raids on Hispaniola, of the capture of innumerable treasure-ships sailing for The Plate, of the sacking of Panama and the looting of Maracaibo. But it vanished without trace. \n It was always thought that the secret lay somewhere on the Isle of Surprise, but for two hundred years the diving and digging of treasure-hunters yielded nothing. Then, said Strangways, just six months before, two things had happened within a few weeks. A young fisherman disappeared from the village of Shark Bay, and had not been heard of since, and an anonymous New York syndicate purchased the island for a thousand pounds from the present owner of the Llanrumney Estate, which was now a rich banana and cattle property. \n A few weeks after the sale, the yacht Secatur put in to Shark Bay and dropped anchor in Morgan\u0027s old anchorage in the lee of the island. It was manned entirely by negroes. They went to work and cut a stairway in the rock face of the island and erected on the summit a number of low-lying shacks in the fashion known in Jamaica as \u0027wattle-and-daub\u0027. \n They appeared to be completely equipped with provisions, and all they purchased from the fishermen of the bay was fresh fruit and water. \n They were a taciturn and orderly lot who gave no trouble. They explained to the Customs which they had cleared in the neighbouring Port Maria that they were there to catch tropical fish, especially the poisonous varieties, and collect rare shells for Ourobouros Inc. in St. Petersburg. When they had established themselves they purchased large quantities of these from the Shark Bay, Port Maria and Oracabessa fishermen. \n For a week they carried out blasting operations on the island and it was given out that these were for the purpose of excavating a large fish-tank. \n The Secatur began a fortnightly shuttle-service with the Gulf of Mexico and watchers with binoculars confirmed that, before each sailing, consignments of portable fish-tanks were taken aboard. Always half a dozen men were left behind. Canoes approaching the island were warned off by a watchman, at the base of the steps in the cliff, who fished all day from a narrow jetty alongside which the Secatur on her visits moored with two anchors out, well sheltered from the prevailing north-easterly winds. \n No one succeeded in landing on the island by daylight and, after two tragic attempts, nobody tried to gain access by night. \n The first attempt was made by a local fisherman spurred on by the rumours of buried treasure that no talk of tropical fish could suppress. He had swum out one dark night and his body had been washed back over the reef next day. Sharks and barracuda had left nothing but the trunk and the remains of a thigh. \n At about the time he should have reached the island the whole village of Shark Bay was awakened by the most horrible drumming noise. It seemed to come from inside the island. It was recognized as the beating of Voodoo drums. It started softly and rose slowly to a thunderous crescendo. Then it died down again and stopped. It lasted about five minutes. j \n From that moment the island was ju-ju, or obeah, as it is called hi Jamaica, and even in daylight canoes kept at a safe distance. \n By this time Strangways was interested and he made a full report to London. Since 1950 Jamaica had become an important strategic target, thanks to the development by Reynolds Metal and the Kaiser Corporation of huge bauxite deposits found on the island. So far as Strangways was concerned, the activities on Surprise might easily be the erection of a base for one-man submarines in the event of war, particularly since Shark Bay was within range of the route followed by the Reynolds ships to the new bauxite harbour at Ocho Rios, a few miles down the coast. \n London followed the report up with Washington and it came to light that the New York syndicate that had purchased the island was wholly owned by Mr. Big. \n This was three months ago. Strangways was ordered to penetrate the island at all costs and find out what was going on. He mounted quite an operation. He rented a property on the western arm of Shark Bay called Beau Desert. It contained the ruins of one of the famous Jamaican Great Houses of the early nineteenth century and also a modern beach-house directly across from the Secatur\u0027s anchorage up against Surprise. \n He brought down two very fine swimmers from the naval base at Bermuda and set up a permanent watch on the island through day- and night-glasses. Nothing of a suspicious nature was seen and on a dark calm night he sent out the two swimmers with instructions to make an underwater survey of the foundations of the island. \n Strangways described his horror when, an hour after they had left to swim across the three hundred yards of water, the terrible drumming had started up somewhere inside the cliffs of the island. \n That night the two men did not return. \n On the next day they were both washed up at different parts of the bay. Or rather, the remains left by the shark and barracuda. \n At this point in Strangeways\u0027s narrative, Bond interrupted him. \n \u0027Just a minute,\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s all this about shark and barracuda? They\u0027re not generally savage in these waters. There aren\u0027t very many of them round Jamaica and they don\u0027t often feed at night. Anyway, I don\u0027t believe either of them attack humans unless there\u0027s blood in the water. Occasionally they might snap at a white foot out of curiosity. Have they ever behaved like this round Jamaica before?\u0027 \n \u0027Never been a case since a girl got a foot bitten off in Kingston harbour in 1942,\u0027 said Strangways. \u0027She was being towed by a speedboat, flipping her feet up and down. The white feet must have looked particularly appetising. Travelling at just the right speed too. Everyone agrees with your theory. And my men had harpoons and knives. I thought I\u0027d done everything to protect them. Dreadful business. You can imagine how I felt about it. Since then we\u0027ve done nothing except try to get legitimate access to the island via the Colonial Office and Washington. You see, it belongs to an American now. Damn slow business, particularly as there\u0027s nothing against these people. They seem to have pretty good protection in Washington and some smart international lawyers. We\u0027re absolutely stuck. London told me to hang on until you came.\u0027 Strangways took a pull at his whisky and looked expectantly at Bond. \n \u0027What are the Secatur\u0027s movements ?\u0027 asked Bond. \n \u0027Still in Cuba. Sailing in about a week, according to the CIA.\u0027 \n \u0027How many trips has she done?\u0027 \n \u0027About twenty.\u0027 \n Bond multiplied one hundred and fifty thousand dollars by twenty. If his guess was right, Mr. Big had already taken a million pounds in gold out of the island. \n \u0027I\u0027ve made some provisional arrangements for you,\u0027 said Strangways. \u0027There\u0027s the house at Beau Desert. I\u0027ve got you a car, Sunbeam Talbot coupe. New tyres. Fast. Right car for these roads. I\u0027ve got a good man to act as your factotum. A Cayman Islander called Quarrel. Best swimmer and fisherman in the Caribbean. Terribly keen. Nice chap. And I\u0027ve borrowed the West Indian Citrus Company\u0027s rest-house at Manatee Bay. It\u0027s the other end of the island. You could rest up there for a week and get in a bit of training until the Secatur comes in. You\u0027ll need to be fit if you\u0027re going to try to get over to Surprise, and I honestly believe that\u0027s the only answer. Anything else I can do? I\u0027ll be about, of course, but I\u0027ll have to stay around Kingston to keep up communications with London and Washington. They\u0027ll want to know everything we do. Anything else you\u0027d like me to fix up?\u0027 \n Bond had been making up his mind. \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027You might ask London to get the Admiralty to lend us one of their frogmen suits complete with compressed-air bottles. Plenty of spares. And a couple of good underwater harpoon guns. The French ones called \u0027\u0027Champion\" are the best. Good underwater torch. A commando dagger. All the dope they can get from the Natural History Museum on barracuda and shark. And some of that shark-repellent stuff the Americans used in the Pacific. Ask B o A c to fly it all out on their direct service.\u0027 \n Bond paused. \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027And one of those things our saboteurs used against ships in the war. Limpet mine, with assorted fuses.\u0027 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565/46415.html","bookId":1275,"book":{"id":1275,"title":"007之生死关头 Live And Let Die","description":"简介： 讲述了007詹姆斯邦德奉命调查三名英国情报人员在美国遇害事件，而邦德必须对抗走私海洛因的Mr. Big和他的巫毒教信徒的故事。007接到一单新任务，英国三名情报人员在美国遇害，英政府却无法查出凶手，007赶赴异邦调查真相，意外发现这宗案件不仅与邪恶的巫术有关，还牵涉...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/25/14-08-39-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
