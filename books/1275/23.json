{"id":33304,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII PASSIONATE LEAVE","content":"LIKE dangling emerald pendants the two humming-birds were making their last rounds of the hibiscus and a mocking bird had started on its evening song, sweeter than a nightingale\u0027s, from the summit of a bush of night-scented jasmine. \\n\\n The jagged shadow of a man-of-war bird floated across the green Bahama grass of the lawn as it sailed on the air currents up the coast to some distant colony, and a slate-blue kingfisher chattered angrily as it saw the man sitting in the chair in the garden. It changed its flight and swerved off across the sea to the island. A brimstone butterfly flirted among the purple shadows under the palms. \\n\\n The graded blue waters of the bay were quite still. The cliffs of the island were a deep rose in the light of the setting sun behind the house. \\n\\n There was a smell of evening and of coolness after a hot day and a slight scent of peat-smoke that came from cassava being roasted in one of the fishermen\u0027s huts in the village away to the right. \\n\\n Solitaire came out of the house and walked on naked feet across the lawn. She was carrying a tray with a cocktail shaker and two glasses. She put it down on a bamboo table beside Bond\u0027s chair. \\n\\n \u0027I hope I\u0027ve made it right,\u0027 she said. \u0027Six to one sounds terribly strong. I\u0027ve never had Vodka Martinis before.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond looked up at her. She was wearing a pair of his white silk pyjamas. They were far too large for her. She looked absurdly childish. \\n\\n She laughed. \u0027How do you like my Port Maria lipstick?\u0027 she asked, \u0027and the eyebrows made up with an HB pencil. I couldn\u0027t do anything with the rest of me except wash it.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You look wonderful,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027You\u0027re far the prettiest girl in the whole of Shark Bay. If I had some legs and arms I\u0027d get up and kiss you.\u0027 \\n\\n Solitaire bent down and kissed him long on the lips, one arm tightly round his neck. She stood up and smoothed back the comma of black hair that had fallen down over his forehead. \\n\\n They looked at each other for a moment, then she turned to the table and poured him out a cocktail. She poured half a glass for herself and sat down on the warm grass and put her head against his knee. He played with her hair with his right hand and they sat for a while looking out between the trunks of the palm trees at the sea and the light fading on the island. \\n\\n The day had been given over to licking wounds and cleaning up the remains of the mess. \\n\\n When Quarrel had landed them on the little beach at Beau Desert, Bond had half carried Solitaire across the lawn and into the bathroom. He had filled the bath full of warm water. Without her knowing what was happening he had soaped and washed her whole body and her hair. When he had cleaned away all the salt and coral slime he helped her out, dried her and put merthiolate on the coral cuts that striped her back and thighs. Then he gave her a sleeping draught and put her naked between the sheets in his own bed. He kissed her. Before he had finished closing the jalousies she was asleep. \\n\\n Then he got into the bath and Strangways soaped him down and almost bathed his body in merthiolate. He was raw and bleeding in a hundred places and his left arm was numb from the barracuda bite. He had lost a mouthful of muscle at the shoulder. The sting of the merthiolate made him grind his teeth. \\n\\n He put on a dressing-gown and Quarrel drove him to the hospital at Port Maria. Before he left he had a Lucullian breakfast and a blessed first cigarette. He fell asleep in the car and he slept on the operating table and in the cot where they finally put him, a mass of bandages and surgical tape. \\n\\n Quarrel brought him back in the early afternoon. By that time Strangways had acted on the information Bond had given him. There was a police detachment on the Isle of Surprise, the wreck of the Secatur, lying in about twenty fathoms, was buoyed and the position being patrolled by the Customs launch from Port Maria. The salvage tug and divers were on their way from Kingston. Reporters from the local press had been given a brief statement and there was a police guard on the entrance to Beau Desert prepared to repel the flood of newspapermen who would arrive in Jamaica when the full story got out to the world. Meanwhile a detailed report had gone to M, and to Washington, so that The Big Man\u0027s team in Harlem and St. Petersburg could be rounded up and provisionally held on a blanket gold-smuggling charge. \\n\\n There were no survivors from the Secatur, but the local fishermen had brought in nearly a ton of dead fish that morning. \\n\\n Jamaica was aflame with rumours. There were serried ranks of cars on the cliffs above the bay and along the beach below. Word had got out about Bloody Morgan\u0027s treasure, but also about the packs of shark and barracuda that had defended it, and because of them there was not a swimmer who was planning to get out to the scene of the wreck under cover of darkness. \\n\\n A doctor had been to visit Solitaire but had found her chiefly concerned about getting some clothes and the right shade of lipstick. Strangways had arranged for a selection to be sent over from Kingston next day. For the time being she was experimenting with the contents of Bond\u0027s suitcase and a bowl of hibiscus. \\n\\n Strangways got back from Kingston shortly after Bond\u0027s return from hospital. He had a signal for Bond from M. It read: \\n\\n PRESUME YOU HAVE FILED CLAIM TO TREASURE IN YOUR NAME BEHALF UNIVERSAL EXPORT STOP PROCEED IMMEDIATELY WITH SALVAGE STOP HAVE ENGAGED COUNSEL TO PRESS OUR RIGHTS WITH TREASURY AND COLONIAL OFFICE STOP MEANWHILE VERY WELL DONE STOP FORTNIGHT\u0027S PASSIONATE LEAVE GRANTED ENDIT \\n\\n \u0027I suppose he means \"Compassionate\",\u0027 said Bond. \\n\\n Strangways looked solemn. \u0027I expect so,\u0027 he said. \u0027I made a full report of the damage to you. And to the girl,\u0027 he added. \\n\\n \u0027Hm,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027M\u0027s cipherenes don\u0027t often pick a wrong group. However.\u0027 \\n\\n Strangways looked carefully out of the window with his one eye. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s so like the old devil to think of the gold first,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Suppose he thinks he can get away with it and somehow dodge a reduction in the Secret Fund when the next parliamentary estimates come round. I expect half his life is taken up with arguing with the Treasury. But still he\u0027s been pretty quick off the mark.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I filed your claim at Government House directly I got the signal,\u0027 said Strangways. \u0027But it\u0027s going to be tricky. The Crown will be after it and America will come in somewhere as he was an American citizen. It\u0027ll be a long business.\u0027 \\n\\n They had talked some more and then Strangways had left and Bond had walked painfully out into the garden to sit for a while in the sunshine with his thoughts. \\n\\n In his mind he ran once more the gauntlet of dangers he had entered on his long chase after The Big Man and the fabulous treasure, and he lived again through the searing flashes of time when he had looked various deaths in the face. \\n\\n And now it was over and he sat in the sunshine among the flowers with the prize at his feet and his hand in her long black hair. He clasped the moment to him and thought of the fourteen tomorrows that would be theirs between them. \\n\\n There was a crash of broken crockery from the kitchen at the back of the house and the sound of Quarrel\u0027s voice thundering at someone. \\n\\n \u0027Poor Quarrel,\u0027 said Solitaire. \u0027He\u0027s borrowed the best cook in the village and ransacked the markets for surprises for us. He\u0027s even found some black crabs, the first of the season. Then he\u0027s roasting a pitiful little sucking pig and making an avocado pear salad and we\u0027re to finish up with guavas and coconut cream. And Commander Strangways has left a case of the best champagne in Jamaica. My mouth\u0027s watering already. But don\u0027t forget it\u0027s supposed to be a secret. I wandered into the kitchen and found he had almost reduced the cook to tears.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s coming with us on our passionate holiday,\u0027 said Bond. He told her of M\u0027s cable. \u0027We\u0027re going to a house on stilts with palm trees and five miles of golden sand. And you\u0027ll have to look after me very well because I shan\u0027t be able to make love with only one arm.\u0027 \\n\\n There was open sensuality in Solitaire\u0027s eyes as she looked up at him. She smiled innocently. \\n\\n \u0027What about my back?\u0027 she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565/46422.html","bookId":1275,"book":{"id":1275,"title":"007之生死关头 Live And Let Die","description":"简介： 讲述了007詹姆斯邦德奉命调查三名英国情报人员在美国遇害事件，而邦德必须对抗走私海洛因的Mr. Big和他的巫毒教信徒的故事。007接到一单新任务，英国三名情报人员在美国遇害，英政府却无法查出凶手，007赶赴异邦调查真相，意外发现这宗案件不仅与邪恶的巫术有关，还牵涉...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/25/14-08-39-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
