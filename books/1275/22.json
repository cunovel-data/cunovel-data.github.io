{"id":33303,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII TERROR BY SEA","content":"IT was not yet light when their guards came for them. Their leg ropes were cut and with their arms still pinioned they were led up the remaining stone stairs to the surface. \n They stood amongst the sparse trees and Bond sniffed the cool morning air. He gazed through the trees towards the east and saw that there the stars were paler and the horizon luminous with the breaking dawn. The night-song of the crickets was almost done and somewhere on the island a mocking bird bubbled its first notes. \n He guessed that it was either side of half-past five. \n They stood there for several minutes. Negroes brushed past them carrying bundles and jippa-jappa holdalls, talking in cheerful whispers. The doors of the handful of thatched huts among the trees had been left swinging open. The men filed to the edge of the cliff to the right of where Bond and Solitaire were standing and disappeared over the edge. They didn\u0027t come back. It was evacuation. The whole garrison of the island was decamping. \n Bond rubbed his naked shoulder against Solitaire and she pressed against him. It was cold after the stuffy dungeon and Bond shivered. But it was better to be on the move than for the suspense down below to be prolonged. \n They both knew what had to be done, the nature of the gamble. \n When The Big Man had left them, Bond had wasted no time. In a whisper, he had told the girl of the limpet mine against the side of the ship timed to explode a few minutes after six o\u0027clock and he had explained the factors that would decide who would die that morning. \n First, he gambled on Mr. Big\u0027s mania for exactitude and efficiency. The Secatur must sail on the dot of six o\u0027clock. Then there must be no cloud, or visibility hi the half-light of dawn would not be sufficient for the ship to make the passage through the reef and Mr. Big would postpone the sailing. If Bond and Solitaire were on the jetty alongside the ship, they would then be killed with Mi. Big. \n Supposing the ship sailed dead on time, how far behind and to one side of her would their bodies be towed? It would have to be on the port side for the paravane to clear the island. Bond guessed the cable to the paravane would be fifty yards and that they would be towed twenty or thirty yards behind the paravane. \n If he was right, they would be hauled over the outer reef about fifty yards after the Secatur had cleared the passage. She would probably approach the passage at about three knots and then put on speed to ten or even twenty. At first their bodies would be swept away from the island in a slow arc, twisting and turning at the end of the tow-rope. Then the paravane would straighten out and when the ship had got through the reef, they would still be approaching it. The paravane would then cross the reef when the ship was about forty yards outside it and they would follow. \n Bond shuddered to think of the mauling their bodies would suffer being dragged at any speed over the razor-sharp ten yards of coral rocks and trees. The skin on their backs and legs would be flayed off. \n Once over the reef they would be just a huge bleeding bait and it would be only a matter of minutes before the first shark or barracuda was on to them. \n And Mr. Big would sit comfortably in the stern sheets, watching the bloody show, perhaps with glasses, and ticking off the seconds and minutes as the living bait got smaller and smaller and finally the fish snapped at the bloodstained rope. \n Until there was nothing left. \n Then the paravane would be hoisted inboard and the yacht would plough gracefully on towards the distant Florida Keys, Cape Sable and the sun-soaked wharf in St. Petersburg Harbour. \n And if the mine exploded while they were still in the water, only fifty yards away from the ship? What would be the effect of the shock-waves on their bodies? It might not be deadly. The hull of the ship should absorb most of it. The reef might protect them. \n Bond could only guess and hope. \n Above all they must stay alive to the last possible second. They must keep breathing as they were hauled, a living bundle, through the sea. Much depended on how they would be bound together. Mr. Big would want them to stay alive. He would not be interested hi dead bait. \n If they were still alive when the first shark\u0027s fin showed on the surface behind them Bond had coldly decided to drown Solitaire. Drown her by twisting her body under his and holding her there. Then he would try and drown himself by twisting her dead body back over his to keep him under. \n There was nightmare at every turn of his thoughts, sickening horror in every grisly aspect of the monstrous torture and death this man had invented for them. But Bond knew he must remain cold and absolutely resolved to fight for their lives to the end. There was at least warmth in the knowledge that Mr. Big and most of his men would also die. And there was a glimmer of hope that he and Solitaire would survive. Unless the mine failed, there was no such hope for the enemy. \n All this, and a hundred other details and plans went through Bond\u0027s mind in the last hour before they were brought up the shaft to the surface. He shared all his hopes with Solitaire. None of his fears. \n She had lain opposite him, her tired blue eyes fixed on him, obedient, trusting, drinking in his face and his words, pliant, loving. \n \u0027Don\u0027t worry about me, my darling,\u0027 she had said when the men came for them. \u0027I am happy to be with you again. My heart is full of it. For some reason I am not afraid although there is much death very close. Do you love me a little?\u0027 \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027And we shall have our love.\u0027 \n \u0027Giddap,\u0027 said one of the men. \n And now, on the surface, it was getting lighter, and from below the cliff Bond heard the great twin Diesels stutter and roar. There was a light flutter of breeze to windward, but to leeward, where the ship lay, the bay was a gunmetal mirror. \n Mr. Big appeared up the shaft, a businessman\u0027s leather brief-case in his hand. He stood for a moment looking round, gaining his breath. He paid no attention to Bond and Solitaire nor to the two guards standing beside them with revolvers in their hands. \n He looked up at the sky, and suddenly called out, in a loud clear voice, towards the rim of the sun: \n \u0027Thank you, Sir Henry Morgan. Your treasure will be well spent. Give us a fair wind.\u0027 \n The negro guards showed the whites of their eyes. \n \u0027The Undertaker\u0027s Wind it is,\u0027 said Bond. \n The Big Man looked at him. \n \u0027All down?\u0027 he asked the guards. \n \u0027Yassuh, Boss,\u0027 answered one of them. \n \u0027Take them along,\u0027 said The Big Man. \n They went to the edge of the cliff and down the steep steps, one guard in front, one behind. Mr. Big followed. \n The engines of the long graceful yacht were turning over quietly, the exhaust bubbling glutinously, a thread of blue vapour rising astern. \n There were two men on the jetty at the guide ropes. There were only three men on deck besides the Captain and the navigator on the grey streamlined bridge. There was no room for more. All the available deckspace, save for a fishing chair rigged right aft, was covered with fish-tanks. The Red Ensign had been struck and only the Stars and Stripes hung motionless at the stern. \n A few yards clear of the ship the red torpedo-shaped paravane, about six foot long, lay quietly on the water, now aquamarine in the early dawn. It was attached to a thick pile of wire cable, coiled up on the deck aft. To Bond there looked to be a good fifty yards of it. The water was crystal clear and there were no fish about. \n The Undertaker\u0027s Wind was almost dead. Soon the Doctor\u0027s Wind would start to breathe in from the sea. How soon? wondered Bond. Was it an omen? \n Away beyond the ship he could see the roof of Beau Desert among the trees, but the jetty and the ship and the cliff path were still in deep shadow. Bond wondered if night-glasses would be able to pick them out. And if they could, what Strangways would be thinking. \n Mr. Big stood on the jetty and supervised the process of binding them together. \n \u0027Strip her,\u0027 he said to Solitaire\u0027s guard. \n Bond flinched. He stole a glance at Mr. Big\u0027s wrist watch. It said ten minutes to six. Bond kept silence. There must not be even a minute\u0027s delay. \n \u0027Throw the clothes on board,\u0027 said Mr. Big. \u0027Tie some strips round his shoulder. I don\u0027t want any blood in the water, yet.\u0027 \n Solitaire\u0027s clothes were cut off her with a knife. She stood pale and naked. She hung her head and the heavy black hair fell forward over her face. Bond\u0027s shoulder was roughly bound with strips of her linen skirt. \n \u0027You bastard,\u0027 said Bond through his teeth. \n Under Mr. Big\u0027s direction, their hands were freed. Their bodies were pressed together, face to face, and their arms held round each other\u0027s waists and then bound tightly again. \n Bond felt Solitaire\u0027s soft breasts pressed against him. She leant her chin on his right shoulder. \n \u0027I didn\u0027t want it to be like this,\u0027 she whispered tremulously. \n Bond didn\u0027t answer. He hardly felt her body. He was counting seconds. \n On the jetty there was a pile of rope to the paravane. It hung down off the jetty and Bond could see it lying along the sand until it rose to meet the belly of the red torpedo. \n The free end was tied under their armpits and knotted tightly between them in the space between their necks. It was all very carefully done. There was no possible escape. \n Bond was counting the seconds. He made it five minutes to six. \n Mr. Big had a last look at them. \n \u0027Their legs can stay free,\u0027 he said. \u0027They\u0027ll make appetizing bait.\u0027 He stepped off the jetty on to the deck of the yacht.\u0027 \n The two guards went aboard. The two men on the jetty unhitched their lines and followed. The screws churned up the still water and with the engines at half speed ahead the Secatur slid swiftly away from the island. \n Mr. Big went aft and sat down in the fishing chair. They could see his eyes fixed on them. He said nothing. Made no gesture. He just watched. \n The Secatur cut through the water towards the reef. Bond could see the cable to the paravane snaking over the side. The paravane started to move softly after the ship. Suddenly it put its nose down, then righted itself and sped away, its rudder pulling out and away from the wake of the ship. \n The coil of rope beside them leapt into life. \n \u0027Look out,\u0027 said Bond urgently, holding tighter to the girl. \n Their arms were pulled almost out of their sockets as they were jerked together off the jetty into the sea. \n For a second they both went under, then they were on the surface, their joined bodies smashing through the water. \n Bond gasped for breath amongst the waves and spray that dashed past his twisted mouth. He could hear the rasping of Solitaire\u0027s breath next to his ear. \n \u0027Breathe, breathe,\u0027 he shouted through the rushing of the water. \u0027Lock your legs against mine.\u0027 \n She heard him and he felt her knees pressing between his thighs. She had a paroxysm of coughing, then her breath became more even against his ear and the thumping of her heart eased against his breast. At the same time their speed slackened. \n \u0027Hold your breath,\u0027 shouted Bond. \u0027I\u0027ve got to have a look. Ready?\u0027 \n A pressure of her arms answered him. He felt her chest heave as she filled her lungs. \n With the weight of his body he swung her round so that his head was now quite out of water. \n They were ploughing along at about three knots. He twisted his head above the small bow-wave they were throwing up. \n The Secatur was entering the passage through the reef, about eighty yards away, he guessed. The paravane was skimming slowly along almost at right angles to her. Another thirty yards and the red torpedo would be crossing the broken water over the reef. A further thirty yards behind, they were riding slowly across the surface of the bay. \n Sixty yards to go to the reef. \n Bond twisted his body and Solitaire came up, gasping. \n Still they moved slowly along through the water. \n Five yards, ten, fifteen, twenty. \n Only forty yards to go before they hit the coral. \n The Secatur would be just through. Bond gathered his breath. It must be past six now. What had happened to the blasted mine? Bond thought a quick fervent prayer. God save us, he said into the water. \n Suddenly he felt the rope tighten under his arms. \n \u0027Breathe, Solitaire, breathe,\u0027 he shouted as they got under way and the water started to hiss past them. \n Now they were flying over the sea towards the crouching reef. \n There was a slight check. Bond guessed that the paravane had fouled a niggerhead or a piece of surface coral. Then their bodies hurtled on again in their deadly embrace. \n Thirty yards to go, twenty, ten. \n Jesus Christ, thought Bond. We\u0027re for it. He braced his muscles to take the crashing, searing pain, edged Solitaire further above him to protect her from the worst of it. \n Suddenly the breath whistled out of his body and a giant fist thumped him into Solitaire so that she rose right out of the sea above him and then fell back. A split second later lightning flashed across the sky and there was the thunder of an explosion. \n They stopped dead in the water and Bond felt the weight of the slack rope pulling them under. \n His legs sank down beneath his stunned body and water rushed into his mouth. \n It was this that brought him back to consciousness. His legs pounded under him and brought their mouths to the surface. The girl was a dead weight in his arms. He trod water desperately and looked round him, holding Solitaire\u0027s lolling head on his shoulder above the surface. \n The first thing he saw was the swirling waters of the reef not five yards away. Without its protection they would both have been crushed by the shock-wave of the explosion. He felt the tug and eddy of its currents round his legs. He backed desperately towards it, catching gulps of air when he could. His chest was bursting with the strain and he saw the sky through a red film. The rope dragged him down and the girl\u0027s hair filled his mouth and tried to choke him. \n Suddenly he felt the sharp scrape of the coral against the back of his legs. He kicked and felt frantically with his feet for a foothold, flaying the skin off with every movement. \n He hardly felt the pain. \n Now his back was being scraped and his arms. He floundered clumsily, his lungs burning in his chest. Then there was a bed of needles under his feet. He put all his weight on it, leaning back against the strong eddies that tried to dislodge him. His feet held and there was rock at his back. He leant back panting, blood streaming up around him in the water, holding the girl\u0027s cold, scarcely breathing body against him. \n For a minute he rested, blessedly, his eyes shut and the blood pounding through his limbs, coughing painfully, waiting for his senses to focus again. His first thought was for the blood in the water around him. But he guessed the big fish would not venture into the reef. Anyway there was nothing he could do about it. \n Then he looked out to sea. \n There was no sign of the Secatur. \n High up in the still sky there was a mushroom of smoke, beginning to trail, with the Doctor\u0027s Wind, in towards the land. \n There were things strewn all over the water and a few heads bobbing up and down and the whole sea was glinting with the white stomachs of fish stunned or killed by the explosion. There was a strong smell of explosive in the air. On the fringe of the debris, the red paravane lay quietly, hull down, anchored by the cable whose other end must lie somewhere on the bottom. Fountains of bubbles were erupting on the glassy surface of the sea. \n On the edge of the circle of bobbing heads and dead fish a few triangular fins were cutting fast through the water. More appeared as Bond watched. Once he saw a great snout come out of the water and smash down on something. The fins threw up spray as they flashed among the tidbits. Two black arms suddenly stuck up in the air and then disappeared. There were screams. Two or three pairs of arms started to flail the water towards the reef. One man stopped to bang the water in front of him with the flat of his hand. Then his hands disappeared under the surface. Then he too began to scream and his body jerked to and fro in the water. Barracuda hitting into him, said Bond\u0027s dazed mind. \n But one of the heads was getting nearer, making for the bit of reef where Bond stood, the small waves breaking under his armpits, the girl\u0027s black hair hanging down his back. \n It was a large head and a veil of blood streamed down over the face from a wound in the great bald skull. \n Bond watched it come on. \n The Big Man was executing a blundering breast-stroke, making enough flurry in the water to attract any fish that wasn\u0027t already occupied. \n Bond wondered whether he would make it. Bond\u0027s eyes narrowed and his breath became calmer as he watched the cruel sea for its decision. \n The surging head came nearer. Bond could see the teeth showing in a rictus of agony and frenzied endeavour. Blood half veiled the eyes that Bond knew would be bulging in their sockets. He could almost hear the great diseased heart thumping under the grey-black skin. Would it give out before the bait was taken? \n The Big Man came on. His shoulders were naked, his clothes stripped off him by the explosion, Bond supposed, but the black silk tie had remained and it showed round the thick neck and streamed behind the head like a Chinaman\u0027s pigtail. \n A splash of water cleared some blood away from the eyes. They were wide open, staring madly towards Bond. They held no appeal for help, only a fixed glare of physical exertion. \n Even as Bond looked into them, now only ten yards away, they suddenly shut and the^ great face contorted in a grimace of pain. \n \u0027Aarrh,\u0027 said the distorted mouth. \n Both arms stopped flailing the water and the head went under and came up again. A cloud of blood welled up and darkened the sea. Two six-foot thin brown shadows backed out of the cloud and then dashed back into it. The body in the water jerked sideways. Half of The Big Man\u0027s left arm came out of the water. It had no hand, no wrist, no wrist watch. \n But the great turnip head, the drawn-back mouth full of white teeth almost splitting it in half, was still alive. And now it was screaming, a long gurgling scream that only broke each time a barracuda hit into the dangling body. \n There was a distant shout from the bay behind Bond. He paid no attention. All his senses were focused on the horror in the water in front of him. \n A fin split the surface a few yards away and stopped. \n Bond could feel the shark pointing like a dog, the shortsighted pink button eyes trying lo pierce the cloud of blood and weigh up the prey. Then it shot in towards the chest and the screaming head went under as sharply as a fisherman\u0027s float. \n Some bubbles burst on the surface. \n There was the swirl of a sharp brown-spotted tail as the huge Leopard shark backed out to swallow and attack again. \n The head floated back to the surface. The mouth was closed. The yellow eyes seemed still to look at Bond. \n Then the shark\u0027s snout came right out of the water and it drove in towards the head, the lower curved jaw open so that light glinted on the teeth. There was a horrible grunting scrunch and a great swirl of water. Then silence. \n Bond\u0027s dilated eyes went on staring at the brown stain that spread wider and wider across the sea. \n Then the girl moaned and Bond came to his senses. \n There was another shout from behind him and he turned his head towards the bay. \n It was Quarrel, his brown gleaming chest towering above the slim hull of a canoe, his arms flailing at the paddle, and a long way behind him all the other canoes of Shark Bay skimming like water-boatmen across the small waves that had started to ripple the surface. \n The fresh north-east trade winds had started to blow and the sun was shining down on the blue water and on the soft green flanks of Jamaica. \n The first tears since his childhood came into James Bond\u0027s blue-grey eyes and ran down his drawn cheeks into the bloodstained sea. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565/46421.html","bookId":1275,"book":{"id":1275,"title":"007之生死关头 Live And Let Die","description":"简介： 讲述了007詹姆斯邦德奉命调查三名英国情报人员在美国遇害事件，而邦德必须对抗走私海洛因的Mr. Big和他的巫毒教信徒的故事。007接到一单新任务，英国三名情报人员在美国遇害，英政府却无法查出凶手，007赶赴异邦调查真相，意外发现这宗案件不仅与邪恶的巫术有关，还牵涉...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/25/14-08-39-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
