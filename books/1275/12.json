{"id":33293,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII THE EVERGLADES","content":"IT was around five o\u0027clock in the morning when they slipped off the train at Jacksonville. \n It was still dark and the naked platforms of the great Florida junction were sparsely lit. The entrance to the subway was only a few yards from Car 245 and there was no sign of life on the sleeping train as they dived down the steps. Bond had told the attendant to keep the door of their compartment locked after they had gone and the blinds drawn and he thought there was quite a chance they would not be missed until the train reached St. Petersburg. \n They came out of the subway into the booking-hall. Bond verified that the next express for St. Petersburg would be the Silver Meteor, the sister train of the Phantom, due at about nine o\u0027clock, and he booked two Pullman seats on it. Then he took Solitaire\u0027s arm and they walked out of the station into the warm dark street. \n There were two or three all-night diners to choose from and they pushed through the door that announced \u0027Good Eats\u0027 in the brightest neon. It was the usual sleazy food-machine - two tired waitresses behind a zinc counter loaded with cigarettes and candy and paper-backs and comics. There was a big coffee percolator and a row of butane gas-rings. A door marked \u0027Restroom\u0027 concealed its dreadful secrets next to a door marked \u0027Private\u0027 which was probably the back entrance. A group of overalled men at one of the dozen stained crueted tables looked up briefly as they came in and then resumed their low conversation. Relief crews for the Diesels, Bond guessed. \n There were four narrow booths on the right of the entrance and Bond and Solitaire slipped into one of them. They looked dully at the stained menu card. \n After a time, one of the waitresses sauntered over and stood leaning against the partition, running her eyes over Solitaire\u0027s clothes. \n \u0027Orange juice, coffee, scrambled eggs, twice,\u0027 said Bond briefly. \n \u0027Kay,\u0027 said the girl. Her shoes lethargically scuffed the floor as she sauntered away. \n \u0027The scrambled eggs\u0027ll be cooked with milk,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027But one can\u0027t eat boiled eggs in America. They look so disgusting without their shells, mixed up in a tea-cup the way they do them here. God knows where they learned the trick. From Germany, I suppose. And bad American coffee\u0027s the worst in the world, worse even than in England. I suppose they can\u0027t do much harm to the orange juice. After all we are in Florida now.\u0027 He suddenly felt depressed by the thought of their four-hour wait in this unwashed, dog-eared atmosphere. \n \u0027Everybody\u0027s making easy money in America these days,\u0027 said Solitaire. \u0027That\u0027s always bad for the customer. All they want is to strip a quick dollar off you and toss you out. Wait till you get down to the coast. At this time of the year, Florida\u0027s the biggest sucker-trap on earth. On the East Coast they fleece the millionaires. Where we\u0027re going they just take it off the little man. Serves him right, of course. He goes there to die. He can\u0027t take it with him.\u0027 \n \u0027For heaven\u0027s sake,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027what sort of a place are we going to?\u0027 \n \u0027Everybody\u0027s nearly dead in St. Petersburg,\u0027 explained Solitaire. \u0027It\u0027s the Great American Graveyard. When the bank clerk or the post-office worker or the railroad conductor reaches sixty he collects his pension or his annuity and goes to St. Petersburg to get a few years\u0027 sunshine before he dies. It\u0027s called \"The Sunshine City\". The weather\u0027s so good that the evening paper there, The Independent, is given away free any day the sun hasn\u0027t shone by edition time. It only happens three or four times a year and it\u0027s a fine advertisement. Everybody goes to bed around nine o\u0027clock in the evening and during the day the old folks play shuffleboard and bridge, herds of them. There\u0027s a couple of baseball teams down there, the \"Kids\" and the \"Kubs\", all over seventy-five! Then they play bowls, but most of the time they sit squashed together in droves on things called \"Sidewalk Davenports\", rows of benches up and down the sidewalks of the main streets. They just sit in the sun and gossip and doze. It\u0027s a terrifying sight, all these old people with their spectacles and hearing-aids and clicking false-teeth.\u0027 \n \u0027Sounds pretty grim,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Why the hell did Mr. Big choose this place to operate from?\u0027 \n \u0027It\u0027s perfect for him,\u0027 said Solitaire seriously. \u0027There\u0027s practically no crime, except cheating at bridge and Canasta. So there\u0027s a very small police force. There\u0027s quite a big Coastguard Station but it\u0027s mainly concerned with smuggling between Tampa and Cuba, and sponge-fishing out of season at Tarpon Springs. I don\u0027t really know what he does there except that he\u0027s got a big agent called \"The Robber\". Something to do with Cuba, I expect,\u0027 she added thoughtfully. \u0027Probably mixed up with Communism. I believe Cuba conies under Harlem and runs red agents all through the Caribbean. \n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 she went on, \u0027St. Petersburg is probably the most innocent town in America. Everything\u0027s very \"folksy\" and \"gracious\". It\u0027s true there\u0027s a place called \"The Res-torium\", a hospital for alcoholics. But very old ones, I suppose,\u0027 she laughed, \u0027and I expect they\u0027re past doing anyone any harm. You\u0027ll love it,\u0027 she smiled maliciously at Bond. \u0027You\u0027ll probably want to settle down there for life and be an \"Oldster\" too. That\u0027s the great word down there… \"oldster\".\u0027 \n \u0027God forbid,\u0027 said Bond fervently. \u0027It sounds rather like Bournemouth or Torquay. But a million times worse. I hope we don\u0027t get into a shooting match with \"The Robber\" and his friends. We\u0027d probably hurry a few hundred oldsters off to the cemetery with heart-failure. But isn\u0027t there anyone young in this place?\u0027 \n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 laughed Solitaire. \u0027Plenty of them. All the local inhabitants who take the money off the oldsters, for instance. The people who own the motels and the trailer-camps. You could make plenty of money running the bingo tournaments. I\u0027ll be your \"barker\" - the girl outside who gets the suckers in. Dear Mr. Bond,\u0027 she reached over and pressed his hand, \u0027will you settle down with me and grow old gracefully in St. Petersburg?\u0027 \n Bond sat back and looked at her critically. \u0027I want a long time of disgraceful living with you first,\u0027 he said with a grin. \u0027I\u0027m probably better at that. But it suits me that they go to bed at nine down there.\u0027 \n Her eyes smiled back at him. She took her hand away from his as their breakfast arrived. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027You go to bed at nine. Then I shall slip out by the back door and go on the tiles with the Kids and the Kubs.\u0027 \n The breakfast was as bad as Bond had prophesied. \n When they had paid they wandered over to the station waiting-room. \n The sun had risen and the light swarmed in dusty bars into the vaulted, empty hall. They sat together in a corner and until the Silver Meteor came in Bond plied her with questions about The Big Man and all she could tell him about his operations. \n Occasionally he made a note of a date or a name but there was little she could add to what he knew. She had an apartment to herself in the same Harlem block as Mr. Big and she had been kept virtually a prisoner there for the past year. She had two tough negresses as \u0027companions\u0027 and was never allowed out without a guard. \n From time to time Mr. Big would have her brought over to the room where Bond had seen him. There she would be told to divine whether some man or woman, generally bound to the chair, was lying or not. She varied her replies according to whether she sensed these people were good or evil. She knew that her verdict might often be a death sentence but she felt indifferent to the fate of those she judged to be evil. Very few of them were white. \n Bond jotted down the dates and details of all these occasions. \n Everything she told him added to the picture of a very powerful and active man, ruthless and cruel, commanding a huge network of operations. \n All she knew of the gold coins was that she had several times had to question men on how many they had passed and the price they had been paid for them. Very often, she said, they were lying on both counts. \n Bond was careful to divulge-very little of what he himself knew or guessed. His growing warmth towards Solitaire and his desire for her body were in a compartment which had no communicating door with his professional life. \n The Silver Meteor came in on time and they were both relieved to be on their way again and to get away from the dreary world of the big junction. \n The train sped on down through Florida, through the forests and swamps, stark and bewitched with Spanish moss, and through the mile upon mile of citrus groves. \n All through the centre of the state the moss lent a dead, spectral feeling to the landscape. Even the little townships through which they passed had a grey skeletal aspect with their dried-up, sun-sucked clapboard houses. Only the citrus groves laden with fruit looked green and alive. Everything else seemed baked and desiccated with the heat. \n Looking out at the gloomy silent withered forests, Bond thought that nothing could be living in them except bats and scorpions, horned toads and black widow spiders. \n They had lunch and then suddenly the train was running along the Gulf of Mexico, through the mangrove swamps and palm groves, endless motels and caravan sites, and Bond caught the smell of the other Florida, the Florida of the advertisements, the land of \u0027Miss Orange Blossom I954\u0027. \n They left the train at Clearwater, the last station before St. Petersburg. Bond took a cab and gave the address on Treasure Island, half an hour\u0027s drive away. It was two o\u0027clock and the sun blazed down out of a cloudless sky. Solitaire insisted on taking off her hat and veil. \u0027It\u0027s sticking to my face,\u0027 she said. \u0027Hardly a soul has ever seen me down here.\u0027 \n \n A big negro with a face pitted with ancient smallpox was held up in his cab at the same time as they were checked at the intersection of Park Street and Central Avenue, where the Avenue runs on to the long Treasure Island causeway across the shallow waters of Boca Ciega Bay. \n When the negro saw Solitaire\u0027s profile his mouth fell open. He pulled his cab into the kerb and dived into a drugstore. He called a St. Petersburg number. \n \u0027Dis is Poxy,\u0027 he said urgently into the mouthpiece. \u0027Gimme da Robber\u0027n step on it. Dat you, Robber? Lissen, Da Big Man muss be n\u0027town. Whaddya mean yuh jes talked wit him \u0027n New York? Ah jes seen his gal \u0027n a Clear-water cab, one of da Stassen Company\u0027s. Headin\u0027 over da Causeway. Sho Ahm sartin. Cross ma heart. Couldn mistake dat eyeful. Wid a man \u0027n a blue suit, grey Stetson. Seemed like a scar down his face. Whaddya mean, follow \u0027em? Ah jes couldn believe yuh wouldn tell me da Big Man wuz \u0027n town ef he wuz. Thought mebbe Ahd better check \u0027n make sho. Okay, okay. Ah\u0027ll ketch da cab when he comes back over da Causeway, else at Clearwater. Okay, okay. Keep yo shirt on. Ah ain\u0027t done nuthen wrong.\u0027 \n The man called \u0027The Robber\u0027 was through to New York in five minutes. He had been warned about Bond but he couldn\u0027t understand where Solitaire tied in to the picture. When he had finished talking to The Big Man he still didn\u0027t know, but his instructions were quite definite. \n He rang off and sat for a while drumming his fingers on his desk. Ten Grand for the job. He\u0027d need two men. That would leave eight Grand for him. He licked his lips and called a poolroom in a downtown bar in Tampa. \n \n Bond paid off the cab at The Everglades, a group of neat white-and-yellow clapboard cottages set on three sides of a square of Bahama grass which ran fifty yards down to a bone-white beach and then to the sea. From there, the whole Gulf of Mexico stretched away, as calm as a mirror, until the heat-haze on the horizon married it into the cloudless sky. \n After London, after New York, after Jacksonville, it was a sparkling transition. \n Bond went through a door marked \u0027Office\u0027 with Solitaire demurely at his heels. He rang a bell that said, \u0027Manageress : Mrs. Stuyvesant\u0027, and a withered shrimp of a woman with blue-rinsed hair appeared and smiled with her pinched lips. \u0027Yes?\u0027 \n \u0027Mr. Leiter?\u0027 \n \u0027Oh yes, you\u0027re Mr. Bryce. Cabana Number One, right down on the beach. Mr. Leiter\u0027s been expecting you since lunchtime. And…?\u0027 She heliographed with her pince-nez towards Solitaire. \n \u0027Mrs. Bryce,\u0027 said Bond. \n \u0027Ah yes,\u0027 said Mrs. Stuyvesant, wishing to disbelieve. \u0027Well, if you\u0027d care to sign the register, I\u0027m sure you and Mrs. Bryce would like to freshen up after the journey. The full address, please. Thank you.\u0027 \n She led them out and down the cement path to the end cottage on the left. She knocked and Leiter appeared. Bond had looked forward to a warm welcome,-but Leiter seemed staggered to see him. His mouth hung open. His straw-coloured hair, still faintly black at the roots, looked like a haystack. \n \u0027You haven\u0027t met my wife, I think,\u0027 said Bond. \n \u0027No, no, I mean, yes. How do you do?\u0027 \n The whole situation was beyond him. Forgetting Solitaire, he almost dragged Bond through the door. At the last moment he remembered the girl and seized her with his other hand and pulled her in too, banging the door shut with his heel so that Mrs. Stuyvesant\u0027s \u0027I hope you have a happy…\u0027 was guillotined before the\u0027stay\u0027. \n Once inside, Leiter could still not take them in. He stood and gaped from one to the other. \n Bond dropped his suitcase on the floor of the little lobby. There were two doors. He pushed open the one on his right and held it for Solitaire. It was a small living-room that ran the width of the cottage and faced across the beach to the sea. It was pleasantly furnished with bamboo beach chairs upholstered in foam rubber covered with a red-and-green hibiscus chintz. Palrn-leaf matting covered the floor. The walls were duck\u0027s-egg blue and in the centre of each was a colour print of tropical flowers in a bamboo frame. There was a large drum-shaped table in bamboo with a glass top. It held a bowl of flowers and a white telephone. There were broad windows facing the sea and to the right of them a door leading on to the beach. White plastic jalousies were drawn half up the windows to cut the glare from the sand. \n Bond and Solitaire sat down. Bond lit a cigarette and threw the pack and his lighter on to the table. \n Suddenly the telephone rang. Leiter came out of his trance and walked over from the door and picked up the receiver. \n \u0027Speaking,\u0027 he said. \u0027Put the Lieutenant on. That you, Lieutenant? He\u0027s here. Just walked in. No, all in one piece.\u0027 He listened for a moment, then turned to Bond. \u0027Where did you leave the Phantom?\u0027 he asked. Bond told him. \u0027Jacksonville,\u0027 said Leiter into the telephone. \u0027Yeah, I\u0027ll say. Sure. I\u0027ll get the details from him and call you back. Will you call off Homicide? I\u0027d sure appreciate it. And New York. Much obliged, Lieutenant. Orlando 9000. Okay. And thanks again. \u0027Bye.\u0027 He put down the receiver. He wiped the sweat off his forehead and sat down opposite Bond. \n Suddenly he looked at Solitaire and grinned apologetically. \u0027I guess you\u0027re Solitaire,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sorry for the rough welcome. It\u0027s been quite a day. For the second time in around twenty-four hours I didn\u0027t expect to see this guy again.\u0027 He turned back to Bond. \u0027Okay to go ahead?\u0027 he asked. \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Solitaire\u0027s on our side now.\u0027 \n \u0027That\u0027s a break,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Well, you won\u0027t have seen the papers or heard the radio, so I\u0027ll give you the headlines first. The Phantom was stopped soon after Jacksonville. Between Waldo and Ocala. Your compartment was tommy-gunned and bombed. Blown to bits. Killed the Pullman porter who was in the corridor at the time. No other casualties. Bloody uproar going on. Who did it? Who\u0027s Mr. Bryce and who\u0027s Mrs. Bryce? Where are they? Of course we were sure you\u0027d been snatched. The police at Orlando are in charge. Traced the bookings back to New York. Found the FBI had made them. Everyone comes down on me like a load of bricks. Then you walk in with a pretty girl on your arm looking as happy as a clam.\u0027 \n Leiter burst out laughing. \u0027Boy! You should have heard \n Washington a while back. Anybody would have thought it was me that bombed the goddam train.\u0027 \n He reached for one of Bond\u0027s cigarettes and lit it. \n \u0027Well,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s the synopsis. I\u0027ll hand over the shooting script when I\u0027ve heard your end. Give.\u0027 \n Bond described in detail what had happened since he had spoken to Leiter from the St. Regis. When he came to the night on the train he took the piece of paper out of his pocket-book and pushed it across the table. \n Leiter whistled. \u0027Voodoo,\u0027 he said. \u0027This was meant to be found on the corpse, I guess. Ritual murder by friends of the men you bumped in Harlem. That\u0027s how it was supposed to look. Take the heat right away from The Big Man. They certainly think out all the angles. We\u0027ll get after that thug they had on the train. Probably one of the help in the diner. He must have been the man who put the finger on your compartment. You finish. Then I\u0027ll tell you how he did it.\u0027 \n \u0027Let me see,\u0027 said Solitaire. She reached across for the paper. \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027It\u0027s an ouanga, a Voodoo fetish. It\u0027s the invocation to the Drum Witch. It\u0027s used by the Ashanti tribe in Africa when they want to kill someone. They use something like it in Haiti.\u0027 She handed it back to Bond. \u0027It was lucky you didn\u0027t tell me about it,\u0027 she said seriously. \u0027I would still be having hysterics.\u0027 \n \u0027I didn\u0027t care for it myself,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I felt it was bad news. Lucky we got off at Jacksonville. Poor Baldwin. We owe him a lot.\u0027 \n He finished the story of the rest of their trip. \n \u0027Anyone spot you when you left the train?\u0027 asked Leiter. \n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027But we\u0027d better keep Solitaire under cover until we can get her out. Thought we ought to fly her over to Jamaica tomorrow. I can get her looked after there till we come on.\u0027 \n \u0027Sure,\u0027 agreed Leiter. \u0027We\u0027ll put her in a charter plane at Tampa. Get her down to Miami by tomorrow lunch-time and she can take one of the afternoon services - KLM or Panam. Get her in by dinner-time tomorrow. Too late to do anything this afternoon.\u0027 \n \u0027Is that all right, Solitaire?\u0027 Bond asked her. \n The girl was staring out of the window. Her eyes had the faraway look that Bond had seen before. \n Suddenly she shivered. \n Her eyes came back to Bond. She put out a hand and touched his sleeve. \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. She hesitated. \u0027Yes, I guess so.\u0027 \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565/46411.html","bookId":1275,"book":{"id":1275,"title":"007之生死关头 Live And Let Die","description":"简介： 讲述了007詹姆斯邦德奉命调查三名英国情报人员在美国遇害事件，而邦德必须对抗走私海洛因的Mr. Big和他的巫毒教信徒的故事。007接到一单新任务，英国三名情报人员在美国遇害，英政府却无法查出凶手，007赶赴异邦调查真相，意外发现这宗案件不仅与邪恶的巫术有关，还牵涉...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/25/14-08-39-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
