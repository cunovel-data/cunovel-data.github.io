{"id":33286,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V NIGGER HEAVEN","content":"At the bus stop at the corner of Fifth and Cathedral Parkway three negroes stood quietly under the light of a street lamp. They looked wet and bored. They were. They had been watching the traffic on Fifth since the call went out at four-thirty. \u0027Yo next, Fatso,\u0027 said one of them as the bus came up out of the rain and stopped with a sigh from the great vacuum brakes. \u0027Ahm tahd,\u0027 said the thick-set man in the mackintosh. But he pulled his hat down over his eyes and climbed aboard, slotted his coins and moved down the bus, scanning the occupants. He blinked as he saw the two white men, walked on and took the seat directly behind them. He examined the backs of their necks, their coats and hats and their profiles. Bond sat next to the window. The negro saw the reflection of his scar in the dark glass. He got up and moved to the front of the bus without looking back. At the next stop he got off the bus and made straight for the nearest drugstore. He shut himself into the paybox. Whisper questioned him urgently, then broke the connection. He plugged in on the right of the board. \u0027Yes?\u0027 said the deep voice. \u0027Boss, one of them\u0027s just come in on Fifth. The Limey with the scar. Got a friend with him, but he don\u0027t seem to fit the dope on the other two.\u0027 Whisper passed on an accurate description of Leiter. \u0027Coming north, both of them,\u0027 he gave the number and probable timing of the bus. There was a pause. \u0027Right,\u0027 said the quiet voice. \u0027Call off all Eyes on the other avenues. Warn the night spots that one of them\u0027s inside and get this to Tee-Hee Johnson, McThing, Blabbermouth Foley, Sam Miami and The Flannel…\u0027 The voice spoke for five minutes. \u0027Got that? Repeat.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Sir, Boss,\u0027 said The Whisper. He glanced at his shorthand pad and whispered fluently and without a pause into the mouthpiece. \u0027Right.\u0027 The line went dead. His eyes bright, The Whisper took up a fistful of plugs and started talking to the town. From the moment that Bond and Leiter walked under the canopy of Sugar Ray\u0027s on Seventh Avenue at 12 3rd Street there was a team of men and women watching them or waiting to watch them, speaking softly to The Whisper at the big switchboard on the Riverside Exchange, handing them on towards the rendezvous. In a world where they were naturally the focus of attention, neither Bond nor Leiter felt the hidden machine nor sensed the tension around them. In the famous night-spot the stools against the long bar were crowded, but one of the small booths against the wall was empty and Bond and Leiter slipped into the two seats with the narrow table between them. They ordered Scotch-and-soda - Haig and Haig Pinch-bottle. Bond looked the crowd over. It was nearly all men. There were two or three whites, boxing fans or reporters for the New York sports columns, Bond decided. The atmosphere was warmer, louder than downtown. The walls were covered with boxing photographs, mostly of Sugar Ray Robinson and of scenes from his great fights. It was a cheerful place, doing great business. \u0027He was a wise guy, Sugar Ray,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Let\u0027s hope we both know when to stop when the time comes. He stashed plenty away and now he\u0027s adding to his pile on the music halls. His percentage of this place must be worth a packet and he owns a lot of real estate around here. He works hard still, but it\u0027s not the sort of work that sends you blind or gives you a haemorrhage of the brain. He quit while he was still alive.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027ll probably back a Broadway show and lose it all,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027If I quit now and went in for fruit-farming in Kent, I\u0027d most likely hit the worst weather since the Thames froze over, and be cleaned out. One can\u0027t plan for everything.\u0027 \u0027One can try,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027But I know what you mean -better the frying-pan you know than the fire you don\u0027t. It isn\u0027t a bad life when it consists of sitting in a comfortable bar drinking good whisky. How do you like this corner of the jungle?\u0027 He leant forward. \u0027Just listen in to the couple behind you. From what I\u0027ve heard they\u0027re straight out of \"Nigger Heaven\".\u0027 Bond glanced carefully over his shoulder. The booth behind him contained a handsome young negro in an expensive fawn suit with exaggerated shoulders. He was lolling back against the wall with one foot up on the bench beside him. He was paring the nails of his left hand with a small silver pocket-knife, occasionally glancing in bored fashion towards the animation at the bar. His head rested on the back of the booth just behind Bond and a whiff of expensive hair-straightener came from him. Bond took in the artificial parting traced with a razor across the left side of the scalp, through the almost straight hair which was a tribute to his mother\u0027s constant application of the hot comb since childhood. The plain black silk tie and the white shirt were in good taste. Opposite him, leaning forward with concern on her pretty face, was a sexy little negress with a touch of white blood in her. Her jet-black hair, as sleek as the best permanent wave, framed a sweet almond-shaped face with rather slanting eyes under finely drawn eyebrows. The deep purple of her parted, sensual lips was thrilling against the bronze skin. All that Bond could see of her clothes was the bodice of a black satin evening dress, tight and revealing across the firm, small breasts. She wore a plain gold chain round her neck and a plain gold band round each thin wrist. She was pleading anxiously and paid no heed to Bond\u0027s quick embracing glance. \u0027Listen and see if you can get the hang of it,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027It\u0027s straight Harlem - Deep South with a lot of New York thrown in.\u0027 Bond picked up the menu and leant back in the booth, studying the Special Fried Chicken Dinner at $3.75. \u0027Cmon, honey,\u0027 wheedled the girl. \u0027How come yuh-all\u0027s actin\u0027 so tahd tonight?\u0027 \u0027Guess ah jist nacherlly gits tahd listenin\u0027 at yuh,\u0027 said the man languidly. \u0027Why\u0027nt yuh hush yo\u0027 mouff\u0027n let me \u0027joy mahself \u0027n peace \u0027n qui-yet.\u0027 \u0027Is yuh wan\u0027 me tuh go \u0027way, honey?\u0027 \u0027Yuh kin suit yo sweet self.\u0027 \u0027Aw, honey,\u0027 pleaded the girl. \u0027Don\u0027 ack mad at me, honey.

Dat Birdie Johnson, da maitre d\u0027, he permis me a ringside whenebber Ah come nex\u0027.\u0027 The man\u0027s voice suddenly sharpened. \u0027Wha\u0027 dat Birdie he mean tuh yuh, hey?\u0027 he asked suspiciously. Terzackly,\u0027 he paused to let the big word sink in, \u0027perzackly wha\u0027 goes\u0027tween yuh \u0027n dat lowdown ornery wuthless Nigguh? Yuh sleepin\u0027 wid him mebbe? Guess Ah gotta study \u0027bout dat little situayshun\u0027tween yuh an\u0027 Birdie Johnson. Mebbe git mahself a betterer gal. Ah jist don\u0027 lak gals which runs off ever\u0027 which way when Ah jist happen be busticated tem-poraneously. Yesmam. Ah gotta study \u0027bout dat little situayshun.\u0027 He paused threateningly. \u0027Sure have,\u0027 he added. \u0027Aw, honey,\u0027 the girl was anxious. \u0027 \u0027dey ain\u0027t no use tryin\u0027 tuh git mad at me. Ah done nuthen tuh give yuh recasion tuh ack dat way. Ah jist thunk you mebbe preshiate a ringside at da Par\u0027disc \u0027nstead of settin\u0027 hyah countin\u0027 yo troubles. Why, honey, yuh all knows Ah wudden fall fo\u0027 dat richcrat ack\u0027 of Birdie Johnson. No sir. He don\u0027 mean nuthen tuh me.

All da same, he permis me da bestess seats \u0027nda house \u0027n Ah sez let\u0027s us go set \u0027n dem, \u0027n have us a beer \u0027n a good time. Gmon, honey. Let\u0027s git out of hyah. Yuh done look so swell \u0027n Ah jist wan\u0027 mah frens tuh see usn together.\u0027 \u0027Yuh done look okay yoself, honeychile,\u0027 said the man, mollified by the tribute to his elegance, \u0027an\u0027 dat\u0027s da troof. But Ah mus\u0027 spressify dat yuh stays close up tuh me an keeps yo eyes offn dat lowdown trash \u0027n his hot pants. \u0027N Ah may say,\u0027 he added threateningly,\u0027 dat ef Ah ketches yuh makin\u0027 up tuh dat dope Ah\u0027ll jist nachrally whup da hide off\u0027n yo sweet ass.\u0027 \u0027Shoh ting, honey,\u0027 whispered the girl excitedly. Bond heard the man\u0027s foot scrape off the seat to the ground. \u0027Cmon, baby, lessgo. Waiduh!\u0027 Bond put down the menu. \u0027Got the gist of it,\u0027 he said. \u0027Seems they\u0027re interested in much the same things as everyone else - sex, having fun, and keeping up with the Jones\u0027s. Thank God they\u0027re not genteel about it.\u0027 \u0027Some of them are,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Tea-cups, aspidistras and tut-tutting all over the place. The Methodists are almost their strongest sect. Harlem\u0027s riddled with social distinctions, the same as any other big city, but with all the colour variations added. Gome on,\u0027 he suggested, \u0027let\u0027s go and get ourselves something to eat.\u0027 They finished their drinks and Bond called for the check. \u0027All this evening\u0027s on me,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve got a lot of money to get rid of and I\u0027ve brought three hundred dollars of it along with me.\u0027 \u0027Suits me,\u0027 said Leiter, who knew about Bond\u0027s thousand dollars. As the waiter was picking up the change, Leiter suddenly said, \u0027Know where The Big Man\u0027s operating tonight?\u0027 The waiter showed the whites of his eyes. He leant forward and flicked the table down with his napkin. \u0027I\u0027ve got a wife\u0027n kids, Boss,\u0027 he muttered out of the corner of his mouth. He stacked the glasses on his tray and went back to the bar. \u0027Mr. Big\u0027s got the best protection of all,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Fear.\" They went out on to Seventh Avenue. The rain had stopped, but \u0027Hawkins\u0027, the bone-chilling wind from the north which the negroes greet with a reverent \u0027Hawkins is here\u0027, had come instead to keep the streets free of their usual crowds. Leiter and Bond moved with the trickle of couples on the sidewalk. The looks they got were mostly contemptuous or frankly hostile. One or two men spat in the gutter when they had passed. Bond suddenly felt the force of what Leiter had told him. They were trespassing. They just weren\u0027t wanted. Bond felt the uneasiness that he had known so well during the war, when he had been working for a time behind the enemy lines. He shrugged the feeling away. \u0027We\u0027ll go to Ma Frazier\u0027s, further up the Avenue,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Best food in Harlem, or at any rate it used to be.\u0027 As they went along Bond gazed into the shop windows. He was struck by the number of barbers\u0027 saloons and \u0027beauticians\u0027. They all advertised various forms of hair-straightener - \u0027Apex Glossatina, for use with the hot comb\u0027, \u0027Silky Strate. Leaves no redness, no burn\u0027 - or nostrums for bleaching the skin. Next in frequency were the haberdashers and clothes shops, with fantastic men\u0027s snakeskin shoes, shirts with small aeroplanes as a pattern, peg-top trousers with inch-wide stripes, zoot suits. All the book shops were full of educational literature - how to learn this, how to do that - and comics. There were several shops devoted to lucky charms and various occultisms - Seven Keys to Power, \u0027The Strangest book ever written\u0027, with sub-titles such as: \u0027If you are CROSSED, shows you how to remove and cast it back.\u0027 \u0027Chant your desires in the Silent Tongue.\u0027 \u0027Cast a Spell on Anyone, no matter where.\u0027 \u0027Make any person Love you.\u0027 Among the charms were \u0027High John the Conqueror Root\u0027, \u0027Money Drawing Brand Oil\u0027, \u0027Sachet Powders, Uncrossing Brand\u0027, Tncense, Jinx removing Brand\u0027, and the \u0027Lucky Whamie Hand Charm, giving Protection from Evil. Confuses and Baffles Enemies\u0027. Bond reflected it was no wonder that the Big Man found Voodooism such a powerful weapon on minds that still recoiled at a white chicken\u0027s feather or crossed sticks in the road - right in the middle of the shining capital city of the Western world. \u0027I\u0027m glad we came up here,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I\u0027m beginning to get the hang of Mr. Big. One just doesn\u0027t catch the smell of all this in a country like England. We\u0027re a superstitious lot there of course - particularly the Celts - but here one can almost hear the drums.\u0027 Leiter grunted. \u0027I\u0027ll be glad to get back to my bed,\u0027 he said. \u0027But we need to size up this guy before we decide how to get at him.\u0027 Ma Frazier\u0027s was a cheerful contrast to the bitter streets. They had an excellent meal of Little Neck Clams and Fried Chicken Maryland with bacon and sweet corn. \u0027We\u0027ve got to have it,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027It\u0027s the national dish.\u0027 It was very civilized in the warm restaurant. Their waiter seemed glad to see them and pointed out various celebrities, but when Leiter slipped in a question about Mr. Big the waiter seemed not to hear. He kept away from them until they called for their bill. Leiter repeated the question. \u0027Sorry, Sah,\u0027 said the waiter briefly. \u0027Ah cain\u0027t recall a gemmun of dat name.\u0027 By the time they left the restaurant it was ten-thirty and the Avenue was almost deserted. They took a cab to the Savoy Ballroom, had a Scotch-and-soda, and watched the dancers. \u0027Most modern dances were invented here,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027That\u0027s how good it is. The Lindy Hop, Truckin\u0027, the Susie Q, the Shag. All started on that floor. Every big American band you\u0027ve ever heard of is proud that it once played here - Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Cab Galloway, Noble Sissle, Fletcher Henderson. It\u0027s the Mecca of jazz and jive.\u0027 They had a table near the rail round the huge floor. Bond was spellbound. He found many of the girls very beautiful. The music hammered its way into his pulse until he almost forgot what he was there for. \u0027Gets you, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Leiter at last. \u0027I could stay here all night. Better move along. We\u0027ll miss out Small\u0027s Paradise. Much the same as this, but not quite in the same class. Think I\u0027ll take you to \"Yeah Man\", back on Seventh. After that we must get moving to one of Mr. Big\u0027s own joints. Trouble is, they don\u0027t open till midnight. I\u0027ll pay a visit to the washroom while you get the check. See if I can get a line on where we\u0027re likely to find him tonight. We don\u0027t want to have to go to all his places.\u0027 Bond paid the check and met Leiter downstairs in the narrow entrance hall. Leiter drew him outside and they walked up the street looking for a cab. \u0027Cost me twenty bucks,\u0027 said Leiter, \u0027but the word is he\u0027ll be at The Boneyard. Small place on Lenox Avenue. Quite close to his headquarters. Hottest strip in town. Girl called G-G Sumatra. We\u0027ll have another drink at \"Yeah Man\" and hear the piano. Move on at about twelve-thirty.\u0027 The big switchboard, now only a few blocks away, was almost quiet. The two men had been checked in and out of Sugar Ray\u0027s, Ma Frazier\u0027s and the Savoy Ballroom. Midnight had them entering \u0027Yeah Man\u0027. At twelve-thirty the final call came and then the board was silent. Mr. Big spoke on the house-phone. First to the head waiter. \u0027Two white men coming in five minutes. Give them the Z table.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Sir, Boss,\u0027 said the head waiter. He hurried across the dance-floor to a table away on the right, obscured from most of the room by a wide pillar. It was next to the Service entrance but with a good view of the floor and the band opposite. It was occupied by a party of four, two men and two girls \u0027Sorry folks,\u0027 said the head waiter. \u0027Been a mistake. Table\u0027s reserved. Newspaper men from downtown.\u0027 One of the men began to argue. \u0027Move, Bud,\u0027 said the head waiter crisply. \u0027Lofty, show these folks to table F. Drinks is on the house. Sam,\u0027 he beckoned to another waiter, \u0027clear the table. Two covers.\u0027 The party of four moved docilely away, mollified by the prospect of free liquor. The head waiter put a Reserved sign on table Z, surveyed it and returned to his post at his table-plan on the high desk beside the curtained entrance. Meanwhile Mr. Big had made two more calls on the house-phone. One to the Master of Ceremonies. \u0027Lights out at the end of G-G\u0027s act.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Sir, Boss,\u0027 said the MC with alacrity. The other call was to four men who were playing craps in the basement. It was a long call, and very detailed.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565/46404.html","bookId":1275,"book":{"id":1275,"title":"007之生死关头 Live And Let Die","description":"简介： 讲述了007詹姆斯邦德奉命调查三名英国情报人员在美国遇害事件，而邦德必须对抗走私海洛因的Mr. Big和他的巫毒教信徒的故事。007接到一单新任务，英国三名情报人员在美国遇害，英政府却无法查出凶手，007赶赴异邦调查真相，意外发现这宗案件不仅与邪恶的巫术有关，还牵涉...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/25/14-08-39-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
