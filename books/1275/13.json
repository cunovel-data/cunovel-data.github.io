You must be dead beat. Guess you\u0027d better take James\u0027s room and he can bed down with me.\" \\n\\n Solitaire followed him out into the little hall and Bond heard Leiter explaining the arrangement of the rooms. \\n\\n In a moment Leiter came back with a bottle of Haig and Haig and some ice. \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m forgetting my manners,\u0027 he said. \u0027We could both do with a drink. There\u0027s a small pantry next the bathroom and I\u0027ve stocked it with all we\u0027re likely to need!\u0027 \\n\\n He fetched some soda-water and they both took a long drink. \\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s have the details,\u0027 said Bond, sitting back. \u0027Must have been the hell of a fine job.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Sure was,\u0027 agreed Leiter, \u0027except for the shortage of corpses.\u0027 \\n\\n He put his feet on the table and lit a cigarette. \\n\\n \u0027Phantom left Jacksonville around five,\u0027 he began. \u0027Got to Waldo around six. Just after leaving Waldo - and here I\u0027m guessing - Mr. Big\u0027s man comes along to your car, gets into the next compartment to yours and hangs a towel between the drawn blind and the window, meaning - and he must have done a good deal of telephoning at stations on the way down - meaning \"the window to the right of this towel is it\". \\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a long stretch of straight track between Waldo and Ocala,\u0027 continued Leiter, \u0027running through forest and swamp land. State highway right alongside the track. About twenty minutes outside Waldo, Wham! goes a dynamite emergency signal under the leading Diesel. Driver comes down to forty. Wham! And another Wham! Three in line! Emergency! Halt at once! He halts the train wondering what the hell. Straight track. Last signal green over green. Nothing in sight. It\u0027s around quarter after six and just getting light. There\u0027s a sedan, clouted heap I expect [Bond raised an eyebrow. \u0027Stolen car,\u0027 explained Leiter], grey, thought to have been a Buick, no lights, engine running, waiting on the highway opposite the centre of the train. Three men get out. Coloured. Probably negro. They walk slowly in line abreast along the grass verge between the road and the track. Two on the outside carry rippers - tommy-guns. Man in the centre has something in his hand. Twenty yards and they stop outside Car 245. Men with the rippers give a double squirt at your window. Open it up for the pineapple. Centre man tosses in the pineapple and all three run back to the car. Two seconds fuse. As they reach the car, BOOM! Fricassee of Compartment H. Fricassee, presumably, of Mr. and Mrs. Bryce. In fact fricassee of your Baldwin who runs out and crouches in corridor directly he sees men approaching his car. No other casualties except multiple shock and hysterics throughout train. Car drives away very fast towards limbo where it still is and will probably remain. Silence, mingled with screams, falls. People run to and fro. Train limps gingerly into Ocala. Drops Car 245. Is allowed to proceed three hours later. Scene II. Leiter sits alone in cottage, hoping he has never said an unkind word to his friend James, and wondering how Mr. Hoover will have Mr. Leiter served for his dinner tonight. That\u0027s all, folks.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond laughed. \u0027What an organization!\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m sure it\u0027s all beautifully covered up and alibied. What a man! He certainly seems to have the run of this country. Just shows how one can push a democracy around, what with habeas corpus and human rights and all the rest. Glad we haven\u0027t got him on our hands in England. Wooden truncheons wouldn\u0027t make much of a dent in him. Well,\u0027 he concluded,\u0027 that\u0027s three times I\u0027ve managed to get away with it. The pace is beginning to get a bit hot.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Leiter thoughtfully. \u0027Before you arrived over here you could have counted the mistakes Mr. Big has ever made on one thumb. Now he\u0027s made three all in a row. He won\u0027t like that. We\u0027ve got to put the heat on him while he\u0027s still groggy and then get out, quick. Tell you what I\u0027ve got in mind. There\u0027s no doubt that gold gets into the States through this place. We\u0027ve tracked the Secatur again and again and she just comes straight over from Jamaica to St. Petersburg and docks at that worm-and-bait factory - Rubberus or whatever it\u0027s called.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Ourobouros,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027The Great Worm of mythology. Good name for a worm-and-bait factory.\u0027 Suddenly a thought struck him. He hit the glass table-top with the flat of his hand. \u0027Felix! Of course. Ourobouros - \"The Robber\" - don\u0027t you see? Mr. Big\u0027s man down here. It must be the same.\u0027 \\n\\n Leiter\u0027s face lit up. \u0027Christ Almighty,\u0027 he exclaimed. \\n\\n \u0027Of course it\u0027s the same. That Greek who\u0027s supposed to own it, the man in Tarpon Springs that figures in the reports that blockhead showed us in New York, Binswanger. He\u0027s probably just a figurehead. Probably doesn\u0027t even know there\u0027s anything phoney about it. It\u0027s his manager here we\u0027ve got to get after. \"The Robber.\" Of course that\u0027s who it is.\u0027 \\n\\n Leiter jumped up. \\n\\n \u0027G\u0027mon. Let\u0027s get going. We\u0027ll go right along and look the place over. I was going to suggest it anyway, seeing the Secatur always docks at their wharf. She\u0027s in Cuba now, by the way,\u0027 he added, \u0027Havana. Cleared from here a week ago. They searched her good and proper when she came in and when she left. Didn\u0027t find a thing, of course. Thought she might have a false keel. Almost tore it off. She had to go into dock before she could sail again. Nix. Not a shadow of anything wrong. Let alone a stack of gold coins. Anyway, we\u0027ll go and smell around. See if we can get a look at our Robber friend. I\u0027ll just have to talk to Orlando and Washington. Tell \u0027em all we know. They must catch up quick with The Big Man\u0027s fellow on the train. Probably too late by now. You go and see how Solitaire\u0027s getting on. Tell her she\u0027s not to move till we get back. Lock her in. We\u0027ll take her out to dinner in Tampa. They\u0027ve got the best restaurant on the whole coast, Cuban, \"Los Novedades\". We\u0027ll stop at the airport on the way and fix her flight for tomorrow.\u0027 \\n\\n Leiter reached for the telephone and asked for Long Distance. Bond left him to it. \\n\\n Ten minutes later they were on their way. \\n\\n Solitaire had not wanted to be left. She had clung to Bond. \u0027I want to get away from here,\u0027 she said, her eyes frightened. \u0027I have a feeling…\u0027 She didn\u0027t end the sentence. Bond kissed her. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ll be back in an hour or so. Nothing can happen to you here. Then I shan\u0027t leave you until you\u0027re on the plane. We can even stay the night in Tampa and get you off at first light.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes, please,\u0027 said Solitaire anxiously. I\u0027d rather do that. I\u0027m frightened here. I feel in danger.\u0027 She put her arms round his neck. \u0027Don\u0027t think I\u0027m being hysterical.\u0027 She kissed him. \u0027Now you can go. I just wanted to see you. Gome back quickly.\u0027 \\n\\n Leiter had called and Bond had closed the door on her and locked it. \\n\\n He followed Leiter to his car on the Parkway feeling vaguely troubled. He couldn\u0027t imagine that the girl could come to any harm in this peaceful, law-abiding place, or that The Big Man could conceivably have traced her to The Everglades, which was only one of a hundred similar beach establishments on Treasure Island. But he respected the extraordinary power of her intuitions and her attack of nerves made him uneasy. \\n\\n The sight of Leiter\u0027s car put these thoughts out of his mind. \\n\\n Bond liked fast cars and he liked driving them. Most American cars bored him. They lacked personality and the patina of individual craftsmanship that European cars have. They were just Vehicles\u0027, similar in shape and in colour, and even in the tone of their horns. Designed to serve for a year and then be turned in in part exchange for the next year\u0027s model. All the fun of driving had been taken out of them with the abolition of a gear-change, with hydraulic-assisted steering and spongy suspension. All effort had been smoothed away and all of that close contact with the machine and the road that extracts skill and nerve from the European driver. To Bond, American cars were just beetle-shaped Dodgems in which you motored along with one hand on the wheel, the ladio full on, and the power-operated windows closed to keep out the draughts. \\n\\n But Leiter had got hold of an old Cord, one of the few American cars with a personality, and it cheered Bond to climb into the low-hung saloon, to hear the solid bite of the gears and the masculine tone of the wide exhaust. Fifteen years old, he reflected, yet still one of the most modern-looking cars in the world. \\n\\n They swung on to the causeway and across the wide expanse of unrippled water that separates the twenty miles of narrow island from the broad peninsula sprawling with St. Petersburg and its suburbs. \\n\\n Already as they idled up Central Avenue on their way across the town to the Yacht Basin and the main harbour and the big hotels, Bond caught a whiff of the atmosphere that makes the town the \u0027Old Folks Home\u0027 of America. Everyone on the sidewalks had white hair, white or blue, and the famous Sidewalk Davenports that Solitaire had described were thick with oldsters sitting in rows like the starlings in Trafalgar Square. \\n\\n Bond noted the small grudging mouths of the women, the sun gleaming on their pince-nez; the stringy, collapsed chests and arms of the men displayed to the sunshine in Truman shirts. The fluffy, sparse balls of hair on the women showing the pink scalp. The bony bald heads of the men. And, everywhere, a prattling camaraderie, a swapping of news and gossip, a making of folksy dates for the shuffle board and the bridge-table, a handing round of letters from children and grandchildren, a tut-tutting about prices in the shops and the motels. \\n\\n You didn\u0027t have to be amongst them to hear it all. It was all in the nodding and twittering of the balls of blue fluff, the back-slapping and hawk-an-spitting of the little old baldheads. \\n\\n \u0027It makes you want to climb right into the tomb and pull the lid down,\u0027 said Leiter at Bond\u0027s exclamations of horror. \u0027You wait till we get out and walk. If they see your shadow coming up the sidewalk behind them they jump out of the way as if you were the Chief Cashier coming to look over their shoulders in the bank. It\u0027s ghastly. Makes me think of the bank clerk who went home unexpectedly at midday and found the President of the bank sleeping with his wife. He went back and told his pals in the ledger department and said, \"Gosh, fellers, he nearly caught me!\" \u0027 \\n\\n Bond laughed. \\n\\n \u0027You can hear all the presentation gold watches ticking in their pockets,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Place is full of undertakers, and pawnshops stuffed with gold watches and masonic rings and bits of jet and lockets full of hair. Makes you shiver to think of it all. Wait till you go to \"Aunt Milly\u0027s Place\" and see them all in droves mumbling over their corn-beef hash and cheeseburgers, trying to keep alive till ninety. It\u0027ll frighten the life out of you. But they\u0027re not all old down here. Take a look at that ad over there.\u0027 He pointed towards a big hoarding on a deserted lot. \\n\\n It was an advertisement for maternity clothes. \u0027STUTZ HEIMER \u0026 BLOCK,\u0027 it Said, \u0027IT\u0027S NEW! OUR ANTICIPATION DEPARTMENT, AND AFTER! CLOTHES FOR CHIPS (1-4) AND TWIGS (4-8).\u0027 \\n\\n Bond groaned. \u0027Let\u0027s get away from here,\u0027 he said. \u0027This is really beyond the call of duty.\u0027 \\n\\n They came down to the waterfront and turned right until they came to the seaplane base and the coastguard station. The streets were free of oldsters and here there was the normal life of a harbour - wharves, warehouses, a ship\u0027s chandler, some up-turned boats, nets drying, the cry of seagulls, the. rather fetid smell coming in off the bay. After the teeming boneyard of the town the sign over the garage: \u0027Drive-ur-Self. Pat Grady. The Smiling Irishman. Used cars,\u0027 was a cheerful reminder of a livelier, bustling world. \\n\\n \u0027Better get out and walk,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027The Robber\u0027s place is in the next block.\u0027 \\n\\n They left the car beside the harbour and sauntered along past a timber warehouse and some oil-storage tanks. Then they turned left again towards the sea. \\n\\n The side-road ended at a small weather-beaten wooden jetty that reached out twenty feet on barnacled piles into the bay. Right up against its open gate was a long low corrugated-iron warehouse. Over its wide double doors was painted, black on white, \u0027Ourobouros Inc. Live Worm and Bait Merchants. Coral, Shells, Tropical Fish. Wholesale only.\u0027 In one of the double doors there was a smaller door with a gleaming Yale lock. On the door was a sign: \u0027Private. Keep Out.\u0027 \\n\\n Against this a man sat on a kitchen chair, its back tilted so that the door supported his weight. He was cleaning a rifle, a Remington 30 it looked like to Bond. He had a wooden toothpick sticking out of his mouth and a battered baseball cap on the back of his head. He was wearing a stained white singlet that revealed tufts of black hair under his arms, and slept-in white canvas trousers and rubber-soled sneakers. He was around forty and his face was as knotted and seamed as the mooring posts on the jetty. It was a thin, hatchet face, and the lips were thin too, and bloodless. His complexion was the colour of tobacco dust, a sort of yellowy-beige. He looked cruel and cold, like the bad man in a film about poker-players and gold mines. \\n\\n Bond and Leiter walked past him and on to the pier. He didn\u0027t look up from his rifle as they went past but Bond sensed that his eyes were following them. \\n\\n \u0027If that isn\u0027t The Robber,\u0027 said Leiter, Ht\u0027s a blood relation.\u0027 \\n\\n A pelican, grey with a pale yellow head, was hunched on one of the mooring posts at the end of the jetty. He let them get very close, then reluctantly gave a few heavy beats of his wings and planed down towards the water. The two men stood and watched him flying slowly along just above the surface of the harbour. Suddenly he crashed clumsily down, his long bill snaking out and down in front of him. It came up clutching a small fish which he moodily swallowed. Then the heavy bird got up again and went on fishing, flying mostly into the sun so that its big shadow would give no warning. When Bond and Leiter turned to walk back down the jetty it gave up fishing and glided back to its post. It settled with a clatter of wings and resumed its thoughtful consideration of the late afternoon. \\n\\n The man was still bent over his gun, wiping the mechanism with an oily rag. \\n\\n \u0027Good afternoon,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027You the manager of this wharf?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yep,\u0027 said the man without looking up. \\n\\n \u0027Wondered if there was any chance of mooring my boat here. Basin\u0027s pretty crowded.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Nope.\u0027 \\n\\n Leiter took out his notecase. \u0027Would twenty talk?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Nope.\u0027 The man gave a rattling hawk in his throat and spat directly between Bond and Leiter. \\n\\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027You want to watch your manners.\u0027 \\n\\n The man deliberated. He looked up at Leiter. He had small, close-set eyes as cruel as a painless dentist\u0027s. x \u0027What\u0027s a name of your boat?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027The Sybil,\u0027 said Leiter. \\n\\n \u0027Ain\u0027t no sich boat in the Basin,\u0027 said the man. He clicked the breech shut on his rifle. It lay casually on his lap pointing down the approach to the warehouse, away from the sea. \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re blind,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Been there a week. Sixty-foot twin-screw Diesel. White with a green awning. Rigged for fishing.\u0027 \\n\\n The rifle started to move lazilv in a low arc. The man\u0027s left hand was at the trigger, his right just in front of the trigger-guard, pivoting the gun. \\n\\n They stood still. \\n\\n The man sat lazily looking down at the breech, his chair still tilted against the small door with the yellow Yale lock. \\n\\n The gun slowly traversed Leiter\u0027s stomach, then Bond\u0027s. The two men stood like statues, not risking a move of the hand. The gun stopped pivoting. It was pointing down the wharf. The Robber looked briefly up, narrowed his eyes and pulled the trigger. The pelican gave a fault squawk and they heard its heavy body crash into the water. The echo of the shot boomed across the harbour. \\n\\n \u0027What the hell d\u0027you do that for?\u0027 asked Bond furiously. \\n\\n \u0027Practice,\u0027 said the man, pumping another bullet into the breech. \\n\\n \u0027Guess there\u0027s a branch of the ASPCA in this town,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Let\u0027s get along there and report this guy.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Want to be prosecuted for trespass?\u0027 asked The Robber, getting slowly up and shifting the gun under his arm. \u0027This is private property. Now,\u0027 he spat the words out, \u0027git the hell out of here.\u0027 He turned and yanked the chair away from the door, opened the door with a key and turned with one foot on the threshold. \u0027You both got guns,\u0027 he said. \u0027I kin smell \u0027em. You come aroun\u0027 here again and you follow the boid \u0027n I plead self-defence. I\u0027ve had a bellyful of you lousy dicks aroun\u0027 here lately breathin\u0027 down my neck. Sybil my ass!\u0027 He turned contemptuously through the door and slammed it so that the frame rattled. \\n\\n They looked at each other. Leiter grinned ruefully and shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n \u0027Round One to The Robber,\u0027 he said. \\n\\n They moved off down the dusty sideroad. The sun was setting and the sea behind them was a pool of blood. When they got to the main road, Bond looked back. A big arc light had come on over the door and the approach to the warehouse was stripped of shadows. \\n\\n \u0027No good trying anything from the front,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027But there\u0027s never been a warehouse with only one entrance.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Just what I was thinking,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027We\u0027ll save that for the next visit.\u0027 \\n\\n They got into the car and drove slowly home across Central Avenue. \\n\\n On their way home Leiter asked a string of questions about Solitaire. Finally he said casually: \u0027By the way, hope I fixed the rooms like you want them.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t be better,\u0027 said Bond cheerfully. \\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Just occurred to me you two might be hyphenating.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You read too much Winchell,\u0027 said Bond. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just a delicate way of putting it,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Don\u0027t forget the walls of those cottages are pretty thin. I use my ears for hearing with - not for collecting lip-stick.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond grabbed for a handkerchief. \u0027You lousy, goddam sleuth,\u0027 he said furiously. \\n\\n Leiter watched him scrubbing at himself out of the corner of his eye. \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 he asked innocently. \u0027I wasn\u0027t for a moment suggesting the colour of your ears was anything but a natural red. However…\u0027 He put a wealth of meaning into the word. \\n\\n \u0027If you find yourself dead in your bed tonight,\u0027 laughed Bond, \u0027you\u0027ll know who did it.\u0027 \\n\\n They were still chaffing each other when they arrived at The Everglades and they were laughing when the grim Mrs. Stuyvesant greeted them on the lawn. \\n\\n \u0027Pardon me, Mr. Leiter,\u0027 she said. \u0027But I\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t allow music here. I can\u0027t have the other guests disturbed at all hours.\u0027 \\n\\n They looked at her in astonishment. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Mrs. Stuyvesant,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027I don\u0027t quite get you.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027That big radiogram you had sent round,\u0027 said Mrs. Stuyvesant. \u0027The men could hardly get the packing-case through the door.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565/46412.html","bookId":1275,"book":{"id":1275,"title":"007之生死关头 Live And Let Die","description":"简介： 讲述了007詹姆斯邦德奉命调查三名英国情报人员在美国遇害事件，而邦德必须对抗走私海洛因的Mr. Big和他的巫毒教信徒的故事。007接到一单新任务，英国三名情报人员在美国遇害，英政府却无法查出凶手，007赶赴异邦调查真相，意外发现这宗案件不仅与邪恶的巫术有关，还牵涉...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/25/14-08-39-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
