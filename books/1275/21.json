Here a single negro with an acetylene light beside him was fitting trays full of gold coin into the centre of the fish-tanks, scores of which were stacked against the wall. \n As they waited, two negroes came down the steps from the surface, picked up one of the prepared tanks and went back up the steps with it. \n Bond guessed the tanks were stocked with sand and weed and fish somewhere up above and then passed to the human chain that stretched down the cliff face. \n Bond noticed that some of the waiting tanks had gold ingots fitted in the centre, and others a gravel of jewels, and he revised his estimate of the treasure, quadrupling it to around four million sterling. \n Mr. Big stood for a few moments with his eyes on the stone floor. His breathing was deep but controlled. Then they went on up. \n Twenty steps higher there was another landing, smaller and with a door leading off it. The door had a new chain and padlock on it. The door itself was made of platted iron slats, brown and corroded with rust. \n Mr. Big paused again and they stood side by side on the small platform of rock. \n For a moment Bond thought of escape, but, as if reading his mind, the negro guard crowded him up against the stone wall away from The Big Man. And Bond knew his first duty was to stay alive and get to Solitaire and somehow keep her away from the doomed ship where the acid was slowly eating through the copper of the timefuse. \n From above, a strong draught of cold air was coming down the shaft and Bond felt the sweat drying on him. He put his right hand up to the wound in his shoulder, undeterred by the prick of the guard\u0027s dagger in his side. The blood was dry and caked and most of the arm was numb. It ached viciously. \n Mr. Big spoke. \n \u0027That wind, Mister Bond,\u0027 he pointed up the shaft, \u0027is known in Jamaica as \"The Undertaker\u0027s Wind\".\u0027 \n Bond shrugged his right shoulder and saved his breath. \n Mr. Big turned to the iron door, took a key from his pocket and unlocked it. He went through and Bond and his guard followed. \n It was a long, narrow passage of a room with rusty shackles low down in the walls at less than yard intervals. \n At the far end, where a hurricane light hung from the stone roof, there was a motionless figure under a blanket on the floor. There was one more hurricane light over their heads near the door, otherwise nothing but a smell of damp rock, and ancient torture, and death. \n \u0027Solitaire,\u0027 said Mr. Big softly. \n Bond\u0027s heart leapt and he started forward. At once a huge hand grasped him by the arm. \n \u0027Hold it, white man,\u0027 snapped his guard and twisted his wrist up between his shoulder-blades, hefting it higher until \n Bond lashed out with his left heel. It hit the other man\u0027s shin, and hurt Bond more than the guard. \n Mr. Big turned round. He had a small gun almost covered by his huge hand. \n \u0027Let him go,\u0027 he said, quietly. \u0027If you want an extra navel, Mister Bond, you can have one. I have six of them in this gun.\u0027 \n Bond brushed past The Big Man. Solitaire was on her feet, coming towards him. When she saw his face she broke into a run, holding out her two hands. \n \u0027James,\u0027 she sobbed. \u0027James.\u0027 \n She almost fell at his feet. Their hands clutched at each other. \n \u0027Get me some rope,\u0027 said Mr. Big in the doorway. \n \u0027It\u0027s all right, Solitaire,\u0027 said Bond, knowing that it wasn\u0027t. \u0027It\u0027s all right. I\u0027m here now.\u0027 \n He picked her up and held her at arm\u0027s length. It hurt his left arm. She was pale and dishevelled. There was a bruise on her forehead and black circles under her eyes. Her face was grimy and tears had made streaks down the pale skin. She had no make-up. She wore a dirty white linen suit and sandals. She looked thin. \n \u0027What\u0027s the bastard been doing to you?\u0027 said Bond. He suddenly held her tightly to him. She clung to him, her face buried in his neck. \n Then she drew away and looked at her hand. \n \u0027But you\u0027re bleeding,\u0027 she said. \u0027What is it?\u0027 \n She turned him half round and saw the black blood on his shoulder and down his arm. \n \u0027Oh my darling, what is it?\u0027 \n She started to cry again, forlornly, hopelessly, realizing suddenly that they were both lost. \n \u0027Tie them up,\u0027 said The Big Man from the door. \u0027Here under the light. I have things to say to them.\u0027 \n The negro came towards them and Bond turned. Was it worth a gamble? The negro had nothing but rope in his hands. But The Big Man had stepped sideways and was watching him, the gun held loosely, half pointing at the floor. \n \u0027No, Mister Bond,\u0027 he said simply. \n Bond eyed the big negro and thought of Solitaire and his own wounded arm. \n The negro came up and Bond allowed his arms to be tied behind his back. They were good knots. There was no play in them. They hurt. \n Bond smiled at Solitaire. He half closed one eye. It was nothing but bravado, but he saw a hopeful awareness dawn through her tears. \n The negro led him back to the doorway. \n \u0027There,\u0027 said The Big Man, pointing at one of the shackles. \n The negro cut Bond\u0027s legs from under him with a sudden sweep of his shin. Bond fell on his wounded shoulder. The negro pulled him by the rope up to the shackle, tested it, and put the rope through and then down to Bond\u0027s ankles which he bound securely. He had stuck his dagger in a crevice in the rock. He pulled it out and cut the rope and went back to where Solitaire was standing. \n Bond was left sitting on the stone floor, his legs straight out in front, his arms hoisted up and secured behind him. Blood dripped down from his freshly opened wound. Only the remains of the benzedrine in his system kept him from fainting. \n Solitaire was bound and placed almost opposite him. There was a yard between their feet. \n When it was done, The Big Man looked at his watch. \n \u0027Go,\u0027 he said to the guard. He closed the iron door behind the man and leant against it. \n Bond and the girl looked at each other and The Big Man gazed down on both of them. \n After one of his long silences he addressed Bond. Bond looked up at him. The great grey football of a head under the hurricane lamp looked like an elemental, a malignant spectre from the centre of the earth, as it hung in mid air, the golden eyes blazing steadily, the great body in shadow. Bond had to remind himself that he had heard its heart pumping in its chest, had heard it breathe, had seen sweat on the grey skin. It was only a man, of the same species as himself, a big man, with a brilliant brain, but still a man who walked and defecated, a mortal man with a diseased heart. \n The wide rubbery mouth split open and the flat slightly everted lips drew back from the big white teeth. \n \u0027You are the best of those that have been sent against me,\u0027 said Mr. Big. His quiet flat voice was thoughtful, measured. \u0027And you have achieved the death of four of my assistants. My followers find this incredible. It was fully time that accounts should be squared. What happened to the American was not sufficient. The treachery of this girl,\u0027 he still looked at Bond, \u0027whom I found in the gutter and whom I was prepared to put on my right hand, has also brought my infallibility in question. I was wondering how she should die, when providence, or Baron Samedi as my followers will believe, brought you also to the altar with your head bowed ready for the axe.\u0027 \n The mouth paused, with the lips parted. Bond saw the teeth come together to form the next word. \n \u0027So it is convenient that you should die together. That will happen, in an appropriate fashion,\u0027 The Big Man looked at his watch, \u0027in two and a half hours\u0027 time. At six o\u0027clock, give or take,\u0027 he added, \u0027a few minutes.\u0027 \n \u0027Let\u0027s give those minutes,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I enjoy my life.\u0027 \n \u0027In the history of negro emancipation,\u0027 Mr. Big continued in an easy conversational tone,\u0027 there have already appeared great athletes, great musicians, great writers, great doctors and scientists. In due course, as in the developing history of other races, there will appear negroes great and famous in every other walk of life.\u0027 He paused. \u0027It is unfortunate for you, Mister Bond, and for this girl, that you have encountered the first of the great negro criminals. I use a vulgar word, Mister Bond, because it is the one you, as a form of policeman, would yourself use. But I prefer to regard myself as one who has the ability and the mental and nervous equipment to make his own laws and act according to them rather than accept the laws that suit the lowest common denominator of the people. You have doubtless read Trotter\u0027s Instincts of the Herd in War and Peace, Mister Bond. Well, I am by nature and predilection a wolf and I live by a wolf\u0027s laws. Naturally the sheep describe such a person as a \"criminal\". \n \u0027The fact, Mister Bond,\u0027 The Big Man continued after a pause,\u0027 that I survive and indeed enjoy limitless success, although I am alone against countless millions of sheep, is attributable to the modern techniques I described to you on the occasion of our last talk, and to an infinite capacity for taking pains. Not dull, plodding pains, but artistic, subtle pains. And I find, Mister Bond, that it is not difficult to outwit sheep, however many of them there may be, if one is dedicated to the task and if one is by nature an extremely well-equipped wolf. \n \u0027Let me illustrate to you, by an example, how my mind works. We will take the method I have decided upon by which you are both to die. It is a modern variation on the method used in the time of my kind patron, Sir Henry Morgan. In those days it was known as \"keel-hauling\".\u0027 \n \u0027Pray continue,\u0027 said Bond, not looking at Solitaire. \n \u0027We have a paravane on board the yacht,\u0027 continued Mr. Big as if he was a surgeon describing a delicate operation to a body of students, \u0027which we use for trawling for shark and other big fish. This paravane, as you know, is a large buoyant torpedo-shaped device, which rides on the end of a cable, away from the side of a ship, and which can be used for sustaining the end of a net, and drawing it through the water when the ship is in motion, or if fitted with a cutting device, for severing the cables of moored mines in time of war. \n \u0027I intend,\u0027 said Mr. Big, in a matter-of-fact discursive tone of voice,\u0027 to bind you together to a line streamed from this paravane and to tow you through the sea until you are eaten by sharks.\u0027 \n He paused, and his eyes looked from one to the other. Solitaire was gazing wide-eyed at Bond and Bond was thinking hard, his eyes blank and his mind boring into the future. He felt he ought to say something. \n \u0027You are a big man,\u0027 he said, \u0027and one day you will die a big, horrible death. If you kill us, that death will come soon. I have arranged for it. You are going mad very fast or you would see what our murder will bring down on you.\u0027 \n Even as he spoke Bond\u0027s mind was working fast, counting hours and minutes, knowing that The Big Man\u0027s own death was creeping, with the acid in the fuse, round the minute hand towards his personal hour of final rendezvous. But would he and Solitaire be dead before that hour struck? There would not be more than minutes, perhaps seconds in it. The sweat poured off his face on to his chest. He smiled across at Solitaire. She looked back at him opaquely, her eyes not seeing him. \n Suddenly she gave an agonized cry that made Bond\u0027s nerves jerk. \n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she cried. \u0027I can\u0027t see. It\u0027s so near, so close. There is much death. But…\u0027 \n \u0027Solitaire,\u0027 shouted Bond, terrified that whatever strange things she saw in the future might give a warning to The Big Man. \u0027Pull yourself together.\u0027 \n There was an angry bite in his voice. \n Her eyes cleared. She looked dumbly at him, without comprehension. \n The Big Man spoke again. \n \u0027I am not going mad, Mister Bond,\u0027 he said evenly, \u0027and nothing you have arranged will affect me. You will die beyond the reef and there will be no evidence. I shall tow the remains of your bodies until there is nothing left. That is part of the dexterity of my intentions. You may also know that shark and barracuda play a role in Voodooism. They will have their sacrifice and Baron Samedi will be appeased. That will satisfy my followers. I wish also to continue my experiments with carnivorous fish. I believe they only attack when there is blood in the water. So your bodies will be towed from the island. The paravane will take them over the reef. I believe you will not be harmed inside the reef. The blood and offal that is thrown into these waters every night will have dispersed or been consumed. But when your bodies have been dragged over the reef, then I\u0027m afraid you will bleed, your bodies will be very raw. And then we will see if my theories are correct.\u0027 \n The Big Man put his hand behind him and pulled the door open. \n \u0027I will leave you now,\u0027 he said,\u0027 to reflect on the excellence of the method I have invented for your death together. Two necessary deaths are achieved. No evidence is left behind. Superstition is satisfied. My followers pleased. The bodies are used for scientific research. \n \u0027That is what I meant, Mister James Bond, by an infinite capacity for taking artistic pains.\u0027 \n He stood in the doorway and looked at them. \n \u0027A short, but very good night to you both.\u0027 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565/46420.html","bookId":1275,"book":{"id":1275,"title":"007之生死关头 Live And Let Die","description":"简介： 讲述了007詹姆斯邦德奉命调查三名英国情报人员在美国遇害事件，而邦德必须对抗走私海洛因的Mr. Big和他的巫毒教信徒的故事。007接到一单新任务，英国三名情报人员在美国遇害，英政府却无法查出凶手，007赶赴异邦调查真相，意外发现这宗案件不仅与邪恶的巫术有关，还牵涉...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/25/14-08-39-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1565","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
