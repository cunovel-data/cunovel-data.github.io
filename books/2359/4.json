{"id":68075,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The news of Tracy Whitney\u0027s crime and sentencing appeared on the front page of the New Orleans Courier, accompanied by a police photograph of her. The major wire services picked up the story and flashed it to correspondent newspapers around the country, and when Tracy was taken from the courtroom to await transfer to the state penitentiary, she was confronted by a crew of television reporters. She hid her face in humiliation, but there was no escape from the cameras. Joe Romano was big news, and the attempt on his life by a beautiful female burglar was even bigger news. It seemed to Tracy that she was surrounded by enemies. Charles will get me out, she kept repeating to herself. Oh, please, God, let Charles get me out. I can\u0027t have our baby born in prison.\n It was not until the following afternoon that the desk sergeant would permit Tracy to use the telephone. Harriet answered. \"Mr. Stanhope\u0027s office.\"\n \"Harriet, this is Tracy Whitney. I\u0027d like to speak to Mr. Stanhope.\"\n \"Just a moment, Miss Whitney.\" She heard the hesitation in the secretary\u0027s voice. \"I\u0027ll - I\u0027ll see if Mr. Stanhope is in.\"\n After a long, harrowing wait, Tracy finally heard Charles\u0027s voice. She could have wept with relief. \"Charles - \"\n \"Tracy? Is that you, Tracy?\"\n \"Yes, darling. Oh, Charles, I\u0027ve been trying to reach - \"\n \"I\u0027ve been going crazy, Tracy! The newspapers here are full of wild stories about you. I can\u0027t believe what they\u0027re saying.\"\n \"None of it is true, darling. None of it. I - \"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you call me?\"\n \"I tried. I couldn\u0027t reach you. I - \"\n \"Where are you now?\"\n \"I\u0027m - I\u0027m in a jail in New Orleans. Charles, they\u0027re going to send me to prison for something I didn\u0027t do.\" To her horror, she was weeping.\n \"Hold on. Listen to me. The papers say that you shot a man. That\u0027s not true, is it?\"\n \"I did shoot him, but - \"\n \"Then it is true.\"\n \"It\u0027s not the way it sounds, darling. It\u0027s not like that at all. I can explain everything to you. I - \"\n \"Tracy, did you plead guilty to attempted murder and stealing a painting?\"\n \"Yes, Charles, but only because - \"\n \"My God, if you needed money that badly, you should have discussed it with me.... And trying to kill someone.... I can\u0027t believe this. Neither can my parents. You\u0027re the headline in this morning\u0027s Philadelphia Daily News. This is the first time a breath of scandal has ever touched the Stanhope family.\"\n It was the bitter self-control of Charles\u0027s voice that made Tracy aware of the depth of his feelings. She had counted on him so desperately, and he was on their side. She forced herself not to scream. \"Darling, I need you. Please come down here. You can straighten all this out.\"\n There was a long silence. \"It doesn\u0027t sound like there\u0027s much to straighten out. Not if you\u0027ve confessed to doing all those things. The family can\u0027t afford to get mixed up in a thing like this. Surely you can see that. This has been a terrible shock for us. Obviously, I never really knew you.\"\n Each word was a hammerblow. The world was falling in on her. She felt more alone than she had ever felt in her life. There was no one to turn to now, no one. \"What - what about the baby?\"\n \"You\u0027ll have to do whatever you think best with your baby,\" Charles said. \"I\u0027m sorry, Tracy.\" And the connection was broken.\n She stood there holding the dead receiver in her hand.\n A prisoner behind her said, \"if you\u0027re through with the phone, honey, I\u0027d like to call my lawyer.\"\n When Tracy was returned to her cell, the matron had instructions for her. \"Be ready to leave in the morning. You\u0027ll be picked up at five o\u0027clock.\"\n She had a visitor. Otto Schmidt seemed to have aged years during the few hours since Tracy had last seen him. He looked ill.\n \"I just came to tell you how sorry my wife and I are. We know whatever happened wasn\u0027t your fault.\"\n If only Charles had said that!\n \"The wife and I will be at Mrs. Doris\u0027s funeral tomorrow.\"\n \"Thank you, Otto.\"\n They\u0027re going to bury both of us tomorrow, Tracy thought miserably.\n She spent the night wide awake, lying on her narrow prison bunk, staring at the ceiling. In her mind she replayed the conversation with Charles again and again. He had never even given her a chance to explain.\n She had to think of the baby. She had read of women having babies in prison, but the stories had been so remote from her own life that it was as though she were reading about people from another planet. Now it was happening to her. You\u0027ll have to do whatever you think best with your baby, Charles had said. She wanted to have her baby. And yet, she thought, they won\u0027t let me keep it. They\u0027ll take it away from me because I\u0027m going to be in prison for the next fifteen years. It\u0027s better that it never knows about its mother.\n She wept.\n At 5:00 in the morning a male guard, accompanied by a matron, entered Tracy\u0027s cell. \"Tracy Whitney?\"\n \"Yes.\" She was surprised at how odd her voice sounded.\n \"By order of the Criminal Court of the State of Louisiana, Orleans Parish, you are forthwith being transferred to the Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women. Let\u0027s move it, babe.\"\n She was walked down a long corridor, past cells filled with inmates. There was a series of catcalls.\n \"Have a good trip, honey....\"\n \"You tell me where you got that paintin\u0027 hidden, Tracy, baby, and I\u0027ll split the money with you...\"\n \"If you\u0027re headin\u0027 for the big house, ask for Ernestine Littlechap. She\u0027ll take real good care of you....\"\n Tracy passed the telephone where she had made her call to Charles. Good-bye, Charles.\n She was outside in a courtyard. A yellow prison bus with barred windows stood there, its engine idling. Half a dozen women already were seated in the bus, watched over by two armed guards. Tracy looked at the faces of her fellow passengers. One was defiant, and another bored; others wore expressions of despair. The lives they had lived were about to come to an end. They were outcasts, headed for cages where they would be locked up like animals. Tracy wondered what crimes they had committed and whether any of them was as innocent as she was, and she wondered what they saw in her face.\n The ride on the prison bus was interminable, the bus hot and smelly, but Tracy was unaware of it. She had withdrawn into herself, no longer conscious of the other passengers or of the lush green countryside the bus passed through. She was in another time, in another place.\n She was a little girl at the shore with her mother and father, and her father was carrying her into the ocean on his shoulders, and when she cried out her father said, Don\u0027t be a baby, Tracy, and he dropped her into the cold water. When the water closed over her head, she panicked and began to choke, and her father lifted her up and did it again, and from that moment on she had been terrified of the water....\n The college auditorium was filled with students and their parents and relatives. She was class valedictorian. She spoke for fifteen minutes, and her speech was filled with soaring idealism, clever references to the past, and shining dreams for the future. The dean had presented her with a Phi Beta Kappa key. l want you to keep it, Tracy told her mother, and the pride on her mother\u0027s face was beautiful....\n I\u0027m going to Philadelphia, Mother. I have a job at a bank there.\n Annie Mahler, her best friend, was calling her. You\u0027ll love Philadelphia, Tracy. It\u0027s full of all kinds of cultural things. It has beautiful scenery and a shortage of women. I mean, the men here are really hungry! I can get you a job at the bank where I work....\n Charles was making love to her. She watched the moving shadows on the ceiling and thought, How many girls would like to be in my place? Charles was a prime catch. And she was instantly ashamed of the thought. She loved him. She could feel him inside her, beginning to thrust harder, faster and faster, on the verge of exploding, and he gasped out, Are you ready? And she lied and said yes. Was it wonderful for you? Yes, Charles. And she thought, Is that all there is? And the guilt again....\n \"You! I\u0027m talkin\u0027 to you. Are you deaf for Christ\u0027s sake? Let\u0027s go.\"\n Tracy looked up and she was in the yellow prison bus. It had stopped in an enclosure surrounded by a gloomy pile of masonry. A series of nine fences topped with barbed wire surrounded the five hundred acres of farm pasture and woodlands that made up the prison grounds of the Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women.\n \"Get out,\" the guard said. \"We\u0027re here.\"\n Here was hell. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-tomorrow-comes/page-4.html","bookId":2359,"book":{"id":2359,"title":"If Tomorrow Comes","description":"Storyline: \n This is a story of intrigue and revenge.
