{"id":68104,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"Early the following morning Daniel Cooper, Inspector Joop van Duren, and his young assistant, Detective Constable Witkamp, were in the upstairs suite listening to the conversation below.\n \"More coffee?\" Jeff\u0027s voice.\n \"No, thank you, darling.\" Tracy\u0027s voice. \"Try this cheese that room service sent up. It\u0027s really wonderful.\"\n A short silence. \"Mmmm. Delicious. What would you like to do today, Tracy? We could take a drive to Rotterdam.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t we just stay in and relax?\"\n \"Sounds good.\"\n Daniel Cooper knew what they meant by \"relax,\" and his mouth tightened.\n \"The queen is dedicating a new home for orphans.\"\n \"Nice. I think the Dutch are the most hospitable, generous people in the world. They\u0027re iconoclasts. They hate rules and regulations.\"\n A laugh. \"Of course. That\u0027s why we both like them so much.\"\n Ordinary morning conversation between lovers. They\u0027re so free and easy with each other, Cooper thought. But how she would pay!\n \"Speaking of generous\" - Jeff\u0027s voice - \"guess who\u0027s staying at this hotel? The elusive Maximilian Pierpont. I missed him on the QE Two.\"\n \"And I missed him on the Orient Express.\"\n \"He\u0027s probably here to rape another company. Now that we\u0027ve found him again, Tracy, we really should do something about him. I mean, as long as he\u0027s in the neighborhood...\"\n Tracy\u0027s laughter. \"I couldn\u0027t agree more, darling.\"\n \"I understand our friend is in the habit of carrying priceless artifacts with him. I have an idea that - \"\n Another voice, female. \"Dag, mijnheer, dag, mevrouw. Would you care for your room to be made up now?\"\n Van Duren turned to Detective Constable Witkamp. \"I want a surveillance team on Maximilian Pierpont. The moment Whitney or Stevens makes any kind of contact with him, I want to know it.\"\n Inspector van Duren was reporting to Chief Commissioner Toon Willems.\n \"They could be after any number of targets, Chief Commissioner. They\u0027re showing a great deal of interest in a wealthy American here named Maximilian Pierpont, they attended the philatelist convention, they visited the Lucullan diamond at the Nederlands Diamond-Cutting Factory, and spent two hours at The Night Watch - \"\n \"Een diefstal van de Nachtwacht? Nee! Impossible!\"\n The chief commissioner sat back in his chair and wondered whether he was recklessly wasting valuable time and manpower. There was too much speculation and not enough facts. \"So at the moment you have no idea what their target is.\"\n \"No, Chief Commissioner. I\u0027m not certain they themselves have decided. But the moment they do, they will inform us.\"\n Willems frowned. \"Inform you?\"\n \"The bugs,\" Van Duren explained. \"They have no idea they are being bugged.\"\n The breakthrough for the police came at 9:00 A.M. the following morning. Tracy and Jeff were finishing breakfast in Tracy\u0027s suite. At the listening post upstairs were Daniel Cooper, Inspector Joop van Duren, and Detective Constable Witkamp. They heard the sound of coffee being poured.\n \"Here\u0027s an interesting item, Tracy. Our friend was right. Listen to this: \u0027Amro Bank is shipping five million dollars in gold bullion to the Dutch West Indies.\u0027 \"\n In the suite on the floor above, Detective Constable Witkamp said, \"There\u0027s no way - \"\n \"Shh!\"\n They listened.\n \"I wonder how much five million dollars in gold would weigh?\" Tracy\u0027s voice.\n \"I can tell you exactly, my darling. One thousand six hundred seventy-two pounds, about sixty-seven gold bars. The wonderful thing about gold is that it\u0027s so beautifully anonymous. You melt it down and it could belong to anybody. Of course, it wouldn\u0027t be easy to get those bars out of Holland.\"\n \"Even if we could, how would we get hold of them in the first place? Just walk into the bank and pick them up?\"\n \"Something like that.\"\n \"You\u0027re joking.\"\n \"I never joke about that kind of money. Why don\u0027t we just stroll by the Amro Bank, Tracy, and have a little look?\"\n \"What do you have in mind?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you all about it on the way.\"\n There was the sound of a door closing, and the voices ended.\n Inspector van Duren was fiercely twisting his mustache. \"Nee! There is no way they could get their hands on that gold. I, myself, approved those security arrangements.\"\n Daniel Cooper announced flatly, \"If there\u0027s a flaw in the bank\u0027s security system, Tracy Whitney will find it.\"\n It was all Inspector van Duren could do to control his hair-trigger temper. The odd-looking American had been an abomination ever since his arrival. It was his God-given sense of superiority that was so difficult to tolerate. But Inspector van Duren was a policeman first and last; and he had been ordered to cooperate with the weird little man.\n The inspector turned to Witkamp. \"I want you to increase the surveillance unit. Immediately. I want every contact photographed and questioned. Clear?\"\n \"Yes, Inspector.\"\n \"And very discreetly, mind you. They must not know they are being watched.\"\n \"Yes, Inspector.\"\n Van Duren looked at Cooper. \"There. Does that make you feel better?\"\n Cooper did not bother to reply.\n During the next five days Tracy and Jeff kept Inspector van Duren\u0027s men busy, and Daniel Cooper carefully examined all the daily reports. At night, when the other detectives left the listening post, Cooper lingered. He listened for the sounds of lovemaking that he knew was going on below. He could hear nothing, but in his mind Tracy was moaning, \"Oh, yes, darling, yes, yes. Oh, God, I can\u0027t stand it... it\u0027s so wonderful.... Now, oh, now..\"\n Then the long, shuddering sigh and the soft, velvety silence. And it was all for him.\n Soon you\u0027ll belong to me, Cooper thought. No one else will have you.\n During the day, Tracy and Jeff went their separate ways, and wherever they went they were followed. Jeff visited a printing shop near Leidseplein, and two detectives watched from the street as he held an earnest conversation with the printer. When Jeff left, one of the detectives followed him. The other went into the shop and showed the printer his plastic-coated police identity card with the official stamp, photograph, and the diagonal red, white, and blue stripes.\n \"The man who just left here. What did he want?\"\n \"He\u0027s run out of business cards. He wants me to print some more for him.\"\n \"Let me see.\"\n The printer showed him a handwritten form:\n Amsterdam Security Services\n Cornelius Wilson, Chief Investigator\n The following day Constable First-Class Fien Hauer waited outside a pet shop on Leidseplein as Tracy went in. When she emerged fifteen minutes later, Fien Hauer entered the shop and showed her identification.\n \"That lady who just left, what did she want?\"\n \"She purchased a bowl of goldfish, two lovebirds, a canary, and a pigeon.\"\n A strange combination. \"A pigeon, you said? You mean an ordinary pigeon?\"\n \"Yes, but no pet store stocks them. I told her we would have to locate one for her.\"\n \"Where are you sending these pets?\"\n \"To her hotel, the Amstel.\"\n On the other side of town, Jeff was speaking to the vice-president of the Amro Bank. They were closeted together for thirty minutes, and when Jeff left the bank, a detective went into the manager\u0027s office.\n \"The man who just walked out. Please tell me why he was here.\"\n \"Mr. Wilson? He\u0027s chief investigator for the security company our bank uses. They\u0027re revising the security system.\"\n \"Did he ask you to discuss the present security arrangements with him?\"\n \"Why, yes, as a matter of fact, he did.\"\n \"And you told him?\"\n \"Of course. But naturally I first took the precaution of telephoning to make sure his credentials were in order.\"\n \"Whom did you telephone?\"\n \"The security service - the number was printed on his identification card.\"\n At 3:00 that afternoon an armored truck pulled up outside the Amro Bank. From across the street, Jeff snapped a picture of the truck, while in a doorway a few yards away a detective photographed Jeff.\n At police headquarters at Elandsgracht Inspector van Duren was spreading out the rapidly accumulating evidence on the desk of Chief Commissioner Toon Willems.\n \"What does all this signify?\" the chief commissioner asked in his dry, thin voice.\n Daniel Cooper spoke. \"I\u0027ll tell you what she\u0027s planning.\" His voice was heavy with conviction. \"She\u0027s planning to hijack the gold shipment.\"\n They were all staring at him.\n Commissioner Willems said, \"And I suppose you know how she intends to accomplish this miracle?\"\n \"Yes.\" He knew something they did not know. He knew Tracy Whitney\u0027s heart and soul and mind. He had put himself inside her, so that he could think like her, plan like her... and anticipate her every move.\n \"By using a fake security truck and getting to the bank before the real truck, and driving off with the bullion.\"\n \"That sounds rather farfetched, Mr. Cooper.\"\n Inspector van Duren broke in. \"I don\u0027t know what their scheme is, but they are planning something, Chief Commissioner. We have their voices on tape.\"\n Daniel Cooper remembered the other sounds he had imagined: the night whispers, the cries and moans. She was behaving like a bitch in heat. Well, where he would put her, no man would ever touch her again.\n The inspector was saying, \"They learned the security routine of the bank. They know what time the armored truck makes its pickup and - \"\n The chief commissioner was studying the report in front of him. \"Lovebirds, a pigeon, goldfish, a canary - do you think any of this nonsense has something to do with the robbery?\"\n \"No,\" Van Duren said.\n \"Yes,\" Cooper said.\n Constable First-Class Fien Hauer, dressed in an aqua polyester slack suit, trailed Tracy Whitney down Prinsengracht, across the Magere Bridge, and when Tracy reached the other side of the canal, Fien Hauer looked on in frustration as Tracy stepped into a public telephone booth and spoke into the phone for five minutes. The constable would have been just as unenlightened if she could have heard the conversation.\n Gunther Hartog, in London, was saying, \"We can depend on Margo, but she\u0027ll need time - at least two more weeks.\" He listened a moment. \"I understand. When everything is ready, I will get in touch with you. Be careful. And give my regards to Jeff.\"\n Tracy replaced the receiver and stepped out of the booth. She gave a friendly nod to the woman in the aqua pantsuit who stood waiting to use the telephone.\n At 11:00 the following morning a detective reported to Inspector van Duren, \"I\u0027m at the Wolters Truck Rental Company, Inspector. Jeff Stevens has just rented a truck from them.\"\n \"What kind of truck?\"\n \"A service truck, Inspector.\"\n \"Get the dimensions. I\u0027ll hold on.\"\n A few minutes later the detective was back on the phone. \"I have them. The truck is - \"\n Inspector van Duren said, \"A step van, twenty feet long, seven feet wide, six feet high, dual axles.\"\n There was an astonished pause. \"Yes, Inspector. How did you know?\"\n \"Never mind. What color is it?\"\n \"Blue.\"\n \"Who\u0027s following Stevens?\"\n \"Jacobs.\"\n \"Goed. Report back here.\"\n Joop van Duren replaced the receiver. He looked up at Daniel Cooper. \"You were right. Except that the van is blue.\"\n \"He\u0027ll take it to an auto paint shop.\"\n The paint shop was located in a garage on the Damrak. Two men sprayed the truck a gun-metal gray, while Jeff stood by. On the roof of the garage a detective shot photographs through the skylight.\n The pictures were on Inspector van Duren\u0027s desk one hour later.\n He shoved them toward Daniel Cooper. \"It\u0027s being painted the identical color of the real security truck. We could pick them up now, you know.\"\n \"On what charges? Having some false business cards printed and painting a truck? The only way to make the charges stick is to catch them when they pick up the bullion.\"\n The little prick acts like he\u0027s running the department. \"What do you think he\u0027ll do next?\"\n Cooper was carefully studying the photograph. \"This truck won\u0027t take the weight of the gold. They\u0027ll have to reinforce the floorboards.\"\n It was a small, out-of-the-way garage on Muider Straat.\n \"Goede morgen, mijnheer. How may I serve you?\"\n \"I\u0027m going to be carrying some scrap iron in this truck,\" Jeff explained, \"and I\u0027m not sure the floorboards are strong enough to take the weight. I\u0027d like them reinforced with metal braces. Can you do that?\"\n The mechanic walked over to the truck and examined it. \"Ja. No problem.\"\n \"Good.\"\n \"I can have it ready vrijdag - Friday.\"\n \"I was hoping to have it tomorrow.\"\n \"Morgen? Nee. Ik - \"\n \"I\u0027ll pay you double.\"\n \"Donderdag - Thursday.\"\n \"Tomorrow. I\u0027ll pay you triple.\"\n The mechanic scratched his chin thoughtfully. \"What time tomorrow?\"\n \"Noon.\"\n \"Ja. Okay.\"\n \"Dank je wel.\"\n \"Tot uw dienst.\"\n Moments after Jeff left the garage a detective was interrogating the mechanic.\n On the same morning the team of surveillance experts assigned to Tracy followed her to the Oude Schans Canal, where she spent half an hour in conversation with the owner of a barge. When Tracy left, one of the detectives stepped aboard the barge. He identified himself to the owner, who was sipping a large bessenjenever, the potent red-currant gin. \"What did the young lady want?\"\n \"She and her husband are going to take a tour of the canals. She\u0027s rented my barge for a week.\"\n \"Beginning when?\"\n \"Friday. It\u0027s a beautiful vacation, mijnheer. If you and your wife would be interested in - \"\n The detective was gone.\n The pigeon Tracy had ordered from the pet shop was delivered to her hotel in a birdcage. Daniel Cooper returned to the pet shop and questioned the owner.\n \"What kind of pigeon did you send her?\"\n \"Oh, you know, an ordinary pigeon.\"\n \"Are you sure it\u0027s not a homing pigeon?\"\n \"No.\" The man giggled. \"The reason I know it\u0027s not a homing pigeon is because I caught it last night in Vondelpark.\"\n A thousand pounds of gold and an ordinary pigeon? Why? Daniel Cooper wondered.\n Five days before the transfer of bullion from the Amro Bank was to take place, a large pile of photographs had accumulated on Inspector Joop van Duren\u0027s desk.\n Each picture is a link in the chain that is going to trap her, Daniel Cooper thought. The Amsterdam police had no imagination. but Cooper had to give them credit for being thorough. Every step leading to the forthcoming crime was photographed and documented. There was no way Tracy Whitney could escape justice.\n Her punishment will be my redemption.\n On the day Jeff picked up the newly painted truck he drove it to a small garage he had rented near the Oude Zijds Kolk, the oldest part of Amsterdam. Six empty wooden boxes stamped MACHINERY were also delivered to the garage.\n A photograph of the boxes lay on Inspector van Duren\u0027s desk as he listened to the latest tape.\n Jeff\u0027s voice: \"When you drive the truck from the bank to the barge, stay within the speed limit. I want to know exactly how long the trip takes. Here\u0027s a stopwatch.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you coming with me, darling?\"\n \"No. I\u0027m going to be busy.\"\n \"What about Monty?\"\n \"He\u0027ll arrive Thursday night.\"\n \"Who is this Monty?\" Inspector van Duren asked.\n \"He\u0027s probably the man who\u0027s going to pose as the second security guard,\" Cooper said. \"They\u0027re going to need uniforms.\"\n The costume store was on Pieter Cornelisz Hooft Straat, in a shopping center.\n \"I need two uniforms for a costume party,\" Jeff explained to the clerk. \"Similar to the one you have in the window.\"\n One hour later Inspector van Duren was looking at a photograph of a guard\u0027s uniform.\n \"He ordered two of these. He told the clerk he would pick them up Thursday.\"\n The size of the second uniform indicated that it was for a man much larger than Jeff Stevens. The inspector said, \"Our friend Monty would be about six-three and weigh around two hundred twenty pounds. We\u0027ll have Interpol put that through their computers,\" he assured Daniel Cooper, \"and we\u0027ll get an identification on him.\"\n In the private garage Jeff had rented, he was perched on top of the truck, and Tracy was in the driver\u0027s seat.\n \"Are you ready?\" Jeff called. \"Now.\"\n Tracy pressed a button on the dashboard. A large piece of canvas rolled down each side of the truck, spelling out HEINEKEN HOLLAND BEER.\n \"It works!\" Jeff cheered.\n \"Heineken beer? Alstublieft!\" Inspector van Duren looked around at the detectives gathered in his office. A series of blown-up photographs and memos were tacked all around the walls.\n Daniel Cooper sat in the back of the room, silent. As far as Cooper was concerned, this meeting was a waste of time. He had long since anticipated every move Tracy Whitney and her lover would make. They had walked into a trap, and the trap was closing in on them. While the detectives in the office were filled with a growing excitement, Cooper felt an odd sense of anticlimax.\n \"All the pieces have fallen into place,\" Inspector van Duren was saying. \"The suspects know what time the real armored truck is due at the bank. They plan to arrive about half an hour earlier, posing as security guards. By the time the real truck arrives, they\u0027ll be gone.\" Van Duren pointed to the photograph of an armored car. \"They will drive away from the bank looking like this, but a block away, on some side street\" - he indicated the Heineken beer truck photograph - \"the truck will suddenly look like this.\"\n A detective from the back of the room spoke up. \"Do you know how they plan to get the gold out of the country, Inspector?\"\n Van Duren pointed to a picture of Tracy stepping onto the barge. \"First, by barge. Holland is so crisscrossed with canals and waterways that they could lose themselves indefinitely.\" He indicated an aerial photograph of the truck speeding along the edge of the canal. \"They\u0027ve timed the run to see how long if takes to get from the bank to their barge. Plenty of time to load the gold onto the barge and be on their way before anyone suspects anything is wrong.\" Van Duren walked over to the last photograph on the wall, an enlarged picture of a freighter. \"Two days ago Jeff Stevens reserved cargo space on the Oresta, sailing from Rotterdam next week. The cargo was listed as machinery, destination Hong Kong.\"\n He turned to face the men in the room. \"Well, gentlemen, we\u0027re making a slight change in their plans. We\u0027re going to let them remove the gold bullion from the bank and load it into the truck.\" He looked at Daniel Cooper and smiled. \"Red-handed. We\u0027re going to catch these clever people red-handed.\"\n A detective followed Tracy into the American Express office, where she picked up a medium-sized package; she returned immediately to her hotel.\n \"No way of knowing what was in the package,\" Inspector van Duren told Cooper. \"We searched both their suites when they left, and there was nothing new in either of them.\"\n Interpol\u0027s computers were unable to furnish any information on the 220-pound Monty.\n At the Amstel late Thursday evening, Daniel Cooper, Inspector van Duren, and Detective Constable Witkamp were in the room above Tracy\u0027s, listening to the voices from below.\n Jeff\u0027s voice: \"If we get to the bank exactly thirty minutes before the guards are due, that will give us plenty of time to load the gold and move out. By the time the real truck arrives, we\u0027ll be stowing the gold onto the barge.\"\n Tracy\u0027s voice: \"I\u0027ve had the mechanic check the truck and fill it with gas. It\u0027s ready.\"\n Detective Constable Witkamp said, \"One must almost admire them. They don\u0027t leave a thing to chance.\"\n \"They all slip up sooner or later,\" Inspector van Duren said curtly.\n Daniel Cooper was silent, listening.\n \"Tracy, when this is over, how would you like to go on that dig we talked about?\"\n \"Tunisia? Sounds like heaven, darling.\"\n \"Good. I\u0027ll arrange it. From now on we\u0027ll do nothing but relax and enjoy life.\"\n Inspector van Duren murmured, \"I\u0027d say their next twenty years are pretty well taken care of.\" He rose and stretched. \"Well, I think we can go to bed. Everything is set for tomorrow morning, and we can all use a good night\u0027s sleep.\"\n Daniel Cooper was unable to sleep. He visualized Tracy being grabbed and manhandled by the police, and he could see the terror on her face. It excited him. He went into the bathroom and ran a very hot bath. He removed his glasses, took off his pajamas, and lay back in the steaming water. It was almost over, and she would pay, as he had made other whores pay. By this time tomorrow he would be on his way home. No, not home, Daniel Cooper corrected himself. To my apartment. Home was a warm, safe place where his mother loved him more than she loved anyone else in the world.\n \"You\u0027re my little man,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know what I would do without you.\"\n Daniel\u0027s father disappeared when Daniel was four years old, and at first he blamed himself, but his mother explained that it was because of another woman. He hated that other woman, because she made his mother cry. He had never seen her, but he knew she was a whore because he had heard his mother call her that. Later, he was happy that the woman had taken his father away, for now he had his mother all to himself. The Minnesota winters were cold, and Daniel\u0027s mother allowed him to crawl into bed with her and snuggle under the warm blankets.\n \"I\u0027m going to marry you one day,\" Daniel promised, and his mother laughed and stroked his hair.\n Daniel was always at the head of his class in school. He wanted his mother to be proud of him.\n What a brilliant little boy you have, Mrs. Cooper.\n I know. No one is as clever as my little man.\n When Daniel was seven years old, his mother started inviting their neighbor, a huge, hairy man, over to their house for dinner, and Daniel became ill. He was in bed for a week with a dangerously high fever, and his mother promised she would never do that again. I don\u0027t need anyone in the world but you, Daniel.\n No one could have been as happy as Daniel. His mother was the most beautiful woman in the whole world. When she was out of the house, Daniel would go into her bedroom and open the drawers of her dresser. He would take out her lingerie and rub the soft material against his cheek. They smelled oh, so wonderful.\n He lay back in the warm tub in the Amsterdam hotel, his eyes closed, remembering the terrible day of his mother\u0027s murder. It was on his twelfth birthday. He was sent home from school early because he had an earache. He pretended it was worse than it was, because he wanted to be home where his mother would soothe him and put him into her bed and fuss over him. Daniel walked into the house and went to his mother\u0027s bedroom, and she was lying naked in their bed, but she was not alone. She was doing unspeakable things to the man who lived next door. Daniel watched as she began to kiss the matted chest and the bloated stomach, and her kisses trailed downward toward the huge red weapon between the man\u0027s legs. Before she took it into her mouth, Daniel heard his mother moan, \"Oh, I love you!\"\n And that was the most unspeakable thing of all. Daniel ran to his bathroom and vomited all over himself. He carefully undressed and cleaned himself up because his mother had taught him to be neat. His earache was really bad now. He heard voices from the hallway and listened.\n His mother was saying, \"You\u0027d better go now, darling. I\u0027ve got to bathe and get dressed. Daniel will be home from school soon. I\u0027m giving him a birthday party. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow, sweetheart.\"\n There was the noise of the front door closing, and then the sound of running water from his mother\u0027s bathroom. Except that she was no longer his mother She was a whore who did dirty things in bed with men, things she had never done with him.\n He walked into her bathroom, naked, and she was in the tub, her whore\u0027s face smiling. She turned her head and saw him and said, \"Daniel, darling! What are you - ?\"\n He carried a pair of heavy dressmaker\u0027s shears in his hand.\n \"Daniel - \" Her mouth was opened into a pink-lined O, but there was no sound until he made the first stab into the breast of the stranger in the tub. He accompanied her screams with his own. \"Whore! Whore! Whore!\"\n They sang a deadly duet together, until finally there was his voice alone. \"Whore... whore...\"\n He was spattered all over with her blood. He stepped into her shower and scrubbed himself until his skin felt raw.\n That man next door had killed his mother, and that man would have to pay.\n After that, everything seemed to happen with a supernal clarity, in a curious kind of slow motion. Daniel wiped the fingerprints off the shears with a washcloth and threw them into the bathtub. They clanked dully against the enamel. He dressed and telephoned the police. Two police cars arrived, with sirens screaming, and then another car filled with detectives, and they asked Daniel questions, and he told them how he had been sent home from school early and about seeing their next-door neighbor, Fred Zimmer, leaving through the side door. When they questioned the man, he admitted being the lover of Daniel\u0027s mother, but denied killing her. It was Daniel\u0027s testimony in court that convicted Zimmer.\n \"When you arrived home from school, you saw your neighbor, Fred Zimmer, running out the side door?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"Could you see him clearly?\"\n \"Yes, sir. There was blood all over his hands.\"\n \"What did you do then, Daniel?\"\n \"I - I was so scared. I knew something awful had happened to my mother.\"\n \"Then did you go into the house?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"And what happened?\"\n \"I called out, \u0027Mother!\u0027 And she didn\u0027t answer, so I went into her bathroom and - \"\n At this point the young boy broke into hysterical sobs and had to be led from the stand.\n Fred Zimmer was executed thirteen months later.\n In the meantime young Daniel had been sent to live with a distant relative in Texas, Aunt Mattie, whom he had never met. She was a stern woman, a hard-shelled Baptist filled with a vehement righteousness and the conviction that hell\u0027s fire awaited all sinners. It was a house without love or joy or pity, and Daniel grew up in that atmosphere, terrified by the secret knowledge of his guilt and the damnation that awaited him. Shortly after his mother\u0027s murder Daniel began to have trouble with his vision. The doctors called the problem psychosomatic.\n \"He\u0027s blocking out something he doesn\u0027t want to see,\" the doctors said.\n The lenses on his glasses grew thicker.\n At seventeen Daniel ran away from Aunt Mattie and Texas forever. He hitchhiked to New York, where he was hired a messenger boy by the International Insurance Protection Association. Within three years he was promoted to an investigator. He became the best they had. He never demanded raise in salary or better working conditions. He was oblivious to those things. He was the Lord\u0027s right arm, his scourge, punishing the wicked.\n Daniel Cooper rose from his bath and prepared for bed. Tomorrow, he thought. Tomorrow will be the whore\u0027s day of retribution.\n He wished his mother could be there to see it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-tomorrow-comes/page-33.html","bookId":2359,"book":{"id":2359,"title":"If Tomorrow Comes","description":"Storyline: \n This is a story of intrigue and revenge.
