Doris Whitney looked around the bedroom for the last time to make certain that the pleasant room, grown dear over the past thirty years, was neat and tidy. She opened the drawer of the bedside table and carefully removed the gun. It was shiny black, and terrifyingly cold. She placed it next to the telephone and dialed her daughter\u0027s number in Philadelphia. She listened to the echo of the distant ringing. And then there was a soft \"Hello?\"\\n\\n \"Tracy... I just felt like hearing the sound of your voice, darling.\"\\n\\n \"What a nice surprise, Mother.\"\\n\\n \"I hope I didn\u0027t wake you up.\"\\n\\n \"No. I was reading. Just getting ready to go to sleep. Charles and I were going out for dinner, but the weather\u0027s too nasty. It\u0027s snowing hard here. What\u0027s it doing there?\"\\n\\n Dear God, we\u0027re talking about the weather, Doris Whitney thought, when there\u0027s so much I want to tell her. And can\u0027t.\\n\\n \"Mother? Are you there?\"\\n\\n Doris Whitney stared out the window. \"It\u0027s raining.\" And she thought, How melodramatically appropriate. Like an Alfred Hitchcock movie.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that noise?\" Tracy asked.\\n\\n Thunder. Too deeply wrapped in her thoughts, Doris had not been aware of it. New Orleans was having a storm. Continued rain, the weatherman had said. Sixty-six degrees in New Orleans. By evening the rain will be turning to thundershowers. Be sure to carry your umbrellas. She would not need an umbrella.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s thunder, Tracy.\" She forced a note of cheerfulness into her voice. \"Tell me what\u0027s happening in Philadelphia.\"\\n\\n \"I feel like a princess in a fairy tale, Mother,\" Tracy said. \"I never believed anyone could be so happy. Tomorrow night I\u0027m meeting Charles\u0027s parents.\" She deepened her voice as though making a pronouncement. \"The Stanhopes, of Chestnut Hill,\" she sighed. \"They\u0027re an institution. I have butterflies the size of dinosaurs.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry. They\u0027ll love you, darling.\"\\n\\n \"Charles says it doesn\u0027t matter. He loves me. And I adore him. I can\u0027t wait for you to meet him. He\u0027s fantastic.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he is.\" She would never meet Charles. She would never hold a grandchild in her lap. No. I must not think about that. \"Does he know how lucky he is to have you, baby?\"\\n\\n \"I keep telling him.\" Tracy laughed. \"Enough about me. Tell me what\u0027s going on there. How are you feeling?\"\\n\\n You\u0027re in perfect health, Doris, were Dr. Rush\u0027s words. You\u0027ll live to be a hundred. One of life\u0027s little ironies. \"I feel wonderful.\" Talking to you.\\n\\n \"Got a boyfriend yet?\" Tracy teased.\\n\\n Since Tracy\u0027s father had died five years earlier, Doris Whitney had not even considered going out with another man, despite Tracy\u0027s encouragement.\\n\\n \"No boyfriends.\" She changed the subject. \"How is your job? Still enjoying it?\"\\n\\n \"I love it. Charles doesn\u0027t mind if I keep working after we\u0027re married.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s wonderful, baby. He sounds like a very understanding man.\"\\n\\n \"He is. You\u0027ll see for yourself.\"\\n\\n There was a loud clap of thunder, like an offstage cue. It was time. There was nothing more to say except a final farewell. \"Good-bye, my darling.\" She kept her voice carefully steady.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you at the wedding, Mother. I\u0027ll call you as soon as Charles and I set a date.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" There was one final thing to say, after all. \"I love you very, very much, Tracy.\" And Doris Whitney carefully replaced the receiver.\\n\\n She picked up the gun. There was only one way to do it. Quickly. She raised the gun to her temple and squeezed the trigger. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-tomorrow-comes/page-1.html","bookId":2359,"book":{"id":2359,"title":"If Tomorrow Comes","description":"Storyline: This is a story of intrigue and revenge.
