{"id":68080,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Old Iron Pants had Tracy Whitney assigned to the laundry. Of the thirty-five work assignments available to prisoners, the laundry was the worst. The enormous, hot room was filled with rows of washing machines and ironing boards, and the loads of laundry that poured in were endless. Filling and emptying the washing machines and toting heavy baskets to the ironing section was a mindless, backbreaking job.\n Work began at 6:00 A.M., and prisoners were permitted one 10-minute rest period every two hours. By the end of the nine-hour day, most of the women were ready to drop from exhaustion. Tracy went about her work mechanically, speaking to no one, cocooned in her own thoughts.\n When Ernestine Littlechap heard about Tracy\u0027s assignment, she remarked, \"Old Iron Pants is out for your ass.\"\n Tracy said, \"She doesn\u0027t bother me.\"\n Ernestine Littlechap was puzzled. This was a different woman from the terrified young girl who had been brought into the prison three weeks earlier. Something had changed her, and Ernestine Littlechap was curious to know what it was.\n On Tracy\u0027s eighth day working in the laundry, a guard came up to her in the early afternoon. \"I got a transfer here for you. You\u0027re assigned to the kitchen.\" The most coveted job in the prison.\n There were two standards of food in the penitentiary: The prisoners ate hash, hot dogs, beans, or inedible casseroles, while the meals for the guards and prison officials were prepared by professional chefs. Their range of meals included steaks, fresh fish, chops, chicken, fresh vegetables and fruits, and tempting desserts. The convicts who worked in the kitchen had access to those meals, and they took full advantage of it.\n When Tracy reported to the kitchen, she was somehow not surprised to see Ernestine Littlechap there.\n Tracy approached her. \"Thank you.\" With difficulty, she forced a friendly note into her voice.\n Ernestine grunted and said nothing.\n \"How did you get me past Old Iron Pants?\"\n \"She ain\u0027t with us no mo\u0027.\"\n \"What happened to her?\"\n \"We got a little system. If a guard is hard-ass and starts givin\u0027 us too much of a bad time, we get rid of \u0027em.\"\n \"You mean the warden listens to - ?\"\n \"Shee-et. What\u0027s the warden got to do with it?\"\n \"Then how can you - ?\"\n \"It\u0027s easy. When the guard you want to get rid of is on duty, hassles begin to happen. Complaints start comin\u0027 in. A prisoner reports that Old Iron Pants grabbed her pussy. The next day \u0027nother prisoner accuses her of brutality. Then someone complains she took somethin\u0027 from her cell - say a radio - and sure enough, it turns up in Old Iron Pants\u0027s room. Old Iron Pants is gone. The guards don\u0027t run this prison, we do.\"\n \"What are you in here for?\" Tracy asked. She had no interest in the answer. The important thing was to establish a friendly relationship with this woman.\n \"Through no fault of Ernestine Littlechap, you\u0027d better believe it. I had a whole bunch of girls workin\u0027 for me.\"\n Tracy looked at her. \"You mean as - ?\" She hesitated.\n \"Hookers?\" She laughed.. \"Naw. They worked as maids in big homes. I opened me a employment agency. I had at least twenty girls. Rich folks have a hell of a time findin\u0027 maids. I did a lot of fancy advertisin\u0027 in the best newspapers, and when they called me I placed my girls with \u0027em. The girls would size up the houses, and when their employers was at work or outta town, the girls would gather up all the silver and jewelry and furs and whatever other goodies were around and skip.\" Ernestine sighed. \"If I told you how much fuckin\u0027 tax-free money we was pullin\u0027 down, you wouldn\u0027t believe me.\"\n \"How did you get caught?\"\n \"It was the fickle finger of fate, honey. One of my maids was servin\u0027 a luncheon at the mayor\u0027s house, and one of the guests was a old lady the maid had worked for and cleaned out. When the police used hoses on her, my girl began singin\u0027, and she sang the whole opera, and here\u0027s poor of Ernestine.\"\n They were standing at a stove by themselves. \"I can\u0027t stay in this place,\" Tracy whispered. \"I\u0027ve got to take care of something on the outside. Will you help me escape? I - \"\n \"Start slicin\u0027 up them onions., We\u0027re havin\u0027 Irish stew tonight.\"\n And she walked away.\n The prison grapevine was incredible. The prisoners knew everything that was going to happen long before it occurred. Inmates known as garbage rats picked up discarded memos, eavesdropped on phone calls, and read the warden\u0027s mail, and all information was carefully digested and sent around to the inmates who were important. Ernestine Littlechap was at the head of the list. Tracy was aware of how the guards and prisoners deferred to Ernestine. Since the other inmates had decided that Ernestine had become Tracy\u0027s protector, she was left strictly alone. Tracy waited warily for Ernestine to make advances toward her, but the big black kept her distance. Why? Tracy wondered.\n Rule number 7 in the official ten-page pamphlet issued to new prisoners read, \"Any form of sex is strictly forbidden. There will be no more than four inmates to a cell. Not more than one prisoner shall be permitted to be on a bunk at one time.\"\n The reality was so startlingly different that the prisoners referred to the pamphlet as the prison joke book. As the weeks went by, Tracy watched new prisoners - fish - enter the prison every day, and the pattern was always the same. First offenders who were sexually normal never had a chance. They came in timid and frightened, and the bull-dykes were there, waiting. The drama was enacted in planned stages. In a terrifying and hostile world, the bull-dyke was friendly and sympathetic. She would invite her victim to the recreation hall, where they would watch television together, and when the bull-dyke held her hand, the new prisoner would allow it, afraid of offending her only friend. The new prisoner quickly noticed that the other inmates left her alone, and as her dependence on the bull-dyke grew, so did the intimacies, until finally, she was willing to do anything to hold onto her only friend.\n Those who refused to give in were raped. Ninety percent of the women who entered the prison were forced into homosexual activity - willingly or unwillingly - within the first thirty days. Tracy was horrified.\n \"How can the authorities allow it to happen?\" she asked Ernestine.\n \"It\u0027s the system,\" Ernestine explained, \"and it\u0027s the same in every prison, baby. There ain\u0027t no way you can separate twelve hundred women from their men and expect them not to fuck somebody. We don\u0027t just rape for sex. We rape for power, to show \u0027em right off who\u0027s boss. The new fish who come in here are targets for everybody who wants to gang-fuck \u0027em. The only protection they got is to become the wife of a bull-dyke. That way, nobody\u0027ll mess with \u0027em.\"\n Tracy had reason to know she was listening to an expert.\n \"It ain\u0027t only the inmates,\" Ernestine went on. \"The guards are jest as bad. Some fresh meat comes in and she\u0027s on H. She\u0027s strung out and needs a fix real bad. She\u0027s sweatin\u0027 and shakin\u0027 herself to pieces. Well, the matron can get heroin for her, but the matron wants a little favor in exchange, see? So the fish goes down on the matron and she gets her fix. The male guards are even worse. They got keys to these cells, and all they have to do is walk in at night and he\u0027p themselves to free pussy. They might get you pregnant, but they can do a lot of favors. You want a candy bar or a visit from your boyfriend, you give the guard a piece of ass. It\u0027s called barterin\u0027, and it goes on in every prison system in the country.\"\n \"It\u0027s horrible!\"\n \"It\u0027s survival.\" The overhead cell light shone on Ernestine\u0027s bald head. \"You know why they don\u0027t allow no chewin\u0027 gum in this place?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Because the girls use it to jam up the locks on the doors so they don\u0027t close all the way, and at night they slip out and visit one another. We follow the rules we want to follow. The girls who make it out of here may be dumb, but they\u0027re smart dumb.\"\n Love affairs within the prison walls flourished, and the protocol between lovers was even more strictly enforced than on the outside. In an unnatural world, the artificial roles of studs and wives were created and played out. The studs assumed a man\u0027s role in a world where there were no men. They changed their names. Ernestine was called Ernie; Tessie was Tex; Barbara became Bob; Katherine was Kelly. The stud cut her hair short or shaved her head, and she did no chores. The Mary Femme, the wife, was expected to do the cleaning, mending, and ironing for her stud. Lola and Paulita competed fiercely for Ernestine\u0027s attentions, each fighting to outdo the other.\n The jealousy was fierce and frequently led to violence, and if the wife was caught looking at another stud or talking to one in the prison yard, tempers would flare. Love letters were constantly flying around the prison, delivered by the garbage rats.\n The letters were folded into small triangular shapes, known as kites, so they could easily be hidden in a bra or a shoe. Tracy saw kites being passed among women as they brushed by one another entering the dining hall or on their way to work.\n Time after time, Tracy watched inmates fall in love with their guards. It was a love born of despair and helplessness and submissiveness. The prisoners were dependent on the guards for everything: their food, their well-being, and sometimes, their lives. Tracy allowed herself to feel no emotion for anyone.\n Sex went on day and night. It occurred in the shower room, in toilets, in cells, and at night there was oral sex through the bars. The Mary Femmes who belonged to guards were let out of their cells at night to go to the guards\u0027 quarters.\n After lights out, Tracy would lie in her bunk and put her hands over her ears to shut out the sounds.\n One night Ernestine pulled out a box of Rice Krispies from under her bunk and began scattering them in the corridor outside the cell. Tracy could hear inmates from other cells doing the same thing.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" Tracy asked.\n Ernestine turned to her and said harshly, \"Non\u0027a your business. Jest stay in your bunk. Jest stay in your fuckin\u0027 bunk.\"\n A few minutes later there was a terrified scream from a nearby cell, where a new prisoner had just arrived. \"Oh, God, no. Don\u0027t! Please leave me alone!\"\n Tracy knew then what was happening, and she was sick inside. The screams went on and on, until they finally diminished into helpless, racking sobs. Tracy squeezed her eyes tightly shut, filled with burning rage. How could women do this to one another? She had thought that prison had hardened her, but when she awoke in the morning, her face was stained with dried tears.\n She was determined not to show her feelings to Ernestine. Tracy asked casually, \"What were the Rice Krispies for?\"\n \"That\u0027s our early warnin\u0027 system. If the guards try sneakin\u0027 up on us, we kin hear \u0027em comin\u0027.\"\n Tracy soon learned why inmates referred to a term in the penitentiary as \"going to college.\" Prison was an educational experience, but what the prisoners learned was unorthodox.\n The prison was filled with experts in every conceivable type of crime. They exchanged methods of grifting, shoplifting, and rolling drunks. They brought one another up to date on badger games and exchanged information on snitches and undercover cops.\n In the recreation yard one morning, Tracy listened to an older inmate give a seminar on pickpocketing to a fascinated young group.\n \"The real pros come from Colombia. They got a school in Bogot��, called the school of the ten bells, where you pay twenty-five hundred bucks to learn to be a pickpocket. They hang a dummy from the ceilin\u0027, dressed in a suit with ten pockets, filled with money and jewelry.\"\n \"What\u0027s the gimmick?\"\n \"The gimmick is that each pocket has a belt on it. You don\u0027t graduate till you kin empty every damn pocket without ringin\u0027 the bell.\"\n Lola sighed, \"I used to go with a guy who walked through crowds dressed in an overcoat, with both his hands out in the open, while he picked everybody\u0027s pockets like crazy.\"\n \"How the hell could he do that?\"\n \"The right hand was a dummy. He slipped his real hand through a slit in the coat and picked his way through pockets and wallets and purses.\"\n In the recreation room the education continued.\n \"I like the locker-key rip-off,\" a veteran said. \"You hang around a railroad station till you see a little old lady tryin\u0027 to lift a suitcase or a big package into one a them lockers. You put it in for her and hand her the key. Only it\u0027s the key to an empty locker. When she leaves, you empty her locker and split.\"\n In the yard another afternoon, two inmates convicted of prostitution and possession of cocaine were talking to a new arrival, a pretty young girl who looked no more than seventeen.\n \"No wonder you got busted, honey,\" one of the older women scolded. \"Before you talk price to a John, you gotta pat him down to make sure he ain\u0027t carryin\u0027 a gun, and never tell him what you\u0027re gonna do for him. Make him tell you what he wants. Then if he turns out to be a cop, it\u0027s entrapment, see?\"\n The other pro added, \"Yeah. And always took at their hands. If a trick says he\u0027s a workin\u0027 man, see if his hands are rough. That\u0027s the tip-off. A lot of plainclothes cops wear workin\u0027 men\u0027s outfits, but when it comes to their hands, they forget, so their hands are smooth.\"\n Time went neither slowly nor quickly. It was simply time. Tracy though of St. Augustine\u0027s aphorism: \"What is time? If no one asks me, I know. But if I have to explain it, I do not know.\"\n The routine of the prison never varied:\n 4:40 A.M. Warning bell\n 4:45 A.M. Rise and dress\n 5:00 A.M. Breakfast\n 5:30 A.M. Return to cell\n 5:55 A.M. Warning bell\n 6:00 A.M. Work detail lineup\n 10:00 A.M. Exercise yard\n 10:30 A.M. Lunch\n 11:00 A.M. Work detail lineup\n 3:30 P.M. Supper\n 4:00 P.M. Return to cell\n 5:00 P.M. Recreation room\n 6:00 P.M. Return to cell\n 8:45 P.M. Warning bell\n 9:00 P.M. Lights out\n The rules were inflexible. All inmates had to go to meals, and no talking was permitted in the lines. No more than five cosmetic items could be kept in the small cell lockers. Beds had to be made prior to breakfast and kept neat during the day.\n The penitentiary had a music all its own: the clanging bells, shuffle of feet on cement, slamming iron doors, day whispers and night screams... the hoarse crackle of the guards\u0027 walkie-talkies, the clash of trays at mealtime. And always there was the barbed wire and the high walls and the loneliness and isolation and the pervading aura of hate.\n Tracy became a model prisoner. Her body responded automatically to the sounds of prison routine: the bar sliding across her cell at count time and sliding back at wake-up time; the bell for reporting to work and the buzzer when work was finished.\n Tracy\u0027s body was a prisoner in this place, but her mind was free to plan her escape.\n Prisoners could make no outside telephone calls, and they were permitted to receive two five-minute calls a month. Tracy received a call from Otto Schmidt.\n \"I thought you\u0027d want to know,\" he said awkwardly. \"It was a real nice funeral. I took care of the bills, Tracy.\"\n \"Thank you, Otto. I - thank you.\" There was nothing more for either of them to say.\n There were no more phone calls for her.\n \"Girl, you best forget the outside world,\" Ernestine warned her. \"There ain\u0027t nobody out there for you.\"\n You\u0027re wrong, Tracy thought grimly.\n Joe Romano\n Perry Pope\n Judge Henry Lawrence\n Anthony Orsatti\n Charles Stanhope III\n It was in the exercise yard that Tracy encountered Big Bertha again. The yard was a large outdoor rectangle bounded by the high outer prison wall on one side and the inner wall of the prison on the other. The inmates were allowed in the yard for thirty minutes each morning. It was one of the few places where talking was permitted, and clusters of prisoners gathered together exchanging the latest news and gossip before lunch. When Tracy walked into the yard for the first time, she felt a sudden sense of freedom, and she realized it was because she was in the open air. She could see the sun, high above, and cumulus clouds, and somewhere in the distant blue sky she heard the drone of a plane, soaring free.\n \"You! I been lookin\u0027 for you,\" a voice said.\n Tracy turned to see the huge Swede who had brushed into her on Tracy\u0027s first day in prison.\n \"I hear you got yourself a nigger bull-dyke.\"\n Tracy started to brush past the woman. Big Bertha grabbed Tracy\u0027s arm, with an iron grip. \"Nobody walks away from me,\" she breathed. \"Be nice; littbarn.\" She was backing Tracy toward the wall, pressing her huge body into Tracy\u0027s.\n \"Get away from me.\"\n \"What you need is a real good lickin\u0027. You know what I mean? An\u0027 I\u0027m gonna give it to you. You\u0027re gonna be all mine, ��lskade.\"\n A familiar voice behind Tracy rasped, \"Get your fuckin\u0027 hands off her, you asshole.\"\n Ernestine Littlechap stood there, big fists clenched, eyes blazing, the sun reflecting off her shiny shaved skull.\n \"You ain\u0027t man enough for her, Ernie.\"\n \"I\u0027m man enough for you,\" the black woman exploded \"You bother her again, and I\u0027ll have your ass for breakfast. Fried.\"\n The air was suddenly charged with electricity. The two amazons were eyeing each other with naked hatred. They\u0027re ready to kill each other over me, Tracy thought. And then she realized it had very little to do with her. She remembered something Ernestine had told her: \"In this place, you have to fight, fuck, or hit the fence. You gotta hold your mud, or you\u0027re dead.\"\n It was Big Bertha who backed down. She gave Ernestine a contemptuous look. \"I ain\u0027t in no hurry.\" She leered at Tracy. \"You\u0027re gonna be here a long time, baby. So am I. I\u0027ll be seein\u0027 you.\"\n She turned and walked away.\n Ernestine watched her go. \"She\u0027s a bad mother. \u0027Member that nurse in Chicago who killed off all them patients? Stuck \u0027em full of cyanide and stayed there an\u0027 watched \u0027em die? Well, that angel of mercy is the one who got the hots for you, Whitney. Shee-et! You need a fuckin\u0027 keeper. She ain\u0027t gonna let up on you.\"\n \"Will you help me escape?\"\n A bell rang.\n \"It\u0027s chow time,\" Ernestine Littlechap said.\n That night, lying in her bunk, Tracy thought about Ernestine.\n Even though she had never tried to touch Tracy again, Tracy still did not trust her. She could never forget what Ernestine and her other cell mates had done to her. But she needed the black woman.\n Each afternoon after supper, the inmates were allowed to spend one hour in the recreation room, where they could watch television or talk or read the latest magazines and newspapers. Tracy was thumbing through a copy of a magazine when a photograph caught her eye. It was a wedding picture of Charles Stanhope III and his new bride, coming out of a chapel, arm in arm, laughing. It hit Tracy like a blow. Seeing his photograph now, the happy smile on his face, she was filled with a pain that turned to cold fury. She had once planned to share her life with this man, and he had turned his back on her, let them destroy her, let their baby die. But that was another time, another place, another world. That was fantasy. This is reality.\n Tracy slammed the magazine shut.\n On visiting days it was easy to know which inmates had friends or relatives coming to see them. The prisoners would shower and put on fresh clothes and makeup. Ernestine usually returned from the visitors\u0027 room smiling and cheerful.\n \"My Al, he always comes to see me,\" she told Tracy. \"He\u0027ll be waitin\u0027 for me when I get out. You know why? \u0027Cause I give him what no other woman gives him.\"\n Tracy could not hide her confusion. \"You mean... sexually?\"\n \"You bet your ass. What goes on behind these walls has nothin\u0027 to do with the outside. In here, sometimes we need a warm body to hold - somebody to touch us and tell us they love us. We gotta feel there\u0027s somebody who gives a damn about us. It don\u0027t matter if it ain\u0027t real or don\u0027t last. It\u0027s all we got. But when I get on the outside\" - Emestine broke into a broad grin - \"then I become a fuckin\u0027 nymphomaniac, hear?\"\n There was something that had been puzzling Tracy. She decided to bring it up now. \"Ernie, you keep protecting me. Why?\"\n Ernestine shrugged. \"Beats the shit out of me.\"\n \"I really want to know.\" Tracy chose her words carefully. \"Everyone else who\u0027s your - your friend belongs to you. They do whatever you tell them to do.\"\n \"If they don\u0027t want to walk around with half an ass, yeah.\"\n \"But not me. Why?\"\n \"You complainin\u0027?\"\n \"No. I\u0027m curious.\"\n Ernestine thought about it for a moment. \"Okay. You got somethin\u0027 I want.\" She saw the look on Tracy\u0027s face. \"No, not that. I get alla that I want, baby. You got class. I mean, real, honest-to-God class. Like those cool ladies you see in Vogue and Town and Country, all dressed up and servin\u0027 tea from silver pots. That\u0027s where you belong. This ain\u0027t your world. I don\u0027t know how you got mixed up with all that rat shit on the outside, but my guess is you got suckered by somebody.\" She looked at Tracy and said, almost shyly, \"I ain\u0027t come across many decent things in my life. You\u0027re one of \u0027em.\" She turned away so that her next words were almost inaudible. \"And I\u0027m sorry about your kid. I really am....\"\n That night, after lights out, Tracy whispered in the dark, \"Ernie, I\u0027ve go to escape. Help me. Please.\"\n \"I\u0027m tryin\u0027 to sleep, for Christ\u0027s sake! Shut up now, hear?\"\n Ernestine initiated Tracy into the arcane language of the prison. Groups of women in the yard were talking: \"This bull-dyker dropped the belt on the gray broad, and from then on you had to feed her with a long-handled spoon....\"\n \"She was short, but they caught her in a snowstorm, and a stoned cop turned her over to the butcher. That ended her getup. Good-bye, Ruby-do....\"\n To Tracy, it was like listening to a group of Martians. \"What are they talking about?\" she asked.\n Ernestine roared with laughter. \"Don\u0027t you speak no English, girl? When the lesbian \u0027dropped the belt,\u0027 it meant she switched from bein\u0027 the guy to bein\u0027 a Mary Femme. She got involved with a \u0027gray broad\u0027 - that\u0027s a honky, like you. She couldn\u0027t be trusted, so that meant you stayed away from her. She was \u0027short,\u0027 meanin\u0027 she was near the end of her prison sentence, but she got caught takin\u0027 heroin by a stoned cop - that\u0027s someone who lives by the rules and can\u0027t be bought - and they sent her to the \u0027butcher,\u0027 the prison doctor.\"\n \"What\u0027s a \u0027Ruby-do\u0027 and a \u0027getup\u0027?\"\n \"Ain\u0027t you learned nothin\u0027? A \u0027Ruby-do\u0027 is a parole. A \u0027getup\u0027 is the day of release.\"\n Tracy knew she would wait for neither.\n The explosion between Ernestine Littlechap and Big Bertha happened in the yard the following day. The prisoners were playing a game of softball, supervised by the guards. Big Bertha, at bat with two strikes against her, hit a hard line drive on the third pitch and ran to first base, which Tracy was covering. Big Bertha slammed into Tracy, knocking her down, and then was on top of her. Her hands snaked up between Tracy\u0027s legs, and she whispered, \"Nobody says no to me, you cunt. I\u0027m comin\u0027 to get you tonight, littbarn, and I\u0027m gonna fuck your ass off.\"\n Tracy fought wildly to get loose. Suddenly, she felt Big Bertha being lifted off her. Ernestine had the huge Swede by the neck and was throttling her.\n \"You goddamn bitch!\" Ernestine was screaming. \"I warned you!\" She slashed her fingernails across Big Bertha\u0027s face, clawing at her eyes.\n \"I\u0027m blind!\" Big Bertha screamed: \"I\u0027m blind!\" She grabbed Ernestine\u0027s breasts and starting pulling them. The two women were punching and clawing at each other as four guards came running up. It took the guards five minutes to pull them apart. Both women were taken to the infirmary. It was late that night when Ernestine was returned to her cell. Lola and Paulita hurried to her bunk to console her.\n \"Are you all right?\" Tracy whispered.\n \"Damned right,\" Ernestine told her. Her voice sounded muffled, and Tracy wondered how badly she had been hurt. \"I made my Ruby-do yesterday. I\u0027m gettin\u0027 outta this joint. You got a problem. That mother ain\u0027t gonna leave you alone now. No way. And when she\u0027s finished fuckin\u0027 with you, she\u0027s gonna kill you.\"\n They lay there in the silent darkness. Finally, Ernestine spoke again. \"Maybe it\u0027s time you and me talked about bustin\u0027 you the hell outta here.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-tomorrow-comes/page-9.html","bookId":2359,"book":{"id":2359,"title":"If Tomorrow Comes","description":"Storyline: \n This is a story of intrigue and revenge.
