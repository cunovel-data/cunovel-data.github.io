{"id":68079,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"A matron came up to Tracy and announced, \"You got a visitor, Whitney.\"\\n\\n Tracy looked at her in surprise. \"A visitor?\" Who could it be? And suddenly she knew. Charles. He had come after all. But he was too late. He had not been there when she had so desperately needed him. Well, I\u0027ll never need him again. Or anyone else.\\n\\n Tracy followed the matron down the corridor to the visitors\u0027 room.\\n\\n Tracy stepped inside.\\n\\n A total stranger was seated at a small wooden table. He was one of the most unattractive men Tracy had ever seen. He was short, with a bloated, androgynous body, a long, pinched-in nose, and a small, bitter mouth. He had a high, bulging forehead and intense brown eyes, magnified by the thick lenses of his glasses.\\n\\n He did not rise. \"My name is Daniel Cooper. The warden gave me permission to speak to you.\"\\n\\n \"About what?\" Tracy asked suspiciously.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m an investigator for IIPA - the International Insurance Protection Association. One of our clients insured the Renoir that was stolen from Mr. Joseph Romano.\"\\n\\n Tracy drew a deep breath. \"I can\u0027t help you. I didn\u0027t steal it.\" She started for the door.\\n\\n Cooper\u0027s next words stopped her. \"I know that.\"\\n\\n Tracy turned and looked at him, wary, every sense alert.\\n\\n \"No one stole it. You were framed, Miss Whitney.\"\\n\\n Slowly, Tracy sank into a chair.\\n\\n Daniel Cooper\u0027s involvement with the case had begun three weeks earlier when he had been summoned to the office of his superior, J. J. Reynolds, at IIPA headquarters in Manhattan.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got an assignment for you, Dan,\" Reynolds said.\\n\\n Daniel Cooper loathed being called Dan.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll make this brief.\" Reynolds intended to make it brief because Cooper made him nervous. In truth, Cooper made everyone in the organization nervous. He was a strange man - weird, was how many described him. Daniel Cooper kept entirely to himself. No one knew where he lived, whether he was married or had children. He socialized with no one, and never attended office parties or office meetings. He was a loner, and the only reason Reynolds tolerated him was because the man was a goddamned genius. He was a bulldog, with a computer for a brain. Daniel Cooper was single-handedly responsible for recovering more stolen merchandise, and exposing more insurance frauds, than all the other investigators in the organization put together. Reynolds just wished he knew what the hell Cooper was all about. Merely sitting across from the man with those fanatical brown eyes staring at him made him uneasy.\\n\\n Reynolds said, \"One of our client companies insured a painting for half a million dollars and - \"\\n\\n \"The Renoir. New Orleans. Joe Romano. A woman named Tracy Whitney was convicted and sentenced to fifteen years. The painting hasn\u0027t been recovered.\"\\n\\n The son of a bitch! Reynolds thought. If it were anyone else, I\u0027d think he was showing off. \"That\u0027s right,\" Reynolds acknowledged grudgingly. \"The Whitney woman has stashed that painting away somewhere, and we want it back. Go to it.\"\\n\\n Cooper turned and left the office without a word. Watching him leave, J. J. Reynolds thought, not for the first time, Someday I\u0027m going to find out what makes that bastard tick.\\n\\n Cooper walked through the office, where fifty employees were working side by side, programming computers, typing reports, answering telephones. It was bedlam.\\n\\n As Cooper passed a desk, a colleague said, \"I hear you got the Romano assignment. Lucky you. New Orleans is - \"\\n\\n Cooper walked by without replying. Why couldn\u0027t they leave him alone? That was all he asked of anybody, but they were always pestering him with their nosy overtures.\\n\\n It had become a game in the office. They were determined to break through his mysterious reserve and find out who he really was.\\n\\n \"What are you doing for dinner Friday night, Dan...?\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re not married, Sarah and I know a wonderful girl, Dan...?\"\\n\\n Couldn\u0027t they see he did not need any of them - didn\u0027t want any of them?\\n\\n \"Come on, it\u0027s only for a drink....\"\\n\\n But Daniel Cooper knew what that could lead to. An innocent drink could lead to dinner, and a dinner could start friendships, and friendships could lead to confidences. Too dangerous.\\n\\n Daniel Cooper lived in mortal terror that one day someone would learn about his past. Let the dead past bury its dead was a lie. The dead never stayed buried. Every two or three years one of the scandal sheets would dig up the old scandal, and Daniel Cooper would disappear for several days. Those were the only times he ever got drunk.\\n\\n Daniel Cooper could have kept a psychiatrist busy full-time had he been able to expose his emotions, but he could never bring himself to speak of the past to anyone. The one piece of physical evidence that he retained from that terrible day long ago was a faded, yellowed newspaper clipping, safety locked away in his room, where no one could ever find it. He looked at it from time to time as a punishment, but every word in the article was emblazoned on his mind.\\n\\n He showered or bathed at least three times a day, but never felt clean. He firmly believed in hell and hell\u0027s fire, and he knew his only salvation on earth was expiation, atonement. He had tried to join the New York police force, but when he had failed the physical because he was four inches too short, he had become a private investigator. He thought of himself as a hunter, tracking down those who broke the law. He was the vengeance of God, the instrument that brought down God\u0027s wrath on the heads of wrongdoers. It was the only way he could atone for the past, and prepare himself for eternity.\\n\\n He wondered if there was time to take a shower before he caught his plane.\\n\\n Daniel Cooper\u0027s first stop was New Orleans. He spent five days in the city, and before he was through, he knew everything he needed to know about Joe Romano, Anthony Orsatti, Perry Pope, and Judge Henry Lawrence. Cooper read the transcripts of Tracy Whitney\u0027s court hearing and sentencing. He interviewed Lieutenant Miller and learned about the suicide of Tracy Whitney\u0027s mother. He talked to Otto Schmidt and found out how Whitney\u0027s company had been stripped. During all these meetings, Daniel Cooper made not one note, yet he could have recited every conversation verbatim. He was 99 percent sure that Tracy Whitney was an innocent victim, but to Daniel Cooper, those were unacceptable odds. He flew to Philadelphia and talked to Clarence Desmond, vice-president of the bank where Tracy Whitney had worked. Charles Stanhope III had refused to meet with him.\\n\\n Now, as Cooper looked at the woman seated across from him, he was 100 percent convinced that she had had nothing to do with the theft of the painting. He was ready to write his report.\\n\\n \"Romano framed you, Miss Whitney. Sooner or later, he would have put in a claim for the theft of that painting. You just happened to come along at the right moment to make it easy for him.\"\\n\\n Tracy could feel her heartbeat accelerate. This man knew she was innocent. He probably had enough evidence against Joe Romano to clear her. He would speak to the warden or the governor, and get her out of this nightmare. She found it suddenly difficult to breathe. \"Then you\u0027ll help me?\"\\n\\n Daniel Cooper was puzzled. \"Help you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Get a pardon or - \"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n The word was like a slap. \"No? But why? If you know I\u0027m innocent \"\\n\\n How could people be so stupid? \"My assignment is finished.\"\\n\\n When he returned to his hotel room, the first thing Cooper did was to undress and step into the shower. He scrubbed himself from head to foot, letting the steaming-hot spray wash over his body for almost half an hour. When he had dried himself and dressed, he sat down and wrote his report.\\n\\n To: J. J. Reynolds\\n\\n File No. Y-72-830-412\\n\\n FROM: Daniel Cooper\\n\\n SUBJECT: Deux Femmes dans le Caf�� Rouge, Renoir - Oil on Canvas\\n\\n It is my conclusion that Tracy Whitney is in no way involved in the theft of above painting. I believe that Joe Romano took out the insurance policy with the intention of faking a burglary, collecting the insurance, and reselling the painting to a private party, and that by this time the painting is probably out of the country. Since the painting is well known, I would expect it to turn up in Switzerland, which has a good-faith purchase and protection law. If a purchaser says he bought a work of art in good faith, the Swiss government permits him to keep it, even though it is stolen.\\n\\n Recommendation: Since there is no concrete proof of Romano\u0027s guilt, our client will have to pay him off on the policy. Further, it would be useless to look to Tracy Whitney for either the recovery of the painting or damages, since she has neither knowledge of the painting nor any assets that I have been able to uncover. In addition, she will be incarcerated in the Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women for the next fifteen years.\\n\\n Daniel Cooper stopped a moment to think about Tracy Whitney. He supposed other men would consider her beautiful. He wondered, without any real interest, what fifteen years in prison would do to her. It had nothing to do with him.\\n\\n Daniel Cooper signed the memo and debated whether he had time to take another shower. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-tomorrow-comes/page-8.html","bookId":2359,"book":{"id":2359,"title":"If Tomorrow Comes","description":"Storyline: This is a story of intrigue and revenge.
