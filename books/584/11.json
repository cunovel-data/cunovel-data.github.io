{"id":18256,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I\u0027ve got up in a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm. I\u0027ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways; and then I\u0027ve recollected his confirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.\n One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand; a rough sand pillar, with the letters W.H. cut on its north side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T.G. It serves as guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all at once, a gush of child\u0027s sensations flowed into my heart. Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed long at the weather-worn block, and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate. `Poor Hindley!\u0027 I exclaimed involuntarily. I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead! I thought--or should die soon!--supposing it were a sign of death! The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I trembled in every limb. The apparition had outstripped me: it stood looking through the gate. That was my first idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars. Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, my Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten months since. \n `God bless thee, darling!\u0027 I cried, forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears. `Hareton, it\u0027s Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.\u0027 \n He retreated out of arm\u0027s length, and picked up a large flint. \n `I am come to see thy father, Hareton,\u0027 I added, guessing from the action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognized as one with me. \n He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued, from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than angered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him. I showed another, keeping it out of his reach. \n `Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?\u0027 I inquired. `The curate?\u0027 \n `Damn the curate, and thee! Gie me that,\u0027 he replied. \n `Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,\u0027 said I. `Who\u0027s your master?\u0027 \n `Devil daddy,\u0027 was his answer. \n `And what do you learn from daddy?\u0027 I continued. \n He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. `What does he teach you?\u0027 I asked. \n `Naught,\u0027 said he, `but to keep out of his gait. Daddy cannot bide me, because I swear at him.\u0027 \n `Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?\u0027 I observed. \n `Ah--nay,\u0027 he drawled. \n `Who then?\u0027 \n `Heathcliff.\u0027 \n I asked if he liked Mr Heathcliff. \n `Ay!\u0027 he answered again. \n Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the sentences--`I known\u0027t: he pays dad back what he gies to me--he curses daddy for cursing me. He says I mun do as I will.\u0027 \n `And the curate does not teach you to read and write then?\u0027 I pursued. \n `No, I was told the curate should have his--teeth dashed down his throat,--if he stepped over the threshold--Heathcliff had promised that!\u0027 \n I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate. He went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the doorstones; and I turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin. This is not much connected with Miss Isabella\u0027s affair: except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs Linton\u0027s pleasure. \n The next time Heathcliff came, my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and we found it a great comfort. Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as soon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house front. I was standing by the kitchen window, but I drew out of sight. He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said something: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face: he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer. There was another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her. \n `Judas! traitor!\u0027 I ejaculated. `You are a hypocrite, too, are you? A deliberate deceiver.\u0027 \n `Who is, Nelly?\u0027 said Catherine\u0027s voice at my elbow: I had been over intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance. \n `Your worthless friend!\u0027 I answered warmly: `the sneaking rascal yonder. Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us--he is coming in! I wonder will he have the art to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss, when he told you he hated her?\u0027 \n Mrs Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn\u0027t withhold giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue. \n `To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!\u0027 she cried. `You want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you about, raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone!--I beg you will, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to draw the bolts against you!\u0027 \n `God forbid that he should try!\u0027 answered the black villain. I detested him just then. `God keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder after sending him to heaven!\u0027 \n `Hush!\u0027 said Catherine, shutting the inner door. `Don\u0027t vex me. Why have you disregarded my request? Did she come across you on purpose?\u0027 \n `What is it to you?\u0027 he growled. `I.have a right to kiss her, if she chooses; and you have no right to object. I\u0027m not your husband: you needn\u0027t be jealous of me!\u0027 \n `I\u0027m not jealous of you,\u0027 replied the mistress, `I\u0027m jealous for you. Clear your face: you shan\u0027t scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you shall marry her. But do you like her? Tell the truth, Heathcliff! There, you won\u0027t answer. I\u0027m certain you don\u0027t!\u0027 \n `And would Mr Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?\u0027 I inquired. \n `Mr Linton should approve,\u0027 returned my lady, decisively. \n `He might spare himself the trouble,\u0027 said Heathcliff: `I could do as well without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware that I know you have treated me infernally--infernally! Do you hear? And if you flatter yourself that I don\u0027t perceive it, you are a fool; and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot; and if you fancy I\u0027ll suffer unrevenged, I\u0027ll convince you of the contrary, in a very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me your sister-in-law\u0027s secret: I swear I\u0027ll make the most of it. And stand you aside!\u0027 \n `What new phase of his character is this?\u0027 exclaimed Mrs Linton, in amazement. `I\u0027ve treated you infernally--and you\u0027ll take your revenge! How will you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you infernally?\u0027 \n `I seek no revenge on you,\u0027 replied Heathcliff less vehemently. `That\u0027s not the plan. The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don\u0027t turn against him; they crush those beneath them. You are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are able. Having levelled my palace, don\u0027t erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you really wished me to marry Isabel, I\u0027d cut my throat!\u0027 \n `Oh, the evil is that I am not jealous, is it?\u0027 cried Catherine. `Well, I won\u0027t repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost soul. Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You prove it. Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel. Quarrel with Edgar, if you please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you\u0027ll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.\u0027 \n The conversation ceased. Mrs Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and gloomy. The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could neither lay nor control it. He stood on the hearth with folded arms, brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long. \n `Ellen,\u0027 said he, when I entered, `have you seen your mistress?\u0027 \n `Yes; she\u0027s in the kitchen, sir,\u0027 I answered. `She\u0027s sadly put out by Mr Heathcliff\u0027s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it\u0027s time to arrange his visits on another footing. There\u0027s harm in being too soft, and now it\u0027s come to this--`And I related the scene in the court, and, as near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could not be very prejudicial to Mrs Linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest. Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame. \n `This is insufferable!\u0027 he exclaimed. `It is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two men out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian--I have humoured her enough.\u0027 \n He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went, followed by me, to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion: Mrs Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the master first, and made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed, abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation. \n `How is this?\u0027 said Linton, addressing her; `what notion of propriety must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk, you think nothing of it; you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps, imagine I can get used to it too!\u0027 \n `Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?\u0027 asked the mistress, in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr Linton\u0027s attention to him. He succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion. \n `I have been so far forbearing with you, sir,\u0027 he said quietly; `not that I was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance, I acquiesced--foolishly. Your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to prevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into this house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure. Three minutes\u0027 delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.\u0027 \n Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision. \n `Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!\u0027 he said. `It is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God! Mr Linton, I\u0027m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!\u0027 \n My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men: he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the hint; but Mrs Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I attempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it. \n `Fair means!\u0027 she said, in answer to her husband\u0027s look of angry surprise `If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or allow yourself to be beaten. It will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess. No, I\u0027ll swallow the key before you shall get it! I\u0027m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant indulgence of one\u0027s weak nature, and the other\u0027s bad one, I earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for daring to think an evil thought of me.!\u0027 \n It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine\u0027s grasp, and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr Edgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale. For his life he could not avert that access of emotion; mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely. He leant on the back of a chair, and covered his face. \n `Oh, heavens! In old days, this would win you knighthood!\u0027 exclaimed Mrs Linton. `We are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as a king would march his army against a colony of mice. Cheer up! you shan\u0027t be hurt! Your type is not a lamb, it\u0027s a sucking leveret.\u0027 \n `I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!\u0027 said her friend. `I compliment you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering thing you preferred to me! I would not strike him with my fist, but I\u0027d kick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?\u0027 \n The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push. He\u0027d better have kept his distance; my master quickly sprang erect, and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man. It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr Linton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front entrance. \n `There! you\u0027ve done with coming here,\u0027 cried Catherine. `Get away, now; he\u0027ll return with a brace of pistols, and half a dozen assistants. If he did overhear us, of course he\u0027d never forgive you. You\u0027ve played him an ill turn, Heathcliff! But go--make haste! I\u0027d rather see Edgar at bay than you.\u0027 \n `Do you suppose I\u0027m going with that blow burning in my gullet?\u0027 he thundered. `By hell, no! I\u0027ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel nut before I cross the threshold! If I don\u0027t floor him now, I shall murder him some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!\u0027 \n `He\u0027s not coming,\u0027 I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. `There\u0027s the coachman and the two gardeners; you\u0027ll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them! Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be watching from the parlour windows, to see that they fulfil his orders.\u0027 \n The gardeners and coachman were there; but Linton was with them. They had already entered the court. Heathcliff, on second thoughts, resolved to avoid a struggle against the three underlings; he seized the poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as they tramped in. \n Mrs Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs. She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was anxious to keep her in ignorance. \n `I\u0027m nearly distracted, Nelly!\u0027 she exclaimed, throwing herself on the sofa. `A thousand smiths\u0027 hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or anyone else aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to Edgar, if you see him again tonight, that I\u0027m in danger of being seriously ill. I wish it may prove true. He has startled and distressed me shockingly! I want to frighten him. Besides, he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings; I\u0027m certain I should recriminate, and God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You are aware that I am in no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him to turn listener? Heathcliff\u0027s talk was outrageous, after you left us; but I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing. Now all is dashed wrong by the fool\u0027s craving to hear evil of self, that haunts some people like a demon! Had Edgar never gathered our conversation, he would never have been the worse for it. Really, when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for him, I did not care, hardly, what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long! Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend--if Edgar will be mean and jealous, I\u0027ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own. That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity! But it\u0027s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I\u0027d not take Linton by surprise with it. To this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that policy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy. I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of your countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.\u0027 \n The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt, rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but I believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish to `frighten\u0027 her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness. Therefore I said nothing when I met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together. He began to speak first. \n `Remain where you are, Catherine,\u0027 he said; without any anger in his voice, but with much sorrowful despondency. `I shall not stay. I am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn whether, after this evening\u0027s events, you intend to continue your intimacy with-- \n `Oh, for mercy\u0027s sake,\u0027 interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, `for mercy\u0027s sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.\u0027 \n `To get rid of me, answer my question,\u0027 persevered Mr Linton. `You must answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have found that you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please. Will you give up Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you to be my friend and his at the same time; and I absolutely require to know which you choose.\u0027 \n `I require to be let alone!\u0027 exclaimed Catherine furiously. `I demand it! Don\u0027t you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you--you leave me!\u0027 \n She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely. It was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages! There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters! Mr Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear. He told me to fetch some water. She had no breath for speaking. I brought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her face. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death. Linton looked terrified. \n `There is nothing in the world the matter,\u0027 I whispered. I did not want him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart. \n `She has blood on her lips!\u0027 he said, shuddering. \n `Never mind!\u0027 I answered tartly. And I told him how she had resolved, previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up--her hair flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her chamber door: she hindered me from going farther by securing it against me. \n As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask whether she would have some carried up. `No!\u0027 she replied peremptorily. The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow after, and received the same answer. Mr Linton, on his part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife\u0027s occupations. Isabella and he had had an hour\u0027s interview, during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for Heathcliff\u0027s advances: but he could make nothing of her evasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him.\n 有一回我到吉默吞去，绕道经过那古老的大门。大概就是我的故事正讲到的那个时期——一个晴朗而严寒的下午，地面是光秃秃的，道路又硬又干。我来到有一块大石头的地方，那儿大路岔开，左手一边通到荒野，有一根粗糙的沙柱，北面刻着W．H．，东面是G．，西南面是T．G．①。这是作为去田庄、山庄和村子的指路碑用的。太阳把它的灰顶照得黄黄的，使我想起了夏天。我说不出为什么，只是一霎时，一股孩子时的情感涌进我的心里。二十年前辛德雷和我们这儿当作留连忘返的地方。我对这块被风吹雨打的岩石盯了很久；又蹲下来，看见靠近地底下那一个洞，仍然装满了蜗牛和碎石子。这些东西以及另外一些容易消灭的东西都是我们喜欢储藏在那儿的。而且，像现实一样地鲜明，我好像看见我早年的游伴坐在那干枯的草皮上。他那黑黑的方方的头向前俯着，他的小手在用一块瓦掘土。 \n ①W．H．原文Wuthering Heights之缩写，即呼啸山庄。G．原文Gimmerton之缩写，即吉默吞。T．G．原文Thrushcross Grange之缩写，即画眉田庄。 \n “可怜的辛德雷！”我不禁叫出声来。我吓了一跳——我的肉眼一时恍惚，仿佛看见这孩子抬起脸来，而且直瞪着我！一眨眼工夫那张脸就消失了；可是，我立刻感到一种不可抗拒的渴望想到山庄去。迷信迫使我遵从了这个冲动——“假使他死了呢！”我想，“或者快死了吧！——恐怕这是个死的预兆吧！” \n 我越走近那所房子，我就越激动，等到一看到它，我四肢都发抖了。那个幻觉中的鬼怪已经赶到了我前面，它站在那儿隔道门栏望着我。那就是在我看到一个有着卷发和棕色眼睛的男孩，把他的红脸靠在门栏上时，我所起的第一个念头。再一回想到这一定是哈里顿。我的哈里顿，自从我在十个月以前离开他以后，他并没有多大改变。 \n ”天保佑你，宝贝！”我嚷道，立刻把我那愚蠢的恐惧忘掉了。“哈里顿，是耐莉呀！耐莉，你的保姆。” \n 他向后退，使我没法碰到他，而且拣起一块大硬石头。 \n “我是来看你父亲的，哈里顿，”我又说，从这举动中猜出，即使耐莉还活在他的记忆里的话，他也不认识我就是耐莉了。 \n 他举起他的飞镖要掷。我开始说一套好话，可是不能止住他的手。那块石头掷中我的帽子，随之而来的是从这小家伙的口里吐出来一串结结巴巴的咒骂，也不知道他自己是否理解在骂些什么，但他这样出口骂人十分老练，还有一套恶狠狠的腔调。而且把他的娃娃面孔扭成一种令人吃惊的恶相。你会相信这模样使我生气，更使我痛苦。我都几乎要哭了。我又从口袋里拿出一只桔子，用它来向他讲和。他犹豫着，然后从我手里抢过去，好像他猜想我只是打算引诱他，再让他失望似的。我又拿一只给他看，却不让他拿到。 \n “谁教你说那些坏话的，我的孩子？”我问。“是副牧师吗？” \n “该死的副牧师，还有你！给我那个。”他回答。 \n “告诉我你在哪儿念书，你就可以拿到这个，”我说。“你的老师是谁？” \n “鬼爸爸，”这是他的回答。 \n “你跟爸爸学了什么呢？”我继续问。 \n 他跳起来要抢水果，我举得更高。“他教你什么？”我问。 \n “没教什么，”他说，“就叫我躲开他。爸爸才受不了我呢，因为我乱骂他。” \n “啊！鬼教你去乱骂爸爸啦？”我说。 \n “嗯——不是，”他慢腾腾地说。 \n “那么，是谁呢？” \n “希刺克厉夫。” \n 我问他喜欢不喜欢希刺克厉夫先生。 \n “嗯，”他又回答了。 \n 我想知道他喜欢他的理由，只听到这些话：“我不知道——爸爸怎么对付我，他就怎么对付爸爸——他骂爸爸因为爸爸骂我。他说我想干什么，就该去干。” \n “那么副牧师也不教你读书写字了吗？”我追问着。 \n “不教了，我听说副牧师要是跨进门槛的话，就要——把他的牙打进他的——喉咙里去——希刺克厉夫答应过的！” \n 我把桔子放在他的手里，叫他去告诉他父亲，有一个名叫丁耐莉的女人在花园门口等着要跟他说话。他顺着小路走去，进了屋子。但是，辛德雷没有来，希刺克厉夫却在门阶上出现了，我马上转身，拚命往大路跑去，一步也没停地直到我到了指路碑那儿，吓得我像是见了鬼一样。这事和伊莎贝拉小姐的事情并没多少关联，只是这促使我更加下决心严加提防，而且尽我最大的力量来制止这类恶劣的影响蔓延到田庄上来，即使我会因此惹得林惇夫人不痛快而引起一场家庭风波也不在乎。 \n 下一回希刺克厉夫来，我的小姐凑巧在院子里喂鸽子。她有三天没跟她嫂嫂说一句话了，可是她也不再怨天尤人了，这使我们深感宽慰。我知道，希刺克厉夫对林惇小姐向来没有献一下不必要的殷勤的习惯。现在，他一看见她，他的第一个警戒的动作却是对屋前面扫视一下。我正站在厨房窗前，可是我退后了不让他看见我，然后他穿过石路到她跟前，说了些什么。她仿佛很窘，直想走开。为了不让她走，他抓住她的胳膊。她把脸掉过去，显然他提出了一些她不想回答的问题。他又很快地溜一眼房屋，以为没人看见他，这流氓竟厚颜无耻地拥抱她了。 \n “犹大①背信的人！”我突然叫出声来。“而且你是个假冒为善的人，不是吗？一个存心欺人的骗子。” \n ①犹大——耶稣十二门徒之一，后来背信弃义将耶稣出卖给敌人，因此耶稣被钉在十字架上而死。 \n “是谁呀，耐莉？”在我的身旁发出了凯瑟琳的声音。我专心看外面这一对，竟没有注意她进来。 \n “你的不值一文的朋友！”我激动地回答，“就是那边那个鬼鬼祟祟的流氓。啊，他瞅见我们啦——他进来啦！既然他告诉过你他恨她，那么不知道他现在还有没有诡计找个巧妙的借口来解释他在向小姐求爱？” \n 林惇夫人看见伊莎贝拉把自己挣脱开，跑到花园里去了。一分钟以后，希刺克厉夫开了门。我忍不住要发泄一点我的愤怒，可是凯瑟琳生气地坚持不许我吭声，而且威吓我，说我如果敢于狂妄地出口不逊，她就要命令我离开厨房。 \n “人家要是听见你的话，还以为你是女主人哩！”她喊。 \n “你要安于你的本分，希刺克厉夫，你这是干吗，惹起这场乱子？我说过你千万不要惹伊莎贝拉！我求你不要，除非你已经不愿意在这里受到接待，而愿意林惇对你飨以闭门羹！” \n “上帝禁止他这样做！”这个恶棍回答。这当儿我恨透了他。“上帝会使他柔顺而有耐心的！我一天天越来越想把他送到天堂上去，想得都发狂了呢！” \n “嘘！”凯瑟琳说，关上里面的门。“不要惹我烦恼了。你为什么不顾我的请求呢？是她故意找你么？” \n “跟你有什么关系？”他怨声怨气地说。“如果她愿意的话，我就有权利吻她，而你没有权利反对。我不是你的丈夫，你用不着为了我而嫉妒！” \n “我不是为你嫉妒，”女主人回答，“我是出于对你的爱护。脸色开朗些，你不必对我皱眉头！如果你喜欢伊莎贝拉，你就娶她。可是你喜欢她么？说实话，希刺克厉夫！哪，你不肯回答。我就知道你不喜欢！” \n “而且林惇先生会同意他妹妹嫁给那个人吗？”我问。 \n “林惇先生会同意的，”我那夫人决断地回嘴。 \n “他不用给自己找这麻烦，”希刺克厉夫说，“没有他的批准，我也能照样作。至于你，凯瑟琳，现在，我们既然走到这步，我倒有心说几句话。我要你明白我是知道你曾经对待我很恶毒——很恶毒！你听见吗？如果你自以为我没有看出来，那你才是个傻子哩。如果你以为可以用甜言蜜语来安慰我，那你就是个白痴。如果你幻想我将忍受下去，不想报复，那就在最短期间，我就要使你信服，这恰恰相反！同时，谢谢你告诉我你的小姑的秘密，我发誓我要尽量利用它。你就靠边站吧？” \n “这又是他的性格里的什么新花样啊？”林惇夫人惊愕地叫起来。“我曾经对待你很恶毒——你要报复！你要怎样报复呢？忘恩负义的畜生？我对待你怎么恶毒啦？” \n “我并不要对你报复，”希刺克厉夫回答，火气稍减。“那不在计划之内。暴君压迫的奴隶，他们不反抗他；他们欺压他们下面的人。你为了使自己开心，而把我折磨到死，我甘心情愿；只是允许我以同样方式让我自己也开开心，而且也跟你同样地尽力避开侮辱。你既铲平了我的宫殿，就不要竖立一个茅草屋，而且满意地欣赏你的善举，认为你把这草屋作为一个家给了我。要是我以为你真的愿意我娶伊莎贝拉的话，我都可以割断我的喉咙” \n “啊，毛病在于我不嫉妒，是吧？”凯瑟琳喊叫着。“好吧，我可不再提这段亲事啦，那就跟把一个迷失的灵魂献给撒旦一样地糟。你的快乐，和魔鬼一样，就在于让人受苦。你证实了这点。埃德加在你才来时大发脾气，这才恢复，我也刚安稳平静下来。而你，一知道我们平静，你就不安，似乎有意惹起一场争吵。跟埃德加吵去吧，如果你愿意的话，希刺克厉夫，欺骗他妹妹吧！你正好找到报复我的最有效的方法。” \n 谈话停止了，林惇夫人坐在炉火房，两颊通红，郁郁不乐。她的这种情绪越来越在她身上摆脱不掉。她放不开，又驾驭不住。他交叉着双臂站在炉边，动着那些坏念头。就在这种情况下，我离开他们，去找主人，他正在奇怪什么事使凯瑟琳在楼下待了这么久。 \n “艾伦，”当我进去的时候，他说，“你看见你的女主人没有？” \n “看见了，她在厨房里，先生。”我回答。“她被希刺克厉夫先生的行动搞得很不高兴。实在，我认为今后该从另一种关系上考虑他进出我们家了。太随和是有害的，现在已经到了这个地步——”我就把院子里的一幕述说一番，而且尽我的胆量，把这之后的整个争执全说了。我还以为我的叙述对林惇夫人并不会很不利；除非她自己竟为她客人辩护起来，使之不利。埃德加·林惇很费劲地听我讲完。他开头的几句话表明他并不以为他妻子没有过错。 \n “这是不能容忍的！”他叫起来。“她把他当个朋友，而且强迫我和他来往，真是有失体统！给我从大厅叫两个人来，艾伦。凯瑟琳不能再留在那儿跟那下流的恶棍争论了——我已经太迁就她啦。” \n 他下了楼，吩咐仆人在过道里等着，便向厨房走去，我跟着他。厨房里的两个人又激怒地争论开了。至少，林惇夫人重新带劲地咒骂着。希刺克厉夫已经走到窗前，垂着头，显然多少被她那怒斥吓倒了。他先看见了主人，便赶忙作势叫她别说了，她一发现他的暗示的原因，便顿时服从了他。 \n “这是怎么回事？”林惇对她说，“那个下流人对你说了这番怪话之后，你还要待在这儿，你对于遵守礼节究竟有什么看法？我猜想，因为他平常就这样谈话，因此你觉得没什么，你习惯了他的下流，而且也许还以为我也能习惯吧！” \n “你是在门外听着的吗，埃德加？”女主人问，用的声调特意要惹她丈夫生气，表示自己满不在乎他的愤怒，显出鄙夷的神色，希刺克厉夫，开始在林惇说那番话时还抬眼看看，这时听到这句话就发出一声冷笑，似乎是故意要引起林惇先生的注意。他成功了。可是埃德加却无意对他发什么大脾气。 \n “我一直是容忍你的，先生。”他平静地说，“并不是我不晓得你那卑贱、堕落的性格，而是我觉得在那方面你也只应负部分的责任，而且凯瑟琳愿意和你来往，我默许了——很傻。你的到来是一种道德上的毒素，可以把最有德性的人都玷污了。为了这个缘故，而且为了防止更糟的后果，今后我不允许你到这家里来，现在就通知你，我要你马上离开。再耽搁三分钟，你的离开就要成为被迫的，而且是可耻的了。” \n 希刺克厉夫带着充满嘲笑的眼色从上到下地打量着说话的人。 \n “凯蒂，你这只羔羊吓唬起人来倒像只水牛哩！”他说， \n “他要是碰上我的拳头可有头骨破裂的危险。说实在的！林惇先生，我非常抱歉：一拳打倒你可不费事！” \n 我的主人向过道望了一眼，暗示我叫人来——他可没有冒险作单打的企图。我服从了这暗示。但是林惇夫人疑心有什么事，就跟过来，当我打算叫他们时，她把我拖回来，把门一关，上了锁。 \n “好公平的办法！”她说，这是对她丈夫愤怒惊奇的神色的回答。“如果你没有勇气打他，就道歉，要么就让你自己挨打。这可以改正你那种装得比原来更英勇的气派。不行，你要拿这钥匙，我就把它吞下去！我对你们俩的好心却得到这样愉快的报答！在不断地纵容这一位的软弱天性，和那一位的恶劣本性之后，到头来，我得到的报答却是两种盲目的忘恩负义，愚蠢得荒谬！他们真糊涂到近于荒唐的地步。埃德加，我一直在保护你和你所有的，现在但愿希刺克厉夫把你鞭笞得病倒，因为你竟敢把我想得这么坏！” \n 并不需要鞭笞，在主人身上就已经产生了挨打的效果。他试图从凯瑟琳手里夺来钥匙。为了安全起见，她把钥匙丢到炉火中烧得最炽热的地方去了。于是埃德加先生神经质地发着抖，他的脸变得死一样的苍白。他无论怎样也不能回避这种感情的泛滥，痛苦与耻辱混杂在一起，把他完全压倒了。他靠在一张椅背上，捂着脸。 \n “啊，天呀！在古时候，这会让你赢得骑士的封号哩！”林惇夫人喊着。“我们给打败啦！我们给打败啦！希刺克厉夫就要对你动手啦，就像一个国王把他的军队开去打一窝老鼠一样。打起精神来吧，你不会受伤的！你这样子不是一只绵羊，而是一只正在吃奶的小兔子！” \n “我祝你在这个乳臭小儿身上得到欢乐，凯蒂！”她的朋友说。“我为你的鉴赏力向你恭贺。你不要我而宁愿要的就是那流口水的，哆嗦着的东西！我不用我的拳头打他，我可要用我的脚踢他，那就会感到相当大的满足。他是在哭吗，还是他吓得要晕过去？” \n 这家伙走过去，把林惇靠着的椅子一推。他还不如站远些，因为我的主人很快地就站直了，结结实实地朝他喉头一击。这一击都可以把瘦弱一点的人打倒。这使希刺克厉夫有一分钟喘不过气来。在他噎住的当儿，林惇先生从后门走出，到院子里，从那儿又走到前面大门去了。 \n “哪！你是不能再来这儿啦。”凯瑟琳叫，“现在，走吧——他要带着一对手枪，半打帮手回来。如果他真的听见了我们的话，当然他永远也不会原谅你的。你刚才的行为对我大大不利，希刺克厉夫！可是，走吧——赶快！我宁可看见埃德加倒霉，也不愿看你倒霉。” \n “你以为我喉头挨了那火辣辣的一拳，就一走了事？”他大发雷霆。“我指着地狱发誓：绝不！在我跨出门坎之前，我要把他的肋骨捣碎得像颗烂棒子！如果我现在不揍他，我总有一天要杀死他。所以，既然你珍惜他的生命，就让我打他一顿吧！” \n “他不来了，”我插嘴说，撒了个谎。“有马夫和两个园丁在那儿，你当然不会等着被他们扔到路上去吧！他们个个都有根棍子。很可能，主人正站在客厅窗户前看他们执行他的命令。” \n 园丁和马夫是在那儿，可是林惇也跟他们在一起。他们已经走进院子来了。希刺克厉夫一转念，决定避免和这三位仆人打斗一场。他抓了把火钳，敲开里门的锁，在他们踏着大步进来时，他已逃掉了。 \n 林惇夫人非常激动，叫我陪她上楼。她不知道我对于这场乱子也有一份贡献，我也一心不让她知道。 \n “我快神经错乱啦，耐莉！”她嚷道，扑到沙发上。“一千个铁匠的锤子在我的头里敲打！告诉伊莎贝拉躲开我，这场风波是因她而起的；这时候若是她或者任何人再惹我生气，我就要发疯啦。而且，耐莉，如果你今天晚上再看见埃德加的话，跟他说我有得重病的危险——但愿真会这样。他把我吓一跳，使我难过极了！我也要吓唬他。而且，他也许会来，又要乱骂乱抱怨一阵。我肯定我一定会回嘴，天晓得我们到哪儿才算有个完！你愿意这样做吗，我的好耐莉？你晓得在这件事上不能怪我。是什么鬼附了他叫他偷听呢？你离开我们之后，希刺克厉夫的话很荒唐，可是我马上把他的话岔开，不提伊莎贝拉，其余的话并没有什么关系。现在，一切都闹糟了，就因为这傻子拚命想听人家说他的坏话，这种想法往往像魔鬼似地缠着人！如果埃德加根本没听到我们的话，他也绝不会搞得这样糟。真的，我为了他而骂希刺克厉夫，为了他骂得声嘶力竭之后，他却用那种不快的无理的口气向我开口，这时候我简直不在乎他们彼此怎样对待了。特别是，我觉得，无论这一场戏怎样结束，我们一定要被迫分开，没有人知道分开多久！好吧，如果我不能保留希刺克厉夫作我的朋友——如果埃德加卑鄙而嫉妒，我就要断肠心碎，好让他们也断肠心碎。当我被迫走上极端时，倒是结束这一切的迅速方法！但是为了一个可怜的希望，还是值得活下来——我不愿突然打击林惇。关于这一点，他一直很谨慎，唯恐把我惹急了。你一定要说明白我若放弃这个策略的危险性，而且提醒他我的暴躁脾气，只要一闹起来，就会发狂的。我愿你能消除你脸上现出的那种冷漠无情的神气，对我稍微表示点关心吧！” \n 我接受这些指示时所表现的泰然神气，无疑是令人冒火的。因为这些话确是说得十分诚恳的。但是我相信一个能够在事先就计划出怎样利用她的暴躁脾气的人，即使在爆发的时候，也可以行使她的意志，努力控制她自己；而且我也不愿如她所说去“吓唬”她的丈夫，只是为了满足她的自私而增加他的烦恼。因此当我遇见主人向客厅走来时，我也没说什么，我却径自转回，去听听他们是不是在一起重新开始争吵。 \n 他开始先说话了。 \n “你就待在那儿吧，凯瑟琳，”他说，他的声调毫无怒气，却充满着悲切、沮丧。“我不在这儿多待。我不是来争论的，也不是来求和的。可是我只想知道，经过了今晚的事情，你是否还打算继续你那亲密的关系跟那——” \n “啊，可怜可怜吧，”女主人打断了话，跺着脚，“可怜可怜吧，现在让我们别再提这事吧！你的冷血是不能发热的，你的血管里尽流着冰水。可是我的血在烧滚了。看见你这副冷冰冰的，不近人情的模样，我的血液都沸腾啦。” \n “要我走开，就回答我的问题，”林惇先生坚持说。“你必须回答，你那种狂暴并不能吓坏我。我发现，当你愿意的时候，你能够和任何人一样地冷静泰然。今后你要放弃希刺克厉夫呢，还是放弃我？你要同时作我的朋友，又作他的，那是不可能的；我绝对需要知道你选择哪一个。” \n “我需要你们都躲开我！”凯瑟琳狂怒地大叫。“我要求你们！你没有看见我站不住了么？埃德加，你——你躲开我！” \n 她拉铃，一直到把铃拉断了：我悠闲地走进来。这样失去理智、狂暴的脾气，连圣徒也会受不了的！她躺在那儿，用头直撞沙发扶手，而且咬牙切齿，你会以为她要把牙齿都咬碎呢！林惇先生刹那间感到既悔恨、又恐惧，站在那儿望着她，吩咐我去拿点水来。凯瑟琳说不出话来了。我端来满满一杯水，她不肯喝，我就把水泼到她脸上了。只几秒钟，她就挺直了身体，眼睛上翻，她的双颊顿时一阵白、一阵青，像是要死的神气。林惇看来吓坏了。 \n “根本没关系，”我低声说。我不希望他让步，尽管我自己心里也禁不住害怕。 \n “她嘴唇上有血！”他说，颤抖着。 \n “没关系！”我刻薄地回答。我就告诉他，她是怎样在他来之前就决定了要发一阵疯的。我没留意，嗓门提得太高了些。她听见了，因为她突然起来了——她的头发披散在肩上，眼睛闪闪的，脖子和胳膊上的青筋都反常地突出来。我下了决心准备至少断几根骨头，可是她只向周围瞪了一下，就冲出屋去。主人叫我跟着她，我就一直跟到她的卧房门口。她关紧了门，把我挡住了。 \n 第二天早上她既然没有说起要下楼吃早餐，我就去问她要不要我送点心上楼。“不！”她断然回答。午饭时，吃茶时，又是同一个问题。第二天早上又是一样，而且总是得到同样的回答。林惇先生呢，他在书房里消磨时光，也不问他妻子的事。伊莎贝拉和他有过一小时的碰面，在这次碰面中，他试图从她口中套出由于希刺克厉夫的进攻而使她产生的正常的恐惧之感；可是他从她躲躲闪闪的回答中听不出什么，只得不满意地结束了这场审问；然而加上了一个严肃的警告，就是，如果她真疯得竟对那个下贱的求婚者有所鼓励，那么她自己和他中间的一切关系就将全部解除。\n
