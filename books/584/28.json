{"id":18273,"no":28,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step approached--lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the room. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk bonnet on her head, and a willow basket swung to her arm. \\n\\n `Eh, dear! Mrs Dean!\u0027 she exclaimed. `Well! there is a talk about you at Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you\u0027d been found, and he\u0027d lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure? And how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs Dean? But you\u0027re not so thin--you\u0027ve not been so poorly, have you?\u0027 \\n\\n `Your master is a true scoundrel!\u0027 I replied. `But he shall answer for it. He needn\u0027t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!\u0027 \\n\\n `What do you mean?\u0027 asked zillah. `It\u0027s not his tale: they tell that in the village--about your being lost in the marsh: and I calls to Earnshaw, when I come in--\"Eh, they\u0027s queer things, Mr Hareton, happened since I went off. It\u0027s a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly Dean.\u0027\u0027 He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I told him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to himself, and said, ``If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can tell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog water got into her head, and she would have run home quite flighty; but I fixed her till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire\u0027s funeral.\"\u0027 \\n\\n `Mr Edgar is not dead?\u0027 I gasped. `Oh! Zillah, Zillah!\u0027 \\n\\n `No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,\u0027 she replied, `you\u0027re right sickly yet. He\u0027s not dead: Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another day. I met him on the road and asked.\u0027 \\n\\n Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened below, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for someone to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle, sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes. `Where is Miss Catherine?\u0027 I demanded sternly, supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him thus, alone. He sucked on like an innocent. \\n\\n `Is she gone?\u0027 I said. \\n\\n `No,\u0027 he replied; `she\u0027s upstairs: she\u0027s not to go; we won\u0027t let her.\u0027 \\n\\n `You won\u0027t let her, little idiot!\u0027 I exclaimed. `Direct me to her room immediately, or I\u0027ll make you sing out sharply.\u0027 \\n\\n `Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,\u0027 he answered. `He says I\u0027m not to be soft with Catherine: she\u0027s my wife, and it\u0027s shameful that she should wish to leave me. He says, she hates me and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan\u0027t have it: and she shan\u0027t go home! She never shall!--she may cry, and be sick as much as she pleases!\u0027 \\n\\n He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to drop asleep. \\n\\n `Master Heathcliff,\u0027 I resumed, `have you forgotten all Catherine\u0027s kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through wind and snow to see you? She wept to miss one evening, because you would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though you know he detests you both. And you join him against her. That\u0027s fine gratitude, is it not?\u0027 \\n\\n The corner of Linton\u0027s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his lips. \\n\\n `Did she come to Wuthering Heights, because she hated you?\u0027 I continued. `Think for yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you will have any. And you say she\u0027s sick; and yet, you leave her alone, up there in a strange house! You who have felt what it is to be so neglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them too; but you won\u0027t pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see--an elderly woman, and a servant merely--and you, after pretending such affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every tear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you\u0027re a heartless, selfish boy!\u0027 \\n\\n `I can\u0027t stay with her,\u0027 he answered crossly. `I\u0027ll not stay by myself. She cries so I can\u0027t bear it. And she won\u0027t give over, though I say I\u0027ll call my father. I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle her, if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the room, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that I couldn\u0027t sleep.\u0027 \\n\\n `Is Mr Heathcliff out?\u0027 I inquired, perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathize with his cousin\u0027s mental tortures. \\n\\n `He\u0027s in the court,\u0027 he replied, `talking to Dr Kenneth; who says uncle is dying, truly, at last. I\u0027m glad, for I shall be master of the Grange after him--and Catherine always spoke of it as her house. It isn\u0027t hers! It\u0027s mine: papa says everything she has is mine. All her nice books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out; but I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine. And then she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I should have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother, and on the other, uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday--I said they were mine, too; and tried to get them from her. The spiteful thing wouldn\u0027t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked out--that frightens her--she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges and divided the case, and gave me her mother\u0027s portrait; the other she attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained it. He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me; she refused, and he--he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain, and crushed it with his foot.\u0027 \\n\\n `And were you pleased to see her struck?\u0027 I asked: having my designs in encouraging his talk. \\n\\n `I winked,\u0027 he answered: `I wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse, he does it so hard. Yet I was glad at first--she deserved punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her teeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can\u0027t speak for pain. I don\u0027t like to think so; but she\u0027s a naughty thing for crying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I\u0027m afraid of her.\u0027 \\n\\n `And you can get the key if you choose?\u0027 I said. \\n\\n `Yes, when I\u0027m upstairs,\u0027 he answered; `but I can\u0027t walk upstairs now. \\n\\n `In what apartment is it?\u0027 I asked. \\n\\n `Oh,\u0027 he cried, `I shan\u0027t tell you where it is! It is our secret. Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you\u0027ve tired me--go away, go away!\u0027 And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut his eyes again. \\n\\n I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr Heathcliff, and bring a rescue for my young lady from the Grange. On reaching it, the astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr Edgar\u0027s door: but I bespoke the announcement of it, myself. How changed I found him, even in those few days! He lay an image of sadness and resignation waiting his death. Very young he looked; though his actual age was thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least. He thought of Catherine; for he murmured her name. I touched his hand, and spoke. \\n\\n `Catherine is coming, dear master!\u0027 I whispered; `she is alive and well; and will be here, I hope, tonight.\u0027 \\n\\n I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up, looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at the Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite true. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe all his father\u0027s brutal conduct--my intentions being to add no bitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup. \\n\\n He divined that one of his enemy\u0027s purposes was to secure the personal property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together. However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leaving Catherine\u0027s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall to Mr Heathcliff should Linton die. \\n\\n Having received his orders, I dispatched a man to fetch the attorney, and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of her jailer. Both parties were delayed very late. The single servant returned first. He said Mr Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then Mr Green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning. The four men came back unaccompanied also. They brought word that Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. Her father shall see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to prevent it! \\n\\n Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone downstairs at three o\u0027clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump. `Oh! it is Green,\u0027 I said, recollecting myself--`only Green,\u0027 and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. The harvest moon shone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck, sobbing: \\n\\n `Ellen! Ellen! is papa alive?\u0027 \\n\\n `Yes,\u0027 I cried: `yes, my angel, he is. God be thanked, you are safe with us again!\u0027 \\n\\n She wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr Linton\u0027s room; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink, and washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron. Then I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say, she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me she would not complain. \\n\\n I couldn\u0027t abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the chamber door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed, then. All was composed, however: Catherine\u0027s despair was as silent as her father\u0027s joy. She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed on her features his raised eyes, that seemed dilating with ecstasy. \\n\\n He died blissfully, Mr Lockwood: he died so. Kissing her cheek, he murmured. \\n\\n `I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to us!\u0027 and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant gaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None could have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely without a struggle. \\n\\n Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. It was well I succeeded in removing her; for at dinner time appeared the lawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how to behave. He had sold himself to Mr Heathcliff, and that was the cause of his delay in obeying my master\u0027s summons. Fortunately, no thought of worldly affairs crossed the latter\u0027s mind, to disturb him, after his daughter\u0027s arrival. \\n\\n Mr Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place. He gave all the servants, but me, notice to quit. He would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with his family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to stay at the Grange till her father\u0027s corpse had quitted it. \\n\\n She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk of liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and she gathered the sense of Heathcliff\u0027s answer. It drove her desperate. Linton, who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father re-ascended. He had the cunning to unlock and relock the door, without shutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his petition was granted for once. Catherine stole out before break of day. She dare not try the doors, lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother\u0027s, she got easily out of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir tree close by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape, notwithstanding his timid contrivances.\\n\\n “呃，啊呀！丁太太！”她叫。“好呀，在吉默吞有人谈论着你们啦。我从来没想到你会陷在黑马沼里，还有小姐跟你在一起，后来主人告诉我已经找到你们了，他让你们住在这儿了！怎么！你们一定是爬上一个岛了吧？你们在山洞里多久？是主人救了你吗，丁太太？可你不怎么瘦--你没有怎么受罪吧，是吗？” \\n\\n “你主人是个真正的无赖汉！”我回答。“可是他要负责任的。他用不着编瞎话：总要真相大白的！” \\n\\n “你是什么意思？”齐拉问。“那不是他编的话：村里人都那么说--都说你们在沼地里迷失了；当我进来时，我就问起恩萧--‘呃，哈里顿先生，自从我走后有怪事发生啦。那个漂亮的小姑娘怪可惜的，还有丁耐莉也完了，’他瞪起眼来了。我以为他还没有听到，所以我就把这流言告诉他。主人听着，他自己微笑着还说，‘即使她们先前掉在沼地里，她们现在可是出来啦，齐拉。丁耐莉这会儿就住在你房间里，你上楼时可以叫她快走吧；钥匙在这里。泥水进了她的头，她神经错乱地要往家里跑；可是我留住了她，等她神志清醒过来。如果她能走，你叫她马上去田庄吧，给我捎个信去，说她的小姐跟着就来，可以赶得上送殡。” \\n\\n “埃德加先生没死吧？”我喘息着。“啊，齐拉，齐拉！” \\n\\n “没有，没有；你坐下吧，我的好太太，”她回答，“你还是病着呢。他没死。肯尼兹医生认为他还可以活一天。我在路上遇见他时问过了的。” \\n\\n 我没有坐下来，我抓起我的帽子，赶忙下楼，因为路是自由开放了。一进大厅，我四下里望着想找个人告诉我关于凯瑟琳的消息。这地方充满了阳光，门大开着；可是眼前就看不见一个人。我正犹豫着不知是马上走好呢，还是回转去找我的女主人，忽然一声轻微的咳嗽把我的注意力引到炉边。林惇躺在躺椅上，一个人待着，吮一根棒糖，以冷漠无情的眼光望着我的动作。“凯瑟琳小姐在哪儿？”我严厉地问他，以为我既然正好撞见他一个人待在那儿，就可以吓唬他好给点情报。他却像个呆子似的继续吮糖。 \\n\\n “她走了吗？”我说。 \\n\\n “没有，”他回答，“她在楼上。她走不了；我们不让她走。” \\n\\n “你们不让她走，小白痴！”我叫，“马上带我到她屋里去，不然我要让你叫出声来。” \\n\\n “要是你打算到那里去，爸爸还要让你叫出声来呢，”他回答。“他说我不必温和地对待凯瑟琳。她是我的妻子，她要离开我就是可耻的。他说她恨我并且愿意我死，她好得到我的钱；可是她拿不到：她回不了家！她永远不会！--她可以哭呀，生病呀，随她的便！” \\n\\n 他又继续吮着糖，闭着眼，好像他想瞌睡了。 \\n\\n “希刺克厉夫少爷，”我又开始说，“你忘了去年冬天凯瑟琳对你的所有的恩情了吗？那时候你肯定说你爱她，那时候她给你带书来，给你唱歌，而且有多少次冒着风雪来看你？有一天晚上她不能来，她就哭，唯恐你会失望；那时候你觉得她比你好几百倍：现在你却相信你父亲告诉你的谎话了，虽然你明知他憎恨你们两个人，你却和他联在一起反对她。可真是好样儿的感恩报德，是不是？” \\n\\n 林惇的嘴角撇下来，他把棒糖从嘴里抽出来。 \\n\\n “她到呼啸山庄来是因为她恨你吗？”我接着说。“你自己想想吧；至于你的钱，她甚至还不知道你会有什么钱。而你说她病了；可你还丢下她一个人，在一个陌生人家的楼上！你也受过这样被人忽视的滋味呀，你能怜悯你自己的痛苦；她也怜悯你的痛苦；可是你就不能怜悯她的痛苦！我都掉眼泪了，希刺克厉夫少爷，你瞧--我，一个年纪比较大点的女人，而且不过是个仆人--你呢，在假装出那么多温情，而且几乎有了爱她的理由之后，却把每一滴眼泪存下来为你自己用，还挺安逸地躺在那里。啊，你是个没良心的，自私的孩子！” \\n\\n “我不能跟她待在一起，”他烦躁地回答。“我又不愿意一个人守在那里。她哭得我受不了。虽然我说我要叫我父亲啦，她也还是没完没了。我真叫过他一次，他吓唬她，要是她还不安静下来，他就要勒死她；可是他一离开那屋，她又哭开了，虽然我烦得大叫因为我睡不着，她还是整夜的哭哭啼啼。” \\n\\n “希刺克厉夫先生出去了吗？”我看出来这个下贱的东西没有力量来同情他表姐的心灵上所受到的折磨，便盘问着。 \\n\\n “他在院子里，”他回答，“跟肯尼兹医生说话哩；医生说舅舅终于真的要死了。我很高兴，因为我要继承他，作田庄的主人了。凯瑟琳一说起那儿总把它当作是她的房子。那不是她的！那是我的。爸爸说她所有的每一样东西都是我的。她所有的好书是我的，她说如果我肯拿给她我们房子的钥匙，放她出去，她情愿把那些书给我，还有她那些漂亮的鸟，还有她的小马敏妮；但是我告诉她，她并没有东西可给，那些全是，全是我的。后来她就哭啦；又从她脖子上拿下一张小相片，说我可以拿那个；那是两张放在一个金盒子里的相片，一面是她母亲，另一面是她父亲，都是在他们年轻的时候照的。那是昨天发生的事。我说那也是我的，想从她手里夺过来。那个可恶的东西不让我拿：她把我推开，把我弄痛了。我就大叫--那使她害怕了--她听见爸爸来了，她拉断铰链，打开盒子，把她母亲的相片给我；那一张她打算藏起来，可是爸爸问怎么回事，我就说出来了。他把我得到的相片拿去了，又叫她把她的给我；她拒绝了，他就--他就把她打倒在地，从项链上把那盒子扯下来，用他的脚踏烂。” \\n\\n “你喜欢看她挨打吗？”我问，有意鼓励他说话。 \\n\\n “我闭上眼睛，”他回答，“我看见我父亲打狗或打马，我都闭上眼睛，他打得真狠。但是一开头我是挺喜欢的--她既推我，就活该受罪。可是等到爸爸走了，她叫我到窗子前面，给我看她的口腔被牙齿撞破了，她满口是血；然后她把相片的碎片都收集起来，走开了，脸对着墙坐着，从此她就再也没跟我说过话：我有时候以为她是痛得不能说话。我不愿意这样想！可是她不停地哭，真是个顽劣的家伙；而且她看来是这么苍白，疯疯癫癫的样子，我都怕她啦。” \\n\\n “要是你愿意的话，你能拿到钥匙吧？”我说。 \\n\\n “能，只要我在楼上，”他回答，“可是我现在不能走上楼。” \\n\\n “在哪间屋子？”我问。 \\n\\n “啊，”他叫，“我才不会告诉你在哪儿。那是我们的秘密。没有人知道，哈里顿或齐拉也不知道。啊呀！你把我搞累了--走开，走开！”他把脸转过去，靠在他的胳臂上，又闭上了双眼。 \\n\\n 我考虑最好不用看到希刺克厉夫先生就走，再从田庄带人来救我的小姐。一到家，我的伙伴们看见我，都是惊喜非常的，他们一听到他们的小女主人平安，有两三个人就要赶忙到埃德加先生的房门口前大声呼喊这个消息；但我愿自己通报。才几天的工夫，我发现他变得多么厉害呀！他带着悲哀的，听天由命的神气躺着等死。他看来很年轻：虽然他实际年龄是三十九岁。至少，人家会把他当作年轻十岁看。他想着凯瑟琳，因为他在喃喃地叫着她的名字。我摸着他的手说： \\n\\n “凯瑟琳就来了，亲爱的主人！”我低声说，“她活着，而且挺好；就要来了；我希望，今天晚上。” \\n\\n 这消息引起的最初效果使我颤抖起来：他撑起半身，热切地向这屋子四下望着，跟着就晕过去了。等他恢复过来，我就把我们的被迫进门，以及在山庄的被扣留都说了。我说希刺克厉夫强迫我进去；那是不大真实的。我尽可能少说反对林惇的话；我也没把他父亲的禽兽行为全描述出来--我的用意是，只要我能够，就不想在他那已经溢满的苦杯中再增添苦味了。 \\n\\n 他推测他的敌人目的之一就是取得他私人的财产以及田地，好给他的儿子；或者宁可说给他自己；但使我主人疑惑不解的是他为什么不能等自己死后再动手，而不知道他外甥将要差不多和他一同离开人世了。无论如何，他觉得他的遗嘱最好改一下：不必把凯瑟琳的财产由她自己支配了，他决定把这财产交到委托人手里，供她生前使用，如果她有孩子，在她死后给她孩子用。依靠这方法，即使林惇死了，财产也不会落到希刺克厉夫先生手里了。 \\n\\n 我接受了他的吩咐后，就派一个人去请律师，又派了四个人，配备了可用的武器，去把我的小姐从她的狱卒那儿要回来。两批人都耽搁得很晚才回来。单人出去的仆人先回来。他说当他到律师格林先生家的时候，格林先生不在家，他不得不等了两个钟头，律师才回来。然后格林先生告诉他说他在村里有点小事要办；但他在早晨以前一定可以赶到画眉田庄。那四个人也没陪着小姐回来。他们捎回口信说凯瑟琳病了--病得离不开她的屋子，希刺克厉夫不许他们去见她。我痛痛快快骂这些笨家伙一顿，因为他们听信了那套瞎话，我不把这话传给主人，决定天亮带一群人上山庄去，认真地大闹一番，除非他们把被监禁的人稳稳地交到我们手里。他父亲一定要见到她，我发誓，又发誓，如果那个魔鬼想阻止这个，即使让他死在他自己的门阶前也成！ \\n\\n 幸好，我省去了这趟出行和麻烦。我在三点钟下楼去拿一罐水，正在提着水罐走过大厅时，这时前门一阵猛敲使我吓一跳。“啊，那是格林，”我说，镇定着自己--“就是格林，”我仍然向前走，打算叫别人来开门；可是门又敲起来：声音不大，仍然很急促。我把水罐放在栏杆上，连忙自己开门让他进来。中秋的满月在外面照得很亮。那不是律师。我自己的可爱的小女主人跳过来搂着我的脖子哭泣着：“艾伦，艾伦！爸爸还活着吧？” \\n\\n “是的，”我叫着，“是的，我的天使，他还活着，谢谢上帝，你平平安安地又跟我们在一起啦！” \\n\\n 她已经喘不过气来，却想跑上楼到林惇先生的屋子里去；但是我强迫她坐在椅子上，叫她喝点水，又洗洗她那苍白的脸，用我的围裙把她的脸擦得微微泛红。然后我说我必须先去说一声她来了，又求她对林惇先生说，她和小希刺克厉夫在一起会很幸福的。她愣住了，可是马上就明白我为什么劝她说假话，她向我保证她不会诉苦的。 \\n\\n 我不忍待在那儿看他们见面。我在卧房门外站了一刻钟，简直不敢走近床前。但是，一切都很安宁：凯瑟琳的绝望如同她父亲的欢乐一样不露声色，表面上，她镇静地扶着他；他抬起他那像是因狂喜而张大的眼睛盯住她的脸。 \\n\\n 他死得有福气，洛克乌德先生，他是这样死的：他亲亲她的脸，低声说：“我去她那儿了；你，宝贝孩子，将来也要到我们那儿去的！”就再也没动，也没说话；但那狂喜的明亮的凝视一直延续着，直到他的脉搏不知不觉地停止，他的灵魂离开了。没有人能注意到他去世的准确时刻，那是完全没有一点挣扎就死去了。 \\n\\n 也许凯瑟琳把她的眼泪耗尽了，也许悲哀太沉重，以致哭不出来，她就这么眼中无泪地坐在那里直到日出：她坐到中午，还要待在那儿对着灵床呆想，但是我坚持要她走开，休息一下。好的是我把她劝开了，因为午饭时律师来了，他已经到过呼啸山庄，取得了如何处理的指示。他把自己卖给希刺克厉夫先生了：这就是他在我主人召唤以后迟迟不来的缘故，幸亏，在他女儿来到之后，他就根本没有想到过那些尘世间的种种事务。 \\n\\n 格林先生自行负起责任安排一切事情以及安排这地方的每一个人。他把所有的仆人，除了我，都辞退了。他还要执行他的委托权，坚持埃德加·林惇不能葬在他妻子旁边，却要葬在教堂里，跟他的家族在一起。无论如何，遗嘱阻止那样行事，我也高声抗议，反对任何违反遗嘱指示的行为。丧事匆匆地办完了。凯瑟琳，如今的林惇·希刺克厉夫夫人，被准许住在田庄，直到她父亲起灵为止。 \\n\\n 她告诉我说她的痛苦终于刺激了林惇，他冒险放走了她。她听见我派去的人在门口争论，她听出了希刺克厉夫的回答中的意思。那使她不顾死活了。林惇在我走后就被搬到楼上小客厅里去，他被吓得趁他父亲还没有再上楼，就拿到了钥匙。他很机灵地把门开开锁又重新上了锁，可没把它关严；当他该上床时，他要求跟哈里顿睡，他的请求这一回算是被批准了。凯瑟琳在天亮前偷偷出去。她不敢开门，生怕那些狗要引起骚扰；她到那些空的房间，检查那里的窗子；很幸运，她走到她母亲的房间，她从那里的窗台上很容易出来了，利用靠近的枞树，溜到地上。她的同谋者，尽管想出了他那怯懦的策略，为了这件逃脱的事还是吃了苦头。\\n\\n
