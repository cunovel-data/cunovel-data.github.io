{"id":109623,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"He moaned and it made her pull harder. Her skin was on fire, her body throbbing to the rhythm of each hard suckle, forcing her hips to match until they both shivered.\n He cupped the back of her head, holding her against his throat, luxuriating in the feel of her thick tresses. No female had ever scored him, taken his jugular like this. His hands spread over her delicate back, holding her closer, wanting to pull her inside him. The paper she held torched in cold, blue flames. She dropped the amulet to the ground as their minds touched.\n \"You should be a second,\" he said on a ragged breath, when she lifted her head. \"If it\u0027s just you and I left to rebuild, youhave to know certain things.\"\n \"Carlos, the numbers-\"\n \"I\u0027ve got \u0027em.\" Ash fell from her unburned hand. He took her hand and kissed the center of it. \"You never commit important things to paper. They can be discovered,\" he said. \"His mother didn\u0027t have much to leave him after the government did their thing. Besides, I have an account number.\" He tapped his temple with one finger.\n \"He wouldn\u0027t want you to steal from-\"\n \"What? Other drug dealers, Mafia, the government?\" He dragged his fang along the edge of her shoulder and swept it up her throat. \"Let me show you how it\u0027s done.\"\n His arms encircled her, one palm flattening against her back, the other against the swell of her buttocks. The strike was so swift that it made colors dance beneath her lids. Knowledge, power, and desire filled her, arching her back, her nails digging into his shoulders.\n Her cry fractured the night, and instinct clawed its way up and out of her. She bit him so hard they both stumbled backward. It was all building inside her, almost a painful, overwhelming tide. All she had to do was release her resistance and say yes.\n \"Be mine,\" he whispered. \"Share my strength, fight with me, side by side as a mate.\"\n Conflict tore at her. She couldn\u0027t answer him, nor could she pull away.\n \"Baby, all you have to do is stop fighting the inevitable.\"\n A slow shudder started in the pit of her womb, and it climbed up her abdomen, ripped through her torso, and entered her lungs. He siphoned it up through her veins, into her throat until tears wet her eyes, the shudder becoming his name in her mind as the orgasm crested. \"Yolando!\"\n His knees buckled and he caught her and took them both to the ground. She\u0027d called him by name. The sound of her voice reverberated through him, a dark echo. He held her in a firm grip, her legs wrapped around him, his hand cupped beneath her head, keeping it from touching the ground. Her long, dark hair spilled across the grass and into a section of the white prayer line. Light danced along the strands of her hair, making it glow. Heat rose and warmed his face. But it wasn\u0027t comparable to the heat she\u0027d stoked in him.\n She began to cry. He could literally feel the depth of love that she had for the man who\u0027d built her this sanctuary. It flowed through her veins, poisoned her tears with the agony of her decision. Her commitment was so deep for this human that he could almost feel it connected to her soul, actually giving her one of those, its pure essence oozing through her skin into his and coating him with a desire beyond raw lust that he\u0027d never known.\n The conflict broke through the steel cage of his conscience; as much as he wanted her at the moment, he didn\u0027t want her like this. Vampiric instinct compelled him to simply take her throat; willing or not, she had no defense. Everything vampire within him knew that the pleasure he could give her, even while she wept for the human, would be incomparable to anything she\u0027d ever experienced before. But he also knew that she\u0027d never forgive him... eternity was a long time. With Tara he could do forever, as long as she was his in her heart. Right now, she wasn\u0027t. She didn\u0027t want this to happen, even though her body did.\n Yonnie forced himself up, bracing his weight on his arm as he stared down at her. He\u0027d vowed that he\u0027d never violate a woman against her will; he\u0027d seen his own mother raped and destroyed by men as she tried to hold onto her dignity while her pride was stripped naked on a plantation-barn floor.\n \"Has he been faithful to you?\" Yonnie asked her, the frustration making his arm around Tara\u0027s waist tremble.Please, baby, I know what he\u0027s done to you. Carlos transferred everything in our line to me! Every tear you\u0027ve cried, I know of, because you\u0027re in my line -we share the connection. Talk to me.\n When she only sobbed harder, he pulled out of the intoxicating mind lock with her. She had to say it, tell him it was all right to love her like they both needed it now. The words had to come out of her own mouth. No illusions, no games, no trickery involved. He wanted her straight. Her heart his. No forgery to accept at this point. He kissed her temple. \"While he\u0027s on the road, rolling with the band, moving country to country, has he ever taken another knowing he had you... an incredible, gorgeous woman waiting for him?\" He kissed her throat, scored it, and drew his mouth away, pure fury lacerating him as she clutched her misplaced loyalty. \"When he was in Brazil, didn\u0027t he take another woman to bed who looked like you?\"\n The desire to violate her and satisfy himself battled with his urge to just drop her on the grass and leave her. This human, the Guardian named Rider, didn\u0027t deserve her. How could a man simply walk away from a woman like this? \"Why didn\u0027t you just turn him? Make him like you, so you could be with him forever, since you can\u0027t seem to leave him? I don\u0027t understand. Then you allow him to dog you... why? You don\u0027t have to exist like this.\"\n His questions only made her cry a new torrent of tears. His voice was hoarse as he nuzzled her temple. \"Baby, why do you allow him to do that to you? Hold his ass accountable,\" Yonnie said, his voice tender but firm. He kissed her temple hard, unable to draw himself away. \"I\u0027ll take care of you, baby... I\u0027ll give you whatever you want, whatever you need. Just be with me.\"\n \"He\u0027s done so much for me,\" she whispered. \"I can\u0027t leave Rider.\"\n Yonnie dropped her and stood.\n \"Has he?\" Yonnie stared at the cabin. \"A house is the least you deserved. Has he sacrificed for you, the way you have for him?\" He stared at her hard. She sat up, wiped her face, avoiding his gaze.\n \"But you sacrificed for him.\" Yonnie waited. \"Too much, I think. Even human blood.\"\n \"That\u0027s different,\" she said, still not looking at him.\n \"How? He\u0027s even made you close yourself off from real pleasure. Has you living like a nun.\" Yonnie spat out the remnants of her blood on the ground and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"You\u0027ve even accepted not cuming. He can\u0027t take a bite or deliver one to release you-and you died in your damned prime!\" He rubbed his palms down his face, so thoroughly outraged at the concept that he could barely stabilize his breathing. \"You\u0027re emotionally and physically starved,\" he said, his glare becoming tender as tears ran down her cheeks. \"And you make excuses for him because he\u0027s human... yet, whenever the urge hits him, he can go for a drink, watch the girls dance the poles, jack off if he has to or take one of them to bed. And you choose to live like that?\"\n \"He\u0027s human, and it\u0027s different-\"\n \"How? In what way? Don\u0027t you have needs? Only his matters because of a cabin? When you met him, you saved his life as much as he saved yours. Fair exchange. Your debt was paid. What do you owe him now, Tara? You think you\u0027re not worthy of loving on your own merit alone? Ask yourself: Did he give up his friends, interacting with his own kind, screwing his own kind, anything that makes his life easier to live?\"\n When she didn\u0027t answer him he stared at her until their eyes met. \"You gave up everything for him.Everything . After more than twenty years of existing like this, don\u0027t you deserve to do more than survive?\"\n She only swallowed hard and turned her face away from his. Humiliation and defeat caused her shoulders to hunch. Yonnie came to her, knelt, and touched her face. He wanted to claim her. Not as a trophy but as a part of him. He\u0027d never experienced the kind of love she had for this Rider, and if she could ever give a fraction of that to him, his lonely existence would be worth it. Her struggle to remain faithful to a human who hadn\u0027t plundered him.\n \"I envy him,\" Yonnie whispered. \"You tell that bastard that if he ever messes up, you\u0027ve got someone waiting to give you the world. I can wait. I\u0027ve got time on my side.\" Yonnie drew his hand away from her face. \"Make sure you also tell him that the only thin thread standing between you and me is your decision, and the fact that my boy Carlos doesn\u0027t need dissention in his ranks while he\u0027s rebuilding right now.\"\n He stood, turned, and began to walk away.\n She scrambled to her feet. A mild current of panic washed through her. \"Where are you going?\"\n He stopped but didn\u0027t turn around. He couldn\u0027t bear to be alone with her another minute, any more than he had it in him to tell her about the coven brothel that was his destination. It was Halloween, and there were willing witches that he could use to purge her from his mind-for the night, at least. He glanced at Tara over his shoulder.\n \"I\u0027m going to see what the witches can divine for me,\" he muttered, walking farther away from her. Why he\u0027d felt it necessary to cover his whereabouts truly disturbed him.\n \"Where?\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n \"But if you get trapped out there, alone,\" she said quickly, the urgency in her voice making him shudder and know she cared.\n \"Go in the house!\" he yelled, pointing at the front door without looking at her. The sweet sound of her voice was making him crazy. The melody of it laced with concern rippled through him. \"Don\u0027t argue with me. You\u0027ve made your decision and I\u0027ll take care of me.\"\n She didn\u0027t move, and he turned to look at her, eyes blazing solid red.\n \"I said,\" he repeated, more gently, \"go in the house. I\u0027ll be back before dawn.\"\n \"Be careful,\" she murmured, backing into the barrier light.\n There was nothing to discuss. The team gathered up the remaining weapons. Carlos took up a position by himself in the rear of the cabin, while others fanned out strategically in seats throughout. That suited him just fine. He needed space to think and to nurse his wounded jaw and pride.\n They had been rerouted just before midnight, so their flight never touched down in Dubai as originally planned. He thought about the attack and knew he was missing something. Numbers kept jumping into his mind for some reason. So did locations. Strategy and figuring out connections had always been his strong suit, living or dead. He toyed with the logistics, knowing there was a clue within them, becoming agitated that his loss of additional insight and powers of discernment that he would have had if he were still a vampire, blinded him to the root cause of the attack. Daybreak couldn\u0027t come fast enough for him, especially now that they were over land. Once they\u0027d neared the Red Sea, all Hell had broken loose on their thirteen-hour flight. There was a connection; thirteen had to be a bad number; he could feel it in his bones.\n He glanced up and saw Rider stand up and noted the time. Four A.M. In an hour they\u0027d touch down. It would be dawn. If they could just get to the ground in Addis Ababa without any more drama, that would be enough for him. He leaned his head back and closed his eyes. He was too exhausted to fight.\n All of a sudden, he felt a presence standing over him and he opened his eyes.\n \"Can we talk?\" Rider said, looking down at Carlos.\n Carlos shrugged. \"Yeah, whatever.\"\n Rider sat down next to him. \"I\u0027m sorry about the jaw.\"\n \"It\u0027s cool,\" Carlos said, and stared out the window.\n Rider held out his hand to Carlos.\n Carlos turned his head, looked at Rider, then at his outstretched hand. After a few long seconds, he accepted the handshake. His pride still stung. A forty-five-year-old guy had flattened him.\n \"Listen,\" Rider said carefully, when he went back to talking to Carlos\u0027s profile. \"We\u0027re all a little touchy right now. Everybody\u0027s senses are off, except maybe Marlene\u0027s. So we may not be making the best decisions.\" He rubbed his jaw. \"I know while you were a vamp, you had to do what you had to do to survive,\" Rider finally said through a weary sigh.\n \"Yeah, I did,\" Carlos muttered. \"You have no idea what kinda shit I had to contend with, man. Having people who could watch my back was imperative.\"\n Rider nodded. \"Your boy, Yonnie, is cool... he\u0027ll honor your marks?\"\n \"Yeah. He\u0027s cool, man,\" Carlos said, looking at Rider for the first time.\n He saw real fear in Rider\u0027s eyes.\n \"Look, man,\" Rider said. \"I\u0027ve done a lot of shit that I\u0027m sure she knows about, and, by rights, she could...\" He glanced away, finding that same vacant space on the horizon that Carlos had been staring at. \"We\u0027ve been together a long time, dude, and she means the world to me.\"\n Carlos nodded. \"He won\u0027t hurt her. I never rolled like that and neither does he.\"\n Rider looked Carlos in the eyes. \"That\u0027s not what I was worried about, dude.\"\n For a moment, neither man said a word.\n \"I\u0027m forty-five, and I\u0027m the only one she\u0027s even... you know what I\u0027m saying?\"\n Carlos nodded, this time understanding fully. Wasn\u0027t he plagued by the same fear? That Damali might stay with him because she just didn\u0027t know what else the world had to offer her yet. The word \"yet\" burned in his mind.\n The older Guardian drew a shaky breath and let it out slowly.\n \"If you made him, dude, he\u0027s strong,\" Rider said quietly. \"But him being a good guy is what could get under her skin.\" Rider\u0027s voice became distant as he spoke, telling Carlos what haunted his soul in halting sentences. \"And he\u0027s in my house with my woman who I see maybe once a year.\" Rider shook his head. \"My baby\u0027s never taken a throat nick from a master, done a mind lock, or...\" His voice trailed off. \"I\u0027m human. I\u0027m getting older. I\u0027m not what I used to be when we met.\"\n \"She loves you, man. She\u0027ll be cool,\" Carlos said quietly, becoming lost in his own thoughts. His statement was as much for his Guardian brother as it was for himself.\n \"The two of them together, on the run,\" Rider said softly. \"Relying on each other to survive, under siege. You know what kind of bond that forms.\" He chuckled sadly and closed his eyes, leaning back in the seat. \"Been there. That\u0027s how I met her.\"\n Carlos glanced down at his knees. \"Yeah.\"\n \"But it\u0027s even more than that. They\u0027re both vampires, first. I\u0027m just a human on the outside looking in.\"\n Carlos rubbed his face with both palms. What else was there to say? That Rider was wrong? That there was nothing to worry about? That Tara wouldn\u0027t leave him? He\u0027d been there, too. Teetering on the edge, the not knowing how it would all work out kicking his ass. He had met Damali the same way, while she was on the run so many years ago, and what they had even death couldn\u0027t stop.\n Compassion filled him. The irony was severe.\n Carlos closed his eyes and mind against the painful possibilities. \"I know, man. I know.\"\n For what felt like a long time, Carlos and Rider sat quietly side-by-side in the aft section of the plane, unable to sleep, unable to turn the worry off in their minds, exhaustion and defeat a blanket over them.\n But the entire team looked up as a nervous crew member crept down the steps, brandishing a large silver cross.\n \"There\u0027s a call from the Vatican for you, Father Patrick,\" the thin, frightened man said, his blond hair plastered to his scalp as he leaned over the rail and called out.\n \"The Vatican?\" Father Patrick said, standing quickly and hurrying to the steps that led to the conference room. \"At this hour?\"\n \"Please, Father,\" the clerical crewman said, his voice filled with fear. \"It\u0027s urgent.\"\n All eyes were on the priest as he rushed up the spiral staircase and entered the conference room. A thud followed him, as did the certain click of the door being safely latched behind him by the crew.\n Within moments Father Patrick was at the top of the stairs. \"Carlos,\" he said, his voice anxious. \"It\u0027s for you. Bring Rider.\"\n Both men stood and ran down the wide cabin aisle, the teams tensing for another possible incident.\n Carlos entered the conference room and grabbed the phone. Before he put it to his ear, he asked Father Patrick, \"Who is it?\"\n \"A woman, but she won\u0027t identify herself,\" Father Patrick said. He glanced at Rider. \"I thought that it might be Juanita, but there was something in her voice that troubled me.\"\n Carlos put the phone to his ear. \"Yeah. Talk to me.\"\n \"Councilman,\" the unidentified woman said with a rush of relief. \"So much has happened. Open a secure lock so I can transfer quickly.\"\n He instantly remembered Tara\u0027s voice. It made him aware that he hadn\u0027t forgotten everything he\u0027d learned and every imprint he\u0027d carried from his old line. He nearly stared at the phone, but for Rider\u0027s sake, didn\u0027t. He also didn\u0027t repeat the name. \"I don\u0027t go by that title any longer,\" he said, hesitating. \"And I can\u0027t lock with you.\"\n \"Tara,\" Rider whispered, instantly knowing a female vampire was on the line based on Carlos\u0027s response and the fact that Father Patrick had said there was a woman on the phone. He also knew it could only be one that he\u0027d trust with Father Patrick\u0027s number. \"How did she get through Vatican phones? I need to talk to her.\"\n \"She didn\u0027t,\" Father Patrick said quickly. \"My safe-house number was routed to another safe house that\u0027s tracking us, and the Covenant must have put it through using their code to link. Time is short. If she\u0027s in L.A., she\u0027s ten hours behind us. But once the sun rises here, we will lose the link.\"\n \"Are you somewhere safe? It\u0027s six P.M. here, but I sense dawn near you... have you fed?\" Tara hesitated. Her voice held true concern and honest compassion.\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" Carlos said, ignoring all her references to his old way of life. \"Where\u0027s Yonnie?\"\n Rider stared at Carlos.\n \"Safe. Trying to get some answers. I don\u0027t have much time, and I can\u0027t hold the link much longer. I\u0027m supposed to give you a number. I\u0027m sending it now.\"\n \"No,\" Carlos said, knowing she was trying to send it telepathically. He looked at Father Patrick. \"I need to write it down.\" But the fact that she was now strong enough to send an airborne transmission this far had to mean one thing. Yonnie had elevated her from a fourth-gen to second lieutenant. Elevating a vampire was a very sensual act. Carlos couldn\u0027t look at Rider as guilt stabbed at him.\n The elder cleric quickly provided the instruments Carlos needed, and he heard Tara\u0027s instant gasp. Her horror rattled his skeleton. A councilman needed paper and pen. She swallowed hard, as though crying inside.\n \"Watch the numbers as you write them. Yonnie did this for you and still stands with you, as do I.\"\n Carlos nodded and jotted down the ten-digit alphanumeric code, then watched several of the numbers reverse and transform on the paper. The nines became sixes. The threes became eights. The sevens melted into fives. He then wrote down the new code, too. The numbers didn\u0027t change.\n \"Ten thousand,\" she said. \"From the account established by Berkfield.\"\n He wrote it down and stared at it.\n \"That\u0027s all they left you.\"\n He stared at the number in disbelief. But then he watched the zeros continually affix themselves behind zeros until a hundred million dollars graced the legal pad.\n Carlos let his breath out slowly. He closed his eyes and sat down with a wobbly thud and shoved the paper into the side pocket of his African robe.\n \"Your family will not forsake you as long as we exist. We love you, and you need resources,\" she said, her voice filled with panic. \"Carlos,it\u0027s all gone . The demon wolfen clans overran the L.A. club. Council sweepers have compromised all the lairs. All lower gens have been assassinated. Blood Music had its ownership transferred to council-compromised humans in a hostile takeover on Wall Street, just to keep you from receiving the monies from it. From Yonnie\u0027s sensing, all of North America, South America, and your Caribbean lairs and holdings have either been destroyed, transferred to council loyalists, or pillaged by roaming were-demon clans and lower gens from other zones not on the Vampire Council\u0027s hit list. But even those have fractured into feudal law. Even the Guardian compound burned to the ground.\"\n Carlos had known that the chairman would go to extreme lengths to blot him and everything he\u0027d built from the face of the earth, but he was still stunned. He was glad he was still sitting down. \"Everything, even the Guardian compound?\" he asked numbly.\n \"The compound?\" Father Patrick held onto the edge of the table for support.\n \"What?\" Rider said, stepping closer to him.\n But Carlos waved him away and listened intently.\n \"Mr. Councilman, vampires couldn\u0027t have acted alone,\" Tara said, answering Carlos\u0027s unspoken question. \"Power to breach protection lines had to come from level seven,\" she said, terror evident in her voice.\n Carlos nodded, unable to speak. It had been confirmed. No further guesswork needed. If level seven was on his ass, and could get through compound barriers, then what fucking chance did Damali have out there on her own without even her blade? As soon as he thought it, his mother and grandmother\u0027s faces flashed in his mind.\n \"My mother and-\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, sir,\" Tara said, a sob breaking her voice. \"We got there only in time to save the girl.\"\n \"How?\" he said, his voice a low rumble filled with rage.\n \"A gas line exploded beneath the house.\"\n \"Tell me,\" he said, hot tears stinging his eyes and choking his voice.\n \"It was fast. Mercifully so, sir.\"\n Carlos nodded and drew in a ragged breath. \"Tell Yonnie I said thank you,\" he whispered. \"I\u0027ll let you know where to send resource transfers. For this, I need an army.\"\n \"Done,\" she said, the sound of her voice weakening as the gray filter of near-dawn began to peek over the horizon. \"We stand ready for your orders.\"\n Carlos reached out to hang up the phone, but Rider grabbed his wrist.\n \"I need to talk to her.\"\n Carlos thrust the receiver at him and turned away to walk out the door. But a sudden crash against the side of the plane sent the phone sliding across the table, and all men standing to the floor.\n \"Mayday, Mayday,\" the captain\u0027s voice shouted over the intercom. \"We\u0027re under attack! Brace for an aerial assault!\"\n The lights went out, the emergency lights on the floor of the aircraft summarily lit and then went black. The engine sputtered as the plane rocked again. Guardians and Covenant team voices shouted in the cabin mayhem below. Machine-gun fire from the aircraft\u0027s turrets echoed within the plane as Rider, Carlos, and Father Patrick struggled to get to their feet and down the spiral steps.\n The whoosh of a missile leaving its housing sent the plane into a dangerous list. Battering sounds clamored at the skin of the aircraft generating high-pitched scrabbling screeches like claws going down a blackboard. The sky lit with multiple red and orange target strikes, splattering green and black gook against the windows as the pilots maneuvered the plane into a hard semiroll. The team clung to seats as they were thrown side-to-side, and thrashed to right themselves while futilely grabbing at weapons as the air battle commenced.\n Carlos looked on in horror as the swirling black cloud of harpies approached again, passed the bank of side windows, and dove beneath the plane\u0027s belly. Their impact slammed into the hull, taking out the landing gear. Their feral grimaces mocked the living inside the plane as their faces pressed to every window, bearing fangs. Smoke was billowing from a fractured wing. Flames had erupted in the other. Something tore at the skin of the plane, opening a vacuum suction through the conference-room wall.\n Before anyone could draw a breath, weapons, debris, food carts, and furniture were instantly sucked up through the rip, hurling human-crew bodies into the void as oxygen masks dropped. Guardians linked arms and weighted themselves to teammates and seats that were straining against their anchors, making the Covenant a part of their lifting human chain.\n Flashes of light immediately entered the cabin, and suddenly three large entities unfurled massive white wings, staying the suction and sealing the rip with light. The light emanating from them was so bright that the teams could not stare at them. Only Carlos could lift his head to see his reflection in their raised golden shields and glowing, polished broadswords, his eyes blazing silver against the metallic surfaces.\n \"Fear not,\" one entity said.\n \"We guard the dawn,\" another said.\n \"An army will be raised,\" the third said, as the plane began a dangerous spiral to the ground.\n The light snapped back, receding like the passing sun and swallowing away the entities that had stepped out of it. But the seal on the aircraft\u0027s torn exterior held.\n \"We\u0027re going down!\" the captain shouted, his voice laden with hysteria as his words broke up over the intercom and the engines went dead.\n DAMALI STOOD and brushed herself off and looked around. The emotional pain of seeing and being separated so abruptly from her parents still lingered, but she had to do what she had to do and just suck it up. She\u0027d fallen against the steps of what seemed to be a beautiful wooden house, but upon further inspection of the multilingual signage, she learned it was the Addis Ababa Museum.\n Unsure of which way to go, she tried to get her bearings and organize the jumble of experiences in her battered brain. Museums kept popping up-there was a reason. As soon as she thought it, an inner knowing replied: Old history. Draw power from it. Lilith was old history, too.\n Feeling steadier, she began walking away from the building, using her senses to guide her.\n Unlike the other structures, nothing in this one particularly called out to her or jettisoned her through its doors. She stopped walking. Her sensory awareness was slowly coming back. The sensation that washed through her created as much joy as recognizing an old friend. It gave her energy, made her want to laugh, and she continued along an unknown street with a satisfied smile on her face. Perhaps something was starting to go right in her life. She could only hope that her team had stayed the course and would be on their way to Ethiopia soon.\n A certain confidence filled her, even though her stick was gone. If she could manage to barter using the silver in her ears and whatever gold was tucked in her hair under the fabric wrap to eat and hang out at the local holy shrines, she\u0027d last through a few nights until she could search for her team. Meanwhile, if she could only get to a phone... Then it dawned upon her-none of them had a cell phone on them since they\u0027d been in the battle at Sydney. Very strange.\n It was as though all normal means of communication and resources had been cut off. But she took heart in the fact that she knew there had to be a reason. She stopped walking. The gifts and the number thirteen slammed into her brain. Yeah. She rattled the abilities off in her mind like a laundry list, taking none of what she\u0027d originally been given for granted.\n Five senses. As a Neteru, she had heightened awareness in all areas, and that had been severely damaged. If it was coming back now, the added bonuses might also. All Neterus had bodies designed to take a blow, plus preternatural endurance. They had the ability to withstand a bite in battle and not turn. Immunity. Visions, extrasensory awareness. Excellent battle tactics, gleaned from the Akashic Records of all generals before them. Ability to be a healer... yes, she remembered how she\u0027d helped Marlene in Brazil. And how could she forget the twelfth gift that had almost been her ruination-the ability to lure master vampires to a state of frenzy from her scent.\n The Isis blade was a tool, not a gift, when put in context with all the others. She was clear about that now, and knew the queens wouldn\u0027t have taken it away if it were. Not with what she was facing. Although she sure wished she still had it on her, regardless. But what was the thirteenth gift she was supposed to be looking for? If she couldn\u0027t figure it out as a more seasoned Neteru, then how was she going to help Carlos find it? She was missing a critical piece of the puzzle.\n Damali shrugged away her doubt as she began to aimlessly walk down the streets. She refused to allow the question to lacerate her. She tried to get a sense of time and date. Was it October thirty-first, November first? Going through the purple light left her unsure. But one thing she did know for a fact, all this went down and had started seven days before Carlos\u0027s birthday-something she hadn\u0027t even entered into the equation until the strange cabbie had approached her in the streets of Philly.\n There was a link. Dates, numbers, locations all had meaning. She knew that like she knew her name. So what was the deal with being thrust into Ethiopia? Questions swirled in her mind as she walked, and she took pleasure in what she now could tell was the early morning beginnings of a sprawling, dusty city of vibrant colors coming to life. The air was cool, temperate, for what she\u0027d believed Africa to be. As she continued onward the huge market she\u0027d stumbled upon awed her. She people-watched and enjoyed the early vendors creating a clamor of chaotic activity as she strolled past their stands while they set up for business.\n The hubbub of activity was fascinating. Incense and vegetables, meats and jewelry, everything was there that one could imagine. She stopped at several jewelry stands, marveling at how the earrings she wore so resembled what many of the shopkeepers offered. Once again, it gave her pause. The old queens had adorned her to be able to barter in a place without cash. Damali smiled.\n A table with a tent and an elaborate array of finely carved walking sticks made her stop and gape. One cane reminded her of Marlene\u0027s, and in the row of beautiful ebony woods, she saw a very plain stick gnarled in the same spots as the one she\u0027d lost. She reached out to touch it, and a man came from behind his truck bearing boxes, which made her draw back her hand.\n \"Tenanastellen. Dehna Neh?\" he said with a wide smile that broadened the one on Damali\u0027s face.\n She shook her head and gave him a shy shrug to try to tell him that she didn\u0027t understand a word he\u0027d said. She stared at his dark, long, handsome face, judging him to be near forty. He wore a plain, dingy, khaki pants, woven straw sandals, but a brilliant turquoise African-cut shirt with elaborate satin embroidery of the same hue that added magnificent color accents and intensity to his chiseled features. His shoulders were held back straight, his carriage impeccable, and his head held high and proud, but there was a very accessible warmth about his attitude as he came nearer to her.\n \"Hello, how are you?\" he said, restating his greeting. \"You are not from here, I can tell.\"\n Damali chuckled. \"No, and thank you so much for speaking to me in English. I wish I knew your language, though.\"\n \"To say thank you, in Amharic, it is,amesegenallo .\" He offered a slight bow and then rounded the table. \"So beautiful and no one to escort you?\"\n Damali laughed harder and shook her head no. African men were such a trip, persistent. In an oddly sentimental way, although she was not sure why, he reminded her of the African master when he took her hand, swept the back of it with a respectful kiss, and glanced up.\n Maybe it was the regal flourish in which he did it, or the ever-present magnetic sexuality that seemed to just ooze from men from the region. There was an \"it\" factor that they seemed to possess, and she studied him as he looked up and smiled, asking a mischievous question about her availability with his eyes. She wondered if she\u0027d become so accustomed to battling dark forces that she\u0027d lost her ability to see the basic nature within regular people. Given what she\u0027d experienced, the vendor\u0027s slight gesture and his resemblance to something she\u0027d just fought should have sent off alarm bells within her. But she knew this man wasn\u0027t anything to fear. It was simply his way, and it tickled her no end to realize that the refinement of approaching females hadn\u0027t changed in several thousand years.\n \"It would take many,many years to teach you our languages,\" he said with pride. \"There are as many as the people, and the script of Ge\u0027ez, the one used in the churches, has two hundred and thirty-one letters. But many of us have learned English in school.\" He gave her a wink and waved his hand before his table of wares. \"So, you have seen something here you like?\"\n Damali nodded and affixed her gaze to his table as she considered what he\u0027d said. She did the math, the language used in churches... with as many peoples as the languages... and he was fluent in hers, thus they could communicate. But he was also letting her know he\u0027d received some formal education, a point of pride. Damali offered his comment a gracious nod that seemed to please him. She also knew why she\u0027d instantly recognized his language to be Amharic. It was used in the old liturgical services. Yeah... Marlene had told her that.\n \"I noticed you had a plain one on the table,\" Damali said, her thoughts leap-frogging as she stared down. \"Why is this one so plain, when all the others have designs on them?\"\n He laughed. \"It is often the plain that are the most powerful.\"\n Now she looked at him.\n He smiled and nodded. \"Thank you for returning it.\"\n She didn\u0027t move.\n He reached into his pocket and made a fist, chuckling as he slowly withdrew it and opened his hand. She stared down at her silver earring as he held it out to her.\n \"Now, I have returned what you loaned me.\" He walked away and began unloading items from his small Toyota pickup truck.\n Damali was on his heels. \"We need to talk, and I have to ask you alot of questions.\"\n He wagged his finger at her. \"No, you must ask my father. Did my son not give you his address?\"\n Instant memory snapped back as Damali shoved her hand into the pocket of her robe. \"Yes,\" she said, pleased. \"But how do I find him?\"\n \"He is a long way away, in Askum,\" the man said. \"But I have people who can get us there. This is why I must unload my truck so we can go to the north.\"\n \"I\u0027ll help you,\" Damali offered, wanting to hurry and get the show on the road.\n \"No,\" he said with a deep chuckle. \"Be still, then we will go and eat someinjera, alicha wat , andshiro , withambo . No meat in what we eat now, for we are on a pilgrimage, yes. So look about and learn to have patience. Enjoy this place that is called Thirteen Months of Sunshine.\"\n That number associated with the sun as a country slogan made her simply stare at him.\n Carlos managed to drag himself into a seat, as had all the others, bracing for the sure impact. There was no way to survive a crash from this altitude as mountains whirled by; it was futile. They all knew it. Perhaps that\u0027s why no one, except the pilots, was screaming. An eerie calm had befallen the cabin. Everyone\u0027s head was tucked down to their knees with their seat belts secured. What was the point, though? Oxygen masks dangled, but no one had reached for them to cover their faces. Whatever the entities had done, breathing within the compromised aircraft was possible. The Light had a very strange sense of putting things right. Let them breathe, then let them crash. Carlos wasn\u0027t sure if he was more angry or afraid; perhaps it was a mixture of both.\n The sound of rapid descent was creating a horrible whine of impending doom. Then a gunshot made Carlos lift his head and simply look out the window. He could see it in his mind just as clear as day. One of the pilots had opted out of the anxiety of watching oneself crash and burn. The other was already dead-skull cracked from being flung against hard metal during the battle. The copilot\u0027s brains added to the gore against the windows. Now was a fine time for his inner vision to be coming back. But what had triggered it? Sure death?\n Carlos affixed his gaze to the layers of thick white clouds set within a flawless blue sky. The ground was becoming larger, its green carpet and small dots of buildings now becoming recognizable. But peace filled him. It would soon be over. It just hurt him to know that people he\u0027d come to know and love like family were going to perish, all because they\u0027d tried to cheat fate.\n He looked at the teams, each man and one woman, bravely bracing themselves for the end. No one cried out, no one screamed. Marlene\u0027s low murmur of prayers had blended in with those of the Covenant. Their faith and acceptance of what was to come was truly amazing to him. Humbling, is what it was. Because all along they had been right. There was another side. A dark side and a light side in dimensions he could have never fathomed while he was simply alive. And he wondered where they would all go; if he\u0027d ever meet up with them again. He wondered if the Light would have mercy on them for trying so desperately to spare his lowly soul and smuggle his resurrected body to a safe haven.\n \"Whatever you do,\" Carlos murmured, as he stared at the team, \"don\u0027t blame them, and especially, don\u0027t blame her.\"\n Empathy dulled the fear even more. He\u0027d been tortured already, knew what it felt like to be broken, gutted, his insides twisted, skin shredded, bones shattered, body parts amputated, and to be burned alive. But these people were human, had never experienced the twisted knife of pain to that degree. All he could hope for would be that the plane would explode on impact, that his family wouldn\u0027t be left half alive, semiconscious, and torn to butchered bits. \"Make it fast,\" he whispered. \"That\u0027s the least you can do.\"\n His prayer became more urgent as the treetops came into view.\n Carlos stared at the bent backs before him as a wing collided with a cliff side and was shorn off. His head slammed into the seat in front of him and bounced off it, nearly snapping his neck-but he refused to cover his head or his face. He\u0027d stared death down before in the dark, and in the brightness of dawn would do no less.\n The horrible turbine sound against the wind seemed to become muted as his hands clutched the arms of his seat. Flickers of fast-moving light darted between the aisles and swirled around each of the people he watched. Maybe he had snapped his neck? All the better. Maybe the strike against his head had him seeing stars and had deafened him? Mercy was measured in increments and during moments when time seemed to have slowed down, it was indeed a blessing.\n He watched the dancing white lights, dazed and fascinated, despite his pending death. He had to be hallucinating, that was the only rational answer that came to him as he watched the oblique forms become people he knew but should have never known.\n Parents had come to their children. Aged spirits touched faces gently, put loving arms around each passenger, and made their peace. He could hear them all at once as well as individually as they hugged their deathborne children to them.\n He saw Marlene become encircled first by what seemed to be a tribe of elderly people that he instantly knew were from the Gullah Islands. Why he knew that, he wasn\u0027t sure, but he watched her mother and father gently touch her face, tell her she\u0027d done her job, it was good, she had struggled long and it was time to come home. Rider and Father Patrick, Jose... Big Mike-each of them were touched until every Guardian and member of the Covenant was attended by Light beings that placed their silvery orbs around each person, leaving no space between the seats, the windows... like padded clouds they wrapped around them.\n Dan wept and held his grandfather\u0027s hand. Jose was sobbing and hugging his grandmother to him tightly. Berkfield laid his head in his mother\u0027s lap. Father Patrick stroked his wife\u0027s hair as his son hugged his back. Monk Lin was encircled by a bastion of Tibetan brothers, and Imam Asula had elders around him that were so old and wise that Carlos could not make out their faces.\n A sense of lonely abandonment made him weep. No one had come for him in the last moments, and he simply covered his face with his hands. Had he been so bad that even his own brother... or his mother... or his grandmom wouldn\u0027t come to say goodbye? He hadn\u0027t been able to say good-bye, that\u0027s all he\u0027d wanted, if he couldn\u0027t protect them! And where was his father? Where had he ever been? A gentle breeze blew against his face as the plane jolted again.\n Carlos looked up as a male hand touched his hair. \"Papi?\" He couldn\u0027t breathe as he saw his father standing tall and strong and whole beside his mother. She looked so young and was smiling; his grandmother was beside them both.\n \"I was wrong... I\u0027m proud of you and love you,\" his father said. \"You have suffered so much, now come home.Por favor , Carlos... my most troublesome, but favorite, son.\"\n His father embraced him and a sob tore up and out of his throat as the plane hit the ground hard, bounced, and the tail section broke away.\n \"We love you,\" Alejandro said, holding his head firm as another devastating smack waffled the plane\u0027s underbelly.\n Smoke had begun filling the cabin and the stench of gasoline filled the air as the aircraft skipped against the ground like a pebble skeeting across the surface of a pond. Carlos squinted, refusing to allow the thick black plumes to eclipse the faces he\u0027d loved and missed so dearly. Hands touched him, held him, caressed him, his sister, his cousins, his boys, they had all come. \"I want to go home,\" he croaked, clutching his mother\u0027s hand so tightly that her silvery essence oozed between his fingers. \"I\u0027m so sorry...\"\n Water lapped at his feet, a hard rocking collision threw his body forward, and something soft braced his neck and spine as the slam lifted him and set him back down hard, jarring his teeth to near chipping. Then everything went silent and black within the cabin.\n He could hear people coughing; the aircraft wasn\u0027t moving. He heard someone vomit, someone was sobbing. Carlos quickly felt his torso, his neck, and his legs with his hands. He seemed to be in one piece. His seat belt was mysteriously unfastened. He instantly stood, and covered his nose and mouth against the smoke.\n It was blinding, but he could somehow see through it. Gasoline fumes made him bend and hurl as he moved forward, ignoring the chunks of vomit that now covered his sandaled feet. They\u0027d made it. Some of them had. He began calling out names as he blindly rushed forward. Then his sight became like laser, cutting through the smoke in a silver wash. He picked Dan up and flung him over his shoulder, then yanked at Big Mike\u0027s uninjured arm, shoving at Shabazz and Rider as he went for the door. \"We have to get out of here before she explodes!\"\n Damali looked down at the food with disinterest and tried to summon grace. Her stomach was in jumpy knots. But in order to proceed she\u0027d have to feign patience for her gracious host. Something was so wrong she could barely sit in her seat. She could feel it as her newfound friend prattled on about his homeland.\n \"You eat it like this,\" he said, tearing off a piece of the spongy, foam rubber-like bread from the common bowl they shared. \"The bread is calledinjera , and you dip it this way to get thealicha wat up and into your mouth.\" He extended his hand for her to take a small taste, his eyes holding expected excitement.\n Damali leaned forward and took in the mildly spiced concoction of vegetables and forced a smile. Under different circumstances, she would have enjoyed the tasty dish, even though she wasn\u0027t ready for the Ethiopian way of sharing a communal bowl. The custom was just a tad too familiar for her liking, and not using utensils to share the dish was somewhat disturbing-she had no idea where this man\u0027s hands had been, but at least she\u0027d blessed the food first. Besides, for all her powers, she couldn\u0027t tell if this was just an Ethiopian patience endurance test, or if this man was stalling because he was subtlety hitting on her.\n She took a swig of sparkling bottled water, which she\u0027d learned was calledambo . \"This is very good,\" she said, truly meaning it, but needing to get going more than she needed to eat. However, she was quickly learning that in African culture, if you wanted to get anything done, one had to employ patience-eat with people, break bread, and pass a quiet vibe test-thenyou could handle business.\n \"But you cannot eat like a bird,\" the man said laughing. \"Have someshin . You must be strong for the journey.\"\n Her nerves were about to snap, but she leaned forward and accepted a taste of the spicy lentil and chickpea mush with a smile. It slowly dawned upon her that the sooner she just ate the dag-gone food without picking at it with resistance in her soul, the quicker they\u0027d be on their way. Damali took a deep breath and sighed, and then tore off a large section of bread to begin scarfing down the communal meal.\n \"That\u0027s more like it,\" he said, clapping his hands in triumph. \"Try themesser -it\u0027s black lentils, andye som megeb -that\u0027s a medley of vegetable dishes we traditionally serve during fasting.\"\n Damali nodded, mumbling her assent to try whatever, as long as they got going soon. \"Tell me about this area, Askum,\" she said through a gooey mouthful of food. She had to understand what the link was here.\n \"Ah... Askum...\" her guide said. \"First, to discuss Askum, we must understand the history of this country.\"\n Damali groaned, but when he gave her a fishy look, she passed the sound off as her enjoyment of the food.\n That seemed to mollify him. He perked up, widened his smile, and leaned forward with great pride in his expression.\n \"Our country is known as the Cradle of Humanity. It all startedhere , they even have the bones of Lucy in the National Museum for proof. But we do not need the bones to tell us what we know,\" he quipped, sitting up taller in his chair. He glanced around the outdoor cafe and waved his arm toward the diversely colorful moving throng of people that milled about. \"We were the only ones, theonly country, that was never colonized.\"\n Just as his long, winding history lesson was about to bore her to tears, she got part of the answer she was searching for.It all started here . In the Cradle of Humanity. The first Eden. Lilith\u0027s origin in the garden before she banished herself. And these people had been fighting everything she\u0027d wrought since the beginning of time. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-vampire-huntress-legend-5/page-8.html","bookId":2529,"book":{"id":2529,"title":"The Forbidden (Vampire Huntress Legend #5)","description":"Storyline: \n The Forbidden (Vampire Huntress Legend #5) \n The Body of a Goddess...with the Heart of Hell itself. \n The devil is a dead-beat dad and his consort Lilith couldn\u0027t care less.
