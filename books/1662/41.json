That’s all…that’s all I want.” A knot formed in my throat and my chest tightened, cutting off my voice. I didn’t want him to leave, so I nodded. Relief flickered across his stoic face, softening the hard lines, and then he walked around to his side, kicked off his shoes, and slid into bed beside me. He moved closer, extending an arm, and I went, curling against his body, my head nestled in the space between his shoulder and chest. “I kind of like being your body pillow,” he admitted, a smile in his voice. “Even if you drool on me.” “I do not drool.” I smiled, placing my hand over his heart. “What about tailing Vaughn?” “That can wait until tomorrow.” He tilted his head to the side, his lips moving against my hair as he spoke. “Get some rest, Kitten. I’ll be gone before morning.” Under my hand, the steady beat of his heart matched my own, slightly accelerated. Was it the healing or just being this close? I didn’t know. But before I knew it, I’d drifted into the deepest, calmest sleep I’d had in weeks. Chapter 26 The irate sound of “KATY ANN SWARTZ!” being yelled, followed by a husky male laugh was what roused me from the satisfying haze of deep sleep. My eyes fluttered open, and I tried to remember the last time Mom had used my full name. Oh yeah, it had been years ago, when I’d tried to pet a baby opossum that had gotten on our balcony somehow. Mom stood in my bedroom doorway, dressed in her robe, her mouth hanging open. Will stood behind her, one a strange, satisfied smile on his face. “What?” I mumbled. My hard pillow moved. Glancing down, I felt my cheeks burn hot. Daemon was still in my bed. And I was half lying on him. One of his hands was wrapped around mine, pinning it against his chest. OhmyGodno… Mortified on an epic level, I pulled my hand free. “This isn’t what it looks like.” “It’s not?” Mom folded her arms. “They’re just kids,” Will said, grinning. “At least they’re fully clothed.” “Not helping,” she shot back. I started to sit up, but Daemon’s arm tightened around my waist as he rolled into me, nuzzling my neck. Wanting to die a thousand deaths, I pushed at him. He didn’t budge. His eyes opened into thin slits. “Mmm, what’s your problem?” I stared meaningfully at the doorway. Frowning, he turned his head and froze. “Oh, wow, awkward.” He cleared his throat as he removed his arm from my waist. “Good morning, Ms. Swartz.” Mom smiled tightly. “Good morning, Daemon. I think it’s time for you to go home.” Daemon left as fast as humanly possible after that. Mom went downstairs without saying a word. Knowing I was in trouble, I passed Will in the hallway. He was barefoot. Apparently, I wasn’t the only female in the house to have had a guy in my bed. I found her shoving the coffee pot into the maker. “Mom, it’s not what you think. I promise.” She turned around, planting her hands on her hips. “You had a boy in your bedroom, in your bed. What am I supposed to think?” “Looks like you had a sleepover, too.” I fixed the pot so it wasn’t half out of the maker. “I’m the adult here. I can have whomever I want in my bed, young lady.” Will laughed form the doorway. “I have to disagree with that. I’m hoping I’m the only one in your bed.” “Ew,” I groaned, going to the fridge to get juice. Mom’s eyes narrowed on her boyfriend. “Is this what you’re doing when I’m working nights, Katy?” I sighed. “No, Mom, I swear it’s not. We were…studying, and we fell asleep.” “You were studying in your bedroom?” She smoothed some of the mussed hair back from her face. “I’ve never had to set rules with you before, but I see there need to be some established.” “Mom,” I groaned, glancing at Will. “Come on…” “There will be no boys in your bedroom. Ever.” She pulled the creamer out. “There will be no boys staying the night in any part of this house.” Sitting down, I sipped my OJ. “Can you stop referring to boys in the plural? Geez.” She poured herself a cup of coffee. “Blake is here all the time. And then there is Daemon. So, yes, it’s boys in the plural sense.” I bristled. “Neither of them is my boyfriend.” “Is that supposed to make me feel better about one of them being in your bed?” She took a drink of her coffee and then scrunched up her nose in distaste. “Honey, I’ve never had to worry about you doing anything stupid.” I stood and handed her the sugar she forgot. “I’m not doing anything stupid. Nothing is happening with either of them. We’re just friends.” She ignored the last statement. “I can’t be here a lot, and I have to trust you. Please tell me that you’re being…safe.” “Oh my God, Mom, I’m not having sex.” Her look told me she wasn’t entirely convinced. “Just make sure you’ll be careful. You don’t want to be a young mother.” “Oh, dear God,” I whispered, hiding my face behind my hands. “And I am concerned,” she continued. “First it was Daemon, then you seemed to have started seeing Blake, but now…” “I’m not seeing either of them,” I said for what felt like the hundredth time. “You two did look very close.” Will propped a hip against the sink, watching us. “You and Daemon.” “This really isn’t any of your business,” I said, angry that he was here for such a private and excruciatingly embarrassing conversation. “Katy,” Mom snapped. Will laughed it off. “No. It’s okay, Kell. She’s right. This isn’t my business. But there does seem to be some history between you two.” For a moment, his smile reminded me of someone. Fake. Plastic. Nancy Husher. I shuddered. God, I was paranoid. “We’re just friends.” “Friends who hold hands while sleeping?” I glanced at my mom, but she was busy studying the inside of her chipped cup. Feeling overly exposed, I folded my arms around me. “I’m sorry, Mom, for upsetting you. It won’t happen again.” “I hope not.” She washed out her coffee cup, wearing a slight frown. “The last thing I want right now is a grandchild.” Done with this conversation, I squeezed past Will and went into the living room. Gah, my mom thought I was making babies. Even I was disturbed by that thought. Grabbing my backpack off the floor, I dragged it to the couch. When I looked up, I saw Mom and Will in the hallway. He was whispering something to her, and she laughed softly. Before I could look away, he kissed her…but our eyes locked. Hours later, Will was still in the house—my house. Not his. Was this how my Saturdays would be when Mom was off? Watching the two of them working on crossword puzzles in between making out? I wanted to claw my eyes out. The way he stared at me made my skin feel like a thousand dirty roaches were crawling under it. It had to be my paranoia, but I couldn’t shake the ugh factor. I checked my blog real quickly and found that I had over twenty comments on my IMM. Curious for the sudden comment love, I scrolled through them. Some of them gushed over the books I had. Others gushed over the boy who’d been sitting beside me. Dammit. He’d hijacked my blog. Putting in earbuds, I listened to some tunes while reading my English assignment. Mom appeared sometime later, and I tugged out the buds, hoping we weren’t going to have another sex conversation. Especially when I knew Will was right in the kitchen, making himself at home. “Honey, Dee is here to see you.” Then she walked over and flipped my textbook shut. “And before you say you’re busy or have plans with a boy, you need to get up and go talk to her.” I took the last bite of my cold Pop-Tart and frowned. “Oookay…” She pushed back her side-swept bangs. “You can’t spend every waking second studying and hanging out with Blake or whomever.” Or whomever? Like I had this long list of boys. I sighed as I stood. Before I left the room, I caught her staring at the Christmas tree, and I wondered what she was thinking. Dee was waiting outside, a vision in white. It took me a few seconds to realize the white sweater she wore had blended into the background. It was snowing heavily, so much so I could barely see the tree line a few yards away. “Hey,” I said lamely. She blinked and her eyes immediately darted from my face. “Hey,” she responded with forced enthusiasm. “I hope I’m not bothering you.” I leaned against the door. “Well, I just started my English paper. Wanted to kind of get that out of the way.” “Oh.” Her pink lips turned down. “Well, it’s going to have to wait. We’re going to watch a movie.” I stepped back. With everything that was going on and all the lies, being around Dee was hard. “Maybe some other time, because I’m really busy. How about next weekend?” I didn’t wait for an answer. I started to shut the door. Dee did the super-speed crap and pushed the door back open. She looked like an angry little pixie. “That was extremely rude, Katy.” I flushed. I couldn’t deny that and still, it obviously hadn’t driven her away. “I’m sorry. I’m just so swamped with schoolwork.” “I understand that.” She pushed the door farther open. “But you’re going to the movies with Adam and me.” “Dee—” “You’re not backing out of it.” Her eyes met mine, and I saw the hurt in them. I swallowed, looking away. “I know you and Daemon are…well, whatever’s going on between you two, and you’re doing whatever with Blake and I’ve been spending a lot of time with Adam, but that doesn’t mean we can’t be friends.” She rocked back on her heels, clasping her hands under her chin. “Just put your shoes on, Katy, and go to the movies with me. Please. I miss you. Please.” How could I say no? I turned slightly, spying my mom standing in the doorway to the kitchen. The look on her face pleaded with me, too. I was caught between the two, and neither knew that I was trying to stay away from Dee for her own good. “Please,” Dee whispered. I remembered Daemon telling me I was being a shitty friend. I wasn’t trying to be, and Dee didn’t deserve that. I nodded. “Let me grab my hoodie and shoes.” She jumped forward and gave me a quick, tight hug. “I’ll be waiting right here.” Just in case I tried to sneak out of it, I supposed. Passing my mom a look, I grabbed my hoodie off the back of the recliner and slipped into a pair of knee-high, fake-sheepskin boots. Pocketing money in my jeans, I headed out into the brisk December afternoon.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-41.html","bookId":1662,"book":{"id":1662,"title":"Onyx (Lux #2)","description":"Storyline: Onyx (Lux #2) Being connected to Daemon Black sucks… Thanks to his alien mojo, Daemon’s determined to prove what he feels for me is more than a product of our bizarro connection.
