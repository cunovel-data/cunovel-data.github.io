I wondered if she still had dreams of going to college overseas. He stretched as if he were trying to rid himself of some sort of tension that had suddenly settled over him. I scooted away, giving him more room. “If you haven’t noticed yet, there are more males than females. So the females are paired off very quickly and protected above all.” I made a face. “Paired off and mated? I understand it—you guys need to reproduce. But Dee can’t be forced to do that. It’s not fair. You should control your own lives.” He glanced at me, deep shadows in his eyes. “But we don’t, Kitten.” I shook my head. “It’s not right.” “It’s not. Most Luxen don’t push for anything different. Dawson did. He loved Bethany.” Daemon exhaled raggedly. “We were against it. And I thought he was stupid for falling for a human. No offense.” “None taken.” “It was hard for him. Our group was upset with him, but Dawson…he was the strong one.” Daemon smiled as he shook his head. “He didn’t cave, and if the colony had discovered the truth, I don’t think they would’ve changed him.” “Couldn’t he have left with her, snuck past the DOD? Maybe that’s what happened?” “Dawson loved it here. He was big on hiking and outdoors. He was into the whole rustic-living thing.” Daemon glanced at me. “He’d never leave, especially without telling Dee or me. I know both of them are dead.” He smiled again. “You would’ve liked Dawson. Looked just like me but a much better guy. Not a douchebag, in other words.” A lump formed in my throat. “I’m sure I would’ve, but you’re not bad.” He arched a brow. “Okay, you’re prone to moments of great dickdom, but you’re not bad.” I paused, holding the pillow tight. “Do you want to know what I honestly think?” “Should I be worried?” I laughed. “There’s a really nice guy under the jerk. I’ve seen glimpses of him. So while I probably want to beat the crap out of you most of the time, I really don’t think you’re a bad guy. You have a lot of responsibility.” Daemon tilted his head back and chuckled. “Well, I guess that’s not too bad.” I shrugged. “Can I ask you a question and you tell me the truth?” “Always,” he swore. I reached around my neck and pulled at the dainty chain. The obsidian came into view, and I held it in my hand. “The DOD is a bigger concern than the Arum, aren’t they?” His lips thinned, but he didn’t lie. “Yes.” I ran a finger over the wire twisted at the top of the crystal. “What would they do if they knew I was moving things like you?” “They’d probably do the same thing they’d do to us if they knew.” Daemon reached out and cupped my hand that held the obsidian. He laid his finger over mine, stopping my movements. “They’d lock you up…or worse. But I’m not going to let that happen.” My skin tingled where it made contact with his. “But how can you live like this? Like, just waiting for them to find out there’s more to you guys?” His fingers curled around mine, enclosing the pendant until we both held it in our hands. “It’s all I’ve known—it’s all any of us have known.” I blinked away the sudden rush of tears. “That’s really kind of sad.” “It’s our life.” He paused. “But don’t worry about them. Nothing will happen to you.” Our faces were only inches apart. His hand was still around mine. Something struck me then. “You’re always protecting others, aren’t you?” He squeezed my hand and then released it. Leaning against the couch, he reached one arm back and rested his head against his curved elbow. He didn’t answer my question. “This hasn’t been a very birthday-friendly conversation.” “It’s okay. You want more milk or anything?” “No, but I would like to know something.” I frowned and stretched out my right leg in the small space he didn’t occupy. He was rather large, so it didn’t leave a lot of room. “What?” “How often do you run through the house singing?” he asked seriously. I kicked at him, but he caught my toes. “You can leave now.” “I seriously love these socks.” “Give me back my foot,” I ordered. “It’s not so much the fact that they’ve got reindeers on them or that they go all the way up to your knees.” As if that were some kind of great distance. “But it’s the fact they’re like mittens on your feet.” Rolling my eyes, I wiggled my toes. “I like them like that. And don’t you dare knock them. I will kick you off this couch.” He raised a brow and continued to inspect them. “Sock mittens, huh? Never seen anything like it. Dee would love them.” I pulled at my foot, and he let go. “Whatever. I’m sure there’re cornier things than my socks. Don’t judge me. It’s the only thing I like about the holidays.” “The only thing? I figured you’re the type of person who wants the Christmas tree to go up on Thanksgiving.” “You celebrate Christmas?” Daemon nodded. “Yes. It’s the human thing to do. Dee loves Christmas. Actually, I think she just loves the idea of presents.” I laughed. “I used to love the holidays. And yeah, I was real big on the Christmas tree when Dad was alive. We’d put it up while watching the parade on Thanksgiving.” “But?” “But Mom is never home on the holidays now. And I know she won’t be this year; since she’s new at the hospital, she’ll get the shaft.” I shrugged. “I’m always alone on the holidays, like some sort of old cat woman.” He didn’t respond but watched me intently. I think he sensed how uncomfortable it made me to admit, because he changed the subject. “So, this Bob guy…” “His name is Blake, and don’t start, Daemon.” “Fine.” His lips tipped up. “He’s not an issue anyway.” My brows furrowed. “What’s that supposed to mean?” Daemon shrugged. “I was kind of surprised when I was in your bedroom while you were sick.” “I’m not sure I want to know about what.” “You had a poster of Bob Dylan on the wall. I expected the Jonas Brothers or something.” “Are you serious? No. Not a fan of pop music. I’m a huge fan of Dave Matthews and older stuff, like Dylan.” He looked surprised, but then he launched into a discussion about his favorite bands, and we were surprised that we had the same tastes. We argued over which Godfather movie was the best and what reality show was the stupidest. Hours went by, and I learned more about Daemon. And there was that different side of him, the one I’d glimpsed a few times in the past. He was relaxed, friendly, and even playful without making me want to bash him upside the head. We did argue over a few things, a bit heatedly, but he wasn’t a jerk. It all suddenly felt easy, and that scared the crap out of me. It was past three a.m. by the time I’d realized how long we’d been talking. I pulled my tired gaze off the clock and looked at him. His eyes had drifted shut and his chest rose and fell evenly. Daemon looked so…peaceful. Not wanting to wake him, I pulled the afghan off the back of the couch and carefully spread it over him. I grabbed a smaller quilt and tucked it around my legs. I could’ve woke him, but I didn’t have it in me. And yeah, there was a teeny, tiny part of me that didn’t want him to leave. I didn’t know what that meant for me. And I didn’t put too much thought into that. Not right now. Not when I was sure my brain would take an obsessive turn into boy land. “Thank you,” he murmured lazily. My eyes widened. “I thought you were asleep.” “Almost, but you’re staring at me.” I flushed. “I am not.” Daemon pried one eye open. “You always blush when you lie.” “I do not.” I felt the flush spread down my neck. “If you keep lying, I think I will have to leave,” he threatened halfheartedly. “I don’t feel like my virtue is safe.” “Your virtue?” I huffed. “Whatever.” “I know how you get.” His eyes closed. Smiling, I snuggled down in my corner of the couch. We never did change the channel. Sometime later I remembered something he had said earlier. “Did you find it?” I asked sleepily. His hand slipped over his chest. “Find what, Kitten?” “What you were searching for?” Daemon’s eyes opened and held mine. The swelling was back in my chest, spreading through my body. There was a spike of something—excitement?—in my lower stomach as the silence stretched out for what felt like an eternity. “Yeah, sometimes, I think I did.” Chapter 11 When I woke up on Monday morning, I wasn’t sure exactly how things were going to play out when I saw Daemon in class. He’d cleared out of the house while I was still asleep and I hadn’t seen him when I hung out with Dee on Sunday, which consisted of watching her suck face with Adam. Guess that phone call went well. Spending time with him Saturday night hadn’t really changed anything between Daemon and me. At least, that was what I kept telling myself. It was just a good moment in a long string of bad ones. And I had bigger and better things to think about. I had a date with Blake after school. But my thoughts kept straying back to Daemon, and a deep fluttering started in my stomach when I thought about us side by side on the couch. Warmth tingled over my neck while Carissa was telling me about a romance book she was reading. I kept my eyes glued to her, but I was well aware of the fact that Daemon was there. He took his seat behind me. A second later, something I’d oddly missed in a messed-up way happened. Daemon poked me in the back with his pen. Lesa’s brows arched, but she wisely said nothing as I twisted around. “Yes?” His half grin was all too familiar. “Reindeer socks today?” “No. Polka dots.” “Sock mittens?” “Regular,” I said, fighting a stupid grin. “I’m not sure how I feel about that.” He tapped his pen on the edge of his desk. “Regular socks just seem so boring after seeing the reindeer socks.” Lesa cleared her throat. “Reindeer socks?” “She has these socks that have reindeers on them and are kind of like a mitten for the toes,” he explained. “Oh, I have a pair like that,” Carissa said, grinning. “But mine have stripes on them. Love them in the winter.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-16.html","bookId":1662,"book":{"id":1662,"title":"Onyx (Lux #2)","description":"Storyline: Onyx (Lux #2) Being connected to Daemon Black sucks… Thanks to his alien mojo, Daemon’s determined to prove what he feels for me is more than a product of our bizarro connection.
