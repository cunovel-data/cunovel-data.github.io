{"id":101449,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"Anticipating the move, an arm took form and swung out. It caught me in the stomach. Up in the air I went, landing on my side. Jarring pain shot through my bones. I rolled onto my back, blinking snow from my lashes.\\n\\n Now I knew why Daemon was so adamant against me running out and fighting the Arum. I’d just got my ass kicked and the fight hadn’t even started.\\n\\n A dark, insidious shadow crept into my vision. Out of human form, when he spoke his voice was a menacing murmur among my own thoughts. You’re not a Luxen, but you’re sssomething unique. What powersss do you have?\\n\\n Powers? The powers Daemon had given me when he mutated me. The Arum would take them by killing me. But I’d killed an Arum before by tapping into Daemon and Dee. Blake believed that ability—that Source—still existed in me. It had to, and if it didn’t, I would die.\\n\\n And I wanted to be able to defend myself. Not lay here. Not wait on someone to save me.\\n\\n What had Blake said to picture? Lightning in the veins and cells surrounded in light?\\n\\n The Arum leaned over me; the tendrils of black smoke were thick and colder than the hard ground. A smoky, transparent smile appeared. Easssier than I thought.\\n\\n I squeezed my eyes shut and pictured every weird cell I’d ever seen in bio class surrounded by light, and I thought about that one moment—that first time I’d ever felt lightning in my veins. I held onto the image as the first brush of the Arum’s cold fingers swept over my cheek. I latched onto the swamping, red-hot lava coursing through my veins.\\n\\n It started with a crackle—a small light burned behind my eyelids. A strange feeling spread down my arm, scalding hot. The light behind my eyes was red-white; the source of the power was utterly destructive, shattering in its complexity.\\n\\n I could feel it burning through my veins, whispering a hundred promises. It called to me, welcomed me home. It had been waiting, wondering when I would heed its call.\\n\\n Wind whipped the snow out from underneath me as I rose. When I opened my eyes, the Arum was gliding back, shifting between human and Arum.\\n\\n I was on my feet now, barely breathing. I could feel it, and it was exciting and terrifying. Every nerve in my body came alive and tingled in anticipation. It wanted to be used, this power. It seemed like the most natural of all things. My fingers curved inward. The world around me was lit in red and white.\\n\\n Destroy.\\n\\n The Arum shifted back into its true form, spreading out and endless like the night sky.\\n\\n There was a snapping sound coming from inside me, and the Source rushed from my fingertips, slamming into the Arum at an alarming speed.\\n\\n He spun into the air, but the Source followed him. Or I made it follow him. But he was shifting forms so quickly it was dizzying. He froze and then shattered into a million thin shreds of glassy shadows.\\n\\n The obsidian cooled against my skin.\\n\\n “Perfect,” Blake said, clapping his hands together. “That was freaking unbelievable. You killed an Arum with one shot!”\\n\\n Waves of electricity returned to me, and the red-white haze faded away. When the Source left, so did most of my energy. I turned to Blake, feeling something else replace the void the Source had left behind. “You…you left me alone with an Arum.”\\n\\n “Yeah, but look at what you did.” He strode forward, grinning at me like I was the prized pupil. “You killed an Arum, Katy. You did it all by yourself.”\\n\\n I took a breath and it hurt. Everything hurt. “What if I hadn’t been able to kill the Arum?”\\n\\n Confusion marked his expression. “But you did.”\\n\\n I stepped back, winced, and realized my pants were soaked and clinging to my chilled, chafed skin. “What if I couldn’t do it?”\\n\\n Blake shook his head. “Then...”\\n\\n “Then I would’ve died.” My hand shook as I placed it on my hip. My entire backside throbbed from the fall. “Do you even care?”\\n\\n “Of course I do!” He moved forward, placing his hand on my shoulder.\\n\\n I yelped as sparks of pain shot straight down my arm. “Don’t…don’t touch me.”\\n\\n In a flash, the confusion was gone and replaced by anger. “You’re overreacting when you should be celebrating. You did something…amazing. Don’t you understand that? No one kills an Arum in one blast.”\\n\\n “I don’t care.” I started limping back toward the car. “I want to go home.”\\n\\n “Katy! Don’t act like this. Everything’s fine. You did—”\\n\\n “Just take me home!” I screamed, close to tears, close to completely shutting down. Because there was something wrong with him. “I just want to go home.”\\n\\n Chapter 25\\n\\n Running late to trig on the last day of classes before break, I eased into my seat and winced. There was a good chance that I’d broken my butt last night. Sitting was extremely painful. Lesa raised a brow as she watched me struggle to get comfortable.\\n\\n “Are you okay?” Daemon asked, causing me to jump a little.\\n\\n “Yeah,” I breathed out as I carefully turned halfway, surprised that he hadn’t poked me. “Just slept wrong.”\\n\\n His eyes were sharp. “Did you sleep on the floor or something?”\\n\\n I laughed dryly. “Feels like it.”\\n\\n Daemon stopped me from turning around. “Kat…”\\n\\n “What?” Unease crept through me. When he looked at me like that I felt exposed to the core.\\n\\n “Never mind.” He sat back, eyes narrowed as he folded his arms. “You still on for tonight?”\\n\\n Biting my lip, I nodded and made a mental note to pick up some energy drinks on the way home. When I’d gotten back last night, I brutalized Mom’s secret chocolate stash. It did nothing to help replenish my energy. Easing back around, I gritted my teeth and ignored the flare of pain. It could be worse. I could be dead right now.\\n\\n Sitting in the seat during class sucked to the nth degree. My body ached from hitting the cold, hard ground last night. The only reprieve I had was that Blake wasn’t in bio, and I wasn’t sure how to feel about that. I’d lain awake last night, replaying everything that had happened. Would Blake have let me get seriously hurt or die if I hadn’t been able to use the Source to take out the Arum? I didn’t have an answer, and that troubled me.\\n\\n Walking out of bio, Matthew called out to me. He waited until the class was empty before speaking. “How are you feeling, Katy?”\\n\\n “Good,” I said, surprised. “You?”\\n\\n Matthew smiled tightly as he leaned against the corner of his desk. “You looked like you were in pain during class. Hopefully my lecture wasn’t that bad.”\\n\\n I flushed. “No, it’s not your lecture. I slept wrong last night. Now I’m all achy.”\\n\\n He looked away. “I don’t want to keep you, but how is…”\\n\\n Now I understood why he’d really stopped me. I glanced at the open door. “Daemon’s okay. I mean, he’s as okay as he can be, I guess.”\\n\\n Matthew closed his eyes briefly. “That boy is like a son to me—both he and Dee are. I don’t want to see him doing anything crazy.”\\n\\n “He won’t,” I told him, wanting to reassure the man. And I also didn’t want Matthew knowing that Daemon was stalking Vaughn. Doubted that would go over well.\\n\\n “I hope so.” Matthew looked at me, eyes bloodshot. “Some things are best left…unknown, you know? People search for answers and they don’t always like what they get. Sometimes the truth is worse than the lie.” He turned back to his desk, messing with a stack of papers. “I hope you sleep better, Katy.”\\n\\n Realizing I’d been dismissed, I left the class weirded out to the max. Was Matthew drinking while at work? Because that was the strangest conversation I’d ever had with him. And it was the longest conversation alone with him.\\n\\n At lunch, I joined my friends and tried to forget about last night. Watching Dee and Adam make out was a good distraction. During the rare moments her mouth wasn’t attached to his, she talked about this weekend and Christmas. Whenever she looked at me, though, there was a sadness in her eyes. A gulf had developed between us, and I missed her. I missed my friends so much.\\n\\n When classes were over, I headed to my locker to grab my English book, since there was a paper due once school started back up. Just as I shoved it into my backpack, I heard my name.\\n\\n I looked up, tensing when I saw Blake. “Hey…you weren’t in bio.”\\n\\n “I came in late today,” he said, leaning against the locker beside me. “I’m not going to be able to do any practice tonight or during Christmas break. I’m visiting some family with my uncle.”\\n\\n Sweet relief flooded my system, leaving me dizzy. After last night, I wasn’t sure I wanted to continue training with Blake, despite my need to be able to defend myself. Now just wasn’t the time to talk about any of that. “That’s okay. I hope you have fun.” There was a distant, closed-off look in his eyes as he nodded. I cleared my throat. “Well, I’m going to get going. See you when—”\\n\\n “Wait.” He stepped closer. “I wanted to talk to you about last night.”\\n\\n I closed my locker door when I wanted to slam it shut. “What about it?”\\n\\n “I know you’re pissed.”\\n\\n “Yeah, I am.” I faced him. Could he really not understand why I was mad? “You risked my life last night. What if I didn’t use the Source? I’d be dead now.”\\n\\n “I wouldn’t have let him hurt you.” Sincerity filled his words and eyes. “You were safe.”\\n\\n “The bruises up and down the side of my body are telling me I got hurt.”\\n\\n He blew out an exasperated breath. “I still don’t get why you’re not happier about this. The power you showed—it’s amazing.”\\n\\n I shifted the bag off my bruised backside. “Look, can we talk about training when you get back?”\\n\\n He looked like he wanted to argue, because those green flecks in his eyes deepened and churned, but he turned his cheek and let out a harsh breath. I wanted to be out of this school, to be home in my bed, and to be away from him. Away from this boy I’d once believed was normal, once believed wanted to help me because we were alike, and now I wasn’t sure if he really cared if I survived any of his training techniques at all.\\n\\n Changing into a pair of loose sweats and a thermal when I got home, the first thing I did after that was take a nap, and I slept most of the evening away. Mom was gone when I got up, and I scrounged together a sandwich and then gathered all the books I’d gotten in the last month.\\n\\n I stacked them beside my laptop and was in the process of getting my webcam to not zoom up my nose when I felt the familiar tingles like a warm breath on the back of my neck. I glanced at the clock. It wasn’t even ten o’clock yet.\\n\\n Sighing, I got up and went to the front door, opening it before Daemon could knock. He stood there, his hand raised in midair. “I’m really beginning to dislike the fact that you know when I’m coming,” he said, frowning.\\n\\n “I thought you loved it. It enables you to be such a great stalker.”\\n\\n “I’ve already told you. I don’t stalk you.” He followed me into the living room. “I use it to keep an eye on you.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-39.html","bookId":1662,"book":{"id":1662,"title":"Onyx (Lux #2)","description":"Storyline: Onyx (Lux #2) \\n Being connected to Daemon Black sucks… \\n Thanks to his alien mojo, Daemon’s determined to prove what he feels for me is more than a product of our bizarro connection.
