{"id":45305,"no":50,"title":"chapter 50","content":"An hour later she stretched out a bare arm and tickled my ear and said: \"Would you consider marrying me?\" \"It wouldn\u0027t last six months.\" \"Well, for God\u0027s sake,\" she said, \"suppose it didn\u0027t. Wouldn\u0027t it be worth it? What do you expect from life — full coverage against all possible risks?\" \"I\u0027m forty-two years old. I\u0027m spoiled by independence. You\u0027re spoiled a little—not too much—by money.\" \"I\u0027m thirty-six. It\u0027s no disgrace to have money and no disgrace to marry it. Most of those who have it don\u0027t deserve it and don\u0027t know how to behave with it. But it won\u0027t be long. We\u0027ll have another war and at the end of that nobody will have any money—except the crooks and the chiselers. We\u0027ll all be taxed to nothing, the rest of us.\" I stroked her hair and wound some of it around my finger. \"You may be right.\" \"We could fly to Paris and have a wonderful time.\" She raised herself on an elbow and looked down at me. I could see the shine of her eyes but I couldn\u0027t read her expression. \"Do you have something against marriage?\" \"For two people in a hundred it\u0027s wonderful. The rest just work at it. After twenty years all the guy has left is a work bench in the garage. American girls are terrific. American wives take in too damn much territory. Besides—\" \"I want some champagne.\" \"Besides,\" I said, \"it would be just an incident to you. The first divorce is the only tough one. After that its merely a problem in economics. No problem to you. Ten years from now you might pass me on the street and wonder where the hell you had seen me before. If you noticed me at all.\" \"You self-sufficient, self-satisfied, self-confident, untouchable bastard. I want some champagne.\" \"This way you will remember me.\" \u0027conceited too. A mass of conceit. Slightly bruised at the moment. You think I\u0027ll remember you? No matter how many men I marry or sleep with, you think I\u0027ll remember you? Why should I?\" \"Sorry. I overstated my case. I\u0027ll get you some champagne.\" \"Aren\u0027t we sweet and reasonable?\" she said sarcastically. \"I\u0027m a rich woman, darling, and I shall be infinitely richer. I could buy you the world if it were worth buying. What have you now? An empty house to come home to, with not even a dog or cat, a small stuffy office to sit in and wait. Even if I divorced you I\u0027d never let you go back to that.\" \"How would you stop me? I\u0027m no Terry Lennox.\" \"Please. Don\u0027t let\u0027s talk about him. Nor about that golden icicle, the Wade woman. Nor about her poor drunken sunken husband. Do you want to be the only man who turned me down? What kind of pride is that? I\u0027ve paid you the greatest compliment I know how to pay. I\u0027ve asked you to marry me.\" \"You paid me a greater compliment.\" She began to cry. \"You fool, you utter fool!\" Her cheeks were wet. I could feel the tears on them. \"Suppose it lasted six months or a year or two years. What would you have lost except the dust on your office desk and the dirt on your venetian blinds and the loneliness of a pretty empty kind of life?\" \"You still want some champagne?\" \"All right.\" I pulled her close and she cried against my shoulder. She wasn\u0027t in love with me and we both knew it. She wasn\u0027t crying over me. It was just time for her to shed a few tears. Then she pulled away and I got out of bed and she went into the bathroom to fix her face. I got the champagne. When she came back she was smiling. \"I\u0027m sorry I blubbered,\" she said. \"In six months from now I won\u0027t even remember your name. Bring it into the living room. I want to see lights.\" I did what she said. She sat on the davenport as before. I put the champagne in front of her. She looked at the glass but didn\u0027t touch it. \"I\u0027ll introduce myself,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll have a drink together.\" \"Like tonight?\" \"It won\u0027t ever be like tonight again.\" She raised her glass of champagne, drank a little of it slowly, turned her body on the davenport and threw the rest in my face. Then she began to cry again. I got a handkerchief out and wiped my face off and wiped hers for her. \"I don\u0027t know why I did that,\" she said. \"But for God\u0027s sake don\u0027t say I\u0027m a woman and a woman never knows why she does anything.\" I poured some more champagne into her glass and laughed at her. She drank it slowly and then turned the other way and fell across my knees. . \"I\u0027m tired,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll have to carry me this time.\" After a while she went to sleep. In the morning she was still asleep when I got up and made coffee. I showered and shaved and dressed. She woke up then. We had breakfast together. I called a cab and carried her overnight case down the steps. We said goodbye. I watched the cab out of sight. I went back up the steps and into the bedroom and pulled the bed to pieces and remade it. There was a long dark hair on one of the pillows. There was a lump of lead at the pit of my stomach. The French have a phrase for it. The bastards have a phrase for everything and they are always right. To say goodbye is to die a little. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49394.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
