{"id":45276,"no":21,"title":"chapter 21","content":"Next morning I got up late on account of the big fee I had earned the night before. I drank an extra cup of coffee, smoked an extra cigarette, ate an extra slice of Canadian bacon, and for the three hundredth time I swore I would never again use an electric razor. That made the day normal. I hit the office about ten, picked up some odds and ends of mail, slit the envelopes and let the stuff lie on the desk. I opened the windows wide to let out the smell of dust and dinginess that collected in the night and hung in the still air, in the corners of the room, in the slats of the venetian blinds. A dead moth was spreadeagled on a corner of the desk. On the window sill a bee with tattered wings was crawling along the woodwork, buzzing in a tired remote sort of way, as if she knew it wasn\u0027t any use, she was finished, she had flown too many missions and would never get back to the hive again. I knew it was going to be one of those crazy days. Everyone has them. Days when nobody rolls in, but the loose wheels, the dingoes who park their brains with their gum, the squirrels who can\u0027t find their nuts, the mechanics who always have a gear wheel left over. The first was a big blond roughneck named Kuissenen or something Finnish like that. He jammed his massive bottom in the customer\u0027s chair and planted two wide horny hands on my desk and said he was a power-shovel operator, that he lived in Culver City, and the goddarn woman who lived next door to him was trying to poison his dog. Every morning before he let the dog out for a run in the back yard he had to search the place from fence to fence for meatballs thrown over the potato vine from next door. He\u0027d found nine of them so far and they were loaded with a greenish powder he knew was an arsenic weed killer. \"How much to watch out and catch her at it?\" He stared at me as unblinkingly as a fish in a tank. \"Why not do it yourself?\" \"I got to work for a living, mister. I\u0027m losing four twentyfive an hour just coming up here to ask.\" \"Try the police?\" \"I try the police. They might get around to it some time next year. Right now they\u0027re busy sucking up to MGM.\" \"S.P.C.A.? The Tailwaggers?\" \"What\u0027s them?\" I told him about the Tailwaggers. He was far from interested. He knew about the S.P.C.A. The S.P.C.A. could take a running jump. They couldn\u0027t see nothing smaller than a horse. \"It says on the door you\u0027re an investigator,\" he said truculently. \"Okay, go the hell out and investigate. Fifty bucks if you catch her.\" \"Sorry,\" I said. \"I\u0027m tied up. Spending a couple of weeks hiding in a gopher hole in your back yard would be out of my line anyway—even for fifty bucks.\" He stood up glowering. \"Big shot,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t need the dough, huh? Can\u0027t be bothered saving the life of a itty-bitty dog. Nuts to you, big shot.\" \"I\u0027ve got troubles too, Mr. Kuissenen.\" \"I\u0027ll twist her goddam neck if I catch her,\" he said, and I didn\u0027t doubt he could have done it. He could have twisted the hind leg off of an elephant. \"That\u0027s what makes it I want somebody else. Just because the little tike barks when a car goes by the house. Sour-faced old bitch.\" He started for the door. \"Are you sure it\u0027s the dog she\u0027s trying to poison?\" I asked his back. \"Sure I\u0027m sure.\" He was halfway to the door before the nickel dropped. He swung around fast then. \"Say that again, buster.\" I just shook my head. I didn\u0027t want to fight him. He might hit me on the head with my desk. He snorted and went out, almost taking the door with him. The next cookie in the dish was a woman, not old, not young, not clean, not too dirty, obviously poor, shabby, querulous and stupid. The girl she roomed with—in her set any woman who works out is a girl—was taking money out of her purse. A dollar here, four bits there, but it added up. She figured she was out close to twenty dollars in all. She couldn\u0027t afford it. She couldn\u0027t afford to move either. She couldn\u0027t afford a detective. She thought I ought to be willing to throw a scare into the roommate just on the telephone like, not mentioning any names It took her twenty minutes or more to tell me this. She kneaded her bag incessantly while telling it. \"Anybody you know could do that,\" I said. \"Yeah, but you bein\u0027 a dick and all.\" \"I don\u0027t have a license to threaten people I know nothing about.\" \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to tell her I been in to see you. I don\u0027t have to say it\u0027s her. Just that you\u0027re workin\u0027 on it.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t if I were you. If you mention my name she may call me up. If she does that, I\u0027ll tell her the facts.\" She stood up and slammed her shabby bag against her stomach. \"You\u0027re no gentleman,\" she said shrilly. \"Where does it say I have to be?\" She went out mumbling. After lunch I had Mr. Simpson W. Edelweiss. He had a card to prove it. He was manager of a sewing machine agency. He was a small tired-looking man about forty-eight to fifty, small hands and feet, wearing a brown suit with sleeves too long, and a stiff white collaf behind a purple tie with black diamonds on it. He sat on the edge of the chair without fidgeting and looked at me out of sad black eyes. His hair was black too and thick and rough without a sign of gray in it that I could see. He had a clipped mustache with a reddish tone. He could have passed for thirty-five if you didn\u0027t look at the backs of his hands. \"Call me Simp,\" he said. \"Everybody else does. I got it coming! I\u0027m a Jewish man married to a Gentile woman, twenty-four years of age, beautiful. She run away a couple of times before,\" He got out a photo of her and showed it to me. She might have been beautiful to him. To me she was a big sloppy-looking cow of a woman with a weak mouth. \"What\u0027s your trouble, Mr. Edelweiss? I don\u0027t do divorce business.\" I tried to give him back the photo. He waved it away. \"The client is always mister to me,\" I added. \"Until he has told me a few dozen lies anyway.\" He smiled. \"Lies I got no use for. It\u0027s not a divorce matter. I just want Mabel back again. But she don\u0027t come back until I find her. Maybe it\u0027s a kind of game with her.\" He told me about her, patiently, without rancor. She drank, she played around, she wasn\u0027t a very good wife by his standards, but he could have been brought up too strict. She had a heart as big as a house, he said, and he loved her. He didn\u0027t kid himself he was any dreamboat, just a steady worker bringing home the pay check. They had a joint bank account. She had drawn it all out, but he was prepared for that. He had a pretty good idea who she had lit out with, and if he was right the man would clean her out and leave her stranded. \"Name of Kerrigan,\" he said, \"Monroe Kerrigan. I don\u0027t aim to knock the Catholics. There is plenty of bad Jews too. This Kerrigan is a barber when he works. I ain\u0027t knocking barbers either. But a lot of them are drifters and horse players. Not real steady.\" \"Won\u0027t you hear from her when she is cleaned out?\" \"She gets awful ashamed. She might hurt herself.\" \"It\u0027s a Missing Persons job, Mr. Edelweiss. You should go down and make a report.\" \"No. I\u0027m not knocking the police, but I don\u0027t want it that way. Mabel would be humiliated.\" The world seemed to be full of people Mr. Edelweiss was not knocking. He put some money on the desk. \"Two hundred dollars,\" he said. \"Down payment. I\u0027d rather do it my way.\" \"It will happen again,\" I said. \"Sure.\" He shrugged and spread his hands gently. \"But twenty-four years old and me almost fifty. How could it be different? She\u0027ll settle down after a while. Trouble is, no kids. She can\u0027t have kids. A Jew likes \u0027to have a family. So Mabel knows that. She\u0027s humiliated.\" \"You\u0027re a very forgiving man, Mr. Edelweiss.\" \"Well I ain\u0027t a Christian,\" he said. \"And I\u0027m not knocking Christians, you understand. But with me it\u0027s real. I don\u0027t just say it. I do it. Oh, I almost forgot the most important.\" He got out a picture postcard and pushed it across the desk after the money, \"From Honolulu she sends it. Money goes fast in Honolulu. One of my uncles had a jewelry business there. Retired now. Lives in Seattle.\" I picked the photd up again. \"I\u0027ll have to farm this one out,\" I told him. \"And I\u0027ll have to have this copied.\" \"I could hear you saying that, Mr. Marlowe, before I got here. So I come prepared.\" He took out an envelope and it contained five more prints. \"I got Kerrigan too, but only a snapshot.\" He went into another pocket and gave me another envelope. I looked at Kerrigan. He had a smooth dishonest face that did not surprise me. Three copies of Kerrigan. Mr. Simpson W. Edelweiss gave me another card which had on it his name, his residence, his telephone number. He said he hoped it would not cost too much but that he would respond at once to any demand for further funds and he hoped to hear from me. \"Two hundred ought to pretty near do it if she\u0027s still in Honolulu,\" I said. \"What I need now is a detailed physical description of both parties that I can put into a telegram. Height, weight, age, coloring, any noticeable scars or other identifying marks, what clothes she was wearing and had with her, and how much money was in the account she cleaned out. If you\u0027ve been through this before, Mr. Edelweiss, you will know what I want.\" \"I got a peculiar feeling about this Kerrigan. Uneasy.\" I spent another half hour milking him and writing things down. Then he stood up quietly, shook hands quietly, bowed and left the office quietly. \"Tell Mabel everything is fine,\" he said as he went out. It turned out to be routine, I sent a wire to an agency in Honolulu and followed it with an airmail containing the photos and whatever information I had left out of the wire. They found her working as a chambermaid\u0027s helper in a luxury hotel, scrubbing bathtubs and bathroom floors and so on. Kerrigan had done just what Mr. Edelweiss expected, cleaned her out while she was asleep and skipped, leaving her stuck with the hotel bill. She pawned a ring which Kerrigan couldn\u0027t have taken without violence, and got enough out-of it to pay the hotel but not enough to buy her way home. So Edelweiss hopped a plane and went after her. He was too good for her. I sent him a bill for twenty dollars and the cost of a long telegram. The Honolulu agency grabbed the two hundred. With a portrait of Madison in my office safe I could afford to be underpriced. So passed a day in the life of a P.I. Not exactly a typical day but not totally untypical either. What makes a man stay with it nobody knows. You don\u0027t get rich, you don\u0027t often have much fun. Sometimes you get beaten up or shot at or tossed into the jailhouse. Once in a long while you get dead. Every other month you decide to give it up and find some sensible occupation while you can still walk without shaking your head. Then the door buzzer rings and you open the inner door to the waiting room and there stands a new face with a new problem, a new load of grief, and a small piece of money. \"Come in, Mr. Thingummy. What can I do for you?\" There must be a reason. Three days later in the shank of the afternoon Eileen Wade called me up, and asked me to come around to the house for a drink the next evening. They were having a few friends in for cocktails. Roger would like to see me and thank me adequately. And would I please send in a bill? \"You don\u0027t owe me anything, Mrs. Wade. What little I did I got paid for.\" \"I must have looked very silly acting Victorian about it,\" she said. \"A kiss doesn\u0027t seem to mean much nowadays. You will come, won\u0027t you?\" \"I guess so. Against my better judgment.\" \"Roger is quite well again. He\u0027s working.\" \"Good.\" \"You sound very solemn today. I guess you take life pretty seriously.\" \"Now and then. Why?\" She laughed very gently and said goodbye and hung up. I sat there for a while taking life seriously. Then I tried to think of something funny so that I could have a great big laugh. Neither way worked, so I got Terry Lennox\u0027s letter of farewell out of the safe and reread it. It reminded me that I had never gone to Victor\u0027s for that gimlet he asked me to drink for him. It was just about the right time of day for the bar to be quiet, the way he would have liked it himself, if he had been around to go with me. I thought of him with a vague sadness and with a puckering bitterness too. When I got to Victor\u0027s I almost kept going. Almost, but not quite. I had too much of his money. He had made a fool of me but he had paid well for the privilege. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49365.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
