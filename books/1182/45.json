{"id":45300,"no":45,"title":"chapter 45","content":"Back in my own house on the sixth floor of the Cahuenga Building I went through my regular double play with the morning mail. Mail slot to desk to wastebasket, Tinker to Evers to Chance. I blew a clear space on the top of the desk and unrolled the photostat on it. I had rolled it so as not to make creases. I read it over again. It was detailed enough and reasonable enough to satisfy any open mind. Eileen Wade had killed Terry\u0027s wife in a fit of jealous fury and later when the opportunity was set up she had killed Roger because she was sure he knew. The gun fired into the ceiling of his room that night had been part of the setup. The unanswered and forever unanswerable question was why Roger Wade had stood still and let her put it over. He must have known how it would end. So he had written himself off and didn\u0027t care. Words were his business, he had words for almost everything, but none for this. \"I have forty-six demerol tablets left from my last prescription,\" she wrote. \"I now intend to take them all and lie down on the bed. The door is locked. In a very short time I shall be beyond saving. This, Howard, is to be understood. What I write is in the presence of death. Every word is true. I have no regrets—except possibly that I could not have found them together and killed them together. I have no regrets for Paul whom you have heard called Terry Lennox. He was the empty shell of the man I loved and married. He meant nothing to me. When I saw him that afternoon for the only time after he came back from the war—at first I didn\u0027t know him. Then I did and he knew me at once. He should have died young in the snow of Norway, my lover that I gave to death. He came back a friend of gamblers, the husband of a rich whore, a spoiled and ruined man, and probably some kind of crook in his past life. Time makes everything mean and shabby and wrinkled. The tragedy of life, Howard, is not that the beautiful things die young, but that they grow old and mean. It will not happen to me. Goodbye, Howard.\" I put the photostat in the desk and locked it up. It was time for lunch but I wasn\u0027t in the mood. I got the office bottle out of the deep drawer and poured a slug and then got the phone book off the hook at the desk and looked up the number of the Journal. I dialed it and asked the girl for Lonnie Morgan. \"Mr. Morgan doesn\u0027t come in until around four o\u0027clock. You might try the press room at the City Hall.\" I called that. And I got him. He remembered me well enough. \"You\u0027ve been a pretty busy guy, I heard.\" \"I\u0027ve got something for you, if you want it. I don\u0027t think you want it.\" \"Yeah?\u0027 Such as?\" \"A photostat of a confession to two murders.\" \"Where are you?\" I told him. He wanted more information. I wouldn\u0027t give him any over the phone. He said he wasn\u0027t on a crime beat. I said he was still a newspaperman and on the only independent paper in the city. He still wanted to argue. \"Where did you get this whatever it is? How do I know it\u0027s worth my time?\" \"The D.A.\u0027s office has the original. They won\u0027t release it. It breaks open a couple of things they hid behind the icebox.\" \"I\u0027ll call you. I have to check with the brass.\" We hung up. I went to the drugstore and ate a chicken salad sandwich and drank some coffee. The coffee was overtrained and the sandwich was as full of rich flavor as a piece torn off an old shirt. Americans will eat anything if it is toasted and held together with a couple of toothpicks and has lettuce sticking out of the sides, preferably a little wilted. At three-thirty or so Lonnie Morgan came in to see me. He was the same long thin wiry piece of tired and expressionless humanity as he had been the night he drove me home from the jailhousè. He shook hands listlessly and rooted in a crumpled pack of cigarettes. \"Mr. Sherman — that\u0027s the M.E. — said I could look you up and see what you have.\" \"It\u0027s off the record unless you agree to my terms.\" I unlocked the desk and handed him the photostat. He read the four pages rapidly and then again more slowly. He looked very excited—about as excited as a mortician at a cheap funeral. \"Gimme the phone.\" I pushed it across the desk. He dialed, waited, and said: \"This is Morgan. Let me talk to Mr. Sherman.\" He waited and got some other female and then got his party and asked him to ring back on another line. He hung up and sat holding the telephone in his lap with the forefinger pressing the button down. It rang again and he lifted the receiver to his ear. \"Here it is, Mr. Sherman.\" He read slowly and distinctly. At the end there was a pause. Then, \"One moment, sir.\" He lowered the phone and glanced across the desk. \"He wants to know how you got hold of this.\" I reached across the desk and took the photostat away from him. \"Tell him it\u0027s none of his goddam business how I got hold of it. Where is something else. The stamp on the back of the pages show that.\" \"Mr. Sherman, it\u0027s apparently an official document of the Los Angeles Sheriff\u0027s office. I guess we could check its authenticity easy enough. Also there\u0027s a price.\" He listened some more and then said;: \"Yes, sir. Right here.\" He pushed the phone across the desk. \"Wants to talk to you.\" It was a brusque authoritative voice., \"Mr. Marlowe, what are your terms? And remember the Journal is the only paper in Los Angeles which would even consider touching this matter.\" \"You didn\u0027t do much on the Lennox case, Mr. Sherman.\" \"I realize that. But at that time it was purely a question of scandal for scandal\u0027s sake. There was no question of who was guilty. What we have now, if your document is genuine, is something quite different. What are your terms?\" \"You print the confession in full in the form of a photographic reproduction. Or you don\u0027t print it at all.\" \"It will be verified. You understand that?\" \"I don\u0027t see how, Mr. Sherman. If you ask the D.A. he will either deny it or give it to every paper in town. He\u0027d have to. if you ask the Sheriff\u0027s office they will put it up to the D.A.\" \"Don\u0027t worry about that, Mr. Marlowe. We have ways. How about your terms?\" \"I just told you.\" \"Oh. You don\u0027t expect to be paid?\" \"Not with money.\" \"Well, you know your own business, I suppose. May I have Morgan again?\" I gave the phone back to Lonnie Morgan. He spoke briefly and hung up. \"He agrees,\" he said. \"I take that photostat and he checks it. He\u0027ll do what you say. Reduced to half size it will take about half of page lA.\" I gave him back the photostat. He held it and pulled at the tip of his long nose. \"Mind my saying I think you\u0027re a damn fool?\" \"I agree with you.\" \"You can still change your mind.\" \"Nope. Remember that night you drove me home from the City Bastille? You said I had a friend to say goodbye to. I\u0027ve never really said goodbye to him. If you publish this photostat, that will be it. It\u0027s been a long time—a long, long time.\" \"Okay, chum.\" He grinned crookedly. \"But I still think you\u0027re a damn fool. Do I have to tell you why?\" \"Tell me anyway.\" \"I know more about you than you think. That\u0027s the frustrating part of newspaper work. You always know so many things you can\u0027t use. You get cynical. If this confession is printed in the Journal, a lot of people will be sore. The D.A., the coroner, the Sheriff\u0027s crowd, an influential and powerful private citizen named Potter, and a couple of toughies called Menendez and Starr. You\u0027ll probably end up in the hospital Or in jail again,\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Think what you like, pal. I\u0027m telling you what I think. The D.A. will be sore because he dropped a blanket on the Lennox case. Even if the suicide and confession of Lennox made him look justified, a lot of people will want to know how Lennox, an innocent man, came to make a confession, how he got dead, did he really commit suicide or was he helped, why was there no investigation into the circumstances, and how come the whole thing died so fast. Also, if he has the original of this photostat he will think he has been double-crossed by the Sheriff\u0027s people.\" \"You don\u0027t have to print the identifying stamp on the back.\" \"We won\u0027t. We\u0027re pals with the Sheriff. We think he\u0027s a straight guy. We don\u0027t blame him because he can\u0027t stop guys like Menendez. Nobody can stop gambling as long as it\u0027s legal in all forms in some places and legal in some forms in all places. You stole this from the Sheriff\u0027s office. I don\u0027t know how you got away with it. Want to tell me?\" \"Okay. The coroner will be sore because he buggered up the Wade suicide. The D.A. helped him with that too. Harlan Potter will be sore because something is reopened that he used a lot of power to close up. Menendez and Starr will be sore for reasons I\u0027m not sure of, but I know you got warned off. And when those boys get sore at somebody he gets hurt. You\u0027re apt to get the treatment Big Willie Magoon got.\" \"Magoon was probably getting too heavy for his job.\" \u0027Why?\" Morgan drawled. \"Because those boys have to make it stick. If they take the trouble to tell you to lay off, you lay off. you don\u0027t and they let you get away with it they look weak. The hard boys that run the business, the big wheels, the board of directors, don\u0027t have any use for weak people. They\u0027re dangerous. And then there\u0027s Chris Mady.\" \"He just about runs Nevada, I heard.\" \"You heard right, chum. Mady is a nice guy but he knows what\u0027s right for Nevada. The rich hoodlums that operate in Reno and Vegas are very careful not to annoy Mr. Mady. If they did, their taxes would go up fast and their police co-operation would go down the same way. Then the top guys back East would decide some changes were necessary. An operator who can\u0027t get along with Chris Mady ain\u0027t operating correctly. Get him the hell out of there and put somebody else in. Getting him out of there means only one thing to them. Out in a wooden box.\" \"They never heard of me,\" I said. Morgan frowned and whipped an arm up and down in a meaningless gesture, \"They don\u0027t have to. Mady\u0027s estate on the Nevada side of Tahoe is right next to Harlan Potter\u0027s estate. Could be they say hello once in a while. Gould be some character that is on Mady\u0027s payroll hears from another guy on Potter\u0027s payroll that a punk named Marlowe is buzzing too loud about things that are not any of his business. Could be that this passing remark gets passed on down to where the phone rings in some apartment in L.A. and a guy with large muscles gets a hint to go out and exercise himself and two or three of his friends. If somebody wants you knocked off or smashed, the muscle men don\u0027t have to have it explained why. It\u0027s mere routine to them. No hard feelings at all. Just sit still while we break your arm. You want this back?\" He held out the photostat. \"You know what I want,\" I said. Morgan stood up slowly and put the photostat in his inside pocket. \"I could be wrong,\" he said. \"You may know more about it than I do. I wouldn\u0027t know how a man like Harlan Potter looks at things.\" \"With a scowl,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve met him. But he wouldn\u0027t operate with a goon squad. He couldn\u0027t reconcile it with his opinion of how he wants to live.\" \"For my money,\" Morgan said sharply, \"stopping a murder investigation with a phone call and stopping itby knocking off the witnesses is just a question of method. See you around—I hope.\" He drifted out of the office like something blown by the wind.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49389.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
