{"id":45261,"no":6,"title":"chapter 6","content":"It\u0027s a long drag back from Tijuana and one of the dullest drives in the state. Tijuana is nothing; all they want there is the buck. The kid who sidles over to your car and looks at you with big wistful eyes and says, \"One dime, please, mister,\" will try to sell you his sister in the next sentence. Tijuana is not Mexico. No border town is anything but a border town, just as no waterfront is anything but a waterfront. San Diego? One of the most beautiful harbors in the world and nothing in it but navy and a few fishing boats. At night it is fairyland. The swell is as gentle as an old lady singing hymns. But Marlowe has to get home and count the spoons. The road north is as monotonous as a sailor\u0027s chantey. You go through a town, down a hill, along a stretch of beach, through a town, down a hill, along a stretch of beach. It was two o\u0027clock when I got back and they were waiting for me in a dark sedan with no police tags, no red light, only the double antenna, and not only police cars have those. I was halfway up the steps before they came out of it and yelled at me, the usual couple in the usual suits, with the usual stony leisure of movement, as if the world was waiting hushed and silent for them to tell it what to do. \"Your name Marlowe? We want to talk to you.\" He let me see the glint of a badge. For all I caught of it he might have been Pest Control. He was gray blond and looked sticky. His partner was tall, good-looking, neat, and had a precise nastiness about him, a goon with an education. They had watching and waiting eyes, patient and careful eyes, cool disdainful eyes, cops\u0027 eyes. They get them at the passing-out parade at the police school. \"Sergeant Green, Central Homicide. This is Detective Dayton.\" I went on up and unlocked the door. You don\u0027t shake hands with big city cops. That close is too close. They sat in the living room. I opened the windows and the breeze whispered. Green did the talking. \"Man named Terry Lennox. Know him, huh?\" \"We have a drink together once in a while. He lives in Encino, married money. I\u0027ve never been where he lives.\" \"Once in a while,\" Green said. \"How often would that be?\" \"It\u0027s a vague expression. I meant it that way. It could be once a week or once in two months.\" \"Met his wife?\" \"Once, very briefly, before they were married.\" \"You saw him last when and where?\" I took a pipe off the end table and filled it. Green leaned forward close to me. The tall lad sat farther back holding a ballpoint poised over a red-edged pad. \"This is where I say, \u0027What\u0027s this all about?\u0027 and you say, \u0027We ask the questions.\u0027\" \"So you just answer them, huh?\" I lit the pipe. The tobacco was a little too moist. It took me some time to light it properly and three matches. \"I got time,\" Green said, \"but I already used up a lot of it waiting around. So snap it up, mister. We know who you are, And you know we ain\u0027t here to work up an appetite.\" \"I was just thinking,\" I said. \"We used to go to Victor\u0027s fairly often, and not so often to The Green Lantern and The Bull and Bear—that\u0027s the place down at the end of the Strip that tries to look like an English inn—\" \"Quit stalling.\" \"Who\u0027s dead?\" I asked. Detective Dayton spoke up. He had a hard, mature, don\u0027t-try-to-fool-with-me voice. \"Just answer the questions, Marlowe. We are conducting a routine investigation. That\u0027s all you need to know.\" Maybe I was tired and irritable. Maybe I felt a little guilty. I could learn to hate this guy without even knowing him. I could just look at him across the width of a cafeteria and want to kick his teeth in. \"Shove it, Jack,\" I said. \"Keep that guff for the juvenile bureau. It\u0027s a horse laugh even to them.\" Green chuckled. Nothing changed in Dayton\u0027s face that you could put a finger on-but he suddenly looked ten years older and twenty years nastier. The breath going through his nose whistled faintly. \"He passed the bar examination,\" Green said. \"You can\u0027t fool around with Dayton.\" I got up slowly and went over to the bookshelves. I took down the bound copy of the California Penal Code. I held it out to Dayton. \"Would you kindly find me the section that says I have to answer the questions?\" He was holding himself very still. He was going to slug me and we both knew it. But he was going to wait for the break. Which meant that he didn\u0027t trust Green to back him up if he got out of line. He said: \"Every citizen has to co-operate with the police. In all ways, even by physical action, and especially by answering any questions of a non-incriminating nature the police think it necessary to ask.\" His voice saying this was hard and bright and smooth. \"It works out that way,\" I said. \"Mostly by a process of direct or indirect intimidation. In law no such obligation exists. Nobody has to tell the police anything, any time, anywhere.\" \"Aw shut up,\" Green said impatiently. \"You\u0027re crawfishing and you know it. Sit down. Lennox\u0027s wife has been murdered. In a guest house at their place in Encino. Lennox has skipped out. Anyway he can\u0027t be found. So we\u0027re looking for a suspect in a murder case. That satisfy you?\" I threw the book in a chair and went back to the couch across the table from Green. \"So why come to me?\" I asked. \"I\u0027ve never been near the house. I told you that.\" Green patted his thighs, up and down, up and down. He grinned at me quietly. Dayton was motionless in the chair. His eyes ate me. \"On account of your phone number was written on a pad in his room during the past twenty-four hours,\" Green said. \"It\u0027s a date pad and yesterday was torn off but you could see the impression on today\u0027s page. We don\u0027t know when he called you up. We don\u0027t know where he went or why or when. But we got to ask, natch.\" \"Why in the guest house?\" I asked, not expecting him to answer, but he did. He blushed a little. \"Seems she went there pretty often. At night. Had visitors. The help can see down through the trees where the lights show. Cars come and go, sometimes late, sometimes very late. Too much is enough, huh? Don\u0027t kid yourself. Lennox is our boy. He went down that way about one in the A.M. The butler happened to see. He come back alone, maybe twenty minutes later. After that nothing. The lights stayed on. This morning no Lennox. The butler goes down by the guest house. The dame is as naked as a mermaid on the bed and let me tell you he don\u0027t recognize her by her face. She practically ain\u0027t got one. Beat to pieces with a bronze statuette of a monkey.\" \"Terry Lennox wouldn\u0027t do anything like that,\" I said. \"Sure she cheated on him. Old stuff. She always had. They\u0027d been divorced and remarried. I don\u0027t suppose it made him happy but why should he go crazy over it now?\" \"Nobody knows that answer,\" Green said patiently. \"It happens all the time. Men and women both. A guy takes it and takes it and takes it. Then he don\u0027t. He probably don\u0027t know why himself, why at that particular instant he goes berserk. Only he does, and somebody\u0027s dead. So we got business to do. So we ask you one simple question. So quit horsing around or we take you in.\" \"He\u0027s not going to tell you, Sergeant,\" Dayton said acidly. \"He read that law book. Like a lot of people that read a law book he thinks the law is in it.\" \"You make the notes,\" Green said, \"and leave your brains alone. If you\u0027re real good we\u0027ll let you sing \u0027Mother Machree\u0027 at the police smoker.\" \"The hell with you, Sarge, if I may say so with proper respect for your rank.\" \"Let\u0027s you and him fight,\" I said to Green. \"I\u0027ll catch him when he drops.\" Dayton laid his note pad and ball-point aside very carefully. He stood up with a bright gleam in his eyes. He walked over and stood in front of me. \"On your feet, bright boy. Just because I went to college don\u0027t make me take any guff from a nit like you.\" I started to get up. I was still off balance when he hit me. He hooked me with a neat left and crossed it. Bellsrang, but not for dinner. I sat down hard and shook my head. Dayton was still there. He was smiling now. \"Let\u0027s try again,\" he said. \"You weren\u0027t set that time. It wasn\u0027t really kosher.\" I looked at Green. He was looking at his thumb as if studying a hangnail. I didn\u0027t move or speak, waiting for him to look up. If I stood up again, Dayton would slug me again. He might slug me again anyhow. But if I stood up and he slugged me, I would take him to pieces, because the blows proved he was strictly a boxer. He put them in the right place but it would take a lot of them to wear me down. Green said almost absently: \"Smart work, Billy boy. You gave the man exactly what he wanted. Clam juice.\" Then he looked up and said mildly: \"Once more, for the record, Marlowe. Last time you saw Terry Lennox, where and how and what was talked about, and where did you come from just now. Yes—or no?\" Dayton was standing loosely, nicely balanced. There was a soft sweet sheen in his eyes. \"How about the other guy?\" I asked, ignoring him. \"What other guy was that?\" \"In the hay, in the guest house. No clothes on. You\u0027re not saying she had to go down there to play solitaire,\" \"That comes later—when we get the husband.\" \"Fine. If it\u0027s not too much trouble when you already have a patsy.\" \"You don\u0027t talk, we take you in, Marlowe.\" \"As a material witness?\" \"As a material my foot. As a suspect. Suspicion of accessory after the fact of murder. Helping a suspect escape. My guess is you took the guy somewhere. And rightnow a guess is all I need. The skipper is tough these days. He knows the rule book but he gets absent-minded. This could be a misery for you. One way or another we get a statement from you. The harder it is to get, the surer we are we need it.\" \"That\u0027s a lot of crap to him,\" Dayton said. \"He knows the book.\" \"It\u0027s a lot of crap to everybody,\" Green said calmly. \"But it still works. Come on, Marlowe. I\u0027m blowing the whistle on you.\" \"Okay,\" I said. \"Blow it. Terry Lennox was my friend. I\u0027ve got a reasonable amount of sentiment invested in him. Enough not to spoil it just because a cop says come through, You\u0027ve got a case against him, maybe far more than I hear from you. Motive, opportunity, and the fact that he skipped out. The motive is old stuff, long neutralized, almost part of the deal. I don\u0027t admire that kind of deal, but that\u0027s the kind of guy he is—a little weak and very gentle. The rest of it means nothing except that if he knew she was dead he knew he was a sitting duck for you. At the inquest if they have one and if they call me, I\u0027ll have to answer questions. I don\u0027t have to answer yours. I can see you\u0027re a nice guy, Green. Just as I can see your partner is just another goddam badge flasher with a power complex. If you want to get me in a real jam, let him hit me again. I\u0027ll break his goddam pencil for him.\" Green stood up and looked at me sadly. Dayton hadn\u0027t moved. He was a one-shot tough guy. He had to have time out to pat his back. \"I\u0027ll use the phone,\" Green said. \"But I know what answer I\u0027ll get. You\u0027re a sick chicken, Marlowe. A very sick chicken. Get the hell outa my way.\" This last to Dayton. Dayton turned and went back and picked up his pad. Green crossed to the phone and lifted it slowly, his plain face creased with the long slow thankless grind. That\u0027s the trouble with cops. You\u0027re all set to hate their guts and then you meet one that goes human on you. The Captain said to bring me in, and rough. They put handcuffs on me. They didn\u0027t search the house, which seemed careless of them. Possibly they figured I would be too experienced to have anything there that could be dangerous to me. In which they were wrong. Because if they had made any kind of job of it they would have found Terry Lennox\u0027s car keys. And when the car was found, as it would be sooner or later, they would fit the keys to it and know he had been in my company. Actually, as it turned out, that meant nothing. The car was never found by any police. It was stolen sometime in the night, driven most probably to El Paso, fitted with new keys and forged papers, and put on the market eventually in Mexico City. The procedure is routine. Mostly the money comes back in the form of heroin. Part of the good-neighbor policy, as the hoodlums see it. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49350.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
