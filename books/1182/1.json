{"id":45256,"no":1,"title":"chapter 1","content":"The first time I laid eyes on Terry Lennox he was drunk in a Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith outside the terrace of The Dancers. The parking lot attendant had brought the car out and he was still holding the door open because Terry Lennox\u0027s left foot was still dangling outside, as if he had forgotten he had one. He had a young-looking face but his hair was bone white. You could tell by his eyes that he was plastered to the hairline, but otherwise he looked like any other nice young guy in a dinner jacket who had been spending too much money in a joint that exists for that purpose and for no other. There was a girl beside him. Her hair was a lovely shade of dark red and she had a distant smile on her lips and over her shoulders she had a blue mink that almost made the Rolls-Royce look like just another automobile. It didn\u0027t quite. Nothing can. The attendant was the usual half-tough character in a white coat with the name of the restaurant stitched across the front of it in red. He was getting fed up. \"Look, mister,\" he said with an edge to his voice, \"would you mind a whole lot pulling your leg into the car so I can kind of shut the door? Or should I open it all the way so you can fall out?\" The girl gave him a look which ought to have stuck at least four inches out of his back. It didn\u0027t bother him enough to give him the shakes. At The Dancers they get the sort of people that disillusion you about what a lot of golfing money can do for the personality. A low-swung foreign speedster with no top drifted into the parking lot and a man got out of it and used the dash lighter on a long cigarette. He was wearing a pullover check shirt, yellow slacks, and riding boots. He strolled off trailing douds of incense, not even bothering to look towards the Rolls-Royce. He probably thought it was corny. At the foot of the steps up to the terrace he paused to stick a monode in his eye. The girl said with a nice burst of charm: \"I have a wonderful idea, darling. Why don\u0027t we just take a cab to your place and get your convertible out? It\u0027s such a wonderful night for a run up the coast to Montecito. I know some people there who are throwing a dance around the pool.\" The white-haired lad said politely: \"Awfully sorry, but I don\u0027t have it any more. I was compelled to sell it.\" From his voice and articulation you wouldn\u0027t have known he had had anything stronger than orange juice to drink. \"Sold it, darling? How do you mean?\" She slid away from him along the seat but her voice slid away a lot farther than that. \"I mean I had to,\" he said. \"For eating money.\" \"Oh, I see.\" A slice of spumoni wouldn\u0027t have melted on her now. The attendant had the white-haired boy right where he could reach him—in a low-income bracket. \"Look, buster,\" he said, \"I\u0027ve got to put a car away. See you some more some other time—maybe.\" He let the door swing open. The drunk promptly slid off the seat and landed on the blacktop on the seat of his pants. So I went over and dropped my nickel. I guess it\u0027s always a mistake to interfere with a drunk. Even if he knows and likes you he is always liable to haul off and poke you in the teeth. I got him under the arms and got him up on his feet. \"Thank you so very much,\" he said politely. The girl slid under the wheel. \"He gets so goddam English when he\u0027s loaded,\" she said in a stainless-steel voice. \"Thanks for catching him.\" \"I\u0027ll get him in the back of the car,\" I said. \"I\u0027m terribly sorry. I\u0027m late for an engagement.\" She let the clutch in and the Rolls started to glide. \"He\u0027s just a lost dog,\" she added with a cool smile. \"Perhaps you can find a home for him. He\u0027s housebroken— more or less.\" And the Rolls ticked down the entrance driveway onto Sunset Boulevard, made a right turn, and was gone. I was looking after her when the attendant came back. And I was still holding the man up and he was now sound asleep. \"Well, that\u0027s one way of doing it,\" I told the white Wat. \"Sure,\"-he said cynically. \"Why waste it on a lush? Them curves and all.\" \"You know him?\" \"I heard the dame call him Terry. Otherwise I don\u0027t know him from a cow\u0027s caboose. But I only been here two weeks.\" \"Get my car, will you?\" I gave him the ticket. By the time he brought my Olds over I felt as if I was holding up a sack of lead. The white coat helped me get him into the front seat. The customer opened an eye and thanked us and went to sleep again. \"He\u0027s the politest drunk I ever met,\" I said to the white coat. \"They come all sizes and shapes and all kinds of manners,\" he said. \"And they\u0027re all bums. Looks like this one had a plastic job one time.\" \"Yeah.\" I gave him a dollar and he thanked me. He was right about the plastic job. The right side of my new friend\u0027s face was frozen and whitish and seamed with thin fine scars. The skin had a glossy look along the scars. A plastic job and a pretty drastic one. \"Whatcha aim to do with him?\" \"Take him home and sober him up enough to tell me where he lives.\" The white coat grinned at me. \"Okay, sucker. If it was me, I\u0027d just drop him in the gutter and keep going. Them booze hounds just make a man a lot of trouble for no fun. I got a philosophy about them things. The way the competition is nowadays a guy has to save his strength to protect hisself in the clinches.\" \"I can see you\u0027ve made a big success out of it,\" I said. He looked puzzled and then he started to get mad, but by that time I was in the car and moving. He was partly right of course. Terry Lennox made me plenty of trouble. But after all that\u0027s my line of work. I was living that year in a house on Yucca Avenue in the Laurel Canyon district. It was a small hillside house on a dead-end street with a long flight of redwood steps to the front door and a grove of eucalyptus trees across the way. It was furnished, and it belonged to a woman who had gone to Idaho to live with her widowed daughter for a while. The rent was low, partly because the owner wanted to be able to come back on short notice, and partly because of the steps. She was getting too old to face them every time she came home. I got the drunk up them somehow. He was eager to help but his legs were rubber and he kept falling asleep in the middle of an apologetic sentence. I got the door unlocked and dragged him inside and spread him on the l.ng couch, threw a rug over him and let him go back to sleep, He snored like a grampus for an hour. Then he came awake all of a sudden and wanted to go to the bathroom. When he came back he looked at me peeringly, squinting his eyes, and wanted to know where the hell he was. I told him. He said his name was Terry Lennox and that he lived in an apartment in Westwood and no one was waiting up for him. His voice was dear and unslurred. He said he could handle a cup of black coffee. When I brought it he sipped it carefully holding the saucer close under the cup. \"How come I\u0027m here?\" he asked, looking around. \"You squiffed out at The Dancers in a Rolls. Your girl friend ditched you.\" \"Quite,\" he said. \"No doubt she was entirely justified.\" \"You English?\" \"I\u0027ve lived there. I wasn\u0027t born there. If I might call a taxi, I\u0027ll take myself off.\" \"You\u0027ve got one waiting.\" He made the steps on his own going down. He didn\u0027t say much on the way to Westwood, except that it was very kind of me and he was sorry to be such a nuisance. He had probably said it so often and to so many people that it was automatic. His apartment was small and stuffy and impersonal. He might have moved in that afternoon. On a coffee table in front of a hard green davenport there was a half empty Scotch bottle and melted ice in a bowl and three -empty fizzwater bottles and two glasses and a glass ash tray loaded with stubs with and without lipstick. There wasn\u0027t a photograph or a personal artide of any kind in the place. It might have been a hotel room rented for a meeting or a farewell, for a few drinks and a talk, for a roll in the hay. It didn\u0027t look like a place where anyone lived. He offered me a drink. I said no thanks. I didn\u0027t sit down. When I left he thanked me some more, but not as if I had dimbed a mountain for him, nor as if it was nothing at all. He was a little shaky and a little shy but polite as hell. He stood in the open door until the automatic elevator came up and I got into it. Whatever he didn\u0027t have he had manners. He hadn\u0027t mentioned the girl again, Also, he hadn\u0027t mentioned that he had no job and no prospects and that almost his last dollar had gone into paying the check at The Dancers for a bit of high class fluff that couldn\u0027t stick around long enough to make sure he didn\u0027t get tossed in the sneezer by some prowl car boys, or rolled by a tough hackie and dumped out in a vacant lot, On the way down in the elevator I had an impulse to go back up and take the Scotch bottle away from him. But it wasn\u0027t any of my business and it never does any good anyway. They always find a way to get it if they have to have it. I drove home chewing my lip. I\u0027m supposed to be tough but there was something about the guy that got me. I didn\u0027t know what it was unless it was the white hair and the scarred face and the clear voice and the politeness. Maybe that was enough. There was no reason why I should ever see him again. He was just a lost dog, like the girl said.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49345.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
