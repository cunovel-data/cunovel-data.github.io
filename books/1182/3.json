{"id":45258,"no":3,"title":"chapter 3","content":"Three days before Christmas I got a cashier\u0027s check on a Las Vegas bank for $100. A note written on hotel paper came with it. He thanked me, wished me a Merry Christmas and all kinds of luck and said he hoped to see me again soon. The kick was in a postscript. \"Sylvia and I are starting a second honeymoon. She says please don\u0027t be sore at her for wanting to try again.\" I caught the rest of it in one of those snob columns in the society section of the paper. I don\u0027t read them often, only when I run out of things to dislike. \"Your correspondent is all fluttery at the news that Terry and Sylvia Lennox have rehitched at Las Vegas, the dears. She\u0027s the younger daughter of multimillionaire Harlan Potter of San Francisco and Pebble Beach, of course. Sylvia is having Marcel and Jeanne Duhaux redecorate the entire mansion in Encino from basement to roof in the most devastatingly dernier cri. Curt Westerheym, Sylvia\u0027s last but one, my dears, gave her the little eighteen-room shack for a wedding present, you may remember. And whatever happened to Curt, you ask? Or do you? St. Tropez has the answer, and permanently I hear. Also a certain very, very blue-blooded French duchess with two perfectly adorable children. And what does Harlan Potter think of the remarriage, you may also ask? One can only guess. Mr. Potter is one person who but never gives an interview. How exclusive can you get, darlings?\" I threw the paper into the corner and turned on the TV set. After the society page dog vomit even the wrestlers looked good. But the facts were probably right. On the society page they better be. I had a mental picture of the kind of eighteen-room shack that would go with a few of the Potter millions, not to mention decorations by Duhaux in the last subphallic symbolism. But I had no mental picture at all of Terry Lennox loafing around one of the swimming pools in Bermuda shorts and phoning the butler by R/T to ice the champagne and get the grouse atoasting. There was no reason why I should have. If the guy wanted to be somebody\u0027s woolly bear, it was no skin off my teeth. I just didn\u0027t want to see him again. But I knew I would—if only on account of his goddamn gold-plated pigskin suitcase. It was five o\u0027clock of a wet March evening when he walked into my down-at-heels brain emporium. He looked changed. Older, very sober and severe and beautifully calm. He looked like a guy who had learned to roll with a punch. He wore an oyster-white raincoat and gloves and no hat and his white hair was as smooth as a bird\u0027s breast. \"Let\u0027s go to some quiet bar and have a drink,\" he said, as if he had been in ten minutes before. \"If you have the time, that is.\" We didn\u0027t shake hands. We never did. Englishmen don\u0027t shake hands all the time like Americans and although he wasn\u0027t English he had some of the mannerisms. I said: \"Let\u0027s go by my place and pick up your fancy suitcase. It kind of worries me.\" He shook his head. \"It would be kind of you to keep it for me.\" \"Why?\" \"I just feel that way. Do you mind? It\u0027s a sort of link with a time when I wasn\u0027t a no-good waster.\" \"Nuts to that,\" I said. \"But it\u0027s your business.\" \"If it bothers you because you think it might be stolen—\" \"That\u0027s your business too. Let\u0027s go get that drink.\" We went to Victor\u0027s. He drove me in a rust-colored Jupiter-Jowett with a flimsy canvas rain top under which there was only just room for the two of us. It had pale leather upholstery and what looked like silver fittings. I\u0027m not too fussy about cars, but the damn thing did make my mouth water a little. He said it would do sixty-five in second. It had a squatty little gear shift that barely came up to his knee. \"Four speeds,\" he said. \"They haven\u0027t invented an automatic shift that will work for one of these jobs yet. You don\u0027t really need one. You can start it in third even uphill and that\u0027s as high as you can shift in traffic anyway.\" \"Wedding present?\" \"Just a casual \u0027I happened to see this gadget in a window\u0027 sort of present. I\u0027m a very pampered guy.\" \"Nice,\" I said. \"If there\u0027s no price tag.\" He glanced at me quickly and then put his eyes back on the wet pavement. Double wipers swished gently over the little windscreen. \"Price tag? There\u0027s always a price tag, chum. You think I\u0027m not happy maybe?\" \"Sorry. I was out of line.\" \"I\u0027m rich. Who the hell wants to be happy?\" There was a bitterness in his voice that was new to me. \"How\u0027s your drinking?\" \"Perfectly elegant, old top. For some strange reason I seem to be able to handle the stuff. But you never know, do you?\" \"Perhaps you were never really a drunk.\" We sat in a corner of the bar at Victor\u0027s and drank gimlets. \"They. don\u0027t know how to make them here,\" he said. \"What they call a gimlet is just some lime or lemon juice and gin with a dash of sugar and bitters. A real gimlet is half gin and half Rose\u0027s Lime Juice and nothing else. It beats martinis hollow.\" \"I was never fussy about drinks. How did you get on with Randy Starr? Down my street he\u0027s called a tough number.\" He leaned back and looked thoughtful. \"I guess he is. I guess they all are. But it doesn\u0027t show on him. I could name you a couple of lads in the same racket in Hollywood that act the part. Randy doesn\u0027t bother. In Las Vegas he\u0027s a legitimate businessman. You look him up next time you\u0027re there. He\u0027ll be your pal.\" \"Not too likely. I don\u0027t like hoodlums.\" \"That\u0027s just a word, Marlowe. We have that kind of world. Two wars gave it to us and we are going to keep it. Randy and I and another fellow were in a jam once. It made a sort of bond between us.\" \"Then why didn\u0027t you ask him for help when you needed it?\" He drank up his drink and signaled the waiter. \"Because he couldn\u0027t refuse.\" The waiter brought fresh drinks and I said: \"That\u0027s just talk to me. If by any chance the guy owed you something, think of his end. He\u0027d like a chance to pay something back.\" He shook his head slowly. \"I know you\u0027re right, Of course I did ask him for a job. But I worked at it while I had it. As for asking favors or handouts, no,\" \"But you\u0027ll take them from a stranger.\" He looked me straight in the eye. \"The stranger can keep going and pretend not to hear.\" We had three gimlets, not doubles, and it didn\u0027t do a thing to him. That much would just get a real souse started. So I guess maybe he was cured at that. Then he drove me back to the office. \"We have dinner at eight-fifteen,\" he said. \"Only millionaires can afford it. Only millionaires\u0027 servants will stand for it nowadays. Lots of lovely people coming.\" From then on it got to be a sort of habit with him to drop in around five o\u0027clock. We didn\u0027t always go to the same bar, but oftener to Victor\u0027s than anywhere else. It may have had some association for him that I didn\u0027t know about. He never drank too much, and that surprised him. \"It must be something like the tertian ague,\" he said. \"When it hits you it\u0027s bad. When you don\u0027t have it, it\u0027s as though you never did have it.\" \"What I don\u0027t get is why a guy with your privileges would want to drink with a private eye.\" \"Are you being modest?\" \"Nope. I\u0027m just puzzled. I\u0027m a reasonably friendly type but we don\u0027t live in the same world. I don\u0027t even know where you hang out except that it\u0027s Encino. I should guess your home life is adequate.\" \"I don\u0027t have any home life.\" We were drinking gimlets again. The place was almost empty. There was the usual light scattering of compulsive drinkers getting tuned up at the bar on the stools, the kind that reach very slowly for the first one and watch their hands so they won\u0027t knock anything over. \"I don\u0027t get that. Am I supposed to?\" \"Big production, no story, as they say around the movie lots. I guess Sylvia is happy enough, though not necessarily with me. In our cirde that\u0027s not too important. There\u0027s always something to do if you don\u0027t have to work or consider the cost. It\u0027s no real fun but the rich don\u0027t know that. They never had any. They never want anything very hard except maybe somebody else\u0027s wife and that\u0027s a pretty pale desire compared with the way a plumber\u0027s wife wants new curtains for the living room.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. I let him carry the ball. \"Mostly I just kill time,\" he said, \"and it dies hard. A little tennis, a little golf, a little swimming and horseback riding, and the exquisite pleasure of watching Sylvia\u0027s friends trying to hold out to lunch time before they start killing their hangovers.\" \"The night you went to Vegas she said she didn\u0027t like drunks.\" He grinned crookedly. I was getting so used to his scarred face that I only noticed it when some change of expression emphasized its one-sided woodenness. \"She meant drunks without money. With money they are just heavy drinkers. If they vomit in the lanai, that\u0027s for the butler to handle.\" \"You didn\u0027t have to have it the way it is.\" He finished his drink at a gulp and stood up. \"I\u0027ve got to run, Marlowe. Besides I\u0027m boring you and God knows I\u0027m boring myself.\" \"You\u0027re not boring me. I\u0027m a trained listener. Sooner or later I may figure out why you like being a kept poodle.\" He touched his scars gently with a fingertip. He had a remote little smile. \"You should wonder why she wants me around, not why I want to be there, waiting patiently on my satin cushion to have my head patted.\" \"You like satin cushions,\" I said, as I stood up to leave with him. \"You like silk sheets and bells to ring and the butler to come with his deferential smile.\" \"Could be. I was raised in an orphanage in Salt Lake City.\" We went out into the tired evening and he said he wanted to walk. We had come in my car, and for once I had been fast enough to grab the check. I watched him out of sight. The light from a store window caught the gleam of his white hair for a moment as he faded into the light mist. I liked him better drunk, down and out, hungry and beaten and proud. Or did I? Maybe I just liked being top man. His reasons for things were hard to figure. In my business there\u0027s a time to ask questions and a time to let your man simmer until he boils over. Every good cop knows that. It\u0027s a good deal like chess or boxing: Some people you have to crowd and keep off balance. Some you just box and they will end up beating themselves. He would have told me the story of his life if I had asked him. But I never even asked him how he got his face smashed. If I had and he told me, it just possibly might have saved a couple of lives. Just possibly, no more.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49347.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
