{"id":45293,"no":38,"title":"chapter 38","content":"They Candy in a chair against the wall of the Sheriff\u0027s anteroom. He hated me with his eyes as I went by him into the big square room where Sheriff Petersen held court in the middle of a collection of testimonials from a grateful public to his twenty years of faithful public service. The walls were loaded with photographs of horses and Sheriff Petersen made a personal appearance in every photograph. The corners of his carved desk were horses\u0027 heads. His inkwell was a mounted polished horse\u0027s hoof and his pens were planted in the mate to it filled with white sand. A gold plate on each of these said something or other about a date. In the middle of a spotless desk blotter lay a bag of Bull Durham and a pack of brown cigarette papers. Petersen rolled his own. He could roll one with one hand on horseback and often did, especially when leading a parade on a big white horse with a Mexican saddle loaded with beautiful Mexican silverwork. On horseback he wore a flat-crowned Mexican sombrero. He rode beautifully and his horse always knew exactly when to be quiet, when to act up so that the Sheriff with his calm inscrutable smile could bring the horse back under control with one hand. The Sheriff had a good act. He had a handsome hawklike profile, getting a little saggy under the chin by now, but he knew how to hold his head so it wouldn\u0027t show too much. He put a lot of hard work into having his picture taken. He was in his middle fifties and his father, a Dane, had left him a lot of money. The Sheriff didn\u0027t look like a Dane, because his hair was dark and his skin was brown and he had the impassive poise of a cigar store Indian and about the same kind of brains. But nobody had ever called him a crook. There had been crooks in his department and they had fooled him as well as they had fooled the public, but none of the crookedness rubbed off on Sheriff Petersen. He just went right on getting elected without even trying, riding white horses at the head of parades, and questioning suspects in front of cameras. That\u0027s what the captions said. As a matter of fact he never questioned anybody. He wouldn\u0027t have known how. He just sat at his desk looking sternly at the suspect, showing his profile to the camera. The flash bulbs would go off, the camera men woukl thank the Sheriff deferentially, and the suspect would be removed not having opened his mouth, and the Sheriff would go home to his ranch in the San Fernando Valley. There he could always be reached. If you couldn\u0027t reach him in person, you could talk to one of his horses. Once in a while, come election thne, some misguided politician would try to get Sheriff Petersen\u0027s job, and would be apt to call him things like The Guy With The Built-In Profile or The Ham That Smokes Itself, but it didn\u0027t get him anywhere. Sheriff Petersen just went right on getting re-elected, a living testimonial to the fact that you can hold an important public office forever in our country with no qualifications for it but a clean nose, a photogenic face, and a close mouth. If on top of that you look good on a horse, you are unbeatable. As Ohls and I went in, Sheriff Petersen was standing behind his desk and the camera boys were filing out by another door. The Sheriff had his white Stetson Ofl. He was rolling a cigarette. He was all set to go home. He looked at me sternly. \"Who\u0027s this?\" he asked in a rich baritone voice. \"Name\u0027s Philip Marlowe, Chief,\" Ohls said. \"Only person in the house when Wade shot himself. You want a picture?\" The Sheriff studied me. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he said, and turned to a big tired-looking man with iron-gray hair. \"If you need me, I\u0027ll be at the ranch, Captain Hernandez.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Petersen lit his cigarette with a kitchen match. He lit it on his thumbnail. No lighters for Sheriff Petersen. He was strictly a roll-yourown-and-.light-\u0027em-with-one-hand type. He said goodnight and went out. A deadpan character with hard black eyes went with him, his personal bodyguard. The door closed. When he was gone Captain Hernandez moved to the desk and sat in the Sheriff\u0027s enormous chair and a stenotype operator in the corner moved his stand out from the wall to get elbow room. Ohls sat at the end of the desk and looked amused. \"All right, Marlowe,\" Hernandez said briskly. \"Let\u0027s have it.\" \"How come I don\u0027t get my photo taken?\" \"You heard what the Sheriff said.\" \"Yeah, but why?\" I whined. Ohls laughed. \"You know damn well why.\" \"You mean on account of I\u0027m tall, dark, and handsome and somebody might look at me?\" \"Cut it,\" Hernandez said coldly. \"Let\u0027s get on with your statement. Start from the beginning.\" I gave it to them from the beginning: my interview with Howard Spencer, my meeting with Eileen Wade, her asking me to find Roger, my finding him, her asking me to the house, what Wade asked me to do and how I found him passed out near the hibiscus bushes and the rest of it. The stenotype operator took it down. Nobody interrupted me. All of it was true. The truth and nothing but the truth. But not quite all the truth. What I left out was my business. \"Nice,\" Hernandez said at the end. \"But not quite complete.\" This was a cool competent dangerous guy, this Hernandez. Somebody in the Sheriff\u0027s office had to be. \"The night Wade shot off the gun in his bedroom you went into Mrs. Wade\u0027s room and were in there for some time with the door shut. What were you doing in there?\" \"She called me in and asked me how he was.\" \"Why shut the door?\" \"Wade was half asleep and I didn\u0027t want to make any noise. Also the hbuseboy was hanging around with his ear out. Also she asked me to shut the door. I didn\u0027t realize it was going to be important.\" \"How long were you in there?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Three minutes maybe.\" \"I suggest you were in there a couple of hours,\" Hernandez said coldly. \"Do I make myself clear?\" I looked at Ohls. Ohls didn\u0027t look at anything. He was chewing on an unlighted cigarette as usual. \"You are misinformed, Captain.\" \"We\u0027ll see. After you left the room you went downstairs to the study and spent the night on the couch. Perhaps I should say the rest of the night.\" \"It was ten minutes to eleven when he called me at home. It was long past two o\u0027clock when I went into the study for the last time that night. Call it the rest of the night if you like.\" \"Get the houseboy in here,\" Hernandez said. Ohls went out and came back with Candy. They put Candy in a chair. Hernandez asked him a few questions to establish who he was and so on. Then he said: \"All right, Candy—we\u0027ll call you that for convenience— after you helped Marlowe put Roger Wade to bed, what happened?\" I knew what was coming more or less. Candy told his story in a quiet savage voice with very little accent. It seemed as if he could turn that on and off at will. His story was that he had hung around downstairs in case he was wanted again, part of the time in the kitchen where he got himself some food, part of the time in the living room. While in the living room sitting in a chair near the front door he had seen Eileen Wade standing in the door of her room and he had seen her take her clothes off. He had seen her put a robe on with nothing under it and he had seen me go into her room and I shut the door and stayed in there a long time, a couple of hours he thought. He had gone up the stairs and listened. He had heard the bedsprings making sounds. He had heard whispering. He made his meaning very obvious. When he had finished he gave me a corrosive look and his mouth was twisted tight with hatred. \"Take him out,\" Hernandez said. \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"I want to question him.\" \"I ask the questions here,\" Hernandez said sharply. \"You don\u0027t know how, Captain. You weren\u0027t there. He\u0027s lying and he knows it and I know it.\" Hernandez leaned back and picked up one of the Sheriff\u0027s pens. He bent the handle of the pen. It was long and pointed and made of stiffened horsehair. When he let go of the point it sprang back. \"Shoot,\" he said at last. I faced Candy. \"Where were you when you saw Mrs. Wade take her clothes off?\" \"I was sitting down in a chair near the fiont door,\" he said in a surly tone. \"Between the front door and the two facing davenports?\" \"What I said.\" \"Where was Mrs. Wade?\" \"Just inside the door of her room. The door was open.\" \"What light was there in the living room?\" \"One lamp. Tall lamp what they call a bridge lamp.\" \"What light was on the balcony?\" \"No light. Light in her bedroom.\" \"What kind of light in her bedroom?\" \"Not much light. Night table lamp, maybe.\" \"Not a ceiling light?\" \"No.\" \"After she took her clothes off—standing just inside the door of her room, you said—she put on a robe. What kind of robe?\" \"Blue robe. Long thing like a house coat. She tie it with a sash.\" \"So if you hadn\u0027t actually seen her take her clothes off you wouldn\u0027t know what she had on under the robe?\" He shrugged. He looked vaguely worried. \"Si. That\u0027s right. But I see her take her clothes off.\" \"You\u0027re a liar. There isn\u0027t any place in the living room from which you could see her take her clothes off right bang in her doorway, much less inside her room. She would have to come out to the edge of the balcony. If she had done that she would have seen you.\" He just glared at me. I turned to Ohls. \"You\u0027ve seen the house. Captain Hernandez hasn\u0027t—or has he?\" Ohls shook his head slightly. Hernandez frowned andsaid nothing. \"There is no spot in that living room, Captain Hernandez, from which he could see even the top of Mrs. Wade\u0027s head — even if he was standing up—and he says he was sitting down—provided she was as far back as her own doorway or inside it. I\u0027m four inches taller than he is and I could only see the top foot of an open door when I was standing just inside the front door of the house, She would have to come out to the edge of the balcony for him to see what he says he saw. Why would she do that? Why would she undress in her doorway even? There\u0027s no sense to it.\" Hernandez just looked at me. Then he looked at Candy. \"How about the time element?\" he asked softly, speaking to me. \"That\u0027s his word against mine. I\u0027m talking about what can be proved.\" Hernandez spit Spanish at Candy too fast for me to understand. Candy just stared at him sulkily. \"Take him out,\" Hernandez said. Ohls jerked a thumb and opened the door. Candy went out. Hernandez brought out a box of cigarettes, stuck one on his lip, and lit it with a gold lighter, Ohls came back into the room, Hernandez said calmly: \"I just told him that if there was an inquest and he told that story on the stand, he\u0027d find himself doing a one-to-three up in Q for perjury. Didn\u0027t seem to impress him much. It\u0027s obvious what\u0027s eating him, An old-fashioned case of hot pants, If he\u0027d been around and we had any reason to suspect murder, he\u0027d make a pretty good pigeon—except that he would have used a knife. I got the impression earlier that he felt pretty bad about Wade\u0027s death. Any questions you want to ask, Ohls?\" Ohls shook his head. Hernandez looked at me and said: \"Come back in the morning and sign your statement. We\u0027ll have it typed out by then. We ought to have a P.M. report by ten o\u0027clock, preliminary anyway. Anything you don\u0027t like about this setup, Marlowe?\" \"Would you mind rephrasing the question? The way you put it suggests there might be something I do like about it.\" \"Okay,\" he said wearily. \"Take off. I\u0027m going home.\" I stood up. \"Of course I never did believe that stuff Candy pulled on us,\" he said. \"Just used it for a corkscrew. No hard feelings, I hope.\" \"No feelings at all, Captain. No feelings at all.\" They watched me go out and didn\u0027t say goodnight. I walked down the long corridor to the Hill Street entrance and got into my car and drove home. No feelings at all was exactly right. I was as hollow and empty as the spaces between the stars. When I got home I mixed a stiff one and stood by the open window in the living room and sipped it and listened to the groundswell of the traffic on Laurel Canyon Boulevard and looked at the glare of the big angry city hanging over the shoulder of the hills through which the boulevard had been cut. Far off the banshee wail of police or fire sirens rose and fell, never for very long completely silent Twenty.four hours a day somebody is running, somebody else is trying to catch him. Out there in the night of a thousand crimes people were dying, being maimed, cut by flying glass, crushed against steering wheels or under heavy tires. People were being beaten, robbed, strangled, raped, and murdered. People were hungry, sick; bored, desperate with loneliness or remorse or fear, angry, cruel, feverish, shaken by sobs. A city no worse than others, a city rich and vigorous and full of pride, a city lost and beaten and full of emptiness. It all depends on where you sit and what your own private score is. I didn\u0027t have one. I didn\u0027t care. I finished the drink and went to bed. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49382.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
