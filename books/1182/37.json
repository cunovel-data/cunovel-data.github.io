{"id":45292,"no":37,"title":"chapter 37","content":"Ohls was a medium-sized thick man with short-cropped faded blond hair and faded blue eyes. He had stiff white eyebrows and in the days before he stopped wearing a hat you were always a little surprised when he took it off—there was so much more head than you expected. He was a hard tough cop with a grim outlook on life but a very decent guy underneath. He ought to have made captain years ago. He had passed the examination among the top three half a dozen times. But the Sheriff didn\u0027t like him and he didn\u0027t like the Sheriff. He came down the stairs rubbing the side of his jaw. Flashlights had been going off in the study for a long time. Men had gone in and out. I had just sat in the living room with a plain-clothes dick and waited. Ohls sat down on the edge of a chair and dangled his hands. He was chewing on an unlit cigarette. He looked at me broodingly. \"Remember the old days when they had a gatehouse and a private police force in Idle Valley?\" I nodded. \"And gambling also.\" \"Sure. You can\u0027t stop it. This whole valley is still private property. Like Arrowhead used to be, and Emerald Bay. Long time since I was on a case with no reporters jumping around. Somebody must have whispered in Sheriff Petersen\u0027s ear. They kept it off the teletype.\" \"Real considerate of them,\" I said. \"How is Mrs. Wade?\" \"Too relaxed. She must of grabbed some pills. There\u0027s a dozen kinds up there—even demeroL That\u0027s bad stuff. Your friends don\u0027t have a lot of luck lately, do they? They get dead.\" I didn\u0027t have anything to say to that. \"Gunshot suicides always interest me,\" Ohls said loosely. \"So easy to fake. The wife says you killed him. Why would she say that?\" \"She doesn\u0027t mean it literally.\" \"Nobody else was here. She says you knew where the gun was, knew he was getting drunk, knew he had fired off the gun the other night when she had to fight with him to get the gun away from him, You were there that night too. Don\u0027t seem to help much, do you?\" \"I searched his desk this afternoon. No gun. I\u0027d told her where it was and to put it away. She says now she didn\u0027t believe in that sort of thing.\" \"Just when would \u0027now\u0027 be?\" Ohls asked gruffly. \"After she came home and before I phoned the substation.\" \"You searched the desk. Why?\" Ohls lifted his hands and put them on his knees. He was looking at me indifferently, as if he didn\u0027t care what I said. \"He was getting drunk. I thought it just as well to have the gun somewhere else. But he didn\u0027t try to kill himself the other night. It was just show-off.\" Ohls nodded. He took the chewed cigarette out of his mouth, dropped it into a tray, and put a fresh one in place of it. \"I quit smoking,\" he said. \"Got me coughing too much, But the goddam things still ride me. Can\u0027t feel right without one in my mouth. You supposed to watch the guy when he\u0027s alone?\" \"Certainly not. He asked me to come out and have lunch. We talked and he was kind of depressed about his writing not going well. He decided to hit the bottle. Think I should have taken it away from him?\" \"I\u0027m not thinking yet. I\u0027m just trying to get a picture. How much drinking did you do?\" \"Beer.\" \"It\u0027s your tough luck you were here, Marlowe. What was the check for? The one he wrote and signed and tore up?\" \"They all wanted me to come and live here and keep him in line. All means himself, his wife, and his publisher, a man named Howard Spencer. He\u0027s in New York, I guess. You can check with him. I turned it down. Afterwards she came to me and said her husband was off on a toot and she was worried and would I find him and bring him home. I did that. Next thing I knew I was carrying him in off his front lawn and putting him to bed. I didn\u0027t want any part of it, Bernie. It just kind of grew up around me.\" \"Nothing to do with the Lennox case, huh?\" \"Aw, for Pete\u0027s sake. There isn\u0027t any Lennox case.\" \"How true,\" Ohls said dryly. He squeezed his kneecaps. A man came in at the front door and spoke to the other dick. Then came across to Ohls. \"There\u0027s a Dr. Loring outside, Lieutenant. Says he was called. He\u0027s the lady\u0027s doctor.\" \"Let him in.\" The dick went back and Dr. Loring came in with his neat black bag. He was cool and elegant in a tropical worsted suit. He went past me without looking at me. \"Upstairs?\" he asked Ohls. \"Yeah — in her room.\" Ohls stood up. \"What you give her that demerol for, Doc?\" Dr. Loring frowned at him. \"I prescribe for my patient as I think proper,\" he said coldly. \"I am not required to explain why. Who says I gave Mrs. Wade demerol?\" \"I do. The bottle\u0027s up there with your name on it. She\u0027s got a regular drugstore in her bathroom. Maybe you don\u0027t know it, Doc, but we have a pretty complete exhibit of the little pills downtown. Bluejays, redbirds, yellow jackets, goofballs, and all the rest of the list. Demerol\u0027s about the worst of the lot. That\u0027s the stuff Goering lived on, I heard somewhere. Took eighteen a day when they caught him. Took the army doctors three months to cut him down.\" \"I don\u0027t know what those words mean,\" Dr. Loring said frigidly. \"You don\u0027t? Pity. Bluejays are sodium amytal. Redbirds are seconal. Yellow jackets are nembutal. Goofballs are one of the barbiturates laced with benzedrine. Demerol is a synthetic narcotic that is very habit forming. You just hand \u0027em out, huh? Is the lady suffering from something serious?\" \"A drunken husband can be a very serious complaint indeed for a sensitive woman,\" Dr. Loring said. \"You didn\u0027t get around to him, huh? Pity. Mrs. Wade\u0027s upstairs, Doc. Thanks for the time.\" \"You are impertinent, sir. I shall report you.\" \"Yeah, do that,\" Ohls said. \"But before you report me, do something else. Keep the lady clear in her head. I\u0027ve got .uestions to ask.\" \"I shall do exactly what I think best for her condition. Do you know who I am, by any chance? And just to make matters clear, Mr. Wade was not my patient. I don\u0027t treat alcoholics.\" \"Just their wives, huh?\" Ohls snarled at him. \"Yeah, I know who you are, Doc. I\u0027m bleeding internally. My name is Ohls. Lieutenant Ohls.\" Dr. Loring went on up the stairs. Obis sat down again and grinned at me. \"You got to be diplomatic with this kind of people,\" he said. A man came out of the study and came up to Ohls. A thin serious-looking man with glasses and a brainy forehead. \"Lieutenant.\" \"Shoot.\" \"The wound is contact, typically suicidal, with a good deal of distention from gas pressure. The eyes are exophthalmic from the same cause. I don\u0027t think there will be any prints on the outside of the gun. It\u0027s been bled on too freely.\" \"Could it be homicide if the guy was asleep or passed out drunk?\" Ohls asked him. \"Of course, but there\u0027s no indication of it. The gun\u0027s a Webley Hammerless. Typically, this gun takes a very stiff pull to cock it, but a very light pull to discharge it. The recoil explains the position of the gun. I see nothing against suicide so far. I expect a high figure on alcoholic concentration. If it\u0027s high enough — \" the man stopped and shrugged meaningly—\"I might be inclined to doubt suicide.\" \"Thanks. Somebody call the coroner?\" The man nodded and went away, Ohls yawned and looked at his watch. Then he looked at me. \"You want to blow?\" \"Sure, if you\u0027ll let me. I thought I was a suspect.\" \"We might oblige you later on. Stick around where you can be found, that\u0027s all. You were a dick once, you know how they go. Some you got to work fast before the evidence gets away from you, This one is just the opposite. If it was a homicide, who wanted him dead? His wife? She wasn\u0027t here. You? Fine, you had the house to yourself and knew where the gun was. A perfect setup, Everything but a motive, and we might perhaps give some weight to your experience. I figure if you wanted to kill a guy, you could maybe do it a little less obviously.\" \"Thahks, Bernie. I could at that.\" \"The help wasn\u0027t here. They\u0027re out. So it must have been somebody that just happened to drop by. That somebody had to know where Wade\u0027s gun was, had to find him drunk enough to be asleep or passed out, and had to pull the trigger when that speedboat was making enough noise to drown the shot, and had to get away before you came back into the house. That I don\u0027t buy on any knowledge I have now. The only person who had the means and opportunity was the one guy who wouldn\u0027t have used them — for the simple reason he was the one guy who had them.\" I stood up to go. \"Okay, Bernie. I\u0027ll be home all evening.\" \"There\u0027s just one thing,\" Ohls said musingly. \"This man Wade was a big time writer. Lots of dough, lots of reputation. I don\u0027t go for his sort of crap myself. You might find nicer people than his characters in a whorehouse. That\u0027s a matter of taste and none of my business as a cop. With all this money he had a beautiful home in one of the best places to live in in the county. He had a beautiful wife, lots of friends, and no troubles at all. What I want to know is what made all that so tough that he had to pull a trigger? Sure as hell something did. If you know, you better get ready to lay it on the line. See you.\" I went to the door. The man on the door looked back at Ohls, got the sign, and let me out. I got into my car and had to edge over on the lawn to get around the various official cars that jammed the driveway. At the gate another deputy looked me over but didn\u0027t say anything. I slipped my dark glasses on and drove back towards the main highway. The road was empty and peacefuL The afternoon sun beat down on the manicured lawns and the large roomy expensive houses behind them. A man not unknown to the world had died in a pool of blood in a house in Idle Valley, but the lazy quiet had not been disturbed. So far as the newspapers were concerned it might have happened in Tibet. At a turn of the road the walls of two estates came down to the shoulder and a dark green sheriff\u0027s car was parked there. A deputy got out and held up his hand. I stopped. He came to the window. \"May I see your driver\u0027s license, please?\" I took out my wallet and handed it to him open. \"Just the license, please, I\u0027m not allowed to touch your wallet.\" I took it out and gave it to him. \"What\u0027s the trouble?\" He glanced into my car and handed me back my license. \"No trouble,\" he said. \"Just a routine check. Sorry to have troubled you.\" He waved me on and went back to the parked car. Just like a cop. They never tell you why they are doing anything. That way you don\u0027t find out they don\u0027t know themselves. I drove home, bought myself a couple of cold drinks, went out to dinner, came back, opened the windows and my shirt and waited for something to happen. I waited a long time. It was nine o\u0027clock when Bernie Ohls called up and told me to come in and not stop on the way to pick any flowers. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49381.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
