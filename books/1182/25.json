{"id":45280,"no":25,"title":"chapter 25","content":"Nothing happened for a week except that I went about my business which just then didn\u0027t happen to be very much business. One morning George Peters of The Carne Organization called me up and told me he had happened to be down Sepulveda Canyon way and had looked in on Dr. Verringer\u0027s place just out of curiosity. But Dr. Verringer was no longer there. Half a dozen teams of surveyors were mapping the tract for a subdivision. Those he spoke to had never even heard of Dr. Verringer. \"The poor sucker got closed out on a trust deed,\" Peters said. \"I checked. They gave him a grand for a quit claim just to save time and expense, and now somebody is going to make a million bucks clear, out of cutting the place up for residential property. That\u0027s the difference between crime and business. For business you gotta have capitaL Sometimes I think it\u0027s the only difference.\" \"A properly cynical remark,\" I said, \"but big time crime takes capital too.\" \"And where does it come from, chum? Not from guys that hold up liquor stores. So long. See you soon.\" It was ten minutes to eleven on a Thursday night when Wade called me up. His voice was thick, almost gurgling, but I recognized it somehow. And I could hear short hard rapid breathing over the telephone. \"I\u0027m in bad shape, Marlowe. Very bad. I\u0027m slipping my anchor. Could you make it out here in a hurry?\" \"Sure—but let me talk to Mrs. Wade a minute.\" He didn\u0027t answer. There was a crashing sound, then a dead silence, then in a short while a kind of banging around. I yelled something into the phone without getting any answer. Time passed. Finally the light click of the receiver being replaced and the buzz of an open line. In five minutes I was on the way. I made it in slightly over half an hour and I still don\u0027t know how. I went over the pass on wings and hit Ventura Boulevard with the light against me and made a left turn anyhow and dodged between trucks and generally made a damn fool of myself. I went through Encino at close to sixty with a spotlight on the outer edge of the parked cars so that it would freeze anyone with a notion to step out suddenly. I had the kind of luck you only get when you don\u0027t care. No cops, no sirens, no red flashers. Just visions of what might be happening in the Wade residence and not very pleasant visions, She was alone in the house with a drunken maniac, she was lying at the bottom of the stairs with her neck broken, she was behind a locked door and somebody was howling outside and trying to break it in, she was running down a moonlit road barefoot and a big buck Negro with a meat cleaver was chasing her. It wasn\u0027t like that at all. When I swung the Olds into their driveway lights were on all over the house and she was standing in the open doorway with a cigarette in her mouth. I got out and walked over the flagstones to her. She had slacks on and a shirt with an open collar. She looked at me calmly. If there was any excitement around there I had brought it with me. The first thing I said was as loony as the rest of my behavior. \"I thought you didn\u0027t smoke.\" \"What? No, I don\u0027t usually.\" She took the cigarette out and looked at it and dropped it and stepped on it. \"Once in a long while. He called Dr. Verringer.\" It was a remote placid voice, a voice heard at night over water. Completely relaxed. \"He couldn\u0027t,\" I said. \"Dr. Verringer doesn\u0027t live there any more. He called me.\" \"Oh really? I just heard him telephoning and asking someone to come in a hurry. I thought it must be Dr. Verringer.\" \"Where is he now?\" \"He fell down,\" she said. \"He must have tipped the chair too far back. He\u0027s done it before. He cut his head on something. There\u0027s a little blood, not much.\" \"Well, that\u0027s fine,\" I said. \"We wouldn\u0027t want a whole lot of blood. Where is he now, I asked you.\" She looked at me solemnly. Then she pointed, \"Out there somewhere. By the edge of the road or in the bushes along the fence.\" I leaned forward and peered at her. \"Chrissake, didn\u0027t you look?\" I decided by this time that she was in shock. Then I looked back across the lawn. I didn\u0027t see anything but there was heavy shadow near the fence. \"No, I didn\u0027t look,\" she said quite calmly. \"You find him. I\u0027ve had all of it I can take. I\u0027ve had more than I can take. You find him.\" She turned and walked back into the house, leaving the door open. She didn\u0027t walk very far. About a yard inside the door she just crumpled to the floor and lay there. I scooped her up and spread her out on one of the two big davenports that faced each other across a long blond cocktail table. I felt her pulse. It didn\u0027t seem very weak or unsteady. Her eyes were closed and the lids were blue. I left her there and went back out. He was there all right, just as she had said. He was lying on his side in the shadow of the hibiscus. He had a fast thumping pulse and his breathing was unnaturaL Something on the back of his head was sticky. I spoke to him and shook him a little. I slapped his face a couple of times, He mumbled but didn\u0027t come to. I dragged him up into a sitting position and dragged one of his arms over my shoulder and heaved him up with my back turned to him and grabbed for a leg. I lost. He was as heavy as a block of cement. We both sat down on the grass and I took a short breather and tried again, Finally I got him hoisted into a fireman\u0027s lift position and plowed across the lawn in the direction of the open front door. It seemed about the same distance as a round trip to Siam. The two steps of the porch were ten feet high. I staggered over to the couch and went down on my knees and rolled him off. When I straightened up again my spine felt as if ft had cracked in at least three places. Eileen Wade wasn\u0027t there any more. I had the room to myself. I was too bushed at the moment to care where anybody was. I sat down and looked at him and waited for some breath. Then I looked at his head. It was smeared with blood. His hair was sticky with it. It didn\u0027t look very bad but you never know with a head wound. Then Eileen Wade was standing beside me, quietly looking down at him with that same remote expression. \"I\u0027m sorry I fainted,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know why.\" \"I guess we\u0027d better call a doctor.\" \"I telephoned Dr. Loring. He is my doctor, you know. He didn\u0027t want to come.\" \"Try somebody else then.\" \"Oh he\u0027s coming,\" she said. \"He didn\u0027t want to. But he\u0027s coming as soon as he can manage.\" \"Where\u0027s Candy?\" \"This is his day off. Thursday. The cook and Candy have Thursdays off. It\u0027s the usual thing around here. Can you get him up to bed?\" \"Not without help. Better get a rug or blanket. It\u0027s a warm night, but cases like this get pneumonia very easily.\" She said she would get a rug. I thought it was damn nice of her. But I wasn\u0027t thinking very intelligently. I was too bushed from carrying him. We spread a steamer rug over him and in fifteen minutes Dr. Loring came, complete with starched collar and rimless cheaters and the expression of a man who has been asked to clean up after the dog got sick. He examined Wade\u0027s head. \"A superficial cut and bruise,\" he said. \"No chance of concussion. I should say his breath would indicate his condition rather obviously.\" He reached for his hat. He picked up his bag. \"Keep him warm,\" he said. \"You might bathe his head gently and get rid of the blood. He\u0027ll sleep it off.\" \"I can\u0027t get him upstairs alone, Doctor,\" I said. \"Then leave him where he is,\" He looked at me without interest. \"Goodnight, Mrs. Wade. As you know I don\u0027t treat alcoholics. Even if I did, your husband would not be one of my patients. I\u0027m sure you understand that.\" \"Nobody\u0027s asking you to treat him,\" I said. \"I\u0027m asking for some help to get him into his bedroom so that I can undress him.\" \"And just who are you?\" Dr. Loring asked me freezingly. \"My name\u0027s Marlowe. I was here a week ago. Your wife introduced me.\" \"Interesting,\" he said. \"In what connection do you know my wife?\" \"What the hell does that matter? All I want is—\" \"I\u0027m not interested in what you want,\" he cut in on me. He turned to Eileen, nodded briefly, and started out. I got between him and the door and put my back to it. \"Just a minute, Doc. Must be a long time since you glanced at that little piece of prose called the Hippocratic Oath. This man called me on the phone and I live some way off. He sounded bad and I broke every traffic law in the state getting over here. I found him lying on the ground and I carried him in here and believe me he isn\u0027t any bunch of feathers. The houseboy is away and there\u0027s nobody here to help me upstairs with Wade. How does it look to you?\" \"Get out of my way,\" he said between his teeth. \"Or I shall call the sheriff\u0027s substation and have them send over a deputy. As a professional man—\" \"As a professional man you\u0027re a handful of flea dirt,\" I said, and moved out of his way. He turned red—slowly but distinctly. He choked on his own bile. Then he opened the door and went out. He shut it carefully. As he pulled it shut he looked in at me. It was as nasty a look as I ever got and on as nasty a face as I ever saw. When I turned. away from the door Eileen was smiling. \"What\u0027s funny?\" I snarled. \"You. You don\u0027t care what you say to people, do you? Don\u0027t you know who Dr. Loring is?\" \"Yeah—and I know what he is.\" She glanced at her wrist watch. \"Candy ought to be home by now,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll go see. He has a room behind the garage.\" She went out through an archway and I sat down and looked at Wade, The great big writer man went on snoring. His face was sweaty but I left the rug over him. In a minute or two Eileen came back and she had Candy with her.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49369.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
