{"id":45264,"no":9,"title":"chapter 9","content":"The deputy on the early night shift was a big blond guy with meaty shoulders and a friendly grin. He was middleaged and had long since outlived both pity and anger. He wanted to put in eight easy hours and he looked as if almost anything would he easy down his street. He unlocked my door. \"Company for you. Guy from the D.A.\u0027s office. No sleep, huh?\" \"It\u0027s a little early for me. What time is it?\" \"Ten-fourteen.\" He stood in the doorway and looked over the cell. One blanket was spread on the lower bunk, one was folded for a pillow. There were a couple of used paper towels in the trash bucket and a small wad of toilet paper on the edge of the washbasin. He nodded approval. \"Anything personal in here?\" \"Just me.\" He left the cell door open. We walked along a quiet corridor to the elevator and rode down to the booking desk. A fat man in a gray suit stood by the desk smoking a corncob. His fingernails were dirty and he smelled. \"I\u0027m Spranklin from the D.A.\u0027s office,\" he told me in a tough voice. \"Mr. Grenz wants you upstairs.\" He reached behind his hip and came up with a pair of bracelets. \"Let\u0027s try these for size.\" The jail deputy and the booking derk grinned at him with deep enjoyment. \"What\u0027s the matter, Sprank? Afraid he\u0027ll mug you in the elevator?\" \"I don\u0027t want no trouble,\" he growled. \"Had a guy break from me once. They ate my ass off. Let\u0027s go, boy.\" The booking clerk pushed a form at him and he signed it with a flourish. \"I never take no unnecessary chances,\" he said. \"Man never knows what he\u0027s up against in this town.\" A prowl car cop brought in a drunk with a bloody ear went towards the elevator. \"You\u0027re in trouble, boy,\" Spranklin told me in the elevator Heap bad trouble It seemed to give him a vague satisfaction A guy can get hisself in a lot of trouble in this town.\" The elevator man turned his head and winked at me. I grinned. \"Don\u0027t try no thing, boy,\" Spranklin told me severely. \"I shot a man once. Tried to berak. They ate my ass off.\" \"You get it coming and going, don\u0027t you?\" He thought it over. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Either way they eat your ass off. It\u0027s a tough town. No respect.\" We got out and went in through the double doors of the D.A.\u0027s office. The switchboard was dead, with lines plugged in for the night. There was nobody in the waiting chairs. Lights were on in a couple of offices. Spranklin opened the door of a small lighted room which contained a desk, a filing case, a hard chair or two, and a thick-set man with a hard chin and stupid eyes. His face was red and he was just pushing something into the drawer of his desk. \"You could knock,\" he barked at Spranklin. \"Sorry, Mr. Grenz,\" Spranklin bumbled. \"I was thinkin\u0027 about the prisoner.\" He pushed me into-the office. \"Should I take the cuffs off, Mr. Grenz?\" \"I don\u0027t know what the hell you put them on for,\" Grenz said sourly. He watched Spranklin unlock the cuffs on my wrist. He had the key on a bunch the size of a grapefruit and it troubled him to find it. \"Okay, scram,\" Grenz said. \"Wait outside to take him back.\" \"I\u0027m kind of off duty, Mr. Grenz.\" \"You\u0027re off duty when I say you\u0027re off duty.\" Spranklin flushed and edged his fat bottom out through the door. Grenz looked after him savagely, then when the door closed he moved the same look to me. I pulled a chair over and sat down. \"I didn\u0027t tell you to sit down,\" Grenz barked. I got a loose cigarette out of my pocket and stuck it in my mouth. \"And I didn\u0027t say you could smoke,\" Grenz roared. \"I\u0027m allowed to smoke in the cell block. Why not here?\" \"Because this is my office. I make the rules here.\" A raw smell of whiskey floated across the desk. \"Take another quick one,\" I said. \"It\u0027ll calm you down. You got kind of interrupted when we came in.\" His back hit the back of the chair hard. His face went dark red. I struck a match and lit my cigarette. After a long minute Grenz said softly. \"Okay, tough boy. Quite a man, aren\u0027t you? You know something? They\u0027re all sizes and shapes when they come in here, but they all go out the same size —small. And the same shape—bent.\" \"What did you want to see me about, Mr. Grenz? And don\u0027t mind me if you feel like hitting that bottle. I\u0027m a fellow that will take a snort myself, if I\u0027m tired and nervous and overworked.\" \"You don\u0027t seem much impressed by the jam you\u0027re in.\" \"I don\u0027t figure I\u0027m in any jam.\" \"We\u0027ll see about that. Meantime I want a very full statement from you.\" He flicked a finger at a recording set on a stand beside his desk. \"We\u0027ll take it now and have it transcribed tomorrow. If the Chief Deputy is satisfied with your statement, he may release you on your own undertaking not to leave town. Let\u0027s go.\" He switched on the recorder. His voice was cold, decisive, and as nasty as he knew how to make it. But his right hand kept edging towards the desk drawer. He was too young to have veins in his nose, but he had them, and the whites of his eyes were a bad color. \"I get so tired of it,\" I said. \"Tired of what?\" he snapped. \"Hard little men in hard little offices talking hard little words that don\u0027t mean a goddam thing. I\u0027ve had fifty-six hours in the felony block. Nobody pushed me around, nobody tried to prove he was tough. They didn\u0027t have to. They had it on ice for when they needed it. And why was I in there? I was booked on suspicion. What the hell kind of legal system lets a man be shoved in a felony tank because some cop didn\u0027t get an answer to some questions? What evidence did he have? A telephone number on a pad. And what was he trying to prove by locking me up? Not a damn thing except that he had the power to do it. Now you\u0027re on the same pitch—trying to make me feel what a lot of power you generate in this cigar box you call your office. You send this scared baby sitter over late at night to bring me in here. You think maybe sitting alone with my thoughts for fifty-six hours has made gruel out of my brains? You think I\u0027m going to cry in your lap and ask youstroke my head because I\u0027m so awful goddam lonely in the great big jail? Come off it, Grenz. Take your drink and get human: I\u0027m willing to assume you are just doing your job. But take the brass knuckles off before you start. If you\u0027re big enough you don\u0027t need them, and if you need them you\u0027re not big enough to push me around.\" He sat there and listened and looked at me. Then he grinned sourly. \"Nice speech,\" he said. \"Now you\u0027ve got the crap out of your system, let\u0027s get that statement. You want to answer specific questions or just tell it your own way?\" \"I was talking to the birds,\" I said. \"Just to hear the breeze blow. I\u0027m not making any statement. You\u0027re a lawyer and you know I don\u0027t have to.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" he said coolly. \"I know the law. I know police work. I\u0027m offering you a chance to dear yourself. If you doift want it, that\u0027s jake with me too. I can arraign you tomorrow morning at ten A.M and have you set for a preliminary hearing. You may get bail, although I\u0027ll fight it, but if you do, it will be stiff. It\u0027ll cost you plenty. That\u0027s one way we can do it.\" He looked down at a paper on his desk, read it, and turned it face down. \"On what charge?\" I asked him. \"Section thirty-two. Accessory after the fact. A felony. It rates up to a five-spot in Quentin.\" \"Better catch Lennox first,\" I said carefully. Grenz had something and I sensed it in his manner. I didn\u0027t know how much, but he had something all right. He leaned back in his chair and picked up a pen and twirled it slowly between his palms. Then he smiled. He was enjoying himself. \"Lennox is a hard man to hide, Marlowe. With most people you need a photo and a good dear photo.. Not with a guy that has scars all over one side of his face. Not to mention white hair, and not over thirty-five years old. We got four witnesses, maybe more.\" \"Witnesses to what?\" I was tasting something bitter in my mouth, like the bile I had tasted after Captain Gregorius slugged me. That reminded me that my neck was still sore and swollen. I rubbed it gently. \"Don\u0027t be a chump, Marlowe. A San Diego superior court judge and his wife happened to be seeing their son and daughter-in-law off on that plane. All four saw Lennox and the judge\u0027s wife saw the car he came in and who came with him. You don\u0027t have a prayer.\" \"That\u0027s nice,\" I said. \"How did you get to them?\" \"Special bulletin on radio and TV. A full description was all it took. The judge called in.\" \"Sounds good,\" I said judicially. \"But it takes a little more than that, Grenz. You have to catch him and prove he committed a murder. Then you have to prove I knew it.\" He snapped a finger at the back of the telegram. \"I think I will take that drink,\" he said. \"Been working nights too much.\" He opened the drawer and put a bottle and a shot glass on the desk. He poured it full to the brim and knocked it back in a lump. \"Better,\" he said. \"Much better. Sorry I can\u0027t offer you one while you\u0027re in custody.\" He corked the bottle and pushed it away from him, but not out of reach. \"Oh yeah, we got to prove something, you said. Well, it could be we already got a confession, chum. Too bad, huh?\" A small but very cold finger moved the whole length of my spine, like an icy insect crawling. \"So why do you need a statement from me?\" He grinned. \"We like a tidy record. Lennox will be brought back and tried. We need everything we can get. It\u0027s not so much what we want from you as what we might be willing to let you get away with—if you co-operate.\" I stared at him. He did a little paper-fiddling. He moved around in his chair, looked at his bottle, and had to use up a lot of will power not grabbing for it. \"Maybe you\u0027d like the whole libretto,\" he said suddenly with an off-key leer. \"Well, smart guy, just to show you I\u0027m not kidding, here it is.\" I leaned across his deak and he thoughi I was reaching for his bottle. He grabbed it away and put it back in the drawer. I just wanted to drop a stub in his ash tray. I leaned back again and lit another pill. He spoke rapidly. \"Lennox got off the plane at Mazatlán, an airline junction point and a town of about thirty-five thousand. He disappeared for two or three hours. Then a tall man with black hair and a dark skin and what might have been a lot of knife scars booked to Torreón under the name of Silvano Rodriguez. His Spanish was good but not good vough for a man of his name. He was too tall for a Mexican with such dark skin. The pilot turned in a report on him. The cops were tho slow at Torreón. Mex cops are no balls of fire. What they do best is shoot people. By the time they got going the man had chartered a plane and gone on to a little mountain town called Otatoclán, a small time summer resort with a lake. The pilot of the charter plane had trained as a combat pilot in Texas. He spoke good English. Lennox pretended not to catch what he said.\" \"If it was Lennox,\" I put in. \"Wait a while, chum. It was Lennox all right. Okay, he gets off at Otatoclán and registers at the hotel there, this time as Mario de Cerva. He was wearing a gun, a Mauser 7.65, which doesn\u0027t mean too much in Mexico, of course. But the charter pilot thought the guy didn\u0027t seem kosher, so he had a word with the local law. They put Lennox under surveillance. They did some checking with Mexico City and then they moved in.\" Grenz picked up a ruler and sighted along it, a meaningless gesture which kept him from looking at me. I said, \"Uh-huh. Smart boy, your charter pilot, and nice to his customers. The story stinks.\" He looked up at me suddenly. \"What we want,\" he said dryly, \"is a quick trial, a plea of second degree which we will accept. There are some angles we\u0027d rather not go into. After all, the family is pretty influential.\" \"Meaning Harlan Potter.\" He nodded briefly. \"For my money the whole idea is all wet. Springer could have a field day with it. It\u0027s got everything. Sex, scandal, money, beautiful unfaithful wife, wounded war hero husband —I suppose that\u0027s where he got the scars — hell, it would be front page stuff for weeks. Every rag in the country would eat it up. So we shuffle it off to a fast fade.\" He shrugged. \"Okay, if the chief wants it that way, it\u0027s up to him. Do I get that statement?\" He turned to the recording machine which had been humming away softly all this time, with the light showing in front. \"Turn it off,\" I said. He swung around and gave me a vicious look. \"You like it in jail?\" \"It\u0027s not too bad. You don\u0027t meet the best people, but who the hell wants to? Be reasonable, Grenz. You\u0027re trying to make a fink out of me. Maybe I\u0027m obstinate, or even sentimental, but I\u0027m practical too. Suppose you had to hire a private eye — yeah, yeah, I know how you would hate the idea—but just suppose you were where it was your only out. Would you want one that finked on his friends?\" He stared at me with hate. \"A couple more points. Doesn\u0027t it strike you that Lennox\u0027s evasion tactics were just a little too transparent? If he wanted to be caught, he didn\u0027t have to go to all that trouble. If he didn\u0027t want to be caught, he had brains enough not to disguise himself as a Mexican in Mexico.\" \"Meaning what?\" Grenz was snarling at me now. \"Meaning you could just be filling me up with a lot of hooey you made up, that there wasn\u0027t any Rodriguez with dyed hair and there wasn\u0027t any Mario de Cerva at Otatoclan, and you don\u0027t know any more about where Lennox is than where Black Beard the Pirate buried his treasure.\" He got his bottle out again. He poured himself a shot and drank it down quiddy, as before. He relaxed slowly. He turned in his chair and switched off the recording machine. \"I\u0027d like to have tried you,\" he said gratingly. \"You\u0027re the kind of wise guy I like to work over. This rap will be hanging over you for a long long time, cutie. You\u0027ll walk with it and eat with it and sleep with it. And next time you step out of line we\u0027ll murder you with it. Right now I got to do something that turns my guts inside out.\" He pawed on his desk and pulled the face-down paper to him, turned it over and signed it. You can always tell when a man is writing his own name. He has a special way of moving. Then he stood up and marched around the desk and threw the door of his shoe box open and yelled for Spranklin. The fat man came in with his B.O. Grenz gave him the paper. \"I\u0027ve just signed your release order,\" he said. \"I\u0027m a public servant and sometimes I have unpleasant duties. Would you care to know why I signed it?\" I stood up. \"If you want to tell me.\" \"The Lennox case is closed, mister. There ain\u0027t any Lennox case. He wrote out a full confession this afternoon in his hotel room and shot himself. In Otatodan, just like I said.\" I stood there looking at nothing. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Grenz back away slowly as if he thought I might be going to slug him. I must have looked pretty nasty for a moment. Then he was behind his desk again and Spranklin had grabbed onto my arm. \"Come on, move,\" he said in a whining kind of voice. \"Man likes to get to home nights once in a while.\" I went out with him and closed the door. I closed it quietly as if on a room where someone had just died. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49353.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
