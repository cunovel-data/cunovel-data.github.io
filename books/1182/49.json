{"id":45304,"no":49,"title":"chapter 49","content":"When the car stopped out front and the door opened I went out and stood at the top of the steps to call down. But the middle-aged colored driver was holding the door for her to get out. Then he followed her up the steps carrying a small overnight case. So I just waited. She reached the top and turned to the driver: \"Mr. Marlowe will drive me to my hotel, Amos. Thank you for everything. I\u0027ll call you in the morning.\" \"Yes, Mrs. Loring. May I ask Mr. Marlowe a question?\" \"Certainly, Amos.\" He put the overnight case down inside the door and she went in past me and left us. \"\u0027I grow old. . . I grow old. . I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\u0027 What does that mean, Mr. Marlowe?\" \"Not a bloody thing. It just sounds good.\" He smiled. \"That is from the \u0027Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.\u0027 Here\u0027s another one. \u0027In the room the women come and go/Talking of Michael Angelo.\u0027 Does that suggest anything to you, s-fr?\" \"Yeah—it suggests to me that the guy didn\u0027t know very much about women.\" \"My sentiments exactly, sir. Nonetheless I admire T. S. Eliot Very much.\" \"Did you say \u0027nonetheless\u0027?\" \"Why, yes I did. Mr. Marlowe. Is that incorrect?\" \"No, but don\u0027t say it in front of a millionaire. He might think you were giving him the hotfoot.\" He smiled sadly. \"I shouldn\u0027t dream of it. Have you had an accident, sir?\" \"Nope. It was planned that way. Goodnight, Amos.\" \"Goodnight, sir.\" He went back down the steps and I went back into the house. Linda Loring was standing in the middle of the living room looking around her. \"Amos is a graduate of Howard University,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t live in a very safe place—for such an unsafe man, do you?\" \"There aren\u0027t any safe places.\" \"Your poor face. Who did that to you?\" \"Mendy Menendez.\" \"What did you do to him?\" \"Nothing much. Kicked him a time or two. He walked into a trap. He\u0027s on his way to Nevada in the company of three or four tough Nevada deputies. Forget him.\" She sat down on the davenport. \"What would you like to drink?\" I asked. I got a cigarette box and held it out to her. She said she didn\u0027t want to smoke. She said anything would do to drink. \"I thought of champagne,\" I said. \"I haven\u0027t any ice bucket, but it\u0027s cold. I\u0027ve been saving it for years. Two bottles. Cordon Rouge. I guess it\u0027s good. I\u0027m no judge.\" \"Saving it for what?\" she asked. \"For you.\" She smiled, but she was still staring at my face. \"You\u0027re all cut.\" She reached her fingers up and touched my cheek lightly. \"Saving it for me? That\u0027s not very likely. It\u0027s only a couple of months since we met.\" \"Then I was saving it until we met. I\u0027ll go get it.\" I picked up her overnight bag and started across the room with it. \"Just where are you going with that?\" she asked sharply. \"It\u0027s an overnight bag, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Put it down and come back here.\" I did that. Her eyes were bright and at the same time they were sleepy. \"This is something new,\" she said slowly. \"Something quite new.\" \"In what way?\" \"You\u0027ve never laid a finger on me. No passes, no suggestive remarks, no pawing, no nothing. I thought you were tough, sarcastic, mean, and cold.\" \"I guess I am—at times.\" \"Now I\u0027m here and I suppose without preamble, after we have had a reasonable quantity of champagne you plan to grab me and throw me on the bed. Is that it?\" \"Frankly,\" I said, \"some such idea did stir at the back of my mind.\" \"I\u0027m flattered, but suppose I don\u0027t want it that way? I like you. I like you very much. But it doesn\u0027t follow that I want to go to bed with you. Aren\u0027t you rather jumping at conclusions — just because I happen to bring an overnight bag with me?\" \"Could be I made an error,\" I said. I went and got her overnight bag and put it back by the front door. \"I\u0027ll get the champagne.\" \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt your feelings. Perhaps you would rather save the champagne for some more auspicious occasion.\" \"It\u0027s only two bottles,\" I said. \"A really auspicious occasion would call for a dozen.\" \"Oh, I see,\" she said, suddenly angry. \"I\u0027m just to be a fill-in until someone more beautiful and attractive comesalong. Thank you so very much. Now you\u0027ve hurt my feelings, but I suppose it\u0027s something to know that I\u0027m safe here. If you think a bottle of champagne will make a loose woman out of me, I can assure you that you are very much mistaken.\" \"I admitted the mistake already.\" \"The fact that I told you I was going to divorce my husband and that I had Amos drop me by here with an overnight bag doesn\u0027t make me as easy as all that,\" she said, still angry. \"Damn the overnight bag!\" I growled. \"The hell with the overnight bag! Mention it again and I\u0027ll throw the damn thing down the front steps. I asked you to have a drink. I\u0027m going out to the kitchen to get the drink. That\u0027s all. I hadn\u0027t the least idea of getting you drunk. You don\u0027t want to go to bed with me. I understand perfectly. No reason why you should. But we can still have a glass or two of champagne, can\u0027t we? This doesn\u0027t have to be a wrangle about who is going to get seduced and when and where and on how much champagne.\" \"You don\u0027t have to lose your temper,\" she said, flushing. \"That\u0027s just another gambit,\" I snarled. \"I know fifty of them and I hate them all. They\u0027re all phony and they all have a sort of leer at the edges.\" She got up and came over close to me and ran the tips of her fingers gently over the cuts and swollen places on my face. \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m a tired and disappointed woman. Please be kind to me. I\u0027m no bargain to anyone.\" \"You\u0027re not tired and you\u0027re no more disappointed than most people are. By all the rules you ought to be the same sort of shallow spoiled promiscuous brat your sister was. By some miracle you\u0027re not. You\u0027ve got all the honesty and a large part of the guts in your family. You don\u0027t need anyone to be kind to you.\" I turned and walked out of the room down the hall to the kitchen and got one of the bottles of champagne out of the icebox and popped the cork and filled a couple of shallow goblets quickly and drank one down. The sting of it brought tears to my eyes, but I emptied the glass. I filled it again. Then I put the whole works on a tray and carted it into the living room. She wasn\u0027t there. The overnight bag wasn\u0027t there. I put the tray down and opened the front door. I hadn\u0027t heard any sound of its opening and she had no car. I hadn\u0027t heard any sound at all. Then she spoke from behind me. \"Idiot, did you think I was going to run away?\" I shut the door and turned. She had loosened her hair and she had tufted slippers on her bare feet and a silk robe the color of a sunset in a Japanese print. She came towards me slowly with a sort of unexpectedly shy smile. I held a glass out to her. She took it, took a couple of sips of the champagne, and handed it back. \"It\u0027s very nice,\" she said. Then very quietly and without a trace of acting or affectation she came into my arms and pressed her mouth against mine and opened her lips and her teeth. The tip of her tongue touched mine. After a long time she pulled her head back but kept her arms around my neck. She was starry-eyed. \"I meant to all the time,\" she said. \"I just had to be difficult. I don\u0027t know why. Just nerves perhaps. I\u0027m not really a loose woman at all. Is that a pity?\" \"If I had thought you were I\u0027d have made a pass at you the first time I met you in the bar at Victor\u0027s.\" She shook her head slowly and smiled. \"I don\u0027t think so. That\u0027s why I am here.\" \"Perhaps not that night,\" I said. \"That night belonged to something else.\" \"Perhaps you don\u0027t ever make passes at women in bars.\" \"Not often. The light\u0027s too dim.\" \"But a lot of women go to bars just to have passes made at them.\" \"A lot of women get up in the morning with the same idea.\" \"But liquor is an aphrodisiac—up to a point.\" \"Doctors recommend it.\" \"Who said anything about doctors? I want my diampagne.\" I kissed her some more. It was light, pleasant work. \"I want to kiss your poor cheek,\" she said, and did. \"It\u0027s burning hot,\" she said. \"The rest of me is freezing.\" \"It is not. I want my champagne.\" \"Why?\" \"It\u0027ll get flat if we don\u0027t drink it. Besides I like the taste of it.\" \"All right.\" \"Do you love me very much? Or will you if I go to bed with you?\" \"Possibly.\" \"You don\u0027t have to go to bed with me, you know. I don\u0027t absolutely insist on it.\" \"Thank you.\" \"I want my champagne.\" \"How much money have you got?\" \"Altogether? How would I know? About eight million dollars.\" \"I\u0027ve decided to go to bed with you.\" \"Mercenary,\" she said. \"I paid for the champagne.\" \"The hell with the champagne,\" she said. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49393.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
