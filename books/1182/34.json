{"id":45289,"no":34,"title":"chapter 34","content":"The stretch of broken-paved road from the highway to the curve of the hill was dancing in the noon heat and the scrub that dotted the parched land on both sides of it was flour-white with granite dust by this time. The weedy smell was almost nauseating. A thin hot acrid breeze was blowing. I had my coat off and my sleeves rolled up, but the door was too hot to rest an arm on. A tethered horse dozed wearily under a dump of live oaks. A brown Mexican sat on the ground and ate something out of a newspaper. A tumbleweed rolled lazily across the road and came to rest against a piece of granite outcrop, and a lizard that had been there an instant before disappeared without seeming to move at all. Then I was around the hill on the blacktop and in another country. In five minutes I turned into the driveway of the Wades\u0027 house, parked and walked across the flagstones and rang the bell. Wade answered the door himself, in a brown and white checked shirt with short sleeves, pale blue denim slacks, and house slippers. He looked tanned and he looked good. There was an i.kstain on his hand and a smear of cigarette ash on one side of his nose. He led the way into his study and parked himself behind his desk. On it there was a thick pile of yellow typescript. I put my coat on a chair and sat on the couch. \"Thanks for coming, Marlowe. Drink?\" I got that look on my face you get when a drunk asks you to have a drink. I could feel it. He grinned. \"I\u0027ll have a coke,\" he said. \"You pick up fast,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think I want a drink right now. I\u0027ll take a coke with you.\" He pressed something with his foot and after a while Candy came. He looked surly. He had a blue shirt on and an orange scarf and no white coat. Two-tone black and white shoes, elegant high-wasted gabardine pants. Wade ordered the cokes. Candy gave me a hard stare and went away. \"Book?\" I said, pointing to the stack of paper. \"Yeah. Stinks.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it. How far along?\" \"About two thirds of the way — for what it\u0027s worth. Which is damn little. You know how a writer can tell when he\u0027s washed up?\" \"Don\u0027t know anything about writers.\" I filled my pipe, \"When he starts reading his old stuff for inspiration. That\u0027s absolute. I\u0027ve got five hundred pages of typescript here, well over a hundred thousand words. My books run long. The public likes long books. The damn fool public thinks if there\u0027s a lot of pages there must be a lot of gold. I don\u0027t dare read it over. And I can\u0027t remember half of what\u0027s in it. I\u0027m just plain scared to look at my own work.\" \"You look good yourself,\" I said. \"From the other night I wouldn\u0027t have believed it. You\u0027ve got more guts than you think you have.\" \"What I need right now is more than guts. Something you don\u0027t get by wishing for it. A belief in yourself. I\u0027m a spoiled writer who doesn\u0027t believe any more. I have a beautiful home, a beautiful wife, and a beautiful sales record. But all I really want is to get drunk and forget.\" He leaned his chin in his cupped hands and stared across the desk. \"Eileen said I tried to shoot myself. Was it that bad?\" \"You don\u0027t remember?\" He shook his head. \"Not a damn thing except that I fell down and cut my head. And after a while I was in bed., And you were there. Did Eileen call you?\" \"Yeah. Didn\u0027t she say?\" \"She hasn\u0027t been talking to me very much this last week. I guess she\u0027s had it. Up to here.\" He put the edge of one hand against his neck just under his chin. \"That show Loring put on here didn\u0027t help any.\" \"Mrs. Wade said it meant nothing.\" \"Well, she would, wouldn\u0027t she? It happened to be the truth, but I don\u0027t suppose she believed it when she said it. The guy is just abnormally jealous. You have a drink or two with his wife in the corner and laugh a little and kiss her goodbye and right off he assumes you are sleeping with her. One reason being that he isn\u0027t.\" \"What I like about Idle Valley,\" I said, \"is that everybody is living just a comfortable normal life.\" He frowned and then the door opened and Candy came in with two cokes and glasses and poured the cokes. He set one in front of me without looking at me. \"Lunch in half an hour,\" Wade said, \"and where\u0027s the white coat?\" \"This my day off,\" Candy said, deadpan. \"I ain\u0027t the cook, boss.\" \"Cold cuts or sandwiches and beer will do,\" Wade said. \"The cook\u0027s off today, Candy. I\u0027ve got a friend to lunch.\" \"You think he is your friend?\" Candy sneered. \"Better ask your wife.\" Wade leaned back in his chair and smiled at hint. \"Watch your lip, little man. You\u0027ve got it soft here. I don\u0027t often ask a favor of you, do I?\" Candy looked down at the floor. After a moment he looked up and grinned., \"Okay, boss. I put the white coat on. I get the lunch, I guess.\" He turned softly and went out. Wade watched the door close. Then he shrugged and looked at me. \"We used to call them servants. Now we call them domestic help. I wonder how long it will be before we have to give them breakfast in bed. I\u0027m paying the guy too much money. He\u0027s spoiled.\" \"Wages—or something on the side?\" \"Such as what?\" he asked sharply. I got up and handed him some folded yellow sheets. \"you\u0027d better read it. Evidently you don\u0027t remember asking me to tear it up. It was in your typewriter, under the cover.\" He unfolded the yellow pages and leaned back to read them. The glass of coke fizzed unnoticed on the desk in front of him. He read slowly, frowning. When he came to the end he refolded the sheets and ran a finger along the edge. \"Did Eileen see this?\" he asked carefully. \"I wouldn\u0027t know. She might have.\" \"Pretty wild, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I liked it. Especially the part about a good man dying for you.\" He opened the paper again and tore it into long strips viciously and dumped the strips into his wastebasket. \"I suppose a drunk will write or say or do anything,\" he said slowly. \"It\u0027s meaningless to me. Candy\u0027s not blackmailing me. He likes me.\" \"Maybe you\u0027d better get drunk again. You might remember what you meant. You might remember a lot of things. We\u0027ve been through this before — that night when the gun went off. I suppose the seconal blanked you out too. You sounded sober enough. But now you pretend not to remember writing that stuff I just gave you. No wonder you can\u0027t write your book, Wade. It\u0027s a wonder you can stay alive.\" He reached sideways and opened a drawer of his desk. His hand fumbled in it and came up with a three-decker check book. He opened it and reached for a pen. \"I owe you a thousand dollars,\" he said quietly. He wrote in the book. Then on the counterfoil. He tore the check out, came around the desk with it, and dropped it in front of me. \"Is that all right?\" I leaned back and looked up at him and didn\u0027t touch the check and didn\u0027t answer him. His face was tight and drawn. His eyes were deep and empty. \"I suppose you think I killed her and let Lennox take the rap,\" he said slowly. \"She was a tramp all right. But you don\u0027t beat a woman\u0027s head in just because she\u0027s a tramp. Candy knows I went there sometimes. The funny part of it is I don\u0027t think he would tell. I could be wrong, but I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t matter if he did,\" I said. \"Harlan Potter\u0027s Mends wouldn\u0027t listen to him. Also, she wasn\u0027t killed with that bronze thing. She was shot through the head with her own gun.\" \"She maybe had a gun,\" he said almost dreamily. \"But I didn\u0027t know she had been shot. It wasn\u0027t published.\" \"Didn\u0027t know or didn\u0027t remember?\" I asked him. \"No, it wasn\u0027t published.\" \"What are you trying to do to me, Marlowe?\" His voice was still dreamy, almost gentle. \"What do you want me to do? Tell my wife? Tell the police? What good would it do?\" \"You said a good man died for you.\" \"All I meant was that if there had been any real investigation I might have been identified aS one—but only one—of the possible suspects. It would have finished me in several ways.\" \"I didn\u0027t come here to accuse you of a murder, Wade. What\u0027s eating you is that you\u0027re not sure yourself. You have a record of violence to your wife. You black out when you\u0027re drunk. It\u0027s no argument to say you don\u0027t beat a woman\u0027s head in just because she\u0027s a tramp. That is exactly what somebody did do. And the guy who got credit for the job seemed to me a lot less likely than you.\" He walked to the open french windows and stood looking out at \u0027the shimmer of heat over the lake. He didn\u0027t answer me. He hadn\u0027t moved or spoken a couple of minutes later when there was a light knock at the door and Candy came in wheeling a tea wagon, with a crisp white cloth, silver-covered dishes, a pot of coffee, and two bottles of beer. \"Open the beer, boss?\" he asked Wade\u0027s back. \"Bring me a bottle of whiskey.\" Wade didn\u0027t turn around. \"Sorry, boss. No whiskey.\" Wade spun around and yelled at him, but Candy didn\u0027t budge. He looked down at the check lying on the cocktail table and his head twisted as he read it. Then he looked up at me and hissed something between his teeth. Then he looked at Wade. \"I go now. This my day off.\" He turned and went. Wade laughed. \"So I get it myself,\" he said sharply, and went. I lifted one of the covers and saw some neatly trimmed three-cornered sandwiches.\u0027 I took one and poured some beer and ate the sandwich standing up. Wade came back with a bottle and a glass. He Sat down on the couch and poured a stiff jolt and sucked it down. There was the sound of a car going away from the house, probably Candy leaving by the service driveway. I took another sandwich. \"Sit down and make yourself comfortable,\" Wade said. \"We have all afternoon to kill.\" He had a glow on already. His voice was vibrant and cheerful. \"You don\u0027t like me, do you, Marlowe?\" \"That question has already been asked and answered.\" \"Know something? You\u0027re a pretty ruthless son of a bitch. You\u0027d do anything to find what you want. You\u0027d even make love to my wife while I was helpless drunk in the next room.\" \"You believe everything that knife thrower tells you?\" He poured some more whiskey into his glass and held it up against the light. \"Not everything, no. A pretty color whiskey is, isn\u0027t it? To drown in a golden flood—that\u0027s not so bad. \u0027To cease upon the midnight with no pain.\u0027 How does that go on? Oh, sorry, you wouldn\u0027t know. Too literary. You\u0027re some kind of a dick, aren\u0027t you? Mind telling me why you\u0027re here.\" He drank some more whiskey and grinned at me. Then he spotted the check lying on the table. He reached for it and read it over his glass. \"Seems to be made out to somebody named Marlowe. 1 wonder why, what for. Seems I signed it. Foolish of me, I\u0027m a gullible chap.\" \"Stop acting,\" I said roughly. \"Where\u0027s your wife?\" He looked up politely, \"My wife will be home in due course. No doubt by that time I shall be passed out and she can entertain you at her leisure. The house will be yours.\" \"Where\u0027s the gun?\" I asked suddenly. He looked blank. I told him I had put it in his desk. \"Not there now, I\u0027m sure,\" he said. \"You may search if it pleases you. Just don\u0027t steal any rubber bands.\" I went to the desk and frisked it. No gun. That was something. Probably Eileen had hidden it. \"Look, Wade, I asked you where your wife was. I think she ought to come home. Not for my benefit, friend, for yours. Somebody has to look out for you, and I\u0027ll be goddamned if it\u0027s going to be me.\" He stared vaguely. He was still holding the check. He put his glass down and, tore the check across, then again and again, and let the pieces fall to the floor. \"Evidently the amount was too small,\" he said. \"Your services come very high. Even a thousand dollars and my wife fail to satisfy you. Too bad, but I can\u0027t go any higher. Except on this.\" He patted the bottle. \"I\u0027m leaving,\" I said. \u0027But why? You wanted me to remember. Well—here in the bottle is my memory. Stick around, pal. When I get lit enough I\u0027ll tell you about all the women I have murdered.\" \"All right, Wade. I\u0027ll stick around for a while. But not in here. If you need me, just smash a chair against the wall.\" I went out and left the door open. I walked across the big living room and out to the patio and pulled one of the chaises into the shadow of the overhang and stretched out on it. Across the lake there was a blue hare against the hills. The ocean breeze had begun to filter through the low mountains to the west. It wiped the air clean and it wiped away just enough of the heat. Idle Valley was having a perfect summer. Somebody had planned it that way. Paradise Incorporated, and also Highly Restricted. Only the nicest people. Absolutely no Central Europeans. Just the cream, the top drawer crowd, the lovely, lovely people. Like the Lorings and the Wades. Pure gold. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49378.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
