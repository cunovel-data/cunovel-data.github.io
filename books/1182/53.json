{"id":45308,"no":53,"title":"chapter 53","content":"They had done a wonderful job on him in Mexico City, but why not? Their doctors, technicians, hospitals, painters, architects are as good as ours. Sometimes a little better. A Mexican cop invented the paraffin test for powder nitrates. They couldn\u0027t make Terry\u0027s face perfect, but they had done plenty. They had even changed his nose, taken out some bone and made it look flatter, less Nordic. They couldn\u0027t eliminate every trace of a scar, so they had put a couple on the other side of his face too. Knife scars are not uncommon in Latin countries. \"They even did a nerve graft up here,\" he said, and touched what had been the bad side of his face. \"How close did I come?\" \"Close enough. A few details wrong, but they are not important. It was a quick deal and some of it was improvised and I didn\u0027t know myself just what was going to happen. I was told to do certain things and to leave a clear trail. Mendy didn\u0027t like my writing to you, but I held out for that. He undersold you a little. He never noticed the bit about the mailbox.\" \"You know who killed Sylvia?\" He didn\u0027t answer me directly. \"It\u0027s pretty tough to turn a woman in for murder—even if she never meant much to you.\" \"It\u0027s a tough world. Was Harlan Potter in on all this?\" He smiled again. \"Would he be likely to let anyone know that? My guess is not. My guess is he thinks I am dead. Who would tell him otherwise—unless you did?\" \"What I\u0027d tell him you could fold into a blade of grass. How\u0027s Mendy these days—or is he?\" \"He\u0027s doing all right. In Acapulco. He slipped by because of Randy. But the boys don\u0027t go for rough work on cops. Mendy\u0027s not as bad as you think. He has a heart.\" \"So has a snake.\" \"Well, what about that gimlet?\" I got up without answering him and went to the safe. I spun the knob and got out the envelope with the portrait of Madison on it and the five C notes that smelled of coffee. I dumped the lot out on the desk and then picked up the five C notes. \"These I keep. I spent almost all of it on expenses and research. The portrait of Madison I enjoyed playing with, It\u0027s all yours now.\" I spread it on the edge of the desk in front of him. He looked at it but didn\u0027t touch it. \"It\u0027s yours to keep,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got plenty. You could have let things lie.\" \"I know. After she killed her husband and got away with it she might have gone on to better things. He was of no real importance, of course. Just a human being with blood and a brain and emotions. He knew what happened too and he tried pretty hard to live with it. He wrote books. You may have heard of him.\" \"Look, I couldn\u0027t very well help what I did,\" he said slowly. \"I didn\u0027t want anyone to get hurt. I wouldn\u0027t have had a dog\u0027s chance up here. A man can\u0027t figure every angle that quick. I was scared and I ran. What should I have done?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"She had a mad streak. She might have killed him anyway.\" \"Yeah, she might.\" \"Well, thaw out a little. Let\u0027s go have a drink somewhere where it\u0027s cool and quiet.\" \"No time right now, Se.or Maioranos.\" \"We were pretty good friends once,\" he said unhappily. \"Were we? I forget. That was two other fellows, seems to me. You permanently in Mexico?\" \"Oh yes. I\u0027m not here legally even. I never was. I told you I was born in Salt Lake City. I was born in MontreaL I\u0027ll be a Mexican national pretty soon now. All it takes is a good lawyer. I\u0027ve always liked Mexico. It wouldn\u0027t be much risk going to Victor\u0027s for that gimlet.\" \"Pick up your money, Se.or Maioranos. It has too much blood on it.\" \"You\u0027re a poor man.\" \"How would you know?\" He picked the bill up and stretched it between his thin fingers and slipped it casually into an inside pocket. He bit his lip with the very white teeth you can have when you have a brown skin. \"I couldn\u0027t tell you any more than I did that morning you drove me to Tijuana. I gave you a chance to call the law and turn me in.\" \"I\u0027m not sore at you. You\u0027re just that kind of guy. For a long time I couldn\u0027t figure you at all. You had nice ways and nice qualities, but there was something wrong. You had standards and you lived up to them, but they were personal. They had no relation to any kind of ethics or scruples. You were a nice guy because you had a nice nature. But you were just as happy with mugs or hoodlums as with honest men. Provided the hoodlums spoke fairly good English and had fairly acceptable table manners. You\u0027re a moral defeatist. I think maybe the war did it and again I think maybe-you were born that way.\" \"I don\u0027t get it,\" he said. \"I really don\u0027t. I\u0027m trying to pay you back and you won\u0027t let me. I couldn\u0027t have told you any more than I did. You wouldn\u0027t have stood for it.\" \"That\u0027s as nice a thing as was ever said to me.\" \"I\u0027m glad you like something about me. I got in a bad jam. I happened to know the sort of people who know how to deal with bad jams. They owed me for an incident that happened long ago in the war. Probably the only time in my life I ever did the right thing quick like a mouse. And when I needed them, they delivered. And for free. You\u0027re not the only guy in the world that has no price tag, Marlowe.\" He leaned across the desk and snapped at one of my cigarettes. There was an uneven flush on his face under the deep tan. The scars showed up against it. I watched him spring a fancy gas cartridge lighter loose from a pocket and light the cigarette. I got a whiff of perfume from him. \"You bought a lot of me, Terry. For a smile and a nod and a wave of the hand and a few quiet drinks in a quiet bar here and there. It was nice while it lasted. So long, amigo. I won\u0027t say goodbye. I said it to you when it meant something. I said it when it was sad and lonely and final.\" \"I came back too late,\" he said. \"These plastic jobs take time.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t have come at all if I hadn\u0027t smoked you out.\" There was suddenly a glint of tears in his eyes. He put his dark glasses back on quickly. \"I wasn\u0027t sure about it,\" he said. \"I hadn\u0027t made up my mind. They didn\u0027t want me to tell you anything. I just hadn\u0027t made up my mind.\" \"Don\u0027t worry about it, Terry. There\u0027s always somebody around to do it for you.\" \"I was in the Commandos, bud. They don\u0027t take you if you\u0027re just a piece of fluff. I got badly hurt and it wasn\u0027t any fun with those Nazi doctors. It did something to me.\" \"I know all that, Terry. You\u0027re a very sweet guy in a lot of ways. I\u0027m not judging you. I never did. It\u0027s just that you\u0027re not here any more. You\u0027re long gone. You\u0027ve got nice clothes and perfume and you\u0027re as elegant as a fifty-dollar whore.\" \"That\u0027s just an act,\" he said almost desperately. \"You get a kick out of it, don\u0027t you?\" His mouth dropped in a sour smile. He shrugged an expressive energetic Latin shrug. \"Of course. An act is all there is. There isn\u0027t anything else. In here— \" he tapped his chest with the lighter—\"there isn\u0027t anything. I\u0027ve had it, Marlowe. I had it long ago. Well—I guess that winds things up.\" He stood up. I stood up. He put out a lean hand. I shook it. \"So long, Se.or Maioranos. Nice to have known you — however briefly.\" \"Goodbye.\" He turned and walked across the floor and out. I watched the door close. I listened to his steps going away down the imitation marble corridor. After a while they got faint, then they got silent. I kept on listening anyway. What for? Did I want him to stop suddenly and turn and come back and talk me out of the way I felt? Well, he didn\u0027t. That was the last I saw of him. I never saw any of them again — except the cops. No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them. \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49397.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
