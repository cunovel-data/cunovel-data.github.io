{"id":45259,"no":4,"title":"chapter 4","content":"The last time we had a drink in a bar was in May and it was earlier than usual, just after four o\u0027clock. He looked tired and thinner but he looked around with a slow smile of pleasure. \"I like bars just after they open for the evening. When the air inside is still cool and clean and everything is shiny and the barkeep is giving himself that last look in the mirror to see if his tie is straight and his hair is smooth. I like the neat bottles on the bar back and the lovely shining glasses and the anticipation. I like to watch the man mix the first one of the evening and put it down on a crisp mat and put the little folded napkin beside it. I like to taste it slowly. The first quiet drink of the evening in a quiet bar—that\u0027s wonderful,\" I agreed with him. \"Alcohol is like love,\" he said. \"The first kiss is magic, the second is intimate, the third is routine. After that you take the girl\u0027s clothes off.\" \"Is that bad?\" I asked him. \"It\u0027s excitement of a high order, but it\u0027s an impure emotion—impure in the aesthetic sense. I\u0027m not sneering at sex. It\u0027s necessary and it doesn\u0027t have to be ugly. But it always has to be managed. Making it glamorous is a billion-dollar industry and it costs every cent of it.\" He looked around and yawned. \"I haven\u0027t been sleeping well. It\u0027s nice in here. But after a while the lushes will fill the place up and talk loud and laugh and the goddain women will start waving their hands and screwing up their faces and tinkling their goddam bracelets and making with the packaged charm which will later on in the evening have a slight but unmistakable odor of sweat.\" \"Take it easy,\" I said. \"So they\u0027re human, they sweat, they get dirty, they have to go to the bathroom. What did you expect — golden butterflies hovering in a rosy mist?\" He emptied his glass and held it upside down and watched a slow drop form on the rim and then tremble and fall. \"I\u0027m sorry for her,\" he said slowly. \"She\u0027s such an absolute bitch. Could be I\u0027m fond of her too in a remote sort of way. Some day she\u0027ll need me and I\u0027ll be the only guy around not holding a chisel. Likely enough then I\u0027ll flunk out.\" I just looked at him. \"You do a great job of selling yourself,\" I said after a moment. \"Yeah, I know. I\u0027m a weak character, without guts or ambition. I caught the brass ring and it shocked me to find out it wasn\u0027t gold. A guy like me has one big moment in his life, one perfect swing on the high trapeze. Then he spends the rest of his time trying not to fall off the sidewalk into the gutter.\" \"What\u0027s this in favor of?\" I got out a pipe and started to fill it. \"She\u0027s scared. She\u0027s scared stiff.\" \"What of?\" \"I don\u0027t know. We don\u0027t talk much any more. Maybe of the old man. Harlan Potter is a coldhearted son of a bitch. All Victorian dignity on the outside. Inside he\u0027s as ruthless as a Gestapo thug. Sylvia is a tramp. He knows it and he hates it and there\u0027s nothing he can do about it. But he waits and he watches and if Sylvia ever gets into a big mess of scandal he\u0027ll break her in half and bury the two halves a thousand miles apart.\" \"You\u0027re her husband.\" He lifted the empty glass and brought it down hard on the edge of the table. It smashed with a sharp ping. The barman stared, but didn\u0027t say anything. \"Like that, chum. Like that. Oh sure, I\u0027m her husband. That\u0027s what the record says. I\u0027m the three white steps and the big green front door and the brass knocker you rap one long and two short and the maid lets you into the hundreddollar whorehouse.\" I stood up and dropped some money on the table. \"You talk too damn much,\" I said, \"and it\u0027s too damn much about you. See you later.\" I walked out leaving him sitting there shocked and white-faced as well as I could tell by the kind of light they have in bars. He called something after me, but I kept going. Ten minutes later I was sorry. But ten minutes later I was somewere else. He didn\u0027t come to the office any more, Not at all, not once. I had got to him where it hurt. I didn\u0027t see him again for a month. When I did it was five o\u0027clock in the morning and just beginning to get light. The persistent ringing of the doorbell yanked me out of bed. I plowed down the hall and across the living room and opened up. He stood there looking as if he hadn\u0027t slept for a week. He had a light topcoat on with the collar turned up and he seemed to be shivering. A dark felt hat was pulled down over his eyes. He had a gun in his hand. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49348.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
