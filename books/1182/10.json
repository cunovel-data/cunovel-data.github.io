{"id":45265,"no":10,"title":"chapter 10","content":"I dug out the carbon of my property slip and turned it over and receipted on the original. I put my belongings back in my pockets. There was a man draped over the end of the booking desk and as I turned away he straightened up and spoke to me. He was about six feet four inches tall and as thin as a wire. \"Need a ride home?\" In the bleak light he looked young-old, tired and cynical, but he didn\u0027t look like a grifter. \"For how much?\" \"For free. I\u0027m Lonnie Morgan of the Journal. I\u0027m knocking off.\" \"Oh, police beat,\" I said. \"Just this week. The City Hall is my regular beat.\" We walked out of the building and found his car in the parking lot. I looked up at the sky. There were stars but there was too much glare. It was a cool pleasant night. I breathed it in. Then I got into his car and he drove away from there. \"I live way out in Laurel Canyon,\" I said. \"Just drop me anywhere.\" \"They ride you in,\" he said, \"but they don\u0027t worry how you get home. This case interests me, in a repulsive sort of way.\" \"It seems there isn\u0027t any case,\" I said. \"Terry Lennox shot himself this afternoon. So they say. So they say.\" \"Very convenient,\" Lonnie Morgan said, staring ahead through the windshield. His car drifted quietly along quiet streets. \"It helps them build their wall.\" \"What wall?\" \"Somebody\u0027s building a wall around the Lennox case, Marlowe. You\u0027re smart enough to see that, aren\u0027t you? It\u0027s not getting the kind of play it rates, The D.A. left town tonight for Washington. Some kind of convention. He walked out on the sweetest hunk of publicity he\u0027s had in years. Why?\" \"No use to ask me. I\u0027ve been in cold storage.\" \"Because somebody made it worth his while, that\u0027s why. I don\u0027t mean anything crude like a wad of dough. Somebody promised him something important to him and there\u0027s only one man connected with the case in a position to do that. The girl\u0027s father.\" I leaned my head back in a corner of the car. \"Sounds a little unlikely,\" I said. \"What about the press? Harlan Potter owns a few papers, but what about the competition?\" He gave me a brief amused glance and then concentrated on his driving. \"Ever been a newspaperman?\" \"No.\" \"Newspapers are owned and published by rich men. Rich men all belong to the same club. Sure, there\u0027s competition — hard tough competition for circulation, for newsbeats, for exclusive stories. Just so long as it doesn\u0027t damage the prestige and privilege and position of the owners. If it does, down comes the lid. The lid, my friend, is down on the Lennox case. The Lennox case, my friend, properly built up, could have sold a hell of a lot of papers. It has everything. The trial would have drawn feature writers from all over the country. But there ain\u0027t going to be no trial. On account of Lennox checked out before it could get moving. Like I said —very convenient —for Harlan Potter and his family.\" I straightened up and gave him a hard stare. \"You calling the whole thing a fix?\" He twisted his mouth sardonically. \"Could just be Lennox had some help committing suicide. Resisting arrest a little. Mexican cops have very itchy trigger fingers. If you want to lay a little bet, I\u0027ll give you nice odds that nobody gets to count the bullet holes.\" \"I think you\u0027re wrong,\" I said. \"I knew Terry Lennox pretty well. He wrote himself off a long time ago. If they brought him back alive, he would have let them have it their way. He\u0027d have copped a manslaughter plea.\" Lonnie Morgan shook his head. I knew what he was going to say and he said it. \"Not a chance. If he had shot her or cracked her skull, maybe yes. But there was too much brutality. Her face was beaten to a pulp. Second degree murder would be the best he could get, and even that would raise a stink.\" I said: \"You could be right.\" He looked at me again. \"You say you knew the guy. Do you go for the setup?\" \"I\u0027m tired. I\u0027m not in a thinking mood tonight.\" There was a long pause. Then Lonnie Morgan said quietly: \"If I was a real bright guy instead of a hack newspaperman, I\u0027d think maybe he didn\u0027t kill her at all.\" \"It\u0027s a thought.\" He stuck a cigarette in his mouth and lit it by scratching a match on the dashboard. He smoked silently with a fixed frown on his thin face. We reached Laurel Canyon and I told him where to turn off the boulevard and where to turn into my street. His car churned up the hill and stopped at the foot of my redwood steps. I got out. \"Thanks for the ride, Morgan. Care for a drink?\" \"I\u0027ll take a rain check. I figure you\u0027d rather be alone.\" \"I\u0027ve got lots of time to be alone. Too damn much.\" \"You\u0027ve got a friend to say goodbye to,\" he said. \"He must have been that if you let them toss you into the can on his account.\" \"Who said I did that?\" He smiled faintly. \"Just because I can\u0027t print it don\u0027t mean I didn\u0027t know it, chum. So long. See you around.\" I shut the car door and he turned and drove off down the hill. When his tail lights vanished around the corner I climbed the steps, picked up newspapers, and let myself into the empty house. I put all the lamps on and opened all the windows. The place was stuffy. I made some coffee and drank it and took the five Cnotes out of the toffee can. They were rolled tight and pushed down into the coffee at the side. I walked up and down with a cup of coffee in my hand, turned the TV on, turned it off, sat, stood, and sat again. I read through the papers that had piled up on the front steps. The Lennox case started out big, but by that morning it was a Part Two item. There was a photo of Sylvia, but none of Terry. There was a snap of me that I didn\u0027t know existed. \"L.A. Private Detective Held for Questioning.\" There was a large photo of the Lennox home in Encino. It was pseudo English with a lot of peaked roof and it would have cost a hundred bucks to wash the windows. It stood on a knoll in a big two acres, which is a lot of real estate for the Los Angeles area. There was a photo of the guest house, which was a miniature of the main building. It was hedged in with trees. Both photos had obviously been taken from some distance off and then blown up and trimmed, There was no photo of what the papers called the \"death room.\" I had seen all this stuff before, in jail, but I read it and looked at it again with different eyes. It told me nothing except that a rich and beautiful girl had been murdered and the press had been pretty thoroughly excluded. So the influence had started to work very early. The crime beat boys must have gnashed their teeth and gnashed them in vain. It figured. If Terry talked to his father-in-law in Pasadena the very night she was killed, there would have been a dozen guards on the estate before the police were even notified. But there was something that didn\u0027t figure at all —the way she had been beaten up. Nobody could sell me that Terry had done that. I put the lamps out and sat by an open window. Outsidein a bush a mockingbird ran through a few trills and admired himself before settling down for the night. My neck itched, so I shaved and showered and went to bed and lay on my back listening, as if far off in the dark I might hear a voice, the kind of calm and patient voice that makes everything clear. I didn\u0027t hear it and I knew I wasn\u0027t going to. Nobody was going to explain the Lennox case to me. No explanation was necessary. The murderer had confessed and he was dead. There wouldn\u0027t even be an inquest. As Lonnie Morgan of the Journal had remarked—very convenient. If Terry Lennox had killed his wife, that was fine. There was no need to try him and bring out all the unpleasant details. If he hadn\u0027t killed her, that was fine too. A dead man is the best fall guy in the world. He never talks back. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675/49354.html","bookId":1182,"book":{"id":1182,"title":"The Long Goodbye 漫长的告别","description":"简介： Raymond Chandler是世界小说史上最伟大的名字之一。他是艾略特、加谬、钱钟书、村上春树等文学大师最崇拜的小说家。被称为文学大师崇拜的大师。他是世界上唯一一位被写入经典文学史册的侦探小说大师。他的作品被收录到《美国文库一》中。他共创作了七部长篇小说和20部左...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/16/10-52-07-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1675","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
