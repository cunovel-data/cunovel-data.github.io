But let’s not forget that I know all about you and your family. If anyone comes asking questions about what happened to Reginald Hale, or your uncle, for that matter, they are going to find a very thick file full of very nasty secrets. Take it from someone who has been cleaning up Hale family messes his whole life: let it go.”\n “Oh, that’s okay.” Kat felt the rock and sway of the train, held on to the back of one of the seats to stay upright. “I don’t think anyone is going to be too concerned about Reginald, considering he’s been dead for fifty years.”\n “But…” The man’s eyes went wide and his voice trailed off when the door at the back of the car slid open.\n “You mean him?” Kat asked, pointing over her shoulder, and for a moment the attorney was so quiet that Kat had to wonder if Garrett even recognized Uncle Eddie.\n Gone were Reginald’s clothes and his cane. He’d traded his limp for slightly inferior posture, and there was no way the man walking down the aisle would ever be confused with a member of the Hale family. He looked like a man who missed his stove and his kitchen. But he was also a man who was very much alive.\n “You…” Garrett muttered. “You’re dead. I saw you at the bottom of a cliff.”\n “Did you?” Eddie asked as, behind him, the door slid open once again and Eddie’s twin brother, Charlie, came to stand beside him. “Did you really?”\n The man stumbled to his feet. “Get them,” he told the guard who sat in the next row. “Stop them.”\n “See…” The goon stood and spoke with a deep Scottish brogue. “I probably shouldn’t do that. It would set a terrible example for my boys. Hey”—he looked at Kat—“where are Angus and Hamish?”\n “Don’t worry, Uncle Roy. They’ll meet up with us in a bit. I had a little errand for them.” Then Kat seemed to notice the look on Garrett’s face. “What?” she asked him. “I thought you knew.… I have a very large family.”\n “So?” The man choked out a laugh. “It doesn’t change anything. The prototype is gone, and I still know where all the Hale family skeletons are buried. If you try to follow me, your family will regret it.”\n “No”—Hale stepped closer, leaning over the cowering man—“you don’t get it.” When the train began to slow again, Hale glanced out the window. “This is our stop.”\n A moment later, several men with badges were walking toward the car. Kat actually waved at the woman leading the group.\n “See,” she said, “that’s my friend at Interpol. I told her all about you, and she’s here to have a chat.”\n But Garrett didn’t tremble. Instead, he actually huffed. “I’m an attorney, Miss Bishop. I haven’t broken any Swiss laws.”\n Kat smiled. Hale chuckled. The two of them shared an Oh, isn’t he adorable glance before Hale said, “Then it’s a good thing we aren’t in Switzerland, isn’t it?”\n “What…what do you mean?”\n “There was a problem with the tracks, and we got diverted. We crossed the border into France twenty minutes ago.”\n Outside, Angus and Hamish waved at their father through the window.\n “You know my uncle Roy, but I don’t think you’ve met his sons.” Kat pointed at the pair through the glass. “What they do best is blow things up.”\n “Things like train tracks,” Hale said.\n “Mr. Garrett?” Amelia Bennett was walking down the aisle toward them. She didn’t even glance at Charlie or Eddie. She just gave a little nod to Kat and Hale, and turned her full attention to the man in the hat.\n “I have some questions about the death of Hazel Hale, among other things.”\n That Interpol’s senior liaison to the European Union was there that day to handle the matter was something no one really questioned. It was her tip. Her call. And if she chose not to interview the other people on the train, that too was her decision.\n So the passengers of the 12:10 to Geneva were free to climb from the car and out onto the platform without a question or a doubt. And no one from Interpol said a word as perhaps the greatest thieves in the world walked out of the station and blew to the far corners of the earth.\n Chapter 46\n Walking toward the private plane with Gabrielle and W. W. Hale the Fifth, Kat should have felt at least a little bit nostalgic. It was a familiar feeling, so she slipped her hand through his arm and tried to enjoy the moment—to tell herself that things were finally back to normal. But then Hale stopped.\n “What are you doing?” she asked.\n “I’m just trying to enjoy this while it lasts.”\n “Why?” she said. “Are you planning on an early retirement?”\n “No.” He shook his head and laughed. “It’s just that the jet belongs to Hale Industries, and Hale Industries is over.” He sighed. “But on the upside, I guess we’re getting ready to find out if you really only love me for my jet.”\n “I might love you for your jet,” Gabrielle said, straight-faced.\n He smiled at Kat. “What about you?”\n “Yeah,” Kat said, nodding. “I guess that is the question.” She looked up at him, squinting through the bright, clear sun. “So…Hale Industries? You really think it’s over?”\n Hale looked ahead, as if the jet wasn’t right in front of them, gleaming like a mirage.\n “Without the prototype, yeah. I guess we can sell off all the pieces, but the company won’t go on. Funny. I didn’t think I’d miss it,” he said.\n “But…”\n “I think I might miss the possibility of it.”\n “I’m your Colgan.” Kat didn’t know she’d said the words aloud until Hale spun on her, took her small shoulders in his hand.\n “What’s that supposed to mean?”\n “I’m the thing you ran to when you wanted to try another life. I’m your big experiment. But in the end…maybe you were always meant to go back home.”\n “Don’t say that. This isn’t some experiment I’m doing. I’m not running away.”\n “Yes, Hale. You are. And that’s okay. It is,” she said when he gave her a look. “I just need you to know that if you ever want to go back home, you can. I did all this to make sure you always had a home to go back to.”\n “What are you talking about, Kat?”\n “I had to do everything, Hale. I had to try everything, so that’s why I…” Kat trailed off, but she looked at Gabrielle, who whistled.\n The door of the jet slid down, but Kat couldn’t take her eyes off of Hale. She studied the silent, subtle changes in his expression as the woman from the train walked down the stairs and across the tarmac.\n “Hale,” Kat said, “I don’t think you’ve ever met Gabrielle’s mom. Aunt Irina, this is Hale.”\n He stared, dumbfounded, at the woman who was opening her arms. Gabrielle ran into them.\n “Mama,” Gabrielle said, and the pair spoke in rapid French.\n Finally, the woman pulled away from Gabrielle and looked Hale up and down, examining him before scolding her daughter. “Oh, Gabrielle, why did you let Kat call dibs on this one?”\n “She saw him first,” Gabrielle said with a smile.\n “You…” Hale muttered. “You bought the prototype?”\n “Well, technically, she conned your prototype. If Garrett hadn’t been detained, he would have found that the money that was supposed to be in his account wasn’t exactly…there,” Gabrielle told him. “Funny thing about wireless networks. They can be incredibly insecure.”\n “Plus, Simon is on our side,” Kat said.\n “Yes,” Irina said. “He is. Now, I believe you’ve been looking for this.” Gabrielle’s mom handed Hale a case and slid on her dark glasses. “And now it’s yours. If you want it.”\n “So”—Kat eyed him—“do you want it?”\n Chapter 47\n The board of directors of Hale Industries usually only met on the first of every month, but that day—like so many days of late—was an exception. The owner was still a minor, and the minor’s trustee was sitting in a German prison, awaiting extradition to the United States, so no one was surprised when the board was summoned and the new owner and his family descended on the building that bore their name.\n What no one was expecting was the sight of a short teenage girl walking into the room where the Hale family was waiting, as easily as if she owned the place.\n “Hello, Kat.” Hale’s mother smiled coolly. “It’s nice of you to come, but I’m afraid Scooter is busy. We’re about to go in and see the board—sort out this trustee business. I’m afraid he doesn’t have time for you.”\n And there it was, the scowl that Hale’s mother had first given at the wake, before her son had the shares and the money and the power. Before Senior and his wife had needed Scooter on their side.\n “Oh.” Kat’s eyes were wide. “So you’re going to be the new trustees, then?”\n “Well, of course we are. We’re his parents.”\n “Actually, Mom…” Hale said and pointed to the door, where Marianne stood, a confused look on her face.\n “Marianne,” Senior said. “I wasn’t expecting to see you here.”\n “Grandma was,” Hale said, but his eyes never left the woman’s.\n “What’s that supposed to mean?” Senior asked.\n “Well, see,” Kat told them, “Hazel always meant to give your son the company. Garrett didn’t have to change that.”\n “Then what did he change?” Hale’s mother snapped.\n “The trustee,” Kat said simply.\n Hale walked to his grandmother’s best friend and took her hands. “Will you do it?” he asked. “The position comes with a pretty significant annual salary, profit sharing, bonuses, and other perks until I turn twenty-five.”\n Marianne’s eyes were wide. “I…I don’t understand.”\n Kat shook her head. “Hazel didn’t give you a part of the company, Marianne. She gave you him.” Kat pointed to the boy beside her. “Or temporary control over his shares, at least.”\n “No one will blame you if you say no,” Hale said, blushing. “I’m not exactly returnable.”\n “I…” Marianne looked dumbfounded. “I can’t do this.”\n “Hazel did it,” Hale said. “And you were right by her side every step of the way. If anyone can run this place the way she did, it’s you.” He turned back to the door and said, “And you don’t have to do it alone.”\n He turned the knob to reveal Silas, bow tie and all.\n “Sorry I’m late.” Silas gave the little laugh that Kat had grown to love so much. “I’ve been busy in my new lab.” He chuckled and held up a small case. “I took the liberty of making a few upgrades to the original Genesis design.” He pulled out a new prototype and gave Kat a wink. “I had a most capable assistant.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-scoundrels-heist-society-3/page-33.html","bookId":2406,"book":{"id":2406,"title":"Perfect Scoundrels (Heist Society #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Perfect Scoundrels (Heist Society #3) \n Katarina Bishop and W.W.
