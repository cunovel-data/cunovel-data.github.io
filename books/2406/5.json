Never before had she regretted breaking her way into someplace she didn’t belong.\n “Did he just run off with that redhead?” Gabrielle said, sidling up to Kat and taking a big bite of shrimp. “And answer to the name of Scooter?”\n “Come on, Gabs. It’s time for us to leave.”\n The woods seemed different on the long walk back to the car, and Kat couldn’t shake the feeling that she was forgetting something. Then she stopped and looked at the house.\n Someone.\n “Hello, miss.”\n Kat couldn’t help but smile when she saw the uniformed man who stood at attention beside a long black limousine.\n “Marcus!” Kat cried. “I haven’t seen you since—”\n “I was very sorry about Buenos Aires. It was most unfortunate timing.” He looked at Gabrielle, tipped his hat. “Miss Gabrielle, it’s nice to see you. If you don’t mind, I have a favor to ask.”\n “Anything,” Gabrielle said.\n “Well, I was wondering if I could perhaps drive your cousin back to the city myself.”\n “You don’t have to do that, Marcus,” Kat said. “I know it’s probably a difficult time for you.”\n “Please,” Marcus said, reaching for the limo’s rear door. “It would be a relief to do something.”\n Kat understood. For a girl who was used to adrenaline and fear, there was no feeling in the world she hated more than being helpless, so she asked her cousin, “Gab, you mind?”\n “Oh, please.” Gabrielle rolled her eyes, then looked at Marcus. “You can have her.”\n A second later, her cousin was climbing into her car and driving away without as much as a tire mark to prove she’d been there at all. Uncle Eddie would have been incredibly proud.\n “If you will, miss…” Kat turned to see Marcus holding open the limo door. For a second, Kat considered sitting in the front, but Marcus was a man for whom tradition and decorum mattered. And so Kat slid into the backseat without another word.\n Sitting on the soft leather, Kat couldn’t help but wonder how many hours she’d spent staring at the back of the valet’s head. He was always there. Never far from Hale’s side. And then Kat knew what had been missing from the big house.\n “I didn’t see you inside, Marcus.”\n “Yes. I wasn’t able to attend, but I was hoping to see you.”\n “You were?”\n “Yes,” he said, but didn’t offer anything more.\n “Did you know Hale’s grandmother well?”\n “I did. She was a great, great woman.”\n “Was Hale close to her?”\n Marcus nodded. “He was.”\n “I didn’t know.” Kat stared out the window. “He never mentioned her to me. Why doesn’t he talk about her?”\n “The things that are the most precious to us are sometimes the most secret.”\n Kat nodded and considered the thought. Her family was loud and cranky, a force of nature, moving around the globe like a storm. Hale’s family was quiet and fractured, their issues simmering under the surface like a sleeping volcano.\n “Marcus,” she said, bolting upright when the car steered off the main road and onto a narrow path. “Marcus, I don’t think this goes to the highway.”\n “No, miss. It doesn’t.”\n Marcus wasn’t forgetful. He wasn’t the sort of man to make mistakes, and so whatever had brought them to that narrow, winding lane, Kat knew it was absolutely not an error.\n “We’re not going to Brooklyn, are we, Marcus?”\n “No, miss.” He gripped the wheel and kept on driving. “We aren’t.”\n They didn’t go far. By Kat’s estimation they weren’t more than a half a mile from the main road when the car stopped. She could still see the smoke rising from the chimney of the big house hidden behind the trees, and yet it felt a world away from the tiny cottage with the white picket fence and perfectly pruned roses that stood before her. There were black shutters and flower boxes on every window. An ornate railing ran along a cozy porch, and the whole place looked almost like it had been made from gingerbread.\n “Marcus, where are we? Who lives here?”\n He turned off the car and reached for the door. “I do.”\n Chapter 6\n “I never knew you had a house.”\n Kat crawled from the backseat of the car and looked up at the man who held her door. Maybe it was her imagination, but she could have sworn he didn’t stand quite as straight, there in his own driveway. He looked at her a little more squarely. He wasn’t a servant then, she realized. He was a man, welcoming her into his home.\n “Oh, it’s not entirely mine. I share it with—”\n “Marcus? Marcus, is that…”\n A woman was standing in the doorway, a dish towel in her hands. She had steel gray hair and the same piercing eyes that Kat had seen reflected in the rearview mirror for years.\n “Miss Katarina Bishop,” Marcus said, “please allow me to introduce my sister, Marianne.”\n “You’re Marianne?” Kat thought about the way Hale’s mother had said the name, almost with a snarl. “It’s nice to meet you.” Kat extended her hand. But Marianne just gaped at Marcus.\n “Oh, brother. What have you done?”\n Somewhere in the house a kettle screamed. It made a sharp, haunting sound. The woman turned, Marcus at her heels, and Kat followed them into a tiny kitchen with white lace curtains and a tray set out for tea.\n “I’m very sorry, Miss Bishop,” the woman said, her British accent even stronger than her brother’s. “I mean no disrespect. I’m sure you’re a very talented young lady. But this is a private family matter.”\n “You were her family!” It was the first time Kat had ever heard Marcus raise his voice, and she had to do a double-take to make sure it was him and not some well-groomed imposter.\n “You forget yourself, brother. And your place. If our father were alive—”\n “He isn’t.”\n “Marcus,” Marianne said grimly, “this is not our way.”\n Marcus pointed at Kat. “It’s her way.”\n The kettle still screamed, so Marianne pulled it from the flame, but the silence that followed was too loud, and Kat had no choice but to say, “Uh…which way is that?”\n “I’ve observed many things in the past few years, miss.” Marcus looked her in the eye. “It is not my place to talk, but I do see. I see everything. And after what I’ve seen, I know that you may be the only person who can help. And so, miss, I would like to hire you. For a job.”\n Kat could have sworn she’d misunderstood. “A job job?”\n “Yes. There is something that I would like for you to steal.”\n Marianne brought a handkerchief to her mouth but didn’t protest.\n “Okay, Marcus.” Kat took a seat at the table. “I think you’d probably better start at the beginning.”\n Never before had Kat thought about whether or not Marcus had a family. She hadn’t wondered where he went when he wasn’t at Hale’s beck and call. But there she was in his kitchen, sitting across from his sister, listening as he said, “Our parents were in service to the late Mr. Hale the Second. Marianne and I were born into this proud tradition, and when our time came, we were honored to follow in our parents’ footsteps.”\n “The family business,” Kat added, half under her breath.\n Marcus nodded. “Exactly. Our family has worked for the Hales for four generations.”\n He sat up a little straighter when he said it, and Kat knew that, in his world, that was a thing of great esteem.\n “When she was very young, Marianne was asked to care for the new wife of Mr. Hale the Third—a young American woman who had come from…shall we say…humble beginnings. But who was also very, very kind.”\n “Hazel,” Kat filled in.\n Marcus nodded.\n “When the new Mrs. Hale came to us…well…I imagine our world must have seemed incredibly strange to her. The ladies still dressed for dinner in those days. Her new husband played polo with a cousin of the king. And there she was, half a world away from anything she’d ever known, with nothing but a husband who was constantly working.”\n Marcus took a deep breath. “Well, that’s not exactly true. She had a husband”—he cut his eyes at his sister—“and a maid.”\n Soon Marianne was reaching for her handkerchief again and dabbing at tears.\n “My sister wasn’t much younger than Mrs. Hale. There they were, both living apart from their families for the first time. And so Marianne wasn’t just a ladies’ maid. She was also Mrs. Hale’s only friend.”\n “She was so alone.” Marianne’s voice cracked. “So, so alone in that big house. She had everything. But she had no one.”\n “My sister worked for Mrs. Hale for sixty years,” Marcus said.\n “Sixty-four,” Marianne corrected. “I was in service to a fine woman for sixty-four years.” She righted herself, standing. “And I know what you think, brother, but I will not sit here and hear her good name slandered.”\n “So then don’t sit. Don’t listen,” Marcus said. “But that won’t change what happened.”\n “What did happen, Marcus?” Kat asked.\n “Mrs. Hale always told my sister that she would provide for her—that she would never have to worry about caring for herself because Marianne would be included in her will.”\n “Aren’t they reading the will right now?” Kat asked.\n Marcus gave a solemn nod. “Exactly. Yesterday, we received word that there would be no reason for Marianne to attend the reading—that only those who were mentioned in the will were invited.”\n “Don’t be silly, Marcus,” Marianne said, summoning her pride. “Who was I to think I’d be included? I’m a ladies’ maid. No more. No less.”\n “Hazel was your best friend, Marianne, and if—”\n “It was Mrs. Hale’s fortune,” the maid said, special emphasis on the words as if her brother had grown too comfortable and needed to be reminded of his place. “And Mrs. Hale could do with it what she wanted.”\n “This is what she wanted?” Marcus snapped. “For her oldest friend to be left with nothing? I don’t believe it. I do not.”\n “Marcus,” Kat said, her voice low. “Marcus, are you saying…”\n “These aren’t Mrs. Hale’s wishes, I’m sure of it. Her family is gathered at the big house today to hear a will, miss. But I do not believe that it is her will.”\n “So you think there’s…what? Another will out there someplace?”\n “I do.” Marcus nodded. “And I’d like to hire you to find it.”\n Chapter 7 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-scoundrels-heist-society-3/page-5.html","bookId":2406,"book":{"id":2406,"title":"Perfect Scoundrels (Heist Society #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Perfect Scoundrels (Heist Society #3) \n Katarina Bishop and W.W.
