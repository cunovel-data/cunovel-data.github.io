At breakfast that morning (a simple meal of marmalade spread lightly over a honeycomb or two) he had suddenly thought of a new song. It began like this:\\n\\n \"Sing Ho! For the life of a Bear.\"\\n\\n When he had got as far as this, he scratched his head, and thought to himself \"That\u0027s a very good start for a song, but what about the second line?\" He tried singing \"Ho,\" two or three times, but it didn\u0027t seem to help. \"Perhaps it would be better,\" he thought, \"if I sang Hi for the life of a Bear.\" So he sang it . . . but it wasn\u0027t. \"Very well, then,\" he said, \"I shall sing that first line twice, and perhaps if I sing it very quickly, I shall find myself singing the third and fourth lines before I have time to think of them, and that will be a Good Song. Now then:\"\\n\\n Then they all went home again. And I think, but I am not quite sure, that Roo had a hot bath and went straight to bed. But Pooh went back to his own house, and feeling very proud of what he had done, had a little something to revive himself.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/364/347.html","bookId":694,"book":{"id":694,"title":"维尼熊的故事 Winnie the Pooh","description":"简介： 维尼是一头可爱的小熊，维尼最在乎他的朋友以及朋友们的幸福和感受，再没有比小熊维尼更好的朋友了。 维尼永远也吃不够蜂蜜，喜欢把手边的所有小东西放到嘴里咂吮，以安慰它那...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110829/1-110R9142330508.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/364","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:11 AM"}}
