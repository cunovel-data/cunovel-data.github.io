Her hair’s all poofy and she’s got a great nose. I mean, a great nose. And, what? What do you people like? Boobs? She seems to have boobs. They seem to be of approximately normal boob size. What else do you want?”\\n\\n “I don’t want to talk about this.”\\n\\n He starts the car and then begins banging his tetherball of a head against the car’s horn rhythmically. Ahnnnk. Ahhhnk. Ahhhnk.\\n\\n “You’re embarrassing us,” I shout over the horn.\\n\\n “I’m going to keep doing this until I get a concussion or you say you’ll call her.”\\n\\n I jam my fingers into my ears, but Tiny keeps headbutting the horn. People are looking at us. Finally I just say, “Fine. Fine! FINE!” And the honking ceases.\\n\\n “I’ll call Jane. I’ll be nice to her. But I still don’t want to date her.”\\n\\n “That is your choice. Your stupid choice.”\\n\\n “So then,” I say hopefully, “no production of Tiny Dancer?”\\n\\n Tiny starts the car. “Sorry, Grayson, but I can’t do it. Tiny Dancer is bigger than you or me, or any of us.”\\n\\n “Tiny, you have a really warped understanding of compromise.”\\n\\n He laughs. “Compromise is when you do what I tell you and I do what I want. Which reminds me: I’m gonna need you to be in the play.”\\n\\n I stifle a laugh, because this shit won’t be funny anymore if it’s staged in our goddamned auditorium. “Absolutely not. No. NO. Also, I insist that you write me out of it.”\\n\\n Tiny sighs. “You just don’t get it, do you? Gil Wrayson isn’t you; he’s a fictional character. I can’t just change my art because you’re uncomfortable with it.”\\n\\n I try a different tack. “You’re gonna humiliate yourself up there, Tiny.”\\n\\n “It’s going to happen, Grayson. I’ve got the support on the student council for the money. So shut up and deal with it.”\\n\\n I shut up and deal with it, but I don’t call Jane that night. I’m not Tiny’s errand boy.\\n\\n The next afternoon I take the bus home, because Tiny is busy at the student council meeting. He calls me as soon as it’s over.\\n\\n “Great news, Grayson!” he shouts.\\n\\n “Great news for someone is always bad news for someone else,” I answer.\\n\\n And sure enough, the student council has approved a thousand dollars for the staging and production of the musical Tiny Dancer.\\n\\n That night I’m waiting for my parents to come home so we can eat, and I’m trying to work on this essay about Emily Dickinson, but mostly I’m just downloading everything the Maybe Dead Cats have ever recorded. I kind of absolutely love them. And as I keep listening to them, I keep wanting to tell someone how good they are, and so I call Tiny, but he doesn’t pick up, and so I do exactly what Tiny wants—just like always. I call Jane.\\n\\n “Hey, Will,” she says.\\n\\n “I kind of absolutely love the Maybe Dead Cats,” I say.\\n\\n “They’re not bad, yeah. A bit pseudointellectual but, hey, aren’t we all?”\\n\\n “I think their band name is a reference to, like, this physicist guy,” I say. In fact, I know it. I’ve just looked the band up on Wikipedia.\\n\\n “Yeah,” she says. “Schrödinger. Except the band name is a total fail, because Schrödinger is famous for pointing out this paradox in quantum physics where, like, under certain circumstances, an unseen cat can be both alive and dead. Not maybe dead.”\\n\\n “Oh,” I say, because I can’t even pretend to have known that. I feel like a total dumbass, so I change the subject. “So I hear Tiny Cooper worked his Tiny Magic and the musical’s on.”\\n\\n “Yeah. What’s your problem with Tiny Dancer, anyway?”\\n\\n “Have you ever read it?”\\n\\n “Yeah. It’s amazing, if he can pull it off.”\\n\\n “Well, I’m, like, the costar. Gil Wrayson. That’s me, obviously. And it’s just, it’s embarrassing.”\\n\\n “Don’t you think it’s kind of awesome to be, like, the costar of Tiny’s life?”\\n\\n “I don’t really want to be the costar of anyone’s life,” I say. She doesn’t say anything in response. “So how are you?” I ask after a second.\\n\\n “I’m okay.”\\n\\n “Just okay?”\\n\\n “Did you get the note in your coat pocket?”\\n\\n “The what—no. There was a note?”\\n\\n “Yeah.”\\n\\n “Oh. Hold on.” I put the phone down on the desk and ransack my pockets. The thing about my coat pockets is that if I have a small amount of trash—like, say, a Snickers wrapper—but I don’t see a garbage can, my pockets end up becoming the garbage can. And I’m not great when it comes to taking out the pocket trash. So it takes me a few minutes before I find a folded piece of notebook paper. On the outside it says:\\n\\n To: Will Grayson\\n\\n From: The Locker Houdini\\n\\n I grab the phone and say, “Hey, I found it.” I feel a little sick to my stomach, in a way that is both nice and not.\\n\\n “Well, did you read it?”\\n\\n “No,” I say, and I wonder if maybe the note is not better left unread. I shouldn’t have called her in the first place. “Hold on.” I unfold the paper:\\n\\n Mr. Grayson,\\n\\n You should always make sure no one’s watching when you unlock your locker. You never know (18) when someone (26) will memorize (4) your combination. Thanks for the coat. I guess chivalry isn’t dead.\\n\\n yours,\\n\\n Jane\\n\\n p.s. I like how you treat your pockets the way I treat my car.\\n\\n Upon finishing the note, I read it again. It makes both truths more true. I want her. I don’t. Maybe I am a robot after all. I have no idea what to say, so I go ahead and say the worst possible thing. “Very cute.” This is why I should adhere to Rule 2.\\n\\n In the ensuing silence, I have time to contemplate the word cute—how dismissive it is, how it’s the equivalent of calling someone little, how it makes a person into a baby, how the word is a neon sign burning through the dark reading, “Feel Bad About Yourself.”\\n\\n And then finally she says, “Not my favorite adjective.”\\n\\n “Sorry. I mean, it’s—”\\n\\n “I know what you mean, Will,” she says. “I’m sorry. I, uh, I don’t know. I just got out of a relationship, and I think I’m, like, kind of just looking to fill that hole, and you’re the most obvious candidate to fill the hole, and oh my God that sounds dirty. Oh, God. I’m just gonna hang up.”\\n\\n “I’m sorry about cute. It wasn’t cute. It was—”\\n\\n “Forget it. Forget the note, really. I don’t even . . . Just don’t worry about it, Grayson.”\\n\\n After an awkward hanging up, I realize the intended ending of the “I don’t even . . .” sentence. “I don’t even . . . like you, Grayson, because you’re kind of how can I say this politely not that smart. Like, you had to look up that physicist on Wikipedia. I just miss my boyfriend, and you wouldn’t kiss me, so I kind of want to just because you wouldn’t, and it’s really actually not a big deal but I can’t find a way to tell you that without hurting your feelings, and since I’m far more compassionate and thoughtful than you with your cutes, I’m just going to stop the sentence at I don’t even.”\\n\\n I call Tiny again, this time not about the Maybe Dead Cats, and he picks up on the first half-ring and says, “Good evening, Grayson.”\\n\\n I ask him if he agrees with me about what the end of her sentence probably was, and then I ask him what shortcircuited in my brain to call the note cute, and how is it even possible to be both attracted and not attracted to someone at the very same moment, and whether maybe I am a robot incapable of real feelings, and do you think that actually, like, trying to follow the rules about shutting up and not caring has made me into some kind of hideous monster whom no one will ever love or marry. I say it all, and Tiny says nothing, which is a basically unprecedented turn of events, and then when I finally stop, Tiny says hrmm in the little way that he has and then he says—and I am quoting him directly here—“Grayson, sometimes you are such. a. girl.” And then he hangs up on me.\\n\\n The unfinished sentence stays with me all night. And then my robot heart decides to do something—the kind of something that would be enjoyed by a hypothetical girl-I-would-like.\\n\\n At school on Friday, I eat lunch superfast, which is easy enough to do because Tiny and I are sitting with a table full of Drama People, and they are discussing Tiny Dancer, all of them speaking more words per minute than I speak in a day. The conversational curve follows a distinct pattern—the voices get louder and faster, crescendoing until Tiny, talking over everyone, makes a joke, and the table explodes in laughter and then things calm briefly, and then the voices start again, building and building into the coming Tiny eruption. Once I notice this pattern, it becomes difficult not to pay attention to it, but I try to focus on wolfing down my enchiladas. I chug a Coke and then stand up.\\n\\n Tiny holds up his hand to quiet the chorus. “Where ya going, Grayson?”\\n\\n “I gotta go check on something,” I say.\\n\\n I know the approximate location of her locker. It is approximately across from the hallway mural in which a poorly painted version of our school mascot, Willie the Wildkit, says in a speech bubble, “Wildkits Respect EVERYONE,” which is hilarious on at least fourteen different levels, the fourteenth being that there is no such thing as a wildkit. Willie the Wildkit looks approximately like a mountain lion, though, and while I am admittedly not an expert in zoology, I’m reasonably sure that mountain lions do not, in fact, respect everyone.\\n\\n So I’m leaning against the Willie the Wildkit mural in such a way that it appears that I’m the one saying that Wildkits Respect EVERYONE, and I have to wait like that for about ten minutes, just trying to look like I’m doing something and wishing I’d brought a book or whatever so I wouldn’t look so aggressively stalkerish, and then finally the period bell rings and the hallway floods with people.\\n\\n Jane gets to her locker, and I step into the middle of the hallway, and people make way for me, and I take a step to the left to get the angle just right, and I can see her hand reach up to the lock, and I squint, and 25-2-11. I turn into the flow of people and walk to history.\\n\\n Seventh period, I take this video game-design class. It turns out that designing video games is incredibly hard and not nearly as fun as playing them, but the one advantage of the class is that I have Internet access and my monitor faces away from the teacher most of the time.\\n\\n So I e-mail the Maybe Dead Cats.\\n\\n From:\\n\\n [email protected]\\n\\n To:\\n\\n [email protected]\\n\\n Subject: Make My Life\\n\\n Dear Maybe Dead Cats,\\n\\n If you happen to play “Annus Miribalis” tonight, could you possibly dedicate it to 25-2-11 (a certain girl’s locker combination)? That would be amazing. Sorry about the short notice,\\n\\n Will Grayson\\n\\n The reply comes before the period is even over.\\n\\n Will,\\n\\n Anything for love.\\n\\n MDC\\n\\n So after school on Friday, Jane and Tiny and I go to Frank ’s Franks, a hot-dog restaurant a few blocks away from the club. I sit in a small booth next to Jane, her hip against my hip. Our coats are all bunched up across from us along with Tiny. Her hair is falling in all these big curls on her shoulders, and she’s wearing this non weather-appropriate top with thin straps and quite a lot of eye makeup.\\n\\n Because this is a classy hot-dog joint, a waiter takes our order. Jane and I each want one hot dog and a soda. Tiny orders four hot dogs with buns, three hot dogs without buns, a bowl of chili, and a Diet Coke.\\n\\n “A Diet Coke?” asks the waiter. “You want four hot dogs with buns, three hot dogs without buns, a bowl of chili, and a Diet Coke?”\\n\\n “That’s correct,” says Tiny, and then explains, “simple sugars don’t really help me put on muscle mass.” And the waiter just shakes his head and says, “Uh-huh.”\\n\\n “Your poor digestive system,” I say. “One day your intestinal tract is going to revolt. It’s going to reach up and strangle you.”\\n\\n “You know Coach says ideally I should put on thirty pounds for the start of next season. If I want to get scholarships from Division I schools? You gotta be big. And it’s just so hard for me to put on weight. I try and I try, but it’s a constant battle.”\\n\\n “You’ve got a real hard life, Tiny,” says Jane. I laugh, and we exchange glances, and then Tiny says, “Oh my God, just do it already,” which leads to an uncomfortable silence that lasts until Jane asks, “So where are Gary and Nick?”\\n\\n “Probably getting back together,” Tiny says. “I broke up with Nick last night.”\\n\\n “That was the right thing to do. It was doomed from the start.”\\n\\n “I know, right? I really think I want to be single for a while.”\\n\\n I turn to Jane and say, “I bet you five bucks he’ll be in love within four hours.”\\n\\n She laughs. “Make it three and you’re on.”\\n\\n “Deal.”\\n\\n We shake.\\n\\n After dinner, we walk around the neighborhood for a little while to kill time and then get in line outside the Storage Room. It’s cold out, but up against the building, we’re out of the wind at least. In line, I pull out my wallet, move the fake ID to the front picture window, and hide my real driver’s license between a health insurance card and my dad’s business card.\\n\\n “Let me see it,” says Tiny, and I hand him my wallet, and he says, “Damn, Grayson, for once in your life you don’t look like a bitchsquealer in a picture.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/will-grayson-will-grayson/page-9.html","bookId":2712,"book":{"id":2712,"title":"Will Grayson, Will Grayson","description":"Storyline: Will Grayson, Will Grayson by John Green , David Levithan \\n One cold night, in a most unlikely corner of Chicago, two teens—both named Will Grayson—are about to cross paths.
