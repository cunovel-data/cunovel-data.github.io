{"id":44124,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. RISEN.","content":"I t was not until the pit was cleared of water and about to go to work again, that the question of Bill Haden and his wife removing from their cottage came forward for decision. Jack had been staying with Mr. Brook, who had ordered that the house in which the late manager had lived should be put in good order and furnished from top to bottom, and had arranged for his widow and children to remove at once to friends living at a distance. Feeling as he did that he owed his life to the young man, he was eager to do everything in his power to promote his comfort and prosperity, and as he was, apart from the colliery, a wealthy man and a bachelor, he did not care to what expense he went. The house, \"the great house on the hill,\" as Jack had described it when speaking to his artist friend Pastor years before, was a far larger and more important building than the houses of managers of mines in general. It had, indeed, been originally the residence of a family owning a good deal of land in the neigh[Pg 290]bourhood, but they, when coal was discovered and work began, sold this property and went to live in London, and as none cared to take a house so close to the coal-pits and village of Stokebridge, it was sold for a nominal sum to the owner of the Vaughan, and was by him used as a residence for his manager. Now, with the garden nicely laid out, redecorated and repaired outside and in, and handsomely furnished, it resumed its former appearance of a gentleman\u0027s country seat. Mr. Brook begged Jack as a favour not to go near the house until the place was put in order, and although the young man heard that a Birmingham contractor had taken it in hand, and that a large number of men were at work there, he had no idea of the extensive changes which were taking place. A few days before work began again at the Vaughan Jack went down as usual to the Hadens\u0027, for he had looked in every day to say a few words to them on his way back from the pit-mouth. \"Now, dad,\" he said, \"we must not put the matter off any longer. I am to go into the manager\u0027s house in a fortnight\u0027s time. I hear they have been painting and cleaning it up, and Mr. Brook tells me he has put new furniture in, and that I shall only have to go in and hang up my hat. Now I want for you to arrange to come up on the same day.\" \"We ha\u0027 been talking the matter over in every mortal way, the old woman and me, Jack, and I\u0027ll tell \u0027ee what we\u0027ve aboot concluded. On one side thou really wan\u0027t t\u0027 have us oop wi\u0027 \u0027ee.\" [Pg 291] \"Yes, indeed, dad,\" Jack said earnestly. \"I know thou dost, lad; me and Jane both feels that. Well that\u0027s an argiment that way. Then there\u0027s the argiment that naturally thou would\u0027st not like the man who hast brought thee oop to be working in the pit o\u0027 which thou wast manager. That\u0027s two reasons that way; on the other side there be two, and the old \u0027ooman and me think they are stronger than t\u0027others. First, we should be out o\u0027 place at the house oop there. Thou wilt be getting to know all kinds o\u0027 people, and whatever thou may\u0027st say, Jack, your mother and me would be oot o\u0027 place. That\u0027s one argiment. The next argiment is that we shouldn\u0027t like it, Jack, we should feel we were out o\u0027 place and that our ways were out o\u0027 place; and we should be joost miserable. Instead o\u0027 doing us a kindness you\u0027d joost make our lives a burden, and I know \u0027ee don\u0027t want to do that. We\u0027s getting on in loife and be too old to change our ways, and nothing thou could\u0027st say could persuade us to live a\u0027ways dressed up in our Sunday clothes in your house.\" \"Well, dad, I might put you both in a comfortable cottage, without work to do.\" \"What should I do wi\u0027out my work, Jack? noa, lad, I must work as long as I can, or I should die o\u0027 pure idleness. But I needn\u0027t work at a stall. I\u0027m fifty now, and although I ha\u0027 got another fifteen years\u0027 work in me, I hope, my bones bean\u0027t as liss as they was. Thou might give me the job as underground viewer. I can put in a prop or see to the firing o\u0027 a shot wi\u0027 any [Pg 292]man. Oi\u0027ve told my mates you want to have me and the old woman oop at th\u0027 house, and they\u0027ll know that if I stop underground it be o\u0027 my own choice. I know, lad, it wouldn\u0027t be roight for me to be a getting droonk at the \"Chequers\" and thou manager; but I ha\u0027 told t\u0027 old \u0027ooman that I will swear off liquor altogether.\" \"No, no, dad!\" Jack said, affected at this proof of Bill Haden\u0027s desire to do what he could towards maintaining his dignity. \"I wouldn\u0027t think o\u0027t. If you and mother feel that you\u0027d be more happy and comfortable here—and maybe you are right, I didn\u0027t think over the matter from thy side as well as my own, as I ought to have done—of course you shall stay here; and, of course, you shall have a berth as under-viewer. As for swearing off drink altogether, I wouldn\u0027t ask it of you, though I do wish you could resolve never to drink too much again. You ha\u0027 been used to go to the \"Chequers\" every night for nigh forty years, and you couldn\u0027t give it up now. You would pine away without somewhere to go to. However, this must be understood, whenever you like to come up to me I shall be glad to see you, and I shall expect you on Sundays to dinner if on no other day; and whenever the time shall come when you feel, dad, that you\u0027d rather give up work, there will be a cottage for you and mother somewhere handy to me, and enough to live comfortably and free from care.\" \"That\u0027s a bargain, lad, and I\u0027m roight glad it be off [Pg 293]my mind, for I ha\u0027 been bothering over\u0027t ever since thee spoke to me last.\" The same evening Jack had a long talk with Harry. His friend, although healthy, was by no means physically strong, and found the work of a miner almost beyond him. He had never taken to the life as Jack had done, and his friend knew that for the last year or two he had been turning his thoughts in other directions, and that of all things he would like to be a schoolmaster. He had for years read and studied a good deal, and Mr. Dodgson said that with a year in a training college he would be able to pass. He had often talked the matter over with Jack, and the latter told him now that he had entered his name in St. Mark\u0027s College, Chelsea, had paid his fees six months in advance, his savings amply sufficing for this without drawing upon his salary, and that he was to present himself there in a week\u0027s time. The announcement took away Harry\u0027s breath, but as soon as he recovered himself he accepted Jack\u0027s offer as frankly as it was made. It had always been natural for Jack to lend him a hand, and it seemed to him, as to Jack, natural that it should be so now. \"Have you told Nelly?\" \"No, I left it for you to tell, Harry. I know, of course, one reason why you want to be a schoolmaster, and she will know it too. She is a strange girl, is Nelly; I never did quite understand her, and I never shall; why on earth she should refuse you I can\u0027t make [Pg 294]out. She\u0027s had lots o\u0027 other offers these last four years, but it\u0027s all the same. There\u0027s no one she cares for, why shouldn\u0027t she take you?\" \"I can wait,\" Harry said quietly, \"there\u0027s plenty of time; perhaps some day I shall win her, and I think—yes, I think now—that I shall.\" \"Well,\" Jack said cheerfully, \"as you say there\u0027s plenty of time; I\u0027ve always said thirty was the right age to marry, and you want eight years of that, and Nelly won\u0027t get old faster than you do, so if she don\u0027t fall in love with any one else it must come right; she has stood out for nearly four years, and though I don\u0027t pretend to know anything of women, I should think no woman could go on saying no for twelve years.\" Harry, although not given to loud mirth, laughed heartily at Jack\u0027s views over love-making, and the two then walked across to Nelly Hardy\u0027s cottage. Jack told her what Bill Haden and his wife had decided, and she approved their determination. Then Harry said what Jack had arranged for him. Nelly shook her head as if in answer to her own thoughts while Harry was speaking, but when he ceased she congratulated him warmly. \"You were never fit for pit-work, Harry, and a schoolmaster\u0027s life will suit you well. It is curious that Jack\u0027s two friends should both have taken to the same life.\" Jack\u0027s surprise was unbounded when, a month after the reopening of the Vaughan, Mr. Brook took him [Pg 295]over to his new abode. His bewilderment at the size and completeness of the house and its fittings was even greater than his pleasure. \"But what am I to do alone in this great place, Mr. Brook?\" he asked; \"I shall be lost here. I am indeed deeply grateful to you, but it is much too big for me altogether.\" \"It is no bigger now than it has always been,\" Mr. Brook said, \"and you will never be lost as long as you have your study there,\" and he pointed to a room snugly fitted up as a library and study. \"You will be no more lonely than I or other men without wives and families; besides you know these may come some day.\" \"Ah! but that will be many years on,\" Jack said; \"I always made up my mind not to marry till I was thirty, because a wife prevents you making your way.\" \"Yes; but now that you have made your way so far, Jack, a wife will aid rather than hinder you. But it will be time to think of that in another three or four years. You will not find it so dull as you imagine, Jack. There is your work, which will occupy the greater part of your day. There is your study for the evening. You will speedily know all the people worth knowing round here; I have already introduced you to a good many, and they will be sure to call as soon as you are settled here. In the stable, my dear boy, you will find a couple of horses, and a saddle, and a dog-cart, so that you will be able to take exercise and call about. I shall keep the horses. I consider them neces[Pg 296]sary for my manager. My men will keep the garden in order, and I think that you will find that your salary of ￡350 a year to begin with ample for your other expenses.\" Jack was completely overpowered by the kindness of his employer, but the latter would not hear of thanks. \"Why, man, I owe you my life,\" he said; \"what are these little things in comparison?\" Jack found fewer difficulties than he had anticipated in his new position. His speech at the opening of the mine added to the favour with which he was held for his conduct at the time of the explosion, and further heightened the respect due to him for his defence of the Vaughan. As he went through the mine he had ever a cheery \"Good morning, Bob,\" \"Good morning, Jack,\" for his old comrades, and the word \"sir\" was now universally added to the answered \"Good morning,\" a concession not always made by colliers to their employers. The miners soon felt the advantages of the new manager\u0027s energy, backed as he was in every respect by the owner. The work as laid down by the government inspector was carried out, and Mr. Brook having bought up for a small sum the disused Logan mine, in which several of the lower seams of coal were still unworked, the opening between the pits was made permanent, and the Logan shaft became the upcast to the Vaughan, thus greatly simplifying the work of ventilation, lessening the danger of explosion, and giving a [Pg 297]means of escape for the miners should such a catastrophe recur in spite of all precautions. As nearly half the old workers at the pit had perished in the explosion, an equal number of new hands had to be taken on. Jack, sharing the anxiety of the vicar and Mr. Dodgson, that all the good work should not be checked by the ingress of a fresh population, directed that all vacancies should be filled up by such colliers of good character as resided at Stokebridge, working for other pits in the neighbourhood. As the Vaughan promised to be the most comfortable and well-worked pit in the country, these were only too glad to change service, and more names were given in than vacancies could be found for. As all the inhabitants of Stokebridge had participated in the benefits of the night schools and classes, and in the improvements which had taken place, the advance of the village suffered no serious check from the catastrophe at the Vaughan. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87041.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
