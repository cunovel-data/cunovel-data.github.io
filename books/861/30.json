{"id":44123,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. THE NEW MANAGER.","content":"T he next day preparations for pumping out the Vaughan commenced; but it took weeks to get rid of the water which had flowed in in five minutes. Then the work of clearing the mine and bringing up the bodies commenced. This was a sad business. A number of coffins, equal to that of the men known to be below at the time of the explosion, were in readiness in a shed near the pit mouth. These were sent down, and the bodies as they were found were placed in them to be carried above. In scarcely any instances could the dead be identified by the relatives, six weeks in the water having changed them beyond all recognition; only by the clothes could a clue be obtained. Then the funerals began. A great grave a hundred feet long by twelve wide had been dug in the churchyard, and in this the coffins were laid two deep. Some days ten, some fifteen, some twenty bodies were laid there, and at each funeral the whole village attended. Who could know whether those dearest to [Pg 284]them were not among the shapeless forms each day consigned to their last resting-place? At last the tale was complete; the last of the victims of the great explosion at the Vaughan was laid to rest, the blinds were drawn up, and save that the whole of the people seemed to be in mourning, Stokebridge assumed its usual aspect. Upon the day before the renewal of regular work, Jack Simpson, accompanied by Mr. Brook appeared upon the ground, and signified that none were to descend until he had spoken to them. He had already won their respect by his indefatigable attention to the work of clearing the mine, and by the care he had evinced for the recovery of the bodies. Few, however, of the hands had spoken to him since his accession to his new dignity; now they had time to observe him, and all wondered at the change which had been wrought in his appearance. Clothes do not make a man, but they greatly alter his appearance, and there was not one but felt that Jack looked every inch a gentleman. When he began to speak their wonder increased. Except to Mr. Dodgson, Harry, Nelly Hardy, and some of his young comrades, Jack had always spoken in the dialect of the place, and the surprise of the colliers when he spoke in perfect English without a trace of accent or dialect was great indeed. Standing up in the gig in which he had driven up with Mr. Brook he spoke in a loud, clear voice heard easily throughout the yard. [Pg 285] \"My friends,\" he said, \"my position here is a new and difficult one, so difficult that did I not feel sure that you would help me to make it as easy as possible I should shrink from undertaking it. I am a very young man. I have grown up among you, and of you, and now in a strange way, due in a great measure to the kindness of your employers, and in a small degree to my own exertions to improve myself, I have come to be put over you. Now it is only by your helping me that I can maintain this position here. You will find in me a true friend. I know your difficulties and your wants, and I will do all in my power to render your lives comfortable. Those among you who were my friends from boyhood can believe this, the rest of you will find it to be so. Any of you who are in trouble or in difficulty will, if you come to me, obtain advice and assistance. But while I will try to be your friend, and will do all in my power for your welfare, it is absolutely necessary that you should treat me with the respect due to Mr. Brook\u0027s manager. Without proper discipline proper work is impossible. A captain must be captain of his own ship though many of his men know the work as well as he does. And I am glad to be able to tell you that Mr. Brook has given me full power to make such regulations and to carry out such improvements as may be conducive to your comfort and welfare. He wants, and I want, the Vaughan to be a model mine and Stokebridge a model village, and we will do all in our power to carry out [Pg 286]our wishes. We hope that no dispute will ever again arise here on the question of wages. There was one occasion when the miners of the Vaughan were led away by strangers and paid dearly for it. We hope that such a thing will never occur again. Mr. Brook expects a fair return, and no more than a fair return, for the capital he has sunk in the mine. When times are good you will share his prosperity, when times are bad you, like he, must submit to sacrifices. If disputes arise elsewhere, they need not affect us here, for you may be sure that your wages will never be below those paid elsewhere. And now I have said my say. Let us conclude by trusting that we shall be as warm friends as ever although our relations towards each other are necessarily changed.\" Three rousing cheers greeted the conclusion of Jack\u0027s speech, after which he drove off with Mr. Brook. As the men gathered round the top of the shaft, an old miner exclaimed: \"Dang it all, I ha\u0027 it now. I was wondering all the time he was speaking where I had heard his voice before. I know now. As sure as I\u0027m a living man it was Jack Simpson as beat us back from that there engine-house when we were going to stop the pumps in the strike.\" Now that the clue was given a dozen others of those who had been present agreed with the speaker. The event was now an old one, and all bitterness had passed. Had it been known at the time, or within a few months afterwards, Jack\u0027s life would probably have [Pg 287]paid the penalty, but now the predominant feeling was one of admiration. Those who had, during the last few weeks, wearily watched the pumping out of the Vaughan, felt how fatal would have been the delay had it occurred when the strike ended and they were penniless and without resources, and no feeling of ill-will remained. \"He be a game \u0027un; to think o\u0027 that boy standing alone agin\u0027 us a\u0027, and not a soul as much as suspected it! Did\u0027st know o\u0027t, Bill Haden?\" \"Noa,\" Bill said, \"never so much as dream\u0027t o\u0027t, but now I thinks it over, it be loikely enoo\u0027. I often thought what wonderful luck it were as he gave me that \u0027ere bottle o\u0027 old Tom, and made me as drunk as a loord joost at th\u0027 roight time, and I ha\u0027 thought it were curious too, seeing as never before or since has he giv\u0027d me a bottle o\u0027 liquor, but now it all comes natural enough. Well, to be sure, and to think that lad should ha\u0027 done all that by hisself, and ne\u0027er a soul the wiser! You may be sure the gaffer didn\u0027t know no more than we, or he\u0027d a done summat for the lad at the time. He offered rewards, too, for the finding out who \u0027t were as had done it, and to think \u0027twas my Jack! Well, well, he be a good plucked un too, they didn\u0027t ca\u0027 him Bull-dog for nowt, for it would ha\u0027 gone hard wi\u0027 him had \u0027t been found out. I\u0027m main proud o\u0027 that lad.\" And so the discovery that Jack had so wished to avoid, when it was at last made, added much to the respect with which he was held in the Vaughan pit. [Pg 288]If when a boy he would dare to carry out such a scheme as this, it was clear that as a man he was not to be trifled with. The reputation which he had gained by his courage in descending into the mine, in his battle with Tom Walker, and by the clear-headedness and quickness of decision which had saved the lives of the survivors of the explosion, was immensely increased; and any who had before felt sore at the thought of so young a hand being placed above them in command of the pit, felt that in all that constitutes a man, in energy, courage, and ability, Jack Simpson was worthy the post of manager of the Vaughan mine. Bill Haden was astonished upon his return home that night to find that his wife had all along known that it was Jack who had defended the Vaughan, and was inclined to feel greatly aggrieved at having been kept in the dark. \"Did ye think as I wasn\u0027t to be trusted not to split on my own lad?\" he exclaimed indignantly. \"We knew well enough that thou mightest be trusted when thou wer\u0027t sober, Bill,\" his wife said gently; \"but as about four nights a week at that time thou wast drunk, and might ha\u0027 blabbed it out, and had known nowt in the morning o\u0027 what thou\u0027dst said, Jack and I were of a mind that less said soonest mended.\" \"May be you were right,\" Bill Haden said after a pause; \"a man has got a loose tongue when he\u0027s in drink, and I should never ha\u0027 forgiven myself had I harmed t\u0027 lad.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87040.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
