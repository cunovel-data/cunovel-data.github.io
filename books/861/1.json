{"id":44094,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. EVIL TIDINGS.","content":"A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire. The houses are dingy and colourless, and without relief of any kind. So are those in the next row, so in the street beyond, and throughout the whole village. There is a dreary monotony about the place; and if some giant could come and pick up all the rows of houses, and change their places one with another, it is a question whether the men, now away at work, would notice any difference whatever until they entered the houses standing in the place of those which they had left in the morning. There is a church, and a vicarage half hidden away in the trees in its pretty old-fashioned garden; there are two or three small red-bricked dissenting chapels, and the doctor\u0027s house, with a bright brass [Pg 10]knocker and plate on the door. There are no other buildings above the common average of mining villages; and it needs not the high chimneys, and engine-houses with winding gear, dotting the surrounding country, to notify the fact that Stokebridge is a mining village. It is a little past noon, and many of the women come to their doors and look curiously after a miner, who, in his working clothes, and black with coal-dust, walks rapidly towards his house, with his head bent down, and his thick felt hat slouched over his eyes. \"It\u0027s Bill Haden; he works at the \u0027Vaughan.\u0027\" \"What brings he up at this hour?\" \"Summat wrong, I\u0027ll be bound.\" Bill Haden stopped at the door of his house in the row first spoken of, lifted the latch, and went in. He walked along a narrow passage into the back-room. His wife, who was standing at the washing-tub, turned round with a surprised exclamation, and a bull-dog with half-a-dozen round tumbling puppies scrambled out of a basket by the fire, and rushed to greet him. \"What is it, Bill? what\u0027s brought thee home before time?\" For a moment Bill Haden did not answer, but stooped, and, as it were mechanically, lifted the dog and stroked its head. \"There\u0027s blood on thy hands, Bill. What be wrong with \u0027ee?\" \"It bain\u0027t none of mine, lass,\" the man said in an unsteady voice. \"It be Jack\u0027s. He be gone.\" [Pg 11] \"Not Jack Simpson?\" \"Ay, Jack Simpson; the mate I ha\u0027 worked with ever since we were butties together. A fall just came as we worked side by side in the stall, and it broke his neck, and he\u0027s dead.\" The woman dropped into a chair, threw her apron over her head, and cried aloud, partly at the loss of her husband\u0027s mate, partly at the thought of the narrow escape he had himself had. \"Now, lass,\" her husband said, \"there be no time to lose. It be for thee to go and break it to his wife. I ha\u0027 come straight on, a purpose. I thawt to do it, but I feel like a gal myself, and it had best be told her by another woman.\" Jane Haden took her apron from her face. \"Oh, Bill, how can I do it, and she ill, and with a two-month baby? I misdoubt me it will kill her.\" \"Thou\u0027st got to do it,\" Bill said doggedly, \"and thou\u0027d best be quick about it; it won\u0027t be many minutes afore they bring him in.\" When Bill spoke in that way his wife knew, as he said, that she\u0027d got to do it, and without a word she rose and went out, while her husband stood staring into the fire, and still patting the bull-dog in his arms. A tear falling on his hand startled him. He dropped the dog and gave it a kick, passed his sleeve across his eyes, and said angrily: \"Blest if I bain\u0027t a crying like a gal. Who\u0027d a thawt it? Well, well, poor old Jack! he was a good [Pg 12]mate too\"—and Bill Haden proceeded to light his pipe. Slowly and reluctantly Mrs. Haden passed along the row. The sad errand on which she was going was one that has often to be discharged in a large colliery village. The women who had seen Bill go in were still at their doors, and had been joined by others. The news that he had come in at this unusual hour had passed about quickly, and there was a general feeling of uneasiness among the women, all of whom had husbands or relatives below ground. When, therefore, Jane Haden came out with signs of tears on her cheeks, her neighbours on either side at once assailed her with questions. \"Jack Simpson\u0027s killed by a fall,\" she said, \"and I ha\u0027 got to break it to his wife.\" Rapidly the news spread along the row, from door to door, and from group to group. The first feeling was everywhere one of relief that it was not their turn this time; then there was a chorus of pity for the widow. \"It will go hard with her,\" was the general verdict. Then the little groups broke up, and went back to their work of getting ready for the return of their husbands from the pit at two o\u0027clock. One or two only, of those most intimate with the Simpsons, followed Jane Haden slowly down the street to the door of their house, and took up a position a short distance off, talking quietly together, in case they might be wanted, and with the intention of going in [Pg 13]after the news was broken, to help comfort the widow, and to make what preparations were needed for the last incoming of the late master of the house. It was but a minute or two that they had to pause, for the door opened again, and Jane Haden beckoned them to come in. It had, as the gossips had predicted, gone hard with the young widow. She was sitting before the fire when Jane entered, working, and rocking the cradle beside with her foot. At the sight of her visitor\u0027s pale face, and tear-stained cheeks, and quivering lips, she had dropped her work and stood up, with a terrible presentiment of evil—with that dread which is never altogether absent from the mind of a collier\u0027s wife. She did not speak, but stood with wide-open eyes staring at her visitor. \"Mary, my poor girl,\" Mrs. Haden began. That was enough, the whole truth burst upon her. \"He is killed?\" she gasped. Mrs. Haden gave no answer in words, but her face was sufficient as she made a step forward towards the slight figure which swayed unsteadily before her. Mary Simpson made no sound save a gasping sob, her hand went to her heart, and then she fell in a heap on the ground, before Mrs. Haden, prepared as she was, had time to clasp her. \"Thank God,\" Jane Haden said, as she went to the front door and beckoned the others in, \"she has fainted.\" [Pg 14] \"Ay, I thawt as much,\" one of the women said, \"and a good job too. It\u0027s always best so till he is brought home, and things are straightened up.\" Between them Mary Simpson was tenderly lifted, and carried upstairs and laid on the bed of a lodger\u0027s room there. The cradle was brought up and put beside it, and then Jane Haden took her seat by the bed, one woman went for the doctor, while the others prepared the room below. In a short time all that remained of Jack Simpson was borne home on a stretcher, on the shoulders of six of his fellow-workmen, and laid in the darkened room. The doctor came and went for the next two days, and then his visits ceased. It had gone hard with Mary Simpson. She had passed from one long fainting fit into another, until at last she lay as quiet as did Jack below; and the doctor, murmuring \"A weak heart, poor little woman; the shock was too much for her,\" took his departure for the last time from the house. Then Jane Haden, who had not left her friend\u0027s side ever since she was carried upstairs, wrapped the baby in a shawl and went home, a neighbour carrying the cradle. When Bill Haden returned from work he found the room done up, the table laid for tea, and the kettle on the fire. His wife was sitting by it with the baby on her lap. \"Well, lass,\" he said, as he entered the room, \"so the poor gal\u0027s gone. I heard it as I came along. Thou\u0027st\u0027s had a hard two days on\u0027t. Hulloa! what\u0027s that?\" [Pg 15] \"It\u0027s the baby, Bill,\" his wife said. \"What hast brought un here for?\" he asked roughly. Jane Haden did not answer directly, but standing in front of her husband, removed the handkerchief which covered the baby\u0027s face as he lay on her arm. \"Look at him, Bill; he\u0027s something like Jack, don\u0027t thou see it?\" \"Not a bit of it,\" he said gruffly. \"Kids don\u0027t take after their father, as pups do.\" \"I can see the likeness quite plain, Bill. Now,\" she went on, laying her hand on his shoulder, \"I want to keep him. We ain\u0027t got none of our own, Bill, and I can\u0027t abear the thought of his going to the House.\" Bill Haden stood irresolute. \"I shouldn\u0027t like to think of Jack\u0027s kid in the House; still he\u0027ll be a heap of trouble—worse nor a dozen pups, and no chance of winning a prize with him nohow, or of selling him, or swopping him if his points don\u0027t turn out right. Still, lass, the trouble will be thine, and by the time he\u0027s ten he\u0027ll begin to earn his grub in the pit; so if thy mind be set on\u0027t, there\u0027s \u0027n end o\u0027 the matter. Now let\u0027s have tea; I ain\u0027t had a meal fit for a dog for the last two days, and Juno ain\u0027t got her milk regular.\" So little Jack Simpson became a member of the Haden family, and his father and mother were laid to rest in the burying-ground on the hillside above the village. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87011.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
