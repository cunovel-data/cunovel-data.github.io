{"id":44115,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. A KNOTTY QUESTION.","content":"I t has not been mentioned that at the fête at Mr. Brook\u0027s on the memorable occasion of the Black Feast, Mr. Merton and his daughter were staying as guests with Mr. Brook. Mr. Merton was much struck with the extraordinary improvement which had taken place in the bearing and appearance of the young people. \"Yes,\" Mr. Dodgson, whom he congratulated upon the change, said; \"it is entirely due to the suggestion which you made upon my arrival here. The night-schools for lads and the sewing and cooking classes for the girls have done wonders, and I have found in the lad you recommended to my attention, Jack Simpson, an invaluable ally. Without him, indeed, I think that our plan would have been a failure. He is a singular young fellow, so quiet yet so determined; the influence he has over the lads of his own age is immense.\" \"He is more than singular,\" Mr. Merton said warmly; \"he is extraordinary. You only see one side of his character, I see both. As a scholar he is altogether [Pg 202]remarkable. He could carry off any open scholarship at Cambridge, and could take away the highest honours; he could pass high up among the wranglers even now, and has a broad and solid knowledge of other subjects.\" \"Indeed!\" Mr. Dodgson said, surprised; \"this is quite new to me. I know that he studies hard privately, and that he went over to see you once a month, but I had no idea that his acquirements were anything exceptional, and, indeed, although his speech is often superior to that of the other young fellows, he often makes mistakes in grammar and pronunciation.\" Mr. Merton laughed. \"That is one of his peculiarities; he does not wish to be thought above his fellows: look at his dress, now! But if you saw him with me, and heard him talking with the first men of education and science in Birmingham you would share the astonishment they often express to me, and would take him not only for a young gentleman, but for one of singular and exceptionally cultured mind.\" Jack\u0027s attire, indeed—it was after the conclusion of the cricket-match, and he had changed his clothes—was that of the ordinary pitman in his Sunday suit. A black cutaway coat, badly fitting, and made by the village tailor, a black waistcoat and trousers, with thick high-low shoes. His appearance had attracted the attention of Miss Merton, who, as he approached her, held out her hand. \"How are you, Jack? What on earth have you been doing to yourself? You look a complete guy in [Pg 203]these clothes. I was half tempted to cut you downright.\" Jack laughed. \"This is my Sunday suit, Miss Merton, it is just the same as other people\u0027s.\" \"Perhaps it is,\" the girl said, laughing, and looking round with just a little curl of her lip; \"but you know better, Jack: why should you make such a figure of yourself?\" \"I dress here like what I am,\" Jack said simply, \"a pitman. At your house I dress as one of your father\u0027s guests.\" \"I suppose you please yourself, and that you always do, Mr. Jack Simpson; you are the most obstinate, incorrigible—\" \"Ruffian,\" Jack put in laughing. \"Well, I don\u0027t know about ruffian,\" the girl said, laughing too; \"but, Jack, who is that girl watching us, the quiet-looking girl in a dark brown dress and straw bonnet?\" \"That is my friend Nelly Hardy,\" Jack said seriously. \"Yes, you have often spoken to me about her and I have wanted to see her; what a nice face she has, and handsome too, with her great dark eyes! Jack, you must introduce me to her, I should like to know her.\" \"Certainly,\" Jack said with a pleased look; and accompanied by Alice he walked across the lawn towards her. Nelly turned the instant that they moved, and [Pg 204]walking away joined some other girls. Jack, however, followed. \"Nelly,\" he said, when he reached her, \"this is Miss Merton, who wants to know you. Miss Merton, this is my friend Nelly Hardy.\" Nelly bent her head silently, but Alice held out her hand frankly. \"Jack has told me so much about you,\" she said, \"that I wanted, above all things, to see you.\" Nelly looked steadily up into her face. It was a face any one might look at with pleasure, frank, joyous, and kindly. It was an earnest face too, less marked and earnest than that now looking at her, but with lines of character and firmness. Nelly\u0027s expression softened as she gazed. \"You are very good, Miss Merton; I have often heard of you too, and wanted to see you as much as you could have done to see me.\" \"I hope you like me now you do see me,\" Miss Merton laughed; \"you won\u0027t be angry when I say that I like you, though you did turn away when you saw us coming. \"You are accustomed to meet people and be introduced,\" Nelly said quietly; \"I am not, you see.\" \"I don\u0027t think you are shy,\" Miss Merton said smiling, \"but you had a reason; perhaps some day when we know each other better you will tell me. I have been scolding Jack for making such a figure of himself. You are his friend and should not let him do it.\" [Pg 205] Jack laughed, while Nelly looked in surprise at him. \"What is the matter with him?\" she asked; \"I don\u0027t see that there is anything wrong.\" \"Not wrong,\" Miss Merton said, \"only singular to me. He has got on clothes just like all the rest, which don\u0027t fit him at all, and look as if they had been made to put on to a wooden figure in a shop window, while when we see him he is always properly dressed.\" Nelly flashed a quiet look of inquiry at Jack. \"You never told me, Jack,\" she said, with an aggrieved ring in her voice, \"that you dressed differently at Birmingham to what you do here.\" \"There was nothing to tell really,\" he said quietly. \"I told you that I had had some clothes made there, and always wore them at Mr. Merton\u0027s; but I don\u0027t know,\" and he smiled, \"that I did enter into any particulars about their cut, indeed I never thought of this myself.\" \"I don\u0027t suppose you did, Jack,\" the girl said gently, for she knew how absolutely truthful he was; \"but you ought to have told me. But see, they are getting ready to go into the tent, and I must help look after the young ones.\" \"What a fine face she has!\" Alice said; \"but I don\u0027t think she quite likes me, Jack.\" \"Not like you!\" Jack said astonished, \"what makes you think that? she was sure to like you; why, even if nobody else liked you Nelly would, because you have been so kind to me.\" [Pg 206] For the next few days the serious events of the night absorbed all thought; indeed, it was not until the following Sunday afternoon that Jack and Nelly Hardy met. Harry Shepherd, who generally accompanied them in their walks upon this day, was still suffering from the effects of the injuries he had received in the riot. Jack and his companion talked over that event until they turned to come back. Then after a pause the girl asked suddenly, \"How do you like Alice Merton, Jack?\" Jack was in no way taken by surprise, but, ignorant that the black eyes were keenly watching him, he replied: \"Oh, I like her very much, I have often told you so, Nelly.\" \"Do you like her better than me, Jack?\" Jack looked surprised this time. \"What should put such a thought in your head, lass? You know I like you and Harry better than any one in the world. We are like three brothers. It is not likely I should like Alice Merton, whom I only see once a month, better than you. She is very kind, very pleasant, very bright. She treats me as an equal and I would do anything for her, but she couldn\u0027t be the same as you are, no one can. Perhaps,\" he said, \"years on—for you know that I have always said that I should not marry till I\u0027m thirty, that\u0027s what my good friend told me more than ten years ago—I shall find some one I shall like as well as you, but that will be in a different way, [Pg 207]and you will be married years and years before that. Let me think, you are nearly seventeen, Nelly?\" The girl nodded, her face was turned the other way. \"Yes, you are above a year younger than I am. Some girls marry by seventeen; I wonder no one has been after you already, Nelly; there is no girl in the village to compare with you.\" But Nelly, without a word, darted away at full speed up the lane towards home, leaving Jack speechless with astonishment. \"She hasn\u0027t done that for years,\" he said; \"it\u0027s just the way she used to do when we were first friends. If she got in a temper about anything she would rush away and hide herself and cry for hours. What could I have said to vex her, about her marrying, or having some one courting her; there couldn\u0027t be anything in that to vex her.\" Jack thought for some time, sitting upon a stile the better to give his mind to it. Finally he gave up the problem in despair, grumbling to himself, \"One never gets to understand girls; here I\u0027ve known Nelly for the last seven years like a sister, and there she flies away crying—I am sure she was crying, because she always used to cry when she ran away—and what it is about I have not the least idea. Now I mustn\u0027t say anything about it when I meet her next, I know that of old, unless she does first, but as likely as not she will never allude to it.\" In fact no allusion ever was made to the circumstance, for before the following Sunday came round John Hardy had died. He had been sinking for months, and [Pg 208]his death had been looked for for some time. It was not a blow to his daughter, and could hardly be a great grief, for he had been a drunken, worthless man, caring nothing for his child, and frequently brutally assaulting her in his drunken fits. She had attended him patiently and assiduously for months, but no word of thanks had ever issued from his lip. His character was so well known that no one regarded his death as an event for which his daughter should be pitied. It would, however, effect a change in her circumstances. Hardy had, ever since the attack upon the Vaughan, received an allowance from the union, as well as from the sick club to which he belonged, but this would now cease; and it was conjectured by the neighbours that \"th\u0027 old ooman would have to go into the house, and Nelly would go into a factory at Birmingham or Wolverhampton, or would go into service.\" Nelly\u0027s mother was a broken woman; years of intemperance had prematurely aged her, and her enforced temperance during the last few months had apparently broken her spirit altogether, and the coarse, violent woman had almost sunk into quiet imbecility. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87032.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
