{"id":44122,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. CHANGES.","content":"B eyond the body of the crowd, outside the ring kept by the police, stood Nelly Hardy, watching, without a vestige of colour in her face, for the news from below. She had given a gasping sigh of relief as the names, passed from mouth to mouth by the crowd, met her ear, and had leaned for support against the wall behind her. So great was her faith in Jack\u0027s resources and in Jack\u0027s destiny that she had all along hoped, and the assertion that those who had first gone down to rescue the pitmen must have fallen victims to the second explosion had fallen dead upon her ears. The school had been closed from the date of the accident, and had it not been so, she felt that she could not have performed her duties. Hour after hour she had sat in her cottage alone—for her mother had died a year before—except when Mrs. Dodgson, who had long suspected her secret, came to sit awhile with her, or Harry brought the latest news. During this time she had not shed a tear, and, save for her white face and [Pg 275]hard unnatural voice, none could have told how she suffered. Harry had brought her the news of the smoke being seen from the shaft of the Logan pit before he carried it to Mrs. Haden, and she had at once thrown on her bonnet and jacket and joined them as they started from the village. When she reached the pit she had not attempted to approach, but had taken her place at a distance. Several of her pupils, with whom she was a great favourite, had come up to speak to her, but her hoarse, \"Not now, dear; please go away,\" had sufficed to send them off. But deeply agitated as she was, she was hopeful; and deep as was her joy at the news of Jack\u0027s safety she was hardly surprised. Dropping her veil to hide the tears of joy which streamed down her cheeks, she turned to go home; but she was more shaken than she had thought, and she had to grasp at the wall for support. So she waited until the last of the miners arrived at the surface, and heard the speech of the government inspector. Then when she heard Jack\u0027s elevation announced, the news shook her even more than that of his safety had done, and she fainted. When she recovered the crowd was gone, and Harry only stood beside her. He had felt that she would rather stand and watch alone, and had avoided going near her, but when Jack was driven off he had hastened to her side. He knew how she would object to her emotion becoming known, and had contented himself with lifting her veil, untying her bonnet strings, putting her in a sitting atti[Pg 276]tude against the wall, and waiting patiently till she came round. \"Are you better now?\" he inquired anxiously when she opened her eyes. \"Yes, I am well now,\" she said, glancing hastily round to see if others beside himself had noticed her situation; \"I am quite well.\" \"Don\u0027t try to get up; sit still a few minutes longer,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t try to talk.\" \"He has got his rise at last,\" she said smiling faintly and looking up; \"he has gone right away from us at a bound.\" \"I am glad,\" Harry said simply. \"He has earned it. He is a grand, a glorious fellow, is Jack. Of course I shall never be to him now what I have been, but I know that he will be as true a friend as ever, though I may not see so much of him.\" \"You are more unselfish than I, Harry; but as he was to rise, it was better that it should be at a bound far above me. Now I am better; let me go home.\" Jack Simpson\u0027s fainting fit had been but of short duration. His sturdy organization soon recovered from the shock which the fresh air and Mr. Hardinge\u0027s announcement had made upon a frame exhausted by privation, fatigue, and excitement. None the less was he astonished and indignant with himself at what he considered a girlish weakness. His thoughts were, however, speedily diverted from himself by a pitman telling him that Jane Haden was in a second faint close [Pg 277]by. Mr. Brook\u0027s carriage had been sent for in readiness, immediately the possibility of his being found alive had appeared; and that gentleman insisted upon Mrs. Haden being lifted into it, and upon Jack taking his seat beside her to support her. He then followed, and, amidst the cheers of the crowd, started for Stokebridge. Mrs. Haden recovered before reaching the village; and leaving her and Jack at their home, with an intimation that the carriage would come at an early hour next morning to fetch the latter up to the hall, Mr. Brook drove off alone. That afternoon was a proud day for Bill Haden and his wife, but a trying one for Jack. Every one in the place who had the slightest knowledge of him called to shake his hand and congratulate him on his promotion, his friends of boyhood first among them. Harry was one of the earliest comers, and tears fell down the cheeks of both as they clasped hands in silent joy at their reunion. Not a word was spoken or needed. \"Go round to Nelly,\" Jack said in an undertone as other visitors arrived; \"tell her I will come in and see her at seven o\u0027clock. Come again yourself before that, let us three meet together again.\" So quickly did the callers press in that the little room could not hold them; and Jack had to go to the front door, there to shake hands and say a word to all who wanted to see him. It was quite a levée, and it [Pg 278]was only the fact that the gloom of a terrible calamity hung over Stokebridge that prevented the demonstration being noisy as well as enthusiastic. By six o\u0027clock all his friends had seen him, and Jack sat down with Bill Haden and his wife. Then Jane Haden\u0027s feelings relieved themselves by a copious flood of tears; and Bill himself, though he reproached her for crying on such an occasion, did so in a husky voice. \"Thou art going to leave us, Jack,\" Jane Haden said; \"and though we shall miss thee sorely, thou mustn\u0027t go to think that Bill or me be sorry at the good fortune that be come upon you. Thou hast been a son, and a good son to us, and ha\u0027 never given so much as a day\u0027s trouble. I know\u0027d as how you\u0027d leave us sooner or later. There was sure to be a time when all the larning thou hast worked so hard to get would bring thee to fortune, but I didn\u0027t think \u0027twould come so soon.\" Bill Haden removed from his lips the pipe—which, in his endeavour to make up for loss of time, he had smoked without ceasing from the moment of his rescue—and grunted an acquiescence with his wife\u0027s speech. \"My dear mother and dad,\" Jack said, \"there must be no talk of parting between us. As yet, of course, it is too soon to form plans for the future; but be assured that there will be no parting. You took me when I was a helpless baby; but for you I should have been a workhouse child, and might now be coming [Pg 279]out of my apprenticeship to a tinker or a tailor. I owe all I have, all I am, to you; and whatever fortune befall me you will still be dad and mother. For a short time I must go to the hall, as Mr. Brook has invited me; and we shall have much to arrange and talk over. Afterwards I suppose I shall have to go to the manager\u0027s house, but, of course, arrangements will have to be made as to Mr. Fletcher\u0027s widow and children; and when I go there, of course you will come too.\" \"Thee\u0027st a good un, lad,\" Bill Haden said, for Mrs. Haden\u0027s tears prevented her speech; \"but I doubt what thou say\u0027st can be; but we needn\u0027t talk that over now. But t\u0027 old \u0027ooman and I be none the less glad o\u0027 thy words, Jack; though the bit and sup that thou had\u0027st here till you went into th\u0027 pit and began to pay your way ain\u0027t worth the speaking o\u0027. Thou beats me a\u0027together, Jack. When un see\u0027s a good pup un looks to his breed, and un finds it pure; but where thou get\u0027st thy points from beats me a\u0027together. Thy mother were a schoolmaster\u0027s daughter, but she had not the name o\u0027 being fond o\u0027 larning, and was a\u0027ways weak and ailing; thy dad, my mate Jack Simpson, was as true a mate as ever man had; but he were in no ways uncommon. The old \u0027ooman and I ha\u0027 reared ye; but, arter all, pups don\u0027t follow their foster-mother, for the best bull pup ain\u0027t noways injured by having a half-bred un, or for the matter o\u0027 that one wi\u0027 no breed at all, as a foster-mother; besides the old \u0027ooman and me has no points at all, \u0027cept on my part, such as are bad [Pg 280]uns; so it beats me fairly. It downright shakes un\u0027s faith in breeding.\" Here Harry\u0027s tap was heard at the door, and Jack, leaving Bill Haden to ponder over his egregious failure in proving true to blood, joined his friend outside. Scarce a word was spoken between the two young men as they walked across to Nelly Hardy\u0027s little cottage by the schoolhouse. The candles were already lighted, and Nelly rose as they entered. \"My dear Nelly.\" \"My dear Jack,\" she said, throwing her arms round his neck as a sister might have done, and kissing him, for the first time in her life; and crying, \"My dear Jack, thank God you are restored alive to us.\" \"Thank God indeed,\" Jack said reverently; \"it has been almost a miracle, Nelly, and I am indeed thankful. We prayed nearly as hard as we worked, and God was with us; otherwise assuredly we had never passed through such danger uninjured. I thought many a time of you and Harry, and what you would be doing and thinking. \"I never gave up hope, did I, Harry?\" she said; \"I thought that somehow such a useful life as yours would be spared.\" \"Many other useful lives have been lost, Nelly,\" Jack said sadly; \"but it was not my time.\" \"And now,\" Nelly said changing her tone, \"there are other things to talk of. Will you please take a chair, sir,\" and she dropped a curtsy. \"Didn\u0027t I tell [Pg 281]you, Jack,\" she said, laughing at the astonishment in Jack\u0027s face, \"that when you congratulated me on getting my post here and called me Miss Hardy, that the time would come when I should say, Sir to you. It has come, Jack, sooner than we expected, but I knew it would come.\" Then changing her tone again, as they sat looking at the fire, she went on, \"You know we are glad, Jack, Harry and I, more glad than we can say, that needs no telling between us, does it?\" \"None,\" Jack said. \"We are one, we three, and no need to say we are glad at each other\u0027s success.\" \"We have had happy days,\" Nelly said, \"but they will never be quite the same again. We shall always be friends, Jack, always—true and dear friends, but we cannot be all in all to each other. I know, dear Jack,\" she said as she saw he was about to speak vehemently, \"that you will be as much our friend in one way as ever, but you cannot be our companion. It is impossible, Jack. We have trod the same path together, but your path leaves ours here. We shall be within sound of each other\u0027s voices, we shall never lose sight of each other, but we are no longer together.\" \"I have not thought it over yet,\" Jack said quietly. \"It is all too new and too strange to me to see yet how things will work; but it is true, Nelly, and it is the one drawback to my good fortune, that there must be some little change between us. But in the friendship which began when you stood by me at the old [Pg 282]shaft and helped me to save Harry, there will be no change. I have risen as I always had determined to rise; I have worked for this from the day when Mr. Pastor, my artist friend, told me it was possible I might reach it, but I never dreamed it would come so soon; and I have always hoped and thought that I should keep you both with me. How things will turn out we do not know, but, dear friends,\" and he held out a hand to each, \"believe me, that I shall always be as I am now, and that I shall care little for my good fortune unless I can retain you both as my dearest friends.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87039.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
