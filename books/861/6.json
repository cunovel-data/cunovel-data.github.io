{"id":44099,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. SETTING TO WORK.","content":"A week after Jack Simpson had gone to work in the \"Vaughan\" there was a knock one evening at the door of the schoolmaster of the Stokebridge National School. \"Please, Mr. Merton, can I speak to \u0027ee?\" \"What, is that you, Jack Simpson!\" the schoolmaster said, holding the candle so that its light fell upon the boy before him. \"Yes, come in, my boy.\" The lad followed him into the parlour. \"Sit down, Jack. Now what is it? Nothing the matter at home, I hope?\" \"Noa, sir. I wanted to ask \u0027ee what books I orter read, so that I may grow up a clever man?\" \"Bless me, Jack,\" Mr. Merton said, \"why, I never expected this from you.\" \"Noa, sir, but I ha\u0027 made up my mind to get on, and I means to work hard. I ha\u0027 been told, sir, that if I studies at books in all my spare time, and saves my money, and works well, I may get up high some day;\" and the boy looked wistfully up in the master\u0027s face for a confirmation of what had been told him. [Pg 50] \"That\u0027s quite right, Jack, whoever told you. Hard work, study, thrift, and intelligence will take any lad from the bottom of the tree to the top. And you are quite in earnest, Jack?\" \"Quite, sir.\" The schoolmaster sat in silence for a little time. \"Well, my boy, for a bit you must work at ordinary school-books, and get a fair general knowledge, and be careful to observe the way things are expressed—the grammar, I mean; read aloud when you are alone, and try in speaking to get rid of \"thees\" and \"thous,\" and other mistakes of speech. I can lend you ordinary school-books, fit for you for the next four or five years, and will always explain any difficulties you may meet with. The books you will want afterwards you can buy second-hand at Wolverhampton or Birmingham. But there will be time to talk about that hereafter. What time have you to study? You have gone into the Vaughan pit, have you not?\" \"Yes, sir. I ha\u0027 time enough all day, for I ha\u0027 nowt to do but just to open and shut a door when the tubs come along; but I ha\u0027 no light.\" \"The time must seem very long in the dark all day.\" \"It do seem long, sir; and it will be wuss when I want to read, and know I am just wasting time. But I can read at home after work, when dad goes out. It\u0027s light now, and I could read out o\u0027 doors till nine o\u0027clock. Mother would give me a candle now and again; and I [Pg 51]should get on first rate in the pit, but the Vaughan is a fiery vein, and they ha\u0027 nowt but Daveys.\" \"Well, my boy, here are a few books, which will suit you for a time. Let me know how you are getting on; and when you have mastered the books, let me know. Remember you want to learn them thoroughly, and not just well enough to rub through without getting the strap. But don\u0027t overdo it. You are a very small boy yet, and it is of as much importance for your future life that you should grow strong in body as well as in brain. So you must not give up play. If you were to do nothing but sit in the dark, and to study at all other times, you would soon become a fool. So you must give time to play as well as to work. Remember, do not be cast down with difficulties; they will pass by if you face them. There is an old saying, \u0027God helps those who help themselves.\u0027 And look here, Jack, I can tell you the best way to make the time pass quickly while you are in the dark. Set yourself sums to do in your head. You will find it difficult at first, but it will come easier with practice, and as you get on I will give you a book on \u0027mental arithmetic,\u0027 and you will find that there is nothing more useful than being able to make complicated calculations in your head.\" The next six months passed quickly with Jack Simpson. He started early with his father for the pit, and the hours there, which at first had seemed so long, slipped by rapidly as he multiplied, and added, [Pg 52]and subtracted, finding that he could daily master longer lines of figures. Of an afternoon he played with the other pit boys, and after that worked steadily at his books till eleven o\u0027clock, two hours after Bill Haden and his wife had gone to bed. Once a week he went in the evening to Mr. Merton, who was astonished at the progress that the boy was making, and willingly devoted an hour to explaining difficulties and helping him on with his work. Satisfied now that the boy was in earnest, Mr. Merton a few days afterwards took occasion, when Mr. Brook, the owner of the Vaughan mine, called in on school business, to tell him how one of the pit boys was striving to educate himself. \"He is really in earnest, Merton; it is not a mere freak?\" \"No, Mr. Brook, the lad will stick to it, I\u0027m sure. He goes by the nickname of Bull-dog, and I don\u0027t think he is badly named; he has both the pluck and the tenacity of one.\" \"Very well, Merton; I am glad you spoke to me about it. I wish a few more boys would try and educate themselves for viewers and underground managers; it is difficult indeed to get men who are anything but working miners. I\u0027ll make a note of his name.\" A few days afterwards Mr. Brook, after going through the books, went over the mine with the underground manager. [Pg 53] \"Do the waggons often get off the metals along this road, Evans?\" he asked, stopping at one of the doors which regulate the ventilation. \"Pretty often, sir; the rails are not very true, and the sleepers want renewing.\" \"It would be as well if there were an extra light somewhere here; it would be handy. This is Number Ten door, is it not?\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Who is this? a new hand, is he not?\" raising his lamp so as to have a full look at the lad, who was standing respectfully in the niche in the rock cut for him. \"Yes, sir; he is the son of a hand who was killed in the pit some ten years ago—Simpson.\" \"Ah! I remember,\" Mr. Brooks said. \"Well, serve the boy a lamp out when he goes down of a day. You\u0027ll be careful with it, lad, and not let it fall?\" \"Oh yes, sir,\" Jack said, in a tone of delight; \"and, please, sir, may I read when I am not wanted?\" \"Certainly you may,\" his master said; \"only you must not neglect your work;\" and then Mr. Brook went on, leaving Jack so overjoyed that for that afternoon at least his attempts at mental arithmetic were egregious failures.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87016.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
