THE NIGHT-SCHOOL.","content":"J ack found that, as he expected, his friends Harry Shepherd, Bill Cummings, and Fred Wood, would be glad to attend a night-school, and to work in earnest; for the example of what Jack had done for himself, even so far as they knew, had excited a strong desire for improvement among them. They, however, were doubtful as to others, and agreed that it would not do to propose it in a straightforward manner, but that a good deal of careful management would be necessary. Jack, it was arranged, should open the subject after leading up to it carefully. Harry should be the first to consent, Bill Cummings was to give in his adhesion when he saw signs of wavering among the others, and Fred Wood to delay his until a moment when his coming forward would be useful. The following Saturday, when many of them were always together, should be the occasion, and Fred Wood was to lead up to the matter by asking Jack [Pg 135]some questions as to the relative bigness of the earth and the sun. Saturday came, the lads gathered in a field which belonged to the Vaughan, and upon which a great tip of rubbish and shale was gradually encroaching. Here choosing sides they played at rounders for a couple of hours, and then flung themselves down on the grass. Some of them lighted pipes, and all enjoyed the quiet of the fine autumn evening. Presently Fred Wood artfully fired off the questions he had prepared, which Jack answered. \"What a sight o\u0027 things thou know\u0027st, Jack!\" Bill Cummings said. \"I don\u0027t know much yet, Bill, but I hopes to know a goodish deal some day.\" \"And thou really lik\u0027st reading, Jack? I hate it,\" John Jordan said. \"I didn\u0027t like it ower much at first,\" Jack answered, \"but as I got on I liked it more and more. I wish you chaps had the chances I had. It isn\u0027t every one who would take the pains wi\u0027 a fellow as Merton took wi\u0027 me.\" \"What ud be t\u0027 good o\u0027t?\" John Jordan asked. \"I doan\u0027t see no good in knowing that t\u0027 sun be a hundred thousand times as big as t\u0027 world.\" \"There\u0027s use in a great deal o\u0027 what one gets to know, though,\" Jack said; \"not so much now as some day, maybe. A chap as has some sort o\u0027 edication has chances over another o\u0027 being chosen as a viewer or an oversman.\" [Pg 136] \"Oh! that\u0027s what thou be\u0027est looking forward to, Jack, eh? Well there\u0027s summat in that, and I shouldna\u0027 wonder if we see thee that some day; but we can\u0027t all be oversmen.\" \"Not in the Vaughan,\" Jack said; \"but there\u0027s plenty o\u0027 other pits, and a chap as has got his head screwed on straight, and can write well and figure a bit, and have read up his work, may always look forward to getting a step up wherever he goes. Besides, look at the difference it makes to the pleasures o\u0027 life. What has a man got to do who ain\u0027t learnt to be fond o\u0027 reading? Nowt but to go to t\u0027 public to spend his evenings and drink away his earnings. So \u0027ee goes on, and his woife doan\u0027t care about taking pains about a house when t\u0027 maister ain\u0027t never at home but to his meals, and his children get to look for him coming home drunk and smashing the things, and when he gets old he\u0027s just a broken-down drunkard, wi\u0027out a penny saved, and nowt but the poorhouse before him. Now, that\u0027s the sort o\u0027 life o\u0027 a man who can\u0027t read, or can\u0027t read well enough to take pleasure in it, has before him. That is so, bean\u0027t it?\" There was a long silence; all the lads knew that the picture was a true one. \"Now look at t\u0027other side,\" Jack went on; \"look at Merton. He didn\u0027t get moore pay a week than a pitman does; look how he lived, how comfortable everything was! What a home that ud be for a man to go back to after his work was done! Noice furni[Pg 137]ture, a wife looking forward neat and tidy to your coming hoam for the evening. Your food all comfortable, the kids clean and neat, and delighted to see feyther home.\" There was again a long silence. \"Where be the girls to make the tidy wife a\u0027 cooming from, I wonder?\" John Jordan said; \"not in Stokebridge, I reckon!\" \"The lasses take mostly after the lads,\" Jack said. \"If we became better they\u0027d be ashamed to lag behind. Mrs. Dodgson, the new schoolmaister\u0027s wife, told me t\u0027other day she thought o\u0027 opening a sort o\u0027 night class for big girls, to teach \u0027em sewing, and making their own clothes, and summat about cooking, and such like.\" \"That would be summat like,\" said Harry Shepherd, who saw that his opportunity had come. \"I wonder whether t\u0027 maister would open a night-school for us; I\u0027d go for one, quick enough. I doan\u0027t know as I\u0027ve rightly thought it over before, but now ye puts it in that way, Jack, there be no doubt i\u0027 my moind that I should; it would be a heap better to get some larning, and to live like a decent kind o\u0027 chap.\" \"I doan\u0027t know,\" John Jordan said; \"it moight be better, but look what a lot o\u0027 work one ud have to do.\" \"Well, John, I always finds plenty o\u0027 time for play,\" Jack said. \"You could give an hour a day to it, and now the winter\u0027s coming on you\u0027d be main glad sometimes as you\u0027d got summat to do. I should ha\u0027 [Pg 138]to talk to the schoolmaister a bit. I doan\u0027t know as he\u0027d be willing to give up his time of an evening two or three evenings a week, say two, when he\u0027s been at work all day. It be a good deal to ask a man, that is.\" \"It be, surely,\" Harry said; \"but what a sight o\u0027 good it would do, and if his woife be willing to give oop her time to the girls, maybe he would do as much for us.\" There was a pause again. Several of the lads looked irresolute. \"Well,\" Bill Cummings said, \"I be ready for another if some more of \u0027ee will join\u0027t.\" The example was contagious. Four others agreed to join. \"Come,\" Harry Shepherd said, \"it bean\u0027t no use if Jack can\u0027t tell schoolmaister that a dozen o\u0027 us will come in ef he will open a school two nights a week. You\u0027ll join, woan\u0027t you, Fred Wood?\" \"Oi allers hated my books,\" Fred said, \"and used to be bottom o\u0027 class. It ain\u0027t as I doan\u0027t believe what Jack Simpson says; there be no doubt as it would be a sight better look-out if one got to be fond o\u0027 books, and such loike. I doan\u0027t believe as ever I shall be, but I doan\u0027t mind giving it a trial for six months, and if at the end o\u0027 that time I doan\u0027t like it, why I jacks it oop.\" The adhesion of this seemingly reluctant recruit settled the matter. Even John Jordan yielded upon the same terms, and the whole party, fifteen in number, put down their names, and Jack Simpson undertook to speak to Mr Dodgson. [Pg 139] \"See how we shall get laughed at,\" John Jordan said. \"Why, we shall get made fun o\u0027 by the whole place.\" \"Let \u0027em laugh,\" Jack said, \"they won\u0027t laugh long. I never was laughed at, and why should you be? They canna call us Jennies, for we sixteen will play any sixteen wi\u0027in five miles round, at any game they like, or fight \u0027em if it comes to that. We has only got to stick together. I sha\u0027n\u0027t be one of the night-school, but I am one wi\u0027 you, and we\u0027ll just stick together. Don\u0027t let us mind if they do laugh; if they go on at it, and I doubt they will, just offer to fight anyone your own size, and if he be bigger than you like I\u0027ll take him in hand.\" \"That\u0027s it,\" Harry Shepherd said enthusiastically; \"we\u0027ll stick together, and you see how we\u0027ll get on; and look here, I vote we each pay threepence a week, that will get us a room at two bob, and candles. Then we can work a\u0027 night wi\u0027out being disturbed.\" \"This be a good idea o\u0027 thine, Harry. I\u0027ll give my threepence a week as well as the rest, and I\u0027ll come in on the nights when you don\u0027t go to school and help any that wants it.\" \"Yes,\" Bill Cummings said, \"and we\u0027ll send round challenges to the other pits to play football and rounders. I vote we call ourselves the \u0027Bull-dogs,\u0027 and Jack shall be our captain.\" The proposition was carried with unanimity, and the \"Bull-dogs\" became a body from that time. [Pg 140]Harry was appointed treasurer, and the first week\u0027s subscriptions were paid forthwith, and an hour later a room was hired. \"Hullo!\" Fred Wood said, as they poured in and took possession; \"we forgot furniture. We must have a table and some benches.\" \"It is the captain\u0027s duty to provide furniture,\" Jack said. \"I will get a big table and some benches on Monday, and then we\u0027ll draw up rules and get \u0027em framed and hung over the fireplace, then we shall be all in order.\" Nothing could have been more happy than this plan of starting a club; it gave all the members a lively interest in the matter, and united them by a bond which would keep the lazy and careless from hanging back, and it was quite with a sense of excitement that they met on the Monday evening. Jack had got a large table and some benches. Inkstands, slates, paper, and pencils were on the table, and four candles were burning. He took the place of honour at the head of the table, and the others, much pleased with the appearance of the room, took their seats round the table. \"In the first place,\" Jack said, striking the table with his fist to call for order, \"I have to report to you that I ha\u0027 seen the schoolmaister, and he says that he will willingly give two hours two nights a week to teaching the \u0027Bull-dogs.\u0027\" This announcement was received with great ap[Pg 141]plause, for the lads had all become deeply interested in the matter. \"He says Tuesdays and Fridays will suit him, from seven till nine; and I have, in your name, accepted with very many thanks his offer; for, lads, it be no light thing that a man who has been all day teaching, should give up two evenings a week to help us on, and that wi\u0027out charge or payment.\" \"That\u0027s so, Jack!\" Fred Wood said. \"I voate we pass a vote o\u0027 thanks to Mr. Dodgson.\" There was a chorus of approval. \"Someone ha\u0027 got to second that proposal,\" Jack said; \"we must do things in the proper form.\" \"I second it,\" John Jordan said. \"Very well,\" Jack said, \"are you all agreed?\" \"All.\" \"Very well, then, I\u0027ll write that out neatly in this book I ha\u0027 bought to keep the records o\u0027 the club, and I\u0027ll send a copy to Mr. Dodgson; I\u0027m sure he will be pleased. I had best act as secretary as well as captain at present, till one o\u0027 you gets on wi\u0027 his writing and can take it off my hands. Now we must draw out our rules. First, we must put down that the following are the original members of the Bull-dog Club. Then, that the objects of the club are to improve ourselves, and to make decent men o\u0027 ourselves. Next, to stick together in a body and to play all sorts o\u0027 games against any other set. All that\u0027s been agreed, ain\u0027t it?\" There were cries of \"Ay, ay,\" and Jack wrote down the items on the sheet o\u0027 paper before him. [Pg 142] \"Now about new members. Do we mean to keep it to ourselves, or to let in other chaps?\" \"Keep it to ourselves,\" shouted several. \"Well, I dunno,\" Harry Shepherd said; \"if this is going to do us as much good as we hopes, and think it is, would it be right to keep the chaps o\u0027 the place out? O\u0027 course we wouldn\u0027t go beyond Stokebridge, but we might keep it to that.\" The point was hotly debated, the majority being in favour of confining the club to its present members; some saying that if it were opened the original members would be swamped by numbers, and that their bond of union would be broken. When all had spoken Jack Simpson said: \"I think we might go between both opinions. If we were to limit the club to twenty-four members, this room would just about hold \u0027em. We would only elect one each week, so as to have time to make a good choice. Any member who broke the rules or made himself unpleasant would be expelled, and so we should see in a while all the young chaps o\u0027 t\u0027 village wanting to join, and it would get to be looked upon as a feather in a chap\u0027s cap to belong to it.\" This proposal was agreed to unanimously. \"Now the next rule I propose,\" Jack said, \"is that this room is to be used from seven to nine for work. No talking to be allowed. Arter nine, books to be put away and pipes to be lit by them as smoke, and to talk till ten. I ha\u0027 been talking to the woman o\u0027 the house, [Pg 143]and she will supply cups o\u0027 coffee or tea at a penny a piece between nine and ten.\" This rule was agreed to without a dissentient voice. \"Now,\" Jack said, \"I doan\u0027t know as you\u0027ll all like the next rule I ha\u0027 to propose, but I do think it is a needful one. That is that no swearing or bad language be used in this room. A fine of a penny being inflicted for each time the rule be broken.\" There was a dead silence. \"You see,\" Jack said, \"you will all be fined a few times at first, but this money will go to the club fund, and will help up to get fires i\u0027 winter. You\u0027ll soon break yourselves of it, it be only a trick. I did. Mr. Merton told me that it was a bad habit and horrible to decent people. I said I could never break myself o\u0027t. He said if I fined myself a penny every time I did it, and put it in the poor box o\u0027 Sunday, I should soon get out o\u0027 t\u0027way. Well, the first day cost me thirteen pence, the next fourpence, and afterwards it was only a penny now and then. First and last it didn\u0027t cost me half a crown, and you never hear me swear or use bad language now. Come, Bull-dogs, this will be the first step toward improving yourselves, and when you find how easy it be to do wi\u0027out it here, you will soon do wi\u0027out it outside.\" The rule was finally agreed to, but during the first week it carried a good deal of heart-burning in the club. One of the members left altogether, but the rest [Pg 144]soon found that the fines, which had been so alarming for the first day or two, dwindled down. It cost the Bull-dogs collectively over three pounds to cure themselves of using bad language, and the fines kept them in firing, paper, pens, and ink all the winter. On the evening after the opening of the club-room the whole party accompanied by Jack went to the night-school. They looked rather shamefaced as they tramped in, but Jack introduced them one by one to the master, who with a few cordial words put them at their ease. For the first night he contented himself by finding out how much each knew, how much he remembered of what he had formerly heard. For the last half hour he gave them a short lecture on geography, drawing a map on the black-board, taking a traveller from place to place, and telling them what he saw there. Then he set them each a task to be learned and a few sums to be done by the following Friday, and they returned to the club-room greatly pleased with the first night\u0027s lessons. It was not always so light, but the lads were in earnest and really worked hard. Jack visited the room on the off nights, explained questions they did not understand, and after nine o\u0027clock generally read aloud for half an hour while they smoked; that is to say, he read short sentences and then one or other read them after him, Jack correcting mistakes in dialect and pronunciation. Mr. Merton had indeed been a friend to Jack Simp[Pg 145]son, but there was another friend to whom, according to his promise, Jack reported his doings, not telling everything, perhaps, for Jack was not very apt to talk or write about himself; but once a year he sent a letter in reply to a long and wise one which he received from his friend the artist, according to their agreement, for Jack had not \"given up.\" Before the end of a month Mr. Dodgson wrote to Mr. Merton, saying that, thanks to Jack, the night-school was a great success, that the lads all behaved extremely well, and were making really surprising efforts to improve themselves. He augured great things for the village from the movement.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87025.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
