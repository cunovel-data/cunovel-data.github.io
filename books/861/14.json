{"id":44107,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. A HEAVY LOSS.","content":"\"I thought, sir, that you promised to say nothing about that soup-kitchen money,\" Jack said rather indignantly one evening a fortnight after he had gone to work again. \"Here all the women of the place seem to know about it, and as I was coming home from work to-day, there was Mrs. Thompson run out and shook me by the hand and would ha\u0027 kissed me if I\u0027d let her, and said I\u0027d saved her children\u0027s lives. I ha\u0027 been thinking of going away; I can\u0027t stand this; and I thought you promised to say nowt about it.\" \"\u0027Nothing,\u0027 Jack,\" corrected Mr. Merton. \"It is a long time since I heard you say \u0027nowt.\u0027 No, Jack, I did not promise; you told me to say nothing about it, but I was careful not to promise. Sit down, lad, you\u0027re a little hot now, and I am not surprised, but I am sure that you will credit me for having acted for the best.\" Jack sat down with a little grunt, and with the expression of dissatisfaction on his face in no way mollified. [Pg 125] \"In the first place, Jack, you will, I know, be sorry to hear that I am going away.\" \"Going away!\" Jack exclaimed, leaping to his feet, all thought of his grievance gone at once. \"Oh! Mr. Merton.\" \"I told you, you will remember, Jack, when the strike first began, that for the sake of my daughter I should make an effort to obtain a superior position, and I am glad to say that I have done so. I have obtained the post of mathematical master at the Foundation School at Birmingham, with a salary of three hundred a year, and this, Jack, I partly owe to you.\" \"To me!\" Jack exclaimed in astonishment; \"how could that be, sir?\" \"Well, Jack, you got me to write that letter to Sir John Butler, that was the means of bringing the troops over from Birmingham. As we know, they arrived too late, for in point of fact the hot water from the Vaughan boiler put an end to the riot and the strike together. However, Sir John Butler mentioned to Mr. Brook, and the other owners whose mines were threatened, that it was I who at some risk to myself sent the message which brought down the troops. I can assure you that I disclaimed any merit in the affair; however, they chose to consider themselves under an obligation, and when I applied for the vacant mastership, sending in, of course, my college testimonials, they were good enough to exert all their influence with the [Pg 126]governors in my favour, and I was elected unanimously. The salary is an increasing one, and I am to be allowed to coach private pupils for the university. So, Jack, you may congratulate me.\" \"I do, sir, most heartily, most heartily,\" Jack said as he grasped the hand which Mr. Merton held out, but his voice quivered a little and tears stood in his eyes. \"I am glad, indeed, although I shall miss you so terribly, you have been so good to me,\" and Jack fairly broke down now, and cried silently. Mr. Merton put his hand on his shoulder: \"Jack, my work is nearly done, so far as you are concerned. You have worked nearly as far as can be of any use to you in pure mathematics. For the next few months you may go on; but then you had better turn your attention to the useful application of what you have learned. You want to fit yourself to be an engineer, especially, of course, a mining engineer; still the more general your knowledge the better. You will have, therefore, to devote yourself to the various strains and stresses in iron bridges, and the calculation of the strength of the various forms of these structures. Then all calculations as to the expenditure of heat and force in steam engines will be quite material for you to master. In fact, there is work before you for another four or five years. But for much of this you will not require a master. You will find the practical part easy to you when you have a thorough knowledge of mathematics. At the same time if you [Pg 127]will once a week send me your papers, noting all difficulties that you may meet with, I will go through them and answer you, and will also give you papers to work out.\" \"You are very, very kind, sir,\" Jack said; \"but it will not be the same thing as you being here.\" \"No, not quite the same, Jack; still we can hardly help that.\" \"Oh, no, sir!\" Jack said eagerly, \"and please do not think that I am not glad to hear that you have got a place more worthy of you. It was a blow to me just at first, and I was selfish to think of myself even for a moment.\" \"Well, Jack, and now about this question of the soup dinner?\" \"Oh! it does not matter, sir. I had forgot all about it.\" \"It matters a little, Jack, because, although I did not promise to keep silence, I should certainly have respected your wish, had it not been that it seemed to be a far more important matter that the truth should be known.\" \"More important, sir?\" Jack repeated in a puzzled tone. \"More important, Jack. My successor has been chosen. He is just the man for this place—earnest, well trained, a good disciplinarian. He will be no help to you, Jack. He is simply taught and trained as the master of a national school, but he is thoroughly [Pg 128]in earnest. I have told him that his most efficient assistant here will be yourself.\" \"I?\" Jack exclaimed in extreme astonishment. \"You, Jack, not as a teacher, but as an example. You have immense power of doing good, Jack, if you do but choose to exert it.\" Jack was altogether too surprised to speak for some time. \"A power of good,\" he said at last. \"The only good I can do, sir, and that is not much, is to thrash chaps I see bullying smaller boys, but that\u0027s nothing.\" \"Well, that\u0027s something, Jack; and indeed I fear you are fond of fighting.\" \"I am not fond of it,\" Jack said. \"I don\u0027t care about it, one way or the other. It doesn\u0027t hurt me; I am as hard as nails, you see, so I don\u0027t think more about fighting than I do about eating my dinner.\" \"I don\u0027t like fighting, Jack, when it can be avoided, and I don\u0027t think that you are quarrelsome though you do get into so many fights.\" \"Indeed I am not quarrelsome, Mr. Merton; I never quarrel with anyone. If any of the big chaps interfere with us and want to fight, of course I am ready, or if chaps from the other pits think that they can knock our chaps about, of course I show them that the Vaughans can fight, or if I see any fellow pitching in to a young one—\" \"Or, in fact, Jack, on any pretext whatever. Well, if it were anyone else but yourself I should speak [Pg 129]very strongly against it; but in your case I avow that I am glad that you have fought, and fought until, as I know, no one anywhere near your age will fight with you, because it now makes you more useful for my purpose.\" Jack looked astonished again. \"You don\u0027t want me to thrash anyone, Mr. Merton?\" he said; \"because if you do—\" \"No, no, Jack, nothing is further from my thoughts. I want you to get the lads of your own age to join a night-school, and to become a more decent Christian set of young fellows than they are now. It is just because you can fight well, and are looked up to by the lads as their natural leader, that you can do this. Were anyone else to try it he would fail. He would be regarded as a milksop, and be called a girl, and a Molly, and all sorts of names, and no one would join him. Now with you they can\u0027t say this, and boys joining would say to those who made fun of them, \u0027There\u0027s Jack Simpson, he\u0027s one of us; you go and call him Molly and see what you\u0027ll get.\u0027 Now you can talk to your comrades, and point out to them the advantages of learning and decent manners. Show that not only will they become happier men, but that in a worldly point of view they will benefit, for that the mine-owners have difficulty in getting men with sufficient education to act as overmen and viewers. Get them to agree to keep from drink and from the foul language which makes the streets [Pg 130]horrible to a decent person. You can work a revolution in the place. You won\u0027t get them to do all this at present, but the first step is to get them to attend a night-school. I have for the last year been thinking over the matter, and was intending to speak to you about it when the strike began, and everything else was put aside. Now, I have spoken to my successor, and he is willing, and indeed anxious, to open such a school if the young fellows can be induced to come.\" Jack sat for some time in silence. He was always slow at coming to a conclusion, and liked to think over every side of a question. \"How often would it be held, sir?\" he asked presently. \"Two or three nights a week, Jack. Those who are anxious to get on can do as you did, and work between times.\" \"Two nights would be enough at first,\" Jack said; \"but I think, yes, I think I could get some of them to give that. Harry Shepherd would, I\u0027m sure, and Bill Cummings, and Fred Wood, and I think five or six others. Yes, sir, I think we could start it, and all I can do I will. It would do a sight—I mean a great deal of good. I\u0027ll come myself at first, sir, and then if any of them make a noise or play games with the schoolmaster I\u0027ll lick \u0027em next day.\" \"No, Jack, I don\u0027t think that would do, but your presence would no doubt aid the master at first. And [Pg 131]you\u0027ll think of the other things, Jack, the drinking, and the bad language, and so on.\" \"I\u0027ll do what I can, Mr. Merton,\" Jack said, simply, \"but it must be bit by bit.\" \"That\u0027s right, Jack, I knew that I could rely upon you; and now come in to tea, and there was one thing I wanted to say, I want you once a month to come over to me at Birmingham on Saturday afternoon and stay till Sunday evening. It will be a great pleasure to me; I shall see how you are getting on, and shall hear all the news of Stokebridge.\" \"I am very very much obliged to you, sir,\" Jack said, colouring with pleasure, \"but I am afraid I am not, not fit—\" \"You are fit to associate with anyone, Jack, and it is good for you that you should occasionally have other association than that of your comrades of the pit. You will associate with people of higher rank than mine, if you live, and it is well that you should become accustomed to it. And now, Jack, I know you will not take it amiss, but clothes do go for something, and I should advise you to go to a good tailor\u0027s at Birmingham the first time you come over—I will obtain the address of such a one—and order yourself a suit of well made clothes. As you get on in life you will learn that first impressions go a long way, and that the cut of the clothes have not a little to do with first impressions. I shall introduce you to my friends there, simply as a friend; not that either you or I are [Pg 132]ashamed of your working in a pit—indeed, that is your highest credit—but it would spare you the comments and silly questions which would be put to you. Now let us go into the next room, Alice will be expecting us.\" Jack had taken tea with Mr. Merton more than once since that first evening before the strike, and was now much more at his ease with Miss Merton, who, having heard from her father that it was he who saved the Vaughan pit, viewed him with a constant feeling of astonishment. It seemed so strange to her that this quiet lad, who certainly stood in awe of her, although he was a year her senior, should have done such a daring action; equally wonderful to think that in spite of his well chosen words and the attainments her father thought so highly of, he was yet a pit boy, like the rough noisy lads of the village. A week later Mr. Merton and his daughter left Stokebridge, and upon the following day his successor arrived, and Jack, at Mr. Merton\u0027s request, called upon him the same evening. He was a tall man of some forty years old, with a face expressive of quiet power. Jack felt at once that he should like him. He received the lad very kindly. \"I have heard so much of you from Mr. Merton,\" he said, \"and I am sure that you will be a great help to me. Harriet,\" he said to his wife, a bright-looking woman of about thirty-five years old, who came into the room, \"this is Mr. Simpson, of whom Mr. Merton spoke so highly to me. My wife is going to have the girls\u0027 school, have you heard?\" [Pg 133] \"No, indeed,\" Jack said; \"Mr. Merton did not mention it.\" \"It was only settled yesterday; the managers heard that my wife was a trained mistress, and as they were going to pension off the present mistress they offered it to her.\" \"I am very glad,\" Jack said, \"for Mrs. White has long been past her work, and the girls did pretty well as they liked.\" \"I expect to have some trouble with them at first,\" Mrs. Dodgson said cheerfully. \"I often tell my husband girls are ever so much more troublesome than boys, but I daresay I shall manage; and now, Mr. Simpson, we are just going to have supper, will you join us? It will be our first regular meal in the house.\" \"Thank you very much,\" Jack said, colouring and hesitating, \"but I think, perhaps, you don\u0027t know that I am only a lad in the pit.\" \"Stuff and nonsense,\" Mrs. Dodgson said, \"what has that to do with it? Why, Mr. Merton says that you will be John\u0027s right hand. Besides, you will be able to tell us all about the people we shall have to do with.\" In another moment Jack was seated at table, and really enjoyed the meal, lightened, as it was, by the pleasant talk of his hostess, and the grave but not less kindly conversation of her husband.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87024.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
