{"id":44096,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II. BULL-DOG.","content":"A curious group as they sit staring into the fire. Juno and Juno\u0027s daughter Bess, brindles both, with their underhanging lower jaws, and their black noses and wrinkled faces, and Jack Simpson, now six years old, sitting between them, as grave and as immovable as his supporters. One dog is on either side of him and his arms are thrown round their broad backs. Mrs. Haden is laying the table for her husband\u0027s return; she glances occasionally at the quiet group in front of the fire, and mutters to herself: \"I never did see such a child in all my born days.\" Presently a sudden and simultaneous pricking of the closely-cropped ears of Juno and Bess proclaim that among the many footsteps outside they have detected the tread of their master. Jack accepts the intimation and struggles up to his feet just as Bill Haden lifts the latch and enters. \"It\u0027s a fine day, Bill,\" his wife said. [Pg 17]\"Be it?\" the collier replied in return. \"I took no note o\u0027t. However it doant rain, and that\u0027s all I cares for. And how\u0027s the dogs? Did you give Juno that physic ball I got for her?\" \"It\u0027s no manner of use, Bill, leaving they messes wi\u0027 me. I ha\u0027 tould you so scores o\u0027 times. She woant take it from me. She sets her jaws that fast that horses could na pull \u0027em apart, and all the while I\u0027m trying she keeps oop a growl like t\u0027 organ at the church. She\u0027s a\u0027 right wi\u0027out the physic, and well nigh pinned Mrs. Brice when she came in to-day to borrow a flatiron. She was that frighted she skirled out and well nigh fainted off. I had to send Jack round to the \"Chequers\" for two o\u0027 gin before she came round.\" \"Mrs. Brice is a fool and you\u0027re another,\" Bill said. \"Now, ooman, just take off my boots for oim main tired. What be you staring at, Jack? Were you nearly pinning Mother Brice too?\" \"I doant pin folk, I doant,\" Jack said sturdily. \"I kicks \u0027em, I do, but I caught hold o\u0027 Juno\u0027s tail, and held on. And look \u0027ee here, dad, I\u0027ve been a thinking, doant \u0027ee lift I oop by my ears no more, not yet. They are boath main sore. I doant believe neither Juno nor Bess would stand bein lifted oop by their ears, not if they were sore. I be game enough, I be, but till my ears be well you must try some other part. I expect the cheek would hurt just as bad, so you can try that.\" \"I do wish, Bill, you would not try these tricks on the boy. He\u0027s game enough, and if you\u0027d ha\u0027 seen him [Pg 18]fighting to-day with Mrs. Jackson\u0027s Bill, nigh twice as big as himself, you\u0027d ha\u0027 said so too; but it ain\u0027t Christian-like to try children the same way as pups, and really his ears are sore, awful sore. I chanced t\u0027 notice \u0027em when I washed his face afore he went to school, and they be main bad, I tell \u0027ee.\" \"Coom here,\" the miner said to Jack. \"Aye, they be sore surely; why didn\u0027t \u0027ee speak afore, Jack? I doant want to hurt \u0027ee, lad.\" \"I wa\u0027n\u0027t going to speak,\" Jack said. \"Mother found it out, and said she\u0027d tell \u0027ee o\u0027t; but the last two nights I were well nigh yelping when \u0027ee took me up.\" \"You\u0027re a good plucked \u0027un, Jack,\" Bill Haden said, \"and I owt not t\u0027 ha done it, but I didn\u0027t think it hurt \u0027ee, leastways not more nor a boy owt to be hurt, to try if \u0027ee be game!\" \"And what\u0027s you and t\u0027 dogs been doing to-day, Jack?\" the miner asked, as he began at his dinner. \"We went for a walk, dad, after school, out in the lanes; we saw a big black cat, and t\u0027 dogs chased her into a tree, then we got \u0027t a pond, and d\u0027ye know, dad, Bess went in and swam about, she did!\" \"She did?\" the miner said sharply. \"Coom here, Bess;\" and leaving his meal, he began anxiously to examine the bull-dog\u0027s eyes and listened attentively to her breathing. \"That were a rum start for a bull too, Jack. She doant seem to ha\u0027 taken no harm, but maybe it ain\u0027t showed itself. Mother, you give her [Pg 19]some hot grub t\u0027 night. Doant you let her go in t\u0027 water again, Jack. What on airth made her tak it into her head to go into t\u0027 water noo, I wonder?\" \"I can\u0027t help it if she wants to,\" Jack said; \"she doant mind I, not when she doant want to mind. I welted her t\u0027other day when she wanted to go a\u0027t parson\u0027s coo, but she got hold o\u0027 t\u0027 stick and pulled it out o\u0027 my hand.\" \"And quite raight too,\" Bill Haden said; \"don\u0027t \u0027ee try to welt they dogs, or I\u0027ll welt thee!\" \"I doant care,\" the child said sturdily; \"if I goes out in charge o\u0027 they dogs, theys got to mind me, and how can I make \u0027em mind me if I doant welt \u0027em? What would \u0027ee say to I if Bess got had up afore the court for pinning t\u0027 parson\u0027s coo?\" As no ready reply occurred to Bill Haden to this question he returned to his meal. Juno and Bess watched him gravely till he had finished, and then, having each received a lump of meat put carefully aside for them, returned to the fire. Jack, curling himself up beside them, lay with his head on Juno\u0027s body and slept till Mrs. Haden, having cleared the table and washed up the things, sent him out to play, her husband having at the conclusion of his meal lighted his pipe and strolled over to the \"Chequers.\" Bill Haden had, according to his lights, been a good father to the child of his old mate Simpson. He treated him just as if he had been his own. He spent twopence a day less in beer than before, and gave his [Pg 20]wife fourteen pence in addition to her weekly money for household expenses, for milk for the kid, just as he allowed twopence a day each for bones for Juno and Bess. He also when requested by his wife handed over what sum was required for clothing and shoes, not without grumbling, however, and comparisons as to the wants of dorgs and boys, eminently unfavourable to the latter. The weekly twopence for schooling Mrs. Haden had, during the year that Jack had been at school, paid out of her housekeeping money, knowing that the expenses of the dogs afforded no precedent whatever for such a charge. Bill Haden was, however, liberal to the boy in many ways, and when in a good temper would often bestow such halfpence as he might have in his pocket upon him, and now and then taking him with him into town, returned with such clothes and shoes that \"mother\" held up her hands at the extravagance. Among his young companions Jack was liked but feared. When he had money he would purchase bull\u0027s-eyes, and collecting all his acquaintances, distribute them among them; but he was somewhat sedate and old-fashioned in his ways, from his close friendships with such thoughtful and meditative animals as Juno and Bess, and when his wrath was excited he was terrible. Never uttering a cry, however much hurt, he would fight with an obstinacy and determination which generally ended by giving him the victory, for if he once got hold of an antagonist\u0027s hair—pinning [Pg 21]coming to him naturally—no amount of blows or ill-treatment could force him to leave go until his agonized opponent confessed himself vanquished. It was not often, however, that Jack came in contact with the children of his own age. His duties as guardian of the \"dorgs\" absorbed the greater part of his time, and as one or both of these animals generally accompanied him when he went beyond the door, few cared about having anything to say to him when so attended; for the guardianship was by no means entirely on his side, and however excellent their qualities and pure their breed, neither Juno nor Bess were animals with whom strangers would have ventured upon familiarity. Jack\u0027s reports to his \"dad\" of Bess\u0027s inclination to attack t\u0027 parson\u0027s coo was not without effect, although Bill Haden had made no remark at the time. That night, however, he observed to his wife: \"I\u0027ve been a thinking it over, Jane, and I be come to the opinion that it\u0027s better t\u0027 boy should not go out any more wi\u0027 t\u0027 dorgs. Let \u0027em bide at home, I\u0027ll take \u0027em oot when they need it. If Bess takes it into her head to pin a coo there might be trouble, an I doan\u0027t want trouble. Her last litter o\u0027 pups brought me a ten pun note, and if they had her oop at \u0027a court and swore her life away as a savage brute, which she ain\u0027t no way, it would pretty nigh break my heart.\" The execution of this, as of many other good intentions, however, was postponed until an event happened [Pg 22]which led to Jack\u0027s being definitely relieved of the care of his canine friends. Two years had passed, when one morning Jack was calmly strolling along the road accompanied by Juno and Bess. A gig came rapidly along containing two young bagmen, as commercial travellers were still called in Stokebridge. The driver, seeing a child with two dogs, conceived that this was a favourable opportunity for a display of that sense of playful humour whose point lies in the infliction of pain on others, without any danger of personal consequences to the inflictor. With a sharp sweep he brought down his whip across Jack\u0027s back, managing to include Bess in the stroke. Jack set up a shout of mingled pain and indignation, and stooping for a stone, hurled it after the man who had struck him. Bess\u0027s response to the assault upon her was silent, but as prompt and far more effectual. With two springs she was beside the horse, and leaping up caught it by the nostrils and dragged it to the ground. Juno at once joined in the fray, and made desperate attempts to climb into the gig and seize its inmates, who had nearly been thrown out as the horse fell. Recovering himself, the driver, pale with terror, clubbed his whip, and struck at Juno with the butt-end. \"Don\u0027t \u0027ee hit her,\" Jack cried as he arrived on the spot; \"if thou dost she\u0027ll tear \u0027ee limb from limb.\" [Pg 23] \"Call the brute off, you little rascal,\" cried the other, \"it\u0027s killing the horse.\" \"Thou\u0027d best keep a civil tongue in thy head,\" the child said coolly, \"or it will be bad for \u0027ee. What did \u0027ee hit I and Bess for? It would serve \u0027ee roight if she had pinned \u0027ee instead o\u0027 t\u0027 horse.\" \"Call them off,\" the fellow shouted as Juno\u0027s teeth met in close proximity to his leg. \"It be all very well to say call \u0027em orf,\" Jack said, \"but they doan\u0027t moind I much. Have \u0027ee got a strap?\" The man hastily threw down a strap, and this Jack passed through Juno\u0027s collar, she being too absorbed in her efforts to climb into the gig to heed what the child was doing; then he buckled it to the wheel. \"Noo,\" he said, \"ye can light down t\u0027 other side. She caan\u0027t reach \u0027ee there.\" The young men leapt down, and ran to the head of the horse; the poor brute was making frantic efforts to rise, but the bull-dog held him down with her whole might. Jack shouted and pulled, but in vain; Bess paid no attention to his voice. \"Can you bite his tail?\" one of the frightened men said; \"I\u0027ve heard that is good.\" \"Boite her tail!\" Jack said in contempt; \"doan\u0027t yer see she\u0027s a full-bred un; ye moight boite her tail off, and she would care nowt about \u0027t. I\u0027ve got summat here that may do.\" He drew out a twisted paper from his pocket. [Pg 24] \"This is snuff,\" he said; \"if owt will make her loose, this will. Now one o\u0027 yer take holt by her collar on each side, and hoult tight, yer know, or she\u0027ll pin ye when she leaves go o\u0027 the horse. Then when she sneezes you pull her orf, and hoult fast.\" The fear of the men that the horse would be killed overpowered their dread of the dog, and each took a firm grip upon its collar. Then Jack placed a large pinch of snuff to its nostrils. A minute later it took effect, the iron jaws unclosed with a snap, and in an instant Bess was snatched away from the horse, which, delivered from its terrible foe, sank back groaning on the road. Bess made the most furious attempts to free herself from her captors, but in vain, and Juno strained desperately at the strap to come to the assistance of her offspring. \"Ha\u0027 ye got another strap?\" Jack asked. \"There\u0027s a chain in the box under the seat.\" Jack with some difficulty and an amount of deliberation for which the men could gladly have slain him, climbed up into the gig, and presently came back with the chain. \"Noo tak\u0027 her round to t\u0027 other side o\u0027 gig,\" he said; \"we\u0027ll fasten her just as Juno is.\" When Bess was securely chained to the wheel the men ran to raise the horse, who lay with its head in a pool of blood. \"There\u0027s a pond in yon field,\" Jack said, \"if \u0027ee wants water.\" [Pg 25] After Bess was secured Jack had slipped round to Juno, and kept his hand upon the buckle in readiness to loose her should any attempt be made upon his personal safety. The men, however, were for the moment too scared to think of him. It was some time before the horse was got on to its legs, with a wet cloth wrapped round its bleeding wound. Fortunately Bess\u0027s grip had included the bit-strap as well as the nostrils, and this had somewhat lessened the serious nature of the hurt. Jack had by this time pacified the dogs, and when the men looked round, after getting the horse on to its legs, they were alarmed to see him standing by quietly holding the dogs by a strap passing through their collar. \"Doan\u0027t \u0027ee try to get into that ere cart,\" he said; \"you\u0027ve got to go wi\u0027 me back to Stokebridge to t\u0027 lock-oop for hitting I and Bess. Now do you walk quietly back and lead t\u0027 horse, and oi\u0027ll walk beside \u0027ee, and if thou mov\u0027st, or tries to get away, oi\u0027ll slip t\u0027 dogs, you see if I doan\u0027t.\" \"You little villain,\" began one of the men furiously, but a deep growl from Bess in reply to the angry tone at once silenced him; and burning with rage they turned the horse\u0027s head back towards the village and walked on, accompanied by Jack and his dogs on guard. The arrival of this procession created much excitement, and a crowd of women and children soon [Pg 26]gathered. Jack, however, serenely indifferent to questions and shouts, proceeded coolly on his way until he arrived at the residence of the local constable, who, hearing the din, appeared at his door. \"Maister Johnson,\" the child says, \"I give them chaps in charge for saulting I and Bess.\" \"And we give this little ruffian in charge,\" shouted the men, secure that, in face of the constable and crowd, Jack could not loose his terrible bull-dogs, \"for setting his dogs at us, to the risk of our lives and the injury of our horse, which is so much hurt that we believe it will have to be killed.\" Just at this moment Bill Haden—who had returned from work at the moment that a boy running in reported that there was a row, that a horse was covered wi\u0027 blood, and two chaps all bluidy over t\u0027 hands and clothes, were agoing along wi\u0027 Jack and t\u0027 dorgs oop street to lock-oop—arrived upon the spot. \"What\u0027s oop, lad?\" he asked as he came up. \"They chaps hit I and Bess, dad, and Bess pinned t\u0027 horse, and Juno would ha\u0027 pinned \u0027em boath hadn\u0027t I strapped she oop, and then we got Bess orf, and I brought \u0027em back to t\u0027 lock-oop.\" \"How dar \u0027ee hit my lad?\" Bill Haden said angrily, stepping forward threateningly. \"Look oot, dad, or t\u0027 dogs will be at \u0027em again,\" Jack shouted. Bill seized the strap from the child\u0027s hand, and with a stern word silenced the dogs. [Pg 27] \"Well,\" the constable said, \"I can\u0027t do nowt but bring both parties afore Mr. Brook i\u0027 the morning. I suppose I needn\u0027t lock \u0027ee all oop. Bill, will you bind yourself to produce Jack Simpson t\u0027morrow?\" \"Ay,\" said Bill, \"oi\u0027ll produce him, and he\u0027ll produce hisself, I\u0027m thinking; seems to me as Jack be able to take \u0027s own part.\" This sally was received with laughter and applause, for local feeling was very strong in Stokebridge, and a storm of jeers and rough chaff were poured upon the bagmen for having been brought in prisoners by a child. \"Thee\u0027d best get away to th\u0027 inn,\" the constable said, \"else they\u0027ll be a stoaning thee next. There be only two on us here, and if they takes to \u0027t we sha\u0027n\u0027t be able to do much.\" So the men, leading their horse, went off to the Inn, groaned and hooted at by the crowd on the way. On their arrival a messenger was at once sent off for a veterinary surgeon who resided some four miles away. On the following morning the parties to the quarrel, the two bagmen and the injured horse on the one hand, and Jack Simpson with the two bull-dogs under charge of Bill Haden on the other, appeared before Mr. Brook, owner of the Vaughan pit and a county magistrate. Jack first gave his account of the transaction, clearly and with much decision. \"I war a walking along quiet wi\u0027 t\u0027 dogs,\" he said, \"when I hears a cart a coming from Stokebridge. I [Pg 28]looks round and seed they two chaps, but didn\u0027t mind no further about it till as they came oop that sandy-haired chap as was a driving lets me and Bess ha\u0027 one which made me joomp, I can tell \u0027ee. Bess she pinned the horse, and Juno she tried to get into t\u0027 cart at \u0027em. They were joost frighted, they hollers, and yawps, and looks as white as may be. I fastens Juno oop wi\u0027 a strap and they houlds Bess while I poot some snoof t\u0027 her nose.\" \"Put what?\" Mr. Brook asked. \"Joost a pinch of snoof, sir. I heard feyther say as snoof would make dogs loose, and so I bought a haporth and carried it in my pocket, for th\u0027 dogs don\u0027t moind oi when they are put oot. And then they gets horse oop and I makes \u0027em come back to t\u0027 lock-oop, but maister Johnson,\" he said, looking reproachfully at the constable, \"wouldn\u0027t lock \u0027em oop as I wanted him.\" There was some laughter among the audience, and even the magistrate smiled. The young men then gave their story. They denied point blank that either of them had struck Jack, and described him as having set his dog purposely on the horse. Jack had loudly contradicted them, shouting, \u0027That\u0027s a lee;\u0027 but had been ordered to silence. Then drawing back he slipped off his jacket and shirt, and when the evidence was closed he marched forward up to the magistrate bare to the waist. \"Look at moi back,\" he said; \"that \u0027ull speak for itself.\" [Pg 29] It did; there was a red weal across the shoulder, and an angry hiss ran through the court at the prisoners, which was with difficulty suppressed. \"After what I have seen,\" Mr. Brook said, \"there is no doubt whatever in my mind that the version given by this child is the correct one, and that you committed a cowardly and unprovoked assault upon him. For this you,\" he said to the man who had driven the horse, \"are fined ￡5 or a month\u0027s imprisonment. It is a good thing that cowardly fellows like you should be punished occasionally, and had it not been that your horse had been severely injured I should have committed you to prison without option of a fine. Against you,\" he said to the other, \"there is no evidence of assault. The charge against the child is dismissed, but it is for the father to consider whether he will prosecute you for perjury. At the same time I think that dogs of this powerful and ferocious kind ought not to be allowed to go out under the charge of a child like this.\" The man paid the fine; but so great was the indignation of the crowd that the constable had to escort them to the railway-station; in spite of this they were so pelted and hustled on the way that they were miserable figures indeed when they arrived there. And so Jack was released from all charge of the \"dorgs,\" and benefited by the change. New friendships for children of his own age took the place of that for the dogs, and he soon took part in their games, and, [Pg 30]from the energy and violence with which, when once excited, he threw himself into them, became quite a popular leader. Mrs. Haden rejoiced over the change; for he was now far more lively and more like other children than he had been, although still generally silent except when addressed by her and drawn into talk. He was as fond as ever of the dogs, but that fondness was now a part only instead of the dominating passion of his existence. And so months after months went on and no event of importance occurred to alter the current of Jack Simpson\u0027s life.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87013.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
