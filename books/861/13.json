AFTER THE STRIKE.","content":"\"W ell, Jack, so you\u0027re back again,\" Nelly Hardy said as she met Jack Simpson on his way home from work on the first day after his return. \"Ay, Nelly, and glad to see you. How have things gone on?\" and he nodded towards her home. \"Better than I ever knew them,\" the girl said. \"When father could not afford to buy drink we had better times than I have ever known. It was a thousand times better to starve than as \u0027twas before. He\u0027s laid up still; you nigh scalded him to death, Jack, and I doubt he\u0027ll never be fit for work again.\" \"I,\" Jack exclaimed, astounded, for he believed that the secret was known only to his mother, Harry, John Ratcliffe, Mr. Merton and perhaps the schoolmaster\u0027s daughter. \"Has Harry—\" \"No, Harry has not said a word. Oh, Jack, I didn\u0027t think it of you. You call me a friend and keep this a secret, you let Harry know it and say nowt to me. [Pg 118]I did not think it of you,\" and the dark eyes filled with tears. \"But if Harry did not tell you, how—\" \"As if I wanted telling,\" she said indignantly. \"Who would have dared do it but you? Didn\u0027t I know you were here an hour or two before, and you think I needed telling who it was as faced all the pitmen? and to think you hid it from me! Didn\u0027t you think I could be trusted? couldn\u0027t I have gone to fetch the redcoats for you? couldn\u0027t I have sat by you in the engine-house, and waited and held your hand when you stood against them all? oh, Jack!\" and for the first time since their friendship had been pledged, nearly four years before, Jack saw Nelly burst into tears. \"I didn\u0027t mean unkind, Nell, I didn\u0027t, indeed, and if I had wanted another messenger I would have come to you. Don\u0027t I know you are as true as steel? Come, lass, don\u0027t take on. I would have sent thee instead o\u0027 Harry only I thought he could run fastest. Girls\u0027 wind ain\u0027t as good as lads\u0027.\" \"And you didn\u0027t doubt I\u0027d do it, Jack?\" \"Not for a moment,\" Jack said. \"I would have trusted thee as much as Harry.\" \"Well then, I forgive you, Jack, but if ever you get in danger again, and doant let me know, I\u0027ll never speak a word to you again.\" In the years which had passed since this friendship began Nelly Hardy had greatly changed. The com[Pg 119]panionship of two quiet lads like Jack and Harry had tamed her down, and her love of reading and her study of all the books on history and travel on Jack\u0027s book-shelves had softened her speech. When alone the three spoke with but little of the dialect of the place, Jack having insisted on improvement in this respect. With Nelly his task had been easy, for she was an apt pupil, but Harry still retained some of his roughness of speech. Nelly was fifteen now, and was nearly as tall as Jack, who was square and somewhat stout for his age. With these two friends Jack would talk sometimes of his hopes of rising and making a way for himself. Harry, who believed devoutly in his friend, entered most warmly into his hopes, but Nelly on this subject alone was not sympathetic. \"You don\u0027t say anything,\" Jack remarked one day; \"do you think my castles in the air will never come true?\" \"I know they will come true, Jack,\" she said earnestly; \"but don\u0027t ask me to be glad. I can\u0027t; I try to but I can\u0027t. It\u0027s selfish, but, but—\" and her voice quivered. \"Every step thou takest will carry you farther up from me, and I can\u0027t be glad on it, Jack!\" \"Nonsense, Nelly,\" Jack said angrily, \"dos\u0027t think so little of me as to think that I shall not be as true to my two friends, Harry and you, as I am now?\" The girl shook her head. [Pg 120] \"You will try, Jack, you will try. Don\u0027t think I doubt you, but—\" and turning round she fled away at full speed. \"I believe she ran away because she was going to cry,\" Harry said. \"Lasses are strange things, and though in some things Nell\u0027s half a lad, yet she\u0027s soft you see on some points. Curious, isn\u0027t it, Jack?\" \"Very curious,\" Jack said; \"I thought I understood Nell as well as I did you or myself, but I begin to think I doant understand her as much as I thought. It comes of her being a lass, of course, but it\u0027s queer too,\" and Jack shook his head over the mysterious nature of lasses. \"You can\u0027t understand \u0027em,\" he went on again, thoughtfully. \"Now, if you wanted some clothes, Harry, and you were out of work, I should just buy you a set as a matter of course, and you\u0027d take \u0027em the same. It would be only natural like friends, wouldn\u0027t it?\" Harry assented. \"Now, I\u0027ve been wanting to give Nelly a gown, and a jacket, and hat for the last two years. I want her to look nice, and hold her own with the other lasses of the place—she\u0027s as good looking as any—but I daren\u0027t do it. No, I daren\u0027t, downright. I know, as well as if I see it, how she\u0027d flash up, and how angry she\u0027d be.\" \"Why should she?\" Harry asked. \"That\u0027s what I doan\u0027t know, lad, but I know she would be. I suppose it comes of her being a lass, but [Pg 121]it beats me altogether. Why shouldn\u0027t she take it? other lasses take presents from their lads, why shouldn\u0027t Nell take one from her friend? But she wouldn\u0027t, I\u0027d bet my life she wouldn\u0027t, and she wouldn\u0027t say, \u0027No, and thank you,\u0027 but she\u0027d treat it as if I\u0027d insulted her. No, it can\u0027t be done, lad; but it\u0027s a pity, for I should ha\u0027 liked to see her look nice for once.\" Not satisfied with his inability to solve the question Jack took his mother into his confidence. Jane Haden smiled. \"Noa, Jack, I don\u0027t think as how thou canst give Nell Hardy a dress. She is a good quiet girl and keeps herself respectable, which, taking into account them she comes from, is a credit to her, but I don\u0027t think thou could\u0027st gi\u0027 her a gown.\" \"But why not, mother?\" Jack persisted. \"I might gi\u0027 her a pair o\u0027 earrings or a brooch, I suppose, which would cost as much as the gown.\" \"Yes, thou might\u0027st do that, Jack.\" \"Then if she could take the thing which would be no manner o\u0027 use to her, why couldn\u0027t she take the thing that would?\" \"I doant know as I can rightly tell you, Jack, but there\u0027s a difference.\" \"But can\u0027t you tell me what is the difference?\" Jack insisted. \"Noa, Jack, I can\u0027t, but there be a difference.\" Jack seized his candle with a cry of despair, and ran [Pg 122]upstairs. He had solved many a tough problem, but this was beyond him altogether. He was not, however, accustomed to be baffled, and the next day he renewed the subject, this time to Nelly herself. \"Look here, Nell,\" he said, \"I want to ask you a question. It is a supposition, you know, only a supposition, but it bothers me.\" \"What is it, Jack?\" she said, looking up from the ground, upon which as was her custom she was sitting with a book while Jack sat on a gate. \"If I was to offer you a pair of gold earrings.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t take \u0027em,\" the girl said rising, \"you know I wouldn\u0027t, Jack; you know I never take presents from you.\" \"I know, lass, I know. We\u0027ll suppose you wouldn\u0027t take it, but you wouldn\u0027t be angered, would you?\" \"I should be angered that you had spent money foolishly,\" the girl said after a pause, \"when you knew I shouldn\u0027t take it, but I couldn\u0027t be angered any other way.\" \"Well, but if I were to buy you a hat and a jacket and a gown.\" \"You dare not,\" the girl said passionately, her face flushed scarlet; \"you dare not, Jack.\" \"No,\" Jack said consciously, \"I know I dare not, though I should like to; but why don\u0027t I dare?\" \"Because it would be an insult, a gross insult, Jack, and you dare not insult me.\" \"No lass, I darena; but why should it be an insult? [Pg 123]that\u0027s what I canna make out; why wouldn\u0027t it be an insult to offer you a gold brooch worth three or four pounds, and yet be an insult to offer you the other things? what\u0027s the difference?\" Nelly had calmed down now when she saw that the question was a hypothetical one, and that Jack had not, as she at first supposed, bought clothes for her. She thought for some time. \"I suppose, Jack, the difference is this. It\u0027s the duty of a girl\u0027s father and mother to buy fit clothes for her, and if they don\u0027t it\u0027s either their fault, or it\u0027s because they are too poor. So to give clothes is an interference and a sort of reproach. A brooch is not necessary; it\u0027s a pretty ornament, and so a lad may give it to his lass wi\u0027out shame.\" \"Yes, I suppose it must be that,\" Jack said thoughtfully. \"I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve got some sort of answer.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87023.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
