{"id":44097,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III. THE RESOLUTION.","content":"A n artist sitting in the shade under a tree, painting a bit of rustic gate and a lane bright with many honeysuckles. Presently he is conscious of a movement behind him, and looking round, sees a sturdily built boy of some ten years of age, with an old bull-dog lying at his feet, and another standing by his side, watching him. \"Well, lad, what are you doing?\" \"Nowt!\" said the boy promptly. \"I mean,\" the artist said with a smile, \"have you anything to do? if not, I will give you sixpence to sit still on that gate for a quarter of an hour. I want a figure.\" The boy nodded, took his seat without a word, and remained perfectly quiet while the artist sketched him in. \"That will do for the present,\" the artist said. \"You can come and sit down here and look at me at work if you like; but if you have nothing to do for an hour, don\u0027t go away, as I shall want you again [Pg 32]presently. Here is the sixpence; you will have another if you\u0027ll wait. What\u0027s your name?\" he went on, as the boy threw himself down on the grass, with his head propped up on his elbows. \"Bull-dog,\" the lad said promptly; and then colouring up, added \"at least they call me Bull-dog, but my right name be Jack Simpson.\" \"And why do they call you Bull-dog, Jack?\" The artist had a sympathetic voice and spoke in tones of interest, and the lad answered frankly: \"Mother—that is, my real mother—she died when I were a little kid, and Juno here, she had pups at the time—not that one, she\u0027s Flora, three years old she be—and they used to pretend she suckled me. It bain\u0027t likely, be it?\" he asked, as if after all he was not quite sure about it himself. \"Schoolmaster says as how it\u0027s writ that there was once two little rum\u0027uns, suckled by a wolf, but he can\u0027t say for sure that it\u0027s true. Mother says it\u0027s all a lie, she fed me from a bottle. But they called me Bull-dog from that, and because Juno and me always went about together; and now they call me so because,\" and he laughed, \"I take a good lot of licking before I gives in.\" \"You\u0027ve been to school, I suppose, Jack?\" \"Yes, I\u0027ve had five years schooling,\" the boy said carelessly. \"And do you like it?\" \"I liked it well enough; I learnt pretty easy, and so \u0027scaped many hidings. Dad says it was cos my [Pg 33]mother were a schoolmaster\u0027s daughter afore she married my father, and so learning\u0027s in the blood, and comes natural. But I\u0027m done with school now, and am going down the pit next week.\" \"What are you going to do there? You are too young for work.\" \"Oh, I sha\u0027n\u0027t have no work to do int\u0027 pit, not hard work—just to open and shut a door when the tubs go through.\" \"You mean the coal-waggons?\" \"Ay, the tubs,\" the boy said. \"Then in a year or two I shall get to be a butty, that ull be better pay; then I shall help dad in his stall, and at last I shall be on full wages.\" \"And after that?\" the artist asked. The lad looked puzzled. \"What will you look forward to after that?\" \"I don\u0027t know that there\u0027s nowt else,\" the boy said, \"except perhaps some day I might, perhaps—but it ain\u0027t likely—but I might get to be a viewer.\" \"But why don\u0027t you make up your mind to be something better still, Jack—a manager?\" \"What!\" exclaimed the boy incredulously; \"a manager, like Fenton, who lives in that big house on the hill! Why, he\u0027s a gentleman.\" \"Jack,\" the artist said, stopping in his work now, and speaking very earnestly, \"there is not a lad of your age in the land, brought up as a miner, or a mechanic, or an artisan, who may not, if he sets it before him, and [Pg 34]gives his whole mind to it, end by being a rich man and a gentleman. If a lad from the first makes up his mind to three things—to work, to save, and to learn—he can rise in the world. You won\u0027t be able to save out of what you get at first, but you can learn when your work is done. You can read and study of an evening. Then when you get better wages, save something; when, at twenty-one or so, you get man\u0027s wages, live on less than half, and lay by the rest. Don\u0027t marry till you\u0027re thirty; keep away from the public-house; work, study steadily and intelligently; and by the time you are thirty you will have a thousand pounds laid by, and be fit to take a manager\u0027s place.\" \"Do\u0027st mean that, sir?\" the boy asked quickly. \"I do, Jack. My case is something like it. My father was a village schoolmaster. I went when about twelve years old to a pottery at Burslem. My father told me pretty well what I have told you. I determined to try hard at any rate. I worked in every spare hour to improve myself generally, and I went three evenings a week to the art school. I liked it, and the master told me if I stuck to it I might be a painter some day. I did stick to it, and at twenty could paint well enough to go into that branch of pottery. I stuck to it, and at five-and-twenty was getting as high pay as any one in Burslem, except one or two foreign artists. I am thirty now. I still paint at times on china, but I am now getting well known as an artist, and am, I hope, a gentleman.\" [Pg 35] \"I\u0027ll do it,\" the boy said, rising slowly to his feet and coming close to the artist. \"I\u0027ll do it, sir. They call me Bull-dog, and I\u0027ll stick to it.\" \"Very well,\" the artist said, holding out his hand; \"that\u0027s a bargain, Jack. Now, give me your name and address; here are mine. It\u0027s the 1st of June to-day. Now perhaps it will help you a little if I write to you on the 1st of June every year; and you shall answer me, telling me how you are getting on, and whether I can in any way give you help or advice. If I don\u0027t get an answer from you, I shall suppose that you have got tired of it and have given it up.\" \"Don\u0027t you never go to suppose that, sir,\" the boy said earnestly. \"If thou doesn\u0027t get an answer thou\u0027llt know that I\u0027ve been killed, as father was, in a fall or an explosion. Thank you, sir.\" And the boy walked quietly off, with the old bull-dog lazily waddling behind him. \"There are the makings of a man in that boy,\" the artist said to himself. \"I wish though I had finished his figure before we began to talk about his plans for the future. I shall be very proud of that boy if he ever makes a name for himself.\" That evening Jack sat on a low stool and gazed into the fire so steadily and silently that Bill Haden, albeit not given to observe his moods, asked: \"What ail\u0027st, lad? What be\u0027st thinkin\u0027 o\u0027?\" Jack\u0027s thoughts were so deep that it took him some time to shake them off and to turn upon his stool. [Pg 36] \"Oi\u0027m thinking o\u0027 getting larning.\" \"Thinking o\u0027 getting larning!\" the miner repeated in astonishment, \"why, \u0027ee be just a dun o\u0027 getting larning. \u0027Ee ha\u0027 been at it for the last foive year, lad, and noo thou\u0027st going to be done wi\u0027 it and to work in the pit.\" \"Oi\u0027m a going to work in the pit, dad, and oi\u0027m a gwine to get larning too. Oi\u0027ve made oop my mind, and oi\u0027m gwine to do it.\" \"But bain\u0027t \u0027ee got larning?\" the miner said. \"Thou canst read and write foine, which is more nor I can do and what dost want more?\" \"Oi\u0027m a going to get larning,\" Jack said again, steadily repeating the formula, \"and oi\u0027m gwine soom day to be a manager.\" Bill Haden stared at the boy and then burst into a fit of laughter. \"Well, this bangs a\u0027.\" Mrs. Haden was as surprised but more sympathetic. \"Bless the boy, what hast got in your head now?\" Jack showed not the slightest sign of discomfiture at his father\u0027s laughter. \"I met a chap to-day,\" he said in answer to Mrs. Haden, \"as told I that if I made up my moind to work and joost stuck to \u0027t, I could surely make a man o\u0027 myself, and might even roise soom day to be a manager; and I\u0027m a going to do it.\" \"Doant \u0027ee say a word to check the boy, Bill,\" Mrs. Haden said to her husband, as he was about to burst out into jeering remarks. \"I tell \u0027ee, what Jack says [Pg 37]he sticks to, and you oughter know that by this time. What the man, whos\u0027ever he might be, said, was right, Jack,\" she went on, turning to the boy. \"Larning is a great thing. So far you ain\u0027t showed any turn for larning, Jack, as I ever see\u0027d, but if you get it you may raise yourself to be an overman or a viewer, though I doan\u0027t say a manager; that seems too far away altogether. If you stick to what you say you may do it, Jack. I can\u0027t help you in larning, for I ain\u0027t got none myself, but if I can help you in any other way I \u0027ull, and so \u0027ull feyther, though he does laugh a bit.\" \"He be roight enough to laugh,\" Jack said, \"for I hain\u0027t had any turn that way, I doant know as I ha\u0027 now, but I\u0027m a going to try, and if trying can do it,\" he said in his steady tones, \"oi\u0027ll do it. I think I ha\u0027 got some o\u0027 the bull-dog strain in me, and I\u0027ll hoult on to it as Bess would hoult on to a man\u0027s throat if she pinned him.\" \"I know you will, my lad,\" Mrs. Haden said, while her husband, lighting his pipe and turning to go out, said: \"It matters nowt to me one way or t\u0027other, but moind, lad, larning or no larning, thou\u0027st got to go into the pit next week and arn your living.\" \"Jack,\" Mrs. Haden said presently, \"dost know, I wouldn\u0027t do nowt wi\u0027 this new fancy o\u0027 thine, not till arter thou\u0027st a been to work i\u0027 the pit for a while; a week or two will make no differ to \u0027ee, and thou doan\u0027t know yet how tired ye\u0027ll be when ye coom oop [Pg 38]nor how thou\u0027lt long for the air and play wi\u0027 lads o\u0027 thy own age. I believe, Jack, quite believe that thou be\u0027st in arnest on it, and I know well that when thou dost begin thou\u0027lt stick to \u0027t. But it were better to wait till thou know\u0027st what \u0027tis thou art undertaking.\" Jack felt that there was a good deal in what his mother said. \"Very well, mother. \u0027Twant make no differ to me, but oi\u0027ll do as th\u0027 asks me.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87014.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
