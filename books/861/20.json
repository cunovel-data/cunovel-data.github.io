{"id":44113,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. THE GREAT RIOT.","content":"S tokebridge feast had not gone off with its usual spirit. The number of young pitmen and lads from the surrounding villages were as large as ever, and there was no lack of lasses in gay bonnets and bright dresses. The fact, however, that almost the whole of the lads and girls of Stokebridge between the ages of fifteen and eighteen had left the village and gone to a rival fête elsewhere, cast a damper on the proceedings. There were plenty of young women and young men in Stokebridge who were as ready as ever to dance and to drink, and who were, perhaps, even gaudier in attire and more boisterous in manner than usual, as a protest against the recession of their juniors; for Stokebridge was divided into two very hostile camps, and, as was perhaps not unnatural, those over the age of the girls and lads at the night-schools resented the changes which had been made, and rebelled against the, as they asserted, airs of superiority of younger sisters and brothers. In some cases no doubt there was ground for the [Pg 184]feeling. The girls and lads, eager to introduce the new lessons of order and neatness which they had learned, may have gone too fast and acted with too much zeal, although their teacher had specially warned them against so doing. Hence the feeling of hostility to the movement was strong among a small section of Stokebridge, and the feeling was heightened by the secession in a body of the young people from the feast. As the day went on the public-houses were as full as ever, indeed it was said that never before had so much liquor been consumed; the fiddles played and the dancing and boisterous romping went on as usual, but there was less real fun and enjoyment. As evening came on the young fellows talked together in angry groups. Whether the proposal emanated from some of the Stokebridge men or from the visitors from other villages was afterwards a matter of much dispute, but it gradually became whispered about among the dancing booths and public-houses that there was an intention to give the party from Brook\u0027s a warm reception when they arrived. Volleys of mud and earth were prepared, and some of the overdressed young women tossed their heads, and said that a spattering with mud would do the stuck-up girls no harm. The older pitmen, who would have certainly opposed any such design being carried out, were kept in ignorance of what was intended; the greater portion were indeed drunk long before the time came when the party would be returning from the fête. [Pg 185] At a quarter before twelve Jane Haden, who had been sitting quietly at home, went up to the \"Chequers\" to look after her husband, and to see about his being brought home should he be incapable of walking. The music was still playing in the dancing booths, but the dancing was kept up without spirit, for a number of young men and lads were gathered outside. As she passed she caught a few words which were sufficient to inform her of what was going on. \"Get some sticks oot o\u0027 hedges.\" \"Fill your pockets oop wi\u0027 stones.\" \"We\u0027ll larn \u0027em to spoil the feast.\" Jane saw that an attack was going to be made upon the party, and hesitated for a moment what to do. The rockets were going up in Mr. Brook\u0027s grounds, and she knew she had a few minutes yet. First she ran to the house of James Shepherd. The pitman, who was a sturdy man, had been asleep for the last three hours. She knocked at the door, unlocked it, and went in. \"Jim,\" she called in a loud voice. \"Aye, what be\u0027t?\" said a sleepy voice upstairs; \"be\u0027t thou, Harry and Sally?\" \"No, it be I, Jane Haden; get up quickly, Jim; quick, man, there be bad doings, and thy lad and lass are like to have their heads broke if no worse.\" Alarmed by the words and the urgent manner of his neighbour, Jim and his wife slipped on a few clothes and came down. Jane at once told them what she had heard. [Pg 186] \"There be between two and three hundred of \u0027em,\" she said, \"as far as I could see the wust lot out o\u0027 Stokebridge, and a lot o\u0027 roughs from t\u0027 other villages. Quick, Jim, do you and Ann go round quick to the houses o\u0027 all the old hands who ha\u0027 kept away from the feast or who went home drunk early, they may ha\u0027 slept \u0027t off by this, and get \u0027un together. Let \u0027em take pick-helves, and if there\u0027s only twenty of ye and ye fall upon this crowd ye\u0027ll drive \u0027em. If ye doan\u0027t it will go bad wi\u0027 all our lads and lasses. I\u0027ll go an\u0027 warn \u0027em, and tell \u0027em to stop a few minutes on t\u0027 road to give \u0027ee time to coom up. My Jack and the lads will foight, no fear o\u0027 that, but they can\u0027t make head agin so many armed wi\u0027 sticks and stones too; but if ye come up behind and fall on \u0027em when it begins ye\u0027ll do, even though they be stronger.\" Fully awake now to the danger which threatened the young people, for the pitman and his wife knew that when blows were exchanged and blood heated things would go much further than was at first intended, they hurried off to get a few men together, while Jane Haden started for the hall. Already the riotous crowd had gone on and she had to make a detour, but she regained the road, and burst breathless and panting into the midst of the throng of young people coming along the lane chatting gaily of the scenes of the evening. \"Stop, stop!\" she cried; \"don\u0027t go a foot further—where be my Jack?\" [Pg 187] \"It\u0027s Mrs. Haden,\" Nelly Hardy said. \"Jack, it\u0027s your mother.\" \"What is it?\" Jack said in astonishment. \"Anything wrong wi\u0027 dad?\" \"Stop!\" Mrs. Haden gasped again; \"there\u0027s three hundred and more young chaps and boys wi\u0027 sticks and stones joost awaiting on this side t\u0027village, awaiting to pay you all oot.\" Ejaculations of alarm were heard all round, and several of the girls began to whimper. \"Hush!\" Mr. Dodgson said, coming forward. \"Let all keep silence, there may be no occasion for alarm; let us hear all about it, Mrs. Haden.\" Mrs. Haden repeated her story, and said that Harry\u0027s father and mother were getting a body of pitmen to help them. \"I think, Mr. Dodgson,\" said Jack, \"the girls had best go back to Mr. Brook\u0027s as quickly as possible; we will come and fetch them when it\u0027s all over.\" \"I think so too,\" said Mr. Dodgson, \"they might be injured by stones. My dear, do you lead the girls back to Mr. Brook\u0027s. The house will hardly be shut up yet, and even if it is, Mr. Brook will gladly receive you. There is no chance of any of the ruffians pursuing them, do you think, Jack, when they find they have only us to deal with?\" \"I don\u0027t know, sir. If three or four of us were to put on their cloaks, something light to show in the dark, they will think the girls are among us.\" [Pg 188] \"Quick! here they come,\" Mr. Dodgson said, \"go back silently, girls, not a word.\" Two or three cloaks and shawls were hastily borrowed and the lads then turned up the road, where the sound of suppressed laughter and coarse oaths could be heard, while the young women went off at a rapid pace towards the hall. \"There are four of the clubs, nigh twenty in each,\" Jack said; \"let each club keep together and go right at \u0027em. Stick together whatever ye do.\" \"I\u0027ll take my place by you, Jack,\" Mr. Dodgson said; \"you are our captain now.\" Talking in a careless voice the party went forward. The road here was only divided from the fields on either side by a newly planted hedge of a foot or so in height. Jack had arranged that he, with the few married pitmen, Mr. Dodgson, and the eight Bull-dogs who did not belong to the other associations, should hold the road; that two of the other clubs should go on each side, fight their way as far as they could, and then close in on the road to take the assailants there on both flanks. The spirit of association did wonders; many of the lads were but fourteen or fifteen, yet all gathered under their respective leaders and prepared for what they felt would be a desperate struggle. Presently they saw a dark mass gathered in the road. As soon as the light shawls were seen there was a cry of \"Here they be, give it \u0027em well, lads;\" and a volley [Pg 189]of what were, in the majority of cases, clods of earth, but among which were many stones, was poured in. Without an instant\u0027s pause the party attacked separated, two bands leapt into the field on either side, and then the whole rushed at the assailants. No such charge as this had been anticipated. The cowardly ruffians had expected to give a complete surprise, to hear the shrieks of the girls, and perhaps some slight resistance from a few of the older lads; the suddenness of this attack astonished them. In an instant Jack and his supporters were in their midst, and the fury which animated them at this cowardly attack, and the unity of their action, bore all before them; and in spite of their sticks the leaders of the assailants were beaten to the ground. Then the sheer weight of the mass behind stopped the advance and the conflict became a general one. In the crowd and confusion it was difficult to distinguish friend from foe, and this prevented the assailants from making full use of their stakes, rails, and other implements with which they were armed. They were, however, getting the best of it, Mr. Dodgson had been knocked down with a heavy stake and several others were badly hurt, when the strong bands in the field who had driven back the scattered assailants there, fell upon the flanks of the main body in the road. For five minutes the fight was a desperate one, and then, just as numbers and weapons were telling, there was a shout in the rear, and fifteen pitmen, headed by [Pg 190]Jim Shepherd and armed with pick handles, as formidable weapons as could be desired in the hands of strong men, fell upon the rear of the assailants. Yells, shouts, and heavy crashing blows told the tale to those engaged in front; and at once the assailants broke and scattered in flight. \"Catch \u0027em and bring \u0027em down,\" Jack shouted; \"they shall pay for this night\u0027s work.\" Such of the lads as were not disabled started off, and being fleet of foot, those of the assailants nearest to them had little chance of escape. Two or three lads together sprung upon one and pulled him down, and so when the pursuit ended twenty-nine of the assailants had fallen into their hands. In addition to this a score of them lay or sat by the road with broken heads and bones, the work of the pitmen\u0027s weapons. Of the lads the greater part had been badly knocked about, and some lay insensible in the road. The prisoners were brought together, five of the pitmen with twenty of the lads marched with those able to walk, to the village, where they shut them up in the school-room. The other pitmen remained in charge of the wounded of both sides, and the rest of the party were sent back to Mr. Brook\u0027s to fetch the women and girls. Near the house they met Mr. Brook, accompanied by his two men-servants and gardener, armed with spades, hurrying forward; and he expressed his delight at the issue of the conflict, but shook his head at the number of serious injuries on both sides. [Pg 191] In a shed near the house were a number of hurdles, and twenty of these were at once sent forward with the men to carry those unable to walk into the village. Mrs. Dodgson turned pale as her husband, his face covered with blood, entered the dining-room, where, huddled together, the frightened girls were standing; Mrs. Dodgson, aided by Nelly Hardy, having done her utmost to allay their fears. \"I am not hurt,\" Mr. Dodgson said heartily, \"at least not seriously; but I fear that some are. It is all over now, and those ruffians have fled. Jack Simpson and a party are outside to escort you home. We don\u0027t know who are hurt yet, but they will be carried to the girls\u0027 school-room and attended there. Harry Shepherd has gone on to get the doctor up, and Mr. Brook is sending off a man on horseback to Birmingham for some more medical aid and a body of police to take charge of the fellows we have captured; they will be in by the early train.\" Everything was quiet in Stokebridge when the party with the prisoners arrived. The pitmen, before starting, had gone into the public-house to get any sober enough to walk to join them; and the few who had kept up the dancing, alarmed at the serious nature of the affair, of which they had tacitly approved, scattered to their homes. The news of the conflict, however, quickly circulated, lights appeared in windows, and the women who had sons or daughters at the fête flocked out into the streets to hear the news. Many other pitmen, whom there [Pg 192]had not been time enough to summon, soon joined them, and deep indeed was the wrath with which the news of the assault was received. Most of the men at once hurried away to the scene of conflict to see who were hurt, and to assist to carry them in; and the sole ground for satisfaction was that the women and girls had all escaped injury. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87030.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
