{"id":44102,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. PROGRESS.","content":"\"B less me, lad, another poond o\u0027 candles! I never did hear o\u0027 sich waste,\" Mrs. Haden exclaimed as Jack entered the cottage on a winter\u0027s afternoon, two years and a half after he had gone into the pit. \"Another poond o\u0027 candles, and it was only last Monday as you bought the last—nigh two candles a night. Thou wilt kill thyself sitting up reading o\u0027 nights, and thy eyes will sink i\u0027 thy head, and thou\u0027lt be as blind as a bat afore thou\u0027rt forty.\" \"I only read up to eleven, mother, that gives me six hours abed, and as thou know, six for a man, seven for a woman, is all that is needful; and as to the expense, as dad lets me keep all my earnings save five bob a week—and very good o\u0027 him it is; I doan\u0027t know no man in the pit as does as much—why, I ha\u0027 plenty o\u0027 money for my candles and books, and to lay by summat for a rainy day.\" \"Aye, aye, lad, I know thou be\u0027st not wasteful save in candles; it\u0027s thy health I thinks o\u0027.\" [Pg 75] \"Health!\" Jack laughed; \"why, there ain\u0027t a lad in the pit as strong as I am of my age, and I ha\u0027 never ailed a day yet, and doan\u0027t mean to.\" \"What ha\u0027 ye been doing all the arternoon, Jack?\" \"I ha\u0027 been sliding in the big pond wi\u0027 Harry Shepherd and a lot o\u0027 others. Then Dick Somers, he knocked down Harry\u0027s little sister Fan, as she came running across th\u0027 ice, and larfed out when she cried—a great brute—so I licked he till he couldn\u0027t see out o\u0027 his eyes.\" \"He\u0027s bigger nor thee, too,\" Mrs. Haden said admiringly. \"Aye, he\u0027s bigger,\" Jack said carelessly, \"but he ain\u0027t game, Dick ain\u0027t; loses his temper, he does, and a chap as does that when he\u0027s fighting ain\u0027t o\u0027 no account. But I must not stand a clappeting here; it\u0027s past six, and six is my time.\" \"Have your tea first, Jack, it\u0027s a\u0027 ready; but I do believe thou\u0027dst go wi\u0027out eating wi\u0027out noticing it, when thou\u0027st got thy books in thy head.\" Jack sat down and drank the tea his mother poured out for him, and devoured bread and butter with a zest that showed that his appetite was unimpaired by study. As soon as he had finished he caught up his candle, and with a nod to Mrs. Haden ran upstairs to his room. Jack Simpson\u0027s craze for learning, as it was regarded by the other lads of Stokebridge, was the subject of much joking and chaff among them. Had he been a [Pg 76]shy and retiring boy, holding himself aloof from the sports of his mates, ridicule would have taken the place of joking, and persecution of chaff. But Jack was so much one of themselves, a leader in their games, a good fellow all round, equally ready to play or to fight, that the fact that after six o\u0027clock he shut himself up in his room and studied, was regarded as something in the nature of a humorous joke. When he had first begun, his comrades all predicted that the fit would not last, and that a few weeks would see the end of it; but weeks and months and years had gone by, and Jack kept on steadily at the work he had set himself to do. Amusement had long died away, and there grew up an unspoken respect for their comrade. \"He be a rum \u0027un, be Jack,\" they would say; \"he looves games, and can lick any chap his age anywhere round, and yet he shoots himself oop and reads and reads hours and hours every day, and he knows a heap, Bull-dog does.\" Not that Jack was in the habit of parading his acquirements; indeed he took the greatest pains to conceal them and to show that in no respect did he differ from his playfellows. The two hours which he now spent twice a week with Mr. Merton, and his extensive reading, had modified his rough Staffordshire dialect, and when with his master he spoke correct English almost free of provincialisms, although with his comrades of the pit he spoke as they spoke, and never introduced any allusion to his [Pg 77]studies. All questions as to his object in spending his evenings with his books were turned aside with joking answers, but his comrades had accidentally discovered that he possessed extraordinary powers of calculation. One of the lads had vaguely said that he wondered how many buckets of water there were in the canal between Stokebridge and Birmingham, a distance of eighteen miles, and Jack, without seeming to think of what he was doing, almost instantaneously gave the answer to the question. For a moment all were silent with surprise. \"I suppose that be a guess, Jack, eh?\" Fred Orme asked. \"Noa,\" Jack said, \"that\u0027s aboot roight, though I be sorry I said it; I joost reckoned it in my head.\" \"But how didst do that, Jack?\" his questioner asked, astonished, while the boys standing round stared in silent wonder. \"Oh! in my head,\" Jack said carelessly; \"it be easy enough to reckon in your head if you practise a little.\" \"And canst do any sum in thy head, Jack, as quick as that?\" \"Not any sum, but anything easy, say up to the multiplication or division by eight figures.\" \"Let\u0027s try him,\" one boy said. \"All right, try away,\" Jack said. \"Do it first on a bit of paper, and then ask me.\" The boys drew off in a body, and a sum was fixed upon and worked out with a great deal of discussion. [Pg 78] At last, after a quarter of an hour\u0027s work, when all had gone through it and agreed that it was correct, they returned and said to him, \"Multiply 324,683 by 459,852.\" Jack thought for a few seconds and then taking the pencil and paper wrote down the answer: 149,306,126,916. \"Why, Jack, thou be\u0027est a conjurer,\" one exclaimed, while the others broke out into a shout of astonishment. From that time it became an acknowledged fact that Jack Simpson was a wonder, and that there was some use in studying after all; and after their games were over they would sit round and ask him questions which they had laboriously prepared, and the speed and accuracy of his answers were a never-failing source of wonder to them. As to his other studies they never inquired; it was enough for them that he could do this, and the fact that he could do it made them proud of him in a way, and when put upon by the pitmen it became a common retort among them, \"Don\u0027t thou talk, there\u0027s Jack Simpson, he knows as much as thee and thy mates put together. Why, he can do a soom as long as a slaate as quick as thou\u0027d ask it.\" Jack himself laughed at his calculating powers, and told the boys that they could do the same if they would practise, believing what he said; but in point of fact this was not so, for the lad had an extraordinary natural faculty for calculation, and his schoolmaster [Pg 79]was often astonished by the rapidity with which he could prepare in his brain long and complex calculations, and that in a space of time little beyond that which it would take to write the question upon paper. So abnormal altogether was his power in this respect that Mr. Merton begged him to discontinue the practice of difficult calculation when at work. \"It is a bad thing, Jack, to give undue prominence to one description of mental labour, and I fear that you will injure your brain if you are always exercising it in one direction. Therefore when in the pit think over other subjects, history, geography, what you will, but leave calculations alone except when you have your books before you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87019.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
