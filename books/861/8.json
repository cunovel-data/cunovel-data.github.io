{"id":44101,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII. FRIENDSHIP.","content":"N elly Hardy had been unfortunate in her parents, for both drank, and she had grown up without care or supervision. She had neither brother nor sister. At school she was always either at the top or bottom of her class according as a fit of diligence or idleness seized her. She was a wild passionate child, feeling bitterly the neglect with which she was treated, her ragged clothes, her unkempt appearance. She was feared and yet liked by the girls of her own age, for she was generous, always ready to do a service, and good-tempered except when excited to passion. She was fonder of joining with the boys, when they would let her, in their games, and, when angered, was ready to hold her own against them with tooth and nail. So wild were her bursts of passion that they were sources of amusement to some of the boys, until Jack upon one occasion took her part, and fought and conquered the boy who had excited her. This was on the Saturday before the accident had taken place. [Pg 65] For some days after the presentation no one saw her; she kept herself shut up in the house or wandered far away. Then she appeared suddenly before Jack Simpson and Harry Shepherd as they were out together. \"I hate you, Jack Simpson,\" she said, \"I hate you, I hate you;\" and then dashed through the gap in the hedge by which she had come. \"Well,\" Harry exclaimed in astonishment, \"only to think!\" \"It be nat\u0027ral enough,\" Jack said, \"and I bain\u0027t surprised one bit. I orter ha\u0027 known better. I had only to ha\u0027 joodged her by myself and I should ha\u0027 seen it. I hated being dragged forward and talked at; it was bad enough though I had been made decent and clean scrubbed all over, and got my Soonday clothes on, but of course it would be worse for a lass anyway, and she was all anyhow, not expecting it. I ought to ha\u0027 known better; I thawt only o\u0027 my own feelings and not o\u0027 hers, and I\u0027d beg her pardon a hundred times, but \u0027taint likely she\u0027d forgive me. What is she a doing now?\" The lads peered through the hedge. Far across the field, on the bank, the other side, lay what looked like a bundle of clothes. \"She be a crying, I expect,\" Jack said remorsefully. \"I do wish some big chap would a come along and give I a hiding; I wouldn\u0027t fight, or kick, or do nowt, I would just take it, it would serve me roight. I [Pg 66]wonder whether it would do her any good to let her thrash me. If it would she\u0027d be welcome. Look here, Harry, she bain\u0027t angry wi\u0027 you. Do thou go across to her and tell her how main sorry I be, and that I know I am a selfish brute and thought o\u0027 myself and not o\u0027 her, and say that if she likes I will cut her a stick any size she likes and let her welt me just as long as she likes wi\u0027out saying a word.\" Harry was rather loath to go on such an errand, but being imperatively ordered by Jack he, as usual, did as his comrade wished. When he approached Nelly Hardy he saw that the girl was crying bitterly, her sobs shaking her whole body. \"I be coom wi\u0027 a message,\" he began in a tone of apprehension, for he regarded Nelly as resembling a wild cat in her dangerous and unexpected attacks. The girl leapt to her feet and turned her flushed tear-stained cheeks and eyes, flashing with anger through the tears, upon him. \"What dost want, Harry Shepherd? Get thee gone, or I\u0027ll tear the eyes from thy head.\" \"I doan\u0027t coom o\u0027 my own accord,\" Harry said steadily, though he recoiled a little before her fierce outburst. \"I came on the part o\u0027 Jack Simpson, and I\u0027ve got to gi\u0027 you his message even if you do fly at me. I\u0027ve got to tell you that he be main sorry, and that he feels he were a selfish brute in a thinking o\u0027 his own feelings instead o\u0027 thine. He says he be so sorry that if \u0027ee like he\u0027ll cut a stick o\u0027 any size you choose [Pg 67]and ull let you welt him as long as you like wi\u0027out saying a word. And when Jack says a thing he means it, so if you wants to wop him, come on.\" To Harry\u0027s intense surprise the girl\u0027s mood changed. She dropped on the ground again, and again began to cry. After standing still for some time and seeing no abatement in her sobs, or any sign of her carrying out the invitation of which he had been the bearer, Jack\u0027s emissary returned to him. \"I guv her your message, Jack, and she said nowt, but there she be a crying still.\" \"Perhaps she didn\u0027t believe you,\" Jack said; \"I\u0027d best go myself.\" First, with great deliberation, Jack chose a hazel stick from the hedge and tried it critically. When fully assured that it was at once lissom and tough, and admirably adapted for his purpose, he told Harry to go on home. \"Maybe,\" Jack said, \"she mayn\u0027t loike to use it and you a looking on. Doan\u0027t \u0027ee say a word to no un. If she likes to boast as she ha\u0027 welted me she ha\u0027 a roight to do so, but doan\u0027t you say nowt.\" Jack walked slowly across the field till he was close to the figure on the ground. Then he quietly removed his jacket and waistcoat and laid them down. Then he said: \"Now, Nelly, I be ready for a welting, I ha\u0027 deserved it if ever a chap did, and I\u0027ll take it. Here\u0027s [Pg 68]the stick, and he\u0027s a good un and will sting rare, I warrant.\" The girl sat up and looked at him through her tears. \"Oh, Jack, and didst really think I wanted to welt thee?\" \"I didn\u0027t know whether thou didst or no, Nelly, but thou said thou hate\u0027st me, and wi\u0027 good reason, so if thou likest to welt me here\u0027s the stick.\" The girl laughed through her tears. \"Ah! Jack, thou must think that I am a wild cat, as John Dobson called me t\u0027other day. Throw away that stick, Jack. I would rather a thousand times that thou laidst it on my shoulders than I on thine.\" Jack threw away the stick, put on his coat and waistcoat, and sat down on the bank. \"What is it then, lass? I know I were cruel to have thee called forward, but I didn\u0027t think o\u0027t; but I had rather that thou beat me as I orter be beaten, than that thou should go on hating me.\" \"I doan\u0027t hate thee, Jack, though I said so; I hate myself; but I like thee better nor all, thou art so brave and good.\" \"No braver than thou, Nelly,\" Jack said earnestly; \"I doan\u0027t understand why thou should first say thou hates me and then that thou doan\u0027t; but if thou are in earnest, that thou likest me, we\u0027ll be friends. I don\u0027t mean that we go for walks together, and such like, as some boys and girls do, for I ha\u0027 no time for such things, and I shouldn\u0027t like it even if I had; but I\u0027ll [Pg 69]take thy part if anyone says owt to thee, and thou shalt tell me when thou art very bad at hoam\"—for the failings of Nelly\u0027s parents were public property. \"Thou shalt be a friend to me, not as a lass would be, but as Harry is, and thou woan\u0027t mind if I blow thee up, and tells \u0027ee of things. Thou stook to me by the side o\u0027 the shaft, and I\u0027ll stick to thee.\" \"I\u0027ll do that,\" the girl said, laying her hand in his. \"I\u0027ll be thy friend if thou\u0027lt let me, not as lasses are, but as lads.\" And so the friendship was ratified, and they walked back together to the village. When he came to think it over, Jack was inclined to repent his bargain, for he feared that she would attach herself to him, and that he would have much laughter to endure, and many battles to fight. To his surprise Nelly did nothing of the sort. She would be at her door every morning as he went by to the pit and give him a nod, and again as he returned. Whenever other girls and boys were playing or sitting together, Nelly would make one of the group. If he said, as he often did say, \"You, Nell Hardy come and sit by me,\" she came gladly, but she never claimed the place. She was ready to come or to go, to run messages and to do him good in any way. Jack had promised she should be his friend as Harry was, and as he got to like her more he would ask her or tell her to accompany them in their walks, or to sit on a low wall in some quiet corner and talk. [Pg 70]Harry, stirred by his friend\u0027s example, had begun to spend half an hour a day over his old school-books. \"Why dost like larning so much, Jack?\" Nelly asked, as Jack was severely reproaching his friend with not having looked at a book for some days; \"what good do it do?\" \"It raises folk in the world, Nell, helps \u0027em make their way up.\" \"And dost thou mean to get oop i\u0027 the world?\" \"Ay, lass,\" Jack said, \"if hard work can do it, I will; but it does more nor that. If a man knows things and loves reading it makes him different like, he\u0027s got summat to think about and talk about and care for beside public-houses and dorgs. Canst read, Nell?\" \"No, Jack,\" she said, colouring. \"It bain\u0027t my fault; mother never had the pence to spare for schooling, and I was kept at hoam to help.\" Jack sat thoughtful for some time. \"Wouldst like to learn?\" \"Ay.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll teach thee.\" \"Oh, Jack!\" and she leapt up with flashing eyes; \"how good thou be\u0027est!\" \"Doan\u0027t,\" Jack said crossly; \"what be there good in teaching a lass to spell? There\u0027s twopence, run down to the corner shop and buy a spelling-book; we\u0027ll begin at once.\" And so Nelly had her first lesson. NELLY\u0027S FIRST LESSON. NELLY\u0027S FIRST LESSON. [Pg 71]After that, every afternoon, as Jack came home from work, the girl would meet him in a quiet corner off the general line, and for five minutes he would teach her, not hearing her say what she had learned, but telling her fresh sounds and combinations of letters. Five or six times he would go over them, and expected—for Jack was tyrannical in his ways—that she would carry them away with her and learn them by heart, and go through them again and again, so that when he questioned her during their longer talks she would be perfect. Then, the five minutes over, Jack would run on to make up for lost time, and be in as soon as Bill Haden. But however accurately Jack expected his pupil to learn, his expectations were surpassed. The girl beyond clearing up the room had nothing to do, and she devoted herself with enthusiasm to this work. Once she had mastered simple words and felt her own progress, her shyness as to her ignorance left her. She always carried her book in her pocket, and took to asking girls the pronunciation of larger words, and begging them to read a few lines to her; and sitting on the door-step poring over her book, she would salute any passer-by with: \"Please tell us what is that word.\" When she could read easily, which she learned to do in two or three months, she borrowed left-off school-books from the girls, and worked slowly on, and two years later had made up for all her early [Pg 72]deficiencies, and knew as much as any of those who had passed through the school. From the day of her compact of friendship with Jack her appearance and demeanour had been gradually changing. From the first her wild unkempt hair had been smoothly combed and braided, though none but herself knew what hours of pain and trouble it took her with a bit of a comb with three teeth alone remaining, to reduce the tangled mass of hair to order. Her companions stared indeed with wonder on the first afternoon, when, thus transformed and with clean face, she came among them, with a new feeling of shyness. \"Why, it be Nelly Hardy!\" \"Why, Nell, what ha\u0027 done to t\u0027yself? I shouldn\u0027t ha\u0027 known ye.\" \"Well, ye be cleaned up surely.\" The girl was half inclined to flame out at their greetings, but she knew that the surprise was natural, and laughed good-humouredly. She was rewarded for her pains when Jack and some other boys, passing on their way to play, Jack stopped a moment and said to her quietly, \"Well done, lass, thou lookst rarely, who\u0027d ha\u0027 thought thou wert so comely!\" As time went on Nelly Hardy grew altogether out of her old self. Sometimes, indeed, bursts of temper, such as those which had gained her the name of the \"Wild Cat,\" would flare out, but these were very rare now. She was still very poorly dressed, for her house [Pg 73]was as wretched as of old, but there was an attempt at tidiness. Her manner, too, was softer, and it became more and more quiet as things went on, and her playmates wondered again and again what had come over Nell Hardy; she had got to be as quiet as a mouse. The boys at first were disposed to joke Jack upon this strange friendship, but Jack soon let it be understood that upon that subject joking was unacceptable. \"She stood by me,\" he said, \"and I\u0027m a-going to stand by her. She ain\u0027t got no friends, and I\u0027m going to be her friend. She\u0027s quiet enough and doan\u0027t bother, no more nor if she were a dorg. She doan\u0027t get in no one\u0027s way, she doan\u0027t want to play, and sits quiet and looks on, so if any of you doan\u0027t like her near ye, you can go away to t\u0027 other side o\u0027 field. I wish she\u0027d been a boy, \u0027twould ha\u0027 been fitter all ways, but she can\u0027t help that. She\u0027s got the sense o\u0027 one. and the pluck, and I like her. There!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87018.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
