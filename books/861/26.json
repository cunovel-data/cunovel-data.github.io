{"id":44119,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. THE IMPRISONED MINERS.","content":"T here was a mighty roar—a thundering sound, as of an express train—a blinding light, and a scorching heat. Jack felt himself lifted from the ground by the force of the blast, and dashed down again. Then he knew it was over, and staggered to his feet. The force of the explosion had passed along the main road, and so up the shaft, and he owed his life to the fact that he had been in the road off the course. He returned into the main road, but near the bottom of the shaft he was brought to a standstill. The roof had fallen, and the passage was blocked with fragments of rock and broken waggons. He knew that the bottom of the shaft must be partly filled up, that his comrades were killed, and that there was no hope of escape in that direction. For a moment he paused to consider; then, turning up the side road to the left, he ran at full speed from the shaft. He knew that the danger now was not so much from the fire-damp—the explosive gas—as from the even more dreaded choke-damp, which [Pg 240]surely follows after an explosion and the cessation of ventilation. Many more miners are killed by this choke-damp, as they hasten to the bottom of the shaft after an explosion, than by the fire itself. Choke-damp, which is carbonic acid gas, is heavier than ordinary air, and thus the lowest parts of a colliery become first filled with it, as they would with water. In all coal-mines there is a slight, sometimes a considerable, inclination, or \"dip\" as it is called, of the otherwise flat bed of coal. The shaft is almost always sunk at the lower end of the area owned by the proprietors of the mine, as by this means the whole pit naturally drains to the \"sump,\" or well, at the bottom of the shaft, whence it is pumped up by the engine above; the loaded waggons, too, are run down from the workings to the bottom of the shaft with comparative ease. The explosion had, as Jack well knew, destroyed all the doors which direct the currents of the air, and the ventilation had entirely ceased. The lower part of the mine, where the explosion had been strongest, would soon be filled with choke-damp, the product of the explosion, and Jack was making for the old workings, near the upper boundary line of the pit. There the air would remain pure long after it had been vitiated elsewhere. It was in this quarter of the mine that Bill Haden and some twenty other colliers worked. Presently Jack saw lights ahead, and heard a clatter[Pg 241]ing of steps. It was clear that, as he had hoped, the miners working there had escaped the force of the explosion, which had, without doubt, played awful havoc in the parts of the mine where the greater part of the men were at work. \"Stop! stop!\" Jack shouted, as they came up to him. \"Is it fire, Jack?\" Bill Haden, who was one of the first, asked. \"Yes, Bill; didn\u0027t you feel it?\" \"Some of us thought we felt a suck of air a quarter hour since, but we weren\u0027t sure; and then came another, which blew out the lights. Come along, lad; there is no time for talking.\" \"It\u0027s of no use going on,\" Jack said; \"the shaft\u0027s choked up. I came down after the first blow, and I fear there\u0027s no living soul in the new workings. By this time they must be full of the choke-damp.\" The men looked at each other with blank faces. \"Hast seen Brook?\" Jack asked eagerly. \"Ay, he passed our stall with Johnstone ten minutes ago, just before the blast came.\" \"We may catch him in time to stop him yet,\" Jack said, \"if he has gone round to look at the walling of the old goafs. There are three men at work there.\" \"I\u0027ll go with you, Jack,\" Bill Haden said. \"Our best place is my stall, lads,\" he went on, turning to the others; \"that is pretty well the highest ground in the pit, and the air will keep good there as long as [Pg 242]anywhere—may be till help comes. You come along of us, mate,\" he said, turning to the man who worked with him in his stall. As they hurried along, Jack, in a few words, told what had taken place, as far as he knew it. Five minutes\u0027 run brought them to the place where the masons were at work walling up the entrance to some old workings. They looked astonished at the new-comers. \"Have you seen the gaffers?\" \"Ay, they ha\u0027 just gone on. There, don\u0027t you see their lights down the heading? No; well I saw \u0027em a moment since.\" \"Come along,\" Jack said. \"Quick! I expect they\u0027ve met it.\" At full speed they hurried along. Presently they all stopped short; the lights burnt low, and a choking sensation came on them. \"Back, Jack, for your life!\" gasped Bill Haden; but at that moment Jack\u0027s feet struck something, which he knew was a body. \"Down at my feet; help!\" he cried. He stooped and tried to raise the body. Then the last gleam of his light went out—his lungs seemed to cease acting, and he saw no more. When he came to himself again he was being carried on Bill Haden\u0027s shoulder. \"All right, dad,\" he said. \"I am coming round now; put me down.\" [Pg 243] \"That\u0027s a good job, Jack. I thought thou\u0027d\u0027st scarce come round again.\" \"Have you got either of the others?\" \"We\u0027ve got Brook; you\u0027d your arm round him so tight that Ned and I lifted you together. He\u0027s on ahead; the masons are carrying him, and Ned\u0027s showing the way. Canst walk now?\" \"Yes, I\u0027m better now. How did you manage to breathe, dad?\" \"We didn\u0027t breathe, Jack; we\u0027re too old hands for that. When we saw you fall we just drew back, took a breath, and then shut our mouths, and went down for you just the same as if we\u0027d been a groping for you under water. We got hold of you both, lifted you up, and carried you along as far as we could before we drew a breath again. You\u0027re sharp, Jack, but you don\u0027t know everything yet.\" And Bill Haden chuckled to find that for once his practical experience taught him something that Jack had not learned from his books. Jack now hurried along after Bill Haden, and in a few minutes reached the place fixed upon. Here the miners were engaged in restoring consciousness to Mr. Brook, who, under the influence of water dashed on his face and artificial respiration set up by alternately pressing upon the chest and allowing it to rise again, was just beginning to show signs of life. Their interest in their employment was so great that it was not until Mr. Brook was able to sit up that they began to talk about the future. [Pg 244] Jack\u0027s account of the state of things near the shaft was listened to gravely. The fact that the whole of the system of ventilation had been deranged, and the proof given by the second explosion that the mine was somewhere on fire, needed no comment to these experienced men. It sounded their death-knell. Gallant and unceasing as would be the efforts made under any other circumstance to rescue them, the fact that the pit was on fire, and that fresh explosions might at any moment take place, would render it an act of simple madness for their friends above to endeavour to clear the shaft and headings, and to restore the ventilation. The fact was further impressed upon them by a sudden and simultaneous flicker of the lamps, and a faint shake, followed by a distant rumble. \"Another blast,\" Bill Haden said. \"That settles us, lads. We may as well turn out all the lamps but two, so as to have light as long as we last out.\" \"Is there no hope?\" Mr. Brook asked presently, coming forward after he had heard from Haden\u0027s mate the manner in which he had been so far saved. \"Not a scrap, master,\" said Bill Haden. \"We are like rats in a trap; and it would ha\u0027 been kinder of us if we\u0027d a let you lay as you was.\" \"Your intention was equally kind,\" Mr. Brook said. \"But is there nothing that we can do?\" \"Nowt,\" Bill Haden said. \"We have got our dinners wi\u0027 us, and might make \u0027em last, a mouthful at a time, to keep life in us for a week or more. But what \u0027ud be [Pg 245]th\u0027 use of it? It may be weeks—ay, or months—before they can stifle the fire and make their way here.\" \"Can you suggest nothing, Jack?\" Mr. Brook asked. \"You are the only officer of the pit left now,\" he added with a faint smile. Jack had not spoken since he reached the stall, but had sat down on a block of coal, with his elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands—a favourite attitude of his when thinking deeply. The other colliers had thrown themselves down on the ground; some sobbed occasionally as they thought of their loved ones above, some lay in silence. Jack answered the appeal by rising to his feet. \"Yes, sir, I think we may do something.\" The men raised themselves in surprise. \"In the first place, sir, I should send men in each direction to see how near the choke-damp has got. There are four roads by which it could come up. I would shut the doors on this side of the place it has got to, roll blocks of coal and rubbish to keep \u0027em tight, and stop up the chinks with wet mud. That will keep the gas from coming up, and there is air enough in the stalls and headings to last us a long time.\" \"But that would only prolong our lives for a few hours, Jack, and I don\u0027t know that that would be any advantage. Better to be choked by the gas than to die of starvation,\" Mr. Brook said, and a murmur from the men showed that they agreed with him. \"I vote for lighting our pipes,\" one of the miners [Pg 246]said. \"If there is fiery gas here, it would be better to finish with it at once.\" There was a general expression of approval. \"Wait!\" Jack said authoritatively; \"wait till I have done. You know, Mr. Brook, we are close to our north boundary here, in some places within a very few yards. Now the \u0027Logan,\u0027 which lies next to us, has been worked out years ago. Of course it is full of water, and it was from fear of tapping that water that the works were stopped here. A good deal comes in through the crevices in No. 15 stall, which I expect is nearest to it. Now if we could work into the \u0027Logan,\u0027 the water would rush down into our workings, and as our pit is a good deal bigger than the \u0027Logan\u0027 ever was it will fill the lower workings and put out the fire, but won\u0027t reach here. Then we can get up through the \u0027Logan,\u0027 where the air is sure to be all right, as the water will bring good air down with it. We may not do it in time, but it is a chance. What do you say, sir?\" \"It is worth trying, at any rate,\" Mr. Brook said. \"Bravo, my lad! your clear head may save us yet.\" \"By gum, Jack! but you\u0027re a good un!\" Bill Haden said, bringing down his hand upon Jack\u0027s shoulder with a force that almost knocked him down; while the men, with revived hope, leaped to their feet, and crowding round, shook Jack\u0027s hands with exclamations of approval and delight. \"Now, lads,\" Mr. Brook said, \"Jack Simpson is [Pg 247]master now, and we will all work under his orders. But before we begin, boys, let us say a prayer. We are in God\u0027s hands; let us ask his protection.\" Every head was bared, and the men stood reverently while, in a few words, Mr. Brook prayed for strength and protection, and rescue from their danger. \"Now, Jack,\" he said, when he had finished, \"give your orders.\" Jack at once sent off two men along each of the roads to find how near the choke-damp had approached, and to block up and seal the doors. It was necessary to strike a light to relight some of the lamps, but this was a danger that could not be avoided. The rest of the men were sent round to all the places where work had been going on to bring in the tools and dinners to No. 15 stall, to which Jack himself, Bill Haden, and Mr. Brook proceeded at once. No work had been done there for years. The floor was covered with a black mud, and a close examination of the face showed tiny streamlets of water trickling down in several places. An examination of the stalls, or working places, on either side, showed similar appearances, but in a less marked degree. It was therefore determined to begin work in No. 15. \"You don\u0027t mean to use powder, Jack?\" Bill Haden asked. \"No, dad; without any ventilation we should be choked with the smoke, and there would be the danger from the gas. When we think we are getting near [Pg 248]the water we will put in a big shot, so as to blow in the face.\" When the men returned with the tools and the dinners, the latter done up in handkerchiefs, Jack asked Mr. Brook to take charge of the food. \"There are just twenty of us, sir, without you, and nineteen dinners. So if you divide among us four dinners a day, it will last for five days, and by that time I hope we shall be free.\" Four men only could work at the face of the stall together, and Jack divided the twenty into five sets. \"We will work in quarter-of-an-hour shifts at first,\" he said; \"that will give an hour\u0027s rest to a quarter of an hour\u0027s work, and a man can work well, we know, for a quarter of an hour. When we get done up, we will have half-hour shifts, which will give two hours for a sleep in between.\" The men of the first shift, stripped as usual to the waist, set to work without an instant\u0027s delay; and the vigour and swiftness with which the blows fell upon the face of the rock would have told experienced miners that the men who struck them were working for life or death. Those unemployed, Jack took into the adjacent stalls and set them to work to clear a narrow strip of the floor next to the upper wall, then to cut a little groove in the rocky floor to intercept the water as it slowly trickled in, and lead it to small hollows which they were to make in the solid rock. The water coming through the two stalls would, thus collected, be ample for their [Pg 249]wants. Jack then started to see how the men at work at the doors were getting on. These had already nearly finished their tasks. On the road leading to the main workings choke-damp had been met with at a distance of fifty yards from the stall; but upon the upper road it was several hundred yards before it was found. On the other two roads it was over a hundred yards. The men had torn strips off their flannel jackets and had thrust them into the crevices of the doors, and had then plastered mud from the roadway on thickly, and there was no reason to fear any irruption of choke-damp, unless, indeed, an explosion should take place so violent as to blow in the doors. This, however, was unlikely, as, with a fire burning, the gas would ignite as it came out; and although there might be many minor explosions, there would scarcely be one so serious as the first two which had taken place. The work at the doors and the water being over, the men all gathered in the stall. Then Jack insisted on an equal division of the tobacco, of which almost all the miners possessed some—for colliers, forbidden to smoke, often chew tobacco, and the tobacco might therefore be regarded both as a luxury, and as being very valuable in assisting the men to keep down the pangs of hunger. This had to be divided only into twenty shares, as Mr. Brook said that he could not use it in that way, and that he had, moreover, a couple of cigars in his pocket, which he could suck if hard driven to it. Now that they were together again, all the lamps [Pg 250]were extinguished save the two required by the men employed. With work to be done, and a hope of ultimate release, the men\u0027s spirits rose, and between their spells they talked, and now and then even a laugh was heard. Mr. Brook, although unable to do a share of the work, was very valuable in aiding to keep up their spirits, by his hopeful talk, and by anecdotes of people who had been in great danger in many ways in different parts of the world, but who had finally escaped. Sometimes one or other of the men would propose a hymn—for among miners, as among sailors, there is at heart a deep religious feeling, consequent upon a life which may at any moment be cut short—and then their deep voices would rise together, while the blows of the sledges and picks would keep time to the swing of the tune. On the advice of Mr. Brook the men divided their portions of food, small as they were, into two parts, to be eaten twelve hours apart; for as the work would proceed without interruption night and day, it was better to eat, however little, every twelve hours, than to go twenty-four without food. The first twenty-four hours over, the stall—or rather the heading, for it was now driven as narrow as it was possible for four men to work simultaneously—had greatly advanced; indeed it would have been difficult even for a miner to believe that so much work had been done in the time. There was, however, no change in the appearances; the water still trickled in, but they could [Pg 251]not perceive that it came faster than before. As fast as the coal fell—for fortunately the seam was over four feet thick, so that they did not have to work upon the rock—it was removed by the set of men who were next for work, so that there was not a minute lost from this cause. During the next twenty-four hours almost as much work was done as during the first; but upon the third there was a decided falling off. The scanty food was telling upon them now. The shifts were lengthened to an hour to allow longer time for sleep between each spell of work, and each set of men, when relieved, threw themselves down exhausted, and slept for three hours, until it was their turn to wake up and remove the coal as the set at work got it down. At the end of seventy-two hours the water was coming through the face much faster than at first, and the old miners, accustomed to judge by sound, were of opinion that the wall in front sounded less solid, and that they were approaching the old workings of the Logan pit. In the three days and nights they had driven the heading nearly fifteen yards from the point where they had begun. Upon the fourth day they worked cautiously, driving a borer three feet ahead of them into the coal, as in case of the water bursting through suddenly they would be all drowned. At the end of ninety hours from the time of striking the first blow the drill which, Jack holding it, Bill Haden was just driving in deeper with a sledge, sud[Pg 252]denly went forward, and as suddenly flew out as if shot from a gun, followed by a jet of water driven with tremendous force. A plug, which had been prepared in readiness, was with difficulty driven into the hole; two men who had been knocked down by the force of the water were picked up, much bruised and hurt; and with thankful hearts that the end of their labour was at hand all prepared for the last and most critical portion of their task. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87036.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
