{"id":44104,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X. HARD TIMES.","content":"I t was when the pinch came, the subscriptions fell off, and the weekly payments by the union dwindled to a few shillings for the support of a whole family, that the rough virtues of the people of the mining districts came strongly into prominence. Starvation was doing its work, and told first upon the women and children. Little faces, awhile since so rosy and bright, grew thin and pinched, chubby arms shrank until the bone could almost be seen through the skin, and low fever, a sure accompaniment of want, made its appearance. No more tender and devoted nurses could be found than the rough women, who hushed their voices, and stole with quiet feet around the little beds, letting fall many a silent tear when the sufferer asked for little things, for tea or lemonade, which there were no means to purchase, or when the doctor shook his head and said that good food and not medicine was needed. The pitmen themselves would saunter aimlessly in and out of the houses, so changed from the cottages well [Pg 97]stocked with furniture, with gay-coloured pictures on the wall, an eight-day clock, and many another little valuable, and all gone one after another. Very many of them lived upon the scantiest allowance of dry bread which would keep life together, in order that the allowance might all go for the children, retaining as their sole luxury a penny or two a week for the purchase of a pipe or two of tobacco daily. Had it not been for the soup-kitchen scores of children would have died, but the pint of soup and the slice of bread enabled them to live. There was no talk of surrender yet, although compromises, which would at first have been indignantly rejected, were now discussed, and a deputation had waited upon Mr. Brook, but the owner refused to enter into any compromise. \"No, never,\" he said; \"you have chosen to join the hands of the other pits in an endeavour to force your employers into giving you a higher rate of wages than they can afford to pay. I, therefore, have joined the other employers. We know, what you cannot know, what are our expenses, and what we can afford to pay, and we will accept no dictation whatever from the men as to their rate of wages. If I prefer, as I do prefer, that the colliery should stand idle, to raising your rate of wages, it is a clear proof that I should lose money if I agreed to your demand. If needs be I would rather that the pit was closed for a year, or for ten years. We have bound ourselves together to make [Pg 98]no advance, just as you have bound yourselves not to go to work at the old rate. When you choose to go in at that rate there are your places ready for you, but I will give way in no single point, I will not pay a halfpenny a ton more than before. You best know how long you can hold out. Don\u0027t let it be too long, lads, for the sake of your wives and children; remember that the time may come, when, thinking over some empty chair, recalling some little face you will never see again, you will curse your folly and obstinacy in ruining your homes, and destroying those dependent upon you in a struggle in which it was from the first certain that you could not win, and in which, even if you won, the amount at stake is not worth one day of the suffering which you are inflicting upon those you love.\" Left to themselves the men would have much sooner given in, would indeed never have embarked on the strike, but the influence of the union being over them, they feared to be called \"black sheep,\" and to be taunted with deserting the general cause, and so the strike went on. The tale of the suffering over the wide district affected by the strike was told through the land, and the subscriptions of the benevolent flowed in. Public opinion was, however, strongly opposed to the strike, and for the most part the money was subscribed wholly for soup-kitchen, for children, and for relief of the sick. But the area was wide, there were scores of villages [Pg 99]as badly off as Stokebridge, and the share of each of the general fund was very small. A local committee was formed, of which the vicar was at the head, for the management of the funds, and for organizing a body of nurses. All the women who had no children of their own were enrolled upon its lists, and many of the girls of the sewing-class volunteered their services. No one during this sad time devoted herself more untiringly and devotedly than Nelly Hardy. The quiet manner, the steady and resolute face, rendered her an excellent nurse, and as her father and mother were, perforce, sober, she could devote her whole time to the work. A portion of the funds was devoted to the preparation of the articles of food and drink necessary for the sick, and the kitchen of the schoolroom was freely employed in making milk-puddings, barley-water, and other things which brought pleasure and alleviation to the parched little lips for which they were intended. The distress grew daily more intense. The small traders could no longer give credit; the pawnbrokers were so overburdened with household goods that they were obliged absolutely to decline to receive more; the doctors were worn out with work; the guardians of the poor were nearly beside themselves in their efforts to face the frightful distress prevailing; and the charitable committee, aided as they were by subscriptions from without, could still do but little in comparison to the great need. Jane Haden and the other women [Pg 100]without families, did their best to help nurse in the houses where sickness was rife. The children were mere shadows, and the men and women, although far less reduced, were yet worn and wasted by want of food. And still the strike went on, still the men held out against the reduction. Some of the masters had brought men from other parts, and these had to be guarded to and from their work by strong bodies of police, and several serious encounters had taken place. Some of the hands were wavering now, but the party of resistance grew more and more violent, and the waverers dared not raise their voices. The delegates of the union went about holding meetings, and assuring their hearers that the masters were on the point of being beaten, and must give way; but they were listened to in sullen and gloomy silence by the men. Then came muttered threats and secret gatherings; and then Jane Haden, obedient to her promise, but very doubtful as to its wisdom, posted the letter Jack had left with her. It was three o\u0027clock next day before he arrived, for he had not received the letter until he went out for his breakfast, and he had to go back to his work and ask to be allowed to go away for the afternoon on particular business, for which he was wanted at home. \"Well, mother, what is it?\" was his first question on entering. \"I oughtn\u0027t to tell \u0027ee, Jack; and I do believe Bill would kill me if he knew.\" [Pg 101] \"He won\u0027t know, mother, and you must tell me,\" Jack said quietly. \"Well, my boy, yesterday afternoon Bill came in here with eight or ten others. I were upstairs, but I suppose they thought I were out, and as I did not want to disturb \u0027em, and was pretty nigh worn out—I had been up three nights with Betsy Mullin\u0027s girl—I sat down and nigh dozed off. The door was open, and I could hear what they said downstairs when they spoke loud. At first they talked low, and I didn\u0027t heed what they were saying; then I heard a word or two which frighted me, and then I got up and went quiet to my door and listened. Jack, they are going to wreck the engines, so as to stop the pumping and drown the mines. They are going to do for the \u0027Vaughan,\u0027 and the \u0027Hill Side,\u0027 and \u0027Thorns,\u0027 and the \u0027Little Shaft,\u0027 and \u0027Vale.\u0027 It\u0027s to be done to-night, and they begin with the \u0027Vaughan\u0027 at ten o\u0027clock, \u0027cause it\u0027s closest, I suppose.\" \"They are mad,\" Jack said sternly. \"How are they to earn bread if they flood the mines? and it will end by a lot of them being sent to jail for years. But I\u0027ll stop it if it costs me my life.\" \"Oh, Jack! don\u0027t \u0027ee do anything rash,\" Mrs. Haden said piteously. \"What can one lad do against two or three hundred men?\" \"Now, mother,\" Jack said promptly, not heeding her appeal, \"what police are there within reach?\" \"The police were all sent away yesterday to Bamp[Pg 102]ton. There were riots there, I heard say. That\u0027s why they chose to-night.\" \"Now the first thing, mother, is to prevent dad from going out to-night. He must be kept out of it, whatever others do. I\u0027ve brought a bottle of gin from Birmingham. Tell him I\u0027ve come over for an hour or two to see schoolmaster, and I\u0027m going back again afterwards, but I\u0027ve brought him this as a present. Get the cork out; he\u0027s sure to drink a glass or two anyhow, perhaps more, but it will send him off to sleep, sure enough. It\u0027s the strongest I could get, and he\u0027s out of the way of drink now. I don\u0027t suppose they\u0027ll miss him when they start; but if any one comes round for him, you tell \u0027em I brought him some Old Tom over, and that he\u0027s so dead sleepy he can\u0027t move. Later on, if you can, get some woman or child to come in, and let them see him, so that there\u0027ll be a witness he was at home when the thing came off, that\u0027ll make him safe. I\u0027ve thought it all over.\" \"But what be\u0027est thou going to do, Jack?\" \"Don\u0027t mind me, mother. I\u0027m going to save the Vaughan colliery. Don\u0027t you fret about me; all you\u0027ve got to do is to make dad drink, which ain\u0027t a difficult job, and to stick to the story that I have been over for an hour to see schoolmaster. Good-bye, mother. Don\u0027t fret; it will all come out right.\" As Jack went down the street he tapped at the door of his friend\u0027s house. \"Is Harry in?\" [Pg 103] Harry was in, and came out at once. \"How\u0027s Annie?\" was Jack\u0027s first question. \"Better, much better, Jack; the doctor thinks she\u0027ll do now. The broth put fresh life into her; we\u0027re all better, Jack, thanks to you.\" \"That\u0027s all right, Harry. Put on your cap and walk with me to the schoolroom. Now,\" he went on, as his friend rejoined him, and they turned up the street, \"will you do a job for me?\" \"Anything in the world, Jack—leastways, anything I can.\" \"You may risk your life, Harry.\" \"All right, Jack, I\u0027ll risk it willing for you. You risked yours for me at the old shaft.\" \"Dost know what\u0027s going to be done to-night Harry?\" \"I\u0027ve heard summat about it.\" \"It must be stopped, Harry, if it costs you and me our lives. What\u0027s that when the whole district depends upon it? If they wreck the engines and flood the mines there will be no work for months; and what\u0027s to become of the women and children then? I\u0027m going to Mr. Merton to tell him, and to get him to write a letter to Sir John Butler—Brook\u0027s place would be watched—he\u0027s the nearest magistrate, and the most active about here, and won\u0027t let the grass grow under his feet by all accounts. The letter must tell him of the attack that is to be made to-night, and ask him to send for the soldiers, if no police can be [Pg 104]had. I want you to take the letter, Harry. Go out the other side of the village and make a long sweep round. Don\u0027t get into the road till you get a full mile out of the place. Then go as hard as you can till you get to Butler\u0027s. Insist on seeing him yourself; say it\u0027s a question of life and death. If he\u0027s out, you must go on to Hooper—he\u0027s the next magistrate. When you have delivered the letter, slip off home and go to bed, and never let out all your life that you took that letter.\" \"All right, Jack; but what be\u0027est thou going to do?\" \"I\u0027m going another way, lad; I\u0027ve got my work too. You\u0027d best stop here, Harry; I will bring the letter to you. It may get out some day that Merton wrote it, and it\u0027s as well you shouldn\u0027t be seen near his place.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87021.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
