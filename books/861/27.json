{"id":44120,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. A CRITICAL MOMENT.","content":"A fter an earnest thanksgiving by Mr. Brook for their success thus far, the whole party partook of what was a heartier meal than usual, consisting of the whole of the remaining food. Then choosing the largest of the drills, a hole was driven in the coal two feet in depth, and in this an unusually heavy charge was placed. \"We\u0027re done for after all,\" Bill Haden suddenly exclaimed. \"Look at the lamp.\" Every one present felt his heart sink at what he saw. A light flame seemed to fill the whole interior of the lamp. To strike a match to light the fuse would be to cause an instant explosion of the gas. The place where they were working being the highest part of the mine, the fiery gas, which made its way out of the coal at all points above the closed doors, had, being lighter than air, mounted there. \"Put the lamps out,\" Jack said quickly, \"the gauze is nearly red hot.\" In a moment they were in darkness. [Pg 254] \"What is to be done now?\" Mr. Brook asked after a pause. There was silence for a while—the case seemed desperate. \"Mr. Brook,\" Jack said after a time, \"it is agreed, is it not, that all here will obey my orders?\" \"Yes, certainly, Jack,\" Mr. Brook answered. \"Whatever they are?\" \"Yes, whatever they are.\" \"Very well,\" Jack said, \"you will all take your coats off and soak them in water, then all set to work to beat the gas out of this heading as far as possible. When that is done as far as can be done, all go into the next stall, and lie down at the upper end, you will be out of the way of the explosion there. Cover your heads with your wet coats, and, Bill, wrap something wet round those cans of powder.\" \"What then, Jack?\" \"That\u0027s all,\" Jack said; \"I will fire the train. If the gas explodes at the match it will light the fuse, so that the wall will blow in anyhow.\" \"No, no,\" a chorus of voices said; \"you will be killed.\" \"I will light it, Jack,\" Bill Haden said; \"I am getting on now, it\u0027s no great odds about me.\" \"No, Dad,\" Jack said, \"I am in charge, and it is for me to do it. You have all promised to obey orders, so set about it at once. Bill, take Mr. Brook up first into the other stall; he won\u0027t be able to find his way about in the dark.\" [Pg 255] Without a word Bill did as he was told, Mr. Brook giving one hearty squeeze to the lad\u0027s hand as he was led away. The others, accustomed to the darkness from boyhood, proceeded at once to carry out Jack\u0027s instructions, wetting their flannel jackets and then beating the roof with them towards the entrance to the stall; for five minutes they continued this, and then Jack said: \"Now, lads, off to the stall as quick as you can; cover your heads well over; lie down. I will be with you in a minute, or—\" or, as Jack knew well, he would be dashed to pieces by the explosion of the gas. He listened until the sound of the last footstep died away—waited a couple of minutes, to allow them to get safely in position at the other end of the next stall—and then, holding the end of the fuse in one hand and the match in the other, he murmured a prayer, and, stooping to the ground, struck the match. No explosion followed; he applied it to the fuse, and ran for his life, down the narrow heading, down the stall, along the horse road, and up the next stall. \"It\u0027s alight,\" he said as he rushed in. A cheer of congratulation and gladness burst from the men. \"Cover your heads close,\" Jack said as he threw himself down; \"the explosion is nigh sure to fire the gas.\" For a minute a silence as of death reigned in the mine; then there was a sharp cracking explosion, followed—or rather, prolonged—by another like thun[Pg 256]der, and, while a flash of fire seemed to surround them, filling the air, firing their clothes, and scorching their limbs, the whole mine shook with a deep continuous roaring. The men knew that the danger was at an end, threw off the covering from their heads, and struck out the fire from their garments. Some were badly burned about the legs, but any word or cry they may have uttered was drowned in the tremendous roar which continued. It was the water from the Logan pit rushing into the Vaughan. For five minutes the noise was like thunder, then, as the pressure from behind decreased, the sound gradually diminished, until, in another five minutes, all was quiet. Then the party rose to their feet. The air in the next stall was clear and fresh, for as the Logan pit had emptied of water, fresh air had of course come down from the surface to take its place. \"We can light our lamps again safely now,\" Bill Haden said. \"We shall want our tools, lads, and the powder; there may be some heavy falls in our way, and we may have hard work yet before we get to the shaft, but the roof rock is strong, so I believe we shall win our way.\" \"It lies to our right,\" Jack said. \"Like our own, it is at the lower end of the pit, so, as long as we don\u0027t mount, we are going right for it.\" There were, as Haden had anticipated, many heavy falls of the roof, but the water had swept passages in them, and it was found easier to get along than the [Pg 257]colliers had expected. Still it was hard work for men weakened by famine; and it took them five hours of labour clearing away masses of rock, and floundering through black mud, often three feet deep, before they made their way to the bottom of the Logan shaft, and saw the light far above them—the light that at one time they had never expected to see again. \"What o\u0027clock is it now, sir?\" Bill Haden asked Mr. Brook, who had from the beginning been the timekeeper of the party. \"Twelve o\u0027clock exactly,\" he replied. \"It is four days and an hour since the pit fired.\" \"What day is it, sir? for I\u0027ve lost all count of time.\" \"Sunday,\" Mr. Brook said after a moment\u0027s thought. \"It could not be better,\" Bill Haden said; \"for there will be thousands of people from all round to visit the mine.\" \"How much powder have you, Bill?\" Jack asked. \"Four twenty-pound cans.\" \"Let us let off ten pounds at a time,\" Jack said. \"Just damp it enough to prevent it from flashing off too suddenly; break up fine some of this damp wood and mix with it, it will add to the smoke.\" In a few minutes the \"devil\" was ready, and a light applied; it blazed furiously for half a minute, sending volumes of light smoke up the shaft. \"Flash off a couple of pounds of dry powder,\" Bill Haden said; \"there is very little draught up the shaft, and it will drive the air up.\" [Pg 258] For twenty minutes they continued letting off \"devils\" and flashing powder. Then they determined to stop, and allow the shaft to clear altogether of the smoke. Presently a small stone fell among them—another—and another, and they knew that some one had noticed the smoke.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87037.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
