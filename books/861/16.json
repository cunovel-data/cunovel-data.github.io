{"id":44109,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XV. THE SEWING CLASS.","content":"S tokebridge contained altogether a population of some three thousand souls, of whom more than half consisted of the men and boys of the Vaughan mine, and the families dependent upon them. It was a place where, except as to accidents at one or other of the pits, news was scarce, and a small thing therefore created much interest. Thus the news that the new schoolmaster had opened a night school, and that some sixteen or eighteen of the lads belonging to the Vaughan had joined it, created quite an excitement. At first the statement was received with positive disbelief. There was no precedent for such a thing, and in its ways at least Stokebridge was strictly conservative. When the tale was confirmed wonder took the place of unbelief. The women were unanimous in the opinion that if the school only kept the lads from drink it would be a blessing to the place. Drink was indeed the grand test by which they viewed all things. To anything which led lads to avoid this curse of their [Pg 147]homes their approval was certain and complete. Whether the acquisition of learning was likely to improve their prospects in life, or to make them better men, was not considered, the great point about the new organization was that it would keep them from the public-houses, the curses of the working men, and still more of the working men\u0027s wives and families, of this country. Among the men, who were, however, disposed to view the matter as a boys\u0027 fancy which would soon die away, the movement met with slight approval. Newfangled notions were held in but low estimation among the miners of Stokebridge. They had got on wi\u0027out larning, and saw no reason why t\u0027 lads could not do as they had done. \"They\u0027ll be a cocking they noses oop aboove their feythers, joost acause they know moore reading and writing, but what good ul it do they I wonder?\" an elderly pitman asked a circle of workmen at the \"Chequers;\" and a general affirmatory grunt betokened assent with the spirit of his words. Among the young men, those of from eighteen to three or four and twenty, the opposition was still stronger, for here a strong feeling of jealousy was aroused at the thought that their juniors were, as they considered, stealing a march upon them. Gibes and jeers were showered upon the \"Bull-dogs,\" and two of them were ducked in the canal by a party of five or six of their elders. On scrambling out, however, they ran back to the village, and the rest of the party, [Pg 148]headed by Jack, at once started on the war-path. Coming up to the band who had assaulted their comrades they fell upon them with fury, and in spite of the latter\u0027s superior individual strength, thrashed them soundly, and then gave them a ducking in the canal, similar to that which they had inflicted. After that it came to be understood in Stokebridge that it was best to leave the bull-dogs alone, or at least to be content with verbal assaults, at which indeed the lads were able to hold their own. But it was among the girls of Stokebridge, those of from fourteen to seventeen years old, that this movement upon the part of the boys excited the greatest discussion and the widest divergence of opinion. Up to the time of the strike Jack Simpson had been by no means popular among their class. It was an anomaly in Stokebridge that a lad should have no avowed favourite of his own age among the lasses. These adhesions were not often of a permanent character, although later on sometimes marriages came of them, but for a time, and until the almost inevitable quarrel came, they were regarded as binding. The lad would sometimes buy a ribbon or neckerchief for the lass, and she and two or three others would accompany him as with some of his comrades he strolled in the lanes on Sunday, or would sit by him on a wall or a balk of timber as he smoked and talked with his friends. Jack\u0027s rigid seclusion after his hour of play was over, his apparent indifference to the lasses of the place, was [Pg 149]felt as a general slight, and resented accordingly; although the girls were not insensible to his prowess in battle and in sports, to his quiet steadiness of character, or to the frankness and good temper of his face. The general opinion, therefore, among the young girls of Stokebridge was that he was \"stuck up,\" although in fact few boys in the place had less of conceit and self-glorification than he had. \"Did \u0027ee ever hear of such a tale,\" asked one of a group of girls sitting together on a bank, while the little ones, of whom they were supposed to be in charge, played and rolled on the grass, \"as for a lot o\u0027 boys to go to school again o\u0027 their own free-will.\" \"I don\u0027t see no good in it,\" another said, \"not for the schooling they\u0027ll get. But if it teaches them to keep out o\u0027 the publics, it will be good for their wives some day.\" \"It will that,\" put in another earnestly; \"my! how feyther did beat mother last night; he were as drunk as could be, and he went on awful.\" \"I think sometimes men are worse nor beasts,\" another said. \"Do \u0027ee know I\u0027ve heard,\" Sarah Shepherd said, \"that the new schoolmistress be a-going to open a night-school for girls, to teach sewing, and cutting out, and summat o\u0027 cooking.\" There was a general exclamation of astonishment, and so strange was the news that it was some time before any one ventured a comment on it. [Pg 150] \"What dost think o\u0027t?\" Sarah questioned at last. \"Only sewing and cutting out and cooking and such like, and not lessons?\" Bess Thompson asked doubtfully. \"Not reg\u0027lar lessons I mean. She\u0027ll read out while the girls work, and perhaps they will read out by turns; not lessons, you know, but stories and tales, and travels, and that kind o\u0027 book. What dost think o\u0027t?\" \"\u0027Twould be a good thing to know how to make dresses,\" Fanny Jones, who was fond of finery, remarked. \"And other things too,\" put in Peggy Martin, \"and to cook too. Mother ain\u0027t a good hand at cooking and it puts feyther in such tempers, and sometimes I hardly wonder. I shall go if some others go. But be\u0027est sure it be true, Sally?\" \"Harry told me,\" she said, \"and I think Jack Simpson told him as the schoolmaster said so.\" The news was too important to be kept to themselves, and there was soon a general move homewards. There Sally Shepherd\u0027s story received confirmation. The schoolmistress had been going from house to house, asking all the women who had daughters between the ages of fifteen and eighteen, to let them attend a working class in the schoolroom two evenings a week, and the answer she almost always received was, \"Well, I ha\u0027 no objection to my lass going if she be willing; and I think it would be very good for her to know how to make her clothes; I can hardly do a stitch myself.\" [Pg 151] Mrs. Dodgson had also informed the women that any of them who liked to supply the material for undergarments or for children\u0027s dresses, could have them for the present made up without charge by the class. \"But suppose they spiles \u0027em?\" \"They wont spoil them. The work may not be very neat at first, but the things will be well cut out and strongly put together. I will see to that.\" In a short time the class was opened, and forty girls at once attended. So pleased were these with their teacher, and with the pleasant books that Mr. Dodgson read to them—for his wife was far too much occupied to read, and too wise to give the girls a distaste for the class by asking them to do so—that the number of applicants for admission soon far exceeded the number who could be received. Mr. Brook heard shortly afterwards from Mr. Dodgson of the success of the scheme and the great benefit which was likely to accrue from it, and at once offered to contribute twenty pounds a year to secure the services of a young woman capable of assisting in the girls\u0027 school by day and of teaching needlework. Thenceforth the number of class evenings was raised to three a week, and sixty girls in all were admitted. The books chosen for reading were not always tales, but for a portion of each evening books treating on domestic matters, the care of a house, the management of illness, cottage gardening, \u0026c., were read; and these were found greatly to interest the hearers. The book [Pg 152]on gardening was a special favourite, and soon the pitmen were astonished to see changes in the tiny plots of ground behind their houses. The men in charge of the pit horses were coaxed for baskets of manure, pennies were saved and devoted to the purchase of seed, and the boys found that the most acceptable present was no longer a gay handkerchief or ribbon, but a pot of flowers. Revolutions are not made in a day, but as month passed after month the change in Stokebridge became marked. The place assumed a smarter and brighter aspect; it was rare to hear bad language from lads or girls in the streets, for the young ones naturally followed the fashion set by their elder brothers and sisters, and as a foul expression not unfrequently cost its utterer a cuff on the head, they soon became rare. The girls became more quiet in demeanour, neater in dress, the boys less noisy and aggressive. The boys\u0027 night-school had increased greatly in number. The Bull-dogs, after much deliberation, had declined to increase their numbers, but at Jack Simpson\u0027s suggestion it had been agreed that any of them might join other similar associations, in order that these might be conducted on the same lines as their own, and the benefits of which they were conscious be thus distributed more widely. Four other \"clubs\" were in consequence established, all looking upon the Bull-dogs as their central association. The vicar of the parish aided the efforts of the school [Pg 153]master and mistress for the improvement of the rising generation of Stokebridge. Hitherto all efforts that way had failed, but he now got over a magic lantern from Birmingham, hiring sets of slides of scenery in foreign countries, astronomical subjects, \u0026c., and gave lectures once a fortnight. These were well attended, and the quiet attention with which he was listened to by the younger portion of his audience, contrasted so strongly with the indifference or uproar with which a similar attempt had been met some two years before, that he told Mr. Brook something like a miracle was being wrought in the parish. Mr. Brook warmly congratulated Mr. and Mrs. Dodgson on the change, but these frankly said that although they had done their best, the change was in no slight degree due to the influence of one of the pit lads, with whom Mr. Merton had taken great pains, and who was certainly a remarkable lad. \"Ah, indeed,\" Mr. Brook said. \"I have a faint recollection of his speaking to me some years ago of one of the boys; and, now I think of it, he is the same boy who behaved so bravely in going down that old shaft to save another boy\u0027s life. The men gave him a gold watch; of course, I remember all about it now. I am glad to hear that he is turning out so well. In a few years I must see what I can do for him.\" Mr. Dodgson would have said much more, but Mr. Merton had impressed upon him that Jack would object, above all things, to be brought forward, and [Pg 154]that it was better to let him work his way steadily and bide his time. It was not for some months after the sewing classes had been instituted that those for cooking were established. The difficulty was not as to the necessary outlay for stoves and utensils, for these Mr. Brook at once offered to provide, but as to the food to be cooked. The experiments began on a small scale. At first Mrs. Dodgson sent round to say that in all cases of illness, she would have broths, puddings, and cooling drinks prepared at the schools free of charge, upon the necessary materials being sent to her. This was followed by the plan of buying the materials for food for invalids, which was to be supplied at a price that just paid the cost. Then little steak puddings and pies were made, and these commanded a ready sale; excellent soups from cheap materials were also provided, and for this in winter the demand was greater than they could supply; and so the work was extended until the two stoves were fully occupied for three days a week. Eight girls at a time were instructed in cookery, doing the whole work under the supervision of the mistress. Two fresh hands came as two left each week; thus each received a month\u0027s teaching. On the first week the new-comers simply cleaned and washed the utensils, stoves, \u0026c., during the remaining three weeks they learned to make simple soups, puddings, and pies, to cook meat and vegetables. The time was short for the purpose, but the girls were delighted with their lessons, and [Pg 155]took the greatest pride in keeping up the reputation of the school kitchens, and learned at any rate sufficient to enable them to assist their mothers at home with such effect, that the pitmen of Stokebridge were astonished at the variety and improvement of their fare. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87026.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
