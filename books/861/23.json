{"id":44116,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. THE SOLUTION.","content":"A mong others who talked over Nelly Hardy\u0027s future were Mr. and Mrs. Dodgson. They were very fond of her, for from the first she had been the steadiest and most industrious of the young girls of the place, and by diligent study had raised herself far in advance of the rest. She had too been always so willing and ready to oblige and help that she was a great favourite with both. \"I have been thinking,\" Mrs. Dodgson said to her husband on the evening of the day of John Hardy\u0027s death, \"whether, as Miss Bolton, the assistant mistress, is going to leave at the end of the month, to be married, Nelly Hardy would not make an excellent successor for her. There is no doubt she is fully capable of filling the situation; her manners are all that could be wished, and she has great influence with the younger children. The only drawback was her disreputable old father. It would hardly have done for my assistant to appear in school in the morning with a black eye, and for all the children to know that [Pg 210]her drunken father had been beating her. Now he is gone that objection is at an end. She and her mother, who has been as bad as the father, but is now, I believe, almost imbecile, could live in the little cottage Miss Bolton occupies.\" \"I think it would be an excellent plan, my dear, excellent; we could have no one we should like better, or who could be a more trustworthy and helpful assistant to you. By all means let it be Nelly Hardy. I will go up and speak to Mr. Brook to-morrow. As he is our patron I must consult him, but he will agree to anything we propose. Let us say nothing about it until you tell her yourself after the funeral.\" Mrs. Dodgson saw Nelly Hardy several times in the next few days, and went in and sat with her as she worked at her mourning; but it was not until John Hardy was laid in the churchyard that she opened the subject. \"Come up in the morning, my dear,\" she had said that day; \"I want to have a talk with you.\" On the following morning Nelly, in her neatly-fitting black mourning dress, made her appearance at the school-house, after breakfast, a quarter of an hour before school began. \"Sit down, my dear,\" Mrs. Dodgson said, \"I have some news to give you which will, I think, please you. Of course you have been thinking what to do?\" \"Yes, \u0027m; I have made up my mind to try and get work in a factory.\" [Pg 211] \"Indeed! Nelly,\" Mrs. Dodgson said, surprised; \"I should have thought that was the last thing that you would like.\" \"It is not what I like,\" Nelly said quietly, \"but what is best. I would rather go into service, and as I am fond of children and used to them, I might, with your kind recommendation, get a comfortable situation; but in that case mother must go to the house, and I could not bear to think of her there. She is very helpless, and of late she has come to look to me, and would be miserable among strangers. I could earn enough at a factory to keep us both, living very closely.\" \"Well, Nelly, your decision does you honour, but I think my plan is better. Have you heard that Miss Bolton is going to leave us?\" \"I have heard she was engaged to be married some day, \u0027m, but I did not know the time was fixed.\" \"She leaves at the end of this month, that is in a fortnight, and her place has already been filled up. Upon the recommendation of myself and Mr. Dodgson, Mr. Brook has appointed Miss Nelly Hardy as her successor.\" \"Me!\" exclaimed Nelly, rising with a bewildered air. \"Oh, Mrs. Dodgson, you cannot mean it?\" \"I do, indeed, Nelly. Your conduct here has been most satisfactory in every way, you have a great influence with the children, and your attainments and knowledge are amply sufficient for the post of my assistant. You will, of course, have Miss Bolton\u0027s [Pg 212]cottage, and can watch over your mother. You will have opportunities for studying to fit yourself to take another step upwards, and become a head-mistress some day.\" Mrs. Dodgson had continued talking, for she saw that Nelly was too much agitated and overcome to speak. \"Oh, Mrs. Dodgson,\" she sobbed, \"how can I thank you enough?\" \"There are no thanks due, my dear. Of course I want the best assistant I can get, and I know of no one upon whom I can rely more thoroughly than yourself. You have no one but yourself to thank, for it is your good conduct and industry alone which have made you what you are, and that under circumstances of the most unfavourable kind. But there is the bell ringing for school. I suppose I may tell Mr. Brook that you accept the situation; the pay, thirty pounds a year and the cottage, is not larger, perhaps, than you might earn at a factory, but I think—\" \"Oh, Mrs. Dodgson,\" Nelly said, smiling through her tears, \"I accept, I accept. I would rather live on a crust of bread here than work in a factory, and if I had had the choice of everything I should prefer this.\" Mr. Dodgson here came in, shook Nelly\u0027s hand and congratulated her, and with a happy heart the girl took her way home. Jack, upon his return from the pit, found Nelly awaiting him at the corner where for years she had [Pg 213]stood. He had seen her once since her father\u0027s death, and had pressed her hand warmly to express his sympathy, but he was too honest to condole with her on a loss which was, he knew, a relief. He and Harry had in the intervening time talked much of Nelly\u0027s prospects. Jack was averse in the extreme to her going into service, still more averse to her going into a factory, but could suggest no alternative plan. \"If she were a boy,\" he said, \"it would be easy enough. I am getting eighteen shillings a week now, and could let her have five easily, and she might take in dressmaking. There are plenty of people in the villages round would be glad to get their dresses made; but she would have to live till she got known a bit, and you know she wouldn\u0027t take my five shillings. I wouldn\u0027t dare offer it to her. Now if it was you there would be no trouble at all; you would take it, of course, just as I should take it of you, but she wouldn\u0027t, because she\u0027s a lass—it beats me altogether. I might get mother to offer her the money, but Nelly would know it was me sharp enough, and it would be all the same.\" \"I really think that Nelly might do well wi\u0027 dressmaking,\" Harry said after a pause. \"Here all the lasses ha\u0027 learnt to work, but, as you say, in the other villages they know no more than we did here three years back; if we got some bills printed and sent \u0027em round, I should say she might do. There are other things you don\u0027t seem to ha\u0027 thought on, Jack,\" he said hesitatingly. \"You\u0027re only eighteen yet, but you are earning near a [Pg 214]pound a week, and in another two or three years will be getting man\u0027s pay, and you are sure to rise. Have you never thought of marrying Nelly?\" Jack jumped as if he had trodden on a snake. \"I marry Nelly!\" he said in astonishment. \"What! I marry Nelly! are you mad, Harry? You know I have made up my mind not to marry for years, not till I\u0027m thirty and have made my way; and as to Nelly, why I never thought of her, nor of any other lass in that way; her least of all; why, she is like my sister. What ever put such a ridiculous idea in your head? Why, at eighteen boys haven\u0027t left school and are looking forward to going to college; those boy and girl marriages among our class are the cause of half our troubles. Thirty is quite time enough to marry. How Nelly would laugh if she knew what you\u0027d said!\" \"I should advise you not to tell her,\" Harry said dryly; \"I greatly mistake if she would regard it as a laughing matter at all.\" \"No, lasses are strange things,\" Jack meditated again. \"But, Harry, you are as old as I am, and are earning the same wage; why don\u0027t you marry her?\" \"I would,\" Harry said earnestly, \"to-morrow if she\u0027d have me.\" \"You would!\" Jack exclaimed, as much astonished as by his friend\u0027s first proposition. \"To think of that now! Why, you have always been with her just as I have. You have never shown that you cared for her, [Pg 215]never given her presents, nor walked with her, nor anything. And do you really care for her, Harry?\" \"Aye,\" Harry said shortly, \"I have cared for her for years.\" \"And to think that I have never seen that!\" Jack said. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me? Why, you are as difficult to understand as she is, and I thought I knew you so well!\" \"What would have been the use?\" Harry said. \"Nelly likes me as a friend, that\u0027s all.\" \"That\u0027s it,\" Jack said. \"Of course when people are friends they don\u0027t think of each other in any other way. Still, Harry, she may get to in time. Nelly\u0027s pretty well a woman, she\u0027s seventeen now, but she has no one else after her that I know of.\" \"Well, Jack, I fancy she could have plenty after her, for she\u0027s the prettiest and best girl o\u0027 the place; but you see, you are always about wi\u0027 her, and I think that most people think it will be a match some day.\" \"People are fools,\" Jack burst out wrathfully. \"Who says so? just tell me who says so?\" \"People say so, Jack. When a young chap and a lass walk together people suppose there is something in it, and you and Nelly ha\u0027 been walking together for the last five years.\" \"Walking together!\" Jack repeated angrily; \"we have been going about together of course, and you have generally been with us, and often enough half-a-dozen others; that is not like walking together. Nelly knew, [Pg 216]and every one knew, that we agreed to be friends from the day we stood on the edge of the old shaft when you were in the water below, and we have never changed since.\" \"I know you have never changed, Jack, never thought of Nelly but as a true friend. I did not know whether now you might think differently. I wanted to hear from your own lips. Now I know you don\u0027t, that you have no thought of ever being more than a true friend to her, I shall try if I cannot win her.\" \"Do,\" Jack said, shaking his friend\u0027s hand. \"I am sure I wish you success. Nothing in the world would please me so much as to see my two friends marry, and though I do think, yes, I really do, Harry, that young marriages are bad, yet I am quite sure that you and Nelly would be happy together anyhow. And when do you mean to ask her?\" \"What an impatient fellow you are, Jack!\" Harry said smiling. \"Nelly has no more idea that I care for her than you had, and I am not going to tell her so all at once. I don\u0027t think,\" he said gravely, \"mark me, Jack, I don\u0027t think Nelly will ever have me, but if patience and love can win her I shall succeed in the end.\" Jack looked greatly surprised again. \"Don\u0027t say any more about it, Jack,\" Harry went on. \"It \u0027ull be a long job o\u0027 work, but I can bide my time; but above all, if you wish me well, do not even breathe a word to Nelly of what I have said.\" From this interview Jack departed much mystified. [Pg 217] \"It seems to me,\" he muttered to himself, \"lads when they\u0027re in love get to be like lasses, there\u0027s no understanding them. I know nowt of love myself, and what I\u0027ve read in books didn\u0027t seem natural, but I suppose it must be true, for even Harry, who I thought I knew as well as myself, turned as mysterious as—well as a ghost. What does he mean by he\u0027s got to be patient, and to wait, and it will be a long job. If he likes Nelly and Nelly likes him—and why shouldn\u0027t she?—I don\u0027t know why they shouldn\u0027t marry in a year or two, though I do hate young marriages. Anyhow I\u0027ll talk to her about the dressmaking idea. If Harry\u0027s got to make love to her, it will be far better for him to do it here than to have to go walking her out o\u0027 Sundays at Birmingham. If she would but let me help her a bit till she\u0027s got into business it would be as easy as possible.\" Jack, however, soon had the opportunity of laying his scheme fully before Nelly Hardy, and when she had turned off from the road with him she broke out: \"Oh, Jack, I have such a piece of news; but perhaps you know it, do you?\" she asked jealously. \"No, I don\u0027t know any particular piece of news.\" \"Not anything likely to interest me, Jack?\" \"No,\" Jack said puzzled. \"Honour, you haven\u0027t the least idea what it is?\" \"Honour, I haven\u0027t,\" Jack said. \"I\u0027m going to be a schoolmistress in place of Miss Bolton.\" THE NEW SCHOOLMISTRESS. THE NEW SCHOOLMISTRESS. [Pg 218]\"No!\" Jack shouted delightedly; \"I am glad, Nelly, I am glad. Why, it is just the thing for you; Harry and I have been puzzling our heads all the week as to what you should do!\" \"And what did your united wisdom arrive at?\" Nelly laughed. \"We thought you might do here at dressmaking,\" Jack said, \"after a bit, you know.\" \"The thought was not a bad one,\" she said; \"it never occurred to me, and had this great good fortune not have come to me I might perhaps have tried. It was good of you to think of it. And so you never heard a whisper about the schoolmistress? I thought you might perhaps have suggested it somehow, you know you always do suggest things here.\" \"No, indeed, Nelly, I did not hear Miss Bolton was going.\" \"I am glad,\" the girl said. \"Are you?\" Jack replied in surprise. \"Why, Nelly, wouldn\u0027t you have liked me to have helped you?\" \"Yes and no, Jack; but no more than yes. I do owe everything to you. It was you who made me your friend, you who taught me, you who urged me on, you who have made me what I am. No, Jack, dear,\" she said, seeing that Jack looked pained at her thanks; \"I have never thanked you before, and I must do it now. I owe everything to you, and in one way I should have been pleased to owe this to you also, but in another way I am pleased not to do so because my gaining it [Pg 219]by, if I may say so, my own merits, show that I have done my best to prove worthy of your kindness and friendship.\" Tears of earnestness stood in her eyes, and Jack felt that disclaimer would be ungracious. \"I am glad,\" he said again after a pause. \"And now, Miss Hardy,\" and he touched his hat laughing, \"that you have risen in the world, I hope you are not going to take airs upon yourself.\" Nelly laughed. \"It is strange,\" she said, \"that I should be the first to take a step upwards, for Mrs. Dodgson is going to help me to go in and qualify for a head-schoolmistress-ship some day; but, Jack, it is only for a little time. You laugh and call me Miss Hardy to-day, but the time will come when I shall say \u0027sir\u0027 to you; you are longer beginning, but you will rise far higher; but we shall always be friends; shall we not, Jack?\" \"Always, Nelly,\" Jack said earnestly. \"Wherever or whatever Jack Simpson may be, he will ever be your true and faithful friend, and nothing which may ever happen to me, no rise I may ever make, will give me the pleasure which this good fortune which has befallen you has done. If I ever rise it will make me happy to help Harry, but I know you would never have let me help you, and this thought would have marred my life. Now that I see you in a position in which I am sure you will be successful, and which is an honourable and pleasant one, I shall the more enjoy [Pg 220]my rise when it comes.—Does any one else know of it?\" he asked as they went on their way. \"No one,\" she said. \"Who should know it before you?\" \"Harry will be as glad as I am,\" he said, remembering his friend\u0027s late assertion. \"Yes, Harry will be very glad too,\" Nelly said; but Jack felt that Harry\u0027s opinion was of comparatively little importance in her eyes. \"He is a good honest fellow is Harry, and I am sure he will be pleased, and so I hope will everyone.\" Jack felt that the present moment was not a propitious one for putting in a word for his friend. Harry Shepherd carried out his purpose. For two years he waited, and then told his love to Nelly Hardy, one bright Sunday afternoon when they were walking in the lane. \"No, Harry, no,\" she said humbly and sadly; \"it can never be, do not ask me, I am so, so sorry.\" \"Can it never be?\" Harry asked. \"Never,\" the girl said; \"you know yourself, Harry, it can never be. I have seen this coming on for two years now, and it has grieved me so; but you know, I am sure you know, why it cannot be.\" \"I know,\" the young fellow said. \"I have always known that you cared for Jack a thousand times more than for me, and it\u0027s quite natural, for he is worth a thousand of me; but then, then—\" and he hesitated. \"But then,\" she went on. \"Jack does not love me, [Pg 221]and you do. That is so, Harry; but since I was a child I have loved him. I know, none better, that he never thought of me except as a friend, that he scarcely considered me as a girl. I have never thought that it would be otherwise. I could hardly wish that it were. Jack will rise to be a great man, and must marry a lady, but,\" she said steadfastly, \"I can go on loving him till I die.\" \"I have not hoped much, Nelly, but remember always, that I have always cared for you. Since you first became Jack\u0027s friend I have cared for you. If he had loved you I could even stand aside and be glad to see you both happy, but I have known always that this could never be. Jack\u0027s mind was ever so much given up to study, he is not like us, and does not dream of a house and love till he has made his mark in the world. Remember only that I love you as you love Jack, and shall love as faithfully. Some day, perhaps, long hence,\" he added as Nelly shook her head, \"you may not think differently, but may come to see that it is better to make one man\u0027s life happy than to cling for ever to the remembrance of another. At any rate you will always think of me as your true friend, Nelly, always trust me?\" \"Always, Harry, in the future more than lately, for I have seen this coming. Now that we understand each other we can be quite friends again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3173/87033.html","bookId":861,"book":{"id":861,"title":"Facing Death","description":"简介： A row of brick-built houses with slate roofs, at the edge of a large mining village in Staffordshire.
