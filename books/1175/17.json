{"id":16152,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"\"Aunt Fanny doesn\u0027t look much better,\" George said to his mother, a few minutes after their arrival, on the night they got home. He stood with a towel in her doorway, concluding some sketchy ablutions before going downstairs to a supper which Fanny was hastily preparing for them. Isabel had not telegraphed; Fanny was taken by surprise when they drove up in a station cab at eleven o\u0027clock; and George instantly demanded \"a little decent food.\" (Some criticisms of his had publicly disturbed the composure of the dining-car steward four hours previously.) \"I never saw anybody take things so hard as she seems to,\" he observed, his voice muffled by the towel. \"Doesn\u0027t she get over it at all? I thought she\u0027d feel better when we turned over the insurance to her—gave it to her absolutely, without any strings to it. She looks about a thousand years old!\" \"She looks quite girlish, sometimes, though,\" his mother said. \"Has she looked that way much since father—\" \"Not so much,\" Isabel said thoughtfully. \"But she will, as times goes on.\" \"Time\u0027ll have to hurry, then, it seems to me,\" George observed, returning to his own room. When they went down to the dining room, he pronounced acceptable the salmon salad, cold beef, cheese, and cake which Fanny made ready for them without disturbing the servants. The journey had fatigued Isabel, she ate nothing, but sat to observe with tired pleasure the manifestations of her son\u0027s appetite, meanwhile giving her sister-in-law a brief summary of the events of commencement. But presently she kissed them both good-night—taking care to kiss George lightly upon the side of his head, so as not to disturb his eating—and left aunt and nephew alone together. \"It never was becoming to her to look pale,\" Fanny said absently, a few moments after Isabel\u0027s departure. \"Wha\u0027d you say, Aunt Fanny?\" \"Nothing. I suppose your mother\u0027s been being pretty gay? Going a lot?\" \"How could she?\" George asked cheerfully. \"In mourning, of course all she could do was just sit around and look on. That\u0027s all Lucy could do either, for the matter of that.\" \"I suppose so,\" his aunt assented. \"How did Lucy get home?\" George regarded her with astonishment. \"Why, on the train with the rest of us, of course.\" \"I didn\u0027t mean that,\" Fanny explained. \"I meant from the station. Did you drive out to their house with her before you came here?\" \"No. She drove home with her father, of course.\" \"Oh, I see. So Eugene came to the station to meet you.\" \"To meet us?\" George echoed, renewing his attack upon the salmon salad. \"How could he?\" \"I don\u0027t know what you mean,\" Fanny said drearily, in the desolate voice that had become her habit. \"I haven\u0027t seen him while your mother\u0027s been away.\" \"Naturally,\" said George. \"He\u0027s been East himself.\" At this Fanny\u0027s drooping eyelids opened wide. \"Did you see him?\" \"Well, naturally, since he made the trip home with us!\" \"He did?\" she said sharply. \"He\u0027s been with you all the time?\" \"No; only on the train and the last three days before we left. Uncle George got him to come.\" Fanny\u0027s eyelids drooped again, and she sat silent until George pushed back his chair and lit a cigarette, declaring his satisfaction with what she had provided. \"You\u0027re a fine housekeeper,\" he said benevolently. \"You know how to make things look dainty as well as taste the right way. I don\u0027t believe you\u0027d stay single very long if some of the bachelors and widowers around town could just once see—\" She did not hear him. \"It\u0027s a little odd,\" she said. \"What\u0027s odd?\" \"Your mother\u0027s not mentioning that Mr. Morgan had been with you.\" \"Didn\u0027t think of it, I suppose,\" said George carelessly; and, his benevolent mood increasing, he conceived the idea that a little harmless rallying might serve to elevate his aunt\u0027s drooping spirits. \"I\u0027ll tell you something, in confidence,\" he said solemnly. She looked up, startled. \"What?\" \"Well, it struck me that Mr. Morgan was looking pretty absentminded, most of the time; and he certainly is dressing better than he used to. Uncle George told me he heard that the automobile factory had been doing quite well—won a race, too! I shouldn\u0027t be a bit surprised if all the young fellow had been waiting for was to know he had an assured income before he proposed.\" \"What \u0027young fellow\u0027?\" \"This young fellow Morgan,\" laughed George; \"Honestly, Aunt Fanny, I shouldn\u0027t be a bit surprised to have him request an interview with me any day, and declare that his intentions are honourable, and ask my permission to pay his addresses to you. What had I better tell him?\" Fanny burst into tears. \"Good heavens!\" George cried. \"I was only teasing. I didn\u0027t mean—\" \"Let me alone,\" she said lifelessly; and, continuing to weep, rose and began to clear away the dishes. \"Please, Aunt Fanny—\" \"Just let me alone.\" George was distressed. \"I didn\u0027t mean anything, Aunt Fanny! I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d got so sensitive as all that.\" \"You\u0027d better go up to bed,\" she said desolately, going on with her work and her weeping. \"Anyhow,\" he insisted, \"do let these things wait. Let the servants \u0027tend to the table in the morning.\" \"No.\" \"But, why not?\" \"Just let me alone.\" \"Oh, Lord!\" George groaned, going to the door. There he turned. \"See here, Aunt Fanny, there\u0027s not a bit of use your bothering about those dishes tonight. What\u0027s the use of a butler and three maids if—\" \"Just let me alone.\" He obeyed, and could still hear a pathetic sniffing from the dining room as he went up the stairs. \"By George!\" he grunted, as he reached his own room; and his thought was that living with a person so sensitive to kindly raillery might prove lugubrious. He whistled, long and low, then went to the window and looked through the darkness to the great silhouette of his grandfather\u0027s house. Lights were burning over there, upstairs; probably his newly arrived uncle was engaged in talk with the Major. George\u0027s glance lowered, resting casually upon the indistinct ground, and he beheld some vague shapes, unfamiliar to him. Formless heaps, they seemed; but, without much curiosity, he supposed that sewer connections or water pipes might be out of order, making necessary some excavations. He hoped the work would not take long; he hated to see that sweep of lawn made unsightly by trenches and lines of dirt, even temporarily. Not greatly disturbed, however, he pulled down the shade, yawned, and began to, undress, leaving further investigation for the morning. But in the morning he had forgotten all about it, and raised his shade, to let in the light, without even glancing toward the ground. Not until he had finished dressing did he look forth from his window, and then his glance was casual. The next instant his attitude became electric, and he gave utterance to a bellow of dismay. He ran from his room, plunged down the stairs, out of the front door, and, upon a nearer view of the destroyed lawn, began to release profanity upon the breezeless summer air, which remained unaffected. Between his mother\u0027s house and his grandfather\u0027s, excavations for the cellars of five new houses were in process, each within a few feet of its neighbour. Foundations of brick were being laid; everywhere were piles of brick and stacked lumber, and sand heaps and mortar\u0027 beds. It was Sunday, and so the workmen implicated in these defacings were denied what unquestionably; they would have considered a treat; but as the fanatic orator continued the monologue, a gentleman in flannels emerged upward from one of the excavations, and regarded him contemplatively. \"Obtaining any relief, nephew?\" he inquired with some interest. \"You must have learned quite a number of those expressions in childhood— it\u0027s so long since I\u0027d heard them I fancied they were obsolete.\" \"Who wouldn\u0027t swear?\" George demanded hotly. \"In the name of God, what does grandfather mean, doing such things?\" \"My private opinion is,\" said Amberson gravely, \"he desires to increase his income by building these houses to rent.\" \"Well, in the name of God, can\u0027t he increase his income any other way but this?\" \"In the name of God, it would appear he couldn\u0027t.\" \"It\u0027s beastly! It\u0027s a damn degradation! It\u0027s a crime!\" \"I don\u0027t know about its being a crime,\" said his uncle, stepping over some planks to join him. \"It might be a mistake, though. Your mother said not to tell you until we got home, so as not to spoil commencement for you. She rather feared you\u0027d be upset.\" \"Upset! Oh, my Lord, I should think I would be upset! He\u0027s in his second childhood. What did you let him do it for, in the name of—\" \"Make it in the name of heaven this time, George; it\u0027s Sunday. Well, I thought, myself, it was a mistake.\" \"I should say so!\" \"Yes,\" said Amberson. \"I wanted him to put up an apartment building instead of these houses.\" \"An apartment building! Here?\" \"Yes; that was my idea.\" George struck his hands together despairingly. \"An apartment house! Oh, my Lord!\" \"Don\u0027t worry! Your grandfather wouldn\u0027t listen to me, but he\u0027ll wish he had, some day. He says that people aren\u0027t going to live in miserable little flats when they can get a whole house with some grass in front and plenty of backyard behind. He sticks it out that apartment houses will never do in a town of this type, and when I pointed out to him that a dozen or so of \u0027em already are doing, he claimed it was just the novelty, and that they\u0027d all be empty as soon as people got used to \u0027em. So he\u0027s putting up these houses.\" \"Is he getting miserly in his old age?\" \"Hardly! Look what he gave Sydney and Amelia!\" \"I don\u0027t mean he\u0027s a miser, of course,\" said George. \"Heaven knows he\u0027s liberal enough with mother and me; but why on earth didn\u0027t he sell something or other rather than do a thing like this?\" \"As a matter of fact,\" Amberson returned coolly, \"I believe he has sold something or other, from time to time.\" \"Well, in heaven\u0027s name,\" George cried, \"what did he do it for?\" \"To get money,\" his uncle mildly replied. \"That\u0027s my deduction.\" \"I suppose you\u0027re joking—or trying to!\" \"That\u0027s the best way to look at it,\" Amberson said amiably. \"Take the whole thing as a joke—and in the meantime, if you haven\u0027t had your breakfast—\" \"I haven\u0027t!\" \"Then if I were you I\u0027d go in and gets some. And\"—he paused, becoming serious—\"and if I were you I wouldn\u0027t say anything to your grandfather about this.\" \"I don\u0027t think I could trust myself to speak to him about it,\" said George. \"I want to treat him respectfully, because he is my grandfather, but I don\u0027t believe I could if I talked to him about such a thing as this!\" And with a gesture of despair, plainly signifying that all too soon after leaving bright college years behind him he had entered into the full tragedy of life, George turned bitterly upon his heel and went into the house for his breakfast. His uncle, with his head whimsically upon one side, gazed after him not altogether unsympathetically, then descended again into the excavation whence he had lately emerged. Being a philosopher he was not surprised, that afternoon, in the course of a drive he took in the old carriage with the Major, when, George was encountered upon the highway, flashing along in his runabout with Lucy beside him and Pendennis doing better than three minutes. \"He seems to have recovered,\" Amberson remarked: \"Looks in the highest good spirits.\" \"I beg your pardon.\" \"Your grandson,\" Amberson explained. \"He was inclined to melancholy this morning, but seemed jolly enough just now when they passed us.\" \"What was he melancholy about? Not getting remorseful about all the money he\u0027s spent at college, was he?\" The Major chuckled feebly, but with sufficient grimness. \"I wonder what he thinks I\u0027m made of,\" he concluded querulously. \"Gold,\" his son suggested, adding gently, \"And he\u0027s right about part of you, father.\" \"What part?\" \"Your heart.\" The Major laughed ruefully. \"I suppose that may account for how heavy it feels, sometimes, nowadays. This town seems to be rolling right over that old heart you mentioned, George—rolling over it and burying it under! When I think of those devilish workmen digging up my lawn, yelling around my house—\" \"Never mind, father. Don\u0027t think of it. When things are a nuisance it\u0027s a good idea not to keep remembering \u0027em.\" \"I try not to,\" the old gentleman murmured. \"I try to keep remembering that I won\u0027t be remembering anything very long.\" And, somehow convinced that this thought was a mirthful one, he laughed loudly, and slapped his knee. \"Not so very long now, my boy!\" he chuckled, continuing to echo his own amusement. \"Not so very long. Not so very long!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677/49437.html","bookId":1175,"book":{"id":1175,"title":"The Magnificent Ambersons 安伯森情史","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM"}}
