{"id":16148,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"Isabel\u0027s uneasiness about her husbands health—sometimes reflected in her letters to George during the winter that followed—had not been alleviated when the accredited Senior returned for his next summer vacation, and she confided to him in his room, soon after his arrival, that \"something\" the doctor had said to her lately had made her more uneasy than ever. \"Still worrying over his rolling-mills investments?\" George asked, not seriously impressed. \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s past that stage from what Dr Rainey says. His worries only aggravate his condition now. Dr. Rainey says we ought to get him away.\" \"Well, let\u0027s do it, then.\" \"He won\u0027t go.\" \"He\u0027s a man awfully set in his ways; that\u0027s true,\" said George. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything much the matter with him, though, and he looks just the same to me. Have you seen Lucy lately? How is she?\" \"Hasn\u0027t she written you?\" \"Oh, about once a month,\" he answered carelessly. \"Never says much about herself. How\u0027s she look?\" \"She looks—pretty!\" said Isabel. \"I suppose she wrote you they\u0027ve moved?\" \"Yes; I\u0027ve got her address. She said they were building.\" \"They did. It\u0027s all finished, and they\u0027ve been in it a month. Lucy is so capable; she keeps house exquisitely. It\u0027s small, but oh, such a pretty little house!\" \"Well, that\u0027s fortunate,\" George said. \"One thing I\u0027ve always felt they didn\u0027t know a great deal about is architecture.\" \"Don\u0027t they?\" asked Isabel, surprised. \"Anyhow, their house is charming. It\u0027s way out beyond the end of Amberson Boulevard; it\u0027s quite near that big white house with a gray-green roof somebody built out there a year or so ago. There are any number of houses going up, out that way; and the trolley-line runs within a block of them now, on the next street, and the traction people are laying tracks more than three miles beyond. I suppose you\u0027ll be driving out to see Lucy to- morrow.\" \"I thought—\" George hesitated. \"I thought perhaps I\u0027d go after dinner this evening.\" At this his mother laughed, not astonished. \"It was only my feeble joke about \u0027to-morrow,\u0027 Georgie! I was pretty sure you couldn\u0027t wait that long. Did Lucy write you about the factory?\" \"No. What factory?\" \"The automobile shops. They had rather a dubious time at first, I\u0027m afraid, and some of Eugene\u0027s experiments turned out badly, but this spring they\u0027ve finished eight automobiles and sold them all, and they\u0027ve got twelve more almost finished, and they\u0027re sold already! Eugene\u0027s so gay over it!\" \"What do his old sewing-machines look like? Like that first one he had when they came here?\" \"No, indeed! These have rubber tires blown up with air—pneumatic! And they aren\u0027t so high; they\u0027re very easy to get into, and the engine\u0027s in front—Eugene thinks that\u0027s a great improvement. They\u0027re very interesting to look at; behind the driver\u0027s seat there\u0027s a sort of box where four people can sit, with a step and a little door in the rear, and—\" \"I know all about it,\" said George. \"I\u0027ve seen any number like that, East. You can see all you want of \u0027em, if you stand on Fifth Avenue half an hour, any afternoon. I\u0027ve seen half-a-dozen go by almost at the same time—within a few minutes, anyhow; and of course electric hansoms are a common sight there any day. I hired one, myself, the last time I was there. How fast do Mr. Morgan\u0027s machines go?\" \"Much too fast! It\u0027s very exhilarating—but rather frightening; and they do make a fearful uproar. He says, though, he thinks he sees a way to get around the noisiness in time.\" \"I don\u0027t mind the noise,\" said George. \"Give me a horse, for mine, though, any day. I must get up a race with one of these things: Pendennis\u0027ll leave it one mile behind in a two-mile run. How\u0027s grandfather?\" \"He looks well, but he complains sometimes of his heart: I suppose that\u0027s natural at his age—and it\u0027s an Amberson trouble.\" Having mentioned this, she looked anxious instantly. \"Did you ever feel any weakness there, Georgie?\" \"No!\" he laughed. \"Are you sure, dear?\" \"No!\" And he laughed again. \"Did you?\" \"Oh, I think not—at least, the doctor told me he thought my heart was about all right. He said I needn\u0027t be alarmed.\" \"I should think not! Women do seem to be always talking about health: I suppose they haven\u0027t got enough else to think of!\" \"That must be it,\" she said gayly. \"We\u0027re an idle lot!\" George had taken off his coat. \"I don\u0027t like to hint to a lady,\" he said, \"but I do want to dress before dinner.\" \"Don\u0027t be long; I\u0027ve got to do a lot of looking at you, dear!\" She kissed him and ran away singing. But his Aunt Fanny was not so fond; and at the dinner-table there came a spark of liveliness into her eye when George patronizingly asked her what was the news in her own \"particular line of sport.\" \"What do you mean, Georgie?\" she asked quietly. \"Oh I mean: What\u0027s the news in the fast set generally? You been causing any divorces lately?\" \"No,\" said Fanny, the spark in her eye getting brighter. \"I haven\u0027t been causing anything.\" \"Well, what\u0027s the gossip? You usually hear pretty much everything that goes on around the nooks and crannies in this town, I hear. What\u0027s the last from the gossips\u0027 corner, auntie?\" Fanny dropped her eyes, and the spark was concealed, but a movement of her lower lip betokened a tendency to laugh, as she replied. \"There hasn\u0027t been much gossip lately, except the report that Lucy Morgan and Fred Kinney are engaged—and that\u0027s quite old, by this time.\" Undeniably, this bit of mischief was entirely successful, for there was a clatter upon George\u0027s plate. \"What—what do you think you\u0027re talking about?\" he gasped. Miss Fanny looked up innocently. \"About the report of Lucy Morgan\u0027s engagement to Fred Kinney.\" George turned dumbly to his mother, and Isabel shook her head reassuringly. \"People are always starting rumours,\" she said. \"I haven\u0027t paid any attention to this one.\" \"But you—you\u0027ve heard it?\" he stammered. \"Oh, one hears all sorts of nonsense, dear. I haven\u0027t the slightest idea that it\u0027s true.\" \"Then you have heard it!\" \"I wouldn\u0027t let it take my appetite,\" his father suggested drily. \"There are plenty of girls in the world!\" George turned pale. \"Eat your dinner, Georgie,\" his aunt said sweetly. \"Food will do you good. I didn\u0027t say I knew this rumour was true. I only said I\u0027d heard it.\" \"When? When did you hear it!\" \"Oh, months ago!\" And Fanny found any further postponement of laughter impossible. \"Fanny, you\u0027re a hard-hearted creature,\" Isabel said gently. \"You really are. Don\u0027t pay any attention to her, George. Fred Kinney\u0027s only a clerk in his uncle\u0027s hardware place: he couldn\u0027t marry for ages—even if anybody would accept him!\" George breathed tumultuously. \"I don\u0027t care anything about \u0027ages\u0027! What\u0027s that got to do with it?\" he said, his thoughts appearing to be somewhat disconnected. \"Ages,\u0027 don\u0027t mean anything! I only want to know—I want to know—I want—\" He stopped. \"What do you want?\" his father asked crossly. \"Why don\u0027t you say it? Don\u0027t make such a fuss.\" \"I\u0027m not—not at all,\" George declared, pushing his chair back from the table. \"You must finish your dinner, dear,\" his mother urged. \"Don\u0027t—\" \"I have finished. I\u0027ve eaten all I want. I don\u0027t want any more than I wanted. I don\u0027t want—I—\" He rose, still incoherent. \"I prefer— I want—Please excuse me!\" He left the room, and a moment later the screens outside the open front door were heard to slam: \"Fanny! You shouldn\u0027t—\" \"Isabel, don\u0027t reproach me, he did have plenty of dinner, and I only told the truth: everybody has been saying—\" \"But there isn\u0027t any truth in it.\" \"We don\u0027t actually know there isn\u0027t,\" Miss Fanny insisted, giggling. \"We\u0027ve never asked Lucy.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t ask her anything so absurd!\" \"George would,\" George\u0027s father remarked. \"That\u0027s what he\u0027s gone to do.\" Mr. Minafer was not mistaken: that was what his son had gone to do. Lucy and her father were just rising from their dinner table when the stirred youth arrived at the front door of the new house. It was a cottage, however, rather than a house; and Lucy had taken a free hand with the architect, achieving results in white and green, outside, and white and blue, inside, to such effect of youth and daintiness that her father complained of \"too much spring-time!\" The whole place, including his own bedroom, was a young damsel\u0027s boudoir, he said, so that nowhere could he smoke a cigar without feeling like a ruffian. However, he was smoking when George arrived, and he encouraged George to join him in the pastime, but the caller, whose air was both tense and preoccupied, declined with something like agitation. \"I never smoke—that is, I\u0027m seldom—I mean, no thanks,\" he said. \"I mean not at all. I\u0027d rather not.\" \"Aren\u0027t you well, George?\" Eugene asked, looking at him in perplexity. \"Have you been overworking at college? You do look rather pa—\" \"I don\u0027t work,\" said George. \"I mean I don\u0027t work. I think, but I don\u0027t work. I only work at the end of the term. There isn\u0027t much to do.\" Eugene\u0027s perplexity was little decreased, and a tinkle of the door-bell afforded him obvious relief. \"It\u0027s my foreman,\" he said, looking at his watch. \"I\u0027ll take him out in the yard to talk. This is no place for a foreman.\" And he departed, leaving the \"living room\" to Lucy and George. It was a pretty room, white panelled and blue curtained—and no place for a foreman, as Eugene said. There was a grand piano, and Lucy stood leaning back against it, looking intently at George, while her fingers, behind her, absently struck a chord or two. And her dress was the dress for that room, being of blue and white, too; and the high colour in her cheeks was far from interfering with the general harmony of things—George saw with dismay that she was prettier than ever, and naturally he missed the reassurance he might have felt had he been able to guess that Lucy, on her part, was finding him better looking than ever. For, however unusual the scope of George\u0027s pride, vanity of beauty was not included; he did not think about his looks. \"What\u0027s wrong, George?\" she asked softly. \"What do you mean: \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\" \"You\u0027re awfully upset about something. Didn\u0027t you get though your examination all right?\" \"Certainly I did. What makes you think anything\u0027s \u0027wrong\u0027 with me?\" \"You do look pale, as papa said, and it seemed to me that the way you talked sounded—well, a little confused.\" \"Confused\u0027! I said I didn\u0027t care to smoke. What in the world is confused about that?\" \"Nothing. But—\" \"See here!\" George stepped close to her. \"Are you glad to see me?\" \"You needn\u0027t be so fierce about it!\" Lucy protested, laughing at his dramatic intensity. \"Of course I am! How long have I been looking forward to it?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said sharply, abating nothing of his fierceness. \"How long have you?\" \"Why—ever since you went away!\" \"Is that true? Lucy, is that true?\" \"You are funny!\" she said. \"Of course it\u0027s true. Do tell me what\u0027s the matter with you, George!\" \"I will!\" he exclaimed. \"I was a boy when I saw you last. I see that now, though I didn\u0027t then. Well, I\u0027m not a boy any longer. I\u0027m a man, and a man has a right to demand a totally different treatment.\" \"Why has he?\" \"What?\" \"I don\u0027t seem to be able to understand you at all, George. Why shouldn\u0027t a boy be treated just as well as a man?\" George seemed to find himself at a loss. \"Why shouldn\u0027t—Well, he shouldn\u0027t, because a man has a right to certain explanations.\" \"What explanations?\" \"Whether he\u0027s been made a toy of!\" George almost shouted. \"That\u0027s what I want to know!\" Lucy shook her head despairingly. \"You are the queerest person! You say you\u0027re a man now, but you talk more like a boy than ever. What does make you so excited?\" \"\u0027Excited!\u0027\" he stormed. \"Do you dare to stand there and call me \u0027excited\u0027? I tell you, I never have been more calm or calmer in my life! I don\u0027t know that a person needs to be called \u0027excited\u0027 because he demands explanations that are his simple due!\" \"What in the world do you want me to explain?\" \"Your conduct with Fred Kinney!\" George shouted. Lucy uttered a sudden cry of laughter; she was delighted. \"It\u0027s been awful!\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know that I ever heard of worse misbehaviour! Papa and I have been twice to dinner with his family, and I\u0027ve been three times to church with Fred—and once to the circus! I don\u0027t know when they\u0027ll be here to arrest me!\" \"Stop that!\" George commanded fiercely. \"I want to know just one thing, and I mean to know it, too!\" \"Whether I enjoyed the circus?\" \"I want to know if you\u0027re engaged to him!\" \"No!\" she cried and lifting her face close to his for the shortest instant possible, she gave him a look half merry, half defiant, but all fond. It was an adorable look. \"Lucy!\" he said huskily. But she turned quickly from him, and ran to the other end of the room. He followed awkwardly, stammering: \"Lucy, I want—I want to ask you. Will you—will you—will you be engaged to me?\" She stood at a window, seeming to look out into the summer darkness, her back to him. \"Will you, Lucy?\" \"No,\" she murmured, just audibly. \"Why not?\" \"I\u0027m older than you.\" \"Eight months!\" \"You\u0027re too young.\" \"Is that—\" he said, gulping—\"is that the only reason you won\u0027t?\" She did not answer. As she stood, persistently staring out of the window, with her back to him, she did not see how humble his attitude had become; but his voice was low, and it shook so that she could have no doubt of his emotion. \"Lucy, please forgive me for making such a row,\" he said, thus gently. \"I\u0027ve been—I\u0027ve been terribly upset—terribly! You know how I feel about you, and always have felt about you. I\u0027ve shown it in every single thing I\u0027ve done since the first time I met you, and I know you know it. Don\u0027t you?\" Still she did not move or speak. \"Is the only reason you won\u0027t be engaged to me you think I\u0027m too young, Lucy?\" \"It\u0027s—it\u0027s reason enough,\" she said faintly. At that he caught one of her hands, and she turned to him: there were tears in her eyes, tears which he did not understand at all. \"Lucy, you little dear!\" he cried. \"I knew you—\" \"No, no!\" she said, and she pushed him away, withdrawing her hand. \"George, let\u0027s not talk of solemn things.\" \"Solemn things!\u0027 Like what?\" \"Like—being engaged.\" But George had become altogether jubilant, and he laughed triumphantly. \"Good gracious, that isn\u0027t solemn!\" \"It is, too!\" she said, wiping her eyes. \"It\u0027s too solemn for us.\" \"No, it isn\u0027t! I—\" \"Let\u0027s sit down and be sensible, dear,\" she said. \"You sit over there—\" \"I will if you\u0027ll call me, \u0027dear\u0027 again.\" \"No,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll only call you that once again this summer—the night before you go away.\" \"That will have to do, then,\" he laughed, \"so long as I know we\u0027re engaged.\" \"But we\u0027re not!\" she protested. \"And we never will be, if you don\u0027t promise not to speak of it again until—until I tell you to!\" \"I won\u0027t promise that,\" said the happy George. \"I\u0027ll only promise not to speak of it till the next time you call me \u0027dear\u0027; and you\u0027ve promised to call me that the night before I leave for my senior year.\" \"Oh, but I didn\u0027t!\" she said earnestly, then hesitated. \"Did I?\" \"Didn\u0027t you?\" \"I don\u0027t think I meant it,\" she murmured, her wet lashes flickering above troubled eyes. \"I know one thing about you,\" he said gayly, his triumph increasing. \"You never went back on anything you said, yet, and I\u0027m not afraid of this being the first time!\" \"But we mustn\u0027t let—\" she faltered; then went on tremulously, \"George, we\u0027ve got on so well together, we won\u0027t let this make a difference between us, will we?\" And she joined in his laughter. \"It will all depend on what you tell me the night before I go away. You agree we\u0027re going to settle things then, don\u0027t you, Lucy?\" \"I don\u0027t promise.\" \"Yes, you do! Don\u0027t you?\" \"Well—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677/49433.html","bookId":1175,"book":{"id":1175,"title":"The Magnificent Ambersons 安伯森情史","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM"}}
