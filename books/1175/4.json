{"id":16139,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"Until he reached the age of twelve, Georgie\u0027s education was a domestic process; tutors came to the house; and those citizens who yearned for his taking down often said: \"Just wait till he has to go to public school; then he\u0027ll get it!\" But at twelve Georgie was sent to a private school in the town, and there came from this small and dependent institution no report, or even rumour, of Georgie\u0027s getting anything that he was thought to deserve; therefore the yearning still persisted, though growing gaunt with feeding upon itself. For, although Georgie\u0027s pomposities and impudence in the little school were often almost unbearable, the teachers were fascinated by him. They did not like him—he was too arrogant for that—but he kept them in such a state of emotion that they thought more about him than they did about all of the other ten pupils. The emotion he kept them in was usually one resulting from injured self-respect, but sometimes it was dazzled admiration. So far as their conscientious observation went, he \"studied\" his lessons sparingly; but sometimes, in class, he flashed an admirable answer, with a comprehension not often shown by the pupils they taught; and he passed his examinations easily. In all, without discernible effort, he acquired at this school some rudiments of a liberal education and learned nothing whatever about himself. The yearners were still yearning when Georgie, at sixteen, was sent away to a great \"Prep School.\" \"Now,\" they said brightly, \"he\u0027ll get it! He\u0027ll find himself among boys just as important in their home towns as he is, and they\u0027ll knock the stuffing out of him when he puts on his airs with them! Oh, but that would be worth something to see!\" They were mistaken, it appeared, for when Georgie returned, a few months later, he still seemed to have the same stuffing. He had been deported by the authorities, the offense being stated as \"insolence and profanity\"; in fact, he had given the principal of the school instructions almost identical with those formerly objected to by the Reverend Malloch Smith. But he had not got his come-upance, and those who counted upon it were embittered by his appearance upon the down-town streets driving a dog-cart at criminal speed, making pedestrians retreat from the crossings, and behaving generally as if he \"owned the earth.\" A disgusted hardware dealer of middle age, one of those who hungered for Georgie\u0027s downfall, was thus driven back upon the sidewalk to avoid being run over, and so far forgot himself as to make use of the pet street insult of the year: \"Got \u0027ny sense! See here, bub, does your mother know you\u0027re out?\" Georgie, without even seeming to look at him, flicked the long lash of his whip dexterously, and a little spurt of dust came from the hardware man\u0027s trousers, not far below the waist. He was not made of hardware: he raved, looking for a missile; then, finding none, commanded himself sufficiently to shout after the rapid dog-cart: \"Turn down your pants, you would-be dude! Raining in dear ole Lunnon! Git off the earth!\" Georgie gave him no encouragement to think that he was heard. The dog-cart turned the next corner, causing indignation there, likewise, and, having proceeded some distance farther, halted in front of the \"Amberson Block\"—an old-fashioned four-story brick warren of lawyers offices, insurance and realestate offices, with a \"drygoods store\" occupying the ground floor. Georgie tied his lathered trotter to a telegraph pole, and stood for a moment looking at the building critically: it seemed shabby, and he thought his grandfather ought to replace it with a fourteen-story skyscraper, or even a higher one, such as he had lately seen in New York—when he stopped there for a few days of recreation and rest on his way home from the bereaved school. About the entryway to the stairs were various tin signs, announcing the occupation and location of upper-floor tenants, and Georgie decided to take some of these with him if he should ever go to college. However, he did not stop to collect them at this time, but climbed the worn stairs—there was no elevator—to the fourth floor, went down a dark corridor, and rapped three times upon a door. It was a mysterious door, its upper half, of opaque glass, bearing no sign to state the business or profession of the occupants within; but overhead, upon the lintel, four letters had been smearingly inscribed, partly with purple ink and partly with a soft lead pencil, \"F. O. T. A.\" and upon the plaster wall, above the lintel, there was a drawing dear to male adolescence: a skull and crossbones. Three raps, similar to Georgie\u0027s, sounded from within the room. Georgie then rapped four times the rapper within the room rapped twice, and Georgie rapped seven times. This ended precautionary measures; and a well-dressed boy of sixteen opened the door; whereupon Georgie entered quickly, and the door was closed behind him. Seven boys of congenial age were seated in a semicircular row of damaged office chairs, facing a platform whereon stood a solemn, red-haired young personage with a table before him. At one end of the room there was a battered sideboard, and upon it were some empty beer bottles, a tobacco can about two-thirds full, with a web of mold over the surface of the tobacco, a dusty cabinet photograph (not inscribed) of Miss Lillian Russell, several withered old pickles, a caseknife, and a half-petrified section of icing-cake on a sooty plate. At the other end of the room were two rickety card-tables and a stand of bookshelves where were displayed under dust four or five small volumes of M. Guy de Maupassant\u0027s stories, \"Robinson Crusoe,\" \"Sappho,\" \"Mr. Barnes of New York,\" a work by Giovanni Boccaccio, a Bible, \"The Arabian Nights\u0027 Entertainment,\" \"Studies of the Human Form Divine,\" \"The Little Minister,\" and a clutter of monthly magazines and illustrated weeklies of about that crispness one finds in such articles upon a doctor\u0027s ante-room table. Upon the wall, above the sideboard, was an old framed lithograph of Miss Della Fox in \"Wang\"; over the bookshelves there was another lithograph purporting to represent Mr. John L. Sullivan in a boxing costume, and beside it a halftone reproduction of \"A Reading From Horner.\" The final decoration consisted of damaged papiermache—a round shield with two battle-axes and two cross-hilted swords, upon the wall over the little platform where stood the red-haired presiding officer. He addressed Georgie in a serious voice: \"Welcome, Friend of the Ace.\" \"Welcome, Friend of the Ace,\" Georgie responded, and all of the other boys repeated the words, \"Welcome, Friend of the Ace.\" \"Take your seat in the secret semicircle,\" said the presiding officer. \"We will now proceed to—\" But Georgie was disposed to be informal. He interrupted, turning to the boy who had admitted him: \"Look here, Charlie Johnson, what\u0027s Fred Kinney doing in the president\u0027s chair? That\u0027s my place, isn\u0027t it? What you men been up to here, anyhow? Didn\u0027t you all agree I was to be president just the same, even if I was away at school?\" \"Well—\" said Charlie Johnson uneasily. \"Listen! I didn\u0027t have much to do with it. Some of the other members thought that long as you weren\u0027t in town or anything, and Fred gave the sideboard, why—\" Mr. Kinney, presiding, held in his hand, in lieu of a gavel, and considered much more impressive, a Civil War relic known as a \"horse-pistol.\" He rapped loudly for order. \"All Friends of the Ace will take their seats!\" he said sharply. \"I\u0027m president of the F. O. T. A. now, George Minafer, and don\u0027t you forget it! You and Charlie Johnson sit down, because I was elected perfectly fair, and we\u0027re goin\u0027 to hold a meeting here.\" \"Oh, you are, are you?\" said George skeptically. Charlie Johnson thought to mollify him. \"Well, didn\u0027t we call this meeting just especially because you told us to? You said yourself we ought to have a kind of celebration because you\u0027ve got back to town, George, and that\u0027s what we\u0027re here for now, and everything. What do you care about being president? All it amounts to is just calling the roll and—\" The president de facto hammered the table. \"This meeting will now proceed to—\" \"No, it won\u0027t,\" said George, and he advanced to the desk, laughing contemptuously. \"Get off that platform.\" \"This meeting will come to order!\" Mr. Kinney commanded fiercely. \"You put down that gavel,\" said George. \"Whose is it, I\u0027d like to know? It belongs to my grandfather, and you quit hammering it that way or you\u0027ll break it, and I\u0027ll have to knock your head off.\" \"This meeting will come to order! I was legally elected here, and I\u0027m not going to be bulldozed!\" \"All right,\" said Georgie. \"You\u0027re president. Now we\u0027ll hold another election.\" \"We will not!\" Fred Kinney shouted. \"We\u0027ll have our reg\u0027lar meeting, and then we\u0027ll play euchre \u0026 nickel a corner, what we\u0027re here for. This meeting will now come to ord—\" Georgie addressed the members. \"I\u0027d like to know who got up this thing in the first place,\" he said. \"Who\u0027s the founder of the F.O.T.A., if you please? Who got this room rent free? Who got the janitor to let us have most of this furniture? You suppose you could keep this clubroom a minute if I told my grandfather I didn\u0027t want it for a literary club any more? I\u0027d like to say a word on how you members been acting, too! When I went away I said I didn\u0027t care if you had a vice-president or something while I was gone, but here I hardly turned my back and you had to go and elect Fred Kinney president! Well, if that\u0027s what you want, you can have it. I was going to have a little celebration down here some night pretty soon, and bring some port wine, like we drink at school in our crowd there, and I was going to get my grandfather to give the club an extra room across the hall, and prob\u0027ly I could get my Uncle George to give us his old billiard table, because he\u0027s got a new one, and the club could put it in the other room. Well, you got a new president now!\" Here Georgie moved toward the door and his tone became plaintive, though undeniably there was disdain beneath his sorrow. \"I guess all I better do is—resign!\" And he opened the door, apparently intending to withdraw. \"All in favour of having a new election,\" Charlie Johnson shouted hastily, \"say, \u0027Aye\u0027!\" \"Aye\" was said by everyone present except Mr. Kinney, who began a hot protest, but it was immediately smothered. \"All in favour of me being president instead of Fred Kinney,\" shouted Georgie, \"say \u0027Aye.\u0027 The \u0027Ayes\u0027 have it!\" \"I resign,\" said the red-headed boy, gulping as he descended from the platform. \"I resign from the club!\" Hot-eyed, he found his hat and departed, jeers echoing after him as he plunged down the corridor. Georgie stepped upon the platform, and took up the emblem of office. \"Ole red-head Fred\u0027ll be around next week,\" said the new chairman. \"He\u0027ll be around boot-lickin\u0027 to get us to take him back in again, but I guess we don\u0027t want him: that fellow always was a trouble-maker. We will now proceed with our meeting. Well, fellows, I suppose you want to hear from your president. I don\u0027t know that I have much to say, as I have already seen most of you a few times since I got back. I had a good time at the old school, back East, but had a little trouble with the faculty and came on home. My family stood by me as well as I could ask, and I expect to stay right here in the old town until whenever I decide to enter college. Now, I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any more business before the meeting. I guess we might as well play cards. Anybody that\u0027s game for a little quarter-limit poker or any limit they say, why I\u0027d like to have \u0027em sit at the president\u0027s card- table.\" When the diversions of the Friends of the Ace were concluded for that afternoon, Georgie invited his chief supporter, Mr. Charlie Johnson, to drive home with him to dinner, and as they jingled up National Avenue in the dog-cart, Charlie asked: \"What sort of men did you run up against at that school, George?\" \"Best crowd there: finest set of men I ever met.\" \"How\u0027d you get in with \u0027em?\" Georgie laughed. \"I let them get in with me, Charlie,\" he said in a tone of gentle explanation. \"It\u0027s vulgar to do any other way. Did I tell you the nickname they gave me—\u0027King\u0027? That was what they called me at that school, \u0027King Minafer.\" \"How\u0027d they happen to do that?\" his friend asked innocently. \"Oh, different things,\" George answered lightly. \"Of course, any of \u0027em that came from anywhere out in this part the country knew about the family and all that, and so I suppose it was a good deal on account of—oh, on account of the family and the way I do things, most likely.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677/49424.html","bookId":1175,"book":{"id":1175,"title":"The Magnificent Ambersons 安伯森情史","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM"}}
