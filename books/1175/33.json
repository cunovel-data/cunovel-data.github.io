{"id":16168,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"At least, it may be claimed for George that his last night in the house where he had been born was not occupied with his own disheartening future, but with sorrow for what sacrifices his pride and youth had demanded of others. And early in the morning he came downstairs and tried to help Fanny make coffee on the kitchen range. \"There was something I wanted to say to you last night, Aunt Fanny,\" he said, as she finally discovered that an amber fluid, more like tea than coffee, was as near ready to be taken into the human system as it would ever be. \"I think I\u0027d better do it now.\" She set the coffee-pot back upon the stove with a little crash, and, looking at him in a desperate anxiety, began to twist her dainty apron between her fingers without any consciousness of what she was doing. \"Why—why—\" she stammered; but she knew what he was going to say, and that was why she had been more and more nervous. \"Hadn\u0027t—perhaps— perhaps we\u0027d better get the—the things moved to the little new home first, George. Let\u0027s—\" He interrupted quietly, though at her phrase, \"the little new home,\" his pungent impulse was to utter one loud shout and run. \"It was about this new place that I wanted to speak. I\u0027ve been thinking it over, and I\u0027ve decided. I want you to take all the things from mother\u0027s room and use them and keep them for me, and I\u0027m sure the little apartment will be just what you like; and with the extra bedroom probably you could find some woman friend to come and live there, and share the expense with you. But I\u0027ve decided on another arrangement for myself, and so I\u0027m not going with you. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ll mind much, and I don\u0027t see why you should mind— particularly, that is. I\u0027m not very lively company these days, or any days, for that matter. I can\u0027t imagine you, or any one else, being much attached to me, so—\" He stopped in amazement: no chair had been left in the kitchen, but Fanny gave a despairing glance around her, in search of one, then sank abruptly, and sat flat upon the floor. \"You\u0027re going to leave me in the lurch!\" she gasped. \"What on earth—\" George sprang to her. \"Get up, Aunt Fanny!\" \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027m too weak. Let me alone, George!\" And as he released the wrist he had seized to help her, she repeated the dismal prophecy which for days she had been matching against her hopes: \"You\u0027re going to leave me—in the lurch!\" \"Why no, Aunt Fanny!\" he protested. \"At first I\u0027d have been something of a burden on you. I\u0027m to get eight dollars a week; about thirty-two a month. The rent\u0027s thirty-six dollars a month, and the table-d\u0027hote dinner runs up to over twenty-two dollars apiece, so with my half of the rent—eighteen dollars—I\u0027d have less than nothing left out of my salary to pay my share of the groceries for all the breakfasts and luncheons. You see you\u0027d not only be doing all the housework and cooking, but you\u0027d be paying more of the expenses than I would.\" She stared at him with such a forlorn blankness as he had never seen. \"I\u0027d be paying—\" she said feebly. \"I\u0027d be paying—\" \"Certainly you would. You\u0027d be using more of your money than—\" \"My money!\" Fanny\u0027s chin drooped upon her thin chest, and she laughed miserably. \"I\u0027ve got twenty-eight dollars. That\u0027s all.\" \"You mean until the interest is due again?\" \"I mean that\u0027s all,\" Fanny said. \"I mean that\u0027s all there is. There won\u0027t be any more interest because there isn\u0027t any principal.\" \"Why, you told—\" She shook her head. \"No, I haven\u0027t told you anything.\" \"Then it was Uncle George. He told me you had enough to fall back on. That\u0027s just what he said: \u0027to fall back on.\u0027 He said you\u0027d lost more than you should, in the headlight company, but he\u0027d insisted that you should hold out enough to live on, and you\u0027d very wisely followed his advice.\" \"I know,\" she said weakly. \"I told him so. He didn\u0027t know, or else he\u0027d forgotten, how much Wilbur\u0027s insurance amounted to, and I—oh, it seemed such a sure way to make a real fortune out of a little—and I thought I could do something for you, George, if you ever came to need it—and it all looked so bright I just thought I\u0027d put it all in. I did—every cent except my last interest payment—and it\u0027s gone.\" \"Good Lord!\" George began to pace up and down on the worn planks of the bare floor. \"Why on earth did you wait till now to tell such a thing as this?\" \"I couldn\u0027t tell till I had to,\" she said piteously. \"I couldn\u0027t till George Amberson went away. He couldn\u0027t do anything to help, anyhow, and I just didn\u0027t want him to talk to me about it—he\u0027s been at me so much about not putting more in than I could afford to lose, and said he considered he had my—my word I wasn\u0027t putting more than that in it. So I thought: What was the use? What was the use of going over it all with him and having him reproach me, and probably reproach himself? It wouldn\u0027t do any good—not any good on earth.\" She got out her lace handkerchief and began to cry. \"Nothing does any good, I guess, in this old world. Oh, how tired of this old world I am! I didn\u0027t know what to do. I just tried to go ahead and be as practical as I could, and arrange some way for us to live. Oh, I knew you didn\u0027t want me, George! You always teased me and berated me whenever you had a chance from the time you were a little boy—you did so! Later, you\u0027ve tried to be kinder to me, but you don\u0027t want me around— oh, I can see that much! You don\u0027t suppose I want to thrust myself on you, do you? It isn\u0027t very pleasant to be thrusting yourself on a person you know doesn\u0027t want you—but I knew you oughtn\u0027t to be left all alone in the world; it isn\u0027t good. I knew your mother\u0027d want me to watch over you and try to have something like a home for you—I know she\u0027d want me to do what I tried to do!\" Fanny\u0027s tears were bitter now, and her voice, hoarse and wet, was tragically sincere. \"I tried—I tried to be practical—to look after your interests—to make things as nice for you as I could—I walked my heels down looking for a place for us to live—I walked and walked over this town—I didn\u0027t ride one block on a street-car—I wouldn\u0027t use five cents no matter how tired I—Oh!\" She sobbed uncontrollably. \"Oh! and now—you don\u0027t want—you want—you want to leave me in the lurch! You—\" George stopped walking. \"In God\u0027s name, Aunt Fanny,\" he said, \"quit spreading out your handkerchief and drying it and then getting it all wet again! I mean stop crying! Do! And for heaven\u0027s sake, get up. Don\u0027t sit there with your back against the boiler and—\" \"It\u0027s not hot,\" Fanny sniffled. \"It\u0027s cold; the; plumbers disconnected it. I wouldn\u0027t mind if they hadn\u0027t. I wouldn\u0027t mind if it burned me, George.\" \"Oh, my Lord!\" He went to her, and lifted her. \"For God\u0027s sake, get up! Come, let\u0027s take the coffee into the other room, and see what\u0027s to be done.\" He got her to her feet; she leaned upon him, already somewhat comforted, and, with his arm about her, he conducted her to the dining room and seated her in one of the two kitchen chairs which had been placed at the rough table. \"There!\" he said, \"get over it!\" Then he brought the coffee-pot, some lumps of sugar in a tin pan, and, finding that all the coffee-cups were broken, set water glasses upon the table, and poured some of the pale coffee into them. By this time Fanny\u0027s spirits had revived appreciably: she looked up with a plaintive eagerness. \"I had bought all my fall clothes, George,\" she said; \"and I paid every bill I owed. I don\u0027t owe a cent for clothes, George.\" \"That\u0027s good,\" he said wanly, and he had a moment of physical dizziness that decided him to sit down quickly. For an instant it seemed to him that he was not Fanny\u0027s nephew, but married to her. He passed his pale hand over his paler forehead. \"Well, let\u0027s see where we stand,\" he said feebly. \"Let\u0027s see if we can afford this place you\u0027ve selected.\" Fanny continued to brighten. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s the most practical plan we could possibly have worked out, George—and it is a comfort to be among nice people. I think we\u0027ll both enjoy it, because the truth is we\u0027ve been keeping too much to ourselves for a long while. It isn\u0027t good for people.\" \"I was thinking about the money, Aunt Fanny. You see—\" \"I\u0027m sure we can manage it,\" she interrupted quickly. \"There really isn\u0027t a cheaper place in town that we could actually live in and be—\" Here she interrupted herself. \"Oh! There\u0027s one great economy I forgot to tell you, and it\u0027s especially an economy for you, because you\u0027re always too generous about such things: they don\u0027t allow any tipping. They have signs that prohibit it.\" \"That\u0027s good,\" he said grimly. \"But the rent is thirty-six dollars a month; the dinner is twenty-two and a half for each of us, and we\u0027ve got to have some provision for other food. We won\u0027t need any clothes for a year, perhaps—\" \"Oh, longer!\" she exclaimed. \"So you see—\" \"I see that forty-five and thirty-six make eighty-one,\" he said. \"At the lowest, we need a hundred dollars a month—and I\u0027m going to make thirty-two.\" \"I thought of that, George,\" she said confidently, \"and I\u0027m sure it will be all right. You\u0027ll be earning a great deal more than that very soon.\" \"I don\u0027t see any prospect of it—not till I\u0027m admitted to the bar, and that will be two years at the earliest.\" Fanny\u0027s confidence was not shaken. \"I know you\u0027ll be getting on faster than—\" \"Faster?\" George echoed gravely. \"We\u0027ve got to have more than that to start with.\" \"Well, there\u0027s the six hundred dollars from the sale. Six hundred and twelve dollars it was.\" \"It isn\u0027t six hundred and twelve now,\" said George. \"It\u0027s about one hundred and sixty.\" Fanny showed a momentary dismay. \"Why, how—\" \"I lent Uncle George two hundred; I gave fifty apiece to old Sam and those two other old darkies that worked for grandfather so long, and ten to each of the servants here—\" \"And you gave me thirty-six,\" she said thoughtfully, \"for the first month\u0027s rent, in advance.\" \"Did I? I\u0027d forgotten. Well, with about a hundred and sixty in bank and our expenses a hundred a month, it doesn\u0027t seem as if this new place—\" \"Still,\" she interrupted, \"we have paid the first month\u0027s rent in advance, and it does seem to be the most practical—\" George rose. \"See here, Aunt Fanny,\" he said decisively. \"You stay here and look after the moving. Old Frank doesn\u0027t expect me until afternoon, this first day, but I\u0027ll go and see him now.\" It was early, and old Frank, just established at his big, flat-topped desk, was surprised when his prospective assistant and pupil walked in. He was pleased, as well as surprised, however, and rose, offering a cordial old hand. \"The real flare!\" he said. \"The real flare for the law. That\u0027s right! Couldn\u0027t wait till afternoon to begin! I\u0027m delighted that you—\" \"I wanted to say—\" George began, but his patron cut him off. \"Wait just a minute, my boy. I\u0027ve prepared a little speech of welcome, and even though you\u0027re five hours ahead of time, I mean to deliver it. First of all, your grandfather was my old war-comrade and my best client; for years I prospered through my connection with his business, and his grandson is welcome in my office and to my best efforts in his behalf. But I want to confess, Georgie, that during your earlier youth I may have had some slight feeling of—well, prejudice, not altogether in your favour; but whatever slight feeling it was, it began to vanish on that afternoon, a good while ago, when you stood up to your Aunt Amelia Amberson as you did in the Major\u0027s library, and talked to her as a man and a gentleman should. I saw then what good stuff was in you—and I always wanted to mention it. If my prejudice hadn\u0027t altogether vanished after that, the last vestiges disappeared during these trying times that have come upon you this past year, when I have been a witness to the depth of feeling you\u0027ve shown and your quiet consideration for your grandfather and for everyone else around you. I just want to add that I think you\u0027ll find an honest pleasure now in industry and frugality that wouldn\u0027t have come to you in a more frivolous career. The law is a jealous mistress and a stern mistress, but a—\" George had stood before him in great and increasing embarrassment; and he was unable to allow the address to proceed to its conclusion. \"I can\u0027t do it!\" he burst out. \"I can\u0027t take her for my mistress.\" \"What?\" \"I\u0027ve come to tell you, I\u0027ve got to find something that\u0027s quicker. I can\u0027t—\" Old Frank got a little red. \"Let\u0027s sit down,\" he said. \"What\u0027s the trouble?\" George told him. The old gentleman listened sympathetically, only murmuring: \"Well, well!\" from time to time, and nodding acquiescence. \"You see she\u0027s set her mind on this apartment,\" George explained. \"She\u0027s got some old cronies there, and I guess she\u0027s been looking forward to the games of bridge and the kind of harmless gossip that goes on in such places. Really, it\u0027s a life she\u0027d like better than anything else—better than that she\u0027s lived at home, I really believe. It struck me she\u0027s just about got to have it, and after all she could hardly have anything less.\" \"This comes pretty heavily upon me, you know,\" said old Frank. \"I got her into that headlight company, and she fooled me about her resources as much as she did your Uncle George. I was never your father\u0027s adviser, if you remember, and when the insurance was turned over to her some other lawyer arranged it—probably your father\u0027s. But it comes pretty heavily on me, and I feel a certain responsibility.\" \"Not at all. I\u0027m taking the responsibility.\" And George smiled with one corner of his mouth. \"She\u0027s not your aunt, you know, sir.\" \"Well, I\u0027m unable to see, even if she\u0027s yours, that a young man is morally called upon to give up a career at the law to provide his aunt with a favourable opportunity to play bridge whist!\" \"No,\" George agreed. \"But I haven\u0027t begun my \u0027career at the law\u0027 so it can\u0027t be said I\u0027m making any considerable sacrifice. I\u0027ll tell you how it is, sir.\" He flushed, and, looking out of the streaked and smoky window beside which he was sitting, spoke with difficulty. \"I feel as if—as if perhaps I had one or two pretty important things in my life to make up for. Well, I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t make them up to—to whom I would. It\u0027s struck me that, as I couldn\u0027t, I might be a little decent to somebody else, perhaps—if I could manage it! I never have been particularly decent to poor old Aunt Fanny.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know: I shouldn\u0027t say that. A little youthful teasing—I doubt if she\u0027s minded so much. She felt your father\u0027s death terrifically, of course, but it seems to me she\u0027s had a fairly comfortable life-up to now—if she was disposed to take it that way.\" \"But \u0027up to now\u0027 is the important thing,\" George said. \"Now is now— and you see I can\u0027t wait two years to be admitted to the bar and begin to practice. I\u0027ve got to start in at something else that pays from the start, and that\u0027s what I\u0027ve come to you about. I have an idea, you see.\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad of that!\" said old Frank, smiling. \"I can\u0027t think of anything just at this minute that pays from the start.\" \"I only know of one thing, myself.\" \"What is it?\" George flushed again, but managed to laugh at his own embarrassment. \"I suppose I\u0027m about as ignorant of business as anybody in the world,\" he said. \"But I\u0027ve heard they pay very high wages to people in dangerous trades; I\u0027ve always heard they did, and I\u0027m sure it must be true. I mean people that handle touchy chemicals or high explosives— men in dynamite factories, or who take things of that sort about the country in wagons, and shoot oil wells. I thought I\u0027d see if you couldn\u0027t tell me something more about it, or else introduce me to someone who could, and then I thought I\u0027d see if I couldn\u0027t get something of the kind to do as soon as possible. My nerves are good; I\u0027m muscular, and I\u0027ve got a steady hand; it seemed to me that this was about the only line of work in the world that I\u0027m fitted for. I wanted to get started to-day if I could.\" Old Frank gave him a long stare. At first this scrutiny was sharply incredulous; then it was grave; finally it developed into a threat of overwhelming laughter; a forked vein in his forehead became more visible and his eyes seemed about to protrude. But he controlled his impulse; and, rising, took up his hat and overcoat. \"All right,\" he said. \"If you\u0027ll promise not to get blown up, I\u0027ll go with you to see if we can find the job.\" Then, meaning what he said, but amazed that he did mean it, he added: \"You certainly are the most practical young man I ever met!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677/49453.html","bookId":1175,"book":{"id":1175,"title":"The Magnificent Ambersons 安伯森情史","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM"}}
