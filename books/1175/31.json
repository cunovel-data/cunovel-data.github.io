{"id":16166,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"Major Amberson remained dry-eyed through the time that followed: he knew that this separation from his daughter would be short, that the separation which had preceded it was the long one. He worked at his ledgers no more under his old gas drop-light, but would sit all evening staring into the fire, in his bedroom, and not speaking unless someone asked him a question. He seemed almost unaware of what went on around him, and those who were with him thought him dazed by Isabel\u0027s death, guessing that he was lost in reminiscences and vague dreams. \"Probably his mind is full of pictures of his youth, or the Civil War, and the days when he and mother were young married people and all of us children were jolly little things—and the city was a small town with one cobbled street and the others just dirt roads with board sidewalks.\" This was George Amberson\u0027s conjecture, and the others agreed; but they were mistaken. The Major was engaged in the profoundest thinking of his life. No business plans which had ever absorbed him could compare in momentousness with the plans that absorbed him now, for he had to plan how to enter the unknown country where he was not even sure of being recognized as an Amberson—not sure of anything, except that Isabel would help him if she could. His absorption produced the outward effect of reverie, but of course it was not. The Major was occupied with the first really important matter that had taken his attention since he came home invalided, after the Gettysburg campaign, and went into business; and he realized that everything which had worried him or delighted him during this lifetime between then and to-day—all his buying and building and trading and banking—that it all was trifling and waste beside what concerned him now. He seldom went out of his room, and often left untouched the meals they brought to him there; and this neglect caused them to shake their heads mournfully, again mistaking for dazedness the profound concentration of his mind. Meanwhile, the life of the little bereft group still forlornly centering upon him began to pick up again, as life will, and to emerge from its own period of dazedness. It was not Isabel\u0027s father but her son who was really dazed. A month after her death he walked abruptly into Fanny\u0027s room, one night, and found her at her desk, eagerly adding columns of figures with which she had covered several sheets of paper. This mathematical computation was concerned with her future income to be produced by the electric headlight, now just placed on the general market; but Fanny was ashamed to be discovered doing anything except mourning, and hastily pushed the sheets aside, even as she looked over her shoulder to greet her hollow-eyed visitor. \"George! You startled me.\" \"I beg your pardon for not knocking,\" he said huskily. \"I didn\u0027t think.\" She turned in her chair and looked at him solicitously. \"Sit down, George, won\u0027t you?\" \"No. I just wanted—\" \"I could hear you walking up and down in your room,\" said Fanny. \"You were doing it ever since dinner, and it seems to me you\u0027re at it almost every evening. I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s good for you—and I know it would worry your mother terribly if she—\" Fanny hesitated. \"See here,\" George said, breathing fast, \"I want to tell you once more that what I did was right. How could I have done anything else but what I did do?\" \"About what, George?\" \"About everything!\" he exclaimed; and he became vehement. \"I did the right thing, I tell you! In heaven\u0027s name, I\u0027d like to know what else there was for anybody in my position to do! It would have been a dreadful thing for me to just let matters go on and not interfere—it would have been terrible! What else on earth was there for me to do? I had to stop that talk, didn\u0027t I? Could a son do less than I did? Didn\u0027t it cost me something to do it? Lucy and I\u0027d had a quarrel, but that would have come round in time—and it meant the end forever when I turned her father back from our door. I knew what it meant, yet I went ahead and did it because knew it had to be done if the talk was to be stopped. I took mother away for the same reason. I knew that would help to stop it. And she was happy over there—she was perfectly happy. I tell you, I think she had a happy life, and that\u0027s my only consolation. She didn\u0027t live to be old; she was still beautiful and young looking, and I feel she\u0027d rather have gone before she got old. She\u0027d had a good husband, and all the comfort and luxury that anybody could have—and how could it be called anything but a happy life? She was always cheerful, and when I think of her I can always see her laughing—I can always hear that pretty laugh of hers. When I can keep my mind off of the trip home, and that last night, I always think of her gay and laughing. So how on earth could she have had anything but a happy life? People that aren\u0027t happy don\u0027t look cheerful all the time, do they? They look unhappy if they are unhappy; that\u0027s how they look! See here\"—he faced her challengingly —\"do you deny that I did the right thing?\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t pretend to judge,\" Fanny said soothingly, for his voice and gesture both partook of wildness. \"I know you think you did, George.\" \"Think I did!\" he echoed violently. \"My God in heaven!\" And he began to walk up and down the floor. \"What else was there to do? What, choice did I have? Was there any other way of stopping the talk?\" He stopped, close in front of her, gesticulating, his voice harsh and loud: \"Don\u0027t you hear me? I\u0027m asking you: Was there any other way on earth of protecting her from the talk?\" Miss Fanny looked away. \"It died down before long, I think,\" she said nervously. \"That shows I was right, doesn\u0027t it?\" he cried. \"If I hadn\u0027t acted as I did, that slanderous old Johnson woman would have kept on with her slanders—she\u0027d still be—\" \"No,\" Fanny interrupted. \"She\u0027s dead. She dropped dead with apoplexy one day about six weeks after you left. I didn\u0027t mention it in my letters because I didn\u0027t want—I thought—\" \"Well, the other people would have kept on, then. They\u0027d have—\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Fanny, still averting her troubled eyes. \"Things are so changed here, George. The other people you speak of—one hardly knows what\u0027s become of them. Of course not a great many were doing the talking, and they—well, some of them are dead, and some might as well be—you never see them any more—and the rest, whoever they were, are probably so mixed in with the crowds of new people that seem never even to have heard of us—and I\u0027m sure we certainly never heard of them—and people seem to forget things so soon—they seem to forget anything. You can\u0027t imagine how things have changed here!\" George gulped painfully before he could speak. \"You—you mean to sit there and tell me that if I\u0027d just let things go on—Oh!\" He swung away, walking the floor again. \"I tell you I did the only right thing! If you don\u0027t think so, why in the name of heaven can\u0027t you say what else I should have done? It\u0027s easy enough to criticize, but the person who criticizes a man ought at least to tell him what else he should have done! You think I was wrong!\" \"I\u0027m not saying so,\" she said. \"You did at the time!\" he cried. \"You said enough then, I think! Well, what have you to say now, if you\u0027re so sure I was wrong?\" \"Nothing, George.\" \"It\u0027s only because you\u0027re afraid to!\" he said, and he went on with a sudden bitter divination: \"You\u0027re reproaching yourself with what you had to do with all that; and you\u0027re trying to make up for it by doing and saying what you think mother would want you to, and you think I couldn\u0027t stand it if I got to thinking I might have done differently. Oh, I know! That\u0027s exactly what\u0027s in your mind: you do think I was wrong! So does Uncle George. I challenged him about it the other day, and he answered just as you\u0027re answering—evaded, and tried to be gentler I don\u0027t care to be handled with gloves! I tell you I was right, and I don\u0027t need any coddling by people that think I wasn\u0027t! And I suppose you believe I was wrong not to let Morgan see her that last night when he came here, and she—she was dying. If you do, why in the name of God did you come and ask me? You could have taken him in! She did want to see him. She—\" Miss Fanny looked startled. \"You think—\" \"She told me so!\" And the tortured young man choked. \"She said— \u0027just once.\u0027 She said \u0027I\u0027d like to have seen him—just once!\u0027 She meant—to tell him good-bye! That\u0027s what she meant! And you put this on me, too; you put this responsibility on me! But I tell you, and I told Uncle George, that the responsibility isn\u0027t all mine! If you were so sure I was wrong all the time—when I took her away, and when I turned Morgan out—if you were so sure, what did you let me do it for? You and Uncle George were grown people, both of you, weren\u0027t you? You were older than I, and if you were so sure you were wiser than I, why did you just stand around with your hands hanging down, and let me go ahead? You could have stopped it if it was wrong, couldn\u0027t you?\" Fanny shook her head. \"No, George,\" she said slowly. \"Nobody could have stopped you. You were too strong, and—\" \"And what?\" he demanded loudly. \"And she loved you—too well.\" George stared at her hard, then his lower lip began to move convulsively, and he set his teeth upon it but could not check its frantic twitching. He ran out of the room. She sat still, listening. He had plunged into his mother\u0027s room, but no sound came to Fanny\u0027s ears after the sharp closing of the door; and presently she rose and stepped out into the hall—but could hear nothing. The heavy black walnut door of Isabel\u0027s room, as Fanny\u0027s troubled eyes remained fixed upon it, seemed to become darker and vaguer; the polished wood took the distant ceiling light, at the end of the hall, in dim reflections which became mysterious; and to Fanny\u0027s disturbed mind the single sharp point of light on the bronze door-knob was like a continuous sharp cry in the stillness of night. What interview was sealed away from human eye and ear within the lonely darkness on the other side of that door—in that darkness where Isabel\u0027s own special chairs were, and her own special books, and the two great walnut wardrobes filled with her dresses and wraps? What tragic argument might be there vainly striving to confute the gentle dead? \"In God\u0027s name, what else could I have done?\" For his mother\u0027s immutable silence was surely answering him as Isabel in life would never have answered him, and he was beginning to understand how eloquent the dead can be. They cannot stop their eloquence, no matter how they have loved the living: they cannot choose. And so, no matter in what agony George should cry out, \"What else could I have done?\" and to the end of his life no matter how often he made that wild appeal, Isabel was doomed to answer him with the wistful, faint murmur: \"I\u0027d like to have-seen him. Just—just once.\" A cheerful darkey went by the house, loudly and tunelessly whistling some broken thoughts upon women, fried food and gin; then a group of high school boys, returning homeward after important initiations, were heard skylarking along the sidewalk, rattling sticks on the fences, squawking hoarsely, and even attempting to sing in the shocking new voices of uncompleted adolescence. For no reason, and just as a poultry yard falls into causeless agitation, they stopped in front of the house, and for half an hour produced the effect of a noisy multitude in full riot. To the woman standing upstairs in the hall, this was almost unbearable; and she felt that she would have to go down and call to them to stop; but she was too timid, and after a time went back to her room, and sat at her desk again. She left the door open, and frequently glanced out into the hall, but gradually became once more absorbed in the figures which represented her prospective income from her great plunge in electric lights for automobiles. She did not hear George return to his own room. A superstitious person might have thought it unfortunate that her partner in this speculative industry (as in Wilbur\u0027s disastrous rolling-mills) was that charming but too haphazardous man of the world, George Amberson. He was one of those optimists who believe that if you put money into a great many enterprises one of them is sure to turn out a fortune, and therefore, in order to find the lucky one, it is only necessary to go into a large enough number of them. Altogether gallant in spirit, and beautifully game under catastrophe, he had gone into a great many, and the unanimity of their \"bad luck,\" as he called it, gave him one claim to be a distinguished person, if he had no other. In business he was ill fated with a consistency which made him, in that alone, a remarkable man; and he declared, with some earnestness, that there was no accounting for it except by the fact that there had been so much good luck in his family before he was born that something had to balance it. \"You ought to have thought of my record and stayed out,\" he told Fanny, one day the next spring, when the affairs of the headlight company had begun to look discouraging. \"I feel the old familiar sinking that\u0027s attended all my previous efforts to prove myself a business genius. I think it must be something like the feeling an aeronaut has when his balloon bursts, and, looking down, he sees below him the old home farm where he used to live—I mean the feeling he\u0027d have just before he flattened out in that same old clay barnyard. Things do look bleak, and I\u0027m only glad you didn\u0027t go into this confounded thing to the extent I did.\" Miss Fanny grew pink. \"But it must go right!\" she protested. \"We saw with our own eyes how perfectly it worked in the shop. The light was so bright no one could face it, and so there can\u0027t be any reason for it not to work. It simply—\" \"Oh, you\u0027re right about that,\" Amberson said. \"It certainly was a perfect thing—in the shop! The only thing we didn\u0027t know was how fast an automobile had to go to keep the light going. It appears that this was a matter of some importance.\" \"Well, how fast does one have to—\" \"To keep the light from going entirely out,\" he informed her with elaborate deliberation, \"it is computed by those enthusiasts who have bought our product—and subsequently returned it to us and got their money back—they compute that a motor car must maintain a speed of twenty-five miles an hour, or else there won\u0027t be any light at all. To make the illumination bright enough to be noticed by an approaching automobile, they state the speed must be more than thirty miles an hour. At thirty-five, objects in the path of the light begin to become visible; at forty they are revealed distinctly; and at fifty and above we have a real headlight. Unfortunately many people don\u0027t care to drive that fast at all times after dusk, especially in the traffic, or where policemen are likely to become objectionable.\" \"But think of that test on the road when we—\" \"That test was lovely,\" he admitted. \"The inventor made us happy with his oratory, and you and Frank Bronson and I went whirling through the night at a speed that thrilled us. It was an intoxicating sensation: we were intoxicated by the lights, the lights and the music. We must never forget that drive, with the cool wind kissing our cheeks and the road lit up for miles ahead. We must never forget it and we never shall. It cost—\" \"But something\u0027s got to be done.\" \"It has, indeed! My something would seem to be leaving my watch at my uncle\u0027s. Luckily, you—\" The pink of Fanny\u0027s cheeks became deeper. \"But isn\u0027t that man going to do anything to remedy it? can\u0027t he try to—\" \"He can try,\" said Amberson. \"He is trying, in fact. I\u0027ve sat in the shop watching him try for several beautiful afternoons, while outside the windows all Nature was fragrant with spring and smoke. He hums ragtime to himself as he tries, and I think his mind is wandering to something else less tedious—to some new invention in which he\u0027d take more interest.\" \"But you mustn\u0027t let him,\" she cried. \"You must make him keep on trying!\" \"Oh, yes. He understands that\u0027s what I sit there for. I\u0027ll keep sitting!\" However, in spite of the time he spent sitting in the shop, worrying the inventor of the fractious light, Amberson found opportunity to worry himself about another matter of business. This was the settlement of Isabel\u0027s estate. \"It\u0027s curious about the deed to her house,\" he said to his nephew. \"You\u0027re absolutely sure it wasn\u0027t among her papers?\" \"Mother didn\u0027t have any papers,\" George told him. \"None at all. All she ever had to do with business was to deposit the cheques grandfather gave her and then write her own cheques against them.\" \"The deed to the house was never recorded,\" Amberson said thoughtfully. \"I\u0027ve been over to the courthouse to see. I asked father if he never gave her one, and he didn\u0027t seem able to understand me at first. Then he finally said he thought he must have given her a deed long ago; but he wasn\u0027t sure. I rather think he never did. I think it would be just as well to get him to execute one now in your favour. I\u0027ll speak to him about it.\" George sighed. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d bother him about it: the house is mine, and you and I understand that it is. That\u0027s enough for me, and there isn\u0027t likely to be much trouble between you and me when we come to settling poor grandfather\u0027s estate. I\u0027ve just been with him, and I think it would only confuse him for you to speak to him about it again. I notice he seems distressed if anybody tries to get his attention—he\u0027s a long way off, somewhere, and he likes to stay that way. I think—I think mother wouldn\u0027t want us to bother him about it; I\u0027m sure she\u0027d tell us to let him alone. He looks so white and queer.\" Amberson shook his head. \"Not much whiter and queerer than you do, young fellow! You\u0027d better begin to get some air and exercise and quit hanging about in the house all day. I won\u0027t bother him any more than I can help; but I\u0027ll have the deed made out ready for his signature.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t bother him at all. I don\u0027t see—\" \"You might see,\" said his uncle uneasily. \"The estate is just about as involved and mixed-up as an estate can well get, to the best of my knowledge; and I haven\u0027t helped it any by what he let me have for this infernal headlight scheme which has finally gone trolloping forever to where the woodbine twineth. Leaves me flat, and poor old Frank Bronson just half flat, and Fanny—well, thank heaven! I kept her from going in so deep that it would leave her flat. It\u0027s rough on her as it is, I suspect. You ought to have that deed.\" \"No. Don\u0027t bother him.\" \"I\u0027ll bother him as little as possible. I\u0027ll wait till some day when he seems to brighten up a little.\" But Amberson waited too long. The Major had already taken eleven months since his daughter\u0027s death to think important things out. He had got as far with them as he could, and there was nothing to detain him longer in the world. One evening his grandson sat with him—the Major seemed to like best to have young George with him, so far as they were able to guess his preferences—and the old gentleman made a queer gesture: he slapped his knee as if he had made a sudden discovery, or else remembered that he had forgotten something. George looked at him with an air of inquiry, but said nothing. He had grown to be almost as silent as his grandfather. However, the Major spoke without being questioned. \"It must be in the sun,\" he said. \"There wasn\u0027t anything here but the sun in the first place, and the earth came out of the sun, and we came out of the earth. So, whatever we are, we must have been in the sun. We go back to the earth we came out of, so the earth will go back to the sun that it came out of. And time means nothing—nothing at all— so in a little while we\u0027ll all be back in the sun together. I wish—\" He moved his hand uncertainly as if reaching for something, and George jumped up. \"Did you want anything, grandfather?\" \"What?\" \"Would you like a glass of water?\" \"No—no. No; I don\u0027t want anything.\" The reaching hand dropped back upon the arm of his chair, and he relapsed into silence; but a few minutes later he finished the sentence he had begun: \"I wish—somebody could tell me!\" The next day he had a slight cold, but he seemed annoyed when his son suggested calling the doctor, and Amberson let him have his own way so far, in fact, that after he had got up and dressed, the following morning, he was all alone when he went away to find out what he hadn\u0027t been able to think out—all those things he had wished \"somebody\" would tell him. Old Sam, shuffling in with the breakfast tray, found the Major in his accustomed easy-chair by the fireplace—and yet even the old darkey could see instantly that the Major was not there.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677/49451.html","bookId":1175,"book":{"id":1175,"title":"The Magnificent Ambersons 安伯森情史","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM"}}
