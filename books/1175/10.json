{"id":16145,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"The Honourable George Amberson was a congressman who led cotillions— the sort of congressman an Amberson would be. He did it negligently, tonight, yet with infallible dexterity, now and then glancing humorously at the spectators, people of his own age. They were seated in a tropical grove at one end of the room whither they had retired at the beginning of the cotillion, which they surrendered entirely to the twenties and the late \u0027teens. And here, grouped with that stately pair, Sydney and Amelia Amberson, sat Isabel with Fanny, while Eugene Morgan appeared to bestow an amiable devotion impartially upon the three sisters-in-law. Fanny watched his face eagerly, laughing at everything he said; Amelia smiled blandly, but rather because of graciousness than because of interest; while Isabel, looking out at the dancers, rhythmically moved a great fan of blue ostrich feathers, listened to Eugene thoughtfully, yet all the while kept her shining eyes on Georgie. Georgie had carried out his rehearsed projects with precision, he had given Miss Morgan a nod studied into perfection during his lengthy toilet before dinner. \"Oh, yes, I do seem to remember that curious little outsider!\" this nod seemed to say. Thereafter, all cognizance of her evaporated: the curious little outsider was permitted no further existence worth the struggle. Nevertheless, she flashed in the corner of his eye too often. He was aware of her dancing demurely, and of her viciously flirtatious habit of never looking up at her partner, but keeping her eyes concealed beneath downcast lashes; and he had over-sufficient consciousness of her between the dances, though it was not possible to see her at these times, even if he had cared to look frankly in her direction—she was invisible in a thicket of young dresscoats. The black thicket moved as she moved and her location was hatefully apparent, even if he had not heard her voice laughing from the thicket. It was annoying how her voice, though never loud, pursued him. No matter how vociferous were other voices, all about, he seemed unable to prevent himself from constantly recognizing hers. It had a quaver in it, not pathetic—rather humorous than pathetic—a quality which annoyed him to the point of rage, because it was so difficult to get away from. She seemed to be having a \"wonderful time!\" An unbearable soreness accumulated in his chest: his dislike of the girl and her conduct increased until he thought of leaving this sickening Assembly and going home to bed. That would show her! But just then he heard her laughing, and decided that it wouldn\u0027t show her. So he remained. When the young couples seated themselves in chairs against the walls, round three sides of the room, for the cotillion, George joined a brazen-faced group clustering about the doorway—youths with no partners, yet eligible to be \"called out\" and favoured. He marked that his uncle placed the infernal Kinney and Miss Morgan, as the leading couple, in the first chairs at the head of the line upon the leader\u0027s right; and this disloyalty on the part of Uncle George was inexcusable, for in the family circle the nephew had often expressed his opinion of Fred Kinney. In his bitterness, George uttered a significant monosyllable. The music flourished; whereupon Mr. Kinney, Miss Morgan, and six of their neighbours rose and waltzed knowingly. Mr. Amberson\u0027s whistle blew;\u0027 then the eight young people went to the favour-table and were given toys and trinkets wherewith to delight the new partners it was now their privilege to select. Around the walls, the seated non-participants in this ceremony looked rather conscious; some chattered, endeavouring not to appear expectant; some tried not to look wistful; and others were frankly solemn. It was a trying moment; and whoever secured a favour, this very first shot, might consider the portents happy for a successful evening. Holding their twinkling gewgaws in their hands, those about to bestow honour came toward the seated lines, where expressions became feverish. Two of the approaching girls seemed to wander, not finding a predetermined object in sight; and these two were Janie Sharon, and her cousin, Lucy. At this, George Amberson Minafer, conceiving that he had little to anticipate from either, turned a proud back upon the room and affected to converse with his friend, Mr. Charlie Johnson. The next moment a quick little figure intervened between the two. It was Lucy, gaily offering a silver sleighbell decked with white ribbon. \"I almost couldn\u0027t find you!\" she cried. George stared, took her hand, led her forth in silence, danced with her. She seemed content not to talk; but as the whistle blew, signalling that this episode was concluded, and he conducted her to her seat, she lifted the little bell toward him. \"You haven\u0027t taken your favour. You\u0027re supposed to pin it on your coat,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t you want it?\" \"If you insist!\" said George stiffly. And he bowed her into her chair; then turned and walked away, dropping the sleighbell haughtily into his trousers\u0027 pocket. The figure proceeded to its conclusion, and George was given other sleighbells, which he easily consented to wear upon his lapel; but, as the next figure \u0027began, he strolled with a bored air to the tropical grove, where sat his elders, and seated himself beside his Uncle Sydney. His mother leaned across Miss Fanny, raising her voice over the music to speak to him. \"Georgie, nobody will be able to see you here. You\u0027ll not be favoured. You ought to be where you can dance.\" \"Don\u0027t care to,\" he returned. \"Bore!\" \"But you ought—\" She stopped and laughed, waving her fan to direct his attention behind him. \"Look! Over your shoulder!\" He turned, and discovered Miss Lucy Morgan in the act of offering him a purple toy balloon. \"I found you!\" she laughed. George was startled. \"Well—\" he said. \"Would you rather \u0027sit it out?\u0027\" Lucy asked quickly, as he did not move. \"I don\u0027t care to dance if you—\" \"No,\" he said, rising. \"It would be better to dance.\" His tone was solemn, and solemnly he departed with her from the grove. Solemnly he danced with her. Four times, with not the slightest encouragement, she brought him a favour: \u0027four times in succession. When the fourth came, \"Look here!\" said George huskily. \"You going to keep this up all\u0027 night? What do you mean by it?\" For an instant she seemed confused. \"That\u0027s what cotillions are for, aren\u0027t they?\" she murmured. \"What do you mean: what they\u0027re for?\" \"So that a girl can dance with a person she wants to?\" George\u0027s huskiness increased. \"Well, do you mean you—you want to dance with me all the time—all evening?\" \"Well, this much of it—evidently!\" she laughed. \"Is it because you thought I tried to keep you from getting hurt this afternoon when we upset?\" She shook her head. \"Was it because you want to even things up for making me angry—I mean, for hurting my feelings on the way home?\" With her eyes averted—for girls of nineteen can be as shy as boys, sometimes—she said, \"Well—you only got angry because I couldn\u0027t dance the cotillion with you. I—I didn\u0027t feel terribly hurt with you for getting angry about that!\" \"Was there any other reason? Did my telling you I liked you have anything to do with it?\" She looked up gently, and, as George met her eyes, something exquisitely touching, yet queerly delightful, gave him a catch in the throat. She looked instantly away, and, turning, ran out from the palm grove, where they stood, to the dancing-floor. \"Come on!\" she cried. \"Let\u0027s dance!\" He followed her. \"See here—I—I—\" he stammered. \"You mean—Do you—\" \"No, no!\" she laughed. \"Let\u0027s dance!\" He put his arm about her almost tremulously, and they began to waltz. It was a happy dance for both of them. Christmas day is the children\u0027s, but the holidays are youth\u0027s dancing-time. The holidays belong to the early twenties and the \u0027teens, home from school and college. These years possess the holidays for a little while, then possess them only in smiling, wistful memories of holly and twinkling lights and dance-music, and charming faces all aglow. It is the liveliest time in life, the happiest of the irresponsible times in life. Mothers echo its happiness—nothing is like a mother who has a son home from college, except another mother with a son home from college. Bloom does actually come upon these mothers; it is a visible thing; and they run like girls, walk like athletes, laugh like sycophants. Yet they give up their sons to the daughters of other mothers, and find it proud rapture enough to be allowed to sit and watch. Thus Isabel watched George and Lucy dancing, as together they danced away the holidays of that year into the past. \"They seem to get along better than they did at first, those two children,\" Fanny Minafer said sitting beside her at the Sharons\u0027 dance, a week after the Assembly. \"They seemed to be always having little quarrels of some sort, at first. At least George did: he seemed to be continually pecking at that lovely, dainty, little Lucy, and being cross with her over nothing.\" \"Pecking?\" Isabel laughed. \"What a word to use about Georgie! I think I never knew a more angelically amiable disposition in my life!\" Miss Fanny echoed her sister-in-law\u0027s laugh, but it was a rueful echo, and not sweet. \"He\u0027s amiable to you!\" she said. \"That\u0027s all the side of him you ever happen to see. And why wouldn\u0027t he be amiable to anybody that simply fell down and worshipped him every minute of her life? Most of us would!\" \"Isn\u0027t he worth worshipping? Just look at him! Isn\u0027t he charming with Lucy! See how hard he ran to get it when she dropped her handkerchief back there.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m not going to argue with you about George!\" said Miss Fanny. \"I\u0027m fond enough of him, for that matter. He can be charming, and he\u0027s certainly stunning looking, if only—\" \"Let the \u0027if only\u0027 go, dear,\" Isabel suggested good-naturedly. \"Let\u0027s talk about that dinner you thought I should—\" \"I?\" Miss Fanny interrupted quickly. \"Didn\u0027t you want to give it yourself?\" \"Indeed, I did, my dear!\" said Isabel heartily. \"I only meant that unless you had proposed it, perhaps I wouldn\u0027t—\" But here Eugene came for her to dance, and she left the sentence uncompleted. Holiday dances can be happy for youth renewed as well as for youth in bud—and yet it was not with the air of a rival that Miss Fanny watched her brother\u0027s wife dancing with the widower. Miss Fanny\u0027s eyes narrowed a little, but only as if her mind engaged in a hopeful calculation. She looked pleased. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677/49430.html","bookId":1175,"book":{"id":1175,"title":"The Magnificent Ambersons 安伯森情史","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM"}}
