{"id":16150,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"\"Almost\" was Lucy\u0027s last word on the last night of George\u0027s vacation— that vital evening which she had half consented to agree upon for \"settling things\" between them. \"Almost engaged,\" she meant. And George, discontented with the \"almost,\" but contented that she seemed glad to wear a sapphire locket with a tiny photograph of George Amberson Minafer inside it, found himself wonderful in a new world at the final instant of their parting. For, after declining to let him kiss her \"good-bye,\" as if his desire for such a ceremony were the most preposterous absurdity in the world, she had leaned suddenly close to him and left upon his cheek the veriest feather from a fairy\u0027s wing. She wrote him a month later: No. It must keep on being almost. Isn\u0027t almost pretty pleasant? You know well enough that I care for you. I did from the first minute I saw you, and I\u0027m pretty sure you knew it—I\u0027m afraid you did. I\u0027m afraid you always knew it. I\u0027m not conventional and cautious about being engaged, as you say I am, dear. (I always read over the \"dears\" in your letters a time or two, as you say you do in mine—only I read all of your letters a time or two!) But it\u0027s such a solemn thing it scares me. It means a good deal to a lot of people besides you and me, and that scares me, too. You write that I take your feeling for me \"too lightly\" and that I \"take the whole affair too lightly.\" Isn\u0027t that odd! Because to myself I seem to take it as something so much more solemn than you do. I shouldn\u0027t be a bit surprised to find myself an old lady, some day, still thinking of you—while you\u0027d be away and away with somebody else perhaps, and me forgotten ages ago! \"Lucy Morgan,\" you\u0027d say, when you saw my obituary. \"Lucy Morgan? Let me see: I seem to remember the name. Didn\u0027t I know some Lucy Morgan or other, once upon a time?\" Then you\u0027d shake your big white head and stroke your long white beard —you\u0027d have such a distinguished long white beard! and you\u0027d say, \u0027No. I don\u0027t seem to remember any Lucy Morgan; I wonder what made me think I did?\u0027 And poor me! I\u0027d be deep in the ground, wondering if you\u0027d heard about it and what you were saying! Good-bye for to-day. Don\u0027t work too hard—dear! George immediately seized pen and paper, plaintively but vigorously requesting Lucy not to imagine him with a beard, distinguished or otherwise, even in the extremities of age. Then, after inscribing his protest in the matter of this visioned beard, he concluded his missive in a tone mollified to tenderness, and proceeded to read a letter from his mother which had reached him simultaneously with Lucy\u0027s. Isabel wrote from Asheville, where she had just arrived with her husband. I think your father looks better already, darling, though we\u0027ve been here only a few hours It may be we\u0027ve found just the place to build him up. The doctors said they hoped it would prove to be, and if it is, it would be worth the long struggle we had with him to get him to give up and come. Poor dear man, he was so blue, not about his health but about giving up the worries down at his office and forgetting them for a time—if he only will forget them! It took the pressure of the family and all his best friends, to get him to come—but father and brother George and Fanny and Eugene Morgan all kept at him so constantly that he just had to give in. I\u0027m afraid that in my anxiety to get him to do what the doctors wanted him to, I wasn\u0027t able to back up brother George as I should in his difficulty with Sydney and Amelia. I\u0027m so sorry! George is more upset than I\u0027ve ever seen him— they\u0027ve got what they wanted, and they\u0027re sailing before long, I hear, to live in Florence. Father said he couldn\u0027t stand the constant persuading—I\u0027m afraid the word he used was \"nagging.\" I can\u0027t understand people behaving like that. George says they may be Ambersons, but they\u0027re vulgar! I\u0027m afraid I almost agree with him. At least, I think they were inconsiderate. But I don\u0027t see why I\u0027m unburdening myself of all this to you, poor darling! We\u0027ll have forgotten all about it long before you come home for the holidays, and it should mean little or nothing to you, anyway. Forget that I\u0027ve been so foolish! Your father is waiting for me to take a walk with him—that\u0027s a splendid sign, because he hasn\u0027t felt he could walk much, at home, lately. I mustn\u0027t keep him waiting. Be careful to wear your mackintosh and rubbers in rainy weather, and, as soon as it begins to get colder, your ulster. Wish you could see your father now. Looks so much better! We plan to stay six weeks if the place agrees with him. It does really seem to already! He\u0027s just called in the door to say he\u0027s waiting. Don\u0027t smoke too much, darling boy. Devotedly, your mother Isabel. But she did not keep her husband there for the six weeks she anticipated. She did not keep him anywhere that long. Three weeks after writing this letter, she telegraphed suddenly to George that they were leaving for home at once; and four days later, when he and a friend came whistling into his study, from lunch at the club, he found another telegram upon his desk. He read it twice before he comprehended its import. Papa left us at ten this morning, dearest. Mother. The friend saw the change in his face. \"Not bad news?\" George lifted utterly dumfounded eyes from the yellow paper. \"My father,\" he said weakly. \"She says—she says he\u0027s dead. I\u0027ve got to go home.\" His Uncle George and the Major met him at the station when he arrived —the first time the Major had ever come to meet his grandson. The old gentleman sat in his closed carriage (which still needed paint) at the entrance to the station, but he got out and advanced to grasp George\u0027s hand tremulously, when the latter appeared. \"Poor fellow!\" he said, and patted him repeatedly upon the shoulder. \"Poor fellow! Poor Georgie!\" George had not yet come to a full realization of his loss: so far, his condition was merely dazed; and as the Major continued to pat him, murmuring \"Poor fellow!\" over and over, George was seized by an almost irresistible impulse to tell his grandfather that he was not a poodle. But he said \"Thanks,\" in a low voice, and got into the carriage, his two relatives following with deferential sympathy. He noticed that the Major\u0027s tremulousness did not disappear, as they drove up the street, and that he seemed much feebler than during the summer. Principally, however, George was concerned with his own emotion, or rather, with his lack of emotion; and the anxious sympathy of his grandfather and his uncle made him feel hypocritical. He was not grief-stricken; but he felt that he ought to be, and, with a secret shame, concealed his callousness beneath an affectation of solemnity. But when he was taken into the room where lay what was left of Wilbur Minafer, George had no longer to pretend; his grief was sufficient. It needed only the sight of that forever inert semblance of the quiet man who had been always so quiet a part of his son\u0027s life—so quiet a part that George had seldom been consciously aware that his father was indeed a. part of his life. As the figure lay there, its very quietness was what was most lifelike; and suddenly it struck George hard. And in that unexpected, racking grief of his son, Wilbur Minafer became more vividly George\u0027s father than he had ever been in life. When George left the room, his arm was about his black-robed mother, his shoulders were still shaken with sobs. He leaned upon his mother; she gently comforted him; and presently he recovered his composure and became self-conscious enough to wonder if he had not been making an unmanly display of himself. \"I\u0027m all right again, mother,\" he said awkwardly. \"Don\u0027t worry about me: you\u0027d better go lie down, or something; you look pretty pale.\" Isabel did look pretty pale, but not ghastly pale, as Fanny did. Fanny\u0027s grief was overwhelming; she stayed in her room, and George did not see her until the next day, a few minutes before the funeral, when her haggard face appalled him. But by this time he was quite himself again, and during the short service in the cemetery his thoughts even wandered so far as to permit him a feeling of regret not directly connected with his father. Beyond the open flower-walled grave was a mound where new grass grew; and here lay his great-uncle, old John Minafer, who had died the previous autumn; and beyond this were the graves of George\u0027s grandfather and grandmother Minafer, and of his grandfather Minafer\u0027s second wife, and her three sons, George\u0027s half-uncles, who had been drowned together in a canoe accident when George was a child—Fanny was the last of the family. Next beyond was the Amberson family lot, where lay the Major\u0027s wife and their sons Henry and Milton, uncles whom George dimly remembered; and beside them lay Isabel\u0027s older sister, his Aunt Estelle, who had died, in her girlhood, long before George was born. The Minafer monument was a granite block, with the name chiseled upon its one polished side, and the Amberson monument was a white marble shaft taller than any other in that neighbourhood. But farther on there was a newer section of the cemetery, an addition which had been thrown open to occupancy only a few years before, after dexterous modern treatment by a landscape specialist. There were some large new mausoleums here, and shafts taller than the Ambersons\u0027, as well as a number of monuments of some sculptural pretentiousness; and altogether the new section appeared to be a more fashionable and important quarter than that older one which contained the Amberson and Minafer lots. This was what caused George\u0027s regret, during the moment or two when his mind strayed from his father and the reading of the service. On the train, going back to college, ten days later, this regret (though it was as much an annoyance as a regret) recurred to his mind, and a feeling developed within him that the new quarter of the cemetery was in bad taste—not architecturally or sculpturally perhaps, but in presumption: it seemed to flaunt a kind of parvenu ignorance, as if it were actually pleased to be unaware that all the aristocratic and really important families were buried in the old section. The annoyance gave way before a recollection of the sweet mournfulness of his mother\u0027s face, as she had said good-bye to him at the station, and of how lovely she looked in her mourning. He thought of Lucy, whom he had seen only twice, and he could not help feeling that in these quiet interviews he had appeared to her as tinged with heroism— she had shown, rather than said, how brave she thought him in his sorrow. But what came most vividly to George\u0027s mind, during these retrospections, was the despairing face of his Aunt Fanny. Again and again he thought of it; he could not avoid its haunting. And for days, after he got back to college, the stricken likeness of Fanny would appear before him unexpectedly, and without a cause that he could trace in his immediately previous thoughts. Her grief had been so silent, yet it had so amazed him. George felt more and more compassion for this ancient antagonist of his, and he wrote to his mother about her: I\u0027m afraid poor Aunt Fanny might think now father\u0027s gone we won\u0027t want her to live with us any longer and because I always teased her so much she might think I\u0027d be for turning her out. I don\u0027t know where on earth she\u0027d go or what she could live on if we did do something like this, and of course we never would do such a thing, but I\u0027m pretty sure she had something of the kind on her mind. She didn\u0027t say anything, but the way she looked is what makes me think so. Honestly, to me she looked just scared sick. You tell her there isn\u0027t any danger in the world of my treating her like that. Tell her everything is to go on just as it always has. Tell her to cheer up!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677/49435.html","bookId":1175,"book":{"id":1175,"title":"The Magnificent Ambersons 安伯森情史","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1677","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:33 AM"}}
