{"id":90880,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\"Jenny?\" Dee\u0027s voice said hesitantly. \"Jenny, are you okay?\" I\u0027ve had such a strange dream, Jenny thought, but when she lifted her face from her hands, it was real. She was sitting on the floor of her grandfather\u0027s basement, in a puddle of icy-cold water. Dee, Audrey, Zach, and Michael were standing in another puddle, looking at her. \"I found these three in the hallway,\" Zach said. \"We fell down a shaft,\" Michael said. \"This hole just opened up in front of us. It took us all the way back to the first floor.\" \"It was a chute,\" said Dee. \"I fell down it, too, and then we had to walk back up here.\" \"We followed your crayon trail, and it ended at a door,\" Zach finished. \"We pressed the button and ...\" \"It let us in,\" Audrey said crisply, when he stopped. \"But it looks like something\u0027s already happened.\" \"My nightmare,\" Jenny said. She was having a very hard time bringing herself back to the present. The five-year-old in her mind seemed more real than the sixteen-year-old these people were talking to. Dee and Michael and Audrey looked like strangers. Not Zach, because Zach had been there when she was five. Zach, maybe, understood this. In any case he knelt on the floor beside her, ignoring the water soaking into his jeans. \"What happened?\" he said, his gray eyes steady. \"I lost,\" Jenny said dully, feeling strangely removed from everything. \"I screwed up. I couldn\u0027t save him. I lost.\" \"It\u0027s something about Grandpa Evenson, isn\u0027t it?\" \"What do you know about it?\" Zach hesitated, then, looking her directly in the face, he said, \"Only what my parents told me. They say he-went crazy that day. Tried to-well, hurt you.\" Jenny was shocked out of her apathy. \"What?\" \"They found you here, in the basement, with your clothes all torn and your arms all scratched. Your legs and feet were bleeding....\" \"From the ice,\" Jenny whispered. \"I got dragged through the ice. And he scratched my hands to make me let him go. They were taking him. He let them take him instead of me.\" Then, suddenly, she was sobbing again. She felt a movement, then a slender, hard arm around her. Dee. A rustle and a cool hand on her wrist. Audrey, heedless of her fancy clothes. An awkward, warm grip from behind on her shoulder. Michael, They were all around her, all trying to help. \"You went through our nightmares with all of us,\" Audrey said softly. \"It\u0027s not fair you had to face yours alone.\" Jenny shook her head. \"You don\u0027t understand. All of you had nightmares about things you were scared might happen. Mine did happen-because of me. It was real. It was my fault.\" \"Tell us,\" Dee said, her face stern and beautiful. \"He was a sorcerer,\" Jenny said. She looked at Zach. \"You mean, all this time everybody thought he tried to hurt me?\" \"What were they supposed to think?\" Zach said. \"You were here, practically in a coma. You screamed if anyone tried to touch you, but you wouldn\u0027t talk. And he was gone. They figured he ran away when he realized what he tried to do. And when they looked around at this place\"-Zach looked around the basement himself and snorted-\"well, they knew he was crazy. Paranoid. Because all this junk turned out to be-\" \"Charms for protection,\" Jenny said. \"Right. I mean, what kind of nut collects thousands of those from all over the world? And he had piles of books on the occult, all kinds of garbage____\" \"He was a sorcerer,\" Jenny said again. \"Not a black one. Maybe not a white one, either, but not black. He wasn\u0027t trying to do evil. He was just-a little bit naive. He didn\u0027t allow for accidents happening ... like a five-year-old coming down here on a day he didn\u0027t expect her, and opening a door she knew she shouldn\u0027t touch.\" \"That door?\" Dee looked at the empty closet. Jenny nodded. \"But what was in the closet? A monster?\" \"Julian.\" They all stared at her. Jenny swallowed the bad taste in her mouth. \"My grandfather wanted-well, the same thing those German boys in the forest wanted, I guess.\" She looked at Audrey. \"Power. Or maybe he was just curious. He knew there were-things - out in the darkness, and he caught some. Maybe he used runes to summon them up, I don\u0027t know. But I know he used a rune to hold them. On that door.\" \"And just what,\" Michael said, his voice unusually grim, \"would you call the things he caught?\" \"Aliens,\" Jenny said, looking at Dee. \"Dark elves,\" she said, looking at Audrey. \"Demons,\" she said, turning around to face Michael. \"The Shadow Men,\" she said to Zach. Dee hissed softly in comprehension. Once started, Jenny couldn\u0027t seem to stop. \"Dakaki. The Erlking. The old gods. The fairy folk...\" \"Okay,\" Michael said huskily. \"Enough, already.\" \"They\u0027re real,\" Jenny said. \"They\u0027ve always been here-like genies, you know? The old name for a genie was djinn, and in his notes my grandfather called them aljunnu. Djinn-aljunnu-Julian-get it? It was a joke. They like to play with us....\" Her voice was rising. She felt herself gripped from all sides, but she went on. \"He was keeping them trapped-but I let them out, and that changed everything. They said they had the right to take me. But he went instead. He did it for me.\" She stopped. \"If we\u0027re going to get through this,\" Dee said, \"we\u0027ve got to be strong. We\u0027ve got to stand together. All right?\" \"Right,\" Audrey said, the first to confirm it. Looking down, Jenny saw Audrey\u0027s perfectly polished nails entwined with Dee\u0027s slender dark fingers. Both holding on to each other, to Jenny. \"Right,\" Zach said with no hesitation, no distance in his winter-gray eyes. His long-fingered artist\u0027s hand came down over Dee\u0027s and Audrey\u0027s. \"Right,\" whispered Michael, and he gripped Zach\u0027s hand with his own square pudgy fingers, unembarrassed. \"But there\u0027s nothing to do,\" Jenny said, almost crying again. \"He won. I lost. I didn\u0027t make it through my nightmare. That door\"-nodding at the closet one-\"was always here. It\u0027s not the way out.\" \"What about that one?\" Michael said, standing back and looking up the stairs. Jenny had to move around the bookcase to see it. Instead of the blank wall she had seen earlier at the top of the staircase, there was a door. Directly above them-in the room above-a clock struck five. \"You must have done something right,\" Dee said. Jenny\u0027s skirt was clammy, clinging to her legs. Her hair, she knew, was in complete disarray. She was exhausted and still shaking inside, and it seemed like years since she had slept. \"I\u0027ll go first,\" she said and led them up the stairs, trying to look like Dee, proud as a princess. She found her slip of paper on the top step and stepped on it. \"If that\u0027s the turret-the top of the house-we\u0027ve won,\" Audrey said. \"Right?\" Somehow Jenny didn\u0027t think it was going to be that easy. She twisted the knob and pushed, and the door swung back on oiled hinges. They all stepped into the room above. It was much larger than any turret could possibly be. It was the More Games store. Well, more or less, Jenny thought. There were the same shelves and racks and tables with the same uncanny games on them. There was the same small window-quite dark-and the same lamps with shades of purple and red and blue glass. But there were differences, too. One was the grandfather clock standing near a corner, ticking loudly and steadily. The other was Tom. Jenny ran to him. He was huddled against the clock, chained to it somehow. Her mind registered fury at the humiliation of that, then went on to more important things. \"Tommy,\" she said, reaching with both hands for him. He turned weakly, and Jenny was shocked. There were no bruises on his face, but he looked-ravaged. His skin was unhealthily pale, and there were black circles under his eyes. He gave her the ghost of his own rakish smile. \"Hey, Thorny,\" he said painfully. Jenny put her face against his shoulder and cried. The faded-photograph memory had disappeared. What Jenny remembered now was the day of their first kiss, in second grade, behind the hibiscus bushes at George Washington Elementary School. They\u0027d both gotten detention, but it had been worth it. That kiss, she thought. Everything innocent. Everything sweet. Tom hadn\u0027t been arrogant, then, hadn\u0027t taken anything for granted. Tom had loved her. \"Tommy,\" she said. \"I missed you so much. What did he do to you?\" Tom shook his head. \"Hardly anything ... I don\u0027t understand. There were the rats\"-his haunted eyes skittered around the floor-\"but they\u0027re gone now.\" Rats. So that was what Tom had seen in the parlor-the invisible things that had tried to climb up his legs. In second grade Tom had owned a turtle, and his older brother Greg had owned a pet rat. One morning they woke up to find that the rat had eaten the turtle-eaten it right out of the shell. I knew how upset that made him-how much he hated rats after that, Jenny thought. Why didn\u0027t I realize what they were in the parlor? Because it hadn\u0027t seemed bad enough. Tom had been so afraid. But one thing Jenny had learned: Everybody\u0027s nightmare was scariest to them. You had to see it with them, get into their shoes, to understand just how scary. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she whispered. \"But, oh, Tom, your wrists-\" They were torn, bleeding. He was wearing shackles like the kind his brother Bruce used in police work. The rest of him was wrapped up like Marley\u0027s ghost. \"I kept trying to get away,\" he said. \"Not because of the rats. Because I saw you. He would come and hold up a mirror, and I could see you and what was happening to you. I saw you go through everything. When Summer died ...\" He stopped to get control of himself, his face twisting. Saw we? Jenny thought in horror. Pictures of what Tom might have seen when she and Julian were together flashed through her mind. Then she felt a backwash of relief. If Julian had been standing here holding a mirror, he must have been showing Tom the times when he-Julian-wasn\u0027t with Jenny. Still, she had to know. \"Did you ever see-him-in the mirror?\" \"No. But he told me-he told me he was doing things to you. To all of you. He laughed about it.\" Jenny gripped both his hands. \"Don\u0027t you worry about him, Tom. He can\u0027t hurt us anymore. We\u0027re free, Tom-we\u0027ve won. Now we just need to find the way out of here.\" Tom looked at her, then nodded behind her. Jenny turned. She\u0027d missed it before, because Tom had so quickly captured her attention. There was a door, just like the door in the More Games store that led out onto Montevideo Street. But this door was partly open, showing darkness outside. Standing before it, completely blocking the way, were a giant coiled snake and a large wolf. \"The Creeper and the Lurker. At last,\" Dee said. \"Just a slight problem,\" Michael said nervously. They weren\u0027t real animals exactly-they looked more as if they\u0027d been painted with luminous paint on the darkness. Like some special effect Zach might make for a photo. But the wolf breathed and the snake\u0027s fluorescent tongue flicked in and out. Jenny felt sure that they could move-and do harm. She fingered Tom\u0027s chains. \"He has to let us go. The rules were that if we got to the top of the house, we could go free.\" \"Not exactly,\" the liquid, elemental voice said from the back of the store. He was dressed the way he had been in the More Games store, in that weird combination of cyberpunk and Byronic poet. The snake tattoo was back on his wrist. He looked as laconic as he had in the store, and as beautiful. His hair was like moonstone, white with a shimmery blue glow inside. In this dim light his eyes were midnight blue. He looked-charming, sinister, and slightly mad. A demon prince with the face of an angel. Jenny was suddenly very frightened. And much more alert. Seeing Julian cleared the cobwebs out of your brain instantly. She straightened her back, still kneeling. The others were gathering themselves, too. What light there was caught Zach\u0027s light hair and the gold clasp of Audrey\u0027s Brunetti calfskin belt. Jenny could see by their faces that they knew Julian better now-not because they\u0027d seen him in the Game but because they understood what he was. Julian smiled his strange, sweet smile. \"You all wanted to know who I am. Well, I\u0027ll give you a final riddle,\" he said. \"I\u0027m a Visitor from the stars. I\u0027m the Erlking. I\u0027m Loki. I\u0027m Puck. I\u0027m the Hunter. I\u0027m the Shadow Man. I\u0027m your nightmares come true.\" \"We figured that out,\" Jenny said, quietly, steadily. \"And we played your game and won. Now we want to go home.\" \"You didn\u0027t let me finish,\" Julian said, turning the smile on her. \"Do you remember, when you first came in the game store, I showed you the ancient Tibetan game of goats and tigers?\" He gestured, one of his easy, flowing motions, and Jenny saw the bronze board on a table. Tiny figures, also bronze, sat on it somewhat like chess pieces. \"Well, that\u0027s what you\u0027ve really been playing,\" Julian said, and at the sound of his voice Jenny felt the walls closing in. He smiled at her particularly. \"You are all the innocent little goats ... and I\u0027m the tiger.\" Tom\u0027s hands were gripping Jenny\u0027s numbingly. Dee was in the forward stance, left leg forward, right leg back, ready for action. Zach looked bleak, and Audrey and Michael had moved closer together. \"You didn\u0027t really think,\" Julian said to Jenny, \"that I would let you go.\" Jenny felt dizzy. Smothering. \"You said ... you were playing the Game fairly,\" she got out, with barely the breath to say it. \"You promised me-\" \"I\u0027m not hidebound by tradition. And I am playing fairly-I said if you got to the turret before dawn, you\u0027d find the door home standing open. It is open-it\u0027s just that I won\u0027t let you get to it.\" Jenny looked at the animals guarding the door. What could even Dee do to fight them? \"By the way, Tommy, here, hasn\u0027t even faced his real nightmare yet. But there\u0027ll be plenty of time. We\u0027ve got something like eternity ahead of us, you know,\" Julian said. His eyes were like liquid cobalt -and ravenous. Hungrier than the wolf\u0027s as he looked at Jenny and Tom together there. God help me, Jenny thought. Please, someone help. She looked at Tom, but Tom was looking at Julian, with such hatred and fury that it made Jenny afraid for him. \"Then this whole \u0027Game\u0027 has been a farce,\" Tom said, almost spitting the words. His hazel eyes were burning. Julian spread his hands and inclined his head slightly-almost a bow. As if someone had complimented him on a job well done. But it was Jenny he spoke to. \"I told you I\u0027d do whatever was necessary to get you. At first I was sure you\u0027d lose the Game-most people do. Then, when I saw you had a chance of winning, I figured I could make you turn to me for help. But you wouldn\u0027t. She\u0027s very strong, you know,\" he added, flicking a heavy-lidded glance at Tom. \"Much too good for you.\" \"I know,\" Tom said, and Jenny looked at him, astonished. \"But she\u0027s a thousand times too good for you.\" \"I want her for goodness\u0027 sake,\" Julian said and smiled. \"Light to my darkness. You\u0027ll see-Tommy. You\u0027ll have years and years and years to see how well she and I fit together.\" He turned back to Jenny. \"In any case, you\u0027ve gotten this far, and I\u0027m afraid I have to tell you the truth. Which is that the whole Game has been just-a game. The kind a cat plays with a mouse.\" \"Before eating it?\" Dee said in a voice like a knife. Julian barely glanced back at her. \"I\u0027m only hungry for one thing at the moment, Deirdre. But my friends by the door have strange appetites. I wouldn\u0027t go near them if I were you. And of course there are all the other Shadow Men-all my elders, those ancient, bone-sucking, lip-licking wraiths-they\u0027d all like to get hold of you. This house keeps them outside-but you wouldn\u0027t get far if you opened a window.\" Jenny felt the trembling in Tom\u0027s clenched fists and bowed her head. She was thinking of the poem in her grandfather\u0027s room. Like the other fools/Who\u0027ve slipped on these same stones and played and lost. . Did everyone lose to the Shadow Men? The dice are loaded, she thought. You can\u0027t win. All bets are off. \"They\u0027d love to sink a tooth in you,\" Julian was saying to Dee. \"Do you know you\u0027re the image of Ankhesenamun, one of the greatest beauties of Egypt?\" Even as he spoke, Dee snapped her right leg up in a high kick, pulling her toes back at the last minute to deliver a devastating blow with the heel. At least, that was how it should have happened. Julian, with the reflexes of a rattlesnake, caught her foot as it came at him and jerked up, flinging Dee on her back. \"Rule One in this Game,\" Julian said, smiling. \"Don\u0027t mess with me. I\u0027ll beat you every time.\" Dee got up, obviously in pain-there was no way to break a fall like that-and Julian turned back to Jenny. Jenny met his ravenous eyes and felt something inside her change forever. \"Let the others go,\" she said clearly and softly, \"and I\u0027ll stay with you.\" Julian stared at her. Everyone stared at her. Then somebody-she thought it was Michael-started to laugh. Julian smiled, very slightly, just one corner of his lip up. Not an amused smile. His eyes had gone the blue of gas flames. \"I see,\" he said. Jenny detached her hands from Tom\u0027s. She stood up. \"I\u0027m serious. Let them go ... and I\u0027ll stay ... of my own free will. And you know what that means.\" She was thinking of the darkroom, of the boy masquerading as her cousin who\u0027d held her in his arms. The boy she\u0027d kissed-of her own free will. She was hoping Julian remembered, too. She thought he did. He looked intrigued. A strange, sensuous smile curved his lips. \"Willingly?\" he repeated, as if testing the word. \"Willingly.\" \"No ...\" Tom whispered. \"Willingly,\" Jenny repeated, looking only at Julian. Julian looked charmed-but wary. \"You\u0027d have to make a promise-seal the bond. In a way that couldn\u0027t be broken.\" \"Yes.\" She could see she\u0027d startled him. He\u0027d expected her to play for time, to argue. Didn\u0027t he understand that she\u0027d changed? She raised her eyebrows at him, ironically. \"The sooner the better,\" she said. Julian blinked, then said slowly, \"Beautiful Deirdre can leave, and Audrey. So can Zach and Michael. But Tommy stays. I\u0027ll keep him as a hostage for your good behavior.\" Looking up at him, Jenny felt her lip twitch, not quite a smile. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll need that. ...\" \"All the same.\" \"All right. It doesn\u0027t matter to me.\" Then, stepping close to him, she spoke quietly, for his ears alone. \"Julian, don\u0027t you know that I\u0027ve changed? Can\u0027t you see that? I still care about Tom, but... it\u0027s not the same. He\u0027d seem tame after you. Anything would seem tame after you.\" His eyes widened slightly in fascination. Jenny took a deep breath. \"I probably would have come to you a lot earlier if you\u0027d just straight out asked me. Didn\u0027t that ever occur to you? That you could just appear at my front door, no games, no threats, and just ask me?\" He looked disconcerted. \"Not exactly. ...\" \"You\u0027re too cynical. Do you know, I think the way you look at things has made you blind. You\u0027ve gotten so hardened that you think you have to fight the universe to get what you want. To-sort of wrestle it out of people.\" \"And-don\u0027t I?\" \"Not always,\" Jenny said. Meeting his gaze directly, she said, \"Sometimes there\u0027s a much simpler solution. There are some things you can\u0027t force, Julian, and you can\u0027t buy them, either. They have to be given, for free. That\u0027s what I want to give you.\" His fascination was complete. \"Then promise yourself to me,\" he said, and with a motion like a sleight-of-hand trick, he held something between his fingers. A gold circlet. Jenny reached for it automatically, taking it between forefinger and thumb. It was a simple ring, with a design she couldn\u0027t quite make out on the outside. Inside the band something was written in fancy script. She tilted the ring toward one of the small lamps. All I refuse \u0026 Thee I chuse, she read. \"Put this on your finger and you\u0027re sworn mine,\" Julian said. \"No way to break the promise, no way to change the bond. It\u0027s a short ceremony. Do you want to go through with it?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-hunter-the-forbidden-game-1/page-14.html","bookId":2100,"book":{"id":2100,"title":"The Forbidden Game: The Hunter (The Forbidden Game #1)","description":"Storyline: The first part of the book Jenny is looking to buy a game (at a game store) because she is having a group of friends coming over to her house to hang out.
