{"id":90877,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"What\u0027s taking them so long?\" Dee said.\n Audrey and Michael had gone off to see if they could find Zach, who they figured must be around here somewhere. Or if they could find water-or a blanket-or something-for Jenny.\n Jenny was in bad shape. She was slumped against the slanting mirrored wall opposite Summer\u0027s door -what had been Summer\u0027s door. There wasn\u0027t a trace of the exit from Summer\u0027s nightmare left, but Jenny wouldn\u0027t leave this place.\n Jenny ached. All she could think of, in between waves of grayness, was Summer. Summer had joined their group in fourth grade, after she, Tom, Dee, Zach, and Michael were already friends. Tiny, muddled, and very sweet, Summer had needed to be taken care of, and taking care was what Jenny did best.\n But not this time. This time Jenny had screwed up. And Summer was gone.\n Jenny still didn\u0027t believe it had really happened. Summer would come walking out of that mirror any second now, all thistledown hair and dark blue eyes. Any second now.\n Summer didn\u0027t.\n Jenny let her head drop back against the wall.\n \"I\u0027m going to look for them,\" Dee said. \"They\u0027ve been too long, they might be in trouble. You stay here, okay? Promise you\u0027ll stay right here.\" Her voice was slow and clear, the voice you\u0027d use to talk to a child.\n Eyes shut, Jenny made some slight motion with her head.\n \"Okay. I\u0027ll be back in a minute.\"\n Jenny\u0027s mind drifted back into a haze. Summer climbing a tree at camp, Summer at Newport Beach falling off a surfboard, Summer at school chewing on a pencil. Summer laughing, Summer puzzled, Summer\u0027s blue eyes filled with tears.\n She didn\u0027t have a mean bone in her body, Jenny thought. She was a good person. Something like this can\u0027t happen to a good person.\n Can it?\n She saw the flash even through closed lids.\n Summer! she thought, opening her eyes. But the mirror in front of her showed only her own pale, anxious face and disarrayed hair.\n Maybe it had come from the side. Which way? On her feet, Jenny looked to the right and left, dazzled by the multiple reflections. She didn\u0027t even know which way Dee had gone.\n She went right, veering back and forth around the zigzag mirrors.\n Turning a corner, she saw dozens of reflections of a round blue light bulb.\n She caught her breath sharply. The blue light was on, the red button beneath it was depressed. Beside it was a dark rectangle-an open door.\n Numb to caution, Jenny poked her head in. She could see only darkness inside. None of the light from the hallway seemed to penetrate.\n Had Audrey and Michael gone in here? Had Dee? Could Summer -\n With a click the button popped out, the door began to close. Jenny had an instant to choose: jump back or jump forward. She jumped forward.\n The door slid noiselessly shut behind her, and she stared around, trying to see in the gloom. She could make out shapes like a row of shelves, something on a tripod, a tall lamp. Then she knew where she was. It was dim simply because the lights were off.\n As her eyes adjusted she recognized a giant mural print on one wall. It showed cafeteria tables stacked in a glorious pyramid, one trash can on each end at each level-a marvel of engineering. Jenny knew that picture well. She, Tom, and Dee had spent an entire night stacking those tables and listening to Zach\u0027s imperious demands for \"one more shot.\" It had been one of the more hysterical and terrifying adventures of their sophomore year.\n This was her cousin Zach\u0027s garage, converted into a studio. It felt almost like home-but there was no one in sight.\n The darkroom, Jenny thought, and followed the special L-shaped hallway Zach had built-a light trap, he called it-to the little room nestled within\n the garage. She pushed aside the curtain at the entrance.\n The amber safe light shone on a single figure\u0027s back, on a flannel shirt and a casual ponytail.\n \"Zach!\" Jenny ran to him, but he didn\u0027t turn around. \"Zach, it\u0027s me, Jenny. Zach-what are you\n doing?\"\n He was gently rocking a tray full of chemicals with a print in it. His body was stiff and resistant, but Jenny turned him by force. Even in this light she could see he looked-tranced. The look she\u0027d seen first in the living room when he\u0027d insisted on turning more game cards, and then in the parlor when all the rest of them were freaking out.\n \"Oh, Zach, what\u0027s wrong with you?\" she said and threw her arms around him. She\u0027d been worried about him all night; she\u0027d been planning to comfort him, to help. But now she didn\u0027t have the strength. She desperately needed help herself.\n He scarcely seemed to notice she was there. He pushed her away and turned back to agitating the tray.\n \"Zachary, did Dee come in here? Have you seen Audrey or Michael?\"\n His voice was slow, dragging, but matter-of-fact.\n \"I haven\u0027t seen anybody. I was sitting out there. Where the mirrors are. Then I saw a flashgun go off. When I looked for it, I found a door. I pushed the button and went in.\"\n A flashgun-of course, that was how Zach would interpret the bursts of light in the hallway. \"But what are you doing?\" Jenny said.\n \"It was all set up for me. The print was already in the developer.\" Somewhere a timer went off, and he pulled away from Jenny\u0027s reaching hand. \"I have to rinse it now.\"\n Jenny blinked painfully as he turned the white light on. She watched his careful, clever fingers as he rinsed the print and plastered it wetly against the wall, standing back to evaluate it, frowning.\n \"Zach, please. You have to listen.\" The numbness over Summer was wearing off. Zach was her blood relative, and right here, and in trouble. In this light she could see how pale his narrow face was. She could also see the fixed look in his clear gray eyes. \"Don\u0027t you realize this is your nightmare? We can\u0027t waste time-we have to find a door to get out. Zach!\"\n He pushed her away again. \"I have to finish this job. I have to ...\"\n She was barely in time to catch him as he collapsed. But when she did he didn\u0027t push her away again. He clung to her like a frightened child.\n \"Jenny ... sorry...\"\n \"It\u0027s okay.\" She held him tightly, almost rocking him. \"It\u0027s okay, I\u0027m here. That\u0027s what cousins are for.\"\n After a minute he tried to straighten up, but she still held him, encouraging him to hold her back. She needed comfort as much as he did, and Zach had always been there for her. Before their families had moved out to California, she and Zach had lived next door to each other. They\u0027d played Indians in the cherry orchard behind their houses. That was in the days before Zach decided he liked photographs better than people, when Zach\u0027s gray eyes had been warm instead of winter-cool.\n Her cousin\u0027s mind was obviously following the same track. \"Just like when we were kids,\" he said with what was probably supposed to be a laugh.\n \"And you\u0027d get all scraped up climbing trees, and we\u0027d wash you with the hose so Aunt Lil wouldn\u0027t get mad,\" Jenny said. She laughed, herself, muffled against Zach\u0027s shoulder. It was almost like crying. \"Oh, Zach, I\u0027m so glad I found you.\"\n \"Me, too.\" He sighed. \"I\u0027ve been feeling pretty weird.\"\n \"Everything\u0027s been awful,\" Jenny said, and once again her voice was shaking badly. \"I\u0027ve been so scared-and now ...\"\n She couldn\u0027t bring herself to mention Summer. The words stuck in her throat.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" he said. \"We\u0027re together now. We\u0027ll make things okay.\"\n A hose and a Band-Aid aren\u0027t going to help this time, Jenny thought, but it was easier just to hold on to Zach. Tighter and tighter. Exchanging comfort without words. He was stroking her hair and it felt good-soothing. She seemed to feel strength flowing from his body to hers.\n And something else. A warmth that surprised her. Zach was usually so cool. Now he was holding her and caressing her almost as if she were some toddler that needed pacifying.\n Or-as if he weren\u0027t her cousin, but her boyfriend.\n She pushed the thought away. Zach was just being kind. He wanted to help-and he was helping. She felt better, simply absorbing his sympathy, his affection. His-tenderness.\n She leaned against him, letting him support her weight. Feeling secure. Cared for. Safe.\n When he kissed the back of her neck, it was so tenderly it didn\u0027t disturb the safe feeling. Zach was nice. She loved him; she was happy to know he loved her.\n When he kissed her again, an unexpected tremor ran through her.\n Now-she wasn\u0027t supposed to feel like that. Not with Zach. He shouldn\u0027t-he really shouldn\u0027t....\n But she didn\u0027t want to pull away from him or spoil the moment.\n His lips were warm on the back of her neck. A shock of sweetness passed through Jenny, this time too strong to be ignored. That felt-she knew she mustn\u0027t feel that way. Her hands went up to his arms, to push at him.\n \"Zach,\" she whispered. \"I think we\u0027re both-a little upset. We\u0027re not ourselves.\"\n \"I know,\" Zach said, as if it hurt him. \"I\u0027m sorry-I ...\" He straightened, loosening his grip a little, but then he kissed her hair. She felt his lips moving, felt his warm breath there.\n \"Zachary,\" she said. \"It\u0027s wrong. We\u0027re cousins.\" The problem was that although her words were strong, her voice wasn\u0027t. She could barely breathe. And she didn\u0027t move away.\n \"Half cousins,\" he said. It was true, although Jenny seldom thought of it-her mother and his were only half sisters. \"And besides, I can\u0027t help it. 1 can\u0027t help it.\" His kisses were coming faster.\n His urgency caught Jenny in a rush of elemental feeling. She kept thinking, but there\u0027s something else-without remembering what the something was. Then she whispered, \"But, Tom...\"-and shock swept over her.\n She hadn\u0027t thought about Tom since-since -\n She couldn\u0027t remember when.\n Zach was saying that he couldn\u0027t help Tom, either.\n \"He doesn\u0027t deserve you.\" The words came on a warm wave of breath in her ear. \"He doesn\u0027t love you enough. I was always afraid to say it, but you know it\u0027s true.\"\n Despite his slimness Zach\u0027s muscles were hard against her. Jenny tried to protest, but the words caught in her throat.\n \"And now I know you don\u0027t love him enough, either. You weren\u0027t meant to be with him.\" Zach\u0027s voice was soft and reasonable, his words running together in a velvet sound.\n Then he was looking down at her. A clear light seemed to shine through his intense face. His winter-gray eyes looked almost pale blue.\n \"You can\u0027t fight something like this, Jenny,\" he whispered. \"You know you can\u0027t.\"\n Jenny shut her eyes and turned her face up.\n He kissed her and her senses reeled.\n They seemed to melt together. Jenny felt herself sinking beneath his embrace. So soft... kissing had never been so soft before. She couldn\u0027t think anymore. She was flying. She was deep underwater.\n Pure sensation overwhelmed her. She was kissing him back as she had never kissed Tom. His hair was loose under her fingers; it must have come out of the ponytail. She wanted to feel all of it. It was so much softer than she\u0027d realized. She\u0027d always thought of Zach as having rather coarse hair, but this was so soft... like silk or cat\u0027s fur under her fingertips....\n She heard the wild, whimpering sound she made, and she knew, she knew, even as she was pulling back. Even as she was jerking away, she knew.\n Julian\u0027s eyes were like liquid sapphires under sooty lashes. Heavy-lidded and dark with passion. He was wearing a plaid flannel shirt like Zach\u0027s shirt, stone-washed denims like Zach\u0027s denims, and running shoes like Zach\u0027s shoes. But he had a languid, careless grace Zach would never have. His hair looked bright as sand in moonlight.\n Jenny was scrubbing her mouth with the back of her hand. A purely reflexive and senseless gesture. She was too shocked to be angry.\n Did I know? Did I know underneath before he kissed me or while he was kissing me but before I pulled away did I know could I possibly have known ... ?\n She still couldn\u0027t make out what reality was.\n \"How could you know... ?\" she whispered. \"You acted like Zach-you knew things only he would know-\"\n \"I\u0027ve watched him,\" Julian said. \"I\u0027ve watched you. I\u0027m the Shadow Man, Jenny-and I love you.\" His voice was soft, mesmerizing, and something inside Jenny began to melt at the very sound.\n Then she thought of Summer.\n Anger, hot and bright, surged through her and gave her strength. She looked into Julian\u0027s liquid-blue eyes. Any softness she\u0027d ever had toward him had disappeared. She hated him now. Without a word she turned and walked out of the darkroom.\n He followed her, flicking the garage lights on. He knew, of course, what she was thinking about.\n \"She agreed,\" he said. \"Just like all the rest of you, she agreed to play the Game.\"\n \"She didn\u0027t know it was real!\"\n He quoted from the instructions. \" \u0027I acknowledge that the Game is real.\n \"You can talk all you want, Julian-but you killed her.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t do anything to her. Her own fear did that. She couldn\u0027t face her nightmare.\"\n Jenny knew there was no point in arguing with him, but she couldn\u0027t help it. In a low, savage voice she said, \"It wasn\u0027t fair.\"\n He shook his head, looking almost amused. \"Life isn\u0027t fair, Jenny. Haven\u0027t you learned that yet?\"\n Jenny was raging on. \"What gives you the right to play with us this way? How can you justify it?\"\n \"I don\u0027t need the right. Listen to me, Jenny. The worlds-all nine of them-are cruel. They don\u0027t care anything about you, or about right. There is no ultimate goodness. It\u0027s the law of the jungle. You don\u0027t need right-if you have strength.\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe you,\" Jenny said.\n \"That the world is cruel?\" There was a newspaper on the bench; he picked it up. \"Take a look at this and tell me that evil loses and good wins. Tell me that it\u0027s not the law of the jungle in your world.\"\n Jenny didn\u0027t even want to look at the headlines. She\u0027d seen too many in her life.\n \"Reality,\" Julian said, flashing a smile, \"has teeth and claws. And since that\u0027s true, wouldn\u0027t you rather be one of the hunters than one of the hunted?\"\n Jenny shook her head. She had to admit the truth of what he was saying-about the world, at least. But she felt sick to her stomach.\n \"I\u0027m offering you a choice,\" Julian said. His face had hardened. \"I told you before that if I couldn\u0027t\n persuade you I would force you-somehow. If you won\u0027t agree I\u0027ll have to show you what I mean. I\u0027m tired of playing, Jenny. I want this settled-one way or another.\"\n \"It is settled,\" Jenny said. \"I\u0027ll never come to you. I hate you.\"\n Anger flared like a twisting blue flame in Julian\u0027s eyes. \"Don\u0027t you understand,\" he said, \"that what happened to Summer can happen to you?\"\n Jenny felt a wave of coldness. \"Yes,\" she said slowly. \"I do.\"\n And she did, at last. She probably wouldn\u0027t have believed it before. Wouldn\u0027t have believed Julian was capable of it, or that she, Jenny, could be vulnerable to it. Dying was for old people, not kids her age. Bad things-really bad things-didn\u0027t happen to good people.\n But they did.\n Now she knew that emotionally. In her heart. Sometimes bad things, the worst, happened to people who didn\u0027t deserve it at all. Even Summer. Even her.\n Jenny felt as if she had learned some secret, been initiated into some worldwide club or community. The community of sorrow.\n She was now one of the people who knew. Strangely, it gave her a sense of comfort to know that there were so many others, so many who\u0027d had friends die, or lost parents, or had other terrible things happen that they never asked for.\n There are a lot of us, she thought. Without realizing it, she\u0027d begun to cry. We\u0027re everywhere. And we don\u0027t all turn hunter and take it out on other people. All of us don\u0027t.\n Aba hadn\u0027t. Jenny suddenly remembered that Dee\u0027s grandmother had lost her husband in a racial incident. And she remembered something Aba had taped to her bathroom mirror, incongruous among all the glass and marble and gold fixtures. It was a handmade sign that said:\n Do no harm. Help when you can. Return good for evil.\n Jenny had never asked Aba about the sign. It didn\u0027t seem to need explaining.\n Now she felt the community of sorrow strengthening her from all over. As if they were sympathizing, silently. Bad things-the worst-might happen to Jenny, right now. Jenny understood that.\n She said, \"You\u0027re right. Maybe things are that bad. But that doesn\u0027t mean I have to give in. I won\u0027t join you willingly, so you might as well try force.\"\n \"I will,\" he said.\n It started so simply. Jenny heard a whining buzz and a bee landed on her sleeve.\n It was just an ordinary bee, dusty-gold. It clung with its little feet to her tissue-linen blouse. But then she heard another buzz, and a second bee landed on her other sleeve.\n Another buzz, and another.\n Jenny hated bees. She was always the one at picnics shrieking, \"Is there one in my hair?\" She wanted to shoo these bees away, but she was afraid to provoke them.\n She looked at Julian. At his wild, exotic sapphire eyes and his beautifully sculpted face. At that moment, wearing Zach\u0027s lackluster clothing, his beauty was so unearthly it was frightening.\n Another buzz and a bee was in her hair, its wings a blur of motion as it tangled and clung. She could see it in her peripheral vision.\n Julian smiled.\n Jenny heard a deeper sound, a thrumming, and she looked automatically for the source. A swarm of bees was clustered on one of the rafters of the garage, hanging down like some giant, pendulous fruit.\n Jenny took a step backward and heard a warning buzzzzz from her hair. The ball of bees was moving, breaking up. Becoming a dark cloud.\n Heading toward her.\n Jenny looked once more at Julian, and then bees began to fall on her like hail. They clung to her arms, her shoulders, her breasts. She had to hold her arms away from her body in order to keep from crushing the ones on her sides. She knew that if she did that they would sting.\n Then it simply became a nightmare, unreal.\n They were heavy, covering her like a blanket. Too heavy. Jenny staggered. She shut her eyes because they were crawling out of her hair onto her face. She was inundated with bees, layer upon layer of them. They were clinging to each other now, because there was almost no part of her body clear of them. Her fingertips, some parts of her face. She felt their feet on her cheeks and wanted to scream, but she couldn\u0027t, she couldn\u0027t scream because if she did-if she did-They\u0027d get into her mouth. And then she\u0027d lose her sanity. But she couldn\u0027t breathe well enough through her nose. Her chest was heaving and their weight was crushing her. She was going to have to open her mouth.\n She was crying silently, trying not to move, to disturb them more than she could help. Julian\u0027s voice came to her.\n \"Just say the word, Jenny.\"\n She could only shake her head slightly. The barest minimum of motion. But what she could manage, she did. She was still sobbing without a sound, terrified to move, but she would not-she would not-give in.\n You can do whatever you like to me, she thought. In the dark beneath her bee-covered eyes she tried to hold on to consciousness, but it was like a thin thread slipping through her fingers. She grasped at it, felt it being snatched away from her.\n She was fainting. Falling. But she wouldn\u0027t give in.\n When I hit the ground and crush them, they\u0027ll go mad. They\u0027ll kill me, she thought.\n But she never said the word to stop it.\n She felt the darkness come as she began to fall. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-hunter-the-forbidden-game-1/page-11.html","bookId":2100,"book":{"id":2100,"title":"The Forbidden Game: The Hunter (The Forbidden Game #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The first part of the book Jenny is looking to buy a game (at a game store) because she is having a group of friends coming over to her house to hang out.
