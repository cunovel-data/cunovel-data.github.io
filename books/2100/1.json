{"id":90867,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Jenny glanced back over her shoulder. They were still behind her, on the other side of the street but definitely following. They matched their pace to hers; when she slowed to pretend to look in a store window, they slowed, too.\\n\\n There were two of them, one dressed in a black T-shirt and leather vest, with a black bandanna on his head, the other in a long flannel shirt, black-and-blue plaid, unbuttoned. Also unwashed. They both looked like trouble.\\n\\n The game store was a few blocks ahead. Jenny quickened her pace a little. This wasn\u0027t the best neighborhood in town, and she\u0027d come here specifically because she didn\u0027t want any of her friends to see her. She hadn\u0027t realized, though, that Eastman Avenue had gotten quite so rough. After the last riots the police had cleared things up, but many of the vandalized stores still had boarded windows, which gave Jenny a creeping feeling between her shoulder blades. They were like bandaged eyes turned toward her.\\n\\n Not at all the place to be at dusk-but it wasn\u0027t dusk yet, Jenny told herself fiercely. If only those two guys would turn off onto another street. Her heart was beating unpleasantly hard. Maybe they had turned....\\n\\n She slowed again, her feet in their lace-up canvas Tretons making no sound on the dirty sidewalk. From behind and to the left she heard the flat smack of running shoes and the clack of bootheels. The footsteps slowed.\\n\\n They were still there.\\n\\n Don\u0027t look back, she told herself. Think. You have to cross over at Joshua Street to get to the store-but that means crossing left, to their side of the street. Bad idea, Jenny. While you\u0027re crossing they can catch up to you.\\n\\n All right, then, she\u0027d turn off before that, she\u0027d go right on this next street up here-what was it? Montevideo. She\u0027d go right on Montevideo, and then she\u0027d find a store to duck into, a place to hide until the two guys had passed by.\\n\\n The Tower Records on the corner of Eastman and Montevideo was no longer in business. Too bad. Back straight, stubbornly pretending she was perfectly calm, Jenny walked by the darkened windows. She caught a glimpse of herself in one of them: a slender girl with hair that Michael had once said was the color of honey in sunlight. Her eyebrows were straight, like two decisive brush strokes, and her forest-green eyes were dark as pine needles and even more serious than usual. She looked worried.\\n\\n She turned right at the cross street. As soon as she was out of sight of Eastman Avenue, she stopped and stood as still as a deer, backpack swinging from her hand, eyes desperately scanning Montevideo for cover.\\n\\n Directly opposite her was a vacant lot and beside that a Thai restaurant, closed. Behind her the looming bulk of the record store presented a blank wall to the street all the way down to the park. No cover. Nowhere to hide.\\n\\n Jenny\u0027s neck prickled and her little fingers began to tingle.\\n\\n She turned toward Eastman and hugged the wall, tossing back her hair to listen.\\n\\n Were those footsteps or just the sick thudding of her own heart?\\n\\n She wished that Tom were with her.\\n\\n But of course that was the whole point. Tom couldn\u0027t be with her, since it was his party she was shopping for.\\n\\n It was supposed to have been a pool party. Jenny Thornton was known for her pool parties, and here in southern California late April was a perfectly reasonable time to have one. The temperature often hovered in the mid-seventies at night, and the Thornton pool glowed like a huge blue-green jewel in the backyard, giving off little wisps of steam from its surface. The perfect setting for an outdoor barbecue.\\n\\n Then three days ago the cold snap had come ... and Jenny\u0027s plans were ruined. Nobody except polar bears swam in this kind of weather.\\n\\n She\u0027d meant to rethink things, to come up with some other brilliant idea, but it had been one of those weeks. Summer\u0027s fourteen-year-old schnauzer had finally had to be put to sleep, and Summer had needed Jenny for moral support. Dee had taken a kung fu exam, and Jenny had gone to cheer her on. Audrey and Michael had had a fight, and Zach had had the flu....\\n\\n And then suddenly it had been Friday afternoon, with just hours to go before the party and everyone expecting something special-and nothing set up.\\n\\n Fortunately an idea had come to her in the middle of computer applications class. A game. People gave murder mystery parties and Pictionary parties and things like that. Why not a game tonight? It would have to be a very special game, of course. Something chic enough for Audrey, sexy enough for Tom, and even scary, if possible, to keep Dee\u0027s interest. Something seven people could play at once.\\n\\n Vague notions had run through Jenny\u0027s head of the only really exciting games she\u0027d ever played as a child. Not the ones the adults arranged, but the kind you devised on your own once they were safely out of the house. Truth or dare and spin the bottle. Some combination of those two-only more sophisticated, of course, more suited to juniors in high school-would be ideal.\\n\\n That was what had brought her to Eastman Avenue. She\u0027d known perfectly well it wasn\u0027t the best neighborhood, but she\u0027d figured that at least none of her friends would see her and find out about this last-minute scramble for entertainment. Jenny had gotten herself into this mess; she would get herself out of it.\\n\\n Only now the mess was getting bigger than she\u0027d bargained for.\\n\\n She could definitely hear footsteps now. They sounded very close and were approaching quickly.\\n\\n Jenny looked down Montevideo again, her mind taking in irrelevant details with obsessive precision. The record store wall was not truly blank after all. There was a mural on it, a mural of a street that looked much like Eastman Avenue before the riots. Strange-parts of the mural looked real. Like that storefront painted in the middle, the one with the sign Jenny couldn\u0027t quite make out. It had a door that looked real: The handle seemed three dimensional. In fact...\\n\\n Startled, Jenny took a step toward it. The knob appeared to change shape as she moved, like any three-dimensional object. She looked more closely and found she could see the difference in texture between the wooden door and the painted concrete wall.\\n\\n The door was real.\\n\\n It couldn\u0027t be-but it was. There was a door stuck in the middle of the mural.\\n\\n Why, Jenny didn\u0027t know. There wasn\u0027t time to wonder about it. Jenny needed to get off the street, and if this door was unlocked ...\\n\\n Impulsively she took hold of the knob.\\n\\n It was cool as china and it turned in her hand. The door swung inward. Jenny could see a dimly lit room.\\n\\n One instant of hesitation, then she stepped inside.\\n\\n Just as she did, she consciously took in the sign above the door. It read: \"More Games.\"\\n\\n I here was a push-button lock on the inside doorknob, and Jenny depressed it. There were no windows looking out on Montevideo, of course, so she couldn\u0027t see whether the two guys had followed her. Still, she had a tremendous feeling of relief. No one was going to find her in here.\\n\\n Then she thought, More Games? She had often seen signs reading \"More Books\" in the arty, shabby used bookstores around here, signs with an arrow pointing up a narrow staircase to another floor. But how could there be More Games when there hadn\u0027t been any games at all yet?\\n\\n Just the fact that it happened to be a game store she\u0027d stumbled onto was strange, but very convenient. She could do her shopping while she waited for the tough guys to go away. The owner would probably be glad to have her; with that mural camouflaging the door they couldn\u0027t do much business here.\\n\\n As she looked around she saw just how strange the store really was. Even stranger than the usual odd shops around Eastman Avenue.\\n\\n The room was lit by one small window and several old-fashioned lamps with stained-glass shades. There were shelves and tables and racks like any other store, but the objects on them were so exotic that Jenny felt as if she\u0027d stepped into another world. Were they all games? They couldn\u0027t be. Jenny\u0027s mind filled suddenly with wild images from The Arabian Nights, images of foreign bazaars where anything-anything-might be sold. She stared around at the shelves in amazement.\\n\\n God, what a weird chessboard. Triangular. Could anybody really play on a board like that? And there was another one, with strange, squat chessmen carved of rock crystal. It looked more than antique -it looked positively ancient.\\n\\n So did a metalwork box covered with arabesques and inscriptions. It was made of brass or maybe bronze, decorated with gold and silver and Arabic writing. Whatever was in that box, Jenny knew she couldn\u0027t afford it.\\n\\n Some of the games she could identify, like the mahogany mah-jongg table with ivory tiles spilled carelessly on the green felt top. Others, like a narrow enameled case crawling with hieroglyphics, and a red box embossed with a gold Star of David in a circle, she had never seen before. There were dice of every size and description: some twelve-sided, some shaped like pyramids, and some ordinary cubical ones made of odd materials. There were card decks fantastically colored like illuminated manuscripts.\\n\\n Strangest of all, the weird antique things were intermixed with weird ultramodern things. A cork bulletin board on the back wall sported signs reading: \"Flame.\" \"Rant.\" \"Rave.\" \"Surf the Edge.\" \"Cheap Thrills.\" Cyberpunk, Jenny thought, vaguely recognizing the terms. Maybe they sold computer games here, too. From a boom box on the counter came 120-beat-a-minute acid house music.\\n\\n This, thought Jenny, is a very peculiar place.\\n\\n It felt so-cut off-from everything outside. As if time didn\u0027t exist here, or ran differently somehow. Even the dusty sunlight slanting in that one window seemed wrong. Jenny would have sworn the light should have been coming from the other direction. A chill went through her.\\n\\n You\u0027re mixed up, she told herself. Disoriented. And no wonder, after the day you\u0027ve had-after the week you\u0027ve had. Just concentrate on finding a game, if there\u0027s anything here that you can actually play.\\n\\n There was another sign on the board, a sort of square:\\n\\n W E L C\\n\\n O M E T\\n\\n O M Y W\\n\\n O R L D\\n\\n Jenny tilted her head, examining it. What did the letters say? Oh, of course, she had it now. Welcome...\\n\\n \"Can I help you?\"\\n\\n The voice spoke from right behind her. Jenny turned-and lost her breath.\\n\\n Eyes. Blue eyes. Except that they weren\u0027t just blue, they were a shade Jenny couldn\u0027t describe. The only place she\u0027d seen a blue like that was once when she\u0027d happened to wake up at the precise instant of dawn. Then, between the window curtains, she\u0027d glimpsed an unbelievable, luminous color, which had lasted only a second before fading to the ordinary blue of the sky.\\n\\n No boy should have eyes as blue as that, and especially not surrounded by lashes so heavy they seemed to weigh his eyelids down. This boy had the most startling coloring she\u0027d ever seen. His eyelashes were black, but his hair was white-true white, the color of frost or tendrils of mist. He was ... well, beautiful. But in the most exotic, uncanny way imaginable, as if he\u0027d just stepped in from another world. Jenny\u0027s reaction was instant, total, and absolutely terrifying. She forgot Tom\u0027s existence.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know people could look like that. Real people, I mean. Maybe he\u0027s not real. God, I\u0027ve got to stop staring -\\n\\n But she couldn\u0027t. She couldn\u0027t help herself. Those eyes were like the blue at the core of a flame. No-like a mile-deep lake set in a glacier. No ...\\n\\n The guy turned and went to the counter. The boom box clicked off. Silence roared in Jenny\u0027s ears.\\n\\n \"Can I help you?\" he repeated, politely and indifferently.\\n\\n Heat rose to Jenny\u0027s cheeks.\\n\\n Ohmigod, what he must think of me.\\n\\n The moment those eyes had turned away from her, she had come out of it, and now that he was farther away, she could look at him objectively. Not something from another world. Just a guy about her own age: lean, elegant, and with an unmistakable air of danger about him. His hair was white-blond, cropped close at the sides, long in back and so long over the forehead that it fell into his eyes. He was dressed all in black in a weird combination of cyberpunk and Byronic poet.\\n\\n And he\u0027s still gorgeous, Jenny thought, but who cares? Honestly, you\u0027d think I\u0027d never seen a guy before. On Tom\u0027s birthday, too -\\n\\n A flash of shame went through her. She\u0027d better start her shopping or get out of here. The two alternatives seemed equally attractive-except that the tough guys might still be outside.\\n\\n \"I want to buy a game,\" she said, too loudly. \"For a party-for my boyfriend.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t even blink at the word boyfriend; in fact, he looked more laconic than ever. \"Be my guest,\" he said. Then he seemed to rouse himself to make a sale. \"Anything in particular?\"\\n\\n \"Well...\"\\n\\n \"How about Senet, the Egyptian Game of the Dead?\" he said, nodding at the enameled case with the hieroglyphics. \"Or the I-ching? Or maybe you\u0027d like to cast the runes.\" He picked up a leather cup and shook it suggestively. There was a sound like rattling bones.\\n\\n \"No, nothing like that.\" Jenny was feeling distinctly unnerved. She couldn\u0027t put her finger on it, but something about this guy sent whispers of alarm through her blood. Maybe it was time to go.\\n\\n \"Well-there\u0027s always the ancient Tibetan game of goats and tigers.\" He gestured at a curiously carved bronze board with tiny figurines on it. \"The fierce tigers, see, stalk the innocent little goats, and the innocent little goats try to run from the tigers. For two players.\"\\n\\n \"I-no.\" Was he making fun of her? There was something to the twist of his mouth that made Jenny think yes. With dignity she said, \"I was looking for-just a game that a lot of people can play at once. Like Pictionary or Outburst,\" she added defiantly. \"But since you don\u0027t seem to have anything like that in the store-\"\\n\\n \"I see,\" he said. \"That kind of game.\" Suddenly, looking at her sideways, he smiled. The smile unnerved Jenny more than anything yet.\\n\\n Definitely time to go, she thought. She didn\u0027t care whether the tough guys were still outside. \"Thank you,\" she said with automatic politeness, and she turned to the door.\\n\\n \"Mystery,\" he said. His voice caught Jenny halfway across the room. She hesitated in spite of herself. What on earth did he mean?\\n\\n \"Danger. Seduction. Fear.\" Jenny turned back to face him, staring. There was something almost mesmerizing about his voice-it was full of elemental music, like water running over rock. \"Secrets revealed. Desires unveiled.\" He smiled at her and pronounced the last word distinctly: \"Temptation.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\" she said, tensed to hit him or run if he took one step toward her.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t. His eyes were as innocently blue as Nordic fjords. \"The Game, of course. That\u0027s what you want, isn\u0027t it? Something ... very special.\"\\n\\n Something very special.\\n\\n Exactly what she\u0027d thought herself.\\n\\n \"I think,\" she said slowly, \"that I\u0027d better-\"\\n\\n \"We do have something like that in stock,\" he said.\\n\\n Now\u0027s your chance, she told herself when he\\n\\n disappeared through a door into the back room. You can just walk out of here. And she was going to leave, she was just about to go, when he appeared again.\\n\\n \"I think,\" he said, \"that this is what you\u0027ve been looking for.\"\\n\\n She looked at what he was holding, then up at his face.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to be joking,\" she said.\\n\\n The box was about the size and shape of a Monopoly game. It was white and glossy and there wasn\u0027t a single word, line, or figure printed on it.\\n\\n A blank white box.\\n\\n Jenny waited for the punch line.\\n\\n There was something about it, though. The more she looked at that box, the more she felt...\\n\\n \"Could I see it?\" she said. Touch it, was what she meant. For some reason she wanted to feel the weight of it in her hands, the sharpness of its corners in her palms. It was silly, but she did want to. She really wanted to.\\n\\n The guy leaned back, tilting the box between his own hands, gazing at its glossy top. Jenny noticed that there wasn\u0027t a single fingerprint on the shiny finish, not so much as a smudge. She also noticed that his fingers were long and slender. And that he had a snake tattooed on his right wrist.\\n\\n \"Well...\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know. On second thought, I\u0027m not sure I can sell it to you after all.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because it really is special. Un-mundane. I can\u0027t let it go to just anybody, or for just any reason. Maybe if you explained what it was for... .\"\\n\\n Why, he\u0027s a tease, Jenny thought. Without in the least stopping being scared, or disturbed, or any of the other things she\u0027d been since she\u0027d come into this store, she started being amused as well. Wildly, inexplicably amused.\\n\\n Maybe if I looked like him, was that gorgeous, I\u0027d be a tease, too, she thought. She said seriously, \"It\u0027s for a party tonight, for my boyfriend, Tom. He\u0027s seventeen today. Tomorrow night we\u0027ll have the big party-you know, with everybody invited, but tonight it\u0027s just our group. Our crowd.\"\\n\\n He tilted his head to one side. Light flashed off the earring he was wearing-a dagger or a snake, Jenny couldn\u0027t tell which. \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So I need something for us to do. You can\u0027t just get seven people in a room, throw Doritos at them, and expect them to have a good time. I\u0027ve screwed up massively by not getting organized until now-no real food, no decorations. And Tom-\"\\n\\n The guy tilted the box again. Jenny watched its surface turn milky, then bright, then milky again. It was almost hypnotic. \"And Tom will care?\" he said, as if not believing it.\\n\\n Jenny felt defensive. \"I don\u0027t know-he might be disappointed. He deserves better, you see,\" she added quickly. \"He\u0027s-\" Oh, how to explain Tom Locke? \"He\u0027s-well, he\u0027s incredibly handsome, and by the end of this year he\u0027ll have lettered in three sports-\"\\n\\n \"I get it.\"\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t,\" Jenny said, horrified. \"He\u0027s not like that at all. Tom is wonderful. He\u0027s just-so wonderful that sometimes it takes a little keeping up with him. And we\u0027ve been together forever, and I love him, and I have since second grade. Okay?\" Anger gave her courage, and she advanced a step toward the guy. \"He is absolutely the best boyfriend in the world, and anybody who says he isn\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-hunter-the-forbidden-game-1/page-1.html","bookId":2100,"book":{"id":2100,"title":"The Forbidden Game: The Hunter (The Forbidden Game #1)","description":"Storyline: The first part of the book Jenny is looking to buy a game (at a game store) because she is having a group of friends coming over to her house to hang out.
