{"id":2100,"title":"The Forbidden Game: The Hunter (The Forbidden Game #1)","description":"Storyline: The first part of the book Jenny is looking to buy a game (at a game store) because she is having a group of friends coming over to her house to hang out. At the game store she chooses the most \"unusual\" game to buy because the \"guy\" at the game store talks her into buying this particular game. Fast forward a little - Julian (the guy at the store) is actually from the dark world. He has been watching Jenny for years, from a far and is totally in love with her. He wants her with him in his world. Jenny\u0027s boyfriend thinks differently. Any hoo...Jenny\u0027s friends start the game not knowing that it is a \"forbidden game\". It turns out that the game is magical... and here are the rules - if Julian wins, he gets Jenny - if Jenny and her friends win, they go free. Simple right? - Wrong - because Julian is in charge of the game.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-forbidden-game-the-hunter-the-forbidden-game-1.jpg","author":"L.J.
