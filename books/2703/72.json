Then she chased me until she caught me in my bedroom. She hit me until I passed out, and...I don’t remember anything else after that.” Zoey shuddered and hugged herself. “I kind of prefer passing out during a beating. I don’t like remembering...or feeling it.” I reached over slowly and unpeeled her fingers off her forearm from where she was hugging herself, then I squeezed her hand gently. “Will you please tell me why you’re so upset? I know what it feels like to think something’s important, only to find out someone else thinks it’s stupid. I promise I won’t think any less of you. I just want to help.” She lowered her face and sniffed. “We had open critique in my writing class today.” I pulled her hand against my chest and squeezed it a little bit harder. She didn’t have to tell me she’d gotten some bad comments about her story. She wouldn’t be sitting here, sobbing, if it’d gone okay. I didn’t say anything, just stroked the knuckles on her hand and waited for her to talk. A minute later, she sniffed again, blew out a shuddery breath, and wiped at her cheek with the back of her free hand. “Not one person liked it. It was stupid, silly, immature. The teacher went into a big long tirade about the differences between true literature and...and...whatever drivel I’d written. Talking animals are bad. Stories with no connection to the human condition are worthless—” “Now wait a second,” I butted in, frowning. “The Silver Belt had all kinds of connections to deeper things. And the frog in that was the funniest character in the entire story.” Zoey jerked her face up, her eyes wide as she blinked them. “Y-you actually read The Silver Belt already? All of it?” “Well...yeah. And it connected with me, like, really well. I kept thinking about it long after I finished. How Truman always felt like he was on the outside of everything, left out as if he was missing the biggest step of how to be a true fisherman. I feel that way practically every day. Not about fishing, but other things. And I’m serious about that frog. You’re not allowed to take him out of that story.” She gave a watery laugh, and I swear, watching her smile made my entire day. “You really liked him?” she asked, her voice uncertain. “I’ve read it three times,” I said. “So I don’t think the problem is your writing. It was just...your audience. I don’t think they wanted to teach you to be a better writer, they wanted to teach you to write a certain way. I just hope you know not everyone wants to read their kind of stories. Some of us prefer the talking animals. And there’s nothing wrong with that.” She nodded and brushed the last of her tears off her face. “Okay. Thank you.” Her eyes lifted to mine. The trust and gratitude I saw made my chest fill with this awesome pressure. “I just wish I would’ve known that before I turned in my first story.” I pulled her closer and gave her a one-armed hug. “So do I.” Because I seriously hated to see her cry. “Thank you again, Quinn. I don’t know what I would’ve done if you hadn’t come along and—” “Hey, no problem.” I bumped my shoulder into her to get her to look at me. Then I grinned, flashing my dimple in pleading. “Just promise you’ll let me read more of your talking animals, and we’ll call it even.” She rolled hers eyes but grinned back. “You don’t seriously want to read more.” “Heck, yes, I do.” I stood up, dusted off my pants and then held down a hand to her. “Until then, what do you say? Want to work on some biology?” Groaning as she stood, she gifted me with a dry glance. “No. But...I probably should. You’re a better teacher than the professor.” I grinned. “Thank you. Now let’s find a table around here and get our geek on.” When I tightened my grip on her hand, she tightened hers right back. I felt good that hour, helping her with her homework and making silly jokes about people against talking animals. She finally loosened up enough to joke back with me. I was never so happy that I’d been able to get past my physical reaction to her so we could finally be friends. Because I really liked being Zoey’s friend. My first trip to the Forbidden Nightclub to watch the band Non-Castrato play their first gig started with me full of nerves.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-72.html","bookId":2703,"book":{"id":2703,"title":"With Every Heartbeat (Forbidden Men #4)","description":"Storyline: I used to think everything was black and white, truth or lie, easy or hard, that if I could just escape my strict, overbearing, abusive father, my life would be perfect. But since I’ve found a reason to risk his wrath and leave, to help a friend in need, I’ve come to realize everything I thought I knew is wrong. Friends have their own agenda, honesty comes with a dosage of lie, easy doesn’t even exist, keeping secrets sucks, and love...love is the most painful thing of all. Maybe if Quinn Hamilton hadn’t asked me to skip classes for the day and help him pick out an engagement ring for my best friend, I wouldn’t have fallen for him so completely on that sunny Tuesday afternoon and I wouldn’t feel so conflicted. But I did, and I can’t take it back, no matter how hard I try. So I have to deal with the fact that even I’m not as good, or honest, or caring as I’d always thought I was, and no matter what I do next, someone’s going to get hurt. Probably me. -Zoey Blakeland","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}}
