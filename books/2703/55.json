But when she glanced at me, something in my face must’ve changed her mind, because her shoulders slumped. “It’s stupid,” she added, looking exposed and alone. “Just...I’m taking a creative writing class.”\\n\\n “Really?” When she hurried to her feet to leave, I stood up as well. “I didn’t know you were a writer.”\\n\\n “Oh, I’m not.” She looked at me quickly, and then just as quickly looked away. “I mean...I just dabble here and there. It’s silly, really.”\\n\\n As she started for the exit, I fell into step beside her. “How is that silly? I think it’s amazing. I have no creativity whatsoever when it comes to storytelling. So I’m in awe of your ability.”\\n\\n “But I’m not...and you...you’re...”\\n\\n I couldn’t help it. I smiled. Usually, I was the one fumbling for words. “I’m a biology nerd?” I guessed as I opened the door for her to precede me outside.\\n\\n She snorted, but quickly covered her mouth and blushed over her response. After delicately clearing her throat, she lowered her hand. “Uh, no. Nerd is the last word I’d use to describe you.”\\n\\n I had been a nerd in high school, though, so it was nice to learn my image was somewhat improving. “The jock thing kind of screwed it up, huh?”\\n\\n With a laugh, she kept pace with me across the campus. “Maybe that’s it. You’re a unique hybrid mix.”\\n\\n Hybrid. Hybrid was so much better than freak. I liked the word hybrid. Almost as much as I liked her laugh.\\n\\n “Is biology your major?” She moved closer to me to allow a bigger group to pass by, and her scent wafted up to my nostrils. My body instantly tensed. I’d managed not to get close enough to smell her throughout our entire study session, and now...now I just wanted to bury my face in the crook of her neck and inhale as deeply as my lungs would let me.\\n\\n I shook my head and let out a breath when the group passed because she moved back out of my space.\\n\\n “Uh...” Crap, what had we been talking about? She looked up at me, her green eyes so big and innocent and questioning.\\n\\n Major! Somehow, my brain ignited the memory.\\n\\n “Pre-med,” I blurted, then rolled my shoulders to relax myself. “I’m a pre-med major.”\\n\\n “No way. Really?” She seemed pleasantly surprised. “You’re going to be a doctor?”\\n\\n I nodded. “I’d like to be a heart surgeon.”\\n\\n Her eyebrows crinkled. “Okay, that sounds really specific. What made you go with heart surgeon?”\\n\\n “My grandma.” It was those eyes, I swear. So curious, and interested, and green. I started spilling everything. “She, uh, she d-died when I was nineteen. Car accident.”\\n\\n Zoey’s lips parted and her face filled with sympathy. She wasn’t even aware how much my grandmother had meant to me, but she knew... somehow sensed how hard I’d taken her death.\\n\\n “I’m so sorry.” She sat her hand on my arm before letting it fall away. I instantly missed it the moment her touch was gone, wanting her fingers to return, to comfort me some more. “You don’t usually see... I mean, grandparents are supposed to go from natural causes, not—”\\n\\n “I know,” I said, shaking my head. “Gran was so full of life too. She had plenty of years left in her. A strong heart. Yeah... That’s why they took it. She was an organ donor, and they used her heart to put into someone else who needed it.”\\n\\n Zoey’s green eyes widened. “Wow.”\\n\\n I nodded in agreement and glanced across the campus at all the people milling by, and the trees sprouting flowers and leaves...at life abounding. “I love knowing her heart is still out there, beating. Giving someone else a second chance.”\\n\\n Zoey bobbed her head too, and then quickly dashed a tear off her cheek. “It is pretty amazing.”\\n\\n “That’s when I knew I wanted to be a part of that process. I wanted to put hearts into people who needed them.”\\n\\n It took me a second to realize she was no longer next to me. But when I glanced over for her reaction, she was gone. “Zo—?” I turned back to realize she’d stopped in her shoes and was staring at me as if I’d lost my mind. “What’s wrong?” I immediately backtracked to her and took her elbow. “Are you okay?” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-55.html","bookId":2703,"book":{"id":2703,"title":"With Every Heartbeat (Forbidden Men #4)","description":"Storyline: I used to think everything was black and white, truth or lie, easy or hard, that if I could just escape my strict, overbearing, abusive father, my life would be perfect. But since I’ve found a reason to risk his wrath and leave, to help a friend in need, I’ve come to realize everything I thought I knew is wrong. \\n Friends have their own agenda, honesty comes with a dosage of lie, easy doesn’t even exist, keeping secrets sucks, and love...love is the most painful thing of all. \\n Maybe if Quinn Hamilton hadn’t asked me to skip classes for the day and help him pick out an engagement ring for my best friend, I wouldn’t have fallen for him so completely on that sunny Tuesday afternoon and I wouldn’t feel so conflicted. But I did, and I can’t take it back, no matter how hard I try. So I have to deal with the fact that even I’m not as good, or honest, or caring as I’d always thought I was, and no matter what I do next, someone’s going to get hurt. Probably me. \\n -Zoey Blakeland\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}}
