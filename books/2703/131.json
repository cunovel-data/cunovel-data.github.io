I fumbled with my jeans, zipping them down and then tugging them off my hips while Quinn whipped my bra off within seconds. Then he grabbed the heels of my boots and pulled them both off at the same time before helping me fling my pants over his shoulder. “God, you are so perfect.” His eyes gleamed as he had me lie down on my back with my legs hanging off the side of the table. The chill against my butt and spine fled the moment he hooked one of my legs under his arm and then slid his hand in his pants only to come out with his thick cock ready to impale. “And look at these beautiful swollen petals.” He slid the head of his shaft up along my folds. “You’re already blooming, all wet and ready for me.” My breasts were so sensitive and hard as they heaved up and down from my chest. “I’ve been wet for you since last Friday.” He lifted his attention, his gaze intent on my expression. “Is that why you changed your mind about us? Because of this.” I shook my head. “No.” His face flooded with joy and he shoved inside me, making me cry out and bow my back off the table. “Okay, maybe a little,” I revised, panting when he paused half way in me. One eyebrow lifted. “Only a little, you say?” “Please,” I begged. “Quinn, please. A lot, okay. A lot. All of it. I need all of it, in all of me. Deeper.” I reached out for his hips, hoping to catch him and force him forward, but he just smiled and shook his head. Then he closed his eyes, waited a beat, and whispered, “Okay. Now.” He opened his lashes just as he thrust forward, breaching the rest of me. My pussy clenched around him, so hungry for his presence it began to contract. “Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.” He started moving, and that was it for me. I came all around him, screaming, and begging, and thrashing for more. He stroked me through my orgasm, stretching me from the inside and massaging me with his thumb from the outside. It wasn’t until I came down, panting and limp, that I realized he was still going. I opened my eyes. “You’re still…” He grinned, even though his eyes were glazed, and his forehead was damp. “I love watching you come. How many times do you think we can get you to come before we leave this table?” “Uh…” I had no idea, but I think he wanted to find out. After running his hands up the outsides of my thighs, he clamped my legs together and bent them up until they were almost touching my chest. When he began to move again, the change in how he felt inside me from this new position made my eyes widen. “Oh, that’s… Oh, wow.” Quinn chuckled and leaned in a little against me so my body was supporting some of his. Then he cupped my breasts and finally gave them his attention. “Ohmigod!” I jerked from the intense sensation and bumped my head back against the table as I panted through the pleasure. “I love your breasts.” His gaze was drawn to them as his hands massaged and his fingers plucked at the pearled nipples. “They fit my hands so perfectly. I want to fit one in my mouth.” He leaned in and sucked one tip into his mouth, which essentially made his large body press in closer and force my legs to stay where he’d put them, trapping me as he assaulted me with his cock and tongue. I gripped his hair, not able to do much else but feel and cry out my next orgasm when I came again. “One more,” Quinn whispered into my ear as soon as I began to wilt from the last high he’d given me. I shook my head, unable to believe I could last one more time, but he parted my legs so he could wedge his big body right up against mine. Then he pressed his forehead to mine so he could look into my eyes. I think we shared everything in that moment. We breathed in the same air, intertwined our fingers so the sweat from our palms was the same, and we began to convulse together. Then we watched each other’s stunned expressions while our orgasm flourished between us. When it was over and the calm returned, I cupped his face in my hands. His lashes flickered open. We were eyeball to eyeball when I said, “This is why I came back.” I brushed his hair across his forehead. “Because you’re you, and I couldn’t stay away from you.” He kissed me, softly and gently, nothing but lips on lips, then nose rubbing against nose. “I’m glad you did, because I wasn’t sure how I was going to be able to stay away from you.” I woke the next morning to Quinn’s naked butt right in my face. And then he bent over.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-131.html","bookId":2703,"book":{"id":2703,"title":"With Every Heartbeat (Forbidden Men #4)","description":"Storyline: I used to think everything was black and white, truth or lie, easy or hard, that if I could just escape my strict, overbearing, abusive father, my life would be perfect. But since I’ve found a reason to risk his wrath and leave, to help a friend in need, I’ve come to realize everything I thought I knew is wrong. Friends have their own agenda, honesty comes with a dosage of lie, easy doesn’t even exist, keeping secrets sucks, and love...love is the most painful thing of all. Maybe if Quinn Hamilton hadn’t asked me to skip classes for the day and help him pick out an engagement ring for my best friend, I wouldn’t have fallen for him so completely on that sunny Tuesday afternoon and I wouldn’t feel so conflicted. But I did, and I can’t take it back, no matter how hard I try. So I have to deal with the fact that even I’m not as good, or honest, or caring as I’d always thought I was, and no matter what I do next, someone’s going to get hurt. Probably me. -Zoey Blakeland","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}}
