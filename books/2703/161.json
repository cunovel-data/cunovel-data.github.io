She turned to Caroline. “I’m done here.” She started for the door, but something in the box Asher held caught her attention.\n She stopped and began to reach for one of her tattered notebooks.\n “Don’t—” I stepped toward her, but she’d already realized what the mess was. With a gasp, she curled her hand back to her chest. When tears filled her eyes, I couldn’t handle her pain. “Zoey.” I touched her shoulder, but she whirled away and rushed from the apartment with Caroline hot on her heels.\n Feeling rejected, I panted out a breath before turning slowly toward the two Wilders who’d just destroyed my Zoey. Cora’s father managed to look contrite, but Cora lifted her chin, daring me to say something.\n “If you ever talk to her or me again—”\n “You won’t have to worry about that,” her father cut me off, his gaze narrowing on Cora. “As soon as the transplant’s complete, she’ll be coming back home…” Cora opened her mouth to object, but he kept talking over her, “…unless she wants me to cut off her monthly stipend.” When she gasped, he met her gaze. “Remember, Cora. You don’t have any control over your trust fund until you’re thirty.”\n “You bastard.” Tears immediately filled her eyes. “Zoey was right. I think I’d rather have been raised by an abusive asshole too.” Huffing out her anger, she spun around and stomped back to her room, where she slammed her door.\n Her father glanced at us remaining men. I glared back, and he cleared his throat. “Do you boys need help carrying any of those boxes?” he asked.\n I don’t know how he did it, but Ten found out where Belcher was before the night was up. It was after two in the morning, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t getting any sleep until that bastard paid for what he’d done.\n He’d left the after-party for the football players and was at a frat house. When we found him, he had his hand up some girl’s skirt. Ten had filled me in on a few more details on the way over, only enraging me more when he mentioned where he’d seen Belcher putting his hands on Zoey.\n That hand he pulled out of the girl’s skirt when we barged into the room was the first thing I was going to break. The girl he was with now looked wasted but she was giggling, so at least he hadn’t been forcing this one to do anything. Which only made me angrier. Why had he tried to force Zoey, then?\n “Hey again, Belchie.” Ten grinned cheerfully and waved a few fingers. “Guess what? I found that boyfriend you were looking for earlier. You remember Quinn Hamilton, right?”\n Belcher’s eyes widened as I advanced toward him. He tried to crawl off the bed but got tangled in the sheets and fell over backwards onto the floor. I helped him up, by the hair.\n “I didn’t know. I didn’t know,” he sobbed, lifting his hands in surrender. “I swear to God, I didn’t know she was yours.”\n “So that made you think you had free reign to kiss her while she tried to fight you off, free reign to hit her, to put your fucking hand down her pants?” I grabbed his wrist. “This hand?”\n He screamed when I slammed his hand into the wall, then he screamed even louder when I slammed his head into it next. I remembered seeing the bruise on Zoey’s cheek at Cora’s apartment, so I made sure Belcher had more than a few on his cheeks. Ten had told me Zoey had racked him between the legs, but I didn’t think one hit to the junk was enough. Not nearly enough. So I kneed him there a few times before I planted my fist in his gut. Just when his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he began to crumble, I hit him one last time in the jaw.\n But that didn’t satisfy me. I wanted to hit him more. I wanted to hurt him more. I stared down at his unconscious body I’d watched fall to my feet, and my knuckles cracked, thirsty for more blood, more crunching bone, more give of unwilling flesh.\n Blood roaring through my system, I turned to Asher, Noel and Ten, who were simply standing back and watching the show with appreciation. “That wasn’t enough,” I growled.\n Noel nodded his understanding.\n They took me to the university athletics facility to work off some of my adrenaline rush and beat down some of my steam. I lifted weights, I ran laps, I took on a punching bag, but I was too fired up to stop, aching to hit something…someone.\n For a while, Noel and Ten kept pace with me and worked out beside me without saying a word. Asher didn’t even bother to try. He camped out on the floor, pulled out his phone, and started to play some game that beeped a lot. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-161.html","bookId":2703,"book":{"id":2703,"title":"With Every Heartbeat (Forbidden Men #4)","description":"Storyline: \n I used to think everything was black and white, truth or lie, easy or hard, that if I could just escape my strict, overbearing, abusive father, my life would be perfect. But since I’ve found a reason to risk his wrath and leave, to help a friend in need, I’ve come to realize everything I thought I knew is wrong. \n Friends have their own agenda, honesty comes with a dosage of lie, easy doesn’t even exist, keeping secrets sucks, and love...love is the most painful thing of all. \n Maybe if Quinn Hamilton hadn’t asked me to skip classes for the day and help him pick out an engagement ring for my best friend, I wouldn’t have fallen for him so completely on that sunny Tuesday afternoon and I wouldn’t feel so conflicted. But I did, and I can’t take it back, no matter how hard I try. So I have to deal with the fact that even I’m not as good, or honest, or caring as I’d always thought I was, and no matter what I do next, someone’s going to get hurt. Probably me. \n -Zoey Blakeland\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}}
