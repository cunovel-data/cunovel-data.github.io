After Caroline seated herself beside Reese, I hesitated. It didn’t feel as if I belonged with these people. They were so nice and full of outgoing vivacity. I felt like a great big blah of an outsider.\\n\\n Pick glanced at me and held out a hand. “Need some help up?”\\n\\n “Oh!” I gulped, touched by his invitation. No matter how I felt, though, it seemed they were accepting me with a warm welcome. Unable to turn him down, I took his hand and stepped onto the bottom rung before hoisting myself up next to Caroline. “Thank you.”\\n\\n “Now there’s a sight for sore eyes,” Pick said, glancing appreciatively down the counter at the five of us women. “You ladies sure know how to decorate my nightclub.” He paused in front of Eva to give her another kiss before he wandered toward Asher, who was lingering around the base of the stage and fiddling with a few wires.\\n\\n One of the waitresses had unlocked the doors. A doorman had appeared somewhere and was letting a line of people in through the entrance. And the place was beginning to fill.\\n\\n “Any of you ladies thirsty?” Noel asked. “I know the only one here not underage is Aspen, so…can I get you some sodas?”\\n\\n Caroline groaned and rolled her eyes, while Reese said, “Mason can get my drink.”\\n\\n “Mine too,” Eva was quick to add.\\n\\n When Caroline opened her mouth, her brother pointed at her warningly. “No way. You’re just getting soda.”\\n\\n As she scowled and narrowed her eyes, I spoke up. “I’ll take a Sprite.”\\n\\n Noel grinned approvingly at me before glancing pointedly at his sister. Her shoulder slumped as she mumbled, “One for me too, I guess.”\\n\\n We’d just gotten our drinks and were slurping from the straws when Caroline tensed beside me. “Oh God. Oren’s here,” she said under her breath as she leaned in close.\\n\\n I turned to watch the bouncer let him into the club. A pair of guys immediately jumped on him from behind and greeted him with tackles and laughs.\\n\\n “I can’t believe he came tonight since he doesn’t have to work.” Poor Caroline. She seemed so tense and on edge as she fiddled with her straw and watched every move he made.\\n\\n “Maybe he wanted to see the band perform too.”\\n\\n She didn’t answer, probably hadn’t even heard me.\\n\\n So I watched him too as he made his way through the crowd. I was a little jealous how personable he was. He seemed to know everyone, girls and guys alike. When one girl he greeted lifted up onto her tiptoes to whisper something into his ear and make him grin, I reached out and grasped Caroline’s hand. She clutched my fingers for dear life.\\n\\n He finally noticed us when he turned toward the bar, or maybe it was the row of five women sitting on the countertop that caught his attention. But his gaze lingered on Caroline before he ordered a bottled beer from Noel.\\n\\n Finally, he approached us, swaggering closer. I thought Caroline was going to squeeze my fingers clean off.\\n\\n “Well, if isn’t a whole row of untouchables,” he mused, glancing down at the five of us as he took a sip. He looked almost sad as his gaze slid over Caroline and kept going.\\n\\n But Eva cheerfully called, “Ten-Ten, what’re you talking about untouchables? You can come over here and touch me any time you want. If you get too inappropriate, my man’ll just knock your head off.”\\n\\n “Invitation accepted.” He moved to her. “Hey, Milk Tits. You still breastfeeding those kids of yours?”\\n\\n She rolled her eyes but perked out her chest. “What do you think?”\\n\\n “Oh, yeah.” He laughed and rested his arm on her leg as he drank his beer and gazed out into the gathering crowd. He didn’t seem to be in any hurry to leave, which didn’t help ease Caroline’s grip on my hand at all.\\n\\n Yikes. I wondered how long it’d take for permanent damage to set in since there was obviously no blood circulating to my fingertips.\\n\\n “Zoey? Is that you?”\\n\\n I glanced around at the call and blinked when I saw Cora.\\n\\n “Hey!” She climbed up onto the bar beside me and engulfed me in a huge hug, which I stiffly returned. The last time I’d seen her, she’d been threatening me to stay away from her boyfriend. And now...now apparently we were back to being friends.\\n\\n Bipolar much?\\n\\n “I didn’t know you were coming tonight,” she called over the growing noise of the club.\\n\\n “Yeah, I...Caroline invited me,” I said, then I couldn’t help but glance over her shoulder, looking for him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-76.html","bookId":2703,"book":{"id":2703,"title":"With Every Heartbeat (Forbidden Men #4)","description":"Storyline: I used to think everything was black and white, truth or lie, easy or hard, that if I could just escape my strict, overbearing, abusive father, my life would be perfect. But since I’ve found a reason to risk his wrath and leave, to help a friend in need, I’ve come to realize everything I thought I knew is wrong. \\n Friends have their own agenda, honesty comes with a dosage of lie, easy doesn’t even exist, keeping secrets sucks, and love...love is the most painful thing of all. \\n Maybe if Quinn Hamilton hadn’t asked me to skip classes for the day and help him pick out an engagement ring for my best friend, I wouldn’t have fallen for him so completely on that sunny Tuesday afternoon and I wouldn’t feel so conflicted. But I did, and I can’t take it back, no matter how hard I try. So I have to deal with the fact that even I’m not as good, or honest, or caring as I’d always thought I was, and no matter what I do next, someone’s going to get hurt. Probably me. \\n -Zoey Blakeland\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}}
