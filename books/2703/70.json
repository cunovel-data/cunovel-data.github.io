{"id":73240,"no":70,"title":"Page 70","content":"“Sorry.” I winced in genuine apology. “But I’m going over to Caroline’s straight after class.”\n Caroline wanted me to go to the show with her tonight and watch the newest bartender at Forbidden sing with his band for the first time. It’d also be a first for me. It’d be the first time I’d step inside a bar. We were supposed to go to her place this afternoon after classes and get ready together.\n “Where’s Quinn?” I asked, thinking Cora could ride to class with him since he’d stayed the night.\n But that question made her eyes narrow. “He had to leave early for his morning weight training session.”\n I winced. He’d gotten off work at two thirty last night, and then stayed up later to help me. And then he had to go in early for weight lifting? I suddenly had no reason whatsoever to complain about being tired. Poor guy.\n Stepping between me and the door, Cora crossed her arms over her chest. “Well, I was going to have this discussion in the car, but since you obviously already have plans...” She sneered the word as if she couldn’t believe I’d make my own plans. It made me feel guilty because I was here in this town for her, to make sure she stayed healthy. What was I doing, going out with Caroline to football games and concerts?\n “Are you okay?” I asked, immediately concerned. “Did one of your tests—”\n “I’m fine.” She rolled her eyes and sighed. “This is about Quinn.”\n I blinked, totally confused. “Quinn?”\n “Yes! Your crush on my boyfriend is getting a little ridiculous.”\n Not at all expecting her to say that, I stumbled back a step and pressed my hand to my heart. “Wha—no... Excuse me?”\n I couldn’t even believe...\n Yeah, I was too flabbergasted to think.\n “I mean, it was cute at first,” Cora went on in the most conversational tone as my jaw dropped farther and farther. “This is probably the first time you’ve actually liked someone from the opposite gender. Right? I mean, for a while there, in high school, I thought you were a lesbian and into me, but...no...from the way you watch my boyfriend, like all the time, it’s obvious you’re definitely into guys. I just hope you know you could never have him.”\n “I...I...” Heat infused my face...and my chest...and my stomach. I didn’t even know what to say to that. So I fumbled out a few more unintelligible words before sputtering, “Oh my God, Cora. I have never...not even once thought your boyfriend would—”\n “Good,” Cora said perkily, clasping her hands together. “Because even if you tried, he’d never go for someone like you. He’s into much more knowledgeable, sophisticated women. Naive, gullible little innocents just aren’t to his taste.”\n My heart flopped heavily into my stomach, not only because it hurt to hear how I could never get a guy like Quinn because I was too...me, but just knowing she felt the need to warn me away from him, as if she thought I’d even try to steal him from her, was just...yeah. Insane.\n “I don’t know why you even feel the need to say this to me.” I shook my head. “You know me! I’d never...ever...”\n “You’re right.” Cora smiled as if pleased. She patted my arm and stepped aside to let me go. “I do know better. I guess I was just getting a little possessive of the man I love.”\n Hearing her say the L-word rattled me more than I cared to admit, and I had to look at anything but her while I nodded, agreeing with her assessment.\n “Thank goodness that’s all settled then. Have fun at school.”\n I shook my head, feeling more unsettled than ever before. I stared at her a moment, then I had to say, “I think you should tell him, though. He deserves to know. Quinn is a really good—”\n Cora lifted her fingers to stop me mid-word. Then she narrowed her gaze. “Yes, he is a really good guy. But he’s my guy. Not yours. It’s completely my decision what I do with him and what I tell him.” She stepped threateningly closer. “And if you ever even think about interfering with that, or telling him what I don’t wish for him to know, you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. Understand?”\n I couldn’t even respond to that. I simply brushed past her and hurried from the apartment. But I felt cold, deep inside, all the way to school.\n What was worse, Quinn was already in art class, sitting in the chair next to mine when I arrived. And then he had to go and smile at me as if he were happy to see me.\n “Hey, did you get the super called this morning?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-70.html","bookId":2703,"book":{"id":2703,"title":"With Every Heartbeat (Forbidden Men #4)","description":"Storyline: \n I used to think everything was black and white, truth or lie, easy or hard, that if I could just escape my strict, overbearing, abusive father, my life would be perfect. But since I’ve found a reason to risk his wrath and leave, to help a friend in need, I’ve come to realize everything I thought I knew is wrong. \n Friends have their own agenda, honesty comes with a dosage of lie, easy doesn’t even exist, keeping secrets sucks, and love...love is the most painful thing of all. \n Maybe if Quinn Hamilton hadn’t asked me to skip classes for the day and help him pick out an engagement ring for my best friend, I wouldn’t have fallen for him so completely on that sunny Tuesday afternoon and I wouldn’t feel so conflicted. But I did, and I can’t take it back, no matter how hard I try. So I have to deal with the fact that even I’m not as good, or honest, or caring as I’d always thought I was, and no matter what I do next, someone’s going to get hurt. Probably me. \n -Zoey Blakeland\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}}
