I seared my buddy with a glare. “Way to go, asshole.” “What?” He gaped at Blondie as if she was some kind of alien. “What did I say?” “Just...” I waved him away. “Go tell Ham we’re ready to leave now, will you?” I woke with the headache from hell splitting through the center of my cranium. A whimper later, I squeezed my eyes shut and clutched my temples, wishing to be put out of my misery. “Morning, lover,” a voice cooed in my ear and a hand slid up my bare thigh. Cora rubbed against me, her naked breasts crushing my bicep. “I’ve been waiting for you to wake up.” I tried to unstick my dried tongue from the roof of my mouth. “What...what time is it?” “Too late for you to make pancakes, but that’s okay.” Five very greedy fingers curled around my morning wood. “I’d rather have sausage anyway.” My eyes nearly crossed as the pain in my head mixed with the pleasure spreading from my groin. “You were so amazing last night,” Cora murmured in my ear just before she nipped the lobe with her teeth. “Do you remember how awesome it was?” No. I blinked up at the ceiling, trying to remember last night at all. But I came up with a big blank nothing. Why couldn’t I remember what had happened? “Best night of my entire life.” My girlfriend moaned as she pumped me a little faster. I reached out and caught her around the waist, discovering she was as naked as I was. She mewed when I slid my hand over her bottom. Then I urged her to slide on top of me, and she was more than willing to climb onto my lap. Cora found a condom and was sliding it into place before I could even go searching for one myself. And then she was lowering herself onto me. Twenty minutes later, we were both still panting, she was sprawled against my chest, too bonelessly weary to move, and I still couldn’t remember a single detail from the night before. “Okay,” I finally admitted. “I don’t remember last night at all.” I began to rub her back, hoping she didn’t get upset because whatever had happened last night had set her off this morning until she’d been chanting how much she loved me just five minutes ago when she’d come...for the second time. But instead of getting mad, she laughed and rubbed her nose against my throat. “Yeah, you did have a bit much to drink.” My eyes opened wide. “I drank?” A sudden vision hit me of downing a big gulp and then laughing at something I said to a girl...except the girl I’d been laughing with hadn’t been Cora. At least, I don’t think it’d been Cora. I swear, it’d been Zoey. But I’d been leaning into her until we were almost touching as I’d laughed, which couldn’t be right. “Why was I drinking?” “Ten talked you into it, or something. I don’t know.” “Ten?” Oh. Right. The double date. I winced, hoping Zoey had fared okay with Ten, since I obviously hadn’t been in the right frame of mind to keep him in line. “You and Zoey both got plastered.” My eyebrows crinkled. “We did?” Now that just sounded weird. Cora started kissing her way down my chest. “Yep. And then you sang to me on the karaoke.” My eyes widened. “What?” “Then you danced with me until we came home and made love for the rest of the night. I’ve never seen you so insatiable before. It was like you just couldn’t get enough of me.” I flushed, wishing I could remember that. But then another flashing memory popped into my head. I’d been squeezing my eyes closed as I gasped for breath and pounded hard and without finesse into a woman. I’d been thinking about Zoey, though. My gaze sprang guiltily to Cora. I’d been thinking about her roommate while I’d been inside her. That had to be the absolute worst thing I’d ever done. I wanted to apologize and beg her forgiveness, but no way did I want to actually confess to her what I’d done...or why I hadn’t been able to “get enough of her” last night. Oh God. I think I needed to throw up. “You were, like, the man I always knew you could be.” Cora rolled off me to curl against my side. Gazing lovingly at me, she kept running her hand up and down my chest. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn’t tell her. There was no point. It’d only hurt her, and I couldn’t take it back now. Wishing I could do something—anything—to make it up to Cora, I rolled toward her and nuzzled my nose into her neck, breathing in her scent and silently apologizing for picturing someone else while I should’ve been concentrating on nothing but her. She purred at my apologetic cuddling and clutched handfuls of my hair.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-89.html","bookId":2703,"book":{"id":2703,"title":"With Every Heartbeat (Forbidden Men #4)","description":"Storyline: I used to think everything was black and white, truth or lie, easy or hard, that if I could just escape my strict, overbearing, abusive father, my life would be perfect. But since I’ve found a reason to risk his wrath and leave, to help a friend in need, I’ve come to realize everything I thought I knew is wrong. Friends have their own agenda, honesty comes with a dosage of lie, easy doesn’t even exist, keeping secrets sucks, and love...love is the most painful thing of all. Maybe if Quinn Hamilton hadn’t asked me to skip classes for the day and help him pick out an engagement ring for my best friend, I wouldn’t have fallen for him so completely on that sunny Tuesday afternoon and I wouldn’t feel so conflicted. But I did, and I can’t take it back, no matter how hard I try. So I have to deal with the fact that even I’m not as good, or honest, or caring as I’d always thought I was, and no matter what I do next, someone’s going to get hurt. Probably me. -Zoey Blakeland","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}}
