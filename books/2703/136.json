{"id":73306,"no":136,"title":"Page 136","content":"“When you look at me like that, I feel like a helpless little fly caught in your web.” His confession caused a laugh to blurt from me. I was the one caught and entranced under his spell. “Do I hear another biology lesson coming?” I asked. His grin exploded across his face. “The spider builds his web to catch his food.” I groaned and covered my face as if I hated his biology lessons, when actually I loved them. He ran his fingers up the insides of my thighs. “As soon as his victim comes along and gets caught in his web, he strikes.” I yelped when Quinn’s arms snaked around my legs and wrapped around me. His naughty grin grew. “After he binds his silk around his little fly so she can’t possibly escape, he bites her with his venom.” Quinn sank his teeth into me, right between my legs with a playful kind of nip. I groaned and buried my fingers in his hair, pulling taut at his scalp when his tongue licked across my clit. He killed me with his mouth, massaging that sensitive little bundle of nerves until I was squirming against him, so close to the brink that I didn’t care how hard I was pulling his hair now, or that I might’ve hurt his back when I wrapped one leg around his shoulder and dug the heel of my foot into his spine. When he plunged two fingers into me, I lost it. I was loud and unashamed by what a commotion I made, because the louder I got the more enthused and hungry he turned. I loved that. I wanted him ravenous. When I finally breathed out a drained breath, he broke his mouth from my pussy and wiped the back of his hand across his red, swollen lips. His blue eyes were especially bright when they met mine. His gaze told me how amazing he thought I was, how much he loved being here with me like this, how precious this moment was to him. But he didn’t verbalize any of that. He didn’t have to. Instead, he said it in his own way…his geeked-out, biology-loving way. “So after the spider injects his venom, he retreats a safe distance to let her die.” “Check,” I murmured in a dazed voice as I remained collapsed against the wall. “I definitely feel limp enough to be half dead.” Quinn’s smile was as deadly as it was smugly adorable when he glanced up from stepping out of his boxer shorts. My gaze went directly to his cock as it bobbed away from him, hard and long and so freaking thick. The droplet of pre-cum beading from the head made my mouth water. “Did you know the French call an orgasm la petite mort, the little death? Because of that near state of unconsciousness after coming so hard?” I shook my head, watching the flash of his white canines and remembering what they’d just done to me. “No,” I said, “but it makes sense.” I could die a happy girl right about now. Setting one hand on the wall, he used the other to take himself in hand and guide his cock to me. “But back to your lesson. Spider venom not only kills his victim, but it also liquefies all her organs because he can’t process solid foods.”’ Oh, yeah. He’d definitely liquefied my insides. I felt like nothing but a gooey pile of mush. But I was so far past creepy, crawly spider talk. When Quinn Hamilton was touching himself, there was only one thing on my mind. “Is it bad that I’ve become obsessed with this part of you?” I asked, reaching out so I could wrap my hand around his girth. He clenched his teeth and a raspy sound exited his throat. “No,” he said as he leaned in to press his lips against my forehead as he let me play. “I like your obsession with it.” I ran my fingers over him, intrigued by the thickest vein running down the entire length. I smiled, knowing that if I asked him, he’d probably know the scientific name of that vein. His voice was strained as he squeezed his eyes closed. “Your touch is so gentle and soft.” I glanced up and studied his face as I gripped him again and slowly pumped him. “Is that bad?” “No. But it’s driving me insane. You can…you can be rougher…if you want.” “Rougher?” I repeated, very interested by the idea. I could tell by his expression that rougher was exactly what he wanted. “Why you naughty, naughty boy,” I leaned in to whisper into his ear. “Show me how rough you want it.” He growled and instantly covered my hand, squeezing my fingers harder around his erection. Then he picked up the speed, helping me jerk him off. “Oh God.” I squeezed my legs together as I watched. “I think I’m going to come again.” “You better believe you are.” Abruptly letting go of my hand, he gripped my hips and lifted me higher against the wall. I squeaked in surprise and let go of his cock to grip his shoulders. As soon as he had me positioned where he wanted me, he thrust forward, impaling me at an angle that had me crying out and instantly constricting around him. It was rough and fast and utterly amazing.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-136.html","bookId":2703,"book":{"id":2703,"title":"With Every Heartbeat (Forbidden Men #4)","description":"Storyline: I used to think everything was black and white, truth or lie, easy or hard, that if I could just escape my strict, overbearing, abusive father, my life would be perfect. But since I’ve found a reason to risk his wrath and leave, to help a friend in need, I’ve come to realize everything I thought I knew is wrong. Friends have their own agenda, honesty comes with a dosage of lie, easy doesn’t even exist, keeping secrets sucks, and love...love is the most painful thing of all. Maybe if Quinn Hamilton hadn’t asked me to skip classes for the day and help him pick out an engagement ring for my best friend, I wouldn’t have fallen for him so completely on that sunny Tuesday afternoon and I wouldn’t feel so conflicted. But I did, and I can’t take it back, no matter how hard I try. So I have to deal with the fact that even I’m not as good, or honest, or caring as I’d always thought I was, and no matter what I do next, someone’s going to get hurt. Probably me. -Zoey Blakeland","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}}
