I love it. Congratulations by the way. You better name your firstborn after me.”\n I curled my arms around Quinn’s neck as he carried me from the kitchen and back to his room.\n “I’m sorry,” he murmured regretfully in my ear and then kissed my cheek. “Do you want me to throw him out?”\n “No.” I pressed my mouth to his neck because he smelled so good there...and I just had to have my mouth on him. Plus, his caveman carrying kind of turned me on. “I actually liked hearing that someone likes me more than her.”\n He groaned and caught my face so he could mash his mouth against mine. “I like you more than her, too. I crave you so much it’s all I can think about. All I want. Maybe all I need.”\n I didn’t get a chance to respond because he pressed his tongue in and I grew too obsessed with craving him right back. We parted only long enough for him to lay me on the bed and crawl onto the mattress with me.\n “Is it bad if I grew hard the moment he said pussy? I instantly envisioned yours, and then I wanted inside it.”\n I gulped, watching him rip off my jeans. “Only if it’s bad that hearing you say that makes me wet.”\n With a grin, he hiked up the shirt I was wearing. Then he ripped off the panties I’d put on to make breakfast, tearing them to smithereens. “I don’t mind being bad with you.” Dipping his face between my legs, he slid his tongue inside me and showed me just how good bad could be.\n I snuck over to Quinn’s apartment on Sunday night after he texted to tell me Ten was working and he was home alone. It was my first booty call¸ I realized, and it made me giddy as I stole up the stairs to his apartment.\n He looked similarly excited as he opened the door for me and let me in. His blue eyes sparkled with mischief and he bit his lip as he took my hand and pulled me inside and closed the door behind me.\n “Did you have any problems getting here?” he asked, his voice hushed.\n I shook my head. All he was doing was holding my hand and I wanted to attack him, but I only shifted a step closer. “I was home alone too, so no one noticed me leaving.”\n His grin spread and he tipped his head as if he was going to kiss me, but he didn’t. “Good,” he whispered.\n I couldn’t handle it. I lifted my fingers and touched his face, grazing my nails over his dimple. “Why’re we whispering?” I had to ask, my voice just as quiet and conspiring as his. “I thought you said Ten was working tonight.”\n “He is.” Quinn dipped in closer until our brows brushed. “But it feels naughtier to talk like this, like we’re sneaking around.” His eyes fluttered as if he was going to close them, but he didn’t. Then he glanced his cheek off mine and admitted in a soft, husky voice directly into my ear. “I like feeling naughty with you.”\n Lifting my second hand, I cupped his face in my palms before slipping them up his jaw and dipping my fingers into his hair and then grasping fistfuls. Then I whispered into his ear, “You can be as naughty as you want with me.”\n A growl rumbled from his chest as he crushed his mouth to mine. His tongue speared into me, and I whimpered as he picked me up by the bottom and spun me around to press my back against the wall and anchor me there while his lips attacked mine.\n We couldn’t get enough, grappling and tugging at each other’s clothes, teeth nipping at the other’s skin, hands unable to stop gripping and tearing.\n “I want to do you right here against this wall,” he rasped into my ear as he tugged my panties, the last of my clothes, down my legs.\n I was in no condition to deny him anything, so I just nodded, staring down at him with wide, amazed eyes as he knelt in front of me to help me step out of my underwear. He lingered down there, and I squirmed a little inside, remembering how his tongue felt on me. I was so wet it was embarrassing. And yet thrilling.\n A long breath escaped him as he looked up and met my gaze. “You are so beautiful,” he murmured.\n My heart fluttered in my chest and I didn’t know how to answer. His gaze captured me as if he knew he possessed every freaking molecule of my being. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-135.html","bookId":2703,"book":{"id":2703,"title":"With Every Heartbeat (Forbidden Men #4)","description":"Storyline: \n I used to think everything was black and white, truth or lie, easy or hard, that if I could just escape my strict, overbearing, abusive father, my life would be perfect. But since I’ve found a reason to risk his wrath and leave, to help a friend in need, I’ve come to realize everything I thought I knew is wrong. \n Friends have their own agenda, honesty comes with a dosage of lie, easy doesn’t even exist, keeping secrets sucks, and love...love is the most painful thing of all. \n Maybe if Quinn Hamilton hadn’t asked me to skip classes for the day and help him pick out an engagement ring for my best friend, I wouldn’t have fallen for him so completely on that sunny Tuesday afternoon and I wouldn’t feel so conflicted. But I did, and I can’t take it back, no matter how hard I try. So I have to deal with the fact that even I’m not as good, or honest, or caring as I’d always thought I was, and no matter what I do next, someone’s going to get hurt. Probably me. \n -Zoey Blakeland\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}}
