The car is parked in front of Jenny Masterson\u0027s house.\" Augustus Brine stormed into the house carrying a grocery bag in each arm.\\n\\n Gian Hen Gian was in the kitchen pouring salt from a round, blue box into a pitcher of Koolaid.\\n\\n Brine set the bags down on the hearth. \"Help me bring some of this stuff in. There\u0027s more bags in the truck.\"\\n\\n The genie walked to the fireplace and looked in the bags. One was filled with dry-cell batteries and spools of wire. The other was full of brown cardboard cylinders about four inches long and an inch in diameter. Gian Hen Gian took one of the cylinders out of the bag and held it up. A green, waterproof fuse extended from one end.\\n\\n \"What are these?\"\\n\\n \"Seal bombs,\" Brine said. \"The Department of Fish and Game distributes them to fishermen to scare seals away from their lines and nets. I had a bunch at the store.\"\\n\\n \"Explosives are useless against the demon.\"\\n\\n \"There are five more bags in the truck. Would you bring them in, please?\" Brine began to lay the seal bombs out in a line on the hearth. \"I don\u0027t know how much time we have.\"\\n\\n \"What am I, some scrounging servant? Am I a beast of burden? Should I, Gian Hen Gian, king of the Djinn, be reduced to bearing loads for an ignorant mortal who would attack a demon from hell with firecrackers?\"\\n\\n \"O King,\" Brine said, exasperated, \"please bring in the goddamn bags so I can finish this before dawn.\"\\n\\n \"It is useless.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to try to blow him up. I just want to know where he is. Unless you can use your great power to restrain him, O King of the Djinn.\"\\n\\n \"You know I cannot.\"\\n\\n \"The bags!\"\\n\\n \"You are a stupid, mean-spirited man, Augustus Brine. I\u0027ve seen more intelligence in the crotch lice of harem whores.\"\\n\\n The genie walked out the door and his diatribe faded into the night. Brine was methodically wrapping the fuses of the seal bombs with thin monofilament silver wire designed to heat up when a current was applied. It was an inexact method of detonation, but Brine had no access to blasting caps at this hour of the morning.\\n\\n The genie returned in a moment carrying two grocery bags.\\n\\n \"Put them on the chairs.\" Brine gestured with his head.\\n\\n \"These bags are filled with flour,\" Gian Hen Gian said. \"Are you going to bake bread, Augustus Brine?\"\\n\\n 22\\n\\n TRAVIS AND JENNY\\n\\n There was something about her that made Travis want to dump his life out on the coffee table like a pocket full of coins; let her sort through and keep what she wanted. If he was still here in the morning, he\u0027d tell her about Catch, but not now.\\n\\n \"Do you like traveling?\" Jenny asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting tired of it. I could use a break.\"\\n\\n She sipped from a glass of red wine and pulled her skirt down for the tenth time. There was still a neutral zone between them on the couch.\\n\\n She said, \"You don\u0027t seem like any insurance salesman I\u0027ve ever known. I hope you don\u0027t mind my saying, but usually insurance men dress in loud blazers and reek of cheap cologne. I\u0027ve never met one that seemed sincere about anything.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a job.\" Travis hoped she wouldn\u0027t ask about the details of his job. He didn\u0027t know a thing about insurance. He had decided on the career because Effrom Elliot had mistaken him for an insurance man that afternoon, so it was the first thing that came to mind.\\n\\n \"When I was a kid, an insurance man came to our house to sell my father some life insurance,\" Jenny said. \"He gathered the family together in front of the fireplace and took our picture with a Polaroid camera. It was a nice picture. My father was standing at one side of us all, looking proud. As we were passing the picture around, the insurance man snatched the picture out of my father\u0027s hands and said, \u0027What a nice family.\u0027 Then he ripped my father out of the picture and said, \u0027Now what will they do?\u0027 I burst into tears. My father was frightened.\"\\n\\n Travis said: \"I\u0027m sorry, Jenny.\" Perhaps he should have told her he was a brush salesman. Did she have any traumatic brush-salesman stories?\\n\\n \"Do you do that, Travis? Do you frighten people for a living?\"\\n\\n \"What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"Like I said, you don\u0027t seem like an insurance man.\"\\n\\n \"Jennifer, I need to tell you something...\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m sorry, I got a little heavy on you. You do what you do. I never thought I\u0027d be waiting tables at this age.\"\\n\\n \"What did you want to do? I mean, when you were a little girl, what did you want to be when you grew up?\"\\n\\n \"Honestly?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to be a mom. I wanted to have a family and a man who loved me and a nice house. Pretty unambitious, huh?\"\\n\\n \"No, there\u0027s nothing wrong with that. What happened?\"\\n\\n She drained her wineglass and poured herself another from the bottle on the coffee table. \"You can\u0027t have a family alone.\"\\n\\n \"But?\"\\n\\n \"Travis, I don\u0027t want to ruin the evening by talking more about my marriage. I\u0027m trying to make some changes.\"\\n\\n Travis let it go. She picked up his silence as understanding and brightened.\\n\\n \"So, what did you want to do when you grew up?\"\\n\\n \"Honestly?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell me you wanted to be a housewife, too.\"\\n\\n \"When I was growing up that\u0027s all any girl wanted to be.\"\\n\\n \"Where did you grow up, Siberia?\"\\n\\n \"Pennsylvania. I grew up on a farm.\"\\n\\n \"And what did the farm boy from Pennsylvania want to be when he grew up?\"\\n\\n \"A priest.\"\\n\\n Jenny laughed. \"I never knew anyone who wanted to be a priest. What did you do while the other boys were playing army, give last rights to the dead?\"\\n\\n \"No, it wasn\u0027t like that. My mother always wanted me to be a priest. As soon as I was old enough, I went away to seminary. It didn\u0027t work out.\"\\n\\n \"So you became an insurance man. I suppose that works. I read once that all religions and insurance companies are supported by the fear of death.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s pretty cynical,\" the demonkeeper said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Travis. I don\u0027t have much faith in the concept of an all-powerful being that would glorify war and violence.\"\\n\\n \"You should.\"\\n\\n \"Are you trying to convert me?\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s just that I know, absolutely, that God exists.\"\\n\\n \"No one knows anything absolutely. I\u0027m not without faith. I have my own beliefs, but I have my doubts, too.\"\\n\\n \"So did I.\"\\n\\n \"Did? What happened, did the Holy Spirit come to you in the night and say, \u0027Go forth and sell insurance\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that.\" Travis forced a smile.\\n\\n \"Travis, you are a very strange man.\"\\n\\n \"I really didn\u0027t want to talk about religion.\"\\n\\n \"Good. I\u0027ll tell you my beliefs in the morning. You\u0027ll be quite shocked, I\u0027m sure.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt that, I really do... Did you say \u0027in the morning\u0027?\"\\n\\n Jenny held her hand out to him. Inside she was unsure of what she was doing, but it seemed fine - at least it didn\u0027t feel wrong.\\n\\n \"Did I miss something?\" Travis asked. \"I thought you were angry with me.\"\\n\\n \"No, why would I be angry at you?\"\\n\\n \"Because of my faith.\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s cute.\"\\n\\n \"Cute? Cute! You think the Roman Catholic Church is cute? A hundred popes are rolling in their graves, Jenny.\"\\n\\n \"Good. They aren\u0027t invited. Move over here.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" he said. \"You\u0027ve had a lot of wine.\"\\n\\n She was not sure at all, nevertheless she nodded to him. She was single, right? She liked him, right? Well, hell, it was started now.\\n\\n He slid down the couch to her side and took her in his arms. They kissed, awkwardly at first; he was too aware of himself and she was still wondering if she should have invited him in in the first place. He held her tighter and she arched her back and pushed against him and they both forgot their reservations. The world outside ceased to exist. When they finally broke the kiss, he buried his face in her hair and held her tight so she could not pull away and see the tears in his eyes.\\n\\n \"Jenny,\" he said softly, \"it\u0027s been a long time...\"\\n\\n She shushed him and dug her hands into his hair. \"Everything will be fine. Just fine.\"\\n\\n Perhaps it was because they were both afraid, or perhaps it was because they really didn\u0027t know each other; it might even have been that by playing a role they would not have to face anything but the moment. The roles they played throughout the night changed. First, each gave when the other needed, and later, when need was no longer an issue, they played their roles out to felicity. It progressed thusly: she was the comforter, he the comforted; then he was the understanding counselor, she the confused confessor; she became the nurse, he the patient in traction; he took the role of the naive stable boy, she the seductive duchess; he was the drill sergeant, she the raw recruit; she was the cruel master, he the helpless slave girl.\\n\\n The small hours of the morning found them naked on the kitchen floor after Travis had played a rampaging Godzilla to Jennifer\u0027s unsuspecting Tokyo. They were crouched over a cooking toaster oven, each with a table knife loaded with butter, poised like executioners waiting for the signal to drop their blades. They polished off a loaf of toast, a half-pound of butter, a quart of tofu ice cream, a box of whole wheat cream-sandwich cookies, a bag of unsalted blue corn chips, and an organically grown watermelon that gushed pink juice down their chins while they laughed.\\n\\n Stuffed, satisfied, and sticky-sweet they returned to bed and fell asleep in a warm tangle.\\n\\n Perhaps it wasn\u0027t love that they had in common; perhaps it was only a need for escape and forgetting. But they found it.\\n\\n Three hours later the alarm clock sounded and Jenny left to go wait tables at H.P.\u0027s Cafe. Travis slept dreamless, groaning and smiling when she kissed him good-bye on the forehead.\\n\\n When the explosions started, Travis woke up screaming.\\n\\n PART FOUR\\n\\n MONDAY\\n\\n The many men, so beautiful!\\n\\n And they all dead did lie:\\n\\n And a thousand slimy things\\n\\n Lived on; and so did I.\\n\\n - Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\n\\n 23\\n\\n RIVERA\\n\\n Rivera came through the trailer door followed by two uniformed officers. Robert sat up on the couch and was immediately rolled over and handcuffed. Rivera read him his Miranda rights before he was completely awake. When Robert\u0027s vision cleared, Rivera was sitting in a chair in front of him, holding a piece of paper in his face.\\n\\n \"Robert, I am Detective Sergeant Alphonse Rivera.\" A badge wallet flipped open in Rivera\u0027s other hand. \"This is a warrant for your and The Breeze\u0027s arrest. There\u0027s one here to search this trailer as well, which is what I and deputies Deforest and Perez will be doing in just a moment.\"\\n\\n A uniformed officer appeared from the far end of the trailer. \"He\u0027s not here, Sergeant.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Rivera said to the uniform. To Robert he said: \"Things will go easier for you if you tell me right now where I can find The Breeze.\"\\n\\n Robert was starting to get a foggy idea of what was going on.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re not a dealer?\" he asked sleepily.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re quick, Masterson. Where\u0027s The Breeze?\"\\n\\n \"The Breeze didn\u0027t have anything to do with it. He\u0027s been gone for two days. I took the suitcase because I wanted to know who the guy was that was with my wife.\"\\n\\n \"What suitcase?\"\\n\\n Robert nodded toward the living-room floor. The Haliburton case lay there unopened. Rivera picked it up and tried the latches.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s got a combination lock,\" Robert said. \"I couldn\u0027t get it open.\"\\n\\n Sheriff\u0027s deputies were riffling through the trailer. From the back bedroom one shouted. \"Rivera, we\u0027ve got it.\"\\n\\n \"Stay here, Robert. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\\n\\n Rivera rose and started toward the bedroom just as Perez appeared in the kitchen holding another aluminum suitcase.\\n\\n \"That it?\" Rivera asked.\\n\\n Perez, a dark Hispanic who seemed too small to be a deputy, threw the suitcase on the kitchen table and opened the lid. \"Jackpot,\" he said.\\n\\n Neat square blocks of plastic-covered green weed lay in even rows across the suitcase. Robert could smell a faint odor like skunk coming from the marijuana.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get the testing kit,\" Perez said.\\n\\n Rivera took a deep sniff and looked at Perez quizzically. \"Right, it could be just lawn clippings that they weighed out in pounds.\"\\n\\n Perez looked hurt by Rivera\u0027s sarcasm. \"But for the record?\"\\n\\n Rivera waved him away, then returned to the couch and sat down next to Robert.\\n\\n \"You are in deep trouble, my friend.\"\\n\\n \"You know,\" Robert said, \"I felt really bad about being so rude to you yesterday when you came by.\" He smiled weakly. \"I\u0027ve been going through some really hard times.\"\\n\\n \"Make it up to me, Robert. Tell me where The Breeze is.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Then you are going to eat shit for all that pot over there on the table.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t even know it was there. I thought you guys were here about the suitcase I took. The other one.\"\\n\\n \"Robert, you and I are going to go back to the station and have a really long talk. You can tell me all about the suitcase and all the folks that The Breeze has been keeping company with.\"\\n\\n \"Sergeant Rivera, I don\u0027t mean to be rude or anything, but I wasn\u0027t quite awake when you were telling me the charges... sir.\"\\n\\n Rivera helped Robert to his feet and led him out of the trailer. \"Possession of marijuana for sale and conspiracy to sell marijuana. Actually the conspiracy charge is the nastier of the two.\"\\n\\n \"So you didn\u0027t even know about the suitcase I took?\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t care less about the suitcase.\" Rivera pushed Robert into the cruiser. \"Watch your head.\"\\n\\n \"You should bring it along just to see who the guy was that it belonged to. Your guys in the lab can open it and...\"\\n\\n Rivera slammed the car door on Robert\u0027s comment. He turned to Deforest, who was coming out of the trailer. \"Grab that suitcase out of the living room and tag it.\"\\n\\n \"More pot, Sarge?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so, but the whacko seems to think it\u0027s important.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/practical-demonkeeping/page-10.html","bookId":2045,"book":{"id":2045,"title":"Practical Demonkeeping","description":"Storyline: Travis was born in 1900, yet he has not aged since 1919, because he accidentally called up a demon from hell named Catch as his servant, presumably forever.
