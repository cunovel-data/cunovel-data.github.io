{"id":23031,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. DEACON MILLER GETS A CLUE.","content":"Mark was forced to smile at the idea of old Whitey committing suicide. The deacon observed his smile, and it provoked him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you mean to say, Mark Manning, that you think the critter shot herself in the face?\" he demanded, sharply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Deacon Miller, I have no such idea.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s the same as admittin\u0027 that you shot her,\" said the deacon, triumphantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, it isn\u0027t, deacon. I didn\u0027t shoot her, but I have no doubt some one else did.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may have been the cat,\" remarked the deacon, with a return to sarcasm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was probably a two-legged cat,\" said Mark. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jest my idee!\" remarked the deacon, quickly, \"An\u0027 that brings it home to you. You was out with a gun, an\u0027 I caught you standin\u0027 beside the cow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As to catching me,\" returned Mark, \"there was no catching about it. I was crossing the pasture, and was attracted by the poor animal\u0027s moans. That is the way I happened to be near when you came up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That all sounds very smooth,\" said the deacon, impatiently, \"but if you didn\u0027t shoot the cow, who did?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think that question can be answered, Deacon Miller; John Downie!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To the deacon\u0027s surprise, John came into the room at this summons. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Johnny,\" said Mark, \"will you tell the deacon who shot his cow!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like to tell,\" objected John; \"it wasn\u0027t done on purpose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you do it?\" queried the deacon, sharply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir. I never fired a gun in my life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who did it, then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Must I tell, Mark?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Johnny; Deacon Miller has a right to know; even if it was not done on purpose, the one who did it ought to make good the loss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s where you speak sense, Mark,\" said the deacon, approvingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then it was Jim Collins.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"James Collins—the squire\u0027s son!\" repeated the deacon, astonished. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n John proceeded to tell the story once more. The deacon, it is needless to say, listened very attentively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So the boys run away, did they?\" he inquired, grimly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I s\u0027pose you\u0027d have run away, too, if you had done it, hey?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps I might,\" answered John, ingenuously. \"I s\u0027pose they were scared.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll scare \u0027em,\" growled the deacon. \"Squire Collins is able to make up the loss to me, and I mean he shall.\" Then, with a momentary suspicion, \"This ain\u0027t a story you an\u0027 Mark have got up between you, to get him off, is it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will answer that, Deacon Miller,\" said Mark firmly. \"If I had shot your cow, I wouldn\u0027t have run away, but I\u0027d have gone right to you and told you about it, and I\u0027d have paid you just as soon as I could.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, that\u0027s right,\" said the deacon, approvingly, beginning to regard Mark with more favor. \"Well, I must go and see the squire. Here, you John Downie, come along with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to go home,\" said John. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I can\u0027t prove it without you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can tell the squire that I saw it done, and am ready to swear to it, if he wants me to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebbe that\u0027ll do if I send for you, you\u0027ll come, hey?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The deacon did not feel disposed to postpone what he regarded as important business, and he left the cottage, taking the shortest direction to the squire\u0027s more imposing dwelling. We will precede him. \\n\\n \\n\\n James Collins and his friend, as already described, ran away as fast as their legs could carry them, when they ascertained what damage had been done. \\n\\n \\n\\n No one, so far as they knew, had seen them, and they hoped to escape, scot free. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tom accompanied James home, and stayed to supper. After supper the boys went out, and had a conference together. \\n\\n \\n\\n James felt a little nervous, though he believed that he was safe from incurring suspicion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wonder if the deacon has found old Whitey yet?\" said James. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess so,\" answered Tom. \"He usually goes after the cows before this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wonder how he\u0027ll think it happened?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe he\u0027ll lay it to Mark.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n James was not very much disturbed at this supposition. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That would be a good joke!\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not for Mark.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mark can take care of himself. He was out with a gun as well as we.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His mother couldn\u0027t afford to pay for the cow,\" said Tom, who was rather more considerate than his companion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s none of my business. And, Tom, there\u0027s something I want to say to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go ahead!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If Mark is accused, don\u0027t you go to saying it\u0027s a mistake. Remember it\u0027s none of your business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tom looked uncomfortable, having some conscience. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It would be rough on a poor woman like Mrs. Manning having to pay for the deacon\u0027s cow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re mighty considerate, Tom. You might consider me a little. If it were known that I shot the cow, father would make me pay at least half the bill out of my money in the savings\u0027 bank. I thought you were my friend!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you won\u0027t betray me. As for Mark, the deacon can\u0027t prove it against him, so he won\u0027t have to pay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then the deacon will lose his cow, and get no pay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He can afford it. He\u0027s a stingy old lunks, anyway.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s true enough.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And it won\u0027t ruin him if he does lose the cow. He\u0027s able to buy another.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It struck Tom, though he was not over conscientious, that this was not exactly the way to regard the matter, but he did not like to offend James, and he had ventured to oppose him more than usual already. So he remained silent. \\n\\n \\n\\n James was not quite satisfied with his friend. He was not altogether sure of his fidelity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got only one thing to say, Tom,\" he added. \"If you go back on me, and breathe a word of what happened in the pasture, I\u0027ll never speak to you again as long as I live.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s going back on you? did I say I was?\" demanded Tom rather irritably. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, then; I only wanted to have the thing understood between us, I didn\u0027t really think you would be mean enough to tell.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So a satisfactory understanding was established between the two boys, and it looked as if Mark was likely to be the victim of their alliance. \\n\\n \\n\\n But just when James was beginning to feel secure, he was startled by an apparition just looming in sight on the highway. It was not a formidable figure—that of Deacon Miller—but under the circumstances James turned pale and his heart began to beat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tom,\" he gasped; \"isn\u0027t that Deacon Miller coming up the road?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the deacon sure enough!\" answered Tom, looking disconcerted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think he\u0027s coming here?\" queried James nervously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Looks like it?\" muttered Tom. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think he can have——heard anything?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps he heard that we were out with guns?\" suggested Tom. \"He may have come to make inquiries.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just so, now, Tom, be careful not to look as if there was anything the matter. We\u0027ll be extra polite to the old fellow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He may not be coming here after all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But he was! arrived at the gate Deacon Miller paused, and opening it entered the front yard. He looked sharply at the two boys who were standing on the lawn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1828/53030.html","bookId":1019,"book":{"id":1019,"title":"Mark Manning\u0027s Mission","description":"简介： Two boys, with guns on their shoulders, were crossing a meadow towards the Pecasset woods.
