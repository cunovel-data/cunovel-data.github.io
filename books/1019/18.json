{"id":23041,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. LYMAN\u0027S DISAPPOINTMENT.","content":"James was not without his share of curiosity, and he was strongly desirous of seeing with his own eyes the pot of gold, and so learning how rich the hermit was. \\n\\n \\n\\n Prejudiced as he was against Mark, he did not really believe the boy would appropriate money that did not belong to him, though it would have been a satisfaction to him to find that his enemy was in a scrape. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That boy, Mark, seems to be an artful young rascal,\" Lyman Taylor remarked, as they were walking along together. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is all of that,\" said James, emphatically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My uncle is old, and his mind is weak. He is very likely to be influenced by a sharp, unprincipled boy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s lucky you came down here to watch him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That depends on whether I am able to put a spoke in his wheel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know whether your uncle has much money?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, positively, but I have heard he was very successful in California.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If he is rich, I shouldn\u0027t think he would live in such a tumble-down cabin,\" said Tom. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps he has become a miser. His burying money looks like it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They entered the wood, and as the boys knew their way all over it, they were able to go straight to the tree. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was from this tree that old Anthony measured,\" said James. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can you tell in what direction?\" inquired Lyman, anxiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This way, I am sure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know how far?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not exactly, but we can tell by seeing where the ground has been disturbed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lyman Taylor took the spade and began to dig vigorously. Such hard work was not generally to his taste, but now he was spurred by a powerful motive. \\n\\n \\n\\n He would not have been sorry, now that he had obtained the information he required, if the boys had left him to work alone. But this they had no intention of doing. They were very curious to see the treasure unearthed, and ascertain how much there was. \\n\\n \\n\\n At length, the spade struck the earthen pot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve touched it!\" exclaimed Lyman, triumphantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n He worked with redoubled energy, and soon laid bare the buried vessel. \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys drew near, eagerly, and looked into the hole. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lyman threw himself down upon his knees, and removed the cover of the jar. No sooner had he done so, when he uttered a fierce cry of disappointment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Boys,\" he said, looking up with haggard face, \"there\u0027s nothing there!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No gold in the jar?\" asked James, with a blank look. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a particle. Are you sure there was any left?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We couldn\u0027t see, but it stands to reason that it would not have been so carefully covered up unless there had been some left.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are right there. Now, what has become of it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can Mark have taken it?\" said James, turning to Tom. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" answered Tom, doubtfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s just what happened. I\u0027d like to wring the young rascal\u0027s neck,\" said Lyman, fiercely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you going to do about it?\" asked James, curiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say, boys, it\u0027s pretty hard luck,\" complained Lyman, \"to see yourself robbed by an artful young scoundrel. He\u0027s just taken in Uncle Anthony by his artful ways, and is laying a trap for his money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see now,\" said James, quickly. \"That\u0027s what he meant by not caring about losing his place in my father\u0027s shop.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go and warn my uncle against him,\" said Lyman. \"Boys, will you show me the shortest way to the cabin?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly, with pleasure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pleased with the idea of getting Mark into a scrape, James guided the disappointed nephew to the hermit\u0027s dwelling. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1828/53040.html","bookId":1019,"book":{"id":1019,"title":"Mark Manning\u0027s Mission","description":"简介： Two boys, with guns on their shoulders, were crossing a meadow towards the Pecasset woods.
