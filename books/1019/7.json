{"id":23030,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII. MARK AT HOME.","content":"Mark\u0027s home was a small cottage of a story and a half, surmounted by a sloping roof. It was plainly furnished, but looked comfortable. His mother was a pleasant looking woman of middle age, who managed well their scanty income, consisting chiefly of Mark\u0027s earnings. \"Are you not later than usual, Mark?\" she inquired. \"Yes, mother; I went out gunning, and did an errand for old Anthony, who is laid up with the rheumatism in his cabin.\" \"Poor man! I hope he won\u0027t suffer.\" \"Thanks to me, he probably will not.\" \"What can you do for him, Mark? You have no money to spare.\" \"Haven\u0027t I, mother?\" asked Mark, with a smile, as he drew from his pocket a large handful of silver and gold. \"What do you say to that?\" \"Oh, Mark! I hope you came honestly by that money,\" said the widow, nervously. \"I haven\u0027t been robbing a bank, if that\u0027s what you mean, mother. I couldn\u0027t very well, as there is none within ten miles.\" \"Then, Mark, where did the money come from?\" \"It belongs to old Anthony. He asked me to take charge of it, as I shall need to be buying things for him in the village for a few days to come.\" \"For mercy\u0027s sake, be careful of it, Mark, as, if you lost it, we couldn\u0027t make up the loss.\" \"I\u0027ll look after that. In fact, I think it will be safer with me than with the owner. If any dishonest person should enter his cabin, he could not help being robbed in his present condition.\" \"That would be very unfortunate, as the old man is probably very poor.\" Mark was about to undeceive his mother, but, reflecting that Lyman Taylor might still be in the village, he thought it not prudent to betray the hermit\u0027s secret. \"I heard a report to-day, Mark,\" said his mother, as she was setting the supper table, \"that the shoe-shop was to be closed for a month.\" \"I hope not,\" said Mark, startled. \"That would be serious for us.\" \"And for others too, Mark.\" \"Yes. It isn\u0027t as if there were other employments open, but there is absolutely nothing, unless I could get a chance to do some farm work.\" \"Perhaps Deacon Miller may need a boy.\" \"He\u0027s about the last man I would work for. He wouldn\u0027t pay me a cent.\" \"Why not, Mark? He wouldn\u0027t expect you to work for nothing.\" \"He claims that I owe him forty-five dollars, and would expect me to work it out.\" \"What do you mean, Mark? How can you owe the deacon forty-five dollars?\" \"I don\u0027t, but he claims I do.\" Mark then told his mother the story of the cow. \"Deacon Miller expects me to pay for it,\" he concluded, \"but I think he\u0027ll have to take it out in expecting.\" \"Oh, Mark, I am afraid this will lead to serious trouble,\" said Mrs. Manning, looking distressed. \"He may go to law about it.\" \"He can\u0027t make me pay for the damage somebody else did, mother.\" \"But if he makes out that you shot the cow?\" \"I won\u0027t trouble about it. It might spoil my appetite for supper. I\u0027ve got a healthy appetite to-night, mother.\" \"Your story has taken away mine, Mark.\" \"Don\u0027t worry, mother; it will all come right.\" \"I am afraid worrying comes natural to me, Mark. I\u0027ve seen more trouble than you have, my son.\" \"Forget it all till supper is over, mother.\" Supper was scarcely over when a knock was heard at the door, and John Downie entered. He was a boy of Scotch descent, and lived near by. \"How are you, Johnny,\" said Mark, \"won\u0027t you have some supper?\" \"Thank you, Mark, I\u0027ve had some. Have you heard about Deacon Miller\u0027s cow?\" \"What about her?\" asked Mark, eagerly. \"You know old Whitey?\" \"Yes, yes.\" \"Her eyes are put out by an accidental discharge of a gun, and I guess she will have to be killed.\" \"Do you know who shot her?\" asked Mark, with intense interest. \"Yes, I do, but the deacon doesn\u0027t,\" answered John. \"Who was it?\" \"James Collins. He and Tom Wyman were coming through the pasture, when James, in handling his gun awkwardly, managed to discharge it full in poor Whitey\u0027s face.\" \"How do you know it was James?\" \"Because I saw it. I was in the next field and saw it all.\" \"Did the boys see you?\" \"No; they hurried away as fast as they could go.\" \"Johnny, you\u0027re a trump!\" exclaimed Mark, rising and shaking the boy\u0027s hand vigorously. \"Why am I a trump?\" asked Johnny, astonished. \"Because your testimony will clear me. The deacon charges me with shooting the cow, and wants me to pay forty-five dollars.\" \"Gosh!\" exclaimed Johnny. \"But what makes him think you shot old Whitey?\" Mark briefly explained. \"But,\" said Mrs. Manning, \"surely James Collins would not permit you to suffer for his fault?\" \"You don\u0027t know James, mother. That\u0027s just what he would do, I feel sure. What do you say, Johnny?\" \"Jim Collins is just mean enough to do it,\" answered John. \"He can\u0027t do it now, however. Mr. Collins is abundantly able to pay for the cow, and I guess he\u0027ll have to.\" \"I don\u0027t know how we could ever have paid so large a sum,\" said the widow. \"We shan\u0027t have to, mother, that\u0027s one comfort.\" \"There\u0027s the deacon coming!\" exclaimed Johnny, suddenly. \"So he is! Johnny, just run into the kitchen, and I\u0027ll call you when you\u0027re wanted. We\u0027ll have some fun. Mother, don\u0027t say a word till we hear what the deacon has to say.\" By this time the deacon had knocked. Mrs. Manning admitted him, and he entered with a preliminary cough. \"Are your family well, deacon?\" asked the mother. \"They\u0027re middlin\u0027, widder, which is a comfort. Families are often a source of trouble,\" and here the deacon glanced sharply at Mark, who, rather to his surprise, looked cool and composed. \"That may be, Deacon Miller, but I am thankful that Mark never gives me any trouble.\" \"Don\u0027t be too sure of that, ma\u0027am,\" said the deacon, grimly. \"It\u0027s about that very thing I\u0027ve come here now. Your son has shot my most valuable cow, old Whitey, and I regret to say, widder, that he\u0027ll have to make it good for me. Forty-five dollars is what the critter is worth, and I wouldn\u0027t have taken that for her.\" \"Are you sure Mark shot your cow?\" asked Mrs. Manning. \"As sure as I need to be. I caught him standin\u0027 by the cow with his gun in his hand. The barrel was empty, for I tried it to see.\" \"What have you to say to this charge, Mark?\" \"That Deacon Miller is mistaken. I did not shoot his cow.\" \"I reckon you\u0027ll have to pay for it all the same. Mark Manning. I don\u0027t want to be hard on a poor widder, but it stands to reason that I should be paid for my cow.\" \"I agree to that,\" said Mark, \"but I\u0027m not the one.\" \"Mebbe the cow shot herself!\" said the deacon, sarcastically. \"It may be nat\u0027ral for cows to commit suicide, but I never saw one do it as far as I can remember. Young man, your story is too thin.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1828/53029.html","bookId":1019,"book":{"id":1019,"title":"Mark Manning\u0027s Mission","description":"简介： Two boys, with guns on their shoulders, were crossing a meadow towards the Pecasset woods.
