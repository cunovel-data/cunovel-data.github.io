Trevize had gathered up hisfutile weapons, had opened the airlock, and they had tumbled in. Trevizedidn\u0027t notice until they were off the surface that Fallom had beenbrought in as well. \\n\\n They probably would not have made it in time if the Solarian useof airflight had not been so comparatively unsophisticated. It tookthe approaching Solarian vessel an unconscionable time to descend andland. On the other hand, it took virtually no time for the computer ofthe Far Star to take the gravitic ship vertically upward. \\n\\n And although the cut-off of the gravitational interaction and,therefore, of inertia wiped out the otherwise unbearable effects ofacceleration that would have accompanied so speedy a takeoff, it didnot wipe out the effects of air resistance. The outer hull temperaturerose at a distinctly more rapid rate than navy regulations (or shipspecifications, for that matter) would have considered suitable. \\n\\n As they rose, they could see the second Solarian ship land andseveral more approaching. Trevize wondered how many robots Bliss couldhave handled, and decided they would have been overwhelmed if they hadremained on the surface fifteen minutes longer. \\n\\n Once out in space (or space enough, with only tenuous wisps of theplanetary exosphere around them), Trevize made for the nightside of theplanet. It was a hop away, since they had left the surface as sunsetwas approaching. In the dark, the Far Star would have a chanceto cool more rapidly, and there the ship could continue to recede fromthe surface in a slow spiral. \\n\\n Pelorat came out of the room he shared with Bliss. He said, \"Thechild is sleeping normally now. We\u0027ve showed it how to use the toiletand it had no trouble understanding.\"\"That\u0027s not surprising. It must have had similar facilities in themansion.\"\"I didn\u0027t see any there and I was looking,\" said Pelorat feelingly. \"Wedidn\u0027t get back on the ship a moment too soon for me.\"\"Or any of us. But why did we bring that child on board?\"Pelorat shrugged apologetically. \"Bliss wouldn\u0027t let go. It was likesaving a life in return for the one she took. She can\u0027t bear \"\"I know,\" said Trevize. \\n\\n Pelorat said, \"It\u0027s a very oddly shaped child.\"\"Being hermaphroditic, it would have to be,\" said Trevize. \\n\\n \"It has testicles, you know.\"\"It could scarcely do without them.\"\"And what I can only describe as a very small vagina.\"Trevize made a face. \"Disgusting.\"\"Not really, Golan,\" said Pelorat, protesting. \"It\u0027s adapted to itsneeds. It only delivers a fertilized egg-cell, or a very tiny embryo,which is then developed under laboratory conditions, tended, I dare say,by robots.\"\"And what happens if their robot-system breaks down? If that happens,they would no longer be able to produce viable young.\"\"Any world would be in serious trouble if its social structure brokedown completely.\"\"Not that I would weep uncontrollably over the Solarians.\"\"Well,\" said Pelorat, \"I admit it doesn\u0027t seem a very attractiveworld to us, I mean. But that\u0027s only the people and the socialstructure, which are not our type at all, dear chap. But subtract thepeople and the robots, and you have a world which otherwise \"\"Might fall apart as Aurora is beginning to do,\" said Trevize. \"How\u0027sBliss, Janov?\"\"Worn out, I\u0027m afraid. She\u0027s sleeping now. She had a very bad time, Golan.\"\"I didn\u0027t exactly enjoy myself either.\"Trevize closed his eyes, and decided he could use some sleep himselfand would indulge in that relief as soon as he was reasonably certainthe Solarians had no space capability and so far the computer hadreported nothing of artifactitious nature in space. \\n\\n He thought bitterly of the two Spacer planets they hadvisited hostile wild dogs on one hostile hermaphroditicloners on the other and in neither place the tiniest hint as tothe location of Earth. All they had to show for the double visit wasFallom. \\n\\n He opened his eyes. Pelorat was still sitting in place at the otherside of the computer, watching him solemnly. \\n\\n Trevize said, with sudden conviction, \"We should have left thatSolarian child behind.\"Pelorat said, \"The poor thing. They would have killed it.\"\"Even so,\" said Trevize, \"it belonged there. It\u0027s part of thatsociety. Being put to death because of being superfluous is the sort ofthing it\u0027s born to.\"\"Oh, my dear fellow, that\u0027s a hardhearted way to look at it.\"\"It\u0027s a rational way. We don\u0027t know how to care for it,and it may suffer more lingeringly with us and die anyway. What doesit eat?\"\"Whatever we do, I suppose, old man. Actually, the problem is whatdo we eat? How much do we have in the way of supplies?\"\"Plenty. Plenty. Even allowing for our new passenger.\"Pelorat didn\u0027t look overwhelmed with happiness at this remark. He said,\"It\u0027s become a pretty monotonous diet. We should have taken some itemson board on Comporellon not that their cooking was excellent.\"\"We couldn\u0027t. We left, if you remember, rather hurriedly, as we leftAurora, and as we left, in particular, Solaria. But what\u0027s a littlemonotony? It spoils one\u0027s pleasure, but it keeps one alive.\"\"Would it be possible to pick up fresh supplies if we need to?\"\"Anytime, Janov. With a gravitic ship and hyperspatial engines, theGalaxy is a small place. In days, we can be anywhere. It\u0027s just thathalf the worlds in the Galaxy are alerted to watch for our ship and Iwould rather stay out of the way for a time.\"\"I suppose that\u0027s so. Bander didn\u0027t seem interested in theship.\"\"It probably wasn\u0027t even consciously aware of it. I suspect thatthe Solarians long ago gave up space flight. Their prime desire is tobe left completely alone and they can scarcely enjoy the security ofisolation if they are forever moving about in space and advertisingtheir presence.\"\"What are we going to do next, Golan?\"Trevize said, \"We have a third world to visit.\"Pelorat shook his head. \"Judging from the first two, I don\u0027t expectmuch from that .\"\"Nor do I at the moment, but just as soon as I get a little sleep,I\u0027m going to get the computer to plot our course to that third world.\"57Trevize slept considerably longer than he had expectedto, but that scarcely mattered. There was neither day nor night, inany natural sense, on board ship, and the circadian rhythm neverworked absolutely perfectly. The hours were what they were made to be,and it wasn\u0027t uncommon for Trevize and Pelorat (and particularly Bliss)to be somewhat out-of-sync as far as the natural rhythms of eating andsleeping were concerned. \\n\\n Trevize even speculated, in the course of his scrapedown (theimportance of conserving water made it advisable to scrape off the sudsrather than rinse them off), about sleeping another hour or two, whenhe turned and found himself staring at Fallom, who was as undressed ashe was. \\n\\n He could not help jumping back, which, in the restricted area of thePersonal, was bound to bring part of his body against something hard. Hegrunted Fallom was staring curiously at him and was pointing at Trevize\u0027spenis. What it said was incomprehensible but the whole bearing of thechild seemed to bespeak a sense of disbelief. For his own peace of mind,Trevize had no choice but to put his hands over his penis. \\n\\n Then Fallom said, in its high-pitched voice, \"Greetings.\"Trevize started slightly at the child\u0027s unexpected use of Galactic,but the word had the sound of having been memorized. \\n\\n Fallom continued, a painstaking word at a time,\"Bliss say you wash me. \\n\\n \"Yes?\" said Trevize. He put his hands on Fallom\u0027sshoulders. \"You stay here.\"He pointed downward at the floor and Fallom, of course, lookedinstantly at the place to which the finger pointed. It showed nocomprehension of the phrase at all. \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t move,\" said Trevize, holding the child tightly by both arms,pressing them toward the body as though to symbolize immobility. Hehastily dried himself and put on his shorts, and over them histrousers. \\n\\n He stepped out and roared, \"Bliss!\"It was difficult for anyone to be more than four meters from any oneelse on the ship and Bliss came to the door of her room at once. Shesaid, smiling, \"Are you calling me, Trevize; or was that the soft breezesighing through the waving grass?\"\"Let\u0027s not be funny, Bliss. What is that?\" He jerked his thumb overhis shoulder. \\n\\n Bliss looked past him and said, \"Well, it looks like the young Solarianwe brought on board yesterday.\"\" You brought on board. Why do you want me to wash it?\"\"I should think you\u0027d want to. It\u0027s a very bright creature. It\u0027spicking up Galactic words quickly. It never forgets once I explainsomething. Of course, I\u0027m helping it do so.\"\"Naturally.\"\"Yes. I keep it calm. I kept it in a daze during most of the disturbingevents on the planet. I saw to it that it slept on board ship and I\u0027mtrying to divert its mind just a little bit from its lost robot, Jemby,that, apparently, it loved very much.\"\"So that it ends up liking it here, I suppose.\"\"I hope so. It\u0027s adaptable because it\u0027s young, and I encourage thatby as much as I dare influence its mind. I\u0027m going to teach it to speakGalactic.\"\"Then you wash it. Understood?\"Bliss shrugged. \"I will, if you insist, but I would want it to feelfriendly with each of us. It would be useful to have each of us performfunctions. Surely you can co-operate in that.\"\"Not to this extent. And when you finish washing it, get rid of it. Iwant to talk to you.\"Bliss said, with a sudden edge of hostility, \"How do you mean, getrid of it?\"\"I don\u0027t mean dump it through the airlock. I mean, put it in yourroom. Sit it down in a corner. I want to talk at you.\"\"I\u0027ll be at your service,\" she said coldly. \\n\\n He stared after her, nursing his wrath for the moment, then movedinto the pilot-room, and activated the viewscreen. \\n\\n Solaria was a dark circle with a curving crescent of light at theleft. Trevize placed his hands on the desk to make contact with thecomputer and found his anger cooling at once. One had to be calm to linkmind and computer effectively and, eventually, conditioned reflex linkedhandhold and serenity. \\n\\n There were no artifactitious objects about the ship in any direction,out as far as the planet itself. The Solarians (or their robots, mostlikely) could not, or would not, follow. \\n\\n Good enough. He might as well get out of the night-shadow, then. Ifhe continued to recede, it would, in any case, vanish as Solaria\u0027s discgrew smaller than that of the more distant, but much larger, sun thatit circled. \\n\\n He set the computer to move the ship out of the planetary planeas well, since that would make it possible to accelerate with greatersafety. They would then more quickly reach a region where space curvaturewould be low enough to make the Jump secure. \\n\\n And, as often on such occasions, he fell to studying the stars. Theywere almost hypnotic in their quiet changelessness. All their turbulenceand instability were wiped out by the distance that left them only dotsof light. \\n\\n One of those dots might well be the sun about which Earthrevolved the original sun, under whose radiation life began,and under whose beneficence humanity evolved. \\n\\n Surely, if the Spacer worlds circled stars that were bright andprominent members of the stellar family, and that were neverthelessunlisted in the computer\u0027s Galactic map, the same might be true ofthe sun. \\n\\n Or was it only the suns of the Spacer worlds that were omitted becauseof some primeval treaty agreement that left them to themselves? WouldEarth\u0027s sun be included in the Galactic map, but not marked off fromthe myriads of stars that were sun-like, yet had no habitable planet inorbit about itself? \\n\\n There were after all, some thirty billion sun-like stars in the Galaxy,and only about one in a thousand had habitable planets in orbits aboutthem. There might be a thousand such habitable planets within a fewhundred parsecs of his present position. Should he sift through thesun-like stars one by one, searching for them? \\n\\n Or was the original sun not even in this region of the Galaxy? Howmany other regions were convinced the sun was one of their neighbors,that they were primeval Settlers ? \\n\\n He needed information, and so far he had none. \\n\\n He doubted strongly whether even the closest examination of themillennial ruins on Aurora would give information concerning Earth\u0027slocation. He doubted even more strongly that the Solarians could be madeto yield information. \\n\\n Then, too, if all information about Earth had vanished out of thegreat Library at Trantor; if no information about Earth remained in thegreat Collective Memory of Gaia; there seemed little chance that anyinformation that might have existed on the lost worlds of the Spacerswould have been overlooked. \\n\\n And if he found Earth\u0027s sun and, then, Earth itself, by the sheerestgood fortune would something force him to be unaware of thefact? Was Earth\u0027s defense absolute? Was its determination to remain inhiding unbreakable? \\n\\n What was he looking for anyway? \\n\\n Was it Earth? Or was it the flaw in Seldon\u0027s Plan that he thought(for no clear reason) he might find on Earth? \\n\\n Seldon\u0027s Plan had been working for five centuries now, and wouldbring the human species (so it was said) to safe harbor at last inthe womb of a Second Galactic Empire, greater than the First, a noblerand a freer one and yet he, Trevize, had voted against it, andfor Galaxia. \\n\\n Galaxia would be one large organism, while the Second GalacticEmpire would, however great in size and variety, be a mere union ofindividual organisms of microscopic size in comparison with itself. TheSecond Galactic Empire would be another example of the kind of union ofindividuals that humanity had set up ever since it became humanity. TheSecond Galactic Empire might be the largest and best of the species,but it would still be but one more member of that species. \\n\\n For Galaxia, a member of an entirely different species of organization,to be better than the Second Galactic Empire, there must be a flaw inthe Plan, something the great Hari Seldon had himself overlooked. \\n\\n But if it were something Seldon had overlooked, how could Trevizecorrect the matter? He was not a mathematician; knew nothing, absolutelynothing, about the details of the Plan; would understand nothing,furthermore, even if it were explained to him. \\n\\n All he knew were the assumptions that a great number ofhuman beings be involved and that they not be aware of the conclusionsreached. The first assumption was self-evidently true, considering thevast population of the Galaxy, and the second had to be true since onlythe Second Foundationers knew the details of the Plan, and they kept itto themselves securely enough. \\n\\n That left an added unacknowledged assumption, a taken-for-grantedassumption, one so taken for granted it was never mentioned nor thoughtof and yet one that might be false. An assumption that, if itwere false, would alter the grand conclusion of the Planand make Galaxia preferable to Empire. \\n\\n But if the assumption was so obvious and so taken for granted thatit was never even expressed, how could it be false? And if no one evermentioned it, or thought of it, how could Trevize know it was there,or have any idea of its nature even if he guessed its existence? \\n\\n Was he truly Trevize, the man with the flawless intuition asGaia insisted? Did he know the right thing to do even when he didn\u0027tknow why he was doing it? \\n\\n Now he was visiting every Spacer world he knew about. Was thatthe right thing to do? Did the Spacer worlds hold the answer? Or atleast the beginning of the answer? \\n\\n What was there on Aurora but ruins and wild dogs? (And, presumably,other feral creatures. Raging bulls? Overgrown rats? Stalking green-eyedcats?) Solaria was alive, but what was there on it but robots andenergy-transducing human beings? What had either world to do with Seldon\u0027sPlan unless they contained the secret of the location of the Earth? \\n\\n And if they did, what had Earth to do with Seldon\u0027sPlan? Was this all madness? Had he listened too long and too seriouslyto the fantasy of his own infallibility? \\n\\n An overwhelming weight of shame came over him and seemed to pressupon him to the point where he could barely breathe. He looked at thestars remote, uncaring and thought: I must be the Great Foolof the Galaxy. \\n\\n 58Bliss\u0027s voice broke in on him. \"Well, Trevize, why doyou want to see Is anything wrong?\" Her voice had twisted intosudden concern. \\n\\n Trevize looked up and, for a moment, found it momentarily difficultto brush away his mood. He stared at her, then said, \"No, no. Nothing\u0027swrong. I I was merely lost in thought. Every once in a while,after all, I find myself thinking.\"He was uneasily aware that Bliss could read his emotions. He hadonly her word that she was voluntarily abstaining from any oversight ofhis mind. \\n\\n She seemed to accept his statement, however. She said, \"Pelorat is withFallom, teaching it Galactic phrases. The child seems to eat what we dowithout undue objection. But what do you want to see me about?\"\"Well, not here,\", said Trevize. \"The computer doesn\u0027t need me atthe moment. If you want to come into my room, the bed\u0027s made and youcan sit on it while I sit on the chair. Or vice versa, if you prefer.\"\"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" They walked the short distance to Trevize\u0027sroom. She eyed him narrowly. \"You don\u0027t seem furious anymore.\"\"Checking my mind?\"\"Not at all. Checking your face.\"\"I\u0027m not furious. I may lose my temper momentarily, now and then,but that\u0027s not the same as furious. If you don\u0027t mind, though, thereare questions I must ask you.\"Bliss sat down on Trevize\u0027s bed, holding herself erect, and witha solemn expression on her wide-cheeked face and in her dark browneyes. Her shoulder-length black hair was neatly arranged and her slimhands were clasped loosely in her lap. There was a faint trace of perfumeabout her. \\n\\n Trevize smiled. \"You\u0027ve dolled yourself up. I suspect you think Iwon\u0027t yell quite so hard at a young and pretty girl.\"\"You can yell and scream all you wish if it will make you feelbetter. I just don\u0027t want you yelling and screaming at Fallom.\"\"I don\u0027t intend to. In fact, I don\u0027t intend to yell and scream atyou. Haven\u0027t we decided to be friends?\"\"Gaia has never had anything but feelings of friendship toward you,Trevize.\"\"I\u0027m not talking about Gaia. I know you\u0027re part of Gaia and that youare Gaia. Still there\u0027s part of you that\u0027s an individual, at least aftera fashion. I\u0027m talking to the individual. I\u0027m talking to someone namedBliss without regard or with as little regard as possible toGaia. Haven\u0027t we decided to be friends, Bliss?\"\"Yes, Trevize.\"\"Then how is it you delayed dealing with the robots on Solaria afterwe had left the mansion and reached the ship? I was humiliated andphysically hurt, yet you did nothing. Even though every moment mightbring additional robots to the scene and the number might overwhelm us,you did nothing.\"Bliss looked at him seriously, and spoke as though she were intenton explaining her actions rather than defending them. \"I was not doingnothing, Trevize. I was studying the Guardian Robots\u0027 minds, and tryingto learn how to handle them.\"\"I know that\u0027s what you were doing. At least you said you were at thetime. I just don\u0027t see the sense of it. Why handle the minds when youwere perfectly capable of destroying them as you finally did?\"\"Do you think it so easy to destroy an intelligent being?\"Trevize\u0027s lips twisted into an expression of distaste. \"Come, Bliss. Anintelligent being ? It was just a robot.\"\"Just a robot?\" A little passion entered her voice. \"That\u0027s theargument always. Just. Just! Why should the Solarian, Bander, havehesitated to kill us? We were just human beings without transducers. Whyshould there be any hesitation about leaving Fallom to its fate? Itwas just a Solarian, and an immature specimen at that. If you startdismissing anyone or anything you want to do away with as just a thisor just a that, you can destroy anything you wish. There are alwayscategories you can find for them.\"Trevize said, \"Don\u0027t carry a perfectly legitimate remark to extremesjust to make it seem ridiculous. The robot was just a robot. You can\u0027tdeny that. It was not human. It was not intelligent in our sense. Itwas a machine mimicking an appearance of intelligence.\"Bliss said, \"How easily you can talk when you know nothing about it. Iam Gaia. Yes, I am Bliss, too, but I am Gaia. I am a world that findsevery atom of itself precious and meaningful, and every organization ofatoms even more precious and meaningful. I/we/Gaia would not lightly breakdown an organization, though we would gladly build it into something stillmore complex, provided always that that would not harm the whole. \\n\\n \"The highest form of organization we know produces intelligence, and tobe willing to destroy intelligence requires the sorest need. Whether itis machine intelligence or biochemical intelligence scarcely matters. Infact, the Guardian Robot represented a kind of intelligence I/we/Gaiahad never encountered. To study it was wonderful. To destroy it,unthinkable except in a moment of crowning emergency.\"Trevize said dryly, \"There were three greater intelligences at stake: \\n\\n your own, that of Pelorat, the human being you love, and, if you don\u0027tmind my mentioning it, mine.\"\"Four! You still keep forgetting to include Fallom. They werenot yet at stake. So I judged. See here Suppose you were facedwith a painting, a great artistic masterpiece, the existence of whichmeant death to you. All you had to do was to bring a wide brush of paintslam-bang, and at random, across the face of that painting and it wouldbe destroyed forever, and you would be safe. But suppose, instead, thatif you studied the painting carefully, and added just a touch of painthere, a speck there, scraped off a minute portion in a third place, andso on, you would alter the painting enough to avoid death, and yet leaveit a masterpiece. Naturally, the revision couldn\u0027t be done except withthe most painstaking care. It would take time, but surely, if that timeexisted, you would try to save the painting as well as your life.\"Trevize said, \"Perhaps. But in the end you destroyed the painting pastredemption. The wide paintbrush came down and wiped out all thewonderful little touches of color and subtleties of form and shape. Andyou did that instantly when a little hermaphrodite was at risk, whereour danger and your own had not moved you.\"\"We Outworlders were still not at immediate risk,while Fallom, it seemed to me, suddenly was. I had to choose betweenthe Guardian Robots and Fallom, and, with no time to lose, I had tochoose Fallom.\"\"Is that what it was, Bliss? A quick calculation weighing one mindagainst another, a quick judging of the greater complexity and thegreater worth?\"\"Yes.\"Trevize said, \"Suppose I tell you, it was just a child that wasstanding before you, a child threatened with death. An instinctivematernalism gripped you then, and you saved it where earlier you wereall calculation when only three adult lives were at stake.\"Bliss reddened slightly. \"There might have been something like thatin it; but it was not after the fashion of the mocking way in which yousay it. It had rational thought behind it, too.\"\"I wonder. If there had been rational thought behind it, you mighthave considered that the child was meeting the common fate inevitablein its own society. Who knows how many thousands of children had beencut down to maintain the low number these Solarians think suitable totheir world?\"\"There\u0027s more to it than that, Trevize. The child would be killedbecause it was too young to be a Successor, and that was because it hada parent who had died prematurely, and that was because Ihad killed that parent.\"\"At a time when it was kill or be killed.\"\"Not important. I killed the parent. I could not stand by and allowthe child to be killed for my deed. Besides, it offers for studya brain of a kind that has never been studied by Gaia.\"\"A child\u0027s brain.\"\"It will not remain a child\u0027s brain. It will further develop thetwo transducer-lobes on either side of the brain. Those lobes give aSolarian abilities that all of Gaia cannot match. Simply to keep a fewlights lit, just to activate a device to open a door, wore me out. Bandercould have kept all the power going over an estate as great in complexityand greater in size than that city we saw on Comporellon and doit even while sleeping.\"Trevize said, \"Then you see the child as an important bit offundamental brain research.\"\"In a way, yes.\"\"That\u0027s not the way I feel. To me, it seems we have taken dangeraboard. Great danger.\"\"Danger in what way? It will adapt perfectly with my help. Itis highly intelligent, and already shows signs of feeling affection forus. It will eat what we eat, go where we go, and I/we/Gaia will gaininvaluable knowledge concerning its brain.\"\"What if it produces young? It doesn\u0027t need a mate. It is its ownmate.\"\"It won\u0027t be of child-bearing age for many years. The Spacerslived for centuries and the Solarians had no desire to increase theirnumbers. Delayed reproduction is probably bred into the population. Fallomwill have no children for a long time.\"\"How do you know this?\"\"I don\u0027t know it. I\u0027m merely being logical.\"\"And I tell you Fallom will prove dangerous.\"\"You don\u0027t know that. And you\u0027re not being logical, either.\"\"I feel it Bliss, without reason. At the moment. And it is you,not I, who insists my intuition is infallible.\"And Bliss frowned and looked uneasy. \\n\\n 59Pelorat paused at the door to the pilot-room and lookedinside in a rather ill-at-ease manner. It was as though he were tryingto decide whether Trevize was hard at work or not. \\n\\n Trevize had his hands on the table, as he always did when he madehimself part of the computer, and his eyes were on the viewscreen. Peloratjudged, therefore, he was at work, and he waited patiently, trying notto move or, in any way, disturb the other. \\n\\n Eventually, Trevize looked up at Pelorat. It was not a matter oftotal awareness. Trevize\u0027s eyes always seemed a bit glazed and unfocusedwhen he was in computer-communion, as though he were looking, thinking,living in some other way than a person usually did. \\n\\n But he nodded slowly at Pelorat, as though the sight, penetratingwith difficulty, did, at last, sluggishly impress itself on the opticlobes. Then, after a while, he lifted his hands and smiled and washimself again. \\n\\n Pelorat said apologetically, \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m getting in your way,Golan.\"\"Not seriously, Janov. I was just testing to see if we were ready forthe Jump. We are, just about, but I think I\u0027ll give it a few more hours,just for luck.\"\"Does luck or random factors have anything to do withit?\"\"An expression only,\" said Trevize, smiling, \"but random factors dohave something to do with it, in theory. What\u0027s on your mind?\"\"May I sit down?\"\"Surely, but let\u0027s go into my room. How\u0027s Bliss?\"\"Very well.\" He cleared his throat. \"She\u0027s sleeping again. She musthave her sleep, you understand.\"\"I understand perfectly. It\u0027s the hyperspatial separation.\"\"Exactly, old chap.\"\"And Fallom?\" Trevize reclined on the bed, leaving Pelorat thechair. \\n\\n \"Those books out of my library that you had your computerprint up for me? The folk tales? It\u0027s reading them. Of course, itunderstands very little Galactic, but it seems to enjoy sounding outthe words. He\u0027s I keep wanting to use the masculine pronoun forit. Why do you suppose that is, old fellow?\"Trevize shrugged. \"Perhaps because you\u0027re masculine yourself.\"\"Perhaps. It\u0027s fearfully intelligent, you know.\"\"I\u0027m sure.\"Pelorat hesitated. \"I gather you\u0027re not very fond of Fallom.\"\"Nothing against it personally, Janov. I\u0027ve never had children andI\u0027ve never been particularly fond of them generally. You\u0027ve had children,I seem to remember.\"\"One son. It was a pleasure, I recall, having my son when he wasa little boy. Maybe that\u0027s why I want to use the masculinepronoun for Fallom. It takes me back a quarter of a century or so.\"\"I\u0027ve no objection to your liking it, Janov.\"\"You\u0027d like him, too, if you gave yourself a chance.\"\"I\u0027m sure I would, Janov, and maybe someday I will give myself achance to do so.\"Pelorat hesitated again. \"I also know that you must get tired ofarguing with Bliss.\"\"Actually, I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll be arguing much, Janov. She and I areactually getting along quite well. We even had a reasonable discussionjust the other day no shouting, no recrimination abouther delay in inactivating the Guardian Robots. She keeps saving ourlives, after all, so I can\u0027t very well offer her less than friendship,can I?\"\"Yes, I see that, but I don\u0027t mean arguing, in the sense ofquarreling. I mean this constant wrangle about Galaxia as opposed toindividuality.\"\"Oh, that! I suppose that will continue politely.\"\"Would you mind, Golan, if I took up the argument on her behalf?\"\"Perfectly all right. Do you accept the idea of Galaxia on your own,or is it that you simply feel happier when you agree with Bliss?\"\"Honestly, on my own. I think that Galaxia is what should beforthcoming. You yourself chose that course of action and I am constantlybecoming more convinced that that is correct.\"\"Because I chose it? That\u0027s no argument. Whatever Gaia says, I maybe wrong, you know. So don\u0027t let Bliss persuade you into Galaxia onthat basis.\"\"I don\u0027t think you are wrong. Solaria showed me that, not Bliss.\"\"How?\"\"Well, to begin with, we are Isolates, you and I.\"\" Her term, Janov. I prefer to think of us asindividuals.\"\"A matter of semantics, old chap. Call it what you will, we areenclosed in our private skins surrounding our private thoughts, and wethink first and foremost of ourselves. Self-defense is our first law ofnature, even if that means harming everyone else in existence.\"\"People have been known to give their lives for others.\"\"A rare phenomenon. Many more people have been known to sacrificethe dearest needs of others to some foolish whim of their own.\"\"And what has that to do with Solaria?\"\"Why, on Solaria, we see what Isolates or individuals, if youprefer can become. The Solarians can hardly bear to divide a wholeworld among themselves. They consider living a life of complete isolationto be perfect liberty. They have no yearning for even their own offspring,but kill them if there are too many. They surround themselves with robotslaves to which they supply the power, so that if they die, their wholehuge estate symbolically dies as well. Is this admirable, Golan? Can youcompare it in decency, kindness, and mutual concern with Gaia? Blisshas not discussed this with me at all. It is my own feeling.\"Trevize said, \"And it is like you to have that feeling, Janov. Ishare it. I think Solarian society is horrible, but it wasn\u0027t alwayslike that. They are descended from Earthmen, and, more immediately, fromSpacers who lived a much more normal life. The Solarians chose a path,for one reason or another, which led to an extreme, but you can\u0027t judgeby extremes. In all the Galaxy, with its millions of inhabited worlds,is there one you know that now, or in the past, has had a society likethat of Solaria, or even remotely like that of Solaria? And would evenSolaria have such a society if it were not riddled with robots? Is itconceivable that a society of individuals could evolve to such a pitchof Solarian horror without robots?\"Pelorat\u0027s face twitched a little. \"You punch holes in everything,Golan or at least I mean you don\u0027t ever seem to be at a loss in defendingthe type of Galaxy you voted against.\"\"I won\u0027t knock down everything. There is a rationale for Galaxiaand when I find it, I\u0027ll know it, and I\u0027ll give in. Or perhaps, moreaccurately, if I find it.\"\"Do you think you might not?\"Trevize shrugged. \"How can I say? Do you know why I\u0027m waitinga few hours to make the Jump, and why I\u0027m in danger of talking myselfinto waiting a few days?\"\"You said it would be safer if we waited.\"\"Yes, that\u0027s what I said, but we\u0027d be safe enough now. What I reallyfear is that those Spacer worlds for which we have the co-ordinateswill fail us altogether. We have only three, and we\u0027ve already used uptwo, narrowly escaping death each time. In doing so, we have still notgained any hint as to Earth\u0027s location, or even, in actual fact, Earth\u0027sexistence. Now I face the third and last chance, and what if it, too,fails us?\"Pelorat sighed. \"You know there are old folk tales one, in fact,exists among those I gave Fallom to practice upon in which someoneis allowed three wishes, but only three. Three seems to be a significantnumber in these things, perhaps because it is the first odd number sothat it is the smallest decisive number. You know, two out of threewins. The point is that in these stories, the wishes are of nouse. No one ever wishes correctly, which, I have always supposed, isancient wisdom to the effect that the satisfaction of your wants mustbe earned, and not \"He fell suddenly silent and abashed. \"I\u0027m sorry, old man, but I\u0027mwasting your time. I do tend to rattle on when I get started on myhobby.\"\"I find you always interesting, Janov. I am willing to see theanalogy. We have been given three wishes, and we have had two and theyhave done us no good. Now only one is left. Somehow, I am sure of failureagain and so I wish to postpone it. That is why I am putting off theJump as long as possible.\"\"What will you do if you do fail again? Go back to Gaia? ToTerminus?\"\"Oh no,\" said Trevize in a whisper, shaking his head. \"The searchmust continue if I only knew how.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630/48248.html","bookId":5,"book":{"id":5,"title":"基地系列 Foundation and Earth 基地与地球","description":"简介： 基地纪元498年。银河未来的命运决定于某人一念之间，这个就是葛兰崔维兹。他必须在第一基地，第二基地与盖娅之间做出银河未来由谁主导的决定：由第一基地创建的新帝国将会逞领银河进入科技昌明的世纪，却会像第一帝国那样摧毁在战争之中；由第二基地指导的新帝国将能确...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201608/24/13-41-46-87-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
