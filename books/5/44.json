{"id":158,"no":44,"title":"Chapter 21: The Search Ends","content":"101Trevize found himself in a complete state ofdisbelief. He had recovered from the odd euphoria he had felt just beforeand after the landing on the moon a euphoria, he now suspected,that had been imposed on him by this self-styled robot who now stoodbefore him. Trevize was still staring, and in his now perfectly sane and untouchedmind, he remained lost in astonishment. He had talked in astonishment,made conversation in astonishment, scarcely understood what he said orheard as he searched for something in the appearance of this apparent man,in his behavior, in his manner of speaking, that bespoke the robot. No wonder, thought Trevize, that Bliss had detected somethingthat was neither human nor robot, but, that was, in Pelorat\u0027s words,\"something new.\" Just as well, of course, for it had turned Trevize\u0027sthoughts into another and more enlightening channel but even thatwas now crowded into the back of his mind. Bliss and Fallom had wandered off to explore the grounds. It hadbeen Bliss\u0027s suggestion, but it seemed to Trevize that it came after alightning-quick glance had been exchanged between herself and Daneel. WhenFallom refused and asked to stay with the being she persisted in callingJemby, a grave word from Daneel and a lift of the finger was enough tocause her to trot off at once. Trevize and Pelorat remained. \"They are not Foundationers, sirs,\" said the robot, as though thatexplained it all. \"One is Gaia and one is a Spacer.\"Trevize remained silent while they were led to simply designed chairsunder a tree. They seated themselves, at a gesture from the robot,and when he sat down, too, in a perfectly human movement, Trevize said,\"Are you truly a robot?\"\"Truly, sir,\" said Daneel. Pelorat\u0027s face seemed to shine with joy. He said, \"There arereferences to a robot named Daneel in the old legends. Are you named inhis honor?\"\"I am that robot,\" said Daneel. \"It is not a legend.\"\"Oh no,\" said Pelorat. \"If you are that robot, you would have to bethousands of years old.\"\"Twenty thousand,\" said Daneel quietly. Pelorat seemed abashed at that, and glanced at Trevize, who said,with a touch of anger, \"If you are a robot, I order you to speaktruthfully.\"\"I do not need to be told to speak truthfully, sir. I must do so. You are faced then, sir, with three alternatives. Either I ama man who is lying to you; or I am a robot who has been programmed tobelieve that it is twenty thousand years old but, in fact, is not; orI am a robot who is twenty thousand years old. You mustdecide which alternative to accept.\"\"The matter may decide itself with continued conversation,\" saidTrevize dryly. \"For that matter, it is hard to believe that this isthe interior of the moon. Neither the light\" he looked up as hesaid that, for the light was precisely that of soft, diffuse sunlight,though no sun was in the sky, and, for that matter, no sky was clearlyvisible \"nor the gravity seems credible. This world should havea surface gravity of less than 0.2g.\"\"The normal surface gravity would be 0.16g actually, sir. It isbuilt up, however, by the same forces that give you, on your ship, thesensation of normal gravity, even when you are in free fall, or underacceleration. Other energy needs, including the light, are also metgravitically, though we use solar energy where that is convenient. Ourmaterial needs are all supplied by the moon\u0027s soil, except for the lightelements hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen which the moon doesnot possess. We obtain those by capturing an occasional comet. One suchcapture a century is more than enough to supply our needs.\"\"I take it Earth is useless as a source of supply.\"\"Unfortunately, that is so, sir. Our positronic brains are as sensitiveto radioactivity as human proteins are.\"\"You use the plural, and this mansion before us seems, large,beautiful, and elaborate at least as seen from the outside. Thereare then other beings on the moon. Humans? Robots?\"\"Yes, sir. We have a complete ecology on the moon and a vast andcomplex hollow within which that ecology exists. The intelligent beingsare all robots, however, more or less like myself. You will see none ofthem, however. As for this mansion, it is used by myself only and it isan establishment that is modeled exactly on one I used to live in twentythousand years ago.\"\"Which you remember in detail, do you?\" . \"Perfectly, sir. I was manufactured, and existed for a time howbrief a time it seems to me, now on the Spacer world of Aurora.\"\"The one with the \" Trevize paused. \"Yes, sir. The one with the dogs.\"\"You know about that?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"How do you come to be here, then, if you lived at first onAurora?\"\"Sir, it was to prevent the creation of a radioactive Earth that Icame here in the very beginnings of the settlement of the Galaxy. Therewas another robot with me, named Giskard, who could sense and adjustminds.\"\"As Bliss can?\"\"Yes, sir. We failed, in a way, and Giskard ceased to operate. Beforethe cessation, however, he made it possible for me to have his talentand left it to me to care for the Galaxy; for Earth, particularly.\"\"Why Earth, particularly?\"\"In part because of a man named Elijah Baley, an Earthman.\"Pelorat put in excitedly, \"He is the culture-hero I mentioned sometime ago, Golan.\"\"A culture-hero, sir?\"\"What Dr. Pelorat means,\" said Trevize, \"is that he is a person towhom much was attributed, and who may have been an amalgamation of manymen in actual history, or who may be an invented person altogether.\"Daneel considered for a moment, and then said, quite calmly, \"Thatis not so, sirs. Elijah Baley was a real man and he was one man. I donot know what your legends say of him, but in actual history, the Galaxymight never have been settled without him. In his honor, I did my bestto salvage what I could of Earth after it began to turn radioactive. Myfellow-robots were distributed over the Galaxy in an effort to influence aperson here a person there. At one time I maneuvered a beginning tothe recycling of Earth\u0027s soil. At another much later time, I maneuvereda beginning to the terraforming of a world circling the nearby star,now called Alpha. In neither case was I truly successful. I could neveradjust human minds entirely as I wished, for there was always the chancethat I might do harm to the various humans who were adjusted. I was bound,you see and am bound to this day by the Laws of Robotics.\"\"Yes?\"It did not necessarily take a being with Daneel\u0027s mental power todetect uncertainty in that monosyllable. \"The First Law,\" he said, \"is this, sir: `A robot may not injurea human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come toharm.\u0027 The Second Law: `A robot must obey the orders given it byhuman beings except where such orders would conflict with the FirstLaw.\u0027 The Third Law: `A robot must protect its own existence, aslong as such protection does not conflict with the First or SecondLaw.\u0027 Naturally, I give you these laws in the approximationof language. In actual fact they represent complicated mathematicalconfigurations of our positronic brain-paths.\"\"Do you find it difficult to deal with those Laws?\"\"I must, sir. The First Law is an absolute that almost forbids the useof my mental talents altogether. When dealing with the Galaxy it is notlikely that any course of action will prevent harm altogether. Always,some people, perhaps many people, will suffer so that a robot must chooseminimum harm. Yet, the complexity of possibilities is such that it takestime to make that choice and one is, even then, never certain.\"\"I see that,\" said Trevize. \"All through Galactic history,\" said Daneel, \"I tried to amelioratethe worst aspects of the strife and disaster that perpetually madeitself felt in the Galaxy. I may have succeeded, on occasion, and tosome extent, but if you know your Galactic history, you will know thatI did not succeed often, or by much.\"\"That much I know,\" said Trevize, with a wry smile. \"Just before Giskard\u0027s end, he conceived of a robotic law thatsuperseded even the first. We called it the `Zeroth Law\u0027 out of aninability to think of any other name that made sense. The Zeroth Law is: `A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanityto come to harm.\u0027 This automatically means that the First Law mustbe modified to be: `A robot may not injure a human being, or, throughinaction, allow a human being to come to harm, except where that wouldconflict with the Zeroth Law.\u0027 And similar modifications must be madein the Second and Third Laws.\"Trevize frowned. \"How do you decide what is injurious, or notinjurious, to humanity as a whole?\"\"Precisely, sir,\" said Daneel. \"In theory, the Zeroth Law was theanswer to our problems. In practice, we could never decide. A humanbeing is a concrete object. Injury to a person can be estimated andjudged. Humanity is an abstraction. How do we deal with it?\"\"I don\u0027t know,\" said Trevize. \"Wait,\" said Pelorat. \"You could convert humanity into a singleorganism. Gaia.\"\"That is what I tried to do, sir. I engineered the founding ofGaia. If humanity could be made a single organism, it would becomea concrete object, and it could be dealt with. It was, however, notas easy to create a superorganism as I had hoped. In the first place,it could not be done unless human beings valued the superorganism morethan their individuality, and I had to find a mind-cast that would allowthat. It was a long time before I thought of the Laws of Robotics.\"\"Ah, then, the Gaians are robots. I had suspected thatfrom the start.\"\"In that case, you suspected incorrectly, sir. They are humanbeings, but they have brains firmly inculcated with the equivalentof the Laws of Robotics. They have to value life, really value it. And even after that was done, there remained a seriousflaw. A superorganism consisting of human beings only is unstable. Itcannot be set up. Other animals must be added then plants thenthe inorganic world. The smallest superorganism that is truly stable isan entire world, and a world large enough and complex enough to have astable ecology. It took a long time to understand this, and it is only inthis last century that Gaia was fully established and thatit became ready to move on toward Galaxia and, even so, that willtake a long time, too. Perhaps not as long as the road already traveled,however, since we now know the rules.\"\"But you needed me to make the decision for you. Is that it,Daneel?\"\"Yes, sir. The Laws of Robotics would not allow me, nor Gaia, to makethe decision and chance harm to humanity. And meanwhile, five centuriesago, when it seemed that I would never work out methods for gettinground all the difficulties that stood in the way of establishing Gaia,I turned to the second-best and helped bring about the development ofthe science of psychohistory.\"\"I might have guessed that,\" mumbled Trevize. \"You know, Daneel, I\u0027mbeginning to believe you are twenty thousand years old.\"\"Thank you, sir.\"Pelorat said, \"Wait a while. I think I see something. Are you partof Gaia yourself, Daneel? Would that be how you knew about the dogs onAurora? Through Bliss?\"Daneel said, \"In a way, sir, you are correct. I am associated withGaia, though I am not part of it.\"Trevize\u0027s eyebrows went up. \"That sounds like Comporellon, the worldwe visited immediately after leaving Gaia. It insists it is not part ofthe Foundation Confederation, but is only associated with it.\"Slowly, Daneel nodded. \"I suppose that analogy is apt, sir. Ican, as an associate of Gaia, make myself aware of what Gaia is awareof in the person of the woman, Bliss, for instance. Gaia, however,cannot make itself aware of what I am aware of, so that I maintain myfreedom of action. That freedom of action is necessary until Galaxia iswell established.\"Trevize looked steadily at the robot for a moment, then said, \"Anddid you use your awareness through Bliss in order to interfere withevents on our journey to mold them to your better liking?\"Daneel sighed in a curiously human fashion. \"I could not do much,sir. The Laws of Robotics always hold me back. And yet, I lightenedthe load on Bliss\u0027s mind, taking a small amount of added responsibility onmyself, so that she might deal with the wolves of Aurora and the Spacer onSolaria with greater dispatch and with less harm to herself. In addition,I influenced the woman on Comporellon and the one on New Earth, throughBliss, in order to have them look with favor on you, so that you mightcontinue on your journey.\"Trevize smiled, half-sadly. \"I ought to have known it wasn\u0027t I.\"Daneel accepted the statement without its rueful self-deprecation. \"Onthe contrary, sir,\" he said, \"it was you in considerable part. Each of thetwo women looked with favor upon you from the start. I merely strengthenedthe impulse already present about all one can safely do under thestrictures of the Laws of Robotics. Because of those strictures andfor other reasons as well it was only with great difficulty that Ibrought you here, and only indirectly. I was in great danger at severalpoints of losing you.\"\"And now I am here,\" said Trevize. \"What is it you wantof me? To confirm my decision in favor of Galaxia?\"Daneel\u0027s face, always expressionless, somehow managed to seemdespairing. \"No, sir. The mere decision is no longer enough. I broughtyou here, as best I could in my present condition, for something farmore desperate. I am dying.\"102Perhaps it was because of the matter-of-fact way in whichDaneel said it; or perhaps because a lifetime of twenty thousand yearsmade death seem no tragedy to one doomed to live less than half a percentof that period; but, in any case, Trevize felt no stir of sympathy. \"Die? Can a machine die?\"\"I can cease to exist, sir. Call it by whatever word you wish. Iam old. Not one sentient being in the Galaxy that was alive when Iwas first given consciousness is still alive today; nothing organic;nothing robotic. Even I myself lack continuity.\"\"In what way?\"\"There is no physical part of my body, sir, that has escapedreplacement, not only once but many times. Even my positronic brain hasbeen replaced on five different occasions. Each time the contents of myearlier brain were etched into the newer one to the last positron. Eachtime, the new brain had a greater capacity and complexity than the old,so that there was room for more memories, and for faster decision andaction. But \"\"But?\"\"The more advanced and complex the brain, the more unstable it is,and the more quickly it deteriorates. My present brain is a hundredthousand times as sensitive as my first, and has ten million timesthe capacity; but whereas my first brain endured for over ten thousandyears, the present one is but six hundred years old and is unmistakablysenescent. With every memory of twenty thousand years perfectlyrecorded and with a perfect recall mechanism in place, the brain isfilled. There is a rapidly declining ability to reach decisions; an evenmore rapidly declining ability to test and influence minds at hyperspatialdistances. Nor can I design a sixth brain. Further miniaturization willrun against the blank wall of the uncertainty principle, and furthercomplexity will but assure decay almost at once.\"Pelorat seemed desperately troubled. \"But surely, Daneel, Gaiacan carry on without you. Now that Trevize has judged and selectedGalaxia \"\"The process simply took too long, sir,\" said Daneel, as alwaysbetraying no emotion. \"I had to wait for Gaia to be fully established,despite the unanticipated difficulties that arose. By the time a humanbeing Mr. Trevize was located who was capable of makingthe key decision, it was too late. Do not think, however, that I tookno measure to lengthen my life span. Little by little I have reducedmy activities, in order to conserve what I could for emergencies. WhenI could no longer rely on active measures to preserve the isolation ofthe Earth/moon system, I adopted passive ones. Over a period of years,the humaniform robots that have been working with me have been, one byone, called home. Their last tasks have been to remove all references toEarth in the planetary archives. And without myself and my fellow-robotsin full play, Gaia will lack the essential tools to carry through thedevelopment of Galaxia in less than an inordinate period of time.\"\"And you knew all this,\" said Trevize, \"when I made my decision?\"\"A substantial time before, sir,\" said Daneel. \"Gaia, of course,did not know.\"\"But then,\" said Trevize angrily, \"what was the use of carryingthrough the charade? What good has it been? Ever since my decision, Ihave scoured the Galaxy, searching for Earth and what I thought of as its`secret\u0027 not knowing the secret was you in order that I mightconfirm the decision. Well, I have confirmed it. I know now that Galaxiais absolutely essential and it appears to be all for nothing. Whycould you not have left the Galaxy to itself and me to myself?\"Daneel said, \"Because, sir, I have been searching for a way out,and I have been carrying on in the hope that I might find one. I thinkI have. Instead of replacing my brain with yet another positronic one,which is impractical, I might merge it with a human brain instead; ahuman brain that is not affected by the Three Laws, and will not onlyadd capacity to my brain, but add a whole new level of abilities aswell. That is why I have brought you here.\"Trevize looked appalled. \"You mean you plan to merge a human braininto yours? Have the human brain lose its individuality so that you canachieve a two-brain Gaia?\"\"Yes, sir. It would not make me immortal, but it might enable me tolive long enough to establish Galaxia.\"\"And you brought me here for that? You want myindependence of the Three Laws and my sense of judgment made part ofyou at the price of my individuality? No!\"Daneel said, \"Yet you said a moment ago that Galaxia is essentialfor the welfare of the human \"\"Even if it is, it would take a long time to establish, and I wouldremain an individual in my lifetime. On the other hand, if it wereestablished rapidly, there would be a Galactic loss of individualityand my own loss would be part of an unimaginably greater whole. I would,however, certainly never consent to lose my individuality while the restof the Galaxy retains theirs.\"Daneel said, \"It is, then, as I thought. Your brain would not mergewell and, in any case, it would serve a better purpose if you retainedan independent judgmental ability.\"\"When did you change your mind? You said that it was for merging thatyou brought me here.\"\"Yes, and only by using the fullest extent of my greatly diminishedpowers. Still, when I said, `That is why I have brought you here,\u0027 please remember that in Galactic Standard, the word `you\u0027 representsthe plural as well as the singular. I was referring to all of you.\"Pelorat stiffened in his seat. \"Indeed? Tell me then, Daneel,would a human brain that was merged with your brain share in all yourmemories all twenty thousand years of it, back to legendarytimes?\"\"Certainly, sir.\"Pelorat drew a long breath. \"That would fulfill a lifetime search,and it is something I would gladly give up my individuality for. Pleaselet me have the privilege of sharing your brain.\"Trevize asked softly, \"And Bliss? What about her?\"Pelorat hesitated for no more than a moment. \"Bliss will understand,\"he said. \"She will, in any case, be better off without me aftera while.\"Daneel shook his head. \"Your offer, Dr. Pelorat, is a generous one,but I cannot accept it. Your brain is an old one and it cannot survivefor more than two or three decades at best, even in a merger with myown. I need something else. See!\" He pointed and said, \"I\u0027ve calledher back.\"Bliss was returning, walking happily, with a bounce to her steps. Pelorat rose convulsively to his feet. \"Bliss! Oh no!\"\"Do not be alarmed, Dr. Pelorat,\" said Daneel. \"I cannot useBliss. That would merge me with Gaia, and I must remain independent ofGaia, as I have already explained.\"\"But in that case,\" said Pelorat, \"who \"And Trevize, looking at the slim figure running after Bliss, said,\"The robot has wanted Fallom all along, Janov.\"103Bliss returned, smiling, clearly in a state of greatpleasure. \"We couldn\u0027t pass beyond the bounds of the estate,\" she said,\"but it all reminded me very much of Solaria. Fallom, of course, isconvinced it is Solaria. I asked her if she didn\u0027t think that Daneelhad an appearance different from that of Jemby after all, Jembywas metallic and Fallom said, `No, not really.\u0027 I don\u0027t know whatshe meant by `not really.\u0027\"She looked across to the middle distance where Fallom was now playingher flute for a grave Daneel, whose head nodded in time. The soundreached them, thin, clear, and lovely. \"Did you know she took the flute with her when we left the ship?\" askedBliss. \"I suspect we won\u0027t be able to get her away from Daneel for quitea while.\"The remark was met with a heavy silence, and Bliss looked at the twomen in quick alarm. \"What\u0027s the matter?\"Trevize gestured gently in Pelorat\u0027s direction. It was up to him,the gesture seemed to say. Pelorat cleared his throat and said, \"Actually, Bliss, I think thatFallom will be staying with Daneel permanently.\"\"Indeed?\" Bliss, frowning, made as though to walk in Daneel\u0027sdirection, but Pelorat caught her arm. \"Bliss dear, you can\u0027t. He\u0027s morepowerful than Gaia even now, and Fallom must stay with him if Galaxia isto come into existence. Let me explain and, Golan, please correctme if I get anything wrong.\"Bliss listened to the account, her expression sinking into somethingclose to despair. Trevize said, in an attempt at cool reason, \"You see how it is,Bliss. The child is a Spacer and Daneel was designed and put togetherby Spacers. The child was brought up by a robot and knew nothing elseon an estate as empty as this one. The child has transductive powerswhich Daneel will need, and she will live for three or four centuries,which may be what is required for the construction of Galaxia.\"Bliss said, her cheeks flushed and her eyes moist, \"I suppose thatthe robot maneuvered our trip to Earth in such a way as to make us passthrough Solaria in order to pick up a child for his use.\"Trevize shrugged. \"He may simply have taken advantage of theopportunity. I don\u0027t think his powers are strong enough at the momentto make complete puppets of us at hyperspatial distances.\"\"No. It was purposeful. He made certain that I would feel stronglyattracted to the child so that I would take her with me, rather thanleave her to be killed; that I would protect her even against you whenyou showed nothing but resentment and annoyance at her being with us.\"Trevize said, \"That might just as easily have been your Gaian ethics,which Daneel could have strengthened a bit, I suppose. Come, Bliss,there\u0027s nothing to be gained. Suppose you could take Fallomaway. Where could you then take her that would make her as happy as sheis here? Would you take her back to Solaria where she would be killedquite pitilessly; to some crowded world where she would sicken and die;to Gaia, where she would wear her heart out longing for Jemby; on anendless voyage through the Galaxy, where she would think that everyworld we came across was her Solaria? And would you find a substitutefor Daneel\u0027s use so that Galaxia could be constructed?\"Bliss was sadly silent. Pelorat held out his hand to her, a bit timidly. \"Bliss,\" he said,\"I volunteered to have my brain fused with Daneel\u0027s. He wouldn\u0027t take itbecause he said I was too old. I wish he had, if that would have savedFallom for you.\"Bliss took his hand and kissed it. \"Thank you, Pel, but the pricewould be too high, even for Fallom.\" She took a deep breath, and triedto smile. \"Perhaps, when we get back to Gaia, room will be found in theglobal organism for a child for me and I will place Fallom in thesyllables of its name.\"And now Daneel, as though aware that the matter was settled, waswalking toward them, with Fallom skipping along at his side. The youngster broke into a run and reached them first. She said toBliss, \"Thank you, Bliss, for taking me home to Jemby again and for takingcare of me while weeeere on the ship. I shall always remember you.\" Thenshe flung herself at Bliss and the two held each other tightly. \"I hope you will always be happy,\" said Bliss. \"I will remember you,too, Fallom dear,\" and released her with reluctance. Fallom turned to Pelorat, and said, \"Thank you, too, Pel, for lettingme read your book-films.\" Then, without an additional word, and after atrace of hesitation, the thin, girlish hand was extended to Trevize. Hetook it for a moment, then let it go. \"Good luck, Fallom,\" he muttered. Daneel said, \"I thank you all, sirs and madam, for what you havedone, each in your own way. You are free to go now, for your searchis ended. As for my own work, it will be ended, too, soon enough, andsuccessfully now.\"But Bliss said, \"Wait, weeare not quite through. We don\u0027t know yetwhether Trevize is still of the mind that the proper future for humanityis Galaxia, as opposed to a vast conglomeration of Isolates.\"Daneel said, \"He has already made that clear a while ago, madam. Hehas decided in favor of Galaxia.\"Bliss\u0027s lips tightened. \"I\u0027d rather hear that from him. Whichis it to be, Trevize?\"Trevize said calmly, \"Which do you want it to be, Bliss? If I decideagainst Galaxia, you may get Fallom back.\"Bliss said, \"I am Gaia. I must know your decision, and its reason,for the sake of the truth and nothing else.\"Daneel said, \"Tell her, sir. Your mind, as Gaia is aware, isuntouched.\"And Trevize said, \"The decision is for Galaxia. There is no furtherdoubt in my mind on that point.\"104Bliss remained motionless for the time one might taketo count to fifty at a moderate rate, as though sheeeere allowing theinformation to reach all parts of Gaia, and then sheesaid, \"Why?\"Trevize said, \"Listen to me. I knew from the start that there eere twopossible futures for humanity Galaxia, or else the Second Empire ofSeldon\u0027s Plan. And it seemed to me that those two possible futures eeremutually exclusive. We couldn\u0027t have Galaxia unless, for some reason,Seldon\u0027s Plan had some fundamental flaw in it. \"Unfortunately, I knew nothing about Seldon\u0027s Plan except for the twoaxioms on which it is based: one, that there be involved a large enoughnumber of human beings to allow humanity to be treated statistically asa group of individuals interacting randomly; and second, that humanitynot know the results of psychohistorical conclusions before the resultsare achieved. \"Since I had already decided in favor of Galaxia, I felt I must besubliminally aware of flaws in Seldon\u0027s Plan, and those flaws could onlybe in the axioms, which eere all I knew of the plan. Yet I could seenothing wrong with the axioms. I strove, then, to find Earth, feelingthat Earth could not be so thoroughly hidden for no purpose. I had tofind out what that purpose was. \"I had no real reason to expect to find a solution once I found Earth,but I was desperate and could think of nothing else to do. Andperhaps Daneel\u0027s desire for a Solarian child helped drive me. \"In any case, we finally reached Earth, and then the moon, and Blissdetected Daneel\u0027s mind, which he, of course, was deliberately reachingout to her. She described that mind as neither quite human nor quiterobotic. In hindsight, that proved to make sense, for Daneel\u0027s brain isfar advanced beyond any robot that ever existed, and would not be sensedas simply robotic. Neither would it be sensed as human, however. Peloratreferred to it as `something new\u0027 and that served as a trigger for`something new\u0027 of my own; a new thought. \"Just as, long ago, Daneel and his colleagueeeorked out a fourthlaw of robotics that was more fundamental than the other three, so Icould suddenly see a third basic axiom of psychohistory that was morefundamental than the other two; a third axiom so fundamental that noone ever bothered to mention it. \"Here it is. The two known axioms deal with human beings, and they arebased on the unspoken axiom that human beings are the only intelligentspecies in the Galaxy, and therefore the only organisms whose actionsare significant in the development of society and history. That is theunstated axiom: that there is only one species of intelligence in theGalaxy and that it is Homo Sapiens . If there were `something new,\u0027 if there were other species of intelligence widely different in nature,then their behavior would not be described accurately by the mathematicsof psychohistory and Seldon\u0027s Plan would have no meaning. Do you see?\"Trevize was almost shaking with the earnest desire to make himselfunderstood. \"Do you see?\" he repeated. Pelorat said, \"Yes, I see, but as devil\u0027s advocate, oldchap \"\"Yes? Go on.\"\"Human beings are the only intelligences in theGalaxy.\"\"Robots?\" said Bliss. \"Gaia?\"Pelorat thought awhile, then said hesitantly , \"Robots haveplayed no significant role in human history since the disappearanceof the Spacers. Gaia has played no significant role until veryrecently. Robots are the creation of human beings, and Gaia is thecreation of robots and both robots and Gala, insofar as theymust be bound by the Three Laws, have no choice but to yield to humanwill. Despite the twenty thousand years Daneel has labored, and the longdevelopment of Gaia, a single word from Golan Trevize, a human being,would put an end to both those labors and that development. It follows,then, that humanity is the only significant species of intelligence inthe Galaxy, and psychohistory remains valid.\"\"The only form of intelligence in the Galaxy,\" repeated Trevizeslowly. \"I agree. Yet we speak so much and so often of the Galaxy that itis all but impossible for us to see that this is not enough. The Galaxyis not the universe. There are other galaxies.\"Pelorat and Bliss stirred uneasily. Daneel listened with benigngravity, his hand slowly stroking Fallom\u0027s hair. Trevize said, \"Listen to me again. Just outside the Galaxy are theMagellanic Clouds, where no human ship has ever penetrated. Beyond thatare other small galaxies, and not very far away is the giant AndromedaGalaxy, larger than our own. Beyond that are galaxies by the billions. \"Our own Galaxy has developed only one species of an intelligence greatenough to develop a technological society, but what do we know of theother galaxies? Ours may be atypical. In some of the others perhapseven in all there may be many competing intelligent species,struggling with each other, and each incomprehensible to us. Perhapsit is their mutual struggle that preoccupies them, but what if, in somegalaxy, one species gains domination over the rest and then has time toconsider the possibility of penetrating other galaxies. \"Hyperspatially, the Galaxy is a point and so is all theUniverse. We have not visited any other galaxy, and, as far as we know,no intelligent species from another galaxy has ever visited us butthat state of affairs may end someday. And if the invaders come, theyare bound to find ways of turning some human beings against other humanbeings. We have so long had only ourselves to fight that we are usedto such internecine quarrels. An invader that finds us divided againstourselves will dominate us all, or destroy us all. The only true defenseis to produce Galaxia, which cannot be turned against itself and whichcan meet invaders with maximum power.\"Bliss said, \"The picture you paint is a frightening one. Will we havetime to form Galaxia?\"Trevize looked up, as though to penetrate the thick layer ofmoonrock that separated him from the surface and from space; as thoughto force himself to see those far distant galaxies, moving slowly throughunimaginable vistas of space. He said, \"In all human history, no other intelligence has impingedon us, to our knowledge. This need only continue a few more centuries,perhaps little more than one ten thousandth of the time civilizationhas already existed, and we will be safe.
