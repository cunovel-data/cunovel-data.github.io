The few faintdots of light beneath them dimmed and vanished, and as the atmospheregrew thinner with height, the ship\u0027s speed grew greater, and the dotsof light in the sky above them grew more numerous and brighter. \\n\\n Eventually, they looked down upon the planet, Alpha, with only acrescent illuminated and that crescent largely wreathed in clouds. \\n\\n Pelorat said, \"I suppose they don\u0027t have an active spacetechnology. They can\u0027t follow us.\"\"I\u0027m not sure that that cheers me up much,\" said Trevize, his facedour, his voice disheartened. \"I\u0027m infected.\"\"But with an inactive strain,\" said Bliss. \\n\\n \"Still, it can be made active. They had a method. What is themethod?\"Bliss shrugged. \"Hiroko said the virus, left inactive, would eventuallydie in a body unadapted to it as yours is.\"\"Yes?\" said Trevize angrily. \"How does she know that? For that matter,how do I know that Hiroko\u0027s statement wasn\u0027t a self-consoling lie? Andisn\u0027t it possible that the method of activation, whatever it is, mightnot be duplicated naturally? A particular chemical, a type of radiation,a a who knows what? I may sicken suddenly, and then thethree of you would die, too. Or if it happens after we have reached apopulated world, there may be a vicious pandemic which fleeing refugeeswould carry to other worlds.\"He looked at Bliss. \"Is there something you can do about it?\"Slowly, Bliss shook her head. \"Not easily. There are parasites makingup Gaia microorganisms, worms. They are a benign part of theecological balance. They live and contribute to the world consciousness,but never overgrow. They live without doing noticeable harm. The troubleis, Trevize, the virus that affects you is not part of Gaia.\"\"You say `not easily,\u0027\" said Trevize, frowning. \"Under thecircumstances, can you take the trouble to do it even though it mightbe difficult? Can you locate the virus in me and destroy it? Can you,failing that, at least strengthen my defenses?\"\"Do you realize what you ask, Trevize? I am not acquainted with themicroscopic flora of your body. I might not easily tell a virus in thecells of your body from the normal genes inhabiting them. It would be evenmore difficult to distinguish between viruses your body is accustomed toand those with which Hiroko infected you. I will try to do it, Trevize,but it will take time and I may not succeed.\"\"Take time,\" said Trevize. \"Try.\"\"Certainly,\" said Bliss. \\n\\n Pelorat said, \"If Hiroko told the truth, Bliss, you might be able tofind viruses that seem to be already diminishing in vitality, and youcould accelerate their decline.\"\"I could do that,\" said Bliss. \"It is a good thought.\"\"You won\u0027t weaken?\" said Trevize. \"You will have to destroy preciousbits of life when you kill those viruses, you know.\"\"You are being sardonic, Trevize,\" said Bliss coolly, \"but, sardonicor not, you are pointing out a true difficulty. Still, I can scarcelyfail to put you ahead of the virus. I will kill them if I have thechance, never fear. After all, even if I fail to consider you\" andher mouth twitched as though she were repressing a smile \"thencertainly Pelorat and Fallom are also at risk, and you might feel moreconfidence in my feeling for them than in my feeling for you. You mighteven remember that I myself am at risk.\"\"I have no faith in your self-love,\" muttered Trevize. \"You\u0027reperfectly ready to give up your life for some high motive. I\u0027ll acceptyour concern for Pelorat, however.\" Then, he said, \"I don\u0027t hear Fallom\u0027sflute. Is anything wrong with her?\"\"No,\" said Bliss. \"She\u0027s asleep. A perfectly natural sleep that Ihad nothing to do with. And I would suggest that, after you work out theJump to the star we think is Earth\u0027s sun, we all do likewise. I need itbadly and I suspect you do, too, Trevize.\"\"Yes, if I can manage. You were right, you know, Bliss.\"\"About what, Trevize?\"\"About Isolates. New Earth was not a paradise, however much itmight have seemed like one. That hospitality all that outgoingfriendliness at first was to put us off our guard, so that oneof us might be easily infected. And all the hospitality afterward,the festivals of this and that, were designed to keep us there till thefishing fleet returned and the activation could be carried through. Andit would have worked but for Fallom and her music. It might be you wereright there, too.\"\"About Fallom?\"\"Yes. I didn\u0027t want to take her along, and I\u0027ve never been happy withher being on the ship. It was your doing, Bliss, that we have her hereand it was she who, unwittingly, saved us. And yet \"\"And yet what?\"\"Despite that, I\u0027m still uneasy at Fallom\u0027s presence. Idon\u0027t know why.\"\"If it will make you feel better, Trevize, I don\u0027t know that we canlay all the credit at Fallom\u0027s feet. Hiroko advanced Fallom\u0027s music asher excuse for committing what the other Alphans would surely considerto be an act of treason. She may even have believed this, but there wassomething in her mind in addition, something that I vaguely detectedbut could not surely identify, something that perhaps she was ashamed tolet emerge into her conscious mind. I am under the impression that shefelt a warmth for you, and would not willingly see you die, regardlessof Fallom and her music.\"\"Do you really think so?\" said Trevize, smiling slightly for thefirst time since they had left Alpha. \\n\\n \"I think so. You must have a certain proficiency at dealing withwomen. You persuaded Minister Lizalor to allow us to take our shipand leave Comporellon, and you helped influence Hiroko to save ourlives. Credit where it\u0027s due.\"Trevize smiled more broadly. \"Well, if you say so. On to Earth,then.\" He disappeared into the pilot-room with a step that was almostjaunty. \\n\\n Pelorat, lingering behind, said, \"You soothed him after all, didn\u0027tyou, Bliss?\"\"No, Pelorat, I never touched his mind.\"\"You certainly did when you pampered his male vanity sooutrageously.\"\"Entirely indirect,\" said Bliss, smiling. \\n\\n \"Even so, thank you, Bliss.\"86After the Jump, the star that might well be Earth\u0027ssun was still a tenth of a parsec away. It was the brightest object inthe sky by far, but it was still no more than a star. \\n\\n Trevize kept its light filtered for ease of viewing, and studiedit somberly. \\n\\n He said, \"There seems no doubt that it is the virtual twin of Alpha,the star that New Earth circles. Yet Alpha is in the computer map andthis star is not. We don\u0027t have a name for this star, we aren\u0027t givenits statistics, we lack any information concerning its planetary system,if it has one.\"Pelorat said, \"Isn\u0027t that what we would expect if Earth circlesthis sun? Such a blackout of information would fit with the fact thatall information about Earth seems to have been eliminated.\"\"Yes, but it could also mean that it\u0027s a Spacer world that justhappened not to be on the list on the wall of the Melpomenian building. Wecan\u0027t be altogether sure that that list was complete. Or this starcould be without planets and therefore perhaps not worth listing ona computer map which is primarily used for military and commercialpurposes. Janov, is there any legend that tells of Earth\u0027s sunbeing a mere parsec or so from a twin of itself.\"Pelorat shook his head. \"I\u0027m sorry, Golan, but no such legend occursto me. There may be one, though. My memory isn\u0027t perfect. I\u0027ll searchfor it.\"\"It\u0027s not important. Is there any name given to Earth\u0027s sun?\"\"Some different names are given. I imagine there must be a name ineach of the different languages.\"\"I keep forgetting that Earth had many languages.\"\"It must have had. It\u0027s the only way of making sense out of many ofthe legends.\"Trevize said peevishly, \"Well, then, what do we do? We can\u0027t tellanything about the planetary system from this distance, and we have tomove closer. I would like to be cautious, but there\u0027s such a thing asexcessive and unreasoning caution, and I see no evidence of possibledanger. Presumably anything powerful enough to wipe the Galaxy clean ofinformation about Earth may be powerful enough to wipe us out even atthis distance if they seriously did not wish to be located, but nothing\u0027shappened. It isn\u0027t rational to stay here forever on the mere possibilitythat something might happen if we move closer, is it?\"Bliss said, \"I take it the computer detects nothing that might beinterpreted as dangerous.\"\"When I say I see no evidence of possible danger, it\u0027s the computerI\u0027m relying on. I certainly can\u0027t see anything with the unaided eye. Iwouldn\u0027t expect to.\"\"Then I take it you\u0027re just looking for support in making what youconsider a risky decision. All right, then. I\u0027m with you. We haven\u0027tcome this far in order to turn back for no reason, have we?\"\"No,\" said Trevize. \"What do you say, Pelorat?\"Pelorat said, \"I\u0027m willing to move on, if only out of curiosity. Itwould be unbearable to go back without knowing if we have foundEarth.\"\"Well, then,\" said Trevize, \"we\u0027re all agreed.\"\"Not all,\" said Pelorat. \"There\u0027s Fallom.\"Trevize looked astonished. \"Are you suggesting we consult the child? Ofwhat value would her opinion be even if she had one? Besides, all shewould want would be to get back to her own world.\"\"Can you blame her for that?\" asked Bliss warmly. \\n\\n And because the matter of Fallom had arisen, Trevize became aware ofher flute, which was sounding in a rather stirring march rhythm. \\n\\n \"Listen to her,\" he said. \"Where has she ever heard anything inmarch rhythm?\"\"Perhaps Jemby played marches on the flute for her.\"Trevize shook his head. \"I doubt it. Dance rhythms, I should think,lullabies. Listen, Fallom makes me uneasy. She learns tooquickly.\"\"I help her,\" said Bliss. \"Remember that. Andshe\u0027s very intelligent and she has been extraordinarilystimulated in the time she\u0027s been with us. New sensations have floodedher mind. She\u0027s seen space, different worlds, many people, all for thefirst time.\"Fallom\u0027s march music grew wilder and more richly barbaric. \\n\\n Trevize sighed and said, \"Well, she\u0027s here, and she\u0027s producing musicthat seems to breathe optimism, and delight in adventure. I\u0027ll take thatas her vote in favor of moving in more closely. Let us do so cautiously,then, and check this sun\u0027s planetary system.\"\"If any,\" said Bliss. \\n\\n Trevize smiled thinly. \"There\u0027s a planetary system. It\u0027s a bet. Chooseyour sum.\"87\"You lose,\" said Trevize abstractedly. \"How much moneydid you decide to bet?\"\"None. I never accepted the wager,\" said Bliss. \\n\\n \"Just as well. I wouldn\u0027t like to accept the money, anyway.\"They were some 10 billion kilometers from the sun. It was stillstar-like, but it was nearly 1/4,000 as bright as the average sun wouldhave been when viewed from the surface of a habitable planet. \\n\\n \"We can see two planets under magnification, right now,\" saidTrevize. \"From their measured diameters and from the spectrum of thereflected light, they are clearly gas giants.\"The ship was well outside the planetary plane, and Bliss and Pelorat,staring over Trevize\u0027s shoulder at the viewscreen, found themselveslooking at two tiny crescents of greenish light. The smaller was in thesomewhat thicker phase of the two. \\n\\n Trevize said, \"Janov! It is correct, isn\u0027t it, that Earth\u0027s sun issuppose to have four gas giants.\"\"According to the legends. Yes,\" said Pelorat. \\n\\n \"The nearest of the four to the sun is the largest, and the secondnearest has rings. Right?\"\"Large prominent rings, Golan. Yes. Just the same, old chap, you haveto allow for exaggeration in the telling and retelling of a legend. If weshould not find a planet with an extraordinary ring system, I don\u0027t thinkwe ought to let that count seriously against this being Earth\u0027s star.\"\"Nevertheless, the two we see may be the farthest, and the twonearer ones may well be on the other side of the sun and too far to beeasily located against the background of stars. We\u0027ll have to move stillcloser and beyond the sun to the other side.\"\"Can that be done in the presence of the star\u0027s nearby mass?\"\"With reasonable caution, the computer can do it, I\u0027m sure. If itjudges the danger to be too great, however, it will refuse to budge us,and we can then move in cautious, smaller steps.\"His mind directed the computer and the starfield on theviewscreen changed. The star brightened sharply and then moved off theviewscreen as the computer, following directions, scanned the sky foranother gas giant. It did so successfully. \\n\\n All three onlookers stiffened and stared, while Trevize\u0027s mind,almost helpless with astonishment, fumbled at the computer to directfurther magnification. \\n\\n \"Incredible,\" gasped Bliss. \\n\\n 88A gas giant was in view, seen at an angle that allowedmost of it to be sunlit. About it, there curved a broad and brilliantring of material, tipped so as to catch the sunlight on the side beingviewed. It was brighter than the planet itself and along it, one thirdof the way in toward the planet, was a narrow, dividing line. \\n\\n Trevize threw in a request for maximum enhancement and the ring becameringlets, narrow and concentric, glittering in the sunlight. Only aportion of the ring system was visible on the viewscreen and the planetitself had moved off. A further direction from Trevize and one cornerof the screen marked itself off and showed, within itself, a miniatureof the planet and rings under lesser magnification. \\n\\n \"Is that sort of thing common?\" asked Bliss, awed. \\n\\n \"No,\" said Trevize. \"Almost every gas giant has rings of debris, butthey tend to be faint and narrow. I once saw one in which the rings werenarrow, but quite bright. But I never saw anything like this; or heardof it, either.\"Pelorat said, \"That\u0027s clearly the ringed giant the legends speakof. If this is really unique \"\"Really unique, as far as I know, or as far as the computer knows,\"said Trevize. \\n\\n \"Then this must be the planetary system containingEarth. Surely, no one could invent such a planet. It would have had tohave been seen to be described.\"Trevize said, \"I\u0027m prepared to believe just about anything your legendssay now. This is the sixth planet and Earth would be the third?\"\"Right, Golan.\"\"Then I would say we were less than 1.5 billion kilometers from Earth,and we haven\u0027t been stopped. Gaia stopped us when we approached.\"Bliss said, \"You were closer to Gaia when you were stopped.\"\"Ah,\" said Trevize, \"but it\u0027s my opinion Earth is more powerful thanGaia, and I take this to be a good sign. If we are not stopped, it maybe that Earth does not object to our approach.\"\"Or that there is no Earth,\" said Bliss. \\n\\n \"Do you care to bet this time?\" asked Trevize grimly. \\n\\n \"What I think Bliss means,\" put in Pelorat, \"is that Earth may beradioactive as everyone seems to think, and that no one stops us becausethere is no life on the Earth.\"\"No,\" said Trevize violently. \"I\u0027ll believe everything that\u0027s saidabout Earth, but that. We\u0027ll just close in on Earth andsee for ourselves. And I have the feeling we won\u0027t be stopped.\"89The gas giants were well behind. An asteroid beltlay just inside the gas giant nearest the sun. (That gas giant was thelargest and most massive, just as the legends said.)Inside the asteroid belt were four planets. \\n\\n Trevize studied them carefully. \"The third is the largest. The sizeis appropriate and the distance from the sun is appropriate. It couldbe habitable.\"Pelorat caught what seemed to be a note of uncertainty in Trevize\u0027swords. \\n\\n He said, \"Does it have an atmosphere?\"\"Oh yes,\" said Trevize. \"The second, third, and fourth planets allhave atmospheres. And, as in the old children\u0027s tale, the second\u0027s istoo dense, the fourth\u0027s is not dense enough, but the third\u0027s is justright.\"\"Do you think it might be Earth, then?\"\"Think?\" said Trevize almost explosively. \"I don\u0027t have to think. Itis Earth. It has the giant satellite you told me of.\"\"It has?\" And Pelorat\u0027s face broke into a wider smile than any thatTrevize had ever seen upon it. \\n\\n \"Absolutely! Here, look at it under maximum magnification.\"Pelorat saw two crescents, one distinctly larger and brighter thanthe other. \\n\\n \"Is that smaller one the satellite?\" he asked. \\n\\n \"Yes. It\u0027s rather farther from the planet than one might expect butit\u0027s definitely revolving about it. It\u0027s only the size of a small planet;in fact, it\u0027s smaller than any of the four inner planets circling thesun. Still, it\u0027s large for a satellite. It\u0027s at least two thousandkilometers in diameter, which makes it in the size range of the largesatellites that revolve about gas giants.\"\"No larger?\" Pelorat seemed disappointed. \"Then it\u0027s not a giantsatellite?\"\"Yes, it is. A satellite with a diameter of two to three thousandkilometers that is circling an enormous gas giant is one thing. That samesatellite circling a small, rocky habitable planet is quite another. Thatsatellite has a diameter over a quarter that of Earth. Where have youheard of such near-parity involving a habitable planet?\"Pelorat said timidly, \"I know very little of such things.\"Trevize said, \"Then take my word for it, Janov. It\u0027s unique. We\u0027relooking at something that is practically a double planet, and there arefew habitable planets that have anything more than pebbles orbitingthem. Janov, if you consider that gas giant with its enormous ringsystem in sixth place, and this planet with its enormous satellite inthird both of which your legends told you about, against allcredibility, before you ever saw them then that world you\u0027relooking at must be Earth. It cannot conceivably be anythingelse. We\u0027ve found it, Janov; we\u0027ve found it.\"90THey were on the second day of their coasting progresstoward Earth, and Bliss yawned over the dinner meal. She said, \"It seemsto me we\u0027ve spent more time coasting toward and away from planets thananything else. We\u0027ve spent weeks at it, literally.\"\"Partly,\" said Trevize, \"that\u0027s because Jumps are dangeroustoo close to a star. And in this case, we\u0027removing very slowly because I do not wish to advance into possible dangertoo quickly.\"\"I thought you said you had the feeling we would not be stopped.\"\"So I do, but I don\u0027t want to stake everything on a feeling.\" Trevizelooked at the contents of the spoon before putting it into his mouthand said, \"You know, I miss the fish we had on Alpha. We only had threemeals there.\"\"A pity,\" agreed Pelorat. \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Bliss, \"we visited five worlds and had to leave eachone of them so hurriedly that we never had time to add to our foodsupplies and introduce variety. Even when the world had food to offer,as did Comporellon and Alpha, and, presumably \"She did not complete the sentence, for Fallom, looking up quickly,finished it for her. \"Solaria? Could you get no food there? There isplenty of food there. As much as on Alpha. And better, too.\"\"I know that, Fallom,\" said Bliss. \"There was just no time.\"Fallom stared at her solemnly. \"Will I ever see Jemby again,Bliss? Tell me the truth.\"Bliss said, \"You may, if we return to Solaria.\"\"Will we ever return to Solaria?\"Bliss hesitated. \"I cannot say.\"\"Now we go to Earth, is that right? Isn\u0027t that the planet where yousay we all originate?\"\"Where our forebears originated,\" said Bliss. \\n\\n \"I can say `ancestors,\u0027\" said Fallom. \\n\\n \"Yes, we are going to Earth.\"Bliss said lightly, \"Wouldn\u0027t anyone wish to see the world of theirancestors?\"\"I think there\u0027s more to it. You all seem so concerned.\"\"But we\u0027ve never been there before. We don\u0027t know what to expect.\"\"I think it is more than that.\"Bliss smiled. \"You\u0027ve finished eating, Fallom dear, so why not goto the room and let us have a little serenade on your flute. You\u0027replaying it more beautifully all the time. Come, come.\" She gave Falloman accelerating pat on the rear end, and off Fallom went, turning onlyonce to give Trevize a thoughtful look. \\n\\n Trevize looked after her with clear distaste. \"Does that thing readminds?\"\"Don\u0027t call her a `thing,\u0027 Trevize,\" said Bliss sharply. \\n\\n \"Does she read minds? You ought to be able to tell.\"\"No, she doesn\u0027t. Nor can Gaia. Nor can the SecondFoundationers. Reading minds in the sense of overhearing a conversation,or making out precise ideas is not something that can be done now, or inthe foreseeable future. We can detect, interpret, and, to some extent,manipulate emotions, but that is not the same thing at all.\"\"How do you know she can\u0027t do this thing that supposedly can\u0027t bedone?\"\"Because as you have just said, I ought to be able to tell.\"\"Perhaps she is manipulating you so that you remain ignorant of thefact that she can.\"Bliss rolled her eyes upward. \"Be reasonable, Trevize. Even if she hadunusual abilities, she could do nothing with me for I am not Bliss, I amGaia. You keep forgetting. Do you know the mental inertia representedby an entire planet? Do you think one Isolate, however talented, canovercome that?\"\"You don\u0027t know everything, Bliss, so don\u0027t be overconfident,\" saidTrevize sullenly. \"That th She has been with us notvery long. I couldn\u0027t learn anything but the rudiments of a language inthat time, yet she already speaks Galactic perfectly and with virtuallya full vocabulary. Yes, I know you\u0027ve been helping her, but I wish youwould stop.\"\"I told you I was helping her, but I also told you she\u0027s fearfullyintelligent. Intelligent enough so that I would like to have her part ofGaia. If we can gather her in; if she\u0027s still young enough; we might learnenough about the Solarians to absorb that entire world eventually. Itmight well be useful to us.\"\"Does it occur to you that the Solarians are pathological Isolateseven by my standards?\"\"They wouldn\u0027t stay so as part of Gaia.\"\"I think you\u0027re wrong, Bliss. I think that Solarian child is dangerousand that we should get rid of her.\"\"How? Dump her through the airlock? Kill her, chop her up, and addher to our food supply?\"Pelorat said, \"Oh, Bliss.\"And Trevize said, \"That\u0027s disgusting, and completely uncalled for.\" Helistened for a moment. The flute was sounding without flaw or waver,and they had been talking in half-whispers. \"When this is all over, we\u0027vegot to return her to Solaria, and make sure that Solaria is forever cutoff from the Galaxy. My own feeling is that it should be destroyed. Idistrust and fear it.\"Bliss thought awhile and said, \"Trevize, I know that you have the knackof coming to a right decision, but I also know you have been antipatheticto Fallom from the start. I suspect that may just be because you werehumiliated on Solaria and have taken a violent hatred to the planet andits inhabitants as a result. Since I must not tamper with your mind,I can\u0027t tell that for sure. Please remember that if we had not takenFallom with us, we would be on Alpha right now dead and, I presume,buried.\"\"I know that, Bliss, but even so \"\"And her intelligence is to be admired, not envied.\"\"I do not envy her. I fear her.\"\"Her intelligence?\"Trevize licked his lips thoughtfully. \"No, not quite.\"\"What, then?\"\"I don\u0027t know. Bliss, if I knew what I feared, I might not have tofear it. It\u0027s something I don\u0027t quite understand.\" His voice lowered,as though he were speaking to himself. \"The Galaxy seems to be crowdedwith things I don\u0027t understand. Why did I choose Gaia? Why must I findEarth? Is there a missing assumption in psychohistory? If there is,what is it? And on top of all that, why does Fallom make me uneasy?\"Bliss said, \"Unfortunately, I can\u0027t answer those questions.\" She rose,and left the room. \\n\\n Pelorat looked after her, then said, \"Surely things aren\u0027t totallyblack, Golan. We\u0027re getting closer and closer to Earth and once we reachit all mysteries may be solved. And so far nothing seems to be makingany effort to stop us from reaching it.\"Trevize\u0027s eyes flickered toward Pelorat and he said in a low voice,\"I wish something would.\"Pelorat said, \"You do? Why should you want that?\"\"Frankly, I\u0027d welcome a sign of life.\"Pelorat\u0027s eyes opened wide. \"Have you found that Earth is radioactiveafter all?\"\"Not quite. But it is warm. A bit warmer than I would haveexpected.\"\"Is that bad?\"\"Not necessarily. It may be rather warm but that wouldn\u0027t make itnecessarily uninhabitable. The cloud cover is thick and it is definitelywater vapor, so that those clouds, together with a copious water ocean,could tend to keep things livable despite the temperature we calculatedfrom microwave emission. I can\u0027t be sure, yet. It\u0027s just that \"\"Yes, Golan?\"\"Well, if Earth were radioactive, that might well account for itsbeing warmer than expected.\"\"But that doesn\u0027t argue the reverse, does it? If it\u0027s warmer thanexpected, that doesn\u0027t mean it must be radioactive.\"\"No. No, it doesn\u0027t.\" Trevize managed to force a smile. \"No usebrooding, Janov. In a day or two, I\u0027ll be able to tell more about itand we\u0027ll know for sure.\"91Fallom was sitting on the cot in deep thought whenBliss came into the room. Fallom looked up briefly, then down again. \\n\\n Bliss said quietly, \"What\u0027s the matter, Fallom?\"Fallom said, \"Why does Trevize dislike me so much, Bliss?\"\"What makes you think he dislikes you.\"\"He looks at me impatiently Is that the word?\"\"It might be the word.\"\"He looks at me impatiently when I am near him. His face always twistsa little.\"\"Trevize is having a hard time, Fallom.\"\"Because he\u0027s looking for Earth?\"\"Yes.\"Fallom thought awhile, then said, \"He is particularly impatient whenI think something into moving.\"Bliss\u0027s lips tightened. \"Now, Fallom, didn\u0027t I tell you you must notdo that, especially when Trevize is present?\"\"Well, it was yesterday, right here in this room, and he was in thedoorway and I didn\u0027t notice. I didn\u0027t know he was watching. It was justone of Pel\u0027s book-films, anyway, and I was trying to make it stand onone tip. I wasn\u0027t doing any harm.\"\"It makes him nervous, Fallom, and I want you not to do it, whetherhe\u0027s watching or not.\"\"Does it make him nervous because he can\u0027t do it?\"\"Perhaps.\"\"Can you do it?\"Bliss shook her head slowly. \"No, I can\u0027t.\"\"It doesn\u0027t make you nervous when I do it. It doesn\u0027t make Pel nervous,either.\"\"People are different.\"\"I know,\" said Fallom, with a sudden hardness that surprised Blissand caused her to frown. \\n\\n \"What do you know, Fallom?\"\" I\u0027m different.\"\"Of course, I just said so. People are different.\"\"My shape is different. I can move things.\"\"That\u0027s true.\"Fallom said, with a shade of rebelliousness, \"I must move things. Trevize should not be angry with me for that, and you shouldnot stop me.\"\"But why must you move things?\"\"It is practice. Exerceez. Is that the right word?\"\"Not quite. Exercise.\"\"Yes. Jemby always said I must train my my \"\"Transducer-lobes?\"\"Yes. And make them strong. Then, when I was grown up, I could powerall the robots. Even Jemby.\"\"Fallom, who did power all the robots if you did not?\"\"Bander.\" Fallom said it very matter-of-factly. \\n\\n \"Did you know Bander?\"\"Of course. I viewed him many times. I was to be the nextestate-head. The Bander estate would become the Fallom estate. Jembytold me so.\"\"You mean Bander came to your \"Fallom\u0027s mouth made a perfect O of shock. She said in a choked voice,\"Bander would never come to \" The youngster ran out of breath andpanted a bit, then said, \"I viewed Bander\u0027s image.\"Bliss asked hesitantly, \"How did Bander treat you?\"Fallom looked at Bliss with a faintly puzzled eye. \"Bander would askme if I needed anything; if I was comfortable. But Jemby was always nearme so I never needed anything and I was always comfortable.\"Her head bent and she stared at the floor. Then she placed her handsover her eyes and said, \"But Jemby stopped. I think it was because Banderstopped, too.\"Bliss said, \"Why do you say that?\"\"I\u0027ve been thinking about it. Bander powered all the robots, and ifJemby stopped, and all the other robots, too, it must be that Banderstopped. Isn\u0027t that so?\"Bliss was silent. \\n\\n Fallom said, \"But when you take me back to Solaria I will power Jembyand all the rest of the robots, and I will be happy again.\"She was sobbing. \\n\\n Bliss said, \"Aren\u0027t you happy with us, Fallom? Just alittle? Sometimes?\"Fallom lifted her tear-stained face to Bliss and her voice trembledas she shook her head and said, \"I want Jemby.\"In an agony of sympathy, Bliss threw her arms about the youngster. \"Oh,Fallom, how I wish I could bring you and Jemby together again,\" and wassuddenly aware that she was weeping, too. \\n\\n 92Pelorat entered and found them so. He halted in mid-stepand said, \"What\u0027s the matter?\"Bliss detached herself and fumbled for a small tissue so that shemight wipe her eyes. She shook her head, and Pelorat at once said,with heightened concern, \"But what\u0027s the matter ?\"Bliss said, \"Fallom, just rest a little. I\u0027ll think of something tomake things a little better for you. Remember I love you just thesame way that Jemby did.\"She seized Pelorat\u0027s elbow and rushed him out into the living room,saying, \"It\u0027s nothing, Pel. Nothing.\"\"It\u0027s Fallom, though, isn\u0027t it? She still misses Jemby.\"\"Terribly. And there\u0027s nothing we can do about it. I can tell herthat I love her and, truthfully, I do. How can you help loving achild so intelligent and gentle? Fearfully intelligent. Trevizethinks too intelligent. She\u0027s seen Bander in her time,you know or viewed it, rather, as a holographic image. She\u0027s notmoved by that memory, however; she\u0027s very cold and matter-of-fact aboutit, and I can understand why. There was only the fact that Bander wasowner of the estate and that Fallom would be the next owner that boundthem. No other relationship at all.\"\"Does Fallom understand that Bander is her father?\"\"Her mother . If we agree that Fallom is to be regardedas feminine, so is Bander.\"\"Either way, Bliss dear. Is Fallom aware of the parentalrelationship?\"\"I don\u0027t know that she would understand what that is. She may, ofcourse, but she gave no hint. However, Pel, she has reasoned out thatBander is dead, for it\u0027s dawned on her that Jemby\u0027s inactivation must bethe result of power loss and since Bander supplied the power Thatfrightens me.\"Pelorat said thoughtfully, \"Why should it, Bliss? It\u0027s only a logicalinference, after all.\"\"Another logical inference can be drawn from that death. Deathsmust be few and far distant on Solaria with its long-lived and isolatedSpacers. Experience of natural death must be a limited one for any ofthem, and probably absent altogether for a Solarian child of Fallom\u0027sage. If Fallom continues to think of Bander\u0027s death, she\u0027s going to beginto wonder why Bander died, and the fact that it happenedwhen we strangers were on the planet will surely lead her to the obviouscause and effect.\"\"That we killed Bander?\"\"It wasn\u0027t we who killed Bander, Pel. It was I .\"\"She couldn\u0027t guess that.\"\"But I would have to tell her that. She is annoyed with Trevize as itis, and he is clearly the leader of the expedition. She would take itfor granted that it would be he who would have brought about the deathof Bander, and how could I allow Trevize to bear the blame unjustly?\"\"What would it matter, Bliss? The child feels nothing for herfath mother. Only for her robot, Jemby.\"\"But the death of the mother meant the death of her robot, too. Ialmost did own up to my responsibility. I was strongly tempted.\"\"Why?\"\"So I could explain it my way. So I could soothe her, forestall herown discovery of the fact in a reasoning process that would work it outin a way that would offer no justification for it.\"\"But there was justification. It was self-defense. Ina moment, we all would have been dead, if you had not acted.\"\"It\u0027s what I would have said, but I could not bring myself toexplain. I was afraid she wouldn\u0027t believe me.\"Pelorat shook his head. He said, sighing, \"Do you suppose it mighthave been better if we had not brought her? The situation makes youso unhappy.\"\"No,\" said Bliss angrily, \"don\u0027t say that. It would have mademe infinitely more unhappy to have to sit here right now and rememberthat we had left an innocent child behind to be slaughtered mercilesslybecause of what we had done.\"\"It\u0027s the way of Fallom\u0027s world.\"\"Now, Pel, don\u0027t fall into Trevize\u0027s way of thinking. Isolatesfind it possible to accept such things and think no more about it. Theway of Gaia is to save life, however, not destroy it or to sitidly by while it is destroyed. Life of all kinds must, we all know,constantly be coming to an end in order that other life might endure,but never uselessly, never to no end. Bander\u0027s death, though unavoidable,is hard enough to bear; Fallom\u0027s would have been past all bounds.\"\"Ah well,\" said Pelorat, \"I suppose you\u0027re right. And in anycase, it is not the problem of Fallom concerning which I\u0027ve come to seeyou. It\u0027s Trevize.\"\"What about Trevize?\"\"Bliss, I\u0027m worried about him. He\u0027s waiting to determine the factsabout Earth, and I\u0027m not sure he can withstand the strain.\"\"I don\u0027t fear for him. I suspect he has a sturdy and stable mind.\"\"We all have our limits. Listen, the planet Earth is warmer than heexpected it to be; he told me so. I suspect that he thinks it may be toowarm for life, though he\u0027s clearly trying to talk himself into believingthat\u0027s not so.\"\"Maybe he\u0027s right. Maybe it\u0027s not too warm for life.\"\"Also, he admits it\u0027s possible that the warmth might possibly arisefrom a radioactive crust, but he is refusing to believe that also. -Ina day or two, we\u0027ll be close enough so that the truth of the matter willbe unmistakable. What if Earth is radioactive?\"\"Then he\u0027ll have to accept the fact.\"\"But I don\u0027t know how to say this, or how to put it in mentalterms. What if his mind \"Bliss waited, then said wryly, \"Blows a fuse?\"\"Yes. Blows a fuse. Shouldn\u0027t you do something now to strengthenhim? Keep him level and under control, so to speak?\"\"No, Pel. I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s that fragile, and there is a firmGaian decision that his mind must not be tampered with.\"\"But that\u0027s the very point. He has this unusual `rightness,\u0027 orwhatever you want to call it. The shock of his entire project fallingto nothingness at the moment when it seems successfully concluded maynot destroy his brain, but it may destroy his `rightness.\u0027 It\u0027s a veryunusual property he has. Might it not be unusually fragile, too?\"Bliss remained for a moment in thought. Then she shrugged. \"Well,perhaps I\u0027ll keep an eye on him.\"93For the next thirty-six hours, Trevize was vaguelyaware that Bliss and, to a lesser degree, Pelorat, tended to dog hisfootsteps. Still, that was not utterly unusual in a ship as compact astheirs, and he had other things on his mind. \\n\\n Now, as he sat at the computer, he was aware of them standing justinside the doorway. He looked up at them, his face blank. \\n\\n \"Well?\" he said, in a very quiet voice. \\n\\n Pelorat said, rather awkwardly, \"How are you, Golan?\"Trevize said, \"Ask Bliss. She\u0027s been staring at me intently forhours. She must be poking through my mind. Aren\u0027t you, Bliss?\"\"No, I am not,\" said Bliss evenly, \"but if you feel the need for myhelp, I can try. Do you want my help?\"\"No, why should I? Leave me alone. Both of you.\"Pelorat said, \"Please tell us what\u0027s going on.\"\"Guess!\"\"Is Earth \"\"Yes, it is. What everyone insisted on telling us is perfectlytrue.\" Trevize gestured at the viewscreen, where Earth presented itsnightside and was eclipsing the sun. It was a solid circle of blackagainst the starry sky, its circumference outlined by a broken orangecurve. \\n\\n Pelorat said, \"Is that orange the radioactivity?\"\"No. Just refracted sunlight through the atmosphere. It would bea solid orange circle if the atmosphere weren\u0027t so cloudy. We can\u0027tsee the radioactivity. The various radiations, even the gamma rays, areabsorbed by the atmosphere. However, they do set up secondary radiations,comparatively feeble ones, but the computer can detect them. They\u0027restill invisible to the eye, but the computer can produce a photon ofvisible light for each particle or wave of radiation it receives andput Earth into false color. Look.\"And the black circle glowed with a faint, blotchy blue. \\n\\n \"How much radioactivity is there?\" asked Bliss, in a low voice. \"Enoughto signify that no human life can exist there?\"\"No life of any kind,\" said Trevize. \"The planet is uninhabitable. Thelast bacterium, the last virus, is long gone.\"\"Can we explore it?\" said Pelorat. \"I mean, in space suits.\"\"For a few hours before we come down with irreversible radiationsickness.\"\"Then what do we do, Golan?\"\"Do?\" Trevize looked at Pelorat with that same expressionlessface. \"Do you know what I would like to do? I would like to take youand Bliss and the child back to Gaia and leave you allthere forever. Then I would like to go back to Terminus and hand backthe ship. Then I would like to resign from the Council, which ought tomake Mayor Branno very happy. Then I would like to live on my pensionand let the Galaxy go as it will. I won\u0027t care about the Seldon Plan, orabout the Foundation, or about the Second Foundation, or about Gaia. TheGalaxy can choose its own path. It will last my time and why should Icare a snap as to what happens afterward?\"\"Surely, you don\u0027t mean it, Golan,\" said Pelorat urgently. \\n\\n Trevize stared at him for a while, and then he drew a long breath. \"No,I don\u0027t, but, oh, how I wish I could do exactly what I have just outlinedto you.\"\"Never mind that. What will you do?\"\"Keep the ship in orbit about the Earth, rest, get over the shock ofall this, and think of what to do next. Except that \"\"Yes?\"And Trevize blurted out, \"What can I do next? What is there furtherto look for? What is there further to find?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630/48260.html","bookId":5,"book":{"id":5,"title":"基地系列 Foundation and Earth 基地与地球","description":"简介： 基地纪元498年。银河未来的命运决定于某人一念之间，这个就是葛兰崔维兹。他必须在第一基地，第二基地与盖娅之间做出银河未来由谁主导的决定：由第一基地创建的新帝国将会逞领银河进入科技昌明的世纪，却会像第一帝国那样摧毁在战争之中；由第二基地指导的新帝国将能确...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201608/24/13-41-46-87-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
