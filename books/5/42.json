{"id":156,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 20: The Nearby World","content":"94For four successive meals, Pelorat and Bliss had seenTrevize only at meals. During the rest of the time, he was either inthe pilot-room or in his bedroom. At mealtimes, he was silent. His lipsremained pressed together and he ate little. At the fourth meal, however, it seemed to Pelorat that some ofthe unusual gravity had lifted from Trevize\u0027s countenance. Peloratcleared his throat twice, as though preparing to say something and thenretreating. Finally, Trevize looked up at him and said, \"Well?\"\"Have you have you thought it out, Golan?\"\"Why do you ask?\"\"You seem less gloomy.\"\"I\u0027m not less gloomy, but I have beenthinking. Heavily.\"\"May we know what?\" asked Pelorat. Trevize glanced briefly in Bliss\u0027s direction. She was looking firmlyat her plate, maintaining a careful silence, as though certain thatPelorat would get further than she at this sensitive moment. Trevize said, \"Are you also curious, Bliss?\"She raised her eyes for a moment. \"Yes. Certainly.\"Fallom kicked a leg of the table moodily, and said, \"Have we foundEarth?\"Bliss squeezed the youngster\u0027s shoulder. Trevize paid no attention. He said, \"What we must start with is a basic fact. All informationconcerning Earth has been removed on various worlds. That is bound tobring us to an inescapable conclusion. Something on Earth is beinghidden. And yet, by observation, we see that Earth is radioactivelydeadly, so that anything on it is automatically hidden. No one can landon it, and from this distance, when we are quite near the outer edge ofthe magnetosphere and would not care to approach Earth any more closely,there is nothing for us to find.\"\"Can you be sure of that?\" asked Bliss softly. \"I have spent my time at the computer, analyzing Earth in every wayit and I can. There is nothing. What\u0027s more, I feel there isnothing. Why, then, has data concerning the Earth been wiped out? Surely,whatever must be hidden is more effectively hidden now than anyone caneasily imagine, and there need be no human gilding of this particularpiece of gold.\"\"It may be,\" said Pelorat, \"that there was indeed something hiddenon Earth at a time when it had not yet grown so severely radioactive asto preclude visitors. People on Earth may then have feared that someonemight land and find this whatever-it-is. It was then thatEarth tried to remove information concerning itself. What we have nowis a vestigial remnant of that insecure time.\"\"No, I don\u0027t think so,\" said Trevize. \"The removal of informationfrom the Imperial Library at Trantor seems to have taken place veryrecently.\" He turned suddenly to Bliss, \"Am I right?\"Bliss said evenly, \"I/we/Gaia gathered that much from the troubledmind of the Second Foundationer Gendibal, when he, you, and I had themeeting with the Mayor of Terminus.\"Trevize said, \"So whatever must have had to be hidden because thereexisted the chance of finding it must still be in hiding now ,and there must be danger of finding it now despite the factthat Earth is radioactive.\"\"How is that possible?\" asked Pelorat anxiously. \"Consider,\" said Trevize. \"What if what was on Earth is no longeron Earth, but was removed when the radioactive danger grew greater? Yetthough the secret is no longer on Earth, it may be that if we can findEarth, we would be able to reason out the place where the secret hasbeen taken. If that were so, Earth\u0027s whereabouts would still have tobe hidden.\"Fallom\u0027s voice piped up again. \"Because if we can\u0027t find Earth,Bliss says you\u0027ll take me back to Jemby.\"Trevize turned toward Fallom and glared and Bliss said, in alow voice, \"I told you we might , Fallom. We\u0027ll talk aboutit later. Right now, go to your room and read, or play the flute, oranything else you want to do. Go go.\"Fallom, frowning sulkily, left the table. Pelorat said, \"But how can you say that, Golan? Here we are. We\u0027velocated Earth. Can we now deduce where whatever it is might be if itisn\u0027t on Earth?\"It took a moment for Trevize to get over the moment of ill humorFallom had induced. Then, he said, \"Why not? Imagine the radioactivity ofEarth\u0027s crust growing steadily worse. The population would be decreasingsteadily through death and emigration, and the secret, whatever it is,would be in increasing danger. Who would remain to protect it? Eventually,it would have to be shifted to another world, or the use of whateverit was would be lost to Earth. I suspect there would be reluctanceto move it and it is likely that it would be done more or less at thelast minute. Now, then, Janov, remember the old man on New Earth whofilled your ears with his version of Earth\u0027s history?\"\"Monolee?\"\"Yes. He. Did he not say in reference to the establishment of New Earththat what was left of Earth\u0027s population was brought to the planet?\"Pelorat said, \"Do you mean, old chap, that what we\u0027re searching foris now on New Earth? Brought there by the last of Earth\u0027s populationto leave?\"Trevize said, \"Might that not be so? New Earth is scarcely betterknown to the Galaxy in general than Earth is, and the inhabitants aresuspiciously eager to keep all Outworlders away.\"\"We were there,\" put in Bliss. \"We didn\u0027t find anything.\"\"We weren\u0027t looking for anything but the whereabouts of Earth.\"Pelorat said, in a puzzled way, \"But we\u0027re looking for somethingwith a high technology; something that can remove information fromunder the nose of the Second Foundation itself, and even from under thenose excuse me, Bliss of Gaia. Those people on New Earth maybe able to control their patch of weather and may have some techniquesof biotechnology at their disposal, but I think you\u0027ll admit that theirlevel of technology is, on the whole, quite low.\"Bliss nodded. \"I agree with Pel.\"Trevize said, \"We\u0027re judging from very little. We never did see themen of the fishing fleet. We never saw any part of the island but thesmall patch we landed on. What might we have found if we had exploredmore thoroughly? After all, we didn\u0027t recognize the fluorescent lightstill we saw them in action, and if it appeared that the technology waslow, appeared , I say \"\"Yes?\" said Bliss, clearly unconvinced. \"That could be part of the veil intended to obscure the truth.\"\"Impossible,\" said Bliss. \"Impossible? It was you who told me, back on Gaia, that at Trantor,the larger civilization was deliberately held at a level of low technologyin order to hide the small kernel of Second Foundationers. Why mightnot the same strategy be used on New Earth?\"\"Do you suggest, then, that we return to New Earth and face infectionagain this time to have it activated? Sexual intercourse isundoubtedly a particularly pleasant mode of infection, but it may notbe the only one.\"Trevize shrugged. \"I am not eager to return to New Earth, but we mayhave to.\"\" May ?\"\"May! After all, there is another possibility.\"\"What is that?\"\"New Earth circles the star the people call Alpha. But Alpha is part ofa binary system. Might there not be a habitable planet circling Alpha\u0027scompanion as well?\"\"Too dim, I should think,\" said Bliss, shaking her head. \"The companionis only a quarter as bright as Alpha is.\"\"Dim, but not too dim. If there is a planet fairly close to the star,it might do.\"Pelorat said, \"Does the computer say anything about any planets forthe companion?\"Trevize smiled grimly. \"I checked that. There are five planets ofmoderate size. No gas giants.\"\"And are any of the five planets habitable?\"\"The computer gives no information at all about the planets, otherthan their number, and the fact that they aren\u0027t large.\"\"Oh,\" said Pelorat deflated. Trevize said, \"That\u0027s nothing to be disappointed about. None of theSpacer worlds are to be found in the computer at all. The informationon Alpha itself is minimal. These things are hidden deliberately and ifalmost nothing is known about Alpha\u0027s companion, that might almost beregarded as a good sign.\"\"Then,\" said Bliss, in a business-like manner, \"what you are planningto do is this visit the companion and, if that draws a blank,return to Alpha itself.\"\"Yes. And this time when we reach the island of New Earth, we willbe prepared. We will examine the entire island meticulously beforelanding and, Bliss, I expect you to use your mental abilities toshield \"And at that moment, the Far Star lurched slightly, as thoughit had undergone a ship-sized hiccup, and Trevize cried out, halfwaybetween anger and perplexity, \"Who\u0027s at the controls?\"And even as he asked, he knew very well who was. 95Fallom, at the computer console, was completelyabsorbed. Her small, long-fingered hands were stretched wide in order tofit the faintly gleaming handmarks on the desk. Fallom\u0027s hands seemedto sink into the material of the desk, even though it was clearly feltto be hard and slippery. She had seen Trevize hold his hands so on a number of occasions,and she hadn\u0027t seen him do more than that, though it was quite plain toher that in so doing he controlled the ship. On occasion, Fallom had seen Trevize close his eyes, and she closedhers now. After a moment or two, it was almost as though she hearda faint, far-off voice far off, but sounding in her own head,through (she dimly realized) her transducer-lobes. They were even moreimportant than her hands. She strained to make out the words. Instructions, it said, almost pleadingly. What are yourinstructions? Fallom didn\u0027t say anything. She had never witnessed Trevize sayinganything to the computer but she knew what it was that she wantedwith all her heart. She wanted to go back to Solaria, to the comfortingendlessness of the mansion, to Jemby by She wanted to go there and, as she thought of the world she loved,she imagined it visible on the viewscreen as she had seen other worldsshe didn\u0027t want. She opened her eyes and stared at the viewscreen willingsome other world there than this hateful Earth, then staring at what shesaw, imagining it to be Solaria. She hated the empty Galaxy to whichshe had been introduced against her will. Tears came to her eyes, andthe ship trembled. She could feel that tremble, and she swayed a little in response. And then she heard loud steps in the corridor outside and, when sheopened her eyes, Trevize\u0027s face, distorted, filled her vision, blockingout the viewscreen, which held all she wanted. He was shouting something,but she paid no attention. It was he who had taken her from Solaria bykilling Bander, and it was he who was preventing her from returning bythinking only of Earth, and she was not going to listen to him. She was going to take the ship to Solaria, and, with the intensityof her resolve, it trembled again. 96Bliss clutched wildly at Trevize\u0027sarm. \"Don\u0027t! Don\u0027t!\"She clung strongly, holding him back, while Pelorat stood, confusedand frozen, in the background. Trevize was shouting, \"Take your hands off the computer! Bliss,don\u0027t get in my way. I don\u0027t want to hurt you.\"Bliss said, in a tone that seemed almost exhausted, \"Don\u0027t offerviolence to the child. I\u0027d have to hurt you againstall instructions.\"Trevize\u0027s eyes darted wildly from Fallom to Bliss. He said, \"Thenyou get her off, Bliss. Now!\"Bliss pushed him away with surprising strength (drawing it, Trevizethought afterward, from Gaia, perhaps). \"Fallom,\" she said, \"lift your hands.\"\"No,\" shrieked Fallom. \"I want the ship to go to Solaria. I want itto go there. There.\" She nodded toward the viewscreen with her head,unwilling to let even one hand release its pressure on the desk forthe purpose. But Bliss reached for the child\u0027s shoulders and, as her hands touchedFallom, the youngster began to tremble. Bliss\u0027s voice grew soft. \"Now, Fallom, tell the computer to be asit was and come with me. Come with me.\" Her hands stroked the child,who collapsed in an agony of weeping. Fallom\u0027s hands left the desk, and Bliss, catching her under thearmpits, lifted her into a standing position. She turned her, held herfirmly against her breast, and allowed the child to smother her wrenchingsobs there. Bliss said to Trevize, who was now standing dumbly in the doorway,\"Step out of the way, Trevize, and don\u0027t touch either of us as wepass.\"Trevize stepped quickly to one side. Bliss paused a moment, saying in a low voice to Trevize, \"I had to getinto her mind for a moment. If I\u0027ve caused any damage, I won\u0027t forgiveyou easily.\"It was Trevize\u0027s impulse to tell her he didn\u0027t care a cubic millimeterof vacuum for Fallom\u0027s mind; that it was the computer for which hefeared. Against the concentrated glare of Gaia, however (surely it wasn\u0027tonly Bliss whose sole expression could inspire the moment of cold terrorhe felt), he kept silent. He remained silent for a perceptible period, and motionless as well,after Bliss and Fallom had disappeared into their room. He remained so,in fact, until Pelorat said softly, \"Golan, are you all right? She didn\u0027thurt you, did she?\"Trevize shook his head vigorously, as though to shake off the touchof paralysis that had afflicted him. \"I\u0027m all right. The real questionis whether that\u0027s all right.\" He sat down at the computerconsole, his hands resting on the two handmarks which Fallom\u0027s handshad so recently covered. \"Well?\" said Pelorat anxiously. Trevize shrugged. \"It seems to respond normally. I might conceivablyfind something wrong later on, but there\u0027s nothing that seems offnow.\" Then, more angrily, \"The computer should not combine effectivelywith any hands other than mine, but in that hermaphrodite\u0027s case, itwasn\u0027t the hands alone. It was the transducer-lobes, I\u0027m sure \"\"But what made the ship shake? It shouldn\u0027t do that, should it?\"\"No. It\u0027s a gravitic ship and we shouldn\u0027t have these inertialeffects. But that she-monster \" He paused, looking angry again. \"Yes?\"\"I suspect she faced the computer with two self-contradictory demands,and each with such force that the computer had no choice but to attemptto do both things at once. In the attempt to do the impossible, thecomputer must have released the inertia-free condition of the shipmomentarily. At least that\u0027s what I think happened.\"And then, somehow, his face smoothed out. \"And that might be agood thing, too, for it occurs to me now that all my talk about AlphaCentauri and its companion was flapdoodle. I know now where Earth musthave transferred its secret.\"97Pelorat stared, then ignored the final remark andwent back to an earlier puzzle. \"In what way did Fallom ask for twoself-contradictory things?\"\"Well, she said she wanted the ship to go to Solaria.\"\"Yes. Of course, she would.\"\"But what did she mean by Solaria? She can\u0027t recognize Solaria fromspace. She\u0027s never really seen it from space. She was asleep when weleft that world in a hurry. And despite her readings in your library,together with whatever Bliss has told her, I imagine she can\u0027t reallygrasp the truth of a Galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars and millionsof populated planets. Brought up, as she was, underground and alone,it is all she can do to grasp the bare concept that there are differentworlds but how many? Two? Three? Four? To her any world she seesis likely to be Solaria, and given the strength of her wishful thinking,is Solaria. And since I presume Bliss has tried to quiet her by hintingthat if we don\u0027t find Earth, we\u0027ll take her back to Solaria, she mayeven have worked up the notion that Solaria is close to Earth.\"\"But how can you tell this, Golan? What makes you think it\u0027s so?\"\"She as much as told us so, Janov, when we burst in upon her. She criedout that she wanted to go to Solaria and then added `there there,\u0027 nodding her head at the viewscreen. And what is on the viewscreen? Earth\u0027ssatellite. It wasn\u0027t there when I left the machine before dinner; Earthwas. But Fallom must have pictured the satellite in her mind when sheasked for Solaria, and the computer, in response, must therefore havefocused on the satellite. Believe me, Janov, I know how this computerworks. Who would know better?\"Pelorat looked at the thick crescent of light on the viewscreen andsaid thoughtfully, \"It was called `moon\u0027 in at least one of Earth\u0027slanguages; `Luna,\u0027 in another language. Probably many other names,too. Imagine the confusion, old chap, on a world with numerouslanguages the misunderstandings, the complications, the \"\"Moon?\" said Trevize. \"Well, that\u0027s simple enough. Then, too,come to think of it, it may be that the child tried, instinctively,to move the ship by means of its transducer-lobes, using the ship\u0027s ownenergy-source, and that may have helped produce the momentary inertialconfusion. But none of that matters, Janov. What does matter is thatall this has brought this moon yes, I like the name to thescreen and magnified it, and there it still is. I\u0027m looking at it now,and wondering.\"\"Wondering what, Golan?\"\"At the size of it. We tend to ignore satellites, Janov. They\u0027resuch little things, when they exist at all. This one is different,though. It\u0027s a world . It has a diameter of about thirty-fivehundred kilometers.\"\"A world? Surely you wouldn\u0027t call it a world. It can\u0027t behabitable. Even a thirty-five-hundred-kilometer diameter is too small. Ithas no atmosphere. I can tell that just looking at it. No clouds. Thecircular curve against space is sharp, so is the inner curve that boundsthe light and dark hemisphere.\"Trevize nodded, \"You\u0027re getting to be a seasoned space traveler,Janov. You\u0027re right. No air. No water. But that only means the moon\u0027snot habitable on its unprotected surface. What about underground?\"\"Underground?\" said Pelorat doubtfully. \"Yes. Underground. Why not? Earth\u0027s cities were underground, you tellme. We know that Trantor was underground. Comporellon has much of itscapital city underground. The Solarian mansions were almost entirelyunderground. It\u0027s a very common state of affairs.\"\"But, Golan, in every one of these cases, people were living on ahabitable planet. The surface was habitable, too, with an atmosphereand with an ocean. Is it possible to live underground when the surfaceis uninhabitable?? \"Come, Janov, think! Where are we living right now? The Far Star is a tiny world that has an uninhabitable surface. There\u0027s no air orwater on the outside. Yet we live inside in perfect comfort. The Galaxyis full of space stations and space settlements of infinite variety,to say nothing of spaceships, and they\u0027re all uninhabitable except forthe interior. Consider the moon a gigantic spaceship.\"\"With a crew inside?\"\"Yes. Millions of people, for all we know; and plants and animals;and an advanced technology. Look, Janov, doesn\u0027t it make sense? IfEarth, in its last days, could send out a party of Settlers to a planetorbiting Alpha Centauri; and if, possibly with Imperial help, they couldattempt to terraform it, seed its oceans, build dry land where there wasnone; could Earth not also send a party to its satellite and terraformits interior?\"Pelorat said reluctantly, \"I suppose so.\"\"It would be done. If Earth has something to hide,why send it over a parsec away, when it could be hidden on a world lessthan a hundred millionth the distance to Alpha. And the moon would be amore efficient hiding place from the psychological standpoint. No onewould think of satellites in connection with life. For that matter Ididn\u0027t. With the moon an inch before my nose, my thoughts went haringoff to Alpha. If it hadn\u0027t been for Fallom \" His lips tightened,and he shook his head. \"I suppose I\u0027ll have to credit her for that. Blisssurely will if I don\u0027t.\"Pelorat said, \"But see here, old man, if there\u0027s something hidingunder the surface of the moon, how do we find it? There must be millionsof square kilometers of surface \"\"Roughly forty million.\"\"And we would have to inspect all of that, looking for what? Anopening? Some sort of airlock?\"Trevize said, \"Put that way, it would seem rather a task, but we\u0027renot just looking for objects, we\u0027re looking for life; and for intelligentlife at that. And we\u0027ve got Bliss, and detecting intelligence is hertalent, isn\u0027t it?\"98Bliss looked at Trevize accusingly. \"I\u0027ve finally got herto sleep. I had the hardest time. She was wild . Fortunately,I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve damaged her.\"Trevize said coldly, \"You might try removing her fixation on Jemby,you know, since I certainly have no intention of ever going back toSolaria.\"\"Just remove her fixation, is that it? What do you know about suchthings, Trevize? You\u0027ve never sensed a mind. You haven\u0027t the faintestidea of its complexity. If you knew anything at all about it, you wouldn\u0027ttalk about removing a fixation as though it were just a matter of scoopingjam out of a jar.\"\"Well, weaken it at least.\"\"I might weaken it a bit, after a month of careful dethreading.\"\"What do you mean, dethreading?\"\"To someone who doesn\u0027t know, it can\u0027t be explained.\"\"What are you going to do with the child, then?\"\"I don\u0027t know yet; it will take a lot of consideration.\"\"In that case,\" said Trevize, \"let me tell you what we\u0027re going todo with the ship.\"\"I know what you\u0027re going to do. It\u0027s back to New Earth and another tryat the lovely Hiroko, if she\u0027ll promise not to infect you this time.\"Trevize kept his face expressionless. He said, \"No, as a matter offact. I\u0027ve changed my mind. We\u0027re going to the moon which is thename of the satellite, according to Janov.\"\"The satellite? Because it\u0027s the nearest world at hand? I hadn\u0027tthought of that.\"\"Nor I. Nor would anyone have thought of it. Nowhere in the Galaxyis there a satellite worth thinking about but this satellite,in being large, is unique. What\u0027s more, Earth\u0027s anonymity covers it aswell. Anyone who can\u0027t find the Earth can\u0027t find the moon, either.\"\"Is it habitable?\"\"Not on the surface, but it is not radioactive, not at all, so itisn\u0027t absolutely uninhabitable. It may have life it may be teemingwith life, in fact under the surface. And, of course, you\u0027ll beable to tell if that\u0027s so, once we get close enough.\"Bliss shrugged. \"I\u0027ll try. But, then, what made you suddenlythink of trying the satellite?\"Trevize said quietly, \"Something Fallom did when she was at thecontrols.\"Bliss waited, as though expecting more, then shrugged again. \"Whateverit was, I suspect you wouldn\u0027t have gotten the inspiration if you hadfollowed your own impulse and killed her.\"\"I had no intention of killing her, Bliss.\"Bliss waved her hand. \"All right. Let it be. Are we moving towardthe moon now?\"\"Yes. As a matter of caution, I\u0027m not going too fast, but if all goeswell, we\u0027ll be in its vicinity in thirty hours.\"99The moon was a wasteland. Trevize watched the brightdaylit portion drifting past them below. It was a monotonous panoramaof crater rings and mountainous areas, and of shadows black against thesunlight. There were subtle color changes in the soil and occasionalsizable stretches of flatness, broken by small craters. As they approached the nightside, the shadows grew longer and finallyfused together. For a while, behind them, peaks glittered in the sun,like fat stars, far outshining their brethren in the sky. Then theydisappeared and below was only the fainter light of the Earth in thesky, a large bluish-white sphere, a little more than half full. The shipfinally outran the Earth, too, which sank beneath the horizon so thatunder them was unrelieved blackness, and above only the faint powderingof stars, which, to Trevize, who had been brought up on the starlessworld of Terminus, was always miracle enough. Then, new bright stars appeared ahead, first just one or two, thenothers, expanding and thickening and finally coalescing. And at once theypassed the terminator into the daylit side. The sun rose with infernalsplendor, while the viewscreen shifted away from it at once and polarizedthe glare of the ground beneath. Trevize could see quite well that it was useless to hope to find anyway into the inhabited interior (if that existed) by mere eye inspectionof this perfectly enormous world. He turned to look at Bliss, who sat beside him. She did not look atthe viewscreen; indeed, she kept her eyes closed. She seemed to havecollapsed into the chair rather than to be sitting in it. Trevize, wondering if she were asleep, said softly, \"Do you detectanything else?\"Bliss shook her head very slightly. \"No,\" she whispered. \"There wasjust that faint whiff. You\u0027d better take me back there. Do you knowwhere that region was?\"\"The computer knows.\"It was like zeroing in on a target, shifting this way and that and thenfinding it. The area in question was still deep in the nightside and,except that the Earth shone fairly low in the sky and gave the surfacea ghostly ashen glow between the shadows, there was nothing to make out,even though the light in the pilot-room had been blacked out for betterviewing. Pelorat had approached and was standing anxiously in the doorway. \"Havewe found anything?\" he asked, in a husky whisper. Trevize held up his hand for silence. He was watching Bliss. He knewit would be days before sunlight would return to this spot on the moon,but he also knew that for what Bliss was trying to sense, light of anykind was irrelevant. She said, \"It\u0027s there.\"\"Are you sure?\"\"Yes.\"\"And it\u0027s the only spot?\"\"It\u0027s the only spot I\u0027ve detected. Have you been over every part ofthe moon\u0027s surface?\"\"We\u0027ve been over a respectable fraction of it.\"\"Well, then, in that respectable fraction, this is all I havedetected. It\u0027s stronger now, as though it has detectedus and it doesn\u0027t seem dangerous. The feeling I get is awelcoming one.\"\"Are you sure?\"\"It\u0027s the feeling I get.\"Pelorat said, \"Could it be faking the feeling?\"Bliss said, with a trace of hauteur, \"I would detect a fake, I assureyou.\"Trevize muttered something about overconfidence, then said, \"Whatyou detect is intelligence, I hope.\"\"I detect strong intelligence. Except \" And an odd note enteredher voice. \"Except what?\"\"Ssh. Don\u0027t disturb me. Let me concentrate.\" The last word was a meremotion of her lips. Then she said, in faint elated surprise, \"It\u0027s not human.\"\"Not human,\" said Trevize, in much stronger surprise. \"Are we dealingwith robots again? As on Solaria?\"\"No.\" Bliss was smiling. \"It\u0027s not quite robotic, either.\"\"It has to be one or the other.\"\"Neither.\" She actually chuckled. \"It\u0027s not human, and yet it\u0027s notlike any robot I\u0027ve detected before.\"Pelorat said, \"I would like to see that.\" He nodded his headvigorously, his eyes wide with pleasure. \"It would be exciting. Somethingnew.\"\"Something new,\" muttered Trevize with a sudden lift of his ownspirits and a flash of unexpected insight seemed to illuminatethe interior of his skull. 100Down they sank to the moon\u0027s surface, in what was almostjubilation. Even Fallom had joined them now and, with the abandonmentof a youngster, was hugging herself with unbearable joy as though shewere truly returning to Solaria. As for Trevize, he felt within himself a touch of sanity tellinghim that it was strange that Earth or whatever of Earth was onthe moon which had taken such measures to keep off all others,should now be taking measures to draw them in. Could the purpose be thesame in either way? Was it a case of \"If you can\u0027t make them avoid you,draw them in and destroy them?\" Either way, would not Earth\u0027s secretremain untouched? But that thought faded and drowned in the flood of joy that deepenedsteadily as they came closer to the moon\u0027s surface. Yet over and beyondthat, he managed to cling to the moment of illumination that had reachedhim just before they had begun their gliding dive to the surface of theEarth\u0027s satellite. He seemed to have no doubt as to where the ship was going. Theywere just above the tops of the rolling hills now, and Trevize, atthe computer, felt no need to do anything. It was as though he and thecomputer, both, were being guided, and he felt only an enormous euphoriaat having the weight of responsibility taken away from him. They were sliding parallel to the ground, toward a cliff that raisedits menacing height as a barrier against them; a barrier glisteningfaintly in Earth-shine and in the light-beam of the Far Star . Theapproach of certain collision seemed to mean nothing to Trevize, and itwas with no surprise whatever that he became aware that the section ofcliff directly ahead had fallen away and that a corridor, gleaming inartificial light, had opened before them. The ship slowed to a crawl, apparently of its own accord, and fittedneatly into the opening entering sliding along Theopening closed behind it, and another then opened before it. Throughthe second opening went the ship, into a gigantic hall that seemed thehollowed interior of a mountain. The ship halted and all aboard rushed to the airlock eagerly. Itoccurred to none of them, not even to Trevize, to check. whether theremight be a breathable atmosphere outside or any atmosphere atall. There was air, however. It was breathable and it wascomfortable. They looked about themselves with the pleased air of peoplewho had somehow come home and it was only after a while that they becameaware of a man who was waiting politely for them to approach. He was tall, and his expression was grave. His hair was bronze incolor, and cut short. His cheekbones were broad, his eyes were bright,and his clothing was rather after the fashion one saw in ancient historybooks. Although he seemed sturdy and vigorous there was, just the same,an air of weariness about him not in anything that one could see,but rather in something appealing to no recognizable sense.
