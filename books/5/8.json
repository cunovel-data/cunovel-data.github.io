{"id":122,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 3: At the Entry Station","content":"9Bliss, entering their chamber, said, \"Did Trevizetell you that we are going make the Jump and go through hyperspace anymoment now?\"Pelorat, who was bent over his viewing disk, looked up, and said,\"Actually, he just looked in and told me `within the half-hour.\u0027\"\"I don\u0027t like the thought of it, Pel. I\u0027ve never liked the Jump. Iget a funny inside-out feeling.\"Pelorat looked a bit surprised. \"I had not thought of you as a spacetraveler, Bliss dear.\"\"I\u0027m not particularly, and I don\u0027t mean that this is so only in myaspect as a component. Gaia itself has no occasion for regular spacetravel. By my/our/Gaia\u0027s very nature, I/we/Gaia don\u0027t explore, trade,or space junket. Still, there is the necessity of having someone at theentry stations \"\"As when we were fortunate enough to meet you.\"\"Yes, Pel.\" She smiled at him affectionately. \"Or even to visitSayshell and other stellar regions, for various reasons usuallyclandestine. But, clandestine or not, that always means the Jump and,of course, when any part of Gaia Jumps, all of Gaia feels it.\"\"That\u0027s too bad,\" said Pel. \\n\\n \"It could be worse. The large mass of Gaia is not undergoing the Jump, so the effect is greatly diluted. However, Iseem to feel it much more than most of Gaia. As I keep trying to tellTrevize, though all of Gaia is Gaia, the individual components are notidentical. We have our differences, and my makeup is, for some reason,particularly sensitive to the Jump.\"\"Wait!\" said Pelorat, suddenly remembering. \"Trevize explained that tome once. It\u0027s in ordinary ships that you have the worst of the sensation. \\n\\n In ordinary ships, one leaves the Galactic gravitational field on enteringhyperspace, and comes back to it on returning to ordinary space. It\u0027s theleaving and returning that produces the sensation. But the Far Star is a gravitic ship. It is independent of the gravitational field, anddoes not truly leave it or return to it. For that reason, we won\u0027t feela thing. I can assure you of that, dear, out of personal experience.\"\"But that\u0027s delightful. I wish I had thought to discuss the matterearlier. I would have saved myself considerable apprehension.\"\"That\u0027s an advantage in another way,\" said Pelorat, feeling anexpansion of spirit in his unusual role as explainer of mattersastronautic. \"The ordinary ship has to recede from large masses suchas stars for quite a long distance through ordinary space in orderto make the Jump. Part of the reason is that the closer to a star,the more intense the gravitational field, and the more pronounced arethe sensations of a Jump. Then, too, the more intense the gravitationalfield the more complicated the equations that must be solved in orderto conduct the Jump safely and end at the point in ordinary space youwish to end at. \\n\\n \"In a gravitic ship, however, there is no Jump-sensation to speakof. In addition, this ship has a computer that is a great deal moreadvanced than ordinary computers and it can handle complex equationswith unusual skill and speed. The result is that instead of having tomove away from a star for a couple of weeks just to reach a safe andcomfortable distance for a Jump, the Far Star need travel for onlytwo or three days. This is especially so since we are not subject to agravitational field and, therefore, to inertial effects I admitI don\u0027t understand that, but that\u0027s what Trevize tells me and canaccelerate much more rapidly than an ordinary ship could.\"Bliss said, \"That\u0027s fine, and it\u0027s to Trev\u0027s credit that he can handlethis unusual ship.\"Pelorat frowned slightly. \"Please, Bliss. Say `Trevize.\u0027\"\"I do. I do. In his absence, however, I relax a little.\"\"Don\u0027t. You don\u0027t want to encourage the habit even slightly, dear. He\u0027sso sensitive about it.\"\"Not about that. He\u0027s sensitive about me. He doesn\u0027t like me.\"\"That\u0027s not so,\" said Pelorat earnestly. \"I talked to him aboutthat. Now, now, don\u0027t frown. I was extraordinarily tactful, dearchild. He assured me he did not dislike you. He is suspicious of Gaiaand unhappy over the fact that he has had to make it into the future ofhumanity. We have to make allowances for that. He\u0027ll get over it as hegradually comes to understand the advantages of Gaia.\"\"I hope so, but it\u0027s not just Gaia. Whatever he may tell you,Pel and remember that he\u0027s very fond of you and doesn\u0027t want tohurt your feelings he dislikes me personally.\"\"No, Bliss. He couldn\u0027t possibly.\"\"Not everyone is forced to love me simply because you do, Pel. Letme explain. Trev all right, Trevize thinks I\u0027m a robot.\"A look of astonishment suffused Pelorat\u0027s ordinarily stolidfeatures. He said, \"Surely he can\u0027t think you\u0027re an artificial humanbeing.\"\"Why is that so surprising? Gaia was settled with the help ofrobots. That\u0027s a known fact.\"\"Robots might help, as machines night, but it was people who settled Gaia; people from Earth. That\u0027s what Trevize thinks. I knowhe does.\"\"There is nothing in Gaia\u0027s memory about Earth as I told you andTrevize. However, in our oldest memories there are still some robots,even after three thousand years, working at the task of completing themodification of Gaia into a habitable world. We were at that time alsoforming Gaia as a planetary consciousness that took a long time,Pel dear, and that\u0027s another reason why our early memories are dim,and perhaps it wasn\u0027t a matter of Earth wiping them out, as Trevizethinks \"\"Yes, Bliss,\" said Pelorat anxiously, \"but what of the robots?\"\"Well, as Gaia formed, the robots left. We did not want a Gaia thatincluded robots, for we were, and are, convinced that a robotic componentis, in the long run, harmful to a human society, whether Isolate innature or Planetary. I don\u0027t know how we came to that conclusion but itis possible that it is based on events dating back to a particularlyearly time in Galactic history, so that Gaia\u0027s memory does not extendback to it.\"\"If the robots left \"\"Yes, but what if some remained behind? What if I am one ofthem fifteen thousand years old perhaps. Trevize suspects that.\"Pelorat shook his head slowly. \"But you\u0027re not.\"\"Are you sure you believe that?\"\"Of course I do. You\u0027re not a robot.\"\"How do you know?\"\"Bliss, I know . There\u0027s nothing artificial about you. IfI don\u0027t know that , no one does.\"\"Isn\u0027t it possible I may be so cleverly artificial that in everyrespect, from largest to smallest, I am indistinguishable from thenatural. If I were, how could you tell the difference between me and atrue human being?\"Pelorat said, \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible for you to be so cleverlyartificial.\"\"What if it were possible, despite what you think?\"\"I just don\u0027t believe it.\"\"Then let\u0027s just consider it is a hypothetical case. If I were anindistinguishable robot, how would you feel about it?\"\"Well, I I \"\"To be specific. How would you feel about making love to a robot?\"Pelorat snapped the thumb and mid-finger of his right hand,suddenly. \"You know, there are legends of women falling in lovewith artificial men, and vice versa. I always thought there was anallegorical significance to that and never imagined the tales couldrepresent literal truth. Of course, Golan and I never even heardthe word `robot\u0027 till we landed on Sayshell, but, now that I think ofit, those artificial men and women must have been robots. Apparently,such robots did exist in early historic times. That means the legendsshould be reconsidered \"He fell into silent thought, and, after Bliss had waited a moment,she suddenly clapped her hands sharply. Pelorat jumped. \\n\\n \"Pel dear,\" said Bliss. \"You\u0027re using your mythography to escapethe question. The question is: How would you feel about making love toa robot?\"He stared at her uneasily. \"A truly undistinguishable one? One thatyou couldn\u0027t tell from a human being?\"\"Yes.\"\"It seems to me, then, that a robot that can in no way be distinguishedfrom a human being is a human being. If you were such arobot, you would be nothing but a human being to me.\"\"That\u0027s what I wanted to hear you say, Pel.\"Pelorat waited, then said, \"Well, then, now that you\u0027ve heard me sayit, dear, aren\u0027t you going to tell me that you are a natural human beingand that I don\u0027t have to wrestle with hypothetical situations?\"\"No. I will do no such thing. You\u0027ve defined a natural human beingas an object that has all the properties of a natural human being. Ifyou are satisfied that I have all those properties, then that ends thediscussion. We\u0027ve got the operational definition and need no other. Afterall, how do I know that you\u0027re not just a robot who happensto be indistinguishable from a human being?\"\"Because I tell you that I am not.\"\"Ah, but if you were a robot that was indistinguishable from a humanbeing, you might be designed to tell me you were a natural human being,and you might even be programmed to believe it yourself. The operationaldefinition is all we have, and all we can have.\"She put her arms about Pelorat\u0027s neck and kissed him. The kiss grewmore passionate, and prolonged itself until Pelorat managed to say,in somewhat muffled fashion, \"But we promised Trevize not to embarrasshim by converting this ship into a honeymooners\u0027 haven.\"Bliss said coaxingly, \"Let\u0027s be carried away and not leave ourselvesany time to think of promises.\"Pelorat, troubled, said, \"But I can\u0027t do that, dear. I knowit must irritate you, Bliss, but I am constantly thinking and I amconstitutionally averse to letting myself be carried away by emotion. It\u0027sa lifelong habit, and probably very annoying to others. I\u0027ve neverlived with a woman who didn\u0027t seem to object to it sooner or later. Myfirst wife but I suppose it would be inappropriate to discussthat \"\"Rather inappropriate, yes, but not fatally so. You\u0027re not my firstlover either.\"\"Oh!\" said Pelorat, rather at a loss, and then, aware of Bliss\u0027ssmall smile, he said, \"I mean, of course not. I wouldn\u0027t expect myselfto have been Anyway, my first wife didn\u0027t like it.\"\"But I do. I find your endless plunging into thought attractive.\"\"I can\u0027t believe that , but I do have anotherthought. Robot or human, that doesn\u0027t matter. We agree on that. However,I am an Isolate and you know it. I am not part of Gaia, and when weare intimate, you\u0027re sharing emotions outside Gaia even when you letme participate in Gaia for a short period, and it may not be the sameintensity of emotion then that you would experience if it were Gaialoving Gaia.\"Bliss said, \"Loving you, Pel, has its own delight. I look no fartherthan that.\"\"But it\u0027s not just a matter of you loving me. You aren\u0027t merelyyou. What if Gaia considers it a perversion?\"\"If it did, I would know, for I am Gaia. And since I have delight inyou, Gaia does. When we make love, all of Gaia shares the sensation tosome degree or other. When I say I love you, that means Gaia loves you,although it is only the part that I am that is assigned the immediaterole. You seem confused.\"\"Being an Isolate, Bliss, I don\u0027t quite grasp it.\"\"One can always form an analogy with the body of an Isolate. Whenyou whistle a tune, your entire body, you as an organism,wishes to whistle the tune, but the immediate task of doing so is assignedto your lips, tongue, and lungs. Your right big toe does nothing.\"\"It might tap to the tune.\"\"But that is not necessary to the act of whistling. The tapping ofthe big toe is not the action itself but is a response to the action,and, to be sure, all parts of Gaia might well respond in some small wayor other to my emotion, as I respond to theirs.\"Pelorat said, \"I suppose there\u0027s no use feeling embarrassed aboutthis.\"\"None at all.\"\"But it does give me a queer sense of responsibility. When I try tomake you happy, I find that I must be trying to make every last organismon Gaia happy.\"\"Every last atom but you do. You add to the sense of communaljoy that I let you share briefly. I suppose your contribution is toosmall to be easily measurable, but it is there, and knowing it is thereshould increase your joy.\"Pelorat said, \"I wish I could be sure that Golan is sufficiently busywith his maneuvering through hyperspace to remain in the pilot-room forquite a while.\"\"You wish to honeymoon, do you?\"\"I do.\"\"Than get a sheet of paper, write `Honeymoon Haven\u0027 on it, affixIt to the outside of the door, and if he wants to enter, that\u0027s hisproblem.\"Pelorat did so, and it was during the pleasurable proceedings thatfollowed that the Far Star made the Jump. Neither Pelorat norBliss detected the action, nor would they have, had they been payingattention. \\n\\n 10It had been only a matter of a few months since Pelorat had metTrevize and had left Terminus for the first time. Until then, for themore than half-century (Galactic Standard) of his life, he had beenutterly planet-bound. \\n\\n In his own mind, he had in those months become an old space dog. He hadseen three planets from space: Terminus itself, Sayshell, and Gaia. And onthe viewscreen, he now saw a fourth, albeit through a computer-controlledtelescopic device. The fourth was Comporellon. \\n\\n And again, for the fourth time, he was vaguely disappointed. Somehow,he continued to feel that looking down upon a habitable world from spacemeant seeing an outline of its continents against a surrounding sea; or,if it were a dry world, the outline of its lakes against a surroundingbody of land. \\n\\n It was never so. \\n\\n If a world was habitable, it had an atmosphere as well as ahydrosphere. And if it had both air and water, it had clouds; and ifit had clouds, it had an obscured view. Once again, then, Pelorat foundhimself looking down on white swirls with an occasional glimpse of paleblue or rusty brown. \\n\\n He wondered gloomily if anyone could identify a world if a viewof it from, say, three hundred thousand kilometers, were cast upon ascreen. How does one tell one cloud swirl from another? \\n\\n Bliss looked at Pelorat with some concern. \"What is it, Pel? You seemto be unhappy.\"\"I find that all planets look alike from space.\"Trevize said, \"What of that, Janov? So does every shoreline onTerminus, when it is on the horizon, unless you know what you\u0027re lookingfor a particular mountain peak, or a particular offshore islet ofcharacteristic shape.\"\"I dare say,\" said Pelorat, with clear dissatisfaction, \"but what doyou look for in a mass of shifting clouds? And even if you try, beforeyou can decide, you\u0027re likely to be moving into the dark side.\"\"Look a little more carefully, Janov. If you follow the shape of theclouds, you see that they tend to fall into a pattern that circles theplanet and that moves about a center. That center is more or less atone of the poles.\"\"Which one?\" asked Bliss with interest. \\n\\n \"Since, relative to ourselves, the planet is rotating in clockwisefashion, we are looking down, by definition, upon the south pole. Sincethe center seems to be about fifteen degrees from the terminator theplanet\u0027s line of shadow and the planetary axis is tilted twenty-onedegrees to the perpendicular of its plane of revolution, we\u0027re eitherin mid-spring or mid-summer depending on whether the pole is moving awayfrom the terminator or toward it. The computer can calculate its orbit andtell me in short order if I were to ask it. The capital is on the northernside of the equator so it is either in mid-fall or mid-winter.\"Pelorat frowned. \"You can tell all that?\" He looked at the cloudlayer as though he thought it would, or should, speak to him now, but,of course, it didn\u0027t. \\n\\n \"Not only that,\" said Trevize, \"but if you\u0027ll look at the polarregions, you\u0027ll see that there are no breaks in the cloud layer as thereare away from the poles. Actually, there are breaks, but through thebreaks you see ice, so it\u0027s a matter of white on white.\"\"Ah,\" said Pelorat. \"I suppose you expect that at the poles.\"\"Of habitable planets, certainly. Lifeless planets might be airless orwaterless, or might have certain stigmata showing that the clouds are notwater a clouds, or that the ice is not water ice. This planet lacks thosestigmata, so we know we are looking at water clouds and water ice. \\n\\n \"The next thing we notice is the size of the area of unbrokenwhite on the day side of the terminator, and to the experienced eye itis at once seen as larger than average. Furthermore, you can detecta certain orange glint, a quite faint one, to the reflected light,and that means Comporellon\u0027s sun if rather cooler than Terminus\u0027ssun. Although Comporellon is closer to its sun than Terminus is tohers, it is not sufficiently closer to make up for its star\u0027s lowertemperature. Therefore, Comporellon is a cold world as habitable worldsgo.\"\"You read it like a film, old chap,\" said Pelorat admiringly. \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be too impressed,\" said Trevize, smiling affectionately. \"Thecomputer has given me the applicable statistics of the world, includingits slightly low average temperature. It is easy to deduce somethingyou already know. In fact, Comporellon is at the edge of an ice ageand would be having one, if the configuration of its continents weremore suitable to such a condition.\"Bliss bit at her lower lip. \"I don\u0027t like a cold world.\"\"We\u0027ve got warm clothing,\" said Trevize. \\n\\n \"That doesn\u0027t matter. Human beings aren\u0027t adapted to cold weather,really. We don\u0027t have thick coats of hair or feathers, or a subcutaneouslayer of blubber. For a world to have cold weather seems to indicate acertain indifference to the welfare of its own parts.\"Trevize said, \"Is Gaia a uniformly mild world?\"\"Most of it, yes. There are some cold areas for cold-adapted plants andanimals, and some hot areas for heat-adapted plants and animals, but mostparts are uniformly mild, never getting uncomfortably hot or uncomfortablycold, for those between, including human beings, of course.\"\"Human beings, of course. All parts of Gaia are alive and equal inthat respect, but some, like human beings, are obviously more equalthan other.\"\"Don\u0027t be foolishly sarcastic,\" said Bliss, with a trace ofwaspishness. \"The level and intensity of consciousness and awarenessare important. A human being is a more useful portion of Gaia than arock of the same weight would be, and the properties and functions ofGaia as a whole are necessarily weighted in the direction of the humanbeing not as much so as on your Isolate worlds, however. What\u0027smore, there are times when it is weighted in other directions, whenthat is needed for Gaia as a whole. It might even, at long intervals,be weighted in the direction of the rocky interior. That, too, demandsattention or, in the lack of that attention all parts of Gaia mightsuffer. We wouldn\u0027t want an unnecessary volcanic eruption, would we?\"\"No,\" said Trevize. \"Not an unnecessary one.\"\"You\u0027re not impressed, are you?\"\"Look,\" said Trevize. \"We have worlds that are colder than averageand worlds that are warmer; worlds that are tropical forests to a largeextent, and worlds that are vast savannahs. No two worlds are alike,and every one of them is home to those who are used to it. I am used tothe relative mildness of Terminus we\u0027ve tamed it to an almost Gaianmoderation, actually but I like to get away, at least temporarily,to something different. What we have, Bliss, that Gaia doesn\u0027t have,is variation. If Gaia expands into Galaxia, will every world in theGalaxy be forced into mildness? The sameness would be unbearable.\"Bliss said, \"If that is so, and if variety seems desirable, varietywill be maintained.\"\"As a gift from the central committee, so to speak?\" said Trevizedryly. \"And as little of it as they can bear to part with? I\u0027d ratherleave it to nature.\"\"But you haven\u0027t left it to nature. Every habitable worldin the Galaxy has been modified. Every single one was found in a stateof nature that was uncomfortable for humanity, and every single one wasmodified until it was as mild as could be managed. If this world hereis cold, I am certain that is because its inhabitants couldn\u0027t warm itany further without unacceptable expense. And even so, the portions theyactually inhabit we can be sure are artificially warmed into mildness. Sodon\u0027t be so loftily virtuous about leaving it to nature.\"Trevize said, \"You speak for Gaia, I suppose.\"\"I always speak for Gaia. I am Gaia.\"\"Then if Gaia is so certain of its own superiority, why did you requiremy decision? Why have you not gone ahead without me?\"Bliss paused, as though to collect her thoughts. She said, \"Because itis not wise to trust one\u0027s self overmuch. We naturally see our virtueswith clearer eyes than we see our defects. We are anxious to do whatis right; not necessarily what seems right to us, but whatis right, objectively, if such a thing as objective rightexists. You seem to be the nearest approach to objective right that wecan find, so we are guided by you.\"\"So objectively right,\" said Trevize sadly, \"that I don\u0027t evenunderstand my own decision and I seek its justification.\"\"You\u0027ll find it,\" said Bliss. \\n\\n \"I hope so,\" said Trevize. \\n\\n \"Actually, old chap,\" said Pelorat, \"it seems to me that this recentexchange was won rather handily by Bliss. Why don\u0027t you recognize thefact that her arguments justify your decision that Gaia is the wave ofthe future for humanity?\"\"Because,\" said Trevize harshly, \"I did not know those argumentsat the time I made my decision. I knew none of these details aboutGaia. Something else influenced me, at least unconsciously, somethingthat doesn\u0027t depend upon Gaian detail, but must be more fundamental. Itis that which I must find out.\"Pelorat held up a placating hand. \"Don\u0027t be angry, Golan.\"\"I\u0027m not angry. I\u0027m just under rather unbearable tension. I don\u0027twant to be the focus of the Galaxy.\"Bliss said, \"I don\u0027t blame you for that, Trevize, and I\u0027m truly sorrythat your own makeup has somehow forced you into the post. Whenwill we be landing on Comporellon?\"\"In three days,\" said Trevize, \"and only after we stop at one of theentry stations in orbit about it.\"Pelorat said, \"There shouldn\u0027t be any problem with that, shouldthere?\"Trevize shrugged. \"It depends on the number of ships approachingthe world, the number of entry stations that exist, and, most of all,on the particular rules for permitting and refusing admittance. Suchrules change from time to time.\"Pelorat said indignantly, \"What do you mean refusing admittance? How can they refuse admittance to citizens of theFoundation? Isn\u0027t Comporellan part of the Foundation dominion?\"\"Well, yes and no. There\u0027s a delicate matter of legalism aboutthe point and I\u0027m not sure how Comporellon interprets it. I supposethere\u0027s a chance we\u0027ll be refused admission, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s alarge chance.\"\"And if we are refused, what do we do?\"\"I\u0027m not sure,\" said Trevize. \"Let\u0027s wait and see what happens beforewe wear ourselves out making contingency plans.\"11They were close enough to Comporellon now for it toappear as a substantial globe without telescopic enlargement. When suchenlargement was added, however, the entry stations themselves could beseen. They were farther out than most of the orbiting structures aboutthe planet and they were well lit. \\n\\n Approaching as the Far Star was from the direction of theplanet\u0027s southern pole, half its globe was sunlit constantly. The entrystations on its night side were naturally more clearly seen as sparksof light. They were evenly spaced in an arc about the planet. Six ofthem were visible (plus six on the day side undoubtedly) and all werecircling the planet at even and identical speeds. \\n\\n Pelorat, a little awed at the sight, said, \"There are other lightscloser to the planet. What are they?\"Trevize said, \"I don\u0027t know the planet in detail so I can\u0027t tellyou. Some might be orbiting factories or laboratories or observatories,or even populated townships. Some planets prefer to keep all orbitingobjects outwardly dark, except for the entry stations. Terminus does,for instance. Comporellon conducts itself on a more liberal principle,obviously.\"\"Which entry station do we go to, Golan?\"\"It depends on them. I\u0027ve sent in my request to land on Comporellonand we\u0027ll eventually get our directions as to which entry station to goto, and when. Much depends on how many incoming ships are trying to makeentry at present. If there are a dozen ships lined up at each station,we will have no choice but to be patient.\"Bliss said, \"I\u0027ve only been at hyperspatial distances from Gaia twicebefore, and those were both when I was at or near Sayshell. I\u0027ve neverbeen at anything like this distance.\"Trevize looked at her sharply. \"Does it matter? You\u0027re still Gaia,aren\u0027t you?\"For a moment, Bliss looked irritated, but then dissolved into whatwas almost an embarrassed titter. \"I must admit you\u0027ve caught me thistime, Trevize. There is a double meaning in the word `Gaia.\u0027 It canbe used to refer to the physical planet as a solid globular object inspace. It can also be used to refer to the living object that includesthat globe. Properly speaking, we should use two different words for thesetwo different concepts, but Gaians always know from the context what isbeing referred to. I admit that an Isolate might be puzzled at times.\"\"Well, then,\" said Trevize, \"admitting that you are many thousands ofparsecs from Gaia as globe, are you still part of Gaia as organism?\"\"Referring to the organism, I am still Gaia.\"\"No attenuation?\"\"Not in essence. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve already told you there is some addedcomplexity in remaining Gaia across hyperspace, but I remain Gaia.\"Trevize said, \"Does it occur to you that Gaia may be viewed as aGalactic kraken the tentacled monster of the legends withits tentacles reaching everywhere. You have but to put a few Gaians oneach of the populated worlds and you will virtually have Galaxia rightthere. In fact. you have probably done exactly that. Where are yourGaians located? I presume that one or more are on Terminus and one ormore are on Trantor. How much farther does this go?\"Bliss looked distinctly uncomfortable. \"I have said I won\u0027t lie toyou, Trevize, but that doesn\u0027t mean I feel compelled to give you thewhole truth. There are some things you have no need to know, and theposition and identity of individual bits of Gaia are among them.\"\"Do I need to know the reason for the existence of those tentacles,Bliss, even if I don\u0027t know where they are?\"\"It is the opinion of Gaia that you do not.\"\"I presume, though, that I may guess. You believe you serve as theguardians of the Galaxy.\"\"We are anxious to have a stable and secure Galaxy; a peaceful andprosperous one. The Seldon Plan, as originally worked out by Hari Seldonat least, is designed to develop a Second Galactic Empire, one thatis more stable and more workable than the First was. The Plan, whichhas been continually modified and improved by the Second Foundation,has appeared to be working well so far.\"\"But Gaia doesn\u0027t want a Second Galactic Empire in the classic sense,does it? You want Galaxia a living Galaxy.\"\"Since you permit it, we hope, in time, to have Galaxia. If you hadnot permitted it, we would have striven for Seldon\u0027s Second Empire andmade it as secure as we could.\"\"But what is wrong with \"His ear caught the soft, burring signal. Trevize said, \"The computeris signaling me. I suppose it is receiving directions concerning theentry station. I\u0027ll be back.\"He stepped into the pilot-room and placed his hands on those markedout on the desk top and found that there were directions forthe specific entry station he was to approach its co-ordinateswith reference to the line from Comporellon\u0027s center to its northpole the prescribed route of approach. \\n\\n Trevize signaled his acceptance, and then sat back for a moment. \\n\\n The Seldon Plan! He had not thought of it for quite a time. The FireGalactic Empire had crumbled and for five hundred years the Foundationhad grown, first in competition with that Empire, and then upon itsruins all in accordance with the Plan. \\n\\n There had been the interruption of the Mule, which, for a time, hadthreatened to shiver the Plan into fragments, but the Foundation hadpulled through probably with the help of the ever-hidden SecondFoundation possibly with the help of the even-better-hiddenGaia. \\n\\n Now the Plan was threatened by something more serious than the Mule hadever been. It was to be diverted from a renewal of Empire to somethingutterly different from anything in history Galaxia. And hehimself had agreed to that. But why? Was there a flaw in the Plan? A basic flaw? \\n\\n For one flashing moment, it seemed to Trevize that this flaw did indeedexist and that he knew what it was, that he had known what it was whenhe made his decision but the knowledge if that were what itwas vanished as fast as it came, and it left him with nothing. \\n\\n Perhaps it was all only an illusion; both when he had made hisdecision, and now. After all, he knew nothing about the Plan beyond thebasic assumptions that validated psychohistory. Apart from that, he knewno detail, and certainly not a single scrap of its mathematics. \\n\\n He closed his eyes and thought There was nothing. \\n\\n Might it be the added power he received from the computer? He placedhis hands on the desk top and felt the warmth of the computer\u0027s handsembracing them. He closed his eyes and once more he thought There was still nothing. \\n\\n 12The Comporellian who boarded the ship wore a holographic identitycard. It displayed his chubby, lightly bearded face with remarkablefidelity, and underneath it was his name, A. Kendray. \\n\\n He was rather short, and his body was as softly rounded as his facewas. He had a fresh and easygoing look and manner, and he stared aboutthe ship with clear amazement. \\n\\n He said, \"How did you get down this fast? We weren\u0027t expecting youfor two hours.\"\"It\u0027s a new-model ship,\" said Trevize, with noncommittalpoliteness. \\n\\n Kendray was not quite the young innocent he looked, however. Hestepped into the pilot-room and said at once, \"Gravitic?\"Trevize saw no point in denying anything that was apparently thatobvious. He said tonelessly, \"Yes.\"\"Very interesting. You hear of them, but you never see themsomehow. Motors in the hull?\"\"That\u0027s so.\"Kendray looked at the computer. \"Computer circuits, likewise?\"\"That\u0027s so. Anyway, I\u0027m told so. I\u0027ve never looked.\"\"Oh well. What I need is the ship\u0027s documentation; engine number,place of manufacture, identification code, the whole patty-cake. It\u0027sall in the computer, I\u0027m sure, and it can probably turn out the formalcard I need in half a second.\"It took very little more than that. Kendray looked about again. \"Youthree all the people on board?\"Trevize said, \"That\u0027s right.\"\"Any live animals? Plants? State of health?\"\"No. No. And good,\" said Trevize crisply. \\n\\n \"Um!\" said Kendray, making notes. \"Could you put your hand inhere? Just routine. Right hand, please.\"Trevize looked at the device without favor. It was being used more andmore commonly, and was growing quickly more elaborate. You could almosttell the backwardness of a world at a glance by the backwardness of itsmicrodetector. There were now few worlds, however backward, that didn\u0027thave one at all. The start had come with the final breakup of the Empire,as each fragment of the whole grew increasingly anxious to protect itselffrom the diseases and alien microorganisms of all the others. \\n\\n \"What is that?\" asked Bliss, in a low and interested voice, craningher head to see it first on one side, then the other. \\n\\n Pelorat said, \"A microdetector, I believe they call it.\"Trevize added, \"It\u0027s nothing mysterious. It\u0027s a device thatautomatically checks a portion of your body, inside and out, for anymicroorganism capable of transmitting disease.\"\"This will classify the microorganisms, too,\" said Kendray, withrather more than a hint of pride. \"It\u0027s been worked out right hereon Comporellon. And if you don\u0027t mind, I still want your righthand.\"Trevize inserted his right hand, and watched as a series of smallred markings danced along a set of horizontal lines. Kendray touched acontact and a facsimile in color appeared at once. \"If you\u0027ll sign that,sir,\" he said. \\n\\n Trevize did so. \"How badly off am I?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m not in any greatdanger, am I?\"Kendray said, \"I\u0027m not a physician, so I can\u0027t say in detail, but itshows none of the marks that would require you to be turned away or tobe put in quarantine. That\u0027s all I\u0027m interested in.\"\"What a lucky break for me,\" said Trevize dryly, shaking his hand torid himself of the slight tingle he felt. \\n\\n \"You, sir,\" said Kendray. \\n\\n Pelorat inserted his hand with a certain hesitancy, then signed thefacsimile. \\n\\n \"And you, ma\u0027am?\"A few moments later, Kendray was staring at the result, saying,\"I never saw anything like this before.\" He looked up at Bliss with anexpression of awe. \"You\u0027re negative. Altogether.\u0027\"Bliss smiled engagingly. \"How nice.\"\"Yes, ma\u0027am. I envy you.\" He looked back at the first facsimile,and said, \"Your identification, Mr. Trevize.\"Trevize presented it. Kendray, glancing at it, again looked up insurprise. \"Councilman of the Terminus Legislature?\"\"That\u0027s right.\"\"High official of the Foundation?\"Trevize said coolly, \"Exactly right. So let\u0027s get through with thisquickly, shall we?\"\"You\u0027re captain of the ship?\"\"Yes, I am.\"\"Purpose of visit?\"\"Foundation security, and that\u0027s all the answer I\u0027m going to giveyou. Do you understand that?\"\"Yes, sir. How long do you intend to stay?\"\"I don\u0027t know. Perhaps a week.\"\"Very well, sir. And this other gentleman?\"\"He is Dr. Janov Pelorat,\" said Trevize. \"You have his signature thereand I vouch for him. He is a scholar of Terminus and he is my assistantin this business of my visit.\"\"I understand, sir, but I must see his identification. Rules are rules,I\u0027m afraid. I hope you understand, sir.\"Pelorat presented his papers. \\n\\n Kendray nodded. \"And you, miss?\"Trevize said quietly, \"No need to bother the lady. I vouch for her,too.\"\"Yes, sir. But I need the identification.\"Bliss said, \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t have any papers, sir.\"Kendray frowned. \"I beg your pardon.\"Trevize said, \"The young lady didn\u0027t bring any with her. Anoversight. It\u0027s perfectly all right. I\u0027ll take full responsibility.\"Kendray said, \"I wish I could let you do that, but I\u0027m not allowed. Theresponsibility is mine. Under the circumstances, it\u0027s not terriblyimportant. There should be no difficulty getting duplicates. The youngwoman, I presume, is from Terminus.\"\"No, she\u0027s not.\"\"From somewhere in Foundation territory, then?\"\"As a matter of fact, she isn\u0027t.\"Kendray looked at Bliss keenly, then at Trevize. \"That\u0027s acomplication, Councilman. It may take additional time to obtain aduplicate from some non-Foundation world. Since you\u0027re not a Foundationcitizen, Miss Bliss, I must have the name of your world of birth andof the world of which you\u0027re a citizen. You will then have to wait forduplicate papers to arrive.\"Trevize said, \"See here, Mr. Kendray. I see no reason why there needbe any delay whatever. I am a high official of the Foundation governmentand I am here on a mission of great importance. I must not be delayedby a matter of trivial paperwork.\"\"The choice isn\u0027t mine, Councilman. If it were up to me, I\u0027d let youdown to Comporellon right now, but I have a thick book of rules thatguides my every action. I\u0027ve got to go by the book or I get it thrown atme. Of course, I presume there must be some Comporellian governmentfigure who\u0027s waiting for you. If you\u0027ll tell me who it is, I will contacthim, and if he orders me to let you through, then that\u0027s it.\"Trevize hesitated a moment. \"That would not be politic,Mr. Kendray. May I speak with your immediate superior?\"\"You certainly may, but you can\u0027t just see him off-hand \"\"I\u0027m sure he will come at once when he understands he\u0027s speaking toa Foundation official \"\"Actually,\" said Kendray, \"just between us, that would make mattersworse. We\u0027re not part of the Foundation metropolitan territory,you know. We come under the heading of an Associated Power, andwe take it seriously. The people are anxious not to appear to beFoundation puppets I\u0027m using the popular expression only, youunderstand and they bend backward to demonstrate independence. Mysuperior would expect to get extra points if he resists doing a special favor for a Foundation official.\"Trevize\u0027s expression darkened. \"And you, too?\"Kendray shook his head. \"I\u0027m below politics, sir. No one gives meextra points for anything. I\u0027m just lucky if they pay my salary. Andthough I don\u0027t get extra points, I can get demerits, and quite easily,too. I wish that were not so.\"\"Considering my position, you know, I can take care of you.\"\"No, sir. I\u0027m sorry if that sounds impertinent, but I don\u0027t thinkyou can. And, sir, it\u0027s embarrassing to say this, but please don\u0027toffer me anything valuable. They make examples of officials who acceptsuch things and they\u0027re pretty good at digging them out, these days.\"\"I wasn\u0027t thinking of bribing you. I\u0027m only thinking of what theMayor of Terminus can do to you if you interfere with my mission.\"\"Councilman, I\u0027ll be perfectly safe as long as I can hide behind therulebook. If the members of the Comporellian Presidium get some sort ofFoundation discipline, that is their concern, and not mine. But ifit will help, sir, I can let you and Dr. Pelorat through on your ship. Ifyou\u0027ll leave Miss Bliss behind at the entry station, we\u0027ll hold her fora time and send her down to the surface as soon as her duplicate paperscome through. If her papers should not be obtainable, for any reason,we will send her back to her world on commercial transportation. I\u0027mafraid, though, that someone will have to pay her fare, in that case.\"Trevize caught Pelorat\u0027s expression at that, and said, \"Mr. Kendray,may I speak to you privately in the pilot-room?\"\"Very well, but I can\u0027t remain on board very much longer, or I\u0027llbe questioned.\"\"This won\u0027t take long,\" said Trevize. \\n\\n In the pilot-room, Trevize made a show of closing the door tightly,then said, in a low voice, \"I\u0027ve been many places, Mr. Kendray, butI\u0027ve never been anyplace where there has been such harsh emphasis onthe minutiae of the rules of immigration, particularly for Foundationpeople and Foundation officials .\"\"But the young woman is not from the Foundation.\"\"Even so.\"Kendray said, \"These things go in rhythms. We\u0027ve had some scandalsand, right now, things are tough. If you\u0027ll come back next year, youmight not have any trouble at all, but right now, I can do nothing.\"\"Try, Mr. Kendray,\" said Trevize, his voice growing mellow. \"I\u0027m goingto throw myself on your mercy and appeal to you, man to man. Peloratand I have been on this mission for quite a while. He and I. Just heand I. We\u0027re good friends, but there\u0027s something lonely about it, if youget me. Some time ago, Pelorat found this little lady. I don\u0027t have totell you what happened, but we decided to bring her along. It keeps ushealthy to make use of her now and then. \\n\\n \"Now the thing is Pelorat\u0027s got a relationship back on Terminus. I\u0027mclear, you understand, but Pelorat is an older man and he\u0027s got to theage when they get a little desperate. They need their youth back,or something. He can\u0027t give her up. At the same time, if she\u0027s evenmentioned, officially, there\u0027s going to be misery galore on Terminusfor old Pelorat when he gets back. \\n\\n \"There\u0027s no harm being done, you understand. Miss Bliss, as she callsherself a good name considering her profession is not exactlya bright kid; that\u0027s not what we want her for. Do you have to mentionher at all? Can\u0027t you just list me and Pelorat on the ship? Only wewere originally listed when we left Terminus. There need be no officialnotice of the woman. After all, she\u0027s absolutely free of disease. Younoted that yourself.\"Kendray made a face. \"I don\u0027t really want to inconvenience you. Iunderstand the situation and, believe me, I sympathize. Listen,if you think holding down a shift on this station for months at atime is any fun, think again. And it isn\u0027t co-educational, either;not on Comporellon.\" He shook his head. \"And I have a wife, too, so Iunderstand. But, look, even if I let you through, as soon as theyfind out that the uh lady is without papers, she\u0027s in prison,you and Mr. Pelorat are in the kind of trouble that will get back toTerminus. And I myself will surely be out of a job.\"\"Mr. Kendray,\" said Trevize, \"trust me in this. Once I\u0027m onComporellon, I\u0027ll be safe. I can talk about my mission to some of theright people and, when that\u0027s done, there\u0027ll be no further trouble. I\u0027lltake full responsibility for what has happened here, if it ever comesup which I doubt. What\u0027s more, I will recommend your promotion,and you will get it, because I\u0027ll see to it that Terminus leans all overanyone who hesitates. And we can give Pelorat a break.\"Kendray hesitated, then said, \"All right. I\u0027ll let youthrough but take a word of warning. I start from this minutefiguring out a way to save my butt if the matter comes up. I don\u0027t intendto do one thing to save yours. What\u0027s more I know how these things workon Comporellon and you don\u0027t, and Comporellon isn\u0027t an easy world forpeople who step out of line.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Kendray,\" said Trevize. \"There\u0027ll be no trouble. Iassure you of that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630/48228.html","bookId":5,"book":{"id":5,"title":"基地系列 Foundation and Earth 基地与地球","description":"简介： 基地纪元498年。银河未来的命运决定于某人一念之间，这个就是葛兰崔维兹。他必须在第一基地，第二基地与盖娅之间做出银河未来由谁主导的决定：由第一基地创建的新帝国将会逞领银河进入科技昌明的世纪，却会像第一帝国那样摧毁在战争之中；由第二基地指导的新帝国将能确...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201608/24/13-41-46-87-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
