{"id":150,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 17: New Earth","content":"74\"Four planets,\" muttered Trevize. \"All are small,plus a trailing off of asteroids. No gas giants.\"Pelorat said, \"Do you find that disappointing?\"\"Not really. It\u0027s expected. Binaries that circle each other at smalldistances can have no planets circling one of the stars. Planets cancircle the center of gravity of both, but it\u0027s very unlikely that theywould be habitable too far away. \\n\\n \"On the other hand if the binaries are reasonably separate, there canbe planets in stable orbits about each, if they are close enough to oneor the other of the stars. These two stars, according to the computer\u0027sdata bank, have an average separation of 3.5 billion kilometers and evenat periastron, when they are closest together, are about 1.7 billionkilometers apart. A planet in an orbit of less than 200 million kilometersfrom either star would be stably situated, but there can be no planetwith a larger orbit. That means no gas giants since they would haveto be farther away from a star, but what\u0027s the difference? Gas giantsaren\u0027t habitable, anyway.\"\"But one of those four planets might be habitable.\"\"Actually the second planet is the only real possibility. For onething, it\u0027s the only one of them large enough to have an atmosphere.\"They approached the second planet rapidly and over a period of two daysits image expanded; at first with a majestic and measured swelling. Andthen, when there was no sign of any ship emerging to intercept them,with increasing and almost frightening speed. \\n\\n The Far Star was moving swiftly along a temporary orbit athousand kilometers above the cloud cover, when Trevize said grimly,\"I see why the computer\u0027s memory banks put a question mark after thenotation that it was inhabited. There\u0027s no clear sign of radiation;either light in the night-hemisphere, or radio anywhere.\"\"The cloud cover seems pretty thick,\" said Pelorat. \\n\\n \"That should not blank out radio radiation.\"They watched the planet wheeling below them, a symphony in swirlingwhite clouds, through occasional gaps of which a bluish wash indicatedocean. \\n\\n Trevize said, \"The cloud level is fairly heavy for an inhabitedworld. It might be a rather gloomy one. What bothers me most,\"he added, as they plunged once more into the night-shadow, \"is that nospace stations have hailed us.\"\"The way they did back at Comporellon, you mean?\" said Pelorat. \\n\\n \"The way they would in any inhabited world. We would have to stopfor the usual checkup on papers, freight, length of stay, and so on.\"Bliss said, \"Perhaps we missed the hail for some reason.\"\"Our computer would have received it at any wavelength they mighthave cared to use. And we\u0027ve been sending out our own signals, but haveroused no one and nothing as a result. Dipping under the cloud layerwithout communicating with station officials violates space courtesy,but I don\u0027t see that we have a choice.\"The Far Star slowed, and strengthened its antigravityaccordingly, so as to maintain its height. It came out into thesunlight again, and slowed further. Trevize, in co-ordination with thecomputer, found a sizable break in the clouds. The ship sank and passedthrough it. Beneath them heaved the ocean in what must have been a freshbreeze. It lay, wrinkled, several kilometers below, them, faintly stripedin lines of froth. \\n\\n They flew out of the sunlit patch and under the cloud cover. Theexpanse of water immediately beneath them turned a slate-gray, and thetemperature dropped noticeably. \\n\\n Fallom, staring at the viewscreen, spoke in her own consonant-richlanguage for a few moments, then shifted to Galactic. Her voicetrembled. \"What is that which I see beneath?\"\"That is an ocean,\" said Bliss soothingly. \"It is a very large massof water.\"\"Why does it not dry up?\"Bliss looked at Trevize, who said, \"There\u0027s too much water for it todry up.\"Fallom said in a half-choked manner, \"I don\u0027t want all that water. Letus go away.\" And then she shrieked, thinly, as the Far Star movedthrough a patch of storm clouds so that the viewscreen turned milky andwas streaked with the mark of raindrops. \\n\\n The lights in the pilot-room dimmed and the ship\u0027s motion becameslightly jerky. \\n\\n Trevize looked up in surprise and cried out. \"Bliss, your Fallom isold enough to transduce. She\u0027s using electric power to try to manipulatethe controls. Stop her!\"Bliss put her arms about Fallom, and hugged her tightly, \"It\u0027s allright, Fallom, it\u0027s all right. There\u0027s nothing to be afraid of. It\u0027sjust another world, that\u0027s all. There are many like this.\"Fallom relaxed somewhat but continued to tremble. \\n\\n Bliss said to Trevize, \"The child has never seen an ocean, andperhaps, for all I know, never experienced fog or rain. Can\u0027t you besympathetic?\"\"Not if she tampers with the ship. She\u0027s a danger to all of us,then. Take her into your room and calm her down.\"Bliss nodded curtly. \\n\\n Pelorat said, \"I\u0027ll come with you, Bliss.\"\"No, no, Pel,\" she responded. \"You stay here. I\u0027ll soothe Fallom andyou soothe Trevize.\" And she left. \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need soothing,\" growled Trevize to Pelorat. \"I\u0027m sorry if Iflew off the handle, but we can\u0027t have a child playing with the controls,can we?\"\"Of course we can\u0027t,\" said Pelorat, \"but Bliss was caught bysurprise. She can control Fallom, who is really remarkably well behavedfor a child taken from her home and her her robot, and thrown,willy-nilly, into a life she doesn\u0027t understand.\"\"I know. It wasn\u0027t I who wanted to take her along, remember. It wasBliss\u0027s idea.\"\"Yes, but the child would have been killed, if we hadn\u0027t takenher.\"\"Well, I\u0027ll apologize to Bliss later on. To the child, too.\"But he was still frowning, and Pelorat said gently, \"Golan, old chap,is there anything else bothering you?\"\"The ocean,\" said Trevize. They had long emerged from the rain storm,but the clouds persisted. \\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with it?\" asked Pelorat. \\n\\n \"There\u0027s too much of it, that\u0027s all.\"Pelorat looked blank, and Trevize said, with a snap, \"No land. Wehaven\u0027t seen any land. The atmosphere is perfectly normal, oxygen andnitrogen in decent proportions, so the planet has to be engineered,and there has to be plant life to maintain the oxygen level. In thenatural state, such atmospheres do not occur except, presumably,on Earth, where it developed, who knows how. But, then, on engineeredplanets there are always reasonable amounts of dry land, up to one thirdof the whole, and never less than a fifth. So how can this planet beengineered, and lack land?\"Pelorat said, \"Perhaps, since this planet is part of a binarysystem, it is completely atypical. Maybe it wasn\u0027t engineered, butevolved an atmosphere in ways that never prevail on planets about singlestars. Perhaps life developed independently here, as it once did on Earth,but only sea life.\"\"Even if we were to admit that,\" said Trevize, \"it would do us nogood. There\u0027s no way life in the sea can develop a technology. Technologyis always based on fire, and fire is impossible in the sea. A life-bearingplanet without technology is not what we\u0027re looking for.\"\"I realize that, but I\u0027m only considering ideas. After all, as far aswe know, technology only developed once on Earth. Everywhere else,the Settlers brought it with them. You can\u0027t say technology is `always\u0027 \\n\\n anything, if you only have one case to study.\"\"Travel through the sea requires streamlining. Sea life cannot haveirregular outlines and appendages such as hands.\"\"Squids have tentacles.\"Trevize said, \"I admit we are allowed to speculate, but if you\u0027rethinking of intelligent squid-like creatures evolving independentlysomewhere in the Galaxy, and developing a technology not based on fire,you\u0027re supposing something not at all likely, in my opinion.\"\"In your opinion ,\" said Pelorat gently. \\n\\n Suddenly, Trevize laughed. \"Very well, Janov. I see you\u0027relogic-chopping in order to get even with me for speaking harshly toBliss, and you\u0027re doing a good job. I promise you that if we find noland, we will examine the sea as best we can to see if we can find yourcivilized squids.\"As he spoke, the ship plunged into the night-shadow again, and theviewscreen turned black. \\n\\n Pelorat winced. \"I keep wondering,\" he said. \"Is this safe?\"\"Is what safe, Janov?\"\"Racing through the dark like this. We might dip, and dive into theocean, and be destroyed instantly.\"\"Quite impossible, Janov. Really! The computer keeps us travelingalong a gravitational line of force. In other words, it remains alwaysat a constant intensity of the planetary gravitational force which meansit keeps us at a nearly constant height above sea level.\"\"But how high?\"\"Nearly five kilometers.\"\"That doesn\u0027t really console me, Golan. Might we not reach land andsmash into a mountain we don\u0027t see?\"\" We don\u0027t see, but ship\u0027s radar will see it, and thecomputer will guide the ship around or over the mountain.\"\"What if there\u0027s level land, then? We\u0027ll miss it in the dark.\"\"No, Janov, we won\u0027t. Radar reflected from water is not at all likeradar reflected from land. Water is essentially flat; land is rough. Forthat reason, reflection from land is substantially more chaotic thanreflection from water. The computer will know the difference and it willlet me know if there\u0027s land in view. Even if it were day and the planetwere sun-lit, the computer might well detect land before I would.\"They fell silent and, in a couple of hours, they were back indaylight, with an empty ocean again rolling beneath them monotonously,but occasionally invisible when they passed through one of the numerousstorms. In one storm, the wind drove the Far Star out of itspath. The computer gave way, Trevize explained, in order to preventan unnecessary waste of energy and to minimize the chance of physicaldamage. Then, when the turbulence had passed, the computer eased theship back into its path. \\n\\n \"Probably the edge of a hurricane,\" said Trevize. \\n\\n Pelorat said, \"See here, old chap, we\u0027re just traveling west toeast or east to west. All we\u0027re examining is the equator.\"Trevize said, \"That would be foolish, wouldn\u0027t it? We\u0027re followinga great-circle route northwest-southeast. That takes us through thetropics and both temperate zones and each time we repeat the circle, thepath moves westward, as the planet rotates on its axis beneath us. We\u0027remethodically criss-crossing the world. By now, since we haven\u0027t hit land,the chances of a sizable continent are less than one in ten, accordingto the computer, and of a sizable island less than one in four, withthe chances going down each circle we make.\"\"You know what I would have done,\" said Pelorat slowly, as the nighthemisphere engulfed them again. \"I\u0027d have stayed well away from theplanet and swept the entire hemisphere facing me with radar. The cloudswouldn\u0027t have mattered, would they?\"Trevize said, \"And then zoom to the other side and do the samethere. Or just let the planet turn once. That\u0027s hindsight,Janov. Who would expect to approach a habitable planet without stoppingat a station and being given a path or being excluded? And if onewent under the cloud layer without stopping at a station, who would expectnot to find land almost at once? Habitable planets are land!\"\"Surely not all land,\" said Pelorat. \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not talking about that,\" said Trevize, in sudden excitement. \"I\u0027msaying we\u0027ve found land! Quiet!\"Then, with a restraint that did not succeed in hiding his excitement,Trevize placed his hands on the desk and became part of the computer. Hesaid, \"It\u0027s an island about two hundred and fifty kilometers long andsixty-five kilometers wide, more or less. Perhaps fifteen thousand squarekilometers in area or thereabout. Not large, but respectable. More thana dot on the map. Wait \"The lights in the pilot-room dimmed and went out. \\n\\n \"What are we doing?\" said Pelorat, automatically whispering as thoughdarkness were something fragile that must not be shattered. \\n\\n \"Waiting for our eyes to undergo dark-adaptation. The ship is hoveringover the island. Just watch. Do you see anything?\"\"No Little specks of light, maybe. I\u0027m not sure.\"\"I see them, too. Now I\u0027ll throw in the telescopic lens.\"And there was light! Clearly visible. Irregular patches of it. \\n\\n \"It\u0027s inhabited,\" said Trevize. \"It may be the only inhabited portionof the planet.\"\"What do we do?\"\"We wait for daytime. That gives us a few hours in which we canrest.\"\"Might they not attack us?\"\"With what? I detect almost no radiation except visible light andinfrared. It\u0027s inhabited and the inhabitants are clearly intelligent. Theyhave a technology, but obviously a preelectronic one, so I don\u0027t thinkthere\u0027s anything to worry about up here. If I should be wrong, thecomputer will warn me in plenty of time.\"\"And once daylight comes?\"\"We\u0027ll land, of course.\"75They came down when the first rays of the morning sunshone through a break in the clouds to reveal part of the island-freshlygreen, with its interior marked by a line of low, rolling hills stretchinginto the purplish distance. \\n\\n As they dropped closer, they could see isolated copses of treesand occasional orchards, but for the most part there weeeeeell-keptfarms. Immediately below them, on the southeastern shore of the islandwas a silvery beach backed by a broken line of boulders, and beyond itwas a stretch of lawn. They caught a glimpse of an occasional house,but these did not cluster into anything like a town. \\n\\n Eventually, they made out a dim network of roads, sparsely lined bydwelling places, and then, in the cool morning air, they spied an air-carin the far distance. They could only tell it was an air-car, and nota bird, by the manner of its maneuvering. It was the first indubitablesign of intelligent life in action they had yet seen on the planet. \\n\\n \"It could be an automated vehicle, if they could manage that withoutelectronics,\" said Trevize. \\n\\n Bliss said, \"It might well be. It seems to me that if there were ahuman being at the controls, it would be heading for us. We must be quitea sight a vehicle sinking downward without the use of braking jetsof rocket fire.\"\"A strange sight on any planet,\" said Trevize thoughtfully. \"Therecan\u0027t be many worlds that have ever witnessed the descent of a graviticspace-vessel. The beach would make a fine landing place, but ifthe winds blow I don\u0027t want the ship inundated. I\u0027ll make for the stretchof grass on the other side of the boulders.\"\"At least,\" said Pelorat, \"a gravitic ship won\u0027t scorch privateproperty in descending.\"Down they came gently on the four broad pads that had moved slowlyoutward during the last stage. These pressed down into the soil underweight of the ship. \\n\\n Pelorat said, \"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ll leave marks, though.\"\"At least,\" said Bliss, and there was that in her voice that was noten approving, \"the climate is evidently equable I would even say,warm.\"A human being was on the grass, watching the ship descend and showingno evidence of fear or surprise. The look on her face showed only raptinterest. \\n\\n She wore very little, which accounted for Bliss\u0027s estimate of theclimate. Her sandals seemed to be of canvas, and about her hips was awraparound skirt with a flowered pattern. There were no leg-coveringsand there was nothing above her waist. \\n\\n Her hair was black, long, and very glossy, descending almost to herwaist; Her skin color was a pale brown and her eyes were narrow. \\n\\n Trevize scanned the surroundings and there was no other human being insight. He shrugged and said, \"Well, it\u0027s early morning and the inhabitantsmay be mostly indoors, or even asleep. Still, I wouldn\u0027t say it was awell-populated area.\"He turned to the others and said, \"I\u0027ll go out and talk to the woman,if she, speaks anything comprehensible. The rest of you \"\"I should think,\" said Bliss firmly, \"that we might as well allstep out. That woman looks completely harmless and, in any case, I wantto stretch my legs and breathe planetary air, and perhaps arrange forplanetary food. I want Fallom to get the feel of a world again, too,and I think Pel would like to examine the woman at closer range.\"\"Who? I?\" said Pelorat, turning faintly pink. \"Not at all, Bliss,but I am the linguist of our little party.\"Trevize shrugged. \"Come one, come all. Still, though she may lookharmless, I intend to take my weapons with me.\"\"I doubt,\" said Bliss, \"that you will be much tempted to use them onthat young woman.\"Trevize grinned. \"She is attractive, isn\u0027t she?\"Trevize left the ship first, then Bliss, with one hand swung backwardto enclose Fallom\u0027s, who carefully made her way down the ramp afterBliss. Pelorat was last. \\n\\n The black-haired young woman continued to watch with interest. Shedid not back away an inch. \\n\\n Trevize muttered, \"Well, let\u0027s try.\"He held his arms away from his weapons and said, \"I greet you.\"The young woman considered that for a moment, and said, \"I greet theeand I greet thy companions.\"Pelorat said joyfully, \"How wonderful! She speaks Classical Galacticand with a correct accent.\u0027\"\"I understand her, too,\" said Trevize, oscillating one hand to indicatehis understanding wasn\u0027t perfect. \"I hope she understands me.\"He said, smiling, and assuming a friendly expression, \"We come fromacross space. We come from another world.\"\"That is well,\" said the young woman, in her clear soprano. \"Comesthy ship from the Empire?\"\"It comes from a far star, and the ship is named Far Star .\"The young woman looked up at the lettering on the ship. \"Is thatwhat that sayeth? If that be so, and if the first letter is an F, then,behold, it is imprinted backward.\"Trevize was about to object, but Pelorat, in an ecstasy of joy, said,\"She\u0027s right. The letter F did reverse itself about two thousand yearsago. What a marvelous chance to study Classical Galactic in detail andas a living language.\"Trevize studied the young woman carefully. She was not much more than1.5 meters in height, and her breasts, though shapely, were small. Yetshe did not seem unripe. The nipples were large and the areolae dark,though that might be the result of her brownish skin color. \\n\\n He said, \"My name is Golan Trevize; my friend is Janov Pelorat;the woman is Bliss; and the child is Fallom.\"\"Is it the custom, then, on the far star from which you come, thatthe men be given a double name? I am Hiroko, daughter of Hiroko.\"\"And your father?\" interposed Pelorat suddenly. \\n\\n To which Hiroko replied with an indifferent shrug of her shoulder,\"His name, so sayeth my mother, is Smool, but it is of no importance. Iknow him not.\"\"And where are the others?\" asked Trevize. \"You seem to be the onlyone to be here to greet us.\"Hiroko said, \"Many men are aboard the fishboats; many women are in thefields. I take holiday these last two days and so am fortunate enough tosee this great thing. Yet people are curious and the ship will have beenseen as it descended, even from a distance. Others will be here soon.\"\"Are there many others on this island?\"\"There are more than a score and five thousand,\" said Hiroko withobvious pride. \\n\\n \"And are there other islands in the ocean?\"\"Other islands, good sir?\" She seemed puzzled. \\n\\n Trevize took that as answer enough. This was the one spot on theentire planet that was inhabited by human beings. \\n\\n He said, \"What do you call your world?\"\"It is Alpha, good sir. We are taught that the whole name is AlphaCentauri, if that has more meaning to thee, but we call it Alpha only and,see, it is a fair-visaged world.\"\"A what world?\" said Trevize, turning blankly toPelorat. \\n\\n \"A beautiful world, she means,\" said Pelorat. \\n\\n \"That it is,\" said Trevize, \"at least here, and at this moment.\" Helooked up at the mild blue morning sky, with its occasional drift ofclouds. \"You have a nice sunny day, Hiroko, but I imagine there aren\u0027tmany of those on Alpha.\"Hiroko stiffened. \"As many as we wish, sir. The clouds may come whenwe need rain, but on most days it seemeth good to us that the sky isfair above. Surely a goodly sky and a quiet wind are much to be desiredon those days when the fishboats are at sea.\"\"Do your people control the weather, then, Hiroko?\"\"Did we not, Sir Golan Trevize, we would be soggy with rain.\"\"But how do you do that?\"\"Not being a trained engineer, sir, I cannot tell thee.\"\"And what might be the name of this island on which you and yourpeople live?\" said Trevize, finding himself trapped in the ornatesound of Classical Galactic (and wondering desperately if he had theconjugations right). \\n\\n Hiroko said, \"We call our heavenly island in the midst of the vastsea of waters New Earth.\"At which Trevize and Pelorat stared at each other with surpriseand delight. \\n\\n 76There was no time to follow up on the statement. Otherswere arriving. Dozens. They must consist of those, Trevize thought,who were not on the ships or in the fields, and who were not from toofar away. They came on foot for the most part, though two ground-carswere in evidence rather old and clumsy. \\n\\n Clearly, this was a low-technology society, and yet they controlledthe weather. \\n\\n It was well known that technology was not necessarily all of a piece;that lack of advance in some directions did not necessarily excludeconsiderable advance in others but surely this example of unevendevelopment was unusual. \\n\\n Of those who were now watching the ship, at least half were elderlymen and women; there were also three or four children. Of the rest, morewere women than men. None showed any fear or uncertainty whatever. \\n\\n Trevize said in a low voice to Bliss, \"Are you manipulating them? Theyseem serene.\"\"I\u0027m not in the least manipulating them,\" said Bliss. \"I never touchminds unless I must. It\u0027s Fallom I\u0027m concerned with.\"Few as the newcomers were to anyone who had experienced the crowdsof curiosity-seekers on any normal world in the Galaxy, they were amob to Fallom, to whom the three adults on the Far Star hadbeen something to grow accustomed to. Fallom was breathing rapidly andshallowly, and her eyes were half-closed. Almost, she seemed in shock. \\n\\n Bliss was stroking her, softly and rhythmically, and making soothingsounds. Trevize was certain that she was delicately accompanying it allby an infinitely gentle rearrangement of mental fibrils. \\n\\n Fallom took in a sudden deep breath, almost a gasp, and shook herself,in what was perhaps an involuntary shudder. She raised her head andlooked at those present with something approaching normality and thenburied her head in the space between Bliss\u0027s arm and body. \\n\\n Bliss let her remain so, while her arm, encircling Fallom\u0027s shoulder,tightened periodically as though to indicate her own protective presenceover and over. \\n\\n Pelorat seemed rather awestruck, as his eyes went from one Alphan toanother. He said, \"Golan, they differ so among themselves.\"Trevize had noticed that, too. There were various shades of skinand hair color, including one brilliant redhead with blue eyes andfreckled skin. At least three apparent adults were as short as Hiroko,and one or two were taller than Trevize. A number of both sexes had eyesresembling those of Hiroko, and Trevize remembered that on the teemingcommercial planets of the Fili sector, such eyes were characteristic ofthe population, but he had never visited that sector. \\n\\n All the Alphans wore nothing above the waist and among the women thebreasts all seemed to be small. That was the most nearly uniform of allthe bodily characteristics that he could see. \\n\\n Bliss said suddenly, \"Miss Hiroko, my youngster is not accustomedto travel through space and she is absorbing more novelty than she caneasily manage. Would it be possible for her to sit down and, perhaps,have something to eat and drink?\"Hiroko looked puzzled, and Pelorat repeated what Bliss had said inthe more ornate Galactic of the mid-Imperial period. \\n\\n Hiroko\u0027s hand then flew to her mouth and she sank to her kneesgracefully. \"I crave your pardon, respected madam,\" she said. \"I havenot thought of this child\u0027s needs, nor of thine. The strangeness of thisevent has too occupied me. Wouldst thou would you all asvisitors and guests, enter the refectory for morning meal? May we joinyou and serve as hosts?\"Bliss said, \"That is kind of you.\" She spoke slowly and pronouncedthe words carefully, hoping to make them easier to understand. \"Itwould be better, though, if you alone served as hostess, for the sake ofthe comfort of the child who is unaccustomed to being with many peopleat once.\"Hiroko rose to her feet. \"It shall be as thou hast said.\"She led them, in leisurely manner, across the grass. Other Alphansedged closer. They seemed particularly interested in the clothing of thenewcomers. Trevize removed his light jacket, and handed it to a man whohad sidled toward him and had laid a questing finger upon it. \\n\\n \"Here,\" he said, \"look it over, but return it.\" Then he said toHiroko. \"See that I get it back, Miss Hiroko.\"\"Of a surety, it will be backhanded, respected sir.\" She nodded herhead gravely. \\n\\n Trevize smiled and walked on. He was more comfortable without thejacket in the light, mild breeze. \\n\\n He had detected no visible weapons on the persons of any of those abouthim, and he found it interesting that no one seemed to show any fear ordiscomfort over Trevize\u0027s. They did not even show curiosity concerningthem. It might well be that they were not aware of the objects as weaponsat all. From what Trevize had so far seen, Alpha might well be a worldutterly without violence. \\n\\n A woman, having moved rapidly forward, so as to be a little aheadof Bliss, turned to examine her blouse minutely, then said, \"Hast thoubreasts, respected madam?\"And, as though unable to wait for an answer, she placed her handlightly on Bliss\u0027s chest. \\n\\n Bliss smiled and said, \"As thou hast discovered, I have. They areperhaps not as shapely as thine, but I hide them not for that reason. Onmy world, it is not fitting that they be uncovered.\"She whispered in an aside to Pelorat, \"How do you like the way I\u0027mgetting the hang of Classical Galactic?\"\"You did that very well, Bliss,\" said Pelorat. \\n\\n The dining room was a large one with long tables to which wereattached long benches on either side. Clearly, the Alphans atecommunity-fashion. \\n\\n Trevize felt a pang of conscience. Bliss\u0027s request for privacy hadreserved this space for five people and forced the Alphans generallyto remain in exile outside. A number, however, placed themselves at arespectful distance from the windows (which were no more than gaps inthe wall, unfilled even by screens), presumably so that they might watchthe strangers eat. \\n\\n Involuntarily, he wondered what would happen if it were torain. Surely, the rain would come only when it was needed, light and mild,continuing without significant wind till enough had fallen. Moreover,it would always come at known times so that the Alphans would be readyfor it, Trevize imagined. \\n\\n The window he was facing looked out to sea, and far out at the horizonit seemed to Trevize that he could make out a bank of clouds similar tothose that so nearly filled the skies everywhere but over this littlespot of Eden. \\n\\n There were advantages to weather control. \\n\\n Eventually, they were served by a young woman on tiptoeing feet. Theywere not asked for their choice, but were merely served. There was a smallglass of milk, a larger of grape juice, a still larger of water. Eachdiner received two large poached eggs, with slivers of white cheeseon the side. Each also had a large platter of broiled fish and smallroasted potatoes, resting on cool, green lettuce leaves. \\n\\n Bliss looked with dismay at the quantity of food before her and wasclearly at a loss where to begin. Fallom had no such trouble. She drankthe grape juice thirstily and with clear evidence of approval, thenchewed away at the fish and potatoes. She was about to use her fingersfor the purpose, but Bliss held up a large spoon with tined ends thatcould serve as a fork as well, and Fallom accepted it. \\n\\n Pelorat smiled his satisfaction and cut into the eggs at once. \\n\\n Trevize, saying, \"Now to be reminded what real eggs taste like,\"followed suit. \\n\\n Hiroko, forgetting to eat her own breakfast in her delight at themanner in which the others ate (for even Bliss finally began, withobvious relish), said, at last, \"Is it well?\"\"It is well,\" said Trevize, his voice somewhat muffled. \"This islandhas no shortage of food, apparently. Or do you serve us more thanyou should, out of politeness?\"Hiroko listened with intent eyes, and seemed to grasp the meaning,for she said, \"No, no, respected sir. Our land is bountiful, our sea evenmore so. Our ducks give eggs, our goats both cheese and milk. And thereare our grains. Above all, our sea is filled with countless varietiesof fish in numberless quantity. The whole Empire could eat at our tablesand consume not the fish of our sea.\"Trevize smiled discreetly. Clearly, the young Alphan had not thesmallest idea of the true size of the Galaxy. \\n\\n He said, \"You call this island New Earth, Hiroko. Where, then, mightOld Earth be?\"She looked at him in bewilderment. \" Old Earth, say you? Icrave pardon, respected sir. I take not thy meaning.\"Trevize said, \"Before there was a New Earth, your people must havelived elsewhere. Where was this elsewhere from which they came?\"\"I know naught of that, respected sir,\" she said, with troubledgravity. \"This land has been mine all my life, and my mother\u0027s andgrandmother\u0027s before me; and, I doubt not, their grandmother\u0027s andgreat-grandmother\u0027s before them. Of any other land, I know naught.\"\"But,\" said Trevize, descending to gentle argumentation, \"you speakof this land as New Earth. Why do you call it that?\"\"Because, respected sir,\" she replied, equally gentle, \"that is what itis called by all since the mind of woman goeth not to the contrary.\"\"But it is New Earth, and therefore, a later Earth. Theremust be an Old Earth, a former one, for which it wasnamed. Each morning there is a new day, and that implies that earlierthere had existed an old day. Don\u0027t you see that this must be so?\"\"Nay, respected sir. I know only what this land is called. I know ofnaught else, nor do I follow this reasoning of thine which sounds verymuch like what we call here chop-logic. I mean no offense.\"And Trevize shook his head and felt defeated. \\n\\n 77Trevize leaned toward Pelorat, and whispered, \"Whereverwe go, whatever we do, we get no information.\"\"We know where Earth is, so what does it matter?\" said Pelorat,doing little more than move his lips. \\n\\n \"I want to know something about it.\"\"She\u0027s very young. Scarcely a repository of information.\"Trevize thought about that, then nodded. \"Right, Janov.\"He turned to Hiroko and said, \"Miss Hiroko, you haven\u0027t asked us whywe are here in your land?\"Hiroko\u0027s eyes fell, and she said, \"That would be but scant courtesyuntil you have all eaten and rested, respected sir.\"\"But we have eaten, or almost so, and we have recently rested, so Ishall tell you why we are here. My friend, Dr. Pelorat, is a scholaron our world, a learned man. He is a mythologist. Do you know whatthat means?\"\"Nay, respected sir, I do not.\"\"He studies old tales as they are told on different worlds. Old talesare known as myths or legends and they interest Dr. Pelorat. Are therelearned ones on New Earth who know the old tales of this world?\"Hiroko\u0027s forehead creased slightly into a frown of thought. She said,\"This is not a matter in which I am myself skilled. We have an old manin these parts who loves to talk of ancient days. Where he may havelearned these things, I know not, and methinks he may have spun hisnotions out of air, or heard them from others who did so spin. Thisis perhaps the material which thy learned companion would hear, yet Iwould not mislead thee. It is in my mind,\" she looked to right and leftas though unwilling to be overheard, \"that the old man is but a prater,though many listen willingly to him.\"Trevize nodded. \"Such prating is what we wish. Would it be possiblefor you to take my friend to this old man \"\"Monolee he calls himself.\"\" to Monolee, then. And do you think Monolee would be willingto speak to my friend?\"\"He? Willing to speak?\" said Hiroko scornfully. \"Thou must ask,rather, if he be ever ready to cease from speaking. He is but a man,and will therefore speak, if allowed, till a fortnight hence, with nopause. I mean no offense, respected sir.\"\"No offense taken. Would you lead my friend to Monolee now?\"\"That may anyone do at any time. The ancient is ever home and everready to greet an ear.\"Trevize said, \"And perhaps an older woman would be willing to comeand sit with Madam Bliss. She has the child to care for and cannot moveabout too much. It would please her to have company, for women, as youknow, are fond of \"\"Prating?\" said Hiroko, clearly amused. \"Why, so men say, althoughI have observed that men are always the greater babblers. Let the menreturn from their fishing, and one will vie with another in tellinggreater flights of fancy concerning their catches. None will mark them norbelieve, but this will not stop them, either. But enough of my prating,too. I will have a friend of my mother\u0027s, one whom I can seethrough the window, stay with Madam Bliss and the child, and before thatshe will guide your friend, the respected doctor, to the aged Monolee. Ifyour friend will hear as avidly as Monolee will prate, thou wilt scarcelypart them in this life. Wilt thou pardon my absence a moment?\"When she had left, Trevize turned to Pelorat and said, \"Listen, getwhat you can out of the old man, and Bliss, you find out what you canfrom whoever stays with you. What you want is anything about Earth.\"\"And you?\" said Bliss. \"What will you do?\"\"I will remain with Hiroko, and try to find a third source.\"Bliss smiled. \"Ah yes. Pel will be with this old man; I with an oldwoman. You will force yourself to remain with this fetchingly uncladyoung woman. It seems a reasonable division of labor.\"\"As it happens, Bliss, it is reasonable.\"\"But you don\u0027t find it depressing that the reasonable division oflabor should work out so, I suppose.\"\"No, I don\u0027t. Why should I?\"\"Why should you, indeed?\"Hiroko was back, and sat down again. \"It is all arranged. The respectedDr. Pelorat will be taken to Monolee; and the respected Madam Bliss,together with her child, will have company. May I be granted, then,respected Sir Trevize, the boon of further conversation with thee,mayhap of this Old Earth of which thou \"\"Pratest?\" asked Trevize. \\n\\n \"Nay,\" said Hiroko, laughing. \"But thou dost well to mock me. I showedthee but discourtesy ere now in answering thy question on this matter. Iwould fain make amends.\"Trevize turned to Pelorat. \"Fain?\"\"Be eager,\" said Pelorat softly. \\n\\n Trevize said, \"Miss Hiroko, I felt no discourtesy, but if it willmake you feel better, I will gladly speak with you.\"\"Kindly spoken. I thank thee,\" said Hiroko, rising. \\n\\n Trevize rose, too. \"Bliss,\" he said, \"make sure Janov remainssafe.\"\"Leave that to me. As for you, you have your \" She nodded towardhis holsters. \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll need them,\" said Trevize uncomfortably. \\n\\n He followed Hiroko out of the dining room. The sun was higher in thesky now and the temperature was still warmer. There was an otherworldlysmell as always. Trevize remembered it had been faint on Comporellon, alittle musty on Aurora, and rather delightful on Solaria. (On Melpomenia,they were in space suits where one is only aware of the smell of one\u0027sown body.) In every case, it disappeared in a matter of hours as theosmic centers of the nose grew saturated. \\n\\n Here, on Alpha, the odor was a pleasant grassy fragrance under thewarming effect of the sun, and Trevize felt a bit annoyed, knowing thatthis, too, would soon disappear. \\n\\n They were approaching a small structure that seemed to be built ofa pale pink plaster. \\n\\n \"This,\" said Hiroko, \"is my home. It used to belong to my mother\u0027syounger sister.\"She walked in and motioned Trevize to follow. The door was open or,Trevize noticed as he passed through, it would be more accurate to saythere was no door. \\n\\n Trevize said, \"What do you do when it rains?\"\"We are ready. It will rain two days hence, for three hours eredawn, when it is coolest, and when it will moisten the soil mostpowerfully. Then I have but to draw this curtain, both heavy andwater-repellent, across the door.\"She did so as she spoke. It seemed made of a strong canvas-likematerial. \\n\\n \"I will leave it in place now,\" she went on. \"All will then knowI am within but not available, for I sleep or am occupied in mattersof importance.\"\"It doesn\u0027t seem much of a guardian of privacy.\"\"Why should it not be? See, the entrance is covered.\"\"But anyone could shove it aside.\"\"With disregard of the wishes of the occupant?\" Hiroko lookedshocked. \"Are such things done on thy world? It would be barbarous.\"Trevize grinned. \"I only asked.\"She led him into the second of two rooms, and, at her invitation, heseated himself in a padded chair. There was something claustrophobic aboutthe blockish smallness and emptiness of the rooms, but the house seemeddesigned for little more than seclusion and rest. The window openingswere small and near the ceiling, but there were dull mirror strips in acareful pattern along the walls, which reflected light diffusely. Therewere slits in the Ioor from which a gentle, cool breeze uplifted. Trevizesaw no signs of artifinal lighting and wondered if Alphans had to wakeat sunrise and go to bed at sunset. \\n\\n He was about to ask, but Hiroko spoke first, saying, \"Is Madam Blissthy woman companion?\"Trevize said cautiously, \"Do you mean by that, is she my sexualpartner?\"Hiroko colored. \"I pray thee, have regard for the decencies of politeconversation, but I do mean private pleasantry.\"\"No, she is the woman companion of my learned friend.\"\"But thou art the younger, and the more goodly.\"\"Well, thank you for your opinion, but it is not Bliss\u0027s opinion. Shelikes Dr. Pelorat much more than she does me.\"\"That much surprises me. Will he not share?\"\"I have not asked him whether he would, but I\u0027m sure he wouldn\u0027t. Norwould I want him to.\"Hiroko nodded her head wisely. \"I know. It is her fundament.\"\"Her fundament?\"\"Thou knowest. This.\" And she slapped her own dainty rear end. \\n\\n \"Oh, that! I understand you. Yes, Bliss is generously proportionedin her pelvic anatomy.\" He made a curving gesture with his hands andwinked. (And Hiroko laughed.)Trevize said, \"Nevertheless, a great many men enjoy that kind ofgenerosity of figure.\"\"I cannot believe so. Surely it would be a sort of gluttony to wishexcess of that which is pleasant in moderation. Wouldst thou think moreof me if my breasts were massive and dangling, with nipples pointingto toes? I have, in good sooth, seen such, yet have I not seen menflock to them. The poor women so afflicted must needs cover theirmonstrosities as Madam Bliss does.\"\"Such oversize wouldn\u0027t attract me, either, though I am sure thatBliss doesn\u0027t cover her breasts for any imperfection they may have.\"\"Thou dost not, then, disapprove of my visage or form?\"\"I would be a madman to do so. You are beautiful.\"\"And what dost thou for pleasantries on this ship of thine, as thouflittest from one world to the next Madam Bliss being deniedthee?\"\"Nothing, Hiroko. There\u0027s nothing to do. I think of pleasantries onoccasion and that has its discomforts, but we who travel through spaceknow well that there are times when we must do without. We make up forit at other times.\"\"If it be a discomfort, how may that be removed?\"\"I experience considerably more discomfort since you\u0027ve brought upthe subject. I don\u0027t think it would be polite to suggest how I mightbe comforted.\"\"Would it be discourtesy, were I to suggest a way?\"\"It would depend entirely on the nature of the suggestion.\"\"I would suggest that we be pleasant with each other.\"\"Did you bring me here, Hiroko, that it might come to this?\"Hiroko said, with a pleased smile, \"Yes. It would be both myhostess-duty of courtesy, and it would be my wish, too.\"\"If that\u0027s the case, I will admit iiiis my wish, too. In fact,I would like very much to oblige you in this. I would be uhfain to do thee pleasure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630/48256.html","bookId":5,"book":{"id":5,"title":"基地系列 Foundation and Earth 基地与地球","description":"简介： 基地纪元498年。银河未来的命运决定于某人一念之间，这个就是葛兰崔维兹。他必须在第一基地，第二基地与盖娅之间做出银河未来由谁主导的决定：由第一基地创建的新帝国将会逞领银河进入科技昌明的世纪，却会像第一帝国那样摧毁在战争之中；由第二基地指导的新帝国将能确...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201608/24/13-41-46-87-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
