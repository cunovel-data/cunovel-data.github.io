Then he said, \"Is there somethingyou saw that I did not, and that you did not tell me about?\"\"No,\" answered Pelorat mildly. \"You saw it and, as I just said,I tried to explain, but you were in no mood to listen to me.\"\"Well, try again.\"Bliss said, \"Don\u0027t bully him, Trevize.\"\"I\u0027m not bullying him. I\u0027m asking for information. And don\u0027t youbaby him.\"\"Please,\" said Pelorat, \"listen to me, will you, and not to eachother. Do you remember, Golan, that we discussed early attemptsto discover the origin of the human species? Yariff\u0027s project? Youknow, trying to plot the times of settlement of various planets on theassumption that planets would be settled outward from the world of originin all directions alike. Then, as we moved from newer to older planets,we would approach the world of origin from all directions.\"Trevize nodded impatiently. \"What I remember is that it didn\u0027t workbecause the dates of settlement were not reliable.\"\"That\u0027s right, old fellow. But the worlds that Yariff was workingwith were part of the second expansion of the human race. By then,hyperspatial travel was far advanced, and settlement must have grown quiteragged. Leapfrogging very long distances was very simple and settlementdidn\u0027t necessarily proceed outward in radial symmetry. That surely addedto the problem of unreliable dates of settlement. \n \"But just think for a moment, Golan, of the Spacer worlds. Theywere in the first wave of settlement. Hyperspatial travel was lessadvanced then, and there was probably little or no leapfrogging. Whereasmillions of worlds were settled, perhaps chaotically, during the secondexpansion, only fifty were settled, probably in an orderly manner, inthe first. Whereas the millions of worlds of the second expansion weresettled over a period of twenty thousand years; the fifty of the firstexpansion were settled over a period of a few centuries almostinstantaneously, in comparison. Those fifty, taken together, shouldexist in roughly spherical symmetry about the world of origin. \n \"We have the co-ordinates of the fifty worlds. You photographed them,remember, from the statue. Whatever or whoever it is that is destroyinginformation that concerns Earth, either overlooked those co-ordinates, ordidn\u0027t stop to think that they would give us the information we need. Allyou have to do, Golan, is to adjust the co-ordinates to allow for thelast twenty thousand years of stellar motions, then find the center ofthe sphere. You\u0027ll end up fairly close to Earth\u0027s sun, or at least towhere it was twenty thousand years ago.\"Trevize\u0027s mouth had fallen slightly open during the recital and ittook a few moments for him to close it after Pelorat was done. He said,\"Now why didn\u0027t I think of that?\"\"I tried to tell you while we were still on Melpomenia.\"\"I\u0027m sure you did. I apologize, Janov, for refusing to listen. Thefact is it didn\u0027t occur to me that \" He paused in embarrassment. \n Pelorat chuckled quietly, \"That I could have anything of importanceto say. I suppose that ordinarily I wouldn\u0027t, but this was somethingin my own field, you see. I am sure that, as a general rule, you\u0027d beperfectly justified in not listening to me.\"\"Never,\" said Trevize. \"That\u0027s not so, Janov. I feel like a fool,and I well deserve the feeling. My apologies again and I must nowget to the computer.\"He and Pelorat walked into the pilot-room, and Pelorat, as always,watched with a combination of marveling and incredulity as Trevize\u0027shands settled down upon the desk, and he became what was almost a singleman computer organism. \n \"I\u0027ll have to make certain assumptions, Janov,\" said Trevize, ratherblankfaced from computer-absorption. \"I have to assume that the firstnumber is a distance in parsecs, and that the other two numbers are anglesin radians, the first being up and down, so to speak, and the other,right and left. I have to assume that the use of plus and minus in thecase of the angles is Galactic Standard and that the zero-zzzzzzzzz markis Melpomenia\u0027s sun.\"\"That sounds fair enough,\" said Pelorat. \n \"Does it? There are six possible ways of arranging the numbers, fourpossible ways of arranging the signs, distances may be in light-yearsrather than parsecs, the angles in degrees, rather than radians. That\u0027sninety-six diferent variations right there. Add to that, the point thatif the distances are light-years, I\u0027m uncertain as to the length of theyear used. Add also the fact that I don\u0027t know the actual conventionsused to measure the angles from the Melpomenian equator in one case,I suppose, but what\u0027s their prime meridian?\"Pelorat frowned. \"Now you make it sound hopeless.\"\"Not hopeless. Aurora and Solaria are included in the list, and Iknow where they are in space. I\u0027ll use the co-ordinates, and see ifI can locate them. If I end up in the wrong place, I will adjust theco-ordinates until they give me the right place, and that will tell mewhat mistaken assumptions I am making as far as the standards governingthe co-ordinates are concerned. Once my assumptions are corrected,I can look for the center of the sphere.\"\"With all the possibilities for change, won\u0027t it make it difficultto decide what to do?\"\"What?\" said Trevize. He was increasingly absorbed. Then, whenPelorat repeated the question, he said, \"Oh well, chances are that theco-ordinates follow the Galactic Standard and adjusting for an unknownprime meridian isn\u0027t difficult. These systems for locating points in spacewere worked out long ago, and most astronomers are pretty confident theyeven antedate interstellar travel. Human beings are very conservativein some ways and virtually never change numerical conventions once theygrow used to them. They even come to mistake them for laws of nature,I think. Which is just as well, for if every world had its ownconventions of measurement that changed every century, I honestly thinkscientific endeavor would stall and come to a permanent stop.\"He was obviously working while he was talking, for his words camehaltingly. And now he muttered, \"But quiet now.\"After that, his face grew furrowed and concentrated until, afterseveral minutes, he leaned back and drew a long breath. He said quietly,\"The conventions hold. I\u0027ve located Aurora. There\u0027s no question aboutit. See?\"Pelorat stared at the field of stars, and at the bright one near thecenter and said, \"Are you sure?\"Trevize said, \"My own opinion doesn\u0027t matter. Thecomputer is sure. We\u0027ve visited Aurora, after all. We haveits characteristics its diameter, mass, luminosity, temperature,spectral details, to say nothing of the pattern of neighboring stars. Thecomputer says it\u0027s Aurora.\"\"Then I suppose we must take its word for it.\"\"Believe me, we must. Let me adjust the viewscreen and the computercan get to work. It has the fifty sets of co-ordinates and it will usethem one at a time.\"Trevize was working on the screen as he spoke. The computer worked inthe four dimensions of space-time routinely, but, for human inspection,the viewscreen was rarely needed in more than two dimensions. Now thescreen seemed to unfold into a dark volume as deep as it, was tall andbroad. Trevize dimmed the room lights almost totally to make the viewof star-shine easier to observe. \n \"It will begin now,\" he whispered. \n A moment later, a star appeared then another thenanother. The view on the screen shifted with every addition so that allmight be included. It was as though space was moving backward from theeye so that a more and more panoramic view could be taken. Combine thatwith shifts up or down, right or left Eventually, fifty dots of light appeared, hovering in three-dimensionalspace. \n Trevize said, \"I would have appreciated a beautiful sphericalarrangement, but this looks like the skeleton of a snowball that hadbeen patted into shape in a big hurry, out of snow that was too hardand gritty.\"\"Does that ruin everything?\"\"It introduces some difficulties, but that can\u0027t be helped, Isuppose. The stars themselves aren\u0027t uniformly distributed, and certainlyhabitable planets aren\u0027t, so there are bound to be unevennesses in theestablishment of new worlds. The computer will adjust each of thosedots to its present position, allowing for its likely motion in thelast twenty thousand years even in that time it won\u0027t mean muchof an adjustment and then fit them all into a `best-sphere.\u0027 Itwill find a spherical surface, in other words, from which the distanceof all the dots is a minimum. Then we find the center of the sphere,and Earth should be fairly close to that center. Or so we hope. Itwon\u0027t take long.\"70It didn\u0027t. Trevize, who was used to accepting miraclesfrom the computer, found himself astonished at how little time ittook. \n Trevize had instructed the computer to sound a soft, reverberatingnote upon deciding upon the co-ordinates of the best-center. There wasno reason for that, except for the satisfaction of hearing it and knowingthat perhaps the search had been ended. \n The sound came in a matter of minutes, and was like the gentlestroking of a mellow gong. It swelled till they could feel the vibrationphysically, and then slowly faded. \n Bliss appeared at the door almost at once. \"What\u0027s that?\" she asked,her eyes big. \"An emergency?\"Trevize said, \"Not at all.\"Pelorat added eagerly, \"We may have located Earth, Bliss. That soundwas the computer\u0027s way of saying so.\"She walked into the room. \"I might have been warned.\"Trevize said, \"I\u0027m sorry, Bliss. I didn\u0027t mean it to be quite thatloud.\"Fallom had followed Bliss into the room and said, \"Why was there thatsound, Bliss?\"\"I see she\u0027s curious, too,\" said Trevize. He sat back, feelingdrained. The next step was to try the finding on the real Galaxy, tofocus on the coordinates of the center of the Spacer worlds and see if aG-type star was actually present. Once again, he was reluctant to takethe obvious step, unable to make himself put the possible solution tothe actual test. \n \"Yes,\" said Bliss. \"Why shouldn\u0027t she? She\u0027s as human as we are.\"\"Her parent wouldn\u0027t have thought so,\" said Trevize abstractedly. \"Iworry about the kid. She\u0027s bad news.\"\"In what way has she proven so?\" demanded Bliss. \n Trevize spread his arms. \"Just a feeling.\"Bliss gave him a disdainful look, and turned to Fallom. \"We are tryingto locate Earth, Fallom.\" ,\"What\u0027s Earth?\"\"Another world, but a special one. It\u0027s the world our ancestors camefrom. Do you know what the word `ancestors\u0027 means from your reading,Fallom?\"\"Does it mean ?\" But the last word was not inGalactic. \n Pelorat said, \"That\u0027s an archaic word for `ancestors,\u0027 Bliss. Our word`forebears\u0027 is closer to it.\"\"Very well,\" said Bliss, with a sudden brilliant smile. \"Earth is theworld where our forebears came from, Fallom. Yours and mine and Pel\u0027sand Trevize\u0027s.\"\"Yours, Bliss and mine also.\" Fallom sounded puzzled. \"Bothof them?\"\"There\u0027s just one set of forebears,\" said Bliss. \"We had the sameforebears, all of us.\"Trevize said, \"It sounds to me as though the child knows very wellthat she\u0027s different from us.\"Bliss said to Trevize in a low voice, \"Don\u0027t say that. She must bemade to see she isn\u0027t. Not in essentials.\"\"Hermaphrodism is essential, I should think.\"\"I\u0027m talking about the mind.\"\"Transducer-lobes are essential, too.\"\"Now, Trevize, don\u0027t be difficult. She\u0027s intelligent and humanregardless of details.\"She turned to Fallom, her voice rising to its normal level. \"Thinkquietly about this, Fallom, and see what it means to you. Your forebearsand mine were the same. All the people on all the worlds many,many worlds all had the same forebears, and those forebears livedoriginally on the world named Earth. That means we\u0027re all relatives,doesn\u0027t it? Now go back to our room and think of that.\"Fallom, after bestowing a thoughtful look on Trevize, turned and ranoff, hastened on by Bliss\u0027s affectionate slap on her backside. \n Bliss turned to Trevize, and said, \"Please, Trevize, promise me youwon\u0027t make any comments in her hearing that will lead her to think she\u0027sdifferent from us.\"Trevize said, \"I promise. I have no wish to impede or subvert theeducational procedure, but, you know, she is different from us.\"\"In ways. As I\u0027m different from you, and as Pel is.\"\"Don\u0027t be na飗e, Bliss. The differences in Fallom\u0027s case aremuch greater.\"\"A little greater. The similarities are vastly moreimportant. She, and her people, will be part of Galaxia some day, anda very useful part, I\u0027m sure.\"\"All right. We won\u0027t argue.\" He turned to the computer with clearreluctance. \"And meanwhile, I\u0027m afraid I have to check the supposedposition of Earth in real space.\"\"Afraid?\"\"Well,\" Trevize lifted his shoulders in what he hoped was ahalf-humorous way, \"what if there\u0027s no suitable star near the place?\"\"Then there isn\u0027t,\" said Bliss. \n \"I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s any point in checking it out now. We won\u0027tbe able to make a Jump for several days.\"\"And you\u0027ll be spending them agonizing over the possibilities. Findout now. Waiting won\u0027t change matters.\"Trevize sat there with his lips compressed for a moment, then said,\"You\u0027re right. Very well, then here goes.\"He turned to the computer, placed his hands on the handmarks on thedesk, and the viewscreen went dark. \n Bliss said, \"I\u0027ll leave you, then. I\u0027ll make you nervous if Istay.\" She left, with a wave of her hand. \n \"The thing is,\" he muttered, \"that we\u0027re going to be checking thecomputer\u0027s Galactic map first and even if Earth\u0027s sun is in the calculatedposition, the map should not include it. But we\u0027ll then \"His voice trailed off in astonishment as the viewscreen flashedwith a background of stars. These were fairly numerous and dim, with anoccasional brighter one sparkling here and there, well scattered overthe face of the screen. But quite close to the center was a star thatwas brighter than all the rest. \n \"We\u0027ve got it,\" said Pelorat jubilantly. \"We\u0027ve got it, old chap. Lookhow bright it is.\"\"Any star at centered co-ordinates would look bright,\" said Trevize,clearly trying to fight off any initial jubilation that might proveunfounded. \"The view, after all, is presented from a distance of a parsecfrom the centered co-ordinates. Still, that centered star certainly isn\u0027ta red dwarf, or a red giant, or a hot blue-white. Wait for information;the computer is checking its data banks.\"There was silence for a few seconds and then Trevize said,\"Spectral class G-2.\" Another pause, then, \"Diameter, 1.4 millionkilometers mass, 1.02 times that of Terminus\u0027s sun surfacetemperature, 6,000 absolute rotation slow, just under thirtydays no unusual activity or irregularity.\"Pelorat said, \"Isn\u0027t all that typical of the kind of star about whichhabitable planets are to be found?\"\"Typical,\" said Trevize, nodding in the dimness. \"And, therefore,what we\u0027d expect Earth\u0027s sun to be like. If that is where life developed,the sun of Earth would have set the original standard.\"\"So there is a reasonable chance that there would be a habitableplanet circling it.\"\"We don\u0027t have to speculate about that,\" said Trevize, who soundedpuzzled indeed over the matter. \"The Galactic map lists it as possessinga planet with human life but with a question mark.\"Pelorat\u0027s enthusiasm grew. \"That\u0027s exactly what we would expect,Golan. The life-bearing planet is there, but the attempt to hide thefact obscures data concerning it and leaves the makers of the map thecomputer uses uncertain.\"\"No, that\u0027s what bothers me,\" said Trevize. \"That\u0027s not what we shouldexpect. We should expect far more than that. Considering the efficiencywith which data concerning Earth has been wiped out, the makers of themap should not have known that life exists in the system, let alonehuman life. They should not even have known Earth\u0027s sun exists. TheSpacer worlds aren\u0027t on the map. Why should Earth\u0027s sun be?\"\"Well, it\u0027s there, just the same. What\u0027s the use of arguing thefact? What other information about the star is given?\"\"A name.\"\"Ah! What is it?\"\"Alpha.\"There was a short pause, then Pelorat said eagerly, \"That\u0027s it,old man. That\u0027s the final bit of evidence. Consider the meaning.\"\"Does it have a meaning?\" said Trevize. \"It\u0027s just a name to me,and an odd one. It doesn\u0027t sound Galactic.\"\"It isn\u0027t Galactic. It\u0027s in a prehistoric language ofEarth, the same one that gave us Gaia as the name of Bliss\u0027s planet.\"\"What does Alpha mean, then?\"\"Alpha is the first letter of the alphabet of that ancientlanguage. That is one of the most firmly attested scraps of knowledgewe have about it. In ancient times, `alpha\u0027 was sometimes used to meanthe first of anything. To call a sun `Alpha,\u0027 implies that it\u0027s thefirst sun. And wouldn\u0027t the first sun be the one around which a planetrevolved that was the first planet to bear human life Earth?\"\"Are you sure of that?\"\"Absolutely,\" said Pelorat. \n \"Is there anything in early legends you\u0027re the mythologist,after all that gives Earth\u0027s sun some very unusual attribute?\"\"No, how can there be? It has to be standard by definition, and thecharacteristics the computer has given us ate as standard as possible,I imagine. Aren\u0027t they?\"\"Earth\u0027s sun is a single star, I suppose?\"Pelorat said, \"Well, of course! As far as I know, all inhabited worldsorbit single stars.\"\"So I would have thought myself,\" said Trevize. \"The trouble isthat that star in the center of the viewscreen is not a single star,it is a binary. The brighter of the two stars making up the binary isindeed standard and it is that one for which the computer supplied uswith data. Circling that star with a period of roughly eighty years,however, is another star with a mass four-fifths that of the brighterone. We can\u0027t see the two as separate stars with the unaided eye, butif I were to enlarge the view, I\u0027m sure we would.\"\"Are you certain of that, Golan?\" said Pelorat, taken aback. \n \"It\u0027s what the computer is telling me. And if we are looking at abinary star, then it\u0027s not Earth\u0027s sun. It can\u0027t be.\"71. \n Trevize broke contact with the computer, and the lightsbrightened. \n That was the signal, apparently, for Bliss to return, with Fallomtagging after her. \"Well, then, what are the results?\" she asked. \n Trevize said tonelessly, \"Somewhat disappointing. Where I expectedto find Earth\u0027s sun, I found a binary star, instead. Earth\u0027s sun is asingle star, so the one centered is not it.\"Pelorat said, \"Now what, Golan?\"Trevize shrugged. \"I didn\u0027t really expect to see Earth\u0027s suncentered. Even the Spacers wouldn\u0027t settle worlds in such a way as toset up an exact sphere. Aurora, the oldest of the Spacer worlds, mighthave sent out settlers of its own and that may have distorted the sphere,too. Then, too, Earth\u0027s sun may not have moved at precisely the averagevelocity of the Spacer worlds.\"Pelorat said, \"So the Earth can be anywhere. Is that what you\u0027resaying?\"\"No. Not quite `anywhere.\u0027 All these possible sources of error can\u0027tamount to much. Earth\u0027s sun must be in the vicinity of theco-ordinates. The star we\u0027ve spotted almost exactly at the co-ordinatesmust be a neighbor of Earth\u0027s sun. It\u0027s startling that there should bea neighbor that so closely resembles Earth\u0027s sun except for beinga binary but that must be the case.\"\"But we would see Earth\u0027s sun on the map, then, wouldn\u0027t we? I mean,near Alpha?\"\"No, for I\u0027m certain Earth\u0027s sun isn\u0027t on the map at all. It was thatwhich shook my confidence when we first spied Alpha. Regardless of howmuch it might resemble Earth\u0027s sun, the mere fact that it was on themap made me suspect it was not the real thing.\"\"Well, then,\" said Bliss. \"Why not concentrate on the same co-ordinatesin real space? Then, if there is any bright star close to the center,a star that does not exist in the computer\u0027s map, and if it is verymuch like Alpha in its properties, but is single, might it not beEarth\u0027s sun?\"Trevize sighed. \"If all that were so, I\u0027d be willing to wager halfmy fortune, such as it is, that circling that star you speak of wouldbe the planet Earth. Again, I hesitate to try.\"\"Because you might fail?\"Trevize nodded. \"However,\" he said, \"just give me a moment or two tocatch my breath, and I\u0027ll force myself to do so.\"And while the three adults looked at each other, Fallom approachedthe computer-desk and stared curiously at the handmarks upon it. Shereached out her own hand tentatively toward the markings, and Trevizeblocked the motion with a swift outthrusting of his own arm and a sharp,\"Mustn\u0027t touch, Fallom.\"The young Solarian seemed startled, and retreated to the comfort ofBliss\u0027s encircling arm. \n Pelorat said, \"We must face it, Golan. What if you find nothing inreal space?\"\"Then we will be forced to go back to the earlier plan,\" said Trevize,\"and visit each of the forty-seven Spacer worlds in turn.\"\"And if that yields nothing, Golan?\"Trevize shook his head in annoyance, as though to prevent that thoughtfrom taking too deep a root. Staring down at his knees, he said abruptly,\"Then I will think of something else.\"\"But what if there is no world of forebears at all?\"Trevize looked up sharply at the treble voice. \"Who said that?\" heasked. \n It was a useless question. The moment of disbelief faded, and he knewvery well who the questioner was. \n \"I did,\" said Fallom. \n Trevize looked at her with a slight frown. \"Did you understand theconversation?\"Fallom said, \"You are looking for the world of forebears, but youhaven\u0027t found it yet. Maybe there isn\u0027t no such world.\"\" Any such world,\" said Bliss softly. \n \"No, Fallom,\" said Trevize seriously. \"There has been a very bigeffort to hide it. To try so hard to hide something means there issomething there to hide. Do you understand what I am saying?\"\"Yes,\" said Fallom. \"You do not let me touch the hands on the deck. \n Because you do not let me do that means it would be interesting totouch them.\"\"Ah, but not for you, Fallom. Bliss, you are creating a monsterthat will destroy us all. Don\u0027t ever let her in here unless I\u0027m at thedesk. And even then, think twice, will you?\"The small byplay, however, seemed to have shaken him out of hisirresolution. He said, \"Obviously, I had better get to work. If I justsit here, uncertain as to what to do, that little fright will take overthe ship.\"The lights dimmed, and Bliss said in a low voice, \"You promised,Trevize. Do not call her a monster or a fright in her hearing.\"\"Then keep an eye on her, and teach her some manners. Tell her childrenshould be never heard and seldom seen.\"Bliss frowned. \"Your attitude toward children is simply appalling,Trevize.\"\"Maybe, but this is not the time to discuss the matter.\"Then he said, in tones in which satisfaction and relief were equallyrepresented, \"There\u0027s Alpha again in real space. And to its left,and slightly upward, is almost as bright a star and one that isn\u0027t inthe computer\u0027s Galactic map. That is Earth\u0027s sun. I\u0027llwager all my fortune on it.\"72\"Well, now,\" said Bliss, \"we won\u0027t take any part ofyour fortune if you lose, so why not settle the matter in a forthrightmanner? Let\u0027s visit the star as soon as you can make the Jump.\"Trevize shook his head. \"No. This time it\u0027s not a matter ofirresolution or fear. It\u0027s a matter of being careful. Three times we\u0027vevisited an unknown world and three times we\u0027ve come up against somethingunexpectedly dangerous. And three times, moreover, we\u0027ve had to leavethat world in a hurry. This time the matter is ultimately crucial andI will not play my cards in ignorance again; or at least in any moreignorance than I can help. So far, all we have are vague stories aboutradioactivity, and that is not enough. By an odd chance that no one couldhave anticipated, there is a planet with human life about a parsec fromEarth \"\"Do we really know that Alpha has a planet with human life on it?\" putin Pelorat. \"You said the computer placed a question mark after that.\"\"Even so,\" said Trevize, \"it\u0027s worth trying. Why not take a look atit? If it does indeed have human beings on it, let us find out what theyknow about Earth. For them, after all, Earth is not a distant thing oflegend; it is a neighbor world, bright and prominent in their sky.\"Bliss said thoughtfully, \"It\u0027s not a bad idea. It occurs to me thatif Alpha is inhabited and if the inhabitants are not your thoroughlytypical Isolates, they may be friendly, and we might be able to get somedecent food for a change.\"\"And meet some pleasant people,\" said Trevize. \"Don\u0027t forget that. Willit be all right with you, Janov?\"Pelorat said, \"You make the decision, old chap. Wherever you go,I will go, too.\"Fallom said suddenly, \"Will we find Jemby?\"Bliss said hastily, before Trevize could answer, \"We will look forit, Fallom.\"And then Trevize said, \"It\u0027s settled then. On to Alpha.\"73\"Two big stars,\" said Fallom, pointing to the viewscreen. \n \"That\u0027s right,\" said Trevize. \"Two of them. Bliss, do keep aneye on her. I don\u0027t want her fiddling with anything.\"\"She\u0027s fascinated by machinery,\" said Bliss. \n \"Yes, I know she is,\" said Trevize, \"but I\u0027m not fascinated by herfascination. Though to tell you the truth, I\u0027m as fascinated asshe is at seeing two stars that bright in the viewscreen at the sametime.\"The two stars were bright enough to seem to be on the point of showinga disc each of them. The screen had automatically increasedfiltration density in order to remove the hard radiation and dim thelight of the bright stars so as to avoid retinal damage. As a result,few other stars were bright enough to be noticeable, and the two thatwere reigned in haughty near-isolation. \n \"The thing is,\" said Trevize, \"I\u0027ve never been this close to a binarysystem before.\"\"You haven\u0027t?\" said Pelorat, open astonishment in his voice. \"How isthat possible?\"Trevize laughed. \"I\u0027ve been around, Janov, but I\u0027m not the Galacticrover you think I am.\"Pelorat said, \"I was never in space at all till I met you, Golan, butI always thought that anyone who did manage to get into space \"\"Would go everywhere. I know. That\u0027s natural enough. The troublewith planet-bound people is that no matter how much their mind may tellthem otherwise, their imaginations just can\u0027t take in the true size ofthe Galaxy. We could travel all our lives and leave most of the Galaxyunpenetrated and untouched. Besides, no one ever goes to binaries.\"\"Why not?\" said Bliss, frowning. \"We on Gaia know little astronomycompared to the traveling Isolates of the Galaxy, but I\u0027m under theimpression that binaries aren\u0027t rare.\"\"They\u0027re not,\" said Trevize. \"There are substantially more binariesthan there are single stars. However, the formation of two stars in closeassociation upsets the ordinary processes of planetary formation. Binarieshave less planetary material than single stars do. Such planets as doform about them often have relatively unstable orbits and are very rarelyof a type that is reasonably habitable. \n \"Early explorers, I imagine, studied many binaries at close range but,after a while, for settlement purposes, they sought out only singles. And,of course, once you have a densely settled Galaxy, virtually all travelinvolves trade and communications and is carried on between inhabitedworlds circling single stars. In periods of military activity, I supposebases were sometimes set up on small, otherwise-uninhabited worldscircling one of the stars of a binary that happened to be strategicallyplaced, but as hyperspatial travel came to be perfected, such bases wereno longer necessary.\"Pelorat said humbly, \"It\u0027s amazing how much I don\u0027t know.\"Trevize merely grinned. \"Don\u0027t let that impress you, Janov. WhenI was in the Navy, we listened to an incredible number of lectures onoutmoded military tactics that no one ever planned, or intended to use,and were just talked about out of inertia. I was just rattling off a bitof one of them.
