{"id":136,"no":22,"title":"Part Four - Solaria Chapter 10: Robots","content":"41Trevize seemed lost in thought during dinner, and Blissconcentrated on the food. \\n\\n Pelorat, the only one who seemed anxious to speak, pointed out that ifthe world they were on was Aurora and if it was the first settled world,it ought to be fairly close to Earth. \\n\\n \"It might pay to scour the immediate stellar neighborhood,\" hesaid. \"It would only mean sifting through a few hundred stars atmost.\"Trevize muttered that hit-and-miss was a last resort and he wanted asmuch information about Earth as possible before attempting to approachit even if he found it. He said no more and Pelorat, clearly squelched,dwindled into silence as well. \\n\\n After the meal, as Trevize continued to volunteer nothing, Peloratsaid tentatively, \"Are we to be staying here, Golan?\"\"Overnight, anyway,\" said Trevize. \"I need to do a bit morethinking.\"\"Is it safe?\"\"Unless there\u0027s something worse than dogs about,\" said Trevize,\"we\u0027re quite safe here in the ship.\"Pelorat said, \"How long would it take to lift off, if there issomething worse than dogs about?\"Trevize said, \"The computer is on launch alert. I think we can manageto take off in between two and three minutes. And it will warn us quiteeffectively if anything unexpected takes place, so I suggest we allget some sleep. Tomorrow morning, I\u0027ll come to a decision as to thenext move.\"Easy to say, thought Trevize, as he found himself staring at thedarkness. He was curled up, partly dressed, on the floor of the computerroom. It was quite uncomfortable, but he was sure that his bed would beno more conducive to sleep at this time and here at least he could takeaction at once if the computer sounded an alarm. \\n\\n Then he heard footsteps and automatically sat up, hitting his headagainst the edge of the desk not hard enough to do damage, buthard enough to make rubbing and grimacing a necessity. \\n\\n \"Janov?\" he said in a muffled voice, eyes tearing. \\n\\n \"No. It\u0027s Bliss.\"Trevize reached over the edge of the table with one hand to make atleast semicontact with the computer, and a soft light showed Bliss ina light pink wraparound. \\n\\n Trevize said, \"What is it?\"\"I looked in your bedroom and you weren\u0027t there. There was no mistakingyour neuronic activity, however, and I followed it. You were clearlyawake so I walked in.\"\"Yes, but what is it you want?\"She sat down against the wall, knees up, and cradled her chin againstthem. She said, \"Don\u0027t be concerned. I have no designs on what\u0027s leftof your virginity.\"\"I don\u0027t imagine you do,\" said Trevize sardonically. \"Why aren\u0027t youasleep? You need it more than we do.\"\"Believe me,\" she said in a low, heartfelt tone, \"that episode withthe dogs was very draining.\"\"I believe that.\"\"But I had to talk to you when Pel was sleeping.\"\"About what?\"Bliss said, \"When he told you about the robot, you said that thatchanges everything. What did you mean?\"Trevize said, \"Don\u0027t you see that for yourself? We have three setsof coordinates; three Forbidden Worlds. I want to visit all three tolearn as much as possible about Earth before trying to reach it.\"He edged a bit closer so that he could speak lower still, then drewaway sharply. He said, \"Look, I don\u0027t want Janov coming in here lookingfor us. I don\u0027t know what he\u0027d think.\"\"It\u0027s not likely. He\u0027s sleeping and I\u0027ve encouraged that just a bit. Ifhe stirs, I\u0027ll know. Go on. You want to visit all three. What\u0027schanged?\"\"It wasn\u0027t part of my plan to waste time on any world needlessly. Ifthis world, Aurora, had been without human occupation for twenty thousandyears, then it is doubtful that any information of value has survived. Idon\u0027t want to spend weeks or months scrabbling uselessly about theplanetary surface, fighting off dogs and cats and bulls or whatever elsemay have become wild and dangerous, just on the hope of finding a scrap ofreference material amid the dust, rust, and decay. It may be that on oneor both of the other Forbidden Worlds there may be human beings and intactlibraries. So it was my intention to leave this world at once. We\u0027dbe out in space now, if I had done so, sleeping in perfect security.\"\"But?\"\"But if there are robots still functioning on this world, they mayhave important information that we could use. They would be safer todeal with than human beings would be, since, from what I\u0027ve heard,they must follow orders and can\u0027t harm human beings.\"\"So you\u0027ve changed your plan and now you\u0027re going to spend time onthis world searching for robots.\"\"I don\u0027t want to, Bliss. It seems to me that robots can\u0027t last twentythousand years without maintenance. Yet since you\u0027ve seen one witha spark of activity still, it\u0027s clear I can\u0027t rely on my commonsenseguesses about robots. I mustn\u0027t lead out of ignorance. Robots may bemore enduring than I imagine, or they may have a certain capacity forself-maintenance.\"Bliss said, \"Listen to me, Trevize, and please keep thisconfidential.\"\"Confidential?\" said Trevize, raising his voice in surprise. \"Fromwhom?\"\"Sh! From Pel, of course. Look, you don\u0027t have to change yourplans. You were right the first time. There are no functioning robotson this world. I detect nothing.\"\"You detected that one, and one is as good as \"\"I did not detect that one. It was nonfunctioning; long nonfunctioning.\"\"You said \"\"I know what I said. Pel thought he saw motion and heard sound. Pelis a romantic. He\u0027s spent his working life gathering data, but that is adifficult way of making one\u0027s mark in the scholarly world. He would dearlylove to make an important discovery of his own. His finding of the word`Aurora\u0027 was legitimate and made him happier than you can imagine. Hewanted desperately to find more.\"Trevize said, \"Are you telling me he wanted to make a discovery sobadly he convinced himself he had come upon a functioning robot whenhe hadn\u0027t?\"\"What he came upon was a lump of rust containing no more consciousnessthan the rock against which it rested.\"\"But you supported his story.\"\"I could not bring myself to rob him of his discovery. He means somuch to me. \\n\\n Trevize stared at her for a full minute; then he said, \"Do you mindexplaining why he means so much to you? I want to know. Ireally want to know. To you he must seem an elderly man with nothingromantic about him. He\u0027s an Isolate, and you despise Isolates. You\u0027reyoung and beautiful and there must be other parts of Gaia that havethe bodies of vigorous and handsome young men. With them you can havea physical relationship that can resonate through Gaia and bring peaksof ecstasy. So what do you an in Janov?\"Bliss looked at Trevize solemnly. \"Don\u0027t you love him?\"Trevize shrugged and said, \"I\u0027m fond of him. I suppose you could say,in a nonsexual way, that I love him.\"\"You haven\u0027t known him very long, Trevize. Why do you love him,in that nonsexual way of yours?\"Trevize found himself smiling without being aware of it. \"He\u0027s suchan odd fellow. I honestly think that never in his life hashe given a single thought to himself. He was ordered to go along with me,and he went. No objection. He wanted me to go to Trantor, but when I saidI wanted to go to Gaia, he never argued. And now he\u0027s come along withme in this search for Earth, though he must know it\u0027s dangerous. I feelperfectly confident that if he had to sacrifice his life for me orfor anyone he would, and without repining.\"\"Would you give your life for him, Trevize?\"\"I might, if I didn\u0027t have time to think. If I did have time to think,I would hesitate and I might funk it. I\u0027m not as good as heis. And because of that, I have this terrible urge to protect and keephim good. I don\u0027t want the Galaxy to teach him not to begood. Do you understand? And I have to protect him from you particularly. I can\u0027t bear the thought of you tossing him aside whenwhatever nonsense amuses you now is done with.\"\"Yes, I thought you\u0027d think something like that. Don\u0027t you supposeI see in Pel what you see in him and even more so, since I cancontact his mind directly? Do I act as though I want to hurt him? WouldI support his fantasy of having seen a functioning robot, if it weren\u0027tthat I couldn\u0027t bear to hurt him? Trevize, I am used to what you wouldcall goodness, for every part of Gaia is ready to be sacrificed for thewhole. We know and understand no other course of action. But we give upnothing in so doing, for each part is the whole, though I don\u0027t expectyou to understand that. Pel is something different.\"Bliss was no longer looking at Trevize. It was as though she weretalking to herself. \"He is an Isolate. He is not selfless because he isa part of a greater whole. He is selfless because he is selfless. Doyou understand me? He has all to lose and nothing to gain, and yet heis what he is. He shames me for being what I am without fear of loss,when he is what he is without hope of gain.\"She looked up at Trevize again now, very solemnly. \"Do you know howmuch more I understand about him than you possibly can? And do you thinkI would harm him in any way?\"Trevize said, \"Bliss, earlier today, you said, `Come, let us befriends,\u0027 and all I replied was, `If you wish.\u0027 That was grudging ofme, for I was thinking of what you might do to Janov. It is my turn,now. Come, Bliss, let us be friends. You can keep on pointing out theadvantage of Galaxia and I may keep on refusing to accept your arguments,but even so, and despite that, let us be friends.\" And he held outhis hand. \\n\\n \"Of course, Trevize,\" she said, and their hands gripped each otherstrongly. \\n\\n 42Trevize grinned quietly to himself. It was an internalgrin, for the line of his mouth didn\u0027t budge. \\n\\n When he had worked with the computer to find the star (if any) of thefirst set of co-ordinates, both Pelorat and Bliss had watched intentlyand had asked questions. Now they stayed in their room and slept or,at any rate, relaxed, and left the job entirely to Trevize. \\n\\n In a way, it was flattering, for it seemed to Trevize that by now theyhad simply accepted the fact that Trevize knew what he was doing andrequired no supervision or encouragement. For that matter, Trevize hadgained enough experience from the first episode to rely more thoroughlyon the computer and to feel that it needed, if not none, then at leastless supervision. \\n\\n Another star luminous and unrecorded on the Galactic map-showedup. This second star was more luminous than the star about which Auroracircled, and that made it all the more significant that the star wasunrecorded in the computer. \\n\\n Trevize marveled at the peculiarities of ancient tradition. Wholecenturies might be telescoped or dropped out of consciousnessaltogether. Entire civilizations might be banished into forgetfulness. Yetout of the midst of these centuries, snatched from those civilizations,might be one or two factual items that would be rememberedundistorted such as these co-ordinates. \\n\\n He had remarked on this to Pelorat some time before, and Pelorathad at once told him that it was precisely this that made the studyof myths and legends so rewarding. \"The trick is,\" Pelorat had said,\"to work out or decide which particular components of a legend representaccurate underlying truth. That isn\u0027t easy and different mythologistsare likely to pick different components, depending, usually, on whichhappen to suit their particular interpretations.\" . \\n\\n In any case, the star was right where Deniador\u0027s co-ordinates,corrected for time, said it would be. Trevize was prepared, at thismoment, to wager a considerable sum that the third star would be inplace as well. And if it was, Trevize was prepared to suspect that thelegend was further correct in stating that there were fifty ForbiddenWorlds altogether (despite the suspiciously even number) and to wonderwhere the other forty-seven might be. \\n\\n A habitable world, Forbidden World, was found circling thestar and by this time its presence didn\u0027t cause even a ripple ofsurprise in Trevize\u0027s bosom. He had been absolutely sure it would bethere. He set the Far Star into a slow orbit about it. \\n\\n The cloud layer was sparse enough to allow a reasonable view of thesurface from space. The world was a watery one, as almost all habitableworlds were. There was an unbroken tropical ocean and two unbrokenpolar oceans. \\n\\n In one set of middle latitudes, there was a more or less serpentinecontinent encircling the world with bays on either side producing anoccasional narrow isthmus. In the other set of middle latitudes, theland surface was broken into three large parts and each of the threewere thicker north-south than the opposite continent was. \\n\\n Trevize wished he knew enough climatology to be able to predict,from what he saw, what the temperatures and seasons might be like. Fora moment, he toyed with the idea of having the computer work on theproblem. The trouble was that climate was not the point at issue. \\n\\n Much more important was that, once again, the computer detected noradiation that might be of technological origin. What his telescope toldhim was that the planet was not moth-eaten and that there were no signs ofdesert. The land moved backward in various shades of green, but there wereno signs of urban areas on the dayside, no lights on the nightside. \\n\\n Was this another planet filled with every kind of life but human? \\n\\n He rapped at the door of the other bedroom. \\n\\n \"Bliss?\" he called out in a loud whisper, and rapped again. \\n\\n There was a rustling, and Bliss\u0027s voice said, \"Yes?\"\"Could you come out here? I need your help \"\"If you wait just a bit, I\u0027ll make myself a bit presentable.\"When she finally appeared, she looked as presentable as Trevize hadever seen her. He felt a twinge of annoyance at having been made to wait,however, for it made little difference to him what she looked like. Butthey were friends now, and he suppressed the annoyance. \\n\\n She said with a smile and in a perfectly pleasant tone, \"What can Ido for you, Trevize?\"Trevize waved at the viewscreen. \"As you can see, we\u0027re passing overthe surface of what looks like a perfectly healthy world with a quitesolid vegetation cover over its land area. No lights at night, however,and no technological radiation. Please listen and tell me if there\u0027s anyanimal life. There was one point at which I thought I could see herdsof grazing animals, but I wasn\u0027t sure. It might be a case of seeing whatone desperately wants to see.\"Bliss \"listened.\" At least, a curiously intent look came across herface. She said, \"Oh yes rich in animal life.\"\"Mammalian?\"\"Must be.\"\"Human?\"Now she seemed to concentrate harder. A full minute passed, andthen another, and finally she relaxed. \"I can\u0027t quite tell. Every oncein a while it seemed to me that I detected a whiff of intelligencesufficiently intense to be considered human. But it was so feeble andso occasional that perhaps I, too, was only sensing what I desperatelywanted to sense. You see \"She paused in thought, and Trevize nudged her with a \"Well?\"She said, \"The thing is I seem to detect something else. It is notsomething I\u0027m familiar with, but I don\u0027t see how it can be anythingbut \"Her face tightened again as she began to \"listen\" with still greaterintensity. \\n\\n \"Well?\" said Trevize again. \\n\\n She relaxed. \"I don\u0027t see how it can be anything but robots.\"\"Robots!\"\"Yes, and if I detect them, surely I ought to be able to detect humanbeings, too. But I don\u0027t.\"\"Robots!\" said Trevize again, frowning. \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Bliss, \"and I should judge, in great numbers.\"43Pelorat also said \"Robots!\" in almost exactly Trevize\u0027stone when he was told of them. Then he smiled slightly. \"You were right,Golan, and I was wrong to doubt you.\"\"I don\u0027t remember your doubting me, Janov.\"\"Oh well, old man, I didn\u0027t think I ought to express it. I justthought, in my heart, that it was a mistake to leave Aurora while therewas a chance we might interview some surviving robot. But then it\u0027sclear you knew there would be a richer supply of robots here.\"\"Not at all, Janov. I didn\u0027t know . I merely chancedit. Bliss tells me their mental fields seem to imply they are fullyfunctioning, and it seems to me they can\u0027t very well be fully functioningwithout human beings about for care and maintenance. However, she can\u0027tspot anything human so we\u0027re still looking.\"Pelorat studied the viewscreen thoughtfully. \"It seems to be allforest, doesn\u0027t it?\"\"Mostly forest. But there are clear patches that may be grasslands. Thething is that I see no cities, or any lights at night, or anything butthermal radiation at any time.\"\"So no human beings after all?\"\"I wonder. Bliss is in the galley trying to concentrate. I\u0027ve setup an arbitrary prime meridian for the planet which means that it\u0027sdivided into latitude and longitude in the computer. Bliss has a littledevice which she presses whenever she encounters what seems an unusualconcentration of robotic mental activity I suppose you can\u0027t say`neuronic activity\u0027 in connection with robots or any whiff ofhuman thought. The device is linked to the computer, which thus getsa fix on all the latitudes and longitudes, and we\u0027ll let it make thechoice among them and pick a good place for landing.\"Pelorat looked uneasy. \"Is it wise to leave the matter of choice tothe computer?\"\"Why not, Janov? It\u0027s a very competent computer. Besides, when youhave no basis on which to make a choice yourself, where\u0027s the harm inat least considering the computer\u0027s choice?\"Pelorat brightened up. \"There\u0027s something to that, Golan. Some of theoldest legends include tales of people making choices by tossing cubesto the ground.\"\"Oh? What does that accomplish?\"\"Each face of the cube has some decision onit yes no perhaps postpone and soon. Whichever face happens to come upward on landing would be taken asbearing the advice to be followed. Or they would set a ball rolling abouta slotted disc with different decisions scattered among the slots. Thedecision written on the slot in which the ball ends is to be taken. Somemythologists think such activities represented games of chance ratherthan lotteries, but the two are much the same thing in my opinion.\"\"In a way,\" said Trevize, \"we\u0027re playing a game of chance in choosingour place of landing.\"Bliss emerged from the galley in time to hear the last comment. Shesaid, \"No game of chance. I pressed several `maybes\u0027 and then onesure-fire `yes,\u0027 and it\u0027s to the `yes\u0027 that we\u0027ll be going.\"\"What made it a `yes\u0027?\" asked Trevize. \\n\\n \"I caught a whiff of human thought. Definite. Unmistakable.\"44It had been raining, for the grass was wet. Overhead,the clouds were scudding by and showing signs of breaking up. \\n\\n The Far Star had come to a gentle rest near a small grove oftrees. (In case of wild dogs, Trevize thought, only partly in jest.) Allabout was what looked like pasture land, and coming down from the greaterheight at which a better and wider view had been possible, Trevize hadseen what looked like orchards and grain fields and this time,an unmistakable view of grazing animals. \\n\\n There were no structures, however. Nothing artificial, except thatthe regularity of the trees in the orchard and the sharp boundaries thatseparated fields were themselves as artificial as a microwave-receivingpower station would have been. \\n\\n Could that level of artificiality have been produced by robots,however? Without human beings? \\n\\n Quietly, Trevize was putting on his holsters. This time, he knew thatboth weapons were in working order and that both were fully charged. Fora moment, he caught Bliss\u0027s eye and paused. \\n\\n She said, \"Go ahead. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll have any use for them,but I thought as much once before, didn\u0027t I?\"Trevize said, \"Would you like to be armed, Janov?\"Pelorat shuddered. \"No, thank you. Between you and your physicaldefense, and Bliss and her mental defense, I feel in no danger at all. Isuppose it is cowardly of me to hide in your protective shadows, butI can\u0027t feel proper shame when I\u0027m too busy feeling grateful that Ineedn\u0027t be in a position of possibly having to use force.\"Trevize said, \"I understand. Just don\u0027t go anywhere alone. If Blissand I separate, you stay with one of us and don\u0027t dash off somewhereunder the spur of a private curiosity.\"\"You needn\u0027t worry, Trevize,\" said Bliss. \"I\u0027ll see to that.\"Trevize stepped out of the ship first. The wind was brisk and justa trifle cool in the aftermath of the rain, but Trevize found thatwelcome. It had probably been uncomfortably warm and humid before therain. \\n\\n He took in his breath with surprise. The smell of the planet wasdelightful. Every planet had its own odor, he knew, an odor always strangeand usually distasteful perhaps only because it was strange. Mightnot strange be pleasant as well? Or was this the accident of catching theplanet just after the rain at a particular season of the year. Whicheverit was \"Come on,\" he called. \"It\u0027s quite pleasant out here.\"Pelorat emerged and said, \"Pleasant is definitely the word for it. Doyou suppose it always smells like this?\"\"It doesn\u0027t matter. Within the hour, we\u0027ll be accustomed to the aroma,and our nasal receptors will be sufficiently saturated, for us to smellnothing.\"\"Pity,\" said Pelorat. \\n\\n \"The grass is wet,\" said Bliss, with a shade of disapproval. \\n\\n \"Why not? After all, it rains on Gaia, too!\" said Trevize, and as hesaid that a shaft of yellow sunlight reached them momentarily througha small break in the clouds. There would soon be more of it. \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Bliss, \"but we know when and we\u0027re prepared for it.\"\"Too bad,\" said Trevize; \"you lose the thrill of the unexpected.\"Bliss said, \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027ll try not to be provincial.\"Pelorat looked about and said, in a disappointed tone, \"There seemsto be nothing about.\"\"Only seems to be,\" said Bliss. \"They\u0027re approaching from beyondthat rise.\" She looked toward Trevize. \"Do you think we ought to go tomeet them?\"Trevize shook his head. \"No. We\u0027ve come to meet them across manyparsecs. Let them walk the rest of the way. We\u0027ll wait for them here.\"Only Bliss could sense the approach until, from the direction of herpointing finger, a figure appeared over the brow of the rise. Then asecond, and a third. \\n\\n \"I believe that is all at the moment,\" said Bliss. \\n\\n Trevize watched curiously. Though he had never seen robots, therewas not a particle of doubt in him that that was what they were. Theyhad the schematic and impressionistic shape of human beings and yet werenot obviously metallic in appearance. The robotic surface was dull andgave the illusion of softness, as though it were covered in plush. \\n\\n But how did he know the softness was an illusion? Trevize felt a suddendesire to feel those figures who were approaching so stolidly. If it weretrue that this was a Forbidden World and that spaceships never approachedit and surely that must be so since the sun was not includedin the Galactic map then the Far Star and the people itcarried must represent something the robots had never experienced. Yetthey were reacting with steady certainty, as though they were workingtheir way through a routine exercise. \\n\\n Trevize said, in a low voice, \"Here we may have information we canget nowhere else in the Galaxy. We could ask them for the location ofEarth with reference to this world, and if they know, they will tellus. Who knows how long these things have functioned and endured? Theymay answer out of personal memory. Think of that.\"\"On the other hand,\" said Bliss, \"they may be recently manufacturedand may know nothing.\"\"Or,\" said Pelorat, \"they may know, but may refuse to tell us.\"Trevize said, \"I suspect they can\u0027t refuse unless they\u0027ve been orderednot to tell us, and why should such orders be issued when surely no oneon this planet could have expected our coming?\"At a distance of about three meters, the robots stopped. They saidnothing and made no further movement. \\n\\n Trevize, his hand on his blaster, said to Bliss, without taking hiseyes from the robot, \"Can you tell whether they are hostile?\"\"You\u0027ll have to allow for the fact that I have no experience whatsoeverwith their mental workings, Trevize, but I don\u0027t detect anything thatseems hostile.\"Trevize took his right hand away from the butt of the weapon, butkept it near. He raised his left hand, palm toward the robots, in what hehoped would be recognized as a gesture of peace and said, speaking slowly,\"I greet you. We come to this world as friends.\"The central robot of the three ducked his head in a kind of abortivebow that might also have been taken as a gesture of peace by an optimist,and replied. \\n\\n Trevize\u0027s jaw dropped in astonishment. In a world of Galacticcommunication, one did not think of failure in so fundamental aneed. However, the robot did not speak in Galactic Standard or anythingapproaching it. In fact, Trevize could not understand a word. \\n\\n 45Pelorat\u0027s surprise was as great as that of Trevize,but there was an obvious element of pleasure in it, too. \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that strange?\" he said. \\n\\n Trevize turned to him and said, with more than a touch of asperityin his voice, \"It\u0027s not strange. It\u0027s gibberish.\"Pelorat said, \"Not gibberish at all. It\u0027s Galactic, but very archaic. Icatch a few words. I could probably understand it easily if it werewritten down. It\u0027s the pronunciation that\u0027s the real puzzle.\"\"Well, what did it say?\"\"I think it told you it didn\u0027t understand what you said.\"Bliss said, \"I can\u0027t tell what it said, but what I sense ispuzzlement, which fits. That is, if I can trust my analysis of roboticemotion or if there is such a thing as robotic emotion.\"Speaking very slowly, and with difficulty, Pelorat said something,and the three robots ducked their head in unison. \\n\\n \"What was that?\" said Trevize. \\n\\n Pelorat said, \"I said I couldn\u0027t speak well, but I would try. I askedfor a little time. Dear me, old chap, this is fearfully interesting.\"\"Fearfully disappointing,\" muttered Trevize. \\n\\n \"You see,\" said Pelorat, \"every habitable planet in the Galaxy managesto work out its own variety of Galactic so that there are a milliondialects that are sometimes barely intercomprehensible, but they\u0027re allpulled together by the development of Galactic Standard. Assuming thisworld to have been isolated for twenty thousand years, the language wouldordinarily drift so far from that of the rest of the Galaxy as to be anentirely different language. That it isn\u0027t may be because the world hasa social system that depends upon robots which can only understand thelanguage as spoken in the fashion in which they were programmed. Ratherthan keep reprogramming, the language remained static and we now havewhat is to us merely a very archaic form of Galactic.\"\"There\u0027s an example,\" said Trevize, \"of how a robotized society canbe held static and made, to turn degenerate.\"\"But, my dear fellow,\" protested Pelorat, \"keeping a languagerelatively unchanged is not necessarily a sign of degeneration. There areadvantages to it. Documents preserved for centuries and millennia retaintheir meaning and give greater longevity and authority to historicalrecords. In the rest of the Galaxy, the language of Imperial edicts ofthe time of Hari Seldon already begins to sound quaint.\"\"And do you know this archaic Galactic?\"\"Not to say know , Golan. It\u0027s just that in studyingancient myths and legends I\u0027ve picked up the trick of it. The vocabularyis not entirely different, but it is inflected differently, and thereare idiomatic expressions we don\u0027t use any longer and, as I have said,the pronunciation is totally changed. I can act as interpreter, but notas a very good one.\"Trevize heaved a tremulous sigh. \"A small stroke of good fortune isbetter than none. Carry on, Janov.\"Pelorat turned to the robots, waited a moment, then looked back atTrevize. \"What am I supposed to say?\"\"Let\u0027s go all the way. Ask them where Earth is.\"Pelorat said the words one at a time, with exaggerated gestures ofhis hands. \\n\\n The robots looked at each other and made a few sounds. The middleone then spoke to Pelorat, who replied while moving his hands apart asthough he were stretching a length of rubber. The robot responded byspacing his words as carefully as Pelorat had. \\n\\n Pelorat said to Trevize, \"I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m getting across what I meanby `Earth.\u0027 I suspect they think I\u0027m referring to some region on theirplanet and they say they don\u0027t know of any such region.\"\"Do they use the name of this planet, Janov?\"\"The closest I can come to what I think they are using as the name is`Solaria.\u0027\"\"Have you ever heard of it in your legends?\"\"No any more than I had ever heard of Aurora.\"\"Well, ask them if there is any place named Earth in thesky among the stars. Point upward.\"Again an exchange, and finally Pelorat turned and said, \"All I canget from them, Golan, is that there are no places in the sky.\"Bliss said, \"Ask those robots how old they are; or rather, how longthey have been functioning.\"\"I don\u0027t know how to say `functioning,\u0027\" said Pelorat, shaking hishead. In fact, I\u0027m not sure if I can say `how old.\u0027 I\u0027m not a very good interpreter.\"\"Do the best you can, Pel dear,\" said Bliss. \\n\\n And after several exchanges, Pelorat said, \"They\u0027ve been functioningfor twenty-six years.\"\"Twenty-six years,\" muttered Trevize in disgust. \"They\u0027re hardlyolder than you are, Bliss.\"Bliss said, with sudden pride, \"It so happens \"\"I know. You\u0027re Gaia, which is thousands of years old. In anycase, these robots cannot talk about Earth from personal experience,and their memory-banks clearly do not include anything not necessary totheir functioning. So they know nothing about astronomy.\"Pelorat said, \"There may be other robots somewhere on the planet thatare primordial, perhaps.\"\"I doubt it,\" said Trevize, \"but ask them, if you can find the wordsfor it, Janov.\"This time there was quite a long conversation and Pelorat eventuallybroke it off with a flushed face and a clear air of frustration. \\n\\n \"Golan,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t understand part of what they\u0027re trying tosay, but I gather that the older robots are used for manual labor anddon\u0027t know anything. If this robot were a human, I\u0027d say he spoke ofthe older robots with contempt. These three are house robots, they say,and are not allowed to grow old before being replaced. They\u0027re the oneswho really know things their words, not mine.\"\"They don\u0027t know much,\" growled Trevize. \"At least of the things wewant to know.\"\"I now regret,\" said Pelorat, \"that we left Aurora so hurriedly. Ifwe had found a robot survivor there, and we surely would have, sincethe very first one I encountered still had a spark of life left in it,they would know of Earth through personal memory.\"\"Provided their memories were intact, Janov,\" said Trevize. \"Wecan always go back there and, if we have to, dog packs or not, wewill. But if these robots are only a couple of decades old,there must be those who manufacture them, and the manufacturers must behuman, I should think.\" He turned to Bliss. \"Are you sure you sensed \"But she raised a hand to stop him and there was a strained and intentlook on her face. \"Coming now,\" she said, in a low voice. \\n\\n Trevize turned his face toward the rise and there, first appearingfrom behind it, and then striding toward them, was the unmistakablefigure of a human being. His complexion was pale and his hair light andlong, standing out slightly from the sides of his head. His face wasgrave but quite young in appearance. His bare arms and legs were notparticularly muscled. \\n\\n The robots stepped aside for him, and he advanced till he stood intheir midst. \\n\\n He then spoke in a clear, pleasant voice and his words, although usedarchaically, were in Galactic Standard, and easily understood. \\n\\n \"Greetings, wanderers from space,\" he said. \"What would you withmy robots?\"46Trevize did not cover himself with glory. He saidfoolishly, \"You speak Galactic?\"The Solarian said, with a grim smile, \"And why not, since I am notmute?\"\"But these?\" Trevize gestured toward the robots. \\n\\n \"These are robots. They speak our language, as I do. But I amSolarian and hear the hyperspatial communications of the worlds beyondso that I have learned your way of speaking, as have my predecessors. Mypredecessors have left descriptions of the language, but I constantlyhear new words and expressions that change with the years, as though youSettlers can settle worlds, but not words. How is it you are surprisedat my understanding of your language?\"\"I should not have been,\" said Trevize. \"I apologize. It was justthat speaking to the robots, I had not thought to hear Galactic onthis world.\"He studied the Solarian. He was wearing a thin white robe, drapedloosely over his shoulder, with large openings for his arms. It was openin front, exposing a bare chest and loincloth below. Except for a pairof light sandals, he wore nothing else. \\n\\n It occurred to Trevize that he could not tell whether the Solarianwas male or female. The breasts were male certainly but the chest washairless and the thin loincloth showed no bulge of any kind. \\n\\n He turned to Bliss and said in a low voice, \"This might still be arobot, but very like a human being in \"Bliss said, her lips hardly moving, \"The mind is that of a human being,not a robot.\"The Solarian said, \"Yet you have not answered my original question. Ishall excuse the failure and put it down to your surprise. I now ask againand you must not fail a second time. What would you with my robots?\"Trevize said, \"We are travelers who seek information to reach ourdestination. We asked your robots for information that would help us,but they lacked the knowledge.\"\"What is the information you seek? Perhaps I can help you.\"\"We seek the location of Earth. Could you tell us that?\"The Solarian\u0027s eyebrows lifted. \"I would have thought that yourfirst object of curiosity would have been myself. I will supply thatinformation although you have not asked for it. I am Sarton Bander andyou stand upon the Bander estate, which stretches as far as your eye cansee in every direction and far beyond. I cannot say that you are welcomehere, for in coming here, you have violated a trust. You are the firstSettlers to touch down upon Solaria in many thousands of years and, asit turns out, you have come here merely to inquire as to the best wayof reaching another world. In the old days, Settlers, you and your shipwould have been destroyed on sight.\"\"That would be a barbaric way of treating people who mean no harmand offer none,\" said Trevize cautiously. \\n\\n \"I agree, but when members of an expanding society set foot upon aninoffensive and static one, that mere touch is filled with potentialharm. While we feared that harm, we were ready to destroy those who cameat the instant of their coming. Since we no longer have reason to fear,we are, as you see, ready to talk.\"Trevize said, \"I appreciate the information you have offered us sofreely, and yet you failed to answer the question I did ask. I willrepeat it. Could you tell us the location of the planet Earth?\"\"By Earth, I take it you mean the world on which the human species,and the various species of plants and animals\" his hand movedgracefully about as though to indicate all the surroundings aboutthem \"originated.\"\"Yes, I do, sir.\"A queer look of repugnance flitted over the Solarian\u0027s face. He said,\"Please address me simply as Bander, if you must use a form of address. Donot address me by any word that includes a sign of gender. I am neithermale nor female. I am whole .\"Trevize nodded (he had been right). \"As you wish, Bander. What, then,is the location of Earth, the world of origin of all of us?\"Bander said, \"I do not know. Nor do I wish to know. If I did know,or if I could find out, it would do you no good, for Earth no longerexists as a world. Ah,\" he went on, stretching out his arms. \"Thesun feels good. I am not often on the surface, and never when the sun doesnot show itself. My robots were sent to greet you while the sun was yethiding behind the clouds. I followed only when the clouds cleared.\"\"Why is it that Earth no longer exists as a world?\" said Trevizeinsistently, steeling himself for the tale of radioactivity onceagain. \\n\\n Bander, however, ignored the question or, rather, put it to one sidecarelessly. \"The story is too long,\" he said. \"You told me that you camewith no intent of harm.\"\"That is correct.\"\"Why then did you come armed?\"\"That is merely a precaution. I did not know what I might meet.\"\"It doesn\u0027t matter. Your little weapons represent no danger tome. Yet I am curious. I have, of course, heard much of your arms, andof your curiously barbaric history that seems to depend so entirely uponarms. Even so, I have never actually seen a weapon. May I see yours?\"Trevize took a step backward. \"I\u0027m afraid not, Bander.\"Bander seemed amused. \"I asked only out of politeness. I need nothave asked at all.\"It held out its hand and from Trevize\u0027s right holster, there emergedhis blaster, while from his left holster, there rose up his neuronicwhip. Trevize snatched at his weapons but felt his arms held back asthough by stiffly elastic bonds. Both Pelorat and Bliss started forwardand it was clear that they were held as well. \\n\\n Bander said, \"Don\u0027t bother trying to interfere. You cannot.\" Theweapons flew to its hands and it looked them over carefully. \"This one,\"it said, indicating the blaster, \"seems to be a microwave beamer thatproduces heat, thus exploding any fluid-containing body. The other ismore subtle, and, I must confess, I do not see at a glance what it isintended to do. However, since you mean no harm and offer no harm, youdon\u0027t need arms. I can, and I do, bleed the energy content of the unitsof each weapon. That leaves them harmless unless you use one or the otheras a club, and they would be clumsy indeed if used for that purpose.\"The Solarian released the weapons and again they drifted throughthe air, this time back toward Trevize. Each settled neatly into itsholster. \\n\\n Trevize, feeling himself released, pulled out his blaster, but therewas no need to use it. The contact hung loosely, and the energy unithad clearly been totally drained. That was precisely the case with theneuronic whip as well. \\n\\n He looked up at Bander, who said, smiling, \"You are quite helpless,Outworlder. I can as easily, if I so desired, destroy your ship and,of course, you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630/48242.html","bookId":5,"book":{"id":5,"title":"基地系列 Foundation and Earth 基地与地球","description":"简介： 基地纪元498年。银河未来的命运决定于某人一念之间，这个就是葛兰崔维兹。他必须在第一基地，第二基地与盖娅之间做出银河未来由谁主导的决定：由第一基地创建的新帝国将会逞领银河进入科技昌明的世纪，却会像第一帝国那样摧毁在战争之中；由第二基地指导的新帝国将能确...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201608/24/13-41-46-87-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1630","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
