{"id":8878,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 7: Troubles Ahead.","content":"When Dr. Burke had left, Bob broke into an Indian war dance, expressive of the deepest satisfaction; and Captain O\u0027Halloran burst into a shout of laughter at the contrast between the boy\u0027s vehement delight, and the dissatisfaction expressed in his wife\u0027s face. \"I am not at all pleased, Gerald, not at all; and I don\u0027t see that it is any laughing matter. I never heard a more ridiculous thing. Uncle intrusted Bob to our care, believing that we should do what was best for him; and here you go and engage the most feather-headed Irishman in the garrison--and that is saying a good deal, Gerald--to look after him.\" It was so seldom that Carrie took matters seriously that her husband ceased laughing, at once. \"Well, Carrie, there is no occasion to put yourself out about it. The experiment can be tried for a fortnight; and if, at the end of that time, you are not satisfied, we will get someone else. But I am sure it will work well.\" \"So am I, Carrie,\" Bob put in. \"I believe Dr. Burke and I will get on splendidly. You see, I have been with two people, both of whom looked as grave as judges, and one of them as cross as a bear; and yet they were both first-rate fellows. It seems to me that Dr. Burke is just the other way. He turns everything into fun; but I expect he will be just as sharp, when he is at lessons, as anyone else. At any rate, you may be sure that I will do my best with him; so as not to get put under some stiff old fellow, instead of him.\" \"Well, we shall see, Bob. I hope that it will turn out well, I am sure.\" \"Of course it will turn out well, Carrie. Why, didn\u0027t your uncle at first think I was the most harum-scarum fellow he ever saw; and now he sees that I am a downright model husband, with only one fault, and that is that I let you have your own way, altogether.\" \"It looks like it, on the present occasion, Gerald,\" his wife laughed. \"I will give it, as you say, a fortnight\u0027s trial. I only hope that you have made a better choice for Bob\u0027s Spanish master.\" \"I hope so, my dear--that is, if it is possible. The professor, as I call him, has been teaching his language to officers, here, for the last thirty years. He is a queer, wizened-up little old chap, and has got out of the way of bowing and scraping that the senors generally indulge in; but he seems a cheery little old soul, and he has got to understand English ways and, at any rate, there is no fear of his leading Bob into mischief. The Spaniards don\u0027t understand that; and if you were to ruffle his dignity, he would throw up teaching him at once; and I have not heard of another man on the Rock who would be likely to suit.\" On the following Monday, Bob began work with the professor; who called himself, on his card, Don Diaz Martos. He spoke English very fairly and, after the first half hour, Bob found that the lessons would be much more pleasant than he expected. The professor began by giving him a long sentence to learn by heart, thoroughly; and when Bob had done this, parsed each word with him, so that he perfectly understood its meaning. Then he made the lad say it after him a score of times, correcting his accent and inflection; and when he was satisfied with this, began to construct fresh sentences out of the original one, again making Bob repeat them, and form fresh ones himself. Thus, by the time the first lesson was finished the lad, to his surprise, found himself able, without difficulty, to frame sentences from the words he had learned. Then the professor wrote down thirty nouns and verbs in common use. \"You will learn them this evening,\" he said, \"and in the morning we shall be able to make up a number of sentences out of them and, by the end of a week, you will see we shall begin to talk to each other. After that, it will be easy. Thirty fresh words, every day, will be ample. In a month you will know seven or eight hundred; and seven or eight hundred are enough for a man to talk with, on common occasions.\" \"He is first rate,\" Bob reported to his sister, as they sat down to dinner, at one o\u0027clock. \"You would hardly believe that I can say a dozen little sentences, already; and can understand him, when he says them. He says, in a week, we shall be able to get to talk together. \"I wonder they don\u0027t teach Latin like that. Why, I shall know in two or three months as much Spanish--and more, ever so much more--than I do Latin, after grinding away at it for the last seven or eight years.\" \"Well, that is satisfactory. I only hope the other will turn out as well.\" As Mrs. O\u0027Halloran sat that evening, with her work in her hand, on the terrace; with her husband, smoking a cigar, beside her. She paused, several times, as she heard a burst of laughter. \"That doesn\u0027t sound like master and pupil,\" she said, sharply, after an unusually loud laugh from below. \"More the pity, Carrie. Why on earth shouldn\u0027t a master be capable of a joke? Do you think one does not learn all the faster, when the lecture is pleasant? I know I would, myself. I never could see why a man should look as if he was going to an execution, when he wants to instil knowledge.\" \"But it is not usual, Gerald,\" Carrie remonstrated, no other argument occurring to her. \"But that doesn\u0027t prove that it\u0027s wrong. Why a boy should be driven worse than a donkey, and thrashed until his life is a burden to him, and he hates his lessons and hates his master, beats me entirely. Some day they will go more sensibly to work. \"You see, in the old times, Carrie, men used to beat their wives; and you don\u0027t think the women were any the better for it, do you?\" \"Of course they weren\u0027t,\" Carrie said, indignantly. \"But it was usual, you know, Carrie, just as you say that it is usual for masters to beat boys--as if they would do nothing, without being thrashed. I can\u0027t see any difference between the two things.\" \"I can see a great deal of difference, sir!\" \"Well, what is the difference, Carrie?\" But Carrie disdained to give any answer. Still, as she sat sewing and thinking the matter over, she acknowledged to herself that she really could not see any good and efficient reason why boys should be beaten, any more than women. \"But women don\u0027t do bad things, like boys,\" she said, breaking silence at last. \"Don\u0027t they, Carrie? I am not so sure of that. I have heard of women who are always nagging their husbands, and giving them no peace of their lives. I have heard of women who think of nothing but dress, and who go about and leave their homes and children to shift for themselves. I have heard of women who spend all their time spreading scandal. I have heard of--\" \"There, that is enough,\" Carrie broke in hastily. \"But you don\u0027t mean to say that they would be any the better for beating, Gerald?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Carrie; I should think perhaps they might be, sometimes. At any rate, I think that they deserve a beating quite as much as a boy does, for neglecting to learn a lesson or for playing some prank--which comes just as naturally, to him, as mischief does to a kitten. For anything really bad, I would beat a boy as long as I could stand over him. For lying, or thieving, or any mean, dirty trick I would have no mercy on him. But that is a very different thing to keeping the cane always going, at school, as they do now. \"But here comes Bob. Well, Bob, is the doctor gone? Didn\u0027t you ask him to come up, and have a cigar?\" \"Yes; but he said he had got two or three cases at the hospital he must see, and would wait until this evening.\" \"How have you got on, Bob?\" \"Splendidly. I wonder why they don\u0027t teach at school, like that.\" \"It didn\u0027t sound much like teaching,\" Carrie said, severely. \"I don\u0027t suppose it did, Carrie; but it was teaching, for all that. Why, I have learned as much, this evening, as I did in a dozen lessons, in school. He explains everything so that you seem to understand it, at once; and he puts things, sometimes, in such a droll way, and brings in such funny comparisons, that you can\u0027t help laughing. But you understand it, for all that, and are not likely to forget it. \"Don\u0027t you be afraid, Carrie. If Dr. Burke teaches me, for the two years that I am going to be here, I shall know more than I should have done if I had stopped at Tulloch\u0027s till I was an old man. I used to learn lessons, there, and get through them, somehow, but I don\u0027t think I ever understood why things were so; while Dr. Burke explains everything so that you seem to understand all about it, at once. And he is pretty sharp, too. He takes a tremendous lot of pains, himself; but I can see he will expect me to take a tremendous lot of pains, too.\" At the end of a fortnight, Carrie made no allusion to the subject of a change of masters. The laughing downstairs still scandalized her, a little; but she saw that Bob really enjoyed his lessons and, although she herself could not test what progress he was making, his assurances on that head satisfied her. The Brilliant had sailed on a cruise, the morning after Bob\u0027s arrival; but as soon as he heard that she had again dropped anchor in the bay, he took a boat and went out to her; and returned on shore with Jim Sankey, who had obtained leave for the afternoon. The two spent hours in rambling about the Rock, and talking of old times at Tulloch\u0027s. Both agreed that the most fortunate thing that ever happened had been the burglary at Admiral Langton\u0027s; which had been the means of Jim\u0027s getting into the navy, and Bob\u0027s coming out to Gibraltar, to his sister. Jim had lots to tell of his shipmates, and his life on board the Brilliant. He was disposed to pity Bob spending half his day at lessons; and was astonished to find that his friend really enjoyed it, and still more that he should already have begun to pick up a little Spanish. \"You can\u0027t help it, with Don Diaz,\" Bob said. \"He makes you go over a sentence, fifty times, until you say it in exactly the same voice he does--I mean the same accent. He says it slow, at first, so that I can understand him; and then faster and faster, till he speaks in his regular voice. Then I have to make up another sentence, in answer. It is good fun, I can tell you; and yet one feels that one is getting on very fast. I thought it would take years before I should be able to get on anyhow in Spanish; but he says if I keep on sticking to it, I shall be able to speak pretty nearly like a native, in six months\u0027 time. I quite astonish Manola--that is our servant--by firing off sentences in Spanish at her. My sister Carrie says she shall take to learning with the Don, too.\" \"Have you had any fun since you landed, Bob?\" \"No; not regular fun, you know. It has been very jolly. I go down with Gerald--Carrie\u0027s husband, you know--to the barracks, and I know most of the officers of his regiment now, and I walk about a bit by myself; but I have not gone beyond the Rock, yet.\" \"You must get a long day\u0027s leave, Bob; and we will go across the neutral ground, into Spain, together.\" \"Gerald said that, as I was working so steadily, I might have a holiday, sometimes, if I did not ask for it too often. I have been three weeks at it, now. I am sure I can go for a day, when I like, so it will depend on you.\" \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t be able to come ashore for another four or five days, after having got away this afternoon. Let us see, this is Wednesday, I will try to get leave for Monday.\" \"Have you heard, Jim, there is a talk about Spanish troops moving down here, and that they think Spain is going to join France and try to take this place?\" \"No, I haven\u0027t heard a word about it,\" Jim said, opening his eyes. \"You don\u0027t really mean it?\" \"Yes, that is what the officers say. Of course, they don\u0027t know for certain; but there is no doubt the country people have got the idea into their heads, and the natives on the Rock certainly believe it.\" \"Hooray! That would be fun,\" Jim said. \"We have all been grumbling, on board the frigate, at being stuck down here without any chance of picking up prizes; or of falling in with a Frenchman, except we go on a cruise. Why, you have seen twice as much fun as we have, though you only came out in a trader. Except that we chased a craft that we took for a French privateer, we haven\u0027t seen an enemy since we came out from England; and we didn\u0027t see much of her, for she sailed right away from us. While you have had no end of fighting, and a very narrow escape of being taken to a French prison.\" \"Too narrow to be pleasant, Jim. I don\u0027t think there would be much fun to be got out of a French prison.\" \"I don\u0027t know, Bob. I suppose it would be dull, if you were alone; but if you and I were together, I feel sure we should have some fun, and should make our escape, somehow.\" \"Well, we might try,\" Bob said, doubtfully. \"But you see, not many fellows do make their escape; and as sailors are up to climbing ropes, and getting over walls, and all that sort of thing, I should think they would do it, if it could be managed anyhow.\" Upon the following day--when Bob was in the anteroom of the mess with Captain O\u0027Halloran, looking at some papers that had been brought by a ship that had come in that morning--the colonel entered, accompanied by Captain Langton. The officers all stood up, and the colonel introduced them to Captain Langton--who was, he told them, going to dine at the mess that evening. After he had done this, Captain Langton\u0027s eye fell upon Bob; who smiled, and made a bow. \"I ought to know you,\" the captain said. \"I have certainly seen your face somewhere.\" \"It was at Admiral Langton\u0027s, sir. My name is Bob Repton.\" \"Of course it is,\" the officer said, shaking him cordially by the hand. \"But what on earth are you doing here? I thought you had settled down somewhere in the city; with an uncle, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes, sir; but I have come out here to learn Spanish.\" \"Have you seen your friend Sankey?\" \"Yes, sir. I went on board the frigate to see him, yesterday afternoon; and he got leave to come ashore with me, for two or three hours.\" \"He ought to have let me know that you were here,\" the captain said. \"Who are you staying with, lad?\" \"With Captain O\u0027Halloran, sir, my brother-in-law,\" Bob said, indicating Gerald, who had already been introduced to Captain Langton. \"I daresay you are surprised at my knowing this young gentleman,\" he said, turning to Colonel Cochrane, \"but he did my father, the admiral, a great service. He and three other lads, under his leadership, captured four of the most notorious burglars in London, when they were engaged in robbing my father\u0027s house. It was a most gallant affair, I can assure you; and the four burglars swung for it, a couple of months later. I have one of the lads as a midshipman, on board my ship; and I offered a berth to Repton but, very wisely, he decided to remain on shore, where his prospects were good.\" \"Why, O\u0027Halloran, you never told me anything about this,\" the colonel said. \"No, sir. Bob asked me not to say anything about it. I think he is rather shy of having it talked about; and it is the only thing of which he is shy as far as I have discovered.\" \"Well, we must hear the story,\" the colonel said. \"I hope you will dine at mess, this evening, and bring him with you. He shall tell us the story over our wine. I am curious to know how four boys can have made such a capture.\" After mess that evening Bob told the story, as modestly as he could. \"There, colonel,\" Captain Langton said, when he had finished. \"You see that, if these stories I hear are true, and the Spaniards are going to make a dash for Gibraltar, you have got a valuable addition to your garrison.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" the colonel laughed. \"We will make a volunteer of him. He has had some little experience of standing fire, for O\u0027Halloran told me that the brig he came out in had fought a sharp action with a privateer of superior force; and indeed, when she came in here, her sails were riddled with shot holes.\" \"Better and better,\" Captain Langton laughed. \"Well, Repton, remember whenever you are disposed for a cruise, I shall be glad to take you as passenger. Sankey will make you at home in the midshipmen\u0027s berth. If the Spaniards declare war with us, we shall have stirring times at sea, as well as on shore and, though you won\u0027t get any share in any prize money we may win, while you are on board, you will have part of the honour; and you see, making captures is quite in your line.\" The next day, Captain O\u0027Halloran and Bob dined on board the Brilliant. Captain Langton introduced the lad to his officers, telling them that he wished him to be considered as being free on board the ship, whether he himself happened to be on board or not, when he came off. \"But you must keep an eye on him, Mr. Hardy, while he is on board,\" he said to the first lieutenant. \"Mr. Sankey,\" and he nodded at Jim, who was among those invited, \"is rather a pickle, but from what I hear Repton is worse. So you will have to keep a sharp eye upon them, when they are together; and if they are up to mischief, do not hesitate to masthead both of them. A passenger on board one of His Majesty\u0027s ships is amenable to discipline, like anyone else.\" \"I will see to it, sir,\" the lieutenant said, laughing. \"Sankey knows the way up, already.\" \"Yes. I think I observed him taking a view of the shore from that elevation, this morning.\" Jim coloured hotly. \"Yes, sir,\" the lieutenant said. \"The doctor made a complaint that his leeches had got out of their bottle, and were all over the ship; and I fancy one of them got into his bed, somehow. He had given Mr. Sankey a dose of physic in the morning; and remembered afterwards that, while he was making up the medicine, Sankey had been doing something in the corner where his bottles were. When I questioned Sankey about it, he admitted that he had observed the leeches, but declined to criminate himself farther. So I sent him aloft for an hour or two, to meditate upon the enormity of wasting His Majesty\u0027s medical stores.\" \"I hope, Captain O\u0027Halloran,\" the captain said, \"that you have less trouble with your brother-in-law than we have with his friend.\" \"Bob hasn\u0027t had much chance, yet,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said, laughing. \"He is new to the place, as yet; and besides, he is really working hard, and hasn\u0027t much time for mischief; but I don\u0027t flatter myself that it is going to last.\" \"Well, Mr. Sankey, you may as well take your friend down, and introduce him formally to your messmates,\" the captain said; and Jim, who had been feeling extremely uncomfortable since the talk had turned on the subject of mastheading, rose and made his escape with Bob, leaving the elders to their wine. The proposed excursion to the Spanish lines did not come off, as the Brilliant put to sea again, on the day fixed for it. She was away a fortnight and, on her return, the captain issued orders that none of the junior officers, when allowed leave, were to go beyond the lines; for the rumours of approaching troubles had become stronger and, as the peasantry were assuming a somewhat hostile attitude, any act of imprudence might result in trouble. Jim often had leave to come ashore in the afternoon and, as this was the time that Bob had to himself, they wandered together all over the Rock, climbed up the flagstaff, and made themselves acquainted with all the paths and precipices. Their favourite place was the back of the Rock; where the cliff, in many places, fell sheer away for hundreds of feet down into the sea. They had many discussions as to the possibility of climbing up on that side, though both agreed that it would be impossible to climb down. \"I should like to try, awfully,\" Bob said, one day early in June, as they were leaning on a low wall looking down to the sea. \"But it would never do to risk getting into a scrape here. It wouldn\u0027t, indeed, Bob. They don\u0027t understand jokes at Gib. One would be had up before the big wigs, and court-martialled, and goodness knows what. Of course, it is jolly being ashore; but one never gets rid of the idea that one is a sort of prisoner. There are the regulations about what time you may come off, and what time the gate is closed and, if you are a minute late, there you are until next morning. Whichever way one turns there are sentries; and you can\u0027t pass one way, and you can\u0027t go back another way, and there are some of the batteries you can\u0027t go into, without a special order. It never would do to try any nonsense, here. \"Look at that sentry up there. I expect he has got his eye on us, now; and if he saw us trying to get down, he would take us for deserters and fire. There wouldn\u0027t be any fear of his hitting us; but the nearest guard would turn out, and we should be arrested and reported, and all sorts of things. It wouldn\u0027t matter so much for you, but I should get my leave stopped altogether, and should get into the captain\u0027s black books. \"No, no. I don\u0027t mind running a little risk of breaking my neck, but not here on the Rock. I would rather get into ten scrapes, on board the frigate, than one here.\" \"Yes, I suppose it can\u0027t be done,\" Bob agreed; \"but I should have liked to swing myself down to one of those ledges. There would be such a scolding and shrieking among the birds.\" \"Yes, that would be fun; but as it might bring on the same sort of row among the authorities, I would rather leave it alone. \"I expect we shall soon get leave to go across the lines again. There doesn\u0027t seem to be any chance of a row with the dons; I expect it was all moonshine, from the first. Why, they say Spain is trying to patch up the quarrel between us and France. She would not be doing that, if she had any idea of going to war with us, herself.\" \"I don\u0027t know, Jim. Gerald and Dr. Burke were talking it over last night, and Gerald said just what you do; and then Dr. Burke said: \"\u0027You are wrong, entirely, Gerald. That is just the dangerous part of the affair. Why should Spain want to put a stop to the war between us and the frog eaters? Sure, wouldn\u0027t she look on with the greatest pleasure in life, while we cut each other\u0027s throats and blew up each other\u0027s ships, and put all the trade of the Mediterranean into her hands? Why, it is the very thing that suits her best.\u0027 \"\u0027Then what is she after putting herself forward for, Teddy?\u0027 Gerald said. \"\u0027Because she wants to have a finger in the pie, Gerald. It wouldn\u0027t be dacent for her to say to England: \"\u0027\"It is in a hole you are, at present, wid your hands full; and so I am going to take the opportunity of pitching into you.\" \"\u0027So she begins by stipping forward as the dear friend of both parties; and she says: \"\u0027\"What are you breaking each other\u0027s heads for, boys? Make up your quarrel, and shake hands.\" \"\u0027Then she sets to and proposes terms--which she knows mighty well we shall never agree to, for the letters we had, the other day said, that it was reported that the proposals of Spain were altogether unacceptable--and then, when we refuse, she turns round and says: \"\u0027\"You have put yourself in the wrong, entirely. I gave you a chance of putting yourself in the right, and it is a grave insult to me for you to refuse to accept my proposals. So there is nothing for me to do, now, but just to join with France, and give you the bating you desarve.\"\u0027 \"That is Teddy Burke\u0027s idea, Jim; and though he is so full of fun, he is awfully clever, and has got no end of sense; and I\u0027d take his opinion about anything. You see how he has got me on, in these four months, in Latin and things. Why, I have learnt more, with him, than I did all the time I was at Tulloch\u0027s. He says most likely the negotiations will be finished, one way or the other, by the middle of this month; and he offered to bet Gerald a gallon of whisky that there would be a declaration of war, by Spain, before the end of the month.\" \"Did he?\" Jim said, in great delight. \"Well, I do hope he is right. We are all getting precious tired, I can assure you, of broiling down there in the harbour. The decks are hot enough to cook a steak upon. When we started, today, we didn\u0027t see a creature in the streets. Everyone had gone off to bed, for two or three hours; and the shops were all closed, as if it had been two o\u0027clock at night, instead of two o\u0027clock in the day. Even the dogs were all asleep, in the shade. I think we shall have to give up our walks, till August is over. It is getting too hot for anything, in the afternoon.\" \"Well, it is hot,\" Bob agreed. \"Carrie said I was mad, coming out in it today; and should get sunstroke, and all sort of things; and Gerald said at dinner that, if it were not against the regulations, he would like to shave his head, instead of plastering it all over with powder.\" \"I call it disgusting,\" Jim said, heartily. \"That is the one thing I envy you in. I shouldn\u0027t like to be grinding away at books, as you do; and you don\u0027t have half the fun I do, on shore here without any fellows to have larks with; but not having to powder your hair almost makes up for it. I don\u0027t mind it, in winter, because it makes a sort of thatch for the head; but it is awful, now. I feel just as if I had got a pudding crust all over my head.\" \"Well, that is appropriate, Jim,\" laughed Bob; and then Jim chased him all along the path, till they got within sight of a sentry in a battery; and then his dignity as midshipman compelled them to desist, and the pair walked gravely down into the town. That evening after lessons were over Dr. Burke, as usual, went up on to the terrace to smoke a cigar with Captain O\u0027Halloran. \"It is a pity altogether, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran,\" he said, as he stood by her side, looking over the moonlit bay, with the dark hulls of the ships and the faint lights across at Algeciras, \"that we can\u0027t do away with the day, and have nothing but night of it, for four or five months in the year. I used to think it must be mighty unpleasant for the Esquimaux; but faith, I envy them now. Fancy five or six months without catching a glimpse of that burning old sun!\" \"I don\u0027t suppose they think so,\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran laughed, \"but it would be pleasant here. The heat has been dreadful, all day; and it is really only after sunset that one begins to enjoy life.\" \"You may well say that, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran. Faith, I wish they would let me take off my coat, and do my work in my shirtsleeves down at the hospital. Sure, it is a strange idea these military men have got in their heads, that a man isn\u0027t fit for work unless he is buttoned so tightly up to the chin that he is red in the face. If nature had meant it, we should have been born in a suit of scale armour, like a crocodile. \"Well, there is one consolation--if there is a siege, I expect there will be an end of hair powder and cravats. It\u0027s the gineral rule, on a campaign; and it is worth standing to be shot at, to have a little comfort in one\u0027s life.\" \"Do you think that there is any chance at all of the Spaniards taking the place, if they do besiege us?\" Bob asked, as Dr. Burke took his seat. \"None of taking the place by force, Bob. It has been besieged, over and over again; and it is pretty nearly always by hunger that it has fallen. That is where the pinch will come, if they besiege us in earnest: it\u0027s living on mice and grass you are like to be, before it is over.\" \"But the fleet will bring in provisions, surely, Dr. Burke?\" \"The fleet will have all it can do to keep the sea, against the navies of France and Spain. They will do what they can, you may be sure; but the enemy well know that it is only by starving us out that they can hope to take the place, and I expect they will put such a fleet here that it will be mighty difficult for even a boat to find its way in between them.\" \"Do you know about the other sieges?\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran asked. \"Of course, I know something about the last siege; but I know nothing about the history of the Rock before that, and of course Gerald doesn\u0027t know.\" \"And why should I, Carrie? You don\u0027t suppose that when I was at school, at Athlone, they taught me the history of every bit of rock sticking up on the face of the globe? I had enough to do to learn about the old Romans--bad cess to them, and all their bothering doings!\" \"I can tell you about it, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran,\" Teddy Burke said. \"Bob\u0027s professor, who comes to have a talk with me for half an hour every day, has been telling me all about it; and if Gerald will move himself, and mix me a glass of grog to moisten my throat, I will give you the whole story of it. \"You know, no doubt, that it was called Mount Calpe, by Gerald\u0027s friends the Romans; who called the hill opposite there Mount Abyla, and the two together the Pillars of Hercules. But beyond giving it a name, they don\u0027t seem to have concerned themselves with it; nor do the Phoenicians or Carthaginians, though all of them had cities out in the low country. \"It was when the Saracens began to play their games over here that we first hear of it. Roderic, you know, was king of the Goths, and seems to have been a thundering old tyrant; and one of his nobles, Julian--who had been badly treated by him--went across with his family into Africa, and put up Mousa, the Saracen governor of the province across there, to invade Spain. They first of all made a little expedition--that was in 711--with one hundred horse, and four hundred foot. They landed over there at Algeciras and, after doing some plundering and burning, sailed back again, with the news that the country could be conquered. So next year twelve thousand men, under a chief named Tarik, crossed and landed on the flat between the Rock and Spain. He left a party here to build the castle; and then marched away, defeated Roderic and his army at Xeres, and soon conquered the whole of Spain, except the mountains of the north. \"We don\u0027t hear much more of Gibraltar for another six hundred years. Algeciras had become a fortress of great strength and magnificence, and Gibraltar was a mere sort of outlying post. Ferdinand the Fourth of Spain besieged Algeciras for years, and could not take it; but a part of his army attacked Gibraltar, and captured it. The African Moors came over to help their friends, and Ferdinand had to fall back; but the Spaniards still held Gibraltar--a chap named Vasco Paez de Meira being in command. \"In 1333 Abomelique, son of the Emperor of Fez, came across with an army and besieged Gibraltar. Vasco held out for five months, and was then starved into surrender, just as Alonzo the Eleventh was approaching to his assistance. He arrived before the town, five days after it surrendered, and attacked the castle; but the Moors encamped on the neutral ground in his rear, and cut him off from his supplies; and he was obliged at last to negotiate, and was permitted to retire. He was not long away. Next time he attacked Algeciras; which, after a long siege, he took in 1343. \"In 1349 there were several wars in Africa, and he took advantage of this to besiege Gibraltar. He was some months over the business, and the garrison were nearly starved out; when pestilence broke out in the Spanish camp, by which the king and many of his soldiers died, and the rest retired. \"It was not until sixty years afterwards, in 1410, that there were fresh troubles; and then they were what might be called family squabbles. The Africans of Fez had held the place, till then; but the Moorish king of Grenada suddenly advanced upon it, and took it. A short time afterwards, the inhabitants rose against the Spanish Moors, and turned them out, and the Emperor of Morocco sent over an army to help them; but the Moors of Grenada besieged the place, and took it by famine. \"In 1435 the Christians had another slap at it; but Henry de Guzman, who attacked by sea, was defeated and killed. In 1462 the greater part of the garrison of Gibraltar was withdrawn to take part in some civil shindy, that was going on at Grenada; and in their absence the place was taken by John de Guzman, duke of Medina-Sidonia, and son of the Henry that was killed. In 1540 Gibraltar was surprised and pillaged by one of Barossa\u0027s captains; but as he was leaving some Christian galleys met him, and the corsairs were all killed or taken. \"This was really the only affair worth speaking of between 1462, when it fell into the hands of the Spaniards, and 1704, when it was captured by us. Sir George Rooke, who had gone out with a force to attack Cadiz--finding that there was not much chance of success in that direction--resolved, with Prince George of Hesse and Darmstadt--who commanded the troops on board the fleet--to make an attack on Gibraltar. \"On the 21st of July, 1704, the English and Dutch landed on the neutral ground and, at daybreak on the 23rd, the fleet opened fire. The Spaniards were driven from their guns on the Molehead Battery. The boats landed, and seized the battery, and held it in spite of the Spaniards springing a mine, which killed two lieutenants and about forty men. The Marquis de Salines, the governor, was then summoned, and capitulated. So you see, we made only a day\u0027s work of taking a place which the Spaniards thought that they had made impregnable. The professor made a strong point of it that the garrison consisted only of a hundred and fifty men; which certainly accounts for our success, for it is no use having guns and walls, if you haven\u0027t got soldiers to man them. \"The Prince of Hesse was left as governor; and it was not long before his mettle was tried for, in October, the Spanish army, with six battalions of Frenchmen, opened trenches against the town. Admiral Sir John Leake threw in reinforcements, and six months\u0027 provisions. At the end of the month, a forlorn hope of five hundred Spanish volunteers managed to climb up the Rock, by ropes and ladders, and surprised a battery; but were so furiously attacked that they were all killed, or taken prisoners. A heavy cannonade was kept up for another week, when a large number of transports with reinforcements and supplies arrived and, the garrison being now considered strong enough to resist any attack, the fleet sailed away. \"The siege went on till the middle of March, when Sir John Leake again arrived, drove away the French fleet, and captured or burnt five of them; and the siege was then discontinued, having cost the enemy ten thousand men. So, you see, there was some pretty hard fighting over it. \"The place was threatened in 1720 and, in the beginning of 1727, twenty thousand Spaniards again sat down before it. The fortifications had been made a good deal stronger, after the first siege; and the garrison was commanded by Lieutenant Governor Clayton. The siege lasted till May, when news arrived that the preliminaries of a general peace had been signed. There was a lot of firing; but the Spaniards must have shot mighty badly, for we had only three hundred killed and wounded. You would think that that was enough; but when I tell you that the cannon were so old and rotten that seventy cannon, and thirty mortars, burst during the siege, it seems to me that every one of those three hundred must have been damaged by our own cannon, and that the Spaniards did not succeed in hitting a single man. \"That is mighty encouraging for you, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran; for I don\u0027t think that our cannon will burst this time and, if the Spaniards do not shoot better than they did before, it is little work, enough, that is likely to fall to the share of the surgeons.\" \"Thank you,\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran said. \"You have told that very nicely, Teddy Burke. I did not know anything about it, before; and I had some idea that it was when the English were besieged here that the Queen of Spain sat on that rock which is called after her; but I see now that it was Ferdinand\u0027s Isabella, and that it was when the Moors were besieged here, hundreds of years before. \"Well, I am glad I know something about it. It is stupid to be in a place, and know nothing of its history. You are rising in my estimation fast, Dr. Burke.\" \"Mistress O\u0027Halloran,\" the doctor said, rising and making a deep bow, \"you overwhelm me, entirely; and now I must say goodnight, for I must look in at the hospital, before I turn in to my quarters.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3143/86376.html","bookId":813,"book":{"id":813,"title":"Held Fast For England","description":"简介： The Siege of Gibraltar stands almost alone in the annals of warfare, alike in its duration and in the immense preparations made, by the united powers of France and Spain, for the capture of the fortress.
