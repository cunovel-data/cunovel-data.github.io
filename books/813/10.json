{"id":8880,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 9: The Antelope.","content":"On the 3rd of July, a hundred and eighty volunteers from the infantry joined the artillery, who were not numerous enough to work all the guns of the batteries; and two days later a Spanish squadron of two men-of-war, five frigates, and eleven smaller vessels hove in sight from the west, and lay to off the entrance to the bay. Three privateers came in, and one of the Spanish schooners stood across to reconnoitre them; and a shot was fired at her from the batteries on Europa Point. The Enterprise, frigate, had gone across to Tetuan to bring Mr. Logie over again. On her return, she was chased by the enemy\u0027s squadron; but succeeded in giving them the slip, in the dark. As she neared the Rock the captain, fearing to be discovered by the enemy, did not show the usual lights; and several shots were fired at the ship, but fortunately without effect. On the following day letters were received from England, with the official news that hostilities had commenced between Great Britain and Spain; and the same evening a proclamation was published authorizing the capture of Spanish vessels, and letters of marque were given to the privateers in the bay, permitting them to capture Spanish as well as French vessels. Among the privateers was the Antelope, which was one of those that had come in on the previous afternoon. Bob had not heard of her arrival, when he ran against Captain Lockett in the town, next morning. They had not met since Bob had landed, six months before. \"Well, Master Repton,\" the captain said, after they had shaken hands, \"I was coming up to see you, after I had managed my business. I have letters, from Mr. Bale, for you and Mrs. O\u0027Halloran.\" \"You are all well on board, I hope, captain?\" \"Joe is well. He is first mate, now. Poor Probert is on his back in hospital, at Portsmouth. We had a sharp brush with a French privateer, but we beat her off. We had five men killed, and Probert had his leg taken off by an eighteen pound shot. We clapped on a tourniquet, but he had a very narrow escape of bleeding to death. Fortunately it was off Ushant and, the wind being favourable, we got into Portsmouth on the following morning; and the doctors think that they will pull him round. \"You have grown a good bit, since I saw you last.\" \"Not much, I am afraid,\" Bob replied dolefully, for his height was rather a sore point with him. \"I get wider, but I don\u0027t think I have grown half an inch, since I came here.\" \"And how goes on the Spanish?\" \"First rate. I can get on in it almost as well as in English.\" \"So you are in for some more fighting!\" \"So they say,\" Bob replied, \"but I don\u0027t think I am likely to have as close a shave, of a Spanish prison, as I had of a French one coming out here.\" \"No; we had a narrow squeak of it, that time.\" \"Was war declared when you came away?\" \"No; the negotiations were broken off, and everyone knew that war was certain, and that the proclamation might be issued at any hour. I have not had a very fast run, and expected to have learned the news when I got here; but you are sure to hear it, in a day or two. That was why I came here. Freights were short for, with the ports of France and Spain both closed, there was little enough doing; so the owners agreed to let me drop trading and make straight for Gibraltar, so as to be ready to put out as soon as we get the declaration of war. \"There ought to be some first-rate pickings, along the coast. It isn\u0027t, here, as it is with France; where they have learned to be precious cautious, and where one daren\u0027t risk running in close to their coast on the chance of picking up a prize, for the waters swarm with their privateers. The Spaniards are a very slow set, and there is not much fear of their fitting out many privateers, for months to come; and the coasters will be a long time before they wake up to the fact that Spain is at war with us, and will go lumbering along from port to port, without the least fear of being captured. So it is a rare chance of making prize money. \"If you like a cruise, I shall be very happy to take you with me. I have seen you under fire, you know, and know that you are to be depended upon.\" \"I should like to go, above all things,\" Bob said; \"but I don\u0027t know what my sister would say. I must get at her husband, first. If I can get him on my side, I think I shall be able to manage it with her. \"Well, will you come up to dinner?\" \"No, I shall be busy all day. Here are the letters I was speaking of.\" \"Well, we have supper at seven. Will you come then?\" \"With pleasure.\" \"Will Joe be able to come, too?\" \"No; it wouldn\u0027t do for us both to leave the brig. The Spanish fleet may be sending in their boats, to try and cut some of our vessels out, and I should not feel comfortable if we were both ashore; but he will be very glad to see you, on board. We are anchored a cable length from the Water Port. You are pretty sure to see one of our boats alongside. \"The steward came off with me, to buy some soft tack and fresh meat. I saw him just before I met you. He told me he had got some bread, but that meat was at a ruinous price. I told him that he must get it, whatever price it was, and I expect by this time he has done so; so if you look sharp, you will get to the boat before it puts off with him.\" The steward was in the act of getting into the boat, as Bob ran down. \"Glad to see you, Mister Repton,\" the man said, touching his hat. \"Have you seen the captain, sir?\" \"Yes, I have just left him. He told me I should catch you here.\" \"Thinking of having another cruise with us, sir?\" \"I am thinking about it, Parker, but I don\u0027t know whether I shall be able to manage it.\" They were soon alongside the Antelope. \"I thought it was you, Mister Repton, when I saw you run down to the boat,\" Joe Lockett said, as he shook hands with Bob. \"I am glad to see you again, Joe, and I am glad to hear you are first mate now; though of course, I am sorry for Mr. Probert.\" \"Yes, a bad job for him, a very bad job; but it won\u0027t be so bad, in his case, as in some. He has been talking, for the last two or three voyages, of retiring. An old uncle of his died, and left him a few acres of land down in Essex; and he has saved a bit of money out of his pay, and his share of the prizes we have made; and he talked about giving up the sea, and settling down on shore. So now, he will do it. He said as much as that, the night he was wounded. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 he said, \u0027there won\u0027t be any more trouble about making up my mind, Joe. If I do get over this job, I have got to lay up as a dismantled hulk, for the rest of my life. I have been talking of it to you, but I doubt whether I should ever have brought myself to it, if it had not been for them Frenchmen\u0027s shot.\u0027 \"Well, will you come into the cabin, and take something?\" \"No, thank you, Joe.\" \"Have they got the news about the declaration of war yet, Mister Repton?\" \"No, it hasn\u0027t arrived yet.\" \"I expect we shall get some good pickings along the coast, directly it comes. We have been trading regularly, this last year; and we all of us want the chance of earning a bit of prize money. So I can tell you, we were very glad when we heard that we were going to take to that again, for a bit.\" \"Yes, the captain was telling me about it, and he has asked me to go for a trip with you.\" \"Well, I hope that you will be able to come, Mister Repton.\" \"I hope so, Joe. But there is one thing--if I do come, you must call me Bob. I hate being called Mister Repton.\" \"Well, it would be different if you come with us like that,\" the young mate said. \"You see, you were a passenger, before; but if you came like this, you will be here as a friend, like. So it will come natural to call you Bob. \"And how do you like the place?\" \"Oh, I like it well enough! I have been working very hard--at least, pretty hard--so I haven\u0027t had time to feel it dull; and of course I know all the officers in my brother-in-law\u0027s regiment. But I shall be very glad, indeed, of a cruise; especially as we are likely presently, by all they say, to be cut off here--some say for months, some say for years.\" \"But still, I expect there will be some lively work,\" the mate said, \"if the Spaniards really mean to try and take this place.\" \"They will never take it,\" Bob said, \"unless they are able to starve us out; and they ought not to be able to do that. Ships ought to be able to run in from the east, at any time; for the Spaniards dare not come across within range of the guns and, if the wind was strong, they could not get out from their side of the bay.\" \"That is true enough, and I expect you will find fast-sailing craft--privateers, and such like--will dodge in and out; but a merchantman won\u0027t like to venture over this side of the Straits, but will keep along the Moorish coasts. You see, they can\u0027t keep along the Spanish side without the risk of being picked up, by the gunboats and galleys with the blockading fleet. There are a dozen small craft lying over there, now, with the men-of-war. \"Still, I don\u0027t say none of them will make their way in here, because I daresay they will. They well know they will get big prices for their goods, if they can manage to run the blockade. We are safe to pick up some of the native craft, and bring them in; and so will the other privateers. I expect there will be a good many down here, before long. The worst of it is, there won\u0027t be any sale for the craft we capture.\" \"Except for firewood, Joe. That is one of the things I have heard we are sure to run very short of, if there is a long siege.\" \"Well, that will be something and, of course, any prizes we take laden with things likely to be useful, and sell here, we shall bring in; but the rest we shall have to send over to the other side, so as to be out of sight of their fleet, and then take them straight back to England. \"You see, we have shipped twice as many hands as we had on the voyage when you were with us. We had only a trader\u0027s crew, then; now we have a privateer\u0027s. \"Look there! There is a craft making in from the south. It is like enough she has got the despatches on board. There are two or three of those small Spanish craft getting under sail, to cut her off; but they won\u0027t do it. They could not head her, without getting under the fire of the guns of those batteries, on the point.\" \"Well, I will go ashore now, Joe, if you will let me have the boat. The captain is going to have supper with us, tonight. I wanted you to come too, but he said you could not both come on shore, together. I hope we shall see you tomorrow.\" On landing, Bob made his way to the barrack, so as to intercept Gerald when he came off duty. \"Look here, Gerald,\" he said, when Captain O\u0027Halloran came out of the orderly room, \"I want you to back me up.\" \"Oh, you do? Then I am quite sure that you are up to some mischief or other, Bob, or you wouldn\u0027t want me to help you with Carrie.\" \"It is not mischief at all, Gerald. The Antelope came in last night, and I saw Captain Lockett this morning, and I have asked him to come to supper.\" \"Well, that is all right, Bob. We have plenty of food, at present.\" \"Yes, but that is not it, Gerald. He has invited me to go for a cruise with him. He is going to pick up some prizes, along the Spanish coast.\" \"Oh, that is it, is it? Well, you know very well Carrie won\u0027t let you go.\" \"Well, why shouldn\u0027t I, Gerald? You know that I have been working very well, here; and I am sure I have learnt as much Spanish, in six months, as uncle expected me to learn in two years--besides lots of Latin, and other things, from the doctor. Now, I do think that I have earned a holiday. A fellow at school always has a holiday. I am sure I have worked as hard as I did at school. I think it only fair that I should have a holiday. Besides, you see, I am past sixteen now and, being out here, I think I ought to have the chance of any fun there is; especially as we may be shut up here for ever so long.\" \"Well, there may be something in that, Bob. You certainly have stuck at it well; and you have not got into a single scrape since you came out, which is a deal more than I expected of you.\" \"Besides, you see, Gerald, if I had not made up my mind to stick to uncle\u0027s business, I might have been on board the Brilliant now, with Jim Sankey; and I think, after my giving up that chance, it would be only fair that I should be allowed to have a cruise, now that there is such a splendid opportunity.\" \"Well, Bob, I will do my best to persuade Carrie to let you go; but as far as you are concerned, you know, she is commanding officer.\" Bob laughed, for he knew well enough that, not only in that but in all other matters, his sister generally had her own way. \"Well, I am very much obliged to you, Gerald. I am sure I should enjoy it, awfully.\" \"Don\u0027t thank me too soon, Bob. You have your sister to manage yet.\" \"Oh, we ought to be able to manage her, between us!\" Bob said, confidently. \"Look how you managed to have Dr. Burke for me, and you know how well that turned out.\" \"Yes, that was a triumph, Bob. Well, we will do our best.\" \"Why, Bob, where have you been all the morning?\" his sister said. \"The professor came at ten o\u0027clock. He said he had arranged with you that he should be an hour later than usual, as he had another engagement, early.\" \"I forgot all about him, Carrie. He never came into my mind once, since breakfast. I met Captain Lockett down in the town, as soon as I went out, and I wanted him to come here to dinner. I knew you would be glad to see him, for you said you liked him very much; but he said he should be too busy, but he is coming up to supper, at seven. Then I went on board the Antelope and had a chat with his cousin Joe, who is first mate now.\" When dinner was finished, Bob said: \"Don\u0027t you think, Carrie, I am looking pale? What with the heat, and what with my sticking in and working so many hours a day, I begin to feel that it is too much for me.\" His sister looked anxiously at him. \"Well, Bob, you are looking a little pale, but so is everybody else; and no wonder, with this heat. But I have not been noticing you, particularly. What do you feel, Bob?\" \"I think Bob feels as if he wants a holiday,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran put in. \"Well, then, we must tell the professor that we don\u0027t want him to come, for a bit. Of course, Teddy Burke has given up coming, already. \"But if you have a holiday, Bob, what will you do with yourself?\" \"I don\u0027t think I shall get any better here, Carrie. I think I want change of air.\" \"Nonsense, Bob! You can\u0027t be as bad as all that; and you never said anything about it, before. \"If he is not well, you must ask Teddy Burke to come up to see him, Gerald. Besides, how can he have change of air? The only place he could go to would be Tetuan, and it would be hotter there than it is here.\" \"I think, Carrie,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said, \"I can prescribe for him without calling Teddy Burke in. I fancy the very thing that would get Bob set up would be a sea voyage.\" \"A sea voyage!\" his wife repeated. \"Do you mean that he should go back to England? I don\u0027t see anything serious the matter with him. Surely there cannot be anything serious enough for that.\" \"No, not so serious as that, Carrie. Just a cruise for a bit--on board the Antelope, for example.\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran looked from one to the other; and then, catching a twinkle in Bob\u0027s eye, the truth flashed across her. \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Gerald,\" she said, laughing in spite of herself. \"You have quite frightened me. I see now. Captain Locket has invited Bob to go for a cruise with him, and all this about his being ill is nonsense, from beginning to end. You don\u0027t mean to say that you have been encouraging Bob in this ridiculous idea!\" \"I don\u0027t know about encouraging, Carrie; but when he put it to me that he had been working very steadily, for the last six months; and that he had got into no scrapes; and that he had really earned a holiday, and that this would be a very jolly one; I did not see any particular reason why he shouldn\u0027t have it.\" \"No particular reason! Why, the Antelope is a privateer; and if she is going to cruise about, that means that she is going to fight, and he may get shot.\" \"So he may here, Carrie, if a ball happens to come the right way. \"I think Bob certainly deserves a reward for the way he has stuck to his lessons. You know you never expected he would do as he has done; and I am sure his uncle would be delighted, if he heard how well he speaks Spanish. \"As to his health, the boy is well enough; but there is no denying that this hot weather we are having takes it out of us all, and that it would be a mighty good thing if every soul on the Rock had the chance of a month\u0027s cruise at sea, to set him up. \"But seriously, Carrie, I don\u0027t see any reason, whatever, why he should not go. We didn\u0027t bring the boy out here to make a mollycoddle of him. He has got to settle down, some day, in a musty old office; and it seems to me that he ought to have his share in any fun and diversion that he has a chance of getting at, now. As to danger, sure you are a soldier\u0027s wife; and why shouldn\u0027t he have a share of it, just the same as if he had gone into the navy? You wouldn\u0027t have made any hullabaloo about it, if he had done that. \"This is Bob\u0027s good time, let him enjoy it. You are not going to keep a lad of his age tied to your apron strings. He has just got the chance of having two or three years of fighting, and adventure. It will be something for him to talk about, all his life; and my opinion is, that you had best let him go his own way. There are hundreds and hundreds of lads his age knocking about the world, and running all sorts of risks, without having elder sisters worrying over them.\" \"Very well, Gerald, if you and Bob have made up your minds about it, it is no use my saying no. I am sure I don\u0027t want to make a mollycoddle, as you call it, of him. Of course, uncle will blame me, if any harm comes of it.\" \"No, he won\u0027t, Carrie. Your uncle wants the boy to be a gentleman, and a man of the world. If you had said that a year ago, I would have agreed with you; but we know him better, now, and I will be bound he will like him to see as much life as he can, during this time. He has sent him out into the world. \"I will write to your uncle, myself, and tell him it is my doing entirely; and that I think it is a good thing Bob should take every chance he gets, and that I will answer for it that he won\u0027t be any the less ready, when the time comes, for buckling to at business.\" \"Well, if you really think that, Gerald, I have nothing more to say. You know I should like Bob to enjoy himself, as much as he can; only I seem to have the responsibility of him.\" \"I don\u0027t see why you worry about that, Carrie. If he had gone out to Cadiz or Oporto, as your uncle intended, you don\u0027t suppose the people there would have troubled themselves about him. He would just have gone his own way. You went your own way, didn\u0027t you? And it is mighty little you troubled yourself about what your uncle was likely to say, when you took up with an Irishman in a marching regiment; and I don\u0027t see why you should trouble now. \"The old gentleman means well with the boy but, after all, he is not either his father or his mother. You are his nearest relation and, though you are a married woman, you are not old enough, yet, to expect that a boy of Bob\u0027s age is going to treat you as if you were his mother, instead of his sister. There is not one boy in fifty would have minded us as he has done.\" \"Well, Bob, there is nothing more for me to say, after that,\" Carrie said, half laughing--though there were tears in her eyes. \"No, no, Carrie; I won\u0027t go, if you don\u0027t like,\" Bob said, impetuously. \"Yes, you shall go, Bob. Gerald is quite right. It is better you should begin to think for yourself; and I am sure I should like you to see things, and to enjoy yourself as much as you can. I don\u0027t know why I should fidget about you, for you showed you had much more good sense than I credited you with, when you gave up your chance of going to sea and went into uncle\u0027s office. \"I am sure I am the last person who ought to lecture you, after choosing to run about all over the world, and to take the risk of being starved here,\" and she smiled at her husband. \"You do as you like, Bob,\" she went on. \"I won\u0027t worry about you, in future--only if you have to go back to England without a leg, or an arm, don\u0027t blame me; and be sure you tell uncle that I made as good a fight against it as I could.\" And so it was settled. \"By the way,\" Bob exclaimed, presently, \"I have got a letter from uncle to you, in my pocket; and one for myself, also. Captain Lockett gave them to me this morning, but I forgot all about them.\" \"Well, you are a boy!\" his sister exclaimed. \"This is a nice sample, Gerald, of Bob\u0027s thoughtfulness. \"Well, give me the letter. Perhaps he writes saying you had better be sent home, by the first chance that offers itself.\" Bob\u0027s face fell. He had, indeed, himself had some misgiving, ever since the troubles began, that his uncle might be writing to that effect. \"Well, look here, Carrie,\" he said, \"here is the letter; but I think you had better not open it, till I have started on this cruise. Of course, if he says I must go back, I must; but I may as well have this trip, first.\" Carrie laughed. \"What do you think, Gerald, shall I leave it till Bob has gone?\" \"No, open it at once, Carrie. If he does say, \u0027send Bob on by the first vessel,\u0027 there is not likely to be one before he goes in the Antelope. Besides, that is all the more reason why he should go for a cruise, before he starts back for that grimy old place in Philpot Lane. We may as well see what the old gentleman says.\" \"I won\u0027t open mine till you have read yours, Carrie,\" Bob said. \"I mean to go the cruise, anyhow; but if he says I must go after that, I will go. If he had been the old bear I used to think him, I would not mind it a snap; but he has been so kind that I shall certainly do what he wants.\" Bob sat, with his hands deep in his pockets, watching his sister\u0027s face with the deepest anxiety as she glanced through the letter; Gerald standing by, and looking over her shoulder. Illustration: \u0027The old gentleman is a brick,\u0027 exclaimed Gerald. \"The old gentleman is a brick!\" Gerald, who was the first to arrive at the end, exclaimed. \"I wish I had had such a sensible old relative, myself, but--barring an aunt who kept three parrots and a cat, and who put more store on the smallest of them than she did on me--never a relative did I have, in the world.\" \"Oh, tell me that afterwards!\" Bob broke in. \"Do tell me what uncle says, Carrie.\" His sister turned to the beginning again and read aloud: \"My dear niece--\" \"Where does he write from?\" Bob interrupted. \"Is it from Philpot Lane, or from somewhere else?\" \"He writes from Matlock, Derbyshire.\" \"That is all right,\" Bob said. \"I thought, by what Gerald said, he could not have written from Philpot Lane.\" \"My dear niece,\" Carrie began again, \"I duly received your letter, saying that Bob had arrived out safely; and also his more lengthy epistle, giving an account of the incidents of the voyage. I should be glad if you would impress upon him the necessity of being more particular in his punctuation, as also in the crossing of his t\u0027s and the dotting of his i\u0027s. I have also received your letter bearing date June 1st; and note, with great satisfaction, your statement that he has been most assiduous in his studies, and that he is already able to converse with some fluency in Spanish. \"Since that time the state of affairs between the two countries has much occupied my attention--both from its commercial aspect, which is serious, and in connection with Bob. As the issue of a declaration of war is hourly expected, as I write, the period of uncertainty may be considered as over, and the two countries may be looked upon as at war. I have reason to congratulate myself upon having followed the advice of my correspondent, and of having laid in a very large supply of Spanish wine; from which I shall, under the circumstances, reap considerable profits. I have naturally been debating, with myself, whether to send for Bob to return to England; or to proceed to Lisbon, and thence to Oporto, to the care of my correspondent there. I have consulted in this matter my junior partner, Mr. Medlin, who is staying with me here for a few days; and I am glad to say that his opinion coincides with that at which I had finally arrived--namely, to allow him to remain with you. \"His conduct when with me, and the perseverance with which--as you report--he is pursuing his studies, has shown me that he will not be found wanting in business qualities, when he enters the firm. I am, therefore, all the more willing that he should use the intervening time in qualifying himself, generally, for a good position in the city of London; especially for that of the head of a firm in the wine trade, in which an acquaintance with the world, and the manners of a gentleman, if not of a man of fashion--a matter in which my firm has been very deficient, heretofore--are specially valuable. It is probable, from what I hear, that Gibraltar will be besieged; and the event is likely to be a memorable one. It will be of advantage to him, and give him a certain standing, to have been present on such an occasion. \"And if he evinces any desire to place any services he is able to render, either as a volunteer or otherwise, at the disposal of the military authorities--and I learn, from Mr. Medlin, that it is by no means unusual for the civil inhabitants of a besieged town to be called upon, to aid in its defence--I should recommend that you should place no obstacle in his way. As a lad of spirit, he would naturally be glad of any opportunity to distinguish himself. I gathered, from him, that one of his schoolfellows was serving as a midshipman in a ship of war that would, not improbably, be stationed at Gibraltar; and Bob would naturally dislike remaining inactive, when his schoolfellow, and many other lads of the same age, were playing men\u0027s parts in an historical event of such importance. Therefore you will fully understand that you have my sanction, beforehand, to agree with any desire he should express in this direction, if it seems reasonable and proper to you and Captain O\u0027Halloran. \"As it is probable that the prices of food, and other articles, will be extremely high during the siege, I have written, by this mail, to Messieurs James and William Johnston, merchants of Gibraltar--with whom I have had several transactions--authorizing them to honour drafts duly drawn by Captain O\u0027Halloran, upon me, to the extent of 500 pounds; such sum being, of course, additional to the allowance agreed upon between us for the maintenance and education of your brother. \"I remain, my dear niece, your affectionate uncle, John Bale.\" \"Now I call that being a jewel of an uncle,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said, while Bob was loud in his exclamations of pleasure. \"Now you see what you brought on yourself, Bob, by your forgetfulness. Here we have had all the trouble in life to get Carrie to agree to your going while, had she read this letter first, she would not have had a leg to stand upon--at least, metaphorically speaking; practically, no one would doubt it, for a minute.\" \"Practically, you are a goose, Gerald; metaphorically, uncle is an angel. But I am very, very glad. That has relieved me from the responsibility, altogether; and you know, at heart, I am just as willing that Bob should enjoy himself as you are. \"Now, what does your uncle say to you, Bob?\" Bob opened and read his uncle\u0027s letter, and then handed it to his sister. \"It is just the same sort of thing, Carrie. I can see Mr. Medlin\u0027s hand in it, everywhere. He says that, for the time, I must regard my connection with the firm as of secondary importance; and take any opportunity that offers to show the spirit of an English gentleman, by doing all in my power to uphold the dignity of the British flag; and taking any becoming part that may offer, in the defence of the town. Of course he says he has heard, with pleasure, of my progress in Spanish; and that he and his junior partner look forward, with satisfaction, to the time when I shall enter the firm.\u0027 \"My dear Carrie,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said, \"I will get a bottle of champagne from the mess; and this evening, at supper, we will drink your excellent uncle\u0027s health, with all the honours. I will ask Teddy Burke to come up and join us.\" \"Then I think, Gerald,\" his wife said, smiling, \"that as Captain Lockett will be here, too, one bottle of champagne will not go very far.\" \"I put it tentatively, my dear; We will say two bottles, and we will make the first inroad on our poultry yard. We had twenty eggs, this morning; and the woman downstairs reports that two of the hens want to sit, though how they explained the matter to her is more than I know; anyhow, we can afford a couple of chickens.\" It was a very jovial supper, especially as it was known that the news of the proclamation of war had been brought in, by the ship that had arrived that morning. \"By the way, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran,\" Captain Lockett said, \"I have a consignment for you. I will land it, the first thing in the morning, for I shall sail in the evening. We are to get our letters of marque, authorizing the capture of Spanish vessels, at ten o\u0027clock in the morning.\" \"What is the consignment, captain?\" \"It is from Mr. Bale, madam. I saw him in town, a week before I sailed, and told him I was likely to come on here, direct; and he sent off at once three cases of champagne, and six dozen of port, directed to you; and an eighteen gallon cask of Irish whisky, for Captain O\u0027Halloran.\" \"My dear,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said solemnly, \"I believe that you expressed, today, the opinion that your uncle was, metaphorically, an angel. I beg that the word metaphorically be omitted. If there was ever an angel in a pigtail, and a stiff cravat, that angel is Mr. John Bale, of Philpot Lane.\" \"It is very good of him,\" Carrie agreed. \"We could have done very well without the whisky, but the port wine and the champagne may be very useful, if this siege is going to be the terrible thing you all seem to fancy.\" \"A drop of the craytur is not to be despised, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran,\" Dr. Burke said; \"taken with plenty of water it is a fine digestive and, when we run short of wine and beer, you will not be despising it, yourself.\" \"I did not know, Teddy Burke, that you had any experience, whatever, of whisky mixed with plenty of water.\" \"You are too hard on me, altogether,\" the doctor laughed. \"There is no soberer man in the regiment than your humble servant.\" \"Well, it will do you all good, if you get on short allowance of wine, for a time. I can\u0027t think why men want to sit, after dinner, and drink bottle after bottle of port wine. It is all very well to say that everyone does it, but that is a very poor excuse. Why should they do it? Women don\u0027t do it, and I don\u0027t see why men should. I hope the time will come when it is considered just as disgraceful, for a man to drink, as it is for a woman. \"And now, Captain Lockett, about Bob. What time must he be on board?\" \"He must be on board before gunfire, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran, unless you get a special order from the town major. I was obliged to get one, myself, for this evening. The orders are strict, now; all the gates are closed at gunfire.\" \"Yes, and mighty strict they are,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said. \"There was Major Corcoran, of the 72nd, and the doctor of the regiment were out fishing yesterday; and the wind fell, and the gun went just as they were landing, and divil a bit could they get in. The major is a peppery little man, and I would have given anything to have seen him. One of the Hanoverian regiments furnished the guard, at the water batteries; and the sentry told him, if he came a foot nearer in the boat they would fire and, in the end, he and the doctor had to cover themselves up with a sail, and lie there all night. I hear the major went to lodge a complaint, when he landed; but of course the men were only doing their duty, and I hear Eliott gave him a wigging, for endeavouring to make them disobey orders.\" \"I will be on board before gunfire, Captain Lockett. There is no fear of my missing it.\" \"How long do you expect to be away, Captain Lockett?\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran asked. \"That depends on how we get on. If we are lucky, and pick up a number of prizes, we may bring them in in a week; if not we may be three weeks, especially if this calm weather lasts.\" \"I am sure I hope you won\u0027t be too lucky, at first, captain,\" Bob put in. \"I don\u0027t want the cruise to finish in a week.\" \"Oh, I sha\u0027n\u0027t consider the cruise is finished, merely because we come in, Bob!\" the captain said. \"We shall be going out again, and only put in here to bring in our prizes. The cruise will last as long as Captain O\u0027Halloran and your sister will allow you to remain on board. \"I expect that I shall be able to make you very useful. I shall put you down in the ship\u0027s books as third mate. You won\u0027t be able to draw prize money, as an officer, because the number of officers entitled to prize money was entered when the crew signed articles; but if I put you down as supercargo you will share, with the men, in any prizes we take while you are away with us.\" \"That will be jolly, captain; not because of the money, you know, but because it will give one more interest in the cruise. Besides, I shall like something to do.\" \"Oh, I will give you something to do! I shall put you in Joe\u0027s watch, and then you will learn something. It is always as well to pick up knowledge, when you get a chance; and if we do take any prizes it will be your duty, as supercargo, to take an inventory of what they have on board.\" The next morning Bob packed his trunks, the first thing; then he went round to the professor\u0027s, and told him that he was going away, for a fortnight or so, for a cruise; then he went down to the port, and met Joe Lockett when he landed, and brought him up to breakfast, as had been arranged with the captain the night before. After that, he went with him up the Rock to look at the Spaniards--whose tents were a good deal more numerous than they had been, and who were still at work, arming the forts. \"If I were the general,\" Joe said, \"I would go out at night, with two or three regiments, and spike all those guns, and blow up the forts. The Dons wouldn\u0027t be expecting it; and it would be a good beginning, and would put the men in high spirits. \"Do you see, the Spanish fleet has drifted away almost out of sight, to the east. I thought what it would be, at sunset yesterday, when I saw that they did not enter the bay; for the current would be sure to drive them away, if the wind didn\u0027t spring up. \"Well, I hope we shall get a little, this evening. And now I must be going down, for there is a good deal to do, before we sail.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3143/86378.html","bookId":813,"book":{"id":813,"title":"Held Fast For England","description":"简介： The Siege of Gibraltar stands almost alone in the annals of warfare, alike in its duration and in the immense preparations made, by the united powers of France and Spain, for the capture of the fortress.
