{"id":8877,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 6: The Rock Fortress.","content":"On the third day after her arrival at Lisbon, the Antelope\u0027s anchor was hove up, and she dropped down the river. Half an hour later, a barque and another brig came out and joined her; the three captains having agreed, the day before, that they would sail in company, as they were all bound through the Straits. Captain Lockett had purchased two 14-pounder guns, at Lisbon; and the brig, therefore, now carried three guns on each side, besides her long 18 pounder. The barque carried fourteen guns, and the other brig ten; so that they felt confident of being able to beat off any French privateer they might meet, on the way. One or two suspicious sails were sighted, as they ran down the coast; but none of these approached within gunshot, the three craft being, evidently, too strong to be meddled with. Rounding Cape St. Vincent at a short distance, they steered for the mouth of the Straits. After the bold cliffs of Portugal, Bob was disappointed with the aspect of the Spanish coast. \"Ah! It is all very well,\" the first mate replied, when he expressed his opinion. \"Give me your low, sandy shores, and let those who like have what you call the fine, bold rocks. \"Mind, I don\u0027t mean coasts with sandbanks lying off them; but a coast with a shelving beach, and pretty deep water, right up to it. If you get cast on a coast like that of Portugal, it is certain death. Your ship will get smashed up like an eggshell, against those rocks you are talking of, and not a soul gets a chance of escape; while if you are blown on a flat coast, you may get carried within a ship\u0027s length of the beach before you strike, and it is hard if you can\u0027t get a line on shore; besides, it is ten to one the ship won\u0027t break up, for hours. \"No, you may get a landsman to admire your bold cliffs, but you won\u0027t get a sailor to agree with him.\" \"We seem to be going along fast, although there is not much wind.\" \"Yes, there is a strong current. You see, the rivers that fall into the Mediterranean ain\u0027t sufficient to make up for the loss by evaporation, and so there is always a current running in here. It is well enough for us, going east; but it is not so pleasant, when you want to come out. Then you have got to wait till you can get a breeze, from somewhere about east, to carry you out. I have been kept waiting, sometimes, for weeks; and it is no unusual thing to see two or three hundred ships anchored, waiting for the wind to change.\" \"Are there any pirates over on that side?\" Bob asked, looking across at the African coast. \"Not about here. Ceuta lies over there. They are good friends with us, and Gibraltar gets most of its supplies from there. But once through the Straits we give that coast a wide berth; for the Algerine pirates are nearly as bad as ever, and would snap up any ship becalmed on their coast, or that had the bad luck to be blown ashore. I hope, some day, we shall send a fleet down, and blow the place about their ears. It makes one\u0027s blood boil, to think that there are hundreds and hundreds of Englishmen working, as slaves, among the Moors. \"There, do you see that projecting point with a fort on it, and a town lying behind? That is Tarifa. That used to be a great place, in the time when the Moors were masters in Spain.\" \"Yes,\" the captain, who had just joined them, said. \"Tarif was a great Moorish commander, I have heard, and the place is named after him. Gibraltar is also named after a Moorish chief, called Tarik ibn Zeyad.\" Bob looked surprised. \"I don\u0027t see that it is much like his name, captain.\" \"No, Master Repton, it doesn\u0027t sound much like it, now. The old name of the place was Gebel Tarik, which means Tank\u0027s Hill; and it is easy to see how Gebel Tarik got gradually changed into Gibraltar.\" In another two hours the Straits were passed, and the Rock of Gibraltar appeared, rising across a bay to the left. Illustration: View of Gibraltar from the Mediterranean. View of Gibraltar from the Mediterranean. \"There is your destination, lad,\" the captain said. \"It is a strong-looking place, isn\u0027t it?\" \"It is, indeed, Captain,\" Bob said, taking the captain\u0027s glass from the top of the skylight, and examining the Rock. \"You see,\" the captain went on, \"the Rock is divided from the mainland by that low spit of sand. It is only a few hundred yards wide, and the sea goes round at the back of the Rock, and along the other side of that spit--though you can\u0027t see it from here--so anything coming to attack it must advance along the spit, under the fire of the guns. \"There, do you see that building, standing up on the hill above the town? That is the old Moorish castle, and there are plenty of modern batteries scattered about near it, though you can\u0027t see them. You see, the Rock rises sheer up from the spit; and it is only on this side, close to the water\u0027s edge, that the place can be entered. \"The weak side of the place is along this sea face. On the other side, the Rock rises right out of the water; but on this side, as you see, it slopes gradually down. There are batteries, all along by the water\u0027s edge; but if the place were attacked by a fleet strong enough to knock those batteries to pieces, and silence their guns, a landing could be effected. \"At the southern end you see the rocks are bolder, and there is no landing there. That is called Europa Point, and there is a battery there, though you can\u0027t make it out, from here.\" The scene was a very pretty one, and Bob watched it with the greatest interest. A frigate, and two men-of-war brigs, were anchored at some little distance from the Rock; and around them were some thirty or forty merchantmen, waiting for a change in the wind to enable them to sail out through the Straits. White-sailed boats were gliding about among them. At the head of the bay were villages nestled among trees, while the country behind was broken and hilly. On the opposite side of the bay was a town of considerable size, which the captain told him was Algeciras. It was, he said, a large town at the time of the Moors, very much larger and more important than Gibraltar. The ground rose gradually behind it, and was completely covered with foliage, orchards, and orange groves. The captain said: \"You see that rock rising at the end of the bay from among the trees, lads. That is called \u0027the Queen of Spain\u0027s Chair.\u0027 It is said that, at a certain siege when the Moors were here, the then Queen of Spain took her seat on that rock, and declared she would never go away till Gibraltar was taken. She also took an oath never to change her linen, until it surrendered. I don\u0027t know how she managed about it, at last, for the place never did surrender. I suppose she got a dispensation, and was able to get into clean clothes again, some day. \"I have heard tell that the Spaniards have a colour that is called by her name--a sort of dirty yellow. It came out at that time. Of course, it would not have been etiquette for other ladies to wear white, when her majesty was obliged to wear dingy garments; so they all took to having their things dyed, so as to match hers; and the tint has borne her name, ever since.\" \"It is a very nasty idea,\" Bob said; \"and I should think she took pretty good care, afterwards, not to take any oaths. It is hot enough, now; and I should think, in summer, it must be baking here.\" \"It is pretty hot, on the Rock, in summer. You know, they call the natives of the place Rock scorpions. Scorpions are supposed to like heat, though I don\u0027t know whether they do. You generally find them lying under pieces of loose rock; but whether they do it for heat, or to keep themselves cool, I can\u0027t say. \"Now, Mr. Probert, you may as well take some of the sail off her. We will anchor inside those craft, close to the New Mole. They may want to get her alongside, to unload the government stores we have brought out; and the nearer we are in, the less trouble it will be to warp her alongside, tomorrow morning. Of course, if the landing place is full, they will send lighters out to us.\" Illustration: View of Gibraltar from the Bay. View of Gibraltar from the Bay. The sails were gradually got off the brig, and she had but little way on when her anchor was dropped, a cable\u0027s length from the end of the Mole. Scarcely had she brought up when a boat shot out from the end of the pier. \"Hooray!\" Bob shouted. \"There are my sister, and Gerald.\" \"I thought as much,\" the captain said. \"We hoisted our number, as soon as we came round the point; and the signal station, on the top of the Rock, would send down the news directly they made out our colours.\" \"Well, Bob, it gave me quite a turn,\" his sister said, after the first greetings were over, \"when we saw how the sails were all patched, and everyone said that the ship must have been in action. I was very anxious, till I saw your head above the bulwarks.\" \"Yes, we have been in a storm, and a fight, and we came pretty near being taken. Did you get out all right?\" \"Yes, we had a very quiet voyage.\" The captain then came up, and was introduced. \"I have a box or two for you, madam, in addition to your brother\u0027s kit. Mr. Bale sent them down, a couple of days before we sailed. \"At one time, it didn\u0027t seem likely that you would ever see their contents, for we had a very close shave of it. In the first place, we had about as bad a gale as I have met with, in crossing the bay; and were blown into the bight, with the loss of our bowsprit, fore-topmast and four of our guns, that we had to throw overboard to lighten her. \"Then a French lugger, that would have been a good deal more than a match for her, at any time, came up. We might have out sailed her, if we could have carried all our canvas; but with only a jury topmast, she was too fast for us. As you may see by our sails, we had a smart fight but, by the greatest good fortune, we knocked the mainmast out of her. \"Then we were chased by a French frigate, with the lugger to help her. However, we gave them the slip in the night, and here we are. \"I am afraid you won\u0027t get your brother\u0027s boxes, till tomorrow. Nothing can go ashore till the port officer has been on board, and the usual formalities gone through. I don\u0027t know, yet, whether we shall discharge into lighters, or go alongside; but I will have your boxes all put together, in readiness for you, the first thing in the morning, whichever way it is.\" \"We shall be very glad if you will dine with us, tomorrow,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said. \"We dine at one o\u0027clock or, if that would be inconvenient for you, come to supper at seven.\" \"I would rather do that, if you will let me,\" Captain Lockett replied. \"I shall be pretty busy tomorrow, and you military gentlemen do give us such a lot of trouble--in the way of papers, documents, and signatures--that I never like leaving the ship, till I get rid of the last bale and box with the government brand on it.\" \"Very well, then; we shall expect you to supper.\" \"I shall come down first thing in the morning, captain,\" Bob said, \"so I need not say goodbye to anyone, now.\" \"You had better bring only what you may want with you for the night, Bob,\" his sister put in, as he was about to run below. \"The cart will take everything else up, together, in the morning.\" \"Then I shall be ready in a minute,\" Bob said, running below; and it was not much more before he reappeared, with a small handbag. \"I shall see you again tomorrow, Mr. Probert. I shall be here about our luggage;\" and he took his place in the boat beside the others, who had already descended the ladder. \"And you have had a pleasant voyage, Bob?\" Captain O\u0027Halloran asked. \"Very jolly, Gerald; first rate. Captain Lockett was as kind as could be; and the first mate was very good, too, though I did not think he would be, when I first saw him; and Joe Lockett, the second mate, is a capital fellow.\" \"But how was it that you did not take that French privateer, Bob? With a fellow like you on board--the capturer of a gang of burglars, and all that sort of thing--I should have thought that, instead of running away, you would have gone straight at her; that you would have thrown yourself on her deck at the head of the boarders, would have beaten the Frenchmen below, killed their captain in single combat, and hauled down their flag.\" \"There is no saying what I might have done,\" Bob laughed, \"if it had come to boarding; but as it was, I did not feel the least wish for a closer acquaintance with the privateer. It was too close to be pleasant, as it was--a good deal too close. It is a pity you were not there, to have set me an example.\" \"I am going to do that now, Bob, and I hope you will profit by it. \"Now then, you jump out first, and give Carrie your hand. That is it.\" And, having settled with the boatman, Captain O\u0027Halloran followed the others\u0027 steps. It was a busy scene. Three ships were discharging their cargoes, and the wharf was covered with boxes and bales, piles of shot and shell, guns, and cases of ammunition. Fatigue parties of artillery and infantry men were piling the goods, or stowing them in handcarts. Goods were being slung down from the ships, and were swinging in the air, or run down to the cry of \"Look below!\" \"Mind how you go, Carrie,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said, \"or you will be getting what brains you have knocked out.\" \"If that is all the danger, Gerald,\" she laughed, \"you are safe, anyhow. \"Now, Bob, do look out!\" she broke off as, while glancing round, he tripped over a hawser and fell. \"Are you hurt?\" \"Never mind him, Carrie--look out for yourself. A boy never gets hurt. \"Now, keep your eyes about you, Bob. You can come and look at all this, any day.\" At last they got to the end of the Mole. Then they passed under an archway, with a massive gate, at which stood a sentry; then they found themselves in a sort of yard, surrounded by a high wall, on the top of which two cannon were pointed down upon them. Crossing the yard, they passed through another gateway. The ground here rose sharply, and a hundred yards further back stood another battery; completely commanding the Mole, and the defences through which they had passed. The ground here was comparatively level, rising gradually to the foot of the rock, which then rose steeply up. A few houses were scattered about, surrounded by gardens. Hedges of cactus lined the road. Parties of soldiers and sailors, natives with carts, and women in picturesque costumes passed along. The vegetation on the low ground was abundant, and Bob looked with delight at the semi-tropical foliage. Turning to the right they followed the road, passed under an archway in a strong wall, and were in the town, itself. \"We are not living in barracks,\" Carrie said. \"Fortunately there was no room there, and we draw lodging allowance, and have taken the upper portion of a Spanish house. It is much more pleasant. Besides, if we had had to live in quarters, we should have had no room for you.\" \"The streets are steep,\" Bob said. \"I can\u0027t make out how these little donkeys keep their feet on the slippery stones, with those heavy loads. \"Oh! I say, there are two rum-looking chaps. What are they--Moors?\" \"Yes. You will see lots of them here, Bob. They come across from Ceuta, and there are some of them established here, as traders. What with the Moors, and Spaniards, and Jews, and the sailors from the shipping, you can hear pretty nearly every European language spoken, in one walk through the streets.\" \"Oh, I say, isn\u0027t this hot?\" Bob exclaimed, mopping his face; \"and isn\u0027t there a glare from all these white walls, and houses! How much higher is it?\" \"About another hundred yards, Bob. There, you see, we are getting beyond the streets now.\" They had now reached a flat shoulder; and on this the houses were somewhat scattered, standing in little inclosures, with hedges of cactus and geranium, and embowered in shrubs and flowers. \"This is our house,\" Carrie said, stopping before a rickety wooden gateway, hung upon two massive posts of masonry. \"You see, we have got a flight of steps outside, and we are quite cut off from the people below.\" They ascended the stairs. At the top there was a sort of wide porch, with a wooden roof; which was completely covered with creepers, growing from two wooden tubs. Four or five plants, covered with blossoms, stood on the low walls; and two or three chairs showed that the little terrace was used as an open-air sitting room. \"In another hour, when the sun gets lower, Bob, we can come and sit here. It is a lovely view, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Beautiful!\" Bob said, leaning on the wall. Below them lay the sea front, with its gardens and bright foliage and pretty houses, with Europa Point and the sea stretching away beyond it. A little to the right were the African hills; and then, turning slightly round, the Spanish coast, with Algeciras nestled in foliage, and the bay with all its shipping. The head of the bay was hidden, for the ground behind was higher than that on which the house stood. \"Come in, Bob,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said. \"You had better get out of the sun. Of course, it is nothing to what it will be; but it is hot now, and we are none of us acclimatized, yet.\" The rooms were of a fair size, but the light-coloured walls gave them a bare appearance, to Bob\u0027s eyes. They were, however, comfortably furnished, matting being laid down instead of carpets. \"It is cooler, and cheaper,\" Carrie said, seeing Bob looking at them. \"This is your room, and this is the kitchen,\" and she opened the door into what seemed to Bob a tiny place, indeed. Across one end was a mass of brickwork, rather higher than an ordinary table. Several holes, a few inches deep, were scattered about over this. In some of these small charcoal fires were burning, and pots were placed over them. There were small openings from the front, leading to these tiny fireplaces; and a Spanish girl was driving the air into one of these, with a fan, when they entered. \"This is my brother, Manola,\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran said. The girl smiled and nodded, and then continued her work. \"She speaks English?\" Bob said, as they went out. \"She belongs to the Rock, Bob. Almost all the natives here talk a little English.\" \"Where do these steps lead to? I thought we were at the top of the house.\" \"Come up and see,\" Carrie said, leading the way. Following her, Bob found himself on a flat terrace, extending over the whole of the house. Several orange trees--in tubs--and many flowers, and small shrubs in pots stood upon it; and three or four light cane-work lounging chairs stood apart. \"Here is where we come when the sun is down, Bob. There is no finer view, we flatter ourselves, anywhere in Gib. Here we receive our guests, in the evening. We have only begun yet, but we mean to make a perfect garden of it.\" \"It is splendid!\" Bob said, as he walked round by the low parapet, and gazed at the view in all directions; \"and we can see what everyone else is doing on their roofs, and no one can look down on us--except from the rock over there, behind us, and there are no houses there.\" \"No, the batteries commanding the neutral ground lie over that crest, Bob. We are quite shut in, on two sides; but we make up for it by the extent of our view, on the others. We are very lucky in getting the place. A regiment went home in the transport that brought us out. Gerald knew some of the officers, and one of them had been staying here, and told Gerald of it; and we took it at once. The other officers\u0027 wives are all quite jealous of me and, though some of them have very nice quarters, it is admitted that, as far as the view goes, this is by far the best. Besides, it is a great thing being out of the town, and it does not take Gerald more than three or four minutes longer to get down to the barracks. \"But now, let us go downstairs. I am sure you must want something to eat, and we sha\u0027n\u0027t have supper for another three hours.\" \"I dined at twelve,\" Bob said, \"just before we rounded the point, and I could certainly hold on until supper time Still, I daresay I could eat something, now.\" \"Oh, it is only a snack! It is some stewed chicken and some fruit. That won\u0027t spoil your supper, Bob?\" \"You will be glad to hear, Bob,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said, as the lad was eating his meal, \"that I have secured the services of a Spanish professor for you. He is to begin next Monday.\" Bob\u0027s face fell. \"I don\u0027t see that there was need for such a hurry,\" he said, ruefully, laying down his knife and fork. \"I don\u0027t see there was need for any hurry, at all. Besides, of course, I want to see the place.\" \"You will be able to see a good deal of it, in four days, Bob; and your time won\u0027t be entirely occupied, when you do begin. The days are pretty long here, everyone gets up early. \"He is to come at seven o\u0027clock in the morning. You have a cup of coffee, and some bread and butter and fruit, before that. He will go at nine, then we have breakfast. Then you will have your time to yourself, till dinner at half past two. The assistant surgeon of our regiment--he is a Dublin man--will come to you for Latin, and what I may call general knowledge, for two hours. That is all; except, I suppose, that you will work a bit by yourself, of an evening. \"That is not so bad, is it?\" \"What sort of man is the assistant surgeon?\" Bob replied, cautiously. \"It all depends how much he is going to give me to do, in the evening.\" \"I don\u0027t think he will give you anything to do, in the evening, Bob. Of course, the Spanish is the principal thing, and I told him that you will have to work at that.\" \"I don\u0027t think you need be afraid, Bob,\" his sister laughed. \"You won\u0027t find Dr. Burke a very severe kind of instructor. Nobody but Gerald would ever have thought of choosing him.\" \"Sure, and didn\u0027t you agree with me, Carrie,\" her husband said, in an aggrieved voice, \"that as we were not going to make the boy a parson, and as it was too much to expect him to learn Spanish, and a score of other things, at once; that we ought to get someone who would make his lessons pleasant for him, and not be worrying his soul out of his body with all sorts of useless balderdash?\" \"Yes, we agreed that, Gerald; but there was a limit, and when you told me you had spoken to Teddy Burke about it, and arranged the matter with him, I thought you had gone beyond that limit, altogether.\" \"He is just the man for Bob, Carrie. That boy will find it mighty dull here, after a bit, and will want someone to cheer him up. I promised the old gentleman I would find him someone who could push Bob on in his humanities; and Teddy Burke has taken his degree at Dublin, and I will venture to say will get him on faster than a stiff starched man will do. Bob would always be playing tricks, with a fellow like that, and be getting into rows with him. There will be no playing tricks with Teddy Burke, for he is up to the whole thing, himself.\" \"I should think he is, Gerald. Well, we will see how it works, anyhow. \"Go on with your fowl, Bob. You will see all about it, in good time.\" Bob felt satisfied that the teacher his brother-in-law had chosen for him was not a very formidable personage; and his curiosity as to what he would be like was satisfied, that evening. After he had finished his meal, he went for a stroll with Captain O\u0027Halloran through the town, and round the batteries at that end of the Rock, returning to supper. After the meal was over, they went up to the terrace above. There was not a breath of wind, and a lamp on a table there burned without a flicker. They had scarcely taken their seats when Manola announced Dr. Burke, and a minute later an officer in uniform made his appearance on the terrace. He wore a pair of blue spectacles, and advanced in a stiff and formal manner. \"I wish you a good evening, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran. So this is our young friend! \"You are well, I hope, Master Repton; and are none the worse for the inconveniences I hear you have suffered on your voyage?\" Carrie, to Bob\u0027s surprise, burst into a fit of laughter. \"What is the matter, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran?\" Dr. Burke asked, looking at her with an air of mild amazement. \"I am laughing at you, Teddy Burke. How can you be so ridiculous?\" The doctor removed his spectacles. \"Now, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran,\" he said, with a strong brogue. \"Do you call that acting fairly by me? Didn\u0027t you talk to me yourself, half an hour yesterday, and impress upon me that I ought to be grave and steady, now that I was going to enter upon the duties of a pedagogue; and ain\u0027t I trying my best to act up to your instructions, and there you burst out laughing in my face, and spoil it all, entirely? \"Gerald said to me, \u0027Now mind, Teddy, it is a responsible affair. The boy is up to all sorts of divarsions, and divil a bit will he attend to ye, if he finds that you are as bad, if not worse, than he is himself.\u0027 \"\u0027But,\u0027 said I, \u0027it\u0027s Latin and such like that you are wanting me to teach him; and not manners at all, at all.\u0027 \"And he says, \u0027It is all one. It is quiet and well behaved that you have got to be, Teddy. The missis has been houlding out about the iniquity of taking a spalpeen, like yourself; and it is for you to show her that she is mistaken, altogether.\u0027 \"So I said, \u0027You trust me, Gerald, I will be as grave as a doctor of divinity.\u0027 \"So I got out these glasses--which I bought because they told me that they would be wanted here, to keep out the glare of the sun--and I came here, and spoke as proper as might be; and then, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran, you burst out laughing in my face, and destroy the whole effect of these spectacles, and all. \"Well, we must make the best of a bad business; and we will try, for a bit, anyhow. If he won\u0027t mind me, Gerald must go to the chaplain, as he intended to; and I pity the boy, then. I would rather be had up before the colonel, any day, than have any matter in dispute with him.\" \"You are too bad, Teddy Burke,\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran said, still laughing. \"It was all very well for you to try and look sensible, but to put on that face was too absurd. You know you could not have kept it up for five minutes. \"No, I don\u0027t think it will do,\" and she looked serious now. \"I always thought that it was out of the question, but this bad beginning settles it.\" But Bob, who had been immensely amused, now broke in. \"Why not, Carrie? I am sure I should work better, for Dr. Burke, than I should for anyone who was very strict and stiff. One is always wanting to do something, with a man like that: to play tricks with his wig or pigtail, or something of that sort. You might let us try, anyhow; and if Dr. Burke finds that I am not attentive, and don\u0027t mind him, then you can put me with somebody else.\" \"Sure, we shall get on first rate, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran. Gerald says the boy is a sensible boy, and that he has been working very well under an old uncle of yours. He knows for himself that it\u0027s no use his having a master, if he isn\u0027t going to try his best to get on. When I was at school, I used to get larrupped every day; and used to think, to myself, what a grand thing it would be to have a master just like what Dr. Burke, M.D., Dublin, is now; and I expect it is just about the same, with him. We sha\u0027n\u0027t work any the worse because, maybe, we will joke over it, sometimes.\" \"Very well, then, we will try, Teddy; though I know the whole regiment will think Gerald and I have gone mad, when they hear about it. But I shall keep my eye upon you both.\" \"The more you keep your eye upon me, the better I shall be plazed, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran; saving your husband\u0027s presence,\" the doctor said, insinuatingly. \"Do sit down and be reasonable, Teddy. There are cigars in that box on the table.\" \"The tobacco here almost reconciles one to living outside Ireland,\" Dr. Burke said, as he lit a cigar, and seated himself in one of the comfortable chairs. \"Just about a quarter the price they are at home, and brandy at one shilling per bottle. It is lucky for the country that we don\u0027t get them at that price, in Ireland; for it is mighty few boys they would get to enlist, if they could get tobacco and spirits at such prices, at home.\" \"I have been telling Gerald that it will be much better for him to drink claret, out here,\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran said. \"And you are not far wrong,\" the doctor agreed; \"but the native wines here are good enough for me, and you can get them at sixpence a quart. I was telling them, at mess yesterday, that we must not write home and tell them about it; or faith, there would be such an emigration that the Rock wouldn\u0027t hold the people--not if you were to build houses all over it. Sixpence a quart, and good sound tipple! \"Sure, and it was a mighty mistake of Providence that Ireland was not dropped down into the sea, off the coast of Spain. What a country it would have been!\" \"I don\u0027t know, Teddy,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said. \"As the people don\u0027t kill themselves with overwork, now, I doubt if they would ever work at all, if they had the excuse of a hot climate for doing nothing.\" \"There would not have been so much need, Gerald. They needn\u0027t have bothered about the thatch, when it only rains once in six months, or so; while as for clothes, it is little enough they would have needed. And the bogs would all have dried up, and they would have had crops without more trouble than just scratching the ground, and sowing in the seed; and they would have grown oranges, instead of praties. Oh, it would have been a great country, entirely!\" The doctor\u0027s three listeners all went off into a burst of laughter, at the seriousness with which he spoke. \"But you would have had trouble with your pigs,\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran said. \"The Spanish pigs are wild, fierce-looking beasts, and would never be content to share the cottages.\" \"Ah! But we would have had Irish pigs just the same as now. Well, what do you think--\" and he broke off suddenly, sitting upright, and dropping the brogue altogether--\"they were saying, at mess, that the natives declare there are lots of Spanish troops moving down in this direction; and that a number of ships are expected, with stores, at Algeciras.\" \"Well, what of that?\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran asked. \"We are at peace with Spain. What does it matter where they move their troops, or land stores?\" \"That is just the thing. We are at peace with them, sure enough; but that is no reason why we should be always at peace. You know how they hate seeing our flag flying over the Rock; and they may think that, now we have got our hands full with France, and the American colonists, it will be the right time for them to join in the scrimmage, and see if they can\u0027t get the Rock back again.\" \"But they would never go to war, without any ground of complaint!\" \"I don\u0027t know, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran. When one wants to pick a quarrel with a man, it is always a mighty easy thing to do so. You can tread on his toe, and ask him what he put it there for; or sit down on his hat, and swear that he put it on the chair on purpose; or tell him that you do not like the colour of his hair, or that his nose isn\u0027t the shape that pleases you. It is the easiest thing in the world to find something to quarrel about, when you have a mind for it.\" \"Are you quite serious, Teddy?\" \"Never more serious in my life. \"Have you heard about it, Gerald?\" \"I heard them saying something about it, when we were waiting for the colonel on parade, this morning; but I did not think much of it.\" \"Well, of course, it mayn\u0027t be true, Gerald; but the colonel and major both seemed to think that there was something in it. It seems, from what they said, that the governor has had letters that seemed to confirm the news that several regiments are on the march south; and that stores are being collected at Cadiz, and some of the other seaports. There is nothing, as far as we know, specially said about Gibraltar; but what else can they be getting ready for, unless it is to cross the Straits and attack the Moors--and they are at peace with them, at present, just as they are with us? I mean to think that they are coming here, till we are downright sure they are not. The news is so good, I mean to believe that it is true, as long as I can.\" \"For shame, Teddy!\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran said. \"You can\u0027t be so wicked as to hope that they are going to attack us?\" \"And it is exactly that point of wickedness I have arrived at,\" the doctor said, again dropping into the brogue. \"In the first place, sha\u0027n\u0027t we need something, to kape us from dying entirely of nothing to do at all, at all, in this wearisome old place? We are fresh to it, and we are not tired, yet, of the oranges and the wine and the cigars, and the quare people you see in the streets; but the regiments that have been here some time are just sick of their lives. Then, in the second place, how am I going to learn my profession, if we are going to stop here, quiet and peaceful, for years? Didn\u0027t I come into the army to study gunshot wounds and, barring duels, divil a wound have I seen since I joined. It\u0027s getting rusty I am, entirely; and there is the elegant case of instruments my aunt gave me, that have never been opened. By the same token, I will have them out and oil them, in the morning.\" \"Don\u0027t talk in that way, Teddy. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. It seems to me that you are making a great to-do about nothing. Some soldiers have been marched somewhere in Spain, and all this talk is made up about it. They must know, very well, they can\u0027t take the Rock. They tried it once, and I should have thought they would not be in a hurry to try it again. I shall believe in it when I see it. \"You need not look so delighted, Bob. If there should be any trouble--and it seems nonsense even to think about such a thing--but if there should be any, we should put you on board the very first vessel sailing for England, and get you off our minds.\" Bob laughed. \"I should go down and ship as a powder monkey, on one of the ships of war; or enlist as a drummer, in one of the regiments; and then I should be beyond your authority, altogether.\" \"I begin to think you are beyond my authority already, Bob. \"Gerald, I am afraid we did a very foolish thing in agreeing to have this boy out here.\" \"Well, we have got him on our hands now, Carrie; and it is early, yet, for you to find out your mistake. \"Well, if there should be a siege--\" \"You know there is no chance of it, Gerald.\" \"Well, I only say if, and we are cut off from all the world, he will be a companion to you, and keep you alive, while I am in the batteries.\" \"I won\u0027t hear such nonsense talked any more, Gerald; and if Teddy Burke is going to bring us every bit of absurd gossip that may be picked up from the peasants, he can stay away, altogether.\" \"Except when he comes to instruct his pupil, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran.\" \"Oh, that is not likely to last long, Dr. Burke!\" \"That is to be seen, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran. It is a nice example you are setting him of want of respect for his instructor. I warn you that, before another six months have passed, you will have to confess that it has been just the very best arrangement that could have been made; and will thank your stars that Dr. Edward Burke, M.D., of Dublin, happened to be here, ready to your hand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3143/86375.html","bookId":813,"book":{"id":813,"title":"Held Fast For England","description":"简介： The Siege of Gibraltar stands almost alone in the annals of warfare, alike in its duration and in the immense preparations made, by the united powers of France and Spain, for the capture of the fortress.
