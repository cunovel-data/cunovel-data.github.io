{"id":8885,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 14: A Welcome Cargo.","content":"After the men had been rowing for an hour, Bob felt a slight breeze springing up from off the land, and said: \"You may as well get up the sail. It will help you along a bit.\" The sail was a large one, for the size of the boat; and Bob felt a distinct increase in her pace, as soon as the men began to row again. He could make out the line of the hills against the sky; and had, therefore, no difficulty in keeping the course. They were soon back opposite Marbella, the lights of which he could clearly make out. Little by little the breeze gathered strength, and the rowers had comparatively easy work of it, as the boat slipped away lightly before the wind. \"What do you make it--twelve leagues from Marbella to the Rock?\" \"About that,\" the man replied. \"If the wind holds like this, we shall not be very far from the Rock by daylight. We are going along about a league an hour.\" \"Well, stretch out to it, lads, for your own sakes. I have no fear of a shot from Santa Barbara. The only thing I am afraid of is that we should be seen by any Spanish boats that may be cruising round that side, before we get under shelter of the guns of the Rock.\" The fishermen needed no warning as to the danger of being caught, and bent again more strongly to their oars. After they had rowed two hours longer, Bob told them to pull the oars in. \"You had better have a quarter of an hour\u0027s rest, and some supper and a bottle of wine,\" he said. \"You have got your own basket, forward. I will take mine out of this by my side.\" As their passenger had paid for it, the boatmen had got a very superior wine to that they ordinarily drank. After eating their supper--bread, meat, and onions--and drinking half a bottle of wine, each, they were disposed to look at the situation in a more cheerful light. Two hundred and fifty dollars was certainly well worth running a little risk for. Why, it would make them independent of bad weather; and they would be able to freight their boat themselves, with fish or fruit, and to trade on their own account. They were surprised at the enterprise of this young trader, whom they supposed to be a native of Gibraltar; for Bob thought that it was as well that they should remain in ignorance of his nationality, as they might have felt more strongly that they were rendering assistance to the enemy, did they know that he was English. Hour after hour passed. The wind did not increase in force nor, on the other hand, did it die away. There was just enough to keep the sail full, and take much of the weight of the boat off the arms of the rowers. The men, knowing the outline of the hills, were able to tell what progress they were making; and told Bob when they were passing Estepona. Two or three times there was a short pause, for the men to have a draught of wine. With that exception, they rowed on steadily. \"It will be a near thing, senor,\" one of them said, towards morning. \"The current counts for three or four miles against us. If it hadn\u0027t been for that, we should certainly have done it. As it is, it is doubtful.\" \"I think we are about a mile off shore, are we not?\" Bob asked. \"That is about the distance I want to keep. If there are any cruisers, they are sure to be further out than that; and as for Santa Barbara, if they see us and take the trouble to fire at us, there is not much chance of their hitting such a mark as this, a mile away. Besides, almost all their guns are on the land side.\" The men made no reply. To them, the thought of being fired at by big guns was much more alarming than that of being picked up by a cruiser of their own nation; although they saw there might be a good deal of difficulty in persuading the authorities that they had taken part, perforce, in the attempt to get fruit into the beleaguered garrison. Daylight was just beginning to break, when one of the fishermen pointed out a dark mass inshore, but somewhat ahead of them. \"That is Santa Barbara,\" he said. They had already, for some time, made out the outline of the Rock; and Bob gazed anxiously seaward but could, as yet, see no signs of the enemy\u0027s cruisers. \"Row away, lads,\" he said. \"They won\u0027t see us for some time and, in another half hour, we shall be safe.\" The Spaniards bent to their oars with all their strength, now; from time to time looking anxiously over their shoulders at the fort. Rapidly the daylight stole across the sky, and they were just opposite Santa Barbara when a gun boomed out, and a shot flew over their heads and struck the water, a quarter of a mile beyond them. With a yell of fear, the two Spaniards threw themselves at the bottom of the boat. \"Get up, you fools!\" Bob shouted. \"You will be no safer, down there, than if you were rowing. If a shot strikes her she will be smashed up, whether you are rowing or lying down. If you stay there, it will be an hour before we get out of range of their guns while, if you row like men, we shall get further and further away every minute, and be safe in a quarter of an hour.\" It was only, however, after he threatened to shoot them, if they did not set to work again, that the Spaniards resumed their oars; but when they did they rowed desperately. Another shot from the fort struck the water a short distance astern, exciting a fresh yell of agony from the men. \"There, you see,\" Bob said; \"if you hadn\u0027t been sending her faster through the water, that would have hit us. \"Ah! They are beginning from that sloop, out at sea.\" This was a small craft that Bob had made out, as the light increased, a mile and a half seaward. She had changed her course, and was heading in their direction. Retaining his hold of his pistols Bob moved forward, put out a spare oar, and set to to row. Shot after shot came from the fort, and several from the sloop; but a boat, at that distance, presents but a small mark and, although a shot went through the sail, none struck her. Presently a gun boomed out ahead of them, high in the air; and a shot fell near the sloop, which at once hauled her wind, and stood out to sea. \"We have got rid of her,\" Bob said, \"and we are a mile and a half from the fort, now. You can take it easy, men. They won\u0027t waste many more shot upon us.\" Indeed, only one more gun was fired by the Spaniards; and then the boat pursued her course unmolested, Bob returning to his seat at the helm. \"They will be on the lookout for us, as we go back,\" one of the Spaniards said. \"They won\u0027t see you in the dark,\" Bob replied. \"Besides, as likely as not they will think that you are one of the Rock fishing boats, that has ventured out too far, and failed to get back by daylight.\" Once out of reach of the shot from the fort, the sailors laid in their oars--having been rowing for more than ten hours--and the boat glided along quietly, at a distance of a few hundred feet from the foot of the cliff. \"Which are you going to do?\" Bob asked them; \"take fifty dollars for your fish, or sell them for what you can get for them?\" The fishermen at once said they would take the fifty dollars for, although they had collected all that had been brought in by the other fishermen--amounting to some five hundred pounds in weight--they could not imagine that fish, for which they would not have got more than ten dollars--at the outside--at Malaga, could sell for fifty at Gibraltar. As they rounded Europa Point there was a hail from above and, looking up, Bob saw Captain O\u0027Halloran and the doctor. \"Hulloa, Bob!\" \"Hulloa!\" Bob shouted back, and waved his hat. \"All right, Bob?\" \"All right. I have got thirty boxes!\" \"Hurrah!\" the doctor shouted, waving his hat over his head. \"We will meet you at the New Mole. \"That is something like a boy, Gerald!\" \"It is all very well for you,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said. \"You are not responsible for him, and you are not married to his sister.\" \"Put yourself in the way of a cannonball, Gerald, and I will be married to her a week after--if she will have me.\" His companion laughed. \"It is all very well, Teddy; but it is just as well, for you, that you did not show your face up at the house during the last three days. It is not Bob who has been blamed. It has been entirely you and me, especially you. The moment she read his letter, she said at once that you were at the bottom of it, and that it never would have entered Bob\u0027s mind to do such a mad thing, if you had not put him up to it; and of course, when I came back from seeing you, and said that you admitted that you knew what he was doing, it made the case infinitely worse. It will be a long time before she takes you into favour again.\" \"About an hour,\" the doctor said, calmly. \"As soon as she finds that Bob has come back again, with the fruit; and that he has as good as saved the lives of scores of women and children; she will be so proud of him that she will greet me as part author of the credit he has gained--though really, as I told you, I had nothing to do with it except that, when I saw that Bob had made up his mind to try, whether I helped him or not, I thought it best to help him, as far as I could, to get away. \"Now, we must get some porters to carry the boxes up to your house, or wherever he wants them sent. \"Ah! Here is the governor. He will be pleased to hear that Bob has got safely back.\" Captain O\u0027Halloran had, when he found Bob\u0027s letter in his room on the morning after he had left, felt it his duty to go to the town major\u0027s office to mention his absence; and it had been reported to the general, who had sent for Gerald to inquire about the circumstances of the lad\u0027s leaving. Captain O\u0027Halloran had assured him that he knew nothing, whatever, of his intention; and that it was only when he found the letter on his table, saying that he had made up his mind to get beyond the Spanish lines, somehow, and to bring in a boatload of oranges, for the use of the women and children who were suffering from scurvy, that he knew his brother-in-law had any such idea in his mind. \"It is a very gallant attempt, Captain O\u0027Halloran--although, of course, I should not have permitted it to be made, had I been aware of his intentions.\" \"Nor should I, sir,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said. \"My wife is, naturally, very much upset.\" \"That is natural enough,\" the governor said. \"Still, she has every reason to be proud of her brother. A man could risk his life for no higher object than that for which Mr. Repton has undertaken this expedition. \"How do you suppose he got away?\" \"I have no idea, sir. He may have got down by ropes, from the back of the Rock--the way the deserters generally choose.\" \"Yes; but if he got down without breaking his neck, he would still have to pass our line of sentries, and also through the Spaniards.\" \"He is a very good swimmer, general; and may have struck out, and landed beyond the Spanish forts. Of course, he may have started from the Old Mole, and swam across to the head of the bay. He is sure to have thought the matter well out. He is very sharp and, if anyone could get through, I should say Bob could. He speaks the language like a native.\" \"I have heard of him before,\" the governor said, smiling. \"Captain Langton told us of the boy\u0027s doings, when he was away in that privateer brig; and how he took in the frigate, and was the means of the brig capturing those two valuable prizes, and how he had swam on board a Spanish sloop of war. He said that no officer could have shown greater pluck, and coolness. \"I sincerely hope that no harm will come to him; but how--even if he succeeds in getting through the Spanish lines--he can manage, single handed, to get back here in a boat, is more than I can see. Well, I sincerely trust that no harm will come to him.\" As the governor, with two or three of his staff, now came along, Captain O\u0027Halloran went up to him. \"I am glad to say, sir,\" he said, \"that young Repton has just returned, and that he has brought in thirty cases of fruit.\" \"I am extremely glad to hear it, Captain O\u0027Halloran,\" the governor said, warmly. \"When it was reported to me, an hour since, that the Spanish fort and one of their cruisers were firing at a small boat, that was making her way in from the east, the thought struck me that it might be your brother-in-law. \"Where is he?\" \"He is just coming round to the Mole, sir. Doctor Burke and myself are going to meet him.\" \"I will go down with you,\" the governor said. \"Those oranges are worth a thousand pounds a box, to the sick.\" The party reached the Mole before the boat came in; for after rounding the Point she had been becalmed, and the fishermen had lowered the sail and betaken themselves to their oars again. Bob felt a little uncomfortable when, as the boat rowed up to the landing stairs, he saw General Eliott, with a group of officers, standing at the top. He was relieved when, on ascending the steps, the governor stepped forward and shook him warmly by the hand. \"I ought to begin by scolding you, for breaking out of the fortress without leave; but I am too pleased with the success of your venture, and too much gratified at the spirit that prompted you to undertake it, to say a word. Captain O\u0027Halloran tells me that you have brought in thirty cases of fruit.\" \"Yes, sir. I have ten cases of oranges, and twenty of lemons. I propose, with your permission, to send half of these up to the hospitals, for the use of the sick there. The others I intend for the use of the women and children of the garrison, and townspeople. Doctor Burke will see for me that they are distributed where they will do most good.\" \"Well, my lad, I thank you most cordially for your noble gift to the troops; and there is not a man here who will not feel grateful to you, for the relief it will afford to the women and children. I shall be very glad if you will dine with me, today; and you can then tell me how you have managed what I thought, when I first heard of your absence, was a sheer impossibility. \"Captain O\u0027Halloran, I trust that you and Mrs. O\u0027Halloran will also give me the pleasure of your company, at dinner, today.\" \"If you please, sir,\" Bob said, \"will you give these two boatmen a pass, permitting them to go out after dark, tonight. I promised them that they should not be detained. It is of the greatest importance to them that they should get back before their absence is discovered.\" \"Certainly,\" the governor said; and at once ordered one of the officers of the staff to see that the pass was given; and orders issued, to the officers of the batteries, to allow the boat to pass out in the dark, unquestioned. As soon as the governor walked away, with his staff, Bob was heartily greeted by Captain O\u0027Halloran and the doctor. \"You have given us a fine fright, Bob,\" the former said, \"and your sister has been in a desperate way about you. However, now that you have come back safe, I suppose she will forgive you. \"But what about all those fish? Are they yours? Why, there must be half a ton of them!\" \"No; the men say there are five or six hundred pounds. \"Yes, they are mine. I thought of keeping a few for ourselves, and dividing the rest between the ten regiments; and sending them up, with your compliments, to their messes.\" \"Not with my compliments, Bob; that would be ridiculous. Send them up with your own compliments. It will be a mighty acceptable present. But you had better pick out two or three of the finest fish, and send them up to the governor. \"Now then, let us set to work. Here are plenty of porters but, first of all, we had better get ten men from the officer of the guard here; and send one off, with each of the porters with the fish, to the regiments--or the chances are that these baskets will be a good bit lighter, by the time they arrive there, than when they start. I will go and ask the officer; while you are getting the fish up here, and divided.\" In a quarter of an hour the ten porters started, each with about half a hundredweight, and under the charge of a soldier. The doctor took charge of the porters with the fifteen boxes of fruit, for the various hospitals; and then--after Bob had paid the boatmen the two hundred and fifty dollars due to them, and had told them they would get the permit to enable them to sail again, as soon as it became dark--he and Captain O\u0027Halloran started for the house, with the men in charge of the other fifteen boxes, and with one carrying the remaining fish--which weighed about the same as the other parcels. \"How did you and the doctor happen to be at Europa Point, Gerald?\" Bob asked, as they went along. \"The doctor said he felt sure that whenever you did come--that is, if you came at all--you would get here somewhere about daylight; and he arranged with the officer in charge of the upper battery to send a man down, with the news, if there was a boat in sight. Directly he heard that the Spaniards were firing at a boat, he came over and called me; and we went round to the back of the Rock. We couldn\u0027t be sure that it was you from that height but, as we could make out the boxes, we thought it must be you; and so walked down to the Point, to catch you there.\" \"Does Carrie know that a boat was in sight?\" \"No, I wouldn\u0027t say anything to her about it. She had only just dropped off to sleep, when I was called. She woke up, and asked what it was; but I said that I supposed I was wanted on duty, and she went off again before I was dressed. I was glad she did, for she hadn\u0027t closed her eyes before, since you started.\" Carrie was on the terrace when she saw Bob and Gerald, followed by a procession of porters, coming up the hill. With a cry of joy she ran down into the house, and out to meet them. \"You bad boy!\" she cried, as she threw her arms round Bob\u0027s neck. \"How could you frighten us so? It is very cruel and wicked of you, Bob, and I am not going to forgive you; though I can\u0027t help being glad to see you, which is more than you deserve.\" \"You mustn\u0027t scold him, Carrie,\" her husband said. \"Even the governor didn\u0027t scold him; and he has thanked him, in the name of the whole garrison, and he has asked him to dine with him; and you and I are to dine there too, Carrie. There is an honour for you! But what is better than honour is that there isn\u0027t a woman and child on the Rock who won\u0027t be feeling deeply grateful to Bob, before the day is over.\" \"Has he really got some fruit?\" \"Yes. Don\u0027t you see the boxes, Carrie?\" \"Oh, I saw something coming along, but I didn\u0027t see anything clearly but Bob. What are these boxes--oranges?\" \"Oranges and lemons--five of oranges and ten of lemons--and there are as many more that have gone up to the hospital, for the use of the men. \"There, let us see them taken into the storeroom. You can open two of them at once, and send Manola off with a big basket; and tell her to give half a dozen of each, with your love, to each of the ladies you know. The doctor will take charge of the rest, and see about their division among all the women on the Rock. It will be quite a business, but he won\u0027t mind it.\" \"What is all this--fish?\" \"Well, my dear, you are to take as much as you want; and you are to pick out two or three of the best, and send them to the governor, with your compliments; and the rest you can divide and send out, with the fruit, to your special friends.\" \"But how has Bob done it?\" Carrie asked, quite overwhelmed at the sight of all those welcome stores. \"Ah, that he must tell you, himself. I have no more idea than the man in the moon.\" \"It has all been quite simple,\" Bob said. \"But see about sending these things off first, Carrie. Doctor Burke will be here, after he has seen the others taken safely to the hospital; and I shall have to tell it all over again, then.\" \"I am very angry with the doctor,\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran said. \"Then the sooner you get over being angry, the better, Carrie. The doctor had nothing whatever to do with my going; but when he saw that I had made up my mind to go, he helped me, and I am extremely obliged to him. Now, you may have an orange for yourself, if you are good.\" \"That I won\u0027t,\" Carrie said. \"Thanks to our eggs and vegetables we are perfectly well and, when there are so many people really in want of the oranges, it would be downright wicked to eat them merely because we like them.\" In a short time Manola--with two of the children from downstairs, carrying baskets--started, with the presents of fruit and fish, to all the ladies of Carrie\u0027s acquaintance. Soon after she had left, Doctor Burke arrived. \"I was not going to speak to you, Teddy Burke,\" Mrs. O\u0027Halloran said, shaking her head at him. \"I had lost confidence in you; but with Bob back again, and all this fruit for the poor creatures who want it, I will forgive you.\" \"I am glad you have grace enough for that, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran. It is down on your knees you ought to go, to thank me, if I had my rights. Isn\u0027t Bob a hero? And hasn\u0027t he received the thanks of the governor? And hasn\u0027t he saved scores of lives, this blessed day? And although it is little enough I had to do with it, isn\u0027t it the thanks of the whole garrison ought to be given me, for even the little bit of a share I had in it?\" \"We have been waiting for you to come, Teddy,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said, \"to hear Bob\u0027s story.\" \"Well then, you will have to wait a bit longer,\" the doctor said. \"I have sent orderlies from the hospital to all the regiments--including, of course, the Artillery and Engineers--asking them to send me lists of the numbers of the women and children of the noncommissioned officers and privates, and also of officers\u0027 wives and families; and to send with the lists, here, two orderlies from each regiment, with baskets. I have been down to the town major, and got a list of the number of women and children in the town. When we get the returns from the regiments, we will reckon up the totals; and see how many there will be, for each. I think that each of the boxes holds about five hundred.\" The work of counting out the oranges and lemons for the various regiments, and the townspeople, occupied some time; and it was not until the orderlies had started, with their supplies, that Bob sat down to tell his story. \"Nothing could have been easier,\" he said, when he finished. \"It was easy enough, as you say, Bob,\" the doctor said; \"but it required a lot of coolness, and presence of mind. Events certainly turned out fortunately for you, but you took advantage of them. That is always the point. Nobody could have done it better, and most people would have done worse. I have been wondering myself a great deal, since you have been gone, what plan you could possibly hit on to get the oranges into a boat; and how, when you had got them in, you would manage to get them here. It seems all easy enough, now you have done it; but that is all the more creditable to you, for hitting on a plan that worked so well.\" Similar praise was given to Bob when he had again to tell his story, at the governor\u0027s. \"So you managed, you say, to slip out with the reliefs?\" the governor said. \"Yes, sir. I had got a military cloak, and hat.\" \"Still, it is curious that they did not notice an addition to their party. I fancy you must have had a friend there?\" \"That, general, is a point that I would rather not say anything about. That is the way that I did go out and, when I took to the water, I let the coat and hat float away for, had they been found, it might have been supposed that somebody had deserted.\" \"I wish you could have brought in a shipload, instead of a boatload, of fruit, Mr. Repton. They will be of immense benefit to the sick but, unfortunately, there is scarcely a person on the Rock that is not more or less affected and, if your thirty boxes were multiplied by a hundred, it would be none too much for our needs.\" The oranges and lemons did, however, for a time have a marked effect in checking the progress of the scurvy--especially among the children, who came in for a larger share than that which fell to the sick soldiers--but in another month the condition of those in hospital, and indeed of many who still managed to do duty, was again pitiable. On the 11th of October, however, some of the boats of the fleet went out, during a fog, and boarded a Danish craft from Malaga--laden with oranges and lemons--and brought her in. The cargo was at once bought by the governor, and distributed. The beneficial effects were immediate. Cases which had, but a few days before, appeared hopeless were cured, as if by magic; and the health of the whole garrison was reestablished. Heavy rains setting in at the same time, the gardens--upon which, for months, great attention had been bestowed--came rapidly into bearing and, henceforth, throughout the siege the supply of vegetables, if not ample for the needs of the garrison and inhabitants, was sufficient to prevent scurvy from getting any strong hold again. A few days after the ship with oranges was brought in, an orderly came in to Captain O\u0027Halloran with a message that the governor wished to speak to Mr. Repton. Bob was out at the time, but went up to the castle as soon as he returned, and was at once shown in to the governor. Illustration: Bob receives a Commission from the Governor. \"Mr. Repton,\" the latter began, \"after the spirit you showed, the other day, I shall be glad to utilize your services still farther, if you are willing.\" \"I shall be very glad to be useful in any work upon which you may think fit to employ me, sir.\" \"I wish to communicate with Mr. Logie, at Tangiers,\" the governor said. \"It is a month, now, since we have had any news from him. At the time he last wrote, he said that the Emperor of Morocco was manifesting an unfriendly spirit towards us; and that he was certainly in close communication with the Spaniards, and had allowed their ships to take more than one English vessel lying under the guns of the town. His own position was, he said, little better than that of a prisoner--for he was closely watched. \"He still hoped, however, to bring the emperor round again to our side; as he had, for years, exercised a considerable influence over him. If he would grant him an interview, Mr. Logie thought that he might still be able to clear up any doubts of us that the Spaniards might have infused in his mind. Since that letter we have heard nothing from him, and we are ignorant how matters stand, over there. \"The matter is important; for although, while the enemy\u0027s cruisers are as vigilant as at present, there is little hope of our getting fresh meat over from there, I am unable to give any directions to such privateers, or others, as may find their way in here. It makes all the difference to them whether the Morocco ports are open to them, or not. Until lately, when chased they could run in there, wait for a brisk east wind, and then start after dark, and be fairly through the Straits before morning. \"I am very desirous, therefore, of communicating with Mr. Logie. I am also anxious, not only about his safety, but of that of several English families there; among whom are those of some of the officers of the garrison who--thinking that they would be perfectly safe in Tangiers, and avoid the hardships and dangers of the siege--despatched them across the Straits by the native craft that came in, when first the port was closed. \"Thinking it over, it appeared to me that you would be far more fitted than most for this mission, if you would accept it. You have already shown yourself able to pass as a Spaniard and, should you find that things have gone badly in Tangiers, and that the Moors have openly joined the Spaniards; you might be able to get a passage to Lisbon, in a neutral ship, and to return thence in the first privateer, or ship of war, bound for this port. I would of course provide you with a document, requesting the officer in command of any such ship to give you a passage. Should no such neutral ship come along, I should trust to you to find your way across to Tarifa or Algeciras; and thence to manage in some way, which I must leave to your own ingenuity, to make your way in. \"I do not disguise from you that the commission is a very dangerous, as well as an honourable one; as were you, an Englishman, detected on Spanish soil, you would almost certainly be executed as a spy.\" \"I am ready to undertake the commission, sir, and I am much obliged to you for affording me the opportunity of being of service. It is irksome for me to remain here, in idleness, when there are many young officers of my own age doing duty in the batteries. As to the risk, I am quite prepared to run it. It will be exactly such an adventure as I should choose.\" \"Very well, Mr. Repton. Then I will send you the despatches, this evening; together with a letter recommending you to all British officers and authorities. Both will be written on the smallest pieces of paper possible, so that you may conceal them more easily. \"Now, as to the means. There are many of the fishermen here would be glad to leave. The firing in the bay has frightened the greater part of the fish away and, besides, the boats dare not go any distance from the Rock. I have caused inquiries to be made, and have given permits to three men to leave the Rock in a boat, after nightfall, and to take their chance of getting through the enemy\u0027s cruisers. It is likely to be a very dark night. I have arranged with them to take a passenger across to Tangiers, and have given them permission to take two others with them. We know that there are many Jews, and others, most anxious to leave the town before the enemy begin to bombard it; and the men will doubtless get a good price, from two of these, to carry them across the Straits. \"You will form an idea, for yourself, whether these boatmen are trustworthy. If you conclude that they are, you can make a bargain with them, or with any others, to bring you back direct. I authorize you to offer them a hundred pounds for doing so. \"Come up here at eight o\u0027clock this evening. I will have the despatches ready for you then. You will understand that if you find the Moors have become absolutely hostile, and have a difficulty in getting at Mr. Logie, you are not to run any risk in trying to deliver the despatches; as the information you will be able to obtain will be sufficient for me, without any confirmation from him.\" After further conversation, Bob took his leave of the governor. On his return home, Carrie was very vexed, when she heard the mission that Bob had undertaken and, at first, it needed all her husband\u0027s persuasions to prevent her going off to the governor\u0027s, to protest against it. \"Why, my dear, you would make both yourself and Bob ridiculous. Surely he is of an age, now, to go his own way without petticoat government. He has already gained great credit, both in his affair with the privateer, and in fetching in the oranges the other day. This is far less dangerous. Here he has only got to smuggle himself in, there he had to bring back something like a ton of oranges. It is a great honour for the governor to have chosen him. And as to you opposing it, the idea is absurd!\" \"I shall go round to Major Harcourt,\" Bob said. \"Mrs. Harcourt is terribly anxious about her daughter, and I am sure she will be glad to send a letter over to her.\" \"Carrie,\" Captain O\u0027Halloran said gravely, \"I have become a sudden convert to your opinion regarding this expedition. Suppose that Bob, instead of coming back, were to carry Amy Harcourt off to England? It would be terrible! I believe that Mr. Logie, as His Majesty\u0027s consul, could perform the necessary ceremony before they sailed.\" Bob laughed. \"I should doubt whether Mr. Logie would have power to officiate, in the case of minors. Besides, there is an English church, where the banns could be duly published. No, I think we must put that off, Gerald.\" Amy Harcourt was the daughter of one of the O\u0027Hallorans\u0027 most intimate friends: and the girl, who was about fifteen years old, was often at their house with her mother. She had suffered much from the heat, early in June; and her parents had, at a time when the Spanish cruisers had somewhat relaxed their vigilance, sent her across to Tangiers in one of the traders. She was in the charge of Mrs. Colomb, the wife of an officer of the regiment, who was also going across for her health. They intended to stay at Tangiers only for a month, or six weeks; but Mrs. Colomb had become worse, and was, when the last news came across, too ill to be moved. Major and Mrs. Harcourt had consequently become very anxious about Amy, the feeling being much heightened by the rumours of the hostile attitude of the emperor towards the English. Mrs. Harcourt gladly availed herself of the opportunity that Bob\u0027s mission offered. \"I shall be glad, indeed, if you will take a letter, Mr. Repton. I am in great trouble about her. If anything should happen to Mrs. Colomb, her position would be extremely awkward. I know that Mr. Logie will do the best he can for her but, for aught we know, he and all the English there may, at present, be prisoners among the Moors. I need not say how bitterly her father and I have regretted that we let her go; and yet, it seemed by far the best thing, at the time, for she would get an abundance of fresh meat, food and vegetables. \"Of course, you will see how she is situated, when you get there; and I am sure you will give her the best advice you can, as to what she is to do. Not knowing how they are placed there, we can do literally nothing; and you managed that fruit business so splendidly that I feel very great confidence in you.\" \"I am sure I shall be glad to do anything that I can, Mrs. Harcourt; and if it had been a boy, I daresay we could have managed something between us--but you see, girls are different.\" \"Oh, you won\u0027t find any difficulty with her. I often tell her she is as much of a boy, at present, as she is a girl. Amy has plenty of sense. I shall tell her, in my letter, about your going out to fetch in the fruit for the women and children. She is inclined to look up to you very much, already, owing to the share you had in the capture of those Spanish vessels; and I am sure she will listen to any advice you give her.\" \"Well, I will do my best, Mrs. Harcourt,\" Bob said, meekly; \"but I have never had anything to do with girls, except my sister; and she gives the advice, always, and not me.\" \"By what she says, Bob, I don\u0027t think you always take it,\" Mrs. Harcourt said, smiling. \"Well, not quite always,\" Bob admitted. \"Women are constantly afraid that you are going to hurt yourself, or something, just as if a boy had got no sense. \"Well, I will do what I can, Mrs. Harcourt. I am sure I hope that I shall find them all right, over there.\" \"I hope so, too,\" Mrs. Harcourt said. \"I will see Captain Colomb. He will be sure to give you a letter for his wife. I shall talk it over with him and, if he thinks that she had better go straight home, if any opportunity offers, I shall tell Amy to go with her; and stay with my sister, at Gloucester, till the siege is over, and then she can come out again to us. I will bring you down the letters, myself, at seven o\u0027clock.\" From her, Bob went to Dr. Burke. \"I have just come from your house, Bob. I found your sister in a despondent state about you. I assured her you had as many lives as a cat; and could only be considered to have used up two or three of them, yet, and were safe for some years to come. I hinted that you had more to fear from a rope than either drowning or shooting. That made her angry, and did her good. However, it was better for me to be off; and I thought, most likely, that you would be coming round for a talk. \"So you are going officially, this time. Well, what disguise are you going to take?\" \"That is what I have been thinking of. What would you recommend, doctor?\" \"Well, the choice is not a very extensive one. You can hardly go as you are because, if the Moors have joined the Spaniards, you would be arrested as soon as you landed. Gerald tells me that, probably, two of the Jew traders will go away with you. If so, I should say you could not do better than dress in their style. There are many of them Rock scorpions, and talk Spanish and English equally well; but I should say that you had better take another disguise.\" \"That is what I was thinking,\" Bob said. \"The boatman will know that I have something to do with the governor, and the two Jews will certainly know that I don\u0027t belong to the Rock. If they find that the Moors have joined the Spaniards, these Jews may try to get through, themselves, by denouncing me. I should say I had better get clothes with which I can pass as a Spanish sailor, or fisherman. There are almost sure to be Spanish ships, in there. There is a good deal of trade between Tangiers and Spain. \"Then again, I shall want my own clothes if I have to take passage in a neutral, to Lisbon. So I should say that I had better go down to the town, and get a sort of trader\u0027s suit, and a fisherman\u0027s, at one of the low slop shops. Then I will go as a trader, to start with; and carry the other two suits in a bag.\" \"That will be a very good plan, Bob. You are not likely to be noticed much, when you land. There are always ships anchored there, waiting for a wind to carry them out. They must be accustomed to sailors, of all sorts of nationalities, in the streets. However, I hope you will find no occasion for any clothes, after you land, but your own. The Moors have always been good friends of ours; and the emperor must know that the Spaniards are very much more dangerous neighbours than we are, and I can hardly believe he will be fool enough to throw us over. \"I will go down with you, to buy these things.\" Bob had no difficulty in procuring the clothes he required at a secondhand shop, and then took the lot home with him. Carrie had, by this time, become more reconciled to what could not be avoided; and she laughed when Dr. Burke came in. \"You are like a bad penny, Teddy Burke. It is no use trying to get rid of you.\" \"Not the least bit in the world, Mrs. O\u0027Halloran. Fortunately, I know that, however hard you are upon me, you don\u0027t mean what you say.\" \"I do mean it, very much; but after you are gone I say to myself, \u0027It is only Teddy Burke,\u0027 and think no more of it.\" That evening, at nine o\u0027clock, Bob embarked on board the fishing boat, at the New Mole. One of the governor\u0027s aides-de-camp accompanied him, to pass him through all the guards; and orders had been sent, to the officers in command of the various batteries, that the boat was not to be challenged. It was to show a light from a lantern, as it went along, in order that it might be known. The other two passengers and the boatmen had been sitting there since before gunfire, and they were glad enough when Bob came down and took his seat in the stern, taking the tiller ropes. The oars had been muffled, and they put off noiselessly. When they got past Europa Point they found a light breeze blowing, and at once laid in their oars, and hoisted sail. A vigilant lookout was kept. Once or twice they thought they made out the hulls of anchored vessels, but they gave these a wide berth and, when the morning broke, were halfway across the Strait, heading directly for Tangiers. In another six hours they entered the port. There were half a dozen vessels lying in the harbour. Four of these were flying Spanish colours, one was a Dane, and the other a Dutchman. From the time morning broke, Bob had been narrowly examining his fellow passengers, and the boatmen; and came to the conclusion that none of them were to be trusted. As soon as he stepped ashore, with his bag in his hand, he walked swiftly away and, passing through the principal streets, which were crowded with Moors, held steadily on, without speaking to anyone, until he reached the outskirts of the town; and then struck off among the hedges and gardens. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3143/86383.html","bookId":813,"book":{"id":813,"title":"Held Fast For England","description":"简介： The Siege of Gibraltar stands almost alone in the annals of warfare, alike in its duration and in the immense preparations made, by the united powers of France and Spain, for the capture of the fortress.
