If I do, I might see she\u0027s upset because a non-Jewish girl is her granddaughter. I don\u0027t know how Israelis feel about non-Jews. For some reason I don\u0027t want to know if she resents me. \u0027Cause I like Safta. A lot.\\n\\n \"Look at me, my sweet Amy.\"\\n\\n Me? Sweet? I raise my eyes and look straight at her.\\n\\n She\u0027s smiling, the wrinkles around her eyes making deep creases as she takes my hand in hers, the one still holding the necklace with the small Jewish star pendant.\\n\\n \"Being Jewish is more in your heart than in your mind. For some, being Jewish is strictly following the laws and customs of our ancestors. For others, it\u0027s being part of a community. Religion is very personal. It will always be there for you if you want or need it. You can choose to embrace it or decide your life doesn\u0027t need it. Nobody can force religion on you or it\u0027s not real.\"\\n\\n Looking down at the necklace in my hand, I say, \"Can I keep it? Just for a little while. I\u0027ll give it back, I promise.\"\\n\\n She pats the top of my head. \"I used to wonder why my son stayed away from Israel for so long, but I see the way he looks at you. He wants to protect you, keep you from hurt or harm while trying to respect that inner fire you possess. It is genuine and pure. Take the necklace,\" she says, then hesitates before adding, \"for as long as you want it.\"\\n\\n Staring at this woman, who has eyes that mirror mine and who says words that turn my world upside down, disturbs my inner being. I clutch the necklace in my hand. Then I turn around and head for the refrigerator, looking for some water. Even though it\u0027s right in front of my face as I open the door, my limbs feel paralyzed.\\n\\n I close the fridge and turn to Safta as I walk toward the door.\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027ll take a walk,\" I say.\\n\\n I take one more look at the necklace before gently placing it in my back pocket.\\n\\n I find myself walking toward the sheep. When I get close to the pens, the\\n\\n Ferragamo-stealing mutt bounds toward me. Its filthy tail is wagging furiously, fanning his behind. Remembering my toes filled with snake-guts, I walk right past the dog and ignore its pathetic attempts at making up with me.\\n\\n \"Arg!\"\\n\\n I look down at the thing. \"Arg, yourself. Where\u0027s my sandal?\"\\n\\n \"Arg!\" Wag. \"Arg!\" Wag.\\n\\n He trots off toward a hilly area beyond the pens and I think of how lucky that dog is to be free to do as he pleases. Even steal other people\u0027s shoes without repercussions.\\n\\n I walk farther into the pens, the sound of baying sheep and electric razors leading me in the right direction. Spotting Ron, I head toward him. I convince myself that as long as I just hang out here, there\u0027s no reason Ron will think I\u0027m incompetent and regret I\u0027m his daughter.\\n\\n \"Amy, honey, over here!\"\\n\\n My eyes wander to the direction of Ron\u0027s voice. He\u0027s never called me honey before and it kind of startles me. What does that mean, anyway? Honey. It\u0027s sweet, but it\u0027s also sticky and doesn\u0027t come off your hands easily. Annoy-ingly sweet. Is that me? Not on your life.\\n\\n He\u0027s leaning down, and his knees are locking a sheep down while he\u0027s shearing its wooly hair off. The sheep doesn\u0027t seem to mind, but I do.\\n\\n \"Ron, that\u0027s inhumane,\" I say.\\n\\n He finishes running the razor through the sheep\u0027s fur while the fluff falls beside him. He finally releases the poor, naked animal and looks up at me.\\n\\n \"You have a better way?\" he asks.\\n\\n It\u0027s then I realize Ron isn\u0027t the only one shearing the sheep. O\u0027dead is next to Ron,\\n\\n Doo-Doo is next to O\u0027dead, Uncle Chime is next to Doo-Doo, and Avi is next to my uncle. They\u0027re all exhausted, I can tell by the way they\u0027re breathing heavily and their shirts are wet with sweat. Not just their armpits and chests, their entire shirts are soaked through.\\n\\n And they\u0027re all staring at me. Except O\u0027dead. He\u0027s staring at Snotty, across in another pen. Hmmm.\\n\\n The razor sounds stop and I feel like the world has, too. I think of something quick to say.\\n\\n It comes to me like lightning and I blurt out, \"Why don\u0027t you just leave the fur on?\"\\n\\n Duh. It sounds so simple I give a short laugh.\\n\\n Chuckles from my right side alert me to my cousin and Ofra. Snotty\u0027s wearing a tight black shirt and her dark makeup is running down her cheeks while feeding a lamb with a bottle. Hasn\u0027t she ever heard of waterproof mascara? Or the term less is more?\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll be too hot during summer months,\" Ron explains.\\n\\n I sit down on one of the metal railings and watch. There are dogs in the middle of the pens, eating something red and gooey on the ground. My lips curl.\\n\\n \"What are the dogs eating?\" I ask. Maybe I don\u0027t want to know, but my curiosity gets the best of me.\\n\\n \"One of the female sheep had a baby this morning.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re eating a lamb?\"\\n\\n \"No, the placenta. It\u0027s very nutritious.\"\\n\\n I gag. \"Eww!\" I say.\\n\\n I shouldn\u0027t have asked. If I hadn\u0027t asked, I wouldn\u0027t know. GROSS! Baby sheep placenta. Blech! Stop thinking about it. Stop thinking about it.\\n\\n But the more I will myself to stop thinking about it the more I can\u0027t look away. Kind of like those bloody crime scenes they show on television. You don\u0027t want to watch, but can\u0027t help it.\\n\\n Out of the corner of my eye I see Mutt coming into the enclosure. He\u0027s small enough to go under the metal railings. When he looks at me, I squint at him.\\n\\n \"Do NOT eat sheep placenta,\" I tell him.\\n\\n He nods at me, as if he understands what I just said. Then he tromps over to the placenta, starts to lick it, takes a part of the gooey, bloody thing in his mouth and tugs at it. I can\u0027t look any more.\\n\\n If only Jessica were here, we could have a huge laugh at the whole grody situation. But she\u0027s not.\\n\\n I walk over to where the newborn sheep are. A baby lamb stumbles over to me and I pet it with my hand.\\n\\n \"Hey sweetheart,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Baa,\" it whines back, which makes me smile.\\n\\n I think it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve smiled since Matan put the flowers in my hair.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t get too attached, he\u0027s going to be killed soon.\"\\n\\n My heart sinks and my smile fades as quickly as it appeared. I turn to Snotty while I pick up the baby lamb.\\n\\n \"What?\" I say.\\n\\n \"We have them slaughtered at three months old. That one\u0027s a boy so he\u0027ll be one of the first to go.\"\\n\\n I look into the eyes of the small, helpless newborn and pull it closer to me protectively.\\n\\n I\u0027m a carnivore. Although meeting the animal I\u0027m going to eat up close and personal makes me sick to my stomach. He\u0027s so cute. How can I even think about the poor guy being slaughtered? Maybe I won\u0027t cut out carbs after all.\\n\\n Matan comes trotting up the lane with Doda Yucky behind him. He\u0027s naked, as usual. What\u0027s funny is I\u0027m getting so used to seeing the kid naked that it doesn\u0027t even faze me.\\n\\n He comes into the pen and runs around with the lambs. He\u0027s screeching in delight as he runs and tries to catch them.\\n\\n After a minute the lambs start running after him. But it\u0027s not to play, I realize they think his little pee-wee is another baby bottle nipple. He\u0027s laughing and running away from the lambs that are trying to get milk out of his thingy like it\u0027s a game. Looking around, I notice Doda Yucky is laughing, as well as the rest of the people who have now stopped shearing the sheep.\\n\\n I run over to Matan and pick his naked little body up to protect him from the perverted lambs.\\n\\n After I carry him back to safety, I say very loudly to anyone who can hear me, \"That. Is. Not. Okay.\"\\n\\n Matan isn\u0027t fazed, neither is anyone else. They\u0027re still laughing. Doda Yucky talks to Uncle Chime before she and Matan trot happily back to the house, thank goodness.\\n\\n The razors start up again, all the men except for Ron bending over the poor sheep. He says something to Uncle Chime in Hebrew before coming over to me.\\n\\n \"I have a job for you,\" he says.\\n\\n CHAPTER 14\\n\\n Determination and skill is half of the job. Dumb luck is the other half.\\n\\n I follow him to the other end of the enclosure, which is thankfully in the shade.\\n\\n \"When the sheeps are done being sheared, herd them into this pen.\"\\n\\n I look over at the skinny, bare-assed animal. Man, they looked so fat, puffy, and large with all that fuzzy hair, it\u0027s unbelievable how much smaller and vulnerable they look after a shave. I can just sense their self-consciousness as a shiver runs through my bones.\\n\\n But I\u0027m determined to help. I think. Don\u0027t screw this up, Amy. My eyes wander to Snotty, feeding the baby animals with bottles of milk. That looks like fun. Why do I get stuck with herding the bare-assed ones into a pen?\\n\\n What if they start getting frisky with me? Worse, what if they start getting frisky with each other? Blech!\\n\\n \"You able to do it?\" Ron asks.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" I say with more conviction than I feel. \"Piece of cake,\" I add.\\n\\n If I do this, maybe he\u0027ll be proud of me.\\n\\n Uncle Chime lets one of the sheep go and it struggles to its feet. It\u0027s a male one, I can tell by the dangling thing in between its legs. And he\u0027s staring at me from the corner of the pen.\\n\\n \"Go on,\" I say.\\n\\n But above the buzzing of the shearing I bet he can\u0027t hear me.\\n\\n The sheep stares at me with his big, spooky, gray eyes. I wonder if he\u0027ll charge me. I move a step closer. He doesn\u0027t move.\\n\\n \"Go on,\" I say a bit louder this time.\\n\\n Sincerely hoping nobody is watching me, I take another step toward the animal.\\n\\n He backs up.\\n\\n \"This way, dummy,\" I say.\\n\\n The thing won\u0027t listen to me. Damn. I look over at Ron, but thankfully he\u0027s not paying attention.\\n\\n It\u0027s me against the sheep. Did I say the thing looked small and vulnerable after being shaved? I take that back. Before I step toward the menacing four-legged, bare-assed sheep with a dangling thing between its legs, out of the corner of my eye I see another sheep stand up. It heads next to the first one. Now I have two to deal with.\\n\\n Avi stands up and heads over to get another fuzzy, fur-filled sheep to shear. As he does, our eyes meet. I still haven\u0027t forgiven him for the snake-guts incident. It\u0027s unbelievable he won\u0027t apologize for watching me while I was as naked as the sheep he\u0027s shearing. Kind of ironic, isn\u0027t it? I plead to him with my eyes, Help me.\\n\\n He looks back at me with contempt. Not on your life, Amy. You\u0027re on your own. Jerk. Not that he actually voiced those words, but I know he was thinking it.\\n\\n Screw him. I take another step toward the two sheep. Maybe if I channel their psyche they\u0027ll do what I want. I open my eyes wide and look at the bigger one intently. Go inside the pen, I urge with my mind. Focus, Amy, I tell myself. I put my fingertips on my temples in order to channel my thoughts to the damn four-legged creature who\u0027s looking at me like I\u0027m a nutcase.\\n\\n I feel a presence standing beside me. Turning abruptly, I almost knock into Avi. The confused expression on his face, with furrowed eyebrows and chocolate irises, tells me he thinks I\u0027m a mashed potato (which, just in case you aren\u0027t familiar with the slang term, means a brainless human being).\\n\\n \"Yah!\" he yells while stomping his foot on the ground. This coming from a guy who thinks I\u0027m a mashed potato.\\n\\n I turn back to the sheep, who have now just run into the adjacent pen at his command/stomp routine.\\n\\n Avi\u0027s got this arrogant smirk on his face like he\u0027s done some massive accomplishment.\\n\\n \"I bet your boyfriend can\u0027t do that,\" he says. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-11.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) \\n Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. \\n Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close.
