{"id":85619,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\"I wouldn\u0027t be called a daddy\u0027s girl, if that\u0027s what you mean,\" I say. \"In fact, I\u0027m not close to anyone in my family. My mom\u0027s kind of in her own world and Ron isn\u0027t exactly the best father. I don\u0027t even have a cousin who likes me. Well, Besides your brother, but he can\u0027t even speak English. If he did he probably wouldn\u0027t like me, either.\"\n \"You aren\u0027t exactly the funnest person around,\" Osnat says.\n \"Are you kidding? I have a lot to offer,\" I say. \"For example, I can show you how to put on makeup so it won\u0027t look overdone and won\u0027t smear. I\u0027m a whiz when it comes to hairstyles, I can even French braid hair. And I can beat most people I know in tennis. What have you got to offer?\" I ask, putting my hands on my hips as I wait for an answer.\n \"I can ride a horse bareback and I\u0027m really good at dancing. And I\u0027m a great person once you get to know me,\" she says, absolutely certain she\u0027s won me over.\n I can imagine riding a horse bareback isn\u0027t much different from riding in that Jeep on the rocks, but it does have merit.\n \"And?\"\n \"And I can tell you Avi has changed since he met you. He smiles now ...something rare since his brother died. I guess I don\u0027t mind you\u0027ve gotten together since you make him happy.\"\n We hug and I feel lucky to have a cousin who can ride bareback. And to be a friend, too.\n CHAPTER 29\n The threat of taking something away makes us appreciate it more.\n Two days later, all seven of us are back in the Jeep heading back to the moshav. I\u0027m anxious to see Ron and tell him I want a fresh start.\n We all enter Osnat\u0027s house and it seems like the whole neighborhood is crowded inside. And they all have their eyes glued to the television screen. I see my little curlyhead cousin Matan and Doda Yucky. I don\u0027t see Ron or Uncle Chime.\n The mood is definitely somber.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" I ask. I can\u0027t understand the newscaster who is obviously covering a very important story.\n The house erupts with Hebrew, everyone explaining to Osnat, Ofra, Avi, Doo-Doo, O\u0027dead, and Moron what they\u0027re so upset about. Except I don\u0027t understand any of it.\n \"There\u0027s been a bombing,\" Avi explains to me after listening to the others. \"In Tel Aviv.\"\n \"Where\u0027s my dad?\" I ask in a panic. \"Where\u0027s Ron?\" I need him now more than ever.\n Avi pulls me into an embrace. \"Amy, it\u0027ll be fine.\"\n Tears fill my eyes and I say again, this time directing the question to Doda Yucky, \"Where is he?\"\n I don\u0027t get an answer and I feel bile rising to my throat. I pull back from Avi \u0027cause I want to throw up.\n \"Your aba drove to Tel Aviv with Chime to deliver some meat to some restaurants there,\" she explains.\n \"They\u0027re fine, right, Doda Yucky?\" I say, crying fully now and not caring a bit.\n Tears are running down her face, too. \"I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s a lot of confusion. After one bombing, people ran to help ... a second bomber ...\"\n \"Ohmygod,\" I say.\n I may not know Ron well, but I definitely know if people were hurt, he would be one of the first to run and help. The second bomber ... I can\u0027t think about it.\n \"We don\u0027t know where they are,\" she says. \"The cell phone isn\u0027t working.\"\n Going into Osnat\u0027s room, I frantically rummage through my backpack. In one of my jean pockets I fish out the Jewish star Safta gave me. The diamonds are shining back at me, almost as if telling me I\u0027m a Jew just like the rest of my family. We\u0027ve survived thousands of years even though we\u0027ve suffered through most of them, I remind myself.\n Walking back into the main room, I put my hands over my face. I don\u0027t want anyone looking at me right now. I feel so helpless. How many people were injured or died today? I feel sick just thinking about it. I try to push the image of Ron\u0027s body lying in the street out of my mind. But what if he\u0027s dead and I wasn\u0027t there to help him? I need strength because I think I\u0027ve lost all of mine. I put my hands down and my gaze rests on Avi.\n I need him.\n I need him so much I don\u0027t know what to do with myself.\n \"Avi,\" I say as I run into his chest and hold him tight. \"Please don\u0027t leave me; I don\u0027t think I can handle this without you.\"\n \"I\u0027m here,\" he assures me in a soft voice as he strokes my hair. \"And I\u0027m not leaving.\"\n That\u0027s right, he lost his brother in a bombing. He must be rehashing the pain of his own loss. We can help each other through this.\n Holding out the necklace to him I say, \"Will you put this on me?\"\n We wait the longest hour of my life as Avi and I sit by Sofia in her room and avoid watching the news report. She tells me about her childhood in Israel and her experience when she first came to what she calls \u0027the holy land\u0027. She\u0027s scared, I can tell. The loss of two sons would devastate her.\n When the phone rings, I jump up and run to the kitchen.\n Doda Yucky is on the phone, and she looks directly at me as she answers it.\n My heart is racing.\n \"Amy,\" she says, and I lean against Avi for support as I\u0027m preparing for bad news. \"It\u0027s your mudder.\"\n My mudder! I hurry to the phone and clutch it to my ear. \"Mom!\"\n \"Hi, sweetheart. I heard on the news there\u0027s been a bombing in Israel. I\u0027m just calling to make sure you\u0027re okay. Jessica called and she\u0027s worried, too.\"\n \"I\u0027m ...I\u0027m okay,\" I say, barely able to make the words out through my sobs. \"But ... I was traveling and Ron was in Tel Aviv ...and we haven\u0027t heard from him and I\u0027m freaking out. I don\u0027t know what to do. We\u0027re waiting for a phone call but...\"\n \"Oh, no. This is terrible, I never thought--\"\n \"Mom, I got to get off the phone in case he calls.\"\n \"Okay, okay,\" she says in a panic. \"I\u0027ll hang up. Call me back when you hear something ...anything. Okay? And you stay put. I need you to come back to me in one piece.\"\n \"I will, Mom,\" I say.\n When I hang up, the phone rings again. I hand it to Osnat, who\u0027s as anxious and scared as I am.\n \"Ze aba!\" she screams to the crowd after talking to the person on the other end of the line. \"Hakol beseder!\"\n Avi picks me up and twirls me around. \"They\u0027re okay!\"\n I can\u0027t believe it. I go into Sofia\u0027s room and tell her the good news. I learn from Doda Yucky that Uncle Chime and Ron had stayed at the bombing site to help the forty-plus wounded.\n There\u0027s a lot of hugging and rejoicing even though we\u0027re all full of sorrow for the poor souls whose lives were lost today in the bombings. It\u0027s a strange thing to be happy and sad at the same time. I don\u0027t know how Israelis deal with it all the time.\n Avi waits at the front entrance to the moshav with me, along with Mutt. The little guy is lying next to me, almost as if he\u0027s my protector.\n \"I can\u0027t believe what happened. This has been such a nightmare,\" I say. \"I almost lost my father. Before I really even knew him.\" It\u0027s too scary to think about.\n Avi says thoughtfully, \"But you get a second chance.\"\n I lean against him. \"Yeah, I do. And from now on I\u0027m going to make every second count.\"\n \"Me too,\" he says, and gives me one of his amazing kisses to prove it.\n When the gate opens and I see headlights from a car, I stand up. The car stops and my daddy, whose shirt has blood splattered on it, hops out and pulls me into his arms.\n \"Are you okay?\" I\u0027m staring at his stained shirt.\n \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m fine.\"\n \"Aba,\" I say to him in Hebrew. \"I love you so much.\"\n \"Oh, Amy, I love you, too.\"\n I pull back and wipe my tears with the back of my hand. \"I\u0027m so sorry I didn\u0027t say it before. I know I\u0027ve been treating you badly. I want you to be a big part of my life now. I want to be Jewish, too. And I want to learn Hebrew. Can you teach me?\"\n \"Slow down, I cant catch up with you. I\u0027m still basking in the \u0027I love you, Aba part.\" I see his eyes getting red and watery. \"I never want you thinking I didn\u0027t fight to be with you, sweetheart. I screwed up real bad in so many ways.\"\n He wipes a tear streaming down his face and I\u0027m dumbfounded.\n \"I was hoping this trip to Israel would change everything. I don\u0027t want to lose you to Marc. You\u0027re my daughter, not his,\" he says as he embraces me.\n He\u0027s crying like a baby. So am I.\n \"I thought I lost you,\" I say as we walk back to the house, letting Uncle Chime drive back all by himself.\n Avi has left us alone, too, giving me and my dad privacy.\n \"I lost you a long time ago, daughter. I\u0027m glad we\u0027ve finally found each other.\"\n \"Do you think you could find room in your apartment for me?\"\n \"You mean it? I\u0027d love for you to move in with me. For a year. For weekends. Forever. I\u0027ll take whatever you want to give.\"\n \"If you\u0027re not too busy with the Director of Homeland Security, that is.\"\n He chuckles and puts his arm around my shoulder. \"I always have room in my house for my number one girl and don\u0027t you ever forget it.\"\n \"You sure you don\u0027t have a girlfriend?\" I ask.\n \"Not anyone important enough to bring home to my daughter.\"\n \"I think you need someone ... to take the edge off of you.\"\n \"And who should I thank for taking my daughter\u0027s edge away? Or maybe I don\u0027t want to know.\"\n \"He\u0027s been a perfect gentleman.\"\n \"Who? Doo-Doo?\"\n \"Can you see me with a guy named after feces?\"\n \"His real name is David.\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"Doo-Doo is a nickname for David.\"\n Stupid nickname if you ask me. \"It\u0027s Avi.\"\n Ron\u0027s face is serious now. \"He\u0027s eighteen years old, Amy. And he lost his brudder ...\"\n \"I know all that. We\u0027ve helped each other during our trip and I... I love him.\"\n My dad\u0027s jaw tightens and the muscle in the side of it starts to twitch.\n \"It\u0027s not like that. He respects me and I respect him. Maybe too much.\"\n \"I have to get used to having a teenage daughter,\" he says.\n I look at him straight in the eye. \"No. You have to get used to me.\"\n CHAPTER 30\n You don\u0027t even know what you want until it\u0027s put in your lap.\n Well, it\u0027s the day before I have to leave for Chicago. Avi and I are going on an double date with Osnat and O\u0027dead.\n I glance at my cousin, who looks great now that I\u0027ve shown her how to put on makeup so she doesn\u0027t look like a dartboard.\n She\u0027s watching me pick out clothes to wear. I can tell by the way she\u0027s staring longingly at my Ralph Lauren sundress that she likes it.\n \"I don\u0027t like this dress,\" I say. \"You want it?\"\n Her eyes light up. \"Really?\"\n \"Absolutely. It makes my butt look big,\" I say, and toss it to her.\n I end up wearing a short, slinky, navy skirt and white top with frilly sleeves. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve dressed this nice since I\u0027ve been in Israel. I hope Avi likes it--all he\u0027s seen me in is jeans and shorts.\n When I hear Avi\u0027s voice in the hallway, my whole body is filled with anticipation and I can\u0027t stand it.\n Mitch is really going to be pissed when he realizes I\u0027ve fallen for another guy, but it would be impossible to ignore the excitement I feel when I even think about Avi.\n Just as I\u0027m about to walk out the bedroom door, my aba walks in the room. He sits on my bed and does a double-take. \"You\u0027re beautiful,\" he says. \"Like your mother. It scares me.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-24.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: \n How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) \n Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. \n Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close.
