{"id":85601,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"Amy, this is my brudder, Chaim.\" My uncle holds out his hand and shakes mine. He\u0027s a tall guy with a definite resemblance to Ron. They both have that same strong, muscular build. The guy is smiling, but I can tell there\u0027s tension behind that facade. Anger, too, although I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s directed at me or SD (short for Sperm Donor, I\u0027m too hot and sweaty to think of him as anything other than SD). \"Call me Dodor Uncle Chaim,\" he says. As if I could even say that name. He pronounces the C-h like he\u0027s about to hack a loogie. I swear I can\u0027t do those back throat noises for the life of me without making a complete ass of myself. I\u0027ll just call him Uncle Chime and leave off the gurgling back-throat noise. The lady beside Uncle Chime steps forward. I\u0027m shocked when she pulls me to her and hugs me tightly. My first instinct is to push her away, but her embrace is so warm and loving. I find myself leaning into her arms. She releases me after a long time, puts her hands on my shoulders, and holds me at arm\u0027s length. \"Beautiful girl,\" she says with a deep Israeli accent. She has these earrings with bells on them and no makeup on her face. My mom wouldn\u0027t be caught dead outside the house without makeup. Or earrings with bells dangling from them. The truth is, this woman is pretty without makeup and the bells just make her look angelic instead of stupid. She lets go of me and says with a smile, \"I\u0027m your aunt Yikara. Just call me Doda Yucky, okay?\" \"Ookaay,\" I say in a singsong voice to alert SD I\u0027m not comfortable calling this lady Yucky. \"Doda is \u0027aunt\u0027 in Hebrew,\" SD explains as if that was the part of this whole exchange that needed explanation. She just asked me to call her yucky! There are two more people standing there. One is a small boy, probably around three years old, with blond curls spiraling out of his head like Medusa\u0027s snakes. He\u0027s wearing nothing but a pair of Power Ranger underpants. \"Shalom, ani Matan,\" he says in a cute little voice. I have no clue what he\u0027s saying, but he\u0027s so adorable and his curls bounce on his head as he speaks. I step toward him and shake his little hand affectionately. The last one, a dirty blonde-haired teenager who is a bit taller than me, just stands there with her arms crossed over her chest. She\u0027s wearing the tightest jeans I\u0027ve ever seen on a human being and a crop shirt showing most of her flat stomach. I don\u0027t need a sixth sense to know she\u0027s royally pissed-off. \"This is your cousin, O\u0027snot.\" This time my laugh just comes out without warning. Although when I come to my senses and realize nobody else is laughing, I stop pretty quick. Okay, now O\u0027snot is not just pissed-off, she\u0027s got my famous, one-of-a-kind sneer down pat as if she\u0027d invented it herself. I don\u0027t hold out my hand in greeting because I\u0027m pretty sure my snotty cousin will ignore it. So I just say, \"Hi.\" \"Hi,\" she says through gritted teeth. Nice. \"Let\u0027s go inside so you can meet your Safia,\" Uncle Chime says. I\u0027m getting a little piece of satisfaction when I notice Ron\u0027s armpits are wet through his shirt. My armpit wet spots are the size of grapefruits, but Ron\u0027s are the size of small watermelons. He\u0027s more nervous than I am for me to meet my grandmother. Ha! CHAPTER 6 You can run from some problems, but then you get caught up in others. I enter the house slowly and peer inside. A kitchen is right in front of me. I follow Ron to the left and find a woman sitting on a rocking chair next to a window. She has white hair massively peppered with dark strands. She looks at me with bright blue eyes that almost glow. Our gazes meet and I feel like I\u0027m looking in the mirror at my own eyes. I\u0027m so overwhelmed it almost chokes me. Is the air getting thicker? I start breathing heavier, trying to get air into my constricting lungs. My Grandma. My sick Grandma. She looks small and weak. Is she dying? Turning to the rest of the family, I realize they\u0027re all staring at me. It makes me feel like I\u0027m being judged on some reality show they\u0027re watching. An over-excited television announcer\u0027s voice in my head says, Will Amy make a mistake and screw up this first meeting? Watch next week\u0027s episode of Illegitimate Children and find out if her sick grandmother accepts or rejects her in front of thirty million viewers... Before I even realize it, I turn and run out of the house before anyone can see the tears welling in my eyes. I run and run and run until my legs want to give out. I\u0027m passing rows of houses, haystacks, horses, cows, and sheep as if I\u0027m on some kind of farm set in Hollywood. When I stop running and start walking, I think Sofia must think I\u0027m some stupid idiot. I meant to hug her, I really did. But not in front the rest of the family. I feel like they\u0027re analyzing my every move. I keep walking, pissed at SD for making my first meeting with Sofia a spectacle. A small wire fence is in front of me, and as I attempt to step over it, a voice stops me. \"You can\u0027t go there.\" I freeze and turn to the harsh voice. It\u0027s no-shirt guy standing in front of a pile of hay about three stories tall. A sheen of sweat on his chest sparkles in the sunshine, but I\u0027m trying not to pay attention to it. Instead, I think about something gross. Like how he must smell like sheep and sweat and how he\u0027s in desperate need of a shower. But, for that matter, so am I. I wipe the tears falling down my cheek with my fingertips. \"Isn\u0027t this a free country?\" I say with attitude. The last thing I need is for some hard-ass teenager to think I\u0027m weak. He turns around and flings a whole bale of hay into the sheep pens. \"The sign says a minefield is behind the fence. If you want to take your chances, I won\u0027t stop you,\" no-shirt-cute-jerk says as he enters the sheep enclosure. At this point I\u0027m still straddling the fence. Damn. This IS a war zone. I eye my foot on the other side of the wire, feeling lucky it\u0027s still there and not blown off. I slowly lift it and bring it back to the side of the wire without minefields. \"You don\u0027t know where you are, do you?\" he asks gruffly as he gets another bale of hay. \"Sure I do,\" I say. \"I\u0027m on top of a mountain in the middle of Israel.\" Duh. \"Actually, you\u0027re in the northern part of Israel, not in the middle. In the Golan Heights.\" \"So?\" \"Americans,\" he mumbles, then slowly shakes his head in disgust. \"Okay, what\u0027s so special about the Golan Heights?\" \"Let\u0027s just say Syria is about ten miles that way,\" he says, pointing. \"For a Jewish girl, you don\u0027t know much about the Jewish homeland.\" Yeah, but I\u0027m not Jewish. I don\u0027t tell him this, he\u0027ll probably go off on me about it. I\u0027m glad when he turns away and walks back into the sheep enclosure. \"Arg!\" I jump at the sound at my feet. A mangy, dirt-encrusted puppy, who I think at one time was white, is furiously wagging his tail at me. Once we make eye contact, he rolls onto his back and puts his paws in the air. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say to the mutt. \"I\u0027m not a dog person.\" Go find some other sucker to rub their hands on that filthy, flea-ridden tummy of yours. I\u0027m not a cat person, either. In fact, I\u0027m not an animal person at all. And being surrounded by a farmload of the things is making me itch. I start to walk away. Unfortunately, the mutt follows. \"Arg!\" the thing says again. I keep walking. \"Don\u0027t you know dogs say \u0027ruff,\u0027 not \u0027arg\u0027?\" I ask it. \"What are you trying to be, a pirate?\" The dog answers with another, \"Arg!\" this time screechier than the last as if he\u0027s trying to annoy me on purpose. Hey, the way my day has been going, I wouldn\u0027t doubt it. \"Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!\" You\u0027d think the mutt was joking with me, wouldn\u0027t you? But as I turn to the rough, deep barking sound I realize pretty quickly the mutt has friends. A lot of them. In the first place, I was wrong about it being dirt-encrusted. These five dogs are caked in mud and definitely dirtier than the mutt-puppy. Also (in the first place) they\u0027re very, very big. And they\u0027re running right toward me barking up a storm as if I\u0027d kidnapped their child. Panic isn\u0027t the word to describe how I feel right now. As my life flashes before my eyes, I briefly weigh my two options. I could either head toward the wire and run into the minefields or jump into the sheep pens. I don\u0027t have time to waste so I just run as fast as my sweaty, tired, sorry legs can carry me. As I move, I\u0027m not even conscious about which option I\u0027ve chosen. I run faster and faster, barely aware of the high-pitched \"arg\" sound at my feet and the hefty \"ruffs\" not far behind. Just a little farther, I say to my clouded mind. I think I\u0027m screaming and yelling obscenities, but I can\u0027t be sure because I\u0027m too busy worrying about what my legs are doing and can\u0027t be bothered with censoring my mouth, too. It seems like a long time, but when I reach the enclosure my pace doesn\u0027t falter. Mr. Haraldson, my gym teacher, would be proud of my leap. I was nowhere near getting the presidential award in physical fitness last year, but I\u0027m probably making a world-record jump right now. I don\u0027t really aim where I\u0027m going; it\u0027s all just a blur. And when I land, I close my eyes. I hope I don\u0027t squash a sheep during my crash landing. But instead of colliding with a sheep, something hard and solid breaks my fall. I\u0027m afraid to open my eyes, so I can\u0027t see, but my sense of smell is heightened. I know this because the scent of boy sweat surrounds me. It\u0027s not grody body odor, just this musky guy aroma that makes me inhale deeper. Okay, now I realize what I\u0027m doing, where I am, and who I\u0027m smelling--like he\u0027s a damn rose petal--but it\u0027s really just a boy. I open my eyes wide. Don\u0027t ask me how I came to be straddling no-shirt-cute-jerk. His hands are on me. To be specific, one of them is on the small of my back and the other one is on my hip. And I get caught staring into mocha eyes that could definitely put someone in a trance. I\u0027m about to push away from him, but I hear the sound of someone walking along the grass beside the sheep\u0027s pen. I look over at who it is. I\u0027m acutely aware the position I\u0027m currently in looks really promiscuous and will probably get me in a ton of trouble. When I finally lean away from him, it opens my view to whoever has witnessed my debacle. I realize it\u0027s the last person I wanted to see. O\u0027snot. And when I see her lips in a tight line and her hands accusingly on her hips I come to the only conclusion one can muster. No-shirt-cute-jerk is my cousin O\u0027snot\u0027s boyfriend. O\u0027shit. CHAPTER 7 I\u0027ll never get used to being humiliated . \"I swear, Ron, it\u0027s not my fault.\" \"Those words come off your lips pretty often, Amy,\" he says to me. \"Now explain again why you ran away before you even met Sofia and then, within a matter of fifteen minutes, end up on top of a boy. In the middle of a pile of hay, no less.\" I dig some dirt out of my fingernail while the Sperm Donor has this very serious talk. \"Actually, to be technical, I fell on him,\" I say. I finger a piece of my hair that\u0027s been caked with mud. \"I really don\u0027t recall exactly how I ended up straddling him.\" We\u0027re sitting on the front lawn of my grandmother/ uncle/aunt/cousin\u0027s house. Ron does that thing with his hand through his hair again. And then unending silence. Should I explain what happened? I\u0027m not afraid to admit I want to be in control of my life.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-5.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close. Think goats, not Gucci. Going to Israel with her estranged Israeli father is the last thing Amy wants to do this summer. She’s got a serious grudge against her dad, a.k.a. “Sperm Donor,” for showing up so rarely in her life. Now he’s dragging her to a war zone to meet a family she’s never known, where she’ll probably be drafted into the army. At the very least, she’ll be stuck in a house with no AC and only one bathroom for seven people all summer—no best friend, no boyfriend, no shopping, no cell phone… Goodbye pride—hello Israel.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.jpg","author":"Simone Elkeles","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:24 PM"}}
