{"id":85613,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\"My boobs are too big for this thing,\" I say irritably. \"It doesn\u0027t fit.\" He steers the kayak to the side of the river and holds on to a branch to stop us from moving forward. \"Lean toward me,\" Avi says. I expect him to make some comment about my cleavage which now, thanks to the life jacket, resembles butt cheeks. But he doesn\u0027t. Instead, he leans forward and takes the straps, loosens them to make them longer, and fastens them. When I realize we\u0027re not moving and are still against the bank of the river, I look up. Avi is still close to me, his face inches from mine. Suddenly I start to feel something in the pit of my stomach. Like I\u0027m going to be sick, but not. He\u0027s watching me intensely and his nearness is making me dizzy. Then he leans closer and closer. \"What are you doing?\" I ask. He touches his fingers lightly to my cheek and all I can think about is the softness of his fingertips on my skin. \"I\u0027m going to kiss you,\" he explains. At first, I\u0027m dumbfounded. \"I have a boyfriend,\" I blurt out softly. \"I know,\" he says as he rubs my lip gently with his thumb. \"And ...and you\u0027re a jerk most of the time.\" His lips are so close I can feel the heat of them. \"Amy?\" \"Yeah,\" I say nervously. \"Stop talking so I can kiss you.\" Before I can answer with some smart-ass remark, his lips are on mine. And when I say it\u0027s nothing like I\u0027ve ever felt before, I mean it. I have to be detailed here so you get the whole picture. So one hand of his is on my face, cupping it gently as if it was porcelain and could break at the slightest touch. Then he slowly brushes his lips against mine, almost as if he\u0027s painting each part of my mouth with his. It\u0027s wonderful. It\u0027s intoxicating. And it\u0027s totally intense to the point that my mind is reeling out of control. Mitch never kissed me like he would treasure and memorize my lips forever. When he slowly pulls back and drops his fingers from my cheek, I say, \"Why did you do that?\" His mouth twists into a wry smile. \"Why did I kiss you or why did I stop kissing you?\" \"The first one.\" He settles on his seat in the kayak and leans back. I hear the birds chirping in the trees and the wind shaking the leaves. As if they\u0027re whispering about what just happened between me and Avi. I wonder what they\u0027re saying. \"You needed it,\" he finally says. Somewhere in all of this my sunglasses have fallen off and are resting on the bottom of the kayak. I snatch them up and push them back on the bridge of my nose before he can tell what I\u0027m truly feeling. \"Excuse me?\" I say. I needed to be kissed? What the hell kind of comment is that? He pushes the kayak away from the bank of the river, picks up an oar, and starts paddling. Then he hands me the other oar. What I really want to do is bang him over the head with the thing. Instead, I yank my oar from his grip and say dumbly, \"You kissed me.\" He shrugs and paddles some more, the muscles in his arms flexing each time he strokes against the small current. \"Just forget about it.\" As if I could. That wasn\u0027t just some little peck--that was like a slam dunk in the NBA playoffs. And it wasn\u0027t even a French kiss, but it was more intimate. I don\u0027t know exactly what I was feeling during it. My whole being, my whole spirit, was involved. Not just my lips. I know I\u0027m sounding like a geek, even to myself. And before you think it, it wasn\u0027t the four-letter word called love. \"Amy?\" he says. \"What?\" I think he\u0027s going to apologize and tell me our kiss was a soul-searching experience and it\u0027s changed his life forever. \"Hold on.\" \"As in \u0027wait, I have something to tell you\u0027?\" I ask. \"As in \u0027hold on to the kayak, we\u0027re reaching the rapids.\u0027\" CHAPTER 23 If you start a fight, I\u0027ll finish it. If I tell you my life just flashed before my eyes, I\u0027d be telling you the truth. Even Avi\u0027s kiss seems like a million years ago as I turn around and see the running waves, the bubbling water, and the white, foamy top to the rapids. \"I don\u0027t want to die!\" I screech. \"You\u0027re not going to die,\" he says loudly above the sound of the massive rush of water. \"Just stay on that side of the kayak so we don\u0027t tip over.\" \"I can\u0027t swim,\" I admit to him. \"You have a life jacket on. Just relax. If we tip you\u0027ll be safe.\" \"I\u0027m scared.\" And all I want to do is have him hold me so I feel safe. I close my eyes tightly as I hold a deathgrip on the sides of the kayak. \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027d never let anything happen to you. Just talk to me and it\u0027ll be over before you know it.\" \"What do you want me to talk about?\" I say. Does he want me to tell him where I want to be buried or who I\u0027d like to say my eulogy after we DIE in this river? I think he might not be able to hear me because I know he\u0027s working hard by the way the kayak is maneuvering around the rapids. \"Tell me about your mom.\" Not the best start to a conversation at this moment. I guess it\u0027s better than talking about my burial. \"She\u0027s going to marry her boyfriend.\" \"You don\u0027t like the guy?\" \"Not really,\" I say emphatically. \"So move in with your aba. \" I open my eyes. \"My aba?\" \"You know ...Ron. Aba \u0027vs. father in Hebrew.\" \"I know that. But I\u0027m for sure not moving in with him.\" \"Doesn\u0027t he live in Chicago?\" \"Yeah.\" \"So what\u0027s the problem?\" \"The problem is that he\u0027s not my father. Biologically speaking, maybe. We have a lot to work out between us before he can be considered a real father.\" \"If you say so,\" he says matter-of-factly. I\u0027m suddenly aware we\u0027ve passed the rapids and are now slowly gliding down the river. \"Don\u0027t tell me Moses survived going down this river in a basket as a newborn,\" I say. He throws his head back and gives a hardy laugh, the first I\u0027ve seen or heard from him. \"That would be the Nile River, Amy.\" \"Yeah, well I\u0027ll stick to bathtubs. They\u0027re much less dangerous.\" We ride the rest of the way in silence and I rest my head on the rim of the kayak. I hope some sun rays will give me a golden tan and not burn my skin to a crisp. Believe it or not, I\u0027m trying not to think about that comment Avi said to me after our kiss. But, in fact, I\u0027m obsessing about it. You needed it. Yeah, that\u0027s what he said. Can you believe it? Maybe he needed it. Either way, it\u0027s not going to happen again. What would I say to Mitch? Maybe I shouldn\u0027t even tell him I kissed another guy. It\u0027s not like he\u0027s going to find out on his own or anything. And it didn\u0027t mean anything; it was just an innocent one-timer. If food falling on the floor gets a five-second rule, shouldn\u0027t an innocent kiss get a one-timer rule? Of course it should, although I guess there is this itsy-bitsy-teensy-weensy part of my brain that\u0027s nagging me it wasn\u0027t an innocent kiss. And I\u0027m definitely ignoring the fact that there\u0027s this itsy-bitsy-teensy-weensy little part of me that wants to try it again. But not because I need it, that\u0027s for damn sure. I sit up. Just as I\u0027m about to ask Avi what he meant by his comment about the kiss, we catch up to the other two kayaks. \"What took you guys so long?\" Snotty asks. I instantaneously blush when everyone focuses on us. My eyes dart from Avi to the rest of the gang guiltily. A sly smile crosses O\u0027dead\u0027s face and he raises his eyebrows a few times. Instead of admitting we kissed and thinking of ways to divert the attention of the others, I take my paddle (which up until now I haven\u0027t used) and whack it on the water to splash Snotty and O\u0027dead. Direct hit! My cousin and O\u0027dead are shocked, their clothes are soaked, and I feel triumphant. Ha! That\u0027ll teach them to butt into my business. Snotty and O\u0027dead try paddling closer to us and I frantically paddle away from them. Looking over at my kayak partner, I notice his paddle is not even in the water. \"Help me!\" I scream while laughing. \"This is your fight, not mine,\" he says. To answer him, I stick my paddle in the water and whack it in his direction. Avi is now dripping with Jordan River water. I stick my tongue out at him, then say, \"Now it is your fight.\" Oh, I know what\u0027s coming next. I\u0027m not stupid enough to think I\u0027m going to stay dry for long. When Avi\u0027s paddle goes into the water and out of the corner of my eye I see O\u0027dead and Snotty\u0027s kayak come closer, I just keep whacking my paddle on the river like a madwoman. Water from all sides is coming at me. Ofra and Doo-Doo must be joining the chaos. Not that I could actually see anything, because my eyes are shut tight. For all I know I could be whacking water all over myself along with everyone else. Suddenly, it\u0027s quiet except for my paddle hitting the water. So I stop and open my eyes. Of course when I do, I realize it\u0027s the oldest trick in the book. Because as soon as I open my eyes, water splashes on me with a vengeance by everyone else. \"Truce!\" I scream, especially when I realize how much water has entered the bottom of our kayak. \"We\u0027re going to sink!\" The splashing stops and I realize we\u0027re all laughing together. And it makes me feel like I\u0027m really part of their little club of friends. By the time Avi and I reach the landing spot, our kayak is miraculously still floating. And waiting for us is a soldier with a machine gun slung over his shoulder. At first, I\u0027m startled. Then I realize who the soldier is ...it\u0027s Moron, Avis friend from the moshav. And the bandana I gave him with the peace sign is wrapped around the butt of his gun. Wow. My gift did mean something to him. \"Hi, Moron,\" I say when I get out of the kayak. He smiles at me. \"Hey, Amy.\" I wish I could take a picture of him smiling like that in his uniform and gun with a peace sign on it. He looks so ...nice and harmless, not like someone who would actually shoot that gun at people. I could see the caption now in some national magazine: Moron, Israeli soldier. The way the media likes to twist things around, the caption would probably get read like this: Moron Israeli soldier. Like he\u0027s a complete idiot instead of realizing it\u0027s the guy\u0027s name. Moron walks up to me and says, \"I\u0027ll be your military escort for the rest of your trip.\" Military escort? Why do we need a military escort? \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\" \"No.\" I don\u0027t want anyone to laugh at me so I don\u0027t ask the other questions running through my head. Listen, I\u0027m just starting to feel comfortable with these people and I don\u0027t want to make myself an outcast again. We take a minibus and drive for hours and hours. The landscape of this beautiful land is breathtaking ...one minute we\u0027re driving through grassy mountains resembling the rolling hills in The Sound of Music and the next we\u0027re in the middle of a large, populated city. If that weren\u0027t enough contrast, in another hour we\u0027re smack dab in the middle of a desert without a tree or house in sight. Out the window I see Bedouin Arabs herding their goats in the desert. It\u0027s as if I\u0027m looking at hundreds of years in the past through a piece of glass. A half hour later I see military tanks trekking on the desert floor, shooting. \"What are they doing with those tanks?\" I ask nervously.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-18.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close. Think goats, not Gucci. Going to Israel with her estranged Israeli father is the last thing Amy wants to do this summer. She’s got a serious grudge against her dad, a.k.a. “Sperm Donor,” for showing up so rarely in her life. Now he’s dragging her to a war zone to meet a family she’s never known, where she’ll probably be drafted into the army. At the very least, she’ll be stuck in a house with no AC and only one bathroom for seven people all summer—no best friend, no boyfriend, no shopping, no cell phone… Goodbye pride—hello Israel.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.jpg","author":"Simone Elkeles","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:24 PM"}}
