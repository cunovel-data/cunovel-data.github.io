I feel his warm breath on the back of my head as he leans closer to me. I resist the urge to lean back into him and close my eyes. \"Kissed?\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t want to think about other things he\u0027s done with girls so I say, \"Yeah. Kissed.\"\\n\\n \"Including my mother?\"\\n\\n \"No, smart-ass, not your mom. You know what I mean. A real kiss.\"\\n\\n \"A guy isn\u0027t supposed to talk about how many girls he\u0027s kissed. I\u0027ll tell you what. If you\u0027ll tell me, I\u0027ll tell you.\"\\n\\n I give him a look as if I\u0027ll kill him if he doesn\u0027t spill the beans. \"You first.\"\\n\\n \"I guess about eight,\" he finally admits.\\n\\n \"Eight!\" I say, flabbergasted.\\n\\n \"Why?\" he asks, and I can sense the alarm in his voice. \"How many have you kissed? I bet it\u0027s a lot more by the way you kissed me in the kayak.\"\\n\\n I smile at his compliment but say, \"Less than you.\"\\n\\n Try two, although the first one probably shouldn\u0027t count because that was during a camp overnighter and it happened accidentally in the dark.\\n\\n You might wonder how I accidentally kissed someone. Well, I thought I was kissing this guy I liked during a \"lights out mashing session\" and it turned out to be the one guy who\u0027d kissed about half the girls in the whole camp. I still remember the taste of soap in my mouth from trying to wash his germs out. You know what they say ...it\u0027s like you\u0027ve kissed whoever they\u0027ve kissed. Blech!\\n\\n Unfortunately when the lights came on during the \"lights out mashing session\" and I was lip-locked with Guy Wrong, Guy Right saw us and then ended up liking Jessica instead of me.\\n\\n \"Seven?\"\\n\\n \"No, not seven, you ho,\" I say.\\n\\n \"You know what, don\u0027t tell me. I don\u0027t want you to think about other guys you\u0027ve kissed. And I\u0027m not what you call a ho. Besides, I just want you to concentrate your thoughts on me ... on us.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you hated me.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to push you away because I couldn\u0027t stop watching you.\" His voice is hoarse and full of emotion. \"Sometimes I can\u0027t fall asleep at night. I get hot tinking about you,\" he says, his accent deeper than usual.\\n\\n \"You tink about me at night?\" I ask and by mistake say tink instead of think. \"Why?\" Please don\u0027t say my boobs.\\n\\n \"First of all,\" he says as he fingers the curls at the end of my hair that have started to frizz in the desert heat, \"you\u0027re beautiful. But the way you handle yourself in every situation with your own style mesmerizes me. You\u0027re animated, you\u0027re honest to a fault, you\u0027ve got this feisty personality I just can\u0027t help but watch because I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re going to say or do next. You\u0027re very exciting. And to top it off, you have a big heart even though you don\u0027t open it up often.\"\\n\\n I twist around to face him. \"I\u0027ve never had anyone describe me like that.\"\\n\\n \"When you tried to push me off the haystack back at the moshav, it totally shocked me.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, except it didn\u0027t work. You\u0027re like one big mass of muscle.\"\\n\\n He laughs. \"Don\u0027t feed my ego. Now tell me what attracts you to me. Besides my big mass of muscle.\"\\n\\n \"Ha, ha. But seriously,\" I say, then take my finger and slowly draw a path from the corner of his eye, past the stubble on his chin and end up at his full lips. \"Besides you being a gorgeous male specimen, I like the way you were always there for me when I did freak out. Even though you made it sound like a chore, you\u0027ve helped me with every challenge I\u0027ve had here. You let me fall on you when Mutt\u0027s friends were about to attack me,\" I say and kiss him gently on the mouth.\\n\\n \"You helped me herd the sheep,\" I continue, kissing him again, \"and you were my hero by washing off the snake-guts.\"\\n\\n Before I can kiss him again and continue telling him all of the incredible things I now see in him that I was blind to before, he crushes his lips to mine.\\n\\n \"Amy,\" he says against my lips. \"I think we\u0027re about to get ourselves in trouble. How old are you again?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be seventeen soon,\" I say breathlessly.\\n\\n He says something in Hebrew I obviously can\u0027t understand. \"We shouldn\u0027t be doing this.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not doing anything except kissing.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but--\"\\n\\n \"We can kiss, can\u0027t we?\" I say as I graze my lips down his neck.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he says in a strained, low voice, \"we can kiss.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t want him to think about my age right now. I want him to enjoy the time and the kissing. Especially the kissing. I press my open lips to his, because I can\u0027t imagine right now not touching my lips to his. He deepens the kiss and I follow, only barely aware we\u0027ve changed positions and are now lying down side by side.\\n\\n Okay, I\u0027ve never in my sixteen (almost seventeen) years felt like this before. It\u0027s as if I\u0027ve crossed the bridge from being a girl to a woman just by experiencing the strange, unfamiliar, steamy sensations deep in my body. My bodily reactions have intensified tenfold as my knight with an Israeli accent caresses my back. I feel like I\u0027ll die if we stop and I sense he feels the same.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to remember tonight when I\u0027m in basic training,\" he says as he nips my earlobe. \"When they try and wear me out, I\u0027ll recall this moment and get through it.\"\\n\\n My body feels like it\u0027s enduring sweet torture and I want to learn everything about Avi and his body right now. I grab his head to bring it closer to me and then I caress his body with my fingertips. Our lips and mouths are exploring each other\u0027s and our hands are doing the same.\\n\\n When I touch his back, his muscles tense beneath my fingers. My hand moves around to the front of his shirt and I pull the material up to feel his smooth skin and hard six-pack against my hand. His heart is beating fast; I can feel it pumping in an erratic rhythm.\\n\\n Moving my hand lower, I reach the waistband of his jeans and glide my index finger inside the band. Slowly, my fingers move downward.\\n\\n Avi groans softly and gently takes my hand and guides it away.\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t...\" he says.\\n\\n \"Why not?\" I ask breathlessly, still reeling from our intense kisses. I feel drunk (although I\u0027ve never been drunk, I can sure guess how it feels) and out of control.\\n\\n \"Besides the fact your aba would kill me?\"\\n\\n Great, my dad\u0027s not even here and still he\u0027s able to ruin my life.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care about what Ron thinks.\"\\n\\n \"You may not,\" he says as he sits up. \"But I do. I don\u0027t want either of us to regret anything tomorrow.\"\\n\\n I sit up, too. \"I won\u0027t regret anything.\" Ever.\\n\\n He kisses me on the top of my forehead. \"Let me take you to your room. It\u0027s getting late.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 25\\n\\n Approach me at your own risk.\\n\\n \"Boker tov,\" Avi says good morning to me in the breakfast buffet line the next morning. He leans forward to kiss me, but I pull away.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asks.\\n\\n Duh! He totally rejected me last night.\\n\\n \"Nothing.\"\\n\\n I continue to place whatever is in front of me on my plate. I barely realize it\u0027s this creamy stuff with whole pieces of little sardiny-like fishes inside (with the silver scales attached, thank you very much). It is DEFINITELY not like sushi. It\u0027s gross, but now that I\u0027ve put it on my plate, I\u0027m going to have to stare at it while I eat.\\n\\n Before I can add more to my plate, Avi grabs the dish out of my hand and puts it on the nearest table.\\n\\n I put my hands on my hips. \"Hey! That\u0027s my breakfast.\"\\n\\n I realize I\u0027m making a scene. I don\u0027t care.\\n\\n He grabs my hand and leads me toward the exit. \"It\u0027ll wait. We need to talk.\"\\n\\n He leads me into the lobby and out the front doors. A blast of steamy, hot desert air smacks me in the face.\\n\\n \"Okay, talk. Before I melt, please.\"\\n\\n He rubs his eyes in frustration. Next thing you know he\u0027ll be running his fingers through his hair.\\n\\n He looks straight at me and says, \"You think last night I stopped things from getting out of hand because I didn\u0027t want to be more intimate with you?\"\\n\\n \"Bingo,\" I say sarcastically. \"But I\u0027m wiser this morning and won\u0027t throw myself on you anymore. Besides, it\u0027s not like we were going to have sex or anything.\"\\n\\n \"Where you and I go physically, our emotions are starting to follow. I can\u0027t deal with that.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right. God forbid we should be emotional people. We should just call ourselves \u0027friends with benefits.\u0027 Or, better yet, why don\u0027t we just call this whole thing off so you can find another girl to be non-emotional with,\" I say as I head back inside before my armpits get damp through the shirt I\u0027m wearing. In hindsight, I\u0027m glad I decided to borrow Snotty\u0027s tank top.\\n\\n \"You are so stubborn,\" he says.\\n\\n I turn around and face him before I reach the door. \"I am not.\"\\n\\n \"Amy, you\u0027re the most stubborn person I\u0027ve ever met. You play games in your mind and create drama that isn\u0027t there just to piss everyone off, including yourself.\"\\n\\n I just stare incredulously at him.\\n\\n He takes my hands in his. \"Look at me.\" When I don\u0027t he says again, \"Look at me.\"\\n\\n I raise my eyes and look into his, which are wide and sincere.\\n\\n \"I wanted more last night,\" he says. \"Don\u0027t lie to yourself and think I didn\u0027t. I beat myself up about a million times after I left you. Believe me, I want you to throw yourself at me. But this thing between us is more serious than we\u0027re admitting to each other. You\u0027re leaving in a couple of weeks whether I want you to or not. And I\u0027m going into the army for three years.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t argue his points, so I just stand there staring into his brown eyes.\\n\\n He lets go of my hands and says, \"You want to call it off right now, just say the word.\"\\n\\n Then he just stalks back into the hotel and leaves me here in the hot desert heat, sweaty armpits and all.\\n\\n Damn. Why does Avi have to be so logical about everything? I hate being logical. But I\u0027m too hot to have an attitude and realistically Avi is right. We\u0027re getting too attached already.\\n\\n Slowly I walk back into the hotel and enter the restaurant. Avi is sitting down at a table, talking to his friends. There\u0027s an empty seat next to him with my plate on the table in front of it.\\n\\n I know for a fact I don\u0027t want to end it with him right now. I want to keep this thing going for as long as possible.\\n\\n Our eyes meet and he gives me a short smile. The problem is everyone else is looking at me, too. Okay, I guess I deserve it for causing a scene. I want to cringe in embarrassment, but I hold my head high and sit down next to him.\\n\\n I avert my eyes from everyone around us, including Avi. But when he reaches for my hand under the table and gives it a squeeze, I squeeze back. I can handle this relationship I tell myself. Even with its ups and downs.\\n\\n \"Have you ever been to an alpaca farm?\" Ofra asks me.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s an alpaca?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"It looks kind of like a llama,\" Avi answers.\\n\\n \"Cool.\"\\n\\n Ofra pats me on the back. \"We\u0027re going right after breakfast so make sure you\u0027re ready.\"\\n\\n By ten in the morning, we\u0027re parked at the entrance to the alpaca farm. Then we pay for bags of food to feed the tall, furry animals with long necks. I expect the alpacas to be in cages, but they\u0027re all running around. We actually walk into the large enclosure with them.\\n\\n I regard the alpacas warily. They\u0027re all shades of brown, red, black, and tan. And their bottom teeth are so huge they look like alpaca hillbillies. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-20.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) \\n Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. \\n Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close.
