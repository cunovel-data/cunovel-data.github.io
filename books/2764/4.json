{"id":85600,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"Let\u0027s set the record straight, Ron. I\u0027m an ail-American girl with red, white, and blue blood running through these veins. I do not stay at places called moshavs. Unless I\u0027ve signed up for the Girl Scouts, which I didn\u0027t. I need amenities. Amenities! Do you know what those are?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. But don\u0027t expect many where we\u0027re going. Last time I visited, only one family on the moshav had electricity and it wasn\u0027t mine.\"\\n\\n I open the glove compartment.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" Ron asks.\\n\\n \"Looking for a map so I know which direction to go when I escape from the moshav\" I say.\\n\\n He chuckles.\\n\\n \"Ha, ha, funny, funny. I bet you won\u0027t be laughing when you wake up one morning and find I\u0027ve gone back to civilization.\"\\n\\n Ron pats my knee with his hand. \"I was just kidding, Amy. They have electricity.\"\\n\\n Kidding? Ron was kidding with me?\\n\\n \"I knew you were joking. Do you actually think I\u0027m that gullible?\"\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t answer, but I know he knows the truth by the quirky way his mouth is moving.\\n\\n \"Will you at least give me the keys to your car so I can drive myself to a mall?\"\\n\\n \"Sorry. Driving age here is eighteen.\"\\n\\n \"What!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take you wherever you want to go. Don\u0027t worry. Besides, if you get lost you won\u0027t know how to get back.\"\\n\\n Good, I think to myself. Getting lost sounds like a great idea.\\n\\n I sigh and look out the window. On one side of the car is the Mediterranean Sea and on the other side are mountains with houses built into them. If I was in a better mood\\n\\n I might even think the scenery is beautiful, but I\u0027m cranky and tired and my butt is numb.\\n\\n I start doing my butt exercises. I was watching a late night talk show a couple of years ago when some action star, maybe Steven Seagal or Antonio Banderas, was talking about how they do butt exercises while in the car.\\n\\n Just tighten, then release. Tighten. Release. Tighten. Release. I\u0027m \"feeling it burn,\" but after ten minutes my butt cheeks start to quiver on the tighten part and I stop.\\n\\n By now we\u0027ve taken a turn away from the sea and all around us are small trees in rows.\\n\\n \"What are those?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Olive trees.\"\\n\\n \"I hate olives.\"\\n\\n \"I love them.\"\\n\\n Figures. \"I hope you\u0027re not one of those pit-spitters.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"You know, those people who spit out the pit right in front of other people at the table. That\u0027s totally gross.\"\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t answer. I would bet my grandmother\u0027s underpants Ron is a pit-spitter.\\n\\n \"What kind of food do you like?\" he asks. \"I\u0027m sure I can get it for you.\"\\n\\n \"Sushi.\"\\n\\n \"You mean raw fish?\" he asks, wincing.\\n\\n \"Yep.\"\\n\\n I used to hate it. When Mom first had me try it I gagged and spit it out (into my napkin, very discreetly I might add, unlike gross pit-spitters). Mom loves sushi. I guess it\u0027s like alcohol. You want to puke the first time you have it, but then it grows on you and you like it. It\u0027s probably why they say there\u0027s a thin line between love and hate. Now I don\u0027t just like sushi, I crave it. Ron obviously needs to be introduced to sushi with a professional sushi-eater like me.\\n\\n We\u0027re now driving through the mountains on an extremely curvy road and I\u0027m getting nauseous. The last time I noticed civilization was about fifteen minutes ago.\\n\\n We wind our way down one mountain and stop at the road leading to another one. I read a sign with the words MOSHAV MENORA in English and some words in Hebrew on it.\\n\\n Ron takes the road to Moshav Menora. Now the place looks like Switzerland, with grassy hills surrounding us on all sides.\\n\\n He stops at a scenic rest stop built into the mountain.\\n\\n \"This is it?\" I ask.\\n\\n He turns to me and takes the key out of the ignition. \"This is the Golan Heights, a very special and beautiful place. Let\u0027s go see the view.\"\\n\\n \"Do I have to?\" I ask. \"I got to pee.\"\\n\\n \"Can you hold it for a few minutes longer? I really need to talk with you before you meet my family.\"\\n\\n This I have to hear. I open the car door and walk outside. We stroll in silence to the edge of the mountain. When I look over the edge, it reminds me of a scene from a postcard.\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t know about you,\" Ron blurts out.\\n\\n Huh?\\n\\n \"Who doesn\u0027t know about me?\"\\n\\n \"My mudder, my brudder and his wife ...\"\\n\\n A pang of pain stabs my chest as if something pierced it. My heart starts beating fast and I\u0027m breathing heavily. \"Why?\" I whisper, barely able to get the words out.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s complicated,\" he says, and then looks away from me. \"You see, when I came to America I wanted to prove to everyone back here I could make it. You know, The\\n\\n American Dream.\"\\n\\n \"And you didn\u0027t expect me to come along and ruin your dream,\" I say.\\n\\n \"I met your mom the first weekend I was in the U.S. I was a cocky Israeli who just wanted to have a good time. A few months later I found out I was going to be a fadder.\"\\n\\n I start walking away from him. What does he want me to do, apologize for being born?\\n\\n \"I hate you,\" I say as I head back to the car. I wipe the stupid tears I can\u0027t help from falling down my cheeks.\\n\\n \"Amy, please. For once let me set the record straight--\"\\n\\n \"Just unlock the door.\" I hear the click and get inside the car. He\u0027s looking at me like he wants to explain more, but I don\u0027t want to hear it. \"Let\u0027s go already!\" I yell.\\n\\n He gets back in the car and we ride up to the top of the mountain. I thought I was ready to meet Ron\u0027s family, but now all I want to do is crawl into a hole.\\n\\n Because he\u0027s not just going to introduce me to his family, he\u0027s going to tell them for the first time he has an illegitimate daughter.\\n\\n Chapter 5\\n\\n If I close my eyes, will life stop spinning out of control?\\n\\n We reach a gate and a guy with a large machine gun comes up to our car. I\u0027ve never even seen a machine gun before today and cringe every time I think about what they\u0027re used for.\\n\\n Ron says something in Hebrew. The guy smiles and signals for the gate to open. We drive down a dirt road on top of the mountain and pass six rows of houses. There are about seven to ten houses down each road on either side. Ron turns down one of them and parks in front of a house.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going in until you tell them who I am,\" I say.\\n\\n I think he\u0027s going to argue and I ready myself for a fight. But Ron just says, \"Fair enough.\"\\n\\n He gets out of the car and I stay put. I watch as he enters the small one-story house.\\n\\n The windows are open in the car, but there\u0027s no breeze. And it\u0027s not only hot, I think the devil himself must live on this mountain because sweat is pouring down my face, neck, and chest. My Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch shirt has wet marks on it already from disgusting armpit sweat.\\n\\n How can these people stand the heat? I look at my nail before biting on it. What is Ron saying to them? Is he sweating as much as I am? I hope so.\\n\\n I step out of the car and lean against the side of it, listening for the scolding Safta should be giving Ron. Boy is he going to get it. If I were Safta I\u0027d rip him a new one for denying her, well, me. But I don\u0027t hear yelling. In fact, I don\u0027t hear much coming from the house.\\n\\n Instead, something hits my arm. Hard.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" I yell and panic.\\n\\n I\u0027m not stupid, I know it\u0027s not a bullet. Not that I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if Ron\u0027s family decided \"do away\" with his illegitimate daughter once they heard the truth.\\n\\n As I have that thought, I look down and see the offending object.\\n\\n A soccer ball.\\n\\n \" Tizreki le\u0027kan\" a voice bellows from behind the car. As if I can understand. But I can\u0027t, so I ignore it. Besides, I already feel a bruise forming on my arm.\\n\\n The sound of running footsteps echoes before I\u0027m face to face with an Israeli boy about my age.\\n\\n \"Shalom\" he says.\\n\\n He\u0027s wearing jeans, has a dusty and ripped white T-shirt on, and is wearing Greek sandals. You know, the ones like the Greek philosophers wore. But that\u0027s not the worst part. The guy is wearing white socks along with the sandals. Socks with sandals! Seeing that makes me laugh so I look up at his face instead of his feet. I don\u0027t want to insult the guy.\\n\\n \"Hi,\" I say.\\n\\n Does he speak English? I don\u0027t know so I just stand there in silence.\\n\\n Two more boys run up to us. One starts to talk to the boy in Hebrew but becomes silent when he notices me.\\n\\n \"I America,\" I say slowly and loud like I\u0027m talking to a chimpanzee. I\u0027m hoping by some miracle they\u0027ll understand me.\\n\\n They turn to each other with confused looks on their faces and I realize these next three months are going to be like living in a bubble. A bubble with people who don\u0027t understand a word I\u0027m saying, except for the Sperm Donor. Could my summer vacation be ruined more?\\n\\n The first boy steps closer to me. He has dark blond hair and a rugged, boyish grin. I know, I know, rugged and boyish don\u0027t really go together. But on this guy it does, trust me. \"You speak English?\" he asks with a heavy accent.\\n\\n Huh? \"Yes. Do you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. But what does \u0027I America\u0027 mean?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing. Just forget it.\"\\n\\n \"You a friend us not?\" he asks.\\n\\n Huh? Obviously his English isn\u0027t good. Was he asking if I\u0027m a friend or not? I\u0027m almost afraid to say no. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n The second guy turns to me. \"What\u0027s your name?\"\\n\\n \"Amy.\"\\n\\n \"Hi Amy, I\u0027m Doo-Doo,\" he says. Then he points to the other two guys. \"And this is Moron and O\u0027dead.\"\\n\\n Now, I\u0027ve never said these four words in a row before. In fact, I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve ever come out of someone less than the age of sixty, but they come out of my mouth almost automatically.\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon?\" I say. My eyes are squinting as if that would clear my ears so I could hear right.\\n\\n They all look at me like I\u0027m the one who\u0027s got the problem. I have this urge to burst out laughing. But I suppress it because they obviously don\u0027t get the joke. Which actually makes it all the more funny. Okay, so some parts of my trip are actually going to be amusing.\\n\\n But my amusement fades as another guy comes up to us. He\u0027s got dark brown hair that matches his eyes. And he\u0027s tall, bronzed, and wearing no shirt. He has jeans hugging those slender hips of his, a washboard stomach, and by every measure he\u0027s just about the toughest looking teenager I\u0027ve ever seen.\\n\\n \"Americayit,\" Moron says, pointing to me.\\n\\n No-shirt guy says some stuff to Doo-Doo, Moron, and O\u0027dead in Hebrew and ignores me completely. Which just proves one of my many theories ...the gorgeous guys are always the biggest jerks. At least the other guys smiled and introduced themselves. No-shirt guy just barks some words at his friends, then walks away.\\n\\n \"How long are you visiting for?\" Moron asks, eyeing the suitcases in the back seat.\\n\\n For a helluva lot longer than I want to. \"The whole summer.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to hang out at the beach tomorrow tonight. Do you want to join us?\"\\n\\n Doo-Doo asks.\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I say.\\n\\n I look over at the house and there\u0027s a crowd of four strangers plus Ron standing in the open doorway. They\u0027re all staring at me. How could I have forgotten why I was here in the first place?\\n\\n Ron walks up to me. I want to ask, \"How did it go?\" but don\u0027t.\\n\\n So now I find myself walking up this muddy pathway, to this small house that\u0027s going to be my residence for the next three months. As the cherry on top of the cake called my life, I\u0027m going to live with family members who I\u0027ve never met before and a biological father who I hardly know. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-4.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) \\n Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. \\n Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close. Think goats, not Gucci. \\n Going to Israel with her estranged Israeli father is the last thing Amy wants to do this summer. She’s got a serious grudge against her dad, a.k.a. “Sperm Donor,” for showing up so rarely in her life. Now he’s dragging her to a war zone to meet a family she’s never known, where she’ll probably be drafted into the army. At the very least, she’ll be stuck in a house with no AC and only one bathroom for seven people all summer—no best friend, no boyfriend, no shopping, no cell phone… \\n Goodbye pride—hello Israel.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.jpg","author":"Simone Elkeles","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:24 PM"}}
