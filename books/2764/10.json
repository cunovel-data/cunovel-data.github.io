I must look like a clown.\\n\\n \"Your father wanted me to tell you everyone\u0027s at my house eating what you call lunch. If you want to join them, follow me.\"\\n\\n I step beside him as he\u0027s walking, but then I stop. \"Why didn\u0027t he tell me himself?\"\\n\\n Avi shoots me a withering glance. \"He also wanted me to apologize for watching you undress the first night you were here.\"\\n\\n \"Well?\"\\n\\n \"Israelis don\u0027t apologize for what they\u0027re not sorry for.\"\\n\\n Now I\u0027m really getting riled up. \"You\u0027re not going to apologize?\"\\n\\n He looks at me straight in the eye. \"What I saw was beautiful and natural, so why should I say sorry?\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 12\\n\\n Boys are either jerks or clueless. Take your pick.\\n\\n \"Ron, I need to call home and my cell phone won\u0027t work.\" I\u0027ve been in Israel almost six weeks and need to call home once again. First of all, Mitch is back from his camping trip and I need to talk to him. Second of all, I need to call Mom and Jessica.\\n\\n Ron is sitting on the couch watching some news channel in Hebrew. Uncle Chime is with him, along with the corkscrew-haired Matan.\\n\\n Matan is naked and he\u0027s been like that for the better part of my trip so far. Who am I to bring it up to them that their son isn\u0027t dressed and his pee-wee is dangling out for all the moshav to see. You\u0027d think they would have noticed they\u0027re not living in a nudist colony.\\n\\n \"I think your mom was going out of town,\" Ron says, his face still turned toward the television.\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ll call a friend.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the number,\" he says as he heads toward the phone in the kitchen.\\n\\n Obviously, like everywhere else around here, there\u0027s no privacy.\\n\\n I recite Mitch\u0027s number and then he hands me the phone. I pull up a chair in front of the refrigerator and park myself there for the call.\\n\\n \"Hello,\" a scratchy voice answers.\\n\\n \"Mitch?\" I say.\\n\\n \"Yeah?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Amy.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"You know, your girlfriend,\" I say, starting to get pissed.\\n\\n \"Hey, babe. Sorry I haven\u0027t called, I got back late last night. Do you know what time it is?\" he says, his voice still ragged.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in Israel, Mitch. And no, I don\u0027t know what time it is in Chicago because I\u0027m halfway across the globe.\"\\n\\n \"Wait, you lost me. Israel?\"\\n\\n \"Are you sleeping or listening to me? \u0027Cause I can only make one call here and I\u0027ve chosen to call you. It\u0027s like jail.\"\\n\\n I hear him yawn and I can tell he\u0027s attempting to sit up instead of lie in bed. Hopefully now he\u0027ll pay some attention to what I\u0027m saying.\\n\\n \"Mitch?\"\\n\\n \"Wait, I gotta pee.\"\\n\\n I have an urge to bang my head against the wall.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t it wait?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m trying to disguise my annoyance in front of the rest of the family.\\n\\n \"Well, can you hurry it up a bit? This is long distance, you know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m tryin\u0027, babe.\"\\n\\n In the background I hear a stream of pee hitting water and Mitch lets out a long, satisfying sigh. I don\u0027t know if I should feel flattered he feels comfortable enough to pee while he\u0027s on the phone with me, or grossed out.\\n\\n \"You done?\" I ask after I hear a loud flush.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he says. \"I\u0027m back in my room.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t wash your hands.\"\\n\\n I mean, if I heard him pee and flush I would have definitely heard the sound of him washing his hands.\\n\\n \"You just told me to hurry up. If I wash my hands I have to put the phone down. You wanna wait?\"\\n\\n \"I guess not. Just remember to wash them when you get off with me,\" I say. \"And then disinfect the phone with antibacterial spray.\"\\n\\n \"Leave it to you, Amy, to tell it like it is.\"\\n\\n Unfortunately, Snotty opens the front door and walks in the house with Ofra. Avi, Doo-Doo, and Moron follow them into the house. Great. Just my luck. Now I have a bigger audience to eavesdrop on my conversation with my boyfriend.\\n\\n Out of the corner of my eye I catch Avi looking at me, his jaw tense. I haven\u0027t talked to him since he purposely didn\u0027t apologize for watching me undress. I think we\u0027ve been avoiding each other, actually. Which is just fine with me.\\n\\n I turn my chair around so I\u0027m facing the wall and say quietly into the phone, \"You know what I like about you?\"\\n\\n \"Shit,\" Mitch says, \"I just stubbed my toe on my skateboard.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s not the response I was aiming for.\\n\\n \"You okay?\" I ask, trying not to lose my patience.\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027m bleeding. Wait a minute.\"\\n\\n As I wonder how much a phone call costs per minute from Israel to the United States, I twirl the cord around my finger.\\n\\n It\u0027s hard while I\u0027m waiting not to turn around to catch a glimpse of what the others are doing. They\u0027re talking loudly in Hebrew.\\n\\n I can\u0027t stand it anymore. I take a glimpse at Avi. He\u0027s wearing a black T-shirt with some Hebrew lettering on it and faded jeans ripped in both knees. He\u0027s also wearing a silver-linked chain around his wrist.\\n\\n Now, I\u0027ve seen boys wear jewelry before and haven\u0027t thought it enhances masculinity in the least. But Avi wears the bracelet like it\u0027s a manly accessory. He makes the other guys look dorky for not having a silver link chain bracelet on their wrists.\\n\\n When my gaze travels up, I feel like a Peeping Tom when I realize he\u0027s caught me checking him out. Lifting the bracelet hand, he gives me a mock salute.\\n\\n I can feel my face turn red and my blood starts to pound loudly in my head. He\u0027s seen me check him out. I want to die now, especially when he then walks up to Snotty and grabs her hand. That hand holding Snotty\u0027s is the same one that held my snake-guts-covered foot two weeks ago.\\n\\n \"Okay, I\u0027m back,\" Mitch says. \"No blood, but it still hurts like a bitch.\"\\n\\n I forgot I was even on hold and, to be honest, wasn\u0027t paying attention to what Mitch just said. Turning back around, I giggle softly into the phone. Avi is trying to concentrate on Snotty, but I know for a fact he\u0027s listening to my end of the conversation.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s so funny?\" Mitch asks. \"I\u0027m hurting here and all you can do is laugh?\"\\n\\n Have you ever tried to make other people think you\u0027re having a good time when you\u0027re not? What sucks is when the person you\u0027re with doesn\u0027t get it. They need to play along, but you can\u0027t tell them for fear of being discovered. Play along with me, Mitch.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t wait to go camping with you,\" I say.\\n\\n Let Snotty and all of them realize I have someone back home waiting for me. For some reason I\u0027ll feel like less of a loser here for hanging out by myself every day.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" he says. \"You hate camping.\"\\n\\n \"Of course I do,\" I say, then giggle again.\\n\\n Giggling doesn\u0027t come naturally to me, but I do a pretty good job of making it sound authentic. I think.\\n\\n Although my boyfriend now thinks I\u0027m a freakoid.\\n\\n \"What about our tickets to the BoDeans concert at Ravinia for next weekend?\" he says. \"I spent fourteen bucks on those tickets, along with the extra thirty I spent on the Renaissance Faire tickets. You said you\u0027d go with me.\"\\n\\n Thankfully, the group heads outside. I let out a breath because I can finally be myself again.\\n\\n I turn back around in the chair and stare at a flying spider-like thingy near the ceiling.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well that was before I got sucked into going to a country infested with\\n\\n Ferragamo-stealing mutts and flying spiders.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"Forget it. I wish I could be there with you, really I do.\"\\n\\n God, I hope he doesn\u0027t ask Roxanne Jeffries to go out with him. She\u0027s his next-door neighbor and has been flirting with him all year. He even told me she undresses with the curtains wide open.\\n\\n \"Say, I\u0027ve got an awesome idea. Take Jessica. She\u0027s not doing anything this summer except working at a day camp for kids. She\u0027ll go with you.\" And she\u0027ll keep an eye on you for me.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think it\u0027d be weird if I go out with your best friend?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not like it\u0027d be romantic or anything.\"\\n\\n Jessica doesn\u0027t even think Mitch is cute. She\u0027s told me he reminds her of a poodle on Prozac. Everyone\u0027s entitled to an opinion. Mom always says, \"Opinions are like assholes, everybody\u0027s got one and everyone thinks everyone else\u0027s stinks.\" It\u0027s true.\\n\\n \"I guess I could call her,\" he finally says.\\n\\n \"Tell her I miss her.\"\\n\\n \"Sure. When are you coming back?\"\\n\\n If I can manipulate Ron, very soon. \"Before school starts, but who knows.\" We both go to Chicago Academy, a private high school.\\n\\n He yawns. \"Have fun.\"\\n\\n As if. \"You, too. Don\u0027t miss me too much.\"\\n\\n He gives a short laugh before saying, \"Bye, Amy.\"\\n\\n I think I hear the phone click before I answer, \"Bye.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 13\\n\\n A star is just a star. Or is it?\\n\\n It\u0027s nine o\u0027clock the next morning and I\u0027m bored, as usual. I eat breakfast, alone again, as I watch Sofia sit in her chair. Snotty came home late last night, her friends all laughing and making noise at two o\u0027clock in the morning. I hate to admit it, but I\u0027m sorry I stayed home. With the exception of Snotty and Avi, hanging with the group is kind of fun.\\n\\n \"Your aba wants you to go to the sheeps. He\u0027s waiting for you,\" Sofia says.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to.\"\\n\\n I know I sound like a little kid, but why go into detail and hurt the ol\u0027 woman.\\n\\n \"He misses you.\"\\n\\n What? He wouldn\u0027t miss me even if I disappeared from this earth.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" I say as I stuff hummus into a pita and take a bite.\\n\\n \"He loves his homeland and wants to share it with you.\"\\n\\n I have a mouth full of hummus as I blurt out, \"Why doesn\u0027t he move back here if he loves it so much?\"\\n\\n \"I bet you know the answer to that question, Amy. He stays away because of you. You\u0027re his family. His future. His blood. Wherever you are is his home now.\"\\n\\n I kneel beside her while I listen to her voice. It\u0027s soothing, and when she talks it almost sounds like a lullaby. I\u0027m loud. My mom is loud. I talk loud. I walk loud. I\u0027m just a loud person. But this old lady is like cotton, everything about her is soft and quiet. She leans over and takes something out of her pocket.\\n\\n \"Hold out your hand,\" she says.\\n\\n I hold my hand out. She drops something into it and gently closes my fingers over my palm.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Look at it.\"\\n\\n I open my fist and look at a small gold and diamond Jewish star glittering in the center of my palm. It\u0027s attached to a thin gold necklace. The star is smaller than a nickel, just big enough to know what it is, but small enough to be almost...private.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what to say to her. Being Jewish isn\u0027t a part of me. Mom doesn\u0027t believe in religion so I\u0027ve never been to church except for my cousin\u0027s wedding. I\u0027ve never been to a synagogue, either, except for Jessica\u0027s bat mitzvah.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like you to have it,\" Safta says. \"It\u0027s called the Magen David, the star of David.\"\\n\\n Man, I want it. I don\u0027t know why I want it, but I do. I\u0027m not Jewish and would feel like a huge faker if I did take it. I mean, I could never wear it or anything. It\u0027s just so shiny and glittery and it actually means something important to Safta.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t take this,\" I say. When I note the disappointment in the eyes that are an exact replica of mine I add, \"It\u0027s too beautiful.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-10.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) \\n Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. \\n Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close.

She’s got a serious grudge against her dad, a.k.a. “Sperm Donor,” for showing up so rarely in her life.
