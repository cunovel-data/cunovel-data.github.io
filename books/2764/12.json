{"id":85607,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"How dare he bring Mitch into this ...this ...this ...\"I bet he wouldn\u0027t even want to,\" I say back.\\n\\n For the rest of the afternoon, I copy the yell-stomp technique Avi showed me and I\u0027ve become quite the herder.\\n\\n At one point Ron even said, \"Good job, honey.\" He\u0027ll never know how much those words meant to me.\\n\\n Right after the adults leave the pens for the day, I watch as the teens gather together on bales of hay over ten feet tall.\\n\\n I walk past them until Ofra yells down at me. \"Amy, come up here.\"\\n\\n Snotty glares at her, but Ofra ignores her.\\n\\n \"No, thanks,\" I say.\\n\\n Avi is up there, sitting like he was born ten feet off the ground.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s scared to climb up here,\" he says. \"She\u0027s got big words, but little courage.\"\\n\\n Unbelievable. One minute he\u0027s trying to help me and the next he\u0027s being the biggest showoff and insulting me. It doesn\u0027t take more to get me climbing up the yellow, wiry straw\\n\\n When I get to the top, I don\u0027t know where to sit. I hang my feet over the edge of the hay and lean back. All eyes are on me. I turn to Avi and give him a little to stew about.\\n\\n \"Why do you hate me?\" I ask.\\n\\n I know this shouldn\u0027t be laundered in public like this, but I can\u0027t help it. I need to know, and I need to know now.\\n\\n Avi doesn\u0027t answer and everyone else is looking away from him.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t take it personally,\" Doo-Doo says. \"He\u0027s been like this for a while.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" I direct my question to Doo-Doo, but I\u0027m still looking at Avi.\\n\\n Nobody says anything. The tension is as hot as the sun beating down on my back.\\n\\n Avi barks out words in Hebrew I obviously can\u0027t possibly understand. My Hebrew vocabulary is limited to about five words. He knows this. Snotty knows this. Hell, they all know it.\\n\\n Which makes me feel like one of those flying spider-looking things back at the house. Not a spider, not a fly. Just somewhere in-between.\\n\\n They all start arguing. At once. Very loudly. It sounds like one big phlegm-fest because it seems as if every word in Hebrew has the \u0027ch\u0027 sound coming out of the middle of their throats.\\n\\n It\u0027d be nice to know what they\u0027re all talking about. Are they discussing why Avi hates me? It sure feels that way. But they\u0027re arguing.\\n\\n It\u0027s obvious Avi and Snotty hate me, I\u0027m so glad the other kids have been nice. O\u0027dead leans his body closer to Snotty\u0027s each time he talks. Interesting observation I\u0027ll reserve for later. I wonder what it is about her that attracts all the guys? Anyone can have black makeup running down their face.\\n\\n I stand, ready to climb down from this haystack. I feel so uncomfortable around Avi and Snotty\\n\\n \"You want to come on a camping trip with us?\" Doo-Doo asks.\\n\\n My eyebrows furrow. Before I can answer, Avi interrupts me.\\n\\n \"Mah-pee-tome!\" Avi says to Doo-Doo.\\n\\n \"Llama-low?\" Doo-Doo says back to his friend.\\n\\n \"Hello? Why don\u0027t you speak English?\" I finally say. \"Don\u0027t you realize it\u0027s rude to talk privately while I\u0027m right in front of you?\"\\n\\n Ofra leans back on her elbows and nods her head. \"She has a point.\"\\n\\n My eyes blink. I could almost kiss the girl on the lips for supporting me so much. Although I don\u0027t go that way. But if I did, I would.\\n\\n Avi groans.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t go camping,\" I say.\\n\\n \"You said you were going with your boyfriend. I heard you on the phone,\" Avi challenges.\\n\\n Think quick, Amy. He\u0027s got your number.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, I only go with him. Mitch has been a Boy Scout since he was, like, five years old or something.\"\\n\\n Snotty hisses. \"Amy, you make up stuff to try and look good. What\u0027s real with you and what\u0027s not? Avi\u0027s right about you.\"\\n\\n Silence. Until I feel my patience snap inside my body.\\n\\n I know I shouldn\u0027t start up with someone I have to share a room with. And I know it probably isn\u0027t the smartest thing to go off on my cousin in front of an audience. She probably won\u0027t understand what I\u0027m going to say anyway because of the language barrier. But I can\u0027t help it, there\u0027s like an overload of adrenaline running through my brain.\\n\\n Even as I tell myself to keep my mouth closed, I hear myself say, \"Do you get off on being a royal bitch? \u0027Cause ever since I met you, you\u0027ve treated me like a piece of shit.\" I\u0027m on a roll and my mouth is working overtime. \"I can\u0027t stand you, your short shirts, tight pants ... or your sorry excuse for breasts! How\u0027s that for being real?\"\\n\\n I wave my finger at Avi. \"And you, all you\u0027ve got to offer is a bad attitude and a chip on your shoulder. I will go camping, just to piss ...you ...off! You don\u0027t like it, don\u0027t go. Then you can be an Israeli with a big mouth and little courage.\"\\n\\n \"You think you got courage?\" Avi challenges me.\\n\\n \"Damn straight. I could push you off this thing without thinking twice.\"\\n\\n He stands up, his mouth upturned in a smirk. \"I dare you.\"\\n\\n Okay, I think about it. But only once. Then I push his chest with all the strength I have.\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t budge, the guy is like a rock.\\n\\n When I hear his laugh, I turn around and jump down the piles of hay until I reach the ground. Wouldn\u0027t you know it a feeling of rationality comes over me right now. And I think:\\n\\n I don\u0027t know why tears are rolling down my face.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know why I just blew up at two people I\u0027m going to have to see for the next month.\\n\\n And I sure as hell don\u0027t know why I agreed to go on a camping trip in the middle of a war zone with people who hate me.\\n\\n God, I\u0027m in Israel, the Holy Land. Where are you?\\n\\n CHAPTER 15\\n\\n When the pickins are slim, you take what you can get.\\n\\n That night after dinner, I\u0027m watching television with Doda Yucky when Snotty\u0027s friends come barging in the door. Why don\u0027t people lock their doors around here?\\n\\n Snotty and Ofra come out of the bedroom dressed in slinky, short, tight-fitting dresses. Avi, Doo-Doo, and O\u0027dead are wearing jeans with long-sleeve T-shirts.\\n\\n I don\u0027t ask where they\u0027re going tonight, because I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m perfectly happy to sit in front of the television all day. I\u0027ve been pleasantly surprised that there\u0027s a lot of American shows on TV in Israel. That\u0027s probably why Israelis know so much English.\\n\\n Ron, who has been talking on the phone most of the evening, comes over to me. \"The kids are going to a disco.\"\\n\\n A disco? Discos went out in, like, the seventies. \"Good for them,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you want to go?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"It might be fun to get off the moshav.\"\\n\\n If he only knew what I said to O\u0027snot earlier. I insulted her clothes and her boobs. I\u0027m not about to admit those little facts to Ron.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to ask them to take you,\" he says, and before I can stop him he stands up and walks over to Snotty. He says something in Hebrew to her.\\n\\n She says something back.\\n\\n At this point Doda Yucky interrupts her, her voice in a scolding tone. Then my aunt walks over to me and takes my hand. \"O\u0027snot wants to take you out with her friends.\"\\n\\n Yeah, right. But the lady just fought on my behalf, and I don\u0027t have the heart to argue with her. Instead, I shoot a scalding look at Ron, the person who got me into this mess in the first place.\\n\\n Ten minutes later I find myself in Avi\u0027s car, being driven down the mountain. Avi and Snotty ignore me, but I don\u0027t blame them. I hate them, they hate me. It\u0027s a mutual\\n\\n hate-hate relationship.\\n\\n When we pull up to the \"disco,\" I get out of the car and follow Snotty, Ofra, Doo-Doo, O\u0027dead, and Avi to the entrance. It looks like a large warehouse. Loud music is blaring from the place and colorful, blinking lights are shining through large windows.\\n\\n I halt as soon as I scan the long line of people waiting to get in. \"Is it safe?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"I promise there aren\u0027t any snakes inside for you to accidentally step on,\" Snotty says, then laughs at me.\\n\\n My eyes flash in outrage as I focus on Avi. How could he have told Snotty about the snake-guts mishap? What a betrayal. Now I feel humiliated because of him.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" Ofra says, locking my arm with hers as she leads me to the line.\\n\\n I toss my hair back and stand in line. When I reach the front, an army guard makes me open my purse and he checks the contents. I expect him to ask me for an ID, but he doesn\u0027t. I guess in Israel there are no age restrictions for dance clubs. When the army guy waves me on, I have to go through a metal detector in order to enter the \u0027disco.\u0027\\n\\n Boy, they\u0027re not taking any chances. If we had a soldier at the entrance to every town, shopping mall, and bar in the United States, we\u0027d be out of soldiers. There wouldn\u0027t be anyone left to protect our country.\\n\\n I walk in, and the floor is vibrating to the beat of the music because it\u0027s so loud. Snotty, Ofra, O\u0027dead, and Doo-Doo go directly to the dance floor and start dancing. Avi is leaning against a railing, brooding as usual. But he\u0027s surrounded by girls while he\u0027s standing there so he doesn\u0027t look like a loner.\\n\\n Me? Well, I\u0027m standing here alone because I don\u0027t feel like dancing right now. It\u0027s wall-to-wall people, but I manage to squeeze through the crowd, heading for the bar. I need a Coke, or at least something in my hand so I\u0027m not just standing around staring at people.\\n\\n Luckily, I snag the only open barstool before anyone else can get their butt on it.\\n\\n I take a moment to take it all in. The people at the disco are wearing very trendy outfits. They\u0027re also dancing, laughing, and drinking. The air smells like cigarette smoke; obviously there aren\u0027t smoking laws here.\\n\\n I don\u0027t go to clubs back home because I\u0027m only sixteen and they won\u0027t let me in until I\u0027m twenty-one. But when I do, I\u0027m going to have as much fun as these Israelis.\\n\\n The bartender says something to me in Hebrew and places a beer mug in front of me with yellow liquid inside.\\n\\n \"I speak English,\" I say at the top of my lungs so he can hear me above the music.\\n\\n He leans forward and says in my ear, \"The guy over there bought you the drink.\"\\n\\n He points to the other end of the bar, where a guy wearing a white button-down shirt with most of the buttons undone is sitting. Is he kidding? The guy looks as if he\u0027s about Avi\u0027s age, and has long hair. And it\u0027s not cool long hair, it looks like it\u0027s been greased back with too much hair gel. He\u0027s probably the one uncool guy in the whole place.\\n\\n Great. I\u0027m an uncool guy magnet.\\n\\n To my horror, the guy is walking over to me as if he\u0027s some macho dude. He\u0027s wearing a huge grin on his face, which looks like it hasn\u0027t been shaved in a week.\\n\\n I need help here.\\n\\n Snotty and the gang are on the dance floor so they won\u0027t be much help. I search the room for Avi, who\u0027s obviously moved away from the railing. If I find him, I could pretend he\u0027s my date so this guy will leave me alone.\\n\\n When my eyes finally settle on Avi, I realize he\u0027s not brooding anymore. He\u0027s dancing with some Hilary Duff look-alike.\\n\\n To make matters worse, he\u0027s a good dancer. Not one of those guys who only moves from side to side. No, Avi moves like he\u0027s been born to dance with a girl in his arms.\\n\\n I watch in disgust as he leans forward and says something into her ear, then they both laugh. For some reason I wish it wasn\u0027t so loud that he would have to be so close to her to talk. I don\u0027t care about him, I\u0027m just pissed that he\u0027s having a good time and I\u0027m not.\\n\\n \"Alio, ay zeh cusit\" Uncool Guy says once he\u0027s weaved his way through the crowd and is now standing in front of me.\\n\\n \"I speak English,\" I say, shrugging apologetically.\\n\\n \"My English not so good,\" he says. \"You American?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-12.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) \\n Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. \\n Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close. Think goats, not Gucci. \\n Going to Israel with her estranged Israeli father is the last thing Amy wants to do this summer. She’s got a serious grudge against her dad, a.k.a. “Sperm Donor,” for showing up so rarely in her life. Now he’s dragging her to a war zone to meet a family she’s never known, where she’ll probably be drafted into the army. At the very least, she’ll be stuck in a house with no AC and only one bathroom for seven people all summer—no best friend, no boyfriend, no shopping, no cell phone… \\n Goodbye pride—hello Israel.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.jpg","author":"Simone Elkeles","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:24 PM"}}
