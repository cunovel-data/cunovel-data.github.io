{"id":85614,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\"Target practice,\" Avi says. I hope their aim is accurate. In less than two months Avi will be a soldier, too, learning to shoot a gun. And he\u0027s less than two years older than me. It\u0027s the strangest thing. I\u0027m actually getting used to seeing soldiers all around and guns and tanks daily ... it boggles my mind how different life is here. We stop off at a little store to get Cokes (thank the mighty lord) and snacks. I watch through the store window as Avi goes out to the parking lot alone. I pay for my Kit Kat with the few shekels Snotty gave me and head after him. \"Okay, let\u0027s have it out,\" I say. He turns to me as if surprised I\u0027m cornering him. \"What do you mean?\" \"Duh! Why did you say back in the kayak you kissed me because I needed it? If that wasn\u0027t the biggest copout, I don\u0027t know what is.\" \"What\u0027s a copout?\" I roll my eyes. \"You know, taking the easy way out instead of admitting you liked kissing me. Admit it, Avi.\" \"I told your aba I would take care of you on this trip and nothing would happen to you.\" \"Yeah, well you can throw that promise out the window.\" \"I\u0027m sorry if I led you on, but it\u0027s not going to happen between us.\" I\u0027m tired of arguing. Instead, to prove my point I reach out and grab the back of his head and pull him toward me. Instantly, our lips touch and it\u0027s like I\u0027m in that kayak with him once again. I close my eyes and wrap both arms around his neck, glad when his arms go around my waist and he pulls me closer. I don\u0027t care who\u0027s watching, I wouldn\u0027t change this for the world. But suddenly he drops his hands from my waist and pulls away. Then I watch in horror as he swipes his mouth with the back of his hand, as if he wants to erase the kiss off his lips. \"I can\u0027t do this, Amy. Don\u0027t make it hard for me.\" Tears are welling in my eyes and I\u0027m not even trying to stop them or wipe them. \"Don\u0027t cry,\" he says, reaching out to wipe a tear streaming down my cheek. \"You\u0027re a great girl--\" \"Don\u0027t say that just to try and make me feel better. In fact, don\u0027t say anything to me. I get it, loud and clear.\" I start to walk away from him and head to the minibus. \"Amy, let me explain,\" he says, catching me on my arm. I stand there, waiting for words I\u0027m not sure I want to hear. I look up at his face and for the first time I see something I\u0027ve never seen before from him. Sorrow. It is so prevalent it makes me scared. He squeezes his eyes shut for a second, as if the words coming out of his mouth will cause him pain just by saying them. \"My brother Micha died last year in a bombing.\" He looks at me for my reaction, but I\u0027m too stunned to say anything. Instead, I hug Avi tight, wishing I could take some of the pain away from him even though I know in my heart I can\u0027t. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I whisper into his chest. We stay that way for a long time. When he pulls back, I notice his eyes are bloodshot. He covers them with the palms of his hands. \"I hate being emotional,\" he says. \"I\u0027m probably one of the most emotional people I know,\" I admit. He gives me one of his rare smiles, then his expression turns serious. \"I like you, Amy. Probably more than I want to admit, even to myself. But I don\u0027t want to get serious with anyone right now. I have a nephew without a father and a sister-in-law who just sits at home grieving her dead husband. I\u0027m going into the army next month. If something happens--\" \"If I promise not to grieve for you if you die, will that make you feel better?\" I say. He shakes his head. \"It\u0027s not funny, Amy. I\u0027m going to be trained as a commando.\" \"Listen, I\u0027m just talking about a summer fling, not some lifetime love affair.\" I\u0027m not even thinking about Mitch right now. And I have a feeling Mitch isn\u0027t thinking about me, either. Avi and I have a connection I can\u0027t ignore. \"You\u0027re too emotional not to get involved. You could never have a summer fling. Not the way it\u0027s been between us, at least.\" \"Then what about we end it when this little adventure trip is over. If you want to be a coward for the rest of your life, go ahead. But if you want to have a great time with a kickass girl, you\u0027re going to have to face your fears.\" I want to say please, please, please, but I don\u0027t. Listen, a girl\u0027s got to have a little dignity left if she\u0027s rejected by the guy she likes. \"Who\u0027s the kickass girl?\" he asks, pretending to look around for one. Playfully I punch him in the stomach. Nothing more is said about our non-relationship, but he kisses me and says, \"You ready for this?\" I wink at him and say playfully, \"Absolutely.\" When he grabs my hand and leads me toward the rest of the gang, I\u0027m not surprised their eyes are wide with shock. Listen, if I were in their shoes I\u0027d think the world spun on its axis a bit too fast to see me and Avi trying out an actual relationship. Even if it\u0027s only a non-committed, short fling. The only thing nagging me in the back of my head is . .. what are the sleeping arrangements going to be like tonight? Avi is eighteen, and way more experienced than me. Will he expect more than I\u0027m willing to give? CHAPTER 24 Doing the wrong thing sometimes feels so right. Moron drives us to a hotel. To be honest, I don\u0027t know how he found the place. It\u0027s in the middle of the desert with nothing else for miles around, or at least that\u0027s what it seems like. The whole ride to Beersheva, Avi and I were really close, almost as if an invisible wall has been lifted between us. I rest comfortably in his arms and even sleep on his lap during the ride. And you know what? He strokes my hair, as if he treasures it. It feels sooooo good, almost too good because I\u0027m getting these tingling sensations all over my body from just thinking about him kissing me again. But as we arrive at the hotel and head to the front desk in the lobby, I\u0027m getting a bit nervous. Sleeping next to O\u0027dead was safe and uneventful. To be fair, we never actually slept together because of my fake snoring. I look over at Avi. I know I couldn\u0027t pass the fake snoring past him; he knows when I\u0027m faking. Besides, I wouldn\u0027t even want to be fake with him. But I\u0027m nervous as to what he expects from me. I don\u0027t want to be one of those girls who gets in trouble with a guy and then says, \"Yes, I slept in the same bed with him, but I didn\u0027t expect it to get out of hand ...\" I\u0027m always thinking, You shouldn\u0027t have slept in the same bed with him in the first place, dummy. \"What are the sleeping arrangements?\" I ask Ofra. \"Who do you want to sleep with?\" she asks with a hint of sarcasm in her voice. Snotty dangles three keys in our faces and says, \"The girls are sleeping with the girls and the guys with the guys.\" I\u0027m relieved the guys and girls are going to be sleeping in separate rooms. Somehow I have the feeling things could get out of hand with me and Avi. Our relationship is so explosive in other ways I\u0027m sure it will be that way if we\u0027re alone together. We settle ourselves into our rooms, take a short siesta, and head to the restaurant in the hotel for dinner in the evening. After dinner, I make it my business to sit next to O\u0027dead as we all sit in the lobby of the hotel. \"O\u0027dead, will you help me with something?\" I ask. He shrugs. \"Sure.\" I give O\u0027snot a wink and lead him to my hotel room. It\u0027s the one I\u0027m sharing with Ofra and O\u0027snot. When we get in the room I motion to the bed and say, \"Sit down.\" He shuffles his feet uncomfortably. \"Amy, I\u0027m not interested in you like that.\" I lean against the wall. \"Is there someone you are interested in? Like O\u0027snot?\" His mouth goes wide. \"How did you know?\" I roll my eyes. \"It\u0027s obvious. And you need a little kick in the butt to make it happen between the two of you.\" A knock on the door interrupts us. When I open it, it\u0027s Avi. And he\u0027s not looking too happy. \"What\u0027s going on here?\" Avi asks. I put my arm around Avi and kiss him on the lips to calm him down. \"Are you jealous?\" He just stares into my eyes without saying anything. \"I\u0027m trying to fix up O\u0027dead and O\u0027snot,\" I explain. Avi\u0027s eyes dart from me to O\u0027dead, whose nod confirms what I just said. I say to O\u0027dead, \"O\u0027snot wants to know how you feel, so go to her and spill your guts.\" When his eyebrows are furrowed I realize my slang English has confused him. \"Go tell her how you feel. Now, before she finds some other guy.\" He leaves the room quicker than I\u0027ve ever seen him move before. Avi grins. \"What?\" I ask. \"You did a very nice thing, Amy. Totally selfless.\" I turn away from him. \"No I didn\u0027t. I was just getting sick and tired of watching him look at her like he\u0027d die if she didn\u0027t pay attention to him.\" God forbid I should be seen as soft. He comes up behind me and wraps his arms around my waist. \"You want to go for a walk?\" I nod. He holds my hand as we exit the hotel and aimlessly trek down a gravel path. I get a sweet fluttering feeling in my heart just by being close to Avi. \"Tell me more about your brother.\" Avi\u0027s pace slows and he takes a deep breath. \"I don\u0027t talk about him much.\" \"Why?\" He hesitates before saying, \"It hurts. Like deep inside here.\" He points to his heart. \"I know, it\u0027s not very cool.\" I squeeze his hand. \"No, it is cool. I mean, it shows you loved him. But you have to talk about it. If you don\u0027t, part of your brother\u0027s spirit dies along with him.\" He stops and thinks about this for a minute. Then he nods his head slowly. \"He loved playing soccer. He was way better than me, but he let me win most of the time to boost my ego.\" \"Sounds like a cool brother to me. You\u0027re lucky.\" \"Yeah.\" He shakes his head and sighs. \"I wish it was me who died instead.\" \"Is that why you\u0027re Mr. Angry all the time?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he says. \"I guess so.\" \"You can\u0027t change the past, Avi. Believe me, I\u0027ve tried. But it doesn\u0027t work.\" \"This conversation is deep.\" I laugh. \"You\u0027re right.\" \"Let\u0027s talk about something else. Like how much you like me.\" I want to say I am totally into you, but instead blurt out, \"Ofra says you\u0027ve dated a lot of girls. Is it true?\" This feeling in my heart scares me and maybe I want to push him away subconsciously. If I hear about his other girlfriends, it will be easier to protect myself because I\u0027ll distance myself emotionally from him. \"I\u0027ve dated,\" he answers. \"But not for a while. I was afraid in the kayak I\u0027d be a bad kisser, it\u0027s been so long.\" \"Your kissing was just fine,\" I say. More than fine. We start climbing a rocky hill next to the hotel. \"I want to know more about you,\" I say as he helps me reach a large rock that sits high on the hill. Avi sits down overlooking the dark desert on one side and lights twinkling like diamonds from a town in the distance on the other. It\u0027s a very romantic setting and I wonder if Avi\u0027s taken other girls here. He guides me down and I sit in front of him, between his outstretched legs. \"What do you want to know?\" he asks. A lot, to be honest. But I say the most common question a girl asks a guy, hating I can\u0027t come up with something original or something sounding more mature.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-19.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close. Think goats, not Gucci. Going to Israel with her estranged Israeli father is the last thing Amy wants to do this summer. She’s got a serious grudge against her dad, a.k.a. “Sperm Donor,” for showing up so rarely in her life. Now he’s dragging her to a war zone to meet a family she’s never known, where she’ll probably be drafted into the army. At the very least, she’ll be stuck in a house with no AC and only one bathroom for seven people all summer—no best friend, no boyfriend, no shopping, no cell phone… Goodbye pride—hello Israel.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.jpg","author":"Simone Elkeles","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:24 PM"}}
