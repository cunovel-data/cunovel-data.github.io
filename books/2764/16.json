{"id":85611,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"Really? It\u0027s that small?\"\\n\\n \"The whole state of Israel is like the size of New Jersey.\"\\n\\n \"No kidding?\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\"\\n\\n Man, the way it sounds I\u0027m starting to think American kids really do get the better end of the stick.\\n\\n Ofra and I walk back to the campfire, where the rest of the group is setting out sleeping bags.\\n\\n Now I panic.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t plan for sleeping bags. Where are the tents? When people go camping back home there\u0027s tents. Or cabins. Or teepees.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t bring a sleeping bag,\" I say quietly to Ofra.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s okay,\" she says. \"I\u0027m sure Avi will share with you.\\n\\n I blink, as if that would clear my hearing problem.\\n\\n \"Come on, Amy,\" Ofra says as she pushes my shoulder back. \"You know Avi likes you.\"\\n\\n Avi? Likes me? I don\u0027t think so.\\n\\n \"He hates me,\" I say.\\n\\n I look over at the guy, and he\u0027s sitting on his sleeping bag Indian style, a guitar resting on his leg. \"He called me a spoiled American bitch,\" I say to prove my point.\\n\\n \"Maybe he likes spoiled American bitches,\" she says before walking off to join Snotty, Doo-Doo, and O\u0027dead.\\n\\n \"Right,\" I mumble back, although I know she can\u0027t hear me.\\n\\n And for the first time since I came to Israel, I\u0027m truly confused to the point where I\u0027m getting this weird feeling inside my stomach every time I look at Avi.\\n\\n Yes, he\u0027s hot as all get out.\\n\\n Yes, he\u0027s about as masculine as a guy could get.\\n\\n Yes, he\u0027s helped me with the snake-guts and herding the sheep.\\n\\n But he\u0027s also arrogant, rude, and totally ignorant.\\n\\n Could a guy like that actually be attracted to me?\\n\\n On the other hand, could I actually be attracted to a guy like that?\\n\\n CHAPTER 20\\n\\n Faking it... It\u0027s another way of manipulating people into doing what we want.\\n\\n We\u0027re all sitting in front of the campfire, which is blazing now thanks to all three of the guys. And we\u0027re listening to Avi play his guitar. I have to admit, his voice is very soothing. Of course I don\u0027t have the foggiest idea what he\u0027s singing about because it\u0027s in Hebrew. Who knew the phlegm language could actually sound harmonious when put to music.\\n\\n He\u0027s not looking at me as he\u0027s singing. O\u0027dead and Snotty are singing along to the music, all very mellow now due to the mood of the night. Doo-Doo and Ofra are holding hands and are swaying to the sounds of the guitar.\\n\\n Snotty and O\u0027dead are sitting across from each other. He\u0027s staring at her googly-eyed while he\u0027s singing. She\u0027s oblivious.\\n\\n When the song is over, I say to Avi, \"That\u0027s a beautiful song. Did you write it?\"\\n\\n I can still hear the hum of the last note as Avi responds, \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s it about?\" I ask.\\n\\n His expression grows serious. \"A guy who loses an important person in his life.\"\\n\\n I automatically assume it\u0027s a girl and hate the wave of jealousy that comes over me. I don\u0027t respond. Silence fills the air. I think he hates me, but somehow I\u0027m getting this weird feeling there\u0027s some sort of pain behind his words.\\n\\n Thinking about what Ofra said, I can\u0027t help but wonder how I can figure out his true feelings for me. Not that I care what they are, but listen, an informed girl is a smart girl.\\n\\n All indications up until now tell me he resents my presence in Israel and he thinks I\u0027m spoiled (which I\u0027m not).\\n\\n Silence still hangs in the air. It\u0027s as if everyone is waiting for something to happen between me and Avi. Love or hate. Peace or war. I won\u0027t give them the satisfaction of knowing what I\u0027m feeling. Heck, I don\u0027t even know what I\u0027m feeling half the time or where my life is headed, thanks to my parents.\\n\\n I\u0027ve been trying to put out of my mind the fact that Mom wants to move to the suburbs. The next thing you know she\u0027ll be wanting babies with this guy. I may just be a sixteen-year-old kid, but I do know one thing: I am not, I repeat, I am NOT changing dirty diapers.\\n\\n Just the thought of moving makes my stomach weak. Maybe Jessica\u0027s parents will let me move into their condo for junior and senior year. I could even pay them from the money Ron puts in the bank for me. Normally I wouldn\u0027t touch that money, but pride hasn\u0027t been a word in my vocabulary since coming to Israel. Why should anything be different when I go home?\\n\\n While I\u0027ve been daydreaming, I notice the rest of the group has started getting into their sleeping bags.\\n\\n Only I don\u0027t have one. I scan the area. There\u0027s three guys and three girls now that Moron has left for his army service. I could sleep with Ofra, but she and Doo-Doo have found a spot off to the side and they\u0027ve zippered their sleeping bags together. I didn\u0027t even know they were a couple until tonight.\\n\\n Avi is putting his guitar back in its case. There\u0027s no way I\u0027m going to ask Snotty if I can sleep with her, she was the person who manipulated me into coming on this little \"survivor\" vacation in the first place.\\n\\n Avi knows I\u0027m just standing here watching everyone. This sucks, because I want to make him squirm. Oh, great. Now he\u0027s walking up to me. Instead of waiting for him, a light bulb goes off in my brain.\\n\\n Now I\u0027ve got a plan. Okay, it\u0027s not well thought out and it does require some manipulation, but I think it will have the desired consequence.\\n\\n I ignore Avi advancing on me and hurriedly crouch next to O\u0027dead.\\n\\n \"O\u0027dead,\" I say really sweetly. I imagine Avi watching my every move. His eyes are like lasers on the back of my head.\\n\\n O\u0027dead finally looks in my direction. \"Huh?\"\\n\\n Now I\u0027m doing this really big yawn with the arm stretch and everything. It looks authentic, I think. And it definitely gets everyone\u0027s attention, except Ofra and Doo-Doo. They\u0027re still making out and probably won\u0027t be coming up for air for a while.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m really tired and I forgot to bring a sleeping bag,\" I say, making sure you-know-who hears. \"Would you mind if I shared yours?\"\\n\\n O\u0027dead right now looks like a mouse cornered by a cat. By the way, I\u0027m the cat. Meow! O\u0027dead looks from me to Avi.\\n\\n I\u0027m so tempted to look behind me to see Avi\u0027s expression. I\u0027m also wondering what Snotty thinks; she seems to be oblivious to everything else around here.\\n\\n Before the poor guy can answer me, I say, \"Thanks,\" and go back to the car where there\u0027s some privacy to change into my PJs.\\n\\n I have a huge grin on my face and I don\u0027t even know why. I know Avi was going to offer his sleeping bag to me, like he\u0027s playing the hero or something. Then he could have more ammunition that I\u0027m a spoiled American bitch who\u0027s ruining his vacation. Screw that. I\u0027m going to stay away from him as much as possible on this trip.\\n\\n Starting with sleeping with O\u0027dead.\\n\\n Of course I\u0027m not actually going to sleep with O\u0027dead. Just sleep with him. Although as I think about how small the sleeping bag is, I\u0027m probably not going to get much sleep tonight.\\n\\n I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s getting so cold outside. It\u0027s so hot during the day I could fry an egg on a rock in seconds. But now, as I take my bra off underneath my T-shirt and hurriedly change into another shirt, I\u0027ve got goose bumps all over my body. Brr! I wish I\u0027d thought to bring sweats.\\n\\n I bind my hair in a high ponytail, brush my teeth with bottled water from the back of the truck, and trot quickly back to O\u0027dead\u0027s sleeping bag. I\u0027m rubbing my forearms with my hands to keep warm, but it\u0027s no use.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so cold,\" I say to nobody in particular.\\n\\n Avis the only one in his sleeping bag. The rest have gone off to who knows where.\\n\\n I unzip the bag and examine the interior.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" Avi asks.\\n\\n \"Checking for snakes,\" I say before making sure the bag is safe and start zippering it back up. \"You know, you should do the same. I wouldn\u0027t want you to get bit or anything.\"\\n\\n He sits up and regards me with those big, dark eyes. \"I bet you\u0027d like it if I got bit.\"\\n\\n \"No. What I\u0027d like is if you\u0027d leave me alone. You\u0027re eighteen. Don\u0027t you have to join the army or something?\" I say as I settle into O\u0027dead\u0027s sleeping bag.\\n\\n I suddenly realize as I try to lay down I\u0027m sans pillow. That means without. Avi throws his at me and it hits me in the face. I grimace, but take the soft thing as Avi turns around and lays down, his head resting on his bent arm. I should feel guilty about taking his pillow, but I don\u0027t.\\n\\n \"In two months,\" he murmurs.\\n\\n I sit up. \"What?\"\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t answer. Instead, he says, \"Lyla tov, Amy.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know much Hebrew, but I\u0027ve been in Israel long enough to know lyla tov means \"good night.\" He\u0027s trying to piss me off. I just know it.\\n\\n I unzip the sleeping bag and stand up. Then I walk over to Avi and crouch next to him. His eyes are closed. Faker.\\n\\n \"Helloooo?\"\\n\\n He opens one eye. \"What?\"\\n\\n I sigh loudly. \"A second ago, you said two months. What\u0027s in two months, besides me leaving this awful place that\u0027s as hot as hell in the day, but as frosty as the North Pole now.\"\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t move, just says with eyes closed as if he\u0027s talking in his sleep, \"I start basic training for the IDF in September.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the IDF?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Israeli Defense Forces.\"\\n\\n Basic training in the Israeli Defense Forces? I feel a little bit bad for Avi he has to go join the army whether he wants to or not.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say.\\n\\n This time he opens both eyes. \"For what? I\u0027m proud to be able to protect my people, my country. What do you do to protect yours?\"\\n\\n What a bitter, bitter dude.\\n\\n \"I do enough,\" I say. \"If Israel didn\u0027t piss off all its neighbors then maybe--\"\\n\\n He leans forward, his expression hard. \"Don\u0027t you dare judge my country. Until you\u0027ve walked in our shoes,\" he says, \"you have no clue what it\u0027s like to be Israeli.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m trying not to be nervous, but the way he\u0027s talking makes me shake a little.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, don\u0027t judge my country either,\" I say back.\\n\\n I start to get up. He grabs my wrist and pulls me back down.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the difference between us. I am my country. You\u0027re just a product of yours.\"\\n\\n Yanking my arm away I say, \"That\u0027s not the only difference, Avi. I\u0027m going to college and will be successful after high school. And you, you\u0027ll probably just be a dumb Israeli sheep farmer the rest of your life.\"\\n\\n Stomping back to O\u0027dead\u0027s sleeping bag, I feel better thinking about how now I really proved to him I am a bitch.\\n\\n I undo the sleeping bag once again to check for any fanged creatures who have decided to nest in the place I\u0027m going to sleep. Luckily, there are none so I zip the thing back up and shimmy inside.\\n\\n Looking back at Avi, I see his back is to me. Good.\\n\\n Unfortunately, just as I\u0027m getting comfortable O\u0027dead and the gang come back. I\u0027m trying to take up the least amount of space possible, but it\u0027s no use. This bag wasn\u0027t made for two people.\\n\\n O\u0027dead kneels down and climbs into the bag with me. I give him a small smile. I don\u0027t want him to think I\u0027m not grateful he\u0027s agreed to share his warm sleeping bag with me. But I definitely don\u0027t want him to think I\u0027m coming on to him either.\\n\\n He might suspect I\u0027m going to rip his clothes off or something. As if. I haven\u0027t even done more than kiss my own boyfriend. I\u0027m what you call a sexually slow girl. Because I know what they teach in sex ed is actually true. There are real-life consequences to having sex before marriage.\\n\\n Like AIDS.\\n\\n Like other sexually transmitted diseases that last a lifetime.\\n\\n Like an unwanted baby--like me!\\n\\n There\u0027s no way in hell I\u0027m going to risk bringing a baby into this world without being married to the man I love. Unlike both of my parents. I mean, what were they thinking? Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m glad to be alive. But the crap I\u0027ve had to go through my whole life, including this trip and my mom\u0027s brain fart by agreeing to marry Marc is ruining my life. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-16.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) \\n Moshav?

I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. \\n Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close.
