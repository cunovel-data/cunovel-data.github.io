{"id":85597,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"CHAPTER 1\\n\\n In a matter of seconds parents can change the course of your life.\\n\\n How does a relatively smart sixteen-year-old girl get stuck in a sucky situation she can\u0027t get out of? Well, as I sit at Chicago\u0027s O\u0027Hare International Airport on a Monday afternoon during the one hour and forty-five minute delay, I think about the past twenty-four hours of my now messed-up life.\\n\\n I was sitting in my room yesterday when my biological father, Ron, called. No, you don\u0027t get it...Ron never calls. Well, unless it\u0027s my birthday, and that was eight months ago.\\n\\n You see, after their affair in college, my mom found out she was pregnant. She comes from money, and Ron ...well, he doesn\u0027t. Mom, with her parents pushing her along, told Ron it would be best if he didn\u0027t have a big part in our lives. Boy, were they wrong. But the worst part is he gave up without even trying.\\n\\n I know he puts money into an account for me. He also comes by to take me out to dinner for my birthdays. But so what? I want a father who\u0027ll always be there for me.\\n\\n He used to come around more, but I finally told him to leave me alone so my mom could find me a real dad. I didn\u0027t really mean it; I guess I was just trying to test him. He failed miserably.\\n\\n Well, the guy phones this time and tells my mom he wants to take me to Israel. Israel! You know, that little country in the Middle East that causes so much controversy. You don\u0027t have to TiVo the news to know Israel is a hotbed of international hostility.\\n\\n I know I\u0027m off on a tangent, so let\u0027s get back to what happened. My mom hands me the phone without so much as an \"it\u0027s your dad\" or \"it\u0027s the guy who I had a one-night stand with, but never married\" to warn me it was him.\\n\\n I still remember what he said. \"Hi, Amy. It\u0027s Ron.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\" I answer.\\n\\n I\u0027m not trying to be a smartass, it just doesn\u0027t register that the guy who gave me fifty percent of my genes is actually calling me.\\n\\n \"Ron ...Ron Barak,\" he says a bit louder and slower as if I\u0027m a complete imbecile.\\n\\n I freeze and end up saying nothing. Believe it or not, sometimes saying nothing actually works in my favor. I\u0027ve learned this from years of practice. It makes people nervous and, well, better them than me. I huff loudly to let him know I\u0027m still on the line.\\n\\n \"Amy?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\"\\n\\n \"Um, I just wanted you to know dat your grand mudder is sick,\" he says in his Israeli accent.\\n\\n A faceless image of a small white-haired old lady who smells like baby powder and mildew, and whose life\u0027s goal is baking chocolate chip cookies, briefly races across my mind.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know I had a grandmother,\" I say, emphasizing the \u0027th\u0027 because Ron, like every other Israeli I\u0027ve ever met, can\u0027t say the \u0027th\u0027--that sound is not in their language.\\n\\n My mom\u0027s mom died shortly after I was born so I was one of those kids without a grandma. A pang of sorrow and self-pity from never knowing I had a grandma and now knowing she\u0027s \u0027sick\u0027 makes me feel yucky. But I shove those feelings into the back of my head where they\u0027re safe.\\n\\n Ron clears his throat. \"She lives in Israel and, uh, I\u0027m going for the summer. I\u0027d like to take you with me.\"\\n\\n Israel?\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not Jewish,\" I blurt out.\\n\\n A little sound, like one of pain, escapes from his mouth before he says, \"You don\u0027t have to be Jewish to go to Israel, Amy.\"\\n\\n And you don\u0027t have to be a rocket scientist to know Israel is smack dab in the middle of a war zone. A war zone!\\n\\n \"Thanks for the offer, but I\u0027m going to tennis camp this summer. Tell Grandma I hope she gets over her illness. Bye,\" I say and hang up.\\n\\n Wouldn\u0027t you know it, not more than four seconds go by before the phone rings again. I know it\u0027s Ron. A little ironic he\u0027s hardly called twice in a year and here he is calling twice in a matter of seconds.\\n\\n My mom picks up the phone in the living room. I try to listen through my bedroom door. I can\u0027t hear much. Just mumble, mumble, mumble. After about forty long minutes she comes knocking at my door and tells me to pack for Israel.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\\n\\n \"Amy, you can\u0027t avoid him forever. It\u0027s not fair.\"\\n\\n Not fair? I cross my arms in front of my chest. \"Excuse me, what\u0027s not fair is that you two didn\u0027t even try and live like parents. Don\u0027t talk to me about fairness.\"\\n\\n I know I\u0027m sixteen and should be over it by now, but I\u0027m not. I never said I was perfect.\\n\\n \"Life isn\u0027t simple, you\u0027ll realize that when you\u0027re older,\" she says. \"We\u0027ve all made mistakes in the past, but it\u0027s time to mend them. You\u0027re going. It\u0027s already settled.\"\\n\\n Panic starts to set in and I decide to take the guilt trip route.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be killed. Unless that\u0027s what you ultimately want--\"\\n\\n \"Amy, stop the dramatics. He\u0027s promised me he\u0027ll keep you safe. It\u0027ll be a great experience.\"\\n\\n I try for another two hours to get out of it, I really do. I should have known trying to argue with my mom would get me nothing except a sore throat.\\n\\n I decide to call my best friend, Jessica. Supportive, understanding Jessica. \"Hey, Amy, what\u0027s up?\" a cheery voice answers on the other end of the line. Gotta love caller ID.\\n\\n \"My parents decided to ruin my life,\" I tell her.\\n\\n \"What do you mean \u0027parents\u0027? Ron called?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah, he called. And somehow he convinced my mom to cancel my summer plans so he could take me to Israel. Could you just die?\"\\n\\n \"Um, you don\u0027t really want to hear my opinion, Amy. Trust me.\"\\n\\n My eyebrows furrow as I slowly realize Jessica, my very dearest friend in the world, isn\u0027t going to back me up one hundred and ten percent.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a war zone!\" I say it slowly so she gets the full impact.\\n\\n Is that a laugh I hear on the other end of the line?\\n\\n \"Are you kidding?\" Jessica says. \"Heck, my mom goes to Tel Aviv every year to go shopping. She says they have the clearest diamonds ever cut. You know the little black dress I love? She got it for me there. They have the best European styles and--\"\\n\\n \"I need support here, Jess, not some crap about diamonds and clothes,\" I say, cutting off her \u0027Israel is all that\u0027 speech. Jeez!\\n\\n \"Sorry. You\u0027re right,\" she says.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you ever watch the news?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, Israel has its share of problems. But my parents say a lot of what we see on TV is propaganda. Just don\u0027t hang out at bus stops or go to coffee shops. Ron will keep you safe.\"\\n\\n \"Ha,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Are you mad at me?\" Jess asks. \"I could lie and tell you your life is ruined beyond repair. Would that make you feel better?\"\\n\\n Jessica is the only person who can make fun of me and get away with it. \"You\u0027re just a laugh a minute, Jess. You know I\u0027d never get mad at you, you\u0027re my BFF.\"\\n\\n Although what does it say about our friendship when my BFF has no problems sending me into a war zone?\\n\\n Less than twenty-four hours later I\u0027m sitting in the airport waiting for our El Al Israel Airlines flight to start boarding.\\n\\n Looking around, I watch a guy in a dark suit as he crouches on the floor and examines the underside of each row of benches. If he finds a bomb, will he know how to disarm it?\\n\\n I glance at my biological father, the almost non-existent man in my life, who\u0027s reading the newspaper. He tried talking to me on the way to the airport. I cut him off by putting on my headphones and listening to my iPod.\\n\\n As if he knows I\u0027m staring at him, he puts his paper down and turns my way. His hair is short. It\u0027s thick and dark, just like mine. I know if he\u0027d grow it out it would be curly, too. As hard as it is, I straighten my curly hair every morning. I hate my hair.\\n\\n My mom\u0027s eyes are green, mine are blue. People say my eyes are such a bright blue they glow. I consider my eyes my best feature.\\n\\n Unfortunately, the main thing I inherited from Mom is a big chest. Besides changing my hair, I\u0027d like to have smaller boobs. When I play tennis, they get in the way. Have you ever tried a two-handed backhand with mongo boobs? They seriously should have handicaps in tennis for people with big chests.\\n\\n When I get older maybe I\u0027ll get a reduction. But Jessica said during a boob reduction the doctor removes your whole areola ...you know, that pinky part in the middle of your boob, and then after they take out the excess boob they reattach the areola.\\n\\n I don\u0027t think I\u0027d like my pinky parts detached at all.\\n\\n As I think about detached areolas, I realize Ron is still looking at me. Although from the expression on his face he probably thinks I\u0027m disgusted with him. I can\u0027t possibly explain I\u0027m thinking of what I\u0027d actually look like with detached pinky parts.\\n\\n Anyway, I\u0027m still mad at him for bringing me on this stupid trip in the first place. Because of him, I had to drop out of tennis camp this summer. Which means I probably won\u0027t make it on the high school team when tryouts start in the fall. I totally want to make the varsity team.\\n\\n To make matters worse, Mitch, my boyfriend, won\u0027t even know I\u0027m gone. He went camping with his dad for a couple weeks on a \u0027cell phone free\u0027 vacation. It\u0027s still a new relationship. If we\u0027re not together the rest of the summer, he just might find someone else who will be there for him.\\n\\n I don\u0027t even know why Ron wants me to go with him. He doesn\u0027t even like me. Mom probably wanted me out of the house so she could have privacy with her latest guy.\\n\\n Her current boyfriend, Marc with a \u0027c\u0027, thinks he\u0027s the one. As if. Doesn\u0027t he realize once Mom meets someone bigger or better he\u0027s out of the picture?\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to the bathroom,\" I say to Ron.\\n\\n I really don\u0027t have to go, but I take my purse and walk down the hallway. When I get out of Ron\u0027s line of vision, I take out my trusty cell phone and keep walking. Mom got me the cell \"for emergencies only.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m definitely feeling an emergency coming on.\\n\\n CHAPTER 2\\n\\n Being on an airplane for twelve hours should be outlawed.\\n\\n I walk farther down the hallway and dial Jessica\u0027s number.\\n\\n \"Please be home,\" I pray as I stop by a window and look out at airplanes parked at their gates.\\n\\n I usually don\u0027t pray; it\u0027s not in my nature. But desperate times call for desperate measures and I\u0027m nothing if not flexible. Well, sometimes.\\n\\n \"Amy?\"\\n\\n I feel better already hearing her voice.\\n\\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s me. My flight is delayed.\"\\n\\n \"Are you still freaking out?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Tell me again why I shouldn\u0027t be worried?\"\\n\\n \"Amy, it won\u0027t be so bad. If there was anything I could do ...\"\\n\\n It\u0027s time to tell Jess of my plan. I just thought of it.\\n\\n \"There is one thing ...\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Come get me at the airport. International terminal. I\u0027ll be hiding by the, uh, Air Iberia arrivals. Wait for me there.\"\\n\\n \"Then what?\"\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll somehow get to go to tennis camp and ...oh, I don\u0027t know. Ron wants me to be a perfect daughter, but he\u0027s the crappiest dad ever--\"\\n\\n My cell phone is being snatched out of my hand, cutting my \u0027crappy dad\u0027 speech short. The snatcher, of course, is none other than the crapper himself.\\n\\n \"Hey, give that back!\" I say.\\n\\n \"Hello? Who is dis?\" Ron barks into my phone like an army commander with a speech impediment.\\n\\n I can\u0027t hear Jessica. I hope she doesn\u0027t answer him.\\n\\n \"Jessica, she\u0027ll call you when she can,\" he says, then snaps the cover shut.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t even give me a chance to tell her to call Mitch so he knows I\u0027m gone for the summer.\\n\\n \"Why? Why are you ruining my summer and taking me to Israel?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-1.html","bookId":2764,"book":{"id":2764,"title":"How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin a Summer Vacation (How to Ruin #1) \\n Moshav? What’s a moshav? Is it “shopping mall” in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I’d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. \\n Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, “moshav” is not Hebrew for “shopping mall.” Not even close. Think goats, not Gucci. \\n Going to Israel with her estranged Israeli father is the last thing Amy wants to do this summer. She’s got a serious grudge against her dad, a.k.a. “Sperm Donor,” for showing up so rarely in her life. Now he’s dragging her to a war zone to meet a family she’s never known, where she’ll probably be drafted into the army. At the very least, she’ll be stuck in a house with no AC and only one bathroom for seven people all summer—no best friend, no boyfriend, no shopping, no cell phone… \\n Goodbye pride—hello Israel.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.jpg","author":"Simone Elkeles","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:24 PM"}}
