They have his picture in the Rogues’ Gallery, and that can be copied and circulated, so that the authorities in different cities, and especially in this vicinity, can be on the lookout for him.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “But why weren’t the authorities on the lookout for him before?” questioned our hero. \\n\\n \\n\\n “They were at first. But then they got word that Jasniff had sailed for some port in South 203America, so they gave it up. Evidently the report was a false one.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, and probably circulated by Nick Jasniff himself,” added Roger. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Of course you have been over to Coburntown, where the gypsies went after they left here,” remarked Dave. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We have been all around that territory,” answered his Uncle Dunston. “The gypsies have disappeared entirely, one report stating that they were bound south. I had them stopped at a town about fifty miles away, and those in the camp were closely questioned. They said that Mother Domoza had been left behind on account of sickness, and that two gypsies, one named Tony Bopeppo, and the other Carlos Vazala, had remained with her to take care of her. They said the three were to go to another gypsy camp some twenty or thirty miles away. But at that camp it was said that they knew nothing about the old hag and her followers.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Were the two gypsies, Bopeppo and Vazala, the two with whom you had trouble about the land?” questioned Roger. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, they were the leaders in the quarrel,” answered Dunston Porter. “Bopeppo was particularly furious, and one day threatened to strike Mr. Basswood. I stopped him, and told him if he didn’t behave himself I’d have him placed under 204arrest. Vazala was also very vindictive, he asserting, along with Mother Domoza, that they had the right to occupy the land as long as they pleased.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then it is more than likely that Bopeppo and Vazala, assisted by Mother Domoza and perhaps by Nick Jasniff, are guilty of this kidnapping,” went on our hero. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We had figured it out that way—of course leaving out Jasniff.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Have you any sample of the handwriting of Bopeppo or Vazala?” asked Roger. “If you have you might compare them with the note sent to Mr. Wadsworth.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “We have managed to get one note written by Bopeppo, and we have two samples of Vazala’s signature. But neither of them seem to be in the handwriting used in the note,” answered Dave’s father. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then it would seem as if the note had been written by somebody else!” cried Dave. “How about Mother Domoza?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “We don’t believe the old hag can read or write English.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I’d like to see the note,” said Roger. Thereupon the communication was brought forth and the two young civil engineers scanned it very closely. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I wish I could remember Nick Jasniff’s handwriting, 205but I can’t,” said Roger. “How about it, Dave?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “If my memory serves me, he wrote rather a heavy hand,” answered our hero. “But I am not willing to say whether this is in his style or not. This looks to me as if it was a disguised hand, for it is very irregular.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “We all thought the handwriting was disguised,” answered Mr. Wadsworth. He heaved a deep sigh. “Too bad! All this talk doesn’t seem to get us anywhere.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, one thing is certain,” said Dave. “The girls got on board that train, and the train went to Boston, making all of its usual stops. In that case, they must have gotten off at one of the stop stations,—that is, unless the train made some other stops which were not scheduled.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “We have found out that the train did make a number of other stops,” answered his father. “Shortly after it left Hemston they discovered a hot box, and they had to stop four times on the way to fix that—twice near some water tanks, and twice at some cross-road signal towers. As a consequence of the delay, the train was also held up at two little way stations to let two express trains pass, and did not get into Boston until nearly two hours behind its regular time.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Have you got a list of all those stopping places?” questioned Roger. \\n\\n \\n\\n 206“We have.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then I know what I’m going to do,” cried Dave. “I’ll take the automobile and go along the line of the railroad and stop at every one of those places and make inquiries, and see if we can’t find out whether the girls left the train, or if they were met by the gypsies, or anybody else.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I’ve already been along the line, Dave,” answered his father. “Your uncle and I went over the route, not by automobile but by a way train, and we made inquiries at every station; but without the least success.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, but the train couldn’t have stopped long enough for you to ask many questions,” put in Roger. \\n\\n \\n\\n “That is true,” returned Dave’s parent slowly. “Probably you would have a better chance of getting some particulars if you went along the route in the automobile. Of course it would take considerable time—several days in fact—to follow the route in that manner all the way into Boston.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It’s the only thing I can think of to do,” answered Dave. “And it will be much better than sitting here and doing nothing.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Right you are!” cried Roger. “I’m willing to start this minute if you say so,” and he jumped to his feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I don’t think you can do much to-day,—it is too late,” answered Mr. Wadsworth. “But you 207might get ready for a start early to-morrow morning,” and he looked rather hopefully at the two young civil engineers. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We’ll do it!” answered Dave. \\n\\n \\n\\n After that the discussion became general, and our hero and his chum got all the particulars possible concerning the stops the train upon which Jessie and Laura had taken passage had made on its trip to the Hub. They put all these names and locations down on a sort of map that they drew up, and then consulted an automobile Blue-Book, so that they might get familiar with the roads to be taken on their tour. \\n\\n \\n\\n “This is certainly going to be some search, Dave,” remarked Roger, after the conference had come to an end and the two chums had gone up-stairs to fix up for dinner. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I know it, Roger. It will probably take us several days, and maybe a week. But I won’t mind that, and neither will you, if only we learn something of advantage.” \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a quiet party that sat down to the table that evening in the large dining room of the Wadsworth mansion. In a voice that trembled more than usual with emotion, old Professor Potts asked a blessing on the meal, and the repast was well on its way before anyone felt like talking. Then Roger questioned Mr. Wadsworth concerning the automobile to be taken for the trip. \\n\\n \\n\\n 208“I think you had better take the four-passenger car,” announced the jewelry manufacturer. “That will leave us the large car in case we need it. The smaller car is in just as good a condition and is just as speedy.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “We’ll look over the car as soon as we have finished eating,” said Dave. “I want everything to be in the best of order, so that we shall not be delayed by any breakdown. Of course, we’ll carry along an extra shoe or two, and three or four inner tubes.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The two chums had already decided on what they were to wear on the trip and what to take along in the way of extra clothing. They spent the entire evening in going over the four-passenger car, and, with the aid of the Wadsworth chauffeur, put the machine in the best possible order, and then filled it up with oil and gasoline. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, boys, you’ll do your best to find them?” said Mrs. Wadsworth, when they came in rather late and were ready to retire. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You can rest assured of that, Mrs. Wadsworth,” answered Dave. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We won’t give up until we have found them, or found out something about them,” broke in Roger. And then the lady kissed each of them affectionately. The strain had been terrible, and she looked ten years older than usual. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dave and Roger had expected that no one 209would be around when they were ready to depart in the morning, for it was but a little after sunrise. But in this they were mistaken. Both Dave’s father and his Uncle Dunston had come down to see them off. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I want to caution you about one thing,” said Dave’s parent. “You take care of yourselves, and if you do chance to run into those gypsies, or anybody else who has any connection with this crime, do your best to keep out of trouble.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “We’ll be on our guard, Dad, don’t fear,” answered the son. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Of course you are armed?” questioned Dunston Porter. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, we’ve each got a pistol, and Dave’s shotgun is under the back seat,” answered Roger. “You see, we weren’t going to take any chances,” and he smiled grimly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “If you discover anything at all, send us word at once,” went on Dave’s father. “Use the telegraph or the telephone—whichever is handiest.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You can depend on it we will,” said Dave. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And don’t forget that we want to hear from you folks here in Crumville if you hear anything,” added Roger. “You can send a message to any of the railroad stations along the line. We’ll stop at each station and ask for messages.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Dave was at the wheel of the car, with Roger alongside of him. In the back the two had their 210suit-cases, and also a number of wraps and a hamper filled with lunch, for there was no telling where they could stop along the road for something to eat. \\n\\n \\n\\n With scarcely an effort, the touring-car rolled away from the Wadsworth mansion, the men left behind waving their hands to the two on board. They waved in return, and a moment later the machine left the grounds, headed for the Crumville railroad station. This was soon passed, and they took the highway leading to the next station on the line; and thus the great search was begun. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first place they reached was a small way-station, and they soon learned that the particular train Laura and Jessie had taken had not stopped there for a month or more. The station master had, however, heard about the kidnapping, and was anxious to hear more. But Dave and Roger did not waste time on him. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the course of the next couple of hours, they stopped at six more stations, and made various inquiries. The train had stopped at just one of these places, but the station agent was positive that only two of the local residents had gotten on board, and no one but a drummer from the city had alighted. \\n\\n \\n\\n The way to the next station was up a long hill, and near the top Dave had to bring the car to a sudden halt. The regular road was being repaired, 211and a sign was up showing where a detour might be made. \\n\\n \\n\\n “That side-road doesn’t look very inviting,” was our hero’s comment, as he surveyed it. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, it must be all right,” answered Roger. “If it were not, they wouldn’t have that sign up.” \\n\\n \\n\\n They proceeded on their way, and soon found the side road both rough and uncertain. They had some difficulty in getting to the bottom of the hill, and here they had to make a sharp turn to the left in an endeavor to get back to the main highway. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Look out for the puddles, Dave!” cried the senator’s son, as they splashed into one pool of water. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dave did what he could to keep out of the next puddle, and in doing this ran pretty well off to one side of the roadway. The next instant he found himself in mud almost up to the hubs, and here the car threatened to come to a standstill. He immediately threw the gear into second, and then into low, and thus they chugged on for a distance of ten or twelve feet farther. Then the car came to a sudden standstill. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Stuck?” remarked Roger laconically. \\n\\n \\n\\n “So it would seem,” answered Dave. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1904/54823.html","bookId":921,"book":{"id":921,"title":"Dave Porter\u0027s Great Search","description":"简介： This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the original.
