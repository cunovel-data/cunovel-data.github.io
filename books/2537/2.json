{"id":110086,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"EVEN IF YOU LOVE YOUR JOB, THE LAST DAY OF VACATION ALWAYS MAKES you feel depressed. Just one week earlier I\u0027d been roasting on a nice clean Spanish beach, eating paella (to be quite honest, Uzbek pilaf is better), drinking cold sangria in a little Chinese restaurant (how come the Chinese make the Spanish national drink better than the natives do?) and buying all sorts of rubbishy resort souvenirs in the little shops.\\n\\n But now it was summer in Moscow again¡ªnot exactly hot, but stifling and oppressive¡ªand it was that final day of vacation, when you can\u0027t get your head to relax anymore, but it flatly refuses to work.\\n\\n Maybe that was why I felt glad when I got the call from Gesar.\\n\\n \"Good morning, Anton,\" the boss began, without introducing himself. \"Welcome back. Did you know it was me?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d been able to sense Gesar\u0027s calls for some time already. It was as if the trilling of the phone changed subtly, becoming more demanding and authoritative.\\n\\n But I was in no rush to let the boss know that.\\n\\n \"Yes, Boris Ignatievich.\"\\n\\n \"Are you alone?\"\\n\\n An unnecessary question. I was certain Gesar knew perfectly well where Svetlana was just then.\\n\\n \"Yes. The girls are at the dacha.\"\\n\\n \"Good for them,\" the boss sighed at the other end of the line, and an entirely human note appeared in his voice. \"Olga flew off on vacation this morning too... half the Watch staff are sunning themselves in southern climes... Think you could come around to the office right away?\"\\n\\n Before I had time to answer, Gesar went on cheerily. \"Well, that\u0027s excellent! See you in forty minutes, then.\"\\n\\n I really felt like calling Gesar a cheap poser¡ªafter I hung up, of course. But I kept my mouth shut. In the first place, the boss could hear what I said without any telephone. And in the second, whatever else he might be, he was no cheap poser. He simply didn\u0027t like wasting time. If I was about to say I\u0027d be there in forty minutes, what point was there in listening to me say it?\\n\\n Anyway, I was really glad I\u0027d gotten the call. The day was already shot to hell. It was still too early to tidy up the apartment (like any self-respecting man whose family is away, I only do that once, on the final day of bachelor life). And I definitely didn\u0027t feel like going around to see anyone or inviting anyone back to my place either. By far the most useful thing would be to go back to work a day early¡ªthat way, I could ask for time off with a clear conscience when I needed to.\\n\\n Even though asking for time off wasn\u0027t something we did.\\n\\n \"Thanks, boss,\" I said with real feeling. I detached myself from the armchair, put down the book I hadn\u0027t finished, and stretched.\\n\\n And then the phone rang again.\\n\\n Of course, it would have been just like Gesar to ring and say, \"You\u0027re welcome!\" But that definitely would have been cheap clowning.\\n\\n \"Hello,\" I said in a very businesslike tone.\\n\\n \"Anton, it\u0027s me.\"\\n\\n \"Svetka,\" I said, sitting back down again. And suddenly I tensed up¡ªSvetlana\u0027s voice sounded uneasy, anxious. \"Svetka, has something happened to Nadya?\"\\n\\n \"Everything\u0027s fine,\" she replied quickly. \"Don\u0027t worry. Why don\u0027t you tell me how you\u0027ve been getting on?\"\\n\\n I thought for a few seconds. I hadn\u0027t held any drinking parties, I hadn\u0027t brought any women back home, I wasn\u0027t drowning in garbage, I\u0027d even been washing the dishes...\\n\\n And then I realized.\\n\\n \"Gesar called. Just a moment ago.\"\\n\\n \"What does he want?\" Svetlana asked quickly.\\n\\n \"Nothing special. He asked me to turn up for work today.\"\\n\\n \"Anton, I sensed something. Something bad. Did you say yes? Are you going to work?\"\\n\\n \"Why not? I\u0027ve got absolutely nothing else to do.\"\\n\\n Svetlana said nothing on the other end of the line (although, what lines are there with cell phones?). Then she said reluctantly, \"You know, I felt a sort of pricking in my heart. Do you believe I can sense trouble?\"\\n\\n I laughed. \"Yes, Great One.\"\\n\\n \"Anton, be serious, will you!\" Svetlana was instantly uptight, the way she always got when I called her Great One. \"Listen to me... if Gesar asks you to do something, say no.\"\\n\\n \"Sveta, if Gesar called me in, it means he wants to ask me to do something. It means he needs more help. He says everyone\u0027s on vacation...\"\\n\\n \"He needs more cannon fodder,\" Svetlana snapped. \"Anton... never mind, you won\u0027t listen to me anyway. Just be careful.\"\\n\\n \"Svetka, you don\u0027t seriously think that Gesar\u0027s going to put me in any danger, do you?\" I said cautiously. \"I understand the way you feel about him...\"\\n\\n \"Be careful,\" said Svetlana. \"For our sake. All right?\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" I promised. \"I\u0027m always very careful.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call if I sense anything else,\" said Svetlana. She seemed to have calmed down a bit. \"And you call, all right? If anything at all unusual happens, call. Okay?\"\\n\\n \"Okay, I\u0027ll call.\"\\n\\n Svetlana paused for a few seconds, then before she hung up said, \"You ought to leave the Watch, third-class Light Magician...\"\\n\\n It all ended on a suspiciously light note, with a cheap jibe... Although we had agreed not to discuss that subject a long time ago¡ªthree years earlier, when Svetlana left the Night Watch. And we hadn\u0027t broken our promise once. Of course, I used to tell my wife about my work... at least, about the jobs that I wanted to remember. And she always listened with interest. But now she had come right out with it.\\n\\n Could she really have sensed something bad?\\n\\n The result was that I got ready to go slowly and reluctantly. I put on a suit, then changed into jeans and a checked shirt, then thought \"to hell with it\" and got into my shorts and a black t-shirt with an inscription that said: \"My friend was in a state of clinical death, and all he brought me from the next world was this T-shirt!\" I might look like a jolly German tourist, but at least I would retain the semblance of a holiday mood in front of Gesar...\\n\\n Eventually I left the building with just twenty minutes to go before the time set by the boss was up. I had to flag down a car and feel out the probability lines, and then tell the driver which streets to take so we wouldn\u0027t hit any traffic jams.\\n\\n The driver accepted my instructions reluctantly¡ªhe obviously had serious doubts.\\n\\n But we got there on time.\\n\\n The elevators weren\u0027t working¡ªthere were guys in blue overalls loading paper sacks of cement into them. I set off up the stairs on foot, and discovered that the second floor of our office was being refurbished. There were workmen lining the walls with sheets of plasterboard, and plasterers bustling about beside them, filling in the seams. At the same time they were installing a false ceiling, which already covered the air-conditioning pipes.\\n\\n So our office manager Vitaly Markovich had gotten his own way after all. He\u0027d managed to get the boss to shell out for a full-scale renovation, and even worked out where to get the money from.\\n\\n I stopped for a moment and took a look at the workmen through the Twilight. Ordinary people, not Others, as I ought to have expected. There was only one plasterer, who wasn\u0027t much to look at, whose aura seemed suspicious. But after a second I realized he was simply in love. With his own wife! Well, would you ever... there were still a few good people left in the world.\\n\\n The third and fourth floors had already been refurbished and that assured my good mood. At long last it would be cool in the IT department too. Not that I was in there every day now, but even so... As I ran past I greeted the security guards who had clearly been posted here for the duration of the renovation. Just as I got to Gesar\u0027s office, I ran into Semyon. He was impressing something on Yulia in a serious, didactic tone of voice.\\n\\n How time did fly... Three years earlier Yulia had still been just a little girl. Now she was a beautiful young woman. And a very promising enchantress¡ªshe had already been invited to join the European office of the Night Watch. They like to skim off the young talent¡ªto a multilingual chorus of protestations about the great common cause...\\n\\n But this time they hadn\u0027t gotten away with it. Gesar had held on to Yulia, and in addition let them know that he could recruit young European talent if he felt like it.\\n\\n I wondered what Yulia herself had wanted in that situation.\\n\\n \"Been called back in?\" Semyon enquired sympathetically, breaking off his conversation the moment he spotted me. \"Or is your time up already?\"\\n\\n \"My time\u0027s up, and I\u0027ve been called in,\" I said. \"Has something happened? Hi, Yulka.\"\\n\\n For some reason Semyon and I never said hello, as if we\u0027d only just seen each other. Anyway, he always looked exactly the same¡ªdressed very simply, carelessly shaved, with the crumpled face of a peasant who has moved into the big city.\\n\\n That day, in fact, Semyon was looking homelier than ever.\\n\\n \"Hi, Anton,\" Yulia said. Her expression was glum. It looked as though Semyon had been educating her again¡ªhe was a past master at that sort of thing.\\n\\n \"Nothing\u0027s happened,\" Semyon said with a shake of his head. \"Everything\u0027s perfectly calm. Last week we only picked up two witches, and that was for petty offenses.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s just great,\" I said, trying not to notice Yulia\u0027s imploring glance. \"I\u0027ll go see the boss.\"\\n\\n Semyon nodded and turned back toward the girl. As I walked into the boss\u0027s reception room, I heard him saying, \"So listen, Yulia, I\u0027ve been doing the same job for sixty years now, but this kind of irresponsible behavior...\"\\n\\n He\u0027s strict all right, but he never gives anyone a hard time without good reason, so I wasn\u0027t about to rescue Yulia from the conversation.\\n\\n In the reception area there was a new air conditioner quietly humming away and the ceiling was dotted with tiny halogen bulbs for accent lighting. Larissa was sitting there¡ªevidently Gesar\u0027s secretary, Galochka, was on vacation, and our field work coordinators really didn\u0027t have much work of their own to do.\\n\\n \"Hello, Anton,\" Larissa said to me. \"You\u0027re looking good.\"\\n\\n \"Two weeks on the beach!\" I replied proudly.\\n\\n Larissa squinted at the clock. \"I was told to show you right in. But the boss still has visitors. Will you go in?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I decided. \"Seems like I needn\u0027t have bothered hurrying.\"\\n\\n \"Gorodetsky\u0027s here to see you, Boris Ignatievich,\" Larissa said into the intercom. She nodded to me. \"Go on in... oh, it\u0027s hot in there...\"\\n\\n It really was hot inside Gesar\u0027s door. There were two middle-aged men I didn\u0027t know languishing in the armchairs in front of his desk¡ªI mentally christened them Thin Man and Fat Man, after Chekhov\u0027s short story. But both of them were sweating.\\n\\n \"And what do we observe?\" Gesar asked them reproachfully. He cast a sideways glance at me. \"Come in, Anton. Sit down, I\u0027ll be finished in a moment...\"\\n\\n Thin Man and Fat Man perked up a bit at that.\\n\\n \"Some mediocre housewife... distorting all the facts... vulgarizing and simplifying everything... running rings around you! On a global scale!\"\\n\\n \"She can do that precisely because she vulgarizes and simplifies,\" Fat Man retorted morosely.\\n\\n \"You told us to tell everything like it is,\" Thin Man said in support. \"And this is the result, Most Lucent Gesar!\"\\n\\n I took a look at Gesar\u0027s visitors through the Twilight. Well, well! More human beings! And yet they knew the boss\u0027s name and title! And they even pronounced them with candid sarcasm! Of course, there are always special circumstances, but for Gesar to reveal himself to ordinary people...\\n\\n \"All right,\" Gesar said with a nod. \"I\u0027ll let you have one more try. This time work separately.\"\\n\\n Thin Man and Fat Man exchanged glances.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll do our best,\" Fat Man said with a good-natured smile. \"You understand, though¡ªwe\u0027ve already had a certain degree of success...\"\\n\\n Gesar snorted. As if they\u0027d been given some invisible signal that the conversation was over, the visitors stood up, shook the boss\u0027s hand in farewell and walked out. In the reception area Thin Man made some amusing and flirtatious remark to Larissa, and she laughed.\\n\\n \"Ordinary people?\" I asked cautiously.\\n\\n Gesar nodded, gazing at the door with a hostile expression. He sighed.\\n\\n \"People, people... All right, Gorodetsky. Sit down.\"\\n\\n I sat down, but Gesar still didn\u0027t start the conversation. He fiddled with his papers, fingered some bright-colored, smoothly polished glass beads heaped up in a coarse earthenware bowl. I felt like looking to see if they were amulets or really just glass beads, but I didn\u0027t want to risk taking any liberties in front of Gesar.\\n\\n \"How was your vacation?\" Gesar asked, as if he\u0027d exhausted all his excuses for delaying the conversation.\\n\\n \"Good,\" I answered. \"I missed Sveta, of course. But I couldn\u0027t drag little Nadya out into that scorching Spanish sun. That\u0027s no good...\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Gesar agreed, \"it isn\u0027t.\" I didn\u0027t know if the Great Magician had any children¡ªeven close associates weren\u0027t trusted with information like that. He probably did. He was almost certainly capable of experiencing something like paternal feelings. \"Anton, did you phone Svetlana?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said and shook my head. \"Has she contacted you?\"\\n\\n Gesar nodded. Then suddenly he couldn\u0027t contain himself any longer¡ªhe slammed his fist down on the desk and burst out: \"Just what did she think she was doing? First she deserts the Watch...\"\\n\\n \"Gesar, every one of us has the right to resign,\" I objected. But Gesar had no intention of apologizing.\\n\\n \"Deserts! An enchantress of her level doesn\u0027t belong to herself! She has no right to belong to herself! If, that is... if she calls herself a Light One... And then¡ªshe\u0027s raising her daughter as a human being!\"\\n\\n \"Nadya is a human being,\" I said, feeling myself starting to fume too. \"Whether or not she becomes an Other is for her to decide... Most Lucent Gesar!\"\\n\\n Gesar realized that I was all set to blow too and he changed his tone.\\n\\n \"Okay. That\u0027s your right. Pull out of the fight, ruin the little girl\u0027s life... anything you like! But where does this hate come from?\"\\n\\n \"What did Sveta say?\" I asked.\\n\\n Gesar sighed. \"Your wife phoned me. On a number that she has no right to know...\"\\n\\n \"Then she doesn\u0027t know it,\" I put in.\\n\\n \"And she told me I intended to have you killed! That I was hatching a highly complicated plot for your physical elimination!\"\\n\\n I looked into Gesar\u0027s eyes for a second. Then I laughed.\\n\\n \"You think it\u0027s funny?\" Gesar asked in a voice filled with pain. \"You really think so?\"\\n\\n \"Gesar...\" I said, suppressing my laughter with an effort. \"I\u0027m sorry. May I speak frankly?\"\\n\\n \"By all means...\"\\n\\n \"You are the greatest plotter of anybody I know. Worse than Zabulon. Compared to you, Machiavelli was a mere pup...\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be so quick to underestimate Machiavelli,\" Gesar growled. \"I get the idea, I\u0027m a plotter. And?\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m sure you have no intention of getting me killed. In a crisis, perhaps, you might sacrifice me. In order to save a commensurately greater number of people or Light Others. But not that way... by planning... and scheming... I don\u0027t believe it.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, I\u0027m glad to hear it,\" Gesar said with a nod. I couldn\u0027t tell if I\u0027d nettled him or not. \"Then what on earth has Svetlana gotten into her head? I\u0027m sorry, Anton...\" Gesar suddenly hesitated and even looked away, but he finished what he was saying. \"Are you expecting a child? Another one?\"\\n\\n I choked and shook my head. \"No... at least, I don\u0027t think so... no, she would have told me.\"\\n\\n \"Women sometimes go a bit crazy when they\u0027re expecting a child,\" Gesar growled and started fingering his glass beads again. \"They start seeing danger everywhere¡ªfor the child, for their husband, for themselves... Or maybe now she has...\" But then the Great Magician got really embarrassed and stopped himself short. \"That\u0027s rubbish... forget it. Why don\u0027t you pay your wife a visit in the country, play with your daughter, drink some milk fresh from the cow...\"\\n\\n \"My vacation ends tomorrow,\" I reminded him. Oh, there was something not right here! \"And I thought the idea was that I was going to work today?\"\\n\\n Gesar stared hard at me. \"Anton, forget about work! Svetlana shouted at me for fifteen minutes. If she was a Dark One, there\u0027d be an Inferno Vortex hanging over my head right now. That\u0027s it, work\u0027s cancelled. I\u0027m extending your vacation for a week¡ª go to the country and see your wife!\"\\n\\n In the Moscow department of the Watch we have a saying: \"There are three things a Light Other can\u0027t do: organize his own personal life, achieve worldwide peace and happiness, and get time off from Gesar.\" To be honest, I was quite happy with my personal life, and now I\u0027d been given an extra week of vacation. So maybe worldwide peace and happiness were only just around the corner?\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you pleased?\" Gesar asked.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I admitted. No, I wasn\u0027t inspired by the prospect of weeding the vegetable beds under the watchful eye of my mother-in-law. But Sveta and Nadya would be there. Nadya, Nadyenka, Nadiushka. My little two-year-old miracle. A lovely little human being... Potentially an Other of immense power. An Enchantress so very Great that Gesar himself couldn\u0027t hold a candle to her. I imagined the Great Light Magician Gesar standing there holding a candle, so that little Nadya could play with her toys, and grinned.\\n\\n \"Call into the accounts office, they\u0027ll issue you a bonus...\" Gesar continued, not suspecting the humiliation I was subjecting him to in my mind. \"Think up the citation for yourself. Something like... for many years of conscientious service...\"\\n\\n \"Gesar, what kind of job was it?\" I asked.\\n\\n Gesar stopped talking and tried to drill right through me with his gaze. When he got nowhere, he said, \"When I tell you everything, you will phone Svetlana. From here. And you\u0027ll ask her if you should agree or not. Okay? And you tell her about the extra vacation too.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s happened?\"\\n\\n Instead of replying, Gesar pulled open the drawer of the desk, took out a black leather folder and held it out to me. The folder had a distinct aura of magic¡ªpowerful, dangerous battle magic.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, open it, you\u0027ve been granted access...\" Gesar growled.\\n\\n I opened the folder¡ªat that point any unauthorized Other or human being would have been reduced to a handful of ash.\\n\\n Inside the folder was a letter. Just one single envelope. The address of our office was written in newsprint, carefully cut out and stuck onto the envelope. And, naturally, there was no return address.\\n\\n \"The letters have been cut out of three newspapers,\" said Gesar. \"Pravda, Kommersant, and Arguments and Facts.\"\\n\\n \"Ingenious,\" I remarked. \"Can I open it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, do. The forensic experts have already done everything they can with the envelope¡ªthere aren\u0027t any fingerprints. The glue was made in China and it\u0027s on sale in every newspaper kiosk.\"\\n\\n \"And it\u0027s written on toilet paper!\" I exclaimed in absolute delight as I took the letter out of the envelope. \"Is it clean at least?\"\\n\\n \"Unfortunately,\" said Gesar. \"Not the slightest trace of organic matter. Standard cheap pulp. \u0027Fifty-four meters\u0027, they call it.\"\\n\\n The sheet of toilet paper had been carelessly torn off along the perforation and the text was glued onto it in different-sized letters. Or rather, in entire words, with a few endings added separately, and with no regard for the typeface:\\n\\n \"The NIGHT WATCH should BE INTERESTED to know that a CERTAIN Other has REVEALed to a CERTAIN human being the entire truth about oTHErs and now inTENDs to turn this human beING into an OTHER. A wellWISHer.\"\\n\\n I would have laughed, but somehow I didn\u0027t feel like it. Instead, I remarked perspicaciously, \" \u0027Night Watch\u0027 is written in complete words...\"\\n\\n \"There was an article in Arguments and Facts,\" Gesar explained. \"About a fire at the TV tower. It was called NIGHT WATCH ON THE OSTANKINO TOWER.\"\\n\\n \"Clever,\" I agreed. The mention of the tower gave me a slight twinge. That hadn\u0027t exactly been the best time of my life... And those weren\u0027t the most enjoyable adventures I\u0027d ever had. I would be haunted for the rest of my days by the face of the Dark Other I threw off the TV tower in the Twilight...\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t get moody, Anton, you didn\u0027t do anything wrong,\" said Gesar. \"Let\u0027s get down to business.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s do that, Boris Ignatievich,\" I said, calling the boss by his old \"civilian\" name. \"Is this for real, then?\"\\n\\n Gesar shrugged. \"There\u0027s not even a whiff of magic from the letter. It was either composed by a human being, or by a competent Other who can cover his tracks. If it\u0027s a human being... that means there has to be a leak somewhere. If it\u0027s an Other... it\u0027s an absolutely irresponsible act of provocation.\"\\n\\n \"No traces at all?\" I asked again to make sure.\\n\\n \"None. The only clue is the postmark.\" Gesar frowned. \"But that looks very much like a red herring...\"\\n\\n \"Why¡ªwas the letter sent from the Kremlin, then?\" I quipped.\\n\\n \"Almost. The mailbox the letter was posted in is located on the grounds of the Assol complex.\"\\n\\n Great tall buildings with red roofs¡ªthe kind Comrade Stalin would have been sure to approve of. I\u0027d seen them. But only from a distance.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t just go walking in there!\"\\n\\n \"No, you can\u0027t,\" Gesar said with a nod. \"So, in sending the letter from the Assol residences after all this subterfuge with the paper, the glue, and the letters, our unknown correspondent either committed a crude error...\"\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \"Or he\u0027s leading us onto a false trail...\" At this point Gesar paused, observing my reaction closely.\\n\\n I thought for a moment. And then shook my head again, \"That\u0027s very naive. No.\"\\n\\n \"Or the \u0027wellwisher,\u0027\" Gesar pronounced the final word with frank sarcasm, \"really does want to give us a clue.\"\\n\\n \"What for?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"He sent the letter for some reason,\" Gesar reminded me. \"As you well understand, Anton, we have to react to this letter somehow. Let\u0027s assume the worst¡ªthere\u0027s a traitor among the Others, who can reveal the secret of our existence to the human race.\"\\n\\n \"But who\u0027s going to believe him?\"\\n\\n \"They won\u0027t believe a human being. But they will believe an Other who can demonstrate his abilities.\"\\n\\n Gesar was right, of course. But I couldn\u0027t make sense of why anyone would do such a thing. Even the stupidest and most malicious Dark One had to understand what would happen after the truth was revealed. A new witch hunt, that was what. And people would gladly cast both the Dark Ones and the Light Ones in the role of the witches. Everyone who possessed the abilities of an Other...\\n\\n Including Sveta. Including little Nadya.\\n\\n \"How is it possible \u0027to turn this human being into an Other\u0027?\" I asked. \"Vampirism?\"\\n\\n \"Vampires, werewolves...\" Gesar shrugged. \"That\u0027s it, I suppose. Initiation is possible at the very crudest, most primitive levels of Dark Power, but it would have to be paid for by sacrificing the human essence. It\u0027s impossible to turn a human being into a magician by initiation.\"\\n\\n \"Nadiushka...\" I whispered. \"You rewrote Svetlana\u0027s Book of Destiny, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Gesar shook his head. \"No, Anton. Your daughter was destined to be born a Great One. All we did was make the sign more precise. We eliminated the element of chance...\"\\n\\n \"Egor,\" I reminded him. \"The boy had already become a Dark Other...\"\\n\\n \"But we erased the specific quality of his initiation. Gave him a chance to choose again,\" Gesar said and nodded. \"Anton, all the interventions that we are capable of only have to do with the choice of \u0027Dark\u0027 or \u0027Light.\u0027 But there\u0027s no way we can make the choice between \u0027human\u0027 or \u0027Other.\u0027 No one in this world can do that.\"\\n\\n \"Then that means we\u0027re talking about vampires,\" I said. \"Supposing the Dark Ones have another vampire who has fallen in love...\"\\n\\n Gesar spread his hands helplessly. \"Could be. Then everything\u0027s more or less simple. The Dark Ones will check their riffraff¡ªit\u0027s in their interest as much as ours... And yes, by the way. They received a letter too. Exactly the same. And sent from Assol too.\"\\n\\n \"How about the Inquisition¡ªdid they get one?\"\\n\\n \"You get shrewder and shrewder all the time,\" Gesar laughed. \"They got one too. By mail. From Assol.\"\\n\\n Gesar was clearly hinting at something. I thought for a moment and drew yet another shrewd conclusion.\\n\\n \"Then the investigation is being conducted by both Watches and the Inquisition?\"\\n\\n There was a brief flicker of disappointment in Gesar\u0027s glance.\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s the way it is. When it\u0027s absolutely necessary, in a private capacity, it is permissible to reveal yourself to human beings. You know yourself...\"he nodded toward the door through which his visitors had left. \"But that\u0027s a private matter. And the appropriate magical limitations are imposed. This situation is far worse than that. It looks as if one of the Others intends to trade in initiations.\"\\n\\n I imagined a vampire offering his services to rich New Russians and smiled. \"How would you like to drink the people\u0027s blood for real, my dear sir?\" But then, it wasn\u0027t all about blood. Even the very weakest vampire or werewolf possesses Power. They have no fear of disease. They live for a very, very long time. And their physical strength shouldn\u0027t be forgotten either¡ªany werewolf would beat Karelin and give Tyson a good whipping. And then there was their \"animal magnetism,\" the \"call\" that they had such complete control over. Any woman was yours for the taking, just summon her.\\n\\n Of course, in reality, both vampires and werewolves were bound by numerous restrictions. Even more so than magicians¡ªtheir instability required it. But did a newly initiated vampire really understand that?\\n\\n \"What are you smiling at?\" Gesar asked.\\n\\n \"I just imagined an announcement in a newspaper. T will turn you into a vampire. Safe, reliable, a hundred years guarantee. Price by arrangement.\u0027\"\\n\\n Gesar nodded. \"Good thinking. I\u0027ll have the newspapers and internet notice boards checked.\"\\n\\n I looked at Gesar, but I couldn\u0027t tell if he was joking or serious. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any real danger,\" I said. \"Most likely some crackpot vampire has decided to earn a bit of money. Showed some rich man a few tricks and offered to... er... bite him.\"\\n\\n \"One bite, and all your troubles are over,\" Gesar said encouragingly.\\n\\n Encouraged, I continued. \"Someone... for instance, this man\u0027s wife, found out about the terrible offer. While her husband is hesitating, she decided to write to us. Hoping that we\u0027ll eliminate the vampire and her husband will remain a human being. Hence the combination of letters cut out of newspapers and the post office in Assol. A cry for help. She can\u0027t tell us openly, but she\u0027s literally begging us: Save my husband!\"\\n\\n \"You hopeless romantic,\" Gesar said disapprovingly. \"So then she takes a pair of nail scissors, and snippety-snips the letters out of the latest Pravda... Did she get the addresses out of the newspapers too?\"\\n\\n \"The address of the Inquisition!\" I exclaimed, suddenly realizing the problem.\\n\\n \"Now there you\u0027re right. Could you send a letter to the Inquisition?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer. I\u0027d been put firmly in my place. And Gesar had told me straight out about the letter to the Inquisition.\\n\\n \"In our watch I\u0027m the only person who knows their address. In the Day Watch, I presume Zabulon is the only one. So where does that leave us, Gorodetsky?\"\\n\\n \"You sent the letter. Or Zabulon did.\"\\n\\n Gesar only snorted.\\n\\n \"And is the Inquisition really uptight about this?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Uptight is putting it mildly. In itself, the attempt to trade in initiations doesn\u0027t bother them. That\u0027s standard business for the watches¡ªidentify the perpetrator, punish him, and seal the leak. Especially since we and the Dark Ones are both equally outraged by what has happened... But a letter to the Inquisition¡ªthat\u0027s something really exceptional. There aren\u0027t very many of them, so you can see... If one side violates the Treaty,\\n\\n the Inquisition takes the other side, maintaining equilibrium. That gives all of us... discipline. But let\u0027s just say somewhere in the depths of one of the Watches a plan is being hatched for ultimate victory. A group of battle magicians who have come together and are capable of killing all the Inquisitors in a single night¡ªthat is, of course, if they happen to know all about the Inquisition¡ªwho serves in it, where they live, where they keep their documents...\"\\n\\n \"Did the letter arrive at their head office?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Yes. And judging from the fact that six hours later the office was empty, and there was a fire in the building, that must have been where the Inquisition kept all its archives. Even I didn\u0027t know that for certain. Anyway, by sending the letter to the Inquisition, this person... or Other... has thrown down the gauntlet to them. Now the Inquisition will be after him. The official reason is that security has been breached and an attempt is being made to initiate a human being. But in reality, what\u0027s driving them is concern for their own skin.\"\\n\\n \"I never thought it was like them to feel afraid for themselves,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Oh yes, and how, Anton! Here\u0027s a little something for you to ponder... Why aren\u0027t there any traitors in the Inquisition? Dark Ones and Light Ones join them. They go through their training. And then¡ªthe Dark Ones punish Dark Ones severely, the Light Ones punish Light Ones, the very moment they violate the Treaty.\"\\n\\n \"A special character type,\" I suggested. \"They select Others who are like that.\"\\n\\n \"And they never make a mistake?\" Gesar asked skeptically. \"That couldn\u0027t happen. But in the whole of history, there has never been a single case of an Inquisitor violating the Treaty...\"\\n\\n \"They evidently understand too clearly what violating the Treaty leads to. There was one Inquisitor in Prague who told me, \u0027We are constrained by fear.\u0027\"\\n\\n Gesar frowned. \"Witezslav... he\u0027s fond of fine phrases... All right, don\u0027t bother your head about that. The situation\u0027s simple¡ªthere\u0027s an Other who is either in violation of the Treaty or taunting the Watches and the Inquisition. The Inquisition will conduct its investigation, the Dark Ones will conduct theirs. And a staff member is required from us too.\"\\n\\n \"May I ask why me in particular?\"\\n\\n Gesar spread his hands expressively again. \"For a number of reasons. The first is that in the course of the investigation you\u0027ll probably come up against vampires. And you\u0027re our top specialist on the lower Dark Ones.\"\\n\\n No, he didn\u0027t seem to be making fun of me.\\n\\n \"The second reason,\" Gesar went on, opening the fingers of his fist as he counted, in the German fashion, \"is that the investigators officially appointed by the Inquisition are old friends of yours. Witezslav and Edgar.\"\\n\\n \"Edgar\u0027s in Moscow?\" I asked, surprised. I couldn\u0027t say that I actually liked the Dark Magician who had transferred to the Inquisition three years earlier. But... but I could say that I didn\u0027t find him unpleasant.\\n\\n \"Yes, he is. He completed his course of training four months ago and flew back here. Since this job means you\u0027ll be in contact with Inquisitors, any previous personal acquaintance is useful.\"\\n\\n \"My acquaintance with them wasn\u0027t all that enjoyable,\" I reminded him.\\n\\n \"What do you think I\u0027m promising you here, Thai massage during working hours?\" Gesar asked cantankerously. \"The third reason why I particularly wanted to give this assignment to you is...\" He stopped.\\n\\n I waited.\\n\\n \"The Dark Ones\u0027 investigation is also being conducted by an old acquaintance of yours.\"\\n\\n Gesar didn\u0027t need to go on and mention the name. But he did anyway.\\n\\n \"Konstantin. The young vampire... your former neighbor. I recall that you used to be on good terms.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course,\" I said bitterly. \"When he was still a child, only drank pig\u0027s blood, and dreamed of escaping from the \u0027curse\u0027...\\n\\n Until he realized that his friend the Light Magician burns his kind to ashes.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s life,\" said Gesar.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s already drunk human blood,\" I said. \"He must have! If he\u0027s in favor in the Day Watch.\"\\n\\n \"He has become a Higher Vampire,\" Gesar declared. \"The youngest Higher Vampire in Europe. If you translate that into our terms, that means...\"\\n\\n \"Third or fourth level of Power,\" I whispered. \"Five or six lives destroyed.\"\\n\\n Kostya, Kostya... I was a young, inexperienced Light Magician back then. I just couldn\u0027t make any friends in the Watch, and relations with all my old friends were rapidly falling apart... Others and people can\u0027t be friends... and suddenly I discovered that my neighbors on the same staircase were Dark Others. A family of vampires. The mother and father were vampires, and they\u0027d initiated their child, too. There was nothing really sinister about them though. No nocturnal hunting, no applications for licenses, they respected the law and drank pig\u0027s blood and donors\u0027 blood. And so, like a fool, I let my defenses down. I became friends with them. I even used to go around to see them. I even invited them to my place. They ate food that I\u0027d cooked, and praised it... and, fool that I was, I didn\u0027t realize that human food is tasteless to them, that they are tormented by an ancient, eternal hunger. The little vampire kid even decided that he was going to be a biologist and discover a cure for vampirism...\\n\\n Then I killed my first vampire.\\n\\n After that Kostya joined the Day Watch. I didn\u0027t know if he\u0027d ever graduated from his biology faculty, but he\u0027d certainly shed his childhood illusions...\\n\\n He\u0027d started receiving licenses to kill. Rise to the level of a Higher Vampire in three years? He must have had help. All the resources of the Day Watch must have been brought to bear so that the nice young guy Kostya could sink his fangs into human necks over and over again...\\n\\n And I had a pretty good idea who had helped him.\\n\\n \"What do you think, Anton,\" said Gesar, \"in the given situation, who should we appoint as the investigator from our side?\"\\n\\n I took my cell phone out of my pocket and dialed Svetlana\u0027s number. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-watch-watch-3/page-2.html","bookId":2537,"book":{"id":2537,"title":"Twilight Watch (Watch #3)","description":"Storyline: Twilight Watch (Watch, #3) \\n Twilight Watch (sometimes translated Dusk Watch) (Russian: Sumerechniy Dozor, Сумеречный Дозор) is a fantasy novel by Russian writer Sergey Lukyanenko.

Each story begins with a prologue followed by seven numbered chapters and concluding with an Epilogue. Except for the prologues, the events of each story are written in a first person narrative using the voice of the Light Magician character Anton Gorodetsky, a member of Night Watch. Events in each of the prologues are written in a third person narrative and take place entirely outside of Gordetsky\u0027s presence. The entire novel is written in the past tense.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/twilight-watch-watch-3.jpg","author":"Sergei Lukyanenko","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-watch-watch-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:51 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:06 PM"}}
