Svetlana winced painfully. Sooner or later all Others are obliged to manipulate their relatives\u0027 memories. And there\u0027s nothing pleasant about that. Of course, we do have a choice. We could reveal the truth¡ª or part of the truth¡ªto our nearest and dearest. But that doesn\u0027t produce very good results either. \"Good night, little daughter,\" said Svetlana. \"Off you go, go on,\" my mother-in-law sniffed. \"You\u0027ve worn my little girl out, exhausted her, the poor sweetheart...\" We left the room and Svetlana closed the door firmly. It was quiet. The only sound was the pendulum clock creaking on the wall. \"All that namby-pamby talk,\" I said. \"You can\u0027t treat a child like that...\" \"A girl you can,\" Svetlana said, dismissing my opinion. \"And especially if she\u0027s only three. Anton... let\u0027s go into the garden.\" \"The garden, all right, the garden it is,\" I agreed cheerfully. \"Let\u0027s go.\" We both walked over to the hammock and sat down beside each other. I could feel Svetlana trying to pull away, hard as that is to do in a hammock. \"Start from the very beginning,\" I advised her. \"From the beginning...\" Svetlana sighed. \"From the beginning... that\u0027s not possible. Everything\u0027s too tangled up.\" \"Then explain why you let the witch go.\" \"She knows too much, Anton. And if there\u0027s a trial... if it all comes out...\" \"But she\u0027s a criminal!\" \"Arina didn\u0027t do anything bad to us,\" Svetlana said in a quiet voice, as if she were trying to convince herself. \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027s bloodthirsty at all. Most witches are genuinely malevolent, but there are some like that....\" \"I give up!\" I said, raising my hands in the air. \"She kept the werewolves in line, and she didn\u0027t hurt Nadya. A genuine Arina Rodionovna, she really is. And what about the disruption of the experiment?\" \"She explained that.\" \"What did she explain? That almost a hundred years of Russian history was flushed down the tubes? That instead of a normal society, a bureaucratic dictatorship was built... with all the consequences that flow from that?\" \"You heard what she said¡ªthat would have meant people finding out about us.\" I gave a deep sigh and tried to collect my thoughts. \"Sveta... think what you\u0027re saying. Five years ago you were a human being yourself. We still are human... only we\u0027re more advanced. Like a new twist in the spiral of evolution. If people had found out, it wouldn\u0027t have mattered!\" \"We\u0027re not more advanced,\" Svetlana said with a shake of her head. \"Anton, when you called me... I guessed that the witch would be watching the Twilight, so I jumped straight to the fifth level. Apart from Gesar and Olga, I don\u0027t think any of our Light Ones have ever been there...\" She stopped. And I realized this was what Svetlana wanted to talk about. Something that was truly terrible. \"What\u0027s down there, Sveta?\" I whispered. \"I was there for quite a long time,\" Svetlana went on. \"And anyway... I realized a few things. Just how doesn\u0027t matter right now.\" \"And?\" \"Everything it says in the witch\u0027s book is right, Anton. We\u0027re not genuine magicians. We don\u0027t have greater abilities than ordinary people. We\u0027re exactly like the blue moss at the first level of the Twilight. Remember that example from the book about body temperature and the temperature of the surroundings? Well then, all people have a magical temperature of 97.7¡℮ Some who are very lucky, or unlucky, have a fever¡ªtheir temperature is higher. And all that energy, all that Power, warms the world. Our body temperature is below the norm. We absorb Power that isn\u0027t ours and we can redistribute it. We\u0027re parasites. A weak Other like Igor has a temperature of ninety-three. Yours is, say, sixty-eight. Mine is fifty.\" I had my answer ready. I\u0027d already thought about this, just as soon as I finished reading the book. \"But so what, Sveta? What of it? People can\u0027t use their Power. We can. So what\u0027s the point?\" \"The point is that people will never come to terms with that. Even the best and the kindest always look enviously at those who have been given more. At the sportsmen, the handsome men and beautiful women, the geniuses and the ones with talent. But they can\u0027t complain about it... it\u0027s fate, chance. But now imagine that you\u0027re an ordinary human being. Perfectly ordinary. And suddenly you discover that some people live for hundreds of years, can predict the future, heal diseases, and put a hex on you. Quite seriously, all for real. And all at your expense. We\u0027re parasites, Anton. Exactly like the vampires. Exactly like the blue moss. If that gets out, if they invent some new instrument that can distinguish Others from normal people, they\u0027ll start hunting us and exterminating us. And if we band together and create our own state, they\u0027ll drop atom bombs on us.\" \"Divide and protect...\" I whispered, citing the Night Watch\u0027s main catchword. \"That\u0027s right. Divide and protect, not people from Dark Ones, but people from Others in general.\" I laughed. I looked up into the night sky and laughed, remembering myself when I was a little younger, walking along a dark street to a rendezvous with vampires. With a passionate heart, clean hands, and a cool, empty head... \"We\u0027ve talked so many times about what the difference is between us and the Dark Ones...\" Svetlana said in a low voice. \"I\u0027ve found one way of putting it. We\u0027re good shepherds. We watch over the flock. And I suppose that means a lot. Only we mustn\u0027t deceive ourselves or anyone else. There\u0027ll never be a time when all people become Others. We\u0027ll never reveal ourselves to them. And we\u0027ll never allow people to build a more or less decent society. Capitalism, communism... that\u0027s not the point. The only world that will ever suit us is one in which people are preoccupied with the size of the trough and the quality of hay. Because the moment they lift their heads out of the trough, look around and see us, we\u0027ll be finished.\" I looked up into the sky and toyed with Svetlana\u0027s hand, lying there on my knees. Just a hand, warm and limp... and only a short while ago it had been raining down bolts of lightning on the witch who had sabotaged Russia... The limp hand of a Great Enchantress, who had only half as much magic in her as I did. \"And there\u0027s nothing to be done,\" Svetlana whispered. \"The Watches won\u0027t let the ordinary people out of the cattle-shed. In the States there\u0027ll be huge feeding troughs that make you want to dive in over your head. Somewhere over in Uruguay, there\u0027ll be sparse grass on the mountain pastures, so people have no time to look up at the sky. The only thing we can do is choose the prettiest cattle-shed and paint it a nice bright color.\" \"What if you tell the Others all this?\" \"It won\u0027t bother the Dark Ones at all. And the Light Ones will come to terms with it. I learned a truth I didn\u0027t want to know, Anton¡ªand I\u0027ve come to terms with it. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t have told you? But that would have been dishonest. As if you were part of the herd too.\" \"Sveta...\" I looked at the faint reflection of the night-light in the window. \"Sveta, then what\u0027s Nadiushka\u0027s magical temperature?\" She hesitated before she answered. \"Zero.\" \"The Greatest of all the Great...\" I said. \"Absolutely no magic in her at all...\" said Svetlana. \"So now what do we do?\" \"Carry on living,\" Svetlana said simply. \"I\u0027m an Other... it\u0027s too late now to pretend to be innocent. I take Power from people or I draw it from the Twilight¡ªeither way, it\u0027s not my Power. But I\u0027m not to blame for that.\" \"Sveta, I\u0027m going to Gesar. Right now. I\u0027m leaving the Watch.\" \"I know. Go.\" I got up and steadied the swaying hammock. It was dark, and I couldn\u0027t see Svetlana\u0027s face. \"Go, Anton,\" she repeated. \"It\u0027s going to be hard for us to look into each other\u0027s eyes. We need time to get used to it.\" \"What\u0027s down there, on the fifth level?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s best if you don\u0027t know.\" \"All right. I\u0027ll ask Gesar.\" \"Let him tell you... if he wants to.\" I leaned down and touched her cheek¡ªit was wet with tears. \"It\u0027s disgusting...\" she whispered. \"Disgusting... to be a parasite.\" \"Hang in here...\" \"I am.\" When I went into the barn, I heard a door close¡ªSvetlana had gone back into the house. Without bothering to switch on the light, I got into the car and pulled the door shut. Right then, what had Uncle Kolya done with it? Should I start it or shouldn\u0027t I? The car started the first time and the diesel engine began purring very quietly. I switched on the low beams and drove out of the barn. What about the rules of concealment? To hell with them. Why should the shepherd hide from the flock? I opened the gates with a brief wave of my hand, without getting out of the car. I drove out into the street and stepped on the gas right away. The village looked empty and lifeless. Someone had sprinkled sleeping pills in the sheep\u0027s feed. The car tore out onto the country road. I switched to high beams and put my foot down. The wind rushed in through the open window. I felt for the remote control on the steering wheel and switched on the disk player. I entered this windy city without a cloak. And it wound around my throat just like ivy. The serpent\u0027s coils fettered my soul. I see a black sun, beneath which I shall never shed a tear. I am slipping out of character. I am insolent, unfair. What can a rabbit hope for in a boa constrictor\u0027s throat? The serpent\u0027s coils only feel tight at first, I see a black sun, and dreams the same color, I cannot tell sins from virtues, even to save my life. They\u0027re removing the witnesses, turning us to snakes. And I am willing to rot under any flag, Prepared to slither, zigzagging across the ground, And even sing of love, up to my throat in vomit, If that is what my Motherland requires. A light appeared up ahead, somewhere near the access road onto the highway. I screwed up my eyes and looked through the Twilight. There was a temporary militia barrier across the road. And two men waiting beside it, with two Others. Dark Others. I smiled and slowed down. My brain is a beehive with ants instead of bees. The bullet\u0027s center of gravity is displaced toward love. But the serpent\u0027s coils are armor plating. I see a black sun. A sun that hates me. I could have surrendered without a fight, caught in the devil\u0027s jaws. But I\u0027ll die on my feet¡ªthe coils will not let me fall. The serpent\u0027s coils¡ªmy brace and my shell. I see a black sun. And it hurts my eyes. I stopped right in front of the barrier and waited for the highway patrolman holding an automatic rifle to his chest. The Inquisition was never too choosy when it came to recruiting people for security cordons. I handed the militiaman my license and documents for the car, and turned the sound down. I looked at the Others. The first was an Inquisitor I didn\u0027t know¡ªa lean, elderly Asiatic type. I\u0027d have said he was at the second or third level of Power, but with Inquisitors it\u0027s always harder to tell. The second was a Dark One I knew very well, from the Moscow Day Watch. The vampire Kostya. \"We\u0027re looking for a witch,\" said the Inquisitor. The militiamen took no notice of the Others. The militiamen had been ordered not to see. \"Arina\u0027s not here,\" I replied. \"Is Edgar in charge of the dragnet?\" The Inquisitor nodded. \"Ask him about me. Anton Gorodetsky, Night Watch.\" \"I know him,\" Kostya said casually, leaning down toward the Inquisitor. \"A law-abiding Light One...\" \"Proceed,\" said the highway patrolman, handing back my documents. \"You can drive on,\" the Inquisitor said with a nod. \"There\u0027ll be more security posts down the road.\" I nodded and drove out onto the highway. Kostya stood there, watching me drive away. I switched the sound back on. I\u0027m not for or against. I\u0027m not good or evil. You\u0027ve been damned lucky with me, my Motherland. Your serpent\u0027s coils are my home, my trap. I shall crawl under the sun. Under this cursed sun, From here to here, and then from here to here, From here to Judgment Day.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-watch-watch-3/page-18.html","bookId":2537,"book":{"id":2537,"title":"Twilight Watch (Watch #3)","description":"Storyline: Twilight Watch (Watch, #3) Twilight Watch (sometimes translated Dusk Watch) (Russian: Sumerechniy Dozor, Сумеречный Дозор) is a fantasy novel by Russian writer Sergey Lukyanenko. It is the sequel to The Night Watch and Day Watch and the third part of tetralogy that concludes with Final Watch. Lukyanenko returns to a structure closer to that he used in the Night Watch novel than the Day Watch novel. Twilight Watch is divided into three stories- Nobody\u0027s Time, Nobody\u0027s Space, and Nobody\u0027s Power. Each story begins with a prologue followed by seven numbered chapters and concluding with an Epilogue. Except for the prologues, the events of each story are written in a first person narrative using the voice of the Light Magician character Anton Gorodetsky, a member of Night Watch. Events in each of the prologues are written in a third person narrative and take place entirely outside of Gordetsky\u0027s presence. The entire novel is written in the past tense.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/twilight-watch-watch-3.jpg","author":"Sergei Lukyanenko","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-watch-watch-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:51 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:06 PM"}}
