{"id":101637,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Our unspoken truce lasted through dinner, during which I watched with fascination while Christian did not eat his food.\n \"How do you do that?\" I asked when I looked up to find yet another bit of his prawns gone.\n He smiled. \"The hand is quicker than the eye.\"\n \"Oh. You\u0027ve never been able to eat?\"\n \"Food? No.\"\n I thought about that for a minute while I ate some lemon-roasted chicken. \"How exactly did you end up\" - I looked around us - \"as you are? Were you born that way or did someone turn you?\"\n His long fingers toyed with the rim of his wineglass. \"There are two types of Dark Ones: those who were born to it, and those who were created. I am in the former group.\"\n \"Really? So your parents were vamps, too?\"\n He nodded. \"All males born of an unredeemed Dark One are the same as their father.\"\n Something didn\u0027t sit right. \"Wait a minute, you said that when you guys find your Beloveds, they save you and redeem your soul, right? So how can an unredeemed Dark One have children?\"\n \"The same way any other man does,\" he said with more than a hint of a grin. \"There are many of my kind who never find their Beloveds, but that does not mean they do not take solace where they can in relationships with mortal women.\"\n \"Oh.\" Which, of course, made me want to ask, \"So do you do that too? Take solace, I mean?\"\n His eyelids dropped until he was giving me a look so steamy it could have cooked carrots. \"Are you inquiring for general knowledge, or is there a purpose to your question?\"\n I made an attempt to stifle the parts of my body that were responding (with much enthusiasm) to the effect of that smooth, beautiful voice, not to mention his bedroom eyes. It wasn\u0027t easy, but finally I could look back up to him and speak without grabbing his head and kissing the dickens out of him. \"Let\u0027s just say it\u0027s general curiosity.\"\n His eyes darkened to a deep walnut. \"Why do you do that?\"\n I blinked and tried to summon my innocent face. \"Do what?\"\n \"Struggle against the attraction you feel for me. I feel the same and yet I do not struggle; it would be pointless. It is not something one can control - it either is, or it isn\u0027t. Yet you deny the passion that beats so strongly within you, I can sense its presence even when I am not near you. Are you so threatened by me that you cannot stand the thought of physical intimacy?\"\n \"I\u0027m not threatened by you,\" I said in a low whisper, not wanting our conversation to reach the ears of others. \"And I\u0027m not passionate.\"\n He laughed a smooth, seductive sort of laugh that felt like velvet touching my skin. \"Maly v¨¢le¨¨n¨ªk, you are.\"\n \"I am not. I\u0027ve been told often enough that I lack any sort of connubial warmth to disbelieve you. In fact, the words cold fish were used at one point. And what did you call me?\"\n He ignored my question. \"Was it your ex-husband who told you this?\"\n I shifted in my seat and wondered how he could know I was struggling with myself not to respond to him. I had a very tight control over my mind; not even Christian\u0027s probes had been able to penetrate my guards. \"Well... yes, but I know for a fact it\u0027s true. I\u0027m neither a virgin nor a prude, Christian. I\u0027m thirty-one years old. I have been with men. I know I\u0027m lacking the passion other women have because I\u0027ve never particularly enjoyed sexual acts, and from the dissatisfied looks on my partners\u0027 faces, the feeling was obviously mutual. So you needn\u0027t bother trying to seduce me in order to gain a little solace. You won\u0027t find it in my arms.\"\n \"No? Let us test that theory, shall we?\" He held out his hand for me. \"Come here.\"\n I stared at his hand like it was made up of boiled spiders. \"What?\"\n \"Come here. Sit next to me.\"\n I looked around us. Although we were in a rather secluded spot in the restaurant, our table was clearly visible to at least a half dozen people. \"No! People will see us!\"\n One sable eyebrow rose. \"Does that thought arouse you?\"\n I frowned down my nose at him. \"Not in the least.\"\n He sighed. \"I can see I will have much to teach you. Come here, Allegra. Sit next to me. Prove to me that you are a cold fish.\"\n \"I am not going to fall for such a weak example of reverse psychology,\" I told him with an annoyed roll of my eyes.\n \"Ah, so you are too afraid of me to prove what you say?\"\n \"I\u0027m not afraid of you,\" I answered. \"I don\u0027t have to prove anything.\"\n He made an elegant gesture that spoke volumes - volumes about him proving his point, and me being too chicken to correct him.\n \"All right,\" I snarled, standing up as I threw down my napkin. I walked over to his side of the table and plopped myself down in his lap, ignoring at least five pairs of eyes that I could feel on my back. \"You want me to prove that I\u0027m passionless, I\u0027ll prove to you that I\u0027m passionless. Be prepared to be bored to tears.\"\n I clamped my hands onto his shoulders, mashing my mouth up against his, purposely grinding my lips hard against his teeth. He tolerated that for a moment, then gently cupped either side of my jaw and tipped my head back at a different angle. \"We will try this again, but without the show of brute strength, yes?\"\n I looked into his eyes and knew I was in trouble, serious, deep, fathomless trouble. His eyes were dark wells of desire - a desire for me, something I\u0027d never seen in a man\u0027s eyes. I felt myself falling into them as his lips teased mine, feathering soft little kisses along the length of my mouth, tantalizing me until I could no longer deny the truth.\n I wanted him to touch me. I wanted him to kiss me. I wanted to taste him again, to have him taste me. I fought a desperate fight to maintain control over my desire, but the first stroke of his tongue against my lips tolled a death knell for my good intentions. My lips softened on his. I allowed him to surge into my mouth, and with that intimate touch the last of my barriers were destroyed. I moaned into his mouth as his tongue become more aggressive, stroking mine, demanding, not asking for response. I slid my hands into his hair, pulling the leather thong that bound it free so that his hair hung loose to his shoulders. The satiny length of it poured over my fingers like cool water, making me shiver in response.\n I felt his touch in my mind, felt the whispers around the edges of my guards, and was overwhelmed with a curiosity to know what he was thinking. It was the sheerest folly to allow myself to receive his thoughts, for I knew he would be able to receive mine as well, but the fire that flamed within me at his touch was too strong to be quenched. He deepened the kiss as I opened my mind to his, allowing the sensations he was feeling to join with mine. His thoughts were wordless, formless images of pleasure, of need and desire and a desperate hope that were bound together until it was impossible to separate them. I responded to the need, knowing I shouldn\u0027t, knowing it would lead to disaster, but unable to keep from taking his darkness within myself and returning it with all the light I had.\n His power surrounded us, permeated us, bound us together in a manner I did not understand, or even wish to examine. Rather than be stifled by it, I gloried in it, allowing his power to blend with mine just as our thoughts merged. His arousal fed mine; my desire fired his to greater heights. His tongue was everywhere in my mouth; then mine was in his, tasting him, learning him, aching for something that I couldn\u0027t quite reach.\n This is not the way of a cold fish, maly v¨¢le¨¨n¨ªk, the thought echoed in my head.\n I sucked his lower lip into my mouth, nibbled on it for a bit, then slowly pulled my mouth from his.\n What does maly v¨¢le¨¨n¨ªk mean exactly?\n I could feel the smile in his thoughts. Little warrior.\n Warrior, hmm? I could live with that. What worried me was the ease with which he settled into my mind. Slowly, gently, I shut him out, replacing my mental guards. I was shaken, more shaken than I wanted to admit even to myself at just how tempting it was to throw down my guards altogether, but as I stared down into Christian\u0027s midnight eyes, I reminded myself that even if he was immortal, he was still a man. I couldn\u0027t risk trusting him with that sort of power over me.\n I pushed myself off his lap and stumbled back to my chair, reaching with a lamentably shaky hand for the water glass.\n \"So\" - I cleared my throat to try to lower the level of huskiness his kiss had generated - \"what do you know about this medium Guarda White? One of the SIP people mentioned her. I\u0027m curious as to how you know about her.\"\n Christian touched a finger to his lush lower lip. \"You will not concede defeat?\"\n I picked up my fork and speared a chunk of chive-roasted potato. \"I wasn\u0027t aware we were engaged in battle.\"\n He smiled and inclined his head. \"Touch¨¦. It was not a battle, merely\" - his gaze dropped to my lips. Instinctively I licked them. They felt sensitive and tender, as if they were swollen - \"an experiment with a most interesting outcome. I begin to think I have been overly hasty in my conclusions.\"\n My entire body went up in flames at the longing in his eyes. I tried desperately to gather the shreds of my control around me. \"Please, Christian...\"\n He ignored my whispered plea, taking my hand in his, his thumb stroking circles on the back of my hand. \"Why do you struggle so? Why do you fight to wrap shields of indifference around yourself when I can feel within you all the ardor you stir within me? Why do you deny the passion that fills you at my touch?\"\n I pulled my hand from his slowly and tucked it away in my lap. Unreasonably, I felt close to tears, but didn\u0027t know if was for him I wanted to weep, or me. \"I\u0027m sorry, Christian,\" I told the remains of my chicken. \"I just can\u0027t allow any man to have that sort of power over me.\"\n Christian was silent for a time, a long enough time that I finally had to look up at him. His eyes, always an indicator of what he was feeling, glistened brightly in the glow of the candle on the table. His voice was low, pitched only for my ears, and skimmed along me like a pair of lover\u0027s hands. \"It will be my distinct pleasure to show you that not all men use power to inflict punishment.\" I said nothing. There was just nothing to say.\n The theater rented by the Association of Research Mediums and Psychics Investigation Trust (known by the dubious acronym ARMPIT) for their cattle call of psychic talent was a small, intimate space located in the basement of an old building that looked to date back to the late eighteenth century.\n \"According to this,\" I read out of the pamphlet that had been shoved into my hands as we entered the theater, \"Guarda White and someone called Eduardo Tassalerro, head of Milan Psychics, Limited, are forming a sort of brain tank of psychics \u0027in order to further knowledge of spirits, and spectral activity in Britain today.\u0027 Hmm. I wonder what they think they can do that we in UPRA can\u0027t do.\"\n \"UPRA?\"\n \"It\u0027s the organization I work for. The sister organization in England is the SIP, both of which are more than fully capable of furthering knowledge about spirits and such.\"\n \"Perhaps the brain tank has another purpose?\"\n I slid a glance at Christian. It wasn\u0027t what he said so much as how he said it - with a sense of controlled excitement that even in my guarded state I could feel. I wondered idly if some of his mind was leaking into mine.\n That was all I needed, a man so handsome he made my bones melt and my blood boil with just a look slipping in and out of my mind whenever he wanted. I glanced at Christian again. His head was tipped as he read the pamphlet, his long hair once again tied back. He was wearing a suit tonight, midnight blue with some sort of shadowy pattern woven into the cloth. The cream shirt and dark tie were common enough, but the vest he wore was a work of art. It was a deep sapphire satin that rippled and moved with each breath he took, embroidered with tiny, detailed silver stitching that traced out great birds of prey, eagles and falcons in full flight, heads thrown back and claws extended. It was beautiful and chilling at the same time, and I wanted badly to tell him how much I admired it on him, particularly how it hugged the contours of his chest, but his ego was inflated enough. The man certainly didn\u0027t need to be told he was just about the sexiest thing on the face of the earth.\n Christian smiled lazily at the pamphlet. I dragged my gaze back to my own, chewing on my lip and wondering if it was just a coincidence. What was I thinking; of course it was! My guards were solid. I\u0027d had almost thirty years to perfect them.\n Which didn\u0027t explain the fact that Christian\u0027s smile grew.\n I wrestled my mind away from the fascinating topic of the man whose leg was pressed nonchalantly against mine, and back to the theater. Carlos was up in the front row with two women I recognized from SIP, one of whom was the director. The theater was about half-full, most of the people wearing badges with local ghost-hunting groups\u0027 names emblazoned on them. A few people had laptops set up and were typing fast and furious; others wore that peculiar geeky look that dedicated paranormalists often had. I fretted with a bobble and wondered if I looked just as geeky as they did.\n \"Good evening, esteemed colleagues, dedicated researchers, ladies and gentlemen.\" The woman standing in front of the curtains had a clipped, faintly Germanic accent that matched her short silver-touched blond hair and no-nonsense build. She looked every inch a hausfrau, but the aura of power she exuded was anything but normal. \"I am Guarda White, the president of the Association of Research Mediums and Psychics Investigation Trust. I welcome you to this our sixth of eight trials to be held in the London area. For those of you who are new to the trials, we will take volunteers from the audience who wish to participate in a group Summoning, often referred to in lay terms as a s¨¦ance. Those members who we feel show a particular gift for the paranormal will be invited to join the trust. My associate, Eduardo Tassalerro of Milan Psychics, Limited, noted physical medium, will join us at the table. Will we require ten more volunteers. If you wish to be considered, please raise your hand and one of the attendants will take down your name and particulars.\"\n The curtain behind Guarda opened to display a large round table surrounded with twelve chairs. The lights on the stage were subdued, limited to a single spotlight. I wondered why anyone would want to perform on the stage for a group they knew nothing about when they could join any one of a number of legitimate research groups. I turned to whisper my question to Christian, only to find him with his arm in the air.\n \"What do you think you\u0027re doing? You\u0027re a vampire; you can\u0027t Summon ghosts!\"\n \"True, but you can.\"\n \"Me?\" I looked around us and saw with horror that a young woman in a tight miniskirt was beetling straight for Christian. I had the worst urge to put my hand on his leg, just to let her know he was taken...\n \"Drat,\" I snarled at myself.\n \"Is something the matter, Allegra?\"\n Oh, yes, something was the matter. Christian was not mine; I did not claim him. I forced my snarling lips into what I prayed looked like a cheerful, \"casual acquaintance minding my own business, not in the least bit interested in the man next to me\" sort of smile.\n Christian\u0027s lips quirked as he dropped his free arm over my shoulders.\n \"You wish to volunteer?\" the miniskirted hussy asked breathlessly, her eyes all but devouring him. I stopped trying to shrug his arm off my shoulder and wondered how bad raising a minor demon could be.\n \"Alas, I do not have the skills that are required to sit successfully in a Summoning circle, but my companion does. She is very interested in the trust and would be delighted if it were possible for her to be one of the chosen ten.\"\n I glared at him and decided two demons were in order.\n The woman glanced quickly at me, her brow fur-rowed in doubt. \"I can\u0027t guarantee that your friend will be chosen. Mrs. White reviews all of the information and makes all of the decisions about who is to sit with her.\"\n Christian\u0027s voice - always beautiful and velvety smooth - achieved a new level of polish that made his words so slick they positively skated off his tongue (and I\u0027m ashamed to admit that a tiny little fire started in my groin at the thought of that tongue). \"Is there nothing you can do to ensure that my companion will be chosen? I assure you she is more than worthy of that honor.\"\n The woman\u0027s brow smoothed out under the close-range influence of his words. She nodded vehemently. \"I\u0027ll do what I can.\"\n She quickly took down my name, occupation (I just told her I worked for UPRA), and a brief sketch of my experience.\n \"You are all that is gracious,\" Christian said with a smile so bright it made me want to offer the young woman my sunglasses. She staggered off with a sun-struck look on her face.\n \"Okay, Mr. Persuasion, now you can tell me just what you\u0027re up to. Why do you want me in that circle so badly?\"\n His brows rose in a protest of innocence. \"What makes you think I have a reason for you to join the demonstration?\"\n A group of four chattering twenty-somethings sat down behind us. I lowered my voice. \"Call it a hunch. You of all people don\u0027t want more attention on the realm of the paranormal - I\u0027m sure it\u0027s only a short hop from proof of the existence of ghosts to great hordes of men with torches racing through the countryside armed with stakes and necklaces of garlic. Come on, Blacula, dish.\"\n He got that martyred look on his face again.\n \"You know, there\u0027s nothing you can do to make me go up there if I don\u0027t want to,\" I pointed out to him in a whisper. \"If you want my help with something, you\u0027re going to have to spill it first. By the looks of things, you have about ten minutes before they start calling people up. You can either hem and haw and delay until it\u0027s too late, or you can tell me now and give me as much time to prepare as possible. The choice is yours.\"\n Christian sighed, tightening his arm on my shoulder. I fought between the unhealthy desire to snuggle into him, and the unwelcome knowledge that I should stop him before he got the wrong idea. \"It is, perhaps, inevitable that you should learn of my suspicions. You would find out in the next day or so anyway.\"\n \"Really?\" I gnawed my lip as I looked at him. \"Why?\"\n The look he gave me could have cooked cement before it cooled down into something dark and troubled. \"Three months ago a friend of mine, Sebastian, a Moravian like myself, disappeared from his home in Nice. After a month when he did not answer any of my calls, I became worried and ventured out to determine whether he had felt the need to leave Europe in haste, or if something unthinkable had happened to him.\"\n \"Unthinkable?\" Two of the ARMPIT assistants swooped down on the group of four behind us. I leaned into Christian so they wouldn\u0027t see my hand (that\u0027s my excuse, and I\u0027m sticking to it) as I mimed a stake through his heart. \"You mean that kind of unthinkable?\"\n He grimaced, and captured my stake-stabbing fingers in his free hand, absently stroking his thumb over my fingers as he spoke. \"You are an unusually bloodthirsty woman. Oddly enough, I find that to be one of your charms. There are other ways to kill a Dark One, but yes, I was concerned that some fatality had befallen him. Sebastian was not the type to go off on his own without alerting me or another of our kind as to his destination. I tracked him first to Paris, then to London, then to a small house just outside London.\"\n \"Don\u0027t tell me - Guarda White and Signor Tassa-whatever were at the house.\"\n He looked thoughtful. \"No, but it was leased by Mrs. White\u0027s trust.\"\n He was silent for a few minutes until I nudged him with my elbow. \"So? Was Sebastian there or not?\"\n The ARMPITs moved off. Christian\u0027s finger stopped rubbing circles on the back of my hand. \"He had been there. He left a message for me, a message that indicated he was being held prisoner and had little hope of gathering enough strength to escape.\"\n \"A message? What sort of a message?\"\n His mouth looked grim. I chanced a glance up to his eyes and quickly looked away. I hoped that whatever else happened in my life, Christian never had cause to look at me like that. \"It was a message written in the manner of the Dark Ones.\"\n I swallowed back a lump. \"A message written in blood?\"\n He nodded. \"Protected to keep it from the eyes of everyone but the person for whom it was intended. In this instance, me. Sebastian knew I would search for him once I realized he was missing, and although he was weak and had little strength, he used up a precious amount of his blood to leave me the message.\"\n I thought about that for a minute as I watched the last few stragglers meet up with the assistants. People throughout the theater were talking in low, hushed voices that echoed like soft little brushes of a bird\u0027s wing against the high ceiling. \"Urn, I may regret asking this, but I\u0027ve felt the power that flows through you. How do you hold a Dark One prisoner against his will?\"\n His eyes turned a flat, lifeless black. \"There are ways.\"\n I shivered at the bleakness of his voice and decided not to pursue that particular avenue of thought. \"Okay, so you think that Guarda and Eduardo are holding Sebastian prisoner somewhere, and you\u0027d like me to get chummy with them so I can find out where. What makes you think I\u0027m the least bit inclined to help you?\"\n His eyes positively caressed my face. My body melted at that look. \"I have few resources available to me here. It was my hope that I could appeal to your curiosity and your desire to help those who are unable to help themselves.\"\n I raised my chin. \"That sounds like quite a different description than independent, stubborn, and lacking in self-confidence. Give me one good reason why I should help you.\"\n His eyes never wavered from mine. \"Because I am asking you most humbly for your assistance in locating my friend.\"\n My innards melted even more at the sincerity and hope in his voice. I told my guts to get a grip on themselves and thought about it. Helping Christian wasn\u0027t in my game plan. I had only three weeks in London, and already five days had passed. If I got involved in this weird trust thing, it would severely cut into my time trying to Summon more ghosts. On the other hand, it would be good research to present to UPRA, and might go far toward keeping me employed. I glanced at Christian as I gnawed on my lip and, with an internal sigh, admitted the truth that it wasn\u0027t for job security, or even for Christian\u0027s helpless friend that I would accept his request; it was for him and him alone.\n \"All right, I\u0027ll help you, but I have a few conditions.\"\n He rolled his eyes. \"Why did I know there would be conditions?\"\n I grinned at him. \"Because you\u0027re a bright boy, despite all that macho posturing. Condition one: You have to lighten up a bit. No more of this ordering me around. I don\u0027t take orders, I consider requests.\"\n His martyred look returned; his jaw was so tight it didn\u0027t seem to want to move when he spoke. \"It will be difficult, what you ask, but I will make an effort to temper my natural tendency to express my desires in the form of orders. Will that suffice?\"\n \"Barely, but I\u0027ll accept it. Condition number two: No more wisecracks about my clothes.\"\n \"Agreed.\"\n \"Condition number three - \"\n \"How many conditions are there to be?\" he interrupted.\n \"This is the last one. Condition number three: You have to stop peeking into my mind.\"\n He looked startled.\n \"Oh, don\u0027t give me that look; I can feel you hanging around the edges of my thoughts. And you smile when I think about you being - \" I stopped. He was smiling now. \"Since I know my guards are good and strong, it means you\u0027re pulling some weird Vulcan mind trick on me.\"\n \"Not Vulcan, Moravian.\"\n \"Aha! You admit it!\"\n \"I admit nothing. If there is a sympathetic connection between us, it is nothing of my doing.\"\n I looked at him suspiciously. He looked me dead in the eye. I couldn\u0027t see any signs that he was lying, and I\u0027m a pretty good judge of that. \"Well, okay,\" I said grudgingly. \"But you just make sure you stay out of my mind unless I invite you in!\"\n His thumb commenced back-of-hand rubbing. Three more people trooped down the aisle, but judging from their matching black T-shirts, they were all ARMPITs.\n \"You have to explain a few more things to me, too. For one, I don\u0027t understand why people interested in proving the existence of ghosts would keep a vampire prisoner. I mean, it\u0027s like apples and oranges.\"\n \"You are operating under the assumption that the goals of the trust are as Guarda stated. In reality, I believe it has a much more sinister purpose.\"\n \"Really? What would that be?\" I asked.\n \"Allegra Telford? You have been chosen. Would you come to the stage, please? Steve Ricks, you have been chosen; please come to the stage. Arundel Roget, please come to the stage.\"\n The list of people called to the stage continued as the miniskirted woman trotted up to Christian for a bit of praise and to shoo me toward the stage. I half expected her to beg to be petted, then decided that was too catty a comment for even me to be thinking, and surreptitiously sketched a protection ward on her as penance.\n Christian stood to let me pass, pressing my hand in a manner that more gave strength than asked for help. I gave in and squeezed his in return, more than a little reassured by the warm solidness of his presence.\n I shook off the odd sense of reliability that his touch had inspired, and followed the miniskirt to the stage, where I was handed a piece of colored chalk.\n \"No, thanks, I have my own,\" I said, pulling out the chalk that, with the dead man\u0027s ash, I\u0027d made a habit of keeping on me while I was in a city filled to the brim with historic sites, and even more historic ghosts.\n I was pointed to a chair. I walked across the stage, neck-pricklingly aware that someone was watching me intently. I glanced to the side and saw that Guarda had me in her sights as she spoke to one of her flunkies. I gave her a weak little grin and took my seat. A short, balding man with a serious perspiration problem took the seat to my left, while a young, cocky woman with a thick cap of curly blond hair sat on my right.\n \"I\u0027m Diane,\" she said, introducing herself. I shook her hand, told her my name, and turned to the man on my left.\n \"Peter Dunwich.\" He had a soggy hand, but I managed not to let him see me wipe it off on my pants. I fervently hoped Guarda wasn\u0027t the type who liked to form circles made with physical contact between the participants. Holding Peter\u0027s hand did not promise to be a pleasant experience.\n Guarda and the tall, olive-skinned man she\u0027d introduced as Eduardo joined the table. The lights clicked off in the theater, leaving only the one spotlight on us.\n \"Showtime,\" I murmured, then took a deep breath and focused my attention on calming myself and preparing for the ritual of Summoning. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-and-the-single-vampire-dark-ones-2/page-7.html","bookId":2203,"book":{"id":2203,"title":"Sex and the Single Vampire (Dark Ones #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Sex and the Single Vampire (Dark Ones, #2) \n If Allie doesn\u0027t find a ghost soon, her short career as a \"Summoner\" with United Psychical Research Association will be a thing of the past, so naturally she is delighted to find what she thinks is the tortured spirit of a gorgeous, naked, wounded man.
