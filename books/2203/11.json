{"id":101641,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"Good night, Nelly,\" I snorted as I closed the door, locking it with the key Christian had given me earlier.\n \"I beg your pardon, miss?\"\n I hurriedly slipped on my glasses and smiled at Turner, one of the two people who took care of Christian when he stayed in London. \"Nothing. Is my taxi here?\"\n He nodded and flicked away a molecule of dust that had dared to land on the banister.\n I had a feeling that Christian\u0027s servants didn\u0027t exactly approve of me, but since Christian had told me earlier that they thought the same of him, an eccentric novelist who kept odd hours, I wasn\u0027t overly worried how they viewed my sudden, sunglass-wearing appearance any more than I worried about Roxy\u0027s claim that he kept a houseful of servants to act as dinner on the hoof, so to speak.\n Christian informed me that he always ate out.\n I spent the time in the taxi mulling over just how I could get the information I wanted from Guarda without her knowing what I was up to. Of prime importance was the need to find out where Sebastian was being held, but I couldn\u0027t think of a way to go about asking that without giving everything away. I decided I\u0027d tackle the ghost that Guarda held. It made sense that wherever they were keeping the ghost was likely to be the same place that they were holding the captured Dark One.\n A ghost could be bound to a location that was not his or her original haunt in three ways: the first was to bind the ghost to a keeper and deposit the keeper in the location, the second was for a Summoner to invoke the ghost\u0027s name, and keep the Summoner prisoner (thereby trapping the spirit as well), and the third... well, the third was something I really didn\u0027t want to think about. It involved cursing the spirit to forever remain in the location. There was a way for a Summoner to Release a cursed spirit, but as it involved calling up the demon that was used to enact the curse, I had little knowledge and even less experience in that area.\n I hoped the answer was as simple as the keeper, and tried to clear my mind of all thoughts of Christian and the now five ghosts that I had sneezed up.\n Ten minutes later I was ushered into a quiet, spartan office done in neutral taupe and oatmeal tones. There was a slight tingle that heralded a ward on the door to Guarda\u0027s office as I passed through it, but as she had called out an invitation for me to step into the office, the ward allowed me to pass without slowing me down. Still, I made note that she was powerful enough to keep a ward active on a door for what must be a great length of time.\n \"Allegra, how nice to see you again.\" She rose and came around a huge desk to greet me. I held out my hand, assuming she wanted to shake it. \"Oh, would you mind if I didn\u0027t? I\u0027m so sensitive these days, and it unnerves me to touch others when I have to do a Summoning later. I mean no offense, of course.\"\n \"None taken,\" I said, more than a little surprised that she was also a Summoner. She felt to me more like a psychometrist, someone who knows things related to an object just by touching it. A Summoner who could also tell the history of an object with just a brush of her fingers was a very powerful person - perhaps that was why I was instantly wary of her. \"I\u0027ll just sit here, shall I?\"\n I sat on the taupe and muted green striped chair when she nodded, trying not to squirm when she sat on the edge of her desk and examined me closely. \"You look rested.\"\n I thought of the night I\u0027d spent doing anything but resting, then quickly pushed it from my mind. Even with my guards up, I didn\u0027t want to leave any untoward thoughts of Christian around where Guarda might pick upon them. She had gently felt around the edges of my mind twice since I\u0027d walked through the door.\n \"Thank you, I am. I feel much better, although Christian did make me promise him that I wouldn\u0027t Summon today, just to be on the safe side.\"\n She stood up and walked back around her desk, but not before I saw her eyes move quickly to a black glass etching on the wall. I opened my mind up a little and felt the presence of someone behind the wall. It was Eduardo; I was willing to bet my life on it. The hair on the back of my neck rippled uncomfortably. I hate being spied on. \"Ah, your fianc¨¦. What did you say his surname was?\" She picked up her pen and poised it over a piece of cream paper.\n I sucked on the inside of my cheek for a minute. \"I don\u0027t believe that ever came up, and to be truthful, I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027re asking now. I like to keep my private life private, Mrs. White. I\u0027m sorry you were so concerned about me last night that you were forced to come to our home, but I can assure you that I normally keep my business and personal affairs separate.\"\n She set the pen down and leaned back in an expensive leather chair dyed the same color as the muted green stripes. \"I see.\" She watched me for a minute, tapping her finger on her chin before finally coming to some decision. \"I must tell you, Miss Telford, we at the Trust take our role very seriously. No amount is spared to ensure that the research conducted under the Trust\u0027s eye is as exacting as possible. We apply the same practice to the researchers who are members of the Trust. For that reason we investigate the background of each member thoroughly before admitting them to the inner circle. You will agree, of course, that such precautions are necessary to keep out people who might have philosophies different from those that govern the Trust.\"\n \"Yes,\" I drawled, wondering how much investigation she could have done on me in just one night.\n Quite a bit, as it turned out.\n \"It is for that reason that I made sure the background check into your past was treated with the highest priority.\"\n Oh, rats. I had a sick feeling I knew what she was going to say.\n \"Our investigation revealed that your employer in the West Coast UPRA office believed that you were staying at a hotel in Mayfair. A check of that hotel provided confirmation of the fact that until eleven o\u0027clock yesterday evening, you were registered there. Despite having a reservation for the room that still had two and a half weeks to run, your account was paid up, your things were packed, and you were checked out.\"\n I tried to stay calm and not fidget, but it wasn\u0027t easy under the influence of Guarda\u0027s pale blue eyes. They both dominated and seemed to invite confidence. I couldn\u0027t decide which feeling I disliked the most.\n \"In addition, your employer informed my investigator that this was your first trip to England. I find it somewhat unlikely that you met and accepted a marriage proposal from your fianc¨¦ in the matter of a few days,\" she said mildly, but there was no mildness in her eyes. They were compelling me to reveal my innermost thoughts, something I struggled against with a rising sense of panic.\n \"Um... well, about that,\" I said, thinking quickly. \"As a matter of fact, we aren\u0027t really engaged. Not formally. But... um... Christian and I met a few days ago and we really hit it off, and, well, you know how these things can be.\"\n \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I do not. Tell me.\"\n I waved a vague hand around and tried to look mortified that my relationship with Christian was being bandied about, it wasn\u0027t too hard to do. \"It\u0027s all a bit embarrassing to admit to someone that you\u0027ve hopped into the sack with a person you\u0027ve just met, so Christian said we were engaged. That\u0027s all.\"\n \"Is it?\"\n I slapped an innocent look on my face and met her gaze without wavering.\n Much.\n \"I believe that it is not all, Allegra. I believe that there is something more you have to tell me regarding the two spirits you Summoned in the theater.\"\n Oh, poop. How did she know about Jem and Alis?\n \"Um...\"\n \"Eduardo and Steven both examined the building the theater is in from attic to basement. They could find signs of only one spirit remaining. Thus the spirits you Summoned must have either been Released, which would have taken far longer an amount of time than you had available, or...\"\n She looked at me with her icy blue eyes, demanding that I tell her the truth. Her mind gave mine a little push at the same time, which served only to tick me off. I hate it when psychics get pushy.\n \"Or what?\" I asked, feigning disinterest.\n \"Or you bound the spirits into keepers when my attention was elsewhere, and smuggled them out of the theater after you pretended to faint. Since that seems to be the most reasonable explanation, I have come to the reluctant conclusion that you have not entered into the spirit - if you will forgive the expression - of the Trust in a manner at all consistent with furthering the tenets we hold inviolate.\"\n I ignored the prickling on the back of my neck and dug up a smile. \"Well, that\u0027s one theory, yes.\"\n \"Do you have another explanation you would care to make?\"\n I shrugged, trying for the graceful nonchalance that Christian always seemed to have. I didn\u0027t quite pull it off. \"I\u0027m not sure I have to explain my actions to you, Mrs. White. I have agreed to think about joining your organization, but as you know, I am already employed. I would have to seek and obtain a leave of absence from UPRA before I could commit myself. I\u0027m sorry if my little white lie about Christian has led you to question my actions or intentions, but I can assure you that the furthering of knowledge about ghosts and other spectral entities is my number one priority. I do not keep ghosts against their will. I do not make it a habit of hiding information from my employers. I can tell you in all honesty that I do not have any spirits bound to keepers.\"\n She reached across her desk to press a buzzer, a purely unnecessary action, since I knew full well that Eduardo had been watching the entire conversation. \"I am willing to overlook this incident in order to further our working relationship. Regardless, I find myself in a position of needing to protect a valuable resource. For that reason I have arranged accommodations in the town house where the other Trust members have gathered. I am certain you will be very comfortable there, the staff is prone to spoiling the Trust members. We will, of course, collect your things from your acquaintance\u0027s home and bring them to your new rooms. Ah, Eduardo, there you are.\n Miss Telford and I were just having a discussion about the future.\"\n \"Indeed? I gather the confusion over the missing ghosts has been cleared up?\" He smiled a white, toothy smile at me, full of false bonhomie and dark thoughts behind his gray eyes.\n I smiled back, hoping his phony white teeth rotted from his head. He knew full well that the question of the ghosts hadn\u0027t been settled. \"Why, yes, I believe it has. You might try finding a psychic who has a little more delicate touch, as you and Mr. Rick didn\u0027t seem to be able to feel the ghosts.\"\n It was a dig, and it scored points, but oh, how I was to pay for my folly.\n \"And as for your accommodations, Mrs. White, I much appreciate the offer, but I\u0027m quite comfortable where I am. Young love and all that,\" I simpered.\n \"I am afraid I must be quite insistent on this point,\" Guarda said in a tone of voice that brooked no further discussion. \"We have only your best interests at heart, of course.\"\n I have never been one to take orders. Not since my rebirth into a self-aware, confident woman, that is. I made a faux moue of regret. \"Alas, I must be just as insistent. I am certain that such a situation would not at all suit me, perhaps even going so far as to stifle my abilities, leaving me unable to practice those very arts that you would find so attractive.\"\n Subtly would never be said to be my middle name.\n Guarda and Eduardo exchanged glances. A little ripple of power in the room raised goose bumps on my arms. I started to get a bit worried that they might be serious in their attempt to keep me under their control, into the belly of their ARMPIT house and away from Christian. I figured it was time to focus their attention on something else. Perhaps if I appeared to rethink my objections and seemed amiable, I would have an opportunity to escape without damaging our tenuous relationship, a relationship I needed if I were to figure out where Christian\u0027s friend was being held. Then again, perhaps Guarda was too smart to be fooled by a sudden about-face.\n \"Well,\" I said with a little laugh that sounded forced even to my ears, \"let us not get our knickers in a twist, as the English say. I\u0027m sure we can work something out regarding the accommodations. I am very cognizant of the importance of the Trust; perhaps if you told me more about its day-to-day workings, how many members there are, what research projects you have under way, what locations you use, et cetera, I might be more willing to give up an extremely interesting companion for a solitary bed in your town house.\"\n Guarda sent a glance fraught with significance to Eduardo. I cursed the fact that I hadn\u0027t a shred of mind-reading ability in my body, and chastised myself soundly for being so quick to dismiss Christian\u0027s objections to my meeting Guarda alone.\n \"Yes, of course,\" she said, steepling her fingers as Eduardo perched on the edge of her desk. She didn\u0027t look too convinced by my performance, but was obviously going to give me the benefit of the doubt. \"The Trust is, as you know, made up of several influential and important people who have a profound interest in paranormal research. Our headquarters are here, in London, where we have the town house and a research facility, in addition to three other houses in various locations around the U.K., where we spend time conducting experiments into a variety of related paranormal fields. Our primary focus is, of course, spirits and spirit activities.\"\n Three houses, hmm? I put on my best tourist face. \"That sounds fascinating, especially the part about the houses. I assume the houses are active, yes? I love active sites. I\u0027m dying to visit the Tower of London, but I bet you guys have been all over that. Where exactly are these houses? I haven\u0027t had much of a chance to see England, really, other than at night, and generally my touristing is limited to sites with known phenomena.\"\n Eduardo gave me his phony smile again. \"One of our houses is a converted abbey just outside of London. The second is a house in an area in Scotland that has seen several bloody battles; the third is a small cottage in Cornwall that has tremendous activities around the solstices. We believe there is some druid influence there.\"\n \"Druids, really, how very fascinating. What exactly are you doing with the spirits that your Trust members Summon?\" I turned back to look at Guarda and prayed my tone sounded chatty and not in the least prying. \"You mentioned that you wish to keep the ghosts available for research for a little time before Releasing them - what sorts of research are you conducting?\"\n Guarda ran through the usual litany of tests: spectral analysis, aural dissection, ion and EMF examinations, as well as personal histories and interviews regarding their time bound in spirit form. All pretty standard stuff except the last two. What bothered me was that she was lying, and lying big-time, lying through her teeth.\n Summoners have a very good grasp of who is lying and who isn\u0027t. It\u0027s something to do with our sensitivity to minute environmental changes (a ghost\u0027s arrival is always heralded by a slight change in the room temperature and air density). My theory is that our acute awareness of the physical environment is what allows us to detect people in a lie so easily, but other Summoners have other theories.\n All I knew at that point was that Guarda was lying to me.\n \"Fascinating. Well, this has been a really interesting discussion; thank you for being so open with everything. I will think over your offer to stay at the trust house, and will let you know my decision in the next few days. In the meantime, I promised a friend I\u0027d go check out a cold spot in his basement, but I\u0027ll be here bright and early tomorrow morning and we can see about Summoning those two missing ghosts at the theater.\"\n I rose as I spoke, but neither Guarda or Eduardo stood with me. \"I\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t allow that, Allegra,\" Guarda said slowly, then pulled out a desk drawer. I gasped in horror as I looked over her shoulder, and quickly sketched a protective ward in front of me when both she and Eduardo turned to look at the spot I was staring at. I had no time to do more than sketch the one ward (one to each compass point is recommended for a truly dangerous situation), but I was hoping it had the power to stop a bullet should Guarda be reaching for a gun.\n \"Sorry,\" I said when they turned to look back at me, Guarda\u0027s hand holding nothing more dangerous than a sheaf of papers. I slumped in relief and came up with a feeble excuse. \"I thought I saw something. Boy, what a boob I am, eh? I guess it\u0027s a good thing I\u0027m not on tonight!\"\n A handful of papers couldn\u0027t hurt me, right? Right. Not with a ward guarding me, they couldn\u0027t. Behind my back I sketched a second ward, then held my hand tight to my bad leg and traced a third. In order to be fully protected from harm, I needed to trace the fourth, but I couldn\u0027t do it with Eduardo standing there watching me with those cold gray eyes.\n \"As I was saying, I\u0027m afraid you represent too great an asset to the Trust to allow you to go traipsing around damp basements on mere whims. If you had cleared the site through the Trust, we would, of course, be happy to have you investigate it after the proper preliminary work was completed on it. You must allow us to be overprotective of our little charges,\" she added with a horribly insincere smile.\n \"Of course,\" I answered, my stomach knotting with concern. I could feel the waves of hostility rolling off her. Once again she tested the guards on my mind, but they held without the slightest bit of give.\n \"If you will just sign these few papers, everything will be official and we can pay you your first honorarium.\"\n \"Oh? How much is that?\"\n She glanced at Eduardo. \"Five thousand pounds for the first month\u0027s work,\" he answered smoothly.\n I just about dropped my purse. That was almost $7,500! Just for one month?\n \"Gark,\" I said, then suited action to thought and dropped my purse.\n Right on top of a small bud vase containing a perfect yellow rose. The vase was knocked over, breaking the delicate glass and sending the water racing toward Eduardo\u0027s hind end. He leaped up off the table with a nasty word.\n \"Oh, I\u0027m so sorry!\" I gushed as I turned my body sideways and quickly traced the last ward. \"How clumsy of me! Such a pretty rose, too.\"\n \"Never mind, leave it, it\u0027s quite all right.\" Guarda\u0027s mouth was white with tension, but it was nothing compared to what I was feeling. Now that I was protected, shielded from the influence of Guarda\u0027s power, I could feel the threat in the air. It was positively thick with malevolence. She held the pen out to me, but I shook my head and backed away, clutching my purse to my chest.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, I couldn\u0027t. My contract with UPRA says I can\u0027t work for any other organization without their consent. I will have to contact my boss to get permission to join you before I sign anything.\"\n \"We will call him now. Anton Melrose is his name, yes? Give me the number and you may speak with him.\"\n The power rolling out of her manifested itself in me as nausea. I swayed a little, then moved slowly backward until I had the chair between me and her desk. \"No, it\u0027s... uh... Wednesday! Anton always plays golf with the Archbishop of... um... Fresno on Wednesday. He won\u0027t be in the office today.\"\n Eduardo fairly snarled at me. I stepped backward again. \"Then you will resign your position. We will see to it that you are more than adequately compensated financially.\"\n \"Oh, I couldn\u0027t do that,\" I lied as I took another step backward, praying the wards would keep him from reading my lie. \"I owe Anton everything. I couldn\u0027t possibly just quit like that. I couldn\u0027t!\"\n The air behind me stirred. I whirled around, blinking with surprise at the woman who entered the room.\n \"Is there a problem?\" the hermit Phillippa asked, giving me a large berth. \"I can feel your anger all the way down the hall, Guarda. What is amiss?\"\n She stopped next to Eduardo and the three of them looked at me. I collected my jaw from where it was hanging around my knees, and thought fast and furious. If Phillippa was here and on friendly terms with Guarda, that meant she was a part of the Trust. It also meant that Guarda was likely to know that I had Esme and Mr. Woogums as part of my entourage, and that I hadn\u0027t figured out how to Release them.\n All of which added up to some pretty bad trouble for Allegra the Summoner.\n Beloved? Christian\u0027s voice was sleepy, but infinitely reassuring in my mind. I wasn\u0027t alone! You are frightened?\n Very, I answered, twisting my fingers into my purse. I\u0027ve done something stupid.\n I felt his sigh even before his words caressed my mind. Foolish, perhaps, but never stupid, Beloved.\n \"Um, Phillippa, what a surprise. I hadn\u0027t expected to see you here.\"\n I\u0027m in Guarda\u0027s office. With Eduardo and the hermit I told you about. I think they want to force me to go live in their town house. They don\u0027t seem to be inclined to let me walk out of here, Christian.\n His silence was almost as loud as his second sigh. I believe I will withdraw my objection over the word stupid.\n \"Indeed.\" The hermit turned to Guarda. \"She is speaking to someone who is at a distance from us. With whom has she had contact?\"\n My eyes widened. How did she know I was talking to Christian? And could she tell who he was? The need to protect him was very strong, strong enough that I closed down my mind to him.\n I understand, Allegra. It is still daylight; I cannot come to rescue you.\n I swallowed hard. Christian seemed so normal to me, I\u0027d forgotten that he couldn\u0027t go out in daylight.\n I will send help.\n Just the touch of his mind in mine reminded me that I was not a victim; I was a woman in charge of her life. I raised my chin a notch and stared down my nose at Phillippa.\n \"Really? How very interesting.\" Guarda looked at me with speculation, then edged around her desk and approached me. I backed up until she stopped a few feet away from me. The ward I\u0027d sketched in the air suddenly flared to life, glowing a shimmering gold in the pale, watery light of a rainy November afternoon.\n \"Wards!\" Guarda hissed, then shot me a look of loathing that I won\u0027t soon forget.\n Phillippa walked a circle around me. As she reached each ward, it burst into light, fading when she passed its range of protection.\n \"She is guarded,\" Phillippa acknowledged. \"Still, there may be a way.\"\n Uh-oh. I didn\u0027t like the sound of that. I prayed Christian was going to summon the fire department or other emergency service, because I had a worrisome notion that whatever Phillippa was planning, it wasn\u0027t going to be fun.\n \"Um. You know, I think I\u0027ll just be leaving. We can talk about this whole Trust thing another day. My fianc¨¦ will be waiting for me.\"\n They ignored me to huddle together and speak in tones so quiet I couldn\u0027t hear them. I knew as soon as I neared the door that Guarda had done something to it, had warded it so that it would not allow anyone to pass through the door whom she wished to remain within, but I gave it a shot anyway. None of the three even bothered to as much as look my way as I struggled to press through the invisible wall that denied exit to me.\n \"Hell\u0027s bells,\" I snarled to myself, and took a step back to collect myself. A ward could be undone if you studied it and determine how it was made. Every person who drew wards did so by following a basic format, then personalizing it, adding a word here, a gesture there, something that didn\u0027t interfere with the basic function of the ward, but which made it unique and impossible to remove unless you had the time and leisure to examine it closely. It wasn\u0027t actually the ward itself that provided the power; it was the belief the person drawing it had in his own abilities. That was why infrequently drawn wards, like the one I used on Christian at Joy\u0027s house, were likely to dissolve after a short amount of time. I hadn\u0027t used them enough to have complete faith in my ability to draw them.\n Guarda\u0027s ward, however, glowed silver when I pushed myself into the doorway, and was of such a complex design that it would take me hours to unravel.\n Allegra.\n The voice was loud in my head, compelling, demanding, filled with absolute authority. It was not Christian\u0027s silken tones.\n Against my will I turned around slowly. The four wards around me glowed gold, but I ignored them to blink at the scene before me. Guarda and Phillippa stood together, unmoving as they watched me with eyes that were empty, as if they were looking inward on themselves. Behind them Eduardo sat on the desk, his head tipped back, his eyes closed, his hands stretched forward to hold... I gasped and tried to back up. I couldn\u0027t; my feet were frozen, locking me in place as I stared in horror at the three of them. Eduardo\u0027s fingers were pressed to the base of both their necks.\n They had formed a triumvirate, the most powerful force known to modern psychics.\n And they had breached my defenses. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-and-the-single-vampire-dark-ones-2/page-11.html","bookId":2203,"book":{"id":2203,"title":"Sex and the Single Vampire (Dark Ones #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Sex and the Single Vampire (Dark Ones, #2) \n If Allie doesn\u0027t find a ghost soon, her short career as a \"Summoner\" with United Psychical Research Association will be a thing of the past, so naturally she is delighted to find what she thinks is the tortured spirit of a gorgeous, naked, wounded man.
