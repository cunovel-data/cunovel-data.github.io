{"id":101634,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"By the time I made it back to my hotel room, it was too late to call the SIP offices and try to get the name and address of the hermit (man or woman, I wasn\u0027t sure which) I thought might be able to help me with my Release problem. I took a long bath instead, soaking my leg until I was all pruney, then got into a pair of soft sleeping shorts and a T-shirt, wrapping myself up in an oversize lumpy green bathrobe. With my scarred leg and odd eyes and decidedly frumpy nightwear I might not be a fashion plate, but I was certainly comfortable. \"Well, Mr. Kitty, it looks like it\u0027s just you and me again tonight. I hope you do your disappearing act tomorrow when the maid comes in. I\u0027ll send you on as soon as I can, but don\u0027t hold your breath until then. I need to talk to that hermit first.\" I spent some time writing up notes on the evening\u0027s events, then pulled on my sweatpants and shirt to pop downstairs to leave Corrine an e-mail saying I had her book and would bring it home with me. That done, I hung around the lounge for a bit, but eventually the strange looks I was getting (sweatpants and sunglasses were evidently not considered haute couture) were enough to send me back up to the privacy of my room. \"I see privacy is a relative term in London,\" I commented as I closed the door behind me. Christian was in possession of the sole comfortable armchair in the room, his legs crossed with casual elegance, the fingers of one hand rubbing his chin as he watched the three-legged cat roll on its back and bat with ineffectual paws at the fringe of the bedspread. \"How did you get in here, what do you think you\u0027re doing, what was your little game last night, who were those people who ran off, how dare you think I knew anything about that madwoman with the gun, and are you or are you not a vampire?\" Sleek sable eyebrows pulled together as he rose gracefully to his feet and made an exquisite bow. \"I don\u0027t believe we\u0027ve been formally introduced. I am Christian Johann Dante. Your name is...\" He frowned. \"Allie?\" \"It is. It\u0027s short for Allegra.\" \"Ah. I dislike diminutives; they are so common. I will use Allegra.\" My hackles went up instantly. I crossed the room to snag the wooden seat sitting before the dressing table, hauling it into a position from which I could more effectively glare at him. \"Is that so? Well for your information, Mr. Stuck-up, my twin brother gave me that nickname. My brother who died eighteen years later in the same accident that crippled my right leg. So you\u0027ll have to pardon me if I don\u0027t find it at all common.\" He stood watching me for a moment until I made an annoyed sound and told him to sit down. \"I am sorry that you lost your brother. I, too, lost a dearly loved brother in my youth. It took me many years to forgive myself for living when he died.\" I glanced up at him, startled that he felt the same way about his brother\u0027s death that I did when Leslie died. \"Tell me of this accident. How old were you when it occurred?\" I slammed the guards on my mind down tight against the gentle probes I could feel him sending out. No one played in my head without an invitation. \"Why don\u0027t you try answering a few questions before you start asking them? Namely, how did you get in here?\" He shrugged, an elegant move that matched all of his other elegant moves. Even though he was dressed in a simple black sweater with simple black pants, I had the strangest sense that I wasn\u0027t seeing him as he really was - he should be dressed in silk shirts with ruffled fronts and lace on the cuffs, I thought, with those colorful vests that men wore a couple hundred years ago, and tight breeches and boots that reached to his knees. And a riding crop - he looked very much like a riding crop kind of guy. \"I wished to speak with you. I had no idea that your room was already occupied.\" This he said looking at the cat, now engaged in licking its belly, \"or that you would find my presence so objectionable. I felt that after the evening\u0027s deplorable event we had some unfinished business to settle.\" \"Uh-huh,\" I said, not in the least bit convinced. \"Unfinished business like just what were you doing last night? And how did you get out of there so quickly? Wait a minute - answer my last question first: Are you a vampire?\" His eyes glittered mahogany and gold at me, but other than the slight incline of one eyebrow, he didn\u0027t look at all perturbed to be having this conversation. \"I am Moravian, what is commonly referred to as a Dark One.\" Well, that was a big help. \"So you\u0027re a vampire?\" His fingers made an elegant gesture that left the question unanswered. \"Okay, let\u0027s try this: Do you drink people\u0027s blood to survive?\" He sat extremely still. \"Yes,\" he finally answered, the velvet of his voice giving the word a power I\u0027d never felt before. \"Are you immortal?\" Again the hesitation. \"I can be killed.\" \"Most living beings can. Let me rephrase that - what year were you born?\" His gaze never left my face. \"In the year of our Lord eleven hundred and twelve.\" I did a bit of quick mental subtraction. \"That sounds pretty immortal to me. Do you burn to a crisp in the light of the sun?\" A slight smile played around on the corners of his lips. I suddenly wanted to be that smile. \"Burn to a crisp? No, but I do not find sunlight particularly healthy.\" \"Fine. So you\" - I ticked the items off on my fingers - \"drink blood to survive, are more or less immortal, and avoid sunlight. Well, you know, that sounds like a vampire to me!\" \"Dark Ones are frequently referred to as vampires,\" he allowed. \"I hear a \u0027but\u0027 in there.\" The smile grew, making me feel a bit too warm in my comfy sweats. \"The mythology of vampires and the history of Dark Ones is similar, but not identical.\" \"Oh. So you\u0027re like, what, a benign vampire? A quasi-vampire? Vamp light? Do you go around doing good deeds? Or are you merely a vampire with a really big chip on his shoulder who likes to push people around and slice himself up for fun and profit?\" He actually had the nerve to look martyred at my words. \"You are the most irreverent woman I have ever met.\" \"And you\u0027re changing the subject.\" \"I shall do so again: Why do you have the spirit of a cat in your hotel room?\" \"Can you think of a better place to keep it?\" I asked, then immediately regretted the retort. \"This room is supposed to be haunted. I was trying to Summon the ghost who resides here, and got her cat instead.\" \"Is that what you were doing last night at the old inn?\" \"You haven\u0027t finished answering my questions.\" \"I believe a conversation is traditionally made up of give and take. I have given; now I expect to take.\" It was the way he said it that made me feel both extremely turned on and furious at his high-handed arrogance. I stood up and fisted my hands on my hips. \"Yes, I was at the inn last night to Summon ghosts. It\u0027s what I do, I\u0027m a Summoner. I didn\u0027t have any success, if that is your next question. This cat is the sum total of all the ghosts I\u0027ve managed to Summon, so I\u0027ll thank you to be a bit nicer about him. He may not be great, but he\u0027s all I have. And besides, I\u0027ve tried to send him on, but something\u0027s screwed up in my Release invocation.\" He smiled again, and once again my body (pro-Christian) warred with my mind (definitely anti-Christian). \"So you couldn\u0027t have Released me last night had I been a soul in torment?\" I threw my hands up, then let them fall to my hips. \"How do I know? I haven\u0027t tried to Release a human spirit! Now, I\u0027ve given; it\u0027s your turn again. What were you doing there last night?\" The smile faded as he got to his feet, taking two steps until he was close enough to me that I could feel the heat from his body. He pulled my dark glasses from my face, examining first one eye, then the other; then his finger traced the line of my jaw. I wanted to pull back, to move away from the strange attraction that he held for me, but I couldn\u0027t. His eyes were warm and dark on mine, his finger stirring little frissons of fire down my neck, blossoming out to every conceivable part of my body. \"Joy believes you are my Beloved, the woman who is meant to spend her life with me.\" \"Oh,\" I breathed, not wanting him to stop touching me, but not allowing myself to fall under his spell. I knew what it was to give power over oneself to a man; I\u0027d never make that mistake again. With an effort, I stepped back. His eyes were shuttered as he dropped his hand. \"I think Joy has the wrong woman.\" He looked at me strangely for a moment, then nodded. \"I believe you are correct. I would know my Beloved the moment I saw her, and she likewise, yet I have no awareness of you unless I am in your presence. I fear I must disappoint Joy with the truth.\" \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll recover,\" I said, my voice a bit hoarse. \"I know I will strive to.\" The half smile reappeared on his lips again; then suddenly I was in his arms, pressed up against his chest, his thighs hard against my legs. \"Then it cannot matter if we put the question to a brief test, can it?\" he asked just before his mouth swooped down to capture mine. I will say one thing for the man: living more than nine hundred years had taught him how to kiss. His lips started out all hard and domineering, then suddenly turned soft. His tongue probed, then slid in, doing things I\u0027d never imagined a tongue could do. I let him kiss me for about a minute before he pulled away enough to speak without his tongue in my mouth. \"You are not helping?\" \"Give the man a cigar.\" He pulled away even farther so he could glare into my eyes better. \"You are attracted to me; I can feel it. You enjoy looking at me. Your heart rate speeds up when I am near you, yet you do not allow yourself to take pleasure in a simple kiss?\" \"Look, Romeo, I\u0027m attracted to a lot of men, that doesn\u0027t mean anything other than that I have a healthy libido. And I doubt if anything, even a kiss, is simple where you\u0027re concerned.\" He looked oddly pleased with that statement. \"We will try it again, and this time you will join in.\" I stepped back. \"Thanks, but I think you\u0027ve checked my teeth aplenty tonight.\" His eyes turned ebony. \"Oh, stop doing that, you big show-off!\" I pushed him back and went to get a few tools from my bag. If I was going to have to entertain a vampire in my hotel room, the least I could do was take some readings on him. That was what I told myself. My brain, however, knew that I needed to put some physical distance between us before I threw myself on him and kissed the fangs right out of his head. When I turned back to him he was leaning against the wall, one long finger rubbing against the lovely curve of his lower lip. My mind rebelled for a moment and flashed glorious Technicolor, wide-screen memories of what it felt like to have those lips caressing mine. I told my mental projectionist to take the evening off, and started checking out Christian\u0027s ion levels. \"Why do you wear the clothing of a man?\" I ignored the question and switched on the thermal-imaging recorder. \"I do not want my woman to ape masculine habits. Women should be feminine, soft, giving. It is your role in life, yet you are none of those things.\" \"Which is probably why it\u0027s a good thing I\u0027m not your woman,\" I answered, giving more orders to my mind to stop imagining what it would be like to be with him. He might be sexy as hell, but he was also domineering and arrogant, two traits that can be very dangerous. \"I said that you were not my Beloved; I said nothing about you not being my woman.\" I shivered at the undertone of dark promise in his voice. I thought I remembered reading somewhere that vampires could seduce with their voices alone - of that I had no doubt. I clicked on the digital voice recorder. Maybe someone back at the UPRA offices could analyze his voice and see what made it so beautiful and evocative. \"So were you born this way, or did another vampire snack on you and turn you?\" \"You are also too independent and obstinate, and you lack self-confidence.\" I ground my teeth and turned on the EMF counter, making notes of the readings. I would not let him goad me into - Hey! I squinted my eyes at him in the meanest possible manner. \"Obstinate? Lacking self-confidence? Well, aren\u0027t you just full of the insults?\" \"They are not insults, just statements.\" \"Fine, well, let\u0027s try on a few more for size, shall we?\" I set down the EMF counter and limped over to him, poking a finger into his chest. He captured my hand with his, refusing to let it go. I ignored the wonderful things his touch did to me, and let him have it with both barrels. \"For your information, Dracula, women have been emancipated. We can think on our own, make our own choices, and even - heaven forbid! - live our lives in comfort and happiness without any know-it-all males telling us what to do. Furthermore, I am a Summoner. It goes with the territory that my mind is strong. Strong is not obstinate. And as for self-confidence, I\u0027m very confident in myself and my abilities. Just because I haven\u0027t had a lot of success Summoning doesn\u0027t mean that I can\u0027t do it. I can, I know I can, but it\u0027s not an exact science and there\u0027s a lot of elements that come into play when you\u0027re dealing with ghosts.\" \"I wasn\u0027t speaking of your self-confidence relating to your skills; I was referring to the fact that you find your appearance lacking.\" There\u0027s nothing I can do about my appearance,\" I snapped. \"I\u0027m well aware of my shortcomings, if that\u0027s what you mean. I don\u0027t consider dealing with what I\u0027ve got as best I can as expressing a lack of self-confidence.\" \"You hide your very feminine body behind the cover of shapeless male clothing just as you hide your eyes behind dark glasses.\" \"I wear pants because they\u0027re a heck of a lot more comfortable when crawling around haunted houses than a skirt and heels. I wear dark glasses because being called a freak gets a bit wearisome after the fiftieth time. Any more questions, Sherlock? Or can I get on with taking a few readings?\" \"You hide your attraction to me behind denial.\" I grinned and checked him for any ultrasonic emissions. \"Oh, so now we get to the truth of your complaints. You\u0027re just pissed because I didn\u0027t respond to your kiss. Your smug masculine pride has been hurt. Poor little Christian, used to swooning maidens whenever you lay a lip on them, is that it? I guess the real test of a man\u0027s attraction comes down to what he can do without the enhancement of a little mental push to aid a seduction, eh?\" In hindsight, I saw that baiting him was not the wisest course of action. Lesson to the smart: Never challenge a vampire\u0027s masculinity unless you\u0027re made of marble, or are dead. You just can\u0027t win. He was on me before I could take a breath, my body slammed up hard against his, his arms immovable and impossibly hard behind me. But it wasn\u0027t his arms that worried me; it was the look of determination in his beautiful (now a rich walnut) eyes. \"You are impossible,\" he said against my mouth, his body quickly becoming aroused. Mine answered the call despite my sending out the fire department to extinguish all the delightfully tingly fires he started. \"You mock me, you abuse me, you do not respect the power that I hold, and yet you make me feel things I\u0027ve not felt for centuries.\" For a moment he slipped into my mind, and I felt myself go soft against him at the recognition of his need. I hadn\u0027t forgotten the torment I\u0027d felt both in the dream about him and in the inn, but I had assumed it was greatly exaggerated in my mind. Now I knew it wasn\u0027t; Christian was a deep well of desperate need, the need for the purity of love to salvage his soul, to pull him from the abyss of anguish and despair that filled him. I closed him out of my mind more as a self-preservation tactic than anything else, and rallied my strength to resist the lure of his lips just as his mouth closed on mine. This time there was no softness in him. He was all dominance, quickly overpowering any resistance I had until I had no choice but to allow him into my mouth. He was consuming me, overwhelming me, and I knew in a desperate part of my mind that if I didn\u0027t do something, he would take everything I had and leave me empty, drained, a shell of what I had been. Struggling was not an option, nor was I sure I could. Even as I feared his control, pleasure burned bright in every touch of his lips and tongue. Instinct saved me, instinct and the desire I felt that he would not allow me to deny. I melted against him, tempering his hard body with my softness, feeding his power with my own. Miraculously the kiss changed from dominance to something erotic, a joining of our desires that quickly went beyond a mere touching of mouths. Without even thinking, I took his pain into my body and returned it with warmth. He tore his mouth from mine, suddenly releasing me. I swayed against him for a minute, then regained control of my body. \"All right,\" I said, turning away so I wouldn\u0027t have to see the triumph in his eyes. \"You\u0027ve made your point. You\u0027re the world\u0027s champion kisser. Fine. I\u0027ll have a plaque made up in the morning. Now will you just leave me be? I have work to do.\" I gathered the necessities and eased myself down on the floor. The cat was curled up underneath the armchair, sleeping. Christian remained silent as I traced a circle with chalk. I finally gave in and glanced at him. He stood watching me, the expected look of triumph strangely absent from his eyes. Instead he looked almost... vulnerable. I quickly returned my gaze to the circle. An arrogant, dominant Christian I could deal with. One that looked as shaken as I felt by our kiss was a beast of a different color. I ached, I positively ached to comfort him, to take him into my arms and kiss that look of sorrow and pain from his face, but I knew well how a man of his domineering mien would react to such a gesture - he would take my heartfelt offer and twist it into a way to control me. Never again, I vowed, and traced the wards of protection on my left hand and over my right eye. \"What are you doing?\" His voice skimmed my skin like a sultry breeze. I reinforced the circle, worried that his presence had distracted me enough to leave the circle open (and thus useless). \"I\u0027m a Summoner; hence, I\u0027m Summoning.\" \"Why?\" Evidently he had recovered from our kiss. I hadn\u0027t. I was still quivering inside, but not so much that I couldn\u0027t slide him an annoyed look. \"It\u0027s what Summoners do. If I\u0027m boring you, feel free to leave.\" He leaned back against the wall again. \"My questions was not why do you Summon, but why are you doing it now? I thought you tried earlier and only raised the cat?\" I thought about saying something about persistence and not giving up, then figured he\u0027d turn that against me by crowing over the effect he had on me. Instead I opened up the dead man\u0027s ash and tried to clear my mind. \"I\u0027ll continue to try to Summon the human ghost until I have to go home.\" Before he could speak I said the words of Summoning, opening the door in my mind to all possibilities, sprinkling the ash liberally over the circle. As before it floated all over, some in the circle, other bits drawn by my warmth to float around my face. \"That looks rather messy. Isn\u0027t there a more efficient way to Summon a spirit?\" \"Comments from the undead are entirely optional,\" I told him as I waved away the ash, peering into the circle. Just as it had all four times at the inn, the circle wasn\u0027t doing anything. \"Dratted\" - I pinched the bridge of my nose - \"ash. Gets everywhere. Oh, no, I think I\u0027m going to... to...\" I sneezed. When I opened my eyes Christian was standing next to me, staring intently at the circle. Within its confines the air gathered itself, slowly turning opaque, until the form of a short, hefty woman in a bathrobe, with a headful of fat sausage curls, emerged from the mist. I stared up at the ghost, the hairs on my arms standing on end as I realized that I\u0027d done it; I\u0027d Summoned my first human ghost! All by myself! Woobah! A tanned hand (how did a vampire get a tan? Were there undead tanning salons?) appeared in front of my face. I took it and allowed him to pull me to my feet. I looked at Christian. He cocked an eyebrow at me, and looked back at the ghost. I looked at her, too. She was dressed in what looked suspiciously like my comfy green bathrobe, and a neck-to-ankles flannel nightgown. She must have been sleeping when the hotel was bombed. I grounded the spirit and opened the circle. \"Urn... hello. I take it you\u0027re the lady who died in the fire.\" She stretched and patted her hair. \"Well, I don\u0027t remember a fire, but I was staying in this room. Esme is my name, Esme Cartwright. And you are?\" \"My name is Allie. Allegra,\" I corrected, sliding a glance toward Christian. \"This is Christian Dante.\" \"It is the utmost pleasure to meet you, madam,\" he said, bowing in the deliciously foreign way he had. \"Oh, my, a Dark One!\" She tittered at Christian and made what I\u0027d have called (if she hadn\u0027t been dead more than fifty years) eyes at him. Then she turned back to me with a perky smile. \"You have excellent taste my dear. He\u0027s quite easy on the eyes.\" \"Oh, he\u0027s not mine,\" I protested. Christian wrapped one of his steely arms around me and hauled me up to his side. \"We are trying to work out the exact nature of our relationship.\" \"No, we\u0027re not,\" I said, elbowing his side until he released me. \"There is no relationship and nothing to work out.\" \"Oh, a lovers\u0027 spat!\" Esme said happily, clapping her hands. I glared at her. \"I have several young friends, and all of them say I give the best advice. You must turn to me in your time of need, child.\" It was a battle to keep from rolling my eyes, but I won. Eventually. \"Thank you, Mrs. Cartwright. I\u0027ll keep your offer in mind.\" \"Esme, dear,\" she gently corrected me. \"First names are so much more convivial, don\u0027t you think? And now you must tell me what I\u0027m doing here, for the last thing I knew I\u0027d just decided to take a long sleep after that horrible episode with the newlyweds who took umbrage when I popped in to offer them a bit of helpful advice.\" At last! The moment I\u0027d been training for, the moment that I\u0027d mentally rehearsed for long, long hours. I cleared my throat and ignored Christian\u0027s disturbing nearness as best as possible. \"I have called you forth to further mankind\u0027s knowledge of the life that is found after death. With your permission, I will take a few readings, ask you a few questions, and then it will be my pleasure to Release you and send you on to your next destination. If you feel you have any tasks left you would like accomplished before you move on, I will be happy to undertake them to the best of my abilities. Be aware, however, that you passed over more than fifty years ago, so the likelihood of my being able to contact loved ones is very slight.\" It was a lovely speech, it truly was, delivered from the heart, but Esme didn\u0027t seem to hear much of it. The cat, evidently disturbed by the Summoning, emerged from under the chair. She took one look at it, then rushed over and scooped it up in her arms, squealing and kissing it and spinning around as she clasped the poor thing to her ample breast. \"Woogums! Mummy\u0027s widdle Woogums!\" \"Hmm,\" I said as I pulled out my notebook to make a notation. \"Interesting. Ghosts Summoned at the same physical location can interact physically with each other.\" \"Evidently,\" Christian replied, a faint grimace on his lips as he watched Esme rain smacking kisses down on the cat\u0027s head. \"What, haven\u0027t you ever had a pet?\" I asked. \"Several. They all died.\" I glanced up at him, struck once again by the pain that darkened his eyes. \"What is it you want from me?\" The words were out of my mouth before I could stop them. A smile quirked his lips, lightening his eyes to a middling oak color. \"Would salvation be too much to ask?\" I clamped down on the smile that wanted to answer his. \"Probably.\" \"I see. In that case, perhaps you will join me tomorrow evening? There is an exhibition that I think you might find interesting.\" \"Woogie woogie Woogums! Did oo miss Mummy? Mummy missed her Woogums!\" \"What sort of an exhibition?\" \"Perhaps a better term would be demonstration. A local medium is hosting a series of Summonings, open to the public.\" I wondered how Christian knew about the psychic shindig, then figured he must have had an ear to the paranormal grapevine. \"I heard about that. I suppose it might be interesting, although I\u0027m at a loss as to why you want to take me there. After all, I\u0027m not in the least bit feminine or submissive or docile, and of course, I have this great huge problem with my self-image.\" He took two steps forward and held my chin between his thumb and forefinger. Little flames of desire licked down my neck at his touch. \"You are also a very talented woman, intelligent if rather distant emotionally.\" The flames froze solid. I smacked his hand away, ignoring Esme\u0027s horrified gasp of surprise. \"You are just about the rudest man I\u0027ve ever met. You\u0027ve done nothing but insult me ever since you came here - uninvited, I might add - and now you have the balls to tell me I\u0027m frigid?\" I took a deep breath and pointed to the door. \"Don\u0027t let the door hit you in the butt as you go out.\" \"Allie,\" Esme the ghost shrieked. \"Child, that is no way to speak to your man! Firm, yes, but never, ever demanding. It isn\u0027t ladylike.\" Christian smiled at me - smirked, really, a knowing, full-of-himself smirk that made my hand itch to slap it off his face; then he made another one of those old-fashioned bows that would have looked ridiculous performed by any other man, but which fit him perfectly. \"I shall call for you at eight of the clock.\" \"Out!\" I snapped, stabbing my finger at the door. \"Esme, it was a distinct pleasure. I hope to see you again, but if Allegra determines what is wrong with her Release spell and I am unable to, bon chance.\" \"Oh, my! Christian, you really are the charmer, aren\u0027t you? I\u0027m sure I will be around for quite some time. I can see that Allie needs a guiding hand, a mother\u0027s helpful advice.\" \"Esme, you\u0027re not my mother. And you are dead. Those are just two reasons why advice from you is not needed.\" Her lower lip quivered, and her eyes filled with ghostly tears. \"I hope you are pleased with yourself. You have made a spirit cry.\" I glared at Christian for a moment. \"Weren\u0027t you just leaving? Oh, Esme, I\u0027m sorry; I didn\u0027t mean to hurt your feelings. It\u0027s just that... well, I have a mother. She\u0027s very much alive, and she\u0027s full of good advice, so although I appreciate your concern - \" The ghost sniffed and pulled a handkerchief from her pocket, blowing her nose. I made a mental note to record the fact that ghosts\u0027 noses got stuffy when they cried. \"But you\u0027re American! She must live in America, surely? You need a mother figure here, child. You obviously have a great deal to learn about men, and since I\u0027ve had four husbands, I\u0027m just the person to tell you what\u0027s what. Now you run along, Christian,\" she said, tucking her handkerchief away, a smile once again brightening her face. She made shooing motions toward him. \"Allie and I have a great deal to talk about, and none of it is fit for a man\u0027s ears.\" \"Oh, Lord, what have I done?\" I moaned softly to myself. Christian\u0027s amused smile turned into an out-and-out grin. He inclined his head toward Esme. \"You have my full permission to - how is it said? - whip her into shape.\" His words fell like shards of glass on tender flesh. I wondered if he had ever been whipped. I had. It wasn\u0027t an expression I used lightly. The smile faded off his face as his gaze shifted to me. \"Allegra? Is something amiss?\" I could feel him testing the guards I\u0027d sent on my mind, searching for any cracks that would allow him in. I forced down the pain that had risen at his words and stretched my lips into a smile. \"Everything\u0027s fine. Good night, Christian.\" He continued to stare at me for a minute, probing my mind gently, but my will was strong. Closing my mind to others was the first step in self-preservation that I\u0027d learned. It was a hard lesson, but one that was instinctive to me now. He nodded abruptly, then turned and went out the door. I closed it behind him, leaning against it as I blew out a whoosh of breath. I hadn\u0027t realized just how he upset the balance of my mind until he\u0027d left. I felt drained, unfinished, almost as if part of me had walked out the door with him. \"Fancies, sheer and utter fancies.\" I shook my head at myself and straightened my shoulders. Disturbing influence or no, I had work to do. I would not let a handsome man with wicked eyes and seductive lips interfere. No matter how hard he tried to dominate me, I would remain in control. I kept my smile firmly attached as I turned to the waiting ghost. \"Just a word of advice, dear. Your smile should be representative of your inner beauty, of your natural gentleness.
