{"id":101648,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\"How very curious,\" Asmodeus drawled as he stepped forward. \"I had not thought you would return, but when we saw you arrive I realized just how clever you had been.\"\n \"She lied; I told you she lied,\" Eduardo said with a snarl.\n \"She did not lie; she told the truth... the truth as it was at that moment. Yes, it was very clever indeed. I almost regret that such a keen mind and undaunted spirit should be lost to give me new life, but alas, that is the way of things.\"\n I had been watching Christian while Asmodeus circled around me, but suddenly the amulet glowed red-hot, making me jump. One of my feet stepped outside of the circle Asmodeus had been about to close around me.\n \"Tricky,\" I told him, trying to calm my racing heart.\n If he had been a second faster, I might even now be trapped within the power of his circle. \"But not tricky enough.\"\n He smiled and I lost a few years of my life keeping my eyes on his. \"It was worth a try.\"\n I looked from him to Christian. He stood silent and still, his face pale, his eyes dulled with pain and suffering. I thought of the dream warning and knew I couldn\u0027t look to him for help until I freed him from his bonds.\n \"Tirana, come forward. See thou that human?\" I pointed to Eduardo. As the strongest of the triumvirate, he was my target. \"Know thou what my will is?\"\n Tirana sighed and crossed its chubby little arms over the ruffled bib front of its dress. \"Can we skip the hokey medieval-speak and just get to what you want me to do?\"\n \"Destroy him,\" I said simply.\n Eduardo shrieked and reached for Phillippa and Guarda. Tirana leaped for Eduardo and was immediately thrown backward. The protective ward in front of me burned green, then white, then a shimmering silver as the triumvirate blasted me with power. I braced my legs apart, lowered my head, muttered a protective spell, and gathered my power. The amulet glowed silver with the wards as I gave my power form, then quickly turned it and slammed it into Eduardo.\n The sudden wave of my power rocked the triumvirate. I threw my head back and laughed with the joy of it, unleashing the full power of my love for Christian, power that flowed in a silver stream from my hands to pour over the triumvirate.\n \"Never underestimate the power of a ticked off Beloved,\" I told them, giving them a dose of my determination and willpower, and a healthy dollop of respect for the living and the dead. Phillippa screamed and crumpled.\n My joy was short-lived. Eduardo snarled an oath and hauled a limp Phillippa back into place, pounding me with wave after wave of excruciatingly painful raw power. It was tainted as he was tainted, foul, draining me by the very nature of its dark source. I fought it with everything I had, but the combined power of the triumvirate would overcome me in the end. I withstood it for a moment, my eyes on Christian. He watched me silently, impassively, apparently not aware or not caring that I was being torn apart by the people he had given himself up to. It was useless, a hopeless attempt at rescue that was doomed from the very start. I couldn\u0027t beat the triumvirate and Asmodeus together. For a moment I considered the possibility of just giving in.\n Thoughts of Christian filled my mind. Memories of him, of his love for me, of us together merged with those of the ghosts, and how they had so bravely prepared to fight Sarra for us. They were more than just ghosts; they were my friends.\n \"I am not a quitter,\" I said through my teeth, then shouted the next few words. \"I will not let the monsters win.\"\n I dredged up every ounce, every minuscule morsel and shred and iota of power I had, everything from the beating of my heart to the breath that filled my lungs, gathered it, formed it, and prepared to channel it to the target. I cleared my mind, holding it on the image of Eduardo even when it screamed in protest. I knew that what I was doing was professional suicide. To focus my power through my own mind would fry out every psychic circuit I had. I would never Summon another ghost, never cast a spell, never see a ward, never again understand the beautiful balance between nature and magic. I was killing a part of myself that I had crafted so painfully from the shards of my broken past; I would be giving it all up, but one glance at Christian gave my resolve new meaning.\n I understood now what it meant to love someone more than my own life.\n Christian\u0027s name was on my lips as I released my power, the force of it blinding me, throwing me backward, pain unlike anything I\u0027ve ever known rippling through me, gathering strength until it burst out in the form of psychic power, ripping into Eduardo and leaving him shrieking and begging Asmodeus for help.\n My power was spent quickly, trickling to a thin stream, then stopping. I staggered, so weak I could hardly stand, my mind and body and even my soul numb with what I had wrought.\n The demon lord gave me a pitying smile. \"And so now it begins.\"\n He turned to Eduardo and started feeding him power.\n I opened my hand and stared down at what I held, then threw my handful of bobbles on Asmodeus. \"Spirits mine, I Summon you.\"\n All six ghosts materialized and leaped straight for the demon lord, taking him off guard. He yanked his power from Eduardo to protect himself, which opened Eduardo\u0027s weakened self up to attack by Tirana.\n I threw myself at Christian, half knocking him over, half dragging him down to the space between one of the couches and the wall.\n I lay panting on him, exhausted, my last shreds of strength worn away, my fingers shaking in his hair. \"Christian, quickly, we have little time. We have to Join now while everyone is distracted and weak.\"\n His dull black eyes stared unblinking at me.\n I shook his head. \"Come on, snap out of it! We have to do this now, right now! Only Joined together will we have the power to defeat the demon lord.\"\n His eyes were dead, his flesh cold. I shook him again, sobbing with frustration. I knew the ghosts couldn\u0027t drain enough power from Asmodeus to keep him from us longer than a few seconds.\n Please, Christian, please. If you love me, come back to me. We can fight this together, only together, but you have to come back to me. Don\u0027t leave me alone. You promised you wouldn\u0027t leave me!\n I felt his mind stirring, but it wasn\u0027t enough. His eyes were still dead, his body unresponsive, his inner self locked in a nightmare that he had permitted in order to save me.\n I slapped him as hard as I could, but it did no good. His open eyes didn\u0027t even blink. \"I will not let him have you. You\u0027re mine, do you hear me? Mine!\"\n He lay passive while I kissed him, sobbing into his mouth as I bit his lip hard enough to draw blood, licking off the hot bead of his blood before I pulled out my silver hatpin and slashed open a wound on my wrist. I held my bloody wrist to his mouth and willed him to drink. Behind me, around me, around us the air was filled with screams as Tirana tried its best to fulfill my command and destroy Eduardo. Shrieks from the ghosts told me that Asmodeus had recovered from the surprise attack and was taking his vengeance on them. I sobbed out a prayer as I held my wrist over Christian\u0027s closed lips, praying for the souls of my spirit friends, praying for Christian to open his mouth, praying for me.\n A ruby red drop of my blood welled from the cut and slowly trickled down my wrist, where it hung for a second, swaying gently with the beat of my pulse; then it swelled and fell.\n Christian\u0027s lips parted just as it was about to strike his mouth. The drop of blood disappeared into the dark depths within.\n The couch was ripped away from the wall and sent flying across the room, where it exploded in a maelstrom of leather and wood. Asmodeus stood above us, his glamour shredded, his true form visible. It was awful, truly horrible to behold, a parody of a human, a twisted frame that once was made up of flesh and bones and now was bound together by misery and hatred, a crown of deceit topping long, grizzled locks that snaked around his twisted body with a life of their own.\n \"Now you will fulfill your destiny,\" the demon lord screamed, reaching for me. The amulet burned bright for a moment, then shattered, falling from my neck. He hauled me forward, his long teeth black with sin as they were bared above my exposed throat. I clutched at the hand that was choking me, but had nowhere near the strength to pry his horrible fingers from my neck.\n You certainly do seem to relish dramatic scenes, a warm, silky voice spoke into the shattered remains of my mind. We\u0027re going to have to talk about this as well.\n In the bathtub? I asked, wanting to weep and sing at the same time.\n As you command.\n Asmodeus\u0027s head snapped around as Christian rose to his feet. If I weren\u0027t being held by my throat six inches off the ground, I would have cheered, Christian looked so beautiful. His eyes were a beautiful deep mahogany, licked with gold and glittering brightly as he stalked toward us with an elegant grace that made my heart beat madly. His mind merged with mine and suddenly I had the strength to tear myself away from Asmodeus, my body - our body - filled with power that seemed to flow from our joined souls as we turned toward Asmodeus. His fingers tightened around my throat. I broke his grip, surprised to find that a ring he wore came off in my hand, our power flowing in a sweet rush that gave me the strength to push myself away from the demon lord.\n Christian smiled as I took my place next to him, reluctantly pulling himself from my mind.\n \"I told you she was too strong for you,\" he told Asmodeus, taking my hand and giving Tirana a curious glance.\n \"It was all I could raise,\" I explained as Eduardo, the victor in their battle, spun the little demon into the air, its curls spinning madly, lengthening, stretching, reaching out as if they would snare Eduardo. Phillippa lay at Guarda\u0027s feet, unconscious or dead, I wasn\u0027t sure which. Guarda stood with her hands outstretched, her eyes blind as she continued to feed Eduardo her power. I looked on the two of them almost benignly now, secure in the power and strength our Joining had given us. It wouldn\u0027t take much for us to overcome them.\n \"You overestimate both the woman and yourself,\" the demon lord hissed through broken teeth, drawing my attention back to him. \"Better, you underestimate my power.\"\n With a horrible expression that I was sure was meant to be a smile, he disappeared, just turned to vapor and disappeared before our eyes. Christian sucked in a big breath and closed the two library doors, taking one of the broadswords and sliding it through the handles beneath the doorknobs.\n \"What are you doing that for?\"\n \"He has summoned his legions.\"\n I glanced back at the broken triumvirate. Tirana had a grip on Eduardo and was struggling with him. Guarda continued to stand blind, draining herself to feed Eduardo.\n Christian plucked the second broadsword from the wall, weighing it in his hand. \"Can you take care of them?\"\n I blinked. \"Yeah, no problem. Um, what legions? Why are you standing like that Highlander guy in front of the doors? What - \"\n Something huge crashed into the door, cracking one panel. An unearthly wail rose from outside, a wail that Tirana matched inside the room. I slapped my hands over my ears and watched as Christian braced himself, his sword held in both hands as the doors were battered down before us.\n I really was getting tired of demons.\n A hand clamped down on my shoulder, yanking me backward as Christian swung at the first demon through the door. Guarda wasn\u0027t blind now, although fury and hate twisted her features until they were almost unrecognizable. She spat out something at me in German, clawing at my hand until I realized she was trying to get Asmodeus\u0027s ring that I still held.\n \"I\u0027ve had just about enough of you and your obnoxious little gang,\" I yelled at her as I pried her fingers off my hand. I stomped down hard on her foot, jerking my hand free, clearing my mind, and preparing to blast Guarda and Eduardo out of the house and down the street.\n My brain gave a little whimper and shut down, leaving me standing cold and helpless, without a single wisp of power to aid me.\n \"Oh, crap,\" I said just before Guarda sprang at me. I panicked, leaping aside, almost directly into the path of a demon that was attacking Christian, but stumbled over the carcass of one of its fallen kin, slipping on the slick, black demon blood and falling painfully to my knees. Above me, the broadsword sang as Christian yelled for me to get behind him. A small, particularly ugly demon lunged at me as I scrambled back, for once not about to lecture Christian about his protective nature. Guarda turned from where she was trying to pull Tirana off Eduardo, and threw herself over the body of a demon toward me. I reached for Christian, intent on merging with him to tap into our joined power so I could disable Guarda and Eduardo, but the second my mind merged with his I realized just what Asmodeus had meant.\n We have to get out of here, I yelled into Christian\u0027s head as he gutted an elongated demon with one stroke, decapitating another on the return swing. You\u0027re almost out of power and I burned up all my circuits. There\u0027s no way we can fight off everyone.\n Guarda jumped onto my back, screaming in my ear. I threw myself backward, slamming her into the marble mantelpiece over the fireplace, grabbing one of the daggers and slashing at the arm she held around my throat. She shrieked and released me.\n If we leave now, Asmodeus will allow the demons to run free in London. They will kill and destroy as they hunt us, Christian said into my mind. I knew he was almost at the end of our Joined strength, knew also that he had been drained of blood earlier, so he was running on empty now. The power I\u0027d felt in our Joining was the last of his reserves, not the glorious, endless wellspring I\u0027d assumed it was.\n Tirana flew past me and crashed into a wall, but was instantly on its feet, its curls standing out in a golden halo around its cherub face adorned by a snarling mouth and sharp, pointed teeth. It screamed a warning of vengeance and threw itself back onto Eduardo, knocking Guarda down in the process. I used the moment of respite to consider our options.\n Downstairs, the room they built to hold Sebastian. He said it was specially constructed, warded, protected to keep him inside. We can use that as a bunker, turn the wards to protect us.\n No. I will not go there again. He staggered slightly to one side as a demon flung itself at him, shredding his shirt and leaving a trail of blood across his chest.\n We have to. It\u0027s that or die here. I felt his indecision, felt his horror of the place, and knew then that he must have been locked in it during the hours of the day I was dealing with other matters. I\u0027m sorry, my love, but we have to go there. I need quiet to see what remains of my abilities, to assess the damage, and you need blood.\n I kicked at a demon that reached for me, stumbling backward when Christian beat the creature off, then turned and thrust his sword downward, throwing the last of his power into the stroke. The carpet beneath my feet caved in, taking Christian and me with it as we fell to the stone floor below. A startled demon peered down at us from the gaping hole in the library floor.\n Quickly, Beloved. This way.\n I took the hand Christian offered and allowed him to heft me to my feet. My bad leg buckled under me, but Christian\u0027s hand was strong, his fingers warm around mine as he swung me up onto his shoulder, the broadsword still in his left hand as he kicked debris out of his way and raced for the vault.\n Demons poured down into the hole after us, terrible, tortured shrieks following them that told me the demons weren\u0027t too choosy about who they attacked. It was difficult to summon up much pity for any of the triumvirate, so instead I yelled at Christian to go faster, waving my fists at the demons that scrambled after us.\n The door to the vault was metal, just as Sebastian had said, inscribed with wards of containment. The wards were broken now, but still etched into the steel, their presence a testament to the pain of the men who had been held inside.\n \"Can you ward it?\" Christian asked, his back to me as he waved the sword at the oncoming demons.\n I tried clearing my mind and gathering strength to draw a ward, but there was nothing there. The ward would not draw.\n \"No,\" I cried, sick with the knowledge that I had lost it all, lost all my abilities.\n He slashed at the nearest demon, driving it back, then yanked open the door and shoved me inside, slamming the door behind us.\n \"Is there a lock?\" I asked as he threw himself against the door to keep the demons from opening it.\n \"Not on this side.\"\n \"Poop.\"\n \"A very polite way of expressing it, but certainly appropriate.\"\n \"What are we going to do?\"\n The sound of a bolt being thrown home outside the door and gales of demonic laughter answered the question.\n \"It would appear our problem is solved, at least until one of the demons realizes that although we cannot get out, they cannot get in,\" Christian observed wryly as he eased himself away from the door, prepared for it to spring open.\n It stayed locked.\n I looked around the small, lead-lined room and felt the hair on the back of my neck rise. In a corner stood a metal table, confinement straps dangling over the sides. It wasn\u0027t the table that was so horrible; it was the imprinted fear and anger and pain that clung to it that had me clutching Christian.\n \"Did they do something to you there? Did they torture you there?\"\n He said nothing but his eyes darkened. I leaned into him, merging my mind with his, reading there all that he had suffered as Eduardo had drained his blood from him, gloating over Christian, taunting him, tormenting him with the knowledge that he could not save me.\n But you did, I told him as I rained kisses down on his face. You saved us both; I see that now. I didn\u0027t understand at first, but now I know why you gave yourself over to Asmodeus. You knew it was the only way to make him believe I would not sacrifice myself for you.\n He stood passive for a moment, taking my love, letting it seep into the parched corners of his soul; then his hands were on me, fitting me tightly against his body, his lips searching out mine as I welcomed him into my body, my heart, my being. His tongue teased mine, tasting me, remembering me, immediately going into an arrogant, ordering-my-tongue-around mode that melted me against him.\n \"How long do you think they\u0027ll keep us locked in here before they figure it out?\" I asked breathlessly.\n He started backing me toward the far wall. \"Long enough,\" he answered, nuzzling my neck. I let my legs go all boneless, running my fingers through his long, silky hair...\n \"Drat.\" I unclenched my hand in order to use both hands on Christian. A small, metallic ping sounded just as I was about to kiss him until his fangs rattled. We both stopped and looked at the gold ring on the floor.\n Christian stilled, his arm tense beneath my hand. I blinked, rather stupidly, I admit, but hey, I\u0027d been through a lot. I was allowed to blink stupidly if I felt like it.\n \"Is that what I think it is?\"\n I nodded, staring at it, still blinking. Stupidly.\n \"Asmodeus\u0027s ring. How did you get it?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. It just suddenly came off his hand when I was trying to stop him from strangling me. I forgot I had it.\"\n Christian looked at me. I looked at him. Not stupidly, but with growing dismay. \"I can\u0027t, Christian. I can\u0027t.\"\n \"It\u0027s a personal item, a talisman of power. Why can\u0027t you?\"\n There was nowhere to sit but the floor, so I sank down onto the cold stainless-steel floor next to the ring and wrapped my arms around my legs. I\u0027d have to tell him; he would know the next time we merged. \"I fried my brain when I attacked the triumvirate. I tried, I really tried to deal with Eduardo, but it\u0027s gone, it\u0027s just gone, I can\u0027t do magic anymore. I couldn\u0027t even ward the door, and even a child can draw wards.\"\n Christian squatted next to me, his hands warm on my shoulders as he turned me to face him. \"Allegra, you haven\u0027t fried your brain. You\u0027ve drained yourself, yes, but you haven\u0027t permanently damaged yourself. You can\u0027t; you are my Beloved. You are immortal now.\"\n \"If I\u0027m so immortal, why does my leg still hurt? And I bet you my eyes haven\u0027t changed.\"\n \"Being granted immortality does not mean your physical flaws are obliterated.\"\n \"It\u0027s also no guarantee of the quality of brainpower. Part of my brain is dead, Christian, the good part, the only part of value. Now all I have left worth anything is my blood.\"\n His fingers brushed a strand of hair out of my face with a gesture so tender it made tears come to my eyes. \"Do you honestly believe that I would pick a woman who had nothing to offer me but a means of sustenance?\"\n \"You\u0027re just trying to be nice and make me feel better,\" I accused. \"You\u0027re going to say something sweet and endearing and wonderful that will melt my heart and make me see things that I\u0027m too stupid to see now, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes,\" he said, then tilted my chin up and kissed me. Tell me who you are.\n \"Allegra Telford,\" I said, obstinately refusing to give in to the intimacy he wanted from me.\n That is your name; who are you?\n \"Your Beloved.\"\n That is what you are; who are you?\n \"Someone who appreciates you in bed.\"\n Allegra, he sighed into my mind.\n \"Oh, all right. I\u0027m a Summoner. Or at least, I used to be before I burned up my Summoning equipment trying to overcome Eduardo.\"\n And did you overcome him?\n \"No.\"\n Is he here now?\n \"No, the demons got him. I\u0027m assuming they did; I doubt if anyone could have survived the horde that Asmodeus called up.\"\n Then you overcame him.\n \"Indirectly, maybe. Hey, are you supposed to be nibbling on my neck while you\u0027re grilling me?\"\n I can do anything I wish to do. I am a Moravian Dark One.\n I waited for the other shoe to drop.\n And you are my Beloved.\n By which, I assume you\u0027re implying I too can do anything I want?\n His fingers slid up the curve of my waist to cup my breasts. Anything, he breathed into my mind as I turned my head and found his mouth.\n You have to feed. You are weak, and we need your strength right now. Blood is all I can offer you; please take it.\n His tongue was fire in my mouth. The flames licked down my chest, filling me with need and hunger. You have so much more to offer, Beloved. I believe in you. I believe you can do anything you desire.\n He merged with me then, his thoughts filling my head, my soul cleansing his, our hearts beating in time. His faith glowed bright, absolute faith in me, in my abilities, in us. I smiled as I kissed him, tears streaking my cheeks even as I slid my arms around him, his strength no threat to me, but an aid, a protection, a part of my life that I knew I wouldn\u0027t want to be without.\n He pulled my hand forward and pressed the ring into it. Do it, Beloved.\n I stared at it, doubt tugging at me.\n I know you can.\n The underlying power in magic, as I have said before, comes from the belief of the practitioner in her own abilities. If you don\u0027t believe, the magic won\u0027t work. I looked from the ring to Christian\u0027s eyes, those beautiful dark eyes that now were smiling at me, full of love and pride and quiet expectation that made warmth bloom inside me again.\n \"Will you still love me if I fail?\"\n \"I will always love you, no matter what you do.\"\n I held on to the belief he poured into my mind as I set the ring down onto the floor, patting my jeans until I pulled a crumbled piece of chalk from my hip pocket. Christian\u0027s hand rested warm and solid on my back, a reminder that I was not alone as I drew the circle. It was odd, this knowledge that I could be myself, be everything I had fought for, and still be a part of Christian, but I had no more time for introspection and other mushy types of thought, no matter how enticing they were.\n I had a demon lord to send back to hell.\n \"Why is it never easy with you? Why must you insist on making even the simplest of matters difficult?\"\n A dull thud from the door reverberated around the small, soundproofed room.\n I\u0027m not being difficult; I\u0027m being practical. Now bite me!\n \"I do not need to feed.\"\n The door shuddered as another thud, louder this time, echoed into the room. The sword Christian had wedged into the door frame clattered against the metal, giving warning it was about to be dislodged.\n Yes, you do. They drained you; I can feel how weak you are. Drink!\n \"I will not take from you when you need all your strength.\"\n I\u0027m not so hung up on my own independence that I don\u0027t realize that your strength is an integral part of mine, Christian. Either you drink my blood this very minute, or I won\u0027t do a thing about closing this circle. I figure those demons are going to break through in about five seconds, so either you bite me now, or forever hold your peace.\n His fangs pierced the hollow of my throat, sharp needles of pain dissolving into a sensation of intimate ecstasy. He drank deeply, making my head spin with both the pleasure of his feeding and the power that surged through him as my blood gave him new life. The door shuddered, thought about giving, but changed its mind at the last minute and held solid once again. I knew the next blow the demons made would destroy it. It was now or never; either I believed in myself, or I didn\u0027t.\n I turned my head and bit Christian\u0027s thumb, squeezing his finger over the circle until three drops of dark red blood landed next to Asmodeus\u0027s ring. Christian\u0027s tongue was warm on my neck; then he pulled away. I wiped the smear of red from his lips, using my blood to trace a binding symbol in the middle of the circle, my finger tingling with the familiar sensation of power.\n \"Asmodeus, sixty-seventh spirit of Goeth, commander of the thirty legions, I Summon thee by the power of thy own talisman. Come forth and be bound under my hand.\"\n The demons were gathering for another assault on the door; I could feel their intentions pounding against us. Christian stood and prepared to defend me.\n Belief is everything. I rose to my feet, grimly tracing protection wards around us, daring them to defy me. The wards allowed themselves to be drawn, wavered, then glowed red as power began to grow within me.\n \"Asmodeus, sixty-seventh spirit of Goeth, commander of the thirty legions, I command thee to appear before me!\"\n The demons slammed through the door as Asmodeus snarled into view, confined to the circle, held only by a few drops of blood and the combined belief Christian and I shared in my abilities. The demons stopped, unable to move so long as their master was bound by the circle.\n \"You do not have the power,\" the demon lord said with a sneer, his ravaged frame growing until it seemed to fill the room. \"You cannot hold me, for I am all-powerful.\"\n Christian stood before the demons, his belief in me flooding my mind, turning to power as we merged together, one will, one mind, one spirit. \"Asmodeus, sixty-seventh spirit of Goeth, commander of the thirty legions, bend thee to my command!\"\n \"You will not triumph over me! You are not strong enough to - \"\n \"Asmodeus!\" My voice cut through the demon lord\u0027s roars with the clarity of a bell, echoing throughout the room, sending the demons into a shrieking fit of cowering. Asmodeus twisted his body upon itself. I took a deep breath, throwing everything I had into the last few words. \"Asmodeus, I return thee to the pit that spawned you!\"\n With a scream that shook the house to its foundations, Asmodeus turned into oily red smoke that hung in the air for a moment before slowly dissolving into nothing.\n The demons left nasty little black marks on the floor as they disappeared with Asmodeus, dragged back to the infernal depths with their master.\n Christian grabbed my hand and hauled me forward.\n \"Wait, the ring - \"\n \"Leave it. The house is coming down.\"\n He was right. The house, which shook as we sent Asmodeus back to hell, continued to shake and rumble above our heads. Loud crashes and ominous cracks from overhead had us racing down the small passageway, Christian more or less dragging me up the stairs to the kitchen. We made it through the back door just as the second floor crashed down onto the first, which sent it down onto the ground floor, and that to the basement. I clung to Christian, his hand holding my face against his chest as wood and glass and debris flew around us as the house came down.\n I wrapped my arms around him, holding him tight as we stood in the garden and stared at the remains of the Trust house. We said nothing. There was nothing to say. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-and-the-single-vampire-dark-ones-2/page-19.html","bookId":2203,"book":{"id":2203,"title":"Sex and the Single Vampire (Dark Ones #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Sex and the Single Vampire (Dark Ones, #2) \n If Allie doesn\u0027t find a ghost soon, her short career as a \"Summoner\" with United Psychical Research Association will be a thing of the past, so naturally she is delighted to find what she thinks is the tortured spirit of a gorgeous, naked, wounded man.
