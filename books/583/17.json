{"id":22174,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17 Ithaca","content":"WHAT PARALLEL COURSES DID BLOOM AND STEPHEN FOLLOW REturning? \n Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner\u0027s place by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George\u0027s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary? \n \n Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the male-cent influence of the presabbath, Stephen\u0027s collapse. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience? \n \n Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Were their views on some points divergent? \n \n Stephen dissented openly from Bloom\u0027s view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen\u0027s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen\u0027s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman\u0027s hand. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative? \n \n The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past? \n \n In 1884 with Ower Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard\u0027s corner and Leonard\u0027s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon\u0027s house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom\u0027s) house in Lombard street, west. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination? \n \n He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n As in what ways? \n \n From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination? \n \n At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was it there? \n \n It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why was he doubly irritated? \n \n Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple? \n \n To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Bloom\u0027s decision? \n \n A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did he fall? \n \n By his body\u0027s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Fraedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the Christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number $, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, MXMIV. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did he rise uninjured by concussion? \n \n Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a Lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive? \n \n Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 C P, a man lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of ICP. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did the man reappear elsewhere? \n \n Alter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did Stephen obey his sign? \n \n Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man\u0027s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom\u0027s house. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What did Bloom do? \n \n He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M\u0027Donald of 14 D\u0027Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think? \n \n Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher\u0027s Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics\u0027 theatre of university College, 16 Stephen\u0027s green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father\u0027s house in Cabra. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall? \n \n Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies\u0027 grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What did Bloom see on the range? \n \n On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What did Bloom do at the range? \n \n He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did it flow? \n \n Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2,400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of #5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee, had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire? \n \n Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator\u0027s projection: its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: Its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap? \n \n To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington\u0027s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom\u0027s offer? \n \n That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach, and thenar or sole of foot? \n \n The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius. \n \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress? \n \n Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest? \n \n Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire? \n \n The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise I pound of water from 50 to 212 Fahrenheit. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature? \n \n A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously. \n \n For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled? \n \n To shave himself. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What advantages attended shaving by night? \n \n A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman\u0027s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises \n \n Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence? \n \n The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by Bloom? \n \n On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, and open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree\u0027s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co\u0027s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps\u0027s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch\u0027s choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy\u0027s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom\u0027s and Mrs Fleming\u0027s breakfasts made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser? \n \n Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 887, 886. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow? \n \n Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman\u0027s shelter, at Butt bridge. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him? \n \n In Bernard Kiernan\u0027s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in David Byrne\u0027s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O\u0027Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon\u0027s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited) dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman\u0027s Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations? \n \n The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n His mood? \n \n He hid not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What satisfied him? \n \n To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile? \n \n He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps\u0027s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest? \n \n Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality? \n \n His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps\u0027s massproduct, the creature cocoa. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun? \n \n The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest\u0027s jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady\u0027s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Who drank more quickly? \n \n Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent\u0027s one, six to two, nine to three. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act? \n \n Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Had he found their solution? \n \n In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing on all points. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the Shamrock, a weekly newspaper? \n \n An ambition to squint \n At my verses in print \n Makes me hope that for these you\u0027ll find room. \n If you so condescend \n Then please place at the end \n The name of yours truly, L. Bloom. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him? \n \n Name, age, race, creed. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What anagrams had he made on his name in youth? \n \n Leopold Bloom \n \n Ellpodbomool \n \n Molldopeloob. \n \n Bollo edoom \n \n Old Ollebo, M. P. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888? \n \n Poets oft have sung in rhyme \n Of music sweet their praise divine. \n Let them hymn it nine times nine. \n Bearer far than song or wine, \n You are mine. The world is mine. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual years, entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan, produced by R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist principal girl? \n \n Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist\u0027s non-intellectual, non-political, nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist\u0027s revelations of white articles of nonintellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from Everybody\u0027s Book of Jokes (1,000 pages and a laugh in every one); sixthly, the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What relation existed between their ages? \n \n 16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen\u0027s present age Stephen was 6.16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom\u0027s present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What events might nullify these calculations? \n \n The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance? \n \n Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon\u0027s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen\u0027s mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin\u0027s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen\u0027s father and Stephen\u0027s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father? \n \n Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them? \n \n Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen\u0027s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O\u0027Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her? \n \n He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low\u0027s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity? \n \n Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased? \n \n The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositions wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable? \n \n The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow\u0027s Physical Strength and How To Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Had any special agility been his in earlier youth? \n \n Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did either openly allude to their racial difference? \n \n Neither. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom\u0027s thoughts about Stephen\u0027s thoughts about Bloom and Bloom\u0027s thoughts about Stephen\u0027s thoughts about Bloom\u0027s thoughts about Stephen? \n \n He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages? \n \n Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty); Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman? \n \n Bloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A. alone in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe; by James O\u0027Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords; and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did they find their educational careers similar? \n \n Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame\u0027s school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree course of the royal university. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life? \n \n Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What two temperaments did they individually represent? \n \n The scientific. The artistic. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science? \n \n Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten? \n \n Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playingballs, historically costumed dolls. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What also stimulated him in his cogitations? \n \n The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George\u0027s street, South, the latter at his 6 1/2d. shop and world\u0027s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d., children 1d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Such as? \n \n K. 11.

Keyes. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Such as not? \n \n Look at this long candle.

Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree is a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Montpat. Plamtroo. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success? \n \n His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen? \n \n Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What? \n \n In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen\u0027s hotel, Queen\u0027s hotel, Queen\u0027s Ho... \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom? \n \n The Queen\u0027s Hotel, Ennis, County, Glare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition? \n \n Coincidence. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see? \n \n He preferred himself to see another\u0027s face and listen to another\u0027s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums? \n \n It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon\u0027s Studies in Blue, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlict, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind? \n \n What to do with our wives. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What had been his hypothetical singular solutions? \n \n Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spillikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution? \n \n In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things? \n \n The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance? \n \n Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other\u0027s ignorant lapse. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n With what success had he attempted direct instruction? \n \n She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest, comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What system had proved more effective? \n \n Indirect suggestion implicating self-interest. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Example? \n \n She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Accepting the analogy implied in his guest\u0027s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce? \n \n Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of More Neubkim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen? \n \n That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned? \n \n Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest? \n \n By Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus, suil go cuin (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care). \n \n By Bloom: Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m\u0027baad l\u0027zamatejch (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison? \n \n On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entitled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1,4 and 100. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical? \n \n Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them? \n \n The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary\u0027s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve\u0027s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and Jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreductible consummation? \n \n Kolod balejwaw pnimali \n Nefesch, jehudi, homijah. \n Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich? \n In consequence of defective mnemotechnic. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? By a periphrastic version of the general text. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n In what common study did their mutual reflections merge? \n \n The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did the guest comply with his host\u0027s request? \n \n Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What was Stephen\u0027s auditive sensation? \n \n He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What was Bloom\u0027s visual sensation? \n \n He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What were Stephen\u0027s and Bloom\u0027s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities? \n \n Visually, Stephen\u0027s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair. \n \n Auditively, Bloom\u0027s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars? \n \n In the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.C., Rufus Isaacs, K.C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle (1901), exponent of Shakespeare. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme? \n \n Reassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend? \n \n d Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball \n And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played \n He drove it o\u0027er the jew\u0027s garden wall. \n And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played \n He broke the jew\u0027s windows all. \n How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part? \n With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Recite the second part (minor) of the legend. \n \n Then out there came the jew\u0027s daughter \n And she all dressed in green. \n `Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, \n And play your ball again.\u0027 \n `I can\u0027t come back and I won\u0027t come back \n Without my schoolfellows all, \n For if my master he did hear \n He\u0027d make it a sorry ball.\u0027 \n \n She took him by the lilywhite hand \n And led him along the hall \n Until she led him to a room \n Where none could hear him call. \n \n She took a penknife out of her pocket \n And cut off his little head, \n And now he\u0027ll play his ball no more \n For he lies among the dead. \n \n How did the father of Millicent receive this second part? \n With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew\u0027s daughter, all dressed in green. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Condense Stephen\u0027s commentary. \n One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why was the host (victim predestined) sad? \n \n He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still? \n \n In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why was the host (secret infidel) silent? \n \n He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune? \n \n From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated in night attire had lain, sleeping. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family? \n \n Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What other infantile memories had he of her? \n \n 15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What endemic characteristics were present? \n \n Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What memories had he of her adolescence? \n \n She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke\u0027s lawn entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him? \n \n Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently? \n \n A temporary departure of his cat. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why similarly, why differently? \n \n Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n In other respects were their differences similar? \n \n In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n As? \n \n Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen\u0027s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n In what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her? \n \n As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n In what manners did she reciprocate? \n \n She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist? \n \n To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such extemporisation? \n \n For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew\u0027s daughter? \n \n Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer? \n \n If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host? \n \n A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus, born Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was the proposal of asylum accepted? \n \n Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What exchange of money took place between host and guest? \n \n The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (?1.7s.0.), one pound seven shillings, advanced by the latter to the former. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed? \n \n To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions? \n \n The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler\u0027s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown\u0027s) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2s.) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was the clown Bloom\u0027s son? \n \n No. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Had Bloom\u0027s coin returned? \n \n Never. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him? \n \n Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions? \n \n There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why did he desist from speculation? \n \n Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did Stephen participate in his dejection? \n \n He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro- and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom? \n \n Not verbally. Substantially. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What comforted his misapprehension? \n \n That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n I n what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected? \n \n Lighted Candle in Stick borne by \n BLOOM. \n Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by \n STEPHEN. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm? \n \n The 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Isra?l de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What did each do at the door of egress? \n \n Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress? \n \n For a cat. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden? \n \n The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations? \n \n Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipent lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Major) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast? \n \n Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result? \n \n Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution? \n \n Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n And the problem of possible redemption? \n The minor was proved by the major. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered? \n \n The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner\u0027s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n His (Bloom\u0027s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error? \n \n That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositions probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its future spectators had entered actual present existence. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle? \n \n Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters? \n \n It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman? \n \n Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom\u0027s, who attracted Stephen\u0027s gaze? \n \n In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom\u0027s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O\u0027Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp? \n \n With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Boa then were silent? \n \n Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Were they indefinitely inactive? \n \n At Stephen\u0027s suggestion, at Bloom\u0027s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom\u0027s, then Stephen\u0027s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Similarly? \n \n The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom\u0027s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen\u0027s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other? \n \n To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed? \n \n A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer? \n \n By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation? \n \n Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands? \n \n The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard? \n \n By Stephen: \n \n Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet. \n Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat. \n By Bloom: \n Heigho, heigho, \n Heigho, heigho. \n Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north? \n Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Alone, what did Bloom hear? \n \n The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew\u0027s harp in the resonant lane. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Alone, what did Bloom feel? \n \n The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him? \n \n Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordi\u0026Aelig; hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain? \n \n The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of day-break, the apparition of a new solar disk. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena? \n \n Once, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n He remembered the initial paraphenomena? \n \n More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Did he remain? \n \n With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What suddenly arrested his ingress? \n \n The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furnitures? \n \n A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Describe them. \n \n One: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What significances attached to these two chairs? \n \n Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard? \n \n A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies\u0027 gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love\u0027s Old Sweet Song (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained, pedal, ritirando, close. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects? \n \n With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focusing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan\u0027s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n His next proceeding? \n \n From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What followed this operation? \n \n That truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece? \n \n A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom? \n \n In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention? \n \n The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why solitary (ipsorelative)? \n \n Brothers and sisters had he none, \n Yet that man\u0027s father was his grandfather\u0027s son. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why mutable (aliorelative)? \n \n From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror? \n \n The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite. \n \n Catalogue these books. \n Thorn\u0027s Dublin Post Office Directory, 1886. \n \n Denis Florence M\u0027Carthy\u0027s Poetical Works (copper beechleaf bookmark at p. 5). \n \n Shakespeare\u0027s Works (dark crimson morocco, goldtooled). \n \n The Useful Ready Reckoner (brown cloth). \n \n The Secret History of the Court of Charles II (red cloth, tooled binding). \n \n The Child\u0027s Guide (blue cloth). \n \n When We Were Boys by William O\u0027Brien M.P.

A. Wren, 9 Bachelor\u0027s Walk. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What caused him irritation in his sitting posture? \n \n Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How was the irritation allayed? \n \n He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hair extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebr\u0026Aelig;, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What involuntary actions followed? \n \n He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin.

\n \n Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why with satisfaction? \n \n Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other unguinal fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis\u0027s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions now coalesced?

When countrybound velocipedes, a chainless freewheel roadster cycle with side basketcar attached, or draught conveyance, a donkey with wicker trap or smart phaeton with good working solidungular cob (roan gelding, 14h). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What might be the name of this erigible or erected residence? \n \n Bloom Cottage. Saint Leopold\u0027s. Flowerville. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville? \n \n In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving longevity. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible? \n \n Snapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the celestial constellations. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What lighter recreations? \n \n Outdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways, ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation), vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers\u0027 fires of smoking peat turves (period of hibernation).

P., P. C., K. P., L. L. D. honoris cause, Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown for England). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity? \n \n A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth. \n \n To master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in The Descent of Man and The Origin of Species. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O\u0027Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for Midlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2,000 torches in escort of the marquess of Ripon and John Morley. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence? \n \n As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum of #60 per annum, being 116th of an assured income, derived from giltedged securities, representing at 5% simple interest on capital of #1,200 (estimate of price at 20 years purchase) of which 1/3rd to be paid on acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. #800 plus 2 1/2% interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of #64, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession of the lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale, foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the absolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of years stipulated. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate purchase? \n \n A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr. 8 m. p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time) the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time). The unexpected discovery of an object of great monetary value: precious stone, valuable adhesive or impressed postage stamps (7-shilling, mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866: 4 pence, rose, blue paper perforate, Great Britain, 1866: 1 franc, stone, official, rouletted, diagonal surcharge, Luxembourg, 1878): antique dynastical ring, unique relic in unusual repositories or by unusual means: from the air (dropped by an eagle in flight), by fire (amid the carbonised remains of an incendiated edifice), in the sea (amid flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict), on earth (in the gizzard of a comestible fowl). A Spanish prisoner\u0027s donation of a distant treasure of valuables or specie or bullion lodged with a solvent banking corporation 100 years previously at 5% compound interest of the collective worth of #5,000,000 stg (five million pounds sterling). A contract with an inconsiderate contractee for the delivery of 32 consignments of some given commodity in consideration of cash payment on delivery at the initial rate of 1/4d. to be increased constantly in the geometrical progression of 2 (1/4d., 1/2d., 1d., 2d., 4d., 8d., 1s. 4d., 2s. 8d. to 32 terms). A prepared scheme based on a study of the laws of probability to break the bank at Monte Carlo. A solution of the secular problem of the quadrature of the circle, government premium #1,000,000 sterling. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was vast wealth acquirable through industrial channels? \n \n The reclamation of dunams of waste arenary soil, proposed in the prospectus of Agendath Netaim, Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W.15 by the cultivation of orange plantations and melonfields and reafforestation. The utilisation of waste paper, fells of sewer rodents, human excrement possessing chemical properties, in view of the vast production of the first, vast number of the second and immense quantity of the third, every normal human being of average vitality and appetite producing annually, cancelling byproducts of water, a sum total of 80 lbs. (mixed animal and vegetable diet), to be multiplied by 4,386,035 the total population of Ireland according to the census returns of 1901. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Were there schemes of wider scope? \n \n A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power), obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main streams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity. A scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the North Bull at Dollymount and erect on the space of the foreland, used for golf links and rifle ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths, shooting galleries, hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for mixed bathing. A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early morning milk. A scheme for the development of Irish tourist traffic in and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats, plying in the fluvial fairway between island bridge and Ringsend, charabancs, narrow gauge local railways, and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation (10/- per person per day, guide (trilingual) included). A scheme for the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways, when freed from weedbeds. A scheme to connect by tramline the Cattle Market (North Circular road and Prussia street) with the quays (Sheriff street, lower, and East Wall), parallel with the Link line railway laid (in conjunction with the Great Southern and Western railway line) between the cattle park, Liffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great Western railway 43 to 45 North Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of Great Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam Packet Company, Lancashire Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and Glasgow Steam Packet Company, Glasgow Dublin and Londonderry Steam Packet Company (Laird line), British and Irish Steam Packet Company, Dublin and Morecambe Steamers, London and North Western Railway Company, Dublin Port and Docks Board Landing Sheds and transit sheds of Palgrave, Murphy and Company, steamship owners, agents for steamers from Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Holland and for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the Dublin United Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers\u0027 fees. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes become a natural and necessary apodosis? \n \n Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift and transfer vouchers during donor\u0027s lifetime or by bequest after donor\u0027s painless extinction, of eminent financiery (Blum Pasha, Rothschild, Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller) possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What eventually would render him independent of such wealth? \n \n The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation? \n \n It was one or his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n His justifications? \n \n As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at least 2/7ths, viz., 20 years passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person\u0027s desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What did he fear? \n \n The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What were habitually his final meditations? \n \n Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What did the first drawer unlocked contain? \n \n A Vere Foster\u0027s handwriting copybook, property of Milly (Millicent) Bloom, certain pages of which bore diagram drawings marked Papli, which showed a large globular head with 5 hairs erect, 2 eyes in profile, the trunk full front with 3 large buttons, 1 triangular foot: 2 fading photographs of queen Alexandra of England and of Maud Branscombe, actress and professional beauty: a Yuletide card, bearing on it a pictorial representation of a parasitic plant, the legend Mizpah, the date Xmas 1892, the name of the senders, from Mr and Mrs M.

Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener? \n \n In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant product$ of amnesia? \n \n Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper. \n \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent? \n \n The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences? \n \n The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity. \n \n Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s. 4d. in the #, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff\u0027s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man\u0027s House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson\u0027s Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n With which attendant indignities? \n \n The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing or less than nothing. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n By what could such a situation be precluded? \n \n By decease (change of state), by departure (change of place). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Which preferably? \n \n The latter, by the line of least resistance. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable? \n \n Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What considerations rendered it not irrational? \n \n The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What considerations rendered it desirable? \n \n The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n In Ireland? \n \n The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant\u0027s Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid\u0027s elm in Kildare, the Queen\u0027s Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Abroad? \n \n Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues, nude Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O\u0027Hara of the camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Under what guidance, following what signs? \n \n At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Major produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Major. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed? \n \n #5 reward lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity? \n \n Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What tributes his? \n \n Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear? \n \n Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or of the silver King. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What would render such return irrational? \n \n An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable? \n \n The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed? \n \n The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate? \n \n The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and Thummin): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchizedek): the visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford row, Merchants\u0027 Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan\u0027s premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman\u0027s shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend? \n \n The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend? \n \n Who was M\u0027Intosh? \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend? \n \n Where was Moses when the candle went out? \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, silently, successively, enumerate? \n \n A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement, to obtain a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 5 Dame street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C.), to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female divinities, to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandman Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49, South King street. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall? \n \n The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin\u0027s Barn. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by the hypothesis? \n \n Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him? \n \n A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies\u0027 hose, a pair of new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies\u0027 drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti\u0027s Turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of baptiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What impersonal objects were perceived? \n \n A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady\u0027s black straw hat. Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor, and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Bloom\u0027s acts? \n \n He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How? \n \n With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adder: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter? \n \n New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n If he had smiled why would he have smiled? \n \n To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone, whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating In and repeated to infinity. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What preceding series? \n \n Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d\u0027Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society\u0027s Horse Show, Maggot O\u0027Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to nolast term. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed? \n \n Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster). \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability? \n \n Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected? \n \n Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Envy? \n \n Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Jealousy? \n \n Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because action between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Abnegation? \n \n In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Equanimity? \n \n As natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king\u0027s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity? \n \n From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What retribution, if any? \n \n Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witness), not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting separator from both. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments? \n \n The preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female, the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge? \n \n Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n The visible signs of antesatisfaction? \n \n An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation; a silent contemplation. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Then? \n \n He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n The visible signs of postsatisfaction? \n \n A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What followed this silent action? \n \n Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation? \n \n Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandman Palmer of Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn\u0027s (Murphy\u0027s) Hotel, 35, 36, and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled Sweets of Sin, anonymous, author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications? \n \n Absolutely. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration? \n \n Stephen Dedalus, professor and author. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration? \n \n By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n How? \n \n By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n What moved visibly above the listener\u0027s and the narrator\u0027s invisible thoughts? \n \n The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n In what directions did listener and narrator lie? \n \n Listener, S. E. by E.; Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45? to the terrestrial equator. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n In what state of rest or motion? \n \n At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space. \n \n In what posture? \n \n Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Womb? Weary? \n \n He rests. He has travelled. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n With? \n \n Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and Binbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and Hinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n When? \n \n Going to a dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc\u0027s auk\u0027s egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the Brightdayler. \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Where? \n \n \n 归途，布卢姆和斯蒂芬肩并肩走的是哪条路线？ \n \n 他们都是用正常的步行速度从贝雷斯福德广场出发，按照下、中加德纳街的顺序走到蒙乔伊广场西端。随后放慢步伐一道向左拐，漫不经心地来到加德纳广场尽头，这里是通向北边坦普尔街的交叉口。随后朝右拐，时而停下脚步，缓慢地沿着但普尔街往北走去，一直来到哈德威克街[1] 。他们迈着悠闲的步子先后挨近了圣乔治教堂前的圆形广场，然后迳直穿过去。说起来，任何一个圆，其弦都比弧要短。 \n \n 一路上，二巨头究竟讨论了些什么？ \n \n 音乐，文学，爱尔兰，都柏林，巴黎，友情，女人，卖淫，营养，煤气灯、弧光灯以及白炽灯的光线对附近那些避日性树木的成长所产生的影响[ 2] ，市政府临时所设不加盖的垃圾箱，罗马天主教堂，圣职者的独身生活，爱尔兰国民，耶稣会的教育，职业，学医，刚度过的这一天，安息日[3] 前一天的不祥气氛，斯蒂芬晕倒一事。 \n \n 布卢姆可曾就他们二人各自对经验之反应的相同与不同之处发现类似的共同点？ \n \n 两个人都对艺术印象敏感，对音乐印象比对造型艺术或绘画艺术更要敏感。两人都对大陆的生活方式比对岛国的有所偏爱，又都情愿住在大西洋这边，并不愿住到大西洋彼岸去。早年的家庭教育与血统里带来的对异教的执拗反抗，使得二人态度顽强，对宗教、国家、社会、伦理等许许多多正统教义都抱有怀疑。两个人都认为异性吸引力具有相互刺激与抑制的作用。 \n \n 他们两人的见解在什么上头有些分歧呢？ \n \n 斯蒂芬毫不隐瞒他对布卢姆关于营养和市民自救行为的重要性持有异议；布卢姆则对斯蒂芬关于人类精神通过文学得到永恒的肯定这一见解，暗自表示不以为然。布卢姆倒是不动声色地同意了斯蒂芬所指出的爱尔兰国民放弃对德鲁伊特[4]的信仰而皈依基督教的时期在年份上的错误。应把李尔利王统治下，教皇切莱斯廷一世派遣帕特里克（奥德修斯之子波提图斯之子卡尔波努斯之子）前来的公元四三二年，更正为科麦克·麦克阿尔特（殁于公元二六六年）统治下的二六0 年或约莫那个时期，而科麦克是因被食物卡住而噎死于斯莱提，并埋葬在罗斯纳利的。布卢姆暗自同意斯蒂芬的论点。布卢姆认为斯蒂芬之所以晕倒乃是因为他胃囊里空空如也，以及搀水量与酒精度数各不相同的化合物在作怪。这是始而精神紧张，继而又在松弛的气氛下疾迅地旋转这一剧烈的运动所造成的。斯蒂芬却把它归因于起初还没有女人的巴掌那么大的晨云再次出现（他们二人曾从不同的地点--沙丘与都柏林，目击到那片云彩）[ 5] 。 \n \n 他们两个人可曾在某一点上持同样否定的见解？ \n \n 在煤气灯或电灯的光线对附近那些避日性树木的成长所产生的影响这一点上。 \n \n 过去夜间闲荡时，布卢姆可曾议论过同样一些问题？ \n \n 一八八四年，夜间他与欧文·戈德堡[6] 和塞西尔·特恩布尔一道沿着这几条大马路边走边谈：从朗伍德大街走到伦纳德街角，又从伦纳德街角走到辛格街，然后从辛格街走到布卢姆菲尔德大街。一八八五年的一个傍晚，他又与珀西·阿普约翰一道倚着厄珀克罗斯区克鲁姆林的直布罗陀庄与布卢姆菲尔德公馆之间的墙，交谈过几次。一八八六年，他与偶然结识者以及可能成为主顾的人 \n \n 1034在门口的台阶上、前客厅里和郊区铁路线的三等车厢里谈过。一八八八年，他经常与布赖恩·特威迪鼓手长和他的女儿玛莉恩·特威迪小姐，有时同父女一道，有时单独同其中的一个交谈，地点就在圆镇的马修·狄龙[7] 家的娱乐室里。一八九二年与朱利叶斯·马斯添斯基[ 8] 谈过一次，一八九三年又谈过一次，都是在西伦巴德街的（布卢姆）自己家的客厅里。 \n \n 在到达他们的目的地之前，关于一八八四、一八八五、一八八六、一八八八、一八九二、一八九三、一九0 四这一不规则的连续，布卢姆有过些什么样的反思？ \n \n 他反思道，个人的成长与经验积累的范围越是不断在扩大，伴随而来的就必然是各个人相互间交流范围缩小这一退步现象。 \n \n 例如在哪些方面？ \n \n 从不存在到存在。他出现在很多人面前，作为一个存在，被接受下来。就存在与存在的关系而言，他就像任何存在对任何存在那样对待任何存在。他即将从存在而消失到不存在中去，从而被所有的人看作是不存在的。 \n \n 他们抵达目的地之后，布卢姆采取了什么行动[9]？ \n \n 在等差奇数的第四位，也就是埃克尔斯街七号门口的台阶那儿，他把手机械地伸进长裤后兜里去掏他那把弹簧锁钥匙。 \n \n 在那儿吗？ \n \n 钥匙是在他仅仅一天之前穿过的那条长裤的同一位置的兜里。 \n \n 他为什么倍加气恼？ \n \n 因为他忘记了，而且又想起曾两次提醒过自己：可不要忘记。 \n \n 那么这两个（分别）故意地或粗心大意地未带钥匙的人，面临着什么样的选择呢？ \n \n 进去还是不进去。敲门还是不敲门[ 10] 。 \n \n 布卢姆是怎么决定的？ \n \n 一条计策。他把两只脚迈上矮墙，跨过地下室前那块空地的栏杆，将帽子紧紧扣在头上，摸住栅栏下部的两个格子，将他那具五英尺九英寸半的身躯徐徐地落下来，一直落到距地面不足两英尺十英寸的地方。然后撒开攥着栅栏的手，让身子在空中自由摇荡。为了减缓坠落时的冲击，他还把身子蜷缩起来。 \n \n 他坠落了吗？ \n \n 他是凭着常衡制十一斯通零六磅的体重坠落的。他所使用的是弗雷德里克街北区十九号的药剂师弗朗西斯·弗罗德曼的店铺内那台供定期测量体重的有刻度的自动磅秤。日期是耶稣升天的最后节日[11]，即闰年基督教公元一九0 四年（犹太历公元五六六四年，伊斯兰历公元一三二二年）五月十二日。金号码[12]五，闰余[13]十三，太阳活动周[14]九，主日字母[ 15]CB，罗马十五年历[ 16] 二，儒略周期[17]六六一七年，MCMIV[ 18] 。 \n \n 他没有受震伤就站起来了吗？ \n \n 他重新获得了稳定均衡，尽管因猛烈撞击而受震荡，却没有负外伤就站了起来。他使劲扳院门搭扣的那个活动金属片，凭着加在这一支轴上的初级杠杆的作用，把搭扣摘开，穿过紧挨着厨房地下的碗碟洗涤槽，绕道走进厨房。他擦着了一根安全火柴，转动煤气开关，放出可燃性的煤气。他调节那燃旺了的火焰，捻小成发白的文火为止。最后，点上一支便于携带的蜡烛。 \n \n 这当儿，斯蒂芬瞧见了哪些忽隐忽现的影象？ \n \n 他倚着地下室前那块空地的栅栏，隔着厨房里的透明窗玻璃，瞧见一个男人在调节十四烛光的煤气火焰，一个男人点燃一烛光的蜡烛，一个男人轮流脱着一双靴子，一个男人拿着蜡烛正在从厨房里走出来。 \n \n 那个男人先前可曾在别处出现过？ \n \n 过了四分钟，隔着厅门上端那半透明的扇形气窗，他那忽隐忽现的烛光映入眼帘。厅门徐徐地随着铰链转动着。那个男人手持蜡烛，没戴帽子，重新出现在空荡荡的门道里。 \n \n 斯蒂芬听他用手势来指挥了吗？ \n \n 是的，他静悄悄地走了进去，帮助把门关严，挂上链子，静悄悄地跟在那个男子背后，脚上跋拉着用布边做的拖鞋，手待点燃的蜡烛，打左边那扇从缝儿里露出灯光来的门前经过，小心翼翼地走下不只五个阶磴的螺旋梯，来到布卢姆家的厨房。 \n \n 布卢姆做了些什么？ \n \n 他猛地朝火苗吹去，把蜡烛熄灭。将两把匙形木椅拖到炉边，一把是给斯蒂芬准备的，椅背朝着面临院子的窗户，一把是自己坐的。他单膝着地，往炉格子里放了些粘着树脂的枝条和五颜六色的纸张，以及从坐落于多利埃街十四号的弗罗尔与麦唐纳公司的堆置场以每吨二十一先令的代价买来的优质阿布拉莫木炭。他把这些都十字交叉地堆成不规则的多角形，划了一根安全火柴，在纸张的三个角落点上火。这样，燃料里的碳和氢这两种元素就与空气中的氧气自由化合，散发出潜在的能量。 \n \n 斯蒂芬的头脑里浮现出什么样类似的幻影呢？ \n \n 他联想到旁的时候在旁的地方跪着单膝或双膝曾经替他生火的其他那些人；迈克尔修士，在坐落于基尔代尔郡塞林斯的耶稣会克朗戈伍斯公学校医院的病房里[19]。他父亲西蒙·迪达勒斯，在菲茨吉本街门牌十五号那间没有家具等设备的屋子里[ 20]，而那是他在都柏林的头一个住所。他的教母凯特·莫坎小姐--住在厄谢尔岛她那奄奄一息的姐姐朱莉姬·莫坎小姐家[ 21]里。他的舅妈萨拉--里奇（理查德）·古尔丁的妻子，在他们那坐落于克兰布拉西尔街门牌六十二号寓所的厨房里。他的母亲玛丽--西蒙·迪达勒斯的妻子，那是在北里奇蒙街门牌十二号的厨房里，时间是一八九八年圣方济各·沙勿略节日的早晨[22]。副教导主任巴特神父，在“斯蒂芬草地”北区门牌十六号的大学物理实验室[23]里。他的妹妹迪丽（迪丽姬），在他父亲那坐落于卡布拉的家里[24]。 \n \n 斯蒂芬把视线从壁炉往上移到对面墙上一码高的地方。他望到了什么？那是一排五个家用螺形弹簧按铃，下面，在烟囱那凹进去的间壁两侧的两个钩子之间，弯弯地横系着一根绳子，上面挂着四块对折的小方手绢：一块挨着一块，彼此并不重叠，呈长方形。另外还有一双灰色长统女袜，袜帮是用莱尔棉线[ 25] 织的，脚脖子以下是通常的样式。两端各用一个木制直夹子夹起，第三个夹子则夹在胯间重叠的部分。 \n \n 布卢姆在铁灶上瞧见了什么？ \n \n 右边（较小）的锅架上摆着个带柄的蓝色搪瓷小平底锅，左边较大）的壶架上是黑色的铁壶。 \n \n 布卢姆在铁灶上做些什么？ \n \n 他把平底锅挪到左边的壶架上，站起来，又将铁壶送到洗涤槽那儿去。这样，扭开自来水龙头就可以放水灌壶了。 \n \n 水流出来了吗？ \n \n 流了。从威克洛郡的容积二十四亿加仑的朗德伍德水库，流经达格尔河、拉思唐、唐斯峡谷和卡洛希尔，流进坐落于斯蒂尔奥根那二十六英亩的水库，中间的距离是二十二法定英里。这条有着过滤装置的第一期施工的单管及复管地下引水渠，根据合同直线每码的铺设费为五英镑。再由一批水堰进行调节，以二百五十英尺的坡度在上利森街的尤斯塔斯桥流到本市界内。但是由于夏季久旱，再加上每天供水一千二百五十万加仑，水位已降到低于排水口。都市监察官兼水道局技官、土木工程师斯潘塞·哈蒂奉水道局的指示（鉴于有可能会像一八九三年那样被迫利用大运河和皇家运河那不宜饮用的水），除了饮用外，下令一律禁止使用市里供应的自来水。尤其是南都柏林济贫院，尽管限定用六英寸的计量器，每个贫民每日配给十五加仑水，然而在市政府法律顾问、辩护律师伊格内修斯·赖斯的监督下，经查表证实，每夜要浪费两万加仑水，从而使院外的社会各阶层（也就是自费并有支付能力的纳税者们）蒙受损害。 \n \n 回到铁灶后，这位爱水、放水、运水的布卢姆，赞美了水的哪些属性？ \n \n 它的普遍性，它的民主的平等性，以及保持着它自身求平的本质。用墨卡托投影法[26]在地图上所标示出的浩淼的海洋；太平洋中巽他海沟那超过八千噚[27]的不可测的深度；永不消停、后浪推前浪地冲刷着海岸线每一部位的波涛以及水面上的微粒子；水的单位粒子的独立性；海洋变幻莫测；根据液体静力学，风平浪静时它纹丝不动；根据液体动力学，小潮大潮时它便涨了起来。暴风雨后一片沉寂；北极圈与南极圈冰冠地带的不毛性以及对气候及贸易的影响；跟地球上的陆地相比占三对一优势；它在亚赤道带南回归线以南的整个区域延伸无数平方海里的绝对权威；其在原始海盆里数千万年以来所保持的稳定性；它那橙红色海床；它那把包括数百万吨贵金属在内的可溶解物质加以溶解，并使之保持在溶解状态的性能；它对半岛和有下陷趋势的岬角所产生的缓慢的浸蚀作用；其冲积层；其重量、容积与浓度；它在咸水湖、高山湖里的静谧；其色调因热带、温带和寒带而变为或浓或淡；与陆上的湖泊、溪流及支流汇合后注入海洋的河川，还有横跨大洋的潮流所构成的运输网。沿着赤道下面的水路自北向南的湾流；海震、水龙卷、自流井、喷泉、湍流、漩涡、河水暴涨、倾盆大雨、海啸、流域、分水岭、间歇泉、大瀑布、漩流、海漩、洪水、泛滥、暴雨等滥施淫威；环绕陆地的上层土壤那漫长的曲线；源泉的奥秘可用探矿杖来占卜或用湿度测定器来揭示；阿什汤大门的墙壁上的洞[28]、空气的饱和与露水的蒸发能够证明那潜在的湿度；水的成分单纯，是氢二、氧一的化合物；水的疗效；水的死海里的浮力；它在小溪、涧谷、水坝的缝隙、船舷的裂口所显示的顽强的浸透性；它那清除污垢、解渴、灭火、滋养植物的性能；作为模范和典型，它的可靠性；它变化多端：雾、霭、云、雨、麦、雪、雹；并在坚固的消防龙头上发挥出压力；而且千姿百态：湖泊、湖岔、内海、海湾、海岬、环礁湖、环状珊瑚岛、多岛海、海峡、峡江、明奇[29]、潮汐港湾、港湾；冰河、冰山、浮动冰原显示出它是何等坚硬；在运转水车、水轮机、发电机、发电厂、漂白作坊、鞣皮厂、打麻厂时，它又是那样驯顺；它在运河、可航行的河川、浮船坞和干船坞所起的作用；潮汐的动力化或利用水路的落差使它得以发挥潜力；海底那些成群的动物和植物（无听觉，怕光）虽然并非名副其实地栖息在地球上，论数目却占地球上生物的一大半；水无所不在，占人体的百分之九十；在沼泽地、闹瘟疫的湿地、馊了的花露水[30]以及月亏期[31]那淤积污浊的水塘子，水所散发的恶臭充满了毒气。 \n \n 他把灌了半下子水的壶放在燃旺了的煤火上之后，为什么又折回到还在哗哗流着水的自来水龙头那儿去呢？ \n \n 为了把那块已用掉一部分、还粘着包装纸、散发着柠檬气味的巴灵顿[32]牌肥皂（价值四便士，是十二个钟头以前赊购的）涂在脏手上，在新鲜冰凉、永恒不变而又不断变化的水里洗净，用那条套在旋转式木棍子上的红边长麻布揩拭脸和双手。 \n \n 斯蒂芬是以什么理由来拒绝接受布卢姆的提议的？ \n \n 他说自己患有恐水病，不论是局部浸入也罢，还是全身泡进去也罢，讨厌与冷水接触。（他是头年十月问最后一次洗澡的）；不喜欢玻璃和水晶这样的水状物质，对思维与语言的流动性也疑惑重重。 \n \n 布卢姆原想对斯蒂芬做一些有关卫生和预防方面的劝告，并且想告诉他，在进行海水浴或河水浴之前，应该先把头部弄湿，还往面庞、颈背、胸部与上腹部猛然浇水，禆使筋肉收缩，因为人体对低温最敏感的部位乃是后颈、胃部和脚心。然而他为什么又放弃了这个念头呢？ \n \n 因为水的特性与天才那乖僻的独创性是互不相容的。 \n \n 另外他还同样抑制住了什么带有说教意味的劝告呢？ \n \n 营养食谱：关于熏猪肉、腌鳕鱼和黄油中所含有的蛋白质与热量的百分比。黄油缺乏前者，熏猪肉富于后者。 \n \n 在东道主眼中，客人最显著的长处是什么？ \n \n 自信，有着自我放任和自我恢复这两种同等的而又相反的能力。 \n \n 由于火的作用，水容器里发生了何等伴随而至的现象？ \n \n 沸腾现象。自厨房至烟囱的孔道，不断地向上通风，灼热的火被它煽得从成束的易燃柴禾延烧到多面体烟煤堆上。这种煤炭含有原始森林的落叶堆积后凝缩而成的矿物状化石；森林之发育生长靠的是热（辐射性）源--太阳，而热又是由那普遍存在、传光并透热的能媒[33]传导的。燃烧所引起的运动形式之一--热（对流传热），不断地、加速度地从热源体传导给容器中的液体，由那凹凸不平、未经打磨的黑色铸铁面把热向周围发散出去；一部分反射回来，一部分被吸收，另一部分被传导，使水的温度从常温逐渐升到沸点。这种温度的上升可作为消费结果标志如下：将一磅水从华氏五十度加热到二百十二度，需耗七十二热量单位。 \n \n 温度上升完毕是怎样显示出来的？ \n \n 从壶盖下面同时向两侧喷出两股镰刀形状的水蒸气。 \n \n 布卢姆能用这样煮沸的水办些什么个人的事？ \n \n 剃自己的胡子。 \n \n 夜里剃胡子有什么好处？ \n \n 胡子柔软一些。如果剃完胡子后，故意把刷子浸泡在浓肥皂液里，下次用的时候，刷子就会柔软一些了。万一于意外的时刻在远处同相识的女人邂逅，皮肤还是光滑的好。一边剃胡子，一边还安详地回顾当天的事情。能够睡得更清爽一些，一觉醒来，感到更洁净利落。因为一到早晨就有种种噪音，心里又悬念不安，牛奶罐咣当咣当响，邮递员连敲了两遍门。读了份报纸，一边重读一边涂肥皂液，在同一个地方又涂上肥皂液；把一些微不足道的事想成了不起。于是受一次冲击，挨一个打击，就加快了剃刀的速度，割了个口子，这时就铰下一块不大不小的橡皮膏，润湿后贴上去。只好这么样。 \n \n 为什么缺乏光线不像噪音的存在那么使他烦恼？ \n \n 因为他这双既结实又肥胖、既是男性的又是女性的、既被动又主动的手，有着准确的触感。 \n \n 它（他的手）具有什么特性，然而又伴随着什么抵消作用？ \n \n 它具有动外科手术的特性，然而即便在目的足以证明手段是正当的情况下，他也决不愿意让人流血，而更喜欢顺应自然法则的日光疗法、心理生理疗法以及整骨外科手术。 \n \n 布卢姆打开厨房碗柜：下、中、上层都露出些什么？ \n \n 下层竖立着五个早餐用的盘子，平放着六个早餐用的垫盘，盘子上各扣着一只早餐用的杯子，还有一只并非扣放着的搪须杯[34]和德比制造的有着王冠图案的垫盘[35]，四只金边白色蛋杯，一个敞着口的岩羚羊皮包，里面露出些硬币，大多是铜市。还有一个小玻璃瓶，里面装着加了芳香剂的糖果（紫罗兰色的）。中层放着一只盛了胡椒粉的有缺口的蛋杯，饭桌上还摆着那种鼓状食盐瓶，用油纸包着的四颗粘成一团的黑色橄榄，一听李树商标肉罐头[36]的空罐儿，垫着纤丝的椭圆形柳条筐里是一只泽西[37]梨，喝剩下的半瓶威廉·吉尔比公司[ 38] 釀造的药用白葡萄酒（裹在瓶子上的粉珊瑚色薄绘纸已剥掉了一半），一包埃普斯公司制造的速溶可可；一只绉锡纸袋里装着安妮·林奇公司[39]出品的五英两特级茶叶，每磅二先令；一只圆筒形罐子，盛着优质结晶角沙糖；两颗葱头，较大的那颗西班牙种的是完整的，较小的那颗爱尔兰种的已经切成两瓣儿，面积扩大了，气味也更冲鼻了；一罐爱尔兰模范奶场的奶酪，一只褐色陶罐，盛着四分之一品脱零四分之一兑了水并变酸了的牛奶（由于炎热，它已化为水、酸性乳浆与半固体凝乳，再加上布卢姆先生和弗莱明大妈[40]作为早餐消费掉的部分，就足够一英品脱了，相当于原先送来的总量）；两朵丁香花蕾，一枚半便士硬币和盛有一片新鲜排骨肉的一个小碟子。上层是大小和产地各不相同的一排果酱罐[41]。 \n \n 撂在碗柜檐板[42]上的什么东西引起了他的注意？ \n \n 两张撕成了四块多角形碎片的深红色赛马券[43]，号码是：887，886。 \n \n 由于想起了什么，他一时皱起眉来？ \n \n 他想起了金质奖杯平地障碍赛的结果曾怎样通过一连串巧合预示了出来。事实真是比虚构还要奇妙：他是在巴特桥的马车夫棚里，在《电讯晚报》的粉色最终版上读到这场赛马正式的确切结果的。 \n \n 他是在哪里客观地或主观地接受关于胜败结果的预告的？ \n \n 在坐落于小不列颠街八、九、十号的伯纳德·基尔南那特准卖酒的店家[44]里；在公爵街十四号戴维·伯恩那特准卖酒的店家里；在下奥康内尔街格雷厄姆·莱蒙那家店铺外面，当时一个阴沉沉的人曾把一张传单[45]塞到他手里（后来被他丢掉了），而那是给锡安教会的重建者以利亚做的广告；在林肯广场上，药剂师们开的F·W·斯威尼公司（股份有限）外面，他正要把当天的《自由人报与国民报》丢掉（后来还是被他丢掉了）时，弗雷德里克·M.（班塔姆）莱昂斯迫不及待地连声向他把报讨了去，读罢，又还给了他；接着他就朝着坐落在兰斯特尔街十一号的土耳其蒸汽浴那东方式建筑踱去。在灵感的照耀下，他容光焕发，双臂搂着胜负的秘密[46]，那是用预言镌刻下来的。 \n \n 什么样的缓解的考虑减轻了他心神的不安？ \n \n 事件发生后，它所带来的结局各有不同，正如放电后传来的音响那样难以解释。即使原来做的是获胜的解释，由于对万一输了时的损失总额不能正确地加以估价，究竟对现实的损害可能有多大，心中是没有谱儿的。 \n \n 他的心境如何？ \n \n 他没有冒险，无所期待，不曾失望，心满意足。 \n \n 什么使他心满意足？ \n \n 他没有蒙受实质上的损失。使旁人获得了实质上的利益。外邦人的光[47]。 \n \n 布卢姆是怎样为那个外邦人准备夜宵儿的？ \n \n 他往两个茶杯里各舀了满满二平调羹--统共四调羹埃普斯牌速溶可可，根据商标上所印用法说明，给它充分的时间去溶化，再把指定的添味料按照规定的分量和方法兑进去，让它散开来。 \n \n 东道主对客人额外表示了什么特别殷勤的款待？ \n \n 他没有使用其独生女米莉森特（米莉）送给他的有着王冠图案仿造德比的搪须杯，而这是他作为东道主理应享受的权利。他用的是跟客人一佯的茶碗，还给客人放了大量平素留给玛莉恩（摩莉）早餐时吃的浓奶油，自己却只适度地放了一点。 \n \n 客人可曾意识到招待得这样亲切，并表示了感谢？ \n \n 他的东道主用打趣的口吻提醒他注意一下自己尽的这番心意，他一本正经地领了情。这当儿他们正半庄半谐、一声不响地喝着埃普斯公司大量生产的保健滋补的可可。 \n \n 东道主是不是还有苗头想要在其他方面尽点心意，却抑制住了，留待日后由另一个人或者由自己来完成今天开始的行动？ \n \n 他的客人身上那件上衣右侧有个一英寸半的裂口，得给缝上。只要弄清那四条女用手绢中的哪一条拿得出手，就把它送给客人。 \n \n 谁喝得快一些？ \n \n 布卢姆。他比客人早喝了十秒钟，从不断地传热的调羹柄下端的凹面啜可可的速度是：对方每啜一口，他啜三口；对方每啜两口，他啜六口；对方每啜三口，他就啜九口。 \n \n 他这种反复的行为引起了什么思考活动？ \n \n 他根据观察误以为默默无言的伙伴正在打腹稿。他想道，使自己得到乐趣的与其说是娱乐性的文学，毋宁说是教诲性的文学。为了解答想像中或现实生活中的疑难问题，他本人就曾不只一次地向威廉·莎士比亚的作品请教过。 \n \n 他从中得到解答了吗？ \n \n 尽管借助于一部词汇辞典，他曾仔细反复阅读过某些经典篇章，然而总也未能在每一点上都获得妥切的解答，所以他从原著中只得到了不充分的信念。 \n \n 一八七七年，满十一岁可能成为诗人的布卢姆，为参加《三叶苜蓿》[48]周刊征文比赛（奖金分别为十先令、五先令、二先令半）而作的第一首诗的最后一节是怎么写的？ \n \n 心怀奢望盼一睹， \n \n 小诗排印成铅字， \n \n 倘蒙不弃予采录， \n \n 但愿赐之以篇幅， \n \n 末端乞将敝名署， \n \n 我名叫利·布卢姆。 \n \n 他曾否发现有四种要素在使自己和这位不速之客之间产生隔阂？ \n \n 姓名，年龄，种族，信仰。 \n \n 少年时代，他根据自己的姓名编过哪些字谜？ \n \n 利奥波德·布卢姆Leopold Bloom \n \n 艾尔波德勃姆尔 Ellpodbomool[49] \n \n 莫尔德皮卢布 Molldopeloob \n \n 勃罗皮杜姆 Bollopedoom \n \n 下议院议员老奥列勃 Old Ollebo，M.P. \n \n 一八八八年二月十四日，他（动态诗人[50]）用自己的教名首字写成怎样一首藏头诗（[51]，寄给了玛莉恩（摩莉）·特威迪？ \n \n 诗人频用韵文写， \n \n 神妙赞歌圣音乐， \n \n 九九八十一重叠， \n \n 胜似诗酒情切切， \n \n 咸属我卿与世界。 \n \n 是什么阻止他去完成那首题名《要是布赖恩·勃鲁[52]如今回来看到了老都柏林》的主题歌（并由R.G. 约翰逊配乐）的呢？那本是坐落于南国王街门牌四十六、四十七、四十八、四十九号的欢乐剧场的承租人迈克尔·冈恩[ 53] 约他编写的。该歌原来预定插在照例于圣诞节期间公演的大型哑剧《水手辛伯达》第六场《钻石谷》（一八九三年第二版，作者：格林利夫·惠蒂尔[54]，舞台装置：乔治·A·杰克逊和塞西尔·希克斯；服装：惠兰太太与惠兰小姐；导演：R. 谢尔顿；一八九二年十二月二十六日在迈克尔·冈恩夫人亲自监督下演出，芭蕾舞女演员为杰西·诺亚，丑角为托马斯·奥托）中，是由女主角内莉·布弗里斯特[55]演唱的。 \n \n 首先，有关皇室与当地的两档子事，歌中究竟写哪一桩，令人难以做出抉择。要么是提前描写维多利亚女王（一八二0 年出生，一八三七年即位）的六十周年大庆[56]；要么是将新修建的市营鱼市开张典礼的日期[ 57] 移后。第二，深恐皇族约克公爵和公爵夫人[58] （实有其人）以及布赖恩·勃鲁国王陛下（虚构的人物）分别前来访问一事，会招致来自左右两方面的反对。第三，新峻工的伯格码头区的大歌剧厅和霍金斯街的皇家剧场[ 59] ，存在着职业的礼仪与职业的竞争之间的矛盾。第四，由于内莉·布弗里斯特的那种非理性、非政治、不时兴的容貌会引起观众的同情；内莉·布弗里斯特身穿非理性、非政治、不时兴的白色衬衣，当她（内莉·布弗里斯特）表演时一旦将衬衣袒露出来，会撩拨观众的情欲，令人担心会使观众神魂颠倒。第五，不论是挑选适当的乐曲还是从《笑话共赏集》（共一千页，每个笑话都令人捧腹）里选一些滑稽的隐喻都是困难的。第六，这首主题歌不论谐不谐音，都与新任市长大人丹尼尔·塔仑、新任行政司法长官托马斯·派尔以及新任副检察长邓巴·普伦凯特·巴顿[60]的姓名有联系。 \n \n 他们的年龄之间有什么关系？ \n \n 十六年前的一八八八年，当布卢姆在眼下的斯蒂芬这个年龄时，斯蒂芬是六岁。十六年后的一九二0年，当斯蒂芬到了布卢姆那个年龄时，布卢姆已经交五十四岁了。到一九三六年布卢姆年届七十、斯蒂芬交五十四岁时，他们二人的年龄比率就由原来的十六比零变成十七点五比十三点五。将来随着彼此年龄的任意增长，比率会越来越大，差距则越来越小。因为倘若一八八三年存在的那个比率有可能一成不变地延续下去，那么一九0 四年，当斯蒂芬二十二岁时，布卢姆就应该是三百七十四岁了；而到了一九二0 年，当斯蒂芬三十八岁（也就是布卢姆现在这个年龄）时，布卢姆就应该是六百四十六岁了；而一九五二年，当斯蒂芬活到大洪水之后的最高年龄七十岁[61]时，布卢姆就已交一千一百九十岁，生年为七一四年[62]；比大洪水之前的最长寿者，也就是活到九百六十九岁的玛土撒拉[63]还要多二百二十一岁。倘若斯蒂芬继续活下去，在公元三0 七二年达到这个岁数，布卢姆就已经是八万三千三百岁了，而他的生年按说是纪元前八一三九六年[ 64] 。 \n \n 什么事会使这些计算归于无效呢？ \n \n 双方或其中一方停止生存；制定出一种新纪元或历法，或世界的灭亡所导致的不可避免而又难以预料的人类之灭绝。 \n \n 他们以前遇见过几次，从而能够证明彼此是老相识？ \n \n 两次。第一次是一八八七年，在圆镇基玛吉路，通称梅迪纳别墅的马特。狄龙家的丁香园里；同席的还有斯蒂芬的母亲。当时斯蒂芬才五岁，不喜欢伸出手去跟人打招呼[65]。第二次是一八九二年一月，一个下雨的星期日，在布雷斯林饭店的咖啡室里。同室的有斯蒂芬的父亲和叔祖父，当时斯蒂芬又长了五岁。 \n \n 由那个做儿子的提出来、做父亲的后来也表示赞同的那次赴家宴的邀请，布卢姆接受了吗？ \n \n 他十分领情，非常感谢，由衷地领情感谢，并且深抱遗憾地加以谢绝。 \n \n 他们围绕这些回忆而谈着的话中，可曾透露出双方之间还有第三个联系？ \n \n 一八八八年九月一日至一八九一年十二月二十九日，一位手头有点积蓄的寡妇赖尔登太太[66]（丹特）曾住在斯蒂芬的父母家里。一八九二、九三和九四年间，她曾住在普鲁西亚街五十四号的市徽饭店[ 67] ，是伊丽莎白·奥多德开的。一八九三年至一八九四年问，布卢姆也在同一家饭店住过一个时期，那阵子她经常为布卢姆做耳报神。当时布卢姆在史密斯菲尔德五号的约瑟夫·卡夫手下当雇员，在附近的北环路都柏林牲畜市场担任贩卖监督。 \n \n 在体力方面，他可曾对她有过什么善举？ \n \n 有时在温暖的夏日傍晚，布卢姆把这位多少拥有一些资产足以自立的病孀扶到康复期患者坐的轮椅上，慢慢地将她推到北环路拐角处加文·洛[ 68] 先生的牲畜交易场所对面。她在那儿逗留上半晌，隔着他那架单镜头双筒望远镜眺望那些难以辨认的市民们：他们搭乘电车、气胎打得鼓鼓的自行车、出租马车、双驾马车、自家用或租来的四轮马车、单马拉的双轮马车、轻便小马车和大型四轮游览马车，在市区与凤凰公园之间穿梭着。 \n \n 他何以对这样的看护工作如此安之若素？ \n \n 因为他在青壮年时，经常坐在屋里，隔着那嵌有浮凸饰的五彩圆玻璃窗子，观察外界大街上千变万化的景物：步行者、四足动物、脚踏车、车辆，或急匆匆或慢悠悠或不紧不慢地经过，沿着垂直的圆球面的边缘滴溜溜、滴溜溜、滴溜溜地旋转。对于八年前去世的她，他们二人各自有着什么样截然不同的记忆？ \n \n 年长的那位记得她那比齐克牌戏[69]和筹码，她那只斯凯骾狗[70]，她所冒充的富有，她对事物怎样缺乏反应，她所患的初期卡他性耳聋。年轻的那位则记得她那盏供在无染原罪圣母玛利亚雕像前的菜油灯，她用来象征查理·斯图尔特。巴涅尔和迈克尔，达维特的绿色刷子和绦紫色刷子，她的薄绉纸[ 71] 。 \n \n 通过对年轻的朋友所透露的这些回忆，他更巴不得能恢复青春了，然而他还有没有办法来实现呢？ \n \n 室内健身操。尤今·桑道[72]所著《体力与健身术》中规定了如何操练。以前，他时断时续地练过，后来干脆放弃了。这种健身操是特地为坐着工作的商人所编排的，必须照着镜子聚精会神地操练，活动一下身上各个部位的筋肉，依次一张一弛地做令人心旷神怡的运动，以便恢复能给人带来莫大愉悦的青春活力。 \n \n 青少年时代他可曾显示过特殊的机敏， \n \n 尽管在举重比赛方面他的体力不够，对于空中旋转，勇气又不足，然而念高中时，多亏腹部肌肉异常发达，他有本领在双杠上两臂垂直，双腿向前抬起，与身子成直角，长时间稳定地保持平衡。 \n \n 二人之中有哪个直率地提到种族不同的问题吗？ \n \n 谁都没有提。 \n \n 布卢姆对斯蒂芬关于布卢姆的看法到底怎么想法？而且，布卢姆对斯蒂芬究竟怎样看待布卢姆关于斯蒂芬的看法又有何想法？如果把这些想法用最简单的相互形式扼要地表达出来，究竟是怎 \n \n 样的？ \n \n 他［布卢姆］认为，他［斯蒂芬]在想他［布卢姆]是个犹太人；同时他［布卢姆]知道，他［斯蒂芬］晓得他［布卢姆］明白他嘶蒂芬] \n \n 并不是个犹太人[73]。 \n \n 冲破了沉默的樊篱后，他们弄清彼此的父母是什么人了吗？ \n \n 布卢姆是经过松博特海伊[74]、维也纳、布达佩斯、米兰、伦敦而来到都柏林的鲁道尔夫·维拉格（后改名为鲁道尔夫·布卢姆）和艾琳。希金斯之间所生的唯一的男子继承人，而艾琳是朱利叶斯。希金斯（原姓卡罗利）和范妮·希金斯（旧姓赫加蒂）之次女。斯蒂芬是自科克来到都柏林的西蒙·迪达勒斯与玛丽之间所生的孩子当中尚健在的共同的男子继承人中最年长的，而玛丽则是理查[75]与克里斯蒂娜·古尔丁（原姓格里尔）之女。 \n \n 布卢姆和斯蒂芬都领洗了吗？在哪儿？ 洗礼是由谁给施行的？ \n \n 是由神职人员还是在俗人员？ \n \n 布卢姆（领过三次洗）：在库姆的耶稣教圣尼古拉斯·威思奥特教堂，由可敬的文学士吉尔默·约翰斯顿独自为他施洗；在索兹 \n \n 村[76]的水泵下，由詹姆斯·奥康纳·菲利普·吉利根和詹姆斯· \n \n 菲茨杰拉德共同为他施洗；在拉思加尔的三位主保圣人教堂由那位可敬的天主教神父查理·马洛尼[77]独自为他施洗。斯蒂芬（领过一次洗）：在拉思加尔的三位主保圣人教堂由那位可敬的天主教神父查理·马洛尼独自为他施洗。 \n \n 他们二人可曾发现彼此有相似的学历？ \n \n 倘若斯蒂芬与布卢姆换个位置，斯图姆[78]就会顺序从幼儿学校起念完高中。倘若布卢姆与斯蒂芬换个位置，布利芬[79]就会顺序读完中等教育的预备科、初级、中级、高级课程，通过王家大学的入学考试，依次读完文科一、二年级，继而修完文学士课程。 \n \n 为什么布卢姆抑制住自己，不曾说他进过人生这所大学？ \n \n 因为他拿不准自己是否已对斯蒂芬说过此话，或者斯蒂芬是否曾对他这么说过。 \n \n 他们二人分别代表哪两种气质： \n \n 科学气质。艺术气质。 \n \n 布卢姆所提出的哪些例证足以证明，他的个性与其说是倾向于理论科学，毋宁说是倾向于应用科学。 \n \n 当吃饱后，为了助消化而仰卧着时，他曾思考过几项发明的可能性。这是由于认识到如今虽已司空见惯、当初却曾是巨大革新的那些发明的重要性，从而受到刺激：比方说，航空降落伞、反射望远镜、螺丝锥、别针、瓶装矿泉水、运河那有着绞车与泄水道的闸门装置、抽水机。 \n \n 他这些发明主要是用来推动幼儿园改良计划的吗？ \n \n 是的。就是要把纸枪、橡胶浮囊、掷骰子游戏和弹弓排斥出去；其中包括展示白羊宫乃至双鱼宫这十二宫星座的天体万花筒、小型机械装置的太阳系仪、算术用菱形果子冻、相当于动物饼干的几何图形饼干、游戏用地球仪皮球、身穿历史服装的玩偶。 \n \n 另外还有哪些因素在激发着他去开动脑筋？ \n \n 伊弗雷姆·马克斯和查尔斯·奥·詹姆斯在金融上取得的成功。前者是在南乔治街四十二号举办一便士展销会，后者在亨利街三十号开了一爿六便士半店铺并举办世界小商品市场和蜡制品展览会，门票：成人两便士，儿童一便士。还有近代广告术方面迄未开拓的无限可能性。如果压缩成三字母单一观念[80]的记号，那就是：竖着，能够最大限度地看到（察觉）；横着，能够最大限度地读到（辨认），还有着不知不觉地吸引人的注意力，产生兴趣，使之信服并采取行动的催眠般功效。 \n \n 好的例子呢？ \n \n 吉·ll。吉诺批发店 11 裤子[81]。 \n \n 钥匙议院。亚历山大·杰·凯斯。 \n \n 不好的例子呢？ \n \n 瞧瞧这支长蜡烛。你要是猜中了它什么时候能燃尽，就免费赠送一双本店特制真皮靴子，保证足有一烛光的光泽。地址：巴克利与库克，塔尔博特街十八号[82]。 \n \n 杆菌[83]牌（杀虫剂）。 \n \n 最佳[84]牌（鞋油）。 \n \n 你要[85]牌（与螺丝锥、指甲挫和烟斗通条合并在一起的双刃折叠小刀）。 \n \n 最糟糕的呢？ \n \n 倘若你家里没有：李树牌的肉罐头， \n \n 那就是美中不足， \n \n 有它才算幸福窝[86]。 \n \n 都柏林商人码头二十三号乔治·普勒姆垂制造，每听装四英两。这则广告是市政委员、下院议员约瑟夫·岶·南尼蒂（哈德威克街十九号圆形建筑小区）给插到讣吿和忌日通告栏下面的[87]。商标是李树。注册的商标是李树肉罐头。谨防冒牌货：皮特莫特、特拉姆普利、莫特帕特、普拉姆特鲁[88]。 \n \n 他举出哪个例证来诱使斯蒂芬去推断，独创性尽管能产生各自的报酬，但未必总能导致成功呢？ \n \n 他本人曾想出个主意：让牲口拉一辆有照明装置的陈列车，由两个衣着时髦的姑娘坐在里面正埋头写着什么。然而这个建议没被采纳[89]。 \n \n 在此建议的启迪下，当时斯蒂芬在脑中构成了怎样一幅情景？ \n \n 山径里的一座孤零零的客栈。秋日。暮色苍茫。壁炉里燃着火。一个小伙子坐在昏暗的角落里。一个年轻的女人走了进来。心绪怔忡不安。孤单单的。她坐下。她踱到窗口。她站起来。她坐下。暮色苍茫。她思索。她坐在孤零零的客栈里在纸上写着。她沉吟。她写。她叹气。车轮和马蹄声。她赶忙走出去。他从昏暗角落里踱过来。他摸住那张孤零零的纸。他迎着火光举起信。暮色苍茫。他读信。孤单单的。 \n \n 哦？ \n \n 用斜体、直体和左斜体字写着：王后饭店，王后饭店，王后饭店，王后饭…… \n \n 这一启迪使布卢姆重新想起了什么情景？ \n \n 克莱尔郡恩尼斯的王后饭店。一八八六年六月十七日傍晚，鲁道尔夫·布卢姆（鲁道尔夫·维拉格）因服用过量的乌头（附子），在此故去，时间不详。他服的是按附子搽剂二、氯仿搽剂一（系他于一八八六年六月二十七日上午十点二十分在恩尼斯教会街十七号弗朗西斯·登内希药房所购），按比例亲自配制的神经痛搽剂。尽管并非由于此举，然而在此举之前，一八八六年六月二十七日下午三点十五分，他曾从恩尼斯的通衢大道四号詹姆斯·卡伦普通服装店购买了一顶崭新而时髦的特级硬壳平顶草帽（尽管并非由于此举，然而在此举之前，他于前文中所述的时刻与地点，购买了前边提到的毒剂）。 \n \n 他把这种同名异物[90]归因于从别人那里获知，或属巧合，要么是出自直觉？ \n \n 巧合。 \n \n 他可曾绘声绘色地口头描述给客人听？ \n \n 他宁愿注视对方的脸，倾听对方的话，这下子一个潜在的故事就生动他讲出来了，从而使他心头的忐忑不安[91]也可得到缓解。 \n \n 他可曾从叙述者向他讲的第二个情景（不论是《登比斯迦山眺望巴勒斯但》还是《李子寓言》[92]）中，仅仅发现了第二个“巧合”？ \n \n 与第一个情景以及虽未讲出来却寓在其中的其他一些情景相联系，再加上学生时代关于种种问题和道德格言所写的散文（诸如我热爱的英雄》[93]）或《怠惰乃时间之窃贼》），他认为文章本身，又结合着人与人之间的差别，总是包含着在经济、社会、个人以及性方面获得成功之可能性。不论是作为模范的教育题材（百分之百地有益）特别选拔出来收入全集或选集，供预科及初级班的学生使用；要么就仿效菲利普·博福伊[94]、迪克博士[95]或是赫布仑的《蓝色研究》[96]的先例，把稿子投给销路和槁酬都有保证的杂志，排印出来；要么就迎着四天后到来的夏至（日出为凌晨三点三十三分，日没为下午八点二十九分），即六月二十一日（星期二，圣阿洛伊苏斯·贡萨加[97] ，利用那以后徐徐来到、逐渐漫长起来的夜晚，使用口头语言诉诸富于同情心的听众，他们对高明的叙述技巧默加赞赏，对杰出的成就满怀信心地事先祝贺，并在理智方面给予激励。 \n \n 什么样的家庭问题，即使不会超过其他问题，起码也不相上下地频频使他操心？ \n \n 该怎么应付咱们的老婆。 \n \n 他所设想的独特的解决方案是什么样的？ \n \n 室内游戏（多米诺骨牌，希腊跳棋[98]，挑圆片[99]），抽杆游戏，杯球[100] ，纳普[101] ，抢五墩牌，比齐克，二十五墩[102] ，“抢光我的邻居”[103] ，跳棋，国际象棋或十五子棋戏[104] ）；为警察署资助的服装协会[105] 做刺绣、缝补或编织等活计；音乐二重奏：曼陀林和吉他，钢琴和长笛，吉他和钢琴；法律文件的抄写或代填信封上的地址；每隔一周去看一次杂耍演出；从事一些商业活动：一位老板娘在凉爽的牛奶房或暖和的香烟店里愉快地使唤着，愉快地被服从着；在由国家监督、并加以医药管理的男妓院里，暗自从淫欲刺激中得到的满足；与住在附近的一些被公认为品行端正的女友们进行社交活动，需要有不频繁的定期预防性间隔以及频繁的定期预防性监督；为了讲授合适的交往礼仪而专门举办一套夜间讲座。 \n \n 他的妻子在智力发展方面的缺陷，有哪些事例促使他倾向于采取前边提到的（第九项）解决方案？ \n \n 当她没事可干的时候，她不只一次地在一张纸上胡乱写满了符号和象形文字，并说那是希腊字、爱尔兰字和希伯来字。隔一阵子她就总是问上一遍：加拿大一座叫魁北克的城市那个大写的头一个字母是什么？她几乎不理解国内复杂的政治情势；国际上的势力均衡。在加算帐单时，她往往要借助于手指头。写完一篇书简体短文后，她就把书写用具丢在蜡画颜料里，任其暴露在硫酸亚铁、绿矾和五倍子中去腐蚀[106]。对那些没有听惯的多音节外来语，她总是根据语音或模拟类推，或将二者折衷，牵强附会：例如把“轮回”说成是“遇见了他尖头胶皮管[107]”，把“别名”一词说成是“《圣经》里提到的一个撤谎的人[108]”。 \n \n 要靠什么来弥补那由于理智失去平衡而在这些方面以及对人物、地点与事物所缺乏的判断呢？ \n \n 一切天平的一切垂直杠杆，均凭借其结构来证实表面上的平衡中的谬误。她对一个人的精确的判断，要靠实验来证明是正确的，从而取得平衡。 \n \n 为了补救这种相对的无知状态，他做过哪些尝试？ \n \n 种种尝试：将特定的一本书放在醒目的地方，把特定的一页翻开来；委婉地做些说明，并假定她头脑里对此有着潜在的知识；当着她的面公然挖苦不在场的某人如何由于无知而失态。 \n \n 他这样直接教育的尝试，取得了什么效果？ \n \n 她没有全听懂，只听懂了其中一部分。兴致勃勃地留神，惊奇地理解，细心地复诵，吃力地记下来，很容易地就忘掉，没有把握地重新记起，重复时错误百出。 \n \n 哪种方法证明更有效果？ \n \n 涉及个人利害关系的间接指点暗示。 \n \n 有什么例子？ \n \n 下雨时她讨厌打伞，而他喜欢打着雨伞的女人；她讨厌下雨时戴新帽子，而他喜欢女人戴新帽子；下雨时他买了顶新帽子，她戴着新帽子，手持雨伞。 \n \n 接受了客人那个寓言里所包含的类比之后，他举出哪些被囚虏[109] 过的大人物作为范例？ \n \n 三位纯粹真理的探求者：埃及的摩西、著有《迷途指津》的摩西。迈蒙尼德以及摩西·门德尔松[110]。他们都那么显赫，从摩西（埃及的）到摩西（门德尔松），从来没有像摩西（迈蒙尼德）那样的人物[111] 。 \n \n 斯蒂芬说声“对不起”，提出了第四个纯粹真理的探求者的名字：亚理斯多德。布卢姆答以“请原谅，也许我错了”，接着说了些什么？ \n \n 这位探求者是个犹太法学博士（姓名不详）的弟子。 \n \n 另外还提到了哪些足以凭信、享有盛名的法律界的儿子们--被迸选而又受排斥的种族的子孙？ \n \n 费利克斯·巴托尔迪·门德尔松（作曲家），巴鲁克。斯宾诺莎（哲学家）[112]，门多萨（拳击家），费迪南德·拉萨尔（社会改革家、决斗者）[113] 。 \n \n 客人对主人以及主人对客人，曾将古希伯来文和古爱尔兰文哪些诗句的片断，抑扬顿挫地并附以原词的译文，加以引用了？ \n \n 斯蒂芬引用的是：suil，suil，suil arun， suil go siocair agus suilgo cuin[114] （走，走，走你的路，平安地走，谨慎地走）。 \n \n 布卢姆引用的是kifeloch， harimon rakatejch m\u0027baad l\u0027zamatejch[115]（你的鬓角遮在头发里，如同一片石榴）。 \n \n 为了把口腔发声的比较加以具体化，他们对两种语言的音符怎样做了象形的比较[116]？ \n \n 在用低俗文学体裁写的一本题名《偷情的快乐》的书（是布卢姆掏出来的，他摆得很巧妙，使封面和桌面接触）那底封前倒数第二张空白衬页上，斯蒂芬用一管铅笔（斯蒂芬提供的）以简略体与装饰体写下相当于g、a、d、m的爱尔兰语字母[117]。布卢姆则写下希伯来字母ghimel、aleph、daleth和qoph（这是用来代替所缺的mem的）。他还说明，这些字母作为序数及基数的算数值，各自代表三、一、四及一百[118] 。 \n \n 两个人对这两种业已衰亡或复兴起来的语言所具有的知识，究竟是理论方面的还是实际方面的？ \n \n 理论方面的，只局限于词形变化以及句法结构方面的一些语法规则，实际上并不包括语汇知识。 \n \n 这两种语言之间以及使用这两种语言的两个民族之间，存在过哪些接触点？ \n \n 两种语言都有喉音、区分的气音、增音以及附属性的字母。两种都是古老的语言，大洪水后二四二年，费尼乌斯·法赛在西纳尔平原[119]所创办的学院就开了这两种语言的课程。他是以色列民族的祖先挪亚的后裔；又是爱尔兰民族的祖先埃贝尔与赫里蒙的始祖[120]。用这两种语言写成的考古学的、系谱学的、圣徒传记学的、注释学的、布道术的、地名研究的、历史的以及宗教方面的著作，其中包括犹太法学博士和神仆团[ 121] 团员的著述：托拉、《塔木德》（《密西拿》和革马拉）[122]、马所拉本、《五经》[123] 、《牛皮书》、《巴利莫特书》[124]、《霍斯饰本》、《凯尔斯书》[125]，记述这两个民族的离散：[126]，受迫害，幸存，复兴。他们在犹太人区（圣玛丽亚修道院）[127]和弥撒馆（亚当与夏娃客栈）[ 128] 孤零零地举行犹大教或基督教仪式。根据惩戒法及犹太人服装令[ 129] ，两个民族均被禁止穿民族服装。复兴锡安的大卫王国[ 130]以及爱尔兰的政治自治或主权转移的可能性。 \n \n 布卢姆对这种错综复杂、种族上不可分割的终极状态抱着期待，唱了哪一节颂歌呢？ \n \n 犹太魂坚定激荡， \n \n 由衷呐喊音铿锵[ 131]。 \n \n 唱完第一个对句后，歌声何以中断？ \n \n 那是由于在记忆方法上有缺陷的结果。 \n \n 歌手是如何弥补这一缺陷的呢？ \n \n 他对原文大致做了一番冗长的口译。 \n \n 他们二人彼此的见解，在哪一研究范畴内融为一体？ \n \n 从埃及碑铭的象形文字到希腊、罗马字母，足以追踪出逐渐变得单纯的迹象；还有楔形碑文（闪米特语[ 132] ）和斜线号五肋骨形欧甘文字[133] （凯尔特语），具有近代速记术与电报符号之先驱的性质。 \n \n 客人照主人的要求去做了吗？ \n \n 他用爱尔兰文字和罗马文字补上了签名，从而加倍地从命了。 \n \n 斯蒂芬在听觉上的反应如何？ \n \n 从那深沉苍老、充满阳刚之气而又生疏的旋律中，他听到了过去的累积。 \n \n 布卢姆在视觉上的反应如何？ \n \n 从那机警年轻、充满阳刚之气而又熟悉的身姿，他看到了未来的命运。 \n \n 斯蒂芬和布卢姆的隐蔽的本体那大致同时的、出于本人意志的大致感觉是怎样的？ \n \n 斯蒂芬是从视觉方面：有着传统的神人合一的基督[ 134]那种身姿。就像大马士革的约翰、罗马的伦图卢斯和隐修士伊皮凡尼乌斯所描述的那样，患了白癜风般的皮肤，一英尺半高的个儿，葡萄紫的头发。 \n \n 布卢姆是从听觉方面：令人销魂的浩劫那传统的声调[135] 。 \n \n 过去，布卢姆有过哪些将来可能从事的职业？能举出哪些典范？ \n \n 教会方面，罗马天主教会、英国圣公会或不从国教派[136]。典范为：耶稣会会长、十分可敬的约翰·康米神父、可敬的三一学院院长T·萨蒙神学博士、亚历山大·约·道维博士[137]。英国或爱尔兰律师业典范为：英国王室法律顾问西摩·布希，英国王室法律顾问鲁弗斯·伊塞克斯[ 138] 。剧坛，现代剧或莎士比亚戏剧。典范为：高雅的喜剧演员查理·温德姆，演莎士比亚戏剧的奥斯蒙·蒂尔利（卒于1901年）[139] 。 \n \n 主人可曾鼓励客人低声吟诵一段类似主题的奇妙传说？ \n \n 再三地鼓励了。因为他们呆在隐蔽的地方，谁都听不见他们说话的声音。并且煮好的饮料，除了水加糖加奶油加可可这种人工混合的准固体残存沉淀物之外，均已喝光。 \n \n 朗诵一下他所唱的故事诗第一部（大调的）： \n \n 哈里·休斯和学伴， \n \n 到外面去把球玩， \n \n 小哈里扔头一球， \n \n 飞越犹太家围墙， \n \n 小哈里扔第二球， \n \n 窗玻璃砸个精光。 \n \n 鲁道尔夫的儿子听了第一部，感觉怎样？ \n \n 他的感觉是单纯的。他这个犹太人面泛微笑高兴地倾听着，并望着厨房里那没有砸碎的窗玻璃。 \n \n 把故事诗第二部（小调的）朗诵一遍： \n \n 犹太闰女出来了， \n \n 浑身穿着绿衣裳， \n \n “小俊哥儿你回来， \n \n 再把球扔上一趟。” \n \n 我不能也不愿去， \n \n 除非学伴都在场， \n \n 要是老师知道了， \n \n 我会遭殃在球上。 \n \n 雪白的手牵着他， \n \n 把他引到大厅里， \n \n 最后步入一间房， \n \n 无人听见他叫嚷。 \n \n 她从兜里掏出刀， \n \n 把他小脑袋割掉， \n \n 他再不能把球踢， \n \n 因已躺到尸堆里[140]。 \n \n 米莉森特的父亲听了第二部，有怎样的反响？ \n \n 他的感情是复杂的。他板着面孔，惊异地听见并看见一个犹太人的闺女，浑身穿着绿衣裳。 \n \n 将斯蒂芬的评论概述一下。 \n \n 大家当中的一个，大家当中最渺小的一个，命中注定成为牺牲者。第一次是出于疏忽，第二次是故意地，他向命运挑战。当他孤零零的时候，宿命来临，向并不情愿的他进行挑战。作为希望与青春的化身，抓住他使他无法抵抗。命运把他领到一座奇异的住所，一间隐秘的背教者之居室，把顺从的他毫不留情地当作祭品宰杀。 \n \n 主人（命中注定的牺牲者）为什么闷闷不乐？ \n \n 他希望关于一个行为的故事，并非他本人之所为，不应由他[141] 讲出来。 \n \n 为什么主人（并不情愿，也并不抵抗）一动也不动？ \n \n 这是按照保存精力的法则。 \n \n 主人（隐秘的背教者）为什么一声不响？ \n \n 他在衡量着赞成和反对杀人祭神的可能的证据：神职人员的煽动以及民众的迷信；随着谣言的传播，致使真实性逐渐减少。对财富的嫉妒，复仇的影响，隔代遗传造成的不法行为的突发性再犯。有量情余地的狂信，催眠术的暗示和梦游病症状。 \n \n 这些精神上或肉体上的毛病（倘若有的话）中，哪样是他无法完全能够免除的？ \n \n 催眠术的暗示：有一次，他睡醒之后认不出自己的卧室了。不只一次，乍一睡醒，好半晌的工夫他既不能挪动身子也发不出声音。梦游者的恍惚状态：有一次在睡眠中，他起身低头弯腰去爬向没有热气的壁炉。爬到之后，他蜷缩着身子，在没有炉火取暖的情况下，穿着睡衣倒在那里睡了。 \n \n 后一种或同类的症候，可曾出现在他的哪个家族身上？ \n \n 曾经发生过两次，在霍利斯街和翁塔利奥高台街[142] 。当他的女儿米莉森特（米莉）六岁和八岁时，曾在睡眠中吓得喊叫起来。两个穿睡衣的身影问她怎么啦？她却茫然地答以沉默表情。 \n \n 关于她的幼年，另外他还记得些什么？ \n \n 一八八九年六月十五日。一个刚刚呱呱落地的脾气暴躁的女婴，哭哭啼啼，既导致又舒散充血性征候。这娃娃的外号叫“帕德尼·软鞋”[ 143] ，她咣当咣当地摇着攒钱罐，并数着父亲那三颗备用的便士硬币型纽扣：一呀，二呀，三。她把穿水手装的男小囝木偶丢掉了。尽管爹妈的头发都是深色的，她却继承了先辈的金发血统。古老的往昔，曾被诱奷，海瑙上尉[144] 先生，奥地利陆军；近因则是个幻觉，英国海军中的马尔维中尉。 \n \n 存在着哪些地域性的特色？ \n \n 反之，鼻子和前额的构造却继承了尽管中断过然而逐渐隔着更大的乃至最大的间歇遗传下来的直系血统。 \n \n 关于她的青春期，他记得一些什么？ \n \n 她把自己的铁环和跳绳藏到隐蔽的地方。在公爵草坪上，当一个英国旅游者央求她准许为她摄影留念时，她拒绝了（未说明反对的理由）。有一次她和埃尔莎·波特一道在南环路步行时，被一个面目狰狞的家伙跟踪上了。于是走到斯塔默街半途，她就蓦地折了回去（也没说明为什么要改变方向）。在过十五岁生日的前夕，她从韦斯特米思郡穆林加尔市写来一封信，简单地提了一下当地的一个学生（未说明他是哪一系和哪年级的）。 \n \n 成为第二次分手之预兆的第一次分手，使他感到苦恼了吗？ \n \n 比他所想象的要少，比他所希望的要多。 \n \n 这一瞬间，他目击到了什么样的第二次出走，尽管有差异，却又有类似之处？ \n \n 他的猫暂时出走了。 \n \n 何以会类似，又何以会有差异？ \n \n 类似点是，二者都是由某种隐秘的目的所驱使：寻觅一名新男子（穆林加尔市的学生）或药草（拔地麻）。差异在于，回到住户或住处来的可能性有所不同。 \n \n 在其他方面，二者之间的差异有类似之处吗？ \n \n 在被动性，节俭，传统的本能和唐突方面。 \n \n 例如？ \n \n 比方说，她依偎着他，托起金发，让他为她扎上缎带（与弓起脖子的猫比较一下）。而且，她连招呼也没打一声就朝着“斯蒂芬草地”那浩森的湖面[145]上啐了一口，唾沫浮在一棵棵树的倒影之间，划下一圈圈同心圆的波纹，持久而凝然不动，以一条人睡般平卧着的鱼为记号（与守候老鼠的猫相比）。而且，为了把一次著名战役的日期、双方作战部队的番号、战局以及战果都铭记心头，她拽自己的一条辫子来着（与舔耳朵的猫相比）。再者，傻米莉还梦见她和一匹马进行了一番无言的对谈，内容已记不得了。那匹马名叫约瑟夫，她捧给他（它）满满一大杯柠檬汽水，它（他）好像喝下去了（与在炉边做梦的猫相比）。因此，在被动性、节俭、因循的本能、唐突等方面，他们之间的差异是类似的。 \n \n 他曾怎样利用人们为了图个吉祥而送给他们的祝贺新婚的礼物： （1）一只猫头鹰和（2）一座钟，供她玩赏，并使她蒙受教益？ \n \n 他把它们作为实物教材，用以说明：（1）卵生动物的本性与习性，空中飞行的可能性，一种异常的视觉器官，世俗界用防腐药物保存尸体的方式。（2）体现于摆锤、齿轮与整时器上的钟摆的原理； 不动的针盘上那可移动的正转的长短指针在各个位置作为人或社会规范所包含的意义； 长针和短针每小时在同一倾斜度相遇的那一瞬间，也就是说，按照算术级数， 每小时超过5 5/11分的那一瞬间，每小时重复一次的精确性[146]。 \n \n 她是用什么方式回报他的呢？ \n \n 她都记在心里了：当他过二十七岁生日的时候，她送给他一只早餐用的搪须杯，上面有着王冠图案，是仿照德比的瓷器[147]。她照料着。四季结帐日[148] 或这先后，倘若他并非为了她而去购买什么东西，她就对他的需要表示关心，并能预料到他的希望。她钦佩他。当他为了她[149]而对自然现象做了说明时，她立即表示一种期望：不经过逐渐掌握就获得他那科学知识的一鳞半爪，二分之一，四分之一，千分之一。 \n \n 梦游病患者米莉之父--昼游病患者布卢姆，向夜游病患者斯蒂芬提出了什么建议？ \n \n 建议他在厨房楼上，紧挨着男主人与女主人的卧室那临时隔开的斗室里安歇，度过介于星期四（通称）、星期五（实名）之间的这几个小时。 \n \n 这样的临时措施的期间如果拖长了，能够产生或估计能产生哪些好处呢？ \n \n 对客人来说，能有个安定的住处和僻静的用功场所。对男主人来说，有助于才智的年轻化，替身能给他带来满足[150]。对女主人来说，能摆脱胡思乱想， 学到正确的意大利发音。 \n \n 何以一位客人与女主人之间可能有的几度机缘，并不排除一个同学和一个犹太人的女儿[151] 最终有可能永久地和睦结合，而且也不会被这种结合所排除？ \n \n 因为通往女儿的路要经过母亲，而通往母亲的路要经过女儿。 \n \n 对男主人的哪一句有一搭没一搭的多音节的询问，客人做了单音节的否定的答复？ \n \n 他认不认识已故埃米莉·辛尼柯太太[152]？ 一九0三年十月十四日，她因车祸死于悉尼广场车站。 \n \n 主人把刚要开口提到的什么有关事由终于又咽了回去？ \n \n 对于一九0三年六月二十六日他未能出席玛丽·迪达勒斯（原姓古尔丁）的葬礼的事由做了一番解释。因为那天正好碰上鲁道尔夫·布卢姆（原姓维拉格）忌日的前夕。 \n \n 提供暂时栖身之所的建议被接受了吗？ \n \n 未加解释，十分感激，友好地当即谢绝了。 \n \n 主客之间在金钱方面打了些什么交道？ \n \n 前者还给后者一笔钱（一英镑七先令整），未付利息。那是后者借给前者的。 \n \n 彼此之间相互提出了些什么建议，接受了，又加以修改，被拒绝了，换个说法复述一遍，重新被接受，被认可，再次确认？ \n \n 根据预先安排，开始讲习意大利语课程。地点在受教者的住所。开始声乐讲习课程，地点在女教师的住所。开始一系列静止的、半静止的、逍遥的、理性的对话，在对谈者双方家中（倘若对谈者双方住在同一处）；位于下阿贝街六号的“船记”饭店兼酒馆（经营者为W和E.康纳里），基尔代尔街十一号的爱尔兰国立图书馆、霍利斯街二十九、三十与三十一号的国立妇产医院，一座公共花园，礼拜堂附近，两条或更多的街道交叉点，连接双方住宅的直线的中点（倘若交谈者各住一处）。 \n \n 使布卢姆感到这些相互排斥的建议难以实现的理由是什么？ \n \n 过去的事是已经不可挽回的了。有一回艾伯特·亨格勒马戏团在都柏林市拉特兰广场的圆形建筑[153]里演出，一名富于机智的小丑身穿色彩斑驳的服装， 为了寻找乃父，竟走出马戏场，钻进观众席中，来到孤零零地坐着的布卢姆跟前，在大庭广众之下，向兴奋不已的观众公开宣称：他（布卢姆）是他（小丑）的爸爸。未来是不可预测的。一八九八年夏天，有一次他（布卢姆）在一枚弗洛林银币（值二先令）周围的饰纹上刻下三条道道，付给大运河查利蒙特林荫路一号的J与T. 戴维父子食品店，以便试验一下该货币经过市民钱财交易的流通过程，直接或间接地回到自己手中的可能性。 \n \n 那个小丑是布卢姆的儿子吗？ \n \n 不是。 \n \n 那枚银市又回到布卢姆手里来了吗？ \n \n 再也没有回来。 \n \n 接连遭到的挫折何以越发使他闷闷不乐？ \n \n 因为在人类生活关键性的转折时刻，他渴望改善种种社会情况，而那是不平等、贪欲和国与国之间抗争的产物。 \n \n 那么他是否相信，消除了这些条件后，人的生活就能无限地接近完美无缺呢？ \n \n 截然不同于人为的法则，这里依然存在着按照自然的法则作为对维持整个人类的生存不可分割的部分加诸于人的生物学之基本条件。为了获得有营养的食品，就不得不进行破坏性的杀戮。孤立的个人生存中终极机能那充满了苦恼的性质。生与死的痛苦。类人猿和（尤其是）人类女性那单调的月经，自初潮期一直延续到闭经期。海洋上、矿山和工厂里那些不可避免的事故；某些非常痛苦的疾病以及伴随而来的外科手术；生来的疯颠，先天性犯罪癖；导致人口大批死亡的传染病；在人类心灵深处种下恐怖种子的灾难性特大洪水；震中位于人口密集地区的大地震；历经剧烈变形，自幼年经过成熟期进入衰退期的生命成长的事实。 \n \n 他为什么打消了推断猜想的念头？ \n \n 因为摆在不同凡响的智者面前的课题就是排除不大适宜接受的现象，而代之以更适宜接受的现象。 \n \n 对他这样气馁，斯蒂芬表示共鸣了吗？ \n \n 他强调了自己作为有意识、有理性的动物，从已知的世界演绎地向未知的世界前进的意义，以及作为有意识、有理性的反应者，介于不可避免地建立在不安定的虚空之上的大宇宙与小宇宙[ 154] 之间的意义。 \n \n 布卢姆理解他强调的是什么吗？ \n \n 不是照字面上，而是从实质上理解的。 \n \n 对理解不足这一点，他是用什么来安慰自己的？ \n \n 作为一个没有钥匙却有能力的市民，他通过不安定的虚空，从未知的世界精力充沛地朝着已知的世界前进。 \n \n 他们是以怎样的先后顺序离开“为奴之家”[155] ，来到无人居住的旷野的，并举行了什么样的仪式呢？ \n \n 把点燃的蜡烛插在烛台上 \n \n 持者为 \n \n 布卢姆 \n \n 把助祭帽挑在梣木手杖上 \n \n 持者为 \n \n 斯蒂芬 \n \n 念诵的是《诗篇》哪一纪念性篇章？是用哪段默祷[156] 作起句的？ \n \n 第一一三篇，旅途：以色列人一离开埃及，雅各的子孙一离开异族的土地……[157] \n \n 他们各自在出口做了些什么？ \n \n 布卢姆把烛台放在地板上。斯蒂芬把帽子戴在头上。 \n \n 对什么动物来说，出口就是人口？ \n \n 猫。 \n \n 当主人领先，客人随后，两个黑魆魆的身姿默默地穿过房后昏暗的雨道，步入半明半暗的庭园中时，他们面对的是什么样的景物？ \n \n 天树上坠满了湿漉漉的夜蓝色的累累星果。 \n \n 布卢姆一边对伙伴指点着形形色色的星座，一边向他表达了哪些冥想？ \n \n 关于宇宙日益扩大进化的冥想：新月期的月亮，即使在近地点[158] 也看不见。从地表向地轴挖掘纵深五千英尺的圆筒状垂直轴，一个观察者呆在轴底儿上，就连白昼也辨认得出那漫无止境、网络状、亮光闪闪、非凝结性的银河[159]。 天狼（大犬座阿尔法）距地球十光年（五七、000、000、000、000英里）；体积大于地球九百倍；大角[160] ；岁差运动[161] ；有着“猎户”腰带、六倍于太阳的“伐二”以及星云的猎户座，星云中能容纳我们的一百个太阳系[162] ；死去的和新生的星宿，例如一九0 一年的那颗“新星”[163] 我们的太阳系正朝着武仙座冲去[164] ；所谓恒星的视差或视差移动[165] ，也就是说，实际上恒星是在不断地从无限遥远的太古朝无限遥远的未来移动着。相形之下，人的寿命充其量才七十年，不过是无限短暂的一段插曲而已。 \n 另外还有关于反过来逐渐缩小退化的冥想吗？ \n \n 在地球的层理[166] 留下记录的太古以来的地质时代。隐藏在大地的洞穴里和能移动的石头底下、蜂巢和土墩子中那无数微小的昆虫类的有机生物：微生物、病菌、细菌、杆菌、精子；凭着分子的亲和之凝聚力而粘在一根针尖上那几万几亿几兆个多不胜数、肉眼看不到的微小颗粒；人类的血浆是一个宇宙，群集着白血球和红血球，每个血球又各自形成一个空虚的宇宙空间，群集着其他球体；各个球体连续性地也是由可分割的构成体形成的宇宙，各个构成体又可以分割成为几个能够进一步分割的构成体。就这样，分子与分母实际上在并未分割的情况下就不断地减少了。如果这个过程延续到一定时候，就永远在任何地方也不会达到零。 \n \n 他为什么不精心计算出更准确的结果？ \n \n 因为几年前在一八八六年，当他埋头于探讨面积等于一个圆的正方形[167] 的问题时，他发现了一个数值的存在：倘若精确地计算到某种程度， 就能达到比方说九九乘九乘这样庞大的量值和位数[168] 。所得数字要用细字密密匝匝地印刷成三十三卷，每卷一千页。为了统统印刷完毕，就需要购入无数刀、无数令印度纸，整数值的位数便是一、十、百、千、万、十万、百万、千万、亿、十亿，一切级数的一切数字作为星云的核心，以简明的形式所包含的累乘的可能性推到了极限地、能动地开展的一切乘方的一切幂级数。 \n \n 他可曾发现分为几个种族的人类在其他行星及其卫星上居住的可能性，以及由一位救世主从社会上、伦理上拯救人类的可能性；那样一来问题会不会就更容易得到解决？ \n \n 他认为那是另一范畴的难题。人体组织通常能够抗得住十九吨的气压[ 169] ，可是一旦在地球的大气层里上升到相当的高度，越是接近对流层与平流层的境界线，鼻孔出血、吸呼困难以及眩晕，随着算术级数就越发严重起来。他晓得这一点，寻求解答时就设想出这样一个难以证明是不可能的行之有效的假定：倘若换个更富于适应性，解剖学上的构造也有所不同的种族，说不定就能在火星、水星、金星、木星、土星、海王星或天王星那充足而相同的条件下生存下来。然而那个远地点[170] 的人类种族，尽管在构造方面与地球上的人类有着一定限度的不同之处，整个来说彼此却有着相似的种种形态。他们恐怕也和地球上的人类一样，会不肯舍弃那一成不变、无法分割的属性，也就是对空虚，对空虚的空虚，一切都是空虚[ 171]的执着。 \n \n 至于拯救的可能性呢？ \n \n 小前提已经被大前提所证明了。 \n \n 接着他又依次对各个星座的哪些形形色色的特征进行了考虑呢？ \n \n 显示出不同程度之生命力的缤纷色彩（白、浅黄、深红、朱红、银朱）；诸星之亮度；一直包括到七等星、以等级标志的诸星之大小；诸星的位置；御夫座；沃尔辛厄姆路[172] ；大卫的战车[ 173] ；土星光环；螺旋星云凝固后形成有卫星的恒星群；两重大阳相互依存的旋转运动；伽利略、西蒙·马里乌斯[174] 、皮亚齐[175] 、勒威耶、赫歇耳、加勒[176] 等人各自独立地同时所做的发现；波得和开普勒所尝试的距离的立方与回转次数的平方的体系化[177] ；多毛的众彗星[178] 那几殆无限的被压缩性，以及自近日点至远日点那广漠的远心的重返大气层的椭圆轨道；陨石的恒星之起源；年纪较轻的天体观测者诞生的那个时期火星上所出现的“暗波”现象[ 179] ；每年在圣劳伦斯节（殉教者，八月十日）前后降落的陨石雨；每月都发生的所谓“新月抱旧月”现象[180] ；关于天体对人体的影响的假定；威廉·莎士比亚出生的时期，在斜倚却永不没落的仙后座那三角形上端，一颗不分昼夜散发着极亮光彩的星辰（一等星）出现了[ 181] （这是两个无光、死灭了的太阳因相撞并汞合为白热体而形成的灿烂的新太阳）；大约在利奥波德·布卢姆出生时，出现在七星花冠星座里而后又消失了的一颗同一起源、亮度却稍逊的星宿（二等星）[ 182] ；还有约于斯蒂芬·迪达勒斯出生时，出现在仙女座中之后又消失，小鲁道尔夫·布卢姆出生与夭折数年后出现于御夫座后又消失，以及另外一些人出生或去世前前后后出现在许许多多其他星座中而又消失了的、（假定是）同一起源的（实际存在或假定存在的）星斗[ 183] 。日蚀及月蚀自隐蔽至复现的各种伴随现象：诸如风势减弱，影子推移，有翼者沉默下来，夜行或暮行动物的出现，冥界的光持续不减，地上的江河溪流之幽暗，人类之苍白。 \n \n 对情况进行了估量并考虑过产生错误的可能性之后，他（布卢姆）得出过什么样的合乎逻辑的结论呢？ \n \n 那既不是天树、天洞，也不是天兽、天人。那是个乌托邦，那里不存在自己知到未知的既知之路。那是无限的。假定各个天体有可能并存，那么也能把它看作是有限的。天体的数目是一个还是一个以上都无所谓，体积相同或不同也无所谓。那是一团能活动的幻觉形态，是在空间里已固定下来的东西，借着空气又重新活动起来。它是过去，未来的观察者们作为现在实际存在之前，它或许已不再作为现在而存在了。 \n \n 关于这一光景的美的价值，他更加深信不疑了吗？ \n \n 毫无疑问。因为有这样一些先例：诗人们往往在狂热的恋慕导致的谵妄状态下，要么就是在失恋的屈辱中，向热情而持好感的诸星座或围着地球转的冷漠的卫星呼吁。 \n \n 那么他曾否把占星术对地上灾害的影响这一理论当作信条接受下来了呢？ \n \n 据他看来，对这一点提出论证和反证的可能性是一样大的。月面图中所使用的梦沼、雨海、湿海、丰富海等学术用语既可以归之于直观的产物，也可以归之于谬误的类推。 \n \n 他认为月亮和妇女之间有什么特殊的近似之处？ \n \n 她历史悠久：地球上连绵不断的世世代代存在之前她就存在，并将继续存在下去。她在夜间的优势。她作为卫星的依存性。她反射光的性能；起落盈亏，运行有常，恒久不变。她的容貌注定永不改变。她对不明确的讯问，都给以暧昧的答复。她能够支配潮汐涨落。她具有使人迷恋，心碎，赋予美，逼人发疯[184] ，煽动并助长人们为非作歹的种种本事。她的表情那么安详而秘不可测。她孑然一身，居高临下，毫不留情，光彩夺目，令人望而生畏，不敢挨近。她预示着暴风雨或天朗气清。她焕发出的光芒，她那一举一动与存在都给人以刺激。她的喷火口，她那枯竭的海，她的沉默，在在都发出警告。看得见时，她是何等光辉灿烂，看不见时，她又是何等富于魅力。 \n \n 哪一样看得见的明亮标志映入了布卢姆的眼帘，他又提醒斯蒂芬去注视了呢？ \n \n 在他（布卢姆）家的二楼（后身），点起了一盏煤油灯，一个倾斜的人影投到卷式百叶帘上；那是在安吉尔街十六号开业的百叶窗、帘杆、卷式帘制造商弗兰克·奥哈拉供应的。 \n \n 关于由看得见的明亮标志（一盏灯）所映照出来的那位看不见的富于魅力的人儿，也就是说，他的妻子玛莉恩（摩莉）·布卢姆之谜，他是怎样阐明的呢？ \n \n 直接间接口头暗示或明确地表达。用那抑制着的挚爱和赞美之情。加以描绘。结结巴巴地。凭着暗示。 \n \n 接着，两个人都沉默下去了吗？ \n \n 沉默下去了。他们相互用自己肉身的镜子照着伙伴的脸。彼此在镜中照见的是对方的，而不是自己的脸。 \n \n 他们一直毫无动静吗？ \n \n 经斯蒂芬提议，并在布卢姆的鼓动下，先由斯蒂芬带头，布卢姆紧接着，双双在幽暗中各撤了一泡尿。他们肩并肩，彼此用手圈着自己的排尿器官，以便挡住对方的视线。随后由布卢姆带头，斯蒂芬紧接着，双双抬头抑望起那明亮的和半明亮的投影。 \n \n 相似吗？ \n \n 他们二人那起初有先有后，继而同时撤出去的尿的轨道并不相似。布卢姆的较长，滋得没那么冲，形状有点像那分叉的倒数第二个字母[185] ，却又有所不同。敢情，他念高中最后一年（一八八0） 的时候，曾有本事对抗全校二百十名学生拧成的那股力量，尿撒得比谁都高。斯蒂芬的尿滋得更冲，咝咝响得更欢势。由于头天最后几个钟头他喝了利尿物，膀胱持续地受到压迫。 \n \n 对方那个看不见却听得见的附属器官，使两个人各自联想到了什么不同的问题？ \n \n 布卢姆：过敏性、勃起、变硬挺直、松弛、大小、卫生、阴毛等等问题。斯蒂芬：受割礼的耶稣作为圣职者是否毫无缺陷的问题（一月一日乃是圣日，应该望弥撒，不得从事不必要的世俗劳动）[186] 。还有如何对待保存在卡尔卡塔的神圣罗马天主教使徒教会的肉体结婚戒指——神圣的包皮问题。应仅仅向它致以对圣母的最高崇敬呢，抑或该把它作为毛发、脚趾甲那样从神体上割下来的赘生物，对它致以第四级最高膜拜[187] ？ \n \n 他们两人同时观测到了什么样的天象？ \n \n 一颗星星从天顶上天琴座“织女一”越过后发星座[188] 的星群，明显地以高速度朝着黄道十二宫的狮子宫[189] 直冲过去。 \n \n 向心的滞留者是怎样为离心的出发者提供出口的？ \n \n 他将生锈粗涩的男性型钥匙轴捅进反复无常的女性型锁孔里，把劲头使在钥匙环上，自右至左地转动钥匙的齿凹，将锁簧送回到锁环里，痉挛般地把那扇铰链都掉了的旧门朝里面拽过来，露出可以任意出进的门口。 \n \n 临分手时，他们是怎样彼此道别的？ \n \n 他们直直地站在同一道门坎的两侧，告别时两只胳膊的曲线在某一点上随便相碰，形成小于二直角之和这样一个角度。 \n \n 伴随着他们那相接触的手的结合，他们（各自）那离心的和向心的手的分离，传来了什么响声？ \n \n 圣乔治教堂那组钟鸣报起深夜的时辰，响彻着谐和的音调。 \n \n 他们各自都听到了钟声，分别有什么样的回音？ \n \n 斯蒂芬听见的是： \n \n 饰以百合的光明的司铎群来伴尔， \n \n 极乐圣童贞之群高唱赞歌来迎尔[ 190]。 \n \n 布卢姆听见的是： \n \n 叮当！叮当！ \n \n 叮当！叮当[191]！ \n \n 那一天随着钟声的呼唤跟布卢姆结伴从南边的沙丘前往北边的葛拉斯涅文的一行人，而今都在何处？ \n \n 马丁·坎宁翰（在床上），杰克·鲍尔（在床上），西蒙·迪达勒斯（在床上），内德·兰伯特（在床上），汤姆·克南（在床上），乔·海因斯（在床上），约翰·亨利·门顿（在床上），伯纳德·利里根[ 192] （在床上），帕齐·迪格纳穆（在床上），帕狄·迪格纳穆（在墓中）。 \n \n 只剩下布卢姆一个人之后，他听到了什么？ \n \n 沿着上天所生的大地退去的脚步声发出来的双重回荡，以及犹大人所奏的竖琴在余音缭绕的小径上引起的双重反响[193]。 \n \n 只剩下布卢姆一个人了，他有什么感觉？ \n \n 星际空间的寒冷，冰点以下几千度或华氏、摄氏或列氏的绝对零度[194] ，即将迎来黎明的最早兆头。 \n \n 音调谐和的钟声、手的感触、脚步声和孤独寒冷使他联想起了什么？ \n \n 在各种情况下，在不同的地方如今已经故去的伙伴们：珀西·阿普约翰（阵亡，在莫德尔河[195] ）、菲利普·吉利根[196] （肺结核，殁于杰维斯街医院），马修·F. 凯恩[197]（不慎淹死在都柏林港湾），菲利普·莫依塞尔[198] （脓血症，死在海蒂斯勃利街），迈克尔·哈特[199]（肺结核，殁于仁慈圣母医院），帕特里克·迪格纳穆（脑溢血，殁于沙丘）。 \n \n 是何种现象的何种前景促使他留在原地？ \n \n 最后三颗星的消失，曙光四射，一轮新的盘状太阳喷薄欲出[200] 。 \n \n 以前他可曾目击过这样的现象? \n \n 一八八七年，有一次在基玛吉[210] 的卢克·多伊尔家玩猜哑剧字谜，时间拖得很长。这之后，他坐在一堵墙上，注视着东方——米兹拉赤[202] ，耐心地等待黎明景象的出现。 \n \n 他想起最初的种种现象了吗？ \n \n 空气越发充满了勃勃生机：远处，公鸡在报晓，各座教堂的敲钟声，鸟类的音乐，早起的行人那孤零零的脚步声，看不见的光体所射出的看得见的光，复活了的太阳那低低地崭露在地平线上的、依稀可辨的最初一抹金晖。 \n \n 他在那儿滞留下去了吗？ \n \n 在强烈灵感的触发下，他折了回去，再一次跨过园子，返回门道，重新关上门。一声短叹，他再度拿起烛台，又一次登上楼梯，重新朝那挨着一楼门厅的屋子踱过去，走回原来的地方。 \n \n 是什么乍然拦住了他正往里走的脚步呢？ \n \n 他的天灵盖右颞叶碰着了坚硬的木材犄角，在微乎其微却能有所察觉的几分之一秒后，产生了疼痛感。这是一刹那之前传达因而觉察到的结果。 \n \n 描述一下在室内陈设方面所做的变更。 \n \n 一把深紫红色长毛绒面沙发从门对面被搬到炉边那面卷得紧紧的英国国旗近旁（这是他曾多次打算要做的变动）。那张嵌有篮白棋盘格子花纹的马略尔卡[203]瓷面桌子，被安放在深紫红色长毛绒面沙发腾出后的空处。胡桃木餐具柜（是它那凸出来的犄角一时挡住了他往里走着的脚步）从门旁的位置被挪到更便当却更危险、正对着门的位置去了。两把椅子从壁炉左右两侧被搬到嵌有蓝白棋盘格子花纹的马略尔卡瓷面桌子原先所占的位置去。 \n \n 描述一下那两把椅子。 \n \n 一把低矮，是填了稻草的安乐椅。结实的扶手伸向前，靠背朝后边倾斜着。方才把它往后推的时候，长方形地毯那不整齐的边儿给掀了起来。罩着宽大面子的坐位，中间的颜色褪得厉害，越靠近边沿，越没怎么变色。与它相对的另一把细细溜溜、撇着两双八字脚的藤椅是由有光泽的曲线构成的。椅架从顶部到坐位，又从坐位到底部，整个儿都涂着暗褐色清漆，坐位则用白色灯心草鲜明地盘成圆形。 \n \n 这两把椅子有着什么意义？ \n \n 表示着类似、姿势、象征、间接证据和永久不变的证言等等意义[204] 。 \n \n 原先放餐具柜的地方，如今摆着什么？ \n \n 一架立式钢琴（凯德拜牌[205] ），键盘露在外面。上顶盖关得严严实实，摆着一双淡黄色妇女用长手套，一只鲜绿色烟灰缸里是四根燃尽了的火柴，一根吸过一截的香烟，还有两截变了色的烟蒂。谱架上斜搭着一本《古老甜蜜的情歌》（G.克利夫顿·宾厄姆作词，詹·莱·莫洛伊配曲，安托瓦内特·斯特林[206]夫人演唱）G大调歌曲 \n \n 1080伴奏谱，在摊开来的最后一页上可以看到演奏的终指示：随意地，响亮地，持续音，活泼地，要延长的持续音，渐慢[207]，终止。 \n \n 布卢姆是抱着何等激情依次打量这些物件的？ \n \n 他心情紧张地举着烛台，感到疼痛伸手摸了摸肿胀起来的右颞叶撞伤处。他全神贯注地凝视着那庞大笨重被动的和那细溜活泼主动的，又殷勤地弯下身去，把掀起来的地毯边儿舒展成原样。他兴致勃勃地记起玛拉基·穆利根博士的色彩计划，其中包括深浅有致的绿色[208] 。他又心怀喜悦之情重复着当时相互间的话语和动作，并通过内部种种感官，领悟着逐渐褪色所导致的温吞快感的舒散。 \n \n 他的下一个行动是什么？ \n \n 他从马略尔卡瓷面桌子上的一个敞着的盒子里取出个一英寸高、又小又黑的松果，将其圆底儿放在小小的锡盘上。然后把他的烛台摆在壁炉台右角上，从背心里掏出一张卷起来的简介（附有插图），题名“阿根达斯·内泰穆”[209] 。打开来，大致浏览了一下，又将它卷成细长的圆筒，在烛火上引燃了。于是，圆筒的火苗伸到松果尖端，直到后者发出红色火光；并将纸筒撂在烛台托子上，让剩下的那部分燃烧殆尽。 \n \n 这一行动之后，又发生了什么？ \n \n 从小小火山那烧掉了尖儿的圆锥型火口，一股令人联想到东方香烟的垂直的蛇状熏烟袅袅上升[210] 。 \n \n 除了烛台，壁炉台上还摆了些什么类似的物件？ \n \n 还有竖纹的康尼马拉大理石[211] 做的座钟。这是马修·狄龙送的结婚礼物，它停在一八九六年三月二十一日上午四点四十六分上[212] 。透明的钟形罩子里是冰状结晶矮树盆景，那是卢克和卡罗琳·多伊尔[213] 送的结婚礼物。一只制成标本的猫头鹰，是市政委员约翰·胡珀[214] 送的结婚礼物。 \n \n 这三样东西和布卢姆是怎样相互望着的？ \n \n 在镶金边的穿衣镜里，矮树那未装饰的背望着制成标本的猫头鹰那直直的脊背。在镜子前面，市政委员约翰·胡珀送的结婚礼物以清澈忧郁、聪慧明亮、一动不动、体恤同情的视线盯着布卢姆，布卢姆则以模糊安详、意味深长、一动不动、富于恻隐之心的视线，瞅着卢克和卡罗琳·多伊尔所赠结婚礼物。 \n \n 映在镜中的什么混合的不对称的影象这时引起了他的注意？ \n \n 一个（就自己而言）落落寡合，（对别人）反复无常的人的影象。 \n \n 为什么落落寡合（就自己而言）？ \n \n 他一个兄弟姐妹都没有， \n \n 但他爹仍是爷爷的儿子。 \n \n 为什么反复无常（对别人）？ \n \n 自襁褓时期到壮年，他与母系的骨肉至亲相像。自壮年到衰老期，他会越来越与父系的骨肉至亲相像。 \n \n 镜子传达给他的最终视觉印象是什么？ \n \n 由于光学反射，可以看到映在镜中的对面那两个书架上颠倒放着若干册书。它们不是按照字母顺序排列着的，而是胡乱放的。标题闪闪发光。 \n \n 为这些书编个目录。 \n \n 《汤姆的都柏林邮政局人名录》，一八八六年版。 \n \n 丹尼斯·弗洛伦斯·麦卡锡[215] ：《诗集》（第五页夹着古铜色椈叶状书签）。 \n \n 莎士比亚：《作品集》（深红色摩洛哥山羊皮，烫金封面）。 \n \n

当他把上下颠倒的书重新调整过来的时候，心里有些什么感想？ \n \n 需要秩序。一切东西都应各有个位置，并且应该各就各位。女性对文学的鉴赏力之不足。苹果塞在玻璃酒杯里，或雨伞斜搭在马桶里，均不协调。把任何秘密文件放在书籍后面、下面或夹在书页间，都是不安全的。 \n \n 体积最大的是哪本书？ \n \n 霍齐尔的《俄土战争史》。 \n \n 在这部著作第二部的其他事项中，还包括些什么内容？ \n \n 一次关键性战役的名字（他已忘记），一位念念不忘该战役的关键性军官，即布赖恩·库帕·特威迪鼓手长（他铭记心头）。 \n \n 由于第一和第二个什么缘故，他并不曾查阅这部著作? \n \n 第一、为了锻炼记忆术。第二、因为犯了一阵健忘症之后，当他对着中央的桌子而坐，正要去查阅那部著作时，凭着记忆术他回想起了那次战斗的名称：普列文[231] 。 \n \n 他端坐着时，何物给他带来了慰藉？ \n \n 竖立在桌子中央的一座雕像那率真，裸体，姿势，安详，青春，优雅，性，劝告。这座纳希素斯像[232] 是从巴切勒步道九号的P. A. 雷恩拍卖行买来的。 \n \n 他端坐着时，何物令他心头焦躁？ \n \n 硬领（十六英寸型）和背心（有五颗纽扣）紧得使他感到压力。这两样东西对成年男子的服装来说是多余的，而对人体的膨胀所引起的容积变更却又缺乏弹性。 \n \n 心头的焦躁是怎样平息下来的？ \n \n 他从脖间摘下硬领、黑领带和折叠式饰钮，放在桌子左角。然后又反过来自下而上地依次解开背心、长裤、衬衫和内衣纽扣。他那双手的轨迹从参差不齐、卷缩起皱的黑色体毛的中心线——也就是自骨盆底到下腹部肚脐眼周围那一簇簇体毛，又沿着节结的中心线进而延伸到第六胸脊椎的交叉点，从这里又向两侧丛生，构成直角形，在左右等距离的两个点，即环绕乳头顶端形成的三角形收敛图形的中心线——穿行。长裤的背带上钉着成双的六颗纽扣（其中缺了一颗），他依次解开那六颗（其中少了一颗）纽扣。 \n \n 接着，他又不由自主地做了什么？ \n \n 他用两个手指捏起两星期零三天前（一九0 四年五月二十三日）横膈膜下左侧腹那因挨蜜蜂蛰而留下的伤痕周围的肉。尽管并不觉得痒，他却用左手这儿那儿地胡乱挠了挠全部洗净、只裸露出一部分的皮肤的点和面。他把左手伸进背心的左下兜，掏出一枚银币（一先令），又放了回去。（大概是）参加悉尼广场的埃米莉·辛尼柯太太[233] 的葬礼（一九0 三年十月十六日）时放进去的。 \n \n 制订一九0 四年六月十六日的收支表。 \n \n 支出 收入 \n \n 镑 先令 便士 现金 镑 先令 便士 \n \n 猪腰子（一副） 0 0 3 0 4 9 \n \n 《自由人报》（一份） 0 0 1 《自由人报》 1 7 6 \n \n 广告手续费 \n \n 入浴及小费（一份） 0 1 6电车票 0 0 1 借款（斯蒂芬. 1 7 0 \n

他感到脚心一个劲儿地隐隐作痛，就把脚伸到一旁，端详着脚由于一趟趟地朝不同的方向走来走去，受到挤压而磨出的皱皮、硬块和疖子。随后他弯下身去，解起打成结子的靴带：先掰搭钩，松开靴带，再一次一只只地脱下靴子[235]。右边那只短袜湿了一部分，大脚趾甲又把前面捅破并伸了出去，这下于便跟靴子分开了。他抬起右脚，摘下紫色的松紧袜带后，扒下右面那只袜子，将赤着的右脚放在椅屉儿上，用手指去撕扯长得挺长的大拇脚趾甲，并轻轻地把它拽掉，还举至到鼻子那儿， 嗅嗅自己肉体的气味，然后就心满意足地丢掉从趾甲上扯下来的这一碎片。 \n \n 为什么感到心满意足？ \n \n 因为他嗅到的这股气味，跟他当年作为布卢姆公子在埃利斯太太的幼儿学校[236]做学生的时候所嗅到的另外一些趾甲碎片的气味相似。那是他每晚跪在那儿，一边做短短的晚祷并沉浸在野心勃勃的冥想中，一边耐心地撕扯并拽下来的。 \n \n 同时连续地产生的所有那些野心，如今合并成为怎样一种终极的野心呢？ \n \n 他并不想根据长子继承制、男子平分继承制或末子继承制[237] ，把那幢有着门房和马车道的男爵宅邪及其周围那一大片辽阔的英亩、路得和平方杆[238]法定土地面积单位，（估价为四十二英镑[239]的泥炭质牧场地，或者那座被描述为“都会中的田园[240]” 或“健康庄[242]”的有阳台的房子或一侧与邻屋相接的别墅，继承下来并永久占有。他只巴望根据私人合同购买一所继承人身分不受限制的不动产：要坐北朝南的一座草屋顶、有凉台的双层住宅，房顶上装起风向标以及与地面相接的避雷针，门廊上要爬满寄生植物（常春藤或五叶地锦），橄榄绿色的正门最后一道工序漆得漂漂亮亮，赛得过马车。门上有着精巧的黄铜装饰。房屋正面是灰泥墁的，屋檐和山墙涂着金色网眼花纹。尽可能让房子耸立在坡度不大的高台上，从那圈着石柱栏杆的阳台上，隔着现在空着、将来也不得占用的牧场地，可以聎望四周的一片好景致。单是自己的庭园，就有五、六英亩之谱。它与最近的公路的距离适度：夜晚从修剪得整整齐齐的鹅耳枥树篱上端和缝隙间，可以瞥见室内的灯光，从首都边界的任何地点丈量，与这所房子相距至少也有法定一英里。不出十五分钟[242] 就可以轰“电车或火车铁道沿线。（例如往南去登德鲁姆或往北去萨顿[243]，就像是南北两极。经过验证，据说这两处气候都适合肺结核患者。）凭着继承人身分不受限制的不动产转让证拥有房屋和地基，租借期限为九百九十九年[244]。宅邸里包括一间有着凸窗（两扇尖头窗）的客厅（装有寒暑表），一间起居室，四间卧室，两间仆役室。砌了瓷砖的厨房里还安装了多用途的铁灶和洗涤台，休息厅里备有放亚麻布床单衬衫用的壁橱，分成几层的氨熏橡木书柜，放着《大英百科全书》和《新世纪辞典），横陈着一把把中世纪或东洋的古老刀剑；还有通知开饭的锣，雪花石膏做的灯，悬垂着的饰钵，附有电话号码簿的胶木自动电话听筒；手织的阿克斯明斯特地毯[245]，是奶油色质地，周围镶着棋盘图案。有着兽爪形柱脚的牌桌。壁炉装着大型黄铜格栅，炉台上摆着精密的镀金计时表，准确无误地发出大教堂那样的钟声，附有湿度计的晴雨表，蒙着鲜红色长毛绒面子、装着上等弹簧、中心部位富于弹性的舒适的长靠椅和放在角落里的备用椅，日本式三扇屏风，痰盂（俱乐部里摆的那种，用深紫红色皮革制成，只要用亚麻子油和醋一擦，不费吹灰之力就能发出光泽，焕然一新。）室中央悬挂一盏金字塔式枝形吊灯，射出灿烂的光辉。一截弯木上栖着一只驯顺得能停在手指上的鹦鹉（它吐字文雅），墙上糊着每打价为十先令的压花壁纸，印着胭脂红色垂花横纹图案，顶端是带状装饰；一连三段栎木楼梯，接连两次拐成直角，都用清漆涂出清晰的木纹，梯级、登板、起柱、栏杆和扶手，一律用护板来加固并涂上含樟脑的蜡；浴室里有冷热水管，盆汤、淋浴，设备俱全。位于平台[246]上的厕所里，长方形窗子上嵌着一块毛玻璃，带盖的坐式抽水马桶，壁灯，黄铜拉链和把手，两侧各放着凭肘几和脚凳，门内侧还挂有艺术气息浓厚的油画式石版画。另外还有一间普通的厕所；厨师、打杂的女仆和兼做些细活的女佣的下房里也分别装有保健卫生设备（仆役的工钱每两年递增两英镑，并根据一般忠诚勤劳保险，每年年底发奖金一英镑，对工龄满三十年者，按照六十五岁退职的规定，发退职金）；餐具室、配膳室、食品库、冷藏库、主楼外的厨房及贮藏室等、堆煤柴用的地窨子里还有个葡萄酒窖（不起泡、亮光闪闪的葡萄酒），这是为宴请贵宾吃正餐（身穿夜礼服）时预备的。对整座楼房都供应一氧化碳瓦斯。 \n \n 在这片地基上还可能增添些什么具有吸引力的设备？ \n \n 可以增添一个网球兼手球场，一片灌木丛，用植物学上最佳办法设置一座热带椰子科植物的玻璃凉亭，有喷泉装置的假山石，按照人道的原则设计的蜂窝。在矩形的草坪上布置一座座椭圆形花坛，将深红和淡黄两色的郁金香、蓝色的天蒜、报春花、西樱草、美洲石竹、香豌豆花和欧钤兰都栽培成别致的卵形（球根购自詹姆斯·W·马凯伊爵士[247]的股份有限公司，他是个种籽与球根批发兼零售商，苗木培养工，化学肥料代理商，住在上萨克维尔街二十三号）。果树园、蔬菜园和葡萄园各一座。为了防备非法人侵者，围墙上插满碎玻璃片。一间挂了锁的杂物棚，放置形形色色登记入册的用具。 \n \n 例如？捕鳗笼、捕虾器、钓鱼竿、手斧、杆秤、磨石、碎土器、翻谷机、暖足袋[248]、折叠式梯子、十齿耙、洗衣用木靴、干草撒散机、旋转耙、钩镰、颜料钵、刷子、灰耙等等。 \n \n 设备还能进一步做何改善？ \n \n 一座养兔场和养鸡场，一座鸽棚，植物的温室，一对吊床（太太用的和先生用的），金链花树或丁香花树遮荫并掩蔽下的日晷，装在左边大门柱上的日本门铃奏着异国情调的悦耳玎玲声，巨大的雨水桶，侧面有着排出孔和接草箱的刈草机，附有胶皮管的草坪洒水器。 \n \n 希望使用什么样的交通工具？ \n \n 进城的时候，就从最合适的中间站或终点站搭乘频频往返的火车或电车。下乡的时候，就骑老式脚踏车，挂有柳条编的车斗的无链飞轮跑车，要么就是牲口拉的车，柳条车身的二轮轻便驴车或是脚步矫健飞快的短腿壮马（骗过的灰斑栗毛马，身高十四掌尺[ 249] ）所拉的时髦的四轮轻便马车。 \n \n 这栋可望建造的或已建成的住房如何命名呢？ \n \n 布卢姆庄。圣利奥波得[250] 府。弗罗尔公馆。 \n \n 住在埃克尔斯街七号的布卢姆能够预见到弗罗尔公馆里的布卢姆如何情景吗？ \n \n 他身穿宽松纯毛衣服，头戴值八先令六便士的哈里斯花呢帽。在园子里脚上穿着实用长筒胶靴（里面衬了一层松紧布用以加固），手提喷水壶，培植着一排冷杉苗木。浇水，剪枝，用桩撑起，播种牧草种籽。日暮时分，在新割牧草的一片清香弥漫中，在不过分劳累下，推着那堆满了杂草的低矮的独轮车，改良着土壤，不断丰富着知识，获得长寿。 \n \n 同时还有可能从事哪几项智力方面的追求？ \n \n 摄影方面的抓拍技术，比较宗教学，有关色欲及迷信方面五花八门的习俗的民俗学，观察天空中的星座，沉思默想。 \n \n 从事哪些轻松的娱乐？ \n \n 户外：园艺和农活，在碎石铺成的平坦的人行道上骑车，攀登不太高的小山，在僻静的淡水里游泳，要么就划着安全的单人平底小船或带锚的柳条艇[251]在没有堰坝和激流的水域里自由自在地泛舟消夏。边观赏荒凉的景物和与之相映照的农家那令人心旷神怡的泥炭火冒出来的袅袅炊烟，边在傍晚漫步，或骑马巡行（以上为越冬期）。室内：在一片温煦的安宁中，探讨种种迄今尚未解决的历史方面或犯罪学方面的问题；讲解外国未经删节的色情名著；做家庭木工，工具箱里装着铁锤、锥子、铁钉、螺钉、图钉、螺丝锥、镊子、刨子和改锥。 \n \n 他能成为一位拥有农作物和牲畜的乡绅吗？ \n \n 并非不可能。有上一两头挤不出奶的母牛，一垛高地牧草和必要的农具，例如直流式搅乳桶和芜青搅碎机等等。 \n \n 在郡内的名门和乡绅当中，他拥有什么样的公民职能和社会地位？按照越往上权利越大的等级制度顺序，他曾经是园丁、庄稼人、耕作者、牲畜繁殖家；仕途的高峰是地方长官或治安推事。他拥有家徽和盾形纹章以及与之相称的拉丁文家训（时刻准备着），他的名字正式记载于宫廷人名录[252]中（布卢姆，利奥波德·保，下院议员，枢密顾问官，圣巴特里克勋级爵士[253]，名誉法学博士。登德鲁姆村布卢姆庄），在报纸上的宫廷及社交界栏中也被提及（例如：“利奥波德·布卢姆先生偕夫人自国王镇动身前往英国”云云）。拥有这样的地位，他打算采取什么样的行动方针呢？方针要介乎过分的宽大与过于苛刻之间。在这个有着不自然的等级制度、社会上的不平等不断地或增或减、变动不已、参差不齐的社会里，要实行公平、一视同仁、无可争辩的正义，也就是说，一方面尽可能广泛地采取宽大政策，另一方面又为王国政府锱铢必较地横征暴敛，包括没收动产及不动产。在对本国的最高宪法所规定的国家最高权力的一片忠诚和与生俱来的正义感的驱使之下，他所追求的目标就是严格地维护社会秩序，扫除各种弊端，然而并非齐头并进（每一项改革或紧缩措施都是初步的解决，经过融化吸收，导致最后的解决）。对一切串通起来进行抗辩者，一切条例和规章的违反者，一切试图恢复已废止并失效的文维尔权[254]者（如非法越界并盗伐柴禾），国际间一切迫害的高声煽动者，国际间一切仇恨的鼓吹者，一切对家庭欢聚的卑鄙的破坏者，一切对夫妻关系死不悔改的亵渎者，要严格执行一切法律（习惯法、成文法、商法）条文。 \n \n 证明一下他自幼就酷爱正直。 \n \n 一八八0年在高中就读时，他曾向少年珀西·阿普约翰吐露自己对爱尔兰（新教）教会的教义所持的怀疑。一八六五年，他父亲鲁道尔夫·维拉格（后改名鲁道尔夫·布卢姆）在“向犹大人传布基督教协会”的劝告下，放弃了对犹太教的信仰，脱离了该教派，改信新教。一八八八年为了能够结成婚，他又放弃了新教，皈依罗马天主教。一八八二年，他和丹尼尔·马格雷恩与弗朗西斯·韦德之间结下了青春时期的友谊（由于前者过早地移居外国而告终）。晚间散步时，他曾向那两人表示拥护开拓殖民地（例如加拿大）的政治理论，并赞成查尔斯·达尔文在《人类的由来》[255]和《物种起源》中所阐述的进化论。一八八五年，他公开表示支持詹姆斯·芬坦·拉勒、约翰·费希尔，默里、约翰·米哈伊、詹·弗·泽·奥布赖恩[256]以及其他人所倡导的集体的国民经济计划，迈克尔·达维特的农业方针，查理·斯图尔特。巴涅尔（科克市选出的下院议员）那符合宪法程序的煽动[257]威廉·尤尔特·格莱斯顿（北不列颠米德洛锡安[258]所选出的下院议员）的和平、紧缩与改革的方案。为了拥护其政治信念，他爬上诺桑勃兰德公路旁的一棵树，呆在杈桠间一个安全所在，观看了由两万名持火把者组成的游行队伍。游行者分作一百二十个同业公会，其中两千个持火把者护送着里彭侯爵[259]与约翰·莫利[260] （于一八八八年二月二日[261]）进入首都。 \n \n 他打算为这座庄园支付多少钱，用什么方式？ \n \n 根据勤劳外籍人员同化归化友好国家补助建筑协会（一八七四年成立）的章程，每年按最高额分期付款六十英镑，条件是不得超过能够从金边证券获得的可靠年收入的六分之一。此款相当于一千二百英镑（分二十年付款的房屋估价）本钱的五分单利。房屋到手后，同时付总价的三分之一，余额——也就是八百英镑外加二分五厘利息——每年分四季按同额偿付，二十年内全部还清。年额连本带利，相当于六十四英镑的房租钱。不动产权利书上还附加着条款：如上述款项逾期不交，则强制售出、执行抵押权或相互赔偿等。房地契由一至二、三个债权者保存，如无滞交情况，该座宅院届期即成为租房者的绝对所有财产。 \n \n 为了获得立即购买的财力，有什么迅速然而不安全的办法？ \n \n 在阿斯科特举办的全国障碍赛马（平地或越野赛）一英里或数英里英浪[262]的比赛中，下午三点八分（格林威治标准时间），一匹“黑马”以五十博一获胜。这一比赛结果由私设的无线电信机用一点一划相间的莫尔斯电码发报，下午两点五十九分（邓辛克[263]标准时间）在都柏林收到电文，根据这一情报可从事赌博。意外地发现一样非常值钱的东西：宝石，贵重的带胶邮票或盖了戳的邮票（七先令，淡紫色，无齿孔，汉堡，一八六六[264]；四便士，玫瑰色，蓝地上有齿孔，英国，一八五五[265]； 一法郎，黄褐色，官方印制，刻有骑缝孔的，斜着盖有加价印记，卢森堡，一八七八[266] 。古代王朝的戒指，稀世遗宝，在不同寻常的地方或以不同寻常的方式出现：从天而降（飞鹰丢下的），借着一场火（在焚毁成焦炭的大厦灰烬当中，大海里（在漂流物、失事船只的丢弃物、系上浮标投下水的货物以及无主物当中），在地面上（在食用禽的胗里）。接受一位西班牙囚犯所赠的遗产：那是一百年前从远方带来的财宝或硬币或金银块，以年五分的复利存入有偿付能力的银行后，总额连本带利己达英币五百万镑正。与一个粗心的订约者签订一份商业合同：作为三十二件商品的运送费，第一件只收四分之一便士，自第二件起，以二的几何级数递增（四分之一便士，二分之一便士，一便士，二便士，四便士，八便士，一先令四便士，二先令八便士，一直递增到第三十二件[ 267] ）。根据概率法则的研究而运用周密的赌博技术，足以使蒙特卡洛的赌场主破产[268] 。解决世上自古以来留下的难题：作与圆等积的正方形，并赢得政府颁发的一百万英镑奖金[269] 。 \n \n 通过工业渠道能发大财吗？ \n \n 靠桔园和瓜地的栽培以及重新造林来开发多少狄纳穆[270] 荒芜的砂质土地，参看柏林西十五区布莱布特留的移民垦殖公司的说明书。有效地利用废纸、水老鼠的毛皮、人粪中所包含的各种化学成分。值得注意的是第一样东西产量极大，第二样数量庞大，第三样无穷无尽，因为有着一般体力与食欲的正常人即使刨掉液体副产物，每个人每年排泄的总量也仍达八十磅（动物性及植物性食品相混杂），乘以4，386，035[271] 即可（根据一九0一年所做的普查表统计的爱尔兰人口总数）。 \n \n 有没有规模更大的计划？ \n \n 有个建造水力发电厂的计划：利用都柏林沙洲的满潮、噗啦呋咔[ 272] 或鲍尔斯考特瀑布[273] 的水位差、主要河流的流域来开发白煤（水力发电），经济生产五十万水马力的电力。拟好后，将提交港湾委员会，以便获得批准。筑一道堤坝，把多利山的北公牛那半岛状三角洲圈起[274]，用来修高尔夫球场和步枪打靶场，前面那片地上铺一条柏油散步路，两侧是赌博场、货摊、射击练习室、旅馆、公寓、阅览室和男女混合浴池。清晨计划使用狗车和山羊车送牛奶。为了发展都柏林市内和左近的爱尔兰旅游交通，计划建造一批内河汽轮，行驶于岛桥与林森德之间。大型游览汽车，窄轨地方铁道以及沿岸游览汽船（每人每日十先令，包括一位能操三国语言的导游）。为了恢复爱尔兰各条水路的旅客及货运，订立疏浚海底海藻计划。另计划铺一条电车道把牲畜市场（北环路和普鲁士街）和码头（下谢里夫街和东堤坝）连接起来[275]。这条电车道和（作为大南部与大西部铁道线的延长）将从利菲联轨点的牲畜牧地铺设到北堤坝四十三至四十五号大西部中区铁路终点站与连接线是平行的。附近有大中央铁路、英国中部铁路、都柏林市班轮公司、兰开夏[276]- 约克郡铁道公司、都柏林-格拉斯哥班轮船公司、格拉斯哥-都柏林- 敦德里[277]班轮公司（莱尔德航线）、英国-爱尔兰班轮公司、都柏林-莫克姆轮船[278]、伦敦-西北铁道公司等的终点站或都柏林分店；都柏林港码头管理处卸货棚，帕尔格雷夫-墨菲公司的船主们和来自地中海、西班牙、葡萄牙、法国、比利时和荷兰的轮船公司那些代理人的临时堆栈，还有利物浦海上保险协会的临时堆栈。运输牲畜所需全部车辆[279]以及额外里程由都柏林市联合电车（股份有限）公司经营管理，费用由畜牧业者负担。 \n \n 假定一个什么样的条件从句，这几种计划的缩约辞，就会成为自然而必然的结论句？ \n \n 靠那几位在成功的生涯中积累了六个位数的巨富的著名金融家（布鲁姆·帕夏[280]、罗思柴尔德[281]、古根海姆、希尔施、蒙特斐奥雷[282]、摩根、洛克菲勒）的赞助。捐款者在世的话，就凭着赠与契约或转让证书，无疾而终后则凭着遗嘱来馈赠。可以保证拿到与所需款项同额的钱，抓住机会，善用资本则事必有所成。 \n \n 什么样的偶然事件能使他不必去指靠这样的财富呢？ \n \n 独自发现一座取之不尽用之不竭的金矿脉。 \n \n 他何以要去构思一项实现起来如此之困难的计划呢？ \n \n 他所持的原则之一是：如果在就寝前经常反复思考类似的事，或自动地对自己谈谈关于自己的问题，抑或安详地回忆一下过去，这样就能减轻疲劳，睡得香，并使精力倍增。 \n \n 论据何在？ \n \n 作为一个物理学家，他得以知道一个人七十年的整个生涯，至少有七分之二，也就是二十年，是在睡眠中度过的。作为一个哲学家，他晓得不论何人，在大限临头的时候，自己的欲望只实现了极其微小的一部分。作为一个生理学家，他相信，主要在睡眠状态中活跃着的各种邪恶的念头是能够人为地平息下去的。 \n \n 他害怕什么？ \n \n 因位于大脑沟回中的不能按同一标准衡量的绝对理智——理性之光产生错乱，在睡眠中犯下杀人或自杀的行为。 \n \n 他惯常最后冥想的是什么？ \n \n 独一无二、无与伦比的广告，会使行人惊异地停下脚步。一张新颖的招贴，排除了一切不必要的附加物，简约到最单纯最富于效果的词句，一目了然，适合于现代生活的速度。 \n \n 开锁之后，头一个抽屉里装着什么？ \n \n 维尔·福斯特[ 283]的习字帖一册，系米莉（米莉森特）的所有物，其中几页上画着题为“爹爹”的图形。画面上是一颗球状大脑袋，竖着五根头发，侧脸上有一双眼睛。胴体则朝着正面，有三颗大纽扣，长着一只三角形的脚。两张褪色的照片：英国的亚历山德拉王后[ 284]和莫德·布兰斯科姆[285] ，女演员和职业性美人。一张圣诞节贺片[ 286]，上面是一棵寄生植物[287]的图，米斯巴的传说[288]

玛莎·克利弗德（查明玛·克是堆）寄给亨利·弗罗尔（亨·弗即指利·布）的第四封打字信。 \n \n 伴随着这一动作，有何愉快的回忆？ \n \n 他回忆着，姑且不去说所提到的这封信本身，他那充满魅力的容貌、风采和谈吐，在过去的一天内曾赢得一位有夫之妇（约瑟芬·布林太太，原名乔西·鲍威尔）[305]、一位护士——卡伦[306]小姐（教名不详）和一个少女——格楚德（格蒂，姓氏不明）的青睐。 \n \n 什么样的可能性浮现到他的头脑里了？ \n \n 最近的将来在一位体面的高等妓女（富于肉体美、对金钱较淡薄、有着种种教养、原是出身名门的淑女）的内室里共进一顿丰盛的饭菜，然后发挥男性魅力的可能性。 \n \n 第二个抽屉里装着什么？ \n \n 文件：利奥波德·保拉[307] ·布卢姆的出生证。苏格兰遗孀基金人寿保险公司[308] 的养老保险单一纸，受保险人米莉森特（米莉）·布卢姆年满二十五岁时生效；根据受益证书，年届六十或死亡，付四百三十英镑；年届六十五或死亡，付四百六十二英镑十先令；更年长时死亡，则付五百英镑。也可根据选择，接受二百九十九英镑十先令的受益证书（款额付讫）以及一百三十三英镑十先令的现金。厄尔斯特银行学院草地分行[309] 的储蓄存折一本，记载着一九0三年十二月三十一日截止的下半期结算存款余额，即帐户的现金余额为十八英镑十四先令六便士，个人动产全额。持有加拿大政府所发行年利率四分（记名）的九百英镑国库债券（豁免印花税）的证书。天主教墓地（葛拉斯涅文）委员会的购买茔地的收据。刊登在地方报纸上的启事的剪报，系有关变更姓氏的单方盖章生效的证书。 \n \n 引用一下这份启事。 \n \n 我，鲁道尔夫·维拉格，现住都柏林克兰布拉西尔街五十二号，原籍匈牙利王国松博特海伊市。兹刊登改姓启事，今后在任何场合，任何时候，均使用鲁道尔夫·布卢姆这一姓名。 \n \n 第二个抽屉里还有些什么与鲁道尔夫·布卢姆（原姓维拉格）有关的东西？ \n \n 鲁道尔夫·维拉格与他父亲利奥波德·维拉格的一帧模糊的合影，是一八五二年于匈牙利塞斯白堡在斯蒂芬·维拉格（分别为他们的第一代嫡堂兄弟和第二代隔房堂兄弟[310] 的银板照相室里拍摄的。）一部古老的《哈加达》书[311] ，逾越节的礼拜祭文中感谢经那一页夹着一副玳瑁架老花眼镜。一张照片明信片，画面上是鲁道尔夫·布卢姆所开的恩尼斯镇皇后饭店[312] 。一个信封，收信人是：我亲爱的儿子利奥波德[313] 启。 \n \n 拜读了这五个完整的单词，唤起他对哪些片言只语的回忆？ \n \n 自从我收到……明天就是一个星期了……利奥波德，那是徒劳无益的……跟你亲爱的母亲……再也忍受不下去了……到她那里去……对我来说，一切都完啦……利奥波德，要爱护阿索斯[314] ……我亲爱的儿子……永远……关于我……心……天主……你的[ 315] …… \n \n 关于身患进行性忧郁症的一个人的主体，这些客体在布卢姆心里唤起了什么样的回忆？ \n \n 一个老鳏夫，头发蓬乱，戴着睡帽，躺在床上唉声叹气；一只病狗，阿索斯；作为发作性神经痛的镇痛剂，逐渐加量服用的附子；一位七十岁上服毒自杀者的遗容。 \n \n 布卢姆何以经受了一番悔恨之情？ \n \n 因为他出于幼稚的焦躁，曾轻蔑地对待某些教义和教规。 \n \n 例如？ \n \n 跟原来笃信同一宗教、又属于同一国度的那些极端抽象而又无比具体、重商主义的人们举行周会[316] 后，禁止在会餐的席间同时食用兽肉和奶；为男婴行割礼；犹太经典的超自然特性；应当避讳的四个神圣的字母[317] ；安息日的神圣。 \n \n 如今他怎样看待这些教义和教规呢？ \n \n 虽并不比当年他觉得的更为合理，却也不比他心目中的其他教义和教规更为不合理。 \n \n 他对鲁道尔夫·布卢姆（已故）的最早的回忆是什么？ \n \n 鲁道尔夫·布卢姆（已故）在对其子利奥波德·布卢姆（时年六岁）回顾着自己过去怎样为了依次在都柏林、伦敦、佛罗伦萨、米兰、维也纳、布达佩斯、松博特海伊之间搬迁并定居所做的种种安排；还做了些踌躇满志的陈述（他的祖父拜见过奥地利女皇、匈牙利女王玛丽亚·特蕾莎）并插进一些生意经（只要懂得爱惜便士，英镑自会源源而来）。利奥波德·布卢姆（时年六岁）一边听着这些故事，一边不断地参看欧洲（政治）地图，并建议在上述各个中心城市设立营业所。 \n \n 岁月是否同样地、却又以不同的方式抹去了讲者与听者对这些迁移的记忆？ \n \n 讲者是因岁数增长以及服用麻醉剂的结果。听者则因岁数增长以及设想着身临其境的感受用以自娱的结果。 \n \n 随着讲者的健忘症，产生了什么样的特殊反应？ \n \n 他有时不摘帽子就吃起饭来。他有时翘起盘子贪婪地吮着醋栗果酱的汁液。他有时随手用撕开的信封或身边其他纸片来揩拭沾在嘴唇上的食物痕迹。 \n \n 更频频出现的两种衰老的迹象是什么？ \n \n 凭着一双近视眼用手指数硬币。因吃得过饱而打嗝。 \n \n 什么东西对这些回忆多少给与了慰藉？ \n \n 养老保险单，银行存折，股票的临时单据。 \n \n 把布卢姆凭借这些证券所避免受到的厄运相乘，并除去一切正数值，将他换算成可忽略的量、负量、无理性的量和虚量。 \n \n 依次下降到奴隶阶级的最底层。贫困方面：做沿街叫卖的人造宝石小贩，讨倒账、荒帐的，济贫税、地方税代理收税员。行乞方面：欺诈成性的破产者，对每一英磅的欠款只有一先令四便士的微乎其微的偿还能力者，广告人，撒传单的，夜间的流浪汉，巴结求宠的谄媚者，缺胳膊短腿的水手，双目失明的青年，为法警跑腿的老朽[318]，宴会乞丐，舔盘子的，专扫人兴的，马屁精，撑着一把捡来的、净是窟窿的伞，坐在公园的长凳上，成为公众笑料的怪人。潦倒方面：位于基尔曼哈姆[319] 的养老院（皇家医院）的住院患者。住在辛普森医院的病人：因患痛风症及失明永远丧失生活能力的落魄而有身份者。悲惨的最下层：老迈、无能、丧失了公民权、靠救济金维持生活[320] 、奄奄一息、精神错乱的贫民。 \n \n 伴随而来的是怎样的屈辱？ \n \n 原先和蔼可亲的女人们，如今既不同情又冷淡；壮健的男人抱以轻蔑态度；接受面包碎屑，偶然结识的熟人们佯装素昧平生；来历不明、没有挂牌子的野狗狂叫着；顽童们把价值很小或毫无价值，毫无价值或根本谈不到价值的烂白菜当作飞弹来进攻。 \n \n 怎样才能杜绝这样的境遇？ \n \n 借着死亡（状况的变化）；借着别离（地点的变化）。 \n \n 哪一种更可取？ \n \n 后者，因为最省力气。 \n \n 何种考虑使离别未必不合乎心意？ \n \n 经常的同居生活正妨碍着对个人缺点的相互宽容。日益助长的自作主张地购买东西的习惯。借短期的旅居来消解一下永久之束缚的必要性。 \n \n 出于哪些考虑，离别不会令人觉得不合情理？ \n \n 这对男女结合后，增加并繁殖[321] ，从而生养了后代，并已长大成人。双方如果不分离，势必为了增加并繁殖而重新结合，这是荒谬的，借着重新结合来形成原先结合的那一对配偶，那是不可能的。 \n \n 出于何种考虑使离别合乎心意？ \n \n 爱尔兰和外国一些地区那引人入胜的特色，如见之于通常那种彩色地图或使用缩尺数字和蓑状线的特殊的陆军军用地图测绘图表。 \n \n 在爱尔兰呢？ \n \n 莫霍尔的断崖[322] ，康尼马拉那多风的荒野[ 323] ，淹没了一座化石城市的拉夫·尼格湖[324] ，巨人堤道[325]，卡姆登要塞和卡莱尔要塞[326] ，蒂珀雷里的黄金峡谷[327] ，阿伦群岛[ 328] ，王家米斯郡[329] ，布里奇特那棵基尔代尔的榆树[330] ，贝尔法斯特的皇后岛造船厂[331]，蛙鱼飞跃[332] 和基拉尼的湖区[ 333] 。 \n \n 海外呢？ \n \n 锡兰（有着香料园，向伦敦市内东区明欣巷二号的帕尔布卢克- 罗伯逊公司的代理店、都柏林市戴姆街五号的托马斯·克南供应红茶），圣城耶路撒冷（有着莪默清真寺和大马士革门——众心所向往的目的地）[334] ，直布罗陀海峡（玛莉恩·特威迪的无与伦比的出生地），帕台农神庙[335] （供奉着希腊神明的裸体塑像），华尔街金融市场（支配着世界金融），西班牙拉利内阿的托罗斯广场（卡梅隆的约翰·奥哈拉在这里打死过一头公牛）[336]，尼亚加拉瀑布（没有人曾安然无恙地跨过它）[337] ，爱斯基摩人（食肥皂者）的土地，被禁之国西藏（从来没有一个旅人回来过）[ 338] ，那布勒斯海湾（去看它就等于去送命）[339]，死海。 \n \n 在什么的引导下，跟随着什么标志？ \n \n 海上，朝着北方，夜间以北极星为标志。将大熊星座的“贝塔——阿尔法”这一直线延长至星座外的“奥墨伽”，北极星便位于“阿尔法——奥墨伽”这道外部区分线与大熊星座内的“阿尔法——德尔塔”这一直线所形成的直角三角形斜边的交点上[340]。陆地上，朝着南方，以双球体的月亮为标志：一个正徜徉着的丰腴、邋遢女人那没有完全遮住的裙子后面，从裂缝里露出太阴月那不完整、起着变化的月相。白天，用云柱指示方向[341]。 \n \n 用什么样的广告把离去者失踪一事公诸于世？ \n \n 寻人启事，奖赏五英镑。姓名利奥波德（波尔迪）·布卢姆、年约四十的绅士，从埃克尔斯街七号的自己家中失踪、被拐骗或走失。身高五英尺九英寸半，体态丰满，橄榄色皮肤，后来有可能蓄起胡子。最后一次被人看到时，身穿黑服。凡提供有助于发现他的线索者，酬金照付不误。 \n \n 作为存在者和不存在者，他会有个什么样的普遍使用的双名， \n \n 人人通用或无人知晓。“普通人”或是“无人”[342]。 \n \n 给他献了哪些贡品？ \n \n “普通人”的朋友们，素昧平生的人们所给予的荣誉和礼物。永生的宁芙，一个美女，“无人”的新娘子[343] 。 \n \n 在任何地方，任何情况下，这位离去者[344] 也永远不会重新出现了吗？ \n \n 他会迫使自己朝着他的替星轨道之极限永远流浪，越过诸恒星、一颗颗变光的星和只有用望远镜才能看到的诸行星以及那些天文学上的漂泊者和迷路者从众多民族当中穿过，经历各种事件，从一个国家走到另一个国家，奔向空间尽头的边界。不知在什么地方，他依稀听见了召唤他回去的声音。于是，就有点儿不大情愿地、在恒星的强制下服从了。这样，他从北冕星座那儿消失了踪影，不知怎么一来，他再生了，并重新出现在仙后星座的“德尔塔”[345]上空。在无限世纪的漫游之后，成为一个从异邦返回的复仇者，秉公惩戒歹徒者，怀着阴暗心情的十字军战士[346] ，甦醒了的沉睡者[347] ，其拥有的财富超过罗斯柴尔德[348]或白银国王[349] （假定如此）。 \n \n 是什么使这样的返回成为不合情理？ \n \n 在可逆转的空间内，时间方面的出发与返回以及在不可逆转的时间内，空间方面的出发与返回，二者之间有着不能令人满意的误差。 \n \n 由于什么力量起作用而产生了惰性，使离别并不合乎心意？ \n \n 时间迟晏，使人犹豫拖延；夜间太黑，遮住视线；大街上不安定，充满危险；休息的需要，阻碍了行动；睡着人的床就近在咫尺，用不着去寻觅；对那被（衬衣被单）的冰凉缓解了的（人的）温暖的期待，排除了某种欲望，又挑起另一种欲望；纳希素斯的雕像，没有“回音”的音响[350] ，渴求的欲望。 \n \n 跟没人睡着的床比起来，有人睡着的床显然有哪些优点？ \n \n 消除了夜晚的孤寂，人（成熟的女性）的温暖胜过非人（“汤壶”）的热气以及早晨的接触给予的刺激；把长裤叠齐，竖着夹在弹簧床垫（带条纹的）和羊毛垫子（黄褐色方格花纹）之间，就能节省熨烫之劳了。 \n \n 布卢姆起身之前便预感到了积劳，而他在起身之前又怎样默默地概括了过去那一连串的原因呢？ \n \n 准备早餐（燔祭）[351] ，肠内装满以及预先想到的排便（至圣所）[352] ，洗澡（约翰的仪式）[353] ，葬礼（撒姆耳的仪式）[ 354] ，亚历山大·凯斯的广告（火与真理）[355] ，不丰盛的午餐（麦基洗德）[ 356] ，访问博物馆和国立图书馆（神圣的地方）[357] ，沿着贝德福德路、商贾拱廊[358] ，韦林顿码头搜购书籍（喜哉法典）[359] ，奥蒙德饭店里的音乐（歌中之歌[360] ）。在伯纳德·卡南的酒吧里与横蛮无理的穴居人[361] 吵嘴（燔祭）。包括一段空白时间：乘马车到办丧事的家[362]去以及一次诀别（旷野）[363] 。女人的裸露癖所引起的性冲动（俄南[364] ）。米娜·普里福伊那时间拖得很长的分娩（奉献祭物的礼拜式[365] ）。造访下蒂龙街八十三号贝拉·科恩太太开的妓院，随后在比弗街争吵起来，又有一场偶然发生的混战（大决战[366] ）。夜间漫步到巴特桥的马车夫棚，又走了回来（赎罪）[ 367] 。 \n \n 由于怕总也下不了决心，为了让事情有个结局而刚要站起来走去的时候，布卢姆对自己出的什么隐谜不由自主地恍然大悟？ \n \n 纹理歪斜的桌子那毫无感觉的木材会突然发出短促而尖锐、只能听到而看不到、高亢而寂寥的喀嚓声的来由[368] 。 \n \n 布卢姆站起来，抱着五颜六色、各种各样、为数众多的衣服正要走的时候，对自告奋勇去破的什么隐谜自发地有所领悟，然而却又未能理解？ \n \n 那个穿胶布雨衣的人[369] 是谁？ \n \n 此刻，熄灭了人工的照明并实现了自然的黑暗，布卢姆怎样默默地忽然悟出那个三十年来偶尔漫不经心地思索过的不言而喻的隐谜呢？ \n \n 烛火熄灭时摩西在哪里[370] ？ \n \n 布卢姆一边走着[371] ，一边默默地一桩桩历数在完整的一天当中未能完成的哪些事情？ \n \n 一时的失败：没能拿到续订广告的契约，没能从托马斯·克南食品店（伦敦市东中区明欣巷二号帕尔布卢克- 鲁宾逊公司驻都柏林市戴姆街五号的代理店）里买些茶叶，没能搞清楚希腊女神后身有无直肠口，没能弄到一张班德曼·帕默夫人在欢乐剧场（国王南街四十六、四十七、四十八、四十九号）公演《丽亚》[372]的门票（赠送或购买）。 \n \n 布卢姆停下脚步，默地追忆起一位故人怎样的印象？ \n \n 她父亲——已故布赖恩·库珀·特威迪鼓手长的面影，他属于驻直布罗陀的都柏林近卫步兵连队，住在海豚仓的雷霍博特路。 \n \n 有可能假定这一面影的什么样的印象反复地忽隐忽现？ \n \n 从大北铁路阿缅街终点站，不停地以标准加速度正沿着那如果延长、会在无限彼方相遇的平行线逐渐离去。沿着那重新出现在无限彼方的平行线，不断地以标准减速度，正朝着大北铁路阿缅街终点站折回来。 \n \n 女子贴身穿的哪些各种各样的衣物映入了他的眼帘？ \n \n 一双崭新、没有气味、半丝质的黑色女长筒袜，一副紫罗兰色新袜带，一条印度细软薄棉布做的大号女衬裤，剪裁宽松，散发着苦树脂、素馨香水和穆拉蒂牌土耳其香烟的气味，还别着一根锃亮的钢质长别针，折叠成曲线状。一件镶着薄花边的短袖麻纱衬衣，一条蓝纹绸百褶衬裙。这些衣物都胡乱放在一只长方形箱盖上：四边用板条钉牢，四角是双层的，贴着五颜六色的标签，正面用白字写有首字B. C. T（布赖恩·库珀·特威迪）。 \n \n 看见了哪些贴身衣物之外的东西？ \n \n 断了一条腿的五斗柜，整个儿用剪裁成四角形的苹果花纹印花装饰布蒙起来，上面摆着一顶黑色女用草帽。一批布满回纹的陶器，是从穆尔街二十一、二十二、二十三号的亨利·普赖斯那儿买来的，他是制造篮子、花哨的小工艺品、瓷器、五金制品的厂商。这些陶器包括脸盆、肥皂钵和刷子缸（一道放在洗脸架上）带柄的大水罐和尿盆（分别撂在地板上）。 \n \n 布卢姆如何行动？ \n \n 他把几件衣服放在椅子上，脱掉剩下的几样。从床头的长枕下面抽出折叠好的白色长睡衣，将头和双臂套入睡衣的适当部位，把一只枕头从床头移到床脚，床单也相应地整理了一番。然后就上了。床。 \n \n 怎么个上法？ \n \n 谨慎地，就像每一次进入一座房子（他自己的或并非他自己的）的时候那样，小心翼翼地，因为床垫子那蛇状螺旋弹簧已经陈旧了，黄铜环和蝰蛇状拱形挡头也松松垮垮的，一用力过头就颤悠；顾虑周到地，就好像进入肉欲或毒蛇的巢穴或隐身之处似的；轻轻地，省得惊动她；虔诚地，因为那是妊娠与分娩之床，合卺与失贞之床，睡眠与死亡之床。 \n \n 他的四肢逐渐伸开的时候，碰到了什么？ \n \n 簇新而干净的床单，新添的好几种气味。一个人体的存在：女性的，她的；一个人体留下的痕迹，男性的，不是他的。一些面包碎屑，薄薄的几片回过锅的罐头肉，他给掸掉了。 \n \n 倘若他微笑了，他为什么会微笑呢？ \n \n 他仔细一想，每一个进入者都认为自己是头一个进去的，其实，他总是一连串先行者的后继者，即便他是一连串后继者的第一个。每个人都自以为是头一个，最后一个，唯一的和独一无二的，其实在那源于无限，又无限地重复下去的一连串当中，他既不是头一个，也不是最后一个，既不是唯一的，也不是独一无二的。 \n \n 先行者都有哪一些？ \n \n 假定马尔维[373]是那一连串当中的头一个，接着是彭罗斯、巴特尔·达西[374] 、古德温教授[375] 、马斯添斯基[376] 、约翰、亨利·门顿[377]、伯纳德·科里根神父[378] 、皇家都柏林协会马匹展示会上的那位农场主[379］、马戈特·奥里利［380]、马修·狄龙[381] 、瓦伦丁·布莱克·狄龙[ 382]（都柏林市市长）、克里斯托弗·卡里南[383] 、利内翰[384] 、某意大利轮擦提琴手[ 385] 、欢乐剧场里的那位素昧平生的绅士[386] 、本杰明·多拉德[ 387]、西蒙·迪达勒斯、安德鲁（精明鬼）·伯克[388] 、约瑟夫·卡夫[389]、威兹德姆·希利[390] 、市政委员约翰·胡珀[391] 、弗朗西斯·布雷迪大夫[392]、阿古斯山的塞巴斯蒂安神父[393] 、邮政总局的某擦鞋匠[ 394] 、休·E.（布莱泽斯）·博伊兰以及其他等等，直到无限[395] 。 \n \n 关于这一连串中的最后一名，新近占有此床者，他有何想法？ \n \n 他想到那个人精力旺盛（莽汉），身材匀称（贴广告的），生财有道（骗子），印象强烈（牛皮大王）。 \n \n 除了精力旺盛，身材匀称，生财有道之外，那个人何以还给观察者强烈印象呢？ \n \n 因为他曾愈益频繁地目击到，上述那一连串先行者曾沉浸于同一淫荡之情，将越来越旺的欲火延烧过去，先伴随着不安，继而有了默契，春心大动，最后带来了疲劳，交替显示出相互理解与惊恐的征兆。 \n \n 随后他的思绪被哪些互不相容的感情所左右？ \n \n 羡慕，妬忌，克制，沉着。 \n \n 何以羡慕？ \n \n 那肉体的、精神的男性器官特别适合于在精力充沛地交媾时自上而下、精力充沛地进行活塞在气缸中的那种往复运动。而为了使那肉体的、精神的（被动而并不迟钝的）女性器官所具备的持久而不剧烈的情欲充分得到满足，这是不可或缺的。 \n \n 何以妒忌？ \n \n 因为丰满的肉体摆脱了束缚，就会发挥出快活的特性，交替地起着吸引或被吸引的作用。因为起作用者和被起作用者之间的吸引力无时无刻不在发生着变化，而这又与持续不断的环状扩张和放射再突入的增减形成反比例。由于对吸引力增减的有节制的冥想，也能够调节快感的消长。 \n \n 何以克制？ \n \n 鉴于那是：（甲）一九0 三年九月在伊登码头五号的兼营服饰用品业的裁缝乔治·梅西雅斯[396] 的店里结识以来的熟人；（乙）当事人献了殷勤，接受下来了，并报以同样的殷勤，对方也亲自接受了；（丙）年纪较轻，容易野心勃勃或宽宏大量，同行间的利他行为或出于爱恋的利己之举。（丁）不同种族之间的吸引，同一种族之间的相互抑制，超种族的特权；（戊）即将到外省去举行一次巡回音乐会。挑费平摊，纯收益平分。 \n \n 何以镇定？ \n \n 因为这跟相异又相似的自然生物，按照雄性、雌性或两性的天赋本性，并顺应天赋本性，主动地或被动地贯彻执行自然界任何及所有那些自然行为一样地自然。这一灾难还不像行星与隐蔽的恒星相撞时所发生的毁灭性剧变那样大。比起盗窃、拦路抢劫，虐待儿童与动物，诈骗金钱，制造伪币，侵吞挪用公款，背叛公众的信任，装病旷工，故意伤害致残，腐蚀未成年人，恶毒诽谤，敲诈，藐视法庭，纵火，叛逆，罪上加罪，侵害公海，非法侵入，夜盗，越狱，鸡奷，临阵脱逃，做伪证，偷猎，放高利贷，间谍行为，冒充，殴打，故意杀人与谋杀，罪责并没那么严重。它并不比使人体组织和随之而来的情况（食物、饮料、后天的习惯、嗜好上了瘾，重病）保持平衡，为了适应各种生活条件的变化而改变的其他一切过程更为不正常。这不仅是不可避免的，甚至是无法补救的。 \n \n 何以节制多于妒忌，羡慕少于沉着？ \n \n 从暴行（婚姻）到暴行（通奸），除了暴行（交媾），什么也没发生；然而婚姻受到凌辱的那位凭着婚姻施暴行者并没有遭到那个施通奸这一暴行者凭着通奸进行凌辱者的暴行。 \n \n 如果可能的话，怎样复仇？ \n \n 暗杀是绝对不可行的，因为以恶报恶是得不出善的。持武器来决斗，要不得。离婚嘛，现在时机未到。用机械装置（自动床）[397]，或个人的证言（隐伏的目击者）予以暴露，那还不到时候。靠法律的力量控诉，要求赔偿损害，也就是说，自称被袭击甚至受到伤害（自伤），从而做伪证，这都并非不可能[398] 。倘若可能，断然予以默许，并准备与之抗争（物质上，对手是兴隆的广告代理商；精神上，对手是成功的私通代理商），轻视，疏远，屈辱以至分居（一方面保护仳离者，同时又从双方手下保护那个仳离仲裁者）。 \n \n 他这个对茫茫空虚性有意识地做出反应者，是借着哪些思考才对自己证明这些情感是正当的呢？ \n \n 处女膜先天的脆弱性，物体本身预先假定的不可触性。为了达到目的而自我延长的那份紧张以及完成之后的自我缩短与松弛，这二者之间既不调和也不均衡。女性之虚弱及男性之强韧乃基于谬误的臆测。道德的准则是可变的。自然的语法转换：在不引起意思变动的情况下，由主动语态不定过去式命题（从语法上分析：男性主语，单音节拟声及物动词，女性直接宾语）转位到相关的被动语态不定过去式命题：3”）（从语法上分析：女性主语，助动词与准单音节拟声过去分词，男性主动补语）。借着生殖，不断地生产播种者们。借着酿造来连续地生产精液。胜利也罢，抗议也罢，复仇也罢，都是徒劳的。对贞操的颂扬煞是无聊。无知觉的物质毫无生气。星辰之情感淡漠[400]。 \n \n 还原为最简单形式的这些互不相容的感情和思考，收敛成怎样一种最后的满足呢？ \n \n 地球的东西两半球所有已勘探或未勘探过的那些适于居住的陆地及岛屿（午夜的太阳之国[401] 、幸福岛[402] 、希腊的各个岛屿[403]、被应许的土地[404]上，到处都是脂肪质女性臀部后半球；散发出奶与蜜以及分泌性血液与精液的温暖香气，令人联想到古老血统的丰满曲线，既不喜怒无常，也不故意闹别扭，显示出沉默而永远不变的成熟的动物性。这一切所激起的满足感。 \n \n 满足之前有何显著特征？ \n \n 即将勃起，渴望的注目，逐渐地挺立，试探性的露出，无言的静观。 \n \n 然后呢？ \n \n 他吻着她臀部那一对丰满熟软、淡黄馨香的瓜，与丰腴的瓜那 \n \n 两个半球，以及那烂熟淡黄的垄沟，接了个微妙、富于挑逗性而散 \n \n 发着瓜香的长长的吻。 \n \n 满足之后有何显著迹象， \n \n 无言的沉思，暂时的隐蔽，逐渐地自贬，焦心的嫌恶，即将勃 \n \n 起。 \n \n 这一沉默的动作之后呢？ \n \n 在嗜眠中呼吁，恍恍惚惚地认出，初期的兴奋，教义问答式的 \n \n 详细讯问。 \n \n 回答讯问时，讲者做了哪些修饰？ \n \n 消极方面，他故意不提玛莎·克利弗德与亨利·弗罗尔之间秘 \n \n 密通信事；在位于小不列颠街八、九、十号、特准卖酒的伯纳德·基尔南股份有限公司内部和附近当众吵嘴的事，以及由于格楚德（格蒂，姓氏不详）裸露下体，进行色情的挑逗所引起的反应。积极方面，他谈到班德曼·帕默夫人在位于南国王街四十六、四十七、四十八、四十九号的欢乐剧场扮演丽亚这一角色[405]事；接到将在下阿贝街三十五、三十六和三十七号的怀恩（墨菲）饭店举行的晚餐会请帖；由一位匿名的时下名流所作的一本题名《偷情的快乐》、具有淫秽色情倾向的书；宴会后表演体操，因某个动作失误而造成暂时的脑震荡，受伤者（现已痊愈）为教师兼作家斯蒂芬·迪达勒斯，他乃无固定职业的西蒙·迪达勒斯仍健在的长子；当着一位目击者，即该教师兼作家的面，他（讲者）以机敏果断和体操的弹性表演了空中特技。 \n \n 讲述没有另外用修饰加工改动吗？ \n \n 绝对没有。 \n \n 哪一件事或哪一个人在他谈话中最是突出？ \n \n 教师兼作家斯蒂芬·迪达勒斯。 \n \n 在时断时续、愈益简短的讲述中，听者与讲者察觉了他们二人在行使或抑制结婚的权利方面，受到了哪些限制， \n \n 就听者而言，在生育上受到了限制。因为结婚仪式是她过了十八岁生日（一八七0 年九月八日）一个月之后，即十月八日举行的，当天同衾；其实同年九月十日二人己提前发生完全的肉体关系，包括往女性天然器官内射精[406] ；一八八九年六月十五日生下一女。最后一次同房是一八九三年十一月二十六日，那是第二胎（唯一的子嗣）于一八九三年十二月二十九日出生的五周前，而此婴生后十一天即夭折。以后的十年五个月十八天期间，一直未发生完全的肉体关系，再也未往女性天然的器官内射精。就讲者而言，身心两方面的活动力均受到了限制。因为自从一九①三年九月十五日讲者与听者之间所生女儿初次来了月经，标志着青春期的到来，夫妻之间即未再有精神上的完全的交往。从此，两个成熟的女子（听者与女儿）之间，在本人并不理解的情况下，先天地自然地建立了相互理解。其结果，九个月零一天的时间里，在讲者与听者之间的完全的肉体行动自由受到了限制。 \n \n 受到怎样的限制？ \n \n 当男方计划或将短期离家时，女方便反复盘问前往何处、所去场所、所需时间和外出目的等等。 \n \n 在听者与讲者看不见的思维上方，有什么看得见的东西正在移动？ \n \n 带罩子的灯投到顶棚上的反影，重重叠叠的光和影构成一个个浓淡不等的同心圆。 \n \n 听者与讲者朝哪个方向躺着？ \n \n 听者朝东南偏东方，讲者朝西北偏西方；地点为北纬五十三度，西经六度；在地球上与赤道形成四十五度角。 \n \n 处在何等静止或活动状态？ \n \n 就二人本身及相互的关系而言，是处于静止状态。由于永远不变的空间不断起着变化的轨道上那地球固有的不断的运动，一个人朝前方，一个人朝后方，双方都处于被送往西方的运动状态。 \n \n 姿势如何？ \n \n 听者：半朝左横卧着，左手托头，右腿伸直，架在蟋起来的左腿上，那姿势活像是该亚- 忒耳斯[407] ，饱满而慵懒，大腹便便，孕育着种子。讲者：朝左横卧着，双腿蜷曲，右手的食指与拇指按着鼻梁，恰似珀西·阿普约翰所抓拍的一张快照上那个疲倦的娃娃人——子宫内的娃娃人的姿势。 \n \n 子宫内？疲倦吗？ \n \n 他正在休息。他曾经旅行过。 \n \n 跟谁？ \n \n 水手辛伯达[408] 、裁缝廷伯达[409] 、狱卒金伯达、捕鲸者浑伯达、制钉工人宁伯达、失败者芬伯达、掏船肚水者宾伯达[410]、桶匠频伯达[411] 、邮寄者明伯达、欢呼者欣伯达、咒骂者林伯达、菜食主义者丁伯达[412] 、畏惧者温伯达[413] 、赛马赌徒凌伯达、水手兴伯达。 \n \n 什么时候？ \n \n 到黑暗的床上去的时候，有一颗水手辛伯达那神鹰[ 414] 的方圆形海雀[415] 蛋。那是亮昼男暗伯达所有那些神鹰的海雀们的夜晚之床。 \n \n 在哪里？ \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/63/3719.html","bookId":583,"book":{"id":583,"title":"Ulysses尤利西斯","description":"简介：
