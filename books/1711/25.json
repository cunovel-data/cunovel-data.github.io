{"id":66889,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Tim watched until he was sure the velociraptor was coming toward the kitchen. Was it following their scent? All the books said dinosaurs had a poor sense of smell, but this one seemed to do just fine. Anyway, what did books know? Here was the real thing.\n Coming toward him.\n He ducked back into the kitchen.\n \"Is something out there?\" Lex said.\n Tim didn\u0027t answer. He pushed her under a table in the corner, behind a large waste bin. He leaned close to her and whispered fiercely: \"Stay here!\" And then he ran for the refrigerator.\n He grabbed a handful of cold steaks and hurried back to the door. He quietly placed the first of the steaks on the floor, then moved back a few steps, and put down the second. . . .\n Through his goggles, he saw Lex peeping around the bin. He waved her back. He placed the third steak, and the fourth, moving deeper into the kitchen.\n The hissing was louder, and then the clawed hand gripped the door, and the big head peered cautiously around.\n The velociraptor paused at the entrance to the kitchen.\n Tim stood in a half-crouch at the back of the room, near the far leg of the steel worktable. But he had not had time to conceal himself; his head and shoulders still protruded over the tabletop. He was in clear view of the velociraptor.\n Slowly, Tim lowered his body, sinking beneath the table. . . . The velociraptor jerked its head around, looking directly at Tim.\n Tim froze. He was still exposed, but he thought, Don\u0027t move.\n The velociraptor stood motionless in the doorway.\n Sniffing.\n It\u0027s darker here, Tim thought. He can\u0027t see so well. It\u0027s making him cautious.\n But now he could smell the musty odor of the big reptile, and through his goggles he saw the dinosaur silently yawn, throwing back its long snout, exposing rows of razor-sharp teeth. The velociraptor stared forward again, jerking its head from side to side. The big eyes swiveled in the bony sockets.\n Tim felt his heart pounding. Somehow it was worse to be confronted by an animal like this in a kitchen, instead of the open forest. The size, the quick movements, the pungent odor, the hissing breath . . .\n Up close, it was a much more frightening animal than the tyrannosaur. The Tyrannosaur was huge and powerful, but it wasn\u0027t especially smart. The velociraptor was man-size, and it was clearly quick and intelligent; Tim feared the searching eyes almost as much as the sharp teeth.\n The velociraptor sniffed. It stepped forward-moving directly toward Lex! It must smell her, somehow! Tim\u0027s heart thumped.\n The velociraptor stopped. It bent over slowly.\n He\u0027s found the steak.\n Tim wanted to bend down, to look below the table, but he didn\u0027t dare move. He stood frozen in a half-crouch, listening to the crunching sound. The dinosaur was eating it. Bones and all.\n The raptor raised its slender head, and looked around. It sniffed. It saw the second steak. It moved quickly forward. It bent down.\n Silence.\n The raptor didn\u0027t eat it.\n The head came back up. Tim\u0027s legs burned from the crouch, but he didn\u0027t move.\n Why hadn\u0027t the animal eaten the second steak? A dozen ideas flashed through his mind-it didn\u0027t like the taste of beef, it didn\u0027t like the coldness, it didn\u0027t like the fact that the meat wasn\u0027t alive, it smelled a trap, it smelled Lex, it smelled Tim, it saw Tim-\n The velociraptor moved very quickly now. It found the third steak, dipped its head, looked up again, and moved on.\n Tim held his breath. The dinosaur was now just a few feet from him, Tim could see the small twitches in the muscles of the flanks. He could see the crusted blood on the claws of the hand. He could see the fine pattern of striations within the spotted pattern, and the folds of skin in the neck below the jaw.\n The velociraptor sniffed. It jerked its head, and looked right at Tim. Tim nearly gasped with fright. Tim\u0027s body was rigid, tense. He watched as the reptile eye moved, scanning the room. Another sniff.\n He\u0027s got me, Tim thought.\n Then the head jerked back to look forward, and the animal went on, toward the fifth steak. Tim thought, Lex please don\u0027t move please don\u0027t move whatever you do please don\u0027t . . .\n The velociraptor sniffed the steak, and moved on. It was now at the open door to the freezer. Tim could see the smoke billowing out, curling along the floor toward the animal\u0027s feet. One big clawed foot lifted, then came down again, silently. The dinosaur hesitated. Too cold, Tim thought. He won\u0027t go in there, it\u0027s too cold, he won\u0027t go in he won\u0027t go in he won\u0027t go in. . . .\n The dinosaur went in.\n The head disappeared, then the body, then the stiff tail.\n Tim sprinted, flinging his weight against the stainless-steel door of the locker, slamming it shut. It slammed on the tip of the tail! The door wouldn\u0027t shut! The velociraptor roared, a terrifying loud sound. Inadvertently, Tim took a step back-the tail was gone! He slammed the door shut and heard it click! Closed!\n \"Lex! Lex!\" he was screaming. He heard the raptor pounding against the door, felt it thumping the steel. He knew there was a flat steel knob inside, and if the raptor hit that, it would knock the door open. They had to get the door locked. \"Lex!\"\n Lex was by his side. \"What do you want!\"\n Tim leaned against the horizontal door handle, holding it shut. \"There\u0027s a pin! A little pin! Get the pin!\"\n The velociraptor roared like a lion, the sound muffled by the thick steel. It crashed its whole body against the door.\n \"I can\u0027t see anything!\" Lex shouted.\n The pin was dangling beneath the door handle, swinging on a little metal chain. \"It\u0027s right there!\"\n \"I can\u0027t see it!\" she screamed, and then Tim realized she wasn\u0027t wearing the goggles.\n \"Feel for it!\"\n He saw her little hand reaching up, touching his, groping for the pin, and with her so close to him he could feel how frightened she was, her breath in little panicky gasps as she felt for the pin, and the velociraptor slammed against the door and it opened-God, it opened-but the animal hadn\u0027t expected that and had already turned back for another try and Tim slammed the door shut again. Lex scrambled back, reached up in the darkness.\n \"I have it!\" Lex cried, clutching the pin in her hand, and she pushed it through the hole. It slid out again.\n \"From the top, put it in from the top!\"\n She held it again, lifting it on the chain, swinging it over the handle, and down. Into the hole.\n Locked.\n The velociraptor roared. Tim and Lex stepped back from the door as the dinosaur slammed into it again. With each impact, the heavy steel wall hinges creaked, but they held. Tim didn\u0027t think the animal could possibly open the door.\n The raptor was locked in.\n He gave a long sigh. \"Let\u0027s go,\" he said.\n He took her hand, and they ran.\n \"You should have seen them,\" Gennaro said, as Grant led him back out of the maintenance building. \"There must have been two dozen of them. Compys. I had to crawl into the truck to get away from them. They were all over the windshield. Just squatting there, waiting like buzzards. But they ran away when you came over.\"\n \"Scavengers,\" Grant said. \"They won\u0027t attack anything that\u0027s moving or looks strong. They attack things that are dead, or almost dead. Anyway, unmoving.\"\n They were going up the ladder now, back toward the entrance door.\n \"What happened to the raptor that attacked you?\" Grant said.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Gennaro said.\n \"Did it leave?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t see. I got away, I think because it was injured. I think Muldoon shot it in the leg and it was bleeding while it was in here. Then . . . I don\u0027t know. Maybe it went back outside. Maybe it died in here. I didn\u0027t see.\"\n \"And maybe it\u0027s still in here,\" Grant said.\n Wu stared out the lodge window at the raptors beyond the fence. They still seemed playful, making mock attacks at Ellie. The behavior had continued for a long time now, and it occurred to him that it might be too long. It almost seemed as if they were trying to keep Ellie\u0027s attention, in the same way that she was trying to keep theirs.\n The behavior of the dinosaurs had always been a minor consideration for Wu. And rightly so: behavior was a second-order effect of DNA, like protein enfolding. You couldn\u0027t really predict behavior, and you couldn\u0027t really control it, except in very crude ways, like making an animal dependent on a dietary substance by withholding an enzyme. But, in general, behavioral effects were simply beyond the reach of understanding. You couldn\u0027t look at a DNA sequence and predict behavior. It was impossible.\n And that had made Wu\u0027s DNA work purely empirical. It was a matter of tinkering, the way a modern workman might repair an antique grandfather clock. You were dealing with something out of the past, something constructed of ancient materials and following ancient rules. You couldn\u0027t be certain why it worked as it did, and it had been repaired and modified many times already, by forces of evolution, over eons of time. So, like the workman who makes an adjustment and then sees if the clock runs any better, Wu would make an adjustment and then see if the animals behaved any better. And he only tried to correct gross behavior: uncontrolled butting of the electrical fences, or rubbing the skin raw on tree trunks. Those were the behaviors that sent him back to the drawing board.\n And the limits of his science had left him with a mysterious feeling about the dinosaurs in the park. He was never sure, never really sure at all, whether the behavior of the animals was historically accurate or not. Were they behaving as they really had in the past? It was an open question, ultimately unanswerable.\n And though Wu would never admit it, the discovery that the dinosaurs were breeding represented a tremendous validation of his work. A breeding animal was demonstrably effective in a fundamental way; it implied that Wu had put all the pieces together correctly. He had re-created an animal millions of years old, with such precision that the creature could even reproduce itself.\n But, still, looking at the raptors outside, he was troubled by the persistence of their behavior. Raptors were intelligent, and intelligent animals got bored quickly. Intelligent animals also formed plans, and-\n Harding came out into the hallway from Malcolm\u0027s room. \"Where\u0027s Ellie?\"\n \"Still outside.\"\n \"Better get her in. The raptors have left the skylight.\"\n \"When?\" Wu said, moving to the door.\n \"Just a moment ago,\" Harding said.\n Wu threw open the front door. \"Ellie! Inside, now!\"\n She looked over at him, puzzled. \"There\u0027s no problem, everything\u0027s under control. . . .\"\n \"Now!\"\n She shook her head. \"I know what I\u0027m doing,\" she said.\n \"Now, Ellie, damn it!\"\n Muldoon didn\u0027t like Wu standing there with the door open, and he was about to say so, when he saw a shadow descend from above, and he realized at once what had happened. Wu was yanked bodily out the door, and Muldoon heard Ellie screaming. Muldoon got to the door and looked out and saw that Wu was lying on his back, his body already torn open by the big claw, and the raptor was jerking its head, tugging at Wu\u0027s intestines even though Wu was still alive, still feebly reaching up with his hands to push the big head away, he was being eaten while he was still alive, and then Ellie stopped screaming and started to run along the inside of the fence, and Muldoon slammed the door shut, dizzy with horror. It had happened so fast!\n Harding said, \"He jumped down from the roof?\"\n Muldoon nodded. He went to the window and looked out, and he saw that the three raptors outside the fence were now running away. But they weren\u0027t following Ellie.\n They were going back, toward the visitor center.\n Grant came to the edge of the maintenance building and peered forward, in the fog. He could hear the snarls of the raptors, and they seemed to be coming closer. Now he could see their bodies running past him. They were going to the visitor center.\n He looked back at Gennaro.\n Gennaro shook his head, no.\n Grant leaned close and whispered in his ear. \"No choice. We\u0027ve got to turn on the computer.\"\n Grant set out in the fog.\n After a moment, Gennaro followed.\n Ellie didn\u0027t stop to think. When the raptors dropped inside the fence to attack Wu, she just turned and ran, as fast as she could, toward the far end of the lodge. There was a space fifteen feet wide between the fence and the lodge. She ran, not hearing the animals pursuing her, just hearing her own breath. She rounded the corner, saw a tree growing by the side of the building, and leapt, grabbing a branch, swinging up. She didn\u0027t feel panic. She felt a kind of exhilaration as she kicked and saw her legs rise up In front of her face, and she hooked her legs over a branch farther up, tightened her gut, and pulled up quickly.\n She was already twelve feet off the ground, and the raptors still weren\u0027t following her, and she was beginning to feel pretty good, when she saw the first animal at the base of the tree. Its mouth was bloody, and bits of stringy flesh hung from its jaws. She continued to go up fast, hand over hand, just reaching and going, and she could almost see the top of the building. She looked down again.\n The two raptors were climbing the tree.\n Now she was at the level of the rooftop, she could see the gravel only four feet away, and the glass pyramids of the skylights, sticking up in the mist. There was a door on the roof; she could get inside. In a single heaving effort she flung herself through the air, and landed sprawling on the gravel. She scraped her face, but somehow the only sensation was exhilaration, as if it were a kind of game she was playing, a game she intended to win. She ran for the door that led to the stairwell. Behind her, she could hear the raptors shaking the branches of the tree. They were still in the tree.\n She reached the door, and twisted the knob. The door was locked.\n It took a moment for the meaning of that to cut through her euphoria. The door was locked. She was on the roof and she couldn\u0027t get down. The door was locked.\n She pounded on the door in frustration, and then she ran for the far side of the roof, hoping to see a way down, but there was only the green outline of the swimming pool through the blowing mist. All around the pool was concrete decking. Ten, twelve feet of concrete. Too much for her to jump across. No other trees to climb down. No stairs. No fire escape.\n Nothing.\n Ellie turned back, and saw the raptors jumping easily to the roof. She ran to the far end of the building, hoping there might be another door there, but there wasn\u0027t.\n The raptors came slowly toward her, stalking her, slipping silently among the glass pyramids. She looked down. The edge of the pool was ten feet away.\n Too far.\n The raptors were closer, starting to move apart, and illogically she thought: Isn\u0027t this always the way? Some little mistake screws it all up. She still felt giddy, still felt exhilaration, and she somehow couldn\u0027t believe these animals were going to get her, she couldn\u0027t believe that now her life was going to end like this. It didn\u0027t seem possible. She was enveloped in a kind of protective cheerfulness. She just didn\u0027t believe it would happen.\n The raptors snarled. Ellie backed away, moving to the far end of the roof. She took a breath, and then began to sprint toward the edge. As she raced toward the edge, she saw the swimming pool, and she knew it was too far away but she thought, What the hell, and leapt into space.\n And fell.\n And with a stinging shock, she felt herself enveloped in coldness. She was underwater. She had done it! She came to the surface and looked up at the roof, and saw the raptors looking down at her. And she knew that, if she could do it, the raptors could do it, too. She splashed in the water and thought, Can raptors swim? But she was sure they could. They could probably swim like crocodiles.\n The raptors turned away from the edge of the roof. And then she heard Harding calling \"Sattler?\" and she realized he had opened the roof door. The raptors were going toward him.\n Hurriedly, she climbed out of the pool and ran toward the lodge.\n Harding had gone up the steps to the roof two at a time, and he had flung open the door without thinking. \"Sattler!\" he shouted. And then he stopped. Mist blew among the pyramids on the roof. The raptors were not in sight.\n \"Sattler!\"\n He was so preoccupied with Sattler that it was a moment before he realized his mistake. He should be able to see the animals, he thought. In the next instant the clawed forearm smashed around the side of the door, catching him in the chest with a tearing pain, and it took all of his effort to pull himself backward and close the door on the arm, and from downstairs he heard Muldoon sbouting, \"She\u0027s here, she\u0027s already inside.\"\n From the other side of the door, the raptor snarled, and Harding slammed the door again, and the claws pulled back, and he closed the door with a metallic clang and sank coughing to the floor.\n \"Where are we going?\" Lex said. They were on the second floor of the visitor center. A glass-walled corridor ran the length of the building.\n \"To the control room , Tim said.\n \"Where\u0027s that?\"\n \"Down here someplace.\" Tim looked at the names stenciled on the doors as he went past them. These seemed to be offices: PARK WARDEN GUEST SERVICES . . . GENERAL MANAGER . . . COMPTROLLER . . .\n They came to a glass partition marked with a sign:\n CLOSED AREA\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\n BEYOND THIS POINT\n There was a slot for a security card, but Tim just pushed the door open.\n \"How come it opened?\"\n \"The power is out,\" Tim said.\n \"Why\u0027re we going to the control room?\" she asked.\n \"To find a radio. We need to call somebody.\"\n Beyond the glass door the hallway continued. Tim remembered this area; he had seen it earlier, during the tour. Lex trotted along at his side. In the distance, they heard the snarling of raptors. The animals seemed to be approaching. Then Tim heard them slamming against the glass downstairs.\n \"They\u0027re out there . . .\" Lex whispered.\n \"Don\u0027t worry.\"\n \"What are they doing here?\" Lex said.\n \"Never mind now.\"\n PARK SUPERVISOR . . . OPERATIONS . . . MAIN CONTROL . . .\n \"Here,\" Tim said. He pushed open the door. The main control room was as he had seen it before. In the center of the room was a console with four chairs and four computer monitors. The room was entirely dark except for the monitors, which all showed a series of colored rectangles.\n \"So where\u0027s a radio?\" Lex said.\n But Tim had forgotten all about a radio. He moved forward, staring at the computer screens. The screens were on! That could only mean-\n \"The power must be back on. . . .\"\n \"Ick,\" Lex said, shifting her body.\n \"What.\"\n \"I was standing on somebody\u0027s ear, \" she said.\n Tim hadn\u0027t seen a body when they came in. He looked back and saw there was just an ear, lying on the floor.\n \"That is really disgusting,\" Lex said.\n \"Never mind.\" He turned to the monitors.\n \"Where\u0027s the rest of him?\" she said.\n \"Never mind that now.\"\n He peered closely at the monitor. There were rows of colored labels on the screen:\n [picture]\n \"You better not fool around with that, Timmy,\" she said.\n \"Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t.\"\n He had seen complicated computers before, like the ones that were installed in the buildings his father worked on. Those computers controlled everything from the elevators and security to the heating and cooling systems. They looked basically like this-a lot of colored labels-but they were usually simpler to understand. And almost always there was a help label, if you needed to learn about the system. But he saw no help label here. He looked again, to be sure.\n But then he saw something else: numerals clicking in the upper left corner of the screen. They read 10:47:22. Then Tim realized it was the time. There were only thirteen minutes left for the boat-but he was more worried about the people in the lodge.\n There was a static crackle. He turned, and saw Lex holding a radio. She was twisting the knobs and dials. \"How does it work?\" she said. \"I can\u0027t make it work.\"\n \"Give me that!\"\n \"It\u0027s mine! I found it!\"\n \"Give it to me, Lex!\"\n \"I get to use it first!\"\n \"Lex!\"\n Suddenly, the radio crackled. \"What the hell is going on!\" said Muldoon\u0027s voice.\n Surprised, Lex dropped the radio on the floor.\n Grant ducked back, crouching among the palm trees. Through the mist ahead he could see the raptors hopping and snarling and butting their heads against the glass of the visitor center. But, between snarls, they would fall silent and cock their heads, as if listening to something distant. And then they would make little whimpering sounds.\n \"What\u0027re they doing?\" Gennaro said.\n \"It looks like they\u0027re trying to get into the cafeteria,\" Grant said. \"What\u0027s in the cafeteria?\"\n \"I left the kids there . . .\" Grant said.\n \"Can they break through that glass?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so, no.\"\n Grant watched, and now he heard the crackle of a distant radio, and the raptors began hopping in a more agitated way. One after another, they began jumping higher and higher, until finally he saw the first of them leap lightly onto the second-floor balcony, and from there move inside the second floor of the visitor center.\n In the control room on the second floor, Tim snatched up the radio which Lex had dropped. He pressed the button. \"Hello? Hello?\"\n \"-s that you, Tim?\" It was Muldoon\u0027s voice.\n \"It\u0027s me, yes.\"\n \"Where are you?\"\n \"In the control room. The power is on!\"\n \"That\u0027s great, Tim,\" Muldoon said.\n \"If someone will tell me how to turn the computer on, I\u0027ll do it.\" There was a silence.\n \"Hello?\" Tim said. \"Did you hear me?\"\n \"Ah, we have a problem about that,\" Muldoon said. \"Nobody, ah, who is here knows how to do that. How to turn the computer on.\"\n Tim said, \"What, are you kidding? Nobody knows?\" It seemed incredible.\n \"No.\" A pause. \"I think it\u0027s something about the main grid. Turning on the main grid . . . You know anything about computers, Tim?\"\n Tim stared at the screen. Lex nudged him. \"Tell him no, Timmy,\" she said.\n \"Yes, some. I know something,\" Tim said.\n \"Might as well try,\" Muldoon said. \"Nobody here knows what to do. And Grant doesn\u0027t know about computers.\"\n \"Okay,\" Tim said. \"I\u0027ll try.\" He clicked off the radio and stared at the screen, studying it.\n \"Timmy,\" Lex said. \"You don\u0027t know what to do.\"\n \"Yes I do.\"\n \"If you know, then do it,\" Lex said.\n \"Just a minute.\" As a way to get started, he pulled the chair close to the keyboard and pressed the cursor keys. Those were the keys that moved the cursor around on the screen. But nothing happened. Then he pushed other keys. The screen remained unchanged.\n \"Well?\" she said.\n \"Something\u0027s wrong,\" Tim said, frowning.\n \"You just don\u0027t know, Timmy,\" she said.\n He examined the computer again, looking at it carefully. The keyboard had a row of function keys at the top, just like a regular PC keyboard, and the monitor was big and in color. But the monitor housing was sort of unusual. Tim looked at the edges of the screen and saw lots of faint pinpoints of red light.\n Red light, all around the borders of the screen . . . What could that be? He moved his finger toward the light and saw the soft red glow on his skin.\n He touched the screen and heard a beep.\n [picture]\n A moment later, the message box disappeared, and the original screen flashed back up.\n \"What happened?\" Lex said. \"What did you do? You touched something.\"\n Of course! he thought. He had touched the screen. It was a touch screen! The red lights around the edges must be infrared sensors. Tim had never seen such a screen, but he\u0027d read about them in magazines. He touched\n RESET/REVERT.\n Instantly the screen changed. He got a new message:\n THE COMPUTER IS NOW RESET\n MAKE YOUR SELECTION FROM THE MAIN SCREEN\n Over the radio, they heard the sound of raptors snarling. \"I want to see,\" Lex said. \"You should try VIEW.\"\n \"No, Lex.\"\n \"Well, I want VIEW,\" she said. And before he could grab her hand, she had pressed VIEW. The screen changed.\n [picture]\n \"Uh-oh,\" she said.\n \"Lex, will you cut it out?\"\n \"Look!\" she said. \"it worked! Ha!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jurassic-park-jurassic-park-1/page-25.html","bookId":1711,"book":{"id":1711,"title":"Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1) \n An astonishing technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA has been discovered.
