That\u0027s why we have this nursery. It\u0027s the only way to replace stock in Jurassic Park.\"\n \"Why can\u0027t the animals breed?\"\n \"Well, as you can imagine, it\u0027s important that they not be able to breed,\" Wu said. \"And whenever we faced a critical matter such as this, we designed redundant systems. That is, we always arranged at least two control procedures. In this case, there are two independent reasons why the animals can\u0027t breed. First of a they\u0027re sterile, because we irradiate them with X-rays.\"\n \"And the second reason?\"\n \"All the animals in Jurassic Park are female,\" Wu said, with a pleased smile.\n Malcolm said, \"I should like some clarification about this. Because it seems to me that irradiation is fraught with uncertainty. The radiation dose may be wrong, or aimed at the wrong anatomical area of the animal-\"\n \"All true,\" Wu said. \"But we\u0027re quite confident we have destroyed gonadal tissue.\"\n \"And as for them all being female,\" Malcolm said, \"is that checked? Does anyone go out and, ah, lift up the dinosaurs\u0027 skirts to have a look? I mean, how does one determine the sex of a dinosaur, anyway?\"\n \"Sex organs vary with the species. It\u0027s easy to tell on some, subtle on others. But, to answer your question, the reason we know all the animals are female is that we literally make them that way: we control their chromosomes, and we control the intra-egg developmental environment. From a bioengineering standpoint, females are easier to breed. You probably know that all vertebrate embryos are inherently female. We all start life as females. It takes some kind of added effect-such as a hormone at the right moment during development-to transform the growing embryo into a male. But, left to its own devices, the embryo will naturally become female. So our animals are all female. We tend to refer to some of them as male-such as the Tyrannosaurus rex; we all call it a \u0027him\u0027-but in fact, they\u0027re all female. And, believe me, they can\u0027t breed.\"\n The little velociraptor sniffed at Tim, and then rubbed her head against Tim\u0027s neck. Tim giggled.\n \"She wants you to feed her,\" Wu said.\n \"What does she eat?\"\n \"Mice. But she\u0027s just eaten, so we won\u0027t feed her again for a while.\"\n The little raptor leaned back, stared at Tim, and wiggled her forearms again in the air. Tim saw the small claws on the three fingers of each hamd. Then the raptor burrowed her head against his neck again.\n Grant came over, and peered critically at the creature. He touched the tiny three-clawed band. He said to Tim, \"Do you mind?\" and Tim released the raptor into his hands.\n Grant flipped the animal onto its back, inspecting it, while the little lizard wiggled and squirmed. Then he lifted the animal high to look at its profile, and it screamed shrilly.\n \"She doesn\u0027t like that,\" Regis said. \"Doesn\u0027t like to be held away from body contact. . . .\"\n The raptor was still screaming, but Grant paid no attention. Now he was squeezing the tail, feeling the bones. Regis said, \"Dr. Grant. If you please.\"\n \"I\u0027m not hurting her.\"\n \"Dr. Grant. These creatures are not of our world. They come from a time when there were no human beings around to prod and poke them.\"\n \"I\u0027m not prodding and-\"\n \"Dr. Grant. Put her down, \" Ed Regis said.\n \"But-\"\n \"Now. \" Regis was starting to get annoyed.\n Grant handed the animal back to Tim. It stopped squealing. Tim could feel its little heart beating rapidly against his chest.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Dr. Grant,\" Regis said. \"But these animals are delicate in infancy. We have lost several from a postnatal stress syndrome, which we believe is adrenocortically mediated. Sometimes they die within five minutes.\"\n Tim petted the little raptor. \"It\u0027s okay, kid,\" he said. \"Everything\u0027s fine now.\" The heart was still beating rapidly.\n \"We feel it is important that the animals here be treated in the most humane manner,\" Regis said. \"I promise you that you will have every opportunity to examine them later.\"\n But Grant couldn\u0027t stay away. He again moved toward the animal in Tim\u0027s arms, peering at it.\n The little velociraptor opened her jaws and hissed at Grant, in a posture of sudden intense fury.\n \"Fascinating,\" Grant said.\n \"Can I stay and play with her?\" Tim said.\n \"Not right now,\" Ed Regis said, glancing at his watch. \"It\u0027s three o\u0027clock, and it\u0027s a good time for a tour of the park itself, so you can see all the dinosaurs in the habitats we have designed for them.\"\n Tim released the velociraptor, which scampered across the room, grabbed a cloth rag, put it in her mouth, and tugged at the end with her tiny claws.\n Control\n Walking back toward the control room, Malcolm said, \"I have one more question, Dr. Wu. How many different species have you made so far?\"\n \"I\u0027m not exactly sure,\" Wu said. \"I believe the number at the moment is fifteen. Fifteen species. Do you know, Ed?\"\n \"Yes, it\u0027s fifteen,\" Ed Regis said, nodding.\n \"You don\u0027t know for sure?\" Malcolm said, affecting astonishment.\n Wu smiled. \"I stopped counting,\" he said, \"after the first dozen. And you have to realize that sometimes we think we have an animal correctly made-from the standpoint of the DNA, which is our basic work-and the animal grows for six months and then something untoward happens. And we realize there is some error. A releaser gene isn\u0027t operating. A hormone not being released. Or some other problem in the developmental sequence. So we have to go back to the drawing board with that animal, so to speak.\" He smiled. \"At one time, I thought I had more than twenty species, But now, only fifteen.\"\n \"And is one of the fifteen species a-\" Malcolm turned to Grant. \"What was the name?\"\n \"Procompsognathus, \" Grant said.\n \"You have made some procompsognathuses, or whatever they\u0027re called?\" Malcolm asked.\n \"Oh yes,\" Wu said immediately. \"Compys are very distinctive animals. And, we made an unusually large number of them.\"\n \"Why is that?\"\n \"Well, we want Jurassic Park to be as real an environment as possible-as authentic as possible-and the procompsognathids are actual scavengers from the Jurassic period. Rather like jackals. So we wanted to have the compys around to clean up.\"\n \"You mean to dispose of carcasses?\"\n \"Yes, if there were any. But with only two hundred and thirty-odd animals in our total population, we don\u0027t have many carcasses,\" Wu said. \"That wasn\u0027t the primary objective. Actually, we wanted the compys for another kind of waste management entirely.\"\n \"Which was?\"\n \"Well,\" Wu said, \"we have some very big herbivores on this island. We have specifically tried not to breed the biggest sauropods, but even so, we\u0027ve got several animals in excess of thirty tons walking around out there, and many others in the five- to ten-ton area. That gives us two problems. One is feeding them, and in fact we must import food to the island every two weeks. There is no way an island this small can support these animals for any time.\n \"But the other problem is waste. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve ever seen elephant droppings,\" Wu said, \"but they are substantial. Each spoor is roughly the size of a soccer ball. Imagine the droppings of a brontosaur, ten times as large. Now imagine the droppings of a herd of such animals, as we keep here. And the largest animals do not digest their food terribly well, so that they excrete a great deal. And in the sixty million years since dinosaurs disappeared, apparently the bacteria that specialize in breaking down their feces disappeared, too. At least, the sauropod feces don\u0027t decompose readily.\"\n \"That\u0027s a problem,\" Malcolm said.\n \"I assure you it is,\" Wu said, not smiling. \"We had a hell of a time trying to solve it. You probably know that in Africa there is a specific insect, the dung beetle, which eats elephant feces. Many other large species have associated creatures that have evolved to eat their excrement. Well, it turns out that compys will eat the feces of large herbivores and redigest it. And the droppings of compys are readily broken down by contemporary bacteria. So, given enough compys, our problem was solved.\"\n \"How many compys did you make?\"\n \"I\u0027ve forgotten exactly, but I think the target population was fifty animals. And we attained that, or very nearly so. In three batches. We did a batch every six months until we had the number.\"\n \"Fifty animals,\" Malcolm said, \"is a lot to keep track of.\"\n \"The control room is built to do exactly that. They\u0027ll show you how it\u0027s done.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure,\" Malcolm said. \"But if one of these compys were to escape from the island, to get away .\n \"They can\u0027t get away.\"\n \"I know that, but just supposing one did . . .\"\n \"You mean like the animal that was found on the beach?\" Wu said, raising his eyebrows. \"The one that bit the American girl?\"\n \"Yes, for example.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what the explanation for that animal is,\" Wu said. \"But I know it can\u0027t possibly be one of ours, for two reasons. First, the control procedures: our animals are counted by computer every few minutes. If one were missing, we\u0027d know at once.\"\n \"And the second reason?\"\n \"The mainland is more than a hundred miles away. It takes almost a day to get there by boat. And in the outside world our animals will die within twelve hours,\" Wu said.\n \"How do you know?\"\n \"Because I\u0027ve made sure that\u0027s precisely what will occur,\" Wu said, finally showing a trace of irritation. \"Look, we\u0027re not fools. We understand these are prehistoric animals. They are part of a vanished ecology-a complex web of life that became extinct millions of years ago. They might have no predators in the contemporary world, no checks on their growth. We don\u0027t want them to survive in the wild. So I\u0027ve made them lysine dependent. I inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. As a result, the animals cannot manufacture the amino acid lysine. They must ingest it from the outside. Unless they get a rich dietary source of exogenous lysine-supplied by us, in tablet form-they\u0027ll go into a coma within twelve hours and expire. These animals are genetically engineered to be unable to survive in the real world. They can only live here in Jurassic Park. They are not free at all. They are essentially our prisoners.\"\n \"Here\u0027s the control room,\" Ed Regis said. \"Now that you know how the animals are made, you\u0027ll want to see the control room for the park itself, before we go out on the-\"\n He stopped. Through the thick glass window, the room was dark. The monitors were off, except for three that displayed spinning numbers and the image of a large boat.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" Ed Regis said. \"Oh hell, they\u0027re docking.\"\n \"Docking?\"\n \"Every two weeks, the supply boat comes in from the mainland. One of the things this island doesn\u0027t have is a good harbor, or even a good dock. It\u0027s a little hairy to get the ship in, when the seas are rough. Could be a few minutes.\" He rapped on the window, but the men inside paid no attention. \"I guess we have to wait, then.\"\n Ellie turned to Dr. Wu. \"You mentioned before that sometimes you make an animal and it seems to be fine but, as it grows, it shows itself to be flawed. . . .\"\n \"Yes,\" Wu said. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way around that. We can duplicate the DNA, but there is a lot of timing in development, and we don\u0027t know if everything is working unless we actually see an animal develop correctly.\"\n Grant said, \"How do you know if it\u0027s developing correctly? No one has ever seen these animals before.\"\n Wu smiled. \"I have often thought about that. I suppose it is a bit of a paradox. Eventually, I hope, paleontologists such as yourself will compare our animals with the fossil record to verify the developmental sequence.\"\n Ellie said, \"But the animal we just saw, the velociraptor-you said it was a mongoliensis?\"\n \"From the location of the amber,\" Wu said. \"It it is from China.\"\n \"Interesting,\" Grant said. \"I was just digging up an infant antirrhopus. Are there any full-grown raptors here?\"\n \"Yes,\" Ed Regis said without hesitation. \"Eight adult females. The females are the real hunters. They\u0027re pack hunters, you know.\"\n \"Will we see them on the tour?\"\n \"No,\" Wu said, looking suddenly uncomfortable. And there was an awkward pause. Wu looked at Regis.\n \"Not for a while,\" Regis said cheerfully. \"The velociraptors haven\u0027t been integrated into the park setting just yet. We keep them in a holding pen,\"\n \"Can I see them there?\" Grant said.\n \"Why, yes, of course. In fact, while we\u0027re waiting\"-he glanced at his watch-\"you might want to go around and have a look at them.\"\n \"I certainly would,\" Grant said.\n \"Absolutely,\" Ellie said.\n \"I want to go, too,\" Tim said eagerly.\n \"Just go around the back of this building, past the support facility, and you\u0027ll see the pen. But don\u0027t get too close to the fence. Do you want to go, too?\" he said to the girl.\n \"No,\" Lex said. She looked appraisingly at Regis. \"You want to play a little pickle? Throw a few?\"\n \"Well, sure,\" Ed Regis said. \"Why don\u0027t you and I go downstairs and we\u0027ll do that, while we wait for the control room to open up?\"\n Grant walked with Ellie and Malcolm around the back of the main building, with the kid tagging along. Grant liked kids-it was impossible not to like any group so openly enthusiastic about dinosaurs. Grant used to watch kids in museums as they stared open-mouthed at the big skeletons rising above them. He wondered what their fascination really represented. He finally decided that children liked dinosaurs because these giant creatures personified the uncontrollable force of looming authority. They were symbolic parents. Fascinating and frightening, like parents. And kids loved them, as they loved their parents.\n Grant also suspected that was why even young children learned the names of dinosaurs. It never failed to amaze him when a three-year-old shrieked: \"Stegosaurus!\" Saying these complicated names was a way of exerting power over the giants, a way of being in control.\n \"What do you know about Velociraptor? \" Grant asked Tim. He was just making conversation.\n \"It\u0027s a small carnivore that hunted in packs, like Deinonychus, \" Tim said.\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Grant said, \"although the evidence for pack hunting is all circumstantial. It derives in part from the appearance of the animals, which are quick and strong, but small for dinosaurs-just a hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds each. We assume they hunted in groups if they were to bring down larger prey. And there are some fossil finds in which a single large prey animal is associated with several raptor skeletons, suggesting they hunted in packs. And, of course, raptors were large-brained, more intelligent than most dinosaurs.\"\n \"How intelligent is that?\" Malcolm asked.\n \"Depends on who you talk to,\" Grant said. \"Just as paleontologists have come around to the idea that dinosaurs were probably warm-blooded, a lot of us are starting to think some of them might have been quite intelligent, too. But nobody knows for sure.\"\n They left the visitor area behind, and soon they heard the loud hum of generators, smelled the faint odor of gasoline. They passed a grove of palm trees and saw a large, low concrete shed with a steel roof. The noise seemed to come from there. They looked in the shed.\n \"It must be a generator,\" Ellie said.\n \"It\u0027s big,\" Grant said, peering inside.\n The power plant actually extended two stories below ground level: a vast complex of whining turbines and piping that ran down in the earth, lit by harsh electric bulbs. \"They can\u0027t need all this just for a resort,\" Malcolm said. \"They\u0027re generating enough power here for a small city.\"\n \"Maybe for the computers?\"\n \"Maybe.\"\n Grant heard bleating, and walked north a few yards. He came to an animal enclosure with goats. By a quick count, he estimated there were fifty or sixty goats.\n \"What\u0027s that for?\" Ellie asked.\n \"Beats me.\"\n \"Probably they feed \u0027em to the dinosaurs,\" Malcolm said.\n The group walked on, following a dirt path through a dense bamboo grove. At the far side, they came to a double-layer chain-link fence twelve feet high, with spirals of barbed wire at the top. There was an electric hum along the outer fence.\n Beyond the fences, Grant saw dense clusters of large ferns, five feet high. He heard a snorting sound, a kind of snuffling. Then the sound of crunching footsteps, coming closer.\n Then a long silence.\n \"I don\u0027t see anything,\" Tim whispered, finally.\n \"Ssssh.\"\n Grant waited. Several seconds passed. Flies buzzed in the air. He still saw nothing.\n Ellie tapped him on the shoulder, and pointed.\n Amid the ferns, Grant saw the head of an animal. It was motionless, partially hidden in the fronds, the two large dark eyes watching them coldly.\n The head was two feet long. From a pointed snout, a long row of teeth ran back to the hole of the auditory meatus which served as an ear. The head reminded him of a large lizard, or perhaps a crocodile. The eyes did not blink, and the animal did not move. Its skin was leathery, with a pebbled texture, and basically the same coloration as the infant\u0027s: yellow-brown with darker reddish markings, like the stripes of a tiger.\n As Grant watched, a single forelimb reached up very slowly to part the ferns beside the animal\u0027s face. The limb, Grant saw, was strongly muscled. The hand had three grasping fingers, each ending in curved claws. The band gently, slowly, pushed aside the ferns.\n Grant felt a chill and thought, He\u0027s hunting us.\n For a mammal like man, there was something indescribably alien about the way reptiles hunted their prey. No wonder men hated reptiles. The stillness, the coldness, the pace was all wrong. To be among alligators or other large reptiles was to be reminded of a different kind of life, a different kind of world, now vanished from the earth. Of course, this animal didn\u0027t realize that he had been spotted, that he-\n The attack came suddenly, from the left and right. Charging raptors covered the ten yards to the fence with shocking speed. Grant had a blurred impression of powerful, six-foot-tall bodies, stiff balancing tails, limbs with curving claws, open jaws with rows of jagged teetb.\n The animals snarled as they came forward, and then leapt bodily into the air, raising their hind legs with their big dagger-claws. Then they struck the fence in front of them, throwing off twin bursts of hot sparks.\n The veloctiraptors fell backward to the ground, hissing. The visitors all moved forward, fascinated. Only then did the third animal attack, leaping up to strike the fence at chest level. Tim screamed in fright as the sparks exploded all around him. The creatures snarled, a low reptilian hissing sound, and leapt back among the ferns. Then they were gone, leaving behind a faint odor of decay, and banging acrid smoke.\n \"Holy shit,\" Tim said.\n \"It was so fast,\" Ellie said.\n \"Pack hunters,\" Grant said, shaking his head. \"Pack hunters for whom ambush is an instinct . . . Fascinating.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t call them tremendously intelligent,\" Malcolm said.\n On the other side of the fence, they heard snorting in the palm trees. Several heads poked slowly out of the foliage. Grant counted three . . . four . . . five . . . The animals watched them. Staring coldly.\n A black man in coveralls came running up to them. \"Are you all right?\"\n \"We\u0027re okay,\" Grant said.\n \"The alarms were set off.\" The man looked at the fence, dented and charred. \"They attacked you?\"\n \"Three of them did, yes.\"\n The black man nodded. \"They do that all the time. Hit the fence, take a shock. They never seem to mind.\"\n \"Not too smart, are they?\" Malcolm said.\n The black man paused. He squinted at Malcolm in the afternoon light, \"Be glad for that fence, se?or, \" he said, and turned away.\n From beginning to end, the entire attack could not have taken more than six seconds. Grant was still trying to organize his impressions. The speed was astonishing-the animals were so fast, he had hardly seen them move.\n Walking back, Malcolm said, \"They are remarkably fast.\"\n \"Yes,\" Grant said. \"Much faster than any living reptile. A bull alligator can move quickly, but only over a short distance-five or six feet. Big lizards like the five-foot Komodo dragons of Indonesia have been clocked at thirty miles an hour, fast enough to run down a man. And they kill men all the time. But I\u0027d guess the animal behind the fence was more than twice that fast.\"\n \"Cheetah speed,\" Malcolm said. \"Sixty, seventy miles an hour.\"\n \"Exactly.\"\n \"But they seemed to dart forward,\" Malcolm said. \"Rather like birds.\"\n \"Yes.\" In the contemporary world, only very small mammals, like the cobra-fighting mongoose, had such quick responses. Small mammals, and of course birds. The snake-hunting secretary bird of Africa, or the cassowary. In fact, the velociraptor conveyed precisely the same impression of deadly, swift menace Grant had seen in the cassowary, the clawed ostrich-like bird of New Guinea.\n \"So these velociraptors look like reptiles, with the skin and general appearance of reptiles, but they move like birds, with the speed and predatory intelligence of birds. Is that about it?\" Malcolm said.\n \"Yes,\" Grant said. \"I\u0027d say they display a mixture of traits.\"\n \"Does that surprise you?\"\n \"Not really,\" Grant said. \"It\u0027s actually rather close to what paleontologists believed a long time ago.\"\n When the first giant bones were found in the 1820s and 1830s, scientists felt obliged to explain the bones as belonging to some oversize variant of a modern species. This was because it was believed that no species could ever become extinct, since God would not allow one of His creations to die.\n Eventually it became clear that this conception of God was mistaken, and the bones belonged to extinct animals. But what kind of animals?\n In 1842, Richard Owen, the leading British anatomist of the day, called them Dinosauria, meaning \"terrible lizards.\" Owen recognized that dinosaurs seemed to combine traits of lizards, crocodiles, and birds. In particular, dinosaur hips were bird-like, not lizard-like. And, unlike lizards, many dinosaurs seemed to stand upright. Owen imagined dinosaurs to be quick-moving, active creatures, and his view was accepted for the next forty years.\n But when truly gigantic finds were unearthed-animals that had weighed a hundred tons in life-scientists began to envision the dinosaurs as stupid, slow-moving giants destined for extinction. The image of the sluggish reptile gradually predominated over the image of the quick-moving bird. In recent years, scientists like Grant had begun to swing back toward the idea of more active dinosaurs. Grant\u0027s colleagues saw him as radical in his conception of dinosaur behavior. But now he had to admit his own conception had fallen far short of the reality of these large, incredibly swift hunters.\n \"Actually, what I was driving at,\" Malcolm said, \"was this: Is it a persuasive animal to you? Is it in fact a dinosaur?\"\n \"I\u0027d say so, yes.\"\n \"And the coordinated attack behavior . . .\"\n \"To be expected,\" Grant said. According to the fossil record, packs of velociraptors were capable of bringing down animals that weighed a thousand pounds, like Tenontosaurus, which could run as fast as a horse. Coordination would be required.\n \"How do they do that, without language?\"\n \"Oh, language isn\u0027t necessary for coordinated hunting,\" Ellie said. \"Chimpanzees do it all the time. A group of chimps will stalk a monkey and kill it. All communication is by eyes.\"\n \"And were the dinosaurs in fact attacking us?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"They would kill us and eat us if they could?\" Malcolm said.\n \"I think so.\"\n \"The reason I ask,\" Malcolm said, \"is that I\u0027m told large predators such as lions and tigers are not born man-eaters. Isn\u0027t that true? These animals must learn somewhere along the way that human beings are easy to kill. Only afterward do they become man-killers.\"\n \"Yes, I believe that\u0027s true,\" Grant said.\n \"Well, these dinosaurs must be even more reluctant than lions and tigers. After all, they come from a time before human beings-or even large mammals-existed at all. God knows what they think when they see us. So I wonder: have they learned, somewhere along the line, that humans are easy to kill?\"\n The group fell silent as they walked.\n \"In any case,\" Malcolm said, \"I shall be extremely interested to see the control room now.\"\n Version 4.4\n \"Was there any problem with the group?\" Hammond asked.\n \"No,\" Henry Wu said, \"there was no problem at all.\"\n \"They accepted your explanation?\"\n \"Why shouldn\u0027t they?\" Wu said. \"It\u0027s all quite straightforward, in the broad strokes. It\u0027s only the details that get sticky. And I wanted to talk about the details with you today. You can think of it as a matter of aesthetics.\"\n John Hammond wrinkled his nose, as if he smelled something disagreeable. \"Aesthetics?\" he repeated.\n They were standing in the living room of Hammond\u0027s elegant bungalow, set back among palm trees in the northern sector of the park. The living room was airy and comfortable, fitted with a half-dozen video monitors showing the animals in the park. The file Wu had brought, stamped ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT: VERSION 4.4, lay on the coffee table.\n Hammond was looking at him in that patient, paternal way. Wu, thirty-three years old, was acutely aware that he had worked for Hammond all his professional life. Hammond had hired him right out of graduate school.\n \"Of course, there are practical consequences as well,\" Wu said. \"I really think you should consider my recommendations for phase two. We should go to version 4.4.\"\n \"You want to replace all the current stock of animals?\" Hammond said.\n \"Yes, I do.\"\n \"Why? What\u0027s wrong with them?\"\n \"Nothing,\" Wu said, \"except that they\u0027re real dinosaurs.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I asked for, Henry,\" Hammond said, smiling. \"And that\u0027s what you gave me.\"\n \"I know,\" Wu said. \"But you see. . .\" He paused. How could he explain this to Hammond? Hammond hardly ever visited the island. And it was a peculiar situation that Wu was trying to convey. \"Right now, as we stand here, almost no one in the world has ever seen an actual dinosaur. Nobody knows what they\u0027re really like.\"\n \"Yes . . .\"\n \"The dinosaurs we have now are real,\" Wu said, pointing to the screens around the room, \"but in certain ways they are unsatisfactory, Unconvincing. I could make them better.\"\n \"Better in what way?\"\n \"For one thing, they move too fast,\" Henry Wu said. \"People aren\u0027t accustomed to seeing large animals that are so quick. I\u0027m afraid visitors will think the dinosaurs look speeded up, like film running too fast.\"\n \"But, Henry, these are real dinosaurs. You said so yourself.\"\n \"I know,\" Wu said. \"But we could easily breed slower, more domesticated dinosaurs.\"\n \"Domesticated dinosaurs?\" Hammond snorted. \"Nobody wants domesticated dinosaurs, Henry. They want the real thing.\"\n \"But that\u0027s my point,\" Wu said. \"I don\u0027t think they do. They want to see their expectation, which is quite different.\"\n Hammond was frowning.\n \"You said yourself, John, this park is entertainment,\" Wu said. \"And entertainment has nothing to do with reality. Entertainment is antithetical to reality.\"\n Hammond sighed. \"Now, Henry, are we going to have another one of those abstract discussions? You know I like to keep it simple. The dinosaurs we have now are real, and-\"\n \"Well, not exactly,\" Wu said. He paced the living room, pointed to the monitors. \"I don\u0027t think we should kid ourselves. We haven\u0027t re-created the past here. The past is gone. It can never be re-created. What we\u0027ve done is reconstruct the past-or at least a version of the past. And I\u0027m saying we can make a better version.\"\n \"Better than real?\"\n \"Why not?\" Wu said. \"After all, these animals are already modified. We\u0027ve inserted genes to make them patentable, and to make them lysine dependent. And we\u0027ve done everything we can to promote growth, and accelerate development into adulthood.\"\n Hammond shrugged. \"That was inevitable. We didn\u0027t want to wait. We have investors to consider.\"\n \"Of course. But I\u0027m \u0027ust saying, why stop there? Why not push ahead to make exactly the kind of dinosaur that we\u0027d like to see? One that is more acceptable to visitors, and one that is easier for us to handle? A slower, more docile version for our park?\"\n Hammond frowned. \"But then the dinosaurs wouldn\u0027t be real.\"\n \"But they\u0027re not real now,\" Wu said. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to tell you. There isn\u0027t any reality here.\" He shrugged helplessly. He could see he wasn\u0027t getting through. Hammond had never been interested in technical details, and the essence of the argument was technical. How could he explain to Hammond about the reality of DNA dropouts, the patches, the gaps in the sequence that Wu had been obliged to fill in, making the best guesses he could, but still, making guesses, The DNA of the dinosaurs was like old photographs that had been retouched, basically the same as the original but in some places repaired and clarified, and as a result-\n \"Now, Henry,\" Hammond said, putting his arm around Wu\u0027s shoulder. \"If you don\u0027t mind my saying so, I think you\u0027re getting cold feet. You\u0027ve been working very hard for a long time, and you\u0027ve done a hell of a job-a hell of a job-and it\u0027s finally time to reveal to some people what you\u0027ve done.
