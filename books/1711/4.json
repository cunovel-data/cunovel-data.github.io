The temperature was over a hundred degrees. His knees ached, despite the rug-layer\u0027s pads he wore. His lungs burned from the harsh alkaline dust. Sweat dripped off his forehead onto the ground. But Grant was oblivious to the discomfort. His entire attention was focused on the six-inch square of earth in front of him.\n Working patiently with a dental pick and an artist\u0027s camel brush, he exposed the tiny L-shaped fragment of jawbone. It was only an inch long, and no thicker than his little finger. The teeth were a row of small points, and had the characteristic media] angling. Bits of bone flaked away as he dug. Grant paused for a moment to paint the bone with rubber cement before continuing to expose it. There was no question that this was the jawbone from an infant carnivorous dinosaur. Its owner had died seventy-nine million years ago, at the age of about two months. With any luck, Grant might find the rest of the skeleton as well. If so, it would be the first complete skeleton of a baby carnivore -\n \"Hey, Alan!\"\n Alan Grant looked up, blinking in the sunlight. He pulled down his sunglasses, and wiped his forehead with the back of his arm.\n He was crouched on an eroded hillside in the badlands outside Snakewater, Montana. Beneath the great blue bowl of sky, blunted hills, exposed outcroppings of crumbling limestone, stretched for miles in every direction. There was not a tree, or a bush. Nothing but barren rock, hot sun, and whining wind.\n Visitors found the badlands depressingly bleak, but when Grant looked at this landscape, he saw something else entirely. This barren land was what remained of another, very different world, which had vanished eighty million years ago. In his mind\u0027s eye, Grant saw himself back in the warm, swampy bayou that formed the shoreline of a great inland sea. This inland sea was a thousand miles wide, extending all the way from the newly upthrust Rocky Mountains to the sharp, craggy peaks of the Appalachians. All of the American West was underwater. \n At that time, there were thin clouds in the sky overhead, darkened by the smoke of nearby volcanoes. The atmosphere was denser, richer in carbon dioxide. Plants grew rapidly along the shoreline. There were no fish in these waters, but there were clams and snails. Pterosaurs swooped down to scoop algae from the surface. A few carnivorous dinosaurs prowled the swampy shores of the lake, moving among the palm trees. And offshore was a small island, about two acres in size. Ringed with dense vegetation, this island formed a protected sanctuary where herds of herbivorous duckbilled dinosaurs laid their eggs in communal nests, and raised their squeaking young.\n Over the millions of years that followed, the pale green alkaline lake grew shallower, and finally vanished. The exposed land buckled and cracked under the heat. And the offshore island with its dinosaur eggs became the eroded hillside in northern Montana which Alan Grant was now excavating.\n \"Hey, Alan!\"\n He stood, a barrel-chested, bearded man of forty. He heard the chugging of the portable generator, and the distant clatter of the jackhammer cutting into the dense rock on the next hill. He saw the kids working around the jackhammer, moving away the big pieces of rock after checking them for fossils. At the foot of the hill, he saw the six tipis of his camp, the flapping mess tent, and the trailer that served as their field laboratory. And he saw Ellie waving to him, from the shadow of the field laboratory.\n \"Visitor!\" she called, and pointed to the east.\n Grant saw the cloud of dust, and the blue Ford sedan bouncing over the rutted road toward them. He glanced at his watch: right on time. On the other hill, the kids looked up with interest. They didn\u0027t get many visitors in Snakewater, and there had been a lot of speculation about what a lawyer from the Environmental Protection Agency would want to see Alan Grant about.\n But Grant knew that paleontology, the study of extinct life, had in recent years taken on an unexpected relevance to the modern world. The modem world was changing fast, and urgent questions about the weather, deforestation, global warming, or the ozone layer often seemed answerable, at least in part, with information from the past. Information that paleontologists could provide. He had been called as an expert witness twice in the past few years.\n Grant started down the hill to meet the car.\n The visitor coughed in the white dust as he slammed the car door. \"Bob Morris, EPA,\" he said, extending his hand. \"I\u0027m with the San Francisco office. \"\n Grant introduced himself and said, \"You look hot. Want a beer?\"\n \"Jesus, yeah.\" Morris was in his late twenties, wearing a tie, and pants from a business suit. He carried a briefcase. His wing-tip shoes crunched on the rocks as they walked toward the trailer.\n \"When I first came over the hill, I thought this was an Indian reservation,\" Morris said, pointing to the tipis.\n \"No,\" Grant said. \"Just the best way to live out here.\" Grant explained that in 1978, the first year of the excavations, they had come out in North Slope octahedral tents, the most advanced available. But the tents always blew over in the wind. They tried other kinds of tents, with the same result. Finally they started putting up tipis, which were larger inside, more comfortable, and more stable in wind. \"These\u0027re Blackfoot tipis, built around four poles,\" Grant said. \"Sioux tipis are built around three. But this used to be Blackfoot territory, so we thought . . .\"\n \"Uh-huh,\" Morris said. \"Very fitting.\" He squinted at the desolate landscape and shook his head. \"How long you been out here?\"\n \"About sixty cases,\" Grant said. When Morris looked surprised, he explained, \"We measure time in beer. We start in June with a hundred cases. We\u0027ve gone through about sixty so far.\"\n \"Sixty-three, to be exact,\" Ellie Sattler said, as they reached the trailer. Grant was amused to see Morris gaping at her. Ellie was wearing cut-off jeans and a workshirt tied at her midriff. She was twenty-four and darkly tanned. Her blond hair was pulled back.\n \"Ellie keeps us going,\" Grant said, introducing her. \"She\u0027s very good at what she does.\"\n \"What does she do?\" Morris asked.\n \"Paleobotany,\" Ellie said. \"And I also do the standard field preps.\" She opened the door and they went inside.\n The air conditioning in the trailer only brought the temperature down to eighty-five degrees, but it seemed cool after the midday beat. The trailer had a series of long wooden tables, with tiny bone specimens neatly laid out, tagged and labeled. Farther along were ceramic dishes and crocks. There was a strong odor of vinegar.\n Morris glanced at the bones. \"I thought dinosaurs were big,\" he said.\n \"They were,\" Ellie said. \"But everything you see here comes from babies. Snakewater is important primarily because of the number of dinosaur nesting sites here. Until we started this work, there were hardly any infant dinosaurs known. Only one nest had ever been found, in the Gobi Desert. We\u0027ve discovered a dozen different hadrosaur nests, complete with eggs and bones of infants.\"\n While Grant went to the refrigerator, she showed Morris the acetic acid baths, which were used to dissolve away the limestone from the delicate bones.\n \"They look like chicken bones,\" Morris said, peering into the ceramic dishes.\n \"Yes,\" she said. \"They\u0027re very bird-like.\"\n \"And what about those?\" Morris said, pointing through the trailer window to piles of large bones outside, wrapped in heavy plastic.\n \"Rejects,\" Ellie said. \"Bones too fragmentary when we took them out of the ground, In the old days we\u0027d just discard them, but nowadays we send them for genetic testing.\"\n \"Genetic testing?\" Morris said.\n \"Here you go,\" Grant said, thrusting a beer into his band. He gave another to Ellie. She chugged hers, throwing her long neck back. Morris stared.\n \"We\u0027re pretty informal here,\" Grant said. \"Want to step into my office?\"\n \"Sure,\" Morris said. Grant led him to the end of the trailer, where there was a torn couch, a sagging chair, and a battered endtable. Grant dropped onto the couch, which creaked and exhaled a cloud of chalky dust. He leaned back, thumped his boots up on the endtable, and gestured for Morris to sit in the chair. \"Make yourself comfortable.\"\n Grant was a professor of paleontology at the University of Denver, and one of the foremost researchers in his field, but he had never been comfortable with social niceties. He saw himself as an outdoor man, and he knew that all the important work in paleontology was done outdoors, with your bands. Grant had little patience for the academics, for the museum curators, for what he called Teacup Dinosaur Hunters. And he took some pains to distance himself in dress and behavior from the Teacup Dinosaur Hunters, even delivering his lectures in jeans and sneakers.\n Grant watched as Morris primly brushed off the seat of the chair before he sat down. Morris opened his briefcase, rummaged through his papers, and glanced back at Ellie, who was lifting bones with tweezers from the acid bath at the other end of the trailer, paying no attention to them. \"You\u0027re probably wondering why I\u0027m here.\"\n Grant nodded. \"It\u0027s a long way to come, Mr. Morris.\"\n \"Well,\" Morris said, \"to get right to the point, the EPA is concerned about the activities of the Hammond Foundation. You receive some funding from them.\"\n \"Thirty thousand dollars a year,\" Grant said, nodding. \"For the last five years.\"\n \"What do you know about the foundation?\" Morris said.\n Grant shrugged. \"The Hammond Foundation is a respected source of academic grants. They fund research all over the world, including several dinosaur researchers. I know they support Bob Kerry out of the Tyrrell in Alberta, and John Weller in Alaska. Probably more.\"\n \"Do you know why the Hammond Foundation supports so much dinosaur research?\" Morris asked.\n \"Of course. It\u0027s because old John Hammond is a dinosaur nut.\"\n \"You\u0027ve met Hammond?\"\n Grant shrugged. \"Once or twice. He comes here for brief visits. He\u0027s quite elderly, you know. And eccentric, the way rich people sometimes are. But always very enthusiastic. Why?\"\n \"Well,\" Morris said, \"the Hammond Foundation is actually a rather mysterious organization.\" He pulled out a Xeroxed world map, marked with red dots, and passed it to Grant. \"These are the digs the foundation financed last year. Notice anything odd about them? Montana, Alaska, Canada, Sweden . . . They\u0027re all sites in the north. There\u0027s nothing below the forty-fifth parallel.\" Morris pulled out more maps. \"It\u0027s the same, year after year. Dinosaur projects to the south, in Utah or Colorado or Mexico, never get funded. The Hammond Foundation only supports cold-weather digs. We\u0027d like to know why.\"\n Grant shuffled through the maps quickly. If it was true that the foundation only supported cold-weather digs, then it was strange behavior, because some of the best dinosaur researchers were working in hot climates, and -\n \"And there are other puzzles,\" Morris said. \"For example, what is the relationship of dinosaurs to amber?\"\n \"Amber?\"\n \"Yes. It\u0027s the hard yellow resin of dried tree sap-\"\n \"I know what it is,\" Grant said. \"But why are you asking?\"\n \"Because,\" Morris said, \"over the last five years, Hammond has purchased enormous quantities of amber in America, Europe, and Asia, including many pieces of museum-quality jewelry. The foundation has spent seventeen million dollars on amber. They now possess the largest privately held stock of this material in the world.\"\n \"I don\u0027t get it,\" Grant said.\n \"Neither does anybody else,\" Morris said. \"As far as we can tell, it doesn\u0027t make any sense at all. Amber is easily synthesized. It has no commercial or defense value. There\u0027s no reason to stockpile it. But Hammond has done just that, over many years.\"\n \"Amber,\" Grant said, shaking his head.\n \"And what about his island in Costa Rica?\" Morris continued. \"Ten years ago, the Hammond Foundation leased an island from the government of Costa Rica. Supposedly to set up a biological preserve.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know anything about that,\" Grant said, frowning.\n \"I haven\u0027t been able to find out much,\" Morris said. \"The island is a hundred miles off the west coast. It\u0027s very rugged, and it\u0027s in an area of ocean where the combinations of wind and current make it almost perpetually covered in fog. They used to call it Cloud Island. Isla Nublar. Apparently the Costa Ricans were amazed that anybody would want it.\" Morris searched in his briefcase. \"The reason I mention it,\" he said, \"is that, according to the records, you were paid a consultant\u0027s fee in connection with this island.\"\n \"I was?\" Grant said.\n Morris passed a sheet of paper to Grant. It was the Xerox of a check issued in March 1984 from InGen Inc., Farallon Road, Palo Alto, California. Made out to Alan Grant In the amount of twelve thousand dollars. At the lower corner, the check was marked CONSULTANT SERVICES/COSTA RICA/JUVENILE HYPERSPACE.\n \"Ob, sure,\" Grant said. \"I remember that. It was weird as hell, but I remember it. And it didn\u0027t have anything to do with an island.\"\n Alan Grant had found the first clutch of dinosaur eggs in Montana in 1979, and many more in the next two years, but he hadn\u0027t gotten around to publishing his findings until 1983. His paper, with its report of a herd of ten thousand duckbilled dinosaurs living along the shore of a vast inland sea, building communal nests of eggs in the mud, raising their infant dinosaurs in the herd, made Grant a celebrity overnight. The notion of maternal instincts in giant dinosaurs-and the drawings of cute babies poking their snouts out of the eggs-had appeal around the world. Grant was besieged with requests for interviews, lectures, books. Characteristically, he turned them all down, wanting only to continue his excavations. But it was during those frantic days of the mid-1980s that he was approached by the InGen corporation with a request for consulting services.\n \"Had you heard of InGen before?\" Morris asked. \"No.\"\n \"How did they contact you?\"\n \"Telephone call. It was a man named Gennaro or Gennino, something like that.\"\n Morris nodded. \"Donald Gennaro,\" he said. \"He\u0027s the legal counsel for InGen.\"\n \"Anyway, he wanted to know about eating habits of dinosaurs. And he offered me a fee to draw up a paper for him.\" Grant drank his beer, set the can on the floor. \"Gennaro was particularly interested in young dinosaurs. Infants and juveniles. What they ate. I guess he thought I would know about that.\"\n \"Did you?\"\n \"Not really, no. I told him that. We had found lots of skeletal material, but we had very little dietary data. But Gennaro said he knew we hadn\u0027t published everything, and he wanted whatever we had. And he offered a very large fee. Fifty thousand dollars.\"\n Morris took out a tape recorder and set it on the endtable. \"You mind?\"\n \"No, go ahead.\"\n \"So Gennaro telephoned you in 1984. What happened then?\"\n \"Well,\" Grant said. \"You see our operation here. Fifty thousand would support two full summers of digging. I told him I\u0027d do what I could.\"\n \"So you agreed to prepare a paper for him.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"On the dietary habits of juvenile dinosaurs?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"You met Gennaro?\"\n \"No. Just on the phone.\"\n \"Did Gennaro say why he wanted this information?\"\n \"Yes,\" Grant said. \"He was planning a museum for children, and he wanted to feature baby dinosaurs. He said he was hiring a number of academic consultants, and named them. There were paleontologists like me, and a mathematician from Texas named Ian Malcolm, and a couple of ecologists. A systems analyst. Good group.\"\n Morris nodded, making notes. \"So you accepted the consultancy?\"\n \"Yes. I agreed to send him a summary of our work: what we knew about the habits of the duckbilled hadrosaurs we\u0027d found.\"\n \"What kind of information did you send?\" Morris asked.\n \"Everything: nesting behavior, territorial ranges, feeding behavior, social behavior. Everything.\"\n \"And how did Gennaro respond?\"\n \"He kept calling and calling. Sometimes in the middle of the night. Would the dinosaurs eat this? Would they eat that? Should the exhibit include this? I could never understand why he was so worked up. I mean, I think dinosaurs are important, too, but not that important. They\u0027ve been dead sixty-five million years. You\u0027d think his calls could wait until morning.\"\n \"I see,\" Morris said. \"And the fifty thousand dollars?\"\n Grant shook his head. \"I got tired of Gennaro and called the whole thing off. We settled up for twelve thousand. That must have been about the middle of \u002785.\"\n Morris made a note. \"And InGen? Any other contact with them?\"\n \"Not since 1985.\"\n \"And when did the Hammond Foundation begin to fund your research?\"\n \"I\u0027d have to look,\" Grant said. \"But it was around then. Mid-eighties.\"\n \"And you know Hammond as just a rich dinosaur enthusiast.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n Morris made another note.\n \"Look,\" Grant said. \"If the EPA is so concerned about John Hammond and what he\u0027s doing-the dinosaur sites in the north, the amber purchases, the island in Costa Rica-why don\u0027t you \u0027ust ask him about it?\"\n \"At the moment, we can\u0027t,\" Morris said. \"Why not?\" Grant said.\n \"Because we don\u0027t have any evidence of wrongdoing,\" Morris said. \"But personally, I think it\u0027s clear John Hammond is evading the law.\"\n \"I was first contacted,\" Morris explained, \"by the Office of Technology Transfer. The OTT monitors shipments of American technology which might have military significance. They called to say that InGen had two areas of possible illegal technology transfer. First, InGen shipped three Cray XMPs to Costa Rica. InGen characterized it as transfer within corporate divisions, and said they weren\u0027t for resale. But OTT couldn\u0027t imagine why the hell somebody\u0027d need that power in Costa Rica.\"\n \"Three Crays,\" Grant said. \"is that a kind of computer?\"\n Morris nodded. \"Very powerful supercomputers. To put it in perspective, three Crays represent more computing power than any other privately held company in America. And InGen sent the machines to Costa Rica. You have to wonder why.\"\n \"I give up. Why?\" Grant said.\n \"Nobody knows. And the Hoods are even more worrisome,\" Morris continued. \"Hoods are automated gene sequencers-machines that work out the genetic code by themselves. They\u0027re so new that they haven\u0027t been put on the restricted lists yet. But any genetic engineering lab is likely to have one, if it can afford the half-million-dollar price tag.\" He flipped through his notes. \"Well, it seems InGen shipped twenty-four Hood sequencers to their island in Costa Rica.\n \"Again, they said it was a transfer within divisions and not an export,\" Morris said. \"There wasn\u0027t much that OTT could do. They\u0027re not officially concerned with use. But InGen was obviously setting up one of the most powerful genetic engineering facilities in the world in an obscure Central American country. A country with no regulations. That kind of thing has happened before.\"\n There had already been cases of American bioenginecring companies moving to another country so they would not be hampered by regulations and rules. The most flagrant, Morris explained, was the Biosyn rabies case.\n In 1986, Genetic Biosyn Corporation of Cupertino tested a bioengineered rabies vaccine on a farm in Chile. They didn\u0027t inform the government of Chile, or the farm workers involved. They simply released the vaccine.\n The vaccine consisted of live rabies virus, genetically modified to be nonvirulent. But the virulence hadn\u0027t been tested; Biosyn didn\u0027t know whether the virus could still cause rabies or not. Even worse, the virus had been modified. Ordinarily you couldn\u0027t contract rabies unless you were bitten by an animal. But Biosyn modified the rabies virus to cross the pulmonary alveoli; you could get an infection just inhaling it. Biosyn staffers brought this live rabies virus down to Chile in a carry-on bag on a commercial airline flight. Morris often wondered what would have happened if the capsule had broken open during the flight. Everybody on the plane might have been infected with rabies.\n It was outrageous. It was irresponsible. It was criminally negligent. But no action was taken against Biosyn. The Chilean farmers who unwittingly risked their lives were ignorant peasants; the government of Chile had an economic crisis to worry about; and the American authorities had no jurisdiction. So Lewis Dodgson, the geneticist responsible for the test, was still working at Biosyn. Biosyn was still as reckless as ever. And other American companies were hurrying to set up facilities in foreign countries that lacked sophistication about genetic research. Countries that perceived genetic engineering to be like any other high-tech development, and thus welcomed it to their lands, unaware of the dangers posed.\n \"So that\u0027s why we began our investigation of InGen,\" Morris said. \"About three weeks ago.\"\n \"And what have you actually found?\" Grant said.\n \"Not much,\" Morris admitted. \"When I go back to San Francisco, we\u0027ll probably have to close the investigation. And I think I\u0027m about finished here.\" He started packing up his briefcase- \"By the way, what does \u0027juvenile hyperspace\u0027 mean?\"\n \"That\u0027s just a fancy label for my report,\" Grant said. \" \u0027Hyperspace\u0027 is a term for multidimensional space-like three-dimensional tic-tac-toe. I you were to take all the behaviors of an animal, its eating and movement and sleeping, you could plot the animal within the multidimensional space. Some paleontologists refer to the behavior of an animal as occurring in an ecological hyperspace. \u0027Juvenile hyperspace\u0027 would just refer to the behavior of juvenile dinosaurs-if you wanted to be as pretentious as possible.\"\n At the far end of the trailer, the phone rang. Ellie answered it. She said, \"He\u0027s in a meeting right now. Can he call you back?\"\n Morris snapped his briefcase shut and stood. \"Thanks for your help and the beer,\" he said.\n \"No problem,\" Grant said.\n Grant walked with Morris down the trailer to the door at the far end. Morris said, \"Did Hammond ever ask for any physical materials from your site? Bones, or eggs, or anything like that?\"\n \"No,\" Grant said.\n \"Dr. Sattler mentioned you do some genetic work here. . . .\"\n \"Well, not exactly,\" Grant said. \"When we remove fossils that are broken or for some other reason not suitable for museum preservation, we send the bones out to a lab that grinds them up and tries to extract proteins for us, The proteins are then identified and the report is sent back to us.\"\n \"Which lab is that?\" Morris asked.\n \"Medical Biologic Services in Salt Lake.\"\n \"How\u0027d you choose them?\"\n \"Competitive bids.\"\n \"The lab has nothing to do with InGen?\" Morris asked.\n \"Not that I know,\" Grant said.\n They came to the door of the trailer. Grant opened it, and felt the rush of hot air from outside. Morris paused to put on his sunglasses.\n \"One last thing,\" Morris said. \"Suppose InGen wasn\u0027t really making a museum exhibit. Is there anything else they could have done with the information in the report you gave them?\"\n Grant laughed. \"Sure. They could feed a baby hadrosaur.\"\n Morris laughed, too. \"A baby hadrosaur. That\u0027d be something to see. How big were they?\"\n \"About so,\" Grant said, holding his hands six inches apart. \"Squirrelsize.\"\n \"And how long before they become full-grown?\"\n \"Three years,\" Grant said. \"Give or take.\"\n Morris held out his band. \"Well, thanks again for your help.\"\n \"Take it easy driving back,\" Grant said. He watched for a moment as Morris walked back toward his car, and then closed the trailer door.\n Grant said, \"What did you think?\"\n Ellie shrugged. \"Na?ve.\"\n \"You like the part where John Hammond is the evil arch-villain?\" Grant laughed. \"John Hammond\u0027s about as sinister as Walt Disney. By the way, who called?\"\n \"Oh,\" Ellie said, \"it was a woman named Alice Levin. She works at Columbia Medical Center. You know her?\"\n Grant shook his head. \"No.\"\n \"Well, it was something about identifying some remains. She wants you to call her back right away.\"\n Skeleton\n Ellie Sattler brushed a strand of blond hair back from her face and turned her attention to the acid baths. She had six in a row, at molar strengths from 5 to 30 percent. She \u0027had to keep an eye on the stronger solutions, because they would eat through the limestone and begin to erode the bones. And infant-dinosaur bones were so fragile, She marveled that they had been preserved at all, after eighty million years.\n She listened idly as Grant said, \"Miss Levin? This is Alan Grant. What\u0027s this about a . . . You have what? A what?\" He began to laugh. \"Oh, I doubt that very much, Miss Levin. . . . No, I really don\u0027t have time, I\u0027m sorry . . . . Well, I\u0027d take a look at it, but I can pretty much guarantee it\u0027s a basilisk lizard. But . . . yes, you can do that. All right. Send it now.\" Grant hung up, and shook his head. \"These people.\"\n Ellie said, \"What\u0027s it about?\"\n \"Some lizard she\u0027s trying to identify,\" Grant said. \"She\u0027s going to fax me an X-ray.\" He walked over to the fax and waited as the transmission came through. \"Incidentally, I\u0027ve got a new find for you. A good one.\"\n \"Yes?\"\n Grant nodded. \"Found it just before the kid showed up. On South Hill, horizon four. Infant velociraptor: jaw and complete dentition, so there\u0027s no question about identity. And the site looks undisturbed. We might even get a full skeleton.\"\n \"That\u0027s fantastic,\" Ellie said. \"How young?\"\n \"Young,\" Grant said. \"Two, maybe four months at most.\"\n \"And it\u0027s definitely a velociraptor?\"\n \"Definitely,\" Grant said. \"Maybe our luck has finally turned.\"\n For the last two years at Snakewater, the team had excavated only duckbilled hadrosaurs. They already had evidence for vast herds of these grazing dinosaurs, roaming the Cretaceous plains in groups of ten or twenty thousand, as buffalo would later roam.\n But increasingly the question that faced them was: where were the predators?\n They expected predators to be rare, of course. Studies of predator/prey populations in the game parks of Africa and India suggested that, roughly speaking, there was one predatory carnivore for every four hundred herbivores. That meant a herd of ten thousand duckbills would support only twenty-five tyrannosaurs. So it was unlikely that they would find the remains of a large predator.\n But where were the smaller predators? Snakewater had dozens of nesting sites-in some places, the ground was literally covered with fragments of dinosaur eggshells-and many small dinosaurs ate eggs. Animals like Dromaeosaurus, Oviraptor, Velociraptor, and Coelurus-predators three to six feet tall-must have been found here in abundance.\n But they had discovered none so far.\n Perhaps this velociraptor skeleton did mean their luck had changed. And an infant! Ellie knew that one of Grant\u0027s dreams was to study infant-rearing behavior in carnivorous dinosaurs, as he had already studied the behavior of herbivores. Perhaps this was the first step toward that dream. \"You must be pretty excited,\" Ellie said.\n Grant didn\u0027t answer.\n \"I said, you must be excited,\" Ellie repeated.\n \"My God,\" Grant said. He was staring at the fax.\n Ellie looked over Grant\u0027s shoulder at the X-ray, and breathed out slowly. \"You think it\u0027s an amassicus?\"\n \"Yes,\" Grant said. \"Or a triassicus. The skeleton is so light.\"\n \"But it\u0027s no lizard,\" she said.\n \"No,\" Grant said. \"This is not a lizard. No three-toed lizard has walked on this planet for two hundred million years.\"\n Ellie\u0027s first thought was that she was looking at a hoax-an ingenious, skillful hoax, but a hoax nonetheless. Every biologist knew that the threat of a hoax was omnipresent. The most famous hoax, the Piltdown man, had gone undetected for forty years, and its perpetrator was still unknown. More recently, the distinguished astronomer Fred Hoyle had claimed that a fossil winged dinosaur, Archaeopteryx, on display in the British Museum, was a fraud. (It was later shown to be genuine.)\n The essence of a successful hoax was that it presented scientists with what they expected to see. And, to Ellie\u0027s eye, the X-ray image of the lizard was exactly correct. The three-toed foot was well balanced, with the medial claw smallest. The bony remnants of the fourth and fifth toes were located up near the metatarsal joint. The tibia was strong, and considerably longer than the femur. At the hip, the acetabulum was complete. The tail showed forty-five vertebrae. It was a Procompsognathus.\n \"Could this X-ray be faked?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Grant said. \"But it\u0027s almost impossible to fake an X-ray. And Procompsognathus is an obscure animal. Even people familiar with dinosaurs have never heard of it.\"\n Ellie read the note. \"Specimen acquired on the beach of Cabo Blanco, July 16. . . . Apparently a howler monkey was eating the animal, and this was all that was recovered. Oh . . . and it says the lizard attacked a little girl.\"\n \"I doubt that,\" Grant said. \"But perhaps. Procompsognathus was so small and light we assume it must be a scavenger, only feeding off dead creatures. And you can tell the size\"-he measured quickly-\"it\u0027s about twenty centimeters to the hips, which means the full animal would be about a foot tall. About as big as a chicken. Even a child would look pretty fearsome to it. It might bite an infant, but not a child.\"\n Ellie frowned at the X-ray image. \"You think this could really be a legitimate rediscovery?\" she said. \"Like the coelacanth?\"\n \"Maybe,\" Grant said. The coelacanth was a five-foot-long fish thought to have died out sixty-five million years ago, until a specimen was pulled from the ocean in 1938. But there were other examples. The Australian mountain pygmy possum was known only from fossils until a live one was found in a garbage can in Melbourne. And a ten-thousand-year-old fossil fruit bat from New Guinea was described by a zoologist who not long afterward received a living specimen in the mail.\n \"But could it be real?\" she persisted. \"What about the age?\"\n Grant nodded. \"The age is a problem.\"\n Most rediscovered animals were rather recent additions to the fossil record: ten or twenty thousand years old. Some were a few million years old- in the case of the coelacanth, sixty-five million years old. But the specimen they were looking at was much, much older than that. Dinosaurs had died out in the Cretaceous period, sixty-five million years ago. They had flourished as the dominant life form on the planet in the Jurassic, 190 million years ago. And they had first appeared in the Triassic, roughly 220 million years ago.\n It was during the early Triassic period that Procompsognathus had lived-a time so distant that our planet didn\u0027t even look the same. All the continents were joined together in a single landmass, called Pangaca, which extended from the North to the South Pole-a vast continent of ferns and forests, with a few large deserts. The Atlantic Ocean was a narrow lake between what would become Africa and Florida. The air was denser. The land was warmer. There were hundreds of active volcanoes. And it was in this environment that Procompsognathus lived.\n \"Well,\" Ellie said. \"We know animals have survived. Crocodiles are basically Triassic animals living in the present. Sharks are Triassic. So we know it has happened before.\"\n Grant nodded. \"And the thing is,\" he said, \"how else do we explain it? It\u0027s either a fake-which I doubt-or else it\u0027s a rediscovery. What else could it be?\"\n The phone rang. \"Alice Levin again,\" Grant said. \"Let\u0027s see if she\u0027ll send us the actual specimen.\" He answered it and looked at Ellie, surprised. \"Yes, I\u0027ll hold for Mr. Hammond. Yes. Of course.\"\n \"Hammond? What does he want?\" Ellie said.\n Grant shook his head, and then said into the phone, \"Yes, Mr. Hammond. Yes, it\u0027s good to hear your voice, too. . . .Yes . . . .\" He looked at Ellie. \"Oh, you did? Oh yes? Is that right?\"\n He cupped his hand over the mouthpiece and said, \"Still as eccentric as ever. You\u0027ve got to hear this.\"\n Grant pushed the speaker button, and Ellie heard a raspy old-man\u0027s voice speaking rapidly: \"-hell of an annoyance from some EPA fellow, seems to have gone off half cocked, all on his own, running around the country talking to people, stirring up things. I don\u0027t suppose anybody\u0027s come to see you way out there?\"\n \"As a matter of fact,\" Grant said, \"somebody did come to see me.\"\n Hammond snorted. \"I was afraid of that. Smart-ass kid named Morris?\"\n \"Yes, his name was Morris,\" Grant said.\n \"He\u0027s going to see all our consultants,\" Hammond said. \"He went to see Ian Malcolm the other day-you know, the mathematician in Texas? That\u0027s the first I knew of it. We\u0027re having one hell of a time getting a handle on this thing, it\u0027s typical of the way government operates, there isn\u0027t any complaint, there isn\u0027t any charge, just harassment from some kid who\u0027s unsupervised and is running around at the taxpayers\u0027 expense. Did he bother you? Disrupt your work?\"\n \"No, no, he didn\u0027t bother me.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s too bad, in a way,\" Hammond said, \"because I\u0027d try and get an injunction to stop him if he had. As it is, I had our lawyers call over at EPA to find out what the hell their problem is. The head of the office claims he didn\u0027t know there was any investigation! You figure that one out. Damned bureaucracy is all it is. Hell, I think this kid\u0027s trying to get down to Costa Rica, poke around, get onto our island. You know we have an island down there?\"\n \"No,\" Grant said, looking at Ellie, \"I didn\u0027t know.\"\n \"Oh yes, we bought it and started our operation oh, four or five years ago now. I forget exactly. Called Isla Nublar-big island, hundred miles offshore. Going to be a biological preserve. Wonderful place. Tropical jungle. You know, you ought to see it, Dr. Grant.\"\n \"Sounds interesting,\" Grant said, \"but actually-\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jurassic-park-jurassic-park-1/page-4.html","bookId":1711,"book":{"id":1711,"title":"Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1) \n An astonishing technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA has been discovered.
