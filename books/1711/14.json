Don\u0027t Worry.\" He clicked the radio off.\n Ed Regis snorted. \"It\u0027s pouring down rain. Of course we\u0027ll stay in the car,\" he muttered.\n Tim turned to look at the foliage at the side of the road. Through the goggles, the foliage was a bright electronic green, and beyond he could see sections of the green grid pattern of the fence. The Land Cruisers were stopped on the downslope of a hill, which must mean they were someplace near the tyrannosaur area. It would be amazing to see a tyrannosaur with these night-vision goggles. A real thrill. Maybe the tyrannosaur would come to the fence and look over at them. Tim wondered if its eyes would glow in the dark when he saw them. That would be neat.\n But he didn\u0027t see anything, and eventually he stopped looking. Everyone in the cars fell silent. The rain thrummed on the roof of the car. Sheets of water streamed down over the sides of the windows. It was hard for Tim to see out, even with the goggles.\n \"How long have we been sitting here?\" Malcolm asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know. Four or five minutes.\"\n \"I wonder what the problem is.\"\n \"Maybe a short circuit from the rain.\"\n \"But it happened before the rain really started.\"\n There was another silence. In a tense voice, Lex said, \"But there\u0027s no lightning, right?\" She had always been afraid of lightning, and she now sat nervously squeezing her leather mitt in her hands.\n Dr. Grant said, \"What was that? We didn\u0027t quite read that.\"\n \"Just my sister talking.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n Tim again scanned the foliage, but saw nothing. Certainly nothing as big as a tyrannosaur. He began to wonder if the tyrannosaurs came out at night. Were they nocturnal animals? Tim wasn\u0027t sure if he had ever read that. He had the feeling that tyrannosaurs were all-weather, day or night animals. The time of day didn\u0027t matter to a tyrannosaur.\n The rain continued to pour.\n \"Hell of a rain,\" Ed Regis said. \"It\u0027s really coming down.\"\n Lex said, \"I\u0027m hungry.\"\n \"I know that, Lex,\" Regis said, \"but we\u0027re stuck here, sweetie. The cars run on electricity in buried cables in the road.\"\n \"Stuck for how long?\"\n \"Until they fix the electricity.\"\n Listening to the sound of the rain, Tim felt himself growing sleepy. He yawned, and turned to look at the palm trees on the left side of the road, and was startled by a sudden tbump as the ground shook. He swung back just in time to catch a glimpse of a dark shape as it swiftly crossed the road between the two cars.\n \"Jesus! \"\n \"What was it?\"\n \"It was huge, it was big as the car-\"\n \"Tim! Are you there?\"\n He picked up the radio. \"Yes, I\u0027m here.\"\n \"Did you see it, Tim?\"\n \"No,\" Tim said. \"I missed it.\"\n \"What the hell was it?\" Malcolm said.\n \"Are you wearing the night-vision goggles, Tim?\"\n \"Yes. I\u0027ll watch,\" Tim said.\n \"Was it the tyrannosaur?\" Ed Regis asked.\n \"I don\u0027t think so. It was in the road.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t see it?\" Ed Regis said.\n \"No. \"\n Tim felt had that he had missed seeing the animal whatever it was.\n There was a sudden white crack of lightning, and his night goggles flared bright green. He blinked his eyes and started counting. \"One one thousand . . . two one thousand . . .\"\n The thunder crashed, deafeningly loud and very close. Lex began to cry. \"Oh, no . . .\"\n \"Take it easy, honey,\" Ed Regis said. \"It\u0027s just lightning.\"\n Tim scanned the side of the road. The rain was coming down bard now, shaking the leaves with hammering drops. It made everything move. Everything seemed alive. He scanned the leaves. . . .\n He stopped. There was something beyond the leaves.\n Tim looked up, higher.\n Behind the foliage, beyond the fence, he saw a thick body with a pebbled, grainy surface like the bark of a tree. But it wasn\u0027t a tree. He continued to look higher, sweeping the goggles upward-\n He saw the huge head of the tyrannosaurus. Just standing there, looking over the fence at the two Land Cruisers. The lightning flashed again, and the big animal rolled its head and bellowed in the glaring light. Then darkness, and silence again, and the pounding rain.\n \"Tim?\"\n \"Yes, Dr. Grant.\"\n \"You see what it is?\"\n \"Yes, Dr. Grant.\"\n Tim had the sense that Dr. Grant was trying to talk in a way that wouldn\u0027t upset his sister.\n \"What\u0027s going on right now?\"\n \"Nothing,\" Tim said, watching the tyrannosaur through his night goggles. \"Just standing on the other side of the fence.\"\n \"I can\u0027t see much from here, Tim.\"\n \"I can see fine, Dr. Grant. It\u0027s just standing there.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n Lex continued to cry, snuffling.\n There was another pause. Tim watched the tyrannosaur. The head was huge! The animal looked from one vehicle to another. Then back again. It seemed to stare right at Tim.\n In the goggles, the eyes glowed bright green.\n Tim felt a chill, but then, as he looked down the animal\u0027s body, moving down from the massive head and jaws, he saw the smaller, muscular forelimb. It waved in the air and then it gripped the fence.\n \"Jesus Christ,\" Ed Regis said, staring out the window.\n The greatest preditor the world has ever known. The most fearsome attack in human history. Somewhere in the back of his publicist\u0027s brain, Ed Regis was still writing copy. But he could feel his knees begin to shake uncontrollably, his trousers flapping like flags, Jesus, he was frightened. He didn\u0027t want to be here. Alone among all the people in the two cars, Ed Regis knew what a dinosaur attack was like. He knew what happened to people. He had seen the mangled bodies that resulted from a raptor attack. He could picture it in his mind. And this was a rex! Much, much bigger! The greatest meat-eater that ever walked the earth!\n Jesus.\n When the tyrannosaur roared it was terrifying, a scream from some other world. Ed Regis felt the spreading warmth in his trousers. He\u0027d peed in his pants. He was simultaneously embarrassed and terrified. But he knew he had to do something. He couldn\u0027t just stay here. He had to do something. Something. His hands were shaking, trembling against the dash.\n \"Jesus Christ,\" he said again.\n \"Bad language,\" Lex said, wagging her finger at him.\n Tim heard the sound of a door opening, and he swung his head away from the tyrannosaur-the night-vision goggles streaked laterally-in time to see Ed Regis stepping out through the open door, ducking his head in the rain.\n \"Hey,\" Lex said, \"where are you going?\"\n Ed Regis just turned and ran in the opposite direction from the tyrannosaur, disappearing into the woods. The door to the Land Cruiser hung open; the paneling was getting wet.\n \"He left!\" Lex said. \"Where did he go? He left us alone!\"\n \"Shut the door,\" Tim said, but she had started to scream, \"He left us! He left us!\"\n \"Tim, what\u0027s going on?\" It was Dr. Grant, on the radio. \"Tim?\"\n Tim leaned forward and tried to shut the door. From the back seat, he couldn\u0027t reach the handle. He looked back at the tyrannosaur as lightning flashed again, momentarily silhouetting the huge black shape against the white-flaring sky.\n \"Tim, what\u0027s happening?\"\n \"He left us, he left us!\"\n Tim blinked to recover his vision. When he looked again, the tyrannosaur was standing there, exactly as before, motionless and huge. Rain dripped from its jaws. The forelimb gripped the fence. . . .\n And then Tim realized: the tyrannosaur was holding on to the fence! The fence wasn\u0027t electrified any more!\n \"Lex, close the door!\"\n The radio crackled. \"Tim!\"\n \"I\u0027m here, Dr. Grant.\"\n \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n \"Regis ran away,\" Tim said.\n \"He what?\"\n \"He ran away. I think he saw that the fence isn\u0027t electrified,\" Tim said.\n \"The fence isn\u0027t electrified?\" Malcolm said, over the radio. \"Did he say the fence isn\u0027t electrified?\"\n \"Lex,\" Tim said, \"close the door. \" But Lex was screaming, \"He left us, he left us!\" in a steady, monotonous wail, and there was nothing for Tim to do but climb out of the back door, into the slashing rain, and shut the door for her. Thunder rumbled, and the lightning flashed again. Tim looked up and saw the tyrannosaur crashing down the cyclone fence with a giant hind limb.\n \"Timmy!\"\n He jumped back in and slammed the door, the sound lost in the tbunderclap.\n The radio: \"Tim! Are you there?\"\n He grabbed the radio. \"I\u0027m here.\" He turned to Lex. \"Lock the doors. Get in the middle of the car. And shut up.\"\n Outside, the tyrannosaur rolled its head and took an awkward step forward. The claws of its feet had caught in the grid of the flattened fence. Lex saw the animal finally, and became silent, still. She watched with wide eyes.\n Radio crackle. \"Tim.\"\n \"Yes, Dr. Grant.\"\n \"Stay in the car. Stay down. Be quiet. Don\u0027t move, and don\u0027t make noise.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"You should be all right. I don\u0027t think it can open the car.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"Just stay quiet, so you don\u0027t arouse its attention any more than necessary.\n \"Okay.\" Tim clicked the radio off. \"You hear that, Lex?\" His sister nodded, silently. She never took her eyes off the dinosaur. The tyrannosaur roared. In the glare of lightning, they saw it pull free of the fence and take a bounding step forward.\n Now it was standing between the two cars. Tim couldn\u0027t see Dr. Grant\u0027s car any more, because the huge body blocked his view. The rain ran in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the muscular hind legs. He couldn\u0027t see the animal\u0027s head, which was high above the roofline.\n The tyrannosaur moved around the side of their car. It went to the very spot where Tim had gotten out of the car. Where Ed Regis had gotten out of the car. The animal paused there. The big head ducked down, toward the mud.\n Tim looked back at Dr. Grant and Dr. Malcolm in the rear car. Their faces were tense as they stared forward through the windshield.\n The huge head raised back up, jaws open, and then stopped by the side windows. In the glare of lightning, they saw the beady, expressionless reptile eye moving in the socket.\n It was looking in the car.\n His sister\u0027s breath came in ragged, frightened gasps. He reached out and squeezed her arm, hoping she would stay quiet. The dinosaur continued to stare for a long time through the side window. Perhaps the dinosaur couldn\u0027t really see them, he thought. Finally the head lifted up, out of view again.\n \"Timmy . . .\" Lex whispered.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" Tim whispered. \"I don\u0027t think it saw us.\"\n He was looking back toward Dr. Grant when a jolting impact rocked the Land Cruiser and shattered the windshield in a spiderweb as the tyrannosaur\u0027s head crashed against the hood of the Land Cruiser. Tim was knocked flat on the seat. The night-vision goggles slid off his forehead.\n He got back up quickly, blinking in the darkness, his mouth warm with blood.\n \"Lex?\"\n He couldn\u0027t see his sister anywhere.\n The tyrannosaur stood near the front of the Land Cruiser, its chest moving as it breathed, the forelimbs making clawing movements in the air.\n \"Lex!\" Tim whispered. Then he heard her groan. She was lying somewhere on the floor under the front seat.\n Then the huge head came down, entirely blocking the shattered windshield. The tyrannosaur banged again on the front hood of the Land Cruiser. Tim grabbed the seat as the car rocked on its wheels. The tyrannosaur banged down twice more, denting the metal.\n Then it moved around the side of the car. The big raised tail blocked his view out of all the side windows. At the back, the animal snorted, a deep rumbling growl that blended with the thunder. It sank its jaws into the spare tire mounted on the back of the Land Cruiser and, in a single head shake, tore it away. The rear of the car lifted into the air for a moment; then it thumped down with a muddy splash.\n \"Tim!\" Dr. Grant said. \"Tim, are you there?\"\n Tim grabbed the radio. \"We\u0027re okay,\" he said. There was a shrill metallic scrape as claws raked the roof of the car. Tim\u0027s heart was pounding in his chest. He couldn\u0027t see anything out of the windows on the right side except pebbled leathery flesh. The tyrannosaur was leaning against the car, which rocked back and forth with each breath, the springs and metal creaking loudly.\n Lex groaned again. Tim put down the radio, and started to crawl over into the front seat. The tyrannosaur roared and the metal roof dented downward. Tim felt a sharp pain in his head and tumbled to the floor, onto the transmission bump. He found himself lying alongside Lex, and he was shocked to see that the whole side of her head was covered in blood. She looked unconscious.\n There was another jolting impact, and pieces of glass fell all around him. Tim felt rain. He looked up and saw that the front windshield had broken out. There was just a jagged rim of glass and, beyond, the big head of the dinosaur.\n Looking down at him.\n Tim felt a sudden chill and then the head rushed forward toward him, the jaws open. There was the squeal of metal against teeth, and he felt the hot stinking breath of the animal and a thick tongue stuck into the car through the windshield opening. The tongue slapped wetly around inside the car-he felt the hot lather of dinosaur saliva-and the tyrannosaur roared-a deafening sound inside the car-\n The head pulled away abruptly.\n Tim scrambled up, avoiding the dent in the roof. There was still room to sit on the front seat by the passenger door. The tyrannosaur stood in the rain near the front fender. It seemed confused by what had happened to it. Blood dripped freely from its jaws.\n The tyrannosaur looked at Tim, cocking its head to stare with one big eye. The head moved close to the car, sideways, and peered in. Blood spattered on the dented bood of the Land Cruiser, mixing with the rain.\n It can\u0027t get to me, Tim thought. It\u0027s too big.\n Then the head pulled away, and in the flare of lightning he saw the hind leg lift up. And the world tilted crazily as the Land Cruiser slammed over its side, the windows splatting in the mud. He saw Lex fall helplessly against the side window, and he fell down beside her, banging his head. Tim felt dizzy. Then the tyrannosaur\u0027s jaws clamped onto the window frame, and the whole Land Cruiser was lifted up into the air, and shaken.\n \"Timmy!\" Lex shrieked, so near to his ear that it hurt. She was suddenly awake, and he grabbed her as the tyrannosaur crashed the car down again. Tim felt a stabbing pain in his side, and his sister fell on top of him. The car went up again, tilting crazily. Lex shouted \"Timmy!\" and he saw the door give way beneath her, and she fell out of the car into the mud but Tim couldn\u0027t answer, because in the next instant everything swung crazily-he saw the trunks of the palm trees sliding downward past him-moving sideways through the air-he glimpsed the ground very far below-the hot roar of the tyrannosaur-the blazing eye-the tops of the palm trees-\n And then, with a metallic scraping shriek, the car fell from the tyrannosaur\u0027s jaws, a sickening fall, and Tim\u0027s stomach heaved in the moment before the world became totally black, and silent.\n In the other car, Malcolm gasped. \"Jesus! What happened to the car?\" Grant blinked his eyes as the lightning faded.\n The other car was gone.\n Grant couldn\u0027t believe it. He peered forward, trying to see through the rain-streaked windshield. The dinosaur\u0027s body was so large, it was probably just blocking-\n No. In another flash of lightning, he saw clearly: the car was gone.\n \"What happened?\" Malcolm said.\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n Faintly, over the rain, Grant heard the sound of the little girl screaming. The dinosaur was standing in darkness on the road up ahead, but they could see well enough to know that it was bending over now, sniffing the ground.\n Or eating something on the ground.\n \"Can you see?\" Malcolm said, squinting.\n \"Not much, no,\" Grant said. The rain pounded on the roof of the car. He listened for the little girl, but he didn\u0027t hear her any more. The two men sat in the car, listening.\n \"Was it the girl?\" Malcolm said, finally. \"It sounded like the girl.\"\n \"It did, yes.\"\n \"Was it?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Grant said. He felt a seeping fatigue overtake him. Blurred through the rainy windshield, the dinosaur was coming toward their car. Slow, ominous strides, coming right toward them.\n Malcolm said, \"You know, at times like this one feels, well, perhaps extinct animals should be left extinct. Don\u0027t you have that feeling now?\"\n \"Yes,\" Grant said. He was feeling his heart pounding.\n \"Umm. Do you, ah, have any suggestions about what we do now?\"\n \"I can\u0027t think of a thing,\" Grant said.\n Malcolm twisted the handle, kicked open the door, and ran. But even as he did, Grant could see he was too late, the tyrannosaur too close. There was another crack of lightning, and in that instant of glaring white light, Grant watched in horror as the tyrannosaur roared, and leapt forward.\n Grant was not clear about exactly what happened next. Malcolm was running, his feet splashing in the mud. The tyrannosaur bounded alongside him and ducked its massive head, and Malcolm was tossed into the air like a small doll.\n By then Grant was out of the car, too, feeling the cold rain slashing his face and body. The tyrannosaur had turned its back to him, the huge tail swinging through the air. Grant was tensing to run for the woods when suddenly the tyrannosaur spun back to face him, and roared.\n Grant froze.\n He was standing beside the passenger door of the Land Cruiser, drenched in rain. He was completely exposed, the tyrannosaur no more than eight feet away. The big animal roared again. At so close a range the sound was terrifyingly loud. Grant felt himself shaking with cold and fright. He pressed his trembling hands against the metal of the door panel to steady them.\n The tyrannosaur roared once more, but it did not attack. It cocked its head, and looked with first one eye, then the other, at the Land Cruiser. And it did nothing.\n It just stood there.\n What was going on?\n The powerful jaws opened and closed. The tyrannosaur bellowed angrily, and then the big hind leg came up and crashed down on the roof of the car; the claws slid off with a metal screech, barely missing Grant as he stood there, still unmoving.\n The foot splashed in the mud. The head ducked down in a slow arc, and the animal inspected the car, snorting. It peered into the front windshield. Then, moving toward the rear, it banged the passenger door shut, and moved right toward Grant as he stood there. Grant was dizzy with fear his heart pounding inside his chest. With the animal so close, he could smell the rotten flesh in the mouth, the sweetish blood-smell, the sickening stench of the carnivore. . . .\n He tensed his body, awaiting the inevitable.\n The big head slid past him, toward the rear of the car. Grant blinked.\n What had happened?\n Was it possible the tyrannosaur hadn\u0027t seen him? It seemed as if it hadn\u0027t. But how could that be? Grant looked back to see the animal sniffing the rear-mounted tire. It nudged the tire with its snout, and then the head swung back. Again it approached Grant.\n This time the animal stopped, the black flaying nostrils just inches away. Grant felt the animal\u0027s startling hot breath on his face. But the tyrannosaur wasn\u0027t sniffing like a dog. It was just breathing, and if anything it seemed puzzled.\n No, the tyrannosaur couldn\u0027t see him. Not if he stood motionless. And in a detached academic corner of his mind he found an explanation for that, a reason why-\n The laws opened before him, the massive head raised up. Grant squeezed his fists together, and bit his lip, trying desperately to remain motionless, to make no sound.\n The tyrannosaur bellowed in the night air.\n But by now Grant was beginning to understand. The animal couldn\u0027t see him, but it suspected he was there, somewhere, and was trying with its bellowing to frighten Grant into some revealing movement. So long as he stood his ground, Grant realized, he was invisible.\n In a final gesture of frustration, the big hind leg lifted up and kicked the Land Cruiser over, and Grant felt searing pain and the surprising sensation of his own body flying through the air. It seemed to be happening very slowly, and he had plenty of time to feel the world turn colder, and watch the ground rush up to strike him in the face.\n Return\n \"Oh damn,\" Harding said. \"Will you look at that.\"\n They were sitting in Harding\u0027s gasoline-powered Jeep, staring forward past the flick flick of the windshield wipers. In the yellow flare of the headlamps, a big fallen tree blocked the road.\n \"Must have been the lightning,\" Gennaro said. \"Hell of a tree.\"\n \"We can\u0027t get past it,\" Harding said. \"I better tell Arnold in control.\" He picked up the radio and twisted the channel dial. \"Hello, John. Are you there, John?\"\n There was nothing but steady hissing static. \"I don\u0027t understand,\" he said. \"The radio lines seem to be down.\"\n \"It must be the storm,\" Gennaro said.\n \"I suppose,\" Harding said.\n \"Try the Land Cruisers,\" Ellie said.\n Harding opened the other channels, but there was no answer.\n \"Nothing,\" he said. \"They\u0027re probably back to camp by now, and outside the range of our little set. In any case, I don\u0027t think we should stay here. It\u0027ll be hours before Maintenance gets a crew out here to move that tree.\"\n He turned the radio off, and put the Jeep into reverse.\n \"Wbat\u0027re you going to do?\" Ellie said.\n \"Go back to the turnout, and get onto the maintenance road. Fortunately there\u0027s a second road system,\" Harding explained. \"We have one road for visitors, and a second road for animal handlers and feed trucks and so on. We\u0027ll drive back on that maintenance road. It\u0027s a little longer. And not so scenic. But you may find it interesting. If the rain lets up, we\u0027ll get a glimpse of some of the animals at night. We should be back in thirty, forty minutes,\" Harding said. \"If I don\u0027t get lost.\"\n He turned the Jeep around in the night, and headed south again.\n Lightning flashed, and every monitor in the control room went black.\n Arnold sat forward, his body rigid and tense. Jesus, not now. Not now. That was all he needed-to have everything go out now in the storm. All the main power circuits were surge-protected, of course, but Arnold wasn\u0027t sure about the modems Nedry was using for his data transmission. Most people didn\u0027t know it was possible to blow an entire system through a modem-the lightning pulse climbed back into the computer through the telephone line, and-bang!-no more motherboard. No more RAM. No more file server. No more computer.\n The screens flickered. And then, one by one, they came back on.\n Arnold sighed, and collapsed back in his chair.\n He wondered again where Nedry had gone. Five minutes ago, he\u0027d sent guards to search the building for him. The fat bastard was probably in the bathroom reading a comic book. But the guards hadn\u0027t come back, and they hadn\u0027t called in.\n Five minutes. If Nedry was in the building, they should have found him by now.\n \"Somebody took the damned Jeep,\" Muldoon said as he came back in the room. \"Have you talked to the Land Cruisers yet?\"\n \"Can\u0027t raise them on the radio,\" Arnold said. \"I have to use this, because the main board is down. It\u0027s weak, but it ought to work. I\u0027ve tried on all six channels. I know they have radios in the cars, but they\u0027re not answering.\"\n \"That\u0027s not good,\" Muldoon said.\n \"If you want to go out there, take one of the maintenance vehicles.\"\n \"I would,\" Muldoon said, \"but they\u0027re all in the east garage, more than a mile from here. Where\u0027s Harding?\"\n \"I assume he\u0027s on his way back.\"\n \"Then he\u0027ll pick up the people in the Land Cruisers on his way.\"\n \"I assume so.\"\n \"Anybody tell Hammond the kids aren\u0027t back yet?\"\n \"Hell no,\" Arnold said. \"I don\u0027t want that son of a bitch running around here, screaming at me. Everytbing\u0027s all right, for the moment. The Land Cruisers are just stuck in the rain. They can sit a while, until Harding brings them back. Or until we find Nedry, and make that little bastard turn the systems back on.\"\n \"You can\u0027t get them back on?\" Muldoon said.\n Arnold shook his head. \"I\u0027ve been trying. But Nedry\u0027s done something to the system. I can\u0027t figure out what, but if I have to go into the code itself, that\u0027ll take hours. We need Nedry. We\u0027ve got to find the son of a bitch right away.\"\n Nedry \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jurassic-park-jurassic-park-1/page-14.html","bookId":1711,"book":{"id":1711,"title":"Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1) \n An astonishing technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA has been discovered.
