{"id":66881,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\"It could only have been after the attack,\" Muldoon said. \"The kid must have been in this car, after the attack. And the radio was broken, so he left it behind, too. He\u0027s a bright kid, and he knew they weren\u0027t useful.\" \"If he\u0027s so bright,\" Gennaro said, \"where\u0027d he go? Because I\u0027d stay right here and wait to be picked up.\" \"Yes,\" Muldoon said. \"But perhaps he couldn\u0027t stay here. May the tyrannosaur came back. Or some other animal. Anyway, something made him leave.\" \"Then where\u0027d he go?\" Gennaro said, \"Let\u0027s see if we can determine that,\" Muldoon said, and he strode off toward the main road. Gennaro watched Muldoon peering at the ground with his flashlight. His face was just inches from the mud, intent on his search. Muldoon really believed he was on to something, that at least one of the kids was still alive. Gennaro remained unimpressed. The shock of finding the severed leg had left him with a grim determination to close the park, and destroy it. No matter what Muldoon said, Gennaro suspected him of unwarranted enthusiasm, and hopefulness, and- \"You notice these prints?\" Muldoon asked, still looking at the ground. \"What prints?\" Gennaro said. \"These footprints-see them, coming toward us from up the road?-and they\u0027re adult-size prints. Some kind of rubber-sole sboe. Notice the distinctive tread pattern. Gennaro saw only mud. Puddles catching the light from the flashlights. \"You can see,\" Muldoon continued, \"the adult prints come to here, where they\u0027re joined by other prints. Small, and medium-size . . . moving around in circles, overlapping . . . almost as if they\u0027re standing together, talking. . . . But now here they are, they seem to be running. He pointed off. \"There. Into the park.\" Gennaro shook his head. \"You can see whatever you want in this mud.\" Muldoon got to his feet and stepped back. He looked down at the ground and sighed. \"Say what you like, I\u0027ll wager one of the kids survived. And maybe both. Perhaps even an adult as well, if these big prints belong to someone other than Regis, We\u0027ve got to search the park.\" \"Tonight?\" Gennaro said. But Muldoon wasn\u0027t listening. He had walked away, toward an embankment of soft earth, near a drainpipe for rain. He crouched again. \"What was that little girl wearing?\" \"Christ,\" Gennaro said. \"I don\u0027t know.\" Proceeding slowly, Muldoon moved farther toward the side of the road. And then they heard a wheezing sound. It was definitely an animal sound. \"Listen,\" Gennaro said, feeling panic, \"I think we better-\" \"Shhh,\" Muldoon said. He paused, listening. \"It\u0027s just the wind,\" Gennaro said. They heard the wheezing again, distinctly this time. It wasn\u0027t the wind. It was coming from the foliage directly ahead of him, by the side of the road. It didn\u0027t sound like an animal, but Muldoon moved forward cautiously. He waggled his light and shouted, but the wheezing did not change character. Muldoon pushed aside the fronds of a palm. \"What is it?\" Gennaro said, \"It\u0027s Malcolm,\" Muldoon said. Ian Malcolm lay on his back, his skin gray-white, mouth slackly open. His breath came in wheezing gasps. Muldoon handed the flashlight to Gennaro, and then bent to examine the body. \"I can\u0027t find the injury,\" he said. \"Head okay, chest, arms . . .\" Then Gennaro shone the light on the legs. \"He put a tourniquet on.\" Malcolm\u0027s belt was twisted tight over the right thigh. Gennaro moved the light down the leg. The right ankle was bent outward at an awkward angle from the leg, the trousers flattened, soaked in blood. Muldoon touched the ankle gently, and Malcolm groaned. Muldoon stepped back and tried to decide what to do next. Malcolm might have other injuries. His back might be broken. It might kill him to move him. But if they left him here, he would die of shock. It was only because he had had the presence of mind to put a tourniquet on that he hadn\u0027t already bled to death. And probably he was doomed. They might as well move him. Gennaro helped Muldoon pick the man up, hoisting him awkwardly over their shoulders. Malcolm moaned, and breathed in ragged gasps. \"Lex,\" he said. \"Lex . . . went . . . Lex . . .\" \"Who\u0027s Lex?\" Muldoon said. \"The little girl,\" Gennaro said. They carried Malcolm back to the Jeep, and wrested him into the back seat. Gennaro tightened the tourniquet around his leg. Malcolm groaned again. Muldoon slid the trouser cuff up and saw the pulpy flesh beneath, the dull white splinters of protruding bone. \"We\u0027ve got to get him back,\" Muldoon said. \"You going to leave here without the kids?\" Gennaro said. \"If they went into the park, it\u0027s twenty square miles,\" Muldoon said, shaking his head. \"The only way we can find anything out there is with the motion sensors. If the kids are alive and moving around, the motion sensors will pick them up, and we can go right to them and bring them back. But if we don\u0027t take Dr. Malcolm back right now, he\u0027ll die.\" \"Then we have to go back,\" Gennaro said. \"Yes, I think so.\" They climbed into the car. Gennaro said, \"Are you going to tell Hammond the kids are missing?\" \"No,\" Muldoon said. \"You are.\" Control Donald Gennaro stared at Hammond, sitting in the deserted cafeteria. The man was spooning ice cream, calmly eating it. \"So Muldoon believes the children are somewhere in the park?\" \"He thinks so, yes.\" \"Then I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll find them.\" \"I hope so,\" Gennaro said. He watched the old man deliberately eating, and he felt a chill. \"Oh, I am sure we\u0027ll find them. After all, I keep telling everyone, this park is made for kids.\" Gennaro said, \"Just so you understand that they\u0027re missing, sir.\" \"Missing?\" he snapped. \"Of course I know they\u0027re missing. I\u0027m not senile.\" He sighed, and changed tone again. \"Look, Donald,\" Hammond said. \"Let\u0027s not get carried away. We\u0027ve had a little breakdown from the storm or whatever, and as a result we\u0027ve suffered a regrettable, unfortunate accident. And that\u0027s all that\u0027s happened. We\u0027re dealing with it. Arnold will get the computers cleaned up. Muldoon will pick up the kids, and I have no doubt he\u0027ll be back with them by the time we finish this ice cream. So let\u0027s just wait and see what develops, shall we?\" \"Whatever you say, sir,\" Gennaro said. \"Why?\" Henry Wu said, looking at the console screen. \"Because I think Nedry did something to the code,\" Arnold said. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m checking it.\" \"All right,\" Wu said. \"But have you tried your options?\" \"Like what?\" Arnold said. \"I don\u0027t know. Aren\u0027t the safety systems still running?\" Wu said. \"Keychecks? All that?\" \"Jesus,\" Arnold said, snapping his fingers. \"They must be. Safety systems can\u0027t be turned off except at the main panel.\" \"Well,\" Wu said, \"if Keycheeks is active, you can trace what he did.\" \"I sure as hell can,\" Arnold said. He started to press buttons. Why hadn\u0027t he thought of it before? It was so obvious. The computer system at Jurassic Park had several tiers of safety systems built into it. One of them was a keycheck program, which monitored all the keystrokes entered by operators with access to the system. It was originally installed as a debugging device, but it was retained for its security value. In a moment, all the keystrokes that Nedry had entered into the computer earlier in the day were listed in a window on the screen: 13,42,121,32,88,77,19,13,122,13,44,52,77,90,13,99,13,100,13,109,55,103 144,13,99,87,60,13,44,12,09,13,43,63,13,46,57,89,103,122,13,44,52,88,9 31,13,21,13,57,98,100,102,103,13,112,13,146,13,13,13,77,67,88,23,13,13 system nedry goto command level nedry 040/ # xy/67\u0026 mr goodbytes security keycheck off safety off sl off security whte_rbt.obj \"That\u0027s it?\" Arnold said. \"He was screwing around here for hours, it seemed like.\" \"Probably just killing time,\" Wu said. \"Until he finally decided to get down to it.\" The initial list of numbers represented the ASCI keyboard codes for the keys Nedry had pushed at his console. Those numbers meant he was still within the standard user interface, like any ordinary user of the computer. So initially Nedry was just looking around, which you wouldn\u0027t have expected of the programmer who had designed the system. \"Maybe he was trying to see if there were changes, before he went in,\" Wu said. \"Maybe,\" Arnold said. Arnold was now looking at the list of commands, which allowed him to follow Nedry\u0027s progression through the system, line by line. \"At least we can see what he did.\" system was Nedry\u0027s request to leave the ordinary user interface and access the code itself. The computer asked for his name, and he replied: nedry. That name was authorized to access the code, so the computer allowed him into the system. Nedry asked to goto command level, the computer\u0027s highest level of control. The command level required extra security, and asked Nedry for his name, access number 7 and password. nedry 040/# xy/67\u0026 mr goodbytes Those entries got Nedry into the command level. From there he wanted security. And since he was authorized, the computer allowed him to go there. Once at the security level, Nedry tried three variations: keycheck off safety off sl off \"He\u0027s trying to turn off the safety systems,\" Wu said. \"He doesn\u0027t want anybody to see what he\u0027s about to do.\" \"Exactly,\" Arnold said. \"And apparently he doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s no longer possible to turn the systems off except by manually flipping switches on the main board.\" After three failed commands, the computer automatically began to worry about Nedry. But since he had gotten in with proper authorization, the computer would assume that Nedry was lost, trying to do something he couldn\u0027t accomplish from where he was. So the computer asked him again where he wanted to be, and Nedry said: security. And he was allowed to remain there. \"Finally,\" Wu said, \"here\u0027s the kicker.\" He pointed to the last of the commands Nedry had entered. Whte_rbt.obj \"What the hell is that?\" Arnold said. \"White rabbit? Is that supposed to be his private joke?\" \"It\u0027s marked as an object,\" Wu said. In computer terminology, an \"object\" was a block of code that could be moved around and used, the way you might move a chair in a room. An object might be a set of commands to draw a picture, or to refresh the screen, or to perform a certain calculation. \"Let\u0027s see where it is in the code,\" Arnold said. \"Maybe we can figure out what it does.\" He went to the program utilities and typed: FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ The computer flashed back: OBJECT NOT FOUND IN LIBRARIES \"It doesn\u0027t exist,\" Arnold said. \"Then search the code listing,\" Wu said. Arnold typed: FIND/LISTINGS: WHTE-RBT.OBJ The screen scrolled rapidly, the lines of code blurring as they swept past. It continued this way for almost a minute, and then abruptly stopped. \"There it is,\" Wu said. \"It\u0027s not an object, it\u0027s a command.\" The screen showed an arrow pointing to a single line of code: curv \u003d GetHandl {ssm.dt} tempRgn {itm.dd2}. curh \u003d GetHandl {ssd.itli} tempRgn2 {itm.dd4}. on DrawMeter(!gN) set shp-val.obi to lim(Val{d})-Xval. if ValidMeter(mH) (**mH).MeterVis return. if Meterband](vGT) ((DrawBack(tY)) return. limitDat.4 \u003d maxbits (%33) to {limit 04} set on. limitDat.5 \u003d setzero, setfive, 0 {limit .2-var(szb)}. on whte-rbt.obi call link.sst {security, perimeter} set to off. Vertrange\u003d{maxrange+setlim} tempVgn(fdn-\u0026bb+$404). Horrange\u003d{maxRange-setlim/2} tempHgn(fdn-\u0026dd+$105). void DrawMeter send-screen.obi print. \"Son of a bitch,\" Arnold said. Wu shook his head. \"It isn\u0027t a bug in the code at all.\" \"No,\" Arnold said. \"It\u0027s a trap door. The fat bastard put in what looked like an object call, but it\u0027s actually a command that links the security and perimeter systems and then turns them off. Gives him complete access to every place in the park.\" \"Then we must be able to turn them back on,\" Wu said. \"Yeah, we must.\" Arnold frowned at the screen. \"All we have to do is figure out the command. I\u0027ll run an execution trace on the link,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll see where that gets us.\" Wu got up from his chair. \"Meanwhile,\" he said, \"meanwhile, that somebody went into the freezer about an hour ago. I think I better go count my embryos.\" Ellie was in her room, about to change out of her wet clothes, when there was a knock on the door. \"Alan?\" she said, but when she opened the door she saw Muldoon standing there, with a plastic-wrapped package under his arm. Muldoon was also soaking wet, and there were streaks of dirt on his clothes. \"I\u0027m sorry, but we need your help,\" Muldoon said briskly. \"The Land Cruisers were attacked an hour ago. We brought Malcolm back, but he\u0027s in shock. He\u0027s got a very bad injury to his leg. He\u0027s still unconscious, but I put him in the bed in his room. Harding is on his way over.\" \"Harding?\" she said. \"What about the others?\" \"We haven\u0027t found the others yet, Dr. Sattler,\" Muldoon said. He was speaking slowly now. \"Oh, my God.\" \"But we think that Dr. Grant and the children are still alive. We think they went into the park, Dr. Sattler.\" \"Went into the park?\" \"We think so. Meanwhile, Malcolm needshelp. I\u0027ve called Harding.\" \u0027Shouldn\u0027t you call the doctor?\" \"There\u0027s no doctor on the island. Harding\u0027s the best we have.\" \"But surely you can call for a doctor-\" she said. \"No.\" Muldoon shook his head. \"Phone lines are down. We can\u0027t call out.\" He shifted the package in his arm. \"What\u0027s that?\" she said. \"Nothing. Just go to Malcolm\u0027s room, and help Harding, if you will.\" And Muldoon was gone. She sat on her bed, shocked. Ellie Sattler was not a woman disposed to unnecessary panic, and she had known Grant to get out of dangerous situations before. Once he\u0027d been lost in the badlands for four days when a cliff gave way beneath him and his truck fell a hundred feet into a ravine. Grant\u0027s right leg was broken. He had no water. But he walked back on a broken leg. On the other hand, the kids . . . She shook her head, pushing the thought away. The kids were probably with Grant. And if Grant was out in the park, well . . . what better person to get them safely through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert? In the Park \"I\u0027m tired,\" Lex said. \"Carry me, Dr. Grant.\" \"You\u0027re too big to carry,\" Tim said. \"But I\u0027m tired,\" she said. \"Okay, Lex,\" Grant said, picking her up. \"Oof, you\u0027re heavy.\" It was almost 9:00 p.m. The full moon was blurred by drifting mist, and their blunted shadows led them across an open field, toward dark woods beyond. Grant was lost in thought, trying to decide where he was. Since they had originally crossed over the fence that the tyrannosaur had battered down, Grant was reasonably sure they were now somewhere in the tyrannosaur paddock. Which was a place he did not want to be. In his mind, he kept seeing the computer tracing of the tyrannosaur\u0027s home range, the tight squiggle of lines that traced his movements within a small area. He and the kids were in that area now. But Grant also remembered that the tyrannosaurs were isolated from all the other animals, which meant they would know they had left the paddock when they crossed a barrier-a fence, or a moat, or both. He had seen no barriers, so far. The girl put her head on his shoulder, and twirled her hair in her fingers. Soon she was snoring. Tim trudged alongside Grant. \"How you holding up, Tim?\" \"Okay,\" he said. \"But I think we might be in the tyrannosaur area.\" \"I\u0027m pretty sure we are. I hope we get out soon.\" \"You going to go into the woods?\" Tim said. As they came closer, the woods seemed dark and forbidding. \"Yes,\" Grant said. \"I think we can navigate by the numbers on the motion sensors.\" The motion sensors were green boxes set about four feet off the ground. Some were freestanding; most were attached to trees. None of them were working, because apparently the power was still off. Each sensor box had a glass lens mounted in the center, and a painted code number beneath that. Up ahead, in the mist-streaked moonlight, Grant could see a box marked T/S/04. They entered the forest. Huge trees loomed on all sides. In the moonlight, a low mist clung to the ground, curling around the roots of the trees. It was beautiful, but it made walking treacherous. And Grant was watching the sensors. They seemed to be numbered in descending order. He passed T/S/03, and T/S/02. Eventually they reached T/S/01. He was tired from carrying the girl, and he had hoped this would coincide with a boundary for the tyrannosaur paddock, but it was just another box in the middle of the woods. The next box after that was marked T/N/01, followed by T/N/02. Grant realized the numbers must be arranged geographically around a central point, like a compass. They were going from soutb to north, so the numbers got smaller as they approached the center, then got larger again. \"At least we\u0027re going the right way,\" Tim said. \"Good for you,\" Grant said. Tim smiled, and stumbled over vines in the mist. He got quickly to his feet. They walked on for a while. \"My parents are getting a divorce,\" he said. \"Uh-huh,\" Grant said. \"My dad moved out last month. He has his own place in Mill Valley now. \"Uh-huh.\" \"He never carries my sister any more. He never even picks her up.\" \"And he says you have dinosaurs on the brain,\" Grant said. Tim sighed. \"Yeah.\" \"You miss him?\" Grant said. \"Not really,\" Tim said. \"Sometimes. She misses him more.\" \"Who, your mother?\" \"No, Lex. My mom has a boyfriend. She knows him from work.\" They walked in silence for a while, passing T/N/03 and T/N/04. \"Have you met him?\" Grant said. \"Yeah.\" \"How is he?\" \"He\u0027s okay,\" Tim said. \"He\u0027s younger than my dad, but he\u0027s bald.\" \"How does he treat you?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Okay. I think he just tries to get on my good side. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen. Sometimes my mom says we\u0027ll have to sell the house and move. Sometimes he and my mom fight, late at night. I sit in my room and play with my computer, but I can still hear it.\" \"Uh-huh,\" Grant said. \"Are you divorced?\" \"No,\" Grant said. \"My wife died a long time ago.\" \"And now you\u0027re with Dr. Sattler?\" Grant smiled in the darkness. \"No. She\u0027s my student.\" \"You mean she\u0027s still in school?\" \"Graduate school, yes.\" Grant paused long enough to shift Lex to his other shoulder, and then they continued on, past T/N/05 and T/N/06. There was the rumble of thunder in the distance. The storm had moved to the south. There was very little sound in the forest except for the drone of cicadas and the soft croaking of tree frogs. You have children?\" Tim asked. \"No,\" Crant said. \"Are you going to marry Dr. Sattler?\" \"No, she\u0027s marrying a nice doctor in Chicago sometime next year. \"Oh,\" Tim said. He seemed surprised to hear it. They walked along for a while. \"Then who are you going to marry?\" \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to marry anybody,\" Grant said. \"Me neither,\" Tim said. They walked for a while. Tim said, \"Are we going to walk all night?\" \"I don\u0027t think I can,\" Grant said. \"We\u0027ll have to stop, at least for a few hours.\" He glanced at his watch. \"We\u0027re okay. We\u0027ve got almost fifteen hours before we have to be back. Before the ship reaches the mainland.\" \"Where are we going to stop?\" Tim asked, immediately. Grant was wondering the same thing. His first thought was that thev might climb a tree, and sleep up there. But they would have to climb very high to get safely away from the animals, and Lex might fall out while she was asleep. And tree branches were hard; they wouldn\u0027t get any rest. At least, he wouldn\u0027t. They needed someplace really safe. He thought back to the plans he had seen on the jet coming down. He remembered that there were outlying buildings for each of the different divisions. Grant didn\u0027t know what they were like, because plans for the individual buildings weren\u0027t included. And he couldn\u0027t remember exactly where they were, but he remembered they were scattered all around the park. There might be buildings somewhere nearby. But that was a different requirement from simply crossing a barrier and getting out of the tyrannosaur paddock, Finding a building meant a search strategy of some kind. And the best strategies were- \"Tim, can you hold your sister for me? I\u0027m going to climb a tree and have a look around.\" High in the branches, he had a good view of the forest, the tops of the trees extending away to his left and right. They were surprisingly near the edge of the forest-directly ahead the trees ended before a clearing, with an electrified fence and a pale concrete moat. Beyond that, a large open field in what he assumed was the sauropod paddock. In the distance, more trees, and misty moonlight sparkling on the ocean. Somewhere he heard the bellowing of a dinosaur, but it was far away. He put on Tim\u0027s night-vision goggles and looked again. He followed the gray curve of the moat, and then saw what he was looking for: the dark strip of a service road, leading to the flat rectangle of a roof. The roof was barely above ground level, but it was there. And it wasn\u0027t far. Maybe a quarter of a mile or so from the tree. When he came back down, Lex was sniffling. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"I heard an aminal.\" \"It won\u0027t bother us. Are you awake now? Come on.\" He led her to the fence. It was twelve feet high, with a spiral of barbed wire at the top. It seemed to stretch far above them in the moonligbt. The moat was immediately on the other side. Lex looked up at the fence doubtfully. \"Can you climb it?\" Grant asked her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jurassic-park-jurassic-park-1/page-17.html","bookId":1711,"book":{"id":1711,"title":"Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1)","description":"Storyline: Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1) An astonishing technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA has been discovered.
