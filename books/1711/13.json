At six-month intervals?\"\\n\\n \" Yes . . .\"\\n\\n \"Then you should get a graph with peaks for each of the three separate batches that were introduced,\" Malcolm said, tapping the keyboard. \"Like this.\"\\n\\n [picture]\\n\\n \"But you didn\u0027t get this graph,\" Malcolm said. \"The graph you actually got is a graph of a breeding population. Your compys are breeding.\"\\n\\n Wu shook his head. \"I don\u0027t see how.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re breeding, and so are the othnielia, the maiasaurs, the hypsys-and the velociraptors.\"\\n\\n \"Christ,\" Muldoon said. \"There are raptors free in the park.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s not that bad,\" Hammond said, looking at the screen. \"We have increases in just three categories-well, five categories. Very small increases in two of them . . .\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\" Wu said, loudly. \"Don\u0027t you know what this means?\"\\n\\n \"Of course I know what this means, Henry,\" Hammond said. \"It means you screwed up.\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely not.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got breeding dinosaurs out there, Henry.\u0027\\n\\n \"But they\u0027re all female,\" Wu said. \"It\u0027s impossible. There must be a mistake. And look at the numbers. A small increase in the big animals, the maiasaurs and the hypsys. And big increases in the number of small animals. It just doesn\u0027t make sense. It must be a mistake.\"\\n\\n The radio clicked. \"Actually not,\" Grant said. \"I think these numbers confirm that breeding is taking place. In seven different sites around the island.\"\\n\\n Breeding Sites\\n\\n The sky was growing darker. Thunder rumbled in the distance. Grant and the others leaned in the doors of the Jeep, staring at the screen on the dashboard. \"Breeding sites?\" Wu said, over the radio.\\n\\n \"Nests,\" Grant said. \"Assuming the average clutch is eight to twelve hatching eggs, these data would indicate the compys have two nests. The raptors have two nests. The othys have one nest. And the hypsys and the maias have one nest each.\"\\n\\n \"Where are these nests?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to find them,\" Grant said. \"Dinosaurs build their nests in secluded places.\"\\n\\n \"But why are there so few big animals?\" Wu said. \"If there is a maia nest of eight to twelve eggs, there should be eight to twelve new maias. Not just one.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Grant said. \"Except that the raptors and the compys that are loose in the park are probably eating the eggs of the bigger animals and perhaps eating the newly hatched young, as well.\"\\n\\n \"But we\u0027ve never seen that,\" Arnold said, over the radio.\\n\\n \"Raptors are nocturnal,\" he said. \"Is anyone watching the park at night?\"\\n\\n There was a long silence.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t think so,\" Grant said.\\n\\n \"It still doesn\u0027t make sense,\" Wu said. \"You can\u0027t support fifty additional animals on a couple of nests of eggs.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Grant said. \"I assume they are eating something else as well. Perhaps small rodents. Mice and rats?\"\\n\\n There was another silence.\\n\\n \"Let me guess,\" Grant said. \"When you first came to the island, you had a problem with rats. But as time passed, the problem faded away.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. That\u0027s true. . . \"\\n\\n \"And you never thought to investigate why.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we just assumed . . .\" Arnold said.\\n\\n \"Look,\" Wu said, \"the fact remains, all the animals are female. They can\u0027t breed.\"\\n\\n Grant had been thinking about that. He had recently learned of an intriguing West German study that he suspected held the answer. \"When you made your dinosaur DNA,\" Grant said, \"you were working with fragmentary pieces, is that right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Wu said.\\n\\n \"In order to make a complete strand, we\u0027re you ever required to include DNA fragments from other species?\"\\n\\n \"Occasionally, yes,\" Wu said. \"It\u0027s the only way to accomplish the job. Sometimes we included avian DNA, from a variety of birds, and sometimes reptilian DNA.\"\\n\\n \"Any amphibian DNA? Specifically, frog DNA?\"\\n\\n \"Possibly. I\u0027d have to check.\"\\n\\n \"Check,\" Grant said. \"I think you\u0027ll find that holds the answer.\"\\n\\n Malcolm said, \"Frog DNA? Why frog DNA?\"\\n\\n Gennaro said impatiently, \"Listen, this is all very intriguing, but we\u0027re forgetting the main question: have any animals gotten off the island?\"\\n\\n Grant said, \"We can\u0027t tell from these data.\"\\n\\n \"Then how are we going to find out?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s only one way I know,\" Grant said. \"We\u0027ll have to find the individual dinosaur nests, inspect them, and count the remaining egg fragments. From that we may be able to determine how many animals were originally hatched. And we can begin to assess whether any are missing.\"\\n\\n Malcolm said, \"Even so, you won\u0027t know if the missing animals are killed, or dead from natural causes, or whether they have left the island.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Grant said, \"but it\u0027s a start. And I think we can get more information from an intensive look at the population graphs.\"\\n\\n \"How are we going to find these nests?\"\\n\\n \"Actually,\" Grant said, \"I think the computer will be able to help us with that.\"\\n\\n \"Can we go back now?\" Lex said. \"I\u0027m hungry.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, let\u0027s go,\" Grant said, smiling at her. \"You\u0027ve been very patient.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be able to eat in about twenty minutes,\" Ed Regis said, starting toward the two Land Cruisers.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll stay for a while,\" Ellie said, \"and get photos of the stego with Dr. Harding\u0027s camera. Those vesicles in the mouth will have cleared up by tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"I want to get back,\" Grant said. \"I\u0027ll go with the kids.\"\\n\\n \"I will, too,\" Malcolm said.\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027ll stay,\" Gennaro said, \"and go back with Harding in his Jeep, with Dr. Sattler.\"\\n\\n \"Fine, let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n They started walking. Malcolm said, \"Why exactly is our lawyer staying?\"\\n\\n Grant shrugged. \"I think it might have something to do with Dr. Sattler.\"\\n\\n \"Really? The shorts, you think?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s happened before,\" Grant said.\\n\\n When they came to the Land Cruisers, Tim said, \"I want to ride in the front one this time, with Dr. Grant.\"\\n\\n Malcolm said, \"Unfortunately, Dr. Grant and I need to talk.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll just sit and listen. I won\u0027t say anything,\" Tim said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a private conversation,\" Malcolm said.\\n\\n \"Tell you what, Tim,\" Ed Regis said. \"Let them sit in the rear car by themselves. We\u0027ll sit in the front car, and you can use the night-vision goggles. Have you ever used night-vision goggles, Tim? They\u0027re goggles with very sensitive CCDs that allow you to see in the dark.\"\\n\\n \"Neat,\" he said, and moved toward the first car.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" Lex said. \"I want to use it, too.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Tim said.\\n\\n \"No fair! No fair! You get to do everything, Timmy!\"\\n\\n Ed Regis watched them go and said to Grant, \"I can see what the ride back is going to be like.\"\\n\\n Grant and Malcolm climbed into the second car. A few raindrops spattered the windshield. \"Let\u0027s get going,\" Ed Regis said. \"I\u0027m about ready for dinner. And I could do with a nice banana daiquiri. What do you say, folks? Daiquiri sound good?\" He pounded the metal panel of the car. \"See you back at camp\" he said, and he started running toward the first car, and climbed aboard.\\n\\n A red light on the dashboard blinked. With a soft electric whirr, the Land Cruisers started off.\\n\\n Driving back in the fading light, Malcolm seemed oddly subdued. Grant said, \"You must feel vindicated. About your theory.\"\\n\\n \"As a matter of fact, I\u0027m feeling a bit of dread. I suspect we are at a very dangerous point.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Intuition.\"\\n\\n \"Do mathematicians believe in intuition?\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely. Very important, intuition. Actually, I was thinking of fractals,\" Malcolm said. \"You know about fractals?\"\\n\\n Grant shook his head. \"Not really, no.\"\\n\\n \"Fractals are a kind of geometry, associated with a man named Mandelbrot. Unlike ordinary Euclidean geometry that everybody learns in school-squares and cubes and spheres-fractal geometry appears to describe real objects in the natural world. Mountains and clouds are fractal shapes. So fractals are probably related to reality. Somehow.\\n\\n \"Well, Mandelbrot found a remarkable thing with his geometric tools. He found that things looked almost identical at different scales.\"\\n\\n \"At different scales?\" Grant said.\\n\\n \"For example,\" Malcolm said, \"a big mountain, seen from far away, has a certain rugged mountain shape. If you get closer, and examine a small peak of the big mountain, it will have the same mountain shape. In fact, you can go all the way down the scale to a tiny speck of rock, seen under a microscope-it will have the same basic fractal shape as the big mountain.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really see why this is worrying you,\" Grant said. He yawned. He smelled the sulfur fumes of the volcanic steam. They were coming now to the section of road that ran near the coastline, overlooking the beach and the ocean.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a way of looking at things,\" Malcolm said. \"Mandelbrot found a sameness from the smallest to the largest. And this sameness of scale also occurs for events.\"\\n\\n \"Events?\"\\n\\n \"Consider cotton prices,\" Malcolm said. \"There are good records of cotton prices going back more than a hundred years. When you study fluctuations in cotton prices, you find that the graph of price fluctuations in the course of a day looks basically like the graph for a week, which looks basically like the graph for a year, or for ten years. And that\u0027s how things are. A day is like a whole life. You start out doing one thing, but end up doing something else, plan to run an errand, but never get there. . . . And at the end of your life, your whole existence has that same haphazard quality, too. Your whole life has the same shape as a single day.\"\\n\\n \"I guess it\u0027s one way to look at things,\" Grant said.\\n\\n \"No,\" Malcolm said. \"It\u0027s the only way to look at things. At least, the only way that is true to reality. You see, the fractal idea of sameness carries within it an aspect of recursion, a kind of doubling back on itself, which means that events are unpredictable. That they can change suddenly, and without warning.\"\\n\\n \"Okay . . .\"\\n\\n \"But we have soothed ourselves into imagining sudden change as something that happens outside the normal order of things. An accident, like a car crash. Or beyond our control, like a fatal illness. We do not conceive of sudden, radical, irrational change as built into the very fabric of existence. Yet it is. And chaos theory teaches us,\" Malcolm said, \"that straight linearity, which we have come to take for granted in everything from physics to fiction, simply does not exist. Linearity is an artificial way of viewing the world. Real life isn\u0027t a series of interconnected events occurring one after another like beads strung on a necklace. Life is actually a series of encounters in which one event may change those that follow in a wholly unpredictable, even devastating way.\" Malcolm sat back in his seat, looking toward the other Land Cruiser, a few yards ahead. \"That\u0027s a deep truth about the structure of our universe. But, for some reason, we insist on behaving as if it were not true.\"\\n\\n At that moment, the cars jolted to a stop, \"What\u0027s happened?\" Grant said.\\n\\n Up ahead, they saw the kids in the car, pointing toward the ocean. Offshore, beneath lowering clouds, Grant saw the dark outline of the supply boat making its way back toward Puntarenas.\\n\\n \"Why have we stopped?\" Malcolm said.\\n\\n Grant turned on the radio and heard the girl saying excitedly, \"Look there, Timmy! You see it, it\u0027s there!\"\\n\\n Malcolm squinted at the boat. \"They talking about the boat?\"\\n\\n \"Apparently.\"\\n\\n Ed Regis climbed out of the front car and came running back to their window. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, \"but the kids are all worked up. Do you have binoculars here?\"\\n\\n \"For what?\"\\n\\n \"The little girl says she sees something on the boat. Some kind of animal,\" Regis said.\\n\\n Grant grabbed the binoculars and rested his elbows on the window ledge of the Land Cruiser. He scanned the long shape of the supply ship. It was so dark it was almost a silhouette; as he watched, the ship\u0027s running lights came on, brilliant in the dark purple twilight.\\n\\n \"Do you see anything?\" Regis said.\\n\\n \"No,\" Grant said.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re low down,\" Lex said, over the radio. \"Look low down.\"\\n\\n Grant tilted the binoculars down, scanning the bull just above the waterline. The supply ship was broad-beamed, with a splash flange that ran the length of the ship. But it was quite dark now, and he could hardly make out details.\\n\\n \"No, nothing . . .\"\\n\\n \"I can see them,\" Lex said impatiently. \"Near the back. Look near the back! \"\\n\\n \"How can she see anything in this light?\" Malcolm said.\\n\\n \"Kids can see,\" Grant said. \"They\u0027ve got visual acuity we forgot we ever had.\"\\n\\n He swung the binoculars toward the stern, moving them slowly, and suddenly he saw the animals. They were playing, darting among the silhouetted stern structures. He could see them only briefly, but even in the fading light he could tell that they were upright animals, about two feet tall, standing with stiff balancing tails.\\n\\n \"You see them now?\" Lex said.\\n\\n \"I see them,\" he said.\\n\\n \"What are they?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re raptors,\" Grant said, \"At least two. Maybe more. Juveniles.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, \" Ed Regis said. \"That boat\u0027s going to the mainland.\"\\n\\n Malcolm shrugged. \"Don\u0027t get excited. Just call the control room and tell them to recall the boat.\"\\n\\n Ed Regis reached in and grabbed the radio from the dashboard. They heard hissing static, and clicks as he rapidly changed channels. \"There\u0027s something wrong with this one,\" he said. \"It\u0027s not working.\"\\n\\n He ran off to the first Land Cruiser. They saw him duck into it. Then he looked back at them. \"There\u0027s something wrong with both the radios,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t raise the control room.\"\\n\\n \"Then let\u0027s get going,\" Grant said.\\n\\n In the control room, Muldoon stood before the big windows that overlooked the park. At seven o\u0027clock, the quartz floodlights came on all over the island, turning the landscape into a glowing jewel stretching away to the south. This was his favorite moment of the day. He heard the crackle of static from the radios.\\n\\n \"The Land Cruisers have started again,\" Arnold said. \"They\u0027re on their way home.\"\\n\\n \"But why did they stop?\" Hammond said. \"And why can\u0027t we talk to them?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Arnold said. \"Maybe they turned off the radios in the cars.\\n\\n \"Probably the storm,\" Muldoon said. \"Interference from the storm.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll be here in twenty minutes,\" Hammond said. \"You better call down and make sure the dining room is ready for them. Those kids are going to be hungry.\"\\n\\n Arnold picked up the phone and heard a steady monotonous hiss. \"What\u0027s this? What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, hang that up,\" Nedry said. \"You\u0027ll screw up the data stream.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve taken all the phone lines? Even the internal ones?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve taken all the lines that communicate outside,\" Nedry said. \"But your internal lines should still work.\"\\n\\n Arnold punched console buttons one after another. He heard nothing but hissing on all the lines.\\n\\n \"Looks like you\u0027ve got \u0027em all.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry about that,\" Nedry said. \"I\u0027ll clear a couple for you at the end of the next transmission, in about fifteen minutes.\" He yawned. \"Looks like a long weekend for me. I guess I\u0027ll go get that Coke now.\" He picked up his shoulder bag and headed for the door. \"Don\u0027t touch my console, okay?\"\\n\\n The door closed.\\n\\n \"What a slob,\" Hammond said.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Arnold said. \"But I guess he knows what he\u0027s doing.\"\\n\\n Along the side of the road, clouds of volcanic steam misted rainbows in the bright quartz lights. Grant said into the radio, \"How long does it take the ship to reach the mainland?\"\\n\\n \"Eighteen hours,\" Ed Regis said. \"More or less. It\u0027s pretty reliable.\" He glanced at his watch. \"It should arrive around eleven tomorrow morning.\"\\n\\n Grant frowned. \"You still can\u0027t talk to the control room?\"\\n\\n \"Not so far.\"\\n\\n \"How about Harding? Can you reach him?\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027ve tried. He may have his radio turned off.\"\\n\\n Malcolm was shaking his head. \"So we\u0027re the only ones who know about the animals on the ship.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to raise somebody,\" Ed Regis said. \"I mean, Christ, we don\u0027t want those animals on the mainland.\"\\n\\n \"How long until we get back to the base?\"\\n\\n \"From here, another sixteen, seventeen minutes,\" Ed Regis said.\\n\\n At night, the whole road was illuminated by big floodlights. It felt to Grant as if they were driving through a bright green tunnel of leaves. Large raindrops spattered the windshield.\\n\\n Grant felt the Land Cruiser slow, then stop. \"Now what?\"\\n\\n Lex said, \"I don\u0027t want to stop. Why did we stop?\"\\n\\n And then, suddenly, all the floodlights went out. The road was plunged into darkness, Lex said, \"Hey!\"\\n\\n \"Probably just a power outage or something,\" Ed Regis said. \"I\u0027m sure the lights\u0027ll be on in a minute.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell?\" Arnold said, staring at his monitors.\\n\\n \"What happened?\" Muldoon said. \"You lose power?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but only power on the perimeter. Everything in this building\u0027s working fine. But outside, in the park, the power is gone. Lights, TV cameras, everything.\" His remote video monitors had gone black.\\n\\n \"What about the two Land Cruisers?\"\\n\\n \"Stopped somewhere around the tyrannosaur paddock.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" Muldoon said, \"call Maintenance and let\u0027s get the power back on.\\n\\n Arnold picked up one of his phones and heard hissing: Nedry\u0027s computers talking to each other. \"No phones. That damn Nedry. Nedry! Where the hell is he?\"\\n\\n Dennis Nedry pushed open the door marked FERTILIZATION, With the perimeter power out, all the security-card locks were disarmed. Every door in the building opened with a touch.\\n\\n The problems with the security system were high on Jurassic Park\u0027s bug list. Nedry wondered if anybody ever imagined that it wasn\u0027t a bug-tbat Nedry had programmed it that way. He had built in a classic trap door. Few programmers of large computer systems could resist the temptation to leave themselves a secret entrance. Partly it was common sense: if inept users locked up the system-and then called you for help-you always had a way to get in and repair the mess. And partly it was a kind of signature: Kilroy was here.\\n\\n And partly it was insurance for the future. Nedry was annoyed with the Jurassic Park project; late in the schedule, InGen had demanded extensive modifications to the system but hadn\u0027t been willing to pay for them, arguing they should be included under the original contract. Lawsuits were threatened; letters were written to Nedry\u0027s other clients, implying that Nedry was unreliable. It was blackmail, and in the end Nedry had been forced to eat his overages on Jurassic Park and to make the changes that Hammond wanted.\\n\\n But later, when he was approached by Lewis Dodgson at Biosyn, Nedry was ready to listen. And able to say that he could indeed get past Jurassic Park security. He could get into any room, any system, anywhere in the park. Because he had programmed it that way. Just in case.\\n\\n He entered the fertilization room. The lab was deserted; as he had anticipated, all the staff was at dinner. Nedry unzipped his shoulder bag and removed the can of Gillette shaving cream. He unscrewed the base, and saw the interior was divided into a series of cylindrical slots.\\n\\n He pulled on a pair of heavy insulated gloves and opened the walk-in freezer marked CONTENTS VIABLE BIOLOGICAL MAINTAIN -10C MINIMUM. The freezer was the size of a small closet, with shelves from floor to ceiling. Most of the shelves contained reagents and liquids in plastic sacs. To one side he saw a smaller nitrogen cold box with a heavy ceramic door. He opened it, and a rack of small tubes slid out, in a cloud of white liquid-nitrogen smoke.\\n\\n The embryos were arranged by species: Stegosaurus, Apatosaurus, Hadrosaurus, Tyrannosaurus. Each embryo in a thin glass container, wrapped in silver foil, stoppered with polylene. Nedry quickly took two of each, slipping them into the shaving cream can.\\n\\n Then he screwed the base of the can shut and twisted the top. There was a hiss of releasing gas inside, and the can frosted in his hands. Dodgson had said there was enough coolant to last thirty-six hours. More than enough time to get back to San Jose.\\n\\n Nedry left the freezer, returned to the main lab. He dropped the can back in his bag, zipped it shut.\\n\\n He went back into the hallway. The theft had taken less than two minutes. He could imagine the consternation upstairs in the control room, as they began to realize what had happened. All their security codes were scrambled, and all their phone lines were jammed. Without his help, it would take hours to untangle the mess-but in just a few minutes Nedry would he back in the control room, setting things right.\\n\\n And no one would ever suspect what he had done.\\n\\n Grinning, Dennis Nedry walked down to the ground floor, nodded to the guard, and continued downstairs to the basement. Passing the neat lines of electric Land Cruisers, he went to the gasoline-powered Jeep parked against the wall. He climbed into it, noticing some odd gray tubing on the passenger seat. It looked almost like a rocket launcher, he thought, as he turned the ignition key and started the Jeep.\\n\\n Nedry glanced at his watch. From here, into the park, and three minutes straight to the east dock. Three minutes from there back to the control room.\\n\\n Piece of cake.\\n\\n \"Damn it!\" Arnold said, punching buttons on the console. \"It\u0027s all screwed up.\\n\\n Muldoon was standing at the windows, looking out at the park. The lights had gone out all over the island, except in the immediate area around the main buildings. He saw a few staff personnel hurrying to get out of the rain, but no one seemed to realize anything was wrong. Muldoon looked over at the visitor lodge, where the lights burned brightly.\\n\\n \"Uh-oh,\" Arnold said. \"We have real trouble.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" Muldoon said. He turned away from the window, and so he didn\u0027t see the Jeep drive out of the underground garage and head east along the maintenance road into the park.\\n\\n \"That idiot Nedry turned off the security systems,\" Arnold said. \"The whole building\u0027s opened up. None of the doors are locked any more.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll notify the guards,\" Muldoon said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the least of it,\" Arnold said. \"When you turn off the security, you turn off all the peripheral fences as well.\"\\n\\n \"The fences?\" Muldoon said.\\n\\n \"The electrical fences,\" Arnold said. \"They\u0027re off, all over the island.\"\\n\\n \"You mean . . .\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Arnold said. \"The animals can get out now.\" Arnold lit a cigarette. \"Probably nothing will happen, but you never know. . . .\"\\n\\n Muldoon started toward the door. \"I better drive out and bring in the people in those two Land Cruisers,\" he said. \"Just in case.\"\\n\\n Muldoon quickly went downstairs to the garage. He wasn\u0027t really worried about the fences going down. Most of the dinosaurs had been in their paddocks for nine months or more, and they had brushed up against the fences more than once, with notable results. Muldoon knew how quickly animals learned to avoid shock stimuli. You could train a laboratory pigeon with just two or three stimulation events. So it was unlikely the dinosaurs would now approach the fences.\\n\\n Muldoon was more concerned about what the people in the cars would do. He didn\u0027t want them getting out of the Land Cruisers, because once the power came back on, the cars would start moving again, whether the people were inside them or not. They might be left behind. Of course, in the rain it was unlikely they would leave the cars. But, still ... you never knew. . . .\\n\\n He reached the garage and hurried toward the Jeep. It was lucky, he thought, that he had had the foresight to put the launcher in it. He could start right out, and he out there in-\\n\\n It was gone!\\n\\n \"What the hell?\" Muldoon stared at the empty parking space, astonished.\\n\\n The Jeep was gone!\\n\\n What the hell was happening?\\n\\n FOURTH ITERATION\\n\\n [picture]\\n\\n \"Inevitably, underlying instabilities begin to appear.\"\\n\\n IAN MALCOLM\\n\\n The Main Road\\n\\n Rain drummed loudly on the roof of the Land Cruiser. Tim felt the night-vision goggles pressing heavily on his forehead. He reached for the knob near his ear and adjusted the intensity. There was a brief phosphorescent flare, and then, in shades of electronic green and black, he could see the Land Cruiser behind, with Dr. Grant and Dr. Malcolm inside. Neat!\\n\\n Dr. Grant was staring out the front windshield toward him. Tim saw him pick up the radio from the dash. There was a burst of static, and then he heard Dr. Grant\u0027s voice: \"Can you see us back here?\"\\n\\n Tim picked up the radio from Ed Regis. \"I see you.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jurassic-park-jurassic-park-1/page-13.html","bookId":1711,"book":{"id":1711,"title":"Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1)","description":"Storyline: Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park #1) \\n An astonishing technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA has been discovered.
