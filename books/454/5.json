{"id":25958,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV A LITTLE RIPPLE OF PATRIOTISM","content":"\"You are bold, my son, at any rate,\" murmured my heathen priest, blandly smiling through me into vacancy. \"The last man to knock at the gate of Tzin Pia?u with his foot, found the foot grown fast to the stone. They had to cut it off to set him free. That must have been a hundred years ago, more or less. I forget. The foot, with the gate-post attached to it, is standing in the Great Hall of the Images. Relic, you know. It\u0027s rather interesting, it\u0027s so out of the common run of relics. You might like to glance at it?\" \"No, indeed,\" I said hastily. Something in my old gentleman\u0027s blandness was anything but reassuring. \"I beg Tzin Pia?u\u0027s pardon, I am sure,\" said I. \"And,\" said I, pulling out my purse, \"if in my hurry I was unfortunate enough to injure the door in any way, I\u0027d be more than glad—\" \"Not at all, not at all,\" my old gentleman assured me. \"It\u0027s a very solid door, indeed.\" \"I\u0027m so glad of that,\" said I, putting up my purse. \"Still,\" purred the old gentleman thoughtfully, \"of course one can never tell just how a god may feel about irreverence. In cases of doubt, the small precaution of an offering—\" I handed him a piece of gold, and he stowed it away, very carefully, in his girdle, just over the pit of his stomach. \"My son,\" he said benignantly, \"through me, his representative, T\u0027zin Pia?u deigns to thank you and assure you that all is forgotten.\" Receiving the thanks of a god was such an unwonted experience to me that I was not sure I could acknowledge them in proper form. So I bowed, and held my tongue. There are worse moves, in tight places, for one who can bow with dignity. \"And now, my son,\" said my old gentleman, poking subconsciously with the forefinger of his right hand at a hard spot just over his stomach, \"tell me what has put you out. For you are put out.\" \"It\u0027s your infernal Little Gods,\" said I, boldly. \"I\u0027m sick of them.\" \"My infernal Little Gods!\" he murmured. \"What a curious conjunction of contradictory terms. And so you are sick of them. Why?\" \"Their taste seems to run wholly to Tragedy,\" I complained, \"and such dingy Tragedy. And such unnecessary Tragedy. How they do work to entangle some childish negro giant, some weak simpleton of a common soldier—\" My old gentleman yawned, hard as he strove to conceal the fact. \"You must excuse me,\" he purred, when he saw that I had seen, \"but really, at this hour— Suppose,\" he suggested, sinking back on his slab, \"you watch a Farce or two, by way of change. How will that do?\" \"If you think there are any Farces in the Orient,\" I said doubtfully, \"I\u0027m sure I\u0027d be very glad—\" \"It\u0027s easy to find out,\" said he, and moved his hand a little, and—I heard a voice speaking, an even, drawling, dryly humorous voice. This is what it said. \"Want passes, eh? Twelve-hour passes? H\u0027m,\" says the Captain. Me and Big Terry Clancy and three or four others was standin\u0027 up in front of him with three months\u0027 pay in our blouses, lookin\u0027 pleasant and harmless for a fare-ye-well. \"H\u0027m,\" he says, \"you\u0027re a fine bunch. Can you remember you\u0027re in Maniller now, not Samar?\" \"We can, sir,\" says Terry. \"H\u0027m. Take your mouth out fr\u0027m under your chin, Clancy,\" says th\u0027 Old Man. \"It looks better. H\u0027m. Well, go along with ye, and if ye get into trouble ast th\u0027 Lord to have mercy on your crazy heads, for ye know well by this time that I won\u0027t,\" he says. With that he signs the passes, an\u0027 that\u0027s where he let us all in for it. Yes, sir, me and Terry an\u0027 th\u0027 Old Man and the Regiment and the Little Brown Brother and the C.G. all had ours comin\u0027 right then, on\u0027y we didn\u0027t know about it, not yet. We thought we was just homeward bound, and we wanted a little fun with Maniller to make up for the deeprivations of the Samar campaign. We got it all right. \"H\u0027m,\" says the Captain, dealin\u0027 us the passes. \"I\u0027m sorry f\u0027r Maniller, but ye have earned a little reelaxation. Don\u0027t forget you\u0027re f\u0027r guard to-morrer, Casey,\" he says to me, an\u0027 we saluted an\u0027 hit th\u0027 trail. Terry and me clumb into a two-wheeled chicken-coop wagon outside the Barracks, and th\u0027 horse not bein\u0027 only boy\u0027s size we lifted him by th\u0027 slings, th\u0027 pair of us, and just naturally wandered on tiptoe down to th\u0027 New Bridge. They give you th\u0027 biggest schooner of San Magill f\u0027r your peseta there. New Bridge is th\u0027 name. Anybody can tell you. We had some beers, and then we went across to Mrs. Smith\u0027s, and got a steak that never seen a tin can, and then we went back to the New Bridge and met up with some more of th\u0027 Army. There was an Engineer\u0027t could deal himself th\u0027 coldest hand of talk I ever bucked up against, and two Coast Artillerys, and a Marine, an Irishman named Schleimacher, that Clancy remembered helpin\u0027 to stuff a jade idol into his blouse, up in Peking those happy days. Maybe there was others. I don\u0027t remember. I don\u0027t remember a whole lot of things about that day. Some way, the beer was cold, and along in the middle of th\u0027 afternoon my thoughts got to herdin\u0027 close, an\u0027 it was more\u0027n I could do to cut some of th\u0027m out of th\u0027 bunch an\u0027 read th\u0027 brands on th\u0027m. There must a been strays around, too, for all of-a sudden I got to cryin\u0027 about me dear ould mither an\u0027 th\u0027 little cabin—Me! I was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, in a tenement, and I pulled my freight for Arizona as soon as I could walk. But I sure was cryin\u0027 about that thought, whoever it belonged to, and the Engineer ast me what th\u0027 trouble was, and I told on myself. \"Gentlemen o\u0027 France,\" says he—I ain\u0027t quotin\u0027 him exact, f\u0027r I\u0027m no college graduate—\"Gentlemen o\u0027 France, and Ireland, what say you to charterin\u0027 a couple of wagons, large, glad wagons with rubber tires, and carryin\u0027 our brother out to refresh his homesick eyes on th\u0027 emerald, sunburnt sod of th\u0027 Luneta, whilst Professor Lovering\u0027s gu-gu band flirts with sweet music and we watches th\u0027 sunset glow on Mariveles?\" Yes, sir, right off\u0027n th\u0027 bat he showed down a hand of talk like that, all aces an\u0027 better. It fazed us f\u0027r a minute. He was a warm boy, that Engineer. But old Terry was game. \"Son of th\u0027 pick-axe an\u0027 th\u0027 thebobolite,\" he says, startin\u0027 to play up, \"lead on,\" he says, \"that is—if—if ye mean go to th\u0027 band concert, we\u0027re with ye while th\u0027 money lasts,\" he finishes, winded. So we gets a couple of victoriers, two horses apiece, footmen and all, and strikes for th\u0027 Luneta, makin\u0027 full as much show as any civilian clerk in th\u0027 Q.M.D. More, maybe, f\u0027r that Irishman Schleimacher wants to put his feet up on th\u0027 box. We tried to make him ride decent, but th\u0027 Engineer butted in. \"Let him be,\" he says. \"Otherwise what\u0027s th\u0027 use of th\u0027 footman, anyway?\" So Sly kep\u0027 them up there, and I reckon we attracted a lot of attention that didn\u0027t cost us a cent. By the time we got out there by the beach, th\u0027 air had cleared up my head some, and I sat up and began to take notice. And about the first thing I noticed hard was Terry. He\u0027d quit talkin\u0027, an\u0027 there was a hell uv a disdainful look on that two-foot face of his, and he took off his hat to the flagpole when we went by it, second trip round. I\u0027d ought to have stopped th\u0027 game right then. There\u0027s two kinds of Irish, if y\u0027 ever noticed,—common wild ones that generally has the luck to meet Old Trouble when she comes marchin\u0027 down th\u0027 street, comp\u0027ny front; and th\u0027 fancy kind that could recruit a whole bunch o\u0027 trouble right in th\u0027 middle of Paco bone-heap. Terry\u0027s that last kind, and when he gets low-spirited and patriotic and full of beer, it\u0027s time to hunt for the tall and uncut. Well, the band kep\u0027 on a playin\u0027, an\u0027 th\u0027 sun kep\u0027 on a settin\u0027 and we kep\u0027 on a drivin\u0027 round and round that mangy bunch o\u0027 grass, and ev\u0027ry trip Terry got glummer and glummer. After a while, he says to me: \"Look at th\u0027 pretty ladies, Casey, all th\u0027 pretty ladies in white dresses an\u0027 talcum powder, if not worse. An\u0027 spot th\u0027 gay young grafters in th\u0027 morgidged rigs. You and me can\u0027t speak to th\u0027 likes of them, Casey. We\u0027re nothin\u0027 but soldiers. That\u0027s all. Just soldiers, gettin\u0027 it in th\u0027 neck for fifteen-sixty per. Oh, hell!\" he says, and spits hard and straight at a swell native in white clothes, that was waitin\u0027 for us to pass, \"Look at him with shoes on, like a white man! Ain\u0027t there a ripple o\u0027 patriotism in th\u0027 whole damned outfit? There\u0027s th\u0027 old flag flyin\u0027 up above th\u0027m, an\u0027 they never think of it. Just ride around and flirt with each other, and let natives walk around with shoes on, like white men. They make me sick. I\u0027m on\u0027y a soldier, an\u0027 I suppose th\u0027 Army is th\u0027 on\u0027y place f\u0027r lads like me and you—\" he says. He\u0027s ready to cry, an\u0027 th\u0027 Engineer butts in to change th\u0027 subjick. \"So say our long-suffering parents and sweethearts,\" he says. \"Pontoons,\" says Terry, talkin\u0027 fr\u0027m about an inch below his stummick, \"you\u0027re a lively lad with y\u0027r tongue, but ye lack dep\u0027. I ain\u0027t known ye long, an\u0027 I hope I ain\u0027t to know ye much longer, but I can see ye lack more dep\u0027 \u0027n any man I ever met. There\u0027s moments in th\u0027 life of a real man ye couldn\u0027t no more understand \u0027n a Chinese storekeeper. An\u0027 this is one of th\u0027m,\" he says, pullin\u0027 his hat down over his eyes. He didn\u0027t say no more, but when th\u0027 nigger band struck up th\u0027 Umpty-dee-he-hee-heee music, to show it was all over now, Terry got up slow and stiff, and threw a chest and squeezed his hat to his left breast and stood there in th\u0027 rig, lookin\u0027 considerable like some gen\u0027rals you and me\u0027ve seen. He kep\u0027 on standin\u0027 there after th\u0027 music had stopped, and after a while it got tiresome, and th\u0027 Engineer told th\u0027 cochero to sigue ahead. \"Hindi!\" says Terry. \"Don\u0027t you believe it. You\u0027re like all th\u0027 rest,\" he says to us, plumb disgusted. \"You call yourselves soldiers, and all you think about is just chow. Chow, at a moment like this! There ain\u0027t a ripple of patriotism in the whole bunch of ye big enough to grease a twenty-two cartridge.\" And he made us drive up and down th\u0027 Malecon twice in th\u0027 moonlight before he\u0027d go to supper. While we was chowin\u0027, he kep\u0027 gettin\u0027 grumper an\u0027 grumper, and after supper, when th\u0027 Engineer wanted to be gettin\u0027 back to quarters—he was livin\u0027 over\u0027n old Santiaygo—Terry just busted loose. \"Pontoons,\" he says, \"I t\u0027ought you was a man. You\u0027re big enough f\u0027r one. Run away an\u0027 join th\u0027 Naytional Guard. Go an\u0027 be a pinkety-pink Vol\u0027nteer, an\u0027 tell th\u0027 nurs\u0027ry-sergeant not to wake you up without your p\u0027rmission. Go an\u0027 dog-rob f\u0027r a c\u0027mission. Go an\u0027 do this an\u0027 do that,\" he says, thinkin\u0027 up a whole lot of places f\u0027r th\u0027 Engineer to go, till fin\u0027lly he got so ugly-ugly we took him into th\u0027 New Bridge again, and bought him a drink to calm him down. It didn\u0027t do no good. He kep\u0027 one eye on his glass an\u0027 th\u0027 other on the Engineer, an\u0027 slung hot air till you wouldn\u0027t think a big guy like that would stand f\u0027r it. But th\u0027 Engineer just grins and drinks his beer. \"Gentlemen,\" he says, \"gentlemen and friend Clancy, there\u0027s a hard-hearted son of Plymouth Rock commands th\u0027 comp\u0027ny that\u0027ll be roundin\u0027 up all th\u0027 poor little devils to check roll-call six times a day before he\u0027s been dead a month. He\u0027ll mult me a month\u0027s pay f\u0027r missin\u0027 Retreat to-night—not that th\u0027 pleasure of enjoyin\u0027 you ain\u0027t worth th\u0027 price,\" he says to Terry, \"but I might just as well miss Taps now, an\u0027 get a month in th\u0027 jug besides. What\u0027s th\u0027 use of freedom without money? To-night we have both, and we\u0027ll pour them out like blood, to soothe th\u0027 feelin\u0027s of a friend whose heart is sad to think th\u0027 flag which decked his cradle now floats over th\u0027 school-houses of th\u0027 brave but ex-tremely eelusive Fillypeeners.\" Terry\u0027s mouth sort of hung open when th\u0027 Engineer struck his pace, but he brightened up quick as he got on to the drift of it. \"Ye read my feelin\u0027s like a padre,\" he says to him, \"an\u0027 I like your build. If you was on\u0027y in th\u0027 comp\u0027ny, it\u0027s many a fight we\u0027d have together, an\u0027 we may have one even yet. Here\u0027s lookin\u0027 at ye! You\u0027re a soldier, you are, and a gentleman. Here\u0027s how.\" Of course we had a beer on the Engineer after that, and two on the Coast Artillerys, who\u0027d been sayin\u0027 little all day and drinkin\u0027 hearty. Th\u0027 poor devils get that way, bein\u0027 stationed mostly near big cities like Portland, Maine, an\u0027 Guam, where chanstes are few since th\u0027 Christian Temp\u0027rance persons got their strangle-holt. And then our A.O.H. friend, Schleimacher, sets them up an\u0027 says: \"Fellers, a sailor like me—\" \"Don\u0027t you miscall yourself; you\u0027re more of soldier than a heap of th\u0027 muts I herd with,\" says Terry, takin\u0027 a sling at us, \"but ye do loot like a sailor,\" he says. \"I\u0027m a soldier at sea, all right,\" says th\u0027 Marine. \"I\u0027m seasick as an Army Transport ev\u0027ry trip. I was talkin\u0027 when you butted in. A sailor like me don\u0027t have many look-ins f\u0027r what you might call reefined amusements. Cavite\u0027s mostly give up to drill an\u0027 cock-fights. I moves we all go to a nigger theayter to-night, where there\u0027s sure to be plenty doin\u0027, such as it is.\" We went, victoriers and all, and Old Trouble must a been howlin\u0027 f\u0027r joy to see us comin\u0027. When we got there, there was a big crowd outside, and we got wedged up against one of th\u0027 stands where th\u0027 girls sell bananas and cigarettes an\u0027 such truck. One of th\u0027m—a pretty good-lookin\u0027 girl she was, too—smiles at Terry, and he opens up a conversation, and fin\u0027lly he says to me: \"\u0027Tis a long time since I\u0027ve et a hard-boiled egg. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to have a couple if they\u0027re fresh. \"Frescoes?\" he asts, pointin\u0027 to the eggs. \"Wavoes frescoes?\" Fresco means cool in common bamboo Spanish, but he was usin\u0027 a private Castilian brand of his own. \"Wavoes frescoes?\" he asts. \"Is the eggs cool?\" Th\u0027 girl laughs. \"Como helados, chiquito mio,\" she says, laughin\u0027. \"Like ice, my honey-bunch,\" she says. \"Give me two, then, an\u0027 keep th\u0027 change,\" says Terry. \"Dos! You\u0027re a neat little gu-gu,\" he says, holdin\u0027 up his two fingers. He broke one of his eggs, and he dropped it quick. \"Ye little merrocker-leather daughter o\u0027 sin and shame,\" he says to th\u0027 girl—I ain\u0027t quotin\u0027 him exact neither—\"ye little two-f\u0027r-a-cent bunch o\u0027 calicker,\" he says, mixin\u0027 in some other words on the side, \"bein\u0027 a lady, I can\u0027t say what I think of you, but it ain\u0027t such a hell uv a much. Don\u0027t ye grin at me! I might have et that! If it had on\u0027y knowed enough to peep,\" he says to us, \"it needn\u0027t never have got boiled alive. Wavoes frescoes! Damn a country where a pretty girl will lie to you f\u0027r half a cent. I\u0027ll keep th\u0027 other one till I\u0027m sure hungry,\" he says, an\u0027 slips his other egg into his pocket. He kep\u0027 on mutterin\u0027 to himself while he was squeezin\u0027 up to th\u0027 little window, and a good tight squeeze we had. Y\u0027 see, old Ma Trouble[1] had c\u0027llected a special crowd f\u0027r the occasion, but we never noticed that. We just hiked ahead, and havin\u0027 plenty of money—though little of it was left by that time—we bought a box, and went in. [1] It is interesting to note that Private Casey himself seems half aware that some maliciously mirthful over-power is concerned in his adventures. But why does he feminize it? Maybe you\u0027ve never been in a gu-gu theayter. Th\u0027 floor is th\u0027 ground, an\u0027 that\u0027s the orchestray. Around that runs a row of boxes without any fronts or backs or tops or sides. Behind them is th\u0027 balcony. Well, we swell guys pikes up to our box and starts in to be th\u0027 real thing. In one of them theayters you want to keep your hat on till th\u0027 curtain rises, an\u0027 smoke cigarettes an\u0027 look round at th\u0027 women. They expects it. That was easy f\u0027r us, an\u0027 th\u0027 Engineer gets up a two-handed game of eyes with a chocolate-colored dame that begins to look entanglin\u0027. But Terry broke it up. \"Turn round,\" he says. \"Cut it out. She\u0027ll be settin\u0027 in your lap in a minute, an\u0027 stealin\u0027 th\u0027 buttons off\u0027n your blouse. Don\u0027t ye trust any of th\u0027m,\" he says. \"Wavoes frescoes!\" And right there old Ma plays her joker. That drayma we\u0027d come so far to see was called \"Kahapon—\" but maybe you don\u0027t sabe hablar Fillypeener. \"Yesterday, To-day, and To-morrer,\" was th\u0027 name. Th\u0027 first act was Yesterday. That was Spain. There was nothin\u0027 much doin\u0027 f\u0027r a while. Just talkin\u0027 slow an\u0027 keepin\u0027 your hand on your knife, a good deal like that Greaser show that come to San Antone once. But after a while, a priest showed up. He was one of th\u0027 Friars, and they knocked him down first off, an\u0027 then they kicked him all over th\u0027 stage, and sat on him and raised a rough-house with him for fair. Them Frailes must a been a long-sufferin\u0027 bunch, Yesterday. They\u0027d just tossed him out of sight, when a lot of Spanish soldiers come on and th\u0027 real shootin\u0027 begun. Well, sir, th\u0027 Fillypeeners cleaned them Greasers out for keeps, an\u0027 th\u0027 little leadin\u0027 lady grabs th\u0027 Spanish flag an\u0027 rips it up th\u0027 middle an\u0027 promenades on th\u0027 pieces. Th\u0027 house went wild at that, and while they was clappin\u0027 an\u0027 shoutin\u0027, the sun of Fillypeener liberty begun to rise at th\u0027 back of the stage. It was a shaky old sun with three K\u0027s on its face, like freckles. I see Terry fumblin\u0027 in his pocket for somethin\u0027, and then, just as th\u0027 sun is gettin\u0027 fairly up, somethin\u0027 puts th\u0027 poor thing\u0027s eye out, and th\u0027 curtain falls quick. \"Wavoes frescoes!\" Terry sings out. Well, sir, things livened up somethin\u0027 wonderful just about then. All th\u0027 natives in th\u0027 place, about a thousand of th\u0027m, begun to yowl like cats and crowd toward our box, and half a dozen Spaniards, or half-Spaniards, was yellin\u0027 \"Brayvo el Americano!\" and some Americans that was scattered round th\u0027 audience was movin\u0027 up at th\u0027 double without sayin\u0027 anythin\u0027. \"Nothin\u0027 doin\u0027, boys,\" Terry yells to them, standin\u0027 up, and a big man he looked. \"Scat!\" he says to th\u0027 natives. \"Sigue Dagupan, you Kittycattypunanos, before I chew you up,\" he says, and makes like he was goin\u0027 to jump down among th\u0027m. They scatted all right, and we pulled Terry down, quiet enough, on\u0027y his shoulders was twitchin\u0027 under his blouse. \"Casey,\" he says to me, \"I always took the Fillypeeners f\u0027r Catholics till I seen th\u0027m maul that padre, an\u0027 I\u0027ve been gentle with th\u0027m on that account. God help th\u0027 next one I lay foot to.\" \"I mistrust this is one of th\u0027 seditious plays we read about,\" th\u0027 Engineer whispers to me, \"and I reckon To-day will be worse than Yesterday, f\u0027r the big man. Hadn\u0027t we better get him out of here?\" \"His patriotism is sure ripplin\u0027 lively,\" I says. \"An\u0027 did ye never read th\u0027 po\u0027m,\" says th\u0027 lad, \"about th\u0027 pebble dropped in th\u0027 middle of th\u0027 ocean, an\u0027 th\u0027 ripples it kicked up?\" \"I never read no po\u0027try,\" I says, \"if I see it first, but something\u0027ll be kicked up f\u0027r keeps, if Terry ever drops down in that crowd.\" And then th\u0027 house quieted down, an\u0027 th\u0027 curtain went up f\u0027r th\u0027 next act. To-day was us, th\u0027 Americans. A little gen\u0027ral with pompydoor hair—that looked natchral—walked round f\u0027r a while, hablaring to his crowd, and then six men in khaki came in, carryin\u0027 th\u0027 flag, and th\u0027 other gang began to shoot them up. It warn\u0027t pretty to watch, on\u0027y we didn\u0027t have time to watch it much. Th\u0027 Engineer an\u0027 me had one of Terry\u0027s arms, and Schleimacher was tryin\u0027 to keep a hand over his mouth and not get bit. Th\u0027 talk he was tryin\u0027 to make was shockin\u0027. But we held him all right till th\u0027 Americans was lyin\u0027 round th\u0027 stage picturesque and dead as hell. An\u0027 then th\u0027 little girl grabs th\u0027 flag, and you could hear the audience draw a long breath. I didn\u0027t think she\u0027d dare to do it, but I suppose it was on th\u0027 programme and they didn\u0027t want to give no money back. Sure enough she spits on it an\u0027 tosses it on th\u0027 floor, and then—well, Terry brushes the Engineer and me out of his way, and steps up on the edge of the box and makes his little speech. \"Boys!\" he yells, \"remember Balangiga an\u0027 th\u0027 rest of th\u0027 tricks they\u0027ve played us. That\u0027s th\u0027 flag,\" and he hops down to the floor. \"Come on,\" I yells to the Engineer. \"If he gets on that stage alone, it\u0027ll be murder,\" and down we jumps. It was like slippin\u0027 off a ford into quick water. The women was screechin\u0027 and the men howlin\u0027 and the boys behind us was laughin\u0027 and shoutin\u0027 and bangin\u0027 every head that came their way, and some fool begun to let off a gun into the roof. But th\u0027 Engineer and me just kep\u0027 on down that aisle after Terry. Just when he reached th\u0027 musicians, the curtain came down, but he picks a fiddler, fiddle and all, and tosses him into th\u0027 rotten old cloth like a sack of beans, and goes through th\u0027 hole after him. But it stopped him up enough so\u0027t the Engineer and me clumb through onto the stage right behind him. We piled onto him just as he was makin\u0027 a rush f\u0027r a bunch of actors, and there was a good lively mix-up f\u0027r a few seconds. Men began to come through the curtain in a dozen places, and th\u0027 racket in the house doubled up. I don\u0027t know just everythin\u0027 that happened, f\u0027r th\u0027 minute Terry gave in a bit, we drug him out th\u0027 back way and cut up an alley, never stoppin\u0027 to find out where Schleimacher and the Artillerys was. And I s\u0027pose them victoriers is out front there yet, waitin\u0027 for their money. And I\u0027ll bet there never was no To-morrer in that drayma, not that night. We got out onto the corner where there\u0027s a saloon, and then we stopped to listen. Same as always, the minute Terry couldn\u0027t do no more harm, he was gentle as a child. \"There\u0027s patriotism around all right,\" he says, cockin\u0027 his head toward the racket back at the theayter. \"It on\u0027y needs somebody to stir it up. I\u0027ll bet anybody five to one in beers that somebody gets hurt out of this before it\u0027s over,\" he says, as a extry loud howl and a ripple of shots busts loose fr\u0027m the theayter, and a patrol-wagon comes ting-tingin\u0027 it down the street. \"I make it beer,\" says Terry, \"because I\u0027m thirsty.\" \"Take you and lose,\" says th\u0027 Engineer. \"Step in here and we\u0027ll pay up one of th\u0027m now.\" So we stepped in there, and we stepped in sev\u0027ral other places, till we sort of got th\u0027 habit. I reckon we traveled all over Maniller after that, and had beers with about half th\u0027 Army. Th\u0027 last thing I remember, Terry had got patriotic again, an\u0027 was sayin\u0027 a po\u0027m about th\u0027 flag. Then my thoughts got to advancin\u0027 in regimental formation, and I sort of went to sleep. Th\u0027 dinky little guard-mount march was goin\u0027 next mornin\u0027—I reckon it was next mornin\u0027—when I woke up, so I knew somethin\u0027 was wrong. I reached f\u0027r my rifle, me bein\u0027 warned for guard that day, and I found I was in th\u0027 guard-house a\u0027ready, and Terry was poundin\u0027 his ear on a bunk beside me. My head felt like a caraboo had walked on it, an\u0027 I yelled to the sentry for water. \"The ice-water\u0027s over\u0027n th\u0027 corner, same as always,\" he says, peekin\u0027 in through th\u0027 bars. \"You sure ain\u0027t forgotten this quick?\" \"What did we do?\" I asts him, sizzlin\u0027 down about a quart in one gulp. \"What didn\u0027t ye do? Pers\u0027nally ye did up three of us while we was puttin\u0027 you in th\u0027 cooler here. Ye came home singin\u0027 in a carrermatter \u0027bout 3 A.M., an\u0027 Terry wanted to bring th\u0027 cochero in an\u0027 kneel him in front of th\u0027 flagpole an\u0027 cut his head off. You was tryin\u0027 to borry a bay\u0027net f\u0027r th\u0027 ceremony. But I guess you\u0027ll get to rememberin\u0027 most all you did, and some more, before th\u0027 Old Man gets through with you. He\u0027s had a squad of cops and an orderly fr\u0027m headquarters to call on him a\u0027ready this mornin\u0027. Fr\u0027m what they said, I should judge you tried to bust up the little old Civil Gov\u0027ment and clean up the L.B.B. Don\u0027t be bashful about th\u0027 water,\" he says. \"It\u0027s all f\u0027r you.\" While I was sloshin\u0027 ice-water over my head, Terry woke up. We sat on the edges of our bunks and talked it all over. We didn\u0027t feel real affectionate. We was still talkin\u0027, sort of aimless but effective, when the guard came an\u0027 took us out to the orderly-room and lined us up in front of th\u0027 Old Man. \"H\u0027m,\" he says, swingin\u0027 back in his chair. \"Do ye desire to call any witnesses to prove ye didn\u0027t do it?\" \"No, sir,\" we both says quick. We\u0027d known him f\u0027r some time. \"H\u0027m. That\u0027s lucky f\u0027r you,\" he says. \"I don\u0027t mind havin\u0027 men try to run my guard at three in th\u0027 mornin\u0027,\" he says, talkin\u0027 to the ceilin\u0027 like an old friend, \"nor tryin\u0027 to murder a coachman on my p\u0027rade-ground, nor blackin\u0027 th\u0027 eye of th\u0027 sergeant of th\u0027 guard. H\u0027m. Ye\u0027ve got to ex-pect them little things fr\u0027m real soldiers, of course,\" he says. \"H\u0027m. But when I have to drive away six policemen before breakfast who\u0027ve came to arrest two of my men f\u0027r assaultin\u0027 several hundred natives all to onct, I\u0027ve got to draw th\u0027 line. There\u0027s eddy-toryals about them men in all th\u0027 native papers this mornin\u0027, or so I am informed accordin\u0027 to th\u0027 best of my ability, and in th\u0027 Cable-News. A brutal attack on peaceable, well-disposed Fillypeeners, and on hundreds of th\u0027m at that, is an assault to the foundations of government which I can\u0027t overlook. H\u0027m.\" \"She spit on th\u0027 flag, sir,\" says Terry. \"Th\u0027 Colonel wanted them men for a G.C.M. this mornin\u0027,\" says the Old Man, \"to say nothin\u0027 of what th\u0027 civil authorities want th\u0027m for, and that\u0027s a whole lot. But there ain\u0027t been a gen\u0027ral pris\u0027ner out of this comp\u0027ny for five year now, and I persuaded the Commandin\u0027 Officer that I could attend to th\u0027 case. H\u0027m. What do you think about that, Casey?\" \"Yessir,\" I says. \"H\u0027m. And Clancy?\" \"Yessir,\" Terry says. \"H\u0027m,\" says he, \"y\u0027r confidence in me is flatterin\u0027. I\u0027ll try not to disappoint ye,\" he says, and gets up an\u0027 goes limpin\u0027 round th\u0027 room on his Tientsin leg. He walks around there f\u0027r five minutes, anyway, before he says a word. Fin\u0027lly he stops and looks out of the window. \"A very pretty p\u0027rade-ground we have here, Mr. Boyd,\" he says to the Lieutenant. \"Very pretty, sir,\" says the Lieutenant, puzzled to know what the Old Man would be carin\u0027 about parade-grounds just then. He hadn\u0027t served with him as long as me and Clancy had. You remember how the old barracks is built, in a hollow square round a p\u0027rade big enough f\u0027r a regimental corral, with th\u0027 post flagstaff stickin\u0027 up in th\u0027 middle, and lookin\u0027 about three hundred foot high? \"H\u0027m,\" says th\u0027 Captain, gazin\u0027 out of his window. \"Very pretty, indeed. But do you notice how the grass is growin\u0027 up between th\u0027 flagstones in the paths? That\u0027s not neat, Mr. Boyd. That\u0027s not fittin\u0027 in a place where the shadder of th\u0027 Flag must fall,\" he says, glancin\u0027 at us. \"H\u0027m. They tell me you\u0027re becomin\u0027 somethin\u0027 of a patriot, Clancy?\" \"Yessir,\" says Terry. \"H\u0027m. And Casey?\" \"Yessir,\" I says. \"That\u0027s fine,\" says th\u0027 Old Man. \"That\u0027s a pleasant surprise. H\u0027m. But I hear ye have been wastin\u0027 y\u0027r patriotism in wild firin\u0027,\" he says. \"It\u0027s too vallyouble to waste, \u0027specially in Maniller. I must try to help you make it flow in a gentle, steady stream. H\u0027m. If you let it fly in chunks, it closely resimbles annichy,\" he says, \"\u0027specially in Maniller. H\u0027m. Sentry, march these men to the p\u0027rade and see that they pluck the grass, all the grass, between the stones, tie it in bundles of fifty stalks, neat bundles, and place the bundles at the foot of the post flagstaff. H\u0027m. And, Sentry, see that after depositin\u0027 each bundle, they retire twelve paces and salute their flag before resumin\u0027 work. After you have cleaned th\u0027 p\u0027rade,\" he says to us, \"I trust I shall be able to find some other work for you. If ye either of you feel y\u0027r patriotism flaggin\u0027 under th\u0027 strain, just tell th\u0027 sentry and he will bring you in to me and I will try to revive it. H\u0027m. You understand, Sentry?\" \"Yessir,\" says th\u0027 sentry. His mouth was twistin\u0027 up on him, an\u0027 th\u0027 Lieutenant\u0027s, an\u0027 everybody\u0027s, but just us and the Old Man\u0027s. He looks sort of surprised. \"Is they any jokes around here I ain\u0027t noticed?\" he says. \"I do love a joke. H\u0027m. You seen any, Clancy?\" \"Nossir,\" says Terry, pretty sick. The sentry grinned all th\u0027 time he was marchin\u0027 us out, an\u0027 the news spread quick, and they was grins to meet us all the way. An\u0027 then th\u0027 sentry begins to guy us. \"You\u0027ve skipped a stalk on y\u0027r left flank, Clancy,\" he says. \"I shall have to report it. And tie th\u0027m in neat bundles of twelve stalks, is the orders, retire fifty paces, and salute th\u0027 flag.\" \"Cut it out, Skinny,\" says Terry. \"He said bundles of fifty. I heard him m\u0027self.\" \"Bundles o\u0027 hell an\u0027 fifty paces,\" says Skinny. \"You can go an\u0027 ast him if ye won\u0027t believe me. Wouldn\u0027t ye like, perhaps, to go an\u0027 ast him? I\u0027ll march ye in with pleasure.\" \"Have y\u0027r laugh while ye\u0027ve got a place f\u0027r it,\" says Terry. \"I\u0027ll make y\u0027r face over for ye, ye hyeener, when I get a chanst.\" \"Intimidatin\u0027 a sentry,\" says Skinny, but he shut up, far as talk went. On\u0027y he made a bugle of his nose, an\u0027 begun to hum little tunes through it, and then th\u0027 crowd begun driftin\u0027 out on th\u0027 verandahs and caught on, and all you could hear was that whole damn parrot-faced battalion blowin\u0027 through their noses, Umpty-dee-he-hee-heee-he-he-hee-hum-hum-hum! Terry and me said nothin\u0027 and picked busy f\u0027r a while, but about th\u0027 hundre\u0027th bundle th\u0027 hot stones and th\u0027 sun an\u0027 yesterday\u0027s beer an\u0027 th\u0027 crowd loafin\u0027 in th\u0027 cool verandahs an\u0027 ev\u0027rything else all took holt of me to onct. \"You\u0027re an ornament to th\u0027 Service,\" I says, tryin\u0027 to crawl into th\u0027 shadder of the pole. \u0027Twas about a mile long and an inch wide. \"Stow y\u0027r face,\" says Terry, tyin\u0027 a bundle with a thumb big as three of it. \"I\u0027d enjoy tellin\u0027 you what I think of you,\" I says, \"on\u0027y I can\u0027t think of it all to onct. How\u0027s y\u0027r patriotism ripplin\u0027 now?\" I says. \"Looka th\u0027 Flag, th\u0027 dear old Flag, floatin\u0027 up above y\u0027r crazy head.\" Terry swallers hard. \"Casey,\" he says, \"I may uv let ye in f\u0027r this, but—\" He picks up his little bundle and carries it over to th\u0027 foot of th\u0027 pole. Then he falls back and salutes. Then he comes over to me, an\u0027 his face was blossomin\u0027 into a grin! Yessir, there was a hole in them rugged features of his you could\u0027ve shoved a blanket-roll into. \"Oh, Casey,\" he says, \"Casey, man, if th\u0027 Old Boy soaks it to us this way f\u0027r what we done, wouldn\u0027t ye, oh, wouldn\u0027t ye just like to see what he\u0027d a done to that theayter, if he was runnin\u0027 this little old town?\" An\u0027 thinkin\u0027 of that, I grinned too. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297/90184.html","bookId":454,"book":{"id":454,"title":"The Little Gods","description":"简介： For the life of me, as I was sitting here this sunny, late-October morning, I could not write, a distressing condition, truly, for one who lives by writing....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
