{"id":25963,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX AN OPTIMIST","content":"I cannot hope to describe to you my dismay at finding myself back in that ancient temple of Tzin Pia?u, nor the dislike with which I looked into the eyes of that old heathen priest, those slant eyes where cynical amusement, like a little, undying flame, danced and flickered. \"And so,\" said the bland old gentleman, raising himself languidly on his hollowed slab of stone, \"and so you find the company of the ladies more agreeable than mine? I do not wonder. How did you leave them all in the temple of Lal?\" It would be impossible to indicate the sly mockery which rustled in his tone. \"So that was your doing, too?\" I asked. He moved a deprecatory hand, smiling blandly through me into space. \"I may have been used as an unworthy instrument,\" he murmured, \"but for most of your experience, I fancy, you\u0027re indebted to the Little Gods themselves. Did you find amusement, or instruction, was it?—forgive me, I forget—in the Games they showed you?\" \"I\u0027m very tired of your Little Gods, if they exist,\" I said bluntly, for he made me angry. \"As I told you once, and as I would tell them to their faces, I think them cowards. I ask you again, do they never give their victims a fair chance? Is there never a single plaything of theirs which, fighting bravely and in good faith, is permitted to win? Are the dice always cogged?\" \"You like to see them win?\" my old heathen priest asked in bland surprise. \"What a very commonplace taste; for people are always winning what they strive for, thousands of them every day. It\u0027s only the exceptions, the surprises, which are interesting. I thought you asked to see Life through my eyes. But since your taste runs that way—\" he yawned ever so slightly behind his hand—\"You\u0027ll excuse me, won\u0027t you?\" he apologized, \"but this is an hour which I invariably devote to a nap.\" He made a little careless, dismissing gesture. \"Wander where you choose,\" said he, \"and watch men fight, since that\u0027s your taste, and win—what they may win.\" It was my dismissal, and there I saw him last, as I had seen him first, lying motionless on his hollowed slab, smiling blandly, cynically, into Emptiness, with light yet bitter mockery in his smile. Then, or so it seemed to me, I wandered far and long, and saw many men striving mightily for many things, and most of them were winners, and most of them, winning, found themselves no nearer their hearts\u0027 desires. But among them I marked three, and have remembered them, whose striving seemed to me not wholly without interest. The first of them was a very common-seeming man indeed, and the only thing about him which made him worthy of remark was, that he was an optimist. Samar is a sorry strip of island which rises in gray-green, commonplace, and yet sinister ugliness from a green and treacherous sea. Its coasts are a desolation of over-thrifty vegetation. Its interior, so far as it has been explored, is a wilderness of forest and precipitous mountains. And the people who inhabit it are worthy of the place, outcasts and refugees from other islands, outlawed men for whom no other spot of earth holds a future. Toward the end of 1901, soldiers and marines and sailors, the 41st Infantry, U.S.A., among them, were rushed to Samar to punish the murderers of Balangiga and cleanse the plague-spot of the Philippines of its spawn. The work proved to be difficult and slow. The blazing summer had darkened into such winter as the Eastern tropics know, a season of lowering skies and deluges of rain, and dank cold and boisterous winds, and still the quarry flitted elusively from stronghold to stronghold of the untracked mountains, emerging at rare intervals to strike with murderous suddenness at unexpected places and then disappear, as hard to bring to bay as any other beast of prey which makes cunning atone for its lack of strength and courage. At Sabey, a hopeless town half-way up the east coast of the island, Company B of the 41st was stationed, as hard-fisted, hard-mouthed, hard-living, hard-fighting a set of terriers as ever was enlisted. Its Captain, one Burrell, delighted in catching his pets wild and taming them to his peculiar taste. B\u0027s ranks, for the most part, were filled by transfer from other organizations whose officers were glad to turn over their black sheep. Burrell, by some method of his own, speedily made soldiers, his sort of soldiers, of them, and they swore by him. It was unusual for B to sit in garrison when the 41st was afield, for the company had a reputation consonant with its character, and was welcome at the front whenever there was action. But all that autumn it was held in quarters, while the rain drummed on the iron roof and reports came in of little battles north and south and west. \"Ev\u0027rybody had a man\u0027s size grouch on, fr\u0027m th\u0027 Old Man down,\" they reported afterward. \"Ev\u0027rybody but just John Henry Sullivan, him we called Peaceful Henry. You couldn\u0027t hammer a grouch onto Peaceful with an axe.\" Sullivan was the humorist of the company, a long, lank, freckled figure-of-fun who was tolerated, ordinarily, though unmercifully mocked, for a certain likable simplicity of mind and a childish friendliness for everything. But that fall his antics palled on B. \"They was times when we\u0027d a been glad to kill him,\" as they said, \"if it hadn\u0027t been for havin\u0027 to look forrard to a long enlistment with him down below.\" But at the very end of the year a hope of cornering the enemy appeared, and the spirits of B Company rose accordingly. Midway of its length, Samar narrows till a scant thirty-five miles separates the long rollers of the Pacific shore from the quieter waters of the Visayan Sea. So, at least, the triangulation of the Coast Survey bore witness, then. Until that winter there was no record of men who had crossed the savage island. But a local tradition asserted that an old and long-abandoned trail led from Sabey on the east coast, that very Sabey where B was stationed, to Nalang on the west. If that ancient trail could be opened once more, Samar would be cut in two, the activity of the skulking outlaws would be impeded, and a scheme of effective reconcentration would be possible at last. The men of B Company felt that their old luck was with them when the duty of making the first reconnaissance of the old trail fell to them. They were ready to move at once, and soon after reveille, on the morning of December 25th, Captain Burrell, Lieutenant Roberts, and twenty men, all dressed in the blue and khaki of field service, and bearing haversacks bulging with four days\u0027 rations, assembled on the beach at Sabey to make an attempt at crossing Samar. It was an inauspiciously gray and threatening morning. Behind the explorers, breakers crashed thunderously on the sand, and a roaring northeast monsoon whipped spume about in frothy sheets. Before them, the wilderness lay grim and forbidding, in the cold light. But they accepted the rawness and the gloom with the indifference of long acquaintance. Four marches straight westward, of ten miles each at most, child\u0027s play to men like them, should bring them to Nalang. There was no breath of adventure in the air. Yet of the party which faced the hills that morning, seven lie within the shadow still, and only one came out again unaided, seventeen days later, to report that somewhere behind him fourteen men of B, including the Old Man who made it B, lay starving and delirious with fever. On the morning of the start, they had of course no premonition of all this. Burrell and Roberts waved careless farewells to the one lady of Sabey, the post surgeon\u0027s young wife, the men grumbled aimlessly at the prospect of a wet march and a wet camp, and Sullivan, settling his haversack strap more comfortably, grinned at the disappointed ones in front of quarters who could not go. \"Reckon we\u0027ll locate that overland route for the Sumner this time, sure,\" he remarked, with a fatuous attempt at humor. \"Fall in,\" the Captain ordered, and the little column set its front westward and swung off along the drenched banks of Sabey River. Four days later, as an early nightfall was closing down, eighteen of the party struggled to the summit of a half-wooded ridge in the interior of the island, and the worn-out men straightened up with momentary eagerness to peer into the cloud-hung west. Only the blankness of further up-tumbled ridges and black waves of forest veiled in sheets of rain lay before them, and to north, south, and east as well. Nowhere on the circle of the horizon was a leaden gleam of the guiding sea. The men seemed dazed. They had made their four marches, of far more than ten miles each, it seemed, at such cost of strength and courage as no one who has not travelled in that land can comprehend. They had made the last march on all but a remnant of their food, and the baffling trail they followed had led them nowhere. An hour before it had vanished in a thicket. Since then they had cut a trail with their bayonets, pushing for this ridge in the hope that from its summit they might see the coast at last. Instead, they found that they were lost in the Samar hills. Faint from hunger and exertion, chilled to the bone from tramping in clammy clothing and sleeping in drenched blankets, with shoes that burst from their swollen feet like pulp and hung in shreds, already halting of speech and step with the burning weakness of fever, half a dozen of them, they stood there in the beating downpour, stunned, and daunted. All this had come to them in four days,—that was the paralyzing fact. It appalled them that all their pride of strength should have vanished in that little space, when other days were coming, how many no one knew, of uglier promise. Foiled, while they still had food and strength, by the task they had set themselves, each day of increased weakness and privation now would call them to increased exertion till the sea was reached—the sea which might, and might not, lie beyond the furthest of those mountains to the west, if it was west. Dumbly they stared at them, avoiding each other\u0027s eyes. Captain Burrell, still weakened by the wound he got in front of Tientsin, was one of the hardest-hit of the fever-victims, and his teeth chattered when he talked, but he retained a humor dryer than the weather. \"I reckon we\u0027ll camp right here,\" he said. \"H\u0027m. We can\u0027t quite fetch the coast to-night, and this ridge is well-drained, anyway. H\u0027m.\" The least weary of the men smiled forlornly in response to the spirit that lived in their Old Man, and Sullivan laughed outright. \"I\u0027ve been lookin\u0027 for a well-dreened place like this to start my cactus-farm in, sir,\" he remarked. Already the formalities of rank had vanished, and discipline meant obedience for the common good, not ceremony. \"Might do it, by irrigating,\" said the Captain. \"H\u0027m.\" He cast a sharp glance at his one unapprehensive subordinate. \"The rest of you camp right here,\" he ordered. \"Sullivan and I are going back along to stir up those loafers who fell out.\" \"See here, sir,\" Lieutenant Roberts cried, in half-hearted protest, for every inch of his six feet of young body was aching dully, \"that leg of yours—\" \"Is a corker,\" said the Captain shortly. \"H\u0027m. Come along, Sullivan.\" An hour later the two, staggering with sleep, herded the last of the sodden, half-delirious stragglers up to the fire which spluttered in the wet and gloom, and the sick men sprawled obediently among their unconscious fellows. For an instant the officer stared down at them. \"Hopeful lot, ain\u0027t they?\" he muttered. \"H\u0027m.\" \"It sure looks some like a graveyard, Captain,\" said Sullivan cheerfully. The Captain glanced at him again. \"Don\u0027t you ever get—blue, Sullivan?\" he asked curiously. Sullivan seemed doubtful. \"I—I do\u0027 know\u0027s I ever thought much about it, sir,\" he said. \"I reckoned not,\" said the Captain. \"H\u0027m. Well, don\u0027t. Go to sleep.\" \"I was thinkin\u0027 I\u0027d keep th\u0027 fire goin\u0027 a while, it looked so kind of homelike,\" Sullivan objected. \"I ain\u0027t much sleepy. You turn in, sir.\" \"I\u0027m not sleepy, either,\" said the other gruffly. \"H\u0027m. Roll in now. Pronto.\" Obediently Sullivan sank down where he stood, and was asleep. Burrell sat long, brooding over the fire, listening to the deep breaths and smothered groanings of his men. One of them babbled in delirium, piteously, for a moment, and the Captain went and soothed him, awkwardly. Then he stood above him, gazing off into the gulf of blackness to the west. He glanced down at the muttering soldier, and away again into the night. \"God damn you,\" he said to the Island of Samar gravely, courteously, as one might deliver a challenge to mortal combat. Next morning they breakfasted on what was left of their food, consuming all but a precious emergency ration of two tins of bacon, a pound and a half in all. Then they pushed on in what was meant to be a last desperate dash for the coast, going down into a long wide valley smothered in primeval forest. Every trail had vanished, each step of advance had to be slashed from a jungle of underbrush and creepers, and for all their suffering they gained a scant five miles. They halted at nightfall in a little opening, where they shed their equipments as they stood, and sprawled among them. Sullivan and the Captain, going back for the many stragglers, failed to discover two of them. They camped that night without food or fire, in a rain that came down harder than ever, if such a thing could be. Next day, without breakfast, they resumed their dogged advance, halting often to rest and search for food. But in that dead season the forest yielded nothing more edible than leaves and bark, and a few woody seed pods like rose-haws in size and shape. \"Hell-apples,\" Sullivan named those, after he had had opportunity to observe their effects. \"They look all right, and they taste all right,\" he explained, \"but they sure do raise hell with your insides.\" The men munched them greedily, despite their uncomforting properties. A time was coming when a rotting log that harbored store of grubs would seem a treasure-house to them. The bayonets did not hack out a trail as rapidly as they had on the day before, and they had made no more than three miles and a half when night shut down. Yet, slow as the advance was, only half a dozen men were up with it, and, when Burrell would have gone back for the others, his wounded leg crumpled under him. Without a word, Lieutenant Roberts joined Sullivan, and it was midnight when the pair brought in the last straggler they could find. Three were still missing, and the Captain forbade further search. \"They\u0027ll have to take a chance,\" he said. \"H\u0027m.\" When the next day broke, merely a lightening of the gloom under the dripping branches, Lieutenant Roberts rose stiffly from the pool that had formed about him in the night and stood, blue-lipped and shaking, over the Captain, whose tortured leg would not permit him to do more than raise himself on one elbow. The two officers faced the situation together. They needed no words. All about them lay the forest of that deadly central valley. Somewhere beyond it, unattainably far for the majority of the men, rose the western rampart of the island. For thirty-six hours they had had no food but hell-apples, the fever was growing on them, and three-fourths of the command, any doctor would have said, could not march a mile. The Captain spoke at last, staring sullenly at the ground. \"Call the men, will you?\" he asked. \"H\u0027m. I reckon it\u0027s time to split.\" Roberts\u0027 face brightened. \"I\u0027ll make it out all right,\" he declared. \"Never felt huskier in my life. I could break world\u0027s records from here to a plate of grub.\" Only ten men of the seventeen who were left responded to the call. The others, roused from the stupor of deep sleep, merely stared up vacantly and muttered, so Roberts let them lie. \"Boys,\" said Burrell, when they had formed a little circle round him, \"\u0027most of us need a lay-off. H\u0027m. So we\u0027re goin\u0027 to rest up here for a couple of days and then push on slow. Mr. Roberts and a couple of you can plug ahead now, though, so\u0027s to have some grub cooked up to meet us. I reckon we\u0027ll raise a famine in Nalang. H\u0027m. Roberts, who\u0027ll you take with you?\" Despite the lightness of the officer\u0027s tone, every man knew what he asked for, and as the subaltern\u0027s eyes swept round the circle, shrewdly weighing each man\u0027s serviceability, shoulders squared and faces took on looks of quite ferocious good cheer. \"I seen you first, sir,\" Terry Clancy cried all at once, and stumbled to his feet. \"I\u0027ve got a fine healthy appetite, myself,\" Sullivan remarked plaintively. \"I\u0027m with you for a sprint, Lieutenant.\" \"You\u0027re too old, Clancy,\" said Roberts kindly. \"I want yearlings for this. And you, Sullivan,\"—his voice held good-natured condescension, as he glanced down at his own bulging chest and sturdy limbs,—\"you\u0027re too spindly. You\u0027re liable to double up, any time.\" At last he chose Red Hannigan and Peter Kelley, two men of his own kind, bull-necked, thick-limbed and heavy-shouldered. The Captain handed him one of the two tins of bacon. \"We\u0027ll look for you back,\" he said, \"long about—H\u0027m—day after to-morrow. Or day after that. H\u0027m.\" The eyes of the officers glinted into each other. \"Sure,\" said Roberts, gravely shaking his commander\u0027s hand. \"Come along, you fellows.\" Twelve days later a party from Nalang found Lieutenant Roberts, the first white man to win across Samar, sitting contentedly on the beach in the sunshine, forty miles above the town, eating snails and aimlessly tossing the shells at what had been his feet. Red Hannigan and Peter Kelley were never found, for Roberts never could remember where they left him. After the departure of the rescue party, apathy settled over the camp in the valley. The Captain straightened his bad leg and lay back with closed eyes. The others lay about him, dozing. Even the worst of the fever-victims only cried out occasionally. Beside the relief of not having to march, cold and wet and hunger and sickness were little things. It was well on in the afternoon when Clancy was roused by a sound which puzzled him. Stumbling out of camp, he came upon a sight which struck him speechless. Sullivan, sitting astride a mouldering log, was wrenching off strips of sodden bark and digging his fingers deep into the punky wood. Suddenly the meaning of it burst on Terry. \"Quit that!\" he cried. \"Quit it, I tell you.\" Sullivan, glancing up, had the grace to redden. Then he lowered his eyes, and resumed his pecking. \"I don\u0027t care,\" he muttered defiantly. \"I\u0027m hungry enough to eat anything.\" Clancy turned away. Presently, from behind a clump of undergrowth, there came the sound of ripping bark. For a while Sullivan, still busy, preserved discreet silence. But his grin broadened slowly, and at last he sang out, \"Hi, Terry! Pick for the little white ones. The others has kind of soured, I reckon.\" There was no answer. After a time another man limped out, watched Sullivan for a little, and soon the sounds of the chase rose from another secluded spot. There was no element of sociability in those meals as yet. Then came a slow succession of days not so tremendously hard to bear, as the pangs of hunger faded into the milder discomfort of starvation, and the fever felled them one by one. Days so like each other that only the calendar notched in the grip of the Captain\u0027s revolver kept their count. Each morning fewer of them were able to join Sullivan in the search for grubs and seed pods, and he began bringing them what spoil of the forest he could find. They took it unquestioningly from his hand, those who were conscious, like children. Indeed, as the days passed, the rough fellows turned for all their needs to the man who had been their butt, and he never failed to meet their primitive wants. That lanky body of his held a surprising store of tough endurance, and he seemed fever-proof. As for his cheerfulness, it was inexhaustible. Big Terry Clancy and the Captain were the last to yield to their weakness, refusing, gently, the food Sullivan brought them. Hard men as those of B were, not one of them, in his sane moments, spoke a word of discontent or of complaint during those days. I like to remember that of them, as I like to remember that I never heard an American regular soldier, traditional grumbler that he is, grumble when he had a reason for it. On the fourth evening after the departure of Lieutenant Roberts, the tenth night out from Sabey and the fifth since they had eaten food for human beings, Sullivan was the only man left stirring in the camp. In spite of the rain—and I would have you read always to the torrential beat of a tropical downpour and the soughing of cold, damp-laden winds—he had managed, with the last of the matches and the powder from half a dozen cartridges, to kindle a fire in a fallen trunk, and had kept it going, and had dragged his comrades round it. He sat beside the Captain, and presently, glancing down, he saw that the officer\u0027s eyes were fixed steadily on him. \"Anything you want, sir?\" he asked. \"How many of us,\" Burrell asked abruptly, \"are what you could call fit?\" Sullivan surveyed the prostrate men about him. \"Well,\" he said imperturbably, \"I reckon there\u0027s me. And you.\" \"H\u0027m,\" the Captain grunted, and even in his sickness his eyes brightened. \"Then,\" he said, \"I reckon it\u0027s up to—us. H\u0027m.\" For a moment he mused, and then he went on, \"It\u0027s no use trying Nalang. Roberts tried that. But if some one could get back to Sabey I think some of the men would try—\" \"The boys would get you out of hell, sir,\" said Sullivan gravely, \"if you sent th\u0027m word.\" \"Think so?\" said Burrell. \"H\u0027m. Well, to-morrow you\u0027d better send word to \u0027em.\" The Captain\u0027s eyes had a queer brightness as he stared at Sullivan, reading his face. \"H\u0027m,\" he muttered at last, \"if I ever do have to get a message out of there, I hope you\u0027ll be round to carry it.\" Something in his tone dragged Sullivan toward him with suddenly blazing eyes. \"Captain,\" he begged, demanding assurance from the man who was his deity, \"do you mean that? No jollyin\u0027 now, sir. You sure think I can do it?\" \"Think?\" said the Captain. \"H\u0027m. I\u0027m bankin\u0027 on you, Sullivan. I know you can do it.\" \"Then,\" said Sullivan blissfully, \"by God, I will, sir.\" Early as it was next morning when Sullivan rose for his start, he found the Captain\u0027s steady eyes on him. \"You don\u0027t need your rifle,\" he said. \"Nor your belt.\" \"I reckon not, sir,\" said Sullivan whimsically, \"not for buggin\u0027.\" \"You take that can of bacon out of my haversack,\" his officer continued. \"I\u0027ve saved it for this.\" \"I don\u0027t need it none, sir,\" said Sullivan, edging away. \"There\u0027d ought to be fine buggin\u0027 back along. An\u0027 hell-apples, I reckon.\" \"Take it,\" said Burrell shortly, and Sullivan yielded to the habit of obedience. He turned for his journey. \"Hold on,\" his officer commanded. \"You\u0027re forgettin\u0027 something.\" He lifted a clawlike hand, and Sullivan gripped it for a minute in silence. He strode across the little opening to the beginning of the back trail. There he halted, turned, and hurled the tin of bacon at his commander. \"You go to hell, sir,\" he shrilled defiantly. \"I\u0027ll do fine, buggin\u0027,\"—and he ran stumblingly down the trail. The Captain twisted his head—it was the only movement he could make—and watched the retreating figure of the mutineer. \"H\u0027m,\" he muttered after it, and shut his eyes, to wait. For the first few hours Sullivan, uplifted by the thought of his mission, went on at what seemed to him a tremendous pace. In reality his knees lifted jerkily, his feet came down flat and stiff, and his stride was that of a child. A giddiness, too, overtook him now and then, and a white mist drifted before his eyes. At such times the walls of the trail seemed to rush by in a blur of green, and he had an exhilarating sense of rapid movement. Long before noon he had covered the three miles and a half to the first camp on the back trail. There he hesitated. A temptingly crumbly log lay beside the trail, and his stomach was cramped with such hunger as he had not felt for days. But he halted only a moment. \"Time enough to eat to-night,\" he muttered, and went on. The afternoon was harder. The giddiness and the mist assailed him oftener, and several times, when the blankness became complete, he was roused by finding that his face had come into not ungentle contact with the ground. Once, doubling limply, he struck his face on his knee instead, and a cut lip gave him the pleasant salty taste of blood. Sharp pains of breathlessness stabbed his sides at intervals, and his heart had fits of throbbing suffocatingly. But he never halted as long as he could see. When the trail was only blackness in the night he sank down. The rain and the light woke him to an accusing sense that it had long been day. He moved on at once. \"I\u0027ll eat when I\u0027ve made that up,\" he muttered, as the blur enclosed him. That day was mostly blur until, along in the afternoon, his mind cleared suddenly. The ground sloped upward under his feet. A rocky, sparsely-wooded ridge rose above him. Remembrance tingled through him. \"My cactus-farm!\" he cried, in delighted recognition. \"I\u0027m gettin\u0027 almost there.\" With his knees doubling under him, he clawed his way to the ridge, and a well-remembered landscape lay about him, dark billows of unbroken forest and a horizon of up-tumbled hills. The huge emptiness of it smote him like a blow and he turned to the old camp. The signs of human occupation, the remembrance of men who had spoken there and of the words they had said, comforted him wonderfully. \"Here,\" he said, having fallen into a way of thinking aloud, \"is where I eat. They\u0027d ought to be fine buggin\u0027 here.\" But the ridge was disappointingly bare of provender. Not a rotten log, not a seed pod, rewarded his toilsome search. At last, where a hanging corner of rock had sheltered it, he came upon a torpid colony of tiger-ants. He looked at them dubiously. \"I wonder,\" he muttered, \"if anybody ever et an ant? I reckon not. Don\u0027t seem to be much to th\u0027m.\" As he stirred the sluggish insects with a doubtful finger, one of them set its mandibles in his flesh. Sullivan\u0027s eyes lit with determination. \"I\u0027m hungrier\u0027n you be, I reckon,\" he said gravely. With the refreshing acidity of his experiment strong on his tongue, he rose at last, regretfully. \"It would seem kind of home-like sleepin\u0027 here,\" he said. \"But I reckon I\u0027d better be gallopin\u0027 along.\" And he pushed on till once more darkness brought him merciful oblivion. He woke to daylight with all his senses clear but one. He understood—there had been times when he forgot even that—that he was Sullivan, that behind him lay his comrades, starving, that before him the trail led to men who needed but a word, and that he had been chosen to take it. But his sense of time was gone. How long he had slept he could not guess. It might have been one night, or many. They might all have died behind him, those sick men and the Old Man who banked on him. In torture at the uncertainty, he rose and stumbled forward again. After a while—it might have been an hour or many days—the trail brought him to a torrential river. He recognized it dimly as the Sabey. They had come up it once, sometime, any time, walking in its rocky bed. Now its swirling waters covered the trail. Painstakingly Sullivan collected his misty faculties. There was a general feeling of morning in the air. By night he must be at Sabey, he was convinced. He must hurry, therefore. A clear idea flashed across his mind. A raft! He must build a raft and hurry with the rushing river, since there was no more trail. He drew his heavy knife-bayonet and turned to the woods. After a while darkness shut down and stopped his work. But he had cut a good many poles. The next thing he knew it was light again, so he dragged one of his poles to the river and dropped it in. It sank. Another and another did the same. When they touched the water they sank. When Sullivan understood that his poles would not float, he lost his steady hopefulness for the first time. But after a while he turned wearily, and stumbled off along the rocky, overhanging banks of Sabey River. When he had walked dizzily a little distance, he fell and lay still. A fall on that cutting volcanic rock was another matter from a fall on the trail. At last he recovered enough to stagger on for a few more steps. Then he fell again. That time he did not rise. But the shock and the loss of blood cleared his head. At last he recognized his predicament. He was through. There was no bitterness in the thought. He had done his best, and failed. The torment of hurry was gone, and he lay and watched the foaming river and the overarching trees. \"I can\u0027t do it,\" Sullivan told himself simply, and quit. But suddenly his merciless self assailed him. \"There\u0027s another way,\" it urged. \"You can do it. Th\u0027 Old Man said so. Try it.\" Weakly, half-sobbing, Sullivan obeyed the summons, and got to his knees. He put out a hand and planted it on the rock, drew up his knee toward it, and his body swayed forward. He put out his other hand, drew up his other knee, swayed forward again. He had gained a foot, at least. \"By God,\" shouted Sullivan\u0027s self to him exultantly, \"you can do it! Try it again. You can\u0027t walk, but you can crawl, I reckon. Whoop-eee-ee! Hit her up!\" And Sullivan, obedient as always, hit her up. And so at last, seventeen days from the time he left Sabey, he returned to it, a blind, gaunt, rain-beaten, silent, grimly crawling thing. He had almost reached the barracks when a soldier, hurrying through the rain, spied him and raised a shout. He revived for a moment when they lifted him, and opened his eyes. \"Back along,\" faltered the messenger. \"Starvin\u0027. Hurry up. God!\" he sighed, and collapsed in their arms. They carried him to the shack they called a hospital, and while the relief party gathered and went out, twenty silent men loaded down with rations, the post surgeon and his wife worked over him. Suddenly the girl broke down. \"Oh!\" she cried. \"Look at his poor hands and knees! Oh, Will, what did that to him?\" \"What?\" stuttered the young surgeon gruffly. \"What! Why, the—the nervy son—son of a gun walked on \u0027em, God knows how far, that\u0027s all! Fill those water bottles, will you. And hurry up.\" Two days later Sullivan opened his eyes, and stared wonderingly at the room, and the lamplight, and the olla hanging in the window, and the post surgeon\u0027s pretty wife, who sat beside his cot. At last his eyes rested on his own hands, shapeless in bandages. And as he looked at them his lips trembled, and he began to cry, weakly, like a child. The post surgeon\u0027s wife thought she understood, and her own breath caught. She was very new to the Army, and she was trying to make a hero of Sullivan. \"Poor fellow,\" she murmured, \"I know they\u0027re bad. But we\u0027ll fix them up. Don\u0027t cry about them.\" \"I ain\u0027t c-cryin\u0027!\" Sullivan whispered, in tremulous indignation. \"I\u0027m l-laughin\u0027. I reckon,\" he muttered, and a ripple of the old whimsicality swept across his face, \"I must be about th\u0027 first man ever wore his hands to a blister, walkin\u0027.\" The wonder of the thought held him entranced. The girl thought he was light-headed. \"Is there anything you\u0027d like?\" she asked soothingly. Sullivan considered. \"Salt,\" he announced emphatically. \"I want salt. Ev\u0027ry drop you\u0027ve got in th\u0027 place. What\u0027re you lookin\u0027 at? Salt\u0027s cheap enough, ain\u0027t it? Well, I want some. Seems like I hadn\u0027t had no salt f\u0027r years.\" How the relief party did its work is another story, and a brave one. It is hard to kill strong men by exhaustion, and, by the time Sullivan could walk a little, the Captain and the other rescued men were sitting up in bed. At last a day came when Burrell was permitted to have one visitor. \"Send Sullivan,\" he ordered. The lanky fellow shuffled in bashfully, and stood with averted eyes. \"Glad to see you\u0027re back, sir,\" he muttered. \"Well,\" asked Burrell gruffly, \"you can shake hands, can\u0027t you?\" Sullivan, grinning sheepishly, held up a muffled paw. \"I reckon not, sir,\" he said. \"What\u0027s the matter with \u0027em?\" the Captain demanded. \"Blistered th\u0027m, sir,\" Sullivan responded with solemn joy. \"Blistered th\u0027m, walkin\u0027.\" \"H\u0027m,\" the Captain muttered. His eyes were burning into the man. \"Sullivan,\" he said abruptly, \"there\u0027s a can of bacon in my haversack that belongs to you.\" Sullivan gulped. Discipline had him by the heels again. \"Beg y\u0027 pardon, sir,\" he mumbled nervously. \"I reckon I must a been sort of loco that day.\" \"Well,\" said the Old Man of B Company gravely, \"maybe I\u0027ll let it go this time. But see it don\u0027t happen again. H\u0027m.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297/90189.html","bookId":454,"book":{"id":454,"title":"The Little Gods","description":"简介： For the life of me, as I was sitting here this sunny, late-October morning, I could not write, a distressing condition, truly, for one who lives by writing....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
