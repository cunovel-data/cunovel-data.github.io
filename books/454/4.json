{"id":25957,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III THE LITTLE MAN","content":"It would be hard to say whether the porter or I was most bewildered by our meeting, for I, mind you, had made a long journey on the mountain with Fermin Majusay, looking for a certain butterfly you wouldn\u0027t be interested in, and had spent a whole night by the fire which Fermin made, while the porter had only to go to the other end of the courtyard of the temple of Tzin Pia?u with his water-jug. Yet we returned from our respective errands at the same moment, and met at the door of my heathen tutor\u0027s cell! The porter came within an ace of letting the jug fall, and I dare say I should have done the same thing, if I had had a jug. The old gentleman looked up at Nang and me, and into us, and through us, with eyes that smiled into vacancy, and at that moment, I think, I first began to entertain some doubts of his complete benevolence. \"Well, Nang,\" purred the old gentleman from his slab, \"what\u0027s the matter with you?\" \"Holy One,\" stammered the porter, \"not two pipes ago I let this gentleman out to go on a long journey. And here he is. And he has not come back, for I barred the gate behind him.\" \"Oh, well, Nang, what difference does that make?\" purred the Holy One, soothingly. \"You may go now.\" The porter went away, shaking his head and muttering, and my heathen priest and I were left alone together. \"And have you had,\" said he, raising himself a little on his hollowed slab, \"an easy and a pleasant journey?\" \"I did not go for pleasure,\" I answered sulkily, for I felt that he was mocking me. \"Ah, yes,\" he answered quickly, \"it was for instruction. I forgot. And did you gain instruction from my Little Gods?\" \"This time you sent me,\" I reminded him, \"to see some Little Devils.\" The spark in his eyes flickered into flame again. \"Did I!\" he murmured, purringly as a cat. \"How I keep forgetting. But after all, it\u0027s merely a matter of names. Did you like what you saw?\" \"No,\" I answered bluntly, \"I did not. Your Little Gods, or your Little Devils, whatever you choose to call them, seem to me the veriest fiends. And cowardly fiends, at that. They catch men like rats, in traps, and drown them, helpless, as men drown rats.\" \"My son,\" purred my old heathen priest, \"I wouldn\u0027t call them cowards, if I were you. They might not like it.\" \"Like it or not,\" said I, hotly, \"they are cowards, if what I\u0027ve seen of them is a fair sample of their ways. Do they never give a man a fair chance, in the open, to fight for his life, and for things dearer to him than life?\" \"For life and things dearer than life,\" echoed my old heathen priest, and yawned, ever so slightly, and stretched his old legs out on his slab. \"Dear me, I don\u0027t see why they shouldn\u0027t. Though of course I know nothing about it. Suppose,\" he suggested, \"you look that up for yourself. I dislike to seem selfish, but really this is an hour which I invariably devote to a nap.\" He made a little imperative, dismissing gesture with his hand, and— \"An\u0027 this,\" says big Terry Clancy, reaching over and getting a grip on the little man\u0027s collar, \"this is our Scuts, the married man.\" I never served in a company yet—and I\u0027ve served in so many, first and last, that I\u0027ll never do anything else—I never served in a company yet that didn\u0027t have a bully and a fool in it. You can always tell them. No one ever dares to cuss out the bully, and somebody is all the time cussin\u0027 out the fool. In the old company the bully was Clancy, relieving me, as Special Orders says. We had some argument about it at first, being about of a size and the biggest men there, but Terry was younger than me, and he relieved me. The fool was a poor little yellow dog that we called Scuts. I don\u0027t even remember his name. He was the most helpless, discouraged, weak-eyed little hombre the sun ever dodged behind a cloud to keep from shining on. Worse than that, he had cold feet. All through the China campaign he was so scared he needn\u0027t have been afraid at all. A bullet couldn\u0027t hit such a little wrinkled, pinched-up thing as he was, even if it wanted to. But of course he got it worse than if he\u0027d been just plain fool. The company don\u0027t stand for cold feet. Even the officers got to jollyin\u0027 about him. \"The little man,\" the Captain always called him. \"H\u0027m,\" grunts the Captain, the day we was getting it so bad in front of Tientsin. One of them club-footed Chinese bullets had just bored through his leg, and it looked like he\u0027d bleed to death before the Doctor could fix him up. \"H\u0027m. Artery gone, you say? Where\u0027s the little man? He\u0027s just about the size to crawl in and hang onto it till you\u0027re ready to tie it. H\u0027m.\" It was the boys telling that to each other, and the Old Man\u0027s sending down the line afterwards to know if anybody had the makings of a cigarette, that kept the company from breaking that day, I reckon. We got it hard. If the Old Man had been with us after that, Scuts would sure have had to go. But he being in hospital, the Lieutenant just took the whole outfit with him, the part that could walk, anyway, and Scuts went back to Manila with us, and down to Samar. \"An\u0027 this,\" says Terry, picking Scuts off the bench and shaking him careless, like he was a rag baby, \"is the idol of his company, the bold bad soldier lad that won the heart an\u0027 tuba-stand of the prettiest little brown girl in Samar. Boys,\" says he, spinning the little man round with a thumb and finger in the back of his neck, \"let me present the husband of the beauteous Marie. Bow to the gentlemen, Scutsy.\" \"Aw, lemme go, Terry,\" says Scuts, blushing pink inside of his yellow skin, and grinning like a puppy that\u0027s just been kicked. \"Aw, you lemme go.\" \"You set down, Scuts,\" says Terry, spinning him round again and laying him on the bench. \"Set down an\u0027 tell us all about it. Give us a tip. We\u0027re all wantin\u0027 to know how you did it. We might want to get married ourselves some day.\" \"Aw, you gwan,\" says Scuts, twistin\u0027 round, with that little damp grin of his. \"You\u0027re joshin\u0027 me.\" \"Man,\" says Terry, \"\u0027tis no josh. Honor bright, we\u0027re all envyin\u0027 you gettin\u0027 a fine pretty little girl like that. Eh, Casey?\" he says to me. \"Straight goods,\" says I. \"The little man pulled down a cold hand that deal.\" \"Hear that, Scutsy?\" says Terry. \"Come on, now, and tell us about it.\" \"Aw,\" says Scuts, throwing a chest as big around as my arm, and twisting a few white hairs on his upper lip, which was his way of wagging his tail, \"Aw,\" he says, \"Marie, aw—I kind of helped her keepin\u0027 her books, y\u0027 know, showin\u0027 her how to spell the boys\u0027 names an\u0027 all that business, an\u0027 we got to be pretty good friends. An\u0027 one day she says to me, \u0027Scuts, all the girls but me has got American man, an\u0027 they laugh at me,\u0027 she says. \u0027Scuts, I want a \u0027Merican man myself.\u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 I says, never thinkin\u0027 of myself, \u0027I\u0027ll tell the boys.\u0027 \u0027Scuts,\u0027 she says, \u0027I got plenty dinero sellin\u0027 tuba to the boys, an\u0027 I likes you. You be my man.\u0027 Aw,\" says Scuts, twistin\u0027 the hairs, \"I looked at her, an\u0027 I seen she was pretty fair-lookin\u0027, so I says, \u0027All right, Marie.\u0027 An\u0027 I ain\u0027t ashamed of it, neither,\" says Scuts, looking round with his big blue eyes, as the crowd begins to laugh. \"She\u0027s \u0027bout th\u0027 nicest girl in this town, I reckon,\" Scuts says. \"Scuts, you gobble the pot,\" says Terry, twisting him off the bench. \"You run along to Marie right now, an\u0027 tell her to be sure and wrap a blanket round you before she puts you to bed. Wouldn\u0027t that beat hell, now,\" he says to us, watching the little man trot off down-town. \"They\u0027re all alike,\" he says. \"Give a white one fifty plunks to buy a dog, an\u0027 she\u0027ll come back with a blear-eyed, knock-kneed pug, and give a brown one a chance at th\u0027 company, an\u0027 she picks out Scuts. Marie\u0027s a good, girl, too. That\u0027s th\u0027 worst of it. Th\u0027 better they are th\u0027 less they know,\" says Terry, \"an\u0027 by th\u0027 time they get all th\u0027 sabe they need, nobody\u0027d take th\u0027m for a gift. Who\u0027s comin\u0027 over in th\u0027 grove an\u0027 drink a cocoanut?\" This was along before Balangiga, and things were running easy, the Old Man being still in hospital, and the Lieutenant being only a boy. A straight boy he was, but not sure yet how he ought to take us. The country was quiet and the people friendly as bugs, and we got careless. About half the boys was sleepin\u0027 out of quarters off and on, and the Top didn\u0027t say anything. I don\u0027t blame him. Of course me and Terry and a lot of other old-timers didn\u0027t go in for that way of doing business, but it\u0027s different with a boy. The only home he has while he\u0027s in the service is the kind he can make by hanging up his hat and ordering the drinks, and he takes it pretty rough if you don\u0027t let him have that in a place like the Philippines. So we went drifting along with only two sentries posted, and the quarters half empty every night, never looking for any trouble. But one afternoon Scuts came trotting in, looking as yellow as Durham, and had a hablar with the Top, and then they both went across to the Lieutenant\u0027s quarters. They didn\u0027t come out till just before Assembly went for Retreat, and we smelled something. Sure enough, orders was read to keep magazines loaded, carry two hundred rounds in the belt, and not be absent from quarters between sunset and sunrise. Soon as we were dismissed, we got after Scuts. \"The natives had it fixed to rush us at night,\" he says. \"Marie tipped me off. She told me not to be out of quarters to-night, an\u0027 th\u0027 Top, he figured out the rest,\" says Scuts, shortsighting, you might say, out into the underbrush as if he expected to see a gang of bolomen, and holding tight to his rifle. \"An\u0027 th\u0027 lady, she had another friend,\" sings out Piggy O\u0027Neil. The crowd laughs, and Scuts turns a dirty pink again. \"Aw,\" he says, \"she wouldn\u0027t tell me no lie. She\u0027s a good straight girl.\" Then we began to debate it, the way we always do in the Army, if it\u0027s only a question of how far it is from New York to the moon, and finally everybody called everybody else a liar and we went to sleep. In the morning everything was quiet and peaceful, so after drill the crowd was beginning to jolly Scuts for fair, when the operator stuck his head out of the window. \"Come up here, some of you, for God\u0027s sake,\" he says, and we didn\u0027t stop to ask questions. He was bending over his ticker, white as a sheet. \"I\u0027m a fool, all right,\" he says, \"but this is sure gettin\u0027 on my nerve. There was a message started to go through from Balangiga ten minutes ago, and all to once— Hear that!\" he says. The machine gave a jerky little chatter. \"It\u0027s like a man sendin\u0027 in his sleep,\" says the operator. \"For ten mortal minutes that thing has been stuttering halves of words.\" \"Who is it?\" asks Terry. \"Murphy\u0027s sendin\u0027,\" says the operator. \"Then he\u0027s jokin\u0027 with ye,\" says Terry. \"Billy always was a great hand for his—\" \"Huh?\" grunts the operator, bending over, as she begun to stutter again. \"What\u0027s he saying?\" somebody asked, but the operator didn\u0027t seem to hear him. Then all at once he began to talk in a voice that didn\u0027t belong to him. \"Balangiga,\" he read, \"seven-ten A.M. Company—attacked by—bolomen—while at—breakfast. Rifles in quarters. Fought with—dishes and—knives and forks—but—no good—\" \"Fought with--dishes and--knives and forks.\" \"Fought with—dishes and—knives and forks.\" \"God!\" says somebody, and a dozen say, \"Shut up.\" But the operator didn\u0027t seem to mind. \"Look out for—yourselves,\" he read. And then he begun to call out a list of names, very slow, and between each one you could hear the crowd draw a long breath. \"Sullivan—Brewster—Fleishart—Nickerson—\" \"Is that Tommy Nickerson?\" says somebody. \"Shut up,\" says Terry. \"But Tommy was my bunky for three—\" \"—Slavin—\" reads the operator—\"Kelly—Hunt—\" and so he goes on, Terry checking off till we thought he never would stop. \"Fourty-five, fourty-six, fourty-seven, fourty-eight,\" he says. Then the machine stopped talking. \"That\u0027s all,\" says Terry. \"Fourty-eight good men that they\u0027ve killed—\" \"Huh?\" grunts the man again, and then the machine began to click very slow, and the operator\u0027s eyes bulged out of his head. \"Murphy!\" he says. \"Christ,\" he says, \"it can\u0027t be Murphy. Murphy\u0027s sendin\u0027. Billy,\" he says, jabbing at his key and then listening. The machine clicked once or twice and then stopped. The operator turns round to us. \"It\u0027s Billy,\" he says. \"Billy\u0027s been sendin\u0027 this, an\u0027 he\u0027s dead.\" The big fellow just dropped down on his table and cried. We looked at him and we looked at each other, and then we went down-stairs on tiptoe, like there was a dyin\u0027 man in the house. \"Fourty-nine,\" says Terry, whispering like—\"fourty-nine men of the regiment killed at breakfast, with no show to help themselves. God! And we might a got the same thing only—Scuts,\" he says, \"where\u0027s that little woman o\u0027 yours?\" \"Warn\u0027t she straight?\" says Scuts, throwing his chest. \"You poor fool,\" Terry shouts, \"go and get her up here before those devils suspect she told us. Take your rifle, damn you,\" he says, as the little man trotted off. \"Fourty-nine o\u0027 them killed fightin\u0027 with their mess-kits. God!\" Just as we was getting into our kits, Scuts comes back. \"I can\u0027t find her,\" he says. \"I ast her mother, an\u0027 she just grinned at me,\" he says, staring out of the window as if he expects to see her there. \"I can\u0027t find her,\" he says. \"Terry, do you s\u0027pose—\" \"Scuts,\" Terry yells at him, \"you get ready to go out on this patrol with us. Do you hear, or have I got to bat you?\" he says, like he meant it. We scouted down through the town, the people smiling at us just as friendly as ever, and never a sign of Marie could we get. So we swung out through the paddies and circled the town, coming back toward the quarters through the grove of cocoa-palms. The Lieutenant was on the point, and all at once he stopped short. We pushed up, and there, tied to a big palm-tree, was something I\u0027ve tried hard to forget. \u0027Twouldn\u0027t have been so bad if she had just been dead, but all at once she— \"They cut her all to pieces an\u0027 it didn\u0027t kill her,\" says Scuts, surprised like. The Lieutenant pulls his gun. \"Right or wrong, I can\u0027t stand that,\" he says, and fires. The little man never flinched at the report. \"They cut her all to pieces, an\u0027 it didn\u0027t kill her,\" he says again, kind of like a phonograph. \"You get out of here, Scuts,\" says Terry, grabbing him by the shoulder and whirling him round. \"You leave me be,\" whines the little man. \"God!\" he says. \"Cut her like that, an\u0027 it didn\u0027t kill her! An\u0027 her such a soft little thing—\" \"Damn you, Scuts,\" says Terry, \"will you cut it out, or have I got to break your head?\" \"Aw, you lemme alone,\" whines Scuts, meek as ever. \"I\u0027m a goin\u0027, ain\u0027t I?\" And he turns and trots back to quarters, never saying another word. When we told the boys, there was cursing like you won\u0027t hear often outside the service, but after Terry had took them out in the grove in squads of half a dozen, they just stopped talking and sat down quiet in the sun, cleaning their rifles and looking at the town over across the parade. All at once, a rifle cracked, and a native over there cut for cover like a hen. The Lieutenant came running down. \"Whose gun was that?\" he asks. Old John Slattery, the oldest man in the company, with twenty-eight years in, gets up slow and stiff, and salutes. \"Mine, sir,\" he says. \"I was workin\u0027 the cartridges out of the magazine, an\u0027 she must\u0027ve gone off accidental.\" The boy just looks at us for about a minute. \"The next one of you that fires a shot without orders,\" he says, \"will stand up against the convent wall there in front of a squad, if I\u0027m the only man in the squad. When the time comes,\" he says, \"you\u0027ll have all the shooting you want. Until then, you\u0027ll leave the natives alone, or you\u0027ll have to kill me.\" It was hard holding in, thinking of Marie over there among the palm-trees, and the boys in Balangiga, and Billy Murphy making his little speech over the wire; but the Lieutenant was right, and when the orders did come, we didn\u0027t have any kick coming about the way he let us carry them out. It was the roughest little old fighting I\u0027ve ever been through. You\u0027d naturally thought the little man would brace up and get into it, after seeing what he\u0027d seen. But he just got peakeder and meeker every day. Seemed like he was half asleep, and only woke up long enough to talk about his dreams. And his talk was enough to drive you loco. One night we\u0027d just come into camp, when Terry pitched his rifle away and dug for his boot as fast as he could. \"Damn that ant,\" he says. \"Who\u0027d think a little thing like that could bite worse\u0027n a good big horse-fly?\" \"Terry,\" says Scuts, \"how do you reckon it feels to have millions of red ants crawlin\u0027 all over you, an\u0027 you all cut an\u0027—\" \"Damn you, Scuts,\" says Terry, reaching for him and cuffing him, \"will you shut up?\" At last one day we ran into them in full force in a little meadow that was broken up with clumps of bamboo and tall grass. We started firing in close order, for it\u0027s dangerous to get spread out in country like that, when you\u0027re fighting men with knives. But after a while, them rushing first one side of the line and then the other, and us getting after them with the bayonet, we opened out. Finally we got \u0027em going just like we wanted \u0027em, in bunches. We\u0027d fire as they ran till they had to drop into cover, and then we\u0027d rush \u0027em with the bayonet and butt. It was the easiest sort of going, more like chasing rabbits than men, and when the recall blowed we had only five men missing, Scuts among them. The Lieutenant sent out half a dozen of us to hunt them up, and in a little hollow, \u0027way ahead of where anybody else had gone, we found the little man lying curled up on his face looking comfortable, the way a man that\u0027s been killed quick most always does. Around him there was a heap of dead natives, no wounded ones. Terry turned him over. He had a bolo in his hand, and he was smiling his little weak-eyed smile. \"The son of a gun!\" says Terry, gulping. \"The damn little son of a gun! What the hell are you fellers standin\u0027 there for?\" he says to us, picking up the little man and laying him over his shoulder. \"There\u0027s four other lads you\u0027ve got to find before sundown.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297/90183.html","bookId":454,"book":{"id":454,"title":"The Little Gods","description":"简介： For the life of me, as I was sitting here this sunny, late-October morning, I could not write, a distressing condition, truly, for one who lives by writing....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
