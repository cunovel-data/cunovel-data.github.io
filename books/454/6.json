{"id":25959,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V THE SUPERFALOUS MAN","content":"I came back, but I am not certain that I had ever left the old temple of Tzin Pia?u. I roused, then, but I am not sure that I had been asleep. However it may have been, I was conscious of being there in the temple of Tzin Pia?u for a moment, long enough to observe that my old heathen priest, half reclining on his slab, was thoughtfully fingering a hard lump in his girdle, just over the pit of his stomach. But the moment he saw me looking at him, he made an imperative little gesture, and— \"Tell th\u0027 Professor that other one, Casey,\" a husky voice commanded. \"You know. Th\u0027 day we lost th\u0027 friend o\u0027 Sly\u0027s.\" Thereupon the even, drawling, dryly humorous voice began to speak. This is what it said this time: \"An\u0027 then Terry says, \u0027You\u0027re too skinny to fight, an\u0027 you ain\u0027t big enough to kill, an\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t feel much lonesome if you was somewheres else. You\u0027re what I call superfalous.\u0027\" The voice dwelt on the magnificent polysyllable lovingly. \"An\u0027 th\u0027 mayreen hobo, he lays his head down on th\u0027 table an\u0027 weeps some weeps into his glass. It was empty. It always was. \u0027That\u0027s th\u0027 wye it gaos with me,\u0027 he says. \u0027I can\u0027t never myke no friends. F\u0027r twenty year I\u0027ve been sylin\u0027 th\u0027 seas fr\u0027m the North Paole to th\u0027 South, fr\u0027m th\u0027 East Paole to th\u0027 West, chysin meridiums fr\u0027m wyve to wyve, lookin\u0027 f\u0027r a friend. But ev\u0027rywhere I gaos—\u0027 \"\u0027Hell,\u0027 says Terry, \u0027if you feel that bad about it, we\u0027ll have one more. Casey,\u0027 he says to me, \u0027is they an East Pole? It sounds reas\u0027nable, some way.\u0027 An\u0027 then,\" the voice mused blissfully, \"we had th\u0027 tamarin\u0027 cocktails, an\u0027 then we went to ride with the accidental caraboo. That was a batty day.\" \"Ain\u0027t I never told you about that day?\" Suddenly the voice was coy. \"Oh, I don\u0027t dast to tell,\" it murmured. \"Local 23 o\u0027 th\u0027 Christian Temp\u0027rance union\u0027ll be gettin\u0027 after me f\u0027r makin\u0027 it look like th\u0027 Army still drunk. I don\u0027t want to spread no false impressions. Ev\u0027rybody knows that since th\u0027 vile canteen was took away, an\u0027 we was give a real chance to lead th\u0027 sinful life, there ain\u0027t one soldier in ten would even pass a saloon, willin\u0027ly. No, sir,\" the voice remarked thoughtfully, \"I don\u0027t reckon there\u0027s more\u0027n one in twenty in th\u0027 whole Army would let a s\u0027loon get by him, if he had to walk a mile out of his road. \"Who this superfalous man was,\" said the voice, \"I don\u0027 know. An\u0027 where we was, I\u0027ve been tryin\u0027 to find out ever since. We started in on beer, but we switched to th\u0027 tamarin\u0027 cocktails, an\u0027 we ended in th\u0027 Lord knows what. Don\u0027t you never drink a tamarin\u0027 cocktail, \u0027nless you want Local 23 startin\u0027 a grand guard patrol across your trail. \"That day begun,\" the voice continued, \"with a terrible painful talk me an\u0027 Terry had with th\u0027 Old Man. It was th\u0027 summer we laid in Maniller after th\u0027 Samar campaign, an\u0027 me an\u0027 Terry an\u0027 the Irishman named Schleimacher had that patriotic go with th\u0027 gu-gu theayter. That coincident shook the Old Man\u0027s faith in us way down to th\u0027 roots, an\u0027 f\u0027r weeks afterwards he kep\u0027 us doin\u0027 double guard an\u0027 double kitchen police an\u0027 stunts like that till we was all wore out. So this mornin\u0027 we bucks up an\u0027 tells him we needs some more passes an\u0027 a day off. \"\u0027H\u0027m,\u0027 says the Old Man. \u0027If I done my duty by sersiety, you two\u0027d never get out together, less\u0027n one was in a submarine an\u0027 th\u0027 other in a b\u0027loon, and then I\u0027ll bet,\u0027 he says, \u0027you\u0027d manage to get your trails tangled some ways. H\u0027m. Who am I to butt into the stars in their courses and get a sore head? I can\u0027t keep ye in quarters no longer; y\u0027r luck at poker is causin\u0027 too many hard feelin\u0027s. An\u0027 I don\u0027t dass to let ye out sep\u0027rate, f\u0027r each of ye needs th\u0027 other one to bring him home. H\u0027m.\u0027 He gives us th\u0027 passes an\u0027 then, just when we thought we was saved at last, he calls us back. \u0027How much money have ye got, anyway?\u0027 he asts. \"We hates to name th\u0027 size. Th\u0027 cards had run favorable since last pay-day. \"\u0027That had ought to keep ye in fines f\u0027r quite a spell,\u0027 he says, when we told him. \u0027H\u0027m. Give it here. I\u0027ll help ye save it.\u0027 \"We hands over, an\u0027 he peels two skinny little bills off them nice fat rolls. \u0027I\u0027ll let ye have five apiece,\u0027 he says. \u0027That makes three dollars f\u0027r chow, an\u0027 a dollar to hire carrermatters, an\u0027 ten beers apiece. Ten is all ye need. Y\u0027r stummicks is only supposed to hold a pint and a half, anyhow,\u0027 he says. \u0027I\u0027ll send th\u0027 rest of th\u0027 money over to the Adjutant\u0027s safe, where you can get at it handy after summary court to-morrer. H\u0027m.\u0027 \"Poor as we was, we\u0027d a been glad to get away, but he stops us again. \u0027Won\u0027t ye be good this once?\u0027 he says. \u0027I can\u0027t make it out,\u0027 he says, sad-like, to th\u0027 ceilin\u0027. \u0027Here\u0027s Maniller layin\u0027 open before them, with nice long walks stretchin\u0027 out all around her. All kinds of nice long hot walks beckonin\u0027 them out among th\u0027 rice-paddies. An\u0027 th\u0027 Luneta, where they could set and look at th\u0027 ships when they was tired, and kill muskeeters. An\u0027 th\u0027 Y.M.C.A. readin\u0027-room. An\u0027 th\u0027 Lib\u0027ry. H\u0027m. Yet I\u0027m mor\u0027lly certain they\u0027ll pass all them things by on the off side, an\u0027 fetch up in some low groggery, debauchin\u0027 young Engineers and Marines an\u0027 shatterin\u0027 th\u0027 Gover\u0027ment. Why can\u0027t my oldest soldiers ack decent?\u0027 he says, \u0027sos\u0027t I can take some pride in th\u0027m?\u0027 \"\u0027May I ex-plain to th\u0027 Captain, sir?\u0027 asts Terry. \u0027That theayter biznai was an axxident.\u0027 \"\u0027An axxident!\u0027 says the Old Man. \u0027H\u0027m. If you see any axxidents comin\u0027 along to-day, give them the road. They\u0027ll get into just one more axxident,\u0027 he says to th\u0027 ceilin\u0027, \u0027an\u0027 they\u0027ll break my heart an\u0027 then,\u0027 he says, \u0027there\u0027ll be something noticeable doin\u0027. Something noticeable. H\u0027m.\u0027 \"We seen that was no place for us, and we sneaks out like a pair of cats that had got caught in swimmin\u0027. \u0027Did you see his eye?\u0027 I says, when we was safe outside. \u0027It\u0027s up to us to walk cracks to-day.\u0027 \"Terry just grunts, and the silence didn\u0027t really get broken till we\u0027d beat it down Real and was settin\u0027 on a bench in th\u0027 Luneta. Terry spoke first. \u0027Any man that figures up my stummick,\u0027 he says, \u0027at a quart and a half, has got another guess.\u0027 \"\u0027That\u0027s a handsome Chink cattle-boat out by the end of the breakwater,\u0027 I says. \u0027Ain\u0027t she got graceful lines?\u0027 \"\u0027Why,\u0027 asts Terry, scuffin\u0027 away at the gravel under the bench, \u0027didn\u0027t he give us a nickel and ast f\u0027r the change? Whose money is that, anyway?\u0027 \"\u0027That transport\u0027s a picture,\u0027 I says. \u0027If she was on\u0027y a little closer, we could almost see the stripes round her smoke-stack.\u0027 \"\u0027If,\u0027 says Terry, \u0027they was any way of makin\u0027 those dollars stretch, I\u0027d paint a first coat of blood-color all over Maniller, just to show him what I could do. But he got th\u0027 bulge on us when he got th\u0027 cash.\u0027 \"\u0027Get on to the ships,\u0027 says I. \u0027He\u0027ll ast us how they was lookin\u0027.\u0027 \"All to once Terry begins smoothin\u0027 the gravel back with his toe. \u0027Casey,\u0027 he says, \u0027they will stretch! This is the day we walk on our feet and save two dollars carrermatter money. It ain\u0027t such a much, but—an\u0027 then,\u0027 he says, \u0027they\u0027s the chow money. I know a hash-fact\u0027ry where we can get a plate of beans f\u0027r a peseta y media, an\u0027 beans is fillin\u0027. Y\u0027r stummick don\u0027t hold but two quart and a half, anyhow, and you don\u0027t want to overload it. Come on,\u0027 he says, jumpin\u0027 up. \u0027Altogether there\u0027s about seventy-seven beers got by the Old Man. Come on! We must have lost a lot of time.\u0027 \"\u0027As you were,\u0027 I says. \u0027If you take me f\u0027r a low booze-fighter like yourself,\u0027 I says, \u0027you\u0027re much mistaken; and besides,\u0027 I says, \u0027did ye ever hear the Old Man talk like he did this mornin\u0027?\u0027 \"\u0027Onct,\u0027 says Terry. \"\u0027An\u0027 you know what you got,\u0027 I says. \u0027It\u0027s up to you and me to roost high and pull up our feet, f\u0027r if old Ma Trouble gets her claws into us this happy day, th\u0027 Old Man is plannin\u0027 to draw cards, too, and they\u0027re a bad pair to buck. Sabe?\u0027 \"Terry seen I was right, an\u0027 that\u0027s the way we come to land down there on th\u0027 waterfront. Don\u0027t ast me where it was. We walked through about six gates in th\u0027 Walled City and come out on the river, an\u0027 took a canoe and landed somewhere way down on the other side. That\u0027s all I know. There was the place waitin\u0027 for us. Café of the 400 Flags, it says in Spanish over the door, and underneath, in English, Sailor\u0027s Friendly. \"And it was a nice friendly sort of place. We was the only ones there, and after we\u0027d got sat down in a corner by a window, we figured we\u0027d fooled old Ma Trouble f\u0027r once. There warn\u0027t anybody within a mile to lead us astray, an\u0027 we just aimed to set there an\u0027 look at th\u0027 boats on th\u0027 river till we\u0027d had enough, and then go back to Barracks and surprise the Old Man, and make him ashamed of himself. But it warn\u0027t to be. \"We hadn\u0027t been settin\u0027 there more\u0027n half an hour, when that A.O.H. sailorman Schleimacher from Cavite comes in the door, and th\u0027 sorrerful lad was right behind him. It was all off then, on\u0027y we didn\u0027t know it. \"\u0027Ahoy, amigos,\u0027 says Schleimacher. \u0027Well, well, well, if it ain\u0027t the two paytriots! Always sloppin\u0027 round in beer, ain\u0027t you? Don\u0027t go dilutin\u0027 your insides with that stuff. Here, you,\u0027 he yells to the Malay pirate behind the bar, \u0027fetch along th\u0027 thought-remover f\u0027r th\u0027 Se?ors.\u0027 \"\u0027W\u0027isky?\u0027 asts th\u0027 pirate. \"\u0027If that ain\u0027t like a Marine!\u0027 says Terry. \u0027But then you ain\u0027t got a canteen no more, either.\u0027 \"\u0027No, we ain\u0027t, dankum Himmle,\u0027 says Sly, an\u0027 th\u0027 sorrerful sailorman butts in, layin\u0027 his head down on th\u0027 table and cryin\u0027 like a child. \u0027Times ayn\u0027t what they ware,\u0027 he says. \u0027Men don\u0027t drink like they used. Mytes, I remember a dye in Punt\u0027 Arenas, off Tristan d\u0027Acunha—\u0027 \"\u0027Who\u0027s y\u0027r friend, Sly?\u0027 I asts. \"\u0027Damfino,\u0027 says Sly. \u0027He picked me up at th\u0027 Navy landin\u0027. Said my clo\u0027es smelt so salt it made his mouth water. Some lime-juicer on th\u0027 beach, I reckon. No, sir, dankum Himmle, there ain\u0027t no more canteen. When I think,\u0027 Sly says, \u0027of th\u0027 pay I\u0027ve wasted aboard, f\u0027r belly-wash, but now,\u0027 he says, \u0027you don\u0027t hit th\u0027 beach on\u0027y after pay-days, an\u0027 then you\u0027ve got th\u0027 money, an\u0027 you\u0027ve got the thirst, an\u0027 Mine Gott!\u0027 he says, \u0027the load you can get on! No canteens in mine. Fill th\u0027m up. They\u0027s one f\u0027r you, Barnacles, if you can keep the tear-drops out of it.\u0027 \"The guy sat up straight enough, soon as a drink was mentioned, and we got a good look at him. Talk about y\u0027r hoboes! That mayreener looked like he\u0027d been trampin\u0027 it way down on th\u0027 bottom, and hadn\u0027t got around to shakin\u0027 himself and combin\u0027 the shells and seaweed out of his hair. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says Terry, when he\u0027d took him in, \u0027he sure does look superfalous to me.\u0027 \"The guy mops up his drink, an\u0027 lays his head down on th\u0027 table again. \u0027That\u0027s th\u0027 wye it gaos,\u0027 he blatters. \u0027I can\u0027t never myke no friends, and so I gao chysin\u0027 meridiums over the angry wyves. I \u0027ad a friend onct, to Valparaiso, as smart a \u0027and as ever reefed a stuns\u0027l—\u0027 he chokes up so bad he can\u0027t talk. \"\u0027Good Lord, Sly,\u0027 says Terry, \u0027have we got to set around with that all day?\u0027 \"\u0027Chuck him overboard if you want,\u0027 says Sly. \u0027He ain\u0027t mine. But let him stay, and I\u0027ll pay for his. I like a crowd around to kind of keep them movin\u0027.\u0027 \"\u0027I \u0027ad a shipmyte onct off Comorin,\u0027 bleats th\u0027 sorrerful lad, \u0027but \u0027e was lost, steppin\u0027 of th\u0027 bowsprit\u0027—he chokes up. \"\u0027Oh, well,\u0027 says Terry, \u0027if you feel that bad about losin\u0027 him, we\u0027ll have one more. We\u0027ll all pay f\u0027r his rounds, Sly, if he\u0027s broke. On\u0027y, he does look superfalous to me.\u0027 \"I reckon that wanderer must have felt near as bad as he looked! Seemed like he\u0027d been pretty near everywhere once or twice, an\u0027 ev\u0027ry place he remembered, something about it made him cry. We got ust to him after a while, and he just sat with his head among th\u0027 glasses, \u0027ceptin\u0027 when a drink come by. \"Long about noon we got to wonderin\u0027 what we\u0027d better drink next. Th\u0027 thought-remover warn\u0027t workin\u0027 to suit Sly. \u0027Th\u0027 ferry goes at six,\u0027 he says, \u0027an\u0027 I ain\u0027t even got a start yet. Le\u0027s try an\u0027 find somethin\u0027 certain.\u0027 Then th\u0027 weeper looks up. \"\u0027I can\u0027t \u0027ope to myke no friends,\u0027 he says, eyein\u0027 us mournful, \u0027but I can myke a tamarin\u0027 Cocktail. A little lydy down to Macassar learnt me. Mytes, w\u0027en I think of that pore young girl an\u0027 the \u0027orrible wye I lost \u0027er—\u0027 it took two thought-removers to get him sos\u0027t he could tell th\u0027 pirate what bottles to bring f\u0027r th\u0027 cocktail. They made a bunch. Th\u0027 sorrerful lad most looked happy when he saw them. \"\u0027They ayn\u0027t no tamarin\u0027s,\u0027 he says, \u0027but that don\u0027t myke no differunce. Mytes, you\u0027d ought to see th\u0027 tamarin\u0027s at Isle o\u0027 France! W\u0027en I think I\u0027ll never see no tamarin\u0027s like them no more—\u0027 On\u0027y th\u0027 bottles saved him. He took a swig out of the first one he touched. Right there th\u0027 Sorrers o\u0027 Satan lad begun to look fishy to me. Didn\u0027t seem like anybody\u0027d need quite so many drinks to drown anything but a thirst. But I forgot all that when he gave me th\u0027 cocktail. \"\u0027Stead of a kick it had a kind of a pull to it, that drink did, like a b\u0027loon. \u0027Two more of them,\u0027 says Sly, settin\u0027 down his glass, \u0027an\u0027 th\u0027 Cavite ferry can go when it very well pleases. I can walk.\u0027 \"\u0027If so be I \u0027ad a friend,\u0027 says th\u0027 mayreener, sort of proud at th\u0027 way we lapped them up, \u0027they\u0027s nothin\u0027 I\u0027d love better\u0027n to set all dye long mykin\u0027 tamarin\u0027 cocktails for \u0027im.\u0027 I reckon that was no lie. \u0027Mytes,\u0027 says he, \u0027w\u0027en I think I\u0027ll never \u0027ave no real friend to myke th\u0027m for—\u0027 \"\u0027Brace up, Bo,\u0027 says Terry, like a father. Th\u0027 tamarin\u0027s had took holt that quick. \u0027Brace up, old sport. We\u0027re all friends o\u0027 your\u0027n here. Ain\u0027t that so, boys?\u0027 \"\u0027Is it, mytes?\u0027 says th\u0027 mayreener. \u0027Is it? Well, well, I never thought to \u0027ave three friends all to onct! W\u0027en I think of all the \u0027undreds of shipmytes—I\u0027ll be mykin\u0027 up another, mytes.\u0027 \"So Barnacles, he got started makin\u0027 th\u0027m, an\u0027 we got started drinkin\u0027 th\u0027m. So did he. I never seen a drink ack like them. Didn\u0027t seem to have no real effeck, but things just moved away back where they belonged an\u0027 let you alone. And sympathetic! Say, if we could on\u0027y manage to throw a few of them into Local 23, we\u0027d get th\u0027 canteen back. They sure are a funny drink. \u0027Bout th\u0027 sixth, we couldn\u0027t do enough f\u0027r that stranded mayreener. I\u0027d forgot all about his seemin\u0027 fishy, and me an\u0027 Terry an\u0027 Sly hung round him like a bunch of old-maid aunts, givin\u0027 him drinks ev\u0027ry time he remembered anything. He sure had a great mem\u0027ry. \u0027Twarn\u0027t till th\u0027 middle of the afternoon it begun to show signs of givin\u0027 out. An\u0027 then he thinks he wants to have a look at Maniller—sos\u0027t he could remember that, I reckon. \"His legs wouldn\u0027t quite hold him. \u0027Mytes,\u0027 he says, \u0027me knees ayn\u0027t what they ware. W\u0027en I remember them trips to Kerguelen\u0027s Land, down round San Fernando Fo—in them dyes no smarter \u0027and rove a dead-eye or \u0027auled a keel. But now—\u0027 \"\u0027Give him an arm, Casey,\u0027 says Terry. \u0027Can\u0027t you see he ain\u0027t as young as us? Brace up, old sport, we\u0027ll look out f\u0027r you.\u0027 \"So th\u0027 three of us steers th\u0027 sorrerful sailorman out onto th\u0027 muelle, an\u0027 there warn\u0027t a livin\u0027 soul on th\u0027 whole river front but just the accidental caraboo! He was standin\u0027 hitched to a cart, right where old Ma had left him. \"Th\u0027 mayreener breaks down when he sees that caraboo. \u0027A buffalao!\u0027 he blatters. \u0027I ayn\u0027t seen one of them since I was a gye young sheperd—fisherman, on me father\u0027s little farm in th\u0027 valleys—beaches o\u0027 Bengal! Mytes, lead me to th\u0027 buffalao.\u0027 \"\u0027That ain\u0027t a buffalo, sport,\u0027 says Terry. \u0027Buffalos has hair. That\u0027s a caraboo, an\u0027 you don\u0027t want no part of him. They ain\u0027t safe.\u0027 \"\u0027\u0027E\u0027ll not \u0027urt me,\u0027 says th\u0027 mayreener. \u0027Aoh, th\u0027 buffalaos I\u0027ve fed and watered with these \u0027ands in th\u0027 dear old dyes. Lead me to \u0027im, mytes.\u0027 \"We steers him over and he falls on that caraboo\u0027s neck and cries into his ear and blubbers some kind of talk to him: an\u0027 th\u0027 caraboo wriggles his ear an\u0027 waggles his little tail an\u0027 blubbers back. Them two understood each other! It knocked me flat. All my respec\u0027 f\u0027r th\u0027 mayreener comes back. \"\u0027Ay, mytes,\u0027 he bleats, \u0027it mykes me young again to talk with \u0027im. Put us up on th\u0027 cart, mytes.\u0027 \"\u0027Ye can\u0027t drive him, sport?\u0027 says Terry, doubtful. \"\u0027F\u0027r years I done nothink else,\u0027 says th\u0027 mayreener. \u0027Aoh, the old, \u0027appy dyes! Put us up, mytes, an\u0027 pass us th\u0027 nose rope.\u0027 \"\u0027If th\u0027 caraboo kills him,\u0027 says Terry, \u0027it\u0027ll on\u0027y put th\u0027 pore old feller out of his mis\u0027ry.\u0027 So we hists him up an\u0027 gives him th\u0027 nose rope, and there he set cross-legged like a nigger, jerkin\u0027 th\u0027 rope an\u0027 talkin\u0027 caraboo-talk, an\u0027 th\u0027 caraboo goes! Yes, sir, th\u0027 mayreener drives him up an\u0027 down like he\u0027d been born there! I never seen no other white man that could do that. \"\u0027Come aboard, mytes,\u0027 he says, pullin\u0027 up. \u0027We\u0027ll tyke a little turn about th\u0027 taown.\u0027 \"Seems like I heard old Ma Trouble scratchin\u0027 herself somewheres. \u0027You go along an\u0027 help Ma, Terry,\u0027 I says, \u0027an\u0027 I\u0027ll report the axxident to th\u0027 Old Man. When it comes to takin\u0027 a ride with a stolen caraboo an\u0027 a hayseed mayreener fr\u0027m th\u0027 beaches of Bengal—-\u0027 \"\u0027I knowed I couldn\u0027t \u0027ope to \u0027ave three friends,\u0027 says th\u0027 mayreener, doublin\u0027 up an\u0027 cryin\u0027 like a child. It didn\u0027t touch my heart, not hard, but Terry an\u0027 Sly was still full of tamarindy feelin\u0027s. \u0027Don\u0027t spoil th\u0027 pore old feller\u0027s fun,\u0027 they says. \u0027We\u0027ll bring th\u0027 caraboo back, so it ain\u0027t as if we stole him. He\u0027s just borrered.\u0027 \"So I clumb on and we starts, th\u0027 mayreener settin\u0027 an\u0027 jerkin\u0027 th\u0027 rope, and us hangin\u0027 our legs off th\u0027 back of th\u0027 wagon. And by th\u0027 time we\u0027d gone a ways, I begin to like it! It was somethin\u0027 new, an\u0027 then I reckon perhaps th\u0027 joltin\u0027 freshened up my tamarin\u0027s some. Anyhow, th\u0027 houses moved back and made room, an\u0027 th\u0027 people on th\u0027 sidewalks, givin\u0027 us a glad hand an\u0027 a merry ha-ha, sounded far-away an\u0027 soothin\u0027, and when we\u0027d got up to Binondo bridge it seemed so natchral I wasn\u0027t even wonderin\u0027 any more why a copper didn\u0027t pinch us. I don\u0027t sabe that yet, but I reckon old Ma kep\u0027 them off till she got done with us. \"Yes, sir, that ride went fine, till we come to th\u0027 foot of the Escolta. You know what it\u0027s like at that time of day? Jam full! A line of rigs was standin\u0027 along each side of that narrer little old street, and inside of them two more lines was pokin\u0027 along, opposite ways, and in what was left of th\u0027 middle th\u0027 horse-cars was doin\u0027 rapid transit. Didn\u0027t look like you could crowd a thin dog through that mess. \"\u0027Here\u0027s where we turn round, sport,\u0027 says Terry, but it was no use. Th\u0027 mayreener whispers some messages down th\u0027 rope an\u0027 th\u0027 caraboo swings into th\u0027 car-tracks, and next minute there we was plowin\u0027 a road up the Escolta, and no way of backin\u0027 out till we hit the other end, half a mile away. I never felt so conspectuous in my life! Ev\u0027rybody was lookin\u0027. \u0027Tain\u0027t often they see three soldiers caraboo-drivin\u0027 up the Escolta, with old man McGinty at th\u0027 rope! \"We might have made it, I still think, if th\u0027 mayreener had stuck to th\u0027 job. He sure sabed caraboo. But he lays down on us. Yes, sir, right there he just curls up and goes sound asleep! \u0027My watch below, mytes,\u0027 he says. \u0027Relieve th\u0027 w\u0027eel,\u0027 an\u0027 he topples over. Sly grabs th\u0027 rope. \"And away we went! Seems like th\u0027 caraboo knowed something green had took holt. He puts his nose down an\u0027 whoofs an\u0027 swings his head. First wipe th\u0027 tip of a horn catches a chicken-coop wagon, an\u0027 R-r-rip!—th\u0027 spokes is out of a wheel. He swings th\u0027 other way an\u0027 takes a piece of varnish, with th\u0027 wood still on it, of a shiny new victorier. Sly gets mad at that! \"\u0027Clear out of th\u0027 fairway, ye blinkety-blanked-blicked-zinked longshoreman,\u0027 he yells, hittin\u0027 th\u0027 caraboo a crack with the end of th\u0027 rope. Th\u0027 caraboo breaks into a gallop, swingin\u0027 them horns like a scythe, and ev\u0027ry jump Sly hands him another. \u0027Stand by to repel boarders,\u0027 he sings out. \u0027Hit th\u0027 victorier guy in th\u0027 eye if he sets a foot on deck. Wheee-ee-e! Luff up, ahead there, you\u0027re off your course! Luff up! Well, take it, then.\u0027 Zing! Bing! One of our wheels—they was sawed solid off a log four foot through—hits a carrermatter an\u0027 tosses it onto another, and them two piles up some more. \u0027Whee-ee-ee!\u0027 Sly yells. \u0027Hold her as she is! Didn\u0027t carry away nothin\u0027 that trip, did we? Whee-ee-eee!\u0027 \"He lights in with th\u0027 rope and away we goes again, two ton of caraboo and two ton of wagon, both built low, at a dead gallop! Rigs was pilin\u0027 up all around us, an\u0027 horses was kickin\u0027 an\u0027 squealin\u0027, an\u0027 wheels was lockin\u0027 up an\u0027 rippin\u0027 out spokes, an\u0027 cocheros was cussin\u0027 in ten languages. Away back I seen a mounted cop chasin\u0027 us, but Ma had him headed off in that mess. \"And then She sets her claws in! Right ahead of us a carrermatter was streakin\u0027 it hell-bent through an open space, tryin\u0027 to get away. We could see th\u0027 feller in it leanin\u0027 forrard and whalin\u0027 th\u0027 horse. But, Lord, that caraboo\u0027d a run down a thoroughbred. \"\u0027Sheer off to starboard!\u0027 Sly yells. \u0027What do ye mean, loafin\u0027 round th\u0027 channel that way, ye blinkety-bling-blanked son of a mess attendant? I report ye to th\u0027 Captain of th\u0027 Port. To starboard, I tell ye. Port your helm! Hard over! Oh, well,\u0027 he says, \u0027if you want it—Collision bulkheads, boys, I\u0027ll have to ram him. Hold hard, all! Whee-eee-eeee!\u0027 He hits th\u0027 caraboo a couple more, and it seems like we go right through that carrermatter. It just fades away. \u0027Take that!\u0027 yells Sly. \u0027An\u0027 I\u0027ll report ye, besides.\u0027 \"An\u0027 right then, risin\u0027 up out of what had been th\u0027 carrermatter, I seen a short chunky kind of a man, with a tire hung to one ear, and a handful of spokes stickin\u0027 out of one pocket, and a piece of dashboard in one hand. I didn\u0027t see him long, but I seen him awful plain. It was Him! \u0027Looka there!\u0027 I whispers—I couldn\u0027t talk—an\u0027 Terry takes one look, an\u0027 he couldn\u0027t talk. \"An\u0027 then th\u0027 Old Man catches sight of us, an\u0027 he stands up in th\u0027 ruins and shakes th\u0027 piece of dashboard at us. \u0027H\u0027m!\u0027 he says. \u0027H\u0027m-mmm!\u0027 That\u0027s all. He couldn\u0027t talk, neither. \"Right there a street turns off the Escolta, an\u0027 I seen it was then or never. \u0027Sly,\u0027 I says, \u0027can ye turn off here to th\u0027 lef\u0027?\u0027 \"\u0027Sure,\u0027 he says. \u0027Anywheres. He\u0027s steerin\u0027 fine now. Whoop-eee-eeee-ee!\u0027 Zing! Bing! Sly leans back on th\u0027 rope, an\u0027 th\u0027 caraboo puts his nose down, an\u0027 Whoof!—he hits that line of rigs between us an\u0027 th\u0027 road we needed. Talk about football. Two bumps and a hard swaller, an\u0027 we was gallopin\u0027 down that side street, with th\u0027 racket dyin\u0027 away behind us. \"\u0027Keep him goin\u0027, Sly,\u0027 I says. \u0027\u0027Twas th\u0027 Old Man we hit!\u0027 \"\u0027Mine Gott!\u0027 says Sly, and lights in with th\u0027 rope. Th\u0027 caraboo tries to fly, but that didn\u0027t bother us. We wouldn\u0027t a cared if he had. We just hangs on and lets him go it. \"When he did stop it was in front of a s\u0027loon! Funny coincident, warn\u0027t it? We seen there was just one thing to do, an\u0027 th\u0027 mayreener thinks so, too. He slep\u0027 through all that, but th\u0027 minute we was sneakin\u0027 up quiet on a drink he comes to life! \"\u0027\u0027As anythink \u0027appened, mytes?\u0027 he asts. We tells him. \"\u0027Aoh,\u0027 he says, \u0027I do \u0027ope ye \u0027aven\u0027t \u0027urt me buffalao! They\u0027re dillikit creachures, mytes. In the old, \u0027appy dyes—\u0027 he has to cry in th\u0027 caraboo\u0027s ear before he can take his drink. \"Don\u0027t ast me how we spent th\u0027 rest of the afternoon. Ast th\u0027 caraboo; he was boss. We couldn\u0027t steer him none to speak of, but we could start him goin\u0027. He stopped himself. Always in front of a s\u0027loon, too. I\u0027d like to see th\u0027 guy that owned him. \"An\u0027 ev\u0027ry time he stopped, th\u0027 mayreener would wake up an\u0027 mix a tamarin\u0027 cocktail an\u0027 have a weep. His mem\u0027ry was workin\u0027 fine again. An\u0027 so we follered th\u0027 trail of that intemp\u0027rate caraboo through all th\u0027 back streets of Maniller, wanderin\u0027 on fr\u0027m one low haunt of vice to another till the houses moved back where they belonged again, an\u0027 th\u0027 sun got nice and hot and shiny, and even th\u0027 Old Man didn\u0027t seem to matter—much—an\u0027 we went to sleep on th\u0027 cart, still wanderin\u0027. \"When I woke up, Sly was gone, but Terry and th\u0027 mayreener was still poundin\u0027 their ears, and th\u0027 caraboo was still walkin\u0027, quiet, like he was loafin\u0027 home with his dinner-pail and pipe after a hard day\u0027s work, along a road between some rice-paddies. Things looked new to me and I set up and took a look. We was lost! Th\u0027 sun was settin\u0027 \u0027way over across th\u0027 paddies, and there warn\u0027t no Maniller in sight, nor nothin\u0027 but just th\u0027 paddies and th\u0027 road—and us. And I warn\u0027t sure whether it was yestidday or to-morrer! I felt so lonesome I woke Terry up. \"We set lookin\u0027 round a spell, and things begun to come back to us. \u0027Old Ma cert\u0027nly hooked th\u0027m in this time,\u0027 I says. \u0027Th\u0027 Old Man\u0027s heart is broke now, all right. Did ye spot th\u0027 look in his eye when he reco\u0027nized us? That spelt G.C.M. to me.\u0027 \"\u0027Th\u0027 carrermatter was just an axxi—\u0027 Terry stops short. \u0027I donno,\u0027 he says, \u0027but what it would be safer to desert.\u0027 \"\u0027Maybe we\u0027ve deserted a\u0027ready,\u0027 I says. \u0027Lord knows how long we\u0027ve overstayed our leave. I feel like I\u0027d slep\u0027 a month.\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027ve got a head, too,\u0027 says Terry. \u0027It was them tamarin\u0027 cocktails done it. Swelp me if I ever drink another drink.\u0027 \"That hits th\u0027 mayreener. \u0027Lead me to it, mytes,\u0027 he says, sleepy. \u0027Me legs ayn\u0027t what they ware, but lead me to it.\u0027 \"\u0027That\u0027s what done it,\u0027 I says to Terry. \"Terry looks at th\u0027 mayreener a spell. \u0027Casey,\u0027 he says, \u0027you\u0027re right. He done it, th\u0027 shrimp. It was him invented th\u0027 tamarin\u0027s, and him st— borrered th\u0027 caraboo, and him went to sleep on the Escolta. And us aimin\u0027 to ack decent, an\u0027 gettin\u0027 th\u0027 Old Man to save our money for us. Th\u0027 cock-eyed old cod-fish!\u0027 says Terry, eyein\u0027 th\u0027 slumberin\u0027 mayreener. \u0027I\u0027d like to bat his head off. Swelp me if ever I drink another—\u0027 \"\u0027Mytes,\u0027 th\u0027 mayreener begins, but Terry claps a hand over his mouth. \u0027What\u0027ll we do to him, Casey?\u0027 he says. \"\u0027Le\u0027s think,\u0027 I says. \"Th\u0027 caraboo was still loafin\u0027 along with his pick and shovel over his shoulder, and we sets and looks at him, and th\u0027 mayreener, and th\u0027 paddies, thinkin\u0027. It was gettin\u0027 pretty near dark, and \u0027way ahead of us was some mountains th\u0027 caraboo looked to be makin\u0027 for. Then th\u0027 plan come to us. \"\u0027Give us th\u0027 rope, Casey,\u0027 Terry says. \u0027He might roll off \u0027n muddy his cloes.\u0027 They was a coil of pack-rope on th\u0027 cart, and we takes and rolls th\u0027 mayreener all up in it and fastens him to th\u0027 cart, all safe and sound. He never yips till we\u0027re settin\u0027 th\u0027 last knot. \u0027Three friends,\u0027 he says. \u0027Mytes, I never thought to \u0027ave—\u0027 \"\u0027Friends!\u0027 says Terry. \u0027Friends! Ain\u0027t he got a nerve!\u0027 \"We drops off behind and leaves him and his buffalao to jog along. It was gettin\u0027 dark, but we set down and watched them out of sight. They was passin\u0027 out of our lives slow but sure, joggin\u0027 along, him and his buffalao. \"\u0027There may be ladrones in them mountains,\u0027 I says. \"\u0027Ladrones,\u0027 says Terry, \u0027wouldn\u0027t bother him. He\u0027s too superfalous f\u0027r ladrones.\u0027 \"It got darker and darker, and pretty soon old Mr. Caraboo grunts up over a little rise and they was gone. \u0027Well,\u0027 says Terry, \u0027if he ever does get back, he\u0027ll have somethin\u0027 real to remember this time. Come along, Casey.\u0027 \"So we hits th\u0027 road. We reckoned if we follered it long enough, we prob\u0027ly strike some place. So we plugs along through th\u0027 dark. We warn\u0027t worryin\u0027 none about Schleimacher. Nothin\u0027 ever happens to a full-blooded Marine, anyhow, and we had other things to think about. \"\u0027Did ye notice th\u0027 tire round his neck?\u0027 I says. \u0027That tire\u0027ll cost us a mont\u0027 extry.\u0027 \"Terry grunts. \u0027Considerin\u0027 th\u0027 months we\u0027ll get anyhow,\u0027 he says, disgusted-like, \u0027an extry one is what I\u0027d call superfalous.\u0027 \"And so,\" the voice concluded thoughtfully, \"we plugs along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297/90185.html","bookId":454,"book":{"id":454,"title":"The Little Gods","description":"简介： For the life of me, as I was sitting here this sunny, late-October morning, I could not write, a distressing condition, truly, for one who lives by writing....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
