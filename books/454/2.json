{"id":25955,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I FAGAN","content":"I found myself \"up the railroad,\" as we used to say, in a well-remembered town. It had not changed since I saw it last. The railroad still ran through it, straight as a pencil-stroke ruled across the flat lands, and the rails, on their embankment, shimmered in the sun like two unending bars of white-hot metal. The cart road still wallowed into it, and out of it, for the town is set on an island in the marshy level of the paddies. The crazy huts of nipa, and crazier, decaying houses, still stood thick on either side of the one street. And brown women in skirts of gaudy calico still sat under the shadow of wide shutters, dispensing such goods as Poverty can buy, while their babies and their pigs rolled comfortably together in the dust. The shaggy thatch still rustled in the sultry breeze, and a few dejected palm-trees clicked their branches as of old. And, very far away across the waveless green sea of the half-grown rice, the same dark and threatening mountains towered into the clouds. It was all unchanged. The merciless sun struck down just as hotly. The very smells were smells I had often smelled before. Suddenly there was a stir of excitement in the town. The women crawled from the litter of their wares. The men, lighting fresh cigarettes from the remnants of their old ones, stood up to gaze. For down the street was coming, with the curious in-toeing shuffle of a barefoot mountaineer, a squat, huge-muscled, naked man. He carried a long, broad-bladed spear in his right hand, and a head-axe was thrust through his belt, and at his back a bag, swollen as if it held something big and round, bobbed and dangled heavily, and something dripped from it slowly, thickly, in the dust. The man\u0027s broad, sweat-streaked face was all agrin with excitement and good-nature, but the natives of the town shrank back from him as he passed. \"Donde \u0027Mericanos?\" he kept asking eagerly. A bystander pointed to a house, one a little taller than the others, where a flag of dingy white, barred with dingier red and blue, hung drooping, and a group of tall, lean, sun-bronzed men dressed in frayed shirts of blue flannel, and breeches of stained and faded khaki, and battered campaign hats, were lounging in the dusty shade. The bystander pointed to them, and the naked man, his face stretching in a wider grin, broke into a clumsy trot and ran to them. \"Me got,\" he said, and pulled the heavy, bobbing bag from his shoulders, and thrust it at them. They fell back hastily. \"It\u0027s something, all right,\" said one of them judicially. \"Something plenty dead. Sergeant,\" he called, \"I reckon it\u0027s your deal. Here\u0027s an Igaroot with another dead-head lookin\u0027 for you.\" And the others laughed. At that an oldish man with a long, drooping, gray moustache, and gray eyes that were bright below their sun-burned lids, stepped from the door. The naked man cried out again, \"Me got,\" and held out his dripping bag. And the saturnine old sergeant fell back, as the men had done. \"You open it, Johnnie,\" he commanded. \"It\u0027s too dead for me. Patay, sabe? Me no likum thataway. Icao abieria.\" So the man undid the string that bound his bag, and opened it, and the sergeant took one peep inside. \"It\u0027s a big American nigger, all right,\" he announced. \"And he\u0027s sure dead. It might be him. Better call the Captain over here, some one; I don\u0027t reckon he wants that in his quarters. Where you catch him, hombre?\" The little man jerked his chin over his shoulder at those distant mountains. \"You buy?\" he asked anxiously. \"You\u0027ll get the reward all right, if it\u0027s him,\" said the sergeant reassuringly. \"But you\u0027ll have to wait till it\u0027s identified. There\u0027ve been a lot of duplicates brought in, sabe.\" Presently other men in khaki and flannel, who in spite of their undress showed, somehow, as officers, came down the street, and they, and the sergeant, and the man with the bag, went into the house. After a long wait, an orderly came out, pale and shaken, and turned toward the military telegraph station. \"It\u0027s him,\" he said briefly, to his waiting fellows. \"That Contract Dentist in there knowed him by his teeth. God! I\u0027m plumb glad I ain\u0027t no kind of medico.\" The men looked at each other, silently, for a long minute. The spirit of jesting seemed to have left them. The judicial one spoke first. \"Well, he got his good and hard at last,\" said he. \"But he sure got a run for his money.\" Then I understood what it was all about. I wrote of that thing in the bag once, not knowing it then for a pawn in the Game of the Little Gods. There was a time when men called it Fagan. While Fagan was still a kinky-haired youngster, clad only in the traditional shirt, a question forced itself on his attention. \"Why ain\u0027t I got a pappy?\" he asked his mother, and the great, deep-bosomed woman laughed the deep, melodious laugh of her race. \"Lawszee, honey, I raickon you has,\" she replied. \"Mos\u0027 chillen has.\" \"Who is my pappy?\" the child persisted. The woman laughed again. \"Lawszee, chile, how you spaik me to \u0027maimber that? I\u0027se got other things to \u0027maimber, I raickon.\" We couldn\u0027t expect much of a Fagan, born of that race and class, and he learned not to expect much of us. A bit of food, a bit of clothing, and a chance to roll around on the levee with the other pickaninnies, and bask in the sunshine and sniff the sweety-sour smells from the sugar-ships, sufficed him. For many years these pleasures were his for the taking. And as he grew older they still sufficed, with the addition of a little cheap tobacco and cheaper gin, and he found that a modicum of labor and a care never to offend one of the heaven-born white race would procure them. The labor was easy, for the son of the deep-bosomed, supple-limbed woman had grown, as the rank, free growth of a swamp shoots up, into a great, broad, graceful man to whom the toil of others was mere play. And he was of a nature so easy-going and joyous and childishly obliging that the heaven-born pointed him out with approval as \"a nigger like we had before the war.\" He might have lived on thus indefinitely, but one day, over a lazy roll of the dice, another black man took advantage of his known good nature. And Fagan, the kindly, felt a sudden, blinding impulse to strike. The huge black fist shot out like lightning under the impulse of the supple, writhing muscles, and the other man dropped with a broken neck. Then Fagan came to the Army, and the Army received him with joy. The surgeon\u0027s eye glistened with an artist\u0027s fervor as he thumped and kneaded the great, perfect animal, and a wise old recruiting sergeant guided the pen for him to sign his name. Thus he was made welcome in that most catholic of societies, which cares not a whit for your past, your present, or your future, so long as you have mind and body sufficient to obey orders. But even this slight requirement was much for Fagan. His careless, soapless, buttonless existence was a poor training for the rigid minuti? of military life. And he was unfortunate in his immediate commander. Most of the officers of the Fifty-fourth were of the South, able to deal firmly yet kindly with the big black children committed to their charge. But Sharpe was new to the Army, the son of a small tradesman in the North, and had an exalted reverence for the Regulations, and his own rank. So when he saw that the buttons of Fagan\u0027s blouse were uncleaned, one morning at guard-mounting, he did not announce the fact impersonally, as an officer should. And Fagan, in serene ignorance of any law against immediate explanation, replied with boyish, surprised chuckle, \"Lawszee, Lootenant, I raickon I plumb forgot them buttons.\" \"That\u0027s enough,\" snapped the officer. \"Sergeant, put this man under arrest.\" Fagan followed to the guard-house, mildly expostulant. \"He suah\u0027d orter give me a fairah show,\" he said to the sergeant. \"I was jus\u0027 a gwine to tell him. I didn\u0027t mean no hahm. All I wanted was a fayah show.\" \"All I wanted was a fayah show.\" \"All I wanted was a fayah show.\" Thus began a series of petty persecutions. Fagan, with his good nature, tried his best, but the Lieutenant would not be pleased. He was not a bad sort in intent, simply a common, weak, official bully. Such men usually resign early, or if they linger on in the service, learn to shun getting in front of their men when there is firing. By the time the regiment was ordered to the Philippines Fagan\u0027s record loomed black with five trials. But the campaigning brought relief. A man was required only to have his rifle in good condition, and be on hand to use it. The regiment spent weary days, dragging about like a slow snake under the burning sun, soaking and shivering in the mists of evening, till men began to sicken. But not Fagan. His melodious bellow would ring triumphant along the lines each night, \"I\u0027se been wo\u0027okin\u0027 on the ra\u0027alroad,\" and cheer the drooping men, till the voices of the company wits were demanding, \"Who\u0027s dat ar white man got a ra\u0027alroad?\" And then, one day, the scouts reported that the main body of the enemy was near, that elusive body for which the regiment had been groping so long. After a little the snake broke out into a fan, and went crawling across a muddy rice-paddy toward a cane-brake. Then a flight of strangely drawling insects sang overhead, and as always, when firing is wild and high, some men in the reserve, \u0027way in the rear, lay down very suddenly. The merry bugles rattled, and the fan dissolved into a thin brown line of men who advanced swiftly to the edge of the brake, firing as they went. And then, all at once, the brake was alive with dizzily flashing steel. A little brown man rose in front of Fagan, and a flash darted straight at his head. Instinctively his muscles reacted, and he ducked backward like a boxer. So the bolo missed his head, but the sharp point, tearing downward, ripped through shirt and flesh on his breast. Fagan stared stupidly at the dripping red edges of the blue cloth till the sharp tingle of the flesh stirred him. As before, he felt a blinding impulse to strike, and whirled his heavy rifle in one hand, as a boy might a stick. He looked down at the quivering, moaning thing before him, and a mad joy of strength surged over him. A little way apart a struggling group was weaving in and out with darts of steel and quick flashes of rifles, and hoarse gruntings and cursings. He ran toward it, swinging his broken rifle round his head. \"Give \u0027em heyell, boys,\" he shouted. \"Kill the damn niggers.\" From that day he was called Wild Fagan, and Fagan the Nigger-Killer, and as the campaign progressed, his renown passed beyond his regiment. \"Heard about that wild nigger in the Fifty-fourth?\" asked the Cavalry, borrowing a pinch of Durham and a pit of paper from the Mountain Battery. \"Don\u0027t sabe fire his rifle. Just butts in and swats \u0027em with it, like he was wantin\u0027 to play gollf.\" The story grew till the Marines, returning from shore service, told the Fleet, half-seriously, of a wild regiment come straight from Africa, \"what only knew how to fight with war-clubs.\" And jacky, ever ready to believe, swore softly in admiration, and spat over the rail, and dreamed of having a little go with that regiment, some night in Nagasaki, when every one had had about seven drinks all round. Even the officers began to boast. \"Oh, you mean our man Fagan,\" the Colonel would say to guests at mess. \"Yes, he\u0027s a good man. Expensive—a rifle lasts him about a day when things are lively;—but efficient. Yes, highly efficient. The natives are beginning to dodge the regiment. Yes, I\u0027ll let you see him after dinner. Finest build of a man you ever laid eyes on. Like a cat, you know, like a cat and a grizzly rolled into one.\" And Fagan through it all was unchanged, good-natured, childlike as ever. He was even a bit ashamed of his strength. \"That little scrap down by the bridge?\" he would say to a group of admirers. \"Oh, that all wa\u0027n\u0027t nothin\u0027. That big Fillypeeno? Oh, yes, I hit him. Yes, I raickon I smashed him some,\" he would muse with his slow smile. \"I broke my gun on him. Anybody got any tobacca? I nevah can keep no tobacca.\" It was after the fighting was done and the regiment went into stations of companies in the villages that the change began to come. The men, keyed to exertion and excitement, found the idleness of barrack life first pleasant, then irksome. And they were at home in these sunny islands, far more at home than ever in the States. They read the freedom of the land in the burning sky, and the clicking palms, and the lazy air. More than anywhere else, they read it in the dark, admiring eyes of the brown, slim, soft-moving girls. The men began to be absent at check roll-call at Taps. Then all the wisdom and tact of an officer was needed. Too great easiness meant loss of control, harshness meant desertions. For a time Lieutenant Sharpe did very well. He overlooked what he could, and was unangered in his firmness when he must be firm. But nature and fixed habit overcame him, and Fagan was naturally the chief sufferer, for the officer had grown into the belief that Fagan was the probable cause of every misdemeanor in the company. So it was a reprimand, and then another sharper, and then the summary court—where the Lieutenant was prosecutor and jury and judge—sentenced Fagan to the loss of a month\u0027s pay for attempting to run the guard at some unearthly hour of the night. Within a week he repeated the offence, and Lieutenant Sharpe, with the fear of God and the Regulations in his heart, and wondrous small understanding in his head, sentenced him to a \"month and a month.\" A month of confinement will give any man much time for reflection, and the Lieutenant hoped it might prove salutary. Fagan received his sentence with ominous lack of his former protestations, and went quietly to the guard-house. But being neither an accomplished thinker nor an expert in moral theory, he did not reflect. He merely sat there and brooded. \"All I\u0027m lookin\u0027 for is jus\u0027 a fayah show,\" he told himself, over and over again. \"He use me right, an\u0027 I\u0027ll use him right. Ain\u0027t I the bes\u0027 fightin\u0027 man in the regiment, ain\u0027t the Kuhnel done said so, a whole plainty o\u0027 times? When they\u0027s fightin\u0027, I\u0027ll be there. But that little Lootenant—Lawszee, couldn\u0027 I smash him—all I want is jus\u0027 a straight deal.\" Fagan emerged at the end of his month still a child, but a sullen child now, moping over a bitter sense of injustice. \"I ain\u0027 nevah gwine to stay in theah anothah night,\" he told his friend the Sergeant. \"All I want is a fayah deal, an\u0027 I\u0027ll use ev\u0027rybody straight. But no one ain\u0027t gwine to keep me in theah again.\" The Sergeant, wise as most old soldiers, made no answer. If the Lieutenant and Wild Fagan were to fight it out, it was no affair of the Sergeant\u0027s. But Fagan, over the drinks, repeated his ultimatum to other men, who waited joyously for the clash, and were surprised and disappointed when Fagan went quietly to the guard-house once again, placed there to await the sitting of a general court martial. The quietness was only because he was learning to plan. When the silence of midnight came, he stole over to an inner window, braced a shoulder and a knee, and the rusted bars yielded noiselessly. He crept up-stairs to his squad-room and took the rifle and the belt, heavy with two hundred rounds of ammunition, from the head of his bunk, and crept as silently down. He tried to steal by the guard at the gate, but the man turned and leveled his rifle, hardly six feet away. \"Halt! Who goes theah?\" he challenged, with the mechanical lilt of the sentry. \"You min\u0027 you\u0027 business, Sam, an\u0027 I\u0027ll ten\u0027 to mine,\" Fagan growled. But the man persisted, though with a tremor in his voice. \"Yo\u0027 halt, Fagan. Ah\u0027ve got to fin\u0027—\" Fagan gripped his rifle by the muzzle, and stepped swiftly toward the leveled one. \"You git out o\u0027 heah, Sam,\" he ordered. \"Git, or I\u0027ll smash you.\" The sentry dropped his rifle. \"Ah ain\u0027 nevah troubled you all, Fagan,\" he whined. \"Ah\u0027m a frien\u0027 o\u0027 you all\u0027s. You lait me alone.\" He sank to his knees. \"You lait me alone. Don\u0027 you touch me, don\u0027 you touch—\" His voice rose to a shriek, but he was talking to empty air. Fagan had picked up the extra rifle and slipped away toward the town. \"Ah couldn\u0027 he\u0027ep it, sah. He done come up out o\u0027 the dahk, with his eyes a buhnin\u0027, an\u0027 he sa-ays, \u0027Ah\u0027ll maash you, Sam.\u0027 Ah couldn\u0027 he\u0027ep mase\u0027ef. Ah\u0027ve seen him maash these yere Fillypeenos.\" Thus the sentry to the Lieutenant next morning, with heartfelt earnestness. \"Ah wouldn\u0027 cared if he was gwine to shoot, but he comes a grinnin\u0027, an\u0027 he sa-ays, \u0027Ah\u0027ll maash you, Sam.\u0027 That\u0027s what he sa-ays, an\u0027 he\u0027d a done it,\" he explained later, to a group of sympathizing men. \"Ah don\u0027 min\u0027 gettin\u0027 shot, but Ah suah don\u0027 wantah git maashed. So Ah dropped ma rifle. Ah\u0027ve seen him maash these yere Fillypeenos. He ain\u0027 no man, he\u0027s a plumb bawn devil, tha\u0027s what he is,\" and Sam wiped the sweat drops from his throat with the back of his big, shaking hand. Then ensued many tentative pushings at the bars, to prove that no two mere men could spring them back into position, and many side-long glances at Fagan\u0027s ownerless cot and the chest which stood beside it, closed and mysterious. When the men turned in, no one objected that Sam placed a lighted candle on it. \"They don\u0027 come roun\u0027 wheah it\u0027s light,\" he explained vaguely to the room, and every one knew what \"they\" meant. Even the old Sergeant, coming through at roll-call, apparently did not see the forbidden light. And now the United States Army lapsed into a state of hysteria which often amused and puzzled those who witnessed it. It became haunted by a big black man who mashed people instead of shooting them decently. There happened to be a recrudescence of fighting, and the Army imputed it to Fagan. That stupid, brooding, grown-up child became a tactician, a strategist, a second De Wet of guerilla warfare. \"I have the honor to report,\" wrote young Shavetail to the A.G.O.—through proper channels—\"a sharp engagement wherein the enemy hindered the development of my flanking movement by—unusual brilliancy for native leaders—honor to suggest—deserter Fagan rumored to be in vicinity.\" \"Scouts report,\" wired Major Oakleaf, \"two hours\u0027 ride southeast of camp, huge negro. Request description renegade Fagan.\" \"We\u0027re out gunnin\u0027 fer that big buck nigger answers to the name of Fagan,\" remarked Mountain Battery to Cavalry, borrowing back the \"makings\" and a match to boot. \"He\u0027s seen up back here in the foot-hills last night.\" \"Wire through this mornin\u0027,\" jeered Signal Corps, overhearing, \"reportin\u0027 him up Cagayan way. An\u0027 yesterday he was down in Batangas. He sure must hike light.\" \"Well, he\u0027s a lively nigger, from all I hear,\" said Cavalry judicially. \"Some one\u0027ll likely get hurt \u0027fore they get him.\" \"He\u0027ll maybe get hurt a little bit himself, just a shade, if this old girl falls on him,\" laughed Mountain Battery, patting the nose of the vicious little gun in the packsaddle. \"Ho\u0027 still, you old mule-horse, you! Think I\u0027ll stand for you kickin\u0027 me?\" So the little armies marched and sweated, and the wires carried bulletins to every little post: \"Inform troops and natives—renegade Fagan, deserter Fifty-fourth—very big black negro, age twenty-one, large bolo scar on breast—five hundred dollars, gold, alive or dead.\" And all the while Fagan was living quietly with the girl who had been the chief cause of all his insubordination, in a little mountain village not fifty miles from the place where his ghost first rose and called for lighted candles. The reports of his evil fame brought him no joy. \"Why can\u0027t they let us alone,\" he complained to Patricia. \"I never hurt them, and if they don\u0027t trouble us we won\u0027t trouble them. Eh, Patsí?\" and he swept the slender girl up to his shoulder. \"Pooh,\" cried Patricia disdainfully, from her height. \"What do we care for them! You will kill them all, won\u0027t you?\" She pinched the great supporting arm with a sigh of satisfaction. \"Hola, there\u0027s Enrique\u0027s cock fighting with Juan\u0027s. Let\u0027s go and watch them.\" And as they walked down the narrow grassy street, the people stepped aside with cheerful smiles, for all the world like the dusty pickaninnies on the levee when one of the heaven-born passes by. For a long time Fagan and Patricia lived on in the village, till the man was becoming a myth. A dozen enterprising hunters had brought in his head, and the papers in Manila had ceased to give circumstantial accounts of his capture even when news was short. But at last an American prisoner came to the town, the only white man who saw Fagan alive after his desertion. By a strange chance he was an officer of the Fifty-fourth, and Fagan received him with sober joy. \"I\u0027se right glad to see you, Lootenant,\" he said. \"I raickoned they\u0027d bring you up heah, when I hea\u0027d you was done capchuhed. They kind brings mos\u0027 ev\u0027ything up to me, these days.\" The white man was not joyous, though undismayed. \"What are you going to do with me, now you\u0027ve got me?\" he demanded. \"Don\u0027 you worry, Lootenant,\" Fagan answered. \"I wouldn\u0027 huht you. No, sir, you nevah troubled me. You jus\u0027 set down an\u0027 have a smoke. I\u0027se a gwine to send you down, jus\u0027 as soon as I can.\" They sat and smoked in silence, the giant negro, the prisoner in his draggled uniform, the little brown guards with their naked bobs. At last Fagan said, \"I raickon we could talk bettah if these yere guards was away. You git,\" he pointed to them. \"Course you give you\u0027 wohd, Lootenant, you won\u0027t try to \u0027scape.\" The officer nodded, and fell to watching the great, quiet, unshapen black face. It roused his curiosity for a certain non-offensive air of self-reliance which he had never seen in a black face before. \"Fagan,\" he asked suddenly, \"why did you do it?\" \"Do what, Lootenant?\" \"Desert, and lead the natives against us, and all that.\" The negro clenched his great fist. \"This yere fool talk makes me plumb riled,\" he said. \"I ain\u0027 nevah fought the \u0027Mericans. I\u0027se a \u0027Merican myse\u0027f, ain\u0027t I? An\u0027 what would I want to go yampin\u0027 roun\u0027 the country for, anyway? I\u0027se got all I want right heah, chickens, an\u0027 yams, an\u0027 a good dry house, an\u0027—\" He reached out his hand and grasped Patricia\u0027s little one, and they smiled at each other. \"No, sir, I don\u0027 want no moah fightin\u0027. I\u0027se got a good home, an\u0027 I goes to sleep when I wants to, an\u0027 I gits up when I wants to, an\u0027 I has clean clo\u0027es ev\u0027y day. You tell the Kuhnel, Lootenant, you tell him Fagan nevah went to huht no \u0027Mericans, an\u0027 nevah will, less\u0027n they goes to huht me first. You believe that, don\u0027 you, Lootenant?\" And the officer gravely nodded \"Yes.\" \"Bout that desertin\u0027, now. I\u0027se thought a whole lot about that, an\u0027 I raickon I done it jus\u0027 because I had to have mo\u0027 room. I\u0027se some big, I raickon—\" he let his eyes travel slowly down his body and chuckled—\"seems like I has to have a whole plainty o\u0027 room. Seems like they wahn\u0027t room fo\u0027 me an\u0027 Lootenant Sha\u0027ap in one ahmy. No, sir. An\u0027 then, I dunno, Lootenant, maybe you nevah felt how a woman can make you \u0027shamed of youse\u0027f? This Patricia lady, maybe she don\u0027 seem like much to you, but she\u0027s a heap to me—yes, sir,—an\u0027 she kep\u0027 sayin\u0027, \u0027What for you go calabozo, Fagan? Kill the little pig of a teniente,\u0027 she says. \u0027Kill ev\u0027rybody. You\u0027se big enough.\u0027 An\u0027 then she laughs at me. \u0027Is you \u0027fraid, big man?\u0027 she says. \u0027Lend me youah revolvah, then. I\u0027se little, but I ain\u0027t afraid.\u0027 She jus\u0027 made me plumb scairt of myse\u0027f, an\u0027 we come away, \u0027cause Patsí an\u0027 me needed more room \u0027n what Lootenant Sha\u0027ap could give us. \u0027Pears like you couldn\u0027 understan\u0027 it, but that\u0027s the way it was, I raickon. I jus\u0027 had to desert or huht somebody bad.\" He stopped, and the woman began to speak to him. The white man watched her, and a great light burst upon him. She was glorious, this slim, soft brown thing with the dusky hair and the straight, slender neck, and—\"I\u0027se little, but I ain\u0027t afraid.\" Ages of civilization dropped from the man as he gazed, and with a graceless pity he compared the pale fettered women he had known with this free, wild, perfect thing whose feeling was her life. She was talking with her tongue and eyes and hands, and Fagan answered a few words and laughed, and she laughed, too, a sound as natural and sweet as the ripple of a stream, and then her great eyes lighted with earnestness as she went on. The Lieutenant felt a pang of something almost jealousy. He could never bring fire to those eyes, he was not a man to her, only a thing, not to be compared with that black giant. Fagan turned to him with an amused chuckle. \"She\u0027s full o\u0027 ginger,\" he said. \"I raickon it\u0027s lucky I was heah when you come. She\u0027s jus\u0027 been askin\u0027 when I was goin\u0027 to kill you. \u0027You must,\u0027 she says, \u0027or else he\u0027ll lead soldiers up heah.\u0027 That\u0027s all right, Lootenant,\" he said, as the officer moved uneasily. \"That\u0027s you\u0027 duty, an\u0027 it\u0027s all right, only she don\u0027 understand that. \u0027Le\u0027s kill him now,\u0027 she says. \u0027You keep a talkin\u0027 with him, an\u0027 I\u0027ll put the knife into him from behin\u0027. It won\u0027 be no trouble at all.\u0027 Lawszee,\" he chuckled admiringly, \"I raickon she\u0027d a done it, too. She\u0027s got moah ginger!\" The Lieutenant smiled with him, but he soon rose, unobtrusively, and seated himself with his back to the solid corner-post of the house. Patricia watched the manoeuvre with unfathomable eyes, and the men burst into laughter; then she hung her head like a child caught in some mischief. The gesture was adorable, and suddenly sadness stifled the white man\u0027s laughter. \"I\u0027m sorry about reporting your presence here,\" he said. \"I understand, I think, and I believe you don\u0027t want to make trouble, but—\" \"Don\u0027 you worry about that,\" Fagan broke in. \"I\u0027se a gwine to send you down to the ra\u0027alroad this afternoon. An\u0027 now Patsí\u0027s goin\u0027 to get you some dinner.\" \"Fagan,\" said the Lieutenant, yet more earnestly, while his guard waited for him to mount, \"I\u0027m right sorry about this. But—why don\u0027t you come down with me now and surrender?\" he asked impulsively. \"That will help, and I can explain some things to the court, and you\u0027ll only get six months or so, for desertion. Only six months, and then—you can come back to Patricia,\" he ended almost enviously. The negro seemed to swell before the white man\u0027s astonished eyes. \"I\u0027se sorry, too. It\u0027s been mighty pleasant, livin\u0027 heah,\" he said simply. \"An\u0027 thank you fer askin\u0027 me to come down. I know you means it straight. But you can\u0027t see it like I do. Down theah I\u0027se a niggah soldier. Up heah I\u0027se— Nobody ain\u0027t got any right to try me,\" he burst out. \"I nevah troubled them. You tell the Kuhnel that, I want he should understan\u0027. I don\u0027 want to huht no one, but I\u0027se nevah gwine into no gahd-house again. Good-by, Lootenant, an\u0027 luck. I don\u0027 raickon we all\u0027ll evah meet up again.\" Fagan and Patricia. Fagan and Patricia. So Fagan and Patricia must needs leave the snug little house at the end of the sleepy, grass-grown street, and go out on the High Trail, the unknown of the people of the plains, a broad highway to things with hoofs and claws and wings, and to men little less wild than they, the men of the hills. At times the brown thread of the Trail was twined amid the giant roots of trees, and they wandered in a cool twilight, alone with the long creepers and the ferns and the bright birds which played about some opening in the matted roof, far above their heads, where the sun dropped through for a brief hour. Sometimes it clung to the massive walls of a ca?on, where a river boiled so far below that the sound of its torment came to their ears like the babble of a brook. Sometimes it shot upward to the realm of the clouds, and from the bare, grassy heights they peered out through shifting mist wreaths over all the cities and fields of the plains to the blue hint of the distant sea. Fagan and Patricia followed the Trail steadily but leisurely, day after day. There was no call for haste, no white pursuer knew that road. So they laughed and played, and lay for hours beside some cool spring, basking in the warm sunshine and the thin, sharp air, and camped at night in little valleys under a pall of cloud. Once Fagan shot a deer, and they delayed for days, drying the meat over pungent wood-smoke. But as their muscles hardened to the Trail, they insensibly made greater progress, in spite of their dallying. Two weeks brought them to the land of the Unknown, had they but known it. The mountains were higher and wilder, the cloud-caps more frequent. Often the forest on some huge hill, towering black above the Trail, was thin and pointed at the top, as if it had been torn, and there, unseen of them, was a village perched high on the trunks of trees, whence keen-eyed men watched their progress. But they were children of the plains and could not know, so they walked undismayed. And the keen-eyed men walked with them, unseen, frisking along above them over ground where others would have crept—short, huge-limbed men, whose stiff black hair flowed over their shoulders, and was tied out of their eyes with fillets, men who squatted naked in the mists of evening and did not shiver, men who brought their sweethearts hideous dowries of human heads. They hung about the Trail, watching these strange creatures who walked openly and undismayed in the land of Fear. Often, when the camp-fire was lighted, they stole up with their muscles twitching like a cat\u0027s before she springs, and then halted as a great voice rang over the forest—\"I\u0027se been wo\u0027okin\u0027 on the ra\u0027alroad\"—and they clawed their way up the slopes to the long-legged villages, and took counsel together in the queer fire-shadows. One evening as they camped, Patricia missed a little bundle of venison and strolled back along the Trail to look for it. Fagan kindled the fire and then strolled back, too. \"Hoy, Patsí,\" he called. The forest was silent. He turned a bend in the Trail, and there—Fagan gazed at it stupidly. Then the blind impulse of wrath swept over him again. But there was naught to strike. The long shadows of the trees lay across the Trail, the creepers swayed lazily in the evening breeze; far up, a crow called petulantly to her belated mate. Fagan swung his arm helplessly at the forest. \"Come out,\" he moaned, \"come out wheah I can see you. Come out, you cowards, you sneakin\u0027 dogs that kills women from behind. I\u0027se not afraid of you. Oh, I\u0027ll mash you! Come!\" With a soft chug, a lance stuck quivering in the tree beside him. Otherwise all was silent; even the crow had ceased to scold. He looked down. A darker shadow was stealing among the lengthening ones on the Trail. The spirit of the forest gripped Fagan with an icy hand, the spirit of Dread. He ran blindly to the fire, seized his rifle, and took up the Trail alone. For three days and nights he hurried on. The empty pain of his stomach, the dizzying, numbing lack of sleep, could not hold him against the dread of his unseen escort. It gave little sign, simply the rustling of a fern now and then, the swaying of one creeper when others were still, but he felt its presence and staggered on. On the evening of the third day, he stepped suddenly from the forest into a little theatre among the hills. A clear brook bubbled over golden gravel; the turf beneath a great solitary tree was thick and soft. Wild cocks in the wood were crowing their families to roost. Everything was quiet and peaceful, and Fagan, as he gazed, became peaceful and quiet, too. He flung himself on the soft turf, and drank his fill from the little brook. As always, when he sought to rest, the forest became vague with life. A covey of jungle-fowl, flushed by a sudden fright, whirred across the opening. A stone rolled somewhere close at hand, dislodged by a purposely careless foot. But this time Fagan merely grinned, and shook off his clinging cartridge-belt. \"You can\u0027 bluff me no moah,\" he said to the forest, a trick he had learned of late. A fern swayed not a dozen yards away, and he clicked a cartridge into his Krag and fired. \"You git out,\" he chuckled. \"I\u0027se a gittin\u0027 tired of you\u0027 company.\" When he was rested a little, he kindled a fire and toasted a bit of venison. Then he lay back lazily and twisted his last bit of tobacco into a cigarette. Between puffs he bellowed his evening song, and the rude melody took on the sweetness of a ballad. \"Don\u0027 you heah the bugle callin\u0027?\" Fagan sang, and tossed the butt of the cigarette into the fire. It was quite dark now in the hollow, and he sat in a little circle of dancing light. He looked at the wall of blackness with quiet, unfrightened eyes that presently began to close with the pressure of a mighty drowsiness. \"I\u0027se po\u0027owful sleepy now,\" he announced at length, \"an\u0027 I\u0027se a gwine to bed. I was hopin\u0027 to set up an\u0027 meet some of you all, but I can\u0027t do it. When you all wants me, you all can wake me up.\" The fire flickered, and he pillowed his head on his arm, and watched the dance of the shadows grow shorter. \"Lawszee,\" he murmured, drowsily, as the great numbness of sleep overcame him, \"I raickon Patricia\u0027d think I was scairt again. She\u0027d a sat up an\u0027 waited foh them, but I can\u0027t. That little girl did have the po\u0027owf\u0027les\u0027 lot o\u0027 ginger in her.\" He threw his great arm protectingly over the empty ground beside him. \"Good night, Patsí,\" he murmured. In that well-remembered town among the paddies, a squat and naked man, huge-muscled, came out of the door of the quarters. In his hand he carried a broad-bladed spear. A head-axe, bright as only speckless steel can be in sunlight, flashed in his girdle. And at his back a bag, plumply round, bobbed heavily, and as it bobbed it gave out a dull jingle, as of coined metal. \"Got his money, all right,\" said one of the group that watched him. The savage halted, and grinned widely at each in turn. \"Me got,\" he announced proudly. \"Mucho dinero. Mucho mucho dinero. Me got.\" He could scarcely contain his joy. One of the watchers growled. \"I\u0027m not in favior,\" said he, \"of payin\u0027 gu-gus for killin\u0027 white men, no matter whether they\u0027re white or black. It\u0027s a catchin\u0027 habit.\" It was the judicial soldier. He swung his lean bulk toward the grinning little man. \"Now you\u0027ve got it,\" he commanded, \"git!\" The savage, half-comprehending, turned and passed down the path they opened for him, and down the sun-beaten, dusty street, where the silent people fell away before him as if he carried pestilence. And so they saw the last of him, making for those distant, cloud-hung hills of his, moving clumsily but swiftly across the paddies at his shuffling trot, while the price of a man\u0027s rebellion bobbed, and jingled dully at his back.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297/90181.html","bookId":454,"book":{"id":454,"title":"The Little Gods","description":"简介： For the life of me, as I was sitting here this sunny, late-October morning, I could not write, a distressing condition, truly, for one who lives by writing....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3297","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
