{"id":2639,"title":"Skipping Christmas","description":"Storyline: \n Imagine a year without Christmas. No crowded shops, no corny office parties, no fruitcakes, no unwanted presents. That\u0027s just what Luther and Nora Krank have in mind when they decide that, just this once, they\u0027ll skip the holiday altogether. Theirs will be the only house on the street without a rooftop Frosty the snowman; they won\u0027t be hosting their annual Christmas Eve bash; they aren\u0027t even going to have a tree. They won\u0027t need one, because come December 25 they\u0027re setting sail on a Caribbean cruise. But, as this weary couple is about to discover, skipping Christmas brings enormous consequences - and isn\u0027t half as easy as they\u0027d imagined. \n A classic tale for modern times, Skipping Christmas offers a hilarious look at the chaos and frenzy that has become part of our holiday tradition.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/skipping-christmas.jpg","author":"John Grisham","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":20,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
