{"id":36021,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30 Consequences","content":"Mrs. Chester\u0027s fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the matter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily. The \u0027haughty, uninteresting creature\u0027 was let severely alone, but Amy\u0027s talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it. Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young, with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together. May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy\u0027s dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May\u0027s painted vases--that was one thorn. Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at a late party and only once with May--that was thorn number two. But the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs\u0027. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had reached the culprits, however, and Amy\u0027s dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look . . . \"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls. As this is the most prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take this place. I\u0027m sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have another table if you like.\" Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy\u0027s unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble. Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did, \"Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?\" \"Now, my dear, don\u0027t have any ill feeling, I beg. It\u0027s merely a matter of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this table is considered their proper place. I think it very appropriate to you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty, but we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn\u0027t you like the flower table? The little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. You could make a charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you know.\" \"Especially to gentlemen,\" added May, with a look which enlightened Amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. She colored angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with unexpected amiability . . . \"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I\u0027ll give up my place here at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.\" \"You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,\" began May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged. She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly . . . \"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way,\" and sweeping her contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness. \"Now she\u0027s mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn\u0027t asked you to speak, Mama,\" said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table. \"Girls\u0027 quarrels are soon over,\" returned her mother, feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might. The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. But everything seemed against her. It was late, and she was tired. Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch wouldn\u0027t stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled. Her best tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid\u0027s cheek. She bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task. There was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening. Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done right. Beth declared she wouldn\u0027t go to the fair at all, and Jo demanded why she didn\u0027t take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her. \"Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such things, and though I think I\u0027ve a right to be hurt, I don\u0027t intend to show it. They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions, won\u0027t they, Marmee?\" \"That\u0027s the right spirit, my dear. A kiss for a blow is always best, though it\u0027s not very easy to give it sometimes,\" said her mother, with the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and practicing. In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate, Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her enemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers, were the words, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" \"I ought, but I don\u0027t,\" thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright page to May\u0027s discontented face behind the big vases, that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. Amy stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street, school, office, or home. Even a fair table may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season. Amy\u0027s conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do, took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice. A group of girls were standing about May\u0027s table, admiring the pretty things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. She heard May say sorrowfully . . . \"It\u0027s too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don\u0027t want to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just complete then. Now it\u0027s spoiled.\" \"I dare say she\u0027d put them back if you asked her,\" suggested someone. \"How could I after all the fuss?\" began May, but she did not finish, for Amy\u0027s voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly . . . \"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I was just thinking I\u0027d offer to put them back, for they belong to your table rather than mine. Here they are, please take them, and forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.\" As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it. \"Now, I call that lovely of her, don\u0027t you?\" cried one girl. May\u0027s answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable laugh, \"Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn\u0027t sell them at her own table.\" Now, that was hard. When we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is, as she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, and her table to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly. It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind her table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon. Few cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long before night. The art table was the most attractive in the room. There was a crowd about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. Amy often looked wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom. She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea. Beth helped her dress, and made a charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned. \"Don\u0027t do anything rude, pray Jo; I won\u0027t have any fuss made, so let it all pass and behave yourself,\" begged Amy, as she departed early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table. \"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and his boys will lend a hand, and we\u0027ll have a good time yet.\" returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie. Presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him. \"Is that my boy?\" \"As sure as this is my girl!\" and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified. \"Oh, Teddy, such doings!\" and Jo told Amy\u0027s wrongs with sisterly zeal. \"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I\u0027ll be hanged if I don\u0027t make them buy every flower she\u0027s got, and camp down before her table afterward,\" said Laurie, espousing her cause with warmth. \"The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not arrive in time. I don\u0027t wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I shouldn\u0027t wonder if they never came at all. When people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another,\" observed Jo in a disgusted tone. \"Didn\u0027t Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to.\" \"I didn\u0027t know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was poorly, I didn\u0027t like to worry him by asking, though I did want some.\" \"Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They are just as much yours as mine. Don\u0027t we always go halves in everything?\" began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny. \"Gracious, I hope not! Half of some of your things wouldn\u0027t suit me at all. But we mustn\u0027t stand philandering here. I\u0027ve got to help Amy, so you go and make yourself splendid, and if you\u0027ll be so very kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I\u0027ll bless you forever.\" \"Couldn\u0027t you do it now?\" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the bars, \"Go away, Teddy, I\u0027m busy.\" Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece. Then the March family turned out en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy\u0027s taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets, encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room. Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the conclusion, about that time, that virtue was it\u0027s own reward, after all. Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the Hall, picking up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of the Chester change of base. She reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible. She also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and considered her a model of magnanimity. As she passed the art table, she glanced over it for her sister\u0027s things, but saw no sign of them. \"Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,\" thought Jo, who could forgive her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her family. \"Good evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on?\" asked May with a conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be generous. \"She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is enjoying herself. The flower table is always attractive, you know, \u0027especially to gentlemen\u0027.\" Jo couldn\u0027t resist giving that little slap, but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to praising the great vases, which still remained unsold. \"Is Amy\u0027s illumination anywhere about? I took a fancy to buy that for Father,\" said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister\u0027s work. \"Everything of Amy\u0027s sold long ago. I took care that the right people saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,\" returned May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy had, that day. Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of May\u0027s word and manner. \"Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,\" she said, ordering out \u0027Teddy\u0027s own\u0027, as the girls called the college friends. \"\u0027Charge, Chester, charge!\u0027 is the motto for that table, but do your duty like men, and you\u0027ll get your money\u0027s worth of art in every sense of the word,\" said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field. \"To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,\" said little Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said . . . \"Very well, my son, for a small boy!\" and walked him off, with a paternal pat on the head. \"Buy the vases,\" whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals of fire on her enemy\u0027s head. To May\u0027s great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but pervaded the hall with one under each arm. The other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases. Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later. The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnight, she did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look which said \u0027forgive and forget\u0027. That satisfied Amy, and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each. \"The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,\" as Laurie announced with a flourish. \"You\u0027ve a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You\u0027ve behaved sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart,\" said Jo warmly, as they brushed their hair together late that night. \"Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. It must have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things. I don\u0027t believe I could have done it as kindly as you did,\" added Beth from her pillow. \"Why, girls, you needn\u0027t praise me so. I only did as I\u0027d be done by. You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know how. I can\u0027t explain exactly, but I want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women. I\u0027m far from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mother is.\" Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, \"I understand now what you mean, and I\u0027ll never laugh at you again. You are getting on faster than you think, and I\u0027ll take lessons of you in true politeness, for you\u0027ve learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you\u0027ll get your reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall.\" A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be delighted. A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March\u0027s face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and Beth, who were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were. \"Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants . . .\" \"Me to go with her!\" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture. \"No, dear, not you. It\u0027s Amy.\" \"Oh, Mother! She\u0027s too young, it\u0027s my turn first. I\u0027ve wanted it so long. It would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid. I must go!\" \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor.\" \"It\u0027s always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn\u0027t fair, oh, it isn\u0027t fair!\" cried Jo passionately. \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to me the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said--\u0027I planned at first to ask Jo, but as \u0027favors burden her\u0027, and she \u0027hates French\u0027, I think I won\u0027t venture to invite her. Amy is more docile, will make a good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her.\" \"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! Why can\u0027t I learn to keep it quiet?\" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing. When she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said sorrowfully . . . \"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time, so try to bear it cheerfully, and don\u0027t sadden Amy\u0027s pleasure by reproaches or regrets.\" \"I\u0027ll try,\" said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset. \"I\u0027ll take a leaf out of her book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute of happiness. But it won\u0027t be easy, for it is a dreadful disappointment,\" and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears. \"Jo, dear, I\u0027m very selfish, but I couldn\u0027t spare you, and I\u0027m glad you are not going quite yet,\" whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears, and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it. By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without repinings at Amy\u0027s good fortune. The young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture, and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself. \"It isn\u0027t a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,\" she said impressively, as she scraped her best palette. \"It will decide my career, for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove it.\" \"Suppose you haven\u0027t?\" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy. \"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,\" replied the aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she made a wry face at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes. \"No, you won\u0027t. You hate hard work, and you\u0027ll marry some rich man, and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,\" said Jo. \"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don\u0027t believe that one will. I\u0027m sure I wish it would, for if I can\u0027t be an artist myself, I should like to be able to help those who are,\" said Amy, smiling, as if the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor drawing teacher. \"Hum!\" said Jo, with a sigh. \"If you wish it you\u0027ll have it, for your wishes are always granted--mine never.\" \"Would you like to go?\" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife. \"Rather!\" \"Well, in a year or two I\u0027ll send for you, and we\u0027ll dig in the Forum for relics, and carry out all the plans we\u0027ve made so many times.\" \"Thank you. I\u0027ll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes, if it ever does,\" returned Jo, accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could. There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment till Amy was off. Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried till she couldn\u0027t cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed. Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last lingerer, saying with a sob . . . \"Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen . . .\" \"I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I\u0027ll come and comfort you,\" whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word. So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea. 切斯特夫人的交易会非常优雅，用人非常挑剔，邻里的年轻女士们都把能被请去占一张桌子当作荣耀。每个人都对这件事产生了极大的兴趣。艾美被请了去，乔却没有。这对所有参加者来说是个幸事，因为，她此时正当胳膊叉腰自命不凡的年龄，要吃不少苦头才能学会如何和人融洽相处。于是这位\"高傲又令人乏味的家伙\"被冷冷撇在一边，而艾美则凭一张艺术桌子把她的天赋与情趣充分展示出来。艾美尽最大努力张罗着适宜的、有价值的东西装备那张桌子。 一切都进行得顺利，可是，交易会开幕的前一天发生了一件小冲突。当二十五六个老少妇人在一起做事时，每个人都有自己的愠怒与偏见，这种冲突便是不可避免的。 梅·切斯特相当妒忌艾美，因为艾美比她更招人喜爱。就在那时，发生了一些琐碎小事增加了她的妒忌感。艾美那雅致的钢笔画作品使梅的着色花瓶黯然失色 -这是第一个苦恼；最近一次舞会上，迷倒所有姑娘的图德和艾美跳了四次舞，只和梅跳了一次--这是第二个苦恼；压在她心头最大的不是传到她耳中的闲言碎语，说马奇家的女孩们在兰姆家笑话了她，这给了她采取不友好行动的藉口。本来这一切该怪罪乔的，是她活灵活现地模仿梅，谁都能看出来，而那爱闹的兰姆们又让笑话传了出来。两个罪犯对后来的事一无所知，所以可以想象出艾美听了切斯特夫人一番话的沮丧。切斯特夫人听说女儿被人笑话，当然恼火。交易会的前一天晚上，艾美正在为她漂亮的桌子做最后的装饰，切斯特夫人不动声色、冷冷地对她说道- “亲爱的，我把这张桌子给了别人而没给我女儿们，我发现年轻女士们有些看法。这张桌子最显眼，有人说所有桌子中这一张最吸引人。我女儿们是这个会的主要筹备人，所以最好让她们占这张桌子。很抱歉，可是我知道你真心实意热衷这个会，你不会介意个人的失望。你要是愿意可以占另外一个桌子。“切斯特夫人事先想象这一番话容易说出口，可是，真到要说的时候，却发现很难自自然然地说出来。艾美不加怀疑地直盯着她，一脸惊奇与困惑。 艾美觉得这件事背后有些蹊跷，可是猜不出原因。她感到受到了伤害，也表示出这一点。她轻轻地说： “也许你一张桌子也不想给我？”“不，亲爱的，请你不要生气。你要知道，这只不过是个权宜之计。我女儿们要领个头。这张桌子自然是她们恰当的位置。我是觉得它对你非常适合，很感激你费了劲把它装饰得这么漂亮，可是，我们还是得放弃自己的愿望。我负责让你在别的地方占一个好位置。你可喜欢花卉桌？小姑娘们在管着，可是她们弄不好，在那儿灰心丧气呢。你能把它变得迷人。要知道，花卉桌总是很吸引人的。”“对先生们尤其是这样，“梅补充道。她的神情使艾美明白了使她突然失宠的原因。她脸红了，但是她没去理睬那女孩气的嘲讽，却温和得出人意料地答道- “切斯特夫人，依你的意思做吧。你要是乐意，我马上放弃这个地方，去照管花卉。”“你愿意的话，可以把你的东西放到你自己的桌上去，”梅开了口。她看着艾美如此精心制作、又雅致地摆设着的东西 -漂亮的笔架，鲜艳的贝壳，奇妙的灯饰--有点感到良心不安了。她是出于善意的，可是艾美误解了她的意思，迅即说道— “噢，当然，如果它们碍事的话。”她匆促地将她的东西扫进围裙，走开了。她觉得她自己连同她的艺术品都受到了不可原谅的羞辱。 “嗳呀，她生气了。哦，天哪！要是我没求你说就好了，妈妈，”梅说。她愁闷地看着她桌子上空出来的地方。 “女孩子吵嘴不长久，”她妈妈答言，她倒为自己掺和进去有点不好意思了。 小姑娘们高兴地为艾美和她的宝贝东西欢呼起来。这种热情的接待稍稍抚平了她不安的情绪，她立即着手工作，打定主意，即使不能施展艺术抱负，也一定要在花卉方面做出成就。可是，似乎一切都和她对着干：开始得太晚了，她也累了，大家都忙着自己的事无法帮她，而小姑娘们碍手碍脚只能帮倒忙。这些可爱的小东西们，像一群麻雀。叽叽喳喳，忙忙碌碌，毫无技巧地努力想维持桌子最完美的状态，结果造成一片混乱。艾美竖平常春藤拱架，可是拱架立不稳，当上面的吊篮装进东西时，架子摇摇摆摆，像是要倒下来砸在她头上；她最好的瓷砖画给溅上了水，结果丘比特的脸上留下了一滴黑色泪珠；她用锤子干活却伤了手；在穿堂风中做事感了冒，这使她为次日忧心忡忡。任何一个有过同样痛苦的女读者都会同情可怜的艾美，祝愿她圆满顺利地完成工作。 那天晚上回到家，她把事情说了出来，大家都很气愤。妈妈说那是个耻辱，夸艾美做得对。贝思宣布她坚决不去交易会了。乔质问艾美为什么不拿走她所有的漂亮东西，离开那帮卑鄙小人，让她们自己去开交易会。 “没有理由因为她们是小人我也当小人，我讨厌这么做。 虽然我受到了伤害，有权作出反应，可我不想表示出来。她们会觉得这比怒气冲冲的言语和行为更厉害。是不是这样，妈咪？”“这种精神对，亲爱的。用吻回报殴打总是上策，虽然有时不容易做到，”妈妈说。她知道说与做的不同。 尽管有各种自然的诱惑去反抗、报复，艾美第二天整整一天都坚持了自己的决定，一心想用好心征服她的敌人。她的开端良好，这得归功于一个无声之物的提示，这个东西来得出人意料，但是非常及时。那天早晨，她在布置桌子，小姑娘们在休息室装花篮，她拿起她心爱的摆设品 -一本小书。书的封面古色古香，爸爸把它当作宝贝。上等纸的书页里的文章还绘有美丽的彩饰图案，每一页都有。艾美带着可以原谅的骄傲神情翻着书面。她目光落在一行诗上，这使她不得不停下来思索。那一行字用鲜艳的红、蓝、黄三色云状花纹勾了边，表达了世人应在荆棘与玫瑰花丛中互相帮助的良好愿望：“汝爱邻人，应如爱己。”“我应该这样做，可是我没做到，”艾美想。她的目光从鲜艳的书页转向大花瓶后面梅不满意的脸上，那些大花瓶填不了她的那些漂亮作品曾经占据的空间。艾美站了一会儿，翻着手中的书页，每一页都读到一些对记仇、妒忌之心的轻柔指责。每天，我们从街道、学校、办公室以及家庭听到许多明智的、真正的布道，只是没有在意。假如这张交易会桌子能提出富有教益、决不过时的人生哲理，它也能成为布道讲坛。此时此地，艾美的良知向她宣讲了小书上的道理。她做了我们许多人不大做得到的事- 从善如流，并立即付诸实施。 一群女孩子围站在梅的桌旁，欣赏着漂亮的物品，议论着女售货员的变换。她们压低了声音，可是艾美知道她们在谈论她，她们听了一面之辞并且据之作出判断。这不太令人愉快，但是她的态度已经有了很大的转变。不一会儿，就来了个机会让她证明这一点。她听到梅难过地说 “太糟了，没有时间做别的东西了。我不想用乱七八糟的东西填补空缺。刚才这张桌子已布置好了，现在给毁了。”“我敢说，要是你求她，她会把东西放回来的，”有人提议。 “这一番过后，我怎么能做到呢？”梅说。然而，她话音未落，艾美动人的声音便从大厅那边传了过来 “你不用求，需要的话，尽管用好啦。我正想着提议把它们放回去呢。因为，它们属于你那张桌子，而不是这张桌子，给你吧，请收下吧。原谅我昨晚性急地把它们拿走了。”她一边说着，一边点头笑着将她的东西放了回去。然后她又匆忙走开了，她觉得做一件友好的事要比做完后留下来让人感谢容易些。 “哎呀，她这么做太可爱了，是不是？”一个女孩叫道。 梅的答语没人听见。然而，另一个显然被制作柠檬汽车弄得有点发躁的年轻女士令人不愉快地笑了笑，补充道：“非常可爱。因为她知道这些东西在她自己的桌上卖不出去。”嗳哟，这太过分了。当我们做出些不大的牺牲时，至少希望别人能欣赏。有一会儿，艾美后悔那样做了，她感到美德并不总是有回报的。但还是有的-- 正像她很快发觉的--因为，她的情绪开始高涨，她的桌子在她灵巧的双手下开花了，姑娘们非常友好。那个小小的举动似乎令人惊讶地消除了误会。 对艾美来说，那一天很长，也很难熬。她坐在桌子后面，经常是独自一人。因为小姑娘们不久都跑开了，极少有人愿意在夏天买花。还没到夜间，她的花束已开始枯萎了。 屋子里，艺术桌是最吸引人的，那儿整天围着一群人，看管人脸上带着自得的表情，手里捧着咔哒着响的钱箱，不断地跑来跑去。艾美常常渴望地看着那边，极想在那边干，在那边她感到自如、满足。可是她却身处这个角落无事可做。对我们一些人来说，这似乎不是什么难事。但是，对这样一个漂亮、活泼的年轻女孩来说，却不仅乏味，而且非常难以忍受。一想到她的家人、劳里以及劳里的朋友们晚上会在那里看到她，实在让她感到痛苦。 她到夜里才回家。虽然她没有抱怨，甚至没告诉家人她做了些什么，可是家人从她苍白的脸色、安静的态度看出这一天日子过得很艰难。妈妈亲切地多给了她一杯茶。贝思帮着她穿衣，还做了个迷人的花环让她戴在头上。而乔非同寻常地仔细梳妆打扮，隐隐约约地暗示要去掀翻那些桌子，使家人吃了一惊。 “别去做无礼的事，乔，求你了。我不想把事情搞糟，就让它过去吧，你安分点吧，”艾美央求着。她走得早，希望能再搞到一些鲜花使她那可怜的小桌子焕然一新。 “我只想尽量迎合我所认识的每一个人，让他们在你那一角尽可能多待些时间。特迪和他那帮小伙子会帮忙的，我们还是会过得愉快的，”乔回答。她靠在门边守候着劳里。不一会儿，暮色里传来了熟悉的脚步声，她跑出去迎接他。 “那是我的男孩吗？” “的确是的，就像这是我的女孩！”劳里带着志满意得的男子度让她挽起了他的胳膊。 “哦，特迪，竟有这种事！”乔怀着姐姐的不平之情告诉他艾美受到的委屈。 “不一会儿，我那一帮朋友就要坐车过来。我一定要他们买走艾美所有的花，然后就待在她的桌前。”劳里热情地支持她的事业。 “艾美说，花一点儿也不艳了，新鲜的也许又不能及时送到。我不想让人感到不公平，让人猜疑。可要是鲜花根本送不来的话，我也不会惊奇的。人们做了一件卑鄙的事，就很可能做第二件，”乔恨恨地说。 “难道海斯没把我们花园里最好的花给你？我叫他送的。”“我不知道，我估摸他忘了。你爷爷不舒服，我不想去向他要花来烦他，虽然我确实想要些。”“哎呀，乔，你怎么能想到该去要！那些花是我的也是你的。我们不是什么东西都一分为二的吧？”劳里开口说，他那种语调总是让乔变得刺人。 “天哟，希望不至如此！你一半的东西一点儿也不合我的意。只是我们不能站在这里调笑。我得去帮帮艾美，你去出你的风头吧，要是你能仁慈地让海斯送一些漂亮鲜花到交易会大厅，我会永远为你祈福的。”“你难道不能现在就为我祈福吗？”劳里挑逗地问道，吓得乔很不友好地匆匆关上门，隔着栅栏叫道：“走开，特迪，我忙着呢！”多亏了这两个共谋者，那天晚上桌子真的翻过来了。因为海斯送过去许多鲜花，花以最佳的方式装饰在一只可爱的篮子里，作为摆在桌子中央的饰品。马奇一家全体出动。乔相当成功地尽了力。人们不仅过来了，而且停留了下来，笑着听她的废话，赞赏艾美的情趣。他们显然非常开心。劳里和他的朋友们全都仗义地挺身担当重任。他们买完了花束，逗留在桌前，把那个角落变成了屋子里最热闹的地方。现在艾美如鱼得水，不为别的，只出于感激。她尽可能地做到行动活泼、举止优雅，大概在那个时刻，她得出结论：美德毕竟还是有回报的。 乔的举止得体，堪为楷模。当艾美幸福地被她的仪仗队包围着的时候，乔在大厅绕着圈听着各种闲话，这些闲话使她明白了切斯特夫人为什么作那样的变化，她为她引起的那一份敌意自责，决心尽快为艾美开释。她还了解到艾美早上是怎样处理事情的，认为艾美是宽宏大量的典范。她经过艺术桌时，扫了一眼，想找到她妹妹的东西，但是东西没有踪影。”收起来了不让人看见，我敢说，”乔想。她自己受了委屈可以原谅他人，不去计较，然而对她家人受到的侮辱，她却强烈地感到愤愤不平。 “晚上好，乔。艾美情况怎么样？”梅带着和解的口气问。 她想表明她也能做到大度的。 “她已经卖完了她所有值得卖的东西，现在她在玩呢。花卉桌总是吸引人的，你知道，\u0027对先生们尤其是这样\u0027。”乔忍不住那样轻轻地攻击了一下梅，但是梅温顺地接受了。这让她很快便后悔了，开始夸赞起那些大花瓶来，花瓶还没卖掉。 “艾美的灯饰放在哪里？我想为爸爸买，”乔说。她很想知道她妹妹作品的命运。 “艾美的所有东西早就卖完了。我设法让想买的人看见它们。那些东西为我们挣来一笔数目不小的钱，”梅回答。和艾美一样，她那天也击退了各种小诱惑。 心满意足的乔冲回去报告这个好消息。听说了梅的话语和态度，艾美又是感动，又是惊奇。 “现在，先生们，我要你们到别的桌子前尽义务，就像你们对我的桌子那样慷慨大方特别是艺术桌，”她吩咐着\"特迪的自己人\"，女孩子们对大学朋友都这么称呼。 “\u0027收钱，切斯特，收钱！\u0027这是那张桌子的口号，但是你们要像男子汉那样尽义务。你们花钱买的艺术品会完全划得来，”当这队人马准备占领阵地时，乔忍不住说。 “听令就是服从。但马奇比梅可要漂亮得多，”小帕克说道，他尽最大努力想说点既俏皮又温柔的话，但是立即被劳里制止了。 劳里说：“很好，小家伙，一个小男孩应该这样！”然后父亲似地拍了一下他的头，让他走开了。 “买那些花瓶，”艾美对劳里耳语道。她想最后一次使她的敌人惭愧难当。 使梅大为高兴的是，劳里不仅买了花瓶，而且一边夹一个，在大厅里招摇过市。其他先生同样出手大方，买起了各种各样易损的琐碎物品，然后，提溜着沉沉的蜡花、画扇、金银细丝绣饰的公文包以及其他玲珑又实用的玩意儿，在大厅时无助地闲逛。 卡罗尔婶婶也在那里，听说了这件事，很高兴，在一旁对马奇太太说着些什么。马奇太太满意地微笑着，凝望着艾美，脸上的表情混杂着自豪与焦虑。即便如此，几天以后她才说出她高兴的原因。 大家公认交易会是成功的。当梅向艾美道晚安时，她没有像往常那样过分表露感情，而是亲切地吻了她一下，脸上表情似乎在说：“原谅我，忘了它。”这使艾美感到很受用。她回到家，发现那两只花瓶各插着一大束花被陈列在客厅的壁炉架上。”奖给懿行美德的马奇，”劳里手舞足蹈地宣布。 “艾美，你的优点比我知道的更为突出。你讲道义，慷慨大方，气质高尚。你表现得很不错。我真心实意地钦佩你，”那天晚上，她们一起梳着头，乔这样热情地说。 “是的，我们都尊重你，你那样乐意宽恕别人。忙了那么长时间，一心想卖掉自己的漂亮东西，却差点白费劲，肯定非常难做。我想我做不到像你那样友好地原谅别人，”贝思从枕头上抬起头来补充道。 “哎呀，姑娘们，你们不要这样表扬我。我只是愿意别人怎样待我，我就怎么待人。我说想当个女士，你们笑话我，可我的意思是做一个思想和风度上真正的女士。我以我所知道的方式试着去做。我做不了确切的解释。我是想避开那些毁了许多妇女的小毛病，如小气、愚笨、挑剔。我做得远远不够。但是我尽力而为，希望有一天能成为妈妈那样的人。”艾美说得热切认真。乔亲切地拥抱了她一下，说：“现在我懂得你的意思了。我再也不笑话你了。你的进步比你想象的快。我会真心老老实实地向你学习，我相信，你已经入道了。亲爱的，接着试吧。总有一天你会得到回报的。到那时没有人会比我更高兴。”一个星期后，艾美真的得到了回报。乔却感到很难高兴起来。她们收到了一封卡罗尔婶婶的信。马奇太太读着信，脸上大放光彩，弄得和她在一起的乔和贝思忙问是什么喜讯。 “下个月卡罗尔婶婶要出国，她想要 ” “我和她一起去！”乔突然插嘴。她狂喜得控制不住，从椅子里蹦起来。 “不，亲爱的，不是你，是艾美。” “哦，妈妈！她太年轻了。先轮到我。我已经想了那么长时间--那样对我太有好处了，太妙了--我非要去。”“恐怕不可能，乔。婶婶决定的是艾美。她给我们这样一个恩惠，我们不好提要求的。”“总是这样。乐趣都是艾美的，活儿都是我来干。这不公平。哦，这不公平！”乔情绪激动地哭了。 “我恐怕这件事有一半是你自己的错，亲爱的，前些日子婶婶和我谈话时说到，她为你直率的态度、独立的个性感到遗憾。信上她这么写着，好像是引用了你的话 开始我打算请乔，可是，由于\u0027恩惠给她负担\u0027，她\u0027讨厌法语\u0027，我想，我不会冒昧地邀请她。艾美要温顺些，她会成为弗洛的好旅伴，她有一颗慧心领受旅行带给她的每一点馈赠。”“哦！我的舌头，我那可恶的舌头！我怎么不能学着保持沉默呢？”乔痛苦地抱怨道。她记起了让她倒霉的那些话。马奇太太听了她对信中引用的话的解释，难过地说 “我真希望你能去，可是这次没有指望了。还是安然接受现实吧，别让责备、后悔扫了艾美的兴。”“我试着做吧，”乔说。她使劲眨着眼，俯身捡起刚才兴奋时打翻的篮子。”我要模仿她，不仅看上去高兴，而且真的高兴。一分钟也不忌妒她的幸福。但是这不大容易做。我的失望太大了。“可怜的乔伤心地哭了，眼泪打湿了手中插满针的小针插。 “乔，亲爱的。我很自私。可是我不能放开你。我很高兴你暂时还不走，”贝思低声说道。她连篮子带人抱住了乔。那种依恋的拥抱、充满爱意的神情使乔感到宽慰，尽管强烈的后悔使她想打自己的耳光，然后谦卑地去求卡罗尔婶婶给她这个恩惠，看着她如何优雅地接受它。 到艾美进门时，乔已经能加入全家的欢乐中去了。也许不完全是发自内心的，但是她没有对艾美的好运启发牢骚。那位年轻女士自己把这消息当作天大的喜讯。她欢天喜地又不乏稳重地着手准备，当晚便开始整理她的水彩颜料，收拾铅笔，把衣服、钱、护照之类的琐碎东西留给那些不像她那样热衷于艺术珍品的人们。 “这对我不光是旅游，姑娘们，”她忘情地说，一边收拢起她最好的调色板，“它将决定我的职业，因为如果我有才气的话，我会在罗马发现它的，并会以行动来证明。”“假如没有呢？”乔问。她眼睛红红地缝制着新领结，这个领结是给艾美的。 “那我就回家，教人画画谋生，”向往成名者沉着镇定地回答。但是想到这种远景，她做了个苦脸，然后不停地刮擦着她的调色板，好像在放弃希望前全副身心地采取着有力的措施。 “不，你不会的。你讨厌干重活。你会和某个富人结婚，然后回到家来整天尽享荣华富贵。”“你的预言有时会实现的。但是我不相信这个会实现。我肯定是希望它会实现的。因为，假如我自己当不了艺术家，我希望有能力帮助那些可以成为艺术家的人，”艾美笑着说，仿佛扮演乐善好施的女士比穷绘画教师的角色更适合她。 “哼！”乔叹道，”你希望这样，就会这样的。你的愿望总是能得到满足- 而我，从来得不到。”“你想去吗？”艾美问，她若有所思地用刀轻轻拍着鼻子。 “很想。” “那么，一两年左右，我会来请你的。我们一起到古罗马广场去看遗迹，实现我们定了那么多次的计划。”“谢谢！当那个快乐的日子到来时，我会让你想起你的许诺的，假如有那么一天的话，”乔回答。她尽可能愉快地接受了这个不确定的但却十分动人的提议。 没有多少时间作准备。屋子里一片混乱，直到艾美离开。 乔咬紧牙关坚持得很好，待到那飘动的蓝丝带消失，她退进自己的避难所- 阁楼，哭得不能自持。艾美同样勇敢地咬紧牙关坚持着，直到轮船起航。可是就在要撤舷梯的时候，她突然醒悟到，不多久她和那些深爱她的人将会被这个波涛翻滚的大海隔开。于是，她抱住最后一个送客劳里，抽泣着说 \"哦，为我照顾她们，万一发生了什么事- ”“我会的，亲爱的，万一有什么，我会来安慰你的，”劳里低声说，他做梦也没想到他后来会被请去履行他的诺言。 就这样，艾美乘船去探寻东半球。在年轻人眼里，那里是多么神奇、美丽呀！她的父亲和她的朋友站在岸边注视着她，热切地希望好运轻轻地降临在这个快乐的女孩身上。她向他们挥着手，他们目送着她，直到什么都看不见了，只有海面上耀眼的夏日阳光。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/91/7757.html","bookId":476,"book":{"id":476,"title":"Little
