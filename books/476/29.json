{"id":36020,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29 Calls","content":"\"Come, Jo, it\u0027s time.\" \"For what?\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today?\" \"I\u0027ve done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don\u0027t think I ever was mad enough to say I\u0027d make six calls in one day, when a single one upsets me for a week.\" \"Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us. I was to finish the crayon of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and return our neighbors\u0027 visits.\" \"If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the letter of my bond, Shylock. There is a pile of clouds in the east, it\u0027s not fair, and I don\u0027t go.\" \"Now, that\u0027s shirking. It\u0027s a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you pride yourself on keeping promises, so be honorable, come and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six months.\" At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking, for she was mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain, bribe, or promise. In the present instance there was no escape, and having clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she smelled thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready. \"Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You don\u0027t intend to make calls in that state, I hope,\" cried Amy, surveying her with amazement. \"Why not? I\u0027m neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day. If people care more for my clothes than they do for me, I don\u0027t wish to see them. You can dress for both, and be as elegant as you please. It pays for you to be fine. It doesn\u0027t for me, and furbelows only worry me.\" \"Oh, dear!\" sighed Amy, \"now she\u0027s in a contrary fit, and will drive me distracted before I can get her properly ready. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s no pleasure to me to go today, but it\u0027s a debt we owe society, and there\u0027s no one to pay it but you and me. I\u0027ll do anything for you, Jo, if you\u0027ll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil. You can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and behave so beautifully, if you try, that I\u0027m proud of you. I\u0027m afraid to go alone, do come and take care of me.\" \"You\u0027re an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old sister in that way. The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred, and your being afraid to go anywhere alone! I don\u0027t know which is the most absurd. Well, I\u0027ll go if I must, and do my best. You shall be commander of the expedition, and I\u0027ll obey blindly, will that satisfy you?\" said Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike submission. \"You\u0027re a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, and I\u0027ll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good impression. I want people to like you, and they would if you\u0027d only try to be a little more agreeable. Do your hair the pretty way, and put the pink rose in your bonnet. It\u0027s becoming, and you look too sober in your plain suit. Take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief. We\u0027ll stop at Meg\u0027s, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can have my dove-colored one.\" While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of countenance, saying meekly . . . \"I\u0027m perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, I die happy.\" \"You\u0027re highly satisfactory. Turn slowly round, and let me get a careful view.\" Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously, \"Yes, you\u0027ll do. Your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing. Hold back your shoulders, and carry your hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch. There\u0027s one thing you can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl. I can\u0027t, but it\u0027s very nice to see you, and I\u0027m so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one. It\u0027s simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly? I like to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose isn\u0027t.\" \"You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,\" said Jo, looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair. \"Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it up, please, ma\u0027am?\" \"Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house. The sweeping style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully. You haven\u0027t half buttoned one cuff, do it at once. You\u0027ll never look finished if you are not careful about the little details, for they make up the pleasing whole.\" Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing up her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as \u0027pretty as picters\u0027, Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window to watch them. \"Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so I want you to put on your best deportment. Don\u0027t make any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be calm, cool, and quiet, that\u0027s safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes,\" said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm. \"Let me see. \u0027Calm, cool, and quiet\u0027, yes, I think I can promise that. I\u0027ve played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I\u0027ll try it off. My powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy in your mind, my child.\" Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as silent as the sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her \u0027charming novel\u0027, and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera, and the fashions. Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a demure \"Yes\" or \"No\" with the chill on. In vain Amy telegraphed the word \u0027talk\u0027, tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with her foot. Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment like Maud\u0027s face, \u0027icily regular, splendidly null\u0027. \"What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!\" was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door closed upon their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall, but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo. \"How could you mistake me so? I merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone. Try to be sociable at the Lambs\u0027. Gossip as other girls do, and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up. They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to know, and I wouldn\u0027t fail to make a good impression there for anything.\" \"I\u0027ll be agreeable. I\u0027ll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and raptures over any trifle you like. I rather enjoy this, and now I\u0027ll imitate what is called \u0027a charming girl\u0027. I can do it, for I have May Chester as a model, and I\u0027ll improve upon her. See if the Lambs don\u0027t say, \u0027What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!\" Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop. Amy\u0027s face was a study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all the young ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to hear a long account of Lucretia\u0027s last attack, while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her. So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the lady. A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun. One may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation. \"She rides splendidly. Who taught her?\" \"No one. She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree. Now she rides anything, for she doesn\u0027t know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well. She has such a passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails, she can be a horsebreaker, and get her living so.\" At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady, which was her especial aversion. But what could she do? For the old lady was in the middle of her story, and long before it was done, Jo was off again, making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful blunders. \"Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone, and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"Which did she choose?\" asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who enjoyed the subject. \"None of them. She heard of a young horse at the farm house over the river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try, because he was handsome and spirited. Her struggles were really pathetic. There was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she took the saddle to the horse. My dear creature, she actually rowed it over the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man!\" \"Did she ride the horse?\" \"Of course she did, and had a capital time. I expected to see her brought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and was the life of the party.\" \"Well, I call that plucky!\" and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable. She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress. One of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness, \"Oh, Amy painted it. You can\u0027t buy those soft shades, so we paint ours any color we like. It\u0027s a great comfort to have an artistic sister.\" \"Isn\u0027t that an original idea?\" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun. \"That\u0027s nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There\u0027s nothing the child can\u0027t do. Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for Sallie\u0027s party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,\" added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister\u0027s accomplishments that exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her. \"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,\" observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady, who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed. Any mention of her \u0027works\u0027 always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a brusque remark, as now. \"Sorry you could find nothing better to read. I write that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it. Are you going to New York this winter?\" As Miss Lamb had \u0027enjoyed\u0027 the story, this speech was not exactly grateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake, but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their mouths. \"Amy, we must go. Good-by, dear, do come and see us. We are pining for a visit. I don\u0027t dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you should come, I don\u0027t think I shall have the heart to send you away.\" Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester\u0027s gushing style that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time. \"Didn\u0027t I do well?\" asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away. \"Nothing could have been worse,\" was Amy\u0027s crushing reply. \"What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?\" \"Why, it\u0027s funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so it\u0027s no use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season, and have things as easy and fine as they do.\" \"You needn\u0027t go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven\u0027t a bit of proper pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak,\" said Amy despairingly. Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors. \"How shall I behave here?\" she asked, as they approached the third mansion. \"Just as you please. I wash my hands of you,\" was Amy\u0027s short answer. \"Then I\u0027ll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we\u0027ll have a comfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution,\" returned Jo gruffly, being disturbed by her failure to suit. An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing. She listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that \"Tom Brown was a brick,\" regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired Frenchwoman. Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her heart\u0027s content. Mr. Tudor\u0027s uncle had married an English lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of March. It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad. For Jo sat on the grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related one of Laurie\u0027s pranks to her admiring audience. One small child was poking turtles with Amy\u0027s cherished parasol, a second was eating gingerbread over Jo\u0027s best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come again, \"It was such fun to hear about Laurie\u0027s larks.\" \"Capital boys, aren\u0027t they? I feel quite young and brisk again after that.\" said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol. \"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?\" asked Amy, wisely refraining from any comment upon Jo\u0027s dilapidated appearance. \"Don\u0027t like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his father, and doesn\u0027t speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie says he is fast, and I don\u0027t consider him a desirable acquaintance, so I let him alone.\" \"You might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool nod, and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain, whose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just reversed the nod and the bow, it would have been right,\" said Amy reprovingly. \"No, it wouldn\u0027t,\" returned Jo, \"I neither like, respect, nor admire Tudor, though his grandfather\u0027s uncle\u0027s nephew\u0027s niece was a third cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever. I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels.\" \"It\u0027s no use trying to argue with you,\" began Amy. \"Not the least, my dear,\" interrupted Jo, \"so let us look amiable, and drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I\u0027m deeply grateful.\" The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being told that the young ladies were engaged. \"Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today. We can run down there any time, and it\u0027s really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.\" \"Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt March likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call. It\u0027s a little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don\u0027t believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them. Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet.\" \"What a good girl you are, Amy!\" said Jo, with a repentant glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and spotless still. \"I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to please people as it is for you. I think of them, but it takes too much time to do them, so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and let the small ones slip, but they tell best in the end, I fancy.\" Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air, \"Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you\u0027d remember that, and practice it, you\u0027d be better liked than I am, because there is more of you.\" \"It\u0027s a greater not to be able to hide them. I don\u0027t mind saying that I don\u0027t approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I\u0027m not called upon to tell him so. Neither are you, and there is no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is.\" \"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any good, as I know to my sorrow, since I\u0027ve had Teddie to manage. But there are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word, and I say we ought to do it to others if we can.\" \"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can\u0027t be taken as a sample of other boys,\" said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have convulsed the \u0027remarkable boy\u0027 if he had heard it. \"If we were belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don\u0027t approve of them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn\u0027t have a particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and puritanical.\" \"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That\u0027s a nice sort of morality.\" \"I can\u0027t argue about it, I only know that it\u0027s the way of the world, and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their pains. I don\u0027t like reformers, and I hope you never try to be one.\" \"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the laughing the world would never get on without them. We can\u0027t agree about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new. You will get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.\" \"Well, compose yourself now, and don\u0027t worry Aunt with your new ideas.\" \"I\u0027ll try not to, but I\u0027m always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her. It\u0027s my doom, and I can\u0027t help it.\" They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their nieces. Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper and pleased everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind. This amiable spirit was felt at once, and both aunts \u0027my deared\u0027 her affectionately, looking what they afterward said emphatically, \"That child improves every day.\" \"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well in the young. \"Yes, Aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a table, as I have nothing but my time to give.\" \"I\u0027m not,\" put in Jo decidedly. \"I hate to be patronized, and the Chesters think it\u0027s a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy, they only want you to work.\" \"I am willing to work. It\u0027s for the freedmen as well as the Chesters, and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun. Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.\" \"Quite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear. It\u0027s a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts. Some do not, and that is trying,\" observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression. If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but unfortunately, we don\u0027t have windows in our breasts, and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends. Better for us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper. By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue. \"I don\u0027t like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave. I\u0027d rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.\" \"Ahem!\" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March. \"I told you so,\" said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol. Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting. \"Do you speak French, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy\u0027s. \"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often as I like,\" replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old lady to smile affably. \"How are you about languages?\" asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo. \"Don\u0027t know a word. I\u0027m very stupid about studying anything, can\u0027t bear French, it\u0027s such a slippery, silly sort of language,\" was the brusque reply. Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy, \"You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe? Eyes don\u0027t trouble you any more, do they?\" \"Not at all, thank you, ma\u0027am. I\u0027m very well, and mean to do great things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that joyful time arrives.\" \"Good girl! You deserve to go, and I\u0027m sure you will some day,\" said Aunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her ball for her. Crosspatch, draw the latch, Sit by the fire and spin, squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into Jo\u0027s face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing. \"Most observing bird,\" said the old lady. \"Come and take a walk, my dear?\" cried Polly, hopping toward the china closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar. \"Thank you, I will. Come Amy.\" and Jo brought the visit to an end, feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution. She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine, which impression caused Aunt March to say, as they vanished . . . \"You\u0027d better do it, Mary. I\u0027ll supply the money.\" and Aunt Carrol to reply decidedly, \"I certainly will, if her father and mother consent.\" “走呀，乔，到时间了。” “做什么？” “你答应今天和我一起走访六家人的，你不会忘了吧？”“我这一生是做过许多鲁莽的傻事，可我不会发神经，说我要一天拜访六户人家吧。访一家都让我烦一个星期。”“是的，你是说过。那是我俩的协议。我替你完成贝思的铅笔画像，你好好地和我一起去邻居家回访。”“假如天气好--协议中有这一条，我严格遵守协议，夏洛克。东边有一大块乌云，天气不好，所以我不去。”“你这是偷懒。天气不错，不会下雨的，你不是以守约自豪吗？讲点信用吧，去尽你的义务，然后你又可以安心过六个月。”那一时刻，乔正特别沉迷于缝制衣服。她为全家人做大衣并居功自傲，因为她的针使得和笔一样好。可她正在首次试穿她缝的新衣就给抓差，受命在七月的热天里盛装出访，真叫人光火。她讨厌任何正式的出访，除非艾美和她订协议，贿赂她，或者许愿，如此这般胁她，否则她决不会干的。眼下这种情形是逃脱不掉的了。她恨恨地将剪刀弄出响声，声辩她觉察到了雷雨的迹象，可还是投降了。她收起针线，拿起帽子、手套，告诉艾美她这个遭难者已做好准备。 “乔·马奇，你真够倔的，圣人也要被你激怒。我希望你不是打算就这样出访吧？”艾美打量着她，惊叫起来。 “怎么不行？我觉得齐整、凉爽、舒适。热天里尘土飞扬的，这样穿戴很合适。要是人们更在乎我的衣服而不是我这个人，我就不愿见他们。你可以尽心尽意打扮得优雅，让人们喜欢你，喜欢你的衣服。你觉得这样挺值，我却不然，裙饰只能让我烦。”“哦，天哪！”艾美叹了口气。”她现在处于逆反情绪中，不等我把她弄妥贴，她会让我发狂的。今天出门肯定不会是件好差事。可是，我们欠了社交债呀。除了你我，家里没人去还这笔债。乔，你只需好好打扮一下，帮我回礼，我会为你做任何事的。你很会说话，打扮起来很有贵族气质，举止也很潇洒，只要你乐意。我会为你骄傲的。我害怕一个人去，你一定要和我一起去，照顾我。“你这个小姑娘真有手腕。那样子甜言蜜语哄骗你脾气坏的姐姐。真想得出来，我有贵族气，有教养，你一个人哪也不敢去！真不知哪一个更荒唐。好啦，既然我非得去就去吧，我尽力而为。你来当这次远征的统帅吧，我绝对服从，满意了吗？”乔说，她的态度由倔强突然转变为绵羊似的顺从。 “你真是个天使！现在，去穿上你最好的衣服，我会教你做到举止得体的，这样你就会给人留下好印象。我希望别人喜欢你，而你只要试着随和一点，就能让人喜欢，头发弄漂亮点，帽子上放一朵粉红色玫瑰。你穿着素净衣服看上去太严肃了，这样相称些。带上你的淡黄手套和绣花手绢。我们在梅格家停一下，把她的白阳伞借来，这样，你就可以用我那把鸽灰色阳伞了。”艾美一边打扮，一边发着命令，乔不无抗议地服从着。她叹着气，窸窸窣窣地穿上她的新玻璃纱衣，皱着眉，将帽带系成个无可挑剔的结。她手忙脚乱地弄着别针，戴上领结，扯出手绢时，全身衣服都给扯皱了。手绢上的刺绣让她鼻子很不舒服，就像眼前的出访使命让她一样难受。作为优雅打扮的最后装饰，她将手挤进了那双有三个钮扣和流苏的手套。她转向艾美，脸上带着憨憨的表情，谦恭地说 “我太痛苦了，可你要是觉得我这样能拿得出去，我死而无憾。”“你太让人满意了。慢慢转过来，让我仔细瞧瞧。”乔转了个身，艾美这里修一下，那里补一下，然后后退一步，歪着头宽厚地打量着她。”行，能行。你的头打扮得最合我意。 红玫瑰点缀着白帽子真是迷人。挺起肩来，别管手套是不是挤手，手放自如些。你再加件东西会更好，乔。也就是，围条披肩--我围着不好，你围合适。真高兴，马奇婶婶把那条可爱的披肩给你了。它虽然朴素，可是很好看，落在胳膊上的褶子真是风雅。你看我斗篷上的针绣花边在不在中间？我衣服可扣整齐了？我想让人看看我的靴子，因为，我的脚确实很美，尽管我的鼻子不理想。”“你是个美丽的小东西，永远快乐，”乔说。她带着权威的神气透过手看着艾美插在金发上的蓝色羽饰。”请问夫人，我是把好衣服放下来扫着尘地，还是卷起来？”“走路的时候就卷起来，进了屋子就放下来。裙褶拖曳的风格最适合你，你得学着优雅地拖着裙裾。你一只袖口没全扣上，赶快扣上。要是不注意这些细节，你根本不会完美的，悦人的整体形象就是由细节组成的。”乔叹了口气，开始扣袖子，手套上的扣子差点给绷掉。两个人终于打扮完毕上路了。罕娜从楼上窗户探出身子看着她们，说她俩\"漂亮得像图中人\"。 “哎，乔，亲爱的，切斯特一家以为她们非常优雅，所以，我想让你拿出最好的风度来。别说你那些粗暴的话，别做怪事，好不好？只要沉着、冷静、镇定 -那样保险，又有女士风度，你很容易在十五分钟内做到这些的，”艾美说。她们已去过梅格家，借了白阳桑梅格一手抱一个孩子检查了她们的装扮。现在她们已到了要访问的第一家。 “我想想。\u0027沉着、冷静、镇定\u0027 好的，我想可以答应你。我在舞台上扮演过一个古板的年轻女士，我来试试。你会看到，我很有能耐的。脑子放松一些，我的孩子。”艾美松了口气。调皮的乔奉行了她的话。在第一家，她坐在那儿，四肢放得优雅舒适，裙褶垂到恰到好处。她平静得像夏天的海，冷得像大雪堆，沉默得像狮身人面像。切斯特夫人提到她的\"动人的小说\"，切斯特小姐们挑起话头，谈舞会、野餐、歌剧以及服装款式，均告无效。乔要么笑笑，要么点点头，再不就严肃地说声\"是\"、\"不\"，以此回答所有的问题，让人扫兴。艾美向她传去\"说话“的指令，试图把她从这种状态中拖出来，还用脚偷偷踹她，还是不起作用。乔无动于衷地坐在那里好像什么也不知道，举止如同莫德的脸：“匀称却冷冰冰，没有表情却光彩照人。”“马奇家大小姐多么高傲又令人乏味啊！”送走客人关上门，一个小姐评论道，不幸给客人听见了。乔无声地笑着穿过大厅，可是艾美为她的指挥失误怄着气，自然怪罪起来乔来。 “你怎么能这样误解我的意思？我只是要你表现得端庄、稳重，可你整个儿一个木头疙瘩。到兰姆家可要随和些了。你要像别的女孩们那样闲聊，对服装、调笑、管它什么废话都要表现出兴趣。她们出入于上流社会，认识她们对我们很有用。我无论如何都要给她们留下好印象。”“我会放随和些的，我会闲聊，傻笑，听到你喜欢的任何琐事都惊叹狂呼。我很喜欢那样。现在，我得模仿所谓的\u0027迷人的女孩\u0027，有梅·切斯特做样板，我再改进些，是能做好的。等着瞧，兰姆一家会说：\u0027 乔·马奇多么可爱、迷人呀！\u0027\"艾美完全有理由着急，因为一旦乔异想天开起来，不知道她什么时候才能收得祝艾美看着她姐姐轻快地走进下一个客厅，热情奔放地亲吻了所有的年轻女士，优雅地朝年轻先生们微笑，兴致勃勃地加入了闲聊，这种情绪使艾美这个旁观者大为惊讶，她一脸困惑。兰姆太太占住了艾美。她很喜欢艾美，迫使艾美听她长篇大论地讲述卢克丽霞的最后反抗，同时，三个愉快的年轻先生守候在近处，等着兰姆太太一住口，就冲上去救艾美出来。在这种情形下，艾美无力制止乔。乔似乎被淘气的精灵缠住了，她像兰姆老太一样滔滔不绝，说个不停。好几个脑袋围着她，艾美竖起耳朵想听听她在说什么，因为断断续续的话语使她充满疑惧，圆睁的眼睛和上举的手折磨着她的好奇心，不断的笑声使她极想分享乐趣。听听这种谈话的评断，我们可以想像出艾美的痛苦。 “她马骑得特棒--谁教她的？” “没人教。她过去常在安在一棵树上的旧马鞍上练习上马、握缰、骑马。现在，她什么都敢骑，她不知道什么叫害怕。马夫给她马骑，要价便宜，因为她把马驯得服服贴贴，让女士骑没问题。她骑马的热情太大，我常对她说，假如她做别的事不成，可以当个驯马师来谋生。”听到这种糟糕的话，艾美很难克制住自己了，因为，这种话给人留下她是荡妇的印象，而这又是她特别讨厌的。可是，她能怎么办呢？老太太故事刚说了一半。就在故事还远远没结束的时候，乔又开始了，讲出更可笑的秘密，出现了更可怕的错。 “是的，艾美那天真是倒霉，所有的好马都不在，留下来三匹，一匹跛，一匹瞎，还有一匹太顽劣，往它嘴里塞泥它才走。游园会用这种马不错，是不是？”“她选了哪一匹呢？”一个先生笑着问，他喜欢这个话题。 “一匹也没眩她听说河对面农家有一匹好马，又精神又漂亮，虽然还没有女士骑过它，艾美决定一试。那场斗争真是悲壮，没人给马上鞍，她自己上。我的天哪！她竟然带着马划过了河，给马上鞍，来到谷仓，使老头大大吃了一惊。”“她骑那马了吗？”“当然。她玩得非常开心。我还以为她会给弄得残缺不全地送回来呢。可是她完全制服了那马，成了游园会的中心人物。”“嗯，那真叫有胆量！”小兰姆先生赞许地瞥了一眼艾美，奇怪她妈妈说些什么，把那女孩羞得满脸通红，浑身不自在。 过了一会儿，谈话突然转了向，谈到衣服问题，艾美的脸更红了，也更不自在了。一个年轻女士询问乔，她去野餐时戴的那顶淡褐色帽子是在哪里买的。傻乎乎的乔不提两年前买帽子的地方，而是毫无必要地坦诚相告：“噢，是艾美涂上去的。买不到那些柔和颜色的，所以我们想要什么颜色就涂什么颜色。有一个懂艺术的妹妹是个很大的安慰。”“这主意真是新奇！”兰姆小姐叫起来，她发现乔很有趣。 “和她做的别的伟绩相比，这算不了什么。没有这孩子干不了的事。瞧，她想要双蓝靴子参加萨莉的舞会，她就把她那双泥乎乎的白靴子涂成最可爱的天蓝色，看上去真像缎子做的，”乔带着对妹妹成就的自豪感补充道，这激怒了艾美，她恨不能用名片盒砸她才解气。 “前些日子，我们读了你写的一个故事，非常喜欢，”兰姆大小姐说道，她想恭维文学女士。必须承认，当时这位文学女士看上去一点也没那气质。 一提及她的\"作品\"，总会对乔产生不好的影响，她要么严肃起来，像是谁冒犯了她，要么唐突地转变话题，现在就是这样。”真遗憾你们找不到更好的东西来读，我写那废话是因为它有销路。普通老百姓才喜欢它。今年冬天你去纽约吗？“因为兰姆小姐\"喜欢\"这故事，所以乔的话显得不太文雅，也不客气。话一出口，乔便意识到了自己的错误。可是，由于担心把事情弄得更糟，她突然记起该先提出告辞，于是贸然提出要走，使得其他三个人话没说完，噎在了喉咙。 “艾美，我们得走了。再见，亲爱的，一定上我们家来玩，盼着你们来访。我不敢请您，兰姆先生。但要是您真的来了，我想我没有胆量打发您走的。”乔滑稽地模仿着梅·切斯特的风格，极动感情地说完那些话。艾美尽快出了屋，搞得哭笑不得。 “我干得不错吧？”她们离开时，乔满意地问道。 “没有比这更糟的人，”艾美的回答斩钉截铁，”你让什么迷住了，竟说起那些故事来？什么马鞍、帽子、靴子的，还有其他那些？”“哎呀，那些好玩，逗人笑。他们知道我们穷，没有必要假装我们有马夫，一季买三四顶帽子，还能像他们那样轻而易举地得到好东西。”“你也不必把我们的小计谋告诉他们呀，也没必要那样暴露我们的贫穷。你一点儿正当的自尊都没有，从来不知道什么时候该闭口，什么时候该出言，”艾美绝望地说。 可怜的乔感到羞愧了。她默默地用干硬的手绢擦着鼻尖，仿佛在为她干的坏事忏悔。 “在这里我该怎么做？”当她们走近第三家时，乔问。 “想怎么做就怎么做，我可不管你了，”艾美简短地答道。 “那我就会玩得快活罗。那些男孩们在家，我们会很开心的。天知道，我需要点变化了。优雅不适合我的性格，”乔态度生硬地回敬。她老是不能让艾美满意，心中恼火。 三个大男孩和几个可爱的小孩子热情地欢迎她，这迅速扫除了她的不快。她由着艾美去和女主人及碰巧同样来访的图德先生应酬，自己则和年轻人们打成了一片。她发现这样的变化使人精神振奋。她怀着极大的兴趣倾听着大学生的故事，一声不吭地抚摸着猎狗和长卷毛狗，完全赞同\"汤姆·布朗是条好汉\"，也不管这种赞许的不恰当。当一个小伙子提议去看看他的鱼池时，乔欣然从命。她笨拙却充满柔情地拥抱了一下慈爱的夫人，把帽子弄毁了。这顶帽子对她来说非常亲切，有灵感的法国女人做出的头饰也不及它。夫人一边为她整理着帽子，一边不由笑起她来。 艾美让乔自行其事，开始自己尽情寻欢了。图德先生的叔叔娶了个英国女士，这位女士是一个还在世的勋爵相隔三代的表妹。艾美非常尊敬这一家人，因为，尽管她生于美国，有着美国的教养，她对爵位还是怀着崇敬之心，这种崇敬萦绕着我们中间优秀分子的脑际--那是一种未被认可的、早先信仰国王的忠诚。几年前，一位皇室的金发女士一踏上这太阳底下最民主的国度，这种忠诚便使得这个国家骚动起来。 这个年轻的国家对那些古老的国家所怀有的热爱仍然与这种忠诚相关，如同一个大儿子对一个专横的小妈妈的爱，小妈妈有能力时，拢着儿子，儿子反抗了便责骂着放行。然而，即使心满意足地和英国贵族的远亲攀谈也没能使艾美忘掉时间。她极不情愿地抽身离开这贵族社会，到处寻找乔。她热切希望不会发现她那不可救药的姐姐又处于使马奇姓氏蒙羞的局面。 情况本可以说更糟，不过艾美觉得还能接受。乔坐在草地上，身边围了一群男孩，一只爪子脏兮兮的狗横卧在她那条华丽的、节日才穿的裙子上。她正对那群面带羡慕之情的听众叙述劳里的一个恶作剧。一个小孩子用艾美珍爱的阳伞捣弄着乌龟们，另一个把姜饼放在乔最好的帽子上大嚼，还有一个戴着她的手套在玩球。所有的人都很开心。乔收拾起她那些弄毁的财产准备走时，她的护卫送着她，恳求她再来做客：“听劳里的玩笑太有趣了。”“这些男孩子太棒了，是不是？和他们待过后，我又觉得相当年轻、活泼了，”乔说。她将手放在背后信步走着，一半是习惯使然，另一半是想藏起被溅污的阳桑\"你为什么老躲着图德先生？”艾美问。她明智地克制着不评论乔损毁了的形象。 “我不喜欢他。他摆架子，斥责他的妹妹们，烦他爸爸，说话不尊重他妈妈。劳里说他放荡。我看他不是个理想的熟人，所以不睬他。”“至少，你该待他礼貌些吧。你只对他冷冷地点点头，而刚才你那样彬彬有礼地向汤米·张伯伦弯腰微笑，他爸只是个开杂货店的。你只要把这点头和弯腰掉个个儿，就对了，”艾美责怪道。 “不，不对，”倔强的乔回答，”即使图德爷爷的叔叔的侄儿的侄女是一个勋爵的第三代表妹，我也不会喜欢他，更不羡慕他。汤米穷，害羞，可是他善良，非常聪明。我看重地，我愿意表现出来。尽管他和那些牛纸包裹打交道，他还是一个绅士。”“和你争辩没用，”艾美说。 “是一点没用，亲爱的，”乔打断了她，”所以，我们放温和些，在这里丢下一张名片，因为很明显金家人不在家，我为此深表谢意。”马奇家名片盒完成使命，两个姑娘继续前进。到达第五家时，她们被告知年轻女士们有约会，乔又谢起恩来。 “现在让我们回家吧，今天别去管马奇婶婶了。我们什么时候都能跑到她家去。现在又累又躁，还要拖着最好的一套衣服在泥地里走，真是太遗憾了。”“你愿意的话就这样想吧。婶婶喜欢我们打扮入时地正式拜访她，向她表示敬意。这是小事一桩，但却让她快乐。我相信，这不会像那些脏狗和那群男孩子那样弄脏你的衣服，一点也不会。弯下腰来，我替你拿掉帽子上的碎屑。”“艾美，你真是个好姑娘！”乔说。她懊恼地瞥了一眼自己弄糟了的衣服，又瞥了一下妹妹的，那衣服依旧干干净净、一尘不染。”我希望我能像你一样轻而易举地做些小事让人喜欢。我想过，但做那些太费时间，所以，我等待机会施舍大恩惠，小事就由它过去了。不过我想，最终还是小事最有效果。”艾美笑了，即刻软了下来，带着母亲般的神情说道：“妇女应该学会与人相处，特别是穷妇人，因为没有别的办法来回报别人给你的好处。如果你愿意记住这一点，练习练习，你会比我更惹人喜爱，因为你的好气质更多。”“我是个有怪癖的老东西，将来还会是这样，但是我愿意承认你是对的，只是我可以为一个人冒生命危险，但要我违心地讨好一个人我却办不到。我这样强烈地爱憎分明，真是不幸，是不是？”“要是不能隐瞒这种感情就更不幸了。我不在乎说出来，和你一样我也不赞成图德，但是，没人请我把这告诉图德，也没人请你。没有必要因为他讨人厌便把自己弄得不受欢迎。”“可是我认为，姑娘们在不喜欢某个年轻人的时候应该表露出来。除了用态度还能用什么表露呢？很遗憾，如我所知，说教是无益的，就像我对待特迪那样。但是我有许多小办法，可以用来不加言语地影响他。我说，如果可以的话，我们对其他人也应该这样。“特迪是个出众的男孩，不能用作其他男孩的榜样。”艾美的语调严肃认真、深信不疑。如果那\" 出众的男孩\"听见这句话，一定会大笑不止。”假如我们是美女，或者是有钱有势的女人，也许能做些什么。可是对我们来说，因为不赞成那一帮年轻先生就对他们皱着眉，一点效果也没有。我们只能被人家看作古怪、拘谨。“所以我们就鼓励那些我们讨厌的东西和人，仅仅因为我们不是美女，不是百万富翁，是吗？这种说教真不错。”“我辩不了，我只知道这是处世方式。违背它的人反而白白让人嘲笑。我不喜欢改革家，希望你也不要去当改革家。”“我就是喜欢改革家，要是能够，我愿当一个改革家。因为尽管受人嘲笑，这世界没有改革家就不能运转。我们俩观点达不成一致。你属于旧派，我属于新派。你按你的方式会过得很好，但我也能过得非常愉快。我想，我倒是欣赏那些指责与呵斥。”“好了，安静下来吧。别用你那些新念头去烦婶婶。”“我尽量不烦她。可是，在她面前，我总是鬼迷心窍地说出一些特别直率的话，或者生出标新立异的念头。这是我的命，我逃不了。”她们发现卡罗尔婶婶和老太太在一起，两个人正一门心思地谈论着什么非常有趣的事。姑娘们一进门，她们便停下话头，脸上的表情明显表明她们一直在谈论着她们的侄女们。 乔心情不好，犟劲又上来了，而艾美善良地尽了自己的责任，忍着气讨大家的欢心。她完全处于一种天使般的心境中，而这种温和可爱的性情马上感染了大家。两个婶婶慈爱地唤她\"我亲爱的\"，一边用眼色表示她们后来强调的：“那孩子每天都有长进。”“你要去为交易会帮忙吗，亲爱的？”卡罗尔太太回。艾美带着信任的神情在她身旁坐下，老年人非常喜欢年轻人的这种神情。 “是的，婶婶，切斯特夫人问我可愿帮忙。我提出照看一张桌子，因为除了时间，我没什么东西可以给人了。”“我可不去，”乔断然插了嘴，”我讨厌受人恩惠。切斯特家人以为，让我们为他们那与上流社会有联系的交易会帮忙是个了不起的恩惠。我不知道你答应了，艾美，他们只想要你干活。”“我愿意干活。交易会是为切斯特家办的，也是为自由民的。我觉得他们太客气了，让我也分担工作，分享乐趣。恩惠只要是善意的，就不会烦扰我。”“相当正确、恰当。亲爱的，我喜欢你感恩的精神。帮助那些欣赏我们努力的人是件愉快的事，而有些人不欣赏，令人气愤，”马奇婶婶从眼镜上看着乔，评论道。乔皱着眉头坐在摇椅里摇着。 要是乔知道巨大的幸福在她和艾美之间晃来晃去难以平衡，而只能降在一个人头上的话，她会迅即变得鸽子般温顺。 然而，不幸的是，我们的心灵没有窗户，看不见我们朋友脑中有些什么。在一般的事情上，看不见还好些。可是，看见了时常是莫大的安慰，能节约时间，也能抑制脾气。乔的下一句话剥夺了她几年的快乐，使她及时地领教到了闭嘴的艺术。 “我不喜欢恩惠。它们压制我，让我感到像个奴隶。我宁愿一切自己干，完完全全自立。”“嗯！”卡罗尔婶婶轻轻咳了咳，看了看马奇婶婶。 “我和你这么说过，”马奇婶婶说，她坚定地朝卡罗尔婶婶点了点头。 乔神气活现地坐在那里摇着，那态度决非是想引人注目，只是她意识不到她做了些什么，对她倒算是仁慈。 “你会说法语吗，亲爱的？”卡罗尔婶婶将手放在艾美身上，问道。 “说得不错，多亏马奇婶婶。她让埃丝特尽着我意经常和我说，”艾美带着感激的神色回答，换来了老太太可掬的笑容。 “你法语怎么样？”卡罗尔太太问乔。 “一个字也不会。我学什么都太笨。我受不了法语，那是种滑溜溜、傻乎乎的语言，”她无礼地答道。 两个老太太又交换了一个眼色。马奇婶婶对艾美说：“你现在身体相当不错，是吗？眼睛不再难受了，对不对？”“一点也不难受了。谢谢您，夫人。我很好。我打算明年冬天干些大事。这样，什么时候那令人高兴的时刻来临，我就可以做好去罗马的准备。”“好姑娘！你配去那里，我肯定有一天你能去成的，”马奇婶婶赞许地拍着她的头说，艾美为她拾起了线团。 淘气的孩子，插上窗闩， 坐在火边，纺着棉纱。 鹦哥怪叫起来，它栖息在乔坐的椅子背上，弯着头窥视着乔的脸，无礼的质询神情十分滑稽，让人忍俊不禁。 “这鸟观察力真强，”老太太说。 “一起去散散步，亲爱的？”鹦哥叫道，它朝瓷器橱跳去，神情暗示着要糖块。 “谢谢，我就去。来吧，艾美。”乔结束了拜访，她更强烈地感到出访确实对她的性格不适合。她以绅士般的风度和婶婶们握手道别，而艾美却吻别她们。两个姑娘离开了，身后留下阴影与阳光，这印象使得马奇婶婶在她们背影消失后作出了决定 “你最好干吧，玛丽，我会提供钱的。”接着卡罗尔婶婶坚定地回答：“我当然会干，如果她爸爸妈妈同意。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/91/7756.html","bookId":476,"book":{"id":476,"title":"Little Women小妇人","description":"简介：
