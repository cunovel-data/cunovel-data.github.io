{"id":36035,"no":44,"title":"Chapter 44 My Lord And Lady","content":"\"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour? The luggage has come, and I\u0027ve been making hay of Amy\u0027s Paris finery, trying to find some things I want,\" said Laurie, coming in the next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother\u0027s lap, as if being made \u0027the baby\u0027 again.\\n\\n \"Certainly. Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this,\" and Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring, as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.\\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t have come over if I could have helped it, but I can\u0027t get on without my little woman any more than a . . .\"\\n\\n \"Weathercock can without the wind,\" suggested Jo, as he paused for a simile. Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came home.\\n\\n \"Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven\u0027t had an easterly spell since I was married. Don\u0027t know anything about the north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?\"\\n\\n \"Lovely weather so far. I don\u0027t know how long it will last, but I\u0027m not afraid of storms, for I\u0027m learning how to sail my ship. Come home, dear, and I\u0027ll find your bootjack. I suppose that\u0027s what you are rummaging after among my things. Men are so helpless, Mother,\" said Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her husband.\\n\\n \"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?\" asked Jo, buttoning Amy\u0027s cloak as she used to button her pinafores.\\n\\n \"We have our plans. We don\u0027t mean to say much about them yet, because we are such very new brooms, but we don\u0027t intend to be idle. I\u0027m going into business with a devotion that shall delight Grandfather, and prove to him that I\u0027m not spoiled. I need something of the sort to keep me steady. I\u0027m tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.\"\\n\\n \"And Amy, what is she going to do?\" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at Laurie\u0027s decision and the energy with which he spoke.\\n\\n \"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall exert over the world at large. That\u0027s about it, isn\u0027t it, Madame Recamier?\" asked Laurie with a quizzical look at Amy.\\n\\n \"Time will show. Come away, Impertinence, and don\u0027t shock my family by calling me names before their faces,\" answered Amy, resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon as a queen of society.\\n\\n \"How happy those children seem together!\" observed Mr. March, finding it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple had gone.\\n\\n \"Yes, and I think it will last,\" added Mrs. March, with the restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.\\n\\n \"I know it will. Happy Amy!\" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.\\n\\n Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, \"Mrs. Laurence.\"\\n\\n \"My Lord!\"\\n\\n \"That man intends to marry our Jo!\"\\n\\n \"I hope so, don\u0027t you, dear?\"\\n\\n \"Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer.\"\\n\\n \"Now, Laurie, don\u0027t be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love one another it doesn\u0027t matter a particle how old they are nor how poor. Women never should marry for money . . .\" Amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with malicious gravity . . .\\n\\n \"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes. If my memory serves me, you once thought it your duty to make a rich match. That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a good-for-nothing like me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, my dearest boy, don\u0027t, don\u0027t say that! I forgot you were rich when I said \u0027Yes\u0027. I\u0027d have married you if you hadn\u0027t a penny, and I sometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I love you.\" And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond in private, gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be once, do you? It would break my heart if you didn\u0027t believe that I\u0027d gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your living by rowing on the lake.\"\\n\\n \"Am I an idiot and a brute? How could I think so, when you refused a richer man for me, and won\u0027t let me give you half I want to now, when I have the right? Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to think it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the daughter was true to the mother\u0027s teaching. I told Mamma so yesterday, and she looked as glad and grateful as if I\u0027d given her a check for a million, to be spent in charity. You are not listening to my moral remarks, Mrs. Laurence,\" and Laurie paused, for Amy\u0027s eyes had an absent look, though fixed upon his face.\\n\\n \"Yes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time. I don\u0027t wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I\u0027m prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money. Don\u0027t laugh, but your nose is such a comfort to me,\" and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature with artistic satisfaction.\\n\\n Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his wife\u0027s peculiar taste, while she said slowly, \"May I ask you a question, dear?\"\\n\\n \"Of course, you may.\"\\n\\n \"Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s the trouble is it? I thought there was something in the dimple that didn\u0027t quite suit you. Not being a dog in the manger, but the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo\u0027s wedding with a heart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my darling?\"\\n\\n Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied. Her little jealous fear vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and confidence.\\n\\n \"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn\u0027t we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?\" said Laurie, when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.\\n\\n \"Jo would find us out, and spoil it all. She is very proud of him, just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing.\"\\n\\n \"Bless her dear heart! She won\u0027t think so when she has a literary husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support. We won\u0027t interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in spite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she believes in people\u0027s paying their honest debts, so I\u0027ll get round her in that way.\"\\n\\n \"How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn\u0027t it? That was always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely, and thanks to you, the dream has come true.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, we\u0027ll do quantities of good, won\u0027t we? There\u0027s one sort of poverty that I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won\u0027t ask, and people don\u0027t dare to offer charity. Yet there are a thousand ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend. I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar. I suppose it\u0027s wrong, but I do, though it is harder.\"\\n\\n \"Because it takes a gentleman to do it,\" added the other member of the domestic admiration society.\\n\\n \"Thank you, I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t deserve that pretty compliment. But I was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid fellows, some of them, working like heros, poor and friendless, but so full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself, and longed to give them a right good lift. Those are people whom it\u0027s a satisfaction to help, for if they\u0027ve got genius, it\u0027s an honor to be allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot boiling. If they haven\u0027t, it\u0027s a pleasure to comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it out.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, indeed, and there\u0027s another class who can\u0027t ask, and who suffer in silence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid in the old story. Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see youth, health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a little help at the right minute. People have been very kind to me, and whenever I see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put out my hand and help them, as I was helped.\"\\n\\n \"And so you shall, like an angel as you are!\" cried Laurie, resolving, with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies. \"Rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their money accumulate for others to waste. It\u0027s not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive, and enjoy making one\u0027s fellow creatures happy with it. We\u0027ll have a good time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste. Will you be a little Dorcas, going about emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with good deeds?\"\\n\\n \"With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin, stopping as you ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!\"\\n\\n So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again, feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more uprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough ways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they.\\n\\n \\n\\n “母亲大人，请将我妻子借给我半小时行吗？行李到了，我在找一些我要的东西，把艾美的漂亮衣服全翻乱了，”第二天，劳里进来说。他发现劳伦斯太太坐在妈妈的膝上，好像又成了\"宝宝\"。\\n\\n “当然行，去吧，亲爱的。我忘了你除了这个家还有个家。”马奇太太按了按那白皙的戴着结婚戒指的手，仿佛为她母性的贪爱请求原谅。\\n\\n “我要是能应付，就不会过来了。可是，没有我的小女人，我就没法生活，就像一个-”“没有风的风向标，”劳里停住找比喻的时候，乔提示道。\\n\\n 自打特迪回来，乔恢复了活泼的老样子。\\n\\n “没错。大部分时候艾美让我向西，只是偶尔朝南，结婚以来我还没有朝向过东，北面我是一无所知。但是我觉得那完全有益健康，适得其所。嘿，夫人！”“至今为止天气不错。我不知道这能持续多久。可是我不怕风暴，因为我在学着怎样驾驶我的船。回家吧，亲爱的，我给你找脱靴器，我猜你在我的东西里翻找的就是它。妈妈，真是拿男人们没办法，”艾美带着主妇似的神气说，这使她丈夫欢喜。\\n\\n “你们安定下来后，打算做些什么呢？”乔问，她在给艾美扣着斗篷扣，就像以前为她扣围裙那样。\\n\\n “我们有计划。我们还不打算大事张扬，因为我们刚刚成家。但我们不打算虚掷时光。我将专心致志地去经商，这样会让爷爷高兴。我要向他证明我没给宠坏。我需要这样使自己稳定下来。我厌倦了无所事事，得像个真正的男人那样地工作。“艾美呢？她打算做什么？”马奇太太问。劳里说话时的决然神情与活力使她非常高兴。\\n\\n “我们向四邻尽过礼仪，展示过我们最好的帽子后，将在家里广延宾客，让上流的社交界为之注目，给我们带来良好的社会声望，到时让你们大吃一惊。就这样，是不是，雷卡米耶夫人？”劳里神情滑稽地看着艾美问道。\\n\\n “时间会证明的。走吧，你这莽汉。别当我家人的面骂我，让他们吃惊，”艾美回答。她打定主意，家里先得有个好妻子，然后她才能作为社交王后建立一个沙龙。\\n\\n “这两个孩子在一起似乎多幸福啊！”马奇先生说。小俩口走后，他发现很难再专心于地的亚里斯多德了。\\n\\n “是的，我看这幸福能持久，”马奇太太补充道。她神色平静，就像领航员将船安全地引入了港口。\\n\\n “我知道会持久的，幸福的艾美！”乔叹了口气。然后，随着巴尔教授急躁地推门进屋，她欢快地笑了。\\n\\n 晚上迟些时候，劳里脑子里放下了脱靴器之事。艾美转来转去，摆放着她的新艺术珍品。突然劳里对妻子说：“劳伦斯太太。”“夫君！”“那个人打算娶我们的乔！”“我希望这样，你呢，亲爱的？”“嗯，宝贝，我看他是个好人，按照那个富有表现力的词语的绝对意义，是这样。但是我真的希望他稍稍年轻些，大大富有些。”“哎唷，劳里，别太挑剔，别太世俗。只要他们相爱，不管多老多穷，都没一点儿关系。女人们决不能为钱嫁人”话一出口，艾美突然噎住了，她看着丈夫，而他故作严肃地答腔了。\\n\\n “当然不能，尽管有时确实能听到迷人的姑娘说她们打算这样做。要是我记得不错的话，你曾经认为嫁个富人就是你的责任。也许这能说明你为什么嫁给我这样一无是处的家伙。”“哦，我最亲爱的男孩。别，别那样说！当我说\u0027愿意\u0027时，忘了你是有钱人。即使你一文不名，我也会嫁给你的。我有时希望你是穷人，我好表示出我多么爱你，”艾美说。在公众场合她很庄重，私下却充满柔情。她令人信服地证实了她话语的真实性。\\n\\n “你没有当真以为我唯利是图，像我曾试着做的那样，是不是？要是你不相信我乐意与你同舟，哪怕你得靠在湖上划舟谋生，那我会伤心的。”“我是个傻瓜，没感觉吗？你拒绝了一个更有钱的人而嫁给我，现在我有权给你东西，可我想给你的东西你一半都不要，我怎么能那么想呢？姑娘们每天都那样想，可怜的人们，她们受到告诫，认为那是她们的唯一出路。你受到的教育较好，尽管我一度曾为你担心。我没有失望，因为女儿信守了妈妈的教诲。昨天我跟妈妈这样说了，她看上去又高兴又感激，好像我给了她一张百万元支票，让她用来行善。劳伦斯太太，你没有在听我的道德评论？”劳里住了口，因为艾美眼睛虽然盯着他的脸，表情却心不在焉。\\n\\n “不，我听着呢，同时我在欣赏着你下巴上的笑靥。我不想使你虚有其表，可是我得承认，较之丈夫所有的钱，我更为他的英俊自豪。别笑，你的鼻子对我是那么大的安慰。”艾美带着艺术的满足感轻柔地抚摸着那个轮廓优美的鼻子。\\n\\n 劳里一生受到过许多赞美，但没有比这更合他心意的。虽然他笑话着妻子这种特别的趣味，但他还是明白地表示出他的高兴。艾美慢慢说道：“我可以问你个问题吗，亲爱的？”“当然可以。”“假如乔真的嫁给了巴尔先生，你会在乎吗？“噢，那是烦恼所在，是不？我就知道那笑靥里有什么东西不合你的意。我不是个占着马槽的狗，我是世界上最幸福的人。我向你保证，在乔的婚礼上，我会带着和脚跟一样轻快的心情跳舞。你怀疑这点，宝贝？”\\n\\n 艾美抬头看着他，满意了。她最后的一点忌妒与担心永远消失了。她感谢了他，神情充满爱与自信。\\n\\n “但愿我们能为那个好人老教授做点什么。我们能不能编造出个富亲戚，他乐于助人，死在了德国，留给他一大笔遗产？”劳里说。这时他们手挽手，开始顺着长客厅来回踱步。\\n\\n 他们喜欢这样，来纪念城堡花园。\\n\\n “乔会查明真相，毁了一切的，就像教授现在这样，乔为他非常自豪。昨天她还说，她认为贫穷是件美好的事。”“上帝保佑她！要是她有个学者丈夫，还有五六个小男女教授要养活，她就不会这样想了。现在我们别去干涉，等待机会吧。到时我们为她们做点好事，那由不得他们了。我受到的教育一部分得归功于乔。她相信人们应该诚实地偿还债务，所以我将用那种方法说服她。”“能够帮助别人多么令人愉快，是不是？有力量慷慨施舍那一直是我的一个梦想。感谢你，我的梦想实现了。”“哦，我们尽可能地多做善事，好不好？有一种穷人我特别愿意帮助。十足的乞丐得到了照顾，可是，有身份的穷人日子过得很差，因为他们不求人，人们也不敢贸然提供捐助。\\n\\n 然而还是有上千种办法帮助他们，只要人们知道怎样巧妙地去做，而不致冒犯他们。我得说，我宁愿为一个破落的绅士效劳，也不愿去帮一个巧言哄骗的叫花子。我想这样不对。但我就是这样做，虽然它更难做。”“因为只有一个绅士才能做到这一点，”爱家协会的另一名成员补充道。\\n\\n “谢谢，恐怕我不配受到那么好的赞美。但是，我正打算说，我在国外闲荡时，看到许多有天赋的年轻人为了实现他们的梦想做着各种牺牲，忍受着真正的艰难困苦。他们中的一些人非常杰出。他们像勇士般地工作，他们贫穷，无朋无友，却充满勇气、耐心、意志。我为自己惭愧，很想给予他们适当的救助。我乐于帮助这些人。因为，假如他们有天才，则得以为他们效劳，不让天才由于缺乏足够的燃料而埋没或者耽搁，这是个能获得美誉的善举。假如他们没有天才，也能够安慰这些可怜的人，在他们发现自己并非天才时而免于绝望，总归是件好事。”“的确是这样。还有一种人不愿求助，甘心默默受苦。我知道点情况，因为是你把我变成了公主，就像古老故事里国王对婢女所做的那样。在这之前，我也属于那一种人。劳里，有抱负的姑娘们生活得不易。她们常常看着青春、健康以及宝贵的机会过去，只是因为缺少适时的小小帮助。人们一直对我非常好。只要我看到姑娘们像我以前那样奋力挣扎前进，我就想伸手帮助他们，就像我得到帮助一样。”“你就这样做吧，你这样像个天使！”劳里叫道。他脸上洋溢着干慈善事业的热情，决心专门为有艺术倾向的女人们设立一个机构，并捐赠基金。”富人们无权坐在那里独自享乐，或者积累钱财让别人浪费。死后留下遗产，不如活着时明智地花钱，享受使同胞幸福的乐趣，这样更为聪明。我们将过得非常幸福。而且，慷慨地施舍于人，会额外增加我们的快乐。你愿意做一个小多加，四外走动，倒空大篮子里的安慰，再装满善行吗？”“要是你愿做勇敢的圣马丁，英勇地穿行于人世间，驻步让乞丐们合穿你的外套的话，我真心地愿意。”“就这么决定了，我们将尽量做好。”于是一对新人为着心灵的交合紧紧握手，然后又幸福地继续踱起步来。他们感到他们温馨的小家更加亲切，因为，他们希望能使别的家庭快乐。他们相信，要是他们为别人踏平了岐岖之路，他们自己走在繁花似锦的小路上，双脚会走得更直；他们感到，爱心能使他们温柔地记起不如他们幸运的人们，这种爱心使他俩的心贴得更紧了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/91/7771.html","bookId":476,"book":{"id":476,"title":"Little Women小妇人","description":"简介： 这部小说带有自传性质，生动地描写了一个美国家庭马奇家四姐妹的成长过程。南北战争时父亲常年随军在外，她们伴着慈爱的母亲生活在小城镇。四姐妹的性格是既有共性又有个性的。共性是她们都生活于一个和谐的家庭，父母慈爱，子女孝顺，伦理观念强，相爱互助，自强自立，...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289439652f14e4.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/91","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
