{"id":36034,"no":43,"title":"Chapter 43 Surprises","content":"Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the fire, and thinking. It was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk. No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth\u0027s little red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. Her face looked tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she was thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and how little she seemed to have accomplished. Almost twenty-five, and nothing to show for it. Jo was mistaken in that. There was a good deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.\n \"An old maid, that\u0027s what I\u0027m to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I\u0027m old and can\u0027t enjoy it, solitary, and can\u0027t share it, independent, and don\u0027t need it. Well, I needn\u0027t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say, old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but . . .\" and there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.\n It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to five-and-twenty. But it\u0027s not as bad as it looks, and one can get on quite happily if one has something in one\u0027s self to fall back upon. At twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly resolve that they never will be. At thirty they say nothing about it, but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully. Don\u0027t laugh at the spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns, and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make the faded faces beautiful in God\u0027s sight. Even the sad, sour sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part of life, if for no other reason. And looking at them with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time. That rosy cheeks don\u0027t last forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now.\n Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble, and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for \u0027the best nevvy in the world\u0027.\n Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this little homily), for suddenly Laurie\u0027s ghost seemed to stand before her, a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn\u0027t like to show it. But, like Jenny in the ballad . . .\n She could not think it he\n and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and kissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully . . .\n \"Oh my Teddy! Oh my Teddy!\"\n \"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?\"\n \"Glad! My blessed boy, words can\u0027t express my gladness. Where\u0027s Amy?\"\n \"Your mother has got her down at Meg\u0027s. We stopped there by the way, and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.\"\n \"Your what?\" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.\n \"Oh, the dickens! Now I\u0027ve done it,\" and he looked so guilty that Jo was down on him like a flash.\n \"You\u0027ve gone and got married!\"\n \"Yes, please, but I never will again,\" and he went down upon his knees, with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth, and triumph.\n \"Actually married?\"\n \"Very much so, thank you.\"\n \"Mercy on us. What dreadful thing will you do next?\" and Jo fell into her seat with a gasp.\n \"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,\" returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with satisfaction.\n \"What can you expect, when you take one\u0027s breath away, creeping in like a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.\"\n \"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to barricade.\"\n Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, \"The old pillow is up garret, and we don\u0027t need it now. So, come and \u0027fess, Teddy.\"\n \"How good it sounds to hear you say \u0027Teddy\u0027! No one ever calls me that but you,\" and Laurie sat down with an air of great content.\n \"What does Amy call you?\"\n \"My lord.\"\n \"That\u0027s like her. Well, you look it,\" and Jo\u0027s eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever.\n The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it, and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them. It was gone directly however, for Laurie said, with a vain attempt at dignity . . .\n \"Don\u0027t I look like a married man and the head of a family?\"\n \"Not a bit, and you never will. You\u0027ve grown bigger and bonnier, but you are the same scapegrace as ever.\"\n \"Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,\" began Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.\n \"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so irresistibly funny that I can\u0027t keep sober!\" answered Jo, smiling all over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.\n \"It\u0027s no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all coming up presently. I couldn\u0027t wait. I wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise, and have \u0027first skim\u0027 as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream.\"\n \"Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end. Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I\u0027m pining to know.\"\n \"Well, I did it to please Amy,\" began Laurie, with a twinkle that made Jo exclaim . . .\n \"Fib number one. Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell the truth, if you can, sir.\"\n \"Now she\u0027s beginning to marm it. Isn\u0027t it jolly to hear her?\" said Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed. \"It\u0027s all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But Grandpa wanted to come home. He went to please me, and I couldn\u0027t let him go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn\u0027t let Amy come with us. So I just settled the difficulty by saying, \u0027Let\u0027s be married, and then we can do as we like\u0027.\"\n \"Of course you did. You always have things to suit you.\"\n \"Not always,\" and something in Laurie\u0027s voice made Jo say hastily . . .\n \"How did you ever get Aunt to agree?\"\n \"It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps of good reasons on our side. There wasn\u0027t time to write and ask leave, but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only \u0027taking time by the fetlock\u0027, as my wife says.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t we proud of those two words, and don\u0027t we like to say them?\" interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.\n \"A trifle, perhaps, she\u0027s such a captivating little woman I can\u0027t help being proud of her. Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play propriety. We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round, so we did it.\"\n \"When, where, how?\" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.\n \"Six weeks ago, at the American consul\u0027s, in Paris, a very quiet wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn\u0027t forget dear little Beth.\"\n Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow, which he remembered well.\n \"Why didn\u0027t you let us know afterward?\" asked Jo, in a quieter tone, when they had sat quite still a minute.\n \"We wanted to surprise you. We thought we were coming directly home, at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found he couldn\u0027t be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but once in their lives. My faith! Wasn\u0027t it love among the roses!\"\n Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before . . .\n \"Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we\u0027ll put it by forever. As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is altered, and I have learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places in my heart, that\u0027s all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I never could be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that I didn\u0027t know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love you both alike. But I couldn\u0027t, and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another?\"\n \"I\u0027ll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy and girl again. The happy old times can\u0027t come back, and we mustn\u0027t expect it. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking. I\u0027m sure you feel this. I see the change in you, and you\u0027ll find it in me. I shall miss my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be what I hoped he would. We can\u0027t be little playmates any longer, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives, won\u0027t we, Laurie?\"\n He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn\u0027t want the coming home to be a sad one, \"I can\u0027t make it true that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning Amy\u0027s pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me, how time does fly!\"\n \"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn\u0027t talk so like a grandma. I flatter myself I\u0027m a \u0027gentleman growed\u0027 as Peggotty said of David, and when you see Amy, you\u0027ll find her rather a precocious infant,\" said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.\n \"You may be a little older in years, but I\u0027m ever so much older in feeling, Teddy. Women always are, and this last year has been such a hard one that I feel forty.\"\n \"Poor Jo! We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You are older. Here\u0027s a line, and there\u0027s another. Unless you smile, your eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear on it. You\u0027ve had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone. What a selfish beast I\u0027ve been!\" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a remorseful look.\n But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful, \"No, I had Father and Mother to help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear. I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it\u0027s good for me, and . . .\"\n \"You never shall be again,\" broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her, as if to fence out every human ill. \"Amy and I can\u0027t get on without you, so you must come and teach \u0027the children\u0027 to keep house, and go halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and all be blissfully happy and friendly together.\"\n \"If I shouldn\u0027t be in the way, it would be very pleasant. I begin to feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came. You always were a comfort, Teddy,\" and Jo leaned her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill and Laurie told her to hold on to him.\n He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming.\n \"You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and laughing the next. You look a little wicked now. What is it, Grandma?\"\n \"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.\"\n \"Like angels!\"\n \"Yes, of course, but which rules?\"\n \"I don\u0027t mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her think so, it pleases her, you know. By-and-by we shall take turns, for marriage, they say, halves one\u0027s rights and doubles one\u0027s duties.\"\n \"You\u0027ll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your life.\"\n \"Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don\u0027t think I shall mind much. She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well. In fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while.\"\n \"That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it!\" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.\n It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his \"high and mighty\" air, \"Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of man to submit to it. My wife and I respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.\"\n Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her pleasure.\n \"I am sure of that. Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man best, you remember.\"\n \"She can blow him up as well as shine on him,\" laughed Laurie. \"such a lecture as I got at Nice! I give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your scoldings, a regular rouser. I\u0027ll tell you all about it sometime, she never will, because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the good-for-nothing.\"\n \"What baseness! Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I\u0027ll defend you.\"\n \"I look as if I needed it, don\u0027t I?\" said Laurie, getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous, as Amy\u0027s voice was heard calling, \"Where is she? Where\u0027s my dear old Jo?\"\n In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over. Mr. Laurence, hale and hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever. It was good to see him beam at \u0027my children\u0027, as he called the young pair. It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart, and best of all, to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made.\n The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own dress hadn\u0027t a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Mofffat would be entirely eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that \u0027her ladyship\u0027 was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman. Jo thought, as she watched the pair, \"How well they look together! I was right, and Laurie has found the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.\" Mrs. March and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.\n For Amy\u0027s face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool, prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become.\n \"Love has done much for our little girl,\" said her mother softly.\n \"She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,\" Mr. March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him.\n Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her \u0027pitty aunty\u0027, but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of delightful charms. Demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew where to have him.\n \"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face. Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,\" and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul.\n \"Blest if she ain\u0027t in silk from head to foot; ain\u0027t it a relishin\u0027 sight to see her settin\u0027 there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks calling little Amy \u0027Mis. Laurence!\u0027\" muttered old Hannah, who could not resist frequent \"peeks\" through the slide as she set the table in a most decidedly promiscuous manner.\n Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all burst out together--trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and provide refreshment--for they would have been hoarse and faint if they had gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence. Mrs. March as proudly leaned on the arm of \u0027my son\u0027. The old gentleman took Jo, with a whispered, \"You must be my girl now,\" and a glance at the empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, \"I\u0027ll try to fill her place, sir.\"\n The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity. Didn\u0027t they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn\u0027t they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets, there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo\u0027s sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little sinners attached themselves to \u0027Dranpa\u0027, who hadn\u0027t his spectacles on. Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on Father Laurence\u0027s arm. The others paired off as before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless. She did not mind it at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah\u0027s eager inquiry.\n \"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver dishes that\u0027s stored away over yander?\"\n \"Shouldn\u0027t wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and wore diamonds and point lace every day. Teddy thinks nothing too good for her,\" returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.\n \"No more there is! Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?\" asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above, and as Demi\u0027s short plaid legs toiled up the last stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon, for even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to herself, \"I\u0027ll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won\u0027t do to be dismal now.\" Then she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was, and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door.\n She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.\n \"Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!\" cried Jo, with a clutch, as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in.\n \"And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,\" and the Professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them.\n \"No, we haven\u0027t, only the family. My sister and friends have just come home, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us.\"\n Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously away, and come again another day, but how could he, when Jo shut the door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him, and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.\n \"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all. You haf been ill, my friend?\"\n He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.\n \"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you last.\"\n \"Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that,\" and he shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big, warm hand.\n \"Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,\" she said, with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.\n If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone greeted him kindly, for Jo\u0027s sake at first, but very soon they liked him for his own. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once, feeling even the more friendly because he was poor. For poverty enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself at home. The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The women telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his guest\u0027s benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.\n If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie\u0027s behavior would have amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long. He got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew it, was drawn into the circle. For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere, and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. Then his eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it. But Jo had her own eyes to take care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.\n A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens. Mr. Bhaer\u0027s face had lost the absent-minded expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she watched her father\u0027s absorbed face, \"How he would enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!\" Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed, but didn\u0027t stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands.\n \"Dear old fellow! He couldn\u0027t have got himself up with more care if he\u0027d been going a-wooing,\" said Jo to herself, and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.\n The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the little blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.\n Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr. Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of matches, made a move to go.\n \"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together again once more,\" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.\n They were not all there. But no one found the words thougtless or untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence, invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the household league that love made disoluble. The little chair stood in its old place. The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew \u0027so heavy\u0027, was still on its accustomed shelf. The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved, and above it Beth\u0027s face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon them, seeming to say, \"Be happy. I am here.\"\n \"Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved,\" said Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.\n But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, \"Not tonight, dear. I can\u0027t show off tonight.\"\n But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she sang Beth\u0027s songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught, and touched the listener\u0027s hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her. The room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth\u0027s favorite hymn. It was hard to say . . .\n Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;\n and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth\u0027s kiss.\n \"Now, we must finish with Mignon\u0027s song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that,\" said Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified \"Hem!\" as he stepped into the corner where Jo stood, saying . . .\n \"You will sing with me? We go excellently well together.\"\n A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a grasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune. It didn\u0027t much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.\n Know\u0027st thou the land where the citron blooms,\n used to be the Professor\u0027s favorite line, for \u0027das land\u0027 meant Germany to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody, upon the words . . .\n There, oh there, might I with thee, O, my beloved, go\n and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked.\n The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she had been introduced simply as \u0027my sister\u0027, and no one had called her by her new name since he came. He forgot himself still further when Laurie said, in his most gracious manner, at parting . . .\n \"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.\"\n Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\n \"I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here some days.\"\n He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother\u0027s voice gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter\u0027s eyes, for Mrs. March was not so blind to her children\u0027s interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.\n \"I suspect that is a wise man,\" remarked Mr. March, with placid satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone.\n \"I know he is a good one,\" added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as she wound up the clock.\n \"I thought you\u0027d like him,\" was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her bed.\n She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city, and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor, somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture in the dark.\n \n 薄暮时分，乔独自躺在那张旧沙发上。她看着炉火，脑中思索着。她最喜欢这样打发黄昏时光。没有人打扰她。她总是躺在那儿，枕着贝思的小红枕头，策划着故事，做着梦，充满柔情地想着妹妹，妹妹似乎根本没有远离她。乔的神情疲惫、严肃、有点悲哀。明天是她的生日。她在想，时光过得多快啊，她就要一天天老起来了，她的成就似乎太少。马上就二十五岁，却没什么可以炫耀的。乔想错了，她有许多可以炫耀的东西，不久以后，他便发现了它们，并为之感到快意。\n “我就要成为老姑娘了，一个喜欢文学的老处女、以笔为配偶，一组故事当孩子，也许二十年之后会有点儿名气。像可怜的约翰逊那样，我老了时，不能享受名气之乐了，便会感到孤独。没人与我分享快乐，我自食其力，也不需要名气了。哎呀，我不必去做一个愁眉不展的圣徒，或者一个只顾自己的罪人。我敢说，老姑娘们只要习惯了独身生活，会过得很舒服的。可是- \"想到这，乔叹了口气，仿佛这种前景并不诱人。\n 首先，这前景是难以诱人。对二十五岁的人来说，到了三十岁便万事休矣。然而，事情并不像看上去那样糟。如果一个女人有了归依，她便能过得相当幸福。到了二十五岁，姑娘们便开始谈起要成为老姑娘了，但却暗下决心，决不这样。\n 上了三十岁，她们不再提及此事，而是默默地接受事实。聪明的姑娘们会想到，她们还有二十多年有益的幸福时光，可以学着优雅地打发人生，聊以自慰。亲爱的姑娘们，别笑话那些老处女们。因为，在那素净的长袍下静静跳动着的心窝里，往往隐藏着非常温柔的爱情悲剧。为青春、健康、抱负以及爱情本身默默作出的牺牲，使褪色的容颜在上帝的面前变得美丽了。即便是悲哀、阴郁的老姑娘们，也应亲切地对待她们。因为，她们就是为了这才错过了人生最甜美的部分。\n 妙龄姑娘们应该怀着同情看待她们，不应看不起她们。应该记住，她们也可能会辜负大好时光，红润的面颊不会永远保持，银丝会掺进漂亮的棕发，不久以后，善良与尊敬会和现在的爱情与赞美同样甜蜜。\n 先生们，也就是男孩子们，对老姑娘们表示殷勤吧，别管她们多穷、多普通、多古板。因为，唯一值得拥有的骑士精神便是乐意向老人表示敬意，保护弱者，为妇女们服务。别考虑她们的身份、年龄及肤色，回想一下那些善良的婶子们吧，她们不仅教训过你们，数落过你们，而且也照顾、宠爱过你们，但并不常常得到你们的感谢。她们帮你们摆脱困境，从她们不多的储蓄中给你们零用钱，她们用衰老的手指耐心地为你们缝制衣服。想想她们心甘情愿为你们做的事吧。你们应该满怀感激地给那些可亲的老太太们小小的关注，妇女们只要一息尚存，就会乐于接受它们的。眼睛明亮的姑娘很快就会看出你们的这种品格，并会因之更喜欢你们。唯一能分开母与子的力量便是死亡，假如死亡夺去了你们的母亲，你们肯定会在某个普丽西拉婶子那里得到亲切的欢迎和母亲般的爱抚。在她孤寂的衰老心坎里，为她\"世上最好的侄子\"保留着最温暖的一角。\n 乔肯定睡着了（我敢说，在这小小的布道期间，我的读者们也睡着了），因为劳里的幻影仿佛突然站在她面前 -一个实在逼真的幻影 俯身看着她，带着以前他感触良多而又不想显露出来时常有的表情。可是，就像歌谣里的珍妮--她想不到竟会是他。\n 乔躺在那儿，惊讶地默默盯着他看，直到劳里俯身吻她，这才认出他。她一跃而起，高兴地叫着- “哦，特迪！哦，我的特迪！”“亲爱的乔，你见到我高兴了，对吗？”“高兴！我幸运的男孩，言语表达不了我的欢喜，艾美呢？”“你妈妈把她留在了梅格家。我们顺道在那儿停留了一下，我没法子将我的妻子从她们手中救出来。”“你的什么？”乔叫了起来，劳里不知不觉带着洋洋自得的口气说出了这两个字，泄露了秘密。\n “哎呀，糟了！我已经这样做了。”他看上去那样内疚，乔即刻和他过不去了。\n “你走了，然后结了婚！”\n “是的，请原谅。可是我决不会再结了。”他跪了下来，悔过似地握着手，脸上的表情充满淘气、欢乐与胜利。\n “真的结了婚？”\n “千真万确，谢谢。”\n “我的天哪！接下来你要做什么可怕的事呢？”乔喘着气跌坐回她的位子。\n “你的祝贺不一般，就是不大客气，”劳里回答。他一副可怜兮兮的样子，但却又满足地满脸堆笑。\n “你像个盗贼似地溜进来，又这样子泄露出秘密，让人大吃一惊。你能期待什么呢？起来，你这傻孩子，把事情都告诉我。”“一个字也不告诉你，除非你让我坐到老地方，并且保证不再跟我过不去，用枕头设障碍。”\n 听到这话乔笑了起来，她已很长时间没笑了。她逗弄地拍着沙发，友好地说：“那旧枕头放到阁楼上去了，现在我们不需要它了，过来坦白交待吧，特迪。”“听你叫\u0027特迪\u0027多么悦耳！除了你还没有谁那样叫我呢。”劳里带着非常满足的神气坐了下来。\n “艾美叫你什么？”\n “夫君。”\n “这像她说的话，嗯，你看着也像。”乔的眼神分明表示：她发现她的男孩比以前更清秀了。\n 枕头没了，然而还是有着障碍 -一个自然的障碍，是由时间、分离、变化了的心所造成的。两个都感到了这一点，有一会儿他们对望着，仿佛这个无形的障碍在他们身上投下了一道小小的阴影。然而，阴影很快便消失了，因为劳里徒劳地试图端着架子说话 “我看着像不像个结了婚的人和一家之主？”“一点也不像，你也决不会像的。你长大些了，也更漂亮了，可是你还是以前的那个淘气鬼。”“哎唷，真的，乔，你应该对我尊重些了，”劳里开口说，他对这一切很欣赏。\n “我一想到你结了婚，安定了，就忍不住觉得那么好笑。\n 我无法保持严肃。这样我怎能尊重你？”乔回答。她满面笑容，极具感染力，结果两人又笑了起来。然后他们坐好，完全以从前那种愉快的方式细细谈了起来。\n “你没有必要冒着严寒去接艾美。一会儿他们都会过来的。我等不及了，我想第一个告诉你这个令人惊喜的大事。我想得到那\u0027第一瓶奶油\u0027，就像我们从前争要奶油时说的那样。”“你当然得到了，可是故事开错了头，给弄毁了。好了，开始说吧，全都告诉我，我太想知道了。”“嗯，我那样做是想讨艾美的欢心，”劳里眨着眼开了口，这使乔叫了起来“一号小谎言。是艾美想讨你的欢心。接着说，可以的话，讲实话，先生。”“哎唷，她开始用太太的口气问话了。听她说话是不是令人开心？”劳里对着炉火自问道。炉火发着光，闪着亮，似乎十分赞同他。“这是一回事，要知道，她和我已结成了一体。\n 一个多月以前，我们打算和卡罗尔一家一道回来，可是他们突然改变了主意，决定在巴黎再过一个冬天。爷爷想回家了，他到那儿去是为了让我高兴，我不能让他独自走，又丢不下艾美。卡罗尔太太脑子里有些英国人的观点，什么女监护人之类的荒唐念头，她不放艾美和我们同行。于是，我便说：\u0027我们结婚吧，这样就能随心所欲了。\u0027就这样解决了那个难题。”“你当然会那么做的，你总是事事如意。”“并不总是那样。”劳里声音里有种东西，使乔赶快接话 \"你们怎么得到婶婶同意的？”“那可不容易。不过，别讲出去，我们说服了她。我们这一边有许许多多的理由。没有时间写信回家请求允许了，可是你们大家都高兴这样，很快都会同意的，像我妻子说的那样，这只是\u0027抓住时间马儿的腿\u0027。”“我们真为那两个字骄傲，难道我们不喜欢说那两个字吗？”乔打断了她。这次是她对着炉火说话了。她高兴地注视着炉火，仿佛它在那双眼里燃起了幸福的火花，而她上一次看着它们却那么悲哀忧郁。\n “也许那是桩小事。艾美是那样一个迷人的小妇人，我无法不为她骄傲。嗯，当时叔叔和婶婶在那儿当监护人，我们俩相互那么依恋着对方，分开了便什么也干不了。那个不坏的主意使一切问题迎刃而解，所以我们便结了婚。”“什么时候？在哪里？怎样结的？”乔问道，她的问话充满了女人的强烈兴趣与好奇心，自己却一点儿也没意识到。\n “六个星期前，在巴黎的美国领事馆，当然，婚礼非常安静，即便在我们的幸福时刻，我们也没忘记亲爱的小贝思。”他说到这里，乔把手伸给地握祝劳里轻轻地抚摸着那个他记得很清楚的小红枕头。\n “我们本来想让你们大吃一惊的，开始，我们以为会直接回家的，可是我们一结完婚，我那可亲的老先生发现至少在一个月之内不能做好动身准备，所以打发我们随意去哪儿度蜜月。艾美曾把玫瑰谷叫做公认的蜜月之家，于是，我们便去了那儿，我们过得非常幸福，这种幸福人生只有这一次，千真万确，那真是玫瑰花下的爱情啊！”劳里有一会儿似乎忘掉了乔，乔感到高兴，因为他这样无拘无束，自然而然地对她讲述这些，使她确信他已完全原谅了她，忘却了以前的爱。她试图抽出手来，但是他好像猜到了，促使他作出几乎没意识到的冲动念头，紧紧地握住了她的手，他带着她不曾见过的男子汉的严肃神情说道- “乔，亲爱的，我想说件事，然后我们就把它永远丢开吧，当我写信说艾美一直对我很好时，我在那封信中说，我决不会停止对你的爱，这话是真的，但是那种爱已变了，我明白了这样更好。艾美和你在我心中变换了位置，就这么回事。我想，事情本来就是这样安排的。假如我按照你的意图去等待，这件事会自然地发生。可是我根本耐不下性子，所以弄得头疼。那时我是个孩子，任性狂暴，好不容易才认识到错误。乔，正如你说的，那确是个错误。我当了回傻瓜，才明白这一点。\n 我发誓，有一段时间我脑子里混乱不堪，搞不清楚我更爱谁，你还是艾美，我试图两人都爱，但做不到。当我在瑞士见到艾美时，一切似乎立刻明朗了。你们俩都站到了适当的位置上。我确信旧的爱完全消失了，才开始了新的爱，因此我能够坦率地与作为妹妹的乔及作为妻子的艾美交心，深深地爱着两人。你愿意相信吗？愿意回到我们初识时那段幸福的时光吗？”“我愿意相信，全心全意相信。但是，特迪，我们再也不是男孩女孩了。愉快的老时光不可能回来了，我们不能这样企盼。现在我们是男人和女人，有正经的事情要做。游戏时期已经结束，我们必须停止嬉闹了，我相信你也感到了这一点。我在你身上看到了变化，你也会在我身上看到变化。我会怀念我的男孩，但是我会同样爱那个男人，更加赞赏他，因为他打算做我希望他做的事。我们不可能再当小玩伴了，但是我们会成为兄弟姐妹，我们一生都会互爱互助，是不是这样，劳里？”他什么也没说，却握住了她递过来的手，将他的脸贴在上面放了一会儿。他感到，从他那男孩气热情的坟墓中，升腾起一种美丽的牢不可破的友情，使两人都感到幸福。乔不愿使他们的归来蒙上哀愁，所以过了一会，她便愉快地说：“我还是不能确信，你们两个孩子真的结了婚，要开始持家过日子了。哎呀，好像还是昨天的事，我替艾美扣围裙扣子，你开玩笑时我拽你的头发。天哪，时间过得真快！”“两个孩子中有一个比你大，所以你不必像奶奶那样说话，我自以为我已经是个\u0027长成了的先生\u0027，像佩格蒂说戴维那样。你看到艾美时，你会发现她是个相当早熟的孩子，”劳里说，他看着她母性的神气感到好笑。\n “你可能岁数比我大一点，可是我的心情比你老得多，特迪，女人们总是这样。而且这一年过得那样艰难，我感到我有四十岁了。”“可怜的乔！我们丢下你让你独自承受了这一切，而我们却在享乐。你是老了些。这里有条皱纹，那里还有一条。除了笑时，你的眼神透着悲哀。刚才我摸过枕头时，发现上面有滴泪珠。你承受了许多痛苦，而且不得不独自忍受。我是个多么自私的家伙啊！”劳里带着自责的神色拽着自己的头发。\n 然而，乔把那出卖秘密的枕头转了过去，尽力以一种十分轻松愉快的语调回答道：“不，我有爸爸妈妈帮我，有可爱的孩子安慰我，我还想到你和艾美安全、幸福，这些都使我这里的烦恼容易忍受些了。有的时候我是感到孤独，可是，我敢说那对我有好处，而且-”“你再也不会孤独了，”劳里插了嘴。他用胳膊围住她，仿佛要为她挡住人生所有的艰难困苦。“我和艾美不能没有你。\n 所以你必须来教\u0027孩子们\u0027管家，就像我们以前那样，凡事均对半分。让我们爱抚你，让我们大家在一起快快乐乐，友好相处。”“假如我不碍事的话，我当然十分乐意。我又开始感到变年轻了，你一来我所有的烦恼似乎都飞走了，你总是让人感到安慰，特迪。”乔将头靠到了劳里的肩上，就像几年前贝思生病躺在那里，劳里让她靠着那样。\n 他向下看着她，想知道她是否还记得那个时候。但是乔在暗笑着，仿佛他的到来真的使她的所有烦恼都消失了。\n “你还是那个乔，一分钟以前掉泪，转眼又笑了。现在你看着有点淘气，想什么呢，奶奶？”“我在想你和艾美在一起怎样过。”“过得像天使！”“那当然。开始是这样，可是谁统治呢？”“我不在乎告诉你现在是她统治，至少我让她这么认为 -这使她高兴，你知道。将来我们会轮流的。因为人们说，婚姻中均分权力会使责任加倍。”“你会像开始那样继续下去，艾美会统治你一生。”“嗯，她做得那样让人毫无察觉，我想我不会太在乎的。\n 她是那种知道如何统治好男人的妇人。事实上，我倒挺喜欢那样。她就像绕一卷丝绸一般，轻柔潇洒地将你绕在手指上，却使你感到好像她始终在为你效劳。“那我将会活着看到你成为怕老婆的丈夫，并为此高兴！”乔举起双手叫道。\n 劳里表现得不错，他挺起肩膀，带着男子汉的蔑视神情对那攻击一笑置之。他神气活现地回答：“艾美有教养，不会那样做的，我也不是那种屈从的人，我妻子和我互相非常尊重，不会横强霸道，也不会争吵的。”“那我相信。我和艾美从来不像我们俩那样争吵。她是那寓言故事里的太阳，我是风。记得吗？太阳对付男人最灵。”“她既能对他刮风，也能照耀他。”劳里笑了。”我在尼斯受她那样的训话！我得保证那比你任何一次责骂都厉害得多--一个真正的刺激，等什么时候我来告诉你--她决不会告诉你的，因为她告诉我，说她看不起我，为我感到羞愧，而刚说完，她便爱上了那可鄙的一方，嫁给了那个一无是处的家伙。”“那么恶劣！好吧，假如她再欺负你，到我这儿，我来卫护你。”“看上去我需要卫护，是不是？“劳里站起来摆出架子，可这时突然听到了艾美的声音，他的威严神态马上转为狂喜。艾美叫着：“她在哪？我亲爱的乔呢？”全家人成群结队进屋来了，每个人又重被拥抱亲吻。几次无效的努力后，三个旅游者不得不安坐下来，让大家看着，为他们高兴。劳伦斯先生还像以前一样老当益壮，和其他人一样，国外旅游使他变得更精神了，因为他的执拗劲好像几乎没了。他那老式的殷勤得到了改善，他比以前更慈祥了。他称一对新人为\"我的孩子们\"。看到他对他们微笑真是让人怡悦。更令人怡悦的是艾美对他尽着女儿般的责任与孝道，这完全赢得了他的心。最好的是看着劳里围着他们两个转，仿佛欣赏不够他俩组成的美景。\n 梅格的眼光一落到艾美身上，便意识到她自己的服装没有巴黎人的风味。小劳伦斯太太会使小莫法特太太黯然失色。\n 那位\"女士\"是个地地道道、非常优雅有风度的妇人。乔观察着这一对人想着：“他们俩在一起看着多么般配啊！我是对的，劳里找到了美丽、出色的女孩，她比笨拙苍老的乔更适合他的家庭，她会成为他的骄傲，而不会折磨他。”马奇太太和她丈夫面露喜色，他们点头微笑着。他们看到最小的孩子不仅做事干练，待人处世知情达理，而且也得到了爱情、自信、幸福这些更好的财富。\n 艾美的表情柔和清亮，显示出内心的宁静。她的声音里具有一种新的柔情，沉着冷静的处事之风一变而为文雅端庄、亲切动人。小小的矫饰无损于她的风度，她热诚美好的举止比她以前的优雅与新婚所焕出的魅力更为迷人，因为它明白无误地立刻使她带上了一个真正的女士标记，以前她曾希望成为这样的女士。\n “爱情使我们的小姑娘变了许多，”妈妈和蔼地说。\n “她一生都有个好榜样，亲爱的，”马奇先生低声回答，他深情地看了一眼身旁那张憔悴的脸和灰白的头。\n 黛西的眼睛离不开她的\"漂良\"（漂亮）阿姨，于是就像叭儿狗似地把自己系在了女主人的腰带上，那里充满了难以抗拒的诱惑。德米先是无动于衷，怔怔地考虑这新出现的关系，后来便性急地接受了贿赂，妥协了。诱人的贿赂是从伯恩带来的一组木熊玩具。然而，一阵侧面攻击迫使他无条件地就范了，因为劳里知道怎样对付他。\n “小伙子，我第一次有幸认识你时，你就打我的脸。现在我要求绅士般的决斗。“说着，这个高个子叔叔便开始将小侄子往上抛着，揉着，那动作既破坏了他镇定自若的尊严，也使男孩子内心喜悦。\n “哎呀，她从头到脚穿着丝绸，你看她坐在那儿神采洋洋（飞扬），听大家叫小艾美劳伦斯夫人，这真叫人心里喜欢，”老罕娜嬷嬷咕哝着。她一边明显地在胡乱摆着桌子，一边不由地频频透过拉门朝里张望。\n 天哪，那是怎样的谈话啊！先是一人说，再换另一人说，然后大家一起说起来，都想在半小时内把三年的事讲完。幸好茶点准备好了，为大家提供了暂歇机会，也提供了吃的东西。他们再像那样谈下去，会嗓子沙哑，头昏眼花的。非常幸福的一队人马鱼贯进入了小餐厅。马奇先生自豪地护送着\"劳伦斯太太\"，马奇太太则骄傲地依在\"我儿子\"的臂上，老先生拉着乔的手，瞥了一眼炉火边那个空角落，对她耳语道：“现在你得当我的女孩了。”乔双唇颤抖着低声回答：“我会试着填补她的位置，先生。”那双胞胎在后面欢跃着，他们感到太平盛世就在眼前，因为大家都为新人忙着，丢下他俩任意胡作非为。可以确信他们充分利用了这个机会。他们偷偷呷了几口茶，随意吃着姜饼，每人拿了一个热松饼，他们最妄为的违禁事便是每人往小口袋里装了一个诱人的果酱馅饼，结果馅饼给弄得粘乎乎的，成了碎屑，这教育了他们，馅饼和人性一样脆弱。他们兜里藏着馅饼，心中惴惴不安，担心乔乔阿姨锐利的眼睛会穿透那薄薄的麻纱布衣和美丽奴绒线衣，那下面隐藏着他们的赃物。所以，小罪犯们紧贴着没戴眼镜的\"爷衣\"（爷爷）。\n 艾美刚才像茶点似地被大伙传来传去，这时靠着劳伦斯爷爷的肩臂，回到客厅，其余的人像方才进去一样两两出来了。这样一来只剩下乔没了伴儿。当时她没在意，因为她滞留在餐厅，回答着罕娜急切的询问。\n “艾美小姐坐那四轱轳马车（双座四轮马车）吗？她用储藏的银盘子吃饭吗？“要是她驾着六匹白马，每天用金盘子吃饭，戴钻石戒指，穿针绣花边衣，我也不奇怪。特迪认为怎样待她都不过分，”乔心满意足地回答。\n “没问题了！你早饭要什么？杂烩还是鱼丸子？”罕娜问。\n 她聪明地将无味的话题混进了带有诗意的事里。\n “我随便。”乔关上了门，她感到此时食物不是个合适的话题。她站了一会儿，看着在楼上消失的那一帮人，当德米穿着格子呢裤的短腿艰难地爬上最后一个楼梯时，一阵突如起来的孤独感袭上了她的心头。感觉那样强烈，她眼睛模糊了。她环顾四周，仿佛想找到什么可以依靠的，因为，即便是特迪也丢弃了她。她自言自语：“我等到上床时再哭，现在不能让人看出情绪消沉。”要是她知道什么样的生日礼物正分分秒秒向她逼近，她就不会这么说了。接着她的手伸向眼睛 -因为她的男孩式习惯之一便是从来不知她的手绢在哪--她刚勉强挤出笑容，就听到门廊有人敲门。\n 她好客地匆匆打开门，盯住了来人，仿佛又来了个幻影使她吃惊。那里站着个留着小胡子的高个子先生，像是午夜的阳光，在黑暗中朝她微笑着。\n “噢，巴尔先生，看到你我是多么高兴！”乔一把抓住他叫了起来，仿佛生怕还没将他弄进来，黑暗就把他吞没。\n “见到马奇小姐我也高兴— 可是，不，你们有客人- \"听到楼上传来的说话声以及咚咚的脚步声，教授停住了。\n “不，没有，只是家里人。我妹妹和朋友刚刚回家，我们都非常快乐，进来吧，加入到我们中来吧。”虽然巴尔先生善于交际，我认为他还是想有礼貌地走开，改天再来。可是，乔在他身后关上了门，拿下了他的帽子，他怎好走呢？也许她的表情起了作用，见到他，乔忘了隐瞒高兴的心情，她坦率地表露了出来，这对那孤寂的人具有异乎寻常的魅力。乔的欢迎大大超出了他最大胆的希求。\n “要是我不成为多余的先生，我将非常高兴见到他们大家。你生病了，我的朋友？”他突然问道，因为乔在挂他的大衣时，脸色暗了下来，他注意到了这个变化。\n “不是病了，而是疲倦、痛苦。离开你后我们有了灾难。”“哦，是的，我知道。我听说了，我为你感到心疼。”他又握了握她的手。他的表情那样充满同情，乔感到好像任何安慰都比不了这种仁爱的眼神和温暖大手的紧握。\n “爸，妈，这是我的朋友，巴尔教授。”她的表情与语调带有不可遏止的自豪与快乐，仿佛她方才是吹着喇叭、手舞足蹈地开了门。\n 倘使那陌生人对将受到怎样的接待心存疑虑的话，一会儿他受到的热诚欢迎使他放了心。每个人都客气地和他招呼，开始是为乔的缘故，很快他们就为他自己的缘故喜欢其他来。\n 他们情不自禁，因为他带着法宝，能打开所有的心。这些纯洁的人们立刻同情其他来，因为他穷，感到更加亲密。贫穷使生活稍好些的人们变得富有起来，贫穷也是真正热情好客精神的担保。巴尔先生坐在那里环顾四周，他的神情像是旅行者敲开了陌生人的屋门发现自己回到了家。孩子们围着他，像是蜜蜂围着蜜糖罐。两个孩子一边一个坐在他的腿上，他们以孩子的大胆搜他的口袋，拔他的胡子，检查他的表，想引其他的注意。妇女们相互传递着赞许的信息。马奇先生感到与他心性相投，便为客人打开了他的话题精疲宝库。寡言的约翰在旁听着，欣赏着，却不发一言。劳伦斯先生发现不可能去睡觉了。\n 要不是乔在忙着别的事，她会被劳里的表现逗乐的。一阵轻微的刺痛，不是出于忌妒，而是出于类似怀疑的东西，使得这位先生开始时带着兄长般的慎重超然地观察着新来者，但是持续不长时间，他还没反应过来，便不由自主地产生了兴趣，被吸引进那一圈人中。因为，在这样愉快的氛围里，巴尔先生充分发挥了他的口才。他侃侃而谈，妙语连珠。他极少对劳里说话，却常看他。他看着这个风华正茂的年轻人，脸上便会掠过一丝阴影，仿佛为自己失去的青春遗憾，然后他的眼睛便会渴望地转向乔。假如乔看到了他的眼神，她肯定会回答那无声的询问。可是乔得管住自己的双眼，因为不能放任它们。她小心地让眼睛盯着正在织的小短袜上，像是个模范的独身姨母。\n 乔不时地偷看一眼教授，这使她神清气爽，就像在尘土飞扬的路上散步后饮过清泉一样，因为在这悄然平视中，她看到了某种她渴望的东西。此刻，巴尔先生的脸上丝毫没有心不在焉的表情，他精神抖擞，兴致勃勃。她想，实际上是年轻漂亮。她忘了将他和劳里比较，对陌生人她通常这样做。\n 这对他们大为不利。此刻，巴尔似乎很有灵感，虽然转到了古人葬礼习俗的谈话，不能被看作是令人兴奋的话题。当特迪在一场争论中被驳得哑口无言时，乔得意得脸上放着光彩。\n 她看着爸爸神情专注的脸，心里想到：“要是他每天都有我的教授这样的谈友，该会多快乐啊！”最后一点，巴尔先生穿着一件新的黑色西服，这使他看上去比以前更像个绅士。他浓密的头发剪了，梳理得很整齐，可是保持不了太久，因为他一激动起来，便像往常一样，把它们弄得蓬乱不堪。比起平整的头发，乔更喜欢他的头发乱竖着，因为她认为那样使他漂亮的额头带上了朱庇特似的风味。可怜的乔，她是怎样赞美着那个其貌不扬的人啊！她坐在那儿，那样默默地织着袜子，同时什么也没逃脱她的眼睛，她甚至注意到巴尔先生洁净的袖口上有着金光闪闪的扣子。\n “亲爱的老兄！他即便是去求婚，也不可能比这更仔细地装扮自己了，”乔心里想着。这句话突然使她心中一动，她的脸陡然红了起来，只好将线团丢下，弯腰去拣，借机遮蔽一下红红的脸。\n 然而，这个动作并没有像她预期的那样成功，因为，用比喻的说法，教授正在为葬礼火堆添火，这时他放下了火把，躬身去捡那小蓝线团。当然，他们两人的头猛地撞到了一起，撞得眼冒金星，两个人红着脸直起身来，都没有拾到线团。他们回到了各自的坐位，心里后悔不该离座。\n 没有谁意识到夜已深了，罕娜早就高明地转移了孩子，他们打着盹，就像两朵粉红的罂栗花，劳伦斯先生回家休息了。\n 剩下的人围炉而坐，不停地谈着，完全不顾时间的流逝。后来，梅格母性的头里产生了坚定的信念：黛西肯定摔到床下去了，德米想必在研究着火柴的结构，睡衣定是被燃着了。于是她动身回家了。\n “让我们来唱歌吧，就像以前那样，因为我们又聚到一起，”乔说。她觉得只有引吭高歌才能尽情而又稳妥地宣泄心中的激情。\n 并不是所有的人都到了，可是没有谁感到乔的话缺少考虑、不真实，因为贝思似乎还在他们中间，无形而又无时不在。她比以前更可爱。爱使家庭坚不可摧，死亡也不能将起拆散。那张小椅子放在老地方，小篮子还放在惯常的架子上，篮子里装着她没完成的针线活，那张心爱的钢琴没有移动地方，现在很少有人去碰它。贝思安详的笑脸就在钢琴上方，像以前那样，俯视着他们，仿\n \n
