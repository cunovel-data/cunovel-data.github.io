{"id":36014,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 19 Amy\u0027s Will","content":"While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at Aunt March\u0027s. She felt her exile deeply, and, for the first time in her life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March never petted anyone; she did not approve of it; but she meant to be kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew\u0027s children, though she didn\u0027t think proper to confess it. She really did her best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made! Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and grey hair, can sympathize with children\u0027s little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy talks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy in hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago - a process which carried dismay to Amy\u0027s soul, and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.\\n\\n She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned spoons, the fat silver tea-pot, and the glasses, till they shone. Then she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was! Not a speck escaped Aunt March\u0027s eye, and all the furniture had claw legs, and much carving, which was never dusted to suit. Then Polly must be fed, the lap-dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down, to get things, to deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame, and seldom left her big chair. After these tiresome labours, she must do her lessons, which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play, and didn\u0027t she enjoy it? Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March, till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode, and had capital times. After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page. Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till tea-time. The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.\\n\\n If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time. The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking at him while Madam dozed; called her names before company, and behaved in all respects like a reprehensible old bird. Then she could not endure the dog - a fat, cross beast, who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back, with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was bad-tempered, the old coachman deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady.\\n\\n Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with `Madame\u0027, as she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady, who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to change her religion. She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her very much, with odd stories of her life in France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame\u0027s laces. She also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests; for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy\u0027s chief delight was an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel-cases, in which, on velvet cushions, reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover\u0027s diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, and queer rockets, with portraits of dead friends, and weeping willows made of hair inside; the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn; Uncle March\u0027s big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in a box, all by itself, lay Aunt March\u0027s wedding-ring, too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away, like the most precious jewel of them all.\\n\\n Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?\u0027 asked Esther, who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.\\n\\n I liked the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I\u0027m fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. I should choose this if I might,\u0027 replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads, from which hung a heavy cross of the same.\\n\\n I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace; ah, no! to me it is a rosary, and as such I should use it like a good Catholic,\u0027 said Esther, eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.\\n\\n Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads hanging over your glass?\u0027 asked Amy.\\n\\n Truly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou. If Mademoiselle went apart each day to meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame, it would be well. She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much trouble.\u0027\\n\\n Would it be right for me to do so too?\u0027 asked Amy, who, in her loneliness, felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind her of it.\\n\\n It would be excellent and charming; and I shall gladly arrange the little dressing-room for you if you like it. Say nothing to Madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and pray the dear God to preserve your sister.\u0027\\n\\n Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice; for she had an affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. Amy liked the idea and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room, hoping it would do her good.\\n\\n I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March dies,\u0027 she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary, and shut the jewel-cases one by one.\\n\\n To you and your sisters. I know it; Madame confides in me; I witnessed her will, and it is to be so,\u0027 whispered Esther, smiling.\\n\\n How nice! but I wish she\u0027d let us have them now. Procras-ti-nation is not agreeable,\u0027 observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.\\n\\n It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The first one who is affianced will have the pearls - Madame has said it; and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go, for Madame approves your good behaviour and charming manners.\\n\\n Do you think so? Oh, I\u0027ll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely ring! It\u0027s ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant\u0027s. I do like Aunt March after all\u0027; and Amy tried on the blue ring with a delightful face, and a firm resolve to earn it.\\n\\n From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training. Esther fitted up the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought it was of no great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that Madame would never know it, nor care if she did. It Was, however, a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and Amy\u0027s beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the divine mother, while tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart. On the table she laid her little testament and hymn-book, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every day to sit alone, `thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear God to preserve her sister\u0027. Esther had given her a rosary of black beads, with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling more than doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.\\n\\n The little girl was very sincere in all this, for, being left alone outside the safe home-nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely, that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender friend, Whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children. She missed her mother\u0027s help to understand and rule herself, but having been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way, and walk in it confidingly. But Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will, as Aunt March had done; so that if she did fall ill and die, her possessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old lady\u0027s jewels.\\n\\n During one of her play-hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms, and, when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt relieved, and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second witness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes, with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favourite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long mirror, making stately courtesies, and sweeping her train about, with a rustle which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she did not hear Laurie\u0027s ring, nor see his face peeping in at her, as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo afterwards, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, `Ain\u0027t we fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha! ha!\u0027\\n\\n Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment lest it should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped, and was graciously received.\\n\\n Sit down and rest while I put these things away; then I want to consult you about a very serious matter,\u0027 said Amy, when she had shown her splendour, and driven Polly into a corner. `That bird is the trial of my life,\u0027 she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while Laurie seated himself astride of a chair. `Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep, and I was trying to be as still as a mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage; so I went to let him out, and found a big spider there. I poked it out, and it ran under the book-case; Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the book-case, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, \"Come out and take a walk, my dear.\" I couldn\u0027t help laughing, which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.\u0027\\n\\n Did the spider accept the old fellow\u0027s invitation?\u0027 asked Laurie, yawning.\\n\\n Yes; out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and scrambled up on Aunt\u0027s chair, calling out, \"Catch her! catch her! catch her!\" as I chased the spider.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s a lie! Oh, lor!\u0027 cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie\u0027s toes.\\n\\n I\u0027d wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,\u0027 cried Laurie, shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side, and gravely croaked, `Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!\u0027\\n\\n Now I\u0027m ready,\u0027 said Amy, shutting the wardrobe, and taking a paper out of her pocket. `I want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is legal and right. I felt that I ought to do it, for life is uncertain and I don\u0027t want any ill-feeling over my tomb.\u0027\\n\\n Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the spelling:\\n\\n My Last Will And Testament\u0027\\n\\n I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, do give and bequeath all my earthly property - viz., to wit: - namely\\n\\n To my Father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he likes with.\\n\\n To my Mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets - also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.\\n\\n To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her \"little girl\".\\n\\n To Jo I leave my breast-pin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my bronze inkstand - she lost the cover - and my most precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burnt up her story.\\n\\n To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau, my fan, my linen collars, and my new slippers if she can wear them being thin when she gets well. And I herewith also leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.\\n\\n To my friend and neighbour Theodore Laurence I bequeath my paper marshay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn\u0027t any neck. Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.\\n\\n To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favours to her family, specially Beth.\\n\\n I wish my favourite play mate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron and my gold bead ring with a kiss.\\n\\n To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patch work I leave hoping she will \"remember me, when it you see\".\\n\\n And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead. I forgive everyone, and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound. Amen.\\n\\n To this will and testament I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of Nov. Anni Domino 1861.\\n\\n Amy Curtis March.\\n\\n Witnesses\\n\\n Estelle Valnor\\n\\n Theodore Laurence.\u0027\\n\\n The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink, and seal it up for her properly.\\n\\n What put it into your head? Did anyone tell you about Beth\u0027s giving away her things?\u0027 asked Laurie, soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape, with sealing-wax, a taper, and a standish before him.\\n\\n She explained; and then asked anxiously, `What about Beth?\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027m sorry I spoke: but as I did I\u0027ll tell you. She felt so ill one day that she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake. She was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest of us, and her best love to grandpa. She never thought of a will.\u0027\\n\\n Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper. Amy\u0027s face was full of trouble; but she only said, `Don\u0027t people put sort of postscripts to their wills, sometimes?\u0027\\n\\n Yes; \"codicils\", they call them.\u0027\\n\\n Put one in mine, then - that I wish all my curls cut off, and given round to my friends. I forgot it; but I want it done, though it will spoil my looks.\u0027\\n\\n Laurie added it, smiling at Amy\u0027s last and greatest sacrifice. Then he amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. But when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper, with trembling lips, `Is there really any danger about Beth?\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027m afraid there is; but we must hope for the best, so don\u0027t cry, dear\u0027; and Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting.\\n\\n When he had gone, she went to her little room, and sitting in the twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart, feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister.\\n\\n \\n\\n 当家里发生这一连串事情的时候，艾美正在马奇太太家中挨日子。此刻她深深体会到寄人篱下的滋味，第一次认识到自己在家里是如何受到亲人的宠爱。马奇婶婶从不宠爱人，她不赞成这样；当然也是出于好意，因为小姑娘的表现十分讨她的欢心，而老人对侄儿几个孩子心里也未尝不爱，但她认为这种爱不宜表露出来。她的确在竭尽全力要令艾美幸福，但是，老天作证，她的方法却糟糕透顶！一些老人尽管皱纹累累、白发苍苍，心中却仍然充满朝气，能够和孩子们同忧共喜，友好相处，使他们感到无拘无束，并能寓教于乐，以最温柔的方式给予和得到友谊。不幸的是马奇婶婶却没有这个天分，她规矩森严，整日板着一副面孔，说话啰啰嗦嗦，冗长乏味，令艾美吃尽了苦头。发现艾美比她的姐姐更乖巧听话，老太太觉得自己有责任把她从家里带来的娇气和懒气尽量铲除掉。因此她把艾美置于股掌之中，用自己六十年前所接受的教育方法来教导她-其结果只有令艾美越发糊涂，她觉得自己像只落网苍蝇，落到了一个一丝不苟的蜘蛛手上。\\n\\n 她每天早上都得洗净茶杯，把旧式汤匙、一个圆肚银茶壶、几面镜子擦拭得锃光发亮。接着便得打扫房间，这个任务非同小可！几乎没有一粒尘埃可以躲得过马奇婶婶的眼睛，而家具全部都是爪型腿脚，并刻有很多永远打扫不干净的浮雕。然后又得喂鹦哥，给叭儿狗梳毛，还得取东西，传达命令，楼上楼下跑上十多个来回，因为老太太腿疾严重，极少离开自己的大座椅。干完这些累人的活儿后，她还得做一件伤透脑筋的事- 做功课。之后她可以自由活动一个小时，这是她最心花怒放的时候。劳里每天都过来，甜言蜜语地哄马奇婶婶，直到她答应让艾美跟他一同外出为止。然后他们一齐散步、骑马，尽兴而归。吃过午饭后，她得大声朗读，并坐着一动不动，老太太则在打瞌睡，常常是一页没听完就睡着了，一睡就是一个小时。接着是缝缀各色布匹或缝制手巾，艾美表面不敢言语，心里却在拼命反抗，就这样一直缝到傍晚，才可以随意玩玩，一直玩到吃茶时间。晚上的时光最为难熬，因为马奇婶婶开始大讲她年青时候的故事，这些故事沉闷不堪，艾美每次都盼着上床睡觉，打算为自己的悲惨命运一哭，但每次都是还没有挤出一星半点眼泪便已睡着了。\\n\\n 如果不是有劳里和女佣人埃丝特老人，这种日子简直是一天也过不下去。单单是那只鹦鹉就足以令她神经错乱，因为它不久便发觉艾美并不喜欢自己，于是做出种种淘气异常的事来，以泄心头之愤。每当她走到跟前，它便抓她的头发，她刚洗净了鸟笼，它便把面包和牛奶打翻，趁夫人打瞌睡又去啄\"莫普\"，把它弄得吠叫不止，还在客人面前叫她的名字，总之一举一动都表现得十足一个该死的破鸟。她也忍受不了那只狗 -一只肥胖、无礼的畜牲，每逢给它洗澡它就向她狂吼怒叫，当它想吃东西时，它就以背着地躺倒地上，四脚朝天，脸上一副痴呆的表情，而这样求食一天足有十余次之多。厨师脾气粗暴，年老的马车夫是个聋子，唯一理会她的人只有埃丝特。\\n\\n 埃丝特是个法国女人，她和\"夫人\"，她这样称呼自己的女主人，共同生活了多年，对老太太有一定的操纵权，因为老太太没有她便活不下去。她的真名叫做埃丝特尔，但马奇太太命她更改名字，她遵从了，条件是永远不能要求她改变自己的宗教信仰。她喜欢上了艾美小姐，和她一起坐时常常一边烫\"夫人\"的花边，一边跟她讲自己在法国遇到的奇闻怪事，令艾美大开眼界。她还允许\"小姐\"在这间大屋子里头四处游荡，仔细欣赏藏在大衣橱和旧式柜子里的奇珍异宝，因为马奇婶婶藏品极多。艾美最中意的是一个印度木柜，内设许多奇形怪状的抽屉、小分类架和暗格，里头装着各种各样的饰物，有些贵重，有些只是怪异而已，都或多或少有了一些年头。欣赏和摆弄这些东西给予艾美一种巨大的满足感，尤其是那些珠宝箱子，天鹅绒垫子上摆着各式四十年前装点美女的首饰。这里头有一套马奇婶婶出席社交场合戴的石榴石饰物、她出阁时父亲送给她的珠宝、情人的钻石、出席葬礼戴的煤玉戒指和发夹，还有一些怪模怪样的金属小盒子，里头镶着已故朋友的照片、头发制成的垂柳、她一个小女儿戴过的婴儿手镯、马奇叔叔的大挂表和被许多小孩把玩过的红印章。马奇婶婶的结婚戒子大模大样地摆在一个盒子里，因为她的手指长胖了，现在已经戴不进去，于是被当作最最宝贵的珠宝小心翼翼地收藏起来。\\n\\n “如果她立遗嘱，小姐想选哪一样呢？”埃丝特问。她总是坐在跟前看守着，并把贵重物品锁起来。\\n\\n “我最爱这些钻石，可惜里头没有项链，而我最喜欢项链，它们漂亮极了，如果可能，我就选这一个，”艾美答道，羡慕不已地望着一串纯金乌木珠链，链子上头沉甸甸地挂着一个用相同材料做成的十字架。\\n\\n “我也瞄着这个呢，但并非想要来做项链；啊，不！在我眼里它是一串念珠，我要虔诚地持着它诵经祈祷，”埃丝特说道，若有所思地端详着漂亮的首饰。\\n\\n “你的意思是把它当作挂在你镜子上头的那串香木珠链一样使用吗？”艾美问。\\n\\n “对，正是这样，用来做祷告。如果我们用这么精美的东西来做念珠，而不是把它当作轻薄的珠宝来佩戴，圣神们一定更高兴。”“你似乎能从自己的祷告中寻找到极大安慰，埃丝特，每次祷告后你都显得平静、满足。但愿我也能这样。”“如果小姐是个天主教徒，就能找到真正的安慰；既然不是，你也不妨每天独处一室，思考并祈祷，我在夫人之前侍候的那位好女主人便是这样。她有个小教堂，在那里她找到了极大的安慰。”“我这样做合适吗？”艾美问。她在孤独寂寞中深感需要一种帮助，由于贝思不在身边提醒自己，她觉得自己都快要把那本小册子给忘掉了。\\n\\n “那将再好不过，如果你喜欢，我很乐意把化妆室收拾好给你用。不用告诉夫人，她睡觉时你可以进去静坐一会，幽思反省，祈求上帝保佑你姐姐。”埃丝特十分虔诚，真情相劝，因为她心地善良，对艾美姐妹们的处境感同身受。艾美觉得这个主意不错，便同意她把自己房间隔壁一个光线明亮的小密室收拾出来，希望这样能对自己有帮助。\\n\\n “不知马奇婶婶死后这些好东西流落何方，”她一面说，一面慢腾腾地把光彩照人的念珠放回原处，把珠宝箱逐一关上。\\n\\n “落到你和你几个姐姐手上。这个我知道，夫人常向我诉说心事。我看过她的遗嘱，不会有错，”埃丝特耳语道，一边微笑。\\n\\n “好极了！不过我希望她现在就能给我们。拖延时间并非什么好事，”艾美一面评论一面向那些钻石望了最后一眼。\\n\\n “年青女士佩戴这些首饰为时尚早。谁第一个订婚就可以得到那套珍珠首饰- 夫人这样说过。我想你离开时会得到那只小绿松石戒指，因为夫人认为你举止有礼，规矩听话。”“是吗？噢，如果真的能得到那个漂亮戒指，即使做个小羊羔我也是甘心的！它比吉蒂·布莱恩的不知要好看多少倍。\\n\\n 不论怎么说，我还是喜欢马奇婶婶的。”艾美兴冲冲地把那只蓝色戒指戴上试试，下定决心要得到它。\\n\\n 从这天开始她成了驯服听话的典范，老太太看到自己的训练大见成效，喜得心花怒放。埃丝特在小房间里放上一张小桌子，前面摆一张脚凳，上面挂一幅从一间锁着的屋子里拿来的图画。她认为这画没有什么价值，但因合适，便把它借来，心里以为夫人永远不会知道，即使知道了也不会管。殊不知这是一幅价值连城的世界名画。爱美的艾美仰望着圣母亲切温柔的面孔，心里头千丝万缕，百感交集，眼睛从不觉得一点疲倦。她在桌上放上自己的小圣约书和赞美诗集，摆上一个花瓶，每天换上劳里带来的最美丽的花儿，并来\"静坐一会，幽思反省，祈求上帝保佑姐姐\"。埃丝特送给她一串带银十字架的黑色念珠，但艾美怀疑它是否适合新教徒做祈祷用，只是把它挂在一边。\\n\\n 这小女孩儿做这一切是非常诚挚的。由于离开了安全温暖的家，一个人孤身在外，她强烈地感到需要一双善良的手扶她一把，于是本能地向那位强大而慈悲的\"朋友\"求助，他父亲般的爱是如此亲近地环抱着他幼小的孩子们。她一度忘记了母亲要独立思考和自我约束的话，但现在有人向她指点了方向，她便努力去寻找道路，并义无反顾地踏上行程。不过艾美是个新香客，此刻她肩上的担子似乎万分沉重。她试图忘掉自己，保持乐观，问心无愧地做人，尽管没有人看到，也没有人为此而赞扬她。为了使自己非常非常地好，她作出的第一个努力是，像马奇婶婶那样立一个遗嘱，这样假使她真的身染沉疴撒手尘寰，她的财产也可以得到公平慷慨的分割。只要一想到跟自己小小的\"珍藏\"分手，她便心如刀割，因为她把这些小玩意看得跟老太太的珠宝一样珍贵。\\n\\n 她花了一小时娱乐时间绞尽脑汁拟出这份重要文件，埃丝特帮助她纠正某些法律用词。当这位好心的法国女人签上自己的大名后，艾美舒了一口气，把它放在一边，准备拿给圣约是指《圣经》中神与人之间立的誓约，小圣约书指艾美的那本小册24子。\\n\\n 劳里看，她希望他做自己的第二证人。因这天下雨，她走到楼上一间大房子里找点开心的事做，并带上鹦哥作伴。房子里放着满满一衣橱的旧式戏服，埃丝特允许她穿着这些戏服玩，她于是乐此不疲，穿上褪了色的锦缎衣裳，对着全身镜来回检阅，行仪态万千的屈膝礼，穿着长裙摇曳而行，让它发出悦耳的瑟瑟声。这一天她忙得不亦乐乎，连劳里敲门也没有听到。劳里悄悄探头望进去，恰好见到她手摇扇子，摇头摆脑，煞有介事地踱过来踱过去。她头上缠一条巨大的粉红色头巾，与身上穿着的蓝缎子衣裳和胀鼓鼓的黄裙子相映成趣，由于穿着高跟鞋，走路必须十分谨慎，正如劳里事后向乔所述，她穿着鲜艳夺目的服装忸忸怩怩，鹦哥紧跟后面，时而缩头缩脑，时而昂首挺胸，全力模仿她的一举一动，偶尔又停下来笑一声或高叫：“我们不是挺好吗？去你的，丑八怪！闭嘴！亲亲我，宝贝！哈！哈！”其情其景，令人捧腹。\\n\\n 劳里好不容易才忍住了即将爆发出来的笑声，以免惹怒公主殿下。他敲敲门，艾美优雅地把他迎进去。\\n\\n “坐下歇一会，待我把这些东西卸掉，我有一件十分严肃的事情要跟你商量，“在展示完自己的光彩并把鹦哥赶到一角后，她这样说。”这只鸟真是我命中的克星，”她接着又说，一面摘下头上粉红色的庞然大物。劳里则跨坐在一张椅子上。\\n\\n “昨天，婶婶睡着了，我正敛息不敢吱一声，鹦哥却在笼子里尖声高叫，乱七乱动；我便过去把它放出来，发现笼子里有一只大蜘蛛，我用火钳把它捅出来，它却溜到书架下面；鹦哥紧追过去，弯低脖子向书架下面瞪直双眼，怪模怪样地说：\u0027出来散个步，宝贝。\u0027我忍不住笑出了声，鹦哥听到叫骂起来，婶婶被吵醒了，把我们两个痛斥一顿。”“蜘蛛接受了那老家伙的邀请吗？”劳里打了个呵欠，问。\\n\\n “接受了，它走出来，鹦哥却拔脚就跑，吓得半死，它狠命跳到婶婶椅子上，一面看我追蜘蛛一面大叫：\u0027抓住她！抓住她！抓住她！\u0027”“撒谎！呵，上帝！”鹦鹉叫起来，又去啄劳里的脚趾。\\n\\n “如果你是我养的我就拧断你的脖子，你这孽畜！”劳里向鸟儿晃晃头叫道。鹦哥把头一侧躲过，扯着嗓子庄严地嘎嘎大叫：“阿利路亚！上帝保佑，宝贝！”“好了。”艾美把衣橱门关上，从口袋里掏出一张纸。”我想请你看看这份文件，告诉我它是否合法、妥当。我觉得我应该这样做，因为生命无常，我不想死后引起纷争，令大家不快。”劳里咂咂嘴唇，把眼光从这位悲天悯人的朋友身上移开，微微背转身子，带着颇值嘉许的认真劲头读起了下面这份有错字的文件：我的遗愿和遗属我，艾美·科蒂斯·马奇，在此心智健全之际，把我的全部财产曾（赠）送并遗曾（赠）如下- 即，就是--也就是给父亲：我最好的图画、素描、地图及艺术品，包括画框。还有一百美元给他自由支配。\\n\\n 给母亲：诚挚送上我的全部衣服，有口袋的蓝围裙除外--以及我的肖像、奖章。\\n\\n 给亲爱的姐姐玛格丽特：曾（赠）送我的录（绿）松石戒指（如果我能得到），以及装鸽子用的录（绿）色箱子，以及我的上等花边给她戴，还有我给她画的肖像，以纪念她的“小姑娘\"。\\n\\n 给乔，我留给她我的胸针，被封蜡补过的那个，以及我的铜墨水台 -她弄丢了盖子- 还有我最珍爱的塑胶兔子，因为我很后悔烧掉了她的故事。\\n\\n 给贝思（如果我先她而去）我送给她我的玩偶和小衣柜、扇子、亚麻布衣领和我的新鞋子，如果她病好后身体瘦弱可以穿下的话。在此我一并为以前取笑过乔安娜而致歉。\\n\\n 给我的朋友和邻居西奥多·劳伦斯，我遗曾（赠）我的制型纸文件夹，陶土模型马，虽然他说过这马没有颈。以及他喜欢的我的任何一件艺术品，以报答他在我们痛苦之际对我们的大恩大德，最好是《圣母玛利亚》。\\n\\n 给我们尊敬的恩人劳伦斯先生我留给他一面盖子上镶有镜子的紫色盒子，这给他装钢笔用最为漂亮，并可以使他睹物思人，想起那位对他感激涕零的逝去了的姑娘。她感谢他帮助了她一家，尤其是贝思。\\n\\n 我希望我最要好的伙伴吉蒂·布莱恩得到那条28妇人蓝绸缎围裙和我的金殊戒子，连同一吻。\\n\\n 给罕娜我送她想要的硬纸匣和我留下的全部拼凑布匹，希望她“看到它时就会想起我\"。\\n\\n 我最有价值的财产现已处理完毕，我希望大家满意，不会责备死者。我原谅所有人，并相信号角响起时我们会再见。阿门。\\n\\n 我于今天公元一八六一年十一月二十日在此遗属（嘱）上签字盖章。\\n\\n 艾美·科蒂斯·马奇\\n\\n 证人：\\n\\n 埃丝特尔·梵尔奈\\n\\n 西奥多·劳伦斯\\n\\n 最后一个名字是用铅笔写上的，艾美解释说他要用墨水笔重写一次。并替她把文件妥善封好。\\n\\n “你怎么会想出这个主意？有人告诉你贝思要分派自己的东西了吗？”劳里严肃地问。此时艾美在他面前放上一段扎文件用的红带，连同封蜡、一支小蜡烛、一个墨水台。\\n\\n 她于是解释一番，然后焦急地问：“贝思怎么样？”“我本不该说的，但既然说了，我便告诉你。一天她觉得自己已病入膏肓，便告诉乔她想把她的钢琴送给梅格，她的猫儿给你，她可怜的旧玩偶给乔，乔会为她而爱惜这个玩偶的，她很遗憾自己没有更多的东西留给大家，便把自己的头发一人一绺分给我们和其他人、把挚爱留给爷爷。她根本没想到什么遗嘱。”劳里一面说一面签字盖章，久久没有抬起头来，直到一颗硕大的泪珠慢慢滑落到纸上。艾美神色大变；但她只是问道：“人们有时会在遗嘱上加插附言之类的东西吗？”“会的，他们把它叫做\u0027补遗\u0027。”“那么我的也加上一条--我希望把我的鬈发通通剪掉，分送给朋友们留念。我刚才忘了，但我想现在补上，虽然这会毁掉我的相貌。”劳里把这条加上去，为艾美作出这最后一个也是最伟大的一个牺牲而微笑起来。之后他又陪她玩了一个小时，并耐心听她倾吐苦水。当他准备告辞时，艾美把他拉住，颤抖着嘴唇悄声问道：“贝思是不是真会有什么危险？”“恐怕是这样，但我们必须抱最好的希望。别哭，亲爱的。”劳里像哥哥一样伸出手臂护着她，使她感到了莫大的安慰。\\n\\n 劳里走后，她来到自己的小教堂，静坐于蒙蒙暮光之中，为贝思祈祷，一面心酸落泪。假如失去了温柔可爱的小姐姐，即使有一千个一万个绿松石戒指，也不能给她带来安慰埃\\n\\n \\n\\n
