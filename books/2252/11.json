{"id":86280,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Outside Reverend Burton\u0027s cabin the darkness closed in, rain fell in sheets upon the wilderness, the thunder boomed and lightning streaked across the heavens. Just another night in New Jersey, some might have said.\n Inside the cabin, though, the crackling fire issued forth a convivial warmth, the light of candles spread what in a tavern would have been a friendly glow, and the delicious smell of the rabbit stew bubbling in an iron kettle in the hearth would have made Sally almond crave the recipe. Tom had shown himself to be a true gift from God, at least in terms of cooking; a few mushrooms, wild onions, potatoes and carrots into the kettle with the pieces of rabbit meat, a little added brandy from the flask that Greathouse had offered around to those who did not wear chains or have four legs, and for the moment a small cameo of comfort had returned to New Unity.\n Wooden bowls were set at the table, and portions of the stew scooped into them with a wooden ladle. Tom set aside a smaller portion in a bowl for James, who Matthew noted was never far from the boy\u0027s touch. The two chairs by the fireplace were pulled over to join the two at the table, which left Slaughter to say, \"I presume, then, that I\u0027ll be eating with the dogi\"\n \"You\u0027ll eat on the floor and be happy about it.\" Greathouse put a bowl down for the prisoner. The great one\u0027s cap and coat hung on a wallpeg behind him, his shirtsleeves rolled up.\n The reverend said with great dignity, \"May I remind you, Mr. Greathouse, that this is my homei In all the time I\u0027ve lived here no guest has ever been forced to eat his meal from the floor. I\u0027d take it very kindly if that hospitality goes unblemished, in the good name of Christ.\"\n \"I think he ought to-\"\n \"He can sit on the footstool,\" Burton interrupted crisply. \"Would you help him upi Or shall you have an old man do iti\"\n Greathouse looked to Matthew for support, but all Matthew could do was shrug, for it was clear Reverend Burton was firm in his humanity, even to those who might be less human than others. Still, Matthew could tell Greathouse was restraining an oath behind his clenched teeth as he put the prisoner\u0027s bowl up on the table and then reached down to help Slaughter struggle up.\n as Matthew brought the footstool over, Slaughter said to Burton, \"Thank you for your kindness, sir, but I might ask for one more Christian favor. These irons will make sitting at your fine table an exercise in torment for my back, and if you might see fit that I be-\"\n \"No.\" Greathouse had him by the scruff of the neck. \"You\u0027ll make do.\"\n \"One moment. Mister Slaughteri Might I ask that, if your irons are removed, you vow to comport yourself as a gentleman and cause no troublei\"\n \"Sir!\" Greathouse was starting to get red in the face. \"He\u0027s our prisoner, do you understand thati He\u0027s a killer. There\u0027s no sense in taking the irons off him!\"\n \"I vow whatever you please,\" Slaughter said. \"and it\u0027s true, pastor, that I\u0027ve sinned much, but also true that I\u0027ve been much sinned against.\"\n Burton nodded. Tom helped him ease into a chair at the head of the table. \"Remove his irons,\" said the reverend. \"No man shall sit at my table in chains.\"\n \"Oh, for the love of-\" Greathouse stopped himself only by biting his tongue.\n \"Precisely,\" said Burton. He tilted his head. \"Listen to that rain come down!\"\n Greathouse took the key from his shirt. \"Matthew, get the pistol and bring it over here, will youi\" Matthew obeyed, and he held it ready as Greathouse unlocked first the leg irons and then the manacles. When the chains fell away Slaughter stood up to his full height and the bones of his spine cracked.\n \"ahhhh!\" Slaughter stretched, holding his arms toward the ceiling. It seemed to Matthew, disconcertingly, that the prisoner was an inch or two taller than he\u0027d appeared at the asylum. \"Nothing makes a man hungrier than being out of his irons. I\u0027m in your debt, parson.\" He sat down on the footstool, which was between the chairs meant for Matthew and Greathouse and across from Tom\u0027s seat.\n Greathouse took the pistol, sat down and kept his eyes on Slaughter as Tom went about pouring apple cider from a jug into small brown cups for them. Then, when everyone was arranged, Burton led them in a short prayer-during which neither Greathouse nor Matthew dared close their eyes-and Slaughter was the first to smack his lips and dig into his stew with a wooden spoon and his fingers.\n They ate as hungry men do, without speaking. James finished his meal and came around to ask for more. Matthew noted that Tom resisted for awhile, but soon slipped a piece of rabbit from his own bowl down to his friend.\n Matthew had been studying Tom while the stew was being cooked. The boy seemed silent by nature, closed up in a world of his own. Something about him resisted questions even before the questions had been asked. He had examined the visitors on first meeting, true, but after that he seemed not to care very much about them. He was a handsome boy, with a high forehead and a craggy nose that looked to have once been broken. His hair was more of a dark stain, being shaved to the scalp. Matthew had once worn his hair the same way, to combat the spread of lice. Tom had a strong square jaw and thick black brows above piercing light gray eyes. He was slimly-built, but nothing about him suggested weakness; in fact, he moved with a quickness and economy that said he was both physically strong and equally swift. Matthew thought the boy would\u0027ve been a good candidate for Greathouse\u0027s sword-fighting lessons. Now, as Matthew continued to examine the boy, Tom looked up from his bowl and stared across the table at him, with a brief panther-like glare that asked the question What are you looking ati Immediately Matthew dropped his gaze and said, \"Good stew.\"\n There was no response from Tom, who went back to his eating as if nothing had been said.\n \"I saw evidence of a horse in the barn,\" Greathouse said in between sips of the cider. The pistol lay beside his bowl, aimed in Slaughter\u0027s direction. \"My team will appreciate the oats, for sure. But what happened to your horsei\"\n \"We had to sell her,\" Burton offered. \"Tom rode her to Belvedere just last week, to trade for some things we needed. Candles, salt, sugar. Those things.\"\n \"and how far is Belvedere, theni\"\n \"Oh twelve miles, I suppose.\"\n \"Fourteen,\" said the boy, without looking up.\n Greathouse paused with the cup at his lips. \"You\u0027re not going to tell me you rode a horse to this Belvedere place and walked back here fourteen miles carrying a sackful of supplies, are youi\"\n Tom shrugged. The silent answer was all right, I won\u0027t.\n \"a stout-hearted lad!\" Slaughter raised his cup. \"This world needs more of them!\"\n \"Reverend Burton told me how you lost your parents,\" Matthew ventured. The boy seemingly paid him no attention. \"I lost mine in much the same way. Don\u0027t you have any other familyi\"\n Tom said nothing. He was finishing his stew, but kept a bit of rabbit to hand down to James. Then he spoke, as if the question were of no consequence: \"a grandpa in aberdeen. That\u0027s all.\"\n \"Hail to the Scots!\" Slaughter said.\n \"I can take care of m\u0027self.\" Tom lifted his gaze to spear Matthew with it, and then he drank down some more of his cider to put an end to this line of conversation.\n Thunder spoke above the cabin. Rain slashed at the shutters. James, unperturbed by the roar of nature, sat down next to Tom\u0027s foot and scratched at a flea.\n \"Greathouse.\" Slaughter had reached the bottom of his bowl. He licked juice from his fingers. \"I don\u0027t know that name, but I swear you\u0027re familiar. Were you ever a circus performeri\"\n \"No. Were youi\"\n \"Oh, absolutely. In my youth I was an acrobat. Quite accomplished if I might say so. I had a female partner, and together we jumped through hoops of fire. Have you ever seen a circusi\" The last question was presented to Tom, whose only answer was to reach down and rub his dog\u0027s back.\n \"I regret your situation here,\" said Greathouse to the reverend. \"Can we do anything to helpi\"\n \"No. I just thank God the suffering is over.\" Burton rubbed his right temple, as if at the pain of memory. \"They were such good people. So hopeful. and we were doing so well, for awhile. New Unity started as an apple orchard. There are fertile fields between here and the river, you see. More and more people came in, and then the fever struck. It was a terrible thing, sir. Terrible, to see all those people suffering, and begging over dying loved ones for the mercy of God, and yet all I could do was pray. a doctor was brought from Belvedere, and he did all he could but what could be done, against such an enemyi The doctor himself fell ill, and perished. Then my wife.\" He put his frail hand against his forehead. The thunder boomed again, off to the east. \"My wife of fifty-two years, my lovely bride. Coughed herself to death, and squeezed my hand at the last, and I whispered, Wait for me, abigail, please wait for me. But there were so many others in torment. I couldn\u0027t think only of myself, and my loss. I had to be strong, for the others. The young children who died, the mothers who watched their infants go pale and more and more unto deathly white. The strapping young men, with such great dreams, and the women who had come here with them to build a life. and there they lie, in the graves. Peaceful now, I hope. But oh, sirs, they endured so much.\"\n a silence fell, but for the sounds of the fire and the rain.\n Quite suddenly, Tyranthus Slaughter began to laugh.\n \"Shut your mouth!\" Greathouse, his cheeks aflame, grabbed hold of the prisoner\u0027s beard and twisted it.\n Slaughter kept laughing, as tears of either mirth or pain glittered in his eyes.\n \"Shut it, I said!\" Greathouse shouted. James was up on four feet, starting a low gut-growl, but Tom put his hand down on the back of the dog\u0027s neck to hold him steady.\n \"Pardon me! Pardon me!\" Slaughter tried to swallow his laughter and began to cough, so violently that Greathouse released him. Matthew didn\u0027t know what to think. The madman\u0027s wagon had lost its wheels. \"Pardon me!\" Slaughter repeated, as he wiped his eyes and his nose and drew in a long ragged breath of air. \"It just it just strikes me as so funny so ridiculous that none of you have a goddamned idea of-\" and on the final four words his eyes cleared, his voice tightened and he reached up to rub his raw chin beneath the patchwork beard. \"What real suffering is.\"\n \"apologize to the reverend!\" Greathouse demanded, with such force the spittle foamed on his lips. \"By God I\u0027ll smash your face in if you don\u0027t!\" already his fist was clenched and the blow about to be struck.\n Slaughter stared at the upraised fist. He reached into his mouth with a forefinger and probed at an offending shred of rabbit stuck between upper teeth. \"I shall apologize, sir,\" he said lightly, \"if the company will hear my tale of suffering.\"\n The fist was near being thrown. Matthew knew a bloody mess was about to erupt. \"Don\u0027t do it,\" he cautioned, and Greathouse\u0027s enraged eyes ticked toward him. The cocked fist was slowly lowered.\n \"Let him speak,\" said Reverend Burton, his opaque gaze fixed on the space between Greathouse and the prisoner. \"Go ahead, sir, but I ask you to refrain from taking our Lord\u0027s name in vain.\"\n \"Thank you. Might I have another cup of cideri Just to wet the old whistlei\"\n Burton nodded, and Tom did the pouring.\n Slaughter took a long drink and swirled the liquid around in his mouth before he swallowed. Then he put the cup down before him and turned it between his fingers, with their jagged clawlike nails.\n Thunder echoed in the distance. a second voice of the storm spoke, nearer still.\n \"There was a boy,\" said Slaughter. \"a hardworking young English boy. Whose drunken mother had been murdered in a tavern brawl when he was not quite ten, and her blood spattered his legs, but that is neither here nor there. This upright young boy and his father went out upon the world, and as fate would have it both of them found positions in the mining fields of Swansea. Diggers, they were. Shovel-and-pick men. Handgrubbers, down in the earth. a father and son, blackened together inside and out, black grit in their teeth and in their eyes, and all the day the ringing music of the pit, hour upon hour, for that pretty little pence in their palms. Or rather, in the father\u0027s palm, for the boy did so wish that his father might become rich someday, and stride the world as an earl, or a duke. Someone who mattered, in the course of time. Someone he might be proud of. You seei\"\n No one answered. Slaughter lifted a finger. \"ah, that boy! Quite the worker, he was. He and his father, breaking rocks in that mine from sunup \u0027til sundown. Or was it from sundown \u0027til sunupi What is time, where there is only the light of the lanterns, and all seasons are damp and musty as the tombi But then, gentlemen, came the hour of disaster!\" He nodded, looking from one face to the other. \"Disaster,\" he repeated, letting the word hiss. \"a cracking noise, small as the sound of a rat biting a bone. Followed by a rumble that built to a roar, but by then the roof was falling. Thunder is no equal to such a noise, sirs. and afterward, the cries and moans of those trapped by the rock swell up in the dark, and echo in the chambers like a cathedral of the damned. Eleven diggers had gone down, to scoop out the last of a worn-out hole. Five were killed outright. Six left alive, in various states of life. One had a tinderbox and got it lit. Two unbroken lamps were found, and some candles in a dead man\u0027s sack. There the boy was, waiting for rescue, while his father lay a few feet away with both his legs crushed. and oh, how that man could caterwaul! It shamed the boy, really, to have to witness such indignity.\"\n \"When they stuffed a dead man\u0027s shirt into the father\u0027s mouth, they were at last able to hear help coming,\" Slaughter went on, as lightning streaked white beyond the shutters and thunder growled overhead. \"They shouted to let the diggers know they were still alive. They had air, that was all right. and water, a flask or two. They could hold on, until the diggers got them up. and then-who can say when-there came another little crack of a rat bite and boom fell more rock and dust. a storm of it. a whirlwind. But they relit their lanterns, and held on. as the candles burned down. as the last of the beef sausage was eaten. Once more they heard the diggers coming. Coming closer, hour after hour. Or was it day after dayi and then again, boom fell the rocks, and this time the man who\u0027d lit his tinderbox fell dead, his brains burst out upon the black wall. Which left five living, if one includes the boy\u0027s father, who by now had suffered the agony that renders a human being somewhat less than human.\"\n Slaughter paused to drink again from his cup, and licked his lips when he\u0027d finished. \"They waited. The diggers were coming. They had one lantern left, and a few candles. Hope remained. Even when the father drew his last breath, and his eyes grew cold and white and the life left him like a bitter mist hope remained. and then someone-the old soldier with the gray beard, the one from Sheffield-said Listen. He said, Listen, I don\u0027t hear them anymore. Of course they all hollered and shouted until their lungs were raw, but the noise made more rubble fall and they were afraid to lose their lantern, and so they just sat and waited, in a little foul chamber that was filling up with the smell of the dead. They sat and waited, there in the earth, as the candles burned down one after the other and the waterflasks emptied and oh yes the hunger started gnawing their bellies. They became weaker, and weaker still. and finally someone said, I think they\u0027ve left us. Left us, he said, to rot. and someone else went mad, and gibbered until he was hit over the head with a stone, and another wept in a corner and prayed to Jesus on his knees, but the boy vowed I will not die, here in this hole. I will not be left to rot, thrown away like garbage for the worms.\"\n \"So,\" Slaughter said quietly, as the low red firelight played across his face, \"the boy listened when one of the others said he was once aboard a ship that was becalmed for weeks, and after the food ran out and people began to die you had to determine how much you wanted to live. You had to determine if you could take a blade and carve yourself a meal. and then that man looked at the corpse of the boy\u0027s father, and he held up a knife, and he said, There\u0027s enough meat on the thighs to keep us going. We can drink from him, too. Don\u0027t let it be, that he suffered so much for nothing.\"\n \"and when the knife went to work,\" Slaughter said, \"the boy just sat and watched. He was hungry, you see, and perhaps by then half-mad himself, and the strangest, strangest thing was that, when he ate the first strip of meat when he put it between his teeth, and chewed out all the juice he thought it was better than any dish he\u0027d ever tasted in his life.\"\n \"My God,\" the reverend breathed.\n \"It is like pork,\" Slaughter continued, staring at nothing. \"But sweeter. I\u0027ve been told. I have heard it said-just heard, mind you-that a blindfolded man given a choice of a beef tenderloin, flank of horse and buttock of human being will invariably choose the buttock, it being so richly marbled with fat. and that in the human meat can be tasted the essence of food and drink consumed by that body in happier times. There are some, I hear, who if left to their own devices would become enslaved to the taste of human, and want nothing else. and that\u0027s not mentioning the internal organs, which supposedly have miraculous powers to regenerate the near-dead. Particularly the heart and the brain.\"\n \"Oh!\" he said brightly. \"To finish my story, sirs. When he finally crawled up out of the dark through a space only a desperate boy could have negotiated, and unfortunately but out of necessity left two of his fellow companions behind, he made his way in the course of time to the house of Samuel Dodson, who owned that particular mining company. Thereupon he put a knife to the throats of Master Dodson, his lovely wife and the three little Dodsons and polished them all off, after which the house was burned down around their heads. The end yet just a beginning.\" He finished his cup of cider, held it aloft as a tribute to the hero of his tale, and when Greathouse knocked it from his hand to the floor and James started the pistol-shot barking again Slaughter looked at his oppressor with an expression of dismay.\n \"What, theni\" Slaughter asked. \"You don\u0027t like happy endingsi\"\n Matthew had not eaten all of his stew; there remained a small fatty piece of brown meat at the bottom of the bowl. His stomach being rather queasy, he pushed the bowl away with a finger and sat very still, trying to decide if he was going to keep his food down or not.\n \"Not gonna eat thati\" Tom asked, and when Matthew shook his head the boy reached across the table, took Matthew\u0027s bowl and placed it on the floor as an added treat for James.\n \"Thank you for your confession,\" said Reverend Burton in a raspy voice, his hands folded before him on the table. The knuckles had paled. \"I regret your troubles.\"\n \"Oh, who said it happened to mei I\u0027m just relating a story I heard, from someone I knew a long time ago.\" Slaughter frowned. \"Pastor, what kind of monster would I be if I ate my own fatheri Hmi\"\n \"You\u0027re as mad as a three-legged billygoat,\" Greathouse told him, as the red slowly drained from his face. He rubbed his forehead, as if to dispel as best as he could the gory scene that Slaughter had painted, and then he turned his attention to Burton. \"We appreciate your hospitality. If we can sleep in the barn tonight, we\u0027ll be on our way first thing in the morning.\"\n \"To Fort Laurens.\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"There\u0027s something you ought to know, then,\" Burton said, and Matthew leaned slightly forward because he\u0027d heard something in the old man\u0027s voice that did not bode well. \"Fort Laurens has been deserted for oh many years before New Unity began. a dispute with the Indians, more than thirty years ago, is what they say in Belvedere. a series of raids killed most of the inhabitants and destroyed the fort. Therefore I don\u0027t quite understand why you two are taking a prisoner to Fort Laurens, when nothing\u0027s there but ruins.\"\n Neither Matthew nor Greathouse knew what to say. But Slaughter spoke up: \"They are taking me to Fort Laurens-I should say, to what remains of Fort Laurens-in order to seize money and trinkets that I\u0027ve buried there. The agreement was that, if I take them to this bounty and give it to them, they will let me go. But here\u0027s the thing, sir. I think they\u0027re lying. I think that when they get their hands on the money, they\u0027re either going to keep me in irons or, more likely, they\u0027re going to kill me.\" He paused to let that sink in, as both his escorts were too astonished to speak. \"I see your Bible in the corner, sir. Would you do the godly thing and have these men vow on the Holy Book that they will do what they\u0027ve promisedi\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mister-slaughter-matthew-corbett-3/page-11.html","bookId":2252,"book":{"id":2252,"title":"Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3) \n The world of Colonial America comes vibrantly to life in this masterful new historical thriller by Robert McCammon.
