{"id":86278,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"after a period of profound quiet, during which could be heard the squeaking of the wheels, the jingling of the team\u0027s traces, the battering of a woodpecker against a pine tree and the distant crowing of a delusional rooster, there followed a bray of laughter. Not of the funeral bell variety, but rather of a drunken loon.\\n\\n Matthew had never before heard Greathouse laugh with such rib-splitting abandon. He feared the man would lose his grip not only of the reins but also of his senses, as his face was getting so blood-red, and topple off his seat into the weeds.\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s a good one!\" Greathouse gasped, when at last he\u0027d found his power of speech. His eyes had actually sprung tears. \"a grand try, Slaughter! Now I know why you were in that asylum! You really are insane!\" He was overcome by chortling again, until Matthew thought he might choke on his mirth.\\n\\n Slaughter\u0027s expression remained constant; that is to say, he wore a blank but for slightly-raised eyebrows. \"Sir, I would appreciate your remembering to address me as a gentleman.\"\\n\\n \"all right then, Mister Slaughter!\" Greathouse was barely containing his humor, but a little anger had started to gnaw at the edge of it. \"Do you think we\u0027re a pair of damned foolsi Turn off the pike onto a road to nowherei Christ, save me!\"\\n\\n \"Get your laughter done,\" came the silken response. \"When you can listen with any sense in your ears, let me know. But I\u0027m telling you, the road has a destination, and at its end is a pretty pot of gold.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough.\" Greathouse\u0027s voice was firm, all foolishness over. He flicked the reins once, then again, harder this time, but the horses steadfastly refused to hurry. \"You can tell us all about it when you\u0027re in the gaol.\"\\n\\n \"Now who is the insane one here, siri Why in the name of sixteen fucking devils would I want to tell you about it when I\u0027m in the gaoli The purpose is to tell you about it so that I will not be in the gaol.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you\u0027ll be in the gaol, all right. Just shut up.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Corbetti\" Slaughter\u0027s imploring gaze went to Matthew. \"as I said, I believe you to be the more intelligent of your company. Might I at least explain to you what I\u0027m talking abouti\"\\n\\n \"No!\" said Greathouse.\\n\\n \"Mr. Corbetti\" Slaughter urged. \"The road is coming up soon. Once we pass it and cross the river, neither one of you is going to want to come back, and you\u0027re going to be missing an opportunity that I have never offered anyone on earth and that I would not offer anyone on earth if I wasn\u0027t um just a little anxious about my future.\" He paused to let Matthew consider it. \"May Ii\"\\n\\n \"This ought to be entertaining!\" Greathouse said, with a disdainful puff of air. \"Lies from a madman! Have at it, then!\"\\n\\n Matthew nodded warily, his hand still on the pistol. \"Go ahead.\"\\n\\n \"I thank you. Do you wish to know why constables-armed mercenaries, is a better term for them-were hired by the Quakers to ride along with coaches and to guard travelers on this roadi Because Ratsy and I were so damned successful. We worked the pike between the river and Philadelphia for almost two years, gentlemen. In every kind of weather you can imagine. We were giving the pike a bad name, I suppose. The Quakers were getting nervous about their sterling reputations as upholders of law and order. So they brought out the musketeers, and unfortunately Ratsy went down with a lead ball in his brain, dead before he hit the ground.\"\\n\\n \"Too bad a second shot didn\u0027t \" Greathouse fished for the word. \"Polish you off.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I was shot at, all right. My horse was hit, and he bucked me. I was thrown headlong, knocked senseless, and woke up in chains in the back of a wagon much like this one. I took advantage of a bloody head to cry my case of lunacy, which I knew the Quakers must take into consideration, their being so damned brotherly.\"\\n\\n \"and so the reign of the daring highwaymen had ended,\" said Greathouse with a quick backward glance. \"Pardon me if I don\u0027t shed any tears.\"\\n\\n \"You miss the point, sir. The point being, our great success. The very reason we were considered such a threat to be captured and contained.\" Slaughter looked from the back of Greathouse\u0027s head into Matthew\u0027s eyes. \"We stole a lot of money.\"\\n\\n \"Listen to him drool on!\"\\n\\n \"a lot of money,\" Slaughter repeated. \"at the end of the road you\u0027re going to be passing in about ten minutes is a safebox holding more than fifty pounds.\"\\n\\n Matthew expected Greathouse to laugh again, or to make some rude comment, but he did not.\\n\\n The wheels kept turning.\\n\\n \"and more than the money,\" Slaughter went on, staring fiercely at Matthew. \"Gold rings, jewels in elegant brooches, silver stickpins, and what have you. Two years\u0027 worth of treasure, taken from travelling merchants, dandies and damsels. I\u0027d say in all, a fortune worth well over a hundred pounds. I\u0027m no authority on fancy stones, so it might be much higher. What is a string of pearls selling for these daysi\"\\n\\n \"Drool on,\" Greathouse answered. \"Do you think we\u0027re complete idiotsi\" He flicked the reins once more, hard, as if to gain distance between himself and the prisoner, alas to no avail.\\n\\n \"Mr. Corbetti\" again Slaughter\u0027s brows lifted. \"are you a complete idioti\"\\n\\n Matthew returned the man\u0027s stare. He was trying to read Slaughter\u0027s eyes, his expression, or some giveaway in how he held his head or clenched his hands. He could not; the man was well-sealed.\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027re lying,\" Matthew said.\\n\\n \"Do youi Reallyi Or are you thinking, as your companion probably is, that when I am taken across the river and carried the rest of our journey, am put into the gaol at New York and then aboard a ship to be hanged in London, that the safebox at the end of that road may not be found for dare I say long after you gentlemen are moldering in your gravesi If everi\" Slaughter showed his teeth. \"I can see them now! Those men of the future, turning a shovel on a buried box! and when they open it, and see all that gleaming goodness, just what will they think, Mr. Corbetti What will they thinki That someone in the long ago told a lie, to save their skini Someone trussed in chains, with a pistol held on themi No, they\u0027ll think what complete idiot left this treasure box buried here, and never came back for iti and then their next thought will be: well, now it belongs to us, for the men of the past are dead and gone, and dead men have no need of money.\" He leaned forward slightly, as if to offer a secret. \"But living men need money, don\u0027t theyi Yes, living men need a lot of money, to live well. and that\u0027s no lie.\"\\n\\n Matthew was silent, studying Slaughter\u0027s face. There was not a clue to determine the truth or fiction of his story. \"Tell me this, then,\" he said in a flat, even tone. \"Why were you burying your loot all this distance out here, so far from Philadelphiai\"\\n\\n \"This was not our only refuge. I determined it would be safer to have two places to hide in, and to split the money between. In case one was found, we always had the second. The first is a house in the woods a few miles northwest of the city. There, also, a safebox is buried holding about thirty pounds and some items of jewelry. But I\u0027m not offering that one to you; it\u0027s not part of our accord.\"\\n\\n \"Our accordi\" Greathouse shouted, and for all their age and slowness the horses seemed to jump a foot off the ground.\\n\\n \"This is my offer.\" Slaughter\u0027s voice was quiet and controlled, almost otherworldly in its calm cadence. \"I will lead you to the second house, which is at the end of the road coming up very soon. I will grant you a gift of the safebox, and all its contents. For that, you will unlock my chains and set me free at that location. I\u0027ll take care of myself from there.\"\\n\\n \"am I drunki\" Greathouse asked, speaking to the air. \"Have I caught lunatic\u0027s diseasei\"\\n\\n \"From that point,\" Slaughter continued in the same manner as before, \"I vow before you as a subject of the Queen and a citizen of England that I will take the money from the first safebox and use it to purchase a voyage to \" He paused. \"Where would you like me to goi amsterdami The South Seasi I don\u0027t necessarily like the sun, but-\"\\n\\n \"I am going absolutely mad,\" said Greathouse. \"Hearing disembodied voices.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m done with this country.\" Slaughter was speaking to them both, but staring directly at Matthew. \"Done with England, as well. all I want to do is be gone.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not going to let you go,\" Matthew said. \"That\u0027s the end of it.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but what endi Why not say I was shot while trying to escape, and that my body fell into the riveri Who would ever know differentlyi\"\\n\\n \"We would know.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, dear God!\" Slaughter cast his eyes skyward. \"Have I met a pair of noble imbecilesi Two men out of all creation who have no need for money, and who can live just as well on the sweet but worthless jelly of good deedsi Here! The road\u0027s coming up! See iti\"\\n\\n They did. Curving into the forest on the left was a narrow, rutted track hardly the width of their wagon. The underbrush was wild and the trees thick around as winekegs, their branches and leaves making an interlocked canopy of flaming colors far above.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it!\" Slaughter said. \"Right there, gentlemen. The path to your Sir! You\u0027re not turning!\"\\n\\n Greathouse kept the team going, his shoulders hunched slightly forward.\\n\\n \"More than fifty pounds in money, sir! add together the jewelry and other items and you\u0027ll both be rich men! Can\u0027t you understand what I\u0027m offering youi\" Still the wagon trundled onward. \"I vow I\u0027ll leave the country! What more do you wanti Me to rot behind bars before I swing on the gallows for killing vile creaturesi Do you think the people who sent you here would turn my offer downi Do you think they care about anything but themselvesi\" He gave a harsh, hollow laugh. \"Go on, then! Keep going, right on past, and damn your soul for it, too! Just know you could have been rich, but you were too stupid to claim your prize!\"\\n\\n Matthew looked away from Slaughter\u0027s strained face, which had begun to blotch red during this tirade.\\n\\n The wagon\u0027s wheels made three more revolutions.\\n\\n and then Matthew heard Greathouse say, \"Whoa,\" to the team as if he had a stone in his throat.\\n\\n Greathouse eased back on the reins. The horses stopped.\\n\\n \"What are you doingi\" Matthew asked sharply.\\n\\n Greathouse set the brake. \"I have to piss.\" He put the reins aside, climbed down to the road and walked off into the woods.\\n\\n Slaughter had closed his eyes and leaned his head back again. He said nothing, nor did he move a muscle. Gathering his strength for another try, Matthew suspected.\\n\\n Time passed. a minute or more. Matthew looked toward the woods where Greathouse had gone but couldn\u0027t see him for the thicket. One of the horses rumbled and shifted its weight, as if uneasy at just standing there waiting, and then it joined its brethren in chomping weeds.\\n\\n another minute may have passed before Greathouse reappeared, walking slowly through the brush. He was staring down at the ground, and kicking at stones and acorns. \"Matthew,\" he said without looking up, \"will you come herei\"\\n\\n \"What about-\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not going anywhere.\"\\n\\n Matthew returned his attention to Slaughter, who yet remained motionless.\\n\\n \"Matthew,\" said the prisoner, his eyes closed against the sunlight that lit up his beard like a coalfire. \"a very respectable name, that. Go right ahead, I\u0027ll just rest.\"\\n\\n Matthew got down off the wagon, the pistol in hand. He checked Slaughter\u0027s position once more before he walked the twelve paces or so to join Greathouse, but the prisoner had not moved.\\n\\n \"What is iti\" Matthew asked, seeing the deep furrows of worry that cut across Greathouse\u0027s face. \"Is something wrongi\"\\n\\n Greathouse rummaged in the leaves with the toe of his boot, bent down and picked up a white rock, which he examined closely. \"I want your opinion,\" he said at last, in a restrained voice calculated not to travel the distance of twelve paces. \"Is he lying about the money, or noti\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" The meaning of what Greathouse had just asked him hit Matthew like a timber board across the back of the head. \"Oh, my God! You\u0027re not listening to him, are youi\"\\n\\n \"Keep your voice down.\" Greathouse turned the rock in his hand, examining its cracks and crevices. \"What if he\u0027s not lying, Matthewi I mean why should he, at this stage of the gamei It\u0027s all over for him, and he knows it. Why should he liei\"\\n\\n \"Because he wants to get us down that road and escape, that\u0027s why.\"\\n\\n \"Escape,\" Greathouse repeated. The word had been spoken gravely. \"Howi Chained up like he is, with the ball on his legi and us with the pistoli How the hell is he going to escapei He may be half-crazy, but he\u0027s surely not full-crazy.\" Greathouse continued to turn the white rock in his palm as if studying every possible angle. \"He knows that I won\u0027t kill him, but he also knows he wouldn\u0027t get far with one knee shot off. Hell, I might kill him anyway. I\u0027m not a Quaker, and I didn\u0027t make any damned decree with \u0027em.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s lying,\" said Matthew. \"That\u0027s my opinion, so there it is.\"\\n\\n Greathouse gripped the rock in his fist. \"You don\u0027t think I can handle him, do youi\"\\n\\n \"I think we\u0027re both asking for-\"\\n\\n \"Keep your voice down,\" Greathouse commanded. He stepped forward, until his face was only inches away from Matthew\u0027s. \"I can handle him. I\u0027ve handled plenty like him before-and worse, believe me-so he\u0027s not going to be any problem.\"\\n\\n Matthew shook his head. The intensity of Greathouse\u0027s stare compelled him to fix his own gaze on the dead leaves around their feet.\\n\\n \"Fifty pounds,\" came the quiet voice. \"and more. The gold rings and the jewelry. It would buy Zed\u0027s freedom, Matthew. Don\u0027t you seei\"\\n\\n Matthew did suddenly see, and as he looked into Greathouse\u0027s eyes he felt his face tighten into an incredulous mask. \"That\u0027s what you want the money fori\"\\n\\n \"Yes. What elsei\"\\n\\n Matthew had to take off his tricorn and put the back of his hand against his forehead, for fear his brain had fired up a fever.\\n\\n \"Whatever van Kowenhoven named as a price, we could meet,\" Greathouse went on. \"and pay off Cornbury for the writ of manumission as well. With that much money, we\u0027d probably even have some to spare. You know, to split between us.\"\\n\\n Matthew looked for someplace to sit down, for his legs felt weak. He needed a sturdy boulder to at least lean against, but there was nothing. In his mind was the image of a lockbox disguised as a book, and within it a black leather bag, and within that bag a handful of gleaming gold coins that made him a rich young man.\\n\\n \"Now don\u0027t think I have the slightest intention of letting him go,\" Greathouse said. \"That would be a crime against humanity. But listen, Matthew: we can make him believe we\u0027re in accord, and then when we have the money, it\u0027s right back on this road again, across the river and on to put him behind bars. What do you sayi\"\\n\\n Matthew had no words. He was thinking of the gold coins, and his debts, and new suits in the latest fashion, and how he needed a fireplace for his house, with the winter coming on.\\n\\n \"I know that lying to him might not be to your liking. I understand and appreciate your show of moral character, but back there he said Two men out of all creation who have no need for money. Well, I do have a need for it, and I know you do too.\" Greathouse frowned, taking Matthew\u0027s continued silence as stern disapproval. \"Matthew, we can trick it out of him. We can lie to a liar. Or you don\u0027t have to speak a word, I\u0027ll do all the lying. I have much more experience at it than you.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that,\" Matthew heard himself say, though he had no memory of speaking the words. He had hornets in his head, they were buzzing so loudly he couldn\u0027t hear. This was the moment to tell Greathouse about the gold coins; he knew it was, for if Matthew didn\u0027t tell, Greathouse was going to take them down the forest track in pursuit of Slaughter\u0027s safebox. There was plenty of gold in that leather bag to share. Of course there was. Fifty or more pounds spent for Zed\u0027s freedom, for a bodyguard he didn\u0027t need, and then the rest for all the things Matthew planned on buying. Forget the fireplace until next winter. He had enough clothes, why should he ever need any morei Yes, plenty to share.\\n\\n \"What is it, theni\" Greathouse prodded.\\n\\n Matthew started to speak. To say whati He wasn\u0027t sure. Possibly I am a rich man or It\u0027s not fair, I found the money, me alone, and it\u0027s not fair\\n\\n The world spun about him, and in the air he smelled the faint burned scent of autumn\u0027s decay.\\n\\n Matthew said, with what seemed a genuine labor, \"I am \" and then the rest of it spilled out: \" afraid of him.\"\\n\\n Greathouse grunted, his face screwed up in a scowl. But slowly the scowl eased, Greathouse dropped his white rock and put his hand on Matthew\u0027s shoulder. \"Listen, so am I. a little, maybe. But I\u0027ll take care of everything. Just follow along with me, all righti\"\\n\\n Tell him, he thought. and demanded of himself: Tell him!\\n\\n But he did not, and he stood looking down at all the leaves at his feet as if the earth might open and swallow him up in an instant.\\n\\n \"Come on.\" Greathouse clapped his shoulder. \"Let\u0027s get to it.\"\\n\\n Matthew followed Greathouse to the wagon, where Slaughter still lay with his eyes closed like a beast dozing in the shifting sunbeams. Two more flies had found him and were whirling about his face. Matthew wondered how many he\u0027d dined on since he\u0027d been lying there.\\n\\n Greathouse slammed his palm against the side of the wagon, which caused Slaughter only to lift his eyelids to half-mast and yawn. \"Saying we might believe you,\" Greathouse told him roughly, \"and that we might be interested. How far down that road do we goi\"\\n\\n Slaughter worked his head from side to side, stretching his neck. \"To the end of it, as I\u0027ve already said.\"\\n\\n \"How fari\"\\n\\n \"Oh six miles west, along the river. Then the road takes a turn to the southwest. another four miles, I\u0027d say. Ten miles in all.\"\\n\\n \"Ten milesi That\u0027s a long way, with these horses.\"\\n\\n \"You make a journey,\" said Slaughter, \"with the horses you have.\"\\n\\n Greathouse suddenly reached over and grabbed hold of the prisoner\u0027s beard, which served to secure Slaughter\u0027s full attention. \"If we drive ten miles to the end of that road and no safebox is buried there, I won\u0027t be pleased. Those doctors may have promised the Quakers you\u0027d get to New York alive, but I\u0027m a Baptist. If I decide not to kill you, I\u0027ll at least give you some marks to remember. I may even tear off that damned beard.\" He gave it a steady pull, but Slaughter gave no reaction. \"Do you understand mei Just nod.\"\\n\\n Slaughter did.\\n\\n Greathouse released him. He wiped his hand down the leg of his breeches, leaving a dirty smear. He said to Matthew, \"Get up there and work the horses back.\"\\n\\n Matthew climbed up onto the seat and put the pistol beside him where he could reach it in a hurry if he heard the chains rattle. He lifted the brake, took the reins and started urging the team to backstep as Greathouse took hold of one of the wheels and pushed against it. Soon they had retreated the wagon to just beyond the turnoff. Then Greathouse climbed up again, took the pistol and turned around on the seat to watch Slaughter.\\n\\n \"all right, Matthew,\" said Greathouse. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n Matthew hesitated on the verge of flicking the reins. Tell him, he thought. But it was a quieter, less urgent voice. There was still time. Maybe in the next mile or two. He would have to think about it a little more. and it might not be necessary to tell. Not necessary at all. If the safebox was really there, and it held the treasure as Slaughter said then why would it ever be necessaryi\\n\\n Still, he had a taste of ashes in his mouth, and his fine suit did not seem to hang so well on his frame as it had before.\\n\\n He flicked the reins. The team started walking, one of the horses snorting at this indignity of the driver not knowing whether he was going backward or forward.\\n\\n They entered the woods on the narrow road. The canopy of trees closed above their heads. It was only after another minute or so that Matthew pulled himself out of his thoughts to realize they were heading directly into the oncoming storm. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mister-slaughter-matthew-corbett-3/page-9.html","bookId":2252,"book":{"id":2252,"title":"Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3)","description":"Storyline: Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3) \\n The world of Colonial America comes vibrantly to life in this masterful new historical thriller by Robert McCammon.
