{"id":86272,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\"Very well, then.\" Matthew folded his hands before him on the table. He\u0027d just hung his tricorn on a hook and sat down a moment before, but Greathouse was too taken with consuming his breakfast of eight eggs, four oily and glistening sausages, and six corncakes on a huge dark red platter to have paid him much attention. \"What\u0027s the storyi\" Greathouse paused in his feasting to sip from his cup of tea, which was as hot and as black as could be coaxed from the kitchen of Sally almond\u0027s tavern on Nassau Street. There could be no starker contrast between this esteemed establishment and the vile hole they\u0027d visited last night. Whereas City Hall used to be the center of town, one might say that Sally\u0027s place-a tidy white stone building with a gray slate roof overhung by a huge oak tree-now claimed that position, as the streets and dwellings continued to grow northward. The tavern was warm and friendly and always smelled of mulling spices, smoked meats and freshly-baked pies. The floorboards were kept meticulously swept, vases of fresh flowers stood about, and the large fieldstone fireplace was put to good use at the first autumn chill. For breakfast, the midday meal and supper, Sally almond\u0027s tavern did a brisk business among locals and travelers alike, in so much that Madam almond herself often strolled about strumming a gittern and singing in a light, airy and extremely pleasing voice. Rain had fallen all night, but had ceased near dawn. Through a large window that overlooked the pedestrians, the passing wagons, carts and livestock on Nassau Street could be seen beams of silver sunlight piercing the clouds. Directly across the street was the yellow brick boarding house of Mary Belovaire, where Greathouse was presently living until he found, as he put it, \"more suitable quarters for a bachelor\". His meaning was that Madam Belovaire, though being of a kind spirit, was wont to monitor the comings-and-goings of her lodgers, and go so far as to suggest they regularly attend church services, refrain from cursing and drinking, and generally comport themselves with great decorum as regards the opposite sex. all of which put Greathouse\u0027s large white teeth on the grind. The latest was that Madam Belovaire had been trying to matchmake him with a number of ladies she deemed respectable and upstanding, which in Greathouse\u0027s opinion made them as interesting as a bowlful of calf\u0027s-foot jelly. So it was no wonder that Greathouse had taken to spending some nights working at Number Seven Stone Street, but Matthew knew the man was sleeping on a cot up there in the company of a brandy bottle. But not to say either of them had been bored in the last few weeks. Far from it. Since the Herrald agency had been getting such publicity in the Earwig, there\u0027d been no lack of letters and visitors presenting problems to be solved. Matthew had come to the aid of a young man who\u0027d fallen in love with an Indian girl and wished to prove himself worthy before her father, the chief; there\u0027d been the bizarre and disturbing night ride, in which Matthew had determined that not all the creatures on God\u0027s earth had been created by the hand of God; and there\u0027d been the incident of the game of jingo and the gambler who\u0027d had his prized horse cheated away from him by a gang of cutthroats. For Greathouse\u0027s part, there\u0027d been his ordeal at the House at the Edge of the World that had so nearly cost him his life, and the eerie matter of the last will and testament of Dr. Coffin. as Mrs. Herrald had told Matthew at dinner one night, back in midsummer when she\u0027d offered him a position as a \"problem-solver\" with the agency her husband Richard had founded in London, You can be sure, Matthew, that the criminal element of not only England but also greater Europe is looking in this direction, and has already seen the potential. Whatever it might be: kidnapping, forgery, public and private theft, murder for hire. Domination of the mind and spirit, thereby to gain illicit profit. I could give you a list of the names of individual criminals who will most likely be lured here at some time or another, but it\u0027s not those petty thugs who concern me. It\u0027s the society that thrives underground, that pulls the marionette strings. The very powerful and very deadly group of men-and women-who even now are sitting at dinner just as we are, but they hold carving knives over a map of the new world and their appetites are ravenous. So true, Matthew thought. He\u0027d already come into contact with the man who held the largest knife, and sometimes in dark moments he imagined its blade pressing against his neck. Greathouse put his cup down. He said, \"Zed is a ga.\" Matthew was sure he hadn\u0027t heard correctly. \"a gai\" \"a ga,\" Greathouse answered. His gaze ticked to one side. \"Here\u0027s Evelyn.\" Evelyn Shelton, one of the tavern\u0027s two waitresses, was approaching their table. She had sparkling green eyes and blonde hair like a combed cloud, and as she was also a dancing instructress she was quite nimble on her feet at negotiating the morning crowd. Ivory and copper bracelets clicked and jingled on her wrists. \"Matthew!\" she said with a wide smile. \"What might I get youi\" a new set of ears, he thought, as he still couldn\u0027t comprehend what a \"ga\" was. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. Do you have cracknel todayi\" \"Fresh baked.\" \"You might try the hot sausage,\" Greathouse urged as he chewed into another of the links. \"Tell him how they\u0027ll make a man out of him, Evelyn.\" Her laugh was like the ascending peal of glass bells. \"Oh, they\u0027re spicy all right! But they go down the gullet so fast we can\u0027t keep \u0027em in stock! Only have \u0027em a few days a month as is, so if you want \u0027em you\u0027d best get your order in!\" \"I\u0027ll leave the fiery spice to Mr. Greathouse,\" Matthew decided. \"I\u0027ll have the cracknel, a small bowl of rockahominy, some bacon and cider, thank you.\" He returned his attention across the table when the waitress had gone. \"What exactly is a gai\" \"The Ga tribe. Whew, this is hot!\" He had to blot his forehead with his napkin. \"Damn tasty, though. Zed is a member of the Ga tribe. From the West african coast. I thought he might be, when you first described to me those scars on his face. They\u0027re given to some of the children at a very young age. Those determined to be suitable for training as warriors.\" He drank more tea, but obviously the sausage was compelling for he started immediately in on it again. \"When I saw the scars for myself, the next step was finding out how well Zed could fight. I think he handled the situation very competently, don\u0027t youi\" \"I think you could have been responsible for his death,\" Matthew said grimly. \"and ours, as well.\" \"Shows how much you know. Ga warriors are among the finest hand-to-hand fighters in the world. also, they have a reputation for being fearless. If anything, Zed held himself back last night. He could\u0027ve broken the neck of every man in there and never raised a sweat.\" \"If that\u0027s so,\" Matthew said, \"then why is he a slavei I\u0027d think such a fearless warrior would have resisted the slaver\u0027s rope just a little bit.\" \"ah.\" Greathouse nodded and chewed. \"There you have a good point, which is exactly why I arranged with McCaggers to test him. It\u0027s very rare to find a Ga as a slave. See, McCaggers doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s got. McCaggers wanted the biggest slave he could buy, to move corpses for him. He didn\u0027t know he was buying a fighting machine. But I needed to know just what Zed could do, and it seemed to me that the Cock\u0027a\u0027tail was the place to do it in.\" \"and your reasoning why this fighting machine became a slave, and why he just didn\u0027t fight his way out of his predicamenti\" Greathouse ate a bite of corncake and tapped his fork quietly against the platter. It was of interest to Matthew, as he waited for Greathouse to speak, that Sally almond had bought all her plates and cups in that popular color called \"Indian Blood\" from Hiram Stokely, who\u0027d begun to experiment with different glazes after rebuilding his pottery shop. Due to the rampage of Brutus the bull, the Stokely pottery was now doing twice the business it ever had. \"What put him in his predicament, as you call it,\" Greathouse finally replied, \"will probably always be unknown. But I\u0027d say that even one of the finest warriors in the world might be hit from behind by a cudgel, or trapped in a net and smothered down by six or seven men, or even have to make the choice to sacrifice himself that someone else might escape the chains. His people are fishermen, with a long heritage of seafaring. He might have been caught on a boat, with nowhere to go. I\u0027d say he might have lost his tongue because he wouldn\u0027t give up the fight, and it was explained to him by some tender slaver that another body part would be the next sliced off. all possibilities, but as I say we\u0027ll likely never know.\" \"I\u0027m surprised, then, that he just hasn\u0027t killed McCaggers and run for it.\" \"Now why would he want to do thati\" Greathouse regarded Matthew as if he were looking at an imbecile. \"Where would he goi and what would the point bei From my observation, McCaggers has been kind to him and Zed has responded by being as loyal \" He paused, hunting his compass. \"as loyal as a slave needs to be, given the situation. also, it shows that Zed is intelligent. If he weren\u0027t, I\u0027d have no interest in him. I wouldn\u0027t have paid the money for Benjamin Owles to sew him a decent suit, either.\" \"Whati\" Now this was getting serious. Greathouse had actually paid money for a suiti To be worn by McCaggers\u0027 slavei When he\u0027d righted his senses, Matthew said, \"Would you care to explain-as reasonably and rationally as possible-exactly why you have enough interest in Zed to entertain hiring him for the agencyi Or was I dreaming that part of iti\" \"No, you weren\u0027t dreaming. Here\u0027s your breakfast.\" Evelyn had arrived bearing a tray with Matthew\u0027s food. She also showed an empty burlap bag, marked in red paint Mrs. Sutch\u0027s Sausages and, below that, the legend \u0027Sutch a Pleasure\u0027, to the other patrons in the room. \"all out, kind friends!\" Her announcement brought a chorus of boos and jeers, though in good nature. \"We ought to be getting another shipment next month, which we\u0027ll post on the board outside.\" \"a popular item,\" Matthew remarked as Evelyn put his platter down before him. \"They refuse to believe it\u0027s gone until they see with their own eyes. If this lady didn\u0027t live so far away in Pennsylvania, I think Sally would go into business with her. But, anyway,\" she shrugged, \"it\u0027s all in the spices. anything else I can get for youi\" \"No, this looks fine, thank you.\" When Evelyn retreated again and the hubbub died down, Matthew stared across the table into Greathouse\u0027s eyes as the man continued eating. \"You can\u0027t actually be serious about hiring Zed.\" \"I\u0027m absolutely serious. and as I have the authority from Katherine to make decisions in her absence, I intend to put things into motion right away.\" \"Things into motioni What does that meani\" Greathouse finished all but a last bite of the sausage, which he obviously intended to savor when he\u0027d gone through his corncakes. \"First, the agency has to arrange to buy him from McCaggers.\" \"To buy himi\" \"Yes, that\u0027s what I said. I swear, Matthew! aren\u0027t you getting enough sleepi Don\u0027t things get into your head the first time these daysi\" Greathouse gave a wicked little grin. \"Oh, ho! You\u0027re up late tripping the moonlight with Grigsby\u0027s granddaughter, aren\u0027t youi\" \"absolutely not!\" \"Well, you say one thing and your blush says another.\" \"Berry and I are friends,\" Matthew said, in what he realized was a very tight and careful voice. \"That\u0027s all.\" Greathouse grunted. \"I\u0027d say two people running for their lives together across a vineyard either never want to see each other again or become more than friends. But I\u0027m glad you brought her up.\" \"Mei I didn\u0027t bring her up!\" For emphasis, he crunched his teeth down on a piece of the cracknel. \"She figures in my plan,\" Greathouse said. \"I want to buy Zed from McCaggers, and I want to petition Lord Cornbury for a writ declaring Zed a freed man.\" \"a free-\" Matthew stopped himself, for surely he did feel a bit thick-headed today. \"and I suppose McCaggers will gladly sell you the slave he depends upon to do such a vital worki\" \"I haven\u0027t yet approached McCaggers with this idea. Now bear with me.\" He chewed down the last bite of sausage, and again he reached for the tea. When that didn\u0027t do the trick, he plucked up Matthew\u0027s cider and drank half of it. \"That jingo business you went out on. Walking into that den of thieves, and casting yourself as a foppish gambler. Well, the foppish part was true enough, but you really put yourself in danger there, Matthew, and don\u0027t pretend you didn\u0027t. If I\u0027d known you were accepting a task like that, I\u0027d have gone with you.\" \"You were fully occupied elsewhere,\" Matthew said, referring to the problem of Dr. Coffin that had taken Greathouse across the river to New Jersey. \"and as I interpret the scope of my profession, I am free to accept or reject clients without your approval.\" \"Exactly so. Which is why you need someone to watch your back. I paid McCaggers a fee to allow Zed to dress up in the suit I bought for him and to come to the Cock\u0027a\u0027tail. I told him Zed would be in no danger, which is true when you consider what he can do.\" \"But you didn\u0027t know it was true. He had yet to prove himself.\" Matthew returned to the statement that had caused him to cease crunching his cracknell. \"Someone to watch my backi You mean Zed would be my bodyguardi\" \"Don\u0027t fly off the handle, now. Just listen. Do you know what instructions I asked McCaggers to give Zed last nighti To protect the both of us, and to protect himself. I was ready to reach in if anything went wrong.\" \"Yes,\" Matthew said, with a nod. \"That reach of yours almost got your hand chopped off.\" \"Everybody knows about that axe Skelly keeps behind the bar! I\u0027m not stupid, Matthew!\" \"Neither am I,\" came the calm but heated response. \"Nor do I need a bodyguard. Hasn\u0027t it occurred to you that being in the company of a slave might cause more trouble than simply walking into a place-a den of thieves, as you say-and relying on your wits to resolve the problemi and I appreciate the fact that Zed is fearless. an admirable quality, I\u0027m sure. But sometimes fearless and careless walk hand-in-hand.\" \"Yes, and sometimes smart and stubborn walk ass-in-hand, too!\" said Greathouse. It was hard to tell whether it was anger or sausages flaming his cheeks, but for a few seconds a red glint lingered deep in the man\u0027s eyes; it was the same sort of warning Matthew occasionally saw when they were at rapier practice and Greathouse forgot where he was, placing himself mentally for a dangerous passing moment on the fields of war and the alleyways of intrigue that had both seasoned and scarred him. In those times, Matthew counted himself lucky not to be skewered, for though he was becoming more accomplished at defending his skin he would never be more than an amateur swordsman. Matthew said nothing. He cast his gaze aside and drank some cider, waiting for the older warrior to return from the bloodied corridors. Greathouse worked his knuckles. His fists are already big enough, Matthew thought. \"Katherine has great hopes for you,\" Greathouse said, in a quieter tone of conciliation. \"I absolutely agree that there should be no boundaries on what clients you accept or reject. and certainly, as she told you, this can be a dangerous-and potentially fatal-profession.\" He paused, still working his knuckles. It took him a moment to say what he was really getting at. \"I can\u0027t be with you all the time, and I\u0027d hate for your gravestone to have the year 1702 marked on it.\" \"I don\u0027t need a-\" Matthew abruptly stopped speaking. He felt a darkness coming up around him, like a black cloak here amid these oblivious breakfast patrons of Sally almond\u0027s. He knew this darkness very well. It was a fear that came on him without warning, made his heart beat harder and raised pinpricks of sweat at his temples. It had to do with a small white card marked with a bloody fingerprint. The card was in the writing desk in his home, what used to be the dairyhouse behind Marmaduke Grigsby\u0027s abode. Of this card, which had been delivered to his door by an unknown prowler after his adventure involving the Queen of Bedlam, Matthew had said nothing to any other person. He didn\u0027t wish Berry to know, and certainly not her grandfather with his ready quill and ink-stained fingers. Though Matthew had almost told Greathouse on several occasions he\u0027d decided to close his mouth and shrug the darkness off as best he could. Which at times was a formidable task. The card was a death-threat. No, not a threat. a promise. It was the same type of card that had been delivered to Richard Herrald, Greathouse\u0027s own half-brother, and after seven years the promise came true with his hideous murder. It was the same type of card that had been delivered to Magistrate Nathaniel Powers, whom Matthew had clerked for and who had brought Matthew and Katherine Herrald together. The death promise yet lingered over Powers, who had left New York with his family during the summer and gone to the Carolina colony to help his brother Durham manage Lord Kent\u0027s tobacco plantation. It was a promise of death, this year or next, or the next year or the one after that. When this card was marked with a bloody fingerprint and sent to its victim, there could be no escape from the hand of Professor- \"are you going to eat your rockahominyi\" Greathouse asked. \"It\u0027s lousy when it\u0027s cold.\" Matthew shook his head, and Greathouse took the bowl. after a moment during which the great man nearly cleaned all the rockahominy out of the bowl with four swipes of a spoon, Matthew\u0027s darkness subsided as it always did. His heartbeat returned to normal, the little pricklings of sweat evaporated and he sat calmly, with a blank expression on his face. No one was ever the wiser about how close they might be sitting to a young man who felt a horrific death chasing him down step after step, in a pursuit that might go on for years or might end with a blade to the back on the Broad Way, this very evening. \"Where are youi\" Matthew blinked. Greathouse pushed the bowl aside. \"You went somewhere,\" he said. \"any address that I might knowi\" \"I was thinking about Zed,\" Matthew told him, and managed to make it sound convincing. \"Think all you like,\" came the quick reply, \"but I\u0027ve made the decision. It is absurd for a man of Zed\u0027s talent to be limited to hauling corpses around. I tell you, I\u0027ve seen a lot of slaves but I\u0027ve never seen a Ga in slavery before, and if there\u0027s a chance I can buy him from McCaggers, you can be sure I\u0027m going to make the offer.\" \"and then go about setting him freei\" \"Exactly. as was pointed out last night, it\u0027s against the law for slaves to enter taverns. What good would Zed be to us, if he couldn\u0027t enter where by necessity he might need to goi\" Greathouse began to fish in a pocket for his money. \"Besides, I don\u0027t like the idea of keeping a slave. It\u0027s against my religion. So, since there are several freedmen in New York, including the barber Micah Reynaud, there is a precedent to be followed. Put your money up, I\u0027ll call Evelyn over.\" He raised a hand for the waitress and the bill. \"a precedent, yes,\" Matthew agreed, \"but every slave granted manumission was so approved before Lord Cornbury came. I\u0027m wondering if he can be induced to sign a writ.\" \"First things first. Put your money up. You\u0027re done, aren\u0027t youi\" Matthew\u0027s hesitation spoke volumes, and Greathouse leaned back in his chair with a whuff of exhaled breath. \"Don\u0027t tell me you have no money. again.\" \"I won\u0027t, then.\" Matthew almost shrugged but he decided it would be risking Greathouse\u0027s wrath, which was not pretty. \"I shouldn\u0027t stand for you,\" Greathouse said as Evelyn came to the table. \"This will be the third time in a week.\" He smiled tightly at the waitress as he took the bill, looked it over and paid her the money. \"Thank you, dear,\" he told her. \"Don\u0027t take any wooden duits.\" She gave that little bell-like laugh and went about her business. \"You\u0027re spending too much on your damned clothes,\" Greathouse said, standing up from his chair. \"What\u0027s got your money nowi Those new bootsi\" Matthew also stood up and retrieved his tricorn from its hook. \"I\u0027ve had expenses.\" The boots were to be paid off in four installments. He was half paid on his most recent suit, and still owed money on some shirts from Benjamin Owles. But they were such fine shirts, in chalk white and bird\u0027s-egg blue with frills on the front and cuffs. again, the latest fashion as worn by young men of means. Why should I not have them, he thought, if I wish to make a good impression! \"Your business is your business,\" Greathouse said as they walked through the tavern toward the door. \"Until it starts taking money out of my pocket. I\u0027m keeping count of all this, you know.\" They were nearly at the door when a middle-aged woman with thickly-curled gray hair under a purple hat and an exuberant, sharp-nosed face rose from the table she shared with two other ladies to catch Matthew\u0027s sleeve. \"Oh, Mr. Corbett! a word, please!\" \"Yes, madami\" He knew Mrs. Iris Garrow, wife of Stephen Garrow the Duke Street horn merchant. \"I wanted to ask if you might sign another copy of the Earwig for me, at your conveniencei Sorry to say, Stephen accidentally used the first copy I had to kill a cockroach, and I\u0027ve boxed his ears for it!\" \"I\u0027ll be glad to, madam.\" \"any new adventures to reporti\" breathlessly asked one of the other ladies, anna Whitakker by name and wife to the Dock Ward alderman. \"No,\" Greathouse answered, with enough force to shake the cups of tea on their table. He grasped Matthew\u0027s elbow and pushed him out the door. \"Good morning to you!\" Outside on Nassau Street, in the cool breeze with the silver sunlight beaming down, Matthew reflected that one might be a celebrity one day and the next have cockroach entrails smeared across one\u0027s name. The better to wear nice clothes, hold your head up high and luxuriate in fame, while it lasted. \"There\u0027s one more thing,\" Greathouse told him, stopping before they\u0027d moved very far from Sally almond\u0027s door. \"I wish to know the extent of Zed\u0027s intelligence. How much he can grasp of English, for instance. How quickly he might be taught. You can help me.\" \"Help you howi\" Matthew instantly knew he was going to regret asking. \"You know a teacher,\" Greathouse answered. When Matthew didn\u0027t immediately respond, he prodded: \"Who helps Headmaster Brown at the school.\" Berry Grigsby, of course. Matthew stepped aside to get out of the way of a passing wagon that pulled a buff-colored bull to market. \"I want her opinion. Bring yourself and your lady friend to City Hall at four o\u0027clock. Come up to McCaggers\u0027 attic.\" \"Oh, she\u0027ll love that!\" Matthew could picture Berry up in that attic, where McCaggers kept his skeletons and grisly relics of the coroner\u0027s craft. She\u0027d be out of there like a cannonball shot from a twelve-pounder. \"She doesn\u0027t have to love it, and neither do you. Just be there.\" Greathouse narrowed his eyes and looked north along Nassau. \"I have an errand to run, and it may take me awhile. I presume you have something to do today that doesn\u0027t require the risk of your lifei\" \"I\u0027ll find something.\" There were always the detailed reports of past cases that Matthew was scribing. Once a clerk, always so. \"Four o\u0027clock, then,\" said Greathouse, and began to stride north along the street, against the morning traffic. Matthew watched him go. I have an errand to run. Something was up. Greathouse was on the hunt. Matthew could almost see him sniffing the air. He was in his element, a wolf among sheep. On a case, was hei Who was the clienti If so, he was keeping it a secret from Matthew. Well, so was Matthew keeping a secret. Two secrets, really: the blood card and the amount of debt he was carrying. a third secret, as well. Your lady friend, Greathouse had said. Would that it were more, Matthew thought. But in his situation, in his dangerous profession, with the blood card laid upon him Lady friend would have to do. When he\u0027d watched Greathouse out of sight, Matthew turned south along Nassau. He walked toward Number Seven Stone Street, where he would spend the morning scribing in his journal and from time to time pausing to mark what might have been the faint laughter of distant ghosts.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mister-slaughter-matthew-corbett-3/page-3.html","bookId":2252,"book":{"id":2252,"title":"Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3)","description":"Storyline: Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3) The world of Colonial America comes vibrantly to life in this masterful new historical thriller by Robert McCammon.
