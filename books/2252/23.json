{"id":101000,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"When Matthew awakened, it was as any animal of the forest might: instantly alert, his senses questing, and with the memory of what Walker had just quietly spoken to him.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s coming.\"\\n\\n There was no light but starshine and the poor candle of a quarter-moon. Everything was made up of shades of dark blue deepening to black, and Matthew could just see Walker kneeling at his side.\\n\\n \"One minute,\" Matthew answered, in an equally quiet, composed voice. He opened his shooter\u0027s bag and brought out his powderhorn. In his firearms training, Matthew had been required by Greathouse to several times load a pistol blindfolded. Matthew then thought it had been ridiculous, but now he grasped the wisdom of the exercise. He wished, indeed, that he\u0027d practiced it more, instead of getting out the door and to the coffeehouse as soon as possible. But he would have to do the best he could, and if he made a mistake the gunpowder goblin-he who sometimes flashed bright and hot and sometimes fizzled and sputtered in the hands of greenhorns-would soon correct him most harshly.\\n\\n He shook powder into the pistol\u0027s flashpan, after which he closed the pan\u0027s lid and thumbed the striker to half-cock. Now, he thought as he shouldered his shooter\u0027s bag and stood up to follow Walker, they were in it for blood.\\n\\n Walker unsheathed his bow, took an arrow from his quiver and nocked it. \"Slowly and silently,\" he whispered. \"Stay on my right side, shoulder-to-shoulder. He\u0027s coming in from the left, about sixty yards out.\"\\n\\n \"How do you knowi\"\\n\\n \"I got near enough to hear him. and to smell him. are you readyi\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" He had told bigger lies, but not many.\\n\\n They left the sleeping girl and her mother, crossed the clearing and entered the forest on the far side. Matthew strained to see anything, and thought himself lucky not to immediately trip over a root or stumble into a thicket and fall face-first, alerting everything with ears between here and the City of Brotherly Love. But the moccasins helped his feet read the earth and he moved slowly, at Walker\u0027s pace. One step, and stop. One step, and stop. His heart was beating hard; in this silence, surely Slaughter could hear the drumming.\\n\\n When Matthew took a pace forward and dead leaves crackled, the noise seemed as loud as the raucous laughter of ruffians in the Cock\u0027a\u0027tail tavern. Walker stood motionless, and so did Matthew. They stayed that way for what Matthew thought must have been at least a minute. Walker knelt down, making no noise, and leaned his head further toward the ground. Then, at last, he stood up again and eased onward, correcting their course a few more degrees to the left.\\n\\n Blue upon black and gray upon black were the colors of the night woods. Matthew\u0027s eyes were becoming more accustomed to the dark; here the black stripes of tree branches were faintly seen across dark blue underbrush, and there a gray boulder rose up like an island in a sea of ink. The two stalkers, seeking to intercept the third, continued steathily into the forest. When thorns clutched at Matthew\u0027s buckskin jacket and scratched his face, he barely paused in his advance. His eyes sought movement among the massive trunks of trees and among the black patterns of vegetation. He kept the pistol low at his side, his thumb ready to pull the striker to full-cock. Though the air was chill, sweat rose at his temples and dampened his armpits. He was no hero born with iron nerves; every step he took, he thought he might pee in his breeches.\\n\\n \"Crouch down,\" Walker whispered, close to his ear.\\n\\n He obeyed. Walker got on his knees, tilted his head and leaned forward, almost placing his ear upon the ground. The Indian stayed in that posture as if frozen, while Matthew scanned back and forth across the dark.\\n\\n It was very quiet at first. Just a hint of sound, before it became a sound.\\n\\n Dead leaves being crunched underfoot, almost directly ahead.\\n\\n The sound ceased, so quickly Matthew wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d heard it or not.\\n\\n Walker remained still.\\n\\n The back of Matthew\u0027s neck crawled. If that was indeed Slaughter out there, and not just any noctural animal, he was moving as cautiously as they were. It called to Matthew\u0027s mind the unsettling supposition that Slaughter might have known they would be here, and he was listening for them as well.\\n\\n The noise did not repeat itself. Walker waited a moment more, and then he silently and smoothly rose to his feet.\\n\\n He took one step forward and stopped. Then one step, again, and stopped. His head went from side to side, the arrow ready for a target. Matthew eased up next to him, wincing as a small stick broke under his right heel.\\n\\n Walker once more remained motionless, and Matthew with him. They listened, in the silence.\\n\\n Matthew could only hear his heartbeat and the roaring of blood in his veins. If any of that got any louder, he would be deafened.\\n\\n and now ahead again, but nearer was that the noise of a boot scraping across a stonei Or had it been a pistol\u0027s striker being drawn to full-cocki\\n\\n Walker\u0027s elbow was planted firmly in the center of Matthew\u0027s chest. The message was clear: Wait.\\n\\n Moving his head in small increments, Matthew looked back and forth across the woods. Nothing moved. Nothing made a sound.\\n\\n Then, frighteningly and horribly, there came from the direction of camp a woman\u0027s cry. It was sharp and sudden, and became the noise of Faith calling for her mother. Matthew realized she had awakened in the dark, with all the terror it unlocked in her fragmented mind. In a few seconds the sound of her voice faded, as Faith had either drifted off again or Lark had been able to comfort her.\\n\\n Walker\u0027s elbow moved from Matthew\u0027s chest. Slowly, carefully, Walker took a single step.\\n\\n Something abruptly burst from the brush beneath the Indian\u0027s foot. Matthew, who thought his hair had just turned white, had the sense of a small dark shape scurrying off. Its clatter through the leaves sounded like a herd of deer, though the creature had probably been a rabbit or a woodchuck. Walker stood as solid as a rock, but Matthew was left trembling and instinctively felt at his crotch for any leakage there. Fortunately, he was still wearing dry breeches.\\n\\n But was there a shape ahead of them, through the slanting blue and black bones of the night, that Matthew saw movingi Just a glimpse, and then gone if it had ever been therei\\n\\n \"Something moved,\" Matthew whispered, his voice raw. He started to point and thought better of it. \"ahead to the left.\"\\n\\n Walker aimed his arrow toward that point, and when the Indian took his next step Matthew felt his guts twinge until it was evident there would be no more bursts from the brush. Matthew stayed alongside him, as they advanced among huge trees. In another moment Matthew was aware of a faint and hazy lumination on all sides: the green glow from dozens of mushrooms on the forest floor, or of fungus attached to rotting wood.\\n\\n Matthew kept alert for any further movement. Walker stopped again and seemed to be sniffing the air. There was a long pause, during which Matthew thought his teeth might break, he was clenching them so hard. Walker whispered, with a hint of urgency, \"He\u0027s close.\" a shape suddenly rose from a crouch through the thicket in front of them, but even as Walker let his arrow fly the shape flattened out once more and merged with the dark. There came the thunk of the arrowhead hitting a tree. Walker reached back, took a second arrow from his quiver and nocked it.\\n\\n Matthew saw, to the left again, another fleeting motion. Whether it was part of a shoulder, or a back, or a head, he couldn\u0027t tell. It was just there one instant and the next not. The bowstring sang and the second arrow sped away. No cry of pain followed. There was only the silence and the stillness. Walker readied a third arrow. The Indian moved forward, the bow drawn and the arrow seeking a target. Matthew lifted his pistol and cocked the striker; it made a jarringly loud click. He followed Walker, staying just off his right shoulder.\\n\\n With two more paces, the world blew up.\\n\\n Sparks flew from low down on the ground, about ten feet in front of Walker. In the blinding flash of the powder igniting, Matthew saw Walker fire his third arrow into the light, and then the sound of the gunshot cracked his ears. as Walker staggered back, Matthew pulled his pistol\u0027s trigger and fired into the billowing smoke, his eyes dazzled by first Slaughter\u0027s shot and then his own. another voluminous gout of smoke whirled up, rank with the potent smell of gunpowder, and he felt Walker collide with his shoulder and nearly knock him sprawling.\\n\\n Matthew went down on his knees. Walker had fallen to the ground somewhere behind him. and now, as Matthew\u0027s head reeled and his eyes seemed to pulse with white-hot cores of flame, he realized he had to get his gun loaded again, for there was no way to know if Slaughter had been hit or not. Over the high-pitched ringing in his ears he heard Lark shouting from the camp: \"Matthew! Matthew!\"\\n\\n He got the shooter\u0027s bag off his shoulder and shut his eyes, for they were useless. His fingers would have to see for him. They found the powderhorn, a lead ball and a cloth patch.\\n\\n \"Matthew!\" Lark screamed.\\n\\n He poured the powder, pulled the ramrod from its socket and rammed down the patch and ball. Opened the flashpan. Shook powder into the pan. Closed it. What was he forgettingi Something vital. The ramrod. Still in the barrel. If he lost it, the pistol would be reduced to a club. He removed the ramrod from the barrel and-\\n\\n a shot fired from his right. The ball hissed past his ear. Slaughter might be wounded, but he was still able enough to quick-load a pistol in the dark.\\n\\n Matthew opened his blind eyes, which saw nothing but flowing curtains of light, and fired at the sound of Slaughter\u0027s shot. He heard the ball smack into a treetrunk; he thought, crazily, that Greathouse would have kicked his tail for firing too hastily and too high. Then Matthew\u0027s next thought was that even though Slaughter was also shooting blind he had to move, lest Slaughter pinpoint his own position from the sound. Grabbing the shooter\u0027s bag and holding the pistol like God\u0027s own gift, he got on his belly and crawled to the right over dead leaves, roots and luminous mushrooms.\\n\\n He got his back against a tree and, eyes closed, started the loading process again. Halfway done, he was shaken by the crack of another shot from somewhere in front of him, but where the ball went he didn\u0027t know. all he cared was that he wasn\u0027t hit. Flashpan primedi Ramrod outi Yes. He aimed into the night, pulled the trigger, and the little bastard bullpup gun failed to fire.\\n\\n He thumbed the striker back, his hand trembling. Could be any damned thing gone wrong. Flint misaligned. Touch-hole blocked. Maybe not enough powder in the pan. He opened the pan, feeling his way, and shook more powder into it from the horn.\\n\\n \"Matthew! Matthew, answer me!\" Lark was pleading, near panic. Beyond her voice, he could hear the sound of Faith wailing like a child about to be whipped.\\n\\n He opened his eyes. Through the mist and dazzle he saw a shower of red sparks fly up from the underbrush maybe twenty feet away. He heard the report an instant before the ball knocked splinters from the treetrunk a foot above his head; then it was his turn, and when he pulled the trigger this time the Dovehart Special fired into Slaughter\u0027s hiding-place with a spectacular display of flaming comets and smoke that might have choked London.\\n\\n In the aftermath of the shot, Matthew set to work reloading. His industry was sped by sheer terror, for Slaughter\u0027s last try had been much too close. Was Slaughter woundedi Deadi There was no telling. He got the pistol ready, cocked the striker, and waited for Slaughter\u0027s next move, if the man could move at all.\\n\\n He heard a crashing through the woods. In what direction, it was hard to tell. The smoke was still thick and his eyesight still feeble. Was Slaughter repositioning himself for another attacki Getting around behind himi He almost called out to the man, but for what purposei To tell him to give himself upi He thought that Slaughter might be arrow-pierced and pistol-shot, but as long as the monster had breath, teeth and claws he was not going to surrender. He waited, his heart pounding, the gun aimed into the night, and he would not let himself think about what had happened to Walker. \"Matthew!\" Lark called again, but he was too afraid to answer.\\n\\n a period of time went by-two minutesi threei-during which Matthew thought he might either vomit or pass out. He did neither, but he was hard-pressed to want to move a muscle from where he sat, with the protection of the treetrunk at his back. \"Stand up,\" someone said at last, from the dark. It was Walker\u0027s voice, calm and steady. Matthew didn\u0027t move; he thought he must have been made delirious by the gunpowder fumes, or his ears weren\u0027t quite back to normal. \"Up,\" Walker\u0027s voice repeated. \"He\u0027s gone.\" Matthew was too dazed to respond to the specter; he could see nothing, though thankfully the bright whorls of gunfire had faded away. a hand grasped his left arm. It was solid enough. \"Stand up. He\u0027s gone. Toward the camp.\" The last three words knocked sense into him. He shouldered his shooter\u0027s bag and tried to stand, but everything seemed to be gone from the knees down. \"I thought you were shot,\" Matthew said.\\n\\n \"Listen,\" Walker insisted. \"Do you hear the women anymorei\"\\n\\n Matthew did not. This time his effort at getting to his feet was successful. \"Lark!\" he shouted. There was no answer. Then, again, and louder: \" Lark!\"\\n\\n Slaughter, he thought. Slaughter had crept up to them in the dark, while he was sitting against the tree protecting his back, and cut their throats with razor or knife. \"Lark!\" he cried out, and his voice broke.\\n\\n \"Follow me,\" said Walker.\\n\\n Matthew took hold of Walker\u0027s cloak and stumbled after him. His nostrils felt nearly singed by the scent of the powder, but he caught another odor drifting in the smoky air. He knew what it was: the coppery smell of blood. \"are you hurti\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Walker said, and now his voice had tightened. \"Be silent.\" But just a distance further on, Walker suddenly stopped. \"I\u0027m going to have to rest here.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you hurti\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been shot in the left side. I can feel the edge of a broken rib in the hole. ay-yuh!\" It was an Indian\u0027s exclamation of disgust.\\n\\n \"Sit down. Can youi\"\\n\\n \"I can. But can I get back up againi\"\\n\\n Matthew felt crazed; he feared he was going to crack like an overheated pot, and mad laughter would bubble out. Walker badly injured. Maybe both Lark and her mother lying dead. Was Slaughter waiting for them, hiding among the trees with his pistoli Where was the clearing from herei He thought it was ahead about fifteen yards and maybe another ten or so to the left, but it was through rough thicket.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going in first,\" he decided.\\n\\n \"Go slowly. If the women are dead, there\u0027s nothing you can do. Take a step then stop and listen. and I mean listen, Matthew. He may be hurt, too. If he is, you might hear him breathing. all righti\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"If you hear see or smell anything that makes the flesh on the back of your neck crawl you crouch down and wait. Until you know what it is. However long that takes.\"\\n\\n \"are you trying to teach me how to be an Indiani\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a very good teacher. I was impatient tonight. Too much English in me after all.\" Walker leaned back against a tree, and Matthew saw his shape slide to the ground. \"If you live through the next half hour will you come back for mei\"\\n\\n \"I will,\" Matthew said.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t go anywhere, then.\" He sounded weak and tired, which frightened Matthew almost more than the idea of braving Mister Slaughter\u0027s murderous skills again tonight.\\n\\n But pistol in hand, Matthew turned away from Walker. His mouth set in a grim line, he advanced quietly through the woods, his mind steeled against what he feared to discover. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mister-slaughter-matthew-corbett-3/page-23.html","bookId":2252,"book":{"id":2252,"title":"Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3)","description":"Storyline: Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3) \\n The world of Colonial America comes vibrantly to life in this masterful new historical thriller by Robert McCammon.
