{"id":86293,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"In the brief delay between the flare of the flashpan and the ball leaving the gun, Matthew gripped hold of a broken stub where a branch had been and flattened himself against the trunk. at almost the same time, he was aware of something going past his shoulder on the left side; he heard a high-pitched zip, and his ear tingled in the disturbance of air.\\n\\n The gun cracked. Matthew heard the ball tear through foliage on the other side of the ravine. He looked up to see the shaft of an arrow still vibrating in the meat of Slaughter\u0027s upper right shoulder. Slaughter too was regarding it with an expression of curiosity, the pistol\u0027s smoking barrel uptilted where the arrow\u0027s force had altered his aim.\\n\\n Then Matthew looked over his shoulder to see that Walker had slowly and painfully, inch by inch, angled his body to get a shot. The bow fell from the Indian\u0027s hand. He remained sitting upright, supported by the mass of roots behind him. His eyes were open, unblinking, and now truly focused on something beyond Matthew\u0027s world.\\n\\n Slaughter crashed away through the woods. Matthew was torn for an instant about what to do; he scrambled back across the tree to Walker\u0027s side, and there he found that the last breath had been drawn, the last bit of strength spent, the last measure of will used up.\\n\\n My finest scene was a death sprawl, Walker had said, in which I lay motionless at center stage for three minutes with my eyes open.\\n\\n But the damnable part of it was that Matthew had thought Walker was already dead. Jonathan Redskin the Savage adam the Lucifer of the New World\\n\\n They had all left the stage.\\n\\n Matthew took Walker\u0027s knife. Something came over him that was a resolve greater than courage; he knew he was likely to die today, and possibly in the next few minutes, but it didn\u0027t matter. He was ready for that. His mind shut off to anything and everything but chasing Slaughter down, and he stood up, half-ran and half-jumped along the tree without looking at the bodies below, and then he was in the woods sprinting at full speed along the path Slaughter had just trampled.\\n\\n Beyond the ravine, the land sloped sharply downward. Matthew tore through low-hanging pine branches and flinched as vines whipped his face. His eyes darted back and forth. He jumped a mass of tangled roots, landed off-balance and felt a twinge of pain along his right ankle, but it didn\u0027t slow him a stride. He kept going, and then through the next group of trees he saw Slaughter running on the decline below him, bursting his way through the foliage like any wounded wild beast might.\\n\\n Slaughter ran without a backwards glance. Matthew saw him fumbling with the haversack as he fled. Trying to load the pistol while movingi He didn\u0027t think even a killer of Slaughter\u0027s experience could do that; more likely he was getting everything he needed to hand, and looking for a secure place to stop, pour the powder and ram the ball.\\n\\n Matthew had to get to him first.\\n\\n Pine needles slid under his feet. One slip here and he would be on his face. ahead of him, Slaughter\u0027s foot caught on something and he staggered, nearly falling before he crashed off a birch tree and righted himself. Still they ran downhill, Matthew steadily closing the distance, and then Matthew heard above his own harsh breathing the noise of water rushing over stones.\\n\\n ahead, down at the bottom of this hill where the trees stood thick and colored vivid scarlet, Matthew saw a fast-moving stream. It ran to the left, between rocky banks, and turned the wheel of a watermill, a vine-covered wooden structure with a brown peaked roof. Through the trees Matthew caught the quick glimpse of a village maybe a quarter-mile distant and further below: small houses, white church, smoking chimneys. One of the villages on the outskirts of Philadelphia.\\n\\n Slaughter made for the watermill. This time he dared a glance to judge Matthew\u0027s progress, and with a bound he was up the mill\u0027s three stone steps. He whirled around, facing his pursuer. Matthew saw the powderhorn come out of the bag. Saw Slaughter\u0027s arm moving in a blur to seat the patch and ball. Saw the gleam of the ramrod as it slid from the socket.\\n\\n Matthew felt vines grab at his ankles. He tore free, and was racing toward the steps when he saw the ramrod go down into the barrel.\\n\\n Ramrod out. Powder in the flashpan. Flashpan snapped shut.\\n\\n I\u0027m not going to get there, he thought.\\n\\n Gun swiveling toward him. Thumb on striker.\\n\\n Striker going back.\\n\\n Firing position.\\n\\n The gun was in Matthew\u0027s face, and he saw the striker fall as he was jumping forward up the steps, pushing with every ounce of strength in his legs, the knife in his hand already streaking out.\\n\\n He heard the click of the flint and the hiss of the sparks. Smoke enveloped him, but before the gun fired and the ball came out the pistol was deflected, because Matthew had chopped an arm into Slaughter\u0027s wrist and stabbed at his ribs. But just that fast Slaughter had already sideslipped; he caught Matthew\u0027s arm to prevent the knife from biting, and their backward momentum took them crashing through the door.\\n\\n They tumbled together amid the mill\u0027s inner workings. The rotation of the pit wheel, the wallower and the great spur wheel made a noise like muffled thunder. Matthew and Slaughter fell across a planked floor thick with yellow dust and the decay of thousands of dead leaves blown in through the glassless windows. Matthew had not let go of the knife, and as he rolled away from Slaughter he took it with him. Slaughter got up fast, his face pallid with dust and his eyes full of murder. Matthew saw him swell up and become monstrous, huge of shoulders and chest. The arrow\u0027s shaft had snapped off at the midpoint in their collision, but the way the man moved he seemed to be suffering no sensation of pain.\\n\\n Slaughter flung the pistol end-over-end at Matthew, who dodged aside in time to save his teeth. Slaughter then reached into his haversack. He brought out a wicked-looking knife with a horn handle. Matthew thought it was likely the blade he\u0027d used to sever the rope bridge. a dark brown stain below its handle testified to other work as well.\\n\\n Without hesitation Slaughter rushed Matthew, whipping the knife back and forth. Matthew retreated, striking here and there with the blade but finding only empty air where a body had been. Even wounded, the man possessed a fearsome speed and agility.\\n\\n \"Just lie down, lie down,\" Slaughter breathed, as he circled. \"Lie down, let me kill you, just lie down.\"\\n\\n Matthew had no intention of lying down. But he was still backing away, his own knife ready to stab into Slaughter\u0027s guts if he had to. Slaughter followed, like a man who smells a particularly juicy cut of steak.\\n\\n Slaughter feinted and drew back. He moved to the right, the knife carving slow circles in the air. Slaughter\u0027s eyes never left Matthew\u0027s. There came another feint followed by a fast strike toward Matthew\u0027s chest, which he recognized and dodged almost a second too late. He struck out with his own knife, intending to get under Slaughter\u0027s guard arm as the man righted himself, but then realized with sickening certainty that he was far too slow, for Slaughter\u0027s free hand clamped hard on his wrist. The horn-handled knife rose up. Matthew grasped the arm before it fell. They struggled, slamming back against the wall. a set of shelves collapsed, and with them a box of wooden tools and three or four oak buckets that rolled about the room.\\n\\n as they fought, straining against each other, Slaughter\u0027s dust-streaked face came in toward Matthew\u0027s. Closer, and closer still, until Matthew feared the man would try to bite his nose off. Then Slaughter began to laugh, deeply and slowly, as the increasing pressure from his grip numbed Matthew\u0027s fingers. The ragged fingernails dug into his wrist. Matthew felt the knife began to slip.\\n\\n \"Just a little more, now,\" Slaughter whispered, right up in his face. \"Starting to break, isn\u0027t iti Listen for the bones to snap!\"\\n\\n and then Slaughter twisted Matthew\u0027s wrist so fiercely searing pain coursed along the tortured arm through his neck and paralyzed him. He cried out, equally in panic as well as pain, as the knife fell from his frozen hand to the floor. Slaughter released Matthew\u0027s wrist to jab at his eyes with the fingernails, an effort Matthew was able to deflect even as he clung desperately to Slaughter\u0027s knife arm. Slaughter then grasped the front of Matthew\u0027s buckskin jacket, and with a display of awesome one-handed strength whirled around and flung him across the chamber to crash heavily into the base of the opposite wall.\\n\\n Matthew got up on his knees. He tasted blood. The room swam about him.\\n\\n Slaughter came toward him almost leisurely, the knife at his side. He was hardly breathing heavily. \"Dear Matthew! Don\u0027t you know by nowi It would take two of you to polish me off. alas, there is only-\"\\n\\n One of the wooden buckets was within Matthew\u0027s reach. He picked it up and hurled it at the man\u0027s head.\\n\\n Slaughter dodged, snake-quick, but not quick enough that the bucket didn\u0027t glance off his wounded scalp. Its passage tore the bandage away, brought a hiss from between Slaughter\u0027s teeth and caused blood to stream anew from the hideous, raw red furrow above his ear. \"Damn it!\" he shouted, staggering back and clasping a hand to the injury. How dare you, was his tone of voice. He blinked rapidly; blood was in his eye. \"Damn-\"\\n\\n He never finished the second oath, because Matthew had gotten to his feet and now he hit the man in the mouth as hard as he could. Even falling, Slaughter swung out with the knife; it slashed across Matthew\u0027s chest, carving through buckskin, waistcoat cloth and shirt linen as cleanly as it had cut through the burnt crust of a ham.\\n\\n Slaughter went down on his back, making the planks squeal and tremble. Matthew had no time to worry about a slashed chest. He stomped on the knife hand; once, twice, again did the man have a grip of ironi Slaughter was trying to grab Matthew\u0027s leg, and then he reached up and caught the jacket, but the fingers of his other hand had sprung their knuckles and the knife was loose. Matthew bent down to get it but again Slaughter\u0027s nails came at his face. He kicked at the knife, if only to remove it from the killer\u0027s immediate choices, and the weapon of murderous destruction slid up under one of the revolving wheels.\\n\\n Slaughter was on his knees. The arrow wound was running crimson through his hair. Matthew hit him in the mouth again, but Slaughter just grinned with bloody teeth. a fist struck Matthew in the chest and made his lungs hitch for air, another blow smashed him on the right cheekbone and a third hit his jaw and rocked his head back, and then the killer was up and driving him across the floor toward the mechanisms, where a set of pyramid-shaped teeth in one of the groaning gearwheels could very well scrape a face from a skull.\\n\\n That was Slaughter\u0027s intent. He bent Matthew\u0027s face toward the teeth, put a hand on the back of his head and pushed. Matthew resisted, the cords and muscles of his neck straining. He thrashed to escape, frantically throwing both elbows, but the man\u0027s grip was just too strong. Matthew knew that in another few seconds his fast-dwindling strength would be history, and so too would he be when Slaughter polished him off. Still he fought, and still he knew he was losing. He heard Slaughter grunt when an elbow crashed against his chest, but it was only a matter of time.\\n\\n Matthew felt himself going. Felt himself giving up, whether he wanted to or not. Tryi He had tried. Tried all he could. It was not to be. and all those deaths all for nothing\\n\\n Slaughter released one hand to pound him across the back of the head, which made red comets shoot through his brain. and from the gloom that was closing in on him Matthew imagined that Slaughter leaned forward, as Matthew\u0027s face hung inches over the revolving teeth, and whispered something in his ear that was strangely familiar:\\n\\n \"With a shove and a shriek I pass through the town, and what fast horse might ride me downi\"\\n\\n Very soon, now. Very soon.\\n\\n Try. I\u0027m sorry, he thought. I am all tried out.\\n\\n Something hit the wheel.\\n\\n Not his face. Something that sounded like pebbles. Someone had just thrown a handful of pebbles into the room, is what it sounded like. Matthew heard them-four or five, it might have been-hit the wheel and bounce off; one struck the side of his neck and gave him a sting.\\n\\n all at once Slaughter cast him aside like dirty laundry. Matthew fell to his knees. He stared down at the floor where his own blood was dripping. He was used up, nothing left. He thought he was going to pass out in another few seconds, and lie here like a lamb for the well, yes.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s therei\" he heard Slaughter roar. The man stalked to the nearest window, which looked toward the woods. \"Who\u0027s there, pleasei\" The diplomat at work. \"This is a private matter!\"\\n\\n Matthew saw something roll past his face. His eyes followed it.\\n\\n It was a marble.\\n\\n Green, it appeared to be. No, not altogether green. It had within it a swirl of blue.\\n\\n Matthew was dazed. He had seen that before. Hadn\u0027t hei Somewhere.\\n\\n \"Show yourself!\" Slaughter shouted. He reached into his haversack again-his bottomless bag of horrors, it seemed-and this time brought out the razor, which had an evil glint about it that Matthew had never noted in his own shaving-glass.\\n\\n \"Somebody\u0027s spying on us,\" he heard the man mutter. \"I\u0027ll fix \u0027em, just you wait there. I\u0027ll fix \u0027em.\" and then, louder, \"Come on in! Where are youi\"\\n\\n Matthew didn\u0027t wish to stay for the cutting party. He looked over his shoulder. at one of the windows on the opposite side of the mill.\\n\\n If he was going, it was time to get.\\n\\n Matthew hauled himself up.\\n\\n With the desperate urgency of someone fleeing Satan Incarnate he ran or hobbled or somehow got to the window. as he heard Slaughter bellow and start after him, he flung himself through the frame.\\n\\n For a few seconds he was actually riding on top of the watermill\u0027s wheel, for he had come out amid the blades. Then he was on the downward slope, he banged the right side of his head on a slat, and suddenly he was in cold water that rushed him away from the mill. How deep the stream was he didn\u0027t know, but if his feet dragged the bottom he wasn\u0027t aware of it. The chill of the water had given him a start, but now everything was darkening once more, getting hazy around the edges. He went past several half-submerged rocks that he tried to grasp, but the stream was fast and his reflexes seemed to be several seconds behind his intentions. The stream curved to the right, spun him around in white water eddies and picked up more speed.\\n\\n If Greathouse could see him now, he thought. It was to laugh at, really. To laugh at until one wept. He had the strength of a wet feather. His vision was fading; everything was giving out on him, he had blood in his mouth and a knot on his head and maybe, he thought, this was the end of it. Because his face kept going down into the water, and he couldn\u0027t seem to keep his head up.\\n\\n His chance to get Slaughter was gone. That was to laugh at, as well. Had he ever possessed a chance to \"get\" Slaughteri He doubted it. The man was unstoppable.\\n\\n He was very, very tired. His feet found no bottom. The stream was speeding him along, and now Matthew heard a roaring noise that at any other time might have secured his full attention but that now only made him think his life was numbered in minutes and there was not much to be done about that.\\n\\n There was a waterfall ahead.\\n\\n He let his neck relax, and his face slipped into the water. He felt like a floating bruise. He felt like an utter failure. There was not much to be done about that, either.\\n\\n Oh, but he could try, couldn\u0027t hei\\n\\n No, there would be no more trying. Not today. He just wanted to drift, to some land where there was neither pain of mind nor body.\\n\\n He lifted his face up. The water hissed, rushing past boulders with mossy beards. On either side of the stream was thick forest. He could see a fog ahead; a mist, it was. The waterfall\u0027s spume. He felt a rocky bottom under his feet, which then fell away again. The sound of falling water was louder, and he wondered how steep the drop would be. He might tumble into a deep, swirling pool, or he might come down on more boulders and drown with shattered bones. He hoped it would be quick.\\n\\n I charge you to be my arrow, Walker had said.\\n\\n and Lark speaking: Reach up reach up\\n\\n Matthew saw he was going to pass one of the big rocks, just a few feet to his right. Once beyond that, it was over the falls and done.\\n\\n If he died, he thought, Slaughter would go on and on, truly unstoppable. If he died, then Walker and Lark had offered up their lives for nothing.\\n\\n It was a hard thing to think about. It caused him, in a way, to want to die. To punish himself, maybe, for being so weak.\\n\\n The big rock was coming up, very fast.\\n\\n He began to weep, for Walker and Lark, for her family, for himself too.\\n\\n Because he realized very clearly that his lot in life was not some place beyond pain of mind and body. His lot in life was, in fact, directly in harm\u0027s way. He had asked for that, when he\u0027d signed on with the Herrald agency. and maybe that was the lot in life of all people, and realizing that either broke you or built you. Just as Lark said her father told her: there were only two directions in life, up or down. He was looking at that big rock coming nearer, and as he wept he was thinking that the good thing about tears is sometimes they wash your eyes clear.\\n\\n Slaughter would be along soon, for sure. Looking for him, to finish the job. Matthew thought he maybe had seven or eight minutes. Maybe. But if he only had two minutes, or one minute, he ought to get out of this stream and not let a waterfall break Walker\u0027s arrow.\\n\\n The big rock was right there.\\n\\n Painfully, Matthew kicked toward it, and he reached up.\\n\\n It took him a long time to get out. Seven minutesi Teni He had no idea. He was hurt and hurting, no doubt about it. Spitting blood from a cut inside his mouth where his own teeth had bitten flesh, his head throbbing, his vision fading in and out, the muscles of his legs stiff and cramping, his neck nearly wrenched. But he got out by swimming from one big rock to the next, grabbing hold of the mossy beards and pulling himself onward, until at last he could stand up and hobble into the woods.\\n\\n He staggered like a drunk through the dense thicket, lost his footing almost at once and slid into a hollow full of vines and fallen leaves. There he lay on his back, the world slowly spinning around him. He hoped that if Slaughter followed the stream he might think the waterfall had done his work for him; still, Matthew knew he was not safe, that he ought to get up and keep moving, but he could not. He forced himself to turn over, get up on his knees and start digging into the leaves, winnowing himself in like a wounded mole.\\n\\n It was while he was occupied at this camouflage that he heard the voice through the woods.\\n\\n \"all right, come out! Do you heari\"\\n\\n Matthew\u0027s heart nearly burst. He flattened his body and pressed into the leaves. The smell of dirt and decay was up his nostrils. He stopped breathing.\\n\\n \"What kind of game are you playing ati\" Slaughter shouted. \"Can\u0027t you see I\u0027m hurt, I don\u0027t have time for this!\"\\n\\n Matthew didn\u0027t move.\\n\\n \"You have the wrong impression!\" Slaughter went on. His voice was moving. \"I was attacked! That thief tried to kill me!\"\\n\\n Matthew heard him crunching through leaves alongside the stream. He\u0027s not speaking to me, Matthew realized. He\u0027s speaking to whoever threw the pebbles. Not pebbles marbles. But whoi\\n\\n \"Come out, let\u0027s talk about this!\"\\n\\n Matthew knew that the razor would do most of the talking. Slaughter was silent; he\u0027d continued on, away from Matthew\u0027s hiding-place. Had he looked over the fallsi Seen anything that might lead him to believe a certain constable from New York was deader than yesterday\u0027s codfish piei\\n\\n Matthew could breathe again, but he still didn\u0027t move. He didn\u0027t think he could move, even if he wished. He was safe here, buried in all these leaves. at least he had the illusion of safety, and that was all he could ask for.\\n\\n \"all right, then!\" he heard Slaughter shout, some distance away. The voice was ragged and tired; the beast was also in pain. \"as you please!\"\\n\\n Then, nothing more.\\n\\n Matthew thought of calling for help to whoever had thrown the pebbles-marbles-but the thought was short-lived. Slaughter might still be near enough to hear. What would Slaughter do nexti Matthew wondered. His mind was sluggish, filling up with dark mud. What would any man with an arrow in his shoulder and a bloody gash across his scalp doi Find a doctor while he could still stand up. He would go down to that village-Caulder\u0027s Crossing or whatever it was-and find a doctor to mend him.\\n\\n Matthew decided he should rest here for awhile. a short while. Slaughter wasn\u0027t going anywhere fast. Matthew needed some rest. He needed some strength. He would let himself rest here until he was sure he could walk again without falling, he thought. Then he would get up, and he would go down in search of the doctor. No better to find the town\u0027s constable first. Tell him to bring a gun or two, or three. also bring about five more men.\\n\\n I\u0027m not done, Matthew thought. Not finished.\\n\\n His eyes were closed, though he hadn\u0027t remembered closing them.\\n\\n He did not drift off; he plunged into an abyss.\\n\\n When his eyes opened again, the light had faded to purple. He had no idea at first where he was, or why. Night is coming on, he thought. Why am I buried, and in whati Everything suddenly came back in a jumble and rush, a madman\u0027s picture book. He had to get up now, he told himself. Slaughter was down in the village, wherever that was from here. Get up, get up!\\n\\n Matthew moved, but the pain that throbbed through him-from arms, legs, scalp, cheekbone, chest, everywhere it seemed-put quit to that intention. He felt as if his bones had been yanked from their sockets and thrust back in at crooked angles. He might have groaned, he didn\u0027t know. Some small frightened animal darted away. Slowly, against every bruise that shouted his name, he started digging out of the leaves. His head ached fiercely, and it seemed to take tremendous effort and concentration to do anything. He was the one who needed the doctor, he thought. Maybe later, after Slaughter was behind bars.\\n\\n Get up, get up! Now!\\n\\n He tried. His feet slipped out from under him. He rolled down into underbrush and stickers.\\n\\n The purple light darkened. Matthew felt the chill of the night around him, but the earth was warm.\\n\\n He would try again in a little while, he thought. Not yet. He wasn\u0027t strong enough yet. But he wasn\u0027t done, he told himself. He wasn\u0027t finished. Neither would he give up, no matter what. He would just keep on trying.\\n\\n and that was something, wasn\u0027t iti \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mister-slaughter-matthew-corbett-3/page-25.html","bookId":2252,"book":{"id":2252,"title":"Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3)","description":"Storyline: Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3) \\n The world of Colonial America comes vibrantly to life in this masterful new historical thriller by Robert McCammon.
