{"id":86285,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"In fact,\" Walker continued, as Matthew\u0027s heart seemed to cease beating, \"your friend has died twice. Both times the medicine sisters have been able to sing his soul into returning to his body, but they think it would understand better if you were to speak to it in your own language. They say he\u0027s a very strong man, though, which is a good thing. Go with Old Dry ashes, he\u0027ll take you there.\" Matthew passed by Walker, who withdrew with the watch clasped in his hand, and went out into the gray light. Old Dry ashes turned and began walking at a brisk pace that challenged the ability of Matthew\u0027s aching legs. again a group of children followed along, chattering and laughing at the pale, wobbling scarecrow, while their dogs ran around in circles and every so often aimed an indignant bark in Matthew\u0027s direction. The journey this time was mercifully short. Old Dry ashes led Matthew to a structure that was twice as large as Walker\u0027s dwelling. It also was emitting smoke from a hole at the center of its roof, and its walls were covered with deerskins marked with red, blue and yellow designs that appeared, to Matthew\u0027s limited comprehension, to be stick-figure depictions of human beings, animals and fantastic shapes with multiple arms, legs and eyes that might represent denizens of the spirit world. He thought this place, the domain of the medicine sisters, must be the village\u0027s hospital, if indeed any connection could be made to the English world. Strips of leather decorated with feathers, beads and carved totems marked the entry, and set above it-ominously so-was a human skull missing its lower jaw, perhaps to mark the fact that the medicine sisters lost patients just as did doctors in New York, and they wished not to be spoken badly of by the departed in their afterlife. Or, that bones were only bones, and all flesh no matter how proud, how beautiful, or how strong, was destined to fail. Old Dry ashes stopped before the entry and motioned Matthew in. With the most mixed emotions of dread and propensity he\u0027d ever experienced, Matthew parted the leather curtains and went inside. Once more the dimness of light within at first limited his vision. Then, gradually, he made out the figures of two women, both of sturdy size, with long silver hair and dressed in deerskins decorated with beads, brightly-hued feathers, and totems. Their faces were painted, one yellow with red around the eyes, the second half-blue and half-green. They both held round wooden rattles with, presumably, dried beans or corn inside. an essence of some kind had been applied to the central firepit, for the crackling flames showed colors of blue and purple. The sweet, musky smell of burning spices was all but overpowering. Clay pots and jars stood about, in a variety of sizes. and hanging in what appeared to be a hammock sewn from beaverskins was a figure tightly wrapped in white cloth, like a babe in swaddling. Only Greathouse\u0027s head was visible. His eyes were closed, his sweat-damp face gray except for daubs of red and yellow that had been applied to chin and forehead. The two medicine sisters were keening and chanting in low voices as Matthew approached, and did not pause in their vocal utterings to the spirits when Matthew stepped between them. Matthew thought Greathouse looked eighty years old. It seemed that the flesh was starting to tighten around the skull. Matthew felt a start of alarm because he couldn\u0027t tell if Greathouse was breathing or not. Then one of the medicine sisters took a drink from liquid in a red cup, sprayed it between her teeth onto Greathouse\u0027s face, and Matthew saw him flinch, if almost imperceptibly. \"Hudson,\" Matthew said, as the medicine sisters chanted and shook their rattles through the musky-scented smoke. Greathouse\u0027s eyes fluttered and opened. Blood-shot and dark-hollowed, they searched for a face to go with the voice. \"I\u0027m here,\" Matthew said, and touched the man\u0027s swaddled shoulder. \"Matthewi\" It was a weary whisper; the voice of a man who was saving his strength to fight for his life. \"Yes.\" \"Where the hell are wei\" \"an Indian village. Not far from Fort Laurens.\" Greathouse made a noise of either pain or interest, it was hard to tell which. \"How\u0027d we get herei\" \"They brought us.\" \"I can\u0027t move.\" He frowned, obviously disturbed by his lack of freedom. \"Why can\u0027t I movei\" \"You\u0027re all wrapped up. Don\u0027t try to move. I imagine they\u0027ve put something on your wounds, and you don\u0027t want to-\" \"Shit, what a mess,\" Greathouse said, squeezing his eyes shut again. \"That box. Damned box. What was in iti\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" There was a long moment in which Greathouse didn\u0027t speak. Matthew was aware that the medicine sisters had withdrawn to the other side of their shelter, probably to give him the opportunity to convince Greathouse\u0027s spirit not to fly away from the body. \"Well,\" Greathouse whispered, his eyes opening again, \"I was a prince of fools wasn\u0027t Ii\" \"How could you have knowni\" a small tide of anger rippled over the man\u0027s face. \"I am paid to know. It\u0027s my job.\" He winced as fresh pain hit him, and let the anger go in order to lessen his torment. \"In the well. I remember that. You wouldn\u0027t let me go under.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" Matthew said. \"I\u0027m not going to let you go under here, either. I forbid you to die.\" \"Oh do youi\" \"Yes, I do. I forbid you to die because my education is not yet complete, and when you\u0027re up on your feet again and we\u0027re back in New York I intend to continue my lessons in sword-fighting and, as you put it, the art of combat. So you\u0027re not to die, do you hear mei\" Greathouse gave a grunt that might have been a muffled laugh. \"Who died,\" he said, \"and made you kingi\" \"I\u0027m just telling you, as your associate.\" It was a difficult task for Matthew to keep his voice steady. \"I see.\" again, Greathouse was silent for awhile. His eyes closed, the eyelids fluttered, and then he brought himself up to the world once more. \"I suppose if the young master Matthew Corbett commands it, then I\u0027ll have to obey.\" \"You\u0027ve been through worse than this,\" Matthew said. \"I\u0027ve seen the scars.\" \"My collection\u0027s growing. Like it or not.\" Matthew tore his gaze away from Greathouse\u0027s face and stared at the ground. The fire popped and hissed behind him. He knew what he had to do now; he knew this was the moment. He opened his mouth to speak. \"Listen,\" Greathouse whispered. When Matthew looked at him again, he saw that Greathouse wore the crooked hint of a smile. \"Something amusing. The work I was doing. For Lillehorne. Hired me to find out if his wife, the Princess is having \" Once more he hesitated, and winced at a passing thrust of pain. \"Sexual relations with the new doctor in town.\" \"Dr. Malloryi\" \"Yes. Him.\" Matthew knew that Jason Mallory and his wife Rebecca had come to New York from Boston about a month ago, and set up residence at the north end of Nassau Street. Mallory was in his late thirties and as handsome as his black-haired wife was beautiful. He doubted that the good doctor would wish to dally with the needle-nosed, frankly unattractive Maude Lillehorne when his own lady was so comely. \"Told me Princess sees him three times a week,\" Greathouse went on. \"Says she comes home in a sweat. Red-faced, and trembly. Can you imagine iti\" \"No, I can\u0027t.\" \"Won\u0027t tell Lillehorne why she goes. Just that that she needs him.\" a savage little grin moved across Greathouse\u0027s mouth, which Matthew took to be a good sign. \"and listen the thing is \" He couldn\u0027t speak for awhile, until he\u0027d recovered some strength and breath. \"There are four other wives. Seeing Mallory. For unknown reasons. He must be hell of a ram.\" Greathouse shook his head, as much as he was able. \"Me I\u0027d like to ram his wife.\" Greathouse then lapsed into silence, and the grin slowly faded. His eyes closed and Matthew thought he\u0027d drifted to sleep, but then he said in a barely audible voice, \"God, I\u0027m tired.\" \"You\u0027re going to be all right,\" Matthew told him. \"It\u0027ll take time, but at least you\u0027ll have another interesting story to tell.\" and then he leaned closer to Greathouse\u0027s ear, and he said, \"I\u0027m to blame for this.\" Greathouse said, \"Whati\" His eyes were still shut, his mouth slack. \"I\u0027ve caused all this. I wanted to tell you, but I was afraid.\" \"afraidi Of whati\" The voice was almost gone. \"Of what you\u0027d think of me.\" Matthew\u0027s heart was beating harder; even with Greathouse in this condition, it was difficult to get the words out. \"I\u0027ve deceived you. When I went to the Chapel estate that day I found the tunnel I also found some money.\" \"Money,\" Greathouse whispered. \"Eighty pounds worth of gold coins, hidden in a lockbox made to pass as a book. The money is in my house, right now. It\u0027s enough more than enough to buy Zed\u0027s freedom. I didn\u0027t tell you, because \" The moment of truth had at long last arrived, and its fruit tasted bitter indeed. \"Because I wanted all of it,\" he went on, his face as agonized as Greathouse\u0027s now was peaceful. \"I found it, and I thought it should be mine. Every last penny of it. When we turned off the pike, I should have told you. I wanted to, but I thought, maybe we could get Slaughter\u0027s money. I thought we could trick him as you said, and everything would be all right. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Matthew said, \"that you have to pay for my mistake. I\u0027m sorry that I didn\u0027t tell you. But listen to me, Hudson. I\u0027m going after Slaughter, and I\u0027m going to bring him back. Before God, I can\u0027t live knowing what I\u0027ve let loose. Can you hear me, Hudsoni\" He clasped his friend\u0027s shoulder more tightly. \"Can you heari\" \"I hear,\" said another voice. Matthew turned around. Behind him and just to one side stood Walker In Two Worlds. They stared at each other for a moment, as the fire crackled and blue flames curled. Walker held up his right hand, in which was gripped the silver watch. \"I like this.\" His eyes were full of shadow. \"I\u0027m sure it was very expensive, in your land.\" He stepped forward and put the fingers of his left hand under Greathouse\u0027s nostrils. \"Still alive. I think he must be a very strong man.\" \"Do they think he\u0027ll livei\" Matthew motioned with a lift of his chin toward the two women, who stood watching from the far wall. Walker spoke to them, and one answered. \"She says it\u0027s too early to tell, but it\u0027s a good sign that his soul has decided to stay in his body, at least for now.\" He looked down upon Greathouse\u0027s placid face. \"Sleeping well, it seems to me. They gave him some strong medicine. He shouldn\u0027t wake again before tomorrow.\" \"Can they give me somethingi\" Matthew asked. \"For my hands and feet. Maybe also to keep me going.\" \"They do medicine, not \" Walker probed his memory for the right word. \"Miracles,\" he said. \"You need food and sleep.\" He spoke once more to the women, and was answered again by the same one. \"She says they can put a poultice on your hands and feet and bind them up, yes, but it won\u0027t take away all the pain.\" \"Just so I can walk.\" \"You won\u0027t be doing any walking today. Better to let them work on you, and rest until morning.\" He nodded toward Greathouse. \"Is this man your brotheri\" \"In a manner of speaking,\" Matthew replied, \"I\u0027d say he is.\" \"But you betrayed himi and now you seek to make things righti\" Matthew didn\u0027t know how much of his confession Walker had heard, but obviously the Indian had caught some of it. \"Yes.\" \"and the man called Slaughteri If I refuse to track him for you, will you still goi\" \"I will. He\u0027s going to have a long headstart, but he has no shoes. The first thing he\u0027s going to do is try to get a pair of boots.\" Matthew had already given this some thought. Would Slaughter try to get the wagon backed up on the road above Fort Laurensi It would be a hard job for one man. He might try to unharness the horses, but those old nags weren\u0027t going to hold a rider. Matthew recalled, with chilling clarity, Slaughter\u0027s comment to Reverend Burton: Looks to me as if we\u0027d wear near the same size of boots. You wouldn\u0027t have another pair, would youi Matthew thought that was going to be Slaughter\u0027s first destination, but where he would go after that was anyone\u0027s guess. Matthew could only hope that Slaughter took just the boots, and left Burton and Tom in one piece. \"You may never find him,\" Walker said. \"You know that, don\u0027t youi\" \"I know I\u0027ll never find him if I don\u0027t try.\" Walker stared into Matthew\u0027s eyes for a time, until Matthew uncomfortably felt as if the Indian was gauging the territory of his very soul. \"True enough,\" said Walker. He spoke to the medicine sisters, who acknowledged him by going about business that involved pouring some of the contents-different kinds of tree bark and berries, it appeared to Matthew-from a few of the jars out into a bowl and then grinding the mixture with a pestle made from an animal\u0027s bone. \"Do you like fishi\" Walker asked, and when Matthew nodded he said, \"Come on then, there\u0027s always some on the coals at \" He paused as he put together the correct translation. \"Happy River Turtle\u0027s house.\" as they progressed through the village, Matthew noted that most gave Walker a wide berth, and some averted their faces or clasped their hands over nose or mouth as if to avoid a bad smell. Women picked up children at their approach, and hurried away. a few braves motioned angrily at them, their attention directed specifically to Walker, but Walker paid no heed to his critics and actually laughed harshly in the face of one who came up close enough to spray them with spittle. \"Don\u0027t mind them,\" Walker explained. \"This is a show they put on.\" Matthew had to ask the question, though he didn\u0027t know how to phrase it. So he simply asked it as best he could: \"How are you insanei\" Walker looked at the watch as they continued on, and rubbed its silver back with his palm. \"I know too much,\" he answered. Happy River Turtle indeed must have a fine reputation as a cook, Matthew thought, for there was a crowd around the longhouse he and Walker were approaching. There was an outside fire burning at the center of a communal eating area. It was almost a festive atmosphere, of people drinking from clay cups and hollowed-out gourds and taking from the fire roasted meat and fish on sharpened sticks. It shouldn\u0027t have surprised him, he mused, because it was time for the midday meal here just as in New York. He didn\u0027t see that any payment was being made for the culinary items, but maybe it was simply on the basis of share-and-share-alike, or that some system of bartering was happening beyond Matthew\u0027s understanding. In any case, Walker waded into the throng-which parted for him, and became more sullen until he had passed through-and then returned bearing a stick on which sizzled large chunks of charred white-fleshed fish along with pieces of tomato and peppers. Matthew reasoned they were to share the item, so there was enough to go around. Matthew sat on the ground to eat the portion that Walker gave him, for his legs were giving out. He felt exhaustion coming upon him, slowly and steadily; it was a process he could not halt, no matter how steadfast his will. as he ate, he couldn\u0027t help but go over in his mind again and again the events of the morning. When he could tear his thoughts away from Greathouse\u0027s precarious situation and his concerns about Reverend Burton and Tom, he found himself pondering the trick safebox. How had Slaughter managed to rig such a thingi Some kind of explosive device had been concealed in it, yes, but how had the thing workedi and all the time Slaughter had been pretending to fear for his life he\u0027d known that box was in its hole, protected from the damp by all the straw, ready to go off in Greathouse\u0027s face. Had Slaughter primed the thing over two years ago, and left it waiting like a bombi But for what reasoni His fear that Indians might dig it upi Slaughter couldn\u0027t have known he wouldn\u0027t be back to his cabin that day he was captured, so perhaps the box was primed to go off when and if an Indian tried to open it. But what had been inside to make it explodei Matthew wished he could get a look at it, just to satisfy his curiosity. His hands were stiffening up. He finished his food, grateful to get something in his stomach, and then struggled to his feet again. Walker remained a few yards away, crouched on his haunches as he ate. No one had dared to come anywhere near either of them. Matthew watched Walker as the Indian stared out impassively toward the other villagers. Insanei Because he knew too muchi Matthew noted that Walker kept firm hold of the watch, and gazed at it every so often. In admiration, or for some other reasoni It was hard to tell. Equally hard to tell was whether Walker had decided to help him or not. If not, then Matthew was on his own, but he had to keep going. Tomorrow morning he would set out, no matter what. First to the reverend\u0027s house, and theni He wasn\u0027t sure. Would Slaughter head back for the Philadelphia Pike, or toward the nearest settlement, which would be the trading post at Belvederei It seemed to Matthew that once Slaughter got boots on his feet his next item he\u0027d try to get was a horse that could carry him at a reasonable speed. If that happened, the chance of catching up with him became even less likely. Matthew felt that if he closed his eyes for just a second and reopened them, all this might fade away and reveal itself to be nought but a bad dream brought on by the experience-long ago, it seemed now-at the Cock\u0027a\u0027tail tavern. Here stands the celebrity of New York! he thought bitterly. Look how well he\u0027s dressed, and how fine a figure he makes! He lowered his head. all that could go to Hell, he thought. The only thing that was important now-the only thing that both taunted and compelled him-was seeing Tyranthus Slaughter back in chains. He was aware of a movement to his left. When he looked up, the young Indian girl who was holding a wooden cup full of water instinctively stepped back, like a frightened doe. But she only retreated one pace, and then held her ground because, after all, it was her ground. Her dark eyes shone as if pools of some exotic amalgam of ebony and silver. Her long black hair was a midnight stream, flowing over the warm brown stones of her shoulders. In her lovely, full-lipped face and steady gaze Matthew saw something ancient and indescribable, as if the hundreds of ancestors who had hunted and farmed this land, had raised children here, had died and returned to the earth, were there behind her eyes, studying him. She was maybe fifteen or sixteen years old, but timeless. She wore the deerskins, beads and ornaments her mother had worn, and her mother\u0027s mother, and on back into the mists before London\u0027s first citizen had built a fire on the edge of the Thames. He felt flowing out from her like a spirit force the dignity of great age, but also the curiosity of a child who never aged. She said something softly, like a church bell heard at a great distance. Then she came forward and offered him the cup, and he took it and soothed his thirst. Step by step she backed away, calmly watching him, until at last she turned around and was gone among her people. \"Matthew Corbett,\" said Walker In Two Worlds, standing at his side. \"Come with me now.\" In his state of increasing weariness, his mind beginning to fill up with fog, Matthew followed Walker back to the house of the medicine sisters. Within, the two women were prepared for him. They washed his hands with warm water from a pot over the fire, dried them and applied a red powder to his raw palms that made him grit his teeth and almost shout from the pain, but he was determined not to make a fool of himself. Next they coated his palms with a brown, sticky liquid that smelled of pine sap, and was as cooling as the pain had been hot. Pieces of white cloth were bound around his hands, followed by strips of leather that were knotted and secured so that he in essence found himself wearing fingerless gloves. The sisters were chattering at him, wanting him to do something he couldn\u0027t understand, and Walker had not entered the dwelling with him so he was all at sea. Then one of the women overturned a large wooden pot in a corner and plopped herself down on it, motioning Matthew to follow her example. as he sat on the makeshift chair, the medicine sisters removed his-Greathouse\u0027s-boots and treated his damaged feet in the same fashion, with powder and pine sap liquid. Then they repeated the process of the pieces of cloth and also the binding of his feet with the leather strips, knotted and secured across the top of the foot. He started to stand up but they grasped his shoulders and wouldn\u0027t allow it. a nasty-looking black elixir was poured from a long-necked clay jar into a fist-sized cup and put to his mouth. He had no choice but to drink it, and though it smelled like wet dirt it tasted surprisingly sweet, like musky fermented grapes or berries. They wouldn\u0027t let him stop until he\u0027d finished it all, after which he was light-headed and his tongue felt coated with fur. at the bottom of the cup was a residue of what appeared to be pure black river mud. \"Here,\" said Walker, as he came into the house. \"These should fit you.\" He held out for Matthew a pair of moccasins. They were by no means new, but looked to be sturdy enough. Matthew took them and tried them on. They did fit, quite comfortably. \"Sleep in those tonight,\" Walker told him. \"Get used to them. Those English boots aren\u0027t any good for travelling.\" \"Thank you. Where will I sleepi\" \"Outside my house, on the ground. I\u0027ll give you a blanket. You ought to get used to sleeping on the ground, too. Besides,\" he said, \"my demons come in the night.\" Matthew nodded, deciding it was far better to sleep on the ground than witness a visitation of Walker\u0027s demons, whatever they were. \"We\u0027ll eat well tonight,\" Walker continued. \"But you\u0027ll be wanting to sleep early, with all that \" He hesitated. \"There\u0027s no English word for what you just drank, but the sisters know what they\u0027re doing. We\u0027ll leave at dawn, and we\u0027ll be travelling light and fast. That is, as fast as you can move.\" \"Wei\" \"You\u0027ll never find that man by yourself,\" Walker said. \"I told you I liked the watch.\" He was still holding it, Matthew saw. \"all right.\" Either the drink was about to overpower him, or it was the sense of relief. \"I thank you again.\" \"Thank me after he\u0027s caught. Which, as you English would say, is tomorrow\u0027s business.\" Matthew stood up in his new footwear. He approached the beaverskin hammock where Greathouse lay silent, eyes closed, in his wrapping. He remembered something Greathouse had spoken to him, that morning at Sally almond\u0027s. I can\u0027t be with you all the time, and I\u0027d hate for your gravestone to have the year 1702 marked on it. \"I as well,\" Matthew said quietly. But it was equally important-vitally important-to stop Slaughter from filling up any more graves. He prayed he would be in time, and that when the time came he would be strong enough-and smart enough, having crawled back from that deepest pit in Hell set aside for men who think themselves so very smart-to be more than a match for a monster. But, as the Indian and the English said, that was tomorrow\u0027s business.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mister-slaughter-matthew-corbett-3/page-16.html","bookId":2252,"book":{"id":2252,"title":"Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3)","description":"Storyline: Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett #3) The world of Colonial America comes vibrantly to life in this masterful new historical thriller by Robert McCammon.
