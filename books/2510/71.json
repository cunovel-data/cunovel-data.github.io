Pay no attention to anything I say, but that I love you, have always loved you.\n I must end this before I become maudlin. It would not do for me to attend the reception for the King of Aragon in a distraught humor. It is times like these when I wish I had not lost the ability to weep, for tears might cleanse me. But red and swollen eyes will not become me, so I will tell myself that I was fortunate when the change deprived me of weeping, and my soul will mourn. Doubtless someone will provide me a distraction, and, who knowsâ€”I may find someone who will want to share my pleasures.\n And you, my dearest, have you found someone to share your pleasures, or are you still alone? If there were anything I might do to give you that which you seek, though it ended my life, I would do it. Empty words, with you so far away from me.\n I have sent for my servant and have given orders for my palinquin, so I must bid you farewell for a time.\n From my own hand on the Feast of Saint Matthew, in the 1214th year of Our Lord, in Roma.\n Olivia \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crusader-s-torch-atta-olivia-clemens-2/page-71.html","bookId":2510,"book":{"id":2510,"title":"Crusader\u0027s Torch (Atta Olivia Clemens #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Crusader\u0027s Torch (Atta Olivia Clemens #2) \n The time is 1189 A.D. and war rages all around the Mediterranean.
