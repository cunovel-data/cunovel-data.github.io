{"id":33904,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. \"THE EYES OF THE RED FLEET.\"","content":"While Kenworth, in his cabin, was consoling himself for his smart \"dressing down\" from Ned with the reflection that in the event of the Seneca being badly damaged the lad he so disliked would lose his berth, Ned, on deck, had forgotten in the business of the moment the incident of the intercepted wireless. \n \n Herc reported that no serious strain had been found, and that so far as could be seen the Seneca was resting on the edge of a sand bank. The tide, it had been ascertained, was rising, in itself a fortunate circumstance, and within a short time things would be propitious for an attempt to back the craft off under her own steam. \n \n \"I hope to goodness we succeed, old fellow,\" said Ned fervently, \"although I can\u0027t tell you[Pg 85] what an unspeakable relief to me it has been to know that we are not damaged.\" \n \n \"You can rest assured of that. Every plate and rivet from fore-peak to shaft tunnel has been gone over. Not a drop of water anywhere.\" \n \n \"In that case, provided we can get afloat again without summoning assistance, we may get by without a reprimand or, even worse, a recall,\" declared Ned. \n \n \"Oh, that would be terrible!\" exclaimed Herc. \"But say, Ned, have you done any thinking about this accident?\" \n \n \"What a question to ask! Thinking! I\u0027ve been doing nothing else since we struck.\" \n \n \"But you know what I mean?\" \n \n \"Putting two and two together?\" asked Ned significantly, with a glance at the steering-wheel house that had been their place of concealment. \n \n \"That\u0027s it exactly. Have you been doing that?\" \n \n \"Hum, yes, but they don\u0027t make four—yet.\" \n \n \"But you\u0027ve come to the conclusion that the[Pg 86] accident may not have been quite so accidental as it appeared?\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t say so. What I do say, though, is this, that there is one person on board who was quite willing to take advantage of it, accident or no accident, to discredit us.\" \n \n \"And that was——?\" \n \n \"Mr. Midshipman Kenworth. The rascal! caught him in the wireless room trying to send a message to the Manhattan.\" \n \n Ned went on to relate all that had occurred at that momentous encounter, being frequently interrupted by Herc\u0027s exclamations of indignation. \n \n \"You ought to have Kenworth put in the brig, or at least keep him in his cabin for the rest of the cruise,\" blustered Herc. \n \n \"How can I do that? I have no proof against the fellow. Suspicion is one thing, proof quite another.\" \n \n \"Anyone who knows the fellow——\" \n \n [Pg 87] \n \n \"That\u0027s quite aside from the question. Kenworth has powerful influences behind him. We don\u0027t want to make any more enemies than we have to.\" \n \n \"Oh, pshaw! If I had your powers——\" \n \n \"If I had the proof, I\u0027d act quick enough, you may be sure. I wouldn\u0027t care if his father was Secretary of the Navy—yes, or President. All the more reason for getting rid of such a scalawag. But as it is——\" \n \n \"All ready, sir!\" \n \n The chief bos\u0027un\u0027s mate made the announcement. \n \n \"Very well, Bowles. You may pass the word.\" \n \n \"Now for the tug-of-war,\" said Ned grimly, as, warning the man at the wheel to keep his helm hard over, he sent the signal below for the engines to be started at reverse \"slow.\" \n \n Once more the vibration of her machinery thrilled the hull of the Seneca; but—she did not move. \n \n [Pg 88] \n \n Undisturbed, so far as anyone could see, Ned shoved the telegraph over till little by little the pointer stopped at \"Full speed astern.\" He rang up on the bridge telephone. \n \n \"Give her every ounce you\u0027ve got,\" he ordered. \n \n The water churned whitely; the pipes of the safety valves roared with the pressure of the escaping steam from the high-pressure boilers. The Seneca shook and trembled like a live thing. Then came a sudden impulse. Ned\u0027s eyes began to dance, but he dared not speak. \n \n The next instant he knew that he had not been mistaken. The Seneca was moving. \n \n A cheer burst from the men, who knew that Ned had risen from the foredeck, and liked and admired him on that account. Nobody attempted to check it. Below, in his cabin, Kenworth heard the cheer and felt the slight movement. \n \n \"Confound him! So he has managed to get her afloat, after all,\" he muttered. \"I didn\u0027t pile[Pg 89] her up quick enough. Well, I\u0027ll get another chance, and this time I won\u0027t fall down.\" \n \n Little by little the bulk of the gunboat began to slide backward off the shoal. \n \n From the leadsmen posted on the bow, bridge and stern, came every moment cries announcing deeper and deeper water. Herc silently wrung Ned\u0027s hand. Ned said nothing, but his face showed what he felt. \n \n At last there came a sudden backward lurch and the gunboat was freed from her sandy prison and floated in deep water once more. \n \n \"We\u0027ll have no pilot this time,\" declared Ned, as he himself took the guidance of the ship, scanning the waters ahead with keen eyes and directing the helmsman on his course. They reached open water without accident. And then Ned was at leisure to forward his report of the accident to the Manhattan. \n \n To his relief no comment was made upon it, which he attributed to the fact that there had[Pg 90] been no serious results. But through the air came an order that caused Ned to thrill with delight. He was commanded to peruse his sealed orders and follow them out without delay. \n \n The Manhattan was then some miles north of Block Island, well out to sea with the Red Squadron. Of the Blues, nothing had been heard. \n \n It was for Ned\u0027s ship, as the \"Eyes of the Red Fleet\" to spy out and report the whereabouts of the \"enemy.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775/51746.html","bookId":1110,"book":{"id":1110,"title":"The Dreadnought Boys in Home Waters","description":"简介： The interruption to the stolid apathy that had crept over the passengers, for the dust and heat had made them drowsy, came in the form of voices raised in anger and indignant protest....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
