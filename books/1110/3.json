{"id":33897,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. \"ARE WE AWAKE?\"","content":"The commander of the Manhattan, an imposing, bronzed figure of a man, and a thorough sailor, swung around in his chair and faced the two young Jackies he had summoned. \n \n \"These are the lads I was speaking to you about, Mr. Secretary,\" he said, addressing his companion. \n \n The lads drew themselves up and saluted, not without a quickened action of their hearts. They guessed at once from the manner in which he had been addressed, that the stranger was one of the \"big-wigs\" of the naval department. Herc turned as red as his thatch, and the freckles stood out on his round and jolly countenance like the famous spots on the sun. \n \n Ned retained his self-possession better, but in[Pg 25] reality he was quite as excited as was his shipmate and chum. Eagerly he waited for words which might offer a key to the meaning of this unusual summons. \n \n They were not long in coming. The Secretary nodded his head and looked approvingly at the boys. \n \n \"They quite measure up, sir, to all that I have heard of them,\" he said. \"And now,\" with a kindly smile at the two embarrassed lads, \"I don\u0027t think we need keep them in suspense any longer.\" \n \n \"I quite agree with you,\" rejoined the captain. \"Lads, I have sent for you to confer upon you, at the request of the Secretary of the Navy, a most unusual honor. I know you will appreciate it as it merits.\" \n \n The boys did not utter, in words, a reply. It would not have been proper for them to have made any comments or to have spoken, except in answer to direct orders or to questions. The commander continued: \n \n [Pg 26] \n \n \"Your careers in the navy have been marked by more than ordinary devotion to duty and by frequent exhibitions of ability that have made you both appear to be worthy of still higher promotion than you have yet achieved. I think that you both possess executive ability, and the Secretary and myself have decided to assign you to roles in the coming war game that will give you ample opportunity to show of what sort of stuff you are made.\" \n \n The boys, with burning faces, drew themselves up and saluted. But within their breasts was a wild tumult despite their calm exteriors. What could be coming? \n \n \"And now for what you are to do. You are to proceed to Miller\u0027s Haven on the Connecticut shore and there join the gunboat Seneca. You will convoy two submarines for use in scout work against the Blue fleet, which, of course, you know, is opposed to us and is defending the harbor of New York. You understand?\" \n \n [Pg 27] \n \n \"Y-y-yes, sir,\" rejoined Ned; while Herc, so taken by surprise that he was deprived of articulate speech, merely mumbled something. \n \n \"To whom are we to report, sir?\" ventured Ned. \n \n Commander Dunham smiled and exchanged glances with the departmental visitor. \n \n \"You will report to yourselves. That is, you will be in command of the Seneca.\" \n \n Even Ned\u0027s sense of discipline deserted him at this announcement. \n \n \"In—in command? I—I\u0027m afraid, sir, I——\" \n \n \"I said in command. Practically every commissioned officer in the service will be on other and more important duties. We have, therefore, secured for you temporary commissions, enduring, of course, only during your period of attachment to the Seneca. She is a small boat of not very modern design, but I shall expect to see you perform some important work with her. She is equipped with wireless, of course, and the fact[Pg 28] that both of you understand wireless and the naval code has been another inducement to give you this big chance. You will each get a copy of the special code to be used in the war game when you join the ship.\" \n \n \"Then we—we are officers?\" stuttered Herc, unable to keep silent any longer. As for Ned, outwardly cool and collected, his glowing eyes showed what he thought. \n \n \"Officers temporarily,\" was the reply. \"Here are your commissions.\" \n \n From his desk Commander Dunham took the two documents which to the Dreadnought Boys appeared the most wonderful things they had ever set eyes on. \n \n Handing one to Ned, the commander then spoke some words that sent the boy soaring up into the seventh heaven of delight. \n \n \"This confers on you, Strong, the rank, pay and authority of a lieutenant, junior grade, in the United States Navy. Taylor, your commission[Pg 29] confers upon you the special rank of ensign. \n \n \"That is all. Your uniforms will be secured from the yard tailor. Your instructions are in this sealed package. You are not to open them till you have cleared. From time to time you will get other instructions by wireless, couched in the terms of the secret code adopted by the Red fleet. Your duty, in a nutshell, will be to be the eyes of the Red squadron. Carry on!\" \n \n With this crisp expression of dismissal, the commander turned to his table again. The lads saluted, and marched out of the cabin. \n \n They appeared to be traversing fleecy clouds of wonderful brightness as they made their way forward. \n \n \"Hello, Red-head,\" hailed a gunner\u0027s mate as Herc strutted with all the pride of a peacock to the forward part of the ship, \"what\u0027s biting you?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t talk to me like that, Jenks,\" returned Herc with some hauteur. \"I\u0027m an officer.\" \n \n [Pg 30] \n \n \"A what?\" roared Jenks. \"Say, turn over. You\u0027re on your back. You haven\u0027t been working hard enough lately, Brick-top, and you\u0027re talking in your sleep.\" \n \n \"Wonderful as it all seems, though, Jenks, it\u0027s true,\" said Ned, with dancing eyes. \"But I can\u0027t realize yet that I\u0027m not asleep and dreaming the greatest dream a fellow could ever have.\" \n \n Jenks stared for a minute and then clasped Ned\u0027s hand. \n \n \"I\u0027m mighty glad, shipmate,\" said he. \"You had it coming to you.\" \n \n \"But it isn\u0027t going to last,\" said Herc plaintively. \"It will only hold out as long as the war game, and then we\u0027ll be back in the ranks—that is, if we don\u0027t fall out of bed first.\" \n \n Ned said nothing, but he gazed with absent eyes over the busy scene,—the swarming river and the great yard with its life and movement and busy note of preparation. He was indulging in the most delicious reverie he had ever experienced. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775/51739.html","bookId":1110,"book":{"id":1110,"title":"The Dreadnought Boys in Home Waters","description":"简介： The interruption to the stolid apathy that had crept over the passengers, for the dust and heat had made them drowsy, came in the form of voices raised in anger and indignant protest....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
