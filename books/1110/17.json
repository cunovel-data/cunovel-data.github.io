{"id":33911,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. SURPRISES.","content":"\"Halt!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The command came like the crack of a pistol. Facing Ned stood a sentry in the uniform of the Coast Artillery. In his hands he gripped a carbine with a sinister-looking, blue-steel bayonet attached to its barrel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here\u0027s where you turn back, friend, and pronto, too,\" grinned the sentry. He was a young fellow, with light blue eyes, stupid in expression, and a nose of the type generally described as \"pug.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to get to the fort, I tell you,\" protested Ned. \\n\\n \\n\\n His voice came from his parched throat like the cracked, whistling accents of a very old man. His clothes were torn in places from the beach plums, through which he had come with furious[Pg 137] haste, his eyes were red-rimmed and wild, and his hat was gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sentry regarded him contemptuously. But his was a lonely post, a quarter of a mile out on the sandy Neck, and he decided to waste a little time with this peculiar stranger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, friend, you don\u0027t want the fort. It\u0027s your cage you want. Why don\u0027t you go right back to the Bronx, climb in, and shut the gate?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here,\" protested Ned, \"I\u0027m Lieutenant Strong of the Navy, at least I hold that temporary commission. I\u0027ve been attacked by rascals while on duty and I\u0027m suffering frightfully from thirst.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess you are suffering from thirst,\" grinned the sentry. \"Be a good boy and get back to the bug-house now, or I\u0027ll have to help you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He glanced significantly at his bayonet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Great Scott! Do you think I\u0027m crazy!\" cried poor Ned. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 138] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Think it?\" the sentry raised his thin, pale eyebrows, \"I know it, old pal. Run along and roll your hoop now, and don\u0027t give me no more trouble. If I was to let you into the fort, I\u0027d be put in the guard-house for a month for letting a crank through.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I\u0027m Lieutenant Strong, I tell you——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sentry interrupted by tapping his forehead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure you are. That\u0027s all right. You can be the President if you like; it\u0027s none of my funeral.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a sort of soothing intonation in his voice, as if he were trying to quiet a fractious child. The stupidity of the fellow almost drove Ned wild. \\n\\n \\n\\n He plunged a hand into his pocket. He would show the fellow by documents that he was not an impostor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll show you papers that will prove who I am,\" he exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, with a sudden chill of horror, he recollected[Pg 139] that all his papers—none of them, luckily, very important ones—had been taken from him by Saki and Kenworth. The sentry was watching him, as he frantically searched, with an amused expression. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, what kind of a game are you trying to work, Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a game, I tell you,\" cried Ned furiously. \"Those rascals who tied me took my papers. They have run off with them——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess it\u0027s you that have run off from your keepers,\" said the sentry, nodding his head sententiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was hopeless. Even Ned, sore pressed as he was, saw that. The man was convinced that he was a crank or a crazy man of some sort and would have no dealings with him. Ned spied a canteen hung round the man\u0027s shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At least, you\u0027ll give me a drink,\" he almost begged, so keen was his need. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 140] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It ain\u0027t the sort of drink you want. Nothing but water,\" said the artilleryman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good heavens, man, that\u0027s what I want!\" rasped Ned through his parched lips. \"Give me just a little. Then I\u0027ll go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, if that\u0027s all, drink hearty,\" said the man, in more friendly tones. \\n\\n \\n\\n He cast a look behind him to make sure he was not observed, and then, unslinging his canteen, he passed it to Ned. The water was warm and tasted leathery, but to Ned it was unspeakably delicious. He threw back his head and let it stream over his parched palate and down his cracked throat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cracky! I can hear it sizzle!\" exclaimed the sentry. \"Go on, take it all if you need it as badly as that. I ain\u0027t that thirsty, and besides I\u0027ll be relieved in a short time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ned needed no second invitation. He drained the canteen to the last drop. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m ever so much obliged to you,\" he said[Pg 141] turning away; \"maybe some day I\u0027ll be able to reward you with more than thanks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" replied the sentry heartily. \"I hope you\u0027ll get over that bug of yours about being a lootenant. Why, friend, you might be an orficer in Coxey\u0027s army, but I guess that\u0027s the only branch of the service you ever had any dealings with.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ned said nothing in reply, but with a wave of his hand walked off. He had plenty of opportunity, as he plodded along the Neck, for philosophical reflections on the part that clothes play in this world. Had he worn his uniform, he could have marched past the sentry without question. But, as it was, the man more than suspected him of being an escaped lunatic. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ned\u0027s intention in going to the fort had been to establish instant communication with the authorities and warn them to look out for Kenworth and Saki. Of course, the fort was technically the enemy\u0027s country, but the lad rightly[Pg 142] deemed that the capture of two such renegades as the Jap and the midshipman took precedence of every other consideration. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now, as he made his way back over the shifting sands, his mind was busy revolving plans for the arrest of the two who had served him in such rascally fashion. \\n\\n \\n\\n Musing thus, he was pressing steadily on, when, on topping a rise, he came in sight of a small, sandy cove. Drawn well up into it was a sharp-bowed motor boat. A long engine hood forward showed that she carried powerful engines. On shore, beside her, lay a figure dozing in the shade. The tide rippled pleasantly and the sand alongside the beached craft afforded a cool resting place. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The very thing!\" exclaimed Ned. \"Goodness knows how long it would take me to walk to Civic Island. Some time, anyhow, even if I felt in the humor to do it. I\u0027m pretty sure those[Pg 143] rascals must have made for there, and if I hurry up I might catch them yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, there!\" he hailed, running down the bank to where the man lay. \"Can you start your motor on the jump? I\u0027m in a big hurry and——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the sound of a voice the dozing man rolled over. \\n\\n \\n\\n Right then Ned experienced the surprise of his life. The man was Saki! \\n\\n \\n\\n The shock of this discovery had hardly had time to sink in, and the two were still staring at each other, when from the boat came another voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you\u0027re in a big hurry, come right aboard and save us the trouble of fetching you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ned looked up from Saki and faced Kenworth. The renegade midshipman was regarding him with a sardonic grin. Ned saw that he held a revolver. The weapon was pointed straight at the Dreadnought Boy\u0027s heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775/51753.html","bookId":1110,"book":{"id":1110,"title":"The Dreadnought Boys in Home Waters","description":"简介： The interruption to the stolid apathy that had crept over the passengers, for the dust and heat had made them drowsy, came in the form of voices raised in anger and indignant protest....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
