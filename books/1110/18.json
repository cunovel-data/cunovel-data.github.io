{"id":33912,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. OFF FOR A CRUISE.","content":"Kenworth had a look of triumph on his face. While Ned, dumbfounded at the turn events had taken, faced him, Saki sprang to his feet and also jerked out a pistol. \n \n \"I advise you not to run, my honorable capitan, or to make resistance,\" said the Jap, smiling amiably. \"It would not by any means suit our purposes to have you get away just now. We must, therefore, claim you as our guest.\" \n \n Ned feigned an indifference he was far indeed from feeling. \n \n \"It seems that rascals do have all the luck on their side sometimes, doesn\u0027t it?\" he said. \n \n The Jap did not reply. Instead, he turned to Kenworth, who was still standing on board the motor boat and keeping Ned relentlessly covered with his pistol. \n \n [Pg 145] \n \n \"Put over that gangplank,\" he said. \"We are to have the honor of an unexpected visit from clever Mr. Strong. I cannot imagine how he managed to free himself, but it is greatly to our advantage that, after having done so, he took the path that he did. Now, my honorable sir, if you will give yourself the great trouble to walk up that plank I shall be your most obedient servant. Remember I am close behind you, and if you should feel tempted to jump or run, pray recollect that I am excessively nervous, and in my excitement I might press this trigger.\" \n \n \"You mean you would do so,\" returned Ned. \"I know you and your breed.\" \n \n \"Complimentary, is he not?\" grinned the Jap, addressing Kenworth. \n \n \"It doesn\u0027t matter what he is,\" was the grumbling rejoinder, \"we\u0027ve got him tight this time, and by hookey, I mean to keep him safe and sound.\" \n \n [Pg 146] \n \n \"Oh, yes, there must be no more promenades, honorable Ned,\" chuckled the Jap. \n \n Ned could have throttled the grinning rascal then and there. But he reflected that to make any break to escape would probably result in serious consequences for himself. It was a lonely part of the Neck and concealed from the view of the little-traveled path that led through the brush. \n \n Besides, he thought that possibly another chance to get away might present itself. If he proved troublesome, the two rascals would take double pains to secure him, whereas if they thought he was thoroughly subdued they might not be so particular. \n \n With this thought in mind, he threw back his head proudly and walked across the rickety gangway with a firm step. \n \n \"At least, I won\u0027t let them see that they can scare a sailor of Uncle Sam\u0027s,\" he thought, looking[Pg 147] defiantly into the grimacing face of Kenworth. \n \n As soon as he was on board, the gangplank was drawn in. Then Saki addressed the involuntary guest. \n \n \"Hold out your hands, please, honorable sir.\" \n \n \"What for?\" demanded Ned, although he guessed what was coming. They were going to bind him again. \n \n But this time Ned guessed wrong. That is, on the present occasion the two worthies had clearly decided to use no ordinary methods of insuring the safety of their prisoner. \n \n \"I wish to present you with some jewelry,\" said Saki, with a grin that made Ned wild to give the oily, grimacing ruffian a good drubbing. \n \n The next instant he produced a pair of handcuffs. Ned, situated as he was, had no choice but to submit to being manacled. \n \n \"It\u0027s what I might have expected of you,\" he[Pg 148] said, as Saki snapped the locks shut. \"May I ask what you mean to do with me?\" \n \n \"We will take a little cruise out into open water till it gets dark, and then we shall return to—to—well, we shall return you to a safe place on shore for the night.\" \n \n As the Jap spoke, Kenworth started the engine and then drew in the anchor. The clutch was slipped into forward speed and the motor boat moved out of the little cove, splitting the water at a good rate. \n \n \"You said you were going to take a cruise?\" inquired Ned. \n \n \"Such is our intention,\" rejoined Kenworth, who had the wheel, with a scowl. \n \n \"I should advise you not to,\" was the quiet rejoinder. \n \n \"Why not?\" \n \n For answer Ned pointed to great castellated clouds piled up in majestic masses on the horizon.[Pg 149] They towered whitely against the blue sky and appeared to be traveling at some speed. \n \n \"Well, what about those clouds?\" asked Kenworth, with his customary sneer. \n \n \"Thunder heads. We are in for a bad storm, or I miss my guess,\" said Ned, in the same quiet tones. \n \n \"Hark at the scare-cat!\" chuckled Kenworth. \"Say, Ned Strong, for a braggart upstart you show the white feather mighty soon.\" \n \n \"If only you were concerned,\" retorted Ned, \"I shouldn\u0027t care what became of this craft or those in it. But I\u0027d hate to be drowned, when some day I confidently expect to be the means of bringing you two traitors to justice.\" \n \n It was perhaps an unwise speech, but Ned was mad clear through. Kenworth looked at him keenly. \n \n \"So that\u0027s your little plan, eh?\" he asked. \"Well, I guess we know ways to checkmate that, Saki.\" \n \n [Pg 150] \n \n \"Undoubtedly,\" responded the Jap, gravely nodding his head. \n \n \"That\u0027s all I have to say,\" said Ned; \"go ahead and work out your own salvation. I\u0027ve warned you.\" \n \n \"I always knew you were a coward at bottom, Strong,\" scoffed Kenworth, \"and now I\u0027m going to give you a cruise that will take the starch out of you for the rest of your life.\" \n \n He touched the control, which was on the steering wheel like that of an automobile. The craft leaped forward like a flying fish. The spray flew high on either bow. Kenworth, a wicked gleam in his eyes, headed straight up the Sound. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775/51754.html","bookId":1110,"book":{"id":1110,"title":"The Dreadnought Boys in Home Waters","description":"简介： The interruption to the stolid apathy that had crept over the passengers, for the dust and heat had made them drowsy, came in the form of voices raised in anger and indignant protest....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
