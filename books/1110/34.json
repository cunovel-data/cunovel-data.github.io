{"id":33928,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV. A NEW ASSIGNMENT.","content":"It was the next morning. In Captain Dunham\u0027s cabin on the Manhattan, Herc had just concluded reciting his story to the commander and to no less a person than the Secretary of the Navy. \n \n It had been a badly embarrassed boy who had at first faced the stern questioning of his commanding officer; but by degrees, as his story went on, Captain Dunham\u0027s manner relaxed. His stern air gave place to one of deep interest. And now, at the conclusion of Herc\u0027s narrative, he spoke: \n \n \"I was at first inclined to very grave suspicions of you, Taylor, but your previous good record and your manner convince me that you are telling the truth, more particularly as the department[Pg 273] has been aware for some time of the existence of a band of spies who had, in some way, secured the co?peration of renegades in our navy. We have been trying through the night to get some word of Strong; but we have failed. I\u0027m afraid, my lad, that you must resign yourself to the inevitable. At any rate, Strong, so far as we know, died in the pursuit of his duty and lived up to the best traditions of the navy.\" \n \n \"Then you believe that he is dead, sir?\" Herc blurted out, his freckles showing like scars against his pale cheeks. \n \n \"There is no other conclusion to be reached, Taylor. His long absence from duty, and the lack of all word from him, convince me of the worst. Strong is not the sort of lad to remain out of touch, if he were in the land of the living. You may go now, and the Secretary and myself will talk over the details of rounding up this gang of miscreants. If they had anything to do with Strong\u0027s death, I will give you the satisfaction[Pg 274] of taking part in the pursuit and apprehension of them.\" \n \n The Secretary broke in. \n \n \"That clew that Taylor has in the shape of that scrap of paper, I regard as valuable, Captain,\" he said. \"I would recommend that inquiries be sent out concerning the yacht Halcyon. It is quite possible that the conspirators may be meaning to make good their escape on her. In that case, if we can trace her, she can be intercepted at sea and the men apprehended.\" \n \n \"I shall see that it is done, Mr. Secretary. Taylor, you may carry on and—— Well, orderly?\" \n \n Captain Dunham looked up inquiringly as his orderly entered the cabin in some haste, and, after saluting, stood respectfully at attention. But it was plain from the man\u0027s manner that he was laboring under some excitement. \n \n \"The officer of the deck reports an airship[Pg 275] coming this way, sir,\" said the orderly. \"He told me to inform you at once, sir.\" \n \n \"An airship!\" \n \n \"Yes, sir, or else a flying boat. We can\u0027t quite make out yet, sir.\" \n \n \"I will come on deck at once. Mr. Secretary, this may prove interesting. Possibly it is one of the Blue scouts; if so, I hope to bring the craft down, \u0027technically,\u0027 of course.\" \n \n Herc saluted and hastened forward, while the captain and the Secretary of the Navy emerged on the deck. The Red fleet lay off Rock Island. They were awaiting word as to the movements of the \"Blues\" before steaming down the Sound to the attack. \n \n So far, the wireless had been barren of news, and the movements of the defending squadron were surrounded with considerable mystery. The suspense had been wearing, and so every eye in the squadron, from Dreadnought, battleship, cruiser, destroyer, and torpedo boat, was centered[Pg 276] on the strange aeroplane that was flying toward them. \n \n Opinion was divided as to whether the distant flying machine was an aerial scout, or was a friendly craft bearing despatches from a portion of the squadron which had been sent around on the Atlantic side. \n \n On came the flying craft, and as it neared the grim fleet that lay swinging with smoking funnels at anchor on the blue tide, it was seen to swerve downward like a swooping fish-hawk. For a mile or more it skimmed along the surface of the water and then struck it with a splash. \n \n \"A flying boat!\" exclaimed Captain Dunham, who had the binoculars on it. \n \n The craft drove straight on over the water at a rapid rate of speed. As it drew closer, Captain Dunham exclaimed in a voice that trembled with excitement, despite his efforts to control it: \n \n \"Great Scott! That\u0027s one of our men!\" \n \n [Pg 277] \n \n \"A man attached to the Red fleet?\" asked the Secretary. \n \n \"Yes, he is wig-wagging with his free arm. It\u0027s—it\u0027s—great Scott! It\u0027s Ned Strong, by all that\u0027s wonderful!\" \n \n It was half an hour later, and Ned had told his story. It was a concise, crisp statement occupying no more time than was necessary, but embodying a wonderful amount of important information. When he came to relate how he had \"appropriated\" one of the Blue fleet\u0027s aeroplanes and had flown straight to the Manhattan in it, the enthusiasm of his hearers knew no bounds. \n \n For the time being, interest in this phase of his adventures even overtopped the recovery of the book of plans and coast defences taken from Kenworth. The book was found to contain full details of fire-control systems, gun tests, and other naval data of the utmost importance. \n \n \"By Neptune, lad, the United States Navy[Pg 278] owes you a debt of gratitude it can hardly repay,\" exclaimed Captain Dunham, with shining eyes. \n \n \"I shall see, however, that the service does what is in its power to recognize the signal ability you have displayed, Mr. Strong,\" remarked the Secretary. \n \n \"Thank you, sir,\" responded Ned, with glowing cheeks, \"but the knowledge that I have been of service to the Flag is in itself reward enough.\" \n \n \"Hardly substantial, however,\" smiled the Secretary. \n \n A few moments later Ned was dismissed and joined Herc. Their greeting was not an effusive one on the surface. Both had been trained in a school where men are taught to restrain and control their emotions. But in the hearty handclasp, and the few spoken words, each friend recognized the glad emotion that the other was feeling over their reunion. \n \n [Pg 279] \n \n Later in the day both lads were summoned to the captain\u0027s cabin. \n \n \"Here is where we lose our commands,\" said Herc, with dismal foreboding. \n \n He was right. Captain Dunham\u0027s first words apprised both boys that they were no longer officers. \n \n \"You are relieved of the command of your gunboat,\" said the captain crisply; and then, as the boys\u0027 faces fell, despite all their efforts to maintain \"stiff upper lips,\" he added, \"to take charge of an expedition which will be explained to you.\" \n \n The boys longed to exchange glances, but they stood stiffly at \"eyes front.\" What could be coming now? \n \n \"We have located the yacht Halcyon,\" said the Secretary briefly. \"The secret service men have placed us in possession of facts which make it certain that Saki and the rest are on board her. She is to sail to-night.\" \n \n [Pg 280] \n \n \"Shall you not intercept her, sir?\" asked Ned, betrayed by his interest into a breach of naval etiquette. \n \n \"Of course. That will be your duty.\" \n \n \"Our duty, sir?\" \n \n \"Yes. You are assigned, in virtue of your commissions, to the command of the Henry, second-class destroyer. You will intercept and place under arrest the men on board the Halcyon and bring the craft back to New York harbor.\" \n \n \"When do we start, sir?\" \n \n \"At once. The crew of the Henry have been notified. Steam is up and everything in readiness. You will, of course, keep in constant communication by wireless, using the code. When you overhaul the Halcyon, use no half-way measures. Arrest everyone on board, seize all documents and denounce the ship. In particular, apprehend the man calling himself Saki. He is in reality Captain Hasamira of the Japanese Navy and a most dangerous man.\" \n \n [Pg 281] \n \n \"He certainly proved so to these lads,\" smiled Captain Dunham. \"Now be off with you, boys, and bring back the men you are going after. We shall rely on you.\" \n \n \"Aye, aye, sir,\" said both Dreadnought Boys saluting, though their hearts were in such a wild tumult that they hardly knew what they were saying. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775/51770.html","bookId":1110,"book":{"id":1110,"title":"The Dreadnought Boys in Home Waters","description":"简介： The interruption to the stolid apathy that had crept over the passengers, for the dust and heat had made them drowsy, came in the form of voices raised in anger and indignant protest....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
