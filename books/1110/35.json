{"id":33929,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV. THE OUTCOME.","content":"In the gray of the next morning the Henry, a squat, low craft of the destroyer type, with three fat funnels, lay tossing uneasily on the sweeping combers of the Atlantic some sixty-two miles south of Sandy Hook. \n \n She had lain there most of the night, using her searchlight freely. But no craft answering to the description of the Halcyon had passed within her ken. \n \n On the conning tower, Ned and Herc, for the twentieth time at least, went over the last wireless they had received from the Secret Service squad,—via the Manhattan. \n \n \"Cruise slowly about off Sandy Hook. Sixty-two miles to the south about. Halcyon should pass out in early morning. Is painted black, yellow[Pg 283] deck houses, two masts, black stack amidships.\" \n \n \"It isn\u0027t possible that she has slipped by us in the night, do you think?\" exclaimed Herc, gazing anxiously about at the rolling waste of gray water. \n \n \"Not likely. That despatch came only an hour ago. If we remain here we are almost bound to intercept her.\" \n \n \"And if she does slip past us?\" \n \n \"Then I\u0027ll keep after her, if I have to crack on clear down to the South Pole,\" said Ned grimly. \"I don\u0027t intend to let that gang slip through my fingers!\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve got a few scores to settle myself,\" cried Herc. \"When I think of that cellar——\" \n \n He gritted his teeth and clenched his freckled fists. It would have fared ill with any of the gang within reach of his hands at that moment. \n \n \"Well, let\u0027s go below to breakfast,\" said Ned[Pg 284] presently. \"The watch will notify us of anything unusual.\" \n \n \"Breakfast!\" scoffed Herc. \"I suppose it will be the same as supper last night. Business of eating with one hand while you claw on to a stanchion with the other. Tell you what, Ned, these destroyers are too lively a type of craft for me.\" \n \n \"They\u0027re just the type to overhaul those rascals we\u0027re after, and that\u0027s good enough for me,\" rejoined Ned. \"I wouldn\u0027t care if I had to eat standing on my head just to get a chance at those fellows.\" \n \n \"\u0027Use no half-way measures,\u0027\" said Herc musingly, repeating the Secretary\u0027s instructions. \"I guess we won\u0027t, Ned, eh?\" \n \n \"Well, if they should happen to want trouble, they\u0027ll get all that they\u0027re looking for,\" laughed Ned, as they descended the pitching, swinging iron ladder that led to the cramped cabin of the Henry. \n \n [Pg 285] \n \n They had had hardly time to down some coffee and eat some bacon when there came a report from the bow watch. \n \n \"Smoke to the north\u0027ard, sir.\" \n \n Breakfast was forgotten in a flash. Snatching up his binoculars, Ned sprang for the iron ladder. Herc was right at his heels. \n \n On the northern horizon lay a smudge of black smoke. For some moments it was hard to make out whether it was receding or coming toward them. But presently Ned, with a cry of delight, announced that the stranger was coming due south. \n \n Not long after, the strange craft swam into the field of vision of the binoculars. Herc happened to be holding them on her at that moment. He gave an exclamation of disgust. \n \n \"It\u0027s a yacht, all right, but not the right one.\" \n \n \"How do you know?\" \n \n \"That description. I\u0027ve got it by heart. Two[Pg 286] masts, black funnel. This fellow\u0027s got three masts and a yellow stack.\" \n \n \"Let me have a look at her.\" \n \n \"Go ahead if you want to; you won\u0027t see any more than I\u0027ve been telling you.\" \n \n \"Well?\" inquired Herc, after a somewhat long interval. The yacht had come closer now. She was being driven hard as they could see by the constant cloud of black smoke that came rolling out of her funnel. The crew of the destroyer, who in some mysterious way had some inkling of the mission of the Henry, watched the oncoming yacht with as much interest as their young officers. \n \n \"Well, what do you make of her?\" demanded Herc, repeating his question. \n \n \"Hold on a minute! I\u0027m studying her.\" \n \n \"Studying her! There\u0027s not much to study over. It\u0027s the wrong craft; anyone could see that with half an eye.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m not so sure of that. She\u0027s a funny looking[Pg 287] tub. Do you notice anything odd about her, Herc?\" \n \n \"Not I; except that she isn\u0027t the craft we are looking for, confound her.\" \n \n \"Well, there is something queer about her. Notice that after mast. It doesn\u0027t appear to fit, somehow, and that stern looks funny, too.\" \n \n \"Jove! now that you speak of it, it does look queer. Say, Ned, you don\u0027t think they could have disguised her, do you?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve heard of such things. I don\u0027t want to make any blunder, and yet that vessel looks to me as if she had been thimble-rigged in some sort of way.\" \n \n Midshipman Fuller, junior officer to the Dreadnought Boys, came on the bridge. Ned turned to him. \n \n \"Mr. Fuller, what do you make of that yacht yonder?\" asked Ned. \n \n \"She\u0027s a queer looking craft, sir. Looks awkward by the stern,\" said the midshipman. \n \n [Pg 288] \n \n \"Just what I think. Mr. Fuller, you will take the bridge.\" \n \n \"You are going to board her?\" demanded Herc. \n \n \"Yes, there\u0027s something wrong about her. I wouldn\u0027t dare to take a chance and let her get by.\" \n \n \"Bully for you,\" said Herc under his breath. \n \n \"Mr. Fuller, please have the boarding launch lowered with the regular crew. The bow gun may be uncovered and when I give you the order, you may fire a shot across that craft\u0027s bow. First, however, I\u0027ll signal her to heave to.\" \n \n The boarding launch referred to was a small power launch carried amidships on the destroyer. The sea was rather rough for such a small craft, but she was staunch, and Ned had no fear but that she would ride the combers without difficulty. \n \n In obedience to his command, a string of[Pg 289] brightly colored bunting presently crawled up the destroyer\u0027s military mast. \n \n It was the signal to \"heave to.\" \n \n But the strange yacht showed no inclination to obey. She kept right on plowing through the big seas with a crest of foam at her bow. \n \n \"You may fire, Mr. Fuller.\" \n \n Ned\u0027s voice was perfectly calm; but Herc could hardly keep still. The bow rapid-fire gun had been stripped of its waterproof cover and its crew was \"standing by.\" The order to fire came crisply. \n \n \"Let her have it across the bows!\" \n \n Bang! The gun barked out viciously. They could see the shot go ricocheting off over the waves. \n \n But the stranger kept serenely on. \n \n \"Give it to her again,\" ordered Ned. \n \n Bang! Once more a shot whizzed across the recalcitrant stranger\u0027s prow. It struck the water not more than twenty-five feet ahead of her. \n \n [Pg 290] \n \n \"Concern \u0027em, that ought to stop \u0027em,\" growled Herc. \n \n But it didn\u0027t. More smoke rolled out of the yacht\u0027s stack. Her speed was increased, if anything. \n \n \"I\u0027m certain now that we\u0027re on the right track,\" grated out Ned; \"no honest craft would ignore a signal like that.\" \n \n Then a moment later he turned to Herc. \n \n \"Mr. Taylor, go below and sight that gun yourself. Let her have it across the fore-deck. I\u0027ll make them heave to if I have to blow a hole in them.\" \n \n Herc was nothing loath. Repressing a grin in virtue of the dignity of his office, he took charge of the gun. He pointed it carefully and as the destroyer rose on the crest of a wave, Ned gave the command. \n \n \"Fire!\" \n \n Bang! \n \n The next instant an exultant cheer broke from[Pg 291] the excited Jackies. The foremast of the stranger toppled, and then in a tangled wreck, came smashing down to the deck. \n \n \"Bull\u0027s eye!\" remarked Herc coolly, flicking a powder stain off his gloves. \n \n \"Stopped her, sir!\" exclaimed Midshipman Fuller an instant later. \n \n He was right. The last \"hint\" had been too strong to ignore. The stranger slackened speed and lay sullenly tossing on the sea. \n \n \"Mr. Fuller, sir, take the bridge,\" ordered Ned, as he and Herc hastened to board the little power launch that lay tossing alongside, held off from crashing against the steel sides of the Henry by the stalwart arms of its crew. \n \n Tossing like an eggshell, hurled dizzily skyward and then plunged downward, the dory-shaped power boat rapidly skimmed the distance between the destroyer and the yacht. Ned had ordered \"side-arms,\" and the crew of six was fully armed. \n \n [Pg 292] \n \n \"Yacht, ahoy!\" hailed Ned as they drew near and a uniformed figure appeared on the yacht\u0027s bridge. \"What craft is that?\" \n \n \"The Spendthrift of New London for New Orleans,\" came the reply. \"What\u0027s the matter with you navy fellows?\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll soon find out,\" said Ned grimly. \"Lay alongside, men. Be prepared for a surprise.\" \n \n An accommodation ladder had been lowered by order of the man on the bridge, a stout, bearded individual. Ned was just preparing to climb it, when there came a warning shout from Herc. The red-headed lad pulled his chum back just in time to dodge a heavy iron weight which some unseen hand had hurled from above. \n \n The weight fell harmlessly into the water. \n \n \"It was a Jap threw that; I saw him sneaking along the deck,\" cried one of the men. \n \n \"Hurrah! We\u0027ve got the right craft, then!\" cried Herc. \n \n \"What is the matter, gentlemen?\" demanded[Pg 293] the man on the bridge. He appeared much agitated. \n \n \"The matter is that you will consider yourself under arrest,\" cried Ned. \"Remain where you are and order your crew forward.\" \n \n \"You take things with a high hand. Who do you think we are?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know anything about you; but I know that this craft is the Halcyon with a faked stern, a false mizzen-mast and a repainted funnel,\" retorted Ned angrily. \"I shall hold you responsible for the behavior of your crew.\" \n \n The bearded man appeared to be about to collapse. In a feeble voice they heard him order his crew forward. \n \n \"I call you to witness that this is a chartered yacht,\" he cried, \"and that I\u0027m obeying your orders. I don\u0027t want to get into trouble with Uncle Sam.\" \n \n \"I guess you\u0027re in pretty bad,\" muttered Herc grimly. \n \n [Pg 294] \n \n Without further opposition they boarded the yacht, which there was no longer reason to doubt was the Halcyon. \n \n As they gained the deck, some figures darted along it and vanished. \n \n Headed by Ned and Herc, three of the men dashed after them. The rest were left to guard the deck. \n \n \"That was Kenworth and Saki,\" gasped Herc as they rushed down the companionway stairs and into the main saloon of the yacht. \n \n Ned nodded grimly. \n \n \"We\u0027ve rounded them up at last,\" he said drawing his revolver and ordering Herc to do the same. \n \n Slam! \n \n Just as they gained the saloon, the door of a stateroom opening from it was banged to. An instant later came the click of a bolt as it was shot. \n \n \"Open that door, Kenworth,\" cried Ned with[Pg 295] perfect coolness. \"You\u0027re at the end of your rope.\" \n \n Crack! \n \n Ned dodged just in time to avoid a bullet fired through the panel of the door. Desperate, with nothing to hope for but a federal prison, Kenworth was fighting like a cornered rat. \n \n But Ned\u0027s voice did not shake, in spite of the narrowness of his escape, as he addressed the wretched man within the stateroom. \n \n \"Kenworth, it is useless to resist. Be sensible and give yourself up. You are bound to be taken, and to try to stave it off makes it all the worse.\" \n \n Bang! Another bullet was the only answer vouchsafed. The missile fanned Herc\u0027s ear and buried itself in the moulding of the saloon wall. \n \n \"I\u0027ll stand no more nonsense!\" cried Ned sternly. \"Are you going to surrender?\" \n \n \"Never. I\u0027ll die before I\u0027ll rot in a federal prison,\" cried Kenworth wildly. \n \n Ned turned to Herc. \n \n [Pg 296] \n \n \"We\u0027ve got to force the door,\" he said in a low voice. \n \n \"But, Ned, the man is half insane. Why not shoot him down from outside here?\" \n \n \"As if I\u0027d do a thing like that! Come on!\" \n \n Right then the Jackies standing behind the two young officers beheld an exhibition of pure nerve that they had never seen excelled. Ned raised his revolver and fired through the top of the stateroom door where his bullet would be certain to hurt no one. As he expected, it drew Kenworth\u0027s fire. \n \n Bang-Bang-Bang! came three shots. Ned knew that the cylinder of the crazed midshipman\u0027s revolver must be empty. \n \n \"Now!\" he shouted. \"Stand by, men!\" \n \n Rip-p-p-p! Cr-ash-h-h-h! The door was carried clean off its hinges as Ned and Herc rushed it. As it fell, the interior of the stateroom, reeking with blue powder smoke, was revealed. Huddled on the bunk in postures of abject terror were[Pg 297] Saki and the spectacled Jap who had caused Herc so much trouble. \n Rip-p-p-p! Cr-ash-h-h-h! The door was carried off its hinges as Ned and Herc rushed in.—Page 296 \n \n In the center of the room stood Kenworth. His eyes blazed with a wild fire and he flourished an empty revolver, while he yelled incoherently. \n \n At the sight of Ned and Herc, the half insane man uttered a piercing cry. \n \n \"I thought you were both dead!\" he cried. \"But you have risen from the grave to confront me!\" \n \n He slipped another cartridge into his revolver, and Ned leaped forward just in time to dash the weapon from the wretched renegade\u0027s hand. He had turned the pistol on himself. \n \n Within half an hour, Kenworth, by that time a raging maniac, had been secured, and the two Japs in sullen silence had been escorted with the renegade midshipman on board the Henry. A search of the Halcyon revealed several men among the crew whom Herc recalled having seen in the plotters\u0027 headquarters at Civic Island.[Pg 298] Many papers and documents which there was not time to examine just then were also recovered. \n \n Ned placed three men in charge of the Halcyon with orders to make her captain follow him into New York harbor. Then he wirelessed news of his success to the Manhattan and received a warm reply of congratulation that made his blood glow and his eyes shine. Herc, too, came in for a share of commendation. With the congratulations, came orders to proceed to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and see that Kenworth was placed in a hospital, for he was no longer responsible. \n \n It was two days later. The Dreadnought Boys stood facing the Secretary of the Navy in the office of the commander of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. What was to come, they did not know. They had not yet been relieved of their command of the Henry, and they feared that the summons to present themselves to the Secretary was for that purpose. \n \n [Pg 299] \n \n \"Well, gentlemen,\" said the Secretary, looking approvingly at the two spruce, smart, young officers, \"I suppose that you have no wish to take off those uniforms?\" \n \n \"Naturally not, sir,\" returned Ned, for Herc was too embarrassed to speak. \"It is the finest uniform in the world and no one would willingly doff it.\" \n \n \"Just what I think, Strong,\" said the Secretary, \"and I\u0027m going to see to it that you do not change these uniforms except for those of a higher rank in the service.\" \n \n Ned\u0027s eyes grew dim. The room swam before him. He could hardly believe his ears. But the Secretary continued, \n \n \"As I said the other day, both you young men have shown ability of no common order, native qualities that cannot be inducted by Naval Academies or colleges. I have therefore made arrangements to have your present appointments made permanent, and you will, hereafter, by[Pg 300] special act, assume them with their rank, pay and dignity until you are ready for the next step upward; and I promise you that I shall keep my eye upon you.\" \n \n \"Mr. Secretary, I—we—that is—we don\u0027t know what to say, except to thank you and assure you that it is the proudest moment of our lives,\" stammered Ned hoarsely in a voice that sounded to him faint and far away. As for Herc, he stood like one stunned, his freckles coming and going on his alternately ruddy and pale cheeks like pictures in a kaleidoscope. \n \n To relieve the situation, the Secretary changed the subject. \n \n \"After the maneuvers, you will be granted a furlough of one month. For the present, you will retain command of the Henry and will rejoin the Red fleet with all speed. By the way, I may tell you that Kenworth can never recover his reason. His mind is a total wreck. I suppose it is charitable to attribute his treachery to[Pg 301] his weakened intellect. As for the Japanese spies, the government can only quietly see to it that they are escorted out of the country never to return. I understand that in Japan the life of a detected spy is not a happy one, so that they will meet their punishment even if the government of this country cannot inflict a penalty upon them. Against Rankin, of whose actions on the Seneca we know, we have proved nothing; but he will be watched.\" \n \n And here, with the glory of their new honors upon them, we must say \"Good-by\" once more to the Dreadnought Boys. The events just chronicled are so recent that it may be some time before we can set down their further adventures. The lads have been accepted most cordially by their brother officers and are loved and respected by their men. \n \n Success has not turned their heads and as officers they are proving the same modest, self-respecting lads as ever. The Secretary and their[Pg 302] immediate superiors are keeping their eyes on the two young officers, and ere long they will doubtless have further chances to distinguish themselves. \n \n But whether they are assigned to routine duty or to exciting, adventurous cruises, the Dreadnought Boys will always devote themselves, heart and soul, to the defence of one standard—the Flag of their country. \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775/51771.html","bookId":1110,"book":{"id":1110,"title":"The Dreadnought Boys in Home Waters","description":"简介： The interruption to the stolid apathy that had crept over the passengers, for the dust and heat had made them drowsy, came in the form of voices raised in anger and indignant protest....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
