{"id":33921,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. THROUGH THE CRACK IN THE WALL.","content":"As Ned\u0027s feet sounded on the boards of the stuffy little cuddy, he heard a sharp \"bang\" above him and then the grating of a rusty iron bolt, as it was shot to, making him a prisoner. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sound of the grating bolt and the sense that he was a captive, even though in a sense a voluntary one, made Ned see \"red\" for an instant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So they couldn\u0027t even trust to my word!\" he muttered angrily to himself; and then, \"All this precaution shows that there is something very out of the ordinary going forward. Something, too, that unless I miss my guess is in the line of my commission to find out. Gee whiz, I\u0027d give a lot to know right now what is at the bottom of all this how-d\u0027ye-do!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 215] \\n\\n \\n\\n Ned cast himself down on a transom. For a time silence reigned on deck. Then he became aware of a trampling of feet above him and the sound of hoarse voices hailing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Somebody coming alongside,\" surmised Ned, with ready apprehension of what was going forward. \"It must be dark by this time. Clearly whatever their business is, it is such that does not bear the light of day for its transaction.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The noise on deck continued. Ned scrutinized his place of captivity for some means of seeing without its confines. But except for the scuttle which had been secured, the cabin was without openings. No port-holes or air vents were visible. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If only I could see out,\" he muttered, \"that would help some.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then came more voices outside. Above them sounded sharp, authoritative tones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the great bow gun, whoever is giving orders out there is a man-o\u0027-war\u0027s-man!\" exclaimed[Pg 216] the Dreadnought Boy. \"Something is in the wind in connection with the Blue fleet beyond a doubt. By hookey, I may be on the verge of making some discovery which will be invaluable to our side.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He listened greedily now. His trained ears had not deceived him. It was a man-o\u0027-war \"steamer\" that had glided up to Captain Briggs\u0027 down-at-heel craft. She now lay alongside, while her crew of Jackies hustled up upon the schooner\u0027s dirty decks and their leader, a petty officer, greeted Captain Briggs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll get to work just as soon as you\u0027re ready,\" grunted Captain Briggs to this individual, who had introduced himself as Gunner\u0027s Mate Steffens of the destroyer Truxton. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently, to Ned in the cabin below, came the sounds of hurrying action on deck. He heard the blows of hammers as the battens were ripped off hatchways and the cargo of the[Pg 217] schooner, whatever it was, lay ready for the broachers. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a partition forward in the cabin, and Ned guessed that beyond it must lie the hold with its mysterious contents. He stationed himself against the bulkhead awaiting developments. \\n\\n \\n\\n While he stood there listening to the creaking of blocks and tackles, as apparatus for transferring the cargo of the schooner to the \"steamer\" was in process of rigging, his eye was caught by a sudden gleam of light. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cabin was dark, so he the more easily saw the long, thin slice of radiance that he was not long in finding out leaked through a longitudinal crack in the bulkhead, which was of the flimsiest construction. \\n\\n \\n\\n Clearly enough, the hold was illuminated by the cargo broachers and this light filtered through from it. Ned lost no time in applying an eye to the crack thus luckily revealed. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 218] \\n\\n \\n\\n He stood at gaze for a moment or two, his optic riveted to the crack. Then he started back with an exclamation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Great ginger! Talk about luck! Why, this is the very thing the commander was anxious to find out about. I heard him talking it over with some of the officers. He mentioned it, too, in my instructions.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ned applied himself afresh to the crack. He might have been carved out of stone, so motionless did he stand there. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the hold beyond, all was confusion, shouts, trampling feet and activity. \\n\\n \\n\\n One after another big boxes and bales were hoisted out to be lowered into the waiting steamer. Through his crack Ned overheard enough to show him that the cargo was being transferred as fast as was possible under cover of the night. \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as she was filled to her capacity, the steamer scurried off and then returned again for[Pg 219] a fresh cargo. From the brevity of these intervals of absence, Ned was able to argue that wherever the mysterious cargo was being taken, that place at least was not very far off. \\n\\n \\n\\n More than likely it was some spot along the lonesome shore. In fact, Ned now recalled that below the skeleton-like semaphore he had noticed the decaying remnants of what had plainly enough once been a dock. If it was desired to land the schooner\u0027s cargo in secret, what more likely spot would offer for the disposal of it than this abandoned dock on a desolate shore? \\n\\n \\n\\n Ned had seen enough of what was going forward in the hold and overheard enough, too, to convince him of the nature of the cargo that was being landed. \\n\\n \\n\\n By a stroke of fortune that seemed almost miraculous, he had, or he was very much mistaken, stumbled upon the headquarters of the Aero division of the Blue fleet. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cargo of the schooner consisted of supplies[Pg 220] brought from the government station at Newport for the \"Flying Squadron.\" There is hardly a boy in the land who does not know of the tremendous importance attached by modern governments to the aeroplane, or the hydro-aeroplane, as an adjunct to a battle fleet in time of war. \\n\\n \\n\\n Readers of \"The Dreadnought Boys on Aero Service\" are aware that Ned was proficient enough in this branch of the service to realize at once the importance of the discovery he had made. He knew, too, that according to reports, the Blue fleet\u0027s main attack was to be made by war-aeroplanes. It was ignorance of the number and location of these flying harpies of the air that had caused the authorities of the Red fleet much anxiety. To be \"technically dynamited\" by a squadron of aeroplanes would result in almost certain defeat. \\n\\n \\n\\n Small wonder was it then that Ned\u0027s heart leaped in elation as he realized that he had stumbled[Pg 221] by sheer good luck upon the information wanted. But mingled with his delight came a sobering reflection. \\n\\n \\n\\n He might have located the Blue\u0027s Aero fleet; but he was hardly in a position to put his knowledge to much practical use. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775/51763.html","bookId":1110,"book":{"id":1110,"title":"The Dreadnought Boys in Home Waters","description":"简介： The interruption to the stolid apathy that had crept over the passengers, for the dust and heat had made them drowsy, came in the form of voices raised in anger and indignant protest....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1775","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
