{"id":84815,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Making a liar out of me, the next morning saw me on my way back to the movie set, which today, I\u0027d discovered, was the Sparling County Courthouse. I was still blinking and trying to feel completely alert. Beside me in the front seat was my friend Angel Youngblood: mother, stunt-woman, and former bodyguard. Pregnancy and motherhood had not had any visible effect on Angel\u0027s long, sleek body.\n When the phone had rung at the crack of dawn, Angel\u0027s was the last voice I\u0027d expected to hear. \"Hey, Roe,\" she\u0027d said, her flat Florida drawl instantly recognizable. \"Listen, I need some help.\"\n \"What?\" I knew I sounded groggy, and I tried to focus on the clock. It was six, time for me to get up and get ready for work.\n \"Sorry I woke you up.\"\n \"No, no, I have to get ready for work anyway. What can I do for you?\" Angel never called without a reason; she wasn\u0027t a chatterer.\n \"Shelby\u0027s already at work with his car, mine won\u0027t start, and I need to leave the baby-sitter hers because Joan\u0027s got a doctor\u0027s appointment today. Can you give me a lift to the movie set?\"\n I ran a hand over my face, and recalled that Angel had told me she\u0027d gotten work on the set. \"Sure,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll be there in thirty minutes or less.\"\n \"Thanks.\" Angel hung up.\n I washed my face and brushed my teeth, pulled on a long, pale orange tee-shirt style dress and a light sweater, slid into some clogs, powdered my face, and clattered down the stairs and out the front door before I had really attained consciousness. I was a little more alert by the time I beeped the horn outside Angel and Shelby\u0027s ranch-style home.\n Angel slid out of the front door like a thief in the night, her Capri-length black stretch pants and her white blouse emphasizing her golden colors and smooth body movements. Her thick blond hair was caught back in a ponytail, and she wore no makeup, which was Angel\u0027s norm.\n \"How\u0027s Joan?\" I asked as Angel climbed into the car.\n Angel grinned, and went from looking serious and possibly dangerous to looking like a mother who was proud as hell of the most wonderful baby in the world. \"She\u0027s into banging on pots and pans,\" Angel told me, and we talked about Joan\u0027s progress for a minute or two. \"My neighbor is keeping her today. She has a little boy a couple of months older. Courthouse,\" she reminded me, and as I pulled away from the curb to go to Lawrenceton\u0027s fake-antebellum edifice, she began to tell me about a civil confrontation Shelby had had with Martin\u0027s replacement at the Pan-Am Agra plant.\n I was listening with great interest, when I stood back and gave myself a hard look. Was I that dreary clich¨¦, the hometown honey? I found the Hollywood people boring, compared to Angel\u0027s fascinating account of little Joan\u0027s first crawling. Maybe I was pulling a double cross on myself, pretending enthrallment with family scenes of the Youngbloods to hide my secret lust for the Hollywood way of life?\n It was both a relief and a slight disappointment to touch the bottom of my well of self-absorption and find I was absolutely sincere in my preference for the small details of home. And I was definitely getting a little too fond of my own navel, I concluded. So I concentrated on listening to every single thing Angel told me. I even volunteered to baby-sit Joan one evening so Angel and Shelby could go out together. Angel rolled her eyes at me doubtfully, but agreed to talk to Shelby about my offer.\n Today the trailers and cables and cameras - all the paraphernalia I\u0027d seen yesterday - had been set up in a new location, the front yard of the courthouse. Even the Molly\u0027s Moveable Feasts van was there, with its table set up and attended by the same auburn-headed young woman. (If she was actually Molly, who was doing the cooking?) Today the table was spread with pitchers of juice and doughnuts, and a plate of fruit. I wondered, for the first time, how long the movie people would actually have to stay in town.\n Robin had told me that most of the shots filmed in Lawrenceton would be exteriors. Sets would be built back at the studio for interior scenes. So maybe scenes dealing with the trial were being shot today? I wondered why on earth they\u0027d need a stuntwoman, and decided maybe it would be better not to ask.\n For the first time, as Angel scanned the street for some safe parking spot, I thought of how difficult it would be to be an actor, to have to imagine how your character would\u0027ve changed as a result of scenes you hadn\u0027t shot yet. You\u0027d have to figure out how the character would react after some of the events in the film, before you\u0027d ever emotionally experienced them. There was more to this acting than met the eye.\n I had intended to drop Angel off and go on my way, but she knew one of the women working in the crew and wanted to introduce me. The friend, Carolina Venice, was one of the makeup artists working in a big trailer a little west of the courthouse. Angel\u0027s friend looked as exotic as her name. Easily five feet eleven, Carolina Venice had a smoking habit, cornrowed and beaded hair, and multiple piercings. The lip and tongue decorations made me a little queasy, I have to confess, though the woman was as warm and welcoming as she could be.\n \"Give me fifteen minutes,\" she said. \"I have to finish this woman, and then I\u0027ll be with you. Here, settle into these chairs.\" There were two cheap lawn chairs on the rolling platform (with steps built in) that had been pushed up to the makeup trailer.\n I perched on one, looking around me to see if I could spy Robin. I felt a certain need to explain why I was where I\u0027d said I would never go again. I was just yards away from Celia\u0027s trailer - at least I was pretty sure it was the same one Celia had used the day before. Will Weir, pulling on a lightweight jacket, was saying something over his shoulder to (I presumed) Celia, nodding, as he shut the door. Everyone I saw had the Styrofoam cups of coffee and juice that Molly\u0027s Moveable Feasts was handing out. Mark Chesney went to the door of the trailer and knocked, but hurried away after a moment. I wasn\u0027t close enough to hear what response he\u0027d gotten. A young woman I didn\u0027t know darted up to the door, cracked it slightly, and called something inside. Then she darted away as quickly as she\u0027d come. I was interrupted in my study of movie location movement patterns by the emergence of Carolina, who\u0027d had time to get pumped up about talking to her old friend.\n She hugged Angel, shrieked at pictures of the baby, asked after Shelby, and behaved exactly like a happily reunited friend, gold hoops or no gold hoops. After a minute, it was easy to forget her bizarre appearance and respond to her warmth and cheer.\n When the two were deep into reminiscence, I decided I could use some orange juice. I strolled over to the laden table.\n \"Can I pour you some coffee?\" asked the young woman. She had discarded one white coat and was pulling on another. I was willing to bet that white coats had a high turnover. While I picked up a cup of juice, I noticed that she was prettier close-up. Her dark red hair was thick and smooth, her skin was clear, and her eyes were a nice blue. It was her heavy jaw that threw her face off balance and prevented her from being really attractive. The embroidered name on her white jacket read \"Tracy.\"\n \"So you\u0027re not Molly,\" I remarked.\n She laughed. \"No, no. Molly\u0027s the genius. I\u0027m just the server. When I clean this table up, it\u0027ll be time for Molly to come with the bag lunches for the crew. Then when I clear those away, it\u0027ll be afternoon snack time.\"\n \"You must get to know everyone who works here.\"\n \"By sight, anyway,\" she agreed. \"They\u0027re all pretty cool. In this kind of weather, this is a great job.\" Kind of a deadend one, I would have thought, but on a beautiful clear day in October in a lovely town like Lawrenceton, with an interesting scene to watch, the idea didn\u0027t seem so terrible.\n \"Who do you like best?\" I asked idly.\n \"Oh, the writer.\" Tracy\u0027s face, already high-colored, flushed a deeper red. \"I\u0027ve read everything Robin\u0027s ever written. I\u0027ve got first editions of every book, all signed.\"\n She sounded like an ardent reader to me. \"He\u0027s good,\" I agreed, trying not to smile.\n \"I saw you talking to him yesterday,\" Tracy said. \"You known him long?\"\n \"Yes, several years,\" I said. \"Of course, Robin lived here at the time of the murders, and so did I.\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t be ... you couldn\u0027t be ... Aurora Teagarden?\" She looked absolutely dazed.\n \"Yes, I am,\" I said, trying not to flinch.\n \"OhmiGod, this is amazing,\" she shrieked. \"To actually meet you!\"\n Oh, boy. High time to haul ass out of there, I figured. I finished my cup of juice, thanked Tracy, and tossed my cup into the large, lined garbage can, brimming over with identical cups and napkins and paper plates. Tracy immediately bundled up the contents, secured the bag with a twisty, and tossed it into the back of the catering van. By the time I went to say good-bye to Carolina and Angel, she had already relined the can and bundled her dirty coat and some dish towels into the van as well.\n The two friends were still on the porch. They\u0027d laid claim to the lawn chairs, and people who moved in and out of the makeup trailers had to work around them. Carolina was on her second or third cigarette, and she was telling Angel something between puffs. Angel was listening with some intensity. I was a little shy about interrupting, even though all I wanted to do was tell Angel I was leaving, so I looked around me, trying to look like I was content rather than impatient.\n I was surprised to see Meredith Askew tripping along in my direction. She was smiling, a sort of conciliatory wincing lifting of the lips.\n \"Ms. Teagarden,\" she said while she was still a few feet away. \"Celia told me last night that if you showed up today, she hoped you would come talk to her a second.\" She came to a halt below the porch.\n \"You\u0027re her messenger, now?\" I asked, noting that my voice was appropriately cool.\n Meredith\u0027s smile might have twitched a little, but she kept her composure up. \"Just doing a friend a favor,\" she said, her voice level. \"Celia would like to apologize for her... for last night.\"\n Over Meredith\u0027s head I could see Barrett going into Celia\u0027s trailer. He\u0027d knocked while he stood on the top step, and if he\u0027d gotten an answer I hadn\u0027t been able to hear it from where I stood, maybe eighteen feet away. He looked puzzled, knocked again. He cracked the door, called \"Celia?\" loudly enough for me to hear. He opened the door and stepped in, his face troubled.\n I was just congratulating myself on Barrett\u0027s not noticing me when he stumbled right back out of Celia\u0027s trailer, his hand over his mouth. When I saw Barrett, I lost track of the conversations going on around me. I know trouble when I see it.\n I glanced around the set, hoping someone else would come to Barrett\u0027s aid; he was so obviously sick, and something terrible had so obviously happened. I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that told me I wouldn\u0027t be getting to work on time today. As I watched, Barrett groped his way to the end of the trailer and bent over, one hand supporting himself against the side, retching.\n For a second of blazing anger, I wondered if all these people weren\u0027t acting as though they hadn\u0027t seen Barrett. For all their attention to each other and their jobs, not one person appeared to have registered that there was a problem.\n I went down the steps, bypassed Meredith, and approached my stepson warily. \"What\u0027s happened?\" I asked him.\n He didn\u0027t seem surprised to see me, or angry, so I knew with even more surety that something was very wrong.\n \"She\u0027s dead in there,\" he gasped, and he began heaving again.\n \"Celia ... is dead?\" I could hear my own voice sharpen and rise with incredulity. I started to say, \"Are you sure?\" but then I realized that was pretty damn insulting.\n \"Go get Joel,\" he moaned.\n I wondered if my stepson thought the director could actually bring his leading lady back to life.\n \"I\u0027ll get him,\" Carolina said from behind me. \"I know where he is.\"\n \"What did he say?\" I heard Meredith ask her. \"What did Barrett say?\"\n I moved over to the open door of the trailer and peeked in. I didn\u0027t even put my foot on the concrete block that served as a step.\n Celia was half-lying on the couch, up against one wall. The stack of books - including some library books - and the manuscript were tossed around her feet, which were flat on the floor. A dark red throw cushion, stained and nasty, lay on the couch beside her. Her tongue protruded a little from her mouth. It looked bruised, as well. There was a big dent in her forehead.\n The Emmy was on the couch beside her. Its base was not clean.\n Celia was definitely deceased. Feeling quite wobbly myself, I shut the door and leaned my back against it. I didn\u0027t want anyone else to see what I\u0027d seen.\n \"What is it, Roe?\" Angel had loped over and was looking at me quizzically. \"Don\u0027t tell me she\u0027s dead. That\u0027s what Barrett keeps saying.\" Angel really, really didn\u0027t want anything to be wrong, but there was no help for it. I had to tell her.\n Carolina returned. \"He\u0027s on the way,\" she reported.\n \"You might want to call a doctor. Did the crew bring one?\" I asked. She shook her head and her heavy earrings, too many to count, swayed as her head moved. Carolina\u0027s skull gleamed dully in the early-morning sun as she pulled a cell phone out of her pocket. It was the thinnest cell phone I\u0027d ever seen. She dialed 911 as I watched. While she was speaking to the dispatcher who answered, Joel Park Brooks suddenly appeared in front of me as if he\u0027d been expelled from another dimension. Mark Chesney was dogging his heels.\n \"What\u0027s this you say?\" he asked, mad as hell at me.\n In a cowardly way, I nodded my head toward Barrett.\n \"Oh my God, Joel,\" Barrett said weakly. He\u0027d dropped to his knees and was pressing his face with both hands as if to force the grief out of it. \"Celia is dead. She died some awful way.\"\n As if I were a fly, Joel Park Brooks took me by the shoulder and shoved me aside. Before I could stop him, he flung open the trailer door. Leaping up the step into the trailer, he bent over Celia. Meredith and Mark were peering through the door, too. Both of them stood with one hand pressed against the door frame, on opposite sides. Altogether, the movie people were doing a great job of destroying evidence.\n And I heard the voice I\u0027d been dreading to hear, Robin\u0027s.\n \"What\u0027s wrong, Roe?\" he asked.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I said, almost whispering. I wanted to be a hundred miles away.\n \"What\u0027s happened?\" Robin\u0027s voice got louder as his fear mounted.\n \"She\u0027s dead,\" Barrett said. \"I can\u0027t believe it, but she\u0027s dead. We spent last night together, and now she\u0027s dead.\"\n \"What did you say?\" Robin bellowed, and I crouched down.\n \"We...\" All of a sudden, Barrett seemed to realize that this was neither the time nor the place nor the best choice of confidant. \"Forget it, man,\" he muttered, but there were many ears clustering around by that point, including mine, and if Barrett had truly wanted to keep this intimate knowledge to himself, it was too late by thirty seconds.\n That helped me pull myself together more than anything.\n I moved over to my stepson, and laid my hand on his arm. He looked at me, too distraught to be hostile. \"Barrett,\" I said, as quietly and earnestly as I could, \"don\u0027t say anything else. Everyone is listening. The police will be here soon.\"\n \"An ambulance,\" he began, and then closed his mouth with a snap.\n \"We called 911. But it\u0027s not gonna do her any good, and you know it. That woman was killed,\" I told him, keeping my voice even and low.\n \"Murdered?\" he said, way too loud. I could see cell phones spring up right, left, and sideways.\n \"Quiet, Barrett. Yes, she was murdered. I\u0027d keep my mouth shut, if I were you.\"\n Anger flashed across his handsome face, followed by intense thought. Barrett was certainly good at projecting his changing emotions.\n \"What did you say?\" Robin was standing to Barrett\u0027s side, his fists clenched.\n \"I was just talking. Ignore me.\" Barrett turned to walk away.\n As if I weren\u0027t there, Robin spun Barrett around and clamped both his hands on Barrett\u0027s shoulders. Barrett was younger than Robin by around fifteen years, but he was shorter, and Robin had a pretty good grip. I was going to have to believe Robin hadn\u0027t disengaged from his affair with Celia as much as he\u0027d thought.\n The movie people on the set were milling around, and I could hear sirens coming closer. But everyone there seemed to see his or her role as that of spectator, rather than participant. Robin opened his mouth to yell at Barrett, and Barrett\u0027s eyes ignited with anger, and I cast around for someone to help me.\n Of course! Angel Youngblood met my eyes and moved behind Barrett, while I got behind Robin and circled him with my arms and pulled. Someone behind me actually laughed, and I resolved to track down who that was and kick him in the shins. I know I am small, and I know Robin is tall, but I was not in the mood for amusement.\n Robin actually struggled for a minute, but I clung like a barnacle, and when he realized who it was had ahold of him, he relaxed. Blocked by his body from seeing what progress Angel had made with Barrett, I pulled gently on Robin\u0027s arms to get him to take a few steps away. He came willingly, and I could see that the anger had drained out of him. Robin wrapped his long arms around me and pulled me close, bowing his head over mine and crying.\n For once I wished I were taller. I would put his face in the hollow of my neck and let him cry there, concealed, if only I could. I stood on tiptoes to let him lean on me more comfortably, and I patted his back. I wondered if I had any tissues in my purse, a soft mesh shoulder bag that was now banging uncomfortably on my bottom.\n Will Weir was sitting on the curb of the sidewalk, his head buried in his hands. Meredith Askew was slumped by him, her makeup a mess, her hair all tangled. She was sitting as close to Will as she could get without climbing in his lap. Joel Park Brooks began shrieking at someone a few yards away. I recognized his voice, though I couldn\u0027t see him for the cloud of people, all chattering away on their phones.\n \"Hang up the damn cell phone,\" he screamed, and a Motorola whizzed past me. Then a wafer-thin red phone. Everyone moved back in a hurry to protect their property from the director\u0027s hands, and there was a flurry of clicks as people hid their cells. I glimpsed Carolina sliding hers down the front of her tee shirt. Unless I missed my bet, Joel Park Brooks would be in no hurry to go after that one.\n \"Robin,\" I said, hesitating to break into his grief.\n He lifted his head and looked down at me. I reached up to rub a tear off his face. \"She was so fragile,\" he said. \"She was such a mess.\"\n Not \"I loved her,\" or \"What will I do without her?\"\n I pushed my glasses back on my nose and eyed him doubtfully.\n \"I\u0027m really sorry, Robin, but the police are here. We need to find somewhere for you to wait, because they\u0027re going to want to talk to you.\"\n \"Did you say,\" he began slowly, disregarding what I\u0027d told him, \"did you say Celia had been murdered?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, yes.\"\n He looked baffled. \"But that doesn\u0027t make any sense,\" he said.\n It seemed like a strange comment. But just as I opened my mouth to ask him what he\u0027d meant, I heard a familiar voice.\n And the day got even worse. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-scene-alive-aurora-teagarden-7/page-5.html","bookId":2242,"book":{"id":2242,"title":"Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #7) \n Aurora Teagarden has never forgotten her first case: a serial killer who terrorized suburban Lawrencetown.
