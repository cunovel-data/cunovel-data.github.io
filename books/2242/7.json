{"id":84817,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"There was a hand holding mine. It felt comfortable; long, thin, fingers twined through my short ones. I opened my eyes to see Robin in front of me, sitting on the ottoman that matched the chair.\\n\\n \"Was I snoring?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"No, actually. Just sitting there like you were resting your eyes for a minute.\"\\n\\n I pushed my glasses up with one finger. \"Where\u0027s An-gel?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s out spraying a wasp nest. What an energetic woman. If I were left alone in this house, I\u0027d head for the bookshelves.\" The shelves I\u0027d had put in all up and down the hall were my favorite feature, too.\\n\\n \"Angel\u0027s not much one for reading,\" I said. \"You\u0027re welcome to go to the shelves if you want. How come you\u0027re here? I\u0027m glad you are,\" I added hastily, not wanting to be rude, \"but I\u0027m kind of surprised Arthur let you come.\"\\n\\n \"Luckily for me, I had an alibi for this morning.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"First, I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant at the same time as at least ten other people. It\u0027s quite the local watering hole, huh? Then, I was on the phone with my agent for thirty minutes. We were talking about this film, and the contract for my next two books. Then, after I got to the set, Joel grabbed me to discuss some dialogue changes. So I think I\u0027m pretty well covered.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s lucky for you. So Arthur said you could come out here?\"\\n\\n \"No, I just came out here on my own.\" There was a pause, not an uncomfortable one.\\n\\n \"Angel was telling me I should move,\" I said.\\n\\n \"How do you feel about that?\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking I was staying here because I had been happy here.\" I was still a little simple from my nap.\\n\\n \"And now you think?\"\\n\\n \"I think Angel is maybe right.\" I wiggled straight in the chair, untwisted my legs. I was too old to fall asleep in such a position without paying a penalty. \"I loved this house the moment I saw it, and I\u0027ve loved living in it. And I\u0027ve spent a mint on it. But now it just feels... empty.\" I made a face. \"Like I\u0027m not even here any more.\"\\n\\n \"Would you live somewhere else?\"\\n\\n \"You mean, leave Lawrenceton?\" I\u0027d wondered what would happen if Martin got transferred, so this wasn\u0027t a new idea. \"Not likely. Not if I don\u0027t have to.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027d look for another house in town?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Come to think of it, it was true that I could live anywhere in the world I wanted. I could live in England. I could travel to Italy. But that idea of moving out of my normal orbit scared the heck out of me. I was okay, right here in Lawrenceton. I knew who I was, here. And the time might be coming when my mother would need me; she never had, but it was always possible.\\n\\n I\u0027d always had the feeling I was a frill, rather than a necessity, for my mother.\\n\\n Robin was looking thoughtful, but not as traumatized as I\u0027d expected.\\n\\n \"Do you feel very bad?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice small and level. After all, his former companion had just been murdered, and she\u0027d spent the night with someone else before that, to boot. A punch in the stomach and a kick in the privates, all at the same time.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t feel like you\u0027d think,\" Robin said ambiguously. He took his hand back and raked it through his hair, which was long enough to get seriously rumpled.\\n\\n \"Oh? And how would I think you\u0027d feel?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d think I\u0027d feel like you did when you lost Martin.\"\\n\\n \"No, I wouldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because I really loved Martin, and you didn\u0027t love Celia.\" And then I closed my eyes and put my hand over my mouth, because I never should have said that.\\n\\n Robin didn\u0027t speak, and I opened my eyes just a sliver to take a peek at his face. He looked sad. He didn\u0027t look heartbroken.\\n\\n \"I guess not,\" he said, looking down at his hands, dangling between his knees. \"It was great for a while, but the last few months, I\u0027ve been feeling like she was keeping secrets from me.\"\\n\\n \"Secrets? What kind?\"\\n\\n Robin raised his eyebrows at me so I\u0027d elaborate.\\n\\n \"Like ... an \u0027I\u0027m pregnant\u0027 kind of secret, or an \u0027I know who stole the nuclear warhead,\u0027 or \u0027I was witness to a mob rubout\u0027?\"\\n\\n Robin almost smiled. \"I think it was more in the personal category.\"\\n\\n \"Did you notice anything different about her?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, as though he\u0027d just realized that. \"Yes, there was a lot different about her. Sometimes she seemed like she was staring into space, not even in the same dimension. Sometimes she\u0027d fall.\"\\n\\n I remembered seeing Celia stumble in the parking lot of Great Day.\\n\\n \"It was like she wasn\u0027t always in control of her own body. I suspected she was using drugs, for a while, but I\u0027d never seen a recreational drug affect anyone quite like that. And I never saw her using, never.\"\\n\\n Her hand flying out to graze Joel\u0027s cheek, her horrified face...\\n\\n \"So maybe she was ill. Maybe she did die of some natural cause?\" That would be great for those of us among the living. Though it sure hadn\u0027t looked natural to me. Could she have had some kind of fit?\\n\\n \"The police don\u0027t think so. But maybe they just have to act like it\u0027s a homicide, until they know different.\"\\n\\n \"Did you tell Arthur all this that we\u0027ve talked about?\"\\n\\n \"No, he was more interested in establishing where I\u0027d been all morning. He did tell me he wanted to talk to me again later, not to leave town. As if I would.\"\\n\\n I sat forward in my chair, preparatory to getting up to head to the bathroom. Not only did I need the facilities, I needed to rinse out my mouth and brush my hair. I had that sticky feeling I always get when I fall asleep in the daytime.\\n\\n \"Go pour yourself some tea,\" I said. \"I have to excuse myself for a minute.\" The downstairs bathroom didn\u0027t have a window, so I had to switch on the light to examine myself. I looked exactly like I\u0027d just woken from a nap: rumpled hair, smudged makeup, sticky mouth. Yuck. I cleaned up, polished my glasses, and felt much more alert when I joined Robin in the kitchen. Angel had come in, and the two were in conversation about Angel\u0027s previous movie experiences and Robin\u0027s loathing of Hollywood.\\n\\n \"I thought you loved it out there,\" I said, surprised.\\n\\n \"I did at first,\" he admitted. \"I liked being somebody to people I thought were important. I liked being a noteworthy person. Writers don\u0027t get that too much, even in Hollywood, where you\u0027d think they\u0027d be revered. Those beautiful faces have to have words to say, after all. When I first arrived out there, I had a desirable property - my unfinished book - that several studios wanted. At first a really famous actress had an option on it. She wanted to play you.\" He grimaced, an expression I really couldn\u0027t interpret. \"But then she went into rehab, and the option lapsed, and enthusiasm was cooling. The book actually came out, hit the best-seller list for a month, and interest built back up. A studio optioned it for one of its up-and-coming boy actors. They were going to beef up the role of Phillip.\"\\n\\n Phillip, my half-brother, had been staying with me when the murderer was arrested.\\n\\n \"Go on,\" I said.\\n\\n Robin looked weary, but he did offer me a little smile. \"Then the boy wonder backed out because he got a chance to do the new musical version of Treasure Island, and he wanted some stage credentials. In the meantime, the book went off the best-seller list, naturally. So, after all the hills and valleys, this production company optioned it for a made-for-cable miniseries, and hired Celia for it a few months before she won the Emmy.\"\\n\\n \"Was that when you met her?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, and wiped a big hand across his eyes. \"That was when I met her.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Angel said. I nodded.\\n\\n \"Like I said,\" Robin told us, visibly pulling himself together, \"it was really over. There was a lot to admire in Celia, a lot of talent, but she also had a full measure of the selfishness actresses sometimes have. And there was definitely something going on with her these past few weeks.\"\\n\\n \"Someone coming,\" Angel said.\\n\\n Then I heard the crunch of the gravel as a car made its way up the driveway.\\n\\n Arthur was here, as he\u0027d said earlier. I sighed. I just couldn\u0027t help it. I wondered how Lynn, his ex, was doing, raising their little girl. I\u0027d heard Arthur took the child every chance he got, but still...\\n\\n By the time Arthur knocked on the front door, Angel was making some coffee and I\u0027d put some cookies on a plate. It was my attempt to soften the edges of an official visit. It didn\u0027t work, of course. Arthur was glad of the coffee, turned down a cookie with a pat of his waistline to explain the refusal, and got immediately down to business.\\n\\n Angel and I went over our morning in detail, including approximate times and whom we\u0027d seen and when we\u0027d seen them. Arthur was particularly interested in my account of who I\u0027d noticed at Celia\u0027s trailer door, but I pointed out that I hadn\u0027t been watching every second, and I\u0027d only observed the door for maybe ten minutes. You had to figure that the murder had happened after Will, Mark, and the unknown woman (Arthur thought she must be a sort of sub-assistant director named Sarah Feathers) had spoken to Celia. That would have been while Angel and I were talking to Carolina.\\n\\n \"That Tracy girl who works for Molly\u0027s Moveable Feasts had as good a view of the door as I did, and for far longer,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yeah, but her attention was constantly distracted by people coming up and wanting juice, coffee, a pastry, to pass the time of day ...\"\\n\\n I nodded. I could believe that.\\n\\n Arthur wrote everything down and asked me and Angel a million questions. Robin sat silently and listened. Just when I thought we must be through, he said, \"Do you live out here alone, Roe?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think that\u0027s a good idea?\"\\n\\n I could feel my eyebrows draw together in a frown. \"If I weren\u0027t comfortable with it, I wouldn\u0027t do it, Arthur,\" I said, in a final tone.\\n\\n Because I\u0027m short, some people think I\u0027m helpless, or feeble, or silly. Arthur had known me for years; Arthur had even told me he loved me on more than one occasion. Why he would love a woman who would live in a place that terrified her when she had adequate means to move, I don\u0027t know, but he had that little smile that made me nuts. Patronizing.\\n\\n \"Do you really think you\u0027re safe out here?\" he asked, trying ever so hard to sound gentle.\\n\\n \"Hell, Arthur, I\u0027ve got a security system that\u0027s hooked up to the police department switchboard!\" I could feel my face getting hot. Arthur had an amazing ability to make me angry. I was not about to tell him that this very day I had made up my mind to move.\\n\\n \"Okay, okay!\" He held up a hand, palm outward, placatingly. \"But for a woman alone, living in town is safer.\"\\n\\n Much more of this, and I\u0027d feel the steam coming out of my ears. \"If you\u0027ve gotten all you need from Angel and me ...\" I said, making sure there was a nudge in my voice.\\n\\n \"I ought to be going, too,\" Robin said. \"They may need me back at the motel. I\u0027m sure Joel is having a meeting this afternoon to decide what to do.\"\\n\\n \"I have to pick up Joan at the sitter\u0027s,\" Angel said apologetically. \"Roe, would you like to come back to town with me? Spend the evening?\"\\n\\n There was no way in hell I was going to admit I wanted to be with someone, not while Arthur was standing there looking sorry for me. \"I have a lot to catch up on here,\" I said, keeping my face calm as a pond. \"Thanks for visiting, Robin. I\u0027ll talk to you later, Angel. Tell me when you need me to take you to pick up your car.\" Angel patted me on the shoulder. She\u0027d asked Robin for a ride back into town, and he\u0027d seemed glad to oblige. If I\u0027d been him, I wouldn\u0027t have been too enthusiastic about getting back to the motel to face Joel Park Brooks, either.\\n\\n To my dismay, somehow Arthur managed to linger while Angel and Robin left.\\n\\n \"How is Lorna?\" I asked brightly, fishing the little girl\u0027s name out of my memory with a desperate yank.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s great,\" Arthur said, his eyes focused on my face. Not too many people look at you so directly, but Arthur had always been a forceful and direct man. Except when he\u0027d been dating me, and sleeping with Lynn Liggett. And asking her to marry him, when she was pregnant. Except for that. \"She\u0027s in the first grade.\"\\n\\n \"Oh gosh,\" I said, the impact of the years that had gone by hitting me between the eyes. I remembered how jealous Martin had been of Arthur, when he found Arthur pursuing me after Arthur divorced Lynn. All that emotional energy, wasted.\\n\\n \"Yes, I know.\" Arthur laughed a little. \"They\u0027ve moved into Atlanta. Lynn wanted to put Lorna into a private school, so she took a job with a big company that installs security systems for businesses. She\u0027s pulling in the big bucks.\"\\n\\n \"How often do you manage to see Lorna?\" I was struggling to keep the conversation going.\\n\\n \"I have her two weekends a month,\" Arthur said. \"And some holidays.\"\\n\\n \"Did you remarry?\" I asked, all too aware that my voice was too bright and social.\\n\\n \"You know damn good and well I didn\u0027t,\" he said. He didn\u0027t sound angry - -just as if he were dusting off my pretense of ignorance. \"You would have known. I\u0027ve dated a lot, come close to being that serious once.\"\\n\\n I automatically wanted to know who the close call had been, but that wasn\u0027t something I could ask.\\n\\n \"How are you recovering?\" he asked.\\n\\n I bit my lower lip and looked down at the hardwood floor. \"I\u0027m probably doing better than I thought I would,\" I said.\\n\\n \"That sounds pretty uncertain.\"\\n\\n I considered that. \"I thought I\u0027d really collapse,\" I said. \"Then I thought I was just being brave for a while and I\u0027d collapse after that. But I guess I won\u0027t ever.\"\\n\\n \"You seem surprised.\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \"He never was...\" Arthur began, and I held up a warning hand. There was a long silence.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m leaving,\" Arthur said. He rose wearily from the couch, ran a hand over his pale hair. \"Do you... would you like someone to stay out here at night with you?\"\\n\\n \"You offering?\" I was trying to get a little lightness into the conversation.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d do it in a minute,\" he said flatly, and I was sorry I\u0027d spoken.\\n\\n \"Thanks, but I\u0027m used to being by myself at night.\" I did appreciate his thinking of my feelings. But the habit of turning Arthur away had gotten so strong I couldn\u0027t break it, and it would really be bad for me to begin asking someone to spend the night at the house to keep me company - not to mention what it\u0027d do to my reputation, though I was pleased to find that consideration was strictly secondary.\\n\\n \"If you need me, you call,\" Arthur said. \"But I know I make you rattled.\" He looked resigned to that. \"There\u0027s someone who\u0027d love to stay out here with you, and she needs money, if a paying situation would be more comfortable for you. The new young patrolwoman is just panting to meet you. She\u0027d be glad to keep you company, especially if there was money involved.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, she\u0027s on the poor side?\" Why on earth would anyone want to meet me? Oh... the movie. Someday, I\u0027d quit being completely naive.\\n\\n \"Her husband ran up all their credit cards as high as he could before he left,\" Arthur said, carefully showing no expression.\\n\\n \"He ran off with someone?\"\\n\\n \"Her stepbrother.\"\\n\\n I let that soak in for a minute, until I was sure I had understood Arthur correctly. \"I guess my own problems aren\u0027t too bad,\" I muttered, and Arthur nodded.\\n\\n \"That does put your life in perspective,\" he agreed. \"Plus, the SOB took their car.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one of the worst stories I\u0027ve ever heard,\" I said after I\u0027d thought it over.\\n\\n \"Tell me about it. So, if you want Susan to stay with you, give me a call.\" Arthur patted me on the shoulder, walked across the front porch, and opened the screen door. \"And call me if you think of anything about this morning, or about last night. Anything that might have happened while you were having dinner with the movie people.\"\\n\\n \"I will,\" I said, feeling sure I\u0027d already told Arthur everything that could have a bearing on the murder of Celia Shaw.\\n\\n I stood in the living room, all alone, and looked at the clock on the table. Amazingly, it was only noon. Equally amazingly, I was due at work.\\n\\n Breakfast (two pieces of toast) had been an eon ago. I got some chicken salad out of the refrigerator and ate it out of the bowl, with crackers to scoop it up. I was glad I had a job where I was due, glad something had broken into the dreary pattern of my life...\\n\\n Where had that come from?\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t glad Celia was dead, was I?\\n\\n No, not really. I was just glad something had happened to change things, jolt me out of my misery, cause people to treat me as something other than pitiful.\\n\\n Because I wasn\u0027t, I told myself crisply. I was not pitiful, and I was not just a forlorn rich widow. I was no tragic figure to be wrapped in cotton batting, either. I was a kick-butt rich widow. I began to feel better and better as I cleared away the cracker crumbs and the glass, and by the time I got in my car to go back to town, I was in a mood to take on a grizzly.\\n\\n No one looking at my four-eleven exterior could tell I was loaded for bear, and it was a considerable surprise to Lillian and Perry when I told Janie Finstermeyer that her son had way too many overdue books, that it was getting to be a real habit of his, and that she\u0027d better energize him into getting to the library with those books before the day was over or we\u0027d yank his card.\\n\\n I turned away from the telephone to find them staring at me as if I\u0027d dyed my hair green.\\n\\n \"Can we even do that?\" Lillian asked.\\n\\n \"You just watch me.\" But it wasn\u0027t necessary to put the threat to the test, because Josh Finstermeyer flew into the library as if propelled within an hour, money in hand and an apology on his lips. He even took his baseball cap off in the library.\\n\\n I tried to be equally gracious. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-scene-alive-aurora-teagarden-7/page-7.html","bookId":2242,"book":{"id":2242,"title":"Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden #7)","description":"Storyline: Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #7) \\n Aurora Teagarden has never forgotten her first case: a serial killer who terrorized suburban Lawrencetown.
