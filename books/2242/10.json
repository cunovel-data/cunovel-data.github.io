{"id":84820,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"I was changing my clothes when the phone rang. Almost without looking at my caller ID, I was sure my mother was on the other end of the line.\n \"Where were you last night?\" she said, considerably agitated.\n \"I spent the night with a friend,\" I said with commendable restraint. \"Now I have about fifteen minutes to get to work.\"\n \"A friend? Who?\"\n I let the silence hang.\n \"Oh,\" she said slowly. \"That kind of friend.\"\n More silence.\n \"Oh, sorry. Well, that\u0027s just... I didn\u0027t mean to intrude. I just wanted to make sure you\u0027re okay.\" I could practically hear the questions seething over the line. I was proud of Mother\u0027s self-control.\n \"I\u0027m fine, thank you.\" In fact, more than fine. I was relaxed and mellow to an extent I could hardly believe. Except for the discomfort when I walked. Or sat. Or crouched.\n I picked through my sweaters, looking for a turtleneck. Surely it was cool enough to make a turtleneck not unreasonable? I glanced into the full-length mirror on the closet door. Definitely needed the turtleneck. \"Oh, Mom, I need to look for a house in town and put this one on the market.\"\n Quite a silence on the other end. \"Aren\u0027t you rushing into this?\"\n \"I\u0027m not rushing. I had already decided to move back into town.\" The last thing in the world I needed today was to have to defend myself to my mother.\n There may have been a little edge in my tone, because she immediately said she\u0027d list the house that very day. \"Who would you like to be your realtor?\" she asked, keeping her voice scrupulously neutral. I\u0027d had Eileen Norris the last time I\u0027d been house hunting, but I had a better idea this morning.\n \"Why, the head honcho, of course.\"\n \"Really? You think we can gee and haw together?\"\n \"Sure. After all, this is your area of expertise.\"\n \"Well, tell me what you want, and I\u0027ll line some things up.\"\n \"I have no idea.\" I tried not to wonder if Robin really meant to stick around in Lawrenceton, if he planned to buy a house or rent, should I be thinking of getting a house that would hold another person - and his books. No, no point in thinking of that. Jumping the gun, for sure. \"I guess I want a three-bedroom, but I need a room for a library, and a dining room, and a living room. And you know how I feel about plenty of kitchen counter space. On the other hand, I don\u0027t want much yard to take care of.\"\n \"Your house is ready to show, I\u0027ll bet,\" Mother said.\n \"Yes. Isn\u0027t that scary? All I\u0027d have to do is pick up the floor of my closet.\"\n \"I\u0027ll list it today,\" she promised. \"I hope this is the start of a new era for you, honey.\"\n \"I guess it is,\" I said, after turning that over in my mind. \"I think it is.\" We discussed the price I should set on my house and what I was willing to spend on my next one. I was once again grateful for my financial health. The independence it afforded me was absolutely blissful.\n \"What\u0027s your work schedule like the rest of the week?\" my mother asked.\n \"I work this morning, but I\u0027m free this afternoon.\"\n \"Let me see what I can line up by then.\"\n \"Wow. So quickly?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t get where I am by letting my feet drag,\" she said.\n \"Okay. I\u0027ll come by Select when I get off work.\"\n \"Good, I\u0027ll see you then.\"\n The movie crew had resumed its activity at the courthouse this morning. I could tell from the traffic snarls in the area. Robin had said they would be shooting the scenes that didn\u0027t include Celia\u0027s character, until the recasting of the role was accomplished. He didn\u0027t expect that to take long.\n I glimpsed the Molly\u0027s Moveable Feasts van parked a block away from the courthouse, and saw the familiar table set up further down the street. A man was in charge of it today. I wondered where Tracy had gone, and what she had wanted with me the day before. I could feel my cheeks burn as I thought of what had followed the little scene in the library. Just when you think you know yourself... well, it had been the most fun I\u0027d had in a long, long year.\n \"Patricia,\" I said, trying not to sound disgustingly cheerful. \"How are you today?\" She was taking the cover off her computer and making little preliminary movements of things on her desk. Her pencil had to be just so, her little magnetic bowl of paper clips in a specific location, her chair exactly the right height.\n \"Just fine, thank you, Ms. Teagarden,\" Patricia said in a clipped voice. \"What do you think the police are up to, with Celia Shaw\u0027s death?\"\n \"I have no idea. I haven\u0027t talked to anyone in the police department since the day it happened.\"\n She looked disappointed. \"Oh,\" she said. \"I understood you were a particular friend of Detective Smith\u0027s.\"\n \"No, that\u0027s not correct.\" I could do clipped, too. \"As far as I know, they could be coming to arrest you any minute.\"\n My mildly belligerent comment had an amazing result. Patricia Bledsoe stared at me as though I\u0027d grown a second head. She turned absolutely green.\n \"What do you mean?\" she said, her voice faltering.\n \"I was just, ah, emphasizing how little I know about the investigation,\" I said, convinced I\u0027d gone over a line somehow. I felt knee-high to a grasshopper. \"Patricia! You, of all people ... I mean, I bet you iron your underwear.\"\n Patricia looked at me with loathing. \"Go work,\" she said.\n She\u0027d crossed the boundary into open rudeness in a great rush. What on earth had I done? I felt pretty truculent myself, by now. I couldn\u0027t think of anything to say that wouldn\u0027t escalate the hostility in the room, so I spun on my heel and left, my excellent mood stuffed in a sack for at least a little while.\n My boss, Sam derrick, came in the employee door as I was stuffing my purse into my little locker.\n \"Good morning, Roe,\" he said. His heavy glasses reflected the overhead light. He was carrying his briefcase, which was as much a part of Sam as his white shirt and tie. You\u0027d think he carried nuclear warhead firing codes in it instead of library paperwork.\n \"Watch out for Patricia today,\" I said.\n \"Something\u0027s wrong with Patricia?\" Sam was as protective of his prize secretary as if she\u0027d been a pedigreed bitch.\n \"She\u0027s a mite testy,\" I said, trying not to sound spiteful.\n \"Have you gone and upset her?\" Sam sounded calm, but I knew better. A good secretary, one who meshes perfectly with her boss\u0027s moods and personality, is worth rubies. Sam would much rather see me quit than lose Patricia.\n \"She went and upset herself,\" I said in my own defense.\n \"You obviously didn\u0027t know that the day Celia Shaw came in here and checked out some books, I gave Ms. Shaw a brief tour of the library,\" Sam said.\n Oh, I bet that had just made Celia\u0027s day. \"I\u0027m sure she enjoyed it,\" I muttered.\n \"And she met Patricia then, shook hands with her,\" Sam went on. \"So naturally Patricia is upset by the news of Ms. Shaw\u0027s murder.\"\n \"I see that I shouldn\u0027t have brought it up,\" I said, and that was the truth.\n Casting me a hostile look, Sam stomped into Patricia\u0027s cubicle. I could see him saying soothing things through the clear upper panels.\n So much for senior employee loyalty, I told myself, now just as frazzled as Patricia. I\u0027d been working for the library for ten years or more, and Patricia had been here less than a year.\n I stomped out to the main desk, emotionally loaded for bear. Luckily for my coworkers, about ten minutes after the library opened, the heavier of the two ladies who worked at Flower Fantasies brought in a beautiful flower arrangement and carefully set it on the desk in front of me, as I was beginning to telephone the people who had overdue books. Chrysanthemums, daisies, and other flowers I couldn\u0027t identify mixed in a medley of warm colors against their dark green background.\n \"It\u0027s for me?\" How long had it been since anyone had sent me flowers?\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" the woman said, beaming at my pleasure. \"First order of the day.\"\n I took the card out of the little plastic prongs and opened the envelope.\n \"You are beyond beautiful,\" the card said. It was signed \"Robin.\"\n I didn\u0027t melt on the spot, but it was a near thing. Tears welled in my eyes, which I kept very wide open.\n \"It\u0027s lovely,\" I said. \"Thank you.\"\n \"Enjoy,\" she said, waving a casual hand, and returned to her van, parked illegally outside the main library doors.\n I held the card to my chest like a schoolgirl, while I beamed at the arrangement. If Robin had planned a blitz attack on my body and heart, he was going about it exactly right. I could only be glad he\u0027d decided to proceed with his campaign.\n After the freezing-cold misery of the last year, I had the feeling I was sitting by a warm fire. That glow lasted all morning, with the exception of the few minutes it took to roust a reporter who came into the library to ask me how it felt to have been murdered by proxy, so to speak. Sam took care of him pretty quickly, and I was grateful.\n The incident did set me to thinking back to that morning at the courthouse. I recalled sitting in the sun, waiting for Angel. I watched Will speak to Celia, shove the door shut with one hand while he carried a cup of coffee in the other. I watched Mark knock at the door in vain. Had Celia been angry with him? Had she already had the drugged coffee, begun feeling drowsy? Had she just been in the bathroom and unable to come to the door? Then the woman - Sarah Feathers, Arthur had told me - just barely opening the trailer door and speaking a few words, shutting it again. Then I\u0027d lost a few minutes of surveillance while I talked to Carolina. Then I\u0027d gone to Tracy\u0027s table in front of the Molly\u0027s van, watched her change jackets, had the orange juice. All trivial stuff.\n I opened my eyes and focused on my flowers again. I\u0027d been standing there with my eyes shut while I thought, probably a bad habit to get into. For the first time, I wondered if Sarah Feathers had heard a reply from Celia to whatever she had said. I didn\u0027t know Sarah Feathers, and I couldn\u0027t ask her, but I knew who could.\n Sure enough, Angel had gotten Carolina\u0027s cell phone number.\n \"Hello!\" Carolina said, after two rings. I asked my question, and she said, \"I don\u0027t know why you want to know, but it\u0027s easy enough to find out. I see Sarah all the time.\"\n Carolina agreed to call me back that evening. I went back to calling patrons about overdue books.\n At noon, I trotted out of the employee door with my flowers held carefully in front of me. I was so busy planning how to place them in my car so they didn\u0027t fall over that I never saw the shadow behind me until it was too late.\n \"Roe! Roe! Are you all right?\" A silhouette was between me and the bright fall sun, right overhead.\n \"What happened?\" I asked, my voice weak and shaky.\n \"Someone ran up behind you and hit you,\" Perry Allison said. \"Someone in a coat with the hood pulled over his head, so I couldn\u0027t see who it was. I called the police on my cell phone. They\u0027re coming.\"\n \"My flowers,\" I said, and I began to cry. That was why I felt wet. My flowers were all around me on the pavement of the parking lot, and the water in the vase had soaked my pants.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Perry said. \"Are you hurt?\"\n \"I\u0027m okay,\" I said, trying to convince myself. A patrol car was turning into the library parking lot already, and a patrol officer I didn\u0027t know leaped out of it as though the car had an ejector seat. She was a small woman with short, dark hair, and she was already talking over her shoulder-rig thing.\n \"Which way did the assailant go?\" she asked Perry.\n Perry, trying not to gawk (he is a big fan of authoritative women) pointed in the direction of the heavily planted slope that divided the parking lot from the lower street. \"He went in the bushes after he pushed Roe down,\" Perry called to the officer\u0027s back.\n \"Wow,\" Perry said, deeply impressed.\n I sighed, glad I wasn\u0027t one of those self-centered people who think getting attacked is all about them. This was my day for people ruining \"Aurora\" moments.\n Perry looked back down at me, maybe hearing something exasperated in my exhalation. \"Can you sit up, Roe?\" he asked. He slid an arm underneath me and I was upright. I\u0027d never been this close to Perry before, and it felt funny. I would just as soon he let me handle this on my own, but there was no way I could say \"back off\" without sounding incredibly rude.\n \"This is good,\" I said, more or less to myself. My head felt fine. After a second or two of thinking about it and getting my breath back, I decided I wasn\u0027t really hurt, just astonished.\n The patrol officer came back through the bushes. \"I\u0027m afraid the assailant has escaped,\" she said seriously. \"There are other officers patrolling the area right now.\" I wondered if she always talked like that, or if she\u0027d acquired the habit since she joined the force.\n \"I\u0027d like to stand up if you would give me a hand,\" I said, giving Perry my right hand and extending my left to her.\n \"You sure you\u0027re okay for that?\" she asked. \"Did you hit your head?\"\n \"No, I took a spill when she shoved me,\" I said.\n \"She? This man,\" she inclined her head toward Perry, \"said your attacker was a \u0027he.\u0027 \"\n \"Why did I say that?\" I asked myself, while they pulled me to my feet. I thought it over. \"Perfume,\" I said.\n \"The person who pushed you had a on a woman\u0027s fragrance?\"\n \"Yes, officer,\" I said. \"But I didn\u0027t see her coming at all. She just ran up behind and pushed me down and I dropped my flowers.\" Embarrassingly, I began crying again.\n \"Who were they from, Roe?\" Perry asked, probably hoping I\u0027d stop with the waterworks.\n \"Robin,\" I sobbed.\n \"Way to go,\" he said. \"I\u0027m Perry Allison,\" he added to the patrolwoman.\n \"Uh-huh. Susan Crawford.\"\n \"Pleasure to meet you.\"\n \"How you doing, Miss?\"\n \"Thank you, I\u0027m okay.\" I was still drizzling tears, but physically I felt all right. \"I\u0027m Aurora Teagarden.\"\n \"You are?\" Now she was fully engaged. I looked up into her face, and realized that Patrol Officer Susan Crawford must be the young woman Arthur had told me about, the new officer whose husband had left her. \"I\u0027ve wanted to meet you for ages,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s under these circumstances.\"\n She pulled off her dark glasses, and I saw her eyes were clear and gray. She wasn\u0027t wearing a speck of makeup, and she looked just fine. \"Thanks for coming so quickly,\" I said, not really sure how to proceed. \"What do we do now?\"\n \"I\u0027ll write up a report,\" she said. \"Mr. Allison, how was the assailant clothed?\"\n \"What?\" he asked, as if he\u0027d been jogged out of a daydream. \"Well, this man - or woman - was wearing a hunter green coat with a zipper in the front and one of those hoods you can drawstring shut right around your face. He had on gloves and gray sweat pants, I think.\"\n \"Thank you. Is this your place of employment?\"\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" Perry said. \"Any time you need me, I\u0027m right here.\"\n \"I\u0027ll bear that in mind.\" She wrote a few lines in a notebook, talked into her radio, and then began to look around the parking lot, which was not very large to start with. Perry and I began picking up the scattered remnants of my arrangement, and I began inwardly gathering myself back together. After all, the flowers could be rearranged. My clothes needed changing, that was all. I wasn\u0027t even hurt to any appreciable extent; bruises and scrapes only.\n The attack had been malicious rather than harmful.\n I half-expected Arthur to show up. Any time anything had happened to me in the past few years, he\u0027d been there immediately. A police detective has no great problem keeping tabs on someone. But Arthur was a no-show, and I was really relieved. Sally walked down from the newspaper office (she had a scanner on, full-time) and took the incident as casually as I could have hoped.\n I left in my car after I\u0027d talked to the humorless Officer Crawford again. I stopped by the florist, where I explained I\u0027d dropped the arrangement, and could she be an angel and reconstruct it? At my cost, of course.\n She would be an angel, she agreed. And within the hour.\n I ran out to my house and changed, searching out my only other turtleneck. Luckily, it was cream colored and I could wear it with anything. Anything, today, turned out to be forest green pants. I pitched the soiled clothes into the washer. This was no time to abandon my ultraclean habits, considering my mother had left a message on my answering machine to tell me she\u0027d be showing my house at three in the afternoon.\n Quick work, even for Mother.\n My face was bruised, as I discovered when I went to the mirror to brush my hair. Apparently I hadn\u0027t quite been able to stop myself from banging the pavement. Well, my hands had been full, and I hadn\u0027t thrown them up in time. It could have been much worse. What if my attacker had had a knife?\n A thought skittered across my mind, and returned to take a deeper look out of my eyes.\n Robin\u0027s last girlfriend was lying on a slab in Atlanta.\n Robin\u0027s current girlfriend - and I guess that would be me - had just been shoved down in a public parking lot in broad daylight.\n The two incidents weren\u0027t exactly comparable, were they? Still... food for thought.\n Robin called the library before I got off work to ask if he could come out to the house. I appreciated him not assuming he could show up, and I said I\u0027d be glad to see him. Which was true. But I would\u0027ve been more glad if I could\u0027ve seen him somewhere else.\n I was still uneasy at having another man out to the house I\u0027d shared with Martin. Surely that was natural? And I could tell my mother was debating whether I was moving because of Robin\u0027s reappearance in Lawrenceton. That would be nuts, I knew. Robin said he wasn\u0027t leaving town when the movie shoot was finished, but men said a lot of things under the sway of lust. My experience with Arthur had taught me nothing, if not that.\n I wasn\u0027t moving because of Robin, I assured myself. I was moving because I was ready to rejoin life. And if that life included Robin right now, so much the better.\n I was carrying the arrangement when I got out of my car, and he came over to me to help.\n \"They\u0027re beautiful,\" I said. \"Thank you so much.\"\n A little awkward, he bent to kiss me, his hands full with the bowl of flowers. The minute his lips met mine, I felt a sort of solar flare. It was unexpected and violent, and I thought the damn flowers would end up on the ground again.\n When we broke for air, I took a deep breath.\n \"This seems, I don\u0027t know, a little precipitous,\" I said.\n Robin\u0027s eyes were shut behind his glasses. He was breathing raggedly.\n \"Feels good, though,\" he said.\n \"You\u0027re coming off a relationship and a loss, I\u0027m coming off a relationship and a loss,\" I pointed out. My relationship, and my loss, had been far greater, but he knew that already. We walked over to the house.\n \"What happened to your face?\" Robin said. It was dark already, and I\u0027d just disarmed the security and flicked on the kitchen lights.\n \"Does it look very bad? I\u0027ve been dodging mirrors since noon,\" I said. My fingers anxiously patted the darkened area. I trotted to the downstairs bathroom, Robin at my heels. I leaned across the sink, my glasses folded on the counter, and peered at my right cheek. Not too bad - a dark center and a lighter ring of bruising. It would be gone in a week.\n \"You want to tell me what happened?\" Robin asked.\n It crossed my mind that Robin had not expected me to call him about this. He was waiting for me to tell him - not angry at not knowing already. This was a different reaction from the one to which I\u0027d grown accustomed. Robin definitely approached life differently from Martin, and his expectations were different, too. I shook my head at myself. I should not compare.\n \"You don\u0027t want to tell me?\" His voice sounded mildly teasing, nothing more. But I could tell from the way he stood that he was more serious, now.\n \"Someone ran up behind me in the library parking lot and pushed me down. The flowers were in my hands, and I couldn\u0027t drop them fast enough - I didn\u0027t want to drop them - so I kind of hit the pavement hard.\"\n \"Someone attacked you?\" Robin was quite rightly astonished. \"In the library parking lot?\"\n \"Yeah. Strange, huh? Right out in daylight.\"\n \"The police didn\u0027t catch him?\"\n \"Or her. No, the police didn\u0027t.\"\n \"Why \u0027her\u0027?\" Robin\u0027s face was involved in thought, suddenly. I could practically see the lightbulb over his head.\n \"I thought I smelled perfume.\" I eyed him. \"Does this ring some kind of bell with you?\"\n Robin looked profoundly embarrassed. \"Ah, maybe.\" He did everything but look up at the ceiling and whistle. \"But I ... maybe if I went and talked to her. ... I hate to say anything unless I\u0027m sure.\"\n \"That\u0027s what people in mysteries say right before they get killed. \u0027Yes, I think I know the killer, but I have to check a few things before I talk to the police.\u0027 Next scene, they\u0027re toast.\"\n Robin was struck by this observation, which as a mystery writer should have occurred to him first. \"That\u0027s true,\" he murmured. We\u0027d drifted from the bathroom into the kitchen, and I\u0027d gotten out a pitcher of tea. He nodded when I lifted it, a question on my face.\n \"Okay, well. This is really... there\u0027s this girl. She...\" Robin turned a dark red. He took a big swallow of tea. \"She has this big thing about me. Like a superfan. She took this job to be...\" Robin was overwhelmed with chagrin, shook his head speechlessly. Hollywood had not made him completely egocentric, I thought, smiling at him.\n \"She\u0027s nuts about you?\" I suggested.\n He nodded morosely. \"You know how I found out about Celia and Barrett spending the night together? I knew already when I came to the trailer. I got an anonymous note. I\u0027m about ninety percent sure it was from her.\"\n I began to put two and two together, myself. \"Tracy,\" I said. \"Tracy, from the Molly\u0027s Moveable Feasts catering company.\"\n \"Yep.\" Robin finished his tea in one long gulp.\n I thought this over. \"Did you tell the police about Tracy?\" I asked.\n \"No,\" he said, horror written all over his face. \"This isn\u0027t exactly something I want to talk about, Roe.\"\n \"Robin, didn\u0027t you consider the fact that the woman murdered was your girlfriend?\"\n \"Former,\" he corrected. He looked at me almost angrily. \"Of course, Roe. What are you... ?\" His face cleared. \"Oh.\"\n I saw the tide of realization pour over him. \"Oh, no,\" he said. \"Oh, no.\"\n \"I hope not,\" I told him. \"But you have to say something.\"\n He fumed and fussed, but he was just postponing the inevitable. \"You think she may have attacked you today, too?\" he asked, as he pulled his coat back on to drive to the police station.\n I shrugged. I remembered Tracy\u0027s face, after (I now realized) she had seen Robin and me together in the library, obviously close, obviously in lust. I wondered what would have happened if I hadn\u0027t pulled out of the parking lot, if I\u0027d waited to talk to her as she\u0027d wanted.\n I was really glad I hadn\u0027t stopped to find out. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-scene-alive-aurora-teagarden-7/page-10.html","bookId":2242,"book":{"id":2242,"title":"Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #7) \n Aurora Teagarden has never forgotten her first case: a serial killer who terrorized suburban Lawrencetown.
