{"id":84813,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I didn\u0027t have to work that Thursday, so I didn\u0027t get up until about seven-thirty. Catherine Quick, the maid, was supposed to be coming in that afternoon, so I didn\u0027t have to make my bed; she\u0027d be changing the sheets. I trotted down the stairs to put on the coffeepot, and I popped an English muffin in the toaster before I went to the living room at the front of the house to look out. Though the air was chilly that morning, making me glad I\u0027d pulled on jeans and a sweater before I came downstairs, it was going to warm up and be a beautiful day. The air was crystal clear, the sky so blue it almost sparkled. I told myself I wouldn\u0027t worry that day, wouldn\u0027t think about the movie at all. Maybe I would call Sally Allison to see if she could have lunch with me. Since she was a reporter, Sally always knew what was going on in Lawrenceton. The kitchen had two doors, the back one opening onto our patio, and the side one opening under the covered walkway leading to the garage. Madeleine\u0027s cat flap was in the patio door, and she made an entrance just about this time every morning, tired from her night\u0027s adventures and ready to eat her kibble. But this morning, though I filled her bowl and renewed her water, she didn\u0027t show. Maybe I\u0027d see her when I went down the long driveway to fetch my newspaper. I opened the side door and made a noise somewhere between a gasp and a shriek. The young man sitting on the steps jumped up, dumping Madeleine off his lap in the process. \"Hello, Aurora,\" he said, and in that moment I recognized him. \"Hello, Barrett,\" I said, trying hard not to sound as anxious and angry as I felt. It was all I could do not to blurt out, \"What do you want?\" At six feet, Barrett was tall enough to cow me, and of course he was fit, since looking good was part of his stock in trade. His hair was a new color, a dark blond, and he was wearing glasses he didn\u0027t need. It\u0027s an accurate measure of our relationship that I wondered, just in a flash, if Barrett had come disguised so no one would recognize him in the police lineup after my body was discovered. \"I didn\u0027t know you were in Lawrenceton,\" I said, my voice much more shaky than I liked. \"Oh, yes. And I came to see you first thing, Stepmom.\" So it was going to be that way. As if it had ever been any other way. \"Barrett, what are you doing here?\" I was not stable enough emotionally to put up with all this parrying. \"Just wanted to come check in on you, see how you were enjoying my dad\u0027s money,\" he said casually. The actor. I wondered how often he\u0027d rehearsed tossing that line over to me. I sighed. I considered several responses, most based on my new policy of rudeness, but a sudden deep exhaustion quenched anything I might have said. \"Frankly, Barrett, I don\u0027t enjoy much of anything.\" My voice was as weary as I felt. It was time to speak plainly, and end this if it was possible. I stepped back and said, \"Come in, if you have to, and say whatever you have to say. I\u0027m sorry we misunderstood each other so badly after your father died. I just wasn\u0027t at my most intelligent or sensitive.\" Barrett\u0027s face was already arranged to say something witty and cruel. But there was a subtle shift in his expression as he listened. He nearly relented, but at the last second his grievance settled back on his shoulders like a cape. \"Did your lawyer tell you to say that?\" he sneered. I could think of no response. \"Do you want some coffee? Have you had breakfast yet?\" When in doubt, fall back on being a lady, as my mother had always advised me - though truly, it would feel better to kick Barrett in the butt. Once again, Mother was proved right. Barrett had no idea how to pose himself. \"I\u0027d like a cup of coffee,\" he said after an appreciable pause. \"I take it black.\" He looked around the kitchen with almost palpable surprise. What had he expected - marble countertops and a resident chef? It was just an ordinary kitchen. I got another cup from the cabinet and buttered my English muffin, which had popped up. \"So, what are you doing here in Lawrenceton?\" I asked. \"I guess you came to visit your dad\u0027s grave? I got the headstone in about four months ago. It looks real nice.\" I took a deep breath, trying unsuccessfully to repress the tears that welled up. I grabbed a tissue and blotted my eyes. I glanced over at my stepson as I put his coffee on the table, to surprise a look of shame on his face. \"You didn\u0027t even think of going out to the cemetery,\" I said out loud. I was truly stunned. \"He\u0027s not really there,\" Barrett said, scrambling for a defense. He sat down at the table and looked sullen. \"No, of course not,\" I said numbly. I put half my muffin in front of Barrett. \"And I know I shouldn\u0027t have spent so much time out there at first, but somehow you just want to be close ... I know that\u0027s stupid.\" I shook my head. I could feel the trembles and weepies looming, like unpleasant relatives due for a visit. Barrett was staring at me like he\u0027d never seen me before. He took a sip of his coffee. \"You\u0027ve lost weight,\" he said at last. I shrugged. \"Maybe a little.\" It was my turn to drink some coffee. My eyes ached with tears. But this, too, would pass. \"I suppose your check got to you all right?\" Martin\u0027s will had finally been probated; of course, money was at the root of Barrett\u0027s rancor. \"Yes,\" he said. The silence dragged uncomfortably. \"I\u0027m sorry, again, about the - about the misunderstanding after Martin died.\" \"No,\" said Barrett sharply. \"Let\u0027s not talk about that.\" Which was fine with me. In the turmoil after Martin\u0027s death, I had simply forgotten that Martin\u0027s adult son had been in the habit of receiving handouts from Martin when acting jobs proved few and far between. For one thing, the largesse had been irregular; Martin had always thought it would be an insult to give Barrett a steady allowance, as though Barrett were still a child. So he waited until Barrett called and hinted that he needed a \"loan,\" and then Martin would mail a check. Once I\u0027d become aware of this practice, I\u0027d bitten my tongue to prevent myself commenting. Most importantly, it was none of my business. I had my own money, and Martin\u0027s checks to Barrett had not deprived me of anything at all. But in my opinion, if Martin thought it right to support an adult son, he should have made it a regular arrangement, so Barrett wouldn\u0027t have to ask. My lips were sealed even more tightly because Barrett loathed me and always had. He\u0027d dodged coming to our wedding, at family functions he never addressed me directly if he could avoid it, he\u0027d only visited Lawrenceton when I was out of town, and he\u0027d made it insultingly clear (out of his dad\u0027s hearing) that he thought I was marrying Martin for his money. So in the months immediately after my husband\u0027s funeral, Barrett\u0027s financial state had been the last thing on my mind. But one night Barrett had called me, when he\u0027d held out as long as he could for his legacy. Probate often takes much longer than it has any right to, and in the case of Martin\u0027s estate, which was a little complicated because of his diverse holdings - real estate, stock, insurance payments, and the retirement fund of Pan-Am Agra - well, settling Martin\u0027s affairs was a drawn-out process. That night, Barrett had stiffly demanded I mail him the money he was accustomed to getting. I hadn\u0027t reacted well. I could tell how difficult it was for Barrett to call, but in my view, he should have been man enough to manage on his own rather than phone me. At the same time, I admit I was aware that Barrett must truly have his back to the wall financially to be driven to such a measure. But I was just too mired in my personal hell to care about Barrett\u0027s problems. He could have helped me in many ways when Martin had died - just being civil would have been a good way to start - and he had chosen not to do so. Now, I chose not to help him. I\u0027d told him so, frankly and at length, being unable to think beyond the moment and see this from any other angle than the one in front of my face. The next day I\u0027d woken up sorry, but not because I hadn\u0027t solved Barrett\u0027s financial problems. I\u0027d been sorry because Martin had loved Barrett, and would have wanted me to send the money - no matter what it said about Barrett that he\u0027d even asked me for it. So without calling or writing a note to enclose, I\u0027d FedExed Barrett a check - my own money - for what he\u0027d needed. I\u0027d never heard a word from him after that, until this moment. I\u0027d sent him his share of Martin\u0027s estate when it had all been settled. I had not deducted what I\u0027d already given him. That would have been businesslike, but he would have taken it as petty. I just didn\u0027t want to struggle with Barrett any more. So here we were, not talking about the incident that lay between us, as big and smelly as a dead fish. I cleared my throat and asked after his mother and aunt. Cindy\u0027s florist shop was doing well, Barrett said. In fact, Cindy and her partner were expanding the shop to include gifts and home-decorating items. \"They took out a loan,\" Barrett made a point of telling me, I guess so I\u0027d realize he couldn\u0027t have turned to his mother for money. \"She and Dennis plan to get married.\" \"I\u0027m glad for them,\" I said, not caring one little bit. \"Aunt Barby has been keeping Regina\u0027s baby for a week or two, while Regina and her husband are on vacation in New York.\" While I was indifferent about Cindy, I actively disliked Martin\u0027s sister Barby and her daughter Regina, who was on her second marriage. I was confident that Regina would someday be on her fourth. Probably she would have had a few more babies along the way. \"Why didn\u0027t you and Dad have any children?\" Barrett asked me. The question came from out of the blue and lodged in my heart. \"I can\u0027t have children,\" I said. \"We talked about it a little, before we found out that I had some fertility problems. I sure wanted a baby, and sometimes he did too. But he was a little wary of starting a new family at his age.\" I saw Martin, so clearly, leaning over Regina\u0027s baby when I\u0027d placed him beside Martin on our bed. Tears trickled down my cheeks. I lowered my face and wiped it with a napkin. \"Can I get you some more coffee?\" I asked politely. \"No, thank you. I need to be getting back.\" Barrett and I both stood up. He scrabbled through his pockets for the car keys, and looked uncertain, not a normal Barrett state of mind. He looked as though he were going to make some kind of pronouncement, but in the end, all he said was, \"Thanks for the coffee.\" It wasn\u0027t until I watched his car turn onto the county road that I realized he\u0027d never told me why he was in Lawrenceton. It didn\u0027t take long for the other shoe to drop. While I was upstairs covering up the circles under my eyes and brushing my hair, it suddenly occurred to me that Barrett was in town because he had a part in the movie. I couldn\u0027t imagine why I hadn\u0027t made the connection earlier. He would be a natural choice for the cast, as the stepson of one of the real-life figures in our local drama. He\u0027d even visited Lawrenceton before, when I\u0027d been gone with my mother to a real estate convention in Orlando. I collapsed ungracefully on the delicate peach-colored chair in the corner of the bedroom and further considered this likelihood. Barrett was an up-and-coming actor, whose longest running part had been on a popular soap. I think he played a seductive chauffeur. Since I never watch daytime television, I\u0027d never seen him in it - which, now that I came to examine my conduct, was just as much stubbornness as his refusing to come to our wedding - but several women who knew of our connection had told me how good he was. They\u0027d had their tongues hanging out as they said it, too. I wondered what role Barrett would have. I wondered, for the first time, what the script was like; how close the movie would come to the reality. I wished I hadn\u0027t hung up on Robin Crusoe. Moved by an impulse I didn\u0027t even want to analyze, I decided to go shopping that morning. My friend Amina Day\u0027s mother owned a women\u0027s clothing store called Great Day. If I bought anything in Lawrenceton, rather than going to my favorite store in Atlanta, I bought it at Great Day. To my pleasure, Mrs. Day had a younger partner now, and the selection had really improved as a result. I had a closet full of good clothes already, but I needed something new, some voice deep within me advised. My coloring - brown hair, brown eyes, fair complexion - was pretty neutral, so my color field was wide open. As Barrett had noticed, I\u0027d lost weight I\u0027d never regained when Martin died, so my involuntarily smaller size was another excuse for shopping. As I got out of my car at the strip mall that housed Great Day, a cluster of people emerged from the Crafts Consortium next door. Homemade quilts, candles, and all kinds of \"country\" stuff formed the bulk of the store\u0027s goods, and crowds were not something I\u0027d ever seen there. The center of the group seemed to be a short, thin, very young woman with artistically disheveled blond hair who was wearing the highest heels I\u0027d ever seen on a woman who wasn\u0027t standing on a street corner. And these high heels were worn with jeans, the tightest jeans I\u0027d ever seen. No, wait; Nadine Gortner had worn some just as tight to one of the Pan-Am Agra picnics, and her zipper had popped. As if the heels and jeans weren\u0027t enough to mark her out, this woman had lips outlined in the darkest possible shade of red while the lipstick she\u0027d filled in with was a creamy pink. She looked like a bee had been at her. The people accompanying this creature were not as eye-popping, which was a relief. An older, grizzled man who might be from almost anywhere was carrying a bag (which I had to believe belonged to The Creature). A slightly less ornate woman in a modified version of The Creature\u0027s outfit was scrabbling in her outsize purse with fingernails like a Chinese emperor\u0027s. She pulled out some car keys, and immediately reached out to steady her flamboyant friend, who had stumbled on the irregular surface of the parking lot. No wonder, in those heels. After absorbing this trio in a comprehensive glance, I passed them with my eyes straight forward. That was why I noticed Miss Joe Nell standing in the glass door of Great Day making an elaborate face at me, jabbing her finger vehemently in the direction of the little group. It was hard to keep a steady course forward, since Amina\u0027s mom was doing her best to get me to stop, turn, and stare. \"That was them!\" she said excitedly, as soon as I came through the door. Miss Joe Nell and her partner, Mignon Derby, were flushed and practically panting. \"Them?\" I said, trying not to sound as irritated as I felt. \"The movie people!\" Without ever thinking that I might not be delighted to have come in close proximity with some \"movie people,\" the two women began speaking all at once. Miss Joe Nell and Mignon (who, at twenty-eight, had the kind of skin most women only dream of) were extremely revved up about the trio\u0027s just-concluded visit to Great Day, where the Starlet Lite (as opposed to the spike-heeled Full Starlet) had bought a white linen shell. \"I don\u0027t know what Celia Shaw bought at Crafts Consortium,\" Mignon babbled. \"I\u0027m gonna go call Teal and find out!\" So that had been Robin\u0027s girlfriend, at least according to the magazine article. I was almost proud for despising her before I had known. Then I was angry with myself for my lack of charity. This was not my day to be pleased with the way I conducted my life. I am not exactly poker-faced, so Miss Joe Nell was picking up on my lack of enthusiasm. \"Well, that was fun, but we know who\u0027s going to be around when the movie people are gone,\" she said, smiling. \"What can I show you today, Roe?\" Since I didn\u0027t know what I wanted, I felt even grumpier. I was rapidly getting to be the town killjoy. At that moment, I was sure I was the only person in Sparling County who wished everyone associated with the movie project would fall into a big hole. I calmed down as I shopped, the familiar ritual and the renewed attentiveness of Mignon and Miss Joe Nell combining to make me feel once again that I had a legitimate place in the world. Hmmm. Was I just full of sour grapes at not being Top Dog? Was I way too used to having people treat me with a little deference and a little extra attention because I was well-heeled and a widow? Just could be. A life unexamined is not a life lived, I reminded myself, and resolved to be a little less stuffy and a lot less grudging about the excitement the filmmaking was bringing to Lawrenceton. Maybe, despite my legitimate gripes about the movie\u0027s being made at all, what I was really doing was... pouting. Hmmm, indeed. I left with a nice bulky bag and lots of news about Amina, since Miss Joe Nell and her husband were just back from a trip to Dallas to see Hugh, Amina, and their two-year-old, Megan, who was being taught to call me Aunt Roe. Spending money always makes me feel better, so I drove to my lunch engagement with Sally Allison with a lighter heart. Sally was waiting in the foyer of the restaurant, wearing her usual solid colors - today she sported a bronze silk blouse under a tan pants suit - and groping in her huge shoulder bag. She pulled out a phone and dialed while I watched. Holding up a finger to let me know she\u0027d just be a minute, Sally told her adult son Perry to be sure to take his clothes by the cleaners that day. I raised my eyebrows, and Sally had the self-awareness to look a little embarrassed. \"Once a mother, always a mother,\" she said after she\u0027d hung up. \"Let\u0027s get in line, unless you want to call someone else?\" \"No, I\u0027ll turn it off during lunch,\" she said bravely, and pressed a button. \"When are you going to join the twenty-first century?\" \"I have a cell phone. I just don\u0027t turn it on unless I want to call someone.\" \"But... but... it\u0027s to use!\" \"Not if I don\u0027t want to,\" I said. Sally clearly loved her cell phone and, since she was a reporter, I could see that it would be a valuable tool for her. But to me, it was just a nuisance. I got too many phone calls as it was, without arranging for a way to get more. Sally told me all about Perry\u0027s new girlfriend as we moved down the line. I got my tray from the stack, and my silverware, and ordered ice tea and beef tips over rice. I got my number and looked for a free table while Sally ordered. Beef \u0027N More seemed quite crowded, and I wondered a little at that - but it was a popular place, especially with the noon business crowd. \"See, these are movie people,\" Sally hissed as she unloaded her tray and put her receipt faceup where the waitress could spot it when she brought our food. \"Isn\u0027t this something?\" Even Sally, the toughest woman I knew, was dizzy with excitement about the damn movie. I remembered my good resolutions, and I managed not to look sour. \"Where are they all staying?\" \"The Ramada out by the interstate, most of them,\" Sally said after she put down her little packet of sweetener and stirred the powder vigorously into her tea. \"That Celia Shaw has the Honeymoon Suite. But the director - -Joel Park Brooks - is renting Pinky Zelman\u0027s house. I hope Pinky\u0027s asking a lot of money, because I bet it won\u0027t be in any great shape when he moves out.\" Sally looked a little pleased, as if the prospect of writing a story about the director\u0027s damage to Dr. Pincus Zelman\u0027s house was a treat Sally had in store. Clearly, Sally was seeing stories, stories just lining up to be written. What a bonanza this was going to be for the Sentinel. \"Are you going to watch them filming?\" I asked. \"Every chance I get. And they\u0027ve hired me as a consultant.\" Sally flushed with pride. \"That makes sense. You did the best series of stories on the murders, after all.\" Those stories had nearly bumped Sally up to a bigger paper in a bigger city, but somehow it just hadn\u0027t happened. Now, Sally was in her late forties, and she no longer expected that someday she\u0027d leave Lawrenceton, as far as I could tell. \"Thanks, Roe.\" Sally looked pensive for a moment, her square, handsome face crumpling around the eyes and mouth. \"At least,\" she said, less cheerfully, \"now I can finally finish paying all Perry\u0027s hospital bills.\" \"That\u0027s great.\" For the last few years, Perry had been doing very well, but I knew the bills for his treatment had been staggering. Sally had been whittling away at this debt. \"Can we have a bill-burning, or some kind of celebration?\" \"I\u0027d love it, but it would make Perry feel bad,\" she said regretfully. \"He hates to be reminded of the cost of all that help I gave him. As if I grudged it. It was worth every penny.\" \"Did Perry pay for any of it?\" I regretted the question as soon as it left my lips. \"No, it was my bill, and I paid it,\" Sally said, after a moment\u0027s hesitation. \"And don\u0027t you say one word about it, Aurora. Perry\u0027s a young man; he doesn\u0027t need any burdens. He needed to put all his resources into the effort of getting well and staying well. And getting married!\" I clamped my mouth shut. After a moment, I asked Sally how her chef salad was. And that was the way it went the rest of the meal. We stayed superficial. In addition to Catherine\u0027s old car, there was a black Taurus parked in my driveway. The rental company must specialize in Tauruses. Tauri? Sitting on its gleaming hood was Robin Crusoe. I got out of my car slowly, uncertain about how I felt about seeing Robin again after all these years. I\u0027d forgotten how tall he was, at least six three. And he\u0027d filled out quite a bit. I remembered Robin as being weedy thin when he\u0027d lived in my mother\u0027s townhouse. His hair was as bright a red, and his mouth as quirky, and his nose was the same sharp beak. He was wearing dark glasses, which he whipped off and stuck in his pocket as I approached. He stood - and stood, and stood. I put the Great Day bag on the ground, and kept walking toward him, and he held out his arms. I walked right into them. I wrapped my own around him. Robin said, \"I didn\u0027t know if you\u0027d throw something at me or not.\" \"It was a toss-up,\" I admitted. I leaned back to look up at his face. \"I\u0027ve been brooding and pouting.\" He smiled down at me, and I smiled back. It was hard to resist smiling at Robin. \"How was L.A.?\" I asked. Robin\u0027s mobile face darkened and all of a sudden he seemed ten years older. \"Unbelievable,\" he said. \"I learned a lot. The thing is, I didn\u0027t want to know most of what I learned.\" \"You\u0027ll have to tell me all about it.\" I recalled his changed circumstances, his relationship with Celia Shaw. \"If you have any free time, that is.\" I released him and stepped back. \"Will you show me your house?\" \"Yes.\" I unlocked the door and punched in the security code. I half-expected Robin to say something about the security system, but he must have gotten accustomed to them while he lived on the West Coast. \"Catherine!\" I called. \"I\u0027m here with a friend.\" \"Hey, Roe,\" she called from upstairs. \"I\u0027m just about done.\" Robin looked at the bright kitchen, done in cream with orange touches, and went into the hall, admiring the built-in bookcases and the hardwood floors. The den, which was warm in dark blue and deep red, drew a compliment, and the dining room and living room got a nod. There was one smallish bedroom downstairs, and he glanced in its door. \"What\u0027s upstairs?\" he asked. \"Two bedrooms and a small room Martin kept his workout stuff in,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sorry, Roe,\" Robin said. I kept my gaze averted. \"Thanks,\" I said briefly. \"Would you like to see the patio? We added it on after we moved in, and I wonder sometimes if it wasn\u0027t a mistake.\" As I was about to open the kitchen door, the cat flap vibrated and Madeleine wriggled through. \"I\u0027ve never seen that fat a cat,\" Robin said, clearly impressed. \"Is this Madeleine?\" \"The one and only.\" I\u0027d inherited Madeleine after Robin left Lawrenceton, but I remembered writing him about the big orange cat. The patio forgotten, Robin bent to hold out his hand to Madeline. She glared at him after she sniffed it. Pointedly, she turned her back to him and waddled off to her food bowl. It was empty, and she sat in front of it with the air of someone who could wait all day. She would, too. I got out her kibble and filled her bowl. When food was in front of her Madeleine ignored the rest of the world, and she dove in as eagerly as usual. Catherine came downstairs, her feet heavy on the treads. Catherine was the most consistent \"help\" I\u0027d ever had. Mostly women came to work for me, showed up on time at first, and then drifted on to some other job. Sometimes they\u0027d tell me; sometimes they just wouldn\u0027t show up. Cleaning houses is not for everyone. It\u0027s not high-paying, at least in Lawrenceton, and some people seem to feel it\u0027s degrading. So I was grateful for Catherine\u0027s consistency, and I tried hard to be a good employer. \"I\u0027m fixing to leave,\" she said, after I\u0027d introduced her to Robin. \"You need to get some more Clorox and some more Bounce sheets. I put it on the list on the refrigerator.\" \"Thanks, Catherine,\" I said. \"See you next time.\" \"Okay.\" We were never going to be best friends, but at least our exchanges were always civil. After she\u0027d left, I poured some iced tea for Robin and we went into the study, den, downstairs room - I\u0027d called it all three. There was a red leather couch with its back to the window. Robin settled on that, so he\u0027d have plenty of room for his long legs. I had a low, comfortable armchair that allowed my feet to sit firmly on the floor. We looked at each other a little anxiously, not knowing what to say next. \"Are you very unhappy about the movie?\" he asked abruptly. \"I was. I\u0027m still not exactly thrilled.\" I took a deep breath, exhaled. I was making an effort to be honest, with a little tact thrown in. \"But the town is very excited, and the money will be good for its economy.\" Robin nodded, and seemed to want to change the subject. He started playing \"How is?\" and we went down a list of names rapidly. It was an unpleasant surprise to me to find how long it had been since I\u0027d seen some of the people Robin asked about. There seemed no excuse for it in a town the size of Lawrenceton. \"Tell me about your husband,\" Robin said out of the blue. I sat and stared at my hands for a minute. \"Martin was ... a senior executive at Pan-Am Agra,\" I said carefully. \"He was older than me by almost fifteen years. He was a Vietnam vet. He was very... dynamic. He had done some shady things in his life. He was always looking for that to come back at him.\" He loved me deeply. He was fantastic in bed. He was extremely competitive with other men. He was domineering even when he didn\u0027t think he was being so. He really listened to me. He broke my heart. I loved him very much, though our marriage had loose edges and rough patches. All this. \"I know you must have some hard times,\" Robin said quietly. \"My mother lost my dad earlier this year, and she\u0027s been struggling.\" I nodded. Hard times, indeed. \"I\u0027m sorry about your dad,\" I told him, and for a minute we sat in silence. \"Are you going to marry the actress?\" I asked brightly, trying to get us back on a less dangerous track. \"I saw you-all\u0027s picture in the magazine.\" \"You can\u0027t believe the stories about me and Celia,\" he said. \"At one time they had some truth to them, but not any more. We\u0027re just barely friends, now.\" I raised my eyebrows at him, making a skeptical face. He grinned. \"No, really. She\u0027s full of ambition, she\u0027s really young, and she\u0027s got different priorities. Since she won the Emmy, in fact... well, the only reason she\u0027s doing this project is because she\u0027d signed on for it prior to her win.\" He looked like a different man when he said this, older and harder. I gave his disenchantment a moment of respectful silence. Then I asked, \"So, what did you want from this visit to me?\" He must want something, I was sure. He paid me the compliment of not protesting he\u0027d just wanted to see me again. \"I want you to come to the set, at least once. I want you to see this being filmed, read the script.\" \"Why? Why on earth would you want that?\" \"Because I want you ... to approve. At least, not to hate it so much.\" \"Does it really matter to you?\" \"Yes.\" Robin was dead serious. For the life of me, I couldn\u0027t figure out why my approval made any difference at all. But what did I have to lose? I wasn\u0027t scheduled to work tomorrow until late afternoon. \"Okay, Robin.
