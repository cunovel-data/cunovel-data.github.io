{"id":84812,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"I looked up Celia Shaw on the Internet that night. My computer was less than two years old, bought by Martin so he could work at home from time to time. I\u0027d learned to use it, at least enough to send and receive email and to search for information. The games bored me, I\u0027d discovered, and my money was \"handled\" by my accountant, so I only turned the machine on a couple of times a week. Celia was supposed to be twenty-five, I learned, a figure I took with a grain of salt. She\u0027d been born in Wilmington, North Carolina, where her mother had been working in a movie. I hadn\u0027t realized there were movie studios in Wilmington but, according to the article, it was quite a moviemaking center. Well, back to Celia. Her mother, Linda Shaw, a middle-aged minor actress, had been so long separated from her husband that the baby\u0027s parentage was in doubt. Linda Shaw had left the infant Celia with an aunt and uncle, and fled. Linda resurfaced in California a couple of years later, dead. She\u0027d committed suicide in a motel - barbiturates and a razor combined. What a tragic beginning. Though my father had left when I was a teenager, my mother had been a rock. I\u0027d never had aunts and uncles, since both my parents were only children (which may have contributed to their problems), but my mother had a whole network of friends, family connections, and coworkers on whom to call. Having become more sympathetic to Celia Shaw, whom I\u0027d been quite prepared to dislike, I continued scrolling along. I examined pictures of Celia in various movies I\u0027d never seen. I paused to check out a dress Celia had worn to the Emmy Awards. Hmmm. I was more conservative sartorially than I\u0027d realized. I peered at the picture. Had she had to glue that bit into place? How had she planned to cope if she\u0027d dropped her purse? Of course, someone would\u0027ve picked it up for her gladly; Celia Shaw would never have to perform any little service for herself, at least not for the next ten years. Still, what if she\u0027d forgotten her posture and slumped a little.... Well, she had nerve, anyway. I\u0027d give her that. According to her bio, Celia Shaw had won escalating parts in five minor films and two major television shows. However, Whimsical Death, a two-part made-for-TV movie, would constitute her first leading role. Chip Brodnax was taking the role of Robin. His face was familiar to me, but I couldn\u0027t remember where I\u0027d seen him. I didn\u0027t watch a lot of television, but I was sure I\u0027d noticed him in something before. The same picture of Celia Shaw that had been in the magazine was on the website, the one of her with Robin at a party. There was another shot of Celia holding her Emmy. She was beautiful, no doubt about it. And even if her given age of twenty-five was literally less than the truth, there was no doubt in my mind that Celia Shaw was several years younger than me. As I closed down the computer and went upstairs for my bath, I wondered why I\u0027d bothered to search out this information. I told myself it was because she was going to play me - or someone at least as close to me as the movie could go, since I\u0027d refused permission for a character to have my name. Surely it wasn\u0027t too surprising that I\u0027d have an interest in the woman who was going to represent me? I attended Evening Prayer that Wednesday night. This was by no means my normal schedule, I\u0027m sorry to say. St. Stephen\u0027s saw me on Sunday mornings, but that was the limit of my church attendance, and I\u0027d dodged the altar guild, the vestry, and the annual Christmas bazaar committee with amazing agility. (I was beginning to have a slightly guilty feeling, as though I watched PBS every night yet didn\u0027t send in a dime at pledge time.) On this balmy evening, I scooted into an empty pew close to the back of the small church and let all my worries go while I moved through the ritual that meant so much to me. As I was about to shake Father Aubrey Scott\u0027s hand while I was going out the door, he said, \"Could you stay for a minute? I\u0027d like to have a few words.\" \"Sure,\" I said. I\u0027d always been fond of Aubrey. In fact, I\u0027d dated him for many months. Then I\u0027d met Martin and he\u0027d met Emily, and we\u0027d parted amiably. The warmth of a pleasant companionship remained. I rummaged through my mind for any recent hot topics in the congregation that he\u0027d need to discuss with me, but I couldn\u0027t come up with a one. With a sense of mild expectation, I settled on a bench in the quiet churchyard while the other congregants got in their cars and switched on their headlights in the gathering dusk. Soon we\u0027d have the time change. We\u0027d be leaving in the full dark. Through the lighted windows I could see Aubrey\u0027s wife, Emily, blond and suburban, moving around the church. She was raising kneelers that had been left down, picking up programs discarded in the pews, and turning out lights. Elizabeth, Emily\u0027s daughter by her deceased first husband, hadn\u0027t been in church that night. She\u0027d probably used homework to wriggle out of coming; Elizabeth, now ten, was quite a handful. But Aubrey never regretted adopting Elizabeth; he doted on her. Having divested himself of his robe, Aubrey came to sit beside me in the half-darkness. Aubrey was a lot grayer than he\u0027d been when he\u0027d first come to Lawrenceton to take the helm of St. Stephen\u0027s. Was Aubrey thirty-nine? Or closer to forty-two? I caught myself frowning: I was thinking about age far too often these days. \"I have something I need to ask you,\" Aubrey said, sounding very grave. \"Ask ahead,\" I told him. From the open church door came a thwack! as Emily raised the fourth kneeler from the back on the left, which was a little noisier than the others. \"Would it offend you if the movie company filmed some scenes here at the church?\" he asked. Whatever I\u0027d expected, it wasn\u0027t this request. I was glad of the darkness, since I had no idea what my face looked like. I couldn\u0027t think of what to say. \"The vestry met with the film company representative last night. The thing is,\" he continued, after a pause to offer me a chance to comment, \"they\u0027re offering enough in compensation to get a new roof put on St. Stephen\u0027s - both the parish hall and the church. But if you have the slightest objection, we\u0027ll forego the money. It won\u0027t be worth it. You\u0027re one of ours. The vote on that was unanimous.\" So many comments came to my lips that I compressed them together to lock the words inside. There was only one answer I could possibly give. \"Of course,\" I said. \"For a new roof, you have to say yes.\" I knew my voice was much cooler than I wanted it to be, and I knew my words weren\u0027t exactly enthusiastic or even very civil, but that was the best I could do. \"You don\u0027t sound okay about it,\" Aubrey said after a hesitation. \"You sound like you want me to go play in traffic.\" I smiled a little, a very little, but he couldn\u0027t see that. \"St. Stephen\u0027s is beautiful. I\u0027m not surprised they\u0027d like to use it as a set. Nothing will be changed?\" \"He promised not. He said everything would look just the same or better, since the film company will paint the sign on the corner for us.\" \"Then you\u0027d better do it.\" It crossed my mind that I could pay for the new church roof, all by myself, and then the film company could go whistle. But that would draw even more attention to me, and that was the one thing I didn\u0027t want. I made sure to exchange another comment or two with Aubrey, so he wouldn\u0027t think I was leaving angry. He\u0027d given me a choice and I\u0027d picked, so I couldn\u0027t take the result of my decision out on him. By the time Emily locked the door of the church, I was on my way to my car. Madeleine was waiting at the kitchen door when I got home. Madeleine, golden and fat and increasingly slow, was the living part of the legacy an old friend had left me. Jane had left me the cat and a pot of money. Guess which I liked best? Madeleine was known and feared by every vet in the Lawrenceton area. Fortunately, except for the effects of old age, the cat had always been healthy. Her annual checkups were traumatic for everyone involved. Though I\u0027d grown up without pets, thanks to a mother who thought having animal hair in your house was comparable to having lice, Madeleine and I had coexisted in reasonable harmony for several years now. I fed her, brushed her in the spring and summer, and scratched behind her ears. She ate the food, enjoyed the brushing, purred when I scratched her, and otherwise ignored me. It worked for us. I watched the huge old cat launch into her kitty chow with gusto. When that palled, I wandered across the hall into the den, admiring the way the wooden floors gleamed and the books marched in even rows in the built-in bookcases in the hall. The answering machine light was blinking by my telephone and for a minute or two I thought about checking my messages. Then I decided it didn\u0027t matter what other people wanted. Smiling a little, I hiked up the stairs, spent some time in the bathroom on my minimal grooming ritual, and climbed into my high four-poster. I had lots of pillows, a comfortable bed, and a good book. Martin hadn\u0027t really liked my reading in bed. To Martin, a bed was for sleeping in or making love on, not for reading or lolling of any kind. For the most part, I\u0027d read downstairs in the den while we were married. Now, this was one of the moments of the day to which I actually looked forward; and if it was raining outside or cold, or both, and I could swathe myself in blankets, so much the better. The night was mild outside my windows this evening, but as I pulled up the clean sheet I came as close as I could, these days, to being happy. I was reading a new C. J. Songer, too, an added bonus. Just when I was getting drowsy, the phone rang. I leaned forward to check my caller-ID device. I picked up the phone, already smiling. Angel said, \"I got a question to ask you.\" Angel and Shelby Youngblood were both very direct, Angel more so than her husband. Shelby, a Vietnam vet and one of the toughest men I\u0027d ever met, had learned to approach certain topics sideways rather than straight on, something I didn\u0027t think would ever occur to Angel. Their little girl Joan was going to have to be one sturdy kid. Already, at nearly a year old, Joan seemed more independent than most babies her age. At least Angel told me so. \"Shoot,\" I told her. \"You mind if I work this movie? I got a call from a guy who asked if I wanted to do stunts.\" Everyone, everyone, wanted to work for the damn movie. I had a moment\u0027s flash of intense resentment, an irrational conviction that all the people of Lawrenceton should shun the movie and the moviemakers, not rent or sell to them, not be employed by them, and all for my sake, because I didn\u0027t want this film made. \"Of course you ought to,\" I said calmly. \"I know it\u0027s been years since you got any stunt work, and you must miss it.\" \"Thanks,\" Angel said. She was so direct herself that it seldom occurred to her that people didn\u0027t exactly mean what they said. \"If you\u0027re sure. We\u0027re trying to save up for a swimming pool for Joan.\" \"Above ground?\" \"Nope, in-ground. So we got a ways to go.\" I silently exhaled. \"Well, you better get to it. Bye, Angel.\" \"See you soon, Roe.\" I thought it was the perfect cap to a perfect day. What could happen tomorrow, I asked myself rhetorically, that would make it any worse than today ? I should have known better than to ask myself any such a thing.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-scene-alive-aurora-teagarden-7/page-2.html","bookId":2242,"book":{"id":2242,"title":"Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden #7)","description":"Storyline: Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #7) Aurora Teagarden has never forgotten her first case: a serial killer who terrorized suburban Lawrencetown.
