{"id":27280,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER VII.","content":"The handle of the street door of Mr. Chester\u0027s house could be so worked from without by any person initiated into the secret that it yielded easily to practised fingers. This was Mr. Chester\u0027s ingenious invention. Early in his married life he had found it not agreeable to his sensitive feelings that, after a night\u0027s carouse, the door should be opened for him by his wife. Hence the device. \\n\\n \\n\\n At one o\u0027clock on this morning he opened his street door and entered his house. Mrs. Chester was still up, mending Sally\u0027s clothes. On a corner of the table at which she was working, his supper of bread-and-cheese was laid. As he entered, his wife glanced at him, and then bent her eyes to her work, without uttering a word. Receiving no favourable response to his weak smile, he fell-to upon his supper. \\n\\n \\n\\n By the time Mr. Chester had finished, the silence had become intolerable to him. His wife, having mended Sally\u0027s clothes, was now gathering them together. He made another conciliatory step. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How is Sally?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Chester\u0027s lip curled. \"Sally\u0027s asleep,\" she answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you get her any--any strengthening things?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No. All the shops were shut--except the public-houses.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, yes, I forgot. But you might have asked her if she fancied anything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I said to her last week,\" replied the mother, with a dark, fierce flash into her husband\u0027s face, \"when she came out of one of her faints, \u0027Sally, what would you like?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d like some gin, mother,\u0027 she answered. I was afraid she might give me the same answer again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He quailed before the look, and the strong reproach conveyed in the mother\u0027s words. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let\u0027s have any more quarrelling to-night, old woman,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want any quarrelling: I\u0027m not a match for you, Dick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s as it should be, old woman,\" he said, recovering his spirits. \"Man\u0027s the master.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re good at words, Dick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so,\" he chuckled vainfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But better at something else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At what, old woman?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With a scornful glance she laid before him the strap with which he was in the habit of striking her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s no arguing with a woman,\" he said, with rare discretion. \"Come, it\u0027s time to get to bed. I suppose the new lodger is in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He came in an hour ago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And the little girl?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s asleep with Sally.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Chester, who had risen, stood silent for a few moments, drumming gently with his fingers on the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you see him when he came home?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Chester\u0027s anger was spent, and her husband\u0027s kinder tone now met with a kindred response. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Dick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, then, there\u0027s no use asking. But you might have heard something, Loo.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What might I have heard, Dick?\" she asked, approaching close to his side. He passed his arms around her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Something that would have reminded you----\" He broke off abruptly with, \"No matter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But tell me, Dick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When I was at the Royal George I fancied I heard a man playing on a tin whistle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Chester\u0027s lips quivered, and a shudder ran through her frame. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The new tenant,\" pursued Mr. Chester, \"hang him! he\u0027s got into my head like a black fog!--the new tenant had just gone away, and good riddance to him, when I heard the music, as I thought, and I went to the door to look. I saw nobody, and a man in the Royal George said that our new lodger had something in his pocket that looked like a whistle or a flute. As he came straight home, I thought you might have heard him play it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was asleep, Dick, when he came home; the slamming of the street door woke me.\" She paused and played nervously with a button of her husband\u0027s coat. \"Dick, I dreamt of our Ned to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ay, Loo,\" he answered softly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What can have become of him? Where is he now, the dear lad?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Best for us not to know, perhaps,\" replied Mr. Chester gloomily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve thought of him a good deal lately,\" said Mrs. Chester; \"more than I\u0027ve done for a long time past. And my dreaming of him to-night is a good sign. Dick, I\u0027ve got it into my head that he\u0027ll open the door one day, as handsome as ever, and rich too, and that he\u0027ll make it up to us----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Chester interrupted her with a bitter laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If my head doesn\u0027t ache till then----There! Stop talking of him, and let\u0027s get to bed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They went into the bedroom together, and Mrs. Chester held the candle over the sleeping children, turning the coverlid down, so that their faces could be seen. They were both fast asleep: the baby\u0027s head was lying on Sally\u0027s bare shoulder, and their lips almost touched. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not upon Sally\u0027s face that Mr. Chester\u0027s eyes rested. He gazed intently upon the child sleeping in Sally\u0027s arms, much as though he were striving to find the solution of some perplexing problem. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s bothering you, Dick?\" asked Mrs. Chester. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The difference between this new child and the man upstairs,\" he replied. \"There\u0027s our Sally now. She\u0027s dark, and skinny, and queer-looking all round; but anybody can see with half an eye that she\u0027s our child. It\u0027s the same with Ned; he was about the handsomest lad that you could see in a mile\u0027s walk----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ay, that he was, Dick,\" said the fond mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"--Not a bit like Sal, and not much like us to speak of, in a general way. And yet nobody could doubt that they were brother and sister, and that he was our boy. Nature works out these things in her own way. Very well, then. In what way has Nature worked out a likeness between this new baby and the man sleeping upstairs?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In no way that I can see,\" replied Mrs. Chester, receiving with favour this evidence against a man to whom she had taken a dislike at first sight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There ain\u0027t a feature in their faces alike--not one. Nature doesn\u0027t tell lies as a rule; but she has told a whopper if that man is this young un\u0027s father. Do you mean to tell me that a father would behave to his own flesh and blood as that fellow behaved to this little one to-night? Look here, old woman. I go wrong more often than I go right. I might be a better man to you, I dare say, and a better father to Sal; but things have gone too far for me to alter. But for all that, I think I\u0027ve got the feelings of a father towards our lass, and I wouldn\u0027t part with her for her weight in gold.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Which speech, uttered with rough, genuine feeling, was a recompense to Mrs. Chester for months of neglect and unfair usage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Dick,\" she said, \"don\u0027t bother any more about it now. We\u0027ve got two weeks\u0027 rent in advance, at any rate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And this practical commentary Mrs. Chester considered a satisfactory termination to the conversation--at least, for the present. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Chester was a heavy sleeper. Being an earnest man, he was as earnest in his sleep as in other matters, and his wife had often observed that it would take the house on fire to rouse him. It was singular, therefore, that on this night he should wake up within an hour of his closing his eyes, with an idea in his mind which had not before presented itself in an intelligible shape. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say, old woman,\" he mumbled, \"are you awake?\" The instinct of habit caused Mrs. Chester to answer drowsily, \"Yes, Dick,\" and to instantly fall asleep again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rouse yourself.\" (Assisting her by a push.) \"What time was it you told me the new lodger came in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Under the impression that the question had been put to her many hours since, and therefore not quite clear as to its purport, Mrs. Chester said, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh, Dick?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh, Dick! and eh, Dick!\" retorted Mr. Chester. \"Now, then, are you listening?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I am,\" she said reproachfully, throwing upon him the onus of evading the question. \"Go on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going on. Slow.\" (With a pause between each word.) \"What--time --did--you--tell--me--that--the--new--lodger--came--in--to-night?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He came home about an hour before you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you were asleep?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and I\u0027m almost asleep now. That\u0027s enough for to-night, Dick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not half enough, old woman,\" he said, shaking her without mercy. \"If you were asleep, how do you know what time he came in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He woke me up,\" replied Mrs. Chester, goaded to desperation, \"with the way he slammed the door. I\u0027ll give him a bit of my mind in the morning. There\u0027s other lodgers in the house besides him, and I ain\u0027t going to have them disturbed in that way. I shouldn\u0027t wonder if some of \u0027em don\u0027t give us warning to-morrow. For the Lord\u0027s sake, don\u0027t talk to me any more! I\u0027ve got to be up at six o\u0027clock.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He proceeded, without paying the slightest regard to her appeal: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When the new lodger comes home a couple of hours ago, you are asleep. He wakes you up with the way he bangs the door. He comes into the house, and goes upstairs to his room. That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s it, Dick,\" replied Mrs. Chester listlessly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you don\u0027t set your eyes on him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, and don\u0027t want to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, old woman, just keep your mind on what I\u0027m saying--\" but here Mr. Chester interrupted himself by exclaiming, \"What\u0027s that row upstairs? It comes from his room.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The noise proceeded undoubtedly from the room let to the new lodger, and, as well as she could judge, was caused by the stealthy moving about of furniture. It did not last long and presently all was quiet again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall have to go up to him,\" said Mr. Chester, shaking his head at himself in the dark, \"if he gives us any more of that fun. He\u0027s a stranger in the neighbourhood. Not a soul in the Royal George ever set eyes on him before to-night. He comes here with a child--a mere baby--that don\u0027t seem as if it had any right to be here at all. He takes the room and pays a fortnight in advance, without ever asking for a receipt, and without ever saying his name is George, or Jim, or Jo or whatever else it might be. He pulls out a handful of money, too. Does this sound suspicious, or doesn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It does, as you put it,\" acquiesced Mrs. Chester, now awake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And, by Jove! there\u0027s something more suspicious behind. Who showed him his bedroom?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I didn\u0027t. Who showed him how to open the street-door without a key?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I didn\u0027t. Then how the devil does he open it without being shown how it is done? and how the devil does he find his way, without a light, to a room he\u0027s never seen? I\u0027m going to look into this, Loo, before I close my eyes again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Chester jumped out of bed energetically, with the intention of putting his purpose into execution. But if his determination of looking into the matter had not been formed by his own reasoning, it would have been forced upon him by what took place immediately his feet touched the floor. The moving of furniture in the new lodger\u0027s room recommenced--not stealthily now, but with great violence, and much as though it were being thrown about with the wilful intention of breaking it to pieces. The noise had aroused the other lodgers in the house, and a knocking at Mr. Chester\u0027s door, followed by a pathetic inquiry about that disturbance upstairs, and an entreaty that it should be stopped at once, as the speaker\u0027s old man had a racking headache and the row was driving him out of his mind, quickened Mr. Chester to speedier action. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, Mrs. Midge,\" Mr. Chester called out, \"I\u0027m going upstairs this minute. It\u0027s only a new lodger we\u0027ve taken in to-night. If he don\u0027t stop his row, I\u0027ll bundle him neck and crop into the street.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With the handle of the open door in his hand, he turned to his wife, and telling her not to be frightened, groped his way to the upper part of the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Chester, disregarding her husband\u0027s injunction sat up in bed, and listened to the noise, which so increased in violence every moment that she got out of bed before Mr. Chester was halfway upstairs, and stood ready to fly to his assistance. \\n\\n \\n\\n The person who was causing this commotion had, when he entered the bedroom, fallen upon the bed in a stupor. He had had no rest for a week, and was utterly exhausted. For days he had been haunted and pursued by horrible phantoms, which had driven him almost mad. When the fit first seized him, he was in the country, fifty miles from Rosemary Lane, and the thought occurred to him that there was but one house in all the wide world in which he could find refuge from his enemies. To this refuge he slowly made his way, eating nothing, but drinking whenever the opportunity for doing so presented itself. It gave him for the time a fictitious strength, and enabled him at length to reach Mr. Chester\u0027s house. \\n\\n \\n\\n The room was in total darkness, and for two hours he lay helpless and supine, unaware that even in his stupor he was ceaselessly picking unearthly reptiles from the blanket upon which he had fallen. For two hours he lay thus, and then consciousness returned to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n It slowly dawned upon his fevered imagination that he was no longer alone. The frightful shapes which had pursued him for a week had discovered his sanctuary, and were stealing upon him. They were subtle and powerful enough to force their way through stone walls, through closed doors, and they had done so now. Perhaps, thought he--if it can be said that he thought at all--if I keep my eyes closed, they will not discover me. It is dark, and I shall evade them. They will not think of searching too closely for me here. \\n\\n \\n\\n He lay still and quiet, as he believed, with loudly-beating heart; but all the time he struck at the air with his hands, helpless, impotent, terror-bound. Soon, encouraged by the silence, he ventured to open his eyes, and a spasm of despair escaped him as he discovered how he had been juggled. Creeping towards him stealthily was a huge shapeless shadow. Form it had none, its face and eyes were veiled, but he could see huge limbs moving within dark folds. The window and door were fast closed, and it could only have entered the room by way of the chimney and fireplace. If he could thrust it back to that aperture, and block it up, he would be safe. He rose from the bed, shaking and trembling like a leaf in a strong wind, and moved the common washstand between himself and the shadow. Pushing it before him, he whispered triumphantly to himself as he perceived his enemy retreat. Cunningly he drove it towards the fireplace and compelled it into that niche, where it passed away like the passing of a cloud. Thank God! it was gone. And so that it should not again find entrance, he placed against the fireplace all the available furniture in the room. That being done, he lay down upon the bed, with a sense of inexpressible relief. \\n\\n \\n\\n But peace was not for him. Within five minutes the shadows began again to gather about him, and the same monstrous shape which had previously threatened him reappeared. Not now in disguise, or veiled. He saw its limbs, its horrible face and eyes, and its aspect was so appalling that a smothered shriek of agony broke from his parched lips. Whither should he fly? How could he escape these terrors? Ah! the door! He moved towards it, but shrank back immediately at the sound of steps and muffled voices. The window! but that was blocked up by a crawling monster, whose thousand limbs were winding and curling towards him, warning him to approach at his peril. He dared not move a step in that direction. In what direction, then, could he find a refuge? In none. He was hemmed in, surrounded by these fearful enemies; the room was filled with them, and they were waiting for him outside. In mad desperation he seized a chair and hurled it at the approaching shapes; with a terrible strength he raised the heavier furniture, and strove to crush them. In vain. There was no escape for him. Closer and closer they approached; their hot breath, their glaring eyes were eating into his soul, were setting his heart on fire. And at that moment Mr. Chester, who had stopped on his way, to obtain a lighted candle, opened the door and appeared on the threshold. \\n\\n \\n\\n The candle which Mr. Chester held above his head as he opened the door threw a lurid glow around his fearful form. In a paroxysm of blind delirium the furious wretch threw himself upon his arch enemy. The candle fell to the ground and was extinguished. But the madman needed no light to guide him. He would kill this monster who came to destroy him; he would squeeze the breath out of him; he would tear him limb from limb. He raised Mr. Chester in his arms as though he were a reed, and dashed him on to the bed. He knelt upon him, and struck at him with wild force, and pressed his hands upon his throat, with murderous intent. Mr. Chester was as a child in his grasp--powerless to defend himself, powerless to escape, only able, at intervals, to scream for help. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sounds of this terrible struggle aroused the whole house, and every person leaped from bed, the most courageous among them running to ascertain the cause of the disturbance. Mrs. Chester was the first to reach the room. She had no candle, but she saw enough to convince her that her husband\u0027s life was in danger. She threw herself upon the delirious man, and added her affrighted shrieks to the confusion. The lodgers came hurrying up, and their candles cast a light upon the scene. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Mrs. Chester saw clearly before her--saw the distorted face of the man who was striving to strangle her husband--saw in his hand a tin whistle, with which, deeming it to be a dagger, he was stabbing at the form writhing in his grasp. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O God!\" she shrieked. \"It is Ned--my boy Ned! Ned--Ned! for the love of God, come off! Are you blind or mad? It is your father you are killing!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her words fell upon heedless ears. So strung to a dangerous tension was his tortured imagination, that the entreating voices, the lights, the hands about him striving to frustrate his deadly purpose, were unheard, unseen, unfelt. \\n\\n \\n\\n The men grappled with him, but their united efforts were unavailing; their blows had no more effect upon him than falling rain. Thus the terrible struggle continued. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ned--Ned!\" cried Mrs. Chester again, forcing her face between him and the object of his fury, so that, haply, he might recognise her, \"for gracious God\u0027s sake, take your hands away! Your mother is speaking to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The lines in his forehead deepened--the mole on his temple became suffused with blood--the cruel, frenzied expression on his face grew darker and stronger. He dashed her aside with a curse, and, had it not been that one of the bystanders pulled her out of reach of his arm, he would have left his mark upon her. \\n\\n \\n\\n But as her son turned from her, the struggle came to an end, without being brought to this happier pass by the force of either words or blows. Simply by the appearance of a little child. In this wise: \\n\\n \\n\\n The conversation that had taken place between husband and wife in Mrs. Chester\u0027s bedroom had awakened Sally and her baby-treasure. Sally did not move when her father went out of the room, but when, alarmed by his cries for help, her mother followed him, Sally got out of bed, and lifted her baby treasure to the ground. Hand in hand, they crept to the top of the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n They reached the room in which the struggle was taking place--and reached it just in time. Another minute, and it might have been fatally too late. \\n\\n \\n\\n The grown-up persons were too intently engrossed in the action of the terrible scene to observe the entrance of the children, and thus it was that they made their way to the bedside. At this precise moment it was that Ned, the lovely lad, flung his mother from him with brutal force, and that his eyes met those of Sally\u0027s baby-treasure, who was gazing upon him with a look of curious terror. \\n\\n \\n\\n Her white dress, her beautiful face, her blue eyes staring fixedly at him, her golden hair hanging around her pretty head, produced a powerful and singular effect upon him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The horrible shapes by which he had been pursued faded from his sight, and something sweeter took their place. The dark blood deserted his face, and the furious fire died out of his soul, leaving him once more pale, haggard and degraded, and weak as trickling water. \\n\\n \\n\\n With shaking limbs he fell upon his knees before the baby-child, and placed his trembling hands upon her shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The men and women in the room were spell-bound, not daring to interpose between him and the child, lest they should awake the savage spirit within him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Brief as was this interval, Mr. Chester had been raised from the bed, and carried from the room. His wife was too intent upon the movements of her son to follow him. \\n\\n \\n\\n For a very few moments did the lovely lad remain in his kneeling position, embracing the child. Utterly exhausted, by drink, by want of rest, by the terrific excitement of this and previous sleepless nights, his eyes closed, and with wild shudders he sank fainting to the ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n In response to Mrs. Chester\u0027s entreaties, the lodgers assisted her to place him on the bed, and this being done she asked them to go down for her clothes, and to bring her word how her husband is. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And take the children away,\" she said with a wan smile. \"I shall stop with my boy and nurse him. I am not frightened of him. He will not hurt me. See, the poor lad has no more strength than a baby.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As they left the room with the children, the mother bent over her degraded son, with love and pity in her heart, and her scalding tears fell on his white lips and on the lucky mole on his temple which was to bring sudden wealth and honour to its possessor. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1679/49483.html","bookId":1173,"book":{"id":1173,"title":"The Duchess of Rosemary Lane","description":"简介： This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.
