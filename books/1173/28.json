{"id":27297,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV.","content":"Seth Dumbrick, sitting in the old cellar in which it seemed likely he would end his days, was the subject of Sally\u0027s anxious observance, as she sat opposite to him, busy with her needle. Sally, in addition to the performance of her household duties, played no unimportant part in providing for the domestic necessities of the establishment, and the seven or eight shillings a week she contrived by hard labour to earn was an important item to Seth, whose trade had fallen off considerably during the past few years. \n \n Sally was a full-grown woman now, looking older than her years; but her nature was unchanged, and her devotion to the Duchess was as perfect as on the day when the girl was brought, almost an infant, to her mother\u0027s house. That was a happy time in her remembrance of it, far different from the present, which was full of trouble. \n \n Seth Dumbrick\u0027s thoughts, to judge from his manner, were harassing and perplexing, and the cloud in his face was reflected on Sally\u0027s, as now and again she raised her eyes from her work to observe him. She knew the groove in which his thoughts were running; it was a familiar one to both of them, and they could not see a clear way through it. Any time during the last five or six years it would have been a safe venture to guess, when they were sitting together, as they were sitting now, that their thoughts were fixed upon the theme which now occupied their minds. \n \n Silence had reigned in the cellar for fully half-an-hour, and even then it was not broken until Seth, rising from his seat, stood for a few moments before the fire, with his hands clasped at the back of his neck. \n \n \"There is but one way out of it, Sally,\" said Seth. \n \n Sally instantly gave him her whole attention, and by a sharp glance indicated that all her wits were at his service. \n \n \"There is but one way out of it,\" he repeated, \"and there\u0027s danger in that way. But it\u0027s a matter of duty, and it\u0027s got to be done. Supposing there was no duty in it, and no love, it\u0027s the only course, as it seems to me, left open to us.\" \n \n He spoke slowly and with deliberation, as though, after long inward communing, he had settled upon a plan, and was determined to carry it out. \n \n \"It\u0027s now--ah, how many years ago is it, Sally, since you came into my cellar and fell into a trance?\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t count \u0027em, Daddy. It seems a lifetime.\" \n \n \"Sixteen years it is. You were a little brown berry, then, with not an ounce of flesh on your bones, sharp as a needle, and with a mind ten times as old as your body.\" He bent over and kissed her, and tears glistened in her eyes. \"And our Duchess was as like a bright angel in a dream as man\u0027s imagination can compass. I was a strong man then, a strong lonely man, with nothing much to look forward to, and with nothing outside my grisly self to love. Sixteen years ago it was. It seems a lifetime to you, you say, Sally. And it was only yesterday that I was a boy!\" \n \n He brushed the sentiment away with a light wave of his hand. \n \n \"As we grow older, Sally, things that were far apart come nearer; that is, when we get to a certain age--my age. Then the young days, that appeared so far away, begin to creep towards us, nearer and nearer, until the man of seventy and the boy of ten are very close together. With some old men, I don\u0027t doubt, it might be said that they die in their cradles. Is that beyond you, Sally?\" \n \n \"A little, Daddy. I can\u0027t understand it; but you\u0027re right, of course,\" \n \n \"Not to wander too far away,\" continued Seth, with a faint laugh, \"it is sixteen years since you and the Duchess came to me, and that I undertook a responsibility. Keep a tight hold of that word, Sally; I\u0027m coming back to it presently. You haven\u0027t much more flesh on your bones now than you had then, but you\u0027re grown pretty considerable, and you\u0027re a woman. Sally, if I had a son, I shouldn\u0027t mind your marrying him.\" \n \n \"Thank you, Daddy.\" \n \n \"But you can\u0027t marry a shadow; it wouldn\u0027t be satisfactory. Well, you\u0027re a woman grown up. I\u0027m a man, growing down; my hair\u0027s nearly white, and that\u0027s the last colour, my girl. It seems to me that I\u0027m pretty well as strong as I was; but I know that\u0027s a delusion. Nature has set lines, and the man that snaps his fingers at \u0027em, or disregards \u0027em, is a fool. And I\u0027m not one, eh, Sally?\" \n \n He laughed faintly again; but there was a notable lack of heartiness in the small flashes of humour which occasionally lighted up his speech. It would have been more in accordance with his serious mood had they not been introduced; but habit is a master, not a servant. \n \n \"So much for you and me, Sally. There\u0027s another of more consequence than both of us--our Duchess. When I first set my eyes on her, I thought I\u0027d never in all my life seen so beautiful a picture. We had plenty of happy days then; and we must never forget how much we owe her. We should have been a dull couple, you and me, without her. She was like light in our dark little room, and when I had troublesome thoughts about me, the sight of her was like the sun breaking through dark clouds. Do you remember, Sally, when she was ill, and you watched over her day and night?\" \n \n \"You too, Daddy.\" \n \n \"I could do nothing; I had the bread to earn. Dr. Lyon said your nursing, not his medicine, pulled her through; and he was right. Do you remember our holiday in the country--the rides in the wagon, and the rambles by the sea-shore? What pleasure and happiness we enjoyed, Sally, was all through her. I can hardly think of her as anything but a child; but, as I\u0027ve said, Nature has set her lines; and our Duchess is a woman--the brightest and most beautiful the world contains; and whether that beauty and brightness is going to be a curse or a blessing to her, time alone can tell.\" \n \n \"Not a curse, Daddy!\" cried Sally, dropping her face in her hands. \"No, no; not a curse!\" \n \n \"God knows,\" said Seth, with his hand resting lightly on Sally\u0027s shoulder. \"If you or me could do anything to make it a blessing we\u0027d do it, if it brought upon us the hardest sacrifice that ever fell upon human beings. I say that of myself, and I know it of you. But I\u0027m a man, with a wider experience than yours, and I can see further. Feeling is one thing, fact is another. To put feeling aside when we talk of our Duchess is out of the question; but let us see how far fact goes, and what it will lead us to.\" He looked down upon his garments with a curious smile; they were old and patched and patched again. Sally, with apprehension in her glance, followed his observance of himself. Then, with an expression of pity and reverence, he turned to Sally, and touched her frock, which was worn and faded. \"Your only frock, Sally,\" he said. \n \n \"What of that?\" she exclaimed, with a rebellious ring in her voice. \"It\u0027s good enough for me.\" \n \n \"We\u0027ve got to see this through,\" he returned, taking her hand in his, and patting it so gently that her head drooped before him. \"You wouldn\u0027t fetch much at Rag Fair, my girl. All that belongs to you, on and off, would fetch, perhaps--three farthings. Now let us look at something else.\" \n \n \"Daddy, Daddy!\" she cried, as she walked to the dark end of the cellar; \"what are you going to do?\" \n \n He replied by dragging forward a trunk, which he placed between Sally and himself. It was locked, and he could not raise the lid. Taking from his pocket a large bunch of keys, he tried them until he found one that fitted the lock. \n \n \"I borrowed these keys of the locksmith round the corner,\" said Seth, as he opened the trunk; \"I told him what sort of a trunk it was, and he said I\u0027d be sure to find a key in this lot to fit it.\" \n \n The trunk was filled with clothes. Before laying his hand upon them, Seth, with a steady look at Sally, said: \n \n \"I doubt, Sally, whether there\u0027s anybody in the world you know better than you know me.\" \n \n \"There is no one, Daddy.\" \n \n \"It has been a pleasure to me to believe that you love me.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s only one I love better than you, Daddy.\u0027 \n \n \"Our Duchess.\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"But in addition to love, you have some other feeling with respect to me. Shall I try to put it in words?\" \n \n \"If you please, Daddy.\" \n \n \"From what you know of me, you know I would not be guilty of a mean or dirty action. You know that I would sooner have my hands cut off than give anyone the power to say, \u0027Seth Dumbrick, you are a scoundrel and a sneak.\u0027\" \n \n \"I am certain of it, Daddy.\" \n \n \"Well, then. Don\u0027t you think anything like that of me because of what I\u0027m doing now. Sally, I\u0027m doing my duty. I\u0027m doing what will perhaps save our Duchess from what both you and me are frightened to speak of to each other. If this man that she\u0027s keeping company with--this gentleman, as she\u0027s spoken of at odd times, when I\u0027ve tried to coax her to confide in me--this gentleman that meets her secretly, and is ashamed or afraid to show his face to me that stands in the light of a father to the girl he\u0027s following--if this gentleman is a gentleman (though his conduct don\u0027t say that much for him), and means fairly and honourably by our girl, then all\u0027s well. But I\u0027ve got to satisfy myself of that. I should deserve the hardest things that could be said of me if I let our child walk blindly into a pit--if I, by holding back, assisted to make her beauty a curse instead of a blessing to her. Do you understand me?\" \n \n \"I think I do.\" \n \n \"If,\" said Seth, with a tender animation in his voice, \"this gentleman wants to marry her, and sets it down as a hard and fast consideration, that she should tear herself away from those who love her, and who have cared for her all these years--if he says to her, \u0027I am a gentleman, and when we are married you will be a lady; and as such you must never speak another word to the low people you\u0027ve lived and associated with from a child;\u0027 if he says this to our Duchess, and we happen to know it, and that it\u0027s for her good it should be so, neither you nor me would step in her way. However sorry we should be, and lonely without her, we should say, \u0027Goodbye, Duchess, and God bless you! We\u0027ll never trouble you or your husband with a sight of our faces again.\u0027 Would that be in your mind as well as in mine, my girl?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" replied Sally, with a sob. \n \n \"But we\u0027ve got to make sure of that--and there\u0027s only one way to come to it, as our girl keeps her tongue still, and her thoughts shut from us. When I accepted the charge of her, I accepted a responsibility, and I\u0027m not going to run away from it like a coward, because the proper carrying of it out will bring a sorrow to my heart that will remain there to my dying day. Do you think now I may look over what\u0027s in this trunk?\" \n \n \"I am certain you\u0027ll do what\u0027s right, Daddy.\" \n \n He gave her another tender glance, and proceeded to examine the trunk. It was filled with a girl\u0027s finery, of a better quality than that which belonged to a person in the Duchess\u0027s position of life. Lace collars and cuffs, feathers for hats, gloves, and underclothing of a fine texture. Sally\u0027s face grew paler as the articles were carefully lifted from the trunk by Seth, and placed upon the table. \n \n \"There are things here you\u0027ve never seen before, Sally?\" \n \n Sally nodded, with lips compressed. \n \n Seth took from the trunk a long soft package, containing a piece of bright blue silk, sufficient for a dress. \n \n \"Did she ever show you this?\" asked Seth. \n \n \"No,\" said Sally, with trembling fingers on the silk. \"How beautiful she will look in it!\" \n \n In a corner of the trunk was a small box made of cedar wood. Opening it, Seth took out various articles of jewelry, and gazed at them with sad eyes. \n \n \"These should be the belongings of a lady, Sally. Our girl is being prepared for the change. Is it to be one of joy or sorrow?\" \n \n At the bottom of the cedar-wood box was a small packet of letters addressed to the Duchess. Seth hesitated. The receipt of these letters had been hidden from him. They were addressed to the Duchess at a post-office a mile distant from Rosemary Lane. He debated within himself whether he had a right to read them. \"If I were her father,\" he thought, \"the right would be clearly mine. As it is, the right is mine. I am her guardian and protector.\" \n \n He read them in silence; they were love letters, expressing the most passionate adoration for the Duchess, and filled with vows and promises enough to distract the mind of any girl in her position. Apart from the expressions of love they contained, there were other disturbing elements--such as the circumstance of the letters being written on paper bearing a crest with Latin words around it. Sally followed Seth\u0027s movements with wistful eagerness, but he did not enlighten her as to the contents of the letters. He returned them and the trinkets to the scented box, and replaced in the trunk with studied care all the articles he had taken from it. Then he locked and carried the trunk to the corner of the cellar again. \n \n \"It may be,\" he said, after a short contemplative pause, \"that our Duchess has really attracted the love of a gentleman. Such things have occurred, produced by faces and figures less beautiful than those of our Duchess.\" \n \n \"Then the change will be one of joy!\" cried Sally, with a brighter look. \n \n \"You know what that means, Sally. It means separation from us. You have a good memory, my girl?\" \n \n \"Oh, yes.\" \n \n \"Carry your mind back to the holiday we had in the country. Do you think you can recall all that occurred in those few happy days?\" \n \n \"Shall I try?\" \n \n \"Yes--just run them over.\" \n \n \"Our packing up the night before; getting up early in the morning and meeting the wagon; trotting out of the dull streets into the beautiful country--I can hear the jingle of the bells on the horses\u0027 necks--the gardens, the lanes, the lovely flowers, and the waving corn; the names of the horses, Daisy and Cornflower--is that right, Daddy?\" \n \n \"Go on, Sally. You have a capital memory.\" \n \n \"Our stopping at the public-house, and having dinner in the garden; our getting into the wagon again, with a lot of fresh hay to sit on; our trotting on and on till we came to another public-house, called The World\u0027s End--I thought it a strange name, and that we were really getting to the end of the world----\" \n \n \"One moment, Sally. Before we came to The World\u0027s End, we saw a great park with splendid iron gates at the entrance. I asked what place it was----\" \n \n \"And the wagoner said it was called Springfield.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s right, Sally; go on. What a memory you\u0027ve got.\" \n \n \"Getting down at The World\u0027s End, and of its being quite early. Then you took us for a walk, and on the way we met a gipsy woman----\" \n \n Sally paused. She remembered perfectly well that the gipsy had predicted that a great trouble would fall upon her through her love for a woman younger than herself, more beautiful than herself, that she loved, and loved dearly; and that then the gipsy had said to the Duchess, \"Show yourself, my beauty.\" Sally did not wish--for the reason that it might be of disadvantage to the Duchess--to recall these details to Seth, who might have forgotten them; as indeed he had, his mind being fixed on a particular point which Sally\u0027s memory had not yet reached; but not the less startling to her was the conviction that the gipsy\u0027s words were coming true. Coming true! Had they not been already verified by the altered relations between herself and the Duchess? It smote her keenly to reflect that for a long, long time past the Duchess had hidden from her knowledge the secret of a love which might tear them asunder for ever. But Sally was not prone to selfish musings; her generous nature was always ready to find excuses for the girl-friend to whom she had been sister and mother; and although her heart was aching sorely, and yearning for confidence and sympathy, she laid no blame on the cause of her sorrow. What more could she desire than that the Duchess should become a lady, and enjoy the life she sighed for? \"I dare say,\" thought Sally, \"that she will let me see her now and again, when no one is near to make her ashamed of me.\" To her own future Sally gave no thought; love of another kind had not yet stirred her soul with its enthralling influence. \n \n \"And while we were talking to the gipsy,\" said Seth, \"a lady and gentleman came up to us.\" \n \n \"Yes, yes; I remember.\" \n \n \"Do you remember what kind of a gentleman?\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t like him, Daddy.\" \n \n \"Nor I. Now as to his name.\" \n \n Sally pondered, but could not call it to mind. \n \n \"If I mention it, you will know, perhaps. Was it Temple?\" \n \n \"Yes, oh, yes; I remember now.\" \n \n \"Sally, would you like to know who has written all those letters to our girl, and who is her gentleman lover?\" \n \n \"Of course I should, Daddy.\" \n \n \"His name is Arthur Temple.\" \n \n \"Not the Mr. Temple we met in the country!\" exclaimed Sally, clasping her hands in a kind of despair. \"He must be an old man by this time.\" \n \n Seth could not help smiling sympathetically. This dismay at the thought of an old lover for their Duchess was very intelligible to him. \n \n \"No, it cannot certainly be that Mr. Temple. But it would be a strange thing if Arthur Temple should turn out to be his son. However, that has to be discovered. Sally, I have made up my mind what to do; and you may depend that it will be for the good of the Duchess.\" \n \n \"You mustn\u0027t interfere with her, Daddy. She won\u0027t put up with it.\" \n \n \"She will not know what I am about; what I do shall be done secretly. It is my duty not to allow this to go on any further without an understanding of some sort. To arrive at this I must set a watch upon her.\" \n \n \"Oh, Daddy if she should see you!\" \n \n \"She shall not see me; I will take care of that. Sally, another thing has to be done; we\u0027re to enter into a compact. Not a word of all this to the Duchess.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll be as mum as a mouse.\" \n \n \"And if things turn out right for the Duchess, we must twist our minds into thinking that they have turned out right for us. It will be dull here without her, but if the love of an old man can make it brighter for you, Sally----\" \n \n A little choking in his voice compelled him to pause, and turn his head. The contemplation of this change in his life, now that he was an old man and worse off in a worldly way than he ever remembered himself to be, brought deep sadness upon him. All the dreams he had indulged in of a bright future for the Duchess, some warmth from which would shine upon herself, had faded quite away. But warmth and light came to him from another quarter. A thin arm stole around his neck, and a dark, loving face was pressed close to his. He drew the grateful woman on his knee, and the few minutes of silence which ensued were not the unhappiest that had been passed in the dingy old cellar. \n \n \"And now, Sally,\" he said, kissing her, \"what we\u0027ve got to do is our duty--straight, my girl, as we can do it--and to hope for the best.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1679/49500.html","bookId":1173,"book":{"id":1173,"title":"The Duchess of Rosemary Lane","description":"简介： This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.
