{"id":27283,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER X.","content":"Sally hesitated before she made her first move. Playing at trances was a new game to her, and she was in the dark in more ways than one. But the crisis was an imminent one, and she was vaguely conscious that none but bold measures would help her safely through it. Yet she approached her subject warily, unaware that Seth\u0027s accustomed eyes could plainly discern the working of every muscle in her face. \"I went off all of a sudden, didn\u0027t I?\" was her first inquiry. \"You did, Sally,\" replied Seth, \"without saying with your leave or by your leave.\" \"And you tried to bring me to.\" \"And couldn\u0027t.\" \"Right you are, Sally.\" \"Then you carried me down here.\" \"How do you know that?\" asked Seth, so abruptly as to shake her nerves. \"You must have done,\" she said in feverish haste. \"How could I be here, else? People don\u0027t walk in trances, do they? Joanna didn\u0027t walk when she was in a trance, did she?\" \"Well, no,\" answered Seth, the corners of his eyelids wrinkling up with amusement. \"I never heard that she did.\" A sigh of relief escaped Sally\u0027s bosom at this confirmatory evidence, and was followed by a chuckle from Seth. \"It stands to reason, Sal, that if Joanna had walked, you\u0027d have done the same.\" \"In course I should,\" said Sally innocently. \"Did I go off like Joanna?\" \"I should say there wasn\u0027t a pin to choose between you.\" A cunning smile played about Sally\u0027s lips. \"You put somethink on my face.\" \"Water, Sal, to bring you to.\" \"But somethink else,\" said Sally, with a slight shudder, \"somethink that crept and frightened me.\" \"You see, Sally, you were so bad, and wanted such a deal of bringing to, that I had to take the water from my aquarium----\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"You\u0027ll know by-and-bye. There\u0027s fish in it, and all sorts of things, and when I dipped the cup in, out came a water-beetle. There isn\u0027t a bit of harm in the little creatures, but they do creep! Now for the vision, Sally.\" Sally puckered her eyebrows, and tightly interlaced her little fingers. \"It was dark and it was light,\" she slowly commenced. \"Not both at once. That could hardly be--though we don\u0027t quite know what happens in trances.\" \"No, we don\u0027t, do we? It wasn\u0027t light and dark together. First it was dark, and then it was light. I couldn\u0027t see a wision in the dark, could I?\" \"I should say not, Sal; but I never was in a trance, you know. I\u0027m not one o\u0027 the prophesying sort.\" \"So it must ha\u0027 been light when it come. There was all sorts o\u0027 things flying about--birds, and angels, and spirits. It was splendid. Then all of a sudden a king comes to me done up in a bundle.\" \"Pharaoh,\" suggested Seth, in the midst of a quiet fit of laughter. \"Yes, Pharer, it was,\" said Sally, eagerly adopting the suggestion. \"Because that\u0027s the only old king you ever heard of.\" \"Yes. Well, Pharer come----\" \"Stop a minute, Sal. What was he like?\" \"Didn\u0027t you never see him?\" \"I never set eyes on the old gentleman.\" A deeper puckering of Sally\u0027s eyebrows, and a tighter interlacing of her little fingers. \"He was done up in a bundle, you know, and I didn\u0027t see much of him.\" \"Was he like the doll outside old Adam\u0027s rag and bone shop?\" \"A little bit.\" \"Only he didn\u0027t have a black face,\" \"No,\" said Sally, following the cues with heaving bosom. \"But his face was painted.\" \"In course it was.\" \"In stripes. Red, and yellow, and green.\" \"Yes, he looked so rum! And he had a big gold crown on his head.\" \"Ah,\" said Seth, in a tone of sly satisfaction, \"now I can say I\u0027ve seen Pharaoh if anybody asks me. Go on, Sal.\" \"Well, he come, and said----\" \"Ho! ho! Sally! he spoke to you, did he?\" \"Yes, he said a lot.\" \"Now,\" mused Seth, hugging himself in great enjoyment, \"how did he speak?\" \"With his tongue,\" replied Sally, with precocious sharpness. \"Yes, yes, with his tongue, of course. But in what language? It couldn\u0027t be Hebrew, because he hated the Jews, and wouldn\u0027t have lowered himself to it. Besides if he had, you wouldn\u0027t have understood him.\" \"Not in a trance?\" asked Sally in a cunning tone. \"I should say,\" replied Seth very gravely, \"not even in a trance.\" \"Why, then, he spoke what I\u0027m speaking to you, and what you\u0027re speaking to me--jist the same. \u0027Git up, Sally,\u0027 he says, \u0027and come along o\u0027 me; I\u0027m going to show you somethink.\u0027 I got up and went along of him.\" \"The people must have stared, Sal, to see you and Pharaoh walking together.\" \"We didn\u0027t mind that. We walks straight to the horspital, and there\u0027s father laying in bed. \u0027Shall I ever git better?\u0027 says father to Pharer. \u0027No,\u0027 says Pharer, \u0027you\u0027ll never git better. Do you hear, Sal? Father\u0027ll never git better.\u0027 Then we goes out of the horspital, me and Pharer, and walks miles and miles into the country, and we come to a big, big place with stone walls. \u0027Mother\u0027s in there, Sal,\u0027 says Pharer; and I peeps through and sees poor mother working and working.\" \"Was it a prison, then, that mother was in?\" \"No, it was a workus. \u0027If you was to go to her,\u0027 says Pharer, she\u0027d be turned away. She\u0027s got eighteen pound a year.\u0027 Is that a lot?\" asked Sally, suddenly breaking off. \"It\u0027s a lot taken in a lump,\" replied Seth, upon whose face a more thoughtful expression was gathering, \"and a year\u0027s a lot, too, Sally.\" \"Is three-and-sixpence a week a lot for a gal\u0027s keep?\" asked Sally, pursuing her inquiries. \"What sort of a girl? One who would make herself handy?\" \"Oh, yes; and do anythink, never mind what. Clean and scrub, and git up early and light the fire and go of errands----\" Thus Sally breathlessly ran on. \"But this girl\u0027s so small--not strong enough to do all that.\" \"She\u0027d git bigger, and stronger, and older, every day. And you don\u0027t know, oh, you don\u0027t know what she wouldn\u0027t do, if you wanted her to! And she\u0027d be as good as gold.\" \"Then this girl\u0027s liable to fainting dead away, without notice----\" \"She wouldn\u0027t do it!\" cried Sally, beating her hands together and creeping closer to Seth; \"she wouldn\u0027t do it, if you didn\u0027t want her to!\" \"--And of falling into trances--\" \"She\u0027d never do so agin, this gal wouldn\u0027t, if you didn\u0027t want her to!\" \"Three-and-sixpence wouldn\u0027t go far, Sal, but it\u0027s something. What next did Pharaoh say?\" \"\u0027She\u0027s got eighteen pound a year,\u0027 says Pharer, \u0027and she\u0027s been obliged to go away from you \u0027cause she\u0027s so poor, and couldn\u0027t git nothink to eat; but she\u0027s giving somebody three-and-sixpence a week for your keep.\u0027\" \"Ah, ah, Sally, now we\u0027re coming to it.\" \"After that, Pharer looks at baby----\" \"Saying anything about her keep, Sal?\" \"Oh, no; there\u0027s no need to. I keep her, you know; I take care of her. I nurse her, and wash her, and dress her, and put her to bed, and she\u0027s no trouble to nobody.\" \"Not even to you, Sal, I suppose.\" \"Not to me--oh, no, not to me, \u0027cause I love her, and she\u0027s the beautifullest baby there ever was! Pharer looks at her, and says, \u0027When baby grows up, she\u0027ll be a lady, and \u0027ll have fine clothes, and \u0027ll give everybody money who\u0027s been good to her.\u0027 That\u0027s sure to come true, that is.\" \"Pharaoh says?\" \"No, I say. It\u0027s sure to come true. You mind, now! Whoever\u0027s good to baby\u0027ll be done good to.\" \"A good Christian sentiment, Sal. And then?\" \"Then,\" said Sally abruptly, \"Pharer goes away.\" \"Walks away?\" \"No, flies away, and is swallowed up like. That\u0027s all of it.\" And with her heart beating as fast as if she were in a high state of fever, Sally, whose hand was resting on Seth\u0027s knee, waited in the deepest anxiety to learn her fate. Seth put his hand down, and it touched Sally\u0027s face. He gave a start as he touched her cheek, which was wet with her tears, fast and silently flowing. \"Sally,\" he said, \"you\u0027ve got a brother.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you somethink,\" rejoined Sally quietly and solemnly; \"but you mustn\u0027t tell him, or he\u0027d beat me.\" \"I won\u0027t tell him, my child.\" \"I don\u0027t think,\" sobbed Sally, \"as he\u0027s any good.\" \"Why?\" \"It was him as made father ill, and him as made mother poor. And last night, when I was abed, pretending to be asleep, I sor him eating up all the bread and drinking up all the tea. And when he went away, mother cried and cried.\" Many moments passed in silence. Then Seth rose, and lit a candle, Sally following his movements with undisguised anxiety. \"Look about you, Sal.\" Sally gazed with longing, admiring eyes at the treasures of the cellar, which was a veritable Aladdin\u0027s cave in her sight. It was with difficulty she removed her eyes from the aquarium, which was something so entirely outside her experience as to make it a marvel indeed. \"Here\u0027s my bed, Sally; and here\u0027s my cupboard; and here\u0027s my frying-pan and saucepan and kettle, all clean and tidy.\" As he seemed to expect an answer, Sally nodded. \"Now here,\" he continued, lifting a blanket which, hung on a line, divided off a portion of the cellar, \"is a place where two children might sleep, supposing such an out and out-of-the-way circumstance should ever occur to Seth Dumbrick as taking two ready-made, mischievous girls----\" \"Oh, no,\" interrupted Sally positively, \"not mischievous. Good.\" \"You\u0027re not fit to judge. Supposing, I say, such an extraordinary and ridiculous circumstance were to occur to Seth Dumbrick as his taking two girls, one of \u0027em a baby----\" \"Such a beauty!\" again interrupted the irrepressible Sally. \"Kiss him, baby.\" She put baby\u0027s face to his, and, utterly confounded and unable to resist, Seth Dumbrick kissed a pair of lips for the first time for Heaven knows how many years. \"If I believed in the Bible,\" he muttered, \"which I don\u0027t, it\u0027d be almost like kissing that. Sally, will you stop here, quiet, while I go out a bit?\" \"Yes,\" replied Sally joyfully. \"You won\u0027t move, you won\u0027t touch a thing?\" \"No, I won\u0027t--I won\u0027t!\" \"And you won\u0027t mind sitting in the dark?\" \"N--no,\" said Sally, with a little shiver. \"One soon gets used to it.\" \" I would,\" said Sally, becoming suddenly brave. \"I can\u0027t afford to burn candles all day long. You won\u0027t touch the aquarium, or put your fingers in the water?\" \"No--no; I\u0027ll never!\" \"Because my fish bite, Sally.\" \"I won\u0027t move from here, Mr. Dumbrick,\" protested Sally, grouping mentally for some strong affirmation. \"I hope I may never move at all if I do!\" \"Very well; I sha\u0027n\u0027t be gone long.\" Seth Dumbrick went straight towards Mrs. Chester\u0027s lodgings. He met that good woman on his way, inquiring anxiously of her neighbours whether they had seen anything of her child. \"She\u0027s at my place,\" said Seth, \"with her baby, and has been there ever so long.\" \"You\u0027ve lifted a weight off my heart,\" said Mrs. Chester. \"I was afraid Sally was run over. I\u0027ll give it her when she comes home!\" \"Home!\" echoed Seth. \"Yes, home,\" repeated Mrs. Chester. \"For how long,\" asked Seth, \"will it be a home for her?\" Mrs. Chester turned very white, and looked at Seth Dumbrick for an explanation. \"Mrs. Chester,\" he said with a curious hesitation, \"what sort of a man do you consider me to be?\" \"I don\u0027t know any harm of you, Mr. Dumbrick.\" \"That\u0027s neither one thing nor the other. It don\u0027t matter, though. I\u0027d like to hear the rights of the story about Sally\u0027s baby, if you\u0027ve no objection.\" Mrs. Chester related what she knew, and Seth Dumbrick listened thoughtfully and attentively. \"And you\u0027ve never since set eyes on the man who brought the child to your house?\" \"Never before or since, Mr. Dumbrick.\" \"There\u0027s a mystery in it,\" mused Seth, \"and I\u0027m partial to mystery. Here we are at your place. May I come up?\" Without waiting for permission, he pushed his way upstairs, and entered Mrs. Chester\u0027s room. In the first glance he saw the state of poverty to which she was reduced. Unceremoniously he went to the cupboard and opened it; there was no food on the shelves. Then he turned to Mrs. Chester, and fixed his great grey eyes on her so piercingly that she began to grow frightened. \"You\u0027re a married woman. Where\u0027s your wedding-ring?\" She placed her left hand quickly behind her. \"I don\u0027t mean any harm. Where is it?\" \"In pawn?\" \"That\u0027s always the last thing to go, Mrs. Chester.\" Weak and sick, she sank, panting, into a chair. \"Your husband\u0027s in the hospital?\" \"Yes,\" she sighed. \"And you\u0027re going to take a situation in a workhouse?\" \"Who told you?\" cried Mrs. Chester, her tears beginning to flow. \"Some distance from here it is, and you\u0027ll get eighteen pound a year. And you don\u0027t mind giving three-and-sixpence a week to anyone who\u0027ll take care of Sally.\" \"I don\u0027t know where you found out all this,\" sobbed Mrs. Chester, \"but it\u0027s true. I\u0027ve been trying all the morning to get a place for Sally--she\u0027s a handy little thing, Mr. Dumbrick--but can\u0027t find one. Everybody\u0027s full enough of trouble as it is, without wishing for more. I don\u0027t blame \u0027em, I\u0027m sure, but I feel that desperate that I\u0027m fit to make away with myself. Do you think I\u0027d part with my child if I could possibly help it?\" \"I never had one,\" replied Seth gravely, \"so I\u0027m no judge. Mrs. Chester, I\u0027m a lonely man, and have lived a lonely life. You know me and what I am. I\u0027m never out of work, and I never intend to be, if I can help it. I don\u0027t set myself up as a good man, but I dare say I\u0027d pass in a crowd. Do you see what I\u0027m driving at?\" \"Not exactly, Mr. Dumbrick.\" \"I\u0027ve felt sometimes lately, when I\u0027ve been alone in my cellar, as if I\u0027d like some one to talk to, some creature like myself about me to look at. I\u0027d as soon set fire to my place as take a woman in it, and a boy\u0027d plague the life out of me. But a little girl, or a little girl and a baby, I wouldn\u0027t so much mind. She could make herself handy, and might grow into my ways. Now do you see what I\u0027m driving at?\" \"You mean that you\u0027d take Sally, and keep her, if I paid you three-and-sixpence a week.\" \"Partly right and partly wrong. I mean that I\u0027ve no objections to take Sally and the little creature as seems to be cast upon the world without a friend, and give \u0027em both their meals and a bed. So far you\u0027re right. But you\u0027re not as to the three-and-sixpence a week.\" \"Would you want more, Mr. Dumbrick?\" asked Mrs. Chester imploringly. \"I\u0027ve been reckoning up as I came along how much a year three-and-sixpence a week is, and I make it out to be more than nine pound. That\u0027s a big hole in eighteen pound. You wouldn\u0027t be able to save a shilling out of it.\" \"I don\u0027t want to; I only want to live. God help us! Poor people must live as well as rich.\" \"They\u0027ve as much right to, certainly, but that\u0027s not to the point. This is. I\u0027m not willing to take three-and-sixpence a week. I\u0027ll take half-a-crown.\" \"God bless you, Mr. Dumbrick! How shall I ever thank you?\" Seth made a wry face at the blessing. \"But I\u0027ve got a bargain of another kind to make. There\u0027s Sally\u0027s baby. She comes too, of course, and we don\u0027t reckon her. She\u0027s thrown in, as a body might say--a kind of make-weight. Now Sally is your child, and I reckon you are fond of her.\" Mrs. Chester sighed an eloquent assent. \"One of these fine days,\" continued Seth, \"you might make your fortune sudden.\" (Mrs. Chester thought of her lovely lad and his lucky mole, and listened with greater interest.) \"You might pick up a purse of money, or an old pauper might die, and when you ripped up her clothes you might find \u0027em stuffed with bank-notes. In that case you\u0027d come to me and take Sally away.\" \"It ain\u0027t likely any of them things\u0027ll happen, Mr. Dumbrick.\" \"I\u0027ve heard of stranger things. Now I go on again. I should by that time have got used to Sally, perhaps, and shouldn\u0027t like to part with her. That wouldn\u0027t matter to you. You\u0027d take her. But there\u0027s the other. She\u0027s not your child, and you\u0027ve no claim on her.\" \"No more than you have.\" \"Very well, then. Now I make this bargain with you, Mrs. Chester. If ever anything should happen as\u0027d make you want to take Sally away, you wouldn\u0027t take the baby away as well. She\u0027d be mine, and you\u0027d have no right to her. You understand?\" \"Perfectly, and I\u0027m quite agreeable. A mother\u0027s got enough to do with her own children, without being saddled with strange ones. Though this little one is a beautiful child, Mr. Dumbrick, and my heart warmed to her so that if I could afford it I\u0027d be glad to keep her. God help those who\u0027ve deserted her so cruelly!\" \"Then it\u0027s a bargain, and I\u0027ll go and send Sally to you. You\u0027d best keep the children with you till you go away. Then you can bring \u0027em to me, and make \u0027em over.\" \"You\u0027ll be kind to Sally, Mr. Dumbrick.\" Seth rasped his chin with his horny hand. \"As kind as it\u0027s in my nature to be; I can\u0027t promise more than that.\" \"And you won\u0027t mind her fainting away now and then; she\u0027ll get over it as she grows, I hope.\" \"I\u0027ve had a sample, and I don\u0027t mind it much. To tell you the truth,\" he added grimly, \"it amuses me.\" Mrs. Chester looked doubtful; Sally\u0027s fainting dead away had not been an amusement to her, and she was fearful that Seth was disposed to make light of her child\u0027s misfortune; but the quaint smile which came to Seth\u0027s lips after his remark had so much of kindness in it that she was reassured. \"I can trust you, I think, Mr. Dumbrick.\" \"If I wasn\u0027t sure you could, I wouldn\u0027t have come to you,\" was his reply, and then he paused for a moment or two. \"Mrs. Chester, I can spare you two shillings if you\u0027re in need of it.\" This was sufficient evidence, and Mrs. Chester gratefully pressed his hand. Seth placed two shillings on the table, and walked off quickly. That night everything was settled; Dr. Lyon advised Mrs. Chester not to delay, and she agreed to go to her situation on the following day. He spoke well of Seth Dumbrick also. \"He has a rough outside,\" said the sensible doctor, \"but it covers a kernel of goodness, if I don\u0027t mistake. The strawberry, you know, Mrs. Chester, grows underneath the nettle.\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Mrs. Chester, seeing but vaguely the application. Mrs. Chester had no heart to bid farewell to her neighbours. She left Rosemary Lane almost by stealth, going first to Seth Dumbrick with the two children. \"You\u0027d like to see my place, perhaps,\" said Seth, and led the way to his cellar. Mrs. Chester was dismayed somewhat by the gloomy look of the apartment. \"It is very dark, Mr. Dumbrick.\" \"Not when one\u0027s accustomed to it,\" was the reply; \"besides there\u0027s a bit o\u0027 light behind the cloud.\" He went to the back, and opened a door which disclosed a flight of steps, leading up to a yard in the rear of the house. The sun happened to be shining brightly, and the light struggling in gave the cellar a more habitable appearance. \"I\u0027ve sometimes thought of having a window let in,\" said Seth; \"perhaps I\u0027ll do it after a bit. And there\u0027s nothing to be said against it at night.\" In fact there was an undiscovered window in the back wall, hidden by shutters. Seth seemed to wish not to make the bargain an attractive one in Mrs. Chester\u0027s eyes. She knelt before Sally, and kissed her and cried over her. \"You\u0027re sorry I\u0027m going to leave you, my pet--say you\u0027re sorry.\" Sally required no prompting. She loved her mother, but her practical little wits had gauged the situation, and she had done the best she could in the circumstances. Seth, with delicate forethought, left the mother and the children alone, and mounted to his stall, where he continued his work of soling and heeling and patching. Presently, Mrs. Chester stood by his side. He walked with her down the street. \"Don\u0027t take on,\" he said; \"I\u0027ll look after Sally, and you can always write to me here, if you\u0027ve anything to say. I\u0027m settled in Rosemary Lane for life. Goodbye; I wish you better days.\" He left her in the company of her lovely lad, Ned, the cause of all her trouble. She was to take coach to the country, and her son accompanied her to the yard it started from, grumbling all the way at his hard lot; for now his mother was leaving him, he had no loving nature to impose upon. \"If ever you\u0027re in trouble, my dear boy,\" sobbed Mrs. Chester, \"don\u0027t keep it from me.\" \"I won\u0027t,\" he replied, with much sincerity. \"And if ever you grow rich, Ned----\" The contemplation of this happy certainty in the future lightened her heart, and with kisses and tears she bade farewell to him and to the neighbourhood endeared to her in many ways, notwithstanding the hard fortune she had experienced there. In the meantime Seth Dumbrick retraced his way to his stall, somewhat unsettled in his mind as to the wisdom of the step he had taken. In his cellar he found Sally very industriously washing up some dirty plates; comfortably propped on a chair was the treasure-baby. Seth glanced suspiciously round to note if anything which should not have been disturbed was out of its place; Sally\u0027s eyes followed his with sly satisfaction. She had finished washing the crockery, and was now ostentatiously wiping her bare arms, like a little old woman of sixty. \"I keep my eyes wide open,\" said Sally, \"as wide as wide can be, and the things come out of the darkness to meet me. Jist look; I can walk all about, without touching a thing.\" Sally brought this to proof by winding her way quickly about the dark room, round the table, in and out of the chairs, round the aquarium, and all with such precision and anxious desire to please as could not fail to elicit approval. \"You\u0027re a cunning little sinner,\" said Seth, \"and I don\u0027t doubt that we shall get along pretty well together.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1679/49486.html","bookId":1173,"book":{"id":1173,"title":"The Duchess of Rosemary Lane","description":"简介： This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.
