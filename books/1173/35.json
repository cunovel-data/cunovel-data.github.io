{"id":27304,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX.","content":"They did not escape unobserved, and within a short time of their departure from the hotel, were being tracked by friend and foe. The ostler attached to the hotel saw the woman stealing away, and noted the direction they took; and when Ned Chester drove to the \"Empire\" and heard with dismay of the flight, the ostler turned an honest penny by directing him on their road. He turned more than one honest penny on this--to him--fortunate night. Richards, who had made himself fully acquainted with Ned\u0027s movements, arrived at the hotel, in company with Arthur Temple, a few minutes after the runaway thief left it, and had no difficulty in obtaining the information he required. \n \n \"Two birds with one stone, sir,\" he said to Arthur; \"we shall catch the thief and save the girl.\" \n \n \"We may be too late if we go afoot,\" said Arthur; \"every moment is precious. Now, my man,\" to the ostler, \"your fastest horse and your lightest trap. A guinea for yourself if they are ready without delay; another guinea if we overtake the persons we are after.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll earn them both, sir,\" cried the ostler, running to the stable door. \"You go into the hotel and speak to the missis.\" \n \n No sooner said than done. Before the horse was harnessed, the landlady had been satisfied. \n \n \"My name is Temple,\" said Arthur to her in a heat, after the first words of explanation. \"Here is my card, and here is some money as a guarantee. It is a matter of life and death, and the safety of an innocent girl hangs upon the moments.\" \n \n His excitement communicated itself to the landlady, who was won by his good looks and his enthusiasm, and she herself ran out to expedite the matter. They were soon on the road, but not soon enough to prevent Ned Chester from having more than a fair start of them. \n \n Richards, who held the reins, needed no such incentive to put on the best speed as his young master\u0027s impatience unremittingly provided. As rapidly as possible the horse ploughed its way through the heavy snow. Their course lay beyond the railway station, and as they passed it the few passengers by a train which had just arrived were emerging from the door. To Arthur Temple\u0027s surprise Richards, whose lynx eyes were watching every object, suddenly pulled up in the middle of the road. \n \n \"Hold the reins a moment, sir,\" he said jumping from the conveyance; \"here\u0027s somebody may be useful.\" \n \n He had caught sight of two faces he recognised, those of Sally and Seth Dumbrick. \n \n \"Have you come here after the Duchess?\" he asked, arresting his steps. \n \n \"Yes. Oh! yes,\" answered Sally, in amazement. Richards pulled her towards the conveyance, and Seth followed close at her heels. \n \n \"Jump in,\" said Richards, who by this time was fully enjoying the adventure. \"I\u0027ll take you to her. Don\u0027t stop to ask questions; there\u0027s no time to answer them.\" \n \n Seth hesitated, but a glance at Arthur\u0027s truthful, ingenuous face dispelled his doubts, and he mounted the conveyance with Sally, and entered into earnest conversation with the young man. \n \n Mrs. Lenoir, when she stole with the Duchess through the streets of Sevenoaks, had but one object in view--to escape from the town into the country, where she believed they would be safe from pursuit. Blindly she led the way until she came to the country. Fortunately at about this time the snow ceased to fall, and the exciting events of the night rendered her and the Duchess oblivious to the difficulties which attended their steps. So unnerved was the Duchess by what had occurred that she was bereft of all power over her will, and she allowed herself unresistingly, and without question, to be led by Mrs. Lenoir to a place of safety and refuge. They encouraged each other by tender words and caresses, and Mrs. Lenoir looked anxiously before her for a cottage or farmhouse, where they could obtain shelter and a bed. But no such haven was in sight until they were at some distance from the town, when the devoted woman saw a building which she hoped might prove what she was in search of. As they approached closer to the building she was undeceived; before her stood a quaint old church, with a hooded porch, and a graveyard by its side. A sudden faintness came upon her as she recognised the familiar outlines of the sacred refuge in which her child was born; but before the full force of this recognition had time to make itself felt, her thoughts were wrested from contemplation of the strange coincidence by sounds of pursuing shouts. \n \n Her mother\u0027s fears, her mother\u0027s love, interpreted the sounds aright, and she knew that they proceeded from the man from whom they were endeavouring to escape. Seizing the Duchess\u0027s arm, she flew towards the porch, and reaching it at the moment Ned Chester overtook them, thrust the girl into the deeper shadows, and stood before her child with flashing eyes with her arms spread out as a shield. \n \n \"So!\" cried Ned Chester, panting and furious; \"a pretty trick you have played me! Serve me right for trusting to such a woman!\" \n \n He strove to push her aside, so that he might have speech with the Duchess, and Mrs. Lenoir struck him in the face. He laughed at the feeble blow--not lightly, but mockingly. The savage nature of the man was roused. He raised his hand to return the blow, when the Duchess stepped forward and confronted him. His arm dropped to his side. \n \n \"What is the meaning of this?\" he asked, endeavouring to convey some tenderness in his tone. \"What has this creature been telling you? She has been poisoning your mind against me, if I\u0027m a judge of things. Come, be reasonable; take my arm, and let us return to the hotel.\" \n \n But his power over the girl was gone; the brutality of his manner was a confirmation of the story she had heard of his treachery towards her. \n \n \"Mr. Chester,\" she said--and paused, frightened at the change which came over him at the utterance of his name. His face grew white, and an ugly twitching played about his lips. \n \n \"What have you heard?\" he demanded hoarsely. \n \n She mustered sufficient strength to reply faintly. \n \n \"The truth.\" \n \n His savage nature mastered him. With a cruel sweep of his arm, he dashed Mrs. Lenoir to the ground, and clasped the Duchess in a fierce embrace. Her shrieks pierced the air. \n \n \"Help! Help!\" \n \n Her appeal was answered, almost on the instant. An iron grasp upon his neck compelled him to relinquish his hold of the terrified girl. Seth Dumbrick held him as in a vice and he had no power to free himself. The warning voice of Richards was needed to put a limit to the strong man\u0027s just resentment: \n \n \"Don\u0027t hurt him any more than is necessary, Mr. Seth Dumbrick. There\u0027s a rod in pickle for him worse than anything you can do to him.\" \n \n \"Lie there, you dog!\" exclaimed Seth, forcing Ned Chester to the ground, and placing his foot upon his breast. \"Stir an inch, and I will kill you!\" \n \n While this episode in the drama was being enacted, another of a different kind was working itself out. When the Duchess was released by Ned Chester, Arthur Temple threw his arm around her, to prevent her from falling. \n \n \"Do not be frightened,\" he said, in a soothing tone, \"you are safe now. I am glad we are in time. My name is Arthur Temple.\" \n \n They gazed at each other in rapt admiration. To Arthur, the beauty of the Duchess was a revelation. In the struggle with Ned Chester, her hat had fallen from her head, and her hair lay upon her shoulders in heavy golden folds. Her lovely eyes, suffused with tears, were raised to his face in gratitude. For a moment she was blind to everything but the appearance of this hero, who, as it seemed to her fevered fancy, had descended from Heaven to rescue her. But a cry of compassion from Sally brought her back to earth, and, turning, she saw her faithful nurse and companion kneeling in the snow, with Mrs. Lenoir\u0027s head in her lap. She flew to her side, and tremblingly assisted Sally in her endeavour to restore the insensible woman to life. But the blow which Ned Chester had dealt Mrs. Lenoir was a fierce one; she lay as one dead, and when, after some time, she showed signs of life, she feebly waved her hands, in the effort to beat away a shadowed horror, and moaned: \n \n \"Will he never come? Will he never come?\" \n \n She was living the past over again. Her mind had gone back to the time when, assisted by John, the gardener of Springfield, she had travelled in agony through the heavy snow, to implore the man who had betrayed and deserted her to take pity on her hapless state, and to render her some kind of human justice, if not for her sake, for the sake of his child, then unborn. And the thought which oppressed her and filled her with dread at that awful epoch of her life, now found expression on her lips: \n \n \"Will he never come? Oh, my God! will he never come?\" \n \n \"Do you think,\" whispered Arthur Temple to Seth Dumbrick, who had given Ned Chester into Richards\u0027 charge, \"that we might raise her into the trap, and drive her slowly to the town?\" \n \n The tender arms about her desisted from their effort as she moaned: \n \n \"If you raise me in your arms, I shall die! If you attempt to carry me into the town, I shall die!\" \n \n The very words she had spoken to John on that night of agony. And then again: \n \n \"Will he never come? If he saw me, he would take pity on me! Send him to me, kind Heaven!\" \n \n Another actor appeared upon the scene,--Mr. Temple, who, accompanied by the ostler, had found his way to the spot. \n \n \"Arthur!\" he cried. \n \n The young man rose at once to his feet, and went to his father. \n \n Mr. Temple, in the brief glance he threw around him, saw faces he recognised; saw Richards guarding Ned Chester, saw Seth Dumbrick and Sally, saw, without observing her face, Mrs. Lenoir lying with her head on the Duchess\u0027s bosom. He did not look at them a second time. His only thought was of Arthur, the pride and hope of his life, the one being he loved on earth. \n \n \"What has brought you here, sir?\" asked Arthur. \"Anxiety for you,\" replied Mr. Temple. \"Why do I see you in this company? How much is true of the story that man told me?\"--pointing to Seth Dumbrick. \"If you have got yourself into any trouble----\" \n \n The look of pained surprise in Arthur\u0027s face prevented the completion of the sentence. The father and son had moved a few paces from the group, and the words they exchanged were heard only by themselves. \n \n \"If I have got myself into any trouble!\" echoed Arthur, struggling with the belief his father\u0027s words carried to his mind. \"What trouble do you refer to?\" \n \n \"We must not play with words, Arthur. My meaning is plain. If that man\u0027s story is true, and you have entangled yourself with a woman--such things commonly happen----\" \n \n \"For both our sakes,\" said Arthur, drawing himself up, \"say not another word. I came here to save an innocent girl from a villain\u0027s snare. When you find me guilty of any such wickedness as your words imply, renounce me as your son--as I would renounce a son of mine if unhappily he should prove himself capable of an act so base and cruel! The name of Temple is not to be sullied by such dishonour!\" \n \n Mr. Temple shuddered involuntarily, remembering that it was on this very spot he, a mature and worldly-wise man, had been guilty of an act immeasurably more base and dishonourable than that in the mind of his generous-hearted son. \n \n \"Come, sir,\" said Arthur, taking his father\u0027s hand, and leading him to the group, \"do justice to others as well as to myself. This is the young lady whom, happily, we have saved. Confess that you have never looked upon a fairer face, nor one more innocent.\" \n \n Mr. Temple\u0027s breath came and went quickly as the Duchess raised her tear-stained face to his. At this moment, Mrs. Lenoir, with a deep sigh, opened her eyes and saw Mr. Temple bending over her. With a shriek that struck terror to the hearts of those who surrounded her, she struggled from the arms of the Duchess, and embraced the knees of Mr. Temple. \n \n \"You have come, then--you have come! Heaven has heard my prayers! I knew you would not desert me! Oh, God! my joy will kill me!\" \n \n And looking down upon the kneeling woman, clasping his knees in a delirium of false happiness, Mr. Temple, with a face that rivalled in whiteness the snow-covered plains around him, gazed into the face of Nelly Marston! \n \n A suspicion of the possible truth struggled to the mind of the Duchess. \n \n \"Mother!\" she said, in a voice of much tenderness, raising the prostrate woman from her knees, and supporting her, \"why should you kneel to him?\" \n \n The tender voice, the tender embrace, the sudden flashing upon her senses of the forms standing about her, recalled Mrs. Lenoir from her dream, and she clung to her daughter with a fierce and passionate clinging. \n \n \"My child! my child! They shall not take you from me! Say that you will not desert me--promise me, my child! I will work for you--I will be your servant--anything----\" \n \n \"Hush, mother!\" said the girl. \"Be comforted. I will never leave you. No power can part us.\" \n \n With a supreme effort of will, Mr. Temple tore himself from the contemplation of the shameful discovery, and the likely consequences of the exposure. \n \n \"Come, Arthur,\" he said, holding out his trembling hand to his son; \"this is no place for us.\" \n \n His voice was weak and wandering, and he seemed to have suddenly grown ten years older. \n \n Arthur did not stir from the side of Mrs. Lenoir. \n \n \"Come, I say!\" cried Mr. Temple petulantly; \"have you no consideration for me? It can all be explained; we will talk over the matter when we are alone.\" \n \n \"We must talk of it now,\" said Arthur solemnly, \"with God\u0027s light shining upon us, and before His House of Prayer.\" \n \n A high purpose shone in the young man\u0027s face, and his manner was sad and earnest. He took Mrs. Lenoir\u0027s hand with infinite tenderness and respect: \n \n \"Will you answer, with truth, what I shall ask you?\" \n \n \"As truthfully as I would speak in presence of my Maker!\" replied Mrs. Lenoir, with downcast head. \n \n \"This gentleman is my father. What is he to you?\" \n \n \"He is the father of my dear child, torn from me by a cruel fraud, and now, thank God, Oh, thank God! restored to me by a miracle. He should have been my husband. When he prevailed upon me to fly with him--I loved him, and was true to him in thought and deed, as God is my Judge!--he promised solemnly to marry me.\" \n \n \"And then----\" \n \n \"I can say no more,\" murmured Mrs. Lenoir with sobs that shook the souls of all who heard; \"he deserted me, and left me to shame and poverty. O, my child!\" she cried, turning her streaming eyes to the Duchess, \"tell me that you forgive me!\" \n \n \"It is not you who need forgiveness, mother,\" sobbed the Duchess, falling into her mother\u0027s arms. \n \n A terrible silence ensued, broken by the querulous voice of Mr. Temple: \n \n \"This woman\u0027s story is false. Arthur, will you take her word against mine? Remember what I have done for you--think of the love I bear you! Do nothing rash, I implore you! Say, if you like, that she has not lied. I will be kind to her, and will see that her life is passed in comfort. Will that content you?\" He paused between every sentence for his son to speak, but no sound passed Arthur\u0027s lips. From the depths of his soul, whose leading principles were honour and justice, the young man was seeking for the right path. Exasperated by his silence, Mr. Temple continued, and in a rash moment said: \"What can she adduce but her bare word? What evidence that the girl is my child?\" \n \n A voice from the rear of the group supplied the proof he asked for. It was Richards who spoke. \n \n \"I can give the evidence. The girl is your child.\" \n \n Mr. Temple turned upon him with a look of fear, and the eyes of all were directed to Richards\u0027 face. \n \n The scene had produced so profound an effect upon the man that, holding the last link required to complete the chain, he was impressed with a superstitious dread that a judgment would fall upon him if he held back at this supreme moment. \n \n \"The child is yours. Before you instructed me to ascertain the particulars concerning Seth Dumbrick\u0027s life, I had made the discovery. It was I who took the child to Rosemary Lane, and left her there.\" \n \n \"You traitor!\" cried Mr. Temple, almost frenzied; \"you have deceived and betrayed me!\" \n \n \"You told me,\" said Richards, in a dogged voice, \"that you wished the child placed in such a position in life that she should never be able to suspect who was her father, and I did the best I could. You employed me to do your dirty work, and I did it, and was paid for it. And when, to try you, I told you that your child had died, you expressed in your manner so little pity, that, having learned to know you, I thought it as well not to undeceive you.\" \n \n The last link was supplied, and the chain was complete. This disclosure effected a startling change in Mr. Temple\u0027s demeanour. He drew himself up haughtily. \"Arthur, I command you to come with me.\" \n \n \"I cannot obey you, sir,\" said Arthur sadly and firmly. \"You have broken the tie which bound us. I will never enter your house again; nor will I share your dishonour. Justice shows me the road where duty lies, and I will follow it.\" \n \n He held out his hand to the Duchess; she accepted it, and clasped it in love and wonder; and passing his disengaged arm around Mrs. Lenoir\u0027s waist, he turned his back upon his father, and took the road which justice pointed out to him. \n * * * * * * \n \n But a short distance from the country place in which Seth Dumbrick and the children of his adoption spent their holiday, is a pretty and comfortable residence standing in its own grounds. Here lives Nelly Marston and her daughter, no longer bearing the name of the Duchess of Rosemary Lane, but the more simple and natural one of Kate. Happily the faults of our young heroine are not uneradicable, and under the loving ministration of her devoted mother she is gradually developing a sweetness and simplicity of nature which will bear good fruit in the future. The long-suffering mother is happy beyond her wildest hopes, and night and morning she bends her knees in gratitude, and offers up prayers of thankfulness for the life of love she is enjoying. That she is enabled to live this life in ease and comfort is due to Arthur Temple, who, having some private fortune of his own through a legacy left to him in childhood, is able in this way to make some compensation to the trusting woman whom his father betrayed. He comes to the happy home at intervals, and calls Kate his sister, and pays to Kates\u0027 mother a respect in which something of reverence finds a place. To this home, also, every fortnight, come Seth Dumbrick and Sally, from Saturday afternoon to Monday morning, and at rarer intervals Nelly Marston and her daughter pay visits to Rosemary Lane, and pass happy hours in Seth\u0027s cellar. \n \n So much for the present. What lies in the future? \n \n It may be that Arthur Temple and his father may become reconciled, but the old ties are broken, and in the son\u0027s future the father shall play no part. The father\u0027s head is no longer erect and proud: his sin has found him out, and his dearest hopes are crushed. It is just. \n \n It may be that our heroine may meet with a man who will woo her honourably, and that when she has children of her own, the better lessons which her mother is imparting will prove to be indeed the best blessing which could fall to her lot. \n \n But it cannot be that Nelly Marston\u0027s happiness shall be greater than it is at present. It is full and perfect, and the past is atoned for. Despite the verdict which too censorious people might pass upon her, Nelly Marston\u0027s home is a home of innocence and virtue. \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1679/49507.html","bookId":1173,"book":{"id":1173,"title":"The Duchess of Rosemary Lane","description":"简介： This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.
