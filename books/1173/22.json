{"id":27291,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII.","content":"The second day\u0027s journey was as delightful as the first. The weather continued fine, and Seth Dumbrick, recovering his spirits, did his best to entertain the children, to whom the ride itself would have been a sufficiently satisfying enjoyment. During the day Seth confided his plans to the good-natured wagoner, and his desire to obtain cheap lodgings for a few days for himself and the children at some modest cottage in the country. \"Would near the seaside suit you?\" asked the wagoner. \"Capitally,\" replied Seth; \"but your place lies inland.\" \"I have time to go a little out of my way, and will take you to a cottage near the sea belonging to a friend of mine, who\u0027ll be able to lodge you reasonable.\" \"Nothing could be better,\" said Seth, thankfully. \"It\u0027s obliging her and you, and won\u0027t trouble me much. Come up, Daisy! Now then, Cornflower! Four mile more for you, and plenty of time to do it in.\" If Daisy and Cornflower understood that an additional task was imposed upon them they did not take it sadly, but shook their bells briskly and trotted out of their regular track with a willing spirit. \"Round this bend,\" said the wagoner, \"and a fine stretch of the sea\u0027ll be before us.\" It appeared almost incredible, for the trees and hedges in the path they were riding along were so thick and the path itself so winding as to obscure the view. \"The children have never seen the sea,\" said Seth. \"You don\u0027t say so! Well, I wouldn\u0027t be a Londoner, bound to live there all my days, for the best fifty houses you could offer me. And never seen a ship sailing, I\u0027ll be bound!\" \"Never.\" \"It will be something for them to remember, then. Now, shut your eyes, my little lasses, and don\u0027t open them till I say \u0027Presto!\u0027\" Sally and the Duchess shut their eyes tight, their hearts throbbing with eager expectation. \"Up then, Daisy! Up, Cornflower! Round the bend we go. Presto!\" The Duchess and Sally opened their eyes and uttered exclamations of delight. The glorious sea lay before them, with large ships in the distance and fishing boats in the foreground. In one part the sun, playing on the water, transformed it into an island of flashing jewels. It was a veritable wonderland to the children--a dream of beauty never to be forgotten. \"Do I see the waves creeping up, Sally?\" asked Seth, gaily. Sally raised her face to his and kissed him. \"It\u0027s all through that money that was sent to the Duchess, Daddy.\" \"All through that, Sally.\" \"Then I love money, Daddy,\" said Sally; \"and I\u0027d like to be a lady, so that the Duchess and me might live always by the sea. How far does it stretch? More than we can see?\" \"Thousands, and thousands, and thousands of miles more. Away into other countries, where it\u0027s night at the present moment while it\u0027s daylight here.\" \"I don\u0027t understand it,\" said Sally, with a sigh of ecstasy, \"and I don\u0027t want to. Oh, we\u0027re going away from it!\" \"We\u0027re going to the cottage I spoke of my little woman,\" said the wagoner; \"it\u0027s not three hundred yards off--just down this lane.\" Down the lane they drove, and drew up at a small house with a garden before and behind. The front of the cottage was covered with ivy, and the windows in their framework of glossy leaves looked wonderfully pretty. \"This is nice, too,\" said Sally, disposed to enjoy everything. \"There\u0027s beauty everywhere, Sally,\" said Seth, with a touch of his old philosophy, \"if we\u0027ll only look out for it.\" \"This comes without looking out for it,\" replied Sally; \"and that\u0027s why I like it. Ain\u0027t it better than anything ever was, Duchess?\" The Duchess nodded an assent, and in another moment the whole party were in the little parlour, and Seth and the wagoner were talking to the mistress of the house. The bargain was soon struck, the terms asked for board and lodging being much less than Seth had ventured to hope they would be. They were to have the two rooms on the first floor for sleeping apartments, one looking over the front the other over the back of the house. \"Daddy must have this,\" said Sally, as they stood in the front room; \"it\u0027s the best.\" \"That\u0027s the reason why you and the Duchess shall sleep in it. I came into the country for your sakes, children, not for my own.\" Everything in the place was sweet and fresh; and the garden at the back of the house contained apple and pear trees and currant-bushes, as well as flowers. \"My good man,\" said the mistress, \"will be glad to have two such pretty children in the house for a little while. We\u0027ve none of our own. It\u0027ll brighten us up a bit.\" The woman was sad-looking and spoke in a sad tone; and Sally wondered how it was possible that one who lived in the fairy-house, with flowers and fruit trees and the sea within a stone\u0027s throw of them, should need brightening up. She was sure if such a paradise were hers, that there would never be a dull hour in it. While the woman was attending to the children upstairs, assisting them to wash after their long day\u0027s ride, and showing them all the wonders of the fairy house, Seth and the wagoner had a conversation in the room below. It was a friendly one, resulting from the wagoner\u0027s refusal to accept payment for the ride. \"It\u0027ll be a pleasure to me,\" said the wagoner, \"not to take the money. I don\u0027t want it, having enough and to spare, as I\u0027ve already told you. I don\u0027t mean to say I do it for your sake----\" \"Not likely,\" said Seth, good-humouredly. \"--But for the sake of the pretty little one you call the Duchess. And that\u0027s puzzled me. I\u0027d take it as a favour if you\u0027d tell me, why Duchess?\" \"Well, it was a fancy of Sally\u0027s,\" said Seth, \"who worships the Duchess----\" \"It\u0027s plain enough that she thinks a mighty deal more of her than she does of herself.\" \"That she does. Well, the Duchess came to me in a strange way that\u0027ll take too long to explain here. The child was left in our neighbourhood in a most mysterious manner--brought in mysteriously, deserted mysteriously. She and Sally were thrown together, and Sally adopted her, if one helpless mite can be said to adopt another helpless mite. Sally\u0027s mother fell into misfortune, and the children happened to drop in my way. Sally had a name--the other one didn\u0027t--and one night we had a curious little party of children in my cellar----\" \"In your cellar?\" \"I live in a cellar in Rosemary Lane--and Sally, quite seriously, put the fancy in my head of calling the child the Duchess of our quarter. All the neighbours take to it kindly, and everyone that knows her loves her. Look there. Who could help being attracted to her?\" The wagoner looked up at the window of the children\u0027s room, and saw the Duchess standing within a framework of dark-green ivy leaves. The light was shining full upon her beautiful face, and touched, also, the darker face of Sally, who stood at the back of the Duchess, looking over her shoulder. \"It\u0027s a picture one don\u0027t often see,\" said the wagoner, with a thoughtful air; \"but if I had my choice of the two girls for a daughter, I reckon I\u0027d choose the dark-skinned one.\" It did not displease Seth to hear this, for Sally and the Duchess really occupied an equal place in his heart. If the beauty of the Duchess awoke the tenderness of his nature, the devotion, unselfishness, and many rare qualities displayed by Sally were no less powerful in their effect upon his sympathies. Bearing in mind the scene that had occurred at Springfield on the preceding evening, he asked the wagoner, if any inquiries were made of him, not to divulge where he and the children were rusticating. \"I\u0027ve brought them into the country,\" he said, \"as much for peace and quietness as for fresh air.\" There was to the wagoner\u0027s mind something suspicious both in the words and the nervous manner in which Seth made the request. He showed in his countenance the impression he received, and Seth, wishing to stand well with him, gave an account of the incident which had so disturbed him. \"When I heard the lady say she would like to buy my child,\" he said, in conclusion, \"it seemed to me that she had so much faith in the power of money, and so little in the power of love, that I could not keep my temper. I spoke hotly, and with reason, I think.\" \"It would have roused my blood,\" responded the wagoner; \"you never saw any of the gentlefolk before?\" \"Never, and I never wish to see them again. I said as much to the master of Springfield, if I\u0027m not mistaken.\" \"From what I\u0027ve heard of him, he\u0027s not a man either to forget or forgive.\" \"You\u0027ll promise me, then, for the sake of the children, not to set any one on our track?\" He spoke anxiously, his fears exaggerating a danger which, in all likelihood was wholly imaginary. \"Yes,\" replied the wagoner, \"there\u0027s no harm in promising. They\u0027ve no right to worry you, as far as I can see, and they sha\u0027n\u0027t get me to put them in the way of it. How long are you going to stop here?\" \"We can live here so cheaply,\" said Seth, with a lightened heart, \"that my purse will hold out for two or three weeks; we\u0027ll stay that time, I dare say.\" \"I\u0027ll be going up to London about then, mayhap,\" said the wagoner; \"if so, I\u0027ll be glad to give the little lasses a lift; and mayhap I may be passing this way in a few days with the wagon. A ride through the lanes will do them no harm.\" Seth expressed his thanks to the kind-hearted old fellow, and they shook hands and parted, the wagoner smiling goodbye to the children, who stood at the window watching him until he was out of sight. Then commenced a happy time. The children were in a new world, and the little cottage, with its bit of garden back and front, was a very heaven to them. Everything was so new and bright, the air was so sweet, the trees and flowers so beautiful, that Sally could scarcely believe it was all real. On the first night, when they were abed, listening to the strange sound of the waves beating on the shore, Sally whispered to the Duchess: \"Isn\u0027t it lovely, Duchess?\" \"Yes, oh, yes,\" sighed the Duchess; and this precise form of words was used at least a dozen times, each time with the belief that it embodied an observation of an especially original nature. Once Sally, creeping out of bed, drew aside the snowy white curtains from the window and looked out. \"Oh, come, Duchess, come!\" she cried, and the Duchess scrambled after her. It was full moon, and the glorious light shining on the trees and hedges was a vision of beauty to them. \"That\u0027s a different moon from the one we\u0027ve got in Rosemary Lane,\" said Sally; \"I wish we could take it back with us.\" \"Are we going back?\" asked the Duchess regretfully. Sally did not reply. The prospect was too distressing. But she was happily so constituted as to be grateful for present joys and pleasures, and she dismissed Rosemary Lane from her thoughts. Her one fear was that she would wake up. \"Do you like the noise the sea makes?\" she inquires of her idol, when they were in bed again. \"It\u0027s beautiful,\" said the Duchess. \"Are the ships there?\" Sally never hesitated to impart information on subjects of which she was ignorant. \"They\u0027re there,\" she said, \"but they don\u0027t move till daylight comes.\" \"I\u0027m sleepy,\" said the Duchess, with a yawn. \"I\u0027m frightened to go to sleep,\" said Sally, battling with fatigue; \"I want to be like this always. I hope it ain\u0027t a dream--oh, I hope it ain\u0027t a dream!\" Before she had finished, the Duchess was asleep. \"I\u0027ll pinch myself hard,\" thought Sally, \"as hard as I can, and if there\u0027s a black-and-blue mark on my arm to-morrow morning, I shall know it\u0027s real.\" Sally did pinch herself--so hard that she could not help crying out with the pain, but she obtained her reward on the following morning, when she saw the black-and-blue marks. The joy of the day, however, was so great that as she sat on the pebbly beach, watching the waves creep up and the ships and fishing-boats floating away into wonderland, she found it hard to convince herself that she was not dreaming. At the end of the week she said to Seth: \"Daddy, every night I go to bed, I am frightened that I shall wake up and find myself in Rosemary Lane.\" Thereupon he read her and the Duchess a lecture on contentment and gratitude, not so much needed by Sally as by the Duchess. \"I know you\u0027re right,\" said Sally; \"it will always be a pleasure to think of, but I shall be awful sorry too, that it didn\u0027t last for ever. It can\u0027t, Daddy, can it?\" \"No, my dear, it can\u0027t.\" \"I wish I was rich,\" sighed Sally. \"Supposing you had lived a hundred years ago,\" suggested Seth, with grave humour; and paused. \"Well, Daddy. Supposing I did?\" \"It would be all the same to you whether you had a hundred boxes full of gold or whether you had twopence-halfpenny.\" Sally was shrewd enough to understand this without having to ask for an explanation. \"What do you say to it all?\" asked Sally of the Duchess. \"I don\u0027t care for a hundred years ago,\" said the Duchess; \"I don\u0027t know what it means. I care for Now.\" And she echoed Sally\u0027s words, \"I wish I was rich.\" This set Seth pondering, and in his endeavour to extract honey out of unpromising material and to improve the occasion, it is to be feared that he soared above the understanding of his children. In this way: \"Did I ever tell you, Sally\"--he always appealed to Sally at such times, although he addressed both her and the Duchess--\"of a man I once knew called Billy Spike?\" \"No, Daddy.\" \"He was a friend of mine a good many years ago. Older than me by thirty years was Billy Spike--and he was always Billy, never William, to the day of his death. Nearly everybody who knew him thought he was crazy.\" \"Why?\" \"Because of one thing he was never tired of saying, \u0027What I don\u0027t get is profit.\u0027 That\u0027s what sweetened the world for Billy Spike. \u0027What I don\u0027t get is profit,\u0027 was always on his lips.\" \"Was he a rich man, Daddy?\" \"I doubt if Billy Spike ever had twenty shillings in his pocket at one time. I doubt if ever he had a new suit of clothes to his back. I doubt if he ever had quite as much to eat as he could have taken in. He was as poor as a church-mouse.\" \"Why is a church-mouse poor?\" asked practical Sally. \"It\u0027s no use my trying to explain that, Sally. It\u0027s a saying, and a true one I dare say. But about Billy Spike. He was the poorest and the happiest man in the world, and all the philosophy of life was contained in his saying, \u0027What I don\u0027t get is profit.\u0027 \u0027Billy,\u0027 I said to him, \u0027what do you mean by it?\u0027 He looked at me with his eyes twinkling. \u0027Seth Dumbrick,\u0027 said he, \u0027you\u0027re a man of sense. Look at me. Here I am.\u0027 And he stood up straight before me, showing large holes in his coat, under his arms, and being generally a picture of rags. \u0027If,\u0027 said I, \u0027all the profit you make comes from what you\u0027ve got, and not from what you haven\u0027t got, your returns must be small.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve got a pair of arms, Seth Dumbrick,\u0027 said Billy. \u0027Thank you for nothing,\u0027 said I. \u0027You call that nothing!\u0027 cried Billy. \u0027Wait a bit. My limbs are all sound, my eyesight\u0027s good. I never had a headache or a toothache in my life, and I sleep like a top. Now, tell me who\u0027s that crossing the road?\u0027 It was a sailor we knew who hopped through life on a wooden leg. Me and Billy and the wooden-legged sailor went and had a glass together, and Billy drew the sailor out to tell us all about the miseries of having only one leg--what shootings he had in the one that was chopped off--yes, he said that, Sally, though it does sound funny--and how he couldn\u0027t walk where he wanted to walk, and couldn\u0027t do what he wanted to do, all through having a wooden leg. It was plain enough that his wooden leg made him real unhappy and miserable. When he was gone Billy Spike said to me, with a wink, \u0027What I don\u0027t get is profit: I don\u0027t get wooden legs.\u0027 Just then we saw a woman that we knew; her face was twice its proper size, and she had a bandage round it. \u0027What\u0027s the matter, mother?\u0027 asked Billy Spike. \u0027I\u0027m almost dead with the pain, Billy,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ve been and had two of my teeth out at the hospital and the doctor\u0027s almost broke my jaw. It\u0027s enough to drive a poor woman mad.\u0027 \u0027The toothache is,\u0027 said Billy. \u0027Yes, the toothache,\u0027 said she; \u0027I\u0027ve had it on and off for the last twenty years, and I\u0027m pretty well crazed with it.\u0027 Billy Spike winked at me again. \u0027What I don\u0027t get is profit. I don\u0027t get toothaches.\u0027 Then we came across a blind man, and Billy drew him out, and a pretty bad case it was. \u0027I\u0027d sooner be dead than alive,\u0027 said he. He couldn\u0027t see the wink that Billy gave. What I don\u0027t get is profit,\u0027 said Billy. \u0027I don\u0027t get blind.\u0027 And so Billy would have gone on all the day, I don\u0027t doubt, if I hadn\u0027t already caught his meaning.\" In which respect Seth had the advantage of those to whom he was relating, as a possibly useful lesson, this story of Billy Spike\u0027s philosophy. Sally\u0027s face denoted that she did not see the application, and the Duchess said again, \"I wish I was rich.\" So Seth resolved to throw aside philosophy as not suitable for the occasion, and to devote himself entirely to pleasure. It was none the less sweet because it was taken in a modest humble way, and because it cost but little money. Country walks, rides in carts and wagons, generally given for nothing--for the beauty of the Duchess soon attracted admirers even in this out-of-the-way spot--frolics in hayfields, rambles by the seaside, fully occupied their hours, and did not afford opportunity for a moment\u0027s weariness. And one day a travelling photographer passed their road and offered to \"take\" the Duchess for a song, as the saying is. Being an artist he saw the value of Seth\u0027s suggestion that she should be taken standing in a framework of ivy leaves, and the prettiest of pictures was produced. The photographer, falling in love with his work, and seeing future profit in it, took negatives of the Duchess in various attitudes, she falling into them so naturally as to excite his wonder and admiration. In truth it was a task which pleased and delighted her. Seth, shrewd as he always was, and careful of his pocket as he was compelled to be, made a good bargain with the artist, and for a very small sum obtained copies of all their portraits: the Duchess in three different positions, Sally in one, Sally and the Duchess together, and lastly, himself with the children on either side of him. The day following this excitement another pleasure came. The old wagoner who had driven them from London arrived early in the morning with Daisy and Cornflower, and after giving them the most beautiful ride in their holiday, took them to his own cottage where he had lived from boyhood. There his old wife awaited them, and feasted the party to their hearts\u0027 content, and a peaceful ride back in the peaceful night was the fitting ending to the happy day. So the time passed on until one morning Seth said to Sally. \"Home to-morrow, Sally.\" She sighed with grateful regret. \"Our little girl is better than ever she was,\" he continued, with a fond look at the Duchess, \"and we\u0027ll endeavour to keep her so. Such roses as these\"--caressing the Duchess\u0027s cheek--\"will be something for the Rosemary Lane folk to stare at. They\u0027ve never seen such bright ones before. We\u0027ve had a happy time, haven\u0027t we?\" \"Yes, yes,\" they both replied, nestling to him. \"Let us be thankful, then----\" \"For what we haven\u0027t had?\" asked Sally, with a sly look. \"No,\" he said with a laugh, \"for what we have enjoyed;\" adding in a graver tone, \"I never thought the world was so good as it is.\" On the second evening from this they returned to Rosemary Lane, and were received with smiles and hearty welcome by all.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1679/49494.html","bookId":1173,"book":{"id":1173,"title":"The Duchess of Rosemary Lane","description":"简介： This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.
