{"id":27275,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER II.","content":"In the year 1848, Europe was convulsed with civil war. Firebrands were abundant, but not more abundant than the hands ready to use them. Red was the favourite colour, and blood and fire supplied it freely. The gutters ran with the stream of the one, and the heavens reflected the glare of the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a time of solemn awful tragedies. And because the gutters were not purified when the blood was cleared away, men despaired who had grasped at shadows. And because the heavens were bright and fair when the dreadful glare had died out of them, milder theorists still hoped that the day would come when their dreams should be realised. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was to be a monster meeting at Bonner\u0027s Fields, and the inhabitants of Rosemary Lane and the surrounding neighbourhood flocked to the spot made historically famous by the bishop who played his ruthless part in the reign of bloody Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n Troops were massed to meet the mob, but happily there was little need for them. Copious and beneficent showers of rain spoilt the bad promise of the day. Back to their homes went the idlers; for, indeed, there was little of serious purpose in ninety-nine out of every hundred who assembled; and the arm of the law came down lightly, comparatively few persons being arrested. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the evening Rosemary Lane was exceedingly animated. There was more light in the Royal George than in all the private houses within a radius of five hundred yards. This particular gin palace was a grand stone building, abounding in bright glass and gilt cornices, and it was situated within a short distance of the residence of Mr. Richard Chester, who for a sufficient reason, was not at the present moment one of the throng there assembled. He was at home, beating his wife, who happened to be possessed of fifteen pence. \\n\\n \\n\\n He employed all his arts to wheedle the money out of his wife; but she was firm and would not be wheedled. He even rehearsed a speech on liberty, which he was burning to deliver at the Royal George. It had no more effect upon her than if she had been a dummy woman. Mr. Chester took a strap into his hand and drew it between his palms. Mrs. Chester held her breath, and bit her lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must have it, old woman,\" he said, in a musing tone. \"Liberty soars upon heavenly wings, and cries for----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gin!\" interrupted Mrs. Chester, with scornful emphasis. \\n\\n \\n\\n He flourished his strap, and brought it down upon her shoulders. The stroke was neither savage nor vindictive, and seemed to be administered more in sorrow than in anger. Yet she cried, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O Dick!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come,\" he said, persuasively, \"the money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may beat me black and blue,\" she replied \"but you\u0027ll get no money out of me to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t I!\" exclaimed the tipsy humourist, as he flourished his strap, and brought it down again. \"Take that, and that, and that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His wife took that, and that, and that, meekly, so far as her outward manner denoted. She was really not hurt much, for his blows were light; but the tears gathered in her eyes, as she asked: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know why, if you killed me I would not give you the money?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because you\u0027re an obstinate woman,\" he replied, with hand upraised. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because I want it for medicine, for Sally.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this point the door of the room opened, and two persons appeared--a man, certainly wide awake and a very little girl, certainly almost fast asleep, holding on to the skirts of his coat. No sooner did the man pause on the right side of the door, than the child converted \"almost\" into \"quite.\" With a bit of his coat tightly clasped in her little hand, she closed her eyes and went to sleep, using his leg as a resting place for her head. The one candle which lighted the room showed dimly the form of the man but the child, being exceedingly small, was hidden from the Chesters in the shadows which lay upon the floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n The intruder, at a glance, recognised the position of affairs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t mind me,\" he said with a coarse laugh, \"this is a free country.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you want here?\" demanded Mr. Chester angrily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got a bedroom to let; I made out the bill in the window----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, just you wait a bit.\" He turned to his wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter with Sally?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s took ill again. She fainted dead away again this afternoon, all of a sudden, and Dr. Lyons says she must have strengthening things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Utterly forgetting her declaration that if her husband killed her she would not give him the money, Mrs. Chester dragged the fifteen pence out of her pocket, and flinging it upon the table, cried passionately: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take it! and drink the child\u0027s life away!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not quite so bad as that, old woman,\" he said, in a shame-faced tone, \"I\u0027ve enough to reproach myself with one. Is Sal asleep?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His question was answered by the pattering of two little bare feet, and Sally herself appeared from an inner room, which, with the parlour in which this scene was taking place, formed the domestic establishment of the Chester family. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, father, I\u0027m not asleep,\" cried Sally, as she ran. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sally was only five years of age, and was such a mite of a child that she might have been no age at all. Waking suddenly, she had scrambled out of bed on hearing her father\u0027s voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You parcel of bones!\" exclaimed Mr. Chester, with rough tenderness, lifting the child in his arms. \"What have you been up to again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I fainted dead away, father!\" replied Sally, gleefully; \"dead away!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The proud tone in which, in her thin shrill voice, she made this evidently familiar statement respecting herself was very remarkable. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Sally, you\u0027re always at it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, father,\" said Sally, with a triumphant laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But,\" said Mr. Chester, \"if you go on fainting away like this, Sally, one of these days you\u0027ll faint so dead away that you\u0027ll never come to again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This conveyed no terrors to Sally\u0027s mind, for she clapped her bony hands in delight at the idea. She stopped in the midst of her clapping, and struggling out of her father\u0027s arms, ran to the sleeping child, and gazed earnestly at the pretty face. Following Sally\u0027s movements, Mr. and Mrs. Chester saw for the first time that the man who had intruded upon them was not alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two children presented a notable contrast. Sally had not a spare ounce of flesh upon her body; the newcomer was plump, and her limbs were well proportioned. Sally was dark and sallow; the newcomer was fair, and despite her weariness, there were roses in her cheeks. Sally\u0027s hair was black, and hung straight in lank disorder about her forehead; the newcomer\u0027s hair was flaxen, and hung about her forehead in naturally-graceful curls. She was like one of Raphael\u0027s angels, fresh from heaven; Sally was like an elf from dark woods. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sally gazed upon the sleeping girl in solemn wonder and admiration, and presently put forward one of her fingers and touched the rosy cheek--drawing it quickly back, as though it were a presumptuous thing to do. Again she stretched forth her hand, and played with the flaxen curls. Then, emboldened by success, Sally wetted her forefinger on her tongue, and rubbed it softly up and down over the roses in the sleeping child\u0027s face. That, when she looked at her finger after this operation, there was no red upon it, was evidently a puzzle to Sally. Her next proceeding was to take the sleeping child\u0027s plump hand in her bony one, and make an examination of the fat little fingers, separating them one by one, and curiously comparing them with her own. While thus employed Sally happened to glance up at the man, and, meeting his eyes, her arm stole round the sleeping child\u0027s neck. The next moment Sally was sitting on the floor, nursing the new little girl on her lap. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sally had had her dreams, as all children have--bright dreams of flowers, and gardens, and light, and colour, and beautiful shapes--of dolls with pink faces and spangled silk dresses--but never, in her wildest fancies, had she compassed the possession of such a lovely doll as this she now nursed in her lap. She had never seen anything so sweetly exquisite, and she sat in her thin night-dress, poor wan little elf, rocking her new treasure, and fondling it in purest delight. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Chester gazed at the children, and her tender heart began to bleed. That this strange child should be so beautiful, and rosy, and plump, and her child so forlorn-looking, and pale, and thin, smote her with keenest pain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get up from the cold floor, Sally!\" she cried; \"you\u0027ll catch your death setting there with nothing on!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sally staggered to her feet, with the little stranger in her arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mercy take the child!\" cried Mrs. Chester, still more crossly. \"You\u0027ll let her fall! Here, give her to me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Sally, heavy as her burden was, held her precious possession close to her, and managed to reach the bedroom door, where she stood still awhile. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Chester brought affairs to some sort of a climax. He looked at the silver shilling and the few coppers upon the table, and his hand stole slowly towards them; but happening to look over his shoulder at Sally, he swiftly withdrew his hand, and left the money undisturbed. Then he turned abruptly to the stranger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, then,\" said he, \"what\u0027s your name when you are at home?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When I\u0027m at home I\u0027ll tell you,\" replied the stranger. \"Let\u0027s come to business. You\u0027ve got a bedroom to let. What\u0027s the rent of it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Three shillings a week. Respectable references, of course?\" inquired Mr. Chester, vaguely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stuff!\" exclaimed the stranger, taking some silver pieces from his pocket. \"Here\u0027s my reference.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a bad one,\" said Mr. Chester, \"but I shall require two weeks in advance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here you are,\" said the stranger, counting out six shillings into Mr. Chester\u0027s hand. \"And that\u0027s settled.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not so fast; you\u0027re a stranger to us, and a man\u0027s got to be careful what kind of people he takes into his house. You see, you\u0027re not alone. You bring a little girl with you, and we\u0027ve got one of our own already. Now we don\u0027t wish to be left with another on our hands that don\u0027t rightly belong to us. Children are no rarity round about in these parts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sally, by this time, had found her burden too heavy for her, and the baby-child, with her golden curls and perfectly beautiful features, was now lying on the ground, and Sally was bending over her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Chester, who had thrown a thin shawl over Sally, listened to the conversation with interest. She was glad to let her room, but she could not make up her mind as to the character of her new tenant. He was a tall spare man, with thin yellow whiskers and light-grey eyes. His hands were somewhat delicately shaped, and his nails were in good condition, denoting that he was not a common workman, nor one who gained a livelihood by manual labour. His clothes were shabby, and an air of shabby refinement pervaded him. Mrs. Chester was puzzled what to think of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to be left with her on your hands?\" exclaimed the stranger boisterously. \"Not a likely thing that. Why, every hair of the darling\u0027s head is as precious to me as--as----\" Not being able to find an appropriate simile, he gave it up, and continued--\"Look there. Your little girl seems to have taken a fancy to--to--my little girl. They\u0027ll be company for each other. I warrant, if I tried to take her upstairs to bed now, Sally would begin to cry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was wrong. Sally did not cry as the stranger approached her, but standing, with flashing eyes before her treasure, she struck at him viciously with her little fists. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t I tell you?\" inquired the stranger of Mr. Chester, without ill-humour. \"Sally\u0027s a game little bird. What do you say to letting the children sleep together, just for this night? To-morrow we\u0027ll make things straight and comfortable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" replied Mr. Chester, anxious to be off. \"The old woman\u0027ll see to that. You come along with me now, and have a glass at the Royal George. Goodnight, Sally. Give us a kiss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He stooped to Sally\u0027s face, and kissed her. With her arms round his neck, she pulled him to his knees, and made him kiss the sleeping child on the ground. Then, when he raised his face, she kissed him again, and with her mouth close to his, inhaled his breath, and exclaimed: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, shouldn\u0027t I like some to drink! I can only smell it now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Like some what, Sally?\" asked the stranger, as in a shame-faced way, Mr. Chester turned from his child. \"Some gin,\" answered Sally, with a smack of her lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Chester rose to his feet, with a rueful look. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Give me a kiss, too, Sally,\" said the stranger; \"I\u0027m fond of game little girls.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Sally was not to be won over, and when the stranger tried to force the kiss from her, she dug her fingers into his sandy whiskers with such spiteful intention that he was glad to free himself from her clutches. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There, get out!\" cried Mrs. Chester. \"Can\u0027t you see the child don\u0027t want to have anything to do with you? You\u0027ll find your bed ready when you come home, which I expect won\u0027t be till you\u0027re turned out of the Royal George. Dick\u0027ll show you your room.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She caught up the sleeping child, and taking the candle, retired to the inner room, driving Sally before her. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1679/49478.html","bookId":1173,"book":{"id":1173,"title":"The Duchess of Rosemary Lane","description":"简介： This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.
