{"id":27289,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XVI.","content":"The following day a sensation was created in Rosemary Lane by the circumstance of Seth Dumbrick\u0027s stall being closed, and by a written notice pasted outside, to the effect that he might be expected to return in the course of two or three weeks. \"From the day as Seth Dumbrick give that party to the children,\" said Mrs. Preedy, holding forth in front of the cellar to a knot of eager listeners, \"down in that cellar\"--with finger ominously pointing--\"from that day I begun to suspect him, and to feel sure as there was something wrong I says to him on that very day, Strange things is often done down in cellars,\u0027 says I; and then I told him that I wouldn\u0027t let my Jane go to his party unless I were invited, no, not if he filled my apron with diamings. \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 says I, with mind full of misbegivings, \u0027perhaps you\u0027ve got ghosts and skiletons down in your cellar, Mr. Dumbrick;\u0027 and as true as I\u0027m a living woman, he says to me upon that, \u0027My cellar is full of ghosts, Mrs. Preedy,\u0027 says he; \u0027my cellar is full of ghosts,\u0027 he says.\" This narrative imparted a more intense interest to the position of affairs, and imagination ran riot on the contents of the cellar, which became gradually filled with the bones and limbs of murdered persons--Seth Dumbrick\u0027s victims, who had been artfully decoyed down the steps and made away with. \"And it shows the wickedness of mankind,\" said one woman, especially disposed to the horrible, \"to think of the way he\u0027s kept it secret all this time.\" Other imaginative phases relating to Sally and the Duchess, who were pictured as being either murdered or chained to the wall and left to starve, soon became popular; and ears were pressed to the shutters to catch the groans of the children. \"I can hear something!\" cried Mrs. Preedy; which instantly caused the knot of women to declare that, for humanity\u0027s sake, the cellar should be broken into and the children rescued. Whether they would have proceeded to this extremity is not certain, and perhaps it was fortunate that the form of Dr. Lyon was at that moment seen approaching them. \"O doctor! O doctor!\" cried Mrs. Preedy; and stood before him, pressing her sides, and gasping for breath in her agitation. \"What\u0027s the matter, Mrs. Preedy?\" asked the doctor. \"Spasms?\" \"No, sir; oh! no, sir,\" she replied, still palpitating. \"The children! the children!\" \"What children?\" \"Our beautiful Duchess, sir, and Sally, that we\u0027re all so fond on!\" \"Well?\" \"Down there, sir! Murdered! I heard a groan jest as you come up.\" \"Which proves,\" said the doctor, realising the position of affairs, \"that they can\u0027t be murdered. Mrs. Preedy, do you read your Bible?\" \"I hope so, sir, I\u0027m sure,\" answered Mrs. Preedy in a tone of virtuous injury. \"I hope so too. Do you forget what it says? \u0027Do unto others as you would others should do unto you.\u0027 Seth Dumbrick has gone into the country with the children, for the sake of the Duchess, who needs fresh air to bring her back to health. And here\u0027s the key of his place, which he left with me early this morning. Let me give you a piece of advice, Mrs. Preedy.\" \"I shall be very grateful, sir, I\u0027m sure,\" murmured Mrs. Preedy, trembling, not knowing what trouble she might have brought upon herself. \"Go home, then,\" said the doctor in a grave tone, \"and for the future attend more to your own affairs and less to other people\u0027s. In plainer words, mind your own business.\" \"Well, I\u0027m sure!\" gasped Mrs. Preedy, as Dr. Lyon stalked away. But she obtained no sympathy from her neighbours, who were only too ready to lay the blame on some one, and who, with justice--for she was the most zealous scandalmonger in Rosemary Lane--laid it upon Mrs. Preedy\u0027s shoulders. So that for once the right scapegoat suffered. Mrs. Preedy went home in an oppressed state of mind, a sadder if not a wiser woman; and the neighbours generally, to show how guiltless they were, became enthusiastic in their praises of Seth Dumbrick; though it must be confessed they bore him in their hearts a little grudge for having disappointed them of a grand and awful sensation. In the meantime, unconscious of the excitement he had created, Seth Dumbrick, with the Duchess and Sally by his side, was sitting on the top of an empty wagon returning to the country, with the driver of which he had bargained for the ride. It was a fine day, and the delight of the children was unbounded. The fresh air, the clear atmosphere, the dreamy clouds, the beautiful fields, were revelations to them. Occasionally they passed an estate, stone-walled from vulgar eyes, over which, being seated at such an elevation, they could see into the carefully-tended gardens and orchards; and more frequently they passed the prettiest of gardens belonging to humbler folk, the colour and beauty of which were as lovely and charming as Nature could produce, to gladden heart and eye. The driver of the wagon was in no hurry; he had some sixty miles to go, and he worked for no hard taskmaster; he was an old man, and merciful to his cattle, having a love for them, as could easily be seen--all of which circumstances were as precious as gold to the holiday-seekers, for it gave them leisure to see and enjoy. The wagon was a new wagon, of which Seth made joyous capital, saying it had been built especially for them to ride in on this brightest of all bright days. Overhearing the remark, the driver said that that was a likely thing, too, for things happened pretty much as they were ordained to happen--leastways, that was his experience; and said it as though he had high authority for the doctrine. The bells on the harness supplied the music, varying most delightfully according to the pace; for, to please the children, the old driver occasionally smartened the horses into a trot, which they appeared to enjoy as much as they enjoyed the leisurely amble with which they traversed the greater part of the road. He was a kindly old fellow, with a face like a ribstone pippin, and with hands as hard and brown as knotted oak--hands which could be soft and gentle, also, and were, when he pinched the cheek of the Duchess. She, always susceptible to fondling and caressing, looked into the old man\u0027s face and smiled, so winsomely as to make him pensive. \"Yours?\" he inquired of Seth Dumbrick. \"No,\" replied Seth, in a low tone, so that the children should not hear; \"not exactly. I\u0027ve adopted her. An orphan.\" \"Ah!\" said the driver; \"then she\u0027s yours;\" glancing at Sally. \"No, I\u0027ve no children of my own.\" \"Never been married?\" \"No. You\u0027re a family man, I can see.\" \"Thirteen of \u0027em;\" adding, in response to the look of astonishment on Seth\u0027s face, \"Not too many, not one too many.\" \"Are they all at home?\" asked Seth. \"No; they\u0027re here and there;\" with a wave of his hands cloudwards, sufficiently comprehensive to denote that his brood were scattered over the face of the earth. \"We\u0027re a travelling family, you see. I\u0027ve been a wagoner ever since I was a lad. My youngsters took after me, and travelled further--two to America, one to China, one to Australia; and another\"--this with a wistful look into the clouds, yearningly eager to fix the spot--\"God knows where. But,\" he added, with a brighter air, \"they\u0027re all doing well, most of \u0027em. I\u0027ve no occasion to work, but I couldn\u0027t live without a whip. I\u0027d like to die with one in my hand. Then, I love the English roads. You\u0027re fond of \u0027em, too, I can see.\" \"They are very beautiful,\" said Seth, \"to us especially, who see but little of \u0027em. I haven\u0027t been out of London for fifteen years. And this little girl\"--with a kindly pressure of Sally\u0027s arm--\"has never in her life seen the country till now.\" Sally\u0027s eyes sparkled a rapturous confirmation. This holiday was, indeed, a revelation to her soul; she saw beauty of which she had hitherto had no knowledge or comprehension; and as she sat on the wagon, with one arm fondly caressing the Duchess, whose head was lying on her bosom, she wished that she and those she loved could go jogging along in this way for ever and ever.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1679/49492.html","bookId":1173,"book":{"id":1173,"title":"The Duchess of Rosemary Lane","description":"简介： This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.
