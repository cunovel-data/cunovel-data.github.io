{"id":33509,"no":1,"title":"HARPER’S FAMILY LIBRARY.","content":"DESIGNED FOR ADULT PERSONS. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Books that you may carry to the fire, and hold readily in your hand, are the most useful after all. A man will often look at them, and be tempted to go on, when he would have been frightened at books of a larger size, and of a more erudite appearance.”—Dr. Johnson. \\n\\n \\n\\n The proprietors of the Family Library feel themselves stimulated to increased exertions by the distinguished favour with which it has already been received. \\n\\n \\n\\n The volumes now before the public may be confidently appealed to as proofs of zeal on the part of the publishers to present to their readers a series of productions, which, as they are connected, not with ephemeral, but with permanent subjects, may, years hence as well as now, be consulted for lively amusement as well as solid instruction. \\n\\n \\n\\n To render this Library still more worthy of patronage, the proprietors propose incorporating in it such works of interest and value as may appear in the various Libraries and Miscellanies now preparing in Europe, particularly “Constable’s Miscellany,” the “Edinburgh Cabinet” Library, \u0026c. All these productions, as they emanate from the press, will be submitted to literary gentlemen for inspection; and none will be reprinted but such as shall be found calculated to sustain the exalted character which this Library has already acquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n Several well-known authors have been engaged to prepare for it original works of an American character, on History, Biography, Travels, \u0026c. \u0026c. \\n\\n \\n\\n Every distinct subject will in general be comprehended in one volume, or at most in three volumes, which may form either a portion of the series or a complete work by itself; and each volume will be embellished with appropriate engravings. \\n\\n \\n\\n The entire series will be the production of authors of eminence, who have acquired celebrity by their literary labours, and whose names, as they appear in succession, will afford the surest guarantee to the public for the satisfactory manner in which the subjects will be treated. \\n\\n \\n\\n Such is the plan by which it is intended to form an American Family Library, comprising all that is valuable in those branches of knowledge which most happily unite entertainment with instruction. The utmost care will be taken, not only to exclude whatever can have an injurious influence on the mind, but to embrace every thing calculated to strengthen the best and most salutary impressions. \\n\\n \\n\\n With these arrangements and facilities, the publishers flatter themselves that they shall be able to present to their fellow-citizens a work of unparalleled merit and cheapness, embracing subjects adapted to all classes of readers, and forming a body of literature deserving the praise of having instructed many, and amused all; and above every other species of eulogy, of being fit to be introduced, without reserve or exception, by the father of a family to the domestic circle. Meanwhile, the very low price at which it is charged renders more extensive patronage necessary for its support and prosecution. The immediate encouragement, therefore, of those who approve its plan and execution is respectfully solicited. The work may be obtained in complete sets, or in separate numbers, from the principal booksellers throughout the United States. \\n\\n OPINIONS OF THE FAMILY LIBRARY. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The publishers have hitherto fully deserved their daily increasing reputation by the good taste and judgment which have influenced the selections of works for the Family Library.”—Albany Daily Advertiser. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The Family Library—A title which, from the valuable and entertaining matter the collection contains, as well as from the careful style of its execution, it well deserves. No family, indeed, in which there are children to be brought up, ought to be without this Library, as it furnishes the readiest resources for that education which ought to accompany or succeed that of the boarding-school or the academy, and is infinitely more conducive than either to the cultivation of the intellect.”—Monthly Review. \\n\\n \\n\\n “It is the duty of every person having a family to put this excellent Library into the hands of his children.”—N. Y. Mercantile Advertiser. \\n\\n \\n\\n “It is one of the recommendations of the Family Library, that it embraces a large circle of interesting matter, of important information and agreeable entertainment, in a concise manner and a cheap form. It is eminently calculated for a popular series—published at a price so low, that persons of the most moderate income may purchase it—combining a matter and a style that the most ordinary mind may comprehend it, at the same time that it is calculated to raise the moral and intellectual character of the people.”—Constellation. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We have repeatedly borne testimony to the utility of this work. It is one of the best that has ever been issued from the American press, and should be in the library of every family desirous of treasuring up useful knowledge.”—Boston Statesman. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We venture the assertion that there is no publication in the country more suitably adapted to the taste and requirements of the great mass of community, or better calculated to raise the intellectual character of the middling classes of society, than the Family Library.”—Boston Masonic Mirror. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We have so often recommended this enterprising and useful publication (the Family Library), that we can here only add, that each successive number appears to confirm its merited popularity.”—N. Y. American. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The little volumes of this series truly comport with their title, and are in themselves a Family Library.”—N. Y. Commercial Advertiser. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We recommend the whole set of the Family Library as one of the cheapest means of affording pleasing instruction, and imparting a proper pride in books, with which we are acquainted.”—U. S. Gazette. \\n\\n \\n\\n “It will prove instructing and amusing to all classes. We are pleased to learn that the works comprising this Library have become, as they ought to be, quite popular among the heads of families.”—N. Y. Gazette. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The Family Library is, what its name implies, a collection of various original works of the best kind, containing reading useful and interesting to the family circle. It is neatly printed, and should be in every family that can afford it—the price being moderate.”—New-England Palladium. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We are pleased to see that the publishers have obtained sufficient encouragement to continue their valuable Family Library.”—Baltimore Republican. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The Family Library presents, in a compendious and convenient form, well-written histories of popular men, kingdoms, sciences, \u0026c. arranged and edited by able writers, and drawn entirely from the most correct and accredited authorities. It is, as it professes to be, a Family Library, from which, at little expense, a household may prepare themselves for a consideration of those elementary subjects of education and society, without a due acquaintance with which neither man nor woman has claim to be well bred, or to take their proper place among those with whom they abide.”—Charleston Gazette. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1661/48992.html","bookId":1199,"book":{"id":1199,"title":"The Life of Sir Isaac Newton","description":"简介： Books that you may carry to the fire, and hold readily in your hand, are the most useful after all.
