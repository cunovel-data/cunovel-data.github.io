{"id":3777,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"The Opening of the Eyes of Mrs Chick Miss Tox, all unconscious of any such rare appearances in connexion with Mr Dombey\u0027s house, as scaffoldings and ladders, and men with their heads tied up in pocket-handkerchiefs, glaring in at the windows like flying genii or strange birds, - having breakfasted one morning at about this eventful period of time, on her customary viands; to wit, one French roll rasped, one egg new laid (or warranted to be), and one little pot of tea, wherein was infused one little silver scoopful of that herb on behalf of Miss Tox, and one little silver scoopful on behalf of the teapot - a flight of fancy in which good housekeepers delight; went upstairs to set forth the bird waltz on the harpsichord, to water and arrange the plants, to dust the nick-nacks, and, according to her daily custom, to make her little drawing-room the garland of Princess\u0027s Place. Miss Tox endued herself with a pair of ancient gloves, like dead leaves, in which she was accustomed to perform these avocations - hidden from human sight at other times in a table drawer - and went methodically to work; beginning with the bird waltz; passing, by a natural association of ideas, to her bird - a very high-shouldered canary, stricken in years, and much rumpled, but a piercing singer, as Princess\u0027s Place well knew; taking, next in order, the little china ornaments, paper fly-cages, and so forth; and coming round, in good time, to the plants, which generally required to be snipped here and there with a pair of scissors, for some botanical reason that was very powerful with Miss Tox. Miss Tox was slow in coming to the plants, this morning. The weather was warm, the wind southerly; and there was a sigh of the summer-time In Princess\u0027s Place, that turned Miss Tox\u0027s thoughts upon the country. The pot-boy attached to the Princess\u0027s Arms had come out with a can and trickled water, in a flowering pattern, all over Princess\u0027s Place, and it gave the weedy ground a fresh scent - quite a growing scent, Miss Tox said. There was a tiny blink of sun peeping in from the great street round the corner, and the smoky sparrows hopped over it and back again, brightening as they passed: or bathed in it, like a stream, and became glorified sparrows, unconnected with chimneys. Legends in praise of Ginger-Beer, with pictorial representations of thirsty customers submerged in the effervescence, or stunned by the flying corks, were conspicuous in the window of the Princess\u0027s Arms. They were making late hay, somewhere out of town; and though the fragrance had a long way to come, and many counter fragrances to contend with among the dwellings of the poor (may God reward the worthy gentlemen who stickle for the Plague as part and parcel of the wisdom of our ancestors, and who do their little best to keep those dwellings miserable!), yet it was wafted faintly into Princess\u0027s Place, whispering of Nature and her wholesome air, as such things will, even unto prisoners and captives, and those who are desolate and oppressed, in very spite of aldermen and knights to boot: at whose sage nod - and how they nod! - the rolling world stands still! Miss Tox sat down upon the window-seat, and thought of her good Papa deceased - Mr Tox, of the Customs Department of the public service; and of her childhood, passed at a seaport, among a considerable quantity of cold tar, and some rusticity. She fell into a softened remembrance of meadows, in old time, gleaming with buttercups, like so many inverted firmaments of golden stars; and how she had made chains of dandelion-stalks for youthful vowers of eternal constancy, dressed chiefly in nankeen; and how soon those fetters had withered and broken. Sitting on the window-seat, and looking out upon the sparrows and the blink of sun, Miss Tox thought likewise of her good Mama deceased - sister to the owner of the powdered head and pigtail - of her virtues and her rheumatism. And when a man with bulgy legs, and a rough voice, and a heavy basket on his head that crushed his hat into a mere black muffin, came crying flowers down Princess\u0027s Place, making his timid little roots of daisies shudder in the vibration of every yell he gave, as though he had been an ogre, hawking little children, summer recollections were so strong upon Miss Tox, that she shook her head, and murmured she would be comparatively old before she knew it - which seemed likely. In her pensive mood, Miss Tox\u0027s thoughts went wandering on Mr Dombey\u0027s track; probably because the Major had returned home to his lodgings opposite, and had just bowed to her from his window. What other reason could Miss Tox have for connecting Mr Dombey with her summer days and dandelion fetters? Was he more cheerful? thought Miss Tox. Was he reconciled to the decrees of fate? Would he ever marry again? and if yes, whom? What sort of person now! A flush - it was warm weather - overspread Miss Tox\u0027s face, as, while entertaining these meditations, she turned her head, and was surprised by the reflection of her thoughtful image In the chimney-glass. Another flush succeeded when she saw a little carriage drive into Princess\u0027s Place, and make straight for her own door. Miss Tox arose, took up her scissors hastily, and so coming, at last, to the plants, was very busy with them when Mrs Chick entered the room. \u0027How is my sweetest friend!\u0027 exclaimed Miss Tox, with open arms. A little stateliness was mingled with Miss Tox\u0027s sweetest friend\u0027s demeanour, but she kissed Miss Tox, and said, \u0027Lucretia, thank you, I am pretty well. I hope you are the same. Hem!\u0027 Mrs Chick was labouring under a peculiar little monosyllabic cough; a sort of primer, or easy introduction to the art of coughing. \u0027You call very early, and how kind that is, my dear!\u0027 pursued Miss Tox. \u0027Now, have you breakfasted?\u0027 \u0027Thank you, Lucretia,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, \u0027I have. I took an early breakfast\u0027 - the good lady seemed curious on the subject of Princess\u0027s Place, and looked all round it as she spoke - \u0027with my brother, who has come home.\u0027 \u0027He is better, I trust, my love,\u0027 faltered Miss Tox. \u0027He is greatly better, thank you. Hem!\u0027 \u0027My dear Louisa must be careful of that cough\u0027 remarked Miss Tox. \u0027It\u0027s nothing,\u0027 returned Mrs Chic \u0027It\u0027s merely change of weather. We must expect change.\u0027 \u0027Of weather?\u0027 asked Miss Tox, in her simplicity. \u0027Of everything\u0027 returned Mrs Chick \u0027Of course we must. It\u0027s a world of change. Anyone would surprise me very much, Lucretia, and would greatly alter my opinion of their understanding, if they attempted to contradict or evade what is so perfectly evident. Change!\u0027 exclaimed Mrs Chick, with severe philosophy. \u0027Why, my gracious me, what is there that does not change! even the silkworm, who I am sure might be supposed not to trouble itself about such subjects, changes into all sorts of unexpected things continually.\u0027 \u0027My Louisa,\u0027 said the mild Miss Tox, \u0027is ever happy in her illustrations.\u0027 \u0027You are so kind, Lucretia,\u0027 returned Mrs Chick, a little softened, \u0027as to say so, and to think so, I believe. I hope neither of us may ever have any cause to lessen our opinion of the other, Lucretia.\u0027 \u0027I am sure of it,\u0027 returned Miss Tox. Mrs Chick coughed as before, and drew lines on the carpet with the ivory end of her parasol. Miss Tox, who had experience of her fair friend, and knew that under the pressure of any slight fatigue or vexation she was prone to a discursive kind of irritability, availed herself of the pause, to change the subject. \u0027Pardon me, my dear Louisa,\u0027 said Miss Tox, \u0027but have I caught sight of the manly form of Mr Chick in the carriage?\u0027 \u0027He is there,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, \u0027but pray leave him there. He has his newspaper, and would be quite contented for the next two hours. Go on with your flowers, Lucretia, and allow me to sit here and rest.\u0027 \u0027My Louisa knows,\u0027 observed Miss Tox, \u0027that between friends like ourselves, any approach to ceremony would be out of the question. Therefore - \u0027 Therefore Miss Tox finished the sentence, not in words but action; and putting on her gloves again, which she had taken off, and arming herself once more with her scissors, began to snip and clip among the leaves with microscopic industry. \u0027Florence has returned home also,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, after sitting silent for some time, with her head on one side, and her parasol sketching on the floor; \u0027and really Florence is a great deal too old now, to continue to lead that solitary life to which she has been accustomed. Of course she is. There can be no doubt about it. I should have very little respect, indeed, for anybody who could advocate a different opinion. Whatever my wishes might be, I could not respect them. We cannot command our feelings to such an extent as that.\u0027 Miss Tox assented, without being particular as to the intelligibility of the proposition. \u0027If she\u0027s a strange girl,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, \u0027and if my brother Paul cannot feel perfectly comfortable in her society, after all the sad things that have happened, and all the terrible disappointments that have been undergone, then, what is the reply? That he must make an effort. That he is bound to make an effort. We have always been a family remarkable for effort. Paul is at the head of the family; almost the only representative of it left - for what am I - I am of no consequence - \u0027 \u0027My dearest love,\u0027 remonstrated Miss Tox. Mrs Chick dried her eyes, which were, for the moment, overflowing; and proceeded: \u0027And consequently he is more than ever bound to make an effort. And though his having done so, comes upon me with a sort of shock - for mine is a very weak and foolish nature; which is anything but a blessing I am sure; I often wish my heart was a marble slab, or a paving-stone - \u0027My sweet Louisa,\u0027 remonstrated Miss Tox again. \u0027Still, it is a triumph to me to know that he is so true to himself, and to his name of Dombey; although, of course, I always knew he would be. I only hope,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, after a pause, \u0027that she may be worthy of the name too. Miss Tox filled a little green watering-pot from a jug, and happening to look up when she had done so, was so surprised by the amount of expression Mrs Chick had conveyed into her face, and was bestowing upon her, that she put the little watering-pot on the table for the present, and sat down near it. \u0027My dear Louisa,\u0027 said Miss Tox, \u0027will it be the least satisfaction to you, if I venture to observe in reference to that remark, that I, as a humble individual, think your sweet niece in every way most promising?~ \u0027What do you mean, Lucretia?\u0027 returned Mrs Chick, with increased stateliness of manner. \u0027To what remark of mine, my dear, do you refer?\u0027 \u0027Her being worthy of her name, my love,\u0027 replied Miss Tox. \u0027If,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, with solemn patience, \u0027I have not expressed myself with clearness, Lucretia, the fault of course is mine. There is, perhaps, no reason why I should express myself at all, except the intimacy that has subsisted between us, and which I very much hope, Lucretia - confidently hope - nothing will occur to disturb. Because, why should I do anything else? There is no reason; it would be absurd. But I wish to express myself clearly, Lucretia; and therefore to go back to that remark, I must beg to say that it was not intended to relate to Florence, in any way.\u0027 \u0027Indeed!\u0027 returned Miss Tox. \u0027No,\u0027 said Mrs Chick shortly and decisively. \u0027Pardon me, my dear,\u0027 rejoined her meek friend; \u0027but I cannot have understood it. I fear I am dull.\u0027 Mrs Chick looked round the room and over the way; at the plants, at the bird, at the watering-pot, at almost everything within view, except Miss Tox; and finally dropping her glance upon Miss Tox, for a moment, on its way to the ground, said, looking meanwhile with elevated eyebrows at the carpet: \u0027When I speak, Lucretia, of her being worthy of the name, I speak of my brother Paul\u0027s second wife. I believe I have already said, in effect, if not in the very words I now use, that it is his intention to marry a second wife.\u0027 Miss Tox left her seat in a hurry, and returned to her plants; clipping among the stems and leaves, with as little favour as a barber working at so many pauper heads of hair. \u0027Whether she will be fully sensible of the distinction conferred upon her,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, in a lofty tone, \u0027is quite another question. I hope she may be. We are bound to think well of one another in this world, and I hope she may be. I have not been advised with myself If I had been advised with, I have no doubt my advice would have been cavalierly received, and therefore it is infinitely better as it is. I much prefer it as it is.\u0027 Miss Tox, with head bent down, still clipped among the plants. Mrs Chick, with energetic shakings of her own head from time to time, continued to hold forth, as if in defiance of somebody. \u0027If my brother Paul had consulted with me, which he sometimes does - or rather, sometimes used to do; for he will naturally do that no more now, and this is a circumstance which I regard as a relief from responsibility,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, hysterically, \u0027for I thank Heaven I am not jealous - \u0027 here Mrs Chick again shed tears: \u0027if my brother Paul had come to me, and had said, \"Louisa, what kind of qualities would you advise me to look out for, in a wife?\" I should certainly have answered, \"Paul, you must have family, you must have beauty, you must have dignity, you must have connexion.\" Those are the words I should have used. You might have led me to the block immediately afterwards,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, as if that consequence were highly probable, \u0027but I should have used them. I should have said, \"Paul! You to marry a second time without family! You to marry without beauty! You to marry without dignity! You to marry without connexion! There is nobody in the world, not mad, who could dream of daring to entertain such a preposterous idea!\"\u0027 Miss Tox stopped clipping; and with her head among the plants, listened attentively. Perhaps Miss Tox thought there was hope in this exordium, and the warmth of Mrs Chick. I should have adopted this course of argument,\u0027 pursued the discreet lady, \u0027because I trust I am not a fool. I make no claim to be considered a person of superior intellect - though I believe some people have been extraordinary enough to consider me so; one so little humoured as I am, would very soon be disabused of any such notion; but I trust I am not a downright fool. And to tell ME,\u0027 said Mrs Chick with ineffable disdain, \u0027that my brother Paul Dombey could ever contemplate the possibility of uniting himself to anybody - I don\u0027t care who\u0027 - she was more sharp and emphatic in that short clause than in any other part of her discourse - \u0027not possessing these requisites, would be to insult what understanding I have got, as much as if I was to be told that I was born and bred an elephant, which I may be told next,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, with resignation. \u0027It wouldn\u0027t surprise me at all. I expect it.\u0027 In the moment\u0027s silence that ensued, Miss Tox\u0027s scissors gave a feeble clip or two; but Miss Tox\u0027s face was still invisible, and Miss Tox\u0027s morning gown was agitated. Mrs Chick looked sideways at her, through the intervening plants, and went on to say, in a tone of bland conviction, and as one dwelling on a point of fact that hardly required to be stated: \u0027Therefore, of course my brother Paul has done what was to be expected of him, and what anybody might have foreseen he would do, if he entered the marriage state again. I confess it takes me rather by surprise, however gratifying; because when Paul went out of town I had no idea at all that he would form any attachment out of town, and he certainly had no attachment when he left here. However, it seems to be extremely desirable in every point of view. I have no doubt the mother is a most genteel and elegant creature, and I have no right whatever to dispute the policy of her living with them: which is Paul\u0027s affair, not mine - and as to Paul\u0027s choice, herself, I have only seen her picture yet, but that is beautiful indeed. Her name is beautiful too,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, shaking her head with energy, and arranging herself in her chair; \u0027Edith is at once uncommon, as it strikes me, and distinguished. Consequently, Lucretia, I have no doubt you will be happy to hear that the marriage is to take place immediately - of course, you will:\u0027 great emphasis again: \u0027and that you are delighted with this change in the condition of my brother, who has shown you a great deal of pleasant attention at various times.\u0027 Miss Tox made no verbal answer, but took up the little watering-pot with a trembling hand, and looked vacantly round as if considering what article of furniture would be improved by the contents. The room door opening at this crisis of Miss Tox\u0027s feelings, she started, laughed aloud, and fell into the arms of the person entering; happily insensible alike of Mrs Chick\u0027s indignant countenance and of the Major at his window over the way, who had his double-barrelled eye-glass in full action, and whose face and figure were dilated with Mephistophelean joy. Not so the expatriated Native, amazed supporter of Miss Tox\u0027s swooning form, who, coming straight upstairs, with a polite inquiry touching Miss Tox\u0027s health (in exact pursuance of the Major\u0027s malicious instructions), had accidentally arrived in the very nick of time to catch the delicate burden in his arms, and to receive the content\u0027 of the little watering-pot in his shoe; both of which circumstances, coupled with his consciousness of being closely watched by the wrathful Major, who had threatened the usual penalty in regard of every bone in his skin in case of any failure, combined to render him a moving spectacle of mental and bodily distress. For some moments, this afflicted foreigner remained clasping Miss Tox to his heart, with an energy of action in remarkable opposition to his disconcerted face, while that poor lady trickled slowly down upon him the very last sprinklings of the little watering-pot, as if he were a delicate exotic (which indeed he was), and might be almost expected to blow while the gentle rain descended. Mrs Chick, at length recovering sufficient presence of mind to interpose, commanded him to drop Miss Tox upon the sofa and withdraw; and the exile promptly obeying, she applied herself to promote Miss Tox\u0027s recovery. But none of that gentle concern which usually characterises the daughters of Eve in their tending of each other; none of that freemasonry in fainting, by which they are generally bound together In a mysterious bond of sisterhood; was visible in Mrs Chick\u0027s demeanour. Rather like the executioner who restores the victim to sensation previous to proceeding with the torture (or was wont to do so, in the good old times for which all true men wear perpetual mourning), did Mrs Chick administer the smelling-bottle, the slapping on the hands, the dashing of cold water on the face, and the other proved remedies. And when, at length, Miss Tox opened her eyes, and gradually became restored to animation and consciousness, Mrs Chick drew off as from a criminal, and reversing the precedent of the murdered king of Denmark, regarded her more in anger than In sorrow.\u0027 \u0027Lucretia!\u0027 said Mrs Chick \u0027I will not attempt to disguise what I feel. My eyes are opened, all at once. I wouldn\u0027t have believed this, if a Saint had told it to me. \u0027I am foolish to give way to faintness,\u0027 Miss Tox faltered. \u0027I shall be better presently.\u0027 \u0027You will be better presently, Lucretia!\u0027 repeated Mrs Chick, with exceeding scorn. \u0027Do you suppose I am blind? Do you imagine I am in my second childhood? No, Lucretia! I am obliged to you!\u0027 Miss Tox directed an imploring, helpless kind of look towards her friend, and put her handkerchief before her face. \u0027If anyone had told me this yesterday,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, with majesty, \u0027or even half-an-hour ago, I should have been tempted, I almost believe, to strike them to the earth. Lucretia Tox, my eyes are opened to you all at once. The scales:\u0027 here Mrs Chick cast down an imaginary pair, such as are commonly used in grocers\u0027 shops: \u0027have fallen from my sight. The blindness of my confidence is past, Lucretia. It has been abused and played, upon, and evasion is quite out of the question now, I assure you. \u0027Oh! to what do you allude so cruelly, my love?\u0027 asked Miss Tox, through her tears. \u0027Lucretia,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, \u0027ask your own heart. I must entreat you not to address me by any such familiar term as you have just used, if you please. I have some self-respect left, though you may think otherwise.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Louisa!\u0027 cried Miss Tox. \u0027How can you speak to me like that?\u0027 \u0027How can I speak to you like that?\u0027 retorted Mrs Chick, who, in default of having any particular argument to sustain herself upon, relied principally on such repetitions for her most withering effects. \u0027Like that! You may well say like that, indeed!\u0027 Miss Tox sobbed pitifully. \u0027The idea!\u0027 said Mrs Chick, \u0027of your having basked at my brother\u0027s fireside, like a serpent, and wound yourself, through me, almost into his confidence, Lucretia, that you might, in secret, entertain designs upon him, and dare to aspire to contemplate the possibility of his uniting himself to you! Why, it is an idea,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, with sarcastic dignity, \u0027the absurdity of which almost relieves its treachery.\u0027 \u0027Pray, Louisa,\u0027 urged Miss Tox, \u0027do not say such dreadful things.\u0027 \u0027Dreadful things!\u0027 repeated Mrs Chick. \u0027Dreadful things! Is it not a fact, Lucretia, that you have just now been unable to command your feelings even before me, whose eyes you had so completely closed?\u0027 \u0027I have made no complaint,\u0027 sobbed Miss Tox. \u0027I have said nothing. If I have been a little overpowered by your news, Louisa, and have ever had any lingering thought that Mr Dombey was inclined to be particular towards me, surely you will not condemn me.\u0027 \u0027She is going to say,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, addressing herself to the whole of the furniture, in a comprehensive glance of resignation and appeal, \u0027She is going to say - I know it - that I have encouraged her!\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t wish to exchange reproaches, dear Louisa,\u0027 sobbed Miss Tox \u0027Nor do I wish to complain. But, in my own defence - \u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 cried Mrs Chick, looking round the room with a prophetic smile, \u0027that\u0027s what she\u0027s going to say. I knew it. You had better say it. Say it openly! Be open, Lucretia Tox,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, with desperate sternness, \u0027whatever you are.\u0027 \u0027In my own defence,\u0027 faltered Miss Tox, \u0027and only In my own defence against your unkind words, my dear Louisa, I would merely ask you if you haven\u0027t often favoured such a fancy, and even said it might happen, for anything we could tell?\u0027 \u0027There is a point,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, rising, not as if she were going to stop at the floor, but as if she were about to soar up, high, into her native skies, \u0027beyond which endurance becomes ridiculous, if not culpable. I can bear much; but not too much. What spell was on me when I came into this house this day, I don\u0027t know; but I had a presentiment - a dark presentiment,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, with a shiver, \u0027that something was going to happen. Well may I have had that foreboding, Lucretia, when my confidence of many years is destroyed in an instant, when my eyes are opened all at once, and when I find you revealed in your true colours. Lucretia, I have been mistaken in you. It is better for us both that this subject should end here. I wish you well, and I shall ever wish you well. But, as an individual who desires to be true to herself in her own poor position, whatever that position may be, or may not be - and as the sister of my brother - and as the sister-in-law of my brother\u0027s wife - and as a connexion by marriage of my brother\u0027s wife\u0027s mother - may I be permitted to add, as a Dombey? - I can wish you nothing else but good morning.\u0027 These words, delivered with cutting suavity, tempered and chastened by a lofty air of moral rectitude, carried the speaker to the door. There she inclined her head in a ghostly and statue-like manner, and so withdrew to her carriage, to seek comfort and consolation in the arms of Mr Chick, her lord. Figuratively speaking, that is to say; for the arms of Mr Chick were full of his newspaper. Neither did that gentleman address his eyes towards his wife otherwise than by stealth. Neither did he offer any consolation whatever. In short, he sat reading, and humming fag ends of tunes, and sometimes glancing furtively at her without delivering himself of a word, good, bad, or indifferent. In the meantime Mrs Chick sat swelling and bridling, and tossing her head, as if she were still repeating that solemn formula of farewell to Lucretia Tox. At length, she said aloud, \u0027Oh the extent to which her eyes had been opened that day!\u0027 \u0027To which your eyes have been opened, my dear!\u0027 repeated Mr Chick. \u0027Oh, don\u0027t talk to me!\u0027 said Mrs Chic \u0027if you can bear to see me in this state, and not ask me what the matter is, you had better hold your tongue for ever.\u0027 \u0027What is the matter, my dear?\u0027 asked Mr Chick \u0027To think,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, in a state of soliloquy, \u0027that she should ever have conceived the base idea of connecting herself with our family by a marriage with Paul! To think that when she was playing at horses with that dear child who is now in his grave - I never liked it at the time - she should have been hiding such a double-faced design! I wonder she was never afraid that something would happen to her. She is fortunate if nothing does.\u0027 \u0027I really thought, my dear,\u0027 said Mr Chick slowly, after rubbing the bridge of his nose for some time with his newspaper, \u0027that you had gone on the same tack yourself, all along, until this morning; and had thought it would be a convenient thing enough, if it could have been brought about.\u0027 Mrs Chick instantly burst into tears, and told Mr Chick that if he wished to trample upon her with his boots, he had better do It. \u0027But with Lucretia Tox I have done,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, after abandoning herself to her feelings for some minutes, to Mr Chick\u0027s great terror. \u0027I can bear to resign Paul\u0027s confidence in favour of one who, I hope and trust, may be deserving of it, and with whom he has a perfect right to replace poor Fanny if he chooses; I can bear to be informed, In Paul\u0027s cool manner, of such a change in his plans, and never to be consulted until all is settled and determined; but deceit I can not bear, and with Lucretia Tox I have done. It is better as it is,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, piously; \u0027much better. It would have been a long time before I could have accommodated myself comfortably with her, after this; and I really don\u0027t know, as Paul is going to be very grand, and these are people of condition, that she would have been quite presentable, and might not have compromised myself. There\u0027s a providence in everything; everything works for the best; I have been tried today but on the whole I do not regret it.\u0027 In which Christian spirit, Mrs Chick dried her eyes and smoothed her lap, and sat as became a person calm under a great wrong. Mr Chick feeling his unworthiness no doubt, took an early opportunity of being set down at a street corner and walking away whistling, with his shoulders very much raised, and his hands in his pockets. While poor excommunicated Miss Tox, who, if she were a fawner and toad-eater, was at least an honest and a constant one, and had ever borne a faithful friendship towards her impeacher and had been truly absorbed and swallowed up in devotion to the magnificence of Mr Dombey - while poor excommunicated Miss Tox watered her plants with her tears, and felt that it was winter in Princess\u0027s Place. 跟董贝先生公馆有关的这些以往罕见的现象——脚手架啦，梯子啦，还有那些头上扎着手绢、像会飞的鸟儿一样，在窗口瞪着眼睛往里看的工人啦，——托克斯小姐丝毫也不知道。在这一段多事的时期中的一个早晨，她按照平常的食谱吃完了早餐，也就是说，吃了一个咬起来喀嚓喀嚓发响的花卷蛋糕，一个新鲜的（或卖蛋人保证是新鲜的）鸡蛋和喝了一小壶茶（在这个小壶里，分量为一银勺的茶叶是为托克斯小姐沏的；另一银勺是为这个茶壶沏的；这是善良的主妇们所喜爱的一种奇思妙想）；然后托克斯小姐上楼去，准备把“鸟儿圆舞曲”曲谱摆在大键琴上，给花浇浇水和整整枝叶，给小摆设抹抹灰尘，并按照她平日的习惯，把她的小客厅布置成为公主广场的一个花环。 托克斯小姐戴上一双枯叶色的旧式手套（她习惯在干这些活的时候戴上它，在其他时候则把它藏在桌子抽屉里，不让别人看见），有条不紊地动手工作；开始是把“鸟儿圆舞曲”曲谱摆好；由于自然的联想，她接着跑去照料她的鸟儿——这是一只胸口很窄的金丝雀，它已经老了，羽毛十分蓬乱，但却是一个声音尖锐的歌唱家，在公主广场是很有名的——；按照次序，下面轮到瓷做的装饰品，纸做的捕蝇笼，等等。然后她按时地转到花卉上，根据托克斯小姐十分信服的生物学的理由，需要用剪刀把它们这里那里剪去一些。 这天早晨，托克斯小姐是不慌不忙地前去照料花卉的。气候温暖，南风吹拂，公主广场上荡漾着夏天的气息，这使托克斯小姐的思想转到了乡间。“公主纹章”酒馆的服务员拿着一个喷壶出来洒水，在公主广场上布满了流动的图案；经他这样喷洒之后，长着野草的土地散发出了新鲜的香气——托克斯小姐说，这完全是野草生长的香气。从大街拐角偷偷地透进一点阳光，那些被烟熏黑的麻雀跳过它，又跳回来，在阳光下闪闪发亮；要不然它们就像沐浴在溪流中一样，沐浴在阳光中，成了光彩夺目的麻雀，好像从没和烟囱为邻似的。 “公主纹章”酒馆的橱窗中显眼地陈列着赞扬姜汁啤酒的广告，广告中画着口渴的顾客正被翻滚着的泡沫淹没或被飞出的瓶塞打得不省人事。城外的什么地方，人们正在翻晒晚割的干草，虽然香气要经过远远的距离才能传过来，而且还得跟穷人茅屋中间散发出的迥然不同的气味相竞争（有些值得尊敬的大人先生们认为瘟疫是我们祖先智慧不可缺少的部分，并竭尽他们微薄的力量来把这些肮脏破烂的茅屋保存下来；愿上帝奖赏这些大人先生们吧！），然而这些香气还是微弱地飘送到了公主广场，低声诉说着大自然和它有益于健康的空气，而且无视市参议员和骑士先生们的反对，（他们贤明地点一点头，这转动的世界也就会停止不动；而他们是怎样点头的啊！），甚至把这些喁喁私语也传送到了囚犯、俘虏以及那些孤独无依和遭受压迫的人们那里（这样的事情总是会发生的）。 托克斯小姐在窗下坐下，想到了她死去的好爸爸——在海关署当公务员的托克斯先生；想到了她在一个海港度过的童年，那海港带有几分乡村风味，附近有大量的冷焦油；她沉湎在往昔岁月中那些草地的甜蜜的回忆之中；那些闪烁着毛茛的草地，真好像布满金色的星星的苍穹上下颠倒过来似的；她记得她曾经怎样用蒲公英的梗子为那些海誓山盟、主要穿着土布的年轻情侣们编织脚镣，这些脚镣不久又怎样枯萎和破碎了。 托克斯小姐坐在窗下，眼望着麻雀和闪烁的阳光，又想到了她死去的，妈妈——那位头上敷粉和梳了一根辫子的人的姐姐——，想到了她的善行美德和她的风湿病。有一个两腿粗壮、声音刺耳的男子跑到公主广场来卖花；他头上沉重的篮子把他的帽子压得像一块黑色的松饼一样；他每么喝一声，胆怯的雏菊就颤抖一下，仿佛他是个叫卖小孩的吃人魔鬼似的；这时托克斯小姐夏日的回忆强烈地涌上心头，她摇摇头，咕哝着说，她将在她没有觉察之前就变老了——这似乎是很可能的。 托克斯小姐在沉思状态中开始想到了董贝先生，也许是因为少校已经回到了对面的住所，刚才还从他的窗口向她鞠躬致意的缘故。要不然，还有什么别的原因能使托克斯小姐把董贝先生跟她关于夏天与蒲公英编织的脚镣的回忆联系起来呢？他是不是快活一些了？托克斯小姐想。他是不是安于命运的摆布？他是不是将会再婚呢？如果是的话，跟谁结婚呢？她是个什么样的人呢！ 托克斯小姐的脸上泛起一阵红晕——天气是温暖的——，因为当她正沉陷在这些思想中的时候，她回过头去，惊奇地看到了烟囱上镜子里正反照出她自己在沉思的形象。当她看到一辆小马车驶进公主广场，直奔她的家门时，脸上又涌上另一阵红晕。托克斯小姐站起身来，急忙拿起剪刀，最后走到花旁；当奇克夫人走进房间的时候，她正十分忙碌地剪着。 “我最亲爱的朋友，您好吗？”托克斯小姐张开胳膊，高声喊道。 托克斯小姐的最亲爱的朋友的态度中有几分庄严，但她吻了托克斯小姐，说道，“卢克丽霞，谢谢您，我很好。我希望您也一样。嗯赫！” 奇克夫人奇特地一声一声不连贯的咳嗽，这是连声咳嗽的导火线或前奏曲。 “您对我真好，这么早就来看我，我亲爱的！”托克斯小姐继续说道，“您吃过早饭了吗？” “谢谢您，卢克丽霞，”奇克夫人说道，“我吃过了。今天早饭吃得很早——”这位善良的夫人似乎对公主广场感到好奇，一边说一边环顾着四周，“是跟我哥哥一道吃的，他已经回家了。” “我想他比过去好些了吧，我亲爱的，”托克斯小姐结结巴巴地说道。 “他好得多了，谢谢您，嗯赫！” “亲爱的路易莎，你得注意您的咳嗽，”托克斯小姐说道。 “没什么，”奇克夫人回答道，“只不过是因为气候变化的缘故。我们必须预料到会有变化。” “是指气候变化吗？”托克斯小姐以她特有的纯朴的表情问道。 “任何事情的变化，”奇克夫人回答道，“我们当然必须预料到。这是个充满变化的世界。任何人如果企图对抗或回避那些显而易见的真理，都会使我大吃一惊的，卢克丽霞，并会大大改变我对她（他）是否通晓事理的看法的。变化！”奇克夫人带着严肃的哲学意味，高声喊道，“哎呀，天哪，还有什么不发生变化的！即使是蚕，我本以为它不会在这方面给自己找麻烦的，可是它却连续不断地变成各种意想不到的东西。” “我的路易莎，”温柔的托克斯小姐说道，“总是举出巧妙的例子来说明。” “卢克丽霞，”稍稍温和下来的奇克夫人回答道，“我相信，您这么说和这么想是您的一片好意。我希望，我们两人谁也不会有什么理由来改变彼此的看法。” “我完全相信，”托克斯小姐回答道。 奇克夫人像先前一样咳嗽，并用她的阳伞的象牙顶在地毯上画着线条。托克斯小姐熟悉她这位女朋友的脾气，知道她稍有一点疲劳或烦恼，就容易急躁地东拉西扯，所以趁着停息的时间，改变了话题。 “请原谅我，我亲爱的路易莎，”托克斯小姐说，“不过我好像在马车里看到了奇克先生雄伟的身姿了？” “他是在那里，”奇克夫人说道，“不过让他待在那里吧。他有报纸，他将会十分甘心乐意地在那里消磨掉两小时。继续弄你的花吧，卢克丽霞，请允许我坐在这里休息一下。”“我的路易莎知道，”托克斯小姐说道，“在我们这样的朋友之间，根本不必讲什么礼节。因此——”因此托克斯小姐就用行动，而不是用言语来结束她的这句话；她又戴上原先脱下的手套，重新拿起剪刀，开始又细心又勤奋地修剪叶子。 “弗洛伦斯也回家了，”奇克夫人头歪向一边，用阳伞顶在地板上画着图画，这样默默坐了一会儿之后说道，“说实在的，弗洛伦斯现在年纪太大了，不能再让她过她过去习惯了的孤独的生活了。她当然是太大了。这是毫无疑问的。说真的，谁要是提出不同的看法的话，那么我们就不会再尊敬他们。不管我的愿望怎么样，我也不能再尊敬他们了。我们不能把我们的感情支配到那样的地步。” 托克斯小姐虽然并不十分理解这些话的含意，但她表示同意。 “如果她是个奇怪的女孩子，”奇克夫人说道，“如果我的哥哥保罗在经历了所有那些悲伤的事情、遭受了所有那些可怕的挫折之后，觉得跟她在一起不很自在的话，那么该怎么回答这个问题呢？回答是：他必须作出努力，他应当作出努力。我们这个家族的一个显著的特点就是能作出努力。保罗是我们一家之首，几乎是我们这个家族留下的唯一代表—— 因为我算得了什么？——我是个无足轻重的人。” “我亲爱的，”托克斯小姐表示异议地说道。 奇克夫人抹干了一时间汪汪涌出的眼泪，继续说道： “所以，他比任何时候都应当作出努力。虽然他所作出的努力使我感到了一种震惊——因为我的性格是很软弱和很可笑的，这无论如何也不是一件值得高兴的事，我时常希望我的心是块大理石板，或是块铺路的石头——” “我亲爱的路易莎，”托克斯小姐又表示异议地说道。 “可是我还是十分高兴地知道他不愧为他本人，也不愧姓董贝这个姓；虽然，这是当然的，我过去也总知道，他将会这样的！我仅仅希望，”奇克夫人停了一下之后说道，“她也配姓那个姓。” 托克斯小姐从水罐中给一个绿色的小喷水壶中灌满了水，当她灌完之后抬起眼睛的时候，她十分吃惊地看到奇克夫人用那么意味深长的神色看着她的脸孔，因此她就把小喷水壶暂时放在桌子上，在桌旁坐下。 “我亲爱的路易莎，”托克斯小说道，“如果我听了您的那句话，冒昧地回答说，我这个卑贱的人认为您可爱的侄女在各方面都是个极有希望的孩子的话，那么也许你会很不高兴吧？” “您是什么意思，卢克丽霞？”奇克夫人用更加庄重的态度回答道，“您是指我的哪句话，我亲爱的？” “她配姓那个姓，我亲爱的，”托克斯小姐回答道。 “如果我没有把话说明白的话，”奇克夫人庄严而耐心地说道，“卢克丽霞，那么这自然是我的过错。要不是由于我们交情深厚，也许我根本就没有必要说明白，卢克丽霞，我非常希望——满怀信心地希望——，不会发生任何事情来破坏我们亲密的友谊。因为我怎么能不这样想呢？没有任何理由发生那样的事情。那是荒谬的。但是我希望把我的话说明白，卢克丽霞，因此我想回到我所说的那句话，我得说，我那句话绝对不是指弗洛伦斯。” “真的吗？”托克斯小姐回答道。 “是的，”奇克夫人简短而坚决地说道。 “请原谅我，我亲爱的，”她温顺的朋友回答道，“但是我听不明白。我担心我的脑子迟钝了。” 奇克夫人向房间四处看看，又看看广场对过；看看花，看看鸟，看看喷水壶，几乎看了在她视野之内的一切东西，只是没有看托克斯小姐；最后当她向地面低下眼睛时，她向托克斯小姐匆匆地看了一眼，然后看着地毯，但却又扬起眉毛，说道： “我说她要配姓那个姓，卢克丽霞，我是指我哥哥保罗的第二个妻子。虽然我没有使用现在的语言，但我想我已经表达了我的意思。他打算再婚。” 托克斯小姐急忙离开座位，回到花旁，像理发师给穷人理发那样毫不留情地剪着枝叶。 “她是不是将充分认识到给予她的光荣，”奇克夫人用高傲的声音说道，“这完全是另外一个问题。我希望她会认识到。在这个世界上我们应当彼此往好里去想，我希望她会认识到。这件事没有跟我商量过。如果跟我商量的话，那么他也不会把我的意见当一回事，所以像现在这样做反而无比地好得多。 我宁肯像现在这样。” 托克斯小姐低着头，依旧在剪枝叶，奇克夫人不时有力地摇摇头，继续说下去，仿佛在向什么人挑战似的。 “如果我的哥哥保罗跟我商量一下的话——他有时是跟我商量的，或者说得正确些，他过去有时是常爱跟我商量的；要知道，他现在自然不会再跟我商量了，我认为这倒使我解脱了责任，”奇克夫人歇斯底里地说道，“因为谢天谢地，我并不妒嫉——”这时奇克夫人又掉下了眼泪，“如果我的哥哥保罗前来对我说，‘路易莎，你给我出出主意，我找的妻子要具备什么条件？’我自然会回答：‘保罗，你必须找一个门第高贵的，你必须找一个容貌漂亮的，你必须找一个举止端庄的，你必须找一个亲戚体面的，’这些就是我要说的话。即使在这之后你立即把我带去上断头台，”奇克夫人说道，仿佛这一后果是很可能发生似的，“那么我还是要说这些话。如果我竟会对他说，‘保罗！你娶第二个妻子不要有高贵的门第！不要有漂亮的容貌！不要有端庄的举止！不要有体面的亲戚！’世界上的人只要不是发疯的，谁也不会梦想到敢有这样荒谬的想法！” 托克斯小姐停止剪枝叶，把头低向花丛，全神贯注地听着。也许托克斯小姐以为在这番开场白和奇克夫人的热情中存在着一些希望吧。 “我必须采取这种议论事理的程序，”这位考虑周到的夫人继续说道，“因为我相信，我不是个傻瓜。我并不奢望人们把我看成是智慧高超的人（虽然我相信，有人实在离奇，竟会这样看我，不过对于像我这样一个没有人会去巴结迎合的人，这类错误不久就会纠正过来的），可是我希望，我不是一个十足的傻瓜。要是有人对我说，”奇克夫人用难以形容的轻蔑的表情说道，“我的哥哥保罗·董贝可以考虑跟不具备这些不可缺少的条件的任何人成亲，——我不管是谁对我说的——”她说这短语的语气比她话语中的任何其他部分都更为尖锐和有力，“那就是侮辱我所具有的理智，那就等于告诉我，我生下来是只象，并像象一样地被养大；也许下一步就要对我这么说了，”奇克夫人露出逆来顺受的表情，说道，“这一点并不会使我吃惊。我等待着。” 在接着短暂的沉默中，托克斯小姐的剪刀有气无力地剪了一两下，但是托克斯小姐的脸却依旧看不到。托克斯小姐早晨穿的长外衣颤抖着。奇克夫人通过中间挡隔着的花斜看着她，然后像一个在详细谈论不需要解释的事实的人一样，用深信不疑的语气，继续说下去： “因此，我的哥哥保罗只要打算再婚，他自然做了人们预料他会做的事情，任何人都可以预见他会做的事情。我承认，这虽然使我高兴，但却使我相当吃惊，因为当保罗离开伦敦的时候，我根本没想到他会在伦敦以外的地方谈上恋爱；他离开这里的时候，当然是没有恋爱的。不过看来，无论从哪一方面看，这都是极为称心满意的。我毫无疑问，那母亲是一位极有教养、极为高尚的人，我也没有任何权利去争论，她跟他们住在一起是否合适，因为这是保罗的事，不是我的事。至于保罗挑中的人儿本人，我现在还只看到她的照片，不过从照片看，那可确实是个美人。她的名字也美，”奇克夫人有力地摇摇头，在椅子里移正身体，说道，“伊迪丝这个名字，我觉得既不俗，又高贵。因此，卢克丽霞，我毫不怀疑，您将会高兴听到，婚礼不久就要举行了，——当然，您将会高兴，”她又大大地加强了语气，“您将会对我哥哥生活中的这个变化感到快乐，他曾多次极为善意地关心过您。” 托克斯小姐没有用言语回答，但却用颤抖的手拿起小喷水壶，茫然失措地看看四周，仿佛在考虑哪一件家具用壶里的水浇一浇会好一些似的。当托克斯小姐的感情处在这一紧急关头的时候，房间的门开了，她吃了一惊，高声大笑，并倒在进门来的人的怀里；幸亏这时她没有看到奇克夫人的愤怒的脸色，也没有看到广场对过的少校在窗口用双筒望远镜使劲看着，他的脸上和身姿中都显露出梅菲斯托菲尔式的喜悦。 被放逐出国的本地人就是托克斯小姐晕倒的身体的吃惊的支撑者，他这时的心情跟他主人完全不同。他严格执行少校存心不良的指示，走上楼来，打算有礼貌地打听一下托克斯小姐的健康情况，碰巧就在这个紧要的关头到达，把这娇弱的负担接在怀里，而他的鞋子则接受了小喷水壶里流出来的水。这两种情况，再加上他知道怒气冲冲的少校现在正在密切注视他（少校曾威胁他，一旦失败，就要照常对他进行惩罚，他全身的每根骨头都要遭殃），所以他遭受着精神上和肉体上的双重痛苦，情景实在悲惨动人。 这位苦恼的外国人用一种和他仓皇失措的脸部表情绝不相称的劲头，把托克斯小姐在胸前一直抱了好几秒钟，这时候，这位可怜的小姐让小喷水壶里最后的一点水一滴一滴慢慢地流到他身上，仿佛他是一株纤弱的外国植物（他是从外国来的，这点倒也确实），在这小雨的滋润下，几乎可以期待它开出花朵来。奇克夫人终于充分恢复了镇静，开始过问这件事情；她嘱咐本地人把托克斯小姐放到沙发上，然后出去；这位亡命他乡的人立即遵命照办。在这之后，她就投入全部精力，设法使托克斯小姐清醒过来。 这两位夏娃的女儿①平时相互照料中的特色是亲切的关怀，平时把她们联结在神秘的姐妹关系的纽带之中的是遇难相助的互济会精神②，可是这一切在奇克夫人这时的态度中丝毫也看不到了。她这时倒很像先让受难者恢复知觉，然后再对他继续进行折磨的刽子手那样（或者就像在善良的古代人们经常这样做的那样，直到今天所有正直的人们还为此穿着永久性的丧服），采取了嗅醒药瓶、敲手、在脸上冲冷水以及其他有效的措施。当托克斯小姐终于张开眼睛，恢复了精神和知觉的时候，奇克夫人就像离开犯人似地离开了她，而且把被暗杀的丹麦国王的先例颠倒过来，望着她时脸上的神色愤怒多于悲哀③。 -------- ①夏娃的女儿：指妇女。圣经中称人类是由亚当和夏娃所生。 ②互济会：18世纪在英国出现后流行于欧洲的秘密组织，所倡宗旨为互济、友爱、完成大德。 ③莎士比亚著名悲剧《哈姆雷特》叙述丹麦国王（哈姆雷特的父亲）被他的弟弟所暗杀。国王的鬼魂向哈姆雷特透露了事实真相，哈姆雷特后来为他的父亲报了仇。 该剧第一幕第二场： 哈姆雷特：那么你们没有看见它（指国王的鬼魂）的脸吗？ 霍拉旭：啊，看见的，殿下，它的脸颊是掀起的。 哈姆雷特：怎么，它瞧上去像在发怒吗？ 霍拉旭：它脸上悲哀多于愤怒。 托克斯小姐是受害者，但奇克夫人望着她时，脸上的神色反而是愤怒多于悲哀；所以是把被暗杀的丹麦国王的先例颠倒过来了。 “卢克丽霞！”奇克夫人说道，“我不打算掩饰我的感觉。我的眼睛突然睁开了。过去即使是由圣人来告诉我，我也还不会相信这一点。” “我真没出息，招架不住头晕，”托克斯小姐结结巴巴地说道，“我立刻就会好的。” “您立刻就会好的，卢克丽霞！”奇克夫人极其轻蔑地重复着，说道，“您以为我的眼睛瞎了吗？您以为我还是个孩子吗？不对，卢克丽霞！我感谢您！” 托克斯小姐用苦苦哀求和无可奈何的眼光向她的朋友望了一眼，并用手绢捂住脸孔。 “如果昨天或甚至半点钟以前有人把这告诉我的话，”奇克夫人威风凛凛地说道，“那么我想我就忍不住要把他打翻在地。卢克丽霞·托克斯，我的眼睛突然睁开了。阴翳已经从我的眼睛上消失了。”这时奇克夫人做了个抛弃的手势，“我对您的盲目信任已经过去了，卢克丽霞。我的信任已经被您冷酷无情地误用和玩弄了。告诉您，现在您想支吾搪塞是根本办不到的。” “啊！您这么恶狠狠地指的是什么呀，我亲爱的？”托克斯小姐流着眼泪问道。 “卢克丽霞，”奇克夫人说道，“问问您自己的心吧。我务必请求您别再用您刚才使用的那种亲密的字眼来称呼我了。虽然您可能会有另外的想法，但我还留有几分自尊心呢。” “啊，路易莎！”托克斯小姐喊道，“您怎么能这样对我说话呢？” “我怎么能这样对您说话呢？”奇克夫人反驳道；当她找不到有力的论据来支持自己的时候，主要采取这种重复对方话语的办法来达到最能使人胆怯心寒的效果，“这样对您说话！不错，您确实可以问这个问题！” 托克斯小姐可怜地哭泣着。 “想一想吧！”奇克夫人说道，“您曾经像蛇一样在我哥哥的炉边取暖，拐弯抹角地通过我，几乎取得了他的信任，以便对他进行暗算，而且居然还胆敢想到他可能跟您结为夫妻！啊！这个想法真是荒唐可笑极了，”奇克夫人讥讽而尊严地说道，“几乎使人注意不到它所包含的奸诈了。” “求求您，路易莎，”托克斯小姐哀求道，“请您别说这样可怕的事情！” “可怕的事情！”奇克夫人重复道，“可怕的事情！刚才甚至在我面前，在一个被您完全蒙住眼睛的人面前，您都控制不住自己的感情！难道这不是事实吗，卢克丽霞？” “我没有抱怨什么，”托克斯小姐哭泣着说道，“我没有说什么。如果我听到您的消息有些震惊，路易莎，如果我过去心中闪过这样的想法：董贝先生对我特别关心的话，那么您自然是不该责备我的。” “她是想说，”奇克夫人用听天由命和恳求的眼光向所有的家具全都看了一眼，对它们说道，“她是想说——我知道的——我曾经鼓励过她！” “我不希望互相责备，亲爱的路易莎，”托克斯小姐哭泣着说道，“我也不希望抱怨。我只是为我自己辩护——” “对了！奇克夫人含着预见性的微笑，看看房间四周，喊道，“这就是她想要说的。我早料到了。您最好说出来。毫无隐瞒地说出来！要毫无隐瞒，卢克丽霞·托克斯，”奇克夫人严酷无情地说道，“不管您是什么人。” “我是为我自己辩护，”托克斯小姐结结巴巴地说道，“我只是听了您那些冷酷的话以后为我自己辩护几句。我亲爱的路易莎，我只想问您一句，难道您不是也时常纵容这样的幻想的吗，您不是甚至还说，‘谁知道呢？一切都可能发生的’ 吗？” “这里有个界限，”奇克夫人说道，一边站起来，仿佛不打算在地板上站住，而是想腾空飞进天国似的，“超过这个界限，再忍耐下去，不说是有罪的，也成了荒谬可笑的了。我能极大地忍耐；但不能过分忍耐。今天我走进这屋子的时候，究竟我给什么符咒镇住了，我不知道，但是我有一种预感，一种不祥的预感，”奇克夫人哆嗦了一下，说道，“好像要发生什么事情似的。我这预感可不奇巧得很吗，卢克丽霞？我这许多年的信任一刹那间就毁掉了，我的眼睛突然之间睁开了，我看见您露出了您的真面目。卢克丽霞，我过去错看了您了。我们最好就把话讲到这里为止。我祝您好，我将永远祝您好。可是作为一个想忠于她自己的人（她是一个地位卑微的人，不论她的地位可能是卑微的还是可能并不卑微的），作为我哥哥的妹妹、作为我嫂子的小姑子，作为我哥哥岳母的亲戚——是不是可以允许我再加上一句，作为董贝家里的一员——，我除了祝您早上好之外，就不再对您祝愿别的什么了。” 这些话是用尖刻而又平静的语气说出的，而且又是用一种理直气壮的高傲神态进行调节与控制的；话说完之后，说话的人已经走到门口。然后她用鬼怪般的，就像雕像一样的姿态，低着头，回到她的马车里，从她的丈夫奇克先生的怀中寻求安慰和爱抚。 我们在这里是采用比喻性的说法，因为奇克先生的怀里实际上尽是报纸。这位先生的眼睛也没有正面看着她的妻子，只不过是偶尔偷偷地看一眼罢了。他也没有给她任何安慰。总之，他坐在那里阅读着，哼唱着曲调的片断，有时悄悄地看她一眼；不管是好话、坏话、还是不好不坏的话，他一句也不说。 在这同一个时候，奇克夫人坐在那里，怒气冲冲地昂着头，摇来晃去，仿佛还在重复说着向卢克丽霞·托克斯的庄严的告别辞。最后，她高声说道，“啊，今天她的眼睛睁得多么开啊！” “你的眼睛睁得多开啊，我亲爱的？”奇克先生重复着说道。“哦，别跟我讲话！”奇克夫人说道，“如果你能用这样一种姿态看我，也不问一下发生了什么事的话，那么你最好把嘴巴永远闭着。” “发生了什么事啦，我亲爱的？”奇克先生问道。 “想一下吧！”奇克夫人自言自语地说道，“她竟居然抱着这样卑鄙的企图，想通过跟保罗成亲来跟我们家攀上亲戚关系！想一想吧！当她跟那个现在已躺在坟墓里的可爱的孩子玩马的时候——我当时就不喜欢这个游戏——，她竟居然在心里隐藏着这样阴险的野心！我真奇怪，她从不担心这会使她碰上倒霉的事。如果没碰上什么事的话，那她倒走运了。” “亲爱的，我真认为，”奇克先生用报纸把鼻梁擦了一些时候之后，慢吞吞地说道，“直到今天早上之前，你自己也是一直向着同一个目标前进的呢。你还认为，如果能实现的话，这倒是方便极了。” 奇克夫人立刻眼泪夺眶而出地大哭起来，并对奇克先生说，如果他想用靴子踩她的话，那么他最好就踩。 “但是我已经跟卢克丽霞·托克斯一刀两断了，”奇克夫人听凭自己沉溺在迸发的感情之中，使奇克先生感到极大的恐慌；过了几分钟之后，她说道，“我可以容忍保罗向一个人表示喜爱，我希望和相信她是可以受之无愧的；如果他愿意的话，那么他也完全有权利让她来代替可怜的范妮；我可以容忍保罗用他向来不动感情的态度把他计划中的这个变化告诉我，在一切都已决定、办妥之前，一次也没跟我商量过；但是奸诈却是我所不能容忍的；我已跟卢克丽霞·托克斯一刀两断了。像现在这样子倒是更好，”奇克夫人真心诚意地说道，“好得多。要不然，在这之后，我得需要很长的时间才能跟她和解。现在，保罗地位很高，这些人出身又很尊贵，我实在不知道她在那种场合是不是能拿得出去，她会不会糟蹋我的声誉呢？一切事情都有天意，一切事情都向着最好的方面发展；今天我经受了考验，但是我不后悔。” 奇克夫人怀着这种基督徒的精神，擦干了眼泪，抚平膝盖上的衣服，像一个冷静地忍耐着极大委屈的人那样坐着。奇克先生无疑感觉到自己的渺小无用，就趁早找了个机会，在一条街道的拐角下了车，离开了；他高耸着肩膀，手插在衣袋里，一边走，一边吹着口哨。 如果说托克斯小姐是位巴结讨好、喜爱拍马屁的人的话，那么至少她是诚实的和始终如一的；对于现在严厉责备她的人，她过去确实怀着忠实的友谊，而且一心一意、五体投地地崇拜着伟大的董贝先生；这时候，这位可怜的被革除在外的托克斯小姐用她的眼泪浇着花，感到公主广场已经是冬天了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/329/8533.html","bookId":133,"book":{"id":133,"title":"董贝父子
