{"id":3796,"no":48,"title":"Chapter 48","content":"The Flight of Florence\\n\\n In the wildness of her sorrow, shame, and terror, the forlorn girl hurried through the sunshine of a bright morning, as if it were the darkness of a winter night. Wringing her hands and weeping bitterly, insensible to everything but the deep wound in her breast, stunned by the loss of all she loved, left like the sole survivor on a lonely shore from the wreck of a great vessel, she fled without a thought, without a hope, without a purpose, but to fly somewhere anywhere.\\n\\n The cheerful vista of the long street, burnished by the morning light, the sight of the blue sky and airy clouds, the vigorous freshness of the day, so flushed and rosy in its conquest of the night, awakened no responsive feelings in her so hurt bosom. Somewhere, anywhere, to hide her head! somewhere, anywhere, for refuge, never more to look upon the place from which she fled!\\n\\n But there were people going to and fro; there were opening shops, and servants at the doors of houses; there was the rising clash and roar of the day\u0027s struggle. Florence saw surprise and curiosity in the faces flitting past her; saw long shadows coming back upon the pavement; and heard voices that were strange to her asking her where she went, and what the matter was; and though these frightened her the more at first, and made her hurry on the faster, they did her the good service of recalling her in some degree to herself, and reminding her of the necessity of greater composure.\\n\\n Where to go? Still somewhere, anywhere! still going on; but where! She thought of the only other time she had been lost in the wild wilderness of London - though not lost as now - and went that way. To the home of Walter\u0027s Uncle.\\n\\n Checking her sobs, and drying her swollen eyes, and endeavouring to calm the agitation of her manner, so as to avoid attracting notice, Florence, resolving to keep to the more quiet streets as long as she could, was going on more quietly herself, when a familiar little shadow darted past upon the sunny pavement, stopped short, wheeled about, came close to her, made off again, bounded round and round her, and Diogenes, panting for breath, and yet making the street ring with his glad bark, was at her feet.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Di! oh, dear, true, faithful Di, how did you come here? How could I ever leave you, Di, who would never leave me?\u0027\\n\\n Florence bent down on the pavement, and laid his rough, old, loving, foolish head against her breast, and they got up together, and went on together; Di more off the ground than on it, endeavouring to kiss his mistress flying, tumbling over and getting up again without the least concern, dashing at big dogs in a jocose defiance of his species, terrifying with touches of his nose young housemaids who were cleaning doorsteps, and continually stopping, in the midst of a thousand extravagances, to look back at Florence, and bark until all the dogs within hearing answered, and all the dogs who could come out, came out to stare at him.\\n\\n With this last adherent, Florence hurried away in the advancing morning, and the strengthening sunshine, to the City. The roar soon grew more loud, the passengers more numerous, the shops more busy, until she was carried onward in a stream of life setting that way, and flowing, indifferently, past marts and mansions, prisons, churches, market-places, wealth, poverty, good, and evil, like the broad river side by side with it, awakened from its dreams of rushes, willows, and green moss, and rolling on, turbid and troubled, among the works and cares of men, to the deep sea.\\n\\n At length the quarters of the little Midshipman arose in view. Nearer yet, and the little Midshipman himself was seen upon his post, intent as ever on his observations. Nearer yet, and the door stood open, inviting her to enter. Florence, who had again quickened her pace, as she approached the end of her journey, ran across the road (closely followed by Diogenes, whom the bustle had somewhat confused), ran in, and sank upon the threshold of the well-remembered little parlour.\\n\\n The Captain, in his glazed hat, was standing over the fire, making his morning\u0027s cocoa, with that elegant trifle, his watch, upon the chimney-piece, for easy reference during the progress of the cookery. Hearing a footstep and the rustle of a dress, the Captain turned with a palpitating remembrance of the dreadful Mrs MacStinger, at the instant when Florence made a motion with her hand towards him, reeled, and fell upon the floor.\\n\\n The Captain, pale as Florence, pale in the very knobs upon his face raised her like a baby, and laid her on the same old sofa upon which she had slumbered long ago.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s Heart\u0027s Delight!\u0027 said the Captain, looking intently in her face. \u0027It\u0027s the sweet creetur grow\u0027d a woman!\u0027\\n\\n Captain Cuttle was so respectful of her, and had such a reverence for her, in this new character, that he would not have held her in his arms, while she was unconscious, for a thousand pounds.\\n\\n \u0027My Heart\u0027s Delight!\u0027 said the Captain, withdrawing to a little distance, with the greatest alarm and sympathy depicted on his countenance. \u0027If you can hail Ned Cuttle with a finger, do it!\u0027\\n\\n But Florence did not stir.\\n\\n \u0027My Heart\u0027s Delight!\u0027 said the trembling Captain. \u0027For the sake of Wal\u0027r drownded in the briny deep, turn to, and histe up something or another, if able!\u0027\\n\\n Finding her insensible to this impressive adjuration also, Captain Cuttle snatched from his breakfast-table a basin of cold water, and sprinkled some upon her face. Yielding to the urgency of the case, the Captain then, using his immense hand with extraordinary gentleness, relieved her of her bonnet, moistened her lips and forehead, put back her hair, covered her feet with his own coat which he pulled off for the purpose, patted her hand - so small in his, that he was struck with wonder when he touched it - and seeing that her eyelids quivered, and that her lips began to move, continued these restorative applications with a better heart.\\n\\n \u0027Cheerily,\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027Cheerily! Stand by, my pretty one, stand by! There! You\u0027re better now. Steady\u0027s the word, and steady it is. Keep her so! Drink a little drop o\u0027 this here,\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027There you are! What cheer now, my pretty, what cheer now?\u0027\\n\\n At this stage of her recovery, Captain Cuttle, with an imperfect association of a Watch with a Physician\u0027s treatment of a patient, took his own down from the mantel-shelf, and holding it out on his hook, and taking Florence\u0027s hand in his, looked steadily from one to the other, as expecting the dial to do something.\\n\\n \u0027What cheer, my pretty?\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027What cheer now? You\u0027ve done her some good, my lad, I believe,\u0027 said the Captain, under his breath, and throwing an approving glance upon his watch. \u0027Put you back half-an-hour every morning, and about another quarter towards the arternoon, and you\u0027re a watch as can be ekalled by few and excelled by none. What cheer, my lady lass!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Captain Cuttle! Is it you?\u0027 exclaimed Florence, raising herself a little.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, my lady lass,\u0027 said the Captain, hastily deciding in his own mind upon the superior elegance of that form of address, as the most courtly he could think of.\\n\\n \u0027Is Walter\u0027s Uncle here?\u0027 asked Florence.\\n\\n \u0027Here, pretty?\u0027 returned the Captain. \u0027He ain\u0027t been here this many a long day. He ain\u0027t been heerd on, since he sheered off arter poor Wal\u0027r. But,\u0027 said the Captain, as a quotation, \u0027Though lost to sight, to memory dear, and England, Home, and Beauty!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you live here?\u0027 asked Florence.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, my lady lass,\u0027 returned the Captain.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Captain Cuttle!\u0027 cried Florence, putting her hands together, and speaking wildly. \u0027Save me! keep me here! Let no one know where I am! I\u0027ll tell you what has happened by-and-by, when I can. I have no one in the world to go to. Do not send me away!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Send you away, my lady lass!\u0027 exclaimed the Captain. \u0027You, my Heart\u0027s Delight! Stay a bit! We\u0027ll put up this here deadlight, and take a double turn on the key!\u0027\\n\\n With these words, the Captain, using his one hand and his hook with the greatest dexterity, got out the shutter of the door, put it up, made it all fast, and locked the door itself.\\n\\n When he came back to the side of Florence, she took his hand, and kissed it. The helplessness of the action, the appeal it made to him, the confidence it expressed, the unspeakable sorrow in her face, the pain of mind she had too plainly suffered, and was suffering then, his knowledge of her past history, her present lonely, worn, and unprotected appearance, all so rushed upon the good Captain together, that he fairly overflowed with compassion and gentleness.\\n\\n \u0027My lady lass,\u0027 said the Captain, polishing the bridge of his nose with his arm until it shone like burnished copper, \u0027don\u0027t you say a word to Ed\u0027ard Cuttle, until such times as you finds yourself a riding smooth and easy; which won\u0027t be to-day, nor yet to-morrow. And as to giving of you up, or reporting where you are, yes verily, and by God\u0027s help, so I won\u0027t, Church catechism, make a note on!\u0027\\n\\n This the Captain said, reference and all, in one breath, and with much solemnity; taking off his hat at \u0027yes verily,\u0027 and putting it on again, when he had quite concluded.\\n\\n Florence could do but one thing more to thank him, and to show him how she trusted in him; and she did it\u0027 Clinging to this rough creature as the last asylum of her bleeding heart, she laid her head upon his honest shoulder, and clasped him round his neck, and would have kneeled down to bless him, but that he divined her purpose, and held her up like a true man.\\n\\n \u0027Steady!\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027Steady! You\u0027re too weak to stand, you see, my pretty, and must lie down here again. There, there!\u0027 To see the Captain lift her on the sofa, and cover her with his coat, would have been worth a hundred state sights. \u0027And now,\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027you must take some breakfast, lady lass, and the dog shall have some too. And arter that you shall go aloft to old Sol Gills\u0027s room, and fall asleep there, like a angel.\u0027\\n\\n Captain Cuttle patted Diogenes when he made allusion to him, and Diogenes met that overture graciously, half-way. During the administration of the restoratives he had clearly been in two minds whether to fly at the Captain or to offer him his friendship; and he had expressed that conflict of feeling by alternate waggings of his tail, and displays of his teeth, with now and then a growl or so. But by this time, his doubts were all removed. It was plain that he considered the Captain one of the most amiable of men, and a man whom it was an honour to a dog to know.\\n\\n In evidence of these convictions, Diogenes attended on the Captain while he made some tea and toast, and showed a lively interest in his housekeeping. But it was in vain for the kind Captain to make such preparations for Florence, who sorely tried to do some honour to them, but could touch nothing, and could only weep and weep again.\\n\\n \u0027Well, well!\u0027 said the compassionate Captain, \u0027arter turning in, my Heart\u0027s Delight, you\u0027ll get more way upon you. Now, I\u0027ll serve out your allowance, my lad.\u0027 To Diogenes. \u0027And you shall keep guard on your mistress aloft.\u0027\\n\\n Diogenes, however, although he had been eyeing his intended breakfast with a watering mouth and glistening eyes, instead of falling to, ravenously, when it was put before him, pricked up his ears, darted to the shop-door, and barked there furiously: burrowing with his head at the bottom, as if he were bent on mining his way out.\\n\\n \u0027Can there be anybody there!\u0027 asked Florence, in alarm.\\n\\n \u0027No, my lady lass,\u0027 returned the Captain. \u0027Who\u0027d stay there, without making any noise! Keep up a good heart, pretty. It\u0027s only people going by.\u0027\\n\\n But for all that, Diogenes barked and barked, and burrowed and burrowed, with pertinacious fury; and whenever he stopped to listen, appeared to receive some new conviction into his mind, for he set to, barking and burrowing again, a dozen times. Even when he was persuaded to return to his breakfast, he came jogging back to it, with a very doubtful air; and was off again, in another paroxysm, before touching a morsel.\\n\\n \u0027If there should be someone listening and watching,\u0027 whispered Florence. \u0027Someone who saw me come - who followed me, perhaps.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It ain\u0027t the young woman, lady lass, is it?\u0027 said the Captain, taken with a bright idea\\n\\n \u0027Susan?\u0027 said Florence, shaking her head. \u0027Ah no! Susan has been gone from me a long time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not deserted, I hope?\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027Don\u0027t say that that there young woman\u0027s run, my pretty!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, no, no!\u0027 cried Florence. \u0027She is one of the truest hearts in the world!\u0027\\n\\n The Captain was greatly relieved by this reply, and expressed his satisfaction by taking off his hard glazed hat, and dabbing his head all over with his handkerchief, rolled up like a ball, observing several times, with infinite complacency, and with a beaming countenance, that he know\u0027d it.\\n\\n \u0027So you\u0027re quiet now, are you, brother?\u0027 said the Captain to Diogenes. \u0027There warn\u0027t nobody there, my lady lass, bless you!\u0027\\n\\n Diogenes was not so sure of that. The door still had an attraction for him at intervals; and he went snuffing about it, and growling to himself, unable to forget the subject. This incident, coupled with the Captain\u0027s observation of Florence\u0027s fatigue and faintness, decided him to prepare Sol Gills\u0027s chamber as a place of retirement for her immediately. He therefore hastily betook himself to the top of the house, and made the best arrangement of it that his imagination and his means suggested.\\n\\n It was very clean already; and the Captain being an orderly man, and accustomed to make things ship-shape, converted the bed into a couch, by covering it all over with a clean white drapery. By a similar contrivance, the Captain converted the little dressing-table into a species of altar, on which he set forth two silver teaspoons, a flower-pot, a telescope, his celebrated watch, a pocket-comb, and a song-book, as a small collection of rarities, that made a choice appearance. Having darkened the window, and straightened the pieces of carpet on the floor, the Captain surveyed these preparations with great delight, and descended to the little parlour again, to bring Florence to her bower.\\n\\n Nothing would induce the Captain to believe that it was possible for Florence to walk upstairs. If he could have got the idea into his head, he would have considered it an outrageous breach of hospitality to allow her to do so. Florence was too weak to dispute the point, and the Captain carried her up out of hand, laid her down, and covered her with a great watch-coat.\\n\\n \u0027My lady lass!\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027you\u0027re as safe here as if you was at the top of St Paul\u0027s Cathedral, with the ladder cast off. Sleep is what you want, afore all other things, and may you be able to show yourself smart with that there balsam for the still small woice of a wounded mind! When there\u0027s anything you want, my Heart\u0027s Delight, as this here humble house or town can offer, pass the word to Ed\u0027ard Cuttle, as\u0027ll stand off and on outside that door, and that there man will wibrate with joy.\u0027 The Captain concluded by kissing the hand that Florence stretched out to him, with the chivalry of any old knight-errant, and walking on tiptoe out of the room.\\n\\n Descending to the little parlour, Captain Cuttle, after holding a hasty council with himself, decided to open the shop-door for a few minutes, and satisfy himself that now, at all events, there was no one loitering about it. Accordingly he set it open, and stood upon the threshold, keeping a bright look-out, and sweeping the whole street with his spectacles.\\n\\n \u0027How de do, Captain Gills?\u0027 said a voice beside him. The Captain, looking down, found that he had been boarded by Mr Toots while sweeping the horizon.\\n\\n \u0027How are, you, my lad?\u0027 replied the Captain.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I m pretty well, thank\u0027ee, Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots. \u0027You know I\u0027m never quite what I could wish to be, now. I don\u0027t expect that I ever shall be any more.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Toots never approached any nearer than this to the great theme of his life, when in conversation with Captain Cuttle, on account of the agreement between them.\\n\\n \u0027Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027if I could have the pleasure of a word with you, it\u0027s - it\u0027s rather particular.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why, you see, my lad,\u0027 replied the Captain, leading the way into the parlour, \u0027I ain\u0027t what you may call exactly free this morning; and therefore if you can clap on a bit, I should take it kindly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Certainly, Captain Gills,\u0027 replied Mr Toots, who seldom had any notion of the Captain\u0027s meaning. \u0027To clap on, is exactly what I could wish to do. Naturally.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If so be, my lad,\u0027 returned the Captain. \u0027Do it!\u0027\\n\\n The Captain was so impressed by the possession of his tremendous secret - by the fact of Miss Dombey being at that moment under his roof, while the innocent and unconscious Toots sat opposite to him - that a perspiration broke out on his forehead, and he found it impossible, while slowly drying the same, glazed hat in hand, to keep his eyes off Mr Toots\u0027s face. Mr Toots, who himself appeared to have some secret reasons for being in a nervous state, was so unspeakably disconcerted by the Captain\u0027s stare, that after looking at him vacantly for some time in silence, and shifting uneasily on his chair, he said:\\n\\n \u0027I beg your pardon, Captain Gills, but you don\u0027t happen to see anything particular in me, do you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, my lad,\u0027 returned the Captain. \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because you know,\u0027 said Mr Toots with a chuckle, \u0027I kNOW I\u0027m wasting away. You needn\u0027t at all mind alluding to that. I - I should like it. Burgess and Co. have altered my measure, I\u0027m in that state of thinness. It\u0027s a gratification to me. I - I\u0027m glad of it. I - I\u0027d a great deal rather go into a decline, if I could. I\u0027m a mere brute you know, grazing upon the surface of the earth, Captain Gills.\u0027\\n\\n The more Mr Toots went on in this way, the more the Captain was weighed down by his secret, and stared at him. What with this cause of uneasiness, and his desire to get rid of Mr Toots, the Captain was in such a scared and strange condition, indeed, that if he had been in conversation with a ghost, he could hardly have evinced greater discomposure.\\n\\n \u0027But I was going to say, Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots. \u0027Happening to be this way early this morning - to tell you the truth, I was coming to breakfast with you. As to sleep, you know, I never sleep now. I might be a Watchman, except that I don\u0027t get any pay, and he\u0027s got nothing on his mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Carry on, my lad!\u0027 said the Captain, in an admonitory voice.\\n\\n \u0027Certainly, Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots. \u0027Perfectly true! Happening to be this way early this morning (an hour or so ago), and finding the door shut - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027What! were you waiting there, brother?\u0027 demanded the Captain.\\n\\n \u0027Not at all, Captain Gills,\u0027 returned Mr Toots. \u0027I didn\u0027t stop a moment. I thought you were out. But the person said - by the bye, you don\u0027t keep a dog, you, Captain Gills?\u0027\\n\\n The Captain shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027To be sure,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027that\u0027s exactly what I said. I knew you didn\u0027t. There is a dog, Captain Gills, connected with - but excuse me. That\u0027s forbidden ground.\u0027\\n\\n The Captain stared at Mr Toots until he seemed to swell to twice his natural size; and again the perspiration broke out on the Captain\u0027s forehead, when he thought of Diogenes taking it into his head to come down and make a third in the parlour.\\n\\n \u0027The person said,\u0027 continued Mr Toots, \u0027that he had heard a dog barking in the shop: which I knew couldn\u0027t be, and I told him so. But he was as positive as if he had seen the dog.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What person, my lad?\u0027 inquired the Captain.\\n\\n \u0027Why, you see there it is, Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots, with a perceptible increase in the nervousness of his manner. \u0027It\u0027s not for me to say what may have taken place, or what may not have taken place. Indeed, I don\u0027t know. I get mixed up with all sorts of things that I don\u0027t quite understand, and I think there\u0027s something rather weak in my - in my head, in short.\u0027\\n\\n The Captain nodded his own, as a mark of assent.\\n\\n \u0027But the person said, as we were walking away,\u0027 continued Mr Toots, \u0027that you knew what, under existing circumstances, might occur - he said \"might,\" very strongly - and that if you were requested to prepare yourself, you would, no doubt, come prepared.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Person, my lad\u0027 the Captain repeated.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what person, I\u0027m sure, Captain Gills,\u0027 replied Mr Toots, \u0027I haven\u0027t the least idea. But coming to the door, I found him waiting there; and he said was I coming back again, and I said yes; and he said did I know you, and I said, yes, I had the pleasure of your acquaintance - you had given me the pleasure of your acquaintance, after some persuasion; and he said, if that was the case, would I say to you what I have said, about existing circumstances and coming prepared, and as soon as ever I saw you, would I ask you to step round the corner, if it was only for one minute, on most important business, to Mr Brogley\u0027s the Broker\u0027s. Now, I tell you what, Captain Gills - whatever it is, I am convinced it\u0027s very important; and if you like to step round, now, I\u0027ll wait here till you come back.\u0027\\n\\n The Captain, divided between his fear of compromising Florence in some way by not going, and his horror of leaving Mr Toots in possession of the house with a chance of finding out the secret, was a spectacle of mental disturbance that even Mr Toots could not be blind to. But that young gentleman, considering his nautical friend as merely in a state of preparation for the interview he was going to have, was quite satisfied, and did not review his own discreet conduct without chuckle\\n\\n At length the Captain decided, as the lesser of two evils, to run round to Brogley\u0027s the Broker\u0027s: previously locking the door that communicated with the upper part of the house, and putting the key in his pocket. \u0027If so be,\u0027 said the Captain to Mr Toots, with not a little shame and hesitation, \u0027as you\u0027ll excuse my doing of it, brother.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Captain Gills,\u0027 returned Mr Toots, \u0027whatever you do, is satisfactory to me.\\n\\n The Captain thanked him heartily, and promising to come back in less than five minutes, went out in quest of the person who had entrusted Mr Toots with this mysterious message. Poor Mr Toots, left to himself, lay down upon the sofa, little thinking who had reclined there last, and, gazing up at the skylight and resigning himself to visions of Miss Dombey, lost all heed of time and place.\\n\\n It was as well that he did so; for although the Captain was not gone long, he was gone much longer than he had proposed. When he came back, he was very pale indeed, and greatly agitated, and even looked as if he had been shedding tears. He seemed to have lost the faculty of speech, until he had been to the cupboard and taken a dram of rum from the case-bottle, when he fetched a deep breath, and sat down in a chair with his hand before his face.\\n\\n \u0027Captain Gills,\u0027 said Toots, kindly, \u0027I hope and trust there\u0027s nothing wrong?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank\u0027ee, my lad, not a bit,\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027Quite contrairy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have the appearance of being overcome, Captain Gills,\u0027 observed Mr Toots.\\n\\n \u0027Why, my lad, I am took aback,\u0027 the Captain admitted. \u0027I am.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is there anything I can do, Captain Gills?\u0027 inquired Mr Toots. \u0027If there is, make use of me.\u0027\\n\\n The Captain removed his hand from his face, looked at him with a remarkable expression of pity and tenderness, and took him by the hand, and shook it hard.\\n\\n \u0027No, thank\u0027ee,\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027Nothing. Only I\u0027ll take it as a favour if you\u0027ll part company for the present. I believe, brother,\u0027 wringing his hand again, \u0027that, after Wal\u0027r, and on a different model, you\u0027re as good a lad as ever stepped.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Upon my word and honour, Captain Gills,\u0027 returned Mr Toots, giving the Captain\u0027s hand a preliminary slap before shaking it again, \u0027it\u0027s delightful to me to possess your good opinion. Thank\u0027ee.\\n\\n \u0027And bear a hand and cheer up,\u0027 said the Captain, patting him on the back. \u0027What! There\u0027s more than one sweet creetur in the world!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not to me, Captain Gills,\u0027 replied Mr Toots gravely. \u0027Not to me, I assure you. The state of my feelings towards Miss Dombey is of that unspeakable description, that my heart is a desert island, and she lives in it alone. I\u0027m getting more used up every day, and I\u0027m proud to be so. If you could see my legs when I take my boots off, you\u0027d form some idea of what unrequited affection is. I have been prescribed bark, but I don\u0027t take it, for I don\u0027t wish to have any tone whatever given to my constitution. I\u0027d rather not. This, however, is forbidden ground. Captain Gills, goodbye!\u0027\\n\\n Captain Cuttle cordially reciprocating the warmth of Mr Toots\u0027s farewell, locked the door behind him, and shaking his head with the same remarkable expression of pity and tenderness as he had regarded him with before, went up to see if Florence wanted him.\\n\\n There was an entire change in the Captain\u0027s face as he went upstairs. He wiped his eyes with his handkerchief, and he polished the bridge of his nose with his sleeve as he had done already that morning, but his face was absolutely changed. Now, he might have been thought supremely happy; now, he might have been thought sad; but the kind of gravity that sat upon his features was quite new to them, and was as great an improvement to them as if they had undergone some sublimating process.\\n\\n He knocked softly, with his hook, at Florence\u0027s door, twice or thrice; but, receiving no answer, ventured first to peep in, and then to enter: emboldened to take the latter step, perhaps, by the familiar recognition of Diogenes, who, stretched upon the ground by the side of her couch, wagged his tail, and winked his eyes at the Captain, without being at the trouble of getting up.\\n\\n She was sleeping heavily, and moaning in her sleep; and Captain Cuttle, with a perfect awe of her youth, and beauty, and her sorrow, raised her head, and adjusted the coat that covered her, where it had fallen off, and darkened the window a little more that she might sleep on, and crept out again, and took his post of watch upon the stairs. All this, with a touch and tread as light as Florence\u0027s own.\\n\\n Long may it remain in this mixed world a point not easy of decision, which is the more beautiful evidence of the Almighty\u0027s goodness - the delicate fingers that are formed for sensitiveness and sympathy of touch, and made to minister to pain and grief, or the rough hard Captain Cuttle hand, that the heart teaches, guides, and softens in a moment!\\n\\n Florence slept upon her couch, forgetful of her homelessness and orphanage, and Captain Cuttle watched upon the stairs. A louder sob or moan than usual, brought him sometimes to her door; but by degrees she slept more peacefully, and the Captain\u0027s watch was undisturbed.\\n\\n 这位孤独无助的女孩子怀着极度的悲痛、羞耻与恐怖，在晴朗的早晨的阳光中奔跑着，仿佛这是一个黑暗的冬夜一样。她使劲绞扭着自己的手，痛苦地哭着，除了胸中深刻的创伤之外，什么也感觉不到；由于失去了她所爱的一切，她晕眩发愣；就像一只大船遭难以后在荒凉的海滨唯一还活下来的人一样，她没有思想，没有希望，没有目的地奔跑着，只想跑到一个什么地方去——任何地方都可以。\\n\\n 长街的林荫路景被晨曦抹上一层光泽，令人赏心悦目；蓝色的天空中飘浮着几朵轻轻的白云；白天战胜黑夜之后，精神抖擞，生气勃勃，脸上泛上一片红晕；但这一切在她破碎的心中却唤不起任何反应的感情。到一个什么地方去，任何地方都可以，只要能把她隐藏起来就行！到一个什么地方去，任何地方都可以，只要能找到一个避身之处，永远也不再去看到她逃出来的地方就行！\\n\\n 可是街道上行人来来往往；商店开着门，仆人们出现在房屋的门口；人们为日常生活与工作奔忙而引起的纷争与喧嚣正在逐渐增加。弗洛伦斯看到从她身旁匆匆走过的脸上露出了惊异与好奇的表情，看到长长的影子怎样又返回到人行道上；她听到陌生的在问她，她到哪里去，发生了什么事；虽然这些情况最初使她更加惊恐，促使她加快步子，更加急忙地往前跑去，可是它们却同时使她在一定程度上恢复冷静，并提醒她必须更加泰然自若，这对她是有好处的。\\n\\n 到哪里去？仍然是到一个什么地方去，任何地方都可以！仍然是一直往前走。可是走到哪里去呢？她想起她在唯一的另一次，曾经在这宽阔茫茫的伦敦迷了路——虽然并不是像现在这样迷了路——，于是就沿着那条路走去。到沃尔特舅舅的家里去。\\n\\n 弗洛伦斯抑制住啜泣，擦干了臃肿的眼睛，竭力使她激动的心情平静下来，以免引起行人的注意，并决定尽可能沿着行人比较稀少的街道走，她自己也更镇静了；这时候一个熟悉的小影子飞快地冲到阳光照射着的人行道上来，突然停住，转着圈子，跑近她的身边，然后又跑开，在她的四周跳跃着，原来是戴奥吉尼斯跑到她的脚边来了；它喘着气，但仍让街上响彻了它的快乐的吠叫声。\\n\\n “啊，戴！啊亲爱的、真诚的、忠实的戴，你怎么跑到这里来的？你永远也不会离开我，我怎么能离开你呢，戴？”\\n\\n 弗洛伦斯在人行道上弯下身去，把他的毛发蓬乱、久已熟悉、感情深切而又傻里傻气的头紧贴在她的胸前，然后一道站起来，一道向前走去。戴跳离地面的时间比在地上走的时间还多，因为它力图飞跳起来去吻他的女主人；它在地上打滚，然后又无忧无虑地起来，向大狗猛冲过去，向它的同类开玩笑地进行挑战；它吓唬正在清扫门阶的年轻女仆，用鼻子去碰她们；它还经常在作了种种放纵的行为之后，突然停下来，回头看着弗洛伦斯，并吠叫着，直到后来附近所有能听到的狗都响应地吠叫起来，所有能跑出来的狗都跑出来瞪着眼睛看着它。\\n\\n 弗洛伦斯跟这个最后的追随者一起，在早晨时间的流逝中，在逐渐热起来的阳光中，向着伦敦城赶紧走去。不久，喧嚣声更响了，行人更多了，商店更忙碌了，直到后来，朝着这个方向流去的生活的溪流载着她向前流去，它像和它并排流动的宽阔的大河一样漠不关心地流过商业中心地带，流过大厦，流过监狱，流过教堂、流过市集，流过财富，流过贫困，流过善与恶；它曾经梦到过芦苇、杨柳与青苔，这时它从这些梦中醒过来，在人们的工作中与忧虑中，混浊不清、起伏不平地滚滚流向深海。\\n\\n 终于，小海军军官候补生管辖的地盘已经出现在眼前了。再走近一些，小海军军官候补生本人也看得见了；他站在他的岗位上，像往常一样，专心致志地观察着。再走近一些，开着的门在邀请她进去。弗洛伦斯在接近旅程终点时已重新加快了步伐，这时跑着穿过了道路（戴奥吉尼斯紧紧跟着，街上熙熙攘攘、乱乱哄哄的景象使它莫名其妙），从门中穿了进去，倒在她记得清清楚楚的小客厅的门槛上。\\n\\n 船长戴着上了光的帽子，站在炉火前面，正煮着早晨的可可；他那精致漂亮的玩艺儿——他的表搁在壁炉架上，这样他在煮可可的时候就可以方便地知道时间。他听到脚步声和衣服移动时发出的窸窣声，心房怦怦跳动地想起可怕的麦克斯适杰太太，于是就转过身去；就在这个时刻，弗洛伦斯向他伸出手，头脑发晕，倒在地板上。\\n\\n 船长脸色像弗洛伦斯一样苍白，脸上的每一个疙瘩都苍白了；他把她像个婴孩一样托了起来，放在她好久以前曾经睡过的那张沙发上。\\n\\n “这是心的喜悦！”船长目不转睛地注视着她的脸，说道，“这就是那个可爱的小人儿，现在已长成一个大姑娘了！”\\n\\n 卡特尔船长对她是这样有礼貌，对现已成年的她是这样尊敬，就是给他一千镑，他也不会在她没有知觉的情况下把她抱在怀里的。\\n\\n “我的心的喜悦！”船长向后退了几步，脸上露出极大的惊慌与同情，说道：“如果您能用个指头给内德·卡特尔打出一个信号，那就请打出吧！”\\n\\n 可是弗洛伦斯没有动。\\n\\n “我的心的喜悦！”颤抖着的船长说道。“看在淹死在深海中的沃尔特的分上，随风转舵吧；如果可能的话，那么就请升上一面什么旗吧！”\\n\\n 卡特尔船长看到她对这打动人心的恳求也毫无感觉，就从吃早餐的桌子上取来一盆冷水，洒了一些在她脸上。由于情况紧急，船长用他的大手非常轻柔地摘下她的帽子，蘸湿她的嘴唇和前额，把她的头发撩回去，还特地脱下他自己的外套，盖在她的脚上，并轻轻地拍着她的手——她的手在他的手中显得那么小，他接触到它的时候，感到万分惊讶——；当他看到她的眼皮在颤动，她的嘴唇开始翕动的时候，他怀着轻松一些的心情，继续进行这些抢救措施。\\n\\n “高高兴兴地，”船长说道，“高高兴兴地！做好准备，我的宝贝，做好准备！就这样！您现在好一些了。沉着气！别着急！就这么办！现在喝几滴吧，”船长说道，“您看，我说对了吧！现在怎么样，我的宝贝，现在怎么样？”\\n\\n 在她开始慢慢恢复过来的时候，卡特尔船长把表跟医生诊察病人的方法模糊地联系起来了；他从壁炉架上取下表，挂在他的钩子上，然后把弗洛伦斯的手放在他的手里，不断地一会儿看看手，一会儿看看表，好像指望从表的针盘上看到什么似的。\\n\\n “现在怎么样，我的宝贝？”船长说道，“现在怎么样？我觉得，你已给她帮了一些忙，我的孩子，”船长低声说道，一边向表赞许地看了一眼。“每天早上把你拨回半小时，每天傍晚把你拨回大约一刻钟，这样就只有少数几只表能跟你不分高低，能超过你的就绝对没有了。现在怎么样，我的小姑娘夫人？”\\n\\n “卡特尔船长，是您吗？”弗洛伦斯稍稍欠起身来，喊道。\\n\\n “是的，是的，我的小姑娘夫人，”船长在心中急忙决定采用这个最优美的称呼方式，这是他所能想出来的最尊敬的称呼方式。\\n\\n “沃尔特舅舅在这里吗？”弗洛伦斯问道。\\n\\n “在这里吗，宝贝？”船长回答道，“他已好久不在这里了。自从他出去寻找可怜的沃尔特以后，就没有听到他的消息了。不过，”船长采用了一段引语，说道，“虽然已看不到他了，但却仍亲切地怀念着他；英国，故乡与美丽万岁！”\\n\\n “您住在这里吗？”弗洛伦斯问道。\\n\\n “是的，我的小姑娘夫人，”船长回答道。\\n\\n “啊，卡特尔船长，”弗洛伦斯喊道，一边把两只手合在一起，疯狂似地说着。“救救我吧！把我留在这里吧！别让任何人知道我在哪里！不久等我恢复精力以后，我会把发生的事情告诉您的。在这世界上，我已没有可以投靠的人了。别把我打发走吧！”\\n\\n “把您打发走，我的小姑娘夫人！”船长高声喊道。“您，我的心的喜悦，等一会儿，我们把舷窗盖关紧，把钥匙在锁眼里转动两次！”\\n\\n 船长说完之后，就极其熟练地用一只手和他的钩子从门上取下护窗板，把它关上，并把门锁紧。\\n\\n 当他回到弗洛伦斯身边的时候，她拉过他的手，吻了吻它。她在这个动作中表达出她无依无靠的处境，也表达了她对他的恳求和她对他的信任；在她脸上流露出难以形容的悲伤。她在精神上无疑曾经受到而且还继续受着痛苦；他知道她过去的历史，又看到她现在孤苦伶仃、精疲力竭、毫无保护的状态，——所有这一切全都涌集到善良的船长的心头，使他充满了怜悯与温厚的感情。\\n\\n “我的小姑娘夫人，”船长说道，一边用袖子擦着鼻梁，把它擦得像磨亮的铜一样，闪闪发亮，“在你觉得能风平浪静、从容自在地航行之前，请一个字也别跟爱德华·卡特尔说。不在今天，也不在明天。至于说把您抛弃，或者去报告您在哪里，那么说实话，依靠上帝帮助，我是不会干这种事情的。请去翻一下《教义问答》，在找到这句话的地方，请做个记号！”\\n\\n 这些话连同《教义问答》的引语，船长是一口气说出来的，说时一本正经，在说到“说实话”的时候，他摘下了帽子，在所有的话都说完之后又把它戴上。\\n\\n 弗洛伦斯唯一能做的事就是感谢他，并向他表示她信任他，她这样做了。她抱住这个性格粗犷的人，把他作为她悲痛的心的最后一个庇护所；她把头靠在他的诚实的肩膀上，搂着他的脖子，本来还想跪下去感谢他，可是他猜到了她的意图，就像一个真正的男子汉一样制止了她。\\n\\n “镇静！”船长说道。“镇静！您知道，我的宝贝，您太虚弱了，不好站着，必须再躺到这里来。好了，好了！”看看船长怎样把她托起来，放到沙发上，并把他的外套覆盖着她，即使把成百个壮丽的景色丢开不看，那也是值得的，“现在，”船长说道，“您必须吃点早饭，小姑娘夫人，这条狗也要吃点。\\n\\n 然后您上楼到老所尔·吉尔斯的房间去，像天使一样睡一觉。”\\n\\n 卡特尔船长提到戴奥吉尼斯的时候，抚摸抚摸它，戴奥吉尼斯亲切地迎着他走过去接受这一建议。在船长对弗洛伦斯进行抢救措施的时候，他显然打不定主意，是向船长猛扑过去呢，还是向他表示友好。他感情上的这种斗争，表现在或者摇摇尾巴，或者露露牙齿，有时还嗥叫一、两声。但到这时他的疑团已完全消除了。很明显，他认为船长是最和蔼可亲的人们当中的一位，跟他认识对任何一条狗来说都是光荣的。\\n\\n 可以证明他怀有这样信念的是，当船长在泡茶和烤面包片的时候，他一直跟随着船长，并对他的家务管理表示出浓厚的兴趣。可是仁厚的船长给弗洛伦斯准备这些饮食却是白费力气，她本想要表示一点领情的心意，尽量设法吃一点，但却什么也吃不下去，而只能哭着，不住地哭着。\\n\\n “好了，好了，”富有同情心的船长说道，“你需要睡觉了，我的心的喜悦，睡一觉之后你跑的航程会更多。现在，我要给你发口粮了，我的孩子。”他对戴奥吉尼斯说道。“在这之后，你应当到楼上去守卫你的女主人。”\\n\\n 戴奥吉尼斯起初虽然流着口水，眼睛闪着亮光，直盯盯地看着指定给他的早餐，但是当把早餐端到他面前的时候，他却没有饿得迫不及待地向它扑过去，而是竖起耳朵，奔到店门边，狂暴地吠叫着，并用鼻面在门槛下面打着洞，仿佛他想要掘通一条出路似的。\\n\\n “难道那里有什么人吗？”弗洛伦斯惊恐地问道。\\n\\n “没有，我的小姑娘夫人，”船长回答道。“有谁到这里会不敲门的呢？大胆些，别害怕，宝贝。看来只不过有人路过这里罢了。”\\n\\n 可是虽然这么说，戴奥吉尼斯仍怀着难以消除的怒气，吠叫着，吠叫着，在门槛下面打着洞，打着洞；每当他停下来听一听的时候，他总好像是更有信心似的，因为他又开始吠叫和打洞，这样反复了十多次。甚至当劝他回去吃早餐的时候，他还是露出十分疑惑的神色，慢吞吞地走着；然后一口也没吃，又突然发起怒来，向门口猛冲过去。\\n\\n “是不是有什么人在那里偷听和偷看？”弗洛伦斯低声说道，“也许有什么人看到我到这里来了——有什么人跟随着我吧。”\\n\\n “那位姑娘不会到这里来吧，小姑娘夫人？”船长心中忽然闪现出一个想法，就这样问道。\\n\\n “苏珊？”弗洛伦斯摇摇头，说道。“嗳，不会的！苏珊早就离开我了。”\\n\\n “我希望，不是抛开你，擅自离走的吧？”船长问道。“别跟我讲那位姑娘逃跑的事，我的宝贝！”\\n\\n “啊，不，不！”弗洛伦斯喊道，“她的心是世界上最忠诚的心当中的一个。”\\n\\n 船长听到这个回答，感到十分宽慰，他取下那顶上了光的硬帽子，用卷得像一只球似的手绢轻轻拍打着脑袋各处，并怀着无比自得的心情，露出喜气洋洋的神色，几次重复说道，他知道这一点，他就这样来表示他的满意。\\n\\n “好了，你现在安静了，是不是，老弟？”船长对戴奥吉尼斯说道，“那里没有什么人，我的小姑娘夫人，上帝保佑您！”\\n\\n 戴奥吉尼斯对这一点倒并不是那么确信无疑。门仍不时吸引他的注意。他嗅嗅它，嗥叫着。没有把这件事忘记。这个情况，以及船长注意到弗洛伦斯的疲倦和虚弱，使卡特尔船长决定立即把所尔·吉尔斯的卧房收拾收拾，作为她隐居休息的地方。因此他急忙跑到房屋顶层，凭着他的想象和他能够动用的材料，把它尽可能布置得好一些。\\n\\n 房间已经很干净了；船长是个有条理的人，习惯于把东西收拾得像船里一样整整齐齐；他把床改成一张躺椅，在上面盖一块干净的白布；船长采用类似的设计，把化妆台改成一个类似圣坛似的东西；他在上面摆了两只银茶匙，一个花盆，一架望远镜，他的有名的表，一只可以随身携带的梳子，一本歌曲集；这些珍品集合在一起，看上去十分优美。船长把窗帘拉下，使房间的光线阴暗一些，又把地板上的地毯拉平，然后十分高兴地把这些布置好了的物品打量了一番以后，又走到楼下的小客厅里去把弗洛伦斯安置到她的闺房里来。\\n\\n 船长无论如何也不会相信弗洛伦斯有力气走上楼去；如果他真以为她有力气上去的话，那么他也认为让弗洛伦斯独自上楼，是粗暴地违反了他殷勤款待客人的规则。弗洛伦斯太虚弱了，不能不同意他的这个看法，所以船长立即用手把她托着送上楼，然后放下来，用航海值班时穿着的一件厚大衣盖在她身上。\\n\\n “我的小姑娘夫人，”船长说道，“我把梯子抽掉以后，您在这里就像待在圣保罗大教堂里一样安全了。您首先需要睡觉；您的受了创伤的心还有一些痛，但采用香膏治疗之后，也许能使你精神愉快起来！我的心的喜悦，如果您需要什么东西，这个粗陋的住宅或这个城市能够提供的话，那么请您就对爱德华·卡特尔说一句；他将到门外去给您站岗放哨，这样您就会使他心里高兴，精神振奋的。”船长说完之后，像一位老游侠骑士一样，崇敬有礼地吻了吻弗洛伦斯向他伸出的手，并踮着脚尖走出了房间。\\n\\n 卡特尔船长走到楼下小会客室里，心里急忙琢磨了一番之后，决定把店门打开几分钟，使他自己放心，至少现在没有什么人在附近闲逛。因此，他打开门，站在门槛上，小心戒备，戴上眼镜，扫视着整个街道。\\n\\n “您好，吉尔斯船长！”他身旁的一个声音说道。船长低头看，发现当他向远处扫视的时候，图茨先生已经靠近他了。\\n\\n “您好吗，我的孩子，”船长回答道。\\n\\n “唔，我很好，谢谢您，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生说道，“您知道，我从没有像现在感觉得这么好，这正是我所希望的。\\n\\n 我也不指望今后什么时候还能会这样好的了。”\\n\\n 图茨先生跟卡特尔船长谈话的时候，从来没有像现在这样明白地暗示过他生活中的这个重要的话题，因为他遵守他们之间达成的协议。\\n\\n “吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生说道，“如果我能荣幸地跟您谈一句话的话，这是——这是一件重要的事情。”\\n\\n “啊，您听我说，我的孩子，”船长回答道，一边把他领到客厅里，“今天早上我不很空；所以您如果能急忙张帆的话，那么我将会十分感谢。”\\n\\n “当然，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生回答道，他不太明白船长话中的含意。“急忙张帆，这正是我希望要做的事情。这是很自然的。”\\n\\n “如果是这样的话，我的孩子，”船长回答道，“那就请这么做吧。”\\n\\n 船长由于保守着那极大的秘密——董贝小姐这时候就在他的家里，而天真的图茨先生则坐在他的对面，对这一无所知——，心神十分不定，额上都冒出了一颗汗珠。当他手里拿着上了光的帽子，慢条斯理地把它擦干的时候，他觉得他不能把眼睛从图茨先生的脸上移开。看来，图茨先生本人也有一些秘密的理由使他感到紧张不安；船长的凝视使他心烦意乱；他默默地、发呆地向他看了一些时候，很不自在地在椅子上移来移去，然后说道：\\n\\n “请原谅，吉尔斯船长，您没有看到我有什么特殊的地方吧，是不是？”\\n\\n “没有，我的孩子，”船长回答道，“没有。”\\n\\n “因为您知道，”图茨先生吃吃地笑了一下，说道，“我知道我瘦了。您丝毫不必顾虑，指出这一点好了。我——我喜欢这样。我瘦得这个样子，伯吉斯公司已经重新量了我的尺寸。我感到满意。我——我喜欢这样。如果我能做得到的话，那么我真十分愿意衰弱下去。您知道，我只不过是一头在地面上吃草的畜牲罢了。吉尔斯船长。”\\n\\n 图茨先生愈是这样滔滔不绝地说下去，船长被他自己的秘密压得愈是难受，也就愈是凝神地注视着他。由于存在这样一个使他感到不安的原因，又由于他一心想摆脱掉图茨先生，所以他当时处在十分惶恐与奇怪的状态中；如果他是在跟一个鬼怪交谈的话，那么他也未必会露出更为心绪不宁的神色的。\\n\\n “可是我现在想跟您谈一下，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生说道，“今天早上我正好往这里走过来，——说老实话吧，我想来跟您一道吃早饭。至于睡觉，您知道，我现在完全不睡觉了。我可以说跟一位更夫一样，所不同的是，没有人给我发工资，更夫也没有什么沉重的心事。”\\n\\n “说下去，我的孩子！”船长用警告的语气说道。\\n\\n “当然，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生说道。“完全正确！今天早上我正好往这里走过来（大概在一个小时以前），发现门关着——”\\n\\n “怎么！是·您在门口等候着呀，老弟？”船长问道。\\n\\n “完全不是，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生回答道。“我片刻也没有停留。我以为您出去了。可是那人说——顺便问一下，您家里没有养狗吧，·是·不·是，吉尔斯船长？”\\n\\n 船长摇摇头。\\n\\n “不错，”图茨先生说道，“我也正是这样说的。我知道您没有养狗。有一条狗，吉尔斯船长，是属于——不过对不起。\\n\\n 那是禁区。”\\n\\n 船长凝神看着图茨先生，直到他的身形似乎比原来的大出一倍为止；当船长想到戴奥吉尼斯忽然想要跑到楼下来，成为客厅里的第三者的时候，他的额上又冒汗了。\\n\\n “那个人说，“图茨先生继续说道，“他听见有条狗在这店里叫；但我知道这是不可能的，我也是这样对他说的；可是他说得那么斩钉截铁，仿佛他亲眼看到那条狗似的。”\\n\\n “是个什么人，我的孩子？”船长问道。\\n\\n “唔，您看，事情是这样的，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生神态显得更加紧张不安，说道，“这不该由我来说什么事情可能发生或什么事情可能不会发生。确实，我不知道。我把我不十分明白的各种事情全混淆了，我觉得我的——直截了当地说吧，我觉得我的脑子有些差劲。”\\n\\n 船长点点头，表示同意。\\n\\n “可是当我们离开的时候，”图茨先生继续说道，“那个人说，您知道在目前情况下·可·能会发生什么事情——他说‘可能’这两个字的时候是很富于表情的。——他还说，如果请您做好准备的话，那么您无疑就会做好准备的。”\\n\\n “这是个什么人，我的孩子？”船长重复问道。\\n\\n “确实，我不知道这是个什么人，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生回答道，“我一点也不知道。不过我走到门口的时候，发现他在那里等候着；他问我是不是还回来，我说还回来，他问我是不是认识您，我说是的，在我向您请求之后，我荣幸地跟您结识了；他说，如果是这样的话，那么我是不是跟您说一说我刚才已经对您说过的，关于在目前情况下和做好准备等等那些话；他还说，是不是我一见到您，就请您拐过这条街角，到经纪人布罗格利先生那里去一下。哪怕去一分钟也好，因为有一件极为重要的事情。我不知道这是一件什么事情，但我相信那是很重要的；如果您高兴现在就去，那么我可以在这里等您回来。”\\n\\n 船长担心不去会在某些方面连累到弗洛伦斯，但又怕把图茨先生单独留在屋子里，他可能碰巧会发现那个秘密，这左右为难的考虑使他心烦意乱，甚至连图茨先生也看出来了。不过这位年轻的先生以为他这位海员朋友只不过是在为即将进行的会晤进行准备，所以感到很满意，当他回想到自己谨慎的行为时，他还吃吃地笑了几声。\\n\\n 两害相权取其轻。船长终于决定到经纪人布罗格利那里去，并事先把通到楼上的门锁上，钥匙放在他自己的衣袋中。\\n\\n “如果是这样的话，”船长不是毫无羞愧与犹豫地对图茨先生说道，“请您原谅我这么做吧，老弟。”\\n\\n “吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生回答道，“不论您做什么，我都是满意的。”\\n\\n 船长由衷地感谢他，答应在不到五分钟的时间内回来，然后就出去寻找那位托图茨先生捎带这神秘口讯的人。可怜的图茨先生在独自留下的时候，躺在沙发上，根本没有猜想到谁曾经在这里躺过，同时仰望着天窗，沉陷在对董贝小姐的胡思乱想之中，忘记了时间与地点。\\n\\n 对他来说这样倒也有好处；因为船长虽然走了不久，但比他原先提出的时间还是长久好多。他回来的时候，脸色苍白，情绪十分激动，甚至看去仿佛流过眼泪似的。他似乎失去了说话的能力，直到他走到碗柜跟前，深深地吸了一口气，用手捂着脸，在椅子中坐下来为止。\\n\\n “吉尔斯船长，”图茨亲切地问道，“我希望，而且我也相信，没有什么不好的事情吧？”\\n\\n “谢谢您，我的孩子，一点也没有。”船长说道，“情况恰恰相反。”\\n\\n “从您的神态看，您太激动了，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生说道。\\n\\n “唔，我的孩子，我被吓了一跳，”船长承认道，“确实是这样。”\\n\\n “我能帮助您做点事情吗，吉尔斯船长？”图茨先生说道。\\n\\n “如果有什么事情需要我帮助的话，那么您就指派我去做吧。”\\n\\n 船长把手从脸上拿下来，露出某种异常怜悯与亲切的表情看着他，并拉住他的手，紧紧地握着。\\n\\n “没有，谢谢您，”船长说道。“没有什么事。不过如果您现在跟我告别的话，那么我就觉得您是给我做了一件好事了。我相信，老弟，”他又紧握着他的手，“除了沃尔特，您是世界上最好的孩子了，虽然您跟他是不同的类型。”\\n\\n “说实话，我以荣誉发誓，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生回答道，他先轻轻地拍了一下船长的手，然后又握着它，“我真高兴能得到您的好评。谢谢您。”\\n\\n “请您帮个忙，高兴起来吧，”船长拍拍他的背，说道。\\n\\n “有什么了不起！世界上可爱的姑娘不止一个哪！”\\n\\n “对我来说不是这样，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生一本正经地回答道。“请相信我，对我来说不是这样。我对董贝小姐的感情是难以形容的；我的心是一个荒岛，只有她一个人住在上面。我一天天地消瘦下去，我对这感到自豪。如果您能看到我脱掉靴子以后的腿，那么您对什么是单恋就可以有一点概念了。医生给我开药方，让我服规那皮，可是我没有服，因为我根本不想增强我的体质。是的，我不想。不过，这是禁区。吉尔斯船长，再见！”\\n\\n 卡特尔船长真心诚意地回答了图茨先生热情的告别，然后把门锁上，一边露出和他刚才看图茨时同样异常的怜悯与亲切的表情，摇着头，一边上楼去看看弗洛伦斯是否需要他帮忙。\\n\\n 船长上楼去的时候，脸上的表情完全改变了。他用手绢抹去眼泪，又像他这天早上所做的那样，用袖子擦亮他的鼻梁；可是他脸上的表情是截然不同地改变了。他一会儿看上去是无比地快乐，一会儿看上去又像是怀着悲伤的心情；但是在他脸上有一种庄重的神色，却是过去从来没有过的，它使他的容貌变得漂亮起来了，仿佛他的脸已经历过某种升华的过程似的。\\n\\n 他用钩子轻轻地在弗洛伦斯的门上敲了两、三下；但是得不到任何回答，他就大胆地先往里窥探了一下，然后走进去；他之所以大胆地采取了后一个步骤，也许是因为戴奥吉尼斯把他当做熟人来欢迎的缘故。戴奥吉尼斯伸直身子，躺在她的睡椅旁边的地上，向船长摇着尾巴，眨巴着眼睛，但却懒得起来。\\n\\n 她正在酣睡，在睡眠中还哼叫着。卡特尔船长对她的年轻、美丽和忧伤怀着完全崇敬的心情，抬起她的头，把这时已经掉落的大衣重新拉好，复盖在她身上，并把窗帘遮蔽得更严密一些，使她可以继续好好地睡觉，然后又踮着脚尖，走出房间，在楼梯上守卫。他所做的这一切，不论是接触一下还是移动一下脚步，全都是轻悄悄的，就像弗洛伦斯自己的一样。\\n\\n 在这复杂的世界上可能还会长久留下一个不易判断的问题：哪一个能更美好地证明全能的上帝的慈善？——是那创造出来，为了进行同情的、温存的抚摸，并用来减轻痛苦与悲哀的巧妙的手指呢？还是那只由心灵进行教育、指导并能在片刻间使它变得温柔起来的、卡特尔船长的粗糙的、坚硬的手呢？\\n\\n 弗洛伦斯在她的躺椅中睡着，忘记了她无家可归、孤苦伶仃的处境；卡特尔船长则在楼梯上守卫着。一声比平常更响的抽泣或哼叫有时促使他走到她的门口，但是逐渐地，她睡得比较沉静了；船长的守卫也没有再受到干扰。\\n\\n \\n\\n
