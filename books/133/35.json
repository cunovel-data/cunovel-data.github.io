{"id":3783,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 35","content":"The Happy Pair The dark blot on the street is gone. Mr Dombey\u0027s mansion, if it be a gap among the other houses any longer, is only so because it is not to be vied with in its brightness, and haughtily casts them off. The saying is, that home is home, be it never so homely. If it hold good in the opposite contingency, and home is home be it never so stately, what an altar to the Household Gods is raised up here! Lights are sparkling in the windows this evening, and the ruddy glow of fires is warm and bright upon the hangings and soft carpets, and the dinner waits to be served, and the dinner-table is handsomely set forth, though only for four persons, and the side board is cumbrous with plate. It is the first time that the house has been arranged for occupation since its late changes, and the happy pair are looked for every minute. Only second to the wedding morning, in the interest and expectation it engenders among the household, is this evening of the coming home. Mrs Perch is in the kitchen taking tea; and has made the tour of the establishment, and priced the silks and damasks by the yard, and exhausted every interjection in the dictionary and out of it expressive of admiration and wonder. The upholsterer\u0027s foreman, who has left his hat, with a pocket-handkerchief in it, both smelling strongly of varnish, under a chair in the hall, lurks about the house, gazing upwards at the cornices, and downward at the carpets, and occasionally, in a silent transport of enjoyment, taking a rule out of his pocket, and skirmishingly measuring expensive objects, with unutterable feelings. Cook is in high spirits, and says give her a place where there\u0027s plenty of company (as she\u0027ll bet you sixpence there will be now), for she is of a lively disposition, and she always was from a child, and she don\u0027t mind who knows it; which sentiment elicits from the breast of Mrs Perch a responsive murmur of support and approbation. All the housemaid hopes is, happiness for \u0027em - but marriage is a lottery, and the more she thinks about it, the more she feels the independence and the safety of a single life. Mr Towlinson is saturnine and grim\u0027 and says that\u0027s his opinion too, and give him War besides, and down with the French - for this young man has a general impression that every foreigner is a Frenchman, and must be by the laws of nature. At each new sound of wheels, they all stop\u003e whatever they are saying, and listen; and more than once there is a general starting up and a cry of \u0027Here they are!\u0027 But here they are not yet; and Cook begins to mourn over the dinner, which has been put back twice, and the upholsterer\u0027s foreman still goes lurking about the rooms, undisturbed in his blissful reverie! Florence is ready to receive her father and her new Mama Whether the emotions that are throbbing in her breast originate In pleasure or in pain, she hardly knows. But the fluttering heart sends added colour to her cheeks, and brightness to her eyes; and they say downstairs, drawing their heads together - for they always speak softly when they speak of her - how beautiful Miss Florence looks to-night, and what a sweet young lady she has grown, poor dear! A pause succeeds; and then Cook, feeling, as president, that her sentiments are waited for, wonders whether - and there stops. The housemaid wonders too, and so does Mrs Perch, who has the happy social faculty of always wondering when other people wonder, without being at all particular what she wonders at. Mr Towlinson, who now descries an opportunity of bringing down the spirits of the ladies to his own level, says wait and see; he wishes some people were well out of this. Cook leads a sigh then, and a murmur of \u0027Ah, it\u0027s a strange world, it is indeed!\u0027 and when it has gone round the table, adds persuasively, \u0027but Miss Florence can\u0027t well be the worse for any change, Tom.\u0027 Mr Towlinson\u0027s rejoinder, pregnant with frightful meaning, is \u0027Oh, can\u0027t she though!\u0027 and sensible that a mere man can scarcely be more prophetic, or improve upon that, he holds his peace. Mrs Skewton, prepared to greet her darling daughter and dear son-in-law with open arms, is appropriately attired for that purpose in a very youthful costume, with short sleeves. At present, however, her ripe charms are blooming in the shade of her own apartments, whence she had not emerged since she took possession of them a few hours ago, and where she is fast growing fretful, on account of the postponement of dinner. The maid who ought to be a skeleton, but is in truth a buxom damsel, is, on the other hand, In a most amiable state: considering her quarterly stipend much safer than heretofore, and foreseeing a great improvement in her board and lodging. Where are the happy pair, for whom this brave home is waiting? Do steam, tide, wind, and horses, all abate their speed, to linger on such happiness? Does the swarm of loves and graces hovering about them retard their progress by its numbers? Are there so many flowers in their happy path, that they can scarcely move along, without entanglement in thornless roses, and sweetest briar? They are here at last! The noise of wheels is heard, grows louder, and a carriage drives up to the door! A thundering knock from the obnoxious foreigner anticipates the rush of Mr Towlinson and party to open it; and Mr Dombey and his bride alight, and walk in arm in arm. \u0027My sweetest Edith!\u0027 cries an agitated voice upon the stairs. \u0027My dearest Dombey!\u0027 and the short sleeves wreath themselves about the happy couple in turn, and embrace them. Florence had come down to the hall too, but did not advance: reserving her timid welcome until these nearer and dearer transports should subside. But the eyes of Edith sought her out, upon the threshold; and dismissing her sensitive parent with a slight kiss on the cheek, she hurried on to Florence and embraced her. \u0027How do you do, Florence?\u0027 said Mr Dombey, putting out his hand. As Florence, trembling, raised it to her lips, she met his glance. The look was cold and distant enough, but it stirred her heart to think that she observed in it something more of interest than he had ever shown before. It even expressed a kind of faint surprise, and not a disagreeable surprise, at sight of her. She dared not raise her eyes to his any more; but she felt that he looked at her once again, and not less favourably. Oh what a thrill of joy shot through her, awakened by even this intangible and baseless confirmation of her hope that she would learn to win him, through her new and beautiful Mama! \u0027You will not be long dressing, Mrs Dombey, I presume?\u0027 said Mr Dombey. \u0027I shall be ready immediately.\u0027 \u0027Let them send up dinner in a quarter of an hour.\u0027 With that Mr Dombey stalked away to his own dressing-room, and Mrs Dombey went upstairs to hers. Mrs Skewton and Florence repaired to the drawing-room, where that excellent mother considered it incumbent on her to shed a few irrepressible tears, supposed to be forced from her by her daughter\u0027s felicity; and which she was still drying, very gingerly, with a laced corner of her pocket-handkerchief, when her son-in-law appeared. \u0027And how, my dearest Dombey, did you find that delightfullest of cities, Paris?\u0027 she asked, subduing her emotion. \u0027It was cold,\u0027 returned Mr Dombey. \u0027Gay as ever,\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, \u0027of course. \u0027Not particularly. I thought it dull,\u0027 said Mr Dombey. \u0027Fie, my dearest Dombey!\u0027 archly; \u0027dull!\u0027 \u0027It made that impression upon me, Madam,\u0027 said Mr Dombey, with grave politeness. \u0027I believe Mrs Dombey found it dull too. She mentioned once or twice that she thought it so.\u0027 \u0027Why, you naughty girl!\u0027 cried Mrs Skewton, rallying her dear child, who now entered, \u0027what dreadfully heretical things have you been saying about Paris?\u0027 Edith raised her eyebrows with an air of weariness; and passing the folding-doors which were thrown open to display the suite of rooms in their new and handsome garniture, and barely glancing at them as she passed, sat down by Florence. \u0027My dear Dombey,\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, \u0027how charmingly these people have carried out every idea that we hinted. They have made a perfect palace of the house, positively.\u0027 \u0027It is handsome,\u0027 said Mr Dombey, looking round. \u0027I directed that no expense should be spared; and all that money could do, has been done, I believe.\u0027 \u0027And what can it not do, dear Dombey?\u0027 observed Cleopatra. \u0027It is powerful, Madam,\u0027 said Mr Dombey. He looked in his solemn way towards his wife, but not a word said she. \u0027I hope, Mrs Dombey,\u0027 addressing her after a moment\u0027s silence, with especial distinctness; \u0027that these alterations meet with your approval?\u0027 \u0027They are as handsome as they can be,\u0027 she returned, with haughty carelessness. \u0027They should be so, of\u0027 course. And I suppose they are.\u0027 An expression of scorn was habitual to the proud face, and seemed inseparable from it; but the contempt with which it received any appeal to admiration, respect, or consideration on the ground of his riches, no matter how slight or ordinary in itself, was a new and different expression, unequalled in intensity by any other of which it was capable. Whether Mr Dombey, wrapped in his own greatness, was at all aware of this, or no, there had not been wanting opportunities already for his complete enlightenment; and at that moment it might have been effected by the one glance of the dark eye that lighted on him, after it had rapidly and scornfully surveyed the theme of his self-glorification. He might have read in that one glance that nothing that his wealth could do, though it were increased ten thousand fold, could win him for its own sake, one look of softened recognition from the defiant woman, linked to him, but arrayed with her whole soul against him. He might have read in that one glance that even for its sordid and mercenary influence upon herself, she spurned it, while she claimed its utmost power as her right, her bargain - as the base and worthless recompense for which she had become his wife. He might have read in it that, ever baring her own head for the lightning of her own contempt and pride to strike, the most innocent allusion to the power of his riches degraded her anew, sunk her deeper in her own respect, and made the blight and waste within her more complete. But dinner was announced, and Mr Dombey led down Cleopatra; Edith and his daughter following. Sweeping past the gold and silver demonstration on the sideboard as if it were heaped-up dirt, and deigning to bestow no look upon the elegancies around her, she took her place at his board for the first time, and sat, like a statue, at the feast. Mr Dombey, being a good deal in the statue way himself, was well enough pleased to see his handsome wife immovable and proud and cold. Her deportment being always elegant and graceful, this as a general behaviour was agreeable and congenial to him. Presiding, therefore, with his accustomed dignity, and not at all reflecting on his wife by any warmth or hilarity of his own, he performed his share of the honours of the table with a cool satisfaction; and the installation dinner, though not regarded downstairs as a great success, or very promising beginning, passed oil, above, in a sufficiently polite, genteel, and frosty manner. Soon after tea\u0027 Mrs Skewton, who affected to be quite overcome and worn Out by her emotions of happiness, arising in the contemplation of her dear child united to the man of her heart, but who, there is reason to suppose, found this family party somewhat dull, as she yawned for one hour continually behind her fan, retired to bed. Edith, also, silently withdrew and came back\u0027 no more. Thus, it happened that Florence, who had been upstairs to have some conversation with Diogenes, returning to the drawing-room with her little work-basket, found no one there but her father, who was walking to and fro, in dreary magnificence. \u0027I beg your pardon. Shall I go away, Papa?\u0027 said Florence faintly, hesitating at the door. \u0027No,\u0027 returned Mr Dombey, looking round over his shoulder; you can come and go here, Florence, as you please. This is not my private room. Florence entered, and sat down at a distant little table with her work: finding herself for the first time in her life - for the very first time within her memory from her infancy to that hour - alone with her father, as his companion. She, his natural companion, his only child, who in her lonely life and grief had known the suffering of a breaking heart; who, in her rejected love, had never breathed his name to God at night, but with a tearful blessing, heavier on him than a curse; who had prayed to die young, so she might only die in his arms; who had, all through, repaid the agony of slight and coldness, and dislike, with patient unexacting love, excusing him, and pleading for him, like his better angel! She trembled, and her eyes were dim. His figure seemed to grow in height and bulk before her as he paced the room: now it was all blurred and indistinct; now clear again, and plain; and now she seemed to think that this had happened, just the same, a multitude of years ago. She yearned towards him, and yet shrunk from his approach. Unnatural emotion in a child, innocent of wrong! Unnatural the hand that had directed the sharp plough, which furrowed up her gentle nature for the sowing of its seeds! Bent upon not distressing or offending him by her distress, Florence controlled herself, and sat quietly at her work. After a few more turns across and across the room, he left off pacing it; and withdrawing into a shadowy corner at some distance, where there was an easy chair, covered his head with a handkerchief, and composed himself to sleep. It was enough for Florence to sit there watching him; turning her eyes towards his chair from time to time; watching him with her thoughts, when her face was intent upon her work; and sorrowfully glad to think that he could sleep, while she was there, and that he was not made restless by her strange and long-forbidden presence. What would have been her thoughts if she had known that he was steadily regarding her; that the veil upon his face, by accident or by design, was so adjusted that his sight was free, and that itnever wandered from her face face an instant That when she looked towards him\u0027 In the obscure dark corner, her speaking eyes, more earnest and pathetic in their voiceless speech than all the orators of all the world, and impeaching him more nearly in their mute address, met his, and did not know it! That when she bent her head again over her work, he drew his breath more easily, but with the same attention looked upon her still - upon her white brow and her falling hair, and busy hands; and once attracted, seemed to have no power to turn his eyes away! And what were his thoughts meanwhile? With what emotions did he prolong the attentive gaze covertly directed on his unknown daughter? Was there reproach to him in the quiet figure and the mild eyes? Had he begun to her disregarded claims and did they touch him home at last, and waken him to some sense of his cruel injustice? There are yielding moments in the lives of the sternest and harshest men, though such men often keep their secret well. The sight ofher in her beauty, almost changed into a woman without his knowledge, may have struck out some such moments even In his life of pride. Some passing thought that he had had a happy home within his reach-had had a household spirit bending at has feet - had overlooked it in his stiffnecked sullen arrogance, and wandered away and lost himself, may have engendered them. Some simple eloquence distinctly heard, though only uttered in her eyes, unconscious that he read them\u0027 as\u0027By the death-beds I have tended, by the childhood I have suffered, by our meeting in this dreary house at midnight, by the cry wrung from me in the anguish of my heart, oh, father, turn to me and seek a refuge in my love before it is too late!\u0027 may have arrested them. Meaner and lower thoughts, as that his dead boy was now superseded by new ties, and he could forgive the having been supplanted in his affection, may have occasioned them. The mere association of her as an ornament, with all the ornament and pomp about him, may have been sufficient. But as he looked, he softened to her, more and more. As he looked, she became blended with the child he had loved, and he could hardly separate the two. As he looked, he saw her for an instant by a clearer and a brighter light, not bending over that child\u0027s pillow as his rival - monstrous thought - but as the spirit of his home, and in the action tending himself no less, as he sat once more with his bowed-down head upon his hand at the foot of the little bed. He felt inclined to speak to her, and call her to him. The words \u0027Florence, come here!\u0027 were rising to his lips - but slowly and with difficulty, they were so very strange - when they were checked and stifled by a footstep on the stair. It was his wife\u0027s. She had exchanged her dinner dress for a loose robe, and unbound her hair, which fell freely about her neck. But this was not the change in her that startled him. \u0027Florence, dear,\u0027 she said, \u0027I have been looking for you everywhere.\u0027 As she sat down by the side of Florence, she stooped and kissed her hand. He hardly knew his wife. She was so changed. It was not merely that her smile was new to him - though that he had never seen; but her manner, the tone of her voice, the light of her eyes, the interest, and confidence, and winning wish to please, expressed in all-this was not Edith. \u0027Softly, dear Mama. Papa is asleep.\u0027 It was Edith now. She looked towards the corner where he was, and he knew that face and manner very well. \u0027I scarcely thought you could be here, Florence.\u0027 Again, how altered and how softened, in an instant! \u0027I left here early,\u0027 pursued Edith, \u0027purposely to sit upstairs and talk with you. But, going to your room, I found my bird was flown, and I have been waiting there ever since, expecting its return. If it had been a bird, indeed, she could not have taken it more tenderly and gently to her breast, than she did Florence. \u0027Come, dear!\u0027 \u0027Papa will not expect to find me, I suppose, when he wakes,\u0027 hesitated Florence. \u0027Do you think he will, Florence?\u0027 said Edith, looking full upon her. Florence drooped her head, and rose, and put up her work-basket Edith drew her hand through her arm, and they went out of the room like sisters. Her very step was different and new to him\u0027 Mr Dombey thought, as his eyes followed her to the door. He sat in his shadowy corner so long, that the church clocks struck the hour three times before he moved that night. All that while his face was still intent upon the spot where Florence had been seated. The room grew darker, as the candles waned and went out; but a darkness gathered on his face, exceeding any that the night could cast, and rested there. Florence and Edith, seated before the fire in the remote room where little Paul had died, talked together for a long time. Diogenes, who was of the party, had at first objected to the admission of Edith, and, even In deference to his mistress\u0027s wish, had only permitted it under growling protest. But, emerging by little and little from the ante-room, whither he had retired in dudgeon, he soon appeared to comprehend, that with the most amiable intentions he had made one of those mistakes which will occasionally arise in the best-regulated dogs\u0027 minds; as a friendly apology for which he stuck himself up on end between the two, in a very hot place in front of the fire, and sat panting at it, with his tongue out, and a most imbecile expression of countenance, listening to the conversation. It turned, at first, on Florence\u0027s books and favourite pursuits, and on the manner in which she had beguiled the interval since the marriage. The last theme opened up to her a subject which lay very near her heart, and she said, with the tears starting to her eyes: \u0027Oh, Mama! I have had a great sorrow since that day.\u0027 \u0027You a great sorrow, Florence!\u0027 \u0027Yes. Poor Walter is drowned.\u0027 Florence spread her hands before her face, and wept with all her heart. Many as were the secret tears which Walter\u0027s fate had cost her, they flowed yet, when she thought or spoke of him. \u0027But tell me, dear,\u0027 said Edith, soothing her. \u0027Who was Walter? What was he to you?\u0027 \u0027He was my brother, Mama. After dear Paul died, we said we would be brother and sister. I had known him a long time - from a little child. He knew Paul, who liked him very much; Paul said, almost at the last, \"Take care of Walter, dear Papa! I was fond of him!\" Walter had been brought in to see him, and was there then - in this room. \u0027And did he take care of Walter?\u0027 inquired Edith, sternly. \u0027Papa? He appointed him to go abroad. He was drowned in shipwreck on his voyage,\u0027 said Florence, sobbing. \u0027Does he know that he is dead?\u0027 asked Edith. \u0027I cannot tell, Mama. I have no means of knowing. Dear Mama!\u0027 cried Florence, clinging to her as for help, and hiding her face upon her bosom, \u0027I know that you have seen - \u0027 \u0027Stay! Stop, Florence.\u0027 Edith turned so pale, and spoke so earnestly, that Florence did not need her restraining hand upon her lips. \u0027Tell me all about Walter first; let me understand this history all through.\u0027 Florence related it, and everything belonging to it, even down to the friendship of Mr Toots, of whom she could hardly speak in her distress without a tearful smile, although she was deeply grateful to him. When she had concluded her account, to the whole of which Edith, holding her hand, listened with close attention, and when a silence had succeeded, Edith said: \u0027What is it that you know I have seen, Florence?\u0027 \u0027That I am not,\u0027 said Florence, with the same mute appeal, and the same quick concealment of her face as before, \u0027that I am not a favourite child, Mama. I never have been. I have never known how to be. I have missed the way, and had no one to show it to me. Oh, let me learn from you how to become dearer to Papa Teach me! you, who can so well!\u0027 and clinging closer to her, with some broken fervent words of gratitude and endearment, Florence, relieved of her sad secret, wept long, but not as painfully as of yore, within the encircling arms of her new mother. Pale even to her lips, and with a face that strove for composure until its proud beauty was as fixed as death, Edith looked down upon the weeping girl, and once kissed her. Then gradually disengaging herself, and putting Florence away, she said, stately, and quiet as a marble image, and in a voice that deepened as she spoke, but had no other token of emotion in it: \u0027Florence, you do not know me! Heaven forbid that you should learn from me!\u0027 \u0027Not learn from you?\u0027 repeated Florence, in surprise. \u0027That I should teach you how to love, or be loved, Heaven forbid!\u0027 said Edith. \u0027If you could teach me, that were better; but it is too late. You are dear to me, Florence. I did not think that anything could ever be so dear to me, as you are in this little time.\u0027 She saw that Florence would have spoken here, so checked her with her hand, and went on. \u0027I will be your true friend always. I will cherish you, as much, if not as well as anyone in this world could. You may trust in me - I know it and I say it, dear, - with the whole confidence even of your pure heart. There are hosts of women whom he might have married, better and truer in all other respects than I am, Florence; but there is not one who could come here, his wife, whose heart could beat with greater truth to you than mine does.\u0027 \u0027I know it, dear Mama!\u0027 cried Florence. \u0027From that first most happy day I have known it.\u0027 \u0027Most happy day!\u0027 Edith seemed to repeat the words involuntarily, and went on. \u0027Though the merit is not mine, for I thought little of you until I saw you, let the undeserved reward be mine in your trust and love. And in this - in this, Florence; on the first night of my taking up my abode here; I am led on as it is best I should be, to say it for the first and last time.\u0027 Florence, without knowing why, felt almost afraid to hear her proceed, but kept her eyes riveted on the beautiful face so fixed upon her own. \u0027Never seek to find in me,\u0027 said Edith, laying her hand upon her breast, \u0027what is not here. Never if you can help it, Florence, fall off from me because it is not here. Little by little you will know me better, and the time will come when you will know me, as I know myself. Then, be as lenient to me as you can, and do not turn to bitterness the only sweet remembrance I shall have. The tears that were visible in her eyes as she kept them fixed on Florence, showed that the composed face was but as a handsome mask; but she preserved it, and continued: \u0027I have seen what you say, and know how true it is. But believe me - you will soon, if you cannot now - there is no one on this earth less qualified to set it right or help you, Florence, than I. Never ask me why, or speak to me about it or of my husband, more. There should be, so far, a division, and a silence between us two, like the grave itself.\u0027 She sat for some time silent; Florence scarcely venturing to breathe meanwhile, as dim and imperfect shadows of the truth, and all its daily consequences, chased each other through her terrified, yet incredulous imagination. Almost as soon as she had ceased to speak, Edith\u0027s face began to subside from its set composure to that quieter and more relenting aspect, which it usually wore when she and Florence were alone together. She shaded it, after this change, with her hands; and when she arose, and with an affectionate embrace bade Florence good-night, went quickly, and without looking round. But when Florence was in bed, and the room was dark except for the glow of the fire, Edith returned, and saying that she could not sleep, and that her dressing-room was lonely, drew a chair upon the hearth, and watched the embers as they died away. Florence watched them too from her bed, until they, and the noble figure before them, crowned with its flowing hair, and in its thoughtful eyes reflecting back their light, became confused and indistinct, and finally were lost in slumber. In her sleep, however, Florence could not lose an undefined impression of what had so recently passed. It formed the subject of her dreams, and haunted her; now in one shape, now in another; but always oppressively; and with a sense of fear. She dreamed of seeking her father in wildernesses, of following his track up fearful heights, and down into deep mines and caverns; of being charged with something that would release him from extraordinary suffering - she knew not what, or why - yet never being able to attain the goal and set him free. Then she saw him dead, upon that very bed, and in that very room, and knew that he had never loved her to the last, and fell upon his cold breast, passionately weeping. Then a prospect opened, and a river flowed, and a plaintive voice she knew, cried, \u0027It is running on, Floy! It has never stopped! You are moving with it!\u0027 And she saw him at a distance stretching out his arms towards her, while a figure such as Walter\u0027s used to be, stood near him, awfully serene and still. In every vision, Edith came and went, sometimes to her joy, sometimes to her sorrow, until they were alone upon the brink of a dark grave, and Edith pointing down, she looked and saw - what! - another Edith lying at the bottom. In the terror of this dream, she cried out and awoke, she thought. A soft voice seemed to whisper in her ear, \u0027Florence, dear Florence, it is nothing but a dream!\u0027 and stretching out her arms, she returned the caress of her new Mama, who then went out at the door in the light of the grey morning. In a moment, Florence sat up wondering whether this had really taken place or not; but she was only certain that it was grey morning indeed, and that the blackened ashes of the fire were on the hearth, and that she was alone. So passed the night on which the happy pair came home. 街道上的黑点已经消失了。董贝先生的公馆如果仍然是其他房屋当中的一个豁口的话，那么那只是因为它的富丽堂皇不是它们所能匹敌，它已高傲地将它们撂在一旁的缘故。谚语说得好：不管多么简陋，家总是家。如果在相反的意义上也是正确的：不管多么宏伟华贵，家总是家，那么这里给家庭之神建立的是一个什么样的圣坛啊！ 这天晚上窗子中灯光灿烂，炉火红通通的光辉温暖地、明亮地照射在帘子等各种悬挂着的物品上和柔软的地毯上；晚饭已经做好了，正等待着开出；虽然只有四人用餐，餐桌已经收拾得漂漂亮亮的，食器柜里塞满了餐具。这座公馆自从最近整修以后，这是第一次准备好迎接主人住进来，每一分钟都在等待着那幸福的伉俪光临。 主人回到家里来的这个晚上在仆人们中间所引起的关切和期待，仅仅次于举行婚礼的那天早上。珀奇太太在厨房里喝着茶，她已到这座大厦上下各处转了一圈，估量过每码丝绸和锦缎的价格，用尽了词典里和词典外所有表示赞美和惊奇的感叹词。室内装饰商的工头把他的帽子留在门厅中一张椅子的下面，帽子里放了一块手绢，帽子和手绢都散发出强烈的清漆气味；他这时在屋子里悄悄地走来走去，向上看看檐板，向下看看地毯，有时高兴得不得了，就从衣兜里取出一支尺子，用难以形容的心情侦察性地量量那些贵重的物品。厨娘兴高采烈，说她喜欢待在有许多客人来往的东家（她准备用六便士跟你打赌，说今后这里将会是这样的），因为她生性活泼快乐，从小孩子的时候起一直是这样，她也不在乎大家知道这一点；珀奇太太低声地对她表示支持与称赞，这是她出自内心的反应。女仆唯一希望的只是他们将会幸福，可是结婚就跟彩票一样，她愈是对它转着念头，她就愈觉得独身生活的独立与安全。托林森先生忧闷不乐，他说他的意见也是这样；他还希望能让他去打仗，把法国人打倒，因为在这位年轻人看来，每一个外国人都是法国人，按照自然规律，这是必然无疑的。 每当新的车轮声传来的时候，他们不论当时在说什么，全都停止说话，静静地听着；他们不止一次惊跳起来，喊道，“他们到啦！”可是他们还是没有来；厨娘开始为晚饭悲叹，因为它已经从炉子上取下又送回两次了；那位室内装饰商的工头却依旧在房间里悄悄地溜来溜去，他那极乐的幻想没有受到任何打扰！ 弗洛伦斯准备迎接她的父亲和新妈妈。她不知道，她胸中这样激动的感情是由于高兴还是由于痛苦产生的。不过跳动的心房使她的脸颊增添了血色，使她的眼睛增添了光泽。厨房里的仆人们交头接耳地说——因为他们谈到她的时候，总是很低的——，弗洛伦斯小姐今夜看去多么漂亮啊，还说可怜的孩子，她已长成一个多么可爱的姑娘了啊！接着，谈话暂时停止了；然后，厨娘觉得大家正等着她这位主席发表意见，就表示纳罕地说，莫不是——可是话说到这里就停住了。女仆也感到纳罕；珀奇太太也一样，她具有这种巧妙的社交能力：每当别人纳罕的时候，她也总是纳罕，虽然她并不清楚她究意纳罕的是什么。托林森先生看到这是把这些妇女的情绪降低到跟他一样的好机会，就说，等着瞧吧，他希望有些人在这次旅行中能平安无恙；这时厨娘带头叹了一口气，低声说道，“这是个奇怪的世界，确实是奇怪！”当全桌子的人把这句话都重复了一遍之后，她又很能说服人地补充了一句：“不过，汤姆，不管发生什么变化，对弗洛伦斯小姐总不会有害的！”托林森先生的回答充满了不祥的含意，他说：“哦，难道对她不会有害吗？”他知道，一个普通的人几乎不能比这作出更多的预言，也不能比这预言知道得更加清楚的了，所以他就保持沉默，不再说什么。 斯丘顿夫人准备伸出胳膊，热烈欢迎她心爱的女儿和亲爱的女婿回来，为了这个目的她十分适当地穿了一套很年轻的、短袖的服装。可是现在她那妖娆的风韵是在她自己的房间的阴影中放出美丽的光彩；她在几小时以前住进这个房间以后就没有出来过；由于晚餐推迟，她在房间里很快就焦躁不安起来了。她的那位侍女本应当是个骷髅，但实际上却是一位体态丰满的姑娘，她因为考虑到她每季的薪俸比过去稳靠得多，还预见到她的食宿条件将有很大改善，所以现在的态度倒是极为和蔼可亲。 这个华丽的家正在等待着的幸福的伉俪现在在哪里呢？是不是蒸汽、潮水、风和马全都减低了速度，想多观赏一下他们的幸福的情景呢？是不是成群翱翔在他们周围的爱神和美丽、温雅、欢乐三位女神①阻碍了他们的前进呢？是不是在他们幸福的路径中到处都是花朵，因此他们每向前移动一步，很难不被无刺的玫瑰或芳香的野蔷薇缠绕住呢？ -------- ①爱神指丘比德（Cupid）。美丽、温雅、欢乐三女神即阿格莱亚（Aglaia）、尤弗罗西尼（Euphrosyne）及萨拉亚（Thalia）。 他们终于来到了！车轮的声音听到了，愈来愈响了。一辆四轮马车在门前停下来了！讨厌的外国人雷鸣般地敲着门，他只比托林森先生和其他仆人急忙冲出来开门早一点点；董贝先生和他的新娘下了车，手挽着手走着。 “我最亲爱的伊迪丝！”楼梯上一个激动的喊道，“我最亲爱的董贝！”短袖依次地围绕着幸福的伉俪，并拥抱着他们。 弗洛伦斯也走下来到了门厅里，但却没有向前走去。她把她胆怯的欢迎暂时保留着，直到这些比她更亲爱更热烈的欣喜若狂的场面过去以后。可是伊迪丝在门口就认出了她；她在多情善感的母亲脸颊上轻轻地吻了一下之后，就摆脱了她，急忙向弗洛伦斯跑去，把她拥抱在怀中。 “你好，弗洛伦斯，”董贝先生伸出手，说道。 弗洛伦斯颤抖地把它举到嘴唇上的时候，碰到了他的眼光。这眼光是十分冷漠与疏远的，但是当她感到在他的眼光中流露出对她的某些关心的时候，她的心跳动了，因为这是他过去从来不曾流露过的。当他看到她的时候，他在这眼光中甚至还表露出微弱的惊奇——并不是不愉快的惊奇。她不敢再抬起眼睛来看他；但她感觉到，他并非不好感地又看了她一次。她曾经想通过她的美丽的新妈妈来赢得他，现在她又这样不可捉摸地、没有根据地肯定了这种希望。啊，尽管是这样，这希望在她全身已唤起了多么激动人心的欢乐啊！ “我想您穿衣服不需要多长的时间吧，董贝夫人？”董贝先生说道。 “我立刻就好。” “让他们在一刻钟之内开出晚饭。” 董贝先生说了这些话之后就高视阔步地走到他自己的化妆室中去，董贝夫人则上楼到她自己的化妆室中。斯丘顿夫人和弗洛伦斯向客厅走去；到了那里，这位卓越的母亲认为掉几颗控制不住的眼泪是自己义不容辞的责任，好像是因为看到女儿的幸福情不自禁地掉落的。当她还在用手绢的饰了花边的一个角小心翼翼地抹着眼泪的时候，她的女婿走进来了。 “我亲爱的董贝，你觉得巴黎这世界上最可爱有趣的城市怎么样？”她克制住自己的感情，问道。 “那里天气寒冷，”董贝先生回答道。 “一直是那么欢乐热闹吧，”斯丘顿夫人说道，“那是当然的。” “并不特别欢乐热闹。我觉得它沉闷无趣，”董贝先生说道。 “看你说的，我亲爱的董贝！沉闷无趣！”她调皮地说道。 “它给我留下了这样的印象，夫人，”董贝先生庄严地、有礼地说道，“我想，董贝夫人也觉得它沉闷无趣。她有一两次谈到这点，她认为是这样的。” “什么，你这淘气的女孩子！”斯丘顿夫人嘲笑着现在走进来的她的亲爱的孩子，喊道，“你对巴黎说了些多么可怕的、异教徒才说的话！” 伊迪丝带着厌倦的神情扬起眉毛；有一些折门现在打开了，因此显露了一套房间，里面陈列着崭新与漂亮的摆设，她走过折门的时候，只对它们看了一眼，就坐到弗洛伦斯的身旁。 “我亲爱的董贝，”斯丘顿夫人说道，“这些人多么出色地完成了我们略加指点的一切任务。确实，他们已把这座房屋完全变成一座宫殿了。” “是很漂亮，”董贝先生向四周看看，说道，“我吩咐他们不要节省任何费用；我想，凡是钱能办到的，都已办到了。” “它还有什么办不到的呢，亲爱的董贝！”克利奥佩特拉说道。 “它是很有力量的，夫人，”董贝先生说道。 他向他的妻子庄重地看了一眼，可是她却一个字也没有说。 “我希望，董贝夫人，”片刻沉默之后，他特别清楚地对她说道，“你赞成这些改变吧？” “房屋已经修缮装饰得尽可能漂亮了，”她用高傲的、冷淡的口吻说道，“当然，应当这样。我想，它们现在是这样的。” 轻蔑的表情对这张高傲的脸孔来说是习以为常的，而且似乎是和它分不开的；但是当她得到暗示，要求她对他的财富表示赞慕、尊敬或重视的时候，不论这种暗示是多么轻微，多么寻常，她对这种暗示的轻蔑是一种新的、完全不同的表情；就轻蔑的强度来说，这不是通常的轻蔑表情所能达到的。被自尊自大所蒙蔽的董贝先生不论是不是觉察到这一点，但一直来已有不少机会可以促使他恍然大悟；就在这一个时刻，当那黑眼睛的视线迅速地、轻蔑地对他引以自夸的周围陈设一扫而过之后，落在他身上的时候，它也是可以起到这个作用的。他可以从这匆匆的眼光中理解到：不论他的财富的力量多么大，它即使比现在增大一万倍，那也不能由于财富本身而从这位跟他联结在一起、但却整个心灵都在反对他的高傲的女人那里赢得一次温柔的、感激的眼光。他可以从这匆匆的眼光中理解到：正因为财富在她心中曾经引起那些肮脏的、贪图利益的计算，所以她才鄙弃它，虽然在这同时她要求得到财富所赋予的最大的权力，作为她从事一笔交易所应得到的权利，作为她成为他的妻子的一笔卑鄙的、不足取的报酬。他可以从这匆匆的眼光中理解到：虽然她已把她自己的头听凭她自己的轻蔑与傲慢的雷电去打击，但对他的财富的力量的最没有恶意的暗示，都会重新使她感到屈辱，都会使她在轻视自己的泥潭中陷得更深，都会使她在内心中受到更加彻底的摧残与损害。 但这时仆人前来通报说，晚饭已摆好了；于是董贝先生就领着克利奥佩特拉下楼去，伊迪丝和他的女儿则在后面跟着。她匆匆地走过陈列在食器柜上的金银器皿，仿佛它们是一堆垃圾似的；对于四周奢华的物品她也不屑一顾；她就这样第一次在他的餐桌上就座，像一尊雕像一样坐在筵席前面。 董贝先生本人也很像雕像，因此没有丝毫不满地看到他的漂亮的妻子一动不动、高傲地、冷淡地坐在那里。她的举止总是文雅、优美的，她的这个态度总的来说也是使他感到愉快的，符合他的心意的。因此，他就保持着他向来的尊严充当起餐桌的主人；他本人丝毫没有表现出热情或欢乐，因而也丝毫没有让他的妻子跟着他表现出热情或欢乐；他就这样冷淡地、满意地执行着主人的职责。回家后的这第一顿晚餐——虽然厨房里的仆人们并不认为是很大的成功或是大有希望的开始——就这样十分彬彬有礼、文文雅雅、毫无生气地进行完毕。 茶点用过不久，斯丘顿夫人假装由于想到她亲爱的女儿跟称心的人结婚，过于快乐兴奋，精神感到疲乏；不过我们有理由设想，她也感到这家庭晚间的聚会有些沉闷无趣，因为她整整一个小时都用扇子捂着嘴巴不断地打呵欠；所以她就离开去睡觉了。伊迪丝也悄悄地走出房间，再也没有回来。因此，当先前上楼去跟戴奥吉尼斯谈几句话的弗洛伦斯拿着她的小针线篮子回到客厅的时候，发现那里没有别人，只有她父亲在富丽堂皇、但却冷冷清清的房间中来回踱着方步。 “请原谅。我走开吗，爸爸？”弗洛伦斯迟疑不决地站在门口，轻声地问道。 “不，”董贝先生回过头来，回答道，“你可以随意到这里来，弗洛伦斯。这不是我个人专用的房间。” 弗洛伦斯走进房间，拿着针线活，坐在一张隔开较远的小桌子旁边；她发现这是她平生第一次——根据她的记忆，从她婴儿时代起直到现在，这是第一次——单独和父亲在一起，成为他的伴侣。她是他天生的伴侣和唯一的孩子；她在孤独的生活和悲伤中曾体会到一颗破碎了的心的痛苦；虽然她对他的爱曾遭受到拒绝，可是每天晚上她都含着泪水，念着他的名字向上帝祷告，祈求上帝赐福于他（对他来说，这种含着眼泪的祷告真是比咀咒还要沉重）；她曾经祈求自己在年轻的时候死去，这样可以死在他的怀抱中；她始终如一地用耐性的、不抱奢望的爱来报答他那令人痛苦的轻视、冷淡和嫌恶，并像他的守护神一样宽恕他和为他辩护！ 她颤抖着，眼睛模糊了。当他在房间里踱步的时候，他的身形在她眼前似乎高起来了，大起来了；一会儿它是模糊不清的，一会儿它又清楚鲜明了，一会儿她仿佛觉得这种情形好多年以前就像现在一样发生过。她向往他，可是当他走近的时候却又向后退缩。这是一个不知道邪恶的孩子的不自然的感情啊！一只奇怪的手在指导着锐利的犁，在她温柔的心田中耕出垅沟，来播种这种感情的种籽！ 弗洛伦斯决心不让自己的悲痛来使他伤心或生气，所以她控制着自己，安安静静地坐在那里，干着针线活。他在房间里又转了几圈之后，不再踱步，而是到隔着一定距离的一个阴暗的角落里，在一张安乐椅中坐下，用手绢蒙着头，安下心来睡觉。 弗洛伦斯坐在那里看守着他，不时把眼睛朝他的椅子那边看看；她的脸孔专心致志地对着她的针线活，但她的思想却在注意着他；她又忧郁又高兴地想到，他能够在她身旁睡去，他并没有因为她奇怪地在场而坐立不安，而在过去，长期以来，他是绝不允许她在场的。对弗洛伦斯来说这样已经足够了！ 他一直在不停地注意着她；他脸上的手绢无意或有意地摆放得使他可以随意地看她；他的视线一秒钟也没有离开过她的脸孔！当她朝着黑暗的角落里向他望过去的时候，她那富于表情的眼睛在无声的语言中比世界上所有的演说家说得更为恳切、更使人感动，它们在缄默的陈诉中向他提出了比语言更为严肃的责备；就在这时候，她的眼光碰到了他的眼光，可是她却不知道！当她重新低下头去干活的时候，他呼吸得舒畅了一些，但却继续同样注意地看着她——看着她那洁白的前额、垂落的头发和忙碌的双手——，而且一旦被她吸引住了，好像就再也没有力量能把他的眼睛移开似的！啊，如果她知道这一切的话，她该会怎么想啊！ 这时候他又在想些什么呢？他怀着什么样的情绪在继续暗暗地注视着她的一无所知的女儿呢？他是不是在她安静的身姿与温柔的眼睛中看到了对他的责备了呢？他是不是已经开始认识到她应当得到但却被他忽视了的权利了呢？是不是它们终于打动了他的心，使他猛醒过来，认识到自己过去残酷的不公道了呢？ 最严厉、最冷酷的人们虽然时常把他们内心的秘密保守得严严实实的，但在他们的生活中也有柔顺下来的片刻。看到女儿姿容美丽，在他不知不觉之中已经几乎变成一位成年妇女，这也许甚至在他的高傲的生活中也能引来这样柔顺的片刻吧！他身边已经有了一个幸福的家，家庭幸福的守护神正俯伏在他的脚旁，而他过去却顽固不化，绷着脸孔，妄自尊大，没有注意到这个守护神从旁走开，并断送了自己——也许，在脑中闪现的这样一些想法也能使他产生出这样柔顺的片刻吧！虽然她仅仅用眼睛表露，也不知道他已经看出，但他却像清清楚楚地听到她在娓娓动听地向他诉说着纯朴的话语：“啊，爸爸，看在我曾在床边照料过的死去的弟弟的分上，看在我曾度过的苦难的童年的分上，看在我们在深更半夜在这凄凉的房屋中相会的分上，看在我出于内心痛苦所发出的哀哭的分上，请转向我，在我对你的爱中寻求庇护吧，别等到太晚了！”——也许这些话也能激发他进入这样柔顺的片刻吧！还有一些比较卑劣、比较低贱的思想（如他死去的孩子现在已经被新婚所代替，因此他可以原谅曾经取代了他的爱的这个人了），也许也可以促使他产生这样柔顺的片刻吧！甚至就是这样的思想：她可以当作一项装饰品，和他周围所有其他的装饰品与奢侈品一起存在——也许这也足够使他心肠柔顺下来了。可是他愈看她，他对她就愈来愈温柔。当他看着她的时候，她跟他曾心爱过的男孩融合在一起了，他简直不能把他们两人分开。当他看着她的时候，他在片刻间通过更清晰、更明亮的光线看到了她，不再把她看作曾经俯伏在他男孩子的枕头上的他的竞敌（这是多么离奇的思想哟！），而是把她看作他家庭的守护神了，她正在看护着他，正像她过去曾经看护小保罗时的情形一样。他觉得他想跟她谈谈，把她叫到自己身边来。“弗洛伦斯，到这里来吧！”这些话已经到了他的嘴边——不过是缓慢、费劲的，因为他很不习惯这么说——，这时楼梯上响起了脚步声，这些话就被抑制住，说不出来了。 这是他妻子的脚步声。她已经脱去吃晚饭时的服装，换上了一件宽大的长衣，并已松开头发，让它随意地披垂在脖子周围。但是使他吃惊的并不是她的这些改变。 “弗洛伦斯，亲爱的，”她说道，“我一直在到处找你。” 当她坐在弗洛伦斯身旁的时候，她弯下身子，吻了吻她的手。他简直认不出这是他的妻子。她的变化是这么大。不仅她的微笑对他来说是新奇的（虽然他过去从没有见到她微笑），而且她处处表现出来的神态、声调、眼光、关切、信任以及那想使人高兴的愿望，也全都是新奇的。这不是伊迪丝。 “轻一点，亲爱的妈妈。爸爸睡着了。” 现在，这又是伊迪丝了。她朝他所在的角落里望过去，那脸孔和神态是他十分熟悉的。 “我完全没想到你会在这里，弗洛伦斯。” 她在一刹那间又换了个人，变得十分温柔。 “我很早就离开这里，”伊迪丝继续说道，“我想在楼上坐着，跟你谈话。可是我到了你的房间里，发现我的小鸟飞走啦，我就一直坐在那里等待着，盼望小鸟飞回来。” 如果这真是一只小鸟的话，那么她也不能比她现在对弗洛伦斯那样更亲切、更温柔地把它搂在她胸前了。 “走吧，亲爱的！” “爸爸醒来的时候发现我走了，不会觉得奇怪吧？”弗洛伦斯迟疑地说道。 “你想他会吗，弗洛伦斯？”伊迪丝注视着她的脸孔，说道。 弗洛伦斯低下头，站起来，拿起针线篮子。伊迪丝挽着她的手，她们像姐妹俩似地走出了房间。她的每一个步伐对他来说，都是与往常不同的，是他所不熟悉的。当董贝先生目送她到门口时，他这样想。 那天夜晚，他在他那阴暗的角落里坐了很久，直到教堂里的时钟敲打了三下，他才开始走动。他的眼睛一直继续注视着弗洛伦斯坐过的地方。当蜡烛逐渐燃尽和熄灭的时候，房间里更加黑暗了；可是在他的脸上凝集着一层阴影，比任何深夜投下的阴影都更黑暗，而且一直停留在他的脸上。 弗洛伦斯和伊迪丝坐在小保罗死去的那间偏僻的房间里的壁炉前，长时间地交谈。戴奥吉尼斯也跟她们在一起；它最初反对伊迪丝进去，后来虽然尊重他女主人的愿望，但也还是在表示抗议的吠叫之下才勉强同意的。可是它怒气冲冲地跑到接待室中去休息之后不久，就悄悄地爬了出来，好像它已明白：虽然它用心很好，但却犯了一个错误，这是那些受过最好训练的狗有时也难免会犯的错误。为了友好地表示歉意，它就直挺挺地坐在她们两人中间、壁炉前面一个很热的地方，伸出舌头，露出一副傻里傻气的嘴脸，对着炉火，喘着气，并听着她们谈话。 谈话最初涉及弗洛伦斯的书本和她所喜爱研究的问题，也谈到结婚那天以来她是怎么消磨掉这段时间的。这最后的话题引起她谈到一个藏在她内心的问题。她涌出眼泪，说道：“啊，妈妈！从那天以来我一直沉陷在极大的悲痛之中。” “你——极大的悲痛，弗洛伦斯！” “是的，可怜的沃尔特淹死了。” 弗洛伦斯两只手捂着脸，尽情地痛哭着。沃尔特的命运曾使她暗暗地流过许多眼泪，可是每当想到他或谈到他的时候，泪水却仍然汪汪地涌出。 “不过请告诉我，亲爱的，”伊迪丝安慰着她，说道，“沃尔特是谁？他是你的什么人？” “他是我的哥哥，妈妈。亲爱的保罗死了以后，我们相互约定，结为兄妹。我认识他很久了。他认识保罗，保罗非常喜欢他；保罗临终的时候还说，‘请关怀沃尔特吧，亲爱的爸爸！我喜欢他！’当时爸爸曾经派人把沃尔特领进来看他，就在这里——在这个房间里。” “他真的关怀沃尔特了吗？”伊迪丝严厉地问道。 “你是说爸爸吗？他派他到国外去。他在航行中由于船失事而淹死了。” “你知道他死了吗？”伊迪丝问道。 “我不知道，妈妈，我没法子知道。亲爱的妈妈！”弗洛伦斯哭道，一边紧贴着她，好像哀求她帮助似的，同时把脸掩藏在她胸前，“我知道，你已经看到——” “等一等！别说，弗洛伦斯！”伊迪丝脸色变得十分苍白，话又说得十分恳切，所以弗洛伦斯不待她用手捂住她的嘴巴，就没有再说下去了，“首先告诉我沃尔特的一切情形；让我从头到尾了解这全部历史。” 弗洛伦斯叙述了这历史以及有关的一切细节，甚至一直说到图茨先生的友谊；在提到图茨先生的时候，她尽管悲痛，却还是不能不含着泪水微笑着，虽然她对他是深深感激的。伊迪丝握着她的手，非常留心地听着她所说的一切；当她说完，接着又沉默了一会儿之后，伊迪丝问道： “你知道我已经看到了什么，弗洛伦斯？” “我不是，”弗洛伦斯用同样默默无声的哀求，并像先前一样迅速地把脸掩藏到她胸前，说道，“我不是我爸爸所宠爱的女儿，妈妈。我从来也不是。我从来不知道怎样才能是。我迷失了道路，可是没有一个人向我指点道路。啊，让我向你学习怎样能跟爸爸亲近一些。教教我吧！你是十分懂得的！”弗洛伦斯向她贴得更近了一些，断断续续地用充满了感激和亲爱的热烈语言，吐露了她伤心的秘密之后，长时间地哭泣着，不过在她新妈妈的怀抱之中不像过去那么悲痛了。 伊迪丝甚至连嘴唇也发白了，脸孔做着劲，力求镇静，直到她那高傲的美貌像死去一般完全不动为止；她向下看着哭泣的女孩子，吻了她一次。然后她逐渐从弗洛伦斯的怀抱中抽出身来，把弗洛伦斯推开一些，这时候，她庄严地，像大理石雕像一样平静地，用愈加深沉、但却没有露出其他激动迹象的，说道： “弗洛伦斯，你不了解我！你说什么要向我学习，这是老天爷所不容许的！” “不向你学习？”弗洛伦斯惊奇地重复着说道。 “你说什么我要教你怎样去爱，或者怎样成为受宠爱的人，这是老天爷所不容许的！”伊迪丝说道，“如果你能教我的话，那倒更好一些；可是已经太晚了。你是我所喜爱的人，弗洛伦斯。我想不起有谁能像你这样，在这么短短的时间里叫我这么喜爱的。” 她看到弗洛伦斯这时想没什么，就做了个手势，阻止她，继续说下去： “我将一直是你忠实的朋友。我将尽量爱护你，即使不像别人那么爱护得好。你可以相信我——我知道这，亲爱的，我也这么说——，你可以用你纯洁心灵的全部真诚相信我。他可以跟许许多多女人结婚，她们在其他方面比我更好，更忠心，弗洛伦斯；但是能到这里来当他妻子的人，谁的心也不能像我这样真诚地对待你。” “我知道，亲爱的妈妈！”弗洛伦斯喊道，“从那最幸福的一天起，我就知道了。” “最幸福的一天！”伊迪丝似乎无意识地重复了这几个字之后，继续说下去。“虽然这并不是我的功劳，因为我在见到你以前，很少想到你，可是就让你的信任和爱作为我无功而得的奖赏吧。你的信任和爱，弗洛伦斯。在我住到这里来的第一个晚上，我想跟你谈谈这一点（这样是最好的），这是第一次，也是最后一次。” 弗洛伦斯不知道为什么，感到几乎害怕听她说下去，但却把眼睛一动不动地盯着那张凝视着她的美丽的脸孔。 “千万别想从我这里寻找那不存在的东西。”伊迪丝把手搁在胸脯上，说道，“如果你可能的话，千万别因为我这里没有你所想要找到的东西就离开我。你会慢慢地、更好地了解我的。总有一天，你会像我了解我自己一样地了解我。那时候，请尽可能对我宽厚吧，并且别把我将拥有的唯一甜蜜的回忆变为苦味的东西吧。” 当她一动不动地注视着弗洛伦斯的时候，可以在她的眼睛中看到泪水，这说明：那镇静的脸孔只不过是一个漂亮的假面具而已；可是她却依旧戴着它，继续说下去： “我已经看到了你所说的情形，而且知道你说得多么真实。可是，请相信我——如果你现在不能相信的话，那么你很快就会相信的——，世界上没有任何人比我更没有能力来改正或帮助你，弗洛伦斯。千万别问我为什么这样，也不要再跟我谈到这或谈到我的丈夫。这应当成为我们之间不可跨越的鸿沟，让我们两人对它保持着坟墓般的沉默。” 她沉默地坐了一些时候，弗洛伦斯几乎不敢呼吸，因为事实真相的模糊不清、支离破碎的影子以及它的日常后果，正在她恐惧的、但仍然怀疑的想象之中一个接一个地出现。伊迪丝几乎停止说话，她的脸孔就立刻从她故作镇静之中回复到平时她单独跟弗洛伦斯在一起时那种比较平静、比较温和的神态。在发生了这种变化之后，她用手捂着脸孔；当她站起来，感情深厚地拥抱了弗洛伦斯，祝她晚安之后，她快步走了出去，没有再回过头来。 可是当弗洛伦斯躺在床上，房间里除了壁炉发出的火光之外，已经一片黑暗的时候，伊迪丝回来了，说她睡不着，在她的化妆室里感到寂寞；她把一张椅子移近壁炉，望着余烬逐渐熄灭。弗洛伦斯也从床上望着余烬，直到后来，这些余烬和余烬前面的高贵的人影儿（它飘垂着长发，若有所思的眼睛反射出即将熄灭的火光）变得模糊纷乱，最后消失在她的睡眠之中。 可是，新近发生的事情的模糊印象，弗洛伦斯就是在睡眠中也还不能排除。它构成她的梦景，紧缠着她：一会儿是这个形状，一会儿是另一个形状，但总是沉闷地压着她，使她感到恐惧。她梦见在旷野中寻找父亲，跟随着他的足迹，往上攀登险峻的高峰，往下步入纵深的矿井和岩洞；她负着某种使命，要把他从异乎寻常的苦难中解救出来——她不知道究竟是什么苦难，也不知道为什么发生这样的苦难——，可是她从来不能达到目的，使他获得自由；然后她看到他就在这个房间里，就在这张床上死去了；她知道他始终没有爱过她，就扑在他冷冰冰的胸脯上悲痛地大哭着。接着，展现出一幅远景：一条河流流过去，一个她所熟悉的悲哀的喊道，“它向前流着呢，弗洛伊！它永远也不停止！你正随着它一道前进呢！”她看到他站在远处向她伸出胳膊，一个像沃尔特的人和他并排站在一起，安详、沉静得令人可怕。在每一个梦景中，伊迪丝出现了，又消失了，有时给她带来欢乐，有时给她带来悲伤，最后她们两人站在一个黑暗的坟墓的边缘上，伊迪丝指向下面，她望过去，看见了——谁呀！——另一个伊迪丝正躺在底下。 她在这个恶梦的惊恐中大声喊叫着，并醒来了。一个温柔的似乎在她耳边低声说道，“弗洛伦斯，亲爱的弗洛伦斯，这只是个梦！”她伸出胳膊，回答她新妈妈的爱抚；然后，她的新妈妈在阴沉的晨光中从房间中走出去了。弗洛伦斯忽然间坐了起来，心中纳闷：这究竟是不是真正发生过的事情？但她只能肯定的是，这的确是个阴沉的早晨，黑色的灰烬留在壁炉地面上，房间中就只有她孤零零的一个人。 幸福的伉俪回到家来的这一夜，就这样过去了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/329/8539.html","bookId":133,"book":{"id":133,"title":"董贝父子 Dombey and Son","description":"简介：
