{"id":3778,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"The interval before the Marriage\n Although the enchanted house was no more, and the working world had broken into it, and was hammering and crashing and tramping up and down stairs all day long keeping Diogenes in an incessant paroxysm of barking, from sunrise to sunset - evidently convinced that his enemy had got the better of him at last, and was then sacking the premises in triumphant defiance - there was, at first, no other great change in the method of Florence\u0027s life. At night, when the workpeople went away, the house was dreary and deserted again; and Florence, listening to their voices echoing through the hall and staircase as they departed, pictured to herself the cheerful homes to which the were returning, and the children who were waiting for them, and was glad to think that they were merry and well pleased to go.\n She welcomed back the evening silence as an old friend, but it came now with an altered face, and looked more kindly on her. Fresh hope was in it. The beautiful lady who had soothed and carressed her, in the very room in which her heart had been so wrung, was a spirit of promise to her. Soft shadows of the bright life dawning, when her father\u0027s affection should be gradually won, and all, or much should be restored, of what she had lost on the dark day when a mother\u0027s love had faded with a mother\u0027s last breath on her cheek, moved about her in the twilight and were welcome company. Peeping at the rosy children her neighbours, it was a new and precious sensation to think that they might soon speak together and know each other; when she would not fear, as of old, to show herself before them, lest they should be grieved to see her in her black dress sitting there alone!\n In her thoughts of her new mother, and in the love and trust overflowing her pure heart towards her, Florence loved her own dead mother more and more. She had no fear of setting up a rival in her breast. The new flower sprang from the deep-planted and long-cherished root, she knew. Every gentle word that had fallen from the lips of the beautiful lady, sounded to Florence like an echo of the voice long hushed and silent. How could she love that memory less for living tenderness, when it was her memory of all parental tenderness and love!\n Florence was, one day, sitting reading in her room, and thinking of the lady and her promised visit soon - for her book turned on a kindred subject - when, raising her eyes, she saw her standing in the doorway.\n \u0027Mama!\u0027 cried Florence, joyfully meeting her. \u0027Come again!\u0027\n \u0027Not Mama yet,\u0027 returned the lady, with a serious smile, as she encircled Florence\u0027s neck with her arm.\n \u0027But very soon to be,\u0027 cried Florence.\n \u0027Very soon now, Florence: very soon.\n Edith bent her head a little, so as to press the blooming cheek of Florence against her own, and for some few moments remained thus silent. There was something so very tender in her manner, that Florence was even more sensible of it than on the first occasion of their meeting.\n She led Florence to a chair beside her, and sat down: Florence looking in her face, quite wondering at its beauty, and willingly leaving her hand In hers.\n \u0027Have you been alone, Florence, since I was here last?\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes!\u0027 smiled Florence, hastily.\n She hesitated and cast down her eyes; for her new Mama was very earnest in her look, and the look was intently and thoughtfully fixed upon her face.\n \u0027I - I- am used to be alone,\u0027 said Florence. \u0027I don\u0027t mind it at all. Di and I pass whole days together, sometimes.\u0027 Florence might have said, whole weeks and months.\n \u0027Is Di your maid, love?\u0027\n \u0027My dog, Mama,\u0027 said Florence, laughing. \u0027Susan is my maid.\u0027\n \u0027And these are your rooms,\u0027 said Edith, looking round. \u0027I was not shown these rooms the other day. We must have them improved, Florence. They shall be made the prettiest in the house.\u0027\n \u0027If I might change them, Mama,\u0027 returned Florence; \u0027there is one upstairs I should like much better.\u0027\n \u0027Is this not high enough, dear girl?\u0027 asked Edith, smiling.\n \u0027The other was my brother\u0027s room,\u0027 said Florence, \u0027and I am very fond of it. I would have spoken to Papa about it when I came home, and found the workmen here, and everything changing; but - \u0027\n Florence dropped her eyes, lest the same look should make her falter again.\n \u0027but I was afraid it might distress him; and as you said you would be here again soon, Mama, and are the mistress of everything, I determined to take courage and ask you.\u0027\n Edith sat looking at her, with her brilliant eyes intent upon her face, until Florence raising her own, she, in her turn, withdrew her gaze, and turned it on the ground. It was then that Florence thought how different this lady\u0027s beauty was, from what she had supposed. She had thought it of a proud and lofty kind; yet her manner was so subdued and gentle, that if she had been of Florence\u0027s own age and character, it scarcely could have invited confidence more.\n Except when a constrained and singular reserve crept over her; and then she seemed (but Florence hardly understood this, though she could not choose but notice it, and think about it) as if she were humbled before Florence, and ill at ease. When she had said that she was not her Mama yet, and when Florence had called her the mistress of everything there, this change in her was quick and startling; and now, while the eyes of Florence rested on her face, she sat as though she would have shrunk and hidden from her, rather than as one about to love and cherish her, in right of such a near connexion.\n She gave Florence her ready promise, about her new room, and said she would give directions about it herself. She then asked some questions concerning poor Paul; and when they had sat in conversation for some time, told Florence she had come to take her to her own home.\n \u0027We have come to London now, my mother and I,\u0027 said Edith, \u0027and you shall stay with us until I am married. I wish that we should know and trust each other, Florence.\u0027\n \u0027You are very kind to me,\u0027 said Florence, \u0027dear Mama. How much I thank you!\u0027\n \u0027Let me say now, for it may be the best opportunity,\u0027 continued Edith, looking round to see that they were quite alone, and speaking in a lower voice, \u0027that when I am married, and have gone away for some weeks, I shall be easier at heart if you will come home here. No matter who invites you to stay elsewhere. Come home here. It is better to be alone than - what I would say is,\u0027 she added, checking herself, \u0027that I know well you are best at home, dear Florence.\u0027\n \u0027I will come home on the very day, Mama\u0027\n \u0027Do so. I rely on that promise. Now, prepare to come with me, dear girl. You will find me downstairs when you are ready.\u0027\n Slowly and thoughtfully did Edith wander alone through the mansion of which she was so soon to be the lady: and little heed took she of all the elegance and splendour it began to display. The same indomitable haughtiness of soul, the same proud scorn expressed in eye and lip, the same fierce beauty, only tamed by a sense of its own little worth, and of the little worth of everything around it, went through the grand saloons and halls, that had got loose among the shady trees, and raged and rent themselves. The mimic roses on the walls and floors were set round with sharp thorns, that tore her breast; in every scrap of gold so dazzling to the eye, she saw some hateful atom of her purchase-money; the broad high mirrors showed her, at full length, a woman with a noble quality yet dwelling in her nature, who was too false to her better self, and too debased and lost, to save herself. She believed that all this was so plain, more or less, to all eyes, that she had no resource or power of self-assertion but in pride: and with this pride, which tortured her own heart night and day, she fought her fate out, braved it, and defied it.\n Was this the woman whom Florence - an innocent girl, strong only in her earnestness and simple truth - could so impress and quell, that by her side she was another creature, with her tempest of passion hushed, and her very pride itself subdued? Was this the woman who now sat beside her in a carriage, with her arms entwined, and who, while she courted and entreated her to love and trust her, drew her fair head to nestle on her breast, and would have laid down life to shield it from wrong or harm?\n Oh, Edith! it were well to die, indeed, at such a time! Better and happier far, perhaps, to die so, Edith, than to live on to the end!\n The Honourable Mrs Skewton, who was thinking of anything rather than of such sentiments - for, like many genteel persons who have existed at various times, she set her face against death altogether, and objected to the mention of any such low and levelling upstart - had borrowed a house in Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, from a stately relative (one of the Feenix brood), who was out of town, and who did not object to lending it, in the handsomest manner, for nuptial purposes, as the loan implied his final release and acquittance from all further loans and gifts to Mrs Skewton and her daughter. It being necessary for the credit of the family to make a handsome appearance at such a time, Mrs Skewton, with the assistance of an accommodating tradesman resident In the parish of Mary-le-bone, who lent out all sorts of articles to the nobility and gentry, from a service of plate to an army of footmen, clapped into this house a silver-headed butler (who was charged extra on that account, as having the appearnce of an ancient family retainer), two very tall young men in livery, and a select staff of kitchen-servants; so that a legend arose, downstairs, that Withers the page, released at once from his numerous household duties, and from the propulsion of the wheeled-chair (inconsistent with the metropolis), had been several times observed to rub his eyes and pinch his limbs, as if he misdoubted his having overslept himself at the Leamington milkman\u0027s, and being still in a celestial dream. A variety of requisites in plate and china being also conveyed to the same establishment from the same convenient source, with several miscellaneous articles, including a neat chariot and a pair of bays, Mrs Skewton cushioned herself on the principal sofa, in the Cleopatra attitude, and held her court in fair state.\n \u0027And how,\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, on the entrance of her daughter and her charge, \u0027is my charming Florence? You must come and kiss me, Florence, if you please, my love.\u0027\n Florence was timidly stooping to pick out a place In the white part of Mrs Skewton\u0027s face, when that lady presented her ear, and relieved her of her difficulty.\n \u0027Edith, my dear,\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, \u0027positively, I - stand a little more in the light, my sweetest Florence, for a moment.\n Florence blushingly complied.\n \u0027You don\u0027t remember, dearest Edith,\u0027 said her mother, \u0027what you were when you were about the same age as our exceedingly precious Florence, or a few years younger?\u0027\n \u0027I have long forgotten, mother.\u0027\n \u0027For positively, my dear,\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, \u0027I do think that I see a decided resemblance to what you were then, in our extremely fascinating young friend. And it shows,\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, in a lower voice, which conveyed her opinion that Florence was in a very unfinished state, \u0027what cultivation will do.\u0027\n \u0027It does, indeed,\u0027 was Edith\u0027s stern reply.\n Her mother eyed her sharply for a moment, and feeling herself on unsafe ground, said, as a diversion:\n \u0027My charming Florence, you must come and kiss me once more, if you please, my love.\u0027\n Florence complied, of course, and again imprinted her lips on Mrs Skewton\u0027s ear.\n \u0027And you have heard, no doubt, my darling pet,\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, detaining her hand, \u0027that your Papa, whom we all perfectly adore and dote upon, is to be married to my dearest Edith this day week.\u0027\n \u0027I knew it would be very soon,\u0027 returned Florence, \u0027but not exactly when.\u0027\n \u0027My darling Edith,\u0027 urged her mother, gaily, \u0027is it possible you have not told Florence?\u0027\n \u0027Why should I tell Florence?\u0027 she returned, so suddenly and harshly, that Florence could scarcely believe it was the same voice.\n Mrs Skewton then told Florence, as another and safer diversion, that her father was coming to dinner, and that he would no doubt be charmingly surprised to see her; as he had spoken last night of dressing in the City, and had known nothing of Edith\u0027s design, the execution of which, according to Mrs Skewton\u0027s expectation, would throw him into a perfect ecstasy. Florence was troubled to hear this; and her distress became so keen, as the dinner-hour approached, that if she had known how to frame an entreaty to be suffered to return home, without involving her father in her explanation, she would have hurried back on foot, bareheaded, breathless, and alone, rather than incur the risk of meeting his displeasure.\n As the time drew nearer, she could hardly breathe. She dared not approach a window, lest he should see her from the street. She dared not go upstairs to hide her emotion, lest, in passing out at the door, she should meet him unexpectedly; besides which dread, she felt as though she never could come back again if she were summoned to his presence. In this conflict of fears; she was sitting by Cleopatra\u0027s couch, endeavouring to understand and to reply to the bald discourse of that lady, when she heard his foot upon the stair.\n \u0027I hear him now!\u0027 cried Florence, starting. \u0027He is coming!\u0027\n Cleopatra, who in her juvenility was always playfully disposed, and who in her self-engrossment did not trouble herself about the nature of this agitation, pushed Florence behind her couch, and dropped a shawl over her, preparatory to giving Mr Dombey a rapture of surprise. It was so quickly done, that in a moment Florence heard his awful step in the room.\n He saluted his intended mother-in-law, and his intended bride. The strange sound of his voice thrilled through the whole frame of his child.\n \u0027My dear Dombey,\u0027 said Cleopatra, \u0027come here and tell me how your pretty Florence is.\u0027\n \u0027Florence is very well,\u0027 said Mr Dombey, advancing towards the couch.\n \u0027At home?\u0027\n \u0027At home,\u0027 said Mr Dombey.\n \u0027My dear Dombey,\u0027 returned Cleopatra, with bewitching vivacity; \u0027now are you sure you are not deceiving me? I don\u0027t know what my dearest Edith will say to me when I make such a declaration, but upon my honour I am afraid you are the falsest of men, my dear Dombey.\u0027\n Though he had been; and had been detected on the spot, in the most enormous falsehood that was ever said or done; he could hardly have been more disconcerted than he was, when Mrs Skewton plucked the shawl away, and Florence, pale and trembling, rose before him like a ghost. He had not yet recovered his presence of mind, when Florence had run up to him, clasped her hands round his neck, kissed his face, and hurried out of the room. He looked round as if to refer the matter to somebody else, but Edith had gone after Florence, instantly.\n \u0027Now, confess, my dear Dombey,\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, giving him her hand, \u0027that you never were more surprised and pleased in your life.\u0027\n \u0027I never was more surprised,\u0027 said Mr Dombey.\n \u0027Nor pleased, my dearest Dombey?\u0027 returned Mrs Skewton, holding up her fan.\n \u0027I - yes, I am exceedingly glad to meet Florence here,\u0027 said Mr Dombey. He appeared to consider gravely about it for a moment, and then said, more decidedly, \u0027Yes, I really am very glad indeed to meet Florence here.\u0027\n \u0027You wonder how she comes here?\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, \u0027don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Edith, perhaps - \u0027 suggested Mr Dombey.\n \u0027Ah! wicked guesser!\u0027 replied Cleopatra, shaking her head. \u0027Ah! cunning, cunning man! One shouldn\u0027t tell these things; your sex, my dear Dombey, are so vain, and so apt to abuse our weakness; but you know my open soul - very well; immediately.\u0027\n This was addressed to one of the very tall young men who announced dinner.\n \u0027But Edith, my dear Dombey,\u0027 she continued in a whisper, when she cannot have you near her - and as I tell her, she cannot expect that always - will at least have near her something or somebody belonging to you. Well, how extremely natural that is! And in this spirit, nothing would keep her from riding off to-day to fetch our darling Florence. Well, how excessively charming that is!\u0027\n As she waited for an answer, Mr Dombey answered, \u0027Eminently so.\n \u0027Bless you, my dear Dombey, for that proof of heart!\u0027 cried Cleopatra, squeezing his hand. \u0027But I am growing too serious! Take me downstairs, like an angel, and let us see what these people intend to give us for dinner. Bless you, dear Dombey!\u0027\n Cleopatra skipping off her couch with tolerable briskness, after the last benediction, Mr Dombey took her arm in his and led her ceremoniously downstairs; one of the very tall young men on hire, whose organ of veneration was imperfectly developed, thrusting his tongue into his cheek, for the entertainment of the other very tall young man on hire, as the couple turned into the dining-room.\n Florence and Edith were already there, and sitting side by side. Florence would have risen when her father entered, to resign her chair to him; but Edith openly put her hand upon her arm, and Mr Dombey took an opposite place at the round table.\n The conversation was almost entirely sustained by Mrs Skewton. Florence hardly dared to raise her eyes, lest they should reveal the traces of tears; far less dared to speak; and Edith never uttered one word, unless in answer to a question. Verily, Cleopatra worked hard, for the establishment that was so nearly clutched; and verily it should have been a rich one to reward her!\n And so your preparations are nearly finished at last, my dear Dombey?\u0027 said Cleopatra, when the dessert was put upon the table, and the silver-headed butler had withdrawn. \u0027Even the lawyers\u0027 preparations!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, madam,\u0027 replied Mr Dombey; \u0027the deed of settlement, the professional gentlemen inform me, is now ready, and as I was mentioning to you, Edith has only to do us the favour to suggest her own time for its execution.\u0027\n Edith sat like a handsome statue; as cold, as silent, and as still.\n \u0027My dearest love,\u0027 said Cleopatra, \u0027do you hear what Mr Dombey says? Ah, my dear Dombey!\u0027 aside to that gentleman, \u0027how her absence, as the time approaches, reminds me of the days, when that most agreeable of creatures, her Papa, was in your situation!\u0027\n \u0027I have nothing to suggest. It shall be when you please,\u0027 said Edith, scarcely looking over the table at Mr Dombey.\n \u0027To-morrow?\u0027 suggested Mr Dombey.\n \u0027If you please.\u0027\n \u0027Or would next day,\u0027 said Mr Dombey, \u0027suit your engagements better?\u0027\n \u0027I have no engagements. I am always at your disposal. Let it be when you like.\u0027\n \u0027No engagements, my dear Edith!\u0027 remonstrated her mother, \u0027when you are in a most terrible state of flurry all day long, and have a thousand and one appointments with all sorts of trades-people!\u0027\n \u0027They are of your making,\u0027 returned Edith, turning on her with a slight contraction of her brow. \u0027You and Mr Dombey can arrange between you.\u0027\n \u0027Very true indeed, my love, and most considerate of you!\u0027 said Cleopatra. \u0027My darling Florence, you must really come and kiss me once more, if you please, my dear!\u0027\n Singular coincidence, that these gushes of interest In Florence hurried Cleopatra away from almost every dialogue in which Edith had a share, however trifling! Florence had certainly never undergone so much embracing, and perhaps had never been, unconsciously, so useful in her life.\n Mr Dombey was far from quarrelling, in his own breast, with the manner of his beautiful betrothed. He had that good reason for sympathy with haughtiness and coldness, which is found In a fellow-feeling. It flattered him to think how these deferred to him, in Edith\u0027s case, and seemed to have no will apart from his. It flattered him to picture to himself, this proud and stately woman doing the honours of his house, and chilling his guests after his own manner. The dignity of Dombey and Son would be heightened and maintained, indeed, in such hands.\n So thought Mr Dombey, when he was left alone at the dining-table, and mused upon his past and future fortunes: finding no uncongeniality in an air of scant and gloomy state that pervaded the room, in colour a dark brown, with black hatchments of pictures blotching the walls, and twenty-four black chairs, with almost as many nails in them as so many coffins, waiting like mutes, upon the threshold of the Turkey carpet; and two exhausted negroes holding up two withered branches of candelabra on the sideboard, and a musty smell prevailing as if the ashes of ten thousand dinners were entombed in the sarcophagus below it. The owner of the house lived much abroad; the air of England seldom agreed long with a member of the Feenix family; and the room had gradually put itself into deeper and still deeper mourning for him, until it was become so funereal as to want nothing but a body in it to be quite complete.\n No bad representation of the body, for the nonce, in his unbending form, if not in his attitude, Mr Dombey looked down into the cold depths of the dead sea of mahogany on which the fruit dishes and decanters lay at anchor: as if the subjects of his thoughts were rising towards the surface one by one, and plunging down again. Edith was there In all her majesty of brow and figure; and close to her came Florence, with her timid head turned to him, as it had been, for an instant, when she left the room; and Edith\u0027s eyes upon her, and Edith\u0027s hand put out protectingly. A little figure in a low arm-chair came springing next into the light, and looked upon him wonderingly, with its bright eyes and its old-young face, gleaming as in the flickering of an evening fire. Again came Florence close upon it, and absorbed his whole attention. Whether as a fore-doomed difficulty and disappointment to him; whether as a rival who had crossed him in his way, and might again; whether as his child, of whom, in his successful wooing, he could stoop to think as claiming, at such a time, to be no more estranged; or whether as a hint to him that the mere appearance of caring for his own blood should be maintained in his new relations; he best knew. Indifferently well, perhaps, at best; for marriage company and marriage altars, and ambitious scenes - still blotted here and there with Florence - always Florence - turned up so fast, and so confusedly, that he rose, and went upstairs to escape them.\n It was quite late at night before candles were brought; for at present they made Mrs Skewton\u0027s head ache, she complained; and in the meantime Florence and Mrs Skewton talked together (Cleopatra being very anxious to keep her close to herself), or Florence touched the piano softly for Mrs Skewton\u0027s delight; to make no mention of a few occasions in the course of the evening, when that affectionate lady was impelled to solicit another kiss, and which always happened after Edith had said anything. They were not many, however, for Edith sat apart by an open window during the whole time (in spite of her mother\u0027s fears that she would take cold), and remained there until Mr Dombey took leave. He was serenely gracious to Florence when he did so; and Florence went to bed in a room within Edith\u0027s, so happy and hopeful, that she thought of her late self as if it were some other poor deserted girl who was to be pitied for her sorrow; and in her pity, sobbed herself to sleep.\n The week fled fast. There were drives to milliners, dressmakers, jewellers, lawyers, florists, pastry-cooks; and Florence was always of the party. Florence was to go to the wedding. Florence was to cast off her mourning, and to wear a brilliant dress on the occasion. The milliner\u0027s intentions on the subject of this dress - the milliner was a Frenchwoman, and greatly resembled Mrs Skewton - were so chaste and elegant, that Mrs Skewton bespoke one like it for herself. The milliner said it would become her to admiration, and that all the world would take her for the young lady\u0027s sister.\n The week fled faster. Edith looked at nothing and cared for nothing. Her rich dresses came home, and were tried on, and were loudly commended by Mrs Skewton and the milliners, and were put away without a word from her. Mrs Skewton made their plans for every day, and executed them. Sometimes Edith sat in the carriage when they went to make purchases; sometimes, when it was absolutely necessary, she went into the shops. But Mrs Skewton conducted the whole business, whatever it happened to be; and Edith looked on as uninterested and with as much apparent indifference as if she had no concern in it. Florence might perhaps have thought she was haughty and listless, but that she was never so to her. So Florence quenched her wonder in her gratitude whenever it broke out, and soon subdued it.\n The week fled faster. It had nearly winged its flight away. The last night of the week, the night before the marriage, was come. In the dark room - for Mrs Skewton\u0027s head was no better yet, though she expected to recover permanently to-morrow - were that lady, Edith, and Mr Dombey. Edith was at her open window looking out into the street; Mr Dombey and Cleopatra were talking softly on the sofa. It was growing late; and Florence, being fatigued, had gone to bed.\n \u0027My dear Dombey,\u0027 said Cleopatra, \u0027you will leave me Florence to-morrow, when you deprive me of my sweetest Edith.\u0027\n Mr Dombey said he would, with pleasure.\n \u0027To have her about me, here, while you are both at Paris, and to think at her age, I am assisting in the formation of her mind, my dear Dombey,\u0027 said Cleopatra, \u0027will be a perfect balm to me in the extremely shattered state to which I shall be reduced.\u0027\n Edith turned her head suddenly. Her listless manner was exchanged, in a moment, to one of burning interest, and, unseen in the darkness, she attended closely to their conversation.\n Mr Dombey would be delighted to leave Florence in such admirable guardianship.\n \u0027My dear Dombey,\u0027 returned Cleopatra, \u0027a thousand thanks for your good opinion. I feared you were going, with malice aforethought\u0027 as the dreadful lawyers say - those horrid proses! - to condemn me to utter solitude;\u0027\n \u0027Why do me so great an injustice, my dear madam?\u0027 said Mr Dombey.\n \u0027Because my charming Florence tells me so positively she must go home tomorrow, returned Cleopatra, that I began to be afraid, my dearest Dombey, you were quite a Bashaw.\u0027\n \u0027I assure you, madam!\u0027 said Mr Dombey, \u0027I have laid no commands on Florence; and if I had, there are no commands like your wish.\u0027\n \u0027My dear Dombey,\u0027 replied Cleopatra, what a courtier you are! Though I\u0027ll not say so, either; for courtiers have no heart, and yours pervades your farming life and character. And are you really going so early, my dear Dombey!\u0027\n Oh, indeed! it was late, and Mr Dombey feared he must.\n \u0027Is this a fact, or is it all a dream!\u0027 lisped Cleopatra. \u0027Can I believe, my dearest Dombey, that you are coming back tomorrow morning to deprive me of my sweet companion; my own Edith!\u0027\n Mr Dombey, who was accustomed to take things literally, reminded Mrs Skewton that they were to meet first at the church.\n \u0027The pang,\u0027 said Mrs Skewton, \u0027of consigning a child, even to you, my dear Dombey, is one of the most excruciating imaginable, and combined with a naturally delicate constitution, and the extreme stupidity of the pastry-cook who has undertaken the breakfast, is almost too much for my poor strength. But I shall rally, my dear Dombey, In the morning; do not fear for me, or be uneasy on my account. Heaven bless you! My dearest Edith!\u0027 she cried archly. \u0027Somebody is going, pet.\u0027\n Edith, who had turned her head again towards the window, and whose interest in their conversation had ceased, rose up in her place, but made no advance towards him, and said nothing. Mr Dombey, with a lofty gallantry adapted to his dignity and the occasion, betook his creaking boots towards her, put her hand to his lips, said, \u0027Tomorrow morning I shall have the happiness of claiming this hand as Mrs Dombey\u0027s,\u0027 and bowed himself solemnly out.\n Mrs Skewton rang for candles as soon as the house-door had closed upon him. With the candles appeared her maid, with the juvenile dress that was to delude the world to-morrow. The dress had savage retribution in it, as such dresses ever have, and made her infinitely older and more hideous than her greasy flannel gown. But Mrs Skewton tried it on with mincing satisfaction; smirked at her cadaverous self in the glass, as she thought of its killing effect upon the Major; and suffering her maid to take it off again, and to prepare her for repose, tumbled into ruins like a house of painted cards.\n All this time, Edith remained at the dark window looking out into the street. When she and her mother were at last left alone, she moved from it for the first time that evening, and came opposite to her. The yawning, shaking, peevish figure of the mother, with her eyes raised to confront the proud erect form of the daughter, whose glance of fire was bent downward upon her, had a conscious air upon it, that no levity or temper could conceal.\n \u0027I am tired to death,\u0027 said she. \u0027You can\u0027t be trusted for a moment. You are worse than a child. Child! No child would be half so obstinate and undutiful.\u0027\n \u0027Listen to me, mother,\u0027 returned Edith, passing these words by with a scorn that would not descend to trifle with them. \u0027You must remain alone here until I return.\u0027\n \u0027Must remain alone here, Edith, until you return!\u0027 repeated her mother.\n \u0027Or in that name upon which I shall call to-morrow to witness what I do, so falsely: and so shamefully, I swear I will refuse the hand of this man in the church. If I do not, may I fall dead upon the pavement!\u0027\n The mother answered with a look of quick alarm, in no degree diminished by the look she met.\n \u0027It is enough,\u0027 said Edith, steadily, \u0027that we are what we are. I will have no youth and truth dragged down to my level. I will have no guileless nature undermined, corrupted, and perverted, to amuse the leisure of a world of mothers. You know my meaning. Florence must go home.\u0027\n \u0027You are an idiot, Edith,\u0027 cried her angry mother. \u0027Do you expect there can ever be peace for you in that house, till she is married, and away?\u0027\n \u0027Ask me, or ask yourself, if I ever expect peace in that house,\u0027 said her daughter, \u0027and you know the answer.\n \u0027And am I to be told to-night, after all my pains and labour, and when you are going, through me, to be rendered independent,\u0027 her mother almost shrieked in her passion, while her palsied head shook like a leaf, \u0027that there is corruption and contagion in me, and that I am not fit company for a girl! What are you, pray? What are you?\u0027\n \u0027I have put the question to myself,\u0027 said Edith, ashy pale, and pointing to the window, \u0027more than once when I have been sitting there, and something in the faded likeness of my sex has wandered past outside; and God knows I have met with my reply. Oh mother, mother, if you had but left me to my natural heart when I too was a girl - a younger girl than Florence - how different I might have been!\u0027\n Sensible that any show of anger was useless here, her mother restrained herself, and fell a whimpering, and bewailed that she had lived too long, and that her only child had cast her off, and that duty towards parents was forgotten in these evil days, and that she had heard unnatural taunts, and cared for life no longer.\n \u0027If one is to go on living through continual scenes like this,\u0027 she whined,\u0027I am sure it would be much better for me to think of some means of putting an end to my existence. Oh! The idea of your being my daughter, Edith, and addressing me in such a strain!\u0027\n \u0027Between us, mother,\u0027 returned Edith, mournfully, \u0027the time for mutual reproaches is past.\n \u0027Then why do you revive it?\u0027 whimpered her mother. \u0027You know that you are lacerating me in the cruellest manner. You know how sensitive I am to unkindness. At such a moment, too, when I have so much to think of, and am naturally anxious to appear to the best advantage! I wonder at you, Edith. To make your mother a fright upon your wedding-day!\u0027\n Edith bent the same fixed look upon her, as she sobbed and rubbed her eyes; and said in the same low steady voice, which had neither risen nor fallen since she first addressed her, \u0027I have said that Florence must go home.\u0027\n \u0027Let her go!\u0027 cried the afflicted and affrighted parent, hastily. \u0027I am sure I am willing she should go. What is the girl to me?\u0027\n \u0027She is so much to me, that rather than communicate, or suffer to be communicated to her, one grain of the evil that is in my breast, mother, I would renounce you, as I would (if you gave me cause) renounce him in the church to-morrow,\u0027 replied Edith. \u0027Leave her alone. She shall not, while I can interpose, be tampered with and tainted by the lessons I have learned. This is no hard condition on this bitter night.\u0027\n \u0027If you had proposed it in a filial manner, Edith,\u0027 whined her mother, \u0027perhaps not; very likely not. But such extremely cutting words - \u0027\n \u0027They are past and at an end between us now,\u0027 said Edith. \u0027Take your own way, mother; share as you please in what you have gained; spend, enjoy, make much of it; and be as happy as you will. The object of our lives is won. Henceforth let us wear it silently. My lips are closed upon the past from this hour. I forgive you your part in to-morrow\u0027s wickedness. May God forgive my own!\u0027\n Without a tremor in her voice, or frame, and passing onward with a foot that set itself upon the neck of every soft emotion, she bade her mother good-night, and repaired to her own room.\n But not to rest; for there was no rest in the tumult of her agitation when alone to and fro, and to and fro, and to and fro again, five hundred times, among the splendid preparations for her adornment on the morrow; with her dark hair shaken down, her dark eyes flashing with a raging light, her broad white bosom red with the cruel grasp of the relentless hand with which she spurned it from her, pacing up and down with an averted head, as if she would avoid the sight of her own fair person, and divorce herself from its companionship. Thus, In the dead time of the night before her bridal, Edith Granger wrestled with her unquiet spirit, tearless, friendless, silent, proud, and uncomplaining.\n At length it happened that she touched the open door which led into the room where Florence lay.\n She started, stopped, and looked in.\n A light was burning there, and showed her Florence in her bloom of innocence and beauty, fast asleep. Edith held her breath, and felt herself drawn on towards her.\n Drawn nearer, nearer, nearer yet; at last, drawn so near, that stooping down, she pressed her lips to the gentle hand that lay outside the bed, and put it softly to her neck. Its touch was like the prophet\u0027s rod of old upon the rock. Her tears sprung forth beneath it, as she sunk upon her knees, and laid her aching head and streaming hair upon the pillow by its side.\n Thus Edith Granger passed the night before her bridal. Thus the sun found her on her bridal morning.\n 被施加了魔力的房屋已经不再存在，工作的人们已经进入屋内，整天用锤子叮叮当当敲打着，搬移物品时发出了碰撞的响声，并踩着沉重的脚步，在楼梯上上上下下地走着；他们使戴奥吉尼斯从日出到日落，不断发出一阵阵吠叫——显然，他相信敌人终于打败了他，现在正在胜利的挑战中掠夺着房屋。虽然这样一些新的情况出现了，可是弗洛伦斯的生活方式最初并没有发生其他重大的变化。夜间，当工人们离开以后，房屋又显得凄凉和冷落；他们离开的时候，弗洛伦斯听着他们通过门厅和楼梯发出的回声，心中想象着他们即将回去的快乐的家庭和正在等待着他们的孩子们；她高兴地想到他们是愉快的，是欢欢喜喜地离开这里的。\n 她欢迎晚间的寂静像一个老朋友一样重新返回；但是它现在来到的时候换了一个新的脸孔，比过去更亲切地看着她。这里面包含着新鲜的希望。在那个曾经使她伤心的房间中安慰和爱抚过她的那位美丽的夫人，对她来说，是一位带来希望的仙人。当她将逐渐取得父亲的爱的时候，当在那个悲惨的日子（就在这一天，母亲对她的爱，随着她贴在她脸颊上的最后的呼吸一起消失了）她所失去的一切或其中的大部分将重新得到的时候，光明的生活的黎明就将来临了；现在它的温柔的影子正在曙光中在她的四周移动，成了她所欢迎的伴侣。当她在窥视着邻居脸色红润的孩子们的时候，她想到她跟他们不久就可以在一起谈话，相互认识了；那时候她就将不再像过去那样害怕在他们眼前露面，唯恐她们看到她穿着黑色的丧服孤独地坐在那里会感到悲伤了；她想着这些事情的时候，是有一种新鲜和宝贵的感觉的。\n 当弗洛伦斯想着她的新的母亲时，当她纯洁的心向她溢流出爱和信任时，她愈来愈深切地爱着她死去的亲母亲。她不害怕在心中树立一个竞争者。她知道，在种植得很深、抚育得很久的老根上会长出新的花朵。那位美丽的夫人嘴中说出的每一句温柔的话，都像久已沉寂的声音的回声一样响着。她对亲母亲的回忆过去曾经是她对父母双亲的亲切关怀与慈爱的唯一的回忆；现在，当新的亲切关怀来临的时候，她怎么就能减少对那老回忆的喜爱呢？\n 有一天，弗洛伦斯坐在她的房间里看书并想着这位夫人和她答应不久就将来看望她的诺言（因为书里写的是与这类似的故事），当她抬起眼睛的时候，她看到她正站在门口。\n “妈妈！”弗洛伦斯快活地迎上前去，喊道，“你又来啦！”\n “现在还不是妈妈，”那位夫人用胳膊搂住弗洛伦斯的脖子的时候，庄重地微笑着回答道。\n “但是很快就要是了，”弗洛伦斯喊道。\n “现在很快了，弗洛伦斯，很快了。”\n 伊迪丝把头稍微低下一些，以便把她的脸颊紧贴着弗洛伦斯鲜嫩美丽的脸颊上；她们这样沉默地保持了几秒钟。她的态度中包含着极为亲切的感情，弗洛伦斯甚至比她们第一次见面时更深切地感觉到它。\n 她把弗洛伦斯领到身旁的一张椅子那里，坐下来；弗洛伦斯看着她的脸孔，对它的美丽感到十分惊奇，并乐意地把手放在她的手里。\n “自从我上次到这里来以后，你一直是一个人吗，弗洛伦斯？”\n “是的！”弗洛伦斯微笑着急忙回答道。\n 她迟疑着，低垂下眼睛，因为她的新妈妈的眼光十分恳切，那眼光在聚精会神地、若有所思地注视着她的脸孔。\n “我——我——一个人已经习惯了，”弗洛伦斯说道，“我根本不在乎。有时就是戴和我两个在一起度过整整几天。”弗洛伦斯本来可以说整整几个星期和整整几个月的。\n “戴是你的侍女吗，亲爱的？”\n “是我的狗，妈妈，”弗洛伦斯大笑着说道，“我的侍女是苏珊。”\n “这些就是你的房间吧？”伊迪丝向四周看看，说道，“那天没领我来看这些房间。我们一定把它们修缮得更好，弗洛伦斯。它们应当成为这座房屋中最漂亮的房间。”\n “如果我可以掉换它们的话，妈妈，”弗洛伦斯回答道，“那么我更喜欢楼上的一间。”\n “难道这里还不够高吗，亲爱的孩子？”伊迪丝微笑着问道。\n “那里是我的弟弟的房间，”弗洛伦斯说道，“我很喜欢它。我回家的时候，发现工人们在这里，什么都在改变着，我本想把我的这个意见跟爸爸说的，可是——”\n 弗洛伦斯低下眼睛，只怕那同样的眼光又会使她结巴起来。\n “——可是我担心那会使他痛苦，而且，妈妈，你又说过你很快就要回来的，并且将是这里支配一切的女主人，所以我就决定鼓起勇气向你请求。”\n 伊迪丝坐在那里看着她，发亮的眼睛一直在注视着她的脸孔，直到弗洛伦斯抬起眼睛的时候，这才轮到她把眼光收回去，改看着地面。就在这时候，弗洛伦斯想到这位夫人的美丽和她初次见面时所想的是多么不同。她曾经以为她是高傲的、难以接近的，可是她现在的态度是这么和蔼、温柔，即使她的年龄和性格与弗洛伦斯一模一样，她也未必能比现在取得更大的信任。\n 但当一种勉强和奇怪地克制自己的沉着的神色悄悄笼罩着她的时候，情况就不同了。这时候，仿佛在弗洛伦斯面前，她看上去感到自己卑贱和很不自在似的（不过弗洛伦斯对这很不理解，虽然不能不注意到它和想到它）。当她刚才说她现在还不是妈妈的时候，当弗洛伦斯称她是这里支配一切的女主人的时候，她身上的这种变化是迅速的和令人惊异的；现在，当弗洛伦斯的眼睛凝视着她的脸孔的时候，她坐在那里，好像恨不得把身子收缩起来，隐藏起来，不让弗洛伦斯看见似的，而不像是个根据这种近亲的权利，将要喜爱她和抚育她的人。\n 她答应弗洛伦斯给她掉换新房间，并说她将亲自下命令。然后她问了几个关于可怜的保罗的问题；当她们坐着交谈了一些时候之后，她告诉弗洛伦斯，她是来领她到自己家里去的。\n “我们现在已经搬到伦敦来了，我母亲和我，”伊迪丝说道，“你将和我们住在一起，直到我结婚。我希望我们将相互了解和信任，弗洛伦斯。”\n “你对我太好了，”弗洛伦斯说，“亲爱的妈妈，我多么感谢你！”\n “让我就趁现在说吧，因为这是最好的机会，”伊迪丝向四下里看看，想知道她们是不是就是两个人，并用较低的声音继续说道，“当我结婚之后外出几个星期的时候，如果你能回到这边的家里来的话，那么我就会觉得放心些。不论是谁邀请你住到别的地方去，你还是回到这边的家里来。你一个人在这里比——”她抑制住自己，没有把话说完，然后又接下去说，“我想说的是，我知道你在家里最好，亲爱的弗洛伦斯。”\n “我当天就回到家里来，妈妈。”\n “好，就这么办吧。我相信你的话。现在，亲爱的孩子，你就去收拾收拾，准备跟我走吧。你一切都弄妥了就到楼下来找我。”\n 伊迪丝一个人慢吞吞地和若有所思地走过这个不久她将成为女主人的公馆，很少去注意它即将显示出的富丽堂皇的气派。就像她过去在绿荫的树林下曾经猛烈地放纵、发泄过她的愤怒一样，她现在怀着同样难以驯服的傲慢的心灵，从眼睛和嘴唇中表露出同样高傲的、目空一切的神气，在姿容中闪耀着同样光彩夺目的美丽（只是由于她觉得它毫无价值，四周的一切也都毫无价值，因此这光彩不那么强烈罢了），走过这些豪华的客厅和大厅。绘画在墙壁和地板上的玫瑰花，四周围绕着尖利的刺，把她的胸膛都刺裂了；在每一片耀眼的金片中，她看到了她的可恨的买身钱的微粒；又宽又高的镜子向她照出了一个女人的全身；她还没有完全失去高贵的品质，但跟她更美好的自身比较，显得太虚伪了，太卑贱了，太毁坏无遗了，已经到了不可救药的地步。她相信，在所有人看来，在不同程度上，这一切都是清清楚楚的，因此，她找不到别的办法或力量，只有凭借着高傲才能使她逞强自负，并凭借着这个日夜折磨着她的心灵的高傲，她跟自己的命运斗争到底，抵抗它，反抗它。难道这就是弗洛伦斯——一个天真烂漫的女孩子，只是由于真诚与纯洁而有力量——能深深感动她和征服她的那个女人吗？难道这就是在弗洛伦斯身边成了完全不同的一个人，暴怒顿时熄灭，甚至连高傲也顿时消退的那个女人吗？难道这就是现在在马车中坐在弗洛伦斯身边，合抱着双臂，当弗洛伦斯恳求她爱她和信任她的时候，她就把美丽的头贴近她的胸脯，并准备牺牲生命来保卫它免遭污辱和欺凌的那个女人吗？\n 啊，伊迪丝！就在这样的时候死去是多么好啊！也许，伊迪丝，现在就这么死去要比继续活下去要好得多，要幸福得多啊！\n 尊敬的斯丘顿夫人完全没有这样一类想法，因为，像许多在不同时代生活过的出身高贵的人们一样，她总是扭转脸孔，躲开死亡，而且反对别人提起这个十分卑劣的、不分贵贱地把所有人都拉平的、趾高气扬的怪物。她在格罗斯文诺广场布鲁克街从一位高贵的亲戚（菲尼克斯家族中的一位）那里借了一栋房屋。这位亲戚离开伦敦了；他极为慷慨地把房屋借给他们用来结婚，并把这作为一笔礼物，他就免得再向斯丘顿夫人和她的女儿贷款和送礼了。为了维护家庭的荣誉，在这种时候有必要使各方面都显得光彩体面，所以斯丘顿夫人找到了一位住在玛丽勒博恩教区的商人帮忙；这位商人是个容易打交道的人，他向贵族和绅士出借各种家庭用品，从成套餐具到一群仆人，无不应有尽有。他给这栋房屋提供了一位白发苍苍的男管家（他由于具有古代家庭侍从的相貌，还多拿一笔钱）、两位穿着制服、身材很高的年轻人，还有一些精选的厨房仆人。这一来，地下室就散播着一个传说，说童仆威瑟斯突然一下摆脱了原先的无数的家庭杂务，也摆脱了推轮椅的累活（在都城中推轮椅是不合适的），大家好几次看到他揉着眼睛，捏着手脚，仿佛他怀疑是不是在莱明顿牛奶店里睡过了头，现在还在做着天堂里的美梦呢。餐具、瓷器以及其他各种各样的家庭用具全都由同一个方向的来源供应到这个邸宅中来，其中还包括一辆整洁精致的四轮轻便马车和两匹栗色马。斯丘顿夫人按照克利奥特拉佩的姿势，坐在一张主沙发的坐垫中间，庄严得体地摆出女王的架子，接受觐见。\n “我可爱的弗洛伦斯好吗？”斯丘顿夫人在女儿和她的被保护者进来时，说道，“你一定得过来亲亲我，弗洛伦斯，如果你愿意的话，我亲爱的。”\n 弗洛伦斯胆怯地弯下身去，正在斯丘顿夫人脸上白的部分找一块地方，这时那位夫人凑上耳朵，使她摆脱了困境。\n “伊迪丝，我亲爱的，”斯丘顿夫人说道，“确实，我——\n 请你站到靠亮光一点的地方，亲爱的弗洛伦斯。”\n 弗洛伦斯脸羞得通红地依从了。\n “你可记得，我最亲爱的伊迪丝，”她的母亲说道，“当你跟我们可爱的宝贝弗洛伦斯差不多年纪或小几岁的时候，你是怎么样的吗？”\n “我早忘了，妈妈。”\n “说真的，我亲爱的，”斯丘顿夫人说道，“我发现我们这位极为标致的年轻朋友跟你那时候真是像透了，同时也表明，”斯丘顿夫人压低了声音，说道，“教养是多么重要。”这说明，在她看来，弗洛伦斯还远没有教养完善。\n “是的，不错，”伊迪丝冷淡地回答道。\n 她的母亲敏锐地看了她一眼，感到她本人已陷入危险的境地；为了转移注意力，就说道：\n “我可爱的弗洛伦斯，你一定得过来再亲我一下，如果你愿意的话，我亲爱的。”\n 弗洛伦斯自然依从了，于是又把嘴唇压到她的耳朵上。\n “我亲爱的宝贝，你毫无疑问已经听说了，”斯丘顿夫人拉着她的手，说道，“你的爸爸——我们全都无限崇拜和热爱他——再过一个星期就要跟我最亲爱的伊迪丝结婚了。”\n “我知道很快了，”弗洛伦斯回答道，“不过不知道确切的日期。”\n “我的宝贝伊迪丝，”她的母亲快活地催促道，“这可能吗，你怎么还没有告诉弗洛伦斯？”\n “我为什么要告诉弗洛伦斯？”她回答得那么突然和生硬，因此弗洛伦斯简直不能相信这是她的声音。\n 斯丘顿夫人为了再一次转移注意力和脱离危险，就告诉弗洛伦斯，她爸爸将到这里来吃晚饭，他看到她将无疑会又惊奇又高兴；因为昨天晚上他在城里谈到了服装方面的事情，一点也不知道伊迪丝的计划，斯丘顿夫人料想这样一定会使他喜出望外。弗洛伦斯听到这些话以后，心烦意乱，临近吃晚饭的时候，她的苦恼更加剧烈；如果她知道怎样请求允许她回家去，而且在解释时不牵涉到她父亲的话，那么她真愿意光着脚，不戴帽子，独自一人，急忙跑回家去，而不愿冒这种会引起他不高兴的危险。\n 时间愈来愈近，她简直透不过气来。她不敢走近窗口，唯恐他从街上看见她。她不敢走上楼去掩饰她的情绪，唯恐走出门口的时候，她会意外地遇见他；除了这种害怕外，她还觉得，如果把她喊到他面前去的话，那么她就好像再也没有勇气回来似的。她苦恼不安地怀着这些恐惧的心情，坐在克利奥佩特拉的长沙发旁边，用心听着和回答着这位夫人枯燥无味的谈话，这时候她突然听到楼梯上响起了他的脚步声。\n “我听到他的脚步了！”弗洛伦斯惊跳起来，喊道，“他来了！”\n 克利奥佩特拉由于她那老天真的脾气，时常爱开个玩笑，而且由于自以为是，没有花心思去研究一下弗洛伦斯刚才激动的性质，所以她把弗洛伦斯推到她的长沙发的后面，把一块围巾抛到她的身上，准备给董贝先生来一个惊喜交集。这一切做得非常之快，一转眼的工夫，弗洛伦斯就听到他那可怕的脚步声进入了房间。\n 他向未来的岳母和未来的新娘问候致意。他嗓门的奇怪声音使他的女儿听了全身颤抖。\n “我亲爱的董贝，”克利奥佩特拉说道，“到这里来告诉我，你的可爱的弗洛伦斯好吗？”\n “弗洛伦斯很好，”董贝先生向长沙发走去，说道。\n “在家吗？”\n “在家，”董贝先生说道。\n “我亲爱的董贝，”克利奥佩特拉露出极为美妙动人、高兴活泼的神色，回答道，“你是不是肯定你没有骗我？我不知道当我对你进行责备之后，我最亲爱的伊迪丝会怎么说我，不过，说实话，我担心你是世界上最不诚实的男子了，我亲爱的董贝。”\n 即使他真的是这样，即使他当场被揭露过去确实有极为大量的虚伪言行的话，那么他也未心会比斯丘顿夫人掀开围巾之后，弗洛伦斯脸色苍白、浑身哆嗦、像幽灵似地站在他面前的时候更为仓皇失措的了。他还没有恢复镇静，弗洛伦斯就跑到他面前，双手搂着他的脖子，吻了一下他的脸孔，急急忙忙跑出了房间。他向四周看看，仿佛想和其他人商讨一下这个问题似的，可是伊迪丝立即就跟着弗洛伦斯走出去了。\n “现在，请承认吧，我亲爱的董贝，”斯丘顿夫人向他伸出手去，说道，“你这一生中从没遇到过这样令人惊奇和高兴的事了吧！”\n “我从没遇到过这样令人惊奇的事。”\n “也从没遇到过这样高兴的事吧，我亲爱的董贝？”斯丘顿夫人举起扇子，问道：\n “我——对，我非常高兴在这里遇见弗洛伦斯，”董贝先生说道；他似乎严肃地考虑了一会儿，然后更加肯定地说道，“是的，我的确很高兴在这里遇见弗洛伦斯。”\n “你是不是奇怪，她怎么会到这里来的呢？”斯丘顿夫人问道，“是不是？”\n “也许是，伊迪丝——”董贝先生推测着说道。\n “啊！你这可恶的猜测者！”克利奥佩特拉摇摇头，回答道，“啊，你这狡猾、狡猾的人！我不应当说这些事情；你们男人，我亲爱的董贝，虚荣心是多么重，是多么喜欢作弄我们的弱点；但是你知道，我的心胸是坦率的——好，立刻就来！”\n 最后几个字是对两位身材很高的年轻人当中的一位说的，他进来通报，晚饭已经准备好。\n “但是伊迪丝，亲爱的董贝，”她继续低声地说道，“当她看不到你在他身旁的时候——我告诉她，她不能经常指望这一点——，至少可以看到属于你的什么东西或什么人。是的，这是极为自然的事。她怀着这样的心情，谁也不能阻挡她今天坐着马车去把我们亲爱的弗洛伦斯接来。你看，这是多么可爱的事啊！”\n 因为她等待着回答，董贝先生就回答道，“确实是这样。”\n “亲爱的董贝，这证明了你有着善良的心，愿上帝为这保佑你！”克利奥佩特拉握紧他的手，喊道，“可是我有些太认真了！请像个天使一样，领我到楼下去吧，看看这些人准备给我吃什么晚饭。愿上帝保佑你，亲爱的董贝！”\n 克利奥佩特拉在进行了第二次祝福之后，相当敏捷地跳下长沙发；董贝先生搀着她的胳膊，礼节十分周到地领着她下了楼；当这两个人走进餐厅的时候，雇来的身材很高的年轻人当中的一位（他向主人表示尊敬的器官是很不发达的）把舌头伸到脸颊上，在给另一位雇来的身材很高的年轻人逗乐。\n 弗洛伦斯和伊迪丝已经在那里，并肩坐着。弗洛伦斯在父亲进来的时候本想站起来，把她的椅子让给他；但是伊迪丝用手坚决地拉住她的胳膊，董贝先生就在圆桌对面的座位上坐下。\n 谈话几乎完全由斯丘顿夫人一人支撑着。弗洛伦斯简直不敢抬起眼睛，唯恐显露出泪痕，更不敢说话了；伊迪丝除了回答一个问题外，一个字也没有说。克利奥佩特拉为了很快就要抓到手中的家业，确实很努力地工作着。这也确实是一份富有的家业，可以好好酬劳她的！\n “这么说，你的一切准备终于就要结束了吗，我亲爱的董贝？”当最后的点心、水果端到桌上，白发苍苍的男管家退出去以后，克利奥佩特拉说道，“甚至连法律方面的准备工作也完成了！”\n “是的，夫人，”董贝先生回答道，“律师们告诉我，婚约现在已准备好了，正像我对您说的，伊迪丝只要指定个签订的日期就行了。”\n 伊迪丝像美丽的塑像一样坐着；像塑像一样冷淡，一样沉默，一样一动不动。\n “我最亲爱的，”克利奥佩特拉说道，“你听到董贝先生说了吗？啊，我亲爱的董贝！”她转向这位先生，低声说道，“她因为时间快到而心不在焉的神态真使我想起了以往的那些日子啊，那时候，她爸爸那位世上少见的好人，就跟你现在的处境一样！”\n “我不想建议什么日子。您喜欢什么时候就什么时候，”伊迪丝眼光几乎没有越过桌面，看着董贝先生，说道。\n “明天？”，董贝先生建议。\n “随您的便。”\n “或者后天也可以，如果这更适合您安排料理各种事情的话？”董贝先生说道。\n “我没有什么事情要安排料理。我总是听随您支配。您看什么日子就定什么日子吧。”\n “没有什么事情要安排料理，我亲爱的伊迪丝！”她的母亲表示异议，说道，“要知道，你得从早到晚忙得团团转，你得跟各种各样的商人打一千零一次交道！”\n “这由你去操办吧，”伊迪丝微微皱着眉头，转向她，回答道，“你跟董贝先生两人去商量安排好了。”\n “完全正确，我亲爱的，你考虑得真周到！”克利奥佩特拉说道，“我亲爱的弗洛伦斯，你一定得真心到这里来再亲我一次，如果你愿意的话，我亲爱的！”\n 这是个奇怪的巧合：克利奥佩特拉对弗洛伦斯的这种关切，总是在她急忙要避开伊迪丝进来参加谈话之后，不论她谈的话是多么少！弗洛伦斯确实从来也没有接受过这么多的拥抱，也许在她的一生中也从来没有在无意间成为这样有用的人。\n 董贝先生在内心深处对他的美丽的未婚妻根本没有什么埋怨。他有充分理由同情她的傲慢与冷淡，因为他本人也同样具有这样的性格。他很高兴地想到，伊迪丝尊重他的意见，似乎他的意志就是她的意志。他很高兴地想象，这位高傲与庄严的女人怎样仿效他的态度在家中接待客人，使得他们拘谨畏缩。是的，董贝父子公司的尊严将会在这样的手中得到增进与维护。\n 当董贝先生独自一人留在餐桌旁，默默地思考着他的过去与未来的命运时，他是这样想的：他觉得他的这些命运跟这房间笼罩着的简陋与阴沉的气氛并没有什么不适合；房间是深褐色的，像丧徽一样的图画玷污了墙壁；二十四把黑色的椅子像被雇用的送丧人一样，在土耳其地毯的边缘等待着，椅子上装饰着许许多多的钉子，就像棺材的数目一样多①；餐具柜上枝状烛台的两枝凋残的烛枝由两位筋疲力尽的黑人托举着；房间里弥漫着一股发霉的气味，仿佛一万顿正餐正封埋在下面的石棺里面。房屋的主人有很多时间住在国外，英国的空气难能长期适合菲尼克斯家族中一位成员的喜爱；房间为他逐渐地穿上了愈来愈深的丧服，直到最后，丧葬的气氛已经十分浓厚了，除了尸体之外，什么也不缺了。\n --------\n ①（某人或某事）棺材上的一个钉子（anailinsb’s（orit’s）coffin）是英国的一句成语，意即加速某人（或某事）灭亡的原因。这里把钉子数与棺材数相比，是由这句成语引起的联想。\n 由董贝先生暂且代表这具尸体倒也不坏，因为如果不去考虑他的姿势，单就他那毫不弯曲的身形来说，它和尸体实在没有什么差别。桃花心木的餐桌就像一片死海，水果盘子和圆酒瓶正停泊在海上，董贝先生低垂着眼睛，看着这片死海寒冷的深处，仿佛他在思考的人物正一个个地升浮到海面，然后又重新沉没下去。这里是伊迪丝，脸孔和身姿中呈现出威严的神态；紧挨着她的是弗洛伦斯，神色胆怯地朝着他，就跟她刚才离开房间那一刹那间的情形一样；伊迪丝的眼睛注视着她，伊迪丝伸出手来保护她。接着，一个坐在低矮的扶手椅中的小人儿突然出现在亮光中，惊奇地望着他；他那明亮的眼睛和又年轻又老态的脸孔就像晚间闪烁的炉火一样闪发出亮光。弗洛伦斯又来到了小人儿的身旁，吸引了他的全部注意力。董贝先生注意她，是不是由于她是注定要给他带来困难和使他感到失望的人呢？或者是不是由于她是曾经挡住他的道路，并可能再次挡住他的道路的劲敌呢？或者是不是由于她是他的孩子，现在他在求婚获得成功的时候，可以软下心来想一想她，因为她在这样的时候要求不再被他疏远了呢？或者是不是她对他是一种暗示：现在当他建立了新的家庭的时候，他必须至少在表面上对他的亲骨肉表示出一点关心呢？这一切只有他本人最明白。但也许他对这些并没有认真思考过，他心中充其量也仍然是模糊不清的，因为婚礼呀，圣坛呀以及雄心勃勃的远景呀（到处仍然都有个弗洛伦斯的黑点在里面，老是有弗洛伦斯），十分迅速地和杂乱无章地在他的心中闪现出来，因此，他只好站起身来，走上楼去避开它们。\n 夜里一直到很晚的时候也还没有点蜡烛，因为斯丘顿夫人抱怨，现在点蜡烛会使她头疼；整个晚上，弗洛伦斯和斯丘顿夫人谈着话（克利奥佩特拉急切地把她留在身边），或者是弗洛伦斯轻轻弹着钢琴给斯丘顿夫人消遣；那位慈爱的夫人有时还不得不要求弗洛伦斯再去亲她一下，而这又总是在伊迪丝说了什么话之后。不过伊迪丝说得不多，她不顾她母亲担心她会着凉，一直独自一人坐在打开的窗子旁边，直到董贝先生告辞之后才离开。他告别时，沉着平静地对弗洛伦斯表示了礼貌。弗洛伦斯走到邻近伊迪丝卧室的房间中去睡觉时感到十分幸福，充满了希望；当她想到她的过去时，就像想到另一个可怜的、被遗弃的女孩子一样；对这个女孩子的不幸是应当寄予同情的，她就在这种同情中哭泣着，哭泣着，睡去了。\n 这个星期过得很快。乘车前往妇女服饰店、缝纫店、珠宝店、律师事务所、花店和糕点店。弗洛伦斯经常陪着一道去。弗洛伦斯将参加婚礼。那时弗洛伦斯必须脱去丧服，穿上华丽的服装。妇女服饰商是一位法国女人，面貌很像斯丘顿夫人；她对弗洛伦斯这套服装的设计思想十分高雅、优美，所以斯丘顿夫人就给她自己也预定了式样相似的一套；那位妇女服饰商说，她穿起来一定人人赞美，大家都会以为她是那位小姐的姐姐呢。\n 这个星期过得更快了。伊迪丝什么也不看，什么也不关心。豪华的服装给她送到家里来，进行了试穿；斯丘顿夫人和妇女服饰商对它们高声赞扬，她则一声不吭地把它们收放起来。斯丘顿夫人拟订她们每天的计划，并执行着这些计划。有时候她们去买东西时，伊迪丝就在马车里坐着；有时候，当绝对有必要时，她才走进商店。但是不论在什么情况下，斯丘顿夫人都指挥着一切，而伊迪丝则毫无兴趣，显然冷冷淡淡地看着这一切，仿佛她对这丝毫也不关心似的。弗洛伦斯也许会想，她是傲慢的和无精打采的，但是她对待她却从来不曾这样，因此弗洛伦斯每当感到不可思议时，她就怀着感谢的心情把她的这种诧异压下去，并很快地克服了它。\n 这个星期过得更快了。它几乎是长着翅膀飞过去的。这星期的最后一夜，结婚前的一夜来临了。房间里仍然是黑暗的，因为斯丘顿夫人的头痛还没有好，虽然她希望明天能永远消除这个病症。在房间里的是斯丘顿夫人，伊迪丝和董贝先生。伊迪丝又坐在打开的窗子旁边，望着外面的街道；董贝先生和克利奥佩特拉坐在沙发上低声谈话。时间已经很晚了，弗洛伦斯觉得疲累，已经去睡觉了。\n “我亲爱的董贝，”克利奥佩特拉说道，“\n \n
