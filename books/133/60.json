{"id":3808,"no":60,"title":"Chapter 60","content":"Chiefly Matrimonial\\n\\n The grand half-yearly festival holden by Doctor and Mrs Blimber, on which occasion they requested the pleasure of the company of every young gentleman pursuing his studies in that genteel establishment, at an early party, when the hour was half-past seven o\u0027clock, and when the object was quadrilles, had duly taken place, about this time; and the young gentlemen, with no unbecoming demonstrations of levity, had betaken themselves, in a state of scholastic repletion, to their own homes. Mr Skettles had repaired abroad, permanently to grace the establishment of his father Sir Barnet Skettles, whose popular manners had obtained him a diplomatic appointment, the honours of which were discharged by himself and Lady Skettles, to the satisfaction even of their own countrymen and countrywomen: which was considered almost miraculous. Mr Tozer, now a young man of lofty stature, in Wellington boots, was so extremely full of antiquity as to be nearly on a par with a genuine ancient Roman in his knowledge of English: a triumph that affected his good parents with the tenderest emotions, and caused the father and mother of Mr Briggs (whose learning, like ill-arranged luggage, was so tightly packed that he couldn\u0027t get at anything he wanted) to hide their diminished heads. The fruit laboriously gathered from the tree of knowledge by this latter young gentleman, in fact, had been subjected to so much pressure, that it had become a kind of intellectual Norfolk Biffin, and had nothing of its original form or flavour remaining. Master Bitherstone now, on whom the forcing system had the happier and not uncommon effect of leaving no impression whatever, when the forcing apparatus ceased to work, was in a much more comfortable plight; and being then on shipboard, bound for Bengal, found himself forgetting, with such admirable rapidity, that it was doubtful whether his declensions of noun-substantives would hold out to the end of the voyage.\\n\\n When Doctor Blimber, in pursuance of the usual course, would have said to the young gentlemen, on the morning of the party, \u0027Gentlemen, we will resume our studies on the twenty-fifth of next month,\u0027 he departed from the usual course, and said, \u0027Gentlemen, when our friend Cincinnatus retired to his farm, he did not present to the senate any Roman who he sought to nominate as his successor.\u0027 But there is a Roman here,\u0027 said Doctor Blimber, laying his hand on the shoulder of Mr Feeder, B.A., adolescens imprimis gravis et doctus, gentlemen, whom I, a retiring Cincinnatus, wish to present to my little senate, as their future Dictator. Gentlemen, we will resume our studies on the twenty-fifth of next month, under the auspices of Mr Feeder, B.A.\u0027 At this (which Doctor Blimber had previously called upon all the parents, and urbanely explained), the young gentlemen cheered; and Mr Tozer, on behalf of the rest, instantly presented the Doctor with a silver inkstand, in a speech containing very little of the mother-tongue, but fifteen quotations from the Latin, and seven from the Greek, which moved the younger of the young gentlemen to discontent and envy: they remarking, \u0027Oh, ah. It was all very well for old Tozer, but they didn\u0027t subscribe money for old Tozer to show off with, they supposed; did they? What business was it of old Tozer\u0027s more than anybody else\u0027s? It wasn\u0027t his inkstand. Why couldn\u0027t he leave the boys\u0027 property alone?\u0027 and murmuring other expressions of their dissatisfaction, which seemed to find a greater relief in calling him old Tozer, than in any other available vent.\\n\\n Not a word had been said to the young gentlemen, nor a hint dropped, of anything like a contemplated marriage between Mr Feeder, B.A., and the fair Cornelia Blimber. Doctor Blimber, especially, seemed to take pains to look as if nothing would surprise him more; but it was perfectly well known to all the young gentlemen nevertheless, and when they departed for the society of their relations and friends, they took leave of Mr Feeder with awe.\\n\\n Mr Feeder\u0027s most romantic visions were fulfilled. The Doctor had determined to paint the house outside, and put it in thorough repair; and to give up the business, and to give up Cornelia. The painting and repairing began upon the very day of the young gentlemen\u0027s departure, and now behold! the wedding morning was come, and Cornelia, in a new pair of spectacles, was waiting to be led to the hymeneal altar.\\n\\n The Doctor with his learned legs, and Mrs Blimber in a lilac bonnet, and Mr Feeder, B.A., with his long knuckles and his bristly head of hair, and Mr Feeder\u0027s brother, the Reverend Alfred Feeder, M.A., who was to perform the ceremony, were all assembled in the drawing-room, and Cornelia with her orange-flowers and bridesmaids had just come down, and looked, as of old, a little squeezed in appearance, but very charming, when the door opened, and the weak-eyed young man, in a loud voice, made the following proclamation:\\n\\n \u0027MR AND MRS TOOTS!\u0027\\n\\n Upon which there entered Mr Toots, grown extremely stout, and on his arm a lady very handsomely and becomingly dressed, with very bright black eyes. \u0027Mrs Blimber,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027allow me to present my wife.\u0027\\n\\n Mrs Blimber was delighted to receive her. Mrs Blimber was a little condescending, but extremely kind.\\n\\n \u0027And as you\u0027ve known me for a long time, you know,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027let me assure you that she is one of the most remarkable women that ever lived.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My dear!\u0027 remonstrated Mrs Toots.\\n\\n \u0027Upon my word and honour she is,\u0027 said Mr Toots. \u0027I - I assure you, Mrs Blimber, she\u0027s a most extraordinary woman.\u0027\\n\\n Mrs Toots laughed merrily, and Mrs Blimber led her to Cornelia. Mr Toots having paid his respects in that direction and having saluted his old preceptor, who said, in allusion to his conjugal state, \u0027Well, Toots, well, Toots! So you are one of us, are you, Toots?\u0027 - retired with Mr Feeder, B.A., into a window.\\n\\n Mr Feeder, B.A., being in great spirits, made a spar at Mr Toots, and tapped him skilfully with the back of his hand on the breastbone.\\n\\n \u0027Well, old Buck!\u0027 said Mr Feeder with a laugh. \u0027Well! Here we are! Taken in and done for. Eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Feeder,\u0027 returned Mr Toots. \u0027I give you joy. If you\u0027re as - as- as perfectly blissful in a matrimonial life, as I am myself, you\u0027ll have nothing to desire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t forget my old friends, you see,\u0027 said Mr Feeder. \u0027I ask em to my wedding, Toots.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Feeder,\u0027 replied Mr Toots gravely, \u0027the fact is, that there were several circumstances which prevented me from communicating with you until after my marriage had been solemnised. In the first place, I had made a perfect Brute of myself to you, on the subject of Miss Dombey; and I felt that if you were asked to any wedding of mine, you would naturally expect that it was with Miss Dombey, which involved explanations, that upon my word and honour, at that crisis, would have knocked me completely over. In the second place, our wedding was strictly private; there being nobody present but one friend of myself and Mrs Toots\u0027s, who is a Captain in - I don\u0027t exactly know in what,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027but it\u0027s of no consequence. I hope, Feeder, that in writing a statement of what had occurred before Mrs Toots and myself went abroad upon our foreign tour, I fully discharged the offices of friendship.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Toots, my boy,\u0027 said Mr Feeder, shaking his hands, \u0027I was joking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And now, Feeder,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027I should be glad to know what you think of my union.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Capital!\u0027 returned Mr Feeder.\\n\\n \u0027You think it\u0027s capital, do you, Feeder?\u0027said Mr Toots solemnly. \u0027Then how capital must it be to Me! For you can never know what an extraordinary woman that is.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Feeder was willing to take it for granted. But Mr Toots shook his head, and wouldn\u0027t hear of that being possible.\\n\\n \u0027You see,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027what I wanted in a wife was - in short, was sense. Money, Feeder, I had. Sense I - I had not, particularly.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Feeder murmured, \u0027Oh, yes, you had, Toots!\u0027 But Mr Toots said:\\n\\n \u0027No, Feeder, I had not. Why should I disguise it? I had not. I knew that sense was There,\u0027 said Mr Toots, stretching out his hand towards his wife, \u0027in perfect heaps. I had no relation to object or be offended, on the score of station; for I had no relation. I have never had anybody belonging to me but my guardian, and him, Feeder, I have always considered as a Pirate and a Corsair. Therefore, you know it was not likely,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027that I should take his opinion.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Mr Feeder.\\n\\n \u0027Accordingly,\u0027 resumed Mr Toots, \u0027I acted on my own. Bright was the day on which I did so! Feeder! Nobody but myself can tell what the capacity of that woman\u0027s mind is. If ever the Rights of Women, and all that kind of thing, are properly attended to, it will be through her powerful intellect - Susan, my dear!\u0027 said Mr Toots, looking abruptly out of the windows \u0027pray do not exert yourself!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My dear,\u0027 said Mrs Toots, \u0027I was only talking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But, my love,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027pray do not exert yourself. You really must be careful. Do not, my dear Susan, exert yourself. She\u0027s so easily excited,\u0027 said Mr Toots, apart to Mrs Blimber, \u0027and then she forgets the medical man altogether.\u0027\\n\\n Mrs Blimber was impressing on Mrs Toots the necessity of caution, when Mr Feeder, B.A., offered her his arm, and led her down to the carriages that were waiting to go to church. Doctor Blimber escorted Mrs Toots. Mr Toots escorted the fair bride, around whose lambent spectacles two gauzy little bridesmaids fluttered like moths. Mr Feeder\u0027s brother, Mr Alfred Feeder, M.A., had already gone on, in advance, to assume his official functions.\\n\\n The ceremony was performed in an admirable manner. Cornelia, with her crisp little curls, \u0027went in,\u0027 as the Chicken might have said, with great composure; and Doctor Blimber gave her away, like a man who had quite made up his mind to it. The gauzy little bridesmaids appeared to suffer most. Mrs Blimber was affected, but gently so; and told the Reverend Mr Alfred Feeder, M.A., on the way home, that if she could only have seen Cicero in his retirement at Tusculum, she would not have had a wish, now, ungratified.\\n\\n There was a breakfast afterwards, limited to the same small party; at which the spirits of Mr Feeder, B.A., were tremendous, and so communicated themselves to Mrs Toots that Mr Toots was several times heard to observe, across the table, \u0027My dear Susan, don\u0027t exert yourself!\u0027 The best of it was, that Mr Toots felt it incunbent on him to make a speech; and in spite of a whole code of telegraphic dissuasions from Mrs Toots, appeared on his legs for the first time in his life.\\n\\n \u0027I really,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027in this house, where whatever was done to me in the way of - of any mental confusion sometimes - which is of no consequence and I impute to nobody - I was always treated like one of Doctor Blimber\u0027s family, and had a desk to myself for a considerable period - can - not - allow - my friend Feeder to be - \u0027\\n\\n Mrs Toots suggested \u0027married.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It may not be inappropriate to the occasion, or altogether uninteresting,\u0027 said Mr Toots with a delighted face, \u0027to observe that my wife is a most extraordinary woman, and would do this much better than myself - allow my friend Feeder to be married - especially to - \u0027\\n\\n Mrs Toots suggested \u0027to Miss Blimber.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To Mrs Feeder, my love!\u0027 said Mr Toots, in a subdued tone of private discussion: \"\u0027whom God hath joined,\" you know, \"let no man\" - don\u0027t you know? I cannot allow my friend Feeder to be married - especially to Mrs Feeder - without proposing their - their - Toasts; and may,\u0027 said Mr Toots, fixing his eyes on his wife, as if for inspiration in a high flight, \u0027may the torch of Hymen be the beacon of joy, and may the flowers we have this day strewed in their path, be the - the banishers of- of gloom!\u0027\\n\\n Doctor Blimber, who had a taste for metaphor, was pleased with this, and said, \u0027Very good, Toots! Very well said, indeed, Toots!\u0027 and nodded his head and patted his hands. Mr Feeder made in reply, a comic speech chequered with sentiment. Mr Alfred Feeder, M.A, was afterwards very happy on Doctor and Mrs Blimber; Mr Feeder, B.A., scarcely less so, on the gauzy little bridesmaids. Doctor Blimber then, in a sonorous voice, delivered a few thoughts in the pastoral style, relative to the rushes among which it was the intention of himself and Mrs Blimber to dwell, and the bee that would hum around their cot. Shortly after which, as the Doctor\u0027s eyes were twinkling in a remarkable manner, and his son-in-law had already observed that time was made for slaves, and had inquired whether Mrs Toots sang, the discreet Mrs Blimber dissolved the sitting, and sent Cornelia away, very cool and comfortable, in a post-chaise, with the man of her heart\\n\\n Mr and Mrs Toots withdrew to the Bedford (Mrs Toots had been there before in old times, under her maiden name of Nipper), and there found a letter, which it took Mr Toots such an enormous time to read, that Mrs Toots was frightened.\\n\\n \u0027My dear Susan,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027fright is worse than exertion. Pray be calm!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who is it from?\u0027 asked Mrs Toots.\\n\\n \u0027Why, my love,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027it\u0027s from Captain Gills. Do not excite yourself. Walters and Miss Dombey are expected home!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My dear,\u0027 said Mrs Toots, raising herself quickly from the sofa, very pale, \u0027don\u0027t try to deceive me, for it\u0027s no use, they\u0027re come home - I see it plainly in your face!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s a most extraordinary woman!\u0027 exclaimed Mr Toots, in rapturous admiration. \u0027You\u0027re perfectly right, my love, they have come home. Miss Dombey has seen her father, and they are reconciled!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Reconciled!\u0027 cried Mrs Toots, clapping her hands.\\n\\n \u0027My dear,\u0027 said Mr Toots; \u0027pray do not exert yourself. Do remember the medical man! Captain Gills says - at least he don\u0027t say, but I imagine, from what I can make out, he means - that Miss Dombey has brought her unfortunate father away from his old house, to one where she and Walters are living; that he is lying very ill there - supposed to be dying; and that she attends upon him night and day.\u0027\\n\\n Mrs Toots began to cry quite bitterly.\\n\\n \u0027My dearest Susan,\u0027 replied Mr Toots, \u0027do, do, if you possibly can, remember the medical man! If you can\u0027t, it\u0027s of no consequence - but do endeavour to!\u0027\\n\\n His wife, with her old manner suddenly restored, so pathetically entreated him to take her to her precious pet, her little mistress, her own darling, and the like, that Mr Toots, whose sympathy and admiration were of the strongest kind, consented from his very heart of hearts; and they agreed to depart immediately, and present themselves in answer to the Captain\u0027s letter.\\n\\n Now some hidden sympathies of things, or some coincidences, had that day brought the Captain himself (toward whom Mr and Mrs Toots were soon journeying) into the flowery train of wedlock; not as a principal, but as an accessory. It happened accidentally, and thus:\\n\\n The Captain, having seen Florence and her baby for a moment, to his unbounded content, and having had a long talk with Walter, turned out for a walk; feeling it necessary to have some solitary meditation on the changes of human affairs, and to shake his glazed hat profoundly over the fall of Mr Dombey, for whom the generosity and simplicity of his nature were awakened in a lively manner. The Captain would have been very low, indeed, on the unhappy gentleman\u0027s account, but for the recollection of the baby; which afforded him such intense satisfaction whenever it arose, that he laughed aloud as he went along the street, and, indeed, more than once, in a sudden impulse of joy, threw up his glazed hat and caught it again; much to the amazement of the spectators. The rapid alternations of light and shade to which these two conflicting subjects of reflection exposed the Captain, were so very trying to his spirits, that he felt a long walk necessary to his composure; and as there is a great deal in the influence of harmonious associations, he chose, for the scene of this walk, his old neighbourhood, down among the mast, oar, and block makers, ship-biscuit bakers, coal-whippers, pitch-kettles, sailors, canals, docks, swing-bridges, and other soothing objects.\\n\\n These peaceful scenes, and particularly the region of Limehouse Hole and thereabouts, were so influential in calming the Captain, that he walked on with restored tranquillity, and was, in fact, regaling himself, under his breath, with the ballad of Lovely Peg, when, on turning a corner, he was suddenly transfixed and rendered speechless by a triumphant procession that he beheld advancing towards him.\\n\\n This awful demonstration was headed by that determined woman Mrs MacStinger, who, preserving a countenance of inexorable resolution, and wearing conspicuously attached to her obdurate bosom a stupendous watch and appendages, which the Captain recognised at a glance as the property of Bunsby, conducted under her arm no other than that sagacious mariner; he, with the distraught and melancholy visage of a captive borne into a foreign land, meekly resigning himself to her will. Behind them appeared the young MacStingers, in a body, exulting. Behind them, M~ two ladies of a terrible and steadfast aspect, leading between them a short gentleman in a tall hat, who likewise exulted. In the wake, appeared Bunsby\u0027s boy, bearing umbrellas. The whole were in good marching order; and a dreadful smartness that pervaded the party would have sufficiently announced, if the intrepid countenances of the ladies had been wanting, that it was a procession of sacrifice, and that the victim was Bunsby.\\n\\n The first impulse of the Captain was to run away. This also appeared to be the first impulse of Bunsby, hopeless as its execution must have proved. But a cry of recognition proceeding from the party, and Alexander MacStinger running up to the Captain with open arms, the Captain struck.\\n\\n \u0027Well, Cap\u0027en Cuttle!\u0027 said Mrs MacStinger. \u0027This is indeed a meeting! I bear no malice now, Cap\u0027en Cuttle - you needn\u0027t fear that I\u0027m a going to cast any reflections. I hope to go to the altar in another spirit.\u0027 Here Mrs MacStinger paused, and drawing herself up, and inflating her bosom with a long breath, said, in allusion to the victim, \u0027My \u0027usband, Cap\u0027en Cuttle!\u0027\\n\\n The abject Bunsby looked neither to the right nor to the left, nor at his bride, nor at his friend, but straight before him at nothing. The Captain putting out his hand, Bunsby put out his; but, in answer to the Captain\u0027s greeting, spake no word.\\n\\n \u0027Cap\u0027en Cuttle,\u0027 said Mrs MacStinger, \u0027if you would wish to heal up past animosities, and to see the last of your friend, my \u0027usband, as a single person, we should be \u0027appy of your company to chapel. Here is a lady here,\u0027 said Mrs MacStinger, turning round to the more intrepid of the two, \u0027my bridesmaid, that will be glad of your protection, Cap\u0027en Cuttle.\u0027\\n\\n The short gentleman in the tall hat, who it appeared was the husband of the other lady, and who evidently exulted at the reduction of a fellow creature to his own condition, gave place at this, and resigned the lady to Captain Cuttle. The lady immediately seized him, and, observing that there was no time to lose, gave the word, in a strong voice, to advance.\\n\\n The Captain\u0027s concern for his friend, not unmingled, at first, with some concern for himself - for a shadowy terror that he might be married by violence, possessed him, until his knowledge of the service came to his relief, and remembering the legal obligation of saying, \u0027I will,\u0027 he felt himself personally safe so long as he resolved, if asked any question, distinctly to reply I won\u0027t\u0027 - threw him into a profuse perspiration; and rendered him, for a time, insensible to the movements of the procession, of which he now formed a feature, and to the conversation of his fair companion. But as he became less agitated, he learnt from this lady that she was the widow of a Mr Bokum, who had held an employment in the Custom House; that she was the dearest friend of Mrs MacStinger, whom she considered a pattern for her sex; that she had often heard of the Captain, and now hoped he had repented of his past life; that she trusted Mr Bunsby knew what a blessing he had gained, but that she feared men seldom did know what such blessings were, until they had lost them; with more to the same purpose.\\n\\n All this time, the Captain could not but observe that Mrs Bokum kept her eyes steadily on the bridegroom, and that whenever they came near a court or other narrow turning which appeared favourable for flight, she was on the alert to cut him off if he attempted escape. The other lady, too, as well as her husband, the short gentleman with the tall hat, were plainly on guard, according to a preconcerted plan; and the wretched man was so secured by Mrs MacStinger, that any effort at self-preservation by flight was rendered futile. This, indeed, was apparent to the mere populace, who expressed their perception of the fact by jeers and cries; to all of which, the dread MacStinger was inflexibly indifferent, while Bunsby himself appeared in a state of unconsciousness.\\n\\n The Captain made many attempts to accost the philosopher, if only in a monosyllable or a signal; but always failed, in consequence of the vigilance of the guard, and the difficulty, at all times peculiar to Bunsby\u0027s constitution, of having his attention aroused by any outward and visible sign whatever. Thus they approached the chapel, a neat whitewashed edifice, recently engaged by the Reverend Melchisedech Howler, who had consented, on very urgent solicitation, to give the world another two years of existence, but had informed his followers that, then, it must positively go.\\n\\n While the Reverend Melchisedech was offering up some extemporary orisons, the Captain found an opportunity of growling in the bridegroom\u0027s ear:\\n\\n \u0027What cheer, my lad, what cheer?\u0027\\n\\n To which Bunsby replied, with a forgetfulness of the Reverend Melchisedech, which nothing but his desperate circumstances could have excused:\\n\\n \u0027D-----d bad,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jack Bunsby,\u0027 whispered the Captain, \u0027do you do this here, of your own free will?\u0027\\n\\n Mr Bunsby answered \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you do it, then, my lad?\u0027 inquired the Captain, not unnaturally.\\n\\n Bunsby, still looking, and always looking with an immovable countenance, at the opposite side of the world, made no reply.\\n\\n \u0027Why not sheer off?\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027Eh?\u0027 whispered Bunsby, with a momentary gleam of hope. \u0027Sheer off,\u0027 said the Captain.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s the good?\u0027 retorted the forlorn sage. \u0027She\u0027d capter me agen.\\n\\n \u0027Try!\u0027 replied the Captain. \u0027Cheer up! Come! Now\u0027s your time. Sheer off, Jack Bunsby!\u0027\\n\\n Jack Bunsby, however, instead of profiting by the advice, said in a doleful whisper:\\n\\n \u0027It all began in that there chest o\u0027 yourn. Why did I ever conwoy her into port that night?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My lad,\u0027 faltered the Captain, \u0027I thought as you had come over her; not as she had come over you. A man as has got such opinions as you have!\u0027\\n\\n Mr Bunsby merely uttered a suppressed groan.\\n\\n \u0027Come!\u0027 said the Captain, nudging him with his elbow, \u0027now\u0027s your time! Sheer off! I\u0027ll cover your retreat. The time\u0027s a flying. Bunsby! It\u0027s for liberty. Will you once?\u0027\\n\\n Bunsby was immovable. \u0027Bunsby!\u0027 whispered the Captain, \u0027will you twice ?\u0027 Bunsby wouldn\u0027t twice.\\n\\n \u0027Bunsby!\u0027 urged the Captain, \u0027it\u0027s for liberty; will you three times? Now or never!\u0027\\n\\n Bunsby didn\u0027t then, and didn\u0027t ever; for Mrs MacStinger immediately afterwards married him.\\n\\n One of the most frightful circumstances of the ceremony to the Captain, was the deadly interest exhibited therein by Juliana MacStinger; and the fatal concentration of her faculties, with which that promising child, already the image of her parent, observed the whole proceedings. The Captain saw in this a succession of man-traps stretching out infinitely; a series of ages of oppression and coercion, through which the seafaring line was doomed. It was a more memorable sight than the unflinching steadiness of Mrs Bokum and the other lady, the exultation of the short gentleman in the tall hat, or even the fell inflexibility of Mrs MacStinger. The Master MacStingers understood little of what was going on, and cared less; being chiefly engaged, during the ceremony, in treading on one another\u0027s half-boots; but the contrast afforded by those wretched infants only set off and adorned the precocious woman in Juliana. Another year or two, the Captain thought, and to lodge where that child was, would be destruction.\\n\\n The ceremony was concluded by a general spring of the young family on Mr Bunsby, whom they hailed by the endearing name of father, and from whom they solicited half-pence. These gushes of affection over, the procession was about to issue forth again, when it was delayed for some little time by an unexpected transport on the part of Alexander MacStinger. That dear child, it seemed, connecting a chapel with tombstones, when it was entered for any purpose apart from the ordinary religious exercises, could not be persuaded but that his mother was now to be decently interred, and lost to him for ever. In the anguish of this conviction, he screamed with astonishing force, and turned black in the face. However touching these marks of a tender disposition were to his mother, it was not in the character of that remarkable woman to permit her recognition of them to degenerate into weakness. Therefore, after vainly endeavouring to convince his reason by shakes, pokes, bawlings-out, and similar applications to his head, she led him into the air, and tried another method; which was manifested to the marriage party by a quick succession of sharp sounds, resembling applause, and subsequently, by their seeing Alexander in contact with the coolest paving-stone in the court, greatly flushed, and loudly lamenting.\\n\\n The procession being then in a condition to form itself once more, and repair to Brig Place, where a marriage feast was in readiness, returned as it had come; not without the receipt, by Bunsby, of many humorous congratulations from the populace on his recently-acquired happiness. The Captain accompanied it as far as the house-door, but, being made uneasy by the gentler manner of Mrs Bokum, who, now that she was relieved from her engrossing duty - for the watchfulness and alacrity of the ladies sensibly diminished when the bridegroom was safely married - had greater leisure to show an interest in his behalf, there left it and the captive; faintly pleading an appointment, and promising to return presently. The Captain had another cause for uneasiness, in remorsefully reflecting that he had been the first means of Bunsby\u0027s entrapment, though certainly without intending it, and through his unbounded faith in the resources of that philosopher.\\n\\n To go back to old Sol Gills at the wooden Midshipman\u0027s, and not first go round to ask how Mr Dombey was - albeit the house where he lay was out of London, and away on the borders of a fresh heath - was quite out of the Captain\u0027s course. So he got a lift when he was tired, and made out the journey gaily.\\n\\n The blinds were pulled down, and the house so quiet, that the Captain was almost afraid to knock; but listening at the door, he heard low voices within, very near it, and, knocking softly, was admitted by Mr Toots. Mr Toots and his wife had, in fact, just arrived there; having been at the Midshipman\u0027s to seek him, and having there obtained the address.\\n\\n They were not so recently arrived, but that Mrs Toots had caught the baby from somebody, taken it in her arms, and sat down on the stairs, hugging and fondling it. Florence was stooping down beside her; and no one could have said which Mrs Toots was hugging and fondling most, the mother or the child, or which was the tenderer, Florence of Mrs Toots, or Mrs Toots of her, or both of the baby; it was such a little group of love and agitation.\\n\\n \u0027And is your Pa very ill, my darling dear Miss Floy?\u0027 asked Susan.\\n\\n \u0027He is very, very ill,\u0027 said Florence. \u0027But, Susan, dear, you must not speak to me as you used to speak. And what\u0027s this?\u0027 said Florence, touching her clothes, in amazement. \u0027Your old dress, dear? Your old cap, curls, and all?\u0027\\n\\n Susan burst into tears, and showered kisses on the little hand that had touched her so wonderingly.\\n\\n \u0027My dear Miss Dombey,\u0027 said Mr Toots, stepping forward, \u0027I\u0027ll explain. She\u0027s the most extraordinary woman. There are not many to equal her! She has always said - she said before we were married, and has said to this day - that whenever you came home, she\u0027d come to you in no dress but the dress she used to serve you in, for fear she might seem strange to you, and you might like her less. I admire the dress myself,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027of all things. I adore her in it! My dear Miss Dombey, she\u0027ll be your maid again, your nurse, all that she ever was, and more. There\u0027s no change in her. But, Susan, my dear,\u0027 said Mr Toots, who had spoken with great feeling and high admiration, \u0027all I ask is, that you\u0027ll remember the medical man, and not exert yourself too much!\u0027\\n\\n 布林伯博士和夫人每半年举行一次隆重的庆祝典礼，他们恭请在那所高贵的学校中学习的每一位年轻的先生们光临一个早晚会，7点半开始，在晚会上举行四对舞，大约在这个时候，这个庆祝典礼已经按时举行过了；这些年轻的先生们没有轻浮地表露出任何不得体的狂喜，已装满一肚子学问，回到自己家里去。斯凯特尔斯先生这时已前往国外，为他的家庭永远增光；他的父亲巴尼特·斯凯特尔斯爵士由于深孚众望的举止风度，被任命为一个外交官，他和斯凯特尔斯夫人一起履行着这个光荣的职务，甚至他们本国的男同胞们和女同胞们都感到满意，这一点大家都认为几乎是一个奇迹。托泽先生现在是一位身材高大的年轻人，穿着惠灵顿长靴，脑子里装满了古代的风习制度，因而他在英语知识方面只跟一位真正的古代的罗马人不相上下；他在古代风习制度方面所取得的这个了不起的成就使他善良的双亲深受感动，也使布里格斯先生的父母把他们羞愧的脸孔掩藏起来；布里格斯先生的学识，就像整理得不好的行李，捆扎得很紧，因此他无法取得他想要得到的任何东西。这位年轻的先生从知识树上费力采集的果实由于事实上受到过很大的压力，因此它已变成一种智力上的诺福克苹果饼①，完全失去了原先的形状与滋味。比瑟斯通少爷的不幸境况现在要好受得多；当高压的机器停止工作时，它在他身上没有留下任何压痕，这是这个高压制度在他身上所产生的比较令人高兴的、不是罕见的效果；这时他正在开往孟加拉的船上，感到自己正以惊人的速度丧失记忆力；他脑子中名词词形变化的知识是否能保持到旅途终点，这是可疑的。\\n\\n 按照惯例，在举行晚会的那天早上，布林伯博士本来会向年轻的先生们说，“先生们，我们将在下个月的二十五日重新开始我们的学习”；但是他却打破了惯例，说，“先生们，当我们的朋友辛辛纳图斯②退隐到他的农庄去时，他没有向元老院提名任何罗马人作为他的继承人。但是这里有一位罗马人，”布林伯博士把手搁在文学士菲德先生的肩膀上说，“adolescensimprimisgravisetdoc－tus③，先生们，我，一个退隐的辛辛纳图斯，希望向我的小元老院提名他为他们未来的执政官。先生们，我们将在下个月的二十五日在文学士菲德先生的主持下，重新开始我们的学习。”布林伯博士事先曾拜访过所有的父母们，并彬彬有礼地向他们解释过这件事。年轻的先生们听他发表了这番讲话后，都发出欢呼。托泽先生代表所有的学生们，立即向博士赠送了一个银制的墨水台，并发表了一篇讲话，讲话中很少使用本国语言，但却包含了十五个拉丁语的引用语和七个希腊语的引用语；年轻的先生们当中那些年龄比较小的人对这感到不满和妒嫉，他们说，“嘿，您瞧！这对老托泽来说倒是怪不错的，但要知道他们捐出钱来并不是让老托泽卖弄自己的，是不是？老托泽为什么要与其他人不同？这又不是他的墨水台。为什么他不能把大家的财产放在那里就此了事？”他们还嘀咕着其他表示不满的话，似乎觉得称他为“老托泽”比采用其他出气的方式能得到更大的安慰。\\n\\n --------\\n\\n ①诺福克苹果饼（NorfolkBiffin）：把苹果压成扁平、进行烘烤后做成的饼，它主要是在英格兰东岸的诺福克郡产生的。\\n\\n ②辛辛纳图斯（LuciusQuinctiusCincinatus，公元前519？——？年）：罗马政治家；他的事迹带有神秘色彩。根据历史传说，公元前458年，他被罗马城居民推举为执政官，让他去救援被埃魁人（Aegui）围困于阿尔基多斯山（Mt．Algidus）上由一位执政官率领的军队；他接到此项任命时，正在自己的小农庄上耕作；据说他在一天之内就打败了敌军，在罗马举行了凯旋式。辛辛纳图斯限定自己仅仅在领导罗马度过危机时期掌权；危机刚一解除，他便辞职返回农庄。\\n\\n ③（拉丁文）：一位极为庄重和有学问的年轻人。\\n\\n 文学士菲德先生与美丽的科妮莉亚·布林伯即将结婚这件事没有向年轻的先生们说过一个字，也没有作出过一点暗示。特别是布林伯博士，他似乎竭力装出一副仿佛没有什么消息能比这更会使他感到吃惊的神态；可是尽管如此，年轻的先生们都完全知道这个消息了；当他们离开学校前去与他们的亲属与朋友团聚时，他们都怀着敬畏的心情去跟菲德先生告别。\\n\\n 菲德先生极为浪漫的梦想实现了。博士决定把房屋的外面油漆一新，并彻底进行修理；也决定交出他的事业和科妮莉亚。年轻的先生们离开学校的那一天，油漆与修理工作就已开始了，现在请看！举行婚礼的这天早晨来临了，科妮莉亚戴着一副新眼镜，正等待着被领到结婚的圣坛那里去。\\n\\n 博士跨着博学的双腿；布林伯夫人戴着淡紫色的软帽；文学士菲德先生有着长长的指节和竖立的头发；菲德先生的哥哥、文硕士艾尔弗雷德大师将执掌婚礼；他们全都聚集在客厅里。科妮莉亚拿着香橙花，跟她的女傧相刚刚走下楼来，像过去一样，看上去腰身被勒得有些紧窄，但很迷人；这时门开了，那位弱视的年轻人用洪亮的通报道：\\n\\n “图茨先生与夫人！”\\n\\n “这时，长得非常肥胖的图茨先生进来了；挽着他的胳膊的是一位穿着漂亮而又得体的衣服、并有一双很明亮的黑眼睛的女士。\\n\\n “布林伯夫人，”图茨先生说道，“请允许我介绍我的妻子。”\\n\\n 布林伯夫人高兴地接待了她。布林伯夫人稍稍有点降尊纡贵的神气，但却非常客气。\\n\\n “因为您了解我已很久了，”图茨先生说道，“那就让我来肯定地对您说，她是世界上极了不起的女人之一。”\\n\\n “我亲爱的，”图茨夫人表示异议地说道。\\n\\n “说实话，我以荣誉发誓，她是这样的，”图茨先生说道。\\n\\n “我——我肯定地对您说，布林伯夫人，她是一位极了不起的女人。”\\n\\n 图茨夫人愉快地大笑着；布林伯夫人把她领到科妮莉亚跟前。图茨先生向那个方向表示了敬意，并向他过去的导师致敬，他的导师暗示他的婚姻状况，说，“很好，图茨，很好，图茨！所以您是我们当中的一个了，是不是，图茨？”然后，图茨先生就跟文学士菲德先生离开大家，走到窗口。\\n\\n 文学士菲德先生兴致勃勃，摆出拳击的姿态，向图茨先生打了一拳，手背灵巧地轻打在他的胸骨上。\\n\\n “唔，老伙计！”菲德先生大笑一声，说道。“这正是我们所要的！说了就做。对吧！”\\n\\n “菲德，”图茨先生回答道。“我向您祝贺。如果您在夫妇生活中像我一样非常幸福，那么您就不会再需要什么了。”\\n\\n “我不会忘记我的老朋友，您看，”菲德先生说道，“我请他们来参加我的婚礼，图茨。”\\n\\n “菲德，”图茨郑重其事地回答道，“事实是，有一些情况妨碍我在举行婚礼之前跟您通信。首先，我过去跟您谈到董贝小姐的时候，我自己真成了一条畜牲。我觉得，如果我请您参加我的婚礼的话，那么您自然会以为我是跟董贝小姐结婚；那样一来就要进行好多解释；说实话，以我的荣誉发誓，在那个关键时刻，那样做就会使我感到非常痛苦！第二，我们的婚礼完全是悄悄举行的，除了我和图茨夫人的一位朋友外，没有其他人参加；这位朋友是一位船长，我不清楚他是在那里工作的，”图茨先生说道，“但这无关紧要。菲德，图茨夫人和我本人出国旅游之前，我曾写信把发生的事情告诉了您；我希望，我这样做已完全尽到一位朋友的责任了。”\\n\\n “图茨，我的朋友，”菲德先生握握他的手，说道，“我是跟您开玩笑。”\\n\\n “现在，菲德，”图茨先生说道，“我将高兴地了解一下您对我的婚姻有什么看法。”\\n\\n “好极了！”菲德先生回答道。\\n\\n “您认为好极了，是不是，菲德？”图茨先生一本正经地说道。“那么我更该认为它好极了！因为您永远也不会知道，她是一位多么了不起的女人。”\\n\\n 菲德先生很乐意地认为，这是当然的，不成问题的；但是图茨先生摇摇头，认为菲德先生是不可能知道这一点的。\\n\\n “您知道，”图茨先生说，“我对妻子需要的是，总之，是智慧。钱，我有，菲德，智慧，我——我却格外缺乏。”\\n\\n 菲德先生低声说，“啊，不，您有的，图茨！”可是图茨先生说道：\\n\\n “没有，菲德，我没有。我为什么要假装有？我没有。我知道智慧在那里，”图茨先生伸出手指指他的妻子，“一大堆。我没有任何亲属因为我们的身份不同来反对我的婚姻，或者生我的气，因为我没有亲属；除了我的监护人外，从来没有什么人是属于我的，而这位监护人我一直认为他是一个海盗和海贼。菲德，所以，您知道，”图茨先生说道，“当时我不可能去跟他商量，听他的意见。”\\n\\n “当然，”菲德先生说道。\\n\\n “因此，”图茨先生继续说道，“我是按照我自己的意见来办的。我办这件事的那一天是多么幸福啊！菲德！除了我本人，没有人能知道这女人的脑子有多么聪明。如果有一天人们适当注意妇女的权利或所有这一类的东西的话，那么那将是由于她那高超的智慧才做到的。苏珊，我亲爱的！”图茨先生立刻将眼光从窗帘移开，“请别把你自己搞累了！”\\n\\n “我亲爱的，”图茨夫人说道，“我只是在谈话。”\\n\\n “可是我亲爱的，”图茨先生说道，“请别把自己搞累了。你确实必须小心。我亲爱的苏珊，请别把你自己搞累了。她很容易兴奋，”图茨先生对布林伯夫人说道，“那时她就把医生的话全都忘了。”\\n\\n 布林伯夫人正在开导图茨夫人必须谨慎小心的时候，文学士菲德先生向她伸出手，扶着她下楼到四轮马车那里，那马车正等待着开往教堂去。布林伯博士扶着图茨夫人。图茨先生扶着美丽的新娘，在她闪闪发光的眼镜周围，两位小女傧相穿着轻薄透明的衣衫，像飞蛾一样地飞来飞去。菲德先生的哥哥、文硕士艾尔弗雷德·菲德先生早已先走，以便去执行他的职务。\\n\\n 婚礼进行得非常好。科妮莉亚留着短短的、起着波纹的卷发，十分沉着冷静，就像斗鸡可能会说的，“进场了”。布林伯博士则像是一位下定决心的人那样，把她交给了新郎。两位穿着轻薄透明的衣衫的小女傧相似乎比所有其他的人更感到痛苦。布林伯夫人心情稍稍有点激动，但还是平静的，在回家的路上她跟大师、文硕士艾尔弗雷德先生说，如果她只要能在西塞罗退隐在图斯库卢姆的时候见到他的话，那么她现在就没有一个没有满足的愿望了。\\n\\n 然后是早餐，仍然是同样的一小群人参加。这时文学士菲德先生的情绪极高，而且传播到图茨夫人，因此好几次听到图茨先生越过桌面对她说，“我亲爱的苏珊，别把你自己搞累了！”最妙的是，图茨先生觉得自己义不容辞地需要发表讲话，所以不顾图茨夫人向他发来的一连串劝阻的电报暗码，还是平生第一次站起来致词。\\n\\n “在这个屋子里，”图茨先生说道，“不论在这里做了些什么，有时使我思想混乱，那是无关紧要的，我也不责怪任何人——在这个屋子里大家经常这样对待我，就像我是布林伯博士家庭中的一个成员一样，而且在相当长的一段时间中我还有一张自己的书桌，所以今天——当我的朋友菲德——”\\n\\n 图茨夫人提示道，“结婚。”\\n\\n “可能在这个场合说不是不适当的，或者不是完全没有兴趣的，”图茨先生露出高兴的脸色，说道，“我想说，我的妻子是个了不起的女人，这件事她可能会比我做得更好——今天当我的朋友菲德先生跟——跟——”\\n\\n 图茨夫人提示道，“跟布林伯小姐结婚。”\\n\\n “跟菲德夫人结婚，我亲爱的！”图茨先生用私下讨论的低声说道，“‘上帝已经把他们结合在一起了，’你知道，‘不让一个人’——你不知道吗？今天当我的朋友菲德——特别是跟菲德夫人结婚的时候，我不允许不建议举杯向他们——祝酒，愿，”图茨先生眼睛盯着他的妻子，仿佛在等待灵感迅速飞临似的。“愿婚姻之神的火炬是快乐的灯塔，愿我们今天在他们道路上所撒下的花朵是——消愁释忧的雨露！”布林伯博士是爱好隐喻的，所以听了很高兴，说，“很好，图茨！确实说得很好，图茨！”同时点点头，轻轻地拍拍手。菲德先生发表了一副滑稽好笑，但却充满感情的谈话作答；然后文学硕士艾尔弗雷德·菲德先生祝布林伯博士和夫人非常幸福；文学士菲德先生祝穿着轻薄透明的衣衫的小女傧相同样幸福。然后，布林伯博士用洪亮的、田园诗的风格，发表了他的一些想法，他谈到他本人和布林伯夫人打算居住在灯心草丛中间，还谈到蜜蜂将在他们小屋周围嗡嗡飞鸣。在这之后不久，因为博士的眼睛令人注目地闪烁着亮光，他的女婿已经说过时间是为奴隶们创造的，也已问过图茨夫人是不是要唱歌，所以考虑周到的布林伯夫人就解散了这个聚会，把科妮莉亚跟她的心上人一起送进一个很凉爽很舒适的驿马车中。\\n\\n 图茨先生与夫人离开以后前往贝德福德旅馆（图茨夫人过去当她还是称为尼珀姑娘的时候，曾在那里待过），他们在那里收到一封信；图茨先生花了那么长久的时候念它，图茨夫人都因此感到惊恐了。\\n\\n “我亲爱的苏珊，”图茨先生说道，“惊恐比兴奋更坏。请镇静下来！”\\n\\n “谁写来的信？”图茨夫人问道。\\n\\n “啊，我亲爱的，”图茨先生说道，“这是吉尔斯船长写来的信。别激动。他们正等待着沃尔特斯与董贝小姐回家来！”\\n\\n “我亲爱的，”图茨夫人脸色很苍白，并迅速地从沙发上站起来，说道，“别想欺骗我了，因为那是没有用的。我已在你的脸上看得清清楚楚，他们已经回到家里来了。”\\n\\n “她是个极了不起的女人！”图茨先生欢天喜地，非常钦佩地大声喊道，“你完全说对了，我亲爱的，他们已经回家了。\\n\\n 董贝小姐已经见到了她的父亲，他们已经和好了！”\\n\\n “和好了！”图茨夫人拍着手，喊道。\\n\\n “我亲爱的，”图茨先生说道，“请别把你自己搞累了。请记住医生的话！吉尔斯船长说——他没有直接这么说，不过根据我的理解，我想，他的意思是说——董贝小姐已经把她不幸的父亲从他的老房屋中接出来，接到她与沃尔特斯居住的一个房屋里；还说他躺在那里，病得很重——大概他已垂危，还说她日夜侍候着他。”\\n\\n 图茨夫人开始很悲伤地哭泣。\\n\\n “我最亲爱的苏珊，”图茨先生回答道，“如果你可能的话，那么请，请，请记住医生的话！如果你不能记住的话，那么这是无关紧要的——但还是请您努力把它记住吧！”\\n\\n 她的妻子突然恢复了她过去的态度，非常可怜地恳求他把她带到她的可爱的宝贝、她的小女主人、她的亲爱的人等等那里去；图茨先生对她怀着强烈的同情与钦佩，因此由衷地表示同意；他们一致决定立即出发，亲自出现在船长面前，作为对他来信的答复。\\n\\n 图茨先生与夫人不久就动身到他那里去了。那一天，船长本人出于某种隐秘的同情心，或者由于某些巧合，不是以主要当事人的身份，而是以次要人物的身份，参加了一场隆重的结婚典礼。这件事是这样偶然发生的：\\n\\n 船长对弗洛伦斯与她的婴孩看了一会儿，感到无限满意，又跟沃尔特长时间地谈了话之后，就出去散步；他感到有必要对人们命运的变化独自进行一些思考，并对董贝先生的破家荡产意味深长地挥挥他那顶上了光的帽子；他生性宽厚、纯朴，所以对董贝先生深表同情。是的，要不是回想起那个婴孩的话，那么船长本会因为那位不幸的先生而情绪十分低落的；可是每当那个婴孩的记忆浮现在他心头的时候，他就感到极为高兴，因此当他沿着街道走着的时候，他高声大笑着。确实，在喜悦的突然冲动下，他不止一次把那顶上了光的帽子向上抛去，然后又接住它，使看到这种情景的人都感到十分惊奇。回忆中这两个相互冲突的主题时而把他投向光明，时而又把他投向阴影；这种迅速的交替变化，使他的心情十分难受；因此他觉得需要长时间的散步才能使自己镇静下来。由于赏心悦目的联想能够起很大作用，所以他就决定散步到他往日住所的邻近地区中去，那里住着制造桅、桨和滑车的工匠、烘烤船上硬饼干的师傅，给船装卸煤炭的工人和船员；那里可以看到熬沥青的锅、运河、船坞、旋桥以及其他能给人以安慰的东西。\\n\\n 这些宁静的风景，特别是石灰窑洞及附近的地区，对稳定船长的情绪起了很大的作用；他怀着重新平静的心情，向前走去；实际上，他还低声哼唱着《可爱的佩格姑娘》这支歌曲使自己快活起来；正在这个时候，一支喜气洋洋的队伍向他迎面走来，他看到了这个场面，突然间惊吓得不能动弹，一句话也说不出来。\\n\\n 这支可怕的队伍由那位性格刚毅的女人麦克斯廷杰领头；她保持着她那不屈不挠的坚决的神色，在她那顽固的胸前显眼地佩挂着一只大表和表链坠，船长一眼看出那是邦斯贝的财物。她在胳膊中挽着的不是别人，就是那位智慧超群的海员；他露出一个被解往他乡异国的俘虏的心神错乱、郁郁不乐的表情，逆来顺受地听从她随意摆布。在他们后面的是一群兴高采烈的小麦克斯廷杰们。在他们后面，两位外貌可怕而神色坚定的女士伴随着一位身材矮小的戴大礼帽的先生，他也兴高采烈。在末尾，是邦斯贝的男孩子，扛着好多伞。整个队伍秩序井然地向前行进。即便没有女士们那种勇猛无畏的外貌，这支队伍那种惊人的麻利劲儿也足以宣布，这是一支献祭的队列，祭品就是邦斯贝。\\n\\n 船长的第一个冲动是逃走。这似乎也是邦斯贝的第一个冲动，虽然从实际执行情况来看，这种尝试想必已经证明是毫无希望的。可是从队伍中发出了一声认识船长的喊声，亚历山大·麦克斯廷杰伸出两只胳膊，跑到船长跟前，船长被当场逮住了。\\n\\n “唔，卡特尔船长！”麦克斯廷杰太太说道。“想不到会在这里相遇！我现在对您不怀恶意。卡特尔船长——您不用害怕，我不想提起往事，对您进行指责。我希望以另一种心情走向圣坛。”麦克斯廷杰太太说到这里停了一下，挺直了身体，长长地吸了一口气，她的胸脯因而就膨胀了起来，然后她指指那个祭品说，“这是我的丈夫，卡特尔船长。”\\n\\n 不幸的邦斯贝既没有向右边看，也没有向左边看；既没有看他的新娘，也没有看他的朋友，而是毫无目的地直望着前面。船长伸出手，邦斯贝也伸出了手来，但没有说一句话来回答船长的问候。\\n\\n “卡特尔船长，”麦克斯廷杰太太说道，“如果您希望了结您过去的怨仇，并看看您的朋友，我的丈夫是怎样结束单身汉生活的话，那么我们很高兴您能陪同我们到小教堂去。这里有一位女士，”麦克斯廷杰转向两位女士当中更为勇猛的一位，说道，“她是我的女傧相；有您保护她，她一定会很高兴的，卡特尔船长。”\\n\\n 那位身材矮小的戴大礼帽的先生看来是另一位女士的丈夫；他看到他的一位同胞被降低到跟他同等的身份，显然喜出望外，就让出位子，把那位女士交给卡特尔船长照顾。那位女士立刻抓住他，说，时间不能耽误了，同时高声命令向前走。\\n\\n 船长对他朋友的忧虑最初还夹杂着几分对他自己的忧虑，因为一种惟恐自己也会被强迫结婚的模糊的恐怖使他流出了满身大汗，后来还是他对宗教仪式的知识才把他从这种忧虑中解救了出来。因为他记起只有说了“我愿意”这三个字才能承担法律上的责任，并决定在被问到任何问题的时候都将一清二楚地回答“我不愿意”，因此他就感到自己安全无恙了。在他原先怀有忧虑的情况下，他曾经有一段时间没有感觉到如今他也是其中一员的队伍正在行进，也没有听到他那位女伴的谈话。但当他心情稍稍安定下来以后，他从这位女士那里知道，她是曾经在海关就职的博库姆先生的寡妇，也是麦克斯廷杰太太最亲爱的朋友；她认为麦克斯廷杰太太是她们女性的楷模；她常常听到她谈起船长，希望现在他已悔恨过去所过的生活；她希望邦斯贝先生知道他已获得了何等的幸福，但是她害怕男人在失去这种幸福之前很少知道这种幸福是什么，还谈了其他这一类内容的话。\\n\\n 在所有这些时间中，船长不能不注意到，博库姆太太的眼睛一直牢牢盯着新郎；每当他们走进一个院子或其他便于逃跑的狭窄的转弯处时，她就密切提防着；如果他企图溜脱的话，那么她就切断他的后路。另一位女士，以及她的丈夫，那位身材矮小、戴大礼帽的先生，也按照预定的计划，同样明显地在警戒着；那位可怜的人则被麦克斯廷杰太太牢牢抓紧，任何想要靠逃跑来保全自己的企图都是枉费心机。甚至过路的普通老百姓对这也看得一清二楚，他们发出嘲笑和叫喊来表达他们对这个事实的感受，但可怕的麦克斯廷杰对这一切满不在乎，毫不妥协，邦斯贝本人则好像处在一种不知不觉的状态中。\\n\\n 船长作了好多尝试来跟这位才智出众的人打招呼，哪怕是说一个单音节的词或者是做个手势也好；可是因为守卫人员保持着警惕，也因为邦斯贝一向特殊的性格，难于用任何外面的可见的暗号来引起他的注意，所以他的尝试总是失败。这样他们就到达了小教堂；那是一座整洁的、涂刷了白粉的大建筑物，最近被梅尔奇斯代克·豪勒尔大师租用过；他在大家十分坚持的请求下，同意把世界末日再延长两年，但是他告诉他的信徒们，到那时候，世界肯定要毁灭了。\\n\\n 当梅尔奇斯代克大师正在做一个即席祷告的时候，船长找到一个机会在新郎的耳旁用低沉的说道：\\n\\n “最近的情况怎么样，我的朋友，最近的情况怎么样？”\\n\\n 邦斯贝忘记了梅尔奇斯代克大师（这只能用他的绝望处境来解释），回答道：\\n\\n “糟透了。”\\n\\n “杰克·邦斯贝先生，”船长低声问道：“您到这里来是出于您的自愿吗？”\\n\\n 邦斯贝先生回答道，“不是。”\\n\\n “那么您为什么要到这里来，我的朋友？”船长自然而然地提出了这个问题。\\n\\n 邦斯贝仍然在看着，而且一直以呆板的神情看着这个世界的对面，没有回答。\\n\\n “为什么不掉转船头，离开航道？”船长问道。\\n\\n “嗯？”邦斯贝怀着一线希望，低声说道。\\n\\n “离开航道，”船长说道。\\n\\n “有什么用？”孤独无助的聪明人回答道，“她又把我抓住了。”\\n\\n “试一试！”船长回答道。“别灰心丧气！来吧！现在是您的好时机。离开航道吧，杰克·邦斯贝！”\\n\\n 可是杰克·邦斯贝没有听从这个劝告，而是悲伤地低声说道：\\n\\n “都是从您的箱子开始的。我为什么那天夜里要把她护送回家呢？”\\n\\n “我的朋友，”船长结结巴巴地说道，“我原以为是您战胜了她，而不是她战胜了您。您是个这样见多识广的聪明人！”\\n\\n 邦斯贝先生只是发出一声压抑住的呼声。\\n\\n “来吧！”船长用胳膊肘轻轻地推推他，说道，“现在是您的好时机！离开航道吧！我将会掩护您的退路。现在是逃走的时候！邦斯贝！这是为了自由。下决心吧！一！”\\n\\n 邦斯贝一动不动。\\n\\n “邦斯贝，”船长低声说道，“下决心吧！二！”\\n\\n 拜期贝第二次没有动。\\n\\n “邦斯贝！”船长催促道，“这是为了自由；下决心吧！三！\\n\\n 要么现在逃走，要么永远也逃走不了了！”\\n\\n 邦斯贝那时还没有动，而且永远也不动了，因为麦克斯廷杰在这之后立即跟他结了婚。\\n\\n 在婚礼中船长感到最可怕的情况之一是朱莉安娜·麦克斯廷杰对婚礼所显示出的极大的兴趣，以及这位很有前途、现在已经是她母亲的翻版的孩子在观察整个程序进行时所表现出的不详的专心致志。船长从这当中看到了捕获男子的圈套正接连不断、无穷无尽地伸展开来；也看到了海员们世世代代所受的压制与胁迫，它注定了海运事业必然的命运。这景象比博库姆太太和另一位女士的坚定无畏的神态，比那位身材矮小的戴大礼帽的先生的兴高采烈的情绪，或甚至比麦克斯廷杰太太的凶恶而又坚强的性格更使他难忘。年幼的麦克斯廷杰们对正在进行的事情很不了解，更不关心，在仪式进行过程中主要在相互踩半高统靴；但是这些可怜的小儿们的行为只是更加衬托出和点缀了朱莉安娜身上所显露出的发育过早的妇女的征象。船长想，再过一、两年，居住在这些孩子们的家里将会遭到毁灭。\\n\\n 婚礼结束的时候，所有年轻的家庭成员们都跳跃着拥到邦斯贝先生身前，亲切地称他为爸爸，向他欢呼，并从他那里讨取半便士。这些感情洋溢的场面过去之后，队伍准备又要出发，这时由于亚历山大·麦克斯廷杰意想不到地极度悲痛，因此把出发时间稍稍推迟了一些时候。看来，这个可爱的孩子把小教堂跟墓碑联系起来了；他认为进小教堂的目的如果不是像平时那样去做礼拜的话，那么他就以为他的母亲即将被庄重地埋葬，他将永远失去她了；他因为确信这一点，心中十分痛苦，就用令人惊奇的气力，拼命大哭，脸色都发青了。这种亲切的感情的表露不管多么使他的母亲感动，但这位杰出的女人的性格却不允许她的赞许退化为软弱。所以，她为了开导他醒悟，对他的头进行摇晃，刺戳，责骂以及采取其他类似的措施仍然失效之后，就把他拉到新鲜空气中，试用另一种方法；婚礼的参加者们听到迅速传来了接连不断的尖锐的类似鼓掌的，然后他们看到亚历山大接触到庭院中极冷的铺路石，脸孔涨得通红，高声痛哭起来。\\n\\n 然后，队伍又重新排好，并向结婚筵席已摆好的布里格广场进发；它按照来的次序回去，路旁的人群向邦斯贝发出了许多诙谐的祝贺，恭喜他新近获得的幸福。船长一直陪送到住宅门口；但是博库姆太太愈来愈亲热的态度使他感到不安，因为这位女士已经从她全神贯注的任务中解脱出来（由于新郎已经平安无事地结了婚，女士们的警惕与戒备因而都明显地减弱了），所以腾得出空闲的时间来对他表露兴趣，于是他就在那里用微弱的，以另有约会作为借口，离开了那个住所和那位俘虏，并答应很快就回来。船长还有一个不安的理由，就是他后悔地回想起，邦斯贝被俘首先是他促成的；虽然他确实并非有意要去促成，而是他对这位才智超群的人的智慧无限信任的结果。\\n\\n 直接回到木制海军军官候补生的家里去看望老所尔·吉尔斯，而不首先绕道去打听一下董贝先生的情况怎样，这不是船长所想选择的路线；尽管董贝先生躺着养病的房屋是在伦敦近郊，一块荒野的边缘，他也还是要去。所以当他已走累了的时候，他就在半路得到一个人的帮助，搭了他的车，愉快地完成了其余的旅程。\\n\\n 窗帘已经拉下来，房屋十分寂静，因此船长几乎害怕敲门；但是他挨着门静听，听到里面靠近门口的地方有轻微的，所以就轻轻地敲了一下。图茨先生前来开门。实际上，图茨先生和他的妻子刚刚才到达那里；他们首先到海军军官候补生那里找他，并从那里得到这个住址。\\n\\n 虽然他们不久前才到达那里，但图茨夫人已经从什么人那里把婴孩抓到手，把他抱在怀里，坐在楼梯上，搂着他，爱抚着他。弗洛伦斯在她身旁，向他们弯下身子；谁也不知道，图茨夫人搂得最多，爱抚得最多的是谁，是母亲还是婴儿；谁也不知道，谁最爱谁，是弗洛伦斯最爱图茨夫人，还是图茨夫人最爱弗洛伦斯，还是两个人最爱这小婴孩；这几个人满怀着深情与激动。\\n\\n “您的爸爸病得很重吗，我亲爱的宝贝弗洛伊小姐？”苏珊问道。\\n\\n “他病得很重，很重，”弗洛伦斯说道。“但是，苏珊，亲爱的，您不应该像过去那样对我说话。啊，这是什么？”弗洛伦斯惊奇地摸摸她的衣服，说道，“这是您过去的旧衣服吗，亲爱的？这是您过去的帽子，卷发，一切都是过去的吗？”\\n\\n 苏珊突然泪流满脸，大哭起来，并在那只十分惊异地抚摸着她的小手上像阵雨一般地不断吻着。\\n\\n “我亲爱的董贝小姐，”图茨先生向前走了一步，说道，“我来向您解释。她是一位极了不起的女人。没有多少人能比得上她！她经常说——她在我们结婚之前就说了，一直说到今天——，您不论什么时候回到家里，她都要来看您；她不穿别的衣服，而只穿她过去服侍您时穿过的衣服，因为唯恐不这样她在您面前就会显得生疏起来，也唯恐您会不像过去那么喜欢她。我本人赞美这衣服，”图茨先生说道，“我喜欢她穿着它！我亲爱的董贝小姐，她将重新做您的侍女，您的保姆，以及她过去曾做过的一切。她没有变。”图茨先生怀着伟大的感情与崇高的钦佩的心情，说了这些话以后，又说道，“但是，苏珊，我亲爱的，我所要请求的只是，您要记住医生的话，不要把自己搞得太累了。”\\n\\n
