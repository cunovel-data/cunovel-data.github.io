{"id":3805,"no":57,"title":"Chapter 57","content":"Another Wedding\n Mr Sownds the beadle, and Mrs Miff the pew-opener, are early at their posts in the fine church where Mr Dombey was married. A yellow-faced old gentleman from India, is going to take unto himself a young wife this morning, and six carriages full of company are expected, and Mrs Miff has been informed that the yellow-faced old gentleman could pave the road to church with diamonds and hardly miss them. The nuptial benediction is to be a superior one, proceeding from a very reverend, a dean, and the lady is to be given away, as an extraordinary present, by somebody who comes express from the Horse Guards\n Mrs Miff is more intolerant of common people this morning, than she generally is; and she his always strong opinions on that subject, for it is associated with free sittings. Mrs Miff is not a student of political economy (she thinks the science is connected with dissenters; \u0027Baptists or Wesleyans, or some o\u0027 them,\u0027 she says), but she can never understand what business your common folks have to be married. \u0027Drat \u0027em,\u0027 says Mrs Miff \u0027you read the same things over \u0027em\u0027 and instead of sovereigns get sixpences!\u0027\n Mr Sownds the beadle is more liberal than Mrs Miff - but then he is not a pew-opener. \u0027It must be done, Ma\u0027am,\u0027 he says. \u0027We must marry \u0027em. We must have our national schools to walk at the head of, and we must have our standing armies. We must marry \u0027em, Ma\u0027am,\u0027 says Mr Sownds, \u0027and keep the country going.\u0027\n Mr Sownds is sitting on the steps and Mrs Miff is dusting in the church, when a young couple, plainly dressed, come in. The mortified bonnet of Mrs Miff is sharply turned towards them, for she espies in this early visit indications of a runaway match. But they don\u0027t want to be married - \u0027Only,\u0027 says the gentleman, \u0027to walk round the church.\u0027 And as he slips a genteel compliment into the palm of Mrs Miff, her vinegary face relaxes, and her mortified bonnet and her spare dry figure dip and crackle.\n Mrs Miff resumes her dusting and plumps up her cushions - for the yellow-faced old gentleman is reported to have tender knees - but keeps her glazed, pew-opening eye on the young couple who are walking round the church. \u0027Ahem,\u0027 coughs Mrs Miff whose cough is drier than the hay in any hassock in her charge, \u0027you\u0027ll come to us one of these mornings, my dears, unless I\u0027m much mistaken!\u0027\n They are looking at a tablet on the wall, erected to the memory of someone dead. They are a long way off from Mrs Miff, but Mrs Miff can see with half an eye how she is leaning on his arm, and how his head is bent down over her. \u0027Well, well,\u0027 says Mrs Miff, \u0027you might do worse. For you\u0027re a tidy pair!\u0027\n There is nothing personal in Mrs Miff\u0027s remark. She merely speaks of stock-in-trade. She is hardly more curious in couples than in coffins. She is such a spare, straight, dry old lady - such a pew of a woman - that you should find as many individual sympathies in a chip. Mr Sownds, now, who is fleshy, and has scarlet in his coat, is of a different temperament. He says, as they stand upon the steps watching the young couple away, that she has a pretty figure, hasn\u0027t she, and as well as he could see (for she held her head down coming out), an uncommon pretty face. \u0027Altogether, Mrs Miff,\u0027 says Mr Sownds with a relish, \u0027she is what you may call a rose-bud.\u0027\n Mrs Miff assents with a spare nod of her mortified bonnet; but approves of this so little, that she inwardly resolves she wouldn\u0027t be the wife of Mr Sownds for any money he could give her, Beadle as he is.\n And what are the young couple saying as they leave the church, and go out at the gate?\n \u0027Dear Walter, thank you! I can go away, now, happy.\u0027\n \u0027And when we come back, Florence, we will come and see his grave again.\u0027\n Florence lifts her eyes, so bright with tears, to his kind face; and clasps her disengaged hand on that other modest little hand which clasps his arm.\n \u0027It is very early, Walter, and the streets are almost empty yet. Let us walk.\u0027\n \u0027But you will be so tired, my love.\u0027\n \u0027Oh no! I was very tired the first time that we ever walked together, but I shall not be so to-day.\u0027 And thus - not much changed - she, as innocent and earnest-hearted - he, as frank, as hopeful, and more proud of her - Florence and Walter, on their bridal morning, walk through the streets together.\n Not even in that childish walk of long ago, were they so far removed from all the world about them as to-day. The childish feet of long ago, did not tread such enchanted ground as theirs do now. The confidence and love of children may be given many times, and will spring up in many places; but the woman\u0027s heart of Florence, with its undivided treasure, can be yielded only once, and under slight or change, can only droop and die.\n They take the streets that are the quietest, and do not go near that in which her old home stands. It is a fair, warm summer morning, and the sun shines on them, as they walk towards the darkening mist that overspreads the City. Riches are uncovering in shops; jewels, gold, and silver flash in the goldsmith\u0027s sunny windows; and great houses cast a stately shade upon them as they pass. But through the light, and through the shade, they go on lovingly together, lost to everything around; thinking of no other riches, and no prouder home, than they have now in one another.\n Gradually they come into the darker, narrower streets, where the sun, now yellow, and now red, is seen through the mist, only at street corners, and in small open spaces where there is a tree, or one of the innumerable churches, or a paved way and a flight of steps, or a curious little patch of garden, or a burying-ground, where the few tombs and tombstones are almost black. Lovingly and trustfully, through all the narrow yards and alleys and the shady streets, Florence goes, clinging to his arm, to be his wife.\n Her heart beats quicker now, for Walter tells her that their church is very near. They pass a few great stacks of warehouses, with waggons at the doors, and busy carmen stopping up the way - but Florence does not see or hear them - and then the air is quiet, and the day is darkened, and she is trembling in a church which has a strange smell like a cellar.\n The shabby little old man, ringer of the disappointed bell, is standing in the porch, and has put his hat in the font - for he is quite at home there, being sexton. He ushers them into an old brown, panelled, dusty vestry, like a corner-cupboard with the shelves taken out; where the wormy registers diffuse a smell like faded snuff, which has set the tearful Nipper sneezing.\n Youthful, and how beautiful, the young bride looks, in this old dusty place, with no kindred object near her but her husband. There is a dusty old clerk, who keeps a sort of evaporated news shop underneath an archway opposite, behind a perfect fortification of posts. There is a dusty old pew-opener who only keeps herself, and finds that quite enough to do. There is a dusty old beadle (these are Mr Toots\u0027s beadle and pew-opener of last Sunday), who has something to do with a Worshipful Company who have got a Hall in the next yard, with a stained-glass window in it that no mortal ever saw. There are dusty wooden ledges and cornices poked in and out over the altar, and over the screen and round the gallery, and over the inscription about what the Master and Wardens of the Worshipful Company did in one thousand six hundred and ninety-four. There are dusty old sounding-boards over the pulpit and reading-desk, looking like lids to be let down on the officiating ministers in case of their giving offence. There is every possible provision for the accommodation of dust, except in the churchyard, where the facilities in that respect are very limited. The Captain, Uncle Sol, and Mr Toots are come; the clergyman is putting on his surplice in the vestry, while the clerk walks round him, blowing the dust off it; and the bride and bridegroom stand before the altar. There is no bridesmaid, unless Susan Nipper is one; and no better father than Captain Cuttle. A man with a wooden leg, chewing a faint apple and carrying a blue bag in has hand, looks in to see what is going on; but finding it nothing entertaining, stumps off again, and pegs his way among the echoes out of doors.\n No gracious ray of light is seen to fall on Florence, kneeling at the altar with her timid head bowed down. The morning luminary is built out, and don\u0027t shine there. There is a meagre tree outside, where the sparrows are chirping a little; and there is a blackbird in an eyelet-hole of sun in a dyer\u0027s garret, over against the window, who whistles loudly whilst the service is performing; and there is the man with the wooden leg stumping away. The amens of the dusty clerk appear, like Macbeth\u0027s, to stick in his throat a little\u0027; but Captain Cuttle helps him out, and does it with so much goodwill that he interpolates three entirely new responses of that word, never introduced into the service before.\n They are married, and have signed their names in one of the old sneezy registers, and the clergyman\u0027s surplice is restored to the dust, and the clergymam is gone home. In a dark corner of the dark church, Florence has turned to Susan Nipper, and is weeping in her arms. Mr Toots\u0027s eyes are red. The Captain lubricates his nose. Uncle Sol has pulled down his spectacles from his forehead, and walked out to the door.\n \u0027God bless you, Susan; dearest Susan! If you ever can bear witness to the love I have for Walter, and the reason that I have to love him, do it for his sake. Good-bye! Good-bye!\u0027\n They have thought it better not to go back to the Midshipman, but to part so; a coach is waiting for them, near at hand.\n Miss Nipper cannot speak; she only sobs and chokes, and hugs her mistress. Mr Toots advances, urges her to cheer up, and takes charge of her. Florence gives him her hand - gives him, in the fulness of her heart, her lips - kisses Uncle Sol, and Captain Cuttle, and is borne away by her young husband.\n But Susan cannot bear that Florence should go away with a mournful recollection of her. She had meant to be so different, that she reproaches herself bitterly. Intent on making one last effort to redeem her character, she breaks from Mr Toots and runs away to find the coach, and show a parting smile. The Captain, divining her object, sets off after her; for he feels it his duty also to dismiss them with a cheer, if possible. Uncle Sol and Mr Toots are left behind together, outside the church, to wait for them.\n The coach is gone, but the street is steep, and narrow, and blocked up, and Susan can see it at a stand-still in the distance, she is sure. Captain Cuttle follows her as she flies down the hill, and waves his glazed hat as a general signal, which may attract the right coach and which may not.\n Susan outstrips the Captain, and comes up with it. She looks in at the window, sees Walter, with the gentle face beside him, and claps her hands and screams:\n \u0027Miss Floy, my darling! look at me! We are all so happy now, dear! One more good-bye, my precious, one more!\u0027\n How Susan does it, she don\u0027t know, but she reaches to the window, kisses her, and has her arms about her neck, in a moment.\n We are all so happy now, my dear Miss Floy!\u0027 says Susan, with a suspicious catching in her breath. \u0027You, you won\u0027t be angry with me now. Now will you?\u0027\n \u0027Angry, Susan!\u0027\n \u0027No, no; I am sure you won\u0027t. I say you won\u0027t, my pet, my dearest!\u0027 exclaims Susan; \u0027and here\u0027s the Captain too - your friend the Captain, you know - to say good-bye once more!\u0027\n \u0027Hooroar, my Heart\u0027s Delight!\u0027 vociferates the Captain, with a countenance of strong emotion. \u0027Hooroar, Wal\u0027r my lad. Hooroar! Hooroar!\u0027\n What with the young husband at one window, and the young wife at the other; the Captain hanging on at this door, and Susan Nipper holding fast by that; the coach obliged to go on whether it will or no, and all the other carts and coaches turbulent because it hesitates; there never was so much confusion on four wheels. But Susan Nipper gallantly maintains her point. She keeps a smiling face upon her mistress, smiling through her tears, until the last. Even when she is left behind, the Captain continues to appear and disappear at the door, crying \u0027Hooroar, my lad! Hooroar, my Heart\u0027s Delight!\u0027 with his shirt-collar in a violent state of agitation, until it is hopeless to attempt to keep up with the coach any longer. Finally, when the coach is gone, Susan Nipper, being rejoined by the Captain, falls into a state of insensibility, and is taken into a baker\u0027s shop to recover.\n Uncle Sol and Mr Toots wait patiently in the churchyard, sitting on the coping-stone of the railings, until Captain Cuttle and Susan come back, Neither being at all desirous to speak, or to be spoken to, they are excellent company, and quite satisfied. When they all arrive again at the little Midshipman, and sit down to breakfast, nobody can touch a morsel. Captain Cuttle makes a feint of being voracious about toast, but gives it up as a swindle. Mr Toots says, after breakfast, he will come back in the evening; and goes wandering about the town all day, with a vague sensation upon him as if he hadn\u0027t been to bed for a fortnight.\n There is a strange charm in the house, and in the room, in which they have been used to be together, and out of which so much is gone. It aggravates, and yet it soothes, the sorrow of the separation. Mr Toots tells Susan Nipper when he comes at night, that he hasn\u0027t been so wretched all day long, and yet he likes it. He confides in Susan Nipper, being alone with her, and tells her what his feelings were when she gave him that candid opinion as to the probability of Miss Dombey\u0027s ever loving him. In the vein of confidence engendered by these common recollections, and their tears, Mr Toots proposes that they shall go out together, and buy something for supper. Miss Nipper assenting, they buy a good many little things; and, with the aid of Mrs Richards, set the supper out quite showily before the Captain and old Sol came home.\n The Captain and old Sol have been on board the ship, and have established Di there, and have seen the chests put aboard. They have much to tell about the popularity of Walter, and the comforts he will have about him, and the quiet way in which it seems he has been working early and late, to make his cabin what the Captain calls \u0027a picter,\u0027 to surprise his little wife. \u0027A admiral\u0027s cabin, mind you,\u0027 says the Captain, \u0027ain\u0027t more trim.\u0027\n But one of the Captain\u0027s chief delights is, that he knows the big watch, and the sugar-tongs, and tea-spoons, are on board: and again and again he murmurs to himself, \u0027Ed\u0027ard Cuttle, my lad, you never shaped a better course in your life than when you made that there little property over jintly. You see how the land bore, Ed\u0027ard,\u0027 says the Captain, \u0027and it does you credit, my lad.\u0027\n The old Instrument-maker is more distraught and misty than he used to be, and takes the marriage and the parting very much to heart. But he is greatly comforted by having his old ally, Ned Cuttle, at his side; and he sits down to supper with a grateful and contented face.\n \u0027My boy has been preserved and thrives,\u0027 says old Sol Gills, rubbing his hands. \u0027What right have I to be otherwise than thankful and happy!\u0027\n The Captain, who has not yet taken his seat at the table, but who has been fidgeting about for some time, and now stands hesitating in his place, looks doubtfully at Mr Gills, and says:\n \u0027Sol! There\u0027s the last bottle of the old Madeira down below. Would you wish to have it up to-night, my boy, and drink to Wal\u0027r and his wife?\u0027\n The Instrument-maker, looking wistfully at the Captain, puts his hand into the breast-pocket of his coffee-coloured coat, brings forth his pocket-book, and takes a letter out.\n \u0027To Mr Dombey,\u0027 says the old man. \u0027From Walter. To be sent in three weeks\u0027 time. I\u0027ll read it.\u0027\n \u0027\"Sir. I am married to your daughter. She is gone with me upon a distant voyage. To be devoted to her is to have no claim on her or you, but God knows that I am.\n \u0027\"Why, loving her beyond all earthly things, I have yet, without remorse, united her to the uncertainties and dangers of my life, I will not say to you. You know why, and you are her father.\n \u0027\"Do not reproach her. She has never reproached you.\n \u0027\"I do not think or hope that you will ever forgive me. There is nothing I expect less. But if an hour should come when it will comfort you to believe that Florence has someone ever near her, the great charge of whose life is to cancel her remembrance of past sorrow, I solemnly assure you, you may, in that hour, rest in that belief.\"\u0027\n Solomon puts back the letter carefully in his pocket-book, and puts back his pocket-book in his coat.\n \u0027We won\u0027t drink the last bottle of the old Madeira yet, Ned,\u0027 says the old man thoughtfully. \u0027Not yet.\n \u0027Not yet,\u0027 assents the Captain. \u0027No. Not yet.\u0027\n Susan and Mr Toots are of the same opinion. After a silence they all sit down to supper, and drink to the young husband and wife in something else; and the last bottle of the old Madeira still remains among its dust and cobwebs, undisturbed.\n A few days have elapsed, and a stately ship is out at sea, spreading its white wings to the favouring wind.\n Upon the deck, image to the roughest man on board of something that is graceful, beautiful, and harmless - something that it is good and pleasant to have there, and that should make the voyage prosperous - is Florence. It is night, and she and Walter sit alone, watching the solemn path of light upon the sea between them and the moon.\n At length she cannot see it plainly, for the tears that fill her eyes; and then she lays her head down on his breast, and puts her arms around his neck, saying, \u0027Oh Walter, dearest love, I am so happy!\u0027\n Her husband holds her to his heart, and they are very quiet, and the stately ship goes on serenely.\n \u0027As I hear the sea,\u0027 says Florence, \u0027and sit watching it, it brings so many days into my mind. It makes me think so much - \u0027\n \u0027Of Paul, my love. I know it does.\u0027\n Of Paul and Walter. And the voices in the waves are always whispering to Florence, in their ceaseless murmuring, of love - of love, eternal and illimitable, not bounded by the confines of this world, or by the end of time, but ranging still, beyond the sea, beyond the sky, to the invisible country far away!\n 教区事务员桑兹先生和教堂领座人米福太太很早就到董贝先生结婚的那座华丽的教堂来，待在他们的工作岗位上了。这天上午有一位印度的黄脸的老先生要娶一位年轻的妻子，预料有六辆马车的客人要来参加婚礼。米福太太还听说，这位黄脸的老先生能够用钻石铺砌通到教堂的道路，而他几乎不会发觉他的财产少去了这样一笔数字。结婚的祝福仪式将是极为隆重的，——由副主教大师亲自主持，新娘将作为一个特别贵重的礼物，由警卫骑兵第三团特地派来的某个人送给男方主婚人。\n 米福太太这天早上对普通的人们比平日更不能容忍；在这个问题上她的意见向来是强烈的，因为这是与免费座位有关的。米福太太并不是研究政治经济学的（她认为这门科学是跟不信奉英国国教的人有关的，“跟浸礼教徒或韦斯利教派的教徒有关”，她说），可是她无论如何也不明白，为什么你们这些普通的人们也必须结婚。“讨厌！”米福太太说道，“您向他们念的东西跟向别人念的东西完全一样，可是从他们那里只能得到一些六便士的硬币，而得不到金镑！”\n 教区事务员桑兹先生比米福太太心胸宽大——不过要知道他不是个领座人。“事情还得办，夫人，”他说道，“我们还得让他们结婚。我们首先还得补充我们国民学校的学生，我们还得要有我们的常备军。我们还得让他们结婚，夫人，”桑兹先生说道，“这样才能使国家繁荣昌盛。”\n 桑兹先生坐在台阶上、米福太太在教堂里掸灰尘的时候，一对穿著朴素的年轻人走进教堂。米福太太的干瘪的帽子敏捷地转向他们，因为他们这样老早来到教堂，她从这一点看出这对人有从家里逃出来的迹象。可是他们并不想要结婚，“只是到教堂来转转，”——那位先生说道。由于他在米福太太的手掌里塞了慷慨的礼金，她那尖酸刻薄的脸孔就开朗起来了，她那干瘪的帽子和枯瘦的身形也向下低垂，行了个屈膝礼，并发出了窸窸窣窣的。\n 米福太太重新掸灰尘，并把坐垫敲打得蓬松一些——因为据说黄脸的老先生膝盖娇嫩——，但她那双没有光泽的、习惯于领座的眼睛并没有离开那对在教堂里走来走去的年轻人。“阿嗨，”米福太太咳嗽道，她的咳嗽比她管理的膝垫里的干草还要干，“你们不久有一天还会到我们这里来的，我这么说没错吧，我亲爱的。”\n 他们在看镶嵌在墙上的一块纪念某个死者的石碑。他们离米福太太很远，但是米福太太却能用半只眼睛看到她怎样靠在他的胳膊上，他的头怎样低垂到她的头上。“唔，唔，”米福太太说道，“你们可能做更荒唐的事情，因为你们是很巧妙的一对！”\n 在米福太太的话中没有吐露她个人的感情。她对成双结对的男女几乎并不比对棺材更感兴趣。她是一位消瘦的、笔直的、干枯的老太太——不像个女人，而像是一张教堂里的条凳式座位——，从她那里找到的同情就跟从木片中找到的一样多。但是肥头胖耳、穿着深红色饰边礼服的桑兹先生却是另一种性格的人。当他们站在台阶上目送着这一对年轻人离去的时候，他说，“这姑娘的身材优美，是不是？”，而且就他所能看到的来说（因为她走出教堂的时候低着头），她的面貌也非常漂亮。“总的来说，米福太太，”桑兹先生津津有味地说道，“您可以管她叫做一个玫瑰骨朵。”\n 米福太太戴着干瘪帽子的头微微地点了点，丝毫也不赞成这些话；桑兹先生虽然是个教区事务员，但她心里打定主意，不论他给她多少钱，她也决不做他的妻子。\n 这一对年轻人走出教堂，在大门口向外走去的时候，说了些什么呢？\n “亲爱的沃尔特，谢谢你！现在我可以快乐地离开了。”\n “我们回来的时候还可以再来看看他的坟墓，弗洛伦斯。”\n 弗洛伦斯抬起含着泪水、闪闪发亮的眼睛，看着他的亲切的脸。她把空着一只手紧握着另一只紧挽着他胳膊的手。\n “现在很早，沃尔特，街上几乎还没有人。我们走着去吧。”\n “可是您会很累的，我亲爱的。”\n “不不！我们第一次一起走的时候我是很累的，但是今天我不会累。”\n 就这样，弗洛伦斯和沃尔特在他们结婚的这天早上，一起在街道上走着；跟过去没有很大的变化——她，仍旧那样的天真无邪，真心诚意；他，仍旧那样心胸坦率、朝气蓬勃，可是却更因为她而感到自豪了。\n 甚至在好多年以前的孩子的步行中，他们也不曾像今天这样远离周围整个世界。好多年以前孩子的脚步也不曾像他们现在的脚步这样踩着如此迷人的土地。孩子的信任与爱可以给出许多次，并会在许多地方生长起来，可是弗洛伦斯的女性的心和它所珍藏着的不可分割的爱却只能给出一次，如果遭到冷落与不忠的话，那么它就只能萎靡不振，然后死去。\n 他们选择了最安静的街道，并且不是走近她老家所在的街道。这是个睛朗的、温暖的夏天的早晨；当他们朝着笼罩着伦敦城的阴沉沉的雾走去的时候，太阳照耀着他们。宝贵的货物在商店中陈列着；宝石、金、银在首饰商的阳光充足的窗子中闪耀着；当他们走过的时候，高大的房屋在他们身上投下了庄严的阴影。可是他们在阳光中、在阴影中相亲相爱地一起向前走去，看不见周围的一切；除了他们在彼此身上找到的财富之外，他们没有想到任何其他财富；除了他们在彼此身上找到的家之外，他们没有想到其他更值得自豪的家。\n 他们渐渐地走进了比较阴暗、比较狭窄的街道；在这些街道里，只有在那些街道角落里和那些小片敞开的地方才能通过薄雾看到时而黄色、时而红色的太阳；在那些小片敞开的地方，或者有株树，或者有一座教堂，或者有一条铺砌的道路和一座台阶，或者有一小片意趣奇妙的花园，或者有一片墓地，墓地上寥寥无几的坟墓和墓碑几乎已发黑了。弗洛伦斯相亲相爱地、信任地、紧紧挽着他的胳膊，穿过所有狭窄的围场与胡同以及阴暗的街道，向前走去，去成为他的妻子。\n 她的心现在跳动得更快了，困为沃尔特告诉她，他们的教堂离这里很近了。他们走过了几个很大的仓库，仓库门口停着一些四轮运货马车，忙碌的搬运工人堵塞了道路，可是弗洛伦斯没有看到他们，也没有听到他们说话；接着气氛安静下来了，白天的光线变得阴暗了，现在弗洛伦斯是在一座教堂里了，那里散发出像地窖里一样的气味。\n 那位衣衫褴褛、身材矮小的老头子，失望的钟声的敲打者，这时正站在门廊里，他的帽子就放在洗礼盘中——因为他是教堂司事，在这里就像在家中一样毫无拘束。他把他们领进一个老旧的、褐色的、镶嵌了嵌板的、积满灰尘的法衣室；它像是一个摆在角落里的、已经取出格板的碗柜；室内被虫蛀了的登记簿散发出一股像鼻烟的气味，它使眼泪汪汪的尼珀直打喷嚏。\n 年轻的新娘在这老旧的、积满灰尘的地方看去是多么富有朝气、多么美丽，在她身旁除了她的丈夫之外，没有别的亲属。这里有一位满身灰尘的年老的教会文书，他在教堂对面由柱子构成的加固工事的拱道的下面开设了一个出卖过时消息之类的店铺。这里有一位满身灰尘的年老的教堂领座人，她只供养她自己，并觉得这就够她操心费神的。这里有一位满身灰尘的年老的教区事务员（这位教区事务员和上面说到的那位教堂领座人就是图茨先生上星期天看到的），他和一个虔敬社有些关系；这个虔敬社在邻近的院子里有一个祈祷厅，祈祷厅里有一个凡人不容易见到过的彩色玻璃窗。这里有积满灰尘的木头壁架和上楣，它们长短不齐地摆放在圣坛上面、围屏上面、边座周围以及虔敬社社长与监察人1694年大事记的碑文上面。这里有积满灰尘的回声板，装在布道坛和读经台上面，看去就像盖子一样，如果教士在执行祈祷仪式时侮辱了教堂会众的话，那么就可以把它拉下来，盖在这些教士的头上。这里到处都有积聚灰尘的各种可能的装置，只有在教堂的墓地是例外，那里这方面的设施是很有限的。\n 船长、所尔舅舅和图茨先生来了。教士正在法衣室里穿上宽大的白色法衣，教堂文书则在他周围走来走去，吹去法衣上的灰尘；新郎和新娘站在圣坛前面。除非把苏珊·尼珀当做女嫔相，否则就没有女嫔相了；至于代理主婚人，那么没有谁能比卡特尔船长更合适的了。一位装了一条木腿的人，嘴里嚼着一只烂苹果，手里提着一只蓝色的袋子，到教堂里来看看正在进行什么事情，但是发现没有什么有趣的事，就又一拐一拐地走开了，他那假腿在门外一阵阵的回声中向前走着。\n 弗洛伦斯羞怯地低垂着头，跪在圣坛前面，没有一缕仁慈的光线照在她的身上。上午的太阳被房屋遮蔽了，没有照射到那里。门外有一株枯槁的树，树上有几只麻雀在啁啾几声；在窗子对面，在一位染色工人的顶楼里，在太阳能偷偷照进去的一个小孔中有一只画眉，当结婚仪式在进行的时候，它大声地吱吱叫着。还有那位装着木腿的人正迈着沉重的步子向别处走去。满身灰尘的教堂文书说“阿门”时，就像麦克佩斯一样，稍稍梗塞在喉咙中①；但是卡特尔船长帮助他说出来，他怀着满腔热情说它，在仪式中过去从来不说“阿门”的地方，他也插进去说了三次。\n --------\n ①莎士比亚悲剧《麦克佩斯》第二幕第二场：\n 麦克佩斯：一个喊，“上帝保佑我们！”一个喊，“阿门！”好像他们看见我高举这一双杀人的血手似的。听着他们惊慌的口气，当他们说过了“上帝保佑我们”以后，我想要说“阿门”却怎么也说不出来。\n 他们结婚了，在使人打喷嚏的旧登记簿当中的一本上签了名；教士的宽大的白色法衣又收藏到积满灰尘的地方；教士则回家了。在黑暗的教堂的一个黑暗的角落里，弗洛伦斯转过身，走到苏珊·尼珀身边，在她的怀抱里哭泣着。图茨先生的眼睛红了。船长把鼻子擦得亮亮的。所尔舅舅把眼镜从前额上拉下来，走到门口。\n “上帝保佑你，苏珊；我最亲爱的苏珊！如果有一天你能替我对沃尔特的爱情和我必须爱他的理由作见证人的话，那么请为了他的缘故这样做吧。再见！再见！”\n 他们决定不回到海军军官候补生那里，而在这里离别。马车在附近等着他们。\n 尼珀姑娘说不出话；她只是抽抽嗒嗒地哭着，气都喘不过来，同时紧紧地拥抱着她的女主人。图茨先生走到她跟前，安慰她，劝她高兴起来，并照看着她。弗洛伦斯向他伸出手来，真诚地向他凑近嘴唇，并且吻了所尔舅舅和卡特尔船长，然后被她年轻的丈夫带走了。\n 可是苏珊不容许弗洛伦斯心里对她留下一个悲伤的回忆。她原先本想表现得和现在完全不同，所以她痛苦地责备着自己。她决定作最后一次尝试，来恢复她的性格，因此就离开图茨先生，跑去找马车，以便露出笑脸告别。船长猜出她的目的，就跟随着她；因为他也觉得，如果可能的话，他有责任用欢呼来送别他们。所尔舅舅和图茨先生留在后面，在教堂前面等待着他们。\n 马车已经启程了，但是街道陡峭、狭窄、堵塞，苏珊毫不怀疑，她看到马车正停在远处的一个地方。当她沿着小山往下飞跑过去的时候，卡特尔船长跟随在她的后面，挥动着上了光的帽子作为信号；它可能会引起那辆马车的注意，也可能不会引起它的注意。\n 苏珊把船长抛在后面，赶上了马车。她往车窗里看，看见了沃尔特和他身旁的温柔的脸孔，就拍拍手，尖声叫道：\n “弗洛伊小姐，我亲爱的！请看看我吧！现在我们全都这么快乐，亲爱的！再说一次再见吧，我亲爱的，再说一次再见吧！”\n 苏珊怎么做到了这一点，她自己也不知道，不过她在片刻间就把头探进窗子，吻了弗洛伦斯，并用手搂住她的脖子。\n “现在我们全都这么——这么快乐，我亲爱的弗洛伊小姐！”苏珊说道，她的可疑地中断了一下。“现在您，您不会生我的气了吧。不会了，是不是？”\n “生气，苏珊！”\n “不会了，不会了；我相信您不会了。我说您不会了，我的宝贝，我最亲爱的！”苏珊高声喊道，“船长也在这里——您的朋友船长——您知道——他也来跟你们再一次告别！”\n “万岁，我的心的喜悦！”船长脸上露出强烈的激动的表情，并提高嗓门，喊道，“万岁！我的孩子沃尔。万岁！万岁！”\n 年轻的丈夫从一个窗子中探出身子，年轻的妻子从另一个窗子中探出身子；船长悬挂在这个车门上，苏珊·尼珀紧紧抓住另一个车门；马车不管是愿意还是不愿意，不得不继续向前驶行；所有其他的二轮运货马车与轿式马车都由于它的停顿而怨声鼎沸；在四只轮子上面从来没有发生过这样的混乱。可是苏珊·尼珀还是勇敢地把她的决心坚持到底。她一直向她的女主人露出笑脸，流着眼泪笑着，直到最后。甚至当她被马车抛在后面的时候，船长还时而出现在车门口，时而又在车门口消失，喊道，“万岁，我的孩子！万岁，我的心的喜悦！”他的衬衫领子则在激烈地飘动着，直到后来，他再没有希望赶上马车了，他才停止追赶。当马车离开之后，船长又跟苏珊·尼珀走在一起的时候，她人事不省地昏了过去，于是船长就把她送到一家烤面包的店铺里，让她苏醒过来。\n 所尔舅舅和图茨先生在教堂院子里坐在栏杆的盖顶石上，耐心地等着卡特尔船长和苏珊回来。谁也不想讲话，谁也不想听别人讲话，他们俩真是极好的伙伴，彼此都很满意。当他们四人又全都回到海军军官候补生家里，坐下来吃早饭的时候，没有一个人能咽得下一口。卡特尔船长假装出对烤面包片很贪吃的样子，但终究还是放弃了这个骗人的花招。图茨先生在早餐之后说，他将在晚上回来；他整天都在城里闲逛，心中模糊地感到，仿佛他已有两个星期没有睡过觉似的。\n 他们过去惯常待在一起、如今却变得空荡荡的住宅与房间有着一种奇怪的魔力。它加深了、然而却又抚慰了离别的悲哀。图茨先生夜间回来的时候告诉苏珊·尼珀，他从来不曾像今天这样感到忧郁的，然而他却喜欢这样。当他们单独在一起的时候，他向苏珊·尼珀吐露，当她过去坦率地说出董贝小姐是否有一天可能爱他的看法的时候，他当时的心情是怎样的。\n 怀着这些共同回忆和一起流泪所产生的相互信任的心情，图茨先生建议他们一起出去买些晚餐吃的东西。尼珀姑娘同意，他们就买回好多美味的小食品，在理查兹大嫂的帮助下，开出了一顿相当丰美的晚餐。\n 船长和老所尔到船上去过了；他们把戴送到那里，并看着箱子装上船。他们有很多话好谈：沃尔特怎样受到大家的喜爱；他怎样把船上收拾得舒舒适适；他怎样一直在悄悄地忙乎着，把他的船舱布置得就像船长所说，像“图画”一样，让他的小妻子看了吃惊。“要知道，”船长说道，“海军上将的船舱也不会比那更漂亮。”\n 但是最使船长高兴的事情当中的一件事，就是他知道，那只大表，还有方糖钳子和茶匙都已放到船上了。他一次又一次低声地自言自语道，“爱德华·卡特尔，我的孩子，当你把那包小小的财产转交给他们共同使用时，你是选择了你这一生中最好的一条航线啊！爱德华，你知道哪里是岸，这给你增光，我的孩子。”船长说道。\n 年老的仪器制造商比平时更心神错乱，眼睛更多泪；结婚与离别使他很伤心。但是有他的老朋友内德·卡特尔在身边陪伴他，使他感到极大的安慰；他坐下吃晚饭时，脸上的表情是感激和满足的。\n “我的孩子安全无恙，茁壮成长，”老所尔·吉尔斯搓着手，说道，“我有什么权利不感谢与快乐呢！”\n 船长一直坐立不安，还没有在桌旁坐下来，这时迟疑不决地站在他的地方，怀疑地看着吉尔斯先生，说道：\n “所尔！下面还有最后一瓶马德拉陈酒，今天夜里你是不是希望把它拿上来，为沃尔和他的妻子的健康干杯？”\n 仪器制造商若有所思地看着船长，把手伸进咖啡色上衣胸前的小袋中，掏出了一个小本子，从里面抽出一封信。\n “沃尔特写给董贝先生的信，”老人说道，“要求在三星期内送到。我来念吧。”\n “‘先生。我跟您的女儿结婚了。她已跟我出发进行一次远距离的航行。要对她忠诚就是对她或对您不提任何要求；但是上帝知道，我对她是忠诚的。\n “‘我爱她胜过世间一切事物。为什么我毫不后悔地已把她跟我的变化无常、充满危险的生活联结在一起，我不想跟您说。您知道为什么，您是她的父亲。\n “‘别责备她。她从来没有责备过您。\n “‘我不认为，也不希望，您有一天会宽恕我。我丝毫也不指望这一点。如果将来有一个时候，您快慰地相信，在弗洛伦斯身边有一个人，他的生活的重大责任就是消除她对过去悲痛的回忆，如果这样一个时候来临的话，那么我将庄严地向您保证，那时候您将会相信这一点而安心。’”\n 所罗门把信小心地放回小本子里，又把小本子放回到上衣中。\n “我们现在还不要喝那最后一瓶马德拉陈酒，内德，”老人沉思地说道，“现在还不喝。”\n “现在还不喝，”船长同意道，“对，现在还不喝。”\n 苏珊与图茨先生也是同样的意见。他们沉默了一会儿之后全都坐下来吃晚饭，喝点儿别的东西来祝贺这对年轻夫妇的健康；那最后一瓶马德拉陈酒依旧搁在灰尘与蜘蛛网中间，没有受到打扰。\n 过了几天之后，一艘宏伟的船在大海上航行，迎着顺风，展开它的白色的翅膀。\n 弗洛伦斯在甲板上。在船上最粗野的人们看来，她是优雅、美丽与纯洁的化身。她的来到将给船上带来快乐，将使这次航行平安与吉利。这是夜间。她与沃尔特单独坐在那里，注视着他们与月亮之间的海上庄严的光带。\n 她终于不能清楚地看到它了，因为泪水涌满了她的眼睛；于是她把头俯伏在他的胸上，把胳膊搂着他的脖子，说道，“啊，沃尔特，我亲爱的，我是多么幸福！”\n 她的丈夫把她紧紧抱在心窝里，他们很安静；宏伟的船宁静地向前驶行。\n “当我听着大海，坐在这里注视着它的时候，”弗洛伦斯说道，“以往的许多日子涌到了我的心头。它使我想到——”\n “想到保罗，我亲爱的，我知道这点。”\n 想到保罗和沃尔特。海浪在它不断的哗哗的中，一直在向弗洛伦斯低声诉说着爱情——永恒的、无限的爱情；它越过了这个世界的边界，越过了时间的尽头，延伸到海洋之外，延伸到天空之外，一直延伸到遥远的看不见的国家！\n \n
