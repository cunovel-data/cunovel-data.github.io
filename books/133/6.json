{"id":3754,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"Paul\u0027s Second Deprivation\n Polly was beset by so many misgivings in the morning, that but for the incessant promptings of her black-eyed companion, she would have abandoned all thoughts of the expedition, and formally petitioned for leave to see number one hundred and forty-seven, under the awful shadow of Mr Dombey\u0027s roof. But Susan who was personally disposed in favour of the excursion, and who (like Tony Lumpkin), if she could bear the disappointments of other people with tolerable fortitude, could not abide to disappoint herself, threw so many ingenious doubts in the way of this second thought, and stimulated the original intention with so many ingenious arguments, that almost as soon as Mr Dombey\u0027s stately back was turned, and that gentleman was pursuing his daily road towards the City, his unconscious son was on his way to Staggs\u0027s Gardens.\n This euphonious locality was situated in a suburb, known by the inhabitants of Staggs\u0027s Gardens by the name of Camberling Town; a designation which the Strangers\u0027 Map of London, as printed (with a view to pleasant and commodious reference) on pocket handkerchiefs, condenses, with some show of reason, into Camden Town. Hither the two nurses bent their steps, accompanied by their charges; Richards carrying Paul, of course, and Susan leading little Florence by the hand, and giving her such jerks and pokes from time to time, as she considered it wholesome to administer.\n The first shock of a great earthquake had, just at that period, rent the whole neighbourhood to its centre. Traces of its course were visible on every side. Houses were knocked down; streets broken through and stopped; deep pits and trenches dug in the ground; enormous heaps of earth and clay thrown up; buildings that were undermined and shaking, propped by great beams of wood. Here, a chaos of carts, overthrown and jumbled together, lay topsy-turvy at the bottom of a steep unnatural hill; there, confused treasures of iron soaked and rusted in something that had accidentally become a pond. Everywhere were bridges that led nowhere; thoroughfares that were wholly impassable; Babel towers of chimneys, wanting half their height; temporary wooden houses and enclosures, in the most unlikely situations; carcases of ragged tenements, and fragments of unfinished walls and arches, and piles of scaffolding, and wildernesses of bricks, and giant forms of cranes, and tripods straddling above nothing. There were a hundred thousand shapes and substances of incompleteness, wildly mingled out of their places, upside down, burrowing in the earth, aspiring in the air, mouldering in the water, and unintelligible as any dream. Hot springs and fiery eruptions, the usual attendants upon earthquakes, lent their contributions of confusion to the scene. Boiling water hissed and heaved within dilapidated walls; whence, also, the glare and roar of flames came issuing forth; and mounds of ashes blocked up rights of way, and wholly changed the law and custom of the neighbourhood.\n In short, the yet unfinished and unopened Railroad was in progress; and, from the very core of all this dire disorder, trailed smoothly away, upon its mighty course of civilisation and improvement.\n But as yet, the neighbourhood was shy to own the Railroad. One or two bold speculators had projected streets; and one had built a little, but had stopped among the mud and ashes to consider farther of it. A bran-new Tavern, redolent of fresh mortar and size, and fronting nothing at all, had taken for its sign The Railway Arms; but that might be rash enterprise - and then it hoped to sell drink to the workmen. So, the Excavators\u0027 House of Call had sprung up from a beer-shop; and the old-established Ham and Beef Shop had become the Railway Eating House, with a roast leg of pork daily, through interested motives of a similar immediate and popular description. Lodging-house keepers were favourable in like manner; and for the like reasons were not to be trusted. The general belief was very slow. There were frowzy fields, and cow-houses, and dunghills, and dustheaps, and ditches, and gardens, and summer-houses, and carpet-beating grounds, at the very door of the Railway. Little tumuli of oyster shells in the oyster season, and of lobster shells in the lobster season, and of broken crockery and faded cabbage leaves in all seasons, encroached upon its high places. Posts, and rails, and old cautions to trespassers, and backs of mean houses, and patches of wretched vegetation, stared it out of countenance. Nothing was the better for it, or thought of being so. If the miserable waste ground lying near it could have laughed, it would have laughed it to scorn, like many of the miserable neighbours.\n Staggs\u0027s Gardens was uncommonly incredulous. It was a little row of houses, with little squalid patches of ground before them, fenced off with old doors, barrel staves, scraps of tarpaulin, and dead bushes; with bottomless tin kettles and exhausted iron fenders, thrust into the gaps. Here, the Staggs\u0027s Gardeners trained scarlet beans, kept fowls and rabbits, erected rotten summer-houses (one was an old boat), dried clothes, and smoked pipes. Some were of opinion that Staggs\u0027s Gardens derived its name from a deceased capitalist, one Mr Staggs, who had built it for his delectation. Others, who had a natural taste for the country, held that it dated from those rural times when the antlered herd, under the familiar denomination of Staggses, had resorted to its shady precincts. Be this as it may, Staggs\u0027s Gardens was regarded by its population as a sacred grove not to be withered by Railroads; and so confident were they generally of its long outliving any such ridiculous inventions, that the master chimney-sweeper at the corner, who was understood to take the lead in the local politics of the Gardens, had publicly declared that on the occasion of the Railroad opening, if ever it did open, two of his boys should ascend the flues of his dwelling, with instructions to hail the failure with derisive cheers from the chimney-pots.\n To this unhallowed spot, the very name of which had hitherto been carefully concealed from Mr Dombey by his sister, was little Paul now borne by Fate and Richards\n \u0027That\u0027s my house, Susan,\u0027 said Polly, pointing it out.\n \u0027Is it, indeed, Mrs Richards?\u0027 said Susan, condescendingly.\n \u0027And there\u0027s my sister Jemima at the door, I do declare\u0027 cried Polly, \u0027with my own sweet precious baby in her arms!\u0027\n The sight added such an extensive pair of wings to Polly\u0027s impatience, that she set off down the Gardens at a run, and bouncing on Jemima, changed babies with her in a twinkling; to the unutterable astonishment of that young damsel, on whom the heir of the Dombeys seemed to have fallen from the clouds.\n \u0027Why, Polly!\u0027 cried Jemima. \u0027You! what a turn you have given me! who\u0027d have thought it! come along in Polly! How well you do look to be sure! The children will go half wild to see you Polly, that they will.\u0027\n That they did, if one might judge from the noise they made, and the way in which they dashed at Polly and dragged her to a low chair in the chimney corner, where her own honest apple face became immediately the centre of a bunch of smaller pippins, all laying their rosy cheeks close to it, and all evidently the growth of the same tree. As to Polly, she was full as noisy and vehement as the children; and it was not until she was quite out of breath, and her hair was hanging all about her flushed face, and her new christening attire was very much dishevelled, that any pause took place in the confusion. Even then, the smallest Toodle but one remained in her lap, holding on tight with both arms round her neck; while the smallest Toodle but two mounted on the back of the chair, and made desperate efforts, with one leg in the air, to kiss her round the corner.\n \u0027Look! there\u0027s a pretty little lady come to see you,\u0027 said Polly; \u0027and see how quiet she is! what a beautiful little lady, ain\u0027t she?\u0027\n This reference to Florence, who had been standing by the door not unobservant of what passed, directed the attention of the younger branches towards her; and had likewise the happy effect of leading to the formal recognition of Miss Nipper, who was not quite free from a misgiving that she had been already slighted.\n \u0027Oh do come in and sit down a minute, Susan, please,\u0027 said Polly. \u0027This is my sister Jemima, this is. Jemima, I don\u0027t know what I should ever do with myself, if it wasn\u0027t for Susan Nipper; I shouldn\u0027t be here now but for her.\u0027\n \u0027Oh do sit down, Miss Nipper, if you please,\u0027 quoth Jemima.\n Susan took the extreme corner of a chair, with a stately and ceremonious aspect.\n \u0027I never was so glad to see anybody in all my life; now really I never was, Miss Nipper,\u0027 said Jemima.\n Susan relaxing, took a little more of the chair, and smiled graciously.\n \u0027Do untie your bonnet-strings, and make yourself at home, Miss Nipper, please,\u0027 entreated Jemima. \u0027I am afraid it\u0027s a poorer place than you\u0027re used to; but you\u0027ll make allowances, I\u0027m sure.\u0027\n The black-eyed was so softened by this deferential behaviour, that she caught up little Miss Toodle who was running past, and took her to Banbury Cross immediately.\n \u0027But where\u0027s my pretty boy?\u0027 said Polly. \u0027My poor fellow? I came all this way to see him in his new clothes.\u0027\n \u0027Ah what a pity!\u0027 cried Jemima. \u0027He\u0027ll break his heart, when he hears his mother has been here. He\u0027s at school, Polly.\u0027\n \u0027Gone already!\u0027\n \u0027Yes. He went for the first time yesterday, for fear he should lose any learning. But it\u0027s half-holiday, Polly: if you could only stop till he comes home - you and Miss Nipper, leastways,\u0027 said Jemima, mindful in good time of the dignity of the black-eyed.\n \u0027And how does he look, Jemima, bless him!\u0027 faltered Polly.\n \u0027Well, really he don\u0027t look so bad as you\u0027d suppose,\u0027 returned Jemima.\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Polly, with emotion, \u0027I knew his legs must be too short.\u0027\n His legs is short,\u0027 returned Jemima; \u0027especially behind; but they\u0027ll get longer, Polly, every day.\u0027\n It was a slow, prospective kind of consolation; but the cheerfulness and good nature with which it was administered, gave it a value it did not intrinsically possess. After a moment\u0027s silence, Polly asked, in a more sprightly manner:\n \u0027And where\u0027s Father, Jemima dear?\u0027 - for by that patriarchal appellation, Mr Toodle was generally known in the family.\n \u0027There again!\u0027 said Jemima. \u0027What a pity! Father took his dinner with him this morning, and isn\u0027t coming home till night. But he\u0027s always talking of you, Polly, and telling the children about you; and is the peaceablest, patientest, best-temperedest soul in the world, as he always was and will be!\u0027\n \u0027Thankee, Jemima,\u0027 cried the simple Polly; delighted by the speech, and disappointed by the absence.\n \u0027Oh you needn\u0027t thank me, Polly,\u0027 said her sister, giving her a sounding kiss upon the cheek, and then dancing little Paul cheerfully. \u0027I say the same of you sometimes, and think it too.\u0027\n In spite of the double disappointment, it was impossible to regard in the light of a failure a visit which was greeted with such a reception; so the sisters talked hopefully about family matters, and about Biler, and about all his brothers and sisters: while the black-eyed, having performed several journeys to Banbury Cross and back, took sharp note of the furniture, the Dutch clock, the cupboard, the castle on the mantel-piece with red and green windows in it, susceptible of illumination by a candle-end within; and the pair of small black velvet kittens, each with a lady\u0027s reticule in its mouth; regarded by the Staggs\u0027s Gardeners as prodigies of imitative art. The conversation soon becoming general lest the black-eyed should go off at score and turn sarcastic, that young lady related to Jemima a summary of everything she knew concerning Mr Dombey, his prospects, family, pursuits, and character. Also an exact inventory of her personal wardrobe, and some account of her principal relations and friends. Having relieved her mind of these disclosures, she partook of shrimps and porter, and evinced a disposition to swear eternal friendship.\n Little Florence herself was not behind-hand in improving the occasion; for, being conducted forth by the young Toodles to inspect some toad-stools and other curiosities of the Gardens, she entered with them, heart and soul, on the formation of a temporary breakwater across a small green pool that had collected in a corner. She was still busily engaged in that labour, when sought and found by Susan; who, such was her sense of duty, even under the humanizing influence of shrimps, delivered a moral address to her (punctuated with thumps) on her degenerate nature, while washing her face and hands; and predicted that she would bring the grey hairs of her family in general, with sorrow to the grave. After some delay, occasioned by a pretty long confidential interview above stairs on pecuniary subjects, between Polly and Jemima, an interchange of babies was again effected - for Polly had all this timeretained her own child, and Jemima little Paul - and the visitors took leave.\n But first the young Toodles, victims of a pious fraud, were deluded into repairing in a body to a chandler\u0027s shop in the neighbourhood, for the ostensible purpose of spending a penny; and when the coast was quite clear, Polly fled: Jemima calling after her that if they could only go round towards the City Road on their way back, they would be sure to meet little Biler coming from school.\n \u0027Do you think that we might make time to go a little round in that direction, Susan?\u0027 inquired Polly, when they halted to take breath.\n \u0027Why not, Mrs Richards?\u0027 returned Susan.\n \u0027It\u0027s getting on towards our dinner time you know,\u0027 said Polly.\n But lunch had rendered her companion more than indifferent to this grave consideration, so she allowed no weight to it, and they resolved to go \u0027a little round.\u0027\n Now, it happened that poor Biler\u0027s life had been, since yesterday morning, rendered weary by the costume of the Charitable Grinders. The youth of the streets could not endure it. No young vagabond could be brought to bear its contemplation for a moment, without throwing himself upon the unoffending wearer, and doing him a mischief. His social existence had been more like that of an early Christian, than an innocent child of the nineteenth century. He had been stoned in the streets. He had been overthrown into gutters; bespattered with mud; violently flattened against posts. Entire strangers to his person had lifted his yellow cap off his head, and cast it to the winds. His legs had not only undergone verbal criticisms and revilings, but had been handled and pinched. That very morning, he had received a perfectly unsolicited black eye on his way to the Grinders\u0027 establishment, and had been punished for it by the master: a superannuated old Grinder of savage disposition, who had been appointed schoolmaster because he didn\u0027t know anything, and wasn\u0027t fit for anything, and for whose cruel cane all chubby little boys had a perfect fascination.\u0027\n Thus it fell out that Biler, on his way home, sought unfrequented paths; and slunk along by narrow passages and back streets, to avoid his tormentors. Being compelled to emerge into the main road, his ill fortune brought him at last where a small party of boys, headed by a ferocious young butcher, were lying in wait for any means of pleasurable excitement that might happen. These, finding a Charitable Grinder in the midst of them - unaccountably delivered over, as it were, into their hands - set up a general yell and rushed upon him.\n But it so fell out likewise, that, at the same time, Polly, looking hopelessly along the road before her, after a good hour\u0027s walk, had said it was no use going any further, when suddenly she saw this sight. She no sooner saw it than, uttering a hasty exclamation, and giving Master Dombey to the black-eyed, she started to the rescue of her unhappy little son.\n Surprises, like misfortunes, rarely come alone. The astonished Susan Nipper and her two young charges were rescued by the bystanders from under the very wheels of a passing carriage before they knew what had happened; and at that moment (it was market day) a thundering alarm of \u0027Mad Bull!\u0027 was raised.\n With a wild confusion before her, of people running up and down, and shouting, and wheels running over them, and boys fighting, and mad bulls coming up, and the nurse in the midst of all these dangers being torn to pieces, Florence screamed and ran. She ran till she was exhausted, urging Susan to do the same; and then, stopping and wringing her hands as she remembered they had left the other nurse behind, found, with a sensation of terror not to be described, that she was quite alone.\n \u0027Susan! Susan!\u0027 cried Florence, clapping her hands in the very ecstasy of her alarm. \u0027Oh, where are they? where are they?\u0027\n \u0027Where are they?\u0027 said an old woman, coming hobbling across as fast as she could from the opposite side of the way. \u0027Why did you run away from \u0027em?\u0027\n \u0027I was frightened,\u0027 answered Florence. \u0027I didn\u0027t know what I did. I thought they were with me. Where are they?\u0027\n The old woman took her by the wrist, and said, \u0027I\u0027ll show you.\u0027\n She was a very ugly old woman, with red rims round her eyes, and a mouth that mumbled and chattered of itself when she was not speaking. She was miserably dressed, and carried some skins over her arm. She seemed to have followed Florence some little way at all events, for she had lost her breath; and this made her uglier still, as she stood trying to regain it: working her shrivelled yellow face and throat into all sorts of contortions.\n Florence was afraid of her, and looked, hesitating, up the street, of which she had almost reached the bottom. It was a solitary place - more a back road than a street - and there was no one in it but her- self and the old woman.\n \u0027You needn\u0027t be frightened now,\u0027 said the old woman, still holding her tight. \u0027Come along with me.\u0027\n \u0027I - I don\u0027t know you. What\u0027s your name?\u0027 asked Florence.\n \u0027Mrs Brown,\u0027 said the old woman. \u0027Good Mrs Brown.\u0027\n \u0027Are they near here?\u0027 asked Florence, beginning to be led away.\n \u0027Susan ain\u0027t far off,\u0027 said Good Mrs Brown; \u0027and the others are close to her.\u0027\n \u0027Is anybody hurt?\u0027 cried Florence.\n \u0027Not a bit of it,\u0027 said Good Mrs Brown.\n The child shed tears of delight on hearing this, and accompanied the old woman willingly; though she could not help glancing at her face as they went along - particularly at that industrious mouth - and wondering whether Bad Mrs Brown, if there were such a person, was at all like her.\n They had not gone far, but had gone by some very uncomfortable places, such as brick-fields and tile-yards, when the old woman turned down a dirty lane, where the mud lay in deep black ruts in the middle of the road. She stopped before a shabby little house, as closely shut up as a house that was full of cracks and crevices could be. Opening the door with a key she took out of her bonnet, she pushed the child before her into a back room, where there was a great heap of rags of different colours lying on the floor; a heap of bones, and a heap of sifted dust or cinders; but there was no furniture at all, and the walls and ceiling were quite black.\n The child became so terrified the she was stricken speechless, and looked as though about to swoon.\n \u0027Now don\u0027t be a young mule,\u0027 said Good Mrs Brown, reviving her with a shake. \u0027I\u0027m not a going to hurt you. Sit upon the rags.\u0027\n Florence obeyed her, holding out her folded hands, in mute supplication.\n \u0027I\u0027m not a going to keep you, even, above an hour,\u0027 said Mrs Brown. \u0027D\u0027ye understand what I say?\u0027\n The child answered with great difficulty, \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Then,\u0027 said Good Mrs Brown, taking her own seat on the bones, \u0027don\u0027t vex me. If you don\u0027t, I tell you I won\u0027t hurt you. But if you do, I\u0027ll kill you. I could have you killed at any time - even if you was in your own bed at home. Now let\u0027s know who you are, and what you are, and all about it.\u0027\n The old woman\u0027s threats and promises; the dread of giving her offence; and the habit, unusual to a child, but almost natural to Florence now, of being quiet, and repressing what she felt, and feared, and hoped; enabled her to do this bidding, and to tell her little history, or what she knew of it. Mrs Brown listened attentively, until she had finished.\n \u0027So your name\u0027s Dombey, eh?\u0027 said Mrs Brown.\n \u0027I want that pretty frock, Miss Dombey,\u0027 said Good Mrs Brown, \u0027and that little bonnet, and a petticoat or two, and anything else you can spare. Come! Take \u0027em off.\u0027\n Florence obeyed, as fast as her trembling hands would allow; keeping, all the while, a frightened eye on Mrs Brown. When she had divested herself of all the articles of apparel mentioned by that lady, Mrs B. examined them at leisure, and seemed tolerably well satisfied with their quality and value.\n \u0027Humph!\u0027 she said, running her eyes over the child\u0027s slight figure, \u0027I don\u0027t see anything else - except the shoes. I must have the shoes, Miss Dombey.\u0027\n Poor little Florence took them off with equal alacrity, only too glad to have any more means of conciliation about her. The old woman then produced some wretched substitutes from the bottom of the heap of rags, which she turned up for that purpose; together with a girl\u0027s cloak, quite worn out and very old; and the crushed remains of a bonnet that had probably been picked up from some ditch or dunghill. In this dainty raiment, she instructed Florence to dress herself; and as such preparation seemed a prelude to her release, the child complied with increased readiness, if possible.\n In hurriedly putting on the bonnet, if that may be called a bonnet which was more like a pad to carry loads on, she caught it in her hair which grew luxuriantly, and could not immediately disentangle it. Good Mrs Brown whipped out a large pair of scissors, and fell into an unaccountable state of excitement.\n \u0027Why couldn\u0027t you let me be!\u0027 said Mrs Brown, \u0027when I was contented? You little fool!\u0027\n \u0027I beg your pardon. I don\u0027t know what I have done,\u0027 panted Florence. \u0027I couldn\u0027t help it.\u0027\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t help it!\u0027 cried Mrs Brown. \u0027How do you expect I can help it? Why, Lord!\u0027 said the old woman, ruffling her curls with a furious pleasure, \u0027anybody but me would have had \u0027em off, first of all.\u0027 Florence was so relieved to find that it was only her hair and not her head which Mrs Brown coveted, that she offered no resistance or entreaty, and merely raised her mild eyes towards the face of that good soul.\n \u0027If I hadn\u0027t once had a gal of my own - beyond seas now- that was proud of her hair,\u0027 said Mrs Brown, \u0027I\u0027d have had every lock of it. She\u0027s far away, she\u0027s far away! Oho! Oho!\u0027\n Mrs Brown\u0027s was not a melodious cry, but, accompanied with a wild tossing up of her lean arms, it was full of passionate grief, and thrilled to the heart of Florence, whom it frightened more than ever. It had its part, perhaps, in saving her curls; for Mrs Brown, after hovering about her with the scissors for some moments, like a new kind of butterfly, bade her hide them under the bonnet and let no trace of them escape to tempt her. Having accomplished this victory over herself, Mrs Brown resumed her seat on the bones, and smoked a very short black pipe, mowing and mumbling all the time, as if she were eating the stem.\n When the pipe was smoked out, she gave the child a rabbit-skin to carry, that she might appear the more like her ordinary companion, and told her that she was now going to lead her to a public street whence she could inquire her way to her friends. But she cautioned her, with threats of summary and deadly vengeance in case of disobedience, not to talk to strangers, nor to repair to her own home (which may have been too near for Mrs Brown\u0027s convenience), but to her father\u0027s office in the City; also to wait at the street corner where she would be left, until the clock struck three. These directions Mrs Brown enforced with assurances that there would be potent eyes and ears in her employment cognizant of all she did; and these directions Florence promised faithfully and earnestly to observe.\n At length, Mrs Brown, issuing forth, conducted her changed and ragged little friend through a labyrinth of narrow streets and lanes and alleys, which emerged, after a long time, upon a stable yard, with a gateway at the end, whence the roar of a great thoroughfare made itself audible. Pointing out this gateway, and informing Florence that when the clocks struck three she was to go to the left, Mrs Brown, after making a parting grasp at her hair which seemed involuntary and quite beyond her own control, told her she knew what to do, and bade her go and do it: remembering that she was watched.\n With a lighter heart, but still sore afraid, Florence felt herself released, and tripped off to the corner. When she reached it, she looked back and saw the head of Good Mrs Brown peeping out of the low wooden passage, where she had issued her parting injunctions; likewise the fist of Good Mrs Brown shaking towards her. But though she often looked back afterwards - every minute, at least, in her nervous recollection of the old woman - she could not see her again.\n Florence remained there, looking at the bustle in the street, and more and more bewildered by it; and in the meanwhile the clocks appeared to have made up their minds never to strike three any more. At last the steeples rang out three o\u0027clock; there was one close by, so she couldn\u0027t be mistaken; and - after often looking over her shoulder, and often going a little way, and as often coming back again, lest the all-powerful spies of Mrs Brown should take offence - she hurried off, as fast as she could in her slipshod shoes, holding the rabbit-skin tight in her hand.\n All she knew of her father\u0027s offices was that they belonged to Dombey and Son, and that that was a great power belonging to the City. So she could only ask the way to Dombey and Son\u0027s in the City; and as she generally made inquiry of children - being afraid to ask grown people - she got very little satisfaction indeed. But by dint of asking her way to the City after a while, and dropping the rest of her inquiry for the present, she really did advance, by slow degrees, towards the heart of that great region which is governed by the terrible Lord Mayor.\n Tired of walking, repulsed and pushed about, stunned by the noise and confusion, anxious for her brother and the nurses, terrified by what she had undergone, and the prospect of encountering her angry father in such an altered state; perplexed and frightened alike by what had passed, and what was passing, and what was yet before her; Florence went upon her weary way with tearful eyes, and once or twice could not help stopping to ease her bursting heart by crying bitterly. But few people noticed her at those times, in the garb she wore: or if they did, believed that she was tutored to excite compassion, and passed on. Florence, too, called to her aid all the firmness and self-reliance of a character that her sad experience had prematurely formed and tried: and keeping the end she had in view steadily before her, steadily pursued it.\n It was full two hours later in the afternoon than when she had started on this strange adventure, when, escaping from the clash and clangour of a narrow street full of carts and waggons, she peeped into a kind of wharf or landing-place upon the river-side, where there were a great many packages, casks, and boxes, strewn about; a large pair of wooden scales; and a little wooden house on wheels, outside of which, looking at the neighbouring masts and boats, a stout man stood whistling, with his pen behind his ear, and his hands in his pockets, as if his day\u0027s work were nearly done.\n \u0027Now then! \u0027said this man, happening to turn round. \u0027We haven\u0027t got anything for you, little girl. Be off!\u0027\n \u0027If you please, is this the City?\u0027 asked the trembling daughter of the Dombeys.\n \u0027Ah! It\u0027s the City. You know that well enough, I daresay. Be off! We haven\u0027t got anything for you.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want anything, thank you,\u0027 was the timid answer. \u0027Except to know the way to Dombey and Son\u0027s.\u0027\n The man who had been strolling carelessly towards her, seemed surprised by this reply, and looking attentively in her face, rejoined:\n \u0027Why, what can you want with Dombey and Son\u0027s?\u0027\n \u0027To know the way there, if you please.\u0027\n The man looked at her yet more curiously, and rubbed the back of his head so hard in his wonderment that he knocked his own hat off.\n \u0027Joe!\u0027 he called to another man - a labourer- as he picked it up and put it on again.\n \u0027Joe it is!\u0027 said Joe.\n \u0027Where\u0027s that young spark of Dombey\u0027s who\u0027s been watching the shipment of them goods?\u0027\n \u0027Just gone, by t\u0027other gate,\u0027 said Joe.\n \u0027Call him back a minute.\u0027\n Joe ran up an archway, bawling as he went, and very soon returned\n with a blithe-looking boy.\n \u0027You\u0027re Dombey\u0027s jockey, ain\u0027t you?\u0027 said the first man.\n \u0027I\u0027m in Dombey\u0027s House, Mr Clark,\u0027 returned the boy.\n \u0027Look\u0027ye here, then,\u0027 said Mr Clark.\n Obedient to the indication of Mr Clark\u0027s hand, the boy approached towards Florence, wondering, as well he might, what he had to do with her. But she, who had heard what passed, and who, besides the relief of so suddenly considering herself safe at her journey\u0027s end, felt reassured beyond all measure by his lively youthful face and manner, ran eagerly up to him, leaving one of the slipshod shoes upon the ground and caught his hand in both of hers.\n \u0027I am lost, if you please!\u0027 said Florence.\n \u0027Lost!\u0027 cried the boy.\n \u0027Yes, I was lost this morning, a long way from here - and I have had my clothes taken away, since - and I am not dressed in my own now - and my name is Florence Dombey, my little brother\u0027s only sister - and, oh dear, dear, take care of me, if you please!\u0027 sobbed Florence, giving full vent to the childish feelings she had so long suppressed, and bursting into tears. At the same time her miserable bonnet falling off, her hair came tumbling down about her face: moving to speechless admiration and commiseration, young Walter, nephew of Solomon Gills, Ships\u0027 Instrument-maker in general.\n Mr Clark stood rapt in amazement: observing under his breath, I never saw such a start on this wharf before. Walter picked up the shoe, and put it on the little foot as the Prince in the story might have fitted Cinderella\u0027s slipper on. He hung the rabbit-skin over his left arm; gave the right to Florence; and felt, not to say like Richard Whittington - that is a tame comparison - but like Saint George of England, with the dragon lying dead before him.\n \u0027Don\u0027t cry, Miss Dombey,\u0027 said Walter, in a transport of\n enthusiasm.\n \u0027What a wonderful thing for me that I am here! You are as safe now as if you were guarded by a whole boat\u0027s crew of picked men from a man-of-war. Oh, don\u0027t cry.\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t cry any more,\u0027 said Florence. \u0027I am only crying for joy.\u0027\n \u0027Crying for joy!\u0027 thought Walter, \u0027and I\u0027m the cause of it! Come along, Miss Dombey. There\u0027s the other shoe off now! Take mine, Miss Dombey.\u0027\n \u0027No, no, no,\u0027 said Florence, checking him in the act of impetuously\n pulling off his own. \u0027These do better. These do very well.\u0027\n \u0027Why, to be sure,\u0027 said Walter, glancing at her foot, \u0027mine are a mile too large. What am I thinking about! You never could walk in mine! Come along, Miss Dombey. Let me see the villain who will dare molest you now.\u0027\n So Walter, looking immensely fierce, led off Florence, looking very happy; and they went arm-in-arm along the streets, perfectly indifferent to any astonishment that their appearance might or did excite by the way.\n It was growing dark and foggy, and beginning to rain too; but they cared nothing for this: being both wholly absorbed in the late adventures of Florence, which she related with the innocent good faith and confidence of her years, while Walter listened as if, far from the mud and grease of Thames Street, they were rambling alone among the broad leaves and tall trees of some desert island in the tropics - as he very likely fancied, for the time, they were.\n \u0027Have we far to go?\u0027 asked Florence at last, lilting up her eyes to her companion\u0027s face.\n \u0027Ah! By-the-bye,\u0027 said Walter, stopping, \u0027let me see; where are we? Oh! I know. But the offices are shut up now, Miss Dombey. There\u0027s nobody there. Mr Dombey has gone home long ago. I suppose we must go home too? or, stay. Suppose I take you to my Uncle\u0027s, where I live - it\u0027s very near here - and go to your house in a coach to tell them you are safe, and bring you back some clothes. Won\u0027t that be best?\u0027\n \u0027I think so,\u0027 answered Florence. \u0027Don\u0027t you? What do you think?\u0027\n As they stood deliberating in the street, a man passed them, who glanced quickly at Walter as he went by, as if he recognised him; but seeming to correct that first impression, he passed on without stopping.\n \u0027Why, I think it\u0027s Mr Carker,\u0027 said Walter. \u0027Carker in our House. Not Carker our Manager, Miss Dombey - the other Carker; the Junior - Halloa! Mr Carker!\u0027\n \u0027Is that Walter Gay?\u0027 said the other, stopping and returning. \u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it, with such a strange companion.\n As he stood near a lamp, listening with surprise to Walter\u0027s hurried explanation, he presented a remarkable contrast to the two youthful figures arm-in-arm before him. He was not old, but his hair was white; his body was bent, or bowed as if by the weight of some great trouble: and there were deep lines in his worn and melancholy face. The fire of his eyes, the expression of his features, the very voice in which he spoke, were all subdued and quenched, as if the spirit within him lay in ashes. He was respectably, though very plainly dressed, in black; but his clothes, moulded to the general character of his figure, seemed to shrink and abase themselves upon him, and to join in the sorrowful solicitation which the whole man from head to foot expressed, to be left unnoticed, and alone in his humility.\n And yet his interest in youth and hopefulness was not extinguished with the other embers of his soul, for he watched the boy\u0027s earnest countenance as he spoke with unusual sympathy, though with an inexplicable show of trouble and compassion, which escaped into his looks, however hard he strove to hold it prisoner. When Walter, in conclusion, put to him the question he had put to Florence, he still stood glancing at him with the same expression, as if he had read some fate upon his face, mournfully at variance with its present brightness.\n \u0027What do you advise, Mr Carker?\u0027 said Walter, smiling. \u0027You always give me good advice, you know, when you do speak to me. That\u0027s not often, though.\u0027\n \u0027I think your own idea is the best,\u0027 he answered: looking from Florence to Walter, and back again.\n \u0027Mr Carker,\u0027 said Walter, brightening with a generous thought, \u0027Come! Here\u0027s a chance for you. Go you to Mr Dombey\u0027s, and be the messenger of good news. It may do you some good, Sir. I\u0027ll remain at home. You shall go.\u0027\n \u0027I!\u0027 returned the other.\n \u0027Yes. Why not, Mr Carker?\u0027 said the boy.\n He merely shook him by the hand in answer; he seemed in a manner ashamed and afraid even to do that; and bidding him good-night, and advising him to make haste, turned away.\n \u0027Come, Miss Dombey,\u0027 said Walter, looking after him as they turned away also, \u0027we\u0027ll go to my Uncle\u0027s as quick as we can. Did you ever hear Mr Dombey speak of Mr Carker the Junior, Miss Florence?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 returned the child, mildly, \u0027I don\u0027t often hear Papa speak.\u0027\n \u0027Ah! true! more shame for him,\u0027 thought Walter. After a minute\u0027s pause, during which he had been looking down upon the gentle patient little face moving on at his side, he said, \u0027The strangest man, Mr Carker the Junior is, Miss Florence, that ever you heard of. If you could understand what an extraordinary interest he takes in me, and yet how he shuns me and avoids me; and what a low place he holds in our office, and how he is never advanced, and never complains, though year after year he sees young men passed over his head, and though his brother (younger than he is), is our head Manager, you would be as much puzzled about him as I am.\u0027\n As Florence could hardly be expected to understand much about it, Walter bestirred himself with his accustomed boyish animation and restlessness to change the subject; and one of the unfortunate shoes coming off again opportunely, proposed to carry Florence to his uncle\u0027s in his arms. Florence, though very tired, laughingly declined the proposal, lest he should let her fall; and as they were already near the wooden Midshipman, and as Walter went on to cite various precedents, from shipwrecks and other moving accidents, where younger boys than he had triumphantly rescued and carried off older girls than Florence, they were still in full conversation about it when they arrived at the Instrument-maker\u0027s door.\n \u0027Holloa, Uncle Sol!\u0027 cried Walter, bursting into the shop, and speaking incoherently and out of breath, from that time forth, for the rest of the evening. \u0027Here\u0027s a wonderful adventure! Here\u0027s Mr Dombey\u0027s daughter lost in the streets, and robbed of her clothes by an old witch of a woman - found by me - brought home to our parlour to rest - look here!\u0027\n \u0027Good Heaven!\u0027 said Uncle Sol, starting back against his favourite compass-case. \u0027It can\u0027t be! Well, I - \u0027\n \u0027No, nor anybody else,\u0027 said Walter, anticipating the rest. \u0027Nobody would, nobody could, you know. Here! just help me lift the little sofa near the fire, will you, Uncle Sol - take care of the plates - cut some dinner for her, will you, Uncle - throw those shoes under the grate. Miss Florence - put your feet on the fender to dry - how damp they are - here\u0027s an adventure, Uncle, eh? - God bless my soul, how hot I am!\u0027\n Solomon Gills was quite as hot, by sympathy, and in excessive bewilderment. He patted Florence\u0027s head, pressed her to eat, pressed her to drink, rubbed the soles of her feet with his pocket-handkerchief heated at the fire, followed his locomotive nephew with his eyes, and ears, and had no clear perception of anything except that he was being constantly knocked against and tumbled over by that excited young gentleman, as he darted about the room attempting to accomplish twenty things at once, and doing nothing at all.\n \u0027Here, wait a minute, Uncle,\u0027 he continued, catching up a candle, \u0027till I run upstairs, and get another jacket on, and then I\u0027ll be off. I say, Uncle, isn\u0027t this an adventure?\u0027\n \u0027My dear boy,\u0027 said Solomon, who, with his spectacles on his forehead and the great chronometer in his pocket, was incessantly oscillating between Florence on the sofa, and his nephew in all parts of the parlour, \u0027it\u0027s the most extraordinary - \u0027\n \u0027No, but do, Uncle, please - do, Miss Florence - dinner, you know, Uncle.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, yes, yes,\u0027 cried Solomon, cutting instantly into a leg of mutton, as if he were catering for a giant. \u0027I\u0027ll take care of her, Wally! I understand. Pretty dear! Famished, of course. You go and get ready. Lord bless me! Sir Richard Whittington thrice Lord Mayor of London.\u0027\n Walter was not very long in mounting to his lofty garret and descending from it, but in the meantime Florence, overcome by fatigue, had sunk into a doze before the fire. The short interval of quiet, though only a few minutes in duration, enabled Solomon Gills so far to collect his wits as to make some little arrangements for her comfort, and to darken the room, and to screen her from the blaze. Thus, when the boy returned, she was sleeping peacefully.\n \u0027That\u0027s capital!\u0027 he whispered, giving Solomon such a hug that it squeezed a new expression into his face. \u0027Now I\u0027m off. I\u0027ll just take a crust of bread with me, for I\u0027m very hungry - and don\u0027t wake her, Uncle Sol.\u0027\n \u0027No, no,\u0027 said Solomon. \u0027Pretty child.\u0027\n \u0027Pretty, indeed!\u0027 cried Walter. \u0027I never saw such a face, Uncle Sol. Now I\u0027m off.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Solomon, greatly relieved.\n \u0027I say, Uncle Sol,\u0027 cried Walter, putting his face in at the door.\n \u0027Here he is again,\u0027 said Solomon.\n \u0027How does she look now?\u0027\n \u0027Quite happy,\u0027 said Solomon.\n \u0027That\u0027s famous! now I\u0027m off.\u0027\n \u0027I hope you are,\u0027 said Solomon to himself.\n \u0027I say, Uncle Sol,\u0027 cried Walter, reappearing at the door.\n \u0027Here he is again!\u0027 said Solomon.\n \u0027We met Mr Carker the Junior in the street, queerer than ever. He bade me good-bye, but came behind us here - there\u0027s an odd thing! - for when we reached the shop door, I looked round, and saw him going quietly away, like a servant who had seen me home, or a faithful dog. How does she look now, Uncle?\u0027\n \u0027Pretty much the same as before, Wally,\u0027 replied Uncle Sol.\n \u0027That\u0027s right. Now I am off!\u0027\n And this time he really was: and Solomon Gills, with no appetite for dinner, sat on the opposite side of the fire, watching Florence in her slumber, building a great many airy castles of the most fantastic architecture; and looking, in the dim shade, and in the close vicinity of all the instruments, like a magician disguised in a Welsh wig and a suit of coffee colour, who held the child in an enchanted sleep.\n In the meantime, Walter proceeded towards Mr Dombey\u0027s house at a pace seldom achieved by a hack horse from the stand; and yet with his head out of window every two or three minutes, in impatient remonstrance with the driver. Arriving at his journey\u0027s end, he leaped out, and breathlessly announcing his errand to the servant, followed him straight into the library, we there was a great confusion of tongues, and where Mr Dombey, his sister, and Miss Tox, Richards, and Nipper, were all congregated together.\n \u0027Oh! I beg your pardon, Sir,\u0027 said Walter, rushing up to him, \u0027but I\u0027m happy to say it\u0027s all right, Sir. Miss Dombey\u0027s found!\u0027\n The boy with his open face, and flowing hair, and sparkling eyes, panting with pleasure and excitement, was wonderfully opposed to Mr Dombey, as he sat confronting him in his library chair.\n \u0027I told you, Louisa, that she would certainly be found,\u0027 said Mr Dombey, looking slightly over his shoulder at that lady, who wept in company with Miss Tox. \u0027Let the servants know that no further steps are necessary. This boy who brings the information, is young Gay, from the office. How was my daughter found, Sir? I know how she was lost.\u0027 Here he looked majestically at Richards. \u0027But how was she found? Who found her?\u0027\n \u0027Why, I believe I found Miss Dombey, Sir,\u0027 said Walter modestly, \u0027at least I don\u0027t know that I can claim the merit of having exactly found her, Sir, but I was the fortunate instrument of - \u0027\n \u0027What do you mean, Sir,\u0027 interrupted Mr Dombey, regarding the boy\u0027s evident pride and pleasure in his share of the transaction with an instinctive dislike, \u0027by not having exactly found my daughter, and by being a fortunate instrument? Be plain and coherent, if you please.\u0027\n It was quite out of Walter\u0027s power to be coherent; but he rendered himself as explanatory as he could, in his breathless state, and stated why he had come alone.\n \u0027You hear this, girl?\u0027 said Mr Dombey sternly to the black-eyed. \u0027Take what is necessary, and return immediately with this young man to fetch Miss Florence home. Gay, you will be rewarded to-morrow.\n \u0027Oh! thank you, Sir,\u0027 said Walter. \u0027You are very kind. I\u0027m sure I was not thinking of any reward, Sir.\u0027\n \u0027You are a boy,\u0027 said Mr Dombey, suddenly and almost fiercely; \u0027and what you think of, or affect to think of, is of little consequence. You have done well, Sir. Don\u0027t undo it. Louisa, please to give the lad some wine.\u0027\n Mr Dombey\u0027s glance followed Walter Gay with sharp disfavour, as he left the room under the pilotage of Mrs Chick; and it may be that his mind\u0027s eye followed him with no greater relish, as he rode back to his Uncle\u0027s with Miss Susan Nipper.\n There they found that Florence, much refreshed by sleep, had dined, and greatly improved the acquaintance of Solomon Gills, with whom she was on terms of perfect confidence and ease. The black-eyed (who had cried so much that she might now be called the red-eyed, and who was very silent and depressed) caught her in her arms without a word of contradiction or reproach, and made a very hysterical meeting of it. Then converting the parlour, for the nonce, into a private tiring room, she dressed her, with great care, in proper clothes; and presently led her forth, as like a Dombey as her natural disqualifications admitted of her being made.\n \u0027Good-night!\u0027 said Florence, running up to Solomon. \u0027You have been very good to me.\n Old Sol was quite delighted, and kissed her like her grand-father.\n \u0027Good-night, Walter! Good-bye!\u0027 said Florence.\n \u0027Good-bye!\u0027 said Walter, giving both his hands.\n \u0027I\u0027ll never forget you,\u0027 pursued Florence. \u0027No! indeed I never will. Good-bye, Walter!\u0027 In the innocence of her grateful heart, the child lifted up her face to his. Walter, bending down his own, raised it again, all red and burning; and looked at Uncle Sol, quite sheepishly.\n \u0027Where\u0027s Walter?\u0027 \u0027Good-night, Walter!\u0027 \u0027Good-bye, Walter!\u0027 \u0027Shake hands once more, Walter!\u0027 This was still Florence\u0027s cry, after she was shut up with her little maid, in the coach. And when the coach at length moved off, Walter on the door-step gaily turned the waving of her handkerchief, while the wooden Midshipman behind him seemed, like himself, intent upon that coach alone, excluding all the other passing coaches from his observation.\n In good time Mr Dombey\u0027s mansion was gained again, and again there was a noise of tongues in the library. Again, too, the coach was ordered to wait - \u0027for Mrs Richards,\u0027 one of Susan\u0027s fellow-servants ominously whispered, as she passed with Florence.\n The entrance of the lost child made a slight sensation, but not much. Mr Dombey, who had never found her, kissed her once upon the forehead, and cautioned her not to run away again, or wander anywhere with treacherous attendants. Mrs Chick stopped in her lamentations on the corruption of human nature, even when beckoned to the paths of virtue by a Charitable Grinder; and received her with a welcome something short of the reception due to none but perfect Dombeys. Miss Tox regulated her feelings by the models before her. Richards, the culprit Richards, alone poured out her heart in broken words of welcome, and bowed herself over the little wandering head as if she really loved it.\n \u0027Ah, Richards!\u0027 said Mrs Chick, with a sigh. \u0027It would have been much more satisfactory to those who wish to think well of their fellow creatures, and much more becoming in you, if you had shown some proper feeling, in time, for the little child that is now going to be prematurely deprived of its natural nourishment.\n \u0027Cut off,\u0027 said Miss Tox, in a plaintive whisper, \u0027from one common fountain!\u0027\n \u0027If it was ungrateful case,\u0027 said Mrs Chick, solemnly, \u0027and I had your reflections, Richards, I should feel as if the Charitable Grinders\u0027 dress would blight my child, and the education choke him.\u0027\n For the matter of that - but Mrs Chick didn\u0027t know it - he had been pretty well blighted by the dress already; and as to the education, even its retributive effect might be produced in time, for it was a storm of sobs and blows.\n \u0027Louisa!\u0027 said Mr Dombey. \u0027It is not necessary to prolong these observations. The woman is discharged and paid. You leave this house, Richards, for taking my son - my son,\u0027 said Mr Dombey, emphatically repeating these two words, \u0027into haunts and into society which are not to be thought of without a shudder. As to the accident which befel Miss Florence this morning, I regard that as, in one great sense, a happy and fortunate circumstance; inasmuch as, but for that occurrence, I never could have known - and from your own lips too - of what you had been guilty. I think, Louisa, the other nurse, the young person,\u0027 here Miss Nipper sobbed aloud, \u0027being so much younger, and necessarily influenced by Paul\u0027s nurse, may remain. Have the goodness to direct that this woman\u0027s coach is paid to\u0027 - Mr Dombey stopped and winced - \u0027to Staggs\u0027s Gardens.\u0027\n Polly moved towards the door, with Florence holding to her dress, and crying to her in the most pathetic manner not to go away. It was a dagger in the haughty father\u0027s heart, an arrow in his brain, to see how the flesh and blood he could not disown clung to this obscure stranger, and he sitting by. Not that he cared to whom his daughter turned, or from whom turned away. The swift sharp agony struck through him, as he thought of what his son might do.\n His son cried lustily that night, at all events. Sooth to say, poor Paul had better reason for his tears than sons of that age often have, for he had lost his second mother - his first, so far as he knew - by a stroke as sudden as that natural affliction which had darkened the beginning of his life. At the same blow, his sister too, who cried herself to sleep so mournfully, had lost as good and true a friend. But that is quite beside the question. Let us waste no words about it.\n \n 到了早上，波利由于顾虑重重，心中十分忐忑不安；若不是她那位黑眼睛的女伴不断怂恿，她就会断绝这次外出远走的各种念头，而改为提出正式申请，请求在董贝先生屋顶的森严的阴影下，与147号见见面。可是苏珊本人有意进行这次短途旅行；她像托尼·拉姆金①一样，能够用坚强的意志忍受另人的沮丧失意，但却决不能容忍让自己的希望落空；于是她对波利的第二种想法巧妙地提出了许多疑问，对原先的打算则巧妙地发表了许多支持的意见，所以几乎当董贝先生这位绅士一转开他庄严的后背，沿着平日的道路向城里进发的时候，他的一无所知的儿子就已经上了前往斯塔格斯花园的路了。\n

这个声音悦耳的地方座落在一个郊区，斯塔格斯花园的居民们都管它叫做坎伯林镇；有一种为了查找起来有趣和方便，印在手绢上供外地游客使用的伦敦地图，不无理由地把这个地名缩写为坎登镇。两位保姆在她们所抚养的孩子的陪伴下，就向这里走去。理查兹当然抱着保罗，苏珊则拉着小弗洛伦斯的手，而且不时在她认为对她指挥合适的时候，猛拉她一下，狠戳她一下。\n 这个时期发生的大地震，第一次震动就把整个地区都震裂了，一直达到它的中心。到处都可以看到地震留下的痕迹。房屋倒塌了；街道完全裂开和堵塞了；地底下被挖掘成深深的凹坑和沟渠；大堆大堆的泥土高高堆积；建筑物由于基础遭到破坏，动摇不牢，正用大根的木头支撑着。这里，翻倒在地、杂乱一团的大车横七竖八地躺在一座峻峭的非自然的小山底下；那里，珍贵的铁器毫无条理地浸泡在偶然形成的池塘中，腐蚀生锈。到处是不通向任何地方的桥梁，完全不能通行的大路，失去一半高度、像巴别塔①一样的烟囱，在最意想不到的场所临时搭建的木房子和围栏，破烂的住房的骨架，未建成的墙和拱门的断片，一堆堆的脚手架，杂乱无章的砖块，巨人般的起重机以及跨立在空处的三脚架。这里有十几万个没有完成的形状和实体，散乱地混杂在一起，上下倒立，深埋在地下，高耸在空中，腐烂在水里，像梦一样地难以理解。地震通常的伴随物——温泉和火焰喷发，对整个场景增添上一份混乱。在颓垣断壁之内，沸腾的水上下滚动，发出了嘶嘶的声音，从那里也发出了火焰的闪耀与怒号；山丘般的灰烬堵塞了来往通道，而且完全改变了本地的法律与风俗。\n

①巴别塔（Babeltower）：圣经《创世纪》中的故事说：在洪水大劫之后，挪亚的子孙成群向东迁移，走到示拿地方，发现一片广袤的原野，就决定在那里住下来，并在那里建一座城，城中建一座塔，塔顶通天；不久，那塔节节升高，直入云霄。但后来耶和华变乱了他们的口音，使他们从本来只说一种语言变为说出各种各样的语言；由于语言不通，停工待料，人们逐渐走散，那座城和那座塔也就半途而废了。半途而废的原因在于语言的变乱。“变乱”一词在希伯来语中读作“巴别”，因此人们就管那座城叫巴别城，管那座塔叫巴别塔。\n 简单地说，尚未峻工、尚未通车的铁路正在修建中，它从极端杂乱的中心，沿着它的文明与进步的宏伟路线，平静地、慢慢地向远处延伸。\n 可是到现在为止，附近的居民还羞于承认这条铁路。一两个大胆的投机商已经在筹划修建街道；有一位已经动工修建了一点儿，但却在泥淖与灰烬中间停顿下来，需要再考虑考虑。有一个新开张的小酒店，店里散发着新鲜的灰浆与胶料的气味，店前只有一片空地，它已经把铁路纹章画在它的招牌上了；但这可能是个未经深思熟虑、草草创办的企业——这时它希望能卖些酒给工人喝。同样，“掘路工人之家”设在一个啤酒店里；一家开设好久的火腿与牛肉店同样由于直接的和可以受到欢迎的营利动机，已改变为铁路饮食店，每天卖出一只烤猪腿。公寓老板也同样讨人喜欢，并且由于同样原因不能受到人们的信任。人们的信心增长得很慢。在铁路线开始的地方有霉臭难闻的田野、牛棚、粪堆、垃圾堆、水沟、菜园、凉亭和敲打地毯的场地。在牡蛎季节中的牡蛎壳，在龙虾季节中的龙虾壳，在所有季节中的破碎的陶器和枯萎的卷心菜叶，像小坟般一堆一堆地侵占了铁路线的路堤。标竿、围栏、对入侵者的旧警告牌、简陋房屋的后背和长着衰败植物的地块瞪眼看着这条铁路，看得它局促不安。没有什么由于它而比过去更好，或认为比过去好。如果附近可怜的荒地能够发笑的话，那么它也会像许多可怜的邻居一样，对它冷嘲热讽一番的。\n 斯塔格斯花园异乎寻常地令人难以置信。这里有一小排房屋，房屋前面是一片污秽的土地；房屋与房屋之间被旧的门、楼板、涂了柏油的帆布片和枯死的矮树丛隔开，缝隙里塞上没有底的白铁壶和不堪使用的铁制火炉围栏。斯塔格斯花园的园丁们在这里栽培红豆，饲养家禽、兔子，建造简陋的凉亭（其中一个是一条旧的小船），晾晒衣服，叼着烟斗吸烟。有些人说，斯塔格斯花园是为了纪念一位已故的资本家斯塔格斯先生而命名的，这位先生建造它是为了供他消遣娱乐。另有一些生性喜爱乡村的人认为，这个名称的由来应该追溯到安逸幽静、田园诗般的那段时光，那时候称为斯塔格斯的长角的兽群常常到荫凉的效野栖身安息。不论实际情况怎么样，当地的居民们都把斯塔格斯花园看作是一个神圣的园林，不许被铁路消灭；他们深信它的寿命必定会比这类可笑的发明长得多，所以住在角落里的扫烟囱的工长（大家都认为他在花园的当地政治中坐第一把交椅）曾经当众宣布，在铁路举行通车典礼的时候（如果它有一天真能通车的话），他的两个孩子将会攀登上他的房屋的烟道，按照他的指示，嘲笑、欢呼他们想要消灭斯塔格斯花园的计划已告失败。\n 小保罗现在就由命运和理查兹带往这个亵渎神明的地方；董贝先生的妹妹至今还对她的哥哥隐瞒着它的名称。\n “那就是我的家，苏珊，”波利指着它，说道。\n “真的吗，理查兹大嫂？”苏珊谦和地说道。\n “站在门口的是我的妹妹杰迈玛，准没错！”波利喊道，“她手里抱着的是我自己可爱的宝贝娃娃！”\n 这个情景在波利的急切难耐的心情上增添了一对十分宽阔的翅膀，因此她开始沿着花园奔跑过去，蹦跳到杰迈玛的身边，一转眼的工夫就跟她的妹妹交换了婴孩；那位年轻的姑娘大吃一惊，董贝的继承人似乎是从云霄中降落到她的怀里一样。\n “啊，波利！”杰迈玛喊道。“瞧你！你真让我吓了一跳！谁可曾料得到啊！进来吧，波利！你看去气色真好！孩子们见到你准要乐疯了，准是的，波利！”\n 如果我们从他们发出的喧闹的声音、从他们向波利猛冲过去，把她拽到壁炉边一张矮椅子里的情景来判断的话，那么他们确实是这样的。她坐在那里，她自己那张诚实的苹果脸立刻变成了一串小苹果的中心；他们红润的脸颊全都紧挨着它，显然全都是同一株树的产物。至于波利本人，她也像孩子们一样吵吵嚷嚷，热情激动。直到她完全喘不过气来，她的头发披散到通红的脸上，她为施洗礼而缝制的新衣服被揉得很皱，这时候混乱才慢慢平息下来。甚至在这时候，第二个最小的图德尔还依旧坐在她的膝盖上，两只手紧紧地抱着她的脖子；第三个最小的图德尔则爬到椅背上；一条腿在空中摆动，作出拼命的努力，想从边角里去吻她。\n “看！一位漂亮的小姐来看你们啦，”波利说道，“看她多么安静！她是个多么漂亮的小姐啊，是不是？”\n 这是指弗洛伦斯，她一直站在门边，不是没有注意到刚才发生的情形，这时她吸引了嫩枝们对她的注意，而且，同样幸运的是，随后波利就正式介绍尼珀；尼珀姑娘很有些担心，她已经被怠慢了。\n “啊，请进来坐一会儿吧，苏珊！”波利说道。“这是我的妹妹杰迈玛，这就是。杰迈玛，要是没有苏珊·尼珀，我自己真不知道该怎么办；要是没有她，那么我现在就不会在这里啦。”\n “啊，请坐吧，尼珀姑娘，”杰迈玛说道。\n 苏珊庄严地、十分讲究礼节地在一张椅子中的一个极小的角落里坐下。\n “我这一辈子从来还没有见到谁能像现在见到您这么高兴，尼珀姑娘，真是从来没有过，”杰迈玛说道。\n 苏珊轻松下来，往椅子里多坐进去一点，亲切地微笑着。\n “请把您的帽带解开吧，尼珀姑娘，随便些，就像到您自己家里一样，”杰迈玛请求道。“我担心您还没有住过这样破旧的地方，不过我想您一定会包涵的。”\n 这种表示敬意的态度使黑眼睛软化了，她把从身旁跑过去的图德尔小姑娘抱到膝盖上，立刻给她唱起到班伯里①十字架去旅行的歌曲。\n --------\n ①班伯里（Banbury）：英格兰牛津郡查韦尔（Charwell）区城镇。\n “可是我可爱的儿子在哪里呢？”波利问道。“我可怜的小家伙？我跑这么多的路到这里来就是想看看穿上新衣服的他呀。”\n “啊，真可惜！”杰迈玛喊道。“他回来听说他妈妈曾经回家来过，一定会万分伤心的。他现在在学校里呢，波利。”\n “已经到学校里去了吗？”\n “是的。他昨天是头一天去的，生怕晚去就会丢掉一些功课学不上。不过今天只上半天课，波利；如果你——你和尼珀姑娘，能等到他回来就好了，”杰迈玛说道，她及时地注意照顾到黑眼睛的面子。“他看上去怎么样，杰迈玛，愿上帝保佑他！”波利结结巴巴地说道。\n “唔，他看上去确实并不像你想的那么坏，”杰迈玛回答道。\n “啊！”波利激动地说道，“我知道他的腿一定太短了。”\n “他的腿确实是短，”杰迈玛答道，“特别是从后面看；但它们会一天天长起来的，波利。”\n 这个安慰是一种指望于未来的、过程缓慢的安慰；但是给予这个安慰时愉快的口吻与善良的心意使它具有一种它本来并不含有的价值。在片刻的沉默之后，波利用一种比较轻松愉快的语气问道：\n “爸爸在哪里呢，亲爱的杰迈玛？”因为在家里通常都是用这个家族的称呼来指图德尔先生的。\n “哎呀，你看！”杰迈玛说道，“又是真可惜！爸爸今天早上把晚饭带着走的，要到夜里才回来。不过他经常谈起你，波利，还经常把关于你的一些事情讲给孩子们听；他是世界上最和气、最耐性、脾气最好的人。他过去一直是这样，将来也将会是这样的！”\n “谢谢你，杰迈玛，”纯朴的波利喊道；这番话使她高兴，可是人不在又使她失望。\n “啊，你不用谢我，波利，”她的妹妹在她的脸颊上使劲地吻了一下，说道，一边兴高采烈地舞弄着小保罗。“我有时也这样说到你，心里也是这样想的。”\n 虽然感到双重的失望，但却不可能把受到这样热烈欢迎的一次访问看作是一次失败；所以两姐妹就满怀希望地谈起家常事务，谈到拜勒，谈到他的弟弟和妹妹们；在这段时间中，黑眼睛在到班伯里十字架去的旅行已来回了好几趟以后，就细细地观察室内的家具、荷兰钟、碗柜、壁炉台上的城堡，城堡里有红色的和绿色的窗子，里面点一根烛头就可以把它们照亮；还有一对黑色的丝绒制的小猫，每只嘴里都衔着一只贵妇人用的网状手提包，斯塔格斯花园里的人们都认为这是仿制艺术的珍品。不久，唯恐黑眼睛会突然情不自禁地说出挖苦的话来，谈话就转到大家都能参加的一般内容，于是那位年轻的姑娘就把她所知道的有关董贝先生的一切，如他的前途，他的家庭，他的事业和他的性格，都向杰迈玛简略地叙述了一番。她也详详细细、一件不漏地列举了她个人全部服装的清单，还稍稍谈到她的主要的亲戚和朋友。把这些话开诚布公地说出，不再积压在心头以后，她吃起河虾，喝起黑啤酒来，这时心情愉快，随时准备为永恒的友谊而发愿起誓。\n 小弗洛伦斯在利用这个机会方面也不落后。因为当小图德尔们陪伴她去看毒菌和花园里的其他新奇事物时，她和他们一起专心一意地在一个角落里由积水形成的一个绿色的小池塘中，着手修建一个临时防波堤。当她仍在忙忙碌碌地从事这项劳动时，苏珊把她寻找到了。虽然在河虾的影响下，苏珊已变得通达人情，可是她仍怀有强烈的责任感，所以她一边给弗洛伦斯洗脸洗手，一边针对她这种变坏了的品性，向她发表了一篇训诫性的谈话；她一边说，一边用拳头打她，作为标点符号，并预言她将使她全家的老人都伤心而死。波利与杰迈玛在楼上相当长久地谈了一些有关金钱方面的私房话，稍稍耽搁了一些时间；在这之后，她们就重新交换了婴孩——因为波利一直抱着她亲生的孩子，杰迈玛则抱着小保罗——，来访的人于是也告辞了。\n 但是首先是把年轻的图德尔们（他们是一个意向善良的骗局的牺牲品）哄骗到一个邻近的零售店里去，表面上的理由是让他们把一个便士在那里花掉。障碍一经排除，波利就拔脚逃走了；杰迈玛在她的后面大声叫喊说，她们回去时只要稍稍绕点路，沿着去城\n \n
