{"id":3780,"no":32,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"The Wooden Midshipman goes to Pieces Honest Captain Cuttle, as the weeks flew over him in his fortified retreat, by no means abated any of his prudent provisions against surprise, because of the non-appearance of the enemy. The Captain argued that his present security was too profound and wonderful to endure much longer; he knew that when the wind stood in a fair quarter, the weathercock was seldom nailed there; and he was too well acquainted with the determined and dauntless character of Mrs MacStinger, to doubt that that heroic woman had devoted herself to the task of his discovery and capture. Trembling beneath the weight of these reasons, Captain Cuttle lived a very close and retired life; seldom stirring abroad until after dark; venturing even then only into the obscurest streets; never going forth at all on Sundays; and both within and without the walls of his retreat, avoiding bonnets, as if they were worn by raging lions. The Captain never dreamed that in the event of his being pounced upon by Mrs MacStinger, in his walks, it would be possible to offer resistance. He felt that it could not be done. He saw himself, in his mind\u0027s eye, put meekly in a hackney-coach, and carried off to his old lodgings. He foresaw that, once immured there, he was a lost man: his hat gone; Mrs MacStinger watchful of him day and night; reproaches heaped upon his head, before the infant family; himself the guilty object of suspicion and distrust; an ogre in the children\u0027s eyes, and in their mother\u0027s a detected traitor. A violent perspiration, and a lowness of spirits, always came over the Captain as this gloomy picture presented itself to his imagination. It generally did so previous to his stealing out of doors at night for air and exercise. Sensible of the risk he ran, the Captain took leave of Rob, at those times, with the solemnity which became a man who might never return: exhorting him, in the event of his (the Captain\u0027s) being lost sight of, for a time, to tread in the paths of virtue, and keep the brazen instruments well polished. But not to throw away a chance; and to secure to himself a means, in case of the worst, of holding communication with the external world; Captain Cuttle soon conceived the happy idea of teaching Rob the Grinder some secret signal, by which that adherent might make his presence and fidelity known to his commander, in the hour of adversity. After much cogitation, the Captain decided in favour of instructing him to whistle the marine melody, \u0027Oh cheerily, cheerily!\u0027 and Rob the Grinder attaining a point as near perfection in that accomplishment as a landsman could hope to reach, the Captain impressed these mysterious instructions on his mind: \u0027Now, my lad, stand by! If ever I\u0027m took - \u0027 \u0027Took, Captain!\u0027 interposed Rob, with his round eyes wide open. \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Captain Cuttle darkly, \u0027if ever I goes away, meaning to come back to supper, and don\u0027t come within hail again, twenty-four hours arter my loss, go you to Brig Place and whistle that \u0027ere tune near my old moorings - not as if you was a meaning of it, you understand, but as if you\u0027d drifted there, promiscuous. If I answer in that tune, you sheer off, my lad, and come back four-and-twenty hours arterwards; if I answer in another tune, do you stand off and on, and wait till I throw out further signals. Do you understand them orders, now?\u0027 \u0027What am I to stand off and on of, Captain?\u0027 inquired Rob. \u0027The horse-road?\u0027 \u0027Here\u0027s a smart lad for you!\u0027 cried the Captain eyeing him sternly, \u0027as don\u0027t know his own native alphabet! Go away a bit and come back again alternate - d\u0027ye understand that?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Captain,\u0027 said Rob. \u0027Very good my lad, then,\u0027 said the Captain, relenting. \u0027Do it!\u0027 That he might do it the better, Captain Cuttle sometimes condescended, of an evening after the shop was shut, to rehearse this scene: retiring into the parlour for the purpose, as into the lodgings of a supposititious MacStinger, and carefully observing the behaviour of his ally, from the hole of espial he had cut in the wall. Rob the Grinder discharged himself of his duty with so much exactness and judgment, when thus put to the proof, that the Captain presented him, at divers times, with seven sixpences, in token of satisfaction; and gradually felt stealing over his spirit the resignation of a man who had made provision for the worst, and taken every reasonable precaution against an unrelenting fate. Nevertheless, the Captain did not tempt ill-fortune, by being a whit more venturesome than before. Though he considered it a point of good breeding in himself, as a general friend of the family, to attend Mr Dombey\u0027s wedding (of which he had heard from Mr Perch), and to show that gentleman a pleasant and approving countenance from the gallery, he had repaired to the church in a hackney cabriolet with both windows up; and might have scrupled even to make that venture, in his dread of Mrs MacStinger, but that the lady\u0027s attendance on the ministry of the Reverend Melchisedech rendered it peculiarly unlikely that she would be found in communion with the Establishment. The Captain got safe home again, and fell into the ordinary routine of his new life, without encountering any more direct alarm from the enemy, than was suggested to him by the daily bonnets in the street. But other subjects began to lay heavy on the Captain\u0027s mind. Walter\u0027s ship was still unheard of. No news came of old Sol Gills. Florence did not even know of the old man\u0027s disappearance, and Captain Cuttle had not the heart to tell her. Indeed the Captain, as his own hopes of the generous, handsome, gallant-hearted youth, whom he had loved, according to his rough manner, from a child, began to fade, and faded more and more from day to day, shrunk with instinctive pain from the thought of exchanging a word with Florence. If he had had good news to carry to her, the honest Captain would have braved the newly decorated house and splendid furniture - though these, connected with the lady he had seen at church, were awful to him - and made his way into her presence. With a dark horizon gathering around their common hopes, however, that darkened every hour, the Captain almost felt as if he were a new misfortune and affliction to her; and was scarcely less afraid of a visit from Florence, than from Mrs MacStinger herself. It was a chill dark autumn evening, and Captain Cuttle had ordered a fire to be kindled in the little back parlour, now more than ever like the cabin of a ship. The rain fell fast, and the wind blew hard; and straying out on the house-top by that stormy bedroom of his old friend, to take an observation of the weather, the Captain\u0027s heart died within him, when he saw how wild and desolate it was. Not that he associated the weather of that time with poor Walter\u0027s destiny, or doubted that if Providence had doomed him to be lost and shipwrecked, it was over, long ago; but that beneath an outward influence, quite distinct from the subject-matter of his thoughts, the Captain\u0027s spirits sank, and his hopes turned pale, as those of wiser men had often done before him, and will often do again. Captain Cuttle, addressing his face to the sharp wind and slanting rain, looked up at the heavy scud that was flying fast over the wilderness of house-tops, and looked for something cheery there in vain. The prospect near at hand was no better. In sundry tea-chests and other rough boxes at his feet, the pigeons of Rob the Grinder were cooing like so many dismal breezes getting up. A crazy weathercock of a midshipman, with a telescope at his eye, once visible from the street, but long bricked out, creaked and complained upon his rusty pivot as the shrill blast spun him round and round, and sported with him cruelly. Upon the Captain\u0027s coarse blue vest the cold raindrops started like steel beads; and he could hardly maintain himself aslant against the stiff Nor\u0027-Wester that came pressing against him, importunate to topple him over the parapet, and throw him on the pavement below. If there were any Hope alive that evening, the Captain thought, as he held his hat on, it certainly kept house, and wasn\u0027t out of doors; so the Captain, shaking his head in a despondent manner, went in to look for it. Captain Cuttle descended slowly to the little back parlour, and, seated in his accustomed chair, looked for it in the fire; but it was not there, though the fire was bright. He took out his tobacco-box and pipe, and composing himself to smoke, looked for it in the red glow from the bowl, and in the wreaths of vapour that curled upward from his lips; but there was not so much as an atom of the rust of Hope\u0027s anchor in either. He tried a glass of grog; but melancholy truth was at the bottom of that well, and he couldn\u0027t finish it. He made a turn or two in the shop, and looked for Hope among the instruments; but they obstinately worked out reckonings for the missing ship, in spite of any opposition he could offer, that ended at the bottom of the lone sea. The wind still rushing, and the rain still pattering, against the closed shutters, the Captain brought to before the wooden Midshipman upon the counter, and thought, as he dried the little officer\u0027s uniform with his sleeve, how many years the Midshipman had seen, during which few changes - hardly any - had transpired among his ship\u0027s company; how the changes had come all together, one day, as it might be; and of what a sweeping kind they web Here was the little society of the back parlour broken up, and scattered far and wide. Here was no audience for Lovely Peg, even if there had been anybody to sing it, which there was not; for the Captain was as morally certain that nobody but he could execute that ballad, he was that he had not the spirit, under existing circumstances, to attempt it. There was no bright face of \u0027Wal\u0027r\u0027 In the house; - here the Captain transferred his sleeve for a moment from the Midshipman\u0027s uniform to his own cheek; - the familiar wig and buttons of Sol Gills were a vision of the past; Richard Whittington was knocked on the head; and every plan and project in connexion with the Midshipman, lay drifting, without mast or rudder, on the waste of waters. As the Captain, with a dejected face, stood revolving these thoughts, and polishing the Midshipman, partly in the tenderness of old acquaintance, and partly in the absence of his mind, a knocking at the shop-door communicated a frightful start to the frame of Rob the Grinder, seated on the counter, whose large eyes had been intently fixed on the Captain\u0027s face, and who had been debating within himself, for the five hundredth time, whether the Captain could have done a murder, that he had such an evil conscience, and was always running away. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 said Captain Cuttle, softly. \u0027Somebody\u0027s knuckles, Captain,\u0027 answered Rob the Grinder. The Captain, with an abashed and guilty air, immediately walked on tiptoe to the little parlour and locked himself in. Rob, opening the door, would have parleyed with the visitor on the threshold if the visitor had come in female guise; but the figure being of the male sex, and Rob\u0027s orders only applying to women, Rob held the door open and allowed it to enter: which it did very quickly, glad to get out of the driving rain. \u0027A job for Burgess and Co. at any rate,\u0027 said the visitor, looking over his shoulder compassionately at his own legs, which were very wet and covered with splashes. \u0027Oh, how-de-do, Mr Gills?\u0027 The salutation was addressed to the Captain, now emerging from the back parlour with a most transparent and utterly futile affectation of coming out by accidence. \u0027Thankee,\u0027 the gentleman went on to say in the same breath; \u0027I\u0027m very well indeed, myself, I\u0027m much obliged to you. My name is Toots, - Mister Toots.\u0027 The Captain remembered to have seen this young gentleman at the wedding, and made him a bow. Mr Toots replied with a chuckle; and being embarrassed, as he generally was, breathed hard, shook hands with the Captain for a long time, and then falling on Rob the Grinder, in the absence of any other resource, shook hands with him in a most affectionate and cordial manner. \u0027I say! I should like to speak a word to you, Mr Gills, if you please,\u0027 said Toots at length, with surprising presence of mind. \u0027I say! Miss D.O.M. you know!\u0027 The Captain, with responsive gravity and mystery, immediately waved his hook towards the little parlour, whither Mr Toots followed him. \u0027Oh! I beg your pardon though,\u0027 said Mr Toots, looking up In the Captain\u0027s face as he sat down in a chair by the fire, which the Captain placed for him; \u0027you don\u0027t happen to know the Chicken at all; do you, Mr Gills?\u0027 \u0027The Chicken?\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027The Game Chicken,\u0027 said Mr Toots. The Captain shaking his head, Mr Toots explained that the man alluded to was the celebrated public character who had covered himself and his country with glory in his contest with the Nobby Shropshire One; but this piece of information did not appear to enlighten the Captain very much. \u0027Because he\u0027s outside: that\u0027s all,\u0027 said Mr Toots. \u0027But it\u0027s of no consequence; he won\u0027t get very wet, perhaps.\u0027 \u0027I can pass the word for him in a moment,\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027Well, if you would have the goodness to let him sit in the shop with your young man,\u0027 chuckled Mr Toots, \u0027I should be glad; because, you know, he\u0027s easily offended, and the damp\u0027s rather bad for his stamina. I\u0027ll call him in, Mr Gills.\u0027 With that, Mr Toots repairing to the shop-door, sent a peculiar whistle into the night, which produced a stoical gentleman in a shaggy white great-coat and a flat-brimmed hat, with very short hair, a broken nose, and a considerable tract of bare and sterile country behind each ear. \u0027Sit down, Chicken,\u0027 said Mr Toots. The compliant Chicken spat out some small pieces of straw on which he was regaling himself, and took in a fresh supply from a reserve he carried in his hand. \u0027There ain\u0027t no drain of nothing short handy, is there?\u0027 said the Chicken, generally. \u0027This here sluicing night is hard lines to a man as lives on his condition. Captain Cuttle proffered a glass of rum, which the Chicken, throwing back his head, emptied into himself, as into a cask, after proposing the brief sentiment, \u0027Towards us!\u0027 Mr Toots and the Captain returning then to the parlour, and taking their seats before the fire, Mr Toots began: \u0027Mr Gills - \u0027 \u0027Awast!\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027My name\u0027s Cuttle.\u0027 Mr Toots looked greatly disconcerted, while the Captain proceeded gravely. \u0027Cap\u0027en Cuttle is my name, and England is my nation, this here is my dwelling-place, and blessed be creation - Job,\u0027 said the Captain, as an index to his authority. \u0027Oh! I couldn\u0027t see Mr Gills, could I?\u0027 said Mr Toots; \u0027because - \u0027 \u0027If you could see Sol Gills, young gen\u0027l\u0027m\u0027n,\u0027 said the Captain, impressively, and laying his heavy hand on Mr Toots\u0027s knee, \u0027old Sol, mind you - with your own eyes - as you sit there - you\u0027d be welcomer to me, than a wind astern, to a ship becalmed. But you can\u0027t see Sol Gills. And why can\u0027t you see Sol Gills?\u0027 said the Captain, apprised by the face of Mr Toots that he was making a profound impression on that gentleman\u0027s mind. \u0027Because he\u0027s inwisible.\u0027 Mr Toots in his agitation was going to reply that it was of no consequence at all. But he corrected himself, and said, \u0027Lor bless me!\u0027 \u0027That there man,\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027has left me in charge here by a piece of writing, but though he was a\u0027most as good as my sworn brother, I know no more where he\u0027s gone, or why he\u0027s gone; if so be to seek his nevy, or if so be along of being not quite settled in his mind; than you do. One morning at daybreak, he went over the side,\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027without a splash, without a ripple I have looked for that man high and low, and never set eyes, nor ears, nor nothing else, upon him from that hour.\u0027 \u0027But, good Gracious, Miss Dombey don\u0027t know - \u0027 Mr Toots began. \u0027Why, I ask you, as a feeling heart,\u0027 said the Captain, dropping his voice, \u0027why should she know? why should she be made to know, until such time as there wam\u0027t any help for it? She took to old Sol Gills, did that sweet creetur, with a kindness, with a affability, with a - what\u0027s the good of saying so? you know her.\u0027 \u0027I should hope so,\u0027 chuckled Mr Toots, with a conscious blush that suffused his whole countenance. \u0027And you come here from her?\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027I should think so,\u0027 chuckled Mr Toots. \u0027Then all I need observe, is,\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027that you know a angel, and are chartered a angel.\u0027 Mr Toots instantly seized the Captain\u0027s hand, and requested the favour of his friendship. \u0027Upon my word and honour,\u0027 said Mr Toots, earnestly, \u0027I should be very much obliged to you if you\u0027d improve my acquaintance I should like to know you, Captain, very much. I really am In want of a friend, I am. Little Dombey was my friend at old Blimber\u0027s, and would have been now, if he\u0027d have lived. The Chicken,\u0027 said Mr Toots, in a forlorn whisper, \u0027is very well - admirable in his way - the sharpest man perhaps in the world; there\u0027s not a move he isn\u0027t up to, everybody says so - but I don\u0027t know - he\u0027s not everything. So she is an angel, Captain. If there is an angel anywhere, it\u0027s Miss Dombey. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve always said. Really though, you know,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027I should be very much obliged to you if you\u0027d cultivate my acquaintance.\u0027 Captain Cuttle received this proposal in a polite manner, but still without committing himself to its acceptance; merely observing, \u0027Ay, ay, my lad. We shall see, we shall see;\u0027 and reminding Mr Toots of his immediate mission, by inquiring to what he was indebted for the honour of that visit. \u0027Why the fact is,\u0027 replied Mr Toots, \u0027that it\u0027s the young woman I come from. Not Miss Dombey - Susan, you know. The Captain nodded his head once, with a grave expression of face indicative of his regarding that young woman with serious respect. \u0027And I\u0027ll tell you how it happens,\u0027 said Mr Toots. \u0027You know, I go and call sometimes, on Miss Dombey. I don\u0027t go there on purpose, you know, but I happen to be in the neighbourhood very often; and when I find myself there, why - why I call.\u0027 \u0027Nat\u0027rally,\u0027 observed the Captain. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Mr Toots. \u0027I called this afternoon. Upon my word and honour, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to form an idea of the angel Miss Dombey was this afternoon.\u0027 The Captain answered with a jerk of his head, implying that it might not be easy to some people, but was quite so to him. \u0027As I was coming out,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027the young woman, in the most unexpected manner, took me into the pantry. The Captain seemed, for the moment, to object to this proceeding; and leaning back in his chair, looked at Mr Toots with a distrustful, if not threatening visage. \u0027Where she brought out,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027this newspaper. She told me that she had kept it from Miss Dombey all day, on account of something that was in it, about somebody that she and Dombey used to know; and then she read the passage to me. Very well. Then she said - wait a minute; what was it she said, though!\u0027 Mr Toots, endeavouring to concentrate his mental powers on this question, unintentionally fixed the Captain\u0027s eye, and was so much discomposed by its stern expression, that his difficulty in resuming the thread of his subject was enhanced to a painful extent. \u0027Oh!\u0027 said Mr Toots after long consideration. \u0027Oh, ah! Yes! She said that she hoped there was a bare possibility that it mightn\u0027t be true; and that as she couldn\u0027t very well come out herself, without surprising Miss Dombey, would I go down to Mr Solomon Gills the Instrument-maker\u0027s in this street, who was the party\u0027s Uncle, and ask whether he believed it was true, or had heard anything else in the City. She said, if he couldn\u0027t speak to me, no doubt Captain Cuttle could. By the bye!\u0027 said Mr Toots, as the discovery flashed upon him, \u0027you, you know!\u0027 The Captain glanced at the newspaper in Mr Toots\u0027s hand, and breathed short and hurriedly. \u0027Well, pursued Mr Toots, \u0027the reason why I\u0027m rather late is, because I went up as far as Finchley first, to get some uncommonly fine chickweed that grows there, for Miss Dombey\u0027s bird. But I came on here, directly afterwards. You\u0027ve seen the paper, I suppose?\u0027 The Captain, who had become cautious of reading the news, lest he should find himself advertised at full length by Mrs MacStinger, shook his head. \u0027Shall I read the passage to you?\u0027 inquired Mr Toots. The Captain making a sign in the affirmative, Mr Toots read as follows, from the Shipping Intelligence: \u0027\"Southampton. The barque Defiance, Henry James, Commander, arrived in this port to-day, with a cargo of sugar, coffee, and rum, reports that being becalmed on the sixth day of her passage home from Jamaica, in\" - in such and such a latitude, you know,\u0027 said Mr Toots, after making a feeble dash at the figures, and tumbling over them. \u0027Ay!\u0027 cried the Captain, striking his clenched hand on the table. \u0027Heave ahead, my lad!\u0027 \u0027 - latitude,\u0027 repeated Mr Toots, with a startled glance at the Captain, \u0027and longitude so-and-so, - \"the look-out observed, half an hour before sunset, some fragments of a wreck, drifting at about the distance of a mile. The weather being clear, and the barque making no way, a boat was hoisted out, with orders to inspect the same, when they were found to consist of sundry large spars, and a part of the main rigging of an English brig, of about five hundred tons burden, together with a portion of the stem on which the words and letters \u0027Son and H-\u0027 were yet plainly legible. No vestige of any dead body was to be seen upon the floating fragments. Log of the Defiance states, that a breeze springing up in the night, the wreck was seen no more. There can be no doubt that all surmises as to the fate of the missing vessel, the Son and Heir, port of London, bound for Barbados, are now set at rest for ever; that she broke up in the last hurricane; and that every soul on board perished.\"\u0027 Captain Cuttle, like all mankind, little knew how much hope had survived within him under discouragement, until he felt its death-shock. During the reading of the paragraph, and for a minute or two afterwards, he sat with his gaze fixed on the modest Mr Toots, like a man entranced; then, suddenly rising, and putting on his glazed hat, which, in his visitor\u0027s honour, he had laid upon the table, the Captain turned his back, and bent his head down on the little chimneypiece. \u0027Oh\u0027 upon my word and honour,\u0027 cried Mr Toots, whose tender heart was moved by the Captain\u0027s unexpected distress, \u0027this is a most wretched sort of affair this world is! Somebody\u0027s always dying, or going and doing something uncomfortable in it. I\u0027m sure I never should have looked forward so much, to coming into my property, if I had known this. I never saw such a world. It\u0027s a great deal worse than Blimber\u0027s.\u0027 Captain Cuttle, without altering his position, signed to Mr Toots not to mind him; and presently turned round, with his glazed hat thrust back upon his ears, and his hand composing and smoothing his brown face. \u0027Wal\u0027r, my dear lad,\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027farewell! Wal\u0027r my child, my boy, and man, I loved you! He warn\u0027t my flesh and blood,\u0027 said the Captain, looking at the fire - \u0027I ain\u0027t got none - but something of what a father feels when he loses a son, I feel in losing Wal\u0027r. For why?\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027Because it ain\u0027t one loss, but a round dozen. Where\u0027s that there young school-boy with the rosy face and curly hair, that used to be as merry in this here parlour, come round every week, as a piece of music? Gone down with Wal\u0027r. Where\u0027s that there fresh lad, that nothing couldn\u0027t tire nor put out, and that sparkled up and blushed so, when we joked him about Heart\u0027s Delight, that he was beautiful to look at? Gone down with Wal\u0027r. Where\u0027s that there man\u0027s spirit, all afire, that wouldn\u0027t see the old man hove down for a minute, and cared nothing for itself? Gone down with Wal\u0027r. It ain\u0027t one Wal\u0027r. There was a dozen Wal\u0027rs that I know\u0027d and loved, all holding round his neck when he went down, and they\u0027re a-holding round mine now!\u0027 Mr Toots sat silent: folding and refolding the newspaper as small as possible upon his knee. \u0027And Sol Gills,\u0027 said the Captain, gazing at the fire, \u0027poor nevyless old Sol, where are you got to! you was left in charge of me; his last words was, \"Take care of my Uncle!\" What came over you, Sol, when you went and gave the go-bye to Ned Cuttle; and what am I to put In my accounts that he\u0027s a looking down upon, respecting you! Sol Gills, Sol Gills!\u0027 said the Captain, shaking his head slowly, \u0027catch sight of that there newspaper, away from home, with no one as know\u0027d Wal\u0027r by, to say a word; and broadside to you broach, and down you pitch, head foremost!\u0027 Drawing a heavy sigh, the Captain turned to Mr Toots, and roused himself to a sustained consciousness of that gentleman\u0027s presence. \u0027My lad,\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027you must tell the young woman honestly that this here fatal news is too correct. They don\u0027t romance, you see, on such pints. It\u0027s entered on the ship\u0027s log, and that\u0027s the truest book as a man can write. To-morrow morning,\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027I\u0027ll step out and make inquiries; but they\u0027ll lead to no good. They can\u0027t do it. If you\u0027ll give me a look-in in the forenoon, you shall know what I have heerd; but tell the young woman from Cap\u0027en Cuttle, that it\u0027s over. Over!\u0027 And the Captain, hooking off his glazed hat, pulled his handkerchief out of the crown, wiped his grizzled head despairingly, and tossed the handkerchief in again, with the indifference of deep dejection. \u0027Oh! I assure you,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027really I am dreadfully sorry. Upon my word I am, though I wasn\u0027t acquainted with the party. Do you think Miss Dombey will be very much affected, Captain Gills - I mean Mr Cuttle?\u0027 \u0027Why, Lord love you,\u0027 returned the Captain, with something of compassion for Mr Toots\u0027s innocence. When she warn\u0027t no higher than that, they were as fond of one another as two young doves.\u0027 \u0027Were they though!\u0027 said Mr Toots, with a considerably lengthened face. \u0027They were made for one another,\u0027 said the Captain, mournfully; \u0027but what signifies that now!\u0027 \u0027Upon my word and honour,\u0027 cried Mr Toots, blurting out his words through a singular combination of awkward chuckles and emotion, \u0027I\u0027m even more sorry than I was before. You know, Captain Gills, I - I positively adore Miss Dombey; - I - I am perfectly sore with loving her;\u0027 the burst with which this confession forced itself out of the unhappy Mr Toots, bespoke the vehemence of his feelings; \u0027but what would be the good of my regarding her in this manner, if I wasn\u0027t truly sorry for her feeling pain, whatever was the cause of it. Mine ain\u0027t a selfish affection, you know,\u0027 said Mr Toots, in the confidence engendered by his having been a witness of the Captain\u0027s tenderness. \u0027It\u0027s the sort of thing with me, Captain Gills, that if I could be run over - or - or trampled upon - or - or thrown off a very high place -or anything of that sort - for Miss Dombey\u0027s sake, it would be the most delightful thing that could happen to me. All this, Mr Toots said in a suppressed voice, to prevent its reaching the jealous ears of the Chicken, who objected to the softer emotions; which effort of restraint, coupled with the intensity of his feelings, made him red to the tips of his ears, and caused him to present such an affecting spectacle of disinterested love to the eyes of Captain Cuttle, that the good Captain patted him consolingly on the back, and bade him cheer up. \u0027Thankee, Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027it\u0027s kind of you, in the midst of your own troubles, to say so. I\u0027m very much obliged to you. As I said before, I really want a friend, and should be glad to have your acquaintance. Although I am very well off,\u0027 said Mr Toots, with energy, \u0027you can\u0027t think what a miserable Beast I am. The hollow crowd, you know, when they see me with the Chicken, and characters of distinction like that, suppose me to be happy; but I\u0027m wretched. I suffer for Miss Dombey, Captain Gills. I can\u0027t get through my meals; I have no pleasure in my tailor; I often cry when I\u0027m alone. I assure you it\u0027ll be a satisfaction to me to come back to-morrow, or to come back fifty times.\u0027 Mr Toots, with these words, shook the Captain\u0027s hand; and disguising such traces of his agitation as could be disguised on so short a notice, before the Chicken\u0027s penetrating glance, rejoined that eminent gentleman in the shop. The Chicken, who was apt to be jealous of his ascendancy, eyed Captain Cuttle with anything but favour as he took leave of Mr Toots, but followed his patron without being otherwise demonstrative of his ill-will: leaving the Captain oppressed with sorrow; and Rob the Grinder elevated with joy, on account of having had the honour of staring for nearly half an hour at the conqueror of the Nobby Shropshire One. Long after Rob was fast asleep in his bed under the counter, the Captain sat looking at the fire; and long after there was no fire to look at, the Captain sat gazing on the rusty bars, with unavailing thoughts of Walter and old Sol crowding through his mind. Retirement to the stormy chamber at the top of the house brought no rest with it; and the Captain rose up in the morning, sorrowful and unrefreshed. As soon as the City offices were opened, the Captain issued forth to the counting-house of Dombey and Son. But there was no opening of the Midshipman\u0027s windows that morning. Rob the Grinder, by the Captain\u0027s orders, left the shutters closed, and the house was as a house of death. It chanced that Mr Carker was entering the office, as Captain Cuttle arrived at the door. Receiving the Manager\u0027s benison gravely and silently, Captain Cuttle made bold to accompany him into his own room. \u0027Well, Captain Cuttle,\u0027 said Mr Carker, taking up his usual position before the fireplace, and keeping on his hat, \u0027this is a bad business.\u0027 \u0027You have received the news as was in print yesterday, Sir?\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Mr Carker, \u0027we have received it! It was accurately stated. The underwriters suffer a considerable loss. We are very sorry. No help! Such is life!\u0027 Mr Carker pared his nails delicately with a penknife, and smiled at the Captain, who was standing by the door looking at him. \u0027I excessively regret poor Gay,\u0027 said Carker, \u0027and the crew. I understand there were some of our very best men among \u0027em. It always happens so. Many men with families too. A comfort to reflect that poor Gay had no family, Captain Cuttle!\u0027 The Captain stood rubbing his chin, and looking at the Manager. The Manager glanced at the unopened letters lying on his desk, and took up the newspaper. \u0027Is there anything I can do for you, Captain Cuttle?\u0027 he asked looking off it, with a smiling and expressive glance at the door. \u0027I wish you could set my mind at rest, Sir, on something it\u0027s uneasy about,\u0027 returned the Captain. \u0027Ay!\u0027 exclaimed the Manager, \u0027what\u0027s that? Come, Captain Cuttle, I must trouble you to be quick, if you please. I am much engaged.\u0027 \u0027Lookee here, Sir,\u0027 said the Captain, advancing a step. \u0027Afore my friend Wal\u0027r went on this here disastrous voyage - \u0027Come, come, Captain Cuttle,\u0027 interposed the smiling Manager, \u0027don\u0027t talk about disastrous voyages in that way. We have nothing to do with disastrous voyages here, my good fellow. You must have begun very early on your day\u0027s allowance, Captain, if you don\u0027t remember that there are hazards in all voyages, whether by sea or land. You are not made uneasy by the supposition that young what\u0027s-his-name was lost in bad weather that was got up against him in these offices - are you? Fie, Captain! Sleep, and soda-water, are the best cures for such uneasiness as that. \u0027My lad,\u0027 returned the Captain, slowly - \u0027you are a\u0027most a lad to me, and so I don\u0027t ask your pardon for that slip of a word, - if you find any pleasure in this here sport, you ain\u0027t the gentleman I took you for. And if you ain\u0027t the gentleman I took you for, may be my mind has call to be uneasy. Now this is what it is, Mr Carker. - Afore that poor lad went away, according to orders, he told me that he warn\u0027t a going away for his own good, or for promotion, he know\u0027d. It was my belief that he was wrong, and I told him so, and I come here, your head governor being absent, to ask a question or two of you in a civil way, for my own satisfaction. Them questions you answered - free. Now it\u0027ll ease my mind to know, when all is over, as it is, and when what can\u0027t be cured must be endoored - for which, as a scholar, you\u0027ll overhaul the book it\u0027s in, and thereof make a note - to know once more, in a word, that I warn\u0027t mistaken; that I warn\u0027t back\u0027ard in my duty when I didn\u0027t tell the old man what Wal\u0027r told me; and that the wind was truly in his sail, when he highsted of it for Barbados Harbour. Mr Carker,\u0027 said the Captain, in the goodness of his nature, \u0027when I was here last, we was very pleasant together. If I ain\u0027t been altogether so pleasant myself this morning, on account of this poor lad, and if I have chafed again any observation of yours that I might have fended off, my name is Ed\u0027ard Cuttle, and I ask your pardon.\u0027 \u0027Captain Cuttle,\u0027 returned the Manager, with all possible politeness, \u0027I must ask you to do me a favour.\u0027 \u0027And what is it, Sir?\u0027 inquired the Captain. \u0027To have the goodness to walk off, if you please,\u0027 rejoined the Manager, stretching forth his arm, \u0027and to carry your jargon somewhere else.\u0027 Every knob in the Captain\u0027s face turned white with astonishment and indignation; even the red rim on his forehead faded, like a rainbow among the gathering clouds. \u0027I tell you what, Captain Cuttle,\u0027 said the Manager, shaking his forefinger at him, and showing him all his teeth, but still amiably smiling, \u0027I was much too lenient with you when you came here before. You belong to an artful and audacious set of people. In my desire to save young what\u0027s-his-name from being kicked out of this place, neck and crop, my good Captain, I tolerated you; but for once, and only once. Now, go, my friend!\u0027 The Captain was absolutely rooted to the ground, and speechless - \u0027Go,\u0027 said the good-humoured Manager, gathering up his skirts, and standing astride upon the hearth-rug, \u0027like a sensible fellow, and let us have no turning out, or any such violent measures. If Mr Dombey were here, Captain, you might be obliged to leave in a more ignominious manner, possibly. I merely say, Go!\u0027 The Captain, laying his ponderous hand upon his chest, to assist himself in fetching a deep breath, looked at Mr Carker from head to foot, and looked round the little room, as if he did not clearly understand where he was, or in what company. \u0027You are deep, Captain Cuttle,\u0027 pursued Carker, with the easy and vivacious frankness of a man of the world who knew the world too well to be ruffled by any discovery of misdoing, when it did not immediately concern himself, \u0027but you are not quite out of soundings, either - neither you nor your absent friend, Captain. What have you done with your absent friend, hey?\u0027 Again the Captain laid his hand upon his chest. After drawing another deep breath, he conjured himself to \u0027stand by!\u0027 But In a whisper. \u0027You hatch nice little plots, and hold nice little councils, and make nice little appointments, and receive nice little visitors, too, Captain, hey?\u0027 said Carker, bending his brows upon him, without showing his teeth any the less: \u0027but it\u0027s a bold measure to come here afterwards. Not like your discretion! You conspirators, and hiders, and runners-away, should know better than that. Will you oblige me by going?\u0027 \u0027My lad,\u0027 gasped the Captain, in a choked and trembling voice, and with a curious action going on in the ponderous fist; \u0027there\u0027s a many words I could wish to say to you, but I don\u0027t rightly know where they\u0027re stowed just at present. My young friend, Wal\u0027r, was drownded only last night, according to my reckoning, and it puts me out, you see. But you and me will come alongside o\u0027one another again, my lad,\u0027 said the Captain, holding up his hook, if we live.\u0027 \u0027It will be anything but shrewd in you, my good fellow, if we do,\u0027 returned the Manager, with the same frankness; \u0027for you may rely, I give you fair warning, upon my detecting and exposing you. I don\u0027t pretend to be a more moral man than my neighbours, my good Captain; but the confidence of this House, or of any member of this House, is not to be abused and undermined while I have eyes and ears. Good day!\u0027 said Mr Carker, nodding his head. Captain Cuttle, looking at him steadily (Mr Carker looked full as steadily at the Captain), went out of the office and left him standing astride before the fire, as calm and pleasant as if there were no more spots upon his soul than on his pure white linen, and his smooth sleek skin. The Captain glanced, in passing through the outer counting-house, at the desk where he knew poor Walter had been used to sit, now occupied by another young boy, with a face almost as fresh and hopeful as his on the day when they tapped the famous last bottle but one of the old Madeira, in the little back parlour. The nation of ideas, thus awakened, did the Captain a great deal of good; it softened him in the very height of his anger, and brought the tears into his eyes. Arrived at the wooden Midshipman\u0027s again, and sitting down in a corner of the dark shop, the Captain\u0027s indignation, strong as it was, could make no head against his grief. Passion seemed not only to do wrong and violence to the memory of the dead, but to be infected by death, and to droop and decline beside it. All the living knaves and liars in the world, were nothing to the honesty and truth of one dead friend. The only thing the honest Captain made out clearly, in this state of mind, besides the loss of Walter, was, that with him almost the whole world of Captain Cuttle had been drowned. If he reproached himself sometimes, and keenly too, for having ever connived at Walter\u0027s innocent deceit, he thought at least as often of the Mr Carker whom no sea could ever render up; and the Mr Dombey, whom he now began to perceive was as far beyond human recall; and the \u0027Heart\u0027s Delight,\u0027 with whom he must never foregather again; and the Lovely Peg, that teak-built and trim ballad, that had gone ashore upon a rock, and split into mere planks and beams of rhyme. The Captain sat in the dark shop, thinking of these things, to the entire exclusion of his own injury; and looking with as sad an eye upon the ground, as if in contemplation of their actual fragments, as they floated past But the Captain was not unmindful, for all that, of such decent and rest observances in memory of poor Walter, as he felt within his power. Rousing himself, and rousing Rob the Grinder (who in the unnatural twilight was fast asleep), the Captain sallied forth with his attendant at his heels, and the door-key in his pocket, and repairing to one of those convenient slop-selling establishments of which there is abundant choice at the eastern end of London, purchased on the spot two suits of mourning - one for Rob the Grinder, which was immensely too small, and one for himself, which was immensely too large. He also provided Rob with a species of hat, greatly to be admired for its symmetry and usefulness, as well as for a happy blending of the mariner with the coal-heaver; which is usually termed a sou\u0027wester; and which was something of a novelty in connexion with the instrument business. In their several garments, which the vendor declared to be such a miracle in point of fit as nothing but a rare combination of fortuitous circumstances ever brought about, and the fashion of which was unparalleled within the memory of the oldest inhabitant, the Captain and Grinder immediately arrayed themselves: presenting a spectacle fraught with wonder to all who beheld it. In this altered form, the Captain received Mr Toots. \u0027I\u0027m took aback, my lad, at present,\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027and will only confirm that there ill news. Tell the young woman to break it gentle to the young lady, and for neither of \u0027em never to think of me no more - \u0027special, mind you, that is - though I will think of them, when night comes on a hurricane and seas is mountains rowling, for which overhaul your Doctor Watts, brother, and when found make a note on.\" The Captain reserved, until some fitter time, the consideration of Mr Toots\u0027s offer of friendship, and thus dismissed him. Captain Cuttle\u0027s spirits were so low, in truth, that he half determined, that day, to take no further precautions against surprise from Mrs MacStinger, but to abandon himself recklessly to chance, and be indifferent to what might happen. As evening came on, he fell into a better frame of mind, however; and spoke much of Walter to Rob the Grinder, whose attention and fidelity he likewise incidentally commended. Rob did not blush to hear the Captain earnest in his praises, but sat staring at him, and affecting to snivel with sympathy, and making a feint of being virtuous, and treasuring up every word he said (like a young spy as he was) with very promising deceit. When Rob had turned in, and was fast asleep, the Captain trimmed the candle, put on his spectacles - he had felt it appropriate to take to spectacles on entering into the Instrument Trade, though his eyes were like a hawk\u0027s - and opened the prayer-book at the Burial Service. And reading softly to himself, in the little back parlour, and stopping now and then to wipe his eyes, the Captain, In a true and simple spirit, committed Walter\u0027s body to the deep. 诚实的卡特尔船长在他的设置了防御工事的避难所中度过了好几个星期之后，决不因为敌人没有出现就撤销他为防止突然袭击而采取的谨慎措施。船长认为，他目前这种过分高度的安全，这种过分奇妙的安全是难于持续很久的；他知道，当吹顺风的时候，风标不会长久在那里固定不动；他对麦克斯廷杰太太那毅然决然、毫不畏缩的性格十分熟悉，所以毫不怀疑，这位英勇的女人已打定主意，千方百计要把他寻找出来和逮捕回去。在这些顾虑的重压下，船长战战兢兢地过着十分闭塞和与世隔绝的生活，天黑以前很少出外活动，甚至在天黑以后也只敢冒险到最偏僻的街道上去走走；一到星期天，他就寸步也不离屋子；不论是在他避难所的墙内还是墙外，他都避开女帽，仿佛它们是由狂怒的狮子戴着的。 船长从没有梦想过：当他出去散步时，麦克斯廷杰太太猛扑过来把他抓住的时候，他可能进行抵抗。他觉得不能那样做。他在想象中已看到自己顺服地被安置在出租马车里，运送到他原先的住所中。他预见到，他一旦被禁闭在那里，他就会成为一个毫无希望的人，他的帽子也就会被取走了；麦克斯廷杰太太将日夜监视着他；当着小孩子们的面，各种谴责都将纷纷落到他的头上；他本人将成为一个被怀疑和不受信任的有罪的对象；在孩子们的心目中他是个吃人的魔鬼；在他们母亲的心目中他将是个被查获的叛变者。 当这幅凄惨的景象在他的幻想中出现的时候，船长常常汗流浃背，情绪消沉。当他夜里悄悄离开屋子出去呼吸新鲜空气和活动活动之前，通常发生这种情形。船长明白他所冒的危险，所以在这种时候总是像一个可能永远不再回来的人那样一本正经地向罗布告别，劝告他，万一他（船长）在一段时间中不见了，他就规规矩矩地做人，把铜制的仪器好好擦亮。 但是卡特尔船长不愿放弃任何得救的机会，并为了在最坏的情况下保证能和外界保持联系，不久就想出了一个巧妙的主意，就是教给磨工罗布一些信号，这样在遭遇不幸时，这位追随者就可以发出信号，使他的司令知道他已前来效忠。船长经过反复思考后，决定教他吹“啊，兴高采烈地、兴高采烈地！”这支海上歌曲的口哨。磨工罗布把口哨吹得十分熟练，一个住在陆地上的人最多也只能指望达到那样完美的程度了，这时船长就向他发出以下神秘的指示，让他记在心上： “唔，我的孩子，做好准备！如果我什么时候被抓去的话——” “被抓去，船长！”罗布圆眼睛睁得大大的，打断他说道。 “是的！”船长阴郁地说道，“如果我什么时候出去，本打算回来吃晚饭的，但后来却没有出现在你近旁的话，那么，在发现我丢失之后二十四个钟头之后，你就跑到布里格广场，在我过去停泊的地方附近吹这支曲子；不过，你要知道，你得别让人听出你有什么意图，而要装出仿佛你是偶尔漂流到那里去的。如果我也用这支曲子回答你，那么你就掉转船头离开，我的孩子，过二十四个钟头再回来；如果我用另一支曲子回答你，你就一会儿驶离海岸，一会儿靠近海岸，等待我给你新的信号为止。这些命令你听明白了没有？” “我一会儿驶离海岸，一会儿靠近海岸，这指什么，船长？” 罗布问道，“是指马路吗？” “瞧你这机灵的孩子！”船长严厉地注视着他，喊道，“连本国话也听不懂！离开一会儿，然后又回来，这么轮流着。——现在懂了吗？” “懂了，船长，”罗布说道。 “很好，我的孩子，”船长态度温和下来，心平气和地说道，“那就这么办吧！” 为了使罗布做得更好，船长有时在晚上关上店门之后，放下架子，跟他演习起来；为了这个目的，他退藏到客厅里，那是假想中的麦克斯廷杰的住所；然后从他在墙上挖出的侦察洞中仔细地观察他的盟友的举动。磨工罗布十分准确和熟练地完成了他的任务；经过这样考验之后，船长表示满意，好几次送给他六便士的硬币，总共送了七枚，并暗暗地在心中逐渐产生了一种安宁的感觉，这是一个对最坏的情况作了准备，并为对付残酷命运采取了各种适当防备措施的人才能有的。 可是船长一点也不比过去鲁莽随便，去冒碰上厄运的风险。他从珀奇先生那里听到董贝先生将要结婚的消息之后，虽然认为，作为他们家里的朋友，他去参加董贝先生的婚礼，并从楼座向这位先生显露他高兴和赞成的脸孔，是他应该表示的礼貌，但是他乘坐出租单马篷车前去教堂的时候，两边的窗子都是关上的。本来他由于害怕麦克斯廷杰太太，甚至是不是要冒这次风险都是迟疑不决的，但因为那位太太要去参加梅尔奇斯代克大师主持的礼拜仪式，因此在他要去的那个教堂里极不可能也看到她。 船长又平安地回到家里，过着他的新的常规生活。除了每天街道上来往的女帽外，敌人没有在其他方面引起他惊慌。但是其他的问题开始沉重地压在船长的心头。沃尔特的船仍然杳无音讯。老所尔·吉尔斯也毫无消息。弗洛伦斯甚至还不知道老人已经失踪，卡特尔船长也没有心情去告诉她。那位豁达大度、外貌英俊、有侠义气概的青年，从他是个小孩子的时候起，船长就以他粗鲁的方式喜爱他；由于船长觉得他得救的希望开始一天天地愈来愈微弱，所以他一想起要跟弗洛伦斯交谈一两句话，都确实会由于本能地感到痛苦而畏缩起来。如果他有好消息带给她，诚实的船长将会大胆地走进那座装饰一新的公馆，穿过那些光彩夺目的家具，找到道路，走到她的面前去（虽然这些豪华的场面和他在教堂里看到的那位夫人使他感到心寒胆怯）。可是当乌云聚集在他们共同希望的上空，随着一小时一小时过去，愈聚愈浓的时候，船长几乎觉得仿佛他本人对她来说就是一个新的不幸与痛苦似的，所以他害怕弗洛伦斯前来访问，几乎就跟害怕麦克斯廷杰太太前来访问一样。 这是一个寒冷的、黑暗的秋天晚上，卡特尔船长嘱咐罗布在小后客厅里生火，这个小后客厅现在比任何时候都更像是一个船舱了。雨急速地下着，风猛烈地刮着。船长穿过他老朋友的敞开着被暴风吹刮着的卧室，登上屋顶去观察天气；当他看到天气是那么险恶、凄凉的时候，他心灰意冷了，这并不是说他把这时的天气跟可怜的沃尔特的命运联系起来，也不是说他还怀疑：如果老天爷注定他要遭到船沉人亡的命运的话，那么这也是好久以前就已过去的事了；而是说，在跟他思考的问题完全不同的外界的影响下，船长的情绪低沉了，他的希望暗淡了，就像那些比他更聪明的人也曾时常有过，今后也会时常再现的情形一样。 卡特尔船长的脸迎着凛冽的寒风和斜打过来的雨，仰望着从荒凉的屋顶上迅速飞过去的阴沉的雨云，徒劳无益地企图从中寻找出一点可以引起高兴的东西。周围的景物并不好一些。在他脚边各色各样的茶叶箱和其他粗陋的箱子中，磨工罗布的鸽子在咕咕地叫着，很像吹起微风时的凄惋的。有一位把望远镜放在眼睛前面的海军军官候补生，过去曾经一度可以从街道上看到他，但是却长期被砖墙遮挡住了；他是一个摇晃不稳的风向标，当强烈的疾风把他吹刮得团团旋转，并残酷地跟他闹着玩的时候，他在生锈的枢轴上抱怨诉苦，发出了吱吱嘎嘎的声音。寒冷的雨点像钢珠一样在船长的粗糙的蓝色背心上跳起来，猛烈的西北风紧紧吹刮着他的身子，他几乎歪歪斜斜地站不住脚跟；这狂风不肯罢休地袭击着他，想把他从栏杆上推翻下去，抛掷到下面的人行道上。船长抓住帽子，心想今晚如果还有保住性命的希望的话，那么这希望自然是在家里而不是在户外，因此，船长就垂头丧气地摇晃着脑袋，走进屋子去寻找这希望。 卡特尔船长慢吞吞地下了楼，走到后客厅里，坐在他平日的椅子中，开始在炉火中寻找希望；虽然炉火熊熊，明明亮亮，但是它不在那里。他取出烟草盒子和烟斗，安下心来抽烟，并从烟斗中烧红的烟火中和从他嘴中喷出的缭绕的烟雾中寻找它，可是那里连希望的一星半点的微粒也找不到。他倒了一杯搀水的烈酒试试，但是他不能喝干它，否则令人伤感失望的真相就会在杯底露出来了。他在店铺里走了一、两圈，从那些仪器中寻找希望，可是不管他能提出什么反对意见，它们都固执地计算出那条失踪的船的航程，指明它沉落在寂寞的海底。 风仍旧在狂吹，雨仍旧在打着关上的百叶窗；船长在柜台上的木制海军军官候补生的前面停住；当他用袖子擦干这位小军官的制服时，心中想道：这位海军军官候补生在这世界上已经度过了多少个岁月；在过去这些岁月中，他船上的船员们是很少发生变化的——几乎没有任何变化；但这些变化又怎样几乎在一天之内骤然一齐来临；它们又怎样具有一种摧毁一切的性质。在后客厅里的经常聚会如今已经土崩瓦解了；这一小群人如今离散四方，相距遥远。“可爱的配格姑娘”这支歌曲即使有人唱它，也没有听众了，而实际上并没有会唱它的人，因为船长确信，除了他本人之外，没有别人能唱这个小调，而他在目前的情况下又没有情绪去唱它。屋子里看不到沃尔特的欢乐的脸孔——这时船长的袖子离开了海军军官候补生的制服，在他自己的脸上擦了一会儿——；所尔·吉尔斯那熟悉的假发和钮扣已成为过去的幻影；理查德·惠廷顿遭到了当头一棒；与海军军官候补生有关的一切计划与打算，正在茫茫的海浪上漂流，既没有桅，也没有舵。 船长脸色沮丧，站在那里，反复思考着这些事情，同时擦着海军军官候补生；他在擦的时候，部分地怀着对一位老朋友的亲切情谊，部分地又有些心不在焉；就在这时候，店门上突然响起了敲门声，这使坐在柜台上的磨工罗布顿时惊恐地哆嗦了一下；在这之前，他的大眼睛一直在聚精会神地注视着船长的脸孔，心中千百次地思考着这个问题：船长是不是杀了人，深感内疚，所以一直在想逃跑呢？ “什么事？”卡特尔船长低声问道。 “有人敲门，船长，”磨工罗布回答道。 船长露出羞愧和有罪的神色，立即踮着脚尖，偷偷地溜进了小客厅，把自己锁在里面。罗布开了门，如果来访的人是穿着女装的话，他本准备好在门口跟她谈判一番的，可是他是个男的，而罗布所接受的命令只适用于妇女，所以罗布把门打开，让他进来。那人急忙走进，高兴地躲避了外面的滂沱大雨。 “伯吉斯公司又有活好干了，”来访的人说道，一边怜惜地回过头看看他的裤子；裤子被淋得很湿，溅满了污泥，“啊，吉尔斯先生，您好吗？” 这问候的话是对着船长说的；船长这时从后客厅中走出来，极为明显和不熟练地假装成偶尔来到这里似的。 “谢谢您，”那位先生没有停顿，一口气往下说道，“我自己确实很好，我很感谢您。我姓图茨，——图茨先生。” 船长记得在婚礼中看见过这位年轻人，就向他鞠了个躬。图茨先生吃吃地笑了一下，作为回答；然后，由于局促不安（就跟他通常的情况一样），就急促地喘气，和船长长时间地握手；然后，因为想不出别的主意，他转向磨工罗布，极为亲切和热诚地跟他握手。 “是这样的，如果您同意的话，我想跟您说一句话，吉尔斯先生，”图茨先生终于令人惊奇地镇静下来，说道，“是这样的！董贝小姐——您知道！” 船长用同样庄重与神秘的神态，立刻把他的钩子朝小客厅挥了一下，图茨先生就跟随着他走到那里。 “啊，我请您原谅，”图茨先生坐在船长替他放在炉边的椅子中，仰望着船长的脸孔，说道，“您也许不知道鸡吧，是不是，吉尔斯先生？” “鸡？”船长问道。 “斗鸡，”图茨先生说道。 船长摇了摇头，图茨先生就解释说，他所提到这个人是一位大名鼎鼎的人物，他曾经在跟诺贝·旋罗普希尔第一的竞赛中给他自己和祖国取得了光荣，但是这个消息并没有使船长十分领悟他的意思。 “问题是，他现在还站在外面的街道上；我所有的话都说完了，”图茨先生说道，“不过这无关紧要；也许他不会淋得很湿的。” “我立刻吩咐让他进来，”船长说道。 “唔，如果您肯行个好，允许他跟您的年轻人坐在店铺里的话，”图茨先生吃吃地笑道，“那么我将感到很高兴；因为，您知道，他是很容易生气的，而潮湿的天气对他体力很不利。 我去喊他进来吧，吉尔斯先生。” 图茨先生一边说，一边跑到店铺门口，向着黑暗的夜色吹了一个奇异的口哨；在这之后，出现了一位斯多噶派①的先生；他穿着一件毛茸茸的白色大衣，戴了一顶平边帽，头发剪得很短，鼻子是破的，每只耳朵后面都有一片很宽的地方，光光的，一根毛也没有。 “请坐，斗鸡，”图茨先生说道。 顺从的斗鸡吐出了几小根作为美餐的稻草，又从他手中的储备中塞了几根新的到嘴里。 “这里能找到一口酒润润嗓子吗？”斗鸡没有特别对着哪一个人说道，“这种多雨的天气对一个自力谋生的人来说真是要命！” 卡特尔船长递上一杯朗姆酒；斗鸡致了简短的祝酒词：“为我们大家的健康干杯！”然后，头往后一仰，就把整杯酒一滴不留地倒进了肚子，就像倒进一个酒桶里似的。当图茨先生和船长回到客厅，在炉前坐下来的时候，图茨先生说道： “吉尔斯先生——” “先别说！”船长说道，“我姓卡特尔。” 图茨先生露出一副张皇失措的神情，听船长庄严地继续说下去： “我叫卡特尔船长，我的祖国是英国，这里是我的住所。为宇宙万物祝福吧！这句话引自《约伯记》②。”船长指出了他引语的出处，说道。 -------- ①斯多噶派：哲学上的一种流派，他们是禁欲主义者，生活淡泊，坚忍无怨，不以苦乐为意。 ②《约伯记》：《旧约圣经》中的一篇；约伯是希伯来族长，以坚忍耐劳著称；《约伯记》就是记述他的故事。 “啊！我不能见到吉尔斯先生了，是不是？”图茨先生说道，“因为——” “如果您能见到所尔·吉尔斯，年轻人，”船长把他沉重的手搁在图茨先生的膝盖上，令人难忘地说道，“如果您能亲眼见到老所尔的话，那么您对我来说，就比顺风对平静海面上的船更受欢迎了。可是您不能见到所尔·吉尔斯了。为什么您不能见到所尔·吉尔斯呢？”船长说道，他从图茨先生的脸上看出，他在这位年轻人的心中留下了深刻的印象，“因为他是不可能见到的了。” 图茨先生处于焦虑不安的心情中，正准备回答说，这根本无关紧要，但是他立即醒悟过来，说道，“天主，保佑我吧！” “这个人，”船长说，“写了一个条子留给我，托我在这里照管这里的一切；虽然他好得就像是我的结拜弟兄一样，可是我并不比您更知道他到哪里去了，也不比您更知道他为什么走了；或许他是去寻找他的外甥，或许是他的头脑有毛病。有一天早上，天刚蒙蒙亮，他从船边跳下去了，”船长说道，“没有溅起一朵水花，也没有生出一圈涟漪；我走遍了四处去寻找这个人，可是从那时以后，我的眼睛就没有再看见过他的身影，我的耳朵就没有再听到过他的；关于他的下落，一点音讯也没有。” “可是，我的天哪，董贝小姐不知道——”图茨先生开始说道。 “可是，我问您，您这个好心的人，”船长放低了，说道，“为什么她要知道？为什么在对她毫无益处的时候要让她知道？她，这个可爱的人儿，爱老所尔·吉尔斯，是那么亲切，那么温存，那么——说这些有什么好处呢？您知道她。” “我希望这样，”图茨先生吃吃地笑道，他感到自己整个脸孔都涨得通红了。 “您是从她那里来的吗？”船长问道。 “我想是的，”图茨先生吃吃地笑道。 “那么我需要说的是，”船长说道，“您认识了一位天使，天使给您发了特许执照。” 图茨先生立即抓住了船长的手，请求能得到他的友谊。 “说实话，我以荣誉发誓，”图茨先生恳切地说道，“如果您肯答应我跟您的交情比现在更亲密一些的话，那么我真会非常感谢您。我喜欢跟您相识，船长。我非常需要有一位朋友。在老布林伯的学校里，小董贝是我的朋友。如果他活着的话，那么现在也还是我的朋友。斗鸡，”图茨先生用可怜的低声说道，“很不错——是个别具才干的人——也许是世界上最机警聪明的人，他没有什么不会的，人人都这么说——可是我不知道——光有他还不够啊。——不错，她是天使，船长。如果世界上有天使的话，这就是董贝小姐——这是我经常说的。说真的，如果您肯跟我交往的话，那么我真会非常感谢您。” 卡特尔船长彬彬有礼地听取了这个建议，但仍然没有许下诺言来接受它，他仅仅说道，“是的，是的，我的孩子，我们以后看吧，我们以后看吧。”接着问他这次为什么前来访问，因而向图茨先生提醒了他当前的使命。 “唔，事情是这样的，”图茨先生回答道，“我是从那位姑娘那里来的。我说的并不是董贝小姐，您知道，我说的是苏珊。” 船长脸上露出庄重的神情点了一下头，表示他对那位姑娘怀着极大的尊敬。 “我想告诉您这是怎么发生的，”图茨先生说道，“您知道，我有时前去访问董贝小姐。您知道，我并不是特意到那里去的，但我时常碰巧去到邻近的地方，而当我发现到了那里时，嗯——嗯，我就去拜访她了。” “自然而然地，”船长说道。 “是的，”图茨先生说道，“今天下午我去拜访了。说实话，我以我的荣誉发誓，我认为要想象董贝小姐今天下午是何等模样的天使是不可能的。” 船长有力地点了一下头，表示有些人可能是不容易想象的，但对他来说，这却是相当容易的。 “当我要离开的时候，”图茨先生说，“那位姑娘完全出乎我的意料之外，把我领到餐具室中。” 船长似乎对这行动一时感到不高兴；他背靠着椅子，露出不信任的（如果不说是威胁的）神色，看着图茨先生。 “她在那里取出这张报纸，”图茨先生说道，“她告诉我，她把它藏了一整天没给董贝小姐看，因为报纸上有一段什么消息说到她和董贝过去都认识的一个什么人；然后她就把那段消息念给我听。念得很好。然后她说——请等一下子—— 她是怎么说的？” 图茨先生竭力设法把他的脑力集中到这个问题上的时候，无意间碰上了船长的眼光；船长严厉的神色使他心慌意乱，因此他要回到原来的话题更加困难了，简直达到了痛苦的程度。 “哦！”图茨先生经过长时间的思索之后，说道，“哦，啊！对了！她说，她希望还有一星半点的可能性：这消息也许不确实。因为她自己出来不能不惊动董贝小姐，所以问我能不能到这条街上来找仪器制造商所罗门·吉尔斯（他是当事人的舅舅），问问他是不是相信这是确实的，或者他是不是在城里听到别的事情。她说，如果他不能跟我说，那么卡特尔船长毫无疑问是能跟我说的。顺便说说！”当这一意外的发现掠过他的心头时，图茨先生喊道，“您，您知道！” 船长往图茨先生手中的报纸看了一眼，急促地喘着气。 “唔，”图茨先生继续说道，“我来得这么晚的原因是因为我首先到芬奇利这么远的地方去给董贝小姐的鸟儿采一些繁缕，那里生长的繁缕非常好。但是在这之后我就立即到这里来了。我想，您已看到这份报纸了吧？”
