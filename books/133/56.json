{"id":3804,"no":56,"title":"Chapter 56","content":"Several People delighted, and the Game Chicken disgusted\\n\\n The Midshipman was all alive. Mr Toots and Susan had arrived at last. Susan had run upstairs like a young woman bereft of her senses, and Mr Toots and the Chicken had gone into the Parlour.\\n\\n \u0027Oh my own pretty darling sweet Miss Floy!\u0027 cried the Nipper, running into Florence\u0027s room, \u0027to think that it should come to this and I should find you here my own dear dove with nobody to wait upon you and no home to call your own but never never will I go away again Miss Floy for though I may not gather moss I\u0027m not a rolling stone nor is my heart a stone or else it wouldn\u0027t bust as it is busting now oh dear oh dear!\u0027\\n\\n Pouring out these words, without the faintest indication of a stop, of any sort, Miss Nipper, on her knees beside her mistress, hugged her close.\\n\\n \u0027Oh love!\u0027 cried Susan, \u0027I know all that\u0027s past I know it all my tender pet and I\u0027m a choking give me air!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Susan, dear good Susan!\u0027 said Florence. \u0027Oh bless her! I that was her little maid when she was a little child! and is she really, really truly going to be married?\u0027exclaimed Susan, in a burst of pain and pleasure, pride and grief, and Heaven knows how many other conflicting feelings.\\n\\n \u0027Who told you so?\u0027 said Florence.\\n\\n \u0027Oh gracious me! that innocentest creetur Toots,\u0027 returned Susan hysterically. \u0027I knew he must be right my dear, because he took on so. He\u0027s the devotedest and innocentest infant! And is my darling,\u0027 pursued Susan, with another close embrace and burst of tears, \u0027really really going to be married!\u0027\\n\\n The mixture of compassion, pleasure, tenderness, protection, and regret with which the Nipper constantly recurred to this subject, and at every such once, raised her head to look in the young face and kiss it, and then laid her head again upon her mistress\u0027s shoulder, caressing her and sobbing, was as womanly and good a thing, in its way, as ever was seen in the world.\\n\\n \u0027There, there!\u0027 said the soothing voice of Florence presently. \u0027Now you\u0027re quite yourself, dear Susan!\u0027\\n\\n Miss Nipper, sitting down upon the floor, at her mistress\u0027s feet, laughing and sobbing, holding her pocket-handkerchief to her eyes with one hand, and patting Diogenes with the other as he licked her face, confessed to being more composed, and laughed and cried a little more in proof of it.\\n\\n \u0027I-I-I never did see such a creetur as that Toots,\u0027 said Susan, \u0027in all my born days never!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So kind,\u0027 suggested Florence.\\n\\n \u0027And so comic!\u0027 Susan sobbed. \u0027The way he\u0027s been going on inside with me with that disrespectable Chicken on the box!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About what, Susan?\u0027 inquired Florence, timidly.\\n\\n \u0027Oh about Lieutenant Walters, and Captain Gills, and you my dear Miss Floy, and the silent tomb,\u0027 said Susan.\\n\\n \u0027The silent tomb!\u0027 repeated Florence.\\n\\n \u0027He says,\u0027 here Susan burst into a violent hysterical laugh, \u0027that he\u0027ll go down into it now immediately and quite comfortable, but bless your heart my dear Miss Floy he won\u0027t, he\u0027s a great deal too happy in seeing other people happy for that, he may not be a Solomon,\u0027 pursued the Nipper, with her usual volubility, \u0027nor do I say he is but this I do say a less selfish human creature human nature never knew!\u0027 Miss Nipper being still hysterical, laughed immoderately after making this energetic declaration, and then informed Florence that he was waiting below to see her; which would be a rich repayment for the trouble he had had in his late expedition.\\n\\n Florence entreated Susan to beg of Mr Toots as a favour that she might have the pleasure of thanking him for his kindness; and Susan, in a few moments, produced that young gentleman, still very much dishevelled in appearance, and stammering exceedingly.\\n\\n \u0027Miss Dombey,\u0027 said Mr Toots. \u0027To be again permitted to - to - gaze - at least, not to gaze, but - I don\u0027t exactly know what I was going to say, but it\u0027s of no consequence.\\n\\n \u0027I have to thank you so often,\u0027 returned Florence, giving him both her hands, with all her innocent gratitude beaming in her face, \u0027that I have no words left, and don\u0027t know how to do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Miss Dombey,\u0027 said Mr Toots, in an awful voice, \u0027if it was possible that you could, consistently with your angelic nature, Curse me, you would - if I may be allowed to say so - floor me infinitely less, than by these undeserved expressions of kindness Their effect upon me - is - but,\u0027 said Mr Toots, abruptly, \u0027this is a digression, and of no consequence at all.\u0027\\n\\n As there seemed to be no means of replying to this, but by thanking him again, Florence thanked him again.\\n\\n \u0027I could wish,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027to take this opportunity, Miss Dombey, if I might, of entering into a word of explanation. I should have had the pleasure of - of returning with Susan at an earlier period; but, in the first place, we didn\u0027t know the name of the relation to whose house she had gone, and, in the second, as she had left that relation\u0027s and gone to another at a distance, I think that scarcely anything short of the sagacity of the Chicken, would have found her out in the time.\u0027\\n\\n Florence was sure of it.\\n\\n \u0027This, however,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027is not the point. The company of Susan has been, I assure you, Miss Dombey, a consolation and satisfaction to me, in my state of mind, more easily conceived than described. The journey has been its own reward. That, however, still, is not the point. Miss Dombey, I have before observed that I know I am not what is considered a quick person. I am perfectly aware of that. I don\u0027t think anybody could be better acquainted with his own - if it was not too strong an expression, I should say with the thickness of his own head - than myself. But, Miss Dombey, I do, notwithstanding, perceive the state of - of things - with Lieutenant Walters. Whatever agony that state of things may have caused me (which is of no consequence at all), I am bound to say, that Lieutenant Walters is a person who appears to be worthy of the blessing that has fallen on his - on his brow. May he wear it long, and appreciate it, as a very different, and very unworthy individual, that it is of no consequence to name, would have done! That, however, still, is not the point. Miss Dombey, Captain Gills is a friend of mine; and during the interval that is now elapsing, I believe it would afford Captain Gills pleasure to see me occasionally coming backwards and forwards here. It would afford me pleasure so to come. But I cannot forget that I once committed myself, fatally, at the corner of the Square at Brighton; and if my presence will be, in the least degree, unpleasant to you, I only ask you to name it to me now, and assure you that I shall perfectly understand you. I shall not consider it at all unkind, and shall only be too delighted and happy to be honoured with your confidence.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr Toots,\u0027 returned Florence, \u0027if you, who are so old and true a friend of mine, were to stay away from this house now, you would make me very unhappy. It can never, never, give me any feeling but pleasure to see you.\\n\\n \u0027Miss Dombey,\u0027 said Mr Toots, taking out his pocket-handkerchief, \u0027if I shed a tear, it is a tear of joy. It is of no consequence, and I am very much obliged to you. I may be allowed to remark, after what you have so kindly said, that it is not my intention to neglect my person any longer.\u0027\\n\\n Florence received this intimation with the prettiest expression of perplexity possible.\\n\\n \u0027I mean,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027that I shall consider it my duty as a fellow-creature generally, until I am claimed by the silent tomb, to make the best of myself, and to - to have my boots as brightly polished, as - as -circumstances will admit of. This is the last time, Miss Dombey, of my intruding any observation of a private and personal nature. I thank you very much indeed. if I am not, in a general way, as sensible as my friends could wish me to be, or as I could wish myself, I really am, upon my word and honour, particularly sensible of what is considerate and kind. I feel,\u0027 said Mr Toots, in an impassioned tone, \u0027as if I could express my feelings, at the present moment, in a most remarkable manner, if - if - I could only get a start.\u0027\\n\\n Appearing not to get it, after waiting a minute or two to see if it would come, Mr Toots took a hasty leave, and went below to seek the Captain, whom he found in the shop.\\n\\n \u0027Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027what is now to take place between us, takes place under the sacred seal of confidence. It is the sequel, Captain Gills, of what has taken place between myself and Miss Dombey, upstairs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Alow and aloft, eh, my lad?\u0027 murmured the Captain.\\n\\n \u0027Exactly so, Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots, whose fervour of acquiescence was greatly heightened by his entire ignorance of the Captain\u0027s meaning. \u0027Miss Dombey, I believe, Captain Gills, is to be shortly united to Lieutenant Walters?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why, ay, my lad. We\u0027re all shipmets here, - Wal\u0027r and sweet- heart will be jined together in the house of bondage, as soon as the askings is over,\u0027 whispered Captain Cuttle, in his ear.\\n\\n \u0027The askings, Captain Gills!\u0027 repeated Mr Toots.\\n\\n \u0027In the church, down yonder,\u0027 said the Captain, pointing his thumb over his shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Oh! Yes!\u0027 returned Mr Toots.\\n\\n \u0027And then,\u0027 said the Captain, in his hoarse whisper, and tapping Mr Toots on the chest with the back of his hand, and falling from him with a look of infinite admiration, \u0027what follers? That there pretty creetur, as delicately brought up as a foreign bird, goes away upon the roaring main with Wal\u0027r on a woyage to China!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lord, Captain Gills!\u0027 said Mr Toots.\\n\\n \u0027Ay!\u0027 nodded the Captain. \u0027The ship as took him up, when he was wrecked in the hurricane that had drove her clean out of her course, was a China trader, and Wal\u0027r made the woyage, and got into favour, aboard and ashore - being as smart and good a lad as ever stepped - and so, the supercargo dying at Canton, he got made (having acted as clerk afore), and now he\u0027s supercargo aboard another ship, same owners. And so, you see,\u0027 repeated the Captain, thoughtfully, \u0027the pretty creetur goes away upon the roaring main with Wal\u0027r, on a woyage to China.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Toots and Captain Cuttle heaved a sigh in concert. \u0027What then?\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027She loves him true. He loves her true. Them as should have loved and tended of her, treated of her like the beasts as perish. When she, cast out of home, come here to me, and dropped upon them planks, her wownded heart was broke. I know it. I, Ed\u0027ard Cuttle, see it. There\u0027s nowt but true, kind, steady love, as can ever piece it up again. If so be I didn\u0027t know that, and didn\u0027t know as Wal\u0027r was her true love, brother, and she his, I\u0027d have these here blue arms and legs chopped off, afore I\u0027d let her go. But I know it, and what then! Why, then, I say, Heaven go with \u0027em both, and so it will! Amen!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027let me have the pleasure of shaking hands You\u0027ve a way of saying things, that gives me an agreeable warmth, all up my back. I say Amen. You are aware, Captain Gills, that I, too, have adored Miss Dombey.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cheer up!\u0027 said the Captain, laying his hand on Mr Toots\u0027s shoulder. \u0027Stand by, boy!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is my intention, Captain Gills,\u0027 returned the spirited Mr Toots, \u0027to cheer up. Also to standby, as much as possible. When the silent tomb shall yawn, Captain Gills, I shall be ready for burial; not before. But not being certain, just at present, of my power over myself, what I wish to say to you, and what I shall take it as a particular favour if you will mention to Lieutenant Walters, is as follows.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is as follers,\u0027 echoed the Captain. \u0027Steady!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Miss Dombey being so inexpressably kind,\u0027 continued Mr Toots with watery eyes, \u0027as to say that my presence is the reverse of disagreeable to her, and you and everybody here being no less forbearing and tolerant towards one who - who certainly,\u0027 said Mr Toots, with momentary dejection, \u0027would appear to have been born by mistake, I shall come backwards and forwards of an evening, during the short time we can all be together. But what I ask is this. If, at any moment, I find that I cannot endure the contemplation of Lieutenant Walters\u0027s bliss, and should rush out, I hope, Captain Gills, that you and he will both consider it as my misfortune and not my fault, or the want of inward conflict. That you\u0027ll feel convinced I bear no malice to any living creature-least of all to Lieutenant Walters himself - and that you\u0027ll casually remark that I have gone out for a walk, or probably to see what o\u0027clock it is by the Royal Exchange. Captain Gills, if you could enter into this arrangement, and could answer for Lieutenant Walters, it would be a relief to my feelings that I should think cheap at the sacrifice of a considerable portion of my property.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My lad,\u0027 returned the Captain, \u0027say no more. There ain\u0027t a colour you can run up, as won\u0027t be made out, and answered to, by Wal\u0027r and self.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027my mind is greatly relieved. I wish to preserve the good opinion of all here. I - I - mean well, upon my honour, however badly I may show it. You know,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027it\u0027s as exactly as Burgess and Co. wished to oblige a customer with a most extraordinary pair of trousers, and could not cut out what they had in their minds.\u0027\\n\\n With this apposite illustration, of which he seemed a little Proud, Mr Toots gave Captain Cuttle his blessing and departed.\\n\\n The honest Captain, with his Heart\u0027s Delight in the house, and Susan tending her, was a beaming and a happy man. As the days flew by, he grew more beaming and more happy, every day. After some conferences with Susan (for whose wisdom the Captain had a profound respect, and whose valiant precipitation of herself on Mrs MacStinger he could never forget), he proposed to Florence that the daughter of the elderly lady who usually sat under the blue umbrella in Leadenhall Market, should, for prudential reasons and considerations of privacy, be superseded in the temporary discharge of the household duties, by someone who was not unknown to them, and in whom they could safely confide. Susan, being present, then named, in furtherance of a suggestion she had previously offered to the Captain, Mrs Richards. Florence brightened at the name. And Susan, setting off that very afternoon to the Toodle domicile, to sound Mrs Richards, returned in triumph the same evening, accompanied by the identical rosy-cheeked apple-faced Polly, whose demonstrations, when brought into Florence\u0027s presence, were hardly less affectionate than those of Susan Nipper herself.\\n\\n This piece of generalship accomplished; from which the Captain derived uncommon satisfaction, as he did, indeed, from everything else that was done, whatever it happened to be; Florence had next to prepare Susan for their approaching separation. This was a much more difficult task, as Miss Nipper was of a resolute disposition, and had fully made up her mind that she had come back never to be parted from her old mistress any more.\\n\\n \u0027As to wages dear Miss Floy,\u0027 she said, \u0027you wouldn\u0027t hint and wrong me so as think of naming them, for I\u0027ve put money by and wouldn\u0027t sell my love and duty at a time like this even if the Savings\u0027 Banks and me were total strangers or the Banks were broke to pieces, but you\u0027ve never been without me darling from the time your poor dear Ma was took away, and though I\u0027m nothing to be boasted of you\u0027re used to me and oh my own dear mistress through so many years don\u0027t think of going anywhere without me, for it mustn\u0027t and can\u0027t be!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dear Susan, I am going on a long, long voyage.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well Miss Floy, and what of that? the more you\u0027ll want me. Lengths of voyages ain\u0027t an object in my eyes, thank God!\u0027 said the impetuous Susan Nipper.\\n\\n \u0027But, Susan, I am going with Walter, and I would go with Walter anywhere - everywhere! Walter is poor, and I am very poor, and I must learn, now, both to help myself, and help him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dear Miss Floy!\u0027 cried Susan, bursting out afresh, and shaking her head violently, \u0027it\u0027s nothing new to you to help yourself and others too and be the patientest and truest of noble hearts, but let me talk to Mr Walter Gay and settle it with him, for suffer you to go away across the world alone I cannot, and I won\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Alone, Susan?\u0027 returned Florence. \u0027Alone? and Walter taking me with him!\u0027 Ah, what a bright, amazed, enraptured smile was on her face! - He should have seen it. \u0027I am sure you will not speak to Walter if I ask you not,\u0027 she added tenderly; \u0027and pray don\u0027t, dear.\u0027\\n\\n Susan sobbed \u0027Why not, Miss Floy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because,\u0027 said Florence, \u0027I am going to be his wife, to give him up my whole heart, and to live with him and die with him. He might think, if you said to him what you have said to me, that I am afraid of what is before me, or that you have some cause to be afraid for me. Why, Susan, dear, I love him!\u0027\\n\\n Miss Nipper was so much affected by the quiet fervour of these words, and the simple, heartfelt, all-pervading earnestness expressed in them, and making the speaker\u0027s face more beautiful and pure than ever, that she could only cling to her again, crying. Was her little mistress really, really going to be married, and pitying, caressing, and protecting her, as she had done before. But the Nipper, though susceptible of womanly weaknesses, was almost as capable of putting constraint upon herself as of attacking the redoubtable MacStinger. From that time, she never returned to the subject, but was always cheerful, active, bustling, and hopeful. She did, indeed, inform Mr Toots privately, that she was only \u0027keeping up\u0027 for the time, and that when it was all over, and Miss Dombey was gone, she might be expected to become a spectacle distressful; and Mr Toots did also express that it was his case too, and that they would mingle their tears together; but she never otherwise indulged her private feelings in the presence of Florence or within the precincts of the Midshipman.\\n\\n Limited and plain as Florence\u0027s wardrobe was - what a contrast to that prepared for the last marriage in which she had taken part! - there was a good deal to do in getting it ready, and Susan Nipper worked away at her side, all day, with the concentrated zeal of fifty sempstresses. The wonderful contributions Captain Cuttle would have made to this branch of the outfit, if he had been permitted - as pink parasols, tinted silk stockings, blue shoes, and other articles no less necessary on shipboard - would occupy some space in the recital. He was induced, however, by various fraudulent representations, to limit his contributions to a work-box and dressing case, of each of which he purchased the very largest specimen that could be got for money. For ten days or a fortnight afterwards, he generally sat, during the greater part of the day, gazing at these boxes; divided between extreme admiration of them, and dejected misgivings that they were not gorgeous enough, and frequently diving out into the street to purchase some wild article that he deemed necessary to their completeness. But his master-stroke was, the bearing of them both off, suddenly, one morning, and getting the two words FLORENCE GAY engraved upon a brass heart inlaid over the lid of each. After this, he smoked four pipes successively in the little parlour by himself, and was discovered chuckling, at the expiration of as many hours.\\n\\n Walter was busy and away all day, but came there every morning early to see Florence, and always passed the evening with her. Florence never left her high rooms but to steal downstairs to wait for him when it was his time to come, or, sheltered by his proud, encircling arm, to bear him company to the door again, and sometimes peep into the street. In the twilight they were always together. Oh blessed time! Oh wandering heart at rest! Oh deep, exhaustless, mighty well of love, in which so much was sunk!\\n\\n The cruel mark was on her bosom yet. It rose against her father with the breath she drew, it lay between her and her lover when he pressed her to his heart. But she forgot it. In the beating of that heart for her, and in the beating of her own for him, all harsher music was unheard, all stern unloving hearts forgotten. Fragile and delicate she was, but with a might of love within her that could, and did, create a world to fly to, and to rest in, out of his one image.\\n\\n How often did the great house, and the old days, come before her in the twilight time, when she was sheltered by the arm, so proud, so fond, and, creeping closer to him, shrunk within it at the recollection! How often, from remembering the night when she went down to that room and met the never-to-be forgotten look, did she raise her eyes to those that watched her with such loving earnestness, and weep with happiness in such a refuge! The more she clung to it, the more the dear dead child was in her thoughts: but as if the last time she had seen her father, had been when he was sleeping and she kissed his face, she always left him so, and never, in her fancy, passed that hour.\\n\\n \u0027Walter, dear,\u0027 said Florence, one evening, when it was almost dark.\u0027Do you know what I have been thinking to-day?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thinking how the time is flying on, and how soon we shall be upon the sea, sweet Florence?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t mean that, Walter, though I think of that too. I have been thinking what a charge I am to you.\\n\\n \u0027A precious, sacred charge, dear heart! Why, I think that sometimes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are laughing, Walter. I know that\u0027s much more in your thoughts than mine. But I mean a cost.\\n\\n \u0027A cost, my own?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In money, dear. All these preparations that Susan and I are so busy with - I have been able to purchase very little for myself. You were poor before. But how much poorer I shall make you, Walter!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how much richer, Florence!\u0027\\n\\n Florence laughed, and shook her head.\\n\\n \u0027Besides,\u0027 said Walter, \u0027long ago - before I went to sea - I had a little purse presented to me, dearest, which had money in it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 returned Florence, laughing sorrowfully, \u0027very little! very little, Walter! But, you must not think,\u0027 and here she laid her light hand on his shoulder, and looked into his face, \u0027that I regret to be this burden on you. No, dear love, I am glad of it. I am happy in it. I wouldn\u0027t have it otherwise for all the world!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nor I, indeed, dear Florence.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ay! but, Walter, you can never feel it as I do. I am so proud of you! It makes my heart swell with such delight to know that those who speak of you must say you married a poor disowned girl, who had taken shelter here; who had no other home, no other friends; who had nothing - nothing! Oh, Walter, if I could have brought you millions, I never could have been so happy for your sake, as I am!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you, dear Florence? are you nothing?\u0027 he returned.\\n\\n \u0027No, nothing, Walter. Nothing but your wife.\u0027 The light hand stole about his neck, and the voice came nearer - nearer. \u0027I am nothing any more, that is not you. I have no earthly hope any more, that is not you. I have nothing dear to me any more, that is not you.\\n\\n Oh! well might Mr Toots leave the little company that evening, and twice go out to correct his watch by the Royal Exchange, and once to keep an appointment with a banker which he suddenly remembered, and once to take a little turn to Aldgate Pump and back!\\n\\n But before he went upon these expeditions, or indeed before he came, and before lights were brought, Walter said:\\n\\n \u0027Florence, love, the lading of our ship is nearly finished, and probably on the very day of our marriage she will drop down the river. Shall we go away that morning, and stay in Kent until we go on board at Gravesend within a week?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you please, Walter. I shall be happy anywhere. But - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, my life?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know,\u0027 said Florence, \u0027that we shall have no marriage party, and that nobody will distinguish us by our dress from other people. As we leave the same day, will you - will you take me somewhere that morning, Walter - early - before we go to church?\u0027\\n\\n Walter seemed to understand her, as so true a lover so truly loved should, and confirmed his ready promise with a kiss - with more than one perhaps, or two or threes or five or six; and in the grave, peaceful evening, Florence was very happy.\\n\\n Then into the quiet room came Susan Nipper and the candles; shortly afterwards, the tea, the Captain, and the excursive Mr Toots, who, as above mentioned, was frequently on the move afterwards, and passed but a restless evening. This, however, was not his habit: for he generally got on very well, by dint of playing at cribbage with the Captain under the advice and guidance of Miss Nipper, and distracting his mind with the calculations incidental to the game; which he found to be a very effectual means of utterly confounding himself.\\n\\n The Captain\u0027s visage on these occasions presented one of the finest examples of combination and succession of expression ever observed. His instinctive delicacy and his chivalrous feeling towards Florence, taught him that it was not a time for any boisterous jollity, or violent display of satisfaction; floating reminiscences of Lovely Peg, on the other hand, were constantly struggling for a vent, and urging the Captain to commit himself by some irreparable demonstration. Anon, his admiration of Florence and Walter - well-matched, truly, and full of grace and interest in their youth, and love, and good looks, as they sat apart - would take such complete possession of hIm, that he would lay down his cards, and beam upon them, dabbing his head all over with his pockethandkerchief; until warned, perhaps, by the sudden rushing forth of Mr Toots, that he had unconsciously been very instrumental, indeed, in making that gentleman miserable. This reflection would make the Captain profoundly melancholy, until the return of Mr Toots; when he would fall to his cards again, with many side winks and nods, and polite waves of his hook at Miss Nipper, importing that he wasn\u0027t going to do so any more. The state that ensued on this, was, perhaps, his best; for then, endeavouring to discharge all expression from his face, he would sit staring round the room, with all these expressions conveyed into it at once, and each wrestling with the other. Delighted admiration of Florence and Walter always overthrew the rest, and remained victorious and undisguised, unless Mr Toots made another rush into the air, and then the Captain would sit, like a remorseful culprit, until he came back again, occasionally calling upon himself, in a low reproachful voice, to \u0027Stand by!\u0027 or growling some remonstrance to \u0027Ed\u0027ard Cuttle, my lad,\u0027 on the want of caution observabl in his behaviour.\\n\\n One of Mr Toots\u0027s hardest trials, however, was of his own seeking. On the approach of the Sunday which was to witness the last of those askings in church of which the Captain had spoken, Mr Toots thus stated his feelings to Susan Nipper.\\n\\n \u0027Susan,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027I am drawn towards the building. The words which cut me off from Miss Dombey for ever, will strike upon my ears like a knell you know, but upon my word and honour, I feel that I must hear them. Therefore,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027will you accompany me to-morrow, to the sacred edifice?\u0027\\n\\n Miss Nipper expressed her readiness to do so, if that would be any satisfaction to Mr Toots, but besought him to abandon his idea of going.\\n\\n \u0027Susan,\u0027 returned Mr Toots, with much solemnity, \u0027before my whiskers began to be observed by anybody but myself, I adored Miss Dombey. While yet a victim to the thraldom of Blimber, I adored Miss Dombey. When I could no longer be kept out of my property, in a legal point of view, and - and accordingly came into it - I adored Miss Dombey. The banns which consign her to Lieutenant Walters, and me to - to Gloom, you know,\u0027 said Mr Toots, after hesitating for a strong expression, \u0027may be dreadful, will be dreadful; but I feel that I should wish to hear them spoken. I feel that I should wish to know that the ground wascertainly cut from under me, and that I hadn\u0027t a hope to cherish, or a - or a leg, in short, to - to go upon.\u0027\\n\\n Susan Nipper could only commiserate Mr Toots\u0027s unfortunate condition, and agree, under these circumstances, to accompany him; which she did next morning.\\n\\n The church Walter had chosen for the purpose, was a mouldy old church in a yard, hemmed in by a labyrinth of back streets and courts, with a little burying-ground round it, and itself buried in a kind of vault, formed by the neighbouring houses, and paved with echoing stones It was a great dim, shabby pile, with high old oaken pews, among which about a score of people lost themselves every Sunday; while the clergyman\u0027s voice drowsily resounded through the emptiness, and the organ rumbled and rolled as if the church had got the colic, for want of a congregation to keep the wind and damp out. But so far was this city church from languishing for the company of other churches, that spires were clustered round it, as the masts of shipping cluster on the river. It would have been hard to count them from its steeple-top, they were so many. In almost every yard and blind-place near, there was a church. The confusion of bells when Susan and Mr Toots betook themselves towards it on the Sunday morning, was deafening. There were twenty churches close together, clamouring for people to come in.\\n\\n The two stray sheep in question were penned by a beadle in a commodious pew, and, being early, sat for some time counting the congregation, listening to the disappointed bell high up in the tower, or looking at a shabby little old man in the porch behind the screen, who was ringing the same, like the Bull in Cock Robin,\u0027 with his foot in a stirrup. Mr Toots, after a lengthened survey of the large books on the reading-desk, whispered Miss Nipper that he wondered where the banns were kept, but that young lady merely shook her head and frowned; repelling for the time all approaches of a temporal nature.\\n\\n Mr Toots, however, appearing unable to keep his thoughts from the banns, was evidently looking out for them during the whole preliminary portion of the service. As the time for reading them approached, the poor young gentleman manifested great anxiety and trepidation, which was not diminished by the unexpected apparition of the Captain in the front row of the gallery. When the clerk handed up a list to the clergyman, Mr Toots, being then seated, held on by the seat of the pew; but when the names of Walter Gay and Florence Dombey were read aloud as being in the third and last stage of that association, he was so entirley conquered by his feelings as to rush from the church without his hat, followed by the beadle and pew-opener, and two gentlemen of the medical profeesion, who happened to be present; of whom the first-named presently returned for that article, informing Miss Nipper in a whisper that she was not to make herself uneasy about the gentleman, as the gentleman said his indisposition was of no consequence.\\n\\n Miss Nipper, feeling that the eyes of that integral portion of Europe which lost itself weekly among the high-backed pews, were upon her, would have been sufficient embarrassed by this incident, though it had terminated here; the more so, as the Captain in the front row of the gallery, was in a state of unmitigated consciousness which could hardly fail to express to the congregation that he had some mysterious connection with it. But the extreme restlessness of Mr Toots painfully increased and protracted the delicacy of her situation. That young gentleman, incapable, in his state of mind, of remaining alone in the churchyard, a prey to solitary meditation, and also desirous, no doubt, of testifying his respect for the offices he had in some measure interrupted, suddenly returned - not coming back to the pew, but stationing himself on a free seat in the aisle, between two elderly females who were in the habit of receiving their portion of a weekly dole of bread then set forth on a shelf in the porch. In this conjunction Mr Toots remained, greatly disturbing the congregation, who felt it impossible to avoid looking at him, until his feelings overcame him again, when he departed silently and suddenly. Not venturing to trust himself in the church any more, and yet wishing to have some social participation in what was going on there, Mr Toots was, after this, seen from time to time, looking in, with a lorn aspect, at one or other of the windows; and as there were several windows accessible to him from without, and as his restlessness was very great, it not only became difficult to conceive at which window he would appear next, but likewise became necessary, as it were, for the whole congregation to speculate upon the chances of the different windows, during the comparative leisure afforded them by the sermon. Mr Toots\u0027s movements in the churchyard were so eccentric, that he seemed generally to defeat all calculation, and to appear, like the conjuror\u0027s figure, where he was least expected; and the effect of these mysterious presentations was much increased by its being difficult to him to see in, and easy to everybody else to see out: which occasioned his remaining, every time, longer than might have been expected, with his face close to the glass, until he all at once became aware that all eyes were upon him, and vanished.\\n\\n These proceedings on the part of Mr Toots, and the strong individual consciousness of them that was exhibited by the Captain, rendered Miss Nipper\u0027s position so responsible a one, that she was mightily relieved by the conclusion of the service; and was hardly so affable to Mr Toots as usual, when he informed her and the Captain, on the way back, that now he was sure he had no hope, you know, he felt more comfortable - at least not exactly more comfortable, but more comfortably and completely miserable.\\n\\n Swiftly now, indeed, the time flew by until it was the evening before the day appointed for the marriage. They were all assembled in the upper room at the Midshipman\u0027s, and had no fear of interruption; for there were no lodgers in the house now, and the Midshipman had it all to himself. They were grave and quiet in the prospect of to-morrow, but moderately cheerful too. Florence, with Walter close beside her, was finishing a little piece of work intended as a parting gift to the Captain. The Captain was playing cribbage with Mr Toots. Mr Toots was taking counsel as to his hand, of Susan Nipper. Miss Nipper was giving it, with all due secrecy and circumspection. Diogenes was listening, and occasionally breaking out into a gruff half-smothered fragment of a bark, of which he afterwards seemed half-ashamed, as if he doubted having any reason for it.\\n\\n \u0027Steady, steady!\u0027 said the Captain to Diogenes, \u0027what\u0027s amiss with you? You don\u0027t seem easy in your mind to-night, my boy!\u0027\\n\\n Diogenes wagged his tail, but pricked up his ears immediately afterwards, and gave utterance to another fragment of a bark; for which he apologised to the Captain, by again wagging his tail.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s my opinion, Di,\u0027 said the Captain, looking thoughtfully at his cards, and stroking his chin with his hook, \u0027as you have your doubts of Mrs Richards; but if you\u0027re the animal I take you to be, you\u0027ll think better o\u0027 that; for her looks is her commission. Now, Brother:\u0027 to Mr Toots: \u0027if so be as you\u0027re ready, heave ahead.\u0027\\n\\n The Captain spoke with all composure and attention to the game, but suddenly his cards dropped out of his hand, his mouth and eyes opened wide, his legs drew themselves up and stuck out in front of his chair, and he sat staring at the door with blank amazement. Looking round upon the company, and seeing that none of them observed him or the cause of his astonishment, the Captain recovered himself with a great gasp, struck the table a tremendous blow, cried in a stentorian roar, \u0027Sol Gills ahoy!\u0027 and tumbled into the arms of a weather-beaten pea-coat that had come with Polly into the room.\\n\\n In another moment, Walter was in the arms of the weather-beaten pea-coat. In another moment, Florence was in the arms of the weather-beaten pea-coat. In another moment, Captain Cuttle had embraced Mrs Richards and Miss Nipper, and was violently shaking hands with Mr Toots, exclaiming, as he waved his hook above his head, \u0027Hooroar, my lad, hooroar!\u0027 To which Mr Toots, wholly at a loss to account for these proceedings, replied with great politeness, \u0027Certainly, Captain Gills, whatever you think proper!\u0027\\n\\n The weather-beaten pea-coat, and a no less weather-beaten cap and comforter belonging to it, turned from the Captain and from Florence back to Walter, and sounds came from the weather-beaten pea-coat, cap, and comforter, as of an old man sobbing underneath them; while the shaggy sleeves clasped Walter tight. During this pause, there was an universal silence, and the Captain polished his nose with great diligence. But when the pea-coat, cap, and comforter lifted themselves up again, Florence gently moved towards them; and she and Walter taking them off, disclosed the old Instrument-maker, a little thinner and more careworn than of old, in his old Welsh wig and his old coffee-coloured coat and basket buttons, with his old infallible chronometer ticking away in his pocket.\\n\\n \u0027Chock full o\u0027 science,\u0027 said the radiant Captain, \u0027as ever he was! Sol Gills, Sol Gills, what have you been up to, for this many a long day, my ould boy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m half blind, Ned,\u0027 said the old man, \u0027and almost deaf and dumb with joy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027His wery woice,\u0027 said the Captain, looking round with an exultation to which even his face could hardly render justice - \u0027his wery woice as chock full o\u0027 science as ever it was! Sol Gills, lay to, my lad, upon your own wines and fig-trees like a taut ould patriark as you are, and overhaul them there adwentures o\u0027 yourn, in your own formilior woice. \u0027Tis the woice,\u0027 said the Captain, impressively, and announcing a quotation with his hook, \u0027of the sluggard, I heerd him complain, you have woke me too soon, I must slumber again. Scatter his ene-mies, and make \u0027em fall!\u0027\\n\\n The Captain sat down with the air of a man who had happily expressed the feeling of everybody present, and immediately rose again to present Mr Toots, who was much disconcerted by the arrival of anybody, appearing to prefer a claim to the name of Gills.\\n\\n \u0027Although,\u0027 stammered Mr Toots, \u0027I had not the pleasure of your acquaintance, Sir, before you were - you were - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lost to sight, to memory dear,\u0027 suggested the Captain, in a low voice.\\n\\n Exactly so, Captain Gills!\u0027 assented Mr Toots. \u0027Although I had not the pleasure of your acquaintance, Mr - Mr Sols,\u0027 said Toots, hitting on that name in the inspiration of a bright idea, \u0027before that happened, I have the greatest pleasure, I assure you, in - you know, in knowing you. I hope,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027that you\u0027re as well as can be expected.\u0027\\n\\n With these courteous words, Mr Toots sat down blushing and chuckling.\\n\\n The old Instrument-maker, seated in a corner between Walter and Florence, and nodding at Polly, who was looking on, all smiles and delight, answered the Captain thus:\\n\\n \u0027Ned Cuttle, my dear boy, although I have heard something of the changes of events here, from my pleasant friend there - what a pleasant face she has to be sure, to welcome a wanderer home!\u0027 said the old man, breaking off, and rubbing his hands in his old dreamy way.\\n\\n \u0027Hear him!\u0027 cried the Captain gravely. \u0027\u0027Tis woman as seduces all mankind. For which,\u0027 aside to Mr Toots, \u0027you\u0027ll overhaul your Adam and Eve, brother.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I shall make a point of doing so, Captain Gills,\u0027 said Mr Toots.\\n\\n \u0027Although I have heard something of the changes of events, from her,\u0027 resumed the Instrument-maker, taking his old spectacles from his pocket, and putting them on his forehead in his old manner, \u0027they are so great and unexpected, and I am so overpowered by the sight of my dear boy, and by the,\u0027 - glancing at the downcast eyes of Florence, and not attempting to finish the sentence - \u0027that I - I can\u0027t say much to-night. But my dear Ned Cuttle, why didn\u0027t you write?\u0027\\n\\n The astonishment depicted in the Captain\u0027s features positively frightened Mr Toots, whose eyes were quite fixed by it, so that he could not withdraw them from his face.\\n\\n \u0027Write!\u0027 echoed the Captain. \u0027Write, Sol Gills?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ay,\u0027 said the old man, \u0027either to Barbados, or Jamaica, or Demerara, That was what I asked.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What you asked, Sol Gills?\u0027 repeated the Captain.\\n\\n \u0027Ay,\u0027 said the old man. \u0027Don\u0027t you know, Ned? Sure you have not forgotten? Every time I wrote to you.\u0027\\n\\n The Captain took off his glazed hat, hung it on his hook, and smoothing his hair from behind with his hand, sat gazing at the group around him: a perfect image of wondering resignation.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t appear to understand me, Ned!\u0027 observed old Sol.\\n\\n \u0027Sol Gills,\u0027 returned the Captain, after staring at him and the rest for a long time, without speaking, \u0027I\u0027m gone about and adrift. Pay out a word or two respecting them adwenturs, will you! Can\u0027t I bring up, nohows? Nohows?\u0027 said the Captain, ruminating, and staring all round.\\n\\n \u0027You know, Ned,\u0027 said Sol Gills, \u0027why I left here. Did you open my packet, Ned?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why, ay, ay,\u0027 said the Captain. \u0027To be sure, I opened the packet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And read it?\u0027 said the old man.\\n\\n \u0027And read it,\u0027 answered the Captain, eyeing him attentively, and proceeding to quote it from memory. \u0027\"My dear Ned Cuttle, when I left home for the West Indies in forlorn search of intelligence of my dear-\" There he sits! There\u0027s Wal\u0027r!\u0027 said the Captain, as if he were relieved by getting hold of anything that was real and indisputable.\\n\\n \u0027Well, Ned. Now attend a moment!\u0027 said the old man. \u0027When I wrote first - that was from Barbados - I said that though you would receive that letter long before the year was out, I should be glad if you would open the packet, as it explained the reason of my going away. Very good, Ned. When I wrote the second, third, and perhaps the fourth times - that was from Jamaica - I said I was in just the same state, couldn\u0027t rest, and couldn\u0027t come away from that part of the world, without knowing that my boy was lost or saved. When I wrote next - that, I think, was from Demerara, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That he thinks was from Demerara, warn\u0027t it!\u0027 said the Captain, looking hopelessly round.\\n\\n \u0027I said,\u0027 proceeded old Sol, \u0027that still there was no certain information got yet. That I found many captains and others, in that part of the world, who had known me for years, and who assisted me with a passage here and there, and for whom I was able, now and then, to do a little in return, in my own craft. That everyone was sorry for me, and seemed to take a sort of interest in my wanderings; and that I began to think it would be my fate to cruise about in search of tidings of my boy, until I died.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Began to think as how he was a scientific Flying Dutchman!\u0027 said the Captain, as before, and with great seriousness.\\n\\n \u0027But when the news come one day, Ned, - that was to Barbados, after I got back there, - that a China trader home\u0027ard bound had been spoke, that had my boy aboard, then, Ned, I took passage in the next ship and came home; arrived at home to-night to find it true, thank God!\u0027 said the old man, devoutly.\\n\\n The Captain, after bowing his head with great reverence, stared all round the circle, beginning with Mr Toots, and ending with the Instrument-maker; then gravely said:\\n\\n \u0027Sol Gills! The observation as I\u0027m a-going to make is calc\u0027lated to blow every stitch of sail as you can carry, clean out of the bolt-ropes, and bring you on your beam ends with a lurch. Not one of them letters was ever delivered to Ed\u0027ard Cuttle. Not one o\u0027 them letters,\u0027 repeated the Captain, to make his declaration the more solemn and impressive, \u0027was ever delivered unto Ed\u0027ard Cuttle, Mariner, of England, as lives at home at ease, and doth improve each shining hour!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And posted by my own hand! And directed by my own hand, Number nine Brig Place!\u0027 exclaimed old Sol.\\n\\n The colour all went out of the Captain\u0027s face and all came back again in a glow.\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean, Sol Gills, my friend, by Number nine Brig Place?\u0027 inquired the Captain.\\n\\n \u0027Mean? Your lodgings, Ned,\u0027 returned the old man. \u0027Mrs What\u0027s-her-name! I shall forget my own name next, but I am behind the present time - I always was, you recollect - and very much confused. Mrs - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sol Gills!\u0027 said the Captain, as if he were putting the most improbable case in the world, \u0027it ain\u0027t the name of MacStinger as you\u0027re a trying to remember?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course it is!\u0027 exclaimed the Instrument-maker. \u0027To be sure Ned. Mrs MacStinger!\u0027\\n\\n Captain Cuttle, whose eyes were now as wide open as they would be, and the knobs upon whose face were perfectly luminous, gave a long shrill whistle of a most melancholy sound, and stood gazing at everybody in a state of speechlessness.\\n\\n \u0027Overhaul that there again, Sol Gills, will you be so kind?\u0027 he said at last.\\n\\n \u0027All these letters,\u0027 returned Uncle Sol, beating time with the forefinger of his right hand upon the palm of his left, with a steadiness and distinctness that might have done honour, even to the infallible chronometer in his pocket, \u0027I posted with my own hand, and directed with my own hand, to Captain Cuttle, at Mrs MacStinger\u0027s, Number nine Brig Place.\u0027\\n\\n The Captain took his glazed hat off his hook, looked into it, put it on, and sat down.\\n\\n \u0027Why, friends all,\u0027 said the Captain, staring round in the last state of discomfiture, \u0027I cut and run from there!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And no one knew where you were gone, Captain Cuttle?\u0027 cried Walter hastily.\\n\\n \u0027Bless your heart, Wal\u0027r,\u0027 said the Captain, shaking his head, \u0027she\u0027d never have allowed o\u0027 my coming to take charge o\u0027 this here property. Nothing could be done but cut and run. Lord love you, Wal\u0027r!\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027you\u0027ve only seen her in a calm! But see her when her angry passions rise - and make a note on!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d give it her!\u0027 remarked the Nipper, softly.\\n\\n \u0027Would you, do you think, my dear?\u0027 returned the Captain, with feeble admiration. \u0027Well, my dear, it does you credit. But there ain\u0027t no wild animal I wouldn\u0027t sooner face myself. I only got my chest away by means of a friend as nobody\u0027s a match for. It was no good sending any letter there. She wouldn\u0027t take in any letter, bless you,\u0027 said the Captain, \u0027under them circumstances! Why, you could hardly make it worth a man\u0027s while to be the postman!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then it\u0027s pretty clear, Captain Cuttle, that all of us, and you and Uncle Sol especially,\u0027 said Walter, \u0027may thank Mrs MacStinger for no small anxiety.\u0027\\n\\n The general obligation in this wise to the determined relict of the late Mr MacStinger, was so apparent, that the Captain did not contest the point; but being in some measure ashamed of his position, though nobody dwelt upon the subject, and Walter especially avoided it, remembering the last conversation he and the Captain had held together respecting it, he remained under a cloud for nearly five minutes - an extraordinary period for him when that sun, his face, broke out once more, shining on all beholders with extraordinary brilliancy; and he fell into a fit of shaking hands with everybody over and over again.\\n\\n At an early hour, but not before Uncle Sol and Walter had questioned each other at some length about their voyages and dangers, they all, except Walter, vacated Florence\u0027s room, and went down to the parlour. Here they were soon afterwards joined by Walter, who told them Florence was a little sorrowful and heavy-hearted, and had gone to bed. Though they could not have disturbed her with their voices down there, they all spoke in a whisper after this: and each, in his different way, felt very lovingly and gently towards Walter\u0027s fair young bride: and a long explanation there was of everything relating to her, for the satisfaction of Uncle Sol; and very sensible Mr Toots was of the delicacy with which Walter made his name and services important, and his presence necessary to their little council.\\n\\n \u0027Mr Toots,\u0027 said Walter, on parting with him at the house door, \u0027we shall see each other to-morrow morning?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lieutenant Walters,\u0027 returned Mr Toots, grasping his hand fervently, \u0027I shall certainly be present.\\n\\n \u0027This is the last night we shall meet for a long time - the last night we may ever meet,\u0027 said Walter. \u0027Such a noble heart as yours, must feel, I think, when another heart is bound to it. I hope you know that I am very grateful to you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Walters,\u0027 replied Mr Toots, quite touched, \u0027I should be glad to feel that you had reason to be so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Florence,\u0027 said Walter, \u0027on this last night of her bearing her own name, has made me promise - it was only just now, when you left us together - that I would tell you - with her dear love - \u0027\\n\\n Mr Toots laid his hand upon the doorpost, and his eyes upon his hand.\\n\\n - with her dear love,\u0027 said Walter, \u0027that she can never have a friend whom she will value above you. That the recollection of your true consideration for her always, can never be forgotten by her. That she remembers you in her prayers to-night, and hopes that you will think of her when she is far away. Shall I say anything for you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Say, Walter,\u0027 replied Mr Toots indistinctly, \u0027that I shall think of her every day, but never without feeling happy to know that she is married to the man she loves, and who loves her. Say, if you please, that I am sure her husband deserves her - even her!- and that I am glad of her choice.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Toots got more distinct as he came to these last words, and raising his eyes from the doorpost, said them stoutly. He then shook Walter\u0027s hand again with a fervour that Walter was not slow to return and started homeward.\\n\\n Mr Toots was accompanied by the Chicken, whom he had of late brought with him every evening, and left in the shop, with an idea that unforeseen circumstances might arise from without, in which the prowess of that distinguished character would be of service to the Midshipman. The Chicken did not appear to be in a particularly good humour on this occasion. Either the gas-lamps were treacherous, or he cocked his eye in a hideous manner, and likewise distorted his nose, when Mr Toots, crossing the road, looked back over his shoulder at the room where Florence slept. On the road home, he was more demonstrative of aggressive intentions against the other foot-passengers, than comported with a professor of the peaceful art of self-defence. Arrived at home, instead of leaving Mr Toots in his apartments when he had escorted him thither, he remained before him weighing his white hat in both hands by the brim, and twitching his head and nose (both of which had been many times broken, and but indifferently repaired), with an air of decided disrespect.\\n\\n His patron being much engaged with his own thoughts, did not observe this for some time, nor indeed until the Chicken, determined not to be overlooked, had made divers clicking sounds with his tongue and teeth, to attract attention.\\n\\n \u0027Now, Master,\u0027 said the Chicken, doggedly, when he, at length, caught Mr Toots\u0027s eye, \u0027I want to know whether this here gammon is to finish it, or whether you\u0027re a going in to win?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Chicken,\u0027 returned Mr Toots, \u0027explain yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why then, here\u0027s all about it, Master,\u0027 said the Chicken. \u0027I ain\u0027t a cove to chuck a word away. Here\u0027s wot it is. Are any on \u0027em to be doubled up?\u0027\\n\\n When the Chicken put this question he dropped his hat, made a dodge and a feint with his left hand, hit a supposed enemy a violent blow with his right, shook his head smartly, and recovered himself\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come, Master,\u0027 said the Chicken. \u0027Is it to be gammon or pluck? Which?\u0027\\n\\n Chicken,\u0027 returned Mr Toots, \u0027your expressions are coarse, and your meaning is obscure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why, then, I tell you what, Master,\u0027 said the Chicken. \u0027This is where it is. It\u0027s mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is mean, Chicken?\u0027 asked Mr Toots.\\n\\n \u0027It is,\u0027 said the Chicken, with a frightful corrugation of his broken nose. \u0027There! Now, Master! Wot! When you could go and blow on this here match to the stiff\u0027un;\u0027 by which depreciatory appellation it has been since supposed that the Game One intended to signify Mr Dombey; \u0027and when you could knock the winner and all the kit of \u0027em dead out o\u0027 wind and time, are you going to give in? To give in? \u0027said the Chicken, with contemptuous emphasis. \u0027Wy, it\u0027s mean!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Chicken,\u0027 said Mr Toots, severely, \u0027you\u0027re a perfect Vulture! Your sentiments are atrocious.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My sentiments is Game and Fancy, Master,\u0027 returned the Chicken. \u0027That\u0027s wot my sentiments is. I can\u0027t abear a meanness. I\u0027m afore the public, I\u0027m to be heerd on at the bar of the Little Helephant, and no Gov\u0027ner o\u0027 mine mustn\u0027t go and do what\u0027s mean. Wy, it\u0027s mean,\u0027 said the Chicken, with increased expression. \u0027That\u0027s where it is. It\u0027s mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Chicken,\u0027 said Mr Toots, \u0027you disgust me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Master,\u0027 returned the Chicken, putting on his hat, \u0027there\u0027s a pair on us, then. Come! Here\u0027s a offer! You\u0027ve spoke to me more than once\u0027t or twice\u0027t about the public line. Never mind! Give me a fi\u0027typunnote to-morrow, and let me go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Chicken,\u0027 returned Mr Toots, \u0027after the odious sentiments you have expressed, I shall be glad to part on such terms.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Done then,\u0027 said the Chicken. \u0027It\u0027s a bargain. This here conduct of yourn won\u0027t suit my book, Master. Wy, it\u0027s mean,\u0027 said the Chicken; who seemed equally unable to get beyond that point, and to stop short of it. \u0027That\u0027s where it is; it\u0027s mean!\u0027\\n\\n So Mr Toots and the Chicken agreed to part on this incompatibility of moral perception; and Mr Toots lying down to sleep, dreamed happily of Florence, who had thought of him as her friend upon the last night of her maiden life, and who had sent him her dear love.\\n\\n 海军军官候补生精神抖擞。图茨先生和苏珊终于来了。苏珊像一个发疯的姑娘一样跑到楼上，图茨先生和斗鸡则走进客厅。\\n\\n “啊，我亲爱的心肝宝贝可爱的弗洛伊小姐！”尼珀跑进弗洛伊的房间，喊道，“想不到事情会到了这个地步，我竟会在这里找到您呀我亲爱的小鸽子，您在这里没有人侍候您也没有一个您可以称为自己的家，不过我永远永远也不会再离开您了，弗洛伊小姐，因为我虽然不会长苔藓，但我不是一块滚动的石头，①我的心也不是一块石头要不然它就不会像现在这样在爆裂了，啊亲爱的啊亲爱的！”\\n\\n --------\\n\\n ①滚动的石头不长苔藓（Arollingstonegathersnomoss），是英国谚语。滚动的石头一般比喻喜欢改换职业、住址等的人。\\n\\n 尼珀姑娘滔滔不绝地倾吐出这些话语，并跪在她的女主人的前面，紧紧地拥抱着她。\\n\\n “我亲爱的！”苏珊喊道，“过去发生的事情我全知道了，我一切都知道了，我心爱的宝贝，我喘不过气来了，给我空气吧！”\\n\\n “苏珊，亲爱的好苏珊！”弗洛伦斯说道。\\n\\n “啊上帝保佑她！她还是个小孩子的时候我就是她的小侍女！难道她确确实实当真要结婚了吗？”苏珊高声喊道，她又是痛苦又是高兴，又是自豪又是悲伤，天知道还夹杂着多少其他相互冲突的感情。\\n\\n “谁跟您这么说的？”弗洛伦斯说道。\\n\\n “啊我的天哪！就是那个最傻里傻气的人图茨，”苏珊歇斯底里地回答道，“我知道他准没错，我亲爱的，因为他很伤心。他是个最忠实最傻里傻气的小娃娃！难道我心爱的人儿确确实实要结婚了吗？”苏珊继续说道，一边泪流满脸地又紧紧拥抱着她。\\n\\n 尼珀不断地提到这个问题，每当提到这个问题的时候，她都要抬起头来注视这张年轻的脸孔并吻它，然后又把头低垂在女主人肩膀上，爱抚着她，并哭泣着；她提到这个问题时所流露出来的、混杂着同情、喜悦、亲切与爱护的感情是世界上真正女性的高尚的感情。\\n\\n “好了，好了！”弗洛伦斯不久用安慰的声调说道，“啊现在您镇静下来了，亲爱的苏珊！”\\n\\n 尼珀姑娘坐在女主人脚边的地板上，又是大笑又是哭泣，一只手用手绢抹着眼泪，另一只手轻轻地拍着正舔她的脸孔的戴奥吉尼斯；她承认她现在镇静一些了，为了证明这一点，她又大笑了一会儿，哭泣了一会儿。\\n\\n “我——我——我从来没有见过像图茨这样的人，”苏珊说道，“从我生下来起从来没有见过！”\\n\\n “他是那么善良，”弗洛伦斯提示道。\\n\\n “而且是那么滑稽可笑！”苏珊抽抽嗒嗒地哭泣着说道，“他跟我坐在马车里跟我谈话，那位不值得尊敬的斗鸡则坐在车夫座位上，那时候瞧他那说话的神态和腔调！”\\n\\n “他谈了些什么呢；苏珊？”弗洛伦斯胆怯地问道。\\n\\n “他谈到沃尔特斯上尉，谈到吉尔斯船长，还谈到您我亲爱的弗洛伊小姐，还有那沉默的坟墓，”苏珊说道。\\n\\n “沉默的坟墓！”弗洛伦斯重复地说道。\\n\\n “他说，”这时苏珊歇斯底里地大笑了一阵子，“他将立刻很轻松自在地走进沉默的坟墓，可是您放心他不会的，我亲爱的弗洛伊小姐，他说那句话是表示他看到别人幸福真是太快乐了，他也许并不是所罗门，”尼珀姑娘又像往常那样滔滔不绝地继续说道，“我也没有说他就是所罗门，但是我敢说世界上从来没有见到过像他那样不自私的人！”\\n\\n 尼珀姑娘作了这个有力的声明之后，仍然处于歇斯底里的状态，毫无节制地大笑着，然后才告诉弗洛伦斯，他在楼下等着见她，这将是对他最近不辞辛苦、长途奔波的极为丰厚的酬答。\\n\\n 弗洛伦斯请苏珊去邀请图茨先生上楼来，她将高兴地对他的好意帮助表示感谢。几分钟之后，苏珊就把那位年轻人带进房间，他头发还是乱蓬蓬的，说起话来结巴得厉害。\\n\\n “董贝小姐，”图茨先生说道，“又承蒙您允许我——注视——至少，不是注视，不过——我不知道我要说什么，不过这是无关紧要的。”\\n\\n “我是这么经常地感谢您，我都已经把话讲完了，因此我不知道现在该讲些什么好。”弗洛伦斯向他伸出双手，脸上露出真挚的谢意。\\n\\n “董贝小姐，”图茨先生用可怕的说道，“如果您能够咒骂我几句（这并不改变您那天使般的性格），那么我反倒好受些；现在您讲了这样亲切的话，可真把我难住了（如果您允许我这样说的话）。这些话对我的影响——是——不过，”图茨先生突然中断话头，说道，“我离题了，这完全是无关紧要的。”\\n\\n 弗洛伦斯由于除了再次谢谢他之外，似乎没办法回答他的话，所以就再一次谢谢他。\\n\\n “董贝小姐，”图茨先生说道，“如果可能的话，我希望趁这个机会解释一、两句。我本可以和苏珊早一些回来的，可是第一，我们不知道她投奔的亲戚的姓名，第二，因为她已离开了她那位亲戚的家，到另一位住在远处的亲戚那里去了，所以我想，如果不是斗鸡聪明的话，那么我们到现在也还不见得就能找到她呢。”\\n\\n 弗洛伦斯相信这一点。\\n\\n “不过，这并不是重要的一点，”图茨先生说道，“我可以向您肯定地说，董贝小姐，就我当时的心情来说（它是容易想象而难以描述的），跟苏珊在一起对我是一种安慰与满足。这次旅行本身就是一种报酬。可是那仍然不是重要的一点。董贝小姐，我曾经跟您说过，我明白，我并不是个人们可以称做头脑灵敏的人。我完全知道这一点。我自己比任何人都清楚，我是个多么——如果不算说得太过分的话，那么我就要说，我是个脑子很愚钝的人。可是尽管这样，董贝小姐，我还是看出沃尔特斯上尉的情况是怎么回事。不论这种情况会使我产生多少痛苦（这是完全无关紧要的），可是我一定得说，沃尔特斯上尉看来是个值得享受降临在他的——他的身上的幸福的人。祝愿他长久地享受它，并珍惜它，就像一个很不相同、很不足取、指出他的姓名完全是无关紧要的人会珍惜它的一样！不过，这仍然不是重要的一点。董贝小姐，吉尔斯船长是我的朋友，我觉得如果在这段时间里我不时来回到这里来看看，吉尔斯船长是会感到高兴的。到这里来看看也会使我感到高兴。不过我不能忘记，我有一次在布赖顿广场角落里犯了一个极严重的错误；如果我到这里来会使您有一点点不乐意的话，那么我只请求您现在就向我指出来；我可以向您保证，我将完全理解您。我决不会认为这是冷酷无情，而只会由于荣幸地得到您的信任而感到快乐和幸福。”\\n\\n “图茨先生，”弗洛伦斯回答道，“您是我的一位很真诚的老朋友；如果您现在不再到这里来看我们的话，那么您将会使我感到很不快乐。我看到您只会感到高兴，而决不会产生任何其他的感情。”“董贝小姐，”图茨先生掏出手绢来，说道，“如果我掉眼泪的话，那么这是欢乐的眼泪；这是无关紧要的；我深深地感谢您。在您讲了这些亲切的话以后，请允许我说一句，我不打算再轻视我自己了。”\\n\\n 弗洛伦斯听到这个暗示，露出了茫然不解的可爱的表情。\\n\\n “我的意思是说，”图茨先生说道，“我将认为，在我没有被沉默的坟墓召唤去之前，作为人类的一员，我有责任尽量让我的外表好看一些；如果——如果情况允许的话，那么我将——把我的靴子擦得亮亮的。董贝小姐，这是我最后一次冒昧地向您讲到有关个人方面的事。我确实非常感谢您。如果我不是像我的朋友们或我自己所希望的那样明白事理的话，那么，说实话，我以我的荣誉发誓，我对别人的体贴与好意是特别能领会的。如果——如果——我知道怎样开始的话，图茨先生用充满热情的语气说道，“我觉得仿佛我现在能以最美好的方式来表达我的感情似的。”\\n\\n 图茨先生等了一、两分钟，看看他是否能想出怎样开始；看来他还是想不出来，就匆匆告辞了。他走下楼去找船长，在店铺里找到了他。\\n\\n “吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生说道，“我现在跟您谈的事情必须保证严守秘密，吉尔斯船长；这是我跟董贝小姐在楼上谈话的结果。”\\n\\n “在船内和在桅杆高处是吗，我的孩子？”船长低声问道。\\n\\n “正是这样，吉尔斯船长，”图茨先生说道，他由于完全不明白船长讲话的意思，就以极大的热情表示同意。“吉尔斯船长，我相信董贝小姐很快就要跟沃尔特斯上尉结婚了吧？”\\n\\n “是的，是的，我的孩子。我们这里全都是船友。沃尔跟他亲爱的情人在结婚预告①结束之后，就立即在缔结婚姻的房屋里结为夫妇了，”卡特尔船长凑着他的耳朵低声说道。\\n\\n --------\\n\\n ①在信奉基督教的国家，人们在结婚之前，在教堂中须宣读结婚预告，询问是否有人提出异议；在不同时间，共宣读三次预告。\\n\\n “结婚预告，吉尔斯船长！”图茨先生重复说道。\\n\\n “在那边教堂里，”船长用大姆指指指肩膀后面，说道。\\n\\n “啊，是的！”图茨先生回答道。\\n\\n “然后怎样呢？”船长用手背拍拍图茨先生的胸膛，往后退了一步，露出钦佩的神情看着他，并用嘶哑的低声说道，“然\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/329/8560.html","bookId":133,"book":{"id":133,"title":"董贝父子 Dombey and Son","description":"简介： 《董贝父子》是狄更斯最重要的作品之一，发表于1848年。小说描写了董贝父子公司的盛衰史。董贝是个贪得无厌的大资本家，妻子儿女都成了他追逐利润的工 具和摆设。公司经理卡克尔是个奸诈小人，骗取了董贝的信任后又一手造成了他的破产。在现实的教训中，董贝的思想发生...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110628/1-11062Q42IH62.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/329","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
