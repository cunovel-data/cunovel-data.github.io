{"id":97329,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"This is madness, she thought.\\n\\n But the God Emperor had reinforced his command. He required his Nayla to obey Siona in all things.\\n\\n Siona\u0027s orders were explicit, leaving no way for evasions. And Nayla had no way here to query her God Emperor. Siona had said: \"When his cart is in the middle of the bridge-then!\"\\n\\n \"But why?\"\\n\\n They had been standing well away from the others in the chill dawn atop the Barrier Wall, Nayla feeling precariously isolated here, remote and vulnerable.\\n\\n Siona\u0027s grim features, her low, intense voice, could not be denied. \"Do you think you can harm God?\"\\n\\n \"I...\" Nayla could only shrug.\\n\\n \"You must obey me!\"\\n\\n \"I must,\" Nayla agreed.\\n\\n Nayla studied the approach of the distant cortege, noting the colors of the courtiers, the thick masses of blue marking her sisters of the Fish Speakers... the shiny surface of her Lord\u0027s cart.\\n\\n It was another test, she decided. The God Emperor would know. He would know the devotion in His Nayla\u0027s heart. It was a test. The God Emperor\u0027s commands must be obeyed in all things. That was the earliest lesson of her Fish Speaker childhood. The God Emperor had said that Nayla must obey Siona. It was a test. What else could it be?\\n\\n She looked toward the four Fremen. They had been positioned by Duncan Idaho directly in the roadway and blocking part of the exit from this end of the bridge. They sat with their backs to her and looked out across the bridge, four brown-robed mounds. Nayla had heard Idaho\u0027s words to them.\\n\\n \"Do not leave this place. You must greet him from here. Stand when he nears you and bow low.\"\\n\\n Greet, yes.\\n\\n Nayla nodded to herself.\\n\\n The three other Fish Speakers who had climbed the Barrier Wall with her had been sent to the center of the bridge. All they knew was what Siona had told them in Nayla\u0027s presence. They were to wait until the Royal Cart was only a few paces from them, then they were to turn and dance away from the cart, leading it and the procession toward the vantage point above Tuono.\\n\\n If I cut the bridge with my lasgun, those three will die, Nayla thought. And all the others who come with our Lord.\\n\\n Nayla craned her neck to peer down into the gorge. She could not see the river from here, but she could hear its distant rumblings, a movement of rocks.\\n\\n They would all die!\\n\\n Unless He performs a Miracle.\\n\\n That had to be it. Siona had set the stage for a Holy Miracle. What else could Siona intend now that she had been tested, now that she wore the uniform of Fish Speaker Command? Siona had given her oath to the God Emperor. She had been tested by God, the two of them alone in the Sareer.\\n\\n Nayla turned only her eyes to the right, peering at the architects of this greeting. Siona and Idaho stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the roadway about twenty meters to Nayla\u0027s right. They were deep in conversation, looking at each other occasionally, nodding.\\n\\n Presently, Idaho touched Siona\u0027s arm-an oddly possessive\\n\\n gesture. He nodded once and strode off toward the bridge, stopping at the buttress corner directly in front of Nayla. He peered down, then crossed to the other near corner of the bridge.\\n\\n Again, he peered downward, standing there for several minutes before returning to Siona.\\n\\n What a strange creature, that ghola, Nayla thought. After that awesome climb, she no longer thought of him as quite human. He was something else, a demiurge who stood next to God. But he could breed.\\n\\n A distant shout caught Nayla\u0027s attention. She turned and looked across the bridge. The cortege had been in the familiar trot of a royal peregrination. Now, they were slowing to a sedate walk only a few minutes away from the bridge. Nayla recognized Moneo marching in the van, his uniform brilliant white, the even, undeviating stride with his gaze straight ahead. The cover of the Emperor\u0027s cart had been sealed. It glittered in mirror-opacity as it rolled behind Moneo on its wheels.\\n\\n The mystery of it all filled Nayla.\\n\\n A miracle was about to happen!\\n\\n Nayla glanced to the right at Siona. Siona returned her gaze and nodded once. Nayla drew the lasgun from its holster and rested it against the rock pillar as she sighted along it. The cable on the left first, then the cable on the right, then the faery trellis of plasteel on the left. The lasgun felt cold and alien against Nayla\u0027s hand. She took a trembling breath to restore calm. must obey. It is a test.\\n\\n She saw Moneo lift his gaze from the roadway and, not changing stride, turn to shout something at the cart or the ones behind it. Nayla could not make out the words. Moneo faced front once more. Nayla steadied herself, a part of the rock pillar which concealed most of her body.\\n\\n A test.\\n\\n Moneo had seen the people on the bridge and at the far end. He identified Fish Speaker uniforms and his first thought was to wonder who had ordered these greeters. He turned and shouted a question at Leto, but the God Emperor\u0027s cart cover remained opaque, hiding Hwi and Leto within it.\\n\\n Moneo was onto the bridge, the cart rasping in blown sand behind him, before he recognized Siona and Idaho standing well back from the far end. He identified four Museum Fremen seated on the roadway. Doubts began squirming through Moneo\u0027s mind, but he could not change the pattern. He ventured a glance down at the river-a platinum world there caught in the noonday light. The sound of the cart was loud behind him. The flow of the river, the flow of the cortege, the sweeping importance of these things in which he played a role-all of it caught up his mind in a dizzying sensation of the inevitable.\\n\\n We are not people passing this way, he thought. We are primal elements linking one piece of Time to another. And when we have passed, everything behind us will drop off into no-sound, a place like the no-room of the lxians, yet never again the same as it was before we came.\\n\\n A bit from one of the lute-player\u0027s songs wafted through Moneo\u0027s memory and his eyes went out of focus in the remembrance. He knew that song for its wishfulness, a wish that all of this were ended, all past, all doubts banished, tranquility returned. The plaintive song drifted through his awareness like smoke, twisting and compelling:\\n\\n \"Insect cries in roots of pampas grass.\" \"\\n\\n Moneo hummed the song to himself:\\n\\n \"Insect cries mark the end. Autumn and my song are the color Of the last leaves In roots of pampas grass.\"\\n\\n Moneo nodded his head to the refrain:\\n\\n \"Day is ended, Visitors gone. Day is ended. In our Sietch, Day is ended. Storm wind sounds. Day is ended. Visitors gone.\"\\n\\n Moneo decided that the lute-player\u0027s song had to be a really old one, an Old Fremen song, no doubt of it. And it told him something about himself. He wished the visitors truly gone, the excitements ended, peace once more. Peace was so near... yet he could not leave his duties. He thought of all that impedimenta piled out there on the sand just beyond visibility range from Tuono. They would see it all soon-tents, food, tables, golden plates and jeweled knives, glowglobes fashioned in the arabesque shapes of ancient lamps... everything rich and full of expectations from completely different lives.\\n\\n They will never be the same in Tuono.\\n\\n Moneo had spent two nights in Tuono once on an inspection tour. He remembered the smells of their cooking fires-aromatic bushes kindled and flaming in the dark. They would not use sunstoves because \"that is not the most ancient way.\"\\n\\n Most ancient!\\n\\n There was little smell of melange in Tuono. A sweet acridity and the musky oils of oasis shrubs, these dominated the odors. Yes... and the cesspools and the stink of rotting garbage. He recalled the God Emperor\u0027s comment when Moneo had finished reporting on that tour.\\n\\n \"These Fremen do not know what is lost from their lives. They think they keep the essence of the old ways. This is a failure of all museums. Something fades; it dries out of the exhibits and is gone. The people who administer the museum and the people who come to bend over the cases and stare few of them sense this missing thing. It drove the engine of life in earlier times. When the life is gone, it is gone.\"\\n\\n Moneo focused on the three Fish Speakers who stood just ahead of him on the bridge. They lifted their arms high and began to dance, whirling and skipping away from him only a few paces distant.\\n\\n How odd, he thought. I\u0027ve seen the other people dance in the open, but never Fish Speakers. They only dance in the privacy of their quarters, in the intimacy of their own company.\\n\\n This thought was still in his mind when he heard the first awful humming of the lasgun and felt the bridge lurch beneath him.\\n\\n This is not happening, his mind told him.\\n\\n He heard the Royal Cart scrape sideways across the roadbed, then the snap-slap of the cart\u0027s cover slamming open. A bedlam of screams and cries arose from behind him, but he could not turn. The bridge\u0027s roadbed had tipped steeply to Moneo\u0027s right, spilling him onto his face while he went sliding toward the abyss. He clutched a severed strand of cable to stop himself. The cable went with him, everything grating in the spilling film of sand which had covered the roadbed. He clutched the cable with both hands, turning with it. He saw the Royal Cart then. It skewed sideways toward the edge of the bridge, its cover open. Hwi stood there, one hand steadying her on the folding seat while she stared past Moneo.\\n\\n A horrible screaming of metal filled the air as the roadbed tipped even farther. He saw people from the cortege falling, their mouths open, arms waving. Something had caught Moneo\u0027s cable. His arms were stretched out over his head as he turned once more, twisting. He felt his hands, greased by the perspiration of fear, slipping along the cable.\\n\\n Once more, his gaze came around to the Royal Cart. It lay jammed against the stubs of broken girders. Even as Moneo looked, the God Emperor\u0027s futile hands groped for Hwi Noree, but failed to reach her. She fell from the cart\u0027s open end, silently, the golden gown whipping upward to reveal her body stretched out as straight as an arrow.\\n\\n A deep, rumbling groan came from the God Emperor.\\n\\n Why doesn\u0027t he activate the suspensors? Moneo wondered. The suspensors will support him.\\n\\n But the lasgun was still humming and, as Moneo\u0027s hands slipped from the cable\u0027s severed end, he saw lancing flame strike the cart\u0027s suspensor bubbles, piercing one after another in eruptions of golden smoke. Moneo stretched his hands over his head as he fell.\\n\\n The smoke! The golden smoke!\\n\\n His robe whipped upward, turning him until his face was directed downward into the abyss. With his gaze on the depths, he recognized a maelstrom of boiling rapids there, the mirror of his life-precipitous currents and plunges, all movement gathering up all substance. Leto\u0027s words wound through his mind on a path of golden smoke: \"Caution is the path to mediocrity. Gliding, passionless mediocrity is all that most people think they can achieve.\" Moneo fell freely then in the ecstasy of awareness. The universe opened for him like clear glass, everything flowing in a no Time.\\n\\n The golden smoke!\\n\\n \"Leto!\" he screamed. \"Siaynoq! I believe!\"\\n\\n The robe tore away from his shoulders then. He turned in the wind of the canyon-one last glimpse of the Royal Cart tipping... tipping from the shattered roadbed. The God Emperor slid out of the open end.\\n\\n Something solid smashed into Moneo\u0027s back-his last sensation.\\n\\n Leto felt himself sliding from the cart. His awareness held only the image of Hwi striking the river-the distant pearly fountain which marked her plunge into the myths and dreams of termination. Her last words, calm and steady, rolled through all of his memories: \"I shall go on ahead, Love.\"\\n\\n As- he slipped from the cart, he saw the scimitar arc of the river, a sliver-edged thing which shimmered in its mottled shadows, a vicious blade of a river honed through Eternity and ready now to receive him into its agony.\\n\\n I cannot cry, nor even shout, he thought. Tears are no longer possible. They\u0027re water. I\u0027ll have water enough in a moment. I can only moan in my grief. I am alone, more alone than ever before.\\n\\n His great ridged body flexed as it fell, twisting him about until his amplified vision revealed Siona standing at the broken brink of the bridge.\\n\\n Now, you will learn! he thought.\\n\\n The body continued to turn. He watched the river approach. The water was a dream inhabited by glimpses of fish which ignited an ancient memory of a banquet beside a granite pool- pink flesh dazzling his hungers.\\n\\n I join you, Hwi, in the banquet of the gods!\\n\\n A bursting flash of bubbles enclosed him in agony. Water, vicious currents of it, buffeted him all around. He felt the gnashing of rocks as he struggled upward to broach in a torrential cascade, his body flexing in a paroxysm of involuntary, writhing splashes. The canyon Wall, wet and black, sped past his frantic gaze. Shattered spangles of what had been his skin exploded away from him, a rain of silver all around him darting away into the river, a ring of dazzling movement, brittle sequins-the scale-glitter of sandtrout leaving him to begin their own colony lives.\\n\\n The agony continued. Leto marveled that he could remain conscious, that he had a body to feel.\\n\\n Instinct drove him. He clutched at a rock around which the torrent spilled him, felt a clutching finger torn from his hand before he could release his grip. The sensation of it was only a minor accent in the symphony of pain.\\n\\n The river\u0027s course swept to the left around a chasm buttress and, as though saying it had enough of him, it sent him rolling onto the sloping edge of a sandbar. He lay there a moment, the blue dye of spice-essence drifting away from him in the current. The agony moved him, the worm body moving of itself, retreating from the water. All the covering sandtrout were gone and he felt every touch more immediate, a lost sense restored when all it could bring him was pain. He could not see his body, but he felt the thing that would have been a worm as it made its writhing, crawling progress out of the water. He peered upward through eyes that saw everything in sheets of flame from which shapes coalesced of their own accord. At last, he recognized this place. The river had swept him to the turn where it left the Sareer forever. Behind him lay Tuono and, just a ways down the barrier Wall, was all that remained of Sietch Tabr-Stilgar\u0027s realm, the place where all of Leto\u0027s spice had been concealed.\\n\\n Exhuding blue fumes, his agonized body writhed its way noisily along a shingle of beach, dragged its blue-dyed way across broken boulders and into a damp hole which might have been part of the original sietch. It was only a shallow cave now, blocked at its inner end by a rock fall. His nostrils reported the wet dirt smell and clean spice essence.\\n\\n Sounds intruded on his agony. He turned in the confinement of the cave and saw a rope dangling at the entrance. A figure slid down the rope. He recognized Nayla. She dropped to the rocks and crouched there, staring into the shadows at him. The flame which was Leto\u0027s vision parted to reveal another figure dropping from the rope: Siona. She and Nayla scrambled toward him in a rattle of rocks and stopped, peering in at him. A third figure dropped off the rope: Idaho. He moved with frantic rage, hurling himself at Nayla, screaming:\\n\\n \"Why did you kill her! You weren\u0027t supposed to kill Hwi!\"\\n\\n Nayla sent him sprawling with a casual, almost indifferent sweep of her left arm. She scrambled closer up the rocks and stopped on all fours to peer in at Leto.\\n\\n \"Lord? You live?\"\\n\\n Idaho was right behind her, snatching the lasgun from her holster. Nayla turned, astonished, as he leveled the weapon and pulled its trigger. The burning started at the top of Nayla\u0027s head. It split her, the pieces slumping apart. A shining crysknife spilled from her burning uniform and shattered on the rocks. Idaho did not see it. A grimace of rage on his face, he kept burning and burning the pieces of Nayla until the weapon\u0027s charge was gone. The blazing arc vanished. Only wet and smoking bits of meat and cloth lay scattered among the glowing rocks.\\n\\n It was the moment for which Siona had waited. She scrambled up to him and pulled the useless lasgun from Idaho\u0027s hands. He whirled toward her and she poised herself-to subdue him, but all the rage was gone.\\n\\n \"Why?\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s done,\" she said.\\n\\n They turned and looked into the cave shadows at Leto.\\n\\n Leto could not even imagine what they saw. The sandtrout skin was gone, he knew. There would be some kind of surface pocked with cilia holes from the departed skin. As for the rest, he could only look back at the two figures from a universe furrowed by sorrow. Through the vision flames he saw Siona as a female demon. The demon name came unbidden to his minds and he spoke it aloud, amplified by the cave and much louder than he had expected:\\n\\n \"Hanmya!\"\\n\\n \"What?\" She moved a step closer to him.\\n\\n Idaho put both harass over his face.\\n\\n \"Look at what you\u0027ve done to poor Duncan,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll find other loves.\" How callous she sounded, an echo of his own angry youth.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know what it is to love,\" he said. \"What have you ever given?\" He could only wring his hands then those travesties which once had been his hands. \"Gods below! What I\u0027ve given!\"\\n\\n She sled closer and reached toward him, then drew back.\\n\\n \"I am reality, Siona. Look upon me. I exist. You can touch me if you dare. Reach out your hand. Do it!\"\\n\\n Slowly, she reached toward what had been his front segment, the place where she had slept in the Sareer. Her hand was touched with blue when she withdrew it.\\n\\n \"You have touched me and felt my body,\" he said. \"Is that not strange beyond any other thing in this universe?\"\\n\\n She started to turn away.\\n\\n \"No! Don\u0027t turn away from me! Look at what you have wrought, Siona. How is it that you can touch me but you cannot touch yourself?\"\\n\\n She whirled away from him.\\n\\n \"There is the difference between us,\" he said. \"You are God embodied. You walk around within the greatest miracle of this universe, yet you refuse to touch or see or feel or believe in it.\"\\n\\n Leto\u0027s awareness went wandering then into a night-encircled place, a place where he thought he could hear the metal insect song of his hidden printers clacking away in their lightless room. There was a complete absence of radiation in this place, an Ixian no-thing which made it a place of anxiety and spiritual alienation because it had no connection with the rest of the universe.\\n\\n But it will have a connection.\\n\\n He sensed then that his Ixian printers had been set in motion, that they were recording his thoughts without any special command.\\n\\n Remember what I did! Remember me! I will be innocent again!\\n\\n The flame of his vision parted to reveal Idaho standing where Siona had stood. There was gesturing motion somewhere out of focus behind Idaho... ah, yes: Siona waving instructions to someone atop the barrier Wall.\\n\\n \"Are you still alive?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n Leto\u0027s voice came in wheezing gasps: \"Let them scatter, Duncan. Let them run and hide anywhere they want in any universe they choose.\"\\n\\n \"Damn you! What\u0027re you saying? I\u0027d have sooner let her live with you!\"\\n\\n \"Let? I did not let anything.\"\\n\\n \"Why did you let Hwi die?\" Idaho moaned. \"We didn\u0027t know she was in there with you.\"\\n\\n Idaho\u0027s head sagged forward.\\n\\n \"You will be recompensed,\" Leto husked. \"My Fish Speakers will choose you over Siona. Be kind to her, Duncan. She is more than Atreides and she carries the seed of your survival.\"\\n\\n Leto sank back into his memories. They were delicate myths now, held fleetingly in his awareness. He sensed that he might have fallen into a time which, by its very being, had changed the past. There were sounds, though, and he struggled to interpret them. Someone scrambling on rocks? The flames parted to reveal Siona standing beside Idaho. They stood hand-in-hand like two children reassuring each other before venturing into an unknown place.\\n\\n \"How can he live like that?\" Siona whispered.\\n\\n Leto waited for the strength to respond. \"Hwi helps me,\" he said. \"We had something few experience. We were joined in our strengths rather than in our weaknesses.\"\\n\\n \"And look what it got you!\" Siona sneered.\\n\\n \"Yes, and pray that you get the same,\" he husked. \"Perhaps the spice will give you time.\"\\n\\n \"Where is your spice?\" she demanded.\\n\\n \"Deep in Sietch Tabr,\" he said. \"Duncan will find it. You know the place, Duncan. They call it Tabur now. The outlines are still there.\"\\n\\n \"Why did you do it?\" Idaho whispered.\\n\\n \"My gift,\" Leto said. \"Nobody will find the descendants of Siona. The Oracle cannot see her.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" They spoke in unison, leaning close to hear his fading voice.\\n\\n \"I give you a new kind of time without parallels,\" he said. \"It will always diverge. There will be no concurrent points on its curves. I give you the Golden Path. That is my gift. Never again will you have the kinds of concurrence that once you had.\"\\n\\n Flames covered his vision. The agony was fading, but he could still sense odors and hear sounds with a terrible acuity. Both Idaho and Siona were breathing in quick, shallow gasps. Odd kinesthetic sensations began to weave their way through Leto-echoes of bones and joints which he knew he no longer possessed.\\n\\n \"Look!\" Siona said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s disintegrating.\" That was Idaho.\\n\\n \"No.\" Siona. \"The outside is falling away. Look! The Worm!\"\\n\\n Leto felt parts of himself settling into warm softness. The agony removed itself.\\n\\n \"What\u0027re those holes in him?\" Siona.\\n\\n \"I think they were the sandtrout. See the shapes?\"\\n\\n \"I am here to prove one of my ancestors wrong,\" Leto said\\n\\n (or thought he said, which was the same thing as far as his journals were concerned). \"I was born a man but I do not die a man.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t look!\" Siona said.\\n\\n Leto heard her turn away, a rattle of rocks.\\n\\n \"Are you still there, Duncan?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n So I still have a voice.\\n\\n \"Look at me,\" Leto said. \"I was a bloody bit of pulp in a human womb, a bit no larger than a cherry. Look at me, I say!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m looking.\" Idaho\u0027s voice was faint.\\n\\n \"You expected a giant and you found a gnome,\" Leto said. \"Now, you\u0027re beginning to know the responsibilities which come as a result of actions. What will you do with your new power, Duncan?\"\\n\\n There was a long silence, then Siona\u0027s voice: \"Don\u0027t listen to him! He was mad!\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Leto said. \"Madness in method, that is genius.\"\\n\\n \"Siona, do you understand this?\" Idaho asked. How plaintive, the ghola voice.\\n\\n \"She understands,\" Leto said. \"It is human to have your soul brought to a crisis you did not anticipate. That\u0027s the way it always is with humans. Moneo understood at last.\"\\n\\n \"I wish he\u0027d hurry up and die!\" Siona said.\\n\\n \"I am the divided god and you would make me whole,\" Leto said. \"Duncan? I think of all my Duncans I approve of you the most.\"\\n\\n \"Approve?\" Some of the rage returned to Idaho\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s magic in my approval,\" Leto said. \"Anything\u0027s possible in a magic universe. Your life has been dominated by the Oracle\u0027s fatality, not mine. Now, you see the mysterious caprices and you would ask me to dispel this? I wished only to increase it.\" The others within Leto began to reassert themselves. Without the solidarity of the colonial group to support his identity, he began to lose his place among them. They started speaking the language of the constant \"IF.\" \"If you had only... If we had but...\" He wanted to shout them into silence.\\n\\n \"Only fools prefer the past!\"\\n\\n Leto did not know if he truly shouted or only thought it. The response was a momentary inner silence matched to an outer silence and he felt some of the threads of his old identity still intact. He tried to speak and knew the reality of it because Idaho said, \"Listen, he\u0027s trying to say something.\"\\n\\n \"Do not fear the lxians,\" he said, and he heard his own voice as a fading whisper. \"They can make the machines, but they no longer can make arafel. I know. I was there.\"\\n\\n He fell silent, gathering his strength, but he felt the energy flowing from him even as he tried to hold it. Once more, the clamor arose within him-voices pleading and shouting.\\n\\n \"Stop that foolishness!\" he cried, or thought he cried.\\n\\n Idaho and Siona heard only a gasping hiss.\\n\\n Presently, Siona said: \"I think he\u0027s dead.\"\\n\\n \"And everyone thought he was immortal,\" Idaho said.\\n\\n \"Do you know what the Oral History says?\" Siona asked. \"If you want immortality, then deny form. Whatever has form has mortality. Beyond form is the formless, the immortal.\"\\n\\n \"That sounds like him,\" Idaho accused.\\n\\n \"I think it was,\" she said.\\n\\n \"What did he mean about your descendants... hiding, not finding them?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n \"He created a new kind of mimesis,\" she said, \"a new biological imitation. He knew he had succeeded. He could not see me in his futures.\"\\n\\n \"What are you?\" Idaho demanded.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m the new Atreides.\"\\n\\n \"Atreides!\" It was a curse in Idaho\u0027s voice.\\n\\n Siona stared down at the disintegrating hulk which once had been Leto Atreides II... and something else. The something else was sloughing away in faint wisps of blue smoke where the smell of melange was strongest. Puddles of blue liquid formed in the rocks beneath his melting bulk. Only faint vague shapes which might once have been human remained-a collapsed foaming pinkness, a bit of red-streaked bone which could have held the forms of cheeks and brow...\\n\\n Siona said: \"I am different, but still I am what he was.\"\\n\\n Idaho spoke in a hushed whisper: \"The ancestors, all of...\"\\n\\n \"The multitude is there but I walk silently among them and no one sees me. The old images are gone and only the essence remains to light his Golden Path.\"\\n\\n She turned and took Idaho\u0027s cold hand in hers. Carefully, she led him out of the cave into the light where the rope dangled invitingly from the barrier Wall\u0027s top, from the place where the frightened Museum Fremen waited.\\n\\n Poor material with which to shape a new universe, she thought, but they would have to serve. Idaho would require gentle seduction, a care within which love might appear.\\n\\n When she looked down the river to where the flow emerged from its man-made chasm to spread across the green lands, she saw a wind from the south driving dark clouds toward her.\\n\\n Idaho withdrew his hand from hers, but he appeared calmer. \"Weather control is increasingly unstable,\" he said. \"Moneo thought it was the Guild\u0027s doing.\"\\n\\n \"My father was seldom mistaken about such things,\" she said. \"You will have to look into that.\"\\n\\n Idaho experienced a sudden memory of the silvery shapes of sandtrout darting away from Leto\u0027s body in the river.\\n\\n \"I heard the Worm,\" Siona said. \"The Fish Speakers will follow you, not me.\"\\n\\n Again, Idaho sensed the temptation from the ritual of Siaynoq. \"We will see,\" he said. He turned and looked at Siona. \"What did he mean when he said the lxians cannot create arafel?\"\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t read all the journals,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll show you when we return to Tuono.\"\\n\\n \"But what does it mean-arafel?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the cloud-darkness of holy judgment. It\u0027s from an old story. You\u0027ll find it all in my journals.\"\\n\\n - \u003d Excerpt from the Hadi Benotto secret summation on the discoveries at Dar-es-Balat:\\n\\n Herewith THE minority report. We will, of course, comply with the majority decision to apply a careful screening, editing and censorship to the journals from Dar-es-Balat, but our arguments must be heard. We recognize the interest of Holy Church in these matters and the political dangers have not escaped our notice. We share a desire with the Church that Rakis and the Holy Reservation of the Divided God not become \"an attraction for gawking tourists.\"\\n\\n However, now that all of the journals are in our hands, authenticated and translated, the clear shape of the Atreides Design emerges. As a woman trained by the Bene Gesserit to understand the ways of our ancestors, I have a natural desire to share the pattern we have exposed which is so much more than Dune to Arrakis to Dune, thence to Rakis.\\n\\n The interests of history and science must be served. The journals throw a valuable new light onto that accumulation of personal recollections and biographies from the Duncan Days, the Guard Bible. We cannot be unmindful of those familiar oaths: \"By the Thousand Sons of Idaho!\" and \"By the Nine Daughters of Siona!\" The persistent Cult of Sister Chenoeh assumes new significance because of the journals\u0027 disclosures. Certainly, the Church\u0027s characterization of Judas/Nayla deserves careful reevaluation.\\n\\n We of the Minority must remind the political censors that the poor sandworms in their Rakian Reservation cannot provide us with an alternative to Ixian Navigation Machines, nor are the tiny amounts of Church-controlled melange any real commercial threat to the products of the Tleilaxu vats. No! We argue that the myths, the Oral History, the Guard Bible, and even the Holy Books of the Divided God must be compared with the journals from Dar-es-Balat. Every historical reference to the Scattering and the Famine Times has to be taken out and reexamined! What have we to fear? No Ixian machine can do what we, the descendants of Duncan Idaho and Siona, have done. How many universes have we populated? None can guess. No one person will ever know. Does the Church fear the occasional prophet? We know that the visionaries cannot see us nor predict our decisions. No death can find all of humankind. Must we of the Minority join our fellows of the Scattering before we can be heard? Must we leave the original core of humankind ignorant and uninformed? If the Majority drives us out, you know we never again can be found!\\n\\n We do not want to leave. We are held here by those pearls in the sand. We are fascinated by the Church\u0027s use of the pearl as \"the sun of understanding.\" Surely, no reasoning human can escape the journals\u0027 revelations in this regard. The admittedly fugitive but vital uses of archeology must have their day! Just as the primitive machine with which Leto I concealed his journals can only teach us about the evolution of our machines, just so, that ancient awareness must be allowed to speak to us. It would be a crime against both historical accuracy and science for us to abandon our attempts at communication with those \"pearls of awareness\" which the journals have located. Is Leto II lost in his endless dream or could he be reawakened to our times, brought to full consciousness as a storehouse of historical accuracy? How can Holy Church fear this truth?\\n\\n For the Minority, we have no doubt that historians must listen to that voice from our beginnings. If it is only the journals, we must listen. We must listen across at least as many years into our future as those journals lay hidden in our past. We will not try to predict the discoveries yet to be made within those pages. We say only that they must be made. How can we turn our backs on our most important inheritance? As the poet, Lon Bramlis, has said: \"We are the fountain of surprises!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-33.html","bookId":2156,"book":{"id":2156,"title":"God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4) \\n More than three thousand years have passed since the first events recorded in DUNE. Only one link survives with those tumultuous times: the grotesque figure of Leto Atreides, son of the prophet Paul Muad\u0027Dib, and now the virtually immortal God Emperor of Dune. He alone understands the future, and he knows with a terrible certainty that the evolution of his race is at an end unless he can breed new qualities into his species. But to achieve his final victory, Leto Atreides must also bring about his own downfall...\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4.jpg","author":"Frank Herbert","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:21 PM"}}
