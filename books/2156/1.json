{"id":97298,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Excerpt from the speech by Hadi Benotto announcing the discoveries at Dar-es-Balat on the planet of Rakis:\\n\\n IT NOT only is my pleasure to announce to you this morning our discovery of this marvelous storehouse containing, among other things, a monumental collection of manuscripts inscribed on ridulian crystal paper, but I also take pride in giving you our arguments for the authenticity of our discoveries, to tell you why we believe we have uncovered the original journals of Leto II, the God Emperor.\\n\\n First, let me recall to you the historical treasure which we all know by the name of The Stolen Journals, those volumes of known antiquity which over the centuries have been so valuable in helping us to understand our ancestors. As you all know, The Stolen Journals were deciphered by the Spacing Guild, and the method of the Guild Key was employed to translate these newly discovered volumes. No one denies the antiquity of the Guild Key and it, and it alone, translates these volumes.\\n\\n Second, these volumes were printed by an Ixian dictatel of truly ancient make. The Stolen Journals leave no doubt that this was in fact the method employed by Leto II to record his historical observations.\\n\\n Third and we believe that this is equal in portent to the actual discovery, there is the storehouse itself. The repository for these journals is an undoubted Ixian artifact of such primitive and yet marvelous construction that it is sure to throw new light on the historical epoch known as \"The Scattering.\" As was to be expected, the storehouse was invisible. It was buried far deeper than myth and the Oral History had led us to expect and it emitted radiation and absorbed radiation to simulate the natural character of its surroundings, a mechanical mimesis which is not surprising of itself. What has surprised our engineers, however, is the way this was done with the most rudimentary and truly primitive mechanical skills.\\n\\n I can see that some of you are as excited by this as we were.\\n\\n We believe we are looking at the first Ixian Globe, the noroom from which all such devices evolved. If it is not actually the first, we believe it must be one of the first and embodying the same principles as the first.\\n\\n Let me address your obvious curiosity by assuring you that we will take you on a brief tour of the storehouse presently. We will ask only that you maintain silence while within the storehouse because our engineers and other specialists are still at work there unraveling the mysteries.\\n\\n Which brings me to my fourth point, and this may well be the capstone of our discoveries. It is with emotions difficult to describe that I reveal to you now another discovery at this site-namely, actual oral recordings which are labeled as having been made by Leto II in the voice of his father, Paul Muad\u0027Dib. Since authenticated recordings of the God Emperor are lodged in the Bene Gesserit Archives, we have sent a sampling of our recordings, all of which were made on an ancient microbubble system, to the Sisterhood with a formal request that they conduct a comparison test. We have little doubt that the recordings will be authenticated.\\n\\n Now, please turn your attention to the translated excerpts which were handed to you as you entered. Let me take this opportunity to apologize for their weight. I have heard some of you joking about that. We used ordinary paper for a practical reason-economy. The original volumes are inscribed in symbols so small that they must be magnified substantially before they can be read. In fact, it requires more than forty ordinary volumes of the type you now hold just to reprint the contents of one of the ridulian crystal originals.\\n\\n If the projector-yes. We are now projecting part of an original page onto the screen at your left. This is from the first page of the first volume. Our translation is on the screens to the right. I call your attention to the internal evidence, the poetic vanity of the words as well as the meaning derived from the translation. The style conveys a personality which is identifiable and consistent. We believe that this could only have been written by someone who had the direct experience of ancestral memories, by someone laboring to share that extraordinary experience of previous lives in a way that could be understood by those not so gifted.\\n\\n Look now at the actual meaning content. All of the references accord with everything history has told us about the one person whom we believe is the only person who could have written such an account.\\n\\n We have another surprise for you now. I have taken the liberty of inviting the well-known poet, Rebeth Vreeb, to share the platform with us this morning and to read from this first page a short passage of our translation. It is our observation that, even in translation, these words take on a different character when read aloud. We want to share with you a truly extraordinary quality which we have discovered in these volumes.\\n\\n Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Rebeth Vreeb.\\n\\n From the reading by Rebeth Vreeb:\\n\\n I ASSURE you that I am the book of fate.\\n\\n Questions are my enemies. For my questions explode! Answers leap up like a frightened flock, blackening the sky of my inescapable memories. Not one answer, not one suffices.\\n\\n What prisms flash when I enter the terrible field of my past. I am a chip of shattered flint enclosed in a box. The box gyrates and quakes. I am tossed about in a storm of mysteries. And when the box opens, I return to this presence like a stranger in a primitive land.\\n\\n Slowly (slowly, I say) I relearn my name.\\n\\n But that is not to know myself!\\n\\n This person of my name, this Leto who is the second of that calling, finds other voices in his mind, other names and other places. Oh, I promise you (as I have been promised) that I answer to but a single name. If you say, \"Leto,\" I respond. Sufferance makes this true, sufferance and one thing more:\\n\\n I hold the threads!\\n\\n All of them are mine. Let me but imagine a topicsay... men who have died by the sword-and I have them in all of their gore, every image intact, every moan, every grimace.\\n\\n Joys of motherhood, I think, and the birthing beds are mine. Serial baby smiles and the sweet cooings of new generations. The first walkings of the toddlers and the first victories of youths brought forth for me to share. They tumble one upon another until I can see little else but sameness and repetition.\\n\\n \"Keep it all intact,\" I warn myself. Who can deny the value of such experiences, the worth of learning through which I view each new instant? Ahhh, but it\u0027s the past. Don\u0027t you understand? It\u0027s only the past!\\n\\n This morning I was born in a yurt at the edge of a horse-plain in a land of a planet which no longer exists. Tomorrow I will be born someone else in another place. II have not yet chosen. This morning, though-ahhh, this life! When my eyes had learned to focus, I looked out at sunshine on trampled grass and I saw vigorous people going about the sweet activities of their lives. Where... oh where has all of that vigor gone?\\n\\n - The Stolen Journals THE THREE people running northward through moon shadows in the Forbidden Forest were strung out along almost half a kilometer. The last runner in the line ran less than a hundred meters ahead of the pursuing D-wolves. The animals could be heard yelping and panting in their eagerness, the way they do when they have the prey in sight.\\n\\n With First Moon almost directly overhead, it was quite light in the forest and, although these were the higher latitudes of Arrakis it was still warm from the heat of a summer day. The nightly drift of air from the Last Desert of the Sareer carried resin smells and the damp exhalations of the duff underfoot. Now and again, a breeze from the Kynes Sea beyond the Sareer drifted across the runners\u0027 tracks with hints of salt and fishes.\\n\\n By a quirk of fate, the last runner was called Ulot, which in the Fremen tongue means \"Beloved Straggler.\" Ulot was short in stature and with a tendency to fat which had placed an extra dieting burden on him in training for this venture. Even when slimmed down for their desperate run, his face remained round, the large brown eyes vulnerable in that suggestion of too much flesh.\\n\\n To Ulot it was obvious that he could not run much farther. He panted and wheezed. Occasionally, he staggered. But he did not call out to his companions. He knew they could not help him. All of them had taken the same oath, knowing they had no defenses except the old virtues and Fremen loyalties. This remained true even though everything that once had been Fremen had now a museum quality-rote recitals learned from Museum Fremen.\\n\\n It was Fremen loyalty that kept Ulot silent in the full awareness of his doom. A fine display of the ancient qualities, and rather pitiful when none of the runners had any but book knowledge and the legends of the Oral History about the virtues they aped.The D-wolves ran close behind Ulot, giant gray figures almost manheight at the shoulders. They leaped and whined in their eagerness, heads lifted, eyes focused on the moon betrayed figure of their quarry.\\n\\n A root caught Ulot\u0027s left foot and he almost fell. This gave him renewed energy. He put on a burst of speed, gaining perhaps a wolf length on his pursuers. His arms pumped. He breathed noisily through his open mouth.\\n\\n The D-wolves did not change pace. They were silver shadows which went flick-flick through the loud green smells of their forest. They knew they had won. It was a familiar experience.\\n\\n Again, Ulot stumbled. He caught his balance against a sapling and continued his panting flight, gasping, his legs trembling in rebellion against these demands. No energy remained for another burst of speed.\\n\\n One of the D-wolves, a large female, moved out on Ulot\u0027s left flank. She swerved inward and leaped across his path. Giant fangs ripped Ulot\u0027s shoulder and staggered him but he did not fall. The pungency of blood was added to the forest smells. A smaller male caught his right hip and at last Ulot fell, screaming. The pack pounced and his screams were cut off in abrupt finality.\\n\\n Not stopping to feed, the D-wolves again took up the chase. Their noses probed the forest floor and the vagrant eddies in the air, scenting the warm tracery of two more running humans.\\n\\n The next runner in the line was named Kwuteg, an old and honorable name on Arrakis, a name from the Dune times. An ancestor had served Sietch Tabr as Master of the Deathstills, but that was more than three thousand years lost in a past which many no longer believed. Kwuteg ran with the long strides of a tall and slender body which seemed perfectly fitted to such exertion. Long black hair streamed back from his aquiline features. As with his companions, he wore a black running suit of tightly knitted cotton. It revealed the workings of his buttocks and stringy thighs, the deep and steady rhythm of his breathing. Only his pace, which was markedly slow for Kwuteg, betrayed the fact that he had injured his right knee coming down from the man-made precipices which girdled the God Emperor\u0027s Citadel fortress in the Sareer.\\n\\n Kwuteg heard Ulot\u0027s screams, the abrupt and potent silence, then the renewed chase-yelps of the D-wolves. He tried not to let his mind create the image of another friend being slain by Leto\u0027s monster guardians but imagination worked its sorcery on him. Kwuteg thought a curse against the tyrant but wasted no breath to voice it. There remained a chance that he could reach the sanctuary of the Idaho River. Kwuteg knew what his friends thought about him-even Siona. He had always been known as a conservative. Even as a child he had saved his energy until it counted most, parceling out his reserves like a miser.\\n\\n In spite of the injured knee, Kwuteg increased his pace. He knew the river was near. His injury had gone beyond agony into a steady flame which filled his entire leg and side with its burning. He knew the limits of his endurance. He knew also that Siona should be almost at the water. The fastest runner of them all, she carried the sealed packet and, in it, the things they had stolen from the fortress in the Sareer. Kwuteg focused his thoughts on that packet as he ran.\\n\\n Save it, Siona! Use it to destroy him!\\n\\n The eager whining of the D-wolves penetrated Kwuteg\u0027s consciousness. They were too close. He knew then that he would not escape.\\n\\n But Siona must escape!\\n\\n He risked a backward glance and saw one of the wolves move to flank him. The pattern of their attack plan imprinted itself on his awareness. As the flanking wolf leaped Kwuteg also leaped. Placing a tree between himself and the pack, he ducked beneath the flanking wolf, grasped one of its hind legs in both hands and, without stopping, whirled the captive wolf as a flail which scattered the others. Finding the creature not as heavy as he had expected, almost welcoming the change of action, he flailed his living bludgeon at the attackers in a dervish whirl which brought two of them down in a crash of skulls. But he could not guard every side. A lean male caught him in the back, hurling him against a tree and he lost his bludgeon.\\n\\n \"Go!\" he screamed.\\n\\n The pack bored in and Kwuteg caught the throat of the lean male in his teeth. He bit down with every gram of his final desperation. Wolf blood spurted over his face, blinding him. Rolling without any knowledge of where he went, Kwuteg grappled another wolf. Part of the pack dissolved into a yelping, whirling mob, some turning against their own injured. Most of the pack remained intent on the quarry, though. Teeth ripped Kwuteg\u0027s throat from both sides.\\n\\n Siona, too, had heard Ulot scream, then the unmistakable silence followed by the yelping of the pack as the wolves resumed the chase. Such anger filled her that she felt she might explode with it. Ulot had been included in this venture because of his analytical ability, his way of seeing a whole from only a few parts. It had been Ulot who, taking the inevitable magnifier from his kit, had examined the two strange volumes they had found in with the Citadel\u0027s plans.\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s a cipher,\" Ulot had said.\\n\\n And Radi, poor Radi who had been the first of their team to die... Radi had said, \"We can\u0027t afford the extra weight. Throw them away.\"\\n\\n Ulot had objected: \"Unimportant things aren\u0027t concealed this way.\"\\n\\n Kwuteg had joined Radi. \"We came for the Citadel plans and we have them. Those things are too heavy.\"\\n\\n But Siona had agreed with Ulot. \"I will carry them.\"\\n\\n That had ended the argument.\\n\\n Poor Ulot.\\n\\n They had all known him as the worst runner in the team. Ulot was slow in most things, but the clarity of his mind could not be denied.\\n\\n He is trustworthy.\\n\\n Ulot had been trustworthy.\\n\\n Siona mastered her anger and used its energy to increase her pace. Trees whipped past her in the moonlight. She had entered that timeless void of the running when there was nothing else but her own movements, her own body doing what it had been conditioned to do.\\n\\n Men thought her beautiful when she ran. Siona knew this. Her long dark hair was tied tightly to keep it from whipping in the wind of her passage. She had accused Kwuteg of foolishness when he had refused to copy her style.\\n\\n Where is Kwuteg?\\n\\n Her hair was not like Kwuteg\u0027s. It was that deep brown which is sometimes confused with black, but is not truly black, not like Kwuteg\u0027s at all.\\n\\n In the way genes occasionally do, her features copied those of a long dead ancestor: gently oval and with a generous mouth, eyes of alert awareness above a small nose. Her body had grown lanky from years of running, but it sent strong sexual signals to the males around her.\\n\\n Where is Kwuteg?\\n\\n The wolf pack had fallen silent and this filled her with alarm. They had done that before bringing down Radi. It had been the same when they got Setuse.\\n\\n She told herself the silence could mean other things. Kwuteg, too, was silent... and strong. The injury had not appeared to bother him too much.\\n\\n Siona began to feel pain in her chest, the gasping-to-come which she knew well from the long kilometers of training. Perspiration still poured down her body under the thin, black running garment. The kit, with its precious contents sealed against the river passage ahead, rode high on her back. She thought about the Citadel charts folded there.\\n\\n Where does Leto hide his hoard of spice?\\n\\n It had to be somewhere within the Citadel. It had to be. Somewhere in the charts there would be a clue. The melange spice for which the Bene Gesserit, the Guild and all the others hungered... that was a prize worth this risk.\\n\\n And those two cryptic volumes. Kwuteg had been right in one thing. Ridulian crystal paper was heavy. But she shared Ulot\u0027s excitement. Something important was concealed in those lines of cipher.\\n\\n Once more the eager chase-yelps of the wolves sounded in the forest behind her.\\n\\n Run, Kwuteg! Run!\\n\\n Now, just ahead of her through the trees, she could see the wide cleared strip which bordered the Idaho River. She glimpsed moon brightness on water beyond the clearing.\\n\\n Run, Kwuteg!\\n\\n She longed for a sound from Kwuteg, any sound. Only the\\n\\n two of them remained now from the eleven who had started the run. Nine had paid for this venture with their lives: Radi, Aline, Ulot, Setuse, lnineg, Onemao, Hutye, Memar and Oala.\\n\\n Siona thought their names and with each sent a silent prayer to the old gods, not to the tyrant Leto. Especially, she prayed to Shai-Hulud.\\n\\n \"I pray to Shai-Hulud, who lives in the sand.\"\\n\\n Abruptly, she was out of the forest and onto the moon-bright stretch of mowed ground along the river. Straight ahead beyond a narrow shingle of beach, the water beckoned to her. The beach was silver against the oily flow.\\n\\n A loud yell from back in the trees almost made her falter. She recognized Kwuteg\u0027s voice above the wild wolf sounds. Kwuteg called out to her without name, an unmistakable cry with one word containing countless conversations-a message of death and life.\\n\\n \"Go!\"\\n\\n The pack sounds took on a terrible commotion of frenzied yelps, but nothing more from Kwuteg. She knew then how Kwuteg was spending the last energies of his life.\\n\\n Delaying them to help me escape.\\n\\n Obeying Kwuteg\u0027s cry, she dashed to the river\u0027s edge and plunged headfirst into the water. The river was a freezing shock after the heat of the run. It stunned her for a moment and she floundered outward, struggling to swim and regain her breath. The precious kit floated and bumped against the back of her head.\\n\\n The Idaho River was not wide here, no more than fifty meters, a gently sweeping curve with sandy indentations fringed by roots and shelving banks of lush reeds and grass where the water refused to stay in the straight lines Leto\u0027s engineers had designed. Siona was strengthened by the knowledge that the D-wolves had been conditioned to stop at the water. Their territorial boundaries had been drawn, the river on this side and the desert wall on the other side. Still, she swam the last few meters underwater and surfaced in the shadows of a cutbank before turning and looking back.\\n\\n The wolf pack stood ranged along the bank, all except one which had come down to the river\u0027s edge. It leaned forward with its forefeet almost into the flow. She heard it whine.\\n\\n Siona knew the wolf saw her. No doubt of that. D-wolves were noted for their keen eyesight. There were Gaze Hounds\\n\\n in the ancestry of Leto\u0027s forest guardians and he bred the wolves for their eyesight. She wondered if this once the wolves might break through their conditioning. They were mostly sight-hunters. If that one wolf at the river\u0027s edge should enter the water, all might follow. Siona held her breath. She felt the dragging of exhaustion. They had come almost thirty kilometers, the last half of it with the D-wolves close behind.\\n\\n The wolf at the river\u0027s edge whined once more then leaped back up to its companions. At some silent signal, they turned and loped back into the forest.\\n\\n Siona knew where they would go. D-wolves were allowed to eat anything they brought down in the Forbidden Forest. Everyone knew this. It was why the wolves roamed the forest the guardians of the Sareer.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll pay for this, Leto,\" she whispered. It was a low sound, her voice, very close to the quiet rustling of the water against the reeds just behind her. \"You\u0027ll pay for Ulot, for Kwuteg and for all the others. You\u0027ll pay.\"\\n\\n She pushed outward gently and drifted with the current until her feet met the first shelving of a narrow beach. Slowly, her body dragged down by fatigue, she climbed from the water and paused to check that the sealed contents of her kit had remained dry. The seal was unbroken. She stared at it a moment in the moonlight, then lifted her gaze to the forest wall across the river.\\n\\n The price we paid. Ten dear friends.\\n\\n Tears glimmered in her eyes, but she had the stuff of the ancient Fremen and her tears were few. The venture across the river, directly through the forest while the wolves patrolled the northern boundaries, then across the Last Desert of the Sareer and over the Citadel\u0027s ramparts-all of this already was assuming dream proportions in her mind... even the flight from the wolves which she had anticipated because it was a certainty that the guardian pack would cross the track of the invaders and be waiting... all a dream. It was the past.\\n\\n I escaped.\\n\\n She restored the kit with its sealed packet and fastened it once more against her back.\\n\\n I have broken through your defenses, Leto.\\n\\n Siona thought then about the cryptic volumes. She felt certain that something hidden in those lines of cipher would open the way for her revenge.\\n\\n l will destroy you, Leto!\\n\\n Not We will destroy you! That was not Siona\u0027s way. She would do it herself.\\n\\n She turned and strode toward the orchards beyond the river\u0027s mowed border. As she walked she repeated her oath, adding to it aloud the old Fremen formula which terminated in her full name:\\n\\n \"Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa Atreides it is who curses you, Leto. You will pay in full!\"\\n\\n The following is from the Hadi Benotto translation of the volumes discovered at Dar-es-Balat:\\n\\n I WAS born Leto Atreides II more than three thousand standard years ago, measuring from the moment when I cause these words to be printed. My father was Paul Muad\u0027Dib. My mother was his Fremen consort, Chani. My maternal grandmother was Faroula, a noted herbalist among the Fremen. My paternal grandmother was Jessica, a product of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme in their search for a male who could share the powers of the Sisterhood\u0027s Reverend Mothers. My maternal grandfather was Liet-Kynes, the planetologist who organized the ecological transformation of Arrakis. My paternal grandfather was Leto Atreides, descendant of the House of Atreus and tracing his ancestry directly back to the Greek original.\\n\\n Enough of these begats!\\n\\n My paternal grandfather died as many good Greeks did, attempting to kill his mortal enemy, the old Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Both of them rest uncomfortably now in my ancestral memories. Even my father is not content. I have done what he feared to do and now his shade must share in the consequences.\\n\\n The Golden Path demands it. And what is the Golden Path? you ask. It is the survival of humankind, nothing more nor less. We who have prescience, we who know the pitfalls in our human futures, this has always been our responsibility.\\n\\n Survival.\\n\\n How you feel about this-your petty woes and joys, even your agonies and raptures-seldom concerns us. My father had this power. I have it stronger. We can peer now and again through the veils of Time.\\n\\n This planet of Arrakis from which I direct my multigalactic Empire is no longer what it was in the days when it was known as Dune. In those days, the entire planet was a desert. Now, there is just this little remnant, my Sareer. No longer does the giant sandworm roam free, producing the spice melange. The spice! Dune was noteworthy only as the source of melange, the only.source. What an extraordinary substance. No laboratory has ever been able to duplicate it. And it is the most valuable substance humankind has ever found.\\n\\n Without melange to ignite the linear prescience of Guild Navigators, people cross the parsecs of space only at a snail\u0027s crawl. Without melange, the Bene Gesserit cannot endow Truthsayers or Reverend Mothers. Without the geriatric properties of melange, people live and die according to the ancient measure-no more than a hundred years or so. Now, the only spice is held in Guild and Bene Gesserit storehouses, a few small hoards among the remnants of the Great Houses, and my gigantic hoard which they all covet. How they would like to raid me! But they don\u0027t dare. They know I would destroy it all before surrendering it.\\n\\n No They come hat in hand and petition me for melange. I dole it out as a reward and hold it back as punishment. How they hate that.\\n\\n It is my power, I tell them. It is my gift.\\n\\n With it, I create Peace. They have had more than three thousand years of Leto\u0027s Peace. It is an enforced tranquility which humankind knew only for the briefest periods before my ascendancy. Lest you have forgotten, study Leto\u0027s Peace once more in these, my journals.\\n\\n I began this account in the first year of my stewardship, in the first throes of my metamorphosis when I was still mostly human, even visibly so. The sandtrout skin which I accepted (and my father refused) and which gave me greatly amplified strength plus virtual immunity from conventional attack and aging-that skin still covered a form recognizably human: two legs, two arms, a human face framed in the scrolled folds of the sandtrout.\\n\\n Ahhh, that face! I still have it-the only human skin I expose to the universe. All the rest of my flesh has remained covered by the linked bodies of those tiny deep sand vectors which one day can become giant sandworms.\\n\\n As they will... someday.\\n\\n I often think about my final metamorphosis, that likeness of death. I know the way it must come but I do not know the moment or the other players. This is the one thing I cannot know. I only know whether the Golden Path continues or ends.\\n\\n As I cause these words to be recorded, the Golden Path continues and for that, at least, I am content.\\n\\n I no longer feel the sandtrout cilia probing my flesh, encapsulating the water of my body within their placental barriers. We are virtually one body now, they my skin and I the force which moves the whole... most of the time.\\n\\n At this writing, the whole could be considered rather gross. I am what could be called a pre-worm. My body is about seven meters long and somewhat more than two meters in diameter, ribbed for most of its length, with my Atreides face positioned man-height at one end, the arms and hands (still quite recognizable as human) just below. My legs and feet? Well, they are mostly atrophied. Just flippers, really, and they have wandered back along my body. The whole of me weighs approximately five old tons. These items I append because I know they will have historical interest.\\n\\n How do I carry this weight around? Mostly on my Royal Cart, which is of Ixian manufacture. You are shocked? People invariably hated and feared the Ixians even more than they hated and feared me. Better the devil you know. And who knows what the Ixians might manufacture or invent? Who knows?\\n\\n I certainly don\u0027t. Not all of it.\\n\\n But I have a certain sympathy for the Ixians. They believe so strongly in their technology, their science, their machines. Because we believe (no matter the content) we understand each other, the Ixians and I. They make many devices for me and think they earn my gratitude thus. These very words you are reading were printed by an Ixian device, a dictatel it is called. If I cast my thoughts in a particular mode, the dictatel is activated. I merely think in this mode and the words are printed for me on ridulian crystal sheets only one molecule thick. Sometimes I order copies printed on material of lesser permanence. It was two of these latter types that were stolen from me by Siona.\\n\\n Isn\u0027t she fascinating, my Siona? As you come to understand her importance to me, you may even question whether I really would have let her die there in the forest. Have no doubt about it. Death is a very personal thing. I will seldom interfere with it. Never in the case of someone who must be tested as Siona requires. I could let her die at any stage. After all, I could bring up a new candidate in very little time as I measure time.\\n\\n She fascinates even me, though. I watched her there in the forest. Through my Wan devices I watched her, wondering why I had not anticipated this venture. But Siona is... Siona. That is why I made no move to stop the wolves. It would have been wrong to do that. The D-wolves are but an extension of my purpose and my purpose is to be the greatest predator ever known.\\n\\n - The Journals of Leto The following brief dialogue is credited to a manuscript source called \"The Welbeck Fragment.\" The reputed author is Siona Atreides. The participants are Siona herself and her father, Moneo, who was (as all the histories tell us) a majordomo and chief aide to Leto II. It is dated at a time when Siona was still in her teens and was being visited by her father at her quarters in the Fish Speakers\u0027 School at the Festival City of Onn, a major population center on the planet now known as Rakis. According to the manuscript identification papers, Moneo had visited his daughter secretly to warn her that she risked destruction.\\n\\n SIONA: How have you survived with him for so long a time, father? He kills those who are close to him. Everyone knows that.\\n\\n MONEO: No! You are wrong. He kills no one.\\n\\n SIONA: You needn\u0027t lie about him.\\n\\n MONEO: I mean it. He kills no one.\\n\\n SIONA: Then how do you account for the known deaths?\\n\\n MONEO: It is the Worm that kills. The Worm is God. Leto lives in the bosom of God, but he kills no one.\\n\\n SIONA: Then how do you survive?\\n\\n MONEO: I can recognize the Worm. I can see it in his face and in his movements. I know when Shai-Hulud approaches.\\n\\n SIONA: He is not Shai-Hulud!\\n\\n MONEO: Well, that\u0027s what they called the Worm in the Fremen days.\\n\\n SIONA: I\u0027ve read about that. But he is not the God of the desert.\\n\\n MONEO: Be quiet, you foolish girl! You know nothing of such things.\\n\\n SIONA: I know that you are a coward.\\n\\n MONEO: How little you know, You have-never stood where I have stood and seen it in his eyes, in the movements of his hands.\\n\\n SIONA: What do you do when the Worm approaches?\\n\\n MONEO: I leave.\\n\\n SIONA: That\u0027s prudent. He has killed nine Duncan Idahos that we know about for sure.\\n\\n MONEO: I tell you he kills no one!\\n\\n SIONA: What\u0027s the difference? Leto or Worm, they are one body now.\\n\\n MONEO: But they are two separate beings-Leto the Emperor and The Worm Who Is God.\\n\\n SIONA: You\u0027re mad!\\n\\n MONEO: Perhaps. But I do serve God. -\u003d I am the most ardent people-watcher who ever lived. I watch them inside me and outside. Past and present can mingle with odd impositions in me. And as the metamorphosis continues in my flesh wonderful things happen to my senses. It\u0027s as though I sensed everything in close-up. I have extremely acute hearing and vision, plus a sense of smell extraordinarily discriminating. I can detect and identify pheromones at three parts per million. I know. I have tested it. You cannot hide very much from my senses. I think it would horrify you what I can detect by smell alone. Your pheromones tell me what you are doing or are prepared to do. And gesture and posture! I stared for half a day once at an old man sitting on a bench in Arrakeen. He was a fifth-generation descendant of Stilgar the Naib and did not even know it. I studied the angle of his neck, the skin flaps below his chin, the cracked lips and moistness about his nostrils, the pores behind his ears, the wisps of gray hair which crept from beneath the hood of his antique stillsuit. Not once did he detect that he was being watched. Hah! Stilgar would have known it in a second or two. But this old man was just waiting for someone who never came. He got up finally and tottered off. He was very stiff after all of that sitting. I knew I would never see him in the flesh again. He was that near death and his water was sure to be wasted. Well, that no longer mattered.\\n\\n - The Stolen Journals LETO THOUGHT it the most interesting place in the universe, this place where he awaited the arrival of his current Duncan Idaho. By most human standards, it was a gigantic space, the core of an elaborate series of catacombs beneath his Citadel. Radiating chambers thirty meters high and twenty meters wide ran like spokes from the hub where he waited. His cart had been positioned at the center of the hub in a domed and circular chamber four hundred meters in diameter and one hundred meters high at its tallest point above him.\\n\\n He found these dimensions reassuring.\\n\\n It was early afternoon at the Citadel, but the only light in his chamber came from the random drifting of a few suspensorborne glowglobes tuned into low orange. The light did not penetrate far into the spokes, but Leto\u0027s memories told him the exact position of everything there the water, the bones, the dust of his ancestors and of the Atreides who had lived and died since the Dune times. All of them were here, plus a few containers of melange to create the illusion that this was all of his hoard should it ever come to such an extreme.\\n\\n Leto knew why the Duncan was coming. Idaho had learned that the Tleilaxu were making another Duncan, another ghola created to the specifications demanded by the God Emperor. This Duncan feared that he was being replaced after almost sixty years of service. It was always something of that nature which began the subversion of the Duncans. A Guild envoy had waited upon Leto earlier to warn that the Ixians had delivered a lasgun to this Duncan.\\n\\n Leto chuckled. The Guild remained extremely sensitive to anything which might threaten their slender supply of spice. They were terrified at the thought that Leto was the last link with the sandworms which had produced the original stockpiles of melange.\\n\\n If II die away from water, there will be no more spice-not ever.\\n\\n That was the Guild\u0027s fear. And their historian-accountants assured them Leto sat on the largest store of melange in the universe. This knowledge made the Guild almost reliable as allies.\\n\\n While he waited, Leto did the hand and finger exercises of his Bene Gesserit inheritance. The hands were his pride. Beneath a gray membrane of sandtrout skin, their long digits and opposable thumbs could be used much as any human hands. The almost useless flippers which once had been his feet and legs were more inconvenience than shame. He could crawl, roll and toss his body with astonishing speed, but he sometimes fell on the flippers and there was pain.\\n\\n What was delaying the Duncan?\\n\\n Leto imagined the man vacillating, staring out a window across the fluid horizon of the Sareer. The air was alive with heat today. Before descending to the crypt, Leto had seen a mirage in the southwest. The heat-mirror tipped and flashed an image across the sand, showing him a band of Museum Fremen trudging past a Display Sietch for the edification of tourists.\\n\\n It was cool in the crypt, always cool, the illumination always low. Tunnel spokes were dark holes sloping upward and downward in gentle gradients to accommodate the Royal Cart. Some tunnels extended beyond false walls for many kilometers, passages Leto had created for himself with lxian tools-feeding tunnels and secret ways.\\n\\n As he contemplated the coming interview, a sense of nervousness began to grow in Leto. He found this an interesting emotion, one he had been known to enjoy. Leto knew that he had grown reasonably fond of the current Duncan. There was a reservoir of hope in Leto that the man would survive the coming interview. Sometimes they did. There was little likelihood the Duncan posed a mortal threat, although this had to be left to such chance as existed. Leto had tried to explain this to one of the earlier Duncans... right here in this room.\\n\\n \"You will think it strange that, with my powers, can speak of luck and chance,\" Leto had said.\\n\\n The Duncan had been angry. \"You leave nothing to chance! I know you!\"\\n\\n \"How naive. Chance is the nature of our universe.\"\\n\\n \"Not chance! Mischief. And you\u0027re the author of mischief!\"\\n\\n \"Excellent, Duncan! Mischief is a most profound pleasure. It\u0027s in the ways we deal with mischief that we sharpen creativity.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not even human anymore!\" Oh, how angry the Duncan had been.\\n\\n Leto had found his accusation irritating, like a grain of sand in an eye. He held onto the remnants of his once-human self with a grimness which could not be denied, although irritation was the closest he could come to anger.\\n\\n \"Your life is becoming a cliche,\" Leto had accused.\\n\\n Whereupon the Duncan had produced a small explosive from the folds of his uniform robe. What a surprise!\\n\\n Leto loved surprises, even nasty ones.\\n\\n It is something I did not predict! And he said as much to Duncan, who had stood there oddly undecided now that decision was absolutely demanded of him.\\n\\n \"This could kill you,\" the Duncan said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Duncan. It will do a small amount of injury, no more.\"\\n\\n \"But you said you didn\u0027t predict this!\" The Duncan\u0027s voice had grown shrill.\\n\\n \"Duncan, Duncan, it is absolute prediction which equals death to me. How unutterably boring death is.\"\\n\\n At the last instant, the Duncan had tried to throw the explosive to one side, but the material in it had been unstable and it had gone off too soon. The Duncan had died. Ahh, well-the Tleilaxu always had another in their axlotl tanks.\\n\\n One of the drifting glowglobes above Leto began to blink. Excitement gripped him. Moneo\u0027s signal! Faithful Moneo had alerted his God Emperor that the Duncan was descending to the crypt.\\n\\n The door to the human lift between two spoked passages in the northwest arc of the hub swung open. The Duncan strode forth, a small figure at that distance, but Leto\u0027s eyes discerned even tiny details, a wrinkle on the uniform elbow which said the man had been leaning somewhere, chin in hand. Yes, there were still the marks of his hand on the chin. The Duncan\u0027s odor preceded him: the man was high on his own adrenalin.\\n\\n Leto remained silent while the Duncan approached, observing details. The Duncan still walked with the spring of youth despite all of his long service. He could thank a minimal ingestion of melange for that. The man wore the old Atreides uniform, black with a golden hawk at the left breast. An interesting statement, that: \"I serve the honor of the old Atreides!\" His hair was still the black cap of karakul, the features fixed in stony sharpness with high cheekbones.\\n\\n The Tleilaxu make their gholas well, Leto thought.\\n\\n The Duncan carried a thin briefcase woven of dark brown fibers, one he had carried for many years. It usually contained the material upon which he based his reports, but today it bulged with some heavier weight.\\n\\n The Ixian lasgun.\\n\\n Idaho kept his attention on Leto\u0027s face as he walked. The face remained disconcertingly Atreides, lean features with eyes of total blue which the nervous felt as a physical intrusion. It lurked deep within a gray cowl of sandtrout skin which, Idaho knew, could roll forward protectively in a flickering reflex, a face blink rather than an eye blink. The skin was pink within its gray frame. It was difficult avoiding the thought that Leto\u0027s face was an obscenity, a lost bit of humanity trapped in something alien.\\n\\n Stopping only six paces from the Royal Cart, Idaho did not attempt to conceal his angry determination. He did not even think about whether Leto knew of the lasgun. This Imperium had wandered too far from the old Atreides morality, had become an impersonal juggernaut which crushed the innocent in its path. It had to be ended.\\n\\n \"I have come to talk to you about Siona and other matters,\" Idaho said. He brought the case into position where he could withdraw the lasgun easily.\\n\\n \"Very well.\" Leto\u0027s voice was full of boredom.\\n\\n \"Siona was the only one who escaped, but she still has a base of rebel companions.\"\\n\\n \"You think I don\u0027t know this!\"\\n\\n \"I know your dangerous tolerance for rebels! What I don\u0027t know is the contents of that package she stole.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that. She has the complete plans for the Citadel.\"\\n\\n For just a moment, Idaho was Leto\u0027s Guard Commander, deeply shocked at such a breach of security.\\n\\n \"You let her escape with that?\"\\n\\n \"No, you did.\"\\n\\n Idaho recoiled from this accusation. Slowly. the newly resolved assassin in him regained ascendancy.\\n\\n \"Is that all she got?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n \"I had two volumes, copies of my journal, in with the charts. She stole the copies.\"\\n\\n Idaho studied Leto\u0027s immobile face. \"What is in these journals? Sometimes you say it\u0027s a diary, sometimes a history.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-1.html","bookId":2156,"book":{"id":2156,"title":"God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4) \\n More than three thousand years have passed since the first events recorded in DUNE.
