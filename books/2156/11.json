{"id":97308,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"Are they right?\" Idaho demanded.\\n\\n \"They approach being wrong,\" Leto said. He returned his attention to Moneo. \"No sign of this event must go with us to Onn. Fresh uniforms, new guards to replace the dead and wounded... everything just as it was.\"\\n\\n \"There are dead among your courtiers, Lord,\" Moneo said. \"Replace them!\"\\n\\n Moneo bowed. \"Yes, Lord.\"\\n\\n \"And send for a new canopy to my cart!\"\\n\\n \"As my Lord commands.\"\\n\\n Leto backed his cart a few paces away, turned it and headed for the bridge, calling back to Idaho. \"Duncan, you will accompany me.\"\\n\\n Slowly at first, reluctance heavy in every movement, Idaho left Moneo and the others, then, increasing his pace, came up beside the cart\u0027s open bubble and walked there while staring in at Leto.\\n\\n \"What troubles you, Duncan?\" Leto asked.\\n\\n \"Do you really think of me as your Duncan?\"\\n\\n \"Of course, just as you think of me as your Leto.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you know this attack was coming?\"\\n\\n \"Through my vaunted prescience\u0027\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Yes!\"\\n\\n \"The Face Dancers have not attracted my attention for a long time,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"I presume that is changed now?\"\\n\\n \"Not to any great degree.\"\\n\\n \"Why not\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Because Moneo was correct. I will not let myself be distracted.\"\\n\\n \"Could they really have killed you there?\"\\n\\n \"A distinct possibility. You know, Duncan, few understand what a disaster my end will be.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027re the Tleilaxu plotting?\"\\n\\n \"A snare, I think. A lovely snare. They have sent me a signal, Duncan.\"\\n\\n \"What signal?\"\\n\\n \"There is a new escalation in the desperate motives which drive some of my subjects.\"\\n\\n They left the bridge and began the climb to Leto\u0027s viewpoint. Idaho walked in a fermenting silence.\\n\\n At the top, Leto lifted his gaze over the far cliffs and looked at the barrens of the Sareer.\\n\\n The lamentations of those in his entourage who had lost loved ones continued at the attack scene beyond the bridge. With his acute hearing, Leto could separate Moneo\u0027s voice warning them that the time of mourning was necessarily short. They had other loved ones at the Citadel and they well knew the God Emperor\u0027s wrath.\\n\\n Their tears will be gone and smiles will be pasted on their faces by the time we reach Onn, Leto thought. They think l spurn them! What does that really matter? This is a flickering nuisance among the short-lived and the short- thoughted.\\n\\n The view of the desert soothed him. He could not see the river in its canyon from this point without turning completely around and looking toward the Festival City. The Duncan remained mercifully silent beside the cart. Turning his gaze slightly to the left, Leto could see an edge of the Forbidden Forest. Against that glimpse of verdant landscape, his memory suddenly compressed the Sareer into a tiny, weak remnant of the planet-wide desert which once had been so mighty that all men feared it, even the wild Fremen who had roamed it.\\n\\n It is the river, Leto thought. If I turn, I will.see the thing that I have done.\\n\\n The man-made chasm through which the Idaho River tumbled was only an extension of the Gap which Paul Muad\u0027Dib had blasted through the towering Shield Wall for the passage of his worm mounted legions. Where water flowed now, Muad\u0027Dib had led his Fremen out of a Coriolis storm\u0027s dust into history... and into this.\\n\\n Leto heard Moneo\u0027s familiar footsteps, the sounds of the majordomo laboring up to the viewpoint. Moneo came up to stand beside Idaho and paused a moment to catch his breath.\\n\\n \"How long until we can go on?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n Moneo waved him to silence and addressed Leto. \"Lord, we have had a message from Onn. The Bene Gesserit send word that the Tleilaxu will attack before you reach the bridge.\"\\n\\n Idaho snorted. \"Aren\u0027t they a little late?\"\\n\\n \"It is not their fault,\" Moneo said. \"The captain of the Fish Speaker Guard would not believe them.\"\\n\\n Other members of Leto\u0027s entourage began trickling onto the viewpoint level. Some of them appeared drugged, still in shock. The Fish Speakers moved briskly among them, commanding a show of good spirits.\\n\\n \"Remove the Guard from the Bene Gesserit Embassy.\" Leto said. \"Send them a message. Tell them that their audience will still be the last one, but they are not to fear this. Tell them that the last will be first. They will know the allusion.\"\\n\\n \"What about the Tleilaxu?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n Leto kept his attention on Moneo. \"Yes, the Tleilaxu. We will send them a signal.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Lord?\"\\n\\n \"When I order it, and not until then, you will have the Tleilaxu Ambassador publicly flogged and expelled.\"\\n\\n \"Lord!\"\\n\\n \"You disagree?\"\\n\\n \"If we are to keep this secret\u003d\" Moneo glanced over his shoulder\u003d \"how will you explain the flogging?\"\\n\\n \"We will not explain.\"\\n\\n \"We will give no reason at all?\"\\n\\n \"No reason.\"\\n\\n \"But, Lord, the rumors and the stories that will...\"\\n\\n \"I am reacting, Moneo! Let them sense the underground part of me which does things without my knowing because it has not the wherewithal of knowing.\"\\n\\n \"This will cause great fear, Lord.\"\\n\\n A gruff burst of laughter escaped Idaho. He stepped between Moneo and the cart. \"He does a kindness to this Ambassador! There\u0027ve been rulers who would\u0027ve killed the fool over a slow fire.\"\\n\\n Moneo tried to speak to Leto around Idaho\u0027s shoulder. \"But. Lord, this action will confirm for the Tleilaxu that you were attacked.\"\\n\\n \"They already know that,\" Leto said. \"But they will not talk about it.\"\\n\\n \"And when none of the attackers return...\" Idaho said.\\n\\n \"Do you understand, Moneo?\" Leto asked. \"When we march into Onn apparently unscathed, the Tleilaxu will believe they have suffered utter failure.\"\\n\\n Moneo glanced around at the Fish Speakers and courtiers listening spellbound to this conversation. Seldom had any of them heard such a revealing exchange between the God Emperor and his most immediate aides.\\n\\n \"When will my Lord signal punishment of the Ambassador?\" Moneo asked.\\n\\n \"During the audience.\"\\n\\n Leto heard \u0027thopters coming, saw the glint of sunlight on their wings and rotors and, when he focused intently, made out the fresh canopy for his cart slung beneath one of them.\\n\\n \"Have this damaged canopy returned to the Citadel and restored,\" Leto said, still peering at the approaching \u0027thopters. \"If questions are asked, tell the artisans to say that it\u0027s just routine, another canopy scratched by blown sand.\"\\n\\n Moneo sighed. \"Yes, Lord. It will be done as you say.\"\\n\\n \"Come, Moneo, cheer up,\" Leto said. \"Walk beside me as we continue.\" Turning to Idaho, Leto said, \"Take some of the guards and scout ahead.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think there\u0027ll be another attack\u0027?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n \"No, but it\u0027ll give the guards something to do. And get a fresh uniform. I don\u0027t want you wearing something that has been contaminated by the dirty Tleilaxu-\"\\n\\n Idaho moved off in obedience.\\n\\n Leto signaled Moneo to come closer, closer. When Moneo was bending into the cart, face less than a meter from Leto\u0027s, Leto pitched his voice low and said:\\n\\n \"There is a special lesson here for you, Moneo.\"\\n\\n \"Lord, I know I should have suspected the Face...\"\\n\\n \"Not the Face Dancers! It is a lesson for your daughter.\"\\n\\n \"Siona? What could she...\"\\n\\n \"Tell her this: In a fragile way, she is like that force within me which acts without knowing. Because of her, I remember what it was to be human... and to love.\"\\n\\n Moneo stared at Leto without comprehension.\\n\\n \"Simply give her the message,\" Leto said. \"You needn\u0027t try to understand it. Merely tell her my words.\"\\n\\n Moneo withdrew. \"As my Lord commands.\"\\n\\n Leto closed the bubble canopy, making a single unit of the entire cover for the approaching crews on the \u0027thopters to replace.\\n\\n Moneo turned and glanced around at the people waiting on the flat area of the viewpoint. He noted then a thing he had not observed earlier, a thing revealed by the disarray which some of the people had not yet repaired. Some of the courtiers had fitted themselves with delicate devices to assist their hearing. They had been eavesdropping. And such devices could only come from Ix.\\n\\n I will warn the Duncan and the Guard, Moneo thought.\\n\\n Somehow, he thought of this discovery as a symptom of rot. How could they prohibit such things when most of the courtiers and the Fish Speakers either knew or suspected that the God Emperor traded with Ix for forbidden machines. -\u003d I am beginning to hate water. The sandtrout skin which impels my metamorphosis has learned the sensitivities of the worm. Moneo and many of my guards know my aversion, Only Moneo suspects the truth, that this marks an important waypoint. I can feel my ending in it, not soon as Moneo measures time, but soon enough as I endure it. Sandtrout swarmed to water in the Dune days, a problem during the early stages of our symbiosis. The enforcement of my will power controlled the urge then, and until we reached a time of balance. Now, I must avoid water because there are no other sandtrout, only the half dormant creatures of my skin. Without sandtrout to bring this world back to desert, Shai-Hulud will not emerge; the sandworm cannot evolve until the land is parched. I am their only hope.\\n\\n - The Stolen Journals IT WAS midafternoon before the Royal Entourage came down the final slope into the precincts of the Festival City. Throngs lined the streets to greet them, held back by tight lines of ursine Fish Speakers in uniforms of Atreides green, their stunclubs crossed and linked.\\n\\n As the Royal party approached, a bedlam of shouts erupted from the crowd. Then the Fish Speaker guardians began to chant:\\n\\n \"Siaynoq! Siaynoq! Siaynoq!\"\\n\\n As it echoed back and forth between the high buildings, the chanted word had a strange effect on the crowd which was not initiated into the meanings of it. A wave of silence swept up the thronged avenues while the guardians continued to chant. People stared in awe at the women armed with stunclubs who guarded the Royal passage, the women who chanted while they fixed their gaze on the face of their passing Lord.\\n\\n Idaho, marching with the Fish Speaker guards behind the Royal Cart, heard the chant for the first time and felt the hair on the back of his neck rise.\\n\\n Moneo marched beside the cart, not looking left or right. He had once asked Leto the meaning of the word.\\n\\n \"I give the Fish Speakers only one ritual,\" Leto had said. They had been in the God Emperor\u0027s audience chamber beneath Onn\u0027s central plaza at the time, with Moneo fatigued after a long day of directing the flow of dignitaries who crowded the city for Decennial festivities.\\n\\n \"What has the chanting of that word to do with it, Lord?\"\\n\\n \"The ritual is called Siaynoq-the Feast of Leto. It is the adoration of my person in my presence.\"\\n\\n \"An ancient ritual, Lord?\"\\n\\n \"It was with the Fremen before they were Fremen. But the keys to the Festival secrets died with the old ones. Only I remember them now. I recreate the Festival in my own likeness and for my own ends.\"\\n\\n \"Then the Museum Fremen do not use this ritual?\"\\n\\n \"Never. It is mine and mine alone. I claim eternal right to it because I am that ritual.\"\\n\\n \"It is a strange word, Lord. I have never heard its like.\"\\n\\n \"It has many meanings, Moneo. If I tell them to you, will you hold them secret?\"\\n\\n \"My Lord commands!\"\\n\\n \"Never share this with another nor reveal to the Fish Speakers what I tell you now.\"\\n\\n \"I swear it, Lord.\"\\n\\n \"Very well. Siaynoq means giving honor to one who speaks with sincerity. It signifies the remembrance of things which are spoken with sincerity.\"\\n\\n \"But, Lord, doesn\u0027t sincerity really mean that the speaker believes... has faith in what is said?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but Siaynoq also contains the idea of light as that which reveals reality. You continue to shine light on what you see.\"\\n\\n \"Reality... that is a very ambiguous word, Lord.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed! But Siaynoq also stands for fermentation because reality-or the belief that you know a reality, which is the same thing-always sets up a ferment in the universe.\"\\n\\n \"All of that in a single word, Lord?\"\\n\\n \"And more! Siaynoq also contains the summoning to prayer and the name of the Recording Angel, Sihaya, who interrogates the newly dead.\"\\n\\n \"A great burden for one word, Lord.\"\\n\\n \"Words can carry any burden we wish. All that\u0027s required is agreement and a tradition upon which to build.\"\\n\\n \"Why must I not speak of this to the Fish Speakers, Lord?\"\\n\\n \"Because this is a word reserved for them. They resent my sharing it with a male.\"\\n\\n Moneo\u0027s lips pressed into a thin line of remembrance as he marched beside the Royal Cart into the Festival City. He had heard the Fish Speakers chant the God Emperor into their presence many times since that first explanation and had even added his own meanings to the strange word.\\n\\n It means mystery and prestige. It means power. It invokes a license to act in the name of God.\\n\\n \"Siaynoq! Siaynoq! Siaynoq!\"\\n\\n The word had a sour sound in Moneo\u0027s ears.\\n\\n They were well into the city, almost to the central plaza. Afternoon sunlight came down the Royal Road behind the procession to illuminate the way. It gave brilliance to the citizenry\u0027s colorful costumes. It shone on the upturned faces of the Fish Speakers lining the way.\\n\\n Marching beside the cart with the guards, Idaho put down a first alarm as the chant continued. He asked one of the Fish Speakers beside him about it.\\n\\n \"It is not a word for men,\" she said. \"But sometimes the Lord shares Siaynoq with a Duncan.\"\\n\\n A Duncan! He had asked Leto about it earlier and disliked the mysterious evasions.\\n\\n \"You will learn about it soon enough.\"\\n\\n Idaho relegated the chant to the background while he looked around him with a tourist\u0027s curiosity. In preparation for his duties as Guard Commander, Idaho had inquired after the history of Onn, finding that he shared Leto\u0027s wry amusement in the fact that it was the Idaho River flowing nearby.\\n\\n They had been in one of the large open rooms of the Citadel at the time, an airy place full of morning light and with wide tables upon which Fish Speaker archivists had spread charts of the Sareer and of Onn. Leto had wheeled his cart onto a ramp which allowed him to look down on the charts. Idaho stood across a chart-littered table from him studying the plan of the Festival City.\\n\\n \"Peculiar design for a city,\" Idaho mused.\\n\\n \"It has one primary purpose-public viewing of the God Emperor.\"\\n\\n Idaho looked up at the segmented body on the cart, brought his gaze to the cowled face. He wondered if he would ever find it easy to look on that bizarre figure.\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s only once every ten years,\" Idaho said.\\n\\n \"At the Great Sharing, yes.\"\\n\\n \"And you just close it down between times?\"\\n\\n \"The embassies are there, the offices of the trading factors, the Fish Speaker schools, the service and maintenance cadres, the museums and libraries.\"\\n\\n \"What space do they take?\" Idaho rapped the chart with his knuckles, \"A tenth of the City at most?\"\\n\\n \"Less than that.\"\\n\\n Idaho let his gaze wander pensively over the chart.\\n\\n \"Are there other purposes in this design, m\u0027Lord?\"\\n\\n \"It is dominated by the need for public viewing of my person.\"\\n\\n \"There must be clerks, government workers, even common laborers. Where do they live?\"\\n\\n \"Mostly in the suburbs.\"\\n\\n Idaho pointed at the chart. \"These tiers of apartments?\"\\n\\n \"Note the balconies, Duncan.\"\\n\\n \"All around the plaza.\" He leaned close to peer down at the chart. \"That plaza is two kilometers across!\"\\n\\n \"Note how the balconies are set back in steps right up to the ring of spires. The elite are lodged in the spires.\"\\n\\n \"And they can all look down on you in the plaza?\"\\n\\n \"You do not like that?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s not even an energy barrier to protect you!\"\\n\\n \"What an inviting target I make.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you do it?\"\\n\\n \"There is a delightful myth about the design of Onn. I foster and promote the myth. It is said that once there lived a people whose ruler was required to walk among them once a year in total darkness, without weapons or armor. The mythical ruler wore a luminescent suit while he made his walk through the night-shrouded throng of his subjects. And his subjects-they wore black for the occasion and were never searched for weapons.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that have to do with Onn... and you?\"\\n\\n \"Well, obviously, if the ruler survived his walk, he was a good ruler.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t search for weapons?\"\\n\\n \"Not openly.\"\\n\\n \"You think people see you in this myth.\" It was not a question.\\n\\n \"Many do.\"\\n\\n Idaho stared up at Leto\u0027s face deep in its gray cowl. The blue-on-blue eyes stared back at him without expression.\\n\\n Melange eyes, Idaho thought. But Leto said he no longer consumed any spice. His body supplied what spice his addiction demanded.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t like my holy obscenity, my enforced tranquility,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like you playing god!\"\\n\\n \"But a god can conduct the Empire as a musical conductor guides a symphony through its movements. My performance is limited only by my restriction to Arrakis. I must direct the symphony from here.\"\\n\\n Idaho shook his head and looked once more at the city plan. \"What\u0027re these apartments behind the spires?\"\\n\\n \"Lesser accommodations for our visitors.\"\\n\\n \"They can\u0027t see the plaza.\"\\n\\n \"But they can. Ixian devices project my image into those rooms.\"\\n\\n \"And the inner ring looks directly down on you. How do you enter the plaza?\"\\n\\n \"A presentation stage rises from the center to display me to my people.\"\\n\\n \"Do they cheer?\" Idaho looked directly into Leto\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n \"They are permitted to cheer.\"\\n\\n \"You Atreides always did see yourselves as part of history.\"\\n\\n \"How astute of you to understand a cheer\u0027s meaning.\"\\n\\n Idaho returned his attention to the city map. \"And the Fish Speaker schools are here?\"\\n\\n \"Under your left hand, yes. That\u0027s the academy where Siona was sent to be educated. She was ten at the time.\"\\n\\n \"Siona... I must learn more about her,\" Idaho mused.\\n\\n \"I assure you that nothing will get in the way of your desire.\"\\n\\n As he marched along in the Royal peregrination, Idaho was lifted from his reverie by awareness that the Fish Speaker chant was diminishing. Ahead of him, the Royal Cart had begun its descent into the chambers beneath the plaza, rolling down a long ramp. Idaho, still in sunlight, looked up and around at the glistening spires-this reality for which the charts had not prepared him. People crowded the balconies of the great tiered ring around the plaza, silent people who stared down at the procession.\\n\\n No cheering from the privileged, Idaho thought. The silence of the people on the balconies filled Idaho with foreboding.\\n\\n He entered the ramp-tunnel and its lip hid the plaza. The Fish Speaker chant faded away as he descended into the depths. The sound of marching feet all around him was curiously amplified.\\n\\n Curiosity replaced the sense of oppressive foreboding. Idaho stared around him. The flat-floored tube was artificially illuminated and wide, very wide. Idaho estimated that seventy people could march abreast into the bowels of the plaza. There were no mobs of greeters here, only a widely spaced line of Fish Speakers who did not chant, contenting themselves to stare at the passage of their God.\\n\\n Memory of the charts told Idaho the layout of this gigantic complex beneath the plaza-a private city within the City, a place where only the God Emperor, the courtiers and the Fish Speakers could go without escort. But the charts had told nothing of the thick pillars, the sense of massive, guarded spaces, the eerie quiet broken by the tramping of feet and the creaking of Leto\u0027s cart.\\n\\n Idaho looked suddenly at the Fish Speakers lining the way and realized that their mouths were moving in unison, a silent word on their lips. He recognized the word:\\n\\n \"Siaynoq.\" -\u003d \"Another Festival so soon?\" the Lord Leto asked.\\n\\n \"It has been ten years,\" the majordomo said.\\n\\n Do you think by this exchange that the Lord Leto betrays an ignorance of time\u0027s passage?\\n\\n - The Oral History DURING THE private audience period preceding the Festival proper, many commented that the God Emperor spent more than the allotted time with the new Ixian Ambassador, a young woman named Hwi Noree.\\n\\n She was brought down at midmorning by two Fish Speakers who were still full of first-day excitement. The private audience chamber beneath the plaza was brilliantly illuminated. The light revealed a room about fifty meters long by thirty-five wide. Antique Fremen rugs decorated the walls, their bright patterns worked in jewels and precious metals, all combined in weavings of priceless spice-fibers. The dull reds of which the Old Fremen had been so fond predominated. The chamber\u0027s floor was mostly transparent, a setting for exotic fishes worked in radiant crystal. Beneath the floor flowed a stream of clear blue water, all of its moisture sealed away from the audience chamber, but excitingly near Leto, who rested on a padded elevation at the end of the room opposite the door.\\n\\n His first view of Hwi Noree revealed a remarkable likeness to her Uncle Malky, but her grave movements and the calmness of her stride were equally remarkable in their difference from Malky. She did have that dark skin, though, the oval face with its regular features. Placid brown eyes stared back at Leto. And where Malky\u0027s hair had been gray, hers was a luminous brown. Hwi Noree radiated an inner peace which Leto sensed spreading its influence around her as she approached. She stopped ten paces away, below him. There was a classical balance about her, something not accidental.\\n\\n With growing excitement, Leto realized a betrayal of lxian machinations in the new Ambassador. They were well along in their own program to breed selected types for specific functions. Hwi Noree\u0027s function was distressingly obvious-to charm the God Emperor, to find a chink in his armor.\\n\\n Despite this, as the meeting progressed, Leto found himself truly enjoying her company. Hwi Noree stood in a puddle of daylight which was guided into the chamber by a system of Ixian prisms. The light filled Leto\u0027s end of the chamber with glowing gold which centered on the Ambassador. dimming behind the God Emperor where stood a short line of Fish Speaker guards-twelve women chosen for their inability to hear or speak.\\n\\n Hwi Noree wore a simple gown of purple ambiel decorated only by a silver necklace pendant stamped with the symbol of IX. Soft sandals the color of her gown peeked from beneath her hem.\\n\\n \"Are you aware,\" Leto asked her, \"that I killed one of your ancestors?\"\\n\\n She smiled softly. \"My Uncle Malky included that information in my early training, Lord.\"\\n\\n As she spoke, Leto realized that part of her education had been conducted by the Bene Gesserit. She had their way of controlling her responses, of sensing the undertones in a conversation. He could see, however, that the Bene Gesserit overlay had been a delicate thing, never penetrating the basic sweetness of her nature.\\n\\n \"You were told that I would introduce this subject,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Yes, Lord. I know that my ancestor had the temerity to bring a weapon here in the attempt to harm you.\"\\n\\n \"As did your immediate predecessor. Were you told that, as well?\"\\n\\n \" I did not learn it until my arrival, Lord. They were fools! Why did you spare my predecessor?\"\\n\\n \"When I did not spare your ancestor?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Lord.\"\\n\\n \"Kobat, your predecessor, was more valuable to me as a messenger.\"\\n\\n \"Then they told me the truth,\" she said. Again -,h.\u003d smiled. \"One cannot always depend on hearing truth from lone\u0027, associates and superiors.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-11.html","bookId":2156,"book":{"id":2156,"title":"God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4) \\n More than three thousand years have passed since the first events recorded in DUNE.
