If they no longer exist, perhaps they can be made to exist again and then perhaps someone will hear them.\" \"Why do you poke fun at me, m\u0027Lord\u0027?\" \"I poke nothing at you except words. I do it without fear of offending because I have learned that you have no ears.\" \"I don\u0027t understand you, m\u0027Lord.\" \"That is the beginning of knowledge-the discovery of something we do not understand.\" Before Idaho could respond, Leto gave a hand signal to a nearby guard who waved a hand in front of a crystalline control panel on the wall behind the God Emperor\u0027s dais. A three-dimensional view of Nunepi\u0027s punishment appeared in the center of the chamber.Idaho stepped down to the floor of the chamber and peered closely at the scene. It was shown from a slight elevation looking down on the plaza, and was complete with sounds of the swelling throng who had run to the scene at the first signs of excitement. Nunepi was bound to two legs of a tripod, his feet spread wide, his arms tied together above him almost at the apex of the tripod. His clothing had been ripped from his body and lay around him in rags. A bulky, masked Fish Speaker stood nearby holding an improvised whip fashioned of elacca rope which had been frayed at the end into wire-like fine strands. Idaho thought he recognized the masked woman as the Friend of his first interview. At a signal from a Guard officer, the masked Fish Speaker stepped forward and brought the elacca whip down in a slashing arc onto Nunepi\u0027s exposed back. Idaho winced. The crowd gasped. Welts appeared where the whip had struck, but Nunepi remained silent. Again, the whip descended. Blood betrayed the lines of this second stroke. Once more, the whip flayed Nunepi\u0027s back. More blood appeared. Leto felt remote sadness. Nayla is too ardent, he thought. She will kill him and that will cause problems. \"Duncan!\" Leto called. Idaho turned from his fascinated examination of the projected scene just as a shout lifted from the crowd-response to a particularly bloody stroke. \"Send someone to stop the flogging after twenty lashes,\"\u0027 Leto said. \"Have it announced that the magnanimity of the God Emperor has reduced the punishment.\" Idaho raised a hand to one of the guards, who nodded and ran from the chamber. \"Come here, Duncan,\" Leto said. Still smarting under what he believed was Leto\u0027s poking fun at him, Idaho returned to Leto\u0027s side. \"Whatever I do,\" Leto said, \"it is to teach a lesson.\" Idaho rigidly willed himself not to look back at the scene of Nunepi\u0027s punishment. Was that the sound of Nunepi groaning? The shouts of the crowd pierced Idaho. He stared up into Leto\u0027s eyes. \"There is a question in your mind,\" Leto said. \"Many questions, m\u0027Lord.\" \"Speak them.\" \"What is the lesson in that fool\u0027s punishment? What do we say when asked?\" \"We say that no one is permitted to blaspheme against the God Emperor.\" \"A bloody lesson, m\u0027Lord.\" \"Not as bloody as some I\u0027ve taught.\" Idaho shook his head from side to side in obvious dismay. \"Nothing good\u0027s going to come of this!\" \"Precisely!\" -\u003d Safaris through ancestral memories teach me many things. The patterns, ahhh, the patterns Liberal bigots are the ones who trouble me most. I distrust the extremes. Scratch a conservative and you find someone who prefers the past over any future. Scratch a liberal and find a closet aristocrat. It\u0027s true! Liberal governments always develop into aristocracies The bureaucracies betray the true intent of people who form such governments. Right from the first, the little people who formed the governments which promised to equalize the social burdens found themselves suddenly in the hands of bureaucratic aristocracies. Of course, all bureaucracies follow this pattern. but what a hypocrisy to find this even under a communized banner Ahhh, well, if patterns teach me anything it\u0027s that patterns are repeated. My oppressions. by and large, are no worse than any of the others and, at least. I teach a new lesson. - The Stolen Journals T was well into the darkness of Audience Day before Leto could meet with the Bene Gesserit delegation. Moneo had prepared the Reverend Mothers for the delay, repeating the God Emperor\u0027s reassurances. Reporting back to his Emperor, Moneo had said: \"They expect a rich reward.\" \"We shall see,\" Leto had said. \"We shall see. Now, tell me what it was the Duncan demanded of you as you entered.\" \"He wished to know if you had ever before had someone flogged.\" \"And you replied?\" \"That there was no record of, nor had I ever before witnessed, such a punishment.\" \"His response?\" \"This is not Atreides.\" \"Does he think I\u0027m insane?\" \"He did not say that.\" \"There was more to your encounter. What else troubles our new Duncan?\" \"He has met the Ixian Ambassador, Lord. He find Hwi Noree attractive. He inquired of...\" \"That must be prevented, Moneo! I trust you to raise barriers against any liaison between the Duncan and Hwi.\" \"My Lord commands.\" \"Indeed I do! Go now and prepare for our meeting with the women of the Bene Gesserit. I will receive them at False Sietch.\" \"Lord, is there significance in this choice of a meeting place?\" \"A whim. On your way out, tell the Duncan he may take out a troop of guards and scour the City for trouble.\" Waiting for the Bene Gesserit delegation at False Sietch, Leto reviewed this exchange, finding some amusement in it. He could imagine the reactions through the Festival City at the approach of a disturbed Duncan Idaho in command of a Fish Speaker troop. Like the quick silence of frogs when a predator comes. Now that he was in False Sietch, Leto found himself pleased by the choice. A free-form building of irregular domes at the edge of Onn, False Sietch was almost a kilometer across. It had been the first abode of the Museum Fremen and now was their school, its corridors and chambers patrolled by alert Fish Speakers. The reception hall where Leto waited, an oval about two hundred meters in its long dimension, was illuminated by giant glowglobes which floated in blue-green isolation some thirty meters above the floor. The light muted the dull browns and tans of the imitation stone from which the entire structure had been fashioned. Leto waited on a low ledge at one end of the chamber, looking outward through a half-circle window longer than his body. The opening, four stories above the ground, framed a view which included a remnant of the ancient Shield Wall preserved for its cliff-side caves where Atreides troops had once been slaughtered by Harkonnen attackers. The frosty light of First Moon silvered the cliff\u0027s outlines. Fires dotted the cliff-side, the flames exposed where no Fremen would have dared betray his presence. The fires winked at Leto as people passed in front of them-Museum Fremen exercising their right to occupy the sacred precincts. Museum Fremen! Leto thought. \u0027They were such narrow thinkers with near horizons. But why should I object? They are what l made them. Leto heard the Bene Gesserit delegation then. They chanted as they approached, a heavy sound all a-jostle with vowels. Moneo preceded them with a guard detail which took up position on Leto\u0027s ledge. Moneo stood on the chamber floor just below Leto\u0027s face, glanced at Leto. turned to the open hall. The women entered in a double file, ten of them led by two Reverend Mothers in traditional black robes. \"That is Anteac on the left, Luyseyal on the right,\" Moneo said. The names recalled for Leto the earlier words about the Reverend Mothers brought in by Moneo, agitated and distrustful. Moneo did not like the witches. \"They\u0027re both Truthsayers,\" Moneo had said. \"Anteac is much older than Luyseyal, but the latter is reputed to be the best Truthsayer the Bene Gesserit have. You may note that Anteac has a scar on her forehead whose origin we have been unable to discover. Luyseyal has red hair and appears remarkably young for one of her reputation.\" As he watched the Reverend Mothers approach with their entourage, Leto felt the quick surge of his memories. The women wore their hoods forward, shrouding their faces. The attendants and acolytes walked at a respectful distance behind... it was all of a piece. Some patterns did not change. These women might have been entering a real sietch with real Fremen here to honor them. Their heads know what their bodies deny, he thought. Leto\u0027s penetrating vision saw the subservient caution in their eyes, but they strode up the long chamber like people confident of their religious power. It pleased Leto to think that the Bene Gesserit possessed only such powers as he permitted. The reasons for this indulgence were clear to him. Of all the people in his Empire, Reverend Mothers were most like him-limited to the memories of only their female ancestors and the collateral female identities of their inheritance ritual-still, each of them did exist as somewhat of an integrated mob. The Reverend Mothers came to a stop at the required ten paces from Leto\u0027s ledge. The entourage spread out on each side. It amused Leto to greet such delegations in the voice and persona of his grandmother, Jessica. The Bene Gesserit had come to expect this and he did not disappoint them. \"Welcome, Sisters,\" he said. The voice was a smooth contralto, definitely Jessica\u0027s controlled feminine tones with just a hint of mockery-a voice recorded and often studied in the Sisterhood\u0027s Chapter House. As he spoke, Leto sensed menace. Reverend Mothers were never pleased when he greeted them this way, but the reaction here carried different undertones. Moneo, too, sensed it. He raised n finger and the guards moved closer to Leto. Anteac spoke first: \"Lord, we watched that display in the plaza this morning. What do you gain by such antics?\" So that\u0027s the tone we wish to set, he thought. Speaking in his own voice, he said: \"You are temporarily in my good graces. Would you change that?\" \"Lord,\" Anteac said, \"we are shocked that you could thus punish an Ambassador. We do not understand what you gain by this.\" \"I gain nothing. I am diminishes:.\" Luyseyal spoke up: \"This can only reinforce thoughts of oppression.\" \"I wonder why so few ever thought of the Bene Gesserit as oppressors?\" Leto asked. Anteac spoke to her companion: \"If it pleases the God Emperor to inform us, he will do so. Let us get to the purposes of our Embassy.\" Leto smiled. \"The two of you can come closer. Leave your attendants and approach.\" Moneo stepped two paces to his right as the Reverend Mothers moved in characteristic silent gliding to within three paces of the ledge. \"It\u0027s almost as though they had no feet:\" Moneo had once complained. Recalling this, Leto observed how carefully Moneo watched the two women. They were menacing, but Moneo dared not object to their nearness. The God Emperor had ordered it; thus it would be. Leto lifted his attention to the attendants waiting where the Bene Gesserit entourage had first stopped. The acolytes wore hoodless black gowns. He saw tiny clues to forbidden rituals about them-an amulet, a small trinket, a colorful corner of a kerchief so arranged that more color might be flashed carefully. Leto knew that the Reverend Mothers allowed this because they no longer could share the spice as once they had. Ritual substitutes. There were significant changes across the past ten years. A new parsimony had entered the Sisterhood\u0027s thinking. They are coming out, Leto told himself. The old, old mysteries are still here. The ancient patterns had lain dormant in the Bene Gesserit memories for all of those millennia. Now, they emerge. I must warn my Fish Speakers. He returned his attention to the Reverend Mothers. \"You have requests?\" \"What is it like to be you\u0027?\" Luyseyal asked. Leto blinked. That was an interesting attack. They had not tried it in more than a generation. Well... why not? \"Sometimes my dreams are blocked off and redirected into strange places,\" he said. \"If my cosmic memories are a web, as you two certainly know, then think about the dimensions of my web and where such memories and dreams might lead.\" \"You speak of our certain knowledge,\" Anteac said, \"Why can\u0027t we join forces at last\u0027? We are more alike than we are different.\" \"I would sooner link myself to those degenerate Great Houses bewailing their lost spice riches\u0027.\" Anteac held herself still, but Luyseyal pointed a finger at Leto. \"We offer community!\" \"And I insist on conflict?\" Anteac stirred, then: \"It is said that there is a principle of conflict which originated with the single cell and has never deteriorated.\" \"Some things remain incompatible,\" Leto agreed. \"Then how does our Sisterhood maintain its community?\" Luyseyal demanded. Leto hardened his voice. \"As you well know, the secret of community lies in suppression of the incompatible.\" \"There can be enormous value in cooperation,\" Anteac said. \"To you, not to me.\" Anteac contrived a sigh. \"Then, Lord, will you tell us about the physical changes in your person?\" \"Someone besides yourself should know about and record such things,\" Luyseyal said. \"In case something dreadful should happen to me?\" Leto asked. \"Lord!\" Anteac protested. \"We do not...\" \"You dissect me with words when you would prefer sharper instruments,\" Leto said. \"Hypocrisy offends me.\" \"We protest, Lord,\" Anteac said. \"Indeed you do. I hear you.\" Luyseyal crept a few millimeters closer to the ledge, bringing a sharp stare from Moneo, who glanced up at Leto then. Moneo\u0027s expression demanded action, but Leto ignored him, curious now about Luyseyal\u0027s intentions. The sense of menace was centered in the red-haired one. What is she? Leto wondered. Could she be a Face Dancer, after all? No. None of the telltale signs were there. No. Luyseyal presented an elaborately relaxed appearance, not even a little twist of her features to test the God Emperor\u0027s powers of observation. \"Will you not tell us about your physical changes, Lord?\" Anteac asked. Diversion! Leto thought. \"My brain grows enormous,\" he said. \"Most of the human skull has dissolved away. There are no severe limits to the growth of my cortex and its attendant nervous system.\" Moneo darted a startled glance at Leto. Why was the God Emperor giving away such vital information? These two would trade it. But both women were obviously fascinated by this revelation, hesitating in whatever plan they had evolved. \"Does your brain have a center?\" Luyseyal asked. \"I am the center,\" Leto said. \"A location?\" Anteac asked. She gestured vaguely at him. Luyseyal glided a few millimeters closer to the ledge. \"What value do you place on the things I reveal to you?\" Leto asked. The two women betrayed no change of expression, which was betrayal enough by itself. A smile flirted across Leto\u0027s lips. \"The marketplace has captured you,\" he said. \"Even the Bene Gesserit has been infected by the suk mentality.\" \"We do not deserve that accusation,-\" Anteac said. \"But you do. The suk mentality dominates my Empire. The uses of the market have only been sharpened and amplified by the demands of our times. We have all become traders.\" \"Even you, Lord?\" Luyseyal asked. \"You tempt my wrath,\" he said. \"You\u0027re a specialist in that, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Lord?\" Luyseyal\u0027s voice was calm, but overly controlled. \"Specialists are not to be trusted,\" Leto said. \"Specialists are masters of exclusion, experts in the narrow.\" \"We hope to be architects of a better future.\" Anteac said. \"Better than what?\" Leto asked. Luyseyal eased herself a fractional pace closer to Leto. \"We hope to set our standards by your judgment, Lord,\" Anteac said. \"But you would be architects. Would you build higher walls? Never forget, Sisters, that I know you. You are efficient purveyors of blinders.\" \"Life continues, Lord,\" Anteac said, \"Indeed? And so does the universe.\" Luyseyal eased herself a bit closer, ignoring the fixity of Moneo\u0027s attention. Leto smelled it then and almost laughed aloud. Spice-essence! They had brought some spice-essence. They knew the old stories about sandworms and spice-essence, of course. Luyseyal carried it. She thought of it as a specific poison for sandworms. That was obvious. Bene Gesserit records and the Oral History agreed on this. The essence shattered the worm, precipitating its dissolution and resulting (eventually) in sandtrout which would produce more sandworms etcetera, etcetera, etcetera... \"There is another change in me that you should know about,\" Leto said. \"I am not yet sandworm, not fully. Think of me as something closer to a colony creature with sensory alterations.\" Luyseyal\u0027s left hand moved almost imperceptibly toward a fold in her gown. Moneo saw it and looked to Leto for instructions, but Leto only returned the hooded glare of Luyseyal\u0027s eyes. \"There have been fads in smells,\" Leto said. Luyseyal\u0027s hand hesitated. \"Perfumes and essences,\" he said. \" I remember them all, even the cults of the non-smells are mine. People have used underarm sprays and crotch sprays to mask their natural odors. Did you know that? Of course you knew it!\" Anteac\u0027s gaze moved toward Luyseyal. Neither woman dared speak. \"People knew instinctively that their pheromones betrayed them,\" Leto said. The women stood immobile. They heard him. Of all his people, Reverend Mothers were best equipped to understand his hidden message. \"You\u0027d like to mine me for my riches of memory,\" Leto said, his voice accusing. \"We are jealous, Lord,\" Luyseyal confessed. \"You have misread the history of spice-essence,\" Leto said. \"Sandtrout sense it only as water.\" \"It was a test, Lord,\" Anteac said. \"That is all.\" \"You would test me?\" \"Blame our curiosity, Lord,\" Anteac said. \"I, too, am curious. Put your spice-essence on the ledge beside Moneo. I will keep it.\" Slowly, demonstrating by the steadiness of her movements that she intended no attack, Luyseyal reached beneath her gown and removed a small vial which glistened with an inner blue radiance. She placed the vial gently on the ledge. Not by any sign did she indicate that she might try something desperate. \"Truthsayer, indeed,\" Leto said. She favored him with a faint grimace which might have been a smile, then withdrew to Anteac\u0027s side. \"Where did you get the spice-essence?\" Leto asked. \"We bought it from smugglers,\" Anteac said. \"There\u0027ve been no smugglers for almost twenty-five hundred years.\" \"Waste not, want not,\" Anteac said. \" I see. And now you must reevaluate what you think of as your own patience, is that not so?\" \"We have been watching the evolution of your body, Lord,\" Anteac said. \"We thought...\" She permitted herself a small shrug, the level of gesture warranted for use with a Sister and not given lightly. Leto pursed his lips in response. \"I cannot shrug,\" he said. \"Will you punish us?\" Luyseyal asked. \"For amusing me?\" Luyseyal glanced at the vial on the ledge. \"I swore to reward you,\" Leto said. \" shall.\" \"We would prefer to protect you in our community, Lord,\" Anteac said. \"Do not seek too great a reward,\" he said. Anteac nodded. \"You deal with the lxians, Lord. We have reason to believe they may venture against you.\" \"I fear them no more than I fear you.\" \"Surely you\u0027ve heard what the lxians are doing,\" Luyseyal said. \"Moneo brings me an occasional copy of a message between persons or groups in my Empire. I hear many stories.\" \"We speak of a new Abomination, Lord\"\u0027 Anteac said. \"You think the lxians can produce an artificial intelligence?\" he asked. \"Conscious the way you are conscious?\" \"We fear it, Lord,\" Anteac said. \"You would have me believe that the Butlerian Jihad survives among the Sisterhood?\" \"We do not trust the unknown which can arise from imaginative technology,\" Anteac said. Luyseyal leaned toward him. \"The lxians boast that their machine will transcend Time in the way that you do it, Lord.\" \"And the Guild says there\u0027s Time-chaos around the lxians,\u0027* Leto mocked. \"Are we to fear all creation, then?\" Anteac drew herself up stiffly. \" I speak truth with you two,\" Leto said. \" I recognize your abilities. Will you not recognize mine?\" Luyseyal gave him a curt nod. \"Tleilax and Ix make alliance with the Guild and seek our full cooperation.\" \"And you fear Ix the most?\" \"We fear anything we do not control,\" Anteac said. \"And you do not control me.\" \"Without you, people would need us!\" Anteac said. \"Truth at last!\" Leto said. \"You conic to me as your Oracle and you ask me to put your fears to rest.\" Anteac\u0027s voice was frigidly controlled. \"Will Ix make a mechanical brain?\" \"A brain`? Of course not!\" Luyseyal appeared to relax, but Anteac remained unmoving. She was not satisfied with the Oracle. Why is it that foolishness repeats itself with such monotonous precision? Leto wondered. His memories offered up countless scenes to match this one-caverns, priests and priestesses caught up in holy ecstasy, portentous voices delivering dangerous prophecies through the smoke of holy narcotics. He glanced down at the iridescent vial on the ledge beside Moneo. What was the current value of that thing`? Enormous. It was the essence. Concentrated wealth concentrated. \"You have already paid the Oracle,\" he said. \"It amuses me to give you full value.\" How alert the women became!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-13.html","bookId":2156,"book":{"id":2156,"title":"God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4) More than three thousand years have passed since the first events recorded in DUNE.
