That is why we worship you and...\" \"Damn you, Moneo!\" Moneo jerked his head up and stared at Leto in terror. \"Civilizations collapse when their powers outrun their religions!\" Leto said. \"Why can\u0027t you see this? Hwi does.\" \"She is Ixian, Lord. Perhaps she...\" \"She\u0027s a Fish Speaker! She has been from birth, born to serve me. No!\" Leto raised one of his tiny hands as Moneo tried to speak. \"The Fish Speakers are disturbed because I called them my brides, and now they see a stranger not trained in Siaynoq who knows it better than they.\" \"How can that be, Lord, when your Fish...\" \"What are you saying? Each of us comes into being knowing who he is and what he is supposed to do.\" Moneo opened his mouth but closed it without speaking. \"Small children know,\" Leto said. \"It\u0027s only after adults have confused them that children hide this knowledge even from themselves. Moneo! Uncover yourself!\" \"Lord, I cannot!\" The words were torn from Moneo. He trembled with anguish. \"I do not have your powers, your knowledge of...\" \"Enough!\" Moneo fell silent. His body shook. Leto spoke soothingly to him. \"It\u0027s all right, Moneo. I asked too much of you and I can see your fatigue.\" Slowly, Moneo\u0027s trembling subsided. He drew in deep, gulping breaths. Leto said: \"There will be some change in my Fremen wedding. We will not use the water rings of my sister, Ghanima. We will use, instead, the rings of my mother.\" \"The Lady Chani, Lord? But where are her rings?\" Leto twisted his bulk on the cart and pointed to the intersection of two cavernous spokes on his left where the dim light revealed the earliest burial niches of the Atreides on Arrakis. \"In her tomb, the first niche. You will remove those rings, Moneo, and bring them to the ceremony.\" Moneo stared across the gloomy distance of the crypt. \"Lord... is it not a desecration to...\" \"You forget, Moneo, who lives in me.\" He spoke then in Chani\u0027s voice: \"I can do what I want with my water rings!\" Moneo cowered. \"Yes, Lord. I will bring them with me to Tabur Village when...\" \"Tabur Village?\" Leto asked in his usual voice. \"But I have changed my mind. We will be wed at Tuono Village!\" Most civilization is based on cowardice. It\u0027s so easy to civilize by teaching cowardice. You water down the standards which would lead to bravery. You restrain the will. You regulate the appetites. You fence in the horizons. You make a law for every movement. You deny the existence of chaos. You teach even the children to breathe slowly. You tame. The Stolen Journals IDAHO STOOD aghast at his first close glimpse of Tuono Village. That was the home of Fremen? The Fish Speaker troop had taken them from the Citadel at daybreak, Idaho and Siona bundled into a large ornithopter, accompanied by two smaller guard ships. And the flight had been slow, almost three hours. They had landed at a flat, round plastone hangar almost a kilometer from the village, separated from it by old dunes locked in shape with plantings of poverty grasses and a few scrubby bushes. As they came down, the wall directly behind the village had seemed to grow taller and taller, the village shrinking beneath such immensity. \"The Museum Fremen are kept generally uncontaminated by off-planet technology,\" Nayla had explained as the escort sealed the \u0027thopters into the low hangar. One of the troop already had been sent trotting off toward Tuono with the announcement of their arrival. Siona had remained mostly silent all during the flight, but she had studied Nayla with covert intensity. For a time during the march across the morning-lighted dunes, Idaho had tried to imagine that he was back in the old days. Sand was visible in the plantings and, in the valleys between dunes, there was parched ground, yellow grass, the sticklike shrubs. Three vultures, their gap-tipped wings spread wide, circled in the vault of sky-\"the soaring search,\" Fremen had called it. Idaho had tried to explain this to Siona walking beside him. You worried about the carrion-eaters only when they began to descend. \"I have been told about vultures,\" she said, her voice cold. Idaho had noted the perspiration on her upper lip. There was a spicy smell of sweat in the troop pressed close around them. His imagination was not equal to the task of defocusing the differences between the past and this time. The issue stillsuits they wore were more for show than for efficient collection of the body\u0027s water. No true Fremen would have trusted his life to one of them, not even here, where the air smelled of nearby water. And the Fish Speakers of Nayla\u0027s troop did not walk in Fremen silence. They chattered among themselves like children. Siona trudged beside him in sullen withdrawal, her attention frequently on the broad muscular back of Nayla, who strode along a few paces ahead of the troop. What was between those two women? Idaho wondered. Nayla appeared devoted to Siona, hanging on Siona\u0027s every word, obeying every whim Siona uttered... except that Nayla would not deviate from the orders which brought them to Tuono Village. Still, Nayla deferred to Siona and called her \"Commander.\" There was something deep between those two, something which aroused awe and fear in Nayla. They came at last to a slope which dropped down to the village and the wall behind it. From the air, Tuono had been a cluster of glittering rectangles just outside the shadow of the wall. From this close vantage, though, it had been reduced to a cluster of decaying huts made even more pitiful by attempts to decorate the place. Bits of shiny minerals and scraps of metal picked out scroll designs on the building walls. A tattered green banner fluttered from a metal pole atop the largest structure. A fitful breeze brought the smell of garbage and uncovered cesspools to Idaho\u0027s nostrils. The central street of the village extended out across the sparsely planted sand toward the troop, ending in a ragged edge of broken paving. A robed delegation waited near the building of the green flag, standing there expectantly with the Fish Speaker messenger Nayla had sent on ahead. Idaho counted eight in the delegation, all men in what appeared to be authentic Fremen robes of dark brown. A green headband could be glimpsed beneath the hood on one of the delegation-the Naib, no doubt. Children waited to one side with flowers. Black-hooded women could be seen peering from side-streets in the background. Idaho found the whole scene distressing. \"Let\u0027s get it over with,\" Siona said. Nayla nodded and led the way down the slope onto the street. Siona and Idaho stayed a few paces behind her. The rest of the troop straggled along after them, silent now and peering around with undisguised curiosity. As Nayla neared the delegation, the one with the green headband stepped forward and bowed. He moved like an old man but Idaho saw that he was not old, barely into his middle years, the cheeks smooth and unwrinkled, a stubby nose with no scars from breath-filter tubes, and the eyes! The eyes revealed definite pupils, not the all-blue of spice addiction. They were brown eyes. Brown eyes in a Fremen! \"I am Garun,\" the man said as Nayla stopped in front of him. \"I am Naib of this place. I give you a Fremen welcome to Tuono.\" Nayla gestured over her shoulder at Siona and Idaho, who had stopped just behind her. \"Are quarters prepared for your guests?\" \"We Fremen are noted for our hospitality,\" Garun said. \"All is ready.\" Idaho sniffed at the sour smells and sounds of this place. He glanced through open windows of the flag-topped building on his right. The Atreides banner flying over that? The window opened into an auditorium with low ceiling, a band-shell at the far end enclosing a small platform. He saw rows of seats, maroon carpeting on the floor. It had all the look of a stage setting, a place to entertain tourists. The sound of shuffling feet brought Idaho\u0027s attention back to Garun. Children were pressing forward around the delegation, extending clumps of garish red flowers in their grimy hands. The flowers were wilted. Garun addressed himself to Siona, correctly identifying the gold piping of Fish Speaker Command in her uniform. \"Will you wish a performance of our Fremen rituals?\" he asked. \"The music, perhaps? The dance?\" Nayla accepted a bunch of flowers from one of the children, sniffed them and sneezed. Another urchin extended flowers toward Siona, lifting a wide-eyed stare toward her. She accepted the flowers without looking at the child. Idaho merely waved the children aside as they approached him. They hesitated, staring up at him, then scurried around him toward the rest of the troop. Garun spoke to Idaho. \"If you give them a few coins, they will not bother you.\" Idaho shuddered. Was this the training for Fremen children? Garun returned his attention to Siona. With Nayla listening, Garun began explaining the layout of his village. Idaho moved away from them down the street, noting how glances flicked toward him and then avoided his gaze. He felt deeply offended by the surface decorations on the buildings, none of it disguising the evidence of decay. He stared in an open doorway at the auditorium. There was a harshness in Tuono, a struggling something behind the wilting flowers and the servile tone of Garun\u0027s voice. In another time and on another planet, this would have been a donkey-in-the-street village rope-belted peasants pressing forward with petitions. He could hear the whine of supplication in Garun\u0027s voice. These were not Fremen! These poor creatures lived on the margins, trying to retain parts of an ancient wholeness. And all the while, that lost reality slipped farther and farther from their grasp. What had Leto created here? These Museum Fremen were lost to everything except a bare existence and the rote mouthing of old words which they did not understand and which they did not even pronounce correctly! Returning to Siona, Idaho bent to study the cut of Garun\u0027s brown robe, seeing a tightness in it dictated by a need to conserve fabric. The gray slick of a stillsuit could be seen underneath, exposed to sunlight which no real Fremen would ever have let touch his stillsuit that way. Idaho looked at the rest of the delegation, noting an identical parsimonious treatment of fabric. It betrayed their emotional bent. Such garments allowed no expansive gestures, no freedom of movement. The robes were tight and confining in the way of these entire people! Disgust propelling him, Idaho strode forward abruptly and parted Garun\u0027s robe to look at the stillsuit. Just as he suspected! The suit was another sham-no arms to it, no boot-pumps! Garun pulled back, putting a hand to the knife hilt Idaho had exposed at the man\u0027s belt. \"Here! What\u0027re you doing?\" Garun demanded, his voice querulous. \"You don\u0027t touch a Fremen thus!\" \"You, a Fremen?\" Idaho demanded. \"I lived with Fremen! I fought by their sides against Harkonnens! I died with Fremen! You? You\u0027re a sham!\" Garun\u0027s knuckles went white on the knife haft. He addressed himself to Siona. \"Who is this man?\" Nayla spoke up: \"This is Duncan Idaho.\" \"The ghola?\" Garun turned to look at Idaho\u0027s face. \"We have never seen your like here before.\" Idaho felt himself almost overcome with desire to cleanse this place even if it cost him his life, this diminished life which could be repeated endlessly by people who had no real concerns for him. An older model, yes! But this was no Fremen. \"Draw that knife or take your hand off it,\" Idaho said. Garun jerked his hand away from the knife. \"It is not a real knife,\" he said. \"Only for decoration.\" His voice became eager. \"But we have real knives, even crysknives! They are kept locked in the display cases to preserve them.\" Idaho could not help himself. He threw his head back in laughter. Siona smiled, but Nayla looked thoughtful and the rest of the Fish Speaker troop drew into a close, watchful circle around them. The laughter had an odd effect on Garun. He lowered his head and clasped his hands tightly together, but not before Idaho saw them trembling. When Garun peered upward once more, it was to look at Idaho from beneath heavy brows. Idaho felt abruptly sobered. It was as though some terrible boot had crushed Garun\u0027s ego into fearful subservience. There was watchful waiting in the man\u0027s eyes. And for no reason he could explain, Idaho remembered a passage from the Orange Catholic Bible. He asked himself: Are these the meek who will outwait us all and inherit the universe? Garun cleared his throat, then: \"Perhaps the ghola Duncan Idaho will witness our ways and our ritual and judge them?\" Idaho felt shamed by the plaintive request. He spoke without thinking: \"I will teach you anything Fremen that I know.\" He looked up to see Nayla scowling at him. \"It will help to pass the time,\" he said. \"And who knows? It may return something of the true Fremen to this land.\" Siona said: \"We\u0027ve no need to play old cultish games! Take us to our quarters.\" Nayla lowered her head in embarrassment and spoke without looking at Siona. \"Commander, there is a thing I have not ventured to tell you.\" \"That you must make sure we stay in this filthy place,\" Siona said. \"Oh, no!\" Nayla looked up at Siona\u0027s face. \"Where could you go? The Wall cannot be climbed and there is only the river beyond it, anyway. And in the other direction, it is the Sareer. Oh, no... it is something else.\" Nayla shook her head. \"Out with it!\" Siona snapped. \"I am under the strictest orders, Commander, which I dare not disobey.\" Nayla glanced at the other members of the troop then back to Siona. \"You and the... Duncan Idaho are to be quartered together.\" \"My father\u0027s orders?\" \"Lady Commander, they are said to be the orders of the God Emperor himself and we dare not disobey.\" Siona looked full at Idaho. \"You will remember my warning, Duncan, when last we spoke at the Citadel?\" \"My hands are mine to do with as I wish,\" Idaho snarled. \"I don\u0027t think you have any doubts about my wishes!\" She turned away from him after a curt nod and looked at Garun. \"What does it matter where we bed in this disgusting place? Take us to our quarters.\" Idaho found Garun\u0027s response fascinating-a turning of the head toward the ghola, shielding the face behind the Fremen hood, then a secret conspiratorial wink. Only then did Garun lead them away down the ditty street. -\u003d What is the most immediate danger to my stewardship? I will tell you. It is a true visionary, a person who has stood in the presence of God with the full knowledge of where he stands. Visionary ecstasy releases energies which are like the energies of sex-uncaring for anything except creation. One act of creation can be much like another. Everything depends upon the vision. - The Stolen Journals LETO LAY without his cart on the high, sheltered balcony of his Little Citadel tower, subduing a fretfulness which he knew came from the necessary delays putting off the date of his wedding to Hwi Noree. He stared toward the southwest. Somewhere off there beyond the darkening horizon, the Duncan, Siona and their companions had been six days in Tuono Village. The delays are my own fault, Leto thought. I am the one who changed the place for the wedding, making it necessary for poor Moneo to revise all of his preparations. And now, of course, there was the matter of Malky. None of these necessities could be explained to Moneo, who could be heard stirring about within the central chamber of the aerie, worrying about his absence from the command post where he directed the festive preparations. Moneo was such a worrier! Leto looked toward the setting sun. It floated low to the horizon, faded a dim orange by a recent storm. Rain crouched low in the clouds to the south beyond the Sareer now. In a prolonged silence, Leto had watched the rain there for a time which had stretched out with no beginning or end. The clouds had grown out of a hard gray sky, rain walking in visible lines. He had felt himself clothed in memories that came unbidden. The mood was hard to shake off and, without even thinking, he muttered the remembered lines of an ancient verse. \"Did you speak, Lord?\" Moneo\u0027s voice came from close beside Leto. By merely turning his eyes, Leto could see the faithful majordomo standing attentively waiting. Leto translated into Galach as he quoted: \"The nightingale nests in the plum tree, but what will she do with the wind?\" \"Is that a question, Lord?\" \"An old question. The answer is simple. Let the nightingale keep to her flowers.\" \"I don\u0027t understand, Lord.\" \"Stop mouthing the obvious, Moneo. It disturbs me when you do that.\" \"Forgive me, Lord.\" \"What else can I do?\" Leto studied Moneo\u0027s downcast features. \"You and I, Moneo, whatever else we do, we provide good theater.\" Moneo peered at Leto\u0027s face. \"Lord?\" \"The rites of the religious festival of Bacchus were the seeds of Greek theater, Moneo. Religion often leads to theater. They will have fine theater out of us.\" Once more, Leto turned and looked at the southwest horizon. There was a wind there now piling up the clouds. Leto thought he could hear driven sand blustering along the dunes, but there was only resonant quiet in the tower aerie, a quiet with the faintest of wind hiss behind it. \"The clouds,\" he whispered. \"I would take a cup of moonlight once more, an ancient sea barge at my feet, thin clouds clinging to my darkling sky, the blue-gray cloak around my shoulders and horses neighing nearby.\" \"My Lord is troubled,\" Moneo said. The compassion in his voice wrenched at Leto. \"The bright shadows of my pasts,\" Leto said. \"They never leave me in peace. I listened for a soothing sound, the bell of a country town at nightfall, and it told me only that I am the sound and soul of this place.\" As he spoke, darkness enclosed the tower. Automatic lights came on around them. Leto kept his attention directed outward where a thin melon slice of First Moon drifted above the clouds with orange planet-light revealing the satellite\u0027s full circle. \"Lord, why have we come out here?\" Moneo asked. \"Why won\u0027t you tell me?\" \"I wanted the benefit of your surprise,\" Leto said. \"A Guild lighter will land beside us out here soon. My Fish Speakers bring Malky to me.\" Moneo inhaled a quick breath and held it a moment before exhaling. \"Hwi\u0027s... uncle? That Malky?\" \"You are surprised that you had no warning of this,\" Leto said. Moneo felt a chill all through his body. \"Lord, when you wish to keep things secret from...\" \"Moneo?\" Leto spoke in a softly persuasive tone. \"I know that Malky offered you greater temptations than any other...\" \"Lord! I never...\" \"I know that, Moneo.\" Still in that soft tone. \"But surprise has shocked your memories alive. You are armed for anything I may require of you.\" \"What... what does my Lord...\" \"Perhaps we will have to dispose of Malky. He is a problem.\" \"Me? You want me to...\" \"Perhaps.\" Moneo swallowed, then, \"The Reverend Mother...\" \"Anteac is dead. She served me well, but she is dead. There was extreme violence when my Fish Speakers attacked the... place where Malky lay hidden.\" \"We are better off without Anteac,\" Moneo said. \"I appreciate your distrust of the Bene Gesserit, but I would that Anteac had left us in another way. She was faithful to us, Moneo.\" \"A Reverend Mother was...\" \"Both the Bene Tleilax and the Guild wanted Malky\u0027s secret,\" Leto said. \"When they saw us move against the lxians, they struck ahead of my Fish Speakers. Anteac... well, she could only delay them a bit, but it was enough. My Fish Speakers invested the place...\" \"Malky\u0027s secret, Lord?\" \"When a thing vanishes,\" Leto said, \"that is as much of a message as when a thing suddenly appears. The empty spaces are always worthy of our study.\" \"What does my Lord mean, empty...\" \"Malky did not die! Certainly I would have known that. Where did he go when he vanished?\" \"Vanished... from you, Lord? Do you mean that the lxians...\" \"They have improved upon a device they gave me long ago. They improved it slowly and subtly, hidden shells within hidden shells, but I noted the shadows. I was surprised. I was pleased.\" Moneo thought about this. A device which concealed... Ahhh! The God Emperor had mentioned a thing on several occasions, a way of concealing the thoughts he recorded. Moneo spoke: \"And Malky brings the secret of...\" \"Oh, yes! But that is not Malky\u0027s real secret. He holds another thing in his bosom which he does not think that I suspect.\" \"Another... but, Lord, if they can hide even from you...\" \"Many can do that now, Moneo. They scattered when my Fish Speakers attacked. The secret of the lxian device is spread far and wide.\" Moneo\u0027s eyes went wide with alarm. \"Lord, if anyone...\" \"If they learn to be clever, they will leave no tracks,\" Leto said. \"Tell me, Moneo, what does Nayla say about the Duncan? Does she resent reporting directly to you?\" \"Whatever my Lord commands...\" Moneo cleared his throat. He could not fathom why his God Emperor spoke of hidden tracks, the Duncan and Nayla in the same breath. \"Yes, of course,\" Leto said. \"Whatever I command, Nayla obeys. And what does she say of the Duncan?\" \"He has not tried to breed with Siona, if that is my Lord\u0027s... \"But what does he do with my puppet Naib, Garun, and the other Museum Fremen?\" \"He speaks to them of the old ways, of the wars against the Harkonnens, of the first Atreides here on Arrakis.\" \"On Dune!\" \"Dune, yes.\" \"It\u0027s because there\u0027s no more Dune that there are no more Fremen,\" Leto said. \"Have you conveyed my message to Nayla?\" \"Lord, why do you add to your peril?\" \"Did you convey my message?\" \"The messenger has been sent to Tuono, but I could still call her back.\" \"You will not call her back!\" \"But, Lord...\" \"What will she say to Nayla?\" \"That... that is your command for Nayla to continue in absolute and unquestioning obedience of my daughter except insofar... Lord! This is dangerous!\" \"Dangerous? Nayla is a Fish Speaker. She will obey me.\" \"But Siona... Lord, I fear that my daughter does not serve you with all of her heart. And Nayla is...\" \"Nayla must not deviate.\" \"Lord, let us hold your wedding in some other place.\" \"No!\" \"Lord, I know that your vision has revealed...\" \"The Golden Path endures, Moneo. You know that as well as L\" Moneo sighed. \"Infinity is yours, Lord. I do not question the...\" He broke off as a monstrous shuddering roar shook the tower, louder and louder. Both of them turned toward the sound- a descending plume of blue-orange light filled with swirling shockwaves came down to the desert less than a kilometer away to the south. \"Ahhh, my guest arrives,\" Leto said. \"I will send you down on my cart, Moneo. Bring only Malky back with you. Tell the Guildsmen this has earned my forgiveness, then send them away.\" \"Your for... yes, Lord. But if they have the secret of...\" \"They serve my purpose, Moneo. You must do the same. Bring Malky to me.\" Obediently, Moneo went to the cart which lay in shadows at the far side of the aerie chamber. He clambered on it, watched a mouth of night appear in the Wall. A landing-lip extruded into that night. The cart drifted outward, feather-light, and floated at an angle to the sand beside a Guild lighter which stood upright like a distorted miniature of the Little Citadel\u0027s tower. Leto watched from the balcony, his front segments lifted slightly to provide him a better viewing angle. His acute eyesight identified the white movement of Moneo standing on the cart in the moonlight. Long-legged Guild servitors came out with a litter which they slid onto the cart, standing there a moment in conversation with Moneo. When they left, Leto closed the cart\u0027s bubble cover and saw moonlight reflected from it. At his beckoning thought, the cart and its burden returned to the landing-lip. The Guild lighter lifted in its noisy rumbling while Leto was bringing the cart into the chamber\u0027s lights, closing the entrance behind it. Leto opened the bubble cover. Sand grated beneath him as he rolled to the litter and lifted his front segments to peer in at Malky who lay as though sleeping, lashed into the litter by broad gray elastic bindings. The man\u0027s face was ashen under dark gray hair. Haw he has aged, Leto thought. Moneo stepped down off the cart and looked back at the litter\u0027s occupant. \"He is injured, Lord. They want to send a medical...\" \"They wanted to send a spy.\" Leto studied Malky the dark wrinkled skin, the sunken cheeks, that sharp nose at such contrast with the rounded oval of his face. The heavy eyebrows had turned almost white. There but for a lifetime of testosterone... yes. Malky\u0027s eyes opened. Such a shock to find evil in those doe-like brown eyes! A smile twitched Malky\u0027s mouth. \"Lord Leto.\" Malky\u0027s voice was little more than a husky whisper. His eyes turned right, focusing on the majordomo. \"And Moneo. Forgive me for not rising to the occasion.\" \"Are you in pain?\" Leto asked. \"Sometimes.\" Malky\u0027s eyes moved to study his surroundings. \"Where are the houris?\" \"I\u0027m afraid I must deny you that pleasure, Malky.\" \"Just as well,\" Malky husked. \"I don\u0027t really feel up to their demands. Those were not houris you sent after me, Leto.\" \"They were professional in their obedience to me,\" Leto said. \"They were bloody hunters!\" \"Anteac was the hunter. My Fish Speakers were merely the clean-up crew.\" Moneo shifted his attention from one speaker to the other, back and forth. There were disturbing undertones in this conversation. Despite the huskiness, Malky sounded almost flippant... but then he had always been that way. A dangerous man! Leto said: \"Just before your arrival, Moneo and I were discussing Infinity.\" \"Poor Moneo,\" Malky said. Leto smiled. \"Do you remember, Malky? You once asked me to demonstrate Infinity.\" \"You said no Infinity exists to be demonstrated.\" Malky swept his gaze toward Moneo. \"Leto likes to play with paradox. He knows all the tricks of language that have ever been discovered.\" Moneo put down a surge of anger. He felt excluded from this conversation, an object of amusement by two superior beings. Malky and the God Emperor were almost like two old friends reliving the pleasures of a mutual past. \"Moneo accuses me of being the sole possessor of Infinity,\" Leto said. \"He refuses to believe that he has just as much of Infinity as I have.\" Malky stared up at Leto. \"You see, Moneo? You see how tricky he is with words?\" \"Tell me about your niece, Hwi Noree,\" Leto said. \"Is it true, Leto, what they say? That you are going to wed the gentle Hwi?\" \"It is true.\" Malky chuckled, then grimaced with pain. \"They did terrible damage to me, Leto,\" he whispered, then: \"Tell me, old worm...\" Moneo gasped. Malky took a moment to recover from pain, then: \"Tell me, old worm, is there a monster penis hidden in that monster body of yours? What a shock for the gentle Hwi!\" \"I told you the truth about that long ago,\" Leto said. \"Nobody tells the truth,\" Malky husked. \"You often told me the truth,\" Leto said. \"Even when you didn\u0027t know it.\" \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re cleverer than the rest of us.\" \"Will you tell me about Hwi?\" \"I think you already know it.\" \"I want to hear it from you,\" Leto said. \"Did you get help from the Tleilaxu?\" \"They gave us knowledge, nothing more. Everything else we did for ourselves.\" \"I thought it was not the Tleilaxus\u0027 doing.\" Moneo could no longer contain his curiosity. \"Lord, what is this of Hwi and Tleilaxu? Why do you...\" \"Here there, old friend Moneo,\" Malky said, rolling his gaze toward the majordomo. \"Don\u0027t you know what he...\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-30.html","bookId":2156,"book":{"id":2156,"title":"God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4) More than three thousand years have passed since the first events recorded in DUNE.
