{"id":97327,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\"I was never your friend!\" Moneo snapped.\\n\\n \"Companion among the houris then,\" Malky said.\\n\\n \"Lord,\" Moneo said, turning toward Leto, \"why do you speak of...\"\\n\\n \"Shhh, Moneo,\" Leto said. \"We are tiring your old companion and I have things to learn from him yet.\"\\n\\n \"Did you ever wonder, Leto,\" Malky asked, \"why Moneo never tried to take the whole shebang away from you?\"\\n\\n \"The what?\" Moneo demanded.\\n\\n \"Another of Leto\u0027s old words,\" Malky said. \"She and bang-shebang. It\u0027s perfect. Why don\u0027t you rename your Empire, Leto? The Grand Shebang!\"\\n\\n Leto raised a hand to silence Moneo. \"Will you tell me, Malky? About Hwi?\"\\n\\n \"Just a few tiny cells from my body,\" Malky said. \"Then the carefully nurtured growth and education-everything an exact opposite to your old friend, Malky. We did it all in the no-room where you cannot see!\"\\n\\n \"But I notice when something vanishes,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"No-room?\" Moneo asked, then as the import of Malky\u0027s words sank home. \"You? You and Hwi...\"\\n\\n \"That is the shape I saw in the shadows,\" Leto said.\\n\\n Moneo looked full at Leto\u0027s face. \"Lord, I will call off the wedding. I will say...\"\\n\\n \"You will do nothing of the kind!\"\\n\\n \"But Lord, if she and Malky are...\"\\n\\n \"Moneo,\" Malky husked. \"Your Lord commands and you must obey!\"\\n\\n That mocking tone! Moneo glared at Malky.\\n\\n \"The exact opposite of Malky,\" Leto said. \"Didn\u0027t you hear him?\"\\n\\n \"What could be better?\" Malky asked.\\n\\n \"But surely, Lord, if you now know...\"\\n\\n \"Moneo,\" Leto said, \"you are beginning to disturb me.\"\\n\\n Moneo fell into abashed silence.\\n\\n Leto said: \"That\u0027s better. You know, Moneo, once tens of thousands of years ago when I was another person, I made a mistake.\"\\n\\n \"You, a mistake?\" Malky mocked.\\n\\n Leto merely smiled. \"My mistake was compounded by the beautiful way in which I expressed it.\"\\n\\n \"Tricks with words,\" Malky taunted.\\n\\n \"Indeed! This is what I said: `The present is distraction; the future a dream; only memory can unlock the meaning of life.\u0027 Aren\u0027t those beautiful words, Malky?\"\\n\\n \"Exquisite, old worm.\"\\n\\n Moneo put a hand over his mouth.\\n\\n \"But my words were a foolish lie,\" Leto said. \"I knew it at the time, but I was infatuated with the beautiful words. No memory unlocks no meanings. Without anguish of the spirit, which is a wordless experience, there are no meanings anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"I fail to see the meaning of the anguish caused me by your bloody Fish Speakers,\" Malky said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re suffering no anguish,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"If you were in this body, you\u0027d...\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just physical pain,\" Leto said. \"It will end soon.\"\\n\\n \"Then when will I know the anguish?\" Malky asked.\\n\\n \"Perhaps later.\"\\n\\n Leto flexed his front segments away from Malky to face Moneo. \"Do you really serve the Golden Path, Moneo?\"\\n\\n \"Ahhh, the Golden Path,\" Malky taunted.\\n\\n \"You know I do, Lord,\" Moneo said.\\n\\n \"Then you must promise me,\" Leto said, \"that what you have learned here must never pass your lips. Not by word or sign can you reveal it.\"\\n\\n \"I promise, Lord.\"\\n\\n \"He promises, Lord,\" Malky sneered.\\n\\n One of Leto\u0027s tiny hands gestured at Malky, who lay staring up at the blunt profile of a face within its gray cowl. \"For reasons of old admiration and... many other reasons, I cannot kill Malky. I cannot even ask it of you... yet he must be eliminated.\"\\n\\n \"Ohhh, how clever you are!\" Malky said.\\n\\n \"Lord, if you will wait at the other end of the chamber,\" Moneo said. \"Perhaps when you return Malky no longer will be a problem.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s going to do it,\" Malky husked. \"Gods below! He\u0027s going to do it.\"\\n\\n Leto squirmed away and went to the shadowed limit of the chamber, keeping his attention on the faint arc of a line which would become an opening into the night if he merely converted the wish into a thought-of-command. What a long drop that would be out there-just roll off the landing-lip. He doubted that even his body would survive it. But there was no water in the sand beneath his tower and he could feel the Golden Path winking in and out of existence merely because he allowed himself to think of such an end.\\n\\n \"Leto!\" Malky called from behind him.\\n\\n Leto heard the litter grating on the wind-scattered sand which peppered the floor of his aerie.\\n\\n Once more, Malky called: \"Leto, you are the best! There\u0027s no evil in this universe which can surpass...\"\\n\\n A sodden thump shut off Malky\u0027s voice. A blow to the throat, Leto thought. Yes, Moneo knows that one. There came the sound of the balcony\u0027s transparent shield sliding open, the rasping of the litter on the rail, then silence.\\n\\n Moneo will have to bury the body in the sand, Leto thought. There is as yet no worm to come and devour the evidence. Leto turned then and looked across the chamber. Moneo stood leaning over the railing, peering down... down... down...\\n\\n I cannot pray for you, Malky, nor for you, Moneo, Leto thought. l may be the only religious consciousness in the Empire because I am truly alone... so I cannot pray.\\n\\n - \u003d You cannot understand history unless you understand its flowings, its currents and the ways leaders move within such forces. A leader tries to perpetuate the conditions which demand his leadership. Thus, the leader requires the outsider. I caution you to examine my career with care. I am both leader and outsider. Do not make the mistake of assuming that I only created the Church which was the State. That was my function as leader and I had many historical models to use as pattern. For a clue to my role as outsider, look at the arts of my time. The arts are barbaric. The favorite poetry? The Epic. The popular dramatic ideal? Heroism. Dances? Wildly abandoned. From Moneo\u0027s viewpoint, he is correct in describing this as dangerous. It stimulates the imagination. It makes people feel the lack of that which I have taken from them. What did I take from them? The right to participate in history.\\n\\n - The Stolen Journals IDAHO, STRETCHED out on his cot with his eyes closed, heard a weight drop onto the other cot. He sat up into the midafternoon light which slanted through the room\u0027s single window at a sharp angle, reflecting off the white-tiled floor onto the light yellow walls. Siona, he saw, had come in and stretched herself on her cot. She already was reading one of the books she carried around with her in a green fabric pack.\\n\\n Why books? he wondered.\\n\\n He swung his feet to the floor and glanced around the room. How could this high-ceilinged, spacious box be considered even remotely Fremen? A wide table/desk of some dark brown local plastic separated the two cots. There were two doors. One led directly outside across a garden. The other admitted them to a luxurious bath whose pale blue tiles glistened under a broad skylight. The bath contained, among its many functional services, a sunken tub and a shower, each at least two meters square. The door to this sybaritic space remained open and Idaho could hear water running out of the tub. Siona appeared oddly fond of bathing in an excess of water.\\n\\n Stilgar, Idaho\u0027s Naib of the ancient days on Dune, would have looked on that room with scorn. \"Shameful!\" he would have said. \"Decadent! Weak!\" Stilgar would have used many scornful words about this entire village which dared to compare itself with a true Fremen sietch.\\n\\n Paper rustled as Siona turned a page. She lay with her head propped on two pillows, a thin white robe covering her body. The robe still revealed clinging wetness from her bath.\\n\\n Idaho shook his head. What was it on those pages which held her interest this way? She had been reading and re-reading since their arrival at Tuono. The volumes were thin but numerous, bearing only numbers on their black bindings. Idaho had seen a number nine.\\n\\n Swinging his feet to the floor, he stood and went to the window. There was an old man out there at a distance, digging in flowers. The garden was protected by buildings on three sides. The flowers bore large blossoms-red on the outside but, when they unfolded, white in the center. The old Man\u0027s uncovered gray hair was a kind of blossom waving among the floral white and jeweled buds. Idaho smelled moldering leaves and freshly turned dirt against a background of pungent floral perfume.\\n\\n A Fremen tending flowers in the open!\\n\\n Siona volunteered nothing about her strange reading matter. She\u0027s taunting me, Idaho thought. She wants me to ask.\\n\\n He tried not to think about Hwi. Rage threatened to engulf him when he did. He remembered the Fremen word for that intense emotion: kanawa, the iron ring of jealousy. Where is Hwi? What is she doing at this moment?\\n\\n The door from the garden opened without a knock and Teishar, an aide to Garun, entered. Teishar had a dead colored\\n\\n face full of dark wrinkles. His eyes were sunken with pale yellow around the pupils. Teishar wore a brown robe. He had hair like old grass that had been left out to rot. He seemed unnecessarily ugly, like a dark and elemental spirit. Teishar closed the door and stood there looking at them.\\n\\n Siona\u0027s voice came from behind Idaho. \"Well, what is it?\"\\n\\n Idaho noticed then that Teishar seemed strangely excited, vibrating with it.\\n\\n \"The God Emperor...\" Teishar cleared his throat and began again. \"The God Emperor will come to Tuono!\"\\n\\n Siona sat upright on the bed, folding her white robe over her knees. Idaho glanced back at her, then once more to Teishar.\\n\\n \"He will be wed here, here in Tuono!\" Teishar said. \"It will be done in the ancient Fremen way! The God Emperor and his bride will be guests of Tuono!\"\\n\\n Full in the grip of kanawa, Idaho glared at him, fists clenched. Teishar bobbed his head briefly, turned and let himself out, shutting the door hard.\\n\\n \"Let me read you something, Duncan,\" Siona said.\\n\\n Idaho was a moment understanding her words. Fists still clenched at his sides, he turned and looked at her. Siona sat on the edge of her cot, a book in her lap. She took his attention as agreement.\\n\\n \"Some believe,\" she read, \"that you must compromise integrity with a certain amount of dirty work before you can put genius to work. They say the compromise begins when you come out of the sanctus intending to realize your ideals. Moneo says my solution is to stay within the sanctus, sending others to do my dirty work.\"\\n\\n She looked up at Idaho. \"The God Emperor-his own words.\"\\n\\n Slowly, Idaho relaxed his fists. He knew he needed this distraction. And it interested him that Siona had emerged from her silence.\\n\\n \"What is that book?\" he asked.\\n\\n Briefly, she told him how she and her companions had stolen the Citadel charts and the copies of Leto\u0027s journals.\\n\\n \"Of course you knew about that,\" she said. \"My father has made it plain that spies betrayed our raid.\"\\n\\n He saw the tears latent in her eyes. \"Nine of you killed by the wolves?\"\\n\\n She nodded.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a lousy Commander!\" he said.\\n\\n She bristled but before she could speak, he asked: \"Who translated them for you?\"\\n\\n \"This is from Ix. They say the Guild found the Key.\"\\n\\n \"We already knew our God Emperor indulged in expedience,\" Idaho said. \"Is that all he has to say?\"\\n\\n \"Read it for yourself.\" She rummaged in her pack beside the cot and came up with the first volume of the translation, which she tossed across to his cot. As Idaho returned to the cot, she demanded: \"What do you mean I\u0027m a lousy Commander\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Wasting nine of your friends that way.\"\\n\\n \"You fool!\" She shook her head. \"You obviously never saw those wolves!\"\\n\\n He picked up the book and found it heavy, realizing then that it had been printed on crystal paper. \"You should have armed yourselves against the wolves,\" he said, opening the volume.\\n\\n \"What arms?\" Any arms we could get would\u0027ve been useless!\"\\n\\n \"Lasguns?\" he asked, turning a page.\\n\\n \"Touch a lasgun on Arrakis and the Worm knows it!\"\\n\\n He turned another page. \"Your friends got lasguns eventually.\"\\n\\n \"And look what it got them!\"\\n\\n Idaho read a line, then: \"Poisons were available.\"\\n\\n She swallowed convulsively.\\n\\n Idaho looked at her. \"You did poison the wolves after all, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Her voice was almost a whisper: \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Then why didn\u0027t you do that in advance?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"We... didn\u0027t... know... we... could.\"\\n\\n \"But you didn\u0027t test it,\" Idaho said. He turned back to the open volume. \"A lousy Commander.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s so devious!\" Siona said.\\n\\n Idaho read a passage in the volume before returning his attention to Siona. \"That hardly describes him. Have you read all of this?\"\\n\\n \"Every word! Some of them several times.\"\\n\\n Idaho looked at the open page and read aloud: \"I have created what I intended-a powerful spiritual tension throughout my Empire. Few sense the strength of it. With what energies did I create this condition? I am not that strong. The only power\\n\\n I possess is the control of individual prosperity. That is the sum of all the things I do. Then why do people seek my presence for other reasons? What could lead them to certain death in the futile attempt to reach my presence? Do they want to be saints? Do they think that thus they gain the vision of God?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s the ultimate cynic,\" Siona said, tears apparent in her voice.\\n\\n \"How did he test you?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n \"He showed me a... he showed me his Golden Path.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s convenient...\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s real enough, Duncan.\" She looked up at him, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. \"But if it was ever a reason for our God Emperor, it is not reason for what he has become!\"\\n\\n Idaho inhaled deeply, then: \"The Atreides come to this!\"\\n\\n \"The Worm must go!\" Siona said.\\n\\n \"I wonder when he\u0027s arriving?\" Idaho said.\\n\\n \"Garun\u0027s little rat friend didn\u0027t say.\"\\n\\n \"We must ask,\" Idaho said.\\n\\n \"We have no weapons,\" Siona said.\\n\\n \"Nayla has a lasgun,\" he said. \"We have knives... rope. I saw rope in one of Garun\u0027s storage rooms.\"\\n\\n \"Against the Worm?\" she asked. \"Even if we could get Nyala\u0027s lasgun, you know it won\u0027t touch him.\"\\n\\n \"But is his cart proof against it?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t trust Nayla,\" Siona said.\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t she obey you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but...\\n\\n \"We will proceed one step at a time,\" Idaho said. \"Ask Nayla if she would use her lasgun against the Worm\u0027s cart.\"\\n\\n \"And if she refuses?\"\\n\\n \"Kill her.\"\\n\\n Siona stood, tossing her book aside.\\n\\n \"How will the Worm come to Tuono?\" Idaho asked. \"He\u0027s too big and heavy for an ordinary \u0027thopter.\"\\n\\n \"Garun will tell us,\" she said. \"But I think he will come as he usually travels.\" She looked up at the ceiling which concealed the Sareer\u0027s perimeter Wall. \"I think he will come on peregrination with his entire crew. He will come along the Royal Road and drop down to here on suspensors.\" She looked at Idaho. \"What of Garun?\"\\n\\n \"A strange man,\" Idaho said. \"He wants most desperately to be a real Fremen. He knows he is not anything like what they were in my day.\"\\n\\n \"What were they like in your day, Duncan?\" \"They had a saying which describes it,\" Idaho said. \"You should never be in the company of anyone with whom you would not want to die.\" \"Did you say this to Garun?\" she asked. \"Yes.\" \"And his response?\" \"He said I was the only such person he had ever met.\" \"Garun may be wiser than any of us,\" she said. -\u003d You think power may be the most unstable of all human achievements? Then what of the apparent exceptions to this inherent instability? Some families endure. Very powerful religious bureaucracies have been known to endure. Consider the relationship between faith and power. Are they mutually exclusive when each depends upon the other? The Bene Gesserit have been reasonably secure within the loyal walls of faith for thousands of years. But where has their power gone?\\n\\n - The Stolen Journals MONEO SPOKE in a petulant tone: \"Lord, I wish you had given me more time.\"\\n\\n He stood outside the Citadel in the short shadows of noon. Leto lay directly in front of him on the Imperial Cart, its bubble hood retracted. He had been touring the environs with Hwi Noree, who occupied a newly installed seat within the bubble cover\u0027s perimeter and just beside Leto\u0027s face. Hwi appeared merely curious about all the bustle which was beginning to increase around them.\\n\\n How calm she is, Moneo thought. He repressed an involuntary shudder at what he had learned of her from Malky. The God Emperor was right. Hwi was exactly what she appeared to be-an ultimately sweet and sensible human being. Would she really have mated with me? Moneo wondered.\\n\\n Distractions drew his attention away from her. While Leto had toured Hwi around the Citadel on the suspensor-borne cart, a great troop of courtiers and Fish Speakers had been assembled here, all the courtiers in celebration finery, brilliant reds and golds dominant. The Fish Speakers wore their best dark blues, distinguished only by the different colors in the piping and hawks. A baggage caravan on suspensor sleds had been drawn up at the rear with Fish Speakers to pull it. The air was full of dust and the sounds and smells of excitement. Most of the courtiers had reacted with dismay when told their destination. Some had immediately purchased their own tents and pavilions. These had been sent on ahead with the other impediments piled now on the sand just outside Tuono\u0027s view. The Fish Speakers in the entourage were not taking this in a festive mood. They had complained loudly when told they could not carry lasguns.\\n\\n \"Just a little more time, Lord,\" Moneo was saying. \"I still don\u0027t know how we will...\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no substitute for time in solving many problems,\" Leto said. \"However, you can place too much reliance on it. I can accept no more delays.\"\\n\\n \"We will be three days just getting there,\" Moneo complained.\\n\\n Leto thought about that time-the swift walk-trot-walk of a peregrination... one hundred and eighty kilometers. Yes, three days.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve made good arrangements for the waystops,\" Leto said. \"Plenty of hot water for the muscle cramps?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be comfortable enough,\" Moneo said, \"but I don\u0027t like leaving the Citadel in these times! And you know why!\"\\n\\n \"We have communications devices, loyal assistants. The Guild is suitably chastened. Calm yourself, Moneo.\"\\n\\n \"We could hold the ceremony in the Citadel!\"\\n\\n For answer, Leto closed the bubble cover around him, isolating Hwi with him.\\n\\n \"Is there danger, Leto?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s always danger.\"\\n\\n Moneo sighed, turned and trotted toward where the Royal Road began its long climb eastward before turning south around the Sareer. Leto set his cart in motion behind the majordomo, heard his motley troop fall into step behind them.\\n\\n \"Are we all moving?\" Leto asked.\\n\\n Hwi glanced backward around him. \"Yes.\" She turned toward his face. \"Why was Moneo being so difficult?\"\\n\\n \"Moneo has discovered that the instant which has just left him is forever beyond his reach.\"\\n\\n \"He has been very moody and distracted since you returned from the Little Citadel. He\u0027s not the same at all.\"\\n\\n \"He is an Atreides, my love, and you were designed to please an Atreides.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that. I would know if it were that.\"\\n\\n \"Yes... well, I think Moneo has also discovered the reality of death.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s it like at the Little Citadel when you\u0027re there with Moneo?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the loneliest place in my Empire.\"\\n\\n \"I think you avoid my questions,\" she said.\\n\\n \"No, love. I share your concern for Moneo, but no explanation of mine will help him now. Moneo is trapped. He has learned that it is difficult to live in the present, pointless to live in the future and impossible to live in the past.\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s you who have trapped him, Leto.\"\\n\\n \"But he must free himself.\"\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t you free him?\"\\n\\n \"Because he thinks my memories are his key to freedom. He thinks I am building our future out of our past.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that always the way of it, Leto?\"\\n\\n \"No, dear Hwi.\"\\n\\n \"Then how is it?\"\\n\\n \"Most believe that a satisfactory future requires a return to an idealized past, a past which never in fact existed.\"\\n\\n \"And you with all of your memories know otherwise.\"\\n\\n Leto turned his face within its cowl to stare at her, probing... remembering. Out of the multitudes within him, he could form a composite, a genetic suggestion of Hwi, but the suggestion fell far short of the living flesh. That was it, of course. The past became row-on-row of eyes staring outward like the eyes of gasping fish, but Hwi was vibrant life. Her mouth was set in Grecian curves designed for a Delphic chant, but she hummed no prophetic syllables. She was content to live, an opening person like a flower perpetually unfolding into fragrant blossom.\\n\\n \"Why are you looking at me like that?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"I was basking in the love of you.\"\\n\\n \"Love, yes.\" She smiled. \"I think that since we cannot share the love of the flesh, we must share the love of the soul. Would you share that with me, Leto?\"\\n\\n He was taken aback. \"You ask about my soul?\"\\n\\n \"Surely others have asked.\"\\n\\n He spoke shortly: \"My soul digests its experiences, nothing more.\"\\n\\n \"Have I asked too much of you?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"I think that you cannot ask too much of me.\"\\n\\n \"Then I presume upon our love to disagree with you. My Uncle Malky talked about your soul.\"\\n\\n He found that he could not respond. She took his silence as an invitation to continue. \"He said that you were the ultimate artist at probing the soul, your own soul first.\"\\n\\n \"But your Uncle Malky denied that he had a soul of his own!\"\\n\\n She heard the harshness in his voice, but was not deterred. \"Still, I think he was right. You are the genius of the soul, the brilliant one.\"\\n\\n \"You need only the plodding perseverance of duration,\" he said. \"No brilliance.\"\\n\\n They were well onto the long climb to the top of the Sareer\u0027s perimeter Wall now. He lowered his cart\u0027s wheels and deactivated the suspensors.\\n\\n Hwi spoke softly, her voice barely audible above the grating sound of the cart\u0027s wheels and the running feet all around them. \"May I call you Love, anyway?\"\\n\\n He spoke around a remembered tightness in a throat which was no longer completely human. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I was born an Ixian, Love,\" she said. \"Why don\u0027t I share their mechanical view of our universe? Do you know my view, Leto my love?\"\\n\\n He could only stare at her.\\n\\n \"I sense the supernatural at every turning,\" she said.\\n\\n Leto\u0027s voice rasped, sounding angry even to him: \"Each person creates his own supernatural.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be angry with me, Love.\"\\n\\n Again, that awful rasping: \"It is impossible for me to be angry with you.\"\\n\\n \"But something happened between you and Malky once,\" she said. \"He would never tell me what it was, but he said he often wondered why you spared him.\"\\n\\n \"Because of what he taught me.\"\\n\\n \"What happened between you two, Love?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-31.html","bookId":2156,"book":{"id":2156,"title":"God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4) \\n More than three thousand years have passed since the first events recorded in DUNE.
