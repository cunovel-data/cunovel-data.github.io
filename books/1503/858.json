They gradually happened from the inside out, and from a close distance to a farther distance. The terrifying explosions caused the sky to become the shrine of light and darkness in an instant. At this moment, the entire sky looked as though it was being lit with splendid fireworks; a massive amount of Destruction Attribute energy were dispersed in all directions. Be it Long Shiya’s enormous phantom figure or Shen Mo’s huge mouth, they had both completely vanished at this moment - none of them could be seen. The Heavenly Snow Mountain shook vigorously – not just it, even the entire Ten Thousand Beast Heavens swayed violently, as though the end of the world was coming. Everything was about to be destroyed in a frenzy. Terrifying energy erupted in the air. As for Zhou Weiqing, he felt extremely anxious at this moment. Although he was very clear with regards to Long Shiya’s power, it was his master’s first battle after making a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage. Moreover, they were unaware of how long his opponent had been a Heavenly God for. Zhou Weiqing would rather lose this fight and even the entire Grand Tournament than to see Long Shiya get injured. Earlier, when Long Shiya’s Six Ultimate Celestial Territory was being enveloped by the opponent’s Destruction Celestial Territory, he had already thought of giving up the fight. However, Long Shiya’s series of attacks after had caused Zhou Weiqing to be completely shocked, exclaiming in admiration to himself. This was the actual power of control. Even though Zhou Weiqing possessed the Saint Energy, together with the six attributes, Long Shiya was way ahead of him in terms of controlling the attributes. One would say that Long Shiya was extremely skillful when it came to controlling the six attributes. The sequence of the attributes, as well as the pairings and control were all perfect and cleverly executed. From the looks of it, it was not a joint attack of all six attributes. But in reality, the planned attacks in such a sequence were a lot more impactful and powerful than a combined attack. It was much more terrifying on the whole. This was power! However, his opponent was a Heavenly God after all. Upon executing such a precise control, it was a huge burden on Long Shiya’s will. If he could not defeat his opponent after these attacks, Long Shiya would be in grave danger. The Peerless Sect had already killed off two Heavenly Emperors of the Blood Red Hell. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing knew that if they had given Shen Mo an opportunity, he definitely would not let Long Shiya off. Be it for the Peerless Sect or Zhou Weiqing, losing a Heavenly God would be devastating. Zhou Weiqing had already done all the preparations needed, in the event he had to step in. Even if it meant going against the regulations, he would not let his master die on the Heavenly Snow Mountain. On the other hand, Fen Tian was similarly anxious. He never expected Long Shiya to become a Heavenly God. If Shen Mo were to win this fight, it would bring about a lot of opportunities for the Blood Red Hell in this Grand Tournament, and thus allowing him to continue his plans within the Grand Tournament. The result of this fight was of great importance. Furthermore, similarly, in the eyes of the Blood Red Hell, having a Heavenly God powerhouse who possessed the Destruction Celestial Territory was extremely important. Perhaps, losing ten Heavenly Emperors would not cause much grief to Fen Tian. However, if Shen Mo were to die in the fight, then he might truly go berserk. Instinctively, Fen Tian lifted his head and looked towards Zhou Weiqing. Both of them exchanged glances, seemingly noticing the strong killing intent in each other’s eyes. Not only did they have the intention to save their own member, they also had to deal with each other. The atmosphere became intensified as they were on the verge of drawing their swords to fight. A layer of golden light appeared at this moment. A dense golden light that was filled with Divine Heavenly aura enveloped the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. It came from the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian. He swept his gaze across from Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian. Nobody knew what he was thinking. However, at the same time, an intense vibrating energy descended from the sky and a layer of light fog pounded against the golden light curtain. This was Xue AoTian’s territory. He did not want the Heavenly Snow Mountain to be destroyed by the fight between Long Shiya and Shen Mo. Hence, he was the first to take action. In the event that Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian were to fight each other, they had to break through the layer of obstruction first, on top of dealing with each other. Terrifying energy ripples erupted in the air instantly. Shock appeared on Zhou Weiqing’s face, as a result of what was happening in the sky. Similarly, Fen Tian was stunned as well. This was because the both of them had clearly seen the change that occured within the sky. The darkness that originally filled the sky had been completely obliterated. The Destruction Celestial Territory had vanished. Ultimately, as a result of Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya’s full-force attack, it had exploded. However, in the sky, Long Shiya’s enormous figure had also disappeared. While the explosion of the Destruction Celestial Territory had a detrimental effect on Shen Mo, it was also detrimental to Long Shiya. His will had been drained too much, to the point that it could not longer support his own Six Ultimate Celestial Territory. Moreover, it had suffered a huge impact from the final attack from the Destruction Celestial Territory in its final moments. At this moment, Shen Mo and Long Shiya continued to linger in mid-air, except for the fact that the distance between both parties had been widened to a thousand meters. They exchanged glances; both their faces had clearly become paler, particularly Shen Mo. His body was trembling slightly. Long Shiya had shut both his eyes, and his body swayed lightly for a moment. It was extremely quiet at the bottom. The collision between both Heavenly Gods had caused all the powerhouses to be stunned. Long Shiya, who paled in comparison in terms of cultivation base and celestial territory, had forcefully overcome his disadvantage solely based on his full understanding of the six attributes as well as his immaculate control over them. At this moment, it was still hard to tell who had emerged victorious, but at the very least, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God was no longer on the losing end. It was safe to say that this was the most spectacular fight in the history of the Grand Tournament. The fight between both Heavenly Gods had purged almost all the attribute energy elements within the radius of several hundred miles. Shen Mo glared at Long Shiya. Mixed feelings could be seen in his eyes. He had never expected that his Destruction Celestial Territory that he achieved after breaking through to the Heavenly God Stage still was unable to defeat Long Shiya. He was very clear with regards to his current physical condition - he was injured. As a Heavenly God, his body was terrifyingly strong - it was exceedingly difficult to injure his body. However, once he got injured, it would be hard for him to treat his injuries. The current situation of the two parties was simple - Shen Mo was injured and had even hurt his vitality, while Long Shiya’s will had been overly drained. On the whole, Shen Mo was at a slight disadvantage. However, if they were to fight to the death, they would have to risk perishing together. “I never expected that you could destroy my Destruction Celestial Territory, Brother Long. In that case, let’s make it a tie and both be disqualified, giving other people a chance, shall we? The sequence of the first round will not be changed,” said Shen Mo in a deep voice. Long Shiya did not open his eyes. Neither did he argue with him. “Alright.” Both of them descended at the same time and returned to their respective Saint Lands. They did the same action at almost the same time, sitting cross-legged in their respective areas, trying their best to recover their bodies. Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian each went behind their backs, assisting in their treatment. Xue AoTian and Shangguan Tianyang exchanged glances; they both had a strange look in their eyes. Once again, they had benefited from the outcome. They were very clear that as long as they did not step into the arena, both Long Shiya and Shen Mo were able to defeat any one of their representatives. Furthermore, their tie prevented the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace from being directly disqualified from this cycle. The next participant from the Peerless Sect was a woman. Upon seeing her, the two brothers, Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue, clearly looked worried. That was because the next participant from the Peerless Sect was none other than Shangguan Xue’er. The situation was no different from the previous cycle. As the tournament continued, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had each sent out a Heavenly King. This time, the Heavenly Snow Mountain had the upper hand. Upon their victory, they had similarly forfeited, causing the Passion Valley to go against the Blood Red Hell next. This time, Huang Xingyun had seemed to learn his lesson - he had immediately sent out a Heavenly King powerhouse. After a brief consideration, Fen Tian had sent out a Heavenly Emperor once again. As expected, the Blood Red Hell emerged victorious. The two brothers, Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue, had become anxious almost immediately. Even though they knew that Shangguan Xue’er had become a Heavenly King, and had also consolidated a few more pieces of the Boundless Infinitum Set, the person she had to go against was the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor! How would a Heavenly Emperor that possessed the Destruction Attribute be easy to deal with? If she were to slip up, she could very well end up dead. Previously, the Peerless Sect had already killed off two members of the Blood Red Hell. They would definitely not show mercy towards Shangguan Xue’er. The two brothers’ gazes quickly fell upon Zhou Weiqing, who was done attending to Long Shiya’s injuries. Their gazes were filled with intense resentment and puzzlement. The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor was called Tian Yu. Within the Blood Red Hell, the two biggest family names were ‘Tian’ and ‘Shen’. They were the two families that controlled the Blood Red Hell. Fen Tian’s last name was also ‘Tian’ - the two characters of his name were switched around. Tian Yu was Fen Tian’s cousin. Looking at the young Shangguan Xue’er, Tian yu could not help but furrow his brows slightly. He was somewhat disdainful and said, “From the looks of it, the Peerless Sect only has those two old fellows, Wu Yunyue and Long Shiya. Now that they are gone, they have no choice but to sent out a little girl like you to die.” A cold look flashed across Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes. Just as she was about to retort, Zhou Weiqing’s voice was heard, “Wait a moment.” As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing took a huge step forward and slowly stood next to Shangguan Xue’er. He looked over at Fen Tian and said, “If I remembered correctly, based on the rules of the Grand Tournament, the leader of any of the five Great Saint Lands can substitute their own members at any given time, right?” Upon hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, everyone present was startled. The Peerless Sect’s power had already been proven by Wu Yunyue and Long Shiya. Nobody dared to look down on them. However, nobody could comprehend Zhou Weiqing’s current course of action.
