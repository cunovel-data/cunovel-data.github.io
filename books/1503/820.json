{"id":51994,"no":820,"title":"Chapter 279 - Whitish Golden Nebula Saint Energy? (1)","content":"As a Heavenly Emperor, naturally, the man in black did not possess his own Celestial Territory. As he was within the Sidhe Queen’s Nature Celestial Territory, it was impossible for him to perform Time Reversal. \n “The Sidhe Queen?” the man in black exclaimed. His voice was somewhat hoarse and it was apparent that he was trying to lower his voice. He seemed to be hiding his true identity - his entire body was wrapped in black clothes. It was impossible to see what he looked like. \n A series of dark golden light rays started appearing and he was equipped with a nine-piece Legendary Set that covered his entire body. His helmet was an enclosed one, making it harder to see his face.\n The Sidhe Queen and Zhou Weiqing were standing on each side, glaring coldly at the man in black. She said in a low voice, “Hand over my daughter or you will die.”\n The man in black was not anxious at all, but he did not dare to act blindly without careful deliberation - if he were to make any sudden movements, Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen would definitely launch a combined attack on him. The man in black was not going to forcefully fight against a powerful and intimidating Heavenly Emperor that he had no information about, as well as the Sidhe Queen, who was a Heavenly God, unless he was a moron.\n “I don’t know what Your Majesty is talking about, I am merely carrying out my daily activities, and I’m in a rush. Doesn’t the Sidhe Tribe stay out of human affairs? By doing this, you are instigating a war between humans and the sidhe race,” said the man in black craftily.\n Even though the Sidhe Queen had a high cultivation base, she was not good with words. She immediately became more furious, “You……” The energy within the Nature Celestial Territory violently surged. Overwhelming energy ripples continuously erupted from her body. She was ready to attack.\n As the man in black was hidden behind his Consolidating Set, his facial expression could not be seen. However, a layer of strange distorted light emitted from his body. It continued flickering, seemingly rejecting the surrounding Nature Celestial Territory.\n Zhou Weiqing gave an indifferent smile, “Who said that Her Majesty is stopping you? This has nothing to do with the sidhe race challenging the human beings - I am the one who’s stopping you.”\n “You? Why would you stop me?” The man in black did not turn around to look at Zhou Weiqing. Even though Zhou Weiqing managed to inflict some damage on him earlier, the Heavenly God Stage Sidhe Queen was more of a threat to the man in black.\n At this moment, he was secretly astonished. He had never expected Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen to use Spatial Shuttle to chase and stop him in his tracks.\n In order to capture the Sidhe Princess, he had been pacing back and forth outside the sealed grounds for a long time. He had even used up a couple of his perishable valuable treasures in order to increase his rate of success. After he had succeeded, he immediately fled far away, assuming that it was impossible for them to catch him. Who knew that within such a short period of time, the Sidhe Queen would actually appear right before him? At this moment, he was well aware that it would be very difficult for him to escape. All he could do was look for an opportunity. After all, to escape the clutches of a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse was a difficult feat! Needless to say, he had a hidden trump card too. \n Zhou Weiqing smiled, “The reason why I’m not letting you go is because you have kidnapped my daughter-in-law. I left a trace of my will on her, allowing me to find you. Your Majesty, please deactivate your Celestial Territory. This matter is between me and this brother over here, it has nothing to do with you or the sidhe.”\n The reason why the Sidhe Queen held back her punches was because she was slightly apprehensive. Even if Zhou Weiqing and her were to be able to stop that Heavenly Emperor from leaving, if anything went wrong, news of the sidhe would spread - particularly about the Sidhe Queen attacking a human. It could potentially cause the sidhe a lot of problems. Moreover, she truly did not have any cold hard evidence against him.\n Most importantly, they were up against a Heavenly Emperor with the Time Attribute - at this cultivation base, anyone who specialized in Time Attribute would be able to use it to transmit news and information via a skill called the Time Image. Before his impending death, that Heavenly Emperor was able to leave an image in the sky and it was impossible to remove it. It would remain there for a long time. It could even retain everything that happened before his eyes. People with ulterior motives would be able to use it against the sidhe. \n Undoubtedly, Zhou Weiqing said those words to resolve her dilemma. As for Zhou Weiqing referring to her daughter as his daughter-in-law, the Sidhe Queen did not take what he said seriously. She couldn’t possibly be aware of the vile thoughts of a certain somebody! \n The Sidhe Queen looked gratefully at Zhou Weiqing. Without any hesitation, she deactivated her Nature Celestial Territory, and even retreated a few steps back.\n She had some sort of blind faith in Zhou Weiqing due to the fact that he possessed Saint Energy. Additionally, since both parties were Heavenly Emperors, the man in black should have zero chance of winning against him. Not to forget, in her earlier fight against Zhou Weiqing, she ultimately had to rely on the elders’ strength to block the Sword of the Demon God’s terrifying attack.\n The man in black stared blankly. Even though Zhou Weiqing’s words took complete charge, ruining his schemes, he had nothing to fear as he was only going up against one Heavenly Emperor. Besides, he was a High Level Heavenly Emperor himself. He was also not too concerned about Zhou Weiqing’s strength, as he knew that he was careless in their earlier exchange.\n “I don’t know what you are talking about, or who your daughter-in-law is. I did not kidnap anyone. Just because you claim that you had left a trace of your will behind, it doesn’t mean it’s true.” In his opinion, even if it was true, the will was probably left behind by the Sidhe Queen and not Zhou Weiqing. He had no idea why he was with the Sidhe Queen, but it was clear to him that Zhou Weiqing went to the sealed grounds to take advantage of them, except that he ended up being made a scapegoat by him. He had never expected Zhou Weiqing to get away, let alone appearing before him with the Sidhe Queen herself. \n He did manage to get what he wanted and had also successfully instigated a fight between Zhou Weiqing and the sidhe. However, he did not expect the fight to resolve that quickly, allowing Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen to catch up with him that fast. \n Zhou Weiqing was still full of smiles - he always had that facial expression whenever he was plotting against someone. “How about this, if you allow me to conduct a search with my will, and if I can’t find my daughter-in-law, I will let you go.” \n “You must be daydreaming. I am an esteemed Heavenly Emperor, do you think that I will let you conduct a search just because you want to?”\n Zhou Weiqing burst out laughing, “An esteemed Heavenly Emperor? Being that evasive and afraid to reveal your identity - you are not fit to be called a Heavenly Emperor.”\n “How dare you insult me?” The man in black was clearly furious, the time distortion around him intensified. If not for the Sidhe Queen’s intimidating presence, he would have already attacked Zhou Weiqing. However, all he could think of right now was how to escape. \n Zhou Weiqing looked rather tough - his whole body was covered in a bright golden ten-piece armor. He had a pair of enormous hammers in his hands and a pair of purple wings with golden light on their edges. Coupled with the formidable power he displayed earlier, he was clearly not an easy opponent. However, he felt that his threat was effective. Without the limitation put in place by the Sidhe Queen’s Celestial Territory, escaping was not a big issue. At this moment, he was calculating the best way possible to escape, at the lowest cost. As long as he could successfully escape, his mission would be completed. \n “Insult you? You call that insulting? Do you know what insulting is? Let me teach you.” Zhou Weiqing’s mouth twitched in disdain, “Looking at your evasive revolting behavior, you must be the scum of all scums, the beast of all beasts. And based on my observation, you were probably ill-bred as a child, lacking love as you grew up - nobody in your family loved you. Your left cheek deserves to be slapped and your right cheek deserves to be kicked. Donkeys would kick you and pigs would trample on you. You were born a walnut tree, the more you get beaten, the better. If I throw you into the latrine, the latrine would throw up and toss you into a spatial rift, which will self-explode because of you! Look, I am trying to talk to you but why do you have your face up your butt? Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize that was your face. Where did your butt go? There isn’t a cure for being cheap and despicable. Let me do a good deed and get rid of you on behalf of the heavens.”\n Zhou Weiqing was solemn from the start to the end, as though he was recounting a serious incident. Furthermore, he spoke very fast, akin to firecrackers exploding in succession. He had humiliated him in a single breath. By the time the man in black had fully comprehended what he said, Zhou Weiqing was already done. He even wore a disdainful look on his face.\n Not only did the man in black become hopping mad, the Sidhe Queen’s mouth also twitched - Zhou Weiqing truly went all out to reproach him, without using a single swear word. Looking at possibly the youngest Heavenly Emperor in the human world run his mouth like that, it was no wonder the Sidhe Queen was shocked. If she were in the man in black’s position, it was hard for her to imagine how angry she would have been.\n The man in black’s body started trembling uncontrollably. He pointed at Zhou Weiqing, “You, you, you……” \n Zhou Weiqing scoffed, “What are you trying to say? Your sister! Even if you have a sister, I wouldn’t be interested.”\n “Bastard. Go to hell.” The man in black finally lost all self-control. As a Heavenly Emperor, he had quite an honorable status. He had never been humiliated by anyone to such an extent. Triggered by Zhou Weiqing’s smug facial expression, he could no longer maintain his composure, even though he knew that he should. \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-279-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
