(3)\n Knowing that they were about to reach their target, all of them carefully released their Consolidated Equipment. At this point, none of them had any mood to play around any longer, their faces bleak and serious. Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense the heart of the flames was extremely close, the sheer amount of energy bursting forth was just so terrifying.\n The four girls did not hesitate to follow Zhou Weiqing, each of them releasing their respective Legendary Sets. As for the other three girls, Zhou Weiqing had actually seen their Consolidated Equipment previously, but this was the first time he saw Shangguan Bing’er’s new Legendary Set Consolidated Equipment.\n The familiar dark gold light sprang forth, and behind Shangguan Bing’er’s back, a pair of dark gold wings appeared. However, in contrast to Shangguan Fei’er, her wings seemed much larger, even folded in behind her back, it could actually still cover her entire body from the back. Besides that, Shangguan Bing’er also had a beautiful looking breastplate covering her front, and though it was also dark gold in colour, the center of it had a faint green gemstone that was filled with a thick Wind Attribute aura.\n Breastplate, girdle and war kilt, two pieces of Consolidated Equipment in total, yet Shangguan Bing’er’s current cultivation level was at the sixth Jeweled stage [1. The original text says four Jewels, but all the explanations point to it being six]\n Zhou Weiqnig was a Consolidating Equipment Master in his own right, and with a single look he could tell that the wings behind Shangguan Bing’er’s back were not ordinary at all, actually made out of four Consolidated Equipment. It had to be known that those were all God Tier Consolidated Equipment! For the pair of wings to require four whole God Tier Consolidated Equipment to form, one could just imagine their strength. Furthermore, it looked like this was going to be an entire Legendary Set, perhaps nine pieces in total, or maybe even ten. Having been in closed door cultivation for three entire years, although her cultivation level had not reached the seventh Jeweled stage, it was clear that she was catching up to the rest of her sisters. Besides a freak like Zhou Weiqing, it was only the Heaven’s Expanse Palace which had the power to groom a Heavenly Jewel Master to such heights in just three short years, and even so, that must have taken an unimaginable amount of resouces.\n Seeing the dark gold light spring forth around the four girls almost simultaneously, each with their own gorgeous and brilliant Legendary Sets, added on Zhou Weiqing’s own ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set, the worry in his heart was mostly dispelled. It could be said that the five of them were the top of the entire young generation now, With the five of them working together, even if they met a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse, they should be able to take him down.\n “Fei’er, Bing’er, come here.” Zhou Weiqing beckoned towards Shangguan Fei’er and Shangguan Bing’er.\n Both girls headed towards him, and Shangguan Fei’er asked curiously: “What is it?”\n Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, come, let me kiss you.” As he said that, he did not even give her a chance to react as he pulled her into his embrace, kissing down onto her lips, which were opened from surprise.\n Although Shangguan Fei’er was known as the Little Demon Girl, being kissed forcefully in front of her sisters and Tian’er, how could she not be embarrassed. However, she quickly realised that Zhou Weiqing was not just trying to be intimate with her.\n A strange but thick and pure energy entered her mouth from Zhou Weiqing, and with a weird energy reverberation, she suddenly felt as if all of her pores opening at once, the soothing and comfortable feeling causing her eyes to widen in surprise, as she subconsciously put her arms around Zhou Weiqing’s neck and leaning into the kiss.\n Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing released her lips. “There isn’t anymore ohh… I’ll be squeezed dry like that, I still have to leave some for Bing’er.”\n Shangguan Fei’er looked at that wicked smirk right in front of her, but she was unable to retort at all, as the energy that had entered her body was slowly circulating around towards her DanTian.\n With a swipe of his arm, Zhou Weiqing pulled Shangguan Bing’er in his embrace. Similarly, kissing her red lips. She was even more embarrassed than Fei’er, trying to struggle free, but was tyrannically held in Zhou Weiqing’s arms.\n Saint Energy. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing was infusing them with some Saint Energy. Of course, though it was possible to transfer the Saint Energy by holding hands, how could Zhou Weiqing give up a perfect opportunity like that to righteously be intimate with them?\n After kissing Shangguan Bing’er and infusing her with Saint Energy as well, Zhou Weiqing restrained the wide smile on his face. In a serious tone, he said: “I have given each of you ten drops of Saint Energy, do not unwilling to use it or think it is a waste. When you use a Skill, if you infuse it with Saint Energy, it will greatly increase its power. This is not for you to attack enemies, but to protect yourselves. After all, the possible danger is just too great… but with the Saint Energy protecting you when you use any defensive Skills, you should have sufficient time to activate the Lustre Gem.”\n Shangguan Fei’er looked at him exasperatedly and said: “If you dare surprise attack me like that again, I’ll bite you!”\n Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, if I were to spread the news about giving ten drops of Saint Energy for a kiss, who knows how many girls will flock over. Even if the condition was to marry me, they would definitely agree.”\n As soon as he spoke those words, he was in big trouble, stirring up ‘public’ anger. Four angry glares fixed on him, and all of a sudden, Tian’er who had been silent for most of the time spoke up: “I’m afraid at that time, even men will flock over to look for you.”\n Zhou Weiqing also knew that he had spoken out of line, and he quickly put on a serious face, saying: “Come on, let’s head out.”\n The instant his words landed, all of a sudden, the dark red world seemed to surge violently, and a powerful force abruptly struck at them from the front.\n Zhou Weiqing was in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, and the Ice Cold Perception it gave him. In terms of cultivation level he might not be the highest, but his reaction was actually the fastest.\n His Dual Legendary hammers struck forward at once. Time was just too limited, and he did not have time to even use any Skills.\n A resounding explosion, and a loud resonant dragon’s cry rang out in their ears. Zhou Weiqing remained standing, but in front of him a golden red fire dragon had been sent flying back.\n However, Zhou Weiqing was not excited just because he had successfully blocked the attack. The golden red fire dragon was not a real dragon, just one formed out of pure energy.\n “Fire Spirit?” Both Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er exclaimed instantly. Zhou Weiqing did not recognize it, but the two girls who had come from a top level Great Saint Lands background instantly did.\n “Fire Spirit? What is that?” Zhou Weiqing asked subconsciously, even as he prepared himself for another attack from the fire dragon.\n Shangguan Xue’er said: “When there are flames that are raised to the maximum in both quality and quantity, it is possible to birth a Fire Spirit. They can be said to be the ultimate essence and core of the flames. Although they do not have any intelligence, they are able to instinctively attack any enemies which enter their territory. The concentration and potency of the flames here have actually reached such a degree.”\n As she spoke, the fire dragon once again charged towards the group. By now, the entire group could clearly see that the fire dragon was about a dozen metres long, baring teeth and fang aggressively. Besides being much smaller than a normal dragon, its appearance was no different from a real dragon.\n Having clashed with it earlier, Zhou Weiqing had a clearer picture of this fire dragon’s power. Its offensive strength was equal to that of an ordinary seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, and with the power of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set and its terrifying boost to his strength, he had been able knock the fire dragon back with relative ease. This time, however, he did not use his Legendary Hammers to face the incoming attack.\n Holding both hammers in his left hand, Zhou Weiqing grabbed outwards with his right hand right towards the incoming flying fire dragon in an abrupt move.\n The four girls only saw a sudden thick grey light burst forth from Zhou Weiqing’s body. In that instant, the dragon scaled tattoos around his body which appeared whenever he was in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation suddenly seemed to come to life. A thick grey swirl appeared in front of the fire dragon, and as it slammed into the grey, a strange dragon cry emitted from Zhou Weiqing’s mouth.\n With the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, Zhou Weiqing had the purest bloodline of Dragons in his blood, and this fire dragon was clearly formed from the flames that the Dragons had unleashed. With this dragon’s cry of Zhou Weiqing’s, it actually had a pretty good effect in restraining the fire dragon.\n In the next instant, the fire dragon was swallowed up by the grey whirlpool. The Legendary Hammers in Zhou Weiqing’s left hand suddenly disappeared as he grabbed Tian’er’s small hand. Next, the three Shangguan Sisters could clearly see that where the duo’s hands were connected had lit up with a silver white light.\n As soon as the fire dragon entered the grey whirlpool, it immediately began to struggle violently. Alas, it was facing Zhou Weiqing… the strongest Skill of the Demonic Attribute, the Devour Skill.\n Ever since Zhou Weiqing had gained the Saint Energy, especially after having summoned the Projection of the Demon God previously, his understanding of the Demonic Attribute and especially the Devour Skill had grown substantially, and he was growing to understand how truly tyrannical and powerful this Skill was.\n If it was only him alone here, he would naturally not take the risk to attempt to Devour such a massive amount of Fire Attribute energy. After all, such a massive amount of extremely pure Fire Attribute energy, even if he tried to devour it, it would take far too long to absorb and transform it, perhaps causing adverse side effects to his cultivation and body.\n However with the Saint Energy, especially with Tian’er’s aid, it was very different. Although his and Tian’er’s Saint Energy still could not be cultivated by themselves when they were alone, but when they joined hands to form the large Saint Energy whirlpool, any Attribute energy which entered it could only be absorbed, assimilated and then purified to become their own.\n Earlier, when they had taken the short rest in the Lustre Spatial Realm, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had already experienced the benefits of absorbing the thick fire attribute energies from the atmosphere, and how it had actually grown their Saint Energy. Currently, seeing that the fire dragon was not actually of real danger to them, how could Zhou Weiqing let go of such a perfect opportunity?\n This time, Zhou Weiqing only infused a single drop of Saint Energy into his Devour Skill. This was a new method of using the Saint Energy that he had just discovered not long ago. By only infusing a single drop of Saint Energy when he was doing so, instead of doing so uncontrolled, he would no longer experience the uncontrollable drain of Saint Energy for the powerful Skills.\n Even with just a single drop of Saint Energy, the power of the Devour Skill was greatly increased. Added on to the suppression of Zhou Weiqing’s bloodline, although the fire dragon was still struggling violently, it could not break free from the whirlpool of the Devour Skill no matter how hard it tried.\n Ever since his cultivation level had reached the sixth-Jewel stage, Zhou Weiqing no longer needed to touch his target with his palm to use the Devour Skill, and its power was slowly starting to really show itself.\n At the start, the struggles of the fire dragon could still give Zhou Weiqing a little bit of trouble, but as the Devour Skill began to take effect, the struggles grew weaker and weaker.\n By the time the fire dragon disappeared totally, both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had expressions of being pleasantly surprised on their faces. That was because just this seven-Jeweled fire dragon alone had actually given them twenty drops of Saint Energy… each! The ‘loss’ of Saint Energy from infusing to Fei’er and Bing’er had been recovered just like that.\n Zhou Weiqing’s expression turned strange as he laughed heartily: “It looks like… danger is often accompanied by opportunity as well!”\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-24-chapter-227-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
