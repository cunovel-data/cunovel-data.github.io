Shangguan Bing’er quickly grabbed hold of her. If she had to judge who was the most dangerous person in the entire Heavenly Bow Unit, it would definitely be the Snake Lady Transvestite Yi Shi. They often fought like that, and Shangguan Bing’er was rather used to it. “Alright, everyone. Enough!” Hua Feng shouted. The 2 ladies and 1 transvestite turned their gazes onto him; Hua Feng looked at Shangguan Bing’er and said: “Bing’er, have you finished Storing your third Skill?” Shangguan Bing’er nodded and said: “Yes, Teacher. I have accomplished it successfully.” Hua Feng nodded and said: “That’s great. You and Little Wei already have sufficient means of self protection. Both of you have already inherited our true secrets in archery, and the only thing you lack is more practice and experience on actual battlefields. You’ve already been here for almost 2 years, and it’s time to leave.” Shangguan Bing’er exclaimed in surprise: “Teacher, you want me and Little Fatty to leave?” Hua Feng said helplessly: “You’ve seen for yourself, when Little Wei, Mu En and Luo Ke Di get together, they have caused so much chaos for our Heavenly Bow Unit. My original intention was to leave you two for another few more months, but now it looks like it’ll be better for both of you to leave earlier. Otherwise, our Heavenly Bow Unit will be torn apart soon. It’s good that you are back now, both of you should pack up and leave tomorrow. Come with me, I have some things to tell you.” Shangguan Bing’er nodded. She was clear that her teacher never made decisions easily, but once he did, it would be extremely difficult to change his mind. As such, she followed Hua Feng into his wooden house, with a rather sad look in her eyes. Little Grass looked curiously at Yi Shi and said: “Is Boss really chasing that little brat Zhou Weiqing away?” Yi Shi replied: “Isn’t that what you hoped for? Why? Now that it happened, you can’t bear to see them go?” Little Grass combed her wet hair, muttering to herself: “Although that little brat is rather irritating, but with him around, don’t you think our Heavenly Bow Unit is filled with life and laughter?” Yi Shi let loose a giggle before laughing out loud: “Foolish girl, do you really think that Boss will chase them away just on your word? He has clearly planned this for a while.” “You’ve loved Boss for so long, how can you not know how he thinks? Although that little brat Zhou Weiqing is extremely sly and cunning, who amongst us isn’t jealous of his unbelievable talent? In just a short span of two years, he has actually managed to cultivate from the 5th level of Heavenly Jing Energy to the 11th Stage! Furthermore, he has mastered most of old scoundrel’s archery skills, and you should know that even if he continued staying here, he will not be able to learn much else from us. In the first place, with his talent, he would never be destined to stay for long in our Heavenly Bow Unit; Zhou Shui Niu still needs his son to take over his position eventually.” A hint of worry entered Little Grass’ eyes, and at this moment there was no hint of her usual fiery temple. “Indeed! Our Empire is indeed in worrying straits, especially now that the Bai Da Empire is giving Kalise more and more support. Although I dislike Zhou Shui Niu, I have to admit that without him, our Heavenly Bow Empire would have long been crushed.” Two years ago, after the battle with the Icy Soul Heavenly Bears, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er had awoken the other members of the Heavenly Bow Unit. They did not reveal the situation with the little white tiger, only telling Hua Feng and the rest that the four Icy Soul Heavenly Bears had just left all of a sudden. When they returned to the Heavenly Bow Unit Camp, they entered two years of tough training and cultivation. As for Zhou Weiqing, he mainly focused on the exquisitely painful yet unbelievably quick Immortal Deity Technique, while also learning Mu En’s various archery skills, of which he had by now all pretty much learnt. The most shocking thing to all the members was that within these two years, his Heavenly Energy had shot up by 6 whole levels, reaching a stunning 11th Level of Heavenly Energy. Even though Shangguan Bing’er was already considered a rare genius, she had only just reached the 12th level and gotten her third set of Heavenly Jewels, just reaching the Heavenly Shen Energy Stage. It seemed like Zhou Weiqing would quickly catch up. As such, to allow Zhou Weiqing to focus more on his archery skills, while also afraid that he would bite off more than he could chew and not accomplish anything, as a result, although he had already gotten his 2nd set of Heavenly Jewels, he had not been allowed to Consolidate Equipment or Store Skills as of yet. However, his personal power was already far above what he had been just two years ago. In fact, even now he could face off with Luo Ke Di, who still remained at the 5 Jewel Physical Master stage, without losing. As for the various Skills of his first Elemental Jewel, he was now able to use them freely and easily after much practice. The members of the Heavenly Bow Unit knew that not just Zhou Weiqing, but also Shangguan Bing’er, wouldn\u0027t remain for long at the Heavenly Bow Unit or Paradise Strange. As Heavenly Jewel Masters, they belonged on a much grander stage. … The next day. Dawn. Front gates of the Heavenly Bow Unit Camp. Heavenly Bow Unit Leader, Ultimate Assassin - Hua Feng, Vice Leader, Snake Lady Transvestite - Yi Shi, Female Volcano - Little Grass, Arrow Tower - Han Mo, Cannon - Gao Shen, Drunken Rogue - Luo Ke Di and God Eye Scoundrel - Mu En, were all standing in a row. In front of them stood two youths, one male and one female. The female was of course Shangguan Bing’er, and there were tears brimming in her eyes, with an expression full of reluctance to part. The male by her side, standing at almost 1.9m tall, looking as fit as a young bull, was Zhou Weiqing, a rather sad look on his face as well; the honest looking expression on his face was a lot more realistic than before. Atop Zhou Weiqing shoulders stood the little white tiger, looking no different from two years ago. It still had the same lazy look as before, but if someone examined it closely and carefully, they would notice that the colour of its eyes had changed, from the previous blue to a light purple. Its brilliant white fur now seemed like they were carved from crystal, and if it stood there unmoving, some might even mistake it for a perfect sculpture. Right behind Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er, a pair of black bears with gold fur on their backs lay on the ground. The two fellows were no longer little, their bodies grown to over 2 metres long and were large and stout, especially with their large heads causing them to look charmingly simple and naive. However, if any Jewel Masters spotted them, it would definitely be terror that sparked in them. After all, they were Icy Soul Heavenly Bears! Even if they were still very young, the two bears were already Zun Stage Heavenly Beasts. In truth, the Icy Soul Heavenly Bears’ growth rate shouldn’t have been so fast. The two had grown more than ten years worth of growing in just these two years. Regarding this, the members of the Heavenly Bow Unit were all puzzled as well, but despite their efforts, they were unable to find out the reason for this. Hua Feng gave a light smile and said to Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er: “All good things must come to an end. You both have learnt much in your two years in our Heavenly Bow Unit. I hope that no matter what happens in the future, no matter how powerful you become, you will never forget that your motherland is our Heavenly Bow Empire.” Shangguan Bing’er nodded vigorously, saying: “Teacher, do not worry. For me and Little Fatty, everything we have is given by the motherland. We will not let you down!” Little Grass said exasperatedly: “Brother Feng, what type of situation is this, yet you are still talking about those big ideals. Bing’er is the kindest, gentlest girl I know, why would she need you to talk about all of that? Bing’er come, let Big Sis hug you.” As she said that, she opened her arms and gave Shangguan Bing’er a big warm hug. At that point, Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t resist any longer and tears flowed down her cheeks as she hugged Little Grass in return, her head resting on Little Grass’ shoulders as she sobbed. Little Grass’ eyes were also misty with tears. After a while, the two separated, and right at that moment, Luo Ke Di opened his arms and hugged Shangguan Bing’er as well. “I want a hug too!” Indeed, he managed to hug… alas, it wasn’t Shangguan Bing’er who he hugged, but someone much larger than him, with an honest look on his face - Zhou Weiqing. Luo Ke Di felt as if his bones were creaking after being bear hugged by Zhou Weiqing, and couldn’t help but scold out loud: “Damn, you little brat, let go of me!” Only then did Zhou Weiqing let go of Luo Ke Di, saying with concerned: “Shi Shu, are you alright? I’m just about to leave, I’m just so touched.” Luo Ke Di gave a humph and said: “Stop acting you little brat! I, Your Father, just wanted a hug from Bing’er, it’s not like she will lose anything.” Zhou Weiqing nodded his head repeatedly, saying: “Little Grass Elder Sis is allowed to hug, but you aren’t. As long as it’s female, even if it’s a sow, your hugs could possibly impregnate it! Shi Shu, don’t forget that your nickname is Rogue! The Ultimate Rogue!” “You…” Luo Ke Di cried out in anger, jumping up and wanting to teach Zhou Weiqing a lesson. Alas, at the distance they were at, he could only hold back. After all, Zhou Weiqing’s strength now was indeed too terrifying, with two Pure Strength Physical Jewels boosting him, just comparing strength alone he was already a match for Mu En, who was a half strength Physical Jewel Master with 6 Jewels! Although Zhou Weiqing’s Physical Jewel was a pure strength Jewel, and his boost should be 1.5 times that of an ordinary Physical Jewel Master[1. that means it should be 3 times that of Mu En, who is half Strength. 1x6 \u003d 3x2, by my calculations it should actually be equal \u003dp I might be mistaking it though.], this shouldn’t have happened. However, his strength had also been increased by the black pearl he swallowed, and during the two years of growth, his entire physique had grown by an impressive amount. Normally, during breaks and when he was feeling bored, he played and wrestled with the two baby Icy Soul Heavenly Bears, and in a 1v2 situation! “Little Wei.” Han Mo walked up to him. He was not a man of many words, and he just gave Zhou Weiqing a hug. “Live Well.” Zhou Weiqing also grew more serious, keeping his joking smile and hugging him back. “I will.” Gao Shen walked over next and also gave him a hug. “Little Wei, remember to kill more people. Men should have more killing intent to be more manly!” He was followed by Yi Shi, but Zhou Weiqing refused to let ‘her’ hug him, causing ‘her’ to pout angrily. Mu En and Hua Feng also walked over. Hua Feng patted Shangguan Bing’er’s head, smiling faintly as he said: “Teacher will always be proud of you.” “Teacher!” Shangguan Bing’er could no longer control her emotions, and dove into Hua Feng’s arms, crying. Zhou Weiqing could only watch from the side, eyebrows twitching, but resisted the urge to do anything. “Stop looking, little brat. In the future, if you go out and get bullied, you better not let anyone know you’re my disciple!” Mu En said with a humph. Zhou Weiqing said carefully: “Teacher… it’s not like being your disciple is something of high honour or reputation!” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-5-chapter-33-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis] In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
