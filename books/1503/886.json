Lastly, Zhou Weiqing looked over at Tian’er, who had been staring at him all this while but did not approach him. “My beloved……” Tian’er looked at Zhou Weiqing, “I know you better than they do, so you don’t have to persuade me. You have no reason to do so either. I possess Saint Energy as well - if you’re allowed to contribute to the Mainland, why can’t I?” “However, you are pregnant with our child!” Zhou Weiqing forced a smile as he said that. Tian’er replied indifferently, “Even so, I do not want our child to be born without a father. If that is the case, I’d rather the three of us die together. You don’t have to say anything else - if you stop me from following you by force, or if you knock me out, I will kill myself immediately the moment I wake up, whether or not you come back alive. You know my temper well.” “You……” Zhou Weiqing was at a loss for words and stared blankly at Tian’er - he did not know how to react. In truth, amongst all the women, the person who knew Zhou Weiqing best was Tian’er. They had spent the most time cultivating together, and they created Saint Energy together as well. Hence, they shared a telepathic connection. Seeing how Zhou Weiqing dealt with the other women, naturally, Tian’er had thought of a countermeasure. Zhou Weiqing looked helplessly towards Xue AoTian, hinting to him to back him up. However, Xue AoTian gently shook his head at him, “Even though Tian’er is my daughter, I support her on this matter. If we possessed Saint Energy and could be of help to you, I would have gone with you as well. Weiqing, frankly speaking, you do not have to overthink too much. You have to understand that if all of you do not succeed, this world will most likely cease to exist. At the very most, we will survive for just a little while more. With Tian’er’s help, your chances of success will be higher. Take her with you. We will wait here for your good news. No matter how tough the situation is, you must be confident. We will wait for your triumphant return.” Zhou Weiqing silently nodded his head. He said solemnly to Xue AoTian, “Even if we have to die, I will definitely die before Tian’er does. I will sacrifice my life to protect her.” A hint of relief could be seen in Xue AoTian’s eyes, “I believe you.” At this moment, the Sidhe Empress had gradually opened her eyes. The twelve Sidhe elders were waiting by her side, with a worried look on their faces. Similarly, they knew for a fact that the Sidhe Empress might not necessarily make it back alive this time. The Sidhe Empress was after all the most powerful ruler for the past ten thousand years, and had brought them great hope. Moreover, the lives of all the Sidhe Empresses were connected to the Ancient Tree of Life. In the event that the Sidhe Empress died, the Ancient Tree of Life would wither as well. A new Sidhe Queen would have to connect her bloodline with it before it could be revived again. However, even if that was the case, the Ancient Tree of Life that had undergone evolution would disappear. The new Ancient Tree of Life would return to its initial stage. In the eyes of the Sidhe Tribe, this was definitely not a good news. Looking at the elders, the Sidhe Empress let out a faint sigh, “You have heard the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord’s words. When the nest is overturned, no eggs can remain unbroken. If we cannot stop the Lord of the Nether, we will not be able to continue surviving in this world. If we fail this mission, then there’s nothing else we can say. If I die after we succeeded, you will have to follow according to my agreement with Zhou Weiqing - take the Sidhe Tribe to the Heavenly Bow Empire and live there. The Peerless Sect will take care of everyone. When that time comes, let my daughter take over the throne.” “Your Majesty.” All twelve Sidhe elders knelt down in the sky. Their voices were full of sorrow. The Sidhe Empress smiled and said, “There is a beginning and end to every life. Moreover, there is a chance that I might not die. Weiqing is the main combat force - I am only assisting from the side at most. As long as we are able to suppress the Lord of the Nether and strengthen the seal, our mission will be complete. Alright, we have to rush over. Or else, once the seal gets broken, it will be too late by then.” The emerald green light dwindled, causing the six wings on the Sidhe Empress’ back to turn into the same shade as well. Her figure flashed and in the next moment, she emerged once again next to Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er. Two resonant dragon roars were heard; with a heart filled with hatred, Hui Yao and Duo Si flew over to where Zhou Weiqing and company were at. Hui Yao said in a deep voice, “I will carry all of you there. We will work together and no matter what, we cannot let the Lord of the Nether have his way.” Looking at Hui Yao’s blood red eyes, Zhou Weiqing sighed to himself. However, at this moment, he could not say anything to console him further. After all, the grief in the hearts of both the husband and wife was way too intense. “Let’s go,” said Zhou Weiqing in a deep voice. As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing held Tian’er’s hand and nimbly landed on Hui Yao’s head. On the other hand, the Sidhe Empress landed on Duo Si’s head. Once again, the two enormous dragons let out a roar; an intense fire red light was emitted from each of their bodies. Carrying Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er and the Sidhe Empress, they turned around and flew directly into the huge abyss, and vanished in the blink of an eye. Nobody uttered a single word. Led by Shangguan Tianyang, Xue AoTian and Long Shiya, all the powerhouses gradually closed their eyes, as they silently prayed for them in their hearts. Without a doubt, they were very clear that it was impossible for Zhou Weiqing to defeat the Lord of the Nether. Hence, they could only pray for the seal to be successfully strengthened. They flew into the abyss; the surrounding air immediately became chilly. Fortunately, due to Hui Yao and Duo Si’s intense Fire Element, they managed to dispel the cold. Zhou Weiqing and company felt comfortably warm. “Weiqing.” Hui Yao’s voice suddenly rang in his ear. “What’s the matter, Hui Yao?” Initially when he first met Hui Yao, he was still an extremely weak ordinary Heavenly Jewel master. However, right now, he had become a Max Level Heavenly God, just like Hui Yao. Not to forget, he was Max Level heavenly God who possessed the Saint God Core Nucleus! Hui Yao used a very deep voice and solemnly said to Zhou Weiqing, “Weiqing, I know for a fact that I might never be able to avenge my children in this lifetime. Ever since I met you, you had helped us several times before. Additionally, every single time you were with us, we managed to solve our problems. What I am trying to say is that, if you, who possessed the Saint Energy, have the opportunity to kill the Lord of the Nether, please do your best to kill him. If you managed to kill him and help avenge our children, from now on, Duo Si and I are willing to be your servants and spend the rest of our lives protecting you and your offsprings, until the end of time.” Zhou Weiqing shuddered; He could sense the determination, resolute and helplessness in Hui Yao’s voice. Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath and replied slowly, “I will make an all-out effort to the best of my ability.” “Thank you,” said Hui Yao, whose voice was trembling slightly. After their conversation ended, both of them did not say anything else. Zhou Weiqing settled down and calmly observed the surroundings. The enormous cave was approximately more than a thousand meters wide. Hence, despite Hui Yao and Duo Si’s huge bodies, they could fly side by side with ease. The walls of the cave were dark gray. Albeit faintly, the presence of Destructive Energy could be felt. The cave was evidently not man-made, however, it seemed as though it was forcefully opened up by a powerful force. Zhou Weiqing looked towards the Sidhe Empress, who was sitting on Duo Si’s head, and asked, “We’re about to face that fella soon, please tell me more about him. After all, I don’t know any concrete details about him. How did he appear in the first place?” The Sidhe Empress nodded and said, “Come to think of it, the cause of the appearance of the Lord of the Nether could be traced back to the human beings. “Human beings?” Zhou Weiqing was puzzled. The Sidhe Empress nodded and continued, “Yes, when the Lord of the Nether first appeared, he did not have a living body. To put it more accurately, he was a formidable existence that was create from the evolution of an energy body to a living one. “Then what kind of energy body was he? Where did the Destructive Energy come from?” The Sidhe Empress replied, “It came from the negative emotions belonging to human beings. It mainly came from resentment, hatred, fear, bloodlust, etc. All these negative emotions merged together to form Destructive Energy.” Looking at the disbelief in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, she continued, “It’s hard to believe, isn’t it? Or perhaps, you are thinking that it’s somewhat too much for me to put the blame on human beings. However, in truth, the Destructive Energy was formed from the negative human emotions. In ancient times, the main rulers of the Mainland were the Dragon Tribe and the Sidhe Tribe. At that time, even though we had wars, they were very minimal. Furthermore, there weren’t that many feuds and schemes between us, compared to the human beings. Quantity was the most important thing. “The Sidhe Tribe and the Dragon Tribe were once powerful in the past. Even during the peak of our glory, our population was only 0.0001% of your population now. We are envious, or even jealous, of the human beings’ ability to reproduce. The more conflicts and schemes there are amongst human beings, there will naturally be more negative emotions.” “At the beginning, these negative emotions were only being given off by the human beings. However, as the negative emotions accumulated, they triggered some energy to mutate and hence opening up a tiny space. We called it the Resentment Space in ancient times. When it first appeared, it was extremely tiny, to the extent that nobody could detect it. However as the human beings gradually became more powerful and eventually became the ruler of the Mainland, wars and massacres continued to happen. Thus, it caused the Resentment Space to become bigger and bigger. When we had finally noticed its existence, it had already created its own consciousness, and that is the Lord of the Nether.” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-302-2","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis] In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
