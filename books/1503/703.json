(1)","content":"One was the governor’s son, another was the son of the W’Batu Financial Chief and the last fellow was the son of a great merchant. Not only did the Heavenly Jewel Masters below the stage recognize their identity, they were also aware of the strength of these three. After calming down, they became quite puzzled. Why was it that these three guys with such different battle capabilities could stay on the stage? Er Chun’s expression became quite unsightly. He naturally knew that the longer this went on, his sham regarding the trial selection would be easily exposed. Alas, there was nothing he could do. He used eighty percent strength earlier with that fist. For the guise of fairness, he simply couldn’t use more heavenly power because the spectating Heavenly Jewel Masters weren’t fools. Even though the XuanTian Palace on this continent had supreme authority, his own position wasn’t that high, nor was he in charge of everything. If this matter were to be exposed, it would require an exorbitant amount of money to quell it. The losses did not make up for the gains. After thinking it through, Er Chun decided to try one last time. If he still couldn’t do it, he could only apologize to those paying fellows. As he thought about it, he said in a leisurely tone: “Very good indeed, I am very happy and gratified to see you guys passing the third examination. Unfortunately, there are only three final spots, so, among you four, one must be eliminated. This next round is added by me for this purpose after deliberation, to be held between the four of you. I have thought of the best way for everyone to show their strength. By drawing lots, we’ll decide the order of testing. The first chosen will be attacked by the other three to see how long they could last, and so on so forth. Just like that, the competitor who lasts the shortest amount of time against the others will be eliminated.” Zhou Weiqing stared amusingly at this Er Chun in his clumsy attempts to come up with a way to eliminate him. He decided to play along with the guy and didn’t reveal anything. Er Chun continued, “Everyone knows that a Heavenly Jewel Master can’t use his full strength in a regular bout. Because of this, I will allow for everyone to go all out. As the judge, when I think someone can’t handle it any longer, I will personally stop the fight. Okay, draw the lots now.” Having said that, he turned towards the main platform and signaled at governor Sang Tan. The two knew each other for a while now so Sang Tan understood his intention right away, while being secretly excited. This Er Chun guy might take an exorbitant fee but he was still quite capable. The only type to be afraid of are those bastards who take the payment yet fail to carry out their promise. My son might not be capable at all but if it is a three-on-one scenario, there should be no need to worry about taking that brat down. Sure enough, after the drawing, Zhou Weiqing became the ‘lucky’ guy to go first against the surrounding attacks of the other three. During this process of drawing lots, Er Chun used Weiqing’s blind spot and gave the other three a sharp glare. These young masters weren’t fools either so how could they not understand his meaning? Moreover, since they had been chosen by their respective clans to be groomed, though they were rather foppish, they definitely still had their own capabilities. Weiqing didn’t cry foul. After all, the entire thing had a guise of fairness over it. Even though many of the Heavenly Jewel Masters below could see that there was a problem, they were at most just angry without daring to speak up. Er Chun stepped to the side and nodded his head towards Weiqing: “Young man, it is time to show off all your strength. Remember, with my protection, everyone is safe so no need to worry. Begin.” Weiqing was mumbling curses in his mind. This old bastard, even at this point, he didn’t forget to remind these young masters to kill me. Once they have killed me off, all he needed to do would be to give the excuse that he wasn’t able to take action on time and just act apologetic. Only three would be left once Weiqing was dead and there was no need to continue this competition. All three would naturally entered the final round. Such craftiness, huh! Plus, no one would criticize him for the sake of a dead kid even after it was exposed. Unfortunately for Er Chun, it was Zhou Weiqing he was scheming against this time. How could he know that this youth ahead was the number one among the young generation of the Boundless Mainland, whose cultivation was even higher than his. The three young masters immediately surrounded Weiqing on three sides after hearing the order, summoning out their Consolidated Equipment without hesitation. Everything else aside, all three of these fellows actually had five full pieces of Consolidated Equipment. Sang De had the best among them, actually having a five piece Set. Besides a long sword as his weapon, he also had a chestplate, helm, waist protector, and a pair of gauntlets. This was a relatively decent set. The other two were a bit inferior but they at least had all five that their cultivation level could support currently. They three fellows all knew each other and this wasn’t their first time scheming against someone else. Sang De and another spear-user shouted before attacking Weiqing in unison. Sang De’s Elemental Jewel was of the Wind Attribute, and his long sword was accompanied with a Wind Blade. On the surface, it seemed like it was pretty powerful, with a strong presence, and its area of effect was quite wide as well. His cultivation might be unstable but under the empowerment of his Consolidated Equipment, his destructive capability was fairly extraordinary. On the platform, Sang Tan watched his son showing his abilities on the stage with a satisfied smile. The other young master with the spear had the Fire Attribute for his Elemental Jewel. His flame synergized with Sang De’s Wind Attribute attacks as he thrusted his spear at Weiqing’s stomach. Along with his Agility Physical Jewel, his speed and destructive power was not bad at all. Their Consolidated Equipment weren’t bad either but in terms of their fighting capabilities and especially Stored Skills, it was rather lacking. Weiqing understood that this had something to do with their willpower. There was an integral relationship between a Heavenly Jewel Master and their willpower in terms of their success rate of Storing Skills. The stronger the willpower, the greater the chance for success. But for these foppish young masters, what willpower do they have to speak of? Nevertheless, they were wily enough. Two of them launched a direct frontal assault while the guy behind Weiqing didn’t make a single sound. He wielded an obsidian knife and slithered on the ground like a poisonous snake in order to close his distance in silence. This was their real killing move. This was a Stored Skill from a Serpent Type Heavenly Beast, with extremely effective stealth effects. Moreover, his Elemental Jewel Attribute was the Darkness Attribute, and it was a very synergistical combination. These three normally conspired against others together so their teamwork was quite good.
