Just as he was preparing to give the order to kill them all, a shrill voiced suddenly shrieked out. “Weiqing, don’t! Bing’er isn’t dead!” The voice was followed by two figures charging out of Xuantian Palace at high speed, and they immediately moved over to Dong Fang and the four Grand Elders. This time, it was Zhou Weiqing’s turn to be dazed. Although his gaze had become clouded by bloodlust, he was still able to clearly see who had just come flying out of Xuantian Citadel. Dongfang Hanyue was dressed in a long green dress, and next to her was Shangguan Bing’er in a long white dress. It looked like she was perfectly fine and as beautiful as always. Dongfang Hanyue pulled Shangguan Bing’er forwards, her beautiful eyes wide open in shock. All of this was technically due to a misunderstanding. When Zhou Weiqing had arrived here and started to shout, Dongfang Hanyue had heard him from within Xuantian Citadel. She didn’t realize that Zhou Weiqing already knew for certain that something had happened to Shangguan Bing’er. When she heard him shouting like that, she felt a bit angry. She had given him the most precious thing she had. Did he still view her as being less worthy than his wife? And so, she didn’t immediately emerge. In addition, just yesterday Dong Fang and the other four Grand Elders had already acceded to Dongfang Hanyue’s suggestion of releasing Shangguan Bing’er. Dongfang Hanyue had casually strolled over to Shangguan Bing’er. When she saw Shangguan Bing’er, she even joked to Bing’er and told her not to rush out right away. They wanted to make that bad man feel impatient and anxious for a time. She had been afraid that Shangguan Bing’er would hold a grudge, and so she had spent quite a bit of time over the past two days chatting with her. The two had discussed many things, but she had forgotten to return Shangguan Bing’er’s Spatial Ring to her. This was why Zhou Weiqing hadn’t been able to reach Shangguan Bing’er this entire time. This all took time to describe, but in truth mere moments had passed between Zhou Weiqing first arriving at Xuantian Citadel and the two great dragons being summoned. By the time Dongfang Hanyue led Shangguan Bing’er in speeding out of Xuantian Citadel, Zhou Weiqing’s side was already prepared for war. The words ‘kill them all’ were stuck inside Zhou Weiqing’s throat, unable to come out. It must be remembered that both Hui Yao and Duo Si had flared their auras and were waiting for the signal. Once he actually ordered for them to kill everyone before him, they would carry it out without hesitation. That terrifying suppressive aura continued to hang in the air, but Zhou Weiqing just stared wide-eyed. The ancient, deathly aura emanating him melted away like frost in the sun, while the redness in his eyes gradually receded as well. Bing’er isn’t dead. Bing’er isn’t dead. Zhou Weiqing was unable to control himself, and his tears began to slide down his face while his body began to shake even harder. “Give Bing’er back to me and I’ll spare you,” Zhou Weiqing said hoarsely. His voice didn’t sound threatening at all… but he had those two great dragons by his side. Dongfang Hanyue finally came back to her senses. When she looked at Zhou Weiqing’s pathetic, sniveling face, she couldn’t help but feel a sourness in her heart. She forgot that she was the Xuantian Palace Lord and, in this moment, became nothing more than a little girl. If I was the one who was in trouble, would he be this anxious? “I refuse. Go ahead and kill me.” Dongfang Hanyue raised her head and stared coldly at Zhou Weiqing. Zhou Weiqing was dazed. When he saw that Shangguan Bing’er was fine, he suddenly went through yet another mood swing, soaring from the depths of depression to the heights of joy. By now, he no longer felt that much enmity. When he heard Dongfang Hanyue refuse, he actually didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know how he was supposed to handle this situation. Only, when he saw that stubborn look on her face he couldn’t help but feel a bit sorry for her. In the end, it was Shangguan Bing’er who resolved this deadlock. “Little Fatty, what the hell are you doing? Hanyue has been treating me wonderfully. I’m fine!” As she spoke, she summoned her Wings of the Wind God and flew over towards Zhou Weiqing. Clearly, no one was going to stop her. Dong Fang and the four Grand Elders had completely shut up. They could clearly sense that if anything was to actually happen to Shangguan Bing’er, Zhou Weiqing probably really would’ve ordered these two enormous great dragons to level Xuantian Citadel. No matter how crafty they were, they had no solutions for dealing with these two leviathans. The Wings of the Wind God were incredibly fast, allowing Shangguan Bing’er to almost instantly appear before Zhou Weiqing. Ignoring the fact that so many people were present, Zhou Weiqing immediately pulled her into his arms while using both hands to roam around her body shamelessly. Only after making sure that she was completely unharmed did he finally and truly relax. Even though many people were watching, Shangguan Bing’er didn’t resist in the slightest. She just tightly held onto his waist, pressing her face tightly against his chest. Although she and Dongfang Hanyue had arrived just moments ago, the conversation outside the citadel had been carried out using Heavenly Energy. Thus, even inside the citadel she knew exactly what was happening. For her sake, this man had been willing to face down the entire Xuantian Palace. He was going to bathe it in blood, all by himself. How could she not feel moved? This was her man, her Little Fatty! Dongfang Hanyue stared at Zhou Weiqing, who was standing atop the enormous head of Hui Yao. Her eyes couldn’t help but redden, because she knew that a few days from now she might never see this man again. She was jealous of Shangguan Bing’er, jealous of the fact that she could be with him while Dongfang Hanyue herself had to shoulder all those responsibilities by herself. Her father’s legacy, Xuantian Palace’s future… they were the heaviest shackles she had to bear. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er cuddled together for quite some time before slowly separating. None of the Xuantian Palace powerhouses actually dared to disturb them. The awesome presence of the two Heavenly God-level great dragons was simply too terrifying. At a time like this, they no longer worried about Xuantian Palace’s face. They were worried about Xuantian Palace’s continued survival. “Little Fatty, you were wrong in blaming big sister Hanyue. She treated me very well and she told me many things. Previously, Xuantian Palace did in fact temporarily confine me to my quarters because they weren’t certain as to why we had come, but they didn’t hurt me. When big sister Hanyue heard the news, she immediately came back to persuade them otherwise. I was planning to come out and search for you today.” Zhou Weiqing scratched his head, sighing mentally to himself. He felt as though his life was changing far too rapidly. He then turned to stare at the distant Dongfang Hanyue, feeling rather awkward. “So, uh, Hanyue… um… I guess this was a misunderstanding?” Zhou Weiqing stuttered. Dongfang Hanyue bit her lower lips, struggling to prevent her tears from falling down. However, she simply couldn’t stop them. Zhou Weiqing spread his wings and flew towards Xuantian Palace. The great dragons Hui Yao and Duo Si simply remained where they were, waiting for him. They were certain that no one would dare to cause trouble for Zhou Weiqing with them present. Shangguan Bing’er didn’t head over, she just remained on Hui Yao’s head, a rather odd look on her face. Dongfang Hanyue hadn’t held anything back in her talks with Shangguan Bing’er, including what had happened between her and Zhou Weiqing and the feelings she felt for him. At first, Shangguan Bing’er had blamed Zhou Weiqing for this. No matter how gentle she was, she was still a woman… and she had two sisters back home! This Little Fatty, he really does have a lover in every port. Even when he goes to a different continent, he still won’t stop! But when Zhou Weiqing had risked everything to challenge Xuantian Palace today, that bit of resentment vanished from her heart. Now, she actually sympathized with Dongfang Hanyue. Dongfang Hanyue was Xuantian Palace’s Palace Lord. There was naturally no way she could return with Zhou Weiqing to the Boundless Mainland. She liked him, but she couldn’t be together with him. This was the most agonizing type of feeling there was. In comparison, Bing’er was much more fortunate. Dong Fang and the four Grand Elders were now thing more than spectators. In truth, they mostly felt admiration for Dongfang Hanyue. Even though she might’ve guided by her feelings, her evaluation of Zhou Weiqing was spot on. Who would’ve imagined that this young man could actually summon two great dragons? If it hadn’t been for Dongfang Hanyue bringing Shangguan Bing’er out, there would probably be no way to return from what was about to happen. Xuantian Palace’s foundation, built up over thousands of years, probably would have been completely destroyed! Shangguan Bing’er was now back by Zhou Weiqing’s side, metaphorically speaking. Judging from the looks of things, this wasn’t going to result in a fight after all. Dong Fang let out a slight sigh, then waved her hand and led the four Grand Elders back into Xuantian Citadel. She did this partially because their presence here was superfluous, and partially to show that Xuantian Citadel didn’t have any hostility towards Zhou Weiqing. Dong Fang wasn’t a fool. Letting Dongfang Hanyue chat privately with Zhou Weiqing was actually the best choice right now.
