He placed his hands together and the white incandescent light continuously rushed out from it. This was definitely the most powerful attack from Zhou Weiqing. In that instant, he felt as though he was touching the edge of the Heavenly Change Stage. Even though it was not the actual Heavenly Change Stage, that feeling itself had given him a confidence boost. However, very quickly, this confidence had turned into shock. The black and white incandescent lights collided in the air in an instant. The black light had the upper hand by overwhelming the white incandescent light, causing it to retreat and return into Zhou Weiqing’s body at a rapid speed. The gloomy light of the Eye of Destruction shot towards Zhou Weiqing swiftly, carrying an irresistible loftiness. Also, at this moment, the Lord of the Nether’s body seemed to be more illusory-like. One could well imagine how much the Eye of Destruction took a toll on his body, in order to allow his attack to be that terrifying and powerful. Zhou Weiqing had condensed all the energy from himself, Tian’er, as well as the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set. Even then, he was still unable to break off the ray of light that came from the Eye of Destruction. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s face had gone pale. He could clearly sense the Destructive Energy that was rushing towards him. Anyone would be afraid of death. Looking at the pitch-black ray of light that was approaching him, closer and closer, Zhou Weiqing’s full potential had erupted. It seemed as though the rich white incandescent light was about to combust his body; the incandescent flame ascended, causing Zhou Weiqing to be completely immersed within it. Indeed, under such a circumstance where Zhou Weiqing could perish at any moment, he ignited his Life Flame. Only in doing so would he be able to raise the power of his attack. At this moment, the ray of light from the Eye of Destruction had come to the front of the Saint God Core Nucleus. Within the incandescent light that had suddenly soared, there seemed to be a faint tinge of soft milky white light. Its appearance had caused the light of the Eye of Destruction to halt right in front of Zhou Weiqing’s chest, just an inch away from the Saint God Core Nucleus. The Lord of the Nether’s eyes twitched slightly before he said in a cold manner, “Combusting your Life Flame huh? I want to see just how much Life you’re able to combust. Under the light of my Eye of Destruction, your life will diminish at an even more rapid speed.” He was not exaggerating - even though Zhou Weiqing had relied on the combustion of his Life Energy to greatly boost his attack in an instant, at the same time, he could sense that his life was being depleted at an alarming rate. In almost a split second, Zhou Weiqing was able to sense how it felt like to age. His head full of black hair had become white. His vitality was being intensely depleted. Even so, he was able to resist the attack, albeit with much difficulty. However, how much longer was he able to withstand it for? Tian’er hovered behind Zhou Weiqing. As she personally watched how Zhou Weiqing’s head full of black hair had become white, in that moment, it seemed as though her heart was about to shatter. However, there was absolutely nothing she could do. At this moment, even though her cultivation base was at the Low Level Heavenly God Stage, it was of no help to Zhou Weiqing. Even if she were to combust her Saint Energy, it was impossible for her to help Zhou Weiqing resist the attack from the Eye of Destruction. Little Fatty, Little Fatty…… Tears clouded Tian’er’s vision. At this moment, she was in despair. Outside the seal. Hui Yao and Duo Si had not returned. After all, it required a considerable amount of time to fly from the seal of the Netherworld to the outside of the abyss and back again. It had only been barely fifteen minutes since Zhou Weiqing was captured by the Lord of the Nether. Right now, the Sidhe Empress was the most anxious. Her beautiful face had gone pale a long time ago. She had been sensing her Saint Energy in silence. Her life connection with Zhou Weiqing was not bound by time and space. Even though she was anxious, her face still looked very calm. This was because she was very clear that if Zhou Weiqing were to die, it was impossible for her to survive on her own. The feeling of sharing life and death with a human man caused her emotions to be extremely complicated. Furthermore, for some reason, it seemed as though Zhou Weiqing had occupied an irreplaceable place in her heart. Can he come back alive? Agony could be seen on the Sidhe Empress’ face. Without a doubt, the probability of Zhou Weiqing coming back alive was close to zero. It was the Netherworld after all; over there, one could well imagine how powerful the Lord of the Nether was. Zhou Weiqing’s attributes were already being suppressed, let alone his cultivation base. At this moment, all of a sudden, the Sidhe Empress’ body swayed. She had a horrified look on her face, as she could clearly sense that her Life Energy was being exhausted at an alarming rate. Weiqing, it is Zhou Weiqing. His Life Energy had already been exhausted to the point where the Sidhe Empress’ Life Energy started to get consumed. At this moment, the Sidhe Empress experienced chills - the inevitable had happened in the end. Zhou Weiqing being able to survive in the Netherworld for fifteen minutes was already something to be proud of. However, the end result was still the same. Distress appeared on the Sidhe Empress’ face, as she gradually sat cross-legged. Be it her or the Ancient Tree of Life behind her, they started to release a rich emerald green light that transformed into rays of dense energy ripples that silently vanished. Indeed, Zhou Weiqing had started consuming the Sidhe Empress’ Life Energy. When his hair had completely become white, it signified that his Life Energy was almost entirely exhausted. It had depleted at such a terrifying speed! After all, Zhou Weiqing was a Heavenly God powerhouse right now - he had even touched the threshold of the Heavenly Change Stage. Even so, in the face of the Eye of Destruction, his Life Energy was still being depleted at such a rapid speed. “Eh?” The Lord of the Nether let out a puzzled voice. He had already calculated perfectly beforehand that Zhou Weiqing should have collapsed in the next moment. However, for some reason, a bout of tenacious Life Energy was still being emitted from Zhou Weiqing’s body, and continued to combust and resisted the light of the Eye of Destruction, not allowing the pitch-black light to engulf him. Defying his judgment once again, the Lord of the Nether grimaced. The Eye of Destruction might be powerful, however, it also consumed a massive amount of his original Destructive Energy! If this were to continue he would not have much energy left. However, at this moment, he had no other choice as well. Only by killing Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, would other possibilities be opened up to him. Zhou Weiqing’s fuzzy eyes widened slightly - he had sensed the sudden massive Life Energy pouring out from his heart to every inch of his body. The supply of the Life Energy was unending. At the same time, a beautiful image appeared within his heart. It is the SIdhe Empress. This is the Life Energy that I share with her, as well as the Ancient Tree of Life’s. However, the consumption of the Life Energy is too rapid. If this goes on, they will die together with me! Zhou Weiqing’s heart was filled with bitter agony. However, he no longer had the ability to change anything. Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Empress were destined to die together because they shared a life together. What else could he do? Pray for the Lord of the Nether’s Destructive Energy to run out? This was clearly not realistic. Not only did the Eye of Destruction not show signs of weakening, instead, it continuously became stronger, causing his Life Energy that was combusting within his body to vanish at an alarming rate. “Little Fatty…” At this moment, a trembling voice rang in Zhou Weiqing’s ears. In the next moment, he saw Tian’er. Due to the fact that the incandescent Saint Energy that was combusting around Zhou Weiqing was too strong, it was already impossible for Tian’er to have any contact with his body. However, since they shared a telepathic connection, Tian’er was able to sense that the Life Energy within Zhou Weiqing was about to be completely depleted at any moment. “Little Fatty…” Tian’er gently called out to him. “I don’t want to watch you die. I’m sorry, Little Fatty, please forgive me. Our son and I will take our leave first. We will be waiting for you in another world.” “Don’t! Tian’er!” Zhou Weiqing cried out in a frenzy in his heart. However, at this moment, there was absolutely nothing he could do - he was even unable to let out any sound. All he could do was watch Tian’er’s body fly towards the Destructive light. Indeed, Tian’er had already made a decision to be selfish. She could not bear to watch the man she loved the most to die before her eyes. Hence, she would rather die before his eyes. On the contrary, the Lord of the Nether was immediately overjoyed. After Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had arrived in the Netherworld, Zhou Weiqing had constantly controlled his emotions. Even though he was on the brink of death, he did not release any negative emotions. However, it was different now. As Tian’er charged towards the Destructive light, a massive amount of negative emotions rushed out of Zhou Weiqing’s will in a frenzy. The negative emotions greatly nourished the Destructive Energy within the Lord of the Nether’s body. The Lord of the Nether was very clear that once Tian’er died, Zhou Weiqing’s negative emotions would erupt. He had even had it all planned out - as long as Tian’er died, he would slow down his attacks, in order to allow Zhou Weiqing’s negative emotions to be released a little more, such that he was able to replenish his Destructive Energy. A Heavenly God powerhouse was able to fly at incredible speeds. In the instant when Zhou Weiqing cried out in his heart, Tian’er had already charged into the light, using her body to block it. Zhou Weiqing subconsciously shut his eyes. Two streams of tears flowed down from his eyes uncontrollably.
