{"id":52005,"no":831,"title":"Chapter 283 - The Evolved Ancient Tree of Life (1)","content":"While the Sidhe Queen was experiencing strange feelings, Zhou Weiqing was feeling extremely depressed instead. Because they had a telepathic connection, he did not dare to harbor any dirty or lewd thoughts, which was pure agony to a sleazy man like him, Certainly, apart from agony, he did feel rather complacent too. After all, the Sidhe Queen was sharing a life with him! His alliance with the Sidhe could be considered to be ironclad. Regardless of how close the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Sidhe were in the past, his Peerless Sect was going to replace them and foster even closer ties with the Sidhe. The two figures flew up into the sky. In the next moment, Zhou Weiqing took the initiative to grab the Sidhe Queen’s hand. A silver light flashed, and the both of them vanished into thin air. As they were now spiritually connected, Zhou Weiqing was able to clearly pinpoint the location of the sealed grounds using the Sidhe Queen’s judgment. There was nothing faster than Spatial Shuttle. Even though it consumed a large amount of Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing was impatient to see his loved ones, and couldn\u0027t care less about anything else. Furthermore, his cultivation base had increased once again, hence he was not too bothered about the amount of energy consumed. Their Spatial Shuttle this time was different from the previous time, when they were chasing the enemy down. Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel the substantial decrease in the consumption of his Saint Energy. The most remarkable thing was that, perhaps because he was holding the Sidhe Queen’s hand and that they were now sharing lives, the Sidhe Queen was helping him take on a portion of the Saint Energy consumption load. In other words, under such circumstances, they were able to travel longer distances via Spatial Shuttle - even a Heavenly God would not be able to achieve that! At this time, the Sidhe Queen seemed to have calmed down. As they were cruising in the other dimension, her state of mind did not undergo any changes and Zhou Weiqing on the other hand also tried his best to restrain his mind, in a bid to prevent any dirty thoughts from surfacing, as well as treating the Sidhe Queen purely as his platonic friend. A silver light flashed. When the two of them reappeared, they had already arrived in the sealed grounds. With the Sidhe Queen by his side, the seal of the sealed grounds did not have any effect on him. Even though they had just arrived in the sealed grounds, both Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen could clearly sense its changes. Originally, the sealed grounds was already full of vigor. However at this moment, they were shocked to find that the vitality in this place was so strong to the point where it was almost visible to the naked eye. Just by taking a couple of deep breaths, it allowed one to throb with vitality. The dense nature elements even caused a layer of faint green halo to form around the Sidhe Queen’s body. Since Zhou Weiqing was sharing a life with the Sidhe Queen, he could clearly feel the vitality in her body soaring rapidly at a terrifying speed. Even his own vitality soared accordingly. It was a wonderful feeling. The both of them were already considered to be ultimate powerhouses in this world - even a phenomenal increase in their vitality would not help their cultivation base much. However, it was greatly beneficial to their physical strength. Additionally, the Sidhe Queen was able to directly absorb the nature elements in this place. Zhou Weiqing was absolutely certain that in such a place, the Sidhe Queen was the most invincible figure in the entire Mainland. Unless Zhou Weiqing could advance to the Heavenly God Stage and was able to use his Saint Energy to mobilize these nature elements, he absolutely could not be compared to the Sidhe Queen. Hovering in mid-air, the Sidhe Queen\u0027s gaze was fixated on a single direction. She seemed to be completely in a daze - her delicate body was even trembling slightly. Since they had already returned to the sealed grounds, Zhou Weiqing wanted to let go of her hand so as to prevent any misunderstanding. However, the Sidhe Queen held his hand tightly instead, not allowing him to let it go. Her small hand was rather cold. However, via the spiritual connection, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense her current emotional fluctuations. After being in a daze for five full minutes, the Sidhe Queen gradually snapped out of it and her heart fluttered. “There\u0027s no need to.” Zhou Weiqing couldn\u0027t hold back and said it after sensing the Sidhe Queen\u0027s thoughts. The Sidhe Queen turned around and looked at him. She had a resolute gaze and her thoughts were firm. Immediately after, the Sidhe Queen’s body emitted a strong layer of green light; the dark green light was akin to a sheer shimmery jadeite. It was filled with endless life aura and green temptation. Following that layer of green light, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that the entire sealed grounds trembled slightly. Far away, similarly, a ray of dark green light shot up to the skies. This time, the Sidhe Queen was leading Zhou Weiqing. Amidst the rich Life Energy ripples, she took a big step into the void. Zhou Weiqing’s vision blurred; he felt the surrounding Life Energy fluctuate violently. Immediately after, the massive Life Energy transformed into a bridge, bringing their bodies to a different place. In the next moment, Zhou Weiqing was captivated by the marvelous scenery before them. It was an enormous tree that he had never seen before. Even the huge trees within the Luster Spatial Realm seemed like toddlers compared to it. The tree before his eyes was three hundred feet tall and its dark green trunk looked as though it was carved out of an emerald gem. But then again, such an enormous piece of emerald gem did not exist on earth. Its enormous canopy spread wide open in the sky, akin to a huge platform. At one glance, a green hazy light could clearly be seen hanging above it. That was the substantialized Life Energy! Only a tremendous vitality could bring about such a massive amount of Life Energy. The vast size of the canopy could be compared to the Zhongtian Plaza. Every leaf and every branch looked crystal-clear and transparent. The branches looked like waterfalls cascading in all directions; rich life aura made the entire scenery look like it was taken out of a dream. To Zhou Weiqing, such a spectacular scenery was extremely rare. The Sidhe Queen, who was holding onto Zhou Weiqing\u0027s hand, suddenly became entirely transparent; the light that she was releasing gradually transformed from dark green into a strange shade of gold. Even though it was still a golden light, it did not release energy ripples. Instead, it emitted an even more massive amount of vitality than the enormous tree itself. The Sidhe Queen stood before the enormous tree. Tears rolled down her cheeks as she mumbled, “It has evolved, it really has evolved. For several years, the Sidhe could only live within the sealed grounds; every single day we had to live in fear of the ancient tree of life wilting and dying. Weiqing, the evolution of the ancient tree of life signifies the possibility of the Sidhe ruling over the Mainland once again. Once the seal is broken, the massive vitality of the ancient tree of life is able to envelop at least a third of the Boundless Mainland. By then, the soldiers of the Sidhe will be the most invincible in the world. The evolution of the ancient tree of life will also triple our lifespan. It will take us a hundred years, at most, to regain our power to contend for hegemony over the Mainland, unifying the entire Mainland under our rule. Zhou Weiqing did not utter a single word, but he knew that the Sidhe Queen was not exaggerating. The vitality released by the ancient tree of life before his eyes was too terrifying, to the extent that it could no longer be measured. When the Sidhe Queen mentioned that its life aura could envelop a third of the Mainland, she was not exaggerating at all. In fact, it might have been an understatement. If the vitality of the ancient Sidhe tree engulfed the Mainland, it would mean that within the affected areas, the sidhe soldiers would possess extremely strong combat powers, making it hard to kill them. Coupled with the fact that the Sidhe Queen would be almost invincible under the effect of the massive vitality of the ancient tree of life, it was not impossible for them to regain their dominance over the Mainland. Furthermore, the Sidhe Queen was going to put aside a hundred years’ worth of time to accumulate it. Zhou Weiqing felt slight chills run down his spine. If what she said became a reality, in the near future, the Sidhe would most likely begin a massive bloodshed. After all, they had imprisoned themselves within the sealed grounds due to the rise of mankind! The Sidhe had absolutely no positive sentiments towards them. Zhou Weiqing himself was the one who triggered everything - if he did not save the Sidhe Queen by channeling Saint Energy into her body, the ancient tree of life would not have evolved. The Sidhe Queen turned to look at Zhou Weiqing. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing realized that he was unable to sense her emotions. Gently shaking her head, a soft smile appeared on her delicate face, “Did you know? After the ancient tree of life had evolved, it would truly become a sentient being. In a way, it is my body, and I am its heart. In other words, it no longer needs to stay rooted to the ground and is allowed to move freely, at any time.” Upon hearing what she said, Zhou Weiqing was unable to keep his cool. His eyes were filled with shock as he stared at the Sidhe Queen. He croaked, “Your Majesty, you must think twice!” Being able to move about freely meant that the ancient tree of life\u0027s massive vitality could engulf every inch and corner of the Mainland! The Sidhe’s current power was already sufficiently terrifying. Within the next few years, they would be able to nurture an army of powerhouses. By then, the Sidhe could very well be human beings’ greatest nightmare. At this very moment, a huge number of sidhe came flying over to them from all directions, as if they were acting as the backdrop of Sidhe Queen’s words. Not far from Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen, a group of sidhe had already gathered, except that right now, upon seeing a rich golden light that was emitted by the Sidhe Queen, they were afraid to approach them for fear of disrupting. Hence, they slowly knelt on the ground and bowed respectfully from afar.
