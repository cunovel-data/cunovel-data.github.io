(1)","content":"Chapter 255: Don’t Make Me Bathe The Xuantian Citadel In Blood!\n The Saint Energy didn’t start flowing that rapidly but even the slightest fluctuation had a great attraction towards the external atmospheric energy. He could feel his cultivation increasing bit by bit. During this process, the atmospheric energies were transforming into Saint Energy while continuing to compress into astral form.\n This process couldn’t be considered fast but the majority of Heavenly Jewel Masters in the nine continents would dream about something like this.\n Zhou Weiqing has been meditating for one day already. When he opened his eyes the second time, his spirit had been rejuvenated.\n The room had been cleaned up, with a new meal ready. Weiqing showed no reservation and quickly ate before leaving behind the payment. He didn’t say goodbye to the fishing girl. After leaving the room, he decided on a direction before leaping up and unleashed his Dragon-Tiger wings before heading towards the Xuantian Palace at maximum speed.\n How could he not be anxious when Shangguan Bing’er’s life was on the line? In his mind, the Spatial Teleportation Gem was nothing compared to her well being. Nothing was more important than her in his mind.\n Xuantian Citadel, seventh level.\n The upper echelons of the palace were seated. However, the atmosphere was quite somber at this moment.\n This time, Dongfang Hanyue sat in the master seat while her dazzlingly beautiful middle-aged mother, the previous ‘Palace Master’, was sitting where ‘Dreamwake’ used to.\n Dongfang Hanyue had just recently returned after receiving the news.\n After Weiqing became unconscious, she originally wanted to bring him back to the palace. However, the moment she returned to the Xuantian Continent, she heard the news from the palace.\n Her mother and the Grand Elders all returned. Of course, they first subdued and captured Shangguan Bing’er. This was the important reason why Weiqing couldn’t contact her.\n The palace also has an item similar to the long-range voice transmission gem. Hanyue’s mother, Dong Fang, used this item to confirm Hanyue’s safety as well as telling her that they had contained Bing’er.\n Hanyue was naturally worried and told her mother to release Bing’er. Alas, she was refused. She didn’t dare to bring Zhou Weiqing back and so she had to leave him behind in the fishing village and ran back herself to deal with this matter. Even though she didn’t know the extent of the relationship between those two, Bing’er was still Zhou Weiqing’s woman! If Bing’er was hurt in the palace, Weiqing would probably immediately turn against her. This wasn’t the development she wanted to see.\n As a result, Weiqing guess wasn’t quite correct. It couldn’t be, given the complexity of the situation.\n “Release Shangguan Bing’er right now!” Hanyue commanded without hesitation.\n The Water Elder slightly frowned, “Palace Master, you need to calm down first. We need to discuss this more.”\n Dongfang Hanyue furiously stated, “What else is there to talk about?! Not only is Zhou Weiqing a Consecrated of our palace while Bing’er is an Elder, the fact is that during our moment of greatest peril, Zhou Weiqing came and saved all of us. We shouldn’t be treating him like this.”\n The Water Elder sighed and said, “Yes, Zhou Weiqing did save us. But Palace Master, have you thought about it? Why did this Zhou Weiqing try to hide his power so much? Moreover, none of us were able to detect it. Why is that, and what was the technique used back then? Even a Heavenly God expert’s aura was suppressed by him. That technique might not be an offensive one, but it does reveal that he had the power to threaten us.”\n “How old is he? Only around twenty, yet he is already at the nine-Jeweled level and has a type of strange Heavenly Energy. You can’t tell me that there is nothing odd going on here. Moreover, he isn’t the same as you, having inherited a legacy. I’m afraid he had other plans in joining us. While it’s true that we are indebted to him, for the sake of the palace I really must ask you to think it through. We must carefully investigate this matter and wait until Zhou Weiqing returns before making a decision. Shangguan Bing’er is an important card we now hold. And, don’t worry. We are not mistreating her.”\n Hanyue’s expression became quite unsightly, fluctuating between red and white. She had to admit that the elders were right, since she knew what he had come for. However, if he actually returned, would the elders spare him? What should I do now? How do I deal with this?\n “Who gave the order to put Shangguan Bing’er under house arrest? You all dared to be so bold in my absence?” Dongfang Hanyue’s voice was quite awe-inspiring, and she had a murderous glint in her eyes. Her mind was slightly disordered at this moment since she still hadn’t decided how she should handle the issues between her and Weiqing. And now, something like this had happened at the palace?\n “It was me.” Dong Fang, who had been quiet the whole time, finally spoke with a serious tone.\n After hearing her mother’s voice, Dongfang Hanyue paused for a moment before saying, “Mother, how can you do this? Isn’t this forcing Zhou Weiqing to be our enemy?”\n Dong Fang frowned. “Hanyue, you are not thinking clearly because you are too deeply involved. It seems like Zhou Weiqing has actually won you over. If he remains our Consecrated, I won’t object to the relationship, but it now seems his background is unclear. How can we not investigate this? You are the Xuantian Palace Lord and can’t act so rashly. Carefully reconsider, our action is necessary due to the overall situation. Moreover, we are only keeping Shangguan Bing’er under house arrest. This is only something the people sitting here know about. There’s no way Zhou Weiqing can know. Once he comes back, as long as we have investigate everything clearly and can see that he really doesn’t bear any malice towards our sect, then everything will be fine.”\n Hanyue could be angry towards the elders but not towards her own mother. Despite being the Palace Master, she had only recently inherited this position. If her mother and the Grand Elders stood together, her influence would be far from enough to change these decisions.\n The Water Elder reminded: “Palace Master, no need to be angry. We old men all remember that Zhou Weiqing has saved our lives and we are not the type to show ingratitude to a friend. However, we must think of the palace before all else. We have lost six elders, a terrible loss. If we have internal problems as well, we would suffer a truly grievous blow. We spent quite a bit of time considering this issue before coming to this decision.”\n Dongfang Hanyue became quiet. The elders and her mother weren’t being unreasonable. If she could stay calm, she would naturally think that their action was correct. Zhou Weiqing was an outsider, after all. Alas, he had an unshakable position in her mind since she had already given him her most precious thing. Given this situation, she had already chosen to stand by his side.\n Rather than say they won this effort against the Terror Sea Dragon, it was more accurate to say that neither side won. Even though the more powerful dragon was killed, there was still another one alive. Moreover, the one dead chose to self-destruct so they didn’t get anything good from it, but instead they had lost six of their top Elders. It made sense that the four Grand Elders would tread so carefully.\n After taking a deep breath, Dongfang Hanyue managed to calm her emotions. She gritted her teeth as she made a decision. It was better to make a few things clear instead of letting them play the guessing game.\n “There is no need to investigate, I know his background,” Dongfang Hanyue sighed and said quietly.\n Dong Fang looked at her in astonishment, “You do? How?”\n Dongfang Hanyue smiled wryly and said, “Because after the self-destruct, we were blown away to the same place. We drifted to an abandoned island and met there. I had the same questions as everyone too and even wondered if he would attack me, because when we met I had been heavily wounded and had less than ten percent of my strength.”\n The group was shocked when they heard this. When they saw her return, she had been completely fine so they thought that she hadn’t suffered any injuries at all. Dong Fang and the elders had relied on their powerful cultivation and the Tenebrous Sealing Formation to protect themselves. Even though there were some injuries, they still came out relatively unscathed due to being Heavenly Emperors. After hearing her story, they suddenly remembered that Dongfang Hanyue had been at the core of the explosion, since she was the main offensive power against the dragon!\n Dong Fang hurriedly asked: “Did he do anything to you?”\n Hanyue sighed in response: “Mother, if he wanted to do anything, I wouldn’t be sitting here right now. Not only did he not hurt me, but he also used his marvelous Heavenly Energy to cure my wounds. He called this power, Saint Energy. He didn’t need long to treat my injuries, allowing me to recover to peak condition.”\n “I forced him to answer about his history. He didn’t hide anything. He told me everything without hiding.”\n Afterward, Hanyue carefully told everyone of Zhou Weiqing’s background. Everyone’s expressions changed after hearing that Zhou Weiqing was actually from the Boundless Mainland while not belonging to any of the Great Saint Lands.\n “... He came for the Spatial Teleportation Gem. Back when we were dealing with the Terror Sea Dragon, if he just stood to the side and wait for the right moment… given his cultivation, I imagine all of you know what his chances for success were. If it wasn’t for him, we would have been facing two dragons! But he didn’t take advantage of the situation and chose to help us instead, risking his life against the second dragon. I admit that I was moved by him at that moment. It was in that instance that I realized that I like him.”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-255-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
