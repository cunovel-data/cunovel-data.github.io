(3) “Father only has a single daughter… me… he won’t force me too much. As long as I threaten him with my death, I’m sure I can persevere. However, I’m afraid I will not be able to look for you in the near future.” “Please do not come looking for me… I beg you ok? I know you, and I know that with your character, it is very easy for you to charge into something without caring about the consequences. However, if you really do so… then you are letting down all my painstaking efforts in doing all this. You now have much more important things to do. At least… before you have sufficient power, do not come looking for me. I will try my best to convince my father.” “I’m going now, I do not have any regrets, only yearnings for you. Weiqing, you have not told me that you loved me forever yet… but I love you…” “Your Tian’er, your Fat Cat.” ……….. Yes! How could I give up so easily?? When I was at the lowest point of my life, when I first heard news of my Empire being invaded and destroyed… it was Tian’er who was beside me. It was she who comforted me, encouraged me, gave me the hope to live, the strength to start working towards everything I now have today. Tian’er gave me her most precious self in order to help me recover myself… As she said before herself, in her life, she will only belong to me! I haven’t even told her how much I love her yet... She is my Fat Cat, my Tian’er! Only mine! The memories of how Tian’er gave all of herself to him flooded back into his mind… the memories of the past few years, how he hugged Fat Cat to sleep... her warmth and comfort… Zhou Weiqing felt his spirit filled with an indescribable yet powerful strength. All of the pain seemed to be somehow suppressed by that powerful spiritual power, allowing his spirit core to be clear. His eyes, having turned bloodshot earlier, slowly turned back to their usual hue, recovering some of their lustre, yet turning deeper and more profound... forming a strange yet fresh contrast to his body, which had somehow subconsciously entered the Demonic Change State on its own accord. Currently, in those deep black orbs of Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, there was only firm resolution. No matter how much pain, how much torture and suffering that tore away at his very being… for Tian’er, I will definitely withstand everything. Definitely. Long Shiya stood at the side. He had personally witnessed everything happening in Zhou Weiqing’s body, and currently, this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was truly stunned to his core. In his life, Long Shiya seldom felt true respect for anyone. Although he might not speak it outright, in the entire world, there were only two people he truly respected. One was Duan Tianlang, a man who had spent his life fully on the Legacy of Strength, reaching the pinnacle of the Consolidating Equipment Master world. The other one was the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian. Of course, regarding this, Long Shiya would never admit it, but Xue AoTian was truly at the height of the world, the Heavenly God Tier power that even he could not reach. In his heart, he always had that spark of respect towards Xue AoTian. Countless of times he had challenged Xue AoTian, and countless of times he had failed, and that had also given him a unique relationship between him and Xue AoTian. However, at this point, Long Shiya realised that deep in his heart, there was now one more person that was worthy of respect. His precious disciple… Ordinarily, a teacher, a master, would not respect or admire his own disciple, but now, it was without doubt that deep within Long Shiya’s heart, such an emotion had arisen. The change that had overcame Zhou Weiqing just now was just too clear. As Long Shiya had been constantly infusing Heavenly Energy into Zhou Weiqing’s body, he could clearly sense the changes in his mind’s core, and he was also clear how close Zhou Weiqing had been to breakdown. Although Long Shiya was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, he was helpless to provide aid at that moment, and could only watch on worriedly. At that point, Long Shiya had been filled with regret, regret that he had actually agreed to bring Zhou Weiqing here to Awaken his Solidified Dragon Spirit in advance… Now, he could only watch this unbelievable young talent that was his one and only disciple, full of hope to overtake himself and breakthrough to the Heavenly God Tier in the future, breakdown and perish. One could imagine the sheer agony in Long Shiya’s heart. However… just as he thought Zhou Weiqing would breakdown, a miracle truly appeared. In that instant, the illusory image of the Dark Demon God Tiger above Zhou Weiqing’s head seemed to shimmer and fade slightly, becoming paler. Right beside the immense black tiger, another illusory image shimmered into existence, even paler, but clearly a huge white tiger. Towards that image of the white tiger, Long Shiya was just too familiar. Although it was shimmering and faded, barely a shadow, he could instantly see that it was Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger of the Heavenly Snow Mountain! Along with the appearance of the illusory white tiger, four balls of light stealthily appeared above Zhou Weiqing’s head. One fully black, representing the Darkness Attribute, one grey, representing the Demonic Attribute, one gold representing the Divine Attribute, and the last purple, representing the Spirit Attribute. The four different colours forming a strange whirlpool, spinning around as they entered Zhou Weiqing’s head from his BaiHui Acupuncture Point. Right at that instant, Zhou Weiqing’s entire spirit seemed to lift up, the feeling that he was about to breakdown at any point disappearing totally. As his spirit raised, his own body clearly showed a change. The first change was that the two bouts of Light and Darkness Heavenly Energy that Long Shiya had sent into Zhou Weiqing’s mind’s core to protect him was actually forcefully shoved back out. Next, the two energies duking it out in Zhou Weiqing’s body, the Solidified Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline powers actually paused momentarily in a temporary peace. Although it was just an instant, it was clear that their fight afterwards was no longer as violent, as if they were being restrained by a third party energy. What kind of powerful spiritual energy was required to do something like that! At this point, Zhou Weiqing had finally truly reached the actual cycle of Awakening the Solidified Dragon Spirit, and he had finally tided over the initial danger period. Now that the initial danger period was over, the next process was even more smooth sailing than Long Shiya had expected. Without question, for all of that to have happened, the most important thing was Zhou Weiqing’s devotion and obsession. If not for that powerful willpower, he would have broke down long ago. This was also the reason why Long Shiya felt such respect. He had to ask himself, perhaps if he was in Zhou Weiqing’s place, he did not have confidence of being able to do the same. The most curious thing to Long Shiya was why the Four Saint Attributes [1. I checked several sources and the paragraphs above is accurate. However, Darkness Attribute isn’t one of the Saint Attributes, it should have been the Time Attribute instead I believe (so let’s just take it as such)] would appear above Zhou Weiqing’s head at the same time, along with the bloodline powers. This was truly inconceivable. In truth, the reason why such a state of affairs had happen was indeed because of Tian’er… and it could be said that in such a critical period, Tian’er had saved Zhou Weiqing’s life. Originally, Tian’er was in her evolving stage when she met up with Zhou Weiqing, and it was because of Zhou Weiqing’s two Saint Attributes of Demonic and Time that she had started staying together with him. It was exactly the complete combination of the Four Saint Attributes that had such a huge draw to Tian’er. At that time, Zhou Weiqing’s personal cultivation level and strength was just too low that he had not sensed anything about this, and that attraction level was not as obvious to him. After that, the two of them had spent several years together. During that time, Tian’er’s cultivation level had grown by leaps and bounds. It could be said that by staying with Zhou Weiqing, both of them had the complete combination of the Four Saint Attributes circulating, greatly improving the speed of their cultivation… just that Zhou Weiqing did not know anything about it. When Tian’er had broken through to her seven-Jeweled cultivation level, the four Saint Attributes had circulated, bringing Zhou Weiqing to breakthrough to his next cultivation level as well. At that time, although Tian’er had indeed gained a large amount of benefit from Zhou Weiqing, her own energy had definitely influenced him greatly as well. On that fateful day, on the Heavenly Jewel Island, both of them had shared a precious night, and Tian’er had given her most precious first time to Zhou Weiqing. However, in that process, the Four Saint Attributes had also gone through a most thorough ‘mixing’. As such, from that time on, not only Tian’er, but Zhou Weiqing as well, both their bodies held some of each others’ energies. At this current moment, as Zhou Weiqing was facing death, the last stubborn obsessive thought in his mind was Tian’er. The two Saint Attributes that belonged to Tian’er that were left remaining in Zhou Weiqing’s body was actually activated and awakened. The power of the Solidified Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline was undoubtedly extremely strong, but when the four Saint Attributes came together, the sheer vast and boundless power, and more importantly, their state was at a level above all. As such, as the stubborn obsession in Zhou Weiqing’s heart and the Four Saint Attributes came up together, they successfully brought him through his most dangerous period, bringing him to the right path of Awakening his Solidified Dragon Spirit. Such a turn of events, no one could have expected all the various paths that had led to this… and as Zhou Weiqing realised he was on the route to success, even he felt it was inconceivable… let alone Long Shiya. Right in the center of Zhou Weiqing’s forehead, a tiny glow of light appeared. It was not too large or obvious, just the size of a mere broad bean, but its sheer lustre caused the surrounding magma to almost pale in comparison. If one were to examine closely, they would be able to see that the light was actually made four different colours mixed together… it was the representing colours of the Four Saint Attributes. They slowly moved down from Zhou Weiqing’s forehead, slowly entering his skin that was submerged in the magma. At that point, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that strange energy circulating around his body before stopping right at his chest area. All the pain was still there, but by now, he no longer had any thought of giving up. Furthermore, as the strange whirlpool had intervened, both the Solidified Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline energies started gathering at the center of the whirlpool, merging within. Strangely, at this current point, they were being released in the center of the whirlpool, but miraculously able to fuse together, stopping right at the center of Zhou Weiqing’s chest area. At the beginning, due to the whirlpool being extremely small, it was only able to draw in and merge a very tiny amount of both energies. However, as time passed, and more of both energies were drawn in and merged, the whirlpool grew larger and larger, and its glow seemed to dim a little. The reason why the whirlpool grew larger was because the fresh energies that was being merged in was also starting to move along as well. As such, although the speed of the spinning did not increase, the draw on the Solidified Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline energies continued increasing. This was also the reason why Zhou Weiqing’s pain was gradually weakening.
