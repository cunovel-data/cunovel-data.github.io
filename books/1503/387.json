(1)\n In the end, Shen Yi showed that she was indeed worthy of being a Battalion Commander after all. In such a critical situation, she did not forget to shout out loud: “First Heavy Cavalry Company, Bows!”\n The ZhongTian Empire Heavy Cavalry could be said to be the most well equipped army unit in the entire continent, able to fight at all ranges. Three hundred yards was not near by any stretch of the imagination, and for the Peerless Battalion soldiers to charge over would take them some time, and that was sufficient time for these well trained cavalry soldiers to recover from the numbness, keep their lances and draw bow and arrow. Their shields were bound to their left arm, and did not affect their archery.\n However, how could Zhou Weiqing possibly let them have such a chance? If his plan was only to fire those two arrows, he did not need to jump down from the hill. After all, what was three hundred yards to the Overlord Bow and someone of his strength and archery Skill?\n A deep, powerful howl emitted from Zhou Weiqing’s mouth, filled with a regal aura. At that moment, his eyes turned bloodshot, but strangely, his body did not change. It could be said that he was continuing to improve his control over the Demonic Change State, making use of its aura but not letting himself fully enter the Demonic Change State.\n As his cultivation level rose, Zhou Weiqing could currently even allow only part of his body to enter the Demonic Change. Of course, this was also because he had read the Heavenly Demon Sect’s Demonic Manual and trained hard in doing so. Towards his Demonic Attribute, it could be said that the Demonic Manual had given him massive help. Not only did it allow him to gain much better control over the usage of his Demonic Change State, he learnt more about the essence of the Demonic Attribute and how to use all its skills.\n This loud tiger’s roar of his seemed to reverberate out like a huge wave, exploding out towards them. Even the Ghost Demon Horses had not been able to withstand the angry howl of the Dark Demon God Tiger previously, let alone these fine warhorses, which though fine and stout, were not even Heavenly Beasts.\n All the heavy cavalry soldiers had barely just recovered from their numbed state, and had not even had the time to draw their bows yet. Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s roar, they felt a chill in their hearts as their blood ran cold, and more so, their warhorses below them buckled and fell like wheat being harvested from a field.\n Using the Dark Demon God Tiger aura’s to howl out loud had its limit, but to just cover a mere Company of soldiers, it was much more than enough.\n With a loud thud, Shen Yi’s horse also crumpled to the ground, and she subconsciously leaped aside in order to not get trapped by the fallen horse. When she looked towards Zhou Weiqing once more, her eyes met his bloodshot ones, and she couldn’t help but shiver uncontrollably, the ominous feeling she had raising to a maximum.\n The heavy cavalry soldiers definitely looked imposing and grand atop their warhorses, but when their horses were all on the ground, with a large number of the soldiers being trapped under the horses, it was a totally opposite descriptive phrase that would be required. The reason was simple - their equipment was just too heavy, not just the soldiers, but the horses too. When toppled to the ground, it was a sheer feat just to stand up once more… and that time was more than enough for the Peerless Battalion brigand soldiers to reach them.\n Zhou Weiqing’s angry roar had indeed given these brigand soldiers a huge scare as well, but the power behind it was after all not directed at them. Seeing the entire Company of heavy cavalry soldiers topple just like that, Zhou Weiqing’s image in their hearts grew yet another notch.\n The following sight could be described as ‘too horrible that one could hardly bear to look at it’. The brigand soldiers of the Peerless Battalion had long since been filled with pent up anger after being exiled to this dangerous wasteland for so long. Now that they had a chance to vent their anger, how could they be polite?\n If the two sides were to meet on the battleground in a direct clash, the heavy cavalry Company might not be afraid of them. Alas, now that they had lost their greatest advantage, and were all lying on the ground, with so many Physical Jewel Masters on the side of the Peerless Battalion could only spell their upcoming bitter fate.\n Even Zhou Weiqing could only stare with his jaw agape, only now did he know what it truly meant to dismember an ox as skillfully as a butcher [1. No part left untouched, no leaf unturned!]. These brigand soldiers were truly skilled in the art of robbery, with three to four each handling a single heavy cavalry soldier, swarming up swiftly, and in a matter of four to five breaths, the cavalry soldier would be left with just his underpants. Such speed, such swiftness, such skill. Of course, at the same time, that cavalry soldier would not be spared from a beating.\n “Peerless Battalion brothers, listen up, do not injure and especially do not kill any of them. That will be adverse to our profit. Without gain, how can we lay hands on our allies right?” Shen Yi, who had just barely recovered, almost stumbled and fell upon hearing that. What ‘how can we lay hands on our allies?’ Isn’t that already laying hands?! If you had more gain, would you kill us all off?\n “Zhou Little Fatty, I’ll kill you!” Sword in hand, Shen Yi charged towards Zhou Weiqing with all her might.\n These Peerless Battalion fellows were indeed sly. Seeing the four sets of Heavenly Jewels around Shen Yi’s wrists, when they charged forward, they all veered around this Battalion Commander, giving her a wide berth, very ‘generously’ leaving her for Zhou Weiqing.\n “Let me, let me… didn’t you say whatever we snatch belongs to us? This girl’s figure is close to mine.” In the army, the make of armour did not differentiate between male and figure, unlike custom made armours or Consolidated Equipment, where the owners would definitely have some changes depending on their gender.\n The one who spoke was naturally Shangguan Fei’er. In a flash, she had passed by Zhou Weiqing, facing Shen Yi whose eyes were bloodshot and berserk.\n Shen Yi threw the sword in her hands towards Shangguan Fei’er, and the next instant, another sword appeared in her hands, glowing brilliantly with flames, clearly her Consolidated Equipment. Jumping up in the air abruptly with a loud angry howl, she struck down towards Shangguan Fei’er’s head, the flames of her sword extending almost three metres.\n Zhou Weiqing did not even bother looking at them, knowing that leaving Shen Yi to Shangguan Fei’er would not be an issue at all, and he did not need to worry about them. At this point, he had already dismissed the Overlord Bow, instead swapping to the Black Dawn Bow, looking around before firing off arrows slowly and steadily towards any stronger heavy cavalry soldiers who put up a fight. Naturally, he would not kill anyone, but with just his archery alone, he could easily take care of the entire battlefield with only a hundred enemies. His only job here was to ensure that there were no casualties on either side.\n Facing Shen Yi’s all out attack, Shangguan Fei’er gave a disdainful humph, leaping up to meet her flames directly. Just as it seemed like she was about to be struck down by the flames, Shen Yi felt a blur before her eyes, and Shangguan Fei’er disappeared, only to appear behind her back. Towards a lady, Shangguan Fei’er was much more gentler than towards Zhou Weiqing, and she struck down with her palm on Shen Yi’s neck, knocking her unconscious swiftly and painlessly, before carrying her down to land safely on the ground.\n In terms of power, it could be said that no one in the entire Peerless Battalion to compare with Shangguan Fei’er, perhaps not even Zhou Weiqing. However, in terms of robbing and snatching, Shangguan Fei’er paled far in comparison. By the time she slowly took off Shen Yi’s Battalion Commander armour, the entire fight was over.\n Zhou Weiqing stood right there, shouting out loud: “Gather them all together. If any of them dares to resist, beat them up until they stop resisting, just make sure no one dies.”\n As he said that, he couldn’t help but marvel at these brigand soldiers of his… in terms of stealing and robbing, they were truly ‘geniuses’ in that art.\n In just that short period of time, an entire Heavy Cavalry Company’s worth of equipment was in their hands. Besides the strongest Wei Feng, and the other Company Leaders, who managed to get an entire set of equipment, the rest were either wearing some pieces of armour, a single helmet, leading a horse, or even just the army uniforms. Such a mishmash of equipment, no matter how one looked at it, they looked just like a band of brigands.\n The hundred heavy cavalry soldiers dressed only in their underpants and gathered together, battered and bruised. With the bitter cold of the weather up north, and their equipment all lost, how could they dare to continue resisting? As for their Company Leader, Wei Feng had taken care of him personally, knocking him out swiftly in their clash.\n Now dressed in a full suit of armour, Wei Feng strode in large steps to the front of Zhou Weiqing, smiling happily as he said: “Battalion Commander, Reporting. One hundred heavy cavalry soldiers, none escape, no casualties. For our side, only a few of our brothers sustained minor injuries. Further instructions?”\n After that fight, Wei Feng was finally truly convinced about Zhou Weiqing. If not for him, they would definitely not be able to take down the heavy cavalry Company so easily, especially without any losses. Thinking back to what Zhou Weiqing had said about himself being omnipotent, he suddenly thought that perhaps that was not too huge of an exaggeration. Not only was this new Battalion Commander very similar to them, his abilities were truly inspiring.\n Zhou Weiqing nodded towards Wei Feng and said: “Very good, you all have done well. These spoils are all rewards for everyone. Today, this fight is totally conforming to our rules. Our overall power was far greater than our opponents, and more importantly, we did not have any injuries or death. You all must remember, the most important thing is always to protect ourselves, only then can we earn more in the future. If anyone dares to do anything stupid and look for death, I will personally whip him hard.”\n Walking beside Zhou Weiqing was not just Wei Feng, but all the other Company Leaders as well. Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, they all burst out laughing heartily.\n Black Bear sidled closer to Zhou Weiqing and said in a low voice: “Battalion Commander, that young lady sure is beautiful… shall we… heh heh… if you eat meat, at least let us brothers drink some soup. It’s been a long time…”\n Zhou Weiqing glared at him exasperatedly, saying: “You stupid bear, if you want to die, go do so alone and don’t implicate us all. That lady is the sister of the Sixteenth Regiment Commander Shen Bu. Robbing them is one thing, after all they left their camp secretly, and we are just defending ourselves. However, if you dare touch her, I can bet with you that within three days, the entire Sixteenth Regiment will be here to kill us all. Being a brigand also has an art to it… you can only do what is within your means, your power. Err… that… Fei… don’t take off her clothes…”\n He was still in the midst of scolding Black Bear when he suddenly saw Shangguan Fei’er had finished stripping Shen Yi of her armour, and was starting to unbutton Shen Yi’s clothes.\n Black Bear laughed and said: “Heh heh, this little brother is even more impatient and urgent than I am!”\n Shangguan Fei’er held onto Shen Yi’s armour as she stood up, turning to Zhou Weiqing and said: “I’m only taking off her outer clothes, I don’t have any army uniform to change to.” She did not lack clothing to change in her Spatial Ring, but they were all female clothes. How could she possibly wear them in the camp?\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-16-chapter-127-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
