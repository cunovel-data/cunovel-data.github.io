{"id":51992,"no":818,"title":"Chapter 278: The Sword of the Demon God (2)","content":"The Sidhe Queen furrowed her brows hard, “What is going on, and what is the reason you came to the sealed grounds?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing did not hide anything from her; he told her everything at once - why he came to the sidhe’s sealed grounds, as well as what happened after they got there.\\n\\n After she heard his explanation, the Sidhe Queen came to a sudden realization: “No wonder all of you could enter the sealed grounds – it is because of the presence of Saint Energy. Nature Energy was unable to stop you. Young man, you are one of the most outstanding human beings I’ve ever met. Even though you are very young, you have an impressive cultivation base; you could even summon the Demon God’s projection. From the looks of it, in the near future you will be able to surpass Phelia’s husband.”\\n\\n The Sidhe Queen’s facial expression remained the same, but when the twelve sidhe elders heard that he wanted to get the Sidhe Queen’s blood, they clearly looked rather unhappy.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said helplessly, “You flatter me. Ugh, I did not expect any of these things to happen during our trip here. Your Majesty, even though we do not know what exactly happened, I am willing to help you look for your daughter. Everything happened too fast at that time and as a result, I was unable to stop the perpetrator. I do not have a clue as to how he did it, but I still managed to leave a trace of my will on your precious daughter. It should help us locate her.”\\n\\n If those words were said by other people, the Sidhe Queen would definitely not believe them. Leaving traces of one’s will on others was a very difficult thing to do. Even for a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse like herself, she could not confidently say for sure that she could do it. However, it was different for Zhou Weiqing - he possessed Saint Energy. Furthermore, she had experienced the power of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy earlier. Without the existence of Saint Energy, how could he, a Heavenly Emperor, be able to contend against a Heavenly God like herself?\\n\\n Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue Aotian was not the only Heavenly God in this world. To put it simply, there were a few other powerful Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Beasts who were currently living in seclusion, like the Sidhe Queen herself.\\n\\n Looking at the sincere look on Zhou Weiqing’s face, the Sidhe Queen nodded, “That would be very great. I was in the midst of cultivating earlier, when all of a sudden I sensed external energy ripples appearing within the sealed grounds. Seconds later, my daughter’s aura disappeared. If I’m not wrong, she’s no longer within the sealed grounds at this moment. I’ll have to trouble you to help out.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled. “Your Majesty, please do not worry. The reason why I am willing to help you is not because I want to get your blood in return, but rather, I sincerely hope that we can be friends with the sidhe. With regards to my purpose of coming here, if it is possible, after we rescue your precious daughter, we can discuss it further - I’ll see if there is something we have that you want, so we can make an exchange. I’m sure you know the importance of a full eleven-piece Legendary Set to human beings.”\\n\\n The elders behind the Sidhe Queen looked extremely unhappy. They could tell that Zhou Weiqing would not give up on his objective that easily. However, at this moment, they were unable to interrupt their conversation. Even though they were not fond of these human beings, the matter at hand concerned the successor of the Sidhe Tribe. Zhou Weiqing claimed that he had left a trace of his will on the little Princess, and they did not doubt his words; Zhou Weiqing had such a high cultivation base, there was no way he would make up a story like this. Hence, they had no other choice but to hold their anger in.\\n\\n The Sidhe Queen looked at Zhou Weiqing and nodded her head slightly; a strange look flashed across her eyes. At this moment, nobody knew what she was thinking. Apart from the strange look in her eyes, everyone could tell that she was deeply troubled by the abduction of her daughter.\\n\\n After Zhou Weiqing finished his speech, he immediately sat cross-legged on the ground, closing his eyes, activating his Saint Energy and entering into a meditative state.\\n\\n Even though the sidhe’s hostility had already vanished, Zhou Weiqing’s women still instinctively surrounded him. Their cultivation base was not low, and they possessed Saint Energy as well. If the sidhe were to launch an attack, they were able to put up a fight against them.\\n\\n The reddish golden Nebula Saint Energy circled within Zhou Weiqing’s body, slowly rising as he carefully injected it into his soul.\\n\\n After all, the soul is a type of unique energy that resided near a human’s brain - it was a part of life. If an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master were to do what Zhou Weiqing did, it would be no different from committing suicide. The human brain is very vulnerable - any minor injury could result in death.\\n\\n However, Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy was different - even if he sent a massive amount of Saint Energy to his brain, the Saint Energy would create a protective barrier on its own and not harm him at all. Saint Energy was a Creation Energy - it was not destructive in nature.\\n\\n A layer of golden light gradually emitted from Zhou Weiqing’s head. On his forehead, a strange mark symbolizing the character ‘King’ could clearly be seen. What was even more mysterious was that, below the mark, there was an indistinct dragon-shaped pattern. A powerful spiritual ripple erupted almost immediately.\\n\\n When Zhou Weiqing’s will was released, everyone was shocked, be it the Sidhe Queen or the elders of the sidhe. The fluctuations from his will were too intense and powerful. Even though they were within the sidhe’s sealed grounds, the intensity of the will shocked them to the extreme. The Sidhe Queen was positive that she herself was definitely incapable of releasing a will that powerful.\\n\\n Even though the will was powerful and strong, it could neither enhance one’s attack power nor attack directly. However, it meant that the user could have a greater level control and his scouting ability would be a lot stronger than others. To put it simply, if the distance that could be covered by other same level Heavenly Emperor powerhouses was 1 on the scale, then with the help of his Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing’s distance covered would be 10. This was also the reason why he could find the entrance of the sealed grounds in the first place.\\n\\n The Sidhe Queen hid her own will so as to not interfere with Zhou Weiqing’s scouting process. However, she could sense that it was heading in a single direction, as though it was being attracted by something.\\n\\n Indeed, he left a trace of his will on my daughter. This scouting method had validated Zhou Weiqing’s words.\\n\\n Not long later, Zhou Weiqing stood up abruptly and nodded his head at the Sidhe Queen, “Your Majesty, shall we make a trip there?”\\n\\n The face of the group of elders behind her changed and the leading elder hurriedly said, “Your Majesty, I don’t think you should go. What if……” \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing was quick-witted, he naturally knew what they were worried about. He said calmly, “There is no ‘what if’. I will leave my wives here - Her Majesty and I will travel by ourselves to rescue the princess.”\\n\\n The Sidhe Queen nodded, expressing that the elders should keep calm. She proceeded to hold her hand out, “Thank you for your trouble.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled - he had many thoughts racing through his head. He had already experienced the power of the sidhe; furthermore, without a doubt, there definitely had to be several mystical places within the sealed grounds. Also, he had just established the Peerless Sect. He had to create an alliance with the sidhe race. This was the perfect opportunity to bring them closer. Naturally, he would not let it go.\\n\\n A reddish golden light flashed across Zhou Weiqing’s eyes. He looked at the Sidhe Queen and nodded, “Sorry if this seems presumptuous.” Under everyone’s dumbfounded glares, Zhou Weiqing actually reached out to grab the Sidhe Queen’s petite hand and immediately after, a silver light flashed, and the space surrounding the two of them collapsed. A light flashed once more, and they both disappeared into thin air. They were shuttling through space.\\n\\n The group of elders continued to be dumbfounded; Zhou Weiqing’s wives did not look that happy either. Shangguan Fei’er snapped, “That bastard Little Fatty actually wants to take advantage of the Sidhe Queen.”\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er glared at her and said, “Don’t spout nonsense. Zhou Weiqing only did that to protect Her Majesty. Do you think Spatial Shuttle is that easy?”\\n\\n Tian’er added, “Even so, we have to be careful. Who knows if he has any ulterior motives? He has always been a fan of ‘universal love’.”\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er did not utter a single word, but she couldn’t help but laugh out loud.\\n\\n Little Witch sniggered, “What a ‘moral’ man! Indeed, you can’t trust his integrity.”\\n\\n Just as Shangguan Xue’er said, Zhou Weiqing held the Sidhe Queen’s hand to protect her while shuttling through space . Otherwise, once they entered the other dimension, if she were to get lost it would be hard to get out. It was a rather huge threat to a Heavenly God powerhouse.\\n\\n The Sidhe Queen’s petite hand was rather icy, but it was soft and tender, rather comfortable to hold.\\n\\n When Zhou Weiqing held the Sidhe Queen’s hand, he could clearly feel that the Sidhe Queen’s trembled a little, but she did not struggle. Clearly, she understood his intentions.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing did not have any dirty thoughts such as taking advantage of the Sidhe Queen in her own land. He would certainly not attempt anything that stupid. Additionally, now that he had five wives, he had been a lot meeker. After all, to a man, taking responsibility for his actions is a must. He already had far too many responsibilities; he could not afford to take on more. Additionally, the Sidhe Queen was a Heavenly God - Zhou Weiqing did not want to get himself into trouble. Besides, he did not think that he was charming enough to succeed!\\n\\n On the other hand, the Sidhe Queen experienced a different kind of feeling - having her hand held by Zhou Weiqing, she felt rather shy. Yet at the same time, a sense of novelty hit her. She was the most supreme figure of the sidhe race and had spent most of her time within the sealed grounds. The sidhe procreated in a different way from human beings - they did not have to mate. She conceived her daughter using her own blood via a special technique. No male sidhe had ever touched her before, let alone a man. She was not only the supreme being of the sidhe, she also represented purity. Only the purest beings could be allies with Mother Nature.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-278-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
