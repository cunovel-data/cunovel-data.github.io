Previously, we would thought that no matter how talented or outstanding he was, he would at most be able to create a Pseudo-God Tier Consolidating Scroll. Even so, his future prospects would definitely be superior to ours, given how young he is.”\n Shangguan Bing’er laughed coolly. “Aren’t you young as well?”\n The woman blinked, then slowly shook her head. A strange look flickered through her eyes. “No. I’m different from him. Anyway, Pseudo-God Tier Consolidating Scrolls will only appear when used to create the first few pieces of a legendary set, and even Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Masters stand a chance at creating them. This is because each piece of a legendary set is more powerful than the last. If the very first piece of a legendary set is a true God Tier Consolidating Scroll, then the total number of pieces in the set will have to be dramatically lessened. Thus, the first three or four pieces of most legendary sets are usually formed from Pseudo- God Tier Consolidating Scrolls.”\n Shangguan Bing’er now understood. “So that’s how it works.”\n The woman picked up Zhou Weiqing’s completed scroll. “I can tell that this should be part of a legendary set, but it definitely isn’t just a Pseudo-God Tier Consolidating Scroll. It has to be either the sixth or seventh piece of a legendary set. Considering the fact that he is at the five-Jeweled level, the sixth piece seems more likely.”\n If Zhou Weiqing was conscious, he would definitely let out a sigh of admiration for the accuracy of her guesses and her judgment. Although she wasn’t correct on all the underlying facts, she had actually managed to come to the correct conclusion thanks to her keen judgment. This scroll was in fact the sixth piece of his own ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Legendary Set, which could only help further confirm the fact that Zhou Weiqing had a five-Jeweled cultivation base.\n The way in which both the woman and the old man viewed Zhou Weiqing had completely changed. Shangguan Bing’er could now see a degree of esteem in their gazes, the esteem owed to an expert.\n “Please take him over to the room next door to recuperate. We can speak after he wakes up.” The woman walked over to Shangguan Bing’er while speaking, handing the scroll for the sixth piece of the Hate Ground No Handle set to her.\n Shangguan Bing’er stared at her, rather astonished. “Don’t you want it? You provided the materials, after all.”\n The woman smiled slightly, and the majesty of her smile caused even Shangguan Bing’er to feel momentarily inferior. Shangguan Bing’er was just as physically attractive as this woman, but she lacked the woman’s self-confidence. The woman’s aura emanated a type of absolute self-confidence. Even after encountering a genius like Zhou Weiqing, her confidence in herself hadn’t been lessened in the slightest.\n “Our XuanTian Palace isn’t that stingy. These materials are nothing more than a first meeting gift to Master Zhou.”\n Shangguan Bing’er naturally wouldn’t refuse, and so she immediately took the scroll and nodded at the woman. Suddenly, she felt as though the way in which the woman was staring at Zhou Weiqing seemed a bit peculiar.\n “After he wakes up, please tell him that my name is Dreamwake. They all call me Master Dreamwake. This person is Master Nie Han.” After speaking, she turned and exited the wooden room. As for the old man named Nie Han, he followed her and departed as well.\n “Dreamwake?” Shangguan Bing’er repeated this name a few times. Clearly, this young female God Tier Consolidated Equipment Master was using a pseudonym.\n The nearby wooden room was laid out just as simply as the last one. It had a table, two chairs, and a slender wooden bed. However, if you took a closer look you would discover that all of these things were actually constructed out of yellow rosewood. The entire room was filled with the faint, delicate floral scent of yellow rosewood and sandalwood.\n Shangguan Bing’er carefully laid Zhou Weiqing onto the bed, but before she even had a chance to sit down, a large and strong arm snaked around her waist, pulling her down into a warm embrace.\n “You woke up?” Shangguan Bing’er said, surprised and delighted.\n Zhou Weiqing didn’t open his eyes, but he tightly pressed Shangguan Bing’er’s soft body against himself. He sent via voice transference, “I would never dare to slumber for too long in a place like this. What’s the situation?”\n Shangguan Bing’er sent back, “You already passed their test. They gave us the scroll as well.”\n Zhou Weiqing said, “Excellent. I’ll rest for a bit longer then.” He had forced himself to wake up by suppressing the aching pain in his head, precisely because he was afraid that there might have been trouble. Now that he knew that they were safe for now, he finally relaxed and allowed himself go back to sleep.\n He had used up an absolutely enormous amount of mental energy. However, this process had been tremendously beneficial to him. Even though he was now asleep, his lips were still curved into a smile. The Saint Energy bottleneck which had bedeviled him for so long had finally been broken through in the instant that he had completed the God Tier Consolidating Scroll.\n Zhou Weiqing had been in complete control of himself, ensuring that none of the other three in the room had noticed a thing. In truth, however, his internals had undergone an absolutely astounding transformation.\n The thick silver Saint Energy had previously been swirling rapidly around his thirty-six Death Acupuncture Points, but not it actually began a new filtering and purifying process which further refined his entire body.\n This wasn’t a process which Zhou Weiqing himself had to maintain, as it was all carried out naturally by the Saint Energy. Breaking through the bottleneck had allowed him to reach a completely new stage. After he finally allowed himself to truly fall asleep following his conversation with Shangguan Bing’er, he could sense that a completely new Saint Energy had appeared within Dantian.\n After this breakthrough, his Saint Energy had transformed to become a completely pure silver color. It had transformed, much like how when he had completed the God Tier Consolidating Scroll the scroll had instantly turned silver.\n This pure silver light was filled with sparkling flashes of silver star-light. This pure silver had completely replaced the original silvery-white color. However, it did not become tougher to control due to the higher degree of compression, instead it actually became even gentler. As it flowed through his Dantian, it generated a faint, comfortable warm feeling.\n The transformation process was still ongoing. At a time like this, staying asleep was clearly the best choice for Zhou Weiqing, as the self-protective powers of Saint Energy ensured that he didn’t need to worry about any problems appearing within his body.\n The Saint Energy was continuously flowing through Zhou Weiqing’s body, transforming it. This new, highly purified liquid silver Saint Energy first appeared within Zhou Weiqing’s Dantian and head. Shangguan Bing’er was in Zhou Weiqing’s arms. Although she wasn’t able to sense the transformations occurring within his body, her own Saint Energy was affected and began to circulate on its own.\n This wasn’t the first time Shangguan Bing’er had experienced this happening to her Saint Energy, but in the past the process had been incredibly slow. She herself didn’t have any of the Saint Attributes after all, and so she lacked the ‘key’ needed to truly guide and control the Saint Energy in her body. However, since she was currently in Zhou Weiqing’s arms, the higher-level Saint Energy in his body began to ‘guide’ hers. The speed at which her Saint Energy was condensing and purifying made her feel as though she was racing a thousand kilometers each day.\n So it was possible to train while sleeping? Shangguan Bing’er wanted to laugh. Alas, she herself didn’t dare to fall asleep. They were in a different land, after all. More than that – they were in the headquarters of the XuanTian Palace. How could she lower her guard while Zhou Weiqing was asleep?\n Zhou Weiqing actually remained asleep for three full days. During this period of time, servants came to offer them delicacies, fruits, and beverages. Shangguan Bing’er didn’t need to do much for Zhou Weiqing; all she had to do was to stand guard by his side.\n Master Dreamwake and Master Nie Han came twice. They weren’t surprised by Zhou Weiqing’s deep slumber, as even they themselves would be exhausted and weakened for a period of time after successfully creating a God Tier Consolidating Scroll. This should be doubly true for Zhou Weiqing, given the absolutely unearthly techniques he used to accomplish it.\n They seemed to have fully accepted and approved of Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er. Both times they came, they demonstrated great friendliness. Indeed! A five-Jeweled cultivator had successfully become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. When he reached the Heavenly King stage, he would then be able to create God Tier Consolidating Scrolls with ease, right? How could XuanTian Palace not take him seriously?\n It wasn’t until the third day that Shangguan Bing’er, who kept her body pressed tightly against Zhou Weiqing’s, suddenly sensed her own transforming Saint Energy (which was being guided by his) suddenly accelerate dramatically before coming to a halt. A strange energy ripple stealthily emanated out of Zhou Weiqing’s body, one which only someone who also possessed Saint Energy like herself could possibly sense. In that brief instant, a strange insight suddenly appeared within her mind.\n Zhou Weiqing slowly opened his eyes, only to discover that everything around him seemed to become more clear and distinct. He could now see even the finest of grains on the wood ceiling above him with ease.\n His long slumber had been dictated by the Saint Energy in his body. After three days, his Saint Energy had finally completed its breakthrough from the thirty-sixth stage to the thirty-seventh stage.\n Ever since he had entered the nine-Jeweled stage, everything seemed to have changed for him. Even though he had simply risen by one cultivation stage, once again Zhou Weiqing saw a brand new world in front of him. The Saint Energy in his body hadn’t been completely transformed, but to him this was already an enormous surprise.\n All thirty-six of his Death Acupuncture Points had gained a mass of silver Saint Energy that glowed like the light of the stars. It was like they were ‘cores’ located inside the acupoints. As for the rest of the Saint Energy, it swirled outside these Saint Energy ‘cores’ and became increasingly dense. Both the transformed pure silver Saint Energy and the previous silvery-white Saint Energy had all become a dense liquid which now flowed twice as fast as before. All it took was one thought to activate the Saint Energy inside.\n What was even more marvelous was the fact that Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that his mental energy had expanded dramatically. And, thanks to the Saint Energy in his body, he was also able to clearly sense all ripples in atmospheric energy and Heavenly Energy for thousands of meters around him.\n This mountain gorge seemed to have been naturally formed into the shape of an atmospheric energy point. It would naturally generate a strong devouring force which was applied to the outside world. So long as any anything happened to the atmospheric energies within the gorge, the entire gorge would began to rapidly draw upon the atmospheric energies of the world outside.\n When Zhou Weiqing started to sense all of these things, he felt as though he had essentially become part of those atmospheric energies… and that any atmospheric energy he detected could be controlled by him. The Saint Energy in his body didn’t even need him to activate it; they naturally began to flow and train on their own. This training process seemed to expand the starry silver ‘rivers’ inside of his thirty-six Death Acupuncture Points.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-242-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
