He took a deep breath, his whole body feeling refreshed and energised, and his maximum Heavenly Energy seemed to have increased. This was his first time that he had replaced actual sleep with cultivation, and although it was not as comfortable as sleeping, but that energetic feeling he had now actually felt better than after a night of sleep. As he shoved open the door, the fresh air from the rushed in, causing him to breathe in deeply, and in a huge breath expelled all the foul air from his body gathered through the night of cultivation, and he felt a refreshing feeling course through his body. All of a sudden, he recalled the words that his first master had told him two years ago when they were parting: “You are now just a little rascal, but you are still far off from the true mastery of being a rogue. The highest state of a rogue is that even when you are being a rogue, others will think of you as a gentleman. When you are facing another rogue, you must be more roguish than him, but when facing a gentleman, you can be more suave and gentlemanly. Only then can you reach the ultimate stage and be a true Rogue, a genuine scoundrel.” At that point, Zhou Weiqing had just turned 12, and did not really understand those words. However, without knowing the reason, when he ended cultivation and shoved the gate open this morning, a sudden inexplicable feeling overcame, as if he had gained enlightenment on those words. As enlightenment dawned upon him, Zhou Weiqing said to himself with sudden understanding: “Yes! I’m no longer the trash of before, I do not need those low level rascally methods to conceal myself anymore. I am a great Heavenly Jewel Master. What is a Heavenly Jewel Master? Isn’t that a great person who can be a True Rascal?” At this moment, it was as if he had truly grown up and matured, his mental age growing even further from his actual age of 13. In the short amount of time that he was muttering to himself, the door to the side opened, and Shangguan Bing’er walked out from next door, both hands held up as she stretched, under the shining light of the sun, her beautiful figure was revealed to Zhou Weiqing in all her glory. “So beautiful.” Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but sigh in praise. Shangguan Bing’er turned her head around and gave him a cold glare, but Zhou Weiqing just gave her a faint smile and said: “Battalion Commander, let’s go eat now.” After saying that, he turned and walked out of the room towards the dining hall. Shangguan Bing’er actually paused in surprise, at that moment, she almost thought she had recognized the wrong person, Zhou Weiqing’s bright smiling face had been shining with sincerity, was that really the rascally Little Fatty Zhou? During their whole meal, Zhou Weiqing did not speak to Shangguan Bing’er at all, and after quickly wolfing down his breakfast, he went to Huyan Aobo and told him that he and Shangguan Bing’er were heading out for a while. When they left the courtyard, they headed to the Skill-Storing Palace which was just opposite. Before long, they had entered the Skill-Storing Palace, and at that point Shangguan Bing’er finally could not bear it and asked Zhou Weiqing, who was about three steps away from her: “Little Fatty Zhou, are you alright?” Zhou Weiqing asked curiously: “Yes I’m very good, what issue could I have?” Naturally, Shangguan Bing’er could not ask him: How come you aren’t trash talking to me? With a rather curious frame of mind, they entered the Skill-Storing Palace once more. The Heavenly Jewel Master badge and Robe that they had just received yesterday was the best pass, and they smoothly entered the Skill-Storing Palace’s main hall. “Battalion Commander, how do I start on Skill Storing later?” Zhou Weiqing asked Shangguan Bing’er. Shangguan Bing’er said: “The rules of the Skill-Storing Palace are very simple, besides the registration that we went through yesterday, the other nine entrances lead to their respective Heavenly Beast enclosures. According to the order they are separated in, which is – Water, Fire, Earth, Wind, Light, Darkness, Spatial and Life these eight attributes. The last entrance leads to the enclosure to those Heavenly Beasts with some special or unique attributes and abilities.” “Within each attribute’s enclosure, the Heavenly Beasts are divided into three stages just like us Jewel Masters, the Shi Stage, Zun Stage and Zong Stage respectively. Entering the Shi Stage region to carry out Skill Storing costs 500 gold coins per try, Zun Stage is 2000 gold coins, and the Zong Stage is 10,000 gold coins.” Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Are there any dangers during Skill-Storing?” Shangguan Bing’er said: “There shouldn’t be any danger. Do you know why amongst the eight attributes, four of them are called the Greater Attributes?” Zhou Weiqing shook his head, at a loss. Shangguan Bing’er said: “That is because those four Greater Attributes each have their own additional special capabilities. For example, you already know that the Spatial Attribute allows you to become a Consolidating Equipment Master. However, for the other three Greater Attributes, the Light and Darkness Attributes’ special characteristics lie in sealing, while the Life attribute’s special capability is resurrection. Hence, these four attributes are called the four Greater Attributes.” “Sealing? Resurrection?” Shangguan Bing’er said: “The Heavenly Beasts that the Skill-Storing Palace are rearing in the enclosures now have actually been Sealed by either Light or Darkness Attribute Jewel Masters with strong capabilities. As such, when Jewel Masters carry out Skill-Storing, it is not so dangerous. As for the Life Attribute’s Resurrection Ability, it is even more difficult to get than the Consolidating Equipment Scroll, furthermore the Resurrection Ability also has a success rate.” Zhou Weiqing said: “Since they are sealed, does that mean I can choose a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast to carry out Skill-Storing? What exactly is the difference in storing a skill from a higher ranked Heavenly Beast?” Shangguan Bing’er said: “Generally speaking, you will carry out Skill-Storing on a Heavenly Beast of the same rank. If you try to carry out Skill-Storing on a Zun Stage Heavenly Beast, the probability of success will be 1% of the success rate on a Shi Level Heavenly Beast, the total probability is extremely low, less than 1 in 10000. Similarly, if it is Zong Stage Heavenly Beast, it will be yet another 1% of that.” “Actually, no matter what rank of Heavenly Beasts you carry out Skill-Storing from, the skill we get on our Elemental Jewel is at the lowest level, but the skills will improve automatically as our Elemental Jewels increase. However, the rarer skills are only available from the higher ranked Heavenly Beasts. For example, the resurrection skill that Life Attribute Elemental Jewel Masters want the most, can only be found from at least a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast.” Zhou Weiqing said suddenly: “I understand. Battalion Commander, do you want to go in together?” Shangguan Bing’er shook her head, “I do not plan to carry out Skill-Storing yet, we do not have sufficient funds. You should just try the method that you mentioned yesterday. The rules here are very simple, as long as you enter the enclosures, you must make a payment. When you enter, you can only stay for not longer than four hours, since everyone can only carry out Skill-Storing once a day. The next day if you want to go in again, you’ll have to make a payment again.” Zhou Weiqing paused for a moment before saying: “Battalion Commander, lend me 10,000 gold coins first, I will definitely return it to you in future.” Shangguan Bing’er said in surprise: “You want to ……” Zhou Weiqing grinned: “I will just consider it as an experience to see a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast for now, which will be good for me as well. I will return the money to you in the future.” Shangguan Bing’er went silent for a moment, before fishing out a red card from her bosom and passed it to Zhou Weiqing. “This contains 50,000 gold coins. You go and try. Regardless of success or failure, this card will be sufficient for you to try five times, in the future you can just return me 50,000 gold coins directly. Do you need me me to wait for you?” “No, it is okay. Battalion Commander, you should just go back to continue with your Consolidating Equipment.” Zhou Weiqing knew that that was a Gold Coins Storage Card, and the red card denoted an upper limit of 50,000 gold coins. He did not say anything further, and after receiving the card he walked towards the entrance which led to the wind attribute enclosure.
