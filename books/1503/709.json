Even if it was two Heavenly God Tier powerhouses in the cabin, Zhou Weiqing could only brace himself and enter.\n Exchanging glances with Shangguan Bing’er, he held her hand as he pushed open the door and entered.\n The wooden door was very light, and just a slight push was enough to open it. The illumination within was very good, as sunlight streamed in through the windows on all four walls, along with the fragrance of flowers.\n As soon as he entered through the door, the first thing Zhou Weiqing saw was a broad desk. The entire desk was large, almost ten metres long, and it pretty much extended from one end of the cabin to the other. With a single glance, Zhou Weiqing could instantly tell that it was actually crafted from an entire piece of Fragrant Rosewood.\n Fragrant Rosewood was also named Dalbergia Odorifera, and it had a unique scent. More importantly, this type of wood actually had an unique and interesting property towards Consolidating Inks. It was actually able to increase the success rate of creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls by almost ten percent, and to Consolidating Equipment Masters, it could be considered an ultimate treasure.\n Behind the large fragrant rosewood desk sat two people, and their gazes were currently fixed on Zhou Weiqing.\n The one on the left looked to be around eighty years of age, an old man with white hair and a ruddy complexion, the wrinkles on his face almost able to clamp a fly to death. However, its eyes were as clear as that of a baby’s, yet so sharp and piercing as if they could see right into one’s soul.\n As soon as Zhou Weiqing met his eyes, he could feel a strange external pressure. Luckily, his spiritual energy had been raised by the dragon Hui Yao, so he did not lose his composure there and then.\n Seeing that old man, Zhou Weiqing was not surprised. After all, for a pure Consolidating Equipment Master to reach a certain level, the sheer amount of effort and vigor one had to pour into the profession was just too immense. As such, it was common that they looked older than ordinary Heavenly Jewel Masters. Those who looked like Duan Tianlang, having eaten some unique medicinal treasures that enabled him to retain his youthful looks, were definitely the minority.\n However, seated right beside the old man was a lady, and this time even Zhou Weiqing was caught by surprise. She looked to be around twenty six, twenty seven years of age. More importantly, he could clearly sense that this lady was not just using some unique treasures or arts to look young, but she was actually around that age. The active and lively youth brimming within her was not something that could be attained just from those treasures.\n Regarding these two, Zhou Weiqing was totally unable to read them, and he could just imagine what kind of cultivation level they had. Of course, the most surprising was still that lady, as he could definitely say for sure that she was not beyond the age of thirty. Yet, her cultivation level had to be at least max level Heavenly King Stage. How could that be possible?! Even for himself, with all of his fortuitous encounters, luck and talent, he still dared not guarantee that he would reach the max level Heavenly King Stage before the age of thirty!\n Besides her cultivation level, this lady was also especially attractive to Zhou Weiqing. He had seen many ladies with absolute beauty; after all, all of his own ‘intimate’ ladies were extremely beautiful. However, this lady in front of him gave him an extremely different sensation. If one had to force a comparison, perhaps this striking lady in front of him could be associated with the combined qualities of Shangguan Xue’er and Princess Cai Cai.\n Cai Cai’s impressive, dignified and noble manner, along with Shangguan Xue’er’s cold distinct beauty. Even though Shangguan Bing’er’s looks and beauty were definitely no lesser than her, she somehow slightly lacked that unique quality. \n As if unhappy that Zhou Weiqing had been staring at her, the lady gave a soft cough, furrowing her brow slightly at him.\n Zhou Weiqing grinned and said, “I apologize, young Miss, you are just too beautiful and I lost myself. Much apologies.” He did not attempt to hide his admiration as he nodded towards the lady.\n Standing beside Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Bing’er gave him an exasperated glare. She couldn’t help but think to herself that it was definitely the right choice for her to follow him here. Otherwise, who knew how many more women this naughty rascal would bring back after this trip to the XuanTian Continent.\n The lady said passively, “Your purpose of coming here is not just to praise me right? You did say one thing correctly that I agree with: only God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters have the qualification to examine another God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. So… we invite you to present your abilities now.”\n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said, “Aren’t you two going to introduce yourselves? Isn’t that a little rude?”\n The old man smiled faintly and said, “This old man has been in the Consolidating Equipment Master world for almost a hundred years, but I have never heard of this Legacy of Strength. If you have the capabilities, you will naturally know who we are soon. If you are unable to pass this test before you, then there is no reason to know who we are.”\n Zhou Weiqing smiled and said, “I still remember just a few days ago I spoke to Elder Fei Lun… Aspiration is not related to age, and a hundred years of living without aspiration is the same as not living at all. You might not know of the Legacy of Strength that I belong to, but that does not mean it does not exist.”\n A bright light flashed in the old man’s eyes, but his aura did not change in the slightest. “Young man, are you trying to provoke this old man?”\n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, a cold light flashing in his eyes. “So what if I am?”\n The old man nodded. “It has been a long time since anyone dared to speak to me like this. If you are truly able to prove yourself and create a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll, then your words will be proven right. Otherwise, you should know the consequence.”\n Zhou Weiqing had been observing the two of them closely. The reason why he spoke so bluntly was because he wanted to see if he could sense their character and reactions through this method. Without question, these two before him were the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters of the XuanTian Palace. If he were to join the XuanTian Palace, whether or not he could gain the Spatial Teleportation Gem in the future would also be closely related to these two.\n To his surprise, he discovered that when the old man was speaking, he would subconsciously glance towards the lady. Zhou Weiqing was extremely sensitive, and he immediately judged that of the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters, it was actually the lady who was in the leading position.\n “Begin then.” The lady pointed to the Spatial Ring on the Fragrant Rosewood table before she lapsed into silence.\n Shangguan Bing’er quietly closed the door behind her. Although her cultivation level was no match for Zhou Weiqing, her body was still filled with Saint Energy, and her spiritual energies and soul had also been boosted by Hui Yao previously. As such, she didn\u0027t care much about the oppressive aura drifting in and out of existence from the two in front of her.\n Zhou Weiqing picked up the Spatial Ring from the table. Sweeping through it with his will, he could sense the materials were all present within. His eyes couldn’t help but reveal a hint of gratified joy. The value of these materials could not be measured by mere gold!\n Standing there, he slowly closed his eyes, entering a state of deep thought.\n As the saying goes, as soon as an expert takes action, one would instantly be able to tell. The moment Zhou Weiqing closed his eyes, both the old man and the lady’s faces revealed a hint of surprise. They could clearly sense that in that instant, Zhou Weiqing entered a state of absolute harmony with the world, as if one with the world.\n It might sound like an easy thing to accomplish, but it was definitely extremely difficult to reach such a state. One with the world, this was a unique quality for Heavenly King stage powerhouses, but it was also a necessary quality for God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters to have. After all, when they were creating the highly complicated God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, they would have to be fully immersed in the process, not able to lose concentration for a split second or make a single mistake. Without a state of absolute harmony with the world, there was almost no possibility of success in creating a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll. This was also the most important reason why they were usually all Heavenly King stage powerhouses or higher.\n As soon as Zhou Weiqing entered, these two powerhouses had already clearly sensed that he was only at the five-Jeweled stage of Heavenly Energy. This was the reason why they had been so sure that he was definitely not a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. However, as soon as he entered the state of harmony with the world, both their expressions finally changed. To be able to enter such a state at a mere five-Jeweled cultivation level, this could not be described with the mere word of genius. He was literally a monster amongst geniuses!\n A one chi diameter crystal vat appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing, and his eyes snapped open. As they did so, there were no impurities within his gaze, just an infinite resolution.\n Right in that moment, the other three in the room showed their different understanding towards Consolidating Equipment Masters. Shangguan Bing’er only stood by the side, watching silently. Although she did not make any sound, she continued staring at Zhou Weiqing without blinking an eye, and did not seem to have any change at all. However, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters seated instantly withdrew their aura, totally erasing their presence at once. It was as if they had become a mere speck of dust in the room, bringing any possible influence they might cause to Zhou Weiqing to an absolute minimum.\n This was the tacit understanding between Consolidating Equipment Masters. Normally, for one to be able to withdraw and restrain their auras to such a degree, only a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master would be able to do so.\n However, to both their surprise, the instant they withdrew their aura and presence, Shangguan Bing’er seemed to sense something. After glancing at them, in the next moment, she actually followed suit to erase her own presence and aura. Just like Zhou Weiqing, it seemed like it was easy for her to enter a harmonious state with nature.\n In truth, the reason why both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er were able to enter such a state that usually only Heavenly King stage powerhouses were able to do was naturally the power of the Saint Energy. As the strongest Attribute existence in the world, since their bodies were full of it, they could also naturally integrate themselves into any environment. This was because their actual bodies were already beyond any environment or attribute.\n Although the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters were surprised at that sight, they did not show any emotions, instead turning their gazes back to Zhou Weiqing.\n In that instant, Zhou Weiqing sprang into motion. His right wrist flickered, and three of the materials appeared from within the Spatial Ring.\n The three materials were clearly from plants. One was a crimson red fruit, one was a black vine, while the last was an entire emerald green plant.\n When the three materials appeared, Zhou Weiqing’s left hand drew an arc in the air, a faint silver light glowing in the air abruptly to form a silvery round disc, as if it was about to hold the three materials. However, as soon as the materials touched the silver disc, they vanished like snow in the summer. Below the silver disc, only a layer of mixed liquid and powder remained. The powder looked like frosting on a cake, so fine that one could actually sense the exquisiteness of it with their eyes.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-240-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
