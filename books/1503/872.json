A rich gray mist was released from his right leg, like a cloud of black smoke, soaring up into the sky as the specks whitish gold starlight revolved around it. \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s figure had vanished; at the same time, an enormous figure appeared in the sky. Similarly, it had expanded and reached up to a height of a thousand meters in the blink of an eye. It was not at all inferior to the Destruction God, who was hovering across from it.\\n\\n It was extremely handsome, with a pair of gray eyes on that pale face. In the center of its forehead, there was a fine vein that extended downwards to the area between its eyebrows. Its massive body emitted a strong demonic aura.\\n\\n The Demon God. Indeed, it was the Demon God.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing was unable to call his Celestial Territory a true territory, and he was also unable to summon the god of his attribute like Fen Tian. However, one must not forget that he possessed power of the Demon God in his bloodline, which was one of the most powerful gods. With the appearance of the Demon God, coupled with the effects of Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Saint Energy, the omnipresent demonic aura forcefully broke the Destruction aura of the Destruction God and forcefully expanded. \\n\\n The Demon God’s body was very distinct, as though it had a material existence. If not for the fact that several people were aware that Zhou Weiqing was only a Max Level Heavenly Emperor, the spectators might assume that both Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian were evenly matched at this moment, judging by the confrontation between the Demon God and the Destruction God. \\n\\n Fen Tian’s appearance was manifested in the body of the Destruction God - its entire body was flickering with a dense purplish black light; even its eyes were bursting with purplish black rays. Its long hair was in a demonic shade of purple as well. It was filled with a ruthless aura.\\n\\n On the other side, the Demon God that Zhou Weiqing had transformed into clearly did not take on his actual appearance. It was decked in a gray robe that covered its entire body; its gray eyes were filled with endless pride. Looking at the Destruction God, its eyes were only filled with strong disdain. \\n\\n The two thousand meter tall giants were facing each other in the air. Additionally, they were both emitting powerful auras that gods possessed. The Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect powerhouses, that were originally in despair, started to have hope again. Even though they did not have a clue as for how Zhou Weiqing did it, but at least at this moment, they had a powerhouse who was strong and powerful enough to go against the enemy. \\n\\n A human-like smile appeared on the extremely handsome face of the Demon God. Coupled with its bizarre characteristics, it gave off demonic yet charming vibes.\\n\\n Even though it was smiling, its gray eyes were filled with extreme coldness. “Fen Tian, show me exactly how much god’s power does your Destruction God possess.” \\n\\n The amount of shock that Fen Tian was currently experiencing was extremely intense. What defined one as a god? A god was an existence that had transcended human beings. It possessed powers so great that it was capable of fully controlling the heavens and earth. \\n\\n The Destruction God that Fen Tian had created was definitely not an actual god. If he could transform himself into an actual god, then he would not be at the Heavenly God Stage, but the legendary Heavenly Change Stage. One could only transform into a god upon reaching the Heavenly Change Stage. If that was the case, he would not be controlled by his master anymore. \\n\\n Hence, he had merely mobilized and merged his own Destruction Energy with the Destruction Celestial Territory to create an imitation of a Destruction God. \\n\\n Even though it was just an imitation, Fen Tian could faintly sense god-level powers as well as the formidable power of the Heavenly Change stage. Hence, he could clearly sense that Zhou Weiqing’s Demon God was evidently an actual god! \\n\\n Fen Tian was very clear with regards to the fact that it was not Zhou Weiqing’s actual body. However, even though it was not Zhou Weiqing’s actual body, just by the fact that he could summon the Demon God had placed him on the losing end, based on the authenticity of the gods. \\n\\n How did he do it? How in the world did he do it? Fen Tian was completely puzzled. Regardless of his current feelings and thoughts, the battle had to go on.\\n\\n Just like what Zhou Weiqing had said, Zhou Weiqing was somewhat indecisive. In the face of a powerful Demon God, sensing the heaven-like boundless powerful aura from the Demon God’s body, Fen Tian became rather timid. He gradually lifted his enormous sword - the rich purplish black light had turned the sky behind him into a shade of purplish black. However, he got into a defensive stance.\\n\\n On the other side, the Demon God that Zhou Weiqing had metamorphosed did not move - it only stood there, quietly. The demonic rays within its gray eyes radiated all around. The overbearing pressure had forced the Destruction Celestial Territory to cave, revealing the sky. It could no longer affect the Nature Celestial Territory, and neither could it provide support for the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell powerhouses on the ground. \\n\\n This was not Zhou Weiqing’s first time summoning the Demon God. However, without a doubt, his control over the Demon God had significantly increased each time he summoned it. \\n\\n The first time, Zhou Weiqing had summoned a trace of the Demon God’s will; during the second time, he had summoned the projection of the Demon God. This time, he had truly summoned the projection of a Demon God - one with a portion of the Demon God’s abilities. \\n\\n This was Zhou Weiqing’s power. The marvel of Saint Energy was boundless - it had enhanced the power of his bloodline to the highest degree. It was impossible for Zhou Weiqing to release the actual Demon God, and he was absolutely incapable of becoming the Demon God either. However, he was able to borrow the power of the Demon God to aid him in his battle. Even though he did not know how long he was able to summon the Demon God for, at this very moment, he was the only person who could resist against Fen Tian.\\n\\n The thousand meter Fen Tian let out an angry roar. Within the sky, terrifying purplish black rays of light immediately rose dramatically, akin to endless waves, heading towards the Demon God’s gray sky and launched a frenzied attack. Rays of purplish black light transformed into enormous devouring mouths that aggressively tore and destroyed the Demonic Energy that filled the sky. \\n\\n The Demon God moved - a tinge of anger appeared on its exceedingly handsome face. It appeared as though he was truly angered by Fen Tian. His slowly raised his right hand, and suddenly, it attacked right in front. The Destruction Energy that was within tens of thousands of meters across the sky had completely solidified - just because the Demon God raised his hand.\\n\\n The Demon God had suddenly clenched his right hand tightly and immediately, an enormous crack that spanned tens of thousands of meters in the sky had appeared. \\n\\n The Destruction Energy right at the front had completely vanished in an instant; the enormous crack seemed as though it had torn the entire sky into two. The tyrannical Demonic Energy, that was like strong winds, \\n\\n Fen Tian was completely stunned - his eyes widened in shock, and two purplish black light beams shot out of his eyes. What did that Demon God do? The Demon God actually devoured my Destruction Energy. How is that possible? Could the Destruction Energy actually be devoured?\\n\\n If what Fen Tian possessed was Destruction Energy that could truly destroy the world, then it was impossible for the Demon God to devour it. Unfortunately, his Destruction Energy was similar to Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy - it was not the purest, as it contained some impurities within it. In fact, his Destruction Energy was not even as pure as Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy. One could well imagine the how powerful the devouring ability of the Demon God was - moreover, it had the support of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy. Hence, even the Destruction Energy could still be devoured by the terrifying Demonic Energy.\\n\\n Based on Zhou Weiqing’s current cultivation base, putting the summoning of the Demon God aside, under normal circumstances, he would still be unable to activate a one-time attack from the Demon God. He was solely relying on the Saint Energy! To put it simply, Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy could be described as an impure heterogeneous version of the Creation Energy.\\n\\n To any human beings, as well as a majority of gods, a Creation Energy as such was an attractive force that was deadly. Of course, this did not include the Destruction God as his own body was the opposing existence of the Creation Energy.\\n\\n Hence, Zhou Weiqing was able to borrow the Demonic Energy to summon the projection of the Demon God, which allowed the Demon God, whose actual physical body’s whereabouts was unknown, to receive the Saint Energy from Zhou Weiqing. Even though it was impure and heterogeneous, it was still a Creation Energy after all! It still offered great advantages for the Demon God.\\n\\n The enormous crack in the sky gradually sealed up. As long as the crack was not big enough to devour the entire Boundless Mainland, it could ultimately still vanish. \\n\\n Fen Tian roared in anger, with both hands holding onto the enormous dueling sword. He swung it directly at the Demon God. He no longer had the intention to test the waters. From the earlier attack, Fen Tian was absolutely positive that the Demon God that Zhou Weiqing had metamorphosed was a real Demon God. Perhaps, it was not the genuine Demon God - but it definitely possessed part of the abilities of the Demon God. If he were to test his attacks, they would end up getting devoured continuously. \\n\\n The enormous dueling sword descended from the sky. The Demon God was faced with the biting cold purplish black Destruction Energy. Suddenly, the sky sank - the entire horizon seemed to split open as a result of Fen Tian’s attack. The enormous crack extended in the direction of where Zhou Weiqing was located. \\n\\n The Demon God moved - its eyes became more dazzling at this moment. It advanced forward, instead of retreating, lifting both hands above his head and placed his palms together. \\n\\n Bam ——\\n\\n The Demonic and Destruction Energy immediately spread out, transforming into a circle of distorted ripples that erupted in mid-air. This collision had pushed the Nature Celestial Territory back by several thousands of meters. Fortunately, the battle between the Six Ultimately Heavenly God and Shen Mo was happening on the other side of the Nature Celestial Territory. Or else, the fallout of the collision would have temporarily halted their battle.\\n\\n It was also fortunate that the collision happened in the sky. Or else, it would have caused half of the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens to perish forever.\\n\\n What was even terrifying was at the back - within the sky, after the distorted ripples had been emitted, a shocking scene had unfolded. \\n\\n Fen Tian’s Destruction dueling sword was forcefully wedged between the palms of the Demon God, causing Fen Tian to be unable to advance at all. The two gods had never been closer to each other; they exchanged glances. \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-297-2","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
