{"id":51976,"no":802,"title":"Chapter 272: Ascending to Heavenly Emperor (3)","content":"Wu Yunyue was completely awakened the moment Zhou Weiqing addressed him as ‘father-in-law’. Indeed! This young man was his son-in-law after all. What was there to be dissatisfied about, passing on the reins of Heavenly Demon Sect to him? The future successor would be his own grandchild as well. Furthermore, even though this young man’s future was unknown, but it is guaranteed that as long as he could stay alive, he would become someone that surpasses Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord - someone that he would look up to. “Alright, let’s do that. My child Yuehan has long given her heart to you. Weiqing, be good to her. When we are alone, I will still address you by your name. In front of everyone else, I will address you as ‘Sect Leader’.” Zhou Weiqing laughed, “In that case, our Peerless Sect is established today. Father-in-law, I know that your heart aches for all the blood and sweat you put in but I can guarantee you that you will not regret the decision you made today. In the near future, our Peerless Sect will definitely become the strongest in the Boundless Mainland, and genuinely become the number one Saint Land.” Wu Yunyue shuddered slightly; his eyes lit up. He nodded his head towards Zhou Weiqing vigorously and said, “I look forward to that day. Later on I will get Ming Yu to pass you the name register of the members of Heavenly Demon Sect that are still alive. They are going to be your subordinates from now on.” “Thank you for your blessings, father-in-law.” Zhou Weiqing bowed. Wu Yunyue nodded his head, stood up and left. He needed some time to heal the wound in his heart. Making a decision as such was very difficult for him, but he was deeply convinced that his decision was the right one. At least among the Great Saint Lands, he was the only person who could bind the entire Saint Land and himself to Zhou Weiqing. His daughter might be the late party but his sincerity could not be compared to Heaven’s Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain. Perhaps, they would be able to see the results during the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands. “Done chatting?” Long Shiya’s deep familiar voice was heard. A flicker of light flashed - his plump body appeared within the room. “Master.” After Zhou Weiqing respectfully greeted his master, he cheerily guided Long Shiya to the Sect Leader’s seat. “Why do I feel that your smile is so sinister!” chided Long Shiya. Zhou Weiqing chuckled, “How is it sininster? Even if it is, I learned it from you! I am your disciple.” Long Shiya replied sharply, “Don’t mess around, I definitely did not teach you that. Your craftiness and cunning ways were all taught by Mu En. He’s lucky I don’t hold him accountable for this. However, I can’t deny that your father is far-sighted. Even though occasionally you do some embarrassing deeds, your survival skills improved as a result. Go ahead and tell me, what do you want from me. Don’t use that smile on me, I feel bashful.” Zhou Weiqing tried to fawn on him, “Master, you know me really well! Actually, it’s nothing much. I was just thinking that you are already of a certain age, you shouldn’t be roaming around outside that much. As your disciple, I need to take care of you! Why don’t you stay here and not leave this time? I will definitely work hard and have more children with my wives to accompany you and make you happy. What do you say?” Long Shiya laughed, “Oh give me a break, you think I don’t know your intentions? You tricked Demonic Emperor into giving Heavenly Demon Sect to you to form Peerless Sect. You’re hoping that I will help you keep up with appearances right?” Zhou Weiqing acted as though he was in shock, “Master, you can predict the future? However, I did not intend for you to keep up with appearances! I just wanted to be filial to you. Just give me this chance, alright? Furthermore, what is mine is yours - if you’re willing, the position of the Sect Leader of Peerless Sect is naturally yours.” “Oh please, cut it out. Wanting me to be the Sect Leader, isn’t it akin to wishing death upon me? Not gonna happen, I’ve had freedom my entire life, and you expect me to work for you as I’m entering my old age?” Long Shiya rolled his eyes, he seemed to have ignored Zhou Weiqing’s desperately pleading look. He knew that little fella all too well, he wasn’t gonna fall for his tricks. The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had been free his entire life, almost all the Saint Lands had invited him before but his heart had never wavered. Additionally, his disciple had already reached his full potential, hence he felt that if he were to stay, he would not be able to help much either way. However, when Zhou Weiqing mentioned that he wanted him to settle down so he could take care of him, he did feel rather touched. After all, he was getting old. Even if he used Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy to rejuvenate his youth, his mentality was not that of a young man’s any longer. Zhou Weiqing looked at his master with a fierce look on his face, “Master, don’t force my hand.” Upon seeing Zhou Weiqing’s facial expression, Long Shiya stared blankly for a bit and snorted, “Stop pretending, so what if I do? I will simply force you to accept my decision!” “You are forcing me to use my trump card!” Zhou Weiqing said resentfully. Long Shiya looked at him in surprise, “What kind of trump card do you have that will make me submit to you? I’d sure love to see it, quick show it to me. I don’t buy it, I had never been threatened by anyone before, a little twerp like you could be an exception?” Zhou Weiqing’s face eased up and he sighed, “Alright, you’re a tough nut to crack after all. In that case, forget about it. I originally planned to give your last name ‘Long’ to one of my children, who you could regard as your own grandchild. Since you’re not willing to stay, I’m unable to fulfill my filial duties. If you want to leave, you can go ahead. Since you want your freedom, as your disciple, I should not stop you.” “That’s more like it.” Long Shiyang smiled contently. Suddenly his facial muscles stiffened. He grabbed Zhou Weiqing who was about to turn and walk away, “Wait, wait a minute. What did you say? Something about grandchild and grandfather. I did not hear clearly.” He was too busy being contented, assuming that there was nothing Zhou Weiqing could use against him. He merely indistinctly heard him say something. At this moment, as he was trying to recall, his facial expression changed immediately. Zhou Weiqing smiled cheekily and said, “Nothing, nothing. Besides you’re already leaving. Whether I tell you or not, it doesn’t matter. If you didn’t catch what I said, it’s okay. Master, I have a lot of things I need to settle.” “Bastard, you are trying to play dumb with me? Quick tell me, or else don’t blame me for being unkind to you. Hmph.” Long Shiya compared his fleshy fists. Of course, he felt that his threat was probably ineffective. Needless to say, at Zhou Weiqing’s current cultivation level might prove to be too difficult for him to deal with! Zhou Weiqing turned around and face his master. This time, he stopped smiling and fell to his knees, before his master. He said earnestly, “I really hope that you will stay. Not because I need your help to run the Peerless Sect. You are already more than a hundred years old, and have wandered around for your entire life. I simply hope to give you a family, so you would stay. You can say that without you, I wouldn’t be who I am today. You have disciples but you don’t have a child. I am like a son to you. In future, my children will be your grandchildren, so just stay here and let me fulfill my filial duties. You don’t have to do anything, you only have to enjoy family love and joy. I will name one of my sons after your last name ‘Long’, for you to regard as your true-blooded grandchild, continuing your lineage. Is that ok?” Long Shiya stared blankly at Zhou Weiqing, of course he could sense that Zhou Weiqing was definitely not putting up a show. He placed his hand on Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder. Zhou Weiqing was shocked to find that given his master’s cultivation level, his hand was actually shivering. He quickly lifted his head to look at Long Shiya. “Master, are you ok?” Long Shiya looked at him, with glistening tears in his eyes. His lips quivered for a long time, yet he couldn’t speak a single word. “Master, please don’t scare me!” Zhou Weiqing hurriedly moved closer to him, and carefully channeled Saint Energy into his chest. Long Shiya’s facial expression changed, “Weiqing, you’re not teasing me right? This is really not a joke right?” Zhou Weiqing wanted to laugh and cry at the same time, “Master, am I that bad a person? Look at how serious I’m being. how can I possibly be joking?” Long Shiya retorted, “When you lied to those people from Blood Red Hell, your emotions seemed very sincere as well. In the end they got played out by you.” “How can you be compared to them! Master, I really am not joking with you. I just want to take care of you till you’re old.” Long Shiya raised both hands and used his might to grab Zhou Weiqing’s arms, with tears flowing from his eyes. “Thank you, child. It’s been almost 90 years since I experienced familial love. In future my life will be in your hands.” “Master……” Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed at the unexpected good news, and gave Long Shiya a tight hug. Long Shiya’s emotions seemed to stabilize, he wiped his tears and said, “Go ahead, your Senior Uncle Duan is looking for you. You have already become a Heavenly Emperor, you should consolidate the last piece of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set.” “Senior Uncle is looking for me?” Zhou Weiqing relaxed his arms and looked at Long Shiya who’s facial expression had returned to normal. “Master, in that case I better hurry.” Zhou Weiqing’s respect for Duan Tianlang was not any less than his respect for his master. When he heard that his Senior Uncle was looking for him, he naturally did not dare to slight him. Long Shiya waved his hand, indicating that he should get going. Zhou Weiqing turned around and left. The moment he stepped out of the door, he seemed to have heard a happy voice cheering, “Wahaha, wahaha, I’ll have a grandchild, I’ll have a descendant. Wahaha.” When Zhou Weiqing heard that, he stared blankly for a moment before smiling widely. He knew his master all too well. Even though Long Shiya held his freedom in high regard, not having family, as well as family love, was his biggest regret. As his disciple, Zhou Weiqing naturally wanted to help him overcome this regret of his! He had five wives, he wouldn’t be lacking in children or descendants. Furthermore, even if his child were to take the last name ‘Long’, he would still be his son.
