(1)\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing looked curiously at Mu En, thinking to himself: Teacher Scoundrel, how did you manage to do that? Of course, now was not the time to ask questions, and he could only hide his curiosity in his heart.\\n\\n Hearing Zhou Weiqing call out ‘Teacher’, Shen Bu sensed a massive pressure about her, coming from all directions, making her feel as if she could not breath. However, that pressure was actually self inflicted. That Zhou Weiqing fellow was already so disgusting, and his teacher was actually also in the army camp. Although he was dressed in an ordinary army uniform, looking in disarray, the waistline of his pants stretched to its maximum limit… still, he was still Zhou Weiqing’s teacher!\\n\\n Long Shiya walked over to Zhou Weiqing’s side before tilting his head. His eyes still seemed a little drowsy from drink; clearly he had not used his Heavenly Energy to detoxicate himself.\\n\\n “Ehh, isn’t that the little brat Green Wolf? He was still drinking happily with me last night, and Your Father, I, managed to drink him under the table. Why is he laying here pretending to be dead?”\\n\\n As he said that, Long Shiya bent down and grabbed hold of Green Wolf.\\n\\n “Teacher, Green Wolf is critically injured. You…” Zhou Weiqing hurriedly said. However, before he could complete his sentence, his eyes widened.\\n\\n As Green Wolf was hoisted up, a layer of dim gold light sprang about his entire body. Atop his head, an illusory looking gold symbol formed out of the gold light, looking like an extremely cute little angel. The next moment, Green Wolf’s entire body seemed to turn gold in colour, as if someone had painted his entire body with gold paint.\\n\\n “Aiiiyyyaaah, that hurts so bad!” Green Wolf’s cry of pain suddenly rang out.\\n\\n Long Shiya’s other hand clapped down on his chest before puling back, looking rather clumsy as he did so. However, that caved-in chest of Green Wolf’s seemed to puff back out, and under the cover of the gold light, his entire body started to tremble and shake.\\n\\n “Tonight, remember to come and accompany this old man to drink again.” Long Shiya flicked his wrist, and Green Wolf stumbled and reeled to the back. However, a miracle occurred as Green Wolf stumbled… Originally on the verge of death, he suddenly recovered his balance and stood up tall. His own face was a mask of surprise, but no matter how they looked at him, he did not look like he had been on his last breath just moments ago. If not for the fact there was still blood at his lips, no one would believe that this fellow had been injured at all.\\n\\n “Master, you’re too great!” Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed. At this moment, he truly felt like jumping over to hug his teacher and give him a kiss. In truth, he was also in a tough dilemma, having ridden a tiger and was now finding it hard to get off[1. Literal translation, basically in a tough position]. Previously, he had been in such a rage, and he could not easily take back those savage words; otherwise he would lose all credibility in front of his Peerless Battalion brothers.\\n\\n However, if they really took action against the Sixteenth Regiment, although they would not have any problems taking them down, that would also mean the end of them being able to stay in the northern army camp. That would be a huge blow to Zhou Weiqing’s original plan. At the same time, he did not have any time for regrets, and could only hope that Shen Bu would give in. However, his own demands were extremely harsh and severe, and it was unlikely that she would do so.\\n\\n Now, Long Shiya and Mu En’s appearance could be said to be at a perfect moment. With a single easy action, Long Shiya had healed green Wolf. Ignoring the stunningly frightening power he showed, just the fact that Green Wolf would live meant that the greatest conflict between both sides had been resolved… and there was a chance for a favourable turn to events.\\n\\n “Battalion Commander.” Green Wolf looked towards Zhou Weiqing. Such a tall stout man like him, but his eyes reddened in that moment. He had known of Zhou Weiqing’s arrival, and had also heard all his words clearly, though he had not been able to speak due to his injuries. He had never expected that Zhou Weiqing would go far with the Sixteenth Regiment for his sake.\\n\\n Being a ruffian or scoundrel did not mean that they did not have feelings, just that perhaps they were much better at hiding their feelings than ordinary people, masking it under their surface cunning or violence. However, once such people actually opened their hearts, they would undoubtedly be much stronger than ordinary.\\n\\n In that instance, Green Wolf looked to Zhou Weiqing totally as his true big brother… no matter that his own age was actually higher than Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n At this point, if Zhou Weiqing were to send him to his death, he would do so unhesitatingly. A gentleman would die for a patron who recognizes his worth, a scholar would die for his bosom friend [1. Direct translation, but the meaning should be pretty clear] These words were a perfect description of Green Wolf’s current feelings.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing glared at him exasperatedly. “You useless bum, can you do things properly? Losing a fight and almost being beaten to death… if you lose don’t you know how to call for help?! Or run?! Tcheh, go back there, I’ll deal with you after we settle this over here.”\\n\\n “Yes, yes, Battalion Commander, this old wolf will take any punishment. In the future, this life of mine is yours, absolutely loyal to the core.[2. The words he used could also be used to describe a woman’s loyalty to her husband, hence the next line]”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing almost burst out laughing, the tightened muscles of his face couldn’t help but twitch as he restrained himself. “Loyalty your head! Your Father, I, do not love men that way! Get lost!”\\n\\n As soon as he said that, the Peerless Battalion soldiers, who had been full of anger, all burst out laughing. Green Wolf also turned red in embarrassment, though his heart was also filled with gratitude, as if being scolded by Zhou Weiqing was an honour. He quickly turned and ran to the back.\\n\\n “Wait…” Zhou Weiqing called him back. “You fool, who just saved your life?!”\\n\\n Only then did Green Wolf react. He was after all an intelligent man, and he suddenly knelt down towards Long Shiya and kowtowed down. “Thank you, sire, for saving my life.”\\n\\n Long Shiya laughed heartily and said: “Get up… just come accompany this old man drinking at night. Look at how you seem now, so useless, what are you kneeling for.”\\n\\n Green Wolf grinned and made a wine-drinking action at Long Shiya before hastily running off to the back.\\n\\n Wei Feng had been looking on at the side, and he saw that the opportune time had come. As the Vice Battalion Commander, he was clear that it was a good time for him to step forward in a mediating role. After all, now that there was an excuse, it would be a good thing for both sides to step back… otherwise would they really slaughter the entire Sixteenth Regiment party?\\n\\n “What are you all doing? Aren’t you tired of drawing your bows for so long? Settle down first, wait and see.” Wei Feng said exasperatedly to the men. His words were naturally designed to ease up the atmosphere, but also to show to the Sixteenth Regiment that though they were taking a step back, this matter was not finished yet.\\n\\n Right at that moment, a hurried galloping sound could be heard in the near distance. Hearing the sound, Zhou Weiqing heaved a sigh of relief inwardly. He knew that they would not actually end up fighting for real after all. Lifting his leg, he gave a kick and sent the Heavy Cavalry Battalion Commander back in front of Shen Bu. That fellow had been nearly fully drained by Zhou Weiqing’s Devour Skill, and he just lay there unmoving. If not for the fact that Zhou Weiqing had held back, he would have already been drained til death. After all, the Devour Skill could not only drain Heavenly Energy, but also life force, and it all depended on what Zhou Weiqing wanted to focus on. As for the suction force that had pulled him in earlier, that was actually a form of the Devour Skill that he had used the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts to mimic and change.\\n\\n After two days of fighting, the more Zhou Weiqing used the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, the more miraculous he found it was, always seeming to have an endless possibility in usage and myriad potential to delve deeper in. Who said that it would not be able to help him now… just the fine grained control in his various Attribute Heavenly Energy was similar to Shangguan Fei’er’s close combat skills, helping him in all forms of combat. Most noticeably, when he was using any Skills, he was able to save a lot of Heavenly Energy by reducing wastage. Zhou Weiqing had barely stepped into the doorway of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, learning everything on his own for the past six months without direct tutelage from Long Shiya, and he found that his anticipation of this Skill was growing by leaps and bounds.\\n\\n Shen Bu’s expression was ugly, but… she somehow did not flare out. Instead, her gaze was constant fixed upon Long Shiya, a flash of fear and doubt flickering in her eyes.\\n\\n All of a sudden, the Sixteenth Regiment soldiers parted to form a path, and the Legion Commander of the Seventh Legion, Shen Ji, under the escort of over a dozen of his personal guards, rode in. He swiftly dismounted as soon as he reached the front.\\n\\n “What is going on? All of you calm down.” How could he not sense the strong smell of gunpowder in the air between both sides. Luckily, Shen Bu had some sense in her, and she had sent word to Shen Ji before bringing her men over. Seeing that her Senior Brother had arrived, only then did Shen Bu breathe a sigh of relief.\\n\\n Shen Ji’s expression was also not pretty. The reason why he had asked the Ruffian Battalion to return to the main northern army camp was mainly because of the background of Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er, and the fact they were from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace; to get in their good books. Who knew that just a single day after the Ruffian Battalion had returned, trouble had arisen… and from the looks of things, the trouble was not small at all.\\n\\n Facing Shen Ji’s piercing and forceful gaze, Zhou Weiqing did not back down. Although he felt regret now that his rash impulsion had caused the Peerless Battalion’s power to be revealed despite his efforts in hiding them, there was no use crying over spilt milk. As such, he might as well carry on in an aggressive and arrogant fashion, to teach the Sixteenth Regiment a lasting lesson.\\n\\n “What is going on? Legion Commander Shen Ji, you will have to ask your Junior Sister that question.” Zhou Weiqing said coldly.\\n\\n Shen Ji looked towards Shen Bu curiously, and she dared not hide anything, telling her everything that had happened.\\n\\n Hearing her words, Shen Ji’s expression grew even ugly, and he gave her an angry look. He couldn’t help but think inwardly: I have already warned you not to provoke these ruffians, why must you still cause all that trouble? If this grows any further, even Master will not be able to save you!\\n\\n “Ridiculous! What do you both think this place is? This is the main camp of the northern command army, and both of you are officers in your own right, and yet you allow such a thing to happen?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said coldly: “Legion Commander Shen Ji, I have already given you a lot of face by not taking action right away. Now that you are here, that is good, you better uphold justice. Those Sixteenth Regiment soldiers purposely threw rubbish in our camp site, and all I did was to get my brothers to return it to them. This morning, they actually dared to come to our camp again to cause trouble.”\\n\\n “If I do not remember wrongly, according to army rules, without prior permission, no soldiers are allowed to enter other barracks or camps which do not belong to them. I ask that Legion Commander Shen Ji upholds military law and justice.”\\n\\n “Nonsense, it was clearly your men who attacked first!” One of the Battalion Commanders at Shen Bu’s side cried out angrily.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said disdainfully: “My men took action first? Very good… let me ask you… if someone came to your house, entered the door, and started scolding you, what would you do? This is our Peerless Battalion camp, our territory, and your men came here to look for trouble. Who knows if you are spies from the WanShou Empire, disguised here to look for information. Not killing you all is already very kind of us.”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-151-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
