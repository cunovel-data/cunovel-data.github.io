I’m not like a certain someone who blabbers about being a ‘teacher’ while actually doing nothing at all, spending all his days running off to god-knows-where to relax. Xue’er and Fei’er came back from Heavenly Jewel Island with the materials I needed, and so I immediately started working hard. Weiqing only needed one scroll of each in order to fully consolidate. Otherwise, I really wouldn’t have been able to accomplish it.”\n Zhou Weiqing’s eyes instantly moistened as he looked at Duan Tianlang. When he had first met Duan Tianlang, this Senior Uncle of his had still looked fairly young. Now, after just a few short years, his hair had turned white. Although his eyes were still bright, they held deep within them an unmistakable exhaustion. Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but feel his heart ache in pain.\n “Senior Uncle.” Zhou Weiqing stepped forwards to grip Duan Tianlang by the man’s big hand.\n Duan Tianlang used his other hand to pat him on the shoulder. “We’re family. In fact, you can be considered half my apprentice as well as the heir to my Legacy of Strength. Although you’ve never really developed as a Consolidating Equipment Master, I naturally did what I promised you I would. Besides… completing the full Hate Ground No Handle Set was my one of my greatest dreams. Now that I’ve finished both Hate Sky No Handle and Hate Ground No Handle, I have no regrets left.”\n Zhou Weiqing held onto Duan Tianlang’s big hand. He could clearly sense that although his Senior Uncle looked normal on the surface, his vital essence was extremely weak. He could die at any moment.\n Tears began to drip down from Zhou Weiqing’s face. He couldn’t help but reach out to give Duan Tianlang a very, very big hug.\n Long Shiya could no longer keep smiling. He stared at his old friends, his own eyes filled with deep worry. He knew better than anyone else what Duan Tianlang’s body was like. He had actually left for the purpose of finding Duan Tianlang some precious ingredients which could be used for him to repair his body, but he didn’t imagine that Duan Tianlang would have finished the Hate Ground No Handle Set so quickly. Now that he had already completed his life’s work, his vital essence would probably splutter out! The treasures Long Shiya had brought back would probably be useless.\n Right at this moment, a faint golden light came out of Zhou Weiqing’s body. Something strange happened. Specks of golden light actually flew out of his body, causing the entire tent to become filled with a strange, munificent aura. Starlight glittered, transforming the insides of the tent into the starry skies. The specks of astral light flew out in each direction, then circled towards Duan Tianlang. They weren’t that fast, but each time one of them entered his body he couldn’t help but tremble slightly.\n “Weiqing, don’t!” Duan Tianlang cried out involuntarily. However, he could no longer stop Zhou Weiqing, whose arms were around him. It was actually impossible for him to move.\n In terms of cultivation base, he was naturally above Zhou Weiqing. He was an old and experienced Heavenly King, after all. But Zhou Weiqing was no ordinary Heavenly King. He had Saint Energy! If Duan Tianlang was still able to break free after being grabbed like this, Zhou Weiqing would have no face left.\n Dense Saint Energy ripples spread through the air as the specks of astral light continued to pour into his body. Duan Tianlang discovered to his astonishment that his spluttering heart meridians, which were at risk of shattering at any time due to him having exhausted his vital essence, was actually beginning to slowly turn firm and strong again. Every single cell in his body was being awakened by those specks of astral light, which didn’t cause his body any damage at all. In fact, even his own Heavenly Energy welcomed this foreign energy in a very natural manner.\n The specks of starlight began to appear within the Saint Energy inside his body. Duan Tianlang felt as though his entire body had been submerged in a hot spring. It was indescribably comfortable. Everything within his body seemed to be waking up. His organs, his bones, his meridians… at this moment, they seemed to be going through a new spring. Zhou Weiqing didn’t give him his own vital force; rather, he used a strange technique to rebuild Duan Tianlang’s body.\n The human body was something created by nature. What Zhou Weiqing gave Duan Tianlang was this sort of creative vitality. In doing this, he actually used up far more energy than he would in merely enhancing Duan Tianlang’s vital essence.\n Duan Tianlang’s eyes turned rather distant. He felt as though he had returned to his youth. His heart, which had sunken into a deathly melancholy, actually come back to life. He felt as though he could now do many of the things he did in his youth.\n He suddenly thought of a joke Long Shiya had told him in the past. Back then, Long Shiya had told him him what brotherhood meant. “What are brothers? Brothers are those who, when you are sick in bed and unable to rise, will pour water and boil tea for you, feed you, and wash you. Even if you no longer care for such matters, during your final days your brother will bring a pair of beauties to meet with you. At that point, you’ll definitely say, ‘Help me up. I’ll give’m a shot.’”\n Perhaps it really was time to give it a shot.\n The sparkling astral light continued to do its work for ten minutes before slowly returning into Zhou Weiqing’s body. Zhou Weiqing relaxed his grip, smiling at the Duan Tianlang, whose eyes were still rather hazy.\n Long Shiya had been standing nearby and watching. He knew better than anyone else what had happened, because he saw with his own eyes how Duan Tianlang’s white hair managed to slowly, miraculously turn black again, starting from the roots and all the way upwards. The skin and muscles on his face began to firm up again. He seemed to have instantly become ten years younger!\n Long Shiya stared, dazed, at Duan Tianlang as the latter grew younger and younger. He crept over to Zhou Weiqing and then sent through voice-transference: “Weiqing, are you alright? Did that exhaust you much?”\n Zhou Weiqing chuckled and shook his head. “I’m fine. That was nothing. I used atmospheric energies, converted it into Saint Energy, then revitalized Master-Uncle’s body. Although he didn’t actually grow decades younger, it’ll be easy for him live for several more decades. Heh heh.”\n “Are you sure it didn’t cost you too much?” Long Shiya widened his beady little eyes which were hidden within those folds of flesh.\n Zhou Weiqing nodded. “Don’t worry, Master. I always know what I’m doing.”\n Long Shiya’s smile suddenly turned rather flattering. “Then, uh, when do you think you’ll have the time to do the same for Master? Master wants to be young too! Maybe I’ll end up finding someone for you to call Master-Wife.”\n Zhou Weiqing laughed out loud. He wrapped an arm around Long Shiya’s shoulder and said, “Of course! How could I forget about you? You’ll definitely get a chance as well.”\n Saint Energy truly was filled with endless mysteries. After his Astral Saint Core Nucleus took form, it continued to give Zhou Weiqing more and more abilities. Just now, everything which Zhou Weiqing had done for Duan Tianlang had simply come out of his excited emotions. It was actually something of an experiment, and it was proven to be a success. Duan Tianlang’s vital essence really had been revived by him.\n After this test, Zhou Weiqing realized that he actually had the special ability to help others extend their lifespan. It must be understood that such an ability was an indescribable bit of good fortune for developing the Heavenly Bow Empire!\n Long Shiya clapped Zhou Weiqing on the back, very satisfied. Although he had been rather joking when he made the request, in his heart he couldn’t help but sigh. Not too long ago, when he had first met this disciple of his, the kid’s cultivation base had been as low as an ant’s. Now, just a few short years later, he had become someone who even Long Shiya himself had to treat with as an equal. He also had this extremely marvelous ability. This could no longer be described as unnaturally blessed with talent; this was him being Heaven’s favored son!\n Duan Tianlang was dazed for ten full minutes before slowly recovering. When he looked at Zhou Weiqing, his gaze became rather odd. He sighed softly, “Weiqing, why did you do this? Although I don’t know what power you used, will it cause you any harm?”\n Zhou Weiqing hurriedly shook his head. “Definitely not. Look at me, don’t I look like I’m filled with vitality? ‘Creation’ is a special property of my Saint Energy. You sacrificed so much for me, Senior Uncle. I’m not harmed, but even if I was I wouldn’t regret it. Besides… I need you to produce another marvel for me.”\n Duan Tianlang said, amazed, “Produce another marvel? What sort of marvel?”\n Zhou Weiqing said solemnly, “Senior Uncle, during my recent trip to the Xuantian Continent I discovered an eleven-piece Legendary Set.” He immediately gave a brief narration of his trip to the Xuantian Continent while describing Dongfang Hanyue’s Tenebrous Demon Dragon Set.\n Duan Tianlang’s eyes were filled with amazement when he heard this story. “To become one with a dragon? The Xuantian Continent actually has such a marvelous Legendary Set?”\n Zhou Weiqing nodded. “The Xuantian Palace Master merely had the cultivation of a middle-stage Heavenly Emperor, but this Legendary Set actually allowed her to battle against a Heavenly God powerhouse like the Terror Sea Dragon. You can imagine how effective and powerful this set was! Our Legacy of Strength lineage has existed for many years. Why can’t we produce a similar eleven-piece Legendary Set? Our predecessors were able to follow up on the Hate Sky No Handle Set to create the Hate Ground No Handle Set. I believe, Master, that you can definitely create an eleventh piece of this set.”\n Zhou Weiqing understood Duan Tianlang’s personality perfectly. He didn’t wish for his Senior Uncle to feel guilty for having received his aid, and he also wanted to give Duan Tianlang a reason to keep living. Without question, applying his efforts to another Consolidating Scroll was the best option.\n Duan Tianlang nodded slowly, but a pained smile was on his face. “Adding another piece onto a ten-piece set isn’t going to be easy! In fact, it’ll be much more complicated than creating a ten-piece set.”\n Zhou Weiqing chortled. “Senior Uncle, I’ve always believed that so long as you are determined, nothing is impossible. Look at me. I’ve never trained too hard in Consolidating Scrolls, but I’ve still become a God-Tier Master.”\n “Huh?” Both Duan Tianlang and Long Shiya couldn’t help but let out startled shouts.\n “You are now God-Tier?” Duan Tianlang immediately stepped forward to face Zhou Weiqing, gripping the latter’s shoulders. His face was filled with wild, indescribable joy. In fact, he was now far more excited than he felt after having his body improved and gaining ten years of life.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-262-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
