(3) Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “You don’t have to care what we are doing first, in any case, I will be the commanding officer then. You don’t want to have me bruised and battered and unable to go out… in that case I wouldn’t be able to bring you out to play tonight.” Shangguan Fei’er thought about it for a moment, then turned to look at Zhou Weiqing. “Alright, I’ll let you off this time. However, if tonight’s operation isn’t fun, you’re dead! Oh right, just now I also helped you proclaim… I am now the overall drillmaster of the Peerless Battalion, in charge of their combat skills. They have also acknowledged my post. In the future, you must call me Drillmaster Shangguan. Not bad, not bad, in the future, I’ll have a lot of targets to practice on.” Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but think to himself. You’re so violent, how could they dare to not acknowledge it. At this point, Wei Feng returned as well. Seeing Shangguan Fei’er in the tent, his expression changed as well, and he greeted her with even more respect than towards Zhou Weiqing. “Greetings, Drillmaster Shangguan.” “En.” Shangguan Fei’er nodded at him. No wonder Wei Feng was so respectful; it was just that he had just seen the sorry state of the few Company Leaders outside that caused it! Black Bear had been beaten up by a mob, that was bad enough right? However, compared to Green Wolf and the others, he was considered lucky, at least he was still recognizable, still able to walk. Yet, Green Wolf and the others had to be carried back; looking at them, it would be at least a day or two before they could even get back on their feet. At the same time, they had not sustained any heavy or lasting injuries. Thinking back to what Zhou Weiqing had said about how Shangguan Fei’er was even more ‘abnormal’ than he was, how could Wei Feng not be extra respectful? Opening up the map in front of Zhou Weiqing, Wei Feng said: “This is the situation of the northern army camps, all in fine detail. As you know, we have nothing much else to do here, so every other time we will try and perfect the map, just to see if there is any chance for us to escape somehow. Zhou Weiqing looked at the map, and saw that it was indeed extremely clear and detailed, with each and every camp shown. “Vice Commander Wei, let me have this map to study for a while, you go and let everyone register what they have managed to gain this time. When Shen Bu sends someone to buy back the heavy cavalry equipment, we can then give out the money accordingly.” Wei Feng’s brow furrowed and he said worriedly: “Battalion Commander, a heavy cavalry equipment is worth quite a sum. Although the Sixteenth Regiment is a cavalry regiment, they will not be able to withstand such a loss out of combat. What if that Regiment Commander Shen Bu is so enraged that she attacks us, what do we do then?” Zhou Weiqing smiled passively and said: “Let her come then. Dispatch a few brothers who are extremely fast to keep watch on any movement on the Sixteenth Regiment side. You guys can even avoid the WanShou Empire armies, are you still afraid of a single Regiment? Furthermore, I have seventy percent confidence that Shen Bu will not lead her forces to attack us, unless she wants to be court martialed. In order to muster troop movements over a thousand… it is impossible to keep it hidden from the northern command. With the power that we have displayed today, they know that without at least several Battalion, how could they possibly take us down? No matter how angry Shen Bu is, she will have to tolerate it.” Wei Feng looked at Zhou Weiqing with a hint of surprise in his eyes. On the surface, this young Battalion Commander seemed to be overly audacious, perhaps even arrogant, to even dare rob the heavy cavalry units. However, in truth, he had already thought things through extremely thoroughly. At least, on the surface, what he said was extremely true, as even sending the single Company of heavy cavalry soldiers was actually against the army rules. After all, no matter what, the Ruffian Battalion was still considered part of the ZhongTian forces... As long as they were able to balance this well, and without going too far or killing anyone, it was not that easy for Shen Bu to do anything to the Peerless Battalion. As he thought up to this point, it was as if Wei Feng suddenly saw the light, feeling a sense of cheer he had not had in a long time. His previous pessimistic outlook of tonight’s operation was suddenly dissipated, and he felt more relaxed. … Nightfall. The entire north seemed even more bleak and chilly, a desolate feel during this time. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er were fully dressed in their armour as they walked out of the tent. Both of them were in Battalion Commander gear; of course, Shangguan Fei’er’s one was stolen from Shen Yi. Down the hill, a hundred Peerless Battalion soldiers were gathered, fully dressed in heavy cavalry equipment and mounted atop the warhorses. This was also why Zhou Weiqing had asked Wei Feng to register who had gotten the equipment, as he needed to borrow them all for this night operation. As he looked up into the sky, a bolt of silver light shot forth from Zhou Weiqing’s body, disappearing into the tent. It was the Silver Emperor, Little Red Bean. From Wei Feng, Zhou Weiqing had learned that the WanShou Empire usually launched their attacks around the autumn season, usually after the harvest. At that time, they were facing the prospect of the incoming bitter winter, a time when there would be a severe lack of food. The war would generally last throughout the entire autumn and until the beginning of winter. This years war had already ended, and the winter season was near its close. As such, for some time, the WanShou Empire should not be attacking, at least not with any large forces. In the last war with the WanShou Empire, the Ruffian Battalion had lost more than three hundred men, not from actual fighting, but starved to death while hiding in the underground tunnels. Otherwise, they would number a thousand five hundred now, not just a thousand two hundred men. In the end, they had been forced to scavenge on the corpses of the beasts that the WanShou Empire armies had left behind in order to barely survive. For this night’s operation, Zhou Weiqing had asked Wei Feng to gather those who were skilled at riding horses, without the need to focus too much on strength. The Peerless Battalion soldiers all had a unique, ferocious aura about them, and with their large figures, dressed in the heavy cavalry armour, they did look the part at least. Furthermore, with the stolen cotton garb from the heavy cavalry, it also helped them withstand the cold much better. Zhou Weiqing had left Little Red Bean as well as Da Huang and Er Huang, his two Icy Soul Heavenly Bears, behind. Although there was little chance that the WanShou Empire would attack, he did not want to take any risks. With Little Red Bean there, as long as it wasn’t too huge an enemy force, it was sufficient to scare most enemies away. “Today’s operation is actually very simple. You only have two tasks; firstly, to do your best to be in proper formation, and no one is allowed to talk. If the operation is successful, every brother who joins today’s operation will be rewarded with five gold coins. Each of you are in charge of each other, anyone who speaks you must report it immediately, and the person who speaks will lose out a gold coin, and the reporter will gain the additional gold coin. Secondly, you are to obey all orders, as long as it does not influence your gain or to send you to your death, you must obey them all strictly. Otherwise, similarly, you will be fined of your reward. Do you all understand?” “Understood.” The hundred replies were not in sync, but definitely loud and full of energy. Zhou Weiqing did not bring Wei Feng along for this operation, and he now beckoned to him. “Vice Commander Wei Feng, we will be back soon. I’ll leave the camp to you, as well as the coordinating task.” Wei Feng nodded and said: “Battalion Commander, be careful.” Nodding, Zhou Weiqing turned around and shouted out loud: “Move out.” Both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er immediately released their Ghost Demon Horses from their Spatial Realms, and their steeds’ powerful stature immediately drew the attention of the Peerless Battalion soldiers. Zhou Weiqing rode to the front of the party along with Shangguan Fei’er before heading towards the northern command camp with this Company of seemingly heavy cavalry soldiers. The traveling speed of heavy cavalry was relatively slower compared to most cavalry units, and it was more than two hours before they neared the northern command camp. On the way, they had met several patrols. However, upon seeing that they were heavy cavalry soldiers, especially with Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er mounted on Ghost Demon horses, they only gave a cursory questioning before letting them on their way. Towards the questions, Zhou Weiqing’s answer was extremely simple, that they were on a secret mission. Though the camp was in sight, they were still a few kilometres away. Zhou Weiqing ordered them all to stop before opening the map to verify their position. Very quickly, he focused on a particular spot, and he said: “This is our target. Come with me.” The heavy cavalry soldiers behind him were all silent. That ‘fining’ system of Zhou Weiqing had indeed worked well… no one wanted to be fined, or to give the one beside them any advantage. “Halt! The granary storage area is a restricted zone. Which Regiment are you all from?” As they were reaching their target area, they were stopped by infantry guards. This was one of the northern army main granary warehouse zones, situated between the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Regiments. Zhou Weiqing sat atop his single horned Ghost Demon Horse without speaking a word, and Shangguan Fei’er by his side took out the plaque from her bosom. “You, don’t you even recognize us from the Sixteenth Regiment?” Naturally, that plaque she took out belonged to Shen Yi. “Ohh, so you are the brothers from the Sixteenth Regiment. It is already so late, what are you here for?” A Company Leader walked out from behind, bowing slightly to them, looking enviously at their Ghost Demon Horses. Zhou Weiqing said solemnly: “Our Regiment Commander has orders for us to collect some rations and supplies. Where is the quartermaster? Ask him to come see me.” These granary zones were usually to provide for four Regiments, and the quartermaster in charge was usually a Battalion Commander, but compared to a Battalion Commander who actually led troops, their status was a bit lower. Of course, at the same time, this post was an extremely lucrative post one. Seeing the gleaming armour of the troops behind Zhou Weiqing, as well as the impressive horned Ghost Demon Horse under him, the Company Leader did not dare delay them. “Sir, please wait, I’ll send for the lord quartermaster immediately.” After saying that, the Company Leader immediately dispatched a soldier to report to the quartermaster. Zhou Weiqing jumped down from the Ghost Demon Horse lightly, and the Company Leader came up and said softly: “Sir, you are from the Ghost Demon Horse Legion? This Ghost Demon Horse is truly impressive! It must be invincible on the battlefield.” Zhou Weiqing did not reply, a haughty look on his face. In a few minutes, the quartermaster, a soldier around forty years of age, came down under the escort of ten soldiers. Originally, he was in quite a bad mood. After all, who wouldn’t be after being awoken from sleep in the middle of the night. Although he was not leading any troops, his status in the army was still relatively important, and ordinary Battalion Commanders did not have his respect. However, when he saw Zhou Weiqing’s single horned Ghost Demon Horse, the unhappiness on his face disappeared, and he took a quick step forward and extended his hand in greeting. “Ohhh, which Battalion Commander of the Sixteenth Regiment is this, you do not look too familiar!” Zhou Weiqing lifted his hand to grasp his in return, saying passively: “I have just been transferred over from the Ghost Demon Horse Legion, it is normal that you do not know me.” As they spoke, their eyes met, and at that moment, the quartermaster saw a pair of purple red eyes. As Zhou Weiqing was much taller than him, all he could only see that purple red. If at that time Zhou Weiqing’s upper body was naked, then they would all be able to see that the image of the Demonic Dragon Lady appearing.
