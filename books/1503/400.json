(2)\n Sending some energy back was after all the Solidified Dragon Spirit using excess energy to vitalize Zhou Weiqing’s body, and it was supposed to very good for his body.\n Alas, Zhou Weiqing was no ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master. He already had the bloodline of the Dark Demon God Tiger. As such, trouble befell him.\n When the energy sending of the Solidified Dragon Spirit occurred, bringing about the heat energy into Zhou Weiqing’s body, it had sparked the energy of the Dark Demon God Tiger. Sensing an intruder, how could the overbearing Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline allow it? As such, the two bloodline powers had clashed savagely against each other.\n If not for the power of the Dark Demon God Tiger at this point, perhaps Zhou Weiqing would have only felt the heat rise within him, and before long he would have been pleasantly surprised to find that his body had gained much. Alas, that had not happened, and the current situation was extremely troublesome. The strength of the Solidified Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline powers were equal, and clashing against each other, it was as if his body was being used as a battlefield. With the two totally opposite powers clashing against each other, one hot and one cold, how could he be well at all?\n This was a huge problem for Zhou Weiqing, causing to be in critical danger, even more so than when he was breaking through his Death Acupuncture Points.\n Just like what Shangguan Fei’er had guessed, currently Zhou Weiqing was in unbelievable pain, more than he had ever felt before. Alas, he did not have control of his body, but his consciousness was still awake, and he could feel everything.\n He could clearly sense everything that Shangguan Fei’er had done and hear her voice. When he sensed that she was heavily injured by touching him, he felt urgent in his heart. Yet, Shangguan Fei’er had actually hugged him instead.\n Her thick Heavenly Energy entered Zhou Weiqing’s body, greatly reducing his pain. However, at the same time, Zhou Weiqing could sense that the life was draining from her at a rapid rate along with her shuddering.\n No… Fei’er… stop… let go of me...\n Zhou Weiqing could only scream that out in his heart, as he could not move his mouth.\n Fei’er is going to die… Fei’er is going to die. Zhou Weiqing felt as if his brain was about to explode. Currently, he hated himself so much, hated the energy within his body. When Shangguan Fei’er hugged him and said that she was willing to give up everything for him, he felt as if his heart had melted.\n All he wanted to do now was for her to leave him, to stop her from feeling this pain.\n The piercing pain of the spirit was also influencing his body. The sixteen energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points were whirling intensely, trying their best to bring harmony between the two clashing bloodlines. Alas, it was like quenching the fire of a cartload of firewood with one cup of water[1. Direct translation of chinese idiom. Basically means not much effect], barely keeping an equilibrium so that did not explode and kill Zhou Weiqing.\n At this point, Zhou Weiqing’s heart was crazed. In order to save Shangguan Fei’er, he did not care anymore, and without hesitation, he did something that was literally crazy.\n He could not move his body, but he knew his will could still slightly affect the energy within. In order to rescue Shangguan Fei’er, he had to regain control of his body, at least momentarily. In order to achieve that, he had to stop the two bloodline powers in his body from fighting with each other.\n With Zhou Weiqing’s current cultivation, he could not possibly do that even if he could regain full control of his Heavenly Energy, and he was very clear about that. As such, his next move was a bold one, perhaps one that could be described as almost suicidal.\n Zhou Weiqing actually withdrew all the Heavenly Energy automatically circulating from the sixteen energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points which had been protecting him. Using all his willpower and all his might, he shoved all of the energy right towards his seventeenth Death Acupuncture Point.\n ShenQue Death Acupuncture Point. [2.http://baike.baidu.com/view/389284.htm]\n Location: Right between the lungs\n Belonging to the category of the Ren Meridians. Once broken through, will cause shock to the nerves, intestinal tract, arms, overall loss of function to body parts.\n Zhou Weiqing had already broken through to the sixteenth Death Acupuncture Point for quite some time, and ever since he had left the Heavenly Jewel Island, he had been training extremely hard, though he had stopped using the Devour Skill for cultivating purposes. Previously, he had used it to breakthrough the Sixteenth Death Acupuncture Point, and the instability it brought to his foundation was indeed considerable. It had taken him all this time to restabilize his foundation, and it was actually still some time before he was ready to break through the seventeenth Death Acupuncture Point safely.\n However, at this moment, he still made the decision to do so without hesitation.\n Due to the pressure from the two bloodline powers, his energy whirlpools had already been circulating to the max, at least twice faster than normal. By withdrawing them so swiftly would cause the void to be quickly filled by the spinning energy whirlpools in a sudden burst towards the ShenQue Acupuncture Point.\n The ShenQue Acupuncture Point was the fourth Death Acupuncture Point of the Third Portion of the Immortal Deity Technique, the seventeenth overall. In that instant, with such a crazed movement, the rapid moving Heavenly Energy was actually further accelerated by the pressure from the bloodline powers, and despite his overall Heavenly Energy being insufficient for such a purpose, it was still able to forcibly charge into the ShenQue Acupuncture Point.\n Zhou Weiqing was extremely clear that as soon as he broke the Death Acupuncture Point, his body would be like an inflated balloon punctured. At that point, all the energy in his body would rush towards that broken Death Acupuncture Point, including the two bloodline powers. The most likely result of his action would be the two bloodline powers surging out of his body, causing him to explode and die. However, Zhou Weiqing was also confident that before that happened, he would be able to regain his ability to move, and give him the chance to save Shangguan Fei’er.\n In order to prevent Shangguan Fei’er from dying right at his side, he was pitting his entire life in this one crazy move. He did not have any choice. No matter what, he would not let her die for him. Otherwise, even if he survived, he would never be able to forgive himself.\n *Poof**Poof* In that miraculous instant, the ShenQue Death Acupuncture Point was actually broken through. Zhou Weiqing instantly felt all his energy swirling about within him. To his surprise, as the energy surged of him speedily, it actually gave him a comfortable sensation, relieving him of the torturous pain.\n Alas, another problem arose. Although he had successfully broken through the ShenQue Acupuncture Point, things did not proceed as per his expectations. The surging of the bloodline powers did not cause him to regain control of his body.\n His body remained still, unmoving, and no matter how hard he tried he could not control it. The two bloodline powers surged towards the ShenQue Acupuncture Point, and this time they had stopped fighting, instead both rushing to repair the hole in the ShenQue Acupuncture Point.\n In that instant, inspiration struck Zhou Weiqing, and he suddenly understood that he had somehow stumbled onto a way to resolve the danger.\n In fact, it all seemed to simple once one thought through it, yet no one would have ever thought of such a solution directly. The two bloodline powers within his body was the extreme heat of the Solidified Dragon Spirit and the overbearing cold of the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodlines respectively. Both could be said to be totally opposite, and at the maximum of their representative. If they continued clashing and fighting like that, Zhou Weiqing would definitely die, no matter if Shangguan Fei’er sacrificed herself for him. That was because these two powers had just no possibility of merging like that, with only emnity for each other. This was a fight to the death.\n However, this time, Zhou Weiqing’s action to break the cauldrons and sink boats [3. Literal translation of a chinese idiom. Basically to cut off all means of retreat for yourself, to fight with a rope around one\u0027s neck] in using his Heavenly Energy to breakthrough his Seventeenth Death Acupuncture Point, the ShenQue Acupuncture Point. At that point, his Heavenly Energy and life force were all gushing out of him. This forced the two bloodline powers, who would not give in to each other, to finally have a common ground. That was, a subconscious instinct to protect Zhou Weiqing.\n Without question, once Zhou Weiqing broke through his Death Acupuncture Point, both the Solidified Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline powers would protect him and aid him in completing the energy whirlpool. Previously, the Solidified Dragon Spirit was not able to do this, but having absorbed all the power of the Green Gold Flame, it was now able to do so.\n As such, once the ShenQue Acupuncture Point was broken through, the two bloodline powers managed to find a common ground, a point of truce.\n Surrounding the ShenQue Acupuncture Point, the two bloodline powers pulsed rhythmically as they got to work. At this point, their only goal was to protect Zhou Weiqing, and not to clash against the other.\n As the energy whirlpool of the seventeenth Death Acupuncture Point slowly formed, the two bloodline powers gradually slowed and stabilized. The Solidified Dragon Spirit returned to its original position beneath his skin, while the Dark Demon God Tiger subsided deep within Zhou Weiqing’s body once more. The danger had been resolved.\n To Zhou Weiqing, this could be said to be gaining unexpectedly from misfortune. Not only did he survive, he had actually broken through to the next cultivation stage.\n However, at this point, Zhou Weiqing could not feel any excitement or happiness. He still remained unable to move, unable to save Shangguan Fei’er.\n Finally, almost after another fifteen minutes, the energy within his body subsided and resumed its normal status, his Heavenly Energy back to its maximum. He also regained control of his body, able to move once more.\n Abruptly, Zhou Weiqing flipped himself over into a sitting position, holding Shangguan Fei’er tight in his embrace.\n The next instant, he was sent into shock.\n Shangguan Fei’er lay there silently in his arms. The mischievous, lively young Second Miss of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was just so uncharacteristically quiet.\n Her beautiful face was pale, devoid of colour. Even her normally luscious lips were almost white, the only colour being the slight stains of blood on them. Due to the sheer intense pain, her teeth had bitten down hard on her lips.\n Two red lines, tracing a straight path down from her eyes. A ghastly sight that stuck like a knife right to his heart. Blood tears. Her entire body was naked, but emitting a grey white aura … lifeless…\n There was no heartbeat. Not a shred of spirit or soul. Yes, she was dead, devoid of all signs of life.\n In order to save Zhou Weiqing, she had sent all all of her Heavenly Energy into Zhou Weiqing’s body, abandoning her own defenses totally. With the two raging bloodline powers, her body was totally open to their hot and cold mix of energies.\n However, there was no regret on her face, a peaceful, almost satisfied expression… as if death was the right path she had chosen.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-16-chapter-131-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
