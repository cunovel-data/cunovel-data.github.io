After all, father hitting son was a universally accepted principle [1. Basically in China, especially in the olden days, filial piety is one of the most important values. You can read up about it in Confucianism as well]. However, this time, he knew it was a misunderstanding and accepting the beating would be unjust; naturally he wasn’t that silly.\n “You still dare to run? Ehh?” Although Admiral Zhou’s strike just now was from a fit of anger, but his son’s speed still gave him a surprise. In his heart, he thought: Could it be, that little brat was telling the truth?\n “Dad, you’re a Mid level Zong Master, don’t tell me you can’t even recognize an Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel!” Zhou Weiqing yelled out indignantly. As he did so, he raised his right hand and circulated his Heavenly Energy, and in an icy mist, the Overlord Bow appeared in his grasp. Actions speak louder than words, and he did not want to waste time; the Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment would tell his tale for him.\n As soon as the Overlord Bow appeared, an imposing aura filled the tent, and the thick fluctuations of a Strength Physical Jewel instantly drew Admiral Zhou’s attention.\n Admiral Zhou stared blankly at the Overlord Bow in his son’s hand, and his next action was so sudden and strange that it caused both Zhou Weiqing and Xiao Ru Se to not know whether to laugh or cry. The distinguished Admiral actually lifted both his hands, and rubbed at his eyes.\n “Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment?”\n Zhou Weiqing was afraid his dad would hit him again, and quickly said: “Yes! That’s my first Physical Jewel’s Consolidated Equipment, it’s called the Overlord Bow, has an attack range of over 1.5km, and has an additional explosive effect added on. Furthermore, it also has an socket for an Elemental Jewel in order to make use of fusion skills.\n Admiral Zhou’s body trembled and swayed a bit, as he took a step back; his breathing obviously a lot heavier than before. “Weiqing, use your strongest skill and shoot an arrow at me.”\n As an archer, naturally Zhou Weiqing had arrows with him, but for him to shoot his own father, he did not dare do so. “Dad… that…”\n “Don’t waste time, use your full strength or I’ll beat you up!” Admiral Zhou recovered from his short bout of dazed shock and disbelief, and his eyes shone with an unrestrained excitement and glee.\n Zhou Weiqing was very familiar with his father’s temper, and knew he would do as he said. As such, he didn’t argue further and quietened down to focus. As he whipped out an arrow and nocked it onto the Overlord Bow’s bowstring, his shoulders tensed as he drew the bow to its full crescent shape. With a quick thought, the Elemental Jewel on his left wrist quietly fell into the socket on the Overlord Bow. After all, Admiral Zhou was his father, although he had been told to use his strongest skill, but his attribute wheel moved to the black, Darkness Attribute area, instead of the highest damage blue, Lightning area.\n Currently, Zhou Weiqing was around 10 metres away from his father, and at the instant that he drew the Overlord Bow, Admiral Zhou showed some surprised on his face. With his cultivation level, he could clearly feel how much Heavenly Energy that Overlord Bow was holding currently.\n “Dad, be careful!” After he said that, Zhou Weiqing released the bowstring.\n The severe whistling sound of the arrow and the final explosion rang out almost simultaneously, and before anyone could see the arrow, in the next instant, a black arrow appeared right in front of Admiral Zhou.\n Zhou Weiqing’s jaw dropped as he stared at the sight before him. The arrow that he had shot out with his Overlord Bow was just hovering there right in front of his father, and he had not even seen or felt what skill had been used.\n *Bang* Another soft explosion sounded out, and the arrow disintegrated into dust. The Touch of Darkness skill activated and 12 black tentacles of about half a metre flickered for a second, before vanishing as well. From the look, it was as if a small octopus flailed around at Admiral Zhou for a while before disappearing.\n Zhou Weiqing was very clear how strong the Overlord Bow’s destructive power was, and for that arrow, he had indeed used his full strength. Unexpectedly, his father had stopped it so easily without even releasing his Heavenly Jewels. He had never really seen his father’s real strength, and only now did he realise how terrifying a mid level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master was.\n Xiao Ru Se had been standing at the side, and could see things relatively clearer. Faintly, she had seen that when Zhou Weiqing released his arrow, Admiral Zhou had blown out a breath of air.\n Zhou Weiqing was stunned, but at the other side, Admiral Zhou was just as stunned. Of course, with the huge difference in cultivation level, how could Zhou Weiqing possibly injure him? However, feeling the power of that arrow, he had also gotten a good estimation of his son’s strength.\n “Ru Se, please leave first, I have to talk to this little brat alone.” Admiral Zhou said passively.\n “Yes sir.” Xiao Ru Se agreed respectfully, before turning around to leave.\n Admiral Zhou’s face seemed as calm as water, and in a flash, he appeared next to Zhou Weiqing, grabbing his shoulders. In another flash, the surroundings blurred around Zhou Weiqing as he lost sight of everything, only feeling a strong wind blowing past him. As he was also a Heavenly Jewel Master now, he could naturally sense that his father was not using his Heavenly Jewels, and this insane speed was totally with Heavenly Energy alone. Such speed was as if he was flying at low altitudes; this was the power of a 8-Jewelled Mid level Zong stage Heavenly Jewel Master!\n After about 15 minutes, Admiral Zhou finally stopped, and Zhou Weiqing saw that his father had brought him to a small hillside.\n Admiral Zhou put his son on the ground, and suddenly put his hands to his waist: “Wahahaha! £$%^\u0026*\u0026^%$£\"\"£$%^\u0026! My son is no longer a trash! Wahahaha!!!”\n Admiral Zhou’s boisterous laughter almost startled Zhou Weiqing into falling off the cliff. In his memory, he had never seen his black-faced father so happy before.\n Admiral laughed out loud for nearly the time it took to finish a meal [2. that’s the literal translation, another phrase that totally sounds weird when you do it in English. Just take it as ‘a while’. Do you guys prefer if I leave the literal translation or sanitize it for english readers?] before he finally stopped. However, when he looked at Zhou Weiqing once again, he resumed his usual strict face.\n “Little brat, tell me how you became a Heavenly Jewel Master. Don’t miss out any detail.” [3. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]\n Zhou Weiqing said tentatively: “Dad, my Awakening process is a bit… weird. If I did anything wrong… can you not beat me up?”\n Admiral Zhou gave him a hmph and said: “Alright, I won’t hit you. You’re already a Heavenly Jewel Master yourself, at least Your Father, I, will not have to keep worrying about your future! Why would I beat you up then! Do you think I enjoy beating you? My heart aches when I do so as well! Hmph. If not for the fact I’m afraid that you, this little brat, will die easily from not having enough to eat if I pass away, do you think I have so much time to beat my own son everyday?”\n Although his father’s tone was still brash and cold, but listening to his words, Zhou Weiqing felt a warmth in his heart. Indeed! No matter how much Dad hits me, he is still my father!\n Humans, when they get excited, it is easy for them to blurt out the truth. Zhou Weiqing showed that trait right at this moment. “Dad, I did it with Shangguan Bing’er.” [4. Lol, clear explanation indeed \u003dp ]\n “Do it then do it… what’s that got to do with your Heavenly Jewel Awakening?” At this point, Admiral Zhou was still extremely excited, but before his words ended, he suddenly realised what was being said, and grabbed the front of Zhou Weiqing’s leather armor, scaring the little white tiger into shrinking its head back down again. “What did you say? You did what?”\n Zhou Weiqing gave a foolish grin and said: “Heh … that …” As such, he started his tale from him getting the black pearl, running away and told everything to his father.\n Even though Admiral Zhou was a Mid Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, listening to his son’s experiences this past few months caused his expression to change many times. Of which, the greatest change was when Zhou Weiqing described his Awakening with Shangguan Bing’er as a sacrifice, and when he had taken Huyan Aobo as his teacher.\n Zhou Weiqing spoke for almost an entire hour before he finished detailing his experiences of the past month, and he also passed his father the Immortal Deity Technique manual.\n Flipping open the Immortal Deity Technique, Admiral Zhou’s face changed as soon as he read a few lines. Almost involuntarily, his hand raised up as if to hit Zhou Weiqing again, but he stopped himself halfway.\n “Dad, you must keep your word, you said you wouldn’t hit me just now.” Zhou Weiqing said pitiably at his father.\n Admiral Zhou threw the Immortal Deity Technique onto him, and Zhou Weiqing quickly kept it again.\n Admiral Zhou said in a serious voice: “That is to say… you, this little brt, ate some strange black pearl, and cultivated this nonsensical Immortal Deity Technique, causing the Evil aura within the pearl to activate; followed by which you took advantage of Shangguan Bing’er as a sacrifice to Awaken your Heavenly Jewels? And Bing’er didn’t kill you little bastard?”\n Zhou Weiqing thought snidely to himself: Dad, if you call me a little bastard, doesn’t that mean that you...\n “Uhh… Yes that’s right.”\n Admiral Zhou’s furrowed brow relaxed a little, and he gave a small sigh before saying: “Bing’er is just too good a girl! Sigh… you better treat her well and take good care of her. From now on, she’s our Zhou Family daughter-in-law. Hmph. Aren’t you very good at acting, and learnt a whole bunch of rascally tricks? I don’t care what you do, but you better bring her back home soon. However, you better remember that you can’t force her, and she better be willing to come with you!”\n Zhou Weiqing blinked in surprise, feeling joy pervade him and he said excitedly: “Dad, does that mean you are okay with me and Shangguan Bing’er?”\n Admiral Zhou gave another hmph and said: “You have gotten the advantage this time little brat. As for Huyan Aobo, when you are 16, you should really work hard and learn how to create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. You should understand how important a Consolidating Equipment Master is for our Heavenly Bow Empire. Alright, get lost now, you can head west to return to the camp, and when you do so, start packing up as well. Tomorrow, you will join Bing’er and report to the Heavenly Bow Unit.\n Zhou Weiqing started a little; he did not expect that his father would be so easy going after knowing about him and Shangguan Bing’er, as he had expected a beating.\n Once again asking tentatively, he said: “Dad, is that it? Aren’t you going to ask me to cultivate harder?”\n A strange light flashed in Admiral Zhou’s eyes, and he said exasperatedly: “Urge? How could I rush you. That nonsensical Immortal Deity Technique, how can it be rushed? You little brat, you better remember, if you dare to die before Your Father, I will turn myself into a ghost and break your legs. Now, get lost!”\n Zhou Weiqing saw that his father was near bursting point again, and didn’t stop to continue talking and ran off.\n Looking at his son’s retreating figure, Admiral Zhou suddenly burst out laughing again, muttering to himself at the same time: “Hmph, who still dares say that my son is a trash, haha, he’s a genius amongst all genius! Bing’er that little girl is extremely good, with her restricting that little brat, that’ll be more than enough! Heh, that brat still wants me to teach him, what’s there to teach! My 8th Jewel’s Skill was the Touch of Darkness, that little brat… Wahahaha!”\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-5-chapter-25-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
