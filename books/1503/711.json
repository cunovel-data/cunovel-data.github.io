(1) Regardless as to whether or not he made any mistakes in terms of process or procedure, his Saint Energy ensured that the precious materials fully obeyed his will. This made fusing them together as one much simpler. A faint smile appeared on Zhou Weiqing’s face as he looked at the faintly flickering light emanating from the Consolidating Ink within the crystal vat. He had at least finished the first step, and everything had been more or less what he had expected. He didn’t continue with the creation process. If he did, his behavior would be too different from what a five-Jeweled cultivator like he appeared to be could accomplish. He instead sat down into a cross-legged position, beginning to gather his vitality. He had to at least give those two the false impression that he needed to recover his Heavenly Energy. The two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters were rather puzzled. Why didn’t Zhou Weiqing first put away that precious Consolidating Ink? It must be remembered that the more precious a Consolidating Ink was, the quicker it would evaporate. Thus, after creating Consolidating Liquid, they would usually put it into a sealed bottle right away to preserve it. A short while later, they let out amazed sighs. This was because the silver Consolidating Ink which only took up a small fraction of the space inside the basin didn’t appear to be evaporating at all. The rays of the sun were shining down upon it through the windows, but the dazzling astral luster of the ink didn’t change in the slightest. How was it this stable? The two exchanged a glance, nodding at each other. Even if Zhou Weiqing wasn’t an actually God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, for him to be able to do this much meant that he had already passed the XuanTian Palace’s test. Without question, he was an absolute genius of the Consolidating Equipment world. The XuanTian Palace, at least, had never been able to produce such a tremendously talented figure before! In the faint, flickering light, Zhou Weiqing spent nearly an hour recuperating. He then finally rose to his feet, and as he did so he once more entered the ‘one with the world’ status. He had yet to say a single word since he had begun, but the two watching God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters felt as though they were mentally spent. This was because they didn’t dare to be the slightest bit negligent in watching Zhou Weiqing’s every movement. Even masters like themselves had to constantly learn and improve. A God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master who was capable of creating a nine-piece set was on a completely different level from one who was only able to create an eight-piece set. As for one who was able to create a ten-piece Legendary Set? That represented one which had reached the ranks of legends even amongst the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters. As for eleven-piece sets? It had been a long, long time since anyone on the XuanTian Continent had ever been able to produce such a thing. When Zhou Weiqing once more rose to his feet, he readjusted the crystal vat before him. The two carefully memorized even the slightest of motions he made. He took a deep breath, a focused look once more appearing in his eyes. He waved his hand, causing the highest-quality piece of Consolidating Paper to appear atop the yellow rosewood table in front of him. This table was extremely flat, and it was almost as slick as a mirror. The Consolidating Paper completely stuck onto the surface. Every single sheaf of Consolidating Paper of this quality was worth above a hundred gold coins, and even then it couldn’t be found for purchase. This was because in order to create it, more than ten different types of precious Spatial Attribute materials had to be consumed. Not even God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters would use such precious materials until they were completely certain that they would succeed, as there was no place to buy them! Zhou Weiqing flipped his hand over, producing a Consolidating Pen that glowed with dazzling silver light. When they saw this pen appear, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters could no longer restrain themselves and immediately rose to their feet. The Consolidating Pen in Zhou Weiqing’s hand was a bit over one foot in length, and it tapered off into an extremely slender tip. It was completely silver in color, and its tip seemed to be a single whole that was one with the shaft. As soon as he had produced the pen, it had instantly emanated a thick Spatial Attribute aura that was highly condensed and focused around the tip of the pen. Cream of the crop! This was definitely a treasure amongst treasures. As God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters, these two were both Heavenly Kings and could clearly see the ancient-looking characters on the silver pen which spelled out the phrase, ‘Legacy of Strength.” So this Legacy of Strength actually existed? They had no idea that it had been Duan Tianlang who had gifted this pen to Zhou Weiqing. It had been Duan Tianlang’s most beloved treasure for many years. There had only been three such pens in the entire history of the Legacy of Strength. Zhou Weiqing currently had one, the second had gone missing, while the third was still in Duan Tianlang’s possession. This Consolidating Pen had been created from the bones of a Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Beast of the Spatial Attribute, with the tip having been created from the crushed bones of that beast. That type of Heavenly Beast had long ago gone extinct in the Boundless Mainland, while the people of the XuanTian Continent had never even heard of such a creature. This sort of Consolidating Pen could definitely be described as a priceless divine artifact to the Consolidating Equipment world. The yellow rosewood table in front of Zhou Weiqing paled in comparison to it. A flicker of greed instantly appeared in the eyes of the elder God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, while the woman next to him cast him a reflexive glare. Only then did the old man manage to extricate himself from his greed for that pen, a feeling of awe replacing it. It must be remembered that for someone like him, there was virtually nothing which he could not acquire in the XuanTian Continent. It had been countless years since he had even felt the emotion of ‘greed’. Faint light flickered in front of Zhou Weiqing, whose face was covered with a faint smile. He held onto the shaft of the Consolidating Pen using his right hand, once more closing his eyes. The two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters couldn’t help but stare wide-eyed at him again. There were three critical steps in creating a Consolidating Scroll. The first was the creation of the Consolidating Ink, which could involve many different mysterious formulas. Every single God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master had his own secret legacy and formulas which he would never pass down to outsiders, only people in his own direct line of descent. The second step lay in designing the scroll. A powerful God Tier Consolidating Scroll was extremely complicated to design, and not the slightest mistake could occur. As for the final step, called ‘sketching’, involved the actual creation of the entire scroll. Not a single mistake could be made in any of these three steps, as a mistake would immediately invalidate all the previous work. Of these three steps, the most important step of all lay in the ‘design’ portion in the second step. So long as you had a working design, any talented Consolidating Equipment Master would be able to use it to calculate and allocate the materials needed for the Consolidating Ink. The most difficult step, ‘sketching’, was actually the least important as it merely tested the Consolidating Equipment Master’s power and the degree of his control. For Consolidating Equipment Masters, any design diagram for a Consolidating Scroll created by a different God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master was a priceless treasure. When they saw that Zhou Weiqing was about to design his diagram, how could they give up such a wonderful opportunity? This time, Zhou Weiqing kept his eyes closed for much longer than the previous two times. He simply stood there, maintaining a perfectly firm and stable grip over the Consolidating Pen. He didn’t budge at all for the time needed to burn half a stick of incense. Just as the two were beginning to feel rather impatient, Zhou Weiqing suddenly took a deep breath. As he did so, he seemed to have transformed into an enormous vortex which began to gather all of the energy of the world into his body. The Personal Jewels in his hands began to light up. Although he was still just a five-Jeweled cultivator, in that instant his aura suddenly began to skyrocket. The two naturally had no idea why Zhou Weiqing had chosen to suddenly increase his power at a time like this, but they didn’t dare to disturb him in the slightest even though they were a bit curious. One had to be fully focused and detail-oriented when designing a scroll. If this was a scroll which he had already designed and used long ago, by all rights this should be the quickest of the three steps… but why did it look like he was pouring all of his power into it? And he even seemed to be using some sort of secret technique that temporarily raised his Heavenly Energy to a level which vastly surpassed his actual cultivation level. They had no idea that Zhou Weiqing was doing all this just to put on a show for them. They watched, completely stunned, as Zhou Weiqing suddenly dipped his Consolidating Pen deep into the crystal basin, staining its tip with the silver starry Consolidating Ink. W-what was he doing?! The two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters were completely stunned. There was no way someone would use Consolidating Ink to simply design a scroll. W-was he actually going to skip the ‘design’ stage and go straight into creating the scroll itself? B-but this was impossible! Although these two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master were completely confident in their techniques for creating Consolidating Scrolls they had never before created a God Tier Consolidating Scroll without even going through the design phase. They had this kind of ability, but they would only use it for creating ordinary Consolidating Scrolls. The materials needed for creating God Tier Consolidating Scrolls were simply too precious. If you didn’t use a design diagram, your chances of failure would skyrocket. No talented God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master would take such a foolish risk… but the youth before them clearly was about to. Zhou Weiqing’s left wrist trembled, splashing the ink from his pen across the surface of the paper before him. The silver ink instantly began to form a sketch. His movements were very slow, but his fingers and his wrist were extremely stable. All of his feelings and emotions seemed to have vanished as he became one with the Consolidating Pen he held as well as the Consolidating Paper he was sketching on. He’s insane. He’s completely insane! The two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters exchanged a glance. Finally, they had been completely and thoroughly stunned by Zhou Weiqing. Dense streams of silver light began to spill out of Zhou Weiqing’s body. This was the Spatial Attribute Heavenly Energy which he had converted. The silver light flowed down his arm, pooling together within the Consolidating Pen within the palm of his hand before coming together with the Consolidating Ink at the tip of the pen as it continued to slowly sketch. Now was the time for the yellow rosewood and the godlike Consolidating Pen within Zhou Weiqing’s hands to reveal their importance. The Consolidating Paper was kept extremely steady by the yellow rosewood table, while the Consolidating Liquid which was sketched onto the paper would completely bond together with the paper in an extremely short amount of time. Zhou Weiqing’s cadence didn’t change at all, as though he had already found his own rhythm.
