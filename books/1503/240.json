Despite that, she had a faint smile on her face, and she seemed so at peace, as if nothing could make her flustered.\\n\\n “Do not judge their entire team so quickly. Furthermore, these two three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters of theirs are rather interesting… one with some impressive physical strength, the other with superb archery. More importantly, he is very clever. Also, they definitely will not be the only four sent by the Fei Li Empire. The tournament has just begun, and nothing is set in stone yet. Alas, in this preliminary fight, we will be unable to see ZhongTian, BaoPo and WanShou Battle Teams’ fights. This year, we cannot place fourth any longer!”\\n\\n When the ashen faced youth heard the young lady speak, a look of respect crossed his face as he said: “Leader, you’re right. From what we see so far, when we get first in the group, after the top eight, during the top four we might meet the WanShou Battle Team.”\\n\\n The young lady furrowed her brow as she said: “WanShou Battle Team… they are indeed a problem.”\\n\\n Having passed the first round smoothly, Zhou Weiqing and team were extremely happy. No matter what, they had earned three days of rest for Lin TianAo and the other injured members. Their second round would also be a relatively weak from a small Empire, but the critical moment would be the third round when they had to fight with the Bai Da Battle Team. As for the seeded team, DanDun Empire, would be their last fight. That was decent luck, but not great; if they could meet the Bai Da Battle Team on the last fight, then Lin TianAo and the other injured members would have time to fully recover. Still, it was good enough, at least they did not have to meet them in the first round.\\n\\n “Come on, let’s head back and tell leader and the rest the good news.” Zhou Weiqing stretched lazily as he said.\\n\\n Ye Paopao said: “Don’t we want to see the other teams? Especially the Bai Da Empire.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “No, let’s not. If we watch, we will be misled easily. After all, just like ourselves, the Bai Da Battle Team will be treating us as their main opponent, and they will also hold many things back during this fight. We might as well not watch, and when our fight comes, we shall just fight to our best abilities. Furthermore, there is another round three days later for us to watch. Since we scarcely have the opportunity to come to this ZhongTian City, I’m going to walk around with Bing’er, we need to strike a proper balance between work and leisure after all, heh heh. If you guys do not want to walk around, then you can head back to the inn to let leader know about the news.”\\n\\n Ye Paopao couldn’t help but chuckle, saying: “I’ve never seen anyone as carefree as you. Alright, you two go ahead and enjoy, I will head back to report to leader. Crow, how about you?”\\n\\n Crow grinned and said: “Yesterday, we saw so much good food near the inn, I want to go and enjoy myself, I feel like I have lost weight recently. Sigh… when can my weight go above a thousand jin!”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing and the rest stared at her helplessly. A thousand jin… are these Gold Crow Tribe members really human??\\n\\n By now, another fight had started on the stage, but many of the teams still noticed the four members of the Fei Li Battle Team leaving. Although everyone was free to go after their own fight was over, but most, if not all, of the other teams would stay to watch the other fights. As the saying goes, ‘Only by knowing one\u0027s own strength and the enemy\u0027s strength, can there be a sure way to victory’, the Fei Li Battle Team was definitely the only one who left the plaza.\\n\\n However, at this point, nobody really felt that they were being arrogant any longer. Although they had won their previous match, but the power they displayed wasn’t overbearing, and they had even lost a fight. In most of their eyes, the victory earlier had some overtones of luck, perhaps even a large proportion. Especially for the last fight of Zhou Weiqing versus Little Worm, with Zhou Weiqing barely winning by exhausting his opponent’s Heavenly Energy. As such, them leaving just sealed the impression in most of the team’s minds that the Fei Li Battle Team members were just out of their minds, and no one had a good outlook on them. Even the other weaker teams in their groups were rubbing their hands in glee internally, thinking they had a chance to beat them. As for the Bai Da Battle Team, they were even more delighted, their confidence bursting at the seams, a cold smirk on their faces as they watched the four members of the Fei Li Battle Team walking away.\\n\\n Leaving via the tunnel for participants, they exited the plaza before separating. Ye Paopao and Crow headed back towards the inn together, while Zhou Weiqing held onto Shangguan Bing’er’s little hand before walking onto the street.\\n\\n The usual bustling streets of the ZhongTian City were a lot quieter than normal, as most of the population of the inner city had went to watch the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, naturally causing the amount of pedestrians to be reduced drastically.\\n\\n Holding on to Shangguan Bing\u0027er’s soft warm little hand, he led them aimlessly for a bit before finally stopping a passerby to ask: “Big bro, could you please tell me where I can find the area to purchase Consolidating Equipment Scrolls or the materials for Consolidating Equipment Scrolls?” As the largest city in the entire mainland, Zhou Weiqing expected it to have quite an impressive selection of materials and scrolls. Although he was not lacking in materials currently, he still wanted to visit and experience the sights for himself, and perhaps collect some rare materials if possible. After all, he wanted to make this rare trip worth his while.\\n\\n The passerby looked rather strangely at Zhou Weiqing and said: “Little bro, you two are definitely not our ZhongTian Empire citizens right?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing asked curiously: “Yes, how did you know that?”\\n\\n The passerby said laughingly: “If you were a ZhongTian citizen, you wouldn’t have asked that question. Our ZhongTian Empire has our Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, and everything to do with Consolidating Equipment Scrolls can be found there. Its status for Consolidating Equipment is akin to the Skill Storing Palace for Skill Storing. Of course, this is only for our ZhongTian Empire, no other empire has the power to do so. If you want to go to the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, just follow this road down all the way until you reach the third right crossing, then follow that down a short distance. It is the largest building in sight from there.”\\n\\n After saying that, the passerby left, leaving the rather stunned Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er.\\n\\n Consolidating Equipment Pavilion? In this ZhongTian Empire, there actually was a specific place to buy and sell Consolidating Equipment Scrolls and materials! In other countries, to buy Consolidating Equipment Scrolls was not a matter of having money, but rather a lack of supply… what kind of power did this empire have? [1. Not sure if I phrased this correctly, as the Fei Li Empire has the Trading Centre for Heavenly Jewel Masters, which has shops selling materials etc. However, this is very different - an entire government organization, like that Skill Storing Palace of Consolidating Equipments, thus a whole different ballgame.]\\n\\n More importantly, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er could deeply sense the sheer pride of that passerby. Pride for his empire, in his empire, and in being a citizen! That was just a normal citizen, not a Jewel Master… the strength of the empire had given even an ordinary citizen such pride, the ability to hold their head up high!\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er could feel Zhou Weiqing’s grip around her hand tighten slightly, as he said softly: “One day, in my lifetime, I will definitely make our Heavenly Bow Empire citizens proud, just like that.”\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er pulled his hand up, placing it on her face, saying gently: “I believe that my Little Fatty will definitely be able to do that.”\\n\\n Following the passerby’s directions, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er quickly found the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion.\\n\\n Just like the passerby had said, the Pavilion was the largest building on the entire street, equal on sight to the Fei Li Empire’s Skill Storing Palace, needing to ascend nearly thirty large steps before reaching the huge, ancient styled building. The Pavilion had six levels, with elaborate carvings decorating it [2. The phrase is actually referring to a specific building style from the ancient times - http://baike.baidu.com/view/128708.htm], glowing in the sun like they were treasures, and could be said to be one of the top architectures of the world.\\n\\n There were guards in the front of the door, requiring all visitors to register and be issued with an identity plaque before entering, although that did not require any fees. In that, it was much kinder than the Fei Li Trading Center.\\n\\n Upon entering, the ancient beauty of the wide hall struck them, simple and tasteful yet full of beauty. It did not seem to be a place for buying and selling, but more like a grand library. Zhou Weiqing examined the wood of the ornaments, and was surprised to see that not only were the ornaments made of the same wood, the pillars and even walls were also… More importantly, the wood was extremely familiar to him, the extremely rare Stars Wood that was only produced in the Heavenly Bow Empire!\\n\\n In the Heavenly Bow Empire, it was considered a valuable strategic material, reserved for crafting bows and arrows. Yet, here, it was merely a building material.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er had clearly also discovered the same thing, and was equally surprised. Just as the two of them were staring in shock, a tall youth dressed in white robes walked up to them, bowing slightly before saying: “Hello honoured customers, what are you looking for? I am a guide in the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, and I can introduce you and bring you to what you require.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “I wish to purchase some materials for Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, may I know where I can find them?”\\n\\n The white robed youth said politely: “Sir, this is your first time in our Consolidating Equipment Pavilion right? Let me give you a quick introduction. There are six levels in total for our Pavilion. The sixth level is our auction level, and an auction is held every week. As for the other levels, they are all selling Consolidating Equipment Scrolls or materials. Each level is separated into five zones, respectively selling Consolidating Paper, Consolidating Ink Materials, Completed Consolidating Ink, Completed Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, and advice or counsel with Consolidating Equipment Masters. All five levels are the same in that regard, with each level having different limits, naturally the higher the level, the higher level the items sold.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but praise admiringly in his heart as he asked the youth: “Alright, for us, what level are we able to ascend to?”\\n\\n The white robed youth said: “Currently, both of you may only shop at the first level. Only after spending more than a million gold coins can you enter the second level, the third level would be ten million gold coins.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing was dumbfounded. “So much? Is there any preferential treatment?”\\n\\n The white robed youth continued: “Of course there is. If both of you are Heavenly Jewel Masters or Consolidating Equipment Masters and join our Empire’s Skill Storing Palace or Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, you can enter the first three levels without any limits.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing sighed inwardly. It was clear that the more powerful the Empire, the greater and wiser their methods of drawing powerhouses to join them. Of course, they had the resources, ability, and power to do so!\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er asked curiously: “What about the fourth and fifth level? Who can enter?”\\n\\n The youth smiled faintly and said: “The fourth level and fifth level are the VIP areas, and the requirements for entry are a lot more stringent. Only members of our Empire’s Skill Storing Palace or Consolidating Equipment Palace are able to ascend to the fourth level, and they must be Heavenly Jewel Masters of at least Lower Level Zong Stage and above, otherwise no matter how much spent, you will still not be able to enter the fourth level. As for the fifth, it is even more stringent, with only Higher Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters and above being able to enter, with the addition of having contributed significantly to the empire, and with two current level five VIP guests to introduce you.”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-9-chapter-74-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
