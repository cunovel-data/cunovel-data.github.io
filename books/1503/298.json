This was all due to a massive gap in power levels. As such, even though he didn’t know how long he had to wait for Bing’er, perhaps only a short amount of time, Zhou Weiqing did not want to waste any of it, and he sat there cultivating. In the previous fight against the Dan Dun Battle Team, he had Devoured some of Shen Little Demon’s Heavenly Energy, then once more some of Lin TianAo’s Heavenly Energy when he was being healed, and then Shen Little Demon’s once again when he healed her. That had given him a huge overall boost to his Heavenly Energy, but it was very mixed and impure. As such, these few days, he had been refining and purifying this external Heavenly Energy and making it his own. The Demonic Manual that Little Witch had lent him had given him a whole new insight to the Demonic Attribute, and more so the Devour Skill, and had also given him a new target for his future cultivation. The Devour Skill was indeed a great skill in combat, but its true benefits actually lay out of combat, in supporting his cultivating, enabling him to Devour other humans or even Heavenly Beasts’ Heavenly Energy for his own use. Once that Devoured Heavenly Energy was cleansed and purified for his own use, it would truly belong to him. Of course, by that time, less than ten percent would be left, and he would still need constantly purify and meld it to make it his own, a rather tedious process. This would restrict those Heavenly Demon Jewel Masters from using this Skill to gain a terrifying amount of power in a short amount of time. Yet, even with all those restrictions, any Heavenly Jewel Master with the Devour Skill cultivated at speeds far beyond that of any ordinary talented Heavenly Jewel Master. Of course that was provided he or she had sufficient Heavenly Beasts or other Heavenly Jewel Masters to constantly Devour from. Earlier, he had gone through all the levels of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion and looked through the materials, and after thinking about it, he knew that he just had too many things he wanted to purchase. Still, he would not rush into it. After all, his finances were limited. His plan was to wait until after the Heavenly Jewel Tournament before starting his purchases. If they could get a decent ranking position in the Tournament, he would be able to make use of a better discount to purchase more materials. At the same time, he had a new focus for his cultivation after today, with the Skill Storing Palace being the best place for him to train. That was because there were more than enough Heavenly Beasts for him to Devour there. As long as he was extremely careful in keeping it hidden, he should be safe from being discovered. As he continued cultivating, he continued making his plans, deep in thought. In such a state, time passed by swiftly, and it was like a blink of an eye and evening had already come. “Little Fatty.” A soft voice roused Zhou Weiqing from his cultivation, and his eyes snapped wide open instantly to see the beautiful face of Shangguan Bing’er in front of him, tears in her eyes. Zhou Weiqing leaped up to his feet, grabbing her hands as he pulled her into an embrace. Currently, she looked extremely exhausted, but the excitement in her eyes at their meeting was not diminished at all. Shangguan Xue’er stood beside Shangguan Bing’er, an exact look, but a totally different aura and expression, forming a different beauty altogether. Alas, Zhou Weiqing only had eyes for his Bing’er, and did not even glance at Shangguan Xue’er. “Bing’er, you should come back earlier. You will need to cultivate in order to stablize your state, so you can properly go through fresh new Consolidating.” Even though she was speaking to her own beloved sister, Shangguan Xue’er’s voice still seemed cold. Shangguan Bing’er nodded to her sister, saying: “Big Sis, I will be back before midnight.” Zhou Weiqing did not greet Shangguan Xue’er, pulling Shangguan Bing’er away out of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion and right back to the hotel where the Fei Li Battle Team were staying. He was almost half carrying Bing’er as he rushed into his room, slamming the door shut before hugging her tightly in his embrace. At this moment, it was as if their hearts beat as one, melding together like they were about to break free of their chests and join together as their bodies pressed together, and their heartbeats raced increasingly. “Little Fatty… Little Fatty…” Shangguan Bing’er muttered, as if not believing that what was happening in front of her was true, and it was all just a dream. Zhou Weiqing could feel Shangguan Bing’er’s body in his arms emitting a shocking heat, melting his body, his heart and his soul. Lowering his head, he found her lips so naturally, kissing down lightly as if afraid of hurting her. Shangguan Bing’er could clearly feel the pent up emotions, the excitement in the taut tension of his body, but yet Zhou Weiqing’s kiss was so soft and careful as his lips quivered. Lifting her arms and wrapping them around his neck, she took the initiative to deepen the kiss, inexperienced and awkwardly, but very intensely as they felt their connection deepen even further. Two fiery hot hearts, blossoming outward like fireworks in the skies, spreading into every inch of their body, that fire seeming to melt every part of them… Within that room in the inn, a spring in the air thicker than that of the Heavenly Jewel Island grew, as love and yearning intertwined in the heat. Rough, powerful pantings, and soft sweet cries rose in sudden excitement, then dropped... … As night fell, the skies darkened, and the entire Heavenly Jewel Island was covered in clouds, shimmering with a layer of soft light. Snuggling deep into Zhou Weiqing’s embrace, feeling his large hot hands lingering around her back, Shangguan Bing’er did not feel like moving at all, as if her body was like cotten candy. This was not their first time, but as compared to their first time, especially for Shangguan Bing’er, it was the difference between Heaven and Hell. This was a true joining of love, of flesh and spirit, and even she was rather shy and embarrassed about her earlier frantic excitement. Still now, in the warm afterglow, she felt that there was no distance between the two of them, as if they were part of each other now. Zhou Weiqing lowered his head, kissing her forehead and hair softly, a doting love in his eyes. How he wished that this moment could last forever! And so they spent several moments just like that, tightly embraced together, neither willing to ruin that special moment, until… “Ahhh---” Shangguan Bing’er gave a low cry of surprise, moving back a little fearfully, as she could clearly feel that ‘little monster’, that had brought her to the brinks of joy last night, yet now making her shy and scared, show signs of life once more. Zhou Weiqing quickly moved back a little as well, saying embarrassedly: “I’m sorry Bing’er, I didn’t mean to. Bing’er, you’re tired, rest a while more.” Shangguan Bing’er had been exhausted previously when she had come out of the fourth level of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, and yet both of them had spent the whole night in over-excited ‘activities’, all the way up till now. Looking at Bing’er’s, pale face, Zhou Weiqing felt an ache in his heart. “I… I don’t want to sleep, I want to talk with you a while more. Who knows when I’ll be able to see you again…” As she said that, her eyes reddened. Zhou Weiqing quickly embraced her once more, saying resolutely: “Do not cry Bing’er, I will definitely work hard and train hard, to do my utmost to become worthy of bringing you away as soon as possible.” Shangguan Bing’er put her head on his chest as she said: “Little Fatty, do not blame my father and sisters, I know they are doing everything for my good. In truth, they have already acknowledged your talent and capabilities, but father wants me to go through closed door cultivation to re-Consolidate my Physical Jewels and Elemental Jewel Skill Storing. That might require quite a long time.” Zhou Weiqing nodded, saying: “That is a good thing. You stay here and train hard then, when I have grown sufficiently to prove myself, I will come to pick you up again.” Shangguan Bing’er lifted her head to look at him, saying: “Little fool, do you really think I care about that? Actually, I wanted to leave with you no matter what, but father said that he missed mother so much, and wanted to reunite our entire family. Only if I stay in the Heavenly Jewel Island will he have the chance to bring mother back together. For both their sakes, and ours as well, that is the reason why I am staying. Since I am staying, that’s why I agreed to let father improve my power, so that when I return to the Heavenly Bow Empire to find you in the future, we can build up our Empire together. In my heart, I will always be a citizen of the Heavenly Bow Empire, and it will always be my home.” Although she wasn’t willing to sleep, Shangguan Bing’er was just too tired. In Zhou Weiqing’s comfortable embrace, even as they spoke, she unknowingly fell into a deep sleep. Zhou Weiqing stroked her hair and back tenderly, slowly circulating his Heavenly Energy carefully into her body to aid her recovery. Alas, good times always never seemed to last. When an icy cold call came from outside their door, it shook both Zhou Weiqing and the sleeping Shangguan Bing’er from their reverie. “Third sis, it’s time to go home.” The cold voice was undoubtedly Shangguan Xue’er’s. It was already long past midnight, and Bing’er had not returned. As the big sister, she had been worried, and had came to look for her. “Big sister, I\u0027m coming out, wait for me a while.” Zhou Weiqing looked on silently as the blushing Shangguan Bing’er dressed. He did not say anything, just quietly looking at her, helping her comb her hair, which had been messed up in the night. As he did so, the more Shangguan Bing’er could not bear it, and tears welled in her eyes, though she forced herself not to cry. “Little Fatty, don’t see me off alright… please?” She said pleadingly. Zhou Weiqing’s voice was rather hoarse as he said: “Let me send you to the entrance of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Every second with you is worth it.” Shangguan Bing’er shook her head, tears glittering as the motion jerked them into the air. “No! Little Fatty, if you do so, I’m afraid I will not be able to stand it. I will wait for you, no matter how long it takes, I will always wait for you. I will not go anywhere, nor will I leave the Heaven’s Expanse Palace until you come back, lest you aren’t able to find me. Alright?” Zhou Weiqing held her tightly once more. “Bing’er… Bing’er… I will not let you wait long. I promise! In three to five years, I will definitely come back to the Heavenly Jewel Island and defeat your sister, to officially marry you!” Shangguan Bing’er turned back, hugging him back with all her strength before finally releasing him, running out the door without looking back. Shangguan Xue’er was standing at the doorway, and she had naturally heard their conversation. When Shangguan Bing’er ran past her, there was a strange look in her eyes, and she turned to Zhou Weiqing and said: “Do not disappoint Bing’er.” After that, she quickly left to catch up with her sister. Zhou Weiqing stood at the door, dazed. He did not chase after them; he did not want to go against Bing’er’s last request to him. Yet, at that point, an indescribable sense of loss and intense longing overwhelmed him.
