{"id":51999,"no":825,"title":"Chapter 281 - The Sidhe Heart (1)","content":"Zhou Weiqing’s body started gradually emitting layers of terrifying energy. Upon entering the Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation state, the scales on his body slowly disappeared, and the color of his skin alternated between black and gray. His hair had also gradually become gray, and his body was releasing an indescribably powerful aura that was on the same level as a Heavenly God. However, this did not mean that Zhou Weiqing had ascended to the Heavenly God Stage, but rather, his bloodline’s aura had reached the Heavenly God Stage. As one could well imagine, if he were to reach a breakthrough, could his body still be confined to the Heavenly God Stage? It could be said that the combination of the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline, the Dragon Emperor Bloodline, coupled with the Sidhe Queen’s help, created the strongest and most powerful bloodline there had ever been. His cultivation base did not increase, but his body was intimidatingly strong to the point where even the great dragons could not be compared to him. With a soft ‘pop’ sound, Zhou Weiqing’s body released a ball of bluish green light, which got magnified almost immediately, revealing the Sidhe Queen. However, her face had become extremely pale. Suddenly, she spat out a small mouthful of blood. The Sidhe Queen had fast reflexes - she gestured with her right hand and the blood that she vomited got solidified in mid-air. Shortly after, a small bluish green bottle appeared within her palm. Under her control, the ball of blood flowed into the bottle. After everything was completed, she could not hold on any longer - her body started falling to the ground, and landed on Zhou Weiqing. Both of them fell to the ground at the same time, creating a soft thud sound. At that moment, the Sidhe Queen had lost consciousness. The secret technique that the Sidhe Queen had just performed, which was also one of the Sidhe Tribe’s most mysterious abilities, was called the Sidhe Heart. Only the sidhe of the royal bloodline would be able to execute the ability of the Sidhe Heart, once they have reached adulthood. After the Sidhe Heart was performed, it could activate the purest Life Saint Energy at the time of heaven and earth’s creation. To put it simply, in the event where the Sidhe Tribe faced the threat of extermination, as long as the Sidhe Queen executed the Sidhe Heart, the strength of all their warriors would at least increase twofold. Additionally, they would become immortal. Under such circumstances, it would be difficult to kill an ordinary sidhe, even for a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse. Hence, the Sidhe Heart could be considered as the Sidhe Tribe’s last resort in ensuring self-preservation. Generally speaking, based on the history of past generations, only the Sidhe Queen could use it. And in a Sidhe Queen’s lifetime, she could only perform the Sidhe Heart once. The current Sidhe Queen had already chosen to give her one and only chance to perform the Sidhe Heart to Zhou Weiqing. It could be said that to the Sidhe Queen, the Sidhe Heart was more important than her chastity. It was a powerful ability that concerned the entire Sidhe Tribe’s lineage. Earlier on, the Sidhe Queen could not think of any other ways to save Zhou Weiqing, except for executing that skill. Due to remorse, coupled with some changes in her mentality, she ultimately decided to use the Sidhe Heart. If a Sidhe Queen had performed the Sidhe heart, she would have to abdicate her throne within the next ten years to her successor. It could be said that even though the Sidhe Queen had severely injured Zhou Weiqing, the price she paid far outweighed what she did. Zhou Weiqing ought to be kept in the dark with regards to that. After performing the Sidhe Heart, the Sidhe Queen became extremely weak - her initially almost unlimited Life Energy had become ten times weaker. It would probably take her at least ten years to regain her vitality. However, upon completing everything, she wore a gratified smile on her face - the Sidhe Queen had no regrets. If she did not do what she did and Zhou Weiqing ended up dying, it would equally bring disaster upon the Sidhe Tribe. Furthermore, she would never have been able to forgive herself for the rest of her life. After all, her daughter had been rescued. The loss of a Sidhe Heart represented the growth of a new one. Even though the Sidhe Queen had lost her Sidhe Heart, her daughter would definitely grow more rapidly as a result. With the help of the elders and the current Sidhe Queen, she would be equipped with the abilities needed to take over the throne within the next ten years. After an unknown period of time, Zhou Weiqing gradually woke up from his coma. As he regained consciousness, he felt a bout of strange energy surge up within him. What was most peculiar was the fact that his will became a lot stronger than before. Even when he did not deliberately use it, his spiritual world actually lit up - he was aware of everything going on within his body. What is happening? Zhou Weiqing was in disbelief when he found out that his meridians, bones and internal organs were stronger than before - so strong that it made one’s hair stand on end in anger. There was a faint layer of blackish gray energy that was circulating continuously above his bones, flickering with a faint fluorescent light. His entire body was filled with a terrifying energy that could tear heaven and earth apart. The Nebula Saint Energy within his body also seemed to be refined as well - its original color, reddish gold, had become duller, going towards white gold on the spectrum. Even his cultivation base had already advanced to High Level Heavenly Emperor Stage. What the hell! Am I dreaming? How is this possible? Even if he absorbed the Heavenly Core Nucleus Feedback Energy of four or five Heavenly Emperors via the Astral Feedback, he would still be unable to advance that much. Not forgetting the changes of his body - they made Zhou Weiqing feel a sense of power that was out of this world. “Eh?” At this time, he felt something soft on his body. Instinctively, he opened his eyes. The first thing that came into view was a head of long bluish green hair. Faint nature aura had transformed into the purest fragrance in the world, making Zhou Weiqing feel relaxed and happy. He subconsciously lifted both hands and embraced the delicate body that was on him. Her very soft and supple body immediately caused that fella to have a reaction in just a short period of time. Who is this? None of his wives had long bluish green hair! Just as Zhou Weiqing turned around to sit up and pulled the delicate figure closer to his chest, he saw her pale face and his eyes almost fell out of their sockets - he even almost pushed her away from his embrace. The sky and earth has collapsed - why was the Sidhe Queen butt naked in my embrace! Zhou Weiqing was so shocked that his high-spirited self became mellow and well-behaved immediately. Even when he was trying to get fresh with Dongfang Hanyue, he was not as nervous as he was at this moment. The first thing that came to his mind was that if the Sidhe Tribe knew about him hugging their queen, who was butt naked, it would be impossible for the entire tribe to not hunt him down and kill him. After the brief shock blew over, Zhou Weiqing ultimately did not dare to toss the Sidhe Queen out of his arms. Instead, he quickly looked to his left and right before releasing his will, making sure that there were no human beings within a radius of a few hundred miles. After that, he hurriedly took out a set of his clothes and put them on the Sidhe Queen, before carefully placing her on the ground. He had also gotten himself dressed before he tried to recall what happened. The fight - the first thing Zhou Weiqing recalled was the fight. In actual fact, when they had started chasing the man in black earlier, it did cross Zhou Weiqing’s mind that he might use the Sidhe Princess to threaten them. Because of that, Zhou Weiqing had made prior preparations. Frankly speaking, he had anticipated the situation whereby the Sidhe Queen would attack him in a frenzy the moment he struck the Sidhe Princess. However at that point in time, he had absolutely no way of informing her about his plans. Regardless of what method he could have used to convey the message to her, even if it was just a change in the look in his eyes, the Heavenly Emperor Stage man in black, who was also extremely tensed, would definitely be able to pick up on it. All their efforts would have gone to waste with one misstep, and could even lead to the Sidhe Princess’ demise. Hence, at that time, all Zhou Weiqing could do was to grit his teeth and take it upon himself. The ball of white golden light was a special ability he had received upon ascending to the Heavenly Emperor Stage - it could temporarily allow for the usage of the nebulas in the sky to erupt the strongest attack or defense. This technique was called Mini Nebula Cosmos. Once the Mini Nebula Cosmos was used, Zhou Weiqing would then temporarily possess Nebula Saint Energy that was a level higher. In other words, the white golden Nebula Saint Energy would most likely be what he would possess when he advanced to the Heavenly God Stage. In order to ensure the little Sidhe Princess’ safety, Zhou Weiqing channeled all of that energy into her body without reservation. As one could imagine how strong Saint Energy was at the Heavenly God Stage, it was a blessing in disguise for the Sidhe Princess - not only did she receive Saint Energy that was purer than that of Zhou Weiqing’s, it also rendered any attacks made by the man in black ineffective. Under such circumstances, how would it be impossible for Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen to get her back? That was Zhou Weiqing’s plan. Since he had anticipated the Sidhe Queen’s reaction, when he released the white golden light, he had also raised his defense to its maximum and fully took the Sidhe Queen’s blow head-on. However, he had underestimated the power of a Heavenly God - she had broken his strong defense entirely. Her attack at full force had broke his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set and he would not be able to use it for at least ten days. At the same time, his Immortal Deity Shield and Demon God Protective Body had been destroyed as well. If not for his many layers of defense, coupled with his tough body, Zhou Weiqing could have died. Saint Energy was not omnipotent; if Zhou Weiqing was thoroughly destroyed, Saint Energy would not be able to save him, regardless of how strong it was. Fortunately, Zhou Weiqing was able to withstand the hit and could even use his last ounce of strength to kill the enemy. When he had completed his task, he naturally heaved a sigh of relief. With the enemy dead and the little Sidhe Princess rescued from him, no matter how dull-witted the Sidhe Queen was, she would be able to see what he did for them. Hence, right before he fell into a coma, a smile appeared on his face. As for the crafty look in his eyes, it was because he reckoned that his mission to retrieve the blood of the Sidhe Queen would be a success. After all, he had put in a lot of blood and sweat! He even got himself injured.
