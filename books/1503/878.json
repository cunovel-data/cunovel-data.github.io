From the start to the end, his ambitious nature was the cause of everything. “We are one. Why ask that question?” Yun Ruoyu laughed softly - her laugh was like a gentle breeze. Huang Xingyun laughed, “Ruoyu, can I kiss you?” Yun Ruoyu laughed once again and slowly lifted her head, kissing him with her red lips. She murmured, “I still remember how it was like the first time you kissed me. I love you, Xingyun.” “I love you too.” Huang Xingyun slowly lowered his head; crystal clear tears flowed unrestrained from his eyes. Indeed, he had regretted everything - regretful over his stupidity. In this moment, he had a sudden realization that power and ambitions were nothing compared to his wife. They locked lips; once again, they felt each other’s warmth and breath. Additionally, they were trembling with reluctance to part with one another. Boom—— A terrifying sound of explosion, that seemed like it was going to shatter the entire Mainland, was accompanied by an extremely terrifying distorted halo that was released on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. This was the end to a man’s ambitions, and also an end to an unchanging love - even after death. Perhaps, Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyu’s ambitions had killed many people, making them the demons that had affected the entire Boundless Mainland. However, this did not affect their unchanging love. In this aspect, Zhou Weiqing could only to blush with shame in comparison. The surrounding space became distorted, and so did the entire Heavenly Snow Mountain. Within the distortions, the enormous mountain peak that was thousands of meters tall quietly broke apart. It did not explode, and neither were there any explosion sounds that followed after. Under the distorted light, the enormous mountain peak gradually broke apart, vanishing into nothingness. Before the momentary explosion, all the powerhouses, who were previously on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, were at least a hundred miles away. Even then, they could still sense a tremendous force pushing them another hundred miles away. If not for the reluctance of Huang Xingyun and his wife to part with one another, the self-detonation of two High Level Heavenly Gods would have led to the demise of at least half of the remaining powerhouses on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Sorrowful love - perished; yet at the same time, benefiting others. Fen Tian’s Destruction Celestial Territory had undergone some changes the moment he worshipped the Lord of the Nether - it had restricted and detained every individual who had possessed the Destruction Energy. Hence, the members of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Peerless Sect could escape, whereas the members of the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell could not. Fen Tian’s Destruction God tried his best to send as many powerhouses from those two Saint Lands as he could up into the sky. In spite of that, nearly half of them still ended up perishing at the hands of the terrifying explosion. The ones who managed to get shot into the sky naturally merged together with Fen Tian’s purplish black light ball. And the remaining powerhouses that got perished on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain ended up contributing their Heavenly Core Nucleus that had entered the Astral Celestial Territory, transforming into Heavenly Core Nucleus Feedback. The Heavenly Snow Mountain had perished - the Heavenly Snow Mountain that had a height of five thousand feet had perished in this explosive war. Xue AoTian, who was far away, was filled with agony at this very moment. When he had seen the emergence of so many Heavenly Gods, he had expected such a scenario to happen. However, witnessing a Saint Land that had been around for thousands of years perish before his eyes, one could well imagine the agony in his heart. At this juncture, the war was reaching to an end. It could be said that the Peerless Sect, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain had achieved an overwhelming victory together. Even though the one who suffered the most losses was the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the number of powerhouses that they had lost was in the acceptable range - except that the Heavenly Snow Mountain had vanished from the face of the earth. As for the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley, apart from the fact that Fen Tian’s Destruction Energy was frantically rising, their entire army had been wiped out. After all, for the sake of this war, they had already sent out their main forces. It could be said that from this moment onwards, the two Saint Lands had ceased to exist. Amongst the survivors, the only person who was in greater agony was none other than Fen Tian. Even though he had already transformed into the Destruction God, Fen Tian’s eyes were filled with ferocious hate, while he was being enveloped in the enormous purplish black light ball. Due to Huang Xingyun and his wife’s self-detonation, only the Demon God and the Destruction God were left in the sky above the Heavenly Snow Mountain. As they were hovering high up in the sky, they did not suffer a huge impact from the detonation. Additionally, the light that was flashing on each of their bodies appeared to be brighter and stronger. The dazzling starlight surrounding Zhou Weiqing’s body continuously experienced changes - the original whitish golden light that was mixed with yellowish golden light had gradually changed. The yellowish golden starlight had quietly vanished following each Astral Feedback. At this moment, all that was left surrounding Zhou Weiqing’s body was the whitish golden light. Even the Astral Celestial Territory within the sky had turned into the same bright light. The total amount of Astral Feedback this time was too huge; a Heavenly God’s Astral Feedback was even more intense than all the Astral Feedbacks, Zhou Weiqing had conducted in the past, combined. Moreover, earlier on, this war had taken the lives of several powerhouses. Apart from the detonation of Huang Xingyun and his wife’s Heavenly Core Nucleus, the Heavenly Core Nuclei of the majority of the powerhouses were channeled into this Astral Feedback. Streaks of pure Creation Saint Energy merged with his body, yet Zhou Weiqing felt very strange - he did not experience the inflating feeling that he used to feel in the past when he was about to make a breakthrough. At this moment, he could only feel clear qi rising up within his body. It was a wonderful promotion process, as though he had left the current world he was in and entered into a different world. Impure qi was constantly being dispelled from within his body; the impurities within the Saint Energy were also being dissolved at an extremely fast speed. Additionally, fine spatial cracks were constantly appearing around Zhou Weiqing. In the past, Zhou Weiqing would have definitely assumed the spatial crevices were caused by violent energy ripples. However, he completely did not think that was the case this time. He could clearly sense that within every crevice, there was a small space, and these spaces were created from the Saint Energy that was released from his body. Zhou Weiqing slowly started to comprehend the situation. Creation, creation, is this Creation Energy? Within his eyes, it seemed as though he was looking at everything that happened eons ago; countless chaotic yet realistic fragments of images continuously flashed across his mind. At this time, the Demon God silently collapsed. In mid-air, all was left was Zhou Weiqing’s actual body. His entire body was whitish gold, his ten fingers were moving rhythmically and each time they moved, fine crevices appeared on his palms, coupled with all kinds of attributes. The attributes that appeared the most were Time, Demonic, Divine and Spirit. These are the four present great Saint Attributes, and they were all presented around Zhou Weiqing’s body. Strange energy ripples became stronger and more intense as a result. At this time, a spatial crevice appeared next to Zhou Weiqing without warning. A slender figure stepped out of it and her pale palm felt around before holding Zhou Weiqing’s hand. Next to her, four strange rays of light were flickering. It was Tian’er. Saint Energy was cultivated by both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er. Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to enter the next realm, increasing the purity of the Saint Energy, the Saint Energy had automatically sensed Tian’er’s presence. After all, it was created by both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er together. Without Tian’er, there was no way Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy would be complete. Zhou Weiqing held Tian’er’s hand. In this moment, the robust Saint Energy within his body rushed out immediately, enveloping Tian’er’s body within it. What made Zhou Weiqing astonished was that the Saint Energy within Tian’er’s body became as pure as his in an instant. The four great Saint Attributes around the two of them merged immediately. In this moment, it was as though they had become conjoined twins - they were one. The whitish golden halo became more and more intense. The Astral Celestial Territory above their heads continuously expanded. The Astral Saint Core Nucleus within their bodies also started to undergo changes. Layers of halo started stripping from the Astral Saint Core Nucleus. The original Saint Core Nucleus gradually took on human forms. Indeed, they took on human forms that were the exact same replica as Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er. They were entirely whitish golden, within Zhou Weiqing’s chest was a tiny person, who looked exactly the same as him, sitting cross-legged. Similarly, it had a life - a life that was completely connected to Zhou Weiqing’s. It was a life that was created from the Saint Energy. Saint God Core Nucleus. It was created by the evolution of the Saint Energy and the Saint Core Nucleus. When the Saint God Core Nucleus had taken the human form, a ball of dazzling radiance erupted from Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s body. The specks of starlight around them had vanished. Instead, they were each like an enormous star, as radiant light spread out from within them. The rich whitish golden light lit up the entire sky, and the Destruction Celestial Territory, that was shrouded here, had disappeared almost immediately the moment it got into contact with the layer of the whitish golden light. Only the enormous purplish black light ball was still hovering there. Even then, dense layers of energy halos continued to rise above the purplish black light ball. The powerhouses of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the Peerless Sect and the Heavenly Snow Mountain had already flown back - hundreds of miles were considered nothing to them. However, at this moment, nobody dared to approach this area. Everyone could see that the battle between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian was absolutely more terrifying that the battle earlier on with Huang Xingyun and his wife. On the ground, where the Heavenly Snow Mountain used to stand, there was a deep cave with a diameter of 300 meters. There was no way of knowing how deep the cave was - it stretched as far as the eye could see. However, its hidden depth was sufficient to send a chill down anyone’s spine. Xue AoTian, Shangguan Tianyang, Shangguan Tianyue, Long Shiya, Wu Yunyue, Dongfang Hanyue, as well as Zhou Weiqing’s partners gathered together, anxiously watching the battle before their eyes. “I did not expect that fellow to be the strongest here. If he’s able to defeat Fen Tian, in that case, Brother Xue, I’m afraid you ought to give the ‘World’s No. 1’ title to him,” said Shangguan Tianyang with a soft sigh.
