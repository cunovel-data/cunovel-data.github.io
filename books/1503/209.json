You will want to be able to fully focus and concentrate when Consolidating, to feel the every change, flow and movement of your Heavenly Energy. Once you immerse your mind and soul into it, your chances of succeeding will be higher. You must remember, although there are a hundred scrolls in every Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scroll set, it does not guarantee a hundred percent success. As such, you should treasure every scroll and try to ensure your success. When I return, I hope to see that everyone of you has their first Consolidated Equipment. At the same time, our class will soon have an assistant teacher, as I mentioned before. He is also a Consolidating Equipment Master, and if you all have any questions in this area, you can ask him. That fellow is sleeping right now, and I estimate that he’ll probably sleep for two days before he wakes up.”\\n\\n Indeed, Yun Li was now in deep sleep in the dormitory, while Zhou Weiqing was standing here with dark circles around his eyes. After giving out all the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, he relaxed. With Ming Hua and Yun Li here, along with the protection from the Academy, the commoner students were not likely to suffer any bullying. Furthermore, their fighting spirit had been sparked, and anyone who tried to bully them would have a fight on their hands indeed.\\n\\n “Bing’er, I’m heading back home to take a bath first. If the Principal sends someone to look for us, just get him to wait a while. Brothers and Sisters, I am heading off first. You all can wait for great news about your Class Monitor’s exploits on the field of the Grand Heavenly Jewel Master Tournament! Hahaha!” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing ran off quickly.\\n\\n This time, Zhou Weiqing did not even bother leaping across the walls. With his current look, most people who weren’t familiar with him would not be able to recognize him.\\n\\n Quickly rushing home, he took a cold bath before changing into a set of clean clothes. However, this time, he did not wear his school uniform. After that, he headed back to the academy, vaulting over the wall once more. These few days, the Little White Tiger Fat Cat had always been together with him, and was currently sleeping in his bosom.\\n\\n As they leaving today, Shangguan Bing’er also brought Da Huang and Er Huang together.\\n\\n Perhaps it was because of constant exposure to Little Fat Cat, these two large fellows also loved sleeping. Each time they slept, it was almost for several days, and because they ate so much, they grew extremely quickly.\\n\\n By the time Zhou Weiqing returned to the Academy, he saw Shangguan Bing’er and Ye Paopao waiting t the front gate. Beside them stood the Dean of Students, Dean Xiao. Ye Paopao was still dressed in his school uniform, and was not carrying bag, clearly equipped with a Spatial Item. Zhou Weiqing had heard from Kou Rui that Ye Paopao was actually the eldest grandson of the Prime Minister of the Fei Li Empire. He was considered and being groomed to be the successor of the Ye Family, and was definitely the most promising and outstanding amongst the youths of the Ye Family. This was also one of the reasons why he had such a status in the Fei Li Military Academy.\\n\\n By now, it had just entered the autumn season; although it was still relatively hot, it was already starting to cool down. At such an early hour of the morning, the air was clear and fresh, especially with the close proximity to the Fei Li Lake, causing the air to be damp and cooling, giving them a refreshing feeling.\\n\\n “Dean Xiao, good morning.” Zhou Weiqing went forward and bowed to Xiao Shi.\\n\\n Xiao Shi smiled faintly and said: “This time, the three of you will be representing our academy to attend the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Although you are only substitutes, you are still representing our academy, and more importantly, representing the entire Fei Li Empire. All of you are intelligent young kids, so I will not emphasize any further. Amongst the three of you, Ye Paopao is the eldest, so he will be your leader during this period. At the same time, you all must maintain good relations with the members of the main team from the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy; do not clash with them and try to coordinate well with them.”\\n\\n The three of them exchanged glances, before nodding to Xiao Shi, who then took out a card and handed it to Ye Paopao. “He is two thousand gold coins, meant for emergency funds for during your three months. It isn’t much, but it’s just a token from the Academy. The team uniform will be given out at the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy later. Alright, that’s it, let’s head out.”\\n\\n The Heavenly Jewel Master Academy was very close to the Fei Li Military Academy, barely a few walls apart. Although the entire student population of the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy barely numbered more than a hundred, the size of their academy was no smaller than the Fei Li Military Academy. Heavenly Jewel Masters were after all considered the cream of the crop amongst Jewel Masters, and not only did their Academy not have any school fees, their students actually received some form of pocket money. Some especially talented and outstanding students actually got their Consolidating Equipment and Skill Storing paid for and handled by the academy. Even the living accommodations of the dorms were much better, with each student have their own large personal room, unlike the shared living accommodations of the Fei Li Military Academy.\\n\\n After Xiao Shi led the three of them over to the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, they saw a teacher standing outside the gate waiting for them.\\n\\n The waiting teacher looked to be about forty years of age, a stable solid countenance with a dependable air about him. When he spotted Xiao Shi, he headed forward with a big smile on his face; at the same time, his gaze swept across the three young students.\\n\\n Although he did not particularly reveal his aura of power, but when his gaze swept past them, Zhou Weiqing and the others could feel a sense of pressure, proving how powerful that teacher was.\\n\\n “Dean Xiao, good to see you, we have troubled you to escort your students over.” The teacher said politely to Xiao Shi.\\n\\n Xiao Shi laughed and said: “No problems at all, that is my duty. This has to do with our Empire’s reputation and honour after all, and it is also both our academy’s honour. The Principal asked me to bring these kids over, I will have to trouble Teacher Li to take good care of them.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing had been looking at this Teacher Li all this time, and he noticed a flash of disdain spark in his eyes when Xiao Shi spoke about the honour of both academies. Clearly, he did not think much about them.\\n\\n Teacher Li said: “Dean Xiao is too courteous. I shall go ahead and bring them in then. This Tournament, our team is being led by our top student. He actually attended the previous round of the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, and we have much confidence in him and his leadership, and we will not be sending a teacher along.”\\n\\n When Xiao Shi heard that, he couldn’t help but exclaim in shock: “To have a student lead the team without an accompanying teacher? Isn’t that too careless?”\\n\\n A flash of pride appeared in Teacher Li’s eyes, as he said: “Our top student has been praised many times by our Principal, and more importantly, his power is probably no lesser than mine. After this Heavenly Jewel Tournament, he will also graduate. Perhaps, this round, under his leadership, it might be time for our Empire to shine, perhaps even with the possibility of entering the top four.”\\n\\n Xiao Shi couldn’t help but feel surprised. After all, he knew that this Teacher Li was one of the top powerhouses amongst the six-Jeweled High Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters, although he had not reached the Zong Stage yet. Even so, for him to praise a student like that, it could be seen how outstanding that student was.\\n\\n As such, Xiao Shi smiled and said without a change of expression: “If that is true, we are lucky to benefit from association. Teacher Li, I will take my leave now then.”\\n\\n That Teacher Li bowed slightly in return, watching Xiao Shi leave, his smile also vanishing at the same time as he nodded towards Zhou Weiqing and the rest and said: “Come, follow me.” After saying that, he turned around and left.\\n\\n Ye Paopao’s faint voice sounded in Zhou Weiqing’s ear: “Little bro, do not feel out of sorts from that. The Heavenly Jewel Master Academy has always been like that, but they can back that attitude with their power. It can be said that most of the powerhouses in our Fei Li Empire has come from that Academy.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing nodded slightly. Confidence comes from Power, that was a principle he could understand.\\n\\n Teacher Li did not even turn his head around once as he led the three of them deeper into the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy. The main building of the academy was not as huge as the Fei Li Military Academy’s, but their fields and sports grounds were much larger, being divided into several sections, though they could not tell what each section was for yet.\\n\\n The Teacher Li led them forward all the way to the center of the field before finally stopping and saying: “The three of you, wait here. The main team members will soon join you here before you all set of. Remember, your actions represent our Fei Li Empire’s honour, you do not need to fight any battles, but you all better be careful with your mouths and actions, and do not cause any trouble or impede the main team. Otherwise, even if you aren’t from our academy, we will still punish you severely when you return. Understand?”\\n\\n A sharp, forceful gaze shot forth from Teacher Li’s eyes, and an invisible pressure seemed to tighten around Zhou Weiqing and the rest of them. Ye Paopao quickly said: “We understand.”\\n\\n On hearing that, Teacher Li finally left, expressionless.\\n\\n After he had left, Ye Paopao said rather helplessly: “The are indeed from the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, full of pride and arrogance. Weiqing, what do you think of that Teacher Li’s cultivation level?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s face was peaceful. After all, he was used to such gazes from a young age, being looked down upon was something he could easily ignore.\\n\\n With a smile on his face, he said: “That Teacher Li’s cultivation level should be very high. My estimate is that he is at least at the five, probably six-Jeweled level.”\\n\\n Ye Paopao nodded and said: “I’ve heard that the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy’s recruitment is extremely stringent. Not only do the students’ cultivation level have to be at least of the two-Jeweled stage, they must also go through a series of extremely strict tests. If their Stored Skills or Consolidated Equipments are trash, they may be rejected from the academy. As for teachers who are actually able to be hired here, the minimum requirement is at least five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters. It can be said that the academy only has the elites among all elites. Our Academy produces the most generals, while this place is the birthplace of many a power house. Luckily, we are complementary and not competing, otherwise, their attitudes towards us might be even worse. Earlier, that Teacher Li said that this time the leader will be the top student of their Academy… Could it be him?”\\n\\n “Him? Who is him?” Zhou Weiqing asked curiously.\\n\\n Ye Paopao paused, and said: “I’ve heard that there is this young talent from the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy. In the past, when he entered, he was already at a three-Jeweled cultivation level at such a young age, and after the first year, he actually broke through to the four-Jeweled level. By now… he is probably at least five-Jeweled, otherwise that Teacher Li wouldn’t say he could fight with him. This top student usually keeps a very low profile, and although I have tried to investigate more about him, I have not been able to find anything out. The Heavenly Jewel Master Academy has definitely protected him and his secrets well. In fact, after my father found out about my investigations, he gave me a huge scolding. It looks like today we will finally be able to meet this legendary person.”\\n\\n Just as he finished speaking, five people walked out of the main building, heading towards them.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-8-chapter-64-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
