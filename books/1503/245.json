Normally, there weren’t many customers, and at this time, no one came to disturb them. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er stood there for almost an hour without seeing anyone pass.\\n\\n As the time came by, Shangguan Bing’er slowly calmed down. She knew that what Zhou Weiqing said was right, no matter what happened between her parents, as their daughter, she would have to try her best to help them.\\n\\n All of a sudden, two bright white lights flashed up like a bolt of lightning striking from below, and the two of them felt a flash before their eyes as two people appeared abruptly before them.\\n\\n One of them was naturally Shangguan Xue’er, her hand held by the other person. It was a man, looking around thirty years of age, dressed in a plain long white robe. A head of black hair neatly combed behind his head, and his handsome features were enough to cause Zhou Weiqing to have a bout of envy. This man gave Zhou Weiqing a sense of familiarity, as if he had seen him somewhere before.\\n\\n The middle aged man was clearly emotionally agitated, his white robe seeming to reflect his feelings as it rippled in massive waves. He felt as if he was an ordinary person, not giving forth any aura or signs of power, but that somehow gave Zhou Weiqing an even scarier feeling.\\n\\n “You… you’re Bing’er?” The middle aged man’s voice was quavering as he spoke, and Zhou Weiqing could clearly see that his lips were also quivering as he stared at Shangguan Bing’er, who was in Zhou Weiqing’s arms. His eyes were red, as if the tears within were brimming and on the verge of falling out.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er seemed to sense something, and stood up from Zhou Weiqing’s embrace, staring blankly at the middle aged man as she said softly: “Yes, I … I am Shangguan Bing’er.”\\n\\n “Bing’er, Bing’er, my daughter!” The middle aged man abruptly took a step forward, enveloping Shangguan Bing’er in his embrace as tears streamed down his cheeks.\\n\\n As soon as he started crying, Zhou Weiqing was startled to find that the entire atmosphere seemed to be filled with a sorrowful air, as if thousands of people were gathered there solemnly sorrowful. His own body felt as if it was being affected by the atmosphere, moving his emotions as well, and he almost teared as well.\\n\\n What kind of power was that? Was that even in the realms of human possibility? Zhou Weiqing stared at the middle aged man. At the same time, he could sense Fat Cat squirming deeper into his embrace, as if trying to hide, and could sense its terror.\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er, who was standing behind the man, was also crying, her eyes blood red.\\n\\n “Let… let go of me.” Shangguan Bing’er protested softly. Before this middle aged man, she had only been hugged by another man, Zhou Weiqing, and she was not used to being in a stranger’s embrace.\\n\\n The middle aged man stiffened, slowly releasing his arms as he looked at Shangguan Bing’er agitatedly. “Bing’er, I am your Father, I am your Father! Did your mother ever tell you that your father’s name is Shangguan Tianyue. I was wrong, all of it, it is all my fault. Years ago, I let down your mother! Quick, tell me, where is your mother staying? I have been looking for you both for nineteen years!”\\n\\n Hearing the words Shangguan Tianyue, comprehension suddenly dawned upon Zhou Weiqing. He finally understood why the middle aged man in front of him looked so familiar. His looks were very similar to the ZhongTian Emperor, Shangguan Tianxin! No, it could be said to be almost exactly the same, but that day they had been just too far from the VIP stage in the plaza, and Shangguan Tianxin had been wearing a dragon robe, which looked so different from the one Shangguan Tianyue was wearing now, and he had not recognized him right away.\\n\\n Without question, this Shangguan Tianyue and Shangguan Tianxin were related, perhaps even brothers… does that mean my Bing’er is actually a princess? And… a princess of the ZhongTian Empire!?\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er took a step back, leaning onto Zhou Weiqing as she stared at Shangguan Tianyue in front of her, her eyes filled with a confused, complicated look as tears streamed down from them. Logic told her that this was indeed her father, but she somehow couldn’t call out the word ‘Father’.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyue ignored Zhou Weiqing, as if he were air, instead asking urgently: “Bing’er, I’ve finally found you. How about your mother? Did she come as well? Is she finally willing to forgive me?”\\n\\n Right at that moment, a dozen or so people rushed up and down the stairs, reaching them before kneeling at a distance, saying respectfully: “Greetings, Second Palace Master.” Amongst them was the first level manager they had seen earlier, Wu Wenjie.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyue furrowed his brow, a little irritated at the interruption. “Please, get up, we do not need you here. Carry on.”\\n\\n The dozen or so powerhouses who were clearly the managers of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion vanished quickly.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyue took in a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down as he turned back to Shangguan Bing’er, who was still staring dazedly as she cried. In a gentle tone, he said: “Bing’er, this isn’t the place to talk, come back home with father? We can talk when we’re home, okay?”\\n\\n As he said that, he lifted his hand to pull on Shangguan Bing’er, but she was like a startled little bird, and in a flash she had moved behind Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n “Senior, please calm down, do not scare Bing’er.” Zhou Weiqing quickly moved his body to shelter Shangguan Bing’er behind her. Although he knew that his cultivation level was likely impossibly far from this father-in-law-to-be of his, he still stood in front of Shangguan Bing’er. As a man, even if he was afraid of death, if his woman was in danger, he would not hesitate to protect her.\\n\\n “Who are you?!” Shangguan Tianyue saw a stranger standing in front of his daughter, and his voice turned icy instantly.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Senior, I am Bing’er’s fiance.”\\n\\n “Fiance?” Shangguan Tianyue’s voice raised up much higher, as he swept a fierce gaze on Zhou Weiqing. He then said rudely: “You? A mere Higher Level Shi Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, barely breaking thirteen level of Heavenly Energy? You? Want to be my daughter’s fiance?”\\n\\n Hearing his words, Zhou Weiqing was shocked. He was not using any Heavenly Energy, and with just a single look, Shangguan Tianyue had been able to tell his cultivation level so accurately.\\n\\n “Senior, my cultivation level has nothing to do with the feelings between Shangguan Bing’er and I.” Zhou Weiqing said simply. neither servile nor overbearing. [1. Is it bad that I wanted him to say ‘This is why your wife left you.’ Lol. He probably would have been killed though haha]\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyue said coldly: “How can there be no connection? To be my Shangguan Tianyue’s daughter in law, you must be a dragon or phoenix amongst men. What are you? No looks, no cultivation, and you want to marry into my Heaven’s Expanse Palace?!”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s face turned cold. If anyone else looked down upon him, insulted him, if his power was sufficient, he would definitely leave them with an unforgettable experience, and if his power wasn’t sufficient, he would hold back, remember that, and show them in the future. However, this person in front of him was Shangguan Bing’er’s father, his future father-in-law, this could possibly determine whether or not he could be with Shangguan Bing’er in the future. Furthermore, he said that in front of Shangguan Bing’er; as such, our dear Little Fatty was unable to hold himself back from retorting.\\n\\n “Senior, you are right. I do not have the looks, nor do I have the cultivation level. In your eyes, I may be nothing, just a small fry. However, I love Bing’er, and am willing to do anything for her. Furthermore, Bing’er is already mine, we have already been intimate, and there is nothing you can do to change that. You are so obstinate and conceited, I can understand why Aunty Tang Xian left you.” [2. Damn! BURN! I totally did not think that he would say it! Haha!]\\n\\n “What did you say?” Shangguan Tianyue said angrily.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing felt his entire body tighten, and before he knew what happened, he was in Shangguan Tianyue’s hands, held by the neck and unable to breathe, and it was as if he had lost connection with his Heavenly Energy, and unable to do anything at all.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyue held Zhou Weiqing with one hand, while he looked at Shangguan Bing’er. His entire body shivered in rage, as he could easily see that she was no longer a virgin.\\n\\n “Let go! Let go of him!” Shangguan Bing’er was extremely urgent, and she quickly flew forward to clutch at Shangguan Tianyue’s arm.\\n\\n A profound meaning flashed, hidden, as he said solemnly: “Bing’er, follow me home and I’ll let him go. Otherwise, I’ll kill him now.”\\n\\n Without hesitation, Shangguan Bing’er said: “I’ll follow you home, quick, let go of him.”\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyue flung his right hand back out, and Zhou Weiqing’s body flew and landed right at the spot he was in earlier, as if he had not moved before.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyue pulled Shangguan Bing’er as he glared coldly at Zhou Weiqing and said: “Even if you stole my daughter’s virginity, that does not mean you can become my son in law.” After saying that, he did not allow the two to speak any further, and in a flash of bright light which enveloped both him and Shangguan Bing’er, they vanished.\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er glanced at Zhou Weiqing, hate in her eyes, before she chased after Shangguan Tianyue. Zhou Weiqing was left alone in the chamber, panting hard.\\n\\n In the next moment, Shangguan Tianyue appeared outside the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion. Shangguan Bing’er’s beautiful eyes were filled with rage. “Why did you treat Little Fatty like that? This life, I will only love Little Fatty.”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-9-chapter-76-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
