Taking a few steps, she chased after Ming Yu. “Brother Yu, I really do not have any connection to him.”\n Ming Yu said passively with a slight smile: “Difuya, you should know my temper and character. I do not want the possible name and reputation of being called a wife stealer. Furthermore, I have always kept my word on the things I said. I will overlook the fact that you lied to me, but do not look for me again. Otherwise, you know what will happen.” After leaving those words, he walked into the Skill Storing Palace without looking back, leaving the stunned Difuya standing in stupefaction.\n Zhou Weiqing’s original good mood had been totally ruined by the meeting with Difuya, and walking along the Fei Li City’s streets, he felt rather irked and irritated. Godfather ahh godfather, it’s not that I don’t want to give you face, but compared to Bing’er, I can never accept Difuya. The last remaining guilt in his heart towards Di Fengling regarding dissolving the engagement had been wiped out now, and he shook his head vigorously. With a cold humph, he muttered to himself: “It’s not worth it to get angry over her!”\n However, having experienced the two clashes with a young mid level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, it made Zhou Weiqing feel his severe lack of power. That Ming Yu’s Heavenly Energy was likely at the eighth level of the Heavenly Shen Energy, and was a lot stronger than him. If not for the fact that Zhou Weiqing’s physical strength was extraordinary, he would likely have taken a bigger loss earlier.\n As he mused about what happened earlier, Zhou Weiqing looked for a nearby inn to stay. He decided to recover his Heavenly Energy first before Consolidating the Legendary Set Equipment Scroll that he had. He would head to the Skill Storing Palace again tomorrow; with his Immortal Deity Technique’s fast recovery rate, he would likely be able to attempt skill storing twice without any issues.\n …\n Two Days Later.\n The eastern part of the Fei Li City was originally already the most prosperous part, and it seemed especially crowded and lively today. This was especially so around the academy district which was close to the Skill Storing Palace, where there was a massive bustling crowd. The main reason being that today was the start of the annual registration date for many of the large academies.\n The registration period was 3 days in total, with each academy having a different intake number and requirements. However, there was just a single rule in the Fei Li Empire - no matter commoner or noble, all would have to take the respective academy’s registration tests before being able to join.\n There were over a dozen various academies, of which the most famous were the three top academies, namely: Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy, Fei Li Empire Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, and the Fei Li Palace Academy.\n Of which, the Fei Li Palace Academy was famed for being the place which had nurtured many top civil officials. They also had the most stringent requirements amongst all the academies, all their students were restricted to only Fei Li Empire Citizens, and there were 3 days worth of examinations with 9 in total, each on various different aspects. Only the cream of the crop would be admitted. It also had the most registrations amongst all the academies, but their entrance rate was less than one in a hundred.\n Over 80% of the civil officials in the Fei Li Empire had graduated from this academy; from that you could tell the sheer amount of influence the academy had.\n On the other hand, the one with the relatively ‘easiest’, yet with the least amount of registrations, was the Fei Li Empire Heavenly Jewel Master Academy. There was only one requirement for registration - to be a Heavenly Jewel Master; while citizenship did not matter. However, if they were citizens of another empire, the requirement was to pledge allegiance to the Fei Li Empire. There were only a hundred or so current students in the academy, and it was usually considered good if they could get 8-10 new students every year. The Heavenly Jewel Master Academy was famed for being the cradle for cultivating many a powerful Heavenly Jewel Master. After all, the students in the academy were able to enter the Skill Storing Palace and go about Skill Storing for free during their study period. Such a favourable condition alone was more than sufficient to draw many young Heavenly Jewel Masters to register.\n The final one was of course the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy. The registration numbers were usually about a third of the Fei Li Palace Academy, but their acceptance rate was much higher, about one in thirty, and they were famed for nurturing many famous generals and military officials. This was the academy which Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er were applying to join.\n When Zhou Weiqing arrived at the entrance of the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy early in the morning, he was dazed. The entire street was filled with people, how could he possibly look for Shangguan Bing’er in such a crowd! With no better idea, he could only stand helplessly near the queue, his gaze constantly scanning the crowd for a sign of Shangguan Bing’er.\n While he was waiting anxiously, all of a sudden, a young skinny youth sidled up to him and said: “Bro, want a copy of the examination requirements and rules? With this, you will be better prepared for the exams. This is only sold today, only 10 gold coins!”\n Looking at the sheet of paper in his hands, Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: “One sheet of paper and you’re trying to sell it for 10 gold coins? Why don’t you go rob someone.” Who knew that the skinny youth said: “How can robbing compare to doing this, this earns much more and is a lot safer.”\n Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but laugh at that. “Fine, give me one.” He was just standing here idly anyway. He had decided to just stand here; after all he was very tall at 1.9 metres, and was standing in a rather obvious place, so it would be a lot easier for Shangguan Bing’er to see him than for him to look for her.\n After paying the 10 gold coins for a copy of the rules, he stood there and opened it to read. After he looked at the contents of the paper, he instantly realised he had been cheated. The header of the paper’s contents was titled ‘General Regulation for Enrollment’. Clearly, this was given to everyone who registered, yet it had cheated him out of 10 gold coins. However, it would be impossible to look for the same person in the crowd.\n Zhou Weiqing was speechless for a second, thinking to himself: If Old Scoundrel were here, he would scold me to death!\n In truth, the reason he got cheated wasn’t just because he was careless, but rather because he had been so anxious while waiting for Shangguan Bing’er, and feeling discomforted in his heart, he didn’t think much more. Furthermore, with several hundred thousand in his pocket, he naturally didn’t really care that much about the relative small sum of money.\n After header, the following was written: “After registration, applicants should bring their admission identification card and enter the academy to go through their exams. The exams are split into three portions, each worth a hundred marks. The tests are personal combat strength, written test on military knowledge, as well as a direct face to face interview. At the same time, it was also written that if someone managed to score full marks for any particular test, they could be admitted regardless of the results of their other two tests.\n Right below that were the required acceptance scored. For nobles, a total score of 150 was required, and for commoners, a total score of 180 was required.\n As soon as he saw that, Zhou Weiqing’s brow couldn’t help but furrow. So much for the Fei Li Empire’s pretty words, that no matter status or rank, they would all have to take examinations. In the end, the differentiation was after the examinations. I wonder if my rank of Viscount in the Heavenly Bow Empire counts as a noble or a commoner? He thought to himself.\n “What are you looking at?” Just as Zhou Weiqing was examining the rules, he felt his shoulder get tapped by someone. As soon as he turned around, he was greeted by a beautiful smiling face. It was Shangguan Bing’er.\n Zhou Weiqing was stunned for a second, and in the next instant, he unhesitatingly pulled her into his arms, hugging her tightly, drawing the gazes of everyone nearby.\n From the time he had met Shangguan Bing’er up til now, this was the first time that he had parted with her for such a long period of time. Previously, while training with Huyan Aobo, the feeling had not been so obvious as he had been so focused on learning and practicing. However, when he left the Flying Hill City, his heart and mind had always been with Shangguan Bing’er. That was the reason why he had been so anxious just now. Furthermore, having met Difuya two days earlier, that strong contrast between the two had just made him miss Shangguan Bing’er more, making him wish he had wings and could fly to her there and then. Now that he was finally reunited with her, how could he not be excited.\n Being hugged all of a sudden, Shangguan Bing’er was very embarrassed. However, feeling his rapid heartbeat and the arms holding her tightly, the bashfulness in her heart softened, and she slowly hugged him back as well, feeling peace in her heart.\n In truth, the past few months were also uncomfortable for her. Previously, when Zhou Weiqing was by her side, she did not feel so strongly about it. After all, he often made her angry when he teased her. However, after he had left, she had been left in peace, but this peace just made her think of him all the time. Even though she spent most of her time accompanying her mother, she still felt rather restless and fidgety. If not for the fact she was afraid of affecting Zhou Weiqing from learning how to create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, perhaps she would have gone to look for him earlier at the Flying Hill City.\n Earlier, she had seen Zhou Weiqing from the distance, standing there foolishly and looking around anxiously. At that moment, she had felt a warmth invading her heart, filling her with a sense of satisfaction that she had never had before. It had taken her some time to squeeze through the crowd to reach him.\n Now that they had reunited in the midst of the crowd, that sense of joy and excitement was released, and the two of them totally ignored the rest of the crowd, lost in their own world.\n “Bing’er, I’ve missed you. Especially these few days, I’ve really really missed you so much.” Zhou Weiqing lifted his head, looking at the blushing beauty before him. All of a sudden, he felt as if his mind was blank, having forgotten why he was even here.\n Shangguan Bing’er gave a soft sound of acquiescing, saying softly: “I’ve missed you too. Little Fatty, you’ve lost so much weight.”\n I’ve missed you. When Zhou Weiqing heard those words, he felt as if a gust of wind had blown the luck of the world into his face. Grinning, he said: “Can I kiss you?”\n Shangguan Bing’er was taken aback and said quickly: “No.”\n Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s crestfallen look, she looked down and said softly again: “Not here.”\n Zhou Weiqing’s eyes lit up, and he snuck closer to her ear and whispered: “I understand.”\n Shangguan Bing’er blushed, and hit him on the shoulder: “What do you understand?”\n Zhou Weiqing puffed up his chest, laughing as he said: “Understand means understand. Come on, let’s go register.” As he said that, he held Shangguan Bing’er’s hand and started squeezing deeper into the crowd towards their target. He was tall and strong, and before long they had managed to squeeze into one of the registration points.\n Speaking to the senior year student who was in charge of registration, he said: “Beautiful lady, we are here to register.”\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-39-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
