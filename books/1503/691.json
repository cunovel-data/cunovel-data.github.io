Little Fatty’s Power (1)\n Shangguan Tianyang stared at Zhou Weiqing, then said in a low voice: “Weiqing, for the sake of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and for the sake of this continent’s very survival, I’m not going to stand on ceremony any longer. I have to admit that you are the most suitable person for this matter.”\n Zhou Weiqing rubbed his head, then said, “But… there’s honestly a lot of things I need to handle. I probably won’t be able to head out just yet.”\n Shangguan Tianyang said, “The Xuantian Continent is tens of thousands of kilometers away from us, and Xuantian Palace is also incredibly strong. To ‘take food from the tiger’s mouth’ from them won’t be easy. You will need a great deal of time, so I hope you begin to act as soon as possible. As for your other matters, leave them to us. This old man swears to you as the Palace Lord of Heaven’s Expanse Palace that before you return, I absolutely will not permit the Heavenly Bow Empire to suffer any harm at all. I’ll also take care of your father’s safety. Once you return, I’ll send people to support you in restoring the kingdom and in rescuing your family members. Before you go, Tianyue and I will also officially engage you to Xue’er, Fei’er, and Bing’er. What do you think?”\n Shangguan Tianyang’s words were extremely enticing to Zhou Weiqing. He had never imagined that the Palace Lord of Heaven’s Expanse Palace would be so straightforward! Without question, Zhou Weiqing’s worries were centered around his family and the Heavenly Bow Empire. With this promise from Heaven’s Expanse Palace, he now had nothing to fear.\n He had never imagined that his marriage to the three Shangguan sisters would be approved so handily as well. As he saw it, there was definitely no problem with him marrying Bing’er, and he had a chance at Fei’er, but Shangguan Xue’er? Who was she? She was the heir and successor to the Palace Lord of Heaven’s Expanse Palace! If he was going to be officially engaged to her, then that meant that Shangguan Tianyang was virtually handing over half of Heaven’s Expanse Palace into his hands. In other words, the old man had shown the greatest amount of sincerity possible. It wasn’t really a ‘conditional offer’; something like this could only be described as ‘sincerity’. Zhou Weiqing was truly surprised that Shangguan Tianyang would act in such a way towards a junior like himself.\n The nearby Shangguan Fei’er couldn’t help but say: “Senior Uncle, does Weiqing really have to go? We have no idea what is going on in the Xuantian Continent. It’ll be very dangerous!” The other three women had ugly looks on their faces as well.\n Shangguan Tianyang let out sigh. “Weiqing might not be a truly supreme powerhouse, but his future potential is limitless. This is especially true now that he has Saint Energy. Now that he has changed a misfortune into a blessing and broken through to the nine-Jeweled stage, on the whole he’s just as strong as any Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. He’s also extremely young. It’ll be easy for him to hide himself in the Xuantian Continent and he won’t be easily noticed. That’s why I cannot think of a better choice than him.”\n Shangguan Tianyang was telling the truth. Although there were some other powerful Heavenly Jewel Masters outside the five Great Saint Lands, such as Zhou Weiqing’s master the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, they were incredibly rare. It would be very hard and time-consuming to find them, and even if they were found these Heavenly Emperor powerhouses wouldn’t necessarily agree to act on the behalf of Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Moreover, Zhou Weiqing was agile, clever, knew many survival techniques, and could use Saint Energy. There was no way the others could compare to him in these regards. He was also on extremely good terms with Heaven’s Expanse Palace!\n Zhou Weiqing chortled. “I agree that I’m the best suited. Since you’ve made the request, Uncle, I’ll move as fast as I can. I’ll put down everything else I’m working on and head straight to the Xuantian Continent to take back that Spatial Teleportation Gem. However, I cannot guarantee that I will succeed. You need to make backup preparations at Heavenly Jewel Island and ZhongTian City.”\n When Shangguan Tianyang heard Zhou Weiqing accept, his face revealed a hint of a smile. “Weiqing, thanks in advance for the hard work. This matter involves our palace’s very survival. Once we lose Heavenly Jewel Island, we’ll soon no longer be considered the number one Great Saint Land of this continent. If there’s anything you need done, just leave it to us.”\n Zhou Weiqing shook his head. “Aside from handling the dangers facing the Heavenly Bow Empire and my family members in Heavenly Bow City, there’s nothing else I need done. I’ll go by myself right away. You can simply update me on the situation a bit later.”\n “Unacceptable!” Right at this moment, all four of the woman shouted the same thing simultaneously.\n Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue, the two brothers, couldn’t help but stare at them in astonishment.\n The four women’s faces reddened slightly. In the end, it was the lively Shangguan Fei’er who gave the reason why. She gave Zhou Weiqing a hard look, then said: “This guy is a total playboy. What if he brings more girls back from the Xuantian Continent? That’s why we have to go with him.”\n Shangguan Tianyang’s face sank. “What nonsense! All of you are members of the Great Saint Lands. Are you going to have us go back on our word and the first to break our vows? Moreover, sending additional people will make us more conspicuous. If Weiqing goes by himself, he’ll also be able to slip away much more easily. He’s also already reached the nine-Jeweled stage. This experience is also a chance for him to establish his path for advancing to become a Heavenly King.”\n Shangguan Fei’er pouted unhappily, but she was rather afraid of her Senior Uncle and didn’t dare to say anything else.\n Right at this moment, Shangguan Bing’er suddenly summoned all her courage and walked forward: “I’ll go with Little Fatty. I don’t belong to the Saint Lands, I’ve never promised to join the Heaven’s expanse Palace, and I didn’t grow up here either.” After saying these words, she lowered her head in embarrassment. She had already been apart from Zhou Weiqing for three years. She truly did not wish to part with him again.\n The nearby Shangguan Xue’er nodded. “I agree that having Bing’er go with Weiqing is more suitable. She can take watch over him and take care of his food and lodging. Bing’er is also skilled in speed; if anything dangerous happens, she would be able to escape alongside Weiqing.”\n As she said this, she turned to glance at the nearby Tian’er. Her opinion clearly carried a great deal of weight. If she insisted that she was going to go with Zhou Weiqing, it wouldn’t be easy for Heaven’s Expanse Palace to stop her. Once she joined forces with Zhou Weiqing, both would be strengthened.\n Something unexpected happened. Tian’er actually nodded and said to Zhou Weiqing, “Letting Bing’er go with you is a good choice. However… Bing’er, don’t be too merciful. Don’t let this bad man bring another one back! I’ll go back to Heavenly Snow Mountain to visit Father.” The final sentence was aimed at Zhou Weiqing.\n Zhou Weiqing scratched his head. “I’m fine with whoever wants go with me.”\n Shangguan Xue’er said, “After you go, Fei’er and I will go to the Heavenly Bow Empire.”\n Zhou Weiqing naturally didn’t know that the reason why Tian’er didn’t insist on going with him to the Xuantian Continent was partially because the Saint Energy inside his body had already formed a perfect loop; there was now no longer any worry that it would wither away. The second, more important reason was because she wanted to demonstrate her friendship towards the three Shangguan sisters.\n Without question, none of the four could bear to part with Zhou Weiqing. Three of them were sisters of the Shangguan family! Tian’er had the feeling that she was all by herself, and so it was important to her for her to build up good relationships with the others. Bing’er had also met Zhou Weiqing before she did. Although she wasn’t really happy about this, in the end she managed to accept it.\n Shangguan Tianyang nodded. “Excellent. It is settled, then! Weiqing, Bing’er, the two of you follow me. I’ll tell you all the details of the situation in the Xuantian Continent.”\n They stayed at Heaven’s Expance Palace for a few more days. Zhou Weiqing disposed of all the things he needed to address, engaging in multiple secret conversations with Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue. As for what they discussed? Not even the three Shangguan sisters knew. However, they could guess that it had something to do with the destructive energies.\n At the same time, Zhou Weiqing asked Shangguan Tianyang to escort Tian’er back to Heavenly Snow Mountain. Although Tian’er was at a level of cultivation where she didn’t really need an escort, she was pregnant with Zhou Weiqing’s child! Zhou Weiqing just felt uneasy when he wasn’t by her side.\n As for the Heavenly Bow Empire, Zhou Weiqing sent several letters addressed to Ming Yu, Hua Feng, and the others which he had the Shangguan sisters deliver. Now that the two Head Drillmasters Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er were headed back, Zhou Weiqing wasn’t too worried about the situation there. He wasn’t really good at war or commanding troops; leaving these matters to Ming Yu and the others was far better than him handling it personally.\n On the dawn of the third day, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er secretly left Heavenly Jewel Island, departed from Zhongtian City, and began to hurry eastwards.\n Zhou Weiqing was pulling Shangguan Bing’er by the hand, and every so often she would look at his rather ashen face. “Little Fatty, are you uncomfortable?”\n Zhou Weiqing smiled. “I’m fine! My body’s in perfect shape. Why would I be uncomfortable?” There was naturally no way he would tell her that in recent days, Tian’er had ‘squeezed him dry’ on the bed due to his impending departure. She had taught him a thorough lesson! But of course, to Zhou Weiqing this ‘punishment’ was a wonderful and pleasurable experience.\n After leaving Zhongtian City, Zhou Weiqing released his Ghost Demon Horse and let Shangguan Bing’er ride in front of him. He himself wrapped his arm around her slender waist from behind while spurring the Ghost Demon Horse to gallop on the road eastwards.\n According to the map which Shangguan Tianyang had given him, the Xuantian Continent was located east of their continent, and so they had to enter the ocean via the easternmost Mi Ou Empire and then keep pushing east.\n For the sake of ensuring this mission’s success, Heaven’s Expanse Palace had not been stingy at all. Shangguan Tianyang had given Zhou Weiqing many fine things that were meant to handle all sorts of problems.\n Zhou Weiqing was extremely curious about the Xuantian Continent. It was a distant land past the seas, and it had been a thousand years since there had been any communication between it and the Boundless Mainland. The Xuantian Continent was definitely a very special place… and it would be no easy feat for anyone to steal one of the greatest treasures from a place like that!\n After travelling just thirty or so kilometers out of Zhongtian City, Zhou Weiqing suddenly forced his Ghost Demon Horse to slow down. He lowered his head, resting his chin against Shangguan Bing’er’s neck. His warm breath blew across her earlobes, causing her to feel itchy. She whispered, “Little Fatty, what are you doing?”\n Zhou Weiqing laid a gentle kiss against her tender cheeks. Just as Shangguan Bing’er was beginning to think that this bad man was about to resort to his usual tricks, he suddenly whispered something into her ears. Her slender body trembled, and the charming look in her eyes instantly vanished.\n The Ghost Demon Horse once more accelerated, but just a second later Zhou Weiqing suddenly disappeared from the back of the horse. Without any warning at all, he appeared in the air above a nearby copse of trees, then slammed both hands down. A terrifying blue light instantly came out of his hands, producing a purple-blue cloud of light. Thousands of Lightning Pearls instantly appeared, blanketing a spherical area of hundreds of meters.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-25-chapter-234-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
