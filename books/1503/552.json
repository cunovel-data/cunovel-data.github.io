Besides that, the other three Skills also sprang into effect simultaneously. The three Skills were the Lightning Suffering, Silver Emperor Wing Slash and the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce respectively. All were extremely powerful Skills, two of were Stored from the Silver Emperor. However, they all shared a certain characteristic - a strong explosive effect. Stacked together, they were able to boost each other. With the four Skills bursting out simultaneously, the white light around the giant sword was obviously weakened, and the speed slowed considerably, giving Zhou Weiqing even more time to react. As he was retreating at top speed, Zhou Weiqing\u0027s brain was working at top speed in the state of Icy Cold Senses. Besides focusing most of his senses on the terrifying giant sword and the various energy reverberations within, he was also clear about everything around in the surroundings, including the distance between the two, the difference in speeds, all win perfect judgement. With a faint smile, a cold light flashed across Zhou Weiqing\u0027s face. The Dual Legendary Hammers lifting in front of him once more. This time, he did not throw one out as he had earlier, instead his wings abruptly beat strongly and his entire body flew up into the air. Just as body flew upwards, a layer of purple light flamed out around Zhou Weiqing, staining all the \u0027Hate Ground no Handle\u0027 Legendary Set Consolidated Equipment with that same purple hue, even the Dual Legendary Hammers in his hands. Deep within his purple orbs, there was a demonic light, and his flying speed reached a terrifying height. The giant sword flying at him also increased speed abruptly. Previously, it was unable to do so due to the various Skills from Zhou Weiqing, and also because Shangguan Xue\u0027er did not want to use too much energy just on speeding up. After all, the normal speed of the giant sword was already pretty fast. However, as she saw Zhou Weiqing fly up, though her Boundless Infinitum Set could let her barely fly, it was more to let her maneuver in midair than flying speed, definitely not comparable to Shangguan Fei\u0027er\u0027s Consolidated Wings. Zhou Weiqing\u0027s flying speed was now fully displayed to Shangguan Xue\u0027er, and she was clear that if she allowed him to accelerate and continue, then she would not have a chance to lock that rascal down. Left with no choice, she had to suddenly force an acceleration on the giant sword, hoping to take him down before he could take off. However, much to her surprise, Zhou Weiqing only flew up less than ten yards into the air before he came to a screeching halt. The next instant, he suddenly accelerated in reverse, flying straight down like a meteor. A terrifying energy reverberated through the air, and Zhou Weiqing\u0027s entire body was like a huge energy ball smashing down. Indeed, Zhou Weiqing had flown up not to escape. He knew that was impossible. What he wanted was the momentum and build up the edge to actually fight. All this time, facing Shangguan Xue\u0027er\u0027s giant Boundless Infinitum Sword, he had been fully suppressed all the way. Under such a circumstance, even if he had one hundred and twenty percent power, he could at most use seventy percent. As such, he had to adjust his aura and momentum to be able to have a chance. Having flown up into the air, he was able to at last throw off the suppression and have the advantage of high ground. Although it did not affect Shangguan Xue\u0027er\u0027s momentum, at least he was now able to bring his full power into play. As the Dual Legendary Hammers drew a short and quick arc in the sky, his entire body spun in a 360 degree spin before smashing down towards the giant sword which was chasing towards him. Zhou Weiqing\u0027s Dual Hammers were now almost purely covered by purple light, as he blew up with a huge number of Skills, as he finished up almost all remaining Heavenly Energy. There were three main offensive Skills that were the backbone of his strategy. First was the Skill that Zhou Weiqing was most well-versed in, the Spatial Rend. Next was the Time Disorder Skill that prevented enemies from locking onto him. Lastly was the Lightning Explosive Palm. With the three main Skills exploding out, backed by his full strength and the sheer weight of the Legendary Hammers... in that instant Zhou Weiqing\u0027s offensive power was unbelievably terrifying. This was Zhou Weiqing\u0027s plan. Facing a sword of such extreme singularity, he decided to utilize his own strength, the extreme multiplicity. Without question, this was an act of last resort, with nothing held back or left behind. All of his Heavenly Energy was drained from this final blow, and unless he could Devour her Heavenly Energy, this would be his only chance. If this failed, he would be left totally at Shangguan Xue\u0027er\u0027s mercy, in absolute danger. As such, the only reason that he dared do this was that he felt Shangguan Xue\u0027er would not actually kill him off. If one paid close attention, the Skills that Zhou Weiqing used so far had all been different. In such a short period of time, he had gone through all his Stored Skills and divvied out his Heavenly Energy to his selection in a series of actions that could bring about his strongest offensive power. Currently, with both hammers slamming downwards, filled with their respective Skills, along with the earlier series of weakening Skills, the large gap between two was no longer so obvious. In mid air, the two massive energies smashed into each other. Strangely, there was no sound, but the effect on both was clear. Zhou Weiqing’s was perhaps the most direct. He felt as if his entire body, every inch of his muscles trembling, as if he had been immersed in the depths of her sword intent, and it was about to tear him into shreds. His body shuddered violently, and even his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set was unable to handle such a terrifying blow. After the moment of clashing ended, all of Zhou Weiqing’s Consolidated Equipment vanished just like that. At the same time, his body was sent flying back up into the sky in a strange arc, temporarily losing consciousness as he flew up and about. Shangguan Xue’er did not come off easy as well. Both of Zhou Weiqing’s Legendary hammers were backed by all the terrifying physical strength he had, with the boost of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation and the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set. Added on that was the boosts of his many ‘disgusting’ Skills. At the final instant, Shangguan Xue’er had clearly seen that Zhou Weiqing’s entire body had turned shadowy and illusory, and the last remnants of her sword intent had not been able to continue hurting that fellow. On her end, Shangguan Xue’er’s entire body was sent falling from the skies, smashing right into the ground, with her legs sent deep into the ground all the way to her knees. At her lips, a trickle of blood flowed down, and the right arm which had been holding onto the Boundless Infinitum Sword was trembling uncontrollably. Although her Boundless Infinitum Set did not vanish, it was clear that its glow was far dimmer than it had been, no longer shining with that snow-white lustre. Currently, Shangguan Xue’er felt as if her entire innards were upside down, her bloodflow in a mess. If not for the protection of the Boundless Infinitum Set, perhaps the impact of the blow would have severely injured her. Bastard! When did that bastard become so strong? To be able to receive that strongest blow of mine! In the distance, Zhou Weiqing’s body had completed a parabolic arc before falling to the ground. Shangguan Xue’er gritted her teeth, suppressing all the pain and uncomfortable feelings as she forcefully dragged her body from the muddy ground. Before pulling herself out, it had not been so obvious, but as soon as she did so, she saw the entire right pants leg had been torn asunder, revealing her smooth white skin. Shangguan Xue’er’s face turned red in embarrassment once more, almost instantly reminded of the incident that was the precursor of their fight. Gritting her teeth once more, the hate returned, and with great difficulty she shifted the Boundless Infinitum Sword to her left hand before charging towards Zhou Weiqing again. Although Zhou Weiqing had lost consciousness temporarily, it had only been for a short while, due to the incitement of Shangguan Xue’er’s sword intent. As he was falling from the top of the arc, he came to his senses only to see Shangguan Xue’er charging at him once more, shocking him fully awake. Currently, Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was barely a tenth of his maximum capacity. As the saying goes, a wise man knows not to fight when the odds are against him, only a fool would continue fighting with her. The enmity between them was not huge, or rather, was one sided, and he quickly regained control of his own body, the wings behind his back extending and preventing the fall before flying back up again slowly, attempting to get out of Shangguan Xue’er’s attack range. “Zhou Weiqing, you bastard! If you dare run away, I will immediately return to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and tell Fei’er and Bing’er how you violated me. I will make sure you never see them again!” Without question, that threat was the greatest threat Shangguan Xue’er could ever make. Zhou Weiqing’s body froze in midair, and he indeed did not dare to continue flying up. Maintaining his position, he faced downwards towards her and said helplessly: “Big Sis, what do you want to do? Even if you really kill me, do you think that is satisfactory? After all, no matter what I am still your brother-in-law! I know, just now that was all my fault, but I had really made a mistake in recognizing the wrong person. Furthermore, even if we continued fighting, you may not even win against me.” “Bullshit! You think you can defeat me?! Zhou Weiqing, you have violated me and I will not let you go. Come down here. Don’t think I can’t see that your Heavenly Energy is almost out… you think you still can fight?” Shangguan Xue’er did not relent, and from the looks of things she wanted to finish him off! Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \"What if I defeat you then? Can we drop what happened today?\" Shangguan Xue\u0027er said angrily: \"What if you lose then?\" Zhou Weiqing drew himself up imposingly and said in a stately tone: \"If I lose, then I lose, so be it!\" In terms of being shameless, he had never been afraid of anyone! \"You...\" Shangguan Xue\u0027er was so furious that her entire body was trembling. She had never been the best at squabbling or bickering... how could she out-talk the master of these arts, Zhou Weiqing! Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \"How about this, if I come down now and am still able to defeat you... you will no longer interfere between me, Fei\u0027er and Bing\u0027er in the future. How about that?\" \"Fine. But if you lose, then I want your life.\" Shangguan Xue\u0027er said savagely. Zhou Weiqing started momentarily before saying with an aggrieved and wronged tone: \"No need to be so savage right? Furthermore, such betting terms are totally unfair! If I win, I only get your agreement not to be involved in Bing\u0027er and Fei\u0027er\u0027s relationship with me, but if I lose, I will have to die? How could I possibly agree with such terms?\" Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-22-chapter-185-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis] In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
