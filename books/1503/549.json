(2) The important part about the beauty of the Boundless Infinitum Set was not its looks, but in its complicated intricacy. For example, just her shoulder pauldrons alone had six layers of tattoos and inscriptions, and even as she moved, the equipment seemed to give off a strange aura. In the middle of the Heart Mirror area of the Consolidated chestplate, there was a huge gemstone embedded. Although the gemstone was current dark-gold in colour, there seemed to be a layer of mist deep within it, glowing and floating about. The shoulder pauldrons extended down into bracers and all the way down to her fingers, showing the beautiful curvature of her arms. Without question, the shoulder pauldrons and bracers were a single piece, only taking up a single ‘slot’ of equipment. Seven pieces of Consolidated Equipment, all God Tier, all part of a Legendary Set. Furthermore, the one wearing it was Shangguan Xue’er, and in that instant Zhou Weiqing sensed that she was even more dangerous than Gu Yingbing. This time, Shangguan Xue’er did not continue attacking Zhou Weiqing, instead floating back down onto the ground and closing her eyes. Just as her eyes closed, a terrifying and ferocious pressure grew, causing Zhou Weiqing to step back subconsciously. One had to know that currently Zhou Weiqing was in his Dragon-Tiger Transformation, and yet he had still been forced to move a step back. From that alone, one could imagine how intense and terrifying that pressure was. Even when he was facing the Heavenly King Stage Heavenly Beasts, such a thing had not occurred. The pressure that Shangguan Xue’er brought to Zhou Weiqing was not from any bloodline, but from her own energy and aura. The current Shangguan Xue’er, although she was standing there with her eyes closed, the feeling she gave Zhou Weiqing was like a naked blade unsheathed and ready to kill. That pressure was like the manifestation of her sword intent. By this point, Zhou Weiqing had seen his share of powerhouses, even top quality ones like Long Shiya and Xue AoTian. Instantly, he made the judgement that Shangguan Xue’er was highly versed in swordsmanship, just like how Shangguan Fei’er had fully focused on close combat. Compared to Shangguan Xue’er, the feeling Shangguan Fei’er gave was dangerous but not as lethal. On the other hand, Shangguan Xue’er gave him the feeling of violence bottled up. Once she unleashed her attack, it was definitely going to be unbelievably terrifying, far beyond what Shangguan Fei’er could unleash. Who said that Gu Yingbing was the top in the entire young generation? Let him try and fight against Shangguan Xue’er with her Boundless Infinitum Set. Perhaps with the gap between seven-Jeweled and nine-Jeweled, she might not be able to match him fully yet, but do not forget she still had the Heaven’s Expanse Palace behind her! Once Shangguan Xue’er reached the eight-Jeweled stage and gained her eighth piece of the Boundless Infinitum Set, at least fully completing her leg armour… Zhou Weiqing was entirely certain that Gu Yingbing would no longer be a match for her then. Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing suddenly remembered how Shangguan Xue’er had originally told him - if he wanted to marry her sister, he would have to first defeat her! Forcefully pushing down his guilt and apologetic feeling, Zhou Weiqing decided to take this opportunity to see how powerful this Boundless Infinitum Set and Shangguan Xue’er were. To any Heavenly Jewel Master, having a powerful opponent was definitely not a bad thing. With Zhou Weiqing’s experience in cultivation, it was often that a Heavenly Jewel Master’s improvement was much easier when facing powerful stress and opposition, only then were they able to draw out their potential. Just like this trip of his to the Heavenly Snow Mountain. When he had first ascended the Heavenly Snow Mountain, he had only just broken through to the six-Jeweled stage. However, after all the events and stress he had suffered on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, even almost facing death, he could clearly sense that not only was his grasp on the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation far stronger, even his cultivation speed had risen, and his understanding towards the Heavenly Xu Energy stage had also improved drastically. Originally, according to normal speed, that was a progress that should have taken him at least half a year or more. This was the benefit of facing such pressure (and surviving). The instant that Shangguan Xue’er had closed her yes, she was fully treating Zhou Weiqing like an enemy. For survival’s sake, also for the pressure, Zhou Weiqing had to focus all his spirit to deal with it. The Six Elemental Jewels at his feet quickly formed the hexagon formation, and around his body, the six Attribute Heavenly Energies spun around, giving Zhou Weiqing the sensation that he was able to control everything around him. On the Heavenly Snow Mountain, he did not have a chance to fully use the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation to its full potential. Facing the Lion King Gu Site, what he used most was his own judgement, strategizing and planning, as well as making use of Gu Site’s underestimation to gain a huge advantage in one fell swoop. However, facing Shangguan Xue’er at this moment, the pressure on him was even greater than when he had been facing Gu Site. After all, at that time, Gu Site had his cultivation level restricted and wasn\u0027t able to use his Consolidated Equipment at all. Furthermore, there was the difference in mindset between the two now... How could both be compared then? The wings behind his back spread open slowly once again. If anyone else was here, they would be able to sense the thick and heavy various Attribute Heavenly Energy that was gathering crazily towards Zhou Weiqing and into him. In this regard, he was beyond Shangguan Xue’er. With the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, his Dragon-Tiger Transformation and the Immortal Deity Technique, even for Shangguan Xue’er with her Boundless Infinitum Set, she was far from being a match for Zhou Weiqing in terms of drawing in atmospheric Heavenly Energy. Of course, although Shangguan Xue’er’s Heavenly Energy regeneration might not be fast, the sword intent she had around her continued growing crazily. The snow white Boundless Infinitum Sword became brighter and brighter. In Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, there was no longer Shangguan Xue’er, only the sword. The two of them faced off just like that. Shangguan Xue’er’s original messed up clothes, or lack thereof, were now totally covered. Only the left leg that was not covered by greaves, but at least her pants had not been removed by Zhou Weiqing. Zhou Weiqing subconsciously eyed her left leg, and somehow his thoughts wandered back to the soft skin, and his heart heated up suddenly. In that instant, Shangguan Xue’er made her move. Shangguan Xue’er’s senses were all locked onto Zhou Weiqing’s body. Though she was using swordsmanship, hers was not the speed/agility focused route, instead focusing on power, range, pressure, inertia and momentum. Zhou Weiqing’s emotional fluctuations were all within her sword intent. As soon as she detected a slight fluctuation, she instantly seized the opportunity and attacked. Sword and Body as one. Flashes of light flew out of the snow white sword at an insane pace. Yet, at the same instant, Zhou Weiqing could actually only see a single point of the snow-white light. Shangguan Xue’er’s entire sword intent was locked onto Zhou Weiqing, but at the same time, how could his attention not be on hers? Just as Shangguan Xue’er launched her attack, Zhou Weiqing had also seen some of the profound secrets behind her swordsplay, but that discovery did not let Zhou Weiqing feel a bit relaxed at all. Instead, he was even more stunned. All around that huge gemstone of the Heart Mirror of Shangguan Xue’er’s breastplate, there were twelve grooves. At this point, seven of the twelve grooves were set with the seven Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewels of Shangguan Xue’er. From Shangguan Fei’er, Zhou Weiqing had learned some news about Shangguan Xue’er and her powers. After all, he knew that he would have to challenge her sooner or later. Shangguan Xue’er’s Elemental Jewel was Four Attributes. Water, Fire, Earth, Wind. Although she was not as ‘disgusting’ as Zhou Weiqing or the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor with their six Attributes, she was already considered an ultimate talent and genius. Even She had even one more Attribute than Shangguan Tianyang. Currently, her seven Elemental Jewels were embedded in her chestplate, which meant that she was actually giving up on using all her Stored Skills. Or perhaps more accurately, ever since Shangguan Xue’er had started cultivating, she did not Store any Skills. All of her training was focused on the Boundless Infinitum Sword in her hand. This was an extreme form of training, chasing nothing but the purest form of swordsmanship. This training method was something that Shangguan Xue’er had come up with herself. After she had Awoken her Heavenly Jewels, after she had gained her first piece of Consolidated Equipment - the Boundless Infinitum Sword, she had come up with the idea and resolution. Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue had both tried to persuade her against such a training method. After all, for a Heavenly Jewel Master to totally ignore Storing Skills, it was totally against conventional thinking. However, Shangguan Xue’er continued on her own path, resolutely sticking to her own decision. Even at such a young age, the only concession she would make was to say that it was only temporary. As time went by and Shangguan Xue’er’s cultivation level grew stronger... by the age of ten she had already learned and mastered all the top sword mastery skills in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. On her own, she came up with the Dao of Swordsmanship. In the next few years, the new and immature sword intent of hers was slowly shaped into her own creation, and it grew stronger and stronger. By the time she reached the six-Jeweled stage, no one tried to persuade her to give up this unconventional cultivation method. That was because the swordsmanship of the six-Jeweled Shangguan Xue’er was already at a height that shocked even Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue! Not a single Stored Skill was required, and in her heart, there was only her sword intent. With the heart and path of the sword clear, her sword intent could destroy any Skill. This was Shangguan Xue’er’s unique cultivation path. In embedding all her Elemental Jewels around that massive gemstone in her chestplate, it was not to activate any imbued Skills of the Boundless Infinitum Set. Instead, it was to simply provide her with more Heavenly Energy, fusing it all into her sword. For her swordsmanship, she had even given up the powerful imbued Skills of the Boundless Infinitum Set. One could imagine how persistent and resolute she was towards her swordcraft. No matter if it were any ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master, if one focused on one thing to bring it to an extreme, it would bring a massive amount of power. A good example would be the Ultimate Defense Heavenly Jewel Master like Lin TianAo. Let alone Shangguan Xue’er, with such immense talent and the Boundless Infinitum Set! It could be said that Shangguan Xue’er was the total opposite of Zhou Weiqing. Instead of having so many different powers of so many different ranges, Shangguan Xue’er only had one single power. Her Sword. At this very moment, when Shangguan Xue’er entered a state where her Body and Sword were as One, pointing towards Zhou Weiqing, he could only feel as if even his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was being slowed down. Just in an instant, that single flash of white light appeared right in front of him. It was clear - Shangguan Xue’er’s intense and violent sword intent did not dissipate or scatter, fully focused on a single tiny point. Zhou Weiqing’s expression changed. Shangguan Xue’er’s strength had greatly surpassed all of his expectations. The sheer terrifying power of that swordsmanship technique... he felt that even three Shangguan Fei’er’s added together was not even equal to it! Instantly, the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set appeared around him. Five bouts of brilliant dark-gold light; five layers of protective shields, blocking in front of Zhou Weiqing. Normally speaking, Shangguan Xue’er’s cultivation level was not that far above Zhou Weiqing’s, and her attacks should not be able to break past his Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura.
