He suddenly realized he should not have gone through the Astral Feedback for those last few Heavenly Kings and the Third Grand Elder’s Heavenly Core Nuclei. That was because he had already previously reached the Max Level Heavenly King Stage. Now that he had gained the Astral Feedback from another Heavenly Emperor and seven Heavenly Kings, in that instant it had pushed his cultivation stage to the next level… the Heavenly Emperor. Indeed, even though Zhou Weiqing’s Soul was still critically injured, his cultivation base was about to raise to the Heavenly Emperor stage. Under normal circumstances, raising to the Heavenly Emperor stage was naturally a great thing. With the Astral Saint Energy reaching the next level, its strength and power could only be known after Zhou Weiqing tested it, but it was undoubtedly on another level. Alas, in his current situation, it was extremely dangerous. No matter breaking through from the nine Jeweled stage to the Heavenly King stage, or from the Heavenly King Stage to the Heavenly Emperor stage, those were no longer just a simple matter of a rise in cultivation base, nor was it as simple as a change in the Heavenly Core Nucleus. Instead, it was a total raising, from inside-out, from head to tail, from soul to body, from meridians, internal organs to bones. In the process of this ‘leveling up’, although the pain that one had to endure wasn’t that strong, it was after all a subliminal raising process, and if one’s soul was injured during this period, that posed a danger of the soul breaking down and being destroyed! What should I do? At this time, Zhou Weiqing was somewhat at a loss. He had never been in such a situation before, hence it was only normal that he did not know how to deal with it. The Astral Feedback could not be taken back. His body had already started to undergo some changes. Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue had been observing Zhou Weiqing. From their point of view, the golden light on Zhou Weiqing’s body had started becoming brighter and more intense after receiving the Astral Feedback. A layer of faint red appeared within the bright golden light; they merged together to form an even more magnificent reddish gold. The aura that he emitted had become more and more overwhelming. He was about to rank up again?! Entering the Heavenly Emperor stage? Both Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue stared in shock. After all, when the fight first started, Zhou Weiqing had only been at the High Level Heavenly King stage, and at the end of this fight, he was actually raising to the Heavenly Emperor stage. In their cases, they had taken several dozen years to actually enter the Heavenly Emperor stage, and Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation speed was truly toppling everything they knew about Heavenly Jewel Masters. “No, that’s not right. There is something wrong with his situation now.” Naturally, Long Shiya was far more familiar with his precious disciple than Wu Yunyue was, and he quickly realised the changes in Zhou Weiqing. Currently, although Zhou Weiqing was in the process of ranking up, his face was pale and ashen, and his body was trembling violently. The crimson gold glow that he was emitting as he hovered in midair was extremely unstable, giving the impression that it could break down at any time. This was definitely not the normal situation that would occur when a Heavenly King was rising to become a Heavenly Emperor. Long Shiya’s expression instantly changed. To him, the importance of his precious disciple was far above killing off all of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses. Vaguely, Long Shiya could also guess that Zhou Weiqing must have had encountered some problems during the fight with the First Elder previously, even though he was not sure of the exact details, as there were wounds on his body. Additionally, if a Heavenly Jewel Master were to forcefully evolve despite being heavily injured, it could bring about a devastating catastrophe. What pained Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor the most was that under such circumstances, he had no way of helping Zhou Weiqing at all. If Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base was lower, for example, breaking through to the Seventh Jewel cultivation base from a Sixth Jewel cultivation base, Long Shiya would still be able to help him. However, the current Zhou Weiqing was about to advance to a Heavenly Emperor, with Astral Saint Energy. Under such circumstances, Long Shiya was unable to do anything for Zhou Weiqing even if he searched his soul. The evolution of Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base could very well become an incomparably formidable existence. If he were to interfere with this process, not only would it accelerate the crisis, he could also receive a backlash from his Astral Saint Energy. Just as Long Shiya was pale with shock and was feeling extremely impatient, from afar, two sets of figures flashed from the sky like lightning. The two figures were extremely fast, and they seemed to be connected to each other. An enormous pair of greenish golden wings flapped continuously and very soon, they had arrived above the battlefield. “Who’s that?” Wu Yunyue exclaimed. He was about to flare up but Long Shiya held him back. “Wait, everyone stop. They’re on our side, they are here to help Weiqing breakthrough. Don’t act rashly.” Long Shiya’s words quickly allowed everything to calm down. The two figures swiftly reached Zhou Weiqing’s side, and the owner of the two giant green wings abruptly flung the other person in its arms towards Zhou Weiqing. Strangely speaking, the powerful gold Saint Energy around Zhou Weiqing did not seem to have the slightest rejection or aversion to these two newcomers. The one who had been flung out was a young lady, and as she flew out, her white gown billowed in the air, causing her to look like a celestial fairy descending from the heavens. In a flash, she had appeared before Zhou Weiqing. Without any hesitation, she spread her arms open and put her arms around Zhou Weiqing’s neck, hugging him tightly. At the same time, she lifted her head and kissed him on the lips. The two women who arrived abruptly were naturally Shangguan Bing’er and Tian’er. Even though they did not take part in the battle, they had been observing closely at the side, along with the Heavenly Bow Empire powerhouses. After the dust had settled, the loud battle noises naturally died down. However, the light from the nebula in the sky remained. At this time, Tian’er suddenly had an extremely intense feeling. She sensed that there was something amiss about Zhou Weiqing’s situation. Since they both cultivated their Saint Energy together, it was natural for their feelings and mind to be interlinked. This was especially so over a short distance as such. Thus, Tian’er got Shangguan Bing’er to send her over immediately. At the moment when Tian’er kissed Zhou Weiqing, Zhou Weiqing’s body trembled even more vigorously. However in the next moment, both his hands were placed around Tian’er’s slender waist; immense reddish golden light rays directly rotated around the both of them, so strong that even Shangguan Bing’er was swept along. Naturally, the Astral Saint Energy would not harm the two women, as their bodies were filled with Saint Energy. Even though they were not as strong as Zhou Weiqing, the two types of energy had the same source and were both creation energy, hence, they would not harm one another. Shangguan Bing’er had gotten used to cultivating with Zhou Weiqing during their journey to Xuantian Continent. Naturally, she did not want to let such a good opportunity slip by. She spread her wings open and kept her body hovering in the air while at the same time sensing the strong Astral Saint Energy in her surroundings, before she started cultivating. On the other side, it was a different situation with Tian’er and Zhou Weiqing. Almost without any hesitation, Zhou Weiqing channeled the massive Astral Saint Energy, that was about to be upgraded to Heavenly Emperor-level, into Tian’er’s body. Receiving such massive amount of energy from Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er’s body immediately turned into a shade of reddish gold. Zhou Weiqing started losing consciousness. Furthermore, he was currently being led by Tian’er - he completely had no clue as for whether it would hurt the baby in Tian’er’s belly by doing so. He had already lost the ability to judge; he was subconsciously looking for an outlet to let off vent. Something even stranger happened next. As Tian’er’s body turned into a shade of reddish gold, her belly also lit up. A layer of strange white sheen appeared on her belly. It was a tiny ball of light, in the form of pure white. When the white appeared, Zhou Weiqing’s strong and powerful Astral Saint Energy had actually lost its luster. All the reddish golden colors almost seemed to become more harmonious in an instant. They no longer circled around Zhou Weiqing - instead, they started circling around the tiny ball of white light. As the huge amount of upgraded Saint Energy left his body, Zhou Weiqing finally heaved a sigh of relief. His soul had also started to stabilize again. All he needed right now was time to restore his soul, which was not a difficult process. As he subconsciously opened his eyes, Zhou Weiqing saw Tian’er, who was being kissed by him. Suddenly, his body shook vigorously and his eyes were filled with shock and pain. How could I have channeled that massive amount of energy into Tian’er’s body? If Tian’er was not pregnant, it would have benefited her, as she would have gained her own energy from it. Since the Saint Energy was created by the both of them together, Tian’er would not reject any of it at all. However, the current situation was different - Tian’er was already pregnant; would receiving the massive amount of energy hurt the baby? If that was the case, Zhou Weiqing would definitely regret it for the rest of his life. However, Zhou Weiqing quickly realized something wasn’t right. He was surprised to discover that a special energy that made him feel comfortable, as though he had returned to the core of the universe, was continuously released by Tian’er, who was in his embrace. The energy was rather weak, but it was without a doubt a supreme one. All of the Astral Saint Energy seemed to have become its subjects, even the Astral Cloud in the skies had stopped spinning, a large amount of Astral Saint Energy descended from the sky, enveloping Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er and Shangguan Bing’er within it. Wasn’t that Astral Energy the same as Astral Feedback energy? However, Zhou Weiqing did not use the Heavenly Core Nucleus to conduct the Astral Feedback this time! Those energy were completely bestowed to them from countless stars in the sky. The gentle energy first surrounded Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, circling around them. Under the surge of Astral Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing’s broken soul recovered to its normal state in an instant. Zhou Weiqing realized that the Saint Energy was different from the Astral Feedback that he had released earlier. Within the golden star light, there was a slight tinge of white. Although the white was very, very faint, it allowed his soul to be successfully restored at a rapid pace. Otherwise, Zhou Weiqing might not necessarily have discovered the existence of that special energy. Immediately after, the reddish golden energy that he had previously channeled into Tian’er’s body had poured back out and injected into him, causing Zhou Weiqing’s body to glow with a reddish golden light once again. Since Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s bodies were closely pressed against each other, the only person who could see the strange white glow that was emitted from Tian’er’s belly was none other than Shangguan Bing’er, who was in the sky.
