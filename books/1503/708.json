(1) A faint smile crossed Zhou Weiqing’s lips as he swept his gaze across Fei Lun, but his expression turned cold in the next instant. “Wanting to see me create God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls… you still do not have the qualification. Return and tell your Palace Master, if he wants to test my abilities, that is no problem at all. I am not a unreasonable person; since I have come here, I will definitely show my sincerity. However, do you really think that with your capabilities, you can tell whether or not I have personally created a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll? With my techniques, simply swapping out a Scroll for you to see is not difficult at all. I will give you a list of materials, go back and prepare it. I would also require your XuanTian Palace to clear a suitable place for creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, and please invite the most outstanding Consolidating Equipment Masters then. Only Consolidating Equipment Masters have the qualification to examine other Consolidating Equipment Masters. As he said that, with a flick of his wrist, a piece of white paper appeared in Zhou Weiqing’s hands. Holding up the goose feather quill which had been ready in the inn, he began writing on the paper. In a matter of moments, he had written an entire long list, inscribed with the various materials needed for creating Consolidating Ink. After he had finished writing, he passed the paper to Fei Lun and said passively: “You may leave now.” Fei Lu received the piece of white paper. Although he felt like there was something stuck in his heart from being suppressed by Zhou Weiqing’s actions, in the end he did not flare out. Without commenting on whether or not this youth was really a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, the pride and arrogance he showed was definitely that of one. From the looks of things, he seemed to be too bold and confident, as if he truly had nothing to fear. Although Fei Lun was one of the Elders of the XuanTian Palace, if Zhou Weiqing was really a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, even he dared not offend him. As part of the upper echelon of the XuanTian Palace, he still had his family, his disciples, many of whom still needed Consolidating Equipment Scrolls! “Very well, since that is the case, please wait for my return. I will report directly back to the Palace Master with your words.” After saying that, Fei Lun nodded towards Zhou Weiqing before turning to leave. As the door closed behind him, Shangguan Bing’er could no longer hold back the wide grin on her face. Just as she was about to speak, Zhou Weiqing gave her a silencing motion, using voice transference he said quietly: “Don’t say anything out loud, the walls may have ears.” Shangguan Bing’er stuck out her cute little tongue as she looked at Zhou Weiqing, her eyes brimming with thick emotions. Her Little Fatty was becoming a powerhouse who could hold his own and take responsibilities on his broad shoulders. In the XuanTian Continent, the two of them were all alone, but from the beginning until now, Zhou Weiqing had been planning everything out without showing any signs of being flustered, easily taking things as they came and dealing with it, always calm and unhurried. Looking inwardly, Shangguan Bing’er had to admit that if she had been the one in charge, she could not have possibly done as well as Zhou Weiqing. Seeing her beloved devising strategies and looking like he had everything in hand, the love in her heart only increased greatly. It was as if when she followed by his side, even if it were in the undertaking of such a dangerous quest, she felt safe and unworried. Of course, Zhou Weiqing did not truly have everything in his grasp. However, since he was young, Mu En had taught him that to be a true scoundrel and rogue, no matter what happened, he had to first believe in himself, to truly believe that he was always correct. Even if he had been exposed, never admit it. It was this mentality which had been finely groomed in, one that allowed Zhou Weiqing to survive all of these years in the Boundless Mainland, especially in his early years. More so, it had definitely helped his current self grow to such heights. Although this XuanTian Continent was a totally different world to their own, the current Zhou Weiqing was also no longer his old self. With his Saint Energy and all his various powers, he could be said to have great confidence, and more importantly; to have the strength to backup that confidence. No matter what situation he would have to face, he had sufficient certainty that he would be able to get through it, and not allow his opponents to see through things so easily. … For the entirety of the following day, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er mainly remained in their room to rest. During that period, he had also brought her out to have a walk along the streets, enjoying some of the street food and refreshments of the Heavenly City. The food of the Heavenly City was rather different from that of the Boundless Mainland. For example, the flavour of all their foods were comparatively much stronger, and they also enjoyed a lot of spicy food. Both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er had definitely enjoyed their ‘food tour’, inundating their taste buds with these different flavours. Besides that, they had also purchased some cheap but interesting handcrafted trinkets and baubles. Whenever they left their room, they would be followed, naturally with the excuse of protecting them, though both of them knew it was also to keep watch on them. Of course, these XuanTian Palace personnel did not understand why this God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master would purchase these cheap baubles that even they would spurn. Naturally, they did not know that Zhou Weiqing was buying some souvenirs for his friends and family. After all, this could be considered a totally different world, a fresh new continent; if he returned without bringing back anything, would those tough girls he had at home let him go so easily? … At last, three days after they had entered the Heavenly City, the XuanTian Palace sent someone to look for them again. Once again, it was Fei Lun. This time, Er Chun was no longer present as well, perhaps he had already returned to the W\u0027Batu City. “Master, we have already prepared the items and place you requested. Please follow me.” As soon as Fei Lun saw Zhou Weiqing, he did not waste time on small talk, directly inviting him to move out. The list of materials that Zhou Weiqing had provided had actually given the XuanTian Palace some trouble. Even though they dominated the entire XuanTian Continent, it was still not easy for them to look for so many precious materials. In truth, there were quite some differences between the XuanTian Continent and Boundless Mainland in terms of resources. Some of the more precious resources in the Boundless Mainland were more plentiful here, but at the same time, some of the relatively common resources in the Boundless Mainland were actually considered rare and precious here. Zhou Weiqing nodded towards Fei Lun, and both he and Shangguan Bing’er walked out of the inn together, hand in hand. A horse carriage was outside waiting for them. To Zhou Weiqing’s surprise, after they boarded the carriage, it did not head towards the inner city, instead moving out of the Heavenly City entirely. Of course, as the saying goes, those talented are often very bold, and Zhou Weiqing did not worry about it at all. Fei Lun had also boarded the same horse carriage as them, seated facing the young couple, and his gaze constantly landed upon Zhou Weiqing. For anyone else, if they were constantly stared at by a Heavenly King powerhouse, it would definitely not be a comfortable feeling, making them feel nervous. However, Zhou Weiqing was an exception. To him, if you liked to look, so be it. He even kissed Shangguan Bing’er’s beautiful soft cheeks a few times, giving Fei Lun a provoking glance as he did so. Naturally, Fei Lun pretended he did not see anything. In fact, through the entire journey, he did not even speak to Zhou Weiqing. The horse carriage traveled for more than two hours. Seated within, they could sense that the path they were taking was slowly sloping upwards. Although they did not draw open the curtains to look outside, Zhou Weiqing could still sense that they were moving up a hill. Furthermore, every time they traveled for a distance, they would be stopped by a large number of guards, who would look at their horse carriage before allowing them to pass. The XuanTian Palace is outside the Heavenly City? Zhou Weiqing mused to himself inwardly, though his face remained expressionless. At last, after about another hour of travel, the horse carriage finally stopped for good. Fei Lun nodded towards Zhou Weiqing, taking the lead to disembark, even helping him keep the door open as he descended. Zhou Weiqing and Bing’er took turns exiting the horse carriage, and as their feet touched solid ground once more, both their faces couldn’t help but reveal looks of surprise. The scene before them was especially beautiful and moving. They were in a valley, fresh greenery all about them, with soft green grass carpeting the ground before them. All sorts of vegetation were growing all around, some of them were even precious treasures that even Zhou Weiqing could recognize. Since they were in a valley surrounded by flowers and greenery, the faint scent of flower fragrance mixed with cool fresh air entered their noses, giving them a refreshing and energetic sensation. Just beyond the valley, Zhou Weiqing could sense more than twenty presences, with at least two Heavenly King powerhouses. One could imagine how important this place was to the XuanTian Palace in order to have such a strong guard. However, it was also extremely clear that this was not actually the XuanTian Palace itself. The entire valley could be seen in a single glance, and the situation was thus clear to him. Deeper in the valley, the only man-made objects were a little wooden cabin right in the center of the valley, as well as three log houses. At most, they could house seven or eight people in total… how could this be the Headquarters of the XuanTian Palace? Seeing the curious looks on both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er, Fei Lun explained in a solemn tone: “The two honoured God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters of our Palace usually stay here. Since Master Zhou wanted a suitable place to create the Consolidating Equipment Scroll, after some deliberation, the XuanTian Palace has decided that this would be the most suitable spot. As such, we have invited Master Zhou here. The items you have requested are also in there.” Zhou Weiqing nodded, and he was just about to step towards the cabin when he was suddenly stopped by Fei Lun, and Zhou Weiqing gave him a questioning look. With a deep and meaningful look, Fei Lun said slowly: “Master Zhou, this old man has heard of your deeds in the W\u0027Batu City. Even if Master Zhou isn’t a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master yet, just the fact that you are able to create Grandmaster Consolidating Equipment Scrolls at will… you are still an outstanding talent. It is not too late for you to regret now, but once you step into the cabin to take the test and do not pass it… it will be too late.” His meaning was extremely clear. If Zhou Weiqing admitted that he wasn’t a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master now; with all his talents, the XuanTian Palace would still place high importance upon him. However, once he actually entered the wooden cabin but failed the test; no matter how talented he was, the XuanTian Palace would not allow him to leave this place alive. Zhou Weiqing did not say anything else, smiling widely as he pushed Fei Lun’s hand aside lightly. Holding onto Shangguan Bing’er’s hand, he walked directly to the wooden cabin. Looking at his retreating back, Fei Lun’s surprise was unconcealable. He couldn’t help but think to himself: Could it be this young man was really a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master? If that was really so, then perhaps even in the entire history of the continent, of all Consolidating Equipment Masters, he would truly be a genius and prodigy amongst all prodigies! According to Fei Lun’s considerable knowledge, in the entire XuanTian Continent, the youngest God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in history was still over fifty years old. That was a legendary figure in the past. Unless… Time did not allow him to continue thinking, as Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er had almost reached the wooden cabin. In a flash, Fei Lun quickly rushed to catch up. As for the rest of the XuanTian Palace members who were around, they remained outside, none of them allowed into the deeper part of the valley. As he walked to the front of the cabin and to the door, Zhou Weiqing’s Ice Cold Perception had subtly raised to the maximum. He could clearly sense that there were two life forces in the cabin, but to his shock, he actually couldn’t sense their cultivation levels. Although they hadn’t actually met yet, his Ice Cold Perception was already at an extremely sensitive level especially with the boost from his Saint Energy. Even if it was just gossamer threads of a spider and the trail of a horse [1], he was still usually able to judge a Heavenly Jewel Master’s cultivation from this distance. Yet, he was totally unable to judge that of the two within the cabin. This could only mean one thing… the cultivation stage of the two was at least at the Max Heavenly King Stage, or even higher.
