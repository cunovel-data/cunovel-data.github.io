(3)\n That last startled exclamation drew everyone’s gaze to him, and as they looked at him curiously, Ma Qun said gravely, full of regret: “I forgot to give a loud fart before I went down…”\n Zhou Weiqing gave him a kick, sending him to the side as he scolded laughingly: “That was not what I taught you! This big bro here is not so shameless!”\n Including Tian’er, the entire Heavenly Bow Battle Team gave Zhou Weiqing a contemptuous look.\n On the stage, another figure had appeared. TianFeng stood next to TianMa, one hand on his shoulders, helping him nurse his chaotic Heavenly Energy due to his rage.\n “Calm down. The humiliation they have given us, we will pay back ten times, hundred times more. There is no point raging pointlessly now. Senior Shangguan, the third match, both of us will be the fighters.”\n Shangguan Longyin looked at Tianfeng and nodded in agreement. However, he felt his heart grip inwardly. This TianFeng was much calmer and more stable, far beyond his brother TianMa, especially that cold calculation that lay in his bones. It was clear that he was narrow minded person who would seek vengeance for any minor grievances, but one who could complete control his emotions. Such a person was far more dangerous and deadly than his strength alone could account for.\n With his brother’s help, TianMa managed to gradually calm down, his Heavenly Energy also easing up. However, the bloodshot red in his eyes did not withdraw, clearly he truly hated the entire Heavenly Bow Battle Team now.\n Shangguan Longyin said: “Dan Dun Battle Team against the Heavenly Bow Battle Team. Two versus Two. Third match. Both sides, please send your fighters up the stage.\n In a flash, two figures appeared from the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, hand in hand. Tian’er had already removed her bamboo hat, revealing her beautiful features.\n When Zhou Weiqing held her hands and they ascended the stage, instantly the phrase ‘fresh flower stuck on bull crap’ and similar phrases crossed all the rest houses.\n Looking at Zhou Weiqing, both brothers TianMa and TianFeng’s eyes contracted, a powerful killing intent released without any attempt at hiding.\n Shangguan Longyin was also secretly surprised in his heart. He knew that this next match was of utmost importance to both sides. Zhou Weiqing had used a four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master to ‘waste’ the second strongest powerhouse in the Dan Dun Battle Team, TianMa. Although that had been a loss of a match, in terms of strategy, it was a perfect victory. However, this current 2v2 match was perhaps the most critical one which would decide the outcome between both teams. After all, it was the fight between the strongest of both teams, and it would definitely be the most exciting fight of the entire Heavenly Jewel Tournament thus far. Being the judge for this match, it would not be so easy!\n “Zhou Weiqing, today I will tear you into bits!” The rage and venom that TianMa had just suppressed burst free once again, rising up as he saw Zhou Weiqing.\n Standing at Zhou Weiqing’s side, Tian’er gave a cold humph. “Aren’t you afraid of bragging so much you sprain your tongue? A mere Blood Red Hell, and you dare to be so arrogant in front of us.”\n ...\n As soon as Tian’er appeared on the stage, the entire WanShou Battle Team members subconsciously dashed out of their rest house. In this year’s Heavenly Jewel Tournament, the WanShou Empire had definitely sent an elite team as well, and since they were mostly from the Heavenly Snow Mountain, how could they not recognize their Young Miss? However, at this point, it was clearly not the time or place to greet her.\n At the head, a youth who was clearly the leader couldn’t help but mutter to himself: “Now, it looks like that Dan Dun Battle Team will be in trouble after all.”\n At his side, another youth asked curiously: “Boss, didn’t you just say earlier that the Heavenly Bow Battle Team would not be a match for the Dan Dun Battle Team? Young Miss might be powerful, but she is just alone. Her cultivation level may not even be a match for the TianFeng and TianMa brothers right?”\n “Zhou Weiqing… that name… don’t you all find it familiar at all? Use your brains, why would the Young Miss actually appear here? Haven’t you forgotten what happened on the Heavenly Snow Mountain?”\n Hearing his words, the entire WanShou Battle Team members’ jaws dropped. “He… he is that fellow who came to steal the bride?”\n The leader sighed and said: “Indeed! Even Senior Brother Gu was defeated by him… hmph, do you think the brothers TianFeng and TianMa can be compared to Senior Brother Gu? So, the truly dangerous one is not Young Miss, but him. Watch carefully and learn, this will be a true fight between top powerhouses. We are indeed very lucky not to meet the Heavenly Bow Battle Team in the top eight.” Clearly, he had already affirmed his belief on who the final team ascending to the top eight would be.\n ...\n On the stage, Shangguan Longyin’s expression grew bleak. “Enough, both teams, there is no point fighting with words. Both sides, introduce yourselves.”\n “Heavenly Bow Battle Team, Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er.”\n “Dan Dun Battle Team, TianFeng, TianMa.”\n Shangguan Longyin swept his gaze across all four of them, before saying: “Know your limits. This is the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, not a life and death fight. Alright, fight, begin.”\n With both sides confronting each other with daggers drawn and sabres rattling, in such an aggressive manner, he couldn’t help but remind in a line. Of course, he did not have any goodwill towards the Dan Dun Battle Team. However, he did not want to see Zhou Weiqing suffer any loss. Even for him, he did not have a lot of hopes for Zhou Weiqing’s success. After all, Zhou Weiqing had just fought against Shen Little Demon, and to unleash that strange Silver Emperor, it should have taken quite a toll on him. The brothers TianFeng and TianMa were not only fresh, but also stronger than Shen Little Demon. Clearly, it would not be an easy fight at all.\n Along with Shangguan Longyin’s proclamation, the aura and presence that both sides had been holding in and building up smashed into each other instantly. Aura and presence was invisible and intangible, but it could put immense pressure on an opponent’s spirit.\n If it came to a clash of auras, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er would definitely be able to laugh to the end. Previously, on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, Zhou Weiqing had been able to clash auras with a Heavenly Emperor stage Heavenly Beast with the bloodline pressure. This was a type of clash of auras.\n The two brothers TianFeng and TianMa instantly felt a boundless and terrifying pressure, filled with noble grace and royal presence pushing down upon them from Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er. Vaguely, they sensed one black, one white, two massive tigers pouncing towards them.\n In that instant, both sides unleashed their Heavenly Jewels. Zhou Weiqing had six sets of Jewels, actually ending up the lowest of the four. Tian’er was at seven-Jewels, as was TianMa. However, when TianFeng released his Heavenly Jewels, even Zhou Weiqing’s pupils narrowed in surprise. He was at the eight-Jeweled stage!\n Indeed, TianFeng had released eight pairs of Heavenly Jewels. His Physical Jewels were the Icy Jade of the Strength Attribute, while his Elemental Jewels were also the Alexandrite Jewels of Dual Attributes. Powerful Heavenly Energy mixed into their auras, and the clash resumed.\n Both sides did not take action instantly; in this clash of auras, whoever took action first meant their aura and pressure was already at the disadvantage. This would not be a good sign. All of the four were top powerhouses in the younger generation, and they were all able to defeat enemies above their cultivation level. Naturally, they knew very well the advantage in moving first. However, that had to be in unison with a suppression of aura to be of proper use, rather than the reverse.\n Anyone could clearly see that from the aura that rose above the brothers TianFeng and TianMa, there was a faint gold-red light of Fire and Light, giving the audience a sensation like they were the rising sun in the skies.\n On the other side, TIan’er gave forth a brilliant gold, along with a swirling purple. The beautiful purple eyes of hers were also glowing brightly.\n The light around Zhou Weiqing was the strangest, six colours rising in unison, swirling around his body as they rose up. In terms of attributes, it was without question that Zhou Weiqing was the strongest amongst the four.\n Very quickly, the clash of aura and pressure showed the victor. Zhou Weiqing had the Dragon and Tiger bloodlines, while Tian’er had the pure Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline. As both of them held hands, the four Saint Attributes were present as well. Although their overall cultivation levels and Heavenly Energy was lower, their aura and presence was far superior to their enemies.\n TianFeng and TianMa’s expressions turned grave. When Tian’er released her aura, they instantly recognized where she was from. However, at this point, it was too late to say anything, and it was more important to defeat their enemies.\n By now, all of the Battle Team members had walked out of their respective rest houses. Towards this major battle in front of them, they paid close attention, placing high importance upon it. The brothers TianFeng and TianMa were definitely shocking, but at the same time, this Heavenly Bow Battle Team had yet another hidden seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, with such powerful Attributes as well. They were equally shocking indeed. Besides the ZhongTian Battle Team who already knew of them beforehand, and the WanShou Battle Team who recognized them, all of the other teams were just filled with surprise and shock.\n This was destined to be a clash of the top! Originally, those who had looked down upon the Heavenly Bow Battle Team currently had very complicated feelings in their hearts.\n Facing the terrifying bloodline powers and the suppression of their enemies’ aura, both TianFeng and TianMa began breathing heavily. TianFeng withdrew his gaze, and abruptly, he took a half step forward, the gold-red in his eyes changing suddenly as the purple of the Destruction Attribute appeared.\n TianMa and TianFeng could be said to be connected on a certain level. As soon as TianFeng activated his Destruction Attribute, TianMa’s eyes also flashed in a similar fashion. The powerful Destructive aura gave their highly suppressed auras a huge boost; though it wasn’t sufficient to turn to tides and allow them to suppress Zhou Weiqing and TIan’er, at least they were able to hold on.\n Despite that, the two brothers were still forced to make the first move, and their Consolidated Equipment appeared.\n Flashes of dark gold lit up around them one by one, as the light shield representing the God Tier Consolidated Equipment sprang up individually, causing the entire audience to erupt in surprise.\n It had to be known, normally it was extremely difficult to even see a single God Tier Consolidated Equipment, enough to shock anyone. However, in that series of bright flashes, the two brothers had unleashed a total of fifteen dark-gold light shields!\n Besides Legendary Sets, there was no other explanation for them having so many high level Consolidated Equipment.\n That was a hideous and savage scale armour. Indeed, hideous and savage was a very apt description. Their armour was clearly not fully completed yet, as the Consolidated Equipment was still the dark-gold colour that represented an incomplete Legendary set. Almost the entire armour was covered with sharp spikes, and on the chest area, there was a strange symbol of a crab. Even their helmets, both sides of them had four sharp spikes twisting about, as if the eight legs of a crab. The two of them had exactly the same Consolidated Equipment, fifteen God Tier Consolidated Equipment in total, and instantly their aura exploded forth in a massive boost, not only regaining all lost ground, but actually starting to be the suppressor instead.\n In terms of Consolidated Equipment, Zhou Weiqing could be said to be extremely knowledgeable and experienced already. As soon as both sides faced off, he could clearly sense that this TianFeng, in terms of cultivation level and overall combat prowess, was perhaps already a match for the Lion Prince Gu Yingbing. As one of the top in the Great Saint Lands younger generation, he was definitely top quality.\n Of course, that did not mean that Tian’er, Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er could not compare to Gu Yingbing or this TianFeng. However, Tian’er, Shangguan Xue’er and the other girls were still much younger, far from reaching thirty years old. As a result, it was normal for them to have some gap in cultivation levels for now.\n No matter Shen Little Demon, TianFeng or TianMa, they all had the Destruction Attribute. It was clear that this Destruction Attribute was not inborn, but somehow cultivated by them in recent times.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-24-chapter-220-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
