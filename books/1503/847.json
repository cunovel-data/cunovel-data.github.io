{"id":52021,"no":847,"title":"Chapter 288 - The Saint Land - The Peerless Sect (3)","content":"Upon seeing Zhou Weiqing, the Passion Valley Lord Huang Xingyun furrowed his brows. On the other hand, the Blood Red Hell Hell Lord Fen Tian’s eyes lit up. Even though it was his first time meeting Zhou Weiqing, he had heard his name several times before. Gu Yingbing’s eyes looked dimmed, “You joined the Heaven’s Expanse Palace?” Shangguan Tianyang looked at Zhou Weiqing and said, “Our Heaven’s Expanse Palace is only but a tiny temple, there is no space for a God like him.” He didn’t join the Heaven’s Expanse Palace? Gu Yingbing immediately looked shocked; even the Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian was shocked too. From what they recalled, Zhou Weiqing was very closely connected to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Even though in the eyes of the leaders of the Saint Lands, they had never regarded Zhou Weiqing as their equal. However, since they had heard of Zhou Weiqing’s name, clearly, they had heard about everything that Zhou Weiqing had accomplished. At least, in their hearts, Zhou Weiqing was considered as the strongest individual amongst the cultivators in the younger generation. Disregarding everything he had done, just the fact that he had the guts to go to the Heavenly Snow Mountain to capture his bride, as well as successfully defeating Gu Yingbing before kidnapping the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian’s daughter, alone was something that peers of his age was unable to do. After that, Zhou Weiqing depended on himself and established the Peerless Sect with the help of the Zhong Tian Empire, successfully defeating the Bai Da and Kalise Empire. Not only did he save his father and the empire, he also managed to vanquish the Kalise Empire at the same time. It could be said that it was the Heavenly Bow Empire that helped the Zhong Tian Empire to build up their defensive line on the west side, which managed to diminish and slow down the offensive powers of the allied armies of the Bai Da and Dan Dun Empire, postponing any attacks till after the end of the Grand Tournament. Hence, both Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian were extremely curious with regards to this young man before their eyes, that they were meeting for the very first time - particularly Fen Tian, as the Blood Red Hell had lost several of its powerhouses to the Heavenly Bow Empire. None of them made it back alive. According to his speculations, Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya might be powerful, but without the backing of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, which secretly sent a troop of powerhouses to help them, the tiny Heavenly Bow Empire would not be able to detain the four elders of the Blood Red Hell, as well as the assassins that he dispatched. Thus, when Shangguan Tianyang expressed that Zhou Weiqing was not a member of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, they could not help but be taken aback. The only person who seemed unaffected by the news was Xue AoTian. He said in a deep voice, “Since you are not representing the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, naturally, you must be representing the Heavenly Demon Sect. Is that right?” Zhou Weiqing shook his head and replied, “Just like what the Hell Lord Fen Tian mentioned earlier, the Heavenly Demon Sect no longer exists on the Mainland. I am not representing them either.” Gu Yingbing said in a low voice, “Zhou Weiqing, how dare you speak in such a rude manner in front of so many elders? I might have lost to you in the previous battle, but today, I want to challenge you once more and fight to the death.” As he spoke, he had already stepped out of the crowd and walked up to him. Oddly, nobody tried to block him or yell at him to stop. It seemed as though everyone wanted to see how powerful Zhou Weiqing was. Zhou Weiqing sighed softly, “Brother Gu, I truly admire your perseverance and potential. Within a short couple of years, you managed to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly King Stage on your own. I am indeed surprised. From the looks of it, the defeat became your greatest motivation. Without Tian’er’s existence, perhaps we would have become friends. Today is the day of the Grand Tournament, we should upstage the event. We should follow the rules of the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands.” Gu Yingbing bellowed, “What makes you think you’re qualified to join the Grand Tournament?” A ray of light flashed across Zhou Weiqing’s eyes. In an instant, a concise and lofty aura erupted from his body. The initial mischievous look in his eyes became grave, and powerful rays of light radiated from his eyes. “I am the Sect Leader of the Peerless Sect, one of the five Great Saint Lands.” “The Peerless Sect? Sect Leader?” Gu Yingbing stared dumbfoundedly at Zhou Weiqing. Amongst the people present, some of them looked unaffected, whereas a majority of them had a strange look on their faces. How did a Saint Land come into existence? It was the supreme land of Heavenly Jewel Masters. The other four Great Saint Lands had a legacy of more than a thousand years, in order to reach their current scale today. On the day of the Grand Tournament, a young man actually appeared out of nowhere, claiming that he himself was a Sect Leader, and that he had established the Peerless Sect, a Saint Land. What was the meaning of this? It was practically the biggest joke ever. After Gu Yingbing was in shock for a moment, he wore a strange expression on his face, “Zhou Weiqing, did you become a retard? You claimed that you have established a Saint Land? Based on what, exactly?” Zhou Weiqing replied indifferently, “Let me ask you instead, on what basis did all the other four Great Saint Lands call themselves a Saint Land?” Gu Yingbing replied without any hesitation, “Of course it is based on power. It is worthy to be called a Saint Land when it possesses great power.” Zhou Weiqing smiled, “Then naturally, I am basing it on power as well.” “Just with you alone?” Gu Yingbing was in disbelief. At this moment, he thought that Zhou Weiqing went berserk. Zhou Weiqing shook his head, “No, of course not with me alone.” As he spoke, he walked over to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s powerhouses. In the next moment, a layer of dazzling silver light emitted from his chest. The dazzling radiance was full of extremely powerful Spatial Attribute energy ripples. It transformed into a silver halo that immediately expanded. The moment they sensed the overbearing Spatial Attribute energy, everyone present, including Shangguan Tianyang and Xue AoTian, were shocked. The gazes they shot Zhou Weiqing was full of shock too. Seeing his arrival, all of them knew that Zhou Weiqing would bring the Peerless Sect along with him. However, when they saw that Zhou Weiqing was alone, they were extremely puzzled. And at this moment, Zhou Weiqing was emitting such strong Spatial Attribute energy ripples, causing them to be further taken aback. Even though Zhou Weiqing possessed the Spatial Attribute, it was not his main attribute! Very soon, all the powerhouses present, who were at least of the Heavenly Emperor Stage, discovered something peculiar. The silver light was not emitted by Zhou Weiqing himself. It was being released from a gem-like item at the top of his chest. Because the light rays were too strong, his clothes could no longer conceal its shape. What was he doing? Nobody knew what Zhou Weiqing was up to. However, everybody present was a powerhouse - they were able to sense that the silver light emitted by Zhou Weiqing was filled with extremely powerful energy ripples. Nonetheless, it was not offensive in nature. At the same time, they still did not regard a young man like Zhou Weiqing as a threat. The silver halo that Zhou Weiqing emitted was about 20 meters in diameter. Along with the dazzling silver light, gradually, a series of silhouettes appeared next to him. Teleportation? Or mass teleportation? Upon seeing that, even Xue AoTian could not help but to gasp in shock. Even though amongst the several powerhouses present, there was a large number of them that possessed the Spatial Attribute, none of them could perform a mass teleportation. Even a Heavenly Jewel Master of the Heavenly God Stage might not necessarily be able to achieve that! Even though the powerhouses of the four Great Saint Lands were highly experienced and knowledgeable, it was their first time seeing the mass teleportation technique. It could be said that the appearance of the Peerless Sect had shocked everyone who was present. The individuals who initially thought that Zhou Weiqing was crazy had become a lot more vigilant at this moment. There were quite a number of figures that appeared next to Zhou Weiqing. Even though they were not as many compared to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace or the Blood Red Hell, there were at least several dozens of them. Their headcount was more or less similar to the Passion Valley, or perhaps slightly higher. The silver light vanished, and these figures could be clearly seen. Just like the long blue robe worn by Zhou Weiqing, these people were also wearing the same long blue robe. Hence, the colors representing the five Great Saint Lands could clearly be seen. The Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had similar colors - the latter was donned in milky white, while the former was donned in snowy white. The Passion Valley powerhouses were dressed in yellow; the Blood Red Hell was dressed in dark red, while the Peerless Sect was decked in blue, like the color of the blue sky. Looking at the people who emerged next to Zhou Weiqing, the first person to furrow his brows was the Hell Lord Fen Tian of the Blood Red Hell. This was because he recognized the two people who were standing next to Zhou Weiqing. Or rather, a majority of the powerhouses of the other four Great Saint Lands recognized them as well. Standing to the left of Zhou Weiqing was none other than the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, Long Shiya, or otherwise known as the first Heavenly God. Standing to the right of Zhou Weiqing was the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Demon Sect, the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue. The two of them actually showed up at the same time via Spatial Teleportation. It was impossible for everyone present to remain calm and unaffected. Bewildered gazes fell upon the powerhouses of the Peerless Sect, who were standing behind Zhou Weiqing, Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue. They were the three Shangguan sisters, Tian’er, Little Witch Wu Yuehan, as well as the six Heavenly Kings of the Heavenly Demon Sect. Behind them were some people who were also wearing the long blue robe, but their bodies were covered in cloaks - even their heads were covered, hence it was impossible to make out their faces. They looked rather similar to the people of the Blood Red Hell. They concealed their identities in the same way; it was impossible to sense any energy ripples from their bodies and hence, it was unable to detect their cultivation base. The silver light had completely vanished. The Peerless Sect had engaged in such a special technique to make their appearance, and thus inevitably diminished the tense atmosphere. Fen Tian had a cold look in his eyes, “Wu Yunyue, you’re surprisingly not dead yet. Since when did the Heavenly Demon Sect change its name? It’s no wonder that your disciple dared to announce that the Heavenly Demon Sect no longer exists.” Upon seeing Fen Tian, Wu Yunyue’s eyes went red, as though he had met his mortal enemy. His face darkened, looking especially horrifying, “Fen Tian, I will fight you to the death today. The Sect Leader is right, the Heavenly Demon Sect no longer exists. There is only the Peerless Sect. Sect Leader Zhou is the leader overseeing the peerless Sect, and I am his deputy.” Wu Yunyue’s words caused the powerhouses of the other Great Saint Lands to be unable to remain quiet. They started discussing amongst themselves.
