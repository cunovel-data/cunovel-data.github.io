{"id":52061,"no":887,"title":"Chapter 302 - The Resentment Space (3)","content":"“At the start, we still had the ability to destroy him if we joined forces. However, the Lord of the Nether was extremely cunning - he drilled a hole underground in the space he was in. As a result, our ancestors could not locate him for a long period of time. When they had found him again, he had already become much more powerful - as powerful as the Fen Tian you dealt with earlier. At that time, the Saint Attribute did not exist. The Sidhe Empress at that time had thoroughly drained herself in order to weaken him significantly. Nonetheless, she was unable to kill him. The Dragon Emperor put in place a seal, together with the other Dragon powerhouses, and managed to seal him with much difficulty, such that he was unable to absorb any more resentment from the external world.”\n After hearing that, Zhou Weiqing felt somewhat relieved. However, the Sidhe Empress had a mournful look on her face, “That battle had significantly weakened the vitality of the Sidhe Tribe and the Dragon Tribe. We had lost our most powerful powerhouses in that battle. Hence, it expedited the process of human beings taking over the world.”\n Zhou Weiqing replied, “If that is the case, the Lord of the Nether should be extremely weak since he was being sealed! Since he was unable to absorb any resentment from the external world, he should not be able to become any stronger. What happened?”\n The Sidhe Empress forced a smile and said, “It was indeed like that at the start - he was unable to strengthen himself, and we had also assumed that we could continue sealing him forever. However, as time went by, things began to change. We have no idea how the Lord of the Nether did it, but he managed to drill a small opening and carefully absorbed the resentment from the external world. When the Dragon Emperor finally noticed it, he had already gotten more powerful. Left with no choices, the Dragon Emperor could only strengthen the seal continuously. However, since the Lord of the Nether was able to break the seal once, naturally, he could do it a second time. If I guessed correctly, when he broke the seal for the second time, he was more careful compared to the first time he did it. He even managed to reach out to the Blood Red Hell and had gotten them to increase the amount of resentment in the external world, before channeling it into the Netherworld via the Blood Red Hell. Once he became sufficiently powerful he finally took action. By then, it was already too late when he had noticed it.”\n “After the Destructive Energy, that was formed from the negative emotions, had undergone the Lord of the Nether’s continuous purification, it became powerful to the point that it reached the Heavenly Change Stage. On the other hand, it is impossible for your Saint Energy to make a breakthrough to that level. Right now I simply hope that we are able to borrow your Saint Energy to thoroughly seal the Netherworld once and for all. In that way, you just have to strengthen your Saint Energy and channel it into the seal every now and then, such that he will be unable to get any stronger. Even though we are only solving the problem on a superficial level, and not dealing with the root of it, this is the only thing we can do as of now.”\n Zhou Weiqing nodded his head in silence. One could tell how powerful the Lord of the Nether was from how he was able to render such powerful beings, the dragons and the sidhe, completely helpless. However, there was no other way to deal with him. Even though they were unable to get rid of the problem entirely, at least their solution would allow this world to continue its existence.\n Hui Yao and Duo Si continued to fly deep down into the abyss; Hui Yao spewed balls of fire from time to time to light up the path ahead. It seemed as though the abyss was bottomless. They had flown for almost fifteen minutes, and based on their speed, they were at least fifty kilometers into the abyss. Nonetheless, there was no indication of them arriving at their destination.\n At this moment, suddenly, a soft ‘puff’ was heard and a bout of intense Destructive Energy was spurted out from down below.\n Zhou Weiqing’s senses were the keenest; he had reacted immediately upon sensing it. He did not budge. A stream of whitish golden Nebula Saint Energy shot out from a star that was embedded on the chest piece of his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set. Even though the Destructive Energy was not weak, it was not pure. The whitish golden light flashed and all the Destructive Energy had been consumed by the Saint Energy.\n “We have to speed up a little!” said the Sidhe Empress anxiously.\n Zhou Weiqing nodded. Dozens of Nebula Saint Energy rays shot out from his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set, forming an enormous whitish golden light shield that enveloped both dragons within it.\n Without needing Zhou Weiqing to tell them, Hui Yao and Duo Si increased their speed with all their might and dove down into the abyss.\n The two dragons’ cultivation bases were of the Heavenly God Stage. As they increased their speed with all their might, they were almost as quick as lightning. As they went deeper into the abyss, the aura of the Destructive Energy became more and more intense. Everyone had a grim look on their faces - they were praying hard for the seal to be able to hold out until they got there.\n Bang!\n A bout of Destructive Energy, that was several times more powerful than the one before collided against Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy light shield. It caused the two dragons to slow down for a moment. Fortunately, with the presence of powerful Saint Energy, as well as the fact that it became more purified ever since Zhou Weiqing reached the Max Level Heavenly God Stage, it managed to forcefully suppress the Destructive Energy in the air. Hence, after pausing for a brief moment, the two dragons were able to pick up speed and dove further down into the abyss.\n At this moment, a loud voice erupted, “Who’s that?” Immediately after, a bout of tyrannical energy ripples surged up from the bottom of the abyss. A gigantic figure came into view and blocked Zhou Weiqing and company.\n Zhou Weiqing was considered to be a man of wide knowledge and experience. However, when he saw the gigantic figure, he was completely shocked.\n Even though the abyss continued to extend downwards, its diameter got smaller and smaller. Even so, it was still approximately 500 meters wide. However, the massive creature that appeared below managed to block the entire 500 meter wide pathway - one could well imagine how huge its body was. Hui Yao and his wife looked extremely small compared to it. Bouts of Destructive aura was continuously being emitted from its body. The Destructive Energy that struck Zhou Weiqing and company turned out to be just a fallout.\n The massive creature was a turtle-shaped Heavenly Beast. However, the only thing that set it apart from a turtle was its head. Its head looked almost identical to Hui Yao’s. In fact, it was slightly bigger than Hui Yao’s. It was a dragon-headed turtle. At this moment, flower-like flames lit up on the patterns on its back. Its dragon eyes glared at Zhou Weiqing and company with hostility.\n “It is a dragon turtle,” said the Sidhe Empress, who was somewhat surprised. Her figure flashed and she got off Duo Si’s body. A gentle shade of green light, that was filled with Life Saint Energy, shone onto the dragon turtle’s body.\n The dragon turtle was in a daze for a moment, “The Sidhe Tribe? Life Saint Energy…are you the Sidhe Empress?” It looked at the six wings on the Sidhe Empress’ back and the hostility in its eyes quickly disappeared.\n The Sidhe Empress quickly replied, “I am the current Sidhe Empress. Respected Dragon Turtle Elder, what is the current situation with the seal? We had just killed the representative of the Lord of the Nether in the human world, and we realized that the seal is unstable, hence we have come to help. These human powerhouses are Zhou Weiqing and his wife, Tian’er. They had cultivated the Saint Energy with the help of the four Saint Attributes. I believe it will be helpful in strengthening the seal. These two dragons are the descendents of His Majesty, the Dragon Emperor.\n At this moment, the dragon turtle had a clear view of Zhou Weiqing and company. Zhou Weiqing had also retracted his Saint Energy.\n Without a doubt, the Sidhe Empress’ Life Saint Energy had won the trust of the dragon turtle. Since they were all from ancient tribes, the moment it saw the six wings on the back of the Sidhe Empress, as well as sensed the extremely soothing Life Saint Energy, it became certain of their goodwill.\n Hui Yao’s voice rang in Zhou Weiqing’s ears, “The dragon turtles are actually a part of the Dragon Tribe - they are considered a mutated species. They are extremely powerful. This Dragon Turtle Elder is most likely a High Level Heavenly God. Additionally, the dragon turtles are known as the Heavenly Beast with the highest defensive skills. Even in ancient times, their population was extremely small. Never did I expect the ancestors to have a dragon turtle attending upon them.”\n As he spoke, Hui Yao brought Duo Si along with him and went up to the dragon turtle, who had probably lived for centuries, and paid their respects.\n The dragon turtle’s huge head moved closer to Hui Yao; a ball of intense red light shot out of his eyes, landing on Hui Yao’s body. Hui Yao did not dodge - he stayed still, allowing the red light to shine on him.\n After a brief moment, golden radiance appeared in the eyes of both the dragon turtle and Hui Yao.\n The dragon turtle nodded its head at Hui Yao and said, “You must be the descendant of His Majesty that stayed in the Luster Spatial Realm. If that is the case, all of you have to follow me, quick! I’m afraid the seal is about to give way. Let’s talk and move at the same time. All of you, get on my back.”\n Hui Yao and Duo Si quietly landed on its back. Despite their huge bodies, the dragon turtle’s back did not seem crowded at all.\n A loud resounding sound was heard. Zhou Weiqing finally noticed that all four limbs of the Dragon turtle were inserted into the holes within the surrounding cave walls. Similarly, its four limbs were in the form of a dragon’s claw - they were extremely humongous. At this moment, it retracted its four limbs and all of them descended into the abyss.\n “All of you came just in time. There were multiple battles that happened in the area where the seal is. His Majesty is heavily injured. We cannot hold on any longer.”\n “What? Our ancestor is heavily injured?” Hui Yao was completely shocked.\n The dragon turtle replied in a deep voice, “For some reason, the Lord of the Nether has been continuously becoming more and more powerful over the past ten years. We were unable to locate where he had obtained his power from. Recently he launched several attacks on the seal, causing several cracks to appear on it. Furthermore, not long ago, he had forcefully broken a piece of the seal. His Majesty became heavily injured as a result, in order to stabilize the seal once again. However, all the cracks are becoming bigger and bigger. There is a possibility that he will break the seal any time. I’m sure you have felt the force from the Destructive Energy. It is the Lord of the Nether’s doing. Furthermore, judging from how the Destructive Energy is getting stronger and stronger, the seal will break any time now. If I had not noticed your presence, I would have already rushed over to help the rest of them strengthen the seal.\n Hearing the dragon turtle’s words, everyone could not help but gasp in horror. The situation was a lot worse than they thought. They could accept the fact that cracks had appeared on the seal. However, the Dragon Emperor, who played the leading role in sealing the Lord of the Nether, was heavily injured.
