Instead, the entire patch of ocean water instantly turned into a brilliant red, as if stained by fresh blood. \n Currently, Zhou Weiqing was in the ocean water, rather far from the actual battle ground. However, in that instant, he felt as though the entire waters around him was turning cold; the terrifying energy fluctuations so strong that it felt as if his entire body was being torn apart. \n What kind of energy was this? \n Vaguely, Zhou Weiqing could sense that the icy power was filled with both the Darkness and Demonic Attributes. Besides that, there was also a strange destructive power that seemed to bring a tearing sensation. \n A Fusion Skill. This had to be a Fusion Skill.\n Zhou Weiqing immediately made the judgement. Furthermore, this was a true Fusion Skill between the Darkness and Demonic Attributes. Zhou Weiqing had six-Attributes of his own, and more importantly, he was the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya’s disciple. In that short period of time, he had already accurately assessed this blow from Dreamwake and analysed it thoroughly. \n The blow that Dreamwake’s Dragon Spear had released was indeed the Tenebrous Attribute, but it was not as simple as that. Instead, it was a subtle sublimation and evolving, tantamount to a true Fusion Skill of the Darkness and Demonic Attribute. \n As for what this Skill was exactly, he was not clear. However, he understood that if the target had been himself, when that spear pierced down, and he did not have proper preparation, even the Saint Energy would not be able to save him. \n Dreamwake’s power was actually so strong to such a degree. Even that arrogant Terror Sea Dragon had been forced by the single blow to duck back into the ocean. \n “ROAR---” A ferocious dragon howl rang out, filled with utter rage. At the same time, a dark blue ray of light soared out from the ocean waters abruptly, splitting into countless water arrows shooting out at lightning speeds. \n Instantly, they shot towards the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake in midair. \n The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s wings spread out, and a massive purplish black whirlpool appeared below its body. The water arrows all slammed into the whirlpool, vanishing into nothingness at once. \n The Dragon Spear in Dreamwake’s hands pierced out once more. This time, a total of twelve streaks of blood-colored light shot forth one after the other, actually splitting up into different directions. \n Without even another second of thought, Zhou Weiqing flew out from the ocean waters once more, flying back as quickly as he could in retreat. Previously, it was just a single spear strike, and it had already affected him despite the distance. This time, it was twelve spear strikes, and he could just imagine how terrifying the power behind those strikes added up would be. He did not want to become the misfortunate hapless one again. \n The alarming amount of energy in the air rose constantly, and a resplendent light abruptly rose from the oceans to meet it. \n It was a bright blue shield of light, forcefully blocking all twelve piercing streaks of blood-coloured light. \n However, a strange sight occurred next. The seemingly solid blue shield of light was actually unable to fully block the piercing of the twelve streaks of blood-coloured light. Instead, twelve small holes were forcefully pierced in it, causing it to shatter. \n It was no wonder the Terror Sea Dragon had been so afraid of the previous streak of blood-coloured light. Even when it released a Heavenly God Tier defensive Skill, it was still unable to block them. Was this the true power of Dreamwake’s full eleven-piece Legendary Set, fusing her own strength with that of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon? Eleven pieces of Legendary Set God Tier Consolidated Equipment! Their strength truly lived up to their name indeed.\n Zhou Weiqing’s heart was slightly envious. After all, although his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set was also extremely powerful, it currently had the limit of being a ten-piece Legendary Set. Just thinking about the power boost he would gain from completing ten pieces of his own Legendary Set, Zhou Weiqing could vaguely guess the sheer terror that would be this eleven-piece Set, and what it granted to both Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon. \n The oceans water parted, almost as if split apart, and in a massive clashing sound, the Terror Sea Dragon rose from the ocean, soaring into the skies. Although it did not have wings, as a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, how could it not be able to fly? \n Horrifying energy reverberations exploded from its body instantly, its ferocious body pouncing directly at the Tenebrous Demon Dragon. At the same time, all of the spikes on the Terror Sea Dragon’s body turned a sapphire blue colour, and more than a thousand rays of blue light shot forth in all directions. \n The speed of the blue light was just too quick. Although Zhou Weiqing saw it extremely quickly, it was already too late to dodge it. That was because as soon as the blue light appeared, the water attribute in the atmosphere was actually frozen solid, causing his entire body to be freeze and harden in midair.\n This was not even the Terror Sea Dragon purposely targeting him, but the power of a Heavenly God Tier was just too great, and even a casual swipe could cause the entire world around to shake. \n Not good! Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in his heart. Left with no choice, he could no longer hide the Saint Energy, forced to use it to protect himself. \n Just as he was circulating his Saint Energy and preparing to protect himself, to break free of the Water Attribute Fetters.\n All of a sudden, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon turned slightly in midair, swooping down in a sloping fashion. At the same time, tens of thousands of the blood-coloured lights sprayed forth from Dreamwake’s Dragon Spear. \n Instantly, the world itself seemed to distort around them. However, to Zhou Weiqing’s surprise, all of the blue light that was in his direction were now blocked by a ray of blood light. \n She is doing this to save me! Zhou Weiqing’s heart shook, as a strange warmth rose in his heart. \n Even as they were facing such a powerful foe like the Terror Sea Dragon, Dreamwake was still looking out for him at such a distance. Putting their power levels aside, just this sentiment alone had seared itself deeply into Zhou Weiqing’s heart. \n Although this rascal Zhou Weiqing was definitely a perverted and wretched fellow, he placed much importance on feelings and emotions. When someone treated him well, he would pay back ten times in return. Dreamwake herself did not know that just this subconscious action of hers had caused Zhou Weiqing to have a sudden rise in approval and opinion of her. \n *PENG*\n For the very first time, the two massive bodies of the Terror Sea Dragon and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon slammed savagely into each other. \n In terms of absolute strength, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon was definitely no match for the Terror Sea Dragon. Its body was sent flying by the impact, and it was also struck by more than a hundred rays of the blue light, causing scales and blood to spray from the air. \n However, the Terror Sea Dragon did not get off easy as well. If it were just facing the Tenebrous Demon Dragon alone, then it would definitely be able to tear the Tenebrous Demon Dragon to shreds by paying a certain price. However, standing on the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s head, Dreamwake was actually posing a far greater threat than even the Tenebrous Demon Dragon itself. \n By this point, more than forty spikes on the Terror Sea Dragon had actually been vaporised from their attacks, and its injuries were no less than that of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon. Although with its powerful defense, it could still normally block Dreamwake’s attacks, when it seized the chance to injure the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, Dreamwake’s Dragon Spear had also reach the front of its face. \n Naturally, it did not want to use its own body to accept a blow from that terrifying Dragon Spear. After all, the Dragon Spear in Dreamwake’s hands was a fusion piece of the last two pieces of her Legendary Set. In any Legendary Set, the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls of the later pieces were definitely harder to create, and their power was correspondingly stronger. Furthermore, this was even a fusion of two pieces… that of an eleven-piece Legendary Set! Added on with the power of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, one could just imagine the sheer power behind this spear. \n The reason why the Terror Sea Dragon was so afraid of this Dragon Spear was because in the past, its father had perished to this very spear. The power of this spear… even a Mid Level Heavenly God Tier powerhouse like itself would not be able to accept so easily. \n The terrifying energy reverberations shook throughout the air around them. Zhou Weiqing did not know what the Terror Sea Dragon was thinking, but in that clash, it seemed like it did not gain any advantage. \n The massive body of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon spun in midair, a magnificent dragon roar emitting from its throat. Previously, the successful blow they had landed caused its confidence to grow. It had been a long time since it had fought in unison with a companion with the full Tenebrous Demon Dragon Legendary Set. In fact, it had almost forgotten the true power of that Dragon Spear. Even it had not imagined that Dreamwake could wield that Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear to such a degree. \n That scary Dragon Spear pierced forward once more, and the bloodshot eyes of Dreamwake did not seem to hold any emotions as her attention and spirit were fully locked onto the Terror Sea Dragon. \n The Terror Sea Dragon gave an enraged roar, its body beginning to glow brightly once more. This time, it was not just its body, even the ocean beneath it began to glow. A shocking amount of Water Attribute energies gathered instantly, forming a huge cage of atmospheric power, forcefully enclosing the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake in it. \n The Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear pierced out several times in succession, and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon also launched several powerful attacks simultaneously. However, as soon as the attacks touched the icy blue cage, they actually disappeared just as swiftly. Even if it was damaged slightly, the constantly gushing water attribute flowing from below would quickly replenish and repair the damage done. \n Having unleashed this powerful skill, the Terror Sea Dragon clearly showed signs of fatigue, but its eyes were extremely excited. \n “This is my Domain, so what if your combined powers can match mine? You will never be able to match the power of the entire oceans. Die, all of you… die! Hahahaha… once your Tenebrous Attribute energy is expended, that will be the time you will remain forever in my oceans.” \n Right at that moment, Dreamwake’s eyes suddenly lit up. She lifted the Dragon Spear high above her head, and a ball of blood-coloured light shone from the tip of the spear, forming the semblance of a petal. \n The blood-red petal did not destroy this Ocean Cage that the Terror Sea Dragon had summoned. Instead, in the next moment, twelve pillars of pitch black light suddenly soared into the skies from all directions. \n The Tenebrous Sealing Formation that had been prepared for such a long time had finally been activated. \n Both Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon had known that even with their joined forces, they would never be able to actually kill the Terror Sea Dragon in the middle of the ocean. To be able to fight it to a standstill and retreat fully intact would already be a feat in itself. However, they had come fully prepared for this! The Tenebrous Sealing Formation, this was a ‘gift’ they had prepared specially for this Terror Sea Dragon. It could be said that all of the previous fighting, all the changes and variances, while real, was all bait for the Terror Sea Dragon. The true reason was for it to enter the boundaries of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation. Once that happened, it would truly become the meat on their chopping board, easy pickings for them to slay. \n As expected, when the twelve pillars of black light rose into the sky, the Terror Sea Dragon started in surprise. Soon, that surprise turned into alarm, even panic, as its massive body shot forward in a flash. A thousand metres was a distance that could be covered in a mere blink to a powerhouse like it, but alas as soon as it reached the borders of the formation, it smashed savagely into one of the pillars of light and was sent bouncing back. \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-250-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
