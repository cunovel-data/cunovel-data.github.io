Originally an exquisite beauty, her laugh made the surroundings seem to pale in comparison. “Haha… Shangguan Yue, you old fellow. Hmph, aren’t you always so proud about your talent, you’re merely a four attribute Alexandrite Cat’s Eye!”\\n\\n As she said that, her gaze fell upon Zhou Weiqing once more: “You said earlier that you do not know what the sixth attribute is… have you Stored Skills for it?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “I have stored one. In the Skill Storing Palace, I chanced upon a small little cat with three eyes which kept staring at me. I had no idea what attribute it was, but I just tried Skill-Storing anyway, and I didn’t expect it to just succeed like that. However, that Skill doesn’t seem to be very useful, after all its range is 5 yards, and it’s might isn’t very strong.”\\n\\n “Three-eyed cat?” Tang Xian’s body shuddered a little as she gave a start. “Use on me one time.”\\n\\n “Okay” Zhou Weiqing agreed easily. The skill of his sixth Attribute did not seem to be an attack type skill, so he was not worried about trying it on Tang Xian.\\n\\n As the attribute wheel in his eyes spun towards to colourless wheel, he activated the stored skill, which surprisingly did not require much Heavenly Energy, only about the same as the Fetters of Wind.\\n\\n As he lifted his left hand, Tang Xian, Ling Zihan and Shangguan Bing’er saw the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye on his left wrist flash with a sudden light, which warped about and vanished as it landed on Tang Xian’s body.\\n\\n Tang Xian slowly raised her right hand, as her expression abruptly changed. “It truly is The Tyrannical Killer - The 3 Eyed Dragon Cat’s unique skill, Absolute Delay. Good Heavens! You little monster. Wait, that’s wrong! Even the Fei Li Empire’s Skill Storing Palace shouldn’t have such a rare Heavenly Beast like the 3 Eyed Dragon Cat. Zhou Weiqing, what colour was the 3 Eyed Dragon Cat that you Stored the Skill from?\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing thought a bit and replied: “I think it was yellow.”\\n\\n Tang Xian said in sudden understanding: “No wonder. The Fei Li Empire’s Skill Storing Palace really got lucky; they actually managed to catch a youngling of the 3 Eyed Dragon Cat. An adult 3 Eyed Dragon Cat is already beyond a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast, and would definitely be a nightmare for most Heavenly Jewel Masters, who would dare to catch it?”\\n\\n As she said that, she gave a strange look at Zhou Weiqing. “Even a youngling 3 Eyed Dragon Cat is already a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast; you’re only of the level of a single Jewel, and you could actually Store its Skill? Furthermore, you managed to get its unique skill Absolute Delay. This isn’t just something that can be explained by luck.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Perhaps that little 3 Eyed Dragon Cat found me pleasing to the eye and decided to gift it to me.”\\n\\n Ling Zihan saw her son’s smug appearance, and couldn’t help but scold him: “Smelly little brat, in front of your Aunt Tang Xian, what do you have to be smug about!”\\n\\n Who knew that Tang Xian said instead: “Let him be smug, he definitely has the right. Zihan Little Sis, you do not know, but that skill, Absolute Delay, is something that even that old Shangguan Yue will be envious of.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing rubbed his nose and said curiously: “Aunty, I didn’t find it very useful though! The range of effect is so low, and it seems like it only works for one second.”\\n\\n Tang Xian gave a humph and said: “What do you know! Absolute Delay is a monstrously strong skill, and can be even considered a heaven defying skill. Amongst the Di Huang Stage Heavenly Beasts, it is still considered one of the top skills. Furthermore, do not forget that you’re still only at the cultivation level of a single set of Heavenly Jewels, and your Stored Skills will improve and evolve as you get more Heavenly Jewels. When you reach 6 Sets of Jewels, you will find out how scary this Skill truly is.”\\n\\n “I’ll give you a piece of advice though; the true strength of the Absolute Delay lies in two places…”\\n\\n “The first is the that it’s an ability that can be easily manipulated around, and can be used with perfect compatibility with any Consolidated Equipment or Skill. You and Bing’er are both archers, so I’ll just give a simple example. If an enemy is using a weapon to block your arrow, but your arrow stops in the air for a second before continuing, what would happen?”\\n\\n Listening to Tang Xian’s explanation, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t help but show a startled expression.\\n\\n Tang Xian continued saying: “The second key point about it is the word ‘Absolute’. That is to say, it will definitely succeed and have the same effect no matter how strong your opponent is, no matter the cultivation level difference. Although one second might seem like a very short time, but in a fight between experts, a second of delay can be the difference between victory and defeat, the difference between life and death. You should train hard on this Skill, and it will be useful to you all your life.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Thank you Aunty.”\\n\\n Tang Xian did not seem to have heard him, continuing to mutter to herself: “Actually being able to Store the Absolute Delay Skill, looks like your mysterious sixth attribute is time, one of the three Saint Attributes that only the owner of an Alexandrite Cat’s Eye can have. Furthermore, there is the spatial attribute to complement it…”\\n\\n “Wind attribute for speed, Lightning attribute for damage, Spatial Attribute for constant change in the battlefield, Darkness for mystery, Evil for supplementing, and Time for Rhythm. This is almost the perfect mix.”\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’ had never known that her mother was actually so powerful, and had such profound knowledge about Heavenly Jewel Masters. As she heard her mother speak, she couldn’t help but ask: “Mum, what are the three Saint Attributes?”\\n\\n Tang Xian said solemnly: The three Saint Attributes refer to the Divine Attribute, Spirit Attribute, and Time Attribute. Actually, there should be four Saint Attributes, Evil was also once considered a Saint Attribute. However, because the Evil Attribute brings about too many negative side effects for the Heavenly Jewels, and furthermore it is not restricted to Alexandrite Cat’s Eyes, it’s total power is a little less than the three Saint Attributes that I mentioned earlier, thus it was removed from consideration. Bing’er, I have to say that your luck was actually pretty good.”\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er flushed deeply, giving Zhou Weiqing, who was grinning smugly at the side, a 180 degree pinch, before lowering her head in embarrassment.\\n\\n Tang Xian looked at Zhou Weiqing with a stern look: “Zhou Weiqing, I have to remind you. Although you are considered to be extremely gifted and talented, you have to know that no matter how talented a person is, without hard work and cultivation you will still not amount to anything. Furthermore, before you break through to the level of 6 sets of Heavenly Jewels, it is not difficult to kill you; any Heavenly Jewel Masters who have a higher cultivation level will still be able to handle you. At most, you can be considered outstanding amongst those of the same level.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said simply: “What about after six sets of Heavenly Jewels?”\\n\\n Tang Xian said passively: “After six sets of Heavenly Jewels, it should be enough for you to protect yourself. After nine sets, you will be hard pressed to find an opponent in the world.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, Thank you aunty for your teachings.”\\n\\n Tang Xian glared at him and said: “You’re already having this relationship with my daughter, are you still calling me aunty?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing blinked, and instantly understood the underlying meaning, and he quickly said with flattering tone: “Mum…” As he said that, he criticised in his heart: When you first came, you still said I did not deserve your daughter, in such a short time you already admitting I’m your son-in-law; such a quick change! Of course, how could he know, it was only people of Tang Xian’s power levels that could truly understand how terrifying and monstrous it meant to have those six attributes.\\n\\n Tang Xian nodded in satisfaction, while Shangguan Bing’er looked on dumbfoundedly. That rascal, his skin was just too thick, how could her mum also ...\\n\\n Tang Xian glanced at her daughter and said: “Nevermind, you should just call me Aunty for now. When you two are married, then you can change. Bing’er, you better keep watch on him, don’t let anyone snatch him away. When you two grow older in a few years time, you can get married. Zihan, us two sisters haven’t met in such a long time, aren’t you going to invite us in?”\\n\\n “Ah! Tang Xian Elder Sis, quick, come in!” Ling Zihan quickly responded. At this point, if we were to say who was the happiest in the whole scene, it had to be her. In her heart, Shangguan Yue and Tang Xian were like gods descended upon earth! Seeing her son being able to marry their daughter - in fact, Tang Xian seemed rather eager to do so, if not for the fact that her son was still young, it was likely they would host the wedding now - how could she not be happy and excited? Although it was the first time she had met Shangguan Bing’er, but from the earlier words she spoke, Ling Zihan already liked this future daughter-in-law; furthermore, she had heard the name of this most beautiful young lady in the Empire many times before.\\n\\n Seeing that both his mother and future mother-in-law had entered the house, Zhou Weiqing finally couldn’t resist any longer. Sticking his hands to his waist, he started laughing in glee “Wahaha! Wife, now you can’t run any longer! Even mother-in-law has agreed.”\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t help but wish that a hole in the earth would open up and swallow her, and she gave him a quick kick before running away.\\n\\n Tang Xian and Ling Zihan chatted till very late before leaving late at night, and before leaving they agreed to meet up more often.\\n\\n After his mother had seen Tang Xian off, Zhou Weiqing finally ran into her room with a stomachful of doubts. “Mum, how did you know my future mother-in-law? From your reaction, it seems as if she is even more powerful than dad?”\\n\\n Ling Zihan was in a very good mood now, and she couldn’t help but laugh as she said: “Little brat, your luck is really good!”\\n\\n “That year, I was only a teenager, and I met a Heavenly Beast at the river side, and almost died there and then. Luckily, I was rescued by Shangguan Yue and Tang Xian who had been travelling the parts. At that time, your father was still studying and training in the academy, and was not at home; we were still not married at that time. To repay them, I invited them back to my house to stay, and they really loved it there at your (maternal) grandfather’s house, and so they stayed for a while. I do not know their origins, but they are definitely extremely powerful. I do not know what Tang Xian Elder Sis’ cultivation level is for sure, but twenty years ago, when Shangguan Elder Brother killed that Heavenly Beast, the Elemental Jewel around his wrist was similar to yours, but he had ten of them!”\\n\\n “Ten sets?!” Zhou Weiqing’s eyes widened and he couldn’t help but exclaim in shock. A Heavenly Jewel Master with an Alexandrite Cat’s Eye, with ten sets of Jewels! What kind of power and strength was that? Even his father was only had eight sets of Heavenly Jewels, and furthermore was only of a single attribute, yet he was already considered the strongest in the entire Heavenly Bow Empire. Twenty years ago, he had already had ten sets of Heavenly Jewels, that was already beyond the Zong stage. By now, who knows what his power levels had grown to. Zhou Weiqing had never expected that Shangguan Bing’er’s father would be so powerful!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-5-chapter-27-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
