(1)\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing wiped the tears off his face, smiling joyously as he said: “I can’t wait to dote on her, how could I possibly bear to bully her? Please rest assured.”\\n\\n Phelia smiled faintly and said: “Rest assured? It isn’t that easy eh, young man, it is not a good habit to spread your love too much.”\\n\\n Seeing Phelia’s eyes, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but feel a chill down his spine. He could only smile and nod, not daring to say anything.\\n\\n Tian’er turned her head, her gaze moving past Zhou Weiqing to land on Gu Yingbing. She pulled back and turned to Gu Yingbing, bowing as she said apologetically: “Big Bro Gu, I am really sorry. I know that you feel for me, and you have always treated me well. However, my heart already has Little Fatty. I am sorry.”\\n\\n By this time, Gu Yingbing had stood up straight again, his gaze fixed on Zhou Weiqing. He bit his lip and said savagely: “Zhou Weiqing, remember this, it is not done between us. You are currently not strong enough, but you must protect Tian’er well. I will not admit defeat just like this, even if Tian’er marries you, I will not give up so easily.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Bro Gu, if not for the fact that we are love rivals, I think that we can become friends. Thank you for loving and taking care of Tian’er all these years, you are a worthy opponent who can be respected. Even so, I will not give you any chance to steal Tian’er away from me. She is mine, this life, the next life, and forever.”\\n\\n In that instant, Zhou Weiqing seemed to be giving forth an indescribable glowing power and presence. There were three Heavenly Emperor stage powerhouses and two Heavenly God Tier powerhouses present, but at that moment, it was as if Zhou Weiqing was the center of attention.\\n\\n Originally, the lights of the four Saint Attribute which had been whirling above Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s heads suddenly fused together, forming a faint white light pillar which enclosed Zhou Weiqing, causing his entire body to give forth a light of treasure. Right in the middle of his forehead, a white stripe appeared.\\n\\n This was no longer an ordinary tattoo[1. It\u0027s not exactly clear here but I think TJSS is comparing it to the previous black tiger tattoos that usually come up when he enters Demonic Change State/Dragon Tiger Transformation], perhaps using the phrase ‘line of god’ would be more apt. The white line seemed to form the ‘King’ word, yet like a dragon encircling it, with the outer circle of white light. Such a strange sensation, everyone around could feel it. At the same time, all the environmental energy of the entire icy cavern started rushing towards Zhou Weiqing’s body crazily.\\n\\n “This… this is…” Not even Xue AoTian understood what Zhou Weiqing was going through. Only the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia’s eyes widened in shock.\\n\\n “Heaven and Earth Primary Tide! How is this possible… how could it be?!” Phelia exclaimed\\n\\n Xue AoTian looked at his wife in surprise. “Heaven and Earth Primary Tide? What is that?” Without hesitation, Phelia replied: “Only for one that ascends above the Heavenly Dao will have the ability to summon and endure the Heaven and Earth Primary Tide. So, it seems that the legends of old were actually true… The gathering of the Four Saint Attributes can truly cause a miracle that transforms the heavens! After going through this baptism of fire of the Heaven and Earth Primary Tide, his spiritual senses will transcend to Divine Senses, and he will be nearly immune to all forms of spiritual suppression. Furthermore, due to the fact his Divine Spirit will be far above his own Heavenly Energy, his future cultivation will be even faster. Even his body will slowly evolve to be above the Heavenly Dao Stage.”\\n\\n In truth, there were other reasons added together coinciding in this change that Zhou Weiqing was experiencing, and it wasn’t just as simple as Phelia mentioned. Otherwise, since Tian’er was also bathed in the whirlpool of the Four Saint Attributes, how did it not have the same effect on her.\\n\\n Ever since Zhou Weiqing had bathed in the lava of the Fire Spirit Mountain, he had entered a unique state of cultivation. The fusion of the Solidified Dragon Spirit and his Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline was already an existence that surpassed the Heavenly Dao. The reason was simple, both Dragons and the Dark Demon God Tigers could be considered existences that were at the maximum of the Heavenly God Tier, pushing beyond even. No matter how one looked at it, these two should never be possible to fuse together. Yet, somehow Zhou Weiqing had done it, and it had been because of the Four Saint Attributes fusion he had gone through that allowed it.\\n\\n When that fusion completed, it had already brought Zhou Weiqing’s new bloodline to a whole new level, a state that defied the heavens.\\n\\n That was not to say that Zhou Weiqing would suddenly become invincible or reach the Heavenly God Tier instantly. It was that his body and talent now had the strong potential to surpass the Heavenly God Tier in the future.\\n\\n Towards this point, even Long Shiya had not been able to make a judgement, let alone Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n After all that, Zhou Weiqing had then started training in the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation, even going so far as to create his own Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. That had allowed his connection to the world’s energies to grow even stronger, to bring him closer to nature; his body and Heavenly Energy both evolving in a qualitative change. Originally, at that time, Zhou Weiqing already had the potential to bring about the Heaven and Earth Primary Tide. However, at that time, Zhou Weiqing’s mind and heart had not been in harmony and understanding, filled with thoughts and worry about Tian’er. Furthermore, without the burst of energy from the fusion of the Four Saint Attributes, there was no push in aiding him breaking past the shackles of the heavens, and he could only remain status quo.\\n\\n However, just in that previous instant, he had already succeeded in gaining back Tian’er. As he held her hands, the fusion of the four Saint Attributes had burst forth in power. With his mind and heart finally in harmony, along with all the previous conditions fulfilled, it had actually abruptly brought about the Heaven and Earth Primary Tide.\\n\\n From this moment on, the Heavenly God Tier’s door was already officially wide open to Zhou Weiqing. That was to say, in his future cultivation, no matter the Heavenly King Stage, Heavenly Emperor Stage or Heavenly God Stage, there should be no large bottlenecks for him. Especially with the aid of the Four Saint Attributes, if he stayed together cultivating with Tian’er, there was the real possibility of him surpassing even the Heavenly God Tier stage… the Heavenly Jewel Change!\\n\\n Even Xue AoTian couldn’t help but reveal a strong envy on his face as he looked upon the white light surrounding Zhou Weiqing… let alone the others.\\n\\n However, no one dared interrupt Zhou Weiqing. Only Long Shiya stood relatively closer to him, watching anxiously. After all, while Zhou Weiqing was still undergoing the baptism of the Heaven and Earth Primary Tide, all the powerhouses in the area, even those hidden Heavenly Beasts of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, were benefiting a lot from the fallout effects.\\n\\n More than five minutes passed before the Heaven and Earth Primary Tide finally subsided. Zhou Weiqing’s originally bronzed skin now shone with an inner glow. Even stranger were his eyes, now black and shiny as a precious gem, his gaze deep and profound yet without any fire. If one were to look closely, it gave an impression of unbelievable clarity and pureness.\\n\\n The Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia looked at her son-in-law to be, a glow in her eyes. Only when the Heaven and Earth Primary Tide had receded did she take a step forward to say: “Weiqing, do not forget the agreement between you and me.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing nodded immediately: “Mother-in-law, do not worry, I remember it clearly.”\\n\\n Phelia smiled faintly before turning her gaze to Tian’er. Her eyes turned gentle and loving, tears brimming as she said softly: “Tian’er, my child, can Mummy hug you, please?”\\n\\n “Mummy?” Even though Tian’er had been with Phelia earlier, her memories had been Sealed and her consciousness suppressed. As such, she had not learned about Phelia. Now that she had regained her memories, she had vaguely guessed the importance of Phelia, but hearing her actually say the words, Tian’er couldn’t help but tremble uncontrollably.\\n\\n From a young age, ever since she could remember anything, she only had her father, and not her mother. Seeing all those Heavenly Beasts having their mothers, she was so envious. Now that she finally met her own mother, she somehow did not know what to do or what to say.\\n\\n Besides excitement, her inner heart was also dazed and confused. Perhaps, if not for Zhou Weiqing’s and the joy it had brought her, Tian’er might not even be able to accept Phelia. After all, for twenty whole years, Phelia had never even appeared once. If one were to say that Xue AoTian was not a great father, then Phelia was not even a passable mother.\\n\\n However, currently Tian’er was in a state of joy and fortune from reuniting with Zhou Weiqing, and even the slight hatred she had felt for her mother was washed away.\\n\\n Slowly, in a trembling voice, Tian’er said: “Mother… why… why do you not want Tian’er!”\\n\\n Hearing those words, Phelia could no longer control herself. Taking an abrupt step forward, she enveloped Tian’er in her embrace, sobbing uncontrollably.\\n\\n Xue AoTian quickly hugged both mother and daughter, and the family of three was immersed in a mix of sadness and joy, locked in embrace.\\n\\n Gu Yingbing looked deeply at Zhou Weiqing, but he did not say anything further. Turning around, he supported his father, and with the aid of the Tiger King Xue Aoying, they silently left.\\n\\n It could be said that this time, the arrival of Long Shiya and Zhou Weiqing had caused the entire WanShou Empire to be thrown into disarray, their entire ruling structure in a mess. Gu Yingbing would no longer be able to inherit the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord position, and the Lion King Gu Site had also been stripped of his title of King, at least within the next month. For a short period of time at least, the entire WanShou Empire would be thrown into turbulence. However, no matter what the future lay for them, it would no longer have any connection with Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Long Shiya stood beside his precious disciple, a faint smile on his face. This ending was perhaps the best possible ending for him, and he placed a fat palm on Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder, silently giving him a big thumbs up.\\n\\n Without question, without Long Shiya, Zhou Weiqing would not even have the chance to ascend the Heavenly Snow Mountain, with neither the ability or right to do so. However, after that, everything else today had been the result of his own efforts and hard work. From setting up the entire scene, to provoking Xue AoTian and sparking that fatherly love in his heart, to the three rounds where he had spent his all in defeating Gu Yingbing… It could be said that Zhou Weiqing had far surpassed all of Long Shiya’s expectations and hopes. That was without even talking about him going through the Heaven and Earth Primary Tide and his limitless possibilities in the future.\\n\\n …\\n\\n The entire Heavenly Snow Mountain was soon thrown into a massive shock. The Lion Prince Gu Yingbing and the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord daughter’s wedding had been called off without warning, causing all the Tribe Leaders who had come as guests to be totally surprised. However, due to the authority and power of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, no one dared to say anything. Under the command of the Tiger King Xue Aoying, the Tribe Leaders slowly left silently. Of course, no one dared attempt to retrieve back the gifts they had brought...\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya were arranged to stay in the Heavenly Snow Mountain for a time. It was such a rare chance that Phelia was able to return, and she wanted to spend every second with her husband and daughter, and even Zhou Weiqing had to be placed behind in the ‘queue’. Besides a few short chances to see Tian’er every day, he spent most of his time in his own room cultivating.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-22-chapter-182-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
