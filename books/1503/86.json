I named the two fusion skills too. ‘Overlord Binding Arrow [1. Decided to chose a ‘tamer’ name in the end]’ and ‘Overlord Lightning Explosive Arrow’.” Shangguan Bing’er said curiously: “What are your other skills then?” Zhou Weiqing said: “I was unable to find an Evil Alignment Heavenly Beast to Store Skills, but it seems like my Elemental Jewel somehow came originally with the Evil Alignment Skill Stored within already. As for Wind Attribute, I have Stored the ‘Fetters of Wind’ Skill, and for the Spatial Attribute, it is the ‘Blink’ Skill.” “Fetters of Wind?! Blink?!” Shangguan Bing’er cried out in surprise. The two skill names were like extremely famous and she had definitely heard of them before. After all, they were high quality skills that could only be obtained from Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts! One was a Control Type Skill, while the other was an extremely formidable life saving skill. These high quality skills were extremely hard to store, and in general only Zong Level Jewel Masters would be able to even try. Adding on to that those Skills she hadn’t even heard of, like the ‘Touch of Darkness’, ‘Lightning Explosive Palm’, down to the unknown Evil Attribute Skill. Perhaps because Zhou Weiqing was only at the first set of Jewels, his strength was not obvious yet. However, the more he cultivated, the more those skills would grow and evolve together with him. In the future, when he reached the Zong Level and got his 6th set of Heavenly Jewels... As she thought up to this point, there was only one phrase left in Shangguan Bing’er’s mind to describe him: Absolutely Terrifying. “Little Fatty, you shouldn’t have told me. To us Heavenly Jewel Masters, our Elemental Jewel Skills are our greatest secrets. Furthermore, your skills are all so strong. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.” Shangguan Bing’er said apologetically. Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “Keeping a secret is against outsiders. Why would I need to keep secrets from you?” Just as he finished his sentence, he suddenly grabbed Shangguan Bing’er, and pounced onto her, dropping them both to the ground. Because of the sheer sudden motion, both of them rolled for a distance. In that instance when he pounced onto her, a Silent Arrow flew past right where they had been and disappeared into the darkness. “It’s that fellow again. Zhou Weiqing immediately identified the attacker. No matter archery skills or cultivation level, this person was higher than them. That Silent Arrow was really just so hateful. By the time he had jumped off from the watchtowers earlier, he only had about 20% of his Heavenly Energy remaining. Even with the energy whirlpools at his four Death Acupuncture Points spinning at top speed, he had only recovered a little, and was still far from being able to use his Overlord Bow. As Shangguan Bing’er rolled on the ground, she had already released her Consolidated Equipment the Silent Tracking Arrow. As soon as she stabilized, she drew the Purple Dawn Bow and let loose, sending the Silent Tracking Arrow forth into the distance. To the two of them, what posed the greatest threat was the Silent Arrow of Bai Jiu. Although some of the other Kalise Jewel Masters might actually be stronger than Bai Jiu, in terms of speed they could not compare to him. Not only was his firing rate extremely quick, the Silent Arrow was even deadlier in the dark of the night. With his harassment, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er were unable to flee at their maximum speed. Shangguan Bing’er’s Silent Tracking Arrow flew in a straight beeline towards Bai Jiu. However, Bai Jiu just reacted calmly, the fourth Jewel on his wrist shining forth with a sudden brilliance, a pale green round shield which seemed rather light appeared in front of him. With a loud clanging sound, it blocked the SIlent Tracking Arrow. The ten or so Jewel Masters who had followed Bai Jiu in pursuing them were mostly 3 to 4 Jewelled, but there were two 5-Jewelled Jewel Masters. Alas, the two 5-Jewelled Jewelled Masters were not agility or speed based, although they were strong, but they were still not in range yet. Only 5 Speed/Agility based Jewel Masters were still able to keep up with Bai Jiu at this point. Shangguan Bing’er did not hesitate at all; after firing her arrow, she started running once again together with Zhou Weiqing, constantly making use of the trees and the brush around as cover. Bai Jiu kept close pursuit. Ignoring everything else, just the fact that he had been scared into pissing his pants was stoking the flames of his rage. That was just too humiliating. Even though he had wet his bed til 10 years old, but hadn’t he not done so for 10 years? If he didn’t take revenge, how could he call himself a man? Furthermore, he had instantly recognized Shanggang Bing’er, and knew this was a great opportunity for them to kill her. Unfortunately, his teacher had not arrived yet, otherwise... Just comparing speeds alone, Shangguan Bing’er was a dual agility Heavenly Jewel Master, while Zhou Weiqing had his mysterious Demonic Right Leg. Both of their speeds could be considered extremely impressive. However, the problem was that their cultivation level was just too low, with a single set and two sets of Heavenly Jewels respectively, with Shangguan Bing’er’s Heavenly Energy only at the 8th level Heavenly Jing Stage. On the other hand, for those who were chasing them, even if their speed boosts were lower, but they had the advantage of having a higher cultivation level, as they had at least broken through the Heavenly Shen Energy stage. With such additional boosts, their speed was no lower than Zhou Weiqing or Shangguan Bing’er. As the chase continued, arrows were exchanged constantly. Although Shangguan Bing’er and Zhou Weiqing managed to occasionally retaliate with some arrows, the 3-4 Jewelled Jewel Masters basically all had life-saving skills. Despite succeeding in injuring some, but it was mostly minor injuries, and Bai Jiu continued leading the chase on, and were in fact slowly gaining ground. The only relatively good news for the pair was that Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy had mostly recovered. When he ran, most of his speed burst came from the Demonic Right Leg, thus allowing him to save a lot of Heavenly Energy. Coupled with the insane regeneration rate of the Immortal Deity Technique, he had already regained another 70% of his Heavenly Energy in just the hour they had been fleeing. Right at this moment, right ahead of them at a relatively close distance, a low roar suddenly sounded out. A pair of ghostly green eyes appeared in their vision. Shangguan Bing’er cried out in startlement: “It’s a Forest Direwolf! They are one of the most dangerous and troublesome amongst all the Shi Stage Heavenly Beasts. Although their individual strength are not very strong, but they run in packs. Meeting them now, this is going to be a problem.” “Climb a tree!” Zhou Weiqing made a snap decision. Wolves generally did not have the ability to climb trees, and when facing them, climbing up a tree was generally the best choice. Of course, these Forest Direwolves were Heavenly Beasts, and you couldn’t always judge them by the abilities of normal wolves. “Wuuuuuu ——’ A loud wolf’s howl sounded out, and whizzing sounds appeared all around. In that moment of chaos, no one could tell how many Forest Direwolves appeared all of a sudden, charging forth and gathering to this point. These Forest Direwolves did not all charge forth brainlessly. It seemed as if they had prepared for this and knew how to coordinate; some were charging in from the front, while others flanking from the side. They did not just surround Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er, but also the 6 enemies who were chasing them from behind. “F***!” Bai Jiu couldn’t help but curse in repressed anger and despair. “Hurry up! We have to finish them off before the direwolves completely surround us! Remember, do not attack those damn direwolves! If any of them are injured, they will never give up hunting us to the death.” Although chasing and kill Shangguan Bing’er was important, but how could it compare to his own life! Bai Jiu immediately turned and ran.
