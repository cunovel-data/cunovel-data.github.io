(1)","content":"However… just as Zhou Weiqing said, he was too late.\\n\\n Not even a Heavenly God was able to prevent Zhou Weiqing’s actions at a time like this. When the black light landed atop the silver light, it actually bounced off. The Tenebrous Attribute was actually unable to breach that incredibly dense Spatial Attribute.\\n\\n Moments later, that powerful silver light began to twist and distort, transforming impossibly fast into an absolutely enormous vortex. Even the Tenebrous Demon Dragon blanched at this vortex. It frantically beat its wings to stay aloft, while Dong Fang and the other Heavenly Emperors didn’t dare to relax either. They could all tell that this was a Spatial Chaos Rift!\\n\\n This was no mere technique. It was a true Spatial Chaos Rift. Anyone trapped in the center of it would instantly be ground apart and killed. Even Heavenly Gods wouldn’t be willing to touch that thing. Although Heavenly Gods had tough bodies, who knew where a Spatial Chaos Rift might lead?\\n\\n Right now, there was no one capable of holding Zhou Weiqing back. The silvery-white light emanating from Zhou Weiqing only grew stronger. As the creator of this Rift, he wouldn’t be affected by it because it was all being generated by his Spatial Teleportation Gem.\\n\\n Terrifying ripples of energy burst out wildly, causing the absolutely awesome Spatial Chaos Rift to widen even further. The dense Heavenly Energy ripples caused the entire Xuantian Citadel to shudder. Moments later, an enormous figure suddenly flew out from the very center of the Spatial Chaos Rift.\\n\\n It was a dragon. A giant dragon. This dragon was over a hundred meters long, and its wings were the size of giant stormclouds. This was an enormous dragon whose entire body was a fiery red.\\n\\n Xuantian Palace’s powerhouses were all stunned. None of them ever would’ve imagined that Zhou Weiqing would be able to use the Spatial Teleportation Gem to summon an enormous dragon. And… judging from the size of the thing, it was far beyond the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s capabilities! Zhou Weiqing actually had a card like this? He was even able to summon a great dragon? No wonder he had come for the Spatial Teleportation Gem. He actually had an incredible secret technique to use it with! None of them knew that the Spatial Teleportation Gem could actually be used like this.\\n\\n Judging from its size, this newly arrived great dragon was enough to be a match for all of the other Xuantian Palace powerhouses combined. Regardless of who won or lost, this would be an apocalyptic blow for Xuantian Palace. It was impossible to defeat such a powerful creature without paying a catastrophic price.\\n\\n This was what Dong Fang was thinking, but the person who was the most shocked wasn’t her. It was the Tenebrous Demon Dragon. This was because the Tenebrous Demon Dragon could clearly sense that the great dragon before it had the most pure and exalted Dragon Emperor Bloodline. In other words… this was one of the true progeny and descendants of the Dragon Emperor!\\n\\n It had once stated that even the progeny of the Dragon Emperor wouldn’t necessarily be able to defeat the Terror Sea Dragon in the oceans, but that was just hypothetical. Amongst the dragons, without question the descendants of the Dragon Emperor were the most powerful of all. And… this great dragon was clearly an adult one!\\n\\n The Tenebrous Demon Dragon knew very well that the majesty of the Dragon Emperor Bloodline’s aura meant that there was no way it could last long in a fight against this great dragon. This would’ve been true even back when it was at the height of its power… and now, it had just recently suffered severe injuries. Good heavens! What sort of harbinger of doom had Xuantian Palace offended? He had actually summoned a great dragon like this!\\n\\n If the arrival of the great dragon had caused Xuantian Palace’s forces to feel incomparable awe and horror… then what happened next drove them to absolute despair.\\n\\n The enormous silver vortex that was the Spatial Chaos Rift didn’t close after the great dragon emerged. After it appeared, it flew straight behind Zhou Weiqing, and the very first thing it did was to lock its gaze unhesitatingly upon the Tenebrous Demon Dragon. A powerful draconic aura instantly swept forth.\\n\\n In the next instant, yet another enormous figure began to slowly emerge from the Spatial Chaos Rift. When it appeared, the ambient temperature of all the mountains around Xuantian Palace actually began to skyrocket. The Tenebrous atmospheric energies were actually the first to vanish, and the Tenebrous Sealing Formation evaporated like smoke.\\n\\n Yes. This was another great dragon, and this one was actually twice as large as the first one! When this terrifyingly large dragon emerged, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon nearly fell down from the skies when it sensed the second dragon’s aura. The terrifying draconic aura alone was nearly enough to wipe out all four of the Heavenly Emperors.\\n\\n T-this is…\\n\\n The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s eyes bulged out, and it couldn’t prevent its wings from shuddering. It recognized the second dragon. It genuinely recognized it. Is this the Dragon Emperor…?\\n\\n Dong Fang and the four Grand Elders were completely stupefied. They were Heavenly Emperors, which meant they were supreme powerhouses amongst humans. Even Heavenly Jewel Masters wouldn’t dare to breathe loudly in their presence. But… when they saw those two enormous Heavenly God-level dragons which seemed to be even more terrifying than the Terror Sea Dragons (while not being weakened on land) they finally felt complete despair.\\n\\n Bathed in blood. So he wasn’t just speaking out of anger when he said he would bathe us in blood. He’s actually able to do just that. If it had been just one great dragon, then the concentrated forces of Xuantian Palace might be able to just barely match it… but facing them was two adult great dragons!\\n\\n Worse, the largest great dragon was emanating an aura that was probably close to that of a peak Heavenly God’s. Something like this would be able to kill the Tenebrous Demon Dragon with ease, much less them.\\n\\n When the second great dragon appeared, it fluttered its wings and actually sent its great bulk flying into the skies. It then flew over to stand behind Zhou Weiqing, lifting him up onto its draconic head and then raising its head proudly. A dense beam of red light shot out, covering Zhou Weiqing within it. Its majestic draconic eyes were filled with a look of excitement.\\n\\n Why had Zhou Weiqing come to Xuantian Palace to acquire the Spatial Teleportation Gem? It was because he needed to use it to bring forth these two great dragons, so that they wouldn’t have to destroy the Luster Spatial Realm and wreck the entire Heavenly Jewel Island. If he simply needed to bring them out… he could do that whenever he wanted, right?\\n\\n However, prior to this Zhou Weiqing wasn’t absolutely certain about doing this. This was going to be his final, ultimate trump card. When the second Terror Sea Dragon had appeared, he had considered doing it, but he wasn’t sure if it would work. The Xuantian Continent was tens of thousands of kilometers away. Would he even be able to summon those two great dragons here? The Spatial Teleportation Gem didn’t have many uses left. Unless absolutely necessary, he wouldn’t casually risk it.\\n\\n But the situation was now completely different. Bing’er was dead, and Zhou Weiqing had been driven mad with grief. Given the situation, how could he remain rational?\\n\\n He wanted to gain revenge for Bing’er, but he himself wasn’t even close to being strong enough to do this. How could he be a match for Xuantian Palace? And so, he was left with no other options. He immediately made the seemingly-insane decision to summon the dragons… and his success had proven him right.\\n\\n When Zhou Weiqing had first left the Luster Spatial Realm, the great dragon Hui Yao had placed its location marker within Zhou Weiqing’s mind and also told him the method needed to summon itself and Duo Si.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing had been worrying a bit too much. From a certain standpoint, it could be said the two great dragons didn’t quite exist within the Boundless Mainland. They existed in a separate realm entirely, and so ‘distance’ didn’t really come into play when moving from one realm to another. As a result, Zhou Weiqing succeeded. He actually managed to summon both of these great dragons.\\n\\n Hui Yao’s eyes flashed with lightning. It had already recovered fully, and its majestic gaze became locked onto the Tenebrous Demon Dragon as well. “Thank you, Weiqing. You helped us escape. It seems you have met with some trouble. Speak. What do you need us to do?”\\n\\n Hui Yao’s voice was very low, but when it spoke it caused the mountains to tremble. Everything around it slowly began to turn red.\\n\\n This was completely different from how the Tenebrous Demon Dragon or the Terror Sea Dragon used atmospheric energies. When they used atmospheric energies, they clearly had to rely on their own energies to do it. This great dragon Hui Yao, however, had given off a completely different feeling. It was as though the atmospheric energies had voluntarily submitted to it, naturally allowing it to command them.\\n\\n When the Tenebrous Demon Dragon heard Hui Yao’s words, it felt despair. Dragons were extremely proud, and they would never allow humans to command them without a good reason. The reason he remained here and protected Xuantian Palace was because Xuantian Palace consisted of the descendants of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Bloodline. However, these two great dragons who had the Dragon Emperor Bloodline actually seemed to be submissive towards Zhou Weiqing. This was simply unbelievable.\\n\\n None of them had any idea that Zhou Weiqing had actually saved the lives of these two great dragons! If it wasn’t for him and his women, Duo Si probably would’ve died long ago, and none of her children would’ve survived. If it wasn’t for them, Hui Yao wouldn’t have been revived either. Thus, although these great dragons were incredibly proud figures, they treated Zhou Weiqing as an absolute equal. He was a friend, a comrade, an ally.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-256-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
