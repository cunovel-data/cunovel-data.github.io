{"id":52003,"no":829,"title":"Chapter 281 - Spiritually Connected, Lives Shared (2)","content":"Throughout the history of the sidhe, in general, the ancient tree of life would usually undergo evolution once. There were only two ancient trees of life that had undergone evolution twice, and in those two occurences, the sidhe became the ruler of the entire Mainland. One could imagine just how great the benefits of the evolution of the ancient tree of life were for the sidhe. As for the ancient tree of life before their eyes, it was in the midst of going through its second evolution. Perhaps, due to the fact that the human beings were too strong, even if the ancient tree of life had completed its evolution, the sidhe would still be unable to prevail over them to reclaim their sovereignty over the Mainland. However at the very least, with an ancient tree of life that had undergone evolution twice, they no longer had to hide within the sealed grounds. They were able to walk out with dignity and no longer had to fear for the survival of their tribe. To the sidhe, this was something of historical significance! Even the old fellas who had lived for more than a thousand years would cheer jubilantly because of it. “From the looks of it, there is no need for us to worry about our safety,” muttered Shangguan Xue’er, who was with the Seraph. She was the most knowledgeable person when it came to the sidhe’s legacy. Witnessing the second evolution of the ancient Sidhe tree, she was more shocked than surprised. Without a doubt, after going through the second evolution, the sidhe would definitely walk out of the sealed grounds, without the need to hide. The light vanished and the five women appeared on the ground. After Shangguan Xue’er nodded her head at the other four women, she walked over to the elders and said to the First Elder, “I’m sure this proves that we have no ill intent. The second evolution of the ancient Sidhe tree signified Her Majesty’s evolution. In other words, Her Majesty’s current condition is much better than her condition before she left here, meaning that she isn’t in danger. Right?” At this moment, the First Elder’s emotions had more or less stabilized. After hearing her words, he nodded profusely, “Yes, yes. Since the ancient tree of life had undergone evolution, that shows that Her Majesty is not in any danger. I apologize for our reckless behavior earlier. In any case, why don’t all of you stay here for now. Perhaps when Her Majesty returns, all of you will become her esteemed guests.” Even though he was not entirely sure, the First Elder had guessed that the evolution of the ancient Sidhe tree must have had something to do with Zhou Weiqing. Otherwise, why would the ancient tree of life only evolve when Zhou Weiqing was out with the Sidhe Queen for a day, whereas it had shown no signs of evolution ever since she became a Heavenly God a few hundred years ago? However, no matter what and no matter how it evolved, it was an immeasurable blessing to the sidhe! Naturally, there was no need for them to worry about anything else. Even if the Sidhe Queen had really died, as long as the second evolution could be completed, the ancient tree of life would automatically appoint a new Sidhe Queen. The ancient tree of life was still in the midst of evolving - the process of evolution was not something that could be completed overnight. As for how long the process would take, even the elders of the sidhe were unclear of it. All they could do was wait in excitement and joy. On the other side, Zhou Weiqing was still silently guarding by the Sidhe Queen’s side. Day after day, time passed. Even though Zhou Weiqing was able to continue emitting his Saint Energy with the help of the Nebula Celestial Territory, it was in fact getting harder and harder for him. Fortunately, after he had channeled in a certain amount of Saint Energy, the Sidhe Queen’s body started to show some changes. She started to release bouts of strange energy ripples, and also absorbed the life aura in the external world, without being affected by Zhou Weiqing’s Nebula Celestial Territory. In that way, her demand for Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy had lowered by a great deal, allowing Zhou Weiqing to continue supporting her. At the start, Zhou Weiqing was purely helping the Sidhe Queen with no other intentions, but thereafter, he took the opportunity to cultivate. Ever since he broke through to the Heavenly King Stage, the increase in Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base was akin to a rocket shooting up to the sky. Within a short span of a few months, he had advanced to the Heavenly Emperor Stage. Even though such an increase would not affect his body negatively in any way, and that he even got to evolve his body once more, Zhou Weiqing still had a long, long way to go in terms of perfectly amalgamating all the powerful abilities, and proficiently using their full power. Hence, he seized this opportunity to comprehend and adapt. The continuous release and absorption of the Saint Energy, as well as the help provided by his Nebula Celestial Territory, allowed Zhou Weiqing to clearly sense the changes in the Saint Energy. While this was beneficial in helping him increase his cultivation base, it was even more helpful in giving him a greater understanding of nature. Under such circumstances, an amazing loop was created between Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen. After he entered the state of cultivation, he did not realize that the Saint Energy emitted from the Astral Saint Core Nucleus on his chest was now connected to the the Life Core on the Sidhe Queen’s chest. As time went by, they become more and more intimately connected, the jadeite-like energy light between them had solidified without them realizing. The Life Energy that was emitted from the Sidhe Queen had been continuously cleansing Zhou Weiqing’s body, removing every last bit of impurity in it. Zhou Weiqing’s body was becoming purer and purer, like the Sidhe Queen’s body. Hence, the sacrifice he made was also being repaid. Faint light flickered. A smile of relief slowly appeared on Zhou Weiqing’s face. He had no idea how much time had passed, but he could clearly sense that the Sidhe Queen’s heart was beating stronger than before. He could even sense that the Sidhe Queen was gradually regaining her consciousness. As for why he was able to clearly sense that, Zhou Weiqing had no clue. He only discovered that their heartbeats were in sync. Just as Zhou Weiqing slowly opened his eyes, his Saint Energy had stopped emitting from his body on its own. At the same time, the Sidhe Queen’s eyes slowly opened as well. She had a perplexed look in her eyes. The both of them had awakened at the same time, looking into each other’s eyes. Looking at Zhou Weiqing while sensing the immense change in her body, the Sidhe Queen was stunned. And at this time, Zhou Weiqing could actually sense the strong fluctuations in her emotions. Although she felt shy and was also at a loss, she was more overjoyed and excited in comparison. He could even sense the evolution of her Life Core from her consciousness. What is going on? How do I know what she’s thinking about? Zhou Weiqing stared dumbfoundedly at the Sidhe Queen. At this time, her gaze became sharper. She was equally shocked. At this time, she had a strange look in her eyes, because similarly, she could also sense what Zhou Weiqing was thinking. Be it Zhou Weiqing or the Sidhe Queen, at this very moment, they were both thinking the same thing: This is impossible. However, the truth was right before their eyes. Zhou Weiqing pulled himself back together shortly after. In order to prove that it was impossible, he subconsciously thought to himself: I want to kiss her. Immediately, the Sidhe Queen’s face blushed. She looked up at him and did not seem to reject the idea of it. Instead, she slowly got up and walked over to him. On the other hand, he could sense the bashfulness within her, as well as her cordiality towards him, coupled with desire. She actually did not reject me. Why? In the next moment, the Sidhe Queen was already standing before him. She lifted her head and extended her milky white arms, wrapping them around Zhou Weiqing’s neck. Her cold, delicate and moist lips that were filled with life aura gently kissed Zhou Weiqing’s lips. Bam —— The exact same feeling of shock overwhelmed the both of them. In that instant, they were both trembling in their hearts. Immediately after, they felt as though they had become a single entity, seemingly allowing them to control the other party. Their kiss lasted a long time. Looking from the outside, it could be clearly seen that they were both enveloped in a rich golden light, and the Astral Saint Core Nucleus and the Life Core on their chest had each emitted a solidified light ray, connecting the two of them, as though they were both physically joined together. After an unknown amount of time had passed, Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen opened their eyes, feeling perplexed. Slowly, their lips pulled apart; they looked at each other in shock, joy and mostly disbelief. “How did this happen?” They asked at the same time. “You go first,” said the both of them in unison again. “I don’t know,” said the both of them at the same time once again. They had become even more perplexed due to the fact that they said three exact same sentences at the same time. Just like that, they hugged each other without uttering a single word. Regardless of whether it was Zhou Weiqing or the Sidhe Queen, both of them could not imagine such a thing happening. They continued looking into each others’ eyes. Zhou Weiqing could swear on his life that although he was usually lewd and promiscuous, he had never harbored any dirty thoughts towards the Sidhe Queen, who was in his arms! Ever since he did the deed with Dongfang Hanyue in the Xuantian Continent, he had resolved to cultivate his heart and nurture his character - he would not let his wives down again. Most importantly, he was worried that he might lose them due to his philandering ways. The current situation they were in was completely beyond the scope of his understanding. After a long pause, the Sidhe Queen reacted first. Zhou Weiqing harbored no dirty thoughts towards her, and even more so, she did not harbor any lewd thoughts towards him. She had absolutely no idea about relations between a man and a woman - her heart was extremely pure without a single impurity. Looking at Zhou Weiqing who was standing so close to her, shyness was all she felt. Amidst her shy thoughts, she muttered, “This… could this be spiritual connectivity and the sharing of lives?” Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but ask, “What is spiritual connectivity and the sharing of lives?” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-282-2","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis] In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
