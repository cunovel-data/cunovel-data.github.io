{"id":51349,"no":175,"title":"Chapter 52 Ye Paopao and A Test (1)","content":"Chapter 52 Ye Paopao and A Test (1)\n Towards the Heavenly Demon Sect, after the talk with Ming Wu and Ming Hua, Zhou Weiqing had some basic understanding of it. However, what was that so-called Top Peak of the North, or Heavenly Snow Mountain?\n Without question, since he had been returned to his room safely, it must have been that white clad young lady who had saved him. How could she possibly defeat the nine Jeweled Ming Wu with her own six Jeweled cultivation level? Also… Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel… her Elemental Jewel was actually also the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel!\n Zhou Weiqing’s mind wandered back to the beauty of the white clad young lady last night, and he subconsciously swallowed a gulp of saliva. He muttered to himself: “That white clad young lady, it seemed she was beautiful and perky. Alas, I hadn’t been able to have a good look before she knocked me unconscious. What a shame… Hmm… I wonder why that lady from the Heavenly Snow Mountain would want to save me.”\n He did not notice that Fat Cat who had been sprawled on the chair listening to him suddenly twitched a little.\n After thinking about it for a while, Zhou Weiqing shrugged, a smile on his face. He had the certainty regarding a few key points, and the rest wasn’t any issue as he could slowly figure them out in the future.\n It was simple, since that Tian Er from the Heavenly Snow Mountain had sent him back home and not taken him away, it revealed one thing. She had either beaten or scared off Ming Wu and Ming Hua, and had somehow guaranteed that they would not take revenge. Otherwise, what would be the point of saving him at night and leaving him alone to fall once more?\n Having thought it through, Zhou Weiqing decided not to continue dwelling on it. As for why the young lady from the Heavenly Snow Mountain wanted to help him, he didn’t try to think any further. Since she did not speak to him, he was happy to keep clear of them. After all, even though her beauty was exceptional, he was afraid that she might have a similar motive as the Heavenly Demon Sect, then he would be out of the frying pan and into the fire. Now that he could just act like he didn’t know anything, Zhou Weiqing naturally did so.\n Flipping onto his feet, he changed into clean clothing after washing up. By the time he entered the living room of their house, a steaming hot breakfast was ready for him.\n It was a simple breakfast, a few eggs, a big bowl of porridge, some mantou, some pickled vegetables and several fruits.\n Shangguan Bing\u0027er had finished with her chores and saw him heading in. “Quick, eat up and we can head to the academy together.”\n Zhou Weiqing quickly flashed towards her, appearing beside her. In mid air, he grabbed hold of her and as she let out a startled cry, he gave her a quick kiss on her mouth.\n “Little Fatty! Hmph!” Having succeeded in stealing a kiss, Zhou Weiqing quickly darted aside, not allowing her to take revenge. Seeing her huffy look, and the breakfast on the table, Zhou Weiqing felt a warmth and satisfaction in his heart.\n “Little Fatty, if you continue being so bad, I won’t make breakfast for you tomorrow!” Shangguan Bing\u0027er said exasperatedly.\n Zhou Weiqing grinned, grabbing a mantou and said: “My precious Bing\u0027er, could you bear to do that? It’s just a kiss, it is very normal for husband and wife!”\n Shangguan Bing\u0027er glared at him and ignored him, sitting down and starting to eat herself.\n As they ate, Zhou Weiqing suddenly said: “Bing\u0027er, let me tell you a story okay? As an apology.”\n Shangguan Bing\u0027er looked at him dubiously as she continued eating, not knowing what he wad up to.\n Zhou Weiqing toyed with the mantou in his hand, saying: “Heh heh. There was once this guessing game, and a man was in charge of hosting it, while two others would play the game. The host would take up something for one of the players to see, and the player would have to somehow use actions or words to describe the object, but would not be able to use the name of the object or things related to the name. The second player would have to guess what the object was, and if he guessed correctly, they would win.”\n Shangguan Bing\u0027er was drawn to the story, listening hard as she ate.\n Zhou Weiqing rolled the round mantou in his hands, smiling broadly as he said: “This time, the two players were a husband and wife couple. The host took out a mantou and showed it to the wife, and it was up to her to describe it. The wife used her hands to gesticulate in a round motion, and said to her husband: ‘It’s round, it’s white, and you ate it last night.’ Bing\u0027er, can you guess whether or not the husband guessed correctly?”\n Shangguan Bing\u0027er said: “He should have guessed correctly. The wife already described it so clearly, and the only thing that could have matched the description should be a mantou.”\n Zhou Weiqing then said with a straight face: “Nope, the husband guessed wrongly. After hearing his wife’s words, he guessed - Breasts.”\n Shangguan Bing\u0027er started a little, then her mouthful of porridge sprayed out as she turned beet red. Looking at Zhou Weiqing sitting there playing lasciviously with the mantou in his hands while staring at her chest, she realised that this rascal was teasing her.\n “A beautiful lady spitting out porridge, that’s not good! What happens if you choke, slow down, slow down.” Zhou Weiqing said as he smiled beatifically, starting on his on food.\n After that, up until the time when the two of them reached the entrance of the Fei Li Military Academy, Shangguan Bing\u0027er still pursed her lips and ignored Zhou Weiqing, although he was thick-skinned enough to just grab onto her hand and hold on.\n “Wife, today classes are finally starting! You’ll have to study hard!” Zhou Weiqing held onto her hand and walked through the entrance grandly. Shangguan Bing\u0027er tried to struggle free but couldn’t do so.\n “I have to study hard? What about you?” Shangguan Bing\u0027er said exasperatedly.\n Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “I’m different, I just need to be the man behind the scenes, controlling the talented generals.” Although he seemed relaxed on the surface, he was in truth in a large amount of stress. After all, Ming Hua was his class teacher, and he could not guess what she would do to him.\n As they spoke, they entered the academy grounds. However, as soon as they entered the main building, they were halted\n It was a group of over a dozen students who stopped them. They were all noble students, and with their grand uniforms, they all had a superior air about them.\n The one leading them was a youth of about twenty years old, and looking at him, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes flashed with a hint of surprise.\n The features of the youth was rather ordinary, definitely the sort that one might overlook in a crowd. However, all the noble students treated him very respectfully. His gaze was rather gentle and seemingly flawless, his face in the pink of health, looking to be a cheerful person of sunshine. If it had been any other situation, he would seem to be a pleasant person who wasn’t any threat at all.\n Ye Lou who had slunk away from the scene yesterday at the opening ceremony was standing beside this youth, his posture bowed and fawning.\n “You are Junior Zhou Weiqing?” The youth leader looked towards Zhou Weiqing with a faint smile. His voice was as peaceful and calm as his gaze.\n Zhou Weiqing inclined his head and said: “Yes, I am Zhou Weiqing. You are? What business do you have with me?” After last night, Zhou Weiqing decided to tone down his aggression. After all, this was the Capital City of the Fei Li Empire, and there were many powers at play that he would not be able to deal with. He had already made his mark, and it would be best to play safe for now. After all, he was not alone here, and Shangguan Bing’er was together with him.\n “Junior Zhou, good morning. My name is Ye Paopao, and I’m a third year student. I’m here today specially to look for you, to apologise to you on behalf of my little brother and his actions yesterday.” As he said that, he gave a slight bow towards Zhou Weiqing in apology.\n Ye Paopao? The name was alien to Zhou Weiqing, but without question, he had to be the boss that Ye Lou spoke of yesterday. Zhou Weiqing surmised that this Ye Paopao had to be one of the leaders amongst the entire noble student population.\n “Senior, there is no need to do so. What’s in the past is in the past.” Zhou Weiqing smiled and replied. Currently, there was no hint of the aggressive arrogance he displayed yesterday in the opening ceremony.\n Ye Paopao smiled and said: “My name might be a little strange to you. [1. 泡泡 (Pao Pao) means bubbles, hence the comment] I am here today to not just apologise, but also to get to know Junior. After all, your actions yesterday at the opening ceremony was indeed surprising and impressive. I have so heard that you are a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, and wanted to say that if in the future Junior has any Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for sale, I am willing to pay twenty percent above the market price for them. Price is not a problem.”\n This Ye Paopao was no simple person! Zhou Weiqing said calmly, unruffled. “That is great, I just happen to have a few Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for sale here. If Senior is interested, you can buy them.”\n Since there was money to be earned, why not? Furthermore, it was clear that he was here to make peace, and Zhou Weiqing needed to stay in the academy for the next few years, and there was no need to make things difficult for himself by falling out with Ye Paopao without any reason. The most important thing was that Ye Paopao was extremely different from Ye Lou, literally heaven and earth. Although he might be not necessarily be a good person, he was at least not a disagreeable or hateful person.\n With that thought in mind, Zhou Weiqing reached into his Spatial Necklace and took out the Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls he had created yesterday.\n Seeing Zhou Weiqing take out boxes of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls one after the other, Ye Paopao could not help but be taken aback. From Zhou Weiqing’s actions yesterday, he had not expected him to be so agreeable, as it seemed that both sides were on opposing sides. Indeed as Zhou Weiqing expected, he had come here today to make peace, but had not thought that Zhou Weiqing would trust him so easily.\n Ye Paopao received the five wooden boxes from Zhou Weiqing’s hands, and opened one of them. With a single look, he immediately showed a surprised and pleased look on his face.\n “A Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scroll!”\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-52-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
