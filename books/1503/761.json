After being bathed by that astral light, our bodies seemed to have benefited from it. Not just that. Although that night sky only appeared for a brief period, I can sense that in reality a total of forty-nine days have gone past.” They were Heavenly Gods whose senses regarding the natural world were far more acute than the senses of ordinary humans, especially with regards to time. They often went into long periods of slumber, after all. If they couldn’t sense the passing of time, they wouldn’t even know how old they were! When Duo Si heard Hui Yao say this, Duo Si immediately unleashed its own senses. A moment later, Duo Si’s jaw dropped own in surprise. Hui Yao was right. Forty-nine days had gone past during that brief moment of astral light accelerating and disappearing. What was going on? They had no idea, but when they looked at Zhou Weiqing they no longer saw that simple, ordinary human youth. Zhou Weiqing continued to float there, all the light having been completely withdrawn into his body. The only difference was that on his chest, a ball of light seemed to emanate ephemeral flickers. There weren’t any particularly powerful energy ripples. Zhou Weiqing looked like a very ordinary person, but the wings on his back had already vanished. He himself, however, continued to hover in the air. His skin had turned as pale as ivory, and it glowed with sleek, glossy light. His features were never particularly handsome, but right now they felt almost holy and sacred. He seemed to have become translucent. As he hung there in the sky, he was like part of the air itself rather than a human. If you closed your eyes, you wouldn’t be able to notice he was there. Not even the two Heavenly God dragons could sense his presence. Hui Yao let out a long breath, draconic eyes spread wide. If in the past he could easily sense how Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation was changing, even for a powerhouse like him Zhou Weiqing had now turned into an enigma. There was no point in using any type of senses to try and scan him. Zhou Weiqing, still floating in the air, slowly opened his eyes. When they saw his eyes, the two great dragons and Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t help but stare. Zhou Weiqing’s eyes weren’t glowing with dazzling light as they had imagined. In fact, it was just the opposite. His eyes looked a bit glossier than the eyes of others, but there was nothing particularly powerful to them. Heavenly Jewel Masters were different from ordinary people. The more powerful a Heavenly Jewel Master was, the more powerful their auras and their gazes would become. And yet… Zhou Weiqing seemed to have completely lost these Heavenly Jewel Master abilities. It was as though he was just an ordinary person… but could that really be true? How could an ordinary person float in the skies? As he opened his eyes, the dazzling ball of light in his chest grew dim. It was as though everything had gone back to normal. Zhou Weiqing bowed down in midair, offering his respects to Hui Yao and Duo Si. “Thank you, seniors, for assisting me. Weiqing shall never forget your help.” His voice didn’t seem to have changed, but it now had a certain charisma that felt extremely comfortable. Hui Yao smiled and shook his head. “No, this was your destiny. You did good deeds and so reaped a good reward. In addition, we benefited from your ascendance as well. I really want to know what cultivation level you have reached.” Zhou Weiqing chuckled. “To be honest, I’m not sure either. I think I’m a Heavenly King, but I don’t know what stage.” The two great dragons were both rather shocked to hear him say he was a Heavenly King. As they saw it, no Heavenly King could’ve caused those phenomena which Zhou Weiqing had just displayed. Clearly, his Attributes had mutated somehow. However, Shangguan Bing’er had a different interpretation when she heard this. A twenty-three year old Heavenly King! This was a speed of cultivation which was unequalled in past, present, and future in the Boundless Mainland… and the man who did it was her man. A deep sense of pride pervaded Shangguan Bing’er’s heart. The feeling was quite marvelous. She spread her wings, discarding her embarrassment and throwing herself into Zhou Weiqing’s arms. Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing’er in his arms. He was every bit as excited as Shangguan Bing’er, but he didn’t reveal it. It seemed as though his mentality had transformed and grown just as much as his cultivation had. Shangguan Bing’er nestled herself into Zhou Weiqing’s arms. She felt that he smelled extremely good right now. She couldn’t explain what he smelled like, but she felt that it was refreshing and comfortable. Zhou Weiqing said to Hui Yao and Duo Si, “Seniors, I wasted quite some time. Let’s continue on our journey.” Hui Yao nodded. He exchanged a glance with his wife, then the two transformed into balls of fire that flew into the Spatial Teleportation Gem around Zhou Weiqing’s neck. Once they actually entered the Spatial Teleportation Gem, they discovered to their astonishment that the gem, which had teetering at the brink of collapse, had actually been fully repaired. Now only was it now extremely sturdy, its Spatial power had increased countless times over. Zhou Weiqing hadn’t repaired it. Clearly, when Zhou Weiqing had made his breakthrough, the Spatial Teleportation Gem had been repaired by the energies he had emitted. One could simply imagine how marvelous Zhou Weiqing’s Attributes were! Zhou Weiqing himself had the deepest understanding as to what had happened. To put it simply, only Heavenly King-level Saint Energy was ‘real’ Saint Energy. The Sea Emperor Shuttle once more descended from the skies into the sea, with Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er hopping into it. They closed the lid, then Zhou Weiqing hugged Shangguan Bing’er and said with a smile, “Bing’er, I think we’ll arrive home a bit earlier.” Shangguan Bing’er said, “Little Fatty, do you know how much time you used up after Devouring that thing and then breaking through?” Zhou Weiqing shook his head, puzzled. Shangguan Bing’er said, “Nearly two months.” “WHAT?! That long?” Zhou Weiqing had thought that it had been half a month at most. He didn’t imagine that two months would have gone by in the blink of an eye. “Then let’s hurry up and go back. The two seniors are waiting for us to return so they can rescue their children.” When he thought of coming back, Zhou Weiqing felt as though he needed to go home immediately. He had temporarily discarded everything else to come here, but in truth he needed to do many, many things. His most important task was to rescue his parents and the others, then re-establish the Heavenly Bow Empire! Zhou Weiqing didn’t use his hand to press the crystal into the indent. Instead, he just willed it and the Sea Emperor Shuttle instantly shot forward like a bolt of lightning, diving into the sea and disappearing. This sudden acceleration badly startled Shangguan Bing’er, even though her body didn’t suffer from it. Zhou Weiqing’s body glowed with a layer of faint golden light which captured her as well, sending the Sea Emperor Shuttle hurtling through the seas like an arrow.
