{"id":52074,"no":900,"title":"Chapter 307 - Saint Infant (1)","content":"The Lord of the Nether’s green eyes stared coldly at Zhou Weiqing; his attack did not come to a halt. To put in more accurately, it had only just begun.\\n\\n His body flashed, but he did not disappear. However, his speed was extremely fast, such that it had not much difference with the Blink Skill. What was more frightening was the fact that Zhou Weiqing was unable to engage in the Blink Skill in the Netherworld. This was because he was unable to find the Spatial Law in this place. He was still able to destroy the Spatial Law, like before. However, it was entirely impossible for him to grasp and use it.\\n\\n Sharp claws stealthily appeared on the Lord of the Nether’s right hand. At the same time, the eight legs on his back started spreading out. A green net of light charged directly towards Zhou Weiqing. This shade of green was the original color of the original Destructive Energy - it was far more terrifying compared to the black Destructive Energy.\\n\\n The Lord of the Nether’s attack was very simple - there weren’t any sequences of movements or any fancy steps. It was simple and direct, relying solely on the tyrannical energy and speed.\\n\\n A clear ray of white light descended from the sky and landed on Zhou Weiqing’s body. Immediately, a layer of whitish gold light curtain enveloped his entire body. It was Tian’er’s doing.\\n\\n At this moment, changes appeared in Tian’er’s body. With her own body as the main body, the three pairs of wings on her back flickered with whitish golden light. Her body had transformed into a seraph. However, her body still maintained its original size, keeping her Saint Energy at its highest concentrated state to the best of its abilities.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing advanced forward, instead of retreating. He took one leap into the air, with his body facing the front. Suddenly, all the starlight on his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set lit up. Terrifying Saint Energy condensed on each and every single starlight. It seemed as though it was going to explode at any moment, thoroughly destroying the entire space.\\n\\n Even the Lord of the Nether was shocked after sensing Zhou Weiqing combusting his Saint Energy with all his might. He was about to charge right in front of Zhou Weiqing but he abruptly made a turn and flew away instead.\\n\\n An odd grin appeared on Zhou Weiqing’s face, “Dumbass, I was bluffing you.” The Saint God Core Nucleus quietly appeared out of Zhou Weiqing’s body. What Zhou Weiqing did earlier was executed with the help of the Saint God Core Nucleus. As for whether or not he meant to deceive the Lord of the Nether, only he himself knew best.\\n\\n A stream of Milky Way came down from the sky, as though the Milky Way spilled all over the Dual Legendary Hammers, destroying the green light released by the Lord of the Nether. The Saint Energy and the Destructive Energy created a violent collision sound that sounded like a series of screeching sounds that made one’s teeth hurt.\\n\\n Without a doubt, due to the issue pertaining to the purity of Zhou Weiqing’s energy, the consumption of his energy was a lot more significant compared to the Lord of the Nether’s. However, he was also causing the Lord of the Nether to exhaust his precious original Destructive Energy. Now the Lord of the Nether was unable to attain any nourishment from the outside world, hence Zhou Weiqing’s game plan was to exhaust his energy, bit by bit. After falling for Zhou Weiqing’s trap and exhausting his original Destructive Energy in vain without achieving anything, the Lord of the Nether let out an angry cry. His speed increased exponentially as he shot towards Zhou Weiqing like an arrow of green light. From the looks of it, it seemed as though he wanted to perish together with Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was extremely calm. He clearly knew for a fact that there was a possibility this would be the last battle of his life. He wanted to engage his powers and execute them perfectly. Even if he were to die, he would definitely make sure that the Lord of the Nether would suffer too.\\n\\n At this moment, the gigantic Dual Legendary Hammers were like rice straws in Zhou Weiqing’s hands. He did not move, but the Dual Legendary Hammers swung twice in front of his body. They had the same flickering whitish golden Saint Energy, however, the aura that they had was different.\\n\\n The Lord of the Nether was this close to crashing into them in the next moment. There weren’t any explosion sounds; the Lord of the Nether could only feel the energy in front of him emitting strange ripples. His body skidded to the side and did not crash into Zhou Weiqing. At this moment, despite the fact that his original Destructive Energy was that pure, all it could do was extinguish the two bouts of energy released by Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Spatial Rend coupled with the Time Disorder Skill; that was what Zhou Weiqing used in his earlier retaliation. It should not be forgotten that even though he possessed the Saint Energy, he was still a Heavenly Jewel Master that possessed six Heavenly Jewels of different attributes. Within the Netherworld, if he wanted to exhaust the Lord of the Nether’s original Destructive Energy as much as possible, he absolutely could not depend solely on his Saint Energy to counter it. The difference in their powers were too huge after all. Right now, all Zhou Weiqing could rely on were skills and techniques.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s body brushed past the Lord of the Nether’s body; the Lord of the Nether’s speed could only be described as lightning-fast. However, Zhou Weiqing had displayed his incomparable gift of combat. From his bluff at the start to his defense after, it could be seen that Zhou Weiqing had completely predicted everything. Hence, he was able to neutralize the Lord of the Nether’s attacks. At the same time, when he casted the merged technique, of the two skills, his body had already turned halfway. When the Lord of the Nether had skidded next to him, it was as though Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Legendary Hammers were akin to a meteor hammer, forcefully striking the Lord of the Nether on his back.\\n\\n A rumbling sound was heard. Not taking the Saint Energy on top of the Dual Legendary Hammers into account, just the terrifying brute force alone was sufficient to cause the Lord of the Nether distress.\\n\\n Amidst the loud sound, his entire body shot out, like a cannonball. In a blink of an eye, it transformed into a green dot of light that disappeared from Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s field of vision. One could well imagine how terrifying the power of Zhou Weiqing’s hammer attack was.\\n\\n However, Zhou Weiqing did not stop because of this. He had also felt the recoil from the original Destructive Energy after attacking the Lord of the Nether with his hammer, and the Saint Energy within his entire body had vanished.\\n\\n He kept the Dual Legendary Hammers; both his hands gestured and two triangle-shaped light coincided in front of him. The Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation abruptly appeared. Furthermore, it was a dual Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation.\\n\\n Two dazzling hexagram-shaped whitish golden light appeared above Zhou Weiqing’s head and beneath his feet respectively. Twelve Heavenly Jewels orbited within them, flickering.\\n\\n By relying on the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, Zhou Weiqing was able to conserve and reduce the consumption of his Saint Energy while displaying his full powers and might. His earlier collisions with the Lord of the Nether should not be overlooked - although on the surface, it might seem as though Zhou Weiqing had the upper hand, however, upon contact, Zhou Weiqing had a much deeper understanding pertaining to how terrifying the original Destructive Energy was. His Saint Energy was directly depleted by twenty percent after being in contact with the original Destructive Energy, before it could neutralize its effects. It was extremely frightening!\\n\\n Under concealment of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, the whitish golden light started to undergo strange changes - Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy began to transform into white incandescent light.\\n\\n Even Zhou Weiqing did not expect the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation to have such a special effect. He was the person who casted the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation - it only took him a split second to understand the reason behind it.\\n\\n It was not because his Saint Energy had undergone another round of purification process; instead, after the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation caused the Heavenly Jewels of his six different attributes to merge perfectly, it created a boosting effect. Naturally, this boost had an effect on the Saint Energy, causing it to be more powerful.\\n\\n The Dual Legendary Hammers appeared in Zhou Weiqing’s hands once again. He pointed the huge hammers to the front, and the rich white incandescent light made it looked like a small sun that emitted an incomparable dazzling luster.\\n\\n At this moment, the Lord of the Nether’s green figure appeared within the range of this white incandescent light. His speed was extremely fast - earlier on, even though the attack from the hammers were rather powerful, it was not sufficient to inflict any real harm on him. Nonetheless, he was disheartened by it. His figure flashed, flying right back to where he was, and happened to see the completion of Zhou Weiqing’s Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation that caused the Saint Energy to be purified once more.\\n\\n Buzz——\\n\\n This time, the Lord of the Nether did not directly charge towards Zhou Weiqing. The eight long legs on his back lit up at the same time - every one of them turned into a shade of emerald green that was surrounded by a dense black aura. Eight rays of green light shot out from the tip of the eight legs before condensing into a ball of light in front of him. At the same time, he placed his hands together and another ball of green light appeared thereafter.\\n\\n In an instant, the entire Netherworld brightened up. It was filled with green luster.\\n\\n A massive pressure came in all directions, suppressing Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s bodies in a frenzy. Both their Saint Energy were mobilized at full speed, in order to prevent the massive Destructive Energy from harming them.\\n\\n Space, time and everything else seemed to have been sealed off. This time, it was not as simple as being unable to grasp Spatial and Time Laws - he was even unable to use any other techniques as well. He could only rely on the purest energy to counter the attacks.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s skills had caused the Lord of the Nether to have a hard time as he was not prepared to sacrifice his precious original Destructive Energy once more. The more frugal he was, the bigger the price he had to pay. He had already decided to end the battle at this very moment.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing had the gravest look on his face; he managed to bring Tian’er back to him with the help of Saint Energy. The white incandescent light of the Saint Energy on his body became exceptionally strong.\\n\\n The Dual Legendary Hammers overlapped each other in front of his chest; every single starlight on the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set lit up. They were in the Netherworld. The Lord of the Nether was the true leader here. The moment he decided to fight Zhou Weiqing in a head-on combat, Zhou Weiqing was left with no other choice. At this moment, all he could do was to ignite all the Saint Energy within his body and fight the Lord of the Nether to the death, with every last bit of Saint Energy that he had.\\n\\n The Lord of the Nether’s eyes lit up. He had already made plans - he was going to use Zhou Weiqing’s death to elicit negative emotions from that wife of his. Right now, he could only hope that the energy from the negative emotions would be sufficient for him to create a small crack in the formation, even if it was the smallest one. If that were the case, he would have a chance to escape the Netherworld.\\n\\n Buzz—— The two green light balls in front of him abruptly overlapped, becoming one. However, it did not increase in size. Nonetheless, upon merging, an extremely dark black light appeared in the center of the green light ball. It looked as though it was an eye, staring coldly at Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n The Eye of Destruction - the Lord of the Nether’s most powerful method of energy conservation. Initially, when he was at his peak, he relied on this technique to create cracks within the formation of the seal. At this moment, he was going to use this technique against Zhou Weiqing. Even though he was no longer as powerful as how he used to be at his peak, the power of the Eye of Destruction was still terrifying.\\n\\n In almost an instant, the pitch-black light shot out at a lightning-fast speed. On the other side, Zhou Weiqing was affected by the aura as well. All of the starlight that erupted from his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set had merged as one with the white incandescent light from his Saint Energy, transforming into a fine but extremely condensed solid white incandescent light before colliding with the brazen light that shot out of the Eye of Destruction in the air.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-307-1","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
