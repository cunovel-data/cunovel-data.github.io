{"id":51991,"no":817,"title":"Chapter 278: The Sword of the Demon God (1)","content":"The dense Saint Energy ripples circled in the air and an overbearing suppressive aura erupted. Zhou Weiqing’s mind went almost instantly blank.\\n\\n In Mother Nature’ eyes, the entire world turned gray.\\n\\n The pressure of death appeared within the Sidhe Queen’s heart at once. Almost instantly, a high-pitched whistle came from Mother Nature’ lips. An intense green light wrapped around her body transforming her into an enormous green crystal. At the same time, not far from the crystal, twelve crevices appeared in the void. Twelve figures of elderly men had appeared out of nowhere behind the crystal. Thereafter, twelve green rays of light were channeled into the crystal at the same time.\\n\\n ‘Ding’ ——\\n\\n A sharp sound was heard. It caused the entirety of the sealed grounds to tremble violently, as well as the surrounding space to collapse.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing wasn’t even able to see the Sword of the Demon God clearly before it seemingly vanished into thin air. At most, he could only sense the trace of gray shadow coming into brief contact with Mother Nature’ enormous green crystal before disappearing.\\n\\n Seconds after, the Demon God that Zhou Weiqing summoned followed suit and disappeared, revealing the six of them.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s face was pale - even though the series of blows exchanged were rather brief, they affected him greatly. It was his first time since becoming a Heavenly Emperor that he had exhausted such a massive amount of energy, he nearly could not withstand it.\\n\\n The crystal in the sky and the twelve figures behind it were frozen.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s face fell - he could infer that the Sidhe Queen was a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse. Additionally, the twelve figures that appeared behind her were all Heavenly Emperors; four of them were Max Level Heavenly Emperors.\\n\\n The sidhe enter adulthood at the age of 100, but those elders looked like they already had one foot in the grave - they must have lived for thousands of years! The strength of the sidhe was a lot more frightening and formidable than what Shangguan Xue’er described before. At this moment, the combined energy consumption of Zhou Weiqing and the five women was rather significant. If the Sidhe Queen could maintain the condition of Mother Nature and continue launching attacks, he might have to escape with the help of the nebula in the sky - he could not possibly stay there and await his impending death.\\n\\n While thoughts raced through Zhou Weiqing’s mind, the enormous crystal in the sky started experiencing slight changes.\\n\\n The twelve figures made a ‘puff’ sound and their bodies flew out at almost the same time. Each of them had a gray stream of air spewing out of their mouths - that was right, it was not blood, but a gray stream of air. It was as strange as it got.\\n\\n Moments after, a piercing shattering sound was heard. Cracks continuously formed on the green rhombus crystal, which was over a hundred over feet tall! Looking at the huge and long snake-like cracks that were continuously forming, one could well imagine how shocking that must be.\\n\\n Finally, accompanying the violent rumbling sounds were countless green light dots that transformed into a strong life aura before dispersing in all directions. In mid-air, a figure came into view.\\n\\n It was not the hundred-plus feet tall figure of Mother Nature, but a petite woman who was about 1.6 meters tall, with two pairs of transparent wings on her back.\\n\\n She had long ears, and just like Mother Nature, she had long turquoise hair and blue eyes - even her outfit was the same as hers. She looked like a smaller version of Mother Nature – and just as good looking.\\n\\n However, she looked very ill and pale - her condition was even worse than Zhou Weiqing’s. Her body shuddered in the sky and a layer of gray air stream erupted from her body. She violently swayed twice in the air; only after spreading all four wings did she prevent herself from falling to the ground, albeit with much difficulty. At this moment, her blue eyes were filled with astonishment.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing heaved a huge sigh of relief. From the looks of it, the Sidhe Queen had suffered quite a substantial amount of damage as well. At the same time, a sense of pride crept over him. His opponent was a Heavenly God! Furthermore, she was not a Low Level Heavenly God. Not to forget, at the last moment, she had received help from the twelve sidhe elders in order to block the Sword of the Demon God’s attack. Zhou Weiqing was only but a Heavenly Emperor Stage Heavenly Jewel Master - he was very proud of his combat success.\\n\\n Of course, Zhou Weiqing was aware of his own weaknesses - he could not summon the Sword of the Demon God as he pleased. However, after witnessing the formidable power of the Sword of the Demon God, his heart was burning with passion. If he were one day able to fully master the Sword of the Demon God, he would have no equals in this world.\\n\\n “Who are you exactly? How could you control the Sword of the Demon God? Even the Sect Leader of Heavenly Demon Sect is not able to do that.” The Sidhe Queen’s voice was heard. At the same time, her pale hand waved in the air and a scepter landed in it. Faint green rays of light emerged once again. Just as she said, these were the sidhe’s sealed grounds after all. She used the tremendous amount of Life Energy to envelop the twelve sidhe elders and herself within it in an instant. Huge amounts of Life Energy could be seen constantly being channeled into their bodies, possibly to treat their injuries or restore their cultivation.\\n\\n Truth to be told, Zhou Weiqing possessing Saint Energy did not have much of an impact here.. If other Heavenly Jewel Masters had to face the Sidhe Queen head-on, they would not be able to absorb the natural elements within the sealed grounds at all. Zhou Weiqing could only do so because of his Saint Energy, and even then it was a struggle.\\n\\n Additionally, the reason why Zhou Weiqing summoned the Demon God earlier, instead of using Astral Energy directly, was because of the Parallel Space. He was not sure if he could truly summon Astral Energy within the Parallel Space, let alone draw support from it. Hence, he thought of summoning the Demon God instead. After all, he had already reached the Heavenly Emperor Stage - he should clearly have a stronger control over the Demon God compared to before, and that was validated by his combat success in the fight earlier. Unfortunately, he was still unable to fully control the Demon God. He was far from being as adept as the Sidhe Queen in terms of controlling Mother Nature.\\n\\n “I am Zhou Weiqing, a member of the Heavenly Bow Empire. Your Majesty, can we have a calm and peaceful discussion? You should be able to tell that while I might be unable to defeat each and every single one of you, if we want to leave, you will not be able to keep us here either.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s neither overbearing nor obsequious tone of voice rang in the air. At the same time, faint reddish golden light rays were emitted from his body, enveloping himself along with the five women.\\n\\n He had no choice but to release his Astral Energy. He was brazenly competing with the Sidhe Queen for the natural elements in the air to recover their strength. Otherwise, if his opponents fully recovered their strength while they were still exhausting a massive amount of energy, it might be too late for them to leave.\\n\\n Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s reddish golden Nebula Saint Energy, the Sidhe Queen’s pupils contracted. She mumbled, “Zhou Weiqing? The name ‘Zhou Weiqing’ is very familiar, I might have heard it somewhere before. You are…could it be that…ah! I remember now.”\\n\\n The Sidhe Queen’s soliloquy made Zhou Weiqing rather confused. At this time, the Sidhe Queen looked as though she had reached some sort of realization. Her gaze started to soften.\\n\\n “Do you know Phelia?\" The Sidhe Queen\u0027s question took Zhou Weiqing aback as well.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing stared at her in shock. “Of course I know her, she is my mother-in-law.”\\n\\n Next to Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er couldn’t help but utter, “Your Majesty, do you know my mother?”\\n\\n The look on the Sidhe Queen’s face softened even more. She looked at Tian’er and nodded, “You must be Tian’er.”\\n\\n Tian’er hurriedly nodded. She was pleasantly surprised, “You really know my mother?”The Sidhe Queen nodded her head gently and looked at both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er. She had a look of disbelief in her eyes, “Both of you actually managed to successfully achieve Saint Energy. It is unbelievable. Additionally, your cultivation base has advanced to such a high level. When I saw Phelia a year ago, she told me that the two of you might have found a way to train in Saint Energy. Never did I expect you to succeed in such a short period of time.”\\n\\n Tian’er impatiently asked, “Your Majesty, can you please tell me where my mother is?”\\n\\n Any child who had lost a mother’s love from a young age had experienced tremendous amount of pain. Tian’er’s thirst for maternal love was extremely strong.\\n\\n The Sidhe Queen lightly shook her head and said, “I am sorry, I cannot tell you where she is. Even if I told you, it would be hard for you to reach that place. However, since all of you possess Saint Energy, you might truly be able to help us.”\\n\\n Hearing her say “us” instead of referring only to Phelia, Zhou Weiqing’s interest was piqued.\\n\\n As she spoke, the Sidhe Queen descended to the ground alongside the twelve sickly-looking elders, landing right before Zhou Weiqing and company.\\n\\n The oldest looking sidhe elder went up to the Sidhe Queen and said in a low voice, “Your Majesty, Her Highness……”\\n\\n The Sidhe Queen shook her head and said, “Since she is Phelia’s daughter, she couldn’t possibly be the one who kidnapped my daughter. Additionally, can’t all of you tell? This human, Zhou Weiqing, had been showing mercy the entire time - he had not harm a single sidhe from the start.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing forced a smile, “Yes, Your Majesty. Even though we came here to ask a favor of you, we harbor no ill intentions. We did run into Her Highness earlier, but I hope you are able to give us a chance to explain ourselves.”\\n\\n Since she was well-acquainted with his mother-in-law, Zhou Weiqing had to be more courteous. Additionally, the sidhe were much stronger than he expected. If they had to fight to the death, they might not be able to defeat those powerful sidhe. After all, Zhou Weiqing could not fully summon the strength of the Sword of the Demon God just yet.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-278-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
