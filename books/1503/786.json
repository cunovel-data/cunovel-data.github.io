(2)","content":"The Peerless Heavy Cavalry’s nigh invulnerable defense could be said to allow them to be invincible in front of the Kalise and Bai Da forces. As for the Peerless Archers, even in the dark of the night, their accuracy was still decent. In such a situation, every salvo of arrows would take away the lives of several thousand enemies. With such terrifying lethal killing offense, the entire battle ended in only two hours. \\n\\n Ming Yu’s commands and directions in the battle were precise and exact in every particular way. With the main force of the army flanking all the way around to the back, the enemies did not even have the chance to escape. This was a complete victory, an absolute success indeed. \\n\\n The true fighting only last around two hours, and the rest of the time was sweeping the battlefield. \\n\\n The blazing flames lasted until dawn before they slowly extinguished, and the battle finally ended for good. \\n\\n When Ming Yu personally led the Heavenly Bow Empire military officers into the Heavenly Bow City, it signified the final revival of the Heavenly Bow Empire. At least, they had finally recovered all of their territories. \\n\\n In the next few days, all of them were toiling away busily. After all, not all of the Kalise and Bai Da forces were killed, and they had to deal with the prisoners, sweeping the battlefields, as well as reclaiming some of the last few smaller cities near the Heavenly Bow City, all of these had to be done. \\n\\n Ming Yu used three days to complete all these tasks. During this period of time, Zhou Weiqing remained in the Royal Palace, describing all of his experiences in the past few years to his father and the Emperor Di Lingfeng. \\n\\n “Princess Difuya is here.” A guard’s voice rang out in the meeting hall, and their gazes turned towards the entrance. \\n\\n Currently, in the meeting hall, only Di Lingfeng, Zhou Weiqing, Admiral Zhou, Xiao Yunchen and a few other top ranking officials were there. \\n\\n Previously, Difuya had been left in one of the safer cities in their backlines, and did not join the battle. In truth, Zhou Weiqing had never really placed much importance on this princess, and only when they had achieved victory did he order someone to escort Difuya back to the Heavenly Bow City. \\n\\n Hearing that his daughter had returned, Di Lingfeng’s face showed a rare excitement. However, very quickly the excitement was replaced by anger, and he sat there on the throne unmoving, a dark look on his face. \\n\\n “Father Emperor!” With a wail of sorrow, Difuya rushed in from outside, almost charging to her father’s side, holding her father’s legs as she sobbed, just like how Zhou Weiqing had held Admiral Zhou’s legs the other day. \\n\\n Di Lingfeng sat there without moving, allowing her to hug him though he remained silent. \\n\\n Admiral Zhou sat at the side, his brow furrowed, before he glanced at his son. \\n\\n After Zhou Weiqing had described all of his experiences to his father, Admiral Zhou’s attitude towards his son had gone through a subtle change. The previous stern and severe attitude had vanished, replaced with a gentle amiable feeling. Just like what the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya had said, no matter who it was, with a son like this, it was definitely something worth being proud of!\\n\\n Regarding Princess Difuya breaking the betrothal, Admiral Zhou was slightly unhappy in his heart. In the past, he did feel that his son could not match up to the princess, but now? His son was the youngest Heavenly King powerhouse in the world, how could he not be a match for her?!\\n\\n Towards Difuya, currently Admiral Zhou did not think much of her. \\n\\n Difuya was indeed of the Royal bloodlines! However, when the Heavenly Bow Empire had been in trouble, it was his son who had battled through all odds, experiencing wind and rain before finally succeeding in reviving the Empire. As the Princess of the Empire, what had she done? Perhaps she had not only not contributed, she had even dragged his son back. Such a daughter-in-law, it’s fine if they didn’t get her, since the betrothal was already broken then so be it. \\n\\n “Get lost, I don’t have a daughter like you!” Di Lingfeng suddenly raised his leg, sending Difuya tumbling to the ground. \\n\\n Difuya was totally stunned by her father’s actions, not even climbing up. Ever since she was young, the father who had doted on her the most had actually treated her like this?\\n\\n Di Lengfeng stood up abruptly, saying to Admiral Zhou: “Big Bro, I have no more face to have this girl join your Zhou Family. Let me beat her to death now, lest she insults the connection between us.” As he said that, Di Lingfeng drew his longsword, taking a step forward as he slashed downwards at Difuya. \\n\\n “Your Majesty, no!” Everyone cried out in alarm. \\n\\n In a flash, Zhou Weiqing held onto Di Lingfeng. “Godfather, what are you doing. Difuya did not do anything wrong. Even before our Empire fell into the mishap, she had not loved me. Everyone has their own likes, and her not liking me does not mean anything. Forced love does not last, furthermore she has already found her own happiness now. Our Heavenly Bow Empire has just revived successfully; these few years she has suffered enough, don’t blame her anymore.” \\n\\n Di Fengling’s expression was still ugly, but as he was hugged by Zhou Weiqing, he could not break free at all. Under such a circumstance, he could only stop, looking coldly at Difuya, saying: “Get out. I don’t want to see you again. From now on, the Heavenly Bow Empire no longer has you as a Princess.” \\n\\n Difuya was in shock, looking at her emotionless father, she wept bitterly as she turned and ran out. \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing sighed inwardly. Although he did not like Difuya at all, perhaps even hated her a little, he did not wish to see her end like this. However, Di Lingfeng was currently in a fit of anger, and he knew trying to persuade him was not going to make a difference now. \\n\\n Difuya left, and Di Fengling’s expression slowly calmed down. Sighing heavily, he said: “Weiqing, godfather has let you down! It’s all my fault, I never taught her properly since young.” His current emotions could only be described as highly conflicted. If Difuya could really marry Zhou Weiqing, then he could accept all that Zhou Weiqing had done easily. After all, Zhou Weiqing and Difuya’s future child would then inherit the future throne of the Heavenly Bow Empire. But now?\\n\\n These few days, Di Lingfeng had already learned clearly the current situation of the Heavenly Bow Empire. It could be said that the Heavenly Bow Empire was in its strongest state in all of history. However, as an Emperor, how much power did he have left? It was not only him, even Admiral Zhou was the same. Although Zhou Weiqing had handed over the all the power in his hands, they were still clear that no one else but Zhou Weiqing could really command the army. \\n\\n Di Lingfeng sat there in a daze momentarily. After a while, he seemed to make up his mind. Abruptly, he lifted up his head, looking at Zhou Weiqing and said: “Weiqing, Godfather has already decided. Amongst all my children, there isn’t a single one that is up to the mark, that is the reason why I have not chosen a heir up until now. From today onwards, you will be the crown prince of the Heavenly Bow Empire. After a few days, I will officially pass the throne to you.”\\n\\n “Ahh?” Zhou Weiqing was given a fright, and he could only stare with jaw agape at Di Fengling. On the other side, Admiral Zhou knelt down with a thud. “Your Majesty, that’s absolutely impossible.” \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing also hurriedly knelt down in front of Di Fengling. “Godfather, all that I did was what I was supposed to do. You can’t do that, and there is no need to. Furthermore, that is not my inclination. If you were to pass such a large Empire to me, what freedom would I have left? Do not worry, I will handle the army. As long as you do not change the commander, put absolute trust like I did in Admiral Ming Yu, then I can guarantee that the Heavenly Bow Empire will only grow stronger.”\\n\\n Di Lingfeng shook his head, pulling Zhou Weiqing and Admiral Zhou up to their feet. With kindly eyes, he looked at Zhou Weiqing as he said: “Child, I know your heart, but you have already done so much for the Empire. If I do not hand anything over, how could I face the world, the people? You do not need to say anything more, my mind is set. I also believe that if the Heavenly Bow Empire is under your rule, we will eventually become one of the strongest Empires in the entire Boundless Mainland.” \\n\\n Not only did Zhou Weiqing have the highest popularity in the Heavenly Bow Empire, he had a close connection with several of the larger Empires, including some of the Great Saint Lands. If he were to rule the Heavenly Bow Empire, it would definitely be of greatest benefit to the empire. After some struggle in his heart, Di Fengling made the best decision. After saying those words, he felt as if a load had been lifted from his heart. \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile as he said: “No, Godfather, please listen to me. Although I’m not willing to rule the Heavenly Bow Empire, that does not mean I will give up on exerting myself for her sake. This is my consideration. Why is the ZhongTian Empire and WanShou Empire so strong, so powerful? That is because behind them, they have the support of a Great Saint Land. In that case, why don’t we have a Great Saint Land of our own?” \\n\\n “Great Saint Land?” Hearing those words, Admiral Zhou and Di Lingfeng’s eyes lit up. \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing nodded, saying: “That’s right, a Great Saint Land. Perhaps from the current outlook of things, our power is far from being sufficient. However, the number of Jewel Masters we now have is no less than any large Empire. Of course, we can’t compare with the ZhongTian Empire, but at least we have already surpassed the Fei Li Empire.” \\n\\n “As long as we continue grooming them, we can only grow stronger and stronger. With Master and I holding down the fort in a Great Saint Lands, at least in terms of the highest end powerhouses we should be able to hold our own against the other Great Saint Lands. As time passes, I believe we can grow stronger. Furthermore, I am also a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master already, and I am also able to help those older Heavenly Jewel Master powerhouses extend their lives. Once that news spreads, I believe that it will not take long for us to reach the proper scale of an actual Great Saint Land. Of course, how to actually form and build this up, that will be my problems. As for the Empire, it is still best left to you. Otherwise, wouldn’t I be guilty of plotting to usurp the throne? As a citizen of the Heavenly Bow Empire, what I have done so far was all necessary. Don’t let me bear such an infamy!” \\n\\n Hearing those words, the resolve that Di Lingfeng had just set was shaken once more. Indeed, if the Heavenly Bow Empire was able to gain a Great Saint Land of its own, that was truly the power to hold their own against those large Empires!\\n\\n After some thought, just as Di Fengling was about to nod in agreement, all of a sudden a person dashed in from outside, not even waiting to be announced as he barged into the main hall. \\n\\n “Weiqing, no good, something has come up. Greetings Your Majesty, Admiral Zhou, please excuse Ming Yu’s breach of etiquette, but I am here to look for Weiqing on highly urgent matters.” \\n\\n The person who had just rushed in was indeed Ming Yu; only he would not be stopped by the guards!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-267-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
