Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, saying: “Big bro, you should know by now not to worry about me right? Such a person like me who is afraid of death, if there is any real danger, I will definitely avoid it as best I can. Furthermore, as a lone person, I will be a small, nondescript target, and with my cultivation level and power, I should not need a lot of time to distinguish myself. At that time, you all can join the army by my side much easier. After all, our Fei Li Battle Team had already put on quite a display in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. If we join the army together, wouldn’t it be very obvious to anyone who had watched the tournament?” Lin TianAo thought about it for a moment before saying: “You do have a point. Alright, we’ll do as you say. Rest assured, you can leave things here to me. When do you plan to join the army?” Zhou Weiqing said: “The earlier the better. Every day is critical, and the earlier I join, the earlier I can go about putting my plan into motion.” Lin TianAo nodded and said: “Very well. In the future, every day at sunrise I will dispatch someone to wait at the north gates for you. Once you have arranged everything in the army, you find a chance to come out to meet him and arrange things with us.” Zhou Weiqing narrowed his eyes slightly and said: “Alright then, that’s settled. In that case, I shall leave now. Big Bro, all you brothers and sisters, take care. I’ll see you soon.” With that, he turned around to leave. However, before he could even take a step, he felt a tug on his clothes. It was Shangguan Fei’er. “You may be right in not bringing the rest, but you must bring me along. I am not part of the Fei Li Battle Team anyway, one additional person will not be a problem.” Looking at the brightly lit eyes of Shangguan Fei’er, Zhou Weiqing felt a sense of helplessness. “Why are you following me around? Do you really think I am here to play around?” Shangguan Fei’er gave a humph and said: “Don’t think you can abandon me here. First of all, I must help Bing’er keep watch on you. Our ZhongTian Empire Army does recruit females as well, and we do not have any prejudices against promoting capable female officers as well. You, this fellow, are too much of a playboy. What if you find some other woman? Furthermore, you are now sneaking into our ZhongTian Army. As part of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, I need to keep watch on you, lest you do anything that is against our ZhongTian Empire’s benefit, then it will be too late for me to regret. In any case, I don’t care, I am following you in.” Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly as he glared at her: “Don’t give me all those noble reasons. Don’t think I don’t know, you must be thinking how interesting and fun joining the army will be, that’s why you want to follow me. Looking for something fresh to play with right?” Shangguan Fei’er flushed slightly; clearly Zhou Weiqing had hit the nail upon the head. However, she continued saying boldly: “So what? No matter what, I’m following you!” Indeed, Zhou Weiqing was helpless against Shangguan Fei’er. Let alone the fact that he wasn’t able to defeat her, even if he could, he couldn’t possibly beat her up right? Just looking at her, and how she looked totally like Bing’er, Zhou Weiqing’s heart would be too soft to actually strike her. “My dear Second Miss… please don’t play around. Even if your ZhongTian Army is liberal enough to let women join the army, that is still considered much rarer than males. Furthermore, even if you join the army, you can’t possibly stay with me too. No matter how liberal your ZhongTian Army is, they would not place a man and woman together in the same camp to stay.” Shangguan Fei’er grinned and said: “Heh heh, isn’t that easy? I’ll dress up as a man. You just wait!” After saying that, she spun around and ran off, disappearing in a flash. Seeing Shangguan Fei’er disappear, Zhou Weiqing immediately said to Lin TianAo in a low tone: “Big bro, I’ll head off first then. You all take care. Do help me train Ma Qun well. That fellow has talent after all, and if he works hard, he should do well in the future. I’ll leave some money here for everyone to get their required Consolidating Equipment Scrolls and Stored Skills, you take charge of it.” As he said that, he tossed his gold coin storage card to in TianAo before running off swiftly. Only a fool would really wait for Shangguan Fei’er to dress up and come out. If he didn’t seize this opportunity to run off, he wouldn’t be Zhou Weiqing. Lin TianAo watched as Zhou Weiqing’s figure disappeared into the distance, and couldn’t help but shake his head with a smile. “Alright, let’s go then. First we have to find a place to stay.” Little Miss Muddle Dou Dou looked at him hesitatingly and said: “If Weiqing goes… who will I look for to get food then?” Yun Li patted himself on the chest and said: “After he leaves, I’m still around. Don’t worry, if you want to eat something, just let me know.” Hearing that there was food, Dou Dou immediately smiled happily: “You are such a good person.” Lin TianAo stumbled and almost fell from that, and he turned to look at Yun Li before finally saying: “That girl is too naive, you better not bully her, otherwise I will not be able to account to Weiqing.” Yun Li said in a mix of embarrassment and irritation. “What? Do I look like someone who would do that?” “Yes!” Little Four, Drunken Bao, Ma Qun and the others chorused out loud at the same time. These few days, they had gotten used to each other, and it was common for them to tease each other. “Fine fine, you all just wait, don’t ask me to make Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for you all!” Ma Qun laughed heartily, saying: “Teacher Yun, your threat won’t work anymore. With food, with Dou Dou, there will be Scrolls!” Lin TianAo shook his head helplessly and said: “Alright, enough playing around. Let’s go look for a place to stay, so we can have a good rest after this long trip.” Hearing his words, the rest of the team finally stopped, and they headed into the Tian Bei City. It might seem like Zhou Weiqing had left in too much of a rush, without even giving much instructions to the rest. However, with Lin TianAo there, Zhou Weiqing did not have to worry. Lin TianAo was the steady bedrock of the team, and as long as he was there, Zhou Weiqing had absolute confidence that they would be fine. After entering the Tian Bei City, Zhou Weiqing quickly crossed through the streets. Although he was not familiar with the place, he knew that he just needed to head north. After all, the whole purpose of the Tian Bei City was to defend against the WanShou Empire in the north, and their northern wall would likely be where the army would be stationed. In order to join the army, that was where he would have to go to look for them. That was also the reason why Lin TianAo had arranged for their meeting to be in the north gates. Zhou Weiqing crossed through street after street swiftly, and before long, he could see the north gates in the distance. Taking a quick look back, he did not spot Shangguan Fei’er, and he heaved a sigh of relief, thinking to himself: Lucky I ran fast! Right at that moment, a hand appeared out of nowhere, grabbing onto his shoulder without warning. Zhou Weiqing’s senses were far beyond any ordinary person, even most Heavenly Jewel Masters of his cultivation level. Even so, he was unable to dodge the hand, which held down gently onto his shoulder, just happening to grip onto his clavicle acupuncture point. Although his Clavicle acupuncture point energy whirlpool was able to dissipate a large amount of the strength, Zhou Weiqing still felt almost half his body go numb. Without looking back, his face already had a depressed look. It seems like no matter what, he would not be able to dodge the bullet. Those hands of Shangguan Fei’er which had tortured him in the past few days of teaching him… he was just too familiar with them.
