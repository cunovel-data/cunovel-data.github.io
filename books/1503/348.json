(2) Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s body burst forth with a brilliant silver light, as if his entire body had turned into a beam of silver. Originally, under the Tornado Strike, his speed had already been extremely fast. However, when the silver light enveloped him, his speed actually rose to a whole new level, his entire body like a shuttle, piercing through the air. The Wind Attribute Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master had just released his Consolidated Shield, and a silver light flashed before his eyes. He had not even seen what had happened clearly, and all he felt as a sudden cold invading his entire body. Breaking Shield, Instant Death. Zhou Weiqing’s body appeared behind the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master. His speed had just been too fast, and he had only activated it when he was already near the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master. As such, the two Skills from his enemies that had been locked onto Zhou Weiqing actually smashed onto the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master as well. An ear splitting slicing sound rang out, but no screams of pain resounded together. In truth, the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master had already lost the ability to scream as soon as Zhou Weiqing passed right through him. Struck by both the Demonic Wind Ring and Purple Yin Flames, the final end of the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master was no better than the previous Strength Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, with nothing much left of him but pieces. The Skill that Zhou Weiqing had used was the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce, and it was the Fourth Wind Attribute Skill that he had Stored. [1. It’s been a while, so quick reminder: First seen in Chapter 39.1, Wind Attribute Skill of the Silver Emperor Heavenly Beast.] Ever since Zhou Weiqing had met with the Silver Emperor in the Fei Li City’s Skill Storing Palace, he had been greatly attracted by the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce; it was after all one of the Silver Emperor’s three great skills. Alas, at that time, he could only choose two out of its three Skills, and he had no choice but to give it up then. This time, when he had reached the Four-Jeweled cultivation level, he had managed to find another Silver Emperor in the Heavenly Jewel Island Skill Storing Palace, and he had succeeded in Storing it this time. As such, he now had all three of a Silver Emperor’s greatest skills. The Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce: Wind Attribute Skill of the Silver Emperor. Able to warp into a silver point, instantly piercing through anything. At the same time, moving at 300% speed. This is a skill that can be used for both offense and defense, and the Silver Emperor uses it for both attacking and fleeing The reason why Zhou Weiqing chose it was not just because of its unbelievable piercing powers, but also because of that instantaneous burst of speed it granted. Of course, at his power levels, that would only last for an extremely short period, but in a critical moment, it could actually help save his life as well if used to flee. Zhou Weiqing was very clear about his own situation, and the sheer danger he was in. He knew that he had to plan for the worst, and as such, when he reached the Four-Jeweled stage, in choosing his new Skills to Store, he had placed a greater importance on Skill that could help protect himself, especially when being hunted down by his enemies. The Tornado Strike in addition to the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce was an unbelievable boost to his speed and offensive capabilities, and with the Giant Spirit Yang Palm spearheading the attack, it was not something that could be easily taken on head-on by any ordinary six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, unless one had a powerful offensive or defensive Skill to deal with it. Alas, his enemy was neither a close combat or defensive specialist. Their attacks were still chasing Zhou Weiqing, and needed to be controlled, but before they could hit, Zhou Weiqing had actually managed to kill a second enemy. Zhou Weiqing naturally had his reasons for choosing the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master - he was the one who gave him the sense of being a greatest threat, especially after seeing that he had a Control Skill, and not just one. Zhou Weiqing might seem to be on the upper hand, with his myriad of powerful Skills, but he was also a careful person. He knew that if he got caught by any Control Skill, then he would be easily brought down and killed by an onslaught of attacks, outnumbered as he was. As such, after taking down his first enemy, he had quickly decided to finish off this Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master next. The four remaining black clad men were dumbfounded. From the start of the fight, though so many things had happened, it had been only slightly more than ten seconds, and already two of their companions had been slaughtered. What Zhou Weiqing brought to them was a feeling that he could not be stopped. Of course, Zhou Weiqing’s actions would not stop at that; after killing off the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, he was not that far off from the Ranged Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, though they had tried to separate themselves. However, after using so many powerful Skills in rapid succession, the Heavenly Energy he had Devoured previously had been fully depleted, and even his own Heavenly Energy was almost used up. The Devour Skill was known as the most powerful Skill of the entire Demonic Attribute, and it truly deserved its name. Although it did not seem to have a great offensive power, it was without a doubt that it was this Skill alone that had helped Zhou Weiqing to face so many powerful enemies. Without it, the only choice he would have would be to run for his life. After all, no matter how powerful he was, he was at a lower level than them. Even if he could kill off one or two enemies with his many powerful highly rated Skills, he would quickly run out of Heavenly Energy. Despite having so many Skills at his disposal, once he ran out of Heavenly Energy, they would all be useless. Yet, with the Devour Skill, Zhou Weiqing was able to constantly replenish his energy in the midst of combat. As long as he managed to activate it on his enemies, he would be able to continuously fight at peak power and use these high powered Skills. Stamping his right foot on the ground, Zhou Weiqing shot forth like a cannonball towards his target, the Ranged Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master. Zhou Weiqing’s performance earlier had just been too impressive, and the Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master was shocked and afraid. Quickly pointing his staff at the rapidly advancing Zhou Weiqing, he did not care about saving Heavenly Energy, swiftly launching three powerful Fire Attribute Skills one after the other at him. Previously, the two airborne enemies who had been blocked by Zhou Weiqing’s arrows finally landed onto the ground, and they charged forth from the back together with the melee Heavenly Jewel Master. In their eyes, Zhou Weiqing was only at the Four-Jeweled stage, and despite all his power, after unleashing so many powerful Skills, he had to be running low on Heavenly Energy. At this point, their confidence in killing off Zhou Weiqing was even higher. These three black clad men were obviously not well versed in ranged combat. Most Heavenly Jewel Masters would only specialize in one; taking Zhou Weiqing as an example, if one only considered his Skills alone, he did not have much ranged Skills at all. However, he had his outstanding archery to complement him, and with the Overlord Bow, he was able to more than offset this ‘weak point’ of his. The explosive power of the Demonic Right Leg was so strong, and it sent Zhou Weiqing’s body hurtling almost instantly into the midst of the Fire Attribute Skill, and he was just about to be struck by it without chance of evasion. Right at that moment, all the remaining black clad men were surprised to see another dark glow aura spring up around Zhou Weiqing’s body, blocking all the Fire Attribute Skills. It was another Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura! This time, what appeared was the Giant Spirit Yin Palm of the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms around his left arm. From the surface, it looked exactly the same as the Giant Spirit Yang Palm, dark gold coloured armor, with the glove area tipped with the sharp thick claws. With the aid of his second Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, Zhou Weiqing was able to charge to the front of the Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master. Once a melee specialist Heavenly Jewel Master managed to close in onto a ranged specialist Heavenly Jewel Master, one could imagine the result; let alone with them having a prior example. However, it was Zhou Weiqing’s turn to be surprised. The Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master did not look surprised or afraid, instead his lips turned upwards in a cold smirk. At that point, a thick burst of fire exploded out from his body, warping into a ring spreading outwards in all directions. The golden flames brought an intense heat, but more so a repulsive force that pushed backwards violently. It was the rare Fire Attribute protective Skill, shoving enemies away from oneself, one of the prime skills for ranged combat Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Masters. The Fire Ring of Repulsion Skill. A huge backward-pushing force repulsing all assailed him from all directions. This was a highly rated Skill powered by the six-Jeweled cultivation stage after all! With enemies behind him, and the Fire Ring of Repulsion blocking him from the front, Zhou Weiqing was momentarily in a dangerous state. A piercing silver light appeared without warning from Zhou Weiqing’s right palm, along with an earsplitting tearing sound across the air, reverberating across the area as a silver tear appeared, almost four yards along, ripping into the Fire Ring of Repulsion, causing the powerful backward force to slide past Zhou Weiqing harmlessly instead. Leaping up and contorting his body to squeeze through in a flash, Zhou Weiqing was abruptly in front of the Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, his hands in front of his opponent’s horrified face. His palms smashed down onto each shoulder, and with the Giant Spirit Palm’s piercing power and sheer strength, along with the Demonic Change State’s physique, he instantly broke through the shield, and with an accompanying shriek of agony from the Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, he grabbed onto his shoulders forcibly. By now, the Fire Ring of Repulsion, originally meant to knock Zhou Weiqing away, was now a detriment and downfall to the Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, instead helping to keep his companions away, blocking the three black clad men. At this point, no one could save his life any longer. Such a massive expenditure of energy, Zhou Weiqing needed to replenish it as soon as possible in order to keep fighting, and immediately he activated the Devour Skill. Both side’s Heavenly Energy had a certain gap between them, but the Demonic Change State and Devour Skills had both been raised up to the four-Jeweled stage, and the Devour Skill’s draining rate had been raised drastically. Adding to that the boost from Zhou Weiqing’s Legendary Set’s Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palm, as well as the momentary dazed senses of the Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master from having both shoulders smashed, he was not able to resist the Devour Skill. A large amount of Heavenly Energy flowed into Zhou Weiqing, re-nourishing his body and replenishing the substantial Heavenly Energy that he had already used in this short fight, almost topping him to full again. Although this Heavenly Energy did not belong to him, as long as he used it in a short period of time, it would be no different in terms of his combat strength. It was not just his Heavenly Energy which was Devoured, along with it came the black clad man’s life force as well. As the time passed, the difference in power between the two grew, and they could clearly see the black clad man’s body withering, starting from his shoulders. When that withering effect reached his chest, his heart was instantly torn apart by the two suction forces from both sides, and with a spurt of blood, the black clad man died. Zhou Weiqing’s hatred for these Bai Da Empire enemies were at an all time high, and his attacks were savage and vicious. The Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palm pulled apart in an outward motion, tearing the enemy into two, before tossing his remains behind casually. Six versus one. Seemingly insurmountable odds. Yet, in just a short period of time, Zhou Weiqing had already killed off three enemies. What kind of terrifying power was that? As compared to when he had been in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, Zhou Weiqing’s power had already increased by leaps and bounds, and facing these ordinary six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters, he was no longer had to fear them.
