{"id":51915,"no":741,"title":"Chapter 251: Heavenly God Self-Detonation (2)","content":"Chapter 251 – Heavenly God Self-Detonation (2) Zhou Weiqing continued to hover in midair. He was located right in the chest of that enormous gray figure, which seemed to be like his background. Heaven and Earth had turned gray, while the light of the sun and moon both vanished. The only thing which filled the vast sea was a boundless Demonic energy. Yes. Zhou Weiqing had once more summoned the Demon God to descend upon the world. The Demon God. The Ward of the Demon God had summoned the Demon God. Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy had been virtually exhausted, but he could clearly sense that this Demon God was completely different from the ones of the past. Last time he had summoned the Demon God, a mere image of it had appeared for an instant. This time, he had suffered the true projection of the Demon God. It no longer was limited to just a single second. The enormous image of the Demon God stood silently behind Zhou Weiqing, but this was already enough. What surprised Zhou Weiqing was that when the Demon God had appeared, all of the Saint Energy in his body had completely evaporated and then poured into the Demon God. But of course, once the Demon God had actually appeared, all Attributes of atmospheric energies in the sea and in the heavens began to flood towards the Demon God’s body with terrifying, inconceivable speed. Zhou Weiqing was impacted by this as well. The Saint Energy in his body had already been squeezed try, and now it greedily absorbed all these disparate types of atmospheric energies and furiously converted them to replenish his own stores. The Saint Energy in his body actually seemed to be turning even purer as a result. The astral silver light now glowed even more dazzlingly, while the thirty-six Death Acupuncture Points no longer rotated so madly. Instead, they transformed into thirty-six holes of pure devouring power which swallowed all types of atmospheric bodies into his body. In truth, Zhou Weiqing himself didn’t realize that the reason he was able to accomplish this wasn’t because of the Saint Energy’s revival abilities. Instead, it was because of his own bloodline. Zhou Weiqing’s own body contained the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline. This was a bloodline which was on par with the Dragon Emperor Bloodline… and the most powerful aspect of the Dark Demon God Tiger’s Bloodline was the strand of the Demon God Lineage. It could be said that under this tremendous pressure, all of Zhou Weiqing’s latent power had been fully activated. He had been able to merge together that strand of the Dark Demon God Lineage into his own Saint Energy, and as a result was able to summon a true projection of the Demon God. This was the true Demon God, something which eclipsed all Heavenly Gods. Even though it was a mere projection which couldn’t actually fight on Zhou Weiqing’s behalf, its appearance caused all atmospheric energies to obey its bidding unless an aura which was on par with it appeared. Right. This Demon God projection couldn’t even help Zhou Weiqing with a single attack, which the projections he had summoned when he was young and weak were capable of. However... its aura and majesty was that of the true Demon God’s. It didn’t NEED to launch any attacks. As soon as it appeared the Terror Sea Dragon dove into the seas, completely overwhelmed by fear. It didn’t dare to launch any further attacks against Zhou Weiqing. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing himself was immersed in a marvelous state. Just ten seconds later, all of the Saint Energy he had exhausted was completely replenished, and it was actually increased by a certain degree. More importantly, his Saint Energy had become even purer. He could vaguely sense that he could ‘touch’ the edges of the thirty-eighth level. Demon God. Have I truly revived the Demon God? However, he quickly realized that he was wrong. He was completely incapable of maintaining any sort of connection with the Demon God which had appeared behind him. In fact, there wasn’t even a voice in his mind like there had been the previous time. Zhou Weiqing felt a bit depressed, but the entire battlefield had changed due to the Demon God he had summoned. First of all, the Terror Sea Dragon that was responsible for reinforcing the first one had been terrified into diving deep into the oceans. It didn’t even dare to try and flee. Instead, it curled up into a ball within the sea, releasing all of its energies to try and resist the terrible, corrosive power of the Demon God. On the other side, the Tenebrous Sealing Formation was partially formed from the Demonic Attribute. Now that the world outside suddenly became suffused with the Demonic Attribute, the sealing formation’s power almost instantly skyrocketed. The Terror Sea Dragon within it had already been at a disadvantage; now, the sudden increase in pressure put it in an incredibly dangerous position. However, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake had finally realized what was going on at Zhou Weiqing’s side. When they saw the all-encompassing gray figure which had appeared outside the Tenebrous Sealing Formation and Zhou Weiqing standing within it, they couldn’t help but slow down their attacks. H-he actually managed to stop the Terror Sea Dragon. What power is this? How can it be this terrifying? None of the Xuantian Palace powerhouses knew how Zhou Weiqing had done this. They were no longer capable of evaluating exactly how powerful he was… and right at this moment, the Terror Sea Dragon in the Tenebrous Sealing Formation finally exploded with power. Any creature, when faced with certain death, wouldn’t just lie down for its killers. This was doubly true for Heavenly Gods. As the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake paused for a moment in shock, an incredibly dense streak of deep blue light suddenly shot out of the centermost part of the Terror Sea Dragon’s body. This blue light looked completely different from anything else. No one had ever seen this blue color, and it gave off a feeling of coziness and clarity. A terrifying ripple of energy instantly spread outwards, and with each transformation of the energy the Terror Sea Dragon’s giant body would shudder. Layers of this azure light blasted out unabated from within its body, while the terrifying aura emanating from it seemed about ready to tear through the recently-strengthened formation. What was this?! The Tenebrous Demon Dragon cried out in shock, “Not good. It is going to self-detonate its Heavenly Core Nucleus. Quick, stop it!” At a time like this, Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon didn’t dare to hold anything back at all. If the Terror Sea Dragon succeeded in this self-detonation, most likely no one within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation would survive. Dense bloody light shot into the air, while the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s body almost instantly lost its luster. However, the blood-red light instantly poured into Dreamwake’s body, then flooded into the Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear. “Die!” Dreamwake cried in her lovely voice, letting the Dragon Spear explode with incomparably dazzling light. The devilish blood-colored light grew brighter, while the Dragon Spear shot out of Dreamwake’s hands and instantly transformed into an enormous spear which was fifty meters long and glowed with blood-red light. It instantly traversed the distance between her and the Terror Sea Dragon. The Terror Sea Dragon had chosen to self-detonate its Heavenly Core Nucleus at the very last moment, while the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake had activated this attack called ‘Extermination’. Previously, they had held back and not used it. Even when the other Terror Sea Dragon had appeared and posed an enormous risk to them, they still hadn’t used it. This was because once they used this attack, Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s power would instantly drop by 90%. To them, this was essentially an attack that came from their core essence. Once ‘Extermination’ shot out, victory or defeat would be determined. It had set alight all of the Heavenly Energy within Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake, which had been poured into this single attack. You can imagine how incredible it was! An ear-piercing screech rang out as the Terror Sea Dragon made its response. Although it had yet to truly activate all the energies within its Heavenly Core Nucleus, it still chose to self-detonate. Otherwise, once it was hit by this ‘Extermination’ attack, it wouldn’t even have the chance to self-detonate. Anyone watching from afar would be able to see with clarity how the entire surface of the sea suddenly shuddered violently. All of the black light within the enormous Tenebrous Sealing Formation suddenly contracted as an incomparably terrifying explosion blasted out of it. Even though it had suffered from the ‘Extermination’ attack and had been locked away by the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, this remained a Heavenly God powerhouse’s self-detonation! The terrifying explosive force caused all living beings to shudder. In an instant, an utterly vast azure mushroom cloud that was completely formed from water and a thousand meters tall suddenly appeared within the sea. The terrifying azure light contained a mixture of black, gray, and blood-colored light, and it instantly expanded outwards. All living beings within a hundred meters were almost instantly crushed into dust and killed by this terrifying power, leaving nothing behind. Utter misery. This was true, utter misery for all living beings. As for the giant gray figure that had towered over all things, it too was annihilated by that terrifying blast. The Demon God projection only had the Demon God’s aura; it wasn’t capable of enduring any attacks at all. Given Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base, how could he possibly summon the actual power of the Demon God, even if he did use Saint Energy? The point of this Demon God projection was to make it so that your enemies wouldn’t even dare to think about attacking you. However, once the Terror Sea Dragon’s self-detonation appeared the Demon God projection was destroyed. Thankfully, its brief appearance had been summoned by Zhou Weiqing via the Ward of the Demon God. As soon as that terrifying blast had appeared, all of the Demonic energy quickly wrapped around Zhou Weiqing and did its best to protect him. It was at times like this that Zhou Weiqing’s natural toughness revealed itself. Dragon-Tiger Transformation. Immortal Deity Shield. Ward of the Demon God. All of these powerful defensive techniques overlaid on each other. Although he was sent flying by that terrifying explosion of energy, he didn’t suffer any actual injuries. Of course, this was also because the Terror Sea Dragon’s self-detonation hadn’t been fully successful in drawing out all the energy within its Heavenly Core Nucleus, and it had also been weakened by the ‘Extermination’ attack and the Tenebrous Sealing Formation. Otherwise, the field of death wouldn’t have been a mere hundred kilometers in size. Heavenly God powerhouses were, by nature, figures with unearthly levels of power! The death of such a figure could unleash an absolutely indescribable amount of destructive energies. Simply put… if this had happened on land, the self-detonation of something as powerful as a Terror Sea Dragon would’ve been able to wipe out at least half the Fei Li Empire. You can imagine how powerful it was!
