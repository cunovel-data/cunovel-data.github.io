Towards this daughter he had been parted from for so many years, his heart was filled with love and affection. “Foolish girl, although we father and daughter have only just been reunited, but how can I not see your feelings for him? I am helping you. You must know, an outstanding man is like a sharp blade, only when it is ground will it become sharper. When you have to fight for something, only then will you treasure it more. Of course, there is one line that I was not joking about. To be my Shangguan Tianyue’s son in law, it isn’t so easy. I am your father, don’t I have the right to give the man my daughter loves some tests?” Listening to and thinking about Shangguan Tianyue’s words, Shangguan Bing’er’s expression finally warmed slightly. In the next moment, a soothing gentle white light surrounded them once more, and the surroundings turned hazy. The three of them disappeared in a flash once more. Shangguan Tianyue did tell his daughter one thing. If not for the fact that they had already been intimate, perhaps Shangguan Tianyue might not have even given him that chance. ... When Shangguan Tianyue and his daughters left, Zhou Weiqing stood there. His breath had calmed down, but he had entered a strange state. There was no anger. At this moment, he had no anger, no negative emotions in his heart. In his eyes, the only thing that sparked was a cold calmness that had never been there before. Although Shangguan Tianyue had said all that to him, and brought Shangguan Bing’er away, Zhou Weiqing did not hate him at all. The reason was very simple, at that point when Shangguan Tianyue had grabbed him by the neck, Zhou Weiqing suddenly thought of something. If he was Shangguan Tianyue, if he were in the same shoes, perhaps, he would be even worse than Shangguan Tianyue! Without exception, any father would not feel good when his daughter was being married off, and would always be extremely careful when picking a son in law. Furthermore, Shangguan Bing’er was so beautiful, and Shangguan Tianyue had also been separated from his daughter for so many years. One could imagine how much love he had for her, yet at that point he was greeted with the sight of an unknown son in law, who looked so unexceptional, how could he possibly be happy. All he must be thinking should be ‘I’ve finally found my daughter after so long, how can she be snatched away by another man!’ After thinking about that, Zhou Weiqing could no longer bring himself to hate Shangguan Tianyue. Of course, not hating him did not mean he did not take the words to heart. Shangguan Tianyue’s words had stabbed deeply into his heart. From the time that Shangguan Xue’er appeared to Shangguan Tianyue taking Bing’er away, the entire process gave Zhou Weiqing a lot of information. At this point, he was extremely calm, and was analysing everything. Fat Cat’s strange actions aside, it was without question that Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Bing’er were sisters. Also, from what Shangguan Xue’er said, there was yet another sister, and with her calling Bing’er third younger sister, that meant they were triplets, not twins! That was to say, there was another sister looking exactly like them, and her name should be Shangguan Fei’er. Shangguan Xue’er, Fei’er and Bing’er, three sisters. Zhou Weiqing touched his swollen red cheeks and couldn’t help but feel rather speechless at the whole happenings. In the future when he met Shangguan Bing’er again, he would have to make sure before doing anything, lest he made the mistake again and got himself beaten up again! As he thought up to this point, Zhou Weiqing’s mouth moved upward in a strange smile, as the pain in his heart was slightly diminished. He was thinking to himself: If I marry Bing’er in the future, will we also have twins or triplets? Perhaps that is hereditary as well! The next thought that struck Zhou Weiqing was this: Who exactly was Shangguan Tianyue. Earlier, the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion Managers had called him Second Palace Master. Without question, in the ZhongTian Empire, the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion had equal rank to the Skill Storing Palace. As such, if Shangguan Tianyue was just the Second Palace Master of the Skill Storing Palace, he shouldn’t be treated so respectfully and a little afraid by those Consolidating Equipment Pavilion Managers. If he was not from the Skill Storing Palace, then what other palace could have such a powerhouse like Shangguan Tianyue? There could only be one answer, the ZhongTian Empire’s protector and backer, the true boss of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, one of the Great Saint Lands, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace! If Shangguan Tianyue was the Second Palace Master of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, then everything made sense. From his name, according to the usual sun, moon, star placement [1. This kind of chinese, basically the yue (月) in Tianyue means moon, and xing(星) in Tianxing means star. I’m not sure what’s the placement, but I guess it’s Sun (日ri）\u003e Moon \u003e Star from the context, probably from ancient times when they’re just comparing size (my guess)], he was likely to be the Emperor Shangguan Tianxing’s elder brother. That meant that there could possibly a third brother, an older one? Could they also be triplets? Could the eldest brother be called Shangguan Tianri? Such a terrible name! [2. Pun master Zhou Weiqing at work again, 日 ri also is a slang for having sex] The Second Palace Master of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Such a title… just thinking about it caused Zhou Weiqing’s heart to twitch a little. His Bing’er was not just a princess of the ZhongTian Empire, but also of direct lineage of the leaders of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace! How powerful was the Heaven’s Expanse Palace? From Shangguan Xue’er, it was easy to tell. After all, she was triplets with Shangguan Bing’er, that meant she was only nineteen as well, yet she had already reached the seven Jewel cultivation level! At that age! Zhou Weiqing knew his talent was outstanding, and with the Immortal Deity Technique which was extremely fast, but he knew that when he reached nineteen years old, he would definitely not be able to reach the seven Jewel cultivation level without any miracles. With all the analysis and judgements in mind, only then did Zhou Weiqing truly understanding the daunting task that lay before him, and to truly understand how Shangguan Tianyue felt as he spoke. To be his son in law, or to be clearer, to be the Heaven’s Expanse Palace son in law, that was definitely not an easy task. “Bing’er, wait for me. I will definitely let your father see my power. You are my wife, and no one will ever be able to take you away from me, not even your father. Furthermore, I will not marry into the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, but have you marry to [email protected] [3. This might not make sense to most readers, but this is actually a big deal in Chinese culture / tradition. Generally, the wife (and children) will take the Male side of the family name in any traditional marriage. To marry into the female side of the family is usually only when there is a disparity in ‘power’ or ‘status’, and is somewhat of a social stigma. In that case, he would become Shangguan Weiqing, taking the family name of Shangguan. My translation might thus sound a little awkward as well, since I don’t think there is a proper corresponding phrase in English (please correct me if I’m wrong)] After muttering that to himself, Zhou Weiqing shook himself, waving his right arm as the stubborness deep within his bones was sparked out. His character had always been one a stubborn purpose who grew in adversity, and in this, he was extremely similar to his father Admiral Zhou. Originally, when Admiral Zhou had asked him to learn under the God Eye Scoundrel Mu En, it was because he was afraid that his son could not cultivate, and with the same character and disposition as himself, would get him into trouble that he could not handle. However, although Zhou Weiqing had learned to be scared of death, to learn all the survival methods, the roguish and scoundrelly ways of Mu En, deep inside, some things in the character could not be changed. After all, in his body flowed Admiral Zhou’s blood! … When Zhou Weiqing returned to the inn, he directly went to Lin TianAo’s room. When he pushed open the door and entered, he discovered that all the Fei Li Battle Team members besides Crow were present. Seeing Zhou Weiqing return was no big deal, but when the members saw the slap imprint and swollen face of his, they all had interesting expressions on their faces. Drunken Bao raised a brow, saying: “Weiqing, what evil things did you do? Looking at your swollen face, with such a slim hand imprint, that has to be a female. Heh heh heh.” Little Four was even more direct, laughing out loud as he said: “Weiqing, you already have Bing’er, how can you still go around trying to pick up chicks. That is totally wrong, our team still has Crow, why go around looking for others instead of close by. Hmmm, although maybe that was a good decision of yours, with Crow’s large hands, if she slapped you like that… Hahahahahaha!” Ye Paopao and Lin TianAo did not say anything, just looking at him with an amused look on their faces. Surprisingly, the one who spoke last was the usually quiet Xiao Yan, though he only said simply: “I wonder if that swelling will subside in three days.” After all, if in three days the slap imprint had not subsided, if Zhou Weiqing went on the stage to fight, he would not only be throwing his own face, but also the faces of the entire Fei Li Empire! Zhou Weiqing said gloomily: “Don’t you all have any compassion? After all, I did just bring us our first victory!” Little Four put his arm around Drunken Bao’s shoulder as he continued saying laughingly: “Who has compassion for perverts! Haha… looking at you, although you were slapped, but there is no hate in your eyes. Added to the fact that it is a woman’s palm print, there can only be one possibility, you were making a move on a woman and got hit, right? Since that is so, who will have compassion for you?” Zhou Weiqing said angrily: “You guys! Hmph, I shall not talk about it anymore. Leader, I came here to tell you something. In the future matches, Bing’er will not be able to join us any further. Just now, we met her long lost relatives, and she was brought home.” Lin TianAo said curiously: “Meeting relatives? That shouldn’t affect the tournament right?” Although Shangguan Bing’er’s personal offense capability was likely the weakest in the entire team, but without a doubt in any team fight or two versus two fight, her amazing archery skills was definitely not to be underestimated. Suppressing the enemy, harassing them, or supporting her teammates, those were things she excelled at. Losing such a talent, especially at their current state, it was definitely not good news for the team. Zhou Weiqing said gloomily: “If the relatives were anyone else, it wouldn’t matter. However, the problem is that her relatives are from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and as long lost relatives, I do not even know when she will return. We had better make preparations that she might not be able to join us for any further fights.” Hearing the three words of Heaven’s Expanse Palace, everyone’s expression changed. Lin TianAo thought for a moment, then said: “Weiqing, what about the second fight. What is your plan?” Zhou Weiqing said: “To be safe, I’d like leader to join us. If the three of us aren’t able to handle it, we may need you to take action.” Lin TianAo nodded and said: “That is probably for the best. En… Weiqing… you… should go heal the wound on your face. You can go to the Skill Storing Palace and pay some money to look for a Life Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, that will heal such a small wound in a short period of time.” As he said that, he couldn’t help but give a wry smile.
