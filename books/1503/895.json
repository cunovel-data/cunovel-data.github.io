(2)","content":"At that time, when she was offered to Zhou Weiqing, sacrificing herself for him, even though she was unable to resist him, she personally did not want to either. That was because she was sure that if there was a man in this world who would be good enough for her, it would definitely be that fella. Hence, she did not reject or resist him.\n Thereafter, she left and had not seen Zhou Weiqing for a very long period of time. That was when she gradually learned how it felt to yearn for someone.\n When she had seen Zhou Weiqing again, even though they did not get intimate, Zhou Weiqing had promised that he would take responsibility for her. However, seeing as how he had several female companions by his side, Little Witch had always harbored a grudge within her heart as she lacked self-confidence. She was not sure if she could receive much love from Zhou Weiqing.\n Perhaps Zhou Weiqing was indeed a philanderer - to the point where she wanted to beat him up. However, ultimately, he managed to leave some room in his heart for her. Now he had left, and it was unclear whether or not he could come back alive. At this moment, Little Witch had a sudden realization that he had taken her heart with him.\n As it turns out, I do truly love him. I don’t know when I started actually falling for him. And that I did not choose to marry him and be his wife for the sake of the future of the Heavenly Demon Sect.\n Unknowingly, tears fell down her cheeks. At this moment, she was completely unconscious of the look on her face - she was not wearing any expression; tears trickled down her face continuously, akin to a broken string of pearls.\n “Sister——” Shangguan Bing’er pounced into Shangguan Fei’er’s embrace as she cried out in pain, “Little Fatty had abandoned us, he had left on his own. Sister, I…I want to look for him. Can we look for him together?”\n Shangguan Bing’er looked beggingly with her eyes, as though Shangguan Fei’er was her last hope.\n Shangguan Fei’er said ferociously, “Look for him? What for? He ran off without us, so why should we look for him? That bastard should just go to hell. It’s best if he never returns, lest he makes us sad. Bing’er, you’re not allowed to look for him.”\n Despite what she said, Bing’er could clearly feel that at this very moment, Fei’er’s body was trembling, somewhat uncontrollably.\n Shangguan Xue’er had a different reaction compared to her two sisters. After she regained consciousness, she was in a dazed for a brief moment. Thereafter, she gently touched her lips that were kissed by Zhou Weiqing, as she gradually walked towards the edge of the abyss. It was as though her entire body was like a puppet.\n “Xue’er.” Shangguan Tianyang stood in front of her and blocked her. He did not allow her to advance any farther. “Children, you need to calm yourselves down. The reason why Weiqing did what he did was because he did not want you to risk your lives with him. He possesses the true Saint Energy, which allows him to have the ability to deal with the Lord of the Nether. All of you are different - your Saint Energy is not pure. He is only concerned about your safety! If you went to look for him, you will only hinder him and affect his state of mind. Even though I do not approve of his philandering ways, I can confidently say that he might die from heartbreak if any of you were to die. Right now, there is nothing else we can do but wait here for his return.\n “There is no need to be too pessimistic either. The purpose of his trip there is to help the Dragon Emperor strengthen the seal, not to fight against the Lord of the Nether. That fella has always been blessed with good luck. I believe he will come back alive.”\n Shangguan Xue’er did not stop walking despite Shangguan Tianyang’s attempt to stop her. Instead, she went around him. She only voluntarily stopped in her tracks when he tried to stop her again. She stood on the edge of the abyss, staring straight down.\n Shangguan Xue’er did not cry. However, her entire body was extremely stiff. She was the only person who knew what she was thinking at this moment.\n She was regretting; regretting the fact that she did not outsmart him - that she did not expose that bastard’s plans and obeyed his wishes instead.\n Amongst all Zhou Weiqing’s wives, she was the only person who did not have an actual intimate relationship with him. She was truly regretting everything. Since she was a child, she had been living for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. In order to become the next successor of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she had continuously worked very hard. When she had grown up and became sensible, she assumed that there was not a single man she would ever fall for in this world. The only thing she had on her mind was to bring the Heaven’s Expanse Palace to greater heights and protect its honor and glory.\n However, ever since she met Zhou Weiqing, it seemed as though everything had changed. He had constantly tugged on her heartstrings. She could clearly remember everything that happened between them during that time when she had lost a bet to him. She did not only lose herself, but her heart too. At that time, it was impossible for her to acknowledge that defeat. However at this moment, she was clear that that was when he had truly entered her heart.\n Since she liked him, why was she still adamant about being so reserved, instead of giving herself entirely to him? Weiqing, you have to come back alive.\n Subconsciously, Shangguan Fei’er clenched both fists. Her face was as pale as snow.\n Dongfang Hanyue was different from the other four women - she had already calmed herself down a long time ago. While she similarly stared in the direction of the abyss, she would also look in the direction of Xuantian Continent every now and then. Looking at the reactions of the three Shangguan sisters and Little Witch, she suddenly rejoiced in her heart. Perhaps she did not receive as much love from him as they did. However, compared to them, she was more fortunate in the sense that she had a child with him after all.\n The people of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the Peerless Sect, and the Heavenly Snow Mountain stood there in silence. Even if they did despise the Peerless Sect Leader, Zhou Weiqing, at the start, they had already truly acknowledged him after he had killed Fen Tian and jumped into the abyss without hesitation in pursuit of that cause.\n At this moment, Xue AoTian had the most complicated look on his face. That was because the people who entered the abyss were his son-in-law, as well as his only daughter!\n The moment Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had left for the abyss, he had been keeping both eyes closed without stopping them. Apart from his daughter and son-in-law, his wife was also within the abyss as well.\n The Heavenly Snow Mountain had already been destroyed; if his wife and daughter were to leave this world forever, even if the seal was completed, Xue AoTian would collapse out of devastation. This man, who used to be the world’s number one powerhouse, seemed old and weak at this very moment; he stood there quietly, and he was giving off an air of melancholy.\n However, within every single person’s heart, including Xue AoTian, Shangguan Tianyang, Zhou Weiqing’s wives, as well as all the other powerhouses - they were praying.\n It was unknown if whether it was due to the prayers of the powerhouses of all three Saint Lands, everything within the seal of the Netherworld was developing in a positive direction.\n The white incandescent light continued to clash against the pitch-black light. However, the incandescent light gradually managed to suppress the black light.\n This was not because Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy was more powerful than the original Destructive Energy. More importantly, it was due to the seal’s formation.\n At this moment, the circles of black halo released by the original Destructive Energy had gradually disappeared, and the Saint Energy vortex created by Zhou Weiqing and the twelve Divine Beasts had completely merged with the formation below. The red light emitting from the formation had also vanished - the light in the surroundings had already turned into a shade of whitish gold.\n Within the dense whitish golden light, there seemed to be countless starlight floating about, as though it had became the Milky Way. Every single time the starlight flickered, the entire formation would generate a powerful energy and strike the Lord of the Nether. The tears and marks from all the damage gradually disappeared at a speed that was distinguishable by the naked eye.\n As he was being restrained by the pressure created by the formation, the original Destructive Energy emitted by the Lord of the Nether became weaker and weaker. There was a possibility that it might vanish at any moment.\n As predicted by the Sidhe Empress and the Dragon Emperor, Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy was very effective when used on the seal’s formation.\n A deep roar was constantly heard coming from the small crack on the formation that was caused by the pincers - it was the Lord of the Nether’s voice that was filled with unwillingness to admit defeat.\n Zhou Weiqing had a grave and stern look on his face, just like before. Even though he had the upper hand, he was not complacent at all. He was absolutely not going to take it easy and relax until he had fully completed the seal.\n Puff——\n The incandescent Saint Energy finally had a head-on collision with the black original Destructive Energy. The entire formation shook violently and a massive amount of energy ripples abruptly surged. Zhou Weiqing, who was at the core of the formation, quivered together with the enormous pincers.\n A sorrowful sound was heard once again and they had began directly draining each other’s energy. Zhou Weiqing’s eyes glowed on and off; his massive will gathered all the Saint Energy and merged with the incandescent light erupted from his Saint God Core Nucleus. Within a blink of an eye, not only did the incandescent light expand, it had also become more concentrated. It was as though the Saint Energy became a solid spear, piercing hard into the black original Destructive Energy.\n At this time, a brilliant light erupted from the entire formation; the surrounding space shook violently. The segmented space phenomenon appeared, which occurred when they first got there, once again.\n The individual space pertaining to the seal appeared once again, except that there wasn’t any black light at all - just flickering endless whitish golden light. The sky of this parallel space was completely covered by the Milky Way. Streaks of starlight continuously shone from above, reflecting onto the incandescent Saint Energy spear that was slowly but steadily piercing downwards.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-305-2","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
