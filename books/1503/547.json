{"id":51721,"no":547,"title":"Chapter 183 Oops! (3)","content":"Chapter 183 Oops! (3) As the Battalion Commander, Zhou Weiqing’s large tent was one of the first few to be completed. Tian’er was right by his side, and as she her that voice, she giggled and said: “Someone is breaking a whole jar of vinegar [1. Being jealous]. Little Fatty, that shouldn’t be Shangguan Bing’er right, you can do it!” With an embarrassed look in his face, he bowed humbly to Tian’er and said: “I’ll go have a look first.” With a quick lift of the tent flap, he disappeared. Shangguan Fei’er was standing not far from the tent, and seeing Zhou Weiqing walk out, she looked at him icily. A cold killing intent caused goosebumps to appear all about Zhou Weiqing’s skin. “Fei’er, listen to my explanation… I’ve mentioned this to you before…” Zhou Weiqing walked over with an apologetic smile on his face. Shangguan Fei’er gave a cold humph and said: “Enough nonsense, come with me.” As she said that, she flew off in the air towards the outskirts of the camp. Zhou Weiqing dared not delay, and in a flash he had chased off after her. He had to explain things clearly now! Of course, whether or not he would succeed was another matter. Shangguan Fei\u0027er was moving very quickly in the front, every time her feet touched the ground, she would move almost ten yards ahead. Without using the Demonic Change State or Dragon Tiger Transformation, it took quite some effort for Zhou Weiqing to actually follow her. Within the time for a few breaths, the two had already left the camp. In Zhou Weiqing\u0027s eyes, Shangguan Fei\u0027er did not want to argue with him in front of everyone, leaving him face. Such a thought also calmed him down, since Fei\u0027er was willing to look after his face, that meant she wasn\u0027t fully angry. What should I do then? As Zhou Weiqing followed behind Shangguan Fei\u0027er, his eyes rolled in their sockets in deep thought. He was indeed filled with guilt. Fei\u0027er had stayed here to help me take care of everything and even fight for him, yet he had ran off for Tian\u0027er. This was indeed nothing to be proud of. Yet, at the same time, how could he not go find Tian\u0027er at that time? It was also impossible! There was no good reason for it all, and when he is in the wrong, there was no point trying to reason or persuade Shangguan Fei\u0027er... then the only option was to be shameless! Thinking up to that point, Zhou Weiqing had already come up with a plan. With a sudden purple flash in his eyes, he had silently entered the Dragon-Tiger Transformation. The wings behind his back unfurled as new strength filled him. With a silent beat, his entire body flew like an arrow towards Shangguan Fei\u0027er. By this time, both of them had already left the Peerless Battalion camp for quite a distance, and the area was rather wide and desolate. Just as Zhou Weiqing made his move, Shangguan Fei\u0027er had also thought this was a good enough place and had slowed down and started to turn around. As soon as she turned around, a purple face abruptly appeared right in front of her. No matter how strong she was, Shangguan Fei\u0027er was still a young lady, and being startled like that by such a strange looking purple face, she was given a fright and she yelled out loud. Right at that moment, the owner of the purple face gave her a kiss right on her lips, arms tightening around her waist as a pair of huge wings encircled and covered them both. His arms were so strong, and lips invading with such fiery heat. Shangguan Fei\u0027er only felt as if her head was dizzy before she had been pushed down to the ground by the muscular body, now atop of her. “Wuuu, no!” An indistinct cry came from Shangguan Fei\u0027er as she struggled with all her might. However, under the onslaught of those fiery lips, her body was feeling soft and unable to use her full strength. Especially with those powerful arms that held her, one hand was on the Acupuncture Point on her back, also causing her to be unable to use her full strength. Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to hold Shangguan Fei\u0027er in place first, otherwise with her anger and her terrifying close combat power, he knew he would not be able to take her on easily. Under the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, Zhou Weiqing was light, speedy and with massive strength. Since he had purposely snuck up upon her, Shangguan Fei\u0027er had not noticed until now, and it was already too late to struggle! How to be shameless? Of course, it was to make the waters murky before any discussion. Both he and Shangguan Fei\u0027er also loved each other, though they had been intimate with each other, they had not crossed that final line. In that previous instant, Zhou Weiqing had decided that actions were far stronger than words, let\u0027s be intimate first, then even if Fei\u0027er blamed him, she wouldn\u0027t beat him too hard right? Heh heh. According to Zhou Weiqing\u0027s original plan, he wanted to be intimate with Shangguan Fei\u0027er for a while, to make her happy and calmer before he slowly explained things. However, when he kissed those cool delicious lips of Shangguan Fei\u0027er, he could not control himself. Those lips were like the best miracle drug in the world, so comfortable, so comfortable. Especially now that it seemed that Shangguan Fei\u0027er\u0027s kisses had become more awkward. Zhou Weiqing had finally gone passed her teeth to find that smooth litle tongue of hers. One hand of his was still suppressed on the Acupuncture Point of her back to prevent her from running, while the other was moving along the smooth curve of her back. The fire in his blood rose, and a strong animal lust caused his breathing to deepen. If one had to point out a disadvantage of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, this would be it. No matter the Dark Demon God Tiger or Dragons, both were lustful beasts by nature. With the two bloodlines combined, that made things even worse, and in terms of basic ‘physical needs’, Zhou Weiqing now far surpassed any ordinary humans. Traveling all this way with Tian\u0027er, even with her powerful physique she had almost been unable to keep up. Currently, Shangguan Fei\u0027er was feeling extremely hot. That Zhou Weiqing pressing down atop her was like a large furnace, trying to melt down her entire body, and her defenses were slowly being eroded bit by bit from this intense heat. Zhou Weiqing\u0027s kiss had moved to her neck, and he was still murmuring: “Fei\u0027er, I love you.” Hearing those words, Shangguan Fei\u0027er\u0027s body shuddered silently, her dazed eyes suddenly regaining consciousness. Once again, she cried out: “Let go, let me go now.” “No, I won\u0027t let go of you anymore, what if you run off?” Zhou Weiqing gave a helpless chuckle, \u0027helping himself\u0027 to one of the bountiful mounds in her front, caressing it gently. “Let go of me!” Shangguan Fei\u0027er\u0027s voice was trembling and tears started falling from her eyes. Zhou Weiqing saw her tears and his lust instantly diminished greatly as he stared, startled. He had not imagined that Shangguan Fei\u0027er would have such a huge reaction. Quickly he kissed the tears on her cheeks and said: “Fei\u0027er, don\u0027t cry. It is my fault, it is all my fault. I have spread my love too much, but I truly cannot live without each and every one of you. If I had not gone to bring Tian\u0027er back, she would already be dead now. I cannot fail her, nor can I fail you. Can you understand my heart? I know I am being too greedy, but... that is me, a greedy soul. I want to hold you all tight, never let go.” “You... you bastard…” Shangguan Fei\u0027er said with a trembling voice. Seeing her angry and trembling lips, Zhou Weiqing was filled with love. Once again, he capture her lips. Bastard it shall be. In that instant, Zhou Weiqing decided to \u0027cook the rice first\u0027. That way, Fei\u0027er could not run away! As soon as that thought entered his mind, Zhou Weiqing\u0027s actions became even more excited. This time, he would not let go of her lips so easily. Take advantage now, and even if he got beaten up later it would already be a win! Furthermore, would Fei\u0027er bear to beat him up later? Shangguan Fei\u0027er\u0027s clothes lessened one after the other, and the flustered look in her eyes grew stronger. However, Zhou Weiqing\u0027s hand on her back kept control over her, not allowing her powerful Heavenly Energy to blow up. After all, previously she had not have any precautions against him. More so, Shangguan Fei\u0027er was unable to control her body. Under Zhou Weiqing\u0027s invasive and experienced teasing, even her soul was trembling as her heart\u0027s defenses fell. No, no no! Shangguan Fei\u0027er was regretting her actions now, regretting that she had not spoken clearly when she had the chance just now. However, it seemed that it was all too late now... Tears started pouring from her eyes, as her gaze was complicated. Anger, sorrow, pain... and despair. Zhou Weiqing had originally been fully immersed in his enjoyment, his hand already in Shangguan Fei\u0027er\u0027s long pants, holding her round and perky buttocks, almost about to pull her pants down. All of a sudden, the wet tears touched his face, and he subconsciously opened his eyes, his gaze meeting hers. Despair. Abruptly, Zhou Weiqing saw that strong despair in Shangguan Fei\u0027er\u0027s eyes. A cold chill ran down his spine. Although he had been wanting to make Fei\u0027er his own woman at this time before \u0027facing the music\u0027, now as he saw that despair in the depths of her eyes, his heart clenched in pain, and he forcefully pushed down the roaring fire of lust in his blood. Lifting his head subconsciously, his hands stopped totally. “Fei\u0027er, you…” Shangguan Fei\u0027er\u0027s tears streamed down even harder. “You... you bastard. I am not Fei\u0027er.” I am not Fei\u0027er. Those words, in Zhou Weiqing\u0027s ears, were like an explosion, blowing his mind into bits. Not Fei\u0027er? Then.. who? It couldn\u0027t be Bing\u0027er... with Bing\u0027er\u0027s character, especially since she had already known of Tian\u0027er and him long ago, how could she have such a look of despair? If it wasn\u0027t Bing\u0027er or Fei\u0027er... then it could only be... She... She was... Zhou Weiqing\u0027s entire body flew back as if he had been electrocuted, staggering back almost a dozen yards as his eyes widened in shock, a certain ‘evil tent’ below still at full mast. “You... you... you\u0027re Shangguan Xue\u0027er?!” TN: Phew, not an easy chapter to TL indeed. Anyway, the original title of this was \u0027A Big Mistake\u0027, but I thought \u0027Oops!\u0027 seemed more apt.
