{"id":51880,"no":706,"title":"Chapter 239: Thousand Year Golden Pearl (2)","content":"Although the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had many precious treasures, Shangguan Bing’er had after all grown up in the Heavenly Bow Empire, and had never been part of Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Even now, she still considered herself a part of the Heavenly Bow Empire. Despite her gentle appearance, Shangguan Bing’er was the most stubborn among the three Shangguan sisters. Once she set her mind on something, there was no changing it. Just like her relationship with Zhou Weiqing. If Shangguan Tianyue insisted on getting in between them, she would definitely run off and elope with Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing held up one of the golden pearls, utterly fascinated. The pearl emitted such a gentle aura. It must have come from a clam that was at least a thousand years old! Such a large pearl didn’t need to be paired with any other adornments. Just placing it in one’s room would have a vitality consolidation effect.\\n\\n However, that wasn’t the reason why Zhou Weiqing was so interested in the pearl. He distinctly remembered Duan Tianlang telling him once that if he could find a thousand-year golden pearl he might have a chance to increase his ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Legendary Set and allow it to thoroughly catch up to the level of the Boundless Infinitum Set.\\n\\n Towards those blueprints of the ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Legendary Set that Zhou Weiqing already owned, it was no big deal at all for Duan Tianlang to create them. However, ever since he had met Zhou Weiqing he had been hard at work researching how to further improve the ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Set and surpass his predecessors. He had mentioned those golden pearls to Zhou Weiqing only because they were exceedingly rare; Zhou Weiqing had not even been able to purchase one in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Naturally, he didn’t expect to find one here.\\n\\n Well, it was a different continent, after all. Just because it was rare in Boundless Mainland didn’t mean it would be equally rare on XuanTian Continent. XuanTian Continent was not as vast as and had fewer resources than Boundless Mainland, but that actually resulted in its oceanic development being far superior to that of the Boundless Mainland. Clams containing golden pearls only existed in the deep ocean. Although they were still considered treasured objects in on XuanTian Continent, but they were not one of a kind here as they were on Boundless Mainland.\\n\\n Er Chun was good at paying attention to the words and mannerisms of others. One look at Zhou Weiqing’s reactions and he knew this young God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master was pleased with his gift. In his heart, he was delighted by the result, hastily saying: “I’ve built up a humble collection of the last few years. If the Young Master would like, I can present you with something else later on.”\\n\\n Belongings were important, but for a Heavenly Jewel Master what could be more precious than a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll? Furthermore, Er Chun had his own views. With Zhou Weiqing’s status as a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, all he had to do was to join the XuanTian Palace and he’d certainly obtain an incredibly high position. More importantly, he was still so young. Within the next hundred years, it was likely that his position within the XuanTian Palace would not waver. If he could play up to such a high ‘branch’, why would he care about the current items in his collection? He’d be able to find ten times, even a hundred times more if he succeeded!\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing carefully placed the golden pearl back into its aloeswood box and handed it to Shangguan Bing’er. “An outstanding treasure. Er Chun, you have a good sense. I will overlook what happened today. However, you must restrain yourself. Understood?”\\n\\n Er Chun was delighted. Running into a person with a passionate sense of justice was what he feared most. He’d really be done for then. Since Zhou Weiqing accepted his gift so easily, it clearly showed he was not that sort of person. Someone willing to accept gifts was much easier to deal with.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er hugged the aloeswood box close to her. She was ecstatic about the pair of golden pearls and looked down at the box. But she was forcing herself to restrain the laughter in her eyes. This Little Fatty was truly rotten. He was clearly still playing the role of a greedy official. No. Greedy God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master was more like it. Still, she would never go against it. This was after all the XuanTian Continent and what they took off them was the belongings of the XuanTian Continent, so what of it? They might as well just take it.\\n\\n Just then, there was another knock at the door. Zhou Weiqing was puzzled. They had only just arrived in the W’Batu and did not know anyone else, who could be looking for them?\\n\\n “Enter,” Zhou Weiqing said passively. Er Chun also looked at the doorway curiously.\\n\\n An old man appeared at the door. As soon as he entered, he said with a wide smile on his face: “My dear Zhou Little Brother, you really had me fooled there!” It was none other than Grandmaster Guyu from The Pearl.\\n\\n Guyu’s clan wasn’t in W’Batu City, but was close by. Some members of his clan had actually participated in the XuanTian Trials today, and because Zhou Weiqing had gotten rid of those three dandys, a young disciple from his clan had been given another chance and had made it onto the participation list to the finals.\\n\\n Guyu had been deeply remorseful once he learned that Zhou Weiqing was a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, and he had hastened over to express his goodwill. He knew that he couldn’t be blamed for not thinking about such a possibility, after all that Zhou Weiqing was just too young. Alas, he couldn’t help but feel such regret… a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master had been released by him like that. If he had only known sooner he was a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, he would have roped him into joining his clan, even if he had to tie him up! With a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master amongst their ranks, perhaps in time they might actually have the chance to become another Saint Land! What depressed him most was the fact that he had been the one to write Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er’s letters of recommendation.\\n\\n That’s it! No wonder such a beauty as Shangguan Bing’er would fall for such an ordinary-looking person like Zhou Weiqing: he was a great talent, a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master!\\n\\n Of course, it was too late for regrets now. Since Zhou Weiqing had indicated he wished to join XuanTian Palace, Guyu didn’t have the guts to try to stop him. That would only bring a heap of trouble onto his clan. Either way, he still needed to come here. No matter what, he had to deepen the friendly relations with this young God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master whose life he had saved. It would be greatly beneficial to his entire clan.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled and stepped forward in a welcoming fashion when he saw it was Guyu. “So it’s Grandmaster Guyu. Don’t blame me for covering it up. After all, anything can happen on the open seas. I had to be careful. Don’t worry, Grandmaster, Weiqing will never forget how you saved my life.”\\n\\n An unsightly look flitted across Er Chun’s face momentarily when he saw it was Guyu. His cultivation wasn’t at Guyu’s level, but since he was from XuanTian Palace, he wasn’t really afraid of him.\\n\\n Only then did Guyu notice Er Chun was also in the room. He smiled faintly and said: “Brother Er Chun, you’re here too. You’re doing great things for XuanTian Palace this time!”\\n\\n These two were both crafty old foxes. Plus the crafty young fox, Zhou Weiqing was here too, so just a few simple words between them was already enough to make their meanings crystal clear. Zhou Weiqing had relieved Guyu’s heart, while the latter had expressed to Er Chun that he would not interfere with Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Er Chun smiled. “My dear Guyu, you just mentioned saving Young Master’s life. What’s the story there?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed. “I was out in the oceans with my humble wife hunting ocean beasts to obtain Heavenly Cores to make Consolidating Ink. Who knew that we would actually run into a Terror Sea Dragon and were nearly lost at sea. Fortunately, we encountered Grandmaster Guyu’s ship The Pearl and made it out alive. Isn’t that saving our life? In fact, if not for this experience, I might not have steeled my resolve to actually enter the public world and approach the XuanTian Palace. A person’s individual strength and resources are limited. If I want to continue researching how to make these Legendary Sets, I need a lot of financial backing. I figured that only XuanTian Palace could provide it.”\\n\\n “Legendary Sets?” Guyu and Er Chun exclaimed, nearly in unison. Shangguan Bing’er noticed them both gulp.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled. “I’ve only recently joined the ranks of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters. It’s just that the materials needed to make Consolidating Ink are far too rare. That’s not good for my cultivation.”\\n\\n Er Chun recovered himself and quickly put in, “Master, don’t you worry, in the entire XuanTian Continent, our XuanTian Palace can definitely supply your needs, and with the best service. A respected God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master such as yourself will not encounter any restrictions.”\\n\\n Guyu sighed inwardly. It was too late to say anything now. Luckily, Zhou Weiqing still remembered how he had saved his life. He thought about it and repressed the urge to beg for the desired Legendary Set. There was plenty of time for that later. If he got over-eager and asked now, Zhou Weiqing might not be able to do it even if he was willing, because he had just become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. He would wait until Zhou Weiqing was settled into XuanTian Palace first. In any case, with the favorable relations they had, whatever he asked for in the future would be like a repayment.\\n\\n Neither of them wanted to be first to leave so they dawdled for a while with some small talk. They only took their leave when Zhou Weiqing said he had to cultivate. Er Chun set an appointment with him to leave tomorrow, where he would personally escort them to XuanTian Palace headquarters in the Heavenly City, and participate in the annual XuanTian Trials finals.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing didn’t know what method of communication XuanTian Palace used, but it seemed to be very speedy. Early the next morning when Er Chun met them he told him that XuanTian Palace had already replied and said that he must see to Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er’s safety. They also sent instructions to Lord of W’Batu City, Sang Tan, to suppress word that a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master had appeared. He had to keep it a secret.\\n\\n A lavish horse carriage was prepared for them. It was wide and spacious, pulled by eight fine steeds. It had been sent specially for Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er. Including Er Chun, a total of eight XuanTian Palace members followed them. You could say W’Batu City’s XuanTian Palace had sent its best and brightest.\\n\\n After squaring things away with Zhou Weiqing the night before, Er Chun was more careful about his safety. Whether or not he would benefit by being with Zhou Weiqing, just by safely escorting a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master to the XuanTian Palace headquarters would already be a great achievement for him.\\n\\n The carriage was extremely roomy, so much so that there would be no problem carrying ten people. The interior was upholstered in leather and was carpeted with soft animal pelts. There was a large bed in an inner compartment, a chair and table outside that. The table was stocked with food. This carriage was better than that one he had been in with Hua Feng from the Heavenly Bow Unit.\\n\\n Climbing into the carriage, Zhou Weiqing chuckled to Shangguan Bing’er. “Er Chun knows how to enjoy himself, but it ends up benefiting us instead this time.”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-239-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
