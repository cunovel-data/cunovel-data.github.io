All of their gazes were fixed on Zhou Weiqing, awaiting his decision. \n Zhou Weiqing remained silent for five minutes before he finally lifted his head once more, a light glinting in his eyes as he gave the order: “Commander Ming Yu, if we are to start attacking now, how long will it take you to prepare?” \n Without hesitation, Ming Yu replied: “Everything is ready, and we can launch our attack at any time.” \n “Good.” Zhou Weiqing shouted. He stood up abruptly, the light in his eyes glowing brightly. In that instant, the entire meeting hall of officers could sense the powerful pressure from him. \n “Since that is the case, I will give you all one last day of preparations. Tomorrow night, we will launch our attack. As for the actual plan of action, we will discuss it now.” \n A light of admiration flashed through Ming Yu’s eyes. As they saying goes, indecision invariably leads to trouble. For Zhou Weiqing to make such a difficult decision in such a resolute fashion, especially in this short period of time, it was definitely an attribute that a good leader needed to have. \n Ming Yu got the majority of the officers to leave first, with only the core upper echelon members remaining here with Zhou Weiqing to discuss the detailed plans of the battle. \n Just like what Ming Yu had said earlier, in order to invade and reclaim the Heavenly Bow City, he had already prepared for several months. In terms of ability, they could already move out at any time, and they had even come up with plans for the various directions and modes of attacks. \n The core group discussed for four hours before they ended their meeting. \n Shangguan Bing’er was dragged away by Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er, leaving Zhou Weiqing to Tian’er. From Bing’er, they had already learned what happened to Zhou Weiqing. Furthermore, when they were departing for the Xuantian Continent, Tian’er had allowed Bing’er to accompany Zhou Weiqing alone, and they would wish to repay her kindness. After all, they would all be living together for the rest of their lives, and it was important to keep relationships cordial between them all. \n Tian’er held on Zhou Weiqing’s hand as they headed to her tent. She could still clearly sense the anger and sombre feelings within his heart. \n “Little Fatty, we can definitely do it.” As soon as the door was closed, Tian’er threw herself into Zhou Weiqing’s embrace, speaking gently. \n Zhou Weiqing held her gently, as if afraid to harm her. Stroking her long hair, he said: “I am fine. I, too, believe that we will definitely succeed. Tian’er promise me one thing alright?” \n However, Tian’er actually shook her head. “If you are trying to ask me not to join in the battle tomorrow, you do not need to speak it out. I will definitely be joining the fight. Otherwise, how could I face your parents in the future?” \n Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile as he said: “Tian’er, you are wrong. If my father knows that you are fighting together with me when pregnant, that will be the very thing he won’t forgive me for! Please listen to me babe, my precious Tian’er, do not join in this battle. With Master following me, how can you still be worried about me?” \n Tian’er pursed her lips in a pout, moving unwillingly in his embrace as she said: “No, I must go this time. Xue’er, Fei’er and Bing’er are all so outstanding, and they are also going with you to rescue your parents. If I do not go this time, how will they look at me. The first impression is always the most important, don’t you know? Dear husband, just let me go. Please, I beg you, even Father says I will be fine.” \n As soon as Tian’er called him ‘Dear Husband’ in such a sweet tone, it caused Zhou Weiqing to go half numb. If not for the fact that he was in such a solemn mood due to his family being in such danger, and the fact that they were so close to them… especially with the Heavenly King powerhouses of the Bai Da Empire threatening their lives at any moment, perhaps he might have ‘taken’ her there and then. \n “Tian’er, when you returned to the Heavenly Snow Mountain, what did father-in-law say?” Zhou Weiqing had not been able to accompany her to the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and he held Xue AoTian’s opinion in high regard. Everything else aside, Tian’er was bearing his child although they weren’t actually married yet, this was no small matter! After all, she was the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, Xue AoTian’s only daughter. However, from the fact that Xue AoTian had actually allowed her to come here, he should not be too angry. \n Hearing Zhou Weiqing mention her father, Tian’er stuck out her tongue and said: “Father was quite furious. I was almost unable to return here. That was really the first time I saw father’s expression change so much, being in such a rage yet having that helpless look on his face. Luckily, he was unable to endure my constant coaxing and pestering, so I managed to return. However, Father said that if you return to the continent and do not look for him, he will come to see you personally.” \n Zhou Weiqing’s face twitched slightly. He could totally imagine Xue AoTian gritting his teeth as he spoke those words. \n “This… dearest… you also know that I can’t leave at this moment. After I rescue my parents, I will definitely visit father-in-law to fix our date of marriage.” \n Tian’er said gently: “I know. You should complete these important matters first. Anyway, even if Father really comes, he won’t be able to really do anything to you. After all, we already have our child…” As she said that, she caressed her flat abdomen, with a radiant smile on her face. \n Zhou Weiqing quickly asked: “What did father-in-law say about our child? When will our precious be born?” \n Looking at the anxious look on Zhou Weiqing’s face, Tian’er giggled and said: “It is still too early; at least three more years. My memory was right previously, our Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline always takes a long time to give birth to our children. Furthermore, with the inheritance of our bloodlines and now, with the addition of the Saint Energy, Father says that our child’s defenses will be even stronger than us. My stomach cannot be injured so easily!” \n “Uhh… there is actually such a thing possible?” Zhou Weiqing stared at her in shock, jaw agape. \n Tian’er said proudly: “Of course, for our Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline to survive from ancient times up until now, we naturally have our various means and secrets. Whenever a female from the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline has a child, our bloodline will transform into a unique energy and fuse with the child, to protect him or her. Furthermore, I now have the Saint Energy. Father also said that with both our bloodline inheritance nurturing him, especially with the nourishment and protection of the Saint Energy, our child’s defense will be so strong that even his own attacks will not be effective. What else do you have to worry about? I will definitely join the fight tomorrow. Do not forget, I am the child’s mother, do you think I love him any less than you? Without Father’s assurances, I would never dare to ask for this.” \n Zhou Weiqing saw the stubborn resolution in Tian’er’s eyes and could only say helplessly: “Alright then, but without my permission, you are not to take action easily, okay?” \n “Okay!” Seeing that he had finally agreed, Tian’er instantly agreed happily. \n Zhou Weiqing continued: “Regarding the Nether Realm, what did father-in-law say?” \n The smile on Tian’er’s face instantly vanished as she said: “Father is also very worried about that matter. The reason why he wants to meet you, besides our own personal issues, is exactly because of this matter. He did not speak much about the Nether Realm, but he asked me to tell you that the real reason why my mother has always been unable to stay by my side is because she is one of the guards of the entrance to the Nether Realm. Even with my mother’s cultivation, she is not even a true guard, but a vassal to the true guardians.” \n Hearing Tian’er’s words, Zhou Weiqing’s expression instantly changed. He was extremely clear that the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia was a low Level Heavenly God Tier powerhouse. Even compared to the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian, she was only slightly inferior. However, even a powerful Heavenly God Tier powerhouse like her was just a vassal, then what kind of power did those true guardians of the Nether Realm have? Perhaps… it was even at the Max Level Heavenly God stage!\n With such a force of powerhouses as guardians, it indirectly proved the existence of the Nether Realm, and the sheer terrifying power in withheld. It looked like the misfortune of the dragon family was, like he had guessed, a conspiracy by the Nether Realm. Worse still, it looked like the Nether Realm had some connections with some of the powers in the Boundless Mainland. Of course, from the current situation, all signs pointed to the Blood Red Hell being the power in question. The destructive attribute energies they had displayed during the Heavenly Jewel Tournament was the greatest proof. Furthermore, the sudden explosive aggressiveness they now displayed also showed their ambitions. However, were things as simple as that? \n If it was just the Dan Dun Empire and the Bai Da Empire, with the support of the Blood Red Hell, and they were in the midst of some massive conspiracy, then would the ZhongTian Empire, Heaven’s Expanse Palace, WanShou Empire and Heavenly Snow Mountain just sit back and watch? Zhou Weiqing always believed that there was no such thing as ‘enemies forever’, only ‘mutual benefit forever’. \n Once the Blood Red Hell’s existence could threaten the survival of the rest of the Boundless Mainland, there was always the possibility of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain becoming allies!\n As such, the underlying truth should not be as simple as it seemed on the surface. A single Blood Red Hell would not dare to act out so boldly just like that. If the Nether Realm had connections to the entire Boundless Mainland, perhaps there would be more situations cropping up soon. All of the current issues was due to the Dan Dun Empire and the Blood Red Hell jumping out to reveal themselves, but this was just the beginning. \n It looked like no matter whether it was for Tian’er’s sake, or for the entire continent’s sake, he definitely had to make a trip to the Heavenly Snow Mountain. At least, the current war between the WanShou Empire and the ZhongTian Empire needed to be paused temporarily, to clarify everything first. \n Having thought through all that, Zhou Weiqing did not remain to accompany Tian’er much longer. He had just returned, and they were about to undergo a major military operation tomorrow; naturally he still had many things to deal with. \n …\n Throughout the rest of the day, Zhou Weiqing did not rest at all. Besides continuous meetings with the Heavenly Bow Empire upper echelons, he also joined Ming Yu to prepare for the major battle the next day. Of course, they also had to ensure that confidentiality was enforced and that their enemies would not gain information about the incoming attack.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-263-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
