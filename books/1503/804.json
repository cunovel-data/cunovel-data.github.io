(2)","content":"Duan Tianlang said, “When it comes to the eleventh piece of the Legendary Set, too many types of materials are needed to create the Consolidating Ink. It’s inevitable for some materials to clash. In order to amalgamate all the materials together without creating any clash or conflict, a special material is needed. Your Saint Energy is a good choice but it is after all external in nature, even if it is a success, it would still affect the quality of the Consolidating Ink and affect our process of creating the scroll as a result. Hence, we need an energy that is pure and internal to act as a mediating agent.”\\n\\n Duan Tianlang paused for a bit before continuing, “The attributes of the agent have to be strong, it has to completely dominate the other materials in order to succeed. Hence, you have to look for the fresh blood of the Sidhe Queen. You don’t need a lot of it, just three drops would suffice.\\n\\n “Sidhe Queen? What’s that?” Zhou Weiqing had never heard of her existence, but with the ‘queen’ as her title, she was definitely not a weak figure.\\n\\n Duan Tianlang smiled and said, “It’s not surprising that you don’t know who she is, only people like me who are a few hundred years old would have heard of her. The sidhe are an ancient race with a long history - they have been around even longer than us humans. During a certain period on the Mainland, the real rulers were the dragons, the sidhe, as well as a few species that are already fully extinct. On the other hand, we humans were only primates who could only serve as their slaves.”\\n\\n “As time went by, humans’ intellect as well as our ability to cultivate gradually developed, coupled with the fact that our ability to reproduce surpasses that of the other species, eventually making us the dominant species. The extinction of the other species was mostly due to humans. The sidhe and dragons were relatively on good terms with us, especially the dragons. Their reproductivity was simply too slow, hence, for a period of time, they did use us as spokesmen. However, the development of human beings was beyond the dragons’ expectations. Ultimately, the dragons lost control. Over the years, humans gradually came to control the entire Mainland, with the original rulers either extinct or in seclusion ever since. You’ve seen the giant dragons before. How many dragons are there on the Mainland? Very few, right?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said pensively, “That is to say, the sidhe are in the same situation as the dragons? They are also living in seclusion?”\\n\\n Duan Tianlang nodded his head and said, “It might be more appropriate to say that they’ve sealed themselves off from the world. Mother Nature loves the sidhe the most, when they combine themselves with nature, they can easily make use of all abilities that are nature based. They don’t have heavenly jewels like us, but they can manipulate the power of nature. In order to protect themselves from humans, twelve of their elders joined forces, sectioning and sealing off a part of the Mainland to create a world belonging to them, where they currently dwell. At that time, the humans made an agreement with the sidhe that they are not to leave the sealed grounds, and that humans are also not allowed to invade them.”\\n\\n “This was eons of years ago. Thereafter, indeed, the sidhe withdrew themselves from the spotlight in the history of Mainland and did not appear in front of the humans again. This is also the reason why you’ve never heard of them and are oblivious to their existence. However, the sidhe did not come to our world, but there are human beings who went to their world before. After recuperating for so many years, the sidhe had become a lot stronger than they used to be. Nonetheless, time has also destroyed all their desires - they virtually never want to leave their sealed grounds and are considered amicable towards human beings. The humans that they acknowledge could even stand to benefit from them.”\\n\\n “The sidhe are the sons and daughters of Mother Nature, and within the blood of the Sidhe Queen contains the purest power of nature. With three drops of her blood, the last piece of the Consolidating Equipment Scroll would naturally be successful. The Consolidating Ink would also reach its full potential.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing scratched his head and said, “Senior Uncle, your task is pretty hard to complete! Do you happen to know their whereabouts? And also, the Sidhe Queen is after all a leader of the tribe, I’m afraid that it might not be easy to get her blood. You described the sidhe to be powerful, we might not be able to deal with them that easily.”\\n\\n Duan Tianlang laughed and said, “Other people might not be able to do it but you’re different. You had already created several miracles, I had already done everything I could for you, the rest is up to you. As for the whereabouts of the sidhe, it’s rather simple. You just have to ask your wives, they definitely know the answer. For so long, the sidhe were not disturbed by the human world. Naturally, they must have some sort of relations with the human world, and Heaven’s Expanse Palace has the best relations with them. Did you think that the last piece of the Boundless Infinitum Set did not require some sort of special ingredient? Even though they did not require the Sidhe Queen’s blood, they required something precious belonging to the sidhe.\\n\\n With Duan Tianlang’s suggestion, Zhou Weiqing understood the situation better. Heaven’s Expanse Palace had good relations with the sidhe. That is to say that getting the Sidhe Queen’s blood did not seem entirely impossible. Since Heaven’s Expanse Palace could establish good relations with the sidhe, why can’t the newly established Peerless Sect?\\n\\n The sidhe were an ancient race. If it’s possible to establish good relations with them, it might bring about huge benefits to Peerless Sect.\\n\\n Thinking of that, Zhou Weiqing nodded, “Alright, Senior Uncle, leave this task to me. However, you have to promise me that before I come back, you cannot hurt yourself any more. If something happens to you, I will seal up this design forever and will not try to create it till the end of time.”\\n\\n Duan Tianlang nodded his head smilingly and said, “Without seeing the completion of the eleventh piece of the \u0027Hate Ground no Handle’ Set, I can’t possibly bear to die. You can leave in peace. But you have to be very careful - if you can’t do it, don’t force it either. The sidhe may be much stronger than you think. Even though they’ve never appeared on Mainland, I can surmise that there are many strong figures within the sidhe.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing nodded his head smilingly. As for the strong figures in the sidhe, he was not too bothered by them. A person’s confidence increases alongside his capabilities. The current Zhou Weiqing was not the same as he used to be - he had already evolved to the Heavenly Emperor Stage and possessed the reddish gold Astral Saint Energy. He was truly unafraid of anyone else in this world. If it depended on power and capabilities to complete his mission, he was feeling rather confident.\\n\\n After leaving Duan Tianlang’s room, Zhou Weiqing had directly left the city. Based on his current cultivation base, he was no longer restricted by space and distance. His physical body was able to move where he wanted to with just a thought. He could travel thousands of miles straight.\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er continued to look up at Shangguan Bing’er who was cultivating in the sky - it had been going on for a few days but Shangguan Bing’er had been continuously absorbing the atmospheric energy. The aura she was emitting also became stronger and stronger.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-273-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
