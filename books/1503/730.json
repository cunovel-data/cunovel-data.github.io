Just as Zhou Weiqing was feeling rather puzzled, the Tenebrous energy around her suddenly retracted. When Zhou Weiqing saw her body, he couldn’t help but let out a startled cry: “Transformation?!”\\n\\n Yes. Dreamwake was now completely different from earlier. All of her clothes had vanished, and replacing them was a dense layer of black reptilian scales. The scales actually looked quite similar to her Legendary Set. The strangest thing was, her eyes had become a devilish, blood-red color. Zhou Weiqing felt as though he was staring into the eyes of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon once more.\\n\\n An enormous pair of wings had already spread out behind Dreamwake. Her entire body was filled with a sense of both beauty and power. She seemed to have become much taller, and her face was now covered with a mask that completely hid her features. All he could see was her devilish, blood-red eyes.\\n\\n One final arrow landed, and Dreamwake didn’t even move to dodge. Clank! The scales on her body were able to easily deflect the power of Zhou Weiqing’s arrow.\\n\\n “You bastard. There’s no way I’m going to spare you today.” Even Dreamwake’s voice seemed to have grown colder than before. She suddenly flashed forwards, moving twice as fast as she previously did as she instantly swooped over to Zhou Weiqing. Her two hands had already transformed into draconic claws as well, and they tore at his shoulders.\\n\\n The Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation was one of Dreamwake’s greatest secrets. Not even the Grand Elders had such a powerful ability as this. The Tenebrous Dragon Transformation doubled her speed and strength while quadrupling her defensive power. This was a supremely powerful transformation technique. Although she was currently unable to use any of her Stored Skills, this didn’t mean she was unable to use the power of her bloodline.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing was completely dumbfounded. He punched out with twin fists, seeking to block Dreamwake’s claws, but the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation gave her power that was beyond what he could possibly withstand. A loud explosion rang out, followed by Zhou Weiqing being knocked backwards as though he had been shot out of a cannon.\\n\\n Dreamwake’s wings flapped hard, allowing her to speed up once again as she launched a rainstorm of powerful attacks while chasing after Zhou Weiqing, causing him to let out a series of miserable howls. Thankfully, Dreamwake wasn’t actually trying to kill him and she was holding back slightly. Although she made Zhou Weiqing feel agony, it wasn’t enough to injure him too badly.\\n\\n “Are you seriously trying to kill me?!” Zhou Weiqing said angrily.\\n\\n “Who told you to be so shameless and lecherous! Yes, I’m going to kill you!” Dreamwake replied, her icy voice echoing nonstop while she continued to launch attacks without any slowdown at all.\\n\\n “Fine, then I’ll go all-out as well! Do you really think you are the only one with a transformation?!” A tremendously cold aura suddenly burst out from Zhou Weiqing’s body as well, and all of a sudden he once more launched twin punches against Dreamwake’s claws.\\n\\n A loud explosion rang out once more… and this time, it was Dreamwake who was sent flying backwards. Dreamwake felt as though an utterly enormous surge of power had just slammed into her, sending her backwards.\\n\\n How did he suddenly become so powerful? My seal should still be active. A heartbeat later, Dreamwake saw that Zhou Weiqing had changed as well.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s clothes had been torn to ribbons, and his body seemed to have actually swelled in size. A dazzling yet evil aura emanated from his body as the tiger tattoos began to pulse through his body as though they were alive. On his forehead, the symbol for ‘King’ appeared, emanating an aura of dominance. His eyes had become red, while a pair of enormous wings spread out behind his back. His entire body emanated a dense gray aura of energy. He slowly lifted up his right leg, which had actually transformed into the shape of a hook.\\n\\n What’s this? He can transform as well? Dreamwake could vaguely make out the translucent image of a great tiger appearing behind Zhou Weiqing’s back.\\n\\n The Demonic Change State! That’s right. Zhou Weiqing used the Demonic Change State, not the Dragon-Tiger Transformation.\\n\\n When he saw her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation, he was able to tell that within her veins flowed the blood of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Bloodline. He himself, however, definitely was not going to casually reveal his own draconic lineage, because his lineage stemmed from the Dragon Emperor Bloodline of Hui Yao. The Dragon Emperor Bloodline didn’t belong to this continent; it belonged to the Boundless Mainland. The Tenebrous Demon Dragon had mentioned this before. If he displayed the Dragon Emperor Bloodline, wouldn’t that be the same as telling everything that he wasn’t from the Xuantian Continent? And so, his only choice was to use the Demonic Change State.\\n\\n Thanks to the power of his Saint Energy, it wasn’t too hard for Zhou Weiqing to separate his transformation to use the Demonic Change State once more. This transformation focused on providing him with strength, allowing him to increase his power fourfold. His defenses would also be enhanced, but it wouldn’t be by as much as the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation provided. But of course, his Ice Cold Perception wasn’t something the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation could provide.\\n\\n On the whole, it looked as though the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation was slightly stronger than the Demonic Change State… but even so, its appearance gave Dreamwake quite the shock. The way in which she looked at Zhou Weiqing instantly changed as well.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing made Dreamwake feel as though she was staring at an enormous treasury. There was an endless number of secrets she could ‘excavate’ from him, and those treasures all whispered of tremendous power or genius talent.\\n\\n “What transformation is this?” Dreamwake stared at Zhou Weiqing, puzzled.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing chuckled. “Have you forgotten that I possess the Demonic Attribute? This is a first-generation Demonic Attribute at that. This transformation is naturally the Demonic Change State, a Controllable Demonic Change State. Ever heard of it? Do you perhaps feel tremendous awe towards me now?”\\n\\n Dreamwake smirked, but she had to admit that Zhou Weiqing had stunned her immensely. “Do you really think your Demonic Change State can withstand my Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation?”\\n\\n Neither side hesitated. At exactly the same moment, pillars of dark-golden light shot out into the air. Apparently, their various seals had been exhausted at the same time, and so they didn’t hesitate at all in releasing their Consolidated Equipment.\\n\\n Both were dressed in dark-gold Legendary Sets and had used their respective transformations. As far as Dreamwake could tell, both had unleashed the maximum amount of power they had access to. As soon as they donned their Consolidated Equipment, they simultaneously shot out at tremendous speed to charge at each other. They didn’t didn’t choose to use any techniques and instead chose to simply clash against each other in a furious head-long collision, neither having the advantage over the other.\\n\\n “Zhou Weiqing, you are very strong. A bit stronger than I had imagined.” Dreamwake panted slightly as she stared intently at Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Both had used up an enormous amount of Heavenly Energy. Even though Dreamwake had a nearly inexhaustible supply of energy, Zhou Weiqing had unleashed one strange attack after another. After he had used the Demonic Change State, his power had increased fourfold… and that was after his equipment strengthened him by sixty-four times! Although she was able to rely on her innate flexibility and agility to dodge, his attacks were still tremendously dangerous to her. And so, in their latest clash she had used up far, far more Heavenly Energy than Zhou Weiqing had.\\n\\n His strength was simply incredible. She only had access to the six-Jeweled cultivation stage, while she had to deal with the strength of a Heavenly King. How was she supposed to fight him? The only way she could win was if Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was depleted.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing chortled. “I could say the same about you! You are limiting the strength of your Heavenly Energy, after all. Dreamwake, why don’t we just call it a day and count this as a draw? We’ll just treat it as a sparring match.”\\n\\n Dreamwake let out a cold snort. “In your dreams. Do you think you won?” As she spoke, she slowly lifted her draconic claws up high, then sent an awesome burst of Heavenly Energy out from her body. It remained at the six-Jeweled level, but for some reason it seemed to be a bit different.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing could vaguely sense that her body seemed to have grown a bit larger… or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the Legendary Set she wore had actually fused together with her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation.\\n\\n What type of ability is this? Zhou Weiqing stared, wide-eyed. He had never before seen anyone who had the power to fuse their transformations with their Consolidated Equipment.\\n\\n Dreamwake stared at him coldly. “This is the second form of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form. Feel proud. I won’t lose. Now that I’ve used the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form, all my attributes and powers have been doubled. In this state, even if I merely use the six-Jeweled cultivation level, I can hold off even a Heavenly King powerhouse for a time. You might be very strong, but you are still nothing before my Tenebruous Demon Dragon’s True Form. The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form grants me the power of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon for a brief time. Of course, I’ll merely be a six-Jeweled Tenebrous Demon Dragon… but that will be more than enough to deal with you.”\\n\\n As she spoke, she quickly transformed to unleash a dense miasma of darkness energy from her body. She had actually transformed into an enormous dragon, except in a miniaturized form.\\n\\n If he hadn’t seen this with his very own eyes, he would never have believed this. Although he also had a second form of his Dragon-Tiger Transformation, ‘Like Dragon Equivalent Tiger’, it only transformed a part of his body. There was no way it could result in something like Dreamwake had just done, transforming into an actual dragon!\\n\\n Xuantian Palace had just become an even more mysterious place in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes. How many marvelous techniques did this mighty Saint Land possess?\\n\\n He couldn’t wait any longer. Zhou Weiqing didn’t want to wait, and he didn’t want to let his opponent maul and dominate him. Dreamwake probably hadn’t called him out simply to test him; there had to be another reason behind it. If he lost, not only would she look down upon him, he’d probably suffer a severe injury.\\n\\n Red light flashed through his eyes. Before Dreamwake had fully completed her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation, Zhou Weiqing made his move. He instantly pounced towards her.\\n\\n Dreamwake stared at him, a disdainful look in her eyes. She snorted, “It’s useless. While I am transforming into the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form, I’m in a completely invulnerable state. The only way to break it is if your cultivation level surpasses that of my original level, which means you have to at least be a Heavenly Emperor. Otherwise, there’s no way you can stop my, my… hey, w-what are you doing?!”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-247-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
