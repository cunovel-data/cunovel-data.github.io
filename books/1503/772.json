(2)","content":"Six streaks of dazzling light formed around him, transforming into an enormous globe which smashed straight at Zhou Weiqing.\n Zhou Weiqing had already been put on the defensive. Now, he could do nothing but passively defend against Long Shiya’s overwhelming power. Long Shiya was also a Heavenly Emperor, but he gave Zhou Weiqing a far greater amount of pressure than Shangguan Tianyue had. It must be remembered that he had been given the title of the number one expert below the Heavenly God level!\n Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to block with his two hands in front of his chest. Instantly, his palms transformed to become completely gray. A round gray vortex quietly formed in front of him. Once Long Shiya’s six-colored globe of light collided against that gray vortex, it was instantly melted down to a third of its original size, then collided against Zhou Weiqing’s palms.\n Anyone else aside from Long Shiya, including other Heavenly Emperors, who didn’t use Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills would’ve seen their attacks completely melted away by Zhou Weiqing’s Devour Skill. Long Shiya, however, was different. He had six different types of Heavenly Energy. Although the Devour Skill could still dissolve his attack, it wasn’t able to dissolve all of it.\n A boom rang out, followed by the light around Zhou Weiqing’s body growing markedly stronger as he staggered ten steps back before just barely able to find his footing.\n “Master, what are you doing!?” Only now did Zhou Weiqing finally manage to speak.\n Long Shiya was briefly startled when he saw that gray vortex appear between Zhou Weiqing’s hands. He didn’t press the attack, but his face was still quite ugly to behold. “Speak! Who are you, that you dare to pretend to be my disciple?”\n Zhou Weiqing had a helpless look on his face. “I’m your darling disciple, Little Fatty! Why would anyone pretend to be me?”\n Long Shiya said angrily, “Bullshit! Even if that brat Weiqing managed to increase his cultivation, he wouldn’t have been able to become a Heavenly King after just one year. Who do you think you are fooling? I’m going to rip that human-skin mask off your face!”\n Long Shiya had originally come because he had sensed the energy ripples of a Heavenly King. He was worried that the Peerless soldiers wouldn’t be able to handle it, which was why he came. And yet, as soon as he arrived he saw Zhou Weiqing. He had been so delighted that he forgot all about the reason why he had come.\n But… as soon as he had swatted Zhou Weiqing, he felt that something was wrong. Zhou Weiqing’s body actually unleashed a counter-force, and it seemed as though even the atmospheric energies in the air had wanted to impede his slap. This was something only a Heavenly King could do! How old was Zhou Weiqing? No matter what, Long Shiya wouldn’t believe that this brat had been able to reach this level in such a short period of time. In addition, he actually wasn’t able to see through Zhou Weiqing’s aura of energy. This was why his face had suddenly changed and why he wanted to capture this ‘imitator’.\n However, Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic Attribute and his Devour Skill had confused Long Shiya even further. Although this Devour Skill was far more powerful than it had been in the past, it was still fundamentally the same thing. Long Shiya had never seen anyone save for his darling disciple who was capable to use this technique, the Devour Skill. This was why he had paused his attacks.\n Zhou Weiqing stared at Long Shiya. He didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry. “Master, you are being unreasonable! Others all hope for their disciples to grow stronger. Why do you hope for me to be weak?! Other things can be faked, but this can’t be, right? This is something which only I have.”\n As he spoke, he drew his hands in a circle before him, forming two triangles which intersected and unleashed the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation.\n When Long Shiya saw the six dazzling streaks of light appear below Zhou Weiqing’s feet, Long Shiya’s ashen face instantly froze. Zhou Weiqing was right. Other techniques could be feigned, but the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation definitely could not!\n Zhou Weiqing’s Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was based on Long Shiya’s own Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation. This supreme technique required one to have six Attributes, and only Long Shiya and his disciple knew the method for training it.\n Even if someone could imitate Zhou Weiqing’s appearance, his Attributes couldn’t be mimicked. Zhou Weiqing’s six combination specific Attributes were unique to him. Combined with the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, it was enough to prove who he was.\n “Are you really Little Fatty?” Long Shiya asked, puzzled.\n Zhou Weiqing’s face twitched. “Master Big Fatty, I’m none other than your Little Fatty! It’s true that I’ve grown more powerful. You should at least give me the chance to tell you what’s happened!”:\n Long Shiya’s eyes flickered. “Wait a second. Tell me. When you fused the Dragon-Tiger Bloodline at the mouth of the volcano, who ended up being the sacrifice?”\n Zhou Weiqing was instantly speechless. He glanced sideways at Shangguan Bing’er, then said helplessly, “It was Little Witch, Wu Yuehan. You told me to be responsible for her afterwards.”\n Upon hearing this, Long Shiya was truly stunned. The thick murderous aura surrounding him dissipated. He stepped forward, staring at Zhou Weiqing with a look of disbelief.\n “You brat. You absolute brat! You actually became a Heavenly King? Goddamn the heavens, that’s so completely unfair! When I became a Heavenly King, I was in my fifties. How old are you?!”\n Zhou Weiqing laughed bitterly. “Since when is a master jealous of his own disciple? Master, you are in the wrong here.”\n Long Shiya startled to chortle, his laughter causing the meat on his face to bunch up around his eyes, making them nearly invisible. “Come here.”\n Zhou Weiqing snorted. “I refuse. What if you hit me again?”\n Long Shiya cursed with a laugh, “Get the hell over here, brat! If I want to hit you, I will. I’m your teacher! Can’t a teacher discipline his disciple?”\n Zhou Weiqing helplessly walked back to Long Shiya, who glanced at him and then started to laugh again. “Very nice. As the saying goes, a heroic father will produce a manly son. You are indeed my disciple! Let’s see how that old bastard Xue Aotian is going to brag to me in the future. My disciple not only took away his daughter but also became a Heavenly King! Haha! Ahahahahah!”\n When Zhou Weiqing saw his teacher roar with laughter in an absolutely shameless manner, he couldn’t help but feel awkward. What the hell! He had finally met his master again, but the first thing his master did was to suddenly attack him. Thankfully, he had just barely managed to defend. Otherwise, those two hits from his master would’ve been quite painful.\n Zhou Weiqing wasn’t the only one to feel awkward. All of the Peerless soldiers felt their hearts twitching as they stared at this, especially Kou Rui. However, Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya joking around wasn’t that shocking. Long Shiya, however, had just stated that Zhou Weiqing was actually a Heavenly King! Boss is actually a Heavenly King!\n In the entire Heavenly Bow Army, only Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang were at or above the Heavenly King level. Technically, however, they didn’t really ‘belong’ to the Heavenly Bow Army; they were honored guests and allies. The greatest weakness of the Heavenly Bow Empire was that it didn’t have enough powerhouses of its own, especially at the highest level. Now that Zhou Weiqing had become a Heavenly King, things were completely different. The Heavenly Bow Empire finally had a Heavenly King of its own!\n “Let’s go back to the base first. I need to show off in front of old Duan, haha! The best decision I made in my entire life was to accept you as my disciple.”\n The Six Ultimates Emperor had always acted as he pleased. He was never one to hide his feelings. If he was happy, he was happy. Frankly speaking, the smug look on his face made even the Peerless soldiers feel that this Big Fatty needed a beating. But of course, no one dared to say anything.\n After these affairs, everyone returned to their respective camps. The first thing Kou Rui’s did was to report to the high level members of the Heavenly Bow Empire, while Long Shiya led Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er to go meet Duan Tianlang.\n “Oho! Weiqing, you rascal. You returned.” Duan Tianlang was extremely surprised and happy when he saw Zhou Weiqing. Zhou Weiqing wanted to bow to him, but he was stopped.\n “I’m just glad you are back. The Heavenly Bow Empire really can’t be without you, its spiritual leader. The most important battle in the revival of the Heavenly Bow Empire is about to begin. You came back right in the nick of time. Uncle-Master has already completed the things you need.” While speaking, Duan Tianlang waved his hand. Three boxes appeared on the desk. Without question, they held God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls.\n “Thank you, Uncle-Master. You must have exhausted yourself,” Zhou Weiqing said sincerely. The respect he felt towards Duan Tianlang was every bit as great as the respect he felt for his master. For the sake of the Legacy of Strength, Duan Tianlang had paid an enormous price. He had helped Zhou Weiqing out greatly in a completely selfless way.\n Long Shiya chortled off to the side, “Old man Duan, your Legendary Set isn’t good enough.”\n Duan Tianlang blinked. “Not good enough? Why isn’t it good enough? Weiqing is already at the nine-Jeweled level, right? When he left, he was at the six-Jeweled level. I have exactly three more pieces, one for each level!”\n Long Shiya lifted his hand up, then wagged a finger in an absolutely shameless manner. “Nine-Jeweled, nonsense! He’s the personal disciple of myself, the Six Ultimates Emperor. It’s been a full year. How could he still be at the nine-Jeweled stage? He’s at the ten-Jeweled stage!”\n When Shangguan Bing’er saw how Long Shiya was acting, she couldn’t help but let out a giggle. It must be remembered that just moments ago, Long Shiya had actually attacked Zhou Weiqing due to disbelieving that the latter could have possibly improved so quickly. Now, he was pretending it was all as he expected.\n Despite how arrogant Long Shiya was behaving, Duan Tianlang was indeed shocked. He stared dumbly at Zhou Weiqing. “Weiqing, you are a Heavenly King? Already?”\n Zhou Weiqing chuckled. “I was lucky.”\n Duan Tianlang’s facial expression became extremely odd. “You brat, you really are a talented freak! Thankfully, I didn’t waste this past year either. I wasn’t planning to give this to you right away, as I wanted you to work harder towards becoming a Heavenly King. Now, it seems, I can give it to you in advance.”\n As he spoke, he lifted up his right hand and produced two more wooden boxes on the table.\n This time, it was Long Shiya’s turn for his smile to freeze. “Old man Duan, you completed the Hate Ground No Handle Set?” It must be remembered that Zhou Weiqing already had five pieces of the Hate Ground No Handle Set. These five additional pieces meant that he now had a full ten-piece Hate Ground No Handle Set!\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-262-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
