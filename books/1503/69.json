When she saw Zhou Weiqing again, she was extremely surprised. “Little Wei, what happened to you?”\\n\\n At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was rolling around on the ground, his military uniform had been thorn a lot by the thorny undergrowth, revealing his arms as well as the shining titanium alloy internal armor.\\n\\n His breathing was ragged and heavy, and what made Xiao Ru Se’s heart tremble was the fact that both his eyes had turned bloodshot, and his whole body’s muscles had ballooned out, causing him to look as if he was a whole size bigger than before.\\n\\n “Elder Sis, I am feeling so uncomfortable.” Zhou Weiqing’s voice was so hoarse, sounding just like an old man, while his body was twitching unceasingly. The most unusual thing was that although he was lying down on the ground, but his right leg was actually raised up high and curled upwards, and you could clearly hear his bones of his right leg moving and grinding from within, as if a heavy hammer was smashing the bones open and reforging them.\\n\\n “Little Wei, what\u0027s going on?” Xiao Ru Se wanted to go forward and support him, but a strong force actually emitted from Zhou Weiqing’s body suddenly, causing her to back up several steps before falling down.\\n\\n With a ripping sound, Zhou Weiqing had torn off the clothes on his upper body due to the excessive pain, with only the internal armour remaining on his body tenaciously. On his granite-like, muscled body, the black tattoos were surging forth again just like tiger stripes, and on his forehead, a clear black ‘King’ word reappeared as well.\\n\\n At this moment, the entire Stars Forest seemed to have quietened; just a moment ago the forest had been extremely lively with insects crying and birds warbling, and they had all stopped suddenly. The silence in the forest was almost deafening, and made it seem rather eerie, with only Zhou Weiqing’s heavy breathing breaking the silence.\\n\\n If it were anyone else, perhaps they would have been afraid of Zhou Weiqing’s fierce appearance, but Xiao Ru Se was not. She grit her teeth tightly and threw herself forward a second time, grasping Zhou Weiqing’s head and shouting to him loudly: “Little Wei, calm down, you need to calm down. Focus your Heavenly Energy and use it to calm your internal breathing.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing was currently feeling his heart being filled with a cruel, tyrannical, ruinous aura, giving him the urge to tear everything around him into shreds, with both his hands contorted into a claw shape as his bones were cracking. His hands had also grown to double the usual size in this short amount of time, with sharp claws faintly protruding out. The black tiger striped tattoos on his body became more and more obvious, and it felt as if he had inexhaustible strength surging forth from his body unceasingly...\\n\\n His head being hugged by Xiao Ru Se, Zhou Weiqing subconsciously lifted his tiger claws and firmly grasped Xiao Ru Se by the shoulder, opening his mouth and was about to bite her on the neck.\\n\\n Xiao Ru Se being held by his tiger claws, felt her whole body go numb, and found that she was not able to move at all, and her mind also fell into a blank.\\n\\n Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to bite down, he suddenly stopped. Xiao Ru Se also awoke at that instance, and she could actually clearly feel his hot breath on her neck, making her skin crawl and shiver.\\n\\n “No, No I cannot. You are Ru Se Elder Sis.” Zhou Weiqing muttered in a hoarse voice as he breathed heavily, and he quickly loosened his grip on Xiao Ru Se and shoved her backward. However, his head was grasped by her again.\\n\\n “Little Wei, if it makes you feel better, you can go ahead and bite. Elder Sis is not afraid.” Xiao Ru Se extended her hand resolutely and placed it in front of Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s bloodshot eyes were filled with a cruel light, which seemed to become more intense. However, he managed to restrain himself and not bite down. In his heart, he had a very intense uneasy feeling, the feeling that if he took that bite, he would lose his Ru Se Elder Sis forever.\\n\\n That intense feeling made him able to suppress the strong negative feelings that had risen within him, though the cruel, tyrannical aura in his eyes did not diminish, but at least they did not continue increasing. Xiao Ru Se continued hugging his head, as he took in big gulps of air, panting hard for breath.\\n\\n “You… What are you two doing?” All of a sudden, a surprised voice resounded out of nowhere. In a flash of light, a person appeared right next to them. [1. #Busted!]\\n\\n It was Shangguan Bing’er who had just arrived.\\n\\n Earlier, when she had heard that Zhou Weiqing had been brought away by Xiao Se, she had not thought much about it. After all, Zhou Weiqing was a Heavenly Jewel Master, and how could Xiao Se be of a match to him? However, the Fresh Recruit Tournament had already ended, and yet both of them had not returned, and Shangguan Bing’er was feeling rather restless and uneasy in her heart. Although in her heart she claimed that she still abhorred and hated that Zhou Little Fatty for taking her first night, but she herself did not know that deep in her innermost feelings, Zhou Little Fatty had already inscribed his shadow there. This was a possible situation, when a girl had given her first time to someone, naturally she would form a profound impression of him, furthermore she had been spending every day with Zhou Weiqing for the last few months.\\n\\n She decided to go around and look for them to assuage her feeling of unease. Relying on her new Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment, the Wind Wielding Boots, she entered the Stars Forest at lightning speed, and just a moment ago, the roar that Zhou Weiqing had issued had drawn her to the scene.\\n\\n From a distance, she saw Xiao Se and Zhou Weiqing, but she had never expected to see the scene before her - Xiao Se was hugging Zhou Weiqing’s head unexpectedly, looking extermely intimate... In her understanding, Xiao Se was a man! A man hugging another man? This...\\n\\n As she got closer, only then did Shangguan Bing’er realise that something was very wrong. When she saw Zhou Weiqing’s fierce appearance with the tiger striped tattoos and the huge expanded muscles, and his terrifying bloodshot eyes, the trembling feeling in her heart spread over her entire body instantaneously. Was this not not just the circumstances that he was in when he took away her most precious thing a few months ago?\\n\\n Xiao Ru Se saw Shangguan Bing’er standing there stunned, and immediately cried out angrily: “Silly! What are you doing standing there like that? Help me to hold him down quickly! You are also a Heavenly Jewel Master, what\u0027s going on?”\\n\\n “I, I do not know…” Shangguan Bing’er squatted down in panic, although in the heart she was frightened of Zhou Weiqing’s present appearance, but she did not want to just walk away.\\n\\n As she squatted down, Shangguan Bing’er immediately saw how much pain Zhou Weiqing was in, how his whole body was wrecked in convulsion, and quickly called out: “Zhou Little Fatty, Zhou Little Fatty, calm down a little.”\\n\\n All this while, Zhou Weiqing had been semi conscious and not very aware of what was going on, but all of a sudden he heard a familiar sound, and an incomparably familiar smell, and his body stiffened, suddenly moving on its own accord; springing loose from Xiao Ru Se’s embrace, and with a low roar his two tiger claws had grasped onto Shangguan Bing’er’s shoulders.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er could have easily dodged it, especially since she had the Wind Wielding Boots. However, she chose not to do so, and in that instance, the thought in her mind was unexpectedly that if she died in his hands, that would be okay.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-3-chapter-18-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
