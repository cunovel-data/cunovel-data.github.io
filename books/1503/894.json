The Heavenly Energy of all twelve Divine Beasts came charging towards him from all directions; the most amazing thing was that under the influence of the seal’s formation, the massive Heavenly Energy did not hurt him in any way. On the contrary, the massive Heavenly Energy was extremely obedient - it was completely under his control.\n An extremely dazzling radiance burst out of the Saint God Core Nucleus on Zhou Weiqing’s chest. The originally whitish golden Saint Energy gradually released a strong white heat. Under Zhou Weiqing’s precise control, the massive Heavenly Energy that was coming from the outside transformed into his own Heavenly Energy at an alarming speed.\n A huge incorporeal vortex had formed around Zhou Weiqing, with him at its center. The massive energy within the vortex was formed from the immense Heavenly Energy of all the twelve Divine Beasts. The massive Heavenly Energy continuously rotated and every single rotation was a refining process. The energy would come into contact with Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy, before transforming into purer Saint Energy, which would then be used by Zhou Weiqing.\n Even though Zhou Weiqing was a Max Level Heavenly Emperor, his body was definitely unable to handle such massive amount of Saint Energy being channeled into his body - it would reach a point where it was almost bursting, as it belonged to the twelve Heavenly God Divine Beasts after all. However, this was not a problem for him due to the effects of the seal’s formation. After circling around Zhou Weiqing’s body, the purified massive Saint Energy was available for him to use, without the need for it to enter his body first. This was also the reason why Zhou Weiqing felt that the entire formation was his body.\n Under such circumstances, his body was under nearly zero pressure at all, yet at the same time, his cultivation base merged perfectly with that of the twelve Divine Beasts. It was indeed a very powerful existence!\n He could not afford to be preoccupied with the sadness caused by the death of the Dragon Emperor. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing had a strong conviction in completing the Dragon Emperor’s final wish, which was to thoroughly seal the Lord of the Nether.\n Earlier on, the Sidhe Empress’ attack happened at the perfect timing. Even though she paid a hefty price, she ultimately managed to stall enough time for Zhou Weiqing. Or else, if Zhou Weiqing had taken the fatal blow from the Destructive Energy, even if he was not severely injured, it would definitely mess up his control over the entire formation. He was not the Dragon Emperor - he was still not familiar with the seal’s formation. If a problem were to arise, it would most likely give the Lord of the Nether an opportunity to get away or sabotage. More often than not, a brief moment could determine victory or defeat.\n At this moment, the Lord of the Nether’s gloominess had reached the extreme end of the spectrum. Even though both the Sidhe Empress and the Ancient Tree of Life had paid a rather hefty price to block his attack, not only did they manage to neutralize his attack, they had significantly pushed his pincers, that had partially broken out of the seal, back to where they came from. If the Lord of the Nether had attacked with full force, he could definitely thoroughly destroy the Sidhe Empress or the Ancient Tree of Life. However, the most tragic thing for him was that he had not completely broken the seal. Hence, the majority of his power was still limited within the formation. It was impossible for him to make any full-force attacks. Or else, how would it have been possible for the Dragon Emperor or the Sidhe Empress to seal him?\n The crucial moment, that determined whether or not the Lord of the Nether could break the seal, had arrived. He had completely disregarded the fact that he was draining his energy and attacked without holding back.\n The pitch-black Destructive light transformed into circles of halos that soared upwards. At the same time, a pitch-black ball of light appeared once again between the two pincers.\n Circles of halos soared upwards and forcefully resisted against the Saint Energy vortex that belonged to Zhou Weiqing and the twelve Divine Beasts, preventing the the massive Saint Energy to enter the seal’s formation.\n Till this very moment, the Lord of the Nether was already using all his might and risking his life, He was very clear that under the circumstances that he was unable to execute full force attacks, the only thing that could destroy Zhou Weiqing was the original Destructive Energy.\n Zhou Weiqing snorted coldly. A bright incandescent light erupted from the Saint God Core Nucleus on his chest and transformed into an incandescent light that was as thick as a person’a arm, before descending from above. It struck the black light ball, that the Lord of the Nether had just condensed, hard.\n The time to counterattack had arrived!\n Puff——\n There were no violent explosion sounds. The two purest colors, black and white, collided hard. The black halo and the white vortex came into contact at the same time. The energy from both parties violently collided.\n At this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy revealed its powerful ability to suppress the Destructive Energy. If it were the Dragon Emperor who was the one that was in-charge of the seal’s formation, he might not be able to suppress the Lord of the Nether once again. However, Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy was different.\n With the support of the twelve Divine Beasts, Zhou Weiqing did not have to worry about exhausting his Saint Energy. Furthermore, not only was he able to mobilize the massive Saint Energy, he was able to constantly refine and purify the Saint Energy within his body and erupt it via the Saint God Core Nucleus. This was also the reason why the white incandescent light was as intense as such.\n The Saint Energy that was displayed by Zhou Weiqing was already half as powerful as that of the Creation Stage. Even though it was impossible for him to become a true Creation God in his entire life, his Saint Energy was powerful enough to be able to attack the Lord of the Nether, who was within the formation.\n There was a conflict between the Creation and Destructive forces; the black and white energy collided violently within the sky. Even though the energy from both sides did not detonate, they were being exhausted at an alarming rate.\n The entire formation had completely lit up, except that the red misty luster gradually turned white.\n At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was extremely calm. After he had received the Dragon Emperor’s original energy, the Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation underwent another round of evolution, causing his ice-cold perception to increase to an unprecedented level. He was able to clearly sense the marvel in every corner of the seal’s formation, and he was constantly comprehending it. Relying on his powerful will that was on the Heavenly Change level, under the amplification of the formation, he controlled the formation, resulting in a frenzied pressure on the Lord of the Nether.\n The Lord of the Nether let out a sharp cry that was filled with extreme fear. His original Destructive Energy was no longer effective under the suppression of the Saint Energy. Both parties had reached a stalemate. However, even though the original Destructive Energy at the center was capable of resisting Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy, the circles of black halo that it emitted could not completely withstand the pressure exerted from the massive victorious vortex.\n Stands and threads of whitish golden light began to gradually penetrate the Destructive halos, and constantly approached the formation on the ground. Some areas had already merged with the red light that was emitted from the formation.\n As the saying went - ‘a single spark can start a prairie fire’; after the red light from the formation came into contact with the whitish golden Nebula Saint Energy, the color of the formation immediately started to change.\n The Saint Energy’s ability to assimilate was extremely remarkable; it manipulated the attributes on the formation to go through changes. Hence, naturally, the pressure on the Lord of the Nether continuously increased.\n Joy gradually appeared in the eyes of the twelve Divine Beasts, and they looked more resolute as well.\n At the start, when the Dragon Emperor decided to get Zhou Weiqing to replace him, the majority of the Divine Beasts were unable to accept his decision. However, at this moment, they had completely believed in the Dragon Emperor’s foresight. Even though this young man before them was stronger than the Dragon Emperor, he looked like he was only in his twenties!\n The Dragon Emperor had died and departed this world without even leaving his corpse or bones behind. However, his will did not vanish. Every single one of the Divine Beasts were completely dedicated to his cause - they would not let the Lord of the Nether escape into the human world no matter what.\n Looking at the Saint Energy establishing contact with the formation, while the Lord of the Nether, on the other hand, was unable to break through the Saint Energy light that Zhou Weiqing had condensed, the Divine Beasts were full of hope, that they were able to seal the Lord of the Nether once again!\n Unity was indeed strength! At this moment, none of the Divine Beasts held back their cultivation base - they were not bothered about injuring themselves and activated the Heavenly Energy within their bodies at full force to support Zhou Weiqing. On the other hand, the Saint Energy was continuously nourishing their bodies, ensuring that they would not get injured at all.\n The Sidhe Empress took the Ancient Tree of Life with her and landed far away from the site. Looking at everything that was happening, excitement gradually appeared in both her beautiful eyes. However, whenever she glanced over at Zhou Weiqing’s solemn face, there would be a despondent look in her eyes. She dared not say that Zhou Weiqing’s present achievements would never be surpassed in the future, but they were definitely unprecedented. At least from what she remembered, she had not met a powerhouse that was as powerful as Zhou Weiqing.\n Outside the abyss.\n “Weiqing, where’s Weiqing?” Shangguan Bing’er was the first to snap out of the perplexed state of mind. After she regained her consciousness, she yelled almost immediately.\n The sky had already turned into a shade of azure; the sun shone onto the ground, bringing about a faint sense of warmth within the originally cold northern border. When the sunlight shone onto an individual’s body, it would make him or her feel very comfortable.\n However, at this moment, Shangguan Bing’er was not basking in the warmth feeling. That was because a familiar figure was not standing before her.\n Shangguan Fei’er, Shangguan Xue’er and Little Witch woke up one after another. After a brief moment of feeling perplexed, their regained their consciousness.\n Shangguan Bing’er saw the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya at once and ran over to him immediately, “Master, where’s Weiqing? Where did Weiqing go?” Despite the fact that she already had the answers, at this moment, she was unable to accept or acknowledge the truth.\n “Little Fatty Zhou, you bastard. You dared to knock us out before running away. Just you wait……” Shangguan Fei’er was filled with rage as she yelled. However, as she was yelling, her eyes could not help but become red.\n Little Witch stood there in a daze; she was replaying everything that Zhou Weiqing said to her, before she lost her consciousness, in her mind. At this moment, she felt empty.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-305-1","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
