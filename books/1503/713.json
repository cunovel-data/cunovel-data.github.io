(3) Heavenly Kings not only had a terrifying amount of Heavenly Energy, they also saw their mental energy and spiritual energy skyrocket to an unprecedented new level which was more than enough to sustain the costs incurred by creating a God Tier Consolidating Scroll. Even so, God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters generally were in poor physical shape, precisely because the process of creating God Tier Consolidating Scrolls was just so incredibly taxing. Zhou Weiqing wasn’t too bad off, because the Consolidating Scroll he was creating was for the sixth piece of his Hate Ground No Handle set. If he was trying to make the final piece, the process of creating the tenth Consolidating Scroll would be terrifyingly exhausting. This was the reason why Duan Tianlang had taught so many things to Zhou Weiqing. He wasn’t sure if he would be able to stay alive after helping Zhou Weiqing finish the tenth piece of the Hate Ground No Handle set. In the past, Zhou Weiqing didn’t really understand this. Now that he was truly creating a God Tier Consolidating Scroll of his own for the first time, he gradually began to understand what Duan Tianlang’s intentions were. The damn thing is really a pain in the ass! Can he succeed? Can he succeed?! The two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters looked just as wan and pale as Zhou Weiqing himself, as if they were using up an enormous amount of mental energy as well. They were firmly memorizing every single stroke of the Zhou Weiqing’s pen, but with Zhou Weiqing occasionally employing Time Reversal to replicate certain strokes, it made the memorization process even more difficult. Of course, they were also able to tell that Zhou Weiqing had reached the final stages of creating this Consolidating Scroll. It was about to finish. Faint light flickered across the scroll as Zhou Weiqing’s face turned increasingly solemn. He knew that his mental energy was at the brink of collapse, but this actually spurred on his innate, bone-deep stubbornness even further. He gritted his teeth. No matter what, he was going to persevere. It wasn’t just for the sake of completing this God Tier Consolidating Scroll. It was also a way for him to demonstrate mastery over his own willpower. So long as he could complete this, it would be very beneficial for his future cultivation. Zhou Weiqing also had the vague feeling that if he could complete this God Tier Consolidating Scroll, then he would also be able to break through to the thirty-seventh stage of Saint Energy, which had vexed him for so long. How could he possibly resist such an alluring prize? If he gave up this chance, who knew how long it would be before he would make his Saint Energy breakthrough? Once the Saint Energy broke past the thirty-sixth stage, each further upgrade could no longer be achieved simply through hard work and motivation. Fate and fortune both played a role. Chances like today were few and far between! The world outside slowly began to grow dark, but the three people inside the room didn’t light any candles. They were afraid that even the tiniest of movements would disturb Zhou Weiqing and cause his creation of this scroll to fail. The dim light from the scroll flickered across Zhou Weiqing’s sweat-covered face. Only a tiny dab of Consolidating Ink was left within the crystal basin. The final stroke. He had finally come down to the final stroke. Zhou Weiqing’s eyes suddenly narrowed to tiny slits as the Consolidating Pen in his hand began to tremble slightly for the first time. The atmosphere inside the entire room became oppressively heavy, while Shangguan Bing’er clenched her hands into fists. Boom! Failure. Just as Zhou Weiqing finished his final stroke, the Consolidating Paper instantly exploded beneath him. The Time Reversal effect once more took place, but this time Zhou Weiqing’s body shuddered. The intense mental strain he was under caused even his mighty body to suffer serious repercussions. Blood began to spill out from his nose, mouth, and ears. It looked absolutely terrifying. I must succeed! Zhou Weiqing repeated these words to himself, his right hand once more transforming to become silvery-white, causing his trembling hand to instantly stabilize. He was willing to sacrifice many things for the sake of completing this God Tier Consolidating Scroll. Even if he had to reveal some of the secrets behind his Saint Energy, he still had to complete this. Otherwise, this failure could well result in his future advancement in Saint Energy coming to a complete halt. Prior to actually embarking on the process of creating this God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll, Zhou Weiqing had been very confident in his chances. He had the Time Reversal Skill, and his nine-Jeweled stage of Saint Energy, which when combined was an unparalleled tool for creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. He had felt certain that he was absolutely the equal of any Heavenly King God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, but when he actually began the process he finally understood just how difficult it was to actually create a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll. If it hadn’t been for the Time Reversal Skill, he would’ve failed more than a hundred times by now. Ordinary God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters couldn’t afford a single mistake, needing to finish it all at once! In other words, an absolutely gaping chasm in skill existed between Zhou Weiqing and genuine God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters. However, he was relying on Time Reversal to forcefully bridge that gap! Thankfully, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters didn’t notice the change in the attribute of ‘Heavenly Energy’ which Zhou Weiqing had just released. Their gazes were completely focused on that nearly-finished scroll which had just undergone Time Reversal once more. The final stroke of a pen from a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master… this gave onlookers the highest chances to suddenly be enlightened. These two were no exceptions. Thus, they chose to completely ignore the silvery light glowing from Zhou Weiqing’s arm and the unique aura of the Saint Energy, which whisper that it was the heart of the very world itself. Those things were irrelevant to them, after all. Zhou Weiqing had also produced so many miracles that they simply relegated ‘Saint Energy’ into the category of a secret art which the Legacy of Strength possessed. Silver light flashed as the tip of the Consolidating Pen in Zhou Weiqing’s hands sketched outwards. Blood covered his entire face, dripping downwards and giving him a rather terrifying appearance. Suddenly, dazzling silver light exploded forth from the Consolidating Paper, transforming into an incomparably dense silver aura. The blood dripping from Zhou Weiqing’s face was instantly evaporated, while he himself staggered several steps backwards. He only managed to remain upright thanks to Shangguan Bing’er supporting him. The ball of silver light atop the yellow rosewood table only grew brighter and brighter as the atmospheric energies around it rose to an incredible density. It all furiously poured into the scroll atop the table, which seemed to have come alive. Consolidating Equipment Scrolls of any level, when first formed, would absorb atmospheric energies from the natural world. The only difference lay in the amount being consumed. Middle level or high level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls only absorbed a tiny amount of atmospheric energies, so little that Heavenly Jewel Masters wouldn’t even be able to sense it. Grandmaster Tier Consolidating Scrolls would absorb a noticeably greater amount of energy, while God Tier Consolidating Scrolls would absorb an absolutely terrifying amount. If one had to give a specific ‘amount’ of energy, any such scroll would at least need to absorb all the energy from the Heavenly Core Nucleus of a Heavenly King in order to be completed. Thus, any God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master would choose to let his new scroll absorb atmospheric energies in order to complete it. This was an important reason why Heaven’s Expanse Palace was able to recruit its three God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters. There were very few places in all the Boundless Mainland which had densities of atmospheric energies comparable to Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Of course, Heavenly Snow Mountain was also another such place, but when compared to Heaven’s Expanse Palace? Not only was the Heavenly Snow Mountain consisting and ruled by other races, its level of atmospheric energies was still slightly weaker in comparison. This place, without question, was also such a place with an extremely high density of atmospheric energies. As soon as Zhou Weiqing finished creating the scroll, he himself could clearly sense that an enormous amount of atmospheric energies was rushing out from the gorge around them and flooding into this wooden room. This caused the previously-ordinary levels of atmospheric energy to instantly skyrocket to an incredibly dense level. Although Zhou Weiqing didn’t know why or how this was happening, it was obvious that the atmospheric energies here were formed by nature itself. There was no way any human force could create it. The silver glow slowly began to transform into a faint gold color, which then slowly began to transform into a crystal clear gold. At the very end, it finally transformed into deep and highly concentrated dark-gold color. Suddenly all of the light retreated into the scroll, no longer emanating outwards. As for the torrent of atmospheric energies which had been flooding into the room, they instantly vanished as well. Everything fell completely silent. The two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters who had jumped over to the other side of the table returned to their seats, slumping exhaustedly into them while closing their eyes. Their chests silently rose and fell as they breathed deeply. Clearly, they were completely exhausted as well. Zhou Weiqing had an absolutely ear-splitting headache right now. He watched as the dark-golden scroll atop the yellow rosewood table slowly floated up into the air, filled with a strange aura. Only then did he finally let out a sigh of relief… and then collapsed into Shangguan Bing’er’s embrace. In all of recorded history, there had never been a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master who was merely twenty or so years of age, much less someone who was able to create a God Tier Consolidating Scroll the way Zhou Weiqing just did. However, he had succeeded. He had truly succeeded. Shangguan Bing’er half-carried the fainted Zhou Weiqing over to a nearby chair, helping him sit down. The Saint Energy in his body remained as full and abundant as either, and it was even able to maintain his false ‘five-Jeweled stage’. As a result, she knew that her man was fine. He was simply mentally drained to the point where his body could no longer take it, causing him to lapse into slumber. After roughly the time needed for half a stick of incense to burn down, the other two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters slowly opened their eyes. The first thing they did was to turn and stare at the scroll hovering above the wooden table. The woman slowly rose to her feet. She was extremely tall, half a head taller than even Shangguan Bing’er. She slowly reached out with her right hand, causing the scroll to drift into it and then unfurl. She lowered her head to stare at the complicated, abstruse sketches and runes covering the scroll, her beautiful eyes revealing a hint of being mesmerized by what she saw. The old man was standing next to her, staring carefully as well. “This is, without question, a true and genuine God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll. It isn’t a Pseudo-God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll.” The old man quickly came to this conclusion after just a few glances. The young woman nodded. “He cannot be simply described as a ‘genius’. He’s a freak of nature, an absolute monster, a genius without peer.” She turned, her gaze falling upon the face of the still-fainted Zhou Weiqing. Shangguan Bing’er had already wiped the blood off of Zhou Weiqing’s face, and he continued to slumber deeply in her embrace. Shangguan Bing’er lifted her head up and glanced at them. Rather puzzled, she asked, “What’s a Pseudo-God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll?” The woman blinked. “He didn’t tell you?” Shangguan Bing’er shook his head. “I’m not a Consolidating Equipment Master, and I never disturb him with such questions.” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-241-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis] In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
