{"id":52022,"no":848,"title":"Chapter 289 - The Grand Tournament Begins (1)","content":"Even though the Heavenly Demon Sect had always been ranked last in the Grand Tournament, it was still a Saint Land! The legacy of the Demonic Attribute continued to instill fear in the rest of the four Great Saint Lands. Nobody had ever expected the Demonic Emperor Wu Yueyun to hand over the Heavenly Demon Sect over to Zhou Weiqing, a young man. In their eyes, it was something completely impossible.\n Everyone’s gazes fell upon Zhou Weiqing once again and Fen Tian asked out of curiosity, “The Peerless Sect. It is my first time hearing its name. Even a small fry like him can become the leader of a Saint Land. Brother Long, I think that the real master of the Peerless Sect is you, am I right? You’re going to let your disciple make a fool of himself?”\n Long Shiya glared coldly at Fen Tian, “My disciple is making a fool of himself? Fen Tian, watch your tongue. When I was ruling the world, you were still still in your mother’s womb. So what if my disciple becomes the leader of a Saint Land? He is not just going to be your average leader, he is going to be the leader of the number one Saint Land. Everything will be revealed in just a moment.”\n When Long Shiya talked about the Peerless Sect being the number one Saint Land, it seemed to have touch the nerves of the other four Great Saint Lands. Their gazes turned hostile immediately. \n Zhou Weiqing smiled, “Now, our Peerless Sect is qualified to take part in the Grand Tournament, right? If anyone here is unwilling to accept this arrangement, I don’t mind if you regard us as the Heavenly Demon Sect. Except that the Sect Leader is different.”\n Fen Tian laughed coldly, “Heavenly Demon Sect? Even the Heavenly Demon Sect is not qualified to take part in the Grand Tournament. Don’t you know that the Heavenly Demon Sect has been taken out of the list?”\n Zhou Weiqing looked at him, while smiling continuously, “Earlier, Brother Gu had mentioned that a Saint Land is regarded as one by virtue of power. Be it the Peerless Sect or the Heavenly Demon Sect, as long as we possess great power, why can’t we be regarded as a Saint Land? If Hell Lord Fen Tian wants to give us some pointers, I don’t mind at all. Besides, quite a number of your people from the Blood Red Hell had truly gone to hell in my hands.” \n A baleful look flashed across Fen Tian’s eyes, but he did not step out to attack Zhou Weiqing. Instead, he turned to the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian, who was next to him, and said in a low voice, “Brother Xue, this Grand Tournament is held on your grounds, and you are the master of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Naturally, you are the decision maker of the tournament. How do you want to deal with this matter at hand? A Saint Land appearing out of nowhere - I am sure this is against the rules, right?”\n Listening to Fen Tian’s words, Zhou Weiqing could not help but be slightly impressed by him. From the looks of it, the Blood Red Hell was not only powerful, they were also very scheming!\n Xue AoTian looked at Fen Tian and said, “Fen Tian, perhaps you don’t fully know what is happening. Weiqing is my son-in-law. Earlier, he had mentioned before, a Saint Land is established as one by virtue of power. Since my son-in-law had already brought his people along with him, it proves that he is confident enough. Furthermore, Brother Long is a senior who I respect. With Brother Long and Sect Leader Wu, I believe they are powerful enough to be deemed as a Saint Land.”\n Over at the Passion Valley’s side, Huang Xingyun furrowed his brows, “Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, this is against the rules. What do you think, Brother Tianyang?”\n Shangguan Tianyang said indifferently, “If they are powerful enough, it’s not a big deal having one more Saint Land. Since the Blood Red Hell is the most displeased with the Peerless Sect, why doesn’t the Blood Red Hell send someone out to test how powerful they are?”\n Fen Tian narrowed his eyes and snorted coldly, “Fine, I will send out a disciple. As long as the Peerless Sect has a disciple that can defeat my disciple, the Blood Red Hell will agree to let them participate in the Grand Tournament.”\n As he spoke, Fen Tian waved his hand. A middle-aged man who looked like he was in his forties stepped out from behind him. He was not tall, but his limbs were long and slender. The joints on his hands were thick and huge. He gave off a gloomy vibe, making him seem very sinister on the whole. He looked over to the Peerless Sect with his yellowish eyes, emitting an undisguised strong ominous aura. \n Wu Yunyue snorted coldly. He was about to step forward but was stopped by Zhou Weiqing, “Deputy Sect Leader, the Hell Lord Fen Tian had already mentioned that he wanted to test our disciples’ powers. You are one of the higher ranking figures here, so you should not step in. Ling Dang, go ahead and have a battle against the Blood Red Hell expert. Remember to show some mercy.”\n Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, a person who was wearing a cloak that covered his face stepped out from behind. Judging by her delicate figure, that person was clearly a woman.\n She walked out elegantly, and just like before, her aura could not be detected at all. However, she seemed to have arrived in the center of the summit of the Heavenly Snow Mountain with just one step. \n Looking at the person in a blue robe that Zhou Weiqing referred to as ‘Ling Dang’, he laughed coldly, “Look at you concealing your identity. You don’t even dare to show your face? Don’t tell me this is an old witch that is so ugly that she dare not show her fact in public?”\n She had the figure of a woman, and since she was a powerhouse who could make it there, she was definitely not that young. It was justifiable for that Blood Red Hell powerhouse to call her ‘an old witch’\n However, upon hearing his words, Zhou Weiqing burst out laughing. He thought to himself: This Blood Red Hell bastard is sure unlucky.\n Hearing his words, Ling Dang trembled sightly, she clearly looked rather agitated. She slowly lifted her head. Everyone could see that apart from the cloak that was concealing her face, she was wearing another blue face mask, only revealing a pair of beautiful emerald green eyes. However, at this moment, those eyes were icy cold. \n “Let’s begin.” Ling Dang’s voice resonated in the air. Before waiting for her opponent’s reply, she had already lifted her right hand.\n Her movement was not fast, and she had no intention of equipping herself with any Consolidated Equipment. Her exposed palm was pale and slim; her fingers were as delicate as spring - they looked as though they were carved from a piece of jade. Still, she did not emit any aura or any energy ripples at all. All she did was thrust her palm out in the direction of the Blood Red Hell powerhouse.\n Naturally, Fen Tian had his reasons for sending this man out to fight. This fierce-looking middle-aged man was actually in his eighties. Even though he had not reached the Heavenly Emperor Stage, he was already at the Max Level Heavenly King Stage. Previously, Fen Tian had stated his intentions clearly - he wanted to test the power of the Peerless Sect’s disciples on behalf of all the other Saint Lands. In other words, he wanted to examine the true hidden powers of the Peerless Sect. If the person who was being sent out was Long Shiya or Wu Yunyue, naturally, the Peerless Sect would lose their prestige, and Fen Tian would then be able to disqualify them from the Grand Tournament. If the Peerless Sect sent out an actual disciple, then this Max Level Heavenly King of the Blood Red Hell would definitely emerge victorious. A Max Level Heavenly King with destructive energy could even stand a chance against a Heavenly Emperor. Fen Tian doubted that Zhou Weiqing had any other Heavenly Emperors on their side. \n However, most of the time, expectations and wishes might be perfect, but they might not turn into reality. \n Looking at Ling Dang’s palm that was thrusting towards himself, the Blood Red Hell man in red was cautious. Dark red flames instantly erupted from his body. Strong destructive willpower that was filled with damaging aura was felt. Light from the eight pieces of his Consolidated Equipment was flashing as they came together to form a full set, as it appeared on his body.\n The eight pieces of God Tier Master Consolidated Equipment Set could be considered as a legendary set. \n However, as he was equipping himself with the set, suddenly, under everyone’s aghast gazes, the dark red flames around his body had vanished immediately. Immediately after, a crash sound was heard and the man in red had actually flew out upon impact, heading in the direction of the area where the Blood Red Hell powerhouses were gathered. \n “Huh” Fen Tian was dumbstruck and instinctively reached his right hand out in a bid to catch him. However, in the next moment, a bang was heard, followed by a clutter of flesh and blood splattered all over before his eyes.\n The Blood Red Hell powerhouse that Fen Tian had full confidence in was blown to pieces in the air, becoming fragments that flew in all directions. Until this moment, the dark red flames appeared once again. Except that, the one who got destroyed was not the Peerless Sect’s Ling Dang, but it was the Blood Red Hell man himself. Under the flickering dark red flames, the splattered flesh turned into ashes, scattered in all directions.\n The palm that Ling Dang thrusted did a grabbing motion. Immediately, the Heavenly Core Nucleus of the Blood Red Hell man flickered and vanished into thin air.\n From beginning to end, the battle happened too quickly, to the extent that almost everyone had no time to react. \n As the battle ended just like that, Ling Dang calmly walked back to the Peerless Sect and silently stood in her position. The entire peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain was so quiet that one could hear the drop of a pin.\n Even the two Shangguan brothers, Tianyang and Tianyue, who had already known about the return of the Peerless Sect, as well as their power, were completely taken by shock. On the other hand, the leaders of the other Saint Lands had different expressions on their faces.\n The Passion Valley’s Huang Xingyun was completely stunned. Even till this very moment, he was in disbelief with regards to what happened. \n Xue AoTian looked even more astonished compared to Shangguan Tianyang. That was because before Ling Dang launched her attack, he had detected the presence of some energy ripples. He also realized that he was not confident of being able to retreat upon receiving a blow as such. \n Fen Tian still had a cold look in his eyes. It was horrifyingly gloomy and cold. He stared coldly at Ling Dang, “Never did I expect the Peerless Sect to hide such an expert. May I ask, what’s the name of this expert?”\n Fen Tian was not angered by the death of his subordinate. His calm disposition had even caused Zhou Weiqing to raise his brows slightly. He smiled, “Ling Dang is a member of my Peerless Sect. Apart from this, I have nothing else to say. How was the test, Hell Lord? I believe our Peerless Sect is qualified enough to take part in the Grand Tournament, right?”\n Fen Tian exchanged glances with Zhou Weiqing. Zhou Weiqing suddenly realized that his gaze had become a lot darker than before, causing Zhou Weiqing to be stunned for a moment. However, Fen Tian’s gaze quickly returned to its normal state. What made Zhou Weiqing extremely shocked was the fact that he actually nodded and said, “Since your sect is powerful enough, naturally it is qualified to join the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands. The Blood Red Hell has no objections.”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-289-1","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
