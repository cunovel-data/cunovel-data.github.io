He had already done whatever he could have done, succeeded in everything he had come to do, and it was time to slowly wait patiently to reap the benefits.\\n\\n On the third day that Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya had arrived at the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the entire mountain had finally quietened down as all the wedding guests had finally left. Phelia had also left silently, as she had her own responsibilities as a Guardian to tend to, and could not disappear for too long.\\n\\n When Zhou Weiqing finally saw Tian\u0027er again, her eyes were red from crying about her mother\u0027s leaving. Although they had only been together for three days, after listening to her explanations and apologies, she had quickly forgiven Phelia. It was not all Phelia\u0027s fault, but that set of responsibility was just too heavy.\\n\\n \"Little Fatty, Father is looking for you.\" Tian\u0027er stood at the entrance of Zhou Weiqing\u0027s room, calling him lightly.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing leapt to his feat, swiftly holding Tian\u0027er in his arms and planting a kiss on her lips without warning. \"So fragrant! Dearest, what is my Lord Father-in-Law looking for me for?\"\\n\\n Tian\u0027er was originally full of sorrow from her mother\u0027s leaving, but with Zhou Weiqing messing around, she couldn\u0027t help but blush a deep red, and the sorrow in her heart lessened slightly.\\n\\n \"How would I know what Father is looking for you for. You naughty fellow, you\u0027re here in the Heavenly Snow Mountain and you still don\u0027t behave a little.\"\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, swiping a finger lightly across her cute nose as he said proudly: \"Why should I behave? You are my wife. It is a natural thing for man and wife to be intimate, nothing to be ashamed of!\"\\n\\n Tian\u0027er gave a humph and said: \"I haven\u0027t agreed to marry you yet. You have only passed Father\u0027s test, not my test!\"\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, giving her a perverted leer as he said softly: \"Alright! Tonight I will let you test me all you want, how about that? Heh heh.\"\\n\\n Tian\u0027er blushed even deeper, giving Zhou Weiqing\u0027s waist a savage pinch and twist before she said: \"When we are still in the Heavenly Snow Mountain, you\u0027re not allowed to do anything funny. Father\u0027s senses extend throughout the entire area.\"\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing blinked innocently and said: \"Heh, so that is to say that when we leave the Heavenly Snow Mountain, we can...\"\\n\\n \"You terrible fellow, come on let\u0027s go!\" Tian\u0027er\u0027s face grew redder, but her eyes were mischievous and delightful, without any hint of rejection. She had always been a bold girl who dared to hate or love, and was also a Heavenly Beast cultivated to Human, without many of the bashfulness that female humans had. Love was love, and she was willing to do anything for the man she loved.\\n\\n If one were to say that she previously had some ill feelings in her heart about Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u0027er\u0027s relationship, but this time after Zhou Weiqing had come to the Heavenly Snow Mountain at such a huge risk of his life just to snatch her back... such courage and resolution had already proven his love for her. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing had used his own strength to defeat Gu Yingbing, proving himself even further to her! In Tian\u0027er\u0027s heart, her Little Fatty was already more perfect than her father!\\n\\n Led by Tian\u0027er, Zhou Weiqing was quickly brought to another icy chamber.\\n\\n As soon as he entered, he immediately sensed the temperature drop drastically. The entire Heavenly Snow Mountain was already so cold, but this temperature was a whole level colder, and even with his physique and cultivation level, he couldn\u0027t help but shudder slightly.\\n\\n There was only a single piece of furniture in the entire room, a stone bed. Xue AoTian sat right upon it, and as he saw Tian\u0027er walk into the room with Zhou Weiqing, hand in hand, his expression was gentle.\\n\\n \"Father, I have brought him here.\" Tian\u0027er told Xue AoTian.\\n\\n Xue AoTian looked at Zhou Weiqing and said: \"Tian\u0027er, leave us for a while. I have some words to speak to this little brat alone.\"\\n\\n Tian\u0027er started momentarily, before she held onto Zhou Weiqing\u0027s hand even tighter. Reproachfully, she said: \"Father!\"\\n\\n Xue AoTian said exasperatedly: \"A grown girl truly cannot be kept at home anymore... would I hurt him? Go go.\"\\n\\n Tian\u0027er flushed prettily, and she glanced at Zhou Weiqing before leaving reluctantly.\\n\\n Xue AoTian looked at Zhou Weiqing. His expression was calm and unflurried, but from his brow and eyes, Zhou Weiqing could sense a hint of sorrow. Clearly, Phelia\u0027s leaving still left his heart feeling extremely uncomfortable.\\n\\n \"Weiqing, Phelia has told me all about the agreement between you and her. To be honest, if you were an outsider, no matter what price I have to pay, I will groom you to do that. However, you are also Tian\u0027er\u0027s husband, and for my daughter\u0027s sake, well-being and happiness, I will not force you to do so. Tell me, what do you think about the whole matter?\"\\n\\n Hearing Xue AoTian\u0027s words, Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: \"Sir, Father in Law, my thinking is very simple. I will not take risks.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Xue AoTian arched a brow, looking at him in slight surprise.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing continued: \"If I do not have absolute confidence, I will not attempt to join in that matter... otherwise it is not only harmful to myself, but to others as well. Not only will it fail to let Mother-in-Law return to your side, Tian\u0027er will also suffer as a widow. Something like that I will definitely not do. I have chosen to shoulder that responsibility and to work towards it, but I will not attempt it without absolute confidence.\"\\n\\n Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u0027s words, Xue AoTian smiled and nodded, saying: \"With those words of yours, I can set my mind at ease. You little rascal, you are far more wiser and mature than any of your own age. However, you are trying to take away my daughter, and I cannot bear that as well... so how should we deal with that?\"\\n\\n A strange expression crossed Zhou Weiqing\u0027s face, and he said tentatively: \"How about... you come along with Tian\u0027er. I don\u0027t mind having you come along to guide us in cultivating.\"\\n\\n Xue AoTian said exasperatedly: \"You\u0027re trying to gain another bruiser to help you? Stop dreaming. Having the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor by your side isn\u0027t enough for you?\"\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \"I\u0027m just joking around. However, Father-in-law, to be honest, aren\u0027t you bored and lonely staying in the Heavenly Snow Mountain all day long just cultivating? As Mother-in-Law has already said, just like my Master does not have any possibility of breaking through to the Heavenly God Tier in his lifetime, you also do not have any possibility of breaking through past the Heavenly God Tier. What is the point of staying shut-in in the Heavenly Snow Mountain? The world outside is so huge, and even if you are already at the Heavenly God Tier, I\u0027m sure you haven\u0027t explored every nook and cranny of the world. Why not come on out and see the world, who knows if you relax and have a change of perspective, enjoy yourself, and it might even have a better effect on your cultivation?\" [1. He is using the respectful term of you/your 您 instead of 你 throughout the speech]\\n\\n Xue AoTian started momentarily before laughing in spite of himself. \"Only you, little brat, would ever dare to speak to me like that. For me to stay in the Heavenly Snow Mountain... it is not just because of cultivating... more as an awe or threat. Do you really think that the WanShou Empire is that stable? That easy to control? Especially with so many different Tribes? Without the Heavenly Snow Mountain above them all, even the grand WanShou Empire would splinter and break apart before long... and be destroyed.\"\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile and said: \"From a certain perspective, I am still enemies with the WanShou Empire. The war between the WanShou Empire and Humankind has gone on for years, decades, longer than even I know. Every year, countless of lives die, not just humans, but on both sides. Father in law, is there a need for that?\"\\n\\n Xue AoTian looked at him passively before saying: \"In this world, the law of the jungle is the ultimate law of nature. The weak are the prey of the strong, that is life. More importantly, the world needs a certain balance.\"\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing looked at Xue AoTian, puzzled. \"Balance?\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-22-chapter-182-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
