Outside the door, Lin TianAo, Duan Tianlang and the others were gathered. Previously, Lin TianAo had also quickly realised that something was wrong with Zhou Weiqing, just that his speed was much slower. When he rushed back, he had quickly went to look for the person with the highest cultivation level in the entire Crescent City, Duan Tianlang, inviting the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master to help.\\n\\n Although Duan Tianlang had never seen the four Saint Attributes fusion before, his experience was far stronger than any of the others. Instantly, he realised that Zhou Weiqing was currently slowly easing past the crisis under the help of the four fused Saint Attributes. As such, he had held Lin TianAo back, and both of them waited outside the door. As soon as Shangguan Xue’er’s Heavenly Energy was not sufficient to support Tian’er, he would immediately move forward to replace her to aid Tian’er.\\n\\n Gradually, Zhou Weiqing’s body turned back to his original look, the scales vanishing, his legs and hands resuming their human form. The horrific cracks and tears on his skin also started healing with the help of the Divine energy, though his skin still looked pale and pallid. Luckily, his breathing was still relatively even.\\n\\n “I’m alright now, Tian’er. Thanks…” Taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing slowly stood up. The raging bloodline energy within his body had finally calmed down. He was out of danger, but his vitality was greatly sapped, his face looking terribly pale.\\n\\n Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er slowly reduced their Heavenly Energy infusion before fully withdrawing. Seeing Zhou Weiqing’s ashen face, Tian’er leaped into his arms, crying out: “Little Fatty, you scared me to death!”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing quickly embraced Tian’er tightly, a bitter look on his face. “I wonder who had such power wealth and resolution to do this, to actually hire a Heavenly King assassin to take care of me. I was truly lucky this time, if not this time I would have been killed for sure!”\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er stood at the side, looking at Tian’er in Zhou Weiqing’s embrace. A hint of envy flashed in cold her eyes momentarily; as she saw that Zhou Weiqing was all right, she also relaxed. Previously, when she saw that Zhou Weiqing was so close to death, the urgency and worry in her heart was no lesser than Tian’er’s.\\n\\n Tian’er’s tears soaked Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder, but at the side, Shangguan Xue’er said coldly: “Hey, shouldn’t you at least wear some clothes first?”\\n\\n Tian’er lifted her head to look at Zhou Weiqing. Earlier, due to her worry and nervousness, she had not even realised that due to the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, besides a few critical areas still covered by the remaining shreds his pants, most of Zhou Weiqing’s body was revealed. With a faint blush on her face, her tears finally stopped.\\n\\n Embarrassed, Zhou Weiqing took out a large overcoat from his Spatial Ring and draped it on himself. At that point, Tian’er said viciously: “I wonder who is that bastard who hired that guy… this Heavenly King assassin looks to be extremely professional. In the world of assassins now, I would guess he is at least the top three… if not the top. A Heavenly King stage assassin, it is truly too terrifying. If I find out who that employer is…” A powerful killing intent shot out from Tian’er’s beautiful eyes. She had never been a gentle or peaceful person, and now that someone was targeting her man, how could she not be enraged?\\n\\n In deep thought, Zhou Weiqing pondered out loud: “It is hard to say for sure. However, I am at least quite certain that it isn’t the Kalise Empire or the Bai Da Empire. They should not have such information at hand. We have only just arrived here, and the assassin already reached. He clearly has access to information about me, and at least has a clear understanding of my movements, besides wanting to ensuring my death.”\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er said: “Whoever you threaten, that would be the greatest possibility in wanting to kill you.”\\n\\n Hearing her words, Tian’er’s brow furrowed in slight anger: “What do you mean?”\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er ignored her anger, not afraid of her at all. “When Weiqing set up his Peerless Regiment, it was the greatest threat to your WanShou Empire. For someone to be able to hire a Heavenly King assassin, one must at least have the requisite connections and status… who else could it be?”\\n\\n “Don’t make such dirty unfounded accusations. Weiqing is my husband, how could our Heavenly Snow Mountain take action against him? Father has already agreed to our wedding, and he also knows about our four Saint Attributes fusion. Hmph, if he wanted to kill Weiqing, he could have done so personally when we were on the Heavenly Snow Mountain.”\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er glanced at her before saying: “Use your brains please? Did I say the Heavenly Snow Mountain?”\\n\\n Tian’er started, before saying slowly: “You mean… the Royal Family?”\\n\\n A pondering look on his face, Zhou Weiqing said: “Indeed… to be able to know my current location with such accuracy, and to actually take action against me… I can only think of two possibilities. One is the WanShou Empire… Since I stole you away, even if the Lion Price Gu Yingbing is not willing to take action, the Lion King Gu Site hates me to the core. A possibility is that he sent this assassin instead of his own powerful tribe members is because he fears your Heavenly Snow Mountain, especially your father. The other possibility is… the Fei Li Empire. Our diplomatic party could have also caused them to feel threatened… However, I personally think that the Lion King is the greater suspect.”\\n\\n Tian’er took a deep breath, gritting her teeth with anger as she said: “I’ll write to Father!”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “There is no use, we do not have any concrete evidence. There is no point in telling him about mere guesses. Currently, the most important thing we have to deal with is that assassin. Furthermore, if I can’t even handle such matters, how can I say that I will protect you, to be your husband? Let me handle this matter.”\\n\\n Tian’er said urgently: “But… that fellow is a Heavenly King stage powerhouse, and not any ordinary one. Furthermore, that weapon of his is truly strange, my guess is it is an Assembly Set weapon, otherwise it is impossible for him to have such a powerful offense.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: “Originally, when I brought you down from the Heavenly Snow Mountain, I had such confidence in myself. At least, I had imagined that my current abilities weren’t too bad, that I could be considered strong. However, today’s lesson, while painful, has allowed me to understand that… no matter what, six Jewels are still six Jewels. Although my instantaneous explosive power and other boosts can grant me power far beyond my cultivation level, but if I face a true powerhouse, then it all amounts to nothing. The most important thing now is for me to raise my Heavenly Energy cultivation level!”\\n\\n Tian’er comforted him gently: “Little Fatty, don’t be so hard on yourself. You are demanding too much from yourself. After all, you are not even twenty years old yet! In the entire mainland, to be able to reach such a cultivation level at your age, that number can be counted on one hand. Don’t think too much…”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “It’s not that I want to think too much! I have never been an ambitious person, and if I were alone, I would not care about all that. However, now I have to command the Peerless Regiment to revive my Empire. In the future, the enemies that I will have to face will only be stronger and stronger.”\\n\\n “From the news that the Fei Li Empire had sent, the Dan Dun Empire attacked the Geritimo Empire, and if that doesn’t have the Bai Du Empire’s shadow behind, that would be too strange. In the future, I will definitely clash with the Bai Da Empire, and maybe even the Dan Dun Empire. In that case, I would be facing powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell… that is the power of a Great Saint Lands. The only one I can depend on is myself… as long as my own power is sufficiently strong, only then can I face all these enemies. It looks like I should not be too urgent in attacking, we will focus on stabilizing the Crescent City for now. The first priority for me is to quickly raise my cultivation level and power.”\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er nodded and said: “Your thinking is correct. However, if it is just yourself alone, it will definitely not be enough. Let me write back to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace for them to send some manpower…”\\n\\n Without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing waved his hand in rejection. “No, in reviving my Empire, I can only depend on myself, not on others. If I just depend on your Heaven’s Expanse Palace, or even Tian’er’s Heavenly Snow Mountain’s power. Then, in the future, could my Heavenly Bow Empire still remain autonomous? You do not need to rush to deny it, no matter what, especially in terms of strategic positioning, if either of the two Great Saint Lands move out to aid us, they will definitely have some terms. Even if I were the leader in their position, I would do the same. In this world, there is no such thing as a free lunch.”\\n\\n Tian’er pursed her beautiful lips as she said huffily: “Little Fatty, don’t put everything in such realistic terms, what about me, how do I count?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Both of you are not the same of course, you are my women, we are a family.”\\n\\n Tian’er gave a satisfied smile, a look of bliss on her face. On the other hand, Shangguan Xue’er turned red and muttered: “Who’s your woman…”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing blinked at her innocently and said: “You lost to me to become my wife right! Have you forgotten? At that time, I said that you didn’t have to follow that oath, but you weren’t willing to do so. So, aren’t we a family? Not just you, Bing’er, Fei’er, we are all a family. In fact, since we are all here now, I have some words to speak to you both.”\\n\\n As he spoke up to that point, Zhou Weiqing’s expression turned serious and stern. “As the saying goes, before one can start on an external expedition, the internal must be settled first. If both of you keep fighting between the two of you, it is truly not easy for me to pass the days. I love both of you, and perhaps Xue’er might have came later, and we may not have gone through as much together as Tian’er. However, you already have a position in my heart. So, I ask you both now seriously, can you try to accept each other?”\\n\\n “In others’ eyes, having such two great beauties like you beside me, I should be enjoying a great life. However, I have to tell you both now, in the past few days, enjoying is the last thing I have experienced. All I have felt is suffering, and more suffering.”\\n\\n “Behind every successful man, there are women who have supported him. I truly hope that you all can get along well. In this way, no matter what I am doing, when I think of you all I can be filled with happiness, be filled with motivation. If this continues, when Bing’er and Fei’er returns, it will become worse. I won’t be able to pass my days any longer. If that really happens, once I revive my homeland, I will run away forever and not allow you all to find me again.”\\n\\n “No!” Both Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er exclaimed simultaneously. Both girls exchanged looks, a strange expression on their faces. However, Zhou Weiqing’s threat seemed to have taken effect, and they did not snipe at each other like they would have, only glaring at Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n “If you all are willing to be with me, then please try to accept each other. I thank you both.” Zhou Weiqing said with a bitter smile.\\n\\n Tian’er looked at his pitiful look, thinking about how he said he had been suffering all these days, her eyes turned slightly red as she muttered: “I’ll… I’ll try my best.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing turned his gaze upon Shangguan Xue’er and said: “What about you?”\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er glared at him exasperatedly, but in the end she gave a soft ‘En’ of assent.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled happily. Standing up slowly and shakily, he grabbed onto each other their hands respectively. “That is great. We will soon be facing stronger enemies, and if we can unite and work together, I believe that we can face all difficulties head on.”\\n\\n As he said that, he pulled both girls into his embrace overbearingly. Tian’er submitted happily, but Shangguan Xue’er struggled slightly, unaccustomed to it at all.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-23-chapter-198-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
