The cultivation level of both women continuously rose at an alarming rate under the influence of the strange astral energy feedback. \n As Shangguan Bing’er followed Zhou Weiqing to roam around the Xuantian Continent, her cultivation level was a tad higher than that of Tian’er’s - however the rate she was increasing at was still slower than Tian’er. \n The faint starlight started to emit from Tian’er’s body; she groaned deeply, and the dazzling brilliance mixed with the nebula energy appeared around the area of her chest just like that. The dazzling starlight orbited at a high speed - at every orbit, a huge amount of the massive Astral Saint Energy was absorbed, with even a portion of the reddish-gold energy released in Zhou Weiqing’s ascension process was also absorbed by her. \n Long Shiya saw what was happening in the sky, and the fat on his face was trembling, “Good heavens! These two ladies are consolidating their Heavenly Core Nucleus. We really have lived for nothing. If they could also succeed, there would now be three Heavenly King Stage powerhouses in their twenties.”\n He naturally could tell that under the help of Tian’er, Zhou Weiqing’s situation had already stabilized. \n Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue forced a smile, “It isn’t three Heavenly King Stage powerhouses but two Heavenly Kings and one Heavenly Emperor, a 20-something year old Heavenly Emperor. You know, I really want to yell at someone right now! Dammit! Why didn’t I meet this fella earlier - if I had personally met him earlier, for all you know he would have been my disciple.”\n Long Shiya complacently shot Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue a glance and said, “Too bad, my luck is good, and my foresight is even better. Right now, nobody’s able to steal this darling disciple of mine from me. On the Mainland, there is already nobody who’s more qualified to be his teacher. Brother Wu, we still can’t rest - let your Heavenly King subordinates separate and let us protect the three of them. As long as they successfully evolve, then we wouldn’t have anything to fear even if the Blood Red Hell sends people over.”\n Even though Wu Yunyue was very jealous of Long Shiya, he was similarly in good spirits. Just as he was witnessing the moment when Zhou Weiqing was evolving to Heavenly Emperor, he had already come to a decision. Since everything had been decided, the state of his mind also followed suit and became more relaxed. It had been a long time since he was in such a good mood.\n After laughing heartily, he said, “Brother Long, what do you take Heavenly Kings or Heavenly King Stage powerhouses for? Even if the Blood Red Hell has been in hiding for years, they are gonna be severely weakened this time. Besides, we have annihilated all the other opponents - if they want to get new information, who knows how long it’ll take? Additionally, I believe that even if Blood Red Hell gets hold of this information, they wouldn’t dare to send people over that rashly. The Heavenly Bow Empire ain’t the Heavenly Demon Sect; this fellow Weiqing is on good terms with Heaven’s Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain. Once the first attack fails, if the Blood Red Hell wants to launch another attack, they would need to first consider the power of the two large Empires.”\n Despite saying that, Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue nevertheless began to issue orders to dispatch the remaining Heavenly Kings, while he himself would be overseeing over here with Long Shiya. He continued to stare at the bizarre view of Zhou Weiqing’s ascension.\n At this time, regardless of whether it was Wu Yunyue or the six Heavenly Kings under him, they all experienced some sort of an odd feeling; the injuries within their bodies started recovering at an alarming rate, and that was not all - it felt as though their own cultivation level seemed to be increasing. Without a doubt, this was because earlier on, they had been injected into the Astral Saint Energy by Zhou Weiqing! Under such circumstances, the energy within their bodies made remarkable improvements. \n With regards to the miracle displayed by Zhou Weiqing, they were entirely lost in admiration and no longer had even the slightest doubt. Without question, Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue’s decision would not be faced with any resistance. \n The starlight in the sky shone brightly continuously for one day and one night before gradually dimming down. The light that started dimming down first was the one that came from Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er. \n Back when Zhou Weiqing had ascended to the Heavenly King Stage, it took a very long time. However, this time he had help of the amplification of the feedback of the astral clouds, coupled with its energy that he accumulated, to ascend. Hence, the process was sped up significantly. The biggest contributing factor, however, came from Tian’er. It was indeed due the strange energy emitted from Tian’er’s body that allowed Zhou Weiqing to complete the Astral transformation within his body in such a short period of time. \n At this moment, the Astral Saint Core Nucleus within Zhou Weiqing’s body had also undergone physical transformation, ultimately looking like a nebula. Although the nebula could also be seen in the body in the past, at that time, the Astral Saint Core Nucleus was the main body, with the Astral Saint Energy revolving around it. However, right now, the complete Astral Saint Core Nucleus was being presented directly as a nebula.\n Additionally, the biggest change would be Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Saint Energy - it was originally golden but at this moment it became reddish golden. The change in color also represented a change in power.\n Zhou Weiqing was not sure of how much stronger his current level of cultivation progressed to; he was only clear of the fact that if he were to measure based on the power of energy, he was definitely not at the lower level of the Heavenly Emperor stage - he was at least mid-level. The reason accounting for why he could make such a huge jump was naturally because of the massive Astral Feedback that was drawn over by Tian’er.\n The benefits enjoyed by Tian’er were greater than Zhou Weiqing. Originally she was a far cry from reaching the Heavenly King Stage, but this time she actually managed to make a direct breakthrough to that level. The entire process was simplified to the extent that even Zhou Weiqing could not help but feel slightly jealous.\n This speed of ascension was much higher than Zhou Weiqing’s ascension at the Xuantian Continent.\n After Zhou Weiqing woke up, the first person he looked at was Shangguan Bing’er, who was not far from him. She was still undergoing the process of ascension. Thereafter his glance shifted to Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er within the Astral Saint Energy, who appeared out of nowhere, before gently caressing Tian’er’s lower belly.\n “Tian’er, are you ok? Is our child alright?”\n Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s impatient voice, Tian’er instinctively looked down to her lower belly as well.\n Truth to be told, previously when she came to Zhou Weiqing’s rescue with Shangguan Bing’er, she did not think things through - all she had on her mind was saving Zhou Weiqing and help him succeed in ascending. It wasn’t until the massive amount of saint energy within Zhou Weiqing got channeled into her body that Tian’er realized that she was in danger – with such a massive amount of energy entering her body, what if her baby was negatively affected as a result? \n But at that instant, Tian’er made a choice: she could have another baby, but if she lost her husband she could never have him back. Hence, Tian’er forcefully suppressed her grief and continuously maintained her stance.\n However, in the next moment, she sensed something amiss. Within her lower abdomen, there was a light wiggle movement, as though it could feel her grief. Immediately after, the saint energy that was taller than Zhou Weiqing appeared. Tian’er was absolutely sure that the changes in the nebula in the sky, as well as her speedy ascension, entirely came from the ball of energy within her lower abdomen.\n As she gently caressed her lower belly, Tian’er mumbled sluggishly, “The child’s doing great, even better than last time. It seemed as though he absorbed the most amount of Astral Saint Energy! Previously I couldn’t sense his aura, but right now his presence is apparent enough for me to clearly sense it. If I’m not wrong, his due date will be even earlier than what father predicted.”\n After hearing that his child was fine, Zhou Weiqing heaved a sigh of relief first. He held Tian’er tightly in his arms - at this moment, he was already too emotional and at a loss for words. \n At this time, the nebula in the sky gradually diminished and disappeared. Zhou Weiqing raised his head and looked at the sky. A ray of reddish golden light flashed in his eyes; the dazzling reddish golden starlight was released from within his body, engulfing the bodies of the three Shangguan sisters within it. \n Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er were a tad late - they did not go over with the intention of taking advantage of the energy, and had in fact tarried because they were afraid something bad might happen since their bodies were also filled with Saint Energy. Even though Shangguan Xue’er couldn’t fly, thanks to the help of Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor she could suspend in the air for a short period of time.\n The two sisters were ready to channel the Saint Energy within their body to him in times of need. \n Perhaps it is true that kindness begets kindness, even though they didn’t make it in time for the ‘appetizers’, they did not miss the main course. The clever girls were able to sense the powerful Astral Saint Energy as well as the response of the Saint Energy within their bodies, and they naturally would not let go of such a good opportunity. Alas, they arrived a tad late, making a break through to the Heavenly King stage impossible. Even so, they each reached the peak of the Nine Jeweled Stage.\n Under the protection of Zhou Weiqing’s reddish golden Saint Energy, very quickly, Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er were awakened from the state of cultivation practice. With the protection of Zhou Weiqing’s reddish golden Saint Energy, it was guaranteed that they would not fall.\n Zhou Weiqing realized that if as a Heavenly King he was able to control atmospheric Heavenly Energies of the world and even forcefully take away the Heavenly Energy controlled by any other Heavenly Kings or Emperors, then by all rights he should now be able to directly control the atmospheric Saint Energy.\n That was something he could not feel when he was at the cultivation level of a Heavenly King. After he evolved to the Heavenly Emperor Stage, his sense of awareness had become unfathomably greater. His vast and highly sensitive sense of awareness allowed him to clearly feel every wave of energy in the air, including the subtle Saint Energy in the atmosphere. \n This Saint Energy had been floating in space ever since the creation of the world – its volume was only a thousandth of the ordinary atmospheric energy, which was why even cultivators of the Heavenly God Stage would be unable to feel its existence. As Zhou Weiqing ascended to a Heavenly Emperor, his own Saint Core had become a true Astral Saint Core. He finally could feel the pure, creative power of Saint Energy. Such a level awareness would be unfathomably beneficial to his future cultivation practice. \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-272-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
