(3)\\n\\n However, in that single pinpoint of white sword-light, Zhou Weiqing’s Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura was pierced right through and destroyed.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s combat experience was rich and plentiful. Under such a disadvantageous position, the ‘crying-face’ Hammer in his right hand swept forward, a thick blue light exploding out from it.\\n\\n A massive explosion. Only then did the snow white light rebounded away, revealing Shangguan Xue’er there, but Zhou Weiqing had staggered back six steps before he recovered his balance.\\n\\n With a single blow from her sword, Shangguan Xue’er had not only broken through five layers of his Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, she had even forced him back. More so, that intense sword intent caused Zhou Weiqing to feel a slight sense of numbness.\\n\\n Currently, Shangguan Xue’er still had her eyes closed. As for Zhou Weiqing, even as he was staggering back, his dual Legendary Hammers were already in movement.\\n\\n The Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation glowed brilliantly, and balls of blue light floated out from the Legendary Hammers one after the other, blotting up the area as they floated towards Shangguan Xue’er.\\n\\n This was the major advantage of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, not only the nearly infinite Heavenly Energy, but also the lack of a cooldown for those mimicked Skills. In his training, Zhou Weiqing had chosen his main offensive Attribute to be the Lightning Attribute.\\n\\n Amongst his six Attributes, the Lightning Attribute was not the strongest. However, it was without question that the burst damage potential of the Lightning Attribute was one of the strongest, without too much Heavenly Energy expenditure. Zhou Weiqing’s choice was a constant stream of attacks that wouldn’t stop. If it were any of his other Attributes, that would not match his requirement. As such, he had chosen the Lightning Attribute. After all, do not forget that his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation also allowed him to Fuse Attributes.\\n\\n With Zhou Weiqing’s current cultivation level, he would not be able to fuse all Six Attribute like Long Shiya could, but fusing two or three was no issue.\\n\\n At least several hundred of those Lightning pearls flew out, and under the fine control of Zhou Weiqing, it fully covered Shangguan Xue’er and any possible retreat or dodging options and angles.\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes remained closed, the Boundless Infinitum Sword was trembling slightly. That trembling was actually due to the strike from the ‘crying-face’ hammer.\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er’s sword skills and sword intent, along with the explosive power of the Boundless Infinitum Sword, it was truly a terrifying power indeed. However, Zhou Weiqing with his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set and all the pure physical strength he had was not something that could be easily dismissed as well, especially in his Dragon-Tiger Transformation state. Even Shangguan Xue’er at full power was not able to clash with him directly. The reason why Zhou Weiqing staggered back six steps was not because of the direct power, but the sword intent held within. If he had not retreated, he would have been injured by the sword intent.\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er’s expression remained impassive, as if those several hundred Lightning pearls were not a threat to her.\\n\\n In that next instant, the Boundless Infinitum Sword burst into action. As compared to the previous ‘body and sword as one’, it was now a steady and smooth flow of actions. All Zhou Weiqing could see was countless slim white threads burst forth from the sword.\\n\\n Each and every strike landed perfectly on a Lightning pearl, as Shangguan Xue’er spun around in a move that seemed like a beautiful dance move, all the Lightning pearls had been swept aside, not a single one exploding.\\n\\n This was not an easy feat indeed. In order to ensure that a Lightning pearl did not explode, the only way was to strike it right in the center heart of it, destroying its core before it could explode, not allowing the Lightning Element Attribute Heavenly Energy within to be unleashed.\\n\\n More importantly, those several hundred Lightning pearls were all under Zhou Weiqing’s control. Yet, all of them had been dealt with by Shangguan Xue’er in a single instant. What kind of swordsmanship was that?! Let alone seeing anything like this before, Zhou Weiqing had not even heard of such a thing!\\n\\n At this point, Shangguan Xue’er’s entire body was surrounded by a layer of blue light; after she destroyed several hundred Lightning pearls, the vast amount of Lightning Attribute Heavenly Energy had been released back into the atmosphere.\\n\\n Thus far, Shangguan Xue’er had only showed her swordsmanship twice. The first time was the simple piercing strike at the start of the fight, a simple and seemingly basic move that was actually so boundlessly heavy. As for the second strike, it was a countless stream of fine attacks.\\n\\n With just two mere attacks, Zhou Weiqing, who had always thought of himself as invincible amongst any equal stage enemies, was left drenched in cold sweat. The only thing in his mind was - he had actually been intimate with such a beauty, was this luck?!\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er would not change her actions just because of Zhou Weiqing’s psychological changes. The Boundless Infinitum Sword swirled around in the air, white light shining brightly. Abruptly, the Boundless Infinitum Sword seemed to have a strange suction force, and the thick Lightning Attribute Heavenly Energy was drawn into it, turning the blade of the sword into a purplish blue.\\n\\n A step forward, a forward pierce. All of Shangguan Xue’er’s actions seemed so basic, yet terrifyingly powerful. If Zhou Weiqing had to describe that attack, he would say it was simple, yet resplendent.\\n\\n Indeed, simple but resplendent, and more so, he found he was unable to dodge it. This sword was not just with the powerful sword intent, but filled with all of the Lightning Attribute Heavenly Energy that Zhou Weiqing had summoned up earlier!\\n\\n A path that brought the basics to the extreme. This was the core of Shangguan Xue’er’s sword mastery. She did not have any Stored Skills, everything used on the single sword, and with it she could destroy everything.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing was left with no other choice, and the only thing he could do was to lift up the ‘crying-face hammer’ in his hands to block the incoming blow\\n\\n *BOOOM*\\n\\n An explosion that seemed to almost shake the world, and Zhou Weiqing’s body was blown back instantly.\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er’s body also flew back, the Boundless Infinitum Sword in her hands trembling once more. It was not that she did not want to press the advantage and follow up on the attack, but she was just unable to do so. The strength behind those Legendary Hammers were just too terrifying. Though she had been able to knock Zhou Weiqing back with her sword intent and the explosive power of the lightning elements, she was still unable to fully dissipate the power from those hammers.\\n\\n At the same time, the defensive capabilities of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation was just too disgusting. Although Zhou Weiqing had been sent flying back, he was actually totally unharmed. It was just that this was the first time he had ever experienced a foe like Shangguan Xue’er, as such, caught by surprise and off balance, he had not been unable to react properly to such unfamiliar techniques. It was somewhat like how the Lion King Gu Site had felt when facing him indeed!\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing did not rush into releasing other Skills, instead taking a stance with his hammers. He took a deep breath, trying to clear his mind and calm down.\\n\\n Shangguan Xue’er’s power had far surpassed all of his expectations. Only if he calmed down, cleared his mind and focused with all his might could he stand a chance at all.\\n\\n The tip of her feet touching the ground lightly, Shangguan Xue’er flew up into the air once more. As her body rose into the air, the sides of her shoulder pauldrons actually extended. Although they were not actually wings that could beat and fly like Zhou Weiqing had after entering his Dragon-Tiger Transformation, those extensions enabled her to glide in midair. Her movements quick like lightning, the sword in hand warped into thousands of different strikes from all directions, slashing and piercing down towards Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Clearly, Shangguan Xue’er knew that she could never gain any advantage by clashing directly. The pure physical strength behind the hammers were more than enough to close any gap from Heavenly Energy, even able to suppress a portion of her sword intent. As such, she switched to using her techniques, overwhelming him with her fine swordsmanship.\\n\\n In terms of fine technique, even ten of Zhou Weiqing was no match for a single Shangguan Xue’er. The pure strength behind his hammers might be much more terrifying, but in terms of speed and agility, how could they compare with her sword?\\n\\n Of course, Zhou Weiqing still had his own advantages. More so, he had always been a person who was extremely adaptable and able to use any advantage in the best possible way.\\n\\n Once again, an almost exact replica of the previous scene came into play, as several hundred Lightning pearls were unleashed from Zhou Weiqing’s hammers. To any Heavenly Jewel Master, using his Heavenly Energy so generously like that was pretty inconceivable. Yet, to Zhou Weiqing, it was no big deal with his insane regeneration. Perhaps in that instant, he could not regenerate all the Heavenly Energy back, but his terrifying regeneration was a constant effect, and he was not using his Skills all the time. As such, Zhou Weiqing was not worried that he might run out of energy at all, especially since he was using his Lightning Attribute, not the Darkness, Spatial, Time or Demonic Attributes which were even more costly. For those, he would still have to take energy into account before unleashing too many Skills.\\n\\n It was not that Zhou Weiqing had not thought of switching to other Attributes as his main offensive force, but Long Shiya had told him. In terms of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, at least before his cultivation level reached the Heavenly King Stage and beyond, it would be best for him to focus on one and train in it, and it would be far superior to trying to practice every single Attribute. After all, such training and usage of power all had their similarities, and once he had mastered a single Attribute to the extreme, when his cultivation level reached a certain level in the future, it would be easy to transfer that knowledge to using the other attributes as well. The reverse would actually be slower and detrimental to his overall growth. Furthermore, one of Zhou Weiqing’s strongest future power would be the widespread use of his Dark Demon God Lightning, akin to how the Dark Demon God Tiger had used it in his vision. Currently, using his Lightning Attribute as his main offensive tool in the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was a suitable start for him indeed.\\n\\n Another several hundred Lightning pearls against Shangguan Xue’er’s terrifying swordplay. Would the result be the same, with the pearls being destroyed, and their energy used by Shangguan Xue’er? The answer was a definite no.\\n\\n With the fine control over the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation towards the Lightning pearls, would Zhou Weiqing really make a similar mistake twice?\\n\\n Just as the rain of light from Shangguan Xue’er’s sword was about to strike the sea of Lightning pearls once more, there was a strange energy fluctuation from the pearls. At the same time, a layer of grey light sprang into existence around Zhou Weiqing’s body.\\n\\n *Boom**Boom**Boom**Boom**Boom* A series of small explosions that seemed infinite, combining into one massive major soundwave. In the seemingly small energy wave reverberation, the massive amount of Lightning pearls exploded in a series of chain reactions.\\n\\n Since you are able to disable them and prevent my Lightning pearls from exploding, I’ll just set them off before you do so! That was Zhou Weiqing’s current action. He controlled the energy reverberations of the Lightning pearls and caused them to explode as he willed. The terrifying explosion was the pushed outwards with the Ward of the Demon God he had summoned, causing the external force of the explosion to be magnified. These two Skills might seem independent, but they had a surprising synergy indeed. Besides Blink, the Ward of the Demon God was the second Stored Skill that Zhou Weiqing had imbued into his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation this time.\\n\\n As the Lightning pearls exploded, Zhou Weiqing ignored the sudden massive drain on his Heavenly Energy. At the same time, a purple-red light appeared above his head, forming a faint illusory figure… It was the Demonic Dragon Lady!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-22-chapter-184-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
