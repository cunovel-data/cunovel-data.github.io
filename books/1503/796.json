{"id":51970,"no":796,"title":"Chapter 270: Creation vs Destruction (3)","content":"The black hole in the skies dividing slowly shrank, but when it finally vanished, the Blood Red Hell powerhouses were suddenly surprised to see that the six coloured lights of Long Shiya’s had disappeared as his injuries were critical, but they were replaced by another set of coloured lights. The disappearance of the black hole did not take away the darkness, only revealing the specks of star light that had been previously covered by the black hole. Day seemed to have turned into night totally, the dazzling starlight in the skies forming a spinning spiral shaped cloud. The cloud of light seemed to give forth a gentle energy reverberation, and as the star light shone down, the Destruction Barrier of the Blood Red Hell was somehow unable to maintain its position in the skies. Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Saint Energy was considered the purest power of creation. Creation and Destruction were antonyms, naturally opposing. However, even so they would only be able to restrict each other if they were equal. The Blood Red Hell powerhouses did have the Destruction Attribute, but it was only a small portion of their energies, added on to their original Attributes, and was rather impure. As for Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy, it was the purest possible, and was clearly not on the same level. By activating the Astral Cloud, it also meant that Zhou Weiqing was directly linked to it. Leaving aside the strength and power of the energies, just the aura pressure of the Astral Saint Energy alone was enough to suppress the Destruction Attribute energies. Without the fusing and overlaying stacking capabilities of the Destruction Attribute energies, it would be impossible for the Blood Red Hell powerhouses to activate attacks that were fused together so perfectly. With just his attribute aura, Zhou Weiqing had caused these Blood Red Hell powerhouses to lose their greatest strength. The Blood Red Hell First and Third Grand Elder were stunned. At this point, they finally looked at Zhou Weiqing in the distance. The Astral Cloud swirled, lighting up around Zhou Weiqing’s chest. His entire person hovered high up in the skies, the Second Grand Elder still held in his right hand, though his body hung limply there, without any signs of life. It was as if Zhou Weiqing could not see the powerful enemies in front of him. Currently, he seemed to have entered a state of profound mysteries and understanding, his face calm and expressionless like nothing could bother him. Under the faint glow of the astral star light, his entire look became that of a king surveying his domain. The aura of the Astral Saint Energy was not particularly strong, but the faint energy reverberations seemed to mute all of the attributes of those present, enemy and allies alike. More importantly, they were no longer able to connect to the atmospheric energies around them. In their eyes, it was as if Zhou Weiqing had become one with the heavens. Wu Yunyue’s eyes widened. His appraisal of Zhou Weiqing had already been extremely high, no matter in terms of intelligence, cunning or just strength, this youth was definitely top in the world. However, at this point, he realised that his judgement of Zhou Weiqing was still far from reality. The aura that he was giving off now was already far beyond his recognition. How could this be possible?! What kind of energy was that! Both sides were totally stunned. On the side of the Blood Red Hell, the First Grand Elder could clearly sense the Astral energies in the skies, and he dared not make a move easily. The rage from the deaths of the Second and Fourth Elder cooled slightly as he calmed down. As the saying goes, if things seem strange, something might be going wrong. Their greatest advantage had just been suppressed, and let alone facing off against Zhou Weiqing, even the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and Demonic Emperor in front of them would not be so easily defeated. All of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses could clearly sense that the Destruction Attribute within their bodies were totally suppressed, and they could not unleash it properly. Ever since they had gained access to this powerful attribute, this was the first time this had happened. The Destruction Attribute actually seemed to be afraid of the Astral energies! This news was just too important to the Blood Red Hell. The existence of a person like Zhou Weiqing was undoubtedly an immense threat to the entire Blood Red Hell and their future. At this point, both the First and Third Grand Elders were considering if they should dispatch someone to send news back to the Blood Red Hell at once. The reason why the Blood Red Hell had risen so swiftly and actually dared to contest the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was because of this Destruction Attribute! If the power of the Destruction Attribute could be suppressed and limited, the affect it would have on the entire Blood Red Hell’s power was not insignificant. Having accumulated strength for so many years to unleash their full power at this time, if they were to fail now, then the Blood Red Hell would be doomed. Zhou Weiqing hovered in midair. The plan had been constructed by him, and everything was naturally still in his grasp. Killing the Fourth and Second Grand Elder, having his Master and the Demonic Emperor block the enemy’s combined attack… all of this was to give him the time to activate and connect with the Astral Cloud. This was only the second time Zhou Weiqing had actually used this ability in battle. Although the power of the Astral Cloud was immense, being Zhou Weiqing’s current strongest ace; in truth the entire process was long and he could not be interrupted during the whole thing, otherwise it would fail. Alas, the Blood Red Hell powerhouses suffered the major disadvantage in that they did not know Zhou Weiqing at all. When the black hole had formed after the clash between both sides, it had also successfully concealed the energy reverberations of Zhou Weiqing activating and summoning the Astral Cloud. All of those reasons combined were required for his success. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing had Devoured a Heavenly King and a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse one after the other, and as he swiftly transformed it to his own Saint Energy, it also allowed him to summon the Astral Cloud at a much faster speed than the previous time. Eight beams of golden light came crashing down from the heavens at Zhou Weiqing’s call. They simultaneously landed upon Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue, and the six Heavenly Kings of the Heavenly Demon Sect. The eight of them simultaneously felt an enormous amount of energy that was overflowing to the extreme, while lacking any elemental Attribute, enter their bodies. This power was simply too pure, and its greatest advantage lay in the fact that it was also very gentle, allowing them to absorb it directly. This pure power also contained a unique energy reverberation. When it circulated through their bodies, their wounds were all healed considerably. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing used a stance with his right hand. Dense light suddenly exploded in midair and then flew straight into his hand, while the Second Elder in Zhou Weiqing’s other hand also vanished into a cloud of light. These two clouds of light were actually the Heavenly Core Nuclei of the Second and Fourth Grand Elders. This were the Heavenly Core Nuclei of Heavenly Emperors! In the next instant, two rays of gold light soared into the skies, directly headed for the Astral Cloud. In the air, both Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue did not hesitate any longer, charging towards the Blood Red Hell powerhouses with full power. With the support of Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Saint Energy, not only were their wounds recovered, their greatly expended Heavenly Energy had now been recovered to a large degree. It had to be known that after Zhou Weiqing activated and summoned the Astral Cloud, he could be considered the god and ruler of this patch of the world. Under such a circumstance, no one else could even dream of drawing the atmospheric energies here to replenish themselves without his permission. In contrast, the Heavenly Bow Empire powerhouses had his Astral Saint Energy to replenish their powers, and in terms of energy levels they undoubtedly now had an advantage. Of course, even though they were not able to activate the atmospheric energies for their attacks, these Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Emperors were still extremely powerful. In that instant, another large battle exploded into action. Right at this moment, two rays of gold light descended from the skies, the brilliant gold making it seem as if there were two sky pillars joining the heaven and earth, shining directly on Zhou Weiqing one after the other. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body turned a brilliant gold, countless star light welling into his body from the gold light. Zhou Weiqing brandished his left hand once more. The Heavenly King Tianlei’s Heavenly Core Nucleus appeared in the air before him. Although at this point Zhou Weiqing did not really place much importance on the feedback power of a Heavenly King Core Nucleus, even a fly was still meat, and the energies that consolidated a Heavenly Core Nucleus was not bad at all. As the saying goes, many a little makes a mickle. To raise one’s cultivation in a battlefield was definitely something that was avoided for Heavenly Jewel Masters, as one would be at their frailest during the process of leveling up. However, Zhou Weiqing was a totally different case. In the first place, his abilities were extremely unique. At this current moment, he had full control of the world around. Let alone the Blood Red Hell powerhouses would be hard pressed to send someone against him from the main fight; even if they could manage to get someone to attack him, it would not be easy to affect him at all. At this level of fighting, Zong Stage powerhouses were totally useless. As such, although the Blood Red Hell side still had several of these Heavenly Jewel Masters, they dared not enter the fight. The side energy reverberations and repercussions from the clash between Heavenly Emperors would be enough to destroy them if they got too close. The remaining strongest powers of the Blood Red Hell were the two Heavenly Emperor Grand Elders, as well as the seven Heavenly Kings. If not for the Astral Cloud in the skies, with their fusion Destruction Attribute energies, they would definitely be able to beat the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and Demonic Emperor’s side easily. Alas, the current situation had been reversed. Without the Destruction Attribute, they could only fight individually. On Long Shiya’s side, they also had two Heavenly Emperors and six Heavenly Kings. Although they had one less Heavenly King, do not forget that the Heavenly Demon Sect had always been known for their single combat prowess, usually being stronger than those of the same level. The six Heavenly Kings also hated the Blood Red Hell powerhouses so much, and even though they were fighting six against seven, they seemed to be slightly on the advantage. Sweat began to bead on the First and Third Grand Elder’s foreheads. Currently, they will still able to hold their own for now, as Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue were after all injured and unable to unleash their greatest powers. However, do not forget that there was still the existence of Zhou Weiqing up in the skies. At this point, Zhou Weiqing had not started attacking them, but that did not mean he would hold back forever! With such a powerhouse hovering in the skies above them, the pressure it brought to the Blood Red Hell powerhouses could be imagined. The only thing that the First and Third Grand Elders were praying for was that Zhou Weiqing could not maintain the Astral Cloud in the skies for too long. As long as this pressure and suppression on their Destruction Attributes vanished, they might even have the chance of reversing the situation and winning once more. Alas, it did not take long for those hopes to be dashed. The two golden glows in the sky did not actually last for a long time. As the golden glow slowly vanished, the original faint gold color that Zhou Weiqing\u0027s body had become grew stronger and overbearing, now turning into bright brilliant gold. The Astral Saint Energy surrounding his body had obviously become denser. By using Astral Feedback from the Heavenly Nucleus Cores of the two Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperors, Zhou Weiqing had actually upgraded his cultivation base to the Maximum Level Heavenly King stage in this short period of time.
