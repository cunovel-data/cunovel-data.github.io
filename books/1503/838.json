{"id":52012,"no":838,"title":"Chapter 285 - Luring Ink With Saint Energy, Consolidating In The Void (2)","content":"The most shocking thing happened immediately after. The five-meter Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes. The moment he opened his eyes, his entire being seemed to have come to life - it no longer looked like a body of energy. Instead, it looked more like the enlarged version of Zhou Weiqing, as though Zhou Weiqing’s actual body had grown. Even the look in its eyes looked exactly the same as Zhou Weiqing’s earlier. There was absolutely no change. Every single person present was entirely taken aback by what Zhou Weiqing did and stood there dumbfounded. They were even numbed by the sight of it. They absolutely had no idea how Zhou Weiqing executed it - they could only vaguely sense that Zhou Weiqing did it all to enhance his actual self, making himself stronger. Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya could clearly notice that after Zhou Weiqing had transformed himself into the five-meter-tall figure, he was one with the Astral Celestial Territory in the sky at this moment. What was even scarier was that the aura that he was emitting was not at the level of a Heavenly Emperor - it had advanced into the Heavenly God realm. Just like how Zhou Weiqing relied on the Demonic Transformation to enhance himself back then, he was using the Astral Celestial Territory to temporarily increase his cultivation base to the Heavenly God Stage at this moment. The changes were firstly manifested on the jade dragon that was bound within the Astral Celestial Territory - it became more exhausted. The golden light that was trapping it clearly became stronger. It even started emitting a whitish golden luster. The bright golden shade emitted by Zhou Weiqing’s five-meter-tall figure had also transformed to a whitish golden shade. Clearly, the color of his Saint Energy would become whitish gold when he advanced to the Heavenly God Stage. Taking a deep breath, the blueprint before Zhou Weiqing had vanished. It rolled up before entering his body. Moments ago, Zhou Weiqing had used all his strength to activate his will and imprinted the contents of it onto his brain. This was not to say that he had comprehended the secrets within the blueprint, but instead, he had fully memorized it, and will never forget it. Based on his current age, as well as his understanding of Consolidating Equipment Masters, it was impossible for him to fully comprehend it - at least within a short period of time. However, this did not affect his crafting process, particularly under such a circumstance, where he possessed such a massive power. In order to create the eleventh piece of a Legendary Set, one had to at least be a Heavenly Emperor. The higher the cultivation base, the easier the process would be. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing possessed a heaven-defying skill, Time Reversal, that was of high importance to Consolidating Equipment Masters, to guarantee his success. Luring ink with Saint Energy, consolidating in the void. Those words were clearly imprinted in Zhou Weiqing’s mind. At this moment, he had completely entered a different kind of state. If one were to describe Duan Tianlang as a lofty mountain when he was creating the Consolidating Ink earlier, Zhou Weiqing could be described as a cloud in the sky at this moment - an imaginary yet supreme cloud that surpassed all. Terrifying energy ripples circulated the air. No one was able to sense Zhou Weiqing’s presence any longer. If they were to close their eyes, they would only be able to sense the absence of energy, attributes and elements, as well as the presence of the third-party jade dragon. On the other hand, Zhou Weiqing was akin to nothingness within the surroundings. “Senior Uncle, don’t worry. I will not disappoint you.” Zhou Weiqing said to himself. He slowly opened his mouth and took a deep breath. Immediately, countless starlight scattered throughout the sky. In that moment, it seemed as though the surroundings had completely become a bright astral body that fell from the sky with indistinct radiance. The extremely dense Saint Energy ripples caused every single cultivator present, be it Heavenly Kings or Emperors, to turn pale from shock, retreating in panic. The people who had received Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy were in a better position - they did not experience it as strongly as the ones who had not. The latter group felt an incomparable repulsion force. The repulsive aura caused them to flee far away instinctively, or else it felt as though they would be completely torn apart by that terrifying energy. That was Saint Energy, which was also the strongest power that Zhou Weiqing currently possessed. Astral Subsidence, one of the strongest abilities of the Astral Celestial Territory. It was also something that Zhou Weiqing comprehended. Ever since the emergence of Heavenly Jewel Masters, Zhou Weiqing was the first person to comprehend the Astral Celestial Territory. Hence, there was nobody he could learn from or consult. He could only fumble around, doing trial and error, when cultivating, in order to progressively learn more about the wonders of the Astral Celestial Territory. The higher his cultivation base was, the more he felt that the almost boundlessness of the Astral Celestial Territory, particularly the actual Creation Energy within it, had been constantly increasing his cultivation base. It was also the best driving force. At this moment, he was using this feeling to fully use the Astral Celestial Territory’s Astral Subsidence via that feeling, increasing his Saint Energy, as well as the power within the Astral Celestial Territory, to their highest potential. A huge Astral vortex started spiraling at a low altitude. As such, tt was definitely not possible for it to be an actual nebula. It was also completely condensed using the Saint Energy that was being drawn by Zhou Weiqing’s formidable power. Even so, the frightening nebula had started spiraling almost immediately. The dense Saint Energy ripples had caused the entire Heavenly Bow Empire below to be filled with a suffocating Saint Energy aura. When a Heavenly Jewel Master was faced with such a terrifying Saint Energy aura, the only thing he could do was to completely stop resisting and worship it, pledging allegiance to the Saint Energy. That was the only way one could prevent being rejected by the Saint Energy. The higher the cultivation base of the Heavenly Jewel Master, the more affected he would be. On the other hand, an ordinary human being would receive great benefits from the dense Saint Energy instead. They would only be able to feel that the air seemed to have become viscous. Every breath they took felt extremely invigorating. Such a feeling was hard to be described by words alone, but within such a short period of time, they felt mentally refreshed, as though they became a few years younger. The greatest beneficiary of all were the unborn infants in the wombs of the pregnant ladies within the Heavenly Bow Empire. As they possessed congenital qi, it was the easiest for them to accept energy sources such as Saint Energy. Their mothers absorbed the Saint Energy, and channeled it into their bodies after. Regardless of their gifts or natural endowments, these unborn children had the potential to become Heavenly Jewel Masters in the future, as a result of absorbing the dense Saint Energy. That would be sometime in the future. It had never occured to Zhou Weiqing that the consolidation process would be a good thing for the Heavenly Bow Empire. It had also established the powerful foundation of the Heavenly Bow Empire within the Boundless Mainland. After the appearance of the terrifying Saint Energy ripples, the jade dragon cowered in fear. Admittedly, it possessed all attributes and had already reached the Heavenly God Stage. However, it was a pity that it was after all not a living body, but a condensation of several energies. With only basic instincts, it had no chance against Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Celestial Territory. Unlike Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya who had his own Celestial Territory, the Astral Celestial Territory placed much more restrictions on it compared to the others. Furthermore, it had absolutely no way of resisting Zhou Weiqing’s overwhelming power. Hence, it could only be like a lamb that was waiting to be slaughtered. Following the Astral Subsidence, the violent spiraling waves of Nebula Saint Energy was suppressing it further, making it more difficult for it to fight back. In the face of Zhou Weiqing’s Nebula Saint Energy, its massive body gradually condensed together and slowly compressed. The emerald green light became stronger and stronger. However, its body became smaller and smaller. Slowly, it shrank to about eighty meters from one hundred meters. Just like before, the five-meter-tall Zhou Weiqing was suspended in the air. At this moment, he was the core of heaven and earth, the center of which the nebula was orbiting around. As far as the eye can see, everything was in his grasp. From transforming into a body of energy to Astral Subsidence, Zhou Weiqing had spent almost an hour. If it was a battlefield, his enemy would definitely not give him that much time to condense the energy. However, Zhou Weiqing, who had completed Astral Subsidence, would render any Heavenly God’s Celestial Territory useless within the sphere of Astral Subsidence. That was to say that even if he were to face several Heavenly Gods at the same time, he might not necessarily lose. This was his territory, his Celestial Territory. Even if Long Shiya or Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue Aotian were to evaluate, it was not surprising if they called it the number one Celestial Territory in the world. Zhou Weiqing gradually raised his right hand and beckoned to the jade dragon. At the same time, the Nebula Saint Energy that was orbiting his body suddenly dispersed, creating a space that was approximately one hundred meters in diameter. The space was entirely black - a pure shade of black, without any energy. It was, however not a space crack. It was so pure that it had not a single trace of impurity. A ray of emerald green light was emitted from the jade dragon’s trembling body and directly entered the one hundred meter wide pure black space. Zhou Weiqing’s hand movements were very quick. The emerald green light started moving within the black space, leaving behind emerald green marks. What was even more strange was that on the other side of the emerald green light, it was still connected to the jade dragon’s body - it was not broken off. Luring the dragon into the scroll. Indeed, this was what Duan Tianlang meant. Zhou Weiqing’s eyes took in and emitted radiant light, his right hand continuously waved. Consolidating in the void, luring the dragon into the scroll - that was the method to create the final piece of the Legendary Set. Every spectator was fully focusing their attention on watching a strange sight as such. It was a very rare sight that probably happened once in a hundred years, and yet it was currently happening in the skies above Heavenly Bow City! The ordinary folks considered it to be an amazing skill, but the Heavenly Jewel Masters considered it to be a miracle.
