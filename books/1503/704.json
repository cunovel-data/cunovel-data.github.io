(2)","content":"It seemed like Zhou Weiqing did not notice the ambusher behind him and even looked apprehensive regarding the two frontal attacks, so much so that he actually took a few steps back. At this point, he could see the smug expression on Sang De’s face. Alas, how could they be more gifted at scheming than Zhou Little Fatty?\n Sang De and his allies were ecstatic at the sight, and in their excitement, their attacks became even stronger and faster as they charged towards Zhou Weiqing. In that moment, Weiqing acted as if he was flustered as he swung his right hand insectival in the air and stomped his right foot on the ground as if he had lost his balance.\n A strange scene occurred, so swiftly that even that Master Er Chun couldn’t react in time.\n “Pluff! Pluff!” With two quiet sounds, inside a dazzling silver light, Sang De and his ally suddenly struck each other. Their body actually split in halves. The top half was frozen; there was still a gloating and ferocious expression since they were certain of victory. Their bottom half was still lunging forward despite this separation.\n Blood and innards all gushed out.\n Sang De felt this Weiqing person ahead becoming larger and larger. Moreover, his own body felt strange as if something was leaving it. He instinctively looked down before shouting with a miserable, inhuman scream that echoed across the sky.\n It was even worse for the ambusher from the back. He was slithering on the ground but Weiqing’s right stomp emitted an extremely terrifying force. This shockwave blasted through the ground all the way to his body. The reverberation shattered all of his bones and inner organs. With blood gushing out, the guy couldn’t be any deader.\n An instant kill! Just one second earlier, the other three had the upper-hand but now, they have been slaughtered by Weiqing in just a moment in such a terrible manner of death.\n Both the platform and the spectators were completely speechless. City Lord Sang Tan seemed to be held by the throat as he couldn’t utter a single sound. Er Chun was astounded before this scene as well.\n “Sigh! Why did this happen? Why can’t the three of you withstand a single blow? Master Er Chun, you should have realized that they couldn’t handle it, why didn’t you stop me!” Weiqing cried out in shock.\n Shangguan Bing’er in the audience initially frowned after seeing this bloody scene on the stage. However, she almost burst out in laughter after seeing Weiqing’s near flawless acting. This scoundrel...\n Weiqing didn’t come here to start trouble but Sang De’s perverted eyes and Er Chun’s nefarious act have enraged him. He was a person who never took things lying down. Thus, when these people schemed against him, it would be strange if it ended well for them. Moreover, he had other backup plans ready as well.\n “You… you have actually killed them?” Er Chun reacted to Weiqing’s scream while the crowd was in a clamor under the stage.\n Weiqing put on an innocent and aghast expression as he replied, “I didn’t know that it would end like this? Sir, didn’t you tell us to go all out? With your cultivation, you should have been able to stop me, right!?” Despite being quite vague, he dumped all the responsibility back on Er Chun.\n On the main platform, Sang Tan struggled to finally breathe but he still couldn’t speak. In all of these years, he has given Sang De all of the resources he had embezzled from W’Batu City just so that his son could enter the XuanTian Palace. Alas, he didn’t expect that this guarantee would actually develop in this sudden manner. His only son was dead now; his eyes turned bloodshot even as he sat on the platform, glaring at Weiqing on the stage.\n “Bastard, you came here, inciting trouble on purpose! This is the greatest provocation against our palace. Men, capture him!” Er Chun was also livid. Even though he had a pivotal position at W’Batu, the three dead brats were not commoners either. Moreover, he had already accepted the bribes.\n With that, he didn’t care for anything else and instantly unleashed a palm strike at Weiqing. The temperature on the stage suddenly dropped. One could see snowflakes condensing in the air.\n Weiqing didn’t bother dodging this coming attack while sneering: “Very good indeed, XuanTian Palace, how disappointing…”\n A thick, yellow glow suddenly lit up with a loud explosion. Weiqing stood motionlessly without even lifting a single finger yet he managed to dispel Er Chun’s attack. Meanwhile, the Dual Legendary Hammers appeared in his hands.\n “Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura?!” Er Chun was a knowledgeable man as he exclaimed in shock. His attack also halted instantly.\n A God Tier Consolidated Equipment was extremely rare in both the Boundless Mainland and XuanTian Continent. Weiqing has seen quite a few from the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, but do not forget, the ones who had the God Tier Consolidated Equipment were all incredible talents painstakingly groomed from the Five Great Saint Lands. For common Heavenly Jewel Masters, even an ordinary equipment was hard to come by, let alone those of this level.\n Er Chun’s rage immediately paused as he stopped from any thoughts of revenge after suddenly seeing the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, especially considering Zhou Weiqing’s young age. In the XuanTian Continent, those who could have God Tier Consolidated Equipment must have an incredible background. Even as a representative of the XuanTian Palace to watch over this city, he still didn’t have any Consolidated Equipment of this level.\n Weiqing slightly pursed his lips with disdain, “You know about Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura? Then do you also know the Legacy of Strength?” He was the best at duping people. In the past, he once duped a Heavenly King powerhouse until he didn’t dare to fight. At that time, Zhou Weiqing’s strength couldn’t even begin to compare to his power now. Now that he was so much more powerful, he was far more confident and easygoing, and his natural trickery came into play once more. After all, it would be extremely strange if someone on the XuanTian Continent would be able to recognize the Legacy Of Strength.\n Er Chun instinctively shook his head in confusion.\n Weiqing hummed with contempt, “You don’t even know the Legacy of Strength. It looks like our branch of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters have been forgotten by the world.”\n Before anything else, when Weiqing uttered the words “God Tier Masters”, even the downtrodden Sang Tan who wanted nothing more than to eat his flesh as revenge for killing his son suddenly calmed down after realizing something.\n “What did you say? You are a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master?” Er Chun’s eyes were full of disbelief. As an inner-disciple of the XuanTian Palace, the top sect of the nine continents, he knew quite a bit about these God Tier Masters. At the very least, he knew that they must be at least a low-level Heavenly King. This youth ahead was only at the fifth jewel cultivation level yet he called himself a God Tier Master with such forceful conviction.\n “You don’t believe me?” Weiqing posed with both hands behind his back. He truly looked like a transcending cultivator under this acting skill.\n “I descended this time in order to befriend the XuanTian Palace in order to build a mutually beneficial relationship. Who would have thought that I would see these evil deeds from all of you right away. I’m too lazy to explain anything. Watch, the truth is better than any words.”\n Having said that, he swung his left sleeve. A Consolidated Paper made from the softest and best quality material flew out. Just this thing alone was more than one hundred gold.\n Gold was also the common denomination at Xuantian. However, the carved diagrams on their money was different from the Boundless Mainland.\n This soft sheet of paper hovered before Weiqing while he acted quite dignified with his left hand behind his back. The reputation of a God Tier Master was too much. All eyes were on him at this moment.\n Suddenly, no one saw how he did it. A silver glow suddenly flashed while the paper slightly trembled in the sky. One second later, this silver glow became dazzling. Weiqing swung his hand and this paper flew then fell before another Heavenly Jewel Master below the stage who came to participate in this selection.\n He instinctively accepted the scroll. At the same time, his eyes widened as he shouted, “This, this is a Consolidated Scroll! Oh Lord! A Consolidated Scroll of the Great Master level.”\n Just like Weiqing has said, the truth is better than any words. There was no need for him to say anything when reality was unravelling before everyone’s eyes.\n This master lifted his head and crazily stared at Weiqing. Yes! He was a Heavenly Jewel Master. When someone like him face a Consolidated Master, this would undoubtedly be their emotions. Moreover, this wasn’t an ordinary Consolidated Master. This was a God Tier Master, a near legend in XuanTian!\n At the very least, this particular Heavenly Jewel Master didn’t question Weiqing’s identity at all. He casually threw out a Consolidated Scroll of the Grand Master level. Who else could do this outside of God Tier Masters?\n Weiqing chuckled in response, “This scroll will be yours, just a little gift. However, I respectfully bid every Heavenly Jewel Masters here to be the witness. I spent twenty years immersing myself in the art of creating Consolidated Scrolls. In terms of cultivation, I am no match for Master Er Chun, so if I can’t show up to the Xuantian selection’s competition, I hope everyone will report what you have seen today to the Xuantian Palace. I trust that they will give a fair judgement towards a God Tier Master like me.”\n The Heavenly Jewel Masters in the crowd quickly agreed after hearing this. They were already unhappy about Er Chun. Weiqing, on the other hand, was a God Tier Master. Being recognized by one would mean a straight path paved with gold ahead for any Heavenly Jewel Master! Moreover, the crowd was above the laws. There were more than one hundred masters present, all with great status and background. Even if Er Chun was fierce with City Lord Sang Tan on his side, he still didn’t dare to antagonize so many masters at the same time.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-25-chapter-238-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
