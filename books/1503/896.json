{"id":52070,"no":896,"title":"Chapter 305 - Hero! (3)","content":"The most crucial moment of restoring the seal had finally arrived. Right now, Zhou Weiqing had absolute confidence in succeeding. Under the effects of the formation, he was akin to an enormous Saint Energy core. The purity and denseness of the Saint Energy was shocking even to someone like him. Furthermore, under the influence of his Saint Energy, the seal of the Netherworld’s formation was constantly undergoing minute changes. These changes were positive in nature, as though the formation was constantly trying to perfect itself as the Saint Energy was channeled into it.\\n\\n Throughout the whole process, the power of the formation had also gotten continuously stronger, exerting pressuring over the Lord of the Nether as well.\\n\\n The original Destructive Energy started to tremble violently; the enormous pincers of the Lord of the Nether trembled as a result as well. Gradually, they were pushed back down to where they came from, bit by bit.\\n\\n The seal that was being broken by the pincers, as well as the marks on the seal, gradually merged following the retracting of the pincers. At this moment, the cracks on the other parts of the formation had vanished due to the effects of the Saint Energy. Everything was progressing well.\\n\\n “Bastard! Bastard!” roared the Lord of the Nether in anger. However, regardless of how much he raged, it could not change the fact that the pincers were gradually being pushed back to where they came from.\\n\\n The intense sense of crisis as well as fear continuously appeared within the Lord of the Nether’s will. He could clearly sense that the small cracks that he secretly created on the other areas of the formation had closed up as a result of the Saint Energy channeled by Zhou Weiqing. This signified the fact that what he was most worried about was about to happen.\\n\\n Due to the reopening of the seal’s space, at this moment, as a result of the light curtain, the Lord of the Nether could be clearly seen. His massive body was swaying continuously. Evidently he had released his Destructive Energy at full force in the hopes of grabbing the final opportunity. However, within the seal’s space, all he could sense was the Saint Energy within the Creation aura.\\n\\n Under the effects of the Saint Energy, the injuries suffered by the Sidhe Empress and the Ancient Tree of Life had healed significantly. Saint Energy was evidently the best nourishment for them.\\n\\n “Go back to your Netherworld. May you be suppressed there for eternity.” Zhou Weiqing’s cold voice resounded within the space. He put his palms together before his chest and his powerful will erupted once more. Coupled with the light emitted from his Saint God Core Nucleus, he delivered a powerful blow to the Lord of the Nether and forcefully pushed the pincers a couple of meters downwards.\\n\\n At this moment, Zhou Weiqing and the twelve Divine Beasts, that were supporting the formation with him, were extremely excited. The seal was about to be completed once again right before their eyes - how was it possible for them to keep their cool? They were a lot more familiarized with the formation compared to Zhou Weiqing, naturally, they were able to sense its perfected state upon completion. Furthermore, due to the fact that Zhou Weiqing had constantly transformed their Heavenly Energy into Saint Energy, they were more or less affected to a certain degree as a result, in a good way. The Saint Energy was restoring their bodies and allowed their Heavenly Energy to become smoother, as well as maintaining its unending flow.\\n\\n The Lord of the Nether’s pincers had been pushed back by a third; the remaining parts were also constantly being pushed back at an increasing speed. Since he was constantly on the losing end with Zhou Weiqing constantly gaining an upper hand, he was no longer able to contend against Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy.\\n\\n “Zhou Weiqing, my biggest mistake was my failure to realize that you possess Saint Energy. However, just because of that, do you think that I’m unable to deal with you? Do you think that all of you are able to seal me forever? You are not the Dragon Emperor after all.”\\n\\n On the other side of the light curtain, the Lord of the Nether’s body stopped swaying abruptly. His icy cold voice, that seemed to be coming from the depths of the Netherworld, caused one’s soul to tremble. His pincers seemed to stop resisting the attacks; even the original Destructive Energy between the pincers had been quietly withdrawn, allowing the massive Saint Energy to enveloped the enormous pincers, which caused them to be pushed back at an even more rapid speed.\\n\\n “Lord of the Nether, are you still struggling on your deathbed? You no longer have a chance to make a comeback.” Zhou Weiqing did not let his guard down despite the fact that the Lord of Nether had suddenly given up resisting against his attacks. Instead, he increased the output of his Saint Energy. Furthermore, for some reason he felt a sense of uneasiness, albeit faintly. It did not seem as though the Lord of the Nether said that without any basis.\\n\\n At this very moment, the enormous pincers that were emitting dark green luster suddenly stopped moving. They had stopped moving in the process of being suppressed downwards. Regardless of how much Saint Energy Zhou Weiqing mobilized, they did not budge.\\n\\n What is happening? This is impossible! Zhou Weiqing, as well as the other Divine Beasts, were utterly shocked. Could it be that the Lord of the Nether had received more Destructive Energy from elsewhere? However, he was originally already that powerful. Furthermore, his odds were better than they were earlier on. Why did he not use such a powerful energy earlier, and only waited till this moment?\\n\\n At this moment, streaks of dark green lightning appeared above the enormous pincers. Even the pure Saint Energy that was released via Zhou Weiqing’s Saint God Core Nucleus continuously disintegrated upon contact with the dark green lightning. An extremely terrifying aura was violently released from the pincers, resulting in the Saint Energy from the seal to be pushed back by a dozen meters.\\n\\n The dark green pincers gradually changed colors, turning into a clear shade of black, like a black crystal. The streaks of jet black lightning in the surroundings had become more intense as well.\\n\\n Fortunately, the intimidating black lightning seemed to only be revolving within the immediate surroundings of the Lord of the Nether’s pincers, continuously destroying the Saint Energy that approached them.\\n\\n What kind of energy is this? Zhou Weiqing could not comprehend. Looking at the enormous pincers, he could not help but have a doubtful look in his eyes.\\n\\n “Zhou Weiqing, you should feel proud for being able to push me into such a predicament. So, right now, it’s time for you to die.” The cold voice resounded within the formation. The black lightning around the pincers abruptly inflated. Indistinctly, Zhou Weiqing seemed to have seen cracks appearing on the Lord of the Nether’s enormous pincers.\\n\\n “This is bad - his pincers are about to self-detonate. Weiqing, be careful,” said the Sidhe Empress, whose voice came from a distance away from the formation. However, this time, it was different from when she helped Zhou Weiqing resist against the Lord of the Nether’s attack. The formation had already been restored. Without the approval of Zhou Weiqing, who was the core of the formation, she was unable to charge into the formation, despite her cultivation base.\\n\\n Self-detonation? The moment Zhou Weiqing heard that word clearly, an extremely violent explosion sound was erupted from underneath him - which was the most central location of the seal’s formation.\\n\\n That did not merely cause energy fluctuations - even souls trembled violently. The violent explosion sounds erupted, accompanying the emergence of a clear black halo.\\n\\n In an instant, Zhou Weiqing’s state of mind was shaken up. It seemed as though the entire formation was about to crumble in the blink of an eye.\\n\\n However, at this moment, the complicated symbols within the formation, that had already turned into a shade of white-gold, were all lit up. They emitted a dense divine light and powerful Saint Energy was erupting from every single symbol. Even though a massive amount of Saint Energy in the center of the formation had been destroyed by the black light that was spreading, the black halo was forcefully being pushed back within an area, with a 300 meter diameter, and were unable to charge any farther.\\n\\n Originally, the Lord of the Nether’s pincers had already disappeared. A massive black vortex had taken over their place. Evidently, even though they had self-detonated, the Lord of the Nether’s Destructive Energy was not powerful enough to break through the seal’s formation that was almost completed. On the contrary, after the detonation of the pincers, the area on the formation that was originally being broken by the pincers was sealing up at an alarming rate.\\n\\n Even though the Destructive Energy that erupted was powerful, it was ultimately being melted down by the Saint Energy. As long as the seal’s formation was complete, the Lord of the Nether was done for. What he was currently doing was akin to taking poison in an attempt to quench his thirst.\\n\\n However, would the Lord of the Nether do something as pointless as such? Especially when he was on the brink of death?\\n\\n Even though the seal’s formation was not destroyed as a result of the self-detonation, the Saint Energy in the surroundings was forcefully pushed away. After all it was a part of the Lord of the Nether’s body that detonated - the Destructive Energy that was released as a result was definitely massive.\\n\\n Hence, a vacuum was created in the center of the formation, while the black Destructive Energy vortex that was formed from the explosion was condensed. In an instant, it swept directly towards Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er.\\n\\n The size of the vortex was not considered too big. However, the Destructive Energy stored within it was terrifying - it seemed as though it was entirely being condensed by the original Destructive Energy.\\n\\n At this moment, Zhou Weiqing had two options - firstly, he could take Tian’er with him and leave the core of the formation in order to dodge the Destructive Energy vortex. He was the center of the formation, hence he could leave as he wished.\\n\\n However, if that was the case, it could destroy the almost perfected and completed seal’s formation, which was in the midst of closing up. Nobody knew whether or not the Lord of the Nether was able to take the opportunity to break out of the seal, if that were to happen. At this moment, the final breach in the formation down below had not been sealed by the Saint Energy. Once the effects of the formation had disappeared, the possibility of the Lord of the Nether breaking out could be very high. Hence, everything that they did would be in vain.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s second option was to ignore the Lord of the Nether’s attack and attempt to thoroughly seal the formation at full force. However, he would have to bear the brunt of the terrifying fatal attack and even if he survived, he would be severely injured.\\n\\n At this moment, the determined look in the Dragon Emperor’s eyes, when he was channeling his energy to Zhou Weiqing, flashed across Zhou Weiqing’s mind. Zhou Weiqing, who had always been fearful of death for as long as he could remember, made the most resolute choice in his life at this very moment.\\n\\n The first thing that Zhou Weiqing did was to release his Saint Energy. A bout of gentle yet resilient energy erupted from within his body, lifting Tian’er’s body, who was hugging him, and sent it to one side via the manipulation of the Saint Energy in the surroundings.\\n\\n At the same time, his body did not budge at all - he did not even look at the powerful Destructive vortex. Instead, he mobilized the Saint Energy with all his might and channeled it into the seal’s formation, causing the formation to be at its most effective state.\\n\\n “Weiqing……” The Sidhe Empress’ helpless cry echoed from a distance away, outside the formation.\\n\\n At this moment, all the Divine Beasts widened their eyes. However, they were not the core of the formation. Also, they had already released their wills and opened them entirely to Zhou Weiqing. They could only allow Zhou Weiqing to control their actions, and were unable to influence his decision.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-305-3","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
