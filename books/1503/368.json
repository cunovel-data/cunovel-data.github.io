By this time, her opponent had already entered the fighting zone.\n Her opponent was a robust looking youth, full of youthful spirit and vitality, his bulging muscles straining his army uniform, giving him a tough valiant look.\n “Little bro, don’t worry, this Big Bro will go easy on you; after all we are all in the same Regiment.” The youth laughed heartily as he said to Shangguan Fei’er.\n Shangguan Fei’er gave a humph, but did not retort, instead crooking a finger at him and saying: “Come then,.” \n The youth laughed and said: “Ohh, you have an attitude, I like it. Here I come then!” As he said that, he charged forward in a quick step. \n Zhou Weiqing stood at the side of the fighting, watching coolly. With a single look, he could tell that the youth did not have any Heavenly Energy. However, his physique was top notch, his movements crisp, and from the looks of things, his strength was far beyond any ordinary human. This was definitely a well trained, elite soldier.\n Indeed, this youth was clearly a well trained, experienced fighter. In a single charge, he quickly reached Shangguan Fei’er, his left hand feinting a strike towards her face, mainly designed to draw her attention, while his right hand flew out towards her chest. \n Like he said, he did not have the intention to injure Shangguan Fei’er, and his attack was designed to grab hold of ‘him’ and throw ‘him’ out of the zone. \n Seeing that attack, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but close his eyes, lamenting inwardly to himself. Sigh, this brother is screwed. Although he has good intentions, how could he know that this person he was facing was actually a girl. To grab towards a girl’s chest, especially with this girl known as the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace… how could he not be in trouble. \n What cultivation level was Shangguan Fei’er at? Even without her cultivation level, her close combat capabilities were far beyond ordinary; how could she be tricked by such a simple feint? Seeing her opponent grab towards her chest, she was immediately enraged, stepping forward instead of retreating. With a slight dip of her body, she twisted in mid air, her hands striking out. \n The youthful opponent, who had severely underestimated her, suddenly felt both his hands go numb. The next instant, his large body flew up into the air, twirling around before slamming savagely down on the ground with a loud thud. \n There had been a crowd of soldiers watching the fight with interest, and at that instant, they were all stunned. Shangguan Fei’er’s movements were just too fast, and none of them had clearly seen how she had done it. It was as if their two blurred figures had intercrossed before that young fighter had been thrown down. \n Even the two Company Leaders could sense that Shangguan Fei’er had not used Heavenly Energy, totally depending on skilled close combat skills. \n “Impressive fighting skills! Looks like our Seventeenth Regiment has a new valiant warrior!” The Company Leader on the left started clapping. \n Shangguan Fei’er did not even look at her defeated opponent, and she had already returned to Zhou Weiqing’s side. After a while, the young man finally clambered to his feet. Although with his physique, that throw had not injured him at all, it had still taken the breath out of him. More importantly, he had been shocked and surprised by his sudden loss, and did not even know how he had lost, and he quickly walked to the side in shame.\n The Company Leader gave Shangguan Fei’er a big thumbs up, saying: “Very good, I did not expect that little bro has such great skills despite your slender frame. Do you want to go another round? This time, I’ll find someone stronger.” \n Shangguan Fei’er shook her head, the picture of harmless obedience as she said: “I am just here to join my Young Master in the army; as long as I can stay by Young Master’s side, I am satisfied. I am nothing compared to our Young Master, he is truly powerful indeed.” \n Looking at her harmless, honest, obedient look, Zhou Weiqing almost puked out a mouthful of blood. He had always thought that his acting skills were top notch, but he realised that in comparison to Shangguan Fei’er, he was just a mere calefare. Luckily, she was listening to his instructions, otherwise if she acted up, that would be a big problem. \n Zhou Weiqing’s impression of Shangguan Fei’er improved drastically in that moment. At least, no matter what, she was able to keep the big picture in mind. \n “Ohh?” The two Company Leaders immediately turned to Zhou Weiqing, looking at him with great interest. \n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, a honest, simple look on his face as he said: “My family has long fallen, besides this little attendant willing to follow me, we do not have anyone else. That is why I have come to join the army.” \n The Company Leader on the right said with a serious expression: “Alright, no use just talking. Go ahead and show us your power. As long as you have the strength, you will not be neglected or buried in our Seventeenth Regiment.” \n “Very good.” Zhou Weiqing agreed in a straightforward manner, striding directly into the fighting zone. \n When he entered the fighting zone, everyone had the strange feel that this young man was some old experienced soldier. In truth, this was not Zhou Weiqing’s first time in the army. After all, when he had entered the Heavenly Bow Empire army, he had been thirteen, fourteen years old. Although he had not spent much time in the army camp, that had given him a lasting impression, especially since he had been together with Shangguan Bing’er. \n Watching as Zhou Weiqing entered the fighting zone, the two Company Leaders exchanged a look before nodding. They were in charge of this particular beginner’s competition zone, and they were able to arrange the fighting sequence and opponents. \n Another young soldier of about twenty years of age jumped into the center of the fighting zone. His eyes had a stable, solemn quality to them, much more so than the previous opponent of Shangguan Fei’er’s. He stared fixedly at Zhou Weiqing, as if making sure every move he made was under his watch. Clearly, he would not attempt to underestimate his opponent like the previous soldier. \n The Company Leader shouted out: “Begin!” \n Without hesitation, the young soldier charged towards Zhou Weiqing, then abruptly side stepped in a sudden change of direction, circling Zhou Weiqing in an attempt to look for a weak point. \n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “You do not need to go through such troubles, I have many weak points you can exploit. Here!” As he said that, he actually spread his arms wide, leaving himself totally open. \n Seeing that Zhou Weiqing was underestimating and disrespecting him, an angry look crossed the young soldier’s face, and in a flash,he charged towards Zhou Weiqing. His movements were swift, and held a slight undercurrent of Heavenly Energy. Using his elbow, the hardest part of the human body, he struck towards Zhou Weiqing’s chest. \n To the audience’s surprise, Zhou Weiqing did not even attempt to dodge the attack, standing there with his arms spread open, allowing his opponent to strike his chest directly. \n *PENG* A muffled thud as the elbow slammed savagely into Zhou Weiqing’s chest, but it was the young soldier whose expression changed into shock and fear, as he felt like his elbow had slammed into a metal board, the sheer impact and resulting force causing his entire arm to go numb. \n It was only at this point that Zhou Weiqing took action, his spread arms finally closing in, grabbing hold onto the young soldier’s shoulders, easily lifting him up as he pressed down on his clavicle Acupuncture Point, causing his entire body to go numb. \n “You’re not my match. Next?” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing had placed him back down heavily onto the ground. \n In the Duelling Corner, there were at least a dozen or more fights each day. During periods of non combat, the soldiers were given staggering periods of rest days, and most of the soldiers spent their off time here. However, since when had the surrounding audience of soldiers seen a fight like this before? \n The two Company Leaders’ knowledge and vision was naturally stronger than the ordinary soldiers, and they could tell that while this fight seemed ordinary, it was definitely not so. \n They knew very well how strong that young soldier was, with a cultivation level at the first level of Heavenly Energy. Although he was not a Jewel Master, he was definitely stronger than most ordinary people. Furthermore, he had used his elbow in striking, and the force of the blow would have been at least a hundred jin or more, and being struck on the chest area, any person, even with a few levels of Heavenly Energy to protect themselves, would feel the effects. \n For Zhou Weiqing to finish off his opponent so easily, and in such a manner, to the two Company Leaders, there were only two possibilities: One, this Zhou Weiqing was born with unnatural toughness and resilience, able to take hits no ordinary humans could. Two, he was a Jewel Master of decent rank. \n “One more. Old Mo, you go.” \n “Yes sir.” \n A middle aged soldier around forty years old or so jumped out. He was not tall or stout, only about 1.5metres in height, and in front of Zhou Weiqing, he seemed like a little child. He was slim, almost scrawny, but his movements were quick and agile. \n There weren’t too many other rules in the Duelling Corner, and he just greeted Zhou Weiqing with a fist in palm salute [1.kung fu salute?], and in a flash, he had already charged towards Zhou Weiqing. \n Just before he reached Zhou Weiqing, the soldier named Old Mo suddenly jumped to the side swiftly, the tip of his feet striking the ground as he slid behind Zhou Weiqing. With a leap, his hands struck down towards Zhou Weiqing’s neck without hesitation in a nimble, swift motion. \n Alas, he was facing Zhou Weiqing, who did not even look back, instead leaning his body slightly forward, allowing Old Mo’s hands to strike on his neck. Just as his opponent’s palm reached his neck, he grabbed hold of them. With his superior senses, it was easy for him to make such a judgement. \n In the next instant, the scrawny Old Mo had been lifted with a single arm over, dragged over and slammed down onto the ground. At the same time as Old Mo’s body touched the ground, Zhou Weiqing pushed forward with his right leg, tipping him on his buttocks and preventing him from landing too hard, sending him flying out of the zone gently. \n It was clear that he had been lenient, and Old Mo retreated with a red face. \n With two consecutive victories, Zhou Weiqing became the center of attraction. His fighting style was direct, but extremely effective. He did not have any flourishes or showy fight moves, a simple accepting hits from his opponent, grabbing hold of his opponent during that time, and then… the fight was over. Just as simple as that. \n However, at this point, the two Company Leaders were extremely conflicted. It was great to find new talent, but to have a fresh recruit run rampage so easily over the Duelling Corner zone they were in charge off, it made them rather uncomfortable. However, even if they wanted to teach him a lesson, who could they send?!\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-15-chapter-120-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
