{"id":52063,"no":889,"title":"Chapter 303 - The Seal of the Netherworld (2)","content":"Both of them had the same cultivation base, which was the Max Level Heavenly God Stage, and they also mobilized nearly the same amount of Heavenly Energy. Their only difference was the purity of both their attributes, as well as their Heavenly Energy. This was the reason why there was still a huge disparity between Hui Yao and the Dragon Emperor. Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s bodies were being swept away by the dark red light, headed in the direction of the Dragon Emperor’s head. Zhou Weiqing held onto Tian’er’s hand and remained still, allowing the energy to sweep them along. This was because Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that this was the entrance to the seal’s formation. If he wanted to get to the Dragon Emperor’s head on his own, it would be impossible. The Dragon Emperor was right in the middle of the seal of the Netherworld. If one were to approach him by force, he would immediately be attacked by the twelve other Heavenly Beasts, guided by the formation. Very soon, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er got closer to the Dragon Emperor. However, at this time, a sudden loud rumbling sound rang through the air, causing the entire pitch-black space to shake violently. The tremors were violent to the extent that it shattered the Fire Energy released by the Dragon Emperor. All thirteen Heavenly Beasts’ bodies were shaking violently, causing their Heavenly Energy to spurt out in a frenzy, obstructing Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, keeping them on the outside. Furthermore, their energy poured out at an alarming rate in an instant. At this moment, the pitch-black space was completely brightened up. Various kinds of dazzling and peculiar light patterns and symbols flickered with one another in the sky. At this moment, it made Zhou Weiqing feel as though his body was in an extremely viscous sea, and the viscous seawater was the massive Saint Energy. It was to be noted that all thirteen Heavenly Beasts released their Heavenly Energy at the same time. Furthermore, their Heavenly Energy had been enhanced by the formation. One could imagine just how massive the Heavenly Energy was. Even with Zhou Weiqing’s current cultivation base at the Max Level Heavenly God Stage, it was hard for him to move within the viscous liquefied energy. Without a doubt, the change was definitely triggered by the Lord of the Nether in his violent attempt to break the seal once again. Zhou Weiqing had noticed that following the violent attack, a huge light curtain appeared below the thirteen Heavenly Beasts. The light curtain had a diameter of a thousand meters and was in the shade of light red. There were already dozens of cracks on the light shield, and following the violent attack, the cracks had spread out in all directions. It seemed as though it was about to crumble at any moment. The light curtain was transparent. A humongous figure could faintly be seen behind the enormous light curtain. The fella’s body was even slightly bigger than that of the dragon turtle. Due to the fact that there was a layer of red light veil separating them from it, albeit indistinct, its color seemed to be closer to black. As for its physique, Zhou Weiqing was very familiar with it. It was similar to the huge black crab that appeared when Fen Tian was borrowing the Lord of the Nether’s powers earlier on. Without a doubt, the light curtain was the miniature version of the entire seal of the Netherworld. As for the humongous figure on the other side of the light curtain, it was the actual body of the Lord of the Nether. The viscous Heavenly Energy was continuously channeled into the huge symbols that were hovering in the air in an attempt to slow down the the cracks from spreading. At the same time, it also strengthened the entire seal. However, evidently, the Lord of the Nether’s attack was stronger, as the cracks continuously spread out. “Dragon Emperor, do not waste your effort. This time, all of you are unable to stop me. The resentment in the human world has been continuously providing me with energy. You do not have any chance to stop me. Haha, hahahaha. Once I get out, all of you shall die. I will turn all of you into my puppets and let you witness the magnificent feat of me destroying the entire Mainland. I will make the Boundless Mainland a part of the Netherworld. I will engulf everything and create the true Netherworld.” The Lord of the Nether’s voice was still as ambiguous as before. Furthermore, his voice in this realm was different compared to how it was like in the external world. Every word he uttered had caused one’s soul to tremble violently, and stirred up every single person’s emotions. It was as though a large amount of negative emotions was forcefully channeled into each and every one of their minds. “Lord of the Nether, I will not let you succeed. Since I’ve managed to seal you for thousands of years, I will definitely be able to continue doing so.” The Dragon Emperor’s eyes glistened with determination as he continued to release energy. Even though Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er did not successfully get to the Dragon Emperor’s head, with the addition of the new powerhouses Hui Yao and Duo Si, the Heavenly Energy became stabilized and continuously became more powerful. Finally, the spreading of the cracks had slowed down and even seemed like they were sealing up. “Perhaps if you were still in your prime, you might have truly been able to continue to maintain the seal. However, the present you is not able to do it. I’ve prepared a huge gift for you and it’s about time for me to give it to you.” The Lord of the Nether’s voice gradually became more hysterical. Immediately after, on the other side of the light curtain, a strange red halo lit up before the Lord of the Nether. When the red halo first appeared, the Lord of the Nether’s attack had slowed down noticeably and the cracks on the seal were stabilized. Even though it was very difficult to seal the cracks, at the very least the cracks did not continue to spread. Before the Dragon Emperor and the other Heavenly Beasts could relax, Hui Yao and Duo Si let out a mournful roar at the same time. On the other side of the light curtain, the red light image released by the Lord of the Nether gradually became clearer. There were two small inconspicuous figures. However, they took the form of a dragon - the two small dragon figures helplessly paced within a specific area. “Those, those are……” The Dragon Emperor’s massive body trembled violently. “Our children…those are our children! Those are the souls of our children. Return my children to me.” Duo Si cried out sorrowfully, and was about to charge in the direction of the light curtain. Even though she was unable to leave her position due to the influence of the formation, the entire formation became unstable when she moved. “Calm down. We must not affect the seal!” The Dragon Emperor roared loudly. The entire space of the seal shook violently. The Dragon Emperor’s powerful might managed to forcefully suppress the intense fluctuations of Hui Yao and Duo Si’s emotions. Even so, the Heavenly Energy released by Hui Yao and Duo Si was evidently unstable. “Hahahahaha, Dragon Emperor, are you pleased with my huge gift? Your seal is built on the dragon and sidhe’s bloodlines. Now that I possess your bloodline, I’d sure like to see how you’re going to seal me.” As he spoke, the Lord of the Nether, who was in the form of a crab, extended his two huge pincers, each grabbing a small dragon. Under Hui Yao and Duo Si’s cries, the two dragon souls were instantly shattered. An intense black light merged with the light image of the two shattered dragon souls before striking the seal hard. Bam—— The entire space of the seal shattered almost immediately. More than half of the spectacular colors in the surroundings had vanished. The original space had appeared once again. The Heavenly Beasts brought Zhou Weiqing and company along with them and appeared within the huge cave that they first arrived at. The pair of enormous pincers clawed out from the seal’s formation below and forcefully struck the Dragon Emperor’s body, causing his massive body to fly upon impact and crash hard against the roof of the cave, resulting in a loud bang. A large portion of the scales below the Dragon Emperor’s abdomen had shattered; countless black lights had surrounded his body. Blood gushed out in all directions and the Dragon Emperor was spurting out blood from his mouth as well. His entire body was wedged into the roof of the cave. At this moment, the seal’s energy was at its weakest. Even though the seal was still persisting, the huge pincers were clawing about in a frenzy. It seemed as though the entire seal was about to be broken, destroying everything here. And when that happened, the Lord of the Nether was about to enter the human world! “Don’t panic. Let me do it.” In the most dangerous and crucial moment, A loud voice caused all the Heavenly Beasts, who were in despair, to snap out of their thoughts. Immediately after, two white-golden figures flew up into the air and appeared at the Dragon Emperor’s original position. At the same time, a strong emerald green light abruptly appeared and transformed into an enormous emerald green halo that pulled the twelve Heavenly Beasts, who were scattered upon impact earlier, back together, before channeling a massive amount of Life Saint Energy into them. On top of that, at this moment, the entire cave had turned into an emerald green sea. An enormous illusory light image hovered in mid-air below the Dragon Emperor. Even the movement of the Lord of the Nether’s huge pincers had slowed down as a result of its appearance. “This, this is……” Shock, intense happiness and mostly disbelief appeared in the eyes of the Heavenly Beasts. The enormous light image was three hundred meters tall. The vast treetop had covered almost the entire area. The rich Life Saint Energy, as well as the emerald green brilliance, seemed as though it was sculpted from the most beautiful emperor green jade, as they were emitting rich Life aura. Even the dying Dragon Emperor who crashed into the roof of the cave was being pulled back from the brink of death by force after receiving this massive Life Energy. Indeed, it was the Ancient Tree of Life - the Sidhe’s Ancient Tree of Life. It had actually appeared within the cave at this very moment. Even Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s eyes were filled with extreme disbelief, let alone the Heavenly Beasts. This was the Sidhe Empress’ actual trump card. After the evolution of the Ancient Tree of Life, it could begin moving on its own. Ever since Zhou Weiqing had left the Sidhe’s sealed grounds, the Sidhe Empress had began to quietly bring the Ancient tree of Life into the WanShou Empire. After several months, they had finally approached the Heavenly Snow Mountain. She had continuously engaged in a secret technique to conceal the Ancient Tree of Life’s aura. No one else had discovered its presence - only the Sidhe elders knew about it. This was the Sidhe Empress’ true hidden trump card. She had waited till this very moment to use it. Originally, when Zhou Weiqing was fighting against Fen Tian, the Sidhe Empress had nearly summoned the Ancient Tree of Life. However, since Zhou Weiqing had used the powerful Time Attribute technique to kill Fen Tian, it allowed this hidden trump to be used at the most crucial moment.
