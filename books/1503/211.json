Amongst all the people in the field, perhaps anyone else might underestimate Zhou Weiqing, but he was the last person who would. Although in terms of overall power Lin TianAo was higher than Zhou Weiqing, and he knew Zhou Weiqing would not be able to beat him. However, Lin TianAo was very clear that it was also because it was his ultimate defense just happened to be very effective against Zhou Weiqing. It could be said that they coincidentally were able to counter Zhou Weiqing’s powerful attacks and myriad of abilities. If not for that, facing Zhou Weiqing’s powerful attacks, strong control skills, and various capabilities, any normal Five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master might not be able to defeat this fellow. If Zhou Weiqing were also at the five-Jeweled cultivation level, Lin TianAo knew that he would no longer have the confidence in beating him, and even forcing a draw would be difficult. As his mind raced and he thought up to this point, he suddenly realised that perhaps Zhou Weiqing joining might not be such a bad thing after all. With his various abilities completing his own, that would be extremely great for their entire team.\\n\\n “Little brat, you’re just at the three-Jeweled cultivation level, and you even dare dream of trying to contend for a main team position? What a joke!” Before Lin TianAo could even open his mouth, Little Four had already spoken out mockingly.\\n\\n Ye Paopao did not try to stop Zhou Weiqing, instead looking coldly from the side. His understanding of Zhou Weiqing was also from hearsay, and he had not personally witnessed Zhou Weiqing’s power. Since he was willing to come forward, Ye Paopao was naturally happy to watch, especially since he was pretty angered by their attitudes as well.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing looked towards Little Four and gave him a big grin: “Does that mean, the spots are up for contention? How about you then, shall we try it? This place is large enough. If you lose, then we’ll swap our main team and substitute positions, how about that?”\\n\\n As soon as Zhou Weiqing said that, Little Four laughed, and even the large fellow whom Lin TianAo had called Drunken Bao, as well as Crow, both laughed as well. Both of them knew Little Four’s strength, furthermore it was a three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master fighting a four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master… in their eyes Zhou Weiqing was just being foolishly overconfident. However, Xiao Yan still remained impassive, while Lin TianAo furrowed his brow.\\n\\n With a quick flash, Little Four appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing, barely one chi from him as he said: “Little brat, if I lose, I will let you have my main team position. What about if you lose?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “If I lose, I will give you a set of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls created by a Consolidating Equipment Grandmaster, how about that?” As he said that, he lifted his hand to his Spatial Necklace, and a wooden box appeared in his hands.\\n\\n Opening his box to reveal the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls within, Zhou Weiqing said: “This is a set of ninety nine Grandmaster Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, called the Overlord Bow. It is created for Strength Type Heavenly Jewel Masters, and although it is lacking one piece, the success rate is already very close to a hundred percent. Such a Consolidated Equipment which comes already with a socket is extremely rare, and I do not need to speak more about the value right.”\\n\\n Nobody had expected that Zhou Weiqing would place such a huge bet for just the place in the main team, especially since it was just a chance at it, and in their eyes, an extremely low chance. After all, such a set of Grandmaster Consolidating Equipment Scrolls was at least five hundred thousand gold coins in the market, or perhaps even higher.\\n\\n Little Four turned to look at Lin TianAo, an inquiring look in his eyes. Although Zhou Weiqing’s Overlord Bow was no use to him personally, such a set could be very valuable, either selling for gold, or more importantly, being used to change for a set of Scrolls that he could use. As such, as soon as Zhou Weiqing took it out, his eyes glowed with joy. However, he highly respected Lin TianAo and did not directly agree.\\n\\n Although Lin TianAo did not understand why Zhou Weiqing want to do this, he could guess. Firstly, to gain status, and next was to become a main team member, and be able to actually join battles. Seeing Zhou Weiqing’s resolute gaze, as his Follower, what else could he do!\\n\\n “Since this Little Bro Zhou wants to have a fight, then you two can battle it out. Do not go all out, restrain yourselves. The bet will be as you both discussed.”\\n\\n As Lin TianAo said that, Little Four’s face brightened. In his eyes, the three-Jeweled Zhou Weiqing was just like an ant. For him to be able to represent the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy for such an important tournament, he had gone through many trials and tribulations, and fought his way through nearly all the other four-Jeweled power houses in order to get this spot. Little Four had the confidence that even if he were to face any ordinary five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, he would still be able to hold his own… let alone a three-Jeweled opponent.\\n\\n Drunken Bao said leisurely: “I bet… ten moves. Who’ll take it?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan glanced at him, and said passively: “Eight moves.”\\n\\n Crow pursed her lips and said: “Seniors, you have too little confidence in Little Four. I think five moves is more than enough.”\\n\\n Hearing the three of them, Ye Paopao’s expression changed. These fellows truly looked down upon them… without question, they were betting on how many moves it would take for Little Four to beat Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n “I’ll bet with you all.” In that moment, a clear, enchanting voice rang out as Shangguan Bing’er stepped forth with an icy look on her face. Although she was usually gentle and kind, she could not back down when someone tried to bully her Little Fatty.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing watched on silently with his eyes narrowed, not at all worried, while Little Four gave a cold smirk.\\n\\n No matter who it was, looking at Shangguan Bing’er would definitely give a feeling of causing their eyes to brighten. Earlier, for the few of them besides Crow, most of their attention had been on Shangguan Bing’er. Perhaps there was a hint of wanting to show off to her when they had provoked Ye Paopao and Zhou Weiqing. Seeing Shangguan Bing’er step forward, the few of them couldn’t help but grin.\\n\\n Drunken Bao grinned and said: “Beauty, how are you going to bet with us? Why are you so protective towards this little brat, he couldn’t possibly be your boyfriend right?”\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er’s gaze did not waver as she said: “He is my fiance.”\\n\\n As soon as she said that, everyone at the other side started. From appearance alone, it was without question that Zhou Weiqing was definitely not a good match for Shangguan Bing’er, and they had never expected such an answer.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing felt a great sense of satisfaction as a smug look appeared on his face. This was the first time that Shangguan Bing’er had actually voiced such a thing out in public.\\n\\n “Ahhh, it’s really a beautiful fresh flower stuck in the you-know-what.[1. Basically, the idiom is flower stuck in shit, depicting a man together with a beauty he doesn’t deserve]” Drunken Bao said regretfully. Xiao Yan did not open his mouth, but the look in his eyes seemed rather weird. As for Crow, she looked rather puzzled, looking towards Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er, as if examining how it could be possible between the two.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er’s voice was even colder, as if not having heard Drunken Bao’s words. “Three moves. I bet that in three moves, Little Fatty can beat your Little Four. However, my bet is really huge… do you all dare to accept the bet?”\\n\\n As soon as she said that, Drunken Bao and the others started. Although it seemed to them as if Shangguan Bing’er was talking nonsense, she definitely had an imposing air about her as she spoke, that confidence in her causing them to waver a little.\\n\\n Xiao Yan opened his mouth at last: “What do you want to bet?” His voice was deep and low, with a rather stunning feel.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er continued coldly: “If he does not beat Little Four in three moves, both of us will be willing to become your Lifetime Followers, with a lifetime Seal, and vice versa for the terms of the bet. Who is willing to accept the bet?”\\n\\n Hearing Shangguan Bing’er’s words, both Zhou Weiqing and Lin TianAo almost rolled their eyes. Zhou Weiqing had never expected that Shangguan Bing’er would actually learn from his actions just a few days ago.\\n\\n As for Lin TianAo, his thoughts were much more complicated. At first, he had felt that this beautiful girl who was always following Zhou Weiqing around was a gentle, innocent and naive girl, but now he felt that it was indeed true that ‘he that lies down with dogs must rise up with fleas’[2. The actual idiom is 近朱者赤近墨者黑, the actual translation being those who go near Vermilion/Cinnabar will become red, those who go near ink will turn black. Pretty much the same meaning.] They were using this same move again, and so righteously as well; her level was definitely higher than Zhou Weiqing’s! He did not feel like Shangguan Bing’er was taking any risk at all. After all, just a few days ago, didn’t the exact same thing happen to him when he thought he had a certain victory in his bag? Alas, the final result was clear. This husband and wife pair definitely wouldn’t do anything they didn’t have a firm grasp of. Lin TianAo was extremely clear about Little Four’s abilities, and although he was very powerful, he was still far from reaching Lin TianAo himself. If he himself could be tricked by Zhou Weiqing, how could Little Four possibly win?\\n\\n Of course, Lin TianAo did not attempt to remind his brother in arms. Not because he was an indifferent or uncaring person, but because he was already Zhou Weiqing’s Follower. No matter what, he had to put Zhou Weiqing’s gain at the forefront. To put it bluntly, he was no longer the Lin TianAo of the past, but the new him has a master now.\\n\\n “I will bet with you!” Before anyone else could open their mouths, Little Four had ran over urgently and yelled out. He had never expected that anyone would look down on him so much, let alone such a beauty. Three moves? She had actually said that little brat of only three-Jewels would take three moves to handle him? That was definitely an ultimate insult, and he could never stand for that!\\n\\n Looking at Shangguan Bing’er, Little Four said: “If I win, I don’t need that little brat, I just want you as my Follower.”\\n\\n “Hey, wait a minute! Little Four, you can’t do that. I was the one who came up with the bet first, if you get the beauty, why should I bother betting? Who wants that little brat!” Drunken Bao said with a dissatisfied look on his face. However, at that point, Ye Paopao and Zhou Weiqing who had been observing coldly at the side realised that both Crow and Xiao Yan were now keeping quiet, with nary a hint that they would join in.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er said passively: “Without considering the result of this battle, Little Fatty is a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master. Even though your cultivation levels might be higher than him, in the Jewel Master world, your status’ are far from his.”\\n\\n Hearing the words Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, Drunken Bao’s eyes brightened. Everything else aside, this little brat was even younger than himself. Reaching such a Consolidating Equipment Master rank at such a young age, what would he be in the future? Perhaps even a Grandmaster Consolidating Equipment Master or better!\\n\\n If he could get such a Follower, that would be an immense gain!\\n\\n Lin TianAo sighed inwardly. He knew that at this moment, both Drunken Bao and Little Four had fallen into the trap. Just like he himself had been a few days ago, they were only looking at their possible gains, and not the hidden danger behind this enticing bet.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-8-chapter-64-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
