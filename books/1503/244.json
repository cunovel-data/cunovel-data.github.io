{"id":51418,"no":244,"title":"Chapter 76 Shangguan Xue’er (1)","content":"Chapter 76 Shangguan Xue’er (1) The sheer shock had caused her to temporarily forget the humiliation she had just suffered at the hands of Zhou Weiqing. Although the look and attributes of Elemental and Physical Jewels could be disguised by items like the Ring of Concealment, their numbers could never be hidden by any means, not even a twelve-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master could change that. Seeing the three sets of Heavenly Jewels around Shangguan Bing’er’s wrists, she was muddled. This was definitely not her sister, who had six sets of Heavenly Jewels; furthermore Shangguan Bing’er’s Elemental Jewels were only ordinary Wind Attributes. “Wait!” The white robed young lady shouted, taking a step forward, attempting to step around Fat Cat. Fat Cat gave a low howl, a thick gold light emitting from its body, forming a shield which forcibly blocked the white clad young lady from stepping forward. At the same time, the ‘King’ tattoo on Fat Cat’s forehead lit up brightly, and right in the middle of the word, a dark purple gemstone floated out from where it was hidden, as a rich purple light shone forth along with it, slowly surrounding Fat Cat’s head and turning into a purple crown which nestled onto her proud head. As the crown appeared, Fat Cat was surrounded by a brilliant purple treasure light that rose constantly, as the gold shield around her was stained with a strange tinge of purple, looking gorgeously magnificent. The white clad lady’s eyes narrowed as she exclaimed: “Divine Descent Heavens Set! You are…” “Rooarr” Fat Cat gave a low growl, interrupting the white robed girl’s words, her eyes filled with a warning look. Just as the two were facing off, tension in the air as they prepared to fight, Zhou Weiqing suddenly cleared his throat. With one hand, he pulled Shangguan Bing’er back, walking to the front and looking at the white clad young lady with an embarrassed look on his face. Smiling bitterly, he said: “Wait, everyone. Don’t fight. This… this is a misunderstanding.” Shangguan Bing’er looked at him inquiringly: “Misunderstanding? Little Fatty, what’s going on?” Zhou Weiqing had a gloomy look on his face as he said helplessly: “Just now, I was admiring this jade screen when I suddenly felt a cold behind me. When I turned around, I saw her walking up towards me, and I thought you had changed clothes. So I… I… uh… wanted to be intimate with you… and so I took advantage of her… and thus my face became like this.” As soon as the real Shangguan Bing’er appeared, Zhou Weiqing had immediately understood what happened, and realised that he had recognized the wrong person, causing the dramatic scene to take place before them. Although it was technically his fault, he was also rather helpless. After all, if even he couldn’t tell them apart, who could?! The white clad young lady also understood what had happened, and her face changed rapidly, turning red and white in succession. Her right hand gripping her sword turned almost green as she exerted too much strength. Indeed, this was a misunderstanding, and she was also extremely curious about this young girl in front of her who looked exactly like her. Did they have some connection? But… that was her first kiss! For it to be stolen away just like that in such a ridiculous scenario, she was even more vexed and gloomy than Zhou Weiqing. Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s explanation, the anger in Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes immediately vanished. With her understanding of Zhou Weiqing, though he was stuttering a little, she immediately understood what had happened. She said exasperatedly: “Hmph, who asked you to always be so bad. Serves you right!” However, though she said that, Shangguan Bing’er immediately turned to the white clad young lady. The enmity on her face had disappeared, replaced with curiosity. After all, no matter who it was, seeing someone looking exactly like them, that would be the natural reaction. “This lady, I’m really really sorry. This is truly a misunderstanding. Little Fatty definitely did not take advantage of you on purpose. As you see, you look exactly like me, and he recognized the wrong person. Although he did take advantage of you, I’m sure he did not take things too far. Since you have already beaten him up, could we let bygones be bygones please?” At that point, Shangguan Bing’er showed her grace. Although Zhou Weiqing had been beaten up, it was him at fault after all. Of course, it was due to a misunderstanding, but it did not change the fact that he had taken advantage of a girl. The white clad young lady’s breathing was rather ragged as she visibly restrained herself, glaring hard at Zhou Weiqing as the killing intent was almost piercing, causing him to feel a large pressure on his chest. “What is your name?” She asked. Of course, that question was directed at Shangguan Bing’er, and when she asked the question, she finally kept her sword and reined in her aura. Although she did not state things clearly, her actions showed that she had agreed to Shangguan Bing’er’s suggestion. Although her nature was cold, she was not an unreasonable person. This time she had indeed lost out, but it was truly a misunderstanding. However, although she restrained herself, her impression of Zhou Weiqing was still terrible.。 Shangguan Bing’er said: “My name is Shangguan Bing’er. What about you? Why do we look so alike?” The white clad young lady’s eyes revealed surprise as she said: “My name is Shangguan Xue’er.” “Shangguan Xue’er?” Both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er both exclaimed at the same time. At the same time, Fat Cat quickly released the crown and gold light, as she leapt back into Zhou Weiqing’s embrace, her body turning small in midair as she snuggled back into her usual spot. Shangguan Bing’er and Shangguan Xue’er. The two names were just too close. Hearing Shangguan Xue’er’s words, Zhou Weiqing revealed a thoughtful look, while Shangguan Bing’er grew excited. “Shangguan Bing’er? You… you…” Shangguan Xue’er also had an excited look on her face, as she examined Shangguan Bing’er’s face closely, as if her gaze could penetrate skin. When she confirmed to herself that it was no disguise or makeup, the surprise in her eyes grew stronger. As both girls stood there staring in shock at each other, they were rendered speechless. Zhou Weiqing also stood at the side, looking left and right, trying to find any difference between the two. Alas, he was still unable to make out any difference, both girls looked exactly the same, from face to figure, with only the nature in their eyes having some difference. Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes were gentle, with a soft, warm aura. Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes were rather cold, with their brilliance and essence hidden, giving others a ‘Strangers, keep away’ sort of feel. Perhaps, the only way to tell them apart was that aura. Shangguan Xue’er bit her lip as she said abruptly: “Could I please ask if your mother’s surname is Tang?” Shangguan Bing’er said in surprise: “How did you know?!” Shangguan Xue’er’s body shuddered, and her voice was shaking as she said: “You… you…” Shangguan Bing’er asked hurriedly: “Lady Xue’er, do you know my mother?” Shangguan Xue’er took a deep breath, her eyes reddening as she muttered: “How heartless of you, mother! Bing’er, you are my sister! We are triplets [1. I am guessing this is so. He used a different word 季生 instead of 孪生, but there is no such phrase in the mandarin vocabulary], you are my third sister! Please, stay here a moment, I’ll be right back, this is regarding your birth background!” Shangguan Bing’er was rather dazed, a hint of resistance in her eyes. “I… I don’t know.” Shangguan Xue’er stepped forward towards her, holding her hand and saying seriously: “Please, I beg you, wait for me. You must definitely wait for me to come back.” “Alright, we will wait here for you.” This time, the one who spoke was Zhou Weiqing. He agreed on behalf on Shangguan Bing’er. Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Shangguan Xue’er nodded towards him, before disappearing in a flash. After watching her leave, Zhou Weiqing extended his arms and enveloped Shangguan Bing’er slowly into his embrace, comforting her shocked heart. “Bing’er, calm down. No matter what, I’ll be beside you.” Shangguan Bing’er lowered her head and said: “Little Fatty, you know, since I was young, every time I tried to mention my father, mother would always be extremely angry, shouting that he was disloyal. I… I do not know if I should go on with this, I’m afraid that mother will not be happy. After all, it must have been father’s fault that caused mother to be so angry and leave.” Zhou Weiqing asked: “Did aunty ever mention you have sisters?” Shangguan Bing’er shook her head lightly, saying: “No, mother never spoke of it. However, I often saw her sitting by herself crying. Little Fatty, I really do not want my mother to be heartbroken. How about let’s leave now, I would rather not find my father if that is so.” With their looks so alike, with her intelligence, how could Shangguan Bing’er not know that what Shangguan Xue’er said was true, and that they were sisters. However, at that point, her kind heart could only think of her mother. Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Bing’er, trust me, it will all be fine. As the saying goes, ‘In order to untie the bell, it is best for the person who tied it to do so.’ No matter what happened in the past, since aunty often cries by herself, it shows that she truly loves uncle. At this time, you should not run and hide, but face everything bravely. As a daughter, what you should do is to try to resolve the issues between uncle and aunty, to let them come together again so that your family can be whole once more. If you run away today, in the future, aunty will not be the only miserable one, you will also be in the same state. As such, I agreed on your behalf. Let’s wait here for her, I believe that the truth will come to light. As long as uncle still loves aunty, no matter what problems they have between them, I believe it can be resolved.” Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Shangguan Bing’er was comforted, her expression relaxing a little. She rested her head on his shoulders, listening to his heartbeat. At this moment, they no longer had any interest in touring the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion any longer.
