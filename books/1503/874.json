There was a tinge of agony on his face, but his eyes revealed his reluctance to admit defeat. He knew that he had thoroughly lost to Long Shiya, and that there was no way from him to turn the tables around. Long Shiya was right - he lost due to his overconfidence. He had completely underestimated the Six Ultimate Heavenly God. Even though the Destruction Attribute was powerful, it did not represent everything. Long Shiya had made a name for himself for so many years, and he even possessed the six different attributes - he was not someone that was easy to be dealt with. The moment their second battle had started, Long Shiya was already on the losing end. However, this was part of his plan. Even the outcome of their first battle was set up by the Six Ultimate Heavenly God. There were several powerhouses present, but in terms of combat experience, nobody was able to match up to Long Shiya. The Six Ultimate Heavenly God did not originally come from a Saint Land, however, he relied on himself and hard work to get to where he was today. One could well imagine how much hardship he had been through, as well as the amount of effort he had put in. It could be said that he had experienced countless battles of life and death in order to become a Heavenly Emperor - an achievement that he obtained by crawling back from the brink of death countless times. This was also the main reason why Xue AoTian had always been full of admiration for Long Shiya. Perhaps, Long Shiya did not have the most powerful cultivation base. However, he would absolutely not make a single mistake on the battlefield. As for his self-mocking sinister nature, it was largely due to Zhou Weiqing. After spending a long time with his precious disciple, he had learned a couple of things from Zhou Weiqing, such as plotting traps. Both Long Shiya and Shen Mo were Low Level Heavenly Gods - however, compared to Long Shiya, even though Shen Mo possessed the Destruction Attribute, his foundation was a far cry from Long Shiya’s. It had been several years since Long Shiya had become a Max Level Heavenly Emperor. His personal will had already been refined to a level that was extremely pure. Furthermore, his battles required him to constantly control all his different attributes. Even though the series of attack he launched in the first attack had drained a significant amount of his will, it was not as powerful as it looked. Additionally, he had swayed his body in the air intentionally, to mislead Shen Mo into thinking that he was weak. Long Shiya had been well-aware for a long time; he knew that he was not the deciding factor in terms of winning the Grand Tournament. However, he had set an objective for himself - he must attain victory in his personal battle. This objective was set the moment Shen Mo stepped into the battlefield. After that, when they both went back to their respective Saint Lands to recuperate, putting aside Long Shiya’s recovery speed, Zhou Weiqing had stealthily channeled a bout of pure Saint Energy into his master’s body, helping Long Shiya restore his will. Hence, when Long Shiya rose to the sky to fight Shen Mo for the second time, his will was actually completely restored. If he were to truly go all out in the fight against Shen Mo, his chances of victory were higher. However, just like what he had mentioned earlier, if they forcefully fight each other to the end, they would both be fatally injured. Long Shiya was not afraid of that, but their battle was not the only battle of the Grand Tournament! He had to remain strong enough to help his disciple in this Grand Tournament. Therefore, after the start of the second battle, Long Shiya had performed entirely according to what Shen Mo had anticipated. In truth, he had been accumulating his energy, waiting for the right opportunity to come. When the collision between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian had ignited their battle, the first opportunity had come. However at that time, Shen Mo had not completely let down his guard. Hence, Long Shiya endured patiently and held back. Because of that, Shen Mo’s vigilance towards him had completely vanished. The moment the second opportunity arose once again, Long Shiya would launch an attack. The tiny six-colored halos should not be underestimated - they could be considered as the most powerful attack Long Shiya had ever launched in his entire life, in which he spared no effort at all. The six attributes formed two halos, according to their respective ratios. The amount of power erupted the moment they merged together had greatly surpassed that of the Low Level Heavenly God Stage. More importantly, Long Shiya had poured all of the Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing had channeled into his body earlier into this attack, in order to ensure that Shen Mo had no chance of making a comeback. Shen Mo’s Destruction Attribute could not withstand the Six Ultimate Heavenly God’s full-force attack that was merged with Saint Energy. The six-colored halos left a mark in the center of his chest, separating Shen Mo from his Heavenly God Level Heavenly Core Nucleus. Additionally, it destroyed everything within his body, transforming it into nothing. Splat—— Shen Mo spurted out a mouthful of black blood. Immediately after, a blood red light beam shot out of his chest; the six-colored halos quickly replaced the blood red light beam and a black Heavenly Core Nucleus abruptly appeared before landing right into Long Shiya’s hand. Shen Mo’s pupils gradually dilated; his entire body swayed violently in the air before he fell straight to the ground. He did not even have the chance to self-detonate. Regardless of how reluctant he was to admit defeat, it was impossible for him to change reality. His corpse had transformed into ashes and disappeared before it reached the ground. Without the protection of the Destruction Heavenly Core Nucleus, his body was extremely weak in the face of the attack of the six attributes. Long Shiya was taking deep breaths, gasping for air in the sky. He had paid a high price for this full-force attack - he was unable to use any of his Heavenly God Level powers at least for the time being. He looked towards the battle between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian on the other side. At this moment, their battle was extremely heated up. It was entirely a close combat battle - every collision created a huge distorted light halo. The Demon God that Zhou Weiqing had metamorphosed evidently had the upper hand, especially in terms of strength. It had completely overpowered the Destruction God. However, the Destruction God that Fen Tian metamorphosed was extremely tenacious. It was standing strong in the fact of the Demon God’s overbearing attacks. Their battle had already reached its climax. Long Shiya shook his head gently and sighed. He knew he was unable to interfere in a battle at such a level. Even if he rushed over, he would only bring inconvenience to Zhou Weiqing. After adjusting his body slightly and restoring a portion of his Heavenly Energy with the help of the Nature Celestial Territory next to him, he descended in the direction of the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain before joining the main battlefield on the ground, where his abilities were the most effective. Following the end of Long Shiya’s battle, it seemed as though the odds of victory were in favor of the Peerless Sect, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Putting aside the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the battle here lasted the longest. With the addition of Long Shiya into the battle on the ground, the entire situation had changed once more. Even though the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley had a much higher headcount, the Peerless Sect and the Heavenly Snow Mountain had three Heavenly Gods in their midst, including Dongfang Hanyue, the killing machine. Even though her offensive attacks had slowed down, the Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear continued to produce results with every attack. Xue AoTian’s strength mainly reflected in his assistance - after he had coordinated with Dongfang Hanyue, charging and fighting over a period of time, he had calmed down. This was because the rate at which the Heavenly Snow Mountain and its comrades were suffering casualties was alarming. If they continued to fight in that manner, even if they were to obtain the final victory, they would be left with only a few powerhouses. Hence, Xue AoTian had changed his tactic from delivering offensive attacks to providing support and assistance. Relying on his powerful strength, he constantly enhanced the physical condition of all his powerhouses. Under his help, both the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect powerhouses’ ability to survive had significantly increased. Apart from Dongfang Hanyue, the people who inflicted the most casualties were the three Shangguan sisters. The three women formed a triangle battle formation, with Shangguan Xue’er at the front, and Shangguan Fei’er and Bing’er keeping guard at the two ends. This maximized the effects of Shangguan Xue’er’s attacks. At least a few dozen enemies had died in their Saint Core Nucleus allowed them to be fearless in the face of the enemy’s Destruction Attribute. At this moment, the Heavenly Snow Mountain had lost about twenty odd powerhouses. As for the Peerless Sect, due to their low headcount, they were only left with a few people. Right now, they had lost two Heavenly Kings, with one Heavenly King injured - they were all originally from the Heavenly Demon Sect. On the other hand, the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley’s headcount had been reduced to approximately 300. If this went on, it would be hard to tell which side was going to emerge victorious. The reason why the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect’s casualties were kept significantly low was mainly due to the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dongfang Hanyue. Even though the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain was vast, however, the area of individual spaces was still limited. The Tenebrous Demon Dragon had immediately occupied a huge area just by standing there. Hence, this prevented the advantage of the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley powerhouses’ high headcount to be fully utilized. Additionally, they were fighting within a small area, and the offensive power of Dongfang Hanyue’s Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear was that overbearing. After a while, very few powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley dared to fight her head on. As they exchanged blows within a short period of time, the entire Heavenly Snow Mountain had lost a third of its height. These were Heavenly Kings and Emperors! The destructive power from their collisions were way too formidable. Even though Xue AoTian was extremely heartbroken, it was not something he could change. In the sky, the battle between the Sidhe and the two enormous dragons had reached a critical point. Perhaps it was because they sensed danger, the enormous dragons Hui Yao and Duo Si suddenly launched a suicidal type of attack. Intense dark red flames had caused a third of the Nature Celestial Territory Formation to become dark red in color. The two enormous dragons roared irritably - their enormous bodies stayed close to each other, and a huge dark red ball of light started forming around them, to the extent that the Nature Celestial Territory had no choice but to expand because of their sudden outburst. Mother Nature, created by the Sidhe Empress, immediately had a grave expression on her face - she knew what Hui Yao and his wife were doing. She placed her hands in front of her body and circled. The Nature Celestial Territory suddenly opened up like a mouth, spitting out Hui Yao and Duo Si. Immediately after, the massive amount of energy from the Life aura that came from the Nature Celestial Territory converged together and headed towards Mother Nature, including the energy released from the twelve Sidhe elders.
