{"id":52057,"no":883,"title":"Chapter 301 - Creation Time Law (1)","content":"The one thing that the Sidhe did not lack for was vitality - especially after the Ancient Tree of Life went through its second evolution. Even though the Sidhe Empress’s energy had been significantly drained at this moment, she had no problem sustaining for half a minute, the timeframe that she had given Zhou Weiqing. Moreover, even if her vitality were to be completely drained, she would be able to restore it with the help of the Ancient Tree of Life, provided she was given sufficient time. This was also one of the benefits brought about by the evolution of the Ancient Tree of Life. After the black hole in front of Zhou Weiqing’s chest had expanded to a diameter of one meter, it had finally stopped. Zhou Weiqing slowly raised both hands - he did not push it towards Fen Tian; instead, he lifted it up high above his head. Immediately after, the black hole suspended in the air, above Zhou Weiqing’s head. It expanded once again, till its diameter reached approximately three meters. The distorted light around the black hole completely became whitish gold at this moment. Immediately after, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body had also become illusory and distorted. “Come at me, Fen Tian. I will let you experience my ultimate killing technique.” Zhou Weiqing’s eyes flashed; his right hand pointed towards Fen Tian, who was being restrained by the Sidhe Empress. From within the black hole above Zhou Weiqing’s head, an intense distorted snake-like light charged straight at Fen Tian at a lightning fast speed. The distorted light might seem weak and small - it did not even create any energy ripples, however, the moment the weak-looking light had come into contact with the Sidhe Empress’ emerald green Life Energy, that was capable of trapping Fen Tian, the emerald green Life Energy had surprisingly completely vanished. Even the Sidhe Empress was swept away in a flash by the distorted light. Its target was not the Sidhe Empress; but because it came into contact with the powerful energy released by the Sidhe Empress, with the support of the twelve elders, it managed to sweep the Sidhe Empress away. How terrifying exactly was an energy as such? In the next moment, it had left a mark on Fen Tian’s ball of black Destruction Energy. The moment the Sidhe Empress was being swept away, Fen Tian attempted to escape using his fastest possible speed. However, the space in the surroundings suddenly became distorted. As a result, he had lost control of his body - his movements became extremely slow. In the next moment, the distorted light had left a mark on his body. “This…this is the Creation Time Law.” The shocked voice did not belong to Fen Tian; it belonged to the Lord of the Nether. Immediately after, the distorted halo flashed; be it Fen Tian or Zhou Weiqing, they had both disappeared in a split second. The Time Law was rather similar to the Spatial Law. However, because the Time Law belonged to the Divine Attribute, it was evidently more powerful. Furthermore, Fen Tian’s Time Attribute was not any Time Attribute - it was Creation Time Attribute. What did this mean? This meant that Zhou Weiqing’s Time Law had perfectly merged with the Creation Energy within his Saint Energy. Even Fen Tian’s powerful Destruction Energy was unable to reverse it The frenzied energy in the sky was suddenly cleaned out - even the enormous devouring hole that Fen Tian had released earlier had vanished as well. The spectators who were watching from afar could feel their hearts racing intensely. What exactly did Zhou Weiqing do? Why did he, the Sidhe Empress, as well as Fen Tian, had disappeared? Where did they go? Was it the Time Law? How could the Time Law cause the disappearance of a person? Nobody understood what happened. However, this was no longer of great importance to them anymore. When the Sidhe Empress was being swept away by the distorted light, she felt that everything in her surroundings suddenly became extremely slow. Immediately after, the energy that she had released earlier, coupled with the energy within her body, had began weakening at an extremely alarming rate. Suddenly, a ray of light flashed and she appeared at a strange place. She was in an enormous arena, which had a diameter of approximately fifty meters. The light in the surroundings were all distorted. Everything appeared to be unreal. At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared. The Sidhe Empress scrutinized and realized that it was a young boy. The clothes on his body had completely disappeared. Even though he looked like he was six or seven years old, his face gave off intense evil vibes. At this moment, he also had a shocked look on his face when he had caught the glimpse of the Sidhe Empress shortly after. “You are the Sidhe…Sidhe Empress?” A child’s voice, that was full of shock, rang through the air. Even though it was a child’s voice, it was still filled with killing intent. Furthermore, it was impossible to distinguish if the voice belonged to a boy or a girl. “Lord of the Nether?” The Sidhe Empress cried out in shock. She subconsciously looked down at herself and immediately, she was astonished. At this moment, the Sidhe Empress’ body was only as big as an infant’s. She had a pair of tiny wings on her back that could barely help her hover in mid-air. Her instincts were right - her cultivation base had almost completely disappeared. In other words, she was currently in same state as she used to be at six years old. Could the young boy before her be Fen Tian? Zhou Weiqing, what kind of skill did you use! Why did we become like this? Also at this time, a figure that was much taller and bigger than them quietly appeared within their line of sight. Zhou Weiqing, who was equipped with the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set had slowly appeared. When he saw the arena, as well as Fen Tian and the Sidhe Empress who were standing within it, he could not help but be dumbfounded. “I’ve succeeded; I’ve actually succeeded - the Time Law restored them to their childhood. Haha, I have truly succeeded.” A layer of distorted halo ripples surrounding Zhou Weiqing’s body made him look as though he was just an illusion. However, his prideful self still remained the same as before. “Weiqing, what exactly happened?” The Sidhe Empress could not help but ask that question. Furthermore, the six year old Fen Tian looked extremely devastated. Zhou Weiqing chuckled and replied, “This is one of my skills; a Time Attribute skill that I learned shortly after making a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage. This skill allows me to render all living things within a specific area to return to the state they were in, when they were in their childhood days. On the other hand, I will not be affected. The moment this skill is being utilized, it will definitely succeed, unless the individual escapes the specified area, or launch an attack on me before I’m able to carry out the skill. Originally, perhaps this skill was unable to shrink a person like Fen Tian, who possessed such a high level of Destruction Energy. However, Fen Tian was after all Fen Tian himself - he was merely borrowing the Lord of the Nether’s powers. He was not the actual Lord of the Nether. As long as he has a body, my skill would be effective on him. Moreover, this skill was unleashed by the merging of the Saint God Core Nucleus. Your Majesty, I truly have to be grateful to you. If you had not restrained him, there was no way I would have been able to use this skill. And right now, little Fen Tian, is there anything you’d like to say?
