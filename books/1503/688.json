Duo Si’s heart almost broke into two when Hui Yao’s head smashed viciously into the ground. Everyone’s heart sank, as if Hui Yao’s enormous body had returned to that of a large dragon corpse.\\n\\n “No—-!!” Duo Si cried out, grief stricken. She charged over, her enormous wings flaring open to cradled Hui Yao’s large head in her embrace. A desolate dragon croon erupted as her head lifted high, pained tears continuously streaming out of her great eyes.\\n\\n One step short of success? Destruction of hope? Duo Si’s agonized heart could no longer take such blows.\\n\\n Tian’er’s charming face had drained of all color as she collapsed into Zhou Weiqing’s embrace, but she kept her eyes unblinkingly fixed on Hui Yao’s body.\\n\\n Duo Si lowered her head and looked deeply at Hui Yao, then turning her gaze to Tian’er and Zhou Weiqing. Her tears suddenly stopped flowing. “Humans, I said before that no matter what happens, I still thank you for trying. I no longer have any strength to save our children. I beg you that when you leave, please help me save my children. I will follow Hui Yao into death, and this Lustre Spatial Realm will no longer continue fragmenting, so there is no longer any need for you all to worry. I really can’t live on without him.”\\n\\n The look in her eyes turned gentle. The days of waiting and all being for naught in the end had utterly crushed the last hope in her heart. She was going to go with him. She would be with her husband even if it was in another world.\\n\\n The three Shangguan sisters were weeping soundless tears at this point as they watched the dragon couple’s tragic scene. The were caught up in a thick sense of grief.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s brow was tightly furrowed. He wasn’t able to voice any words that would discourage Duo Si. Even if he could stop her this one time, how would he continuously stop a woman taking her life to follow her husband, much less a mighty dragon!\\n\\n Duo Si’s enormous eyes began to close slowly, her strong life force just moments ago beginning to fade. She was closing off her soul, and when it was fully closed off, she would lose her life forever. Outsiders who wished to rob a dragon of its life would have to pay a heavy price, but it was very simple for a dragon to take its own.\\n\\n Whether Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er or the Shangguan sisters, all parties present were extremely saddened in this moment. Such a strong and majestic lifeform was choosing to leave this world in this manner! How would they not be depressed?\\n\\n “Duo Si, don’t.” A low and somewhat weak voice suddenly sounded out at this time.\\n\\n Duo Si’s rapidly dispersing life force suddenly halted when this voice rang out. The humans all widened their eyes, and everyone’s gaze was focused on the enormous body on the ground. What was going on? What was happening?\\n\\n In the next moment, an enormous and extremely frightening power suddenly exploded within Hui Yao’s body. An eye-searing red light erupted like a volcano and tore through all bindings. Great energy spewed forth in the air, and the terrifying power of the heavens dyed the vicinity red.\\n\\n Duo Si’s closed eye suddenly snapped open as she lowered her head and looked at her husband’s body.\\n\\n Hui Yao’s fallen body slowly began moving. He didn’t move quickly, but did so steadily. First to rise was his proud head, followed closely by his enormous body as he slowly stood up.\\n\\n The great dragon eyes opened slowly and thick, broad wings unfurled to embrace Duo Si. A strong life-force rose steadily as his domineering dragon aura exploded in this instant to soar to the skies.\\n\\n Yes, he had come back! The dragon Hui Yao who’d once controlled the Lustre Spatial Realm had come back!\\n\\n A remarkable energy emanated from Hui Yao’s body and transformed into five red rings, circling Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er, and the Shangguan Sisters in an instant.\\n\\n All of them felt an odd pulse of energy drill into their brains via their foreheads, and their minds went blank in the next second.\\n\\n There was no change to the power and strength in their bodies, but their spiritual energy was exploding beyond all of their expectations in this moment.\\n\\n Hui Yao’s gaze landed on his wife’s body, finding her eyes and never looking away again.\\n\\n Duo Si’s life force began slowly rising again as her two claws gripped her husband tightly. She didn’t dare relax her hold on him for anything. She was so afraid that everything in front of her was just an illusion. However, as she felt the dragon aura grow and recover in Hui Yao’s body, she knew that her husband had come back at last. He’d returned to her side.\\n\\n There was only one thought in their minds at the moment, and that it was wonderful to be alive. Even creatures who’d lived for tens of thousands of years as they still felt that life was terribly precious. Perhaps, it was even more so for them.\\n\\n The red light slowly faded from the five youths, restoring the splendor in their eyes. They looked at each other with surprised delight as their spiritual strength seemed to have ascended to another level, and the strength of their souls as well. Zhou Weiqing was already at the nine-Jeweled stage, and he could vaguely feel that after this short enhancement in this short period of time, his spiritual strength had already risen to the level of a Heavenly Emperor’s. This held untold benefits for his cultivation to come, and would definitely be of enormous help for forming a Saint Core Nucleus in his future breakthrough.\\n\\n With the strength of his soul combined with the power of his bloodline, he was confident that he wouldn’t be overcome even if he had to face up against a Heavenly Emperor’s aura now.\\n\\n This was Hui Yao’s repayment for their help. He’d used the core power of the dragons to elevate the souls of Zhou Weiqing and the others. This was a highly consuming matter even for a dragon such as him, which could affect him to the core.\\n\\n The recovery of life force, the completely revival of Hui Yao, Tian’er’s successful Ressurection Skill … not only that, but Hui Yao had also gained a trace of the Saint Energy, which held great benefits for him as well. Most importantly, he was back alive again, able to see his beloved wife and children again.\\n\\n “Thank you, young humans. You saved my life. Thank you all.” Hui Yao’s gaze finally shifted from his wife and landed on Zhou Weiqing and the others. A great sense of gratitude exuded from the dragon couple. Although they didn’t say much, the raw emotions from two dragons was more than sufficient testimony.\\n\\n “There is no need to thank us,” Zhou Weiqing chuckled. “I just hope that you can continue to protect this Lustre Spatial Realm and not destroy it. That would be the greatest thanks to us.”\\n\\n Hui Yao looked closely at Zhou Weiqing. However, just as Duo Si who was by his side was about to to slowly nod in agreement, he shook his head. In a solemn tone, he said: “I’m afraid we can’t do that.”\\n\\n Hearing his words, Zhou Weiqing and the others were taken aback, their expressions changing as they looked at Hui Yao with incomprehension. They’d just saved his life! Why wouldn’t he agree to this condition that really wasn’t much of anything at all?\\n\\n Hui Yao continued staring at Zhou Weiqing, not a hint of compromise present in his gaze. “My children have been taken, and I must destroy this Lustre Spatial Realm for their sake. I can only save them if I leave here. Even though you’ve saved my life, that won’t stop me from saving them. I can at most return my life to you after I rescue my children.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s expression grew ugly, but he could not bring himself to voice any opposition. Indeed, if he was in Hui Yao’s position, as a father, how could he be willing to sit back if his children had been taken? He’d likely make the same decision himself!\\n\\n “Is there no other way?” He smiled bitterly. “Or perhaps, we can rescue your children for you?”\\n\\n Hui Yao looked at Zhou Weiqing, a red light dancing in the dragon’s eyes. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing felt as if he was being seen quite through, and a faint layer of golden light appeared around him. It seemed to have sensed a threat to Zhou Weiqing and automatically appeared.\\n\\n “This… this is the energy saved me!” The dragon was astonished. “What, what attribute is it?”\\n\\n “We call this the Saint Energy, it is actually refined from merging the four Saint Attributes: Divine, Time, Demonic and Spirit.” Zhou Weiqing didn’t hide anything.\\n\\n Instantly, Hui Yao’s eyes lit up with a bright glow. “Saint Energy… for it to be refined from the four Saint Attributes…! But… how could this be? You’re just an ordinary human. And yet… perhaps it might actually be possible…”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing had been thrown for a bit of a loop by this seeming random response. “Senior, we’ll do our best to achieve your wishes as long as you don’t destroy this realm. Perhaps I’m not strong enough at the moment, but as long as I can coalesce a Saint Core Nucleus, I’m confident of being able to hold up against even a Heavenly Emperor. Let us humans resolve human matters. I’ll definitely try my best to save your children.”\\n\\n Hui Yao nodded slowly, the light in his eyes flickering. “Your strength is far from enough. Even I wouldn’t dare say with certainty that I’d get our children back. That power… it is simply too terrifying, it’s as if it’s from…” A trace of fear actually appeared in the mighty dragon’s eyes.\\n\\n “From where?” Zhou Weiqing asked in surprise.\\n\\n The dragon remained silent for a moment. “From the Nether Realm.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing stared blankly. “Nether Realm? What’s the Nether Realm?”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-25-chapter-233-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
