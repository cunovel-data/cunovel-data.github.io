{"id":52076,"no":902,"title":"Chapter 307 - Saint Infant (3)","content":"A series of images continuously played in his mind. He could clearly remember the first time he met Tian’er - how adorable that chubby little cat was. When he was at the darkest point of his life, Tian’er had helped comforted his heart that was in great pain with her body. She had always been there for him at all times, till now. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s heart had ached so badly that he was unable to breathe. He had even forgotten where he actually was. Tian’er, Tian’er…… Zhou Weiqing was unable to restrain the anguish within his heart. The heart-wrenching grief had caused the Life Energy that was combusting in his body to become extremely unstable - even the Sidhe Empress, who was outside the seal, could sense his call. Pff - the Destructive light was about to hit Tian’er’s body. In that instant, Tian’er’s body immediately became stiff. The protective Saint Energy had been disintegrated by the light beam from the Eye of Destruction almost instantly; it was a terrifying energy that even Zhou Weiqing was unable to resist! Without a sound, the Destructive light landed on Tian’er’s body. She had already shut both eyes. Even though she could not bear to leave, she had no regrets. Being able to shield her man from this attack, even if it was just for a split second, she had absolutely no regrets. The Lord of the Nether’s eyes were filled with immense joy. He was waiting in excitement for Zhou Weiqing’s negative emotions to fully erupt, as well as the release of Tian’er’s own negative emotions upon her death. However, the look in his eyes froze in the next moment. In fact, his entire body started trembling violently. That was because Tian’er’s body did not vanish despite being hit by the Destructive light. On the contrary, a layer of extremely gentle and harmless-looking white halo radiated from her body. When the powerful Eye of Destruction’s light came into contact with the white gentle light, it was instantly destroyed, akin to cheese coming into contact with a red-hot steel knife. In a blink of an eye, the Destructive light had completely vanished. The gentle white light gently surged right in front of the Eye of Destruction, which had stiffened up. In the next moment, as the black aura spewed out from the Lord of the Nether’s mouth in a frenzy, the Eye of Destruction had vanished into thin air. “This, this is impossible!” The Lord of the Nether shouted hysterically. He could not bring himself to believe everything that happened before his eyes was real. The Lord of the Nether sensed the layer of white gentle light; Zhou Weiqing had similarly sensed it too. As tears trickled down his face, he felt a bout of extremely warm energy that had suddenly enveloped his body within it. Immediately after, the Life Energy that had been depleted earlier was restored at a speed that was even faster than the speed it was exhausted at. Similarly, the Saint Energy within his body returned to his body at a miraculous speed. Furthermore, the Saint Energy was no longer whitish golden and neither was it of the white incandescent color that occurred after being purified. Instead, it was a gentle shade of white that Zhou Weiqing struggled to describe in words. It was a gentle shade of white that was filled with Creation. Instinctively, Zhou Weiqing opened both eyes. His pupils dilated instantly - what did he see? He saw it; it was a pure and holy radiance that was flickering within the Netherworld, that was filled with darkness and Destructive Energy. Tian’er did not die - she was hovering there with both eyes closed. Circles of gentle white light continuously spread out from her lower abdomen area. At this moment, a resonant cry of a baby was heard. A ball of gentle white light floated out of Tian’er’s lower abdomen. Indeed, there were no wounds on Tian’er. However, a small infant flew out of her lower abdomen. The baby was around fifty centimeters in length - its tiny fists were tightly clenched. Both its legs were folded in front of its chest; its pink and tender buttocks looked extremely adorable, giving people the urge to bite them. Furthermore, a cute little thing could be seen between its legs. It was a boy. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was in a daze, and so was Tian’er. Everything that was happening was beyond their field of knowledge. Not only was the Lord of the Nether in disbelief, they, who were the originators, were in utter disbelief as well. However, everything had just happened before their eyes. The gentle white light curtain was emitted from this tiny body, immersing Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er within it. Their Saint Energy had similarly become a gentle shade of white. After the tiny infant had floated out of Tian’er’s lower abdomen, he gradually opened his eyes. Even though his body was still curled up, at this moment, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er could see a pair of clear black eyes. Within the black eyes, it seemed as though they were able to see other side of the world. At this moment both of them could clearly sense everything being elevated. The Lord of the Nether had already flown far away, the moment the Eye of Destruction had been destroyed. He stared dumbfoundedly at everything that was happening. He could clearly sense all the Destructive Energy within the Netherworld disappearing at a terrifying speed. It was vanishing due to the gentle white light that was released from the infant’s body. This, this is impossible. The Lord of the Nether’s soul was trembling. This was because he had identified what the gentle white light was. It was Saint Energy, but not the same Saint Energy released by Zhou Weiqing. Instead, it was the Creation Saint Energy - the actual Creation Saint Energy! It was the world’s most terrifying and powerful energy that only the Creation God possessed, containing boundless Creation Energy. Could it be that…he is the reincarnation of the Creation God, the Saint Infant……? The Lord of the Nether was filled with despair, just like how Zhou Weiqing was earlier on. At this moment, he was no longer able to gather the strength to counter it. This was because everything was futile in the face of the actual Creation Energy. “Tian’er.” Zhou Weiqing’s figure flashed and appeared next to Tian’er. He hugged her tightly in his embrace. Tian’er looked at Zhou Weiqing as well and said in a trembling voice, “This…this is our child.” At this moment, she had already made the association - the white light that appeared during the attack had been her child who had been protecting her all along. And at this very moment, he was born. “Yes, he is our son.” Zhou Weiqing’s voice was trembling as well. He could sense the changes in his Saint Energy. Even though he could not judge it as well as the Lord of the Nether, he understood that the battle had ended; it had truly ended. His family was the final victor. The tiny infant gradually floated towards Tian’er, and landed in her arms. His eyes were wide open, and full of verve. He looked at Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, as he was filled with a sense of novelty upon his arrival in this world. Even though Dongfang Hanyue had also given birth to a son for Zhou Weiqing, witnessing the birth of his child elicited a completely different feeling after all. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was filled with excitement and joy. Subconsciously, he lifted his hand in an attempt to gently caress this adorable little life that had given his parents a new life. However, evidently, that little fella did not seem to respect a certain somebody - his white tender hand stretched forward and grabbed Tian’er’s lapel, while the other hand reached into her clothes and started groping naturally. Zhou Weiqing was dumbfounded by what he saw. In the next moment, that little fella took out something fair, round and bulging and his soft lips started to suck on it, while Tian’er gasped in shock. Was this a lustful instinct or a survival one? Zhou Weiqing was somewhat at a loss. However, in the process, he immediately thought of an important task that he had yet to complete. He lifted his head and used his sharp eyes to look for a certain figure. Now that Zhou Weiqing possessed the actual Creation Energy, even though he was not the Creation God, he could more or less be considered as one. Even if the Lord of the Nether was in his peak condition, he might not be on par with Zhou Weiqing, let alone his current heavily injured self. However, as Zhou Weiqing searched for him, he was shocked to realize that the Lord of the Nether had disappeared. The surroundings were still pitch-black, just like before, and the Lord of the Nether was nowhere to be seen. That fella ran off? Zhou Weiqing snorted, “Lord of the Nether, do you think that you can run away? I’ll tear your Netherworld apart and let’s see where else you can run off to.” Now that he possessed the Creation Saint Energy, he was no longer worried about the seal of the Netherworld. The Lord of the Nether might be able to hide in the Netherworld, but what if it no longer existed? Where else could he hide? Zhou Weiqing’s body released a rich Saint Energy light that transformed into an enormous white halo that expanded outwards. All the Destructive Energy in the surroundings were being purified at an alarming speed. Everything that came into contact with the Creation Saint Energy was full of vigor, void of any Destructive forces. “Little fella, don’t be anxious. It’s better to leave the Netherworld intact. As for the Lord of the Nether, let me deal with it for you.” At this moment, a clear and melodious voice was heard. Immediately after, a strange blue light appeared out of nowhere within the dark space. Zhou Weiqing’s Creation Saint Energy was extremely powerful, however, the moment the blue figure had appeared, his body emitted a ray of golden light, forcing all of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy to retreat. In a blink of an eye, Zhou Weiqing looked horrified. Who’s that? Why is it that the Creation Saint Energy had no effect on him? The blue figure had revealed itself - it was a young man, with handsome features. His long, blue hair cascaded behind his shoulders, akin to the ocean. He was wearing a blue robe that was also akin to the ocean, which covered his entire body within it. Additionally, he was holding onto a golden weapon in his right hand. The dazzling golden light had lit up almost the entire Netherworld, including the Lord of the Nether who was curled up in a corner. It was a golden trident.
