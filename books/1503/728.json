The Hate Ground No Handle set… what an impressive Legacy of Strength!” Dreamwake’s eyes lit up. She didn’t display any hint of anger at having suffered a loss just now; instead, her beautiful eyes turned cold and calm.\n A calm opponent was the most terrifying of all. Zhou Weiqing was quite wary of her ‘transformation’ and thus said probingly, “Why don’t we just let it end here? Let’s consider it a draw?”\n Dreamwake’s reply was hard enough to sever iron and chop nails: “In. Your. Dreams.”\n As soon as her words came out, Dreamwake once more charged forwards. This time, she was even faster! She appeared before Zhou Weiqing with a flicker, then suddenly vanished before Zhou Weiqing even had the chance to lift up his two Dual Legendary Hammers.\n Spatial Shuttle!\n The Spatial Attribute was absolutely necessary for a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. Dreamwake naturally had access to techniques like Spatial Shuttle.\n Zhou Weiqing didn’t dare to hesitate at all. As soon as Dreamwake vanished before him, he himself used Spatial Shuttle as well. Two streaks of silver light flashed past each other in quick succession, with Dreamwake’s dragon-claw attack sweeping through Zhou Weiqing’s previous position just a moment after he vanished, tearing through the shadowy blur left behind by his Spatial Shuttle.\n As soon as Zhou Weiqing reappeared, he lifted up his dual hammers and spun them around himself. This decision was the correct one, because as soon as he appeared Dreamwake had already moved right next to him. She didn’t really have many options for dealing with the overwhelmingly superior power of the Dual Legendary Hammers, and so she bent over backwards to dodge like a reverse bow. It looked as though she didn’t have any bones in her body! As she did this, she delivered a flying kick with her right foot. This kick came in right within the empty space between the two hammers and was aimed at Zhou Weiqing’s chest.\n A thunderous explosion rang out, followed by Zhou Weiqing staggering three steps backwards. Dreamwake wasn’t any better off, as she was sent flying backwards as well.\n By now, Dreamwake had a thorough understanding of the tremendous power the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation possessed. As her kick had landed against Zhou Weiqing’s chest, dozens of Lightning Pearls had gathered across his chest. Her kick had landed atop those Lightning Pearls, causing a tremendous explosion which had blasted her and Zhou Weiqing apart. Her kick, which should have guaranteed her victory, was forced to retract as well.\n The way in which the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation allowed for techniques to be instantly cast could be described as ‘freakishly powerful’, especially given how little Heavenly Energy it used.\n The Flying Lightning God technique was Zhou Weiqing’s favorite technique. As soon as the two had been blasted apart, Zhou Weiqing released a second instant-cast technique. Once again it was the Flying Lightning God, but this time the Lightning Pearls were transformed into bolts of lightning. Over a hundred bolts of lightning appeared simultaneously, shooting straight at Dreamwake.\n The flashing lightning was simply too fast, and they had all been insta-cast. There was no way to dodge them at all! With no other options available, Dreamwake summoned a buckler of black light over her head. A series of explosions could be heard as all of the lightning bolts slammed into the black shield of light and then disappeared. However, this ensured that Dreamwake was unable to press the attack against Zhou Weiqing.\n Dreamwake had completely discarded her previous contempt towards Zhou Weiqing. This extraordinarily talented fellow was even harder to deal with than she had imagined! This was especially true for the instant-cast skills of his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, which could be used to block her attacks at the most critical moments. If she was able to use her full power the formation wouldn’t pose any problem, as she could overwhelm him with her might. However, she was only able to use the six-Jeweled cultivation level, which meant that she didn’t dare to use many energy-intensive skills. In addition, the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation insta-cast skills far too quickly. She couldn’t guarantee that her skills wouldn’t be disrupted.\n Zhou Weiqing was just as surprised as Dreamwake was. Dreamwake was a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. How could she have this much combat experience? Zhou Weiqing felt certain that he himself was extremely experienced in battle, but Dreamwake seemed to be just as experienced. She had instantly discovered the speed-related weakness he had when he used attacks of raw power, and she had been flexible enough to very nearly defeat his defenses. More importantly, thus far both sides were still just launching ‘probing’ attacks, with neither having launched any full-power attacks yet.\n Although both had suppressed their cultivation levels to the six-Jeweled stage, this was still an extremely fair fight. Although Zhou Weiqing hadn’t reached the Heavenly King level yet, he had Saint Energy. If he used his Saint Energy, even if Dreamwake was a Heavenly King powerhouse she still wouldn’t be able to gain an advantage against him. For them to both suppress their cultivation bases made for a fair and safe fight.\n After the black buckler dispersed the lightning bolts, the two stared at each other silently. Neither continued to press the attack, as they both stared vigilantly. Their auras were completely locked onto each other, ready to attack at any moment.\n Zhou Weiqing narrowed his eyes slightly, the two Legendary Hammers to each side of his body drooping downwards slightly. In his heart, he was celebrating. Thank goodness that Dreamwake’s two Physical Jewels didn’t represent a pairing of ‘flexibility’ and ‘speed’! If it had, he would be in an even more passive situation. It would be hard to defeat her while hiding his true power.\n Dreamwake suddenly blew out a long breath, causing Zhou Weiqing to instantly sense as though the surrounding area had become much cooler. Specks of blue light began to fly out from Dreamwake’s body, almost instantly covering an area of hundreds of square meters.\n Was this an aura? No. This was Heavenly Dao Energy being used to influence the local atmospheric energies.\n “You are cheating!” Zhou Weiqing glared at her.\n Dreamwake stared back at him coldly. “And how am I cheating? I only said I’d limit myself to the six-Jeweled cultivation level. I never said I would refrain from using the techniques I’m skilled in!”\n Zhou Weiqing stared at her, rather speechless. “This is an effect caused by Heavenly Dao Energy manipulating the atmospheric energies. How is it not cheating?”\n Dreamwake snorted. “All I said was six-Jeweled cultivation level. It’s not my fault that my will and my senses are superior. It’s your own fault for being weak! Why don’t you go ahead and summon atmospheric energies as well, if you can?”\n Although they were in a separate Spatial area, this place was still filled with abundant atmospheric energies. For her to use Heavenly Dao Energies to summon atmospheric energies in this manner meant that she had an almost unlimited amount of energy. Her attacks might be limited to the six-Jeweled level, but she would be able to unleash an unlimited amount of said attacks! Although Zhou Weiqing was strengthened by the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, he couldn’t use it in the way she just had. More importantly… he might have the ability to sense and use Heavenly Dao Energy, but he didn’t dare to actually employ it!\n “You are being a bully,” Zhou Weiqing complained angrily.\n A hint of laughter flashed through Dreamwake’s eyes. “Yes, and I’m going to bully the hell out of you.” As her words came out, she shot forwards towards Zhou Weiqing once more. This time, it was completely different from her previous attacks. The coldness in the air instantly increased in strength, with countless streams of frost wrapping themselves towards Zhou Weiqing as Dreamwake attacked. The cold energy began to furiously drill deep into his body.\n Although they wouldn’t have an impact on him right away, given enough time they would result in his movements growing stiff and cumbersome, while he would use up far more Heavenly Energy as well.\n Originally, Dreamwake hadn’t been planning on doing this. However, Zhou Weiqing’s tremendous strength paired with his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was quite troublesome for her to deal with. She absolutely had to win this battle. It wasn’t just out of anger; she wanted to suppress Zhou Weiqing and prove her superiority. Even she herself didn’t fully understand why she had brought Zhou Weiqing here today. Was it really just because she was angry over what happened the other day? No. She wasn’t willing to admit that that her heart, which had been untouched for thirty years, had grown restless as of late.\n Light flickered in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes as he swept out with his Dual Legendary Hammers swept out. As they shot out, his body became covered with a dense layer of azure light. He hurriedly retreated while lifting up those hammers, then delivered a vicious downwards blow with them.\n Dreamwake was startled by Zhou Weiqing’s sudden acceleration. This was a speed-enhancing technique of the Wind Attribute. So his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was even able imitate support techniques like this?\n A thunderous explosion rang out, causing nearly the entire Spatial area to shudder violently. The overwhelmingly powerful shockwave from the blow blasted apart the majority of the atmospheric energies which had been summoned by Dreamwake while halting her attack as well.\n Such incredible power! Dreamwake narrowed her eyes. Only now did she truly understand how terrifyingly strong Zhou Weiqing was. He hadn’t been bragging at all; even if she did use Heavenly King-level strength, she still probably wouldn’t be able to match the power of the blow he had just dealt to the ground with his dual hammers.\n A heartbeat later, Dreamwake suddenly felt a strong sense of danger in her heart. She stared, astonished, as a streak of purple-red light shot out from behind Zhou Weiqing, transforming into a strange creature that hung in the air above him.\n Heavenly Skill Image?\n Dreamwake was shocked. Zhou Weiqing was only at the six-Jeweled level and had just recently reached that level. As far as she knew, someone at that level couldn’t possibly be able to access a powerful technique which would result in a Heavenly Skill Image appearing! In addition, she felt a tremendous sense of danger coming from the aura of this attack.\n She didn’t hesitate at all. A Heavenly Skill Image instantly appeared behind Dreamwake as well. She didn’t even give Zhou Weiqing to clearly see what the image was before sending it flying straight towards the image of the Demonic Dragon Lady above Zhou Weiqing.\n The Heavenly Skill Images clashed against each other. Alas, Zhou Weiqing had prepared for this long ago. After having suffered at the hands of ‘Lion Prince’ Gu Yingbing all those years ago, he had pondered over his painful experiences and decided that he would never again use his Heavenly Skill Image unless he was completely sure of his chances! He let out cold snort, followed by yet another streak of purple-red light flying out. This time, it was aimed directly at Dreamwake’s image! The two streaks of light collided in midair, then disappeared simultaneously.\n He actually had two Heavenly Skill Image techniques?! Dreamwake was shocked, but her reaction was incomparably fast. She didn’t continue to try and clash with Heavenly Skill Images… because she had the feeling that Zhou Weiqing was almost done with his technique.\n A streak of black light suddenly burst out of Dreamwake’s body. The sense of danger she felt forced her to unleash some of her own special techniques.\n The freezing aura in the air suddenly became moody and sinister. Dreamwake’s body was now covered with a layer of thick black fog, and there was something writhing within the black fog which Zhou Weiqing wasn’t able to see clearly.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-247-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
