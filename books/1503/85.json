At that time, the rose coloured Alexandrite Cat’s Eye around his left wrist could clearly be seen to be surrounded by bright crackling blue electricity.\\n\\n As Zhou Weiqing focused his will, the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel quietly moved and slid into the socket on the Overlord Bow. Instantly, the misty white bow turned into a brilliant blue, even down to the bowstring. Zhou Weiqing felt a sense of numbness in his body as if he were being given a minor electric shock, as bolts of electricity crackled around his wrist, and flowing towards the body of the bow in a brilliant light.\\n\\n “Who’s there?!” A sudden loud shout came from below, followed by hurried footsteps from the distance heading towards the watchtower.\\n\\n Now that Zhou Weiqing was standing high up on the watchtower to have a good view, it also meant that others would be able to spot him easily. Normally, the dark of the night would be sufficient cover for him. However, now that he was preparing to use his Elemental and Physical Jewel Fusion Technique, causing the Overlord Bow to glow so brightly, how could he not be seen?\\n\\n Taking in a deep breath, with the four energy whirlpools at his Death Acupuncture Points spinning at full speed, he slowly drew back the extremely tough bowstring of the Overlord Bow. The Stars Wood body of the arrow he was nocking at this point was actually affected, and turned into a piercing blue colour.\\n\\n As Zhou Weiqing drew the Overlord Bow, he felt as though his entire body had a strong suction force on his surroundings. The force seemed to draw in the Lightning energy from the surroundings, and the sheer destructive force of it seemed to be a primed explosive ready to blow up at any second.\\n\\n The patrolling soldiers were now charging over. Alas for them, there weren’t any archers amongst the patrolling soldiers, and they could only climb up the watchtower as fast as they could.\\n\\n The Overlord Bow stretched to its limit, its bright light reflecting and contrasting with the moonlight and starlight in the skies. Shangguan Bing’er could see everything clearly from the distance, and with Zhou Weiqing perched vulnerably atop the the watchtower, she did not stay idle. Shooting forth arrow after arrow from a long distance, she was picking off the soldiers individually as they attempted to climb up the watchtower to get to him.\\n\\n *Clang* *Clang* *Clang* The piercing sound of an alarm gong rang out, and the entire Kalise Empire camp was instantly roused up, this campsite of several tens of thousands of soldiers riled up in a mess due to just Zhou Weiqing alone.\\n\\n Right at that moment, an immense roar that shook everyone’s soul rang out suddenly. The entire sky was filled with a immense bolt of blue lightning, so very clear in the pitch black night. Like a descending meteor, the blue lightning bolt flew right straight into the midst of the Kalise Empire Camp.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing did not even look at the results of his strike, as he swiftly shot three more ordinary arrows to pick off the climbing soldiers, then with his right foot stamping hard onto the watchtower floor, he launched himself into the air.\\n\\n *BANG——* The explosion that rang out first was from the bolt of blue lightning. Although the target was a kilometer away, the power and speed of the arrow shot from the Overlord Bow was just too terrifying.\\n\\n In the ensuing violent blast, the large tent a kilometer away which Zhou Weiqing had targeted instantly exploded with a deafening sound. If one were to observe from above, the tent’s explosion causing a ring of blue light to spread out from the ground zero of the explosion. Flames sprang forth and screams and cries were heard.\\n\\n It was quickly followed by four smaller explosions, three of which were caused by the latter three arrows Zhou Weiqing fired. He did not even bother aiming, and just shot them into where there were more soldiers massed. With the explosive effect of the Overlord Bow, even though Zhou Weiqing did not make use of any Elemental Jewel skills, the arrows were still extremely deadly, exploding right in the midst of all the incoming Kalise soldiers and causing at least ten or so casualties per strike.\\n\\n As for the last rumbling sound, it was actually due to Zhou Weiqing destroying the watchtower. The floor of the top part of the watchtower actually disintegrated as he stomped hard onto it, while he made use of the opposing force to launch himself away.\\n\\n By this time, Shangguan Bing’er had already stood up in the distance, the Purple Dawn Bow in her hands launching out arrows unceasingly, wielding the Rapid Fire skill to its maximum possibility. In that short amount of time, she had shot forth more than 30 arrows, single-handedly suppressing the soldiers from chasing Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n “Let’s go!” Zhou Weiqing charged forth and signaled to Shangguan Bing’er. Both of them immediately turned and fled at top speed, not even looking back.\\n\\n At this moment, ten figures flew ahead from the Kalise Army, and one of them could be heard shouting: “The granary is burning! Xiao Ye Ye, go and organize a team to put out the fires and save as much as you can! The rest of you, follow me. We must not allow them to escape!”\\n\\n The person who spoke was naturally the 9th Prince of the Kalise Empire, Bai Jiu, and the ten other figures were the other Jewel Masters in the camp. No one could possibly be in a good mood after being awakened from deep sleep suddenly, not to mention being startled awake in fear. Bai Jiu’s tent was rather close to the large tent that was Zhou Weiqing’s target, and the immense explosion had not only given him such a huge shock that he was awakened, but he had even wet his pants. As a result, he was angered so much that his face turned pale, and he had quickly changed his pants and rushed out, leading the Jewel Masters to give chase crazily.\\n\\n “Little Fatty, what was that skill you used just now? Why was there such a massive effect?” Shangguan Bing’er asked curiously as they ran along in retreat. Even though she was so far away, the immense explosion had given her a shock.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh, I have successfully completed Storing all the Skills for my first Elemental Jewel. Remember that arrow which saved your life? That was using the Darkness Skill, named ‘Touch of Darkness’, and you have already seen how it is compatible with the Overlord Bow’s fusion technique.”\\n\\n “The one that I used today is the only attacking skill I have, and I managed to get it from a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast that I do not know the name of, and was found in the last door which have various unknown or mutated Heavenly Beast. The skill name is called ‘Lightning Explosive Palm’, and is originally a strong melee skill. However, when used together with the Overlord Bow, it actually has an impressive change. Just think, the ‘Lightning Explosive Palm’ has a strong explosive effect of its own coupled with the lightning attribute. The explosive effect of my Overlord Bow compounds it, and with this double explosive effect, how can it not have a huge explosion?\\n\\n “Alas, with the limited Heavenly Energy that I have, I can only use a single fusion technique no matter which skill I use. If not, I would repeatedly fire skills and wreak havoc on them.”\\n\\n Listening to his words, a cold thrill ran through Shangguan Bing’er’s heart. She knew that if she fought with Zhou Weiqing in a one versus one battle now, he would likely lose to her. After all, she had a huge advantage in terms of amount of Heavenly Energy, and also had the boost of an additional set of Heavenly Jewels. However, she could just imagine once Zhou Weiqing cultivated more and got sufficient energy to sustain all his skills, that would be extremely terrifying. With the advantage he had from having multiple elemental attributes, he did not even need to cooperate with anyone, and could just do so himself by combining skills with synergy.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-22-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
