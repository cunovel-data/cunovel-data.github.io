Even though it was still present, it was not as dense and pure as it used to be.\n “Tian’er, why did you follow me here?” Zhou Weiqing pulled Tian’er over, from his back, and held her small hand. For a moment, all kinds of feelings welled up in his heart.\n The seal had been completed. However, both he and Tian’er were brought to the Netherworld. Right now, the only thing that Zhou Weiqing could sense was their unavoidable impending death.\n Tian’er looked at Zhou Weiqing; she seemed to be completely unaffected by everything in the external world, “Silly boy, how can I leave the father of my child to die alone? No matter what, I want to be with you. Don’t think about abandoning me.”\n Zhou Weiqing held Tian’er’s hand tightly. He did not reprimand her any further. Everything that had happened, happened. It was pointless for him to say anything more at this juncture.\n “Well, isn’t this very touching? Is this what you human beings call ‘love’?” A neutral voice was heard coming from all directions.\n The space that was originally filled with darkness had brightened up.\n A light appeared in front of them - it was a green halo, rather indistinct. Nonetheless, it effortlessly gave people feel a sense of fear.\n The massive body appeared within the green light - it was a huge crab. Its width was almost a thousand meters; and its eight legs were spread wide open. Upon further scrutiny, countless veined patterns could be seen on its body, and these veined patterns looked like human faces. Every single face had a different expression - there was anger, fright, and resentment. Each one of them was different, but they were all pertaining to negative emotions.\n Two gigantic eyes were located at the top of its body; they radiated like two small green suns. Not far from the eyes, there was a huge gap on its massive body. It was where the pincers used to be. Evidently, its actual body was the one that self-detonated.\n The Lord of the Nether; Zhou Weiqing had finally seen the actual body of the Lord of the Nether in person. That fella before his eyes had already evolved to the Heavenly Change Stage. Furthermore, the Destructive Energy, the polar opposite of Creation Energy, that he possessed had reached the Heavenly Change Stage as well.\n “You make people feel disgusted just by looking at you,” said Zhou Weiqing with a disdainful look on his face.\n The Lord of the Nether did not rage because of his words, “What’s the point of sneering at me in my world? I had never expected my plan to be destroyed by a puny human like you.”\n Zhou Weiqing laughed coldly, “You expect me to be praising you, instead of insulting you? If I do that instead, will you let me go then?”\n The Lord of the Nether replied in an enchanting voice that was full of charm, “Why won’t I let you go? As long as I get to imprint a Destructive mark on your soul, which will help me break through the seal, not only will I let you go - I will even allow you to return to the human world. You can become my ambassador in the human world. I can even promise you that I will set aside a piece of land for you, allowing you to lead a comfortable and blissful life.”\n Zhou Weiqing laughed out loud, “Hahahahaha, Lord of the Nether, are you trying to lie to a three year old toddler? We managed to seal you after struggling hard for a period of time - you expect us to let you go that easily? Furthermore, do you actually think that you’re able to imprint your Destructive mark on my soul? My body is almost entirely formed by Saint Energy - stop daydreaming.”\n “In that case, you will only end up perishing.” The voice of the Lord of the Nether abruptly became cold. An intense killing intent erupted from his body, without any reservations, akin to violent waves that crashed hard into Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s bodies.\n A dense whitish golden Saint Energy light flickered on Zhou Weiqing’s body, enveloping him and Tian’er within it. After all, he had once experienced the profoundness of the Heavenly Change Stage. Furthermore, he had merged himself with the Dragon Emperor’s energy. Even though it was impossible for him to become the Creation God, his cultivation base had increased.\n “Bring it on then. Let’s see if I can cut off a few of your crab legs before you kill me.”\n Right now, the Lord of the Nether seemed to not be in a hurry to attack Zhou Weiqing. Within his pair of huge dark green eyes, a strange light flickered.\n “Zhou Weiqing, are you curious as for why I brought the both of you here, instead of using the final moment of my self-detonation to attack the two of you instead? I paid such a hefty price by self-detonating in order to bring you into the Netherworld - don’t you find it strange?”\n Zhou Weiqing’s interest was piqued, “Why? Do you want to clear my doubts?”\n The Lord of the Nether let out a series of wicked laughter, “Why not? Do you think that completing the seal using your Saint Energy is enough to thoroughly seal me forever, and that I’ll never be able to get out again? Even to the extent that it’s impossible for me to establish any contact with the external world?”\n As he spoke, he slowly retracted the killing intent that was erupted earlier on.\n Zhou Weiqing maintained his composure and said, “Isn’t that the case? Lord of the Nether, playing tricks like these isn’t going to work. No matter what, I will not be deceived by you.”\n The Lord of the Nether snorted disdainfully, “Tricks? Do you think I have to resort to tricks to get you? Your lives are in my hands. I merely wanted you to die in peace. Truth be told, indeed, with you as the leader, and with the Saint Energy replacing the original Dragon Emperor Energy as the core of the newly completed seal, it is already impossible for me to break through the seal. I am also unable to be connected to the external world to strengthen myself. This time, my injuries and damages are unprecedented. I have also lost the ability to forcefully break the seal once again. My cultivation base had been severely weakened and I have lost my pincers. Furthermore, my original Destructive Energy had been exhausted. Right now I am no longer considered a true Heavenly Change powerhouse - I have been demoted to a level that is slightly more powerful than Fen Tian was.”\n After hearing the Lord of the Nether’s words, a tinge of joy appeared in Tian’er’s eyes. However, on the contrary, Zhou Weiqing had a grave look in his eyes.\n The self-detonation was brief - what did this signify? It signified that even though the Lord of the Nether’s cultivation base had been weakened, he still had absolute confidence in dealing with the two people. This was Zhou Weiqing’s line of logic. Moreover, the Lord of the Nether did not try to talk them into breaking through the seal. Instead, he recounted his own circumstances. Furthermore, he was in a calm state of mind. Could it be that he still had a method to deal with the seal? Was he going to make use of Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er?\n Since he was a child, Zhou Weiqing had been learning from Mu En. He had a much better understanding of human nature and words compared to Tian’er.\n Indeed, the Lord of the Nether sighed indistinctly, “ I had never expected myself to be forced into such circumstances. However, there is still a small opportunity that I created for myself. I’m not afraid to let you know that in the final moments, when I detonated my pincers, if you were to release the formation by just a bit, there was a possibility that I could have broken through the seal. Even if I lose a portion of my will, as long as I continue to cultivate and continuously absorb the resentment and negative emotions in the human world, it was only a matter of time before I restored my powers. Unfortunately, you were willing to sacrifice your life in order to stop me. However do you think that I would allow you to seal me? Zhou Weiqing, you forgot the most important thing - even though the formation of the seal might be powerful, it requires constant channeling of energy. The Saint Energy that you channeled earlier on was sufficiently massive, hence it is possible for the seal to last for at least ten years from now. However, what will happen after ten years? Don’t tell me that there is another person in the human world that possesses the same pure Saint Energy and the original Dragon Emperor Energy who will become the new leader taking charge of the seal? Hahahahahaha.”\n After hearing what the Lord of the Nether had said, Zhou Weiqing’s facial expression finally changed. He had already understood what he meant.\n “Originally, when you sent this lady flying, I was in despair. After all, she possessed the same pure Saint Energy just like you. With the support of the Sidhe Empress and the newly appointed Dragon Emperor, it is possible for her to replenish the Saint Energy. Unfortunately, she could not bear to leave you, and ended up coming here with you! The heavens were practically on my side. As long as I kill the both of you here and quietly wait for the Saint Energy that was supporting the formation to fully deplete, even if I can’t break through the formation at my current cultivation base, I can at least secretly create a small crack and reabsorb the resentment and negative emotions to nourish my body. In less than a few decades, I will have the ability to attack the formation once again. By then, I’d sure like to see if anyone else that is able to stop me from entering the human world.”\n Zhou Weiqing looked very distraught. Tian’er was in a daze, while she stood next to him. She had never expected that her love for Zhou Weiqing inadvertently created an opportunity for the Lord of the Nether.\n “Tian’er, ignore what he said. He is trying to cause a rift between us. If I guessed correctly, he does not have absolute confidence in killing us.”\n Zhou Weiqing’s cold voice rang through the air - both he and Tian’er were able to hear it clearly. Tian’er had already possessed the Divine and Spirit Attributes, which later transformed into the Saint Attribute. Her will was much stronger than her counterparts of the same level. Even though it was not on par with Zhou Weiqing’s, after receiving a reminder from him, her mind cleared up immediately. The negative emotions she experienced earlier vanished in an instant. A clear and resolute look appeared in her eyes once again.\n The Lord of the Nether’s voice ceased abruptly, “What did you say? I cannot kill you?” The Lord of the Nether shrieked, as though he had heard something that was extremely unimaginable.\n Zhou Weiqing nodded without any hesitation and said, “That’s right, you are not confident of killing us. Am I right? Lord of the Nether, you are truly devious.”\n “Don’t tell me you assumed that everything I said were lies? Do you think it’s necessary for me to lie to a small fry like you?” The Lord of the Nether was clearly rather angry.\n Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said, “No, what you said were not lies. On the contrary, you were stating the truth. Hence, it was easier for you to confuse us. You were planning to use that speech to cause a rift between Tian’er and I. At the same time, you wanted us to feel remorseful, which would generate negative emotions as a result. Indeed, you’re unable to receive the Destructive Energy that was transformed by the negative emotions from the external world. However, you’re still able to absorb the negative energy released by us to nourish your body. Tian’er and I are Heavenly Gods - the energy from our negative emotions is much stronger and more powerful than that of ordinary human beings. And since what you said is true, in that case, all you had to do was to kill us immediately after our arrival, then everything would go according to your plan. If so, why are you still wasting so much time and effort talking to us? The only explanation is that, due to the serious damages you are currently suffering, you do not have absolute confidence in killing us. I am right, aren’t I?”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-306-2","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
