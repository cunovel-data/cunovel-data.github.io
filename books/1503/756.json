When he saw the tears streaming down her face but that stubborn look remain in her eyes, his heart instantly softened. “Hanyue, it was all a misunderstanding. This was all my fault, but I never suspected you personally, I just thought that Xuantian Palace was going to do something bad to Bing’er. No matter what, it was all my fault.” Daring to admit fault was one of Zhou Weiqing’s exemplary personal traits. Sometimes, there were many problems between a man and a woman which were caused by both sides being stubborn and hard-headed. If one side could voluntarily admit fault, even the most serious of disputes would be easily resolved. But of course, this was only if both truly loved each other. When Dongfang Hanyue saw that sincere look on Zhou Weiqing’s face, she suddenly leapt forwards and threw herself into his arms, sobbing loudly. She wasn’t crying because he apologized, she was crying because after today, she probably would never see him again. She couldn’t bear to let him go! His arms around Hanyue’s smooth and supple frame, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but feel excited. He couldn’t help but blurt out, “Yue-yue, come with me.” Dongfang Hanyue continued to cry without stopping, unable to reply right away. She was very happy that Zhou Weiqing had said these words, but… could she actually leave? She bore far too many burdens on her shoulders. The entire Xuantian Palace needed her! Thus, after hearing Zhou Weiqing’s sincere invitation, she only cried all the harder, using her hands to pound against Zhou Weiqing’s chest. As for the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, it was extremely uncomfortable due to the two Dragon Emperors staring at it. It said tentatively to Hui Yao, “If you are willing, you can rest a while at my place. It seems this was all nothing more than a misunderstanding.” Hui Yao glance calmly at it, then said, “We’ll just stay here. We wouldn’t want to disturb your rest or cultivation. Since this was all a misunderstanding, everything will be fine once all has been explained. We’ll be leaving soon. I don’t think this place is the Boundless Mainland.” The Tenebrous Demon Dragon secretly let out a sigh of relief. It was better if the two didn’t come to its place. These two were capable of summoning an overwhelming amount of Fire Attribute atmospheric energies, while his own residence was filled with Tenebrous energies. If they actually came to visit, it would probably take him forever to restore his lair to its usual appearance. The only reason it had extended the offer was to demonstrate its sincerity. “Yes, this place is the Xuantian Continent. We’re tens of thousands of kilometers away from the Boundless Mainland,” the Tenebrous Demon Dragon said respectfully. A flicker of deep concern appeared within Hui Yao’s eyes. When Zhou Weiqing had summoned them, they had been filled with excitement as they were finally going to return to the outside world and wouldn’t need to destroy the Luster Spatial Realm. That was a place their ancestors had established, after all. If they could avoid destroying it, that would be ideal. But, after a few brief moments of excitement, they became filled with concern for their children as well as towards that nameless, powerful enemy. Even if they were able to find that opponent, would they be able to bring their children back safely? Zhou Weiqing caressed Dongfang Hanyue’s back. He said softly, “Stop crying, Hanyue. My heart breaks when I see you cry. I don’t want to part from you either! But… just like you, I bear many burdens and responsibilities. I need to go back to save my parents, and there are many other tasks I have to accomplish as well. I want to stay behind with you, but I…” “Say no more.” Dongfang Hanyue lifted up her head, staring at Zhou Weiqing with her reddened eyes. “I just want to ask you one thing. Once everything is settled, will you come back for me?” When he saw that stubborn, hopeful look in her eyes, he didn’t hesitate in saying, “Absolutely! Of course I will! Anywhere between five and ten years from now, I’ll come back here and find you. Not only am I going to come and seek you out, I’m going to take you away. I’m confident that by then, no one in the Xuantian Continent will be able to stop me. I’ll take you away, even if I have to kidnap you to do so.” Zhou Weiqing’s words were extremely dominating. Dongfang Hanyue’s heartbroken face finally revealed a hint of happiness. “Really? Don’t lie to me. Otherwise, I’m going to lead Xuantian Palace in attacking your Boundless Mainland.” Zhou Weiqing laughed bitterly, “My strongest point is also my weakest point. I’m soft-hearted! Especially towards my women. Don’t worry, I’ll do what I promised.” Dongfang Hanyue nodded slowly. “I’ll wait for you. Five years, ten years… even twenty years or longer, I’ll wait for you. No. If you don’t come back to me in ten years, I’ll assume you are dead. I’ll personally lead all the powerhouses of Xuantian Palace to the Boundless Mainland to avenge you.” Zhou Weiqing’s heart trembled. When he saw that stubborn look in her eyes, he grew all the more reluctant to part with her. Even though they had only been together briefly, he could tell from her eyes that she cared just as deeply for him as any of his women did. This was a woman who was worthy of his love! “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely stay alive. For your sake, and for the sake of my wives, I’ll definitely stay alive.” Dongfang Hanyue snorted. “I heard from Bing’er that you are a total lecher. Hmph. I’m the last one, you hear me? Otherwise, once you bring me back I’ll kill the extras that came after me. Five to ten years! I might be able to become a Heavenly God by then. I’m not kidding around with you.” “I wouldn’t dare. I really wouldn’t.” Zhou Weiqing scratched his head. I don’t even know how I’m supposed to explain you to the others when I get back. It seemed he really would have to keep himself under control in the future. No matter how beautiful the women he met were, he would keep a respectable distance from them. Otherwise, these women would eventually tear him limb from limb! When she saw Zhou Weiqing nodded his head obediently like a scolded child, Dongfang Hanyue couldn’t help but let out a giggle. The next moment, tears once more began to cascade down from her beautiful eyes. “G-go on. Beat it. I’m afraid that if you don’t leave right away, I won’t be willing to let you leave at all.” Dongfang Hanyue cast him a final lingering glance, then slowly turned with her back facing him. She didn’t want to watch him leave. Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath, just barely able to control his emotions. He gritted his teeth, then stepped forward to pull Dongfang Hanyue over towards him, planting a deep kiss on her lips which completely melted her. Silver light flashed. A heartbeat later, Zhou Weiqing appeared in the distant skies, landing on Hui Yao’s head once more. “Let’s go.” Hui Yao and Duo Si exchanged a glance, then simultaneously spread their enormous wings and soared into the skies, flying far away. Dongfang Hanyue watched them leave, a lost look in her eyes. “Weiqing, you have to come back! I’ll wait for you.” Zhou Weiqing stood on Hui Yao’s head, unable to control his emotions for a long time. Shangguan Bing’er stood off to one side, not disturbing him. She was a truly good girl who would always be considerate of the feelings of others. She could clearly sense how much it had hurt Dongfang Hanyue to part with him. Hadn’t she felt the same way when she parted with her Little Fatty? Hui Yao and its wife flew westwards. Their movements seemed very slow, but in reality they were travelling incredibly fast. It had taken Zhou Weiqing two full days of flying to reach Xuantian Citadel, but it took them just a few hours on the way back before they saw the sea once more. Hui Yao retracted its wings slightly, allowing its ponderous bulk to descend upon the ocean. “Weiqing, why did you come to the Xuantian Continent? If at all possible, Duo Si and I would like to avoid flying through the skies above the ocean. The Water Attribute atmospheric energies above the ocean are extremely dense, which is not good for our cultivation. In addition, if we were to fly through the skies of the ocean, the marine life below would be heavily impacted by us. Some might be so terrified that they’ll die on the spot. I do not wish to see this.” Zhou Weiqing had finally recovered. He thought for a moment, then said, “We do have a way back which is fairly fast, but… what should we do with the two of you? Your bodies are so huge…” Hui Yao smiled. “You don’t need to worry about that. Have you forgotten the Spatial Teleportation Gem? We can temporarily reside within it and slumber. If you need anything, you can summon us out as you please. That gem doesn’t seem to stable, so I’ll make use of the time to fix and remake it. Otherwise, this priceless treasure will be useless after a few more activations.” Zhou Weiqing chortled. “That’s perfect. Very well then, I’ll put you two inside.” While speaking, he flicked his wrist and sent the Sea Emperor Shuttle flying out to land within the ocean, its ‘lid’ opening up. Just as Hui Yao had said, if the two of them were to fly across the sea it would cause the waters below them to turn a faint red color. Their natural, dense aura of Fire Attribute energy had already caused countless fish to die and come floating up to the surface, completely cooked. No wonder Hui Yao was unwilling to fly across the sea. Even creatures as mighty as dragons were unwilling to commit too much pointless killings. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er entered the Sea Emperor Shuttle. Hui Yao exchanged a glance with its wife. The thick red aura suddenly vanished around them as their giant bodies transformed into two streaks of fiery light that shot into the Spatial Teleportation Gem over Zhou Weiqing’s chest. It felt like an absolutely enormous amount of energy had just poured into it. Before Zhou Weiqing even had a chance to get a clear picture of the energies involved, Hui Yao and Duo Si both completely vanished. As they vanished, the world around them went back to normal and no more red color appeared in the seas. Zhou Weiqing closed the lid to the Sea Emperor Shuttle, then turned over to look at Shangguan Bing’er. It had been nearly a year since the two had come out on this expedition. They had finally completed their mission. It was time to come home. Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing’er’s slender hand, then said in a piteous way, “Bing’er, I know that I was at fault. I was wrong. I swear, she’ll be the last one. I’ll never touch another woman again, ever. Alright?” Shangguan Bing’er let out a soft sigh. “Just keep control of yourself. Little Fatty, I just want to tell you that there are far, far too many wonderful women in the world. You can’t make all of them yours. I can forgive you… but back home are my two sisters and Tian’er, and also that Little Witch who sacrificed herself to rescue you.” Zhou Weiqing scratched his head. “I know, I know. It’s all my fault. This time, when I go back, if I get into another relationship with any other women, you can go ahead and castrate me. I won’t voice a word of complaint.” Shangguan Bing’er let out a startled laugh. “You said it. Don’t go back on your word.” “Uh… can I take it back? And besides, could you really bear to?” Zhou Weiqing chortled naughtily. Shangguan Bing’er snorted. “Why wouldn’t I? All you ever do is bully us.” Zhou Weiqing pulled her into his arms. “You can’t call this ‘bullying’. The term for it is ‘love’. See, its been ages since I’ve loved you. I feel as though you are a stranger. Let me see if my Bing’er was mistreated recently in Xuantian Palace. Let’s see if you’ve grown thinner…” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-256-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis] In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
