{"id":52066,"no":892,"title":"Chapter 304 - Zhou Weiqing, the Core of the Seal! (2)","content":"The golden light lowered and landed in the middle of Hui Yao’s head. The light gradually became weaker and a golden crown appeared on top of Hui Yao’s head before it transformed into a golden energy that gradually entered Hui Yao’s head.\\n\\n This was the Dragon Emperor’s legacy. It would only be passed down to the new emperor just before the older Dragon Emperor passed on, and this was the process of it.\\n\\n After the Dragon Emperor completed the process, the light in his eyes had noticeably become dimmer, and huge amounts of fresh blood continued to gush out of his body. The entire seal on the ground had been tainted with his blood.\\n\\n “Weiqing.” The Dragon Emperor no longer looked at Hui Yao. There was so much he wanted to say to his descendant! However, he was running out of time. In his eyes, the Mainland’s calamity was a lot more important than ensuring the continuity of the Dragon Tribe.\\n\\n “Elder Dragon Emperor,” said Zhou Weiqing with great respect. He had fully activated his Saint Energy, and had completely established a connection with the twelve Divine Beasts. These Divine Beasts were recuperating at an alarming speed.\\n\\n However, Zhou Weiqing was not the Dragon Emperor after all. Even though he possessed a massive amount of Saint Energy, and his cultivation base might be more powerful than the Dragon Emperor, he knew nothing about the seal of the Netherworld’s formation. He did not know how to control and activate it again.\\n\\n The Dragon Emperor said in a deep voice, “From now on, everyone has to follow Zhou Weiqing’s orders. After I’m gone, you have to show the same amount of respect towards Zhou Weiqing, as you did towards me. Or else I will not rest in peace even when I’m in another world. Do all of you understand?”\\n\\n Even though he was already on the brink of death and was in the final moments of his life, the moment the Dragon Emperor exerted his might, all the Divine Beasts lowered their heads simultaneously. This was the prestige of an emperor.\\n\\n The eyes of the Divine Beasts had turned red; a majority of them were shedding tears. They had spent thousands of years with the Dragon Emperor. In their eyes, the Dragon Emperor was like a teacher to them, or even a father figure. Amongst these Divine Beasts, apart from the new addition of Hui Yao and his wife, almost every single one of them were subdued or rescued by the Dragon Emperor - they had willingly served him thereafter. Every single one of them had a strong admiration towards the Dragon Emperor, as well as faith in him.\\n\\n Hearing the Dragon Emperor’s words, most of the Divine Beasts could not help but choke with tears and cried out loud. For a moment, the entire cave was filled with a sorrowful atmosphere.\\n\\n “Do you understand what I’ve just said?” asked the Dragon Emperor in a deep voice.\\n\\n “Yes, Your Majesty.” Every single one of the Divine Beasts answered the Dragon Emperor with a voice that sounded almost like a sad cry.\\n\\n The Dragon Emperor nodded and continued speaking to Zhou Weiqing, “Weiqing, I do not have much time left. From now on, you shall do as I say. With your Saint Energy it is absolutely possible for you to restore the seal and complete it perfectly. Alright, let us begin.”\\n\\n As he spoke, the Dragon Emperor’s gaze became solemn. On the surface he looked like a normal, healthy elder - there was still a strong air of prestige surrounding his body. He did not seem like he was on the brink of death at all.\\n\\n “This formation was created by the former Sidhe Empress and me at that time. There were only six other Divine Beasts who assisted me. However, presently, we are only left with three out of the six original Divine Beasts. I will not give unnecessary explanations about the principle and structure of the formation - all you have to do is activate it. The entire formation has been tainted with my blood, and hence, the original bloodline that had been destroyed by the Lord of the Nether earlier on has been restored. Next, all you have to do is to complete the connection between the formation and all the Divine Beasts. As for you, you will be the core of the entire seal’s formation.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing listened in silence. As the Dragon Emperor continued speaking, his voice began to become weaker and weaker. Evidently, he was going to leave this world at any moment.\\n\\n “The core of the seal is where I’m currently at, which is also the area that was destroyed by the Lord of the Nether earlier on. After I die it will be vacant. Right now, you have to divide your will into twelve parts and completely relax your mind, before you complete the connection with the Divine Beasts. Thereafter, you will guide their energy, channeling it into your body, with yourself as the core and root, and transform their energy into your Saint Energy before shooting it towards my position, which is also the center of the formation. The entire formation will be activated after that. The process is not complicated. I can sense that you possess the same dragon monarch bloodline as the Dragon Tribe. Before I die, I will enhance the dragon monarch bloodline in your body. In that way, the formation will acknowledge you as the new leader. Quick, let us begin. I can’t hold for much longer.”\\n\\n As he spoke, the Dragon Emperor’s massive body started trembling violently. Streaks of Destructive Energy continuously appeared from his body. Evidently, his body could not suppress the Lord of the Nether for much longer.\\n\\n Naturally, the Lord of the Nether had sensed what the Dragon Emperor was doing. Although it would take time and a massive amount of energy to restore the seal, once the seal was truly restored he would no longer have any opportunity to escape. Hence, he could not care any less about exhausting his entire powerful original Destructive Energy and used it to attack the Dragon Emperor directly in a bid to destroy the Dragon Emperor’s body, that was acting as intermediary of the seal, before killing off Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er first.\\n\\n However, the Dragon Emperor had already decided to sacrifice his life. Even if the Lord of the Nether attacked him at full force, it was not that easy for him to thoroughly destroy the Dragon Emperor. After all, they had fought each other for way too long - the Dragon Emperor had a good understanding of the Lord of the Nether. Furthermore, it had gotten used to the Destructive Energy after such a long period of time, coupled with the fact that the Dragon Emperor’s Fire Attribute Energy that was already at its maximum strength. It was currently burning his life force, as well as his Max Level Heavenly God Stage Dragon Emperor Nucleus Core, firmly enclosing the Lord of the Nether within it. As long as the Dragon Emperor’s life force had not been fully combusted, it was impossible for the Lord of the Nether to break the seal.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing dared not be careless. His gaze became focused and his powerful will started spreading out. He was very witty, he did not directly split his will into twelve parts. He wanted to connect with the twelve great Divine Beasts, and every single one of their will was extremely powerful, even surpassing that of Zhou Weiqing’s. Most importantly, Zhou Weiqing was not familiar with the formation. If he failed to establish the connection, he might not have enough time to attempt it again.\\n\\n Hence, Zhou Weiqing had divided his will into two, releasing them at the same time towards Hui Yao and Duo Si.\\n\\n The two dragons were the closest to Zhou Weiqing - they had known each other for a long time, hence they had a good understanding of each other’s auras. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing possessed the dragon monarch bloodline within his body, it was not a problem for him to establish a connection with their will.\\n\\n Hence, Zhou Weiqing made a decision as such. Very quickly, his will had come into contact with Hui Yao and Duo Si.\\n\\n Immediately, Zhou Weiqing could feel two waves of boundless will flowing out from them. The will was very gentle - there was no conflict between their wills, contrary to what he predicted. On the other hand, when Hui Yao and his wife had sensed Zhou Weiqing’s will, the connection between them had been established immediately. Albeit vaguely, two faint rays of golden light were released from the center of Hui Yao and Duo Si’s head. Akin to two silk threads, they headed towards Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing used his will to guide their will towards his body and connected them. The moment their two strands of will connected with his, a dazzling ball of red light lit up on the seal’s formation below them immediately.\\n\\n In a split second, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body experienced an extremely strange feeling that was difficult to describe with words. At this moment, he felt that his senses and perceptions were doubly amplified.\\n\\n The feeling was not only limited to the macroscopic aspect; it included the microscopic aspect as well. Everything in the surroundings became very clear. The will belonging to an individual who possessed the dragon monarch energy, Destructive Energy, as well as the energy of several Divine Beasts combined together would be suppressed to a certain extent. However, after connecting his will to the wills of the two dragons, ZHou Weiqing immediately noticed that his will had been amplified instead - it was able to sense everything in the surroundings a lot more clearly than before. He was able to envelop the entire area surrounding the formation with the energy of his will.\\n\\n On top of that, a few more things, pertaining to the formation, appeared within his will. He had developed a sort of strange understanding with regards to the entire formation - it was as though he had comprehended a lot of things in almost a split second.\\n\\n It was that marvelous, huh?\\n\\n At this moment, there were some movements on the Dragon Emperor’s side. He opened his huge mouth and a ball of blood red light spat out from it, before heading towards Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n The moment Zhou Weiqing’s will had connected with Hui Yao and his wife’s wills, the blood red energy had already appeared in front of him, directly colliding into the Saint God Core Nucleus on Zhou Weiqing’s chest.\\n\\n Immediately, a red-hot feeling that was hard to describe started spreading throughout Zhou Weiqing’s entire body in an instant. At that moment he felt as though the Saint Energy within his body, as well as his soul, was boiling. However, it was not agonizing. Instead, it elicited a strong comfortable and warm feeling. It was as though his entire body was submerged within a hot spring - the pores all over his body had opened up, avariciously absorbing the energy that made him feel extremely comfortable.\\n\\n A gentle light appeared within the Dragon Emperor’s eyes. He slowly closed his eyes; the last thing he wanted to do before he left was to pray. He wanted to pray for the success of the seal, and that all his efforts had not gone to waste.\\n\\n The red ball of light that he had just released was the original Dragon Phoenix Energy. Similar to the Lord of the Nether’s original Destructive Energy, it was his most basic and purest energy.\\n\\n Even though the Dragon Emperor was a Max Level Heavenly God powerhouse himself, and hence was unable to be on par with the Lord of the Nether, who was at the Heavenly Change Stage, the might of his Dragon Emperor’s original energy was rather intimidating.\\n\\n If he had a choice, without any hesitation, the Dragon Emperor would have chosen to channel that energy to his successor, the next Dragon Emperor, Hui Yao.\\n\\n If that was the case, within ten years at most, Hui Yao would be able to possess the same powerful cultivation base as he did in his prime.\\n\\n However, presently, the Dragon Emperor did not have a choice. The person who replaced him as the core of the seal of the Netherworld was not Hui Yao, but Zhou Weiqing. In order to allow Zhou Weiqing to be able to activate the entire formation, he had no choice but to channel his Dragon Emperor’s original energy into Zhou Weiqing’s body. Only by doing so would the formation then be able to be activated without the possibility of any rejection.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-304-2","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
