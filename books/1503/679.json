(3)\n Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er directly sat down where they were in a meditative position, knees facing each other as their hands met. The large Saint Energy whirlpool formed and began to spin.\n The fireball from the mother dragon earlier had dealt a pretty serious blow to Zhou Weiqing, and even his tough meridian channels had been damaged in several areas. Luckily, the large Saint Energy whirlpool had been able to take care of most of the fire attribute energies earlier, otherwise his body might have broken down long since.\n Currently, as the pair sat down cultivating, Zhou Weiqing’s first priority was to nurse himself back to health, at the same time circulating the Saint Energy to recover their strength.\n The three Shangguan Sisters also sat down by their side. With the mother dragon here, unless that rift she spoke about appeared again, they would not be in any danger in this place.\n Zhou Weiqing had the bloodline of the dragons and the Dark Demon God Tiger, and his regeneration and recovery rate was so strong that it was more than comparable to the dragon tribes. Very quickly, his meridian channels were all repaired, and the energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points were also spinning at maximum speed, drawing in Heavenly Energy and replenishing his drained self. With the large Saint Energy whirlpool, Zhou Weiqing was able to gather the scattered Saint Energy in his body, returning it back to his personal Saint Energy whirlpool.\n Although the Saint Energy was undoubtedly strong, against absolute power it was still not able to overcome it to victory. Just like earlier, the massive fireball had scattered most of his Saint Energy. Luckily, a lot of it was still scattered into his body, and one of the unique characteristics of the Saint Energy was it would protect its user. Currently, with Zhou Weiqing’s circulation, the silver white Saint Energy began to flow through his body like the flow of a stream, gathering back at his DanTian as Zhou Weiqing began to resume calculating his total amount.\n Ever since he entered the Lustre Spatial Realm, Zhou Weiqing had Devoured at least three thousand drops of Saint Energy or so. Those fire dragons made from Fire Spirits were definitely a great nourishment to his Saint Energy, but the next two fights also forced him to use a large amount of Saint Energy. Currently, as he consolidated them together, he realised the remaining amount was really not much.\n Even so, if it was compared to the amount that both he and Tian’er had before they entered the Lustre Spatial Realm, it was not a small increase. In the end, Zhou Weiqing found he had around five hundred drops of Saint Energy left in his DanTian, but in the previous process, a small portion of Saint Energy had already merged into his Death Acupuncture Point energy whirlpools, so the benefits he had received was definitely not to be underestimated.\n A heavy Heavenly Energy reverberation raced through his body, and to Zhou Weiqing’s surprise, his Heavenly Energy cultivation level seemed to have a decent rise as well, almost on the verge of breaking through once more as his twenty seventh Death Acupuncture Point seemed to be loosening.\n The surprise was because he had just broken through the twenty sixth Death Acupuncture Point not long ago, perhaps not even ten days ago… yet, he was now on the verge of breaking through again. That was truly inconceivable.\n It was clear that this was the benefit of the Saint Energy and his Devour Skill. The Devour Skill had not only helped the large Saint Energy whirlpool to gain so much Saint Energy, it hd also drawn in a large amount of Heavenly Energy into his body, greatly increasing his Heavenly Energy cultivation level. The Saint Energy would in turn help purify the Heavenly Energy and prevent any side effects from drawing too much Heavenly Energy in such a short time, able to fully use it to purely increase his strength.\n This was just too fast right? While Zhou Weiqing was so pleasantly surprised, he was also extremely satisfied. The twenty seventh Death Acupuncture Point was also the last Death Acupuncture Point of the third portion of the Immortal Deity Technique, and though he would still be at the sixth Jeweled stage after this last Acupuncture Point, by completing this third stage of the Immortal Deity Technique, it would still advance his power a whole step forward. Not only would the speed of regeneration of his Heavenly Energy increase, his Immortal Deity Shield would also grow greatly in strength. Overall, this was definitely a good thing.\n In truth, it was actually normal that Zhou Weiqing would be about to breakthrough. The fire dragons formed by the Fire Spirits were of the purest of Fire Attribute energies. Such a pure Fire Attribute energy was equivalent to the fire energy in the Dragons’ bodies. More importantly, as Zhou Weiqing had infused so much Saint Energy into the Devour Skill, it had greatly improved it, turning all of the fire dragons back into Saint Energy. All of that Saint Energy had temporarily mixed with his Heavenly Energy, and with the enrichment, his Heavenly Energy had actually gone through a qualitative change… and thus breaking through to the next stage was like a canal forming when water flows[1. Literal translation, basically means success will come automatically when conditions are ripe].\n It could be said that Zhou Weiqing had totally profitted from that previous misfortune, but it was also the Demonic Attribute’s Devour Skill once again showing its extraordinary power again.\n Just like the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set that Zhou Weiqing had, the greater one’s cultivation stage, the greater the boost it would give.\n Tian’er could naturally sense the changes in Zhou Weiqing’s body immediately. While she was still pleasantly surprised, Zhou Weiqing had already begun slowly infusing the Saint Energy into Tian’er’s body, helping her enrich and improve her body as well.\n However, this time both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er felt their cultivation had gone through some changes. They discovered that with the large Saint Energy whirlpool’s movement, their own personal small Saint Energy whirlpool was also affected to spin along, and the five hundred drops of Saint Energy were no longer divided equally between the two of them, instead forming a full circulation between all three Saint Energy whirlpools across their bodies. Not only was it slowly recovering their Saint Energy, but also enriching and improving their bodies at the same time.\n The reason such a situation was happening was simple, the massive gain in their overall amount of Saint Energy previously.\n In the past, when their Saint Energy had broken past the hundred drop stage, the connection between them and the Saint Energy had changed. This had happened again when they reached three hundred drops. Previously, the highest amount of Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing’s body had already gone past two thousand drops, and it was natural that a similar occurrence had already happened, though he had not previously noticed it.\n At the side, the three Shangguan Sisters could clearly see that both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s bodies were slowly turning a silver-white colour as they continued cultivating. The energy in the air was obviously growing thicker, and the Saint Energy aura that they were giving off gave them all a comfortable feeling, even the mother dragon was no exception.\n The three Shangguan Sisters could sense that this was extremely beneficial to them as well, and they instantly began their own cultivation at the side as well. Feeling the aura of the Saint Energy around them, the Heavenly Energy in their bodies was clearly more energetic and reactive than usual.\n The mother dragon looked at Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, her eyes filled with surprise. Originally, she did not have a lot of hope within her regarding the success of them reviving her husband.\n After all, the difference in power levels was just too huge.\n It still had some understanding regarding the Resurrect Skill of the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger. Ordinarily speaking, if the person using the Skill had a far higher cultivation level than the target, the chances of success would be much higher, but the reverse was also true. However, Tian’er’s current cultivation was only at the seven-Jeweled stage, but her husband was a Heavenly God Tier stage, one far more powerful than ordinary as well. One could just imagine what the chances of success for the revival would be… but no matter what, she still hoped to try, even if there was just a slim chance of success, she was not willing to give up!\n However, right at this moment, as she sensed the Saint Energy aura coming from Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, she suddenly thought back on how Zhou Weiqing had actually blocked her attack previously. That should never have been possible for someone of their power level! Slowly, the mother dragon’s heart began to heat up fervently… perhaps, they would really have a chance to succeed in reviving her husband! If that power that had killed her husband could be said to be full of the aura of destruction, then the current aura that these two youths were giving out was full of the power of creation.\n They could succeed, they definitely could! The mother dragon just lay there, slowly closing her eyes, praying for them.\n Ever since her husband had been killed, this was the first time she had really calmed down. A powerful sense of exhaustion overwhelmed her, and she actually fell into a deep sleep.\n Although her wounds were relatively recovered, the crazy frenzy of her past weeks had taken a massive toll on the mother dragon’s body as well. She did not resist the sleep, as it was the best way for any dragon to recover. She knew that when the time came to revive her husband, it was highly likely that they would need her help, and the only way she could increase the chances of success was for herself to recover and be in tip top condition.\n ...\n Time passed swiftly, especially when lost in cultivation.\n The three Shangguan Sisters had already woken up and returned to cultivation several times over, each time they only ate and drank a little before resuming cultivation.\n Bathed in the aura of the Saint Energy, their cultivation speed was far beyond their usual speed, even compared to being in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace where the concentration of atmospheric energy was far higher. This was especially so since all three girls had been infused with Saint Energy by Zhou Weiqing previously, and it worked as a great primer for them, allowing them to accept the aid of the Saint Energy around them at a greater rate. This allowed their cultivation to grow at a much faster rate without sacrificing stability, improving all this time. Such a chance was not easy to come by for anyone.\n As for Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, they had entered a deep, profound mysterious state, not even needing to eat or drink, totally unknowing of the time around them.\n The silver white Saint Energy traveled to every single corner of their bodies, enriching them. In the first day of cultivation, Zhou Weiqing had already broken through the twenty seventh Death Acupuncture Point, bringing his cultivation stage one higher. However, it had not ended there, and with the fresh circulation of the Saint Energy, their Saint Energy was actually increasing continuously at a rapid pace, much faster than their previous cultivation speed had been. It was only until the total Saint Energy between the two had reached over a thousand drops that the speed finally slowed down.\n As compared to previously, both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s meridian channels were now all covered with a layer of faint silver white light. Their bodies had been improved and reconstructed by the Saint Energy, as if their world had been turned upside down, and their cultivation levels had improved greatly as well.\n The atmospheric energy in the Lustre Spatial Realm had always been higher than the outside world; after all this was a place for the dragons to live, and was also the core area of the Heavenly Jewel Island. It could be said that the sheer concentration of atmospheric energy in the Heavenly Jewel Island arose from the Lustre Spatial Realm, and it was through several powerful formations that drew in the atmospheric energy that the Lustre Spatial Realm could last until now. As such, as they cultivated here, they did not have to worry about atmospheric energy running out.\n When they had entered the Lustre Spatial Realm, they had brought with them thirty days worth of food and water in the Spatial Ring that the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had provided. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er were not eating or drinking at all, and thus the group of them could easily last a long time here. Furthermore, since they were all cultivating, during that process, they would be enriched by the atmospheric energies, and even the three Shangguan Sisters only needed very little sustenance every day.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-24-chapter-229-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
