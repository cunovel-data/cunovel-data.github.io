He could also sense Shangguan Bing’er’s anxiety, and immediately Received his Heavenly Jewels.\\n\\n On hearing Huyan Aobo words, Shangguan Bing’er’s look of wariness lessened a little, and she said: “Senior, what do you mean?”\\n\\n Huyan Aobo sighed and said: “To be honest, this is the sorrowful fate for us Consolidating Equipment Masters. You should know that Consolidating Equipment Masters need to have the Spatial Attribute, no matter Heavenly Jewel Masters or just Elemental Jewel Masters, as long as you have the Spatial Attribute, you have the possibility of becoming a Consolidating Equipment Master. However, amongst the four Greater Attributes, Darkness, Light, Life and Spatial Attributes, the rarest is the Spatial Attribute. This is especially true for Spatial Attribute Heavenly Jewel Masters, they are incomparably rare. Therefore, currently most of the Consolidating Equipment Masters are just Spatial Attribute Elemental Jewel Masters. It is difficult to find a Spatial Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master to choose to become a Consolidating Equipment Master.”\\n\\n After pausing a while, Huyan Aobo continued saying: “I can tell you two a secret. The rank of us Consolidating Equipment Masters is dependant on the success rate of our Consolidating Equipment Scrolls as well as the quality of our Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Most lower ranking Consolidating Equipment Masters have their Consolidating Equipment Scrolls with success rates less than 1/1000. As such, there are few who are willing to join this profession. Even the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls that I, this grandmaster Consolidating Equipment Master manufactures, the success rate is also only 1%. This is the limit of my achievement. Only Heavenly Jewel Masters who have become Consolidating Equipment Masters have the possibility of becoming more formidable Consolidating Equipment Masters, perhaps even reaching god level. That had been the biggest dream in my life, a dream that I know I can no longer complete, but I have more than enough theoretical knowledge, so I hope that my future disciple can complete this dream for me.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said doubtfully: “Are you trying to recruit me as a disciple?”\\n\\n Huyan Aobo’s face grew somewhat awkward, “That’s the awkward difference between us Consolidating Equipment Masters and other professions. Other professions, the disciple looks for the master, while us masters have to look for our disciples. The Spatial Attribute Heavenly Jewel Masters are just too rare. Look, you guys do not appear to have much money; to be honest, Spatial Attribute Heavenly Jewel Masters who are so broke are even more rare. Little brother, as long as you are willing to apprentice under me and inherit my skills, the price of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls are open for discussion. Not only do you not need 500,000 gold coins, I’ll sell it to you for 150,000 gold coins, the exact amount you have?”\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er loosened her grip on Zhou Weiqing’s hand, as she was lost in thought. Huyan Aobo words made her excited, after all you must know that in the entire Heavenly Bow Empire there was not a single Consolidating Equipment Master. Although Huyan Aobo was greedy for money and extremely stingy, but in the Consolidating Equipment Master domain, he could be said to be an existence of high authoritative level. In the entire Fei Li Empire, there were few Consolidating Equipment Masters that could be said to be better than him. If Zhou Weiqing studied how to create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls with him, it would be of incomparable advantage to the Heavenly Bow Empire‘s future.\\n\\n “No way.” Zhou Weiqing had already rejected Huyan Aobo invitation without hesitation. He was currently full of anger at this moment, facing Huyan AoBo who had been so haughty towards him earlier, how could he easily agree to his terms.\\n\\n Huyan Aobo started breathing heavily, “Little brat… no, Little brother, don’t you know how rich Consolidating Equipment Masters are? Although we have to sacrifice cultivation time to manufacture Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, but, we are also the richest and most highly respected. How about this, this Overlord Bow Scroll, I will sell it at rock-bottom price to you, 100,000 gold coins, how about that?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing gave a humph, “I have never heard of a master who did not give his apprentice a gift on the first meeting, and instead asking for money. You are truly a stingy and miserly person! If you become my master, can I have live out any good days? I’m not doing it!”\\n\\n Just a moment ago, Huyan Aobo had raised his price proudly, at this moment, Zhou Weiqing was doing the same in return. Indeed, it was an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\\n\\n Feng Yu was cheerfully laughing at the side, he normally witnessed many people who had no choice but to admit defeat in front of Huyan Aobo, this was the first time he saw that old man admitting defeat.\\n\\n Huyan Aobo rubbed his hands together, his face a mask of pain, “Alright, alright. As long as you become my disciple, I will give you this Overlord Bow Scroll okay.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing was extremely astute, and understood immediately that this was definitely not Huyan AoBo’s limit. The anger that was on his face had long disappeared after Huyan Aobo mentioned giving him the scroll. With a simple, honest and sincere look on his face, he continued saying “Senior, I thank you for your good intentions. However, cultivation of Heavenly Jewel Masters is extremely expensive as you know, and my fiance and I come from commoner families, furthermore we are from the Heavenly Bow Empire. You should know that our Heavenly Bow Empire doesn’t have much financial resources, and they are unable to support us in cultivation. The 150,000 gold coins that my wife brought was all the support that the Heavenly Bow Empire managed to give us to cultivate. It is truly the tip of the iceberg of our needs! I do not mind studying how to create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, but, this must be delayed. It is not so easy to become a Consolidating Equipment Master right? To make money is not something that can be achieved in a short time. I do not know when I can have enough to not just carry out Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment and also Elemental Jewel Skill Storing. We have already decided earlier that we must join the Fei Li Empire’s Skill-Storing Palace. Therefore, I can only decline your good intention with thanks. Sigh… this is really predestiny!”\\n\\n When Shangguan Bing’er heard Huyan Aobo giving Zhou Weiqing the Overlord Bow Scroll for free, she had been struck dumbfounded. That was just a matter of a short period of time! How everything had changed in an instant. Listening to Zhou Weiqing’s words, although she in her heart she hated this rascal for taking advantage of her with his words, she extraordinarily did not say anything to refute him. She was very clear that when this Little Fatty Zhou’s face revealed that sincere simple and honest look, it was his most dreadful, shameless and deceitful time.\\n\\n “No, no, that is not good at all, you cannot join the Skill-Storing Palace. Do you not know that if you join the Skill-Storing Palace, it is tantamount to selling yourself into servitude to the Fei Li Empire?” Upon hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Huyan Aobo grew anxious.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said with a resigned-looking face: “I have no choice! If I have to sells myself into servitude then I’ll have to do it. I’ve heard that Skill-Storing for Elemental Jewels is even more expensive, how can the both of us withstand such expenditure! I think, as long as we do well in the Skill-Storing Palace, they will be more than willing to spend to help us buy the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls that we need. Isn’t that right, wife?”\\n\\n This rascal turned his head to look at Shangguan Bing’er, with his back facing Huyan Aobo and Feng Yu, he winked towards her.\\n\\n Although Shangguan Bing’er was being taken advantage of by this rascal’s words, she had no choice and was unable to undermine him at this time! Glaring at him quickly, she actually had to agree with a “En”.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing looked back once more to Huyan AoBo, “Senior, we shall not disturb you further. That Overlord Bow Scroll you can sell to others. We will be heading to the Skill-Storing Palace first, perhaps in the future we will still have the opportunity to purchase scrolls from you.” Having said that, he pulled on Shangguan Bing’er’s hands and headed out.\\n\\n At this time, Zhou Weiqing was gloating in his mind! Looking at Huyan Aobo’s awkward expression, he felt he had already paid him back for earlier. Furthermore, he had managed to take advantage of Shangguan Bing’er, and even managed to hold her hand, this was just too perfect.\\n\\n “Don’t go, don’t go. Wait, let me think carefully first.” Huyan Aobo paced anxiously back and forth in the room.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-2-chapter-13-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
