(1)\\n\\n With this delay, another two hours passed just like that. At last, the two of them finally activated the Sea Emperor’s Shuttle, speeding off directly into the deep ocean waters. \\n\\n This entire year in the Xuantian Continent could be said to be extremely rewarding for Zhou Weiqing. Not only had he completed his mission, his own cultivation had improved greatly, with his Saint Energy actually reaching the thirty eighth stage, one step closer to his Saint Core Nucleus. Zhou Weiqing could vaguely sense that if he really managed to consolidate the Saint Core Nucleus, his power would rise qualitatively again. Then, perhaps he could even take on Heavenly God Tier powerhouses without being too afraid, let alone Heavenly Emperors. \\n\\n The speed of the Sea Emperor’s Shuttle was already extremely fast, and with Zhou Weiqing infusing as much Saint Energy as it could take, it sped along like a bolt of lightning cutting through the oceans. If they kept up such speeds, Zhou Weiqing estimated that they would take only around two months or so before they could return to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. \\n\\n Very quickly, a day passed, and they submerged the Sea Emperor’s Shuttle deeper into the ocean. \\n\\n Even as Zhou Weiqing was continuously infusing Saint Energy into the Sea Emperor’s Shuttle, abruptly the ocean waters in front of them seemed to undergo a strange change. Since Zhou Weiqing was using his Saint Energy to activate the Sea Emperor’s Shuttle, his senses had been extended out a great distance and with maximum sensitivity, as if the Sea Emperor’s Shuttle was part of his body. At this moment, the entire Sea Emperor’s Shuttle felt as if it had slammed into a giant, invisible net, the powerful constraints causing their speed to slow drastically. \\n\\n When they looked out, everything seemed normal, the ocean waters still as clear and as beautiful as ever. However, the sense of being bound up was just too strong, and as the Sea Emperor Shuttle continued slowing, it actually seemed like it was about to stop. \\n\\n Not Good!\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing cried out inwardly, abruptly bursting forth with as much Saint Energy as he could infuse. In that instant, the Sea Emperor Shuttle exploded with a piercing silver-white light. Instead of moving forward, it began to rise in a wild, meteoric fashion. In a swoosh, it burst free from the ocean waters.\\n\\n Right as they left the ocean, a terrifying huge mouth slammed shut where they had been an instant ago. If Zhou Weiqing had not reacted swiftly enough, they would have been swallowed entirely by those giant jaws.\\n\\n In midair, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er had jumped out of the Sea Emperor Shuttle, swiftly withdrawing it back into his Sumeru Ring. \\n\\n The two of them immediately brought their wings into play, soaring higher into the sky as they focused their vision downwards. \\n\\n Currently, on the surface of the ocean a massive whirlpool of almost thousand metres in diameter had formed. At the same time, a low, venomous voice rang out from that whirlpool. \\n\\n “I never really expected that it would be you. Little brat, this time let’s see who can save you.” \\n\\n A giant, ferocious head slowly poked out of the center of the whirlpool. It was the surviving Terror Sea Dragon that had been wounded by Zhou Weiqing and Dongfang Hanyue. \\n\\n When Zhou Weiqing saw it, he couldn’t help but be stunned momentarily. This fellow was just like a ghost haunting him, always appearing inexorably and seeking vengeance. He had already been pushing the Sea Emperor Shuttle at an extreme speed, yet he had still been intercepted by it. This luck, it was really… \\n\\n If the situation had been similar to their journey to the Xuantian Continent, Zhou Weiqing would definitely not have overlooked this critical detail, possibly taking a long way around. However, this time he was accompanied by the two great Dragons, and thus he had not bothered trying to hide, just taking the most direct route. Who would have imagined that he would really meet this Terror Sea Dragon once more. \\n\\n It had barely been a few days since they had last clashed, but it looked like this fellow had not only recovered fully, it had also become larger and stronger. It seemed like its cultivation had even grown severely. \\n\\n In truth, it was Zhou Weiqing’s own folly in this matter. If he was not using the Sea Emperor Shuttle, in the vast oceans, no matter how powerful the Terror Sea Dragon was, how could it possibly discover them? However, the Sea Emperor Shuttle was after all created using the Heavenly Core of the Terror Sea Dragon’s father, and the aura it gave off was just too familiar to it. How could it possibly not be able to sense it? \\n\\n Suddenly sensing such a familiar presence, this Terror Sea Dragon had naturally rushed over to investigate. As for the reason why its cultivation had risen so suddenly, it was actually not that it had gained some inspiration or benefit in the big fight, but rather because after the fight, although its brother had self-detonated its Heavenly Core Nucleus, it had not fully succeeded. As such, a portion of its Heavenly Core had remained, sinking to the depths of the oceans. Since the ocean was its domain, how could this Terror Sea Dragon not be able to find it? \\n\\n It was exactly because it could depend on the remnants of its brother’s Heavenly Core that it was able to recover in such a short period of time, and improve its cultivation level as well. \\n\\n “It looks like your luck is really not bad at all,” Zhou Weiqing said to Shangguan Bing’er beside him, totally ignoring the Terror Sea Dragon. The only thing he continued to do was soar higher with Bing’er, attempting to draw open the gap between themselves and the Terror Sea Dragon. \\n\\n Currently, Shangguan Bing’er was definitely very nervous. After all, the Terror Sea Dragon was a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, a hegemon over the oceans. Furthermore, its look was so savage and ferocious. \\n\\n “Is that the Terror Sea Dragon?” Shangguan Bing’er asked worriedly. \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Yes, but do not worry. Relax, I will handle it.”\\n\\n Seeing the two young humans continue soaring into the skies, the Terror Sea Dragon was not anxious at all. Its massive body actually sprang out of the waters. Although it did not have wings, with its powerful cultivation, flying in the air was naturally not a problem. \\n\\n In the oceans, its senses and perception were extremely powerful. It had been looking out for Dongfang Hanyue, and it had long realised that this time she was not following Zhou Weiqing. As for the other human beside him, she was even weaker, and it dismissed her at once, not worried at all. \\n\\n The Terror Sea Dragon hated Zhou Weiqing to the core. If it was not able to torture him to death, it would not rest. As for the period of torture, it had decided to lengthen it further. \\n\\n Both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er flew extremely fast, and they soon soared to more than a thousand metre height. The Terror Sea Dragon was following behind them. Currently, the skies were an azure blue as the Water Attribute energies grew stronger all about them, beginning to exert a binding force upon them that grew stronger by the minute, causing their speeds to slow down as time went by. \\n\\n This was actually because the Terror Sea Dragon wanted them to slowly feel fear, bit by bit. After all, Zhou Weiqing was now ‘alone’, and though he had launched a surprisingly strong attack previously, what kind of existence was the Terror Sea Dragon? Naturally, it sensed a temporary eruption of power. This time, not only had it grown stronger, it was also fully prepared, ready to squash Zhou Weiqing like the little bug he was. \\n\\n The terrifying energy reverberations flowed in the sky. At this moment, even Zhou Weiqing was feeling rather nervous. However, this nervousness was not regarding whether or not they could escape from the Terror Sea Dragon, but whether or not they could successfully kill the Terror Sea Dragon before it escaped. \\n\\n “Little brat, today you will not have any other chances. I will tear your skin and break all your bones, letting you die bit by bit. Ohh, it looks like the energy within your body is rather unique, perhaps it will have some use to me. I will definitely have a good meal and digest it properly. Do not bother with your puny resistance any longer.” \\n\\n The pressure from the water attribute energies was steadily increasing, the energy fluctuations growing more violent. In an abrupt increase of power, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er found they were no longer able to continue flying upwards. \\n\\n The Terror Sea Dragon had grown to almost a hundred metres long, and it soared arrogantly in the skies near them. Since it was just Zhou Weiqing, it naturally did not deem it necessary to immerse its body in the oceans. Furthermore, this was in the skies above the oceans, and the Water Attribute energies in the atmosphere was still relatively high. \\n\\n All of a sudden, Zhou Weiqing began to laugh at the Terror Sea Dragon. “Big fellow, do not think you have won like that. This is just the beginning.” \\n\\n Of course, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er were no match for the Terror Sea Dragon. If they took into account the dangers of the oceans, he would not choose such a straight-line fashion to travel back to the Boundless Mainland. However, he was currently so bold because he was now able to rely on others, and his confidence was far greater now, even compared to when he was in the Xuantian Palace. After all, at that time, he did not know if the summons would actually succeed, but now he had no such worries. \\n\\n Two balls of red light swelled out from Zhou Weiqing’s chest. One in the skies, one further below near the ocean. Even the powerful Terror Sea Dragon did not have time to react as the skies began to change colour instantly. \\n\\n In truth, when the Terror Sea Dragon first appeared, Hui Yao had already contacted Zhou Weiqing. With the sudden appearance of a Heavenly God Tier, how could the two dragons not pay attention to it and attach great importance to the matter? Zhou Weiqing luring the Terror Sea Dragon into the skies was actually a suggestion from Hui Yao. He knew that if the Terror Sea Dragon was in the oceans, although they could still easily defeat it, it would still not be easy for them to stop it from escaping. After all, the geographical and attribute advantage was just too obvious. However, once they were all in the skies, the situation would be vastly different. Although it was still above the oceans, the skies were the realm of the Emperor Dragon bloodlines, and how could they all remain arrogant in their domain!\\n\\n When the terrifying red light descended, covered the skies and blanketed the area, the Terror Sea Dragon began to panic. Subconsciously, it began to dive down back for the safety of the ocean. \\n\\n “Back.” Duo Si’s disdainful voice rang out. A violent explosion, and the massive body of the Terror Sea Dragon bounced back upwards. \\n\\n When the red light appeared, a searing hot energy enveloped Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er. In the next moment, both their bodies soared higher into the skies, and they were no longer able to see the situation below clearly. All they could see was an endless sea of red.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-257-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
