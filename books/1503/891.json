Looking at the black light ball that was constantly expanding, a strong sense of crisis appeared within Zhou Weiqing’s heart. He knew for a fact that if that thing were to strike his body, regardless of how powerful his cultivation base was, he would cease to exist in this world forever.\\n\\n He lifted his right leg and kicked directly in the direction of the black ball. Following the completion of the Dragon-Tiger Demon Transformation, Zhou Weiqing’s right leg could no longer transform into a hook-like state. Nonetheless, the terrifying energy had surpassed how it used to be.\\n\\n A simple action of stamping his right foot created a violent sonic boom in the air, as a result of the terrifying energy. A ball of condensed concentrated Saint Energy brazenly charged towards the black ball of Destructive Energy.\\n\\n When the ball of Saint light came into contact with the dark green protective shield, a soft ‘pop’ was heard before the shield broke apart. After all, it was Zhou Weiqing’s extremely condensed and compressed Saint Energy. It was not to be forgotten that the Saint Energy and Destructive Energy were polar opposites. Hence, they had restraining effects on each other. Also, the might of Zhou Weiqing’s full-force attack was extraordinary.\\n\\n After the light shield was broken, the two energy balls, one white and one black, naturally collided in the air. There wasn’t a loud bang - only a hissing sound was heard, as though hot oil was poured on top of an iceberg.\\n\\n Under the shocked gazes of all the powerhouses, the two energy balls had merged into one. However, upon merging, the color of the energy ball was still black. Zhou Weiqing’s ball of Saint light was completely destroyed by the ball of Destructive Energy.\\n\\n “Zhou Weiqing, your Saint Energy is not pure enough to go against my Destructive Energy. Go to hell.” At this moment, the black ball of light had already condensed into a ball with the diameter of approximately one meter. Even the Lord of the Nether himself felt weak at this moment. It was his original source of energy. As he continued to used it, it continued to diminish as well. It would probably take a long time before he was able to accumulate and restore it. Hence, he did not bear to use too much of it. If not for the sake of dealing with Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy, he would not have used this source of energy to launch an attack. He had only used it earlier on when he was trying to break the seal.\\n\\n The Lord of the Nether had to accumulate a certain amount of the original Destructive Energy before he could initiate an attack on the seal. It was also because of this energy that he was able to split the seal open, as well as fatally injure the Dragon Emperor.\\n\\n The ball of Destructive Energy slowly floated in the air, and a ray of black light shot out directly from it, enveloping the space in which Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er were in. In an instant, all the other types of energy got isolated. Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er felt cold from head to toe, however, they did not receive any attacks. Nonetheless, Zhou Weiqing had clearly realized that he had lost all contact with every single energy attribute in the external world, as well as every single law. In other words, he was unable to escape using the Spatial Law even if he wanted to.\\n\\n The Lord of the Nether was extremely unscrupulous. Since he had attacked with full force, he did not intend to give Zhou Weiqing any opportunity at all.\\n\\n At this moment, all of a sudden, everyone could sense the surrounding temperature rising. Additionally, the inner part of the cave had turned into a shade of red. Both Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy and the Lord of the Nether’s Destructive Energy could not conceal the red brilliance.\\n\\n “Lord of the Nether, being sealed forever is the only ending for you. I had already accompanied you for ten thousand years. In that case, let me accompany you for eternity.”\\n\\n An enormous ball of red light descended from above. It was extremely huge to the point that it was terrifying. The most crucial part was that the red energy contained a fire element that was a thousand times stronger than lava. Marked with an unparalleled vigor, as well as a devoted soul, it descended from above and smashed against the Destructive ball of light that was heading towards Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n The sizes of the ball of Destructive Energy and the red mass of light were not directly proportional. However, after they collided, the ball of Destructive Energy had vanished, and at the same time, all of the red light had disappeared from the red mass of light. However, it continued to smash the Lord of the Nether’s pincers at full force.\\n\\n “Forefather……”\\n\\n “Elder Dragon Emperor……”\\n\\n Cries erupted through the air; every single individual’s eyes had turned red almost instantly.\\n\\n Indeed, the enormous red mass of light was none other than the Dragon Emperor. The Dragon Emperor, who possessed boundless prestige and life experiences, had sacrificed his life to defend the dignity of the Dragon Tribe, and to guard the Boundless Mainland.\\n\\n His massive figure forcefully smashed against the Lord of the Nether’s pincers, wrapping his body around them completely. Mouthfuls of dragon blood continuously spurted out of the Dragon Emperor’s mouth, and had splattered onto the seal that was on the ground.\\n\\n “No——” The Lord of the Nether’s voice was filled with panic and hysteria. However, his voice had weakened rapidly; even his Destructive aura was substantially weakened at this moment.\\n\\n Emerald green light descended from above - it came from the Sidhe Empress’ Life Energy. She had channeled almost all her Life Energy into the Dragon Emperor’s body at this moment.\\n\\n “Your Majesty, you don’t have to do this. Reserve your energy to help Weiqing complete the seal once again.” The Dragon Emperor’s eyes were filled with benevolence and gentleness. He had already decided to sacrifice his life when he had made that decision to do what he did.\\n\\n Initially, his injuries were already fatal. However, the Life Energy released by the Sidhe Empress had pulled him back from the brink of death. However, at this moment, how could he allow the Lord of the Nether to kill Zhou Weiqing? The Lord of the Nether knew for a fact that Zhou Weiqing was his biggest threat. Naturally, the Dragon Emperor was well aware of that as well.\\n\\n The Dragon Emperor and the Lord of the Nether had fought against each other throughout their entire lives. He was absolutely unwilling to lose this battle against the Lord of the Nether in the final moment.\\n\\n Hence, he had chosen death - using the final glory of his life to seal off the Lord of the Nether’s escape path. The red light was the end product of the Dragon Emperor burning his Life flame, as well as the Saint fire that was brought about by the dragon monarch’s bloodline. The Fire Attribute Energy that he possessed was extremely massive. Even the Lord of the Nether’s ball of original Destructive Energy was being counteracted after coming into contact with the Dragon Emperor’s full-force attack. His pair of pincers was temporarily sealed by the Dragon Emperor’s huge body.\\n\\n This was the Dragon Emperor’s seal that was created by him sacrificing his life, bloodline, bones, meridians, etc.! Even if the Lord of the Nether was any more powerful, it would still be temporarily sealed with the Dragon Emperor, who was halfway through becoming a God, as his opponent.\\n\\n “Your Majesty, Dragon Emperor! You……” The Sidhe Empress had only spoken a few words before she started choking on her tears and was unable to continue her sentence. In order to seal the Lord of the Nether, the Dragon Emperor had put in an entire lifetime’s worth of effort. It was ten thousand years of loneliness and being solitary! This was not something that could be achieved by an ordinary person.\\n\\n The Dragon Emperor looked at the Sidhe Empress with a gentle gaze and shook his head, “Do not feel sorry for me. I have no regrets dying here, after fighting a worthy battle. We do not have much time left - from now on, all of you must follow my orders.”\\n\\n “Yes, Your Majesty.” Everyone, including Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er and the Sidhe Empress bowed respectively towards the dignified elder, awaiting his orders. At this moment, the Dragon Emperor had reached an unparalleled status within everyone’s hearts.\\n\\n There were very few people who Zhou Weiqing admired in his entire lifetime. Amongst them were his persistent father, his master Long Shiya and Senior Uncle Duan Tianlang; not forgetting the free-spirited unrestrained archers of the Heavenly Bow Unit. However, at this moment, the Dragon Emperor had truly become his idol. He was absolutely certain that no matter how glorious he became in the future, he would never be able to be compared to this respected elder.\\n\\n For the sake of the entire world, the Dragon Emperor had sacrificed ten thousand years’ worth of life. Both him and the Heavenly Beasts, who had helped maintain the seal, were the ones who were the most respectable and admirable in this world! In order to guard the Mainland, they had sacrificed a lot over a long period of time in silence, yet no one knew about it. Even at this moment, the Dragon Emperor had sacrificed his life in order to complete the seal once again.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing was deeply moved by his gesture. At this moment, he had forgotten about his fear of death. He had secretly made up his mind that no matter what, he would definitely seal the Lord of the Nether once again, and that he would never allow him to escape ever again.\\n\\n The Dragon Emperor’s gaze shifted to Hui Yao. Hui Yao and Duo Si’s huge eyes were filled with tears that were flowing down their faces. However, there wasn’t any sorrow in their eyes - only pride. The Dragon Tribe’s pride. The Dragon Emperor had set a good example for them - this was the noble figure of the Dragon Tribe, who had once ruled the entire world! The grief stemming from their children’s tragic death had faded significantly. Compared to the sacrifices made by the Dragon Emperor, their grief was considered as nothing.\\n\\n “Forefather?” Hui Yao’s voice was somewhat trembling.\\n\\n The Dragon Emperor’s eyes gradually became gold in color, “My child, do not grief. Every individual with a living body will die one day. This is the principle of nature and nobody is able to defy it - even for individuals with a long lifespan like us. My friends and I are already approaching the end of our lives; even Phelia, who is the youngest out of all of us, is already six thousand over years old. What more could we ask for? After I die, the responsibility of the Dragon Tribe will be passed on to you. If the seal is able to be completed and all of you are able to leave here alive, go look for our tribe members in this entire world. I don’t have any other responsibilities for you; I simply hope that you will lead our tribe members, and ensure the continuity of the glory of the Dragon Tribe, and not let the Dragon Tribe get exterminated. Can you do that?”\\n\\n “Yes, I can. I assure you that I will use my life and do anything possible to defend the honor and protect the future of the Dragon Tribe,” Hui Yao vowed solemnly.\\n\\n The Dragon Emperor nodded his head in satisfaction, “Alright. From today onwards, you are the new emperor of the Dragon Tribe.” As he spoke, two golden light shot out of his eyes, that had completely become gold in color, and converged in front of Dragon Emperor’s huge head, before transforming into a golden ball of light that floated in the direction of Hui Yao’s head.\\n\\n Hui Yao lowered his head respectfully and waited in silence for the ball of golden light to float over to the top of his head.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-304-1","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
