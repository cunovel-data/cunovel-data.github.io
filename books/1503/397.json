Although the Immortal Deity Shield managed to block off a portion of it, it was shattered almost instantly, and could not block it all.\\n\\n In that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s mind blanked. He suddenly understood something. Although he had so many powerful Skills, managing to defeat so many opponents with greater power than himself, he was still only a Four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master! As long as he was truly hit by an enemy’s powerful Skill, he could not do anything about it. The Immortal Deity Shield and the Demonic Change State gave him a defense that was far beyond any ordinary four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, but there was still a limit, and clearly this was it. All he could do was to focus on his energy whirlpools and circulate them at maximum speed in hopes to just stay alive barely.\\n\\n Will I be disfigured? Bing’er, Tian’er… the beautiful women of the world… I don’t want to be disfigured! Ahhh!!\\n\\n Even at such a time, he could not forget to self ridicule a little, in order to keep himself from falling into a panic; otherwise he would only die faster.\\n\\n However, the pain only lasted for a second, before a strange wave of heat seemed to rise up from within his four limbs, bones and body, spreading outwards, and Zhou Weiqing soon felt as if all the pores on his skin had a strange suction force as the heat continued spreading throughout his body. The next moment, the green-gold flames that had caused him so much pain vanished.\\n\\n Did I somehow absorb it? That was Zhou Weiqing’s feeling right at that moment. It was not from the Devour Skill, but directly absorbed by his skin...\\n\\n Absorbing an attack that was more than sufficient to destroy him totally. What… what was going on?!\\n\\n After a moment of stunned silence, Zhou Weiqing was the first to rise to clear-headedness. His Dragon Silencing Seal had successfully been unleashed, and at this point, how could he be nice. Four Dragon Silencing Seal thrown out unhesitatingly, three to the enemies in front of him, and one for Shen Ji, who had still been restricting him with the Chains of War.\\n\\n As such, when Shangguan Fei’er charged over, that was the first sight that entered her eyes.\\n\\n Shen Ji’s luck was still considered rather good. If Zhou Weiqing’s Dragon Silencing Seal had landed a second earlier, he would have lost his Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills right as Shangguan Fei’er’s attack with the Infinite Saint Flame. If that was so, that blow would likely have taken his life.\\n\\n Luckily for him, Zhou Weiqing’s Dragon Silencing Seal landed a little late, as such he survived.\\n\\n As soon as his Dragon Silencing Seal succeeded, Zhou Weiqing’s body disappeared in a flash, the two Legendary Hammers in his hands ready to mercilessly beat down his enemies, especially that Shen Bu… she had almost killed him!\\n\\n However, a blur before his eyes, and a soft body embraced him. “Little Fatty, Little Fatty… are you okay?”\\n\\n That figure had just moved too quickly, and Zhou Weiqing could not react even if he wanted to. Of course, when he heard the voice, he naturally did not have any thoughts of resisting.\\n\\n As he looked up, he saw Shangguan Fei’er’s face. Worried, anxious, heartache. He too was stunned as he saw that. As their eyes met, both their hearts trembled suddenly.\\n\\n “Stop! Everyone, stop!” Shen Ji’s angry cry rang out. Although his Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills had been restricted by Zhou Weiqing’s Dragon Silencing Seal, his Heavenly Energy was still usable, and that shout of his was not soft at all. Originally, the few who had been surrounding Shangguan Fei’er were just about to continue attacking, but they stopped instantly after his shout.\\n\\n “Don’t touch me!” Zhou Weiqing’s scream rang out at the same time as Shen Ji’s howl. The reason was simple, Shangguan Fei’er was worried that something had happened to him, and lifted her hand to touch his face. Alas, she had forgotten that she was still wearing her Consolidated Claws… if she really strokd his face, Zhou Weiqing’s ‘suave face’ would be totally destroyed.\\n\\n Only then did Shangguan Fei’er realise what was happening and quickly put down her hand, holding onto Zhou Weiqing’s wrist before turning towards Shen Ji. Since Zhou Weiqing was alright, her heart settled down and she released her Infinite Saint Flame.\\n\\n The purple symbol of the Dragon Silencing Seal was still above Shen Ji’s head as he took a quickly stepped forward. By now, the Jingang Wall had disappeared, and he walked to about five yards from Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er before stopping, his eyes filled with curiosity as he looked at Shangguan Fei’er, saying: “You...You…” [1. He is using the honorific ‘you’ 您 instead of 你 here]\\n\\n Shangguan Fei’er took a deep breath, calming herself down as she released her four Consolidated Equipment. With a cold humph, her mouth moved slightly as she said something hidden to him. With a flick of her wrist, she waved it in front of him for a moment, clearly showing him something.\\n\\n Instantly, Shen Ji’s face changed, looking at Shangguan Fei’er respectfully as he bowed in agreement.\\n\\n Shen Bu and the others were at a loss, not knowing what had happened, and they gathered behind Shen Ji, exchanging looks.\\n\\n “Alright, enough, you all can go now.” Shangguan Fei’er waved her hands, like chasing a fly away, motioning for them to leave.\\n\\n Shen Ji said respectfully: “In that case, you take care. We will take our leave now. Let’s go.” As soon as he said that, he turned to leave. Although Shen Bu was not happy about that, she would definitely listen to her senior elder brother. Filled with uncertainty, she could only follow Shen Ji and leave.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing looked at Shangguan Fei’er and asked in a low tone: “You told them your identity?”\\n\\n Shangguan Fei’er nodded slightly and turned to him, saying: “I only told them that I am from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and that we are on a secret mission, and that they are not to harrass your Ruffian Battalion from now. After seeing my identity plaque and Infinite Saint Flames, naturally he would not have any suspicion.”\\n\\n “That’s good too. I believe he will not go to try and verify it with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. After all, you from the Great Saint Lands are not supposed to to join in ordinary fights. Coming here should definitely be a secret mission.” Zhou Weiqing said in a sudden realisation.\\n\\n “Zhou Little Fatty, don’t you know that you almost scared me to death just now.” Shangguan Fei’er said with gritted teeth.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing started momentarily, looking at Shangguan Fei’er still with tears sparkling. Before he could say anything to reassure her, she suddenly grabbed hold of his arm, with a flip threw him him onto the ground before turning to run away, dashing into her tent.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing was totally stunned and confused by that throw, lying there, he thought back to her eyes just now and his heart trembled. Could it be she has fallen for this suave young me? She is truly the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, even her method of expressing love is so different.\\n\\n Face after face appeared above Zhou Weiqing, blocking the sky.\\n\\n “Battalion Commander, are you alright?” Wei Feng asked.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: “Hurry up and pull me up.”\\n\\n Wei Feng said with a serious look, shaking his head: “Boss, we have realised one problem. Offending you is not a problem, but offending our drillmaster is a big problem. You better get up by yourself.”\\n\\n A series of explosive laughter rang out, including Wei Feng’s, and the bunch of inglorious ruffians scattered away.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing jumped up, scolding laughingly: “All of you have no conscience, only violence can make you cooperate huh!”\\n\\n After this, the threat from the Sixteenth Regiment was totally relieved. Although the Peerless Battalion soldiers did not know how Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er had pulled that off, they had seen the two of them fight against nine Six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters and higher, including Shen Ji, a Legion Commander! Such strength, it was enough to leave anyone speechless, especially with their God Tier Consolidated Equipment, that truly left a deep impression on all the ruffian soldiers. One thing was clear, that these ruffians would never dream of using violence against Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er… who would try to ask for trouble like that right?\\n\\n After dinner, Zhou Weiqing sneaked to Shangguan Fei’er’s tent, saying: “Fei’er, Fei’er…”\\n\\n “What?” Shangguan Fei’er’s voice came from the tent, clearly stiff and rigid.\\n\\n She was currently sitting down in her own tent quietly. Today, after dealing with Shen Ji and the others, although she had beaten Zhou Weiqing up, her heart was still in disorder.\\n\\n No, that’s not possible. How can I like that little scoundrel. He is my little sister’s man!\\n\\n That line had been repeated in her heart more than a hundred times, as the struggle in her heart caused this Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace to be at her wit’s end for once. She did not know how she was going to face Zhou Weiqing outside, and for the entire day she had not even left her tent, not even to eat.\\n\\n “Fei’er, let’s go out to play!”\\n\\n “Not going.” Shangguan Fei’er did not even think about it and rejected him directly.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said helplessly: “That’s not your style right… not even to play? I’ll bring you to the TianBei City, okay?”\\n\\n “Not going.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing furrowed his brow, thinking to himself that this was not a good sign indeed! If she bottled everything up for too long, what happened if she blew up some other time or place, that would be a problem.\\n\\n “Feier, you have to at least tell me what happened. Did I offend you?” Zhou Weiqing asked hesitatingly.\\n\\n This time, Shangguan Fei’er did not make any sound.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing lowered his voice and said: “Did you really fall for me? Looks like my suave charm is just too great!”\\n\\n “Get lost!” Shangguan Fei’er’s obviously muffled shout rang out.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing thought to himself that he had to use some stronger medicine to deal with this, and he said: “Fei’er, this is not like you at all. Liking someone is liking someone, what is there to be afraid of? Your character is definitely a frank, straightforward one, one who dares to face her emotions head-on. In truth… actually… well... besides Bing’er, I also love Tian’er, and we have also promised to marry each other as well.”\\n\\n “What did you say?!” A flash, and Shangguan Fei’er charged out, grabbing hold of Zhou Weiqing’s shirt angrily as she exclaimed: “You dare to let down my sister?!”\\n\\n Seeing Shangguan Fei’er’s red eyes, Zhou Weiqing started. This fiery and vivacious young lady, although she did not have the gentle nature of Shangguan Bing’er, had her own attraction. In terms of emotions, Zhou Weiqing was like many other men, with a very weak resistance against beautiful women, let alone a top beauty like Shangguan Fei’er who looked exactly like his love Shangguan Bing’er.\\n\\n However, before today, Zhou Weiqing only had an appreciation for her beauty, not any untoward feelings.\\n\\n Yet, after that fight today, and how she had jumped at all costs to save him when he had been in danger… and now seeing her teary red eyes, it all tugged on his heartstrings.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-16-chapter-130-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
