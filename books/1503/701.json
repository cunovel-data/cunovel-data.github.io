He was skinny, with sunken eyes and almost greenish eye bags. His looks were actually decent, but any discerning person would be able to tell that this was a youth who had overindulged in debauchery. Previously, Zhou Weiqing had not even noticed him, and he could not imagine that such a person could actually attend the XuanTian Trials. \n “What is there to know or not, this Young Master here will definitely be selected. You both aren’t locals right, otherwise you will definitely know who this Young Master is.” \n Even as he was speaking, his perverted eyes were fixed upon Shangguan Bing’er, roving up and down her body. Alas, he did not know that this was already rubbing against Zhou Weiqing’s \u0027reverse scale\u0027. \n Zhou Weiqing maintained his curious look as he said: “Isn’t the XuanTian Trials all about selecting talents for the XuanTian Palace? Everything depends on power, what has that got to do with status?” \n The youth gave a disdainful humph, ignoring Zhou Wieqing totally. Instead, he grinned at Shangguan Bing’er and said: “Heh, this beauty here, you are looking good! After the trials are over, how about I treat you to a meal? This year’s selection quota have already been fixed, and you do not have any chance. However, you are still young, as long as I help you prepare in advance, you might have a chance next year. My father is the Governor of this City, and my name is Sang De. Let us get to know each other more.” As he said that, he actually reached out his hand in an attempt to hold Shangguan Bing’er’s hand. \n He was successful in holding a hand. Alas, it was not Shangguan Bing’er’s small hand, but a large and powerful hand. Zhou Weiqing’s smiling face appeared right in front of him, shaking his hand vigorously as he said happily: “Oh, it is actually the Young Master of the Governor, forgive me for my ignorance.” \n “Bastard! Let go of my hand!” Sang De tried his best to pull his hand out, but realised that Zhou Weiqing’s large hand was like a steel vice. No matter how much he circulated his Heavenly Energy, it was as if a clay oxen going into the sea, never to return. He found no matter what he did, he was unable to pull his hand out. Instead, Zhou Weiqing’s hand continued tightening his grip, and soon an acute pain began to travel from his hand. \n Right at that moment, a stern voice rang out. “What are you all doing, it is your turn to ascend the stage and take the test.” \n In the time that they spoken, several groups of five had already completed their tests, and it was their turn. \n Only then did Zhou Weiqing release Sang De’s hand. After all, this was their territory. More importantly, they needed to pass the XuanTian Trials to enter the XuanTian Sect. As such, he held himself back from exacting revenge. Of course, with Zhou Weiqing’s character, he would definitely not let this Sang De go so easily. \n Besides the three of them, there were still two others in front of them who would join them in the group of five. As they ascended the stage, each of them stood in front of a stone pillar. \n That Master Er Chun stood there all along, his face impassive and expressionless, his hands behind his back as he did not even watch the participants closely. It was as if all of this had nothing to do with him. \n As the personnel gave the sign to begin, the five of them began infusing their Heavenly Energy into the transparent crystal before them. \n Zhou Weiqing did not rush to circulate his own Heavenly Energy, instead turning his head to look at Sang De. To his surprise, this Sang De’s Heavenly Energy level was not low, even with his body that was hollowed out by debauchery, he was still actually at the five-Jeweled stage. White light rose steadily in front of him. \n Zhou Weiqing smirked to himself inwardly, knowing that for such a fellow, it was highly likely his Heavenly Energy was not fully cultivated by himself. Although the white light rose rather rapidly, it was clearly mixed and impure, a little weak and unstable even. That could only prove that his Heavenly Energy was most likely either raised with the help a lot of medicines, or with some experts using unique means to raise his cultivation level externally. Such a method was undoubtedly able to raise his cultivation level quickly, but it was detrimental to him in the long term. Everything else aside, it was probable that he would not even be able to pass the threshold between the Zun Stage and Zong Stage in the future. \n Zhou Weiqing turned his head again, giving an imperceptible nod to Shangguan Bing’er on the other side. At the same time, he began to transform his Saint Energy into Heavenly Energy, slowly infusing it into the crystal, causing the white light from his crystal to begin catching up with Sang De. However, he did not overdo it, only releasing sufficient Heavenly Energy to maintain his position to be slightly higher than Sang De as they both raised up. \n Right at that moment, Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes flashed brightly, as a powerful Heavenly Energy reverberation burst forth from her body. A mass of shocked cries rose from the audience as they witnessed the ray of white light burst forth from the crystal in front of her at a shocking speed, the thick white light instantly surpassing the other four all the way to an unprecedented five metre height. With a sudden loud Peng, the crystal in front of her actually shattered, unable to withstand the massive Heavenly Energy. \n Previously Er Chun was still impassive and unmoved, but he was given a fright by the sight before him. Staring at the shattered crystal, he couldn’t help but exclaim: “S-seven Jewels!?” \n Currently, his expression no longer held that arrogance, as he looked at Shangguan Bing’er with a shocked gaze. \n This young lady looked to be no older than twenty years or so, yet she already had reached a height of seven Jewels? How was that possible? Even for those young talents cultivated from young in the XuanTian Palace, they might not even have such a power right? \n How could he know that Shangguan Bing’er’s cultivation level was also considered the cream of the crop even amongst the younger generation of the entire Boundless Mainland. Although the XuanTian Continent was powerful, with the existence of a Great Saint Land like the XuanTian Palace, when it was compared to the Boundless Mainland, there was still some difference. \n Shangguan Bing’er withdrew her tender small hands, smiling gently as if she had done something insignificant. \n At this point, the radiance she emitted totally eclipsed all the other participants. A seven-Jeweled cultivation stage, in the history of the XuanTian Trials, it was not that this had never happened before, but it was definitely extremely rare. Even when it did, it was usually only at the final stages which was held in the Heavenly City, not a preliminary trial of a outskirts city. More importantly, those were usually powerhouses who were extremely close to the age of thirty. Not only was Shangguan Bing’er extremely beautiful, she looked like an ordinary young lady of twenty who was defenseless. With such a stark contrast to her powerful cultivation level, how could it not increase the shock value? \n Taking a deep breath, Er Chun nodded to Shangguan Bing’er, saying: “May I ask, young lady, what is your name?” \n Shangguan Bing’er smiled as she replied: “My name is Shangguan Bing’er.” \n Hearing her name, Er Chun discovered he had no impression of such a name, and he could only nod without saying anything else. However, deep in his heart, he was feeling rather awkward. \n Just like what Sang De had bragged about earlier, the current Trials that were being held were no more than a sham, a mere formality. In truth, Er Chun had already fixed the three selected participants under the table. Of course, that was because those three had already given more than sufficient bribes to him, and only those who had given the most would be given the positions. These people were not fools, as long as they could enter the XuanTian Palace, even if it was just an outer disciple, not only would they profit from it, just with the increase in status alone, would they be afraid of recouping those bribes?\n Zhou Weiqing had his own plans in having Shangguan Bing’er reveal her true strength. After all, she was unable to control the appearance her own cultivation like he could, and instead of trying to hide things and invoke suspicion, they might as well show her cultivation. In this way, with the talents that Shangguan Bing’er had shown, they would be able to quickly enter the inner core of the XuanTian Palace. This would be a great benefit to them gaining the Spatial Teleportation Gem.\n This was just the first step in Zhou Weiqing’s plan. Whenever he acted, he usually only did so after proper planning, and all the future steps had already been arranged. \n Very quickly, all of the participants had completed their Heavenly Energy examination. \n Er Chun swept his gaze over the participants before he said impassively: “The top ten of the Heavenly Energy will go on to the second round. Announce their names.” \n As soon as he spoke, the participants burst into an uproar. \n It had to be known that most of the participants had nearly the same cultivation level, and it was definitely unfair to just determine their suitability from Heavenly Energy cultivation alone. Furthermore, this was not the original rules of the trial!\n “Master Er Chun, that isn’t proper right? Heavenly Energy is just one facet of the power of Heavenly Jewel Masters, and it can’t represent everything! Furthermore, according to the rules of the XuanTian Trials, the Heavenly Energy Examination should only to see if we have the qualification, not an actual elimination round.” One of the participants piped out. \n Er Chun glared angrily at him. “Do you think this Elder needs you all to teach me how to do things? Each area has its own method of doing things, its own rules. In the W\u0027Batu City, my rules are the rules of the W\u0027Batu City. Remove his name.” \n Instantly, the crowd was silenced. Although their feelings were still tempestuous, no one else dared to speak out.\n “Do you see now, it is useless. No matter how strong you are, you will not be able to gain the selection spot.” Sang De stood by Zhou Weiqing’s side as he spoke mockingly. However, this time, he dared not use the same gaze to look at Shangguan Bing’er. The power she had displayed was far too terrifying for him. Although his father was the governor, he would not dare offend a Heavenly Jewel Master who had already entered the Zong Stage, especially one so young. \n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, nodding to Sang De as he said: “Let us wait and see then.” \n Soon after was the proclamation of the ten names who would be able to enter the next round of selection trials. Naturally, Shangguan Bing’er would be in the list. As for Zhou Weiqing, he had maintained the appearance of his Heavenly Energy to be slightly higher than Sang De, and was still amongst the top few of the remaining ten. Besides that, Sang De had proven his words to be accurate, smoothly entering the top ten without any problems. \n As the ten stepped onto the stage to form a single row in front of Er Chun, the youngest there were clearly Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er. If anything, Zhou Weiqing’s looks were actually more mature than his actual age. \n Er Chun said passively: “If anyone thinks that my rules are not fair, you can choose to withdraw. If your Heavenly Energy isn’t even able to reach the top ten, what right do you have to complain? Indeed, Heavenly Energy is just one facet when evaluating a Heavenly Jewel Master, but it is also the root of all Heavenly Jewel Masters. Without a strong Heavenly Energy at your core, even if you have some powerful Stored Skills, can you unleash it properly? There are only three positions, naturally I will be choosing them from those who have a good cultivation level and strong talents. Next, this Elder will be personally testing each of you ten.”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-25-chapter-237-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
