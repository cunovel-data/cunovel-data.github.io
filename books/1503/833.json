{"id":52007,"no":833,"title":"Chapter 283 - The Evolved Ancient Tree of Life (3)","content":"The evolution of the ancient tree of life had an extraordinary significance to the sidhe; it could even cause the Sidhe Queen’s power to increase by leaps and bounds. At this moment, these elders had absolutely no way of determining how powerful she was right now. \n “Rise, my people.” The Sidhe Queen’s gentle voice resonated through the air, allowing every single sidhe to hear her clearly. Her gentle and captivating voice elicited a sense of allegiance in their hearts.\n None of the sidhe dared to go against her command, all of them got up in a uniform manner.\n The Sidhe Queen looked at her people with gentle eyes, like how a mother would look at her children. The golden light on her body had become more intense, causing Zhou Weiqing to also glow in a layer of rich golden light. \n “My people, I believe all of you have witnessed the miracle. Indeed, our ancient tree of life has finally evolved after thousands of years. To our tribe, it could be described as a miracle.” \n The Sidhe Queen’s simple sentence stirred up the crowd in an instant, triggering loud cheers to erupt on the spot. Every single one of them looked at the Sidhe Queen with zeal in their eyes. Even Zhou Weiqing was able to clearly sense the firm belief that the Sidhe had in their Queen.\n The Sidhe Queen was all smiles as she looked at her people who were filled with excitement. After a long pause, she slowly lifted her left hand and gestured for them to stop. Even though there was a large population of sidhe present, they all quietened down immediately upon her gesture.\n “I think that everyone must be very curious about what happened during the period of time I was gone, as well as the reason behind the ancient tree of life’s evolution. I will now tell you everything. Before I go into detail, let me introduce a man to you first. He is none other than Zhou Weiqing, the person standing next to me, mankind’s greatest Heavenly Jewel Master of the future.”\n As she spoke, the Sidhe Queen had already shifted her gaze to Zhou Weiqing. The zeal in the sidhe’s eyes was immediately replaced with shock. At the same time, their gazes were fixated on him. \n Zhou Weiqing gave a slight nod, as a way of greeting members of the Sidhe. He shared a telepathic connection with the Sidhe Queen, hence naturally, he knew what she was going to do next. As he secretly felt deeply moved, at the same time, he continued coordinating with her. \n The Sidhe Queen continued, “Everyone must be wondering why I am holding onto a man’s hand. It was because of him that our ancient tree of life evolved; it was also him who saved my daughter. He is the great benefactor of our tribe, and he will forever be the sidhe’s most esteemed ally!”\n Hearing the Sidhe Queen’s words, immediately, the look on all their faces changed, as well as their gazes that were upon Zhou Weiqing. \n A human being actually helped the ancient tree of life evolve? Initially, the sidhe were filled with disbelief. Seconds later, their rationality told them that the Sidhe Queen would not say such things wildly. \n The Sidhe Queen continued, “I know it’s very hard for everyone to believe what I just said, but let me assure you that it is the truth. The other day, Zhou Weiqing and I managed to catch up with the enemy who abducted my daughter, and defeated him. When the enemy used the Princess as a hostage, he did everything he could to protect your little Princess at all costs, even if it resulted in him being misunderstood by me. And because I misunderstood him, I had severely injured him. After killing the enemy, he was already on the verge of death.”\n Having heard what the Sidhe Queen said, the twelve elders looked ashamed. The sidhe were normally kind-hearted by nature, but over the past few days, they had kept Zhou Weiqing’s wives in captivity, while Zhou Weiqing, on the other hand, had paid such a huge price to rescue their Princess. \n The Sidhe Queen added, “Our race will never return a kind act with enmity. I couldn’t possibly watch the man who saved my daughter lose his life. At that time, Zhou Weiqing’s injuries were severe. As there were no other alternative, I had no choice but to use the Sidhe Heart.”\n The moment she said that, it caused a commotion amongst the sidhe, as they knew what the Sidhe Heart meant to the sidhe. At once, chaos ensued. \n “Be quiet! Let Her Majesty finish her words,” shouted the First Elder. A strong suppressive aura was released from him thereafter. He could infer from the evolution of the ancient tree of life, as well as the Life Saint Energy that was released from the Sidhe Queen, that things were not that simple. \n The First Elder occupied a very high status within the sidhe, and hence he was able to quell the ongoing commotion, causing everyone to quieten down.\n The Sidhe Queen seemed to have expected such a situation to happen. She looked extremely calm and collected. After the commotion had died down, she calmly continued, “You must be thinking that I had given him too much, right? However, let me tell you - compared to what Zhou Weiqing had sacrificed for us, what I did was only a drop in the ocean. The ancient tree of life behind me is the living proof.”\n “After I had saved Zhou Weiqing, he discovered that I was in an extremely weak state. Hence, he used his Saint Energy to administer treatment on me. Saint Energy is the most powerful Attribute in the entire world; it possesses the power of creation, as well as Creation Energy. I can safely tell everyone that I have officially become an Empress - I can use the Sidhe Heart more than once. All the functions of the Sidhe Heart had been completely embedded in my body. All of this was because of Zhou Weiqing. \n As she spoke, the golden light around the Sidhe Queen, no, the Sidhe Empress’ six transparent wings became brighter, allowing every single one of her people to see them more clearly.\n The six wings signified her evolution into the Sidhe Empress. In the history of the Sidhe, it had been several thousand years since the emergence of a Sidhe Empress. Not only was the Sidhe Empress required to be a Max Level Heavenly God, she also needed the support of an evolved ancient tree of life.\n The Sidhe Empress gave off an invisible majestic force - the suppressive aura was so strong that all the sidhe fell to their knees once again. \n “From now on, Zhou Weiqing’s commands are my commands. As our ally, from today onwards, he has access to all our resources and is free to use them. Defying this order will be regarded as treason!”\n “Yes, Your Majesty.”\n The sidhe were not the only ones shocked - Zhou Weiqing’s wives were equally shocked by the news as well. \n Although they were aware of the fact that Zhou Weiqing had already established relations with the sidhe the moment they saw him holding hands with the Sidhe Empress, they never imagined that the Sidhe Empress would treat him that well to such an extent. Right now, Zhou Weiqing’s status in the sidhe was equivalent to a King. They were completely stunned when the Sidhe Empress said that he was free to use all of their resources. Naturally, they assumed that Zhou Weiqing had an affair with the Sidhe Empress - they would never believe that there was nothing going on between the two of them. \n However, as Zhou Weiqing’s women, even if they were jealous or unhappy, they were absolutely not allowed to voice their displeasure at this moment. At most, they could only throw daggers at him with their eyes. \n Only at this moment, the Sidhe Empress had finally released Zhou Weiqing’s hand. She held out one hand before saying, “Weiqing, please visit the ancient tree of life with your wives. I believe there are still some matters we ought to discuss about.”\n Zhou Weiqing nodded, “Alright.”\n Following the Sidhe Empress’ lead, Zhou Weiqing and his wives directly entered the canopy of the ancient tree of life. As for the other members of the Sidhe, they had not recovered from their shock. Of course, it would not take long before they came around. The Sidhe Queen had already evolved to a Sidhe Empress - regardless of any decisions she made, not a single sidhe would dare to disobey her orders. \n A day later.\n “Little Fatty Zhou, this is so unlike you! Is there really nothing between you and the Sidhe Empress?” As they were flying in mid-air, Shangguan Fei’er looked at Zhou Weiqing, who was filled with helplessness, in disbelief.\n After spending a full day at the secret meeting with the Sidhe Empress, they were finally on their way home. When the meeting had just begun, due to the fact that the Sidhe Empress could sense Zhou Weiqing’s awkwardness, she immediately explained everything to the five women, stating that Zhou Weiqing and her would be nothing more than a friend and an ally. She even made an agreement with them that if Zhou Weiqing were to have a son in future, she would be willing to marry her Sidhe Princess off to him. \n Perhaps because the Sidhe Princess had absorbed too much pure Saint Energy, she was still in a deep slumber. As she was shrouded by the ancient tree of life’s massive Life Energy, she was slowly absorbing the Saint Energy. It was believed that she would experience a faster growth. However, to human beings, the very long lifespan of the sidhe was sufficient for her to wait for Zhou Weiqing’s future son to grow into adulthood. \n “I really did not have an affair! I am an honest person. Didn’t Her Majesty already explain everything?” Zhou Weiqing looked pitifully at the five women.\n However, even the gentle Shangguan Bing’er shot him a disdainful glance.\n Shangguan Fei’er scoffed, “Only heaven knows whether or not she was covering up your lies. If nothing happened between the both of you, why did she agree that easily to move the whole sidhe to the Heavenly Bow Empire, and even……” \n Zhou Weiqing didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, “I am being falsely accused! Darling Fei’er, I am truly not having an affair this time. You have been interrogating me since we left the sealed grounds. Please let me off. I am already very contented to have the five of you by my side. I don’t want to bring any unnecessary trouble upon myself.”\n Little Witch needed Zhou Weiqing to carry her during the flight, hence she continuously stayed by his side. She laughed, “Is that really so? She’s THE Sidhe Queen. With a partner like her, even I myself feel good just thinking about it. Are you sure you can let go of this opportunity?”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-283-3","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
