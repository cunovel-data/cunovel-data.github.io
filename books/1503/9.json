(1) Zhou Weiqing had only seen Shangguan Bing’er once, and that was during her award ceremony. The countries in Boundless Mainland had very similar titles for nobles, the six titles in order of nobility from low to high – Lord, Baron, Viscount, Count, Marquis, Duke. Of course, for different countries, the various noble titles might have varying amount of power. Shangguan Bing’er was born from a common family, but she had been awarded a title of Lord at the age of twelve, Baron the next year. This year she was 15 years old, older than Zhou Weiqing by 2 years, but her noble title was already the same as him at Viscount. However, in comparison, her title was truly earned by herself unlike Zhou Weiqing’s titles, which were only because of his father. Even though Princess Difuya was a rising star in the royal family, she paled in comparison to Shangguan Bing’er. Although Shangguan Bing’er was a year younger than the princess, she already possessed 2 sets of Power Jewels, furthermore she had both Elemental and Power Jewels. At the age of 12, Shangguan Bing’er already managed to cultivate to level 3 Heavenly Energy and Awakened her Twin Power Jewels, which were known as Heavenly Jewels. Such a phenomenon was much rarer than giving birth to twins in families. Especially in such a small country like Heavenly Bow Empire where the number of Heavenly Jewel Masters they have are honestly really pathetic. The reason why Shangguan Bing’er is held in such regard by the Empire, given the rank of viscount as such a young age, is because she is actually the second Heavenly Jewel Master in the whole empire! And the first Heavenly Jewel Master is actually Zhou Weiqing’s father, Admiral Zhou. Although Zhou Weiqing’s father was a Heavenly Jewel Master, but the class was still a mystery in Zhou Weiqing’s heart. As he had blocked meridians since young, Admiral Zhou looked down upon him and thus never discussed anything regarding Heavenly Jewel Masters. The only thing that Zhou Weiqing knew was that on the surface, Heaven Jewel Masters seemed to be the combination of a Physical and Elemental Jewel Master. However, while there were definitely many similarities, there was actually also a lot of differences in terms of cultivation, promotion of Heavenly Jewel Masters. In fact, even the look and abilities of their jewels also differed in some ways as compared to the individual Elemental or Physical Jewel Masters. However, he had no idea what the differences actually were; all he knew was that Heavenly Jewel Masters were known as having much greater strength in comparison. Many a time had he daydreamed that he was a Heavenly Jewel Master. The one and only time that Zhou Weiqing had seen Shangguan Bing’er previously was the day that she had been awarded with the title of Viscount. The one who had awarded her the title was the Emperor himself, and at that time Admiral Zhou had brought him along to view the procession. As such, even though he had seen Shangguan Bing’er before and could recognize this top beauty of the empire at a single glance, she did not recognize him. Unfortunately, right at this very moment, the facial expression on this top beauty was extremely ugly, her perfect features were ice cold, brow furrowed in anger and her hands were clasped protectively in front of her chest. At this time, Shangguan Bing’er was rather despondent. She had just been walking out of the headquarters when the youth in front of her had suddenly recklessly grabbed the curtains, and had even grabbed her sensitive areas! In fact, from a young age, no male had ever touched any part of her body, she had no idea who her father was, and had been brought up singlehandedly by her mother. In fact, if she had not been protecting herself reflexively from the grasp just now, the kick on Zhou Weiqing would have been a lot harsher. Zhou Weiqing also awoke to reality at this point, and recalling and associating the words of the archer earlier, he realised that this top beauty in front of him was clearly his superior officer, the battalion officer of the 3rd battalion, the very officer who was supposed to issue him his gear. Also, looking at Shangguan Bing’er’s face and actions, it was clear to him where he had grabbed earlier. In the Star Forest earlier, he had only seen the naked back of Princess Difuya and had been exceedingly excited. Now, he had actually touched Shangguan Bing’er! Could this be his lucky day[1. Lol, of course he forgot it almost got him killed earlier]? In this one single day, he had had ‘ambiguous relations’ with the 2 of the most famous young ladies in the whole empire! Thinking about where he had grabbed earlier… *Pooh* Once again, twin rows of blood spurted out of his nose. Although his face was arranged in an honest expression, that nosebleed betrayed the dirty thoughts he was currently having. “Who are you?” Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s nosebleed, Shangguan Bing’er’s expression got even angrier, and she drew her sword and shouted in rage while pointing it at him. “Ah! It is a misunderstanding, I’m a new recruit. I\u0027m here to report and get my new equipment.” Zhou Weiqing quickly waved his form in front of her. Shangguan Bing’er took a swift step forward towards Zhou Weiqing, grabbing the form from him to take a look. Her face softened a little, as she knew that it truly had been a coincidence previously, though she was still very angry at Zhou Weiqing. “Why are you bumbling around clumsily for?” With a *qiang* sound, Shangguan Bing’er sheathed her sword, the killing intent in her eyes had disappeared but her tone was still cold and angry. After all, what girl would be able to keep her temper after being grabbed that way. Zhou Weiqing had been observing her expressions, and was very impressed in his heart. Look at Shangguan Bing’er! She was born from a common family, and clearly her moral character was way better than the princess. The grievance she had suffered was no smaller than Princess Difuya\u0027s, but the reaction was just so different. If only she was my fiance instead, how great that would be? “Follow me inside.” Shangguan Bing’er pushed aside the curtain and re-entered the headquarters. Zhou Weiqing was about to enter, when someone sidled up next to him. Only then did he realise that a male soldier had actually been following Shangguan Bing’er out of the headquarters previously. He was wearing light armor covering the vital spots of the body, and with a helmet with a yellow feather, this was the mark of a Company Leader. Previously, all of Zhou Weiqing’s attention had been focused on the alluring Shangguan Bing’er and he had not noticed his presence. A voice sounded out in his ear, as soft as a mosquito’s buzzing, “Hey Boy, how was the feeling like?” Zhou Weiqing was at this point gloating inwardly, and he subconsciously praised out loud: “The battalion commander’s chest muscles are not bad!” The Company Leader had only been teasing him, with a bit of envy mixed in, little did he expect that this young rascal would actually reply him out loud; this seemed rather at odds with his honest outlook. Regarding Zhou Weiqing’s reply, he could only think of one phrase: How intrepid! A cold light flashed, and Zhou Weiqing felt the ends of his hair stand up suddenly as the curtain in front of him was suddenly cut into two. In front of him, at the doorway, with her sword quivering in her hands, Shangguan Bing’er stood glaring coldly at Zhou Weiqing: “If you talk some more rubbish, I’ll make sure you become an eunuch.” “Eh, Battalion Commander, I’m so sorry I was wrong.” Zhou Weiqing had regretted his words earlier the moment they had left his mouth, after all he had been so loud and Shangguan Bing’er was so close. He hurriedly admitted his mistake with a apologetic smiling face. Shangguan Bing’er gave an angry hmph, before turning back to head into the headquarters. The Company Leader seeing the situation, gave Zhou Weiqing a big thumbs up before he ran off quickly. Although Shangguan Bing’er did not put on any airs and had a very good temperament, as soon as combat started she was definitely more valiant than anyone else. He did not want to end up becoming an excuse for her to vent her anger.
