Frankly speaking, it is impossible for me to say that it never crossed my mind at all. I am a man, after all. However, the moment I thought of my wives, I did my best to restrain my thoughts. Besides, the Sidhe Empress is the supreme leader of the sidhe, as well as the purest being. There was no way she would allow me to do anything to her! I swear to the heavens that if I did anything to the Sidhe Empress, all of you will stop loving me. I’m sure this oath is sufficiently cruel, right?” After hearing what he said, even Shangguan Fei’er, who had continuously interrogated him, stopped pursuing the matter at once. She laughed and said, “Fine. Since you behaved yourself, I will reward you when we’re back.” Tian’er casually added, “Yeah, I can attest to the fact that nothing happened between the Sidhe Empress and him. Even though the Sidhe Empress had also received Weiqing’s Saint Energy, it was different from the one that we received when we were physically intimate with him. It was merely superficial. There wasn’t any scent left behind by Weiqing on the Sidhe Empress’ body. Due to the fact that I had cultivated the Saint Energy with Weiqing, I was able to sense it.” Zhou Weiqing stared speechlessly at Tian’er, “Darling, why didn’t you tell them earlier?” Tian’er blinked her eyes and said, “They didn’t ask me! Furthermore, since you are such a womanizer, you ought to be taught a lesson from time to time.” “You……” Zhou Weiqing was slightly exasperated. Tian’er burst out laughing, “You want to beat me up, huh? Come at me then!” She stuck her chest out at him as she spoke. “Alright, alright. I give up.” Zhou Weiqing looked indignantly at the five women who were giggling amongst themselves. “My life is going to get harder from now on. It’s alright, all of you can gang up against me. Be careful, one day I might just run away.” “Don’t you dare,” said the five women in unison. Due to his elevated cultivation base, their journey back to the Heavenly Bow Empire was much faster than their journey to the sealed grounds. In just a few days’ time, they had returned to the Heavenly Bow Empire. Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue were still in secluded meditation with the help of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy, and Ming Yu had already returned to the frontlines a while back. The Bai Da Empire had been very peaceful as of late. Even then, every single person would rather err on the side of caution than be careless. After all, even if the Heavenly Bow Empire had annexed the Kalise Empire, it still could not be compared to a typically powerful empire such as the Bai Da Empire. The first thing that Zhou Weiqing did was to pay a visit to his godfather and his father. After he had made sure that everything was fine within the Heavenly Bow Empire, he proceeded to visit Duan Tianlang’s place of residence. Since he had brought the most important ingredient, the Sidhe Empress’ blood, back with him, without a doubt, his next step was to create the Consolidating Equipment Scroll of the eleventh piece of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set with Duan Tianlang. Zhou Weiqing was not sure about how long it would take, but he could well imagine how difficult it would be. “Senior Uncle, I am back.” Zhou Weiqing knocked on the door. “Did you bring it back?” Zhou Weiqing heard Duan Tianlang’s eager voice first, before seeing him. The door opened and Duan Tianlang’s unshaven face emerged from behind it. Upon seeing Zhou Weiqing, he pulled him into the room immediately. Zhou Weiqing chuckled, “Of course I brought it back. With me handling the task personally, how could it possibly fail? The Sidhe even promised me that I am free to use their resources whenever I want to.” Duan Tianlang scoffed at him, “Sure, keep on bragging. Quick, pass me the item!” Duan Tianlang got himself all excited the moment he heard Zhou Weiqing mention that he brought the Sidhe Empress’ blood back with him. Zhou Weiqing passed the bottle of the Sidhe Empress’ blood to Duan Tianlang and asked, “Senior Uncle, how’s the design coming along? As well as the other materials.” Duan Tianlang chuckled, “Everything is ready, except for the precious thing that you brought back.” Looking at the small green bottle that Zhou Weiqing had passed to him, Duan Tianlang turned around and walked to his workstation before pointing at the table. Zhou Weiqing walked over and indeed, the design on the table was different from before. Even though the original design was almost perfect, some of the details were still unrefined. The current design on his table was a lot more elaborate in comparison. The design was so complicated that it would cause an ordinary person to feel dizzy with blurred vision upon seeing it. It was almost impossible to distinguish the lines, but on the other hand, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes were beaming as he was looking at it. Duan Tianlang held onto the small bottle containing the Sidhe Empress’ blood tightly. His face became solemn, “Weiqing, everything is ready right now. All that’s left is the final step. I have confidence in my experience, but I am lacking in terms of cultivation. One has to at least be of the Heavenly Emperor Stage in order to create the final Consolidating Equipment Scroll of an eleven-piece Legendary Set. Hence, I can only guide you from the side. You need to complete this final step on your own. This is going to be a very long process, and there must be no pauses in between. You must prepare yourself for this.” Zhou Weiqing looked at Duan Tianlang and nodded resolutely, “Senior Uncle, don’t you worry - I have the ability to control Time Reversal and will be able to correct my mistakes in time, if needed. Additionally, my cultivation base has been elevated once again after the trip to the Sidhe. I am this close to becoming a Max Level Heavenly Emperor now. I am confident that I will succeed, and will definitely not disappoint you. However, you have to promise me that upon the completion of the final piece of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set, you will definitely take good care of your health. Give me a chance to be filial to you, ok? Duan Tianlang smiled, “Silly boy, did you think that I want to die that badly? Moreover, apart from creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, I now have another wish.” “Oh? What is it?” Zhou Weiqing looked at him in surprise. In his eyes, Duan Tianlang had no other hobbies apart from creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Duan Tianlang replied, “My other wish is to watch you continuously create miracles.” Bam —— Zhou Weiqing felt warm blood surge through him and a burning sensation in his eyes. Tears started to well up in his eyes, “Senior Uncle……” “Alright, pull yourself together. We are about to start. Leave the process of making the Consolidating Ink to me. You should ease your mind first, and make sure you’re in your best condition.” “Yes.” Zhou Weiqing answered respectfully. He sat cross-legged in front of Duan Tianlang’s workstation and entered the state of cultivation. Duan Tianlang walked over to the other side and carefully took out a palm-sized alms bowl. Its body was entirely transparent, in a shade of emerald green. It was an imperial green glass type of jade, or otherwise known as the purest grade of jade. It did not only represent life aura, it also possessed the highest prestige amongst all gems. Only a material of such quality could support and keep the numerous valuable ingredients under control, in order to carry out the process of making the Consolidating Ink. Duan Tianlang’s eyes were filled with waves of emotions as he gently stroked the alms bowl. The alms bowl had a beautiful name, called ‘Jade Tide’. After getting his hands on this treasure, Duan Tianlang had barely used it. Ever since he became a God Tier Master, he had only used it five times in total. During the last two times, he used it to make the final piece of Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya’s ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ Set, as well as the tenth piece of Zhou Weiqing’s ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set. The Consolidating Ink that he created using Jade Tide during the first five times were of the highest quality, thus helping him complete the process of creating the scrolls. However, in Duan Tianlang’s eyes, even if he added the first five Consolidating Ink that he made together, they wouldn’t be able to compare to the current one. The Consolidating Ink that he was about to create was going to be the most important one in his entire life. Zhou Weiqing had always been very grateful to Duan Tianlang. However, he was unaware that Duan Tianlang was equally grateful for his existence in his life. Duan Tianlang, a God Tier Master, was the only successor of The Legacy of Strength lineage. Despite his close relations with Long Shiya, he would not favor Zhou Weiqing because of it. The only reason why he had worked his heart out for Zhou Weiqing was actually because of his own relationship with Zhou Weiqing. Firstly, Zhou Weiqing was the most likely person to become a God Tier Master within the Legacy of Strength lineage, and the facts had already proven this point. He had officially become a God Tier Master. At the same time, he had even managed to help Duan Tianlang fulfill a few of his most important wishes, which were also his biggest regrets. The appearance of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set itself had reignited Duan Tianlang’s hope and given him a new lease of life. During that moment, he was shocked and deeply moved at the same time. Till now, those feelings had not dwindled a single bit. One could imagine how important it was for Duan Tianlang, as a God Tier Master, to help Zhou Weiqing create the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set, and being able to see it exist at the same time as the ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ Set. Without Zhou Weiqing, Duan Tianlang might have worked himself to death. After all, Zhou Weiqing had given him two more chances at life by channeling Saint Energy into his body, allowing him to finally have the ability to become a higher level God Tier Master, who could personally design and create a Legendary Set that consisted of eleven pieces. After all, Duan Tianlang was only a Heavenly King, and under no circumstances could he advance to the Heavenly Emperor Stage. Furthermore, there had never been any Heavenly King God Tier Master who had designed the eleventh piece of a Legendary Set, in the whole history of Consolidating Equipment Masters. This was an absolute miracle - making it happen, completing its design, about to personally create the Consolidating Equipment Scroll of the Legendary Set, Duan Tianlang could die happy, with not a single regret. As he turned around and looked at Zhou Weiqing who was sitting upright, in the midst of getting himself into his best condition wholeheartedly, Duan Tianlang had a resolute look in his eyes. There was only one chance and they must succeed - there was no room for failure. Carefully holding and lifting Jade Tide in his hands, Duan Tianlang slowly closed his eyes and quickly entered a meditative state. This was also one of the advantages that Saint Energy had provided him - he did not require too much time to enter his best state. Naturally, this was referring to his state of mind, not his cultivation. Suddenly, Duan Tianlang opened his eyes abruptly. Two rays of light beamed from his eyes; he suddenly rubbed both his hands together, pushing his left hand inwards and his right hand outwards. Under the support of the dense silver Spatial Heavenly Energy, Jade Tide started spinning violently in the air. An emerald green halo instantly spread out from within it.
