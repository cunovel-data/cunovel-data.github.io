As the seraph’s body flickered, a huge white-gold long sword had appeared within his hand before it struck the Destruction Sword once again. \\n\\n The Angel Sword was only a hundred meters in length - it paled significantly in comparison to the Destruction Sword. Perhaps it was due to the symbol earlier but in this moment, it managed to block the attack from the huge sword, albeit with much difficulty. \\n\\n A purple light flashed within Fen Tian’s eyes; the eight long legs on the sides of his body throbbed, and eight rays of purplish black light shone upon the Destruction Sword at the same time. Immediately, the layer of whitish golden light that was enveloping the Destruction Sword, as a result of the shattered symbol, had immediately dispersed. Furthermore, the light on the Destruction Sword had abruptly become twice as bright. \\n\\n Pff——\\n\\n The Angel Sword had shattered - even the seraph was sliced into halves in mid-air. Its enormous body did not directly vanish. Instead, it was being absorbed by the Destruction Sword - being completely devoured by the Destruction light at a speed that was distinguishable by the naked eye.\\n\\n It was apparent that Tian’er’s body swayed for a bit; her face had become very pale. Blood trickled down from the corner of her mouth.\\n\\n She had already thought highly of Fen Tian’s abilities. However, the amount of power displayed by Fen Tian had far exceeded what she expected. After all, the current Tian’er was a lot stronger than Zhou Weiqing when he had fought Fen Tian earlier. A Heavenly God that possessed Saint Energy, coupled with the support from her Saint God Core Nucleus, actually got wounded after two attacks. Evidently, Fen Tian’s Destruction Energy was still much purer than Tian’er’s Saint Energy, even though she had become a Heavenly God. \\n\\n After the Destruction Sword had destroyed the seraph, it paused in mid-air for a brief moment before charging straight towards Tian’er at an increased speed. Fen Tian’s objective was very simple - even if he was unable to hurt Zhou Weiqing, he would want to kill off Tian’er first. Tian’er’s powerful Saint Energy similarly posed a huge threat to him. If she were to join forces with Zhou Weiqing, it would be hard to tell who was going to emerge as the final victor. \\n\\n If Shangguan Tianyang was able to see that Zhou Weiqing was consolidating the eleventh piece of his Legendary Set, naturally, Fen Tian could see that too. At this moment, all he could think about was to destroy him. \\n\\n Hum——\\n\\n Circles of whitish golden light rippled out from Tian’er’s body. A phantom image of a miniature Tian’er gradually appeared on her chest - it was her Saint God Core Nucleus. A ray of Saint light shot out from Tian’er’s chest. A ‘bang’ was heard - it forcefully struck the Destruction Sword. At the same time, Tian’er’s face turned pale and she spat out a mouthful of blood.\\n\\n When Xue AoTian, who was observing from afar, saw that his daughter was hurt, he had panicked immediately. He was about to rush out towards her, but he was stopped by the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya.\\n\\n “Don’t go. This is a battle which we have no means to interfere with. Going over will only lead to your own demise, which will affect your daughter. Zhou Weiqing should be about to launch an attack any time now.” \\n\\n The Destruction Sword was hoisted. Fen Tian snorted coldly; the eight long legs on his back shot out purplish black light rays once again. This time, it was not as simple as just spurting out - the purplish black rays continued to channel into the Destruction Sword. The huge thousand meter long Destruction Sword gradually became transparent. Terrifying energy ripples caused cracks to appear within the Destruction Celestial Territory.\\n\\n Facing the intimidating Destruction Sword that was being hoisted in the air, Tian’er looked extremely weak and tiny. However, she did not cower at all. Circles of powerful white-golden halos continuously erupted from the Saint God Core Nucleus on her chest. No matter what, she had to block this attack - she was not going to allow Fen Tian to harm her man. \\n\\n Bang——, the dense dark purplish light was like a flame that surged up from the Destruction Sword. In an instant, the huge sword’s width had doubled. Endless killing and Destruction aura arose abruptly, as though it was an enormous purplish black mountain that was collapsing on Tian’er. \\n\\n Tian’er had a look of despair in her eyes. Fen Tian had become extremely powerful after refining his Destruction Energy, as well as merging with the Destruction Attribute of several Blood Red Hell and Passion Valley powerhouses. Evidently, his cultivation base had surpassed the Max Level Heavenly God Stage. Even though he did not reach the Heavenly Change Stage, he had at least half his foot in. \\n\\n Under such circumstances, where Tian’er’s Saint Energy was not as pure as the opponent’s Destruction Energy, not to forget the huge difference between their cultivation base, how was she going to carry on the battle? \\n\\n Tian’er knew that perhaps she might be able to block this attack from hurting Zhou Weiqing, but there was a possibility that she might not be able to see her Little Fatty anymore. \\n\\n The huge sword descended from above, bringing along the extremely terrifying Destruction and killing aura with it. It seemed as though this attack could break the entire Boundless Mainland into two. \\n\\n However, the look in Fen Tian’s eyes had suddenly changed at this moment. Without prior warning, a ray of gray light appeared right before his formidable sword.\\n\\n Ding——\\n\\n A crisp sound had erupted in the sky - it did not sound as terrifying as the explosion from before. However, it had caused all the powerhouses who were observing in the sky to descend for about almost a thousand meters before they could regain stability with much difficulty.\\n\\n It was a long gray sword; it was much more slender compared to the Destruction Sword. It was entirely gray and took the form of a crystal, radiating with a gray halo. It seemed to be even sharper than the Destruction Sword.\\n\\n It was not long - it looked as though it was approximately 1.5 meters long. With a huge dueling sword like the Destruction Sword being placed before it, it looked like a speck of dust. However, that speck of dust managed to block the Destruction Sword’s path.\\n\\n The gray sword’s sword light flickered and stretched out over a thousand meters before forcefully blocking the Destruction dueling sword. Both swords reached to a standstill in mid-air. Next, a gray figure quietly appeared in the sky. \\n\\n The gray figure was a hundred meters tall; it was devilishly handsome. It was none other than the Demon God.\\n\\n However, it was different from the one that Zhou Weiqing had metamorphosed. The Demon God that had just appeared was a lot more demonic than the one before. Behind the Demon God, there was another figure who was holding the hands of Tian’er, who had previously been gripped by despair earlier on.\\n\\n This person was covered in a white armor that could be described as majestic and dazzling. The entire armor was in the shade of a crystal clear white. The armor appeared to be extremely thick and heavy. It covered his entire body. There seemed to be an enormous dragon that was constantly cruising within the armor; circles of white-golden halos were continuously being released from it. A mass of distinct nebulae could be seen orbiting on his back - it was indeed the Astral Celestial Territory. This armor actually had a Celestial Territory embedded in it - one could tell how powerful it was.\\n\\n The arms of the armor were exceptionally thick; furthermore, he was holding two hammers - one in each hand. The hammers were not that big. However, it could be clearly seen that the two rays of light that were emitted from them had projected two gigantic hammers, made from energy, that were a hundred meters long onto the sky. It seemed like a Heavenly Skill Image, however, even Fen Tian’s Destruction Celestial Territory was unable to approach the pair of hammers. \\n\\n Right in the center of the white armor, there was a sparkling and clear milky white gem. The gem was in the shape of a human. Upon further scrutiny, wasn’t it Zhou Weiqing, who was sitting cross-legged?\\n\\n Indeed, Zhou Weiqing had completed the final consolidation of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set. The eleven-piece ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set was no longer yellowish golden - it was now white. It was a God Set, a true God Set. The Boundless Infinitum Set was also an eleven-piece set, however it was significantly inferior to the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set.\\n\\n Not only did Zhou Weiqing summon the Demon God’s projection, he had merged himself with it. Hence, it allowed the Demon God’s projection to display a much greater power than before - even the Sword of Demon God was summoned. Just like how Fen Tian enhanced his abilities and power, Zhou Weiqing’s body had undergone changes as well.\\n\\n The Demon God’s body suddenly became illusory. Immediately after, the Sword of Demon God had increased to a hundred meters long in the sky before it landed onto the Demon God’s hand. He gently raised the long sword and forcefully shook off the Destruction Sword.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing did not wait idly in mid-air - he flung the hammer in his left hand into the sky, and swept the hammer in his right hand across. The two hammers met each other and an strong white-golden Saint Energy erupted. His Dual Legendary Hammers merged into one and became a huge hammer with a long handle. \\n\\n The long-handled huge hammer was three meters long, and its huge hammer head was nearly a meter across. Albeit faintly, there was an enormous dragon spiraling above it. Additionally, a crying face and a smiling face flashed alternately. \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s right hand was holding onto the huge hammer, his left hand was holding onto Tian’er’s hand. Tian’er could only feel her aura had merged itself with him into one entity. \\n\\n “If he wants to kill you, he’d have to go over my dead body first.” Zhou Weiqing’s resolute voice rang in Tian’er’s ear. In the next moment, he was in mid-air, standing next to the Demon God.\\n\\n Fen Tian did not continue to attack. Looking at Zhou Weiiqng and the Demon God, his eyes became gloomy. “An eleven-piece God Set. Zhou Weiqing, you sure have a lot of hidden trumps. However, they are all useless. So what if you have the Demon God? Even if you managed to summon the actual Demon God, likewise, I will finish him off today.”\\n\\n As he spoke, Fen Tian waved his right hand. The thousand meter long Destruction Sword swiftly shrunk and transformed into a four foot long sword in his hand in the blink of an eye. \\n\\n The shrunken Destruction Sword became jet-black in color. Zhou Weiqing was unable to describe the feeling that the sword had given him. On the other hand, Fen Tian himself had entirely become black, to the point that his features could no longer be distinguished.\\n\\n At this moment, the Demon God made a move. He was a projection summoned by Zhou Weiqing - once he sensed that Zhou Weiqing was being threatened, he would immediately launch an attack.\\n\\n The Sword of Demon God beckoned towards Fen Tian in a provoking manner. Thereafter, Fen Tian’s black figure appeared out of nowhere. Even Zhou Weiqing, who had mastered the Spatial Law, could not figure out how Fen Tian appeared there.\\n\\n Poof——\\n\\n This time, the size of the sword was reversed.\\n\\n Ding——\\n\\n A crisp sound was heard. The Sword of Demon God was broken…… \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-300-1","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
