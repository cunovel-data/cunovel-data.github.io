{"id":51268,"no":94,"title":"Chapter 24 White Little Tiger (1)","content":"Chapter 24 White Little Tiger (1) After being unconscious for an unknown amount of time, Shangguan Bing’er finally woke up slowly. As she awoke, she felt something throbbing on her face. In a dazed state from just awakening, she subconsciously batted the large rod aside, but who knew, it just rebounded back onto her face. “En?” “En——” Two voices sounded out lightly at the same time, the first being Shangguan Bing’er’s. The next moment, as her consciousness began to awaken, she slowly opened her eyes. By now, dawn was breaking and the sky was being lit by the first glimmer of the sun. The first thing that entered her eyes was an ugly disgusting thing pressed against her little face. It was burning hot and throbbing, and was reddish pink on the tip. “What is that thing? Shangguan Bing’er was still not very clear-headed at the moment, and as she muttered to herself, she slowly raised her head higher. What she saw was Zhou Little Fatty’s wide open eyes and indescribable expression. A chill ran down her spine, and Shangguan Bing’er quickly looked down again. This time, she was fully awake. “Ahhhhh!” “Ahhhhh!” Once again two shrill shrieks rang out simultaneously, and the two who had been pressed tightly together suddenly flew apart like they had been shocked by lightning. Shangguan Bing’er flew upwards and away, while Zhou Weiqing rolled and scrambled behind a large tree. It might sound like a coincidence, but in truth, Zhou Weiqing had been this way for quite a while. Last night, when he had entered the Demonic Change state, all of his normal clothes had been shredded away by the intense energy and his enlarged muscles. His remaining cover, the titanium alloy internal armor had then been destroyed by the Direwolf King. However, at that time, things had been so hectic, in addition to being in the night, and Zhou Weiqing’s body being covered in the black tiger tattoos, thus making it not obvious. Furthermore, at that time, Shangguan Bing’er had been so worried about his survival as well as the Demonic Change’s side effects, that she had not noticed anything amiss. Last night, while Zhou Weiqing had been attempting to breakthrough his Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point, he had been sitting cross legged. In order to help him seal his Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point which had burst open, Shangguan Bing’er naturally had to be right in front of him, and when she fainted, she fell right on top of him. Naturally, this had caused her to fall into that compromising position, resulting in the embarassing scene just a moment ago. Shangguan Bing’er’s lovely face turned red and white, and she said angrily: “Zhou Little Fatty, come out here now!” “No way.” Zhou Weiqing stuck his head out, saying in an aggrieved tone: “Bing’er, I didn’t do anything! You were the one who woke me up!” It was just exactly because Zhou Weiqing did not do it on purpose, and everything had happened once again by coincidence, that caused Shangguan Bing’er to have all that bottled up anger with nowhere to go, and she glared at him. Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh, Bing’er, shouldn’t we head back quickly before discussing that? If you want to hit me, we should find a safer place first, then I’ll let you hit me to your satisfaction.” Shangguan Bing’er started, looking around at the surroundings, and she instantly drew a sharp breath. All around, the ground was littered with direwolf corpses; the direwolves which had went chasing after Bai Jiu and the other Kalise Empire Jewel Masters were nowhere to be found. Perhaps they just had not returned, or were scared off by Zhou Weiqing’s aura and dared not approach. As she thought of the breathtaking dangers of the night before, her anger and embarrassment began to subside; they had managed to survive after all. “Alright, just come out, let’s get out of here first.” Shangguan Bing’er’s tone grew calmer. Zhou Weiqing quickly looked around for several relatively larger pieces of cloth to surround his waist and cover his privates before coming out; though his buttocks were still half revealed, but at least the most embarrassing portions were covered. Shangguan Bing’er stood there a little awkwardly, a blush on her face as she watched that rascal trying to cover himself, a strange light in her eyes. All along, she had known Zhou Little Fatty to be a person very afraid of them, you could even say that ‘Safety First’ was the motto he lived by. Yet, last night, when they were in danger, he did not hesitate to charge down the tree and attempt to draw away all the Forest Direwolves in order to save her. In the end, he had even used his own body as a shield to block the Direwolf King’s attack from finishing her off. Such an action from a person so afraid of death was extremely commendable, and had definitely touched her. No matter what, he was a real man, who dared to stand forward when his woman was in danger. Cheh Cheh! When did I become his woman! Shangguan Bing’er shook her head and blushed, but her look at Zhou Weiqing softened, and she subconsciously touched her face where she had been touched just now, flushing an even deeper red. With much difficulty, Zhou Weiqing finally found a few pieces of cloth to tie around his waist, and managed to cover himself relatively decently. Just as he was about to call out to Shangguan Bing’er to leave, he suddenly felt something furry brush against his feet. Looking down, Zhou Weiqing’s gaze was transfixed. He saw a furry little thing, a full body of white with faint blue markings all over, with its body length less than one foot long, and it was rubbing against his left foot. “What is this thing?” Zhou Weiqing bent down, grabbing the furry little creature and picking it up. “Bing’er, look, what is this?” Picking up the furry little thing, Zhou Weiqing finally got a good look at it, realising that it was actually a little tiger cub! It’s round little head had the word ‘King’ grown in with deep blue fur, right smack in the centre. Although its white body lined with blue was rather small, but it definitely had the proportion and look of a tiger, except for its fur colour being extremely rare. Its large eyes were also a deep blue, and being grabbed by the scruff of its neck by Zhou Weiqing, it gave out several discontented meowls. “Wahhh! Such a cute little thing!” When Shangguan Bing’er saw the little tiger, her eyes lit up and she quickly walked over. Zhou Weiqing blinked and said: “This little thing, could it be a Heavenly Beast? But, why is it so tiny? Is it a newborn?” Shangguan Bing’er said: “I’ve never seen or heard of such a white little tiger, but I’m sure it should be a type of Heavenly Beast. Little Fatty, you’ve really lucked out this time! A Heavenly Beast youngling can be raised, and when it grows older, it can help you fight, and even protect you. Furthermore, tigers are considered the king of beasts, even the weakest tiger-type Heavenly Beast have the possibility of reaching the Zun Stage. You really should take good care of it! Hmmm, but it’s so small, how did it get here, where are its parents?” On hearing that, Zhou Weiqing’s expression changed. “Let’s run, this little thing’s parents might come looking for us once they discover that their child is missing, then we’d be in deep trouble!” Shangguan Bing’er’s heart was also struck by a sudden chill; although she did not know what type of Heavenly Beast this white little tiger was, but she could imagine how strong its parents were. Without hesitation, both of them picked up their Purple Dawn Bows and ran off at top speed back to the Heavenly Bow Empire’s camp.
