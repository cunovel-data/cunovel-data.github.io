Advancing to the Heavenly King Stage was after all not an easy feat; she wasn’t like Tian’er, who had the direct help of the extremely pure Saint Energy, hence she had to undergo one more process. \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing brought the three women with him and descended to the ground. He let out a long sigh upon reaching the ground. As he was holding Tian’er close to him, he lightly pecked her on her forehead.\\n\\n If not for Tian’er’s timely arrival, he would have suffered serious injuries. Once there was a problem with his soul, he would end up heading towards his demise no matter how remarkable his Saint Energy was. Even though the power of the Astral Feedback was great, it should only be used at the right time! \\n\\n Although the ascension process was a success, Zhou Weiqing felt somewhat physically and mentally exhausted. \\n\\n As for today’s battle, it might seem as though he was in full control of the situation, but in reality, he had put in a laborious amount of effort, making sure that every step was flawless, or it would have been disastrous - especially at the start, if he did not lure the strong man from Blood Red Hell by surrendering, he wouldn’t have been able to attain the solo fight opportunity.\\n\\n Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue walked over together. When Long Shiya looked at his precious disciple, his eyes was filled with endless radiance - he couldn’t have been more satisfied and happy.\\n\\n Wu Yunyue was all smiles, he bowed slightly towards Zhou Weiqing and said, “Weiqing, no words can describe my gratitude towards your favor. I agree to the suggestion you brought up previously.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing forced a smile and said, “Alright, let’s talk about it when we get back. I want to take a rest for a bit.”\\n\\n When the three women next to him saw how exhausted he looked, their hearts couldn’t help but ache for him. Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er looked at each other then said to him, “You should go back with Tian’er first, we will look after our little sister here.” \\n\\n “Alright.” Zhou Weiqing nodded his head. At this moment, he felt as though he couldn’t open his eyes.\\n\\n The overconsumption of his energy and the whole process of evolution caused his body to be physically and mentally drained. All he wanted to do right now was to have a good sleep. \\n\\n After getting back to the Heavenly Bow City, Zhou Weiqing knocked out almost immediately upon entering his room. This slumber of his would probably last for a full day and night.\\n\\n Heavenly Bow Empire got down to work immediately. They did their best in delaying all the information pertaining to battle earlier, such that Blood Red Hell would receive them as late as possible. At the same time, Shangguan Xue’er was to personally write and deliver a letter to Heaven’s Expanse Palace, reporting the entire situation on their side to them. However it was unknown what made Shangguan Xue’er decide to hide the most important information pertaining to Zhou Weiqing’s evolution to the Heavenly Emperor Stage. Perhaps, subconsciously, after Zhou Weiqing got rid of that burden of hers, she regarded herself as one of his people. \\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er was still in the midst of a breakthrough; even when Zhou Weiqing had woken up from his slumber, it still had not ended. \\n\\n “It feels so good.” After a good stretch, Zhou Weiqing woke up. “”Hm, nope.” Instinctively, he hurriedly masked his own aura and opened his eyes wide before scanning his surroundings. \\n\\n Tian’er, who was laying next to him, got woken up by his sudden movements. She looked at Zhou Weiqing and burst out laughing, “If you stretch even more, our bedroom is going to transform into coal ash.” \\n\\n As it turns out, as Zhou Weiqing just evolved, he still could not grasp full control over his aura. When he stretched his body earlier, it immediately caused the atmospheric energy to undergo changes. Vast amounts of atmospheric energy came surging, if he had not acted in the nick of time, the building would have been destroyed as a result of the overly dense and compressed atmospheric energy.\\n\\n Looking at the sweet smiling Tian’er next to him, Zhou Weiqing lightly embraced her. \\n\\n “Thank you, Tian’er. If not for you, I’m afraid……” \\n\\n Tian’er looked angrily at him, “Do we have to be so courteous with each other? As long as you don’t abandon me when you run out, we’re good.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing carefully placed his hand on Tian’er’s belly and said, “Our child’s doing ok, right?”\\n\\n Tian’er nodded slightly and placed her hand on top of Zhou Weiqing’s hand. Her face couldn’t help but have a motherly glow. \\n\\n “Our precious child is not only completely fine, he is much more active now. Previously he barely made any movements, but now, he would wiggle around every now and then. What exactly happened to the Saint Energy the other day? Why would our child emit such a pure energy? It seemed to be much purer than the Saint Energy emitted after your evolution to Heavenly Emperor Stage was completed.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing forced a smile and said, “I don’t know either. But I am positive that if my Saint Energy could be transformed into something so pure, then it will definitely transform into something that surpasses the Heavenly God Stage. I had always thought that I was considered gifted, but right now from the looks of it, I’m far from it compared to our precious child! This little fella has not been born into this world yet but he’s already so formidable. When he’s born, wouldn’t he surpass my power?” \\n\\n Both of them looked at each other, they were somewhat bewildered. To say that a newborn child would possess powers that are above that of Heavenly God Stage was practically unbelievable, but the extremely pure Saint Energy previously was could not be faked. \\n\\n Zhou Weiqing knew that even his father-in-law Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord could not give him the answer to the problem pertaining to the sudden appearance of the pure Saint Energy around his child.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laid down again, while embracing Tian’er. He was suddenly up to mischief - he lowered his head and whispered into Tian’er’s ear, “Honey, I wanna go in and take a look at our baby.”\\n\\n “You’re so bad……” Tian’er felt so shy that her face went red.\\n\\n “I definitely will be careful. You see, you guys did not accompany me for the past couple of days, I am so miserable! Come on……”\\n\\n Love was in the air; a pregnant woman would similarly yearn for love, sometimes even more passionately than regular women. Zhou Weiqing’s gentleness, coupled with his tender and melodious voice, caused the room to be filled with love in an instant.\\n\\n Heavenly Bow Empire Marshal’s assembly hall.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing commanded his people to invite Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue over. Now that the key battle had ended, some matters also ought to be carried out. Additionally, this was the main reason why Zhou Weiqing rushed back. What he said to Di Fengling at that time was not a joke - it was his dream. \\n\\n Even though the Heavenly Bow Empire already had a rather strong army, they were after all a small country - it did not have a profound heritage. Zhou Weiqing was not overly ambitious, but he really wanted his motherland to grow a lot stronger. And for it to grow a lot stronger, it depended on its power. \\n\\n If the Heavenly Bow Empire could possess its own Saint Land, who would have the guts to attack it in future? And that’s not all - Zhou Weiqing wanted to build something similar to Skill Storing Palace and Consolidating Equipment Pavilion within Heavenly Bow Empire. Perhaps the given short period of time was insufficient to attract a huge number of Heavenly Jewel Masters, but for the sake of the development of a country and its future, they were indispensable. \\n\\n Wu Yunyue was all smiles - he walked into the hall and smilingly said to Zhou Weiqing, “Weiqing, are you well-rested? Is everything fine with you?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed, “Everything’s fine. Or else I wouldn’t have invited you over that quickly.”\\n\\n In reality, Wu Yunyue had already sensed the fluctuation of Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Emperor Stage energy, the moment he woke up. Thereafter, that little fella dilly dallied for almost 4 hours and he called that quick? \\n\\n Of course, Wu Yunyue was not intending to expose him - in his eyes, that fella Zhou Weiqing still had his shortcomings, such as the fact that he was rather lustful. However, in any world, the strong heroes would always be accompanied with a woman by his side. This was also the same in the world of Heavenly Beasts - the stronger the Heavenly Beast, the more companions it would have. Without a doubt, Zhou Weiqing was strong enough. If he only had one woman, Wu Yunyue would have found it weird instead.\\n\\n Wu Yunyue cut to the chase and said, “Weiqing, I had already said it to you before, I have agreed to the suggestion you brought up previously. After we had defeated the group of people from Blood Red Hell, I had anxiously discussed with everyone from Heavenly Demon Sect, in which they all had agreed. This time, you can entrust everything to us without worrying.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed, “Senior, you’re too kind. In that case, there is definitely no problem on my end. As for the new name of our Heavenly Demon Sect, what do you suggest we should change it to?”\\n\\n When Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue heard Zhou Weiqing use the word ‘our’, the smile on his face became wider. He had already given up his control over Heavenly Demon Sect, why would care about naming it?\\n\\n “Sect Leader, it’s better for you to name it. Needless to say, I want to be assistant Sect Leader! Hehe.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled to himself. This old fox, ultimately he still could not let go of his power entirely, but this was expected as a matter of course. \\n\\n “I had thought about it before, I could start out by styling it after my Peerless Battalion, which was later renamed to Peerless Regiment. Even though our Physical Jewel Masters make up the majority, Peerless Battalion was formed to resist Heavenly Jewel Masters. Since we are merging with the Heavenly Demon Sect, let’s just name it Peerless Sect. What do you think?”\\n\\n “Peerless Sect?” Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue sighed to himself. He knew that if he gave the confirmation, Heavenly Demon Sect would become a thing of the history. However, he did not have any other choice. If he collaborated with Zhou Weiqing, he could at least keep his dignity and maintain the legacy of the Heavenly Demon Sect. If he were to give up on this collaboration, even if the Blood Red Hell didn’t make a move, the other Great Saint Lands wouldn’t spare the Heavenly Demon Sect either. \\n\\n Looking at the emotional struggle in the Demonic Emperor’s eyes, Zhou Weiqing was not anxious at all. After all, changing the name and leader of a generation of Saint Land that one built would not be easy for anyone else.\\n\\n “Father-in-law, there is one more matter I’d like to discuss with you. Yuehan had already given herself to me, and I will definitely take responsibility for her. Also, I really like her, and all my significant others came from Saint Lands; I can’t favor any of them over the others. Here’s my plan - there isn’t much time left before the Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands. I would like to hold the wedding ceremony after it ends and marry all of them, giving them equal statuses as my wives, without any ranking. What do you think?”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-272-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
