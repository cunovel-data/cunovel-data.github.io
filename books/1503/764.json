{"id":51938,"no":764,"title":"Chapter 259: Beating Up Father-In-Law? (2)","content":"Shangguan Bing’er glanced apologetically at Zhou Weiqing, then shrugged helplessly and obediently followed her mother away.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing stared blankly, then cast his father-in-law a sidelong glance. Both of them hunched over slightly, looking like a pair of roosters who had just been beaten as they followed the two women into Heaven’s Expanse Palace.\\n\\n Heaven’s Expanse Palace. The meeting hall.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyang was seated up high. Because Tang Xian and his daughter were both present, Shangguan Tianyue didn’t sit down. Instead, he led Zhou Weiqing over to stand nearby.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyang looked at Zhou Weiqing, then smiled. “Weiqing, I didn’t expect you to complete the mission so soon. Just a short while ago, the Luster Spatial Realm became completely calm. It seems as though we can cease our preparations for the evacuation of Zhongtian City. Tell me about what happened at the Xuantian Continent. I’m very interested to hear what happened.”\\n\\n Only now did Zhou Weiqing understand that it was the changes in the Luster Spatial Realm which resulted in them knowing he had succeeded in summoning the two great dragons. He immediately began to narrate the story, starting with him and Bing’er sailing the vast seas. He told the story simply, but he naturally held back on the affair between himself and Dongfang Hanyue.\\n\\n The Shangguan brothers couldn’t help but reveal looks of amazement as they heard Zhou Weiqing’s story. According to what Zhou Weiqing had just said, Xuantian Palace’s total power was probably above the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. If nothing else, they had six Heavenly Emperors and a Heavenly God-level Tenebrous Demon Dragon. Those alone made it impossible for Heaven’s Expanse Palace to compare to them, as it didn’t have any Heavenly God powerhouses.\\n\\n But of course, if the two Great Saint Lands were to actually battle each other, it wouldn’t be easy for Xuantian Palace to win. In Heaven’s Expanse Palace, Heavenly Kings were as common as the clouds. This was the main reason why they were able to suppress Heavenly Snow Mountain in might.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyang nodded repeatedly as he listened to Zhou Weiqing’s story. “Weiqing, I shall thank you on behalf of Heaven’s Expanse Palace. What you accomplished was something incredible for Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the entire Zhongtian Empire. Even though I’ve always viewed you as one of us, I cannot let your accomplishments and the merits you rendered go unrewarded. If there is anything you need, just tell me. So long as Heaven’s Expanse Palace can accomplish it, I definitely will not refuse.”\\n\\n He was the Palace Lord of Heaven’s Expanse. If others were to hear Shangguan Tianyang saying such words, the entire Boundless Mainland would be stunned.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing chuckled. “Can I make two requests?”\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyang smiled. “Go ahead. I won’t give you any money, but everything else is negotiable.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing secretly cursed the man for being a sly old fox. He said I can ask for anything I want, but apparently we still have to negotiate it. He really has an airtight defense!\\n\\n “First, I wish for the Zhongtian Empire to support the Heavenly Bow Empire. When we need aid, I hope that the Zhongtian Empire won’t be stingy with it.”\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyang nodded without even hesitating. “Fine. I accept.” Helping their minor ally, the Heavenly Bow Empire, gradually become strong was to the benefit of the Zhongtian Empire. There was no excuse for him not to agree.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said, “Second, I would like to solemnly offer a proposition of marriage. Please officiate the wedding ceremony for myself and Xue’er, Fei’er, and Bing’er.”\\n\\n When these words came out, Tang Xian’s first response was to glare wide-eyed at Zhou Weiqing. As for Shangguan Tianyue, he frowned slightly but didn’t say anything. Be it due to Zhou Weiqing’s achievements, his existing relationship with the three, or his talent and his unfathomable future prospects, there was no excuse for Shangguan Tianyue to refuse this marriage proposal.\\n\\n But… of the three Shangguan sisters, Fei’er and Bing’er weren’t an issue, while Shangguan Xue’er was the heir to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. To marry her to an outsider wouldn’t necessarily be a good thing for the palace.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyang hesitated slightly, then said, “Weiqing, from a practical standpoint, I have no reason to refuse. Everything you have done for Heaven’s Expanse Palace, combined with the fact that they already love you, would normally compel me to agree. However… as you know, Xue’er is our choice to be the next Palace Lord. As a result, she is extraordinarily important to Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s future. If she marries you, who shall be the heir to Heaven’s Expanse Palace?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing chortled. “That’s actually easy to solve. You and milord father-in-law are as healthy and hale as you were in the spring of your youth. You should be able to live for another century or two with no problem at all. Although Xue’er is your heir, she won’t have to assume the position anytime soon. If you agree to let her marry me, I agree that the first child I have with any of the three can be the heir to Heaven’s Expanse Palace.”\\n\\n The faces of the two Shangguan brothers instantly turned rather odd. This little bastard really knows how to take advantage of someone. It sounded like what he was saying was reasonable, but if that really happened then it meant the next Palace Lord of Heaven’s Expanse Palace would be his child. It would be fair to say that he would essentially be in control of Heaven’s Expanse Palace!\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyue let out an irritated snort, while Shangguan Tianyang laughed. “It isn’t impossible for us to take your suggestion into consideration… but Xue’er, Fei’er, and Bing’er are the children of my second brother and his wife. I can’t make this decision on my own. How about this? As long as you can convince your mother-in-law, I won’t object.”\\n\\n Upon hearing this, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes bulged out. Damn you. Isn’t this legendary technique, ‘throwing the hot potato to someone else’? But there was nothing he could do save to turn and look pitifully at Tang Xian.\\n\\n Tang Xian glared at him. “Don’t even think about it, unless you do what I just asked you to do and kick that old fart’s ass. Hmph.”\\n\\n This was a clear refusal. Shangguan Tianyue had been famous for many years and was an awesome figure even amongst Heavenly Emperors. He had recently ascended to become a middle stage Heavenly Emperor. Zhou Weiqing didn’t have any desire to go beat up his father-in-law, but even if he did, how could he possibly be strong enough to?\\n\\n Tang Xian was getting increasingly unhappy with this brat, which was why she had made such an unreasonable demand. Shangguan Bing’er could see that Zhou Weiqing’s face was growing increasingly ugly, but she herself could do nothing but pull at her mother’s clothes nervously. Tang Xian, however, didn’t seem inclined to back down at all.\\n\\n In the end, it was Shangguan Tianyang who broke the silence. “Sister-in-law, don’t hold a grudge against my second brother. I suggest we resolve this matter like this. Weiqing is a junior; there’s no way we can have him go beat up my second brother. Let’s have them spar instead? If he can withstand my second brother for a joss stick of time without being defeated, the two of you shall no longer make trouble for him and let all him marry all three of them. If he isn’t able to hold on for that long… well, we can’t completely tear their relationships apart. I’ll make the decision on behalf of Fei’er and Bing’er and still allow Weiqing to marry them, but we’ll keep Xue’er behind to inherit my position as Palace Lord. What do you think?”\\n\\n When he saw that ‘honest’ and ‘selfless’ look on Shangguan Tianyang’s face, Zhou Weiqing really did want to flip this ‘Senior Uncle’ the middle finger. It sounded like he was being reasonable and trying to find a middle ground for both sides, but in reality he was trying to befriend Zhou Weiqing while keeping Xue’er as his heir. Zhou Weiqing’s demonstrated abilities had become increasingly dazzling, after all, and he didn’t want to offend Zhou Weiqing too much. An extra enemy like him could cause tremendous trouble for the palace in the future.\\n\\n In addition, preventing a marriage wasn’t something you could simply do at will. What if all three of the Shangguan sisters ended up running away? They would’ve ended up with neither the chicken nor the egg! Shangguan Tianyang had long ago decided to marry Fei’er and Bing’er to him, but as for Xue’er? She herself was something who knew the importance of keeping an eye on the big picture. Just a short while ago, Shangguan Tianyang had a long private talk with her, and Shangguan Xue’er had expressed her willingness to remain at Heaven’s Expanse Palace and continue to be his heir.\\n\\n It could be said that ever since he had returned, Zhou Weiqing had fallen into Shangguan Tianyang’s trap. It couldn’t be said that this was a fait accompli, but the writing was on the wall.\\n\\n Tang Xian didn’t say a word. She was a clever person, and she knew what Shangguan Tianyang’s intentions were. Keeping at least one of her precious girls safe was better than the alternative!\\n\\n The Shangguan brothers exchanged a glance. Shangguan Tianyue naturally knew what his big brother was intending. He nodded slightly… and so, everyone’s gazes were focused upon Zhou Weiqing. They were awaiting his response.\\n\\n In truth, even Shangguan Tianyang was a bit nervous. If Zhou Weiqing was to refuse and left in a huff, Heaven’s Expanse Palace would be in a very tricky situation. No matter what, he had been their major benefactor. If Zhou Weiqing was angered and didn’t marry the three Shangguan sisters, then in the future the Heavenly Bow Empire probably wouldn’t be on good terms with the Zhongtian Empire. In addition, the mainland had undergone earthshattering changes during the year in which he had been gone. Even the Zhongtian Empire was in grave danger. They were in desperate need of an ally like the Heavenly Bow Empire.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing narrowed his eyes as he sensed everyone look at him. He balled his hands into fists, and a hint of golden light flickered within his calm, glossy eyes. “Very well. I accept.”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-259-02","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
