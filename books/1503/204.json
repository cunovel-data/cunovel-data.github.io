However, he was quickly forced to stop laughing embarrassedly, as no one had joined it. However, all the students were staring at him, as if something was ignited in their gazes.\n With a cough, he continued: “Everyone, don’t stare at me like that, I will feel shy. Come on, it’s time for class, everyone sit down.” As he said that, he headed towards his own seat.\n “Weiqing, go to the Principal’s office, she is looking for you.” Ming Hua’s voice rang out.\n Zhou Weiqing started momentarily, turning to look at Ming Hua. All the students also turned their gazes towards her, and instantly the atmosphere in the class turned nervous.\n Ming Hua furrowed her brow and said: “Everyone, do not worry. I can guarantee that nothing will happen to your monitor. Although this matter is a little troublesome, but our Principal is after all the Princess of our Empire, and not someone the nobles can easily trifle with.”\n “Boss, we’ll go with you.” Kou Rui said excitedly.\n Zhou Weiqing turned back around to face his classmates, and with a peaceful gaze he said calmly: “Very good, we now truly feel like a real team, a family. As for going with me, it isn’t necessary. After all, Teacher Ming Hua has already said that nothing would happen right? I’ll be back soon, you guys study hard, it is class time after all. Stop standing around, all of you sit down.” As he said the last line, he glared at them, and the rest of the commoner students finally settled down.\n Ming Hua sighed to herself inwardly as she sat behind the podium, thinking. Perhaps, this class might turn into the best class that the Academy has ever taught. This Zhou Weiqing is really something, this is true unity. For a class of students to truly unite, there needs to be a core, a heart, and this core was apparently not herself, the teacher, but instead Zhou Weiqing. Of course, in order to become this core, he had also done a lot, so much that even though Ming Hua felt a little envious, the emotion she felt the most was admiration. As she settled her various personal feelings about Zhou Weiqing and calmed down, she could analyse the entire situation, and see why her father and brother looked so highly upon him.\n As Zhou Weiqing left the classroom alone, he calmed himself down and walked slowly towards the Principal’s office. At the same time, he pondered what could be the possible outcomes.\n It was unlikely that Ming HUa would lie to him about the situation, after all she had stated it in front of the entire class.\n That was to say… the beautiful lady Principal would protect him. However, at the same time, as Ming Hua and Ye Paopao had mentioned, it would not be easy for her to withstand all the pressure from so many nobles. It looks like he would have to give something up, perhaps get a slightly heavier punishment. This was likely the reason Principal Cai Cai was looking for him.\n He could deal with a bigger punishment without any problems, after all that did not affect his overall plan. Zhou Weiqing quickly smiled. Since he had gotten Yun Li and Lin TianAo as Followers yesterday, and seen the unity of his classmates today, his mood was currently extremely good. As such, he was not troubled by the upcoming punishment.\n When Zhou Weiqing reached the fourth level where the Principal’s office was, he just happened to see a group of noble students dressed in their splendid uniforms walking down the stairs, looking glum and dissatisfied. Without question, these were the ones who had tried to lodge a complaint against him. Looking at their expressions, Zhou Weiqing was certain of his guess, that the Principal would not submit to them.\n Knocking twice on the door, he tidied his uniform unhurriedly, his usual honest smile appearing on his face. Whether or not others would believe it was one matter, but he would always maintain his act.\n “Come in.” Cai Cai’s solemn voice rang out from within.\n Zhou Weiqing pushed open the door and entered.\n Cai Cai was not alone in her office, and Dean Xiao Shi was also there, seemingly deep in discussion with her.\n As soon as Zhou Weiqing entered, Cai Cai’s expression sank, and she turned to Xiao Shi and said: “Dean Xiao, let’s continue this later. Indeed, our Academy’s customs needs to be stricter. If there are any more fights, no matter what status both sides are, we will expel both sides.”\n Xiao Shi gave a respectful bow of agreement before turning to leave. As he passed by Zhou Weiqing, he gave a helpless smile. This incident had also put a lot of pressure on him. After all, he was the Dean of Students, and the discipline of the school was also part of his responsibilities. Many of the nobles could not do anything to the Princess, and instead turned to put pressure on him. If not for Cai Cai’s support, he might have been in deep trouble.\n As Xiao Shi left, Zhou Weiqing advanced forward a few steps with a big smile on his face. With a courtly bow, he said: “Good morning, Principal.”\n Cai Cai gave a cold humph and said: “You troublemaker, do you know how much problems you have caused to the academy with your actions?”\n Zhou Weiqing said honestly: “It is all my fault, I am so sorry to have caused the Principal and the academy so much trouble. If there needs to be any further punishment, please punish me alone. It was I who couldn’t stand it and instigated my classmates to take action. I just beg that I have the chance to continue staying here to learn, and not expel me. I still have mmuch to study and learn.”\n The Zhou Weiqing now was looking totally sincere and honest, with his expression holding just a hint of depression from being wronged. That look wa smiles apart from that overjoyed and smug look he had last night after getting two great Followers.\n Originally, Cai Cai had called in Zhou Weiqing to give him a big scolding before getting on to the main matter. However, with him admitting his mistakes, apologising and willing to take up the responsibility and any extra punishments, she couldn’t help but feel her heart soften.\n Everything else aside, just the fact that Zhou Weiqing was willing to take the punishment on behalf of his classmates was extremely admirable, and that willingness to shoulder responsibility and admitting fault was also something she appreciated.\n As such, Principal Cai Cai’s expression eased up a little, and she said passively: “I hear that you are the class monitor of commoner class one?”\n Zhou Weiqing nodded, his eyes reddening as he said: “Yes, my classmates have honoured me. Principal, please do not worry, I will not make things difficult for you. When I go back to class, I will resign my post, I just hope that you do not expel me.” Although he said that, our dear Little Fatty was grinning inside his heart. He was highly experienced at taking beatings from his father since a young age, and without even using his eyes, he could just tell from Cai Cai’s tone that she had already softened and was on his side. This was likely to result in anything bad for him today.\n “Nonsense, what making things difficult for me.” Cai Cai exclaimed angrily. “Yesterday, I have already made my decision on the matter, and I will not change it. Do they think that they can pressure me with just the few of them? This is the Fei Li Royal Family Military Academy, not their nobles’ backyard!”\n Zhou Weiqing wisely kept his mouth shut at this point in time. Things seemed to be going pretty well, and no matter what he said now, it might actually have an adverse effect.\n Cai Cai stood up from behind her desk, slowly walking out. Although Zhou Weiqing had his head bowed down, he was still able to see her beautiful and graceful figure. Is she really thirty-five years old? Even a twenty five year old might not be able to compete! He couldn’t help but think to himself. This rascal had a zero immune system towards beauty, and couldn’t help but swallow a large gulp of saliva. Both of them were princesses, but comparing Difuya and Cai Cai’s aura and they way they carried themselves, it was just like night and day.\n Cai Cai walked towards Zhou Weiqing and said: “I have already shouldered this matter, and the nobles will not dare to come to the academy grounds to cause trouble. However, I will not be able to stop them from doing anything underhand. After all, I can’t possibly send a few men to guard you around the clock. This time, you are way too obvious of a target. Just like you said, you were the one who instigated it. Do not think that you can try to trick me with a few words, I have already understood the entire matter. However, since you still seem sincere in apologising and admitting your mistakes, and the matter is already settled, I will not give you any further punishment. However, in order to ensure your safety, you will have to leave the academy for a short while.”\n “Ahh? No!” Zhou Weiqing was stunned in his heart, not expecting that Cai Cai would actually ask him to leave. At this point, they were barely two yards apart, and this rascal leapt forward towards Cai Cai, hugging her feet, sobbing as he said: “Principal, don’t expel me!! I know I’m wrong… please let me stay…”\n Cai Cai had never expected that Zhou Weiqing would suddenly pounce on her out of the sudden, and actually was too surprised to react. In her thirty over years of living, this was the first time she had been so close to a man, and in that instant, she was stunned into silence.\n In truth, Zhou Weiqing had not expected to hug Cai Cai. After all, it had been an involuntary reaction, and also he knew she was extremely powerful. After hugging her, Zhou Weiqing’s weak willpower regarding females instantly changed again, after all Cai Cai was only wearing a thin teacher’s robe, and her slim legs were in his arms, even the feel of them through the robes caused this rascal to bleed from the nose… and onto the robes.\n Wow, that was so awesome! The sweet scent from Cai Cai caused Zhou Weiqing to put his face onto her leg, as he started crying in such a heartbroken manner. After all, do not forget who his teacher is… a man with the nickname of God Eye Scoundrel!\n Mu En had once told him that in front of those weaker than him, he had to take control, but in front of those clearly stronger than him, he had to be shameless. This was especially so with women. Naturally, our dear Student Little Fatty was following his teacher’s instructions, and was enjoying it as he did so.\n “Let go of me!” Cai Cai cried out. After a moment of shock where she didn’t do anything, her beautiful face flushed totally red, forgetting all about her power, and only just pushing Zhou Weiqing’s head away from her legs.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-8-chapter-62-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
