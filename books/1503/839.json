{"id":52013,"no":839,"title":"Chapter 285 - Luring Ink With Saint Energy, Consolidating In The Void (3)","content":"The civilians did not have the slightest clue pertaining to what Zhou Weiqing was doing, and neither did the Heavenly Jewel Masters. Only the cultivators who were at least of the Heavenly King Stage could vaguely guess what was going on. However, the more they guessed, the more shocked they were. What exactly was this Consolidating Equipment Scroll? It actually required such an extreme method to create it. Additionally, its Consolidating Ink was that mystical as well, it took the form of a dragon. \n Zhou Weiqing’s actions were steady. The emerald green light in the sky gradually expanded and slowly took shape. Every stroke was continuous, there were absolutely no pauses. Occasionally, distorted light would appear, causing the green light to retract before expanding again.\n Down below, Duan Tianlang had recovered his mental strength with the help of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy. He flew up into the sky thereafter. Even though he could not get too close due to the Astral Subsidence, he was still able to see everything clearly from afar. \n Rhythm, rhythm. Duan Tianlang thought to himself. He was much more nervous compared to everyone else, including Zhou Weiqing. The success or failure was being determined by the current step. The crafting of the Consolidating Ink had an unprecedented success, the blood given by the Sidhe Empress was very pure as well - every valuable treasure amalgamated perfectly together, and even protected the Jade Tide. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s consolidation process still looked rather promising. Of course he knew that every reversal made was a result of Zhou Weiqing utilizing Time Reversal to regain control of the process. The control had already reached the point of perfection.\n Perhaps a very experienced God Tier Master might be able to complete it in one stroke, but Zhou Weiqing clearly could not do that. Hence, not only did he need the cultivation base of a Heavenly God, he needed the cultivation base of a strong one at that. He would only be able to continuously use Time Reversal throughout the whole process, keep the rhythm and craft the scroll with sufficient support. Although he had not reached the standard where he was crafting it perfectly and effortlessly, at the very least there were absolutely no hiccups at the moment - that itself made Duan Tianlang heave a sigh of relief. Everything was on the right track. What he needed to do at the moment was to wait for Zhou Weiqing to complete a miracle. Once it was successful, Duan Tianlang would be able to confidently say that this disciple nephew of his would definitely be the strongest cultivator in the world in less than ten years.\n However at this moment, outside of Heavenly Bow City, a group of dark shadows flew over at a high speed. There weren’t many of them, just seven, but their speed could be compared to flickering light and passing shadows - it was as though every time their figures flashed, they had moved a hundred meters. They were moving as fast as if they were flying. Additionally, from the energy aura emitted from their bodies, they were definitely equipped with the ability to fly.\n The seven figures were completely decked in black clothes. The auras emitted by them were filled with darkness and destruction. If any ordinary person were to get near them, even without being attacked, they would fall very ill as a result of such aura. \n “Consolidating in the void - this is the method to create the eleventh piece. We must stop him. Duan Tianlang actually had such an ability?” The hoarse voice of the person right in front was heard. \n Upon close inspection, one would notice that the figures of the seven people were very slim and petite. As they moved through the sky, they did not give off any energy ripple at all. \n “No. 1, our mission today is to kill Zhou Weiqing. Let’s not create any more problems on top of our existing one,” said a person in black, who was following closely behind. \n “What do you know? Eh, the fella who is consolidating isn’t Duan Tianlang.” At this moment, the seven men in black had already arrived outside the city. At one glance, they were able to tell that the person in the midst of consolidating was Zhou Weiqing. When they saw Zhou Weiqing’s method of consolidating, luring the ink in the void, a tinge of shock appeared in their eyes that were emitting black flames.\n “There is no need to argue - it is Zhou Weiqing who is performing the consolidation.” No. 1 took out a drawing from his chest. It was Zhou Weiqing’s face.\n They could clearly see every single Heavenly King and Emperor in the sky. Every single man in black concealed their aura immediately. However, they still felt suffocated by the Astral Subsidence in the sky.\n “No. 1, what is going on? How is it possible that Zhou Weiqing is emitting such a powerful aura? Is it a Celestial Territory? There must be an error in our intel.”\n “No. 2, you’re too timid. Do you think it’s that easy to lure the ink in the void? If I’m not wrong, this Consolidating Ink had to cost them a lot. It is impossible for Zhou Weiqing to stop, or else they would not have stationed that many people around him for defense purposes. We have already lived for more than a thousand years, if not for Fen Tian reviving us, we would be a pile of bones right now. At this time, you’re still calculating your personal gains and losses? Did you think that we can still keep our lives without completing the task? Without Fen Tian’s destructive energy, we will definitely die. We definitely have a chance. Based on our intel, the strongest person here should be Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya. If the seven of us launch a combined attack on him, we have a huge chance of beating them.”\n The other five men did not utter a single word, standing behind the two leaders like sculptures, quietly waiting.\n After a moment of silence, No. 2 nodded, “Alright. However, No. 1, please remember - amongst the people who were revived, there are extremely few with intelligence. Since the heavens gave us a chance at a whole new life, I don’t intend to lose it here. If things go south, I’d rather use them as scapegoats and flee far away.”\n “Do you think I want to die? We have no time to lose. Get ready. We only have one chance. Besides, we cannot let Zhou Weiqing feel threatened,” said No. 1.\n After No. 1 and No. 2 had their secret discussion, the seven men started moving again.\n The seven men quickly got in line. The five men who did not utter a single word stood right in front, and No. 1 and No. 2 were at the back. Rays of black light gradually emitted from the seven men. If one looked closely, most of the light came from No. 1 and No. 2 and the other five men only released theirs after. \n The rays of black light gradually condensed. What was weird was that those rays of light were similar to the Starlight Saint Energy released by Zhou Weiqing earlier. There were absolutely no aura fluctuations. That was also to say, it was impossible to sense anything the men in black did. Otherwise, they would not be that bold, condensing their energy that openly.\n In order to ensure that the Astral Celestial Territory was enhancing his own body, he limited its sphere to the skies of Heavenly Bow City, and they happened to be outside of it. Even though these men in black were slightly affected by the Astral Celestial Territory, they did not set foot within it at all.\n They had no idea how Zhou Weiqing killed the people sent by the Blood Red Hell. However, Zhou Weiqing possessing Saint Energy was no longer a secret. No. 1 and No. 2 clearly knew that even though their energy could condense, concentrate, and even conceal, if it were to come in contact with the Saint Energy that was completely different, Zhou Weiqing would notice it immediately. It was just like how they were able to use their destructive aura to detect Zhou Weiqing’s creative Saint Energy. Hence, they chose to hide in the dark corner.\n All the black light slowly condensed together, sticking closely to the city walls, scaling it like a Boston ivy. Thorns that looked like long legs with joints started appearing. Thereafter, they returned to being artery-shaped. Anybody who saw it would feel nauseous immediately.\n When these black veins had climbed to the top of the wall, they slowly gathered, merging into an enormous mass. Thereafter, the black mass branched out, taking on the shape of a crab.\n As the originators, the seven men had already been completely covered by the black light.\n The giant crab that was formed entirely from black light rays did not seem that huge. It had a diameter of approximately a meter. However at one glance, one would realize that it was like a black hole, it could even swallow light rays.\n The two turtles in front of the huge crab slowly explored the outside of the city walls. Even though there were soldiers on the city walls, their gazes were fixated on Zhou Weiqing who was luring the ink with Saint Energy and consolidating in the void. Nobody had noticed the two ordinary lumps of black light. \n The two turtles gradually merged. Suddenly, a ray of black light that was filled with nirvana headed straight for Zhou Weiqing in the sky. \n Just like before, the black light did not give prior warning. There were absolutely no aura fluctuations during its process of flying towards Zhou Weiqing. \n However, just when the black light entered the city and into the sphere of the Astral Celestial Territory, countless people reacted at the same time, such as Tian’er, Shangguan Xue’er, Fei’er, Bing’er, coupled with Six Ultimate Heavenly Long Shiya and Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue. \n They were able to notice immediately because their cultivation base was high and they possessed Saint Energy.\n Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Celestial Territory had a strong repulsion and effects on people without Saint Energy. However, it will enhance the bodies of cultivators with Saint Energy, as long as Zhou Weiqing did not intentionally exclude them.\n Shangguan Xue’er was the closest. In order to protect Zhou Weiqing, she had already equipped herself with the Boundless Infinitum Set. Sensing the powerful threat of the black light rays, her figure flashed without hesitation, and appeared on the path that the black rays took. She merged her body with the sword. In mid-air, a vast misty white light descended from the sky.\n There was a reason why the Boundless Infinitum Set was considered the number one Legendary Set in the world. Even though Shangguan Xue’er only had eight pieces, it was sufficient to allow her to have the most powerful offense amongst the women. Moreover, overwhelming Saint Energy was still concentrated in her sword. This Boundless Core Nucleus was something that Shangguan Xue’er had achieved.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-285-3","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
