He vaguely remembered that something unusual had happened to his body due to the enormous pressure the Sea Terror Dragon had brought. It had resulted in some sort of unique technique being born which had then unleashed an attack alongside the ‘Like Dragon Equivalent Tiger’ transformation. As for what happened after that? He had no clue.\\n\\n He summoned his Personal Jewels, and upon doing so he immediately noticed something strange.\\n\\n Originally, Zhou Weiqing had fully stocked his first four Elemental Jewels with Stored Skills within them. Later on, the Six Ultimate Emperor Long Shiya had told him not to casually store Skills unless they were particularly exceptional, because he had too many Attributes. Once his Skills became too many for him to fully take in, it would actually have a negative impact on his cultivation.\\n\\n Since then, Zhou Weiqing had only Stored a single Skill. It was the \u0027Nether State\u0027 Skill that Tian’er’s mother, Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia had gifted him, and it had been stored in his fifth Elemental Jewel.\\n\\n Right now, however, Zhou Weiqing realized that his sixth Elemental Jewel had changed. It was actually no longer an Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel. Instead, it had turned into a pale gray gem.\\n\\n When he poured his Saint Energy into it, he made an even more shocking discovery. He found to his amazement that his sixth Elemental Jewel now completely rejected his other five Attributes. It could only hold the pure Demonic Attribute… and it already had a Skill Stored within it.\\n\\n This wasn’t the first Demonic Skill Zhou Weiqing had inherited from his bloodline powers. His Ward of the Demon God was a Demonic Skill, and it didn’t even take up any space in his Elemental Jewels; it was a unique thing of its own. He did also have other Skills which took up space, such as the mighty Devour Skill or the Fusion Skill Dark Demon God Lightning.\\n\\n This new Skill was now his fourth Demonic Skill, but Zhou Weiqing was absolutely certain that this would definitely become his strongest Skill of all. He could vaguely sense that this was a Skill which had come via something within his Bloodline being activated, something which belonged to the Dark Demon God Tiger. The name of this Skill was: Possession of the Demon God.\\n\\n Actually, Zhou Weiqing’s guess wasn’t 100% correct. Yes, the \u0027Possession of the Demon God\u0027 was a Skill that was related to the Dark Demon God Tiger, but it completely surpassed it.\\n\\n The Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline which Zhou Weiqing had inherited contained a strand of the Demon God Bloodline. This was why he had a connection to the Demon God and was able to summon its image… but, please do not forget that the Dark Demon God Tiger didn’t have a supreme Attribute like Saint Energy!\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing had on multiple occasions used his Saint Energy to activate his Demon God Bloodline. When he had battled against the Terror Sea Dragon and was in mortal danger, his Demon God Bloodline, in an attempt to protect itself, had actually transformed and upgraded.\\n\\n In other words, the Demon God power within Zhou Weiqing’s Bloodline was now vastly superior to that of the Dark Demon God Tiger. It had reached a brand new level, which was why this new ‘Possession of the Demon God’ technique had appeared. This was a Skill which didn’t belong to the Dark Demon God Tiger.\\n\\n It was all thanks to this Skill’s power that he had managed to injure the Heavenly God-level Terror Sea Dragon.\\n\\n Is this for real? Zhou Weiqing chortled to himself in a silly manner. In fact, he was grinning so hard he couldn’t keep his mouth closed. He had trained for so very long and had encountered many marvels, but this was the first time he encountered something wonderful like this.\\n\\n Although he wasn’t sure as to just how powerful the Possession of the Demon God was, the very fact that he was still alive and had seemingly managed to injure the Terror Sea Dragon was proof of how terrifying the Skill was. Even though using it had resulted in this absolutely miserable headache, it was all worth it! This was now an absolute killer trump card of his.\\n\\n The door swung opened and a maiden walked in. She looked to be seventeen or eighteen years of age and had a plain face, with a few blotches on her nose. When she came in, she saw Zhou Weiqing lying there while grinning like an idiot. She was badly startled. “Eek! Has he become retarded? What should we do?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s smile instantly froze. His face twitched, not sure whether to laugh or cry. “What do you mean, retarded? I’m perfectly fine.” While speaking, he massaged his temples. Although the Possession of the Demon God was quite powerful, its side effects were just as noticeable. He wouldn’t be able to recover just yet.\\n\\n The maiden patted her chest in relief, then smiled. “You scared me. I thought you turned retarded. If you did, I don’t know how I would’ve been able to explain things to that beautiful big sister.”\\n\\n When he heard the maiden’s guileless words, Zhou Weiqing asked, rather puzzled, “Where am I? A beautiful lady sent me here?”\\n\\n The maiden nodded. “This is Jimu Village, a small fishing village. You’ve been sleeping for two days. That beautiful big sister gave me money and said to let you rest here. She’d come back as soon as possible.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing subconsciously reached out towards his own chest. The necklace with the Spatial Teleportation Gem was still there. Then… why did Dongfang Hanyue leave him here and then depart? Did she have something important to take care of?\\n\\n “Are you hungry? I can give you some food,” the maiden said to Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing nodded. “Great! I’ll have to trouble you to do just that.”\\n\\n The maiden smiled bashfully, then turned and left.\\n\\n After sitting for a while, Zhou Weiqing noticed that his headache had seemingly improved quite a bit. He couldn’t help but sigh. Perhaps it was for the best that Dongfang Hanyue had left. He really didn’t know how to face her. He had taken away her palace’s most important treasure, but she didn’t retrieve it from him. Perhaps she had left to avoid any awkwardness between them. He had completed the mission. It was time to go back and resolve the problems facing the Luster Spatial Realm. This would save Heaven’s Expanse Palace quite a bit of labor; they’d no longer have to worry about how to evacuate Zhongtian City.\\n\\n While considering this question, he plucked out a silver-white jewel from within his Sumeru Ring. This was a ‘ten thousand kilometer voice transmission stone’. Although it couldn’t actually send messages from ten thousand kilometers away, a few thousand kilometers was still possible. Zhou Weiqing had taken it from Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Both he and Bing’er each had a piece, for fear that they might lose contact with each other in the Xuantian Continent.\\n\\n He infused his gentle Saint Energy into the voice transmission stone, causing it to instantly light up. A dense Spatial Attribute energy ripple flew out, causing Zhou Weiqing’s right hand to become rather blurry. Faint silver-white light scattered everywhere, causing that strange Spatial energy to instantly cover Zhou Weiqing’s body. The voice transmission had begun.\\n\\n “Bing’er. Bing’er,” Zhou Weiqing called softly. They had tested this thing out long ago. It was quite effective and very convenient. But… when he called out, there was actually no response at all. Zhou Weiqing’s heart sank. He called out once again, but there was still no response.\\n\\n By now, that maiden from the village had returned with food. When she saw how Zhou Weiqing’s entire body was glowing with silvery-white light, she was so shocked she couldn’t help but gape with her mouth open.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing waved at her, gesturing for her to leave. Being unable to reach Shangguan Bing’er had put him in a state of unease. He was in no mood to explain, much less eat.\\n\\n He left the bed and stood up on the ground. He tried several more times to contact Shangguan Bing’er, but his calls disappeared like a rock plummeting into the sea. There was no response whatsoever.\\n\\n What is going on? Why isn’t Bing’er responding? He had admonished her long ago that if they were ever separated, she had to keep her voice transmission stone by her side at all times! That way, he could contact her and bring her back at any time.\\n\\n Something’s wrong. Something has to be wrong. As the saying goes, when you cared about someone you would panic if anything happened to them. Zhou Weiqing was no longer able to remain calm, and he began to turn restless and uneasy.\\n\\n The two of them had come to the Xuantian Continent with a specific goal in mind. Shanguan Bing’er was back in the Xuantian Palace headquarters. If anything happened, it had to be something major.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing began to frantically pace back and forth within his room. He couldn’t be sure as to what had happened. Had Dongfang Hanyue regretted her choice and was unwilling to let him leave with the Spatial Teleportation Gem? Or did something else happen?\\n\\n No. Impossible. Although they had only known each other for a fairly brief period of time, Zhou Weiqing was still able to tell what type of a person Dongfang Hanyue was. She was very intelligent, but she wasn’t very rational. In fact, she was a very emotional person… and she really did like him.\\n\\n When he thought of this, another possible flickered through his mind. Could it be… that Dongfang Hanyue was afraid of losing him and also afraid that he would refuse her request to stay behind, and so she had imprisoned Bing’er and was there waiting for him to go back and find her?\\n\\n Yes. This was entirely possible. A bitter smile appeared on Zhou Weiqing’s face as he felt a sense of powerlessness. He slapped himself, hard. “Oh, Zhou Little Fatty. This is your fault. You sow the seeds of love wherever you go. Now, even Bing’er is in trouble because of it. I can’t stay here, I need to go to Xuantian Palace immediately. As the saying goes, ‘rivals in love can be deadly foes’. What if Hanyue can’t resist taking action against Bing’er? That’ll be troublesome.”\\n\\n When he thought about Shangguan Bing’er possibly being injured, Zhou Weiqing began to panic even more. However, he was still a person who had experienced many things. He knew that given his current state, even if he returned he wouldn’t necessarily achieve his goals. He had to at least recover and reach peak condition first.\\n\\n He walked over to the table, picked up the food the maiden had given him, and began to eat.\\n\\n The most common food in a fishing village was, naturally, fish. Although the fresh fish soup wasn’t exquisitely made, it was still extremely tasty. Mix in a few grains and vegetables and it made for a sumptuous meal. Alas, Zhou Weiqing didn’t have any appetite at all. Even the finest of foods tasted like ash in his mouth.\\n\\n He wolfed down the food, then immediately returned to the bed and sat down to meditate, entering the cultivation state.\\n\\n One of his Saint Energy’s finest properties was that he didn’t really need to worry about being disturbed. He could end his cultivation state whenever he wanted, and so he didn’t go out to tell that maiden not to disturb him. He needed to return to peak condition as soon as possible, then go rescue Bing’er.\\n\\n The Saint Energy in his body began to circulate. Zhou Weiqing wasn’t sure how he was supposed to replenish his mental energies, but he was certain of one thing – his Saint Energy could do anything.\\n\\n His belief was verified. As the thirty-six Death Acupuncture Points in his body had reached the thirty-eighth stage, his Saint Energy had only become even purer. As it circulated through his body, it constantly reduced the pain from the headache he was suffering.\\n\\n This was Zhou Weiqing’s first cultivation session after reaching the thirty-eighth stage. He realized that the Saint Energy in his body had increased markedly. On the whole, it had become even purer than before.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-254-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
