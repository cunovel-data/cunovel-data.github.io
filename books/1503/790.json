{"id":51964,"no":790,"title":"Chapter 268: A ‘betting’ fight with the Blood Red Hell (3)","content":"This time, they had chased all the way to the Heavenly Bow Empire for the exact reason that Zhou Weiqing had guessed - to totally resolve the problems in the west. Not only was their target the remainder of the Heavenly Demon Sect, but also the upper echelons of the entire Heavenly Bow Empire. No matter how powerful an army was, without an outstanding commander, they would not be able to flourish their full strength. Furthermore, without the top end offensive strength, any powerhouses taking action could easily destroy the several hundred thousand strong army of the Heavenly Bow Empire, or at least cause them to stall in their tracks. \n The youth walking in between the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue and the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was naturally Zhou Weiqing. Currently, his face was wearing a faint smile, as if he was here on a holiday. The trio walked all the way to barely thirty metres from the Blood Red Hell powerhouses before stopping. \n The Fourth Grand Elder of the Blood Red Hell said coldly: “Wu Yunyue, does your Heavenly Demon Sect only have these few people left? In that case, this old fellow will give you a last chance. As long as you are willing to bring your remaining Heavenly Demon Sect members to surrender and join our Blood Red Hell, I will let bygones be bygones and forgive you for your past transgressions.” \n When Wu Yunyue saw the Blood Red Hell powerhouses, his eyes turned red. However, he was after all a Heavenly Emperor, the Demonic Emperor, and he held back the rage in his heart. In a cold voice, he said: “Old Four, stop dreaming. Who knows which of us will end up victorious today. Since you have arranged this final battle now, let us get on with it.” \n The Fourth Grand Elder laughed heartily and said: “With just you mere few, you think you have the qualifications to fight against us? A bunch of ants.” \n At this point, Zhou Weiqing spoke. Taking two steps forward, he surpassed his own lines as he spoke with a smile: “This Junior Zhou Weiqing greets Seniors. Since the letter of challenge was written by you all, then you should give us an accounting right? To be honest, this Junior is a person who is really afraid of death, and I do not wish to die at all. How about we make a bet? If you all win, we will all surrender to the Blood Red Hell, lest we lose our lives.” \n When the Third Grand Elder of the Blood Red Hell heard those words, especially seeing that fawning smile on Zhou Weiqing’s face, he couldn’t help but laugh heartily. “So, you are that Zhou Weiqing? So, you are just a mere cowardly junior. Our Blood Red Hell will not easily accept any trash.” \n The smile on Zhou Weiqing’s face did not diminish as he continued: “Senior, those words aren’t too accurate. Although this Junior isn’t some great talent, at least I have reached the Heavenly King stage at the age of twenty over, so I believe I still have some potential left. Furthermore, when I said surrender, I did not just mean just the few of us, but the entire Heavenly Bow Empire. As you all know, the Heavenly Bow Empire’s revival was totally led by me, and thus I am still able to make such a decision. The only thing is… would Seniors dare to take this bet?” \n The Third Grand Elder was about to speak once more but the First Grand Elder held up his hand to stop him. Passively, he looked at Zhou Weiqing and asked: “How do you want to make this bet?” \n Zhou Weiqing grinned as he said: “Heh, since you all have arranged this battle, naturally the bet will be regarding our power. You have more people than us, so how about this, we’ll just fight a few rounds. I believe all of you should know the Heavenly Jewel Tournament right? Why don’t we have a fight using the rules of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament to decide the final victor? My apologies, I have joined the Heavenly Jewel Tournament twice, and both times I defeated the Dan Dun Empire to enter the top four, finally gaining the championship. As such, I am still most familiar with this style of fighting.” \n Fighting according to the Heavenly Jewel Tournament rules? Wasn’t that four single combat fights and a two versus two fight? \n These Blood Red Hell powerhouses had naturally once been young talents, and many of them had indeed joined the Heavenly Jewel Tournament in their time. As such, they were all familiar with the tournament rules. \n This suggestion of Zhou Weiqing’s drew the interest of quite a number of them. After all, no matter how one looked at it, the few numbers that Zhou Weiqing had could not possibly threaten the Blood Red Hell. Furthermore, from the way Zhou Weiqing was acting, it seemed like it was just an excuse to surrender without losing too much face. \n The First Grand Elder said passively: “What if we do not agree? With just the mere few of you, you do not have the qualification to name conditions.”\n Zhou Weiqing spread his hands in a helpless fashion as he said: “Well, if you do not agree, then we can only leave without making a deal. Although our powers may not be a match for all you Seniors, but if we really wish to run, I don’t know how many of us can Seniors actually catch.” \n A light flashed in the First Grand Elder’s eyes. “Does that mean to say that if I agree to this bet of yours, you all will not run?”\n Zhou Weiqing nodded, saying: “Of course, if you win, we will be surrendering. Once we surrender, I trust that the Blood Red Hell will treat us well, so why should we run?” \n The First Grand Elder’s eyes swept across the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and the Demonic Emperor. “A Junior like you can make the decision here?” \n The Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue forcefully restrained the anger and venom in his heart. Nodding strongly, he said: “That is the result of our discussion.” \n The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya did not even bother speaking, just nodding. \n The First Grand Elder smiled and said: “Very well, in that case I shall agree to your bet. In that case, you can send your first fighter now.” \n “Wait a second.” Zhou Weiqing continued: “This Junior has another suggestion.” \n The hot tempered Third Grand Elder said angrily: “You little brat, why do you have to speak so much rubbish.” \n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily: “This Junior is merely giving some personal suggestions, whether or not it is implemented will depend on the Seniors here. My meaning is, since this is a bet that will determine our fate, then we should not restrict the number of appearances for the contestants. In short, we do not restrict everyone to only fighting once in the fights. Also, since your side has more people, a five match total would be unfair to your Blood Red Hell side, and this Junior would not want to take this advantage. How about going for a seven-match series instead? Two of them can be two versus two matches, while the rest still single combat. The side with more victories would be the final victor. \n The Blood Red Hell First Grand Elder stated momentarily. Previously, he was highly guarded against the smiling youth. He just had the feeling that this youth was setting a trap for them to jump into. Even so, with the sheer power at their disposal, he did not care about any trap, and thus had just agreed to the bet, planning to seize this opportunity to resolve all problems in one go, so they could return to the Blood Red Hell as quickly as possible to deal with other issues. \n However, this current suggestion from Zhou Weiqing had caused him to change his mind. That was because it seemed like this proposal was just too beneficial for the Blood Red Hell side. After all, they had four Heavenly Emperors, while Zhou Weiqing’s side only had two. The more times they could join the fights, the better it was for them naturally. Although the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was extremely powerful, these four Grand Elders of the Blood Red Hell were also not ordinary Heavenly Emperors. Not only did all four of them have the Destruction Attribute, the First Grand Elder was even at the Max Level Heavenly Emperor stage, and he did not think he would lose to Long Shiya. \n Furthermore, in a clash of Heavenly Emperors, it was nearly impossible to hold back at all. In such a circumstance, even if one defeated their opponent, it should be nearly impossible for him to fight against another foe, at least for some time. \n As such, this First Grand Elder began to feel that Zhou Weiqing was truly just giving himself a reason to surrender, giving them all a logical reason to join the Blood Red Hell. \n If they could really take in and incorporate the Heavenly Bow Empire, that would definitely be great news for the entire Dan Dun Empire, and they could then focus all their efforts on the main battlefield. \n “Very well, as you wish.” The First Grand Elder did not hesitate to agree to Zhou Weiqing’s request. \n “Send your first fighter then.” \n Although the First Grand Elder had relaxed his guard, he was still a wily old fox, and he would not make the mistake of underestimating the opposing side. As such, he still insisted on Zhou Weiqing’s side dispatching their fighter first, so they could respond strategically. \n Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter look on his face as he complained: “Senior, that isn’t too good right? If it is always our side sending out our fighters first, then we definitely won’t have a chance at all. How about this, for the first round we will send out our fighter first, and the next round will be your side’s turn, and so on so forth. How about that?” \n The four Blood Red Hell Grand Elders were getting a little irritated. This Zhou Weiqing was constantly asking for so many requests, yet he was still smiling and polite. Although both sides were enemies, with their status, they would not fuss over such minor details. \n The First Grand Elder nodded and said: “Very well. Begin.” \n Zhou Weiqing took another step forward and said: “In that case, I will be the first to fight. May I know which Senior will be giving me a lesson first?” \n The four Grand Elders started momentarily. Although they had already gained news that Zhou Weiqing had entered the Heavenly King stage, and he had also just admitted it earlier, they did not think too highly of his current power levels. No matter what, his age was still there, and even if he had entered the Heavenly King stage, he should not be able to fight against their older Heavenly Kings. \n The Heavenly Demon Sect might be considered the weakest of all the five Great Saint Lands, but in terms of personal combat abilities, their fighting strength was definitely high up there. In the eyes of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses, any of the Heavenly Demon Sect’s Heavenly Kings would be far superior to Zhou Weiqing, and they did not understand why this young Zhou Weiqing would be sent to fight first. \n The First Grand Elder waved his hand, saying: “Tianlei, you go.” \n From behind the four Grand Elders, a tall, slender old man who looked to be in his sixties walked out.\n This old man had a cold, sombre gaze, and his face was expressionless as he walked out from behind the four Grand Elders. After bowing to them, he walked towards Zhou Weiqing, facing up against him. \n The four Grand Elders naturally felt that facing such a young man like Zhou Weiqing, it would not do for them to personally take action. Even so, the First Grand Elder had sent one of their stronger powerhouses, famed even in the Blood Red Hell. This old man was at the High Level Heavenly King stage, and he still had a bright possibility of entering the Heavenly Emperor stage in the future. In doing so, he was considered to have already placed quite a high importance on Zhou Weiqing. \n With a faint flicker of light around him, Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly. Giving a respectful fist palm salute, he said: “Junior Zhou Weiqing here, Senior, please advice me well.” \n Tianlei swept him with a cold gaze as he said: “Enough rubbish. Fight.” As he said that, he actually placed his left hand behind his back. From the looks of things, he was actually using a single hand to face up against Zhou Weiqing! \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-268-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
