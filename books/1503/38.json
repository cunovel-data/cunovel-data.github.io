I’ll listen to you, I’ll Consolidate any Equipment you ask me to. Even if you let me Consolidate into a pig, I will not oppose you!” At the same time as he said that, he lifted both hands to his ears, and imitated the appearance of pig ears flapping.\\n\\n “PUFF*. You originally already are a pig, if not why are you called Little Fatty Zhou.” Shangguan Bing’er was provoked into laughter by his pitiful acting again, and once again shot a kick his way. This time, Zhou Weiqing stood still and received it, although his face was contorted in exaggerated pain, but he did not move at all, giving an appearance that he was willing to accept being hit to accept punishment to be forgiven.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er lifts her hand to wipe the tears from her face, giving him a quick glare. In her heart she was thinking, This damn Little Fatty Zhou is really my lifelong adversary? Why am I always unable to deal with him?\\n\\n “You will do as I say and Consolidate whichever Equipment I tell you to, that’s what you said. Also, same for your Elemental Jewel Stored Skills.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing quickly nodded his head repeatedly, he wasn’t afraid of Shangguan Bing’er hitting or scolding him, but was terrified of her crying. As the saying goes, Beating is Affection, Scolding is Love, this rascal very naturally regarded those actions by Shangguan Bing’er as intimate actions. However when he saw her crying, Zhou Weiqing was at a loss. Even though on the surface he always had a laughing, happy face; in truth, he had a very guilty conscience from the events of that day.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er saw that he was being honest, and her anger also diminished, “Hmph. Let’s head back. You pack your things up, we will be leaving the army camp tomorrow early in the morning.”\\n\\n “Leaving the army camp? What are we going to do?” Zhou Weiqing asked curiously.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er said: “You will know when the time comes. You must have the mental preparation, this time we will be leaving for at least two to three months. You will not need to participate in the recruit training.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing blinked, “Just you and me?”\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er stopped in her tracks, turning her head to glare angrily at him, “If you want to die you can continue speaking! If you dare to have any dirty thoughts, I will, I will...”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing immediately continued: “You will cry for me... I fear that the most...” As he spoke those words, he immediately activated his Alexandrite Cat’s Eye’s Wind Attribute and ran off at top speed.\\n\\n Looking at his flustered escape, Shangguan Bing’er was provoked into laughter again, even unexpectedly playing along, shouting out to Zhou Weiqing: “Here comes the Silent Tracking Arrow!”\\n\\n With a *PUTONG* sound, Zhou Weiqing fell down to the ground upon hearing that, directly falling right into the woods, looking so disconcerted and distressed that even Shangguan Bing’er had a scare. She did not know that earlier on this fellow had been attacked from behind by Difuya, and was especially sensitive now.\\n\\n Only after Zhou Weiqing had fell hard on the ground then had he realised what had happened, and as Shangguan Bing’er’s crafty yet beautiful laughter resounded out, a shrill, pitiful yell rang out in the Stars Forest, “Murdering of your husband...” Instantly, that delightful laughter stopped, followed by the increased volume of that pitiful yell of pain...\\n\\n The next day, dawn.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er had changed into a simple cotton shirt and skirt, shouldering her Purple Dawn Bow on her back as she left the army camp. Even the simple clothes were not able to cover her outstandingly moving beauty.\\n\\n Just as she reached the exit of the army camp, she saw Zhou Weiqing, who was still dressed in his military uniform, lounging nearby the front exit. He was also shouldering a longbow on his back, as well as two quiver of arrows – the standard longbowman attire, down to even the archer’s Wind Hat.\\n\\n Seeing Shangguan Bing’er come out, Zhou Weiqing immediately stood at attention, giving a very proper salute, and shouted loudly, “Good Morning, Battalion Commander.”\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er glared at him exasperatedly, “Didn’t I tell you yesterday to wear ordinary clothes?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing scratched his head sheepishly: “I do not have any ordinary clothes, I’m on left with this military uniform, I don’t even have a spare set for changing.” At the same time was saying, he shot a sly look at Shangguan Bing’er.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er bit her lower lip, once again suppressing the urge to punch him, saying coldly: “Let’s go then.” As she said that, she had already started moving. Zhou Weiqing hurriedly Released his Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewel, activating his Wind Attribute, and set off in pursuit. They two of them ran in tandem, and very soon they had left the vicinity of the military compound, heading in an eastward direction along the Stars Boulevard.\\n\\n Shangguan Bing’er did not speak with Zhou Weiqing on the way, knowing that this was the best way to cope with this rascal. Although she held some hatred against Little Fatty Zhou, but after making the Three-Point Covenant with him, she no longer wanted to kill him. She told herself unceasing that all of this was for the sake of the Empire.\\n\\n Indeed, Shangguan Bing’er’s method was extremely effective, Zhou Weiqing followed beside Shangguan Bing’er, trying unceasingly to tease and tempt her into speaking, but no matter what he said, Shangguan Bing’er just ignored him, causing him to be so anxious that he was touching his ears and scratching his cheeks. If he said anything sensitive or untactful, then Shangguan Bing’er would just pick up her speed, since she had the additional boost of her agility Physical Jewels, she could instantaneously distance herself from him, causing Zhou Weiqing to chase her till he was panting heavily.\\n\\n From dawn to noon, more than four hours, Shangguan Bing’er had barely said a sentence to Zhou Weiqing, and also had not stopped to rest. At this time, the sun was high above in the sky, and Zhou Weiqing was perspiring heavily. Of course, running for 4 hours was nothing big for him, but the problem was following Shangguan Bing’er’s speed. At this time, the Heavenly Energy in his body was at the limit, when it was used up, his speed would drop, and the four energy whirlpools at the four Death Acupuncture Points would absorb energy from the environment, and after some recharging, he could make use of the Wind Attribute to accelerate once more; he endlessly duplicated this process of depletion of Heavenly Energy and then re-accelerating.\\n\\n By now, Shangguan Bing’er was also very curious, all along she had reduced her speed to allow Zhou Weiqing to follow, after all he only had the Wind Elemental Attribute boost, and could not compare with her double boost of both Physical and Wind Elemental Jewels. However, she soon discovered that this fellow who had just awakened Heavenly Jewels, and whose Heavenly Energy should only be at the 4th Stage, seemed to have a resilience and stamina to his Heavenly Energy that way surpassed her judgement. This was especially so after the 2nd hour, when he started the strange movement of slowing and accelerating, causing her to be even more curious. The unique strength that the Immortal Deity Technique possessed in absorbing Heavenly Energy from the environment so easily was not something that other Heavenly Energy Cultivation Techniques possessed.\\n\\n “Let’s rest a while.” Shangguan Bing’er came to a halt. Even at the sheer speed that the both of them were moving, after walking a whole morning they were still in the Stars Forest. If they wanted to exit this large forest, it would still take them the evening to do so even when maintaining that same speed.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing plopped his ass down and leaned on one of the Stars Trees at the side of the road, panting for breath in deep gulps, sweat soaking his entire body. However, he also discovered the marvelous ability of his Heavenly Energy – when his Heavenly Energy was depleted, even when he did not focus his attentions in stimulating them, the four opened Death Acupuncture Point’s energy whirlpools would still spin at full strength to automatically absorb Heavenly Energy from the environment to recharge his body.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-2-chapter-10-03","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
