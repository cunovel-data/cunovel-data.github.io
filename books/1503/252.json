(1)\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing had pounced at Little Witch with a perverted look, but she dodged it swiftly by turning into mist.\\n\\n This time, Little Witch could no longer hold her mask, as her eyes blazed in a cold fury. “Zhou Weiqing, are you asking to die?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing did not chase her, instead lounging on the couch, his eyes cold and no longer ‘perverted’ as he said passively: “In the past, Ming Hua and Ming Wu both tried to kill me. I have never thought your Heavenly Demon Sect had any good feelings towards me, nor is the feeling mutual. If I am not wrong, the Kalise Empire is able to send a team because of the support of the Bai Da Empire… or should I say more accurately, your Heavenly Demon Sect is supporting the Bai Da Empire, which in turn is supporting the Kalise Empire? You should know my origin… once I saw you with the Kalise Empire, and the fact that you attacked my companions… there is no longer a need for us to speak.”\\n\\n Little Witch stood there, the smile which had been on her face disappeared as her expression also turned cold. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, she shook her head slowly, saying: “No, your guess is not totally right. Indeed, you are correct that we are supporting the Kalise Empire, but that has nothing to do with the Bai Da Empire. Even if we want to support the Bai Da Empire, they would not dare accept our support. As for supporting the Kalise Empire, it is solely for this Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and only that. We need to enter the Heavenly Jewel Island, but amongst the five Great Saint Lands, our Heavenly Demon Sect is heavily persecuted and suppressed, and our power is definitely the lowest amongst the five. Without sufficient Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, we face the risk of having our future Demonic Heavenly Jewel Masters wiped out totally.”\\n\\n “If you are willing to cooperate with us, I can promise you that after the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, we will not have anything else to do with the Kalise Empire.”\\n\\n Hearing Little Witch’s words, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but be surprised, as he heard the sincerity in her words, and saw it in her eyes as well.\\n\\n Little Witch glanced at Fat Cat, who had squirmed her way out of Zhou Weiqing’s bosom, and continued saying: “This time, the reason I am here has nothing to do with the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and I am here specially for you. As for that time when I attacked your friends, that was a misunderstanding. At that time, I only sensed that the presence of a Heavenly Beast from the Heavenly Snow Mountain breaking through, and I was just attempting to interrupt it. If I had known it was you and your team, I would not have taken action.”\\n\\n “I’m not afraid to tell you that our Heavenly Demon Sect truly needs a first generation Awakened Demonic Bloodline. It has been over a hundred years since we had a fresh infusion of bloodlines, and without a powerful Demonic Jewel Master, especially a first generation one, we will not be able to hold our own against the other Great Saints Lands.”\\n\\n “For the sake of our Sect, if you really want me, that isn’t a big problem. However, I am the Holy Girl of our Heavenly Demon Sect, and I must keep my chastity, as my husband will be the next Sect Leader of our Heavenly Demon Sect. If you are willing to join us, with your first generation bloodline, you have a huge chance of becoming our future leader. Alas, the Heavenly Snow Mountain have taken a liking to you, and we know that we do not have the power to rival them, so we know that it will be impossible to ask you to join us. I only hope that we do not become enemies. This time, I have come personally to look for you, to make use of our Sect Secret Manuals to get your friendship, and hopefully leave a seed of hope for us.”\\n\\n Looking at Little Witch’s sincere look, Zhou Weiqing furrowed his brow slightly before saying: “That’s not possible. Even if I ‘lend’ you all my seed, the child is mine. I will not leave my child without a father. I may like beauties, but I do not want to just become a stud horse.”\\n\\n Little Witch giggled and said: “What’s wrong with being a stud? Isn’t that what all you men dream of?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing suddenly asked: “You were all constantly saying that a first generation Demonic Jewel Master’s Demonic Attribute is able to match the three great saint attributes. Does that mean, as a first generation Demonic Jewel Master, even if I use the Demonic Attribute, the other four Great Saint Lands will not cause trouble with me?”\\n\\n Little Witch thought for a while before saying: “There’s no harm in me telling you, but that means you owe me a favour. In order to have the four Great Saint Lands accept any Heavenly Demonic jewel Master, it is not necessary to be a first generation; as long as you can control your Demonic Change. The purer the bloodline, the easier it is to control the Demonic Change, especially through our Sect’s secret manual.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing asked curiously: “How many people in the Heavenly Demon Sect can control the Demonic Change then?”\\n\\n Little Witch glared at him exasperatedly before saying: “That’s a secret of our sect, how could I possibly tell you like that? Unless you join our sect.”\\n\\n “Zhou Weiqing, no matter what, you cannot change the fact that you are a Demonic Jewel Master, and we Demonic Jewel Masters can only survive in this current day and age. Otherwise, you will just be considered a heathen, a person they hunt. If you are willing to join our Sect, I can make the decision that you do not have to go through any Sealing, and as long as you can successfully practice our Secret Manual and control your Demonic Change, I … I will marry you and you will become the heir to Sect Leader.”\\n\\n As she spoke up to that point, her beautiful face flushed deeply. “You should know, although our Heavenly Demon Sect is the weakest amongst the five Great Saint Lands, we are still a powerful Saint Land with thousands of years of heritage and resources. Becoming the Sect Leader, you will be leading one of the top powers in the entire world.”\\n\\n Seeing the flush on her face, Zhou Weiqing said in a serious tone: “Your suggestion is very tempting, and I would definitely love to have the power of a great Saint Land behind me. Alas, if it were any other Great Saint Land, I would have agreed, but I am afraid I cannot do so far the Heavenly Demon Sect. That is because, no matter what, you all cannot walk out and show yourselves under the sun.”\\n\\n “You…” Little Witch said angrily. “What do you want before you agree?!”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said helplessly: “I truly am not able to help. I already have a fiancee, and I will not let her down.”\\n\\n Little Witch said scoffingly: “Don’t give me that… Ming Hua already told me what a pervert you are. What’s the point of acting like a gentleman now?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “You are right, I am perverted, but I definitely will not want to become a mere stud horse. I can feel your sincerity, and I believe that no matter what condition I give, you will try your best to fulfil it. However, I truly am unable to agree to that. The only guarantee I can give you is that as long as you all do not help the Kalise Empire, we will not be enemies. As for being friends, we will have to see how things develop in the future.”\\n\\n Little Witch said angrily with a twist of her mouth: “As a Demonic Jewel Master, aren’t you even the slightest bit interested in our secret arts? After all, this is a Great Saint Attribute comparable to the other three Great Saint Attributes! If used well, our Demonic Attribute can even be more powerful in terms of offensive capabilities, when compared to the other three.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Of course I am interested, I would be a fool not to be. However, I know that there is a cost to everything, and there is no such thing as a free lunch. After considering everything, I have decided that it is better for me not to have the secret arts for now. If you have nothing else, please leave now, I have to prepare for my next match. Oh yes, I have to remind you, since you have sent people to represent the Kalise Empire, if we meet in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, I will not hold back at all.”\\n\\n Little Witch gave a humph and said: “Hold back? Don’t think too highly of yourself. You are just at the three-Jeweled cultivation level. One day, you will definitely come and look for me.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “I truly cannot wait for such a day to come.”\\n\\n Little Witch gave another angry humph before turning to leave.\\n\\n After Little Witch left, Zhou Weiqing sat there, deep in thought. Although her appearance today seemed like a simple recruitment visit, or perhaps just a peace offering of sorts to clear the air, in truth it had told Zhou Weiqing many things. The most important thing he had learnt was that the Heavenly Demon Sect was in dire straits.\\n\\n Just like what Little Witch had said, he was just a mere three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master. For the Heavenly Demon Sect to send their Holy Girl of their Sect to look for him, and to actually give so any promises, it showed how terrible of a position they were in, and how desperate they were. Although he knew his talent was extremely outstanding, it wasn’t so much for any of the other Great Saint Lands to lower themselves to look for him, let alone with so many benefits.\\n\\n As for the Demonic Attribute Secret Arts that Little Witch mentioned, although Zhou Weiqing truly wanted to learn that, but what Little Witch did not know was that his Demonic Attribute was unlike any other Demonic Jewel Master. He had not Awakened the attribute by himself, but it had been inherited from the black pearl! Zhou Weiqing was not entirely sure what the black pearl had given him, but at least he knew that his Demonic Attribute already had the Devour Skill, which had appeared on its own and not Stored by him. Furthermore, that day when Fat Cat had leveled up, his Demonic Attribute had evolved in some way. As such, his thirst for the Demonic Attribute Secret Arts was not that strong.\\n\\n After some simple thought, Zhou Weiqing calmed himself down, glancing at Fat Cat who was once more sprawled on the bed, eyes closed. He knew that with his current power levels, it was pointless to think too much about the intricacies about the five Great Saint Lands. It was much more important for him to improve himself now.\\n\\n Once again, Zhou Weiqing started on his skill tempering training, and a sharp green light started flashing in his room.\\n\\n During the previous skill tempering training of the Spatial Rend, Zhou Weiqing discovered that not only did it help him in understanding the profound mysteries of the skill and attribute, it also actually improved his cultivation speed by almost several fold!\\n\\n After all, he had reached the first stage of Heavenly Shen Energy not long ago, yet he could sense that he was already on the verge of breaking through. Such a cultivation speed was definitely nigh unthinkable, and yet another benefit of the Immortal Deity Technique was shown.\\n\\n Bing’er had left, and the pressure that Shangguan Tianyue had given him had caused him to ignore that fear he had about the pain when breaking through Death Acupuncture Points. As long as he reached the limits of his Heavenly Energy, he would break through without hesitation and start on the third section of the Immortal Deity Technique.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-9-chapter-79-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
