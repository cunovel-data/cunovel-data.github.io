(1)\\n\\n “Wait, Boss!” Kou Rui jumped up and leaped to the front, blocking Zhou Weiqing from leaving.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing looked at him, a bitter smile on his face: “Good bro, don’t make it so hard for me.”\\n\\n Kou Rui shook his head, his eyes glittering in a sharp look as he said: “Boss, I will not make things difficult for you. However, I said that I will follow you, and I trust in my vision. Since you are leaving the Academy, I will leave together with you. It was you who taught me how to stand up straight, you who gave me the chance to actually gain my Consolidating Equipment. No matter where you go, I will follow you, and trust in my choice. Without Boss, there is no point staying here and studying.”\\n\\n Looking at Kou Rou’s determined eyes, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but be in a daze. He had not expected that this young man, Kou Rui, who had not really spent that much time together with him had actually so much confidence and trust in him. Even knowing the reason why Zhou Weiqing was leaving, he was resolute in leaving together with him, and fighting together with him.\\n\\n “Ahhh, this is so vexing!!” Right at that moment, a sorrowful voice rang out, and the huge Ma Qun charged forth as well. I am so vexed, it is tough to be large and tall. Having to sit behind, and my movement is just too slow, even though I charged forward so quickly, I am still behind you again. Kou Rui, you rascal, you actually came first again. Boss, you can’t play favourites! I also want to follow you, this time I am resolute about this, no matter how much you beat me I will still follow you!”\\n\\n Ma Qun sidled up closer brazenly, shamelessly grabbing onto Zhou Weiqing’s sleeve, as if nothing would cause him to let go.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but feel as if he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “Since when have you so much confidence in me?”\\n\\n Ma Qun grinned and said: “Heh heh, of course, it is because of power. Boss, in terms of understanding what the Heavenly Jewel Tournament is, I am likely the one who knows the most amongst all our classmates. The Heavenly Jewel Tournament top four has always been taken by the four Great Saint Lands, yet you managed to wrest victory from their grasp, and more so become the champion. They are also saying that you are not just a mere substitute, but the key to victory. What this means, how can I not know… Furthermore, you are also a Consolidating Equipment Master. I can’t go wrong following you right?”\\n\\n Pausing, Ma Qun spotted Zhou Weiqing’s look of disbelief. Finally, he scratched his head sheepishly and said with a bitter smile: “Alright alright, I’ll tell the truth. This year, I have failed all of the theory classes and exams thus far… If I continue like this, I am going to be expelled from school, and I might as well follow Boss.” This fellow had joined the Academy because of his Heavenly Jewel Master status, but his knowledge and theory was even worse than Zhou Weiqing’s.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing shook his head helplessly, and just as he was about to say something, Yan Zhexi walked forward once more, pushing the gold coin storage card he had been handed in front of Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n “Boss, we cannot take your money. At this moment, your homeland has been invaded, occupied, and this is a critical moment. You will have just too much expenditure for so many different things, and you definitely need it more than us. I will not accept your money, and I believe that everyone of us here will not accept it as well. You have already given us more than enough help. It can be said that, in the path of life, you are our most important teacher, and you are also the first person that I have truly respected. However, I will not follow you. I will continue staying in the Academy, to continue studying and learning all that I can. When I graduate, no matter what the others decide, no matter where you are, I will come to look for you. This is a promise of a man.”\\n\\n In the Commoner Class One, it was without doubt that Yan Zhexi was the top student, and with the best results in almost every class; definitely a student that excelled in both character and studies. Besides his cultivation level and power which was far below Zhou Weiqing’s, in terms of military knowledge, he was far beyond Zhou Weiqing.\\n\\n Their eyes met, and Zhou Weiqing could see the sincerity and resolution in Yan Zhexi’s eyes, something within that was almost indescribable. Spreading his arms, he gave Yan Zhexi a warm embrace and said: “Good bro, I understand. This money, please take it, I have enough from the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. As commoner students, the thing you lack most is money, and I trust that you will use it to its best value.”\\n\\n Yan Zhexi looked at Zhou Weiqing deeply before finally nodding in agreement. “Just Three and a half years.”\\n\\n “Boss! We also want to follow you!” Very soon, student after student started standing up, exclaiming excitedly.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing raised both hands and said: “Everyone sit down, listen to me please.”\\n\\n “I am really touched by all of you, and I am glad that my efforts have not been ignored. I truly believe that our Commoner Class One is a true team, united as one. Of course, I do wish to always be together with each and everyone of you, but not now. Zhexi is right, what you all need now is to study, to learn what you can in an age where you can best absorb it. Besides Ma Qun, I will not bring any of you along. There are three and a half years before graduation, and this will be our time of promise and agreement. I want you all to have the time to think things through and not jump into danger. In this three and a half years, all of you must work hard, to enrich yourselves and to learn all you can, and of course cultivate as hard as you can. At the same time, I will also strive hard, and you all will hear of my deeds in some other part of the world. If, on the day of your graduation, you still decide to follow me, then I will sincerely wait for your arrival.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing knew it was useless to just speak empty words. Although the Commoner Class One students respected him, and perhaps even idolize him, but not to the point of worshipping him. He did not want them to blindly follow him and regret it, but at the same time, if he wanted them to follow him after three and a half years, then he would have to gain enough power and strength by then. Three and a half years, it was the time he would give to them, but more so, a time limit for himself. These classmates of his were currently very limited in both power and knowledge, and it would be best for them to continue studying and training in this Fei Li Military Academy, but at the same time he too had a long road ahead to grow.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing’s gaze fell upon Kou Rui and he said: “My post of official reconnoitre leader will always be open for you. However, now is not the time for you to follow me.”\\n\\n A struggle showed in Kou Rui’s eyes, but as he looked at the resolute look in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, he knew that this boss of his had already made his decision.\\n\\n “Okay, I will remain.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly before turning to Ming Hua, saying: “Teacher Ming Hua, I leave them in your capable hands. I’ll take my leave now. Farewell.”\\n\\n As he said that, he finally stepped out of the Commoner Class One, and perhaps forever leaving the Fei Li Military Academy.\\n\\n Dou Dou and Ma Qun followed behind him, followed quickly by Yun Li. Since Zhou Weiqing was leaving for good, there was no reason for him to stay behind any longer.\\n\\n As the three left the main building, Zang Lang rushed out from behind. “Zhou Weiqing, have you forgotten our agreement?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing stopped in his tracks, saying with a hint of surprise: “You know my current situation… you are still willing to follow me?”\\n\\n Zang Lang nodded and said: “I am willing to follow you, I trust in you.”\\n\\n When Zhou Weiqing had arrived at the Academy, he had only used barely a month to unite the entire Commoner Class One, to make them a true whole unit. The other commoner students had witnessed all of it for themselves.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly before saying: “How many are there with the same feelings as you?”\\n\\n Zang Lang said: “Including myself, there are sixteen of us. We are all willing to follow you.”\\n\\n “So many? My future days will not be easy at all, you should know that.” Zhou Weiqing looked at him simply.\\n\\n A fire lit in Zang Lang’s eyes and he said: “Towards those classmates who may not even join you in the future, you are able to treat them so well. What do we have to worry about?! I am willing to be your Lifetime Follower. After all, following you is much better than following those noble fellows. I have always wished to have an exciting, fulfilling life, not lead a mediocre existence. We are Jewel Masters, trained for war, and we want to best use our abilities, not hide away from danger.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Very good. You know where my house is right? Bring them to look for me. I will only be waiting for one night. Tomorrow morning, I will be leaving the Fei Li City.\\n\\n Zang Lang nodded before he turned to leave.\\n\\n Yun Li looked at Zang Lang’s retreating figure before saying: “They have not had a good time at all. Your Commoner Class One has been assertive enough, and the nobles have left them alone. However, the price of that was that the other commoner students have suffered doubly in place. Perhaps that is the reason why they are so resolute in following you.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said: “No matter what their reason for joining me is, at least they will be a good boost to our strength, and that is something I sorely lack now. Yun Li, you have already reached the Grandmaster stage?”\\n\\n Yun Li said proudly: “Of course. In the future, please call me Grandmaster Yun Li.”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Very good, Grandmaster Yun Li! You stay at the Academy for now, you remember Lin TianAo right? Later on, he will be bringing a few people to look for me, and when they arrive, you just bring them to our house.”\\n\\n Yun Li said: “What is your plan after what happened to the Heavenly Bow Empire? Are we heading back there?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “No, I will not return just yet, it is not the right time for that just yet. This time, there should be many people who have an eye on me after I returned to the Fei Li City, so we need to leave as soon as possible and disappear without a trace. The Kalise Empire and Bai Da Empire have both entered the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, so they are very clear about my existence. The news of my return should reach them soon, and they will definitely not want to let me continue living.”\\n\\n Yun Li nodded and said: “Be careful.”\\n\\n …\\n\\n The house they had rented when they first came to the Fei Li City was still unchanged, and when Zhou Weiqing returned there, he stopped for a moment. His eyes fixed upon Shangguan Bing’er’s room.\\n\\n It had just been a few short months, but so many things had happened. Bing’er had left, Tian’er had also left, and even his home, the Heavenly Bow Empire had been conquered. All of this had indeed forced Zhou Weiqing to grow up quickly.\\n\\n Ma Qun looked around curiously, saying tentatively: “Boss, I remember you said that you will introduce a teacher to me? When?! Where are we heading next?”\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing said: “You will meet the teacher I mentioned soon, you better learn well from him, and if you do so, I guarantee that you will become a powerful defensive Heavenly Jewel Master. As for where we are going, I will keep that a secret for now, you just need to follow me. Dou Dou, you go rest in the room for now. Ma Qun, come with me.”\\n\\n “En.” Dou Dou made a sound of agreement, before entering Shangguan Bing’er’s original room. After all, Xing Tianyi had told her to listen to Zhou Weiqing before they left the Heavenly Jewel Island.\\n\\n Zhou Weiqing brought Ma Qun to his room and said: “You rest here for a while, make preparations as we should be leaving tonight. Perhaps, we will not be able to wait until tomorrow.”\\n\\n Ma Qun looked at Zhou Weiqing. He did not know why, but he suddenly felt a sense of pressure in his heart. Just a few months back, even though there had been a huge gap between him and Zhou Weiqing, but at that time, he did not have such a feeling.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-13-chapter-112-01","bookId":1503,"book":{"id":1503,"title":"Heavenly Jewel Change","description":"[Zen’s Synopsis]\\n In a world where power means everything, and the strong trample the weak; there was a boy born from a Heavenly Jewel Master.
