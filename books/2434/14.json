{"id":78590,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Slow steps. Mud under boots. Look nowhere else. Strange mantras loop through my head. Old bearded mutterings from dark alleys. Where are you going, Perry? Foolish child. Brainless boy. Where? Every day the universe grows larger, darker, colder. I stop in front of a black door. A girl lives here in this metal house. Do I love her? Hard to say any more. But she is all that\u0027s left. The final red sun in an ever-expanding emptiness. I walk into the house and find her sitting on the staircase, arms crossed over her knees. She puts a finger to her lips. \u0027Dad,\u0027 she whispers to me. I glance up the staircase towards the general\u0027s bedroom. I hear his voice slurring in the dimness. \u0027This picture, Julie. The water park, remember the water park? Had to haul ten buckets up for just one slide. Twenty minutes of work for ten seconds of fun. Seemed worth it back then, didn\u0027t it? I liked watching your face when you flew out of the tube. You looked just like her, even back then.\u0027 Julie stands up quietly, moves towards the front door. \u0027You\u0027re all her, Julie. You aren\u0027t me, you\u0027re her. How could she do it?\u0027 I open the door and back out. Julie follows me, soft steps, no sound. \u0027How could she be so weak?\u0027 the man says in a voice like steel melting. \u0027How could she leave us here?\u0027 We walk in silence. The drizzling rain beads in our hair and we shake it out like dogs. We come to Colonel Rosso\u0027s house. Rosso\u0027s wife opens the door, looks at Julie\u0027s face, and hugs her. We walk inside into the warmth. I find Rosso in the living room, sipping coffee, peering through his glasses at a water-stained old book. While Julie and Mrs Rosso murmur in the kitchen, I sit down across from the colonel. \u0027Perry,\u0027 he says. \u0027Colonel.\u0027 \u0027How are you holding up?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m alive.\u0027 \u0027A good start. How are you settling into the home?\u0027 \u0027I despise it.\u0027 Rosso is quiet for a moment. \u0027What\u0027s on your mind?\u0027 I search for words. I seem to have forgotten most of them. Finally, quietly, I say, \u0027He lied to me.\u0027 \u0027How so?\u0027 \u0027He said we were fixing things, and if we didn\u0027t give up everything might turn out okay.\u0027 \u0027He believed that. I think I do, too.\u0027 \u0027But then he died.\u0027 My voice trembles and I fight to squeeze it tight. \u0027And it was senseless. No battle, no noble sacrifice, just a stupid work accident that could have happened to anyone anywhere, any time in history.\u0027 \u0027Perry . . .\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t understand it, sir. What\u0027s the point of trying to fix a world we\u0027re in so briefly? What\u0027s the meaning in all that work if it\u0027s just going to disappear? Without any warning? A fucking brick on the head?\u0027 Rosso says nothing. The low voices in the kitchen become audible in our silence, so they drop to whispers, trying to hide from the colonel what I\u0027m sure he already knows. Our little world is far too tired to care about the crimes of its leaders. \u0027I want to join Security,\u0027 I announce. My voice is solid now. My face is hard. Rosso lets out a slow breath and sets his book down. \u0027Why, Perry?\u0027 \u0027Because it\u0027s the only thing left worth doing.\u0027 \u0027I thought you wanted to write.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s pointless.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027We have bigger concerns now. General Grigio says these are the last days. I don\u0027t want to waste my last days scratching letters on paper.\u0027 \u0027Writing isn\u0027t letters on paper. It\u0027s communication. It\u0027s memory.\u0027 \u0027None of that matters any more. It\u0027s too late.\u0027 He studies me. He picks up the book again and holds the cover out. \u0027Do you know this story?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s Gilgamesh.\u0027 \u0027Yes. The Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest known works of literature. Humanity\u0027s debut novel, you could say.\u0027 Rosso flips through the brittle yellow pages. \u0027Love, sex, blood and tears. A journey to find eternal life. To escape death.\u0027 He reaches across the table and hands the book to me. \u0027It was written over four thousand years ago on clay tablets by people who tilled the mud and rarely lived past forty. It\u0027s survived countless wars, disasters and plagues, and continues to fascinate to this day, because here I am, in the midst of modern ruin, reading it.\u0027 I look at Rosso and don\u0027t look at the book. My fingers dig into the leather cover. \u0027The world that birthed that story is long gone, all its people are dead, but it continues to touch the present and future because someone cared enough about that world to keep it. To put it in words. To remember it.\u0027 I split the book open to the middle. The pages are riddled with ellipses, marking words and lines missing from the text, rotted out and lost to history. I stare at these marks and let their black dots fill my vision. \u0027I don\u0027t want to remember,\u0027 I say, and I shut the book. \u0027I want to join Security. I want to do dangerous stuff. I want to forget.\u0027 \u0027What are you saying, Perry?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not saying anything.\u0027 \u0027It sounds like you are.\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 The shadows in the room pool in the lines of our faces, draining our eyes of hue. \u0027There\u0027s nothing left worth saying.\u0027 I am numb. Adrift in the blackness of Perry\u0027s thoughts, I reverberate with his grief like a low church bell. \u0027Are you working, Perry?\u0027 I whisper into the emptiness. \u0027Are you reverse-engineering your life?\u0027 Shhhhhh, Perry says. Don\u0027t break the mood. I need this to cut through. I float there in his unshed tears, waiting in the salty dark. Morning sun streams through the balcony window of Julie\u0027s bedroom. The green constellations have faded back into the blue sky of the ceiling. The girls are still asleep, but I\u0027ve been lying here awake for all but a few uneasy hours. Unable to stay motionless any longer, I slip out of the blankets and stretch my creaky joints, letting the sun baste one side of my face then the other. Nora sleep-mumbles a bit of nursing jargon, \u0027mitosis\u0027 or \u0027meiosis\u0027, possibly \u0027necrosis\u0027, and I notice the dog-eared textbook resting open on her stomach. Curious, I hover over her for a moment, then carefully lift up the book. I can\u0027t read the title. But I immediately recognise the cover. A serenely sleeping face offering its throat of exposed veins to the viewer. The medical reference book, Gray\u0027s Anatomy. Looking nervously over my shoulder, I whisk the heavy tome out into the hallway and start flipping through its pages. Intricate drawings of human architecture, organs and bones all too familiar to me, although here the filleted bodies are shown clean and perfect, their details unblurred by filth or fluids. I pore over the illustrations as the minutes tick by, racked by guilt and fascination like a pubescent Catholic with a Playboy. I can\u0027t read the captions, of course, but a few Latin words pop into my head as I study the images, perhaps distant recalls from my old life, a college lecture or TV documentary I absorbed somewhere. The knowledge feels grotesque in my mind but I grasp it and hold it tight, etching it deep into my memory. Why am I doing this? Why do I want to know the names and functions of all the beautiful structures I\u0027ve spent my years violating? Because I don\u0027t deserve to keep them anonymous. I want the pain of knowing them and, by extension, myself: who and what I really am. Maybe with that scalpel, red hot and sterilised in tears, I can begin to carve out the rot inside me. Hours pass. When I\u0027ve seen every page and wrung every syllable from my memory, I gently replace the book on Nora\u0027s belly and tiptoe out onto the balcony, hoping the warm sun will grant some relief from the moral nausea churning inside me. I lean against the railing and take in the cramped vistas of Julie\u0027s city. As dark and lifeless as it was last night, now it bustles and roars like Times Square. What is everyone doing? The undead airport has its crowds but no real activity. We don\u0027t do things; we wait for things to happen. The collective volition bubbling up from the Living is intoxicating, and I have a sudden urge to be down in those masses, rubbing shoulders and elbowing for space in all that sweat and breath. If my questions have answers, they must certainly be down there, under the pounding soles of those filthy feet. I hear the girls chatting quietly in the bedroom, finally waking up. I go back inside and crawl under the blankets next to Julie. \u0027Good morning, R,\u0027 Nora says, not quite sincerely. I think speaking to me like a human is still a novelty for her; she looks like she wants to titter every time she acknowledges my presence. It\u0027s aggravating, but I understand. I\u0027m an absurdity that takes some getting used to. \u0027Morning,\u0027 Julie croaks, watching me from across the pillow. She looks about as un-pretty as I\u0027ve ever seen her, eyes puffy and hair insane. I wonder how well she sleeps at night, and what kind of dreams she has. I wish I could step into them like she steps into mine. She rolls onto her side and props her head on her elbow. She clears her throat. \u0027So,\u0027 she says. \u0027Here you are. What now?\u0027 \u0027Want to . . . see your city.\u0027 Her eyes search my face. \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027Want to . . . see how you live. Living people.\u0027 Her lips tighten. \u0027Too risky. Someone would notice you.\u0027 \u0027Come on, Julie,\u0027 Nora says. \u0027He walked all the way here, let\u0027s give him a tour! We can fix him up, disguise him. He already got past Ted, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be okay strolling around a little if we\u0027re careful. You\u0027ll be careful, right, R?\u0027 I nod, still looking at Julie. She allows a long silence. Then she rolls onto her back and closes her eyes, releasing a slow breath that sounds like consent. \u0027Yay!\u0027 Nora says. \u0027We can try it. But, R, if you don\u0027t look convincing after we fix you up, no tour. And if I see anyone staring at you too hard, tour\u0027s over. Deal?\u0027 I nod. \u0027No nodding. Say it.\u0027 \u0027Deal.\u0027 She crawls out of the blankets and climbs onto the side of the bed. She looks me up and down. \u0027Okay,\u0027 she says, her hair sticking out in every direction. \u0027Let\u0027s get you presentable.\u0027 I would like my life to be a movie so I could cut to a montage. A quick sequence of shots set to some trite pop song would be much easier to endure than the two gruelling hours the girls spend trying to convert me, to change me back into what\u0027s widely considered human. They wash and trim my hair. They wear out a fresh toothbrush on my teeth, although for my smile anything above a coffee-addicted Brit is not in the cards. They attempt to dress me in some of Julie\u0027s more boyish clothes, but Julie is a pixie and I rip through T-shirts and snap buttons like a bodybuilder. Finally they give up, and I wait naked in the bathroom while they run my old business-casual through the wash. While I wait, I decide to take a shower. This is an experience I had long forgotten, and I savour it like a first sip of wine, a first kiss. The steaming water cascades over my battered body, washing away months or years of dirt and blood, some of it mine, much of it others\u0027. All this filth spirals down the drain and into the underworld where it belongs. My true skin emerges, pale grey, marked by cuts and scrapes and grazing bullet wounds, but clean. This is the first time I have seen my body. When my clothes are dry and Julie has sewn up the most noticeable holes, I dress myself, relishing the unfamiliar feeling of cleanness. My shirt no longer sticks to me. My slacks no longer chafe. \u0027You should at least lose the tie,\u0027 Nora says. \u0027You\u0027re about ten wars behind the fashion curve in that fancy get-up.\u0027 \u0027No, leave it,\u0027 Julie pleads, regarding the little strip of cloth with a whimsical smile. \u0027I like that tie. It\u0027s the only thing keeping you from being completely grey.\u0027 \u0027It sure won\u0027t help him blend in, Jules. Remember all the stares we got when we started wearing sneakers instead of work boots?\u0027 \u0027Exactly. People already know you and me don\u0027t wear the uniform; as long as R stays with us he could wear spandex shorts and a top hat and no one would mention it.\u0027 Nora smiles. \u0027I like that idea.\u0027 So the tie remains, in all its red silk incongruity. Julie helps me knot it. She brushes my hair and runs some goo through it. Nora thoroughly fumigates me with men\u0027s body spray. \u0027Ugh, Nora,\u0027 Julie objects. \u0027I hate that stuff. And he doesn\u0027t even stink.\u0027 \u0027He stinks a little bit.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, now he does.\u0027 \u0027Better he smell like a chemical plant than a corpse, right? It\u0027ll keep the dogs away from him.\u0027 There is some debate about whether or not to make me wear sunglasses to hide my eyes, but they eventually decide this would be more conspicuous than just letting that ethereal grey show itself. \u0027It\u0027s actually not that noticeable,\u0027 Julie says. \u0027Just don\u0027t have a staring contest with anyone.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll be fine,\u0027 Nora adds. \u0027No one in this place really looks at each other anyway.\u0027 The final step in their remodelling plan is make-up. As I sit in front of the mirror like a Hollywood starlet getting ready for her close-up, they powder me, they rouge me, they colourise my black-and-white skin. When they\u0027re done, I stare at the mirror in amazement. I am alive. I am a handsome young professional, happy, successful, in the bloom of health, just emerging from a meeting and on my way to the gym. I laugh out loud. I look at myself in the mirror and the joyful absurdity of it just bubbles out. Laughter. Another first for me. \u0027Oh my . . .\u0027 Nora says, standing back to look at me, and Julie says, \u0027Huh.\u0027 She tilts her head. \u0027You look . . .\u0027 \u0027You look hot !\u0027 Nora blurts. \u0027Can I have him, Julie? Just for one night?\u0027 \u0027Shut your dirty mouth,\u0027 Julie chuckles, still inspecting me. She touches my forehead, the narrow, bloodless slot where she once threw a knife. \u0027Should probably cover that. Sorry, R.\u0027 She sticks a Band-Aid over the wound and presses it down with gentle strokes. \u0027There.\u0027 She steps back again and studies me like a perfectionist painter, pleased but cautious. \u0027Con . . . vincing?\u0027 I ask. \u0027Hmm,\u0027 she says. I offer her my best attempt at a winning smile, stretching my lips wide. \u0027Oh, God. Definitely don\u0027t do that.\u0027 \u0027Just be natural,\u0027 Nora says. \u0027Pretend you\u0027re home at the airport surrounded by friends, if you people have those.\u0027 I think back to the moment Julie named me, that warm feeling that crept into my face for the first time as we shared a beer and a plate of Thai food. \u0027There you go, that\u0027s better,\u0027 Nora says. Julie nods, pressing her knuckles against her smiling lips as if to hold back some outburst of emotion. A giddy cocktail of amusement, pride and affection. \u0027You clean up nice, R.\u0027 \u0027Thank . . . you.\u0027 She takes a deep, decisive breath. \u0027Okay then.\u0027 She pulls a wool beanie over her wild hair and zips up her sweatshirt. \u0027Ready to see what humanity\u0027s been up to since you left it?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-14.html","bookId":2434,"book":{"id":2434,"title":"Warm Bodies (Warm Bodies #1)","description":"Storyline: R is having a no-life crisis - he is a zombie.
