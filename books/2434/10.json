{"id":78586,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Ten minutes later, the storm has launched into its big opening movement, and we are getting soaked. The convertible was a poor choice for a day like this. Neither of us can figure out how to put the top up, so we drive in silence with heavy sheets of rain beating down on our heads. We don\u0027t complain, though. We try to stay positive. \u0027Do you know where you\u0027re going?\u0027 Julie asks after about twenty minutes. Her hair is matted flat on her face. \u0027Yes,\u0027 I say, looking down the road at the dark grey horizon. \u0027Are you sure? \u0027Cause I have no idea.\u0027 \u0027Very . . . sure.\u0027 I prefer not to explain why I know the route between the airport and the city so well. Our hunting route. Yes, she knows what I am and what I do, but do I have to remind her? Can we just have a nice drive and forget certain things for a while? In the sunny fields of my imagination we are not a teenager and a walking corpse driving in a rainstorm. We are Frank and Ava cruising tree-lined country lanes while a scratchy vinyl orchestra swoons our soundtrack. \u0027Maybe we should stop and ask directions.\u0027 I look at her. I look around at the crumbling districts surrounding us, nearly black in the evening gloom. \u0027Kidding,\u0027 she says, her eyes peeking out between plastered wet clumps of hair. She leans back in the seat and folds her arms behind her head. \u0027Let me know when you need a break. You kinda drive like an old lady.\u0027 As the rain pools into standing water at our feet, I notice Julie shivering a little. It\u0027s a warm spring night, but she\u0027s saturated, and the cab of the old convertible is a cyclone of freeway wind. I take the next exit, and we ease down into a silent graveyard of suburban grid homes. Julie looks at me with questioning eyes. I can hear her teeth chattering. I drive slowly past the houses, looking for a good place to stop for the night. Eventually I pull into a weedy cul-de-sac and park next to a rusted mini-van. I take Julie\u0027s hand and pull her towards the nearest house. The door is locked, but the dry-rotted wood gives way with a light kick. We step into the relative warmth of some long-dead family\u0027s cosy little nest. There are old Coleman lanterns placed throughout the house, and once Julie lights them they provide a flickering campsite glow that feels oddly comforting. She ambles around the kitchen and living room, looking at toys, dishes, stacks of old magazines. She picks up a stuffed koala bear and looks it in the eyes. \u0027Home sweet home,\u0027 she mumbles. She reaches into her messenger bag, pulls out a Polaroid camera, points it at me and snaps a shot. The flash is shocking in this dark place. She grins at my startled expression and holds up the camera. \u0027Look familiar? I stole it from the skeletons\u0027 meeting room yesterday morning.\u0027 She hands me the developing photo. \u0027It\u0027s important to preserve memories, you know? Especially now, since the world is on its way out.\u0027 She puts the viewfinder to her eye and turns in a slow circle, taking in the whole room. \u0027Everything you see, you might be seeing for the last time.\u0027 I wave the picture in my hand. A ghostly image begins to take shape. It\u0027s me, R, the corpse that thinks it\u0027s alive, staring back at me with those wide, pewter-grey eyes. Julie hands the camera to me. \u0027You should always be taking pictures, if not with a camera then with your mind. Memories you capture on purpose are always more vivid than the ones you pick up by accident.\u0027 She strikes a pose and grins. \u0027Cheese!\u0027 I take her picture. When it rolls out of the camera she reaches for it, but I pull it away and hide it behind my back. I hand her mine. She rolls her eyes. She takes the photo and studies it, tilting her head. \u0027Your complexion looks a little better. The rain must have cleaned you up a bit.\u0027 She lowers the photo and squints at me for a moment. \u0027Why are your eyes like that?\u0027 I look at her warily. \u0027Like . . . what?\u0027 \u0027That weird grey. It\u0027s nothing like how corpse eyes look. Not clouded over or anything. Why are they like that?\u0027 I give this some thought. \u0027Don\u0027t know. Happens at . . . conversion.\u0027 She\u0027s looking at me so hard I start to squirm. \u0027It\u0027s creepy,\u0027 she says. \u0027Looks . . . supernatural, almost. Do they ever change colour? Like when you kill people or something?\u0027 I try not to sigh. \u0027I think . . . you\u0027re thinking . . . of vampires.\u0027 \u0027Oh, right, right.\u0027 She chuckles and gives a rueful shake of her head. \u0027At least those aren\u0027t real yet. Too many monsters to keep track of these days.\u0027 Before I can take offence, she looks up at me and smiles. \u0027Anyway . . . I like them. Your eyes. They\u0027re actually kinda pretty. Creepy . . . but pretty.\u0027 It\u0027s probably the best compliment I\u0027ve received in my entire Dead life. Ignoring my idiot stare, Julie wanders off into the house, humming to herself. The storm is raging outside, with occasional thunderclaps. I\u0027m grateful that our house happens to have all its windows intact. Most of the others\u0027 were smashed long ago by looters or feeders. I glimpse a few debrained corpses on our neighbours\u0027 green lawns, but I\u0027d like to imagine our hosts got out alive. Made it to one of the Stadiums, maybe even some walled-off paradise in the mountains, angelic choirs singing behind pearl-studded titanium gates . . . I sit in the living room listening to the rain fall while Julie putters around the house. After a while she comes back with an armful of dry clothes and dumps them on the love seat. She holds up a pair of jeans about ten sizes too big. \u0027What do you think?\u0027 she says, wrapping the waist around her entire body. \u0027Do these make me look fat?\u0027 She drops them and digs around in the pile, pulls out a mass of cloth that appears to be a dress. \u0027I can use this for a tent if we get lost in the woods tomorrow. God, these folks must have made a fancy feast for some lucky zombie.\u0027 I shake my head, making a gag face. \u0027What, you don\u0027t eat fat people?\u0027 \u0027Fat . . . not alive. Waste product. Need . . . meat.\u0027 She laughs. \u0027Oh, so you\u0027re an audiophile and a food snob! Jesus.\u0027 She tosses the clothes aside and lets out a deep breath. \u0027Well, all right. I\u0027m exhausted. The bed in there isn\u0027t too rotten. I\u0027m going to sleep.\u0027 I lie back on the cramped love seat, settling in for a long night alone with my thoughts. But Julie doesn\u0027t leave. Standing there in the bedroom doorway, she looks at me for a long minute. I\u0027ve seen this look before, and I brace myself for whatever\u0027s coming. \u0027R . . .\u0027 she says. \u0027Do you . . . have to eat people?\u0027 I sigh inside, so exhausted by these ugly questions, but when did a monster ever deserve its privacy? \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Or you\u0027ll die?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027But you didn\u0027t eat me.\u0027 I hesitate. \u0027You rescued me. Like three times.\u0027 I nod slowly. \u0027And you haven\u0027t eaten anyone since then, right?\u0027 I frown in concentration, thinking back. She\u0027s right. Not counting the few bites of leftover brains here and there, I\u0027ve been gastronomically celibate since the day I met her. A peculiar little half-smile twitches on her face. \u0027You\u0027re kind of . . . changing, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 As usual, I am speechless. \u0027Well, goodnight,\u0027 she says, and shuts the bedroom door. I lie there on the love seat, gazing up at the water-stained cottage-cheese ceiling. \u0027What\u0027s going on with you?\u0027 M asks me over a cup of mouldy coffee in the airport Starbucks. \u0027Are you okay?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I\u0027m okay. Just changing.\u0027 \u0027How can you change? If we all start from the same blank slate, what makes you diverge?\u0027 \u0027Maybe we\u0027re not blank. Maybe the debris of our old lives still shapes us.\u0027 \u0027But we don\u0027t remember those lives. We can\u0027t read our diaries.\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter. We are where we are, however we got here. What matters is where we go next.\u0027 \u0027But can we choose that?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re Dead. Can we really choose anything?\u0027 \u0027Maybe. If we want to bad enough.\u0027 The rain drumming on the roof. The creak of weary timbers. The prickle of the old cushions through the holes in my shirt. I\u0027m busy searching my post-death memory for the last time I went this long without food when I notice Julie standing in the doorway again. Her arms are folded on her chest and her hip is pressed against the door frame. Her foot taps an anxious rhythm on the floor. \u0027What?\u0027 I ask. \u0027Well . . .\u0027 she says. \u0027I was just thinking. The bed\u0027s a king-size. So I guess, if you wanted to . . . I wouldn\u0027t care if you joined me in there.\u0027 I raise my eyebrows a little. Her face reddens. \u0027Look, all I\u0027m saying - all I\u0027m saying - is I don\u0027t mind giving you a side of the bed. These rooms are kinda spooky, you know? I don\u0027t want the ghost of Mrs Sprat crushing me in my sleep. And considering I haven\u0027t showered in over a week, you really don\u0027t smell much worse than I do - maybe we\u0027ll cancel each other out.\u0027 She shrugs one shoulder, whatever, and disappears into the bedroom. I wait a few minutes. Then, with great uncertainty, I get up and follow her in. She is already in the bed, curled into the foetal position with the blankets pulled tight around her. I slowly ease myself onto the far opposite edge. The blankets are all on her side, but I certainly don\u0027t need to stay warm. I am perpetually room-temperature. Despite the pile of luxurious down comforters wrapped around her, Julie is still shivering. \u0027These clothes are . . .\u0027 she mutters, and sits up in bed. \u0027Fuck.\u0027 She glances over at me. \u0027I\u0027m going to lay my clothes out to dry. Just . . . relax, okay?\u0027 With her back to me, she wriggles out of her wet jeans and peels her shirt over her head. The skin of her back is blue-white from the cold. Almost the same hue as mine. In her polka-dot bra and plaid panties, she gets out of bed and drapes her clothes over the dresser, then quickly crawls back under the covers and curls up. \u0027Goodnight,\u0027 she says. I lie back on my folded arms, staring up at the ceiling. We are both on the very edges of the mattress, about four feet of space between us. I get the feeling that it\u0027s not just my ghoulish nature that makes her so wary. Living or Dead, virile or impotent, I still appear to be a man, and maybe she thinks I\u0027ll act the same as any other man would, lying so close to a beautiful woman. Maybe she thinks I\u0027ll try to take things from her. That I\u0027ll slither over and try to consume her. But then why am I even in this bed? Is it a test? For me, or for her? What strange hopes are compelling her to take this chance? I listen to her breathing slow as she falls asleep. After a few hours, with her fear safely tucked away in dreams, she rolls over, removing most of the gap between us. She\u0027s facing me now. Her faint breath tickles my ear. If she were to wake up right now, would she scream? Could I ever make her understand how safe she really is? I won\u0027t deny that this proximity ignites more urges in me than the instinct to kill and eat. But although these new urges are there, some of them startling in their intensity, all I really want to do is lie next to her. In this moment, the most I\u0027d ever hope for would be for her to lay her head on my chest, let out a warm, contented breath, and sleep. Now here is an oddity. A question for the zombie philosophers. What does it mean that my past is a fog but my present is brilliant, bursting with sound and colour? Since I became Dead I\u0027ve recorded new memories with the fidelity of an old cassette deck, faint and muffled and ultimately forgettable. But I can recall every hour of the last few days in vivid detail, and the thought of losing a single one horrifies me. Where am I getting this focus? This clarity? I can trace a solid line from the moment I met Julie all the way to now, lying next to her in this sepulchral bedroom, and despite the millions of past moments I\u0027ve lost or tossed away like highway trash, I know with a lockjawed certainty I\u0027ll remember this one for the rest of my life. Sometime in the pre-dawn, as I lie there on my back with no real need to rest, a dream flickers on like a film reel behind my eyes. Except it\u0027s not a dream, it\u0027s a vision, far too crisp and bright for my lifeless brain to have rendered. Usually these second-hand memories are preceded by the taste of blood and neurons, but not tonight. Tonight I close my eyes and it just happens, a surprise midnight showing. We open on a dinner scene. A long metal table laid out with a minimalist spread. Bowl of rice. Bowl of beans. Rectangle of flax bread. \u0027Thank you, Lord, for this food,\u0027 says the man at the head of the table, hands folded in front of him but eyes wide open. \u0027Bless it to our bodies. Amen.\u0027 Julie nudges the boy sitting next to her. He squeezes her thigh under the table. The boy is Perry Kelvin. I\u0027m in Perry\u0027s mind again. His brain is gone, his life evaporated and inhaled . . . yet he\u0027s still here. Is this a chemical flashback? A trace of his brain still dissolving somewhere in my body? Or is it actually him? Still holding on somewhere, somehow, somewhy? \u0027So, Perry,\u0027 Julie\u0027s dad says to him - to me. \u0027Julie tells me you\u0027re working for Agriculture now.\u0027 I swallow my rice. \u0027Yes, sir, General Grigio, I\u0027m a - \u0027 \u0027This isn\u0027t the mess hall, Perry, this is dinner. Mr Grigio will be fine.\u0027 \u0027Okay. Yes, sir.\u0027 There are four chairs at the table. Julie\u0027s father sits at the head, and she and I sit next to each other on his right. The chair at the other end of the table is empty. What Julie tells me about her mother is this: \u0027She left when I was twelve.\u0027 And though I\u0027ve gently probed, she has never offered me more, not even while we\u0027re lying naked in my twin bed, exhausted and happy and as vulnerable as any two people can be. \u0027I\u0027m a planter right now,\u0027 I tell her father, \u0027but I think I\u0027m on track for a promotion. I\u0027m shooting for harvest supervisor.\u0027 \u0027I see,\u0027 he says, nodding thoughtfully. \u0027That isn\u0027t a bad job . . . but I wonder why you don\u0027t join your father in Construction. I\u0027m sure he could use more young men working on that all-important corridor.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s asked me to, but ah . . . I don\u0027t know, I just don\u0027t think Construction is the place for me right now. I like working with plants.\u0027 \u0027Plants,\u0027 he repeats. \u0027I just think in times like these there\u0027s something meaningful about growing things. The soil\u0027s so depleted it\u0027s hard to get much out of it, but it\u0027s pretty satisfying when you finally do see some green coming through that grey crust.\u0027 Mr Grigio stops chewing, blank-faced. Julie looks uneasy. \u0027Remember that little shrub we had in our living room back east?\u0027 she says. \u0027The one that looked like a skinny little tree?\u0027 \u0027Yes . . .\u0027 her dad says. \u0027What about it?\u0027 \u0027You loved that thing. Don\u0027t act like you don\u0027t get gardening.\u0027 \u0027That was your mother\u0027s plant.\u0027 \u0027But you\u0027re the one who loved it.\u0027 She turns to me. \u0027So Dad used to be quite the interior designer, believe it or not; he had our old house decked out like an IKEA showroom, all this modern glass and metal stuff, which my mom couldn\u0027t stand - she wanted everything earthy and natural, all hemp fibre and sustainable hardwoods . . .\u0027 Mr Grigio\u0027s face looks tight. Julie either doesn\u0027t notice or doesn\u0027t care. \u0027. . . so to fight back, she buys this lush, bright green shrub, puts it in a huge wicker pot, and sticks it right in the middle of Dad\u0027s perfect white-and-silver living room.\u0027 \u0027It wasn\u0027t my living room, Julie,\u0027 he interjects. \u0027As I recall we took a vote on every piece of furniture, and you always sided with me.\u0027 \u0027I was like eight, Dad, I probably liked pretending I lived in a spaceship. Anyway, Mom buys this plant and they argue about it for a week - Dad says it\u0027s \"incongruous\", Mom says either the plant stays or she goes - \u0027 She hesitates momentarily. Her father\u0027s face gets tighter. \u0027That, um, that went on for a while,\u0027 she resumes, \u0027but then Mom being Mom, she got obsessed with something else and quit watering the plant. So when it started dying, guess who adopted the poor thing?\u0027 \u0027I wasn\u0027t going to have a dead shrub as our living room\u0027s centrepiece. Someone had to take care of it.\u0027 \u0027You watered it every day, Dad. You gave it plant food and pruned it.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Julie, that\u0027s how you keep a plant alive.\u0027 \u0027Why can\u0027t you admit you loved the stupid plant, Dad?\u0027 She regards him with a mixture of amazement and frustration. \u0027I don\u0027t get it, what is so wrong with that?\u0027 \u0027Because it\u0027s absurd,\u0027 he snaps, and the mood of the room suddenly shifts. \u0027You can water and prune a plant but you cannot \"love\" a plant.\u0027 Julie opens her mouth to speak, then shuts it. \u0027It\u0027s a meaningless decoration. It sits there consuming time and resources, and then one day it decides to die, no matter how much you watered it. It\u0027s absurd to attach an emotion to something so pointless and brief.\u0027 There are a few long seconds of silence. Julie breaks away from her father\u0027s stare and pokes at her rice. \u0027Anyway,\u0027 she mumbles, \u0027my point was, Perry . . . that Dad used to be a gardener. So you should share gardening stories.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m interested in a lot more than gardening,\u0027 I say, racing to change the subject. \u0027Oh?\u0027 Mr Grigio says. \u0027Yeah, ah . . . motorcycles? I salvaged a BMW R 1200 R a while ago and I\u0027ve been working on bulletproofing it, getting it combat-ready just in case.\u0027 \u0027You have mechanical experience, then. That\u0027s good. We have a shortage of mechanics in the Armoury right now.\u0027 Julie rolls her eyes and shovels beans into her mouth. \u0027I\u0027m also spending a lot of time on my marksmanship. I\u0027ve been requesting extra assignments from school and I\u0027ve gotten pretty good with the M40.\u0027 \u0027Hey, Perry,\u0027 Julie says, \u0027why don\u0027t you tell Dad about your other plans? Like how you\u0027ve always wanted to - \u0027 I step on her foot. She glares at me. \u0027Always wanted to what?\u0027 her father asks. \u0027I don\u0027t - I\u0027m not really . . .\u0027 I take a drink of water. \u0027I\u0027m not really sure yet, sir, to be honest. I\u0027m not sure what I want to do with my life. But I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll have it figured out by the time I start high school.\u0027 What were you going to say? R wonders aloud, interrupting the scene again, and I feel a lurch as we swap places. Perry glances up at him - at me - frowning. \u0027Come on, corpse, not now. This is the first time I met Julie\u0027s father and it\u0027s not going well. I need to focus.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s going fine,\u0027 Julie tells Perry. \u0027This is my dad these days, I warned you about him.\u0027 \u0027You better pay attention,\u0027 Perry says to me. \u0027You might have to meet him someday, too, and you\u0027re going to have a much harder time winning his approval than I did.\u0027 Julie runs a hand through Perry\u0027s hair. \u0027Aw, babe, don\u0027t talk about the present. It makes me feel left out.\u0027 He sighs. \u0027Yeah, okay. These were better times anyway. I turned into a real neutron star when I grew up.\u0027 I\u0027m sorry I killed you, Perry. It\u0027s not that I wanted to, it\u0027s just - \u0027Forget it, corpse, I understand. Seems by that point I wanted out anyway.\u0027 \u0027I bet I\u0027ll always miss you when I think back to these days,\u0027 Julie says wistfully. \u0027You were pretty cool before Dad got his claws into you.\u0027 \u0027Take care of her, will you?\u0027 Perry whispers up to me. \u0027She\u0027s been through some hard stuff. Keep her safe.\u0027 I will. Mr Grigio clears his throat. \u0027I would start planning now if I were you, Perry. With your skill set, you should really consider Security training. Green shoots coming through the dirt are all well and good but we don\u0027t strictly need all these fruits and vegetables. You can live on nothing but Carbtein for almost a year before cell fatigue is even measurable. The most important thing is keeping us all alive.\u0027 Julie tugs on Perry\u0027s arm. \u0027Come on, do we have to sit through this again?\u0027 \u0027Nah,\u0027 Perry says. \u0027This isn\u0027t worth reliving. Let\u0027s go somewhere nice.\u0027 We\u0027re on a beach. Not a real beach, carved over the millennia by the master craft of the ocean - those are all underwater now. We\u0027re on the young shore of a recently flooded city port. Small patches of sand appear between broken slabs of sidewalk. Barnacled street lamps rise out of the surf, a few of them still flickering on in the evening gloom, casting circles of orange light on the waves. \u0027Okay, guys,\u0027 Julie says, throwing a stick into the water. \u0027Quiz time. What do you want to do with your life?\u0027 \u0027Oh, hi, Mr Grigio,\u0027 I mutter, sitting next to Julie on a driftwood log that was once a telephone pole. She ignores me. \u0027Nora, you go first. And I don\u0027t mean what do you think you will end up doing, I mean what do you want to do.\u0027 Nora is sitting in the sand in front of the log, playing with some pebbles and pinching a smouldering joint between her middle finger and the stub of her ring finger, missing past the first knuckle. Her eyes are earth brown; her skin is creamy coffee. \u0027Maybe nursing?\u0027 she says. \u0027Healing people, saving lives . . . maybe working on a cure? I could get into that.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-10.html","bookId":2434,"book":{"id":2434,"title":"Warm Bodies (Warm Bodies #1)","description":"Storyline: R is having a no-life crisis - he is a zombie.
