{"id":78594,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u0027Julie,\u0027 I say, bracing to confess my final sin. \u0027I need . . . to tell you . . .\u0027\\n\\n BANG.\\n\\n The Stadium\u0027s field halogens flare like suns and midnight becomes daylight. I can see every pore in Julie\u0027s face.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell?\u0027 she gasps, whipping her head around. A piercing alarm further shatters the night\u0027s stillness, and then we see it: the Jumbotron is aglow. Hanging from the upper reaches of the open roof like a tablet descending from Heaven, the screen plays a blocky animation of a quarterback running from what appears to be a zombie, arms outstretched and clutching. The screen blinks between this and a word that I think might be:\\n\\n BREACH\\n\\n \u0027R . . .\u0027 Julie says, horrified, \u0027did you eat someone?\u0027\\n\\n I look at her desperately. \u0027No ch . . . no choi . . . no choice,\u0027 I stutter, my diction collapsing in my state of panic. \u0027Guard . . . stopped me. Didn\u0027t . . . mean. Didn\u0027t . . . want.\u0027\\n\\n She presses her lips together, her eyes boring into me, then gives a single shake of her head as if banishing one thought, committing to another. \u0027Okay. Then we need to get inside. God damn it, R.\u0027\\n\\n We run into the house and she slams the door. Nora is at the top of the stairs. \u0027Where have you guys been? What\u0027s going on out there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a breach,\u0027 Julie says. \u0027Zombie in the Stadium.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mean him?\u0027\\n\\n The disappointment in her reply makes me wince. \u0027Yes and no.\u0027\\n\\n We hurry into Julie\u0027s bedroom and she turns out the lights. We all sit on the floor on the piles of laundry, and for a while nobody speaks. We just sit and listen to the sounds. Guards running and shouting. Gunfire. Our own heavy breathing.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 Julie whispers to Nora, but I know it\u0027s for me. \u0027It won\u0027t spread much. Those shots were probably Security taking them out already.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are we in the clear, then?\u0027 Nora asks. \u0027Will R be okay?\u0027\\n\\n Julie looks at me. Her face is grim. \u0027Even if they think the breach started from a natural death, that guard obviously didn\u0027t eat himself. Security will know there\u0027s at least one zombie unaccounted for.\u0027\\n\\n Nora follows Julie\u0027s eyes to mine, and I can almost imagine my face flushing. \u0027It was you?\u0027 she asks, straining for neutrality.\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t . . . mean. Was . . . going . . . kill me.\u0027\\n\\n She says nothing. Her face is blank.\\n\\n I meet her stare, willing her to feel my crushing remorse. \u0027It was my last,\u0027 I say, straining to force language back into my idiot tongue. \u0027No matter what. Swear to the skymouth.\u0027\\n\\n A few agonising moments pass. Then Nora slowly nods, and addresses Julie. \u0027So we need to get him out of here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They shut everything down for breaches. All the doors will be locked and guarded. They might even shut the roof if they get scared enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what the hell are we supposed to do?\u0027\\n\\n Julie shrugs, and the gesture looks so bleak on her, so wrong. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she says. \u0027Once again, I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n Julie and Nora fall sleep. They fight it for hours, trying to come up with a plan to save me, but eventually they succumb. I lie on a pile of pants and stare up at the starry green ceiling. Not so easy, Mr Lennon. Even if you try.\\n\\n It seems trivial now, a thin silver lining on a vast black storm cloud, but I think I\u0027m learning to read. As I look up at the phosphorescent galaxy, letters come together and form words. Stringing them into full sentences is still beyond me, but I savour the sensation of those little symbols clicking together and bursting like soap bubbles of sound. If I ever see my wife again . . . I\u0027ll at least be able to read her name tag.\\n\\n The hours ooze by. It\u0027s long after midnight, but bright as noon outside. The halogens ram their white light against the house, squeezing in through cracks in the window shades. My ears tune to the sounds around me. The girls\u0027 breathing. Their small shifting movements. And then, sometime around two in the morning, a phone rings.\\n\\n Julie comes awake, gets up on one elbow. In some distant room of the house, the phone rings again. She throws off her blankets and stands up. Strange to see her from this angle, towering over me instead of cowering under. I\u0027m the one who needs protecting now. One mistake, one brief lapse of my new-found judgement - that\u0027s all it took to unravel everything. What a massive responsibility, living as a moral being.\\n\\n The phone keeps ringing. Julie walks out of the bedroom and I follow her through the dark, echoing house. We step into what appears to be an office. There is a large desk covered in papers and blueprints, and on the walls various kinds of telephones are screwed to the Sheetrock, different brands and styles, all from different eras.\\n\\n \u0027They rerouted the phone system,\u0027 Julie explains. \u0027It\u0027s more like an intercom now. We have direct lines to all the important areas.\u0027\\n\\n Each phone has a name-tag sticker stuck below it, with the location Sharpied onto the blank. Hi, my name is:\\n\\n GARDENS\\n\\n KITCHENS\\n\\n WAREHOUSE\\n\\n GARAGE\\n\\n ARMOURY\\n\\n CORRIDOR 2\\n\\n GOLDMAN DOME\\n\\n AIG ARENA\\n\\n LEHMAN FIELD\\n\\n And so on.\\n\\n The phone that\u0027s ringing, a pea-green rotary dialler covered in dust, is labelled:\\n\\n OUTSIDE\\n\\n Julie looks at the phone. She looks at me. \u0027This is weird. That line is from the phones in the abandoned outer districts. Since we got walkie-talkies nobody uses it any more.\u0027\\n\\n The phone clangs its bells, loud and insistent. I can\u0027t believe Nora is still asleep.\\n\\n Slowly, Julie picks up the receiver and puts it to her ear. \u0027Hello?\u0027 She waits. \u0027What? I can\u0027t under - \u0027 Her brow furrows in concentration. Then her eyes widen. \u0027Oh.\u0027 They narrow. \u0027You. Yeah, this is Julie, what do you - \u0027 She waits. \u0027Fine. Yeah, he\u0027s right here.\u0027\\n\\n She holds the phone out to me. \u0027It\u0027s for you.\u0027\\n\\n I stare at it. \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s your friend. That fat fuck from the airport.\u0027\\n\\n I grab the phone. I put the earpiece to my mouth. Julie shakes her head and flips it around for me. Into the receiver I breathe a stunned, \u0027M?\u0027\\n\\n His deep rumble crackles in my ear. \u0027Hey . . . lover boy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s . . . Where are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Out in . . . city. Didn\u0027t know . . . what would get with . . . phone, but had . . . to try. You\u0027re . . . okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay but . . . trapped. Stadium . . . locked down.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s . . . going on? Out there.\u0027\\n\\n There is silence for a moment. \u0027R,\u0027 he says. \u0027Dead . . . still coming. More. From airport. Other places. Lots . . . of us now.\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027m silent. The phone wanders away from my ear. Julie looks at me expectantly.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 M says.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry. I\u0027m here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, we\u0027re . . . here. What now? What should . . . do?\u0027\\n\\n I rest the phone on my shoulder and look at the wall, at nothing. I look at the papers and plans on General Grigio\u0027s desk. His strategies are all gibberish to me. I have no doubt it\u0027s all important - food allocation, construction plans, weapon distribution, combat tactics. He\u0027s trying to keep everyone alive, and that\u0027s good. That\u0027s foundational. But like Julie said, there must be something even deeper than that. The earth under that foundation. Without that firm ground, it\u0027s all going to collapse, over and over, no matter how many bricks he lays. This is what I\u0027m interested in. The earth under the bricks.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 Julie asks. \u0027What\u0027s he saying?\u0027\\n\\n As I look into her anxious face, I feel the twitch in my guts, the young, eager voice in my head.\\n\\n It\u0027s happening, corpse. Whatever you and Julie triggered, it\u0027s moving. A good disease, a virus that causes life! Do you see this, you dumb fucking monster? It\u0027s inside you! You have to get out of these walls and spread it!\\n\\n I angle the phone towards Julie so she can listen. She leans in close.\\n\\n \u0027M,\u0027 I say.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell Julie.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell Julie . . . what\u0027s happening.\u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s a pause. \u0027Changing,\u0027 he says. \u0027Lots of us . . . changing. Like R.\u0027\\n\\n Julie looks at me and I can almost sense her neck hairs standing on end. \u0027It\u0027s not just you?\u0027 she says, moving away from the phone. \u0027This . . . reviving thing?\u0027 Her voice is small and tentative, like a little girl poking her head out of a bomb shelter after years of life in the dark. It almost quivers with tight-leashed hope. \u0027Are you saying the plague is healing?\u0027\\n\\n I nod. \u0027We\u0027re . . . fixing things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But how?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. But we have to . . . do more of it. Out there . . . where M is. \"Outside\".\u0027\\n\\n Her excitement cools, hardens. \u0027So we have to leave.\u0027\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n \u0027Both of us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Both,\u0027 M\u0027s voice crackles in the earpiece like an eaves-dropping mother. \u0027Julie . . . part of it.\u0027\\n\\n She eyes me dubiously. \u0027You want me. Skinny little human girl. Out there in the wild, running with a pack of zombies?\u0027\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n \u0027Do you grasp how insane that is?\u0027\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n She is silent for a moment, looking at the floor. \u0027Do you really think you can keep me safe?\u0027 she asks me. \u0027Out there, with them?\u0027\\n\\n My incurable honesty makes me hesitate, and Julie frowns.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 M answers for me, exasperated. \u0027He can. And I\u0027ll . . . help.\u0027\\n\\n I nod quickly. \u0027M will help. The others . . . will help. Besides,\u0027 I add with a faint smile, \u0027you can . . . keep yourself safe.\u0027\\n\\n She shrugs nonchalantly. \u0027I know. I just wanted to see what you\u0027d say.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you\u0027ll . . . ?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll go with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re . . . sure?\u0027\\n\\n Her eyes are distant and hard. \u0027I had to bury my mom\u0027s empty dress. I\u0027ve been waiting for this a long time.\u0027\\n\\n I nod. I take a deep breath.\\n\\n \u0027The only problem with your plan,\u0027 she continues, \u0027is that you seem to be forgetting you ate someone last night, and this place is going to stay clamped shut until they find and kill you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Should we . . . attack?\u0027 M says. \u0027Get you . . . out?\u0027\\n\\n I put the phone back to my ear, gripping the receiver hard. \u0027No,\u0027 I tell him.\\n\\n \u0027Have . . . army. Where\u0027s . . . battle?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. Not here. These are . . . people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027\\n\\n I look at Julie. She looks at the ground and rubs her forehead.\\n\\n \u0027Just wait,\u0027 I tell M.\\n\\n \u0027Wait?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A little longer. We\u0027ll . . . figure it out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Before . . . they kill you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hopefully.\u0027\\n\\n A long, dubious silence. Then: \u0027Hurry up.\u0027\\n\\n Julie and I stay up for the rest of the night. In our rain-wet clothes we sit on the floor in the cold living room and don\u0027t say a word. Eventually my eyes sag shut, and in this strange calm, in what may be my last few hours on Earth, my mind creates a dream for me. Crisp and clear, alive with colour, unfolding like a time-lapse rose in the sparkling darkness.\\n\\n In this dream, my dream, I am floating down a river on my housejet\u0027s severed tail fin. I am lying on my back under the blue midnight, watching the stars drift by above me. The river is uncharted, even in this age of maps and satellites, and I have no idea where it leads. The air is still. The night is warm. I\u0027ve brought only two provisions: a box of pad thai and Perry\u0027s book. Thick. Ancient. Bound in leather. I open it to the middle. An unfinished sentence in some language I\u0027ve never seen, and beyond it, nothing. An epic tome of empty pages, blank white and waiting. I shut the book and lay my head down on the cool steel. The pad thai tickles my nose, sweet and spicy and strong. I feel the river widening, gaining force.\\n\\n I hear the waterfall.\\n\\n \u0027R.\u0027\\n\\n My eyes open and I sit up. Julie is cross-legged next to me, watching me with grim amusement.\\n\\n \u0027Having some nice dreams?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not . . . sure,\u0027 I mumble, rubbing my eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Did you happen to dream up any solutions to our little problem?\u0027\\n\\n I shake my head.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, me neither.\u0027 She glances at the wall clock and bunches her lips ruefully. \u0027I\u0027m supposed to be at the community centre in a few hours to do story time. David and Marie are going to cry when I don\u0027t show up.\u0027\\n\\n David and Marie. I repeat the names in my head, savouring their contours. I would let Trina eat my whole leg for the chance to see those kids again. To hear a few more clumsy syllables tumble from their mouths before I die. \u0027What are . . . you reading them?\u0027\\n\\n She looks out of the window at the city, its every crack and flaw brought into sharp relief by the blinding white light. \u0027I\u0027ve been trying to get them into the Redwall books. I figured all those songs and feasts and courageous warrior mice would be a nice escape from the nightmare they\u0027re growing up in. Marie keeps asking for books about zombies and I keep telling her I can\u0027t read non-fiction for story time but . . .\u0027 She notices the look on my face and trails off. \u0027Are you okay?\u0027\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n \u0027Are you thinking about your kids at the airport?\u0027\\n\\n I hesitate, then nod.\\n\\n She reaches out and touches my knee, looking into my stinging eyes. \u0027R? I know things look bleak right now, but listen. You can\u0027t quit. As long as you\u0027re still breath - sorry, as long as you\u0027re still moving, it\u0027s not over. Okay?\u0027\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n \u0027Okay? Fucking say it, R.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay.\u0027\\n\\n She smiles.\\n\\n \u0027TWO. EIGHT. TWENTY-FOUR.\u0027\\n\\n We jolt away from each other as a speaker in the ceiling blares out a series of numbers followed by a shrill alert tone.\\n\\n \u0027This is Colonel Rosso with a community-wide notice,\u0027 the speaker says. \u0027The security breach has been contained. The infected officer has been neutralised, with no further casualties reported.\u0027\\n\\n I release a deep breath.\\n\\n \u0027However . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 Julie whispers.\\n\\n \u0027. . . the original source of the breach remains at large within our walls. Security patrols will now begin a door-to-door search of every building in the Stadium. Since we don\u0027t know where this thing might be hiding, everyone should come out of their houses and congregate in a public area. Donot confine yourself in any small spaces.\u0027 Rosso pauses to cough. \u0027Sorry about this, folks. We\u0027ll get it taken care of, just . . . sit tight.\u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s a click, and the PA goes quiet.\\n\\n Julie jumps to her feet and storms into the bedroom. She pulls open the blinds, letting the floodlights burst through the window. \u0027Rise and shine, Miss Greene, we\u0027re out of time. Do you remember any old exits in the wall tunnels? Wasn\u0027t there a fire escape somewhere by the sky box? R, can you climb a ladder yet?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wait, what?\u0027 Nora croaks, trying to shield her eyes. \u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027According to R\u0027s friend, maybe the end of this shitty undead world, if we don\u0027t get killed first.\u0027\\n\\n Nora finally comes awake. \u0027Sorry, what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you later. They just announced a sweep. We have maybe ten minutes. We need to find . . .\u0027 Her voice fades and I watch her mouth move. The shapes her lips make for each word, the flick of tongue against glistening teeth. She is holding onto hope but my grip is slipping. She twists at her hair as she talks, her golden tresses stiff and matted and in need of a wash.\\n\\n The spicy smell of her shampoo, flowers and herbs and cinnamon dancing with her natural oils. She would never say what brand she used. She liked to keep her scent a mystery.\\n\\n \u0027R!\u0027\\n\\n Julie and Nora are staring at me, waiting. I open my mouth to speak, but I have no words. And then the front door of the house bangs open so hard it resonates through the metal walls all the way to where we\u0027re standing. Heavy, booted footfalls pound the stairs.\\n\\n \u0027Oh Jesus,\u0027 Julie says in a panicked breath. She herds us out of the room and into the hallway bathroom. \u0027Get his makeup back on,\u0027 she hisses to Nora, and slams the door shut.\\n\\n As Nora fumbles with her compact and tries to re-rouge my rain-stained face, I hear two voices out in the hall.\\n\\n \u0027Dad, what\u0027s going on? Did they find the zombie?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not yet, but they will. Have you seen anything?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027ve been here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you alone?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I\u0027ve been here since last night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why is the bathroom light on?\u0027\\n\\n Footsteps pound towards us.\\n\\n \u0027Wait, Dad! Wait a second!\u0027 She lowers her voice a little. \u0027Nora and Archie are in there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why did you just tell me you\u0027re here alone? This is not a time for games, Julie, this is not a time for hide-and-seek.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re . . . you know . . . in there.\u0027\\n\\n There is the briefest of hesitations. \u0027Nora and Archie,\u0027 he shouts at the door, his voice compressed and extremely loud. \u0027As you just heard on the intercom there is a breach in progress. I cannot begin to imagine a worse time for lovemaking. Come out immediately.\u0027\\n\\n Nora straddles me against the sink and buries my face in her cleavage just as Grigio yanks the door open.\\n\\n \u0027Dad!\u0027 Julie squeals, flashing Nora a quick look as she jumps off me.\\n\\n \u0027Come out immediately,\u0027 Grigio says.\\n\\n We step out of the bathroom. Nora straightens her clothes and pats down her hair, doing a pretty good job of looking embarrassed. I just look at Grigio, unapologetic, limbering up my diction for its first and probably last big test. He looks back at me with that taut, angular face, peering into my eyes. There are less than two feet between us.\\n\\n \u0027Hello, Archie,\u0027 he says.\\n\\n \u0027Hello, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You and Miss Greene are in love?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That is wonderful. Have you discussed marriage?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not yet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why delay? Why deliberate? These are the last days. Where do you live, Archie?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Goldman . . . Field.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Goldman Dome?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir. Sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What work do you do at Goldman Dome.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gardens.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does that work allow you and Nora to feed your children?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t have children, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Children replace us when we die. When you have children you will need to feed them. I\u0027m told things are bad at Goldman Dome. I\u0027m told you are running out of everything. It\u0027s a dark world we live in, isn\u0027t it, Archie?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We do the best we can with what God gives us. If God gives us stones when we ask for bread, we will sharpen our teeth and eat stones.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Or make . . . our own bread.\u0027\\n\\n Grigio smiles. \u0027Are you wearing make-up, Archie?\u0027\\n\\n Grigio stabs me.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t even notice the knife coming out of its sheath. The five-inch blade sinks into my shoulder and pokes out the other side, pinning me to the drywall. I don\u0027t feel it and I don\u0027t flinch. The wound doesn\u0027t bleed.\\n\\n \u0027Julie!\u0027 Grigio roars, stepping back from me and drawing his pistol, his eyes wild in their deep sockets. \u0027Did you bring the Dead into my city? Into my home? Did you let the Dead touch you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dad, listen to me!\u0027 Julie says, holding her hands out towards him. \u0027R is different. He\u0027s changing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Dead don\u0027t change, Julie! They are not people, they are things!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do we know that? Just because they don\u0027t talk to us and tell us about their lives? We don\u0027t understand their thoughts so we assume they don\u0027t have any?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve done tests! The Dead have never shown any signs of self-awareness or emotional response!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Neither have you, Dad! Jesus Christ - R saved my life! He protected me and brought me home! He\u0027s human! And there are more like him!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Grigio says, abruptly calm. His hands stop wavering and the gun steadies, inches from my face.\\n\\n \u0027Dad, please listen to me? Please?\u0027 She takes a step closer. She is trying to stay cool but I can tell she is terrified. \u0027When I was at the airport, something happened. We sparked something, and whatever it is, it\u0027s spreading. The Dead are coming back to life, they\u0027re leaving their hives and trying to change what they are, and we have to find a way to help. Imagine if we could cure the plague, Dad! Imagine if we could clean up this mess and start over!\u0027\\n\\n Grigio shakes his head. I can see his jaw muscles tightening under his waxy skin. \u0027Julie, you are young. You don\u0027t understand our world. We can stay alive and we can kill the things that want to kill us, but there is no grand solution. We searched for years and never found one, and now our time is up. The world is over. It can\u0027t be cured, it can\u0027t be salvaged, it can\u0027t be saved.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes it can!\u0027 Julie screams at him, losing all composure. \u0027Who decided life has to be a nightmare?

He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he\u0027d rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization. And then he meets a girl. First as his captive, then his reluctant house guest, Julie is a blast of living color in R\u0027s gray landscape, and something inside him begins to bloom. He doesn\u0027t want to eat this girl - although she looks delicious - he wants to protect her. But their unlikely bond will cause ripples they can\u0027t imagine, and their hopeless world won\u0027t change without a fight.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1.jpg","author":"Isaac Marion","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:24 PM"}}
