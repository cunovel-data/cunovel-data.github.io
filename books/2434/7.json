{"id":78583,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u0027You need to corner sharper. You keep almost running off the road when you turn right.\u0027\n I crank the skinny leather wheel and drop my foot onto the accelerator. The Mercedes lurches forward, throwing our heads back.\n \u0027God, you\u0027re a leadfoot. Can you go easier on the gas?\u0027\n I come to a jerky stop, forget to push in the clutch, and the engine dies. Julie rolls her eyes and forces patience into her voice. \u0027Okay, look.\u0027 She restarts the engine, scoots over and snakes her legs across mine, placing her feet on my feet. Under her pressure, I smoothly exchange gas for clutch, and the car glides forward. \u0027Like that,\u0027 she says, and returns to her seat. I release a satisfied wheeze.\n We are cruising the tarmac, taxiing to and fro under the mild afternoon sun. Our hair ruffles in the breeze. Here in this moment, in this candy-red \u002764 roadster with this beautiful young woman, I can\u0027t help inserting myself into other, more classically filmic lives. My mind drifts, and I lose what little focus I\u0027ve been able to maintain. I veer off the runway and clip the bumper of a stair-truck, knocking the Boneys\u0027 church circle out of alignment. The jolt throws our heads to the side, and I hear my children\u0027s necks snap in the back seat. They groan in protest and I shush them. I\u0027m already embarrassed; I don\u0027t need my kids rubbing it in.\n Julie examines our dented front-end and shakes her head. \u0027Damn it, R. This was a beautiful car.\u0027\n My son lunges forward in another clumsy attempt to eat Julie\u0027s shoulder, and I reach back and smack him. He slumps into the seat with his arms crossed, pouting.\n \u0027No biting!\u0027 Julie reprimands, still inspecting the car\u0027s damage.\n As we circle back towards our home terminal, I notice the congregation emerging from a cargo loading gate. Like an inverted funeral procession, the Dead march out in a solemn line, taking slow, plodding steps towards the church. A clutch of Boneys leads the pilgrimage, moving forward with far more purpose than any of the flesh-clad. They are the few among us who always seem to know exactly where they\u0027re going and what they\u0027re doing. They don\u0027t waver, they don\u0027t pause or change course, and their bodies no longer either grow or decay. They are static. One of them looks directly at me, and I remember a Dark Ages etching I\u0027ve seen somewhere, a rotting corpse sneering at a plump young virgin.\n Quod tu es, ego fui, quod ego sum, tu eris.\n What you are, I once was.\n What I am, you will become.\n I break away from the skeleton\u0027s hollow stare. As we cruise past their line, some of the Fleshies glance at us with uninterest, and I see my wife among them. She is walking alongside a male, her hand woven into his. My kids spot her in the crowd and stand up on the back seat, waving and grunting loudly. Julie follows their gaze and sees my wife wave back at them. Julie looks at me. \u0027Is that like . . . your wife?\u0027\n I don\u0027t respond. I look at my wife, expecting some kind of rebuke. But there is almost no recognition in her eyes. She looks at the car. She looks at me. She looks straight ahead and keeps walking, hand in hand with another man.\n \u0027Is that your wife?\u0027 Julie asks again, more forcefully. I nod. \u0027Who\u0027s that . . . guy she\u0027s with?\u0027 I shrug. \u0027Is she cheating on you or something?\u0027 I shrug. \u0027This doesn\u0027t bother you?\u0027\n I shrug.\n \u0027Stop shrugging, you asshole! I know you can talk; say something.\u0027\n I think for a minute. Watching my wife fade into the distance, I put a hand on my heart. \u0027Dead.\u0027 I wave a hand towards my wife. \u0027Dead.\u0027 My eyes drift towards the sky and lose their focus. \u0027Want it . . . to hurt. But . . . doesn\u0027t.\u0027\n Julie looks at me like she\u0027s waiting for more, and I wonder if I\u0027ve expressed anything at all with my halting, mumbled soliloquy. Are my words ever actually audible, or do they just echo in my head while people stare at me, waiting? I want to change my punctuation. I long for exclamation marks, but I\u0027m drowning in ellipses.\n Julie watches me a moment longer, then turns to face the windshield and the oncoming scenery. On our right: the dark openings of empty boarding tunnels, once alive with eager travellers on their way to see the world, expand their horizons, find love and fame and fortune. On our left: the blackened wreckage of a Dreamliner.\n \u0027My boyfriend cheated on me once,\u0027 Julie says to the windshield. \u0027There was this girl his dad was housing while the foster homes were being set up, and they got blackout drunk one night and it just happened. It was basically an accident, and he gave me the most sincere and moving confession of all time, swore to God he loved me so much and would do anything to convince me, blah blah blah, but it didn\u0027t matter, I kept thinking about it and running it through my head and just burning with it. I cried every night for weeks. Practically wore the binary off all my saddest Mp3s.\u0027 She is shaking her head slowly. Her eyes are far away. \u0027Things are just . . . I feel things so hard sometimes. When that happened with Perry, I would have loved to be more . . . like you.\u0027\n I study her. She runs a finger through her hair and twists it around a little. I notice faint scars on her wrists and forearms, thin lines too symmetrical to be accidents. She blinks and glances at me abruptly, as if I just woke her from a dream. \u0027I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m telling you this,\u0027 she says, annoyed. \u0027Anyway, lesson\u0027s over for today. I\u0027m tired.\u0027\n Without further comment, I drive us home. I brake too late, and park the car with the bumper two inches into the grille of a Miata. Julie sighs.\n Later that evening we sit in the 747, cross-legged in the middle of the aisle. A plate of microwaved pad thai sits on the floor in front of Julie, cooling. I watch her in silence as she pokes at it. Even doing and saying nothing, she is entertaining to watch. She tilts her head, her eyes roam, she smiles and shifts her body. Her inner thoughts play across her face like rear-projection movies.\n \u0027It\u0027s too quiet in here,\u0027 she says, and stands up. She starts digging through my stacks of records. \u0027What\u0027s with all the vinyl? Couldn\u0027t figure out how to work an iPod?\u0027\n \u0027Better . . . sound.\u0027\n She laughs. \u0027Oh, a purist, huh?\u0027\n I make a spinning motion in the air with my finger. \u0027More real. More . . . alive.\u0027\n She nods. \u0027Yeah, true. Lot more trouble though.\u0027 She flips through the stacks and frowns a little. \u0027There\u0027s nothing in here newer than like . . . 1999. Is that when you died or something?\u0027\n Another obstacle to estimating my age: I have no idea what year we\u0027re in. 1999 could have been a decade ago or yesterday. One might try to deduce a timeline by looking at the crumbling streets, the toppled buildings, the rotting infrastructure, but every part of the world is decaying at its own pace. There are cities that could be mistaken for Aztec ruins, and there are cities that just emptied last week, TVs still awake all night roaring static, cafe omelettes just starting to mould.\n What happened to the world was gradual. I\u0027ve forgotten what it actually was, but I have faint, foetal memories of what it was like. The smouldering dread that never really caught fire till there wasn\u0027t much left to burn. Each sequential step surprised us. Then one day we woke up, and everything was gone.\n \u0027There you go again,\u0027 Julie says. \u0027Drifting off. I\u0027m so curious what you think about when you daze out like that.\u0027 I shrug, and she lets out an exasperated huff. \u0027And there you go again, shrugging. Stop shrugging, shrugger! Answer my question. Why the stunted musical growth?\u0027\n I start to shrug and then stop myself, with some difficulty. How can I possibly explain this to her in words? The slow death of Quixote. The abandoning of quests, the surrendering of desires, the settling in and settling down that is the inevitable fate of the Dead.\n \u0027We don\u0027t . . . think . . . new things,\u0027 I begin, straining to kick through my short-sheeted diction. \u0027I . . . find things . . . sometimes. But we don\u0027t . . . seek.\u0027\n \u0027Really,\u0027 Julie says. \u0027Well, that\u0027s a fucking tragedy.\u0027 She continues to dig through my records, but her tone starts to escalate as she speaks. \u0027You don\u0027t think about new things? You don\u0027t \"seek\"? What\u0027s that even mean? You don\u0027t seek what? Music? Music is life! It\u0027s physical emotion - you can touch it! It\u0027s neon ecto-energy sucked out of spirits and switched into sound waves for your ears to swallow. Are you telling me, what, that it\u0027s boring? You don\u0027t have time for it?\u0027\n There is nothing I can say to this. I find myself praying to the ghastly mouth of the open sky that Julie never changes. That she never wakes up one day to find herself older and wiser.\n \u0027Anyway, you\u0027ve still got some good stuff in here,\u0027 she says, letting her indignation deflate. \u0027Great stuff, really. Here, let\u0027s do this one again. Can\u0027t go wrong with Frank.\u0027 She puts on a record and returns to her pad thai. \u0027The Lady is a Tramp\u0027 fills the plane\u0027s cabin, and she gives me a crooked little smile. \u0027My theme song,\u0027 she says, and stuffs her mouth full of noodles.\n Out of morbid curiosity, I pull one off her plate and chew it. There is no taste at all. It\u0027s like imaginary food, like chewing air. I turn my head and spit it into my palm. Julie doesn\u0027t notice. She seems far away again, and I watch the colours and shapes of her thought-film flickering behind her face. After a few minutes, she swallows a bite and looks up at me.\n \u0027R,\u0027 she says in a tone of casual curiosity, \u0027who did you kill?\u0027\n I stiffen. The music fades out of my awareness.\n \u0027In that high-rise. Before you saved me. I saw the blood on your face. Whose was it?\u0027\n I just look at her. Why does she have to ask me this. Why can\u0027t her memories fade to black like mine. Why can\u0027t she just live with me alone in the dark, swimming in the abyss of inked-out history.\n \u0027I just need to know who it was.\u0027 Her expression betrays nothing. Her eyes are locked on mine, unblinking.\n \u0027No one,\u0027 I mumble. \u0027Some . . . kid.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s this theory that you guys eat brains because you get to relive the person\u0027s life. True?\u0027\n I shrug, trying not to squirm. I feel like a toddler caught finger-painting the walls. Or killing dozens of people.\n \u0027Who was it?\u0027 she presses. \u0027Don\u0027t you remember?\u0027\n I consider lying. I remember a few faces from that room; I could roll the dice and just pick one, probably some random recruit she didn\u0027t even know, and she would let it go and never bring it up again. But I can\u0027t do it. I can\u0027t lie to her any more than I can spit out the indigestible truth. I\u0027m trapped.\n Julie lets her eyes auger into me for a long minute, then she falters. She looks down at the stained airplane carpet. \u0027Was it Berg?\u0027 she offers, so quietly she\u0027s almost talking to herself. \u0027The kid with the acne? I bet it was Berg. That guy was a dick. He called Nora a mulatto and he was staring at my ass that entire salvage. Which Perry didn\u0027t even notice, of course. If it was Berg, I\u0027m almost glad you got him.\u0027\n I try to catch her gaze to make sense of this reversal, but now she\u0027s the one avoiding eye contact. \u0027Anyway,\u0027 she says, \u0027whoever killed Perry . . . I just want you to know I don\u0027t blame them for it.\u0027\n I tense again. \u0027You . . . don\u0027t?\u0027\n \u0027No. I mean, I think I get it. You don\u0027t have a choice, right? And to be honest . . . I\u0027d never say this to anyone, but . . .\u0027 She stirs her food. \u0027It\u0027s kind of a relief that it finally happened.\u0027\n I frown. \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027To be able to finally stop dreading it.\u0027\n \u0027Perry . . . dying?\u0027\n I instantly regret speaking his name. Rolling off my tongue, the syllables taste like his blood.\n Julie nods, still looking at her plate. When she speaks again her voice is soft and faint, the voice of memories longing to be forgotten. \u0027Something . . . happened to him. A lot of things, actually. I guess there came a point where he just couldn\u0027t absorb any more, so he flipped over into a different person. He was this brilliant, fiery kid, so weird and funny and full of dreams, and then . . . just quit all his plans, joined Security . . . it was scary how fast he changed. He said he was doing everything for me, that it was time for him to grow up and face reality, take responsibility and all that. But everything I loved about him - everything that made him who he was - just started rotting. He gave up, basically. Quit his life. Real death was just the next logical step.\u0027 She pushes her plate aside. \u0027We talked about dying all the time. He just kept bringing it up. In the middle of a wild makeout session he\u0027d stop and be like, \"Julie, what do you think the average life expectancy is these days?\" Or, \"Julie, when I die, will you be the one to cut off my head?\" Height of romance, right?\u0027\n She looks out of the airplane window at the distant mountains. \u0027I tried to talk him down. Tried really hard to keep him here, but over the last couple of years it got pretty clear to everyone. He was just . . . gone. I don\u0027t know if anything short of Christ and King Arthur returning to redeem the world could have brought him back. I sure wasn\u0027t enough.\u0027 She looks at me. \u0027Will he come back to life, though? As one of you?\u0027\n I drop my eyes, remembering the juicy pink taste of his brain. I shake my head.\n She is quiet for a while. \u0027It\u0027s not like I\u0027m not sad that he\u0027s gone. I am, I . . .\u0027 Her voice wobbles a little. She pauses, clears her throat. \u0027I really am. But he wanted it. I knew he wanted it.\u0027 A tear escapes one eye and she seems startled by it. She brushes it away like a mosquito.\n I stand up, take her plate, fold it into the trash bin. When I sit back down her eyes are dry but still red. She sniffs and gives me a weak smile. \u0027I guess I talk a lot of shit about Perry, but it\u0027s not like I\u0027m such a shiny happy person either, you know? I\u0027m a wreck too, I\u0027m just . . . still alive. A wreck in progress.\u0027 She laughs a quick, broken laugh. \u0027It\u0027s weird, I never talk about this stuff with anyone, but you\u0027re . . . I mean you\u0027re so quiet, you just sit there and listen. It\u0027s like talking to God.\u0027 Her smile drifts away and she is absent for a moment. When she speaks again her voice is cautious but flat, and her eyes roam the cabin, studying window rivets and warning labels. \u0027I used to do some drugs when I was younger. Started when I was twelve and tried almost everything. I still drink and smoke pot when I get the chance. I even had sex with a guy for money once, when I was thirteen. Not because I wanted the money - even back then money was pretty worthless. Just because it was awful, and maybe I felt like I deserved it.\u0027 She looks at her wrist, those thin scars like a grim concert entry stamp. \u0027All the shitty stuff people do to themselves . . . it can all be the same thing, you know? Just a way to drown out your own voice. To kill your memories without having to kill yourself.\u0027\n There is a long silence. Her eyes roam the floor and mine stay on her face, waiting for her to come home. She takes a deep breath, looks at me, and gives a little shrug. \u0027Shrug,\u0027 she says in a small voice, and forces a smile.\n Slowly, I stand up and go over to my record player. I pull out one of my favourite LPs, an obscure compilation of Sinatra songs from various albums. I don\u0027t know why I like this one so much. I once spent three full days motionless in front of it, just watching the vinyl spin. I know the grooves in this record better than the grooves in my palms. People used to say music was the great communicator; I wonder if this is still true in this post-human, posthumous age. I put the record on and begin to move the needle as it plays, skipping measures, skipping songs, dancing through the spirals to find the words I want to fill the air. The phrases are off-key, off-tempo, punctuated by loud scratches like the ripping of fascia tissue, but the tone is flawless. Frank\u0027s buttery baritone says it better than my croaky vocals ever could had I the diction of a Kennedy. I stand over the record, cutting and pasting the contents of my heart into an airborne collage.\n I don\u0027t care if you are called - scratch - when people say you\u0027re - scratch - wicked witchcraft - scratch - don\u0027t change a hair for me, not if you - scratch - \u0027cause you\u0027re sensational - scratch - you just the way you are - scratch - you\u0027re sensational . . . sensational . . . That\u0027s all . . .\n I leave the record to play out its normal repertoire and sit back down in front of Julie. She stares at me with damp, redrimmed eyes. I press my hand against her chest, feeling the gentle thump inside. A tiny voice speaking in code.\n Julie sniffs. She wipes a finger across her nose. \u0027What are you?\u0027 she asks me for the second time.\n I smile a little. Then I get up and exit the plane, leaving her question floating there, still unanswerable. In my palm I can feel the echo of her pulse, standing in for the absence of mine.\n That night, lying on the floor of Gate 12, I fall asleep. The new sleep is different, of course. Our bodies aren\u0027t \u0027tired\u0027, we aren\u0027t \u0027resting\u0027. But every so often, after days or weeks of unrelenting consciousness, our minds simply can\u0027t carry the weight any more, and we collapse. We allow ourselves to die, to shut down and have no thoughts at all for hours, days, weeks. However long it takes to regather the electrons of our ids, to keep ourselves intact a little longer. There\u0027s nothing peaceful or lovely about it; it\u0027s ugly and compulsory, an iron lung for the wheezing husks of our souls, but tonight, something different happens.\n I dream.\n Underdeveloped, murky, faded to sepia like centuries-old film, scenes from my old life flicker in the void of sleep. Amorphous figures walk through melting doorways into shadowy rooms. Voices crawl through my head, deep and slurring like drunken giants. I play ambiguous sports, I watch incoherent movies, I talk and laugh with anonymous blurs. Among these foggy snapshots of an unexamined life, I catch glimpses of a pastime, some passionate pursuit long ago sacrificed on the blood-soaked altar of pragmatism. Guitar? Dancing? Dirt bikes? Whatever it was, it fails to penetrate the thick smog choking my memory. Everything remains dark. Blank. Nameless.\n I have begun to wonder where I came from. The person I am now, this fumbling, stumbling supplicant . . . was I built on the foundations of my old life, or did I rise from the grave a blank slate? How much of me is inherited, and how much is my own creation? Questions that were once just idle musings have begun to feel strangely urgent. Am I firmly rooted to what came before? Or can I choose to deviate?\n I wake up staring at the distant ceiling. The memories, empty as they already were, evaporate completely. It\u0027s still night, and I can hear my wife having sex with her new lover behind the door of a nearby staffroom. I try to ignore them. I already walked in on them once today. I heard noises, the door was wide open, so I walked in. There they were, naked, awkwardly slamming their bodies together, grunting and groping each other\u0027s pale flesh. He was limp. She was dry. They watched each other with puzzled expressions, as if some unknown force had shoved them together into this moist tangle of limbs. Their eyes seemed to ask each other, \u0027Who the hell are you?\u0027 as they jiggled and jerked like meat marionettes.\n They didn\u0027t stop or even react when they noticed me standing there. They just looked at me and kept grinding. I nodded, and walked back to Gate 12, and this was the final weight that broke my mind\u0027s kneecaps. I crumpled to the floor and slept.\n I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m awake already, after just a few feverish hours. I still feel the weight of my accumulated thoughts bearing down on my tender brain, but I don\u0027t think I can sleep any more. A burr and a buzz tickle my mind, keeping me alert. I reach for the only thing that\u0027s ever helped in times like these. I reach into my pocket and pull out my last chunk of cerebrum.\n As residual life energy fades from the brain, the useless clutter is first to go. The movie quotes, the radio jingles, the celebrity gossip and political slogans, they all melt away, leaving only the most potent and wrenching of the memories. As the brain dies, the life inside clarifies and distils. It ages like a fine wine.\n The piece in my hand has shrivelled somewhat, taking on a brownish-grey tint. I\u0027ll be lucky to get another few minutes of Perry\u0027s life out of this, but what blazing, urgent minutes these will be. Closing my eyes, I pop it into my mouth and chew, thinking, Don\u0027t leave me yet, Perry. Just a little longer. Just a little more. Please.\n I erupt from the dark, crushing tunnel into a flash of light and noise. A new kind of air surrounds me, dry and cold, as they wipe the last smears of home off my skin. I feel a sharp pain as they snip something, and suddenly I am less. I am no one but myself, tiny and feeble and utterly alone. I am lifted and swung through great heights across yawning distances, and given to Her. She wraps around me, so much bigger and softer than I ever imagined from inside, and I strain my eyes open. I see Her. She is immense, cosmic. She is the world. The world smiles down on me, and when She speaks it\u0027s the voice of God, vast and resonant with meaning, but words unknowable, ringing gibberish in my blank white mind.\n She says -\n I am in a dark, crooked room, gathering medical supplies and loading them into boxes. A small crew of civilian recruits are with me on this salvage, all of them handpicked by Colonel Rosso except one. One of them picked herself. One of them saw a look in my eyes and worried. One of them wants to save me.\n \u0027Did you hear that?\u0027 Julie says, glancing around.\n \u0027No,\u0027 I reply instantly and keep loading.\n \u0027I did,\u0027 Nora says, brushing her frizzy curls out of her eyes. \u0027Pear, maybe we should - \u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re fine. We scoped it out, we\u0027re secure. Just work.\u0027\n They watch me constantly, tensed like hospital orderlies, ready to intervene. It changes nothing. I won\u0027t endanger them but I\u0027ll still find a way. When I\u0027m alone, when no one\u0027s looking, I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll make it happen. They keep trying and trying but the beauty of their love only drives me deeper. Why can\u0027t they understand it\u0027s too late?\n A noise. I hear it now. A rumble of footsteps up the staircase, a chorus of groans. Are Julie\u0027s ears so much more sensitive or have I stopped listening? I pick up my shotgun and turn -\n No, I blurt into the middle of the vision. Not this. This isn\u0027t what I want to see.\n To my surprise, everything halts. Perry looks up at me, the voice in the sky. \u0027These are my memories, remember? You\u0027re the guest here. If you don\u0027t want to see it, you can spit it out.\u0027\n This is a shock. The memory has come unscripted. Am I having a conversation with the very mind I\u0027m digesting? I don\u0027t know how much of this is actually Perry and how much is just me, but I\u0027m swept along.\n We should be seeing your life! I shout down at him. Not this! Why would you want your last thought to be a replay of your dirty, meaningless death?\n \u0027You think death isn\u0027t meaningful?\u0027 he retorts, chambering a round in his shotgun. Julie and the others wait in their positions like background props, fidgeting impatiently. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t you want to remember yours if you could? How else are you going to reverse-engineer yourself into something new?\u0027\n Something new?\n \u0027Of course, you dumb corpse.\u0027 He puts his eye to the sights and makes a slow scan of the room, holding for a moment on Berg. \u0027There are a thousand kinds of life and death across the whole metaphysical spectrum, not to mention the metaphorical. You don\u0027t want to stay dead for the rest of your life, do you?\u0027\n Well, no . . .\n \u0027Then relax, and let me do what I need to do.\u0027\n I swallow the lump in my throat and say, Okay . . .\n - pick up my shotgun and turn, just as the thundering footfalls reach our floor. The door blows open and they burst inside, roaring. We shoot them, we shoot them, we shoot them, but there are too many, and they\u0027re fast. I crouch over Julie, shielding her as best I can.\n No. Oh God. This is not what I wanted.\n A tall skinny one is suddenly behind me, grabbing my legs. I fall and hit the table and my vision flashes red. Everything is wrong, but as the red fades to black I still allow an exultant shout, one last selfish orgasm before I go to sleep for ever:\n Finally. Finally!\n And then -\n \u0027Perry.\u0027 A jab in my ribs. \u0027Perry!\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you go to sleep on me now.\u0027\n I open my eyes. An hour of sun glaring through my closed lids has faded all the colours of the world to bluish grey, like an old movie poster in a dying local video store. I turn my head to look at her. She smiles wickedly and jabs me again. \u0027Never mind. Go ahead and sleep.\u0027\n Beyond her face I see the looming white posts of the Stadium roof arches, and beyond that, the deep cerulean sky. I slowly alternate my focus between her and the sky, letting her face blur into a peach-and-gold cloud, then refocusing it.\n \u0027What?\u0027 she says.\n \u0027Tell me something hopeful.\u0027\n \u0027What kind of hopeful?\u0027\n I sit up, crossing my arms over my knees. I look out at the surrounding city, the crumbling buildings, the empty streets and the lonely sky, clean and blue and deathly quiet without its white-sketching airplanes.\n \u0027Tell me this isn\u0027t the end of the world.\u0027\n She lies there for a minute, looking up at the sky. Then she sits up and pulls one of her earbuds out of her tangled blonde hair. She gently plugs it into my ear.\n The warbled strumming of a broken guitar, the swelling of an orchestra, the oohs and ahhs of a studio choir, and John Lennon\u0027s weary, woozy voice, singing limitless undying love. Everyone playing this song is now bones in a grave, but here they are anyway, exciting and inviting me, calling me on and on. The final fade-out breaks something inside me, and tears squeeze out of my eyes. The brilliant truth and the inescapable lie, sitting side by side just like Julie and me. Can I have both? Can I survive in this doomed world and still love Julie, who dreams above it? For this moment at least, tied to her brain by the white wire between our ears, I feel like I can.\n Nothing\u0027s gonna change my world, Lennon chants, over and over. Nothing\u0027s gonna change my world.\n Julie sings a high harmony, and I murmur a low. There on the hot white roof of humanity\u0027s last outpost, we look out over our rapidly, hopelessly, irretrievably changing world, and we sing:\n Nothing\u0027s gonna change my world. Nothing\u0027s gonna change my world.\n I am staring at the airport ceiling again. I drop the last chunk of Perry\u0027s brain into my mouth and chew, but nothing happens. I spit it out like gristle. The story is over. The life is gone.\n I find my eyes burning again, craving tears that my ducts can\u0027t supply. I feel as if I\u0027ve lost someone dear. A brother. A twin. Where is his soul now? Am I Perry Kelvin\u0027s afterlife?\n I finally drift back to sleep. I\u0027m in the darkness. The molecules of my mind are still scattered, and I float through oily black space, trying to swipe them up like fireflies. Every time I go to sleep, I know I may never wake up. How could anyone expect to? You drop your tiny, helpless mind into a bottomless well, crossing your fingers and hoping that when you pull it out on its flimsy fishing wire it hasn\u0027t been gnawed to bones by nameless beasts below. Hoping you pull up anything at all. Maybe this is why I only sleep a few hours a month. I don\u0027t want to die again. This has become clearer and clearer to me recently, a desire so sharp and focused I can hardly believe it\u0027s mine: I don\u0027t want to die. I don\u0027t want to disappear. I want to stay. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-7.html","bookId":2434,"book":{"id":2434,"title":"Warm Bodies (Warm Bodies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n R is having a no-life crisis - he is a zombie. He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he\u0027d rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization. And then he meets a girl. First as his captive, then his reluctant house guest, Julie is a blast of living color in R\u0027s gray landscape, and something inside him begins to bloom. He doesn\u0027t want to eat this girl - although she looks delicious - he wants to protect her. But their unlikely bond will cause ripples they can\u0027t imagine, and their hopeless world won\u0027t change without a fight.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1.jpg","author":"Isaac Marion","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:24 PM"}}
