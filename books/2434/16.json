{"id":78592,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I am Perry Kelvin, and this is my last day alive. What a strange feeling, waking up to that awareness. All my life I have battled the alarm clock, pummelling the snooze button over and over with mounting self-loathing until the shame is finally strong enough to lever me upright. It was only on the brightest of mornings, those rare days of verve and purpose and clear reasons to live that I ever sprang awake easily. How strange, then, that I do today. Julie whimpers as I extract myself from her goosebumped arms and slip out of bed. She gathers my half of the blankets around her and curls up against the wall. She will sleep for hours more, dreaming endless landscapes and novas of colour both gorgeous and frightening. If I stayed she would wake up and describe them to me. All the mad plot twists and surrealist imagery, so vivid to her while so meaningless to me. There was a time when I treasured listening to her, when I found the commotion in her soul bitter-sweet and lovely, but I can no longer bear it. I lean over to kiss her goodbye, but my lips stiffen and I cringe away from her. I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t. I\u0027ll collapse. I pull back and leave without touching her. Two years ago today my father was crushed under the wall he was building, and I became an orphan. I have missed him for seven hundred and thirty days, my mother for even longer, but tomorrow I will not miss anyone. I think about this as I descend the winding stairs of my foster home, this wretched house of discards, and emerge into the city. Dad, Mom, Grandma, my friends . . . tomorrow I won\u0027t miss anyone. It\u0027s early and the sun is barely over the mountains, but the city is already wide awake. The streets are crawling with labourers, repair crews, moms pushing knobby-tyred strollers and foster-moms herding lines of kids like cattle. Somewhere in the distance someone is playing a clarinet; its quavery notes drift through the morning air like birdsong, and I try to shut it out. I don\u0027t want to hear music, I don\u0027t want the sunrise to be pink. The world is a liar. Its ugliness is overwhelming; the scraps of beauty make it worse. I make my way to the Island Street administrative building and tell the receptionist I\u0027m here for my seven o\u0027clock with General Grigio. She walks me back to his office and shuts the door behind me. The general doesn\u0027t look up from the paperwork on his desk. He raises one finger at me. I stand and wait, letting my eyes roam the contents of his walls. A picture of Julie. A picture of Julie\u0027s mother. A faded picture of himself and a younger Colonel Rosso in proper US Army uniforms, smoking cigarettes in front of a flooded New York skyline. Next to this, another shot of the two men smoking cigarettes, this time overlooking a crumbled London. Then bombed-out Paris. Then smouldering Rome. The general finally sets down his paperwork. He takes off his glasses and looks me over. \u0027Mr Kelvin,\u0027 he says. \u0027Sir.\u0027 \u0027Your very first salvage as team manager.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 \u0027Do you feel ready?\u0027 My tongue stalls for an instant as images of horses and cellists and red lips on a wine glass flicker through my mind, trying to knock me off course. I burn them like old film. \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 \u0027Good. Here is your exit pass. See Colonel Rosso at the community centre for your team assignments.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, sir.\u0027 I take the paperwork and turn to leave. But I pause on the doorway threshold. \u0027Sir?\u0027 My voice cracks a little even though I swore I wouldn\u0027t let it. \u0027Yes, Perry?\u0027 \u0027Permission to speak freely, sir?\u0027 \u0027Go ahead.\u0027 I moisten my dry lips. \u0027Is there a reason for all this?\u0027 \u0027Pardon me?\u0027 \u0027Is there a reason for us to keep doing all these things? The salvages and . . . everything?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t understand your question, Perry. The supplies we salvage are keeping us alive.\u0027 \u0027Are we trying to stay alive because we think the world will get better someday? Is that what we\u0027re working towards?\u0027 His expression is flat. \u0027Perhaps.\u0027 My voice becomes shaky and very undignified, but I can no longer control it. \u0027What about right now? Is there anything right now that you love enough to keep living for?\u0027 \u0027Perry - \u0027 \u0027Will you tell me what it is, sir? Please?\u0027 His eyes are marbles. A noise like the beginning of a word forms in his throat, then it stops. His mouth tightens. \u0027This conversation is inappropriate.\u0027 He lays his hands flat on his desk. \u0027You should be on your way now. You have work to do.\u0027 I swallow hard. \u0027Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.\u0027 \u0027See Colonel Rosso at the community centre for your team assignments.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 I step through the door and shut it behind me. In Colonel Rosso\u0027s office I conduct myself with utmost professionalism. I request my team assignments and he gives them to me, handing over the envelope with warmth and pride in his squinty, failing eyes. He wishes me luck and I thank him; he invites me to dinner and I politely decline. My voice does not crack. I lose no composure. Marching back through the community centre lobby I glance towards the gym and see Nora staring at me through the tall windows. She\u0027s wearing snug black shorts and a white tank top, as are all the pre-teens on the volleyball court behind her. Nora\u0027s \u0027team\u0027, her sad attempt to distract a few kids from reality for two hours a week. I walk past her without so much as a nod, and as I start to push the front doors open I hear her sneakers slapping the tile floor behind me. \u0027Perry!\u0027 I stop and let the doors swing shut. I turn around and face her. \u0027Hey.\u0027 She stands in front of me with her arms crossed, her eyes stony. \u0027So today\u0027s the big day, huh?\u0027 \u0027I guess so.\u0027 \u0027What area are you hitting? You got it all planned out?\u0027 \u0027The old Pfizer building on Eighth Ave.\u0027 She nods rapidly. \u0027Good, that sounds like a good plan, Perry. And you\u0027ll be all done and home by six, right? \u0027Cause remember we\u0027re taking you to the Orchard tonight. We\u0027re not letting you spend today moping alone like you did last year.\u0027 I watch the kids in the gym, bumping-setting-spiking, laughing and cursing. \u0027I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll make it. This salvage might go a little later than usual.\u0027 She keeps nodding. \u0027Oh. Oh, okay. Because that building is crooked and full of cracks and dead ends and you have to be extra careful, right?\u0027 \u0027Right.\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 She nods towards the envelope in my hand. \u0027You checked that yet?\u0027 \u0027Not yet.\u0027 \u0027Well, you should probably check it, Perry.\u0027 Her foot taps the floor; her body vibrates with restrained anger. \u0027You need to make sure you know everyone\u0027s profiles, strengths and weaknesses and all that. Mine, for instance, because I\u0027m on there.\u0027 My face goes blank. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Sure, I\u0027m going, Rosso put me on yesterday. Do you know my strengths and weaknesses? Is there anything on your agenda you think might be too hard for me? \u0027Cause I\u0027d hate to jeopardise your very first salvage as team manager.\u0027 I rip the top off the envelope and start scanning the names. \u0027Julie signed up, too, did she mention that?\u0027 My eyes flash up from the page. \u0027That\u0027s right, fucker, will that be a problem for you?\u0027 Her voice is strained to breaking. There are tears in her eyes. \u0027Is that a conflict at all?\u0027 I shove open the front doors and burst out into the cold morning air. Birds overhead. Those blank-eyed pigeons, those shrieking gulls, all the flies and beetles that eat their shit - the gift of flight dumped on Earth\u0027s most worthless creatures. What if it were mine instead? That perfect, weightless freedom. No fences, no walls, no borders; I would fly everywhere, over oceans and continents, mountains and jungles and endless open plains, and somewhere in the world, somewhere in all that distant untouched beauty, I would find a reason. I am floating in Perry\u0027s darkness. I am deep in the earth. Somewhere far above me are roots and worms and an inverted graveyard where the coffins are the markers and the headstones are what\u0027s buried, piercing down into the airy blue emptiness, hiding all the names and pretty epitaphs and leaving me with the rot. I feel a stirring in the dirt that surrounds me. A hand burrows through and grabs my shoulder. \u0027Hello, corpse.\u0027 We are in the 747. My piles of souvenirs are sorted and arranged in neat stacks. The aisle is softened with layers of oriental throw rugs. Dean Martin croons on the record player. \u0027Perry?\u0027 He\u0027s in the cockpit, in the pilot\u0027s chair with his hands on the controls. He\u0027s wearing a pilot\u0027s uniform, the white shirt stained with blood. He smiles at me, then gestures at the windows, where streaks of clouds flicker past. \u0027We are now approaching cruising altitude. You\u0027re free to move about the cabin.\u0027 With slow, cautious movements, I get up and join him in the cockpit. I look at him uneasily. He grins. I rub a finger through the familiar layers of dust on the controls. \u0027This isn\u0027t one of your memories, is it?\u0027 \u0027No. This is yours. I wanted you to be comfortable.\u0027 \u0027Is it your grave I\u0027m standing on right now?\u0027 He shrugs. \u0027I suppose. I think it\u0027s just my empty skull in there, though. You and your friends took most of me home for snacks, remember?\u0027 I open my mouth to apologise again, but he shuts his eyes and waves it away. \u0027Don\u0027t, please. We\u0027re past all that. Besides, that wasn\u0027t really me you killed, that was older-wiser Perry. I think this is mostly junior-high Perry you\u0027re talking to, young and optimistic and writing a novel called Ghosts vs. Werewolves. I\u0027d rather not think about being dead right now.\u0027 I eye him uncertainly. \u0027You\u0027re a lot more cheerful here than in your memories.\u0027 \u0027I have perspective here. It\u0027s hard to take your life so seriously when you can see it all at once.\u0027 I peer at him. His reality is very convincing, pimples and all. \u0027Are you . . . really you?\u0027 I ask. \u0027What does that mean?\u0027 \u0027All this time I\u0027ve been talking to you, are you just . . . leftovers from your brain? Or are you really actually you?\u0027 He chuckles. \u0027Does it really actually matter?\u0027 \u0027Are you Perry\u0027s soul?\u0027 \u0027Maybe. Kind of. Whatever you want to call it.\u0027 \u0027Are you . . . in Heaven?\u0027 He laughs and tugs his blood-soaked shirt. \u0027Yeah, not exactly. Whatever I am, \"R\", I\u0027m in you.\u0027 He laughs again at the look on my face. \u0027Fucked up, isn\u0027t it? But Older-Wiser went out of this life pretty darkly. Maybe this is our chance to catch up with him and work some things out before . . . you know. Whatever\u0027s next.\u0027 I look out the window. No glimpse of land or sea, just the silky mountains of Cloud World spread out below us and piled high above. \u0027Where are we headed?\u0027 \u0027Towards whatever\u0027s next.\u0027 He lifts his eyes to the heavens with sarcastic solemnity, then grins. \u0027You\u0027re going to help me get there, and I\u0027m going to help you.\u0027 I feel my guts twist as the plane surges and drops on erratic air currents. \u0027Why would you help me? I\u0027m the reason you\u0027re dead.\u0027 \u0027Come on, R, don\u0027t you get this yet?\u0027 He seems upset by my question. He locks eyes on me and there\u0027s a feverish intensity in them. \u0027You and I are victims of the same disease. We\u0027re fighting the same war, just different battles in different theatres, and it\u0027s way too late for me to hate you for anything, because we\u0027re the same damn thing. My soul, your conscience, whatever\u0027s left of me woven into whatever\u0027s left of you, all tangled up and conjoined.\u0027 He gives me a hearty clap on the shoulder that almost hurts. \u0027We\u0027re in this together, corpse.\u0027 A low tremor rumbles through the plane. The control stick wobbles in front of Perry, but he ignores it. I don\u0027t know what to say, so I just say, \u0027Okay.\u0027 He nods. \u0027Okay.\u0027 Another faint vibration in the floor, like the concussions of distant bombs. \u0027So,\u0027 he says. \u0027God has made us study partners. We need to talk about our project.\u0027 He takes a deep breath and looks at me, tapping his chin. \u0027I\u0027ve been hearing a lot of inspirational thoughts prancing around in our head lately. But I\u0027m not sure you really understand the storm we\u0027re flying into.\u0027 A few red lights blink on in the cabin. There is a scraping noise somewhere outside the plane. \u0027What am I missing?\u0027 I ask. \u0027How about a strategy? We\u0027re wandering around this city like a kitten in a dog kennel. You keep talking about changing the world, but you\u0027re sitting here licking your paws while all the pit bulls circle in on us. What\u0027s the plan, pussycat?\u0027 Outside, the cotton clouds darken to steel wool. The lights flicker, and my souvenir stacks rattle. \u0027I don\u0027t . . . have one yet.\u0027 \u0027So when? You know things are moving. You\u0027re changing, your fellow Dead are changing, the world is ready for something miraculous. What are we waiting for?\u0027 The plane shudders and begins to dive. I stumble into the co-pilot chair, feeling my stomach rise into my throat. \u0027I\u0027m not waiting. I\u0027m doing it right now.\u0027 \u0027Doing what? What are you doing?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m trying.\u0027 I hold Perry\u0027s gaze and grip the sides of my seat as the plane shakes and groans. \u0027I\u0027m wanting it. I\u0027m making myself care.\u0027 Perry\u0027s eyes narrow and his lips tighten, but he doesn\u0027t say anything. \u0027That\u0027s step one, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 I yell over the noise of wind and roaring engines. \u0027That\u0027s where it has to start.\u0027 The plane lurches and my souvenir stacks collapse, scattering paintings, movies, dishes, dolls and love notes all over the cabin. More lights flare in the cockpit, and a voice crackles on the radio. R? Helloooo? Are you okay? Perry\u0027s face has gone cold, all playfulness gone. \u0027Bad stuff is coming, R. Some of it\u0027s waiting for you right outside this graveyard. You\u0027re right, wanting change is step one, but step two is taking it. When the flood comes, I don\u0027t want to see you dreaming your way through it. You\u0027ve got my little girl with you now.\u0027 Okay, you\u0027re creeping me out. Wake up! \u0027I know I didn\u0027t deserve her,\u0027 Perry says, his quiet murmur somehow rising above the noise. \u0027She offered me everything and I pissed on it. So now it\u0027s your turn, R. Go keep her safe. She\u0027s a lot softer than she seems.\u0027 God damn it, you asshole! Wake up or I\u0027ll fucking shoot you! I nod. Perry nods. Then he turns to face the window and folds his arms across his chest while the controls shake wildly. The storm clouds peel apart and we are diving to Earth, hurtling directly towards the Stadium, and there they are, the infamous R and J, sitting on a blanket on the rain-soaked roof. R looks up and sees us, his eyes open wide just as we - My eyes open wide and I blink reality into focus. I am standing in front of a small grave in an amateur cemetery. Julie\u0027s hand is on my shoulder. \u0027Are you back?\u0027 she asks. \u0027What the hell was that about?\u0027 I clear my throat and look around. \u0027Sorry. Daydreaming.\u0027 \u0027God, you\u0027re weird. Come on, I don\u0027t want to be here any more.\u0027 She strides briskly towards the exit. Nora and I follow her. Nora keeps pace with me, eyeing me sideways. \u0027Daydreaming?\u0027 she asks. I nod. \u0027You were talking to yourself a little.\u0027 I look at her. \u0027Some pretty big words, too. I think I heard \"miraculous\".\u0027 I shrug. The waterfall noise of the city rushes into our ears as the guards open the doors and we step back into the Stadium proper. The doors have barely slammed shut behind us when I feel that baby kick in my stomach again. A voice whispers, Here it comes, R. Are you ready? \u0027Oh, this is lovely,\u0027 Julie says under her breath. There he is, marching around the street corner in front of us: Julie\u0027s dad, General Grigio. He strides directly towards us, flanked on each side by an officer of some kind, although none of them wear traditional military attire. Their uniforms are light grey shirts and work pants, no decorations or rank insignias, just pockets and tool loops and laminated ID badges. High-calibre side arms gleam softly in their belt holsters. \u0027Be cool, R,\u0027 Julie whispers. \u0027Don\u0027t say anything, just, um . . . pretend you\u0027re shy.\u0027 \u0027Julie!\u0027 the general calls out from an awkward distance. \u0027Hi, Dad,\u0027 Julie says. He and his retinue stop in front of us. He gives Julie\u0027s shoulder a quick squeeze. \u0027How are you?\u0027 \u0027Fine. Just went to see Mom.\u0027 His jaw muscle twitches, but he doesn\u0027t respond. He looks at Nora, gives her a nod, then looks at me. He looks at me very hard. He pulls out a walkie-talkie. \u0027Ted. The individual who slipped past you yesterday. You said it was a young man in a red tie? Tall, thin, poorly complected?\u0027 \u0027Dad,\u0027 Julie says. The walkie squawks. The general puts it away and pulls a pair of thumb cuffs from his belt. \u0027You are detained for unauthorised entry,\u0027 he recites. \u0027You will be held in - \u0027 \u0027Jesus Christ, Dad.\u0027 Julie steps forward to push his hands away. \u0027What is wrong with you? He\u0027s not an intruder, he\u0027s visiting from Goldman Dome. And he almost died on the way here so cut him some slack on the legalities, will you?\u0027 \u0027Who is he?\u0027 the general demands. Julie edges in front of me as if to block me from responding. \u0027His name is . . . Archie - it was Archie, right?\u0027 She glances at me and I nod. \u0027He\u0027s Nora\u0027s new boyfriend. I just met him today.\u0027 Nora grins and squeezes my arm. \u0027Can you believe what a nice dresser he is? I didn\u0027t think guys knew how to wear a tie any more.\u0027 The general hesitates, then puts the cuffs away and forces a thin smile. \u0027Pleased to meet you, Archie. You\u0027re aware of course that if you want to stay any longer than three days you\u0027ll need to register with our immigration officer.\u0027 I nod and try to avoid eye contact, but I can\u0027t seem to look away from his face. Although that tense dinner I witnessed in my visions couldn\u0027t have been more than a few years ago, he looks a decade older. His skin is thin and papery. His cheek-bones protrude. His veins are green in his forehead. One of the officers with him clears his throat. \u0027So sorry to hear about Perry, Miss Cabernet. We\u0027ll miss him very much.\u0027 Colonel Rosso is older than Grigio but has aged more gracefully. He is short and thick, with strong arms and a muscular chest above the inevitable old-man paunch. His thin hair is wispy and white, blue eyes big and watery behind thick glasses. Julie gives him a smile that seems genuine. \u0027Thanks, Rosy. So will I.\u0027 Their exchange sounds proper but rings false, as if paddling above deep undercurrents. I suspect they have already shared a less professional moment of grief somewhere away from Grigio\u0027s officious gaze. \u0027We appreciate your condolences, Colonel Rosso,\u0027 he says. \u0027However, I\u0027ll thank you not replace our surname when addressing my daughter, whatever such \"revisions\" she may have embraced.\u0027 The older man straightens. \u0027Apologies, sir. I meant nothing by it.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s just a nickname,\u0027 Nora says. \u0027Me and Perry thought she was more of a Cab than a . . .\u0027 She trails off under Grigio\u0027s stare. He pans slowly over to me. I avoid eye contact until he dismisses me. \u0027We have to be going,\u0027 he says to no one in particular. \u0027Good to meet you, Archie. Julie, I\u0027ll be in meetings all night tonight and then heading over to Goldman in the morning to discuss the merger. I expect to be back at the house in a few days.\u0027 Julie nods. Without another word, the general and his men depart. Julie examines the ground, seeming far away. After a moment, Nora breaks the silence. \u0027Well, that was scary.\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s go to the Orchard,\u0027 Julie mutters. \u0027I need a drink.\u0027 I\u0027m still looking down the street, watching her father shrink into the distance. Just before rounding a corner he glances back at me, and my skin prickles. Will Perry\u0027s flood be of water, gentle and cleansing, or will it be a flood of a different kind? I feel movement under my feet. A faint vibration, as if the bones of every man and woman ever buried are rattling deep in the earth. Cracking the bedrock. Stirring the magma.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-16.html","bookId":2434,"book":{"id":2434,"title":"Warm Bodies (Warm Bodies #1)","description":"Storyline: R is having a no-life crisis - he is a zombie.
