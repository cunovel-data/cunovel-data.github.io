My inevitable death, ignoring me all those years when I wished for it daily, arriving only after I\u0027ve decided I want to live for ever. I close my eyes and brace myself.\\n\\n A spatter of blood warms my face - but it\u0027s not mine. My eyes flash open just in time to see Julie\u0027s knife glancing off Grigio\u0027s hand. The gun flies out of his grip and fires when it hits the floor, then again and again as the recoil knocks it against the walls of the narrow hall like a ricocheting Superball. Everyone drops for cover, and the gun finally spins to rest touching Nora\u0027s toes. In the deafened silence she stares down at it, wide-eyed, then looks at the general. Cradling his gashed hand, he lunges. Nora snatches the gun off the floor and aims it at his face. He freezes. He flexes his jaw and inches forward as if about to pounce anyway. But then Nora pops out the spent ammo clip, whips a fresh one out of her purse, shoves it into the gun and chambers a round, all one liquid motion without ever taking her eyes off his. Grigio steps back.\\n\\n \u0027Go,\u0027 she says, her eyes flicking to Julie. \u0027Try to get out somehow. Just try.\u0027\\n\\n Julie grabs my hand. We back out of the room while her dad stands there vibrating with rage.\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye, Dad,\u0027 Julie says softly. We turn and run down the stairs.\\n\\n \u0027Julie!\u0027 Grigio howls, and the sound reminds me so much of another sound, a hollow blast from a broken hunting horn, that I shiver in my damp shirt.\\n\\n We are running. Julie stays in front, leading us through the cramped streets. Behind us, angry shouts ring out from the direction of Julie\u0027s house. Then the squawk of walkie-talkies. We are running, and we are being chased. Julie\u0027s leadership is less than decisive. We zigzag and backtrack. We are rodents scrambling in a cage. We run as the looming rooftops spin around us.\\n\\n Then we hit the wall. A sheer concrete barrier laced with scaffolding, ladders and walkways to nowhere. All the bleachers are gone, but one staircase remains; a dark hallway beckons to us from the top. We run towards it. Everything on either side of the staircase has been stripped away, leaving it floating in space like Jacob\u0027s ladder.\\n\\n A shout flies up from the ground below just as we reach the opening. \u0027Miss Grigio!\u0027\\n\\n We turn and look down. Colonel Rosso is at the bottom of the steps, surrounded by a retinue of Security officers. He is the only one without his gun drawn.\\n\\n \u0027Please don\u0027t run!\u0027 he calls to Julie.\\n\\n Julie pulls me into the hallway and we sprint into the dark.\\n\\n This inner space is clearly under construction, but most of it remains exactly as it was abandoned. Hot-dog stands, souvenir kiosks and overpriced pretzel booths sit cold and lifeless in the shadows. The shouts of the Security team echo behind us. I wait for the dead end that will halt us, that will force me to turn and face the inevitable.\\n\\n The hallway ends. In the faint light creeping through holes in the concrete, I see a sign on the door:\\n\\n EMERGENCY EXIT\\n\\n Julie runs faster, dragging me behind her. We slam into the door and it flies open -\\n\\n \u0027Oh shhh - \u0027 she gasps and whips around, grabbing onto the door frame as one foot dangles out over an eight-storey drop.\\n\\n Cold wind whistles around the doorway, where torn stumps of a fire escape protrude from the wall.\\n\\n Birds flutter past. Below, the city spreads out like a vast cemetery, high-rises like headstones.\\n\\n \u0027Miss Grigio!\u0027\\n\\n Rosso and his officers roll to a stop about twenty feet behind us. Rosso is breathing hard, clearly too old for hot pursuit.\\n\\n I look out the door at the ground below. I look at Julie. I look down again, then back at Julie.\\n\\n \u0027Julie,\u0027 I say.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure you want . . . to come with me?\u0027\\n\\n She looks at me, straining to force breath through her rapidly constricting bronchial tubes. There are questions in her eyes, maybe doubts, surely fears, but she nods. \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Please stop running,\u0027 Rosso groans, leaning over, hands on his knees. \u0027This is not the way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have to go,\u0027 she says.\\n\\n \u0027Miss Cabernet. Julie. You can\u0027t leave your father here. You\u0027re all he has left.\u0027\\n\\n She bites her lower lip, but her eyes are steely. \u0027Dad\u0027s dead, Rosy. He just hasn\u0027t started rotting yet.\u0027\\n\\n She grabs my hand, the one I shattered on M\u0027s face, and squeezes so hard I think she might break it even further. She looks up at me. \u0027Well, R?\u0027\\n\\n I pull her to me. I wrap my arms around her and hold tight enough to fuse our genes. We are face to face and I almost kiss her, but instead I take two steps backwards, and we fall through the doorway.\\n\\n We plummet like a shot bird. My arms and legs encircle her, almost completely enveloping her tiny body. We crash through a roof overhang, a support bar tears into my thigh, my head bounces off a beam, we tangle in a cellphone banner and rip it in half, and then, finally, we hit the ground. A chorus of cracks and crunches shoots through me as my back greets the earth and Julie\u0027s weight flattens my chest. She rolls off me, choking and gasping for breath, and I lie there staring up at the sky. Here we are.\\n\\n Julie raises herself on hands and knees and fumbles her inhaler out of her bag, takes a shot and holds it, supporting herself against the ground with one arm. When she can breathe again she crouches over me with terror in her eyes. Her face eclipses the hazy sun. \u0027R!\u0027 she whispers. \u0027Hey!\u0027\\n\\n As slow and shaky as the day I first rose from the dead, I lift myself upright and hobble to my feet. Various bones grind and crackle throughout my body. I smile, and in my breathy, tuneless tenor, I sing, \u0027You make . . . me feel so young . . .\u0027\\n\\n She bursts out laughing and hugs me. I feel the pressure snap a few joints back into place.\\n\\n She looks up at the open doorway. Rosso is framed in it, looking down at us. Julie waves to him, and he disappears back into the Stadium with a swiftness that suggests pursuit. I try not to begrudge the man his paradigm - perhaps in his world, orders are orders.\\n\\n So Julie and I run into the city. With each step I feel my body stabilising, bones realigning, tissues stiffening around cracks to keep me from falling apart. I\u0027ve never felt anything like this before. Is this some form of healing?\\n\\n We dash through the empty streets, past countless rusty cars, drifts of dead leaves and debris. We violate one-way streets. We blow stop signs. Ahead of us: the edge of town, the high grassy hill where the city opens up and the freeway leads elsewhere. Behind us: the relentless roar of assault vehicles gunning out of the Stadium gate. This cannot stand! declare the steel-jawed mouths of the rule makers. Find those little embers and stomp them out! With these howls at our backs, we crest the hill.\\n\\n We are face to face with an army.\\n\\n They stand in the grassy field next to the freeway ramps. Hundreds of them. They mill around in the grass, staring at the sky or at nothing, their grey, sunken faces oddly serene. But when the front line sees us they freeze, then pivot in our direction. Their focus spreads in a wave until the entire mob is standing at attention. Julie gives me an amused glance as if to say, Really? Then a disturbance ripples through the ranks, and a burly, bald, six-foot-five zombie pushes his way into the open.\\n\\n \u0027M,\u0027 I say.\\n\\n \u0027R,\u0027 he says. He gives Julie a quick nod. \u0027Julie.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hiiii . . .\u0027 she says, leaning into me warily.\\n\\n Our pursuers\u0027 tyres screech and we hear a rev of engines. They are very close. M steps up to the peak of the hill and the mob follows him. Julie huddles close to me as they sweep in around us, absorbing us into their odorous army, their rank ranks. It could be my imagination or a trick of the light, but M\u0027s skin looks less ashen than usual. His partial lips seem more expressive. And for the first time since I\u0027ve known him, his neatly trimmed beard is not stained with blood.\\n\\n The trucks barrel towards us, but as the swarm of the Dead rises into view on the hilltop, the vehicles slow down, then grumble to a stop. There are only four of them. Two Hummer H2s, a Chevy Tahoe and an Escalade, all spray-painted military olive drab. The hulking machines look small and pitiful from where we stand. The Tahoe\u0027s door opens, and Colonel Rosso slowly emerges. Clutching his rifle, he scans the row upon row of swaying bodies, weighing odds and strategies. His eyes are wide behind his thick glasses. He swallows, then lowers his gun.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Rosy,\u0027 Julie calls down to him, and points at the Stadium. \u0027I can\u0027t do it any more, okay? It\u0027s a fucking lie. We think we\u0027re surviving in there but we\u0027re not.\u0027\\n\\n Rosso is looking hard at the zombies arrayed around him, peering into their faces. He\u0027s old enough that he\u0027s probably been around since the beginning of all this. He knows what the Dead are supposed to look like, and he can tell when something\u0027s different, no matter how subtle, subliminal, subcutaneous.\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t save the world by yourself!\u0027 he yells. \u0027Come back and we can discuss this!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not by myself,\u0027 Julie says, and gestures at the forest of zombies swaying around her. \u0027I\u0027m with these guys.\u0027\\n\\n Rosso\u0027s lips twist in a tortured grimace, then he jumps in his vehicle, slams the door, and revs back towards the Stadium with the other three right behind. A brief respite, a quick suck of breath, because I know they aren\u0027t quitting, they can\u0027t quit, they\u0027re just gathering their strength, their weapons, their brute-force determination. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-19.html","bookId":2434,"book":{"id":2434,"title":"Warm Bodies (Warm Bodies #1)","description":"Storyline: R is having a no-life crisis - he is a zombie. He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he\u0027d rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization. And then he meets a girl. First as his captive, then his reluctant house guest, Julie is a blast of living color in R\u0027s gray landscape, and something inside him begins to bloom. He doesn\u0027t want to eat this girl - although she looks delicious - he wants to protect her.
