{"id":78577,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"I am dead, but it\u0027s not so bad. I\u0027ve learned to live with it. I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t properly introduce myself, but I don\u0027t have a name any more. Hardly any of us do. We lose them like car keys, forget them like anniversaries. Mine might have started with an \u0027R\u0027, but that\u0027s all I have now. It\u0027s funny because back when I was alive, I was always forgetting other people\u0027s names. My friend \u0027M\u0027 says the irony of being a zombie is that everything is funny, but you can\u0027t smile, because your lips have rotted off.\n None of us are particularly attractive, but death has been kinder to me than some. I\u0027m still in the early stages of decay. Just the grey skin, the unpleasant smell, the dark circles under my eyes. I could almost pass for a Living man in need of a vacation. Before I became a zombie I must have been a businessman, a banker or broker or some young temp learning the ropes, because I\u0027m wearing fairly nice clothes. Black slacks, grey shirt, red tie. M makes fun of me sometimes. He points at my tie and tries to laugh, a choked, gurgling rumble deep in his gut. His clothes are holey jeans and a plain white T-shirt. The shirt is looking pretty macabre by now. He should have picked a darker colour.\n We like to joke and speculate about our clothes, since these final fashion choices are the only indication of who we were before we became no one. Some are less obvious than mine: shorts and a sweater, skirt and a blouse. So we make random guesses.\n You were a waitress. You were a student. Ring any bells?\n It never does.\n No one I know has any specific memories. Just a vague, vestigial knowledge of a world long gone. Faint impressions of past lives that linger like phantom limbs. We recognise civilisation - buildings, cars, a general overview - but we have no personal role in it. No history. We are just here. We do what we do, time passes, and no one asks questions. But like I\u0027ve said, it\u0027s not so bad. We may appear mindless, but we aren\u0027t. The rusty cogs of cogency still spin, just geared down and down till the outer motion is barely visible. We grunt and groan, we shrug and nod, and sometimes a few words slip out. It\u0027s not that different from before.\n But it does make me sad that we\u0027ve forgotten our names. Out of everything, this seems to me the most tragic. I miss my own and I mourn for everyone else\u0027s, because I\u0027d like to love them, but I don\u0027t know who they are.\n There are hundreds of us living in an abandoned airport outside some large city. We don\u0027t need shelter or warmth, obviously, but we like having the walls and roofs over our heads. Otherwise we\u0027d just be wandering in an open field of dust somewhere, and that would be strangely horrific. To have nothing at all around us, nothing to touch or look at, no hard lines whatsoever, just us and the gaping maw of the sky. I imagine that\u0027s what being full-dead is like. An emptiness vast and absolute.\n I think we\u0027ve been here a long time. I still have all my flesh, but there are elders who are little more than skeletons with clinging bits of muscle, dry as jerky. Somehow it still extends and contracts, and they keep moving. I have never seen any of us \u0027die\u0027 of old age. Maybe we live for ever, I don\u0027t know. The future is as blurry to me as the past. I can\u0027t seem to make myself care about anything to the right or left of the present, and the present isn\u0027t exactly urgent. You might say death has relaxed me.\n I am riding the escalators when M finds me. I ride the escalators several times a day, whenever they move. It\u0027s become a ritual. The airport is derelict, but the power still flickers on sometimes, maybe flowing from emergency generators stuttering deep underground. Lights flash and screens blink, machines jolt into motion. I cherish these moments. The feeling of things coming to life. I stand on the steps and ascend like a soul into Heaven, that sugary dream of our childhoods, now a tasteless joke.\n After maybe thirty repetitions, I rise to find M waiting for me at the top. He is hundreds of pounds of muscle and fat draped on a six-foot-five frame. Bearded, bald, bruised and rotten, his grisly visage slides into view as I crest the staircase summit. Is he the angel that greets me at the gates? His ragged mouth is oozing black drool.\n He points in a vague direction and grunts, \u0027City.\u0027\n I nod and follow him.\n We are going out to find food. A hunting party forms around us as we shuffle towards town. It\u0027s not hard to find recruits for these expeditions, even if no one is hungry. Focused thought is a rare occurrence here, and we all follow it when it manifests. Otherwise we\u0027d just be standing around and groaning all day. We do a lot of standing around and groaning. Years pass this way. The flesh withers on our bones and we stand here, waiting for it to go. I often wonder how old I am.\n The city where we do our hunting is conveniently close. We arrive around noon the next day and start looking for flesh. The new hunger is a strange feeling. We don\u0027t feel it in our stomachs - some of us don\u0027t even have those. We feel it everywhere equally, a sinking, sagging sensation, as if our cells are deflating. Last winter, when so many Living joined the Dead and our prey became scarce, I watched some of my friends become full-dead. The transition was undramatic. They just slowed down, then stopped, and after a while I realised they were corpses. It disquieted me at first, but it\u0027s against etiquette to notice when one of us dies. I distracted myself with some groaning.\n I think the world has mostly ended, because the cities we wander through are as rotten as we are. Buildings have collapsed. Rusted cars clog the streets. Most glass is shattered, and the wind drifting through the hollow high-rises moans like an animal left to die. I don\u0027t know what happened. Disease? War? Social collapse? Or was it just us? The Dead replacing the Living? I guess it\u0027s not so important. Once you\u0027ve arrived at the the end of the world, it hardly matters which route you took.\n We start to smell the Living as we approach a dilapidated apartment building. The smell is not the musk of sweat and skin, but the effervescence of life energy, like the ionised tang of lightning and lavender. We don\u0027t smell it in our noses. It hits us deeper inside, near our brains, like wasabi. We converge on the building and crash our way inside.\n We find them huddled in a small studio unit with the windows boarded up. They are dressed worse than we are, wrapped in filthy tatters and rags, all of them badly in need of a shave. M will be saddled with a short blond beard for the rest of his Fleshy existence, but everyone else in our party is clean-shaven. It\u0027s one of the perks of being Dead, another thing we don\u0027t have to worry about any more. Beards, hair, toenails . . . no more fighting biology. Our wild bodies have finally been tamed.\n Slow and clumsy but with unswerving commitment, we launch ourselves at the Living. Shotgun blasts fill the dusty air with gunpowder and gore. Black blood spatters the walls. The loss of an arm, a leg, a portion of torso, this is disregarded, shrugged off. A minor cosmetic issue. But some of us take shots to our brains, and we drop. Apparently there\u0027s still something of value in that withered grey sponge, because if we lose it, we are corpses. The zombies to my left and right hit the ground with moist thuds. But there are plenty of us. We are overwhelming. We set upon the Living, and we eat.\n Eating is not a pleasant business. I chew off a man\u0027s arm, and I hate it. I hate his screams, because I don\u0027t like pain, I don\u0027t like hurting people, but this is the world now. This is what we do. Of course if I don\u0027t eat all of him, if I spare his brain, he\u0027ll rise up and follow me back to the airport, and that might make me feel better. I\u0027ll introduce him to everyone, and maybe we\u0027ll stand around and groan for a while. It\u0027s hard to say what \u0027friends\u0027 are any more, but that might be close. If I restrain myself, if I leave enough . . .\n But I don\u0027t. I can\u0027t. As always I go straight for the good part, the part that makes my head light up like a picture tube. I eat the brain and, for about thirty seconds, I have memories. Flashes of parades, perfume, music . . . life. Then it fades, and I get up, and we all stumble out of the city, still cold and grey, but feeling a little better. Not \u0027good\u0027, exactly, not \u0027happy\u0027, certainly not \u0027alive\u0027, but . . . a little less dead. This is the best we can do.\n I trail behind the group as the city disappears behind us. My steps plod a little heavier than the others\u0027. When I pause at a rain-filled pothole to scrub gore off my face and clothes, M drops back and slaps a hand on my shoulder. He knows my distaste for some of our routines. He knows I\u0027m a little more sensitive than most. Sometimes he teases me, twirls my messy black hair into pigtails and says, \u0027Girl. Such . . . girl.\u0027 But he knows when to take my gloom seriously. He pats my shoulder and just looks at me. His face isn\u0027t capable of much expressive nuance any more, but I know what he wants to say. I nod, and we keep walking.\n I don\u0027t know why we have to kill people. I don\u0027t know what chewing through a man\u0027s neck accomplishes. I steal what he has to replace what I lack. He disappears, and I stay. It\u0027s simple but senseless, arbitrary laws from some lunatic legislator in the sky. But following those laws keeps me walking, so I follow them to the letter. I eat until I stop eating, then I eat again.\n How did this start? How did we become what we are? Was it some mysterious virus? Gamma rays? An ancient curse? Or something even more absurd? No one talks about it much. We are here, and this is the way it is. We don\u0027t complain. We don\u0027t ask questions. We go about our business.\n There is a chasm between me and the world outside of me. A gap so wide my feelings can\u0027t cross it. By the time my screams reach the other side, they have dwindled into groans.\n At the Arrivals gate, we are greeted by a small crowd, watching us with hungry eyes or eye sockets. We drop our cargo on the floor: two mostly intact men, a few meaty legs and a dismembered torso, all still warm. Call it leftovers. Call it takeout. Our fellow Dead fall on them and feast right there on the floor like animals. The life remaining in those cells will keep them from full-dying, but the Dead who don\u0027t hunt will never quite be satisfied. Like men at sea deprived of fresh fruit, they will wither in their deficiencies, weak and perpetually empty, because the new hunger is a lonely monster. It grudgingly accepts the brown meat and lukewarm blood, but what it craves is closeness, that grim sense of connection that courses between their eyes and ours in those final moments, like some dark negative of love.\n I wave to M and then break free from the crowd. I have long since become acclimatised to the Dead\u0027s pervasive stench, but the haze rising off them today feels especially fetid. Breathing is optional, but I need some air.\n I wander out into the connecting hallways and ride the conveyors. I stand on the belt and watch the scenery scroll by through the window wall. Not much to see. The runways are turning green, overrun with grass and brush. Jets lie motionless on the concrete like beached whales, white and monumental. Moby-Dick, conquered at last.\n Before, when I was alive, I could never have done this. Standing still, watching the world pass by me, thinking about nearly nothing. I remember effort. I remember targets and deadlines, goals and ambitions. I remember being purposeful, always everywhere all the time. Now I\u0027m just standing here on the conveyor, along for the ride. I reach the end, turn around, and go back the other way. The world has been distilled. Being dead is easy.\n After a few hours of this, I notice a female on the opposite conveyor. She doesn\u0027t lurch or groan like most of us; her head just lolls from side to side. I like that about her, that she doesn\u0027t lurch or groan. I catch her eye and stare at her as we approach. For a brief moment we are side by side, only a few feet away. We pass, then travel on to opposite ends of the hall. We turn around and look at each other. We get back on the conveyors. We pass each other again. I grimace, and she grimaces back. On our third pass, the airport power dies, and we come to a halt perfectly aligned. I wheeze hello, and she responds with a hunch of her shoulder.\n I like her. I reach out and touch her hair. Like me, her decomposition is at an early stage. Her skin is pale and her eyes are sunken, but she has no exposed bones or organs. Her irises are an especially light shade of that strange pewter grey all the Dead share. Her graveclothes are a black skirt and a snug white blouse. I suspect she used to be a receptionist.\n Pinned to her chest is a silver name tag.\n She has a name.\n I stare hard at the tag, I lean in close, putting my face inches from her breasts, but it doesn\u0027t help. The letters spin and reverse in my vision; I can\u0027t hold them down. As always, they elude me, just a series of meaningless lines and blots.\n Another of M\u0027s undead ironies - from name tags to newspapers, the answers to our questions are written all around us, and we don\u0027t know how to read.\n I point at the tag and look her in the eyes. \u0027Your . . . name?\u0027\n She looks at me blankly.\n I point at myself and pronounce the remaining fragment of my own name. \u0027Rrr.\u0027 Then I point at her again.\n Her eyes drop to the floor. She shakes her head. She doesn\u0027t remember. She doesn\u0027t even have syllable-one, like M and I do. She is no one. But aren\u0027t I expecting too much? I reach out and take her hand. We walk off the conveyers with our arms stretched across the divider.\n This female and I have fallen in love. Or what\u0027s left of it.\n I remember what love was like before. There were complex emotional and biological factors at work. We had elaborate tests to pass, connections to forge, ups and downs and tears and whirlwinds. It was an ordeal, an exercise in agony, but it was alive. The new love is simpler. Easier. But small.\n My girlfriend doesn\u0027t talk much. We walk through the echoing corridors of the airport, occasionally passing someone staring out of a window or at a wall. I try to think of things to say but nothing comes, and if something did come I probably couldn\u0027t say it. This is my great obstacle, the biggest of all the boulders littering my path. In my mind I am eloquent; I can climb intricate scaffolds of words to reach the highest cathedral ceilings and paint my thoughts. But when I open my mouth, everything collapses. So far my personal record is four rolling syllables before some . . . thing . . . jams. And I may be the most loquacious zombie in this airport.\n I don\u0027t know why we don\u0027t speak. I can\u0027t explain the suffocating silence that hangs over our world, cutting us off from each other like prison-visit Plexiglas. Prepositions are painful, articles are arduous, adjectives are wild overachievements. Is this muteness a real physical handicap? One of the many symptoms of being Dead? Or do we just have nothing left to say?\n I attempt conversation with my girlfriend, testing out a few awkward phrases and shallow questions, trying to get a reaction out of her, any twitch of wit. But she just looks at me like I\u0027m weird.\n We wander for a few hours, directionless, then she grips my hand and starts leading me somewhere. We stumble our way down the halted escalators and out onto the tarmac. I sigh wearily.\n She is taking me to church.\n The Dead have built a sanctuary on the runway. At some point in the distant past someone pushed all the stair-trucks together into a circle, forming a kind of amphitheatre. We gather here, we stand here, we lift our arms and moan. The ancient Boneys wave their skeletal limbs in the centre circle, rasping out dry, wordless sermons through toothy grins. I don\u0027t understand what this is. I don\u0027t think any of us do. But it\u0027s the only time we willingly gather under the open sky. That vast cosmic mouth, distant mountains like teeth in the skull of God, yawning wide to devour us. To swallow us down to where we probably belong.\n My girlfriend appears much more devout than I do. She closes her eyes and waves her arms in a way that almost looks heartfelt. I stand next to her and hold my hands in the air silently. At some unknown cue, maybe drawn by her fervour, the Boneys stop their preaching and stare at us. One of them comes forward, climbs our stairs, and takes us both by the wrists. It leads us down into the circle and raises our hands in its clawed grip. It lets out a kind of roar, an unearthly sound like a blast of air through a broken hunting horn, shockingly loud, frightening birds out of trees.\n The congregation murmurs in response, and it\u0027s done. We are married.\n We step back onto the stair seats. The service resumes. My new wife closes her eyes and waves her arms.\n The day after our wedding, we have children. A small group of Boneys stops us in the hall and presents them to us. A boy and a girl, both around six years old. The boy is curly blond, with grey skin and grey eyes, perhaps once Caucasian. The girl is darker, with black hair and ashy brown skin, deeply shadowed around her steely eyes. She may have been Arab. The Boneys nudge them forward and they give us tentative smiles, hug our legs. I pat them on their heads and ask their names, but they don\u0027t have any. I sigh, and my wife and I keep walking, hand in hand with our new children.\n I wasn\u0027t exactly expecting this. This is a big responsibility. The young Dead don\u0027t have the natural feeding instincts the adults do. They have to be tended and trained. And they will never grow up. Stunted by our curse, they will stay small and rot, then become little skeletons, animate but empty, their brains rattling stiff in their skulls, repeating their routines and rituals until one day, I can only assume, the bones themselves will disintegrate, and they\u0027ll just be gone.\n Look at them. Watch them as my wife and I release their hands and they wander outside to play. They tease each other and grin. They play with things that aren\u0027t even toys: staplers and mugs and calculators. They giggle and laugh, though it sounds choked through their dry throats. We\u0027ve bleached their brains, robbed them of breath, but they still cling to the cliff edge. They resist our curse for as long as they possibly can.\n I watch them disappear into the pale daylight at the end of the hall. Deep inside me, in some dark and cobwebbed chamber, I feel something twitch.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-1.html","bookId":2434,"book":{"id":2434,"title":"Warm Bodies (Warm Bodies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n R is having a no-life crisis - he is a zombie.
