{"id":78580,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The cracked pavement rumbles under our truck\u0027s tyres. It abuses the old Ford\u0027s creaky suspension, making a quiet roar like stifled rage. I look at my dad. He looks older than I remember. Weaker. He grips the steering wheel hard. His knuckles are white.\\n\\n \u0027Dad?\u0027 I say.\\n\\n \u0027What, Perry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where are we going to go?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Someplace safe.\u0027\\n\\n I watch him carefully. \u0027Are there still safe places?\u0027\\n\\n He hesitates, too long. \u0027Someplace safer.\u0027\\n\\n Behind us, in the valley where we used to swim and pick strawberries, eat pizza and go to movies, the valley where I was born and grew up and discovered everything that\u0027s now inside me, plumes of smoke rise. The gas station where I bought Coke Slushies is on fire. The windows of my grade school are shattered. The kids in the public swimming pool are not swimming.\\n\\n \u0027Dad?\u0027 I say.\\n\\n \u0027What.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is Mom coming back?\u0027\\n\\n My dad finally looks at me, but says nothing.\\n\\n \u0027As one of them?\u0027\\n\\n He looks back at the road. \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I thought she would. I thought everyone comes back now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Perry,\u0027 my dad says, and the word seems to barely escape his throat. \u0027I fixed it. So she won\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n The hard lines in his face fascinate and repel me. My voice cracks. \u0027Why, Dad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because she\u0027s gone. No one comes back. Not really. Do you understand that?\u0027\\n\\n The scrub brush and barren hills ahead start to blur in my vision. I try to focus on the windshield itself, the crushed bugs and tiny fractures. Those blur, too.\\n\\n \u0027Just remember her,\u0027 my dad says. \u0027As much as you can, for as long as you can. That\u0027s how she comes back. We make her live. Not some ridiculous curse.\u0027\\n\\n I watch his face, trying to read the truth in his squinted eyes. I\u0027ve never heard him talk like this.\\n\\n \u0027Bodies are just meat,\u0027 he says. \u0027The part of her that matters most . . . we get to keep that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Julie.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come here. Look at this.\u0027\\n\\n The wind makes a ripping sound through the shattered plate glass of the hospital we\u0027re salvaging. Julie steps to the window\u0027s edge with me and looks down.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s it doing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n On the snow-dusted street below, a single zombie walks in a loose circle. It bumps into a car and stumbles, slowly backs up against a wall, turns, shuffles in another direction. It makes no sound and doesn\u0027t seem to be looking at anything. Julie and I watch it for a few minutes.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t like this,\u0027 she says.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s . . . sad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s wrong with it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n It stops in the middle of the street, swaying slightly. Its face displays absolutely nothing. Just skin stretched over a skull.\\n\\n \u0027I wonder how it feels,\u0027 she says.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To be like them.\u0027\\n\\n I watch the zombie. It starts swaying a little harder, then it collapses. It lies there on its side, staring at the frozen pavement.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s it . . . ?\u0027 Julie starts, then stops. She looks at me with wide eyes, then back at the crumpled body. \u0027Did it just die?\u0027\\n\\n We wait in silence. The corpse doesn\u0027t move. I feel a wriggling sensation inside me, tiny things creeping down my spine.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s go,\u0027 Julie says, and turns away. I follow her back into the building. We can\u0027t think of anything to say all the way home.\\n\\n Stop.\\n\\n Breathe those useless breaths. Drop this piece of life you\u0027re holding to your lips. Where are you? How long have you been here? Stop now. You have to stop.\\n\\n Squeeze shut your stinging eyes, and take another bite. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-4.html","bookId":2434,"book":{"id":2434,"title":"Warm Bodies (Warm Bodies #1)","description":"Storyline: R is having a no-life crisis - he is a zombie. He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he\u0027d rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization. And then he meets a girl. First as his captive, then his reluctant house guest, Julie is a blast of living color in R\u0027s gray landscape, and something inside him begins to bloom. He doesn\u0027t want to eat this girl - although she looks delicious - he wants to protect her. But their unlikely bond will cause ripples they can\u0027t imagine, and their hopeless world won\u0027t change without a fight.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1.jpg","author":"Isaac Marion","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:24 PM"}}
