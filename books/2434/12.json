{"id":78588,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"I am young. I am a teenage boy aflame with health, strong and virile and pounding with energy. But I get older. Every second ages me. My cells spread themselves thinner, stiffening, cooling, darkening. I am fifteen, but each death around me adds a decade. Each atrocity, each tragedy, each small moment of sadness. Soon I will be ancient. Here I am, Perry Kelvin in the Stadium. I hear birds in the walls. The bovine moans of pigeons, the musical chirps of starlings. I look up and breathe deep. The air is so much cleaner lately, even here. I wonder if this is what the world smelled like when it was new, centuries before smokestacks. It frustrates and fascinates me that we\u0027ll never know for sure, that despite the best efforts of historians and scientists and poets, there are some things we\u0027ll just never know. What the first song sounded like. How it felt to see the first photograph. Who kissed the first kiss, and if it was any good. \u0027Perry!\u0027 I smile and wave at my little admirer as he and his dozen foster-siblings cross the street in a line, hand in hand. \u0027Hey . . . buddy,\u0027 I call to him. I can never remember his name. \u0027We\u0027re going to the gardens!\u0027 \u0027Cool!\u0027 Julie Grigio grins at me, leading their line like a mother swan. In a city of thousands I run into her almost every day, sometimes near the schools where it seems probable, sometimes in the outermost corners of the Stadium where the odds are slim. Is she stalking me or am I stalking her? Either way, I feel a pulse of stress hormones shoot through me every time I see her, rushing to my palms to make them sweat and to my face to make it pimply. Last time we met, she took me up on the roof. We listened to music for hours, and when the sun went down, I\u0027m pretty sure we almost kissed. \u0027Want to come with us, Perry?\u0027 she says. \u0027It\u0027s a field trip!\u0027 \u0027Oh fun . . . a field trip to where I just spent eight hours working.\u0027 \u0027Hey, there aren\u0027t a lot of options in this place.\u0027 \u0027So I\u0027ve noticed.\u0027 She waves for me to come over and I immediately comply, while trying my best to look reluctant. \u0027Don\u0027t they ever get to go outside?\u0027 I wonder, watching the kids march in clumsy lockstep. \u0027Mrs Grau would say we are outside.\u0027 \u0027I mean outside. Trees, rivers, etc.\u0027 \u0027Not till they\u0027re twelve.\u0027 \u0027Awful.\u0027 \u0027Yeah . . .\u0027 We walk in silence except for the burble of child-speak behind us. The Stadium walls loom protectively like the parents these kids will never know. My excitement at seeing Julie darkens under a sudden cloud of melancholy. \u0027How do you stand it here,\u0027 I say, barely a question. Julie frowns at me. \u0027We get to go out. Twice a month.\u0027 \u0027I know, but . . .\u0027 She waits. \u0027What, Perry?\u0027 \u0027Do you ever wonder if it\u0027s even worth it?\u0027 I gesture vaguely at the walls. \u0027All this?\u0027 Her expression sharpens. \u0027I mean, are we really that much better off in here?\u0027 \u0027Perry,\u0027 she snaps with unexpected vehemence. \u0027Don\u0027t you start talking like that, don\u0027t you fucking start.\u0027 She notices the abrupt silence behind us and cringes. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 she says to the kids in a confidential whisper. \u0027Bad words.\u0027 \u0027Fuck!\u0027 my little friend yells, and the whole line explodes with laughter. Julie rolls her eyes. \u0027Great.\u0027 \u0027Tsk tsk.\u0027 \u0027You shut your mouth. I meant what I said to you. That\u0027s evil talk.\u0027 I look at her uncertainly. \u0027We get to go outside twice a month. More if we\u0027re on salvage. And we get to stay alive.\u0027 She sounds like she\u0027s reciting a Bible verse. An old proverb. As if sensing her own lack of conviction she glances at me, then snaps her eyes forward. Her voice goes quiet. \u0027No more evil talk if you want to come on our field trip.\u0027 \u0027Sorry.\u0027 \u0027You haven\u0027t been here long enough. You grew up in a safe place. You don\u0027t understand the dangers.\u0027 Dark feelings flood my belly at this, but I manage to hold my tongue. I don\u0027t know the pain she\u0027s speaking from, but I know it\u0027s deep. It makes her hard and yet so terribly soft. It\u0027s her thorns and it\u0027s her hand reaching out from the thicket. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 I say again and fumble for that hand, nudging it out of her jeans pocket. It\u0027s warm. My cold fingers wrap around hers, and my mind conjures an unwelcome image of tentacles. I blink it away. \u0027No more evil talk.\u0027 The kids gaze at me eagerly, huge eyes, spotless cheeks. I wonder what they are and what they mean and what\u0027s going to happen to them. \u0027Dad.\u0027 \u0027Yeah?\u0027 \u0027I think I have a girlfriend.\u0027 My dad lowers his clipboard, adjusts his hard hat. A smile creeps into the deep creases of his face. \u0027Really.\u0027 \u0027I think so.\u0027 \u0027Who?\u0027 \u0027Julie Grigio?\u0027 He nods. \u0027I\u0027ve met her. She\u0027s - hey! Doug!\u0027 He leans over the edge of the bulwark and yells at a worker carrying a steel pylon. \u0027That\u0027s forty-gauge, Doug, we\u0027re using fifty for the arterial sections.\u0027 He looks back at me. \u0027She\u0027s cute. Watch out though; seems like a firecracker.\u0027 \u0027I like firecrackers.\u0027 My dad smiles. His eyes drift. \u0027Me too, kid.\u0027 His walkie-talkie crackles and he pulls it out, starts giving instructions. I look out at the ugly concrete vista under construction. We are standing on the terminating end of a wall, fifteen feet high, currently a few blocks long. Another wall runs parallel to it, making Main Street into an enclosed corridor that cuts through the heart of the city. Workers swarm below, laying concrete pour-forms, erecting framework. \u0027Dad?\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 \u0027Do you think it\u0027s stupid?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027To fall in love.\u0027 He pauses, then puts his walkie away. \u0027What do you mean, Pear.\u0027 \u0027Like . . . now. The way things are now. I mean, everything\u0027s so uncertain . . . is it stupid to waste time on stuff like that in a world like this? When everything might fall apart any minute?\u0027 My dad looks at me for a long time. \u0027When I met your mom,\u0027 he says, \u0027I asked myself that. And all we had going on back then was a few wars and recessions.\u0027 His walkie starts crackling again. He ignores it. \u0027I got nineteen years with your mom. But do you think I would\u0027ve turned down the idea if I\u0027d known I\u0027d only get one year? Or one month?\u0027 He surveys the construction, shaking his head slowly. \u0027There\u0027s no benchmark for how life\u0027s \"supposed\" to happen, Perry. There is no ideal world for you to wait around for. The world is always just what it is now, and it\u0027s up to you how you respond to it.\u0027 I look into the dark window holes of ruined office buildings. I imagine the skeletons of their occupants still sitting at their desks, working towards quotas they will never meet. \u0027What if you\u0027d only gotten a week with her?\u0027 \u0027Perry . . .\u0027 my dad says, slightly amazed. \u0027The world isn\u0027t ending tomorrow, buddy. Okay? We\u0027re working on fixing it. Look.\u0027 He points at the work crews below. \u0027We\u0027re building roads. We\u0027re going to connect to the other stadiums and hideouts, bring the enclaves together, pool our research and resources, maybe start working on a cure.\u0027 My dad claps me on the shoulder. \u0027You and me, everyone . . . we\u0027re going to make it. Don\u0027t give up on us yet. Okay?\u0027 I relent with a small release of breath. \u0027Okay.\u0027 \u0027Promise?\u0027 \u0027Promise.\u0027 My dad smiles. \u0027I\u0027ll hold you to that.\u0027 Do you know what happened next, corpse? Perry whispers from the deep shadows of my awareness. Can you guess? \u0027Why are you showing me all this,\u0027 I ask the darkness. Because it\u0027s what\u0027s left of me, and I want you to feel it. I\u0027m not ready to disappear. \u0027Neither am I.\u0027 I sense a cold smile in his voice. Good. \u0027There you are.\u0027 Julie heaves herself up the ladder and stands on the roof of my new home, watching me. I glance at her, then put my face back in my hands. She makes her way over, cautious steps on the flimsy sheet metal, and sits next to me on the roof edge. Our legs dangle, swinging slowly in the cold autumn air. \u0027Perry?\u0027 I don\u0027t answer. She studies the side of my face. She reaches out and brushes two fingers through my shaggy hair. Her blue eyes pull on me like gravity, but I resist. I stare down at the muddy street. \u0027I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m here,\u0027 I mumble. \u0027This stupid house. With all these discards.\u0027 She doesn\u0027t respond immediately. When she does, it\u0027s quiet. \u0027They\u0027re not discards. They were loved.\u0027 \u0027For a while.\u0027 \u0027Their parents didn\u0027t leave. They were taken.\u0027 \u0027Is there a difference?\u0027 She looks at me so hard I have no choice but to meet her gaze. \u0027Your mom loved you, Perry. You\u0027ve never had to doubt that. And so did your dad.\u0027 I can\u0027t hold the weight. I give in and let it fall on me. I twist my head away from Julie as the tears come. \u0027Believe that God discarded you if you want to, fate or destiny or whatever, but at least you know they loved you.\u0027 \u0027What does it even matter,\u0027 I croak, avoiding her eyes. \u0027Who gives a shit. They\u0027re dead. That\u0027s the present. That\u0027s what matters now.\u0027 We don\u0027t speak for a few minutes. The cold breeze pricks tiny bumps on our arms. Bright leaves find their way in from the outer forests, spinning down into the Stadium\u0027s vast mouth and landing on the house\u0027s roof. \u0027You know what, Perry,\u0027 Julie says. Her voice is shaky with hurts all her own. \u0027Everything dies eventually. We all know that. People, cities, whole civilisations. Nothing lasts. So if existence was just binary, dead or alive, here or not here, what would be the fucking point in anything?\u0027 She looks up at some falling leaves and puts out her hand to catch one, a flaming red maple. \u0027My mom used to say that\u0027s why we have memory. And the opposite of memory - hope. So things that are gone can still matter. So we can build off our pasts and make futures.\u0027 She twirls the leaf in front of her face, back and forth. \u0027Mom said life only makes any sense if we can see time how God does. Past, present and future all at once.\u0027 I allow myself to look at Julie. She sees my tears and tries to wipe one away. \u0027So what\u0027s the future?\u0027 I ask, not flinching as her fingers brush my eye. \u0027I can see the past and the present, but what\u0027s the future?\u0027 \u0027Well . . .\u0027 she says with a broken laugh. \u0027I guess that\u0027s the tricky part. The past is made out of facts and history . . . I guess the future is just hope.\u0027 \u0027Or fear.\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 She shakes her head firmly and sticks the leaf in my hair. \u0027Hope.\u0027 The Stadium rises on the horizon as the Dead stumble forward. It looms above most of the surrounding buildings and consumes several city blocks, a gaudy monument to an era of excess, a world of waste and want and misguided dreams that is now profoundly over. Our cadaverous cadre has been walking for a little over a day, roaming the open roads like Kerouac beats with no gas money. The others are hungry, and there\u0027s a brief, mostly wordless debate between M and the rest before they stop at an old boarded-up town house to feed. I wait outside. It\u0027s been more days than I can remember since my last meal, but I find myself strangely content. There\u0027s a neutral feeling in my veins, balanced precisely between hungry and sated. The screams of the people in the house pierce me more sharply than in all my days of hands-on killing, and I\u0027m not even anywhere near them. I\u0027m standing far out in the street, pushing my palms into my ears and waiting for it to be over. When they emerge, M avoids my gaze. He wipes the blood off his mouth with the back of his hand and shoots me just one guilty glance before brushing past. The others are not quite there yet, not even to M\u0027s level of conscience, but there is something a little different about them, too. They take no leftovers. They dry their bloody hands on their pants. They walk in uneasy silence. It\u0027s a start. As we get close enough to the Stadium to catch the first whiffs of the Living, I go over the plan in my head. It\u0027s not much of a plan, really. It\u0027s cartoonishly simple, but here\u0027s why it might work: it\u0027s never been tried before. There has never been enough will to make a way. A few blocks from the entry gate, we stop in an abandoned house. I go into the bathroom and study myself in the mirror like the former resident must have done a thousand times. In my head I jog through the maddening repetitions of the morning routine, getting into character. Alarm-shower-clothes-breakfast. Do I look my best? Am I putting my best foot forward? Am I stepping out the door prepared for everything this world has to throw at me? I run some gel through my hair. I splash some aftershave on my face. I straighten my tie. \u0027Ready,\u0027 I tell the others. M sizes me up. \u0027Close . . . enough.\u0027 We head for the gates. Within a few blocks, the smell of the Living is nearly overpowering. It\u0027s as if the Stadium is a massive Tesla Coil crackling with storms of fragrant pink life-lightning. Everyone in our group stares at it in awe. Some of them drool freely. If they hadn\u0027t just eaten, our loosely constructed strategy would collapse in an instant. Before we get within sight of the gate, we take a side street and stop at an intersection, hiding behind a UPS truck. I step out slightly and look around the corner. Less than two blocks away, four guards stand in front of the Stadium\u0027s main entrance doors, dangling shotguns over their shoulders and chatting among themselves. Their gruff, military sentences use even fewer syllables than ours. I look at M. \u0027Thanks. For . . . doing this.\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 M says. \u0027Don\u0027t . . . die.\u0027 \u0027Trying . . . not to. Are . . . ready?\u0027 I nod. \u0027Look . . . alive . . . out there.\u0027 I smile. I brush my hair back one more time, take a deep breath, and run for it. \u0027Help!\u0027 I scream, waving my arms. \u0027Help, they\u0027re . . . right behind me!\u0027 With my best possible balance and poise, I run towards the doors. M and the other Dead lumber after me, groaning theatrically. The guards react on instinct: they raise their guns and open fire on the zombies. An arm flies off. A leg. One of the anonymous nine loses a head and goes down. But not a single weapon points in my direction. Painting Julie\u0027s face on the air in front of me, I sprint with Olympian focus. My stride is good, I can feel it, I look normal, alive, and so I snap neatly into a category: \u0027Human\u0027. Two more guards emerge with guns drawn, but they barely even look at me. They squint, they take aim at their targets, and they shout, \u0027Go! Get in there, man!\u0027 Two more zombies hit the ground behind me. As I slip in through the doors, I see M and the remaining Dead veer off and retreat. As they go, their gait suddenly changes. They lose their stumble and run like living things. Not as fast as me, not as graceful, but with purpose. The guards hesitate, the gunfire falters. \u0027What the fuck . . . ?\u0027 one of them mutters. Inside the entrance is a man with a clipboard and a notebook. An immigration officer, ready to take my name and have me fill out a stack of request forms before most likely tossing me out. The Dead have depended on this man for years to provide us with the defenceless stragglers we eat in the ruins outside. He comes towards me, flipping through his notebook, making no eye contact. \u0027Close call, eh, friend? I\u0027m going to need you to - \u0027 \u0027Ted! Look at this shit!\u0027 Ted looks up, looks through the open doors, sees his fellow soldiers standing dumbstruck. He glances at me. \u0027Wait right here.\u0027 Ted jogs out and stops next to the guards, staring at the eerily animate zombies dashing off into the distant streets like real people. I imagine the look on the men\u0027s faces, their stomachs bubbling with the queasy sensation that the earth under their feet is moving. Momentarily forgotten, I turn and run. I run through the dark entry corridor towards the light on the other end, wondering if this is a birth canal or the tunnel to Heaven. Am I coming or going? Either way, it\u0027s too late to reverse. Hidden in the gloom under a red evening sky, I step into the world of the Living.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-12.html","bookId":2434,"book":{"id":2434,"title":"Warm Bodies (Warm Bodies #1)","description":"Storyline: R is having a no-life crisis - he is a zombie.
