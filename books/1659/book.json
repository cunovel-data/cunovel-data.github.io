And in a dying world, the bonds between people are what matter most. \n In this final book in her earth-shattering Under the Never Sky trilogy, Veronica Rossi raises the stakes to their absolute limit and brings her epic love story to an unforgettable close.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/into-the-still-blue-under-the-never-sky-3.jpg","author":"Veronica Rossi","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":43,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
