Too worried. Too anxious.\\n\\n “Then I will.” Roar was quiet for a moment, thinking of a song, and then he began the Hunter’s Song.\\n\\n Perry’s favorite.\\n\\n 26\\n\\n PEREGRINE\\n\\n Perry woke to the prick of a needle in his arm.\\n\\n A Dweller in a white smock answered his question before he voiced it.\\n\\n “Medication for the pain,” she said. “They want you mobile and well enough to speak.”\\n\\n Without the fear of aches lancing through his ribs every time he breathed, a feeling of intense relief swept over him. Before the doctor had left the room, he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep, until he heard the door slide open.\\n\\n Some instinctive part of him knew it wasn’t the doctors this time. He slid off the cot, thudding to his feet as Hess and Sable entered together.\\n\\n They stopped talking as they saw him, surprised to see him up.\\n\\n “Good morning.” Sable’s gaze raked over Perry’s body in a methodical evaluation. His temper trilled with excitement, bright orange and pungent. The scent of obsession.\\n\\n Hess only glanced at Perry, then crossed his arms and stared at his own feet.\\n\\n Perry swayed unsteadily. From the corner of his eye, he could tell the bruises covering his arms and chest had darkened to deep purple.\\n\\n Guardians stood by the door with guns, stun batons, cuffs, looking ready to pounce at the slightest movement.\\n\\n He felt his mouth lift in amusement. What did they think he was going to do? Talon could have put up a better fight, but apparently he had a reputation. The Guardians looked— and scented—scared.\\n\\n “You’re on your feet,” Sable said. “I’m surprised.”\\n\\n Perry was too. Now that he’d gotten to his feet, the drugs he’d been given weren’t sitting well. Warm saliva rushed into his mouth; he was maybe five seconds from vomiting all over the floor.\\n\\n “Is your arm sore?” he asked, buying himself time. He needed his stomach to settle.\\n\\n Sable smiled. “Very.”\\n\\n Hess cleared his throat. His posture, his expression, everything about him seemed forgettable. Trivial. “We’ll be taking you to Cinder in a moment,” he said. “He’s been distressed since he woke. He’s concerned for you, as are your other friends.”\\n\\n Perry thought of Aria. If he hadn’t seen her during the night, that comment would have shaken him.\\n\\n “You can avoid their suffering—and your own—if you comply,” Hess continued. “Cinder needs to acquiesce. He needs to heal and strengthen. And he needs to agree to get us through that wall. Convince him, Peregrine, or none of us stands a chance.”\\n\\n Sable remained quiet as Hess spoke, his stance relaxed, his eyes half-open. He was humoring Hess. Letting him control this part of the proceedings.\\n\\n Now Sable’s mouth curved into a smile. “Bring him,” he said to the men at the door.\\n\\n Perry was shuttled to the room across the hall, where Cinder huddled in the corner. He looked like a newly hatched bird, folded into himself, his head bare, his eyes wide and scared.\\n\\n As soon as Perry stepped inside, Cinder scampered to his feet and darted across the room. He flung himself against Perry’s chest.\\n\\n “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry,” he said, through sobs. “I don’t know what to do. No matter what I do, you’re going to hate me.”\\n\\n “Give us a minute.” Perry turned away from Hess and Sable, shielding Cinder with his back. He wasn’t sure if he was trying to protect Cinder or hide his own shakiness. Either way, this wasn’t for them to see. “We’re not going anywhere. Just give us some space.”\\n\\n They stayed.\\n\\n “It’s all right, Cinder,” Perry said. “I’m all right.” He lowered his voice, but he knew Hess and Sable could hear everything. “Remember when you burned me?” He made a fist with his scarred and battered hand. “That was the worst pain I’ve ever felt. This doesn’t even compare.”\\n\\n “Is that supposed to make me feel better?”\\n\\n Perry smiled. “I guess not.”\\n\\n Cinder wiped at his eyes and stared at Perry’s bruises. “I don’t believe you, anyway.”\\n\\n “Heartwarming. Isn’t it, Hess?” Sable said. “I wish I could enjoy this further, but we’re going to need to keep things moving along.”\\n\\n Perry faced them, Cinder pressing close to his side. Kirra slipped into the room, standing by the Guardians at the door. She wore an expression Perry had never seen on her face. Sympathy.\\n\\n “I hope you’ve learned that I don’t make idle threats, Cinder,” Sable said. “When my rules are broken, I punish. You understand that now, don’t you?”\\n\\n Trembling against Perry, Cinder nodded.\\n\\n “Good. And you know what Peregrine wants you to do. You know he wants you to help us?”\\n\\n “I never said that,” Perry said.\\n\\n Time stopped. The look on Hess’s and Sable’s faces—and even the Guardians behind them—was worth any price Perry would need to pay.\\n\\n “I like you, Peregrine,” Sable said. “You know that. But things can become much worse for you.”\\n\\n “I’m not asking him to give his life for you.”\\n\\n “I can be very persuasive. Let’s see. In a room not far from this one, I have your best friend, and the girl you—”\\n\\n “I’ll do it!” Cinder cried out. “I’ll do what you say!” He looked up at Perry, his tears flowing again. “I didn’t know what to do. I’m sorry.”\\n\\n Perry held him close. Cinder kept saying he was sorry, when he was the one who deserved the apologies. From Perry. From Sable and Hess, and everyone. Perry wanted to tell him that, but his vocal cords felt like they’d been clamped shut.\\n\\n Sable moved to the door. He stopped there, his lips pulled in a satisfied smile. He had what he wanted. “Get the boy strong, Hess. Start him on the treatments we discussed—all of them. We move to the coast now.”\\n\\n “Not yet,” Hess protested. “We can’t attempt the crossing until the boy is ready. Even with the accelerated therapy programs, he’ll need time to recover his strength, and we can’t mobilize the Komodo in this storm. We stay here and wait for it to pass while the boy heals.”\\n\\n “This storm will never pass,” Sable said. “We’ll be in a better position on the coast. Poised to make the crossing once Cinder is ready.”\\n\\n Hess’s face turned red. “Moving this unit requires foresight. There are preparations, safety checks, dangers to be considered that surpass your understanding. Your impatience is going to ruin our chances of surviving.”\\n\\n Perry sensed the energy in the room refocus, shifting to their altercation. Kirra caught his eye. She saw it too: Hess and Sable would eventually collide. Cinder still trembled next to him.\\n\\n “We act now, or we die,” Sable said.\\n\\n “This ship is mine, Sable. I command it.”\\n\\n Sable was silent for a beat, his pale eyes sparkling. “You’re making a mistake,” he said, and then stepped outside.\\n\\n On Hess’s orders, Guardians pulled Cinder out of Perry’s arms. He struggled weakly, questions pouring out of him. “Where are you taking me? Why can’t I stay with Perry?”\\n\\n Another Guardian grabbed Perry by the arm. Perry reacted instantly, pushing him into the wall. He wrapped his hand around the Guardian’s throat, pinning him. Two men drew their guns, but Perry held on, staring into the Dweller’s terrified eyes.\\n\\n “Are you finished yet?” Hess asked.\\n\\n “No.” He was nowhere near finished, but he forced himself to release the man and step back. “It’ll be all right,” he said to Cinder. “I promise.” Then he let the Guardians lead him back to his room across the hall.\\n\\n “Wait outside,” Hess said to his men. Then he followed Perry into the room.\\n\\n The door closed, leaving them alone.\\n\\n Hess planted feet and drew his shoulders back, leveling Perry with a cold stare. “If my men hear any sign of a struggle, they will come in here and shoot you.”\\n\\n Perry slumped against the cot. “I could kill you silently if I wanted to.” His body hadn’t liked the burst of strength he’d used moments ago. His muscles quivered and chills raced up his back, nausea and fury battling inside him.\\n\\n “So violent,” Hess said, shaking his head. “Don’t think I’ve forgotten that you broke into my Pod and shattered my son’s jaw.”\\n\\n “He attacked Aria. You’re lucky that’s all I did.”\\n\\n Hess lifted his chin, defiant like Soren, but his temper brought blue flashes to the edges of Perry’s vision. Hess feared him. Perry was beaten, unarmed, barefoot, but Hess was still afraid.\\n\\n “I wouldn’t have let Sable hurt Aria,” Hess said.\\n\\n “Then you should have spoken up.”\\n\\n “You shouldn’t have made this so difficult! As a leader, you must know that the individual serves the group. The sacrifice of one man for the safety of many cannot be so different to your kind.”\\n\\n “It isn’t.”\\n\\n “Then why have you resisted?”\\n\\n Perry didn’t answer at first. He didn’t want to have this conversation with a man he didn’t respect. But he needed to say what he felt aloud—for himself. It was time to accept what he’d known for weeks.\\n\\n “I knew there’d be no chance for anyone without his ability. But I had to let him decide his own fate.” Perry could have ordered Cinder; the boy would’ve done anything he asked. But this way, Perry hoped, Cinder would feel like he’d kept some small sense of control over his own life. Cinder had been pressured, but he’d still made the choice in the end.\\n\\n Hess made a huffing sound. “You’re his leader. You should have commanded him.”\\n\\n Perry shrugged. “We see things differently.”\\n\\n “How can you pretend to be so noble? Look at you. Look at what Sable’s done to you.”\\n\\n “I don’t pretend, and these bruises are nothing compared to what Sable will get in return.”\\n\\n Saying those words, the hunger for revenge opened up inside him, terrifying and powerful. He was no different from Roar. He’d only ignored the urge. But he couldn’t anymore.\\n\\n Hess ran a hand over his face, shaking his head. “Your problem is that you want to challenge Sable forcibly. This is not a test of strength! We are not in the medieval era! It is about leverage and strategy.” He waved a hand, growing more anxious. “Look around you. I have control of everything. The Komodo. The fleet of Hovers outside. All the medicine, food, and weapons. I gave Sable some pistols and stun batons, but they are toys compared to what I have kept locked away. Medicines. Food. Communications. They are all under me. We go nowhere and do nothing unless I command it.”\\n\\n “You left people off your list,” Perry said.\\n\\n “Nonsense. They’re mine too,” Hess spat.\\n\\n “You’re sure?”\\n\\n “I have been a commander far longer than you’ve been alive, Outsider. My pilots and Guardians are highly trained. If you think Sable’s going to—” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/into-the-still-blue-under-the-never-sky-3/page-23.html","bookId":1659,"book":{"id":1659,"title":"Into the Still Blue (Under the Never Sky #3)","description":"Storyline: Into the Still Blue (Under the Never Sky #3) \\n The race to the Still Blue has reached a stalemate.
