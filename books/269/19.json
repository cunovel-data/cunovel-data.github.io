{"id":8144,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 19 A FRIENDLY RIVAL","content":"　　19On leaving the Hotel de Mussidan, M. de Breulh-Faverlay dismissed hiscarriage, for he felt as a man often does after experiencing someviolent emotion, the absolute necessity for exercise, and to be alonewith his thoughts, and by so doing recover his self-possession. Hisfriends would have been surprised if they had seen him pacinghurriedly along the Champs Elysees. The usual calm of his manner hadvanished, and the generally calm expression of his features wasentirely absent. As he walked, he talked to himself, and gesticulated. \"And this is what we call being a man of the world. We think ourselvestrue philosophers, and a look from a pair of beautiful, pleading eyesscatters all our theories to the winds.\"He had loved Sabine upon the day on which he had asked for her hand,but not so fondly as upon this day when he had learned that she couldno longer be his wife, for, from the moment he had made thisdiscovery, she seemed to him more gifted and fascinating than ever. Noone could have believed that he, the idol of society, the petteddarling of the women, and the successful rival of the men, could havebeen refused by the young girl to whom he had offered his hand. \"Yes,\" murmured he with a sigh, \"for she is just the companion forlife that I longed for. Where could I find so intelligent an intellectand so pure a mind, united with such radiant beauty, so different fromthe women of society, who live but for dress and gossip. Has Sabineanything in common with those giddy girls who look upon life as aperpetual value, and who take a husband as they do a partner, becausethey cannot dance without one? How her face lighted up as she spoke ofhim, and how thoroughly she puts faith in him! The end of it all isthat I shall die a bachelor. In my old age I will take to thepleasures of the table, for an excellent authority declares that a mancan enjoy his four meals a day with comfort. Well, that is somethingto look forward to certainly, and it will not impair my digestion ifmy heirs and expectants come and squabble round my armchair. Ah,\" headded, with a deep sigh, \"my life has been a failure.\"M. de Breulh-Faverlay was a very different type of man to that whichboth his friends and his enemies popularly supposed him to be. Uponthe death of his uncle, he had plunged into the frivolous vortex ofParisian dissipation, but of this he had soon wearied. All that he had cared for was to see the doings of his racehorsechronicled in the sporting journals, and occasionally to expend a fewthousand francs in presents of jewelry to some fashionable actress. But he had secretly longed for some more honorable manner offulfilling his duties in life, and he had determined that before hismarriage he would sell his stud and break with his old associatesentirely; and now this wished-for marriage would never take place. When he entered his club, the traces of his agitation were so visibleupon his face, that some of the card-players stopped their game toinquire if Chambertin, the favorite for the Chantilly cup, had brokendown. \"No, no,\" replied he, as he hurriedly made his way to the writing-room, \"Chambertin is as sound as a bell.\"\"What the deuce has happened to De Breulh?\" asked one of the members. \"Goodness gracious!\" remarked the man to whom the question wasaddressed, \"he seems in a hurry to write a letter.\"The gentleman was right. M. de Breulh was writing a withdrawal fromhis demand for Sabine\u0027s hand to M. de Mussidan, and he found the taskby no means an easy one, for on reading it over he found that therewas a valid strain of bitterness throughout it, which would surelyattract attention and perhaps cause embarrassing questions to be putto him. \"No,\" murmured he, \"this letter is quite unworthy of me.\" And tearingit up, he began another, in which he strung together severalconventional excuses, alleging the difficulty of breaking off hisformer habits and of an awkward entanglement which he had been unableto break with, as he had anticipated. When this little masterpiece ofdiplomacy was completed, he rang the bell, and, handing it to one ofthe club servants, told him to take it to the Count de Mussidan\u0027shouse. When this unpleasant duty was over, M. de Breulh had hoped toexperience some feeling of relief, but in this he was mistaken. Hetried cards, but rose from the table in a quarter of an hour; heordered dinner, but appetite was wanting; he went to the opera, butthen he did nothing but yawn, and the music grated on his nerves. Atlength he returned home. The day had seemed interminable, and he couldnot sleep, for Sabine\u0027s face was ever before him. Who could this manbe whom she so fondly loved and preferred before all others? Herespected her too much not to feel assured that her choice was aworthy one, but his experience had taught him that when so many men ofthe world fell into strange entanglements, a poor girl withoutknowledge of the dangers around her might easily be entrapped. \"If heis worthy of her,\" thought he, \"I will do my best to aid her; but ifnot, I will open her eyes.\"At four o\u0027clock in the morning he was still seated musing before theexpiring embers of his fire; he had made up his mind to see Andre--there was no difficulty in this, for a man of taste and wealth canfind a ready excuse for visiting the studio of a struggling artist. Hehad no fixed plan as to what he would say or do, he left all tochance, and with this decision he went to bed, and by two in theafternoon he drove straight to the Rue de la Tour d\u0027Auvergne. Andre\u0027s discreet portress was as usual leaning on her boom in thegallery as M. de Breulh\u0027s magnificent equipage drew up. \"Gracious me!\" exclaimed the worthy woman, dazzled by the gorgeousnessof the whole turnout; \"he can\u0027t be coming here, he must have mistakenthe house.\"But her amazement reach its height when M. de Breulh, on alighting,asked for Andre. \"Fourth story, first door to the right,\" answered the woman; \"but Iwill show you the way.\"\"Don\u0027t trouble yourself;\" and with these words M. de Breulh ascendedthe staircase that led to the painter\u0027s studio and knocked on thedoor. As he did so, he heard a quick, light step upon the stairs, anda young and very dark man, dressed in a weaver\u0027s blouse and carrying atin pail which he had evidently just filled with water from thecistern, came up. \"Are you M. Andre?\" asked De Breulh. \"That is my name, sir.\"\"I wish to say a few words to you.\"\"Pray come in,\" replied the young artist, opening the door of hisstudio and ushering his visitor in. Andre\u0027s voice and expression hadmade a favorable impression upon his visitor; but he was, in spite ofhis having thrown aside nearly all foolish prejudices, a littlestartled at his costume. He did not, however, allow his surprise to bevisible. \"I ought to apologize for receiving you like this,\" remarked Andrequickly, \"but a poor man must wait upon himself.\" As he spoke, hethrew off his blouse and set down the pail in a corner of the room. \"I rather should offer my excuse for my intrusion,\" returned M. deBreulh. \"I came here by the advice of one of my friends;\" he stoppedfor an instant, endeavoring to think of a name. \"By Prince Crescensi, perhaps,\" suggested Andre. \"Yes, yes,\" continued M. de Breulh, eagerly snatching at the rope theartist held out to him. \"The Prince sings your praises everywhere, andspeaks of your talents with the utmost enthusiasm. I am, on hisrecommendation, desirous of commissioning you to paint a picture forme, and I can assure you that in my gallery it will have no need to beashamed of its companions.\"Andre bowed, coloring deeply at the compliment. \"I am obliged to you,\" said he, \"and I trust that you will not bedisappointed in taking the Prince\u0027s opinion of my talent.\"\"Why should I be so?\"\"Because, for the last four months I have been so busy that I havereally nothing to show you.\"\"That is of no importance. I have every confidence in you.\"\"Then,\" returned Andre, \"all that we have to do is to choose asubject.\"Andre\u0027s manner had by this time so captivated De Breulh that hemuttered to himself, \"I really ought to hate this fellow, but on myword I like him better than any one I have met for a long time.\"Andre had by this time placed a large portfolio on the table. \"Here,\"said he, \"are some twenty or thirty sketches; if any of them took yourfancy, you could make your choice.\"\"Let me see them,\" returned De Breulh politely, for having made anestimate of the young man\u0027s character, he now wished to see what hisartistic talents were like. With this object in view he examined allthe sketches in the portfolio minutely, and then turned to those onthe walls. Andre said nothing, but he somehow felt that this visitwould prove the turning-point of his misfortunes. But for all that theyoung man\u0027s heart was very sad, for it was two days since Sabine hadleft him, promising to write to him the next morning regarding M. deBreulh-Faverlay, but as yet he had received no communication, and hewas on the tenterhooks of expectation, not because he had any doubt ofSabine, but for the reason that he had no means of obtaining anyinformation of what went on in the interior of the Hotel de Mussidan. M. de Breulh had now finished his survey, and had come to theconclusion that though many of Andre\u0027s productions were crude andlacking in finish, yet that he had the true artistic metal in him. Heextended his hand to the young man and said forcibly, \"I am no longerinfluenced by the opinion of a friend. I have seen and judged formyself, and am more desirous than ever of possessing one of yourpictures. I have made my choice of a subject, and now let us discussthe details.\"As he spoke he handed a little sketch to Andre. It was a view ofeveryday life, which the painter had entitled, \"Outside the Barrier.\"Two men with torn garments and wine-flushed faces were struggling intipsy combat, while on the right hand side of the picture lay a woman,bleeding profusely from a cut on the forehead, and two of herterrified companions were bending over her, endeavoring to restore herto consciousness. In the background were some flying figures, who werehastening up to separate the combatants. The sketch was one of reallife, denuded of any sham element of romance, and this was the onethat M. de Breulh had chosen. The two men discussed the size of thepicture, and not a single detail was omitted. \"I am sure that you will do all that is right,\" remarked De Breulh. \"Let your own inspiration guide you, and all will be well.\" In realityhe was dying to get away, for he felt in what a false position he was,and with a violent effort he approached the money part of the matter. \"Monsieur,\" said Andre, \"it is impossible to fix a price; whencompleted, a picture may only be worth the canvas that it is paintedon, or else beyond all price. Let us wait.\"\"Well,\" broke in M. de Breulh, \"what do you say to ten thousandfrancs?\"\"Too much,\" returned Andre with a deprecatory wave of his hand; \"fartoo much. If I succeed in it, as I hope to do, I will ask six thousandfrancs for it.\"\"Agreed!\" answered De Breulh, taking from his pocket an elegant note-case with his crest and monogram upon it and extracting from it threethousand francs. \"I will, as is usual, deposit half the price inadvance.\"Andre blushed scarlet. \"You are joking,\" said he. \"Not at all,\" answered De Breulh quietly; \"I have my own way of doingbusiness, from which I never deviate.\"In spite of this answer Andre\u0027s pride was hurt. \"But,\" remarked he, \"this picture will not be ready for perhaps six orseven months. I have entered into a contract with a wealthy builder,named Candele, to execute the outside decorations of his house.\"\"Never mind that,\" answered M. de Breulh; \"take as long as you like.\"Of course, after this, Andre could offer no further opposition; hetherefore took the money without another word. \"And now,\" said De Breulh, as he paused for a moment at the opendoorway, \"let me wish you my good luck, and if you will come andbreakfast with me one day, I think I can show you some pictures whichyou will really appreciate.\" And handing his card to the artist, hewent downstairs. At first Andre did not glance at the card, but when he did so, theletters seemed to sear his eyeballs like a red-hot iron. For a momenthe could hardly breathe, and then a feeling of intense anger tookpossession of him, for he felt that he had been trifled with anddeceived. Hardly knowing what he was doing, he rushed out on the landing, and,leaning over the banister, called out loudly, \"Sir, stop a moment!\"De Breulh, who had by this time reached the bottom of the staircase,turned round. \"Come back, if you please,\" said Andre. After a moment\u0027s hesitation, De Breulh obeyed; and when he was againin the studio, Andre addressed him in a voice that quivered withindignation. \"Take back these notes, sir; I will not accept them.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"Only that I have thought the matter over, and that I will not acceptyour commission.\"\"And why this sudden change?\"\"You know perfectly well, M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"The gentleman at once saw that Sabine had mentioned his name to theyoung artist, and with a slight lacking of generous feeling said,--\"Let me hear your reasons, sir.\"\"Because, because----\" stammered the young man. \"Because is not answer.\"Andre\u0027s confusion became greater. He would not tell the whole truth,for he would have died sooner than bring Sabine\u0027s name into thediscussion; and he could only see one way out of his difficulty. \"Suppose I say that I do not like your manner or appearance,\" returnedhe disdainfully. \"Is it your wish to insult me, M. Andre?\"\"As you choose to take it.\"M. de Breulh was not gifted with an immense stock of patience. Heturned livid, and made a step forward; but his generous impulsesrestrained him, and it was in a voice broken by agitation that hesaid,--\"Accept my apologies, M. Andre; I fear that I have played a partunworthy of you and of myself. I ought to have given you my name atonce. I know everything.\"\"I do not comprehend you,\" answered Andre in a glacial voice. \"Why doubt, then, if you do not understand? However, I have given youcause to do so. But, let me reassure you, Mademoiselle Sabine hasspoken to me with the utmost frankness; and, if you still distrust me,let me tell you that this veiled picture is her portrait. I will saymore,\" continued De Breulh gravely, as the artist still kept silent;\"yesterday, at Mademoiselle de Mussidan\u0027s request, I withdrew from myposition as a suitor for her hand.\"Andre had already been touched by De Breulh\u0027s frank and open manner,and these last words entirely conquered him. \"I can never thank you enough,\" began he. But De Breulh interrupted him. \"A man should not be thanked for performing his duty. I should lie toyou if I said that I am not painfully surprised at her communication;but tell me, had you been in my place, would you not have acted in thesame manner?\"\"I think that I should.\"\"And now we are friends, are we not?\" and again De Breulh held out hishand, which Andre clasped with enthusiasm. \"Yes, yes,\" faltered he. \"And now,\" continued De Breulh, with a forced smile, \"let us say nomore about the picture, which was, after all, merely a pretext. As Icame here I said to myself, \u0027If the man to whom Mademoiselle deMussidan has given her heart is worthy of her, I will do all I can toadvance his suit with her family!\u0027 I came here to see what you werelike; and now I say to you, do me a great honor, and permit me toplace myself, my fortune, and the influence of my friends, at yourdisposal.\"The offer was made in perfect good faith, but Andre shook his head. \"I shall never forget your kindness in making this offer, but----\"; hepaused for a moment, and then went on: \"I will be as open as you havebeen, and will tell you the whole truth. You may think me foolish; butremember, though I am poor, I have still my self-respect to maintain. I love Sabine, and would give my life for her. Do not be offended atwhat I am about to say. I would, however, sooner give up her hand thanbe indebted for it to you.\"\"But this is mere madness.\"\"No, sir, it is the purest wisdom; for were I to accede to yourwishes, I should feel deeply humiliated by the thought of your self-denial; for I should be madly jealous of the part you were playing. You are of high birth and princely fortune, while I am utterlyfriendless and unknown; all that I am deficient in you possess.\"\"But I have been poor myself,\" interposed De Breulh, \"and perhapsendured even greater miseries than ever you have done. Do you knowwhat I was doing at your age? I was slowly starving to death atSonora, and had to take the humblest position in a cattle ranch. Doyou think that those days taught me nothing?\"\"You will be able to judge me all the more clearly then,\" returnedAndre. \"If I raise myself up to Sabine\u0027s level, as she begged me to,then I shall feel that I am your equal; but if I accept your aid, I amyour dependent; and I will obey her wishes or perish in the effort.\"Up to this moment the passion which stirred Andre\u0027s inmost soul hadbreathed in every word he uttered; but, checking himself by a mightyeffort, he resumed in a tone of greater calmness,--\"But I ought to remember how much we already owe you, and I hope thatyou will allow me to call myself your friend?\"M. de Breulh\u0027s noble nature enabled him to understand Andre\u0027sscruples; his feelings, however, would not for the instant enable himto speak. He slowly put the notes back in their receptacle, and thensaid in a low voice,--\"Your conduct is that of an honorable man; and remember this, at alltimes and seasons you may rely upon De Breulh-Faverlay. Farewell!\"As soon as he was alone, Andre threw himself into an armchair, andmused over this unexpected interview, which had proved a source ofsuch solace to his feelings. All that he now longed for was a letterfrom Sabine. At this moment the portress entered with a letter. Andrewas so occupied with his thoughts that he hardly noticed this act ofcondescension on the part of the worthy woman. \"A letter!\" exclaimed he; and, tearing it open, he glanced at thesignature. But Sabine\u0027s name was not there; it was signed Modeste. What could Sabine\u0027s maid have to say to him? He felt that some greatmisfortune was impending, and, trembling with excitement, he read theletter. \"SIR,--\"I write to tell you that my mistress has succeeded in the mattershe spoke of to you; but I am sorry to say that I have bad news togive you, for she is seriously ill.\"\"Ill!\" exclaimed Andre, crushing up the letter in his hands, anddashing it upon the floor. \"Ill! ill!\" he repeated, not heeding thepresence of the portress; \"why, she may be dead;\" and, snatching uphis hat, he dashed downstairs into the street. As soon as the portress was left alone, she picked up the letter,smoothed it out, and read it. \"And so,\" murmured she, \"the little lady\u0027s name was Sabine--a prettyname; and she is ill, is she? I expect that the old gent who calledthis morning, and asked so many questions about M. Andre, would give agood deal for this note; but no, that would not be fair.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/935/28344.html","bookId":269,"book":{"id":269,"title":"Caught In The Net 落网","description":"简介： Emile Gaboriau (1833-1873) is an important figure in the history of detective fiction.
