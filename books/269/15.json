{"id":8140,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15 MASTER CHUPIN.","content":"　　15Beaumarchef, when Mascarin called a general meeting of his associates,was in the habit of assuming his very best attire; for as he was oftencalled into the inner office to answer questions, he was muchimpressed with the importance of the occasion. This time, however, thesubordinate, although he had received due notice of the meeting, wasstill in his every-day dress. This discomposed him a good deal, thoughhe kept muttering to himself that he meant no disrespect by it. Earlyin the morning he had been compelled to make up the accounts of twocooks, who, having obtained situations, were leaving the servants\u0027 \n \n lodging-house. When this matter was completed, he had hoped for halfan hour\u0027s leisure. As he was crossing the courtyard, however, he fellin with Toto Chupin bringing in his daily report, which Beaumarchefthought would be what it usually was--a mere matter of form. He was,however, much mistaken; for though outwardly Toto was the same, yethis ideas had taken an entirely new direction; and when Beaumarchefurged him to look sharp, the request was received with a great deal ofsullenness. \n \n \"I ain\u0027t lost no time,\" said he, \"and have fished up a thing or twofresh; but before saying a word--\"He stopped, and seemed a little confused. \n \n \"Well, go on.\"\"I want a fresh arrangement.\"Beaumarchef was staggered. \n \n \"Arrangement!\" he echoed. \n \n \"Of course you can lump it if yer don\u0027t like it,\" said the boy. \"Doyou think as how I\u0027m going to work like a horse, and not get a wink ofsleep, just for a \u0027thank ye, Chupin?\u0027 No fear. I\u0027m worth a sight morenor that.\"Beaumarchef flew into a rage. \n \n \"Then you are not worth a pinch of salt,\" said he. \n \n \"All right, my cove.\"\"And you are an ungrateful young villain to talk like this after allthe kindness your master has shown you.\"Chupin gave a sarcastic laugh. \n \n \"Goodness!\" cried he. \"To hear you go on, one would think that theboss had ruined himself for my sake.\"\"He took you out of the streets, and has given you a room ever since.\"\"A room, do you say? I call it a dog kennel.\"\"You have your breakfast and dinner every day regularly.\"\"I know that, and half a bottle of wine at each meal, which has somuch water in it that it cannot even stain the tablecloth.\"\"You are an ungrateful young hound,\" exclaimed Beaumarchef, \"andforget that, in addition to this, he has set you up in business as ahot chestnut seller.\"\"Good old business! I am allowed to stand all day under the gateway,roasted on one side, and frozen on the other, and gain, perhaps twentysous.\"\"You know that in summer he has promised to set you up in the friedpotato line.\"\"Thank ye for nothing; I don\u0027t like the smell of grease.\"\"What is it you want, then?\"\"Nothing. I feels that I ought to be a gentleman at large.\"Beaumarchef cast a furious glance at the shameless youth, and told himthat he would report everything to his master. The boy, however, didnot seem to care a pin. \n \n \"I intends to see Master Mascarin myself presently,\" remarked Chupin. \n \n \"You are an idiot.\"\"Why so? Do you think I didn\u0027t live better before I had anything to dowith this blooming old cove? I never worked then. I used to sing infront of the pubs, and easily made my three francs a day. My pal and Isoon check \u0027em though, and then off we went to the theatre. Sometimeswe\u0027d make tracks for Ivry, and take our doss in a deserted factory,into which the crushers never put their noses. In the winter we usedto go to the glass houses and sleep in the warm ashes. All these weregood times, while now--\"\"Well, what have you to grumble at now? Don\u0027t I hand you a five-francpiece every day that you are at work?\"\"But that ain\u0027t good enough. Come, don\u0027t get shirty; all I asks is arise of salary. Only say either Yes or No; and if you say No, why, Isends in my resignation.\"Beaumarchef would have given a five-franc piece out of his own pocketfor Mascarin to have heard the boy\u0027s impertinence. \n \n \"You are a young rascal!\" said he, \"and keep the worst of company. \n \n There is no use in denying it, for a hang-dog fellow, calling himselfPolyte, has been here asking after you.\"\"My company ain\u0027t any business of yours.\"\"Well, I give you warning, you will come to grief.\"\"How?\" returned Toto Chupin sulkily. \"How can I come to grief? If oldMascarin interferes, I\u0027ll shut up his mouth pretty sharp. I wish youand your master wouldn\u0027t poke their noses into my affairs. I\u0027m sick ofyou both. Don\u0027t you think I\u0027m up to you? When you make me follow someone for a week at a time, it isn\u0027t to do \u0027em a kindness, I reckon. Ifthings turn out badly, I\u0027ve only to go before a beak and speak up; Ishould get off easily enough then; and if I do so, you will be sorryfor not having given me more than my five francs a day.\"Beaumarchef was an old soldier and a bold man, but he was easilyupset, for the lad\u0027s insolence made him believe that he was utteringwords that had been put in his mouth by some wily adviser; and notknowing how to act, the ex-soldier thought it best to adopt a moreconciliating demeanor. \n \n \"How much do you want?\" asked he. \n \n \"Well, seven francs to start with.\"\"The deuce you do! Seven francs a day is a sum. Well, I\u0027ll give it youmyself to-day and will speak about you to the master.\"\"You won\u0027t get me to loosen my tongue for that amount to-day; you maybet your boots on that,\" answered the lad insolently. \"I wants onehundred francs down on the nail.\"\"One hundred francs,\" echoed Beaumarchef, scandalized at such ademand. \n \n \"Yes, my cove, that and no less.\"\"And what will you give in return? No, no, my lad; your demand is apreposterous one; besides, you wouldn\u0027t know how to spend such a sum.\"\"Don\u0027t you flurry yourself about that; but of one thing you may besure, I sha\u0027n\u0027t spend my wages as you do--in wax for your mustache.\"Beaumarchef could not endure an insult to his mustache, and Chupin wasabout to receive the kick he had so richly earned, when Daddy Tantainesuddenly made his appearance, looking exactly as he did when hevisited Paul in his garret. \n \n \"Tut, tut; never quarrel with the door open.\"Beaumarchef thanked Providence for sending this sudden reinforcementto his aid, and began in a tone of indignation,--\"Toto Chupin--\"\"Stop! I have heard every word,\" broke in Tantaine. \n \n On hearing this, Toto felt that he had better make himself scarce; forthough he hardly knew Mascarin, and utterly despised Beaumarchef, hetrembled before the oily Tantaine, for in him he recognized a beingwho would stand no nonsense. He therefore began in an apologetictone,--\"Just let me speak, sir; I only wanted--\"\"Money, of course, and very natural too. Come, Beaumarchef, hand thisworthy lad the hundred francs that he has so politely asked for.\"Beaumarchef was utterly stupefied, and was about to make someobjection when he was struck by a signal which Toto did not perceive,and, drawing out his pocketbook, extracted a note which he offered tothe lad. Toto glanced at the note, then at the faces of the two men,but was evidently afraid to take the money. \n \n \"Take the money,\" said Tantaine. \"If your information is not worth themoney, I will have it back from you; come into the office, where weshall not be disturbed.\"Tantaine took a chair, and glancing at Toto, who stood before himtwirling his cap leisurely, said,--\"I heard you.\"The lad had by this time recovered his customary audacity. \n \n \"Five days ago,\" he began, \"I was put on to Caroline Schimmel; I havefound out all about her by this time. She is as regular as clockworkin her duties at least. She wakes at ten and takes her absinthe. Thenshe goes to a little restaurant she knows, and has her breakfast and agame at cards with any one that will play with her. At six in theevening she goes to the Grand Turk, a restaurant and dancing-shop inthe Rue des Poisonnieres. Ain\u0027t it a swell ken just! You can eat;drink, dance, or sing, just as you like; but you must have decent togson, or they won\u0027t let you in.\"\"Wouldn\u0027t they let you through then?\"Toto pointed significantly to his rags as he replied,--\"This rig out wouldn\u0027t pass muster, but I have a scheme in hand.\"Tantaine took down the address of the dancing-saloon, and then,addressing Toto with the utmost severity,--\"Do you think,\" said he, \"that this report is worth a hundred francs?\"Toto made a quaint grimace. \n \n \"Do you think,\" asked he, \"that Caroline can lead the life she doeswithout money? No fear. Well, I have found out where the coin comesfrom.\"The dim light in the office enabled Tantaine to hide the pleasure hefelt on hearing these words. \n \n \"Ah,\" answered he carelessly, as if it was a matter of but littlemoment, \"and so you have found out all that, have you? \n \n \"Yes, and a heap besides. Just you listen. After her breakfast, mysweet Carry began to play cards with some chaps who had been grubbingat the next table. \u0027Regular right down card sharpers and macemen,\u0027 \n \n said I to myself, as I watched the way in which they faked thepasteboards. \u0027They\u0027ll get everything out of you, old gal.\u0027 I was inthe right, for in less than an hour she had to go up to the counterand leave one of her rings as security for the breakfast. He said heknew her, and would give her credit. \u0027You are a trump,\u0027 said she. \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll just trot off to my own crib and get the money.\u0027 \"\"Did she go home?\"\"Not she; she went to a real swell house in a bang up part of Paris,the Rue de Varennes. She knocked at the door, and in she went, while Ilounged about outside.\"\"Do you know who lives there?\"\"Of course I do. The grocer round the corner told me that it wasinhabited by the Duke--what was his blessed name? Oh, the Duke----\"\"Was it the Duke de Champdoce?\"\"That is the right one, a chap they say as has his cellars chock fullof gold and silver.\"\"You are rather slow, my lad,\" said Tantaine, with his assumed air ofindifference. \"Get on a bit, do.\"Toto was much put out; for he had expected that his intelligence wouldhave created an immense sensation. \n \n \"Give a cove time to breathe in. Well, in half an hour out comes myCarry as lively as a flea. She got into a passing cab and away shewent. Fortunately I can run a bit, and reached the Palais Royal intime to see Caroline change two notes of two hundred francs each atthe money-changers.\"\"How did you find out that?\"\"By looking at \u0027em. The paper was yellow.\"Tantaine smiled kindly. \"You know a banknote then?\"\"Yes, but I have precious few chances of handling them. Once I wentinto a money-changer\u0027s shop and asked them just to let me feel one,and they said, \u0027Get out sharp.\u0027 \"\"Is that all?\" demanded Tantaine. \n \n \"No; I have kept the best bit for a finish. I want to tell you thatthere are others on the lookout after Caroline.\"Toto had no reason this time to grumble at the effect he had produced,for the old man gave such a jump that his hat fell off. \n \n \"What are you saying?\" said he. \n \n \"Simply that for the last three days a big chap with a harp on hisback has been keeping her in view. I twigged him at once, and he toosaw her go into the swell crib that you say belongs to that Duke.\"Tantaine pondered a little. \n \n \"A street musician,\" muttered he. \"I must find out all about this. \n \n Now, Toto, listen to me; chuck Caroline over, and stick to the fellowwith the harp; be off with you, for you have earned your money well.\"As Chupin went off, the old man shook his head. \n \n \"Too sharp by a good bit,\" said he; \"he won\u0027t have a long lease oflife.\"Beaumarchef was about to ask Tantaine to remain in the office while hewent off to put on his best clothes, but the old man stopped thisrequest by saying,--\"As M. Mascarin does not like to be disturbed, I will just go inwithout knocking. When the other gentlemen arrive, show them in; forlook you here, my good friend, the pear is so ripe that if it is notplucked, it will fall to the ground.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/935/28340.html","bookId":269,"book":{"id":269,"title":"Caught In The Net 落网","description":"简介： Emile Gaboriau (1833-1873) is an important figure in the history of detective fiction.
