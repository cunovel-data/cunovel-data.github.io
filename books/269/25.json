{"id":8150,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 25 A NEW SKIN.","content":"　　25Dr. Hortebise\u0027s private arrangements were sadly upset by his beingcompelled to accede to the desire of Tantaine and Mascarin, and ingranting hospitality to Paul Violaine; and in spite of the brilliantvisions of the future, he often devoutly wished that Mascarin and hisyoung friend were at the other side of the world; but for all that henever thought of attempting to evade the order he had received. Hetherefore set himself steadily to his task, endeavoring to form Paul\u0027smind, blunt his conscience, and prepare him for the inevitable partthat he would soon have to play. \n \n Paul found in him a most affable companion, pleasant, witty, andgifted with great conversational powers. Five days were thus spentbreakfasting at well-known restaurants, driving in the Bois, anddining at clubs of which the doctor was a member, while the eveningswere passed at the banker\u0027s. The doctor played cards with his host,while Paul and Flavia conversed together in low whispers, or else hungover the piano together. But every kind of agreeable existence comesto an end, and one day Daddy Tantaine entered the room, his faceradiant with delight. \n \n \"I have secured you the sweetest little nest in the world,\" cried hemerrily. \"It is not so fine as this, but more in accordance with yourposition.\"\"Where is it?\" asked Paul. \n \n Tantaine waited. \"You won\u0027t wear out much shoe leather,\" said he, \"inwalking to a certain banker\u0027s, for your lodgings are close to hishouse.\"That Tantaine had a splendid talent for arrangement Paul realized assoon as he entered his new place of abode, which was in the RueMontmartre, and consisted of some neat, quiet rooms, just such as anartist who had conquered his first difficulties would inhabit. Theapartments were on the third floor, and comprised a tiny entrancehall, sitting-room, bed and dressing room. A piano stood near thewindow in the sitting-room. The furniture and curtains were tastefuland in good order, but nothing was new. One thing surprised Paul verymuch; he had been told that the apartments had been taken andfurnished three days ago, and yet it seemed as if they had beeninhabited for years, and that the owner had merely stepped out a fewminutes before. The unmade bed, and the half-burnt candles in thesleeping-room added to this impression, while on the rug lay a pair ofworn slippers. The fire had not gone out entirely, and a half-smokedcigar lay on the mantelpiece. \n \n On the table in the sitting-room was a sheet of music paper, with afew bars jotted down upon it. Paul felt so convinced that he was inanother person\u0027s rooms, that he could not help exclaiming, \"But surelysome one has been living in these chambers.\"\"We are in your own home, my dear boy,\" said Tantaine. \n \n \"But you took over everything, I suppose, and the original proprietorsimply walked out?\"Tantaine smiled, as though an unequivocal compliment had been paidhim. \n \n \"Why, do you not know your own home?\" asked he; \"you have been livinghere for the last twelve months.\"\"I can\u0027t understand you,\" answered Paul, opening his eyes inastonishment; \"you must be jesting.\"\"I am entirely in earnest; for more than a year you have beenestablished here. If you want a proof of the correctness of myassertion, call up the porter.\" He ran to the head of the staircaseand called out, \"Come up, Mother Brigaut.\"In a few moments a stout old woman came panting into the room. \n \n \"And how are you, Mother Brigaut?\" said Tantaine gayly. \"I have a wordor two to say to you. You know that gentleman, do you not?\"\"What a question? as if I did not know one of the gentlemen lodginghere?\"\"What is his name?\"\"M. Paul.\"\"What, plain M. Paul, and nothing else?\"\"Well, sir, it is not his fault if he did not know his father ormother.\"\"What does he do?\"\"He is a musician; he gives lessons on the piano, and composes music.\"\"Does he do a good business?\"\"I can\u0027t say, sir, but I should guess about two or three hundredfrancs a month; and he makes that do, for he is economical and quiet,and as modest as a young girl.\"Tantaine\u0027s face shone all over with satisfaction. \n \n \"You must have known M. Paul for some time, as you seem so thoroughlyacquainted with his habits?\" said he. \n \n \"Well, I ought to, for he has been here nearly fifteen months, and allthat time I have looked after his room.\"\"Do you know where he lived before he came here?\"\"Of course I do, for I went to inquire about him in the Rue Jacob. Thepeople there were quite cut up at his leaving, but you see this wasmore handy for the music publisher in the Rue Richelieu, for whom heworks.\"\"Good, Mother Brigaut; that will do; you can leave us now.\"As Paul listened to this brief conversation, he wondered if he wasawake or asleep. Tantaine stood at the door and watched the woman downstairs; then he closed it carefully, and coming up to Paul, said,--\"Well, what do you think of all this?\"At first Paul was so astounded that he could hardly find words inwhich to express himself; but he remembered the words that Dr. \n \n Hortebise had so often dinned into his ears during the last fivedays,--\"Let nothing astonish you.\"\"I suppose,\" said he at last, \"that you had taught this old woman herlesson beforehand.\"\"Merciful powers!\" exclaimed Tantaine in tones of extreme disgust. \"Ifthese are all the ideas you have gained from what you have heard, ourtask will not be by any means an easy one.\"Paul was wounded by Tantaine\u0027s contemptuous manner. \n \n \"I understand well enough, sir,\" answered he sulkily, \"that this ismerely a prologue to a romantic drama.\"\"You are right, my lad,\" cried he, in a more satisfied voice; \"and itis one that is quite indispensable. The plot of the drama will berevealed to you later on, and also the reward you will receive if youplay your part well.\"\"But why cannot you tell me everything now?\"Tantaine shook his head. \n \n \"Have patience, you rash boy!\" said he. \"Rome was not built in a day. \n \n Be guided by me, and follow blindly the orders of those interested inyou. This is your first lesson; think it over seriously.\"\"My first lesson! What do you mean?\"\"Call it a rehearsal if you like. All that the good woman told you,\"continued Tantaine, \"you must look upon as true; nay, it is true, andwhen you believe this thoroughly, you are quite prepared for the fray,but until then you must remain quiescent. Remember this, you cannotimpress others unless you firmly believe yourself. The greatestimpostors of all ages have ever been their own dupes.\"At the word impostor, Paul seemed about to speak, but a wave ofTantaine\u0027s hand silenced him. \n \n \"You must cast aside your old skin, and enter that of another. PaulViolaine, the natural son of a woman who kept a small drapery shop atPoitiers, Paul Violaine, the youthful lover of Rose, no longer exists. \n \n He died of cold and hunger in a garret in the Hotel de Perou, as M. deLoupins will testify when necessary.\"The tone in which Tantaine spoke showed his intense earnestness, andwith emphatic gestures he drove each successive idea into Paul\u0027sbrain. \n \n \"You will rid yourself of your former recollections as you do of anold coat, which you throw aside, and forget the very existence of. Andnot only that, but you must lose your memory, and that so entirely,that if any one in the street calls out Violaine, you will never evendream of turning round.\"Paul\u0027s brain seemed to tremble beneath the crime that his companionwas teaching him. \n \n \"Who am I then?\" asked he. \n \n A sardonic smile crossed Tantaine\u0027s face. \n \n \"You are just what the portress told you, Paul, and nothing more. Yourfirst recollections are of a Foundling Hospital, and you never knewyour parents. You have lived here fifteen months, and before that youresided in the Rue Jacob. The portress knows no more; but if you willcome with me to the Rue Jacob, the people there can tell you moreabout your life when you were a lodger in the house. Perhaps, if youare careful, we may take you back to your more childish days, and evenfind you a father.\"\"But,\" said Paul, \"I might be questioned regarding my past life: whatthen? M. Rigal or Mademoiselle Flavia might interrogate me at anymoment?\"\"I see; but do not disquiet yourself. You will be furnished with allnecessary papers, so that you can account for all your life during thetwenty-five years you spent in this world.\"\"Then I presume that the person into whose shoes I have crept was acomposer and a musician like myself?\"Again Tantaine\u0027s patience gave way, and it was with an oath that heexclaimed,--\"Are you acting the part of a fool, or are you one in reality? No onehas ever been here except you. Did you not hear what the old womansaid? She told you that you are a musician, a self-made one, and whilewaiting until your talents are appreciated, you give lessons inmusic.\"\"And to whom do I /give/ them?\"Tantaine took three visiting cards from a china ornament on themantelshelf. \n \n \"Here are three pupils of yours,\" said he, \"who can pay you onehundred francs per month for two lessons a week, and two of them willassure you that you have taught them for some time. The third, MadameGrandorge, a widow, will vow that she owes all her success, which isvery great, to your lessons. You will go and give these pupils theirlessons at the hours noted on their cards, and you will be received asif you had often been to the house before; and remember to beperfectly at your ease.\"\"I will do my best to follow your instructions.\"\"One last piece of information. In addition to your lessons, you arein the habit of copying for certain wealthy amateurs the fragments ofold and almost obsolete operas, and on the piano lies the work thatyou are engaged on for the Marquis de Croisenois, a charmingcomposition by Valserra. You see,\" continued Tantaine, taking Paul bythe arm, and showing him round the room, \"that nothing has beenforgotten, and that you have lived here for years past. You havealways been a steady young man, and have saved up a little money. Inthis drawer you will find eight certificates of scrip from the Bank ofFrance.\"Paul would have put many more questions, but the visitor was alreadyon the threshold, and only paused to add these words,--\"I will call here to-morrow with Dr. Hortebise.\" Then, with a strangesmile playing on his lips, he added, as Mascarin had before, \"You willbe a duke yet.\"The old portress was waiting for Tantaine, and as soon as she saw himcoming down the stairs immersed in deep thought, out she ran towardhim with as much alacrity as her corpulency would admit. \n \n \"Did I do it all right?\" asked she. \n \n \"Hush!\" answered he, pushing her quickly into her lodge, the door ofwhich stood open. \"Hush! are you mad or drunk, to talk like this, whenyou do not know who is listening?\"\"I hope you were pleased with my success,\" continued the woman, aghastat his sudden anger. \n \n \"You did well--very well; you piled up the evidence perfectly. I shallhave an excellent report to make of you to M. Mascarin.\"\"I am so glad; and now my husband and I are quite safe?\"The old man shook his head with an air of doubt. \n \n \"Well, I can hardly say that yet; the master\u0027s arm is long and strong;but you have numerous enemies. All the servants in the house hate you,and would be glad to see you come to grief.\"\"Is that really so, sir? How can that be, for both I and my husbandhave been very kind to all of them?\"\"Yes, perhaps you have been lately, but how about the times before? \n \n You and your husband both acted very foolishly. Article 386 cannot begot now, and two women can swear that they saw you and your husband,with a bunch of keys in your hand, on the second floor.\"The fat woman\u0027s face turned a sickly yellow, she clasped her hands,and whined in tones of piteous entreaty,--\"Don\u0027t speak so loud, sir, I beg of you.\"\"You made a terrible mistake in not coming to my master earlier, forthere had been then so much talk that the matter had reached the earsof the police.\"\"But for all that, if M. Mascarin pleased----\"\"He does please, my good woman, and is quite willing to serve you. Iam sure that he will manage to break the inquiry; or if it must go on,he has several witnesses who will depose in your favor; but, you know,he gives nothing for nothing, and must have implicit obedience.\"\"Good, kind man that he is, my husband and I would go through fire andwater for him, while my daughter, Euphenice, would do anything in theworld for him.\"Tantaine recoiled uneasily, for the old woman\u0027s gratitude was sodemonstrative that he feared she was about to embrace him. \n \n \"All you have to do is to stick firmly to what you have said aboutPaul,\" continued he, when he found himself at a safe distance; \"and ifever you breathe a word of what you have been doing, he will hand youover to the law, and then take care of Article 386.\"It was evident that this portion of the Code, that had reference tothe robbery of masters by servants, struck terror into the woman\u0027ssoul. \n \n \"If I stood on the scaffold,\" said she, \"I would tell the story aboutM. Paul exactly as I have been taught.\"Her tone was so sincere, that Tantaine addressed her in a kindliervoice. \n \n \"Stick to that,\" said he, \"and I can say to you, \u0027Hope.\u0027 Upon the dayon which the young man\u0027s business is settled you will get a paper fromme, which will prove your complete innocence, and enable you to say,\u0027I have been grossly maligned.\u0027 \"\"May the dear young man\u0027s business be settled sharp,\" said she. \n \n \"It will not be long before it is so; but, remember, in the meantimeyou must keep an eye upon him.\"\"I will do so.\"\"And, remember, report to me whoever comes to see him, no matter whoit may be.\"\"Not a soul can go upstairs without my seeing or hearing him.\"\"Well, if any one, save the master, Dr. Hortebise, or myself comes, donot lose a moment, but come and report.\"\"You shall know in five minutes.\"\"I wonder if that is all I have to say?\" mused Tantaine. \"Ah! Iremember: note exactly the hour at which this young man comes andgoes. Do not have any conversation with him; answer all questions headdresses you with a simple \u0027Yes,\u0027 or \u0027No,\u0027 and, as I said before,watch his every movement.\"And Tantaine turned to go away, paying no attention to the woman\u0027seager protestations. \n \n \"Keep a strict watch,\" were his last words, \"and, above all, see thatthe lad gets into no scrape.\"In Tantaine\u0027s presence Paul had endeavored to assume an air ofbravado, but as soon as he was left alone he was seized with suchmortal terror, that he sank in a half fainting condition into an easy-chair. He felt that he was not going to put on a disguise for a briefperiod, but for life, and that now, though he rose in life, wealth,title, even a wife would all have been obtained by a shameful andskilfully planned deception, and this deception he must keep up untilthe day of his death. He shuddered as he recalled Tantaine\u0027s words,\"Paul Violaine is dead.\" He recalled the incidents in the life of theescaped galley-slave Coignard, who, under the name of Pontis de St. \n \n Helene, absolutely assumed the rank of a general officer, and tookcommand of a domain. Coignard was recognized and betrayed by an oldfellow-prisoner, and this was exactly the risk that Paul knew he mustrun, for any of his old companions might recognize and denounce him. \n \n Had he on such an occasion sufficient presence of mind to turnlaughingly to his accuser, and say, \"Really, my good fellow, you arein error, for I never set eyes on you before?\"He felt that he could not do it, and had he any means of existence, hewould have solved the difficulty by taking to flight. But he knew thatmen like Mascarin, Hortebise, and Tantaine were not easily eluded, andhis heart sank within him as he remembered the various crumbs ofinformation that each of these men had dropped before him. To agree totheir sordid proposals, and to remain in the position in which he was,was certainly to incur a risk, but it was one that was a long way off,and might never eventually come to pass; while to change his mindwould be as sure to bring down swift and condign punishment upon hishead; and the weak young man naturally chose the more remotecontingency, and with this determination the last qualms of hisconscience expired. \n \n The first night he slept badly in his new abode, for it seemed to himas if the spectre of the man whose place he was to usurp was hoveringover his couch. But with the dawn of day, and especially when the hourarrived for him to go out and give his lessons, he felt his couragereturn to him, though rashness perhaps would be the more correct word. \n \n And with a mien of perfect confidence he repaired to the house ofMademoiselle Grandorge, the oldest of his pupils. Impelled by the samefeeling of curiosity as to how Paul would comport himself, both Dr. \n \n Hortebise and Father Tantaine had been hanging about the RueMontmartre, and taking advantage of a heavy dray that was passing,caught a good glimpse of the young man. \n \n \"Aha,\" chuckled Tantaine, delighted at seeing Paul look so brisk andjoyous, \"our young cock is in full feather; last night he wasdecidedly rather nervous.\"\"Yes,\" answered the doctor, \"he is on the right road, and I think thatwe shall have no further trouble with him.\"They then thought it would be as well to see Mother Brigaut, and werereceived by the old woman with slavish deference. \n \n \"No one has been near the dear young gentleman,\" said she, in reply totheir questions. \"Last night he came down about seven o\u0027clock, andasked where the nearest eating-house was. I directed him to Du Val\u0027s,and he was back by eight, and by eleven I saw that he had put out hislight.\"\"How about to-day?\"\"I went up stairs at nine, and he had just finished dressing. He toldme to get his breakfast ready, which I did. He ate well, and I said tomyself, \u0027Good; the bird is getting used to its cage.\u0027 \"\"And then?\"\"Then he commenced singing like a very bird, the dear fellow. Hisvoice is as sweet as his face; any woman would fall in love with him. \n \n I\u0027m precious glad that my girl, Euphenice is nowhere near.\"\"And after that he went out?\" continued Tantaine. \"Did he say how longhe would be away?\"\"Only to give his lessons. I suppose he expected that you would call.\"\"Very good,\" remarked the old man; then, addressing Dr. Hortebise, hesaid, \"Perhaps, sir, you are going to the Registry Office?\"\"Yes; I want to see Mascarin.\"\"He is not there; but if you want to see him on any special matter,you had better come to our young friend\u0027s apartment, and await hisarrival.\"\"Very well, I will do so,\" answered the doctor. \n \n Hortebise was much more impressed than Paul with the skill of the handwhich had imparted such a look of long occupation to the rooms. \n \n \"On my word, the quiet simplicity of these rooms would induce anyfather to give his daughter to this young fellow.\"The old man\u0027s silence surprised him, and turning sharply round, he wasstruck by the gloomy look upon his features. \n \n \"What is the matter?\" asked Hortebise, with some anxiety. \"What istroubling you?\"Tantaine had thrown himself into a chair, and for a moment made noreply; then, springing to his feet, he gave the expiring embers afurious kick, and faced the doctor with folded arms. \n \n \"I see much trouble before us,\" said he at last. \n \n The doctor\u0027s face grew as gloomy as that of his companion. \n \n \"Is it Perpignan who interferes?\" asked he. \n \n \"No, Perpignan is only a fool; but he will do what I tell him.\"\"Then I really do not see--\"\"Do not see,\" exclaimed Tantaine; \"but luckily for us all, I am not soblind. Have you forgotten this marriage of De Croisenois? There liesthe danger. All had gone so smoothly, every combination had beenarranged, and every difficulty foreseen, and now----\"\"Well, you had made too sure, that was all; and you were unpreparedfor the slightest check.\"\"Not so, but I had made no attempt to guard against the impossible.\"\"Of course, there are limits to all human intelligence, but prayexplain yourself.\"\"This is it, then, doctor. The most adroit energy could never have putin our way such an obstacle as now threatens us. Have you in yourexperience of society ever come across a wealthy heiress who isindifferent to all the allurements of luxury, and is capable ofdisinterested love?\"The doctor smiled an expressive denial. \n \n \"But such an heiress does exist,\" said Tantaine, \"and her name isSabine de Mussidan. She loves--and whom do you think?--why a merepainter, who has crossed my path three times already. He is full, too,of energy and perseverance, and for these qualities I have never methis equal.\"\"What, a man without friends, money, or position, what can--\"A rapid gesture of Tantaine\u0027s checked his companion\u0027s speech. \n \n \"Unfortunately he is not without friends,\" remarked the genialTantaine. \"He has one friend at least; can you guess who it is? Noless a personage than the man who was to have married Sabine, M. deBreulh-Faverlay.\"At this unexpected news Hortebise remained silent and aghast. \n \n \"How on earth those two met I cannot imagine. It must have been Sabinethat brought them together, but the facts remain the same. They areclose friends anyhow. And these two men have in their interests thevery woman that I had selected to push De Croisenois\u0027 suit.\"\"Is it possible?\"\"That is my present belief. At any rate, these three had a longinterview last night, and doubtless came to a decision hostile to theinterests of the Marquis.\"\"What do you mean?\" asked Hortebise, his lips tightly compressed withanxiety. \"Do you mean that they are aware of the manner by which DeCroisenois hopes to succeed?\"\"Look here?\" answered Tantaine. \"A general, on the eve of a battle,takes every precaution, but among his subordinates there are alwaysfools, if not traitors. I had arranged a pretty little scene betweenCroisenois and Van Klopen, by which the Viscountess would be securelytrapped. Unfortunately, though the rehearsal was excellent, therepresentation was simply idiotic. Neither of the actors took theleast trouble to enter into the spirit of his part. I had arranged ascene full of delicacy and /finesse/, and they simply made a low,coarse exhibition of it and themselves. Fools! they thought it was theeasiest thing in the world to deceive a woman; and finally theMarquis, to whom I had recommended the most perfect discretion, openedfire, and actually spoke of Sabine and his desire to press his suit. \n \n The Viscountess found, with a woman\u0027s keen perceptions, that there wassomething arranged between Van Klopen and her visitor, and hurried offto her cousin, M. de Breulh-Faverlay for advice and assistance.\"The doctor listened to this recital, pallid and trembling. \n \n \"Who told you all this?\" gasped he. \n \n \"No one; I discovered it; and it was easy to do so. When we have aresult, it is easy to trace it back to the cause. Yes, this is whattook place.\"\"Why don\u0027t you say at once that the whole scheme is knocked on thehead?\" asked the doctor. \n \n \"Because I do not think that it is; I know that we have sustained avery severe check; but when you are playing /ecarte/ and youradversary has made five points to your one, you do not necessarilythrow down the cards and give up the game? Not a bit; you hold on andstrive to better your luck.\"The worthy Dr. Hortebise did not know whether the most to admire theperseverance or deplore the obstinacy of the old man, and exclaimed,--\"Why, this is utter madness; it is like plunging headlong into a deeppit, which you can easily see in your path.\"Tantaine gave a long, low whistle. \n \n \"My friend,\" said he, \"what in your opinion would be the best courseto pursue?\"\"I should say, without a moment\u0027s hesitation, turn up the wholescheme, and look out for another one, which, if less lucrative, wouldnot be so full of danger. You had hoped to win the game, and with goodreason too. Now throw aside all feelings of wounded vanity, and acceptyour defeat. After all, it does not matter to us who Mademoiselle deMussidan marries. The great enterprise fortunately does not lie inthis alliance. We have still the idea of the Company to which all oldpeople must subscribe remaining to us, and we can work it up at once.\"He stopped short, abashed by the look on Tantaine\u0027s face. \n \n \"It strikes me,\" resumed the doctor, a little mortified, \"that myproposal is not utterly ridiculous, and certainly deserves someconsideration.\"\"Perhaps so; but is it a practical one?\"\"I see o reason why it should not be.\"\"Indeed, then, you look at the thing in a very different manner tomyself. We are too far advanced, my dear doctor, to be our ownmasters. We must go on, and have no option to do otherwise. To beat aretreat would simply be to invite our enemies to fall upon ourdisorganized battalions. We must give battle; and as the first tostrike has always the best chance of victory, we must strive to takethe initiative.\"\"The idea is good, but these are mere words.\"\"Was the secret that we confided to De Croisenois only words?\"This thrust went home. \n \n \"Do you mean that you think he would betray us?\" said he. \n \n \"Why should he not if it were to his interests to do so? Reflect,Croisenois is almost at the end of his tether. We have dangled theline of a princely fortune before his eyes. Do you think he would donothing if we were to say, \u0027Excuse us, but we made a mistake; poor asyou are, so you must remain, for we do not intend to help you?\u0027 \"\"But is it necessary to say that at all?\"\"Well, at any rate, whatever we choose to say, what limit do you thinkhe will place upon his extortions now that he holds our secret? Wehave taught him his music, and he will make us do our part in thechorus, and can blackmail us as well as we can others.\"\"We played a foolish game,\" answered Dr. Hortebise moodily. \n \n \"No; we had to confide in some one. Besides, the two affairs, that ofMadame de Mussidan and the Duke de Champdoce, ran so well together. \n \n They were the simultaneous emanations of my brain. I worked them uptogether, and together they must stand or fall.\"\"Then you are determined to go on?\"\"Yes; more determined than ever.\"The doctor had been playing with his locket for some time, and thecontact of the cold metal seemed to have affected his nerves; for itwas in a trembling voice that he replied,--\"I vowed long ago that we should sink or swim together.\" He paused,and then, with a melancholy smile upon his face, continued,--\"I haveno intention of breaking my oath, you see; but I repeat, that yourroad seems to be a most perilous one, and I will add that I consideryou headstrong and self-opinionated; but for all that I will followyou, even though the path you have chosen leads to the grave. I haveat this moment a something between my fingers that will save me fromshame and disgrace--a little pill to be swallowed, a gasp, a littledizziness, and all is over.\"Tantaine did not seem to care for the doctor\u0027s explanation. \n \n \"There, that will do,\" said he. \"If things come to the worst, you canuse the contents of your locket as much as you like, but in themeantime leave it alone, and do not keep jingling it in thatdistracting manner. For people of our stamp a danger well known is acomparatively slight peril, for threats furnish us with means ofdefence. Woe, I say, woe to the man who crosses my path, for I willhold my hand from nothing!\" He stopped for a little, opened everydoor, and assured himself that there were no eavesdroppers, and then,in a low whisper, he said to Hortebise, \"Do you not see that there isbut one obstacle to our success, and that is Andre? Remove him, andthe whole of our machinery will work as smoothly as ever.\"Hortebise winced, as if suffering from a sudden pain. \n \n \"Do you mean----?\" asked he. \n \n But Tantaine interrupted him with a low laugh, terrible to listen to. \n \n \"And why not?\" said he. \"Is it not better to kill than to be killed?\"Hortebise trembled from head to foot. He had no objection to extortingmoney by the basest threats, but he drew the line at murder. \n \n \"And suppose we were found out?\" muttered he. \n \n \"Nonsense! How could we be discovered? Justice always looks for amotive; how, then could they bring it home to us? They could only findout that a young lady adored by De Breulh had thrown him over in orderto marry Andre.\"\"Horrible!\" murmured the doctor, much shocked. \n \n \"I daresay that it is horrible, and I have no wish to proceed toextremities. I only wish to speak of it as a remote possibility, andone that we may be compelled to adopt. I hate violence just as much asyou do, and trust that it may not be necessary.\"Just then the door opened, and Paul entered, a letter in his hand. Heseemed in excellent spirits, and shook hands with both his visitors. \n \n Tantaine smiled sarcastically as he contrasted Paul\u0027s high spiritswith the state of depression in which he had left him not many hoursago. \n \n \"Things are evidently going well with you,\" remarked the doctor,forcing a smile. \n \n \"Yes; I cannot find any reason for complaint.\"\"Have you given your lesson?\"\"Yes; what a delightful woman Madame Grandorge is! she has treated meso kindly.\"\"That is a good reason for your being so happy,\" remarked the doctor,with a tinge of irony in his voice. \n \n \"Ah, that is not the only reason,\" returned Paul. \n \n \"Shall I be indiscreet if I ask the real cause, then?\"\"I am not quite sure whether I ought to speak on this matter,\" said hefatuously. \n \n \"What! a love adventure already?\" laughed the doctor. \n \n The vanity of Paul\u0027s nature beamed out in a smile. \n \n \"Keep your secret, my boy,\" said Tantaine, in louder accents. \n \n This, of course, was enough to loosen Paul\u0027s tongue. \n \n \"Do you think, sir,\" said he, \"that I would keep anything from you?\"He opened the letter he held in his hand, continuing: \"The portresshanded this to me as I came in; she said it was left by a bankmessenger. Can you guess where it came from? Let me tell you--it isfrom Mademoiselle Flavia Rigal, and leaves no room to doubt of hersentiments toward me.\"\"Is that a fact?\"\"It is so; and whenever I choose, Mademoiselle Flavia will be only tooready to become Madame Paul.\"For an instant a bright flush crimsoned old Tantaine\u0027s wrinkled face,but it faded away almost as soon as it appeared. \n \n \"Then you feel happy?\" asked he, with a slight quiver in his voice. \n \n Paul threw back his coat, and, placing his fingers in the armholes ofhis waistcoat, remarked carelessly,--\"Yes, of course, I am happy, as you may suppose; but the news is notparticularly startling to me. On my third visit to M. Rigal\u0027s, thegirl let me know that I need not sigh in vain.\"Tantaine covered his face with his hands as Paul passed his fingersthrough his hair, and, striking what he considered an imposingattitude, read as follows:--\"MY DEAR PAUL,--\"I was very naughty, and I repent of it. I could not sleep allnight, for I was haunted by the look of sorrow I saw in your facewhen you took leave of me. Paul, I did it to try you. Can youforgive me? You might, for I suffered much more than you couldhave done. Some one who loves me--perhaps more than you do--hastold me that when a girl shows all the depths of her heart to aman she runs the risk of his despising her. Can this be true? Ihope not, Paul, for never--no, never--can I conceal my feelings;and the proof of my faith in you is that I am going now to tellyou all. I am sure that if your good friend and mine, Dr. \n \n Hortebise, came to my father with a certain request from you, itwould not be rejected. \n \n \"Your own\"FLAVIA.\"\"Did not this letter go straight to your heart?\" asked Tantaine. \n \n \"Of course it did. Why, she will have a million for her weddingportion!\"On hearing these words, Tantaine started up with so threatening anaspect that Paul recoiled a step, but a warning look from the doctorrestrained the old man\u0027s indignation. \n \n \"He is a perfect sham!\" muttered he; \"even his vices are merepretence.\"\"He is our pupil, and is what we have made him,\" whispered Tantaine. \n \n Meanwhile Tantaine had gone up to Paul, and, placing his handcaressingly on his shoulder, said,--\"My boy, you will never know how much you owe to Mademoiselle Flavia.\"Paul could not understand the meaning of this scene. These men haddone their best to pervert his morals, and to deaden the voice of hisconscience, and now that he had hoped to earn their praise by anaffectation of cynicism they were displeased with him. Before,however, he could ask a question, Tantaine had completely recoveredhis self-command. \n \n \"My dear boy,\" said he, \"I am quite satisfied with you. I came hereto-day expecting to find you still undecided, and I am pleased withthe change.\"\"But, sir--\" said Paul. \n \n \"On the contrary, you are firm and strong.\"\"Yes, he has got on so well,\" said the doctor, \"that we should nowtreat him as one of ourselves, and confide more in him. To-night, myyoung friend, M. Mascarin will get from Caroline Schimmel the solutionof the riddle that has for so long perplexed us. Be at the officeto-morrow at ten o\u0027clock, and you shall be told everything.\"Paul would have asked more questions, but Tantaine cut him short witha brief good-morning, and went off hurriedly, taking the doctor withhim, and seemingly wishing to avoid a hazardous and unpleasantexplanation. \n \n \"Let us get out of this,\" whispered he. \"In another moment I shouldhave knocked the conceited ass down. Oh, my Flavia! my poor Flavia! \n \n your weakness of to-day will yet cost you very dear!\"Paul remained rooted to the ground, with an expression of surprise andconfusion upon every line of his face. All his pride and vanity hadgone. \"I wonder,\" muttered he, \"what these disagreeable persons aresaying about me? Perhaps laughing at my inexperience and ridiculing myaspirations.\" The idea made him grind his teeth with rage; but he wasmistaken, for neither Tantaine nor the doctor mentioned his name afterthey had left his apartment. As they walked up the Rue Montmartre, alltheir ideas were turning upon how it would be easiest to checkmateAndre. \n \n \"I have not yet got sufficient information to act on,\" remarkedTantaine meditatively. \"My present plan is to remain perfectlyquiescent, and I have told Croisenois not to make a move of any kind. \n \n I have an eye and ear watching and listening when they thinkthemselves in perfect privacy. Very soon I shall fathom their plans,and then--, but in the meantime have faith in me, and do not let thematter worry you.\"On the boulevard Tantaine took leave of his friend. \n \n \"I shall very likely not see you to-night, for I have an appointmentat the Grand Turk with that precious young rascal, Toto Chupin. I/must/ find Caroline, for I am sure that with her lies the Champdocesecret. She is very cunning, but has a weakness for drink, and, withSatan\u0027s help, I hope to find out the special liquor which will makeher open her lips freely.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/935/28350.html","bookId":269,"book":{"id":269,"title":"Caught In The Net 落网","description":"简介： Emile Gaboriau (1833-1873) is an important figure in the history of detective fiction.
