{"id":8129,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4 A TRUSTWORTHY SERVANT.","content":"　　4In the city of Paris it is impossible to find a more fashionablequarter than the one which is bounded on the one side by the RueFaubourg Saint Honore and on the other by the Seine, and commences atthe Place de la Concorde and ends at the Avenue de l\u0027Imperatrice. Inthis favored spot millionaires seem to bloom like the rhododendron inthe sunny south. There are the magnificent palaces which they haveerected for their accommodation, where the turf is ever verdant, andwhere the flowers bloom perennially; but the most gorgeous of allthese mansions was the Hotel de Mussidan, the last /chef d\u0027oeuvre/ ofSevair, that skilful architect who died just as the world wasbeginning to recognize his talents. With a spacious courtyard in frontand a magnificent garden in the rear, the Hotel de Mussidan is aselegant as it is commodious. The exterior was extremely plain, and notdisfigured by florid ornamentation. White marble steps, with a lightand elegant railing at the sides, lead to the wide doors which openinto the hall. The busy hum of the servants at work at an early hourin the yard tells that an ample establishment is kept up. There can beseen luxurious carriages, for occasions of ceremony, and the parkphaeton, and the simple brougham which the Countess uses when she goesout shopping; and that carefully groomed thoroughbred is Mirette, thefavorite riding horse of Mademoiselle Sabine. Mascarin and hisconfederate descended from their cab a little distance at the cornerof the Avenue Matignon. Mascarin, in his dark suit, with his spotlesswhite cravat and glittering spectacles, looked like some highlyrespectable functionary of State. Hortebise wore his usual smile,though his cheek was pale. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now,\" remarked Mascarin, \"let me see,--on what footing do you standwith the Mussidans? Do they look upon you as a friend?\"\"No, no; a poor doctor, whose ancestors were not among the Crusades,could not be the intimate friend of such haughty nobles as theMussidans.\"\"But the Countess knows you, and will not refuse to receive you, norhave you turned out as soon as you begin to speak; for, taking shelterbehind some rogue without a name, you can shelter your own reputation. \\n\\n \\n\\n I will see the Count.\"\"Take care of him,\" said Hortebise thoughtfully. \"He has a reputationfor being a man of ungovernable temper, and, at the first word fromyou that he objects to, would throw you out of the window as soon aslook at you.\"Mascarin shrugged his shoulders. \"I can bring him to reason,\" answeredhe. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two confederates walked a little past the Hotel de Mussidan, andthe doctor explained the interior arrangements of the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I,\" continued Mascarin, \"will insist upon the Count\u0027s breaking offhis daughter\u0027s engagement with M. de Breulh-Faverlay, but shall notsay a word about the Marquis de Croisenois, while you will take theopportunity of putting his pretensions before the Countess, and willnot say a word of M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"\"I have learned my lesson, and shall not forget it.\"\"You see, doctor, the beauty of the whole affair is, that the Countesswill wonder how her husband will take her interference, while he willbe at a loss how to break the news to his wife. How surprised theywill be when they find that they have both the same end in view!\"There was something so droll in the whole affair, that the doctorburst into a loud laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We go by such different roads,\" said he, \"that they will neversuspect that we are working together. Faith! my dear Baptiste, you aremuch more clever than I thought.\"\"Don\u0027t praise me until you see that I am successful.\"Mascarin stopped opposite to a /café/ in the Faubourg Saint Honore. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait here for me, doctor,\" said he, \"while I make a little call. Ifall is all right; I will come for you again; then I will see theCount, and twenty minutes later do you go to the house and ask for theCountess.\"The clock struck four as the worthy confederates parted, and Mascarincontinued his way along the Faubourg Saint Honore, and again stoppedbefore a public house, which he entered, the master of which, FatherCanon, was so well known in the neighborhood that he had not thoughtit worth while to have his name painted over the door. He did notprofess to serve his best wine to casual customers, but for regularfrequenters of his house, chiefly the servants of noble families, hekept a better brand of wine. Mascarin\u0027s respectable appearanceinclined the landlord to step forward. Among Frenchmen, who are alwaysfull of gayety, a serious exterior is ever an excellent passport. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What can I do for you, sir?\" asked he with great politeness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can I see Florestan?\"\"In Count de Mussidan\u0027s service, I believe?\"\"Just so; I have an appointment with him here.\"\"He is downstairs in the band-room,\" replied the landlord. \"I willsend for him.\"\"Don\u0027t trouble; I will go down,\" and, without waiting for permission,Mascarin descended some steps that apparently led to a cellar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It appears to me,\" murmured Father Canon, \"that I have seen thiscove\u0027s face before.\"Mascarin pushed open a door at the bottom of the flight of stairs, anda strange and appalling noise issued from within (but this neithersurprised nor alarmed him), and entered a vaulted room arranged like a/café/, with seats and tables, filled with customers. In the centre,two men, in their shirt sleeves, with crimson faces, were performingupon horns; while an old man, with leather gaiters, buttoning to theknee, and a broad leather belt, was whistling the air the hornplayerswere executing. As Mascarin politely took off his hat, the performersceased, and the old man discontinued his whistling, while a well-builtyoung fellow, with pumps and stockings, and wearing a fashionablemustache, exclaimed,--\"Aha, it is that good old Mascarin. I was expecting you; will youdrink?\"Without waiting for further invitation Mascarin helped himself from abottle that stood near. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did Father Canon tell you that I was here?\" asked the young man, whowas the Florestan Mascarin had been inquiring for. \"You see,\"continued he, \"that the police will not permit us to practise thehorn; so, you observe, Father Canon has arranged this undergroundstudio, from whence no sound reaches the upper world.\"The hornplayers had now resumed their lessons, and Florestan wascompelled to place both hands to the side of his mouth, in order torender himself audible, and to shout with all his might. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That old fellow there is a huntsman in the service of the Duke deChampdoce, and is the finest hornplayer going. I have only had twentylessons from him, and am getting on wonderfully.\"\"Ah!\" exclaimed Mascarin, \"when I have more time I must hear yourperformance; but to-day I am in a hurry, and want to say a few wordsto you in private.\"\"Certainly, but suppose we go upstairs and ask for a private room.\"The rooms he referred to were not very luxuriously furnished, but wereadmirably suited for confidential communications; and had the wallsbeen able to speak, they could have told many a strange tale. \\n\\n \\n\\n Florestan and Mascarin seated themselves in one of these before asmall table, upon which Father Canon placed a bottle of wine and twoglasses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I asked you to meet me here, Florestan,\" began Mascarin, \"because youcan do me a little favor.\"\"Anything that is in my power I will do,\" said the young man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"First, a few words regarding yourself. How do you get on with Countde Mussidan?\"Mascarin had adopted an air of familiarity which he knew would pleasehis companion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care about the place,\" replied Florestan, \"and I am going toask Beaumarchef to look out another one for me.\"\"I am surprised at that; all your predecessors said that the Count wasa perfect gentleman--\"\"Just try him yourself,\" broke in the valet. \"In the first place he isas fickle as the wind, and awfully suspicious. He never leavesanything about,--no letters, no cigars, and no money. He spends halfhis time in locking things up, and goes to bed with his keys under hispillow.\"\"I allow that such suspicion on his part is most unpleasant.\"\"It is indeed, and besides he is awfully violent. He gets in a rageabout nothing, and half a dozen times in the day he looks ready tomurder you. On my word, I am really frightened at him.\"This account, coupled with what he had heard from Hortebise seemed torender Mascarin very thoughtful. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is he always like this, or only at intervals?\"\"He is always a beast, but he is worse after drink or losing at cards. \\n\\n \\n\\n He is never home until after four in the morning.\"\"And what does his wife say?\"The query made Florestan laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame does not bother herself about her lord and master, I canassure you. Sometimes they don\u0027t meet for weeks. All she wants isplenty of money. And ain\u0027t we just dunned!\"\"But the Mussidans are wealthy?\"\"Tremendously so, but at times there is not the value of a franc inthe house. Then Madame is like a tigress, and would sent to borrowfrom all her friends.\"\"But she must feel much humiliated?\"\"Not a bit; when she wants a heavy amount, she sends off to the Dukede Champdoce, and he always parts; but she doesn\u0027t mince matters withhim.\"\"It would seem as if you had known the contents of your mistress\u0027sletters?\" remarked Mascarin with a smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I have; I like to know what is in the letters I carryabout. She only says, \u0027My good friend, I want so much,\u0027 and back comesthe money without a word. Of course it is easy to see that there hasbeen something between them.\"\"Yes, evidently.\"\"And when master and missus do meet they only have rows, and suchrows! When the working man has had a drop too much, he beats his wife,she screams, then they kiss and make it up; but the Mussidans saythings to each other in cold blood that neither can ever forgive.\"From the air with which Mascarin listened to these details, it almostseemed as if he had been aware of them before. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then,\" said he, \"Mademoiselle Sabine is the only nice one in thehouse?\"\"Yes, she is always gentle and considerate.\"\"Then you think that M. de Breulh-Faverlay will be a happy man?\"\"Oh, yes; but perhaps this marriage will----\" but here Florestaninterrupted himself and assumed an air of extreme caution. Afterlooking carefully round, he lowered his voice, and continued,\"Mademoiselle Sabine has been left so much to herself that she actsjust as she thinks fit.\"\"Do you mean,\" asked Mascarin, \"that the young lady has a lover?\"\"Just so.\"\"But that must be wrong; and let me tell you that you ought not torepeat such a story.\"The man grew quite excited. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Story,\" repeated he; \"I know what I know. If I spoke of a lover, itis because I have seen him with my own eyes, not once, but twice.\"From the manner in which Mascarin received this intelligence,Florestan saw that he was interested in the highest degree. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you all about it,\" continued he. \"The first time was whenshe went to mass; it came on to rain suddenly, and Modeste, her maid,begged me to go for an umbrella. As soon as I came back I went in andsaw Mademoiselle Sabine standing by the receptacle for holy water,talking to a young fellow. Of course I dodged behind a pillar, andkept a watch on the pair--\"\"But you don\u0027t found all your story on this?\"\"I think you would, had you seen the way they looked into each other\u0027seyes.\"\"What was he like?\"\"Very good looking, about my height, with an aristocratic air.\"\"How about the second time?\"\"Ah, that is a longer story. I went one day with Mademoiselle when shewas going to see a friend in the Rue Marboeuf. She waited at a cornerof the street, and beckoned me to her. \u0027Florestan,\u0027 said she, \u0027Iforgot to post this letter; go and do so; I will wait here for you.\u0027 \"\"Of course you read it?\"\"No. I thought there was something wrong. She wants to get rid of you,so, instead of posting it, I slunk behind a tree and waited. I hadhardly done so, when the young fellow I had seen at the chapel cameround the corner; but I scarcely knew him. He was dressed just like aworking man, in a blouse all over plaster. They talked for about tenminutes, and Mademoiselle Sabine gave him what looked like aphotograph.\"By this time the bottle was empty, and Florestan was about to call foranother, when Mascarin checked him, saying--\"Not to-day; it is growing late, and I must tell you what I want youto do for me. Is the Count at home now?\"\"Of course he is; he has not left his room for two days, owing tohaving slipped going downstairs.\"\"Well, my lad, I must see your master; and if I sent up my card, theodds are he would not see me, so I rely upon you to show me up withoutannouncing me.\"Florestan remained silent for a few minutes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is no easy job,\" he muttered, \"for the Count does not likeunexpected visitors, and the Countess is with him just now. However,as I am not going to stay, I\u0027ll chance it.\"Mascarin rose from his seat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must not be seen together,\" said he; \"I\u0027ll settle the score; doyou go on, and I will follow in five minutes. Remember we don\u0027t knoweach other.\"\"I am fly; and mind you look out a good place for me.\"Mascarin paid the bill, and then looked into the /café/ to inform thedoctor of his movements, and a few minutes later, Florestan in hismost sonorous voice, threw open the door of his master\u0027s room andannounced,--\"M. Mascarin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/935/28329.html","bookId":269,"book":{"id":269,"title":"Caught In The Net 落网","description":"简介： Emile Gaboriau (1833-1873) is an important figure in the history of detective fiction.
