Had his intention been to startle his audience, hehad most certainly succeeded. Paul was breathless with interest, andCroisenois broke down in attempting to make one of his usual trivialremarks. He was not particularly intelligent, except as regarded hisself-interests, and though, of course, he knew that there must be someconnection between his interests and the recital that Mascarin hadjust made, he could not for the life of him make out what it was. \n \n Mascarin seemed utterly careless of the effect that he had produced. \n \n But the next time that his walk brought him to his desk he stopped,and, adjusting his glasses, said, \"I trust, Marquis, that you willforgive this long preliminary address, which would really make a goodsensational novel; but we have now arrived at the really practicalpart of the business.\" As he said these words, he took up an imposingattitude, with his elbow resting on the mantelpiece. \n \n \"On the night of which I have spoken, I and my friends releasedourselves from all the bonds of virtue and honor, and freed ourselvesfrom all the fetters of duty to our fellow-men. The plan emanated frommy brain complete in all its details in the will I made twenty yearsago to my friends. Marquis, as the summer goes on, you know that theripest and reddest cherries are the fullest flavored, just so, in thenoblest and wealthiest of families in Paris there is not one that hasnot some terrible and ghostly secret which is sedulously concealed. \n \n Now, suppose that one man should gain possession of all of them, wouldhe not be sole and absolute master? Would he not be more powerful thana despot on his throne? Would he not be able to sway society in anymanner he might think fit? Well, I said to myself, I will be thatman!\"Ever since the Marquis had been in relation with Mascarin, he hadshrewdly suspected that his business was not conducted on really fairprinciples. \n \n \"What you mention,\" said he, \"is nothing but an elaborate and extendedsystem of blackmail.\"Mascarin bowed low, with an ironical smile on his face. \"Just so,Marquis, just so; you have hit on the very name. The word is modern,but the operation doubtless dates from the earliest ages. The day uponwhich one man began to trade upon the guilty secret of another was thedate of the institution of this line of business. If antiquity makes athing respectable, then blackmailing is worthy of great respect.\"\"But, sir,\" said the Marquis, with a flush upon his face, \"but, sir--\"\"Pshaw!\" broke in Mascarin, \"does a mere word frighten you? Who hasnot done some of it in his time? Why, look at yourself. Do you notrecollect this winter that you detected a young man cheating at cards? \n \n You said nothing to him at the time, but you found out that he wasrich, and, calling upon him the next day, borrowed ten thousandfrancs. When do you intend to repay that loan?\"Croisenois sank back in his chair, overcome with surprise at thisdisplay of knowledge on Mascarin\u0027s part. \"This is too terrible,\"muttered he, but Mascarin went on,--\"I know, at least, two thousand persons in Paris who only exist by theexercise of this profession; for I have studied them all, from theconvict who screws money out of his former companions, in penalservitude, to the titled villain, who, having discovered the frailtyof some unhappy woman, forces her to give him her daughter as hiswife. I know a mere messenger in the Rue Douai, who in five yearsamassed a comfortable fortune. Can you guess how? When he wasintrusted with a letter, he invariably opened it, and made himselfmaster of its contents, and if there was a compromising word in it, hepounced down upon either the writer or the person to whom it wasaddressed. I also know of one large limited company which pays anannual income to a scoundrel with half a dozen foreign orders, who hasfound out that they have broken their statues of association, andholds proofs of their having done so. But the police are on the alert,and our courts deal very severely with blackmailers.\"Mascarin went on: \"The English, however, are our masters, for inLondon a compromising servant is as easily negotiable as a sound billof exchange. There is in the city a respectable jeweller, who willadvance money on any compromising letter with a good name at the foot. \n \n His shop is a regular pawnshop of infamy. In the States it has beenelevated to the dignity of a profession, and the citizen at New Yorkdreads the blackmailers more than the police, if he is meditating somedishonorable action. Our first operations did not bring in any quickreturns, and the harvest promised to be a late one; but you have comeupon us just as we are about to reap our harvest. The professions ofHortebise and Catenac--the one a doctor and the other a lawyer--facilitated our operations greatly. One administered to the diseasesof the body, and the other to that of the purse, and, of course, thusthey became professors of many secrets. As for me, the head and chief,it would not do to remain an idle looker-on. Our funds had dwindleddown a good deal, and, after mature consideration, I decided to hirethis house, and open a Servants\u0027 Registry Office. Such an occupationwould not attract any attention, and in the end it turned out aperfect success, as my friends can testify.\"Catenac and Hortebise both nodded assent. \n \n \"By the system which I have adopted,\" resumed Mascarin, \"the wealthyand respectable man is as strictly watched in his own house as is thecondemned wretch in his cell; for no act of his escapes the eyes ofthe servants whom we have placed around him. He can hardly evenconceal his thoughts from us. Even the very secret that he hasmurmured to his wife with closed doors reaches our ears.\"The Marquis gave a supercilious smile. \n \n \"You must have had some inkling of this,\" observed Mascarin, \"for youhave never taken a servant from our establishment; but for all that, Iam as well posted up in your affairs as yourself. You have even nowabout you a valet of whom you know nothing.\"\"Morel was recommended to me by one of my most intimate friends--SirRichard Wakefield.\"\"But for all that I have had my suspicions of him; but we will talk ofthis later, and we will now return to the subject upon which we havemet. As I told you, I conceal the immense power I had attained throughour agency, and use it as occasion presents itself, and after twentyyears\u0027 patient labor, I am about to reap a stupendous harvest. Thepolice pay enormous sums to their secret agents, while I, withoutopening my purse, have an army of devoted adherents. I see perhapsfifty servants of both sexes daily; calculate what this will amount toin a year.\"There was an air of complacency about the man as he explained theworking of his system, and a ring of triumph in his voice. \n \n \"You must not think that all my agents are in my secrets, for thegreater part of them are quite unaware of what they are doing, and inthis lies my strength. Each of them brings me a slender thread, whichI twine into the mighty cord by which I hold my slaves. Theseunsuspecting agents remind me of those strange Brazilian birds, whosepresence is a sure sign that water is to be found near at hand. Whenone of them utters a note, I dig, and I find. And now, Marquis, do youunderstand the aim and end of our association?\"\"It has,\" remarked Hortebise quietly, \"brought us in some years twohundred and fifty thousand francs apiece.\"If M. de Croisenois disliked prosy tales, he by no means underratedthe eloquence of figures. He knew quite enough of Paris to understandthat if Mascarin threw his net regularly, he would infallibly catchmany fish. With this conviction firmly implanted in his mind, he didnot require much urging to look with favor on the scheme, and, puttingon a gracious smile, he now asked, \"And what must I do to deserveadmission into this association?\"Paul had listened in wonder and terror, but by degrees all feelings ofdisgust at the criminality of these men faded away before the powerthat they unquestionably possessed. \n \n \"If,\" resumed Mascarin, \"we have up to this met with no seriousobstacles, it is because, though apparently acting rashly, we are inreality most prudent and cautious. We have managed our slaves well,and have not driven any one to desperation. But we are beginning toweary of our profession; we are getting old, and we have need ofrepose. We intend, therefore, to retire, but before that we wish tohave all matters securely settled. I have an immense mass ofdocumentary evidence, but it is not always easy to realize the valuethey represent, and I wait upon your assistance to enable me to doso.\"Croisenois\u0027 face fell. Was he to take compromising letters round tohis acquaintances and boldly say, \"Your purse or your honor?\" He hadno objection to share the profits of this ignoble trade, but heobjected strongly to showing his connection with it openly. \"No, no,\"cried he hastily, \"you must not depend upon me.\"He seemed so much in earnest that Hortebise and Catenac exchangedglances of dismay. \n \n \"Let us have no nonsense,\" returned Mascarin sternly, \"and wait alittle before you display so much fierceness. I told you that mydocumentary evidence was of a peculiar kind. We very often had amongour fish married people who cannot deal with their personal property. \n \n A husband, for instance, will say, \u0027I can\u0027t take ten thousand francswithout my wife, knowing of it.\u0027 Women say, \u0027Why, I get all my moneythrough my husband,\u0027 and both are telling the truth. They kneel at myfeet and entreat me to have mercy, saying, \u0027Find me some excuse forusing a portion of my funds and you shall have more than you ask.\u0027 Fora long time I have sought for this means, and at last I have found itin the Limited Company, which you, Marquis, will float next month.\"\"Really!\" returned the Marquis. \"I do not see--\"\"I beg your pardon; you see it all clearly. A husband who cannot,without fear of disturbing his domestic peace, put in five thousandfrancs, can put in ten thousand if he tells his wife, \u0027It is aninvestment;\u0027 and many a wife who has not any money of her own willpersuade her husband to bring in the money we require by the proposalto take shares. Now, what do you say to the idea?\"\"I think that it is an excellent one, but what part am I to play init?\"\"In taking the part of Chairman of the Company. I could not do so,being merely the proprietor of a Servant\u0027s Registry Office. Hortebise,as a doctor, and more than all a homeopath, would inspire noconfidence, and Catenac\u0027s legal profession prevents him appearing inthe matter openly. He will act as our legal adviser.\"\"But really I do not see anything about me that would induce people toinvest,\" remarked De Croisenois. \n \n \"You are too modest; you have your name and rank, which, however wemay look upon them, have a great effect upon the general public. Thereare many Companies who pay directors of rank and credible connectionvery largely. Before starting this enterprise you can settle all yourdebts, and the world will then conclude that you are possessed ofgreat wealth, while, at the same time, the news of your approachingmarriage with Mademoiselle du Mussidan will be the general talk ofsociety. What better position could you be in?\"\"But I have the reputation of being a reckless spendthrift.\"\"All the better. The day the prospectus comes out with your name atthe head of it, there will be a universal burst of laughter. Men willsay, \u0027Do you see what Croisenois is at now? What on earth possessedhim to go into Company work?\u0027 But as this proceeding on your part willhave paid your debts and given you Mademoiselle Sabine\u0027s dowry, Ithink that the laugh will be on your side.\"The prospect dazzled Des Croisenois. \n \n \"And suppose I accept,\" asked he, \"what will be the end of the farce?\"\"Very simple. When all the shares are taken up, you will close theoffice and let the Company look after itself.\"Croisenois started to his feet angrily. \"Why,\" cried he, \"you intendto make a catspaw of me! Such a proceeding would send me to penalservitude.\"\"What an ungrateful man he is!\" said Mascarin, appealing to hisaudience, \"when I am doing all I can to prevent his going there.\"\"Sir!\"But Catenac now felt it time to interfere. \"You do not understand,\"remarked he, addressing Croisenois. \"You will start a Company for thedevelopment of some native product, let us say Pyrenean marble, forinstance, issue a prospectus, and the shares will be at once taken upby Mascarin\u0027s clients.\"\"Well, what happens then?\"\"Why, out of the funds thus obtained we will take care when the crashcomes to reimburse any outsiders who may have taken shares in theconcern, telling them that the thing has been a failure, and that weare ruined; while Mascarin will take care to obtain from all hisclients a discharge in full, so the Company will quietly collapse.\"\"But,\" objected the Marquis, \"all the shareholders will know that I ama rogue.\"\"Naturally.\"\"They would hold me in utter contempt.\"\"Perhaps so, but they would never venture to let you see it. I neverthought that you would make objections; and whose character, howeverdeep, will bear investigation?\"\"Are you sure that you hold your people securely?\" asked he; \"and thatnone of them will turn surly?\"Mascarin was waiting for this question, and taking from his desk thepieces of cardboard which he took so much pains to arrange, hereplied, \"I have here the names of three hundred and fifty people whowill each invest ten thousand francs in the Company. Listen to me, andjudge for yourself.\"He put all three pieces of cardboard together, and then drawing outone he read,--\" \u0027N---, civil engineer. Five letters written by him to the gentlemanwho procured his appointment for him: worth fifteen thousand francs.\u0027 \n \n \" \u0027P---, merchant. Absolute proof that his last bankruptcy was afraudulent one, and that he kept back from his creditors two hundredthousand francs. Good for twenty thousand francs.\u0027 \n \n \" \u0027Madame V---. A photograph taken in very light and airy costume. \n \n Poor, but can pay three thousand francs.\u0027 \n \n \" \u0027M. H---. Three letters from her mother, proving that the daughterhad compromised herself before marriage. Letter from a monthly nurseappended. Can be made to pay ten thousand francs.\u0027 \n \n \" \u0027X---, a portion of his correspondence with L--- in 1848. Threethousand francs.\u0027 \n \n \" \u0027Madame M. de M---. A true history of her adventure with M. J---.\u0027 \"This sample was quite sufficient to satisfy M. de Croisenois. \n \n \"Enough,\" cried he, \"I yield. I bow before your gigantic power, whichutterly surpasses that of the police. Give me your orders.\"Before this Mascarin had conquered Hortebise and Paul Violaine, andnow he had the Marquis at his feet. Many times during thisconversation the Marquis had more than once endeavored to make up hismind to withdraw entirely from the business, but he had been unable toresist the strange fascination of that mysterious person who had beenlaying bare his scheme with such extraordinary audacity. The fewvestiges of honesty that were still left in his corrupted soulrevolted at the thought of the shameful compact into which he wasabout to enter, but the dazzling prospect held out before his eyessilenced his scruples, and he felt a certain pride in being theassociate of men who possessed such seemingly illimitable power. \n \n Mascarin saw that there was no longer any necessity for the extremefirmness with which he had before spoken, and it was with the moststudied courtesy that he replied: \"I have no orders to give you,Marquis, our interests are identical, and we must all have a voice inthe deliberations as to the best means of carrying them out.\"This change from /hauteur/ to suavity gratified Croisenois\u0027 prideimmensely. \n \n \"Now,\" continued Mascarin, \"let us speak of your own circumstances. \n \n You wrote to me recently that you had nothing, and I am aware that youhave no expectations for the future.\"\"Excuse me, but there is the fortune of my poor brother George, whodisappeared so mysteriously.\"\"Let me assure you,\" answered Mascarin, \"that we had better beperfectly frank with each other.\"\"And am I not so?\" answered the Marquis. \n \n \"Why, in talking of this imaginary fortune?\"\"It is not imaginary; it is real, and a very large one, too, abouttwelve or fourteen hundred thousand francs, and I can obtain it, for,by Articles 127 and 129 of the Code Napoleon---\"He interrupted himself, as he saw an expression of hardly-restrainedlaughter upon the features of Dr. Hortebise. \n \n \"Do not talk nonsense,\" answered Mascarin. \"You could at first havefiled an affidavit regarding your brother\u0027s disappearance, and appliedto the Court to appoint you trustee, but this is now exactly what youwish to avoid.\"\"Why not, pray? Do you think----\"\"Pooh, pooh, but you have raised so much money on this inheritancethat there is nothing of it left hardly, certainly not sufficient topay your debts. It is the bait you used to allure your tradespeopleinto giving you credit.\"At finding himself so easily fathomed, Croisenois burst into a peel oflaughter. Mascarin had by this time thrown himself into an armchair,as though utterly worn out by fatigue. \n \n \"There is no necessity, Marquis,\" said he, \"to detain you here longer. \n \n We shall meet again shortly, and settle matters. Meanwhile Catenacwill draw up the prospectus and Articles of Association of theproposed Company, and post you up in the financial slang of which youmust occasionally make use.\"The Marquis and the lawyer at once rose and took their leave. As soonas the door had closed behind them, Mascarin seemed to recover hisenergy. \n \n \"Well, Paul,\" said he, \"what do you think of all this?\"Like all men with weak and ductile natures, Paul, after being almostprostrated by the first discovery of his master\u0027s villainy, had nowsucceeded in smothering the dictates of his conscience, and adopted acynical tone quite worthy of his companions. \n \n \"I see,\" said he, \"that you have need of me. Well, I am not a Marquis,but you will find me quite as trustworthy and obedient.\"Paul\u0027s reply did not seem to surprise Mascarin, but it is doubtfulwhether he was pleased by it, for his countenance showed traces of astruggle between extreme satisfaction and intense annoyance, while thedoctor was surprised at the cool audacity of the young man whose mindhe had undertaken to form. \n \n Paul was a little disturbed by the long and continued silence of hispatron, and at last he ventured to say timidly,--\"Well, sir, I am anxious to know under what conditions I am to beshown the way to make my fortune and marry Mademoiselle Flavia Rigal,whom I love.\"Mascarin gave a diabolical smile. \n \n \"Whose dowry you love,\" he observed. \"Let us speak plainly.\"\"Pardon me, sir, I said just what I meant.\"The doctor, who had not Mascarin\u0027s reasons for gravity, now burst intoa jovial laugh. \n \n \"And that pretty Rose,\" said he, \"what of her?\"\"Rose is a creature of the past,\" answered Paul. \"I can now see whatan idiot I was, and I have entirely effaced her from my memory, and Iam half inclined to deplore that Mademoiselle Rigal is an heiress, themore so if it is to form a barrier between us.\"This declaration seemed to make Mascarin more easy. \n \n \"Reassure yourself, my boy,\" said he, \"we will remove that barrier;but I will not conceal from you that the part you have to play is muchmore difficult than that assigned to the Marquis de Croisenois; but ifit is harder and more perilous, the reward will be proportionatelygreater.\"\"With your aid and advice I feel capable of doing everythingnecessary,\" returned Paul. \n \n \"You will need great self-confidence, the utmost self-possession, andas a commencement you must utterly destroy your present identity.\"\"That I will do with the utmost willingness.\"\"You must become another person entirely; you must adopt his name, hisgait, his behavior, his virtues, and even his failings. You mustforget all that you have either said or done. You must always thinkthat you are in reality the person you represent yourself to be, forthis is the only way in which you can lead others into a similarbelief. Your task will be a heavy one.\"\"Ah, sir,\" cried the young man, enthusiastically, \"can you doubt me?\"\"The glorious beam of success that shines ahead of you will take yourattention from the difficulties and dangers of the road that you aretreading.\"The genial Dr. Hortebise rubbed his hands. \n \n \"You are right,\" cried he, \"quite right.\"\"When you have done this,\" resumed Mascarin, \"we shall not hesitate toacquaint you with the secret of the lofty destiny that awaits you. Doyou understand me fully?\"Here the speaker was interrupted by the entrance of Beaumarchef, whohad signified his desire to come in by three distinct raps upon thedoor. He was now gorgeous to look upon, for having taken advantage ofa spare half hour, he had donned his best clothes. \n \n \"What is it?\" demanded Mascarin. \n \n \"Here are two letters, sir.\"\"Thank you; hand them to me, and leave us.\"As soon as they were once more alone, Mascarin examined the letters. \n \n \"Ah,\" cried he, \"one from Van Klopen, and the other from the Hotel deMussidan. Let us first see what our friend the man-milliner has tosay. \n \n \"DEAR SIR,--\"You may be at ease. Our mutual friend Verminet has executed yourorders most adroitly. At his instigation Gaston de Gandelu hasforged the banker Martin Rigal\u0027s signature on five differentbills. I hold them, and awaiting your further orders regardingthem, and also with respect to Madame de Bois Arden,\"I remain your obedient servant,\"VAN KLOPEN.\"Tossing it on the table, Mascarin opened the other letter, which healso read aloud. \n \n \"SIR,--\"I have to report to you the breaking off of the marriage betweenMademoiselle Sabine and M. de Breulh-Faverlay. Mademoiselle isvery ill, and I heard the medical man say that she might notsurvive the next twenty-four hours. \n \n \"FLORESTAN.\"Mascarin was so filled with rage on learning this piece of news, whichseemed likely to interfere with his plans, that he struck his handdown heavily on the table. \n \n \"Damnation!\" cried he. \"If this little fool should die now, all ourwork will have to be recommenced.\"He thrust aside his chair, and paced hurriedly up and down the room. \n \n \"Florestan is right,\" said he; \"this illness of the girl comes on atthe date of the rupture of the engagement. There is some secret thatwe must learn, for we dare not work in the dark.\"\"Shall I go to the Hotel de Mussidan?\" asked Hortebise. \n \n \"Not a bad idea. Your carriage is waiting, is it not? You can go inyour capacity as a medical man.\"The doctor was preparing to go, when Mascarin arrested his progress. \n \n \"No,\" said he, \"I have changed my mind. We must neither of us be seennear the place. I expect that one of our mines has exploded; that theCount and Countess have exchanged confidences, and that between thetwo the daughter has been struck down.\"\"How shall we find this out?\"\"I will see Florestan and try and find out.\"In an instant he vanished into his inner room, and as he changed hisdress, continued to converse with the doctor. \n \n \"This blow would be comparatively trifling, if I had not so much onhand, but I have Paul to look after. The Champdoce affair must bepressed on, for Catenac, the traitor, has put the Duke and Perpignaninto communication. I must see Perpignan and discover how much hasbeen told him, and how much he has guessed. I will also see CarolineSchimmel, and extract something from her. I wish to heaven that therewere thirty-six hours in the day instead of only twenty-four.\"By this time he had completed his change of costume and called thedoctor into his room. \n \n \"I am off, now,\" whispered he; \"do not lose sight of Paul for a singleinstant, for we are not sufficiently sure of him to let him go aboutalone with our secret in his possession. Take him to dine at MartinRigal\u0027s, and then make some excuse for keeping him all night at yourrooms. See me to-morrow.\"And he went out so hurriedly that he did not hear the cheery voice ofthe doctor calling after him,--\"Good luck; I wish you all good luck.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/935/28343.html","bookId":269,"book":{"id":269,"title":"Caught In The Net 落网","description":"简介： Emile Gaboriau (1833-1873) is an important figure in the history of detective fiction.
