{"id":8149,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24 AN ARTFUL TRICK.","content":"　　24Andre had removed his coat and donned his blouse, the sleeves of whichwere rolled up to his shoulders. \"I must get to business,\" murmuredhe, \"to make up for lost time.\" He set to work with great vigor, buthad hardly got into the swing, when a lad came actively up the ladderand told him that a gentleman wished to see him, \"and a real swell,too,\" added the boy. Andre was a good deal put out at being disturbed,but when he reached the street and saw that it was M. de Breulh-Faverlay who was waiting for him, his ill-humor disappeared like chaffbefore the wind. \n \n \"Ah, this is really kind of you,\" cried he; for he could never forgetthe debt of gratitude he owed to the gentleman. \"A thousand thanks forremembering me. Excuse my not shaking hands, but see;\" and heexhibited his palms all white with plaster. As he did so the smiledied away on his lips, for he caught sight of his friend\u0027s face. \n \n \"What is the matter?\" exclaimed he, anxiously. \"Is Sabine worse? Hasshe had a relapse?\"De Breulh shook his head, but the expression of his face clearlysaid,--\"Would to heavens it were only that!\"But the news that Sabine was not worse relieved Andre at once, and hepatiently waited for his friend to explain. \n \n \"I have seen her twice for you,\" answered De Breulh; \"but it isabsolutely necessary that you should come to a prompt decision on animportant affair.\"\"I am quite at your service,\" returned Andre a good deal surprised andtroubled. \n \n \"Then come with me at once, I did not drive here, but we shall not bemore than a quarter of an hour in reaching my house.\"\"I will follow you almost immediately. I only ask five minutes\u0027 graceto go up to the scaffold again.\"\"Have you any orders to give?\"\"No, I have none.\"\"Why should you go, then?\"\"To make myself a little more presentable.\"\"Is it an annoyance or inconvenience for you to go out in that dress?\"\"Not a bit, I am thoroughly used to it; but it was for your sake.\"\"If that is all, come along.\"\"But people will stare at seeing you in company with a commonworkman.\"\"Let them stare.\" And drawing Andre\u0027s arm through his, M. de Breulhset off. \n \n Andre was right; many persons did turn round to look at thefashionably dressed gentleman walking arm in arm with a mason in hisworking attire, but De Breulh took but little heed, and to all Andre\u0027squestions simply said, \"Wait till we reach my house.\"At length they arrived, without having exchanged twenty words, andentering the library closed the door. M. de Breulh did not inflict thetorture of suspense upon his young friend a moment longer than wasnecessary. \n \n \"This morning, about twelve o\u0027clock, as I was crossing the Avenue deMatignon, I saw Modeste, who had been waiting for you more than anhour.\"\"I could not help it.\"\"I know that. As soon as she saw me, she ran up to me at once. She wasterribly disappointed at not having seen you; but knowing ourintimacy, she intrusted me with a letter for you from Mademoiselle deMussidan.\"Andre shuddered; he felt that the note contained evil tidings, withwhich De Breulh was already acquainted. \"Give it to me,\" said he, andwith trembling hands he tore open the letter and perused its contents. \n \n \"DEAREST ANDRE,--\"I love you, and shall ever continue to do so, but I have duties--most holy ones--which I must fulfil; duties which my name andposition demand of me, even should the act cost me my life. Weshall never meet again in this world, and this letter is the lastone you will ever receive from me. Before long you will see theannouncement of my marriage. Pity me, for great as yourwretchedness will be, it will be as nothing compared to mine. \n \n Heaven have mercy upon us both! Andre, try and tear me out of yourheart. I have not even the right to die, and oh, my darling,this--this is the last word you will ever receive from your poorunhappy\"SABINE.\"If M. de Breulh had insisted upon taking Andre home with him before hehanded him the letter, it was because Modeste had given him someinkling of its contents. He feared that the effect would be tremendousupon nerves so highly strung and sensitive as those of Andre. But heneed not have been alarmed on this point. As the young paintermastered the contents of the letter his features became ghastly pale,and a shudder convulsed every nerve and muscle of his frame. With amechanical gesture he extended the paper to M. de Breulh, uttering theone word, \"Read.\"His friend obeyed him, more alarmed by Andre\u0027s laconism than he couldhave been by some sudden explosion of passion. \n \n \"Do not lose heart,\" exclaimed he. \n \n But Andre interrupted him. \"Lose heart!\" said he; \"you do not know me. \n \n When Sabine was ill, perhaps dying, far away from me, I did feel castdown; but now that she tells me that she loves me, my feelings are ofan entirely different nature.\"M. de Breulh was about to speak, but Andre went on. \n \n \"What is this marriage contract which my poor Sabine announces to me,as if it was her death-warrant? Her parents must all along haveintended to break with you, but you were beforehand with them. Canthey have received a more advantageous offer of marriage already? Itis scarcely likely. When she confided the secret of her life to you,she certainly knew nothing of this. What terrible event has happenedsince then? My brave Sabine would never have submitted unless somecoercion had been used that she could not struggle against; she wouldrather have quitted her father\u0027s house for ever.\"As Andre uttered these words De Breulh\u0027s mind was busy with similarreflections, for Modeste had given him some hint of the approachingmarriage, and had begged him to be most careful how he communicatedthe facts to Andre. \n \n \"You must have noticed,\" continued the young painter, \"the strangecoincidence between Sabine\u0027s illness and this note. You left her happyand full of hope, and an hour afterward she falls senseless, as thoughstruck by lightning; as soon as she recovers a little she sends methis terrible letter. Do you remember that Madame de Bois Arden toldus that during Sabine\u0027s illness her father and mother never left herbedside? Was not this for fear lest some guilty secret of theirs mightescape her lips in a crisis of delirium?\"\"Yes, I remember that, and I have long had reason to imagine thatthere is some terrible family secret in the Mussidans\u0027 family, such aswe too often find among the descendants of noble houses.\"\"What can it be?\"\"That I have no means of ascertaining, but that there is one I amsure.\"Andre turned away and paced rapidly up and down the room. \"Yes,\" saidhe, suddenly, \"there is a mystery; but you and I will leave no stoneunturned until we penetrate it.\" He drew a chair close to the side ofhis friend, who was reclining on a couch. \"Listen,\" said he, \"andcorrect me if you fancy that I am not right in what I am saying. Doyou believe that the most terrible necessity alone has compelledSabine to write this letter?\"\"Most certainly.\"\"Both the Count and Countess were willing to accept you as their son-in-law?\"\"Exactly so.\"\"Could M. de Mussidan have found a more brilliant match for hisdaughter, one who could unite so many advantages of experience andeducation to so enormous a fortune?\"De Breulh could hardly repress a smile. \n \n \"I am not wishing to pay you a compliment,\" said Andre impatiently. \n \n \"Reply to my question.\"\"Very well then, I admit that according to the opinion of the world, Iwas a most eligible suitor, and that M. de Mussidan would find it hardto replace me.\"\"Then tell me how it comes about that neither the Count nor theCountess has made any effort to prevent this rupture?\"\"Their pride, perhaps, has been wounded.\"\"Not so, for Modeste tells us that on the very day you sent the letterthe Count was going to call on you to break off the engagement.\"\"Yes, that is so, if we are to believe Modeste.\"As if to give more emphasis to his words, Andre started to his feet. \n \n \"This,\" cried he, \"this man, who has so suddenly appeared upon thescene, will marry Sabine, not only against her own will, but againstthat of her parents, and for what reason? Who is this man, and what isthe mysterious power that he possesses? His power is too great tospring from an honorable source. Sabine is sacrificing herself to thisman for some reason or other, and he, like a dastardly cur, is readyto take advantage of the nobleness of her heart.\"\"I admit the correctness of your supposition,\" said he; \"and now, howdo you propose to act?\"\"I shall do nothing as yet,\" answered the young man, with a fiercegleam in his eyes. \"Sabine asks me to tear her from my heart. I willaffect to do so for the time. Modeste believes in me, and will helpme. I have patience. The villain who has wrecked my life does not knowme, and I will only reveal myself upon the day that I hold himhelpless in my hand.\"\"Take care, Andre,\" urged De Breulh; \"a false step would ruin yourhopes for ever.\"\"I will make none; as soon as I have this man\u0027s name, I will insulthim; there will be a duel, and I shall kill him--or he me.\"\"A duel will be the height of madness, and would ruin all your hopesof marriage with Sabine.\"\"The only thing that holds me back is that I do not wish that thereshould be a corpse between Sabine and myself. Blood on a bridal dress,they say, brings misery; and if this man is what I suspect him to be,I should be doing him too much honor if I crossed swords with him. No,I must have a deeper vengeance than this, for I can never forget thathe nearly caused Sabine\u0027s death.\"He paused for a few seconds, and once again broke the silence whichreigned in the room. \n \n \"To abuse the power that he must possess shows what a miserable wretchhe must be; and men do not attain such a height of infamy by a singlebound. The course of his life must be full of similar crimes, growingdeeper and deadlier as he moves on. I will make it my business tounmask him and to hold him up to the scorn and contempt of his fellow-men.\"\"Yes; that is the plan to pursue.\"\"And we will do so, sir. Ah! heaven help me! I say \u0027we,\u0027 for I haverelied on you. The generous offer that you made to me I refused, and Iwas in the right in doing so; but I should now be a mere madman if Idid not entreat you to grant me your aid and advice. We have bothknown hardship and are capable of going without food or sleep, ifnecessity requires it of us. We have both graduated in the school ofpoverty and sorrow. We can keep our plans to ourselves and act.\"Andre paused, as if waiting for a reply, but his friend remainedsilent. \n \n \"My plan is most simple,\" resumed the young painter. \"As soon as weknow the fellow\u0027s name we shall be able to act. He will never suspectus, and we can follow him like his very shadow. There are professionaldetectives who, for a comparatively small sum, will lay bare a man\u0027sentire life. Are we not as clever as this fine fellow? We can workwell together in our different circles; you, in the world of fashion,can pick up intelligence that I could not hope to gain; while I, frommy lowly position, will study the hidden side of his life, for I cantalk to the servants lounging at the front doors or the grooms at thepublic-houses without suspicion.\"M. de Breulh was delighted at finding that he could have someoccupation which would fill up the dreary monotony of his life. \n \n \"I am yours!\" cried he; \"and will work with you heart and soul!\"Before the artist could reply a loud blow was struck upon the librarydoor, and a woman\u0027s voice exclaimed,--\"Let me in, Gontran, at once.\"\"It is Madame de Bois Arden,\" remarked De Breulh, drawing the boltback; and the Viscountess rushed hastily into the room and threwherself into a low chair. \n \n Her beautiful face was bedewed with tears, and she was in a terriblestate of excitement. \n \n \"What is the matter, Clotilde?\" asked De Breulh kindly, as he took herhand. \n \n \"Something terrible,\" answered she with a sob; \"but you may be able tohelp me. Can you lend me twenty thousand francs?\"De Breulh smiled; a heavy weight had been lifted from his heart. \n \n \"If that is all you require, do not shed any more tears.\"\"But I want them at once.\"\"Can you give me half an hour?\"\"Yes; but lose no time.\"De Breulh drew a check and despatched his valet for the money. \n \n \"A thousand thanks!\" said the Viscountess; \"but money is not all thatI require, I want your advice.\"Andre was about to leave the cousins together, but the lady stoppedhim. \n \n \"Pray remain, M. Andre,\" said she; \"you are not at all in the way;besides, I shall have to speak of some one in whom you take a verydeep interest--of Mademoiselle de Mussidan, in short. \n \n \"I never knew such a strange occurrence,\" continued the Viscountess,recovering her spirits rapidly, \"as that to which, my dear Gontran,you owe my visit. Well, I was just going up to dress, for I had beendetained by visitor after visitor, when at two o\u0027clock another camebefore I could give my order, \u0027Not at home.\u0027 This was the Marquis deCroisenois, the brother of the man who twenty years ago disappeared inso mysterious a manner. I hardly knew him at all, though of course wehave met in society, and he bows to me in the Bois, but that is all.\"\"And yet he called on you to-day?\" remarked De Breulh. \n \n \"Don\u0027t interrupt me,\" said the Viscountess. \"Yes, he called, and thatis enough. He is good-looking, faultlessly dressed, and talks well. Hebrought a letter from an old friend of my grandmother\u0027s, theMarchioness d\u0027Arlanges. She is a dear old thing, she uses awfullanguage, and some of her stories are quite too--you know what I mean. \n \n In the letter the old lady said that the Marquis was one of herfriends, and begged me for her sake to do him the service he required. \n \n Of course I asked him to be seated, and assured him that I would doanything that lay in my power. Then he began talking about M. deClinchain, and told me a funny story about that eccentric man and alittle actress, when I heard a great noise in the anteroom. I wasabout to ring and inquire the cause, when the door flew open and incame Van Klopen, the ladies\u0027 tailor, with a very inflamed countenance. \n \n I thought that he had come in a hurry because he had hit on somethingextremely fetching and wished me to be the first to see it. But do youknow what the impudent fellow wanted?\"A smile shone in De Breulh\u0027s eyes, as he answered,--\"Money, perhaps!\"\"You are right,\" returned the Viscountess, gravely; \"he brought mybill into my very drawing-room, and handed it in before a stranger. Inever thought that a man who supplies the most aristocratic portion ofsociety could have been guilty of such a piece of impertinence. Iordered him to leave the room, taking it for granted that he would doso with an apology, but I was wrong. He flew into a rage andthreatened me, and swore that if I did not settle the bill on thespot, he would go to my husband. The bill was nearly twenty thousandfrancs; imagine my horror! I was so thunderstruck at the amount that Iabsolutely entreated him to give me time. But my humility added to hisannoyance, and taking a seat in an armchair, he declared that he wouldnot move from it until he received his money, or had seen my husband.\"\"What was Croisenois doing all this time?\" asked M. de Breulh. \n \n \"He did nothing at first, but at this last piece of audacity he tookout his pocketbook, and throwing it in Van Klopen\u0027s face, said: \u0027Payyourself, you insolent scoundrel, and get out of this.\u0027 \"\"And the tailor went off?\"\"No. \u0027I must give you a receipt,\u0027 said he, and taking writingmaterials from his pocket, he wrote at the foot of the bill, \u0027Receivedfrom the Marquis de Croisenois, on account of money owing by theViscountess de Bois Arden, the sum of twenty thousand francs.\u0027 \"\"Well,\" said De Breulh, looking very grave, \"and after Van Klopen\u0027sdeparture, I suppose Croisenois remained to ask the favor regardingwhich he had called?\"\"You are mistaken,\" answered his cousin. \"I had great difficulty inmaking him speak; but at last he confessed that he was deeply in lovewith Mademoiselle de Mussidan, and entreated me to present him to herparents and exert all my influence in his behalf.\"Both the young men started. \n \n \"That is the man!\" cried they. \n \n \"What do you mean?\" asked the Viscountess, looking from one to theother. \n \n \"That your Marquis de Croisenois is a despicable scoundrel, who hadimposed upon the Marchioness d\u0027Arlanges. Just you listen to ourreasons for coming to this conclusion.\" And with the most perfectclearness De Breulh had the whole state of the case before theViscountess. \n \n The lady listened attentively, and then said,--\"Your premises are wrong; just let me say a word on the matter. Yousay that there is some man who by means of the influence that heexercises over the Count and Countess, can coerce them into grantinghim Sabine\u0027s hand. But, my dear Gontran, an utter stranger to thefamily could not exercise this power. Now M. de Croisenois has neverentered the doors of the house, and came to me to ask for anintroduction.\"The justness of this remark silenced De Breulh, but Andre took anotherview of the matter. \n \n \"This seems all right at a first glance, but still, after theextraordinary scene that the Viscountess has described, I should liketo ask a few questions. Was not Van Klopen\u0027s behavior veryunexpected?\"\"It was brutal and infamous.\"\"Are you not one of his best customers?\"\"I am, and I have spent an enormous sum with him.\"\"But Van Klopen is nasty sometimes; did he not sue Mademoiselle deRiversac?\" asked De Breulh. \n \n \"But he did not, I expect, force his way into her drawing-room andbehave outrageously before a perfect stranger. Do you know M. deCroisenois?\" returned Andre. \n \n \"Very slightly; he is of good family, and his brother George was muchesteemed by all who knew him.\"\"Has he plenty of money?\"\"I do not think so, but in time he will inherit a large fortune; verylikely he is over head and ears in debt.\"\"And yet he had twenty thousand francs in his pocketbook; is not thatrather a large sum to carry when you are simply making a morning call? \n \n and it is curious, too, that it should have been the exact sum wanted. \n \n Then there is another point; the pocketbook was hurled into VanKlopen\u0027s face. Did he submit without a word to such treatment?\"\"He certainly said nothing,\" replied Madame de Bois Arden. \n \n \"One question more, if you please. Did Van Klopen open the book andcount the notes before he gave the receipt?\"The Viscountess thought for a moment. \n \n \"I was a good deal excited,\" said she at length, \"but I am almost surethat I saw no notes in Van Klopen\u0027s hands.\"Andre\u0027s face grew radiant. \n \n \"Good, very good; he was told to pay himself, and yet he never lookedto see if the money was there, but gave a receipt at once. Of course,as Van Klopen kept the pocketbook, the Marquis could have had nothingin it besides the exact sum that was required.\"\"It does seem odd,\" muttered De Breulh. \n \n \"But,\" said Andre, \"your bill was not exactly twenty thousand francs,was it?\"\"No,\" answered the Viscountess. \"I ought to have had change to theamount of a hundred or a hundred and twenty francs, but I suppose hewas too much excited to give it me.\"\"But for all that he could remember that he had writing materials withhim, and give you a receipt?\"The Viscountess was utterly bewildered. \n \n \"And,\" continued Andre, \"how is it that Van Klopen knew De Croisenois\u0027 \n \n name? And now, lastly, where is the receipt?\"Madame de Bois Arden turned very pale and trembled violently. \n \n \"Ah,\" said she, \"I felt sure that something was going to happen, andit was on this very point that I wanted your advice. Well, I have notgot the receipt. M. de Croisenois crumpled it up in his hand and threwit on the table. After a while, however, he took it up and put it inhis pocket.\"\"It is all perfectly clear,\" said Andre in jubilant tones; \"M. deCroisenois had need of your aid, he saw that he could not easilyobtain it, and so sought to bind you by the means of a loan made toyou at a time of great need.\"\"You are right,\" said De Breulh. \n \n The Viscountess\u0027 giddy mode of action had brought her into manyscrapes, but never into so terrible a one as this. \n \n \"Great heavens!\" cried she, \"what do you think that M. de Croisenoiswill do with this receipt?\"\"He will do nothing,\" answered M. de Breulh, \"if you do everything toadvance his suit; but pause for an instant, and he will show the handof steel which has up to now been covered by the velvet glove.\"\"I am not alarmed at a new slander?\" returned the Viscountess. \n \n \"And why not?\" answered De Breulh. \"You know very well that in thesedays of lavish expenditure and unbridled luxury there are many womenin society who are so basely vile that they ruin their lovers with aslittle compunction as their frailer sisters. To-morrow even DeCroisenois may say at the club, \u0027On my word that little Bois Ardencosts me a tremendous lot,\u0027 and hands about this receipt for twentythousand francs. What do you imagine that people will think then?\"\"The world knows me too well to think so ill of me.\"\"No, no, Clotilde, there is no charity in society; they will simplysay that you are his mistress, and finding that the allowance fromyour husband is not enough for your needs, you are ruining your lover. \n \n There will be a significant laugh among the members, and in time, avery short time, the scandal in a highly sensational form will come tothe ears of your husband.\"The Viscountess wrung her hands. \n \n \"It is too horrible,\" wailed she. \"And do you know that Bois Ardenwould put the worst construction on the whole affair, for he declaresthat a woman will sacrifice anything in order to outshine her sex indress. Ah, I will never run up another bill anywhere; tell me,Gontran, what I had better do. Can you not get the receipt from DeCroisenois?\"M. de Breulh paused for a moment and then replied, \"Of course I coulddo so, but such a step would be very damaging to your reputation. Ihave no proof; and if I went to him, he would deny everything ofcourse, and it would make him your enemy for life.\"\"Besides,\" added Andre, \"you would put him on his guard, and he wouldescape us.\"The unhappy woman glanced from one to the other in utter despair. \n \n \"Then I am lost,\" she exclaimed. \"Am I to remain for the rest of mydays in this villain\u0027s power?\"\"Not so,\" returned Andre, \"for I hope soon to put it out of M. deCroisenois\u0027 power to injure any one. What did he say when he asked youto introduce him to the Mussidans?\"\"Nothing pointed.\"\"Then, madame, do not disturb yourself to-night. So long as he hopesyou will be useful, so long he will stay his hand. Do as he wishes;never allude to the receipt; introduce him and speak well of him,while I, aided by M. de Breulh, will do my utmost to unmask thisscoundrel; and as long as he believes himself to be in perfectsecurity, our task will be an easy one.\"Just then the servant returned from the bank, and as soon as the manhad left the room De Breulh took the notes and placed them in hiscousin\u0027s hand. \n \n \"Here is the money for De Croisenois,\" said he. \"Take my advice, andgive it to him this evening with a polite letter of thanks.\"\"A thousand thanks, Gontran; I will act as you advise.\"\"Remember you must not allude in your letter to his introduction tothe Mussidans. What do you think, Andre?\"\"I think a receipt for the money would be a great thing,\" answered he. \n \n \"But such a demand would arouse his suspicions.\"\"I think not, madame, and I see a way of doing it; have you a maidupon whom you could rely?\"\"Yes, I have one.\"\"Good, then give the girl a letter and the notes done up in a separateparcel, and tell her exactly what she is to do. When she sees theMarquis, let her pretend to be alarmed at the great responsibilitythat she is incurring in carrying this large sum, and insist upon areceipt for her own protection.\"\"There is sound sense in that,\" said De Breulh. \n \n \"Yes, yes,\" said the Viscountess, \"Josephine will do--as sharp a girlas you could find in a day\u0027s journey--and will manage the thingadmirably. Trust to me,\" she continued, as a smile of hope spread overher face; \"I will keep De Croisenois in a good humor; he will confidein me, and I will tell you everything. But, oh dear! what shall I dowithout Van Klopen? Why, there is not another man in Paris fit tostand in his shoes.\"With these words the Viscountess rose to leave. \n \n \"I am completely worn out,\" remarked she; \"and I have a dinner-partyto-night. Good-bye then, until we meet again;\" and with her spiritsevidently as joyous as ever, she tripped into her carriage. \n \n \"Now,\" said Andre, as soon as they were once more alone, \"we are onthe track of De Croisenois. He evidently holds Madame de Mussidan ashe holds Madame de Bois Arden. His is a really honorable mode ofaction; he surprises a secret, and then turns extortioner.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/935/28349.html","bookId":269,"book":{"id":269,"title":"Caught In The Net 落网","description":"简介： Emile Gaboriau (1833-1873) is an important figure in the history of detective fiction.
