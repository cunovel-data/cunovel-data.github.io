{"id":8130,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5 A FORGOTTEN CRIME.","content":"　　5Baptiste Mascarin had been in so many strange situations, from whichhe had extricated himself with safety and credit, that he had thefullest self-confidence, but as he ascended the wide staircase of theHotel de Mussidan, he felt his heart beat quicker in anticipation ofthe struggle that was before him. It was twilight out of doors, butall within was a blaze of light. The library into which he was usheredwas a vast apartment, furnished in severe taste. At the sound of theunaristocratic name of Mascarin, which seemed as much out of place asa drunkard\u0027s oath in the chamber of sleeping innocence, M. de Mussidanraised his head in sudden surprise. The Count was seated at the otherend of the room, reading by the light of four candles placed in amagnificently wrought candelabra. He threw down his paper, and raisinghis glasses, gazed with astonishment at Mascarin, who, with his hat inhis hand and his heart in his mouth, slowly crossed the room,muttering a few unintelligible apologies. He could make nothing,however, of his visitor, and said, \"Whom do you wish to see, sir?\"\"The Count de Mussidan,\" stuttered Mascarin; \"and I hope that you willforgive this intrusion.\"The Count cut his excuse short with a haughty wave of his hand. \"Wait,\" said he imperiously. He then with evident pain rose from hisseat, and crossing the room, rang the bell violently, and thenreseated himself. Mascarin, who still remained in the centre of theroom, inwardly wondered if after all he was to be turned out of thehouse. In another second the door opened, and the figure of thefaithful Florestan appeared. \"Florestan,\" said the Count, angrily, \"this is the first time that youhave permitted any one to enter this room without my permission; ifthis occurs again, you leave my service.\"\"I assure your lordship,\" began the man. \"Enough! I have spoken; you know what to expect.\"During this brief colloquy, Mascarin studied the Count with thedeepest attention. The Count Octave de Mussidan in no way resembled the man sketched byFlorestan. Since the time of Montaigne, a servant\u0027s portrait of hisemployer should always be distrusted. The Count looked fully sixty,though he was but fifty years of age; he was undersized, and he lookedshrunk and shrivelled; he was nearly bald, and his long whiskers wereperfectly white. The cares of life had imprinted deep furrows on hisbrow, and told too plainly the story of a man who, having drained thechalice of life to the bottom, was now ready to shiver the goblet. AsFlorestan left the room the Count turned to Mascarin, and in the sameglacial tone observed, \"And now, sir, explain this intrusion.\"Mascarin had often been rebuffed, but never so cruelly as this. Hisvanity was sorely wounded, for he was vain, as all are who think thatthey possess some hidden influence, and he felt his temper giving way. \"Pompous idiot!\" thought he; \"we will see how he looks in a shorttime;\" but his face did not betray this, and his manner remainedcringing and obsequious. \"You have heard my name, my lord, and I am ageneral business agent.\"The Count was deceived by the honest accents which long practice hadtaught Mascarin to use, and he had neither a suspicion nor apresentiment. \"Ah!\" said he majestically, \"a business agent, are you? I presume youcome on behalf of one of my creditors. Well, sir, as I have beforetold these people, your errand is a futile one. Why do they worry mewhen I unhesitatingly pay the extravagant interest they are pleased todemand? They know that they are all knaves. They are aware that I amrich, for I have inherited a great fortune, which is certainly withoutencumbrance; for though I could raise a million to-morrow upon myestates in Poitiers, I have up to this time not chosen to do so.\"Mascarin had at length so recovered his self-command that he listenedto this speech without a word, hoping to gain some information fromit. \"You may tell this,\" continued the Count, \"to those by whom you areemployed.\"\"Excuse me, my lord--\"\"But what?\"\"I cannot allow--\"\"I have nothing more to say; all will be settled as I promised, when Ipay my daughter\u0027s dowry. You are aware that she will shortly be unitedto M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"There was no mistaking the order to go, contained in these words, butMascarin did not offer to do so, but readjusting his spectacles,remarked in a perfectly calm voice,--\"It is this marriage that has brought me here.\"The Count thought that his ears had deceived him. \"What are yousaying?\" said he. \"I say,\" repeated the agent, \"that I am sent to you in connection withthis same marriage.\"Neither the doctor nor Florestan had exaggerated the violence of theCount\u0027s temper. Upon hearing his daughter\u0027s name and marriagementioned by this man, his face grew crimson and his eyes gleamed witha lurid fire. \"Get out of this!\" cried he, angrily. But this was an order that Mascarin had no intention of obeying. \"I assure you that what I have to say is of the utmost importance,\"said he. This speech put the finishing touch to the Count\u0027s fury. \"You won\u0027t go, won\u0027t you?\" said he; and in spite of the pain that atthe moment evidently oppressed him, he stepped to the bell, but wasarrested by Mascarin, uttering in a warning voice the words,--\"Take care; if you ring that bell, you will regret it to the last dayof your life.\"This was too much for the Count\u0027s patience, and letting go the bellrope, he snatched up a walking cane that was leaning against thechimneypiece, and made a rush toward his visitor. But Mascarin did notmove or lift his hand in self-defence, contenting himself with sayingcalmly,--\"No violence, Count; remember Montlouis.\"At this name the Count grew livid, and dropping the cane from hisnerveless hand staggered back a pace or two. Had a spectre suddenlystood up before him with threatening hand, he could not have been morehorrified. \"Montlouis!\" he murmured; \"Montlouis!\"But now Mascarin, thoroughly assured of the value of his weapon, hadresumed all his humbleness of demeanor. \"Believe me, my lord,\" said he, \"that I only mentioned this name onaccount of the immediate danger that threatens you.\"The Count hardly seemed to pay attention to his visitor\u0027s words. \"It was not I,\" continued Mascarin, \"who devised the project ofbringing against you an act which was perhaps a mere accident. I amonly a plenipotentiary from persons I despise, to you, for whom Ientertain the very highest respect.\"By this time the Count had somewhat recovered himself. \"I really do not understand you,\" said he, in a tone he vainlyendeavored to render calm. \"My sudden emotion is only too easilyexplained. I had a sad misfortune. I accidentally shot my secretary,and the poor young man bore the name you just now mentioned; but thecourt acquitted me of all blame in the matter.\"The smile upon Mascarin\u0027s face was so full of sarcasm that the Countbroke off. \"Those who sent me here,\" remarked the agent, slowly, \"are wellacquainted with the evidence produced in court; but unfortunately,they know the real facts, which certain honorable gentlemen had senseto conceal at any risk.\"Again the Count started, but Mascarin went on implacably,--\"But reassure yourself, your friend did not betray you voluntarily. Providence, in her inscrutable decrees----\"The Count shuddered. \"In short, sir, in short----\"Up to this time Mascarin had remained standing, but now that he sawthat his position was fully established, he drew up a chair and satdown. The Count grew more livid at this insolent act, but made nocomment, and this entirely removed any doubts from the agent\u0027s mind. \"The event to which I have alluded has two eye-witnesses, the Baron deClinchain, and a servant, named Ludovic Trofin, now in the employ ofthe Count du Commarin.\"\"I did not know what had become of Trofin.\"\"Perhaps not, but my people do. When he swore to keep the mattersecret, he was unmarried, but a few years later, having entered thebonds of matrimony, he told all to his young wife. This woman turnedout badly; she had several lovers, and through one of them the mattercame to my employer\u0027s ears.\"\"And it was on the word of a lackey, and the gossip of a dissolutewoman, that they have dared to accuse me.\"No word of direct accusation had passed, and yet the Count sought todefend himself. Mascarin saw all this, and smiled inwardly, as he replied, \"We haveother evidence than that of Ludovic.\"\"But,\" said the Count, who was sure of the fidelity of his friend,\"you do not, I suppose, pretend that the Baron de Clinchain hasdeceived me?\"The state of mental anxiety and perturbation into which this man ofthe world had been thrown must have been very intense for him not tohave perceived that every word he uttered put a fresh weapon in hisadversary\u0027s hands. \"He has not denounced you by word of mouth,\" replied the agent. \"Hehas done far more; he has written his testimony.\"\"It is a lie,\" exclaimed the Count. Mascarin was not disturbed by this insult. \"The Baron has written,\" repeated he, \"though he never thought thatany eye save his own would read what he had penned. As you are aware,the Baron de Clinchain is a most methodical man, and punctilious to adegree.\"\"I allow that; continue.\"\"Consequently you will not be surprised to learn that from hisearliest years he has kept a diary, and each day he puts down in themost minute manner everything that has occurred, even to the differentconditions of his bodily health.\"The Count knew of his friend\u0027s foible, and remembered that when theywere young many a practical joke had been played upon his friend onthis account, and now he began to perceive the dangerous ground uponwhich he stood. \"On hearing the facts of the case from Ludovic\u0027s wife\u0027s lover,\"continued Mascarin, \"my employers decided that if the tale was a trueone, some mention of it would be found in the Baron\u0027s diary; andthanks to the ingenuity and skill of certain parties, they have had intheir possession for twenty-four hours the volume for the year 1842.\"\"Scoundrels!\" muttered the Count. \"They find not only one, but three distinct statements relating to theaffair in question.\"The Count started again to his feet with so menacing a look, that theworthy Mascarin pushed back his chair in anticipation of an immediateassault. \"Proofs!\" gasped the Count. \"Give me proofs.\"\"Everything has been provided for, and the three leaves by which youare so deeply compromised have been cut from the book.\"\"Where are these pages?\"Mascarin at once put on an air of injured innocence. \"I have not seen them, but the leaves have been photographed, and aprint has been entrusted to me, in order to enable you to recognizethe writing.\"As he spoke he produced three specimens of the photographic art,wonderfully clear and full of fidelity. The Count examined them withthe utmost attention, and then in a voice which trembled with emotion,he said, \"True enough, it is his handwriting.\"Not a line upon Mascarin\u0027s face indicated the delight with which hereceived this admission. \"Before continuing the subject,\" he observed placidly, \"I consider itnecessary for you to understand the position taken up by the Baron deClinchain. Do you wish, my lord, to read these extracts, or shall I doso for you?\"\"Read,\" answered the Count, adding in a lower voice, \"I cannot see todo so.\"Mascarin drew his chair nearer to the lights on the table. \"Iperceive,\" said he, \"that the first entry was made on the eveningafter the--well, the accident. This is it: \u0027October 26, 1842. Earlythis morning went out shooting with Octave de Mussidan. We wereaccompanied by Ludovic, a groom, and by a young man named Montlouis,whom Octave intends one day to make his steward. It was a splendidday, and by twelve o\u0027clock I had killed a leash of hares. Octave wasin excellent spirits, and by one o\u0027clock we were in a thick cover notfar from Bevron. I and Ludovic were a few yards in front of theothers, when angry voices behind attracted our attention. Octave andMontlouis were arguing violently, and all at once the Count struck hisfuture steward a violent blow. In another moment Montlouis came up tome. \"What is the matter?\" cried I. Instead of replying to my question,the unhappy young man turned back to his master, uttering a series ofthreats. Octave had evidently been reproaching him for some lowintrigue he had been engaged in, and was reflecting upon the characterof the woman. \"At any rate,\" cried Montlouis, \"she is quite asvirtuous as Madame de Mussidan was before her marriage.\"\" \u0027As Octave heard these words, he raised the loaded gun he held inhis hand and fired. Montlouis fell to the ground, bathed in blood. Weall ran up to him, but he was quite dead, for the charge of shot hadpenetrated his heart. I was almost beside myself, but Octave\u0027s despairwas terrible to witness. Tearing his hair, he knelt beside the deadman. Ludovic, however, maintained his calmness. \"We must say that itwas an accident,\" observed he quickly. \"Thinking that Montlouis wasnot near, my master fired into cover.\"\" \u0027This was agreed to, and we carefully arranged what we should say. It was I who went before the magistrate and made a deposition, whichwas unhesitatingly received. But, oh, what a fearful day! My pulse isat eighty, and I feel I shall not sleep all night. Octave is half mad,and Heaven knows what will become of him.\u0027 \"The Count, from the depths of his armchair, listened without apparentemotion to this terrible revelation. He was quite crushed, and wassearching for some means to exorcise the green spectre of the past,which had so suddenly confronted him. Mascarin never took his eyes offhim. All at once the Count roused himself from his prostration, as aman awakes from a hideous dream. \"This is sheer folly,\" cried he. \"It is folly,\" answered Mascarin, \"that would carry much weight withit.\"\"And suppose I were to show you,\" returned the Count, \"that all theseentries are the offspring of a diseased mind?\"Mascarin shook his head with an air of affected grief. \"There is nouse, my lord, in indulging in vain hopes. We,\" he continued, wishingto associate himself with the Count, \"we might of course admit thatthe Baron de Clinchain had made this entry in his diary in a moment oftemporary insanity, were it not for the painful fact that there wereothers. Le me read them.\"\"Go on; I am all attention.\"\"We find the following, three days later: \u0027Oct. 29th, 1842. I am mostuneasy about my health. I feel shooting pains in all my joints. Thederangement of my system arises entirely from this business ofOctave\u0027s. I had to run the gauntlet of a second court, and the judge\u0027seyes seemed to look me through and through. I also saw with much alarmthat my second statement differs somewhat from the first one, so Ihave now learned it by heart. Ludovic is a sharp fellow, and quiteself-possessed. I would like to have him in my household. I keepmyself shut up in my house for fear of meeting friends who want tohear all the details of the accident. I believe I may say that I haverepeated the story more than a couple of dozen times.\u0027 Now, my lord,\"added Mascarin, \"what do you say to this?\"\"Continue the reading of the extracts.\"\"The third allusion, though it is short, is still very important: \u0027November 3rd, 1842. Thank Heaven! all is over. I have just returnedfrom the court. Octave has been acquitted. Ludovic had behavedwonderfully. He explained the reason of the misadventure in a way thatwas really surprising in an uneducated man, and there was not an atomof suspicion among judge, jury, or spectators. I have changed my mind;I would not have a fellow like Ludovic in my service; he is much toosharp. When I had been duly sworn, I gave my evidence. Though I wasmuch agitated, I went through it all right; but when I got home I feltvery ill, and discovered that my pulse was down to fifty. Ah, me! whatterrible misfortunes are wrought by a momentary burst of anger. I nowwrite this sentence in my diary: /\"Never give way to firstimpulses.\"/\u0027 These words,\" continued Mascarin, \"were inscribed onevery one of the pages following,--at least so those who examined theentries informed me.\"Mascarin persisted in representing himself as the agent of others, butstill the Count made no allusion to the persons in the background. After a few moments the Count rose and limped up and down, as thoughhe hoped by this means to collect his ideas, or perhaps in order toprevent his visitor from scanning his face too closely. \"Have you done?\" asked he, all at once. \"Yes, my lord.\"\"Have you thought what an impartial judge would say?\"\"I think I have.\"\"He would say,\" broke in the Count, \"that no sane man would havewritten such things down, for there are certain secrets which we donot whisper even to ourselves, and it is hardly likely that any manwould make such compromising entries in a diary which might be lost orstolen, and which would certainly be read by his heir. Do you thinkthat a man of high position would record his perjury, which is a crimethat would send him to penal servitude?\"Mascarin gazed upon the Count with an air of pity. \"You are not going the right way, my lord, to get out of your trouble. No lawyer would adopt your theory. If the remaining volumes of M. deClinchain\u0027s diaries were produced in court, I imagine that otherequally startling entries would be found in them.\"The Count now appeared to have arrived at some decision, and tocontinue the conversation simply for the purpose of gaining time. \"Well,\" said he, \"I will give up this idea; but how do I know thatthese documents are not forgeries? Nowadays, handwritings are easilyfacsimilied, when even bankers find it hard to distinguish betweentheir own notes and counterfeit ones.\"\"That can be settled by seeing if certain leaves are missing from theBaron\u0027s diary.\"\"That does not prove much.\"\"Pardon me, it proves a great deal. This new line of argument, Iassure you, will avail you as little as the other. I am perfectlyaware that the Baron de Clinchain will utter whatever words you mayplace in his mouth. Let us suppose that the leaves which have beentorn out should fit into the book exactly. Would not that be a strongpoint?\"The Count smiled ironically, as though he had a crushing reply inreserve. \"And so this is your opinion, is it?\" said he. \"It is indeed.\"\"Then all I have to do is to plead guilty. I did kill Montlouis, justas Clinchain describes, but----\" and as he spoke he took a heavyvolume from a shelf, and opening it at a certain place laid it beforeMascarin, remarking,--\"this is the criminal code; read. \u0027Allproceedings in criminal law shall be cancelled after a lapse of tenyears.\u0027 \"The Count de Mussidan evidently thought that he had crushed hisadversary by this shattering blow; but it was not so, for instead ofexhibiting any surprise, Mascarin\u0027s smile was as bland as ever. \"I, too, know a little of the law,\" said he. \"The very first day thismatter was brought to me, I turned to this page and read what you havejust shown me to my employers.\"\"And what did they say?\"\"That they knew all this, but that you would be glad to compromise theaffair, even at the expense of half your fortune.\"The agent\u0027s manner was so confident that the Count felt they haddiscovered some means of turning this crime of his early days toadvantage; but he was still sufficiently master of himself to show noemotion. \"No,\" replied he, \"it is not such an easy matter as you think to gethold of half my fortune. I fancy that your friends\u0027 demands willassume a more modest tone, the more so when I repeat that thesemorsels of paper, stolen from my friend\u0027s diary, are absolutelyworthless.\"\"Do you think so?\"\"Certainly, for the law on this matter speaks plainly enough.\"Mascarin readjusted his glasses, a sure indication that he was goingto make an important reply. \"You are quite right, my lord,\" said he, slowly. \"There is nointention of taking you before any court, for there is no penalty nowfor a crime committed twenty-three years ago; but the miserablewretches whom I blush to act for have arranged a plan which will bedisagreeable in the highest degree both for you and the Baron.\"\"Pray tell me what this clever plan is.\"\"Most certainly. I came here to-day for this very purpose. Let usfirst conclude that you have rejected the request with which Iapproached you.\"\"Do you call this style of thing a request?\"\"What is the use of quarrelling over words. Well, to-morrow, myclients--though I am ashamed to speak of them as such--will send to awell known morning paper a tale, with the title, \u0027Story of a Day\u0027sShooting.\u0027 Of course only initials will be used for the names, but nodoubt will exist as to the identity of the actors in the tragedy.\"\"You forget that in actions for libel proofs are not admitted.\"Mascarin shrugged his shoulders. \"My employers forget nothing,\" remarked he; \"and it is upon this verypoint that they have based their plans For this reason they introduceinto the matter a fifth party, of course an accomplice, whose name isintroduced into the story in the paper. Upon the day of itsappearance, this man lodges a complaint against the journal, andinsists on proving in a court of justice, that he did not form one ofthe shooting-party.\"\"Well, what happens then?\"\"Then, my lord, this man insists that the journal should give aretraction of the injurious statement and summons as witnesses bothyourself and the Baron de Clinchain, and as a conclusion, Ludovic; andas he claims damages, he employs a lawyer, who is one of theconfederates and behind the scenes. The lawyer will speak something tothis effect: \u0027That the Count de Mussidan is clearly a murderer; thatthe Baron de Clinchain is a perjurer, as proved by his ownhandwriting; Ludovic has been tampered with, but my client, anhonorable man, must not be classed with these, etc., etc.\u0027 Have I mademyself understood?\"Indeed, he had, and with such cold and merciless logic that it seemedhopeless to expect to escape from the net that had been spread. As these thoughts passed through the Count\u0027s brain, he saw at a glancethe whole terrible notoriety that the case would cause, and societygloating over the details. Yet such was the obstinacy of hisdisposition, and so impatient was he of control, that the moredesperate his position seemed, the fiercer was his resistance. He knewthe world well, and he also knew that the cutthroats who demanded hismoney with threats had every reason to dread the lynx eye of the law. If he refused to listen to them, as his heart urged him, perhaps theywould not dare to carry out their threats. Had he alone been concernedin the matter, he would have resisted to the last, and fought it outto the last drop of his blood, and as a preliminary, would have beatenthe sneering rogue before him to a jelly; but how dared he expose hisfriend Clinchain, who had already braved so much for him? As he pacedup and down the library, these and many other thoughts swept acrosshis brain, and he was undecided whether to submit to these extortionsor throw the agent out of the window. His excited demeanor and theoccasional interjections that burst from his lips showed Mascarin thatthe account of him was not exaggerated, and that when led by passionhe would as soon shoot a fellow-creature as a rabbit. And yet, thoughhe knew not whether he should make his exit by the door or the window,he sat twirling his fingers with the most unconcerned air imaginable. At last the Count gave ear to prudence. He stopped in front of theagent, and, taking no pains to hide his contempt, said,--\"Come, let us make an end of this. How much do you want for thesepapers?\"\"Oh, my lord!\" exclaimed Mascarin; \"surely you do not think that Icould be guilty----?\"M. de Mussidan shrugged his shoulders. \"Pray, do not take me for afool,\" said he, \"but name your sum.\"Mascarin seemed a little embarrassed, and hesitated. \"We don\u0027t wantmoney,\" answered he at length. \"Not money!\" replied the Count. \"We want something that is of no importance to you, but of the utmostvalue to those who despatched me here. I am commissioned to inform youthat my clients desire that you should break off the engagementbetween your daughter and M. de Breulh-Faverlay, and that the missingpaper will be handed to you on the completion of her marriage with anyelse whom you may deem worthy of such an honor.\"This demand, which was utterly unexpected, so astonished the Countthat he could only exclaim, \"Why, this is absolute madness!\"\"No; it is plain, good sense, and a /bona fide/ offer.\"An idea suddenly flashed across the Count\u0027s mind. \"Is it yourintention,\" asked he, \"to furnish me with a son-in-law too?\"\"I am sure, my lord,\" answered Mascarin, looking the picture ofdisinterested honesty, \"that, even to save yourself, you would neversacrifice your daughter.\"\"But--\"\"You are entirely mistaken; it is M. de Breulh-Faverlay whom myclients wish to strike at, for they have taken an oath that he shallnever wed a lady with a million for her dowry.\"So surprised was the Count, that the whole aspect of the interviewseemed to have changed, and he now combated his own objections insteadof those of his unwelcome visitor. \"M. de Breulh-Faverlay has mypromise,\" remarked he; \"but of course it is easy to find a pretext. The Countess, however, is in favor of the match, and the chiefopposition to any change will come from her.\"Mascarin did not think it wise to make any reply, and the Countcontinued, \"My daughter also may not view this rupture withsatisfaction.\"Thanks to the information he had received from Florestan, Mascarinknew how much importance to attach to this. \"Mademoiselle, at her ageand with her tastes, is not likely to have her heart seriouslyengaged.\" For fully a quarter of an hour the Count still hesitated. Heknew that he was entirely at the mercy of those miscreants, and hispride revolted at the idea of submission; but at length he yielded. \"I agree,\" said he. \"My daughter shall not marry M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"Even in his hour of triumph, Mascarin\u0027s face did not change. He bowedprofoundly, and left the room; but as he descended the stairs, herubbed his hands, exclaiming, \"If the doctor has made as good a job ofit as I have, success is certain.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/935/28330.html","bookId":269,"book":{"id":269,"title":"Caught In The Net 落网","description":"简介： Emile Gaboriau (1833-1873) is an important figure in the history of detective fiction.
