{"id":8134,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9 ROSE\u0027S PROMOTION.","content":"　　9As soon as Andre had released her hand, Sabine took off her hat, and,handing it to Modeste, remarked,--\"How am I looking to-day, Andre?\"The young painter hastened to reassure her on this point, and shecontinued in joyous tones,--\"No, I do not want compliments; I want to know if I look the rightthing for sitting for my portrait.\"Sabine was very beautiful, but hers was a different style of beautyfrom that of Rose, whose ripe, sensuous charms were fitted tocaptivate the admiration of the voluptuary, while Sabine was of themost refined and ethereal character. Rose fettered the body withearthly trammels, while Sabine drew the soul heavenward. Her beautywas not of the kind that dazzles, for the air of proud reserve whichshe threw over it, in some slight measure obscured its brilliancy. \n \n She might have passed unnoticed, like the work of a great master\u0027sbrush hanging neglected over the altar of a village church; but whenthe eye had once fathomed that hidden beauty, it never ceased to gazeon it with admiration. She had a broad forehead, covered with a wealthof chestnut hair, soft, lustrous eyes, and an exquisitely chiselledmouth. \n \n \"Alas!\" said Andre, \"when I gaze upon you, I have to confess howimpossible it is to do you justice. Before you came I had fancied thatthe portrait was completed, but now I see that I have only made afailure.\"As he spoke, he drew aside the curtain, and the young girl\u0027s portraitwas revealed. It was by no means a work of extraordinary merit. Theartist was only twenty-four years of age, and had been compelled tointerrupt his studies to toil for his daily bread, but it was full oforiginality and genius. Sabine gazed at it for a few moments insilence, and then murmured the words,--\"It is lovely!\"But Andre was too discouraged to notice her praise. \n \n \"It is like,\" remarked he, \"but a photograph also has that merit. Ihave only got your features, but not your expression; it is an utterfailure. Shall I try again?\"Sabine stopped him with a gesture of denial. \n \n \"You shall not try again,\" said she decidedly. \n \n \"And why not?\" asked he in astonishment. \n \n \"Because this visit will be my last, Andre.\"\"The last?\" stammered the painter. \"In what way have I so offendedyou, that you should inflict so terrible a punishment on me?\"\"I do not wish to punish you. You asked for my portrait, and I yieldedto your request; but let us talk reasonably. Do you not know that I amrisking my reputation by coming here day after day?\"Andre made no reply, for this unexpected blow had almost stunned him. \n \n \"Besides,\" continued Mademoiselle de Mussidan, \"what is to be donewith the portrait? It must be hidden away, as if it were something wewere ashamed of. Remember, on your success hangs our marriage.\"\"I do not forget that.\"\"Hasten then to gain all honor and distinction, for the world mustagree with me in saying that my choice has been a wise one.\"\"I will do so.\"\"I fully believe you, dear Andre, and remember what I said to you ayear ago. Achieve a name, then go to my father and ask for my hand. Ifhe refuses, if my supplications do not move him, I will quit his roofforever.\"\"You are right,\" answered Andre. \"I should indeed by a fool if Isacrificed a future happy life for a few hours of present enjoyment,and I will implicitly--\"\"And now,\" said Sabine, \"that we have agreed on this point, let usdiscuss our mutual interests, of which it seems that we have been alittle negligent up till now.\"Andre at once began to tell her of all that had befallen him sincethey had last met, his defeats and successes. \n \n \"I am in an awkward plight,\" said he. \"Yesterday, that well knowncollector, Prince Crescenzi, came to my studio. One of my picturestook his fancy, and he ordered another from me, for which he would paysix thousand francs.\"\"That was quite a stroke of luck.\"\"Just so, but unfortunately he wants it directly. Then Jean Lamou, whohas more in his hand than he can manage, has offered me the decorationof a palatial edifice that he is building for a great speculator, M. \n \n Gandelu. I am to engage all the workmen, and shall receive some sevenor eight hundred francs a month.\"\"But how does this trouble you?\"\"I will tell you. I have twice seen M. Gandelu, and he wants me tobegin work at once; but I cannot accept both, and must choose betweenthem.\"Sabine reflected. \n \n \"I should execute the Prince\u0027s commission,\" said she. \n \n \"So should I, only----\"The girl easily found the cause of his hesitation. \n \n \"Will you never forget that I am wealthy?\" replied she. \n \n \"The one would bring in the most money,\" he returned, \"and the othermost credit.\"\"Then accept the offer of M. Gandelu.\"The old cuckoo-clock in the corner struck five. \n \n \"Before we part, dear Andre,\" resumed she, \"I must tell you of a freshtrouble which threatens us; there is a project for marrying me to M. \n \n de Breulh-Faverlay.\"\"What, that very wealthy gentleman?\"\"Just so.\"\"Well, if I oppose my father\u0027s wishes, an explanation must ensue, andthis just now I do not desire. I therefore intend to speak openly toM. de Breulh-Faverlay, who is an honorable, straightforward man; andwhen I tell him the real state of the case, he will withdraw hispretensions.\"\"But,\" replied Andre, \"should he do so, another will come forward.\"\"That is very possible, and in his turn the successor will bedismissed.\"\"Ah!\" murmured the unhappy man, \"how terrible will be your life,--ascene of daily strife with your father and mother.\"After a tender farewell, Sabine and Modeste left. Andre had wished tobe permitted to go out and procure a vehicle, but this the young girlnegatived, and took her leave, saying.--\"I shall see M. de Breulh-Faverlay to-morrow.\"For a moment after he was left alone Andre felt very sad, but a happythought flashed across his brain. \n \n \"Sabine,\" said he, \"went away on foot, and I may follow her withoutinjury to her reputation.\"In another moment he was in the street, and caught a glimpse of Sabineand her maid under a lamp at the next corner. He crossed to the otherside of the way and followed them cautiously. \n \n \"Perhaps,\" murmured he, \"the time is not far distant when I shall havethe right to be with her in her walks, and feel her arm pressedagainst mine.\"By this time Sabine and her companion had reached the Rue Blanche, andhailing a cab, were rapidly driven away. Andre gazed after it, and assoon as it was out of sight, decided to return to his work. As hepassed a brilliantly lighted shop, a fresh young voice saluted him. \n \n \"M. Andre, M. Andre.\"He looked up in extreme surprise, and saw a young woman, dressed inthe most extravagant style, standing by the door of a brougham, whichglittered with fresh paint and varnish. In vain he tried to think whoshe could be, but at length his memory served him. \n \n \"Mademoiselle Rose,\" said he, \"or I am much mistaken.\"A shrill, squeaky voice replied, \"Madame Zora Chantemille, if youplease.\"Andre turned sharply round and found himself face to face with a youngman who had completed an order he was giving to the coachman. \n \n \"Ah, is that you?\" said he. \n \n \"Yes, Chantemille is the name of the estate that I intend to settle onmadame.\"The painter examined the personage who had just addressed him withmuch curiosity. He was dressed in the height or rather the burlesqueof fashion, wore an eyeglass, and an enormous locket on his chain. Theface which surmounted all this grandeur was almost that of a monkey,and Toto Chupin had not exaggerated its ugliness when he likened it tothat animal. \n \n \"Pooh,\" cried Rose, \"what matters a name? All you have to do is to askthis gentleman, who is an old friend of mine, to dinner.\" And withoutwaiting for a reply, she took Andre by the hand and led him into abrilliantly lighted hall. \"You must dine with us,\" she exclaimed; \"Iwill take no denial. Come, let me introduce you, M. Andre, M. Gastonde Gandelu. There, that is all settled.\"The man bowed. \n \n \"Andre, Andre,\" repeated Gandelu; \"why, the name is familiar to me,--and so is the face. Have I not met you at my father\u0027s house? Come in;we intend to have a jovial evening.\"\"I really cannot,\" pleaded Andre. \"I have an engagement.\"\"Throw it over then; we intend to keep you, now that we have got you.\"Andre hesitated for a moment, but he felt dispirited, and that herequired rousing. \"After all,\" thought he, \"why should I refuse? Ifthis young man\u0027s friends are like himself, the evening will be anamusing one.\"\"Come up,\" cried Rose, placing her foot upon the stairs. Andre wasabout to follow her, but was held back by Gandelu, whose face wasradiant with delight. \n \n \"Was there ever such a girl?\" whispered he; \"but there, don\u0027t jump atconclusions. I have only had her in hand for a short time, but I am areal dab at starting a woman grandly, and it would be hard to find myequal in Paris, you may bet.\"\"That can be seen at a glance,\" answered Andre, concealing a smile. \n \n \"Well, look here, I began at once. Zora is a quaint name, is it not? \n \n It was my invention. She isn\u0027t a right down swell to-day, but I haveordered six dresses for her from Van Klopen; such swell gets up! Youknow Van Klopen, don\u0027t you, the best man-milliner in Paris. Suchtaste! such ideas! you never saw the like.\"Rose had by this time reached her drawing-room. \"Andre,\" said she,impatiently, \"are you never coming up?\"\"Quick, quick,\" said Gandelu, \"let us go at once; if she gets into atemper she is sure to have a nervous attack, so let us hurry up.\"Rose did all she could to dazzle Andre, and as a commencementexhibited to him her domestics, a cook and a maid; then he was shownevery article of furniture, and not one was spared him. He was forcedto admire the drawing-room suite covered with old gold silk, trimmedblue, and to test the thickness of the curtains. Bearing aloft a largecandelabra, and covering himself with wax, Gandelu led the way,telling them the price of everything like an energetic tradesman. \n \n \"That clock,\" said he, \"cost me a hundred louis, and dirt cheap at theprice. How funny that you should have known my father! Has he not awonderful intellect? That flower stand was three hundred francs,absolutely given away. Take care of the governor, he is as sharp as aneedle. He wanted me to have a profession, but no, thank you. Yes,that occasional table was a bargain at twenty louis. Six months ago Ithought that the old man would have dropped off, but now the doctorssay--\" He stopped suddenly, for a loud noise was heard in thevestibule. \"Here come the fellows I invited,\" cried he, and placingthe candelabra on the table, he hurried from the room. \n \n Andre was delighted at so grand an opportunity of studying the /genus/masher. Rose felt flattered by the admiration her fine rooms evidentlycaused. \n \n \"You see,\" cried she, \"I have left Paul; he bothered me awfully, andended by half starving me.\"\"Why, you are joking; he came here to-day, and said he was earningtwelve thousand francs a year.\"\"Twelve thousand humbugs. A fellow that will take five hundred francsfrom an old scarecrow he never met before is--\"Rose broke off abruptly, for at that moment young Gandelu brought inhis friends, and introduced them; they were all of the same type astheir host, and Andre was about to study them more intently, when awhite-waistcoated waiter threw open the door, exclaiming pompously,\"Madame, the dinner is on the table.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/935/28334.html","bookId":269,"book":{"id":269,"title":"Caught In The Net 落网","description":"简介： Emile Gaboriau (1833-1873) is an important figure in the history of detective fiction.
