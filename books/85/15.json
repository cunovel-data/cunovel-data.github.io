{"id":2234,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15 Piltchard \u0026 Wren","content":"Captain Piltchard and Captain Wren, the inoffensive joint squadron operations officers, were both mild, soft-spoken men of less than middle height who enjoyed flying combat missions and begged nothing more of life andColonel Cathcart than the opportunity to continue flying them. They had flown hundreds of combat missions andwanted to fly hundreds more. They assigned themselves to every one. Nothing so wonderful as war had everhappened to them before; and they were afraid it might never happen to them again. They conducted their dutieshumbly and reticently, with a minimum of fuss, and went to great lengths not to antagonize anyone. They smiledquickly at everyone they passed. When they spoke, they mumbled. They were shifty, cheerful, subservient menwho were comfortable only with each other and never met anyone else’s eye, not even Yossarian’s eye at theopen-air meeting they called to reprimand him publicly for making Kid Sampson turn back from the mission toBologna. 　　“Fellas,” said Captain Piltchard, who had thinning dark hair and smiled awkwardly. “When you turn back from amission, try to make sure it’s for something important, will you? Not for something unimportant... like adefective intercom... or something like that. Okay? Captain Wren has more he wants to say to you on thatsubject.” 　　“Captain Piltchard’s right, fellas,” said Captain Wren. “And that’s all I’m going to say to you on that subject. 　　Well, we finally got to Bologna today, and we found out it’s a milk run. We were all a little nervous, I guess, anddidn’t do too much damage. Well, listen to this. Colonel Cathcart got permission for us to go back. Andtomorrow we’re really going to paste those ammunition dumps. Now, what do you think about that?” 　　And to prove to Yossarian that they bore him no animosity, they even assigned him to fly lead bombardier withMcWatt in the first formation when they went back to Bologna the next day. He came in on the target like aHavermeyer, confidently taking no evasive action at all, and suddenly they were shooting the living shit out ofhim! 　　Heavy flak was everywhere! He had been lulled, lured and trapped, and there was nothing he could do but sitthere like an idiot and watch the ugly black puffs smashing up to kill him. There was nothing he could do untilhis bombs dropped but look back into the bombsight, where the fine cross-hairs in the lens were gluedmagnetically over the target exactly where he had placed them, intersecting perfectly deep inside the yard of hisblock of camouflaged warehouses before the base of the first building. He was trembling steadily as the planecrept ahead. He could hear the hollow boom-boom-boom-boom of the flak pounding all around him inoverlapping measures of four, the sharp, piercing crack! of a single shell exploding suddenly very close by. Hishead was bursting with a thousand dissonant impulses as he prayed for the bombs to drop. He wanted to sob. Theengines droned on monotonously like a fat, lazy fly. At last the indices on the bombsight crossed, tripping awaythe eight 500-pounders one after the other. The plane lurched upward buoyantly with the lightened load. 　　Yossarian bent away from the bombsight crookedly to watch the indicator on his left. When the pointer touchedzero, he closed the bomb bay doors and, over the intercom, at the very top of his voice, shrieked: 　　“Turn right hard!” 　　McWatt responded instantly. With a grinding howl of engines, he flipped the plane over on one wing and wrungit around remorselessly in a screaming turn away from the twin spires of flak Yossarian had spied stabbingtoward them. Then Yossarian had McWatt climb and keep climbing higher and higher until they tore free finallyinto a calm, diamond-blue sky that was sunny and pure everywhere and laced in the distance with long whiteveils of tenuous fluff. The wind strummed soothingly against the cylindrical panes of his windows, and herelaxed exultantly only until they picked up speed again and then turned McWatt left and plunged him right backdown, noticing with a transitory spasm of elation the mushrooming clusters of flak leaping open high above himand back over his shoulder to the right, exactly where he could have been if he had not turned left and dived. Heleveled McWatt out with another harsh cry and whipped him upward and around again into a ragged blue patchof unpolluted air just as the bombs he had dropped began to strike. The first one fell in the yard, exactly where hehad aimed, and then the rest of the bombs from his own plane and from the other planes in his flight burst openon the ground in a charge of rapid orange flashes across the tops of the buildings, which collapsed instantly in avast, churning wave of pink and gray and coal-black smoke that went rolling out turbulently in all directions andquaked convulsively in its bowels as though from great blasts of red and white and golden sheet lightning. 　　“Well, will you look at that,” Aarfy marveled sonorously right beside Yossarian, his plump, orbicular facesparkling with a look of bright enchantment. “There must have been an ammunition dump down there.” 　　Yossarian had forgotten about Aarfy. “Get out!” he shouted at him. “Get out of the nose!” 　　Aarfy smiled politely and pointed down toward the target in a generous invitation for Yossarian to look. 　　Yossarian began slapping at him insistently and signaled wildly toward the entrance of the crawlway. 　　“Get back in the ship!” he cried frantically. “Get back in the ship!” 　　Aarfy shrugged amiably. “I can’t hear you,” he explained. 　　Yossarian seized him by the straps of his parachute harness and pushed him backward toward the crawlway justas the plane was hit with a jarring concussion that rattled his bones and made his heart stop. He knew at oncethey were all dead. 　　“Climb!” he screamed into the intercom at McWatt when he saw he was still alive. “Climb, you bastard! Climb,climb, climb, climb!” 　　The plane zoomed upward again in a climb that was swift and straining, until he leveled it out with another harshshout at McWatt and wrenched it around once more in a roaring, merciless forty-five-degree turn that sucked hisinsides out in one enervating sniff and left him floating fleshless in mid-air until he leveled McWatt out againjust long enough to hurl him back around toward the right and then down into a screeching dive. Throughendless blobs of ghostly black smoke he sped, the hanging smut wafting against the smooth plexiglass nose ofthe ship like an evil, damp, sooty vapor against his cheeks. His heart was hammering again in aching terror as he hurtled upward and downward through the blind gangs of flak charging murderously into the sky at him, thensagging inertly. Sweat gushed from his neck in torrents and poured down over his chest and waist with thefeeling of warm slime. He was vaguely aware for an instant that the planes in his formation were no longer there,and then he was aware of only himself. His throat hurt like a raw slash from the strangling intensity with whichhe shrieked each command to McWatt. The engines rose to a deafening, agonized, ululating bellow each timeMcWatt changed direction. And far out in front the bursts of flak were still swarming into the sky from newbatteries of guns poking around for accurate altitude as they waited sadistically for him to fly into range. 　　The plane was slammed again suddenly with another loud, jarring explosion that almost rocked it over on itsback, and the nose filled immediately with sweet clouds of blue smoke. Something was on fire! Yossarianwhirled to escape and smacked into Aarfy, who had struck a match and was placidly lighting his pipe. Yossariangaped at his grinning, moon-faced navigator in utter shock and confusion. It occurred to him that one of themwas mad. 　　“Jesus Christ!” he screamed at Aarfy in tortured amazement. “Get the hell out of the nose! Are you crazy? Getout!” 　　“What?” said Aarfy. 　　“Get out!” Yossarian yelled hysterically, and began clubbing Aarfy backhanded with both fists to drive himaway. “Get out!” 　　“I still can’t hear you,” Aarfy called back innocently with an expression of mild and reproving perplexity. 　　“You’ll have to talk a little louder.” 　　“Get out of the nose!” Yossarian shrieked in frustration. “They’re trying to kill us! Don’t you understand? 　　They’re trying to kill us!” 　　“Which way should I go, goddam it?” McWatt shouted furiously over the intercom in a suffering, high-pitchedvoice. “Which way should I go?” 　　“Turn left! Left, you goddam dirty son of a bitch! Turn left hard!” 　　Aarfy crept up close behind Yossarian and jabbed him sharply in the ribs with the stem of his pipe. Yossarianflew up toward the ceiling with a whinnying cry, then jumped completely around on his knees, white as a sheetand quivering with rage. Aarfy winked encouragingly and jerked his thumb back toward McWatt with ahumorous moue. 　　“What’s eating him?” he asked with a laugh. 　　Yossarian was struck with a weird sense of distortion. “Will you get out of here?” he yelped beseechingly, andshoved Aarfy over with all his strength. “Are you deaf or something? Get back in the plane!” And to McWatt hescreamed, “Dive! Dive!” 　　Down they sank once more into the crunching, thudding, voluminous barrage of bursting antiaircraft shells asAarfy came creeping back behind Yossarian and jabbed him sharply in the ribs again. Yossarian shied upwardwith another whinnying gasp. 　　“I still couldn’t hear you,” Aarfy said. 　　“I said get out of here!” Yossarian shouted, and broke into tears. He began punching Aarfy in the body with bothhands as hard as he could. “Get away from me! Get away!” 　　Punching Aarfy was like sinking his fists into a limp sack of inflated rubber. There was no resistance, noresponse at all from the soft, insensitive mass, and after a while Yossarian’s spirit died and his arms droppedhelplessly with exhaustion. He was overcome with a humiliating feeling of impotence and was ready to weep inself-pity. 　　“What did you say?” Aarfy asked. 　　“Get away from me,” Yossarian answered, pleading with him now. “Go back in the plane.” 　　“I still can’t hear you.” 　　“Never mind,” wailed Yossarian, “never mind. Just leave me alone.” 　　“Never mind what?” 　　Yossarian began hitting himself in the forehead. He seized Aarfy by the shirt front and, struggling to his feet fortraction, dragged him to the rear of the nose compartment and flung him down like a bloated and unwieldy bag inthe entrance of the crawlway. A shell banged open with a stupendous clout right beside his ear as he wasscrambling back toward the front, and some undestroyed recess of his intelligence wondered that it did not killthem all. They were climbing again. The engines were howling again as though in pain, and the air inside theplane was acrid with the smell of machinery and fetid with the stench of gasoline. The next thing he knew, it wassnowing! 　　Thousands of tiny bits of white paper were falling like snowflakes inside the plane, milling around his head sothickly that they clung to his eyelashes when he blinked in astonishment and fluttered against his nostrils and lipseach time he inhaled. When he spun around in his bewilderment, Aarfy was grinning proudly from ear to ear likesomething inhuman as he held up a shattered paper map for Yossarian to see. A large chunk of flak had rippedup from the floor through Aarfy’s colossal jumble of maps and had ripped out through the ceiling inches awayfrom their heads. Aarfy’s joy was sublime. 　　“Will you look at this?” he murmured, waggling two of his stubby fingers playfully into Yossarian’s facethrough the hole in one of his maps. “Will you look at this?” 　　Yossarian was dumbfounded by his state of rapturous contentment. Aarfy was like an eerie ogre in a dream,incapable of being bruised or evaded, and Yossarian dreaded him for a complex of reasons he was too petrifiedto untangle. Wind whistling up through the jagged gash in the floor kept the myriad bits of paper circulating likealabaster particles in a paperweight and contributed to a sensation of lacquered, waterlogged unreality. 　　Everything seemed strange, so tawdry and grotesque. His head was throbbing from a shrill clamor that drilledrelentlessly into both ears. It was McWatt, begging for directions in an incoherent frenzy. Yossarian continuedstaring in tormented fascination at Aarfy’s spherical countenance beaming at him so serenely and vacantlythrough the drifting whorls of white paper bits and concluded that he was a raving lunatic just as eight bursts offlak broke open successively at eye level off to the right, then eight more, and then eight more, the last grouppulled over toward the left so that they were almost directly in front. 　　“Turn left hard!” he hollered to McWatt, as Aarfy kept grinning, and McWatt did turn left hard, but the flakturned left hard with them, catching up fast, and Yossarian hollered, “I said hard, hard, hard, hard, you bastard,hard!” 　　And McWatt bent the plane around even harder still, and suddenly, miraculously, they were out of range. Theflak ended. The guns stopped booming at them. And they were alive. 　　Behind him, men were dying. Strung out for miles in a stricken, tortuous, squirming line, the other flights ofplanes were making the same hazardous journey over the target, threading their swift way through the swollenmasses of new and old bursts of flak like rats racing in a pack through their own droppings. One was on fire, andflapped lamely off by itself, billowing gigantically like a monstrous blood-red star. As Yossarian watched, theburning plane floated over on its side and began spiraling down slowly in wide, tremulous, narrowing circles, itshuge flaming burden blazing orange and flaring out in back like a long, swirling cape of fire and smoke. Therewere parachutes, one, two, three... four, and then the plane gyrated into a spin and fell the rest of the way to theground, fluttering insensibly inside its vivid pyre like a shred of colored tissue paper. One whole flight of planesfrom another squadron had been blasted apart. 　　Yossarian sighed barrenly, his day’s work done. He was listless and sticky. The engines crooned mellifluously asMcWatt throttled back to loiter and allow the rest of the planes in his flight to catch up. The abrupt stillnessseemed alien and artificial, a little insidious. Yossarian unsnapped his flak suit and took off his helmet. He sighedagain, restlessly, and closed his eyes and tried to relax. 　　“Where’s Orr?” someone asked suddenly over his intercom. 　　Yossarian bounded up with a one-syllable cry that crackled with anxiety and provided the only rationalexplanation for the whole mysterious phenomenon of the flak at Bologna: Orr! He lunged forward over thebombsight to search downward through the plexiglass for some reassuring sign of Orr, who drew flak like amagnet and who had undoubtedly attracted the crack batteries of the whole Hermann Goering Division toBologna overnight from wherever the hell they had been stationed the day before when Orr was still in Rome. 　　Aarfy launched himself forward an instant later and cracked Yossarian on the bridge of the nose with the sharprim of his flak helmet. Yossarian cursed him as his eyes flooded with tears. 　　“There he is,” Aarfy orated funereally, pointing down dramatically at a hay wagon and two horses standingbefore the barn of a gray stone farmhouse. “Smashed to bits. I guess their numbers were all up.” 　　Yossarian swore at Aarfy again and continued searching intently, cold with a compassionate kind of fear now forthe little bouncy and bizarre buck-toothed tentmate who had smashed Appleby’s forehead open with a ping-pongracket and who was scaring the daylights out of Yossarian once again. At last Yossarian spotted the two-engined,twin-ruddered plane as it flew out of the green background of the forests over a field of yellow farmland. One ofthe propellers was feathered and perfectly still, but the plane was maintaining altitude and holding a propercourse. Yossarian muttered an unconscious prayer of thankfulness and then flared up at Orr savagely in a rantingfusion of resentment and relief. 　　“That bastard!” he began. “That goddam stunted, red-faced, big-cheeked, curly-headed, buck-toothed rat bastardson of a bitch!” 　　“What?” said Aarfy. 　　“That dirty goddam midget-assed, apple-cheeked, goggle-eyed, undersized, buck-toothed, grinning, crazysonofabitchin-bastard!” Yossarian sputtered. 　　“What?” 　　“Never mind!” 　　“I still can’t hear you,” Aarfy answered. 　　Yossarian swung himself around methodically to face Aarfy. “You prick,” he began. 　　“Me?” 　　“You pompous, rotund, neighborly, vacuous, complacent...” 　　Aarfy was unperturbed. Calmly he struck a wooden match and sucked noisily at his pipe with an eloquent air ofbenign and magnanimous forgiveness. He smiled sociably and opened his mouth to speak. Yossarian put hishand over Aarfy’s mouth and pushed him away wearily. He shut his eyes and pretended to sleep all the way backto the field so that he would not have to listen to Aarfy or see him. 　　At the briefing room Yossarian made his intelligence report to Captain Black and then waited in mutteringsuspense with all the others until Orr chugged into sight overhead finally with his one good engine still keepinghim aloft gamely. Nobody breathed. Orr’s landing gear would not come down. Yossarian hung around only untilOrr had crash-landed safely, and then stole the first jeep he could find with a key in the ignition and raced backto his tent to begin packing feverishly for the emergency rest leave he had decided to take in Rome, where hefound Luciana and her invisible scar that same night.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/651/3653.html","bookId":85,"book":{"id":85,"title":"第二十二条军规 Catch-22","description":"简介： 《第二十二条军规》是一部严肃的、讽刺性极强的小说。通过这部小说，约瑟夫海勒将他眼中的美国社会展现在读者眼前。这个社会处于一种有组织的混乱、一种制度化了的疯狂之中，...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/651","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
