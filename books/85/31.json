{"id":2250,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 31 Mrs. Daneeka","content":"When Colonel Cathcart learned that Doc Daneeka too had been killed in McWatt’s plane, he increased thenumber of missions to seventy.\n 　　The first person in the squadron to find out that Doc Daneeka was dead was Sergeant Towser, who had beeninformed earlier by the man in the control tower that Doc Daneeka’s name was down as a passenger on the pilot’s manifest McWatt had filed before taking off. Sergeant Towser brushed away a tear and struck DocDaneeka’s name from the roster of squadron personnel. With lips still quivering, he rose and trudged outsidereluctantly to break the bad news to Gus and Wes, discreetly avoiding any conversation with Doc Daneekahimself as he moved by the flight surgeon’s slight sepulchral figure roosting despondently on his stool in thelate-afternoon sunlight between the orderly room and the medical tent. Sergeant Towser’s heart was heavy; nowhe had two dead men on his hands—Mudd, the dead man in Yossarian’s tent who wasn’t even there, and DocDaneeka, the new dead man in the squadron, who most certainly was there and gave every indication of provinga still thornier administrative problem for him.\n 　　Gus and Wes listened to Sergeant Towser with looks of stoic surprise and said not a word about theirbereavement to anyone else until Doc Daneeka himself came in about an hour afterward to have his temperaturetaken for the third time that day and his blood pressure checked. The thermometer registered a half degree lowerthan his usual subnormal temperature of 96.8. Doc Daneeka was alarmed. The fixed, vacant, wooden stares of histwo enlisted men were even more irritating than always.\n 　　“Goddammit,” he expostulated politely in an uncommon excess of exasperation, “what’s the matter with you twomen anyway? It just isn’t right for a person to have a low temperature all the time and walk around with a stuffednose.” Doc Daneeka emitted a glum, self-pitying sniff and strolled disconsolately across the tent to help himselfto some aspirin and sulphur pills and paint his own throat with Argyrol. His downcast face was fragile andforlorn as a swallow’s, and he rubbed the back of his arms rhythmically. “Just look how cold I am right now.\n 　　You’re sure you’re not holding anything back?”\n 　　“You’re dead, sir,” one of his two enlisted men explained.\n 　　Doc Daneeka jerked his head up quickly with resentful distrust. “What’s that?”\n 　　“You’re dead, sir,” repeated the other. “That’s probably the reason you always feel so cold.”\n 　　“That’s right, sir. You’ve probably been dead all this time and we just didn’t detect it.”\n 　　“What the hell are you both talking about?” Doc Daneeka cried shrilly with a surging, petrifying sensation ofsome onrushing unavoidable disaster.\n 　　“It’s true, sir,” said one of the enlisted men. “The records show that you went up in McWatt’s plane to collectsome flight time. You didn’t come down in a parachute, so you must have been killed in the crash.”\n 　　“That’s right, sir,” said the other. “You ought to be glad you’ve got any temperature at all.”\n 　　Doc Daneeka’s mind was reeling in confusion. “Have you both gone crazy?” he demanded. “I’m going to reportthis whole insubordinate incident to Sergeant Towser.”\n 　　“Sergeant Towser’s the one who told us about it,” said either Gus or Wes. “The War Department’s even going tonotify your wife.”\n 　　Doc Daneeka yelped and ran out of the medical tent to remonstrate with Sergeant Towser, who edged away fromhim with repugnance and advised Doc Daneeka to remain out of sight as much as possible until some decisioncould be reached relating to the disposition of his remains.\n 　　“Gee, I guess he really is dead,” grieved one of his enlisted men in a low, respectful voice. “I’m going to misshim. He was a pretty wonderful guy, wasn’t he?”\n 　　“Yeah, he sure was,” mourned the other. “But I’m glad the little fuck is gone. I was getting sick and tired oftaking his blood pressure all the time.”\n 　　Mrs. Daneeka, Doc Daneeka’s wife, was not glad that Doc Daneeka was gone and split the peaceful StatenIsland night with woeful shrieks of lamentation when she learned by War Department telegram that her husbandhad been killed in action. Women came to comfort her, and their husbands paid condolence calls and hopedinwardly that she would soon move to another neighborhood and spare them the obligation of continuoussympathy. The poor woman was totally distraught for almost a full week. Slowly, heroically, she found thestrength to contemplate a future filled with dire problems for herself and her children. Just as she was growingresigned to her loss, the postman rang with a bolt from the blue—a letter from overseas that was signed with herhusband’s signature and urged her frantically to disregard any bad news concerning him. Mrs. Daneeka wasdumbfounded. The date on the letter was illegible. The handwriting throughout was shaky and hurried, but thestyle resembled her husband’s and the melancholy, self-pitying tone was familiar, although more dreary thanusual. Mrs. Daneeka was overjoyed and wept irrepressibly with relief and kissed the crinkled, grubby tissue ofV-mail stationery a thousand times. She dashed a grateful note off to her husband pressing him for details andsent a wire informing the War Department of its error. The War Department replied touchily that there had beenno error and that she was undoubtedly the victim of some sadistic and psychotic forger in her husband’ssquadron. The letter to her husband was returned unopened, stamped KILLED IN ACTION.\n 　　Mrs. Daneeka had been widowed cruelly again, but this time her grief was mitigated somewhat by a notificationfrom Washington that she was sole beneficiary of her husband’s $10,000 GI insurance policy, which amount wasobtainable by her on demand. The realization that she and the children were not faced immediately withstarvation brought a brave smile to her face and marked the turning point in her distress. The VeteransAdministration informed her by mail the very next day that she would be entitled to pension benefits for the restof her natural life because of her husband’s demise, and to a burial allowance for him of $250. A governmentcheck for $250 was enclosed. Gradually, inexorably, her prospects brightened. A letter arrived that same weekfrom the Social Security Administration stating that, under the provisions of the Old Age and SurvivorsInsurance Act Of 1935, she would receive monthly support for herself and her dependent children until theyreached the age of eighteen, and a burial allowance of $250. With these government letters as proof of death, sheapplied for payment on three life insurance policies Doc Daneeka had carried, with a value of $50,000 each; herclaim was honored and processed swiftly. Each day brought new unexpected treasures. A key to a safe-depositbox led to a fourth life insurance policy with a face value of $50,000, and to $18,000 in cash on which incometax had never been paid and need never be paid. A fraternal lodge to which he had belonged gave her a cemeteryplot. A second fraternal organization of which he had been a member sent her a burial allowance of $250. Hiscounty medical association gave her a burial allowance of $250.\n 　　The husbands of her closest friends began to flirt with her. Mrs. Daneeka was simply delighted with the waythings were turning out and had her hair dyed. Her fantastic wealth just kept piling up, and she had to remindherself daily that all the hundreds of thousands of dollars she was acquiring were not worth a single pennywithout her husband to share this good fortune with her. It astonished her that so many separate organizationswere willing to do so much to bury Doc Daneeka, who, back in Pianosa, was having a terrible time trying to keephis head above the ground and wondered with dismal apprehension why his wife did not answer the letter he hadwritten.\n 　　He found himself ostracized in the squadron by men who cursed his memory foully for having supplied ColonelCathcart with provocation to raise the number of combat missions. Records attesting to his death werepullulating like insect eggs and verifying each other beyond all contention. He drew no pay or PX rations anddepended for life on the charity of Sergeant Towser and Milo, who both knew he was dead. Colonel Cathcartrefused to see him, and Colonel Korn sent word through Major Danby that he would have Doc Daneekacremated on the spot if he ever showed up at Group Headquarters. Major Danby confided that Group wasincensed with all flight surgeons because of Dr. Stubbs, the bushy-haired, baggy-chinned, slovenly flight surgeonin Dunbar’s squadron who was deliberately and defiantly brewing insidious dissension there by grounding allmen with sixty missions on proper forms that were rejected by Group indignantly with orders restoring theconfused pilots, navigators, bombardiers and gunners to combat duty. Morale there was ebbing rapidly, andDunbar was under surveillance. Group was glad Doc Daneeka had been killed and did not intend to ask for areplacement.\n 　　Not even the chaplain could bring Doc Daneeka back to life under the circumstances. Alarm changed toresignation, and more and more Doc Daneeka acquired the look of an ailing rodent. The sacks under his eyesturned hollow and black, and he padded through the shadows fruitlessly like a ubiquitous spook. Even CaptainFlume recoiled when Doc Daneeka sought him out in the woods for help. Heartlessly, Gus and Wes turned himaway from their medical tent without even a thermometer for comfort, and then, only then, did he realize that, toall intents and purposes, he really was dead, and that he had better do something damned fast if he ever hoped tosave himself.\n 　　There was nowhere else to turn but to his wife, and he scribbled an impassioned letter begging her to bring hisplight to the attention of the War Department and urging her to communicate at once with his group commander,Colonel Cathcart, for assurances that—no matter what else she might have heard—it was indeed he, her husband,Doc Daneeka, who was pleading with her, and not a corpse or some impostor. Mrs. Daneeka was stunned by thedepth of emotion in the almost illegible appeal. She was torn with compunction and tempted to comply, but thevery next letter she opened that day was from that same Colonel Cathcart, her husband’s group commander, andbegan:\n 　　Dear Mrs., Mr., Miss, or Mr. and Mrs. Daneeka: Words cannot express the deep personal grief I experiencedwhen your husband, son, father or brother was killed, wounded or reported missing in action.\n 　　Mrs. Daneeka moved with her children to Lansing, Michigan, and left no forwarding address.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/651/3669.html","bookId":85,"book":{"id":85,"title":"第二十二条军规 Catch-22","description":"简介： 《第二十二条军规》是一部严肃的、讽刺性极强的小说。通过这部小说，约瑟夫海勒将他眼中的美国社会展现在读者眼前。这个社会处于一种有组织的混乱、一种制度化了的疯狂之中，...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/651","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
