{"id":107471,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Bond went to the reception desk to see if there was a message from Quarrel. “No messages, sir,” said the girl. “But a basket of fruit came from King\u0027s House. Just after lunch. The messenger took it up to your room.”\\n\\n “What sort of a messenger?”\\n\\n “Coloured man, sir. Said he was from the ADC\u0027s office.”\\n\\n “Thank you.” Bond took his key and went up the stairs to the first floor. It was ridiculously improbable. His hand on the gun under his coat, Bond softly approached his door. He turned the key and kicked the door open. The empty room yawned at him. Bond shut and locked the door. On his dressing table was a large, ornate basket of fruit-tangerines, grapefruit, pink bananas, soursop, star-apples and even a couple of hothouse nectarines. Attached to a broad ribbon on the handle was a white envelope. Bond removed it and held it up to the light. He opened it. On a plain sheet of expensive white writing paper was typed \u0027With the Compliments of His Excellency the Governor\u0027.\\n\\n Bond snorted. He stood looking at the fruit. He bent his ear to it and listened. He then took the basket by the handle and tipped its contents out on to the floor. The fruit bounced and rolled over the coconut matting. There was nothing but fruit in the basket. Bond grinned at his precautions. There was a last possibility. He picked up one of the nectarines, the most likely for a greedy man to choose first, and took it into the bathroom. He dropped it in the washbasin and went back to the bedroom and, after inspecting the lock, unlocked the wardrobe. Gingerly he lifted out his suitcase and stood it in the middle of the room. He knelt down and looked for the traces of talcum powder he had dusted round the two locks. They were smeared and there were minute scratches round the keyholes. Bond sourly examined the marks. These people were not as careful as some others he had had to deal with. He unlocked the case and stood it up on end. There were four innocent copper studs in the welting at the front right-hand corner of the lid. Bond prised at the top one of these studs with his nail and it eased out. He took hold of it and pulled out three feet of thick steel wire and put it on the floor beside him. This wire threaded through small wire loops inside the lid and sewed the case shut. Bond lifted the lid and verified that nothing had been disturbed. From his \u0027tool case\u0027 he took out a jeweller\u0027s glass and went back into the bathroom and switched on the light over the shaving mirror. He screwed the glass into his eye and gingerly picked the nectarine out of the washbasin and revolved it slowly between finger and thumb.\\n\\n Bond stopped turning the nectarine. He had come to a minute pinhole, its edges faintly discoloured brown. It was in the crevice of the fruit, invisible except under a magnifying glass. Bond put the nectarine carefully down in the washbasin. He stood for a moment and looked thoughtfully into his eyes in the mirror.\\n\\n So it was war! Well, well. How very interesting. Bond felt the slight tautening of the skin at the base of his stomach. He smiled thinly at his reflection in the mirror. So his instincts and his reasoning had been correct. Strangways and the girl had been murdered and their records destroyed because they had got too hot on the trail. Then Bond had come on the scene and, thanks to Miss Taro, they had been waiting for him. Miss Chung, and perhaps the taxi driver, had picked up the scent. He had been traced to the Blue Hills hotel. The first shot had been fired. There would be others. And whose finger was on the trigger? Who had got him so accurately in his sights? Bond\u0027s mind was made up. The evidence was nil. But he was certain of it. This was long range fire, from Crab Key. The man behind the gun was Doctor No.\\n\\n Bond walked back into the bedroom. One by one he picked up the fruit and took each piece back to the bathroom and examined it through his glass. The pin-prick was always there, concealed in the stalk-hole or a crevice. Bond rang down and asked for a cardboard box and paper and string. He packed the fruit carefully in the box and picked up the telephone and called King\u0027s House. He asked for the Colonial Secretary. “That you, Pleydell-Smith? James Bond speaking. Sorry to bother you. Got a bit of a problem. Is there a public analyst in Kingston? I see. Well, I\u0027ve got something I want analysed. If I sent the box down to you, would you be very kind and pass it on to this chap? I don\u0027t want my name to come into this. All right? I\u0027ll explain later. When you get his report would you send me a short telegram telling me the answer? I\u0027ll be at Beau Desert, over at Morgan\u0027s Harbour, for the next week or so. Be glad if you\u0027d keep that to yourself too. Sorry to be so damned mysterious. I\u0027ll explain everything when I see you next. I expect you\u0027ll get a clue when you see what the analyst has to say. And by the way, tell him to handle the specimens carefully, would you. Warn him there\u0027s more in them than meets the eye. Very many thanks. Lucky I met you this morning. Goodbye.”\\n\\n Bond addressed the parcel and went down and paid a taxi to deliver it at once to King\u0027s House. It was six o\u0027clock. He went back to his room and had a shower and changed and ordered his first drink. He was about to take it out on the balcony when the telephone rang. It was Quarrel.\\n\\n “Everyting fixed, cap\u0027n.”\\n\\n “Everything? That\u0027s wonderful. That house all right?”\\n\\n “Everyting okay.” Quarrel repeated, his voice careful. “See yo as yo done said, cap\u0027n.”\\n\\n “Fine,” said Bond. He was impressed with Quarrel\u0027s efficiency and a sense of security. He put down the telephone and went out on to the balcony.\\n\\n The sun was just setting. The wave of violet shadow was creeping down towards the town and the harbour. When it hits the town, thought Bond, the lights will go on. It happened as he had expected. Above him there was the noise of a plane. It came into sight, a Super Constellation, the same flight that Bond had been on the night before. Bond watched it sweep out over the sea and then turn and come in to land at the Palisadoes airport. What a long way he had come since that moment, only twenty-four hours before, when the door of the plane had clanged open and the loudspeaker had said, \u0027This ia Kingston, Jamaica. Will passengers please remain seated until the aircraft has been cleared by the Health Authorities.\"\\n\\n Should he tell M how the picture had changed? Should he make a report to the Governor? Bond thought of the Governor and dismissed that idea. But what about M? Bond had his own cipher. He could easily send M a signal through the Colonial Office. What would he say to M? That Doctor No had sent him some poisoned fruit? But he didn\u0027t even know that it was poisoned, or, for the matter of that, that it had come from Doctor No. Bond could see M\u0027s face as he read the signal. He saw him press down the lever on the intercom: “Chief of Staff, 007\u0027s gone round the bend. Says someone\u0027s been trying to feed him a poisoned banana. Fellow\u0027s lost his nerve. Been in hospital too long. Better call him home.”\\n\\n Bond smiled to himself. He got up and rang down for another drink. It wouldn\u0027t be quite like that, of course. But still... No, he\u0027d wait until he had something more to show. Of course if something went badly wrong, and he hadn\u0027t sent a warning, he\u0027d be in trouble. It was up to him to see that nothing did go wrong.\\n\\n Bond drank his second drink and thought over the details of his plan. Then he went down and had dinner in the half-deserted dining-room and read the Handbook of the West Indies. By nine o\u0027clock he was half asleep. He went back to his room and packed his bag ready for the morning. He telephoned down and arranged to be called at five-thirty. Then he bolted the door on the inside, and also shut and bolted the slatted jalousies across the windows. It would mean a hot, stuffy night. That couldn\u0027t be helped. Bond climbed naked under the single cotton sheet and turned over on his left side and slipped his right hand on to the butt of the Walther PPK under the pillow. In five minutes he was asleep.\\n\\n The next thing Bond knew was that it was three o\u0027clock in the morning. He knew it was three o\u0027clock because the luminous dial of his watch was close to his face. He lay absolutely still. There was not a sound in the room. He strained his ears. Outside, too, it was deathly quiet. Far in the distance a dog started to bark. Other dogs joined in and there was a brief hysterical chorus which stopped as suddenly as it had begun. Then it was quite quiet again. The moon coming through the slats in the jalousies threw black and white bars across the corner of the room next to his bed. It was as if he was lying in a cage. What had woken him up? Bond moved softly, preparing to slip out of bed.\\n\\n Bond stopped moving. He stopped as dead as a live man can.\\n\\n Something had stirred on his right ankle. Now it was moving up the inside of his shin. Bond could feel the hairs on his leg being parted. It was an insect of some sort. A very big one. It was long, five or six inches-as long as his hand. He could feel dozens of tiny feet lightly touching his skin. What was it?\\n\\n Then Bond heard something he had never heard before-the sound of the hair on his head rasping up on the pillow. Bond analysed the noise. It couldn\u0027t be! It simply couldn\u0027t! Yes, his hair was standing on end. Bond could even feel the cool air reaching his scalp between the hairs. How extraordinary! How very extraordinary! He had always thought it was a figure of speech. But why? Why was it happening to him?\\n\\n The thing on his leg moved. Suddenly Bond realized that he was afraid, terrified. His instincts, even before they had communicated with his brain, had told his body that he had a centipede on him.\\n\\n Bond lay frozen. He had once seen a tropical centipede in a bottle of spirit on the shelf in a museum. It had been pale brown and very flat and five or six inches long-about the length of this one. On either side of the blunt head there had been curved poison claws. The label on the bottle had said that its poison was mortal if it hit an artery. Bond had looked curiously at the corkscrew of dead cuticle and had moved on.\\n\\n The centipede had reached his knee. It was starting up his thigh. Whatever happened he mustn\u0027t move, mustn\u0027t even tremble. Bond\u0027s whole consciousness had drained down to the two rows of softly creeping feet. Now they had reached his flank. God, it was turning down towards his groin! Bond set his teeth! Supposing it liked the warmth there! Supposing it tried to crawl into the crevices! Could he stand it? Supposing it chose that place to bite? Bond could feel it questing amongst the first hairs. It tickled. The skin on Bond\u0027s belly fluttered. There was nothing he could do to control it. But now the thing was turning up and along his stomach. Its feet were gripping tighter to prevent it falling. Now it was at his heart. If it bit there, surely it would kill him. The centipede trampled steadily on through the thin hairs on Bond\u0027s right breast up to his collar bone. It stopped. What was it doing? Bond could feel the blunt head questing blindly to and fro. What was it looking for? Was there room between his skin and the sheet for it to get through? Dare he lift the sheet an inch to help it. No. Never! The animal was at the base of his jugular. Perhaps it was intrigued by the heavy pulse there. Christ, if only he could control the pumping of his blood. Damn you! Bond tried to communicate with the centipede. It\u0027s nothing. It\u0027s not dangerous, that pulse. It means you no harm. Get on out into the fresh air!\\n\\n As if the beast had heard, it moved on up the column of the neck and into the stubble on Bond\u0027s chin. Now it was at the corner of his mouth, tickling madly. On it went, up along the nose. Now he could feel its whole weight and length. Softly Bond closed his eyes. Two by two the pairs of feet, moving alternately, trampled across his right eyelid. When it got off his eye, should he take a chance and shake it off-rely on its feet slipping in his sweat? No, for God\u0027s sake! The grip of the feet was endless. He might shake one lot off, but not the rest. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/doctor-no-james-bond-6/page-10.html","bookId":1549,"book":{"id":1549,"title":"Doctor No (James Bond #6)","description":"Storyline: Doctor No (James Bond (Original Series) #6) \\n James Bond travels to the Caribbean to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a secret service team.
