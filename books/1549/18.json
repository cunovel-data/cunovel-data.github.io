{"id":107479,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"“But there\u0027s nothing left of it. It\u0027s, a ruin in the middle of the cane fields.” “I live in the cellars. I\u0027ve lived there since I was five. It was burned down then and my parents were killed. I can\u0027t remember anything about them so you needn\u0027t say you\u0027re sorry. At first I lived there with my black nanny. She died when I was fifteen. For the last five years I\u0027ve lived there alone.” “Good heavens.” Bond was appalled. “But wasn\u0027t there anyone, else to look after you? Didn\u0027t your parents leave any money?” “Not a penny.” There was no bitterness in the girl\u0027s voice-pride if anything. “You see the Riders were one of the old Jamaican families. The first one had been given the Beau Desert lands by Cromwell for having been one of the people who signed King Charles\u0027s death warrant. He built the Great House and my family lived in it on and off ever since. But then sugar collapsed and I suppose the place was badly run, and by the time my father inherited it there was nothing but debts •-mortgages and things like that. So when my father and mother died the property was sold up. I didn\u0027t mind. I was too young. Nanny must have been wonderful. They wanted people to adopt me, the clergyman and the legal people did, but Nanny collected the sticks of furniture that hadn\u0027t been burned and we settled down in the ruins and after a bit no one came and interfered with us. She did a bit of sewing and laundry in the village and grew a few plantains and bananas and things and there was a big breadfruit tree up against the old house. We ate what the Jamaicans eat. And there was the sugar cane all round us and she made a fishpot which we used to go and take up every day. It was all right. We had enough to eat. Somehow she taught me to read and write. There was a pile of old books left from the fire. There was an encyclopedia. I started with A when I was about eight. I\u0027ve got as far as the middle of T.” She said defensively. “I bet I know more than you do about a lot of things.” “I bet you do.” Bond was lost in the picture of the little flaxen-haired girl pattering about the ruins with the obstinate old Negress watching over her and calling her in to do the lessons that must have been just as much a riddle to the old woman. “Your nanny must have been a wonderful person.” “She was a darling.” It was a flat statement. “I thought I\u0027d die when she did. It wasn\u0027t such fun after that: Before, I\u0027d led a child\u0027s life; then I suddenly had to grow up and do everything for myself. And men tried to catch me and hurt me. They said they wanted to make love to me.” She paused. “I used to be pretty then.” Bond said seriously, “You\u0027re one of the most beautiful girls I\u0027ve ever seen.” “With this nose? Don\u0027t be silly.” “You don\u0027t understand.” Bond tried to find words that she would believe. “Of course anyone can see your nose is broken. But since this morning I\u0027ve hardly noticed it. When you look at a person you look into their eyes or at their mouth. That\u0027s where the expressions are. A broken nose isn\u0027t any more significant than a crooked ear. Noses and ears are bits of face-furniture. Some are prettier than others, but they\u0027re not nearly as important as the rest. They\u0027re part of the background of the face. If you had a beautiful nose as well as the rest of you you\u0027d be the most beautiful girl in Jamaica.” “Do you mean that?” her voice was urgent. “Do you think I could be beautiful? I know some of me\u0027s all right, but when I look in the glass I hardly see anything except my broken nose. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s like that with other people who are, who are-well-sort of deformed.” Bond said impatiently, “You\u0027re not deformed! Don\u0027t talk such nonsense. And anyway you can have it put right by a simple operation. You\u0027ve only got to get over to America and it would be done in a week.” She said angrily, “How do you expect me to do that? I\u0027ve got about fifteen pounds under a stone in my cellar. I\u0027ve got three skirts and three shirts and a knife and a fishpot. I know all about these operations. The doctor at Port Maria found out for me. He\u0027s a nice man. He wrote to America. Do you know, to have it properly done it would cost me about five hundred pounds, what with the fare to New York and the hospital and everything?” Her voice became hopeless. “How do you expect me to find that amount of money?” Bond had already made up his mind what would have to be done about that. Now he merely said tenderly, “Well, I expect there are ways. But anyway, go on with your story. It\u0027s very exciting-far more interesting than mine. You\u0027d got to where your Nanny died. What happened then?” The girl began again reluctantly. \"Well, it\u0027s your fault for interrupting. And you mustn\u0027t talk about things you don\u0027t understand. I suppose people tell you you\u0027re good-looking. I expect you get all the girls you want. Well you wouldn\u0027t if you had a squint or a hare-lip or something. As a matter of fact,“ he could hear the smile in her voice, ”I think I shall go to the obeahman when we get back and get him to put a spell on you and give you something like that.“ She added lamely, ”Then we should be more alike.\" Bond reached out. His hand brushed against her. “I\u0027ve got other plans,” he said. “But come on. I want to hear the rest of the story.” “Oh well,” the girl sighed, “I\u0027ll have to go back a bit. You see all the property is in cane and the old house stands in the middle of it. Well, about twice a year they cut the cane and send it off to the mill. And when they do that all the animals and insects and so on that live in the cane fields go into a panic and most of them have their houses destroyed and get killed. At cutting time some of them took to coming to the ruins of the house and hiding. My Nanny was terrified of them to begin with, the mongooses and the snakes and the scorpions and so on, but I made a couple of the cellar rooms into sort of homes for them. I wasn\u0027t frightened of them and they never hurt me. They seemed to understand that I was looking after them. They must have told their friends or something because after a bit it was quite natural for them all to come trooping into their rooms and settling down there until the young cane had started to grow again. Then they all filed out and went back to living in the fields. I gave them what food we could spare when they were staying with us and they behaved very well except for making a bit of a smell and sometimes fighting amongst each other. But they all got quite tame with me, and their children did, too, and I could do anything with them... Of course the cane-cutters found out about this and saw me walking about with snakes round my neck and so forth, and they got frightened of me and thought I was obeah. So they left us absolutely alone.” She paused. “That\u0027s where I found out so much about animals and insects. I used to spend a lot of time in the sea finding out about those people too. It was the same with birds. If you find out what all these people like to eat and what they\u0027re afraid of, and if you spend all your time with them you can make friends.” She looked up at him. “You miss a lot not knowing about these things.” “I\u0027m afraid I do,” said Bond truthfully. “I expect they\u0027re much nicer and more interesting than humans.” “I don\u0027t know about that,” said the girl thoughtfully. “I don\u0027t know many human people. Most of the ones I have met have been hateful. But I suppose they can be interesting too.” She paused. “I hadn\u0027t every really thought of liking them like I like the animals. Except for Nanny, of course. Until...” She broke off with a shy laugh. “Well, anyway we all lived happily together until I was fifteen and Nanny died and then things got difficult. There was a man called Mander. A horrible man. He was the white overseer for the people who own the property. He kept coming to see me. He wanted me to move up to his house near Port Maria. I hated him and I used to hide when I heard his horse coming through the cane. One night he came on foot and I didn\u0027t hear him. He was drunk. He came into the cellar and fought with me because I wouldn\u0027t do what he wanted me to do. You know, the things people in love do.” “Yes, I know.” “I tried to kill him with my knife, but he was very strong and he hit me as hard as he could in the face and broke my nose. He knocked me unconscious and then I think he did things to me. I mean I know he did. Next day I wanted to kill myself when I saw my face and when I found what he had done. I thought I would have a baby. I would certainly have killed myself if I\u0027d had a baby by that man. Anyway, I didn\u0027t, so that was that. I went to the doctor and he did what he could for my nose and didn\u0027t charge me anything. I didn\u0027t tell him about the rest. I was too ashamed. The man didn\u0027t come back. I waited and did nothing until the next cane-cutting. I\u0027d got my plan. I was waiting for the Black Widow spiders to come in for shelter. One day they came. I caught the biggest of the females and shut her in a box with nothing to eat. They\u0027re the bad ones, the females. Then I waited for a dark night without any moon. I took the box with the spider in it and walked and walked until I came to the man\u0027s house. It was very dark and I was frightened of the duppies I might meet on the road but I didn\u0027t see any. I waited in his garden in the bushes and watched him go up to bed. Then I climbed a tree and got on to his balcony. I waited there until I heard him snoring and then I crept through the window. He was lying naked on the bed under the mosquito net. I lifted the edge and opened the box and shook the spider out on to his stomach. Then I went away and came home.” “God-Almighty!” said Bond reverently. “What happened to him?” She said happily, “He took a week to die. It must have hurt ” terribly. They do, you know. The obeahmen say there\u0027s nothing like it.“ She paused. When Bond made no comment, she said anxiously, ”You don\u0027t think I did wrong, do you?\" “It\u0027s not a thing to make a habit of,” said Bond mildly. “But I can\u0027t say I blame you the way it was. So what happened then?” “Well then I just settled down again,” her voice was matter-of-fact. “I had to concentrate on getting enough food, and of ” course all I wanted to do was save up money to get my nose made good again.“ She said persuasively, ”It really was quite a pretty nose before. Do you think the doctors can put it back to how it was?\" “They can make it any shape you like,” said Bond definitely. “What did you make money at?” “It was the encyclopedia. It told me that people collect sea-shells. That one could sell the rare ones. I talked to the local schoolmaster, without telling him my secret of course, and he found out that there\u0027s an American magazine called Nautilus for shell collectors. I had just enough money to subscribe to it and I began looking for the shells that people said they wanted in the advertisements. I wrote to a dealer in Miami and he started buying from me. It was thrilling. Of course I made some awful mistakes to begin with. I thought people would like the prettiest shells, but they don\u0027t. Very often they want the ugliest. And then when I found rare ones I cleaned them and polished them to make them look better. That\u0027s wrong too. They want shells just as they come out of the sea, with the animal in and all. So I got some formalin from the doctor and put it into the live shells to stop them smelling and sent them off to this man in Miami, I only got it right about a year ago and I\u0027ve already made fifteen pounds. I\u0027d worked out that now I knew how they wanted them, and if I was lucky, I ought to make at least fifty pounds a year. Then in ten years I would be able to go to America and have the operation. And then,” she giggled delightedly, “I had a terrific stroke of luck. I went over to Crab Key. I\u0027d been there before, but this was just before Christmas, and I found these purple shells. They didn\u0027t look very exciting, but I sent one or two to Miami and the man wrote back at once and said he could take as many as I could get at five dollars each for the whole ones. He said that I must keep the place where they live a dead secret as otherwise we\u0027d what he called \u0027spoil the market\u0027 and the price would get cheaper. It\u0027s just like having one\u0027s private gold mine. Now I may be able to save up the money in five years. That\u0027s why I was so suspicious of you when I found you on my beach. I thought you\u0027d come to steal my shells.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/doctor-no-james-bond-6/page-18.html","bookId":1549,"book":{"id":1549,"title":"Doctor No (James Bond #6)","description":"Storyline: Doctor No (James Bond (Original Series) #6) James Bond travels to the Caribbean to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a secret service team.
