{"id":107482,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Patients, thought Bond. That\u0027s the second time she\u0027s used the word. He smiled politely at the girl. “How do you do. Yes, we\u0027d certainly both of us like to get to our rooms.”\\n\\n May embraced them both with a warm smile. She said in a low, attractive voice, “I do hope you\u0027ll both be comfortable, Mr Bryce. I took the liberty of ordering breakfast as soon as I heard you had come in. Shall we...?” Corridors branched off to left and right of double lift-doors set in the wall opposite. The girl led the way to the right. Bond and Honeychile followed with Sister Lily taking up the rear.\\n\\n Numbered doors led off the corridor on either side. Now the decor was in the lightest pink with a dove grey carpet. The numbers on the doors were in the tens. The corridor came to an abrupt end with two doors side by side, 14 and 15. May opened the door of 14, and they followed her in.\\n\\n It was a charming double bedroom in modern Miami style with dark green walls, dark polished mahogany floor with occasional thick white rugs, and well-designed bamboo furniture with a chintz of large red roses on a white background. There was a communicating door into a more masculine dressing-room and another that led into an extremely luxurious modern bathroom with a step-down bath and a bidet.\\n\\n It was like being shown into the very latest Florida hotel suite-except for two details which Bond noticed. There were no windows and no inside handles to the doors.\\n\\n May looked hopefully from one to the other.\\n\\n Bond turned to Honeychile. He smiled at her. “It looks very comfortable, don\u0027t you think, darling?”\\n\\n The girl played with the edge of her skirt. She nodded, not looking at him.\\n\\n There was a timid knock on the door and another girl, as pretty as May, tripped in with a loaded tray balanced on her upturned hand. She put it down on the centre table and pulled up two chairs. She whisked off the speckless linen cloth that covered the dishes and pattered out of the room. There was a delicious smell of bacon and coffee.\\n\\n May and Sister Lily backed to the door. The older woman stopped on the threshold. “And now we\u0027ll leave you two dear people in peace. If you want anything, just ring. The bells are by the bed. Oh, and by the way, you\u0027ll find plenty of fresh clothes in the cupboards. Chinese style, I\u0027m afraid,” she twinkled apologetically, “but I hope they\u0027re the right sizes. The wardrobe room only got the measurements yesterday evening. The Doctor has given strict orders that you\u0027re not to be disturbed. He\u0027d be delighted if you\u0027d join him for dinner this evening. He wants you to have the whole of the rest of the day to yourselves-to get settled down, you know.” She paused and looked from \u0027one to the other smiling inquiry. “Shall I say you...?”\\n\\n “Yes, please,” said Bond. “Tell the Doctor we shall be delighted to join him for dinner.”\\n\\n “Oh, I know he\u0027ll be so pleased.” With a last twitter the two women softly withdrew and closed the door behind them.\\n\\n Bond turned towards Honeychile. She looked embarrassed. She still avoided his eyes. It occurred to Bond that she could never have met such soft treatment or seen such luxury in her life. To her, all this must be far more strange and terrifying than what they had gone through outside. She stood and fiddled at the hem of her Man Friday skirt. There were streaks of dried sweat and salt and dust on her face. Her bare legs were filthy and Bond noticed that her toes were moving softly as they gripped nervously into the wonderful thick pile carpet.\\n\\n Bond laughed. He laughed with real pleasure that her fear had been drowned in the basic predicament of clothes and how to behave, and he laughed at the picture they made-she in her rags and he in his dirty blue shirt and black jeans and muddy canvas shoes.\\n\\n He went to her and took her hands. They were cold. He said, “Honey, we\u0027re a couple of scarecrows. There\u0027s only one problem. Shall we have breakfast first while it\u0027s hot, or shall we get out of these rags and have a bath and eat the breakfast when it\u0027s cold? Don\u0027t worry about anything else. We\u0027re here in this wonderful little house and that\u0027s all that matters. Now then, what shall we do?”\\n\\n She smiled uncertainly. The blue eyes searched his face for reassurance. “You\u0027re not worried about what\u0027s going to happen to us?” She nodded at the room. “Don\u0027t you think this is all a trap?”\\n\\n “If it\u0027s a trap we\u0027re in it. There\u0027s nothing we can do now but eat the cheese. The only question is whether we eat it hot or cold.” He pressed her hands. “Really, Honey. Leave the worrying to me. Just think where we were an hour ago. Isn\u0027t this better? Now come on and decide the really important things. Bath or breakfast?”\\n\\n She said reluctantly, “Well, if you think... I mean-I\u0027d rather get clean first.” She added quickly, “But you\u0027ve got to help me.” She jerked her head towards the bathroom door.\\n\\n “I don\u0027t know how to work one of those places. What do you do?”\\n\\n Bond said seriously, “It\u0027s quite easy. I\u0027ll fix it all ready for you. While you\u0027re having your bath, I\u0027ll have my breakfast. I\u0027ll keep yours warm.” Bond went to one of the built-in clothes cupboards and ran the door back. There were half a dozen kimonos, some silk and some linen. He took out a linen one at random. “You take off your clothes and\u0027 get into this and I\u0027ll get the bath ready. Later on you can choose the things you want to wear for bed and dinner.”\\n\\n She said gratefully, “Oh yes, James. If you\u0027ll just show me...” She started to unbutton her shirt.\\n\\n Bond wanted to take her in his arms and kiss her. Instead he said abruptly, “That\u0027s fine, Honey,” and went into the bathroom and turned on the taps.\\n\\n There was everything in the bathroom-Floris Lime bath essence for men and Guerlain bathcubes for women. He crushed a cube into the water and at once the room smelled like an orchid house. The soap was Guerlain\u0027s Sapoceti, Fleurs des Alpes. In a medicine cupboard behind the mirror over the washbasin were toothbrushes and toothpaste, Steradent toothpicks, Rose mouthwash, dental floss, Aspirin and Milk of Magnesia. There was also an electric razor, Lentheric aftershave lotion, and two nylon hairbrushes and combs. Everything was brand new and untouched.\\n\\n Bond looked at his filthy unshaven face in the mirror and smiled grimly into the grey, sunburned castaway\u0027s eyes. The coating on the pill was certainly of the very finest sugar. It would be wise to expect that the medicine inside would be of the bitterest.\\n\\n He turned back to the bath and felt the water. It would be too hot for someone who presumably had never had a hot bath before. He let in some cold. As he bent over, two arms were thrown round his neck. He stood up. The golden body blazed in the white tiled bathroom. She kissed him hard and clumsily on the lips. He put his arms round her and crushed her to him, his heart pounding. She said breathlessly at his ear. “The Chinese dress felt strange. Anyway, you told that woman we were married.”\\n\\n Bond\u0027s hand was on her left breast. Its peak was hard with passion. Her stomach pressed against his. Why not? Why not? Don\u0027t be a fool! This is a crazy time for it. You\u0027re both in deadly danger. You must stay cold as ice to have any chance of getting out of this mess. Later! Later! Don\u0027t be weak.\\n\\n Bond took his hand away from her breast and put it round her neck. He rubbed his face against hers and then brought his mouth round to hers and gave her one long kiss.\\n\\n He stood away and held her at arm\u0027s length. For a moment they looked at each other, their eyes bright with desire. She was breathing fast, her lips parted so that he could see the glint of teeth. He said unsteadily, “Honey, get into that bath before I spank you.”\\n\\n She smiled. Without saying anything she stepped down into the bath and lay at full length. She looked up. The fair hair on her body glittered up through the water like golden sovereigns. She said provocatively, “You\u0027ve got to wash me. I don\u0027t know what to do. You\u0027ve got to show me.”\\n\\n Bond said desperately, “Shut up, Honey. And stop flirting. Just take the soap and the sponge and start scrubbing. Damn you! This isn\u0027t the time for making love. I\u0027m going to have breakfast.” He reached for the door handle and opened the door. She said softly, “James!” He looked back. She was sticking her tongue out at him. He grinned savagely back at her and slammed the door.\\n\\n Bond went into the dressing-room and stood in the middle of the floor and waited for his heart to stop pounding. He rubbed his hands over his face and shook his head to get rid of the thought of her.\\n\\n To clear his mind he went carefully over both rooms looking for exits, possible weapons, microphones-anything that would add to his knowledge. There were none of these things. There was an electric clock on the wall which said eight-thirty and a row of bells beside the double bed. They said, Room Service, Coiffeur, Manicurist, Maid. There was no telephone; High up in a corner of both rooms was a small ventilator grille. \u003e Each was about two feet square. Useless. The doors appeared to be of some light metal, painted to match the walls. Bond ; threw the whole weight of his body against one of them. It didn\u0027t give a millimetre. Bond rubbed his shoulder. The place was a prison-an exquisite prison. It was no good arguing. The trap had shut tight on them. Now the only thing for the mice to do was to make the most of the cheese.\\n\\n Bond sat down at the breakfast table. There was a large tumbler of pineapple juice in a silver-plated bowl of crushed ice. He swallowed it down and lifted the cover oil his individual hot-plate. Scrambled eggs on toast, four rashers of bacon, a grilled kidney and what looked like an English pork sausage. There were also two kinds of hot toast, rolls inside a napkin, marmalade, honey and strawberry jam. The coffee was boiling hot in a large Thermos decanter. The cream smelled fresh.\\n\\n From the bathroom came the sound of the girl crooning \u0027Marion\u0027. Bond closed his ears to the sound and started on the eggs.\\n\\n Ten minutes later, Bond heard the bathroom door open. He put down his toast and marmalade and covered his eyes with his hands. She laughed. She said, “He\u0027s a coward. He\u0027s frightened of a simple girl.” Bond heard her rummaging in the cupboards. She went on talking, half to herself. “I wonder why he\u0027s frightened. Of course if I wrestled with him I\u0027d win easily. Perhaps he\u0027s frightened of that. Perhaps he\u0027s really not very strong. His arms and his chest look strong enough. I haven\u0027t seen the rest yet. Perhaps it\u0027s weak. Yes, that must be it. That\u0027s why he doesn\u0027t dare take his clothes off in front of me. H\u0027m, now let\u0027s see, would he like me in this?” She raised her voice. “Darling James, would you like me in white with pale blue birds flying all over me?”\\n\\n “Yes, damn you,” said Bond through his hands. “Now stop chattering to yourself and come and have breakfast. I\u0027m getting sleepy.”\\n\\n She gave a cry. “Oh, if you mean it\u0027s time for us to go to bed, of course I\u0027ll hurry.”\\n\\n There was a flurry of feet and Bond heard her sit down opposite. He took his hands down. She was smiling at him. She looked ravishing. Her hair was dressed and combed and brushed to kill, with one side falling down the side of the cheek and the other slicked back behind her ear. Her skin sparkled with freshness and the big blue eyes were alight with happiness. Now Bond loved the broken nose. It had become part of his thoughts of her and it suddenly occurred to him that he would be sad when she was just an immaculately beautiful girl like other beautiful girls. But he knew it would be no good trying to persuade her of that. She sat demurely, with her hands in her lap below the end of a cleavage which showed half her breasts and a deep vee of her stomach. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/doctor-no-james-bond-6/page-22.html","bookId":1549,"book":{"id":1549,"title":"Doctor No (James Bond #6)","description":"Storyline: Doctor No (James Bond (Original Series) #6) \\n James Bond travels to the Caribbean to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a secret service team.
