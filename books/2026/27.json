{"id":108096,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"It was only a little while later that Edward reminded me of my priorities. It took him just one word. \"Renesmee...\" I sighed. She would be awake soon. It must be nearly seven in the morning. Would she be looking for me? Abruptly, something close to panic had my body freezing up. What would she look like today? Edward felt the total distraction of my stress. \"It\u0027s all right, love. Get dressed, and we\u0027ll be back to the house in two seconds.\" I probably looked like a cartoon, the way I sprung up, then looked back at him - his diamond body faintly glinting in the diffuse light - then away to the west, where Renesmee waited, then back at him again, then back toward her, my head whipping from side to side a half dozen times in a second. Edward smiled, but didn\u0027t laugh; he was a strong man. \"It\u0027s all about balance, love. You\u0027re so good at all of this, I don\u0027t imagine it will take too long to put everything in perspective.\" \"And we have all night, right?\" He smiled wider. \"Do you think I could bear to let you get dressed now if that weren\u0027t the case?\" That would have to be enough to get me through the daylight hours. I would balance this overwhelming, devastating desire so that I could be a good - It was hard to think the word. Though Renesmee was very real and vital in my life, it was still difficult to think of myself as a mother. I supposed anyone would feel the same, though, without nine months to get used to the idea. And with a child that changed by the hour. The thought of Renesmee\u0027s speeding life had me stressed-out again in an instant. I didn\u0027t even pause at the ornately carved double doors to catch my breath before finding out what Alice had done. I just burst through, intent on wearing the first things I touched. I should have known it wouldn\u0027t be that easy. \"Which ones are mine?\" I hissed. As promised, the room was bigger than our bedroom. It might have been bigger than the rest of the house put together, but I\u0027d have to pace it off to be positive. I had a brief mental flash of Alice trying to persuade Esme to ignore classic proportions and allow this monstrosity. I wondered how Alice had won that one. Everything was wrapped in garment bags, pristine and white, row after row after row. \"To the best of my knowledge, everything but this rack here\" - he touched a bar that stretched along the half-wall to the left of the door - \"is yours.\" \"All of this?\" He shrugged. \"Alice,\" we said together. He said her name like an explanation; I said it like an expletive. \"Fine,\" I muttered, and I pulled down the zipper on the closest bag. I growled under my breath when I saw the floorlength silk gown inside - baby pink. Finding something normal to wear could take all day! \"Let me help,\" Edward offered. He sniffed carefully at the air and then followed some scent to the back of the long room. There was a built-in dresser there. He sniffed again, then opened a drawer. With a triumphant grin, he held out a pair of artfully faded blue jeans. I flitted to his side. \"How did you do that?\" \"Denim has its own scent just like anything else. Now... stretch cotton?\" He followed his nose to a half-rack, unearthing a long-sleeved white t-shirt. He tossed it to me. \"Thanks,\" I said fervently. I inhaled each fabric, memorizing the scent for future searches through this madhouse. I remembered silk and satin; I would avoid those. It only took him seconds to find his own clothes - if I hadn\u0027t seen him undressed, I would have sworn there was nothing more beautiful than Edward in his khakis and pale beige pullover - and then he took my hand. We darted through the hidden garden, leaped lightly over the stone wall, and hit the forest at a dead sprint. I pulled my hand free so that we could race back. He beat me this time. Renesmee was awake; she was sitting up on the floor with Rose and Emmett hovering over her, playing with a little pile of twisted silverware. She had a mangled spoon in her right hand. As soon as she spied me through the glass, she chucked the spoon on the floor - where it left a divot in the wood - and pointed in my direction imperiously. Her audience laughed; Alice, Jasper, Esme, and Carlisle were sitting on the couch, watching her as if she were the most engrossing film. I was through the door before their laughter had barely begun, bounding across the room and scooping her up from the floor in the same second. We smiled widely at each other. She was different, but not so much. A little longer again, her proportions drifting from babyish to childlike. Her hair was longer by a quarter inch, the curls bouncing like springs with every movement. I\u0027d let my imagination run wild on the trip back, and I\u0027d imagined worse than this. Thanks to my overdone fears, these little changes were almost a relief. Even without Carlisle\u0027s measurements, I was sure the changes were slower than yesterday. Renesmee patted my cheek. I winced. She was hungry again. \"How long has she been up?\" I asked as Edward disappeared through the kitchen doorway. I was sure he was on his way to get her breakfast, having seen what she\u0027d just thought as clearly as I had. I wondered if he would ever have noticed her little quirk, if he\u0027d been the only one to know her. To him, it probably would have seemed like hearing anyone. \"Just a few minutes,\" Rose said. \"We would have called you soon. She\u0027s been asking for you - demandingmight be a better description. Esme sacrificed her second-best silver service to keep the little monster entertained.\" Rose smiled at Renesmee with so much gloating affection that the criticism was entirely weightless. \"We didn\u0027t want to... er, bother you.\" Rosalie bit her lip and looked away, trying not to laugh. I could feel Emmett\u0027s silent laughter behind me, sending vibrations through the foundations of the house. I kept my chin high. \"We\u0027ll get your room set up right away,\" I said to Renesmee. \"You\u0027ll like the cottage. It\u0027s magic.\" I look up at Esme. \"Thank you, Esme. So much. It\u0027s absolutely perfect.\" Before Esme could respond, Emmett was laughing again - it wasn\u0027t silent this time. \"So it\u0027s still standing?\" he managed to get out between his snickers. \"I would\u0027ve thought you two had knocked it to rubble by now. What were you doing last night? Discussing the national debt?\" He howled with laughter. I gritted my teeth and reminded myself of the negative consequences when I\u0027d let my temper get away from me yesterday. Of course, Emmett wasn\u0027t as breakable as Seth___ Thinking of Seth made me wonder. \"Where\u0027re the wolves today?\" I glanced out the window wall, but there had been no sign of Leah on the way in. \"Jacob took off this morning pretty early,\" Rosalie told me, a little frown creasing her forehead. \"Seth followed him out.\" \"What was he so upset about?\" Edward asked as he came back into the room with Renesmee\u0027s cup. There must have been more in Rosalie\u0027s memory than I\u0027d seen in her expression. Without breathing, I handed Renesmee off to Rosalie. Super-self-control, maybe, but there was no way I was going to be able to feed her. Not yet. \"I don\u0027t know - or care,\" Rosalie grumbled, but she answered Edward\u0027s question more fully. \"He was watching Nessie sleep, his mouth hanging open like the moron he is, and then he just jumped to his feet without any kind of trigger - that I noticed, anyway - and stormed out. was glad to be rid of him. The more time he spends here, the less chance there is that we\u0027ll ever get the smell out.\" \"Rose,\" Esme chided gently. Rosalie flipped her hair. \"I suppose it doesn\u0027t matter. We won\u0027t be here that much longer.\" \"I still say we should go straight to New Hampshire and get things set up,\" Emmett said, obviously continuing an earlier conversation. \"Bella\u0027s already registered at Dartmouth. Doesn\u0027t look like it will take her all that long to be able to handle school.\" He turned to look at me with a teasing grin. Tm sure you\u0027ll ace your classes... apparently there\u0027s nothing interesting for you to do at night besides study.\" Rosalie giggled. Do not lose your temper, do not lose your temper,I chanted to myself. And then I was proud of myself for keeping my head. So I was pretty surprised that Edward didn\u0027t. He growled - an abrupt, shocking rasp of sound - and the blackest fury rolled across his expression like storm clouds. Before any of us could respond, Alice was on her feet. \"What is he doing? What is that dog doing that has erased my schedule for the entire day? I can\u0027t see anything] No!\" She shot me a tortured glance. \"Look at you! You neec/meto show you how to use your closet.\" For one second I was grateful for whatever Jacob was up to. And then Edward\u0027s hands balled up into fists and he snarled, \"He talked to Charlie. He thinks Charlie is following after him. Coming here. Today.\" Alice said a word that sounded very odd in her trilling, ladylike voice, and then she blurred into motion, streaking out the backdoor. \"He told Charlie?\" I gasped. \"But - doesn\u0027t he understand? How could he do that?\" Charlie couldn\u0027t know about me! About vampires! That would put him on a hit list that even the Cullens couldn\u0027t save him from. \"No!\" Edward spoke through his teeth. \"Jacob\u0027s on his way in now.\" It must have started raining farther east. Jacob came through the door shaking his wet hair like a dog, flipping droplets on the carpet and the couch where they made little round gray spots on the white. His teeth glinted against his dark lips; his eyes were bright and excited. He walked with jerky movements, like he was all hyped-up about destroying my father\u0027s life. \"Hey, guys,\" he greeted us, grinning. It was perfectly silent. Leah and Seth slipped in behind him, in their human forms - for now; both of their hands were trembling with the tension in the room. \"Rose,\" I said, holding my arms out. Wordlessly, Rosalie handed me Renesmee. I pressed her close to my motionless heart, holding her like a talisman against rash behavior. I would keep her in my arms until I was sure my decision to kill Jacob was based entirely on rational judgment rather than fury. She was very still, watching and listening. How much did she understand? \"Charlie\u0027ll be here soon,\" Jacob said to me casually. \"Just a heads-up. I assume Alice is getting you sunglasses or something?\" \"You assume way too much,\" I spit through my teeth. \"What. Have. You. Done?\" Jacob\u0027s smile wavered, but he was still too wound up to answer seriously. \"Biondie and Emmett woke me up this morning going on and on about you all moving cross-country. Like I could let you leave. Charlie was the biggest issue there, right? Well, problem solved.\u00277 \"Do you even realize what you\u0027ve done? The danger you\u0027ve put him in?\" He snorted. \"I didn\u0027t put him in danger. Except from you. But you\u0027ve got some kind of supernatural self-control, right? Not as good as mind reading, if you ask me. Much less exciting.\" Edward moved then, darting across the room to get in Jacob\u0027s face. Though he was half a head shorter than Jacob, Jacob leaned away from his staggering anger as if Edward towered over him. \"That\u0027s just a theory, mongrel,\" he snarled. \"You think we should test it out on Charlie? Did you consider the physical pain you\u0027re putting Bella through, even if she can resist? Or the emotional pain if she doesn\u0027t? I suppose what happens to Bella no longer concerns you!\" He spit the last word. Renesmee pressed her fingers anxiously to my cheek, anxiety coloring the replay in her head. Edward\u0027s words finally cut through Jacob\u0027s strangely electric mood. His mouth dropped into a frown. \"Bella will be in pain?\" \"Like you\u0027ve shoved a white-hot branding iron down her throat!\" I flinched, remembering the scent of pure human blood. \"I didn\u0027t know that,\" Jacob whispered. \"Then perhaps you should have asked first,\" Edward growled back through his teeth. \"You would have stopped me.\" \"You should have been stopped - \" \"This isn\u0027t about me,\" I interrupted. I stood very still, keeping my hold on Renesmee and sanity. \"This is about Charlie, Jacob. How could you put him in danger this way? Do you realize it\u0027s death or vampire life for him now, too?\" My voice trembled with the tears my eyes could no longer shed. Jacob was still troubled by Edward\u0027s accusations, but mine didn\u0027t seem to bother him. \"Relax, Bella. I didn\u0027t tell him anything you weren\u0027t planning to tell him.\" \"But he\u0027s coming here!\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s the idea. Wasn\u0027t the whole let him make the wrong assumptions\u0027 thing your plan? I think I provided a very nice red herring, if I do say so myself.\" My fingers flexed away from Renesmee. I curled them back in securely. \"Say it straight, Jacob. I don\u0027t have the patience for this.\" \"I didn\u0027t tell him anything about you, Bella. Not really. I told him about me. Well, show is probably a better verb.\" \"He phased in front of Charlie,\" Edward hissed. I whispered, \"You what?\" \"He\u0027s brave. Brave as you are. Didn\u0027t pass out or throw up or anything. I gotta say, I was impressed. You should\u0027ve seen his face when I started taking my clothes off, though. Priceless,\" Jacob chortled. \"You absolute moronl You could have given him a heart attack!\" \"Charlie\u0027s fine. He\u0027s tough. If you\u0027d give this just a minute, you\u0027ll see that I did you a favor here.\" \"You have half of that, Jacob.\" My voice was flat and steely. \"You have thirty seconds to tell me every single word before I give Renesmee to Rosalie and rip your miserable head off. Seth won\u0027t be able to stop me this time.\" \"Jeez, Bells. You didn\u0027t used to be so melodramatic. Is that a vampire thing?\" \"Twenty-six seconds.\" Jacob rolled his eyes and flopped into the nearest chair. His little pack moved to stand on his flanks, not at all relaxed the way he seemed to be; Leah\u0027s eyes were on me, her teeth slightly bared. \"So I knocked on Charlie\u0027s door this morning and asked him to come for a walk with me. He was confused, but when I told him it was about you and that you were back in town, he followed me out to the woods. I told him you weren\u0027t sick anymore, and that things were a little weird, but good. He was about to take off to see you, but I told him I had to show him something first. And then I phased.\" Jacob shrugged. My teeth felt like a vise was pushing them together. \"I want every word, you monster.\" \"Well, you said I only had thirty seconds - okay, okay.\" My expression must have convinced him that I wasn\u0027t in the mood for teasing. \"Lemme see... I phased back and got dressed, and then after he started breathing again, I said something like, \u0027Charlie, you don\u0027t live in the world you thought you lived in. The good news is, nothing has changed - except that now you know. Life\u0027ll go on the same way it always has. You can go right back to pretending that you don\u0027t believe any of this.\u0027 \"It took him a minute to get his head together, and then he wanted to know what was really going on with you, with the whole rare-disease thing. I told him that you had been sick, but you were fine now - it was just that you\u0027d had to change a little bit in the process of getting better. He wanted to know what I meant by \u0027change,\u0027 and I told him that you looked a lot more like Esme now than you looked like Renee.\" Edward hissed while I stared in horror; this was headed in a dangerous direction. \"After a few minutes, he asked, real quietly, if you turned into an animal, too. And I said, \u0027She wishes she was that cool!\u0027\" Jacob chuckled. Rosalie made a noise of disgust. \"I started to tell him more about werewolves, but I didn\u0027t even get the whole word out - Charlie cut me off and said he\u0027d \u0027rather not know the specifics.\u0027 Then he asked if you\u0027d known what you were getting yourself into when you married Edward, and I said, \u0027Sure, she\u0027s known all about this for years, since she first came to Forks.\u0027 He didn\u0027t like that very much. I let him rant till he got it out of his system. After he got calmed down, he just wanted two things. He wanted to see you, and I said it would be better if he gave me a head start to explain.\" I inhaled deeply. \"What was the other thing he wanted?\" Jacob smiled. \"You\u0027ll like this. His main request is that he be told as little as possible about all of this. If it\u0027s not absolutely essential for him to know something, then keep it to yourself. Need to know, only.\" I felt relief for the first time since Jacob had walked in. \"I can handle that part.\" \"Other than that, he\u0027d just like to pretend things are normal.\" Jacob\u0027s smile turned smug; he must suspect that I would be starting to feel the first faint stirrings of gratitude about now. \"What did you tell him about Renesmee?\" I struggled to maintain the razor edge in my voice, fighting the reluctant appreciation. It was premature. There was still so much wrong with this situation. Even if Jacob\u0027s intervention had brought out a better reaction in Charlie than I\u0027d ever hoped for... \"Oh yeah. So I told him that you and Edward had inherited a new little mouth to feed.\" He glanced at Edward. \"She\u0027s your orphaned ward - like Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson.\" Jacob snorted. \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d mind me lying. That\u0027s all part of the game, right?\" Edward didn\u0027t respond in any way, so Jacob went on. \"Charlie was way past being shocked at this point, but he did ask if you were adopting her. \u0027Like a daughter? Like I\u0027m sort of a grandfather?\u0027 were his exact words. I told him yes. \u0027Congrats, Gramps, and all of that. He even smiled a little.\" The stinging returned to my eyes, but not out of fear or anguish this time. Charlie was smiling at the idea of being a grandpa? Charlie would meet Renesmee? \"But she\u0027s changing so fast,\" I whispered. \"I told him that she was more special than all of us put together,\" Jacob said in a soft voice. He stood and walked right up to me, waving Leah and Seth off when they started to follow. Renesmee reached out to him, but I hugged her more tightly to me. \"I told him, Trust me, you don\u0027t want to know about this. But if you can ignore all the strange parts, you\u0027re going to be amazed. She\u0027s the most wonderful person in the whole world.\u0027 And then I told him that if he could deal with that, you all would stick around for a while and he would have a chance to get to know her. But that if it was too much for him, you would leave. He said as long as no one forced too much information on him, he\u0027d deal.\" Jacob stared at me with half a smile, waiting. \"I\u0027m not going to say thank you,\" I told him. \"You\u0027re still putting Charlie at a huge risk.\" \"I am sorry about it hurting you. I didn\u0027t know it was like that. Bella, things are different with us now, but you\u0027ll always be my best friend, and I\u0027ll always love you. But I\u0027ll love you the right way now. There\u0027s finally a balance. We both have people we can\u0027t live without.\" He smiled his very most Jacob-y smile. \"Still friends?\" Try as hard as I could to resist, I had to smile back. Just a tiny smile. He held out his hand: an offer. I took a deep breath and shifted Renesmee\u0027s weight to one arm. I put my left hand in his - he didn\u0027t even flinch at the feel of my cool skin. \"If I don\u0027t kill Charlie tonight, I\u0027ll consider forgiving you for this.\" \"Whenyou don\u0027t kill Charlie tonight, you\u0027ll owe me huge.\" I rolled my eyes. He held out his other hand toward Renesmee, a request this time. \"Can I?\" \"I\u0027m actually holding her so that my hands aren\u0027t free to kill you, Jacob. Maybe later.\" He sighed but didn\u0027t push me on it. Wise of him. Alice raced back through the door then, her hands full and her expression promising violence. \"You, you, and you,\" she snapped, glaring at the werewolves. \"If you must stay, get over in the corner and commit to being there for a while. I need to see. Bella, you\u0027d better give him the baby, too. You\u0027ll need your arms free, anyway.\" Jacob grinned in triumph. Undiluted fear ripped through my stomach as the enormity of what I was about to do hit me. I was going to gamble on my iffy self-control with my pure human father as the guinea pig. Edward\u0027s earlier words crashed in my ears again. Did you consider the physical pain you\u0027re putting Bella through, even if she can resist? Or the emotional pain if she doesn\u0027t? I couldn\u0027t imagine the pain of failure. My breathing turned to gasps. \"Take her,\" I whispered, sliding Renesmee into Jacob\u0027s arms. He nodded, concern wrinkling his forehead. He gestured to the others, and they all went to the far corner of the room. Seth and Jake slouched on the floor at once, but Leah shook her head and pursed her lips. \"Am I allowed to leave?\" she griped. She looked uncomfortable in her human body, wearing the same dirty t-shirt and cotton shorts she\u0027d worn to shriek at me the other day, her short hair sticking up in irregular tufts. Her hands were still shaking. \"Of course,\" Jake said. \"Stay east so you don\u0027t cross Charlie\u0027s path,\" Alice added. Leah didn\u0027t look at Alice; she ducked out the back door and stomped into the bushes to phase. Edward was back at my side, stroking my face. \"You can do this. I know you can. Ill help you; we all will.\" I met Edward\u0027s eyes with panic screaming from my face. Was he strong enough to stop me if I made a wrong move? \"If I didn\u0027t believe you could handle it, we\u0027d disappear today. This very minute. But you can. And you\u0027ll be happier if you can have Charlie in your life.\" I tried to slow my breathing. Alice held out her hand. There was a small white box on her palm. \"These will irritate your eyes - they won\u0027t hurt, but they\u0027ll cloud your vision. It\u0027s annoying. They also won\u0027t match your old color, but it\u0027s still better than bright red, right?\" She flipped the contact box into the air and I caught it. \"When did you - \" \"Before you left on the honeymoon. I was prepared for several possible futures.\" I nodded and opened the container. I\u0027d never worn contacts before, but it couldn\u0027t be that hard. I took the little brown quarter-sphere and pressed it, concave side in, to my eye. I blinked, and a film interrupted my sight. I could see through it, of course, but I could also see the texture of the thin screen. My eye kept focusing on the microscopic scratches and warped sections. \"I see what you mean,\" I murmured as I stuck the other one in. I tried to not blink this time. My eye automatically wanted to dislodge the obstruction. \"How do I look?\" Edward smiled. \"Gorgeous. Of course - \" \"Yes, yes, she always looks gorgeous,\" Alice finished his thought impatiently. \"It\u0027s better than red, but that\u0027s the highest commendation I can give. Muddy brown. Your brown was much prettier. Keep in mind that those won\u0027t last forever - the venom in your eyes will dissolve them in a few hours. So if Charlie stays longer than that, you\u0027ll have to excuse yourself to replace them. Which is a good idea anyway, because humans need bathroom breaks.\" She shook her head. \"Esme, give her a few pointers on acting human while I stock the powder room with contacts.\" \"How long do I have?\" \"Charlie will be here in five minutes. Keep it simple.\" Esme nodded once and came to take my hand. \"The main thing is not to sit too still or move too fast,\" she told me. \"Sit down if he does,\" Emmett interjected. \"Humans don\u0027t like to just stand there.\" \"Let your eyes wander every thirty seconds or so,\" Jasper added. \"Humans don\u0027t stare at one thing for too long.\" \"Cross your legs for about five minutes, then switch to crossing your ankles for the next five,\" Rosalie said. I nodded once at each suggestion. I\u0027d noticed them doing some of these things yesterday. I thought I could mimic their actions. \"And blink at least three times a minute,\" Emmett said. He frowned, then darted to where the television remote sat on the end table. He flipped the TV on to a college football game and nodded to himself. \"Move your hands, too. Brush your hair back or pretend to scratch something,\" Jasper said. \"I said Esme\" Alice complained as she returned. \"You\u0027ll overwhelm her.\" \"No, I think I got it all,\" I said. \"Sit, look around, blink, fidget.\" \"Right,\" Esme approved. She hugged my shoulders. Jasper frowned. \"You\u0027ll be holding your breath as much as possible, but you need to move your shoulders a little to make it /oo/clike you\u0027re breathing.\" I inhaled once and then nodded again. Edward hugged me on my free side. \"You can do this,\" he repeated, murmuring the encouragement in my ear. \"Two minutes,\" Alice said. \"Maybe you should start out already on the couch. You\u0027ve been sick, after all. That way he won\u0027t have to see you move right at first.\" Alice pulled me to the sofa. I tried to move slowly, to make my limbs more clumsy. She rolled her eyes, so I must not have been doing a good job. \"Jacob, I need Renesmee,\" I said. Jacob frowned, unmoving. Alice shook her head. \"Bella, that doesn\u0027t help me see.\" \"But I need her. She keeps me calm.\u00277The edge of panic in my voice was unmistakable. \"Fine,\" Alice groaned. \"Hold her as still as you can and I\u0027ll try to see around her.\" She sighed wearily, like she\u0027d been asked to work overtime on a holiday. Jacob sighed, too, but brought Renesmee to me, and then retreated quickly from Alice\u0027s glare. Edward took a seat beside me and put his arms around Renesmee and me. He leaned forward and looked Renesmee very seriously in the eyes. \"Renesmee, someone special is coming to see you and your mother,\" he said in a solemn voice, as if he expected her to understand every word. Did she? She looked back at him with clear, grave eyes. \"But he\u0027s not like us, or even like Jacob. We have to be very careful with him. You shouldn\u0027t tell him things the way you tell us.\" Renesmee touched his face. \"Exactly,\" he said. \"And he\u0027s going to make you thirsty. But you mustn\u0027t bite him. He won\u0027t heal like Jacob.\" \"Can she understand you?\" I whispered. \"She understands. You\u0027ll be careful, won\u0027t you, Renesmee? You\u0027ll help us?\" Renesmee touched him again. \"No, I don\u0027t care if you bite Jacob. That\u0027s fine.\" Jacob chuckled. \"Maybe you should leave, Jacob,\" Edward said coldly, glaring in his direction. Edward hadn\u0027t forgiven Jacob, because he knew that no matter what happened now, I was going to be hurting. But I\u0027d take the burn happily if that were the worst thing I\u0027d face tonight. \"I told Charlie I\u0027d be here,\" Jacob said. \"He needs the moral support.\" \"Moral support,\" Edward scoffed. \"As far as Charlie knows, you\u0027re the most repulsive monster of us all.\" \"Repulsive?\" Jake protested, and then he laughed quietly to himself. I heard the tires turn off the highway onto the quiet, damp earth of the Cullens\u0027 drive, and my breathing spiked again. My heart ought to have been hammering. It made me anxious that my body didn\u0027t have the right reactions. I concentrated on the steady thrumming of Renesmee\u0027s heart to calm myself. It worked pretty quickly. \"Well done, Bella,\" Jasper whispered in approval. Edward tightened his arm over my shoulders. \"You\u0027re sure?\" I asked him. \"Positive. You can do anything\" He smiled and kissed me. It wasn\u0027t precisely a peck on the lips, and my wild vampiric reactions took me off guard yet again. Edward\u0027s lips were like a shot of some addictive chemical straight into my nervous system. I was instantly craving more. It took all my concentration to remember the baby in my arms. Jasper felt my mood change. \"Er, Edward, you might not want to distract her like that right now. She needs to be able to focus.\" Edward pulled away. \"Oops,\" he said. I laughed. That had been my line from the very beginning, from the very first kiss. \"Later,\" I said, and anticipation curled my stomach into a ball. \"Focus, Bella,\" Jasper urged. \"Right.\" i pushed the trembly feelings away. Charlie, that was the main thing now. Keep Charlie safe today. We would have all night___ \"Bella.\" \"Sorry, Jasper.\" Emmett laughed. The sound of Charlie\u0027s cruiser got closer and closer. The second of levity passed, and everyone was still. I crossed my legs and practiced my blinks. The car pulled in front of the house and idled for a few seconds. I wondered if Charlie was as nervous as I was. Then the engine cut off, and a door slammed. Three steps across the grass, and then eight echoing thuds against the wooden stairs. Four more echoing footsteps across the porch. Then silence. Charlie took two deep breaths. Knock, knock, knock. I inhaled for what might be the last time. Renesmee nestled deeper into my arms, hiding her face in my hair. Carlisle answered the door. His stressed expression changed to one of welcome, like switching the channel on the TV. \"Hello, Charlie,\" he said, looking appropriately abashed. After all, we were supposed to be in Atlanta at the Center for Disease Control. Charlie knew he\u0027d been lied to. \"Carlisle,\" Charlie greeted him stiffly. \"Where\u0027s Bella?\" \"Right here, Dad.\" Ugh! My voice was so wrong. Plus, I\u0027d used up some of my air supply. I gulped in a quick refill, glad that Charlie\u0027s scent had not saturated the room yet. Charlie\u0027s blank expression told me how off my voice was. His eyes zeroed in on me and widened. I read the emotions as they scrolled across his face. Shock. Disbelief. Pain. Loss. Fear. Anger. Suspicion. More pain. I bit my lip. It felt funny. My new teeth were sharper against my granite skin than my human teeth had been against my soft human lips. \"Is that you, Bella?\" he whispered. \"Yep.\" I winced at my wind-chime voice. \"Hi, Dad.\" He took a deep breath to steady himself. \"Hey, Charlie,\" Jacob greeted him from the corner. \"How\u0027re things?\" Charlie glowered at Jacob once, shuddered at a memory, and then stared at me again. Slowly, Charlie walked across the room until he was a few feet away from me. He darted an accusing glare at Edward, and then his eyes flickered back to me. The warmth of his body heat beat against me with each pulse of his heart. \"Bella?\" heasked again. I spoke in a lower voice, trying to keep the ring out of it.\"It\u0027s really me.\" His jaw locked. \"I\u0027m sorry, Dad,\" I said. \"Are you okay?\" he demanded. \"Really and truly great,\" I promised. \"Healthy as a horse.\" That was it for my oxygen. \"Jake told me this was... necessary. That you were dying.\" He said the words like he didn\u0027t believe them one bit. I steeled myself, focused on Renesmee\u0027s warm weight, leaned into Edward for support, and took a deep breath. Charlie\u0027s scent was a fistful of flames, punching straight down my throat. But it was so much more than pain. It was a hot stabbing of desire, too. Charlie smelled more delicious than anything I\u0027d ever imagined. As appealing as the anonymous hikers had been on the hunt, Charlie was doubly tempting. And he was just a few feet away, leaking mouthwatering heat and moisture into the dry air. But I wasn\u0027t hunting now. And this was my father. Edward squeezed my shoulders sympathetically, and Jacob shot an apologetic glance at me across the room. I tried to collect myself and ignore the pain and longing of the thirst. Charlie was waiting for my answer. \"Jacob was telling you the truth.\" \"That makes one of you,\" Charlie growled. I hoped Charlie could see past the changes in my new face to read the remorse there. Under my hair, Renesmee sniffed as Charlie\u0027s scent registered with her, too. I tightened my grip on her. Charlie saw my anxious glance down and followed it. \"Oh,\" he said, and all the anger fell off his face, leaving only shock behind. \"This is her. The orphan Jacob said you\u0027re adopting.\" \"My niece,\" Edward lied smoothly. He must have decided that the resemblance between Renesmee and him was too pronounced to be ignored. Best to claim they were related from the beginning. \"I thought you\u0027d lost your family,\" Charlie said, accusation returning to his voice. \"I lost my parents. My older brother was adopted, like me. I never saw him after that. But the courts located me when he and his wife died in a car accident, leaving their only child without any other family.\" Edward was so good at this. His voice was even, with just the right amount of innocence. I needed practice so that I could do that. Renesmee peeked out from under my hair, sniffing again. She glanced shyly at Charlie from under her long lashes, then hid again. \"She\u0027s... she\u0027s,well, she\u0027s a beauty.\" \"Yes,\" Edward agreed. \"Kind of a big responsibility, though. You two are just getting started.\" \"What else could we do?\" Edward brushed his fingers lightly over her cheek. I saw him touch her lips for just a moment - a reminder. \"Would you have refused her?\" \"Hmph. Well.\" Heshook his head absently. \"Jake says you call her Nessie?\" \"No, we don\u0027t,\" I said, my voice too sharp and piercing. \"Her name is Renesmee.\" Charlie refocused on me. \"How do you feel about this? Maybe Carlisle and Esme could - \" \"She\u0027s mine,\" I interrupted. \"I want her.\" Charlie frowned. \"You gonna make me a grandpa so young?\" Edward smiled. \"Carlisle is a grandfather, too.\" Charlie shot an incredulous glance at Carlisle, still standing by the front door; he looked like Zeus\u0027s younger, better-looking brother. Charlie snorted and then laughed. \"I guess that does sort of make me feel better.\"His eyes strayed back to Renesmee. \"She sure is something to look at.\" His warm breath blew lightly across the space between us. Renesmee leaned toward the smell, shaking off my hair and looking him full in the face for the first time. Charlie gasped. I knew what he was seeing. My eyes - his eyes - copied exactly into her perfect face. Charlie started hyperventilating. His lips trembled, and I could read the numbers he mouthed. He was counting backward, trying to fit nine months into one. Trying to put it together but not able to force the evidence right in front of him to make any sense. Jacob got up and came over to pat Charlie on the back. He leaned in to whisper something in Charlie\u0027s ear; only Charlie didn\u0027t know we could all hear. \"Need to know, Charlie. It\u0027s okay. I promise.\" Charlie swallowed and nodded. And then his eyes blazed as he took a step closer to Edward with his fists tightly clenched. \"I don\u0027t want to know everything, but I\u0027m done with the lies!\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Edward said calmly, \"but you need to know the public story more than you need to know the truth. If you\u0027re going to be part of this secret, the public story is the one that counts. It\u0027s to protect Bella and Renesmee as well as the rest of us. Can you go along with the lies for them?\" The room wasfull of statues. I crossed my ankles. Charlie huffed once and then turned his glare on me. \"You might\u0027ve given me some warning, kid.\" \"Would it really have made this any easier?\" He frowned, and then he knelt on the floor in front of me. I could see the movement of the blood in his neck under his skin. I could feel the warm vibration of it. So could Renesmee. She smiled and reached one pink palm out to him. I held her back. She pushed her other hand against my neck, thirst, curiosity, and Charlie\u0027s face in her thoughts. There was a subtle edge to the message that made me think that she\u0027d understood Edward\u0027s words perfectly; she acknowledged thirst, but overrode it in the same thought. \"Whoa,\" Charlie gasped, his eyes on her perfect teeth. \"How old is she?\" \"Urn...\" \"Three months,\" Edward said, and then added slowly, \"rather, she\u0027s the size of a three-month-old, more or less. She\u0027s younger in some ways, more mature in others.\" Very deliberately, Renesmee waved at him. Charlie blinked spastically. Jacob elbowed him. \"Told you she was special, didn\u0027t I?\" Charlie cringed away from the contact. \"Oh, c\u0027mon, Charlie,\" Jacob groaned. \"I\u0027m the same person I\u0027ve always been. Just pretend this afternoon didn\u0027t happen.\" The reminder made Charlie\u0027s lips go white, but he nodded once. \"Just what is your part in all this, Jake?\" he asked. \"How much does Billy know? Why are you here?\" He looked at Jacob\u0027s face, which was glowing as he stared at Renesmee. \"Well, I could tell you all about it - Billy knows absolutely everything - but it involves a lot of stuff about werewo - \" \"Ungh!\" Charlie protested, covering his ears. \"Never mind.\" Jacob grinned. \"Everything\u0027s going to be great, Charlie. Just try to not believe anything you see.\" My dad mumbled something unintelligible. \"Woo!\" Emmett suddenly boomed in his deep bass. \"Go Gators!\" Jacob and Charlie jumped. The rest of us froze. Charlie recovered, then looked at Emmett over his shoulder. \"Florida winning?\" \"Just scored the first touchdown,\" Emmett confirmed. He shot a look in my direction, wagging his eyebrows like a villain in vaudeville. \"\u0027Bout time somebody scored around here.\" I fought back a hiss. In front of Charlie? That was over the line. But Charlie was beyond noticing innuendos. He took yet another deep breath, sucking the air in like he was trying to pull it down to his toes. I envied him. He lurched to his feet, stepped around Jacob, and half-fell into an open chair. \"Well,\" he sighed, \"I guess we should see if they can hold on to the lead.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-4-breaking-dawn-twilight-4/page-27.html","bookId":2026,"book":{"id":2026,"title":"The Twilight Saga 4: Breaking Dawn (Twilight #4)","description":"Storyline: Breaking Dawn is the fourth novel in the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer.
