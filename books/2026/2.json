{"id":108072,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"No one is staring at you,I promised myself. No one is staring at you. No one is staring at you. But, because I couldn\u0027t lie convincingly even to myself, I had to check. As I sat waiting for one of the three traffic lights in town to turn green, I peeked to the right - in her minivan, Mrs. Weber had turned her whole torso in my direction. Her eyes bored into mine, and I flinched back, wondering why she didn\u0027t drop her gaze or look ashamed. It was still considered rude to stare at people, wasn\u0027t it? Didn\u0027t that apply to me anymore? Then I remembered that these windows were so darkly tinted that she probably had no idea if it was even me in here, let alone that I\u0027d caught her looking. I tried to take some comfort in the fact that she wasn\u0027t really staring at me, just the car. Mycar. Sigh. I glanced to the left and groaned. Two pedestrians were frozen on the sidewalk, missing their chance to cross as they stared. Behind them, Mr. Marshall was gawking through the plate-glass window of his little souvenir shop. At least he didn\u0027t have his nose pressed up against the glass. Yet. The light turned green and, in my hurry to escape, I stomped on the gas pedal without thinking - the normal way I would have punched it to get my ancient Chevy truck moving. Engine snarling like a hunting panther, the car jolted forward so fast that my body slammed into the black leather seat and my stomach flattened against my spine. \"Arg!\" I gasped as I fumbled for the brake. Keeping my head, I merely tapped the pedal. The car lurched to an absolute standstill anyway. I couldn\u0027t bear to look around at the reaction. If there had been any doubt as to who was driving this car before, it was gone now. With the toe of my shoe, I gently nudged the gas pedal down one half millimeter, and the car shot forward again. I managed to reach my goal, the gas station. If I hadn\u0027t been running on vapors, I wouldn\u0027t have come into town at all. I was going without a lot of things these days, like Pop-Tarts and shoelaces, to avoid spending time in public. Moving as if I were in a race, I got the hatch open, the cap off, the card scanned, and the nozzle in the tank within seconds. Of course, there was nothing I could do to make the numbers on the gauge pick up the pace. They ticked by sluggishly, almost as if they were doing it just to annoy me. It wasn\u0027t bright out - a typical drizzly day in Forks, Washington - but I still felt like a spotlight was trained on me, drawing attention to the delicate ring on my left hand. At times like this, sensing the eyes on my back, it felt as if the ring were pulsing like a neon sign: Look at me, look at me. It was stupid to be so self-conscious, and I knew that. Besides my dad and mom, did it really matter what people were saying about my engagement? About my new car? About my mysterious acceptance into an Ivy League college? About the shiny black credit card that felt red-hot in my back pocket right now? \"Yeah, who cares what they think,\" I muttered under my breath. \"Urn, miss?\" a man\u0027s voice called. I turned, and then wished I hadn\u0027t. Two men stood beside a fancy SUV with brand-new kayaks tied to the top. Neither of them was looking at me; they both were staring at the car. Personally, I didn\u0027t get it. But then, I was just proud I could distinguish between the symbols for Toyota, Ford, and Chevy. This car was glossy black, sleek, and pretty, but it was still just a car to me. \"I\u0027m sorry to bother you, but could you tell me what kind of car you\u0027re driving?\" the tall one asked. \"Urn, a Mercedes, right?\" \"Yes,\" the man said politely while his shorter friend rolled his eyes at my answer. \"I know. But I was wondering, is that... are you driving a Mercedes Guardian?\" The man said the name with reverence. I had a feeling this guy would get along well with Edward Cullen, my... my fiance (there really was no getting around that truth with the wedding just days away). \"They aren\u0027t supposed to be available in Europe yet,\" the man went on, \"let alone here.\" While his eyes traced the contours of my car - it didn\u0027t look much different from any other Mercedes sedan to me, but what did I know? - I briefly contemplated my issues with words like fiance, wedding, husband, etc. I just couldn\u0027t put it together in my head. On the one hand, I had been raised to cringe at the very thought of poofy white dresses and bouquets. But more than that, I just couldn\u0027t reconcile a staid, respectable, dull concept like husband with my concept of Edward. It was like casting an archangel as an accountant; I couldn\u0027t visualize him in any commonplace role. Like always, as soon as I started thinking about Edward I was caught up in a dizzy spin of fantasies. The stranger had to clear his throat to get my attention; he was still waiting for an answer about the car\u0027s make and model. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I told him honestly. \"Do you mind if I take a picture with it?\" It took me a second to process that. \"Really? You want to take a picture with the car?\" \"Sure - nobody is going to believe me if I don\u0027t get proof.\" \"Urn. Okay. Fine.\" I swiftly put away the nozzle and crept into the front seat to hide while the enthusiast dug a huge professional-looking camera out of his backpack. He and his friend took turns posing by the hood, and then they went to take pictures at the back end. \"I miss my truck,\" I whimpered to myself. Very, very convenient - too convenient - that my truck would wheeze its last wheeze just weeks after Edward and I had agreed to our lopsided compromise, one detail of which was that he be allowed to replace my truck when it passed on. Edward swore it was only to be expected; my truck had lived a long, full life and then expired of natural causes. According to him. And, of course, I had no way to verify his story or to try to raise my truck from the dead on my own. My favorite mechanic - I stopped that thought cold, refusing to let it come to a conclusion. Instead, I listened to the men\u0027s voices outside, muted by the car walls. \"... went at it with a flamethrower in the online video. Didn\u0027t even pucker the paint.\" \"Of course not. You could roll a tank over this baby. Not much of a market for one over here. Designed for Middle East diplomats, arms dealers, and drug lords mostly.\" \"Think she\u0027s something?\" the short one asked in a softer voice. I ducked my head, cheeks flaming. \"Huh,\" the tall one said. \"Maybe. Can\u0027t imagine what you\u0027d need missile-proof glass and four thousand pounds of body armor for around here. Must be headed somewhere more hazardous.\" Body armor. Four thousand pounds of body armor. And missile-proof glass? Nice. What had happened to good old-fashioned bulletproof? Well, at least this made some sense - if you had a twisted sense of humor. It wasn\u0027t like I hadn\u0027t expected Edward to take advantage of our deal, to weight it on his side so that he could give so much more than he would receive. I\u0027d agreed that he could replace my truck when it needed replacing, not expecting that moment to come quite so soon, of course. When I\u0027d been forced to admit that the truck had become no more than a still-life tribute to classic Chevys on my curb, I knew his idea of a replacement was probably going to embarrass me. Make me the focus of stares and whispers. I\u0027d been right about that part. But even in my darkest imaginings I had not foreseen that he would get me two cars. The \"before\" car and the \"after\" car, he\u0027d explained when I\u0027d flipped out. This was just the \"before\" car. He\u0027d told me it was a loaner and promised that he was returning it after the wedding. It all had made absolutely no sense to me. Until now. Ha ha. Because I was so fragilely human, so accident-prone, so much a victim to my own dangerous bad luck, apparently I needed a tank-resistant car to keep me safe. Hilarious. I was sure he and his brothers had enjoyed the joke quite a bit behind my back. Or maybe, just maybe,a small voice whispered in my head, it\u0027s not a joke, silly. Maybe he\u0027s really that worried about you. This wouldn\u0027t be the first time he\u0027s gone a little overboard trying to protect you. I sighed. I hadn\u0027t seen the \"after\" car yet. It was hidden under a sheet in the deepest corner of the Cullens\u0027 garage. I knew most people would have peeked by now, but I really didn\u0027t want to know. Probably no body armor on that car - because I wouldn\u0027t need it after the honeymoon. Virtual indestructibility was just one of the many perks I was looking forward to. The best parts about being a Cullen were not expensive cars and impressive credit cards. \"Hey,\" the tall man called, cupping his hands to the glass in an effort to peer in. \"We\u0027re done now. Thanks a lot!\" \"You\u0027re welcome,\" I called back, and then tensed as I started the engine and eased the pedal - ever so gently - down___ No matter how many times I drove down the familiar road home, I still couldn\u0027t make the rain-faded flyers fade into the background. Each one of them, stapled to telephone poles and taped to street signs, was like a fresh slap in the face. A well-deserved slap in the face. My mind was sucked back into the thought I\u0027d interrupted so immediately before. I couldn\u0027t avoid it on this road. Not with pictures of my favorite mechanic flashing past me at regular intervals. My best friend. My Jacob. Thehave you SEENthis boy? posters were not Jacob\u0027s father\u0027s idea. It had been my father, Charlie, who\u0027d printed up the flyers and spread them all over town. And not just Forks, but Port Angeles and Sequim and Hoquiam and Aberdeen and every other town in the Olympic Peninsula. He\u0027d made sure that all the police stations in the state of Washington had the same flyer hanging on the wall, too. His own station had a whole corkboard dedicated to finding Jacob. A corkboard that was mostly empty, much to his disappointment and frustration. My dad was disappointed with more than the lack of response. He was most disappointed with Billy, Jacob\u0027s father - and Charlie\u0027s closest friend. For Billy\u0027s not being more involved with the search for his sixteen-year-old \"runaway.\" For Billy\u0027s refusing to put up the flyers in La Push, the reservation on the coast that was Jacob\u0027s home. For his seeming resigned to Jacob\u0027s disappearance, as if there was nothing he could do. For his saying, \"Jacob\u0027s grown up now. He\u0027ll come home if he wants to.\" And he was frustrated with me, for taking Billy\u0027s side. I wouldn\u0027t put up posters, either. Because both Billy and I knew where Jacob was, roughly speaking, and we also knew that no one had seen this boy. The flyers put the usual big, fat lump in my throat, the usual stinging tears in my eyes, and I was glad Edward was out hunting this Saturday. If Edward saw my reaction, it would only make him feel terrible, too. Of course, there were drawbacks to it being Saturday. As I turned slowly and carefully onto my street, I could see my dad\u0027s police cruiser in the driveway of our home. He\u0027d skipped fishing again today. Still sulking about the So I wouldn\u0027t be able to use the phone inside. But I had to call___ I parked on the curb behind the Chevy sculpture and pulled the cell phone Edward had given me for emergencies out of the glove compartment. I dialed, keeping my finger on the \"end\" button as the phone rang. Just in case. \"Hello?\" Seth Clearwater answered, and I sighed in relief. I was way too chicken to speak to his older sister, Leah. The phrase \"bite my head off was not entirely a figure of speech when it came to Leah. \"Hey, Seth, it\u0027s Bella.\" \"Oh, hiya, Bella! How are you?\" Choked up. Desperate for reassurance. \"Fine.\" \"Calling for an update?\" \"You\u0027re psychic.\" \"Not hardly. I\u0027m no Alice - you\u0027re just predictable,\" he joked. Among the Quileute pack down at La Push, only Seth was comfortable even mentioning the Cullens by name, let alone joking about things like my nearly omniscient sister-in-law-to-be. \"I know I am.\" I hesitated for a minute. \"How is he?\" Seth sighed. \"Same as ever. He won\u0027t talk, though we know he hears us. He\u0027s trying not to think human, you know. Just going with his instincts.\" \"Do you know where he is now?\" \"Somewhere in northern Canada. I can\u0027t tell you which province. He doesn\u0027t pay much attention to state lines.\" \"Any hint that he might...\" \"He\u0027s not coming home, Bella. Sorry.\" I swallowed. \"S\u0027okay, Seth. I knew before I asked. I just can\u0027t help wishing.\" \"Yeah. We all feel the same way.\" \"Thanks for putting up with me, Seth. I know the others must give you a hard time.\" \"They\u0027re not your hugest fans,\" he agreed cheerfully. \"Kind of lame, I think. Jacob made his choices, you made yours. Jake doesn\u0027t like their attitude about it. \u0027Course, he isn\u0027t super thrilled that you\u0027re checking up on him, either.\" I gasped. \"I thought he wasn\u0027t talking to you?\" \"He can\u0027t hide everything from us, hard as he\u0027s trying.\" So Jacob knew I was worried. I wasn\u0027t sure how I felt about that. Well, at least he knew I hadn\u0027t skipped off into the sunset and forgotten him completely. He might have imagined me capable of that. \"I guess I\u0027ll see you at the... wedding,\" I said, forcing the word out through my teeth. \"Yeah, me and my mom will be there. It was cool of you to ask us.\" I smiled at the enthusiasm in his voice. Though inviting the Clearwaters had been Edward\u0027s idea, I was glad he\u0027d thought of it. Having Seth there would be nice - a link, however tenuous, to my missing best man. \"It wouldn\u0027t be the same without you.\" \"Tell Edward I said hi, \u0027kay?\" \"Sure thing.\" I shook my head. The friendship that had sprung up between Edward and Seth was something that still boggled my mind. It was proof, though, that things didn\u0027t have to be this way. That vampires and werewolves could get along just fine, thank you very much, if they were of a mind to. Not everybody liked this idea. \"Ah,\" Seth said, his voice cracking up an octave. \"Er, Leah\u0027s home.\" \"Oh! Bye!\" The phone went dead. I left it on the seat and prepared myself mentally to go inside the house, where Charlie would be waiting. My poor dad had so much to deal with right now. Jacob-the-runaway was just one of the straws on his overburdened back. He was almost as worried about me, his barely-a-legal-adult daughter who was about to become a Mrs. in just a few days\u0027 time. I walked slowly through the light rain, remembering the night we\u0027d told him___ As the sound of Charlie\u0027s cruiser announced his return, the ring suddenly weighed a hundred pounds on my finger. I wanted to shove my left hand in a pocket, or maybe sit on it, but Edward\u0027s cool, firm grasp kept it front and center. \"Stop fidgeting, Bella. Please try to remember that you\u0027re not confessing to a murder here.\" \"Easy for you to say.\" I listened to the ominous sound of my father\u0027s boots clomping up the sidewalk. The key rattled in the already open door. The sound reminded me of that part of the horror movie when the victim realizes she\u0027s forgotten to lock herdeadbolt. \"Calm down, Bella,\" Edward whispered, listening to the acceleration of my heart. The door slammed against the wall, and I flinched like I\u0027d been Tasered. \"Hey, Charlie,\" Edward called, entirely relaxed. \"No!\" I protested under my breath. \"What?\" Edward whispered back. \"Wait till he hangs his gun up!\" Edward chuckled and ran his free hand through his tousled bronze hair. Charlie came around the corner, still in his uniform, still armed, and tried not to make a face when he spied us sitting together on the loveseat. Lately, he\u0027d been putting forth a lot of effort to like Edward more. Of course, this revelation was sure to end that effort immediately. \"Hey, kids. What\u0027s up?\" \"We\u0027d like to talk to you,\" Edward said, so serene. \"We have some good news.\" Charlie\u0027s expression went from strained friendliness to black suspicion in a second. \"Good news?\" Charlie growled, looking straight at me. \"Have a seat, Dad.\" He raised one eyebrow, stared at me for five seconds, then stomped to the recliner and sat down on the very edge, his back ramrod straight. \"Don\u0027t get worked up, Dad,\" I said after a moment of loaded silence. \"Everything\u0027s okay.\" Edward grimaced, and I knew it was in objection to the word okay. He probably would have used something more like wonderful or perfect or glorious. \"Sure it is, Bella, sure it is. If everything is so great, then why are you sweating bullets?\" \"I\u0027m not sweating,\" I lied. I leaned away from his fierce scowl, cringing into Edward, and instinctively wiped the back of my right hand across my forehead to remove the evidence. \"You\u0027re pregnant!\" Charlie exploded. \"You\u0027re pregnant, aren\u0027t you?\" Though the question was clearly meant for me, he was glaring at Edward now, and I could have sworn I saw his hand twitch toward the gun. \"No! Of course I\u0027m not!\" I wanted to elbow Edward in the ribs, but I knew that move would only give me a bruise. I\u0027d told Edward that people would immediately jump to this conclusion! What other possible reason would sane people have for getting married at eighteen? (His answer then had made me roll my eyes. Love. Right.) Charlie\u0027s glower lightened a shade. It was usually pretty clear on my face when I was telling the truth, and he believed me now. \"Oh. Sorry.\" \"Apology accepted.\" There was a long pause. After a moment, I realized everyone was waiting for me to say something. I looked up at Edward, panic-stricken. There was no way I was going to get the words out. He smiled at me and then squared his shoulders and turned to my father. \"Charlie, I realize that I\u0027ve gone about this out of order. Traditionally, I should have asked you first. I mean no disrespect, but since Bella has already said yes and I don\u0027t want to diminish her choice in the matter, instead of asking you for her hand, I\u0027m asking you for your blessing. We\u0027re getting married, Charlie. I love her more than anything in the world, more than my own life, and - by some miracle - she loves me that way, too. Will you give us your blessing?\" He sounded so sure, so calm. For just an instant, listening to the absolute confidence in his voice, I experienced a rare moment of insight, i could see, fleetingly, the way the world looked to him. For the length of one heartbeat, this news made perfect sense. And then I caught sight of the expression on Charlie\u0027s face, his eyes now locked on the ring. I held my breath while his skin changed colors - fair to red, red to purple, purple to blue. I started to get up - I\u0027m not sure what I planned to do; maybe use the Heimlich maneuver to make sure he wasn\u0027t choking - but Edward squeezed my hand and murmured \"Give him a minute\" so low that only I could hear. The silence was much longer this time. Then, gradually, shade by shade, Charlie\u0027s color returned to normal. His lips pursed, and his eyebrows furrowed; I recognized his \"deep in thought\" expression. He studied the two of us for a long moment, and I felt Edward relax at my side. \"Guess I\u0027m not that surprised,\" Charlie grumbled. \"Knew I\u0027d have to deal with something like this soon enough.\" I exhaled. \"You sure about this?\" Charlie demanded, glaring at me. \"I\u0027m one hundred percent sure about Edward,\" I told him without missing a beat. \"Getting married, though? What\u0027s the rush?\" He eyed me suspiciously again. The rush was due to the fact that I was getting closer to nineteen every stinking day, while Edward stayed frozen in all his seventeen-year-old perfection, as he had for over ninety years. Not that this fact necessitated marriage in my book, but the wedding was required due to the delicate and tangled compromise Edward and I had made to finally get to this point, the brink of my transformation from mortal to immortal. These weren\u0027t things I could explain to Charlie. \"We\u0027re going away to Dartmouth together in the fall, Charlie,\" Edward reminded him. \"I\u0027d like to do that, well, the right way. It\u0027s how I was raised.\" He shrugged. He wasn\u0027t exaggerating; they\u0027d been big on old-fashioned morals during World War I. Charlie\u0027s mouth twisted to the side. Looking for an angle to argue from. But what could he say? I\u0027d prefer you live in sin first? He was a dad; his hands were tied. \"Knew this was coming,\" he muttered to himself, frowning. Then, suddenly, his face went perfectly smooth and blank. \"Dad?\" I asked anxiously. I glanced at Edward, but I couldn\u0027t read his face, either, as he watched Charlie. \"Ha!\" Charlie exploded. I jumped in my seat. \"Ha, ha, ha!\" I stared incredulously as Charlie doubled over in laughter; his whole body shook with it. I looked at Edward for a translation, but Edward had his lips pressed tightly together, like he was trying to hold back laughter himself. \"Okay, fine,\" Charlie choked out. \"Get married.\" Another roll of laughter shook through him. \"But...\" \"But what?\" I demanded. \"But you have to tell your mom! I\u0027m not saying one word to Renee! That\u0027s all yours!\" He busted into loud guffaws. I paused with my hand on the doorknob, smiling. Sure, at the time, Charlie\u0027s words had terrified me. The ultimate doom: telling Renee. Early marriage was higher up on her blacklist than boiling live puppies. Who could have foreseen her response? Not me. Certainly not Charlie. Maybe Alice, but I hadn\u0027t thought to ask her. \"Well, Bella,\" Renee had said after I\u0027d choked and stuttered out the impossible words: /Worn, I\u0027m marrying Edward. Tm a little miffed that you waited so long to tell me. Plane tickets only get more expensive. Oooh,\" she\u0027d fretted. \"Do you think Phil\u0027s cast will be off by then? It will spoil the pictures if he\u0027s not in a tux - \" \"Back up a second, Mom.\" I\u0027d gasped. \"What do you mean, waited so long? I just got en-en . . .\" - I\u0027d been unable to force out the word engaged - \"things settled, you know, today.\" \"Today? Really? That is a surprise. I assumed ...\" \"What did you assume? When did you assume?\" \"Well, when you came to visit me in April, it looked like things were pretty much sewn up, if you know what I mean. You\u0027re not very hard to read, sweetie. But I didn\u0027t say anything because I knew it wouldn\u0027t do any good. You\u0027re exactly like Charlie.\" She\u0027d sighed, resigned. \"Once you make up your mind, there is no reasoning with you. Of course, exactly like Charlie, you stick by your decisions, too.\" And then she\u0027d said the last thing that I\u0027d ever expected to hear from my mother. \"You\u0027re not making my mistakes, Bella. You sound like you\u0027re scared silly, and I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s because you\u0027re afraid of me.\" She\u0027d giggled. \"Of what I\u0027m going to think. And I know I\u0027ve said a lot of things about marriage and stupidity - and I\u0027m not taking them back - but you need to realize that those things specifically applied to me. You\u0027re a completely different person than I am. You make your own kinds of mistakes, and I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll have your share of regrets in life. But commitment was never your problem, sweetie. You have a better chance of making this work than most forty-year-olds I know.\" Renee had laughed again. \"My little middle-aged child. Luckily, you seem to have found another old soul.\" \"You\u0027re not... mad? You don\u0027t think I\u0027m making a humongous mistake?\" \"Well, sure, I wish you\u0027d wait a few more years. I mean, do I look old enough to be a mother-in-law to you? Don\u0027t answer that. But this isn\u0027t about me. This is about you. Are you happy?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m having an out-of-body experience right now.\" Renee had chuckled. \"Does he make you happy, Bella?\" \"Yes, but - \" \"Are you ever going to want anyone else?\" \"No, but - \" \"But what?\" \"But aren\u0027t you going to say that I sound exactly like every other infatuated teenager since the dawn of time?\" \"You\u0027ve never been a teenager, sweetie. You know what\u0027s best for you.\" For the last few weeks, Renee had unexpectedly immersed herself in wedding plans. She\u0027d spent hours every day on the phone with Edward\u0027s mother, Esme - no worries about the in-laws getting along. Renee adored Esme, but then, I doubted anyone could help responding that way to my lovable almost-mother-in-law. It let me right off the hook. Edward\u0027s family and my family were taking care of the nuptials together without my having to do or know or think too hard about any of it. Charlie was furious, of course, but the sweet part was that he wasn\u0027t furious at me. Renee was the traitor. He\u0027d counted on her to play the heavy. What could he do now, when his ultimate threat - telling Mom - had turned out to be utterly empty? He had nothing, and he knew it. So he moped around the house, muttering things about not being able to trust anyone in this world___ \"Dad?\" I called as I pushed open the front door. \"I\u0027m home.\" \"Hold on, Bells, stay right there.\" \"Huh?\" I asked, pausing automatically. \"Gimme a second. Ouch, you got me, Alice.\" Alice? \"Sorry, Charlie,\" Alice\u0027s trilling voice responded. \"How\u0027s that?\" \"I\u0027m bleeding on it.\" \"You\u0027re fine. Didn\u0027t break the skin - trust me.\" \"What\u0027s going on?\" I demanded, hesitating in the doorway. \"Thirty seconds, please, Bella,\" Alice told me. \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" \"Humph,\" Charlie added. I tapped my foot, counting each beat. Before I got to thirty, Alice said, \"Okay, Bella, come in!\" Moving with caution, I rounded the little corner into our living room. \"Oh,\" I huffed. \"Aw. Dad. Don\u0027t you look - \" \"Silly?\" Charlie interrupted. \"I was thinking more like debonair\" Charlie blushed. Alice took his elbow and tugged him around into a slow spin to showcase the pale gray tux. \"Now cut that out, Alice. I look like an idiot.\" \"No one dressed by me ever looks like an idiot.\" \"She\u0027s right, Dad. You look fabulous! What\u0027s the occasion?\" Alice rolled her eyes. \"It\u0027s the final check on the fit. For both of you.\" I peeled my gaze off the unusually elegant Charlie for the first time and saw the dreaded white garment bag laid carefully across the sofa. \"Aaah.\" \"Go to your happy place, Bella. It won\u0027t take long.\" I sucked in a deep breath and closed my eyes. Keeping them shut, I stumbled my way up the stairs to my room. I stripped down to my underwear and held my arms straight out. \"You\u0027d think I was shoving bamboo splinters under your nails,\" Alice muttered to herself as she followed me in. I paid no attention to her. I was in my happy place. In my happy place, the whole wedding mess was over and done. Behind me. Already repressed and forgotten. We were alone, just Edward and me. The setting was fuzzy and constantly in flux - it morphed from misty forest to cloud-covered city to arctic night - because Edward was keeping the location of our honeymoon a secret to surprise me. But I wasn\u0027t especially concerned about the where part. Edward and I were together, and I\u0027d fulfilled my side of our compromise perfectly. I\u0027d married him. That was the big one. But I\u0027d also accepted all his outrageous gifts and was registered, however futilely, to attend Dartmouth College in the fall. Now it was his turn. Before he turned me into a vampire - his big compromise - he had one other stipulation to make good on. Edward had an obsessive sort of concern over the human things that I would be giving up, the experiences he didn\u0027t want me to miss. Most of them - like the prom, for example - seemed silly to me. There was only one human experience I worried about missing. Of course it would be the one he wished I would forget completely. Here was the thing, though. I knew a little about what I was going to be like when I wasn\u0027t human anymore. I\u0027d seen newborn vampires firsthand, and I\u0027d heard all my family-to-be\u0027s stories about those wild early days. For several years, my biggest personality trait was going to be thirsty, it would take some time before I could be me again. And even when I was in control of myself, I would never feel exactly the way I felt now. Human... and passionately in love. I wanted the complete experience before I traded in my warm, breakable, pheromone-riddled body for something beautiful, strong... and unknown. I wanted a real honeymoon with Edward. And, despite the danger he feared this would put me in, he\u0027d agreed to try. I was only vaguely aware of Alice and the slip and slide of satin over my skin. I didn\u0027t care, for the moment, that the whole town was talking about me. I didn\u0027t think about the spectacle I would have to star in much too soon. I didn\u0027t worry about tripping on my train or giggling at the wrong moment or being too young or the staring audience or even the empty seat where my best friend should be. I was with Edward in my happy place.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-4-breaking-dawn-twilight-4/page-2.html","bookId":2026,"book":{"id":2026,"title":"The Twilight Saga 4: Breaking Dawn (Twilight #4)","description":"Storyline: Breaking Dawn is the fourth novel in the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer.
