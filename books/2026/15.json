{"id":108085,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"14. You Know Things Are Bad When You Feel Guilty For Being Rude To Vampires VAMPIRES When I got back to the house, there was no one waiting outside for my report. Still on alert? Everything\u0027s cool,I thought tiredly. My eyes quickly caught a small change in the now-familiar scene. There was a stack of light-colored fabric on the bottom step of the porch. I loped over to investigate. Holding my breath, because the vampire smell stuck to the fabric like you wouldn\u0027t believe, I nudged the stack with my nose. Someone had laid out clothes. Huh. Edward must have caught my moment of irritation as I\u0027d bolted out the door. Well. That was... nice. And weird. I took the clothes gingerly between my teeth - ugh - and carried them back to the trees. Just in case this was some joke by the blond psychopath and I had a bunch of girls\u0027 stuff here. Bet she\u0027d love to see the look on my human face as I stood there naked, holding a sundress. In the cover of the trees, I dropped the stinking pile and shifted back to human. I shook the clothes out, snapping them against a tree to beat some of the smell from them. They were definitely guy\u0027s clothes - tan pants and a white button-down shirt. Neither of them long enough, but they looked like they\u0027d fit around me. Must be Emmett\u0027s. I rolled the cuffs up on the shirtsleeves, but there wasn\u0027t much I could do about the pants. Oh well. I had to admit, I felt better with some clothes to my name, even stinky ones that didn\u0027t quite fit. It was hard not being able to just jet back home and grab another pair of old sweatpants when I needed them. The homeless thing again - not having anyplace to go back to. No possessions, either, which wasn\u0027t bothering me too bad now, but would probably get annoying soon. Exhausted, I walked slowly up the Cullens\u0027 porch steps in my fancy new secondhand clothes but hesitated when I got to the door. Did I knock? Stupid, when they knew I was here. I wondered why no one acknowledged that - told me either to come in or get lost Whatever. I shrugged and let myself in. More changes. The room had shifted back to normal - almost - in the last twenty minutes. The big flat-screen was on, low volume, showing some chick flick that no one seemed to be watching. Carlisle and Esme stood by the back windows, which were open to the river again. Alice, Jasper, and Emmett were out of sight, but I heard them murmuring upstairs. Bella was on the couch like yesterday, with just one tube still hooked into her, and an IV hanging behind the back of the sofa. She was wrapped up like a burrito in a couple of thick quilts, so at least they\u0027d listened to me before. Rosalie was cross-legged on the ground by her head. Edward sat at the other end of the couch with Bella\u0027s burrito\u0027ed feet in his lap. He looked up when I came in and smiled at me - just a little twitch of his mouth - like something pleased him. Bella didn\u0027t hear me. She only glanced up when he did, and then she smiled, too. With real energy, her whole face lighting up. I couldn\u0027t remember the last time she\u0027d looked so excited to see me. What was with her? For crying out loud, she was married] Happily married, too - there was no question that she was in love with her vampire past the boundaries of sanity. And hugely pregnant, to top it off. So why did she have to be so damn thrilled to see me? Like I\u0027d made her whole freakin\u0027 day by walking through the door. If she would just not care... Or more than that - really not want me around. It would be so much easier to stay away. Edward seemed to be in agreement with my thoughts - we were on the same wavelength so much lately it was crazy. He was frowning now, reading her face while she beamed at me. \"They just wanted to talk,\" I mumbled, my voice dragging with exhaustion. \"No attack on the horizon.\" \"Yes,\" Edward answered. \"I heard most of it.\" That woke me up a little. We\u0027d been a good three miles out. \"How?\" Tm hearing you more clearly - it\u0027s a matter of familiarity and concentration. Also, your thoughts are slightly easier to pick up when you\u0027re in your human form. So I caught most of what passed out there.\" \"Oh.\" It bugged me a little, but for no good reason, so I shrugged it off. \"Good. I hate repeating myself.\" \"I\u0027d tell you to go get some sleep,\" Bella said, \"but my guess is that you\u0027re going to pass out on the floor in about six seconds, so there\u0027s probably no point.\" It was amazing how much better she sounded, how much stronger she looked. I smelled fresh blood and saw that the cup was in her hands again. How much blood would it take to keep her going? At some point, would they start trotting in the neighbors? I headed for the door, counting off the seconds for her as I walked. \"One Mississippi... two Mississippi...\" \"Where\u0027s the flood, mutt?\" Rosalie muttered. \"You know how you drown a blonde, Rosalie?\" I asked without stopping or turning to look at her. \"Glue a mirror to the bottom of a pool.\" I heard Edward chuckle as I pulled the door shut. His mood seemed to improve in exact correlation to Bella\u0027s health. \"I\u0027ve already heard that one,\u00277Rosalie called after me. I trudged down the steps, my only goal to drag myself far enough into the trees that the air would be pure again. I planned to ditch the clothes a convenient distance from the house for future use rather than tying them to my leg, so I wouldn\u0027t be smelling them, either. As I fumbled with the buttons on the new shirt, I thought randomly about how buttons would never be in style for werewolves. I heard the voices while I slogged across the lawn. \"Where are you going?\" Bella asked. \"There was something I forgot to say to him.\" \"Let Jacob sleep - it can wait.\" Yes, please, let Jacob sleep. \"It will only take a moment.\" I turned slowly. Edward was already out the door. He had an apology in his expression as he approached me. \"Jeez, what now?\" Tm sorry,\" he said, and then he hesitated, like he didn\u0027t know how to phrase what he was thinking. What\u0027s on your mind, mind reader? \"When you were speaking to Sam\u0027s delegates earlier,\" he murmured, \"I was giving a play-by-play for Carlisle and Esme and the rest. They were concerned - \" \"Look, we\u0027re not dropping our guard. You don\u0027t have to believe Sam like we do. We\u0027re keeping our eyes open regardless.\" \"No, no, Jacob. Not about that. We trust your judgment. Rather, Esme was troubled by the hardships this is putting your pack through. She asked me to speak to you privately about it.\" That took me off guard. \"Hardships?\" \"The homeless part, particularly. She\u0027s very upset that you are all so... bereft.\" I snorted. Vampire mother hen - bizarre. \"We\u0027re tough. Tell her not to worry.\" \"She\u0027d still like to do what she can. I got the impression that Leah prefers not to eat in her wolf form?\" \"And?\" I demanded. \"Well, we do have normal human food here, Jacob. Keeping up appearances, and, of course, for Bella. Leah is welcome to anything she\u0027d like. All of you are.\" \"I\u0027ll pass that along.\" \"Leah hates us.\" \"So?\" \"So try to pass it along in such a way as to make her consider it, if you don\u0027t mind.\" \"I\u0027ll do what I can.\" \"And then there\u0027s the matter of clothes.\" I glanced down at the ones I was wearing. \"Oh yeah. Thanks.\" It probably wouldn\u0027t be good manners to mention how bad they reeked. He smiled, just a little. \"Well, we\u0027re easily able to help out with any needs there. Alice rarely allows us to wear the same thing twice. We\u0027ve got piles of brand-new clothes that are destined for Goodwill, and I\u0027d imagine that Leah is fairly close to Esme\u0027s size___\" \"Not sure how she\u0027ll feel about bloodsucker castoffs. She\u0027s not as practical as I am.\" \"I trust that you can present the offer in the best possible light. As well as the offer for any other physical object you might need, or transportation, or anything else at all. And showers, too, since you prefer to sleep outdoors. Please... don\u0027t consider yourselves without the benefits of a home.\" He said the last line softly - not trying to keep quiet this time, but with some kind of real emotion. I stared at him for a second, blinking sleepily. \"That\u0027s, er, nice of you. Tell Esme we appreciate the, uh, thought. But the perimeter cuts through the river in a few places, so we stay pretty clean, thanks.\" \"If you would pass the offer on, regardless.\" \"Sure, sure.\" \"Thank you.\" I turned away from him, only to stop cold when I heard the low, pained cry from inside the house. By the time I looked back, he was already gone. What now? I followed after him, shuffling like a zombie. Using about the same number of brain cells, too. It didn\u0027t feel like I had a choice. Something was wrong. I would go see what it was. There would be nothing I could do. And I would feel worse. It seemed inevitable. I let myself in again. Bella was panting, curled over the bulge in the center of her body. Rosalie held her while Edward, Carlisle, and Esme all hovered. A flicker of motion caught my eye; Alice was at the top of the stairs, staring down into the room with her hands pressed to her temples. It was weird - like she was barred from entering somehow. \"Give me a second, Carlisle,\" Bella panted. \"Bella,\" the doctor said anxiously, \"I heard something crack. I need to take a look.\" \"Pretty sure\" - pant - \"it was a rib. Ow. Yep. Right here.\" She pointed to her left side, careful not to touch. It was breaking her bones now. \"I need to take an X-ray. There might be splinters. We don\u0027t want it to puncture anything.\" Bella took a deep breath. \"Okay.\" Rosalie lifted Bella carefully. Edward seemed like he was going to argue, but Rosalie bared her teeth at him and growled, \"I\u0027ve already got her.\" So Bella was stronger now, but the thing was, too. You couldn\u0027t starve one without starving the other, and healing worked just the same. No way to win. Blondie carried Bella swiftly up the big staircase with Carlisle and Edward right on her heels, none of them taking any notice of me standing dumbstruck in the doorway. So they had a blood bank and an X-ray machine? Guess the doc brought his work home with him. I was too tired to follow them, too tired to move. I leaned back against the wall and then slid to the ground. The door was still open, and I pointed my nose toward it, grateful for the clean breeze blowing in. I leaned my head against the jamb and listened. I could hear the sound of the X-ray machinery upstairs. Or maybe I just assumed that\u0027s what it was. And then the lightest of footsteps coming down the stairs. I didn\u0027t look to see which vampire it was. \"Do you want a pillow?\" Alice asked me. \"No,\" I mumbled. What was with the pushy hospitality? It was creeping me out. \"That doesn\u0027t look comfortable,\" she observed. \"S\u0027not.\" \"Why don\u0027t you move, then?\" \"Tired. Why aren\u0027t you upstairs with the rest of them?\" I shot back. \"Headache,\" she answered. I rolled my head around to look at her. Alice was a tiny little thing. \u0027Bout the size of one of my arms. She looked even smaller now, sort of hunched in on herself. Her small face was pinched. \"Vampires get headaches?\" \"Not the normal ones.\" I snorted. Normal vampires. \"So how come you\u0027re never with Bella anymore?\" I asked, making the question an accusation. It hadn\u0027t occurred to me before, because my head had been full of other crap, but it was weird that Alice was never around Bella, not since I\u0027d been here. Maybe if Alice were by her side, Rosalie wouldn\u0027t be. \"Thought you two were like this.\" I twisted two of my fingers together. \"Like I said\" - she curled up on the tile a few feet from me, wrapping her skinny arms around her skinny knees - \"headache.\" \"Bella\u0027s giving you a headache?\" \"Yes.\" I frowned. Pretty sure I was too tired for riddles. I let my head roll back around toward the fresh air and closed my eyes. \"Not Bella, really,\" she amended. \"The... fetus.\" Ah, someone else who felt like I did. It was pretty easy to recognize. She said the word grudgingly, the way Edward did. \"I can\u0027t see it,\" she told me, though she might have been talking to herself. For all she knew, I was already gone. \"I can\u0027t see anything about it. Just like you.\" I flinched, and then my teeth ground together. I didn\u0027t like being compared to the creature. \"Bella gets in the way. She\u0027s all wrapped around it, so she\u0027s... blurry. Like bad reception on a TV - like trying to focus your eyes on those fuzzy people jerking around on the screen. It\u0027s killing my head to watch her. And I can\u0027t see more than a few minutes ahead, anyway. The... fetus is too much a part of her future. When she first decided... when she knew she wanted it, she blurred right out of my sight. Scared me to death.\" She was quiet for a second, and then she added, \"I have to admit, it\u0027s a relief having you close by - in spite of the wet-dog smell. Everything goes away. Like having my eyes closed. It numbs the headache.\" \"Happy to be of service, ma\u0027am,\" I mumbled. \"I wonder what it has in common with you... why you\u0027re the same that way.\" Sudden heat flashed in the center of my bones. I clenched my fists to hold off the tremors. \"I have nothing in common with that life-sucker,\" I said through my teeth. \"Well, there\u0027s something there.\" I didn\u0027t answer. The heat was already burning away. I was too dead tired to stay furious. \"You don\u0027t mind if I sit here by you, do you?\" she asked. \"Guess not. Stinks anyway.\" \"Thanks,\" she said. \"This is the best thing for it, I guess, since I can\u0027t take aspirin.\" \"Could you keep it down? Sleeping, here.\" She didn\u0027t respond, immediately lapsing into silence. I was out in seconds. I was dreaming that I was really thirsty. And there was a big glass of water in front of me - all cold, you could see the condensation running down the sides. I grabbed the cup and took a huge gulp, only to find out pretty quick that it wasn\u0027t water - it was straight bleach. I choked it back out, spewing it everywhere, and a bunch of it blew out of my nose. It burned. My nose was on fire.... The pain in my nose woke me up enough to remember where I\u0027d fallen asleep. The smell was pretty fierce, considering that my nose wasn\u0027t actually inside the house. Ugh. And it was noisy. Someone was laughing too loud. A familiar laugh, but one that didn\u0027t go with the smell. Didn\u0027t belong. I groaned and opened my eyes. The skies were dull gray - it was daytime, but no clue as to when. Maybe close to sunset - it was pretty dark. \"About time,\" Blondie mumbled from not too far away. \"The chainsaw impersonation was getting a little tired.\" I rolled over and wrenched myself into a sitting position. In the process, I figured out where the smell was coming from. Someone had stuffed a wide feather pillow under my face. Probably trying to be nice, I\u0027d guess. Unless it\u0027d been Rosalie. Once my face was out of the stinking feathers, I caught other scents. Like bacon and cinnamon, all mixed up with the vampire smell. I blinked, taking in the room. Things hadn\u0027t changed too much, except that now Bella was sitting up in the middle of the sofa, and the IV was gone. Blondie sat at her feet, her head resting against Bella\u0027s knees. Still gave me chills to see how casually they touched her, though I guess that was pretty brain-dead, all things considered. Edward was on one side of her, holding her hand. Alice was on the floor, too, like Rosalie. Her face wasn\u0027t pinched up now. And it was easy to see why - she\u0027d found another painkiller. \"Hey, Jake\u0027s coming around!\" Seth crowed. He was sitting on Bella\u0027s other side, his arm slung carelessly over her shoulders, an overflowing plate of food on his lap. What the hell? \"He came to find you,\" Edward said while I got to my feet. \"And Esme convinced him to stay for breakfast.\" Seth took in my expression, and he hurried to explain. \"Yeah, Jake - I was just checking to see if you were okay \u0027cause you didn\u0027t ever phase back. Leah got worried. I told her you probably just crashed human, but you know how she is. Anyway, they had all this food and, dang,\" - he turned to Edward - \"man, you can cook\" \"Thank you,\" Edward murmured. I inhaled slowly, trying to unclench my teeth. I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off Seth\u0027s arm. \"Bella got cold,\" Edward said quietly. Right. None of my business, anyway. She didn\u0027t belong to me. Seth heard Edward\u0027s comment, looked at my face, and suddenly he needed both hands to eat with. He took his arm off Bella and dug in. i walked over to stand a few feet from the couch, still trying to get my bearings. \"Leah running patrol?\" I asked Seth. My voice was still thick with sleep. \"Yeah,\" he said as he chewed. Seth had new clothes on, too. They fit him better than mine fit me. \"She\u0027s on it. No worries. She\u0027ll howl if there\u0027s anything. We traded off around midnight. I ran twelve hours.\" He was proud of that, and it showed in his tone. \"Midnight? Wait a minute - what time is it now?\" \"\u0027Bout dawn.\" He glanced toward the window, checking. Well, damn. I\u0027d slept through the rest of the day and the whole night - dropped the ball. \"Crap. Sorry about that, Seth. Really. You shoulda kicked me awake.\" \"Naw, man, you needed some serious sleep. You haven\u0027t taken a break since when? Night before your last patrol for Sam? Like forty hours? Fifty? You\u0027re not a machine, Jake. \u0027Sides, you didn\u0027t miss anything at all.\" Nothing at all? I glanced quickly at Bella. Her color was back to the way I remembered it. Pale, but with the rose undertone. Her lips were pink again. Even her hair looked better - shinier. She saw me appraising and gave me a qrin. \"How\u0027s the rib?\" I asked. \"Taped up nice and tight, i don\u0027t even feel it.\u00277 I rolled my eyes. I heard Edward grind his teeth together, and I figured her blow-it-off attitude bugged him as much at it bugged me. \"What\u0027s for breakfast?\" I asked, a little sarcastic. \"O negative or AB positive?\" She stuck her tongue out at me. Totally herself again. \"Omelets,\" she said, but her eyes darted down, and I saw that her cup of blood was wedged between her leg and Edward\u0027s. \"Go get some breakfast, Jake,\" Seth said. \"There\u0027s a bunch in the kitchen. You\u0027ve got to be empty.\" I examined the food in his lap. Looked like half a cheese omelet and the last fourth of a Frisbee-sized cinnamon roll. My stomach growled, but I ignored it. \"What\u0027s Leah having for breakfast?\" I asked Seth critically. \"Hey, I took food to her before I ate anything\" he defended himself. \"She said she\u0027d rather eat roadkill, but I bet she caves. These cinnamon rolls... \" He seemed at a loss for words. \u0027Til go hunt with her, then.\" Seth sighed as I turned to leave. \"A moment, Jacob?\" It was Carlisle asking, so when I turned around again, my face was probably less disrespectful than it would have been if anyone else had stopped me. \"Yeah?\" Carlisle approached me while Esme drifted off toward the other room. He stopped a few feet away, just a little bit farther away than the normal space between two humans having a conversation. I appreciated him giving me my space. \"Speaking of hunting,\" he began in a somber tone. \"That\u0027s going to be an issue for my family. I understand that our previous truce is inoperative at the moment, so I wanted your advice. Will Sam be hunting for us outside of the perimeter you\u0027ve created? We don\u0027t want to take a chance with hurting any of your family - or losing any of ours. If you were in our shoes, how would you proceed?\" I leaned away, a little surprised, when he threw it back at me like that. What would I know about being in a bloodsucker\u0027s expensive shoes? But, then again, I did know Sam. \"It\u0027s a risk,\" I said, trying to ignore the other eyes I felt on me and to talk only to him. \"Sam\u0027s calmed down some, but I\u0027m pretty sure that in his head, the treaty is void. As long as he thinks the tribe, or any other human, is in real danger, he\u0027s not going to ask questions first, if you know what I mean. But, with all that, his priority is going to be La Push. There really aren\u0027t enough of them to keep a decent watch on the people while putting out hunting parties big enough to do much damage. I\u0027d bet he\u0027s keeping it close to home.\" Carlisle nodded thoughtfully. \"So I guess I\u0027d say, go out together, just in case. And probably you should go in the day, \u0027cause we\u0027d be expecting night. Traditional vampire stuff. You\u0027re fast - go over the mountains and hunt far enough away that there\u0027s no chance he\u0027d send anyone that far from home.\" \"And leave Bella behind, unprotected?\" I snorted. \"What are we, chopped liver?\" Carlisle laughed, and then his face was serious again. \"Jacob, you can\u0027t fight against your brothers.\" My eyes tightened. \"I\u0027m not saying it wouldn\u0027t be hard, but if they were really coming to kill her - I would be able to stop them.\" Carlisle shook his head, anxious. \"No, I didn\u0027t mean that you would be... incapable. But that it would be very wrong. I can\u0027t have that on my conscience.\" \"It wouldn\u0027t be on yours, Doc. It would be on mine. And I can take it.\" \"No, Jacob. We will make sure that our actions don\u0027t make that a necessity.\" He frowned thoughtfully \"We\u0027ll go three at a time,\" he decided after a second. \"That\u0027s probably the best we can do.\" \"I don\u0027t know, Doc. Dividing down the middle isn\u0027t the best strategy.\" \"We\u0027ve got some extra abilities that will even it up. If Edward is one of the three, he\u0027ll be able to give us a few miles\u0027 radius of safety.\" We both glanced at Edward. His expression had Carlisle backtracking quickly. \"I\u0027m sure there are other ways, too,\" Carlisle said. Clearly, there was no physical need strong enough to get Edward away from Bella now. \"Alice, I would imagine you could see which routes would be a mistake?\" \"The ones that disappear,\" Alice said, nodding. \"Easy.\" Edward, who had gone all tense with Carlisle\u0027s first plan, loosened up. Bella was staring unhappily at Alice, that little crease between her eyes that she got when she was stressed out. \"Okay, then,\" I said. \"That\u0027s settled. I\u0027ll just be on my way. Seth, I\u0027ll expect you back on at dusk, so get a nap in there somewhere, all right?\" \"Sure, Jake. I\u0027ll phase back soon as I\u0027m done. Unless ...\" he hesitated, looking at Bella. \"Do you need me?\" \"She\u0027s got blankets,\" I snapped at him. \"I\u0027m fine, Seth, thanks,\" Bella said quickly. And then Esme flitted back in the room, a big covered dish in her hands. She stopped hesitantly just behind Carlisle\u0027s elbow, her wide, dark gold eyes on my face. She held the dish out and took a shy step closer. \"Jacob,\" she said quietly. Her voice wasn\u0027t quite so piercing as the others\u0027. \"I know it\u0027s... unappetizing to you, the idea of eating here, where it smells so unpleasant. But I would feel much better if you would take some food with you when you go. I know you can\u0027t go home, and that\u0027s because of us. Please - ease some of my remorse. Take something to eat.\" She held the food out to me, her face all soft and pleading. I don\u0027t know how she did it, because she didn\u0027t look older than her mid-twenties, and she was bone pale, too, but something about her expression suddenly reminded me of my mom. Jeez. \"Uh, sure, sure,\" I mumbled. \"I guess. Maybe Leah\u0027s still hungry or something.\" I reached out and took the food with one hand, holding it away, at arm\u0027s length. I\u0027d go dump it under a tree or something. I didn\u0027t want her to feel bad. Then I remembered Edward. Don\u0027t you say anything to her! Let her think I ate it. I didn\u0027t look at him to see if he was in agreement. He\u0027d better be in agreement. Bloodsucker owed me. \"Thank you, Jacob,\" Esme said, smiling at me. How did a stone face have dimples, for crying out loud? \"Urn, thank you,\" I said. My face felt hot - hotter than usual. This was the problem with hanging out with vampires - you got used to them. They started messing up the way you saw the world. They started feeling like friends. \"Will you come back later, Jake?\" Bella asked as I tried to make a run for it. \"Uh, I don\u0027t know.\" She pressed her lips together, like she was trying not to smile. \"Please? I might get cold.\" I inhaled deeply through my nose, and then realized, too late, that that was not a good idea. I winced. \"Maybe.\" \"Jacob?\" Esme asked. I backed toward the door as she continued; she took a few steps after me. \"I left a basket of clothes on the porch. They\u0027re for Leah. They\u0027re freshly washed - I tried to touch them as little as possible.\" She frowned. \"Do you mind taking them to her?\" \"On it,\" I muttered, and then I ducked out the door before anyone could guilt me into anything else.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-4-breaking-dawn-twilight-4/page-15.html","bookId":2026,"book":{"id":2026,"title":"The Twilight Saga 4: Breaking Dawn (Twilight #4)","description":"Storyline: Breaking Dawn is the fourth novel in the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer.
