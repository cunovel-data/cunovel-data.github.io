TAKE MINE. TAKE EVERYTHING I HAVE.\n I sort of had a plan as I ran to the Cullens\u0027 garage. The second part of it was totaling the bloodsucker\u0027s car on my way back.\n So I was at a loss when I mashed the button on the keyless remote, and it was not his Volvo that beeped and flashed its lights for me. It was another car - a standout even in the long line of vehicles that were mostly all drool-worthy in their own ways.\n Did he actually mean to give me the keys to an Aston Martin Vanquish, or was that an accident?\n I didn\u0027t pause to think about it, or if this would change that second part of my plan. I just threw myself into the silky leather seat and cranked the engine while my knees were still crunched up under the steering wheel. The sound of the motor\u0027s purr might have made me moan another day, but right now it was all I could do to concentrate enough to put it in drive.\n I found the seat release and shoved myself back as my foot rammed the pedal down. The car felt almost airborne as it leaped forward.\n It only took seconds to race through the tight, winding drive. The car responded to me like my thoughts were steering rather than my hands. As I blew out of the green tunnel and onto the highway, I caught a fleeting glimpse of Leah\u0027s gray face peering uneasily through the ferns.\n For half a second, I wondered what she\u0027d think, and then I realized that I didn\u0027t care.\n I turned south, because I had no patience today for ferries or traffic or anything else that meant I might have to lift my foot off the pedal.\n In a sick way, it was my lucky day. If by lucky you meant taking a well-traveled highway at two hundred without so much as seeing one cop, even in the thirty-mile-an-hour speed-trap towns. What a letdown. A little chase action\n might have been nice, not to mention that the license plate info would bring the heat down on the leech. Sure, he\u0027d buy his way out of it, but it might have been just a little inconvenient for him.\n The only sign of surveillance i came across was just a hint of dark brown fur flitting through the woods, running parallel to me for a few miles on the south side of Forks. Quil, it looked like. He must have seen me, too, because he disappeared after a minute without raising an alarm. Again, I almost wondered what his story would be before I remembered that I didn\u0027t care.\n I raced around the long U-shaped highway, heading for the biggest city I could find. That was the first part of my plan.\n It seemed to take forever, probably because I was still on the razor blades, but it actually didn\u0027t even take two hours before I was driving north into the undefined sprawl that was part Tacoma and part Seattle. I slowed down then, because I really wasn\u0027t trying to kill any innocent bystanders.\n This was a stupid plan. It wasn\u0027t going to work. But, as I\u0027d searched my head for any way at all to get away from the pain, what Leah\u0027d said today had popped in there.\n That would go away, you know, if you imprinted. You wouldn\u0027t have to hurt over her anymore.\n Seemed like maybe getting your choices taken away from you wasn\u0027t the very worst thing in the world. Maybe feeling like this was the very worst thing in the world.\n But I\u0027d seen all the girls in La Push and up on the Makah rez and in Forks. I needed a wider hunting range.\n So how do you look for a random soul mate in a crowd? Well, first, I needed a crowd. So I tooled around, looking for a likely spot. I passed a couple of malls, which probably would\u0027ve been pretty good places to find girls my age, but I couldn\u0027t make myself stop. Did I want to imprint on some girl who hung out in a mall all day?\n I kept going north, and it got more and more crowded. Eventually, I found a big park full of kids and families and skateboards and bikes and kites and picnics and the whole bit. I hadn\u0027t noticed till now - it was a nice day. Sun and all that. People were out celebrating the blue sky.\n I parked across two handicapped spots - just begging for a ticket - and joined the crowd.\n I walked around for what felt like hours. Long enough that the sun changed sides in the sky. I stared into the face of every girl who passed anywhere near me, making myself really look, noticing who was pretty and who had blue eyes and who looked good in braces and who had way too much makeup on. I tried to find something interesting about each face, so that I would know for sure that I\u0027d really tried. Things like: This one had a really straight nose; that one should pull her hair out of her eyes; this one could do lipstick ads if the rest of her face was as perfect as her mouth___\n Sometimes they stared back. Sometimes they looked scared - like they were thinking, Who is this big freak glaring at me? Sometimes I thought they looked kind of interested, but maybe that was just my ego running wild.\n Either way, nothing. Even when I met the eyes of the girl who was - no contest - the hottest girl in the park and probably in the city, and she stared right back with a speculation that looked like interest, I felt nothing. Just the same desperate drive to find a way out of the pain.\n As time went on, I started noticing all the wrong things. Bella things. This one\u0027s hair was the same color. That one\u0027s eyes were sort of shaped the same. This one\u0027s cheekbones cut across her face in just the same way. That one had the same little crease between her eyes - which made me wonder what she was worrying about___\n That was when I gave up. Because it was beyond stupid to think that I had picked exactly the right place and time and I was going to simply walk into my soul mate just because I was so desperate to.\n It wouldn\u0027t make sense to find her here, anyway. If Sam was right, the best place to find my genetic match would be in La Push. And, clearly, no one there fit the bill. If Billy was right, then who knew? What made for a stronger wolf?\n I wandered back to the car and then slumped against the hood and played with the keys.\n Maybe I was what Leah thought she was. Some kind of dead end that shouldn\u0027t be passed on to another generation. Or maybe it was just that my life was a big, cruel joke, and there was no escape from the punch line.\n \"Hey, you okay? Hello? You there, with the stolen car.\"\n It took me a second to realize that the voice was talking to me, and then another second to decide to raise my head.\n A familiar-looking girl was staring at me, her expression kind of anxious. I knew why I recognized her face - I\u0027d already catalogued this one. Light red-gold hair, fair skin, a few gold-colored freckles sprinkled across her cheeks and nose, and eyes the color of cinnamon.\n \"If you\u0027re feeling that remorseful over boosting the car,\" she said, smiling so that a dimple popped out in her chin, \"you could always turn yourself in.\"\n \"It\u0027s borrowed, not stolen,\" I snapped. My voice sounded horrible - like I\u0027d been crying or something. Embarrassing.\n \"Sure, thatW hold up in court.\"\n I glowered. \"You need something?\"\n \"Not really. I was kidding about the car, you know. It\u0027s just that... you look really upset about something. Oh, hey, I\u0027m Lizzie.\" She held out her hand.\n I looked at it until she let it fall.\n \"Anyway...,\" she said awkwardly, \"I was just wondering if I could help. Seemed like you were looking for someone before.\" She gestured toward the park and shrugged.\n \"Yeah.\"\n She waited.\n I sighed. \"I don\u0027t need any help. She\u0027s not here.\"\n \"Oh. Sorry.\"\n \"Me, too,\" I muttered.\n I looked at the girl again. Lizzie. She was pretty. Nice enough to try to help a grouchy stranger who must seem nuts. Why couldn\u0027t she be the one? Why did everything have to be so freaking complicated? Nice girl, pretty, and sort of funny. Why not?\n \"This is a beautiful car,\" she said. \"It\u0027s really a shame they\u0027re not making them anymore. I mean, the Vantage\u0027s body styling is gorgeous, too, but there\u0027s just something about the Vanquish___\"\n Nice girl who knew cars. Wow. I stared at her face harder, wishing I knew how to make it work. C\u0027mon, Jake - imprint already.\n \"How\u0027s it drive?\" she asked.\n \"Like you wouldn\u0027t believe,\" I told her.\n She grinned her one-dimple smile, clearly pleased to have dragged a halfway civil response out of me, and I gave her a reluctant smile back.\n But her smile did nothing about the sharp, cutting blades that raked up and down my body. No matter how much I wanted it to, my life was not going to come together like that.\n I wasn\u0027t in that healthier place where Leah was headed. I wasn\u0027t going to be able to fall in love like a normal person. Not when I was bleeding over someone else. Maybe - if it was ten years from now and Bella\u0027s heart was long dead and I\u0027d hauled myself through the whole grieving process and come out in one piece again - maybe then I could offer Lizzie a ride in a fast car and talk makes and models and get to know something about her and see if I liked her as a person. But that wasn\u0027t going to happen now.\n Magic wasn\u0027t going to save me. I was just going to have to take the torture like a man. Suck it up.\n Lizzie waited, maybe hoping I was going to offer her that ride. Or maybe not.\n \"I\u0027d better get this car back to the guy I borrowed it from,\" I muttered.\n She smiled again. \"Glad to hear you\u0027re going straight.\"\n \"Yeah, you convinced me.\"\n She watched me get in the car, still sort of concerned. I probably looked like someone who was about to drive off a cliff. Which maybe I would\u0027ve, if that kind of move\u0027d work for a werewolf. She waved once, her eyes trailing after the car.\n At first, I drove more sanely on the way back. I wasn\u0027t in a rush. I didn\u0027t want to go where I was going. Back to that house, back to that forest. Back to the pain I\u0027d run from. Back to being absolutely alone with it.\n Okay, that was melodramatic. I wouldn\u0027t be all alone, but that was a bad thing. Leah and Seth would have to suffer with me. I was glad Seth wouldn\u0027t have to suffer long. Kid didn\u0027t deserve to have his peace of mind ruined. Leah didn\u0027t, either, but at least it was something she understood. Nothing new about pain for Leah.\n I sighed big as I thought about what Leah wanted from me, because I knew now that she was going to get it. I was still pissed at her, but I couldn\u0027t ignore the fact that i could make her life easier. And - now that I knew her better - I thought she would probably do this for me, if our positions were reversed.\n It would be interesting, at the very least, and strange, too, to have Leah as a companion - as a friend. We were going to get under each other\u0027s skin a lot, that was for sure. She wouldn\u0027t be one to let me wallow, but I thought that was a good thing. I\u0027d probably need someone to kick my butt now and then. But when it came right down to it, she was really the only friend who had any chance of understanding what I was going through now.\n I thought of the hunt this morning, and how close our minds had been for that one moment in time. It hadn\u0027t been a bad thing. Different. A little scary, a little awkward. But also nice in a weird way.\n I didn\u0027t have to be all alone.\n And I knew Leah was strong enough to face with me the months that were coming. Months and years. It made me tired to think about it. I felt like I was staring out across an ocean that I was going to have to swim from shore to shore before I could rest again.\n So much time coming, and then so little time before it started. Before I was flung into that ocean. Three and a half more days, and here I was, wasting that little bit of time I had.\n I started driving too fast again.\n I saw Sam and Jared, one on either side of the road like sentinels, as I raced up the road toward Forks. They were well hidden in the thick branches, but I was expecting them, and I knew what to look for. I nodded as I blew past them, not bothering to wonder what they made of my day trip.\n I nodded to Leah and Seth, too, as I cruised up the Cullens\u0027 driveway. It was starting to get dark, and the clouds were thick on this side of the sound, but I saw their eyes glitter in the glow of the headlights. I would explain to them later. There\u0027d be plenty of time for that.\n It was a surprise to find Edward waiting for me in the garage. I hadn\u0027t seen him away from Bella in days. I could tell from his face that nothing bad had happened to her. In fact, he looked more peaceful than before. My stomach tightened as I remembered where that peace came from.\n It was too bad that - with all my brooding - I\u0027d forgotten to wreck the car. Oh well. I probably wouldn\u0027t have been able to stand hurting this car, anyway. Maybe he\u0027d guessed as much, and that\u0027s why he\u0027d lent it to me in the first place.\n \"A few things, Jacob,\" he said as soon as I cut the engine.\n I took a deep breath and held it for a minute. Then, slowly, I got out of the car and threw the keys to him.\n \"Thanks for the loan,\" I said sourly. Apparently, it would have to be repaid. \"What do you want now?\"\n \"Firstly... I know how averse you are to using your authority with your pack, but...\"\n I blinked, astonished that he would even dream of starting in on this one. \"What?\"\n \"If you can\u0027t or won\u0027t control Leah, then I - \"\n \"Leah?\" I interrupted, speaking through my teeth. \"What happened?\"\n Edward\u0027s face was hard. \"She came up to see why you\u0027d left so abruptly. I tried to explain. I suppose it might not have come out right.\"\n \"What did she do?\"\n \"She phased to her human form and - \"\n \"Really?\" I interrupted again, shocked this time. I couldn\u0027t process that. Leah letting her guard down right in the mouth of the enemy\u0027s lair?\n \"She wanted to... speak to Bella.\"\n \"To Bella?\"\n Edward got all hissy then. \"I won\u0027t let Bella be upset like that again. I don\u0027t care how justified Leah thinks she is! I didn\u0027t hurt her - of course I wouldn\u0027t - but I\u0027ll throw her out of the house if it happens again. I\u0027ll launch her right across the river - \"\n \"Hold on. What did she say?\" None of this was making any sense.\n Edward took a deep breath, composing himself. \"Leah was unnecessarily harsh. I\u0027m not going to pretend that I understand why Bella is unable to let go of you, but I do know that she does not behave this way to hurt you. She suffers a great deal over the pain she\u0027s inflicting on you, and on me, by asking you to stay. What Leah said was uncalled for. Bella\u0027s been crying - \"\n \"Wait - Leah was yelling at Bella about me?\"\n He nodded one sharp nod. \"You were quite vehemently championed.\"\n Whoa. \"I didn\u0027t ask her to do that.\"\n \"I know.\"\n I rolled my eyes. Of course he knew. He knew everything.\n But that was really something about Leah. Who would have believed it? Leah walking into the bloodsuckers\u0027 place human to complain about how /was being treated.\n \"I can\u0027t promise to control Leah,\" I told him. \"I won\u0027t do that. But I\u0027ll talk to her, okay? And I don\u0027t think there\u0027ll be a repeat. Leah\u0027s not one to hold back, so she probably got it all off her chest today.\"\n \"I would say so.\"\n \"Anyway, I\u0027ll talk to Bella about it, too. She doesn\u0027t need to feel bad. This one\u0027s on me.\"\n \"I already told her that.\"\n \"Of course you did. Is she okay?\"\n \"She\u0027s sleeping now. Rose is with her.\"\n So the psycho was \"Rose\" now. He\u0027d completely crossed over to the dark side.\n He ignored that thought, continuing with a more complete answer to my question. \"She\u0027s... better in some ways. Aside from Leah\u0027s tirade and the resulting guilt.\"\n Better. Because Edward was hearing the monster and everything was all lovey-dovey now. Fantastic.\n \"It\u0027s a bit more than that,\" he murmured. \"Now that I can make out the child\u0027s thoughts, it\u0027s apparent that he or she has remarkably developed mental facilities. He can understand us, to an extent.\"\n My mouth fell open. \"Are you serious?\"\n \"Yes. He seems to have a vague sense of what hurts her now. He\u0027s trying to avoid that, as much as possible. He... loves her. Already.\"\n I stared at Edward, feeling sort of like my eyes might pop out of their sockets. Underneath that disbelief, I could see right away that this was the critical factor. This was what had changed Edward - that the monster had convinced him of this love. He couldn\u0027t hate what loved Bella. It was probably why he couldn\u0027t hate me, either. There was a big\n difference, though. I wasn\u0027t killing her.\n Edward went on, acting like he hadn\u0027t heard all that. \"The progress, I believe, is more than we\u0027d judged. When Carlisle returns - \"\n \"They\u0027re not back?\" I cut in sharply. I thought of Sam and Jared, watching the road. Would they get curious as to what was going on?\n \"Alice and Jasper are. Carlisle sent all the blood he was able to acquire, but it wasn\u0027t as much as he was hoping for - Bella will use up this supply in another day the way her appetite has grown. Carlisle stayed to try another source. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessary now, but he wants to be covered for any eventuality.\"\n \"Why isn\u0027t it necessary? If she needs more?\"\n I could tell he was watching and listening to my reaction carefully as he explained. Tm trying to persuade Carlisle to deliver the baby as soon as he is back.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"The child seems to be attempting to avoid rough movements, but it\u0027s difficult. He\u0027s become too big. It\u0027s madness to wait, when he\u0027s clearly developed beyond what Carlisle had guessed. Bella\u0027s too fragile to delay.\"\n I kept getting my legs knocked out from under me. First, counting on Edward\u0027s hatred of the thing so much. Now, I\u0027d realized that I thought of those four days as a sure thing. I\u0027d banked on them.\n The endless ocean of grief that waited stretched out before me.\n I tried to catch my breath.\n Edward waited. I stared at his face while I recovered, recognizing another change there.\n \"You think she\u0027s going to make it,\" I whispered.\n \"Yes. That was the other thing I wanted to talk to you about.\"\n I couldn\u0027t say anything. After a minute, he went on.\n \"Yes,\" he said again. \"Waiting, as we have been, for the child to be ready, that was insanely dangerous. At any moment it could have been too late. But if we\u0027re proactive about this, if we act quickly, I see no reason why it should not go well. Knowing the child\u0027s mind is unbelievably helpful. Thankfully, Bella and Rose agree with me. Now that I\u0027ve convinced them it\u0027s safe for the child if we proceed, there\u0027s nothing to keep this from working.\"\n \"When will Carlisle be back?\" I asked, still whispering. I hadn\u0027t got my breath back yet.\n \"By noon tomorrow.\"\n My knees buckled. I had to grab the car to hold myself up. Edward reached out like he was offering support, but then he thought better of it and dropped his hands.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he whispered. \"I am truly sorry for the pain this causes you, Jacob. Though you hate me, I must admit that I don\u0027t feel the same about you. I think of you as a... a brother in many ways. A comrade\n in arms, at the very least. I regret your suffering more than you realize. But Bella is going to survive\" - when he said that his voice was fierce, even violent - \"and I know that\u0027s what really matters to you.\"\n He was probably right. It was hard to tell. My head was spinning.\n \"So I hate to do this now, while you\u0027re already dealing with too much, but, clearly, there is little time. I have to ask you for something - to beg, if I must.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have anything left,\" I choked out.\n He lifted his hand again, as if to put it on my shoulder, but then let it drop like before and sighed.\n \"I know how much you have given,\" he said quietly. \"But this is something you do have, and only you. I\u0027m asking this of the true Alpha, Jacob. I\u0027m asking this of Ephraim\u0027s heir.\"\n I was way past being able to respond.\n \"I want your permission to deviate from what we agreed to in our treaty with Ephraim. I want you to grant us an exception. I want your permission to save her life. You know 111 do it anyway, but I don\u0027t want to break faith with you if there is any way to avoid it. We never intended to go back on our word, and we don\u0027t do it lightly now. I want your understanding, Jacob, because you know exactly why we do this. I want the alliance between our families to survive when this is over.\"\n I tried to swallow. Sam, I thought. It\u0027s Sam you want.\n \"No. Sam\u0027s authority is assumed. It belongs to you. You\u0027ll never take it from him, but no one can rightfully agree to what I\u0027m asking except for you\"\n It\u0027s not my decision.\n \"It is, Jacob, and you know it. Your word on this will condemn us or absolve us. Only you can give this to me.\"\n can\u0027t think. I don\u0027t know.\n \"We don\u0027t have much time.\" He glanced back toward the house.\n No, there was no time. My few days had become a few hours.\n don\u0027t know. Let me think. Just give me a minute here, okay?\n \"Yes.\"\n I started walking to the house, and he followed. Crazy how easy it was, walking through the dark with a vampire right beside me. It didn\u0027t feel unsafe, or even uncomfortable, really. It felt like walking next to anybody. Well, anybody who smelled bad.\n There was a movement in the brush at the edge of the big lawn, and then a low whimper. Seth shrugged through the ferns and loped over to us.\n \"Hey, kid,\" I muttered.\n He dipped his head, and I patted his shoulder.\n \"S\u0027all cool,\" I lied. \"I\u0027ll tell you about it later. Sorry to take off on you like that.\"\n He grinned at me.\n \"Hey, tell your sister to back off now, okay? Enough.\"\n Seth nodded once.\n I shoved against his shoulder this time. \"Get back to work. I\u0027ll spell you in a bit.\"\n Seth leaned against me, shoving back, and then he galloped into the trees.\n \"He has one of the purest, sincerest, kindest minds I\u0027ve ever heard,\" Edward murmured when he was outof sight. \"You\u0027re lucky to have his thoughts to share.\"\n \"I know that,\"! grunted.\n We started toward the house, and both of our heads snapped up when we heard the sound of someone sucking through a straw. Edward was in a hurry then.He darted up the porch stairs and was gone.\n \"Bella, love, Ithought you were sleeping,\" I heard him say. \"I\u0027m sorry, I wouldn\u0027t have left.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry. Ijust got so thirsty - it woke me up.It\u0027s a good thing Carlisle is bringing more. This kid is going to need it when he gets out of me.\"\n \"True. That\u0027s a good point.\"\n \"I wonder if he\u0027ll want anything else,\" she mused.\n \"I suppose we\u0027ll find out.\"\n I walked through the door.\n Alice said, \"Finally,\" and Bella\u0027s eyes flashed to me. That infuriating, irresistible smile broke across her face for one second. Then it faltered, and her face fell. Her lips puckered, like she was trying not to cry.\n I wanted to punch Leah right in her stupid mouth.\n \"Hey, Bells,\" Isaid quickly. \"How ya doing?\"\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" she said.\n \"Big day today, huh? Lots of new stuff.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have to do that, Jacob.\"\n \"Don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" I said, going to sit on the arm of the sofa by her head. Edward had the floor there already.\n She gave me a reproachful look. \"I\u0027m so s - \" she started to say.\n I pinched her lips together between my thumb and finger.\n \"Jake,\" she mumbled, trying to pull my hand away. Her attempt was so weak it was hard to believe that she was really trying.\n I shook my head. \"You can talk when you\u0027re not being stupid.\"\n \"Fine,I won\u0027t say it,\" it sounded like she mumbled.\n I pulled my hand away.\n \"Sorry!\" she finished quickly, and then grinned.\n I rolledmy eyes and then smiled back at her.\n When I stared into her eyes, I saw everything that I\u0027d been looking for in the park.\n Tomorrow, she\u0027d be someone else. But hopefully alive, and that was what counted, right? She\u0027d look at me with the same eyes, sort of. Smile with the same lips, almost. She\u0027d still know me better than anyone who didn\u0027t havefull access to the inside of my head.\n Leah might be an interesting companion, maybe even a true friend - someone who would stand up for me. But\n she wasn\u0027t my best friend the way thatBella was. Aside from the impossible love I felt for Bella, there was also that other bond, and it ran bone deep.\n Tomorrow, she\u0027d be my enemy. Or she\u0027d be myally. And, apparently, that distinction was up to me.\n I sighed.\n Fine!I thought, giving up the very last thing i had to give. It made me feel hollow. Go ahead. Save her. As Ephraim\u0027s heir, you have my permission, my word, that this will not violate the treaty. The others will just have to blame me. You were right - they can\u0027t deny that it\u0027s my right to agree to this.\n \u0027Thank you.\" Edward\u0027s whisper was low enough that Bella didn\u0027t hear anything. But the words were so fervent that, from the corner of my eye, I saw the other vampires turning to stare.\n \"So,\"Bella asked, working to be casual. \"How was your day?\"\n \"Great. Went for a drive. Hung out in the park.\"\n \"Sounds nice.\"\n \"Sure, sure.\"\n Suddenly, she made a face. \"Rose?\" she asked.\n I heard Blondie chuckle. \"Again?\"\n \"I think I\u0027ve drunk two gallons in the last hour,\" Bella explained.\n Edward and I both got out of the way while Rosalie came to lift Bella from the couch and take her to the bathroom.\n \"Can I walk?\" Bella asked. \"My legs are so stiff.\"\n \"Are you sure?\" Edward asked.\n \"Rose\u0027llcatch me if I trip over my feet. Which could happen pretty easily, since I can\u0027t see them.\"\n Rosalie set Bellacarefully on her feet, keeping her hands right atBella\u0027s shoulders. Bella stretched her arms out in front of her, wincing a little.\n \"That feels good,\" she sighed. \"Ugh, but I\u0027m huge.\"\n She really was. Her stomach was its own continent.\n \"One more day,\" she said, and patted her stomach.\n I couldn\u0027t help the pain that shot through me in a sudden, stabbing burst, but I tried to keep it off my face. I could hide it for one more day, right?\n \"All righty, then. Whoops - oh, no!\"\n The cup Bella had left on the sofa tumbled to one side, the dark red blood spilling out onto the pale fabric.\n Automatically, though three other hands beat her there, Bella bent over, reaching out to catch it.\n There was the strangest, muffled ripping sound from the center of her body.\n \"Oh!\" she gasped.\n And then she went totally limp, slumping toward the floor. Rosalie caught her in the same instant, before she could fall. Edward was there, too, hands out, the mess on the sofa forgotten.\n \"Bella?\" he asked, and then his eyes unfocused, and panic shot across his features.\n A half second later,Bella screamed.\n Itwas not justa scream, it was a blood-curdling shriek of agony.
