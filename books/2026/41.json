{"id":108110,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\"So it was a combination of things there at the end, but what it really boiled down to was... Bella,\" Edward was explaining. Our family and our two remaining guests sat in the Cullens\u0027 great room while the forest turned black outside the tall windows. Vladimir and Stefan had vanished before we\u0027d stopped celebrating. They were extremely disappointed in the way things had turned out, but Edward said that they\u0027d enjoyed the Volturi\u0027s cowardice almost enough to make up for their frustration. Benjamin and Tia were quick to follow after Amun and Kebi, anxious to let them know the outcome of the conflict; I was sure we would see them again - Benjamin and Tia, at least. None of the nomads lingered. Peter and Charlotte had a short conversation with Jasper, and then they were gone, too. The reunited Amazons had been anxious to return home as well - they had a difficult time being away from their beloved rain forest - though they were more reluctant to leave than some of the others. \"You must bring the child to see me,\" Zafrina had insisted. \"Promise me, young one.\" Nessie had pressed her hand to my neck, pleading as well. \"Of course, Zafrina,\" I\u0027d agreed. \"We shall be great friends, my Nessie,\" the wild woman had declared before leaving with her sisters. The Irish coven continued the exodus. \"Well done, Siobhan,\" Carlisle complimented her as they said goodbye. \"Ah, the power of wishful thinking,\" she answered sarcastically, rolling her eyes. And then she was serious. \"Of course, this isn\u0027t over. The Volturi won\u0027t forgive what happened here.\" Edward was the one to answer that. \"They\u0027ve been seriously shaken; their confidence is shattered. But, yes, I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll recover from the blow someday. And then . . .\" His eyes tightened. \"I imagine they\u0027ll try to pick us off separately.\" \"Alice will warn us when they intend to strike,\" Siobhan said in a sure voice. \"And we\u0027ll gather again. Perhaps the time will come when our world is ready to be free of the Volturi altogether.\" \"That time may come,\" Carlisle replied. \"If it does, we\u0027ll stand together.\" \"Yes, my friend, we will,\" Siobhan agreed. \"And how can we fail, when /will it otherwise?\" She let out a great peal of laughter. \"Exactly,\" Carlisle said. He and Siobhan embraced, and then he shook Liam\u0027s hand. \"Try to find Alistair and tell him what happened. I\u0027d hate to think of him hiding under a rock for the next decade.\" Siobhan laughed again. Maggie hugged both Nessie and me, and then the Irish coven was gone. The Denalis were the last to leave, Garrett with them - as he would be from now on, I was fairly sure. The atmosphere of celebration was too much for Tanya and Kate. They needed time to grieve for their lost sister. Huilen and Nahuel were the ones who stayed, though I had expected those last two to go back with the Amazons. Carlisle was deep in fascinated conversation with Huilen; Nahuel sat close beside her, listening while Edward told the rest of us the story of the conflict as only he knew it. \"Alice gave Aro the excuse he needed to get out of the fight. If he hadn\u0027t been so terrified of Bella, he probably would have gone ahead with their original plan.\" \"Terrified?\" I said skeptically. \"Of me?\" He smiled at me with a look I didn\u0027t entirely recognize - it was tender, but also awed and even exasperated. \"When will you ever see yourself clearly?\" he said softly. Then he spoke louder, to the others as well as to me. \"The Volturi haven\u0027t fought a fair fight in about twenty-five hundred years. And they\u0027ve never, never fought one where they were at a disadvantage. Especially since they gained Jane and Alec, they\u0027ve only been involved with unopposed slaughterings. \"You should have seen how we looked to them! Usually, Alec cuts off all sense and feeling from their victims while they go through the charade of a counsel. That way, no one can run when the verdict is given. But there we stood, ready, waiting, outnumbering them, with gifts of our own while their gifts were rendered useless by Bella. Aro knew that with Zafrina on our side, they would be the blind ones when the battle commenced. I\u0027m sure our numbers would have been pretty severely decimated, but they were sure that theirs would be, too. There was even a good possibility that they would lose. They\u0027ve never dealt with that possibility before. They didn\u0027t deal with it well today.\" \"Hard to feel confident when you\u0027re surrounded by horse-sized wolves,\" Emmett laughed, poking Jacob\u0027s arm. Jacob flashed a grin at him. \"It was the wolves that stopped them in the first place,\" I said. \"Sure was,\" Jacob agreed. \"Absolutely,\" Edward agreed. \"That was another sight they\u0027ve never seen. The true Children of the Moon rarely move in packs, and they are never much in control of themselves. Sixteen enormous regimented wolves was a surprise they weren\u0027t prepared for. Caius is actually terrified of werewolves. He almost lost a fight with one a few thousand years ago and never got over it.\" \"So there are real werewolves?\" I asked. \"With the full moon and silver bullets and all that?\" Jacob snorted. \"Real. Does that make me imaginary?\" \"You know what I mean.\" \"Full moon, yes,\" Edward said. \"Silver bullets, no - that was just another one of those myths to make humans feel like they had a sporting chance. There aren\u0027t very many of them left. Caius has had them hunted into near extinction.\" \"And you never mentioned this because... ?\" \"It never came up.\" I rolled my eyes, and Alice laughed, leaning forward - she was tucked under Edward\u0027s other arm - to wink at me. I glared back. I loved her insanely, of course. But now that I\u0027d had a chance to realize that she was really home, that her defection was only a ruse because Edward had to believe that she\u0027d abandoned us, I was beginning to feel pretty irritated with her. Alice had some explaining to do. Alice sighed. \"Just get it off your chest, Bella.\" \"How could you do that to me, Alice?\" \"It was necessary.\" \"Necessary!\" I exploded. \"You had me totally convinced that we were all going to die! I\u0027ve been a wreck for weeks.\" \"It might have gone that way,\" she said calmly. \"In which case you needed to be prepared to save Nessie.\" Instinctively, I held Nessie - asleep now on my lap - tighter in my arms. \"But you knew there were other ways, too,\" I accused. \"You knew there was hope. Did it ever occur to you that you could have told me everything? I know Edward had to think we were at a dead end for Aro\u0027s sake, but you could have told me.\" She looked at me speculatively for a moment. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" she said. \"You\u0027re just not that good an actress.\" \"This was about my acting skills?\" \"Oh, take it down an octave, Bella. Do you have any idea how complicated Ms was to set up? I couldn\u0027t even be sure that someone like Nahuel existed - all I knew was that I would be looking for something I couldn\u0027t see! Try to imagine searching for a blind spot - not the easiest thing I\u0027ve ever done. Plus we had to send back the key witnesses, like we weren\u0027t in enough of a hurry. And then keeping my eyes open all the time in case you decided to throw me any more instructions. At some point you\u0027re going to have to tell me what exactly is in Rio. Before any of that, I had to try to see every trick the Volturi might come in with and give you what few clues I could so you would be ready for their strategy, and I only had just a few hours to trace out all the possibilities. Most of all, I had to make sure you\u0027d all believe that I was ditching out on you, because Aro had to be positive that you had nothing left up your sleeves or he never would have committed to an out the way he did. And if you think I didn\u0027t feel like a schmuck - \" \"Okay, okay!\" I interrupted. \"Sorry! I know it was rough for you, too. It\u0027s just that... well, I missed you like crazy, Alice. Don\u0027t do that to me again.\" Alice\u0027s trilling laugh rang through the room, and we all smiled to hear that music once more. \"I missed you, too, Bella. So forgive me, and try to be satisfied with being the superhero of the day.\" Everyone else laughed now, and I ducked my face into Nessie\u0027s hair, embarrassed. Edward went back to analyzing every shift of intention and control that had happened in the meadow today, declaring that it was my shield that had made the Volturi run away with their tails between their legs. The way everyone looked at me made me uncomfortable. Even Edward. It was like I had grown a hundred feet during the course of the morning. I tried to ignore the impressed looks, mostly keeping my eyes on Nessie\u0027s sleeping face and Jacob\u0027s unchanged expression. I would always be just Bella to him, and that was a relief. The hardest stare to ignore was also the most confusing one. It wasn\u0027t like this half-human, half-vampire Nahuel was used to thinking of me in a certain way. For all he knew, I went around routing attacking vampires every day and the scene in the meadow had been nothing unusual at all. But the boy never took his eyes off me. Or maybe he was looking at Nessie. That made me uncomfortable, too. He couldn\u0027t be oblivious to the fact that Nessie was the only female of his kind that wasn\u0027t his half-sister. I didn\u0027t think this idea had occurred to Jacob yet. I kind of hoped it wouldn\u0027t soon. I\u0027d had enough fighting to last me for a while. Eventually, the others ran out of questions for Edward, and the discussion dissolved into a bunch of smaller conversations. I felt oddly tired. Not sleepy, of course, but just like the day had been long enough. I wanted some peace, some normality. I wanted Nessie in her own bed; I wanted the walls of my own little home around me. I looked at Edward and felt for a moment like I could read his mind. I could see he felt exactly the same way. Ready for some peace. \"Should we take Nessie ...\" \u0027That\u0027s probably a good idea,\" he agreed quickly. \"I\u0027m sure she didn\u0027t sleep soundly last night, what with all the snoring.\" He grinned at Jacob. Jacob rolled his eyes and then yawned. \"It\u0027s been a while since I slept in a bed. I bet my dad would get a kick out of having me under his roof again.\" I touched his cheek. \"Thank you, Jacob.\" \"Anytime, Bella. But you already know that.\" He got up, stretched, kissed the top of Nessie\u0027s head, and then the top of mine. Finally, he punched Edward\u0027s shoulder. \"See you guys tomorrow. I guess things are going to be kind of boring now, aren\u0027t they?\" \"I fervently hope so,\" Edward said. We got up when he was gone; I shifted my weight carefully so that Nessie was never jostled. I was deeply grateful to see her getting a sound sleep. So much weight had been on her tiny shoulders. It was time she got to be a child again - protected and secure. A few more years of childhood. The idea of peace and security reminded me of someone who didn\u0027t have those feelings all the time. \"Oh, Jasper?\" I asked as we turned for the door. Jasper was sandwiched tight in between Alice and Esme, somehow seeming more central to the family picture than usual. \"Yes, Bella?\" Tm curious - why is J. Jenks scared stiff by just the sound of your name?\" Jasper chuckled.\"It\u0027s just been my experience that some kinds of working relationships are better motivated by fear than by monetary gain.\" I frowned, promising myself that I would take over that working relationship from now on and spare J the heart attack that was surely on the way. We were kissed and hugged and wished a good night to our family. The only off note was Nahuel again, who looked intently after us, as if he wished he could follow. Once we were across the river, we walked barely faster than human speed, in no hurry, holding hands. I was sick of being under a deadline, and I just wanted to take my time. Edward must have felt the same. \"I have to say, I\u0027m thoroughly impressed with Jacob right now,\" Edward told me. \"Thewolves make quite an impact, don\u0027t they?\" \"That\u0027s not what I mean. Not once today did he think about the fact that, according to Nahuel,Nessie will befully matured in just six and a half years.\" I considered that for a minute. \"He doesn\u0027t see her that way. He\u0027s not in a hurry for her to grow up.He just wants her to be happy.\" \"I know. Like I said, impressive. It goes against the grain to say so, but she could do worse.\" I frowned. \"I\u0027m not going to think about that for approximately six and a half more years.\" Edward laughed and then sighed. \"Of course, itlooks like he\u0027ll have some competition to worry about when the time comes.\" My frown deepened. \"I noticed. I\u0027m grateful to Nahuel for today, but all the staring was a little weird. I don\u0027t care if she is the only half-vampire he\u0027s not related to.\" \"Oh, he wasn\u0027t staring at her - he was staring at you.\" That\u0027s what it had seemed like... but that didn\u0027t make any sense. \"Why would he do that?\" \"Because you\u0027re alive,\" he said quietly. \"You lost me.\" \"All his life,\" he explained,\" - and he\u0027s fifty years older than I am - \" \"Decrepit,\" I interjected. Heignored me. \"He\u0027s always thought of himself as an evil creation, a murderer by nature. His sistersall killed their mothers as well, but they thought nothing of it. Joham raised them to think of the humans as animals, while they were gods. But Nahuel was taught by Huilen, and Huilen loved her sister more than anyone else. It shaped his whole perspective. And, in some ways, he truly hated himself.\" \"That\u0027sso sad,\"I murmured. \"And then he saw the three of us - and realized for the first time that just because he ishalf immortal, it doesn\u0027t mean he is inherently evil. He looks at me and sees... what his father should have been.\" \"You are fairly ideal in every way,\" I agreed. He snorted and then was serious again. \"He looks at you and sees the life his mother should have had.\" \"Poor Nahuel,\" Imurmured, and then sighed because I knew I would never be able to think badly of him after this, no matter how uncomfortable his stare made me. \"Don\u0027t be sad for him. He\u0027s happy now. Today, he\u0027s finally begun to forgive himself.\" I smiled for Nahuel\u0027s happiness and then thought that today belonged to happiness. Though Irina\u0027s sacrifice wasa dark shadow against the white light, keeping the moment from perfection, the joy was impossible to deny. The life I\u0027d fought for was safe again. My family was reunited. My daughter had a beautiful future stretching out endlessly in front of her. Tomorrow I would go see my father; he would see that the fear in my eyes had been replaced with joy, and he would be happy, too. Suddenly, I was sure that I wouldn\u0027t find him there alone. I hadn\u0027t been as observant as I might have been in the last few weeks, but in this moment it was like I\u0027d known all along. Sue would be with Charlie - thewerewolves\u0027 mom with the vampire\u0027s dad - and he wouldn\u0027t be alone anymore. I smiled widely at this new insight. But most significant in this tidal wave of happiness was the surest fact ofall: I was with Edward. Forever. Not that I\u0027d want to repeat the last several weeks, but I had to admit they\u0027d made me appreciate what I had more than ever. The cottage was a place of perfect peace in the silver-blue night. We carried Nessie to her bed and gently tucked her in. She smiled as she slept. I took Aro\u0027s gift from around my neck and tossed it lightly into the corner of her room. She could play with it if she wished; she liked sparkly things. Edward and I walked slowly to our room, swinging our arms between us. \"A night for celebrations,\" he murmured, and he put his hand under my chin to lift my lips to his. \"Wait,\" I hesitated, pulling away. He looked at me in confusion. As a general rule, I didn\u0027t pull away. Okay, it was more than a general rule. This was a first. \"I want to try something,\" I informed him, smiling slightly at his bewildered expression. I put my hands on both sides of his face and closed my eyes in concentration. I hadn\u0027t done very well with this when Zafrina had tried to teach me before, but I knew my shield better now. I understood the part that fought against separation from me, the automatic instinct to preserve self aboveall else. Itstill wasn\u0027t anywhere near as easy as shielding other people along with myself. I felt the elastic recoil again as my shield fought to protect me. I had to strain to push it entirely away from me; it took all of my focus. \"Bella!\" Edward whispered in shock. I knew it was working then, so I concentrated even harder, dredging up the specific memories I\u0027d saved for this moment, letting them flood my mind, and hopefully his as well. Some of the memories were not clear - dim human memories, seen through weak eyes and heard through weak ears: the first time I\u0027d seen his face... the way it felt when he\u0027d held me in the meadow... the sound of his voice through the darkness of my faltering consciousness when he\u0027d saved me from James... his face as he waited under a canopy of flowers to marry me... every precious moment from the island... his cold hands touching our baby through my skin... And the sharp memories, perfectly recalled: his face when I\u0027d opened my eyes to my new life, to the endless dawn of immortality... that first kiss... that first night... His lips, suddenly fierce against mine, broke my concentration. With a gasp, I lost my grip on the struggling weight I was holding away from myself. It snapped back like stressed elastic, protecting my thoughts once again. \"Oops, lost it!\" I sighed. \"I heard you,\" he breathed. \"How? How did you do that?\" \"Zafrina\u0027s idea. We practiced with it a few times.\" He was dazed. He blinked twice and shook his head. \"Now you know,\" I said lightly, and shrugged. \"No one\u0027s ever loved anyone as much as I love you.\" \"You\u0027re almost right.\" He smiled, his eyes still a little wider than usual. \"I know of just one exception.\" \"Liar.\" He started to kiss me again, but then stopped abruptly. \"Can you do it again?\" he wondered. I grimaced. \"It\u0027s very difficult.\" He waited, his expression eager. \"I can\u0027t keep it up if I\u0027m even the slightest bit distracted,\" I warned him. \"I\u0027ll be good,\" he promised. I pursed my lips, my eyes narrowing. Then I smiled. I pressed my hands to his face again, hefted the shield right out of my mind, and then started in where I\u0027d left off - with the crystal-clear memory of the first night of my new life... lingering on the details. I laughed breathlessly when his urgent kiss interrupted my efforts again. \"Damn it,\" he growled, kissing hungrily down the edge of my jaw. \"We have plenty of time to work on it,\" I reminded him. \"Forever and forever and forever,\" he murmured. \"That sounds exactly right to me.\" And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever. the end","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-4-breaking-dawn-twilight-4/page-41.html","bookId":2026,"book":{"id":2026,"title":"The Twilight Saga 4: Breaking Dawn (Twilight #4)","description":"Storyline: Breaking Dawn is the fourth novel in the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer.
