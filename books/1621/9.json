{"id":94959,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Trev unbuckled his belt, faced a noisome wall and stared upwards nonchalantly, as a man does in these circumstances. However, most men don\u0027t look up into the astonished faces of two birdlike women who were standing, no, perching on the roof. They screeched Awk! Awk! and flew up into the darkness. Trev scuttled quickly and damply back into the shop. This city got bloody stranger every day. After that, time flew past for Trev, and every second stank of sulphur. He\u0027d seen Nutt dribbling candles, but that was at snail\u0027s pace compared with the speed at which the leather was cut for the ball. But that wasn\u0027t creepy, that was just Nutt. What was creepy was that he didn\u0027t measure anything. Eventually, Trev couldn\u0027t stand it any more, and stopped leaning against the wall, pointed to one of the multi-sided little leather strips and said, \u0027How long is that?\u0027 \u0027One and fifteen sixteenths of an inch.\u0027 \u0027How can you tell without measuring?\u0027 \u0027I do measure, with my eyes. It is a skill. It can be learned.\u0027 \u0027An\u0027 that makes you worthy?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027An\u0027 who judges?\u0027 \u0027I do.\u0027 \u0027Here we are, Mister Nutt, still warm,\u0027 said Glang, arriving from the back of the shop holding something that looked like something taken from an animal that was now, you hoped for its own sake, dead. \u0027Of course, I could do a lot better with more time,\u0027 he continued, \u0027but if you blow down this little tube... \u0027 Trev watched in wonder, and it occurred to him that in all his life he\u0027d made a few candles and a lot of mess. How much was he worth? Gloing! Gloing! Two balls in harmony, thought Trev, but clapped as Nutt and Glang shook hands, then, while they were still admiring their handiwork, he reached behind him and slipped a dagger off the bench and into his pocket. He wasn\u0027t a thief. Oh, fruit off stalls, but everyone knew that didn\u0027t count, and picking a toff\u0027s pocket was just a case of social redistribution, everyone knew that, too, and maybe you found something that looked lost, well, someone would pick it up, so why not you? Weapons got you killed, often because you were holding one. But things were going too far. He had heard Andy\u0027s bones creak and Nutt had brought the man to his knees without sweating. And there were two reasons for taking precautions right there. One was that if you put Andy down you\u0027d better put him out, right out, because he would come back, blood around the corner of his mouth. And two, the worst, was that right now Nutt was more worrying than Andy. At least he knew what Andy was... Carrying a ball each, they hurried back to the university, with Trev keeping a watchful eye on high buildings. \u0027It\u0027s amazin\u0027 what\u0027s turnin\u0027 up in this city,\u0027 he said. \u0027There were a couple of vampire types back there, did you know?\u0027 \u0027Oh, those? They work for Ladyship. They are there for protection.\u0027 \u0027Whose?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Do not worry about them.\u0027 \u0027Hah! And do you know something even stranger has happened this evening?\u0027 said Trev, as the university hove into sight. \u0027You offered that dwarf fifteen dollars and he didn\u0027t even haggle. Like, that\u0027s unheard of. Must be the power of gloing!\u0027 \u0027Yes, but I actually gave him twenty dollars,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Why? He didn\u0027t ask for anythin\u0027 more.\u0027 \u0027No, but he did work very hard and the extra five dollars will more than repay him for the dagger you stole while our backs were turned.\u0027 \u0027I never did!\u0027 said Trev hotly. \u0027Your automatic, unthinking and spring-loaded reply is noted, Mister Trev. As was the sight of the dagger on the bench, shortly followed by the sight of the empty space where the dagger had been. I am not angry, because I saw you most sensibly toss Mister Shank\u0027s wretched cutlass over a wall and I understand your nervousness, but nevertheless I must point out that this is stealing. And so I ask you, as my friend, to take the dagger back in the morning.\u0027 \u0027But that will leave \u0027im up by five dollars and his dagger back.\u0027 Trev sighed. \u0027But at least we\u0027ve got a few dollars each,\u0027 he said, as they entered the back door of the university. \u0027Yes, and then again no, Mister Trev. You will take the remaining five dollars and this rather grubby although genuine receipt for twenty dollars to Mister Stibbons, who thinks you are no good, thus making him doubt his original assumption that you are a thief and a scallywag and assisting your progress in this university.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not a - \u0027 Trev began and stopped, honest enough to acknowledge the knife in his coat. \u0027Honestly, Nutt, you\u0027re one of a kind, you are.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I am coming to that conclusion.\u0027 WOTCHER! The word, in huge type, shouted out from the front page of the Times, next to a big picture of Juliet glittering in micromail and smiling right at the reader. Glenda, frozen for the last fifteen seconds in the act of raising a piece of toast to her mouth, finally bit. Now she blinked and dropped the toast to read: Mystery model \u0027Jewels\u0027 was the toast of an astounding fashion show at Shatta yesterday when she was the very incarnation of micromail, the remarkable metal \u0027cloth\u0027 about which there has been so much speculation in recent months and which, she confirms, Does Not Chafe. She chatted happily and with fetching straightforward earthiness to dignitaries to whom, this writer is certain, no one has ever said \u0027Wotcher\u0027 before. They appeared to find the experience refreshing and entirely without chafe... Glenda stopped reading at this point because the question \u0027How much trouble are we going to get into about this?\u0027 was attempting to fill her whole head. And there was no trouble, was there? And there would not be. There couldn\u0027t be. First, who would think that the beauty in the silver beard, like some goddess of the forge, was a cook\u0027s assistant? And, second, there was no trouble to be had, unless someone tried to make it, in which case they would have to go through Glenda and Glenda would go through them, in very short order. Because Jools was wonderful. She had to admit it. The girl brought radiant sunshine to the page, and suddenly it was plain: it would be a crime to hide all that grace and beauty in a cellar. So what if she had a vocabulary of fewer than seven hundred words? There were more than enough people who were stuffed tight as an egg with words, and who would want to see any of them on the front page? Anyway, she thought, as she pulled her coat on, it would be a nine-minute wonder in any case and besides, she added to herself, it wasn\u0027t as if anyone would spot it was Juliet. After all, she was wearing a beard and that was amazing, because there was no way that a woman in a beard should look attractive, but it worked. Imagine that catching on! You\u0027d have to spend twice as long at the hairdresser\u0027s. Someone\u0027s going to think about that, she thought. There was no sound from the Stollops\u0027 house. She wasn\u0027t surprised. Juliet did not have much grasp of the idea of punctuality. Glenda popped next door to see how the widow Crowdy was and then headed, in the drizzling rain, back to her safe haven of the Night Kitchen. Halfway there an all but forgotten pressure in her bodice reminded her of her duty and she dared go into the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork. Trembling with fear and defiance, she walked up to a clerk at his desk, slapped fifty warm dollars in front of him and said, \u0027I want to start a bank account, all right?\u0027 She left five minutes later with a shiny account book and the delightful recollection that a posh-looking man at a posh-looking desk in a posh-looking building had called her madam, and enjoyed the sensation until it ran into the reality that madam had better roll up her sleeves and get to work. There was a lot to do. She made pies at least a day ahead so that they could mature, and Mister Nutt\u0027s appetite last night had put quite a large dent in her pantry. But at least there wouldn\u0027t be much demand for pies tomorrow night. Even the wizards didn\u0027t call for a pie after a banquet. Ah, yes, the banquet, she thought, as the rain started to soak into her coat. The banquet. She would have to see about the banquet. Sometimes if you wanted to go to the ball you had to be your own fairy godmother. There were several obstacles requiring the touch of a magic wand: Mrs Whitlow did indeed operate a certain kind of apartheid between the Night and Day Kitchens, as if one flight of stairs actually changed who you were. The next difficulty was that Glenda did not have, according to the traditions of the university, the right kind of figure to serve at table, at least when there were visitors, and, lastly, Glenda did not have the temperament for serving at table. It wasn\u0027t that she didn\u0027t know how to smile; she was quite capable of smiling, if you gave her enough warning, but she positively hated having to smile at people who actually merited, instead, a flick around the earhole with a napkin. She hated taking away plates of unfinished food. She always had to suppress a tendency to say things like \u0027Why did you put it on your plate if you didn\u0027t intend to finish it?\u0027 and \u0027Look, you\u0027ve left more than half of it and it cost a dollar a pound,\u0027 and \u0027Of course it\u0027s cold, but that\u0027s because you\u0027ve been playing footsie with the young lady opposite and haven\u0027t been concentrating on your dinner,\u0027 and when all else failed \u0027There\u0027s little children in Klatch you know... \u0027�Cit was a phrase of her mother\u0027s, but she\u0027d obviously missed some significant part of it. She hated waste, she thought to herself as she walked along the stone corridor towards the Night Kitchen. There never needed to be any if you knew your way around a kitchen and if your diners had the decency to take your food seriously. She was rambling to herself. She knew that. Occasionally she would pull the front page of the Times out of her bag and take a look at it again. It had all really happened and there was the proof. But, it was a funny thing: every day something happened that was important enough to be on the front page of the newspaper. She\u0027d never bought it and seen a little sign that said \u0027Not much happened yesterday, sorry about that\u0027. And tomorrow, wonderful though that picture was, it would be wrapping up fish and chips and everyone would have forgotten about it. That would be a load off her mind. There was a polite cough. She recognized it as belonging to Nutt, who had the politest cough there could possibly be. \u0027Yes, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027Mister Trev has sent me with this letter for Miss Juliet, Miss Glenda,\u0027 said Nutt, who had apparently been waiting by the steps. He held it out as if it were some double-edged sword. \u0027She\u0027s not come in yet, I\u0027m afraid,\u0027 said Glenda as Nutt followed her up the steps, \u0027but I\u0027ll put it on the shelf over here where she\u0027ll be bound to see it.\u0027 She looked at Nutt and saw his eyes firmly fixed on the pie racks. \u0027Oh, and I do seem to have made one apple pie more than called for. I wonder if you could assist me by removing it from the premises?\u0027 He gave her a grateful smile, took the pie and hurried away. Alone again, Glenda looked at the envelope. It was the cheapest sort, the kind that looked as if it had been made from recycled lavatory paper. And somehow, it seemed to have got a bit bigger. Inexplicably, she found herself recalling that the gum on those envelopes was so bad that when it came to sealing them it was probably better to just have a very bad cold. Anyone could simply open it up, see what it said, dig out a bit of earwax and no one would be any the wiser. But that would have been a very bad thing to do. Glenda thought that same thought fifteen times before Juliet walked into the Night Kitchen, hung up her coat on the hook and put on her apron. \u0027There was a man on the bus readin\u0027 the paper and it had a picture of me on the front,\u0027 she said excitedly. Glenda nodded and handed over her own paper. \u0027Well, I suppose it\u0027s me,\u0027 said Juliet, with her head on one side. \u0027What shall we do now?\u0027 \u0027Open the damn letter!\u0027 shouted Glenda. \u0027What?\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027Er, oh, Trev sent you a letter,\u0027 said Glenda. She snatched it from the shelf and held it out. \u0027Why don\u0027t you read it right now?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s probably just mucking about.\u0027 \u0027No! Why don\u0027t you just read it right now? I haven\u0027t tried to open it!\u0027 Juliet took the envelope. It opened more or less to a touch. Glenda\u0027s evil side thought, hardly any gum at all! I could have just flicked it open! \u0027I can\u0027t read with you standin\u0027 so close,\u0027 said Juliet. After some time moving her lips she went on, \u0027I don\u0027t get it. It\u0027s all kinda long words. Lovely curly writing, though. There\u0027s a bit here saying that I look like a summer\u0027s day. What\u0027s that all about, then?\u0027 She pressed it into Glenda\u0027s hand. \u0027Can you read it for me, Glendy? You know I\u0027m not good at complicated words.\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027m a bit busy,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027but since you ask.\u0027 \u0027First time I\u0027ve ever had a letter that\u0027s not all in capitals,\u0027 said Juliet. Glenda sat down and started to read. A lifetime of what even she would call bad romantic novels suddenly bore fruit. It read as though someone had turned on the poetry tap and then absent-mindedly gone on holiday. But they were wonderful words, nevertheless. There was the word swain, for example, which was a definite marker, and quite a lot about flowers and quite a lot of what looked like pleading, wrapped up in fancy letters, and after a while she took out her handkerchief and fanned the air around her face. \u0027So, what\u0027s it all about?\u0027 said Juliet. Glenda sighed. How to begin? How did you talk to Juliet about similes and metaphors and poetic licence all wrapped up in wonderful curly writing? She did her best. \u0027Weeell, basically he\u0027s saying that he really fancies you, thinks you\u0027re really fit, how about a date, no hanky panky, he promises. And there\u0027s three little x\u0027s underneath.\u0027 Juliet started to cry. \u0027That\u0027s loverlee. Fancy \u0027im sitting down and writing all those words just for me. Real poetry just for me. I\u0027m gonna sleep with it under my pillow.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I suspect that he had something like that in mind,\u0027 said Glenda and thought, Trev Likely a poet? Not likely at all. There was a dreadful load on Pepe\u0027s bladder, and he was stuck between a rock and a hard place, if that wasn\u0027t too offensive a description of lying between Madame and a wall. She was still asleep. She snored magnificently, using the traditional multi-part snore, known to those who are fortunate enough to have to listen to it every night as the \u0027errgh, errgh, errghh, blorrrt!\u0027 symphony. And she was lying on his leg. And the room was pitch dark. He managed to retrieve his leg, half of which had gone to sleep, and set out on the well-known search for porcelain, which began by him putting his foot down on an empty champagne bottle, which skittered away and left him flat on his back. In the gloom he groped for it, found it, tested it for true emptiness, because you never knew your luck, and, as it were, filled it again, putting it down on what was probably a table, but in his mind and the darkness could just as well have been an armadillo. There was another sound syncopating with Madame\u0027s virtuoso performance. It must have been that which woke him. By groping, he located his shorts and after only three tries managed to get them the right way up and the right way round. They were a little chilly. That was the problem with micromail; it was, after all, metal. On the other hand, it did not chafe and you never had to wash it. Five minutes on the fire and it was as hygienic as anything. Besides, Pepe\u0027s version of the shorts held a surprise all of their own. Thus feeling that he could face the world, or at least the part of it that would need to see only the top of him, he shuffled and stubbed his way to the shop\u0027s door, checking every bottle along the way for evidence of liquid content. Remarkably, a bottle of port had survived with fifty per cent remaining capacity. Any port in a storm, he thought, and drank his breakfast. The shop\u0027s door was rattling. It had a small sliding aperture by which the staff could determine whether they wanted to let a prospective customer in, because when you are a posh shop like Shatta, you don\u0027t sell things to just anyone. Pairs of eyeballs zigzagged back and forth across his vision as people clustered on the other side of the door and fought for attention. Somebody said, \u0027We\u0027re here to see Jewels.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s resting,\u0027 said Pepe. That was always a good line and could mean anything. \u0027Have you seen the picture in the Times?\u0027 said a voice. Then, \u0027Look,\u0027 as a vision of Juliet was held up in front of the door. Blimey, he said to himself. \u0027She had a very tiring day,\u0027 he said. \u0027The public wants to know all about her,\u0027 said a sterner voice. And a rather less aggressive female voice said, \u0027She seems to be rather amazing.\u0027 \u0027She is. She is,\u0027 said Pepe, inventing desperately, \u0027but a very private person and a bit artistic too, if you know what I mean.\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027ve got a big order to place,\u0027 said yet another voice as the owner managed to shuffle for slot space. \u0027Oh, well, we don\u0027t have to wake her up for that. Just give me a moment and I\u0027ll be right with you.\u0027 He took another swig of the port. When he turned around, Madame, in a nightshirt that could have accommodated a platoon, at least if they were very friendly, was bearing down on him with a glass in one hand and the champagne bottle in the other. \u0027This stuff\u0027s gone horribly flat,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll go and find some fresh,\u0027 he replied, snatching it from her quickly. \u0027We\u0027ve got newspaper people and customers out there and they all want Jools. Can you remember where she lives?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure she told me,\u0027 said Madame, \u0027but it all seems a long time ago. That other one, Glenda I think, works at some big place in the city, as a cook. Anyway, why do they want to see her?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s a wonderful picture in the Times,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027You know when you said you thought we\u0027d get rich? Well, it looks like you weren\u0027t thinking big enough.\u0027 \u0027What do you suggest, dear?\u0027 \u0027Me?\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Take the order, because that\u0027s good business, and tell the others that Jools will see them later.\u0027 \u0027Do you think they\u0027ll go for that?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ll have to, because we don\u0027t know where the hell she is. There\u0027s a million dollars walking around this city on legs.\u0027 Rhys, Low King of the Dwarfs, paid particular attention to the picture of the wonderful girl. The definition wasn\u0027t too bad at all. The technique of translating the clacks semaphore signal into a black-and-white picture was quite well advanced these days. Even so, his people in Ankh-Morpork must have thought this particularly interesting to merit the expense of the bandwidth required. Certainly, it was exercising a lot of other dwarfs, but in the Low King\u0027s experience, it was possible to find someone, somewhere, who objected to anything. He looked at the grags in front of him. So simple for people like Vetinari, he thought. He just has religions to deal with. We don\u0027t have religions. Being a dwarf is a religion in itself, and no two priests ever agree, and sometimes it seems that every other dwarf is a priest. \u0027I see nothing here to disturb me,\u0027 he said. \u0027We believe the beard to be a false one,\u0027 said one of the grags. \u0027That is perfectly acceptable,\u0027 said the King. \u0027There is absolutely nothing in any precedent that bans false beards. They are a great salvation to those who find beards hard to grow.\u0027 \u0027But she looks, well, alluring,\u0027 said one of the other grags. They were indistinguishable under their tall, pointed leather cowls. \u0027Attractive, certainly,\u0027 said the King. \u0027Gentlemen, is this going to take long?\u0027 \u0027It must be stopped. It\u0027s not dwarfish.\u0027 \u0027Oh, but it manifestly is, is it not?\u0027 said the King. \u0027Micromail is one hundred per cent mail and you don\u0027t get any more dwarfish than that. She is smiling and while I would agree that dwarfs do not appear to smile very much, certainly not when they come to see me, I think we could profit from her example.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s positively an offence against morality.\u0027 \u0027How? Where? Only in your heads, I feel.\u0027 The tallest grag said, \u0027So you intend to do nothing?\u0027 The King paused for a moment, staring at the ceiling. \u0027No, I intend to do something,\u0027 he said. \u0027First of all, I shall see to it that my staff find out just how many orders there have been for micromail originating from here in Bonk today. I\u0027m sure Shatta would not object to them seeing their records, especially since I intend to tell Madame Sharn that she can come back and establish her premises here.\u0027 \u0027You would do that?\u0027 said a grag. \u0027Yes, of course. We have nearly concluded the Koom Valley Accord, a peace with the trolls that no one ever thought they would see. And I am fed up, gentlemen, with your whining, moaning and endless, endless attempts to re-fight battles that you have already lost. As far as I am concerned, this young lady is showing us a better future and now, if you are not out of my office in ten seconds, I will charge you rent.\u0027 \u0027There will be trouble over this.\u0027 \u0027Gentlemen, there is always trouble! But this time I will be making it for you.\u0027 As the door slammed shut behind them, the King sat back in his chair. \u0027Well done, sir,\u0027 said his secretary. \u0027They\u0027ll keep on. I can\u0027t imagine what being a dwarf would be like if we didn\u0027t argue all the time.\u0027 He squirmed a little in his chair. \u0027You know, they\u0027re right when they say it doesn\u0027t chafe and it\u0027s not as cold as you would imagine. Do ask our agent to express my thanks to Madame Sharn for her generous gift, will you?\u0027 Even this early in the day, the Great Hall of the University was a general thoroughfare. Most of the tables were pushed back against the walls or, if someone felt like showing off, levitated to the ceiling, and the huge black-and-white slabs of the floor, worn smooth by the footfalls of millennia, were polished still further as today\u0027s faculty and students took a short cut to various concerns, destinations and, very occasionally, when no viable excuse presented itself, to lectures. The Great Chandelier had been swung down and off to one side for its daily replenishing of candles, but there was, fortunately for Mustrum Ridcully\u0027s purposes, a large expanse of clear floor. He saw the figure he was waiting for hurrying towards him. \u0027How did it go, Mister Stibbons?\u0027 \u0027Extremely well, I have to say, sir,\u0027 said Ponder. He opened the sack he was carrying. \u0027One of these is our original ball and one of them is the ball that Nutt and Trevor Likely had made last night.\u0027 \u0027Ah, spot the ball,\u0027 said Ridcully. He picked them both up in his enormous hands and dropped them on the flagstones. Gloing! Gloing! \u0027Perfectly identical,\u0027 he said. \u0027Trevor Likely said they had it made by a dwarf for twenty dollars,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Did he really?\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir, and he gave me the change and the receipt.\u0027 \u0027You seem puzzled, Mister Stibbons?\u0027 \u0027Well, yes, sir. I feel I have been rather misjudging him.\u0027 \u0027Possibly even small leopards can change their shorts,\u0027 said Ridcully, slamming him on the back convivially. \u0027Call it score one for human nature. Now, which of these balls is the one that\u0027s going back to the Cabinet?\u0027 \u0027Amazingly, sir, they did think to mark the new ball and there\u0027s a tiny little dot of white paint on this one here... I mean this one here... I think it was here... Ah! Here it is. It\u0027s ours. I\u0027ll send one of the students to put the other one back shortly. We still have an hour and a half.\u0027 \u0027No, I\u0027d rather you did it yourself, Mister Stibbons, I\u0027m sure it would only take a few minutes. Do hurry back, I\u0027d like to try a little experiment.\u0027 When Ponder returned, he found Ridcully loitering unobtrusively by one of the big doors. \u0027You have your notebook ready, Mister Stibbons?\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027And a fresh pencil, Archchancellor.\u0027 \u0027Very well, then. The experiment begins.\u0027 Ridcully gently rolled the new football out on to the floor, straightened up and glanced at his stopwatch. \u0027Ah, the ball has been kicked aside by the Professor of Illiberal Studies, quite possibly by accident... Now one of the bledlows, Mister Hipney I think his name is, has kicked it somewhat uncertainly. One of the students, Pondlife, I believe, has prodded it back... We have momentum, Mister Stibbons. Undirected, it is true, but promising. Ah, but we can\u0027t have this... \u0027No touching the ball with your hands, gentlemen!\u0027 shouted the Archchancellor, deftly trapping the travelling ball with his boot. \u0027That\u0027s a rule! We really could do with that whistle, Stibbons.\u0027 He bounced the ball on the stone floor. Gloing! \u0027Don\u0027t just mess about like kids kicking a tin! Play football! I am the Archchancellor of this university, by Io, and I will rusticate, or otherwise expel, any man who skives off without a note from his mother, hah!\u0027 Gloing! \u0027You will arrange yourself into two teams, set up goals and strive to win! No man will leave the field of play unless injured! The hands are not to be used, is that clear? Any questions?\u0027 A hand went up. Ridcully sought the attached face. \u0027Ah, Rincewind,\u0027 he said, and, because he was not a determinedly unpleasant man, amended this to, \u0027Professor Rincewind, of course.\u0027 \u0027I would like permission to fetch a note from my mother, sir.\u0027 Ridcully sighed. \u0027Rincewind, you once informed me, to my everlasting puzzlement, that you never knew your mother because she ran away before you were born. Distinctly remember writing it down in my diary. Would you like another try?\u0027 \u0027Permission to go and find my mother?\u0027 Ridcully hesitated. The Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography had no students and no real duties other than to stay out of trouble. Although Ridcully would never admit it, it was against all reason an emeritus position. Rincewind was a coward and an unwitting clown, but he had several times saved the world in slightly puzzling circumstances. He was a luck sink, the Archchancellor had decided, doomed to being a lightning rod for the fates so that everyone else didn\u0027t have to. Such a person was worth all his meals and laundry (including an above-average level of soiled pants) and a bucket of coal every day even if he was, in Ridcully\u0027s opinion, a bit of a whiner. However, he was fast, and therefore useful. \u0027Look,\u0027 said Rincewind, \u0027a mysterious urn turns up and suddenly it\u0027s all about football. That bodes. It means something bad is going to happen.\u0027 \u0027Come now, it could be something wonderful,\u0027 Ridcully protested. Rincewind appeared to give this due consideration. \u0027Could be wonderful, will be dreadful. Sorry, that\u0027s how it goes.\u0027 \u0027This is Unseen University, Rincewind. What is there to fear?\u0027 Ridcully said. \u0027Apart from me, of course. Good heavens, this is a sport.\u0027 He raised his voice. \u0027Arrange yourselves into two teams and play football!\u0027 He stepped back and joined Ponder. The dragooned footballers, having been given clear instructions in a loud voice, went into a huddle to find out by hubbub what they should actually do instead. \u0027I can\u0027t believe this,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Every boy knows what to do when they\u0027ve found something to kick, don\u0027t they?\u0027 He cupped his hands. \u0027Come on, two captains step up. I don\u0027t care who it is.\u0027 This took rather more time than might have been expected since those who had not surreptitiously left the Hall could see that the post of football captain was one that offered a wonderful chance for being the target of the Archchancellor\u0027s mercurial wrath. Eventually two sacrifices were pushed forward and found it too difficult to push their way back into the ranks again. \u0027Now, I say again, pick the teams alternately.\u0027 He took off his hat and flung it to the ground. \u0027Now we all understand this! It\u0027s a boy thing! It\u0027s like little girls and the colour pink! You know how to do this! Pick the teams alternately so one of you ends up with the weird kid and the other with the fat kid. Some of the fastest mathematics of all time has been achieved by team captains trying not to end up with the weird kid - Stay where you are, Rincewind!\u0027 Ponder gave an involuntary shudder as his schooldays came running back, jeering at him. The fat kid in his class had been the unfortunately named \u0027Piggy\u0027 Love, whose father owned a sweet shop, which gave the son some weight in the community, not to mention clout. That had left only the weird kid as the natural target for the other boys, which meant a chronic hell for Ponder until that wonderful day when sparks came out of Ponder\u0027s fingers and Martin Sogger\u0027s pants caught fire. He could smell them now. Best days of your life be buggered; the Archchancellor could be a bit crass and difficult at times, but at least he wasn\u0027t allowed to give you a wedgie - \u0027Are you listening to me, Stibbons?\u0027 Ponder blinked. \u0027Er, sorry, sir, I was... calculating.\u0027 \u0027I said, who\u0027s the tall feller with the tan and the dinky beard?\u0027 \u0027Oh, that\u0027s Professor Bengo Macarona, Archchancellor. From Genua, remember? He\u0027s swapped with Professor Maidenhair for a year.\u0027 \u0027Oh, right. Poor old Maidenhair. Perhaps he won\u0027t get laughed at so much in a foreign language. And Mister Macarona\u0027s here to better himself, yes? Put a bit of polish on his career, no doubt.\u0027 \u0027Hardly, sir. He\u0027s got doctorates from Unki, QIS and Chubb, thirteen in all, and a visiting professorship at Bugarup, and he has been cited in two hundred and thirty-six papers and, er, one divorce petition.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027The rule about celibacy isn\u0027t taken seriously over there, sir. Very hot-blooded people, I understand, of course. His family owns a huge ranch and the biggest coffee plantation outside Klatch, and I think his grandmother owns the Macarona Shipping Company.\u0027 \u0027So why the hell did he come here?\u0027 \u0027He wants to work with the best, sir,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027I think he\u0027s serious.\u0027 \u0027Really? Oh, well, he seems like a sensible chap, then. Er, the divorce thing?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know much, sir, it got hushed up, I believe.\u0027 \u0027Angry husband?\u0027 \u0027Angry wife, as I heard it,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Oh, he was married, was he?\u0027 \u0027Not to my knowledge, Archchancellor.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think I quite understand,\u0027 said Ridcully. Ponder, who was not at all at home in this area, said very slowly, \u0027She was the wife of another man... I, er, believe, sir.\u0027 \u0027But I - \u0027 To Ponder\u0027s relief, light dawned on Ridcully\u0027s huge face. \u0027Oh, you mean he was like Professor Hayden. We used to have a name for him... \u0027 Ponder braced himself. \u0027Snakes. Very keen on them, you know. Could talk for hours about snakes with a side order of lizards. Very keen.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m glad you feel like that, Archchancellor, because I know that a number of the students - \u0027 \u0027And then there was old Postule, who was in the rowing team. Coxed us through two wonderful years.\u0027 Ponder\u0027s expression did not change, but for a few moments his face went pink and shiny. \u0027A lot of that sort of thing about, apparently,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027People make such a fuss. Anyway, in my opinion there\u0027s not enough love in the world. Besides, if you didn\u0027t like the company of men you wouldn\u0027t come here in the first place. I say! Well done, that man!\u0027 This was because, in the absence of Ridcully\u0027s attention, the footballers had at last started their own kick-about and some quite fancy footwork was emerging. \u0027Yes, what?\u0027 A bledlow had appeared alongside Ridcully. \u0027Gentleman to see the Archchancellor, sir. He\u0027s a wizard, sir. The, er, the Dean, as was, only he says he\u0027s an Archchancellor too.\u0027 Ridcully hesitated, but you\u0027d have had to be an experienced Ridcully watcher, like Ponder, to notice the moment. When the Archchancellor spoke, it was calmly and carefully, every word hammered on the anvil of self-control. \u0027What a pleasant surprise, Mister Nobbs. Do show the Dean in. Oh, and please do not glance at Mister Stibbons for confirmation, thank you. I am still the Archchancellor in these parts. The only one, in fact. Is there a problem, Mister Stibbons?\u0027 \u0027Well, sir, it is a bit public in here - \u0027 Ponder stopped, because suddenly he had nobody\u0027s attention. He hadn\u0027t seen the ball bounce towards Bledlow Nobbs (no relation). Nor the vicious kick the latter gave it, just as he would an impertinent intrusion by a street urchin\u0027s tin can. Ponder did see the ball curving majestically through the air, heading for the other end of the Hall where, behind the organ, rose the stained-glass window dedicated to Archchancellor Abasti, which on a daily basis showed one of several thousand scenes of a mystical or spiritual nature. The intuition with which Ponder had successfully calculated the distance and trajectory of the ball told him that the current glowing picture of \u0027Bishop Horn realizing that the alligator quiche was an unwise choice\u0027 had appeared just in time to be extremely unlucky. And then, like some new planet swimming into the ken of a watcher of the skies, as they are prone to do, a rusty red shape arose, unfolding as it came, snatched the ball out of the air and landed on the organ keyboard to the sound of gloing! in B flat. \u0027Well done, that ape!\u0027 the Archchancellor boomed. \u0027A beautiful save, but, regrettably, against the rules!\u0027 To Ponder\u0027s surprise there was a murmur of dissent from all the players. \u0027I believe that decision may benefit from some consideration,\u0027 said a small voice behind them. \u0027Who said that?\u0027 said Ridcully, spinning round and looking into the suddenly terrified little eyes of Nutt. \u0027Nutt, sir. The candle dribbler. We met yesterday. I helped you with the ball... ?\u0027 \u0027And you are telling me I\u0027m wrong. Are you?\u0027 \u0027I would rather you thought of me as suggesting a way in which you could be even more right.\u0027 Ridcully opened his mouth and then shut it again. I know what he is, he thought. Does he? Or did they spare him that? \u0027Very well, Mister Nutt. Is there a point you wish to make?\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir. What is the purpose of this game?\u0027 \u0027To win, of course!\u0027 \u0027Indeed. Regrettably, it is not being played that way.\u0027 \u0027It isn\u0027t?\u0027 \u0027No, sir. The players all want to kick the ball.\u0027 \u0027And so they should, surely?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Only if you believe the purpose of the game is healthy exercise, sir. Do you play chess?\u0027 \u0027Well, I have done.\u0027 \u0027And would you have thought it proper for all the pawns to swarm up the board in the hope of checkmating the king?\u0027 For a moment, Ridcully had a mental vision of Lord Vetinari holding aloft a solitary pawn and saying what it might become... \u0027Oh, come now, that is quite different!\u0027 he burst out. \u0027Yes, but the skill lies in marshalling resources in the right way.\u0027 Ridcully saw a face appear behind Nutt, like a rising moon of wrath. \u0027You don\u0027t talk to the gentlemen, Nutt, it is not your place to take up their time with your chatter - \u0027 Ridcully writhed in sympathy with Nutt, all the more so because Smeems, as is the habit of such people, kept looking at the Archchancellor as if seeking and, worse, expecting approval of this petty tyranny. But authority must back up authority, in public at least, otherwise there is no authority, and therefore the senior authority is forced to back up the junior authority, even if he, the senior authority, believes that the junior authority is a tiresome little tit. \u0027Thank you for your concern, Mister Smeems,\u0027 he said, \u0027but in fact I asked Mister Nutt his opinion of our little kick-about, since it is the game of the people and he is rather more people than I am. I will not keep him long from his duties, Mister Smeems, nor you from yours, which I know are both vital and pressing.\u0027 Small, insecure authority can spot, if it is sensible, when a larger authority is giving it a chance to save face. \u0027Right you are, sir!\u0027 said Smeems after only a second\u0027s hesitation, and he scurried off to safety. The thing called Nutt appeared to be trembling. He thinks he\u0027s done something wrong, Ridcully thought, and I shouldn\u0027t think of him as a thing. Some wizard\u0027s sense made him look round into the face of�Cwhat was the lad\u0027s name?�CTrevor Likely. \u0027Do you have anything else to add, Mister Likely? Only I\u0027m a bit busy at the moment.\u0027 \u0027I gave Mister Stibbons the change and the receipt,\u0027 said Trevor. \u0027What is it you do around here, young man?\u0027 \u0027I run the candle vats, guv.\u0027 \u0027Oh, do you? We\u0027re getting some very good dribbling from you fellows these days.\u0027 Trev appeared to let this pass. \u0027Mister Nutt is not in any trouble, is he, guv?\u0027 \u0027Not to my knowledge.\u0027 But what do I know? Ridcully asked himself. Mr Nutt, by definition, is trouble. But the Librarian says he potters about repairing things and is generally an amiable milksop, and he talks as though he\u0027s giving a lecture. This little man, who actually, when you look at him, is not as little as he appears because he weighs himself down with humility... this little man was born with a name so fearsome some peasants chained him to an anvil because they were too scared to kill him. Perhaps Vetinari and his friends are right in their smug way and a leopard can change his shorts. I hope so, because if they aren\u0027t, a leopard will be a picnic. And any minute now, the Dean is coming, damn his treacherous hide. \u0027Only he\u0027s my friend, guv.\u0027 \u0027Well, that\u0027s good. Everyone should have a friend.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not gonna let anyone touch \u0027im, guv.\u0027 \u0027A brave ambition, young man, if I may say so. Nevertheless, Mister Nutt, why did you object when I pointed out that the Librarian, wonderful though his rising save was, was in infringement of the rules?\u0027 Nutt didn\u0027t look up, but in a small voice said, \u0027It was elegant. It was beautiful. The game should be beautiful, like a well-executed war.\u0027 \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t think many people would say that war is very jolly,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Beauty can be considered to be neutral, sir. It is not the same as nice or good.\u0027 \u0027I thought it was the same as truth, though,\u0027 said Ponder, trying to keep up. \u0027Which is often horrible, sir, but Mister Librarian\u0027s leap was both beautiful, sir, and good, sir, and therefore must be true and therefore the rule which should prevent him from doing it again would be proved to be neither beautiful nor true and would, indeed, be a false law.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right, guv,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027People will shout for that stuff.\u0027 \u0027Do you mean that they\u0027d cheer for a goal not achieved?\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Of course they will! And groan! It\u0027s something happening,\u0027 Ridcully snorted. \u0027You saw the game the other day! If you were lucky, you got a glimpse of a lot of large, grubby men fighting over a ball like a lump of wood. People want to see goals scored!\u0027 \u0027And saved, remember!\u0027 Trev pointed out. \u0027Exactly, young man,\u0027 agreed Ridcully. \u0027It must be a game of speed. This is the year of the Pensive Hare, after all. People get bored so easily. No wonder there are fights. We need, do we not, to make a sport that is more exciting than beating other people over the head with big weapons.\u0027 \u0027That one\u0027s always been very popular,\u0027 said Ponder doubtfully. \u0027Well, we are wizards, after all. And now I must go and greet the bloody, the so-called Archchancellor of Brazeneck so-called College in the correct damn spirit of fraternal goodwill!\u0027 \u0027So called,\u0027 murmured Ponder, not quite softly enough. \u0027What say?\u0027 the Archchancellor bellowed. \u0027Just wondering what you want me to do, Archchancellor?\u0027 \u0027Do? Keep \u0027em playing! See who\u0027s good at it! Work out what the most beautiful rules are,\u0027 Ridcully called out, heading out of the Hall at speed. \u0027By myself?\u0027 said Ponder, horrified. \u0027I\u0027ve got a huge workload!\u0027 \u0027Delegate!\u0027 \u0027You know I\u0027m hopeless at delegating, sir!\u0027 \u0027Then delegate the job of delegating to someone who isn\u0027t! Now, I must be off before he steals the silverware!\u0027 It was very rare for Glenda to take time off. Being the head of the Night Kitchen was a mental state, not a physical one. The only meal she ever ate at home was breakfast, and that was always in a hurry. But now she\u0027d stolen some time to sell the dream. May Hedges was looking after the kitchen and she was reliable and got on with everyone and so there were no worries there. The sun had come out and now she knocked on the rear door of Mr Stronginthearm\u0027s workshop. The dwarf opened the door with rouge all over his fingers. \u0027Oh, hello, Glenda. How\u0027s it going?\u0027 She thumped a wad of orders on the table proudly and opened the suitcase. It was empty. \u0027And I need a lot more samples,\u0027 she said. \u0027Oh, that\u0027s wonderful,\u0027 said the dwarf. \u0027When did you get these?\u0027 \u0027This morning.\u0027 It had been easy. Door after door seemed to have opened for her and every time a little voice in her head said, \u0027Are you doing the right thing?\u0027 a slightly deeper voice, which sounded remarkably like Madame Sharn, said, \u0027He wants to make it. You want to sell it. They want to buy it. The dream goes round and round and so does the money.\u0027 \u0027The lipstick went down very well,\u0027 she said. \u0027Those troll girls put it on with a trowel and I\u0027m not kidding. So what you ought to do, sir, is sell a trowel. A pretty one, in a nice box with sprinkles on it.\u0027 He gave her an admiring look. \u0027This isn\u0027t like you, Glenda.\u0027 \u0027Not sure about that,\u0027 said Glenda, as more samples were dropped into the battered case. \u0027Have you thought about getting into shoes?\u0027 \u0027Do you think it would be worth a try? They don\u0027t normally wear shoes.\u0027 \u0027They didn\u0027t wear lipstick until they moved here,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027It could be the coming thing.\u0027 \u0027But they\u0027ve got feet like granite. They don\u0027t need shoes.\u0027 \u0027But they\u0027ll want them,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You could be in on the ground floor, as it were.\u0027 Stronginthearm looked puzzled and Glenda remembered that even city dwarfs were used to the topsy-turvy language of home. \u0027Oh, sorry, I meant to say the top floor.\u0027 \u0027And then there\u0027s dresses,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I\u0027ve been looking around and no one makes proper dresses for trolls. They\u0027re just outsized human dresses. And they\u0027re cut to make the troll look smaller, but they\u0027d be better if they were cut to make them look bigger. More like a troll and less like a fat human. You know, you want the clothing to shout, \"I\u0027m a great big troll lady and proud of it\".\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-9.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .).
