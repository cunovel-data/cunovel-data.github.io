{"id":94961,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"There was a yell in the distance. And then a crash. Ridcully smiled. The day had suddenly brightened up.\\n\\n When he and Ponder reached the Great Hall, most of the team were gathered around one of their members lying on the floor, with Nutt kneeling over him.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s happened here?\u0027 Ridcully demanded.\\n\\n \u0027Badly bruised, sir. I shall put a compress on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah.\u0027 His gaze fell upon a large, brass-bound chest. It looked at first sight like any other chest, until you saw the tiny little toes poking out.\\n\\n \u0027Rincewind\u0027s luggage,\u0027 he growled. \u0027And where that is, Rincewind can\u0027t be far in front. Rincewind!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Actually, it wasn\u0027t my fault,\u0027 said Rincewind.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s right, sir,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I have to apologize for the fact that this was a group misapprehension. I understand it is a remarkably magical chest on hundreds of little legs and I am afraid that the gentlemen here believed that it would play football like stink, as they put it. In which surmise, I have to say, they were proved wrong.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I tried to tell them,\u0027 said the former Dean from the edge of the crowd. \u0027Morning, Mustrum. Good team you have here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All its feet do is get in each other\u0027s way,\u0027 said Bengo Macarona. \u0027And if it does get on top of the ball, it spins out of control and, alas, it crashed into Mister Sopworthy here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, well, we learn by our mistakes,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027And now, do you happen to have something nice to show me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think I have the very thing, Archchancellor,\u0027 said a cheerful but reedy voice behind him.\\n\\n Ridcully turned and looked into the face of a man with the shape and urgency of a piccolo. He seemed to be vibrating on the spot.\\n\\n \u0027Professor Ritornello, Master of the Music,\u0027 Ponder whispered into Ridcully\u0027s ear.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, Professor,\u0027 said Ridcully smoothly, \u0027and I see you have the choir with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes indeed, Archchancellor, and I must tell you, I am thrilled and filled with inner light by what I have witnessed this morning! Without ado, I have penned a chant, such as you asked for!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did I?\u0027 said Ridcully, out of the corner of his mouth.\\n\\n \u0027You will remember that chanting was mentioned and so I thought it best to alert the professor,\u0027 whispered Ponder.\\n\\n \u0027Another pp, eh? Oh, well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Happily, it is based on the traditional plainchant or stolation form and is a valedicta, or hail to the winner. May I?\u0027 said Professor Ritornello. \u0027It is a cappella, of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go ahead, by all means,\u0027 said Ridcully.\\n\\n The Master of the Music pulled a short baton out of his sleeve. \u0027I\u0027ve put the name of Bengo Macarona in there for a marker at the moment, because he has apparently scored two fine \"goals\", as I believe they are called,\u0027 he said, dealing carefully with the word as one might deal with a large spider in the bathtub. Then he caught the eyes of his little flock, nodded, and: Hail the unique qualities of Magister Bengo Macarona! Of Macarona the unique qualities Hail! Hail the! Hail the! The singular talent possessed by no other! Hail! Hail the! Hail the bountiful gods! Who to the, two the - SINGULA SINGULAR SINGULA!\\n\\n After a minute and a half of this Ridcully coughed loudly, and the Master waved the choir into a stuttering silence.\\n\\n \u0027Is there something untoward, Archchancellor?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Er, not as such, Master, but, er, do you not feel that it is a bit too, well, long?\u0027 Ridcully was aware that the former Dean was not trying very hard to suppress a snigger.\\n\\n \u0027Not at all. In fact, sir, I intend that when it is finished it will be scored for forty voices and, though I dare to say so, will be my masterwork!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it is something for football fans to sing, you see?\u0027 said Ridcully.\\n\\n \u0027Well then,\u0027 said the Master, holding his baton in a rather threatening manner, \u0027is it not the duty of the educated classes to raise the standards of the lower orders?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s got a point there, Mustrum,\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies, and Ridcully felt his grandfather kick him in the heredity, and was glad that maid wasn\u0027t here-what was her name now? Oh, yes, Glenda, smart woman-but although she was not there he saw something of her expression in Trev Likely\u0027s face.\\n\\n \u0027During the week, possibly,\u0027 he snapped, \u0027but not on Saturdays, I think. But very well done, anyway, and I look forward to hearing more of your efforts.\u0027\\n\\n The Master of the Music flounced out with the choir flouncing out in perfect unison behind him.\\n\\n Ridcully rubbed his hands together. \u0027Well, gentlemen, perhaps you could show me your moves.\u0027\\n\\n While the players spread out in the Hall, Nutt said, \u0027I must say that Professor Macarona is excelling at the game. He clearly has excellent ball skills.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not surprised,\u0027 said Ridcully brightly.\\n\\n \u0027The Librarian is, of course, an excellent keeper of the goal. Especially since he can stand in the middle and reach either side of it. I believe that it will be very hard for any of our opponents to get past him. And, of course, you will be partaking also, Archchancellor.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, you don\u0027t become Archchancellor if you don\u0027t get the hang of things quickly. I will just watch for now.\u0027\\n\\n He watched. After the second occasion when Macarona, like a silver streak, ran the length of the Hall to flick the ball into the opponents\u0027 goal, Ridcully turned to Ponder and said, \u0027We\u0027re going to win, aren\u0027t we?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If indeed he is still playing for you,\u0027 put in the former Dean.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, come now, Henry. Can we at least agree to just play one game at a time here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I think today\u0027s session should end pretty soon, sir,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027It\u0027s the banquet tonight after all and it will take some time to get the place ready.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me, guv, that\u0027s right,\u0027 said Trev behind him, \u0027and we\u0027ve got to get the chandelier down an\u0027 put new candles in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but we have been practising a little demonstration for tonight. Maybe the Archchancellor would like to see it,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n Ridcully looked at his watch. \u0027Well, yes, Mister Nutt, but time is getting on and so I look forward to seeing it later. Splendid effort all round, though,\u0027 he boomed.\\n\\n The night market was setting up in Sator Square as Glenda and Juliet arrived for work. Ankh-Morpork lived on the street, where it got its food, entertainment and, in a city with a ferocious housing shortage, a place to hang around until there was space on a floor. Stalls had been set up anywhere, and flares filled the early-evening air with stink and, almost as a by-product, a certain amount of light.\\n\\n Glenda could never resist looking, especially now. She was very good at all sorts of cookery, she really was, and it was important to keep that knowledge at the calm centre of her spinning brain. And there was Verity Pushpram, queen of the sea.\\n\\n Glenda had a lot of time for Miss Pushpram, who was a self-made woman, although she could have used some help when it came to her eyes, which were set so far apart that she rather resembled a turbot.\\n\\n But Verity, like the ocean that was making her fortune these days, had hidden depths, because she\u0027d made enough to buy a boat, and then another boat and a whole aisle in the fish market. But she still woman-handled her barrow to the square most evenings, where she sold whelks, shrimps, leather crabs, blossom prawns, monkey clams and her famous hot fish sticks.\\n\\n Glenda often bought from her; there was the kind of respect you give to an equal who is, crucially, no threat to your own position.\\n\\n \u0027Going to the big bun fight, girls?\u0027 said Verity cheerfully, waving a halibut at them.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Juliet proudly.\\n\\n \u0027What, both of you?\u0027 said Verity, with a glance towards Glenda, who said, firmly, \u0027The Night Kitchen is expanding.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh well, so long as you\u0027re having fun,\u0027 said Verity, looking, in theory, from one to the other. \u0027Here, have one of these, they\u0027re lovely. My treat.\u0027\\n\\n She reached down and picked a crab out of a bucket. As it came up it turned out that three more were hanging on to it.\\n\\n \u0027A crab necklace?\u0027 giggled Juliet.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, that\u0027s crabs for you,\u0027 said Verity, disentangling the ones who had hitched a ride. \u0027Thick as planks, the lot of them. That\u0027s why you can keep them in a bucket without a lid. Any that tries to get out gets pulled back. Yes, as thick as planks.\u0027 Verity held the crab over an ominously bubbling cauldron. \u0027Shall I cook it for you now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027 said Glenda, much louder than she had intended.\\n\\n \u0027Are you okay, dear?\u0027 Verity enquired. \u0027You look a bit ill.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m fine. Fine. Just a touch of a sore throat, that\u0027s all.\u0027 Crab bucket, she thought. I thought Pepe was talking nonsense. \u0027Erm, can you just truss it up for us? It\u0027s going to be a long night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right you are,\u0027 said Miss Pushpram, expertly wrapping the unresisting crab in twine. \u0027You know what to do, that\u0027s certain. Lovely crabs, these, real good eating. But thick as planks.\u0027\\n\\n Crab bucket, thought Glenda as they hurried towards the Night Kitchen. That\u0027s how it works. People from the Sisters disapproving when a girl takes the trolley bus. That\u0027s crab bucket. Practically everything my mum ever told me, that\u0027s crab bucket. Practically everything I\u0027ve ever told Juliet, that\u0027s crab bucket, too. Maybe it\u0027s just another word for the Shove. It\u0027s so nice and warm on the inside that you forget that there\u0027s an outside. The worst of it is, the crab that mostly keeps you down is you... The realization had her mind on fire.\\n\\n A lot hinges on the fact that, in most circumstances, people are not allowed to hit you with a mallet. They put up all kinds of visible and invisible signs that say \u0027Do not do this\u0027 in the hope that it\u0027ll work, but if it doesn\u0027t, then they shrug, because there is, really, no real mallet at all. Look at Juliet talking to all those nobby ladies. She didn\u0027t know that she shouldn\u0027t talk to them like that. And it worked! Nobody hit her on the head with a hammer.\\n\\n And custom and practice as embodied by Mrs Whitlow was that the Night Kitchen staff should not go above stairs, to where the light was comparatively clean and had not already been through a lot of other eyeballs. Well, Glenda had done that, and nothing bad had happened, had it? So now Glenda strode towards the Great Hall, her serviceable shoes hitting the floor enough to hurt. The Day girls said nothing as she marched in behind them. There was nothing for them to say. The real unwritten rule was that girls on the dumpy side didn\u0027t serve at table when guests were present, and Glenda had decided tonight that she couldn\u0027t read unwritten rules. Besides, there was a row already going on. The servants who were laying out the cutlery were trying to keep an eye on it, which subsequently meant that more than one guest had to eat with two spoons.\\n\\n Glenda was amazed to see the Candle Knave waving his hands at Trev and Nutt, and she headed for them. She did not like Smeems very much; a man could be dogmatic, and that was all right, or he could be stupid, and no harm done, but stupid and dogmatic at the same time was too much, especially fluxed with body odour.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s this all about?\u0027\\n\\n It worked. The right tone from a woman with her arms folded always bounces an answer out of an unprepared man before he has time to think, and even before he has time to think up a lie.\\n\\n \u0027They raised the chandelier! They raised it without lighting the candles! We won\u0027t have enough time now to get it down and up again before the guests come in!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But, Mister Smeems - \u0027 Trev began.\\n\\n \u0027And all I get is talking back and lies,\u0027 Smeems complained bitterly.\\n\\n \u0027But I can light them from here, Mister Smeems.\u0027 Nutt spoke quietly, even his voice huddling.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t give me that! Even wizards can\u0027t do that without getting wax all over the place, you little - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s enough, Mister Smeems,\u0027 said a voice that to Glenda\u0027s surprise turned out to be hers. \u0027Can you light them, Mister Nutt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, miss. At the right time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There you are, then,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I suggest you leave it to Mister Nutt.\u0027 Smeems looked at her, and she could see there was, as it were, an invisible mallet in his thinking, a feeling that he might get into some trouble here.\\n\\n \u0027I should run along now,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t stand around. I\u0027m a man with responsibilities.\u0027 Smeems looked wrong-footed and bewildered, but from his point of view absence was a good idea. Glenda almost saw his brain reach the conclusion. Not being there diluted the blame for whatever it was that was going to go wrong. \u0027Can\u0027t stand around,\u0027 he repeated. \u0027Ha! You\u0027d all be in the dark if it wasn\u0027t for me!\u0027 With that, he grabbed his greasy bag and scuttled off.\\n\\n Glenda turned to Nutt. He can\u0027t possibly make himself smaller, she told herself. His clothes would fit him even worse than they do already. I must be imagining it.\\n\\n \u0027Can you really light the candles from here?\u0027 she said aloud. Nutt carried on staring at the floor.\\n\\n Glenda turned to Trev. \u0027Can he really - \u0027 but Trev was not there, because Trev was leaning against the wall some distance away talking to Juliet.\\n\\n She could read it all at a glance, his possessive stance, her modestly downcast eyes: not hanky panky, as such, but certainly overture and beginners to hanky panky. Oh, the power of words...\\n\\n As you watch, so are you watched. Glenda looked down into the penetrating eyes of Nutt. Was that a frown? What had he seen in her expression? More than she wanted, that was certain.\\n\\n The tempo in the Hall was increasing. The football captains would be assembling in one of the anterooms, and she could imagine them there, in clean shirts, or at least in shirts less grubby than usual, dragged here from the various versions of Botney Street all over the city, staring up at the wonderful vaulting and wondering if they were going to walk out of there dead. Huh, she tagged on to that thought, more likely it would be dead drunk. And, just as her brain began to pivot around that new thought, a severe voice behind her said, \u0027Hwe do not usually expect to see you in the Great Hall, Glenda?\u0027\\n\\n It had to be Mrs Whitlow. Only the housekeeper would pronounce \u0027we\u0027 with an H and finish a plain statement as if it were a question. Besides, without turning round, Glenda heard the clink of her silver chatelaine, reputed to hold the one key that could open any lock in the university, and the creaking of her fearsome corsetry.\\n\\n Glenda turned. There is no mallet! \u0027I thought you might need a few extra hands tonight, Mrs Whitlow,\u0027 she said sweetly.\\n\\n \u0027Nevertheless, custom and practice - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah, dear Mrs Whitlow, I think we\u0027re ready to let them through now. His lordship\u0027s coach will shortly be leaving the palace,\u0027 said the Archchancellor, behind them.\\n\\n Mrs Whitlow could loom. But mostly only horizontally. Mustrum Ridcully could out-loom her by more than two feet. She turned hurriedly and gave the little half-curtsy which, he\u0027d never dared tell her, he always found mildly annoying.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, and Miss Glenda, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said the Archchancellor happily. \u0027Good to see you up here. Very useful young lady, Mrs Whitlow. Got initiative, fine grasp of things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How kind of you to say so. She is one of my best girls,\u0027 said the housekeeper, spitting teeth and taking care not to meet Glenda\u0027s suddenly cherubic gaze.\\n\\n \u0027Big chandelier not lit, I see,\u0027 said Ridcully.\\n\\n Glenda stepped forward. \u0027Mister Nutt is planning a surprise for us, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mister Nutt is full of surprises. We\u0027ve had an amazing day here today, Miss Glenda,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Our Mister Nutt has been teaching the lads to play football his way. Do you know what he did yesterday? You\u0027ll never guess. Tell them, Mister Nutt.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I took them along to the Royal Opera House to watch the dancers in training,\u0027 said Nutt nervously. \u0027You see, it is very important that they learn the skills of movement and poise.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And then when they came back,\u0027 said Ridcully, with the same, slightly threatening joviality, \u0027he had them playin\u0027 here in the Hall blindfolded.\u0027\\n\\n Nutt coughed nervously. \u0027It is vital for them to keep track of every other player,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is essential that they are a team.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And then he took them to see Lord Rust\u0027s hunting dogs.\u0027\\n\\n Nutt coughed again, even more embarrassed. \u0027When they hunt, every dog knows the position of every other dog. I wanted them to understand the duality of team and player. The strength of the player is the team and the strength of the team is the player.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you hear that?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Great stuff! Oh, he\u0027s had them running up and down here all day long. Balancing balls on their heads, doing big diagrams on a blackboard. You\u0027d think it was some kind of battle being planned.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is a battle,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I mean, not with the opposing team, as such, but it is a battle between every man and himself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That sounds very Uberwaldian,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Still, they all seem full of vim and vigour and ready for the evening. I think Mister Nutt is planning one of those sunny luminair things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just a little something to capture people\u0027s attention,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027Anything going to go off bang?\u0027 said Ridcully.\\n\\n \u0027No, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Promise? Personally I like the occasional bit of Sturm and Drang, but Lord Vetinari is a tad particular about that sort of thing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No thunder and lightning, sir. Possibly a brief haze, high up.\u0027\\n\\n It seemed to Glenda that the Archchancellor was paying some thoughtful attention to Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027How many languages do you speak, you... Nutt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Three dead and twelve living, sir,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027Really. Really,\u0027 said Ridcully, as though filing this away and trying not to think How many of them were alive before you murdered them? \u0027Well done. Thank you, Mister Nutt, and you too, ladies. We will bring them in shortly.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda took this opportunity to get out of Mrs Whitlow\u0027s way. She was not pleased to see that Trev and Juliet had already taken a slightly earlier opportunity to get out of hers.\\n\\n \u0027Do not worry about Juliet,\u0027 said Nutt, who had followed her.\\n\\n \u0027Who said I was worried?\u0027 Glenda snapped.\\n\\n \u0027You did. Your expression, your stance, the set of your body, your... reactions, your tone of voice. Everything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have no business to be looking at my everything�CI mean the set of my body!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is simply the way you stand, Miss Glenda.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you can read my mind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It may appear that way. I am so sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And Juliet. What was she thinking?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am not sure, but she likes Mister Trev, she thinks he is funny.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So have you read Trev\u0027s everything? Bet that was a dirty book!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Er, no, miss. He is worried and confused. I would say he is trying to see what kind of man he is going to be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really? He\u0027s always been a scallywag.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He is thinking of his future.\u0027\\n\\n Across the Hall, the big doors opened just as the last scurrying servants reached their stations.\\n\\n This made no impression on Glenda, lost in thought as she wrestled with the prospect that a leopard might change his shorts. He has been a bit quiet lately, I must admit. And he did write her that lovely poem... That should mean a lot, a poem. Who\u0027d have thought it? It\u0027s not like him at all -\\n\\n With atomic speed Nutt was suddenly missing, and the doors stood wide, and here came the captains with their retinues, and all of them were nervous and some of them were wearing unaccustomed suits, and some of them were walking a little unsteadily even now, because the wizards\u0027 idea of an aperitif had bite, and in the kitchen plates would be being filled and the chefs would be cursing and the ovens clanging as they... as they... What was the menu, anyway?\\n\\n Life as an unseen part of Unseen University was a matter of alliances, feuds, obligations and friendships, all stirred and twisted and woven together.\\n\\n Glenda was good at it. The Night Kitchen had always been generous to other toilers and right now the Great Hall owed her favours, even if all she had done was keep her mouth shut. Now she bore down on Shiny Robert, one of the head waiters, who gave her the cautious nod due to someone who knew things about you that you wouldn\u0027t want your mother to know.\\n\\n \u0027Got a menu?\u0027 she asked. One was produced from under a napkin. She read it in horror.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not the stuff they like!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh dear, Glenda,\u0027 Robert smirked. \u0027Are you saying it\u0027s too good for them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re giving them Avec. Nearly every dish has got Avec in it, but stuff with Avec in the name is an acquired taste. I mean, do these look to you like people who habitually eat in a foreign language? Oh dear, and you are giving them beer! Beer with Avec!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A choice of wines is available. They are choosing beer,\u0027 said Robert coldly.\\n\\n Glenda stared at the captains. They seemed to be enjoying themselves now. Here was free food and drink and if the food tasted strange there was plenty of it, and the beer tasted welcomely familiar and there was lots of that, too.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t like this. Heavens knew that football had got pretty disgusting these days, but... well, she couldn\u0027t quite work out what she was uneasy about, but -\\n\\n \u0027 \u0027scuse me, miss?\u0027\\n\\n She looked down. A young footballer had decided to confide in the only uniformed woman he could see who was not carrying at least two plates at once.\\n\\n \u0027Can I help?\u0027\\n\\n He lowered his voice. \u0027This chutney tastes of fish, miss.\u0027\\n\\n She looked at the other grinning faces around the table. \u0027It\u0027s called caviar, sir. It\u0027ll put lead in your pencil.\u0027\\n\\n The table, as one well-oiled drinker, guffawed, but the youth only looked puzzled. \u0027I haven\u0027t got a pencil, miss.\u0027 More amusement.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s not a lot of them around,\u0027 said Glenda, and left them laughing.\\n\\n \u0027So kind of you to invite me, Mustrum,\u0027 said Lord Vetinari, waving away the hors d\u0027oeuvres. He turned to the wizard on his right. \u0027And the Archchancellor formerly known as Dean is back with you, I see. That is capital.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You may remember that Henry went to Pseudopolis-Brazeneck, you know. He is, er... \u0027 Ridcully slowed.\\n\\n \u0027The new Archchancellor,\u0027 said Vetinari. He picked up a spoon and perused it carefully, as if it were a rare and curious object. \u0027Dear me. I thought that there could be only one Archchancellor. Is this not so? One above all others and one Hat, of course? But these are wizardly matters, of which I know little. So do excuse me if I have misunderstood.\u0027 In the gently turning bowl of the spoon his nose went from long to short. \u0027However, it occurs to me, as an onlooker, that this could lead to a little friction, perhaps.\u0027 The spoon stopped in mid twirl.\\n\\n \u0027A soup\u0026ccedil;on, perhaps,\u0027 said Ridcully, not looking in the direction of Henry.\\n\\n \u0027That much, indeed? But I surmise from the absence of people being turned into frogs that you gentlemen have forgone the traditional option of magical mayhem. Well done. When it comes to the pinch, old friends, united by the bonds of mutual disrespect, cannot bring themselves to actually kill one another. We have hope. Ah, soup.\u0027\\n\\n There was a brief interregnum as the ladle went from bowl to bowl, and then the Patrician said, \u0027Could I assist you? I am without any bias in this matter.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me, my lord, but I think it might be said that you would favour Ankh-Morpork,\u0027 said the Archchancellor formerly known as Dean.\\n\\n \u0027Really? It might also be said that it would be in my interest to weaken the perceived power of this university. You take my meaning? The delicate balance between town and gown, the unseen and the mundane? The twin foci of power. It might be said that I could take the opportunity to embarrass my learned friend.\u0027 He smiled a little smile. \u0027Do you still own the official Archchancellor\u0027s Hat, Mustrum? I notice that you don\u0027t wear it these days and tend to prefer the snazzy number with the rather attractive drawers and the small drinks cabinet in the point.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never liked wearing the official one. It grumbled all the time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It really can talk?\u0027 said Vetinari.\\n\\n \u0027I think the word \"nag\" would be far more accurate, since its only topic of conversation has been how much better things used to be. My only comfort here is that every Archchancellor over the last thousand years has complained about it in exactly the same way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So it can think and speak?\u0027 said Vetinari innocently.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I suppose you could put it like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then you can\u0027t own it, Mustrum: a hat that thinks and speaks cannot be enslaved. No slaves in Ankh-Morpork, Mustrum.\u0027 He waved a finger waggishly.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but it is the look of the thing. What would it look like if I gave up the uniqueness of Archchancellorship without a fight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I really could not say,\u0027 said Lord Vetinari, \u0027but since just about every genuine battle between wizards has hitherto resulted in wholesale destruction, I feel that you would at least look a little embarrassed. And, of course, I will remind you that you were quite happy that Archchancellor Bill Rincewind at Bugarup University cheerfully calls himself Archchancellor.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but he\u0027s a long way away,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027And Fourecks doesn\u0027t really count as anywhere, whereas in Pseudopolis we are talking about a Johnny-come-lately of an organization and its - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027So are we then merely arguing over the question of distance?\u0027 said Vetinari.\\n\\n \u0027No, but - \u0027 said Ridcully and stopped.\\n\\n \u0027Is this worth the argument, I ask you?\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027What we have here, gentlemen, is but a spat between the heads of a venerable and respected institution and an ambitious, relatively inexperienced, and importunate new school of learning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s what we\u0027ve got all right,\u0027 said Ridcully.\\n\\n Vetinari raised a finger. \u0027I hadn\u0027t finished, Archchancellor. Let me see now. I said that what we have here is a spat between an antique and somewhat fossilized, elderly and rather hidebound institution and a college of vibrant newcomers full of fresh and exciting ideas.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here, hang on, you didn\u0027t say that the first time,\u0027 said Ridcully.\\n\\n Vetinari leaned back. \u0027Indeed I did, Archchancellor. Do you not remember our talk about the meaning of words a little while ago? Context is everything. I suggest, therefore, that you allow the head of Brazeneck University the opportunity to wear the official Archchancellor\u0027s Hat for a short time.\u0027\\n\\n You had to pay close attention to what Lord Vetinari said. Sometimes the words, while clearly docile, had a tendency to come back and bite.\\n\\n \u0027Play the football for the Hat,\u0027 said Vetinari.\\n\\n He looked at their faces. \u0027Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Do take a moment to consider this. The importance of the Hat is enhanced. The means by which the wizards strive are not primarily magical. The actual striving and indeed the rivalry will, I think, be good for both universities and people will be interested, whereas in the past when wizards have argued they have had to hide in the cellars. Please do not answer me too quickly, otherwise I will think you have not thought about this enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As a matter of fact, I can think very fast indeed,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027It will simply be no contest. It will be totally unfair.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It certainly will,\u0027 said Henry.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, you both feel that it will be totally unfair,\u0027 said Vetinari.\\n\\n \u0027Indeed. We have a much younger faculty and the brisk and healthy playing fields of Pseudopolis.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Capital,\u0027 said Lord Vetinari. \u0027It seems to me that we have a challenge. University against university. City, as it were, against city. Warfare, as it were, without the tedious necessity of picking up all those heads and limbs afterwards. All things must strive, gentlemen.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose I have to agree,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027It\u0027s not as if I\u0027m going to lose the Hat in any case. I must note, though, Havelock, that you do not allow many challenges to your position.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, but I am challenged very frequently,\u0027 said Lord Vetinari. \u0027It\u0027s just that they don\u0027t win. Incidentally, gentlemen, I did notice in today\u0027s paper that the new voters of Pseudopolis yesterday voted not to have to pay taxes. When you see the president again, please don\u0027t hesitate to tell him that I will be more than happy to advise him when he feels it is necessary. Cheer up, gentlemen. Neither of you has got exactly what you want, but both of you have got exactly what you deserve. If the leopard can change his shorts, a wizard can change his hat. And the leopard must change his shorts, gentlemen, or we are all doomed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you referring to the Loko business?\u0027 said Henry. \u0027You needn\u0027t look surprised.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t intend to. I am surprised,\u0027 said Vetinari, \u0027but please credit me with not looking surprised unless, of course, there is some advantage in doing so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are going to have to do something. The expedition found a nest of the damn things!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Children, which they killed,\u0027 said Vetinari.\\n\\n \u0027Pups that they exterminated!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indeed? And what do you suggest?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are talking about a very evil force here!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Archchancellor, I see evil when I look in my shaving mirror. It is, philosophically, present everywhere in the universe in order, apparently, to highlight the existence of good. I think there is more to this theory, but I tend to burst out laughing at this point. I take it that you are behind the idea of an expeditionary force to Far Uberwald?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course!\u0027 said the former Dean.\\n\\n \u0027It has been tried once before. It was tried twice before that. Why is there a certain cast of the military mind which leads sensible people to do again, with gusto, what didn\u0027t work before?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Force is all they understand. You must know that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Force is all that\u0027s been tried, Archchancellor Henry. Besides, if they are animals, as some people claim, then they understand nothing, but if, as I am convinced, they are sapient creatures, then some understanding is surely required by us.\u0027\\n\\n The Patrician took a sip of his beer. \u0027I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect never will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I\u0027m sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged on to a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature\u0027s wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that\u0027s when I first learned about evil. It is built in to the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.\u0027\\n\\n The two wizards exchanged a glance. Vetinari was staring into the depths of his beer mug and they were glad that they did not know what he saw in there.\\n\\n \u0027Is it me or is it rather dark in here?\u0027 said Henry.\\n\\n \u0027Good heavens, yes! I forgot about the chandelier!\u0027 exclaimed Ridcully. \u0027Where is Mister Nutt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 said Nutt, rather closer than Ridcully would have preferred.\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said I would be ready when you needed me, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What? Oh, yes, of course you did.\u0027 He\u0027s short and polite and amazingly helpful, he told himself. Nothing to worry about at all... \u0027Well, show us how to light the candles, Mister Nutt.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Could I possibly have a fanfare, sir?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I doubt it, young man, but I will bring the Hall to attention.\u0027\\n\\n Ridcully picked up a spoon and tapped the side of a wine glass, in the time-honoured \u0027Look, everybody, I\u0027m trying to make a loud noise very quietly!\u0027 procedure, which has successfully eluded after-dinner speakers ever since the invention of glasses, spoons and dinners.\\n\\n \u0027Gentlemen, pray silence, an expectant one, followed by appreciative applause for the lighting of the chandelier!\u0027\\n\\n There was the silence.\\n\\n As a round of applause was followed by some more silence, people turned around in their chairs for a better view of nothing to see.\\n\\n \u0027Would you please puff on your pipe and hand it to me, sir?\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n Shrugging, Ridcully did so. Nutt took it, raised it in the air and -\\n\\n What happened? It was a topic of conversation for days. Did the red fire come up from the pipe or down from the ceiling or simply out of the walls? All that was certain was that the darkness was suddenly fractured by glowing zigzags that vanished in a blink, leaving a total blackness which cleared like the sky at dawn as all at once every candle, in perfect unison, glowed into life.\\n\\n As the applause began to mount, Ridcully looked along the table at Ponder, who waved his thaumometer, shook his head and shrugged.\\n\\n Then the Archchancellor turned to Nutt, took him out of earshot of the table and for the benefit of watchers shook him by the hand.\\n\\n \u0027Well done, Mister Nutt. Just one thing: that wasn\u0027t magic, because we would know, so how was it done?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, initially, dwarfish alchemy, sir. You know, the kind that works? It is how they light the big chandeliers in the caverns under Bonk. I worked that out by tests and analysis. All the candle wicks are connected by a network of black cotton thread, which terminates in one single thread, which barely shows up in this Hall. You see, the thread is soaked in a formula which burns with extreme but brief ferocity when dry. My slightly altered solution burns considerably faster even than that, consuming the thread until it is nothing but gas. It is quite safe. Only the tips of the candle wicks are treated, you see, and they light as normal. You might be interested, sir, in the fact that the flame travels so fast as to be instantaneous by any human measure. Certainly faster than twenty miles a second, I calculate.\u0027\\n\\n Ridcully was good at looking blank. You couldn\u0027t deal with Vetinari on a regular basis without being able to freeze your expression at will. But, right now, he didn\u0027t have to try.\\n\\n Nutt looked concerned. \u0027Have I failed to achieve worth, sir?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What? Ah. Well.\u0027 Ridcully\u0027s face thawed. \u0027A wonderful effort, Nutt. Well done! Er, how did you get hold of the ingredients?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, there is an old alchemy room in the cellars.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm. Well, thank you again,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027But as Master of this university I must ask you not to talk to anyone about this invention until we have spoken again on the matter. Now, I must get back to the events in hand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you worry, sir, I will see that it does not fall into the wrong hands,\u0027 said Nutt, bustling off.\\n\\n Except, of course, that you are the wrong hands, Ridcully thought, as he returned to the table.\\n\\n \u0027An impressive display,\u0027 said Vetinari, as Ridcully took his seat again. \u0027Am I right in thinking, Mustrum, that the Mister Nutt you referred to is indeed, as it were, the Mister Nutt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right, yes, quite a decent chap.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you\u0027re letting him do alchemy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think it was his own idea, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And he\u0027s been standing here all this time?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very keen. Is there a problem, Havelock?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no, not at all,\u0027 said Vetinari.\\n\\n It was indeed an impressive display, Glenda acknowledged, but while she watched it she could feel Mrs Whitlow\u0027s gaze on her. In theory Glenda\u0027s activities would merit another kind of firework display later on, but it wasn\u0027t going to happen, was it? She had nailed the invisible hammer. But there were other, if less personal, matters on her mind.\\n\\n Stupid, silly, and thoughtless though some of her neighbours were, it was up to her, as ever, to protect their interests. They had been dropped into a world they didn\u0027t understand, so she had to understand it for them. She thought this because as she prowled between the tables she could make out a certain type of clink, clink noise, and, sure enough, the amount of silverware on the tables appeared to be diminishing. After watching carefully for a moment or two, she walked up behind Mr Stollop and without ceremony pulled three silver spoons and a silver fork out of his jacket pocket.\\n\\n He spun around and then had the decency to look a bit embarrassed when he saw that it was her.\\n\\n Glenda didn\u0027t have to open her mouth.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve got so many,\u0027 he protested. \u0027Who needs all those knives and forks?\u0027\\n\\n She reached into the man\u0027s other pocket and pulled out three silver knives and a silver salt cellar.\\n\\n \u0027Well, there\u0027s such a lot,\u0027 said Stollop. \u0027I didn\u0027t think they\u0027d miss one or two.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda stared at him. The clinking of cutlery disappearing from the tables had been a small but noticeable part of the ambient noise for some time. She leaned down until her face was an inch away from his.\\n\\n \u0027Mr Stollop. I wonder if that\u0027s what Lord Vetinari is expecting you all to do.\u0027 His face went white. She nodded. \u0027Just a word to the wise,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n And words spread fast. As Glenda walked on she was gratified to hear behind her, spreading along the tables, more clinking as a tide of cutlery flowed swiftly out of pockets and back on to the tables. The tinkling flew up and down the tables like little fairy bells.\\n\\n Glenda smiled to herself and hurried off to dare everything. Or at least everything that she dared.\\n\\n Lord Vetinari stood up. For some inexplicable reason he needed no fanfare. No \u0027Would you put your hands together for\u0027, no \u0027Lend me your ears\u0027, no \u0027Be upstanding for\u0027. He simply stood up and the noise went down. \u0027Gentlemen, thank you for coming, and may I thank you, Archchancellor Ridcully, for being such a generous host this evening. May I also take this opportunity to put your minds at rest.\\n\\n \u0027You see, there appears to be a rumour going around that I am against the playing of football. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am completely in favour of the traditional game of football and, indeed, would be more than happy to see the game leave the fusty obscurity of the back streets. Moreover, while I know you have your own schedule of games, I personally propose a league, as it were, of senior teams, who will valiantly vie with one another for a golden cup - \u0027\\n\\n There were cheers, of a beery nature.\\n\\n \u0027 - or should I say gold-ish cup - \u0027\\n\\n More cheers and more laughter.\\n\\n \u0027 - based on the recently discovered ancient urn known as The Tackle, which, I am sure, you have all seen?\u0027\\n\\n General sniggering.\\n\\n \u0027And if you haven\u0027t, then your wives certainly have.\u0027\\n\\n Silence, followed by a tsunami of laughter which, like most tidal waves, had a lot of froth on the top.\\n\\n Glenda, lurking among the serving girls, was taken aback and affronted at the same time, which was a bit of a squeeze, and wondered... So, he\u0027s planning something. They\u0027re lapping it up along with the beer, too.\\n\\n \u0027Never seen that before,\u0027 said a wine waiter beside her.\\n\\n \u0027Seen what before?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Seen his lordship drinking. He doesn\u0027t even drink wine.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda looked at the skinny black figure and said, enunciating carefully, \u0027When you say he does not drink wine, do you mean he does not drink wine, or he does not drink... wine?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He doesn\u0027t have a bloody drink. That\u0027s all I\u0027m saying. That\u0027s Lord Vetinari, that is. He\u0027s got ears everywhere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can only see two, but he\u0027s quite handsome, in a way.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-11.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) \\n The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. \\n Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .).
