{"id":94967,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\u0027And if you\u0027re wondering where that dim little girl of yours is, she\u0027s back there with the fat girl. Honestly, what must you think of me?\u0027 \u0027Nothing, right up until you said that,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027And now I do.\u0027 \u0027Give my best to the orc,\u0027 said Andy. \u0027Shame to hear he\u0027s the last one.\u0027 They strolled on, but Trev was quick enough to get out of the way before Mrs Atkinson sliced at his leg with her stick. Find Juliet. Find Nutt. Find Glenda. Find help. Find a ticket to Fourecks. Trev had never fought. Never really fought. Oh, there had been times when he was younger when he was drawn into a bit of a ruck and it was politic to be among the other kids, holding a makeshift weapon in his hands. He\u0027d been so good at appearing to be everywhere, shouting a lot and then running into the thick of the fray, but never actually catching up with the real action. He could go to the Watch and tell them... that Andy had been threatening? Andy was always threatening. When trouble struck in the Shove as it sometimes did, when two tribes were brought into conjunction, there was always the forest of legs to dive between and once, when Trev had been really desperate, a number of shoulders to run across... What was he thinking? He wouldn\u0027t be there. He wasn\u0027t going to play. He\u0027d promised his old mum. Everyone knew he\u0027d promised his old mum. He\u0027d like to play, but his old mum wouldn\u0027t like it. It was as if his old mum had written him a note: Dear Andy, please do not knife Trevor today because he has promised not to play. He blinked away the sensation that a knife was already hurtling towards him and heard the voice of Nutt saying, \u0027Oh, I have heard about Bu-bubble.\u0027 There was Glenda and Juliet and Nutt and Juliet and a slightly worried young lady with a notebook and Juliet. There was also Juliet, but it was hard to even notice her because Juliet was there. \u0027She says she wants to write an article,\u0027 said Glenda, who had clearly waylaid the journalist. \u0027Her name is Miss - \u0027 \u0027Roz,\u0027 said the girl. \u0027Everyone\u0027s talking about you, Mister Nutt. Would you answer a few questions, please? We have a very now audience.\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 he ventured. \u0027How does it feel to be an orc, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027I am not sure. How does it feel to be human?\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Have your experiences as an orc affected the way you will play football?\u0027 \u0027I will only be playing as a substitute. My role is merely that of a trainer. And, I have to say, in answer to your question, I\u0027m not sure I have had many experiences as an orc up until now.\u0027 \u0027But are you advising the players to rip opponents\u0027 heads off?\u0027 the girl giggled. Glenda opened her mouth, but Nutt said solemnly, \u0027No, that would be against the rules.\u0027 \u0027I hear they think you\u0027re a very good trainer. Why do you think this is?\u0027 Despite the patent stupidity of the question, Nutt seemed to think deeply. \u0027One must consider the horizons of possibility,\u0027 he said slowly. \u0027E Pluribus Unum, the many become one, but it could just as easily be said that the one becomes many, Ex uno multi, and indeed, as Von Sliss said in The Effluence of Reality, the one, when carefully considered, may in fact be a many in different clothing.\u0027 Glenda looked at the girl\u0027s face. Her expression hadn\u0027t moved and neither had her pencil. Nutt smiled to himself and continued. \u0027Now let us consider this in the light, as it may be, of the speeding ball. Where it has come from we believe we know, but where it will land is an ever-changing conundrum, even if only considered in four-dimensional space. And there we have the existential puzzle that confronts the striker, for he is both striker and struck. As the ball flies, all possibilities are inexorably linked, as Herr Frugal said in Das Nichts des Wissens, \"Ich kann mich nicht genau erinnern, aber es war so etwas wie eine Vanillehaltige s��sse Nachspeisenbeigabe,\" although I believe he was on some medication at the time. Who is mover and who is moved? Given that the solution can only be arrived at through conceptual manifestation using, I believe, some perception of transfinite space, it can clearly be seen that among the possibilities is that the ball will land everywhere at the same time or turn out never to have been kicked at all. It is my job to reduce this metaphysical overhead, as it were, and to give my lads some acceptable paradigm, such as, it might be, whack it right down the middle, my son, and at least if the goalie stops it you will have given him a hot handful he won\u0027t forget in a hurry. \u0027You see, the thing about football is that it is not about football. It is a most fascinating multi-dimensional philosophy, an extrusion, as it were, of what Doctor Maspinder promulgated in Das Meer von Unvermeidlichkeit. Now, you would say to me, I am sure,\u0027 he went on, \u0027What of the 4�C4�C2 or even the 4�C1�C2�C1�C2, yes? And my answer to that would be, there is only the one. Traditionally we say there are eleven players in the team, but that is because of our rather feeble perceptions. In truth, there is only the one and therefore, I would say,\u0027 he gave a little laugh, \u0027daring to adapt a line from The Doors of Deception: it does not matter whether you win or lose so long as you score the most goals.\u0027 The girl looked down at her notepad. \u0027Could you give that to me a little bit more simply?\u0027 \u0027Oh, I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I thought I had.\u0027 \u0027And I think that\u0027s about enough,\u0027 said Glenda, taking the girl by the arm. \u0027But I haven\u0027t asked him about his favourite spoon,\u0027 she wailed. Nutt cleared his throat. \u0027Well, I would have appreciated some notice of that question because it is quite a large field, but I think the Great Bronze Spoon of Cladh, which weighed more than a ton, would definitely have to be a runner, though we must not forget the set of spoons, each one smaller than a grain of rice, crafted by some unknown genius for the concubines of the Emperor Whezi. But undoubtedly, from what I can gather, these were surpassed by the notorious clockwork spoon, devised by Bloody Stupid Johnson, which could apparently stir coffee so fast that the cup would actually rise up from the saucer and hit the ceiling. Oh, to be a fly on that wall, but not too close, obviously. Possibly less well known is the singing spoon of the learned sage Ly Tin Wheedle, which could entertain the dinner table by singing comic songs. Among other great spoons - \u0027 \u0027That is enough,\u0027 said Glenda, tugging the girl away for her own good. \u0027He\u0027s an orc?\u0027 the girl said. \u0027So everyone says,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Were they all like that? I thought it was all about twisting heads off?\u0027 \u0027Well, I suspect people get bored with the same old thing.\u0027 \u0027But how does he know all about spoons?\u0027 \u0027Believe me, if anyone has ever written Great Spoons of the World, Mister Nutt has read it.\u0027 Trev heard the girl\u0027s plaintive voice as Glenda almost forcibly led her away, or at least away from Nutt. \u0027I really wanted to talk to Jewels,\u0027 Trev heard the girl say, as she walked past Juliet without a glance. \u0027But she\u0027s hiding out, everyone says.\u0027 He hurried across and pulled the other two in a huddle towards him. \u0027There\u0027s gonna be murder tomorrow,\u0027 he said. \u0027The wizards can\u0027t use magic and Ankh-Morpork United is gonna be made up out of the toughest, nastiest bunch of buggers that\u0027re outside of the Tanty.\u0027 \u0027We shall have to change our tactics to suit, then,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Are you nu - insane? I\u0027m talkin\u0027 about people like Andy, Nutt. An\u0027 he might not be the worst one.\u0027 \u0027But everything is a matter of tactics. A respect for strengths and weaknesses and the proper utilization of the knowledge,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Listen!\u0027 said Trev. \u0027There won\u0027t be time for that sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027If I may quote - \u0027 Nutt began. \u0027I said listen! Do you know any quotes by people who have been knifed in the back an\u0027 then kicked in the nu - \u0027 He stopped and then continued. \u0027Kicked when they\u0027re lyin\u0027 on the ground, yes? Because that\u0027s what you need to be thinkin\u0027 about at the moment.\u0027 \u0027The Watch will be there,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027But generally their way of dealing with a complicated event is to get everyone lyin\u0027 on the ground,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027That makes it simpler.\u0027 \u0027I feel certain that we could beat any team at football,\u0027 said Nutt soothingly. Trev looked around him in a desperate search for anyone who might have a grip. \u0027It doesn\u0027t work like that! It\u0027s not about the football!\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think I want to see anyone hurt,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027Then you\u0027ll have to close your eyes,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Nutt, you think that everythin\u0027 is going to be nice and sportsmanlike \u0027cos that\u0027s how the new football has been designed, but it\u0027s the same old people out there. You know what I think?\u0027 \u0027My dad says it won\u0027t look very good for Vetinari if the Academicals lose,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027An\u0027 will he be glad about that?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Well, I suppose, yes, but even Dad says prob\u0027ly better to have bloody Vetinari than most of the buggers we\u0027ve had.\u0027 That was because the city worked, thought Trev. It had been a mess before Vetinari had taken over and no one knew exactly how he\u0027d done it. He\u0027d got the Watch working properly. He\u0027d got the war between the dwarfs and the trolls sorted out. He let people do whatever they liked, provided they did whatever he liked. And above all, the city was crammed with people and money. Everyone wanted to live in Ankh-Morpork. Could he really be shaken down because the new football went bad? Well, the answer was, of course, yes�Cbecause that\u0027s how people were. Trev mentioned this to Glenda as she came back from ushering the bemused Roz out of the range of more of Nutt\u0027s philosophy. She looked at Trev and said, \u0027Do you think Vetinari knows about this?\u0027 \u0027Dunno,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Well, I know he\u0027s s\u0027posed to have lots of spies, but I dunno whether they\u0027d know about this.\u0027 \u0027Do you think someone ought to tell him?\u0027 said Glenda. Trev laughed. \u0027What are you suggestin\u0027? That we go over to the palace, walk right up to him and say, \"Excuse us, mister, there are a few things that have escaped your attention?\"\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Thank you, Drumknott, that will be all for now,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said Drumknott. He nodded at Lady Margolotta and oiled his way noiselessly out of the room. \u0027Havelock, I appreciate that Drumknott is very competent, but he always seems to me to be a rather strange little man.\u0027 \u0027Well, it would be a funny old world if we were all alike, madam, although I admit not very funny if we were all like Drumknott. But he is loyal and excessively trustworthy,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Hmm,\u0027 said her ladyship. \u0027Does he have much of a personal life?\u0027 \u0027I believe that he collects different types of stationery,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027I have sometimes speculated that he might change his life for the better should he meet a young lady willing to dress up as a manila envelope.\u0027 They were on the balcony outside the Oblong Office, which offered a perfect view of the centre of the city while leaving the viewer almost invisible. \u0027The accord is going ahead?\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Certainly,\u0027 said her ladyship. \u0027Peace at last between dwarfs and trolls.\u0027 Vetinari smiled. \u0027The word \"peace\" is generally defined as a period of rest and rearmament before the next war. Were many assassinations necessary?\u0027 \u0027Havelock, sometimes you are too direct!\u0027 \u0027I do beg your pardon, it\u0027s just that the progress of history requires butchers as well as shepherds.\u0027 \u0027There were no assassinations,\u0027 said her ladyship. She turned her eyes upwards. \u0027There was, however, a terrible mining accident and a rather unusual rock slide. But, of course, there is still the Loko business to sort out. The dwarfs still want total extermination.\u0027 \u0027How many orcs are there?\u0027 \u0027Nobody knows. Perhaps Nutt will be able to find them.\u0027 \u0027We must not have genocide,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027History has a way of repaying.\u0027 \u0027He is turning out to be quite a surprise.\u0027 \u0027So I understand. From the reports I have been receiving, all that the orcs were not, he is.\u0027 \u0027But he will remain an orc underneath it all,\u0027 said her ladyship. \u0027I wonder what remains under all of us?\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027You\u0027ve taken a very big risk, you know,\u0027 said Lady Margolotta. \u0027Madam, this city is all risk, I assure you.\u0027 \u0027And power is a game of smoke and mirrors,\u0027 said her ladyship, reaching for the wine. \u0027Oddly enough, Commander Vimes reminds me of that nearly every day. No civil police force could hold out against an irate and resolute population. The trick is not to let them realize that. Yes?\u0027 There was a knock at the door. It was Drumknott again. \u0027I am sorry to interrupt, sir, madam, but in the circumstances I thought it would be a good idea.\u0027 He sniffed. \u0027It\u0027s the lady with the pies.\u0027 \u0027Ah, Miss Sugarbean, legendary inventor of the famous Ploughman\u0027s Pie,\u0027 said Vetinari. He glanced at her ladyship. \u0027And Mister Nutt\u0027s friend.\u0027 \u0027I have met her, Havelock. She harangued me.\u0027 \u0027Yes, she does it very well. You feel as if you\u0027ve had a nice cold bath. Do show her in, Drumknott.\u0027 \u0027And there is a young man with her. I recognize him as Trevor Likely, son of the famous footballer Dave Likely, and I am informed by her that she has indeed brought you a Ploughman\u0027s Pie.\u0027 \u0027You would take untested food from a member of the public?\u0027 said her ladyship, horrified. \u0027Certainly from this one,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027There is no possible way that she would ever put poison in anything. Not out of respect for me, you understand, but out of respect for the food. Don\u0027t leave. I think you will find this... interesting.\u0027 The pie was still warm in Glenda\u0027s hands as she stepped into the Oblong Office. She herself almost froze at the sight of Lady Margolotta, but a certain robustness kicked in. \u0027Do I have to curtsy?\u0027 she said. \u0027Not unless you really feel the need.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve come to warn you,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Indeed.\u0027 Vetinari raised an eyebrow. \u0027Ankh-Morpork United will walk all over Unseen Academicals with great big boots on.\u0027 \u0027Oh, dear. Do you think that will be the case?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re not yer average players!\u0027 Trev blurted out. \u0027They\u0027re from the Shove. They go armed.\u0027 \u0027Ah, yes. Football as warfare,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Well, thank you for telling me.\u0027 Silence fell. Vetinari broke it by saying, \u0027Was there anything else you would like to say?\u0027 He looked at the pie that Glenda was holding out in front of her like some kind of chastity device. \u0027Can\u0027t you do something?\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s a game, Miss Sugarbean. Having suggested the match in the first place, what do you think I would look like if I intervened? There will, after all, be rules. There will, after all, be a referee.\u0027 \u0027They won\u0027t care,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Then I suppose the Watch will have to do its duty. And now, if you will excuse me, I have affairs of state to attend to, but please leave the pie.\u0027 \u0027One moment,\u0027 said her ladyship. \u0027Why have you come to warn his lordship, young lady?\u0027 \u0027Isn\u0027t that the sort of thing I ought to do?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And you walked in, just like that?\u0027 \u0027Well, the pie helped.\u0027 \u0027We have met before, you know,\u0027 said her ladyship. She stared at Glenda and Glenda stared back, and she finally managed, \u0027Yes, I know, and I\u0027m not frightened and I\u0027m not sorry.\u0027 The battle of the stares went on for a year too long and then Lady Margolotta turned her head away sharply and said, \u0027Well, you have got one of them right, but I am sure I shall enjoy the pie and also the match.\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Thank you both for calling, but if you will excuse us we do have matters of state to discuss.\u0027 \u0027Well!\u0027 said Lady Margolotta as the door shut behind them. \u0027What type of people are you incubating in this city of yours, Havelock?\u0027 \u0027I imagine some of the very best,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Two common people can barge in on you without so much as an appointment?\u0027 \u0027But with a pie,\u0027 said Vetinari quickly. \u0027You were expecting them?\u0027 \u0027Let us just say that I was not unduly surprised,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027I certainly know about the make-up of Ankh-Morpork United. So does the Watch.\u0027 \u0027And you are going to let them into an arena with a bunch of old wizards who have promised not to do magic?\u0027 \u0027A bunch of old wizards and Mister Nutt,\u0027 said Vetinari cheerfully. \u0027Apparently he\u0027s very good at tactical planning.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t allow that.\u0027 \u0027This is my city, Margolotta. There are no slaves in Ankh-Morpork.\u0027 \u0027He is my ward. I expect you will ignore that, though.\u0027 \u0027I have every intention of doing so. After all, it\u0027s only a game.\u0027 \u0027But a game is not about games. And what sort of game do you think you will get tomorrow?\u0027 \u0027A war,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027And the thing about war is that it\u0027s about war.\u0027 Lady Margolotta shot out her long sleeve and a fine steel dagger was suddenly in her hand. \u0027I suggest you cut it in half,\u0027 said Vetinari, indicating the pie, \u0027and I will choose which half to pick up.\u0027 \u0027But what if one half has more pickled onions than the other?\u0027 \u0027Then I think that will be open to negotiation. Would you like some more... wine?\u0027 \u0027Did you see that she tried to stare me down?\u0027 said Margolotta. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027I saw that she succeeded.\u0027 When Glenda and Trev got back to the Hippo, Nutt looked at them expectantly. \u0027He hardly listened,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Quite so,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I am confident of our success on the morrow. I am quite certain that we will be tactically supreme.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m just glad I won\u0027t be playin\u0027, that\u0027s all,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Yes, Mister Trev, that really is a great shame.\u0027 From the nearby table where last-minute adjustments were being made by the Football League came the voice of somebody saying, \u0027Nah, nah. Look, you\u0027ve still got it wrong. If a bloke from side B is closer to the goalkeeper�Cno, I tell a lie�Cif he\u0027s closer to the goal than the goalkeeper, then he surely puts one away there and then. Stands to reason.\u0027 There was a sigh that could only have come from Ponder Stibbons. \u0027No, I don\u0027t think you understand... \u0027 Another voice chipped in. \u0027If the goalkeeper is that far out of his goal then he\u0027s a pillock!\u0027 \u0027Look, let\u0027s start again,\u0027 said another voice. \u0027Supposing I\u0027m this bloke here.\u0027 Trev looked across and saw one of the men flick a screwed-up piece of paper across the table. \u0027Like, I\u0027ve kicked the ball that far and this is me, this piece of paper. Then what?\u0027 He flicked the paper once again, which hit Ponder\u0027s pencil. \u0027No! I\u0027ve already explained that. And stop flicking bits of paper around, I find it very confusing.\u0027 \u0027But it must work if he dribbles on it,\u0027 said a voice. \u0027Hold on a minute, though,\u0027 said yet another voice. \u0027What happens, right, if you get the ball in your own half of the field and run all the way, not passing it to anyone else, and get it into the net?\u0027 \u0027That would be perfectly legal,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Yeah, but there\u0027s no way that\u0027s goin\u0027 to happen, is there?\u0027 said the man who had just flicked a soggy piece of paper and had enjoyed it so much that he\u0027d flicked another one. \u0027But if he tries and succeeds it would be magnificent football, would it not?\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Where\u0027s our team?\u0027 said Trev, looking around. \u0027I\u0027ve suggested they have an early night,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027An early night for wizards is two o\u0027clock in the morning,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I have also given instructions that the team are to have a special meal this evening,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027On that note, Miss Glenda, I shall have to ask you to lock the Night Kitchen.\u0027 Stony silence hung over the dining room that evening. \u0027I don\u0027t eat salads,\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs (no relation). \u0027They gives me the wind.\u0027 \u0027How can a man live without pasta?\u0027 said Bengo. \u0027This is barbaric!\u0027 \u0027I hope you notice that my plate is as barren as yours, gentlemen,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Mister Nutt is training us and I\u0027m allowing Mister Nutt the driver\u0027s seat. Nor is there to be any smoking this evening.\u0027 There was a chorus of dismay and he raised his hand for silence. \u0027Also, his instruction here... \u0027 He looked closer at Nutt\u0027s rather untidy writing and gave a little smile. \u0027There is to be no sexual congress.\u0027 This did not meet with the reaction he had expected. \u0027That means talking about it, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. \u0027No, that\u0027s oral sex,\u0027 said Rincewind. \u0027No, that\u0027s listening to it.\u0027 Bengo Macarona sat with a dazed look on his face. \u0027Now, I don\u0027t want any sneaking off for midnight snacks,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027There are rules. Mrs Whitlow and Miss Sugarbean have been told that I fully back Mister Nutt\u0027s authority here. Surely you gentlemen could show some backbone?\u0027 \u0027In an attempt to show solidarity with the rest of the team,\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes, \u0027I am led to believe that there is some cheese in the mousetrap in my room.\u0027 Ridcully was left all alone with only the echo of falling chairs for company. The Archchancellor repaired to his own room and tossed his hat on to its stand. There have to be rules, he said to himself, and there has to be a rule for them and a rule for me. He went to his eight-poster bed and opened the hatch containing the tobacco jar. It now contained a little note instead, saying, \u0027Dear Archchancellor, In accordance with your ratification of Mister Nutt\u0027s instructions that the faculty are not to be allowed food or the implements of smoking this evening, I\u0027ve taken the liberty of clearing away your cigarettes and pipe tobacco. May I also mention that I have emptied the cool cupboard of the usual cold cuts and pickles to avoid temptation.\u0027 \u0027Bugger,\u0027 said Ridcully under his breath. He walked to his wardrobe and rummaged in the pocket of his smoking jacket, coming up with a note that said, \u0027In accordance with Mister Nutt\u0027s rules, as ratified by yourself, Archchancellor [and it was remarkable how reproachful Mrs Whitlow could make her handwriting], I have taken the liberty of removing your emergency peppermints.\u0027 \u0027Change and decay!\u0027 Ridcully declared to the night air. \u0027I am surrounded by traitors! They thwart me at every turn.\u0027 He wandered disconsolately past his bookcase and pulled out Boddrys\u0027 Occult Companion, a book he knew by heart. And because he knew the book by heart, page 14 opened on to a neat little cavity, which contained a packet of extra-strong liquorice mints, an ounce of Jolly Sailor tobacco and a packet of Wizzla\u0027s... And, as it turned out, a small note: \u0027Dear Archchancellor, I just didn\u0027t have the heart. Mrs Whitlow.\u0027 It seemed darker than usual. Generally, the Archchancellor\u0027s rulings were obeyed, and it seemed to the members of Unseen Academicals that every door was closed, indeed slammed, as they searched for food. Every pantry was locked and spell-proofed. The team trudged helplessly from one hall to another. \u0027I do have some reheatable pasta in my room,\u0027 said Bengo Macarona. \u0027My grandmother gave it to me before I came down here. It will keep for ten years and my grandmother says that it will taste as good after ten years as it does now. I regret that she may have been telling the truth.\u0027 \u0027If you get it, we could cook it up in my room,\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes. \u0027If you like. It contains alligator testicles, for nourishment. They are very popular at home.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t know alligators had testicles,\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes. \u0027They haven\u0027t got \u0027em any more,\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs (no relation). \u0027I\u0027ve got a biscuit, we could share that out,\u0027 said Ponder Stibbons. He was immediately pierced by their questioning gazes. \u0027No,\u0027 he said, \u0027I am not going to countermand the Archchancellor\u0027s orders any further than that. I would never hear the last of it, gentlemen. Without a hierarchy we are nothing.\u0027 \u0027The Librarian will have some bananas,\u0027 said Rincewind. \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 said Macarona. \u0027I think the Librarian has a motto in these cases: \"If you try to take my bananas from me, I will reclaim them from your cold dead hands.\"\u0027 Trev, who had been lurking in the shadows, waited until the rumble of stomachs died away in the distance and then hurried back and knocked on the bolted door of the Night Kitchen. \u0027They\u0027ve all met up and they\u0027re headed for the Library.\u0027 \u0027Good, I think he\u0027ll share his bananas with them,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I don\u0027t really see the point,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027The point is they are friends. Partners in adversity. They are a team. That is football. You have to train a team to be a team and I will have no problem with them having a very large breakfast in the morning.\u0027 Nutt was changing, Trev thought. \u0027Can I ask you a personal question, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027Nearly all the questions people ask me are personal, though do go ahead, Mister Trev.\u0027 \u0027Well, er, all right. Sometimes you look big and sometimes you look small. What\u0027s that all about?\u0027 \u0027It is something built into us,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I believe that it is a product of the morphic field contracting and expanding. It affects your perceptions.\u0027 \u0027When you\u0027re upset, you do look very small,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027What size do I look now?\u0027 \u0027Pretty big,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Good,\u0027 said Nutt, helping himself to a slice of pie. \u0027Tomorrow I intend to look even bigger.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s somethin\u0027 else we have to do,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Pepe wants to help me. He thinks I\u0027m gonna play football.\u0027 \u0027Well, you are going to play football,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027No! You know this! I promised my ol\u0027 mum and you can\u0027t break a promise to your ol\u0027 mum, Gods rest her soul. Do you \u0027ave keys to the wine cellar, Glenda?\u0027 \u0027Do you think I\u0027d tell you, Trev Likely?\u0027 \u0027Thought not. I want two bottles of best brandy. And, er, could you all come with me, please? I think Pepe means well, but he, er, well, you know him, it\u0027s midnight and everythin\u0027.\u0027 \u0027I think I know Pepe,\u0027 said Glenda. There was a guard on the rear door of Shatta, but before he could even think of turning away Trev and his bodyguards, Pepe appeared. \u0027Cor! Three chums. I must be very frightening,\u0027 he said, leering. \u0027Hello, chums, got the brandy?\u0027 \u0027Yes, what\u0027s this all about, Pepe? You\u0027ve been putting the willies up Trev,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I never have! I hardly ever put the willies up anyone these days. I just told him he was going to play in the football.\u0027 \u0027I promised my ol\u0027 mum,\u0027 said Trev, clinging to the declaration as if it were a tiny raft in a choppy sea. \u0027But you\u0027ve got a star in your hand and you don\u0027t have much of a choice.\u0027 Trev looked at his palm. \u0027Just a lot of lines.\u0027 \u0027Well there\u0027s them that has the sight and there again there\u0027s them that don\u0027t. I\u0027m one of those that have. \u0027s metaphorical, see. But all it is is that I would like to give you a little something that may be of use to you tomorrow. What am I saying? It might damn well save your life,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027It\u0027ll certainly save your marriage. I\u0027m sure the ladies here would like to think that us at Shatta have done the best for you.\u0027 \u0027For what it\u0027s worth, Trev, I trust Pepe,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And this is Mister Nutt,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027He\u0027s a friend.\u0027 \u0027Yeah. I know what Mister Nutt is,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027And you can come, too. I am pleased to make your... acquaintance.\u0027 He turned to Glenda. \u0027You girls stay here, miss,\u0027 he said. \u0027This is no errand for a lady.\u0027 He ushered the boys into the gloom. \u0027What I\u0027m going to show you gentlemen is top secret and if you cross me, Trev Likely, I will do things that will make Andy Shank look like a playground bully.\u0027 \u0027Andy was a playground bully,\u0027 said Trev, as they reached what was clearly a forge. \u0027Micromail,\u0027 said Pepe with satisfaction. \u0027The world hasn\u0027t seen the half of it yet.\u0027 \u0027It just looks like fine chain mail,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027It\u0027s strange stuff,\u0027 said the dwarf. \u0027I can give you a vest and pair of shorts and they better both come back here, boy, otherwise said implications will be performed on your arse and I ain\u0027t kidding. This stuff isn\u0027t just for making the girls look pretty. You would be amazed what it can do with just a little change in the alloy.\u0027 He pointed to a glistening heap. \u0027It\u0027s as light as a feather and doesn\u0027t chafe, you know.\u0027 \u0027And what else does it do?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll show you in a minute. Slip on a pair of the shorts.\u0027 \u0027Wot, here?\u0027 said Trev. Somehow, Pepe looked like a small demon by the light of the forge. \u0027Ooh, look at Mister Bashful!\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Just pull a pair on over your trousers for now and I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do, I\u0027ll even turn my back while you\u0027re doing that.\u0027 He looked away, fiddling with the tools beside the anvil. \u0027Got \u0027em on?\u0027 he said, after listening to a few minutes of heavy breathing. \u0027Yes, they, er, well, they feel all right.\u0027 \u0027Okay,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Could you just wait \u0027ere one moment.\u0027 He disappeared into the darkness and, after a succession of strange noises, walked back into view, slowly and awkwardly. \u0027What\u0027s that you\u0027re wearin\u0027, Pepe?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027It looks like a mass of cushions to me.\u0027 \u0027Oh, just a bit of protection,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Now if you could just go back a little way, Mister Nutt, and Trev, if you could oblige me by putting your hands on your head, it just helps to get the measurements right.\u0027 He turned his back on them. \u0027Okay, Trevor, are your hands on your head?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, yeah.\u0027 At which point, Pepe spun round and hit him full force in the groin with a twenty-four-pound sledgehammer... Surprisingly, the only effect was to send Pepe crashing into the opposite wall. \u0027Perfect!\u0027 said his voice, muffled by the padding. Morning came, but it seemed to Glenda that there was no night and no day, no work and no play, there was just football, ahead of them all, drawing them together. In the Great Hall the team had a table all to themselves. Servants and wizards side by side, filling up as only Unseen University could. Football owned the day. Nothing was happening that wasn\u0027t about football. There were certainly no lectures. Of course, there never were, but at least today they weren\u0027t being attended because of the excitement about the upcoming match rather than not being attended because no one wanted to go to them. And after a while, Glenda became aware of the sound which was coming from the city itself. There were crowds outside the university; there were crowds, even now, queuing to get into the Hippo. The sound of a hundred thousand people at one purpose rose like the buzz of a distant swarm. Glenda went back to the sanctuary of the Night Kitchen and tried to pass some time by doing some baking, but the dough fell from her fingers. \u0027Are you upset?\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027I hope we\u0027re going to win,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Well, of course we\u0027re going to win,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027That\u0027s all very well up until the time we lose,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Yes, who\u0027s that?\u0027 The door was pushed open and Pepe stepped in, looking smarter than usual. \u0027Hello, ladies,\u0027 he said. \u0027Got a little message for you. How was you expecting to watch the match?\u0027 \u0027Just so long as we can get close,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Tell you what, then,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Madame has got the best seats in the stadium. Nothing underhand, just open and above-board bribery. Shatta has got to be seen out and about, you see? Got to keep micromail in the public eye.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d love to!\u0027 Juliet shouted. And even Glenda found that her automatic, unthinking cynicism was letting her down. \u0027There will be sherry,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Will there be anyone famous there?\u0027 said Juliet. Pepe walked over and prodded her gently in the chest and said, \u0027Yes. You, miss. Everyone wants to see Jewels.\u0027 It seemed as if the clocks turned backwards. All Watch leave had been suspended, but it was hard to see what crime there could be in streets where nobody could move. A flood of humanity, well, mostly humanity, poured towards the stadium, bounced off it and overflowed and backfilled more and more of the city. The game was in the Hippo, the crowd stretched back to Sator Square and eventually the pressure of so many eyeballs on the hands of so many clocks moved time forwards. Only the team, and Trev, remained in the Great Hall, everyone else having left much earlier in a fruitless attempt at securing a seat. They milled around aimlessly prodding the ball to one another until Ponder, Nutt and the Archchancellor turned up. \u0027Well, big day, lads!\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Looks like there\u0027s going to be a nice day for it as well. They\u0027re all over there waiting for us to give them a show. I want you to approach this in the best traditions of Unseen University sportsmanship, which is to cheat whenever you are unobserved, though I fear that the chance of anyone being unobserved today is remote. But in any case, I want you all to give it one hundred and ten per cent.\u0027 \u0027Excuse me, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder Stibbons. \u0027I understand the sense of what you are saying, but there is only one hundred per cent.\u0027 \u0027Well, they could give it one hundred and ten per cent if they tried harder,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Well, yes and no, sir. But, in fact, that would mean that you had just made the one hundred per cent bigger while it would still be one hundred per cent. Besides, there is only so fast a man can run, only so high a man can jump. I just wanted to make the point.\u0027 \u0027Good point, well made,\u0027 said Ridcully, dismissing it instantly. He looked around at the faces. \u0027Ah, Mister Likely, I suppose there is nothing I can do that would get you on to the team? Dave Likely\u0027s boy playing for Unseen Academicals would be a bit of a feather in our cap. And I see my colleague Professor Rincewind has humorously already put a white one in his.\u0027 \u0027Well, sir, you know how I\u0027m fixed,\u0027 Trev mumbled. \u0027Your old mum,\u0027 said Ridcully, nodding understandingly. \u0027I promised her,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I know she\u0027s passed away, but I\u0027m certain that she still watches over me, sir.\u0027 \u0027Well, that\u0027s nice and does you credit. Is there anything else that can be said? Let me think. Oh yes, gentlemen�CMrs Whitlow, as is her wont on these occasions, has organized her maids to dress up in appropriate costume and cheer us on from the sidelines.\u0027 His face was a blank mask as he continued. \u0027Mrs Whitlow unaccountably takes an enthusiastic and uncharacteristically athletic part in these things. There will be high kicking, I am told, but if you are careful where you let your gaze fall, you should see nothing that will upset you too much.\u0027 \u0027Excuse me, sir,\u0027 said Rincewind. \u0027Is it true that some of the men in Ankh-Morpork United are just a bunch of thugs from the Shove?\u0027 \u0027That might be a bit harsh,\u0027 Ridcully began. \u0027Excuse me, sir,\u0027 said Trev, \u0027that is quite true. I would say about half of them are honest cloggers and the rest of them are bastards.\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027m sure we will overcome,\u0027 said Ridcully jovially. \u0027I would also like to make a few comments before we leave, sir,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027A few words of advice, perhaps? In these few days I have taught you everything I know, even if I do not know how I know it. As you know, I am an orc and whatever else we were, we were team players. You are playing, therefore, not as individuals, but as a team. I think it was Von Haudenbrau who said - \u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve got very much time to get through the crowds,\u0027 said Ridcully, who had been expecting this. \u0027Thank you, Mister Nutt, but I really think we ought to get going.\u0027 Those watching from above would have seen the cramped streets of the city waver as the red caterpillar that was the Unseen Academicals made its way to the ground. There were cheers and there were boos and because this was Ankh-Morpork, usually the cheers and the booing were done alternately by everyone concerned.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-17.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about football—the most important thing about football—is that it is never just about football.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
