{"id":94963,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\u0027Keep quiet about it. Don\u0027t go home. Buy yourself lots of new stuff. Get yourself sorted out and then go back and see your dad and everybody when you have. The point is, even if you don\u0027t go right away, in your mind you should always be going. But the important thing is to go right now. Move out. Get on. Climb up. All the things I should have done.\u0027 \u0027What about Trev?\u0027 said Juliet. Glenda had to think about that. \u0027How are things with you and Trev, then? I saw you two talking last night.\u0027 \u0027Talking is allowed,\u0027 said Juliet defensively. \u0027Anyhow, he was only telling me how he was going to get himself a better job.\u0027 \u0027Doing what?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I\u0027ve never seen him doing a straight day\u0027s work in all the years I\u0027ve known him.\u0027 \u0027He says he\u0027s going to find something,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027He said Nutt told \u0027im to. He said Nutt said that when Trev finds out who Trev is, like, he will, like, know what he can do. So I told \u0027im he was Trevor Likely, and he said that was, you know, helpful.\u0027 I\u0027m stuck, aren\u0027t I? Glenda told herself. I\u0027m talking about changing and getting out, so I have to allow that maybe he\u0027s going to, too. Aloud, she said, \u0027It\u0027s up to you. It\u0027s all up to you, but just mind that he keeps his hands to himself.\u0027 \u0027He always keeps his hands to himself,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027It\u0027s a bit worryin\u0027. I\u0027ve never had to think about kneeing him in the tonker, not once.\u0027 There was a strangled laugh from Pepe, who had just discovered the wow-wow sauce. The bottle was almost empty and, in theory, he should have no stomach left. \u0027Never, ever?\u0027 said Glenda, mystified at this unnatural history. \u0027No, he\u0027s always very polite and just a bit sad.\u0027 That must mean he\u0027s planning something, Glenda\u0027s inner self provided. She said, \u0027Well, it\u0027s up to you. I can\u0027t help here, but remember, you\u0027ve always got your knee.\u0027 \u0027And what about... ?\u0027 Juliet began. \u0027Look,\u0027 said Glenda firmly, \u0027either you go off now and see the world and earn lots of money and get your picture in the papers and all of the other things I know you would really like to do, or you have to sort it out for yourself.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re going to be here for some time,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027You know, this sauce would be nice with a little bit of vodka in it. It really would give it a little bit of zest. A little bit of sparkle. Come to think of it, a lot of vodka would be even better.\u0027 \u0027But I love \u0027im!\u0027 Juliet wailed. \u0027That\u0027s all right, then, stay here,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Have you even kissed?\u0027 \u0027No! He never quite gets round to it.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps he\u0027s one of those gentlemen who don\u0027t like the ladies,\u0027 said Pepe primly. \u0027And we could really do without your input,\u0027 snapped Glenda, turning on him. \u0027I mean, for some of the others, like Rotten Johnny, I nearly wear my knee out, but Trev\u0027s just... sweet, all the time.\u0027 \u0027Look, I know you told me to keep out of this, and I know I\u0027ve been a terrible sinner in my time and hope to remain so, but I have been around the houses more times than a postman and the reason for this imp ass is obvious,\u0027 Pepe volunteered. \u0027He\u0027s got the nous to see that she\u0027s so beautiful that she should be painted standing on some shell somewhere without her vest on and little fat pink babies inexplicably zooming around all over the place and he\u0027s some kid with nothing more than a bit of street smarts. I mean, it\u0027s pointless, isn\u0027t it? He\u0027s not going to stand a chance and he knows it, even if he doesn\u0027t know he knows it.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d give him a kiss if he wanted one and would definitely not knee him in the tonker,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027You have to sort it out,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I can\u0027t sort it out for you. If I tried, it would get sorted out all wrong.\u0027 \u0027But - \u0027 Juliet began. \u0027No, that\u0027s it,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Off you go, buy yourself lots of nice stuff�Cit\u0027s your money. And if you don\u0027t look after her, Mister Pepe, a knee would only be the start.\u0027 Pepe nodded and very gently tugged Juliet away and down the stone steps. Now what would I do at this point if I were in a romantic novel? Glenda said to herself as the footsteps died away. Her reading had left her pretty much an expert on what to do if you were in a romantic novel, although one of the things that really annoyed her about romantic novels, as she had confided to Mr Wobble, was that no one did any cooking in them. After all, cooking was important. Would it hurt to have a pie-making sequence? Would a novel called Pride and Buns be totally out of the question? Even a few tips on how to make fairy cakes would help, and be pretty much in period as well. She\u0027d be a little happier if, even, the lovers could be thrown into the mixing bowl of life. At least it would be some acknowledgement that people actually ate food. Around about now she knew, and knew all through her body, that she should be dissolving into a flood of tears. She started cleaning up the floor. Then she cleaned up the ovens. She always left them sparkling, but that was no reason not to clean them again. She used an old toothbrush to ease minute amounts of dirt from odd corners, scoured every pot with fine sand, emptied the grates, riddled the cinders, swept the floor, tied two brooms together to dislodge the spider\u0027s webs of years from the high wall, and scrubbed again until the soapy water poured down the stone stairs and washed away the footprints. Oh, yes�Cand one other thing. There were some anchovies on the freezing slab. She warmed up a couple and went to the large three-legged cauldron in the corner of the kitchen where last night she had chalked the words \u0027Do Not Touch\u0027. She took off the lid and peered into its depths. The crab that Verity Pushpram had given her last night, which seemed a very long time ago now, waved its eyeballs at her. \u0027I wonder what would have happened if I had left the lid off?\u0027 she said. \u0027I wonder how fast crabs learn?\u0027 She dropped in the soggy anchovies, which seemed to meet with crabby approval. With that done, she stood in the middle of the kitchen and looked for something else to clean. The black iron would never shine, but every surface had been scrubbed and dried. As for the plates, you could eat your dinner off them. If you wanted a job done properly, you had to do it yourself. Juliet\u0027s version of cleanliness was next to godliness, which was to say it was erratic, past all understanding and was seldom seen. Something brushed against her face. She absent-mindedly swiped at it and found her fingers holding a black feather. Those wretched things in the pipes. Someone ought to do something about them. She took her longest broom and banged on a pipe. \u0027Go on! Get out of there!\u0027 she yelled. There was a scuffling in the darkness and a faint \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027 \u0027 \u0027scuse me, miss,\u0027 said a voice, and she looked down the steps into the misshapen face of... What was his name? Oh, yes. \u0027Good morning, Mister Concrete,\u0027 she said to the troll. She couldn\u0027t help but notice the brown stains coming from his nose. \u0027Can\u0027t find Mister Trev,\u0027 Concrete stated. \u0027Haven\u0027t seen him all morning,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Can\u0027t find Mister Trev,\u0027 the troll repeated, louder. \u0027Why do you need him?\u0027 said Glenda. As far as she knew, the vats just about ran themselves. You told Concrete to dribble candles and he dribbled candles until he\u0027d run out of candles. \u0027Mister Nutt sick,\u0027 said Concrete. \u0027Can\u0027t find Mister Trev.\u0027 \u0027Take me to Mister Nutt right now!\u0027 said Glenda. It\u0027s a bit harsh to call anybody a denizen, but the people who lived and worked in the candle vats fitted the word to a T. The vats were, in fact, their den. If you ever saw them anywhere in the underground maze, they were always scuttling very fast, but most of the time they just worked and slept and stayed alive. Nutt was lying on an old mattress with his arms wrapped tightly around himself. Glenda took one look and turned to the troll. \u0027Go and find Mister Trev,\u0027 she said. \u0027Can\u0027t find Mister Trev,\u0027 said the troll. \u0027Keep on looking!\u0027 She knelt down beside Nutt. His eyes had rolled back inside his head. \u0027Mister Nutt, can you hear me?\u0027 He seemed to wake. \u0027You must go away,\u0027 he said. \u0027It will be very dangerous. The door will open.\u0027 \u0027What door is that?\u0027 she said, trying to remain cheerful. She looked at the denizens, who were watching her with a kind of meek horror. \u0027Can\u0027t one of you find something to put over him?\u0027 The mere question sent them scurrying in panic. \u0027I have seen the door, so it will open again,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I can\u0027t see any door, Mister Nutt,\u0027 said Glenda, looking around. Nutt\u0027s eyes opened wide. \u0027It\u0027s in my head.\u0027 There was no privacy to the vats; it was just a wider room off the long, endless corridor. People went past all the time. \u0027I think you may have been overdoing it, Mister Nutt,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You rush around working all hours, worrying yourself sick. You need a rest.\u0027 To her surprise, one of the denizens turned up holding a blanket, quite large parts of which were still flexible. She put it over him just as Trev arrived. He had no choice about arriving as Concrete was dragging him by the collar. He looked down at Nutt and then up at Glenda. \u0027What\u0027s happened to him?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 She raised a finger to her head and swivelled it a little, the universal symbol for \u0027gone nuts\u0027. \u0027You must go away. Things will be very dangerous,\u0027 Nutt moaned. \u0027Please tell us what is going on,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Please tell me.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I cannot say the words.\u0027 \u0027There are words you want to say?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Words that don\u0027t want to be said. Strong words.\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t we help?\u0027 Glenda persevered. \u0027Are you sick?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027No, Mister Trev. I passed an adequate bowel motion this morning.\u0027 That was a flash of the old Nutt-precise, but slightly odd. \u0027Sick in the head?\u0027 said Glenda. That came out of desperation. \u0027Yes. In the head,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Shadows. Doors. Can\u0027t tell you.\u0027 \u0027Is there anyone who can cure that kind of sickness?\u0027 Nutt didn\u0027t answer for a while and then said, \u0027Yes. You must find me a philosopher trained in Uberwald. They will help the thoughts come straight.\u0027 \u0027Isn\u0027t that what you did for Trev?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You told him what he was thinking about his dad and everything, and that made him a lot happier, didn\u0027t it, Trev?\u0027 \u0027Yes, it did,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027And there\u0027s no need to elbow me in the ribs like that. It really did help. Couldn\u0027t you be hypnotized?\u0027 he said to Nutt. \u0027I saw a man in the music hall once and he just waved his shiny watch at them and it\u0027s amazing the kind of things they did. Barked like dogs, even.\u0027 \u0027Yes. Hypnosis is an important part of the philosophy,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027It helps to relax the patient so that the thoughts get a chance to be heard.\u0027 \u0027Well, there you are, then,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Why not try doing it on yourself? I\u0027m sure I could find something shiny for you to wave.\u0027 Trev pulled his beloved tin can out of his pocket. \u0027Tra-la. And I think I\u0027ve got a piece of string here somewhere.\u0027 \u0027That is all very well, but I would not be able to ask myself the right kinds of questions because I will have been hypnotized. How the questions are posed is very important,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I know what,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I\u0027ll tell you to ask yourself to ask the right questions. You\u0027d know what questions to ask if it was someone else, wouldn\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Mister Trev.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t need to hypnotize Trev,\u0027 Glenda pointed out. \u0027No, but his thoughts were close to the surface. I fear that mine will not be so easy to access.\u0027 \u0027Can you really be hypnotized to ask yourself the right questions?\u0027 \u0027In The Doors of Deception, Fussbinder did report on a way of hypnotizing himself,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027It is conceivably possible... \u0027 His voice trailed off. \u0027Then let\u0027s get on with it,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Better out than in, as my old granny used to say.\u0027 \u0027I think perhaps that it is not such a good idea.\u0027 \u0027Didn\u0027t do me any harm,\u0027 said Trev robustly. \u0027The things that I do not know... The things that I do not know... \u0027 muttered Nutt. \u0027What about them?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027The things that I do not know... \u0027 said Nutt, \u0027I think are behind the door, because I think I put them there because I think I do not want to know them.\u0027 \u0027So you must know what it is you don\u0027t want to know?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Well, how bad could it be?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Perhaps it is very bad,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027What would you say if it was me?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I want the truth, now.\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 said Nutt, stuttering slightly, \u0027I think I would say that you should look behind the door to face the things that you do not want to know so we may confront them together. That would certainly be the advice of Von Kladpoll in Doppelte Ber��hrungssempfindung. Indeed, doing so would almost be a fundamental part of the analysis of the hidden mind.\u0027 \u0027Well then,\u0027 said Glenda, standing back. \u0027But what sort of bad things could possibly be in your head, Miss Glenda?\u0027 said Nutt, managing gallantry even in the fetid circumstances of the vats. \u0027Oh, there\u0027s a few,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You don\u0027t go through life without picking up a few.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve had dreams in the night,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Oh, well, everyone has bad dreams,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027These were more than dreams,\u0027 said Nutt. He unfolded his arms and held up a hand. Trev whistled. Glenda said, \u0027Oh,\u0027 and then, \u0027Should they be like that?\u0027 \u0027I have no idea,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Do they hurt?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Well, maybe that sort of thing \u0027appens when goblins get a bit older,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Yes, perhaps they need claws,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Yesterday was wonderful,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I was part of the team. The team were around me. I was happy. And now... \u0027 Trev held up a piece of grubby string and the battered but shiny tin can. \u0027Perhaps you should find out?\u0027 \u0027I might be getting all this wrong,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027but if you don\u0027t want to know what the things are that you don\u0027t want to know, then that means that there are going to be even more things that you don\u0027t want to know and I imagine that sooner or later, if that goes on, your head will cave in around the hole.\u0027 \u0027There is something in what both of you say,\u0027 said Nutt reluctantly. \u0027Then give me a hand to put him on the couch,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Should he be covered in sweat like that?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I would be happier if you chained me down,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027What? Why do you think we should do that?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I think you should beware. Some things leak around the door. They may be bad.\u0027 Glenda looked at the claws. They were a shiny black and, in their way, quite neat, but it was hard to imagine them being used for, say, painting a picture or cooking an omelette. They were claws, and claws were for clawing, weren\u0027t they? But this was Mr Nutt. Even with claws it was still Mr Nutt. \u0027Shall we get started?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I insist on the chains,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027There are all sorts of metal things in the old storeroom four doors down. I saw chains there. Please hurry.\u0027 Automatically Glenda looked down at the claws and saw they had grown longer. \u0027Yes, Trev, please hurry.\u0027 Trev followed her gaze and said brightly, \u0027I\u0027ll be back before you know I\u0027ve gone.\u0027 In fact, it was less than a couple of minutes, and she could hear the clanking as he dragged them all the way down the passageway. Glenda was fighting tears at the simple strangeness of the whole business. Nutt lay there, looking at the ceiling, as they lifted him on to the couch and carefully wrapped the chains around him. \u0027There\u0027s padlocks, but there\u0027s no keys. I can close them, but I can\u0027t open them.\u0027 \u0027Close them,\u0027 said Nutt. Glenda had very seldom cried, and she was trying not to now. \u0027I don\u0027t think we should be doing this,\u0027 she said. \u0027Not here in the vats. People are watching.\u0027 \u0027Please swing your pendulum, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt. Trev shrugged and did so. \u0027Now you have to start telling me that I am feeling sleepy, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt. Trev cleared his throat and swung the shiny can back and forth. \u0027You are definitely feelin\u0027 sleepy. Extremely sleepy.\u0027 \u0027That is good. I am feeling enormously sleepy,\u0027 said Nutt wearily. \u0027And now you must ask me to analyse myself.\u0027 \u0027What does that mean?\u0027 said Glenda sharply, always on the lookout for dangerous words. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I mean, help me examine in detail the workings of my own mind by means of question and answer.\u0027 \u0027But I don\u0027t know the questions to ask,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I do,\u0027 said Nutt patiently, \u0027but you must instruct me to do it.\u0027 Trev shrugged. \u0027Mister Nutt, you must find out what is wrong with Mister Nutt,\u0027 he said. \u0027Ah yes,\u0027 said Nutt, his tone of voice changing slightly. \u0027Are ve comfortable, Mister Nutt? Yes, thank you. The chains hardly chafe at all. Verrry good. Now, tell me about your mother, Mister Nutt. I am familiar with the concept, but I never had a mother as I recall. Thank you for asking anyway,\u0027 said Nutt. And so the monological dialogue began. The other two sat on the stone steps as the quiet voice unravelled itself until: \u0027Ah yes, ze library. Is zere something in ze library, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027There are many books in the library.\u0027 \u0027What else is in ze library, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027There are many chairs and ladders in the library.\u0027 \u0027And what is in ze library zat you do not want to tell me about, Mister Nutt?\u0027 They waited. At last, the voice said, \u0027There\u0027s a cupboard in the library.\u0027 \u0027Is zere anything special about zis cupboard, Mister Nutt?\u0027 Another pause, another faint little voice: \u0027I must not open the cupboard.\u0027 \u0027Why is half of him talking like someone from Uberwald?\u0027 said Glenda to Trev, forgetting the notoriously acute sense of hearing. \u0027Questions asked in a mild Uberwaldian accent in examinations of zis nature appear to put ze patient more at ease,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027And now I would be pleased if you would not make wiz ze interruptions.\u0027 \u0027Sorry,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Don\u0027t mention it. So, why must you not open ze cupboard, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027Because I promised Ladyship that I would not open the cupboard.\u0027 \u0027And did you open ze cupboard, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027I promised Ladyship that I would not open the cupboard.\u0027 \u0027And did you open ze cupboard, Mister Nutt?\u0027 A much longer pause this time. \u0027I promised Ladyship that I would not open the cupboard.\u0027 \u0027Did you learn many things in ze castle, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027Many things.\u0027 \u0027Did you learn how to make ze lockpicks, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Where is ze door now, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027It is in front of me.\u0027 \u0027You opened ze door, Mister Nutt. You think you did not, but you did. And now it is very important zat you open ze door again.\u0027 \u0027But what is inside the door is wrong!\u0027 The two eavesdroppers craned to hear. \u0027Nothing is wronk. Nothing is wronk at all. In ze past, you opened ze door in the foolishness of chilthood. Now, to understand ze door, you must open it with ze wisdom of ze adult. Open ze door, Mister Nutt, and I will walk with you to it.\u0027 \u0027But I no longer have the lockpick.\u0027 \u0027Nature will provide, Mister Nutt.\u0027 Glenda shivered. It had to be her imagination, but they didn\u0027t seem to be in the candle vats any more. A corridor stretched in front of Nutt. He felt everything drop away from him. Chains, clothes, flesh, thoughts. All there was was the corridor and, drifting gently towards him, the cupboard. It was glass-fronted. Light glinted off the bevelled edges. He raised a hand and extended the claw. It cut through wood and glass as if they were air. There was one shelf in the cupboard and one book on the shelf. There was a title on it in silver and chains around it in steel. These were much easier to break through than last time as well. He sat down on a chair that had not been there until he sat down and he began to read the book. The book was called ORC. When the scream came, it didn\u0027t come from Nutt, but from overhead in the tangle of pipes. A skinny woman in a long black robe, perhaps a witch, Glenda thought, shocked by the suddenness, dropped down on to the flagstones and looked around like a cat. No, more like a bird, Glenda thought. Jerky. And then it opened its mouth and screamed: \u0027Awk! Awk! Danger! Danger! Beware! Beware!\u0027 It made a lunge towards the couch, but Trev stepped in the way. \u0027Foolish! The orc will eat your eyes!\u0027 And now this was a duet, because another of the creatures had slid down out of the gloom on what might have been a billowing cloak, or might have been wings. They never stopped moving, each in a different direction, trying to get closer to the couch. \u0027Do not be afraaaid,\u0027 squawked one of them, \u0027we are on your siiide. We are here to protect you.\u0027 Glenda, trembling in shock, managed to stand up. She folded her arms. She always felt better like that. \u0027Who do you think you are�Cdropping out of the ceiling and shouting at people? And you\u0027re shedding feathers. That\u0027s disgusting. This is a - this is quite near a food-preparation area.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, push off,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027That\u0027s telling them,\u0027 said Glenda out of the corner of her mouth. \u0027I bet that took a lot of thinking.\u0027 \u0027You do not understand,\u0027 said a creature. The faces really were strange, as if someone had made a bird out of a woman. \u0027You are in great danger! Awk!\u0027 \u0027From you?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027From the orc,\u0027 said the creature. And the word was a scream. \u0027Awk!\u0027 In the shadows in front of the open cupboard the soul of Nutt turned a page. He felt someone at his elbow and looked up into the face of Ladyship. \u0027Why did you tell me not to open the book, Ladyship?\u0027 \u0027Because I wanted you to read it,\u0027 said her voice. \u0027You had to find the truth for yourself. That is how we all find the truth.\u0027 \u0027And if the truth is terrible?\u0027 \u0027I think you know the answer to that one, Nutt,\u0027 said the voice of Ladyship. \u0027The answer is that, terrible or not, it is still the truth,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027And then?\u0027 said her voice, like a teacher encouraging a promising pupil. \u0027And then the truth can be changed,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Mister Nutt is a goblin,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Yeah, right,\u0027 said the creature. And the phrase seemed incredibly exotic for someone whose face was looking more birdlike all the time. \u0027If I scream, a lot of people will come running,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And what will they do?\u0027 said the creature. And what would they do? Glenda thought. They would stand around saying \u0027What\u0027s all this then?\u0027 and asking all the same questions we are. She shuffled again as one of the things tried to get to the couch. \u0027The orc will kill,\u0027 said a third voice, and another of the things dropped down almost in front of Glenda\u0027s face. Its breath was like carrion. \u0027Mister Nutt is kind and gentle and has never hurt anyone,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Who didn\u0027t deserve it,\u0027 said Trev hurriedly. \u0027But now the orc knows it is an orc,\u0027 said a creature. And now they were milling backwards and forwards in a ghastly pavane. \u0027I don\u0027t think you\u0027re allowed to touch us,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I really don\u0027t think you can touch us.\u0027 He sat down suddenly beside the recumbent Nutt and dragged Glenda down next to him. \u0027I think you \u0027ave to obey rules,\u0027 said Trev. The moving figures stopped instantly. That was somehow creepier than their movement. They stood there as frozen as statues. \u0027They\u0027ve got talons,\u0027 said Glenda, quietly. \u0027I can see their talons.\u0027 \u0027Pounces,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027What\u0027re you talking about?\u0027 \u0027Those big claws are called pounces. The ones at the back are called talons�Cthe ones they carry the prey off with. Everyone gets that wrong.\u0027 \u0027Except you,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You\u0027re like the big expert on horrible birdlike creatures all of a sudden.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t help it. Sometimes you just pick stuff up,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027We must protect you,\u0027 said one of the females. \u0027We don\u0027t need protecting from Mister Nutt! He\u0027s our friend,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And how many of your friends have claws?\u0027 \u0027What have we got to worry about here, in Unseen University, which has got great big thick walls and is pretty much generally crawling with wizards?\u0027 One of the women stretched her neck until her face was a few inches from Trev\u0027s. \u0027There is an orc in here with you.\u0027 There was a clink of chain. Nutt had moved slightly. \u0027You work for somebody, don\u0027t you?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027You\u0027ve got tiny little heads. You can\u0027t \u0027ave enough brains to think this up for yourself. Do the wizards know you\u0027re here?\u0027 Glenda screamed. She had never screamed before, not in a proper way, straight up from the bottom of her terror. Cutting her finger while using the knife carelessly didn\u0027t count and almost certainly would never have been so loud. The scream echoed along the passages, bounced into the cellars and made the undercrofts ring. Glenda screamed a second time and, as her lungs had got into practice, she managed to make this one even louder. There were hurrying footsteps from both directions. That was reassuring. She was not certain how reassuring was the little clink and sliding of metal that suggested a chain had broken. The creatures went into an instant panic, trying to take wing at once. They were as clumsy as herons and got in one another\u0027s way. \u0027And don\u0027t come back!\u0027 she yelled as they disappeared back into the dark. Then she turned to Trev, her heart thumping, and said, \u0027What is an orc?\u0027 \u0027I dunno. I think it\u0027s some kind of old bogey man,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027And what were those things?\u0027 \u0027I know it sounds silly,\u0027 said Trev, \u0027but we saw one of them the other night, and he seems to think they\u0027re, like... friends.\u0027 Butchers, bakers, butlers and bledlows came hurrying out of the dark corridors and one of them was Bledlow Nobbs (no relation), who was inexplicably wearing just his official hat, a string vest and a pair of shorts, far too short and far too tight for a man the size of Bledlow Nobbs (no relation). He looked at Glenda and then glared at Trev. People like Trev were, as far as Bledlow Nobbs (no relation) was concerned, an automatic enemy. \u0027Did you scream? What\u0027s been going on?\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I made an improper suggestion,\u0027 Trev said. He looked at Glenda, his expression saying, \u0027Help me out here.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m afraid I let my girlish modesty get the better of me,\u0027 she said, cursing him with her eyes. \u0027It must have been a pretty strange suggestion,\u0027 said a baker, who seemed to think that an extremely long loaf would have been a suitable aid to combat, but he was grinning�Cand grinning was good. If this ends up with no more than sniggering and grinning then we\u0027ll all be happy, Glenda thought. Hard to live down afterwards, but still good. \u0027But what\u0027s that bloke chained to that bed for?\u0027 said the bledlow. \u0027Yeah, what kind of improper suggestions go on around here?\u0027 said the baker. He really was having fun. I am going to kill someone before the end of all this and it might just have to be myself, thought Glenda. \u0027Isn\u0027t that Mister Nutt?\u0027 said the bledlow. \u0027We\u0027re supposed to be in training in five minutes.\u0027 There was another clink behind Glenda and Nutt\u0027s voice said, \u0027Don\u0027t worry, Alphonse, I often do this trick. Dynamic tension you know, helps build up the muscles.\u0027 \u0027Alphonse?\u0027 said the baker, looking incredulously at the bledlow. \u0027I thought your name was Alfred, Alf for short. Alphonse is a Quirmian name if ever I\u0027ve heard one. You\u0027re not from there, are you?\u0027 That was an accusation as much as a question. \u0027What\u0027s wrong with Alf being short for Alphonse?\u0027 said the bledlow. He had very large hands that might have troubled even Mustrum Ridcully in a game of pat-a-cake. Also, his ears were going red, never a good sign in a man of his size. \u0027Oh, I never said it wasn\u0027t a nice name,\u0027 said the baker, belatedly using his loaf. \u0027But I would never have figured you for an Alphonse. It just goes to show that you never can tell.\u0027 \u0027I am an orc,\u0027 said Nutt quietly. \u0027Actually, Alphonse is quite a nice name,\u0027 the baker went on. \u0027The phonse spoils it a bit, but the Alf I quite like.\u0027 He paused and turned to Nutt. \u0027What do you mean, \"orc\"?\u0027 \u0027An orc,\u0027 said Nutt again. And away in the distant central heating pipes there was a scream of \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be daft, there\u0027s no such thing as orcs any more. They all got killed off hundreds of years ago. Bloody hard to kill, too, I read somewhere,\u0027 said a butler. \u0027In the latter part of your statement you are substantially correct,\u0027 said Nutt, still chained to the couch. \u0027However, nevertheless, I am an orc.\u0027 Glenda looked down. \u0027You told me you\u0027re a goblin, Mister Nutt. You told me you\u0027re a goblin.\u0027 \u0027I was misinformed,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I know I am an orc. I think I have always known that I am an orc. I have opened the door and read the book and I know the truth of my soul and I am an orc, and for some reason I am an orc with a terrible urge to smoke a cigar.\u0027 \u0027But they were like these big horrible monsters that wouldn\u0027t stop fighting and were quite happy to tear off their own arm to use as a weapon,\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs (no relation). \u0027There was an article about them in Bows \u0026 Ammo.\u0027 Every eye turned to Nutt\u0027s arms. \u0027Certainly that is the judgement of history,\u0027 said Nutt. He looked up at Glenda. \u0027I am so sorry,\u0027 he said. \u0027I disobeyed, everybody does it, you see. Schnouzentintle says as much in his book The Obedience of Disobedience. So I wondered what was in the cupboard. And I already had some expertise with lockpicks. I opened the cupboard, I read the book and... \u0027His chains clinked as he shifted position. \u0027I disobeyed. I think everybody does it. We are very good at hiding from ourselves what we do not want to know. Believe me; I was very good at keeping that from myself. But it leaks out, you see, in dreams and things when you have dropped your guard. I am an orc. There is no doubt about that.\u0027 \u0027Okay, right, if you are an orc, right, then why are you not tearing my head off?\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs (no relation). \u0027Would you like me to?\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Well, as it happens, no!\u0027 \u0027Who cares?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027It\u0027s all ancient history anyway. These days you see vampires hangin\u0027 around all over the place. An\u0027 we\u0027ve got trolls and golems and zombies and all kinds of people just graftin\u0027 away. Who cares what \u0027appened \u0027undreds of years ago?\u0027 \u0027Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute,\u0027 said the butler. \u0027He\u0027s not tearing your head off \u0027cos he\u0027s chained down.\u0027 \u0027So, why did you get us to chain you down?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027So I wouldn\u0027t tear off anybody\u0027s head. I suspected the truth, although I didn\u0027t know what it was that I suspected. At least, I think it works like that.\u0027 \u0027So that means you can\u0027t escape and tear us all limb from limb,\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs (no relation). \u0027No offence meant, but does this mean you won\u0027t be training us?\u0027 \u0027I am sorry,\u0027 said Nutt, \u0027but as you can see, I\u0027m rather inconvenienced.\u0027 \u0027Have you all gone loony?\u0027 Astonishingly, this came from Juliet, standing in the corridor. \u0027He\u0027s Nutt. He potters around making candles and stuff. I see \u0027im around all the time and \u0027e\u0027s never \u0027olding someone else\u0027s leg or head. And \u0027e likes his football, too!\u0027 Glenda thought she could actually hear Trev\u0027s heartbeat. She hurried over to the girl. \u0027I told you to go,\u0027 she hissed. \u0027I\u0027ve come back to tell Trev about everythin\u0027. After all, he did write such a lovely poem.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-13.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about football—the most important thing about football—is that it is never just about football.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
