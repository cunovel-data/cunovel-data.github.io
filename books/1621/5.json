{"id":94955,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Even Andy was frozen. No one had ever seen Trev like it, not old Trev. Even the Dollies knew Trev was smart. Trev was slick. Trev wasn\u0027t the sort to commit suicide by yelling at a bunch of men who were already tensed for a fight. The luckless Algernon, with Trev\u0027s rage baking his face, managed, \u0027But, like... he\u0027s a Dimmer... \u0027 \u0027Who are yer? You\u0027re a bloody fool, that\u0027s what you are!\u0027 screamed Trev. He rounded on the others, finger shaking. \u0027Who are yer? Who are yer? Nuffin! You\u0027re rubbish! You\u0027re all shite!\u0027 He jabbed the finger at Nutt. \u0027And him? He made stuff. He knew things. And he\u0027d never seen a game before today! He was only wearing the strip to fit in!\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t you worry, Trev, mate,\u0027 Andy hissed and raised his cutlass menacingly. \u0027There\u0027s going to be a bloody war about this!\u0027 But Trev was suddenly in his face like a wasp. \u0027You what? You are mental! You just don\u0027t get it, do you?\u0027 \u0027I can see helmets, Andy,\u0027 said Jumbo urgently. \u0027Me? What did I do?\u0027 \u0027As much as the stupid Stollops. Dimmers and Dollies? I hope the gods shit thin shit on both of you!\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re getting really close, Andy.\u0027 The Stollop boys, who were not altogether dumb, were already leaving. People in football strip were criss-crossing the city. The Watch couldn\u0027t chase everyone. But, well, belting some bloke who then bled a lot and stopped breathing, well, that was tantamount to murder, and the Old Sam could develop quite a turn of speed in those circumstances. Andy shook a furious finger at Trev. \u0027It\u0027s a hard life in the Shove when you\u0027re a dumb chuff with no mates.\u0027 \u0027This ain\u0027t the Shove!\u0027 \u0027Better wake up, kid. It\u0027s all Shove.\u0027 The Posse left at speed, although Jumbo turned for a moment to mouth \u0027sorry\u0027. They weren\u0027t the only ones hurrying off. The street people were all for a free cabaret, but this one might have associated difficulties: for example the asking of dangerous metaphysical questions such as \u0027Did you see anything?\u0027 and similar. It was all very well for the Watch to say \u0027the innocent have nothing to fear\u0027, but what was that all about? Who cared about the innocent and their problems when the Watch were on their way? Trev knelt by the cooling body of the late Nutt. And now for the first time in a minute, it seemed to Trev, he started to breathe again. He had stopped when he had raged at Andy \u0027cos if you talked like that to Andy you were dead anyway, so why waste your breath? There were things you had to do, weren\u0027t there? Weren\u0027t you supposed to keep banging on the chest to, like, show the broken heart how to beat again? But he didn\u0027t know how, and you didn\u0027t need much smarts to know that it was not a good idea to try to learn with the Watch on the way. It would not give a good first impression. That was why, when two watchmen turned up at speed, Trev was walking unsteadily towards them with Nutt in his arms. He was relieved to see that in charge was Constable Haddock: at least he was one of the ones who asked questions first. Behind him, and eclipsing most of the scenery, was Troll officer Bluejohn, who could clear a whole street just by walking down the centre of it. \u0027Can you help me get him to the Lady Sybil, Mister Haddock? He\u0027s very heavy,\u0027 said Trev. Constable Haddock pulled the sodden shirt aside, and made a sad little clicking sound. With experience comes familiarity. \u0027Morgue\u0027s closer, lad.\u0027 \u0027No!\u0027 Haddock nodded. \u0027You\u0027re Dave Likely\u0027s son, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t have to tell you!\u0027 \u0027No, \u0027cos I\u0027m right,\u0027 said Constable Haddock evenly. \u0027Okay, Trev. Bluejohn here will take this man, who I expect you have never seen before in your life, and we\u0027ll both run to keep up. There was a decent thunderstorm the night before last. He might be lucky. And so might you.\u0027 \u0027I never did it!\u0027 \u0027 \u0027course not. And now... let\u0027s see who\u0027s fastest at running, shall we? The hospital first.\u0027 \u0027I want to stay with him,\u0027 said Trev, as Bluejohn\u0027s huge hand gently cradled Nutt. \u0027No, lad,\u0027 said Haddock. \u0027You stay with me.\u0027 It didn\u0027t stop with Constable Haddock. It never did. Everyone called him Kipper, and his calm unspoken message that since we\u0027re all in this together, why make it hard for one another often worked, but sooner or later you\u0027d be handed over to a senior copper who manufactured hard, in a little room with another copper at the door. And this one had been working double shifts, by the look of her. \u0027I\u0027m Sergeant Angua, sir, and I hope you are not in trouble.\u0027 She opened a notebook and smoothed down the page. \u0027Shall we go through the motions? You told Constable Haddock that you saw a fight going on and when you got there all the big boys had run away and, amazingly, you found your workmate, Mister Nutts, bleeding to death. Well, I bet I can name all the big boys, every last one of them. I wonder why can\u0027t you? And what, Trevor Likely, is this about?\u0027 She flicked a black-and-white enamel token across the table, and by luck or judgement its pin stuck in the wood a few inches from Trev\u0027s hand. The unofficial motto of the Lady Sybil Free Hospital was \u0027Not everybody dies\u0027. It was true that, subsequent to the founding of the Lady Sybil, the chances of death from at least some causes in the city were quite amazingly reduced. Its surgeons were even known to wash their hands before operating as well as after. But moving through its white corridors now was a figure who knew, from personal experience, that the unofficial motto was, in reality, entirely mistaken. Death stood by the well-scrubbed slab and looked down. MISTER NUTT? WELL, THIS IS A SURPRISE, said Death, reaching into his robe. LET ME SEE WHAT I HAVE HERE. YOU KNOW, he said, I USED TO WONDER WHY PEOPLE SCRABBLED SO. AFTER ALL, COMPARED WITH THE LENGTH OF INFINITY, PEOPLE DO NOT LIVE ANY TIME AT ALL. EVEN YOU, MISTER NUTT. ALTHOUGH I CAN SEE THAT SCRABBLING WOULD WORK A LITTLE MAGIC IN YOUR CASE. \u0027I can\u0027t see you,\u0027 said Nutt. JUST AS WELL, said Death. YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER ME, IN ANY CASE, LATER ON. \u0027I\u0027m dying, then,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027YES. DYING AND THEN AGAIN LIVING. He fished out a life-timer from his robe and watched as the sand fell upwards. SEE YOU LATER, MISTER NUTT. I FEAR THAT YOU WILL HAVE AN INTERESTING LIFE. \u0027A Dolly favour on a good Dimmer boy? Gods bless my soul, I say, what can this be about? And you know what? I will find out. It\u0027s all a matter of shoving.\u0027 Trev said nothing. He was out of options. Besides, he had seen the sergeant before, and she always seemed to be looking at his throat. \u0027Constable Haddock tells me the Igor\u0027s on duty down at the Lady Sybil. I hope he\u0027s got a heart in his vats that\u0027ll fit your friend, I really do,\u0027 she said. \u0027But it\u0027ll still be a murder case, even if he comes walking in here tomorrow. Lord Vetinari\u0027s rules: if it takes an Igor to bring you back, you were dead. Briefly dead, it\u0027s true, which is why the murderer will be briefly hanged. A quarter of a second usually does it.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t touch \u0027im!\u0027 \u0027I know. But you have to keep solid with your mates, right? Jumbo and, of course, Carter, and, oh yes, Andy Shank, your mates, who aren\u0027t here. Look, you are not under arrest�Cyet�Cyou are helping the Watch with their inquiries. That means you can use the privy, if you\u0027re feeling brave. If you\u0027re feeling suicidal, use the canteen. But if you try to run off I will hunt you down.\u0027 She sniffed and added, \u0027Like a dog. Understand?\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t I go and see how Nutt is gettin\u0027 on?\u0027 \u0027No. Kipper\u0027s still down there now. That\u0027s Constable Haddock to you.\u0027 \u0027Everyone calls him Kipper.\u0027 \u0027Maybe, but not when it\u0027s you talking to me.\u0027 The sergeant twirled the favour around on the table in an absent-minded way. \u0027Has Mister Nutt got any next of kin? That means relatives.\u0027 \u0027I know what it means. He talks about people in Uberwald. That\u0027s all I know,\u0027 Trev lied instinctively. Saying that someone had spent his youth chained to an anvil was not going to help here. \u0027He gets on all right with the other guys in the vats.\u0027 \u0027How come he\u0027s in there?\u0027 \u0027We never ask. There\u0027s usually some bad story.\u0027 \u0027Anyone ever ask you?\u0027 He stared at her. That was coppers for you. They came over all friendly, and just when you dropped your guard they stuck a pickaxe in your brain. \u0027Was that an official copper question, or were you just bein\u0027 nosy?\u0027 \u0027Coppers are never nosy, Mister Likely. However, sometimes we ask tangential questions.\u0027 \u0027So it wasn\u0027t official?\u0027 \u0027Not really... \u0027 \u0027Then shove it where the sun does not shine.\u0027 Sergant Angua smiled a copper\u0027s smile. \u0027You\u0027ve got no card in your hand that you dare play, and you come out with something like that. From Andy, yes, I\u0027d expect it, but Kipper says you\u0027re smart. How smart does someone have to be to be as stupid as you?\u0027 There was a tentative knock at the door and then a watchman put his head around it. Someone was shouting in the background in a large, authoritative voice. \u0027 - I mean, you deal with this sort of thing all the time, don\u0027t you? For heavens\u0027 sake, it\u0027s not that hard - \u0027 \u0027Yes, Nobby?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve got a bit of a situation, sarge. That stiff that went to the Lady Sibyl? Doctor Lawn\u0027s here and he says the man\u0027s got up and gone home!\u0027 \u0027Did they get an Igor to look at him?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Sort of... er... \u0027 The watchman was elbowed out of the way by an expansive man in a long green rubber robe who was clearly trying to balance angry and friendly at the same time. He was tailed by Constable Haddock, who was clearly trying to mollify him, and definitely failing. \u0027Look, we try to help, all right?\u0027 said Doctor Lawn. \u0027You people say you\u0027ve got a murder case and I\u0027ll pull old Igor off his slab and hang the overtime. But you tell Sam Vimes from me that I\u0027d like him to send his boys down when they\u0027re not busy for a bit of first-aid tuition, to wit, the difference between dead and sleeping. It\u0027s a fine line sometimes, but it\u0027s generally possible to spot the clues. The profession has always tended to consider walking about to be among the more reliable, although in this city we\u0027ve learned to look on that as just a very good start. But when we pulled back the sheet he sat up and asked Igor if he had a sandwich, which is generally conclusive. Apart from a fever, he was fine. Strong heartbeat, which suggests he\u0027s got one. Not a scratch on him, but he could certainly do with a good dinner. He must have been hungry because he ate the sandwich Igor made for him. On the subject of dinners, frankly I could do with mine!\u0027 \u0027You let him go?\u0027 said Sergeant Angua, horrified. \u0027Of course! I can\u0027t keep a man in hospital for being inconveniently alive!\u0027 She turned to Constable Haddock. \u0027And you let him go, Kipper?\u0027 \u0027It looked like a case of doctor\u0027s orders, sarge,\u0027 said Haddock, giving Trev a wretched look. \u0027He was covered in blood! He was really messed up!\u0027 Trev exploded. \u0027A prank, then?\u0027 Angua tried. \u0027I\u0027d have sworn there wasn\u0027t a heartbeat, Sergeant,\u0027 Haddock volunteered. \u0027Maybe he\u0027s one of those monks from the Hub that do the hocus-pocus stuff.\u0027 \u0027Then someone has been wasting Watch time,\u0027 said Angua, glaring at Trev. He spotted that one for the desperate throw it was. \u0027What would be in it for me?\u0027 he said. \u0027Do you think I want to be here?\u0027 Constable Haddock cleared his throat. \u0027It\u0027s match night, sarge. The desk is heaving and there are supporters roaming around all over the place and someone\u0027s been feeding them a lot of rumours. We\u0027re stretched, that\u0027s all I\u0027m saying. We\u0027ve had a couple of big shouts already. And he did walk away, after all.\u0027 \u0027Not a problem for me,\u0027 said the doctor. \u0027Came in horizontal, went out upright. It\u0027s the preferred way. And I\u0027ve got to get back, sergeant. We\u0027re going to have a busy night, too.\u0027 The sergeant looked for someone to shout at, and there was Trev. \u0027You! Trev Likely. This one\u0027s down to you! Go and find your chum. And if there\u0027s any more trouble, there\u0027ll be... trouble. Is that clear?\u0027 \u0027Twice, sarge.\u0027 He couldn\u0027t resist it, he just couldn\u0027t, not even with the cold sweat rolling down his spine. But he felt light... uplifted... released. But some people just can\u0027t respect an epiphany when you\u0027re having one. It\u0027s not a cop skill. \u0027It\u0027s sergeant to you, Likely! Here!\u0027 Trev managed to catch the favour as it was skimmed across the room. \u0027Thanks, sarge!\u0027 \u0027Get out!\u0027 He got out, and was half expecting the shadowy shape that stepped up to him when he was clear of the building. There was a faint odour in the grey air. Well, at least it wasn\u0027t Andy. He could do without Andy right now. \u0027Yes, Carter?\u0027 he said to the fog. \u0027How did you know it was me?\u0027 Trev sighed. \u0027I guessed.\u0027 He started to walk fast. \u0027Andy\u0027ll want to know what you said.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s sorted.\u0027 \u0027Sorted! How?\u0027 Carter, always a bit overweight, had to scurry to keep up. \u0027Not going to tell you.\u0027 Oh, the joy of the moment. \u0027But can I tell him we\u0027re in the clear?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all sorted! Done and dusted! I blew it out. It\u0027s fixed. All gone away. It never happened.\u0027 \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 said Carter. \u0027He was pretty busted up.\u0027 \u0027Hey, what can I tell you?\u0027 Trev flung out his arms and twirled a pirouette. \u0027I\u0027m Trev Likely!\u0027 \u0027Well, that\u0027s firm, then. Hey, I bet Andy\u0027ll let you back in the Posse now. That would be great, eh?\u0027 \u0027Do you know what Nutt thought the Posse was called, Carter?\u0027 \u0027No. What?\u0027 Trev told him. \u0027Well, that\u0027s - \u0027 Carter began, but Trev interrupted. \u0027It\u0027s funny, Carter. It\u0027s funny, and sort of sad and hopeless. It really is.\u0027 Trev stopped walking so abruptly that Carter collided with him. \u0027And here\u0027s a tip: Carter the Farter isn\u0027t gonna take you anywhere. And that goes for the Fartmeister, too. Trust me.\u0027 \u0027But everybody calls me Carter the Farter,\u0027 the Fartmeister wailed. \u0027Punch the next one who does. See a doctor. Cut down on carbohydrates. Keep out of confined spaces. Use aftershave,\u0027 said Trev, speeding up again. \u0027Where are you going, Trev?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m gettin\u0027 out of the Shove!\u0027 Trev called over his shoulder. Carter looked around desperately. \u0027What Shove?\u0027 \u0027Haven\u0027t you heard? It\u0027s all Shove!\u0027 Trev wondered if he glowed as he trotted through the fog. Things were going to be different. As soon as Smeems got in, he\u0027d go and see him about a better job or something... A figure appeared out of the mist ahead of him. This was something of an achievement since the figure was a head shorter than him. \u0027Mithter Likely?\u0027 it said. \u0027Who\u0027s askin\u0027?\u0027 said Trev and added, \u0027What\u0027s askin\u0027?\u0027 The figure sighed. \u0027I underthtand that you are a friend of the gentleman rethently admitted to the hothpital,\u0027 it said. \u0027What\u0027s that to you?\u0027 \u0027Quite a lot,\u0027 said the figure. \u0027May I athk if you know very much about the gentleman?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t have to talk to you,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Everything\u0027s been fixed, okay?\u0027 \u0027Would that thith wath the cathe,\u0027 said the figure. \u0027I have to talk to you. My name ith Igor.\u0027 \u0027You know, I had a feelin\u0027 about that. Are you the one who made the sandwich for Nutt?\u0027 asked Trev. \u0027Yeth. Tuna, thpaghetti and jam, with thprinkleth. My thignature dith. Do you know anything about hith background?\u0027 \u0027Not a thing, mister.\u0027 \u0027Really?\u0027 \u0027Look. In the vats you stir up tallow, not the past, okay? You just don\u0027t, right? I know he\u0027s had some bad times, an\u0027 that\u0027s all I\u0027m telling you.\u0027 \u0027I thought tho,\u0027 said Igor. \u0027I believe he cometh from Uberwald. Thome thtrange and dangerouth thingth come from Uberwald.\u0027 \u0027This might sound a stupid question, but do you come from Uberwald, by any chance?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Thinth you athk, yeth,\u0027 said Igor. Trev hesitated. You saw Igors around occasionally. The only thing most people knew was that they could stitch you up even better than the Watch and did strange things in cellars and only tended to come out much when there were thunderstorms. \u0027I think your friend may be very dangerouth,\u0027 said Igor. Trev tried to picture Nutt as dangerous. It was quite hard until you remembered a throw that knocked down a whole goal post half a street away. He wished he didn\u0027t. \u0027Why should I listen to you? How do I know you are not dangerous?\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh, I am,\u0027 said Igor, \u0027believe me. And Uberwald containth thingth that I would not want to meet.\u0027 \u0027I am not gonna listen to you,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027And you are pretty hard to understand in any case.\u0027 \u0027Ith he thubject to thtrange moodth?\u0027 Igor ploughed on. \u0027Doth he get into a rage? Do you know anything about hith eating habitth?\u0027 \u0027Yes, he likes apple pies,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027What\u0027re you on about?\u0027 \u0027I can thee you are great friendth,\u0027 said Igor. \u0027I am thorry that I have trethpathed on your time.\u0027 \u0027Trethpathed\u0027 hanging in the air considerably added to the water drops hanging in the fog. \u0027I will give you thome advith. When you need me, jutht thcream. I regret that you will find it very eathy to thcream.\u0027 The figure turned and instantly vanished into the mist. And Igors moved about oddly, Trev remembered. And you never saw one at a football game... He noticed that last thought go past. What had he tried to tell himself? That someone who did not watch football was not a real person? He couldn\u0027t think of a proper answer. He was amazed that he had even asked the question. Things were changing. Glenda arrived in the Night Kitchen with Juliet sworn to silence, and beneficently gave Mildred and Mrs Hedges the rest of the night off. That suited them both very well, as it always does, and a little favour had been done there that she could call upon when necessary. She took her coat off and rolled up her sleeves. She felt at home in the Night Kitchen, in charge, in control. Behind black iron ranges she could defy the world. \u0027All right,\u0027 she said to the subdued Juliet. \u0027We weren\u0027t there today. Today did not happen. You were here helping me clean the ovens. I\u0027ll see you get some overtime so your dad won\u0027t suspect. Okay? Have you got that?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Glenda.\u0027 \u0027And while we\u0027re here we\u0027ll make a start on the pies for tomorrow night. It\u0027ll be nice to get ahead of ourselves, right?\u0027 Juliet said nothing. \u0027Say \"Yes, Glenda\",\u0027 Glenda prompted. \u0027Yes, Glenda.\u0027 \u0027Go and chop some pork, then. Being busy takes your mind off things, that\u0027s what I always say.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Glenda, that\u0027s what you always say,\u0027 said Juliet. An inflection caught Glenda\u0027s ear, and worried her a little. \u0027Do I always say that? When?\u0027 \u0027Every day when you come in and put your apron on, Glenda.\u0027 \u0027Mother used to say that,\u0027 said Glenda, and tried to shake the thought out of her head. \u0027And she was right, of course! Hard work never hurt anybody!\u0027 And she tried to unthink the treacherous thought: except her. Pies, she thought. You can rely on pies. Pies don\u0027t give you grief. \u0027I fink that Trev likes me,\u0027 Juliet muttered. \u0027He don\u0027t give me funny looks like the other boys. He looks like a little puppy.\u0027 \u0027You want to watch out for that look, my girl.\u0027 \u0027I fink I luvim, Glendy.\u0027 Wild boar, thought Glenda, and apricots. There\u0027s some left in the cool room. And we\u0027ve got mutton pies with a choice of tracklements... always popular. So... pork pies, I think, and there\u0027s some decent oysters in the pump room, so they\u0027ll do for the wet pie. I\u0027ll do Sea Pie and the anchovies look good, so there\u0027s always room for a Stargazey or two, even though I feel sorry for the little fishes, but right now I\u0027ll bake some blind pastries so that - \u0027What did you say?\u0027 \u0027I luvim.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t!\u0027 \u0027He saved my life!\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s no basis for a relationship! A polite thank you would have sufficed!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve got a feelin\u0027 about him!\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s just silly!\u0027 \u0027Well? Silly\u0027s not bad, is it?\u0027 \u0027Now you listen to me, young - Oh, hello, Mister Ottomy.\u0027 It is in the way of the Ottomies all around the worlds to look as if they have been built out of the worst parts of two men and to be annoyingly hushen-footed on thick red rubber soles, all the better to peep and pry. And they always assume that a free cup of tea is theirs by right. \u0027What a day, miss, what a day! Were you at the match?\u0027 he enquired, glancing from Glenda to Juliet. \u0027Been cleaning the ovens,\u0027 said Glenda briskly. \u0027Yes, today didn\u0027t happen,\u0027 Juliet added, and giggled. Glenda hated giggling. Ottomy looked around slowly and without embarrassment, noting the absence of dirt, discarded gloves, cloths - \u0027And we\u0027ve only just finished getting everything all neat and tidy,\u0027 Glenda snarled. \u0027Would you like a cup of tea, Mister Ottomy? And then you can tell us all about the game.\u0027 It has been said that crowds are stupid, but mostly they are simply confused, since as an eyewitness the average person is as reliable as a meringue lifejacket. It became obvious, as Ottomy went on, that nobody had any clear idea about anything other than that some bloke threw a goal from halfway down the street, and even then only maybe. \u0027But, funny thing,\u0027 Ottomy went on, as Glenda metaphorically let out a breath, \u0027while we was in the Shove, I could\u0027ve sworn I saw your lovely assistant here chatting to a lad in the Dimmer strip... \u0027 \u0027No law against that!\u0027 Glenda said. \u0027Anyway, she was here, cleaning the ovens.\u0027 It was clumsy, but she hated people like him, who lived for the exercise of third-hand authority and loved every little bit of power they could grab. He\u0027d seen more than he\u0027d told her, that was certain, and wanted her to wriggle. And out of the corner of her mind, she could feel him looking at their coats. Their wet coats. \u0027I thought you didn\u0027t go to the football, Mister Ottomy?\u0027 \u0027Ah, well, there you have it. The pointies wanted to go and watch a game, and me and Mister Nobbs had to go with them in case they got breathed on by ordinary people. Blimey, you wouldn\u0027t believe it! Tutting and complaining and taking notes, like they owned the street. They\u0027re up to something, you mark my words.\u0027 Glenda didn\u0027t like the word \u0027pointies\u0027, although it was a good description. Coming from Ottomy, though, it was an invitation to greasy conspiracy. But however you baked it, wizards were nobs, people who mattered, the movers and the shakers: and when people like that got interested in the doings of people who by definition did not matter, little people were about to be shaken, and shook. \u0027Vetinari doesn\u0027t like football,\u0027 she said. \u0027Well, o\u0027course, they\u0027re all in it together,\u0027 said Ottomy, tapping his nose. This caused a small lump of dried matter to shoot from his other nostril into his tea. Glenda had a brief struggle with her conscience over whether to point this out, but won. \u0027I thought you should know this, on account of how people up in the Sisters look up to you,\u0027 said Ottomy. \u0027I remember your mum. She was a saint, that woman. Always had a helping hand for everyone.\u0027 Yes, and didn\u0027t they grab, said Glenda to herself. She was lucky to die with all her fingers. Ottomy drained his mug and plonked it on the table with a sigh. \u0027Can\u0027t stand around here all day, eh?\u0027 \u0027Yes, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve got lots of other places to stand.\u0027 Ottomy paused at the entrance arch, and turned to grin at Juliet. \u0027A girl the spit and image of you, I\u0027d swear it. With a Dimmer boy. Amazing. You must have one of those double gangers. Well, it\u0027ll have to remain a mystery, as the man said when he found something that would have to remain a mystery. Toodle-oo - \u0027 He stopped dead rather than walk into the silvery knife that Glenda was holding in a not totally threatening way quite close to his throat. She had the satisfaction of seeing his Adam\u0027s apple pop back up and down again like a sick yoyo. \u0027Sorry about that,\u0027 she said, lowering it. \u0027I\u0027ve always got a knife in my hand these days. We\u0027ve been doing the pork. Very much like human flesh, pork, or so they say.\u0027 She put her spare hand across his shoulders and said, \u0027Probably not a good idea, spreading silly rumours, Mister Ottomy. You know how people can be so funny about that sort of thing. Nice of you to drop by and if you happen to be going past tomorrow I\u0027ll see that you get a pie. Do excuse us. I have a lot of chopping up to do.\u0027 He left at speed. Glenda, her heart pounding, looked at Juliet; her mouth made a perfect O. \u0027What? What?\u0027 \u0027I fort you was goin\u0027 to stab \u0027im!\u0027 \u0027I just happened to be holding a knife. You are holding a knife. We hold knives. This is a kitchen.\u0027 \u0027D\u0027you fink he\u0027s goin\u0027 to tell?\u0027 \u0027He doesn\u0027t really know anything.\u0027 Eight inches, she thought. That\u0027s as big as you can make a pie without a dish. How many pies could I make out of a weasel like Ottomy? The big mincer would make it easy. Ribcages and skulls must be a problem, though. Probably better, on the whole, to stick to pork. But the thought blazed away at the back of her mind, never to become action but unfamiliar, exciting and oddly liberating. What were the wizards doing at the game? Making notes about what? A puzzle to think about. In the meantime, they were in a world of pies. Juliet could work quite well at repetitive jobs when she put her mind to it, and she had a meticulousness often found in people who were not very clever. Occasionally she sniffed, not a good thing when you are making pie filling. She was probably thinking about Trev, and pasting him, in her beautiful and not very overcrowded head, into one of those glittery dreams sold by Bu-bubble and other junk, where all you had to do to be famous was just \u0027be yourself\u0027. Ha! While Glenda had always known what she wanted. She worked long, poorly paid hours to get it, and here it was: her own kitchen, and power, more or less... over pies! A moment ago you were daydreaming of turning a man into pies! Why are you so angry all the time? What went wrong? I\u0027ll tell you what went wrong! When you got there, there was no there there. You wanted to see Quirm from an open carriage while a nice young man drank champagne out of your slipper, but you never did, because they were a funny lot in Quirm, and you couldn\u0027t trust the water, and how did that champagne thing work, anyway? Didn\u0027t it drip out? What would happen if your toe trouble played up again... ? So you never did. Never will. \u0027I never said Trev\u0027s a bad lad,\u0027 she said aloud. \u0027Not a gentleman, needs a slap to teach him manners and he takes life a good deal too easily, but he could make something of himself if he had reason to put his mind to it.\u0027 Juliet did not seem to be listening, but you never could tell. \u0027It\u0027s just the football. You\u0027re on different sides. It won\u0027t work,\u0027 Glenda finished. \u0027S\u0027posing I went and supported the Dimmers?\u0027 A day ago that would have sounded like some kind of sacrilege; now it just presented a huge problem. \u0027For a start, your dad wouldn\u0027t speak to you ever again. Or your brothers.\u0027 \u0027They don\u0027t now, much, anyway, except to ask when their grub is goin\u0027 to be ready. D\u0027you know, today was the first time I ever saw the ball up close? And you know what? It weren\u0027t worth it. Hey, and they\u0027re goin\u0027 to have a fashion show on at Shatta tomorrow. Why don\u0027t we go?\u0027 \u0027Never heard of it,\u0027 Glenda snorted. \u0027It\u0027s a dwarf store.\u0027 \u0027That sounds right. I can\u0027t imagine humans naming anything like that. You\u0027d be hostage to the first misprint.\u0027 \u0027We could go. Might be fun.\u0027 Juliet waved a tattered copy of Bu-bubble. \u0027And the new micromails are going to be really good and soft, and don\u0027t chafe, it says here, plus, horned helmets are making a return after too long in obs... curi... tea. Where\u0027s that? And there\u0027s this mat... in... a tomorrow.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but we\u0027re not the kind of women who go to fashion shows, Jules.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re not. Why am I not?\u0027 \u0027Well, because... Well, I wouldn\u0027t know what to wear.\u0027 Glenda was getting desperate now. \u0027That\u0027s why you should go to fashion shows,\u0027 said Juliet smugly. Glenda opened her mouth to snap a reply, and thought: it\u0027s not about boys and it\u0027s not about football. It\u0027s safe. \u0027All right. I suppose it might be fun. Look, we\u0027ve done a woman\u0027s job this evening. I\u0027ll take you home now and do my chores and come back. Your dad might be worrying.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027ll be in the pub,\u0027 said Juliet accurately. \u0027Well, he would be worrying if he wasn\u0027t,\u0027 said Glenda. She wanted some time to herself with her feet up. It hadn\u0027t just been a long day, it had been a long and deep one as well. She needed some time for things to settle. \u0027And we\u0027ll take a chair, how about that?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re very expensive!\u0027 \u0027Well, you\u0027re only young once, that\u0027s what I say.\u0027 \u0027I never heard you say that before.\u0027 Several troll chairs were waiting outside the university. They were expensive at fivepence for the ride, but the seats in panniers round the carrier\u0027s neck were much more comfy than the slats on the buses. Of course, it was posh, and curtains twitched and lips pursed. That was the strange thing about the street: if you were born there, people didn\u0027t like it if you started not to fit in. Granny had called it \u0027getting ideas above your station\u0027. It was letting the side up. She opened Juliet\u0027s door for her because the girl always fumbled with the lock, and watched it shut. Only then did she open her own front door, which was as patched and peeling as the other one. She\u0027d hardly taken her coat off when there was a hammering on the weatherbeaten woodwork. She flung it open to find Mr Stollop, Juliet\u0027s father, one fist still raised and a little cloud of powdered paint flecks settling around him. \u0027Heard you come in, Glendy,\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s this all about?\u0027 His other huge hand rose, holding a crisp off-white envelope. You didn\u0027t see many of these in Dolly Sisters. \u0027It\u0027s called a letter,\u0027 said Glenda. The man held it out imploringly and now she noticed the large letter V on the dreaded government stamp, guaranteed to spread fear and despondency among those with taxes yet to pay. \u0027It\u0027s his lordship writing to me!\u0027 said Mr Stollop in distress. \u0027Why\u0027d he want to go and write to me? I haven\u0027t done nothing!\u0027 \u0027Have you thought about opening it?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027That\u0027s generally how we find out what\u0027s in letters.\u0027 There was another of those imploring looks. In Dolly Sisters reading and writing was soft indoor work that was best left to the women. Real work required broad backs, strong arms and calloused hands. Mr Stollop absolutely fitted the bill. He was captain of the Dollies and in one match had bitten an ear off three men. She sighed and took the letter from a hand which she noticed was slightly trembling and slit it open with her thumbnail. \u0027It says here, Mister Stollop,\u0027 she said, and the man winced. \u0027Yes. That would be you,\u0027 Glenda added. \u0027Is there anything about taxes or anything?\u0027 he said. \u0027Not that I can see. He writes that \"I would greatly appreciate your company at a dinner I am proposing to hold at Unseen University at eight o\u0027clock Wednesday evening to discuss the future of the famous game foot-the-ball. I will be pleased to welcome you as the captain of the Dolly Sisters team.\"\u0027 \u0027Why has he picked on me?\u0027 Stollop demanded. \u0027He says,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027because you\u0027re the captain.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but why me?\u0027 \u0027Maybe he\u0027s invited all the team captains,\u0027 Glenda volunteered. \u0027You could send a lad round with a white scarf and check, couldn\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, but supposing it\u0027s just me,\u0027 said Stollop again, determined to plumb the horror to its depths. Glenda had a bright idea. \u0027Well then, Mister Stollop, it would look like the captain of the Dolly Sisters is the only one important enough to discuss the future of football with the ruler himself.\u0027 Stollop didn\u0027t square his shoulders because he wore them permanently squared, but with a muscular nudge he managed to achieve the effect of cubed. \u0027Hah, he\u0027s got that one right!\u0027 he roared. Glenda sighed inwardly. The man was strong, but his muscles were melting into fat. She knew his knees hurt. She knew he got out of breath rather quickly these days and in the presence of something he couldn\u0027t bully, punch or kick, Mr Stollop was entirely at a loss. Down by his sides his hands flexed and unflexed themselves as they tried to do his thinking for him. \u0027What\u0027s this all about?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know, Mister Stollop.\u0027 He shifted his weight. \u0027Er, would it be about that Dimmer boy that got himself hurt today, d\u0027you think?\u0027 Could be anyone, thought Glenda as cold dread blossomed. It\u0027s not as though it doesn\u0027t happen every week. It doesn\u0027t have to be either of them. It will be, of course, I know it, but I don\u0027t know it, can\u0027t possibly know it, and if I repeat that long enough it might all never have happened. Got himself hurt, thought Glenda in the roar of panic. That quite likely means he happened to be standing in the wrong place in the wrong strip, which is tantamount to a self-inflicted wound. He got himself killed. \u0027My lads came in and said it was out in the street. That\u0027s what they just heard. He got killed, that\u0027s what they heard.\u0027 \u0027They didn\u0027t see anything?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right, they didn\u0027t see a thing.\u0027 \u0027But they were doing a lot of listening?\u0027 That one went over Stollop\u0027s head without even bothering to climb.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-5.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about football—the most important thing about football—is that it is never just about football.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
