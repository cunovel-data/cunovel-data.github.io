{"id":94969,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\u0027Number four. That was my dad\u0027s number.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027We know. Listen to \u0027em cheering, Trev.\u0027\\n\\n Trev looked like someone trying to find an escape clause. \u0027I\u0027ve never even trained with the new football. You know me, it\u0027s always been the tin can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a football. It\u0027s just a football,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027You\u0027ll get the hang of it in a second.\u0027\\n\\n The former Dean strode up. \u0027Well, this is all very gratifying with a touch of welcome pathos, ladies and gentlemen, but it is time we continued this football match and I would be very grateful if all non-players could stand back behind the touchlines,\u0027 he said, shouting to make himself heard above the noise of the crowd.\\n\\n Trev left Nutt at the goal. \u0027Don\u0027t you worry, Mister Trev,\u0027 said the orc, grinning. \u0027With me saving and you striking we can\u0027t lose. They won\u0027t get me the same way a second time.\u0027 He lowered his voice and grabbed Trev\u0027s shoulder. \u0027When it starts to get hot down this end, run like stink towards the other and I\u0027ll make sure you get the ball.\u0027 Trev nodded and walked across the turf to the cheers of the crowd.\\n\\n The editor of the Times later reported as follows: At this point, United seemed to feel that they had a working strategy and poured every resource into the university side in a m��l��e that was clearly beyond the referee to control. The plucky orc custodian had also learned a lesson and two or three times recovered the day with magnificent saves, on one occasion kicking the ball, in our opinion, directly at the head of one of the milling opponents, stunning him and then catching it upon the rebound, dropping it on to the boot and sending it far into the opposing half where Trevor Likely, son of the famous football hero, ran pell-mell towards the goal where Mr Charlie Barton had happily been provided with a chair, a table, a late lunch and two stalwart defenders, whose clear purpose it was to see that none shall pass. All breathing in the park surely ceased as the young paladin fired off a tremendous shot, which was, alas, out by a few inches and only served to rattle the woodwork and rebounded towards the defenders. Nevertheless, Likely tackled like a man possessed and spirits lifted once again as the two defenders got in each other\u0027s way just sufficiently for the boy to once again power the sphere back towards its intended resting place. Your correspondent believes that even the supporters of United joined in the groan as once again this second shot failed to find a slot and this time rebounded almost to the feet of H. Capstick, who lost no time in sending it screaming towards the Academicals\u0027 end before it could do more harm. Once again, the indefatigable Mr Nutt warded off a number of attacks while the rather pathetic remnant of the university boys\u0027 defence proved that prowess with the magic wand is of little avail if you do not know what your feet are for. At this point, Master of the Dark Arts Dr J. Hix was summarily dismissed from the field after the crowd\u0027s persistent chant of \u0027Who\u0027s the bastard in the black?\u0027 alerted the referee to his attempts at endeavouring to strike down F. Brisket, one of the notorious Brisket boys, with the soul-eating dagger of the Deadly Vampyre Spider Queen. Which, as it transpired, turned out to be neither magical nor, as it turned out, made of metal, but one of a number of similar items available in Boffo\u0027s Joke Emporium, Tenth Egg Street. Ranting apparently fearful oaths about university statute, Dr Hix had to be dragged from the field by members of his own team, leaving our spirited magicians in an even more depleted spell of difficulty, probably wishing they had a magic carpet to get them out of there!\\n\\n At least Dr Hix\u0027s tirade and attempts to drag the ground with him bought them some time. Glenda ran on to the pitch to a dishevelled and downcast Trev.\\n\\n \u0027What happened, Trev?\u0027 she said. \u0027You had it right there in front of you. You had it in your hands, well, on your boot, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t do what I want,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re supposed to make it do what you want. It\u0027s just a football.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, but I\u0027m tryin\u0027 to learn with all of this goin\u0027 on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, at least you nearly did it. We haven\u0027t lost yet and it\u0027s still only the first half.\u0027\\n\\n When play was resumed, according to the editor of the Times: A certain amount of backbone had been retrieved by the men in pointy hats and captain Nobbs led a concerted attack in an attempt to further interfere with Charlie Barton\u0027s lunch, but to the dismay of all, the son of Dave Likely still appeared to have only a nodding acquaintance with the art of goal scoring and it appeared very much that his only chance of putting one away would be to have the ball wrapped up and sent via the Post Office. And then, to the shock of all, the occult gang appeared to prove that they were far better at billiards than football when another of Likely\u0027s powerful, but directionless, attempts rebounded again off the goal on to the head of Professor Rincewind, who was, in fact, running in the opposite direction, and was in the back of the goal before anyone, including Charlie, knew where it was. This got a cheer, but only because the game now appeared, in our opinion, to be a comedy routine. Alas, there was no comedy about the fact that in several parts of the Hippo, fights were breaking out between gangs of rival supporters, doubtless inspired by some of the shameful performances on the pitch...\\n\\n As the two sides trooped or hobbled back to their places, the referee called the captains together. \u0027Gentlemen, I\u0027m not quite sure what we are doing here, but I am quite certain that it\u0027s not exactly football and I look forward to the inquiry later on. In the meantime, before anyone else is injured and especially before the crowd start to tear this place apart and eat one another, I will tell you that the next goal scored will be the last one, even though we are still only in the first half.\u0027 He looked meaningfully at Hoggett and said, \u0027I sincerely hope that some players will examine their consciences. If I may coin a phrase, gentlemen, it\u0027s sudden death either way. I will give you a few minutes to impress this upon your teams.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am sorry, sir,\u0027 said Hoggett, looking around, \u0027some of my lads are not people I would have chosen, if you get my drift. I\u0027ll give them a good talking to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In my opinion that would only work if you were hitting them with a hammer at the same time, Mister Hoggett. They are a disgrace. And do you also understand me, Mister Nobbs?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think we\u0027d like to carry on, too. Never say die.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I would not like to see death here, either, but I suspect that your request for extra time is in the hope that Mister Likely will learn how to play football, but I fear that will not happen in a month of Sundays.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes, sir, but can\u0027t you - \u0027 Hoggett began.\\n\\n \u0027Mister Hoggett, I have spoken and I am the referee and right now I am the nearest thing to the gods.\u0027\\n\\n I am the nearest thing to the gods. It came back as an echo. Softer. Brighter. He looked around, \u0027What? Did you chaps say something?\u0027 Nearest thing to the gods. There was a sound like gloing! But the ball was still in his hands, wasn\u0027t it? He stared at it. And was it just him, or was there something in the air? Something... in the air... the silveryness of fine winter days.\\n\\n Trev did an embarrassingly jiggly little run on the spot as he waited. When he looked up, there was Andy Shank watching him.\\n\\n \u0027Your dear old dad must be \u0027aving a fit,\u0027 said Andy cheerfully.\\n\\n \u0027I know you, Andy,\u0027 said Trev wearily, \u0027I know what you do. You corner some poor tosser and taunt \u0027im until \u0027e loses \u0027is rag and so \u0027e starts it, doesn\u0027t \u0027e? I\u0027m not risin\u0027 to it, Andy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not risin\u0027 to anythin\u0027 very much, are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not listenin\u0027, Andy,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I reckon you are.\u0027\\n\\n Trev sighed again. \u0027I\u0027ve been watchin\u0027 you. You and your chums are bloody masters at stickin\u0027 the boot in when the ref ain\u0027t lookin\u0027 and what \u0027e don\u0027t see \u0027e can\u0027t do nothin\u0027 about.\u0027\\n\\n Andy lowered his voice. \u0027Well, I can do something about you, Trev. You won\u0027t be walking out of this place, I swear it. You\u0027ll be carried out.\u0027\\n\\n There was the sound of the whistle, followed by the unstoppable \u0027ANY BOY WHO HAS NOT BROUGHT HIS KIT WILL PLAY IN HIS PANTS!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sudden death,\u0027 the former Dean said and the sides collided, Andy emerging with the ball at his feet and his dishonour guard flanking him at either side.\\n\\n Ponder Stibbons, in the path of their advance, calculated quite a lot of things very quickly, such as speed, wind direction and the likelihood of being physically trodden into the turf. He made an effort at any rate, but ended up flat on his back after the collision. As the editor of the Times put it: in this scene of despair, dismay and disarray, one lone defender, Nutt, stood in the way of United\u0027s winning goal...\\n\\n There was a roar immediately behind Nutt. He daren\u0027t look round, but someone landed on top of the goal, making it shake, dropped down and indicated by means of one huge and horny thumb that Mr Nutt\u0027s assistance was no longer required. There was a green crust around the Librarian\u0027s mouth, but this was nothing to the fire in his eyes.\\n\\n At this point, according to the editor of the Times: Seemingly nonplussed by the return of the wizards\u0027 famous man of the forest, Shank essayed another attempt at the winning score, which was stopped one-handed by the Librarian and effortlessly thrown back into United\u0027s turf. With everything to play for, it seemed to us that every man on the pitch was chasing the ball as if they were a pack of boys, scuffling in the gutter for the traditional tin can. However, Mr Nobbs, who we are assured is no relation, was able to make some space to give the unlucky Mr Likely another attempt at following in his father\u0027s footsteps, which he failed to do by the width, from our estimation, of about half of one inch and the ball was snatched up by Big Boy Barton who then collapsed, choking, having stuffed, we understand, a considerable amount of pie into his face to keep his hands free.\\n\\n \u0027It shouldn\u0027t be like this,\u0027 said Glenda, and the thought echoed back in her head: It shouldn\u0027t be like this. \u0027Trev has to win, it can\u0027t go any other way.\u0027 And her voice came back again; could you get echoes in your own head? They were going to lose, weren\u0027t they? They were going to lose because Andy knew how to break the rules.\\n\\n The rules.\\n\\n I am the rules.\\n\\n She looked around, but apart from the doctor and his groaning or, in Ridcully\u0027s case, cursing charges, there was no one near her apart from Juliet who was watching the game with her normal, faint smile.\\n\\n \u0027Good heavens. All he needs is to get only one goal,\u0027 said Glenda aloud.\\n\\n I am the goal, said the quiet voice from nowhere.\\n\\n \u0027Did you hear that?\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027Wot?\u0027 said Juliet. She turned and Glenda could see that she was crying. \u0027Trev\u0027s going to lose.\u0027\\n\\n I am the ball.\\n\\n This time it had come from her pocket, and she pulled out Trev\u0027s tin can.\\n\\n As Doctor Lawn gave a groan and hurried back up the pitch towards the choking Charlie (as the Times later put it), she followed him and caught up with Mr Nobbs. \u0027If you ever want a cup of tea and a piece of cake again in your life, Mr Nobbs, you kick the ball towards me. You will know where I am, because I will be screaming and acting silly. Do what I say, okay?\u0027\\n\\n Do what she says, okay? he heard her voice echo. \u0027And what will you do, throw it back?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Something like that,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027And what good is this going to do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s going to win you the match, that\u0027s what. Can you remember rule 202?\u0027\\n\\n She left him wondering and then hurried along to Mrs Whitlow and the cheerleaders who, right now, had nothing to cheer about. \u0027I think we should give the boys a really good display at this time,\u0027 she suggested. \u0027Don\u0027t you agree, Juliet?\u0027\\n\\n Juliet, who had been dutifully following her said, \u0027Yes, Glenda.\u0027\\n\\n Yes, Glenda. And there it was again. One sentence. Two voices.\\n\\n Mrs Whitlow was not the sort of person who would take an instruction from the head of the Night Kitchen, but Glenda leaned forward and said, \u0027It\u0027s the Archchancellor\u0027s special request.\u0027\\n\\n The resurrection of Big Boy Barton was not an easy job and there were possibly fewer volunteers for putting their fingers down his throat than there had been for the Librarian. And his emptying and cleaning up took a little more time.\\n\\n As the referee summoned the teams back into position, Glenda arrived out of breath and handed him a piece of paper. \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the rules, sir, but you will see that I have put a ring around one of them.\u0027\\n\\n He glanced at it, and said dismissively, \u0027Looks like a lot of nonsense to me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not, sir, not if you look at it a bit at a time, sir, it\u0027s the rules, sir.\u0027\\n\\n Archchancellor Henry shrugged and stuffed the paper into his pocket.\\n\\n For a moment, Bledlow Nobbs glanced at Glenda, defiantly out of place amongst the cheerleaders. Glenda was known to be generous to her friends and she made the best tea in the university. This wasn\u0027t about football, this was about a hot mug of tea and possibly a doughnut. He leaned down to Nutt. \u0027Glenda says I\u0027ve got to remember rule 202,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Nutt\u0027s face brightened. \u0027Clever idea and of course it will work. Did she tell you to kick the ball out of the pitch?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s right. Are we going to cheat?\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs.\\n\\n \u0027No. We are going to stick to the rules. And the thing about sticking to the rules is that it\u0027s sometimes better than cheating.\u0027\\n\\n Nobbs\u0027s chance came soon enough, surprisingly with an obviously misdirected pass from Hoggett. Had Hoggett been standing very close when they had been talking? And had he just said \u0027Go for it?\u0027 It sounded very much like it. He kicked the ball straight towards the cheerleaders, where Glenda snatched it out of the air and pushed it into the folds of Mrs Whitlow\u0027s skirt. \u0027You haven\u0027t seen this, ladies, you haven\u0027t seen where it is and you\u0027re not moving for anyone, okay?\u0027\\n\\n As the crowd booed and cheered, she pulled the tin can out of her bag and held it up in the air. \u0027Ball lost!\u0027 she yelled. \u0027Substitute ball!\u0027 and threw the can directly towards the bledlow, who was quick enough to flick it on to Nutt. Before any other player had moved, it landed with a little gloing! sound on the end of Trev Likely\u0027s boot...\\n\\n According to the editor of the Times: We have been assured that no magic was used on the day of the match and it is not my place to contradict the honourable faculty of Unseen University. All your correspondent will say is that Trevor Likely kicked the \u0027ball\u0027, against all probability, towards the Academicals\u0027 goal, where he stood, apparently waiting for the stampede of the enraged United squad. What followed, your correspondent must declare, was not just a goal, but it was a punishment and it was a retribution. It was writing the name Likely, for the second time, in the annals of football history, as Trevor, famous son of a famous father, wiped the floor with United, wrung them out and did it all over again. Running. Dodging. Sometimes obligingly kicking the \u0027ball\u0027 directly towards a defender who then found it heading off in quite a different direction, which just happened to be where Likely was now. He taunted them. He played with them. He caused them to collide with one another as they both went for a ball that, inexplicably, was no longer where they were sure it had been. And it must have come as a relief to the more steady members of United when he relented and skipped the \u0027ball\u0027 over the head of their standby keeper, Micky Pulford (latterly of the Whopping Street Wanderers) and into the net, where it circled and then returned to land precisely on the tip of Likely\u0027s boot. The silence...\\n\\n ... spread like warm butter. Glenda was sure she could hear distant birdsong or, possibly, the noise of worms under the turf, but definitely the sound from Dr Lawn\u0027s impromptu field hospital, the sound of \u0027Big Boy\u0027 Barton chucking up again.\\n\\n And then, where silence had reigned, sound poured like the gush of water from a broken dam. It was physical and it was complex. Here and there the spectators started chanting. All the chants of all the teams, united and harmonizing in one perfect moment.\\n\\n Glenda watched in amazement as Juliet... It was like the fashion show all over again. She seemed to light up from the inside, bars of golden light floating away from the micromail. She started to run towards Trev, tearing off her beard, and, Glenda could see, gradually rising from the ground as though she was running up a stairway.\\n\\n It was a strange and wonderful sight, and not even Charlie Barton, still throwing up, could detract from it.\\n\\n \u0027 \u0027scuse me,\u0027 said Mister Hoggett. \u0027That was a goal, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Mister Hoggett, I think it was,\u0027 said the referee.\\n\\n Hoggett was pushed out of the way by Andy Shank. \u0027No! It went to one side! Are you bloody blind, or what? And it was a tin can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Mister Shank, it was not. Gentlemen, can you not see what\u0027s happening in front of your faces? Look, everything that happened was perfectly legal under the rules of the game, rule 202, to be precise. It\u0027s a fossil, but it is a rule, and I can assure you that no magic was used. But right now, gentlemen, can you not see the golden lady floating up in the air?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, right, that\u0027s just more weird kids\u0027 stuff, just like that goal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is football, Mister Shank, it\u0027s all weird kids\u0027 stuff.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So the game is over,\u0027 said Mr Hoggett.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Mister Hoggett, it is. Apart from, and I insist on drawing your attention to it, a beautiful golden lady floating over the pitch. Am I the only one seeing this?\u0027\\n\\n Hoggett glanced towards the rising Juliet. \u0027Yeah, right, very pretty, but we\u0027ve lost, have we?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Mister Hoggett, you have clearly and emphatically lost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And, just to be precise,\u0027 said Hoggett, \u0027there are no more, like, rules, are there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Mister Hoggett, you are no longer subject to the rules of football.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you for that clarification, your worship, and may I also thank you on behalf of United for the way you handled the trying events of this afternoon.\u0027\\n\\n With this, he turned and punched Andy full in the face. Mister Hoggett was a mild man, but years of lifting a pig carcass in each hand meant that he had a punch that even Andy\u0027s thick skin had to reckon with. Even so, after Andy had blinked a few times he managed to say, \u0027You bastard.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You lost us the game,\u0027 said Hoggett. \u0027We could have won fair and square, but you had to muck it up.\u0027 And those around him felt able to murmur in support of the accusation.\\n\\n \u0027Me? It wasn\u0027t me! It was that bloody Trev Likely and his little orc chum. They was using magic. You can\u0027t say that wasn\u0027t magic.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just skill, I assure you,\u0027 said the former Dean. \u0027Amazing skill, certainly, but he is well known for his prowess with the tin can, which itself is a veritable icon of football.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where is that bloody Likely, anyway?\u0027\\n\\n Glenda, eyes fixed on the centre of the pitch, said in the voice of someone half hypnotized, \u0027He\u0027s rising up in the air as well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look, you can\u0027t tell me that\u0027s not magic,\u0027 Andy insisted.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You know what, I think it\u0027s religion. Can\u0027t you hear?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t hear anything, dear, with all the noise from the crowd,\u0027 said the former Dean.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Listen to the crowd.\u0027\\n\\n He did. It was a roar, a great sky-filling roar, old and animal and coming up from the gods knew where, but inside it, travelling like a hidden message, he made out the words. They swam into focus, if indeed the ear could focus and if he was actually hearing them with his ears. They might have been coming through his bones... If the striker thinks he scores Or if the keeper cries in shame They understand not the crowd\u0027s applause I make, and hear and earn again For I am the crowd and I am the ball I am the triumph and the blame I am the turf, the pies, the All Always and ever, I am the Game. It matters not who won or lost Nothing is the score you made Fame is a petal that curls in the frost But I will remember how you played.\\n\\n And it stays there, Glenda thought, like sound in a banner. Everybody one part of it.\\n\\n Juliet and Trev began to float down, hand in hand, turning gently until they landed lightly on the turf, still kissing. A sort of reality began to leak back into the arena, and there are some people who, even when hearing the voice of the nightingale, will say \u0027What\u0027s that bloody noise?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cheatin\u0027 bastard,\u0027 said Andy and launched himself directly at Trev, covering the ground at speed as the boy stood there with a very bemused but happy expression on his face. He did not notice the hell-bent Andy until a huge boot kicked him squarely in the groin, so hard that the eyes of all male watchers watered in sympathetic pain.\\n\\n For the second time in twenty-four hours, Trev felt the micromail sing as the thousands of links moved and just as quickly settled down again. It was as if a little breeze had blown up his pants. Apart from that, he hadn\u0027t felt a thing.\\n\\n Andy, on the other hand, had. He was lying on the ground, bent double, making a sort of whistling noise through his teeth.\\n\\n Someone slapped Trev on the back. It was Pepe.\\n\\n \u0027You did put my pants on, didn\u0027t you? Well, obviously not my pants. You\u0027d have to be suicidal to want to put my pants on. Anyway, I\u0027ve come up with a name for the stuff: I\u0027m going to call it Retribushium. Can\u0027t ever say it will be an end to war, \u0027cos I can\u0027t imagine anything putting an end to war, but it sends the force back the way it came. Didn\u0027t chafe either, did it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Trev, amazed.\\n\\n \u0027Well, it did for him! My word, though, he\u0027s a game one. That reminds me, I\u0027ll need a picture of you in them.\u0027\\n\\n Andy was rising slowly, elevating himself to the vertical almost by willpower alone. Pepe grinned, and somehow it seemed obvious to Trev that anyone who was going to get up and try any threats with Pepe grinning at him was more than suicidal.\\n\\n \u0027Got a knife, have you, you little squirt?\u0027 said Andy.\\n\\n \u0027No, Andy,\u0027 said Nutt behind him. \u0027No more. The game is over. Fortune has favoured Unseen Academicals and I believe the traditional ending is to exchange shirts in an atmosphere of good fellowship.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But not pants,\u0027 said Pepe under his breath.\\n\\n \u0027What do you know about that sort of thing?\u0027 growled Andy. \u0027You\u0027re a bloody orc. I know all about you people. You can tear arms and legs off. You\u0027re black magic. I\u0027m not scared of you.\u0027 He came at Nutt with commendable speed for a man in such pain.\\n\\n Nutt dodged. \u0027I believe there is a peaceful solution to the obvious enmity between us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You what?!\u0027\\n\\n Pepe and some of the footballers were closing in. Andy had not been making friends. Nutt waved them away.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure I could help you, Andy. Yes, you are right, I am an orc, but doesn\u0027t an orc have eyes? Doesn\u0027t an orc have ears? Doesn\u0027t an orc have arms and legs?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, at the moment,\u0027 said Andy, and leaped.\\n\\n What happened next happened so fast that Trev didn\u0027t see the middle of it. It started with Andy jumping and finished with him sitting on the ground with Nutt\u0027s hands clamped around his head, claws out. \u0027Let me see now,\u0027 Nutt mused as the man struggled in vain. \u0027Twisting the skull with enough force to snap the spine and spinal column should not present much difficulty since it is a non-rotating joint. And, of course, the ear holes and eye sockets allow for extra grip in the manner of a bowling ball,\u0027 he added happily.\\n\\n There was a horrified hush as he continued. \u0027Using the unit of measurement of force invented by Sir Rosewood Bunn, I should think that a mere 250 Bunns should do the trick. But, of course, and possibly surprisingly, it is the tearing of the skin, tendons and muscles that would present me with some difficulty. You are a young man and the tensile strength would be quite high. I imagine the skin alone would require a force of about a thousand Bunns.\u0027\\n\\n Andy yelped as his head was gently twisted.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I say! Look here now!\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027A joke is a joke and all that, but... \u0027\\n\\n \u0027From then on it gets rather messy,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Muscle would tear off the bones comparatively easily.\u0027\\n\\n Andy gave another strangled yelp.\\n\\n \u0027But taking it all in all, I would think a force of between three to five Kilobunns should do the trick.\u0027 He paused. \u0027Just my little joke, Andy. I know you like a laugh. I would also, I believe, be quite capable of putting one hand down your throat and pulling out your stomach.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go ahead,\u0027 croaked Andy.\\n\\n And around the arena of the Hippo, the beast smelled blood. After all, it wasn\u0027t just horse racing that had taken place in the Hippo over the centuries. The comparatively small amount of blood that had been shed today was nothing compared with the oceans of the centuries gone by, but the beast knew blood when it smelled it. The cheering and the chanting now picked up, and the words grew louder and louder as people rose to their feet: Orc! Orc! Orc!\\n\\n Nutt stood impassively and then turned to the former Dean. \u0027Could I please ask everyone else to leave? This may become messy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, come on!\u0027 said Trev. \u0027No way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah, well,\u0027 said Nutt, \u0027maybe just the ladies?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not likely,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027In that case, would you please be so kind as to lend me your megaphone, referee, and I would be grateful if you would instruct some of the stronger players on the field to restrain Mister Shank who is, I believe, sadly not in his right mind.\u0027\\n\\n Wordlessly it was handed over. Nutt took it as the storm of Orc! Orc! grew louder, walked a little way from the rest of the group and stood there impassively with his arms folded until the taunting stopped out of sheer lack of momentum. With every eye watching him, he raised the megaphone to his lips and said, \u0027Gentlemen. Yes, indeed, I am an orc and will always be one. And may I say that it\u0027s been a privilege to play here today and to see you all. But I do gather now that being an orc in this city may be seen as something of a problem to some of you.\u0027 He paused. \u0027So I would ask you to excuse me if I request that this matter be sorted out between us now.\u0027\\n\\n There was laughter and some jeers from various parts of the ground, but also, it seemed to Glenda, the beast was calling upon itself for silence. In that pin-drop silence the thud of the megaphone hitting the ground could be heard in every corner. Then Nutt rolled up his sleeves and lowered his voice so that people had to strain to listen.\\n\\n He said, \u0027Come on if you think you\u0027re hard enough.\u0027\\n\\n First there was shock and then the silence of disbelief and the whisper of every head turning to every other head and saying, \u0027Did he really say that?\u0027 and then someone high in the stands started to clap, at first slowly and then at an accelerating tempo, as it reached the crowd\u0027s tipping point, when not clapping would be unthinkable. Ceasing to clap was also unthinkable and within a minute the applause was a storm.\\n\\n Nutt turned back to the rest of the team with tears streaming down his face. \u0027Do I have worth?\u0027 he said to Glenda.\\n\\n She ran towards him and hugged him. \u0027You always did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then when the match is over there are things we have to do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it\u0027s been over for ages,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027No, it\u0027s not over until the referee blows his whistle. Everyone knows that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027By Io he\u0027s right,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Go on, Dean. Give it the works!\u0027\\n\\n The Archchancellor of Brazeneck University felt gracious enough to let that one pass. He put the gigantic whistle to his lips, filled his lungs with air and sent the pea rattling. Despite everything, the shade of Evans the Striped had the last word: \u0027NO BOY IS TO FIDDLE ABOUT IN THE SHOWERS!\u0027\\n\\n As the crowd streamed down from the stands, trampling the now sacred turf, Ridcully tapped a gloomy Mr Hoggett on the shoulder and said, \u0027It would be my privilege to change shirts with you, sir.\u0027 He dropped his hat on the ground, pulled off his shirt and revealed a chest so hairy that it looked like two sleeping lions. The United shirt he received in return was somewhat of a tight fit, but that was unimportant because, as Andy had predicted, the Unseen Academicals were indeed picked up by the yelling crowd (except for Mrs Whitlow who fought back) and carried in glory through the city. It was a triumph. Whether you won or lost, it was still a triumph.\\n\\n You think it\u0027s all over?\\n\\n The wizards of Unseen University knew how to party. Pepe and Madame Sharn were impressed. However, business was business and they had to think about Juliet. \u0027I can\u0027t see her anywhere,\u0027 said Madame.\\n\\n \u0027I think I saw two of her a while ago,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027These fellows do themselves well�CI have never seen such a large cheeseboard. It almost makes celibacy seem worthwhile.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, do you think so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. By the way, have you noticed that very tall wizard giving you the eye, my dear?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s Professor Bengo Macarona. Do you think he - \u0027 Madame began.\\n\\n \u0027Without a shadow of a doubt, my dear. I know he\u0027s hurt his legs, but I doubt if that would be a problem.\u0027\\n\\n Once again, Madame craned to search the crowd for the glittering figure. \u0027I do hope our young model is not getting involved in any hanky panky.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How could she? She\u0027s totally surrounded by admirers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s still possible.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-19.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) \\n The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. \\n Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about football—the most important thing about football—is that it is never just about football.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
