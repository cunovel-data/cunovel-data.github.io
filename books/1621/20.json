{"id":94970,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"In fact, Juliet and Trev were sitting in the darkness of the Night Kitchen. \u0027I\u0027ll find somethin\u0027 to do,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I\u0027ll go wherever you go.\u0027 \u0027You ought to stay here and play football,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027You know what some people said when we were drinking? They said Dave Likely was your father.\u0027 \u0027Well, yes, that\u0027s true.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Juliet, \u0027but they used to say you were his son.\u0027 \u0027Well, maybe a bit of football,\u0027 Trev conceded, \u0027but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll get away with the tin can again.\u0027 They kissed. There and then, that was all that appeared necessary. However... Glenda and Nutt had also wanted to find a place a little out of the way and, if possible, dark. Fortuitously she had pulled out of her pocket a pair of tickets, placed there by Dr Hix in his attempt to spread darkness and despondency throughout the world by the means of amateur dramatics, to the Dolly Sisters Players\u0027 production of Starcrossed by Hwel the Playwright. They sat hand in hand, watching it solemnly, feeling the ripples move them, then discussed it as they walked back through the city, carefully skirting the chanting bands of happy, drunken supporters. \u0027What did you think?\u0027 said Nutt, after a while. \u0027About the play, I mean.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t see that it was that romantic,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027To be honest, I thought it was a bit silly.\u0027 \u0027It is widely regarded as one of the great romantic plays of the last fifty years,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Really? But what type of example are they setting? First of all, didn\u0027t anyone in Genua, even in those days, know how to take a pulse? Is a little first-aid knowledge too much to expect? Even a hand mirror would have helped and there are quite a number of respectable places where you can take a pulse.\u0027 \u0027I think that\u0027s because neither of them were thinking about themselves, perhaps,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Neither of them was thinking at all,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027and they certainly weren\u0027t thinking about each other as people. A little common sense and they would be alive. It\u0027s made-up, like books. I don\u0027t think anyone sensible would act like that.\u0027 He squeezed her hand. \u0027Sometimes you speak like Ladyship,\u0027 he said, \u0027and that reminds me.\u0027 \u0027Reminds you of what?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s time for me to meet my maker.\u0027 Andy Shank walked unsteadily among the night-time alleys, secure in the knowledge that they contained nothing worse than him, a belief which, as it happened, was in error. \u0027Mister Shank?\u0027 \u0027Who\u0027s asking?\u0027 he said, turning around and reaching instinctively into his coat for his new cutlass. But another knife, silver and thin, sliced twice and a foot expertly stamped the length of his shin and forced him to the ground. \u0027Me! I\u0027m the happy ending. You can call me the good fairy. Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll be able to see by the time you wipe the blood out of your eyes and, as they say, now you won\u0027t have to pay for a drink in any bar in this town, though I suspect you never have.\u0027 His attacker leaned nonchalantly against the wall. \u0027And the reason I am doing this, Mister Shank, is that I am a bastard. I am an old bugger. I am a sod. They let you get away with it because they were nice people and, you know, the world needs someone like me to set the balance square. Since before you were born I have known people like you. Tormentors, bullies and thieves. Ah yes, thieves. Thieves of other people\u0027s self-respect. Thieves of their peace of mind. Now Mister Nutt, he\u0027s an orc and I\u0027ve heard that he can talk people better. Well, so be it, say I. If it works, he\u0027s a genius, but that don\u0027t square things, not in my book, so I thought you ought to meet Pepe, just to say hello. If I ever see you again, they\u0027ll never find all the pieces, but just to show that I have a decent streak, here\u0027s something to put on your wounds.\u0027 Something landed softly near Andy\u0027s groping hand. Andy, dripping blood and snot on to the pavement, reached around quickly as the trim little footsteps disappeared, thinking only of getting the blood out of his eyes and revenge and retribution out of his heart. And in the circumstances, therefore, he should not have wiped the half-lemon across his face. You think it\u0027s all over? It is a regrettable fact that when two people are dining at a very large and impressive dining table they sit at the opposite ends of the long axis. This is incredibly stupid and makes conversation difficult and the passing of food impossible, but even Lord Vetinari and Lady Margolotta had apparently signed up to the idea. On the other hand, they both ate very little and so there wasn\u0027t very much to pass. \u0027Your secretary seems to be getting on very well with my librarian,\u0027 said Lady Margolotta. \u0027Yes,\u0027 observed Vetinari. \u0027Apparently they are comparing ring binders. He has invented a new one.\u0027 \u0027Well, for the proper working of the world,\u0027 said Lady Margolotta, \u0027it is essential that ring binders are important to at least one person.\u0027 She put down her glass and looked towards the door. \u0027You seem nervous,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Are you wondering how he will come?\u0027 \u0027He has had a very long day and a remarkably successful one. And you say he\u0027s gone to an amateur dramatics performance?\u0027 \u0027Yes, with that very forthright young lady who makes the pies,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027I see,\u0027 said Lady Margolotta. \u0027He must know I am here and he\u0027s gone off with a cook?\u0027 There was just a trace of a smile on Vetinari\u0027s lips. \u0027Not any cook. A genius amongst cooks.\u0027 \u0027Well, I must admit to being surprised,\u0027 said her ladyship. \u0027And upset?\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027A little jealous, perhaps?\u0027 \u0027Havelock, you go too far!\u0027 \u0027Would you expect otherwise? Besides, you must surely realize that his triumph is yours too?\u0027 \u0027Did I tell you that I\u0027ve seen some of them?\u0027 said Margolotta after a while. \u0027The orcs?\u0027 \u0027Yes. They really are wretched. Of course, people say that about the goblins and while it is true that they religiously save their own snot, and, frankly, just about everything else, at least there is a logic to it.\u0027 \u0027Well, a religious logic, at least,\u0027 murmured Vetinari. \u0027They tend to be quite stretchable.\u0027 \u0027The Igors made them from men, did you know?\u0027 Vetinari, still holding his glass, walked to the other end of the table and picked up the pepperpot. \u0027No. However, now you tell me, it\u0027s patently obvious. Goblins would not have been nearly ferocious enough.\u0027 \u0027And they had nothing,\u0027 said Margolotta. \u0027No culture, no legends, no historyÂ¨Che could give them those.\u0027 \u0027Everything they are not, he is,\u0027 said Vetinari, adding, \u0027but that\u0027s an enormous weight you\u0027re putting on his shoulders.\u0027 \u0027How much is on mine? How much of a weight is on yours?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s rather like being a carthorse,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027After a while one ceases to notice, it\u0027s just the way of life.\u0027 \u0027They deserve their chance and it must be taken now, while the world is at peace.\u0027 \u0027Peace?\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Ah, yes, defined as a period of time to allow for preparation for the next war.\u0027 \u0027Where did you learn such cynicism, Havelock?\u0027 Vetinari spun around and began his absent-minded walk along the length of the table again. \u0027Well, mostly from you, madam, though I have to say that the credit is not all yours, since I have had an extended period of further education as tyrant of this city.\u0027 \u0027I think you allow them too much freedom.\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes, I do. That\u0027s why I am still tyrant of this city. The way to retain power, I have always thought, is to ensure the absolute unthinkability of oneself not being there. I shall help you in any way I can, of course. There should be no slaves, even slaves to instinct.\u0027 \u0027One person can make a difference,\u0027 said Margolotta. \u0027Look at Mister Shine who is now Diamond King of Trolls. Look at yourself. If men can fall - \u0027 Vetinari gave a sharp laugh. \u0027Oh, they can, indeed.\u0027 \u0027 - then orcs can rise,\u0027 said Margolotta. \u0027If that is not true then the universe is not true.\u0027 There was a velvet-like knock at the double doors and Drumknott entered. \u0027Mister Nutt is here, sir.\u0027 He added with a certain disdain, \u0027And he\u0027s with that... woman, who cooks in the university.\u0027 Vetinari glanced at Margolotta. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027I think we should see him in the main hall.\u0027 Drumknott coughed. \u0027I think I should tell you, sir, that Mister Nutt acquired entrance to the building through gates that were securely locked.\u0027 \u0027Did he tear them off their hinges?\u0027 asked Vetinari with apparent enthusiastic interest. \u0027No, sir, he lifted the gates bodily off their hinges and stacked them neatly against the wall.\u0027 \u0027Ah, then there is still hope for the world.\u0027 \u0027And the guards?\u0027 Drumknott glanced for a moment at Lady Margolotta. \u0027I have taken the precaution of stationing some of them inconspicuously in the Great Hall gallery with crossbows.\u0027 \u0027Stand them down,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Stand them down?\u0027 said Margolotta. \u0027Stand them down,\u0027 said Vetinari again, directly to Drumknott. He extended his arm to her ladyship. \u0027I think the term is, as they put it, alea iacta est. The die, your ladyship, is cast, and we should both see how it falls.\u0027 \u0027Will you get into trouble for that?\u0027 said Glenda, staying close to Nutt as they walked up the steps. The main hall of the palace was an intimidating place when empty, because it had been designed for exactly that purpose. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you just knock like everyone else?\u0027 \u0027My dear Glenda, I am not like anyone else and neither are you.\u0027 \u0027Then what are you going to do?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. What will Ladyship do? I have no idea, although I am becoming aware of how she thinks and there are a few possibilities I have in mind.\u0027 They watched two figures coming down the broad staircase that extended up into the rest of the building. It had been built to accommodate hundreds; the two people coming down looked uncharacteristically small. \u0027Ah, Mister Nutt,\u0027 said Vetinari as they had almost reached the bottom step, \u0027and Miss Sugarbean. I must add my congratulations to the pair of you on the wonderful, albeit surprising, success of Unseen Academicals.\u0027 \u0027I think you are going to have to make a lot of changes to the rules, sir,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Such as?\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027I think you need assistants for the referee. His eyes can\u0027t be everywhere,\u0027 said Nutt, \u0027and there do need to be some more rules. Although Mister Hoggett did the honourable thing, I think.\u0027 \u0027And Professor Rincewind might make a very capable attacker, if only you could persuade him to take the ball with him,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027I would never tell the Archchancellor this, my lord, but I think he may be better in a more defensive role.\u0027 \u0027Who would you suggest as an alternative?\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Well, Charlie, the animated skeleton who works in the Department of Post-Mortem Communications, did very well in trials. And, after all,\u0027 he paused for a moment, \u0027yes, after all, none of us can help how we\u0027re made.\u0027 They turned at a tap, tap, tapping behind them. It was Lady Margolotta\u0027s foot. Nutt gave a little bow. \u0027Ladyship. I trust I find you in adequate health.\u0027 \u0027And you likewise, Nutt,\u0027 said Lady Margolotta. Nutt turned to Glenda. \u0027What was that term you used once?\u0027 \u0027In the pink,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Yes, that\u0027s right, I am deeply in the pink,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027And it\u0027s Mister Nutt, if you please, your ladyship.\u0027 \u0027Would the two of you care to join us upstairs for a late supper?\u0027 asked Vetinari, watching them both very carefully. \u0027No, I don\u0027t think we will impose, but thank you very much. I have a lot to do. Lady Margolotta?\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027Would you come here, please?\u0027 Glenda watched the expressions: Vetinari\u0027s faint smile, her look of affront, Nutt\u0027s confidence. The rustle of her long, black dress was an audible intoxication as she walked the last few steps towards the orc and stopped. \u0027Do I have worth?\u0027 asked Nutt. \u0027Yes, Nutt, you do.\u0027 \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Nutt, \u0027but I am learning that worth is something that must be continuously accumulated. You asked me to be becoming. Have I become?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Nutt, you have become.\u0027 \u0027And what is it you want me to do now?\u0027 \u0027Find the orcs that still live in Far Uberwald and bring them back out of the dark.\u0027 \u0027Then there are more orcs, like me?\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027A few dozen, perhaps,\u0027 said Margolotta, \u0027but in truth I could hardly say they are like you. They are a sorry bunch.\u0027 \u0027Is it they who should be sorry?\u0027 said Nutt. Glenda watched the faces. Amazingly, Lady Margolotta looked taken aback. \u0027Many bad things were done under the Evil Empire,\u0027 she said. \u0027The best we can do now is undo them. Will you assist in this endeavour?\u0027 \u0027In every way that I can,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I would like you to teach them civilized behaviour,\u0027 said Ladyship coldly. He appeared to consider this. \u0027Yes, of course, I think that would be quite possible,\u0027 he said. \u0027And who would you send to teach the humans?\u0027 There was a brief outburst of laughter from Vetinari, who immediately cupped his hand over his mouth. \u0027Oh, I do beg your pardon,\u0027 he said. \u0027But since it falls to me,\u0027 continued Nutt, \u0027then, yes, I shall go into Far Uberwald.\u0027 \u0027Pastor Oats will be very pleased to see you, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said Margolotta. \u0027He\u0027s still alive?\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Oh, yes, indeed, he is still quite young after all, and walks with forgiveness at his side. I think he would feel it very appropriate if you were to join him. In fact, he has told me on one of his all too infrequent visits that he would be honoured to pass the rate of forgiveness on to you.\u0027 \u0027Nutt doesn\u0027t need forgiveness!\u0027 Glenda burst out. Nutt smiled and patted her hand. \u0027Uberwald is a wild country for a man to travel in,\u0027 he said, \u0027even a holy man. Forgiveness is the name of Pastor Oats\u0027s double-headed battle-axe. For Mister Oats the crusade against evil is not a metaphor. Forgiveness cut through my chains. I will gladly carry it.\u0027 \u0027The kings of the trolls and the dwarfs will give you all the help that they can,\u0027 said Ladyship. Nutt nodded. \u0027But first I have a small favour to ask you, my lord,\u0027 he said to Vetinari. \u0027By all means, ask.\u0027 \u0027I know the city has a number of golem horses. I wonder if I could borrow one of them?\u0027 \u0027Be my guest,\u0027 said the Patrician. Nutt turned to Glenda. \u0027Miss Sugarbean. Juliet told me that you secretly want to ride through Quirm on a warm summer\u0027s evening, feeling the wind in your hair. We could leave now. I have saved money.\u0027 All kinds of reasons why she shouldn\u0027t foamed in Glenda\u0027s head. Everywhere were responsibilities, commitments and the never-ending clamour of wanting. There were a thousand and one reasons why she should say no. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027In that case, then, we will not take up any more of your valuable time, my lord, my lady, and will head off to the stables.\u0027 \u0027But - \u0027 Lady Margolotta began. \u0027I think all that needs to be said has been,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I will, we will, of course, visit you shortly when I have settled my affairs here and I look forward very much to doing so.\u0027 He nodded to them and, with Glenda walking on air beside him, went back the way they had come. \u0027Wasn\u0027t that nice?\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027Did you see that they held hands all the time?\u0027 At the doorway, Nutt turned round. \u0027Oh, just one more thing. Thank you for not posting archers up in the gallery. That would have been so... embarrassing.\u0027 \u0027I shall drink to your success, Margolotta,\u0027 said Vetinari as their footsteps died away. \u0027You know, I seriously intended to proposition Miss Sugarbean to be my cook.\u0027 He sighed again. \u0027Still, what is a pie to a happy ending?\u0027 You think it\u0027s all over? The following morning Ponder Stibbons was at work in the High Energy Magic Building when Ridcully limped in. There was a glowing silver band around his knee. \u0027Grapeshot\u0027s Therapeutic Squeezer,\u0027 he announced. \u0027A simple little spell. I\u0027ll be right as rain in no time. Mrs Whitlow wanted me to put a stocking on it, but I told her that I\u0027m not interested in that sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m glad to see that you\u0027re in such good spirits, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder, working his way down a long calculation. \u0027Have you had a chance to see the papers yet this morning, Mister Stibbons?\u0027 \u0027No, sir. What with the football business, I\u0027m a little behind with my work.\u0027 \u0027It may interest you to know that late last night a seventy-foot-high chicken broke out of what they are pleased to call the Higher Energy Magic Building at Brazeneck and is apparently rampaging through Pseudopolis while being pursued by most of the faculty, who, I assume, would be quite capable of terrorizing the city all by themselves. Henry has just had a frantic clacks and has had to rush off.\u0027 \u0027Oh, that is very disturbing, sir.\u0027 \u0027Yes, it is, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Apparently it\u0027s laying eggs very fast.\u0027 \u0027Ah, that sounds like a quasi-expansion blit phenomenon adapting itself to a living organism,\u0027 said Ponder. He turned the page, his pencil moving neatly across the column of figures. \u0027The former Dean has egg all over his face,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Well, I\u0027m sure that Professor Turnipseed will be able to bring things back under control,\u0027 said Ponder. The tone of his voice was entirely unchanged. There was a busy little silence and Ridcully said, \u0027How long do you think we should give him to get it under control?\u0027 \u0027What size are the eggs?\u0027 \u0027Eight or nine feet high, apparently,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027With calcium shells?\u0027 \u0027Yes, quite thick, so I\u0027m told.\u0027 Ponder looked thoughtfully at the ceiling. \u0027Hmm, that\u0027s not too bad, then. If you\u0027d said steel it would have been rather worrying. It sounds very much like a blit devolution, possibly caused by... lack of experience.\u0027 \u0027I thought you taught Mister Turnipseed everything you know,\u0027 said Ridcully, looking happier than Ponder had seen him in a very long time. \u0027Well, sir, perhaps there was something he didn\u0027t quite grasp. Are people at risk?\u0027 \u0027The wizards have told everyone to stay indoors.\u0027 \u0027Well, sir, I think if I got some of my equipment together we could leave about teatime.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll come, too, of course,\u0027 said Ridcully. He looked at Ponder. \u0027And - \u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 said Ponder. He looked at Ridcully\u0027s grin. \u0027Yes, it might be a good idea if one of the gentlemen from the Times came along to take pictures. They might be very good for instructional purposes.\u0027 \u0027An extremely good plan, Mister Stibbons, and I think we should take the senior faculty as well. They will lend some much-needed... \u0027 He snapped his fingers. \u0027What\u0027s the word?\u0027 \u0027Confusion,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027No, not that,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Appetite?\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Weight?\u0027 \u0027Something like that... Ah, gravitas. Oh, yes, lots of gravitas. We aren\u0027t the kind of fellows who run around chasing strange birds. I\u0027ll see you after lunch. And now I have other matters to deal with.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Oh, and, um... What about the proposed football match?\u0027 \u0027Regrettably, it appears that it will have to wait until they have rebuilt the university.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a shame, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder. He carried on with the calculation until the very last figures danced into place, made sure the Archchancellor had left, gave a very small smile, which you might not have noticed had you not expected it, and then pulled another ledger towards him. It was another good day. It is now!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-20.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many thingsâwisdom, magic, and their love of teatimeâbut athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sportâsoccer with a bit of rugby thrown inâso popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about footballâthe most important thing about footballâis that it is never just about football.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
