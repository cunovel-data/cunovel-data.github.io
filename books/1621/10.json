{"id":94960,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u0027Have you been hit on the head with something?\u0027 said Stronginthearm. \u0027Because, if so, I\u0027d like it to drop on me.\u0027\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s spreading the dream, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Glenda, carefully arranging the samples in her suitcase. \u0027It\u0027s a bit more important than I thought.\u0027\n She made fourteen more successful calls before calling it a day, posted the orders through Stronginthearm\u0027s letterbox and, with a light case and uncharacteristically light heart, went back to work.\n Ridcully turned the corner and there, right in front of him, was... His mind spun as it sought for the correct mode of address: \u0027Archchancellor\u0027 was out of the question, \u0027Dean\u0027 too obvious an insult, \u0027Two Chairs\u0027 ditto with knobs on, and \u0027ungrateful, backstabbing, slimy bastard\u0027 took too long to say. What the hell was the bastard\u0027s name? Great heavens, they\u0027d been friends since their first day at UU... \u0027Henry!\u0027 he exploded. \u0027What a pleasant surprise. What brings you here to our miserable and sadly out-of-date little university?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, come now, Mustrum. When I left, the lads were pushing back the boundaries of knowledge. It\u0027s been a bit quiet since, I gather. By the way, this is Professor Turnipseed.\u0027\n There appeared from behind the self-styled Archchancellor of Brazeneck, like a moonlet moving out of the shadow of a gas giant, a sheepish young man who instantly reminded Ridcully of Ponder Stibbons, although for the life of him he couldn\u0027t make out why. Perhaps it was the look of someone permanently doing sums in his head, and not just proper sums either, but the sneaky sort with letters in them.\n \u0027Oh, well, you know how it is with boundaries,\u0027 Ridcully mumbled. \u0027You look at what\u0027s on the other side and you realize why there was a boundary in the first place. Good afternoon, Turnipseed. Your face is familiar.\u0027\n \u0027I used to work here, sir,\u0027 said Turnipseed sheepishly.\n \u0027Oh yes, I recall. In the High Energy Magic Department, yes?\u0027\n \u0027A coming man, our Adrian,\u0027 said the former Dean, proprietorially. \u0027We have our own High Energy Magic Building now, you know. We call it the Higher Energy Magic Building, but I stress that this is only to avoid confusion. No slight on good old UU is intended. Adopt, adapt, improve, that\u0027s my motto.\u0027\n Well, if you adapted it then it\u0027s now grab, copy and look innocent, Ridcully thought, but carefully. Senior wizards never rowed in public. The damage was apt to be appalling. No, politeness ruled, but with sharpened edges.\n \u0027I doubt there will be any confusion, Henry. We are the senior college, after all. And of course I am the only Archchancellor in these parts.\u0027\n \u0027By custom and practice, Mustrum, and times are changing.\u0027\n \u0027Or being changed, at least. But I wear the Archchancellor\u0027s Hat, Henry, as worn by my predecessors down the centuries. The Hat, Henry, of supreme authority in the affairs of the Wise, the Cunning and the Crafty. The hat, in fact, on my head.\u0027\n \u0027It isn\u0027t, you know,\u0027 said Henry cheerfully. \u0027You are wearing the everyday hat that you made yourself.\u0027\n \u0027It would be on my head if I wanted it to be!\u0027\n Henry\u0027s smile was glassy. \u0027Of course, Mustrum, but the authority of the Hat has often been challenged.\u0027\n \u0027Almost correct, old chap. In fact, it is the ownership of the Hat that has, in the past, been disputed, but the Hat itself, never. Now, I note that you yourself are wearing a particularly spiffy hat of a magnificence that goes beyond the sublime, but it is just a hat, old boy, just a hat. No offence meant, of course, and I am sure that in another millennium it will have become weighted with dignity and wisdom. I can see that you have left plenty of room.\u0027\n Turnipseed decided to make a run for the lavatories right now, and with a muted apology pushed past Ridcully and sped away.\n Oddly enough, the sudden lack of an audience lowered the tension rather than increased it.\n Henry pulled a slim packet out of his pocket. \u0027Cigarette? I know that you roll your own, but Verdant and Scour make these specially for me and they are rather fine.\u0027\n Ridcully took one, because a wizard, however haughty, who would not accept a free smoke or a drink would be in his coffin, but he took care not to notice the words \u0027Archchancellor\u0027s Choice\u0027 in garish type on the packet.\n As he handed the packet back, something small and colourful dropped out on to the floor. Henry, with an agility unexpected in a wizard so far up the main sequence as described in the well-known Owlspring/Tips Diagram, reached down quickly and snatched it up, muttering something about \u0027not letting it get dirty\u0027.\n \u0027You could eat your dinner off these floors,\u0027 said Ridcully sharply, and probably would, he added to himself.\n \u0027Only the collectors get so annoyed if there is a speck of dust on them and I give mine to the butler\u0027s little boy,\u0027 Henry went on blithely. He turned the pasteboard over and frowned. \u0027Notable Wizards of our Time, No. 9 of 50: Dr Able Baker, BC (Hons), Fdl, Kp, PdF (escrow), Director of Blit Studies, Brazeneck. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s already got this one.\u0027 He dropped it into a waistcoat pocket. \u0027Never mind, good for swapsies.\u0027\n Ridcully could assess things quite fast, especially when fuelled by banked fires of rage.\n \u0027The Wizla tobacco, snuff and rolling paper company,\u0027 he said, \u0027of Pseudopolis. Hmm, clever idea. Who\u0027s in this from UU?\u0027\n \u0027Ah. Well, I have to admit that the Assembly and people of Pseudopolis are rather... patriotic in their outlook - \u0027\n \u0027I think the word is \"parochial\", don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Harsh words, considering that Ankh-Morpork\u0027s the smuggest, most self-satisfied city in the world.\u0027 This was self-evidently true, so Ridcully decided he hadn\u0027t heard it.\n \u0027You on one of these cards, then?\u0027 he grunted.\n \u0027They insisted, I\u0027m afraid,\u0027 said Henry. \u0027I was born there, you see. Local boy and all that.\u0027\n \u0027And no one from UU,\u0027 said Ridcully flatly.\n \u0027Technically no, but Professor Turnipseed is in there as the inventor of Pex.\u0027 As Henry said it, guilt and defiance fought for space in the sentence.\n \u0027Pex?\u0027 said Ridcully slowly. \u0027You mean like Hex?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, no, not at all like Hex. Certainly not. The principle is quite different.\u0027 Henry cleared his throat. \u0027It\u0027s run by chickens. They trigger the morphic resonator, or whatever it\u0027s called. Your Hex, as I recall, utilizes ants, which are far less efficient.\u0027\n \u0027How so?\u0027\n \u0027We get eggs we can eat.\u0027\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t sound all that different, you know.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, come now. They are hundreds of times bigger! And Pex is in a purpose-built room, not strung haphazardly all over the place. Professor Turnipseed knows what he is doing, and even you, Mustrum, must acknowledge that the river of progress is fed by a thousand springs!\u0027\n \u0027And they didn\u0027t all rise in bloody Brazeneck!\u0027 said Ridcully.\n They glared at one another. Professor Turnipseed poked his head around the corner and pulled it back very quickly.\n \u0027If we were the men our fathers were, we\u0027d be throwing fireballs by now,\u0027 said Henry.\n \u0027The point is taken,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Although, I must point out, our fathers were not wizards.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right, of course,\u0027 said the former Dean. \u0027Your father was a butcher, as I recall.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. And your father owned a lot of cabbage fields,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n There was a moment\u0027s silence and then the former Dean said, \u0027Remember the day we both turned up at UU?\u0027\n \u0027We fought like tigers as I recall,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Good times, when you come to remember them,\u0027 said the Dean.\n \u0027Of course, we\u0027ve all passed a lot of water over the bridge since then,\u0027 said Ridcully. There was another pause and he added, \u0027Fancy a drink?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t mind if I do,\u0027 said the former Dean.\n \u0027So you are trying to play football?\u0027 said Henry as they progressed majestically towards the Archchancellor\u0027s office. \u0027I did see something about it in the paper, but I thought it was a joke.\u0027\n \u0027Why, pray?\u0027 said Ridcully as they began to walk across the Great Hall. \u0027We have a fine sporting tradition, as well you know!\u0027\n \u0027Ah yes, tradition is the scourge of endeavour. Be sensible, Mustrum. The leopard may change his shorts, but I think he\u0027d have a job getting into the ones he wore forty years ago. Oh, I see that you still have Mister Stibbons here?\u0027\n \u0027Er... \u0027 began Ponder, looking from one to the other.\n Ponder Stibbons had once got one hundred per cent in a prescience exam by getting there the previous day. He could see a little storm cloud when it was beginning to grow.\n \u0027How\u0027s the football going, lad?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, it seems to be going very well, Archchancellor. Good to see you again, Dean.\u0027\n \u0027Archchancellor,\u0027 purred the former Dean. \u0027I wonder how good you would be against my university.\u0027\n \u0027Well, we have a pretty nifty team built here,\u0027 said Ridcully, \u0027and, while it is our intention to play our first game against a local side, I would take great pleasure in showing Brazeneck a thing or two on the field.\u0027 By now they were almost in the middle of the Great Hall and their presence, not unexpectedly, had stopped play.\n \u0027Archchancellor, I really feel that it might be a good idea to - \u0027 Ponder began, but his voice was drowned out by the roar of approval that rang out from all sides around the Great Hall.\n \u0027And the prize would be?\u0027 said Henry, smiling at the crowd.\n \u0027What?\u0027 spluttered the Archchancellor. \u0027What prize?\u0027\n \u0027We picked up a few rowing trophies when we were lads, didn\u0027t we?\u0027\n \u0027I believe the Patrician has got something planned for the league, yes.\u0027\n \u0027I think that refreshments will be laid out in the Blue refectory shortly,\u0027 said Ponder with a kind of desperate, sweaty cheerfulness. \u0027There will, of course, be cake, but also, I believe, an interesting assortment of curries.\u0027\n On many occasions this might have worked, but the two senior wizards had locked glares and would not so much as blink, even for a slice of Ploughman\u0027s Pie.\n \u0027But we men of craft are not interested in such paltry baubles as cups and medals, are we?\u0027 said Henry. \u0027For us it\u0027s huge great big baubles or nothing, is that not right, Mustrum?\u0027\n \u0027You are after the Hat,\u0027 said Ridcully flatly. The air between them was humming.\n \u0027Yes, of course.\u0027\n There followed the menacing silence of a clash of wills, but Ponder Stibbons decided that as he was, technically, twelve important people at the university, he formed, all by himself, a committee, and since he was therefore, de facto, very wise, he should intervene.\n \u0027And your stake, Dea - Sir, would be... ?\u0027\n Ridcully turned his head slightly and growled, \u0027He doesn\u0027t have to have one. I have rather walked into this... \u0027\n There was a stirring from the more senior wizards, and Ponder heard a whispered phrase. \u0027Dead man\u0027s pointy shoes?\u0027\n \u0027No, I forbid it!\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027You forbid it?\u0027 said Henry. \u0027You are but a chick, young Stibbons.\u0027\n \u0027The accumulated votes of all the posts I hold on the University Council mean that I do, technically, control it,\u0027 said Ponder, trying to stick out a skinny chest that was never built for sticking, but still buoyed up and awash with righteous rage and a certain amount of terror about what might happen when it ran out of steam.\n The contenders relaxed a little more in the presence of this turning worm.\n \u0027Didn\u0027t anyone notice that you were getting all this power?\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Yes, sir, me. Only I thought it was responsibility and hard work. None of you ever bother with details, you see. Technically, I have to report to other people, but usually the other people are me. You have no idea, sirs. I\u0027m even the Camerlengo, which means that if you drop dead, Archchancellor, from any cause other than legitimate succession under the Dead Man\u0027s Pointy Shoes tradition, I run this place until a successor is elected which, given the nature of wizardry, will mean a job for life, in which case the Librarian, as an identifiable and competent member of the senior staff, will try to discharge his duties, and if he fails, the official procedure is for wizards everywhere to fight among themselves for the Hat, causing fire, destruction, doves, rabbits and billiard balls to appear from every orifice and much loss of life.\u0027 After a short pause he continued. \u0027Again. Which is why some of us get a little worried when we see powerful wizards squabbling like this. To conclude, gentlemen, I have spoken at some length in order to give you time to consider your intentions. Somebody has to.\u0027\n Ridcully cleared his throat. \u0027Thank you for your input, Stibbons. We shall discuss this matter further. Definitely something that needed to be said. These aren\u0027t the old days, after all.\u0027\n \u0027Your point is taken,\u0027 said Henry, \u0027except that, technically, these are going to be somebody else\u0027s old days.\u0027\n Ponder\u0027s chest was still going up and down.\n \u0027A very good point,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027I believe I heard mention of a curry?\u0027 said Henry, with equal care. It was like listening to two ancient dragons talking to each other with the help of an even older book of etiquette written by nuns.\n \u0027It\u0027s a long time until lunch. I tell you what, why don\u0027t you accept the hospitality of my university? I believe we have left your room exactly as it was, although I understand some quite amazing things have crawled out under the door. And perhaps you might like to stay on for tomorrow\u0027s banquet?\u0027\n \u0027Oh? Are you having a banquet?\u0027 said Henry.\n \u0027Indeed so, and I would be delighted if you would accept, old boy. We\u0027ll be entertaining some of the solid citizenry. Salt-of-the-earth fellows, you understand. Wonderful people if you don\u0027t watch them eat, but quite good conversationalists if you give them enough beer.\u0027\n \u0027Funnily enough, I find that works with wizards too. Well, I must accept, of course. I haven\u0027t been to a banquet in ages.\u0027\n \u0027You haven\u0027t?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027I thought you would have a banquet every night.\u0027\n \u0027We have a limited budget, you know,\u0027 said the Archchancellor of Brazeneck. \u0027It\u0027s a governmental grant thing, you see.\u0027\n The wizards fell silent. It was as if a man had just told you his mother had died.\n Ridcully patted him on the hand. \u0027Oh, I\u0027m so sorry.\u0027 He paused at the doors of the Hall and turned back to Ponder. \u0027We will be having some high-level discussions, Stibbons. Keep them on their toes! The lads will help! Find out what football wants to be!\u0027\n The older members of the faculty exhaled as the two heads left. Most of them were old enough to recall at least two pitched battles among factions of wizards, the worst of which had only been brought to a conclusion by Rincewind, wielding a half-brick in a sock...\n Ponder looked across at Rincewind now, and he was hopping awkwardly on one leg, trying to put a sock back on. He thought it better not to comment. It was probably the same sock.\n The Chair of Indefinite Studies slapped Ponder on the back. \u0027Well done, lad. Could have been a nasty incident there.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you, sir.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry we seem to have loaded you down a bit. I\u0027m sure it wasn\u0027t deliberate.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sure it wasn\u0027t, too, sir. Very little around here is.\u0027 Ponder sighed. \u0027I\u0027m afraid that unthinking delegation and prevarication and procrastination are standard practice here.\u0027 He looked expectantly at the remaining members of the Council. He wanted to be disappointed, but knew he wouldn\u0027t be.\n \u0027A very bad state of affairs indeed,\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes.\n The Chair looked grave. \u0027Hm... \u0027\n So go on, thought Ponder, say it. I know you\u0027re going to, you just won\u0027t be able to stop yourself, you really won\u0027t -\n \u0027I think, Stibbons, that you should sort it out when you have a moment,\u0027 said the Chair.\n \u0027Bingo!\u0027\n \u0027I beg your pardon, Stibbons?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, nothing, sir, not really. I was just pondering, as it were, on the unchangeable nature of the universe.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m glad somebody is. Keep it up.\u0027 The Lecturer in Recent Runes looked around and added, \u0027It all seems to have quietened down. That curry sounds amusing.\u0027\n There was a general movement towards the doors on the part of those wizards who were well endowed with years, gravitation or both, but the scratch match went on among those less magnetically attracted to knives and forks.\n Ponder sat down, his clipboard balanced on his lap. \u0027I don\u0027t have the faintest idea what I\u0027m doing here,\u0027 he declared to the world around him.\n \u0027May I be of some worth, sir?\u0027\n \u0027Mister Nutt? Oh, well, it\u0027s very kind of you, but I don\u0027t think that your skill with a candle can be of much - \u0027\n \u0027In games of this nature there are three classes of things to be considered: one, the rules of the game in all their detail; two the correct skills, actions and philosophies required for success, and three, an understanding of the real nature of the game. May I continue?\u0027\n \u0027Huh,\u0027 said Ponder, in that slight daze that overcame everyone hearing a Nutt lecture for the first time.\n \u0027Got a fine jaw on him, ain\u0027t he?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027He can say the long words where the likes of you an\u0027 me would \u0027ave to stop for a rest \u0027alfway through! Me, anyway,\u0027 he trailed off.\n \u0027Er, do continue, Mister Nutt.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you, sir. As I understand it, the purpose of this game is to score at least one more goal than your opponents. But our two teams just ran around, with everyone trying to kick the ball at once. Oh, goals were scored, but only opportunistically. As in chess, you must secure the king, your goal. Yes, you are going to say that you have the custodian of the goal, but he is only one man, figuratively speaking. Every ball he saves shames the team members who let the opponents get so close. Yet at the same time, they must maximize their chances of getting the ball into the opposing goal. This is a problem I will have to address. I have mentioned chess, but this game, and particularly the ease with which the ball takes flight, means that the activity can go from one end of the play to the other in seconds, just as one dwarf piece can upset the whole board in a game of Thud.\u0027\n He smiled up at their expressions and added, \u0027You know, this game is surely one of the simplest. Any little boy knows how to play it... and yet playing it optimally requires superhuman talents.\u0027 He thought for a moment and added, \u0027Or possibly subhuman. Certainly the willing sublimation of the ego, which takes us into the realms of the metaphysical. So simple and yet so complex. You know, this is wonderful. I am quite thrilled!\u0027\n The ring of silence around him was not ominous, but the air choked with bafflement. Finally, the wizard Rincewind said, \u0027Er, Mister Nutt, I thought you told us we just had to get the ball between the pointy hats?\u0027\n \u0027Professor Rincewind, you run very well, but you don\u0027t do anything with it. Professor Macarona, you attempt to score as soon as you get the ball irrespective of anything else that is happening. Dr Hix, you cheat and foul constantly - \u0027\n \u0027Excuse me, skull ring,\u0027 Hix intervened. \u0027I am required to attempt to break the rules, under college statutes.\u0027\n \u0027Within acceptable limits,\u0027 Ponder added quickly.\n \u0027Bledlow Nobbs (no relation), you have a furiously powerful kick,\u0027 Nutt continued, \u0027but you don\u0027t seem to care where the ball goes so long as it gets there. All of you have strengths and weaknesses and it might be possible to make use of both of them. That is, if you want to win. But for now, a good exercise would be to get a lot more of these balls and learn how to control them. Running while kicking the ball ahead of you simply means that you will lose it to an opponent. You must learn to keep it at your feet. You were all looking down to check that you had the ball. Gentlemen, if you need to check that you still have the ball, you either do not have it or you will lose it in the next fraction of a second. Now, if you will excuse me, Mister Trev and I will get into trouble if we don\u0027t get the chandelier back up soon.\u0027\n The spell broke.\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027I mean, what? Stay there, Mister Nutt!\u0027\n Nutt immediately hunched and stared at his feet in their clumsy shoes. \u0027I am sorry if I have transgressed in any way. I was only seeking worth.\u0027\n \u0027Worth?\u0027 said Ponder, looking at Trev for some kind of map of this new territory.\n \u0027That\u0027s how he talks, that\u0027s all,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027He \u0027asn\u0027t done anythin\u0027 wrong, so why shout at him like that? They were some bloody good ideas! You shouldn\u0027t pick on \u0027im just \u0027cos he\u0027s small and talks posh.\u0027\n Nutt seemed noticeably taller a little while ago, Ponder thought. Is he really just hunched up? \u0027I wasn\u0027t exactly shouting at him,\u0027 he said. \u0027I just wondered what he\u0027s doing dribbling candles! I mean, I know that\u0027s what he\u0027s doing, but why?\u0027\n \u0027Ah, you have to have dribbled candles, sir,\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs (no relation), \u0027and to my mind, the dribbling has been particularly fine just lately. Often, when I\u0027m walking the corridors of a night, I think to myself - \u0027\n \u0027Good heavens, man, he\u0027s erudite! He radiates learning! He\u0027s a polymath!\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Are you saying he\u0027s too smart to be a candle dribbler?\u0027 said the bledlow, a militant look in his eye. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t want a stupid dribbler, would you? You\u0027d get, like, manky dribbles all over the place.\u0027\n \u0027I simply meant that - \u0027\n \u0027... and blobs,\u0027 said the bledlow firmly.\n \u0027But you must admit that it is strange that - \u0027\n Probably everyone wants him dead.\n Ponder stopped as the chasm of memory opened. \u0027That makes no sense. It can\u0027t be true!\u0027\n \u0027Sir?\u0027\n He realized that all the footballers were staring at him. Ridcully had refused to say any more, and in Ponder\u0027s crowded mind he\u0027d settled for believing that Nutt was on the run in some way. It was not unknown. Occasionally a novice wizard working in a small town might find it a good idea to hurry back for a swift refresher course in the safety of the university\u0027s hospitable stones until his little mistake had been rectified/forgotten/erased/caught and bottled. There had always been others given sanctuary for mysterious reasons. The politics of wizardry were either very simple, and resolved by someone ceasing to breathe, or as complex as one ball of yarn in a room with three bright-eyed little kittens.\n But Nutt... What crime could he have done? And then you had to factor in that it was Ridcully who had allowed him to come here and indeed had put Ponder in this position. The sensible thing, therefore, was to�Cjust get on with it.\n \u0027I think Mister Nutt has some very good ideas,\u0027 he said carefully, \u0027and I think he should continue. Do carry on, Mister Nutt.\u0027\n Watching Nutt look up was like watching the sun rise, but a hesitant sun afraid that any moment the gods might slap it back down into the night, and hungry for reassurance that this would not be so.\n \u0027I am worthy?\u0027\n \u0027Well, er... \u0027 Ponder began, and saw Trev nodding frantically.\n \u0027Well, er, yes, it would seem so, Mister Nutt. I\u0027m amazed at your insight in so short a time.\u0027\n \u0027I have a talent for pattern recognition in developing situations.\u0027\n \u0027Really? Oh. Good. Carry on, then.\u0027\n \u0027Excuse me, I have a question, if you would be so good?\u0027\n Looks like a bag of second-hand clothes, talks like a retired theologian, Ponder thought. \u0027Ask away, Mister Nutt.\u0027\n \u0027Can I carry on with the dribbling?\u0027\n \u0027What? Do you want to?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, thank you. I enjoy it and it does not take me long.\u0027\n Ponder glanced at Trev, who shrugged, made a face and nodded.\n \u0027But I have a favour to ask,\u0027 Nutt went on.\n \u0027I rather expected you would,\u0027 said Ponder, \u0027but I\u0027m sorry to say that the budget this term means - \u0027\n \u0027Oh no, I don\u0027t want any money,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I don\u0027t really spend it anyway. I just want Mister Trev in the team. He is very modest, but you should know that he is a genius with his feet. I cannot see how you could lose with him in the team.\u0027\n \u0027Oh no,\u0027 said Trev, waving his hands and backing away. \u0027No! Not me! I\u0027m not a footballer! I just kick tin cans around!\u0027\n \u0027Thought that was at the heart and soul of foot-the-ball, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Ponder, who\u0027d never been allowed to play in the street.\n \u0027I thought it was when early blokes kicked a dead enemy\u0027s head around,\u0027 Bledlow Nobbs (no relation) volunteered.\n A throat was cleared. \u0027Unlikely in my opinion,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027Unless it\u0027s in a bag or some sort of metal brace, and then you have the problem of weight, because a human head comes in at around ten pounds, which is a pain in the foot, I should think. Scooping it out would work for a while, of course, but mind you wire the jaw, because no one wants to be bitten in the foot. I do have some heads on ice if anyone wants to experiment. It\u0027s amazing, but there are still those who leave their bodies to necromancy. There\u0027s some strange people out there.\u0027\n At this point, the head of the Department of Post-Mortem Communications realized that he was not taking his audience with him.\n \u0027There\u0027s no need to look at me like that,\u0027 he grumbled. \u0027Skull ring, remember? I have to know this wretched stuff.\u0027\n Ponder coughed politely. \u0027Mister, er, Likely, isn\u0027t it? Your colleague speaks very highly of you. Won\u0027t you join us?\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, guv, but I promised my old mum that I\u0027d never play football. It\u0027s a good way of gettin\u0027 your head caved in!\u0027\n \u0027Trev Likely?\u0027 roared Bledlow Nobbs (no relation). \u0027Are you Dave Likely\u0027s lad? He - \u0027\n \u0027Scored four goals, yeah, yeah, yeah,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027And then died in the street with the rain washing his blood down the gutter and someone\u0027s smelly overcoat over him. The Prince of Football?\u0027\n \u0027Do we need a little talk, Mister Trev?\u0027 Nutt said urgently.\n \u0027No. No. I\u0027m okay. Okay?\u0027\n \u0027This isn\u0027t that kind of football, Trev,\u0027 said Nutt soothingly.\n \u0027Yeah, I know. But I promised my old mum.\u0027\n \u0027Then at least show them your moves, Mister Trev,\u0027 Nutt pleaded. He turned to the players. \u0027You must see this!\u0027\n Trev sighed, but Nutt knew just how to wheedle. \u0027All right, if it shuts you up,\u0027 he said, and pulled a tin can out of his pocket, to much laughter.\n \u0027See?\u0027 he complained to Nutt. \u0027They just think it\u0027s a joke.\u0027\n Nutt folded his arms. \u0027Show them.\u0027\n Trev dropped the can on to his foot and with hardly any effort flicked it on to his shoulder, where it rolled around his neck to his other shoulder and, after a tiny pause, righted itself. He shrugged it on to his other foot, spun it into the air, and let it tumble and spin on the toe of his boot with a faint rattling noise.\n Trev winked at Ponder Stibbons. \u0027Don\u0027t move, guv.\u0027\n The can sprang off the boot and up into the air, then, as it fell, he hit it with a roundhouse kick, driving it at Ponder. The people behind Ponder dived out of the way as it growled past his face and went into orbit, appearing for a moment to give him a silver necklace until it broke away and dropped into Trev\u0027s hand like a beached salmon.\n In the silence, Ponder pulled his thaumometer out of his pocket and glanced at it.\n \u0027Natural background,\u0027 he said flatly. \u0027No magic involved. How did you do that, Mister Likely?\u0027\n \u0027You just \u0027ave to get the hang of it, guv. Getting the spins is the thing, but if I \u0027ave to think too much it don\u0027t work.\u0027\n \u0027Can you do it with a ball?\u0027\n \u0027Dunno, never tried. But prob\u0027ly no. Can\u0027t get the long spin and the short spin, see? But you ort to be able to get somethin\u0027 out of a ball.\u0027\n \u0027But how would that help us?\u0027 said Hix.\n \u0027Mastery of the ball is everything,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027The planned rule will, I think, allow the keeper of the goal to handle the ball. This is vital. There is, however, no explicit ban on nodding the ball, kneeing the ball or blocking the ball with the chest and letting it drop neatly on to the foot. Remember, gentlemen, this ball flies. It will spend a lot of time in the air. You must learn not to think just about the ground.\u0027\n \u0027I feel sure that using the head would be considered illegal,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Sir, you presume a rule where there is none. Remember what I said about the real nature of the game.\u0027\n Ponder saw Nutt\u0027s little half-smile, and gave in. \u0027Mister Nutt, I am delegating the selection and training of our football team to you. You will report to me, of course.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I will need the power to sequester team members from their normal duties when required.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I suppose I must agree to that. Very well, I shall leave the team in your hands,\u0027 said Ponder, thinking: how many bags of old clothes use the word \u0027sequester\u0027 as if they\u0027re used to it? Still, Ridcully likes the little goblin, if that\u0027s what he is, and I\u0027ve never seen the point of team games.\n \u0027May I also, sir, request a very small budget?\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027With all due respect to the exigencies of university finances,\u0027 said Nutt, \u0027I believe it is very necessary.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027I wish to take the team to the ballet.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s ridiculous!\u0027 Ponder snapped.\n \u0027No, sir, it\u0027s essential.\u0027\n The next day there was a piece in the Times about the mysterious disappearance of the fabulous \u0027Jewels\u0027, which made Glenda smile. They just haven\u0027t read their fairy stories, she thought as she left the house. If you want to find a beauty, you look for her in the ashes. Because Glenda was Glenda and would always irredeemably be Glenda to the core, she added: although the ovens in the Night Kitchen are scrupulously maintained at all times and all ashes are immediately disposed of.\n To her surprise, Juliet stepped out of her doorway at almost the same time and looked as if she was almost awake. \u0027Do you think they\u0027ll let me in on the banquet?\u0027 she said as they waited for the bus.\n Theoretically yes, Glenda thought, but probably no, because she was a Night Kitchen girl. Even though she was Juliet, she would be tarred by Mrs Whitlow as a Night Kitchen girl. \u0027Juliet, you shall go to the banquet,\u0027 she said aloud, \u0027and so shall I.\u0027\n \u0027But I think Mrs Whitlow won\u0027t like that,\u0027 said Juliet.\n Something was still bubbling inside Glenda. It had started in Shatta and lasted all day yesterday and there was still some left today. \u0027I don\u0027t care,\u0027 she said.\n Juliet giggled and looked around in case Mrs Whitlow was hiding near the bus stop.\n And I really don\u0027t care, Glenda thought. I don\u0027t care. It was like drawing a sword.\n Ponder\u0027s office always puzzled Mustrum Ridcully. The man used filing cabinets for heavens\u0027 sake. Ridcully worked on the basis that anything you couldn\u0027t remember wasn\u0027t important and had developed the floor-heap method of document storage to a fine art.\n Ponder looked up. \u0027Ah, good morning, Archchancellor.\u0027\n \u0027Just had a look in at the Hall,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Yes, Archchancellor?\u0027\n \u0027Our lads were all doing ballet.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Archchancellor.\u0027\n \u0027And there were some girls from the Opera House with those short dresses.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Archchancellor. They\u0027re helping the team.\u0027\n Ridcully leaned over and put huge knuckles either side of the paper Ponder was working on. \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Mister Nutt\u0027s idea, Archchancellor. Apparently they must learn balance, poise and elegance.\u0027\n \u0027Have you ever seen Bledlow Nobbs try to stand on one leg? Let me tell you, it\u0027s an immediate cure for melancholy.\u0027\n \u0027I can imagine,\u0027 said Ponder, not looking up.\n \u0027I thought the idea was to learn how to kick the ball into the goal.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, yes, but Mister Nutt has a philosophy.\u0027\n \u0027Does he?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re runnin\u0027 about all over the place, I know that,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Yes, Mister Nutt and Mister Likely are preparing a little something extra for the banquet,\u0027 said Ponder, getting up and opening the top drawer of a filing cabinet. The sight of filing cabinets opening tended to remind Ridcully that he should be elsewhere, but on this occasion the ruse failed to work.\n \u0027Oh, and I believe we have some fresh balls.\u0027\n \u0027Mister Snorrisson knows an opportunity when he sees one.\u0027\n \u0027So it\u0027s all going well, then?\u0027 said Ridcully, in a kind of mystified voice.\n \u0027Apparently so, sir.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I suppose I\u0027d better leave it alone,\u0027 said Ridcully. He hesitated, feeling at a bit of a loose end, and found another thread to pull. \u0027And how are those rules coming along, Mister Stibbons?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, quite well, thank you, Archchancellor. I\u0027m keeping in some of the ones from the street game, of course, to keep everybody happy. Some of them are quite strange.\u0027\n \u0027Mister Nutt is quite a decent chap, it appears.\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes, Archchancellor.\u0027\n \u0027Very good idea of his to redesign the goal, I thought. Makes it more fun.\u0027\n \u0027Aren\u0027t you going to train, sir?\u0027 said Ponder, pulling another document towards him.\n \u0027I am the captain! I do not need to train.\u0027 Ridcully turned to leave and stopped with his hand on the doorknob. \u0027Had a long chat with the former Dean last night. Decent soul at heart, of course,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Yes, I understand the atmosphere in the Uncommon Room was very convivial, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder. And expensive, he added to himself.\n \u0027You know young Adrian Turnipseed is a professor?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes, Archchancellor.\u0027\n \u0027You wanna be one?\u0027\n \u0027Not really, Archchancellor. I think there should be one or two posts in this institution that I don\u0027t hold.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but they\u0027ve just called their machine Pex! Hardly a great leap of ingenuity, is it?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, there are some significant differences. I believe he\u0027s using chickens to generate the blit diametric,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Apparently so,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Something like that, anyway.\u0027\n \u0027Hmmm,\u0027 said Ponder. And it was quite a solid hmmm, possibly one you could moor a small boat to.\n \u0027Something wrong?\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Oh, er, not really, Archchancellor. Did the former Dean mention anything about the need to totally rebuild the morphic resonator to allow for the necessary changes in the blit/slood interface?\u0027\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Ponder, his face blank. \u0027Well, Adrian is bound to get round to that. He is very clever.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but it was all based on your work. You built Hex. And now they\u0027re putting out that he\u0027s some big clever clogs. He\u0027s even on a cigarette card.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s nice, sir. It\u0027s good when researchers get recognition.\u0027\n Ridcully felt like a mosquito that was trying to sting a steel breastplate. \u0027Hah, wizardry has certainly changed since my day,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said Ponder noncommittally.\n \u0027And by the way, Mister Stibbons,\u0027 said Ridcully as he opened the door, \u0027my day isn\u0027t over yet.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-10.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: \n Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) \n The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. \n Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever.
