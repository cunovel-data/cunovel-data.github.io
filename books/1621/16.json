{"id":94966,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u0027Did you know that all of the orcs were hunted down after the war? All of them, children too,\u0027 Nutt said.\\n\\n And people don\u0027t say things like that in a romantic situation, thought Glenda. But it still is, she added.\\n\\n \u0027But they were forced,\u0027 she replied. \u0027They had children. Okay?\u0027 Should I tell him about the magic mirror? she wondered. Would it make things better? Or worse?\\n\\n \u0027They were very bad times,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027Well, look at it like this,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Most of the people who talk about orcs now don\u0027t know what they\u0027re on about, but the only orc they are ever going to see is you. You making beautiful candles. You training the football team. That will mean a lot. You\u0027ll show them that orcs don\u0027t go around pulling people\u0027s heads off. That\u0027ll be something to be proud of.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, in fairness, I have to say that when I think of the amount of radial force that must have been necessary to effectively unscrew a human head against its owner\u0027s wishes, I am a little impressed. But that\u0027s now, sitting here with you. Then, I wanted to go up to the hills. I think that\u0027s how we must have survived. If you didn\u0027t keep away from humans you died.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s a very good point,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027but I think you should keep it to yourself for now.\u0027 She noticed a surprised owl, lit up briefly by the coach\u0027s lamps.\\n\\n Then she said, keeping her eyes straight ahead, \u0027The thing about the poem... \u0027\\n\\n \u0027How did you know, Miss Glenda?\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027You talk about kindness a lot.\u0027 She cleared her throat. \u0027And under the circumstances, I think Glenda is sufficient.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were kind to me,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027You are kind to everybody.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda swiftly put aside a vision of Mr Ottomy and said, \u0027No, I\u0027m not, I\u0027m shouting at everyone all the time!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but it\u0027s for their own good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do we do now?\u0027 Glenda said.\\n\\n \u0027I have no idea. But can I tell you something very interesting about ships?\u0027\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t exactly what Glenda had expected, but somehow it was one hundred per cent Nutt. \u0027Please tell me the interesting thing about ships,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027The interesting thing about ships is that the captains of ships have to be very careful when two ships are close together at sea, particularly in calm conditions. They tend to collide.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because of the wind blowing, and that?\u0027 said Glenda, thinking: In theory this is a romantic-novel situation and I am about to learn about ships. Iradne Comb-Buttworthy never puts a ship in her books. They probably don\u0027t have enough reticules.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027In fact, to put it simply, each ship shields the other ship from lateral waves on one side, so by small increments outside forces bring them together without their realizing it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh! It\u0027s a metaphor?\u0027 said Glenda, relieved. \u0027You think we\u0027re being pushed together.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s something like that,\u0027 said Nutt. They rocked as the coach hit a particularly nasty pothole.\\n\\n \u0027So, if we don\u0027t do anything we\u0027ll just get closer and closer?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n The coach jumped and rattled again, but Glenda felt as if she was travelling over very thin ice. She\u0027d hate to say the wrong thing.\\n\\n \u0027You know Trev said that I\u0027d died?\u0027 Nutt continued. \u0027Well, that was true. Probably. Ladyship said that we were made from goblins for the Evil Emperor. The Igors did it. And they put in something very strange. It\u0027s a part of you that isn\u0027t quite a part of you. They called it the Little Brother. It\u0027s tucked in deep inside and absolutely protected and it\u0027s like having your own hospital with you all the time. I know that I was hit very hard, but the Little Brother kept me alive and simply cured things again. There are ways to kill an orc, but there are not many of them and anyone trying them out on a living orc is not going to have very much time to get it right. Does that worry you at all?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not really,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I don\u0027t really understand it. I think it\u0027s more important just to be who you are.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t think I should be who I am, because I am an orc. But I have some plans in that direction.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda cleared her throat again. \u0027This thing with the ships... Does it happen quite quickly?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It starts quite slowly, but it\u0027s quite quick towards the end,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027The thing is,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027I mean, I can\u0027t just walk away from my job, and there\u0027s old ladies I go and visit, and you\u0027ll be busy with the football... \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. I think we should be doing the things we should be doing, and it\u0027s the last training day tomorrow, which is actually today now,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027And I\u0027ve got to make a lot of pies.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s going to be a very busy time for both of us,\u0027 said Nutt solemnly.\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Um, er, do you mind me saying... in your lovely poem... the line \"The crypt\u0027s a handsome place to be, but none I think leave after tea\" didn\u0027t quite - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t quite work? I know,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I feel rather bad about that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, please don\u0027t! It\u0027s a wonderful poem!\u0027 Glenda burst out, and felt the ripples in the calm sea.\\n\\n The rising sun managed to peek around the vast column of smoke that forever rose from Ankh-Morpork, City of Cities, illustrating almost up to the edge of space that smoke means progress or, at least, people setting fire to things. \u0027I think we\u0027re going to be so busy that we\u0027re not going to have much time for... ourselves,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027I quite agree,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Leaving things alone would definitely be our wisest move.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda felt light as air as the coach trundled down Broad Way, and it wasn\u0027t just from lack of sleep. That stuff about boats, I really hope he doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s all about ships.\\n\\n There was a crowd outside the university when they arrived, just as yesterday, but it seemed to have a different complexion now. People were staring at her and Nutt, and there was something wrong with the way they were looking.\\n\\n She reached over to the mound that was Trev, pretended not to hear a girlish giggle and said, \u0027Trev. Could you, er, have a look at this. I think there\u0027s going to be trouble.\u0027\\n\\n Trev, very tousled, stuck his head out and said, \u0027Hmm, me too. Let\u0027s all nip in around the back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We could stay on and get off at the Post Office,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027We \u0027aven\u0027t done anythin\u0027 wrong.\u0027\\n\\n As they dismounted from the coach a small boy said to Nutt, \u0027Are you the orc, mister?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Nutt, as he helped Glenda down. \u0027I am an orc.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cool! Have you ever twisted someone\u0027s head off?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe so. I am sure I would have remembered,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n This got if not applause then a certain amount of approval from some of the bystanders. It\u0027s his voice, thought Glenda. He sounds posher than a wizard. You can\u0027t imagine a voice like that with its hands around somebody\u0027s head.\\n\\n At this point the back gate opened and Ponder Stibbons came hurrying through. \u0027We saw you from the Hall,\u0027 he said, grabbing Nutt. \u0027Come in quick. Where have you all been?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We \u0027ad to go to Sto Lat,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027On business,\u0027 said Juliet.\\n\\n \u0027Personal,\u0027 said Glenda, daring Ponder to object. \u0027Is there something wrong?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There was something in the paper this morning. We have not been having a very nice time,\u0027 said Ponder, towing them into the relative safety of the undercrofts.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027ave they been sayin\u0027 somethin\u0027 nasty about Mister Nutt?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027Not exactly,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027The editor of the Times came round, in person, and was knocking on the door to see the Archchancellor at midnight. He wanted to know all about you.\u0027 This was said directly to Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027I bet it was bloody Ottomy that told them,\u0027 growled Glenda. \u0027What have they done?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, of course, you know there was all that trouble over the Medusa in the Watch a little while ago,\u0027 Ponder began.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but you wizards sorted that out,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027But no one likes being turned into stone, even if it\u0027s just for half an hour.\u0027 Ponder sighed. \u0027The Times has done one of their thoughtful pieces. I suppose it isn\u0027t too bad. It quoted the Archchancellor, who says that Mister Nutt is a hardworking member of the university staff and there have been no incidents of anyone\u0027s leg being torn off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They put it like that?\u0027 said Glenda, wide-eyed.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, you know the sort of thing if you read the papers a lot,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027I seriously think they think that it\u0027s their job to calm people down by first of all explaining why they should be overexcited and very worried.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes, I know they do that,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027How would people get worried if they weren\u0027t told how to be?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it wasn\u0027t all that bad,\u0027 said Ponder, \u0027but a few of the other papers have picked it up as well and some of the facts have become... elastic. The Inquirer said Nutt is training the football team.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s true,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027Well, actually it\u0027s me. I am merely delegating the task to him. I hope that\u0027s understood? Anyway, they did a cartoon about it.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda put a hand over her eyes. She hated cartoons in newspapers. \u0027Was it a football team of orcs?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Ponder\u0027s look was almost admiring. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027And they did an article about raising important questions about Vetinari\u0027s open-door policy, while saying at the same time that rumours that Mister Nutt had to be chained down were quite likely false.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about the Tanty Bugle?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027They never write anything unless it\u0027s got blood and horrible murder in it.\u0027 She paused and then added, \u0027Or pictures of girls without their vests on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027They did a rather grainy picture of a young lady with enormous melons.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027D\u0027you mean - \u0027 Trev began.\\n\\n \u0027No, they were just enormous melons. The green ones. Slightly warty. She won a contest for growing them, apparently, but in the caption it said that she\u0027s worried that she won\u0027t be able to sleep easily in her bed now that orcs are coming into the city.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is Lord Vetinari doing anything about this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I haven\u0027t heard,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Oh, and Bu-bubble want to interview Mister Nutt. What they call a lifestyle piece.\u0027 He said the words as if trying to hold them at arm\u0027s length.\\n\\n \u0027Have people turned up for training?\u0027 said Nutt calmly.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes. The ground is heaving.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So we\u0027ll go and train them,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t twist anybody\u0027s head off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, don\u0027t make jokes,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I think this could be terribly bad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We know something\u0027s going on with the teams,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027And there were lots of fights during the night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About who\u0027s going to play us.\u0027 Ponder stopped and looked Nutt up and down. \u0027Commander Vimes is back in town and would like to lock you up,\u0027 he said. \u0027Only in protective custody, of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mean put him somewhere where they can all find him?\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027I would say that the chances of a mob breaking into Pseudopolis Yard are remote,\u0027 said Ponder.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but you\u0027re locking him up. That\u0027s what it would be. He\u0027d be locked up and coppers chat like everyone else. The orc would be locked up in prison and if people don\u0027t know why, they\u0027ll make it up, that\u0027s how people are. Can\u0027t you wizards do something?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027We can do practically anything, but we can\u0027t change people\u0027s minds. We can\u0027t magic them sensible. Believe me, if it were possible to do that, we would have done it a long time ago. We can stop people fighting by magic and then what do we do? We have to go on using magic to stop them fighting. We have to go on using magic to stop them being stupid. And where does all that end? So we make certain that it doesn\u0027t begin. That\u0027s why the university is here. That\u0027s what we do. We have to sit around not doing things because of the hundreds of times in the past it\u0027s been proved that once you get beyond the abracadabra, hey presto, changing-the-pigeons-into-ping-pong-balls style of magic you start getting more problems than you\u0027ve solved. It was bad enough finding ping-pong balls nesting in the attics.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ping-pong balls nestin\u0027?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to talk about it,\u0027 said Ponder glumly.\\n\\n \u0027I remember when one of you gentlemen got hungry in the night and cast a spell for a baked potato,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n Ponder shuddered. \u0027That was the Bursar,\u0027 he said. \u0027He really does get confused about the decimal point.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I remember all those wheelbarrows,\u0027 said Glenda, slightly amused at Ponder\u0027s discomfort. \u0027Days and days it took to get them all out. I heard we were feeding every beggar in the city and every pig farm out as far as Sto Lat for weeks.\u0027\\n\\n Ponder nearly gave a harrumph. \u0027Well, yes, there\u0027s an example of why we have to be careful.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But there\u0027s still going to be a match tomorrow and I would like to conclude my training programme,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, there\u0027s another problem. You know Lord Vetinari is allowing the Hippo to be used for the game? Well, some of the teams are doing their training there now. You know, a bit of a kick-about, and so on. It\u0027s all about who will be playing Unseen Academicals.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s the other side of the city,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027Commander Vimes has said the Watch will provide an escort,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Just for protection, you know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whose?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You can see what\u0027s going on here. People will see Mister Nutt as the problem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s all fun and games until someone loses a head,\u0027 said a voice behind Glenda. She recognized that voice and it always sounded as if it was trying to put its hand up her jumper.\\n\\n \u0027Pepe? What the hell are you doing here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how did you get in?\u0027 Ponder demanded. \u0027The Watch are all around this place.\u0027\\n\\n Pepe barely gave him a glance. \u0027And who are you, smart boy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I run this university!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then I should go away and run it, because you\u0027re not going to be any good around here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is this�Cperson�Cknown to you, miss?\u0027 Ponder demanded.\\n\\n \u0027Er, yes. He, er, designs clothes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am a fashionista,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027I can do things with clothing that you wouldn\u0027t think were possible.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d believe that, at least,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027And I know a thing or two about riots and mobs.\u0027\\n\\n An idea struck Glenda and she whispered to the irate Ponder, \u0027Very big in dwarf circles, sir. Knows a lot of influential people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So do I,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Actually, I am one,\u0027 he wailed. \u0027But I had to do the training myself yesterday and I couldn\u0027t remember all of the things Mister Nutt comes up with so I had them running on the spot, which I don\u0027t think is very helpful.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s somethin\u0027 goin\u0027 bad,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I know about this city. I\u0027ll go and check a few things out. It\u0027s not as if you really need me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I do,\u0027 said Juliet.\\n\\n Trev hesitated, but Nutt had shown him how to do this. He extended a hand and blew her a kiss as he went through the door.\\n\\n \u0027Did you see that?\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027He blew me.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda looked at Pepe, whose eyes were turned up so far in his head that she could see the whites�Calthough they were red.\\n\\n A short while later, when most of the UU squad headed for the Hippo with Glenda and Juliet trailing after them like camp followers, half a dozen watchmen appeared from the various places that they had selected for a quiet smoke and fell in after them, trying to make it look as if they all just happened to be strolling in the same direction.\\n\\n Trev was right, Glenda thought. It is going bad.\\n\\n Trev had not gone very far when his street sense told him he was being followed. He jinked in and out of a few alleys and waited at the next corner to confront the follower... The follower who wasn\u0027t there. The alley behind him was empty all the way to the last street. He realized this at the same time as someone pressed what definitely felt like a knife to his neck.\\n\\n \u0027Cor, this takes me back and so it does,\u0027 said a voice. \u0027I reckon I can still remember every back alley in this place.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know you, it\u0027s Pepe, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027re a dwarf?\u0027 said Trev, trying not to turn round.\\n\\n \u0027Sort of a dwarf,\u0027 said Pepe.\\n\\n \u0027But I don\u0027t have no argument with you, do I?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n Something small and shiny appeared on the edge of Trev\u0027s vision. \u0027Sample piece of moonsilver,\u0027 said Pepe\u0027s voice. \u0027I could do more damage with a broken champagne bottle�Cand I have, believe you me. I wouldn\u0027t threaten a bloke like you with a knife, not with that little girl doting on you like she is. She seems very happy with you and I\u0027d like to keep her happy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Somethin\u0027s goin\u0027 down on the street,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027What, the whole street? Sounds like fun.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Somethin\u0027s gone wrong, \u0027asn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n Only now did Pepe enter his field of view. \u0027Not really my problem at all,\u0027 he said. \u0027But there\u0027re some kinds of people I just don\u0027t like. I\u0027ve seen too many of \u0027em, bullies and bastards. If you want to learn athletics very quickly, be born around here with a talent for design and maybe a few other little preferences. Lord Vetinari has got it all wrong. He thought he could take on the football and it\u0027s not working. It\u0027s not like the Thieves\u0027 Guild, see. He had it easy with the Thieves\u0027 Guild. That\u0027s because the Thieves\u0027 Guild is organized. Football ain\u0027t organized. Just because he\u0027s won over the captains don\u0027t mean that everyone\u0027s going to meekly get into line after them. There was fights all over the place last night. Your chums with their shiny new football and their shiny new jerseys are going to get creamed tomorrow. No, worse than creamed�Ccheesed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought you were just someone who made clothes?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027Just. Someone. Who. Made. Clothes. Just someone?! I am not anyone. I am Pepe and I don\u0027t make clothes. I create gorgeous works of art that just happen to require a body to show them off as they should be seen. Tailors and dressmakers make clothes. I forge history! Have you heard about micromail?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Got yer. Yep,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027Good,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Now, what have you heard about micromail?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it doesn\u0027t chafe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s got one or two other little secrets, too... \u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Anyway, I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve got any time for the wizards, myself. Snooty lot. But it\u0027s not going to be a game out there tomorrow, it\u0027s going to be a war. Do you know a bloke called Andy? Andy Shank?\u0027\\n\\n Trev\u0027s heart sank. \u0027What\u0027s he gotta do with it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I just heard the name, but I reckon I know the type. Lord Vetinari has done what he wanted. He\u0027s broken the football, but that\u0027s leaving a lot of sharp bits, if you get my meaning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Watch\u0027ll be there tomorrow,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s this? What\u0027s this? A street face like you being glad that the Watch is going to be anywhere?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027ll be a lot of people watching.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, won\u0027t that be fun?\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027And, you know, there\u0027s people in this city that would watch a beheading and hold their kiddies up for a better view. So I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027m not going to give you an edge, the last thing you\u0027ll want to see tomorrow is an edge. I\u0027ll give you something that\u0027s much better than an edge. After all, you\u0027re Dave Likely\u0027s lad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not playing,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I promised my ol\u0027 mum.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You promised your old mum?\u0027 said Pepe. There wasn\u0027t even any attempt to hide the disdain. \u0027And you think that makes any difference, do you? You\u0027ve got a star in your hand, lad. You\u0027ll play, all right, so I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. You come along and see me round the back entrance of Shatta, sorry about that, it sounds better in Dwarfish, and kick on the door round about midnight. You can bring a chum with you if you like, but you better bloody well come.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do I \u0027ave to kick the door?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027Because you\u0027ll have a bottle of best brandy in each hand. Don\u0027t thank me. I\u0027m not doing it for you. I\u0027m protecting my investment and, on the way, that means protecting yours as well. Off you go, boy. You\u0027re late for training. And me? I\u0027m a soddin\u0027 genius!\u0027\\n\\n Trev noticed more watchmen around as he headed onwards. They could be absolute bastards if they felt like it, but Sam Vimes had no use for coppers that couldn\u0027t read the streets. The Watch was jumpy.\\n\\n Carter used to live in his mum\u0027s cellar until she rented it out to a family of dwarfs, and now he lived in the attic, which baked in the summer and froze in the winter. Carter survived because the walls were insulated with copies of Bows \u0026 Ammo, Back Street Pins, Stanley Howler\u0027s Stamp Monthly, Giggles, Girls and Garters, Golem Spotter Weekly, and Fretwork Today. These were only the top layer. In self-defence against the elements, he glued old copies over the larger cracks and holes in the roof. As far as Trev knew, Carter had never persevered beyond a week with any of the hobbies indicated by his rather embarrassing library except, possibly, the one notoriously associated with the centrefolds of Giggles, Girls and Garters.\\n\\n Mrs Carter opened the door to him and indicated the stairs with all the hearty welcome and hospitality that mothers extend to their sons\u0027 no-good street friends. \u0027He\u0027s been ill,\u0027 she announced, as if it were a matter of interest rather than concern.\\n\\n This turned out to be an understatement. One of Carter\u0027s eyes was a technicolor mess and there was a livid scar on his face. It took some time for Trev to find this out because Carter kept telling him to go away, but since the ramshackle door was held shut with a piece of string, the application of Trev\u0027s shoulder had seen to that, at least.\\n\\n Trev stared at the boy, who shrank back into his unspeakably dreadful bed as if he was expecting to be hit. He didn\u0027t like Carter. No one liked Carter. It was impossible. Even Mrs Carter, who in theory at least should entertain some lukewarm affability to her son, didn\u0027t like Carter. He was fundamentally unlikeable. It was a sad thing to have to say, but Carter, farting or otherwise, was a wonderful example of charisntma. He could be fine for a day or two and then some utterly stupid comment or off-key joke or entirely inappropriate action would break the spell. But Trev put up with him, seeing in him, perhaps, what Trev might have been had he not been, in fact, Trev. Maybe there was a bit of Carter the Farter in every bloke at some time in his life he had thought, but with Carter it wasn\u0027t just a bit, it was everything.\\n\\n \u0027What \u0027appened?\u0027 Trev said.\\n\\n \u0027Nuffin\u0027.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is Trev. I know about nothin\u0027 \u0027appenin\u0027. You need to get to the hospital with that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s worse than it looks,\u0027 Carter moaned.\\n\\n Trev cracked. \u0027Are you bloody stupid? That cut\u0027s a quarter of an inch from your eye!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was my fault,\u0027 Carter protested. \u0027I upset Andy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I can see where that\u0027d have been your fault,\u0027 Trev said.\\n\\n \u0027Where were you last night?\u0027 said Carter.\\n\\n \u0027You wouldn\u0027t believe me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it was a bloody war, that\u0027s what it was.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I found it necessary to spend a little time down the Lat. There was fightin\u0027, wasn\u0027t there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The clubs \u0027ave signed up to this new football and some people ain\u0027t \u0027appy.\u0027\\n\\n Trev said, \u0027Andy?\u0027 and looked at the livid, oozing scar again. Yep, that looked like Andy being unhappy.\\n\\n It was hard to feel sorry for someone as basically unlikeable as Carter, but just because he had been born with Kick Me Up The Arse tattooed on to his soul was no reason for doing it. Not to Carter. That was like pulling wings off flies.\\n\\n \u0027Not just Andy,\u0027 said Carter. \u0027There\u0027s Tosher Atkinson and Jimmy the Spoon and Spanner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Spanner?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027And Mrs Atkinson.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mrs Atkinson?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And Willy Piltdown, Harry Capstick and the Brisket Boys.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Them? But we hate them. Andy hates them. They hate Andy. One foot on their turf and you get sent home in a sack!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, you know what they say,\u0027 said Carter. \u0027My enemy\u0027s enemy is my enemy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think you got that wrong,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027But I know what you mean.\u0027\\n\\n Trev stared at nothing, utterly aghast. The subjects of that litany of names were Faces. Hugely influential in the world of the teams and, more importantly, among the supporters. They owned the Shove. Pepe had been right. Vetinari thought the captains were in charge and the captains were not in charge. The Shove was in charge and the Faces ran the Shove.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s going to be a team put together for tomorrow and they\u0027ll try to get as many of them in as possible,\u0027 Carter volunteered.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I heard.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re going to show Vetinari what they think of his new football.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t hear the name of the Stollops there,\u0027 Trev said.\\n\\n \u0027I hear their dad\u0027s got them doing choir practice every night,\u0027 said Carter.\\n\\n \u0027The captains did sign up,\u0027 said Trev, \u0027so it\u0027ll look bad for them. But \u0027ow much do you think Andy and his little chums care \u0027bout that?\u0027 He leaned forward. \u0027Vetinari\u0027s got the Watch, though, \u0027asn\u0027t he? And you know about the Watch. Okay, so there\u0027s some decent bastards among \u0027em when you get \u0027em by theirselves, but if it all goes wahoonie-shaped they\u0027ve got big, big sticks and big, big trolls and they\u0027ve not got to bother too much about who they hit because they\u0027re the Watch, which means it\u0027s all legal. And, if you get \u0027em really pissed off, they\u0027ll add a charge of damaging their truncheons with your face. And talking of faces, exactly \u0027ow come you\u0027re a quarter-inch away from being a candidate for a white stick?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told Andy I didn\u0027t think it was a good idea,\u0027 said Carter.\\n\\n Trev couldn\u0027t hide his surprise. Even that much bravery was alien to Carter. \u0027Well, as it \u0027appens, it might be a blessin\u0027 in disguise. You just stay here in bed and you won\u0027t end up stuck between the Old Sam and Andy.\u0027\\n\\n He stopped because of a rustling noise.\\n\\n Since Carter glued pages of his used magazines to the walls with flour-and-water paste, the attic was home to some quite well fed mice, and for some reason, one of them had just gnawed its way to freedom via the chest of last year\u0027s Miss April, thus giving her a third nipple, which was, in fact, staring at Trev and wobbling. It was a sight to put anyone off their tea.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027re you goin\u0027 to do?\u0027 said Carter.\\n\\n \u0027Anything I can,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027You know Andy\u0027s out to get you? You and that weird bloke.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not afraid of Andy,\u0027 said Trev. As a statement, this was entirely true. He was not frightened of Andy. He was mortally terrified to his boots and back again, with a visceral fear that dripped off his ribs like melting snow.\\n\\n \u0027Everyone\u0027s afraid of Andy, Trev. If they\u0027re smart,\u0027 said Carter.\\n\\n \u0027Hey, Fartmeister, I\u0027m Trevor Likely!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think you\u0027re goin\u0027 to need a lot more than that.\u0027\\n\\n I am going to need a lot more than that, thought Trev, travelling at speed across the city. If even Pepe knew there was something on the boil, then surely the Old Sam would know too? Oops.\\n\\n He sprinted quickly to the horse bus\u0027s rear platform and landed in the road before the conductor was anywhere near. If they didn\u0027t catch you on the bus then they couldn\u0027t catch you at all, and while they were issued with those big shiny choppers to deter non-paying passengers, everyone knew that a) they were too scared to use them and b) the amount of trouble they would get into if they actually whacked a respectable member of society did not bear thinking of.\\n\\n He darted through the alley into Cockbill Street, spotted another bus plodding its way in the right direction, jumped on to the running board and held on. He was lucky this time. The conductor gave him a look and then very carefully did not see him.\\n\\n By the time he reached the big junction known as Five Ways, he had travelled almost the width of the city at an average speed faster than walking pace and had hardly had to run very far at all. A near perfect result for Trev Likely, who wouldn\u0027t walk if he could ride.\\n\\n And there, right in front of him, was the Hippo. It used to be a racetrack until all that was moved up to the far end of Ankh. Now, it was just a big space that every large town needs for markets, fairs, the occasional insurrection and, of course, the increasingly popular cart-tail sales, which were very fashionable with people who wanted to buy their property back.\\n\\n It was full today, without even a stolen shovel to be seen. All over the field, people were kicking footballs about. Trevor relaxed a little. There were pointy hats in the distance and no one seemed to be doing any murder.\\n\\n \u0027Wotcher, howya doing?\u0027\\n\\n He adjusted his eyeline down a little bit. \u0027How\u0027s it goin\u0027, Throat?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m hearing you\u0027re kind of associated with Unseen Academicals,\u0027 said Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, the city\u0027s most enterprising but inexplicably least successful businessman.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve come to sell pies?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nah, nah, nah,\u0027 said Dibbler. \u0027Too many amateurs here today. My pies aren\u0027t just knocked up out of rubbish for a load of drunken old football fans.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So your pies are for - ?\u0027 Trev left the question hanging in the air with a noose on the end of it.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, pies are so yesterday,\u0027 said Dibbler dismissively. \u0027I am on the ground floor of football memorabilityness.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like genuine autographed team jerseys and that sort of thing. I mean, look here.\u0027 Dibbler produced from the large tray around his neck a smaller version of what one of the new gloing! gloing! footballs would be if it were about a half of the size and had been badly carved out of wood. \u0027See those white patches? That\u0027s so they can be signed by the team.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re goin\u0027 to get them signed, are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, no, I think people would like to get that done themselves. The personal touch, you know what I mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So they\u0027re actually just painted balls of wood and nothin\u0027 else?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027But authentic!\u0027 said Dibbler. \u0027Just like the shirts. Want one? Five dollars to you, and that\u0027s cutting me own throat.\u0027 He produced a skimpy red cotton item and waved it enticingly.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your team colours, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Two big yellow Us on the front?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027That\u0027s wrong! Ours has got two little Us interlocked on the left breast like a badge. Very stylish.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pretty much the same,\u0027 said Dibbler airily. \u0027No one\u0027ll notice. And I had to keep the price down for the kiddies.\u0027\\n\\n He leaned closer. \u0027Anything you can tell me about the game tomorrow, Trev? Looks like the teams are putting together a tough squad. Vetinari\u0027s not going to get it all his own way for once?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll play a good game, you\u0027ll see,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027Right! Can\u0027t lose with a Likely playing, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I just help around the place. I\u0027m not playin\u0027. I promised my ol\u0027 mum after Dad died.\u0027\\n\\n Dibbler looked around at the crowded stadium of the Hippo. He appeared to have something else on his mind other than the need for the next dollar. \u0027What happens if your lot lose?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s only a game,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, but Vetinari\u0027s got his reputation based on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a game. One side wins, one side loses. Just a game.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A lot of people aren\u0027t thinking like that,\u0027 said Dibbler. \u0027Things always come out well for Vetinari,\u0027 he went on, staring at the sky. \u0027And that\u0027s the magic, see? Everyone thinks he always gets it right. What do you think will happen if he gets things wrong?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just a game, Throat, only a game... Be seein\u0027 you.\u0027 Trev wandered onwards. People were putting up tiers of wooden stands on one side of the arena, and because this was Ankh-Morpork, when two or more people gathered together thousands turned up just to wonder why.\\n\\n And there was Mr Ponder Stibbons, sitting at a long table with some of the football captains. Oh, yes, the Rules Committee. There had been talk about that. Even with the rules written down, and half of them as old as the game itself, there were a few things that had to be made clear. He arrived in time to hear Ponder say, \u0027Look, you can\u0027t have a situation in the new game where people hang around right next to the other team\u0027s goal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Worked all right before,\u0027 said one of the captains.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but the ball flies. One really good kick would send it down half the length of the Hippo. If someone gets that right the goalkeeper wouldn\u0027t have a chance.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So, what you\u0027re saying,\u0027 said Mr Stollop, who had become a kind of spokesman for the captains, \u0027is that there\u0027s got to be two blokes from team A in front of a bloke from team B before he scores?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s about right,\u0027 said Ponder stiffly, \u0027but one of them is the goalkeeper.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So, what happens if one of them fellers nips past him downfield before he kicks the ball?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then he will be what is traditionally known as off his side,\u0027 said Ponder.\\n\\n \u0027Off his head, more like,\u0027 said one of the captains. And since this had the same shape as humour, it got a laugh. \u0027If that\u0027s true, you could end up with loads of blokes rushing past one another, all trying to get the other poor buggers into an unlawful position without any of the poor devils moving, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nevertheless, we are standing by this rule. We have tried it out. It allows for free movement on the field. In the old game it wasn\u0027t unusual for players to bring their lunch and a copy of Girls, Giggles and Garters and just wait for the ball to come along.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hello, Trev, how are you getting on?\u0027 It was Andy, and he was standing behind Trev.\\n\\n There must be a thousand people here today, Trev thought in a curiously slow and blissful sort of way. And a lot of watchmen. I can see a couple of them from here. Andy isn\u0027t going to try anything right here, is he?\\n\\n Well, yes, he might, because that\u0027s what made him Andy. The little bee that buzzed in his brain might bang against the wrong bit and he would carve your face off. Oh, yes, and there was Tosher Atkinson and his mum, strolling about as if out for a walk.\\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t seen you about much lately, Trev,\u0027 said Andy. \u0027Been busy, I suspect?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought you were lyin\u0027 low?\u0027 said Trev hopelessly.\\n\\n \u0027Well, you know what they say. Sooner or later all sins are forgiven.\u0027\\n\\n In your case, quite a bit later, Trev thought.\\n\\n \u0027Besides,\u0027 said Andy, \u0027I\u0027m turning over a new leaf, ain\u0027t I?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yeah?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Got out of the Shove,\u0027 said Andy. \u0027Gotta put aside my scallywag ways. Time to fit in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Glad to hear it,\u0027 said Trev, waiting for the knife.\\n\\n \u0027So I\u0027m a key player for Ankh-Morpork United.\u0027 It wasn\u0027t a knife, but it had a rather similar effect. \u0027Apparently his lordship gave them the idea,\u0027 Andy said, still speaking in the same greasy, friendly tone. \u0027Of course, no one wants to be the team playing you wizards. So there is, like, a new one just for the occasion.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought you never played?\u0027 said Trev weakly.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, but that was in the bad old days before football was open to more individual effort and enterprise. See this shirt?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Trev looked down. He hadn\u0027t thought much about what the man was wearing, just that he was there.\\n\\n \u0027White with blue trim,\u0027 said Andy cheerfully. \u0027Very snazzy.\u0027 He turned around. The numeral 1 was on the back in blue with the name Andy Shank above it. \u0027My idea. Very sensible. Means we\u0027ll know who we are from the back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I told your wizards that your gentlemen ought to do the same,\u0027 said Mrs Atkinson, surely one of the most feared Faces who had ever wielded a sharpened umbrella with malice aforethought. Grown men would back away from Mrs Atkinson, otherwise grown men bled.\\n\\n Just what we need, thought Trev. Our names on the back as well. Saves them having the trouble to go round the front before they stab.\\n\\n \u0027Still, I can\u0027t stand here chattin\u0027 all day with you. Got to talk to the team. Got to think about tactics.\u0027\\n\\n There will be a referee, thought Trev. The Watch will be there. Lord Vetinari will be there. Unfortunately, Andy Shank will be there, too, and Nutt wants me as his assistant and so I\u0027ve got to be there. If it all goes wrong, the floor of the arena isn\u0027t going to be the place to be and I\u0027ll be in it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-16.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) \\n The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. \\n Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .).
