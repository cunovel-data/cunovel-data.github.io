{"id":94952,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u0027I think I\u0027d like to check a few things,\u0027 said the Master of The Traditions. \u0027I would not wish to worry you unduly.\u0027 He glanced down. \u0027Oh, hells\u0027 bells!\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about, man?\u0027 \u0027Well, it looks as though - No, it would be unfair to spoil your evening, Archchancellor,\u0027 Ponder protested. \u0027I must be reading this wrongly. He surely can\u0027t mean - Oh, good heavens... \u0027 \u0027In a nutshell, please, Stibbons,\u0027 growled Ridcully. \u0027I believe I am the Archchancellor of this university? I\u0027m sure it says so on my door.\u0027 \u0027Of course, Archchancellor, but it would be quite wrong of me to - \u0027 \u0027I appreciate that you do not wish to spoil my evening, sir,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027But I would not hesitate to spoil your day tomorrow. With that in mind, what the hells are you talking about?\u0027 \u0027Er, it would appear, Archchancellor, that, er... When was the last game we took part in, do you know?\u0027 \u0027Anyone?\u0027 said Ridcully to the room in general. A mumbled discussion produced a consensus on the theme of \u0027Around twenty years, give or take.\u0027 \u0027Give or take what, exactly?\u0027 said Ponder, who hated this kind of thing. \u0027Oh, you know. Something of that order. In the general vicinity of, so to speak. Round about then. You know.\u0027 \u0027About?\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Can we be more precise?\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027Because if the university hasn\u0027t played in the Poor Boys\u0027 Fun for a period of twenty years or more, the bequest reverts to any surviving relatives of Archchancellor Bigger.\u0027 \u0027But it\u0027s banned, man!\u0027 the Archchancellor insisted. \u0027Er, not as such. It\u0027s common knowledge that Lord Vetinari doesn\u0027t like it, but I understand that if the games are outside the city centre and confined to the back streets, the Watch turns a blind eye. Since I would imagine that the supporters and players easily outnumber the entire Watch payroll, I suppose it is better than having to turn a broken nose.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s quite a neat turn of phrase there, Mister Stibbons,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027I\u0027m quite surprised at you.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder. He had in fact got it from a leader in the Times, which the wizards did not like much because it either did not print what they said or printed what they said with embarrassing accuracy. Emboldened, he added, \u0027I should point out, though, that under UU law, Archchancellor, a ban doesn\u0027t matter. Wizards are not supposed to take notice of such a ban. We are not subject to mundane law.\u0027 \u0027Of course. But nevertheless it is generally convenient to acknowledge the civil power,\u0027 said Ridcully, speaking like a man choosing his words with such care that he was metaphorically taking some of them outside to look at them more closely in daylight. The wizards nodded. What they had heard was: \u0027Vetinari may have his little foibles, but he\u0027s the sanest man we\u0027ve had on the throne in centuries, he leaves us alone, and you never know what he\u0027s got up his sleeve.\u0027 You couldn\u0027t argue with that. \u0027All right, Stibbons, what do you suggest?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027These days you only ever tell me about a problem when you\u0027ve thought up a solution. I respect this, although I find it a bit creepy. Got a way to wriggle us out of this, have you?\u0027 \u0027I suppose so, sir. I thought we might, well, put up a team. It doesn\u0027t say anything about winning, sir. We just have to play, that\u0027s all.\u0027 It was always beautifully warm in the candle vats. Regrettably, it was also extremely humid and rather noisy in an erratic and unexpected way. This was because the giant pipes of Unseen University\u0027s central heating and hot water system passed overhead, slung from the ceiling on a series of metal straps with a greater or lesser coefficient of linear expansion. That was only the start, however. There were also the huge pipes for balancing the slood differential across the university, the pipe for the anthropic particle flux suppressor, which did not work properly these days, the pipes for the air circulation, which had not worked either since the donkey had been ill, and the very ancient tubes that were all that remained of the ill-fated attempt by a previous archchancellor to operate a university communication system by means of trained marmosets. At certain times of the day all this piping broke into a subterranean symphony of gurgles, twangs, upsetting organic trickling sounds and, occasionally, an inexplicable boinging noise that would reverberate through the cellar levels. The general ad hoc nature of the system\u0027s construction was enhanced by the fact that, as an economy measure, the big iron hot water pipes were lagged with old clothing held on by string. Since some of these items had once been wizards\u0027 apparel, and however hard you scrubbed you could never get all of the spells out, there were sporadic showers of multicoloured sparks and the occasional ping-pong ball. Despite everything, Nutt felt at home down among the vats. It was worrying; in the high country, people in the street had jeered at him that he\u0027d been made in a vat. Although Brother Oats had told him that this was silly, the gently bubbling tallow called to him. He felt at peace here. He ran the vats now. Smeems didn\u0027t know, because he hardly ever troubled to come down here. Trev knew, of course, but since Nutt doing his job for him meant that he could spend more time kicking a tin can around on some bit of wasteground he was happy. The opinion of the other dribblers and dippers didn\u0027t really count; if you worked in the vats it meant that, as far as the job market was concerned, you had been still accelerating when you\u0027d hit the bottom of the barrel and had been drilled into the bedrock. It meant that you no longer had enough charisma to be a beggar. It meant that you were on the run from something, possibly the gods themselves, or the demons inside you. It meant that if you dared to look up you would see, high above you, the dregs of society. Best, then, to stay down here in the warm gloom, with enough to eat and no inconvenient encounters and, Nutt added in his head, no beatings. No, the dippers were no problem. He did his best for them when he could. Life itself had beaten them so hard that they had no strength left to beat up anyone else. That was helpful. When people found out that you were a goblin, all you could expect was trouble. He remembered what the people in the villages had shouted at him when he was small and the word would be followed by a stone. Goblin. It was a word with an ox-train-load of baggage. It didn\u0027t matter what you said or did, or made, the train ran right over you. He\u0027d shown them the things he\u0027d built, and the stones had smashed them while the villagers screamed at him like hunting hawks and shouted more words. That had stopped on the day Pastor Oats rode gently into town, if a bunch of hovels and one street of stamped mud could be called a town, and he had brought... forgiveness. But on that day, no one had wanted to be forgiven. In the darkness, Concrete the troll, who was so gooned out on Slab, Slice, Sleek and Slump, and who would even snort iron filings if Nutt didn\u0027t stop him, whimpered on his mattress. Nutt lit a fresh candle and wound up his home-made dribbling aid. It whirred away happily, and made the flame go horizontal. He paid attention to his work. A good dribbler never turned the candle when he dribbled; candles in the wild, as it were, almost never dripped in more than one direction, which was away from the draught. No wonder the wizards liked the ones he made; there was something disconcerting about a candle that appeared to have dribbled in every direction at once. It could put a man off his stroke. He worked fast, and was putting the nineteenth well-dribbled candle in the delivery basket when he heard the clank of a tin can being bowled along the stone floor of the passage. \u0027Good morning, Mister Trev,\u0027 he said, without looking up. A moment later an empty tin can landed in front of him, on end, with no more ceremony than a jigsaw piece falling into place. \u0027How did you know it was me, Gobbo?\u0027 \u0027Your leitmotif, Mister Trev. And I\u0027d prefer Nutt, thank you.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s one o\u0027 them motifs?\u0027 said the voice behind him. \u0027It is a repeated theme or chord associated with a particular person or place, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt, carefully placing two more warm candles in the basket. \u0027I was referring to your love of kicking a tin can about. You seem in good spirits, sir. How went the day?\u0027 \u0027You what?\u0027 \u0027Did Fortune favour Dimwell last night?\u0027 \u0027What are you on about?\u0027 Nutt pulled back further. It could be dangerous not to fit in, not to be helpful, not to be careful. \u0027Did you win, sir?\u0027 \u0027Nah. Another no-score draw. Waste of time, really. But it was only a friendly. Nobody died.\u0027 Trev looked at the full baskets of realistically dribbled candles. \u0027That\u0027s a shitload you\u0027ve done there, kid,\u0027 he said kindly. Nutt hesitated again, and then said, very carefully, \u0027Despite the scatological reference, you approve of the large but unspecified number of candles that I have dribbled for you?\u0027 \u0027Blimey, what was that all about, Gobbo?\u0027 Frantically, Nutt sought for an acceptable translation. \u0027I done okay?\u0027 he ventured. Trev slapped him on the back. \u0027Yeah! Good job! Respect! But you gotta learn to speak more proper, you know. You wu\u0027nt last five minutes down our way. You\u0027d probably get a half-brick heaved at yer.\u0027 \u0027That has, I mean \u0027as been known to... \u0027appen,\u0027 said Nutt, concentrating. \u0027I never seen why people make such a to-do,\u0027 said Trev generously. \u0027So there were all those big battles? So what? It was a long time ago and a long way away, right, an\u0027 it\u0027s not like the trolls and dwarfs weren\u0027t as bad as you lot, ain\u0027t I right? I mean, goblins? What was that all about? You lot jus\u0027 cut throats and nicked stuff, right? That\u0027s practically civilized in some streets round here.\u0027 Probably, Nutt thought. No one could have been neutral when the Dark War had engulfed Far Uberwald. Maybe there had been true evil there, but apparently the evil was, oddly enough, always on the other side. Perhaps it was contagious. Somehow, in all the confusing histories that had been sung or written, the goblins were down as nasty cowardly little bastards who collected their own earwax and were always on the other side. Alas, when the time came to write their story down, his people hadn\u0027t even had a pencil. Smile at people. Like them. Be helpful. Accumulate worth. He liked Trev. He was good at liking people. When you clearly liked people, they were slightly more inclined to like you. Every little helped. Trev, though, seemed genuinely unfussed about history, and had recognized that having someone in the vats who not only did not try to eat the tallow but also did most of his work for him and, at that, did it better than he could be bothered to do it himself, was an asset worth protecting. Besides, he was congenially lazy, except when it came to foot-the-ball, and bigotry took too much effort. Trev never made too much effort. Trev went through life on primrose paths. \u0027Master Smeems came looking for you,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I sorted it all out.\u0027 \u0027Ta,\u0027 said Trev, and that was that. No questions. He liked Trev. But the boy was standing there, just staring at him, as if trying to work him out. \u0027Tell you what,\u0027 Trev said. \u0027Come on up to the Night Kitchen and we\u0027ll scrounge breakfast, okay?\u0027 \u0027Oh no, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt, almost dropping a candle. \u0027I don\u0027t think, sorry, fink, I ought to.\u0027 \u0027Come on, who\u0027s going to know? And there\u0027s a fat girl up there who cooks great stuff. Best food you ever tasted.\u0027 Nutt hesitated. Always agree, always be helpful, always be becoming, never frighten anyone. \u0027I fink I will come with you,\u0027 he said. There\u0027s a lot to be said for scrubbing a frying pan until you can see your face in it, especially if you\u0027ve been entertaining ideas of gently tapping someone on the head with it. Glenda was not in the mood for Trev when he came up the stone steps, kissed her on the back of the neck and said cheerfully, \u0027 \u0027ullo, darlin\u0027, what\u0027s hot tonight?\u0027 \u0027Nothing for the likes of you, Trevor Likely,\u0027 she said, batting him away with the pan, \u0027and you can keep your hands to yourself, thank you!\u0027 \u0027Not bin keeping somethin\u0027 warm for your best man?\u0027 Glenda sighed. \u0027There\u0027s bubble and squeak in the warming oven and don\u0027t say a word if anyone catches you,\u0027 she said. \u0027Just the job for a man who\u0027s bin workin\u0027 like a slave all night!\u0027 said Trev, patting her far too familiarly and heading for the ovens. \u0027You\u0027ve been at the football!\u0027 snapped Glenda. \u0027You\u0027re always at the football! And what kind of working do you call that?\u0027 The boy laughed, and she glared at his companion, who backed away quickly as though from armour-piercing eyes. \u0027And you boys ought to wash before you come up here,\u0027 she went on, glad of a target that didn\u0027t grin and blow kisses at her. \u0027This is a food-preparation area!\u0027 Nutt swallowed. This was the longest conversation he\u0027d ever had with a female apart from Ladyship and Miss Healstether and he hadn\u0027t even said anything. \u0027I assure you, I bath regularly,\u0027 he protested. \u0027But you\u0027re grey!\u0027 \u0027Well, some people are black and some people are white,\u0027 said Nutt, almost in tears. Oh, why had he, why had he left the vats? It was nice and uncomplicated down there, and quiet, too, when Concrete hadn\u0027t been on the ferrous oxide. \u0027It doesn\u0027t work like that. You\u0027re not a zombie, are you? I know they do their best, and none of us can help how we die, but I\u0027m not having all that trouble again. Anyone might get their finger in the soup, but rolling around in the bottom of the bowl? That\u0027s not right.\u0027 \u0027I am alive, miss,\u0027 said Nutt helplessly. \u0027Yes, but a live what, that\u0027s what I\u0027d like to know.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m a goblin, miss.\u0027 He hesitated as he said it. It sounded like a lie. \u0027I thought goblins had horns,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Only the grown-up ones, miss.\u0027 Well, that was true, for some goblins. \u0027You lot don\u0027t do anything nasty, do you?\u0027 said Glenda, glaring at Nutt. But he recognized it as a kind of residual glare; she\u0027d said her piece, and now it was just a bit of play-acting, to show she was the boss here. And bosses can afford to be generous, especially when you look a little fearful and suitably impressed. It worked. Glenda said, \u0027Trev, fetch Mister... ?\u0027 \u0027Nutt,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Fetch Mister Nutt some bubble and squeak, will you? He looks half-starved.\u0027 \u0027I have a very fast metabolism,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I don\u0027t mind about that,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027so long as you don\u0027t go showing it to people. I have enough - \u0027 There was a crash from behind her. Trev had dropped the tray of bubble and squeak. He was stock still, staring at Juliet, who was returning the stare with a look of deep disgust. Finally, she said, in a voice like pearls, \u0027 \u0027ad your bleedin\u0027 eyeful? You got a nerve, largin\u0027 it in here wiv that rag round your neck! Everyone knows Dimwell are well pants. Beasly couldn\u0027t carry the ball in a sack.\u0027 \u0027Oh yeah right? Well, I hear that the Lobbins walked all over you last week. Lobbin Clout! Everyone knows they\u0027re a bunch o\u0027 grannies!\u0027 \u0027Oh yeah, that\u0027s all you know! Staple Upwright was let out of the Tanty the day before! See if you Dimmers like him stamping all over you!\u0027 \u0027Old Staple? Ha! He\u0027ll clog away, yeah, but he can\u0027t run above a canter! We\u0027ll run rings around - \u0027 Glenda\u0027s frying pan clanged loudly on top of the iron range. \u0027Enough of that, the pair of you! I\u0027ve got to clean up for the day, and I don\u0027t want football dirtying up my nice surfaces, you hear me? You wait here, my girl, and you, Trevor Likely, you get back to your cellar, and I shall want that dish cleaned and back here by tomorrow night or you can try begging your meals off some other girl, right? Take your little friend with you. Nice to meet you, Mister Nutt, but I wish I could find you in better company.\u0027 She paused. Nutt looked so lost and bewildered. Gods help me, she thought, I\u0027m turning into my mum again. \u0027No, wait.\u0027 She reached down, opened one of the warming ovens and came back again with another large dish. The scent of cooked apples filled the kitchen. \u0027This is for you, Mister Nutt, with my compliments. You need fattening up before you blow away. Don\u0027t bother to share it with this scallywag, \u0027cos he\u0027s a greedy beggar, ask anyone. Now, I\u0027ve got to clean up, and if you boys don\u0027t want to help, get out of my kitchen! Oh, and I\u0027ll want that dish back as well!\u0027 Trev grabbed Nutt\u0027s shoulder. \u0027Come on, you heard what she said.\u0027 \u0027Yes, and I don\u0027t mind helping - \u0027 \u0027Come on!\u0027 \u0027Thank you very much, miss,\u0027 Nutt managed, as he was dragged down the stairs. Glenda folded her oven cloth neatly as she watched them go. \u0027Goblins,\u0027 she said thoughtfully. \u0027Have you ever seen a goblin before, Jools?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Have you ever seen a goblin?\u0027 \u0027Dunno.\u0027 \u0027Do you think he\u0027s a goblin?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Mr Nutt. Is he a goblin, do you think?\u0027 said Glenda, as patiently as possible. \u0027He\u0027s a posh one, then. I mean, he sounded like he reads books and stuff.\u0027 This was a discrimination that was, in Glenda\u0027s view, at practically forensic standards of observation for Juliet. She turned around and found to her surprise that Juliet had gone back to reading something, or at least staring intently at the words. \u0027What have you got there?\u0027 she asked. \u0027It\u0027s called Bu-bubble. It\u0027s like, what important people are doing.\u0027 Glenda looked over her friend\u0027s shoulder as she leafed through the pages. As far as she could tell all the important people shared one smile and were wearing unsuitable clothes for this time of year. \u0027So what is it that makes them important?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Just being in a magazine?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s fashion tips too,\u0027 said Juliet defensively. \u0027Look, it says here chrome and copper micromail is the look for the season.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the page for dwarfs,\u0027 sighed Glenda. \u0027Come on, get your things and I\u0027ll take you home.\u0027 Juliet was still reading as they waited for the horse bus. Such sudden devotion to a printed page worried Glenda. The last thing she wanted was to see her friend getting ideas in her head. There was such a lot of room in there for them to bounce around and do damage. Glenda herself was reading one of her cheap novels wrapped in a page of the Times. She read the way a cat eats: furtively, daring anyone to notice. While the horses plodded up towards Dolly Sisters, she took her scarf out of her bag and absent-mindedly wrapped it around her wrist. Personally, she hated the violence of the football, but it was important to belong. Not belonging, especially after a big game, could be dangerous to your health. It was important to show the right colours on your home turf. It was important to fit in. For some reason, that thought immediately turned her mind to Nutt. How strange he was. Kind of ugly, but very clean. He had stunk of soap and seemed so nervous. There was something about him... The air in the Uncommon Room had gone as cold as meltwater. \u0027Are you telling us, Mister Stibbons, that we should be seen to enter a game for bullies, louts and roughs?\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. \u0027That would be impossible!\u0027 \u0027Unlikely, yes. Impossible? No,\u0027 said Ponder wearily. \u0027Most certainly not possible!\u0027 said the Senior Wrangler, nodding at the Chair. \u0027We would be trading kicks with people from the gutters!\u0027 \u0027My grandfather scored two goals in a match against Dimwell,\u0027 said Ridcully, in a quiet, matter-of-fact voice. \u0027Most people never managed one in their lives, in those days. I think the most number of goals scored by one man in his whole life is four. That was Dave Likely, of course.\u0027 There was a ripple of hurried rethinking and retrenchment. \u0027Ah, well, of course, those were different times,\u0027 said the Senior Wrangler, suddenly all syrup. \u0027I\u0027m sure that even skilled workmen occasionally took part in a spirit of fun.\u0027 \u0027It wasn\u0027t much fun if they ran into Granddad,\u0027 said Ridcully, with a faint little grin. \u0027He was a prizefighter. He knocked people down for money and pubs sent for him if there was a really dangerous brawl. Of course, in a sense, this made it even more dangerous, but by then most of it was out in the street.\u0027 \u0027He threw people out of the buildings?\u0027 \u0027Oh yes. In fairness, it was usually from the ground floor and he always opened the window first. He was a very gentle man, I understand. Made musical boxes for a living, very delicate, won awards for them. Teetotal, you know, and quite religious as well. The punching was just a job of casual work. I know for a fact he never tore off anything that couldn\u0027t be stitched on again. A decent chap, by all accounts. Never met him, unfortunately. I\u0027ve always wished I had something to remember the old boy by.\u0027 As one wizard, the faculty looked down at Ridcully\u0027s huge hands. They were the size of frying pans. He cracked his knuckles. There was an echo. \u0027Mister Stibbons, all we need to do is engage another team and lose?\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s right, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027You simply forfeit the game.\u0027 \u0027But losing means being seen not to win, am I right?\u0027 \u0027That would be so, yes.\u0027 \u0027Then I rather think we ought to win, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Really, Mustrum, this is going too far,\u0027 said the Senior Wrangler. \u0027Excuse me?\u0027 said Ridcully, raising his eyebrows. \u0027May I remind you that the Archchancellor of this university is, by college statute, the first among equals?\u0027 \u0027Of course.\u0027 \u0027Good. Well, I am he. The word first is, I think, germane here. I see you scribbling in your little notebook, Mister Stibbons?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Archchancellor. I\u0027m looking to see if we could manage without the bequest.\u0027 \u0027Good man,\u0027 said the Senior Wrangler, glaring at Ridcully. \u0027I knew there was no reason to panic.\u0027 \u0027In fact I\u0027m pleased to say that I think we could rub along quite well with only a minimal cut in expenditure,\u0027 Ponder went on. \u0027There,\u0027 said the Senior Wrangler, looking triumphantly at the first among equals, \u0027you see what happens if you don\u0027t simply panic.\u0027 \u0027Indeed,\u0027 said Ridcully calmly. With his gaze still fixed on the Senior Wrangler he added, \u0027Mister Stibbons, would you be so kind as to enlighten the rest of us: to what, in reality, does a \"minimal cut in expenditure\" equate?\u0027 \u0027The bequest is a trust,\u0027 said Ponder, still scribbling. \u0027We have the use of the significant income from the very wise investments of the Bigger trustees, but we cannot touch the capital. Nevertheless, the income is enough to cover-I\u0027m sorry to be imprecise-about eighty-seven point four per cent of the university\u0027s food bill.\u0027 He waited patiently until the uproar had died away. It was amazing, he thought, how people would argue against figures on no better basis than \u0027they must be wrong\u0027. \u0027I\u0027m sure the Bursar would not agree with those figures,\u0027 said the Senior Wrangler sourly. \u0027That is so,\u0027 said Ponder, \u0027but I\u0027m afraid that is because he regards the decimal point as a nuisance.\u0027 The faculty looked at one another. \u0027Then who is dealing with our financial affairs?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Since last month? Me,\u0027 said Ponder, \u0027but I would be happy to hand the responsibility over to the first volunteer.\u0027 This worked. Regrettably, it always did. \u0027In that case,\u0027 he said, in the sudden silence, \u0027I have worked out, with reference to calorific tables, a regime that will give every man here a nourishing three meals a day - \u0027 The Senior Wrangler frowned. \u0027Three meals? Three meals? What kind of person has three meals a day?\u0027 \u0027Someone who can\u0027t afford nine,\u0027 said Ponder flatly. \u0027We could eke out the money if we concentrate on a healthy diet of grains and fresh vegetables. That would allow us to keep the cheeseboard with a choice of, say, three types of cheese.\u0027 \u0027Three cheeses isn\u0027t a choice, it\u0027s a penance!\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes. \u0027Or we could play a game of football, gentlemen,\u0027 said Ridcully, clapping his hands together cheerfully. \u0027One game. That\u0027s all. How hard would that be?\u0027 \u0027As hard as a face full of hobnails, perhaps?\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. \u0027People get trodden into the cobbles!\u0027 \u0027If all else fails, we will find volunteers from the student body,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Corpse might be a better word.\u0027 The Archchancellor leaned back in his chair. \u0027What makes a wizard, gentlemen? A facility with magic? Yes, of course, but around this table we know this is not, for the right kind of mind, hard to obtain. It does not, as it were, happen like magic. Good heavens, witches manage it. But what makes a magic user is a certain cast of mind which looks a little deeper into the world and the way it works, the way its currents twist the fortunes of mankind, et cetera, et cetera. In short, they should be the kind of person who might calculate that a guaranteed double first is worth the occasional inconvenience of sliding down the street on their teeth.\u0027 \u0027Are you seriously suggesting that we give out degrees for mere physical prowess?\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. \u0027No, of course not. I am seriously suggesting that we give out degrees for extreme physical prowess. May I remind you that I rowed for this university for five years and got a Brown?\u0027 \u0027And what good did that do, pray?\u0027 \u0027Well, it does say \"Archchancellor\" on my door. Do you remember why? The University Council at the time took the very decent view that it might be the moment for a leader who was not stupid, mad or dead. Admittedly, most of these are not exactly qualifications in the normal sense, but I like to think that the skill of leadership, tactics and creative cheating that I learned on the river also stood me in good stead. And thus for my sins, which I don\u0027t actually remember committing but must have been quite crimson, I was at the top of a shortlist of one. Was that a choice of three cheeses, Mister Stibbons?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Archchancellor.\u0027 \u0027I was just checking.\u0027 Ridcully leaned forward. \u0027Gentlemen, in the morning, correction, later this morning, I propose to tell Vetinari firmly that this university intends to once again play football. And the task falls to me because I am the first among equals. If any of you would like to try your luck in the Oblong Office, you have only to say.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027ll suspect something, you know,\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. \u0027He suspects everything. That is why he is still Patrician.\u0027 Ridcully stood up. \u0027I declare this meet - this overly extended snack... over. Mister Stibbons, come with me!\u0027 Ponder hurried after him, books clutched to his chest, happy for the excuse to get out of there before they turned on him. The bringer of bad news is never popular, especially when it\u0027s on an empty plate. \u0027Archchancellor, I - \u0027 he began, but Ridcully held his finger to his lips. After a moment of cloying silence, there was a sudden festival of scuffling, as of men fighting in silence. \u0027Good for them,\u0027 Ridcully said, heading off down the corridor. \u0027I wondered how long it would take them to realize that they might be seeing the last overloaded snack trolley for some time. I\u0027m almost tempted to wait and see them waddle out with their robes sagging.\u0027 Ponder stared at him. \u0027Are you enjoying this, Archchancellor?\u0027 \u0027Good heavens no,\u0027 said Ridcully, his eyes sparkling. \u0027How could you suggest such a thing? Besides, in a few hours I have to tell Havelock Vetinari that we are intending to become a personal affront. The unschooled mob hacking at one another\u0027s legs is one thing. I don\u0027t believe he will be happy with the prospect of our joining in.\u0027 \u0027Of course, sir. Er, there is a minor matter, sir, a small conundrum, if you will... Who is Nutt?\u0027 There seemed to Ponder to be a rather longer pause than necessary before Ridcully said, \u0027Nutt would be... ?\u0027 \u0027He works in the candle vats, sir.\u0027 \u0027How do you know that, Stibbons?\u0027 \u0027I do the wages, sir. The Candle Knave says Nutt just turned up one night with a chitty saying he was to be employed and paid minimal wage.\u0027 \u0027Well?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s all I know, sir, and I only found that out because I asked Smeems. Smeems says he\u0027s a good lad but sort of odd.\u0027 \u0027Then he should fit right in, don\u0027t you think, Stibbons? In fact, we are seeing how he fits in.\u0027 \u0027Well yes, sir, no problem there, but he\u0027s a goblin, apparently, and generally, you know, it\u0027s a sort of odd tradition, but when the first people from other races first come to the city they start out in the Watch... \u0027 Ridcully cleared his throat, loudly. \u0027The trouble with the Watch, Stibbons, is that they ask too many questions. We should not emulate them, I suggest.\u0027 He looked at Ponder and appeared to reach a decision. \u0027You know that you have a glowing future here at UU, Stibbons.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said Ponder gloomily. \u0027I would advise you, with this in mind, to forget all about Mister Nutt.\u0027 \u0027Excuse me, Archchancellor, but that simply will not do!\u0027 Ridcully swayed backwards, like a man subjected to an attack by a hitherto comatose sheep. Ponder plunged on, because when you have dived off a cliff your only hope is to press for the abolition of gravity. \u0027I have twelve jobs in this university,\u0027 he said. \u0027I do all the paperwork. I do all the adding up. In fact, I do everything that requires even a modicum of effort and responsibility! And I go on doing it even though Brazeneck have offered me the post of Bursar! With a staff! I mean real people, not a stick with a knob on the end. Now... Will... You... Trust... Me? What is it about Nutt that is so important?\u0027 \u0027The bastard tried to lure you away?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027How sharper than a serpent\u0027s tooth it is to have a thankless Dean! Is there nothing he will not stoop to? How much did - \u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t ask,\u0027 said Ponder quietly. There was a moment of silence and then Ridcully patted him a couple of times on the shoulder. \u0027The problem with Mister Nutt is that people want to kill him.\u0027 \u0027What people?\u0027 Ridcully stared into Ponder\u0027s eyes. His lips moved. He squinted up and down like a man engaged in complex calculation. He shrugged. \u0027Probably everybody,\u0027 he said. \u0027Please have some more of my wonderful apple pie,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027But she gave it to you,\u0027 said Trev, grinning. \u0027I\u0027d never \u0027ear the end of it if I ate your pie.\u0027 \u0027But you are my friend, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027And since it is my pie I can decide what to do with it.\u0027 \u0027Nah,\u0027 said Trev, waving it away. \u0027But there is a little errand you can do for me, me being a kind and understanding boss what lets you work all the hours you want.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Mister Trev?\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Glenda will come in around midday. To be honest, she hardly ever leaves the place. I would like you to go and ask her the name of that girl who was up there tonight.\u0027 \u0027The one who shouted at you, Mister Trev?\u0027 \u0027The very same,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Of course I will do that,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027But why don\u0027t you ask Miss Glenda yourself? She knows you.\u0027 Trev grinned again. \u0027Yes, she does and that\u0027s why I know she won\u0027t tell me. If I am any judge, and I\u0027m pretty sound, she would like to know you better. I\u0027ve never met a lady so good at feelin\u0027 sorry for people.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s not much of me to know,\u0027 said Nutt. Trev gave him a long, thoughtful glance. Nutt had not taken his eyes off his work. Trev had never seen anyone who could be so easily engrossed. Other people who ended up working in the vats were a bit weird, it was almost a requirement, but the little dark-grey fellow was somehow weird in the opposite direction. \u0027You know, you ought to get out more, Mister Nutts,\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t think I should like that at all,\u0027 said Nutt, \u0027and may I kindly remind you my name is not plural, thank you.\u0027 \u0027\u0027ave you ever seen a game of football?\u0027 \u0027No, Mister Trev.\u0027 \u0027Then I\u0027ll take you to the match tomorrow. I don\u0027t play, o\u0027course, but I never miss a game if I can \u0027elp it,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027No edged weapons, prob\u0027ly. The season starts soon, everyone\u0027s warming up.\u0027 \u0027Well, that is very kind of you, but I - \u0027 \u0027Tell you what, I\u0027ll pick you up down \u0027ere at one o\u0027clock.\u0027 \u0027But people will look at me!\u0027 said Nutt. And in his head he could hear Ladyship\u0027s voice, calm and cool as ever: Do not stand out. Be part of the crowd. \u0027No, they won\u0027t. Trust me on that,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I can sort that out. Enjoy your pie. I\u0027m off.\u0027 He pulled a tin can out of his coat pocket, dropped it on to his foot, flicked it into the air, toed it a few times so it spun and twinkled like some celestial object and then kicked it very hard so it sailed off down the huge gloomy room a few feet above the vats, rattling slightly. Against all probability it stopped in its flight a few feet from the far wall, spun for a moment and then started to come back with, it seemed to the amazed Nutt, a greater speed than before. Trev caught it effortlessly and dropped it back into his pocket. \u0027How can you do that, Mister Trev?\u0027 said Nutt, astonished. \u0027Never thought about it,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027But I always wonder why everyone else can\u0027t. It\u0027s just about the spinning. It\u0027s not hard. See yer tomorrow, okay? And don\u0027t forget that name.\u0027 The horse buses were not much faster than walking, but it wasn\u0027t you doing the walking, and there were seats and a roof and a guard with a battle-axe and all in all it was, in the damp grey hours before dawn, good value for tuppence. Glenda and Juliet sat side by side, rocking gently to the sway, lost in their thoughts. At least Glenda was; Juliet could get lost in half a thought, if that. But Glenda had become an expert at knowing when Juliet was going to speak. It was rather like the sense a sailor has that the wind is going to change. There were little signs, as if a thought had to get the beautiful brain warmed up and spinning before anything could happen. \u0027Who was that boy what come up for his bubble and squeak?\u0027 she asked nonchalantly, or what she probably thought was nonchalantly, or again, what she might have thought was nonchalantly had she known that there was a word like nonchalantly. \u0027That\u0027s Trevor Likely,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And you don\u0027t want anything to do with him.\u0027 \u0027Why not?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s a Dimmer! Fancies himself as a Face, too. And his dad was Big Dave Likely! Your dad would go mad if he heard you\u0027d even talked to him.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s got a lovely smile,\u0027 said Juliet, with a wistfulness that rang all kinds of alarms for Glenda. \u0027He\u0027s a scallywag,\u0027 she said firmly. \u0027He\u0027ll try on anything. Can\u0027t keep his hands to himself, too.\u0027 \u0027How come you knows that?\u0027 said Juliet. That was another worrying thing about Juliet. Nothing much seemed to be going on between those perfect ears for hours on end and then a question like that would come spinning towards you with edges on it. \u0027You know, you should try to speak better,\u0027 Glenda said, to change the subject. \u0027With your looks you could snag a man who thinks about more than beer and footie. Just speak with a little more class, eh? You don\u0027t have to sound like - \u0027 \u0027My fare, lady?\u0027 They looked up at the guard, who was holding his axe in a way that was very nearly not threatening. And when it came to looking up, this was not a long way. The axe\u0027s owner was very short. Glenda gently pushed the weapon out of the way. \u0027Don\u0027t wave it about, Roger,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027It doesn\u0027t impress.\u0027 \u0027Oh, sorry, Miss Glenda,\u0027 said the dwarf, what was visible of his face behind the beard colouring with embarrassment. \u0027It\u0027s been a long shift. That will be fourpence, ladies. Sorry about the axe, but we\u0027ve been getting people jumping off without paying.\u0027 \u0027He ought to be sent back to where he came from,\u0027 muttered Juliet, as the guard moved on along the bus. Glenda chose not to rise to this. As far as she had been able to tell, up until today, at least, her friend had no opinions of her own, and simply echoed anything other people said to her. But then she couldn\u0027t resist. \u0027That would be Treacle Mine Road, then. He was born in the city.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s a Miners fan, then? I suppose it could be worse.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think dwarfs bother much about football,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I don\u0027t fink you can be a real Morporkian an\u0027 not shout for your team,\u0027 was the next piece of worn-out folk wisdom from Juliet. Glenda let this one pass. Sometimes, arguing with her friend was like punching mist. Besides, the plodding horses were laboriously passing their street. They got off without missing a step. The door to Juliet\u0027s house was covered in the ancient remnants of multiple layers of paint, or, rather, multiple layers of paint that had bubbled up into tiny little mountains over the years. It was always the cheapest paint possible. After all, you could afford to buy beer or you could afford to buy paint and you couldn\u0027t drink paint unless you were Mr Johnson at number fourteen, who apparently drank it all the time. \u0027Now, I won\u0027t tell your dad that you were late,\u0027 said Glenda, opening the door for her. \u0027But I want you in early tomorrow, all right?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Glenda,\u0027 said Juliet meekly. \u0027And no thinking about that Trevor Likely.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Glenda.\u0027 It was a meek reply, but Glenda recognized the sparkle. She\u0027d seen it in the mirror once. But now she cooked an early breakfast for widow Crowdy, who occupied the house on the other side and couldn\u0027t get about much these days, made her comfortable, did the chores in the rising light, and finally went to bed. Her last thought as she plummeted into sleep was: Don\u0027t goblins steal chickens? Funny, he doesn\u0027t look the type... At half past eight, a neighbour woke her up by throwing gravel at her window. He wanted her to come and look at his father, described as \u0027poorly\u0027, and the day began. She had never needed to buy an alarm clock. Why did other people need so much sleep? It was a permanent puzzle for Nutt. It got boring by himself. Back in the castle in Uberwald there had always been someone around to talk to. Ladyship liked the night-time and wouldn\u0027t go out in bright sunshine at all, so a lot of visitors came then. He had to stay out of sight, of course, but he knew all the passages in the walls and all the secret spy-holes. He saw the fine gentlemen, always in black, and the dwarfs with iron armour that gleamed like gold (later, down in his cellar that smelled of salt and thunderstorms, Igor showed him how it was made). There were trolls, too, looking a bit more polished than the ones he\u0027d learned to run away from in the forests. He especially remembered the troll that shone like a jewel (Igor said his skin was made of living diamond). That alone would have been enough to glue him into Nutt\u0027s memory, but there had been that moment, one day when the diamond troll was seated at the big table with other trolls and dwarfs, when the diamond eyes had looked up and had seen Nutt, looking through a tiny, hidden spy-hole at the other end of the room. Nutt was convinced of it. He\u0027d jerked away from the hole so quickly that he\u0027d banged his head on the wall opposite. He\u0027d grown to know his way around all the cellars and workshops in Ladyship\u0027s castle. Go anywhere you wish, talk to everyone. Ask any questions; you will be given answers. When you want to learn, you will be taught. Use the library. Open any book. Those had been good days. Everywhere he went, men stopped work to show him how to plane and carve and mould and fettle and smelt iron and make horseshoes�Cbut not how to fit them, because any horse went mad when he entered the stables. One once kicked the boards out of the rear wall. That particular afternoon he went up to the library, where Miss Healstether found him a book on scent. He read it so fast that his eyes should have left trails on the paper. He certainly left a trail in the library: the twenty-two volumes of Brakefast\u0027s Compendium of Odours were soon stacked on the long lectern, followed by Spout\u0027s Trumpet of Equestrianism, and then, via a detour through the history section, Nutt plunged into the folklore section, with Miss Healstether pedalling after him on the mobile library steps. She watched him with a kind of gratified awe. He\u0027d been barely able to read when he\u0027d arrived, but the goblin boy had set out to improve his reading as a boxer trains for a fight. And he was fighting something, but she wasn\u0027t sure in her own mind what it was and, of course, Ladyship never explained. He would sit all night under the lamp, book of the moment in front of him, dictionary and thesaurus on either side, wringing the meaning out of every word, punching ceaselessly at his own ignorance.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-2.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about football—the most important thing about football—is that it is never just about football.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
