{"id":94965,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u0027How long will it take to get there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, this is the late-night bus, okay? It\u0027s for people who\u0027ve got to be in Sto Lat early and haven\u0027t got much money, and there\u0027s the rub, see? The less the money, the slower the travel. We get there in the end. Somewhere around about dawn, in fact.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All night? I think I could walk it faster.\u0027\\n\\n The man had the quiet, friendly air about him of someone who had found the best way to get through life was never to give much of a stuff about anything. \u0027Be my guest,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ll wave to you as we go past.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda looked down the length of the coach. It was half full of the kind of people who took the overnight bus because it wasn\u0027t very expensive; the kind of people, in fact, who had brought their own dinner in a paper bag, and probably not a new paper bag at that.\\n\\n The three of them huddled. \u0027It\u0027s the only one we can afford,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I don\u0027t think we can even afford travel for one on the mail coaches.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t we try and bargain with him?\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027Good idea,\u0027 said Trev. He walked back to the coach.\\n\\n \u0027Hello again,\u0027 said the driver.\\n\\n \u0027When are you gonna leave?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027In about five minutes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So everyone who\u0027s gonna be riding is on the coach.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda glanced past the driver. The passenger behind him was very meticulously peeling a hardboiled egg.\\n\\n \u0027Could be,\u0027 said the driver.\\n\\n \u0027Then why not leave right now,\u0027 said Trev, \u0027and go faster? It\u0027s very important.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Late-night,\u0027 said the driver. \u0027That\u0027s what I said.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Supposing I was to threaten you with this lead pipe, would you go any faster?\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027Trevor Likely!\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You can\u0027t go around threatening people with lead pipes!\u0027\\n\\n The driver looked down at Trev and said, \u0027Can you run that past me again?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you that I had this length of lead pipe,\u0027 said Trev, banging it gently against the bus\u0027s door. \u0027Sorry, but we really need to get to Sto Lat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, right, yes,\u0027 said the driver, \u0027I see your lead pipe,\u0027 and he reached down to the other side of his seat, \u0027and I will raise you this battle-axe and would remind you that if I were to cut you in arf, the law would be on my side, no offence meant. You must think I am some kind of fool, but you\u0027re all hopping about like nits on a griddle, so what\u0027s this all about then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve got to catch up with our friend. He could be in danger,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027And it\u0027s very romantic,\u0027 said Juliet.\\n\\n The driver looked at her.\\n\\n \u0027If you \u0027elp us catch up wiv him, I\u0027ll give you a big kiss,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027There!\u0027 said the driver to Trev. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you think of that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, I\u0027ll give you a kiss as well,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n \u0027No thanks, sir,\u0027 said the driver, clearly enjoying himself. \u0027In your case I think I\u0027ll go for the lead pipe, although please don\u0027t try anything \u0027cos it\u0027s a devil\u0027s own job to get the bloodstains off the seats. Nothing seems to shift them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay, I\u0027ll try to hit you with the lead pipe,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027We\u0027re desperate.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And we\u0027ll give you some money,\u0027 said Juliet.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry?\u0027 said the driver. \u0027Do I get the kiss, the money and the lead pipe? I mean, I\u0027d rather forgo the lead pipe for another kiss.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Two kisses, a whole three dollars and no lead pipe,\u0027 said Juliet.\\n\\n \u0027Or just the lead pipe and I\u0027ll take my chances,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n Glenda, who had been watching them with a fascinated horror, said, \u0027And I\u0027ll give you a kiss as well if you like.\u0027 She couldn\u0027t help noticing that this didn\u0027t move the stakes either way.\\n\\n \u0027But what about my passengers?\u0027 said the driver.\\n\\n All four of them looked into the back of the bus and realized that they were the subject of at least a dozen fascinated stares. \u0027Go for the kiss!\u0027 said a woman, holding a large laundry basket in front of her.\\n\\n \u0027And the money!\u0027 said one of the men.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t give a stuff if she kisses him or hits him on the head with the lead pipe, so long as they drop us off first,\u0027 said an old man towards the back of the bus.\\n\\n \u0027Do any of us get kissed as well?\u0027 said one half of a couple of giggling boys.\\n\\n \u0027If you like,\u0027 said Glenda viciously. They slumped back into their seats.\\n\\n Juliet grabbed the driver\u0027s face and there was, for what seemed slightly too long, by the internal clocks of both Glenda and Trev, the sound of a tennis ball being sucked through the strings of a tennis racket. Juliet stepped back. The driver was smiling, in a slightly stunned and cross-eyed way. \u0027Well, that was pretty much of a lead pipe!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps I\u0027d better drive,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n The driver smiled at him. \u0027I\u0027ll drive, thank you very much, and don\u0027t kid yourself, mister, I know a dicey one when I see one and you don\u0027t come close. My old mum would be more likely to hit me with a lead pipe than you. Throw it away, why don\u0027t you, or someone will give you a centre parting you won\u0027t forget in a hurry.\u0027\\n\\n He winked at Juliet. \u0027What with one thing or another it\u0027s a good idea to give the horses a bit of a run every now and again. All aboard for Sto Lat.\u0027\\n\\n The horse buses did not usually travel very fast and the driver\u0027s definition of a run was only marginally faster than what most people would call a walk, but he managed to get them up to something that at least meant they did not have the time to get bored by a passing tree.\\n\\n The bus was for people, as the driver had pointed out, who couldn\u0027t afford speed but could afford time. In its construction, therefore, no expense had been attempted. It was really no more than a cart with double seats all the way along it from the driver\u0027s slightly elevated bench. Tarpaulins on either side kept out the worst of the weather but fortunately still let in enough of the wind to mitigate the smell of the upholstery, which had experienced humanity in all its manifold moods and urgencies.\\n\\n Glenda got the impression that some of the travellers were regulars. An elderly woman was sitting quietly knitting. The boys were still engaged in the furtive giggling appropriate to their age, and a dwarf was staring out of the window without looking at anything in particular. No one really bothered about talking to anybody, except a man right at the back, who was having a continuous conversation with himself.\\n\\n \u0027This isn\u0027t fast enough!\u0027 Glenda shouted after ten minutes of bouncing over the potholes. \u0027I could run faster than this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think he\u0027s gonna get that far,\u0027 said Trev.\\n\\n The sun was going down and the shadows were already drawing across the cabbage fields, but there was a figure on the road ahead, struggling. Trev jumped off.\\n\\n \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s those wretched things,\u0027 said Glenda, running up behind him. \u0027Give me that lead pipe.\u0027\\n\\n Nutt was half crouched in the dust on the road. The Sisters of Perpetual Velocity were half flying and half flapping around him while he tried to protect his face with his hands. The passengers of the bus were quite unnoticed until the lead pipe arrived, followed very shortly by Glenda. It didn\u0027t have the effect she\u0027d hoped. The Sisters were indeed like birds. She couldn\u0027t so much hit them as bat them through the air.\\n\\n \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You stop trying to hurt him!\u0027 she screamed. \u0027He hasn\u0027t done anything wrong!\u0027\\n\\n Nutt raised an arm and grabbed her wrist. There wasn\u0027t much pressure, but somehow she couldn\u0027t move it at all. It was as if it had suddenly been embalmed in stone. \u0027They\u0027re not here to hurt me,\u0027 he said. \u0027They\u0027re here to protect you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who from?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me. At least that\u0027s how it\u0027s supposed to go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I don\u0027t need any protection from you. That doesn\u0027t make any sense.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They think you might,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027But that is not the worst of it.\u0027\\n\\n The creatures were circling and the other passengers, sharing the endemic Ankh-Morpork taste for impromptu street theatre, had piled out and had become an appreciative audience, which clearly discomforted the Sisters.\\n\\n \u0027What is the worst of it, then?\u0027 said Glenda, waving the pipe at the nearest Sister, which jumped back out of the way.\\n\\n \u0027They may be right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, so you\u0027re an orc,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027So they used to eat people. Have you eaten anyone lately?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Mister Trev.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, there you are, then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t arrest someone for something he hasn\u0027t done,\u0027 said one of the bus passengers, nodding sagely. \u0027A fundamental law, that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s an orc?\u0027 said the lady next to him.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, back in the olden days up in Uberwald or somewhere they used to tear people to bits and eat them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s foreigners for you,\u0027 said the woman.\\n\\n \u0027But they\u0027re all dead now,\u0027 said the man.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s nice,\u0027 said the woman. \u0027Would anyone like some tea? I\u0027ve got a flask.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All dead, except me. But I am afraid that I am an orc,\u0027 said Nutt. He looked up at Glenda. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he said. \u0027You have been very kind, but I can see that being an orc will follow me around. There will be trouble. I would hate you to be involved.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027\\n\\n The woman unscrewed the top of her flask. \u0027But you\u0027re not about to eat anyone, are you, dear? If you feel really hungry I\u0027ve got some macaroons.\u0027 She looked at the nearest Sister and said, \u0027What about you, love? I know none of us can help how we\u0027re made, but how come you\u0027ve been made to look like a chicken?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Danger! Danger!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dunno about that,\u0027 said another passenger. \u0027I don\u0027t reckon he\u0027s going to do anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Please, please,\u0027 said Nutt. There was a box lying on the road beside him. He tore it open frantically and started to pull things out of it.\\n\\n They were candles. Knocking them over in his haste, picking them up in shaking fingers only to knock them over again, he finally had them upright on the flints of the road. He pulled matches out of another pocket, knelt down and once again got his shaking fingers tangled in themselves as he struggled to strike a match. Tears streamed down his face as the light of the candles rose.\\n\\n Rose... and changed.\\n\\n Blues, yellows, greens. They would go out for a few smoky seconds and then light again a different colour, to the oohs and aahs of the crowd.\\n\\n \u0027See! See!\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027You like them? You like them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think you could make yourself a lot of money out of that,\u0027 said one of the passengers.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re lovely,\u0027 said the old lady. \u0027Honestly, the things you young people can do today.\u0027\\n\\n Nutt turned to the nearest Sister and spat, \u0027I am not worthless, I have worth.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My brother-in-law runs a novelty shop down in the smoke,\u0027 said the erstwhile expert in orcs. \u0027I\u0027ll write his address down for you if you like? But I reckon that thing would go down very well on the kiddies\u0027 birthday circuit.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda had watched all of this open-mouthed, as the kind of democracy practised by reasonable and amiable but not very clever people, the people whose education had never involved a book but had involved lots of other people, surrounded Nutt in its invisible, beneficent arms.\\n\\n It was heartwarming, but Glenda\u0027s heart was a little bit calloused on this score. It was the crab bucket at its best. Sentimental and forgiving; but get it wrong�Cone wrong word, one wrong liaison, one wrong thought�Cand those nurturing arms could so easily end in fists. Nutt was right: at best, being an orc was to live under a threat.\\n\\n \u0027You lot have got no right treating the poor little devil like that,\u0027 said the old lady, waving a finger at the nearest Sister. \u0027If you want to live here, you have to do things our way, all right? And that means no pecking at people. That\u0027s not how we do things in Ankh-Morpork.\u0027\\n\\n Even Glenda smiled at that one. Pecking was a picnic compared with what Ankh-Morpork could offer.\\n\\n \u0027Vetinari\u0027s letting all sorts in these days,\u0027 said another passenger. \u0027I won\u0027t hear a word said against the dwarfs - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good,\u0027 said a voice at his back. He moved aside and Glenda saw the dwarf standing behind him.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, mate, I didn\u0027t see you there, what with you being so little,\u0027 said the man who had nothing against dwarfs. \u0027As I was saying, you lot just settle down and get on with it and are no trouble to anybody, but we\u0027re getting some weird ones now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That woman they put in the Watch last month, for one,\u0027 said the old lady. \u0027The weird one from out Ephebe way. Gust of wind caught her sunglasses and three people turned into stone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She was a Medusa,\u0027 said Glenda, who had read about that in the Times. \u0027The wizards managed to turn them back again, though.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, what I\u0027m saying is,\u0027 started the man who had nothing against dwarfs, \u0027we don\u0027t mind anyone, so long as they mind their own business and don\u0027t do any funny stuff.\u0027\\n\\n This was the rhythm of the world to Glenda; she\u0027d heard it so many times. But the feeling of the crowd was now very much against the Sisters. Sooner or later somebody was going to pick up a stone. \u0027I\u0027d get out of here now,\u0027 she said, \u0027get out and go back to the lady you work for. I should do that right now, if I were you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027 one of them screeched.\\n\\n But there were brains in those strange-shaped heads. And the three Sisters were clearly bright enough to want to keep them there and ran for it, hopping and leaping like herons until what seemed like cloaks turned out to be wings, which pounded on the air as they sought for height. There was a final scream of \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027\\n\\n The driver of the horse bus coughed. \u0027Well, if that\u0027s all sorted out then I suggest you all get back on board, please, ladies and gentlemen. And whoever. And don\u0027t forget your candles, mister.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda helped Nutt on to a wooden seat. He was holding his toolbox tightly across his knees, as if it would offer some sort of protection. \u0027Where were you trying to go?\u0027 she said as the horses began to move.\\n\\n \u0027Home,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027Back to Her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She gave me worth,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I was nothing and she gave me worth.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How can you say you were nothing?\u0027 said Glenda. On the pair of seats in front of them, Trev and Juliet were whispering together.\\n\\n \u0027I was nothing,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I knew nothing, I understood nothing, I had no understanding, I had no skill - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027But that doesn\u0027t mean someone is worthless,\u0027 said Glenda firmly.\\n\\n \u0027It does,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027But it does not mean they are bad. I was worthless. She showed me how to gain worth and now I have worth.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda had a feeling they were working from two different dictionaries. \u0027What does \"worth\" mean, Mister Nutt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It means that you leave the world better than when you found it,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027Good point,\u0027 said the lady with the macaroons. \u0027There\u0027s far too many people around the place who wouldn\u0027t dream of doing a hand\u0027s turn.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, but what about people who\u0027re blind, for example?\u0027 This from the hardboiled-egg man, sitting on the other side of the bus.\\n\\n \u0027I know a blind bloke in Sto Lat who runs a bar,\u0027 said an elderly gentleman. \u0027Knows where everything is and when you put your money on the counter he knows if it\u0027s the right change just by listening. He does all right. It\u0027s amazing, he can pick out a dud sixpence halfway across a noisy bar.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think there are absolutes,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I think what Ladyship meant was that you do the best you can with what you have.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sounds like a sensible lady,\u0027 said the man who had nothing against dwarfs.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s a vampire,\u0027 said Glenda maliciously.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing against vampires, just so long as they keep themselves to themselves,\u0027 said the macaroon lady, who was now engaged in licking something revoltingly pink. \u0027We\u0027ve got one working down at the kosher butcher\u0027s on our street, and she\u0027s as nice as you like.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s about what you end up with,\u0027 said the dwarf. \u0027It\u0027s about what you end up with compared with what you started with.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda leaned back with a smile as attempts at philosophy bounced their way from seat to seat. She wasn\u0027t at all certain about the whole thing, but Nutt was sitting there looking far less bedraggled and the rest of them were treating him as one of themselves.\\n\\n There were dim lights ahead in the darkness. Glenda slipped from her seat and went up ahead to the driver. \u0027Are we nearly there yet?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Another five minutes,\u0027 said the driver.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry about all that silly business with the lead pipe,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t happen,\u0027 said the man cheerfully. \u0027Believe me, we get all sorts on the night bus. At least no one\u0027s thrown up. Quite an interestin\u0027 lad you\u0027ve got back there with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve no idea,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027Of course, all he\u0027s saying is you\u0027ve got to do your best,\u0027 said the driver. \u0027And the more best you\u0027re capable of, the more you should do. That\u0027s it, really.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda nodded. That did seem to be it, really. \u0027Do you go straight back?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027No. Me and the horses are stopping here and will go back in the morning.\u0027 He gave her the wry look of a man who\u0027s heard a great many things, and surprisingly seen a great many things, when to those behind him he was just a head facing forward keeping an eye on the road. \u0027That was a wonderful kiss she give me. I\u0027ll tell you what, the bus will be in the yard, there\u0027s plenty of straw around and if anyone was to have a bit of a kip, I wouldn\u0027t know about it, would I? We\u0027ll leave at six with fresh horses.\u0027 He grinned at her expression. \u0027I told you, we get all sorts on the late-night bus: kids running away from home, wives running away from husbands, husbands running away from other wives\u0027 husbands. It\u0027s called an omnibus, see, and omni means everything and damn near everything happens on this bus, that\u0027s why I have the axe, see? But the way I see it, life can\u0027t be all axe.\u0027 He raised his voice: \u0027Sto Lat coming up, folks! Return trip six o\u0027clock prompt.\u0027 He winked at Glenda. \u0027And if you\u0027re not there, I\u0027ll go withoutcha,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ve got to catch the bus at bus-catching time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, this hasn\u0027t been so bad, has it?\u0027 said Glenda, as the lights of the city grew bigger.\\n\\n \u0027My dad\u0027s going to fret,\u0027 said Juliet.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll think you\u0027re with me.\u0027\\n\\n Trev said nothing. By the rules of the street, being exposed in front of your want-to-be girlfriend as the kind of man who can so easily be seen not to be the kind of man that would have the guts to belt someone over the head with a length of lead pipe was extremely shaming, although no one seemed to have noticed this.\\n\\n \u0027Looks like a bit of trouble ahead,\u0027 the driver called back. \u0027The Lancre Flyer ain\u0027t gone.\u0027\\n\\n All they could see were flares and lantern lights, illuminating the big coaching inn outside the city gate, where several coaches were standing. As they drew nearer, he called to one of the skinny, bandy-legged and weaselly-looking men who seemed to self-generate around any establishment that involved the movement of horses. \u0027Flyer not gone?\u0027 he enquired.\\n\\n The weaselly man removed a cigarette end from his mouth. \u0027 \u0027orse frowed a shoe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well? They\u0027ve got a smith \u0027ere, ain\u0027t they? Speed the mails and all that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s not speedin\u0027 nuffink on account of him just laminating his hand to the anvil,\u0027 said the man.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027ll be the devil to pay if the Flyer don\u0027t go,\u0027 said the driver. \u0027That\u0027s post, that is. You should be able to set your watch by the Flyer.\u0027\\n\\n Nutt stood up. \u0027I could certainly re-shoe a horse for you, sir,\u0027 he said, picking up his wooden toolbox. \u0027Perhaps you had better go and tell someone.\u0027\\n\\n The man sidled off and the bus came to rest in the big yard, where a rather better dressed man came hurrying up. \u0027One of you a smith?\u0027 he enquired, looking directly at Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027Me,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n The man stared. \u0027You don\u0027t look much like a smith, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Contrary to popular belief, most smiths are on the wiry side rather than bulky. It\u0027s all a matter of sinews rather than muscle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you know your way around an anvil, do you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You would be amazed, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s shoes in the smithy,\u0027 said the man. \u0027You\u0027ll have to work one to size.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know how to do that,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Mister Trev, I would be glad if you would come and help me with the bellows.\u0027\\n\\n The inn was huge and crowded, because as with coaching inns everywhere its day lasted for twenty-four hours and not a moment less. There were no meal times, as such. Hot food for those who could afford it was available all the time and cold cuts of meat were on a large trestle in the main room. People arrived, were emptied and refilled in the speediest time possible and sent on their way again because the space was needed for the next arrivals. There never seemed to be a moment without the jangle of harnesses. Glenda found a quiet corner. \u0027I tell you what,\u0027 she said to Juliet, \u0027go and fetch some sandwiches for the lads.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fancy Mister Nutt being a blacksmith,\u0027 said Juliet.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s a man of many parts,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n Juliet\u0027s brow wrinkled. \u0027\u0027ow many parts?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just a figure of speech, Juliet. Off you go now.\u0027 She needed time to think. Those strange flying women. Mister Nutt. It was all a lot to take. You start the day and it\u0027s just another day and here you are, having mercifully not ended up as a highwayman, sitting in another city with nothing more than the clothes you\u0027re standing up in, not knowing what is going to happen next.\\n\\n Which, in a way, was exciting. She had to analyse that feeling for several moments because excitement was not a regular feature of her life. Pies, on the whole, do not excite. She got up and wandered unheeded through the crowds, with the vague idea of seeing what the kitchens were like, but found her path blocked by someone whose sweating face, flustered air and rotund body suggested he was the innkeeper. \u0027If you could just wait a moment, ma\u0027am,\u0027 he said to her and then addressed a woman who was emerging from what looked like a private dining room. \u0027So nice to see you again, your ladyship,\u0027 he said, bobbing up and down a little. \u0027It\u0027s always an honour to have you grace our humble establishment.\u0027\\n\\n Ladyship.\\n\\n Glenda looked up at the woman who was everything she had pictured when Nutt had first talked about her. Tall, thin, dark, forbidding, to be feared. Her expression was stern and she said, in what to Glenda were posh tones, \u0027Far too noisy in here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But the beef was superb,\u0027 said another voice and Glenda realized that Ladyship had almost eclipsed a smaller woman, quite pleasant, not particularly tall and with a slightly fussy air about her.\\n\\n \u0027Are you Lady Margolotta?\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n The tall lady gave her a look of brief disdain and swept on towards the main doors, but her companion stopped and said, \u0027Do you have business with her ladyship?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is she coming to Ankh-Morpork?\u0027 Glenda asked. \u0027Everybody knows she\u0027s Lord Vetinari\u0027s squeeze.\u0027 She felt instantly embarrassed as she said the word; it conjured up images that simply could not fit into the available space in her brain.\\n\\n \u0027Really?\u0027 said the woman. \u0027They are certainly very close friends.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I want to talk to her about Mister Nutt,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n The woman gave her a worried look and pulled her over to an empty bench. \u0027There has been a problem?\u0027 she said, sitting down and patting the wood beside her.\\n\\n \u0027She told him he was worthless,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And sometimes I think all he worries about is being worthy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you worthy?\u0027 said the woman.\\n\\n \u0027What sort of question is that to ask a stranger?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An interesting and possibly revealing one. Do you think the world is a better place with you in it, and would you do me the courtesy of actually thinking about your answer rather than pulling one off the \"affronted\" rack? I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s far too much of that these days. People believe that acting and thinking are the same thing.\u0027\\n\\n Faced with that, Glenda settled for, \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve made it better, have you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. I\u0027ve helped lots of people and I invented the Ploughman\u0027s Pie.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did the people you helped want to be helped?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What? Yes, they came and asked.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. And the Ploughman\u0027s Pie?\u0027\\n\\n Glenda told her.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, you must be the cook at Unseen University,\u0027 said the woman. \u0027Which means that you have access to rather more than the average cook and, therefore, I would deduce that to keep the pickled onions crisp in the pie you put them in a cold room at very nearly freezing point for some time immediately before baking, possibly wrapping them in cheese for the sake of temporary insulation, and, if you have assembled your pie correctly and paid attention to temperatures, I think that would do the trick.\u0027 She paused. \u0027Hello?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you a cook?\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027Good grief, no!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you worked it out, just like that? Mister Nutt told me her ladyship employs very clever people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m embarrassed to say it, but that is true.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But she shouldn\u0027t have told Mister Nutt that he\u0027s worthless. She shouldn\u0027t say that to people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he was worthless, yes? He couldn\u0027t even talk properly when he was found. Surely what she has done has helped him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he frets all the time and it\u0027s got out now that he\u0027s an orc. What\u0027s that all about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And is he, in your mind, doing anything particularly orcish?\u0027\\n\\n Reluctantly, Glenda said, \u0027Sometimes his fingernails turn into claws.\u0027\\n\\n The woman looked suddenly concerned. \u0027And what does he do then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, nothing,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027They just sort of... go back in again. But he makes wonderful candles,\u0027 she added quickly. \u0027He\u0027s always making things. It\u0027s as if... worth is something that drains away all the time so you have to keep topping it up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Possibly, now you put it that way, she has been a little too brisk with him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does she love him?\u0027 asked Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027I beg your pardon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I mean, has anyone ever loved him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I think she does, in her way,\u0027 said the woman. \u0027Although she\u0027s a vampire, you know. They tend to see the world rather differently.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, if I met her I\u0027d give her a piece of my mind,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Muddling him about. Setting those wretched flying ladies on him. I wouldn\u0027t let her do that sort of thing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s immensely strong, I\u0027m led to believe,\u0027 said the woman.\\n\\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t give her the right,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And shall I tell you something? Mister Nutt is right here. Oh yes, out in the yard, shoeing one of the horses for the Lancre Flyer. He really is amazing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It sounds like it,\u0027 said the woman with a faint little smile. \u0027You certainly seem to be a vehement supporter.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda hesitated. \u0027Is that something to do with foxes?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027It means with great passion,\u0027 said the woman. \u0027Do you have a great passion for Mister Nutt, Miss Sugarbean? And remember, please, I do like people to do me the honour of thinking before they speak.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I like him a lot,\u0027 said Glenda hotly.\\n\\n \u0027That is charming,\u0027 said the woman. \u0027It does occur to me that Mister Nutt might have achieved more worth than I had previously thought.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you tell her ladyship what I said,\u0027 said Glenda, feeling her neck on fire with blushes. \u0027Mister Nutt has got friends.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indeed I will,\u0027 said the woman, standing up. \u0027And now if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027m sure our coach is about to depart. I must fly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Remember to tell her what I said!\u0027 Glenda shouted after her.\\n\\n She saw the woman turn to smile at her and then she was lost as a party arriving from a new coach hurried in from the cold night air.\\n\\n Glenda, who had stood up at the same time as the woman, sat down heavily. Who on earth did that woman think she was? Her ladyship\u0027s librarian, probably. Nutt had mentioned her several times. Altogether too many ideas above her station for Glenda\u0027s liking. She hadn\u0027t even had the decency to give Glenda her name.\\n\\n The faint, distant hunting horns of sheer terror began to sound in the back of her mind. Had the woman asked Glenda her name? No! But she\u0027d certainly known it and how would she know about the \u0027cook\u0027 at Unseen University? And she\u0027d been so quick, she\u0027d worked out the Ploughman\u0027s Pie with a snap of her fingers. That little part of her that had first been liberated by the sherry chimed in with, The trouble with you is that you make assumptions. You see something and you think you know what you\u0027ve seen. She certainly didn\u0027t sound like a librarian, did she?\\n\\n Very slowly, Glenda raised her right hand into a fist and lowered it into her mouth, and bit down very hard in an attempt to somehow retrieve the last fifteen minutes from the records of the universe and replace them with something far less embarrassing, like her knickers falling down.\\n\\n Even here, late into the night, the forge was the heart of attention. Coaches were arriving and leaving constantly. The inn did not run according to the sun, it ran according to the timetable, and aimless people waiting for their connections gravitated to the forge as a free show and a place of comfort in the chilly night air.\\n\\n Nutt was shoeing a horse. Trev had seen horses being shod before, but never like this. The animal stood as if transfixed, trembling very slightly. When Nutt wanted it to move, he clicked his tongue. When he wanted its leg raised, another click caused this to happen. Trev felt that he wasn\u0027t watching a man shoeing a horse, but a master demonstrating his skills to a world of amateurs. When the shoe was on, the horse walked backwards in front of the crowd, for all the world like a fashion model, turning as Nutt moved a hand or made a clicking noise. It didn\u0027t seem to be a particularly happy horse, but, great heavens, it was certainly an obedient one. \u0027Yes, that all seems fine,\u0027 Nutt said.\\n\\n \u0027How much is that going to cost us?\u0027 said the coachman. \u0027Wonderful job, if I may say so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How much? How much? How much?\u0027 said Nutt, turning it over in his mind. \u0027Have I earned worth, sir?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I should say so, mate. I\u0027ve never seen a horse shod as smooth as that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then worth will do,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027And a ride for myself and my three friends back to Ankh-Morpork.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An\u0027 five dollars,\u0027 said Trev, coming away from his lounging spot near the wall with the speed of money.\\n\\n The coachman sniffed. \u0027A bit steep,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027For a late-night job? To better than Burleigh and Stronginthearm specification? Not a bad deal, I think.\u0027\\n\\n A murmur from the other watchers backed Trev up. \u0027I never seen anyone do anything like that,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027He\u0027d \u0027ave \u0027ad that \u0027orse dancing if you\u0027d asked \u0027im.\u0027\\n\\n The coachman winked at Trev. \u0027All right, lad. What can I say? Old Havacook there is a good lad, but a bit bad tempered, as it goes. Once kicked a coachman through the wall. I never thought I\u0027d see him stand there and lift \u0027is leg up like a trained lap-dog. Your chum has earned his money and his ride.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Please take him away,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027But hold him with care because when he gets a little way away from me he might get a tiny bit frisky.\u0027\\n\\n The crowd dispersed. Nutt methodically damped down the forge and started to pack his tools into the box. \u0027If we\u0027re going to go back, we\u0027d better go now. Has anyone seen Miss Glenda?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 said Glenda, advancing out of the shadows. \u0027Trev, you and Jools go and get us some seats on the coach. I need to talk to Mister Nutt.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Her ladyship was here,\u0027 said Glenda when they\u0027d gone.\\n\\n \u0027I would not be surprised,\u0027 said Nutt calmly, snapping the catches shut on his box. \u0027Just about everybody passes through here and she travels a great deal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why were you running away?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because I know what will happen,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I am an orc. It\u0027s as simple as that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But the people on the bus were on your side,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n Nutt flexed his hands and the claws slid out, just for a moment. \u0027And tomorrow?\u0027 he said. \u0027And if something goes wrong? Everybody knows orcs will tear your arms off. Everybody knows orcs will tear your head off. Everybody knows these things. That is not good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, then, why are you coming back?\u0027 Glenda demanded.\\n\\n \u0027Because you are kind and came after me. How could I refuse? But it does not change the things that everybody knows.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But every time you make a candle and every time you shoe a horse, you change the things that everybody knows,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You know that orcs were - \u0027 She hesitated. \u0027Sort of made?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes, it was in the book.\u0027\\n\\n She nearly exploded. \u0027Well, then, why didn\u0027t you tell me?!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is it important? We are what we are now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you don\u0027t have to be!\u0027 Glenda yelled. \u0027Everybody knows trolls eat people and spit them out. Everybody knows dwarfs cut your legs off. But at the same time everybody knows that what everybody knows is wrong. And orcs didn\u0027t decide to be like they are. People will understand that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It will be a dreadful burden.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll help!\u0027 Glenda was shocked at the speed of her response and then mumbled, \u0027I\u0027ll help.\u0027\\n\\n The coals in the forge crackled as they settled down. Fires in a busy forge seldom die out completely. After a while, Glenda said, \u0027You wrote that poem for Trev, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Miss Glenda. I hope she liked it.\u0027\\n\\n Glenda thought she\u0027d better raise this carefully. \u0027I think I ought to tell you that she didn\u0027t understand a lot of the words exactly. I sort of had to translate it for her.\u0027 It hadn\u0027t been too difficult, she reckoned. Most love poems were pretty much the same under the curly writing.\\n\\n \u0027Did you like it?\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n \u0027It was a wonderful poem,\u0027 said Glenda.\\n\\n \u0027I wrote it for you,\u0027 said Nutt. He was looking at her with an expression that stirred together fear and defiance in equal measure.\\n\\n The cooling embers brightened up at this. After all, a forge has a soul. As if they had been waiting there, the responses lined themselves up in front of Glenda\u0027s tongue. Whatever you do next is going to be very important, she told herself. Really, extremely, very important. Don\u0027t start wondering about what Mary the bloody housemaid would do in one of those cheap novels you read, because Mary was made up by someone with a name suspiciously like an anagram for people like you. She is not real and you are.\\n\\n \u0027We had better get on the coach,\u0027 said Nutt, picking up his box.\\n\\n Glenda gave up on the thinking and burst into tears. It has to be said that they were not the gentle tears they would have been from Mary the housemaid, but the really big long-drawn-out blobby ones you get from someone who very rarely cries. They were gummy, with a hint of snot in there as well. But they were real. Mary the housemaid would just not have been able to match them.\\n\\n So, of course, it will be just like Trev Likely to turn up out of the shadows and say, \u0027They\u0027re calling the coach now - Are you two all right?\u0027\\n\\n Nutt looked at Glenda. Tears aren\u0027t readily retractable, but she managed to balance a smile on them. \u0027I believe this to be the case,\u0027 said Nutt.\\n\\n Travelling on a fast coach, on even a mild autumn night, those passengers on the roof experience the temperature that can freeze doorknobs. There are leather covers and rugs of various age, thickness and smell. Survival is only possible by wrapping yourself in the biggest cocoon you can achieve, preferably with somebody else next to you; two people can heat up faster than one. In theory, all of this could lead to hanky panky, but the seats of the coach and the rockiness of the road mean that such things are not uppermost in the traveller\u0027s mind, which dreams longingly of cushions. Furthermore, there was a fine rain now.\\n\\n Juliet craned her head to look at the seats behind, but there were just the mounds of damp rugs that were the coach company\u0027s answer to the cold night air. \u0027You don\u0027t think they\u0027re sweet on each other, do you?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Trev, who was himself cocooned in rugs, only managed a grunt, but then went on, \u0027I think \u0027e admires her. He always seems a bit tongue-tied when \u0027e\u0027s near her, that\u0027s all I know.\u0027\\n\\n This had to be a romance, Glenda thought. It wasn\u0027t like the ones peddled every week by Iradne Comb-Buttworthy. It felt more real�Cmore real and very, very strange. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-15.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) \\n The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. \\n Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .).
