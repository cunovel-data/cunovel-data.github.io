{"id":94968,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"By the time Lance-Constable Bluejohn of the Watch and two other trolls had forcibly prised open the gates against the pressure of bodies, the noise was just one great hammer of sound. The troll officers opened a path for them with the forethought and delicacy that has made police crowd control such a byword. It led to a fenced-off and heavily guarded area, in the centre of which was the Archchancellor formerly known as Dean, the entire team of Ankh-Morpork United and His Grace the Duke of Ankh, Commander of the City Watch, Sir Samuel Vimes, with a face like a bad lunch. \u0027What the hell are you clowns proposing to do to my city?\u0027 he demanded and looked up at Vetinari in his box in the middle of the stand. He raised his voice. \u0027I\u0027ve been grafting like mad this last month on getting the KV Accord sorted out and it turns out that just when the dwarfs and the trolls are shaking hands and being jolly good pals, you lot are starting another KV of your very own.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, come now, Sam,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027It\u0027s only a jolly day out.\u0027\n \u0027People are queueing up at the gates,\u0027 said Vimes. \u0027The actual city gates. How much of this is magical?\u0027\n \u0027None, Sam, as far as we\u0027re aware. There will be no magic used during the game, this has been discussed and agreed and the D - \u0027 Ridcully swallowed hard. \u0027The Archchancellor of Brazeneck University is making himself responsible for thaumic damping of the stadium.\u0027\n \u0027Then let me tell you this,\u0027 said the commander. \u0027None of my men will set a foot on the field of play, no matter what happens. Do I make myself clear?\u0027\n \u0027As crystal, Sam.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, Archchancellor, for now I am Commander of the City Watch, not Sam, if it\u0027s all the same to you,\u0027 said Vimes. \u0027The whole damn city is an accident waiting to - no, an accident that already has happened and anything that goes bad will get worse very quickly. I\u0027m not going to have it said that the Watch were the problem. Honestly, Mustrum, I really would have expected better from you.\u0027\n \u0027That will be Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ridcully coldly.\n \u0027As far as I\u0027m concerned,\u0027 said Vimes, \u0027this is a scuffle between rival gangs. Do you know what my job is, Archchancellor? It\u0027s to keep the peace, and for two pins, I\u0027d arrest the whole boiling of ya, but his lordship won\u0027t have it.\u0027\n Ridcully coughed. \u0027May I extend my congratulations, sir, on the very good work you have been doing in Koom Valley.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Vimes. \u0027And so I suspect you can imagine how cheerful I am to see you involved in another kind of war.\u0027 The commander turned to Archchancellor Henry. \u0027Nice to see you again, sir, it\u0027s good to see that you\u0027ve moved up in the world. I\u0027m formally telling you that I am laying down the law, here, and as the referee, you have to pick it up. Inside these lines it\u0027s football�Cstep over the line and it\u0027s me.\u0027 He turned back to Ridcully. \u0027Mind how you go, Archchancellor.\u0027\n He departed, watchmen falling into place behind him.\n \u0027Well, now, I suspect the good commander has a lot on his mind these days,\u0027 said Archchancellor Henry, brightly. He pulled out his watch. \u0027I would like to speak to the team captains.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I know I\u0027m one of them,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n A man stepped forward from the ranks of United.\n \u0027Joseph Hoggett, of the Pork Packers, as it happens. Captain, for my sins.\u0027\n Hoggett held out his hand to Ridcully and, to his credit, hardly winced when it was taken in a firm handshake.\n \u0027Well, gentlemen,\u0027 said the former Dean. \u0027I am sure you know the rules, we\u0027ve been through them often enough. I want a good clean game. One long, er, peep from my whistle means that I am interrupting play for an infringement or injury or for some other reason at that point known only to myself. One even longer peep, which I suppose will be more of a parrp, will mean the end of one half and time for refreshment, after which the game will recommence. During the interval, I believe that there will be a marching display by the Ankh-Morpork accordion band, but I suppose these things are sent to try us. May I remind you gentlemen that you change ends at the half-time. Also, please impress on your team that the goal they are aiming for should not be behind them. If I see any serious infringement, that player will be removed from the pitch. A considerably longer parrp, which as far as I am concerned will continue until I am out of breath, will mark the end of the game. May I also remind you, as Commander Vimes has reminded us, that within these four, rather sticky lines of chalk, I am a wielder of power second only to the gods themselves, and then only perhaps. If at any time it becomes clear that the rules themselves are impractical, I will change them. When I blow the whistle, I shall raise my staff and unleash a spell which will prevent any further magic being used within these hallowed lines until the close of play. Is that understood?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said Mr Hoggett.\n \u0027Mustrum?\u0027 said the former Dean, in a meaningful voice.\n \u0027Yes, yes, all right,\u0027 grumbled Ridcully. \u0027You are making the most of your little moment, aren\u0027t you? Let\u0027s get on with it, shall we?\u0027\n \u0027Gentlemen, would you please form up your teams for the singing of the National Anthem. Mister Stibbons, I believe you have found me a megaphone, thank you very much.\u0027 He raised the horn to his lips and shouted through it, \u0027Ladies and gentlemen, be upstanding for the National Anthem.\u0027\n The singing of the National Anthem was always a ragged affair, the good people of Ankh-Morpork feeling that it was unpatriotic to sing songs about how patriotic you were, taking the view that someone singing a song about how patriotic they were was either up to something or a Head of State.\n An additional problem today lay in the acoustics of the arena, which were rather too good, coupled with the fact that the speed of sound at one end of the stadium was slightly off beat compared with the other end, a drawback exacerbated when both sides tried to recover the gap.\n These acoustical anomalies did not count for much if you were standing next to Mustrum Ridcully, as the Archchancellor was one of those gentlemen who will sing it beautifully, correctly enunciated and very, very loudly.\n \u0027\"When dragons belch and hippos flee, my thoughts, Ankh-Morpork, are of thee,\"\u0027 he began.\n Trev noticed, to his surprise, that Nutt was standing stiffly to attention. His own mouth operating on automatic, he looked along the massed rank of Ankh-Morpork United. About fifty-fifty, he thought. Half of them decent old cloggers and half of them Andy and his chums. His gaze lighted on Andy just as he thought that and Andy flashed him a little smile and pointed a finger briefly. But I\u0027m not playing, Trev thought, because of my old mum. He glanced down at the palm of his hand, no star there, he was sure of that. Anyway, he thought, staring at the opponents, when it all goes bad the referee is a wizard, after all.\n \u0027\"Let others boast of martial dash, for we have boldly fought with cash,\"\u0027 roared the crowd at various pitches and speeds.\n I mean, Trev thought, he wouldn\u0027t switch off his own magic, would he?\n \u0027\"We own all your helmets, we own all your shoes.\"\u0027\n I mean, he really wouldn\u0027t do that, would he? The only person who could stop it if it all went wrong wouldn\u0027t have made a mistake like that?\n \u0027\"We own all your generals�Ctouch us and you\u0027ll lose.\"\u0027\n Yes, he has done! He has done just that!\n \u0027\"Morporkia! Morporkia! Morporkia owns the day,\"\u0027 Trev shouted to quell his own rising panic. He has done that, we all saw him! He\u0027s kept his own staff inside the field where you can\u0027t do magic. He looked at Andy and Andy nodded. Yes, he had worked it out as well.\n \u0027\"We can rule you wholesale. Touch us and you\u0027ll pay.\"\u0027\n It is considered in the Sto Plains that only scoundrels know the second verse of their national anthem, since anyone spending time memorizing that would be up to no good purpose. The Ankh-Morpork national anthem, therefore, had a second verse that was deliberately written as ner ner ners and the occasional coherent word desperately trying to stay afloat, on the basis that this is how it would sound in any case. Trev listened to it with even more agony than usual.\n But everyone joined in cheerful unison for the last line, which everybody knew, \u0027\"We can rule you wholesale, credit where it\u0027s due.\"\u0027\n Glenda, one arm as far across her bosom as it would go, risked a look at what would still probably be called the Royal Box, just as Vetinari raised the gold-ish coloured urn and a cheer went up. Ankh-Morpork was not particularly keen on cheering the Patrician but it would cheer money any day of the week. Yet it seemed to Glenda that there was some strange harmonic to the cheer, coming up from under the ground itself, as if the place was one huge mouth... Then the feeling went away. And the day came back.\n \u0027Gentlemen? Team players to their places,\u0027 said the Archchancellor of Brazeneck, haughtily.\n \u0027Er, can I have a word with you, sir?\u0027 said Trev, sidling up as quickly as possible.\n \u0027Ah, yes. Dave Likely\u0027s boy,\u0027 said the former Dean. \u0027We are about to play football, Mister Likely, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve noticed.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir, well, er, but... \u0027\n \u0027Do you know of any good reason why I should hold up the game?\u0027 the referee demanded.\n Trev gave up.\n Henry produced a coin from his waistcoat pocket. \u0027Mustrum?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Heads,\u0027 said the Archchancellor, and he turned out to be wrong.\n \u0027Very well, Mister Hoggett... and who has the ball?\u0027\n Gloing! Gloing!\n Nutt picked the ball out of the air and handed it over. \u0027Me, sir.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, you are the coach for the Academicals.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but a player as well should it become necessary.\u0027\n \u0027Gentlemen, you will see that I am placing the ball in the centre of the pitch.\u0027 It\u0027s true that the Archchancellor formerly known as Dean did rather relish the occasion. He took a few steps back, paused for dramatic effect, produced a whistle from his pocket and flourished it. He gave a blow that only a man of that size could give; his face began to twitch and go red. He raised his megaphone to his lips and shouted, \u0027ANY BOY WHO HAS NOT BROUGHT HIS KIT WILL PLAY IN HIS PANTS!\u0027 followed by Ponder Stibbons shouting, \u0027I want to know who gave that to him!\u0027\n The crowd roared and you could hear the laugh going away in the distance, rolling down the streets as every listener in the crowded city passed it on, bringing back such memories that at least two people started to forge letters from their mother.\n In his goal, the Librarian swung himself to the top of his posts to get a better look. In his goal, Charlie Barton, goalkeeper for United, methodically lit his pipe. And the man with the biggest problem within the ground that day apart possibly from Trev, was the editor of the Times, Mr William de Worde, who had not trusted any underling with the reporting of this unique, most prestigious occasion, but wasn\u0027t at all sure how it should be done.\n At the whistle, he\u0027d managed: The United chief, should I say chief? There must be a better word for him, but I can sort that out in the office, does not actually appear to know what to do next. Archchancellor Ridcully (BF, No, no, I\u0027ll fill that in later) has kicked the ball hard towards, well, actually it has hit Jimmy Wilkins, formerly of the Miners, who seems uncertain as to what to do with it. No, no, he\u0027s picked it up! He\u0027s picked up the ball! The referee, who is the former Dean of Unseen University, has called him over for what I imagine is to be a refresher course in the rules of this new game of football.\n A megaphone, thought de Worde, that\u0027s what I need, an extremely big megaphone so I can tell everyone what\u0027s going on. The ball has been handed to, let me see, number sixty-nine, oh yes, the multi-talented Professor Bengo Macarona, who according to the regulations, the new rules, is allowed what is known as a free kick from where the infringement took place and it\u0027s, and here comes, Bengo Maca - sorry, Professor Bengo Macarona for Unseen Academicals and - oh my word! It has gone right down the pitch at shoulder height, making a noise like a partridge (check with Nature Notes correspondence on whether I have the correct simile). The ball has hit Mr Charlie \u0027Big Boy\u0027 Barton in the stomach with such force as to carry him into the back of the net! What a display! And this would appear to be a goal! At least one goal, I should think! And the crowd are on their feet, though technically most of them were there already, anyhow [he wrote conscientiously, with a journalist\u0027s well-known desire to get things right]. And yes, they are celebrating the hero of the moment and the refrain coming from the lips of the Academicals\u0027 supporters in their unique patois seems to be: \u0027One Makaronah, there\u0027s only one Makaronah, one Makaro-naah.\u0027 No, no. Something seems to be happening; Macarona has left the pitch and is talking animatedly to the crowd. He appears to be haranguing them. Those he has been talking to look subdued.\n At this point, one of the editor\u0027s assistants hurried over with a brief digest of what had transpired on the other side of the pitch. De Worde wrote quickly, hoping that his home-made shorthand would not fail him: With that hot-blooded resolve that is so lovably typical of the native Genuan, Professor Macarona is apparently insisting that any celebratory chanting should include his full name and full list of honours and is helpfully writing them down. There also appears to be a bit of a hiatus around United\u0027s goal as some of Charlie Barton\u0027s team mates help him find his pipe and also, it transpires [the editor of the Times liked the word transpire], the other half of the pork pie it transpired he had been eating at the time the goal was scored. It appears that, not unlike many of us, he had underestimated the speed of the new ball. And now the ball appears to be back in the centre of the pitch where there is another argument going on.\n \u0027But they\u0027ve just scored a goal!\u0027 said Mr Hoggett.\n \u0027Yes, quite so,\u0027 said the former Dean, wheezing gently. \u0027That means that they get to kick off next.\u0027\n \u0027That means we don\u0027t, but we\u0027ve just lost a goal!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but that\u0027s what the rules say.\u0027\n \u0027But that\u0027s not fair, we want a kick, they kicked it last.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s not about the kicks, Mister Hoggett, it\u0027s what you do with them.\u0027 And Archchancellor Ridcully runs towards the ball. He turns swiftly and has kicked the ball towards his own goal!\n The editor wrote furiously: Almost all of United\u0027s team are running up to take advantage of this strange faux pas, not entirely cognisant [the editor liked that word, too, it was so much better than aware] but the famous Librarian of Unseen University has just -\n He stopped, blinked and grabbed one of his assistants who had turned up with a full list of Bengo Macarona\u0027s honours and pushed him down in the chair.\n \u0027Write down everything that I say!\u0027 he shouted. \u0027And I hope your shorthand is better than mine, and if it isn\u0027t you\u0027ll be sacked in the morning. This is insane!\u0027 They did it on purpose, I\u0027ll swear they did it on purpose. He kicked the ball directly at his own goalkeeper, knowing, I swear, that he could take advantage of the Librarian\u0027s renowned upper body strength to throw the ball almost the entire length of the pitch. And there is Bengo Macarona, more or less unnoticed by his opponents, heading towards the missile while United have streamed away from their citadel, like the ill-fated Maranids during the first Prodostian war [the editor liked to think of himself as a classicist].\n \u0027I\u0027ve never seen anything like it!\u0027 he shouted at his almost deafened assistant. \u0027They\u0027ve got United all in the wrong place.\u0027 And there goes Macarona. The ball appears to be attached to his feet. And there ahead of him appears to be the only member of the luckless United squad that knows what\u0027s going on. Mr Charles \u0027Big Boy\u0027 Barton, who nevertheless is staggering out of the goalmouth, like the Giant Octopal, upon seeing the hordes of the Mormidons.\n The editor fell silent, forgetting everything as the ground between the two men shortened by the moment. \u0027Oh, no!\u0027 he said.\n There was a huge cheer from the crowd. \u0027What happened?\u0027 said the assistant, pencil poised.\n \u0027Didn\u0027t you see it? Didn\u0027t you see it?\u0027 said the editor. His hair was dishevelled and he looked like a man nearing madness. \u0027Macarona ran round him! I don\u0027t know how the ball stayed at his feet.\u0027\n \u0027Do you mean he dodged past him, sir?\u0027 said the assistant.\n The noise of the crowd would have been incandescent had it been visible. \u0027Another goal,\u0027 said the editor slumping. \u0027Two goals in as many minutes! No, he didn\u0027t dodge him, he ran around him! Twice! And I\u0027ll swear, ended up going faster.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, yes,\u0027 said the assistant, still writing. \u0027I went to a lecture about that sort of thing, once. It was about how things don\u0027t hit the world turtle, sir. It was like a slingshot effect, he may have picked up additional speed as he rounded the goalkeeper\u0027s enormous girth, sir.\u0027\n \u0027And listen to the crowd roar!\u0027 said the editor. \u0027And write it down.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir, that would be: One Professor Macarona D. Thau (Bug), D. Maus (Chubb), Magistaludorum (QIS), Octavium (Hons), PHGK (Blit), DMSK, Mack, D. Thau (Bra), Visiting Professor in Chickens (Jahn the Conqueror University (Floor 2, Shrimp Packers Building, Genua)), Primo Octo (Deux), Visiting Professor of Blit/Slood Exchanges (Al Khali), KCbfJ, Reciprocating Professor of Blit Theory (Unki), D.

Thau (Unki), Didimus Supremius (Unki), Emeritus Professor in Blit Substrate Determinations (Chubb), Chair of Blit and Music Studies (Quirm College for Young Ladies). But wouldn\u0027t he be off-the-side, sir?\u0027\n \u0027That would indeed appear to be the complaint of the luckless warriors of United,\u0027 said the editor. \u0027They are clustering around the referee and what would I give to be a fly on that wall?\u0027\n \u0027There is no wall, sir.\u0027\n \u0027It would seem - \u0027 and the editor stopped dead. \u0027Who is that?\u0027\n \u0027What is that, sir?\u0027\n \u0027Look over there at the stands! The upper-class stands, I might add, to which we were not invited.\u0027\n The sun usefully took this opportunity to appear from behind the clouds and the bowl of the Hippo seemed to fill with light.\n \u0027That\u0027s the micromail girl, sir,\u0027 said the assistant.\n Even some of the protesting United team were looking up at the stands now. She hurt the eyes, but they were dragged towards it again.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got her picture on my bedroom wall,\u0027 said the assistant. \u0027Everyone has been looking for her.\u0027 He coughed. \u0027They say it doesn\u0027t chafe, you know.\u0027\n Now, all the footballers on the field, bar the unfortunate Charlie Barton, who was having a dizzy spell, were clustered around the referee, who said, \u0027I repeat; it was a perfectly acceptable goal. A trifle unkind and showy, perhaps, but nevertheless entirely within the rules. You\u0027ve watched the Unseen lads training. The game moves about. It doesn\u0027t send you a clacks to tell you what\u0027s happening next.\u0027\n A voice a little lower down said, \u0027It is an elementary mistake to believe that even the most doughty keeper of the net can single-handedly defend against the full might of the opposing team.\u0027 This was Nutt.\n \u0027Mister Nutt, you are not supposed to tell them that sort of thing,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n Mr Hoggett looked downcast. A man betrayed by team, history and expectations. \u0027I can see we\u0027ve got a lot to learn,\u0027 he said.\n Trev pulled Nutt off to one side. \u0027And this is where it all goes bad,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Oh, come now, Mister Trev. We\u0027re doing very well. Bengo is, anyway.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not watching him. I\u0027m watching Andy and Andy is watchin\u0027 Bengo. They\u0027re bidin\u0027 their time. They\u0027re lettin\u0027 the poor old buggers get into a hell of a fix and then they\u0027ll just take over.\u0027\n And then Trev was given a short lesson in why wizards are wizards.\n \u0027I have a modest proposal and I wonder if you will hear me out, referee. While we at Unseen University are absolute novices, we have had rather more time to get to grips with the new football than our current opponents have. Therefore, I propose to give them one of our goals,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027You can\u0027t do that, sir!\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Why, is it against the rules?\u0027 Ridcully\u0027s tone deepened and became noticeably more pompous. \u0027I ask you, are good sportsmanship, fellowship and generosity against the rules, pray?\u0027 By the end of the sentence, his voice was audible nearly to the very back of the stadium.\n \u0027Well, of course there is nothing against it, sir. There isn\u0027t a rule stopping you washing your laundry during the middle of the game-and that is because no one would do it.\u0027\n \u0027Right. Mister Hoggett? One of our goals is now yours. We are, as it were, level.\u0027\n Hoggett, transfixed, looked around at his fellow players, \u0027Well, er, if you insist, sir.\u0027\n \u0027Wouldn\u0027t dream of taking no for an answer,\u0027 said Ridcully expansively.\n \u0027What in the world made him do that?\u0027 said the editor of the Times, as an exhausted runner brought him the news.\n \u0027It was a very generous gesture.\u0027\n \u0027Why did you do it?\u0027 said Ponder to Ridcully.\n \u0027I am totally transparent, Stibbons. Generous to a fault, that\u0027s me. It\u0027s not my fault that they do not know they are inferior and this will play on their minds for the rest of the game.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s rather... cunning, sir.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, it is, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m rather proud of it. And once again, we get to kick first. No wonder this is such a popular game.\u0027\n \u0027That was a remarkable piece of psychology there,\u0027 said Nutt to Trev as they walked back to the sidelines. \u0027Somewhat cruel, possibly, but clever.\u0027\n Trev said nothing. There was the shrill call of the whistle for the game to resume, followed instantly by the referee screaming, \u0027A LITTLE BIT OF HAIL WON\u0027T HURT YOU, BOY, IT\u0027S HEALTHY AND WILL DO YOU GOOD.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s magic,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Should that be happening?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Ponder Stibbons behind him. \u0027It\u0027s just possession.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, the game is all about possession, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt.\n Trev looked up again at the stand. There was the shining shape of Juliet, only a few feet away from Vetinari himself and flanked by Glenda and Pepe. She could be a goddess. It\u0027s never going to happen, is it? he said to himself. Not her and a boy from the candle vats.\n Not really going to happen. Not now.\n And then Bengo screamed and it seemed as though every voice in the stadium joined in one communal \u0027OOOOOH!\u0027\n And the whistle blew again.\n \u0027What happened, sir?\u0027 said the editorial assistant.\n \u0027Can\u0027t exactly be sure. They got the ball to Macarona again and then he collided with a couple of United players and they all ended up in a heap.\u0027\n Nutt, the first to reach the stricken Macarona, looked up at Trev gravely. \u0027Both patellas dislocated,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ll need a couple of men to take him down to the Lady Sybil.\u0027\n The former Dean looked around at the clustered footballers. \u0027So, what happened here, Mister Shank?\u0027 he said as perspiration dripped off his chin.\n Andy momentarily lifted a finger to his forelock.\n \u0027Well, sir, I was rushing forward according to the rules to tackle Mister Macarona and I had no idea at all that Jimmy the Spoon, here, had got exactly the same idea and was coming from a different direction and suddenly we were all there together going arse over tip, if you would excuse my Klatchian.\u0027\n Trev glowered.\n The look on Andy\u0027s face was transparent. He was lying. He knew he was lying. He knew everyone else knew he was lying and he didn\u0027t care. In fact, he rather enjoyed the situation. Andy\u0027s boots looked heavy enough to moor a boat.\n \u0027They got \u0027im like the meat in a sandwich, sir,\u0027 Trev complained to the referee.\n \u0027Can you substantiate that, young man?\u0027\n \u0027Well, you can see what\u0027s happened to the poor bugger.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but do you have any evidence of collusion?\u0027\n Trev went blank and Nutt supplied in a whisper, \u0027Can you prove it was a set-up?\u0027\n \u0027Can anyone?\u0027 said the referee, looking around the players. No one could. Trev wondered how many might, were it not for the fact that Andy was standing there, innocent as a shark. \u0027I am the referee, gentlemen, and I can only referee what I see and I saw nothing.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, because they made sure of that,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Anyway, listen to the crowd. They all saw it!\u0027\n \u0027Look! They\u0027ve got boots on them that could strip bark,\u0027 Ridcully protested.\n \u0027Yes, indeed, Mustrum, I mean, sorry, captain, but as yet there are no rules about which boots should be worn and at the very least these are the boots that have been traditionally worn for the game of foot-the-ball.\u0027\n \u0027But they are man traps!\u0027\n \u0027I can certainly see what you are getting at, but what would you like me to do?\u0027 said Henry. \u0027I have a suspicion that if I cancel this match at this point you and I would not get out of here alive, because even if we ourselves did escape the wrath of the crowd, we would by no means escape the wrath of Vetinari. The game will continue. Unseen Academicals can play a substitute and I will, let me see - \u0027 He pulled out a notebook. \u0027Ah, yes, I will award a free kick at the very point where this unfortunate incident took place. And may I add that I will look askance at any future \"incidents\". Mister Hoggett, I trust that you will make this clear to your team.\u0027\n \u0027Blow that for a game of soldiers!\u0027 Trev yelled. \u0027They just took out our best player an\u0027 you\u0027re gonna let \u0027em walk away grinning?\u0027\n But the referee was, after all, the former Dean. A man used to head-to-head confrontations with Mustrum Ridcully. He gave Trev a chilly look and turned very deliberately to the Archchancellor and said, \u0027And I trust you, too, captain, will impress upon your team that my decisions are final. There will be a five-minute interlude for you to do this and can some of you fellows take poor Professor Macarona off the field and see if you can find some quack to look at him.\u0027\n A voice behind him bellowed, \u0027You have one right here, sir.\u0027 They turned. A figure slightly larger than life, wearing a top hat and carrying a small bag, nodded at them.\n \u0027Doctor Lawn,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have expected to see you here.\u0027\n \u0027Really?\u0027 said the doctor. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t have missed it for the world. Now some of you men drag him over to that corner and I\u0027ll take a look at him. I\u0027ll send my bill to you, shall I, Mustrum?\u0027\n \u0027Wouldn\u0027t you like to take him somewhere nice and quiet?\u0027 said the referee.\n \u0027No fear! I want to keep my eye on the play.\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re gettin\u0027 away with it,\u0027 said Trev, as he walked back to the line. \u0027Everyone knows they\u0027re gettin\u0027 away with it.\u0027\n \u0027We still have the rest of the team, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt, lacing up his boots. He had, of course, made them himself. They looked like foot gloves. \u0027And me of course, I am the first substitute. I promise that I will do my best, Mister Trev.\u0027\n Thus far, it had been a rather boring afternoon for the Librarian after his one little moment in the sun. It really was rather dull between the goal posts and he was getting hungry and so was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of a large banana in front of the goal. It was later agreed that, in a footballing context, mysteriously appearing fruit should have been greeted with a certain amount of caution. But he was hungry, it was a banana and the metaphysics were sound. He ate it.\n Glenda, up in the stand, wondered if she was the only one to have seen the startlingly yellow fruit in its trajectory and then saw, looking up at her from the crowd, with a big grin on her face, Mrs Atkinson, mother of Tosher, himself something of an unguided weapon. Anyone who had ever been in the Shove knew her as a perpetrator of all kinds of inventive assaults. She had always got away with it because no one in the Shove would hit an old lady, especially one standing next to Tosher.\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Glenda, standing up. \u0027I\u0027ve got to get down there right now.\u0027\n \u0027Not a chance, love,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027It\u0027s shoulder-to-shoulder. A Shove and a half.\u0027\n \u0027Look after Juliet,\u0027 said Glenda. She leaned forward and tapped on the shoulder of the nearest man. \u0027I\u0027ve got to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible. Mind if I jump?\u0027\n He looked past her at the glittering figure of Juliet and said, \u0027Not at all, if you get your girlfriend to give me a big kiss.\u0027\n \u0027No, but I\u0027ll give you one.\u0027\n \u0027Er, don\u0027t trouble yourself, miss, but come on then, give me your hand.\u0027\n It was a reasonably fast descent, as she was passed from hand to hand, accompanied by ribaldry, much genial horseplay and a definite feeling of satisfaction on Glenda\u0027s part that she was wearing her biggest and most impenetrable pants.\n Elbowing and kicking people out of the way, she reached the goal just as the banana was consumed in one gulp and stood panting helplessly in front of the Librarian. He gave her a wide smile, looked thoughtful for a moment and went over backwards.\n High up in the stand, Lady Margolotta turned to Vetinari. \u0027Is that part of the game?\u0027\n \u0027I fear not,\u0027 he said.\n Ladyship yawned. \u0027Well, it relieves the boredom, at least. They\u0027ve spent far more time arguing than playing.\u0027\n Vetinari smiled. \u0027Yes, madam. It does look as if football is very much like diplomacy: short periods of fighting followed by long periods of negotiation.\u0027\n Glenda prodded the Librarian. \u0027Hello? Are you all right?\u0027 All she could hear was a gurgling. She cupped her hands, \u0027Man - er, someone down, here!\u0027\n To another chorus of boos, and, because this was Ankh-Morpork, cheers, the travelling committee, which was what the game had now become, hastened over to the Unseen Academicals\u0027 goal.\n \u0027Someone threw a banana and I saw who did it and I think it\u0027s poisoned,\u0027 said Glenda, all in one breath.\n \u0027He\u0027s breathing very heavily,\u0027 said Ridcully. The comment was unnecessary as the snores were making the goal rattle.\n He crouched down and put his ear to the Librarian\u0027s chest. \u0027I don\u0027t think he\u0027s been poisoned,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Why\u0027s that, Archchancellor?\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Because if anyone has poisoned our Librarian,\u0027 said Ridcully, \u0027then, although I am not, by nature, a vindictive man, I will see to it that this university hunts down the poisoner by every thaumic, mystic and occult means available and makes the rest of their life not only as horrible as they can imagine it, but as horrible as I can imagine it. And you can depend on it, gentlemen, that I have already started work on it.\u0027\n Ponder looked around until he saw Rincewind. \u0027Professor Rincewind. You were, I mean you are, his friend, can\u0027t you stick your fingers down his throat or something?\u0027\n \u0027Well, no,\u0027 said Rincewind. \u0027I am very attached to my fingers and I like to think of them as attached to me.\u0027\n The noise of the crowd was getting louder. They were here to see football, not a debate.\n \u0027But Doctor Lawn is still here,\u0027 Rincewind volunteered. \u0027He makes a living out of sticking his hand in things. He\u0027s got the knack.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, yes,\u0027 said the referee. \u0027Perhaps we can impose upon him to take another patient.\u0027 He turned to Ridcully. \u0027You must play your other substitute.\u0027\n \u0027That would be Trevor Likely,\u0027 said the Archchancellor.\n \u0027No!\u0027 blurted out Trev. \u0027I promised my ol\u0027 mum.\u0027\n \u0027I thought you were part of the team?\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Well, yes, sir, sort of... helpin\u0027 out and all that... I promised my ol\u0027 mum, sir, after Dad died. I know I was down on the list, but who would have thought it would have turned out like this?\u0027\n Ridcully stared at the sky. \u0027Well, it seems to me, gentlemen, that we cannot ask a man to break a promise made to an old mum. That would be a crime more heinous than murder. We will have to play with ten men. It appears that we will have to go without.\u0027\n Up in his ramshackle box, the editor of the Times picked up his notebook and said, \u0027I\u0027m going down there. It\u0027s ridiculous to sit up here like this.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re going on the pitch, sir?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. At least that way I can see what\u0027s happening.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think the referee will allow that, sir!\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re not going to play, Trev?\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027I told you! How many times do I need to tell people? I promised my ol\u0027 mum!\u0027\n \u0027But you are part of the team, Trev.\u0027\n \u0027I promised my ol\u0027 mum!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but I am sure she\u0027d understand.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s easy for you to say. We\u0027ll never know, will we?\u0027\n \u0027Not necessarily,\u0027 said a voice cheerfully.\n \u0027Oh, hello, Doctor Hix,\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t help overhearing your conversation, and if Mister Likely could tell me where his mother is buried, and the referee was to give us a little leeway in regard to time, well it could be possible that I - \u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you put a shovel anywhere near my ol\u0027 mum!\u0027 Trev screamed, tears rolling down his face.\n \u0027I\u0027m sure we all understand, Trev,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027It\u0027s always difficult with old mums,\u0027 and she added, not really thinking what she was saying, \u0027and I think Juliet will understand.\u0027\n She took him by the hand and towed him off the pitch. Trev had been right. It was all going wrong. The buoyant certainties of the beginning of the game were fading.\n \u0027You gave away a goal, sir,\u0027 said Ponder as he and Ridcully lined up for the next encounter.\n \u0027I have great faith in Mister Nutt in goal,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027And I\u0027ll show them what happens to people who try to poison a wizard.\u0027\n The whistle blew.\n \u0027GET DOWN AND GIVE ME TWENTY! I\u0027m sorry, gentlemen, I don\u0027t quite know why I said that... \u0027\n What happens to people who try to poison a wizard, at least in the short run, is that they have an advantage in a game of football. The absence of Professor Macarona was a deadly blow. He had been the pillar around which the university strategy had been built. Emboldened, United went for the kill.\n Even so, the editor of the Times thought, as he lay down at the very edge of the pitch alongside his iconographer, the wizards were just about managing to hold their own. He scribbled as fast as he could, trying hard to ignore the gentle shower of pie wrappings, banana skins, empty greasy pea bags and the occasional beer bottle being tossed on to the pitch. And who is that with the ball now? He glanced at the little crib-sheet of numbers he had managed to jot down. Ah, right. United had broken into the UU side of the field and there was Andy Shank, an unpleasant man by all accounts and... surely that wasn\u0027t a normal footballing procedure. Other players had lined up around him. So he was running in the middle of a group of bodyguards. Even the other team members themselves did not seem to know what was going on, but Mr Shack nevertheless managed a creditable strike at the goal, which was expertly snatched out of the air by... Mister Nutt. He glanced at his crib-sheet, ah yes, the orc, and added in his notebook: \u0027who is clearly adept at grasping big round objects\u0027. But then he felt ashamed and crossed it out. Despite where we are lying, he said to himself, we are not the gutter press.\n The orc.\n Nutt danced back and forth outside his goal, trying to find someone who looked in a position to be able to do something with a ball.\n \u0027Can\u0027t hang around all day, Orc,\u0027 said Andy, staying in front of him. \u0027Got to let it go soon, Orc. Not much help for you now, is there, Orc? They say you\u0027ve got claws. Show us your claws, Orc. That will bust your ball.\u0027\n \u0027I believe that you are a man with unresolved issues, sir.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n Nutt dropkicked the ball over Andy\u0027s head and somewhere in the mob that fought for it there was a crunch, which was followed by a yell, which was followed by the whistle and the whistle was followed by the chant. It began somewhere in the region of Mrs Atkinson, but spread oh so quickly: \u0027Orc! Orc! Orc! Orc! Orc! Orc! Orc!\u0027\n Ridcully got to his feet, standing unsteadily. \u0027The buggers have got me, Henry,\u0027 he yelled, in a voice that could hardly be heard over the chant. \u0027Kneecap! Bloody kneecap!\u0027\n \u0027Who did it?\u0027 the referee demanded.\n \u0027How should I know? It\u0027s a bloody mess, just like the old game! And can\u0027t you get them to stop that bloody chant? That\u0027s not the sort of thing we want to hear.\u0027\n Archchancellor Henry raised his megaphone. \u0027Mister Hoggett?\u0027\n The captain of United pushed his way through the rabble, looking very sheepish.\n \u0027Can\u0027t you control your fans?\u0027\n Hoggett shrugged. \u0027Sorry about that, sir, but what can you do?\u0027\n Henry looked around the Hippo. What could anyone do? It was the mob. The Shove. No one was in charge. It hadn\u0027t an arse to kick, a wrist to be slapped or even an address. It was just there and it was shouting because everybody else was.\n \u0027Well, then can you at least control your team?\u0027 he said. To his surprise Mr Hoggett looked down.\n \u0027Not entirely, sir. Sorry about that, sir, it\u0027s how things are.\u0027\n \u0027One more incident of this kind and I will cancel the match. I suggest you leave the field of play, Mustrum. Who is the substitute captain?\u0027\n \u0027Me!\u0027 said Ridcully, \u0027but under the circumstances I appoint Mister Nobbs as my deputy.\u0027\n \u0027Not Nobby Nobbs?\u0027 exclaimed the former Dean.\n \u0027No relation,\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs very quickly.\n \u0027Well, that was a good choice at least,\u0027 said Trev, sighing. \u0027Nobbsy is a clogger at heart.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s not supposed to be about clogging,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And you know what?\u0027 she added, raising her voice against the steel roar of the crowd. \u0027Whatever the old Dean thinks he can\u0027t stop the game, now. This place would just blow up!\u0027\n \u0027You think so?\u0027 said Trev.\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Yes, I think you\u0027re right. You ought to get out of here.\u0027\n \u0027Me? Not a chance.\u0027\n \u0027But you could make yourself useful and get Juliet out. Get her as far as Vimesy and his lot. I bet they\u0027re waiting right outside the gates. Do it right now while you can still get down the steps. Won\u0027t get a chance once they start to play again.\u0027\n As he left, Glenda walked unheeded down the touchline, to the little area where Dr Lawn was standing guard over his patients.\n \u0027You know that little bag you brought with you, sir?\u0027\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\n \u0027I think you\u0027re going to need a bigger bag. How\u0027s Professor Macarona?\u0027\n The professor was lying on his back, staring at the sky and wearing an expression of bland happiness. \u0027Sorted him out easily enough,\u0027 said the doctor. \u0027He won\u0027t be playing again any time soon. I\u0027ve given him a little something to make him happy. Correction, I have given him a big something to make him happy.\u0027\n \u0027And the Librarian?\u0027\n \u0027Well, I got a couple of lads to help me turn him upside down and he\u0027s been throwing up a lot. He\u0027s still pretty groggy, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s too bad. He\u0027s as sick as a parrot.\u0027\n \u0027This wasn\u0027t how it was supposed to go, you know,\u0027 said Glenda out of a feeling that she should defend the bloody mess.\n \u0027It generally isn\u0027t,\u0027 said the doctor.\n They turned as the noise of the nearby crowd changed. Juliet was coming down the steps glittering. The silence followed her like a lovesick dog. So did Pepe and the reassuring bulk of Madame Sharn, who might be a useful barricade in case the Hippo became a cauldron. Trev, tagging along behind them, seemed like an afterthought in comparison.\n \u0027All right, dear, what\u0027s this all about?\u0027 said Pepe.\n \u0027I ain\u0027t going,\u0027 said Juliet, \u0027not while Trev\u0027s in here. I ain\u0027t leaving without Trev. Pepe says he\u0027s going to win the match.\u0027\n \u0027What have you been saying?\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027He\u0027ll win,\u0027 said Pepe, winking. \u0027He\u0027s got a star in his hand. You want to see him do it, missy?\u0027\n \u0027What are you playin\u0027 at?\u0027 said Trev, angrily.\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027m a bit of a conjurer, me. Or maybe a fairy godmother.\u0027 Pepe gestured around the arena. \u0027See that lot? Their ancestors screamed to see men killing one another and beasts tearing decent folks apart. Men with spears fighting men with nets and all that kind of ugly shite.\u0027\n \u0027And they have cart-tail sales here every other Sunday,\u0027 added Glenda.\n \u0027It\u0027s always been the same,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027It\u0027s one big creature. Never dies. Crying and screaming and loving and hating all down the generations and you can\u0027t tame it and you can\u0027t stop it. Just for you, young lady, and for the soul of Mister Trev, I\u0027m going to throw it a bone. Won\u0027t take a mo\u0027.\u0027\n His slim and slightly spidery form disappeared back up the steps just as the whistle blew. Glenda made out Bledlow Nobbs taking the kick, but Ridcully had made the mistake of thinking that a man who was as big as he was was as clever as he was. And there it was, it was the old game all over again. United were stampeding down the pitch, the old cloggers making way for Andy\u0027s army as they bore down against Nutt. The kick took him in the chest and lifted him into the back of the goal. The whistle blew and was followed by, \u0027DON\u0027T TOUCH THAT, BOYO! YOU DON\u0027T KNOW WHERE IT\u0027S BEEN!\u0027 which was followed by, \u0027I really am very sorry about that, I don\u0027t know why it happens,\u0027 which was followed by... absolute silence.\n Which was broken by one voice, \u0027Likely. Likely. Likely.\u0027 It started up in the stand, somewhere near where Pepe had gone.\n The beast had forgotten the name \u0027Orc\u0027, but certainly remembered the name \u0027Likely\u0027, a name that had fed it so often, a name it had given birth to and eaten, a name that was football, the very heart of the beast. And here, on this broken field, it was a name to conjure with. \u0027LIKELY! LIKELY! LIKELY!\u0027 Hardly a grown man hadn\u0027t seen him. He was the legend. Even after all these years, it was a name that cut through other loyalties. You told your grandchildren about him. You told them how he lay there bleeding and maybe how you dipped your handkerchief in his blood and kept it for a souvenir.\n \u0027Likely,\u0027 intoned the baritone of Madame Sharn.\n \u0027Likely,\u0027 whispered Glenda and then \u0027LIKELY!\u0027 She could see the little figure running along the top of the stands, the chant tailing after it.\n Tears streamed down Trev\u0027s face. Mercilessly, Glenda looked him in the eye. \u0027Likely! Likely!\u0027\n \u0027But my ol\u0027 mum!\u0027 Trev wept.\n Then Juliet leaned over and kissed him and for a moment, the tears were silver. \u0027Likely?\u0027\n Trev stood clutching and unclutching his hands as the chant went on, then he gave a sort of shrug. Then he took his battered tin can out of his jacket pocket and handed it to Glenda, before turning to face the pitch again. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Mum,\u0027 he said, taking off his jacket, \u0027but this is football. And I don\u0027t even have a jersey.\u0027\n \u0027We thought of that,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027When they were being made.\u0027 She pulled one out of the depths of her bag. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-18.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: \n Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) \n The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. \n Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .).
