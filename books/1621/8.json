{"id":94958,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Out of it all Juliet exploded, throwing herself at Glenda and flinging her arms around her neck.\n \u0027She wants me to do it again!\u0027 she panted. \u0027She says I could go to Quirm and Genua, even! She says she\u0027ll pay me more if I don\u0027t work for no one else and the world is an oyster. I never knew that.\u0027\n \u0027But you\u0027ve already got a steady job in the kitchen... \u0027 said Glenda, only three-quarters of her way into consciousness. Later, more often than she liked, she remembered saying those words while the applause thundered all around them.\n There was a gentle pressure on her shoulder, and here was one of the interchangeable young women with a tray. \u0027Madame sends her compliments, miss, and would like to invite you and Miss Juliet to join her in her private boudoir.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s nice of her, but I think we should be getting - A boudoir, you say?\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes. And would you like another drink? It\u0027s a celebration, after all.\u0027\n Glenda looked around at the chattering, laughing and, above all, drinking crowd. The place felt like an oven.\n \u0027All right, but not that sherry, thank you all the same. Have you got something very cold and fizzy?\u0027\n \u0027Why, yes, miss. Lots.\u0027 The girl produced a large bottle and expertly filled a tall fluted glass with, apparently, bubbles. When Glenda drank it, the bubbles filled her, too.\n \u0027Mm, quite nice,\u0027 she ventured. \u0027A bit like lemonade grown up.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s how Madame drinks it, certainly.\u0027\n \u0027Er, this boudoir,\u0027 Glenda tried, following the girl rather unsteadily. \u0027How big is it?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, pretty large, I think. There must be about forty people in there already.\u0027\n \u0027Really? That\u0027s a big boudoir.\u0027 Well, thank goodness, Glenda thought. That at least is sorted out. They really ought to put proper explanations in these novels.\n She had never been sure, given that she had no idea what sort of thing a boudoir was, what sort of thing you would find in it when you did. She found that it contained people, heat and flowers-not flowers in bunches, but in pillars and towering stacks, filling most of the air with clouds of sticky perfume while the people below filled the rest of it with words, tightly packed. No one could possibly hear what they were saying, Glenda told herself, but perhaps that wasn\u0027t important. Perhaps what was important was being there to be seen to say it.\n The crowd parted, and she saw Juliet, still in the glittering outfit, still in the beard... being there. Salamanders were flashing on and off, which meant people with iconographs, didn\u0027t it? The trashy papers were full of people glittering for the picture. She had no time for them. What made it worse was that her disapproval mattered not a fig to anyone. The people glittered anyway. And here was Juliet, glittering most of all.\n \u0027I think I could do with a little fresh air,\u0027 she mumbled.\n Her guide led her gently to an unobtrusive doorway. \u0027Restrooms through here, ma\u0027am.\u0027 And they were�Cexcept that the long, carefully lit room was like some kind of fairy tale, all velvet and drapes. Fifteen surprised visions of Glenda stared at her from as many mirrors. It was overpowering enough to make her sit down in a very expensive bendy-legged chair that turned out to be very restful, too...\n When she jerked awake, she staggered out, got lost in a dark world of smelly passages choked with packing cases and finally blundered into a very large room indeed. It was more like a cavern; at the far end were a pair of double doors, probably ashamed to let in a grey light which did not so much illuminate as accuse. Another chaos of empty clothes racks and packing cases was scattered around the floor. In one place, water had dripped from the roof, and a puddle had formed on the stone, soaking some cardboard.\n \u0027There they are, in there with their glitter and their finery, and it\u0027s all muck and rubbish round the back, right, dear?\u0027 said a voice in the dark. \u0027You look like a lady who can spot a metaphor when she stares it in the face.\u0027\n \u0027Something like that,\u0027 muttered Glenda. \u0027Who\u0027s doing the asking?\u0027\n An orange light glowed and faded in the gloom. Someone was smoking a cigarette in the shadows.\n \u0027It\u0027s the same all over, love. If there was an award for the arse end of things, there\u0027d be a real bloody squabble for first place. I\u0027ve seen a few palaces in my time and they\u0027re all the same: turrets and banners in the front, maids\u0027 bedrooms and water pipes round the back. Fancy a top-up? Can\u0027t be walking around here with an empty glass, you\u0027ll stand out.\u0027\n The cooler air was making her feel better. She still had a glass in her hand. \u0027What is this stuff?\u0027\n \u0027Well, if this was any other party it\u0027d probably be the cheapest fizzing wine you could strain through a sock, but Madame won\u0027t stint. It\u0027s the real stuff. Champagne.\u0027\n \u0027What? I thought only nobby people drank that!\u0027\n \u0027No, just people with money, love. Sometimes it\u0027s the same thing.\u0027\n She looked closer, and gasped. \u0027What? Are you Pepe?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s me, love.\u0027\n \u0027But you\u0027re not all... all... \u0027 She waved her hands frantically.\n \u0027Off duty, love. Don\u0027t have to worry about... \u0027 He waved his hands equally frantically. \u0027I\u0027ve got a bottle here of our very own. Care to join me?\u0027\n \u0027Well, I ought to be getting back in there - \u0027\n \u0027Why? To fuss around her like an old hen? Leave her be, love. She\u0027s a duck who\u0027s just found water.\u0027\n Pepe looked taller in this gloom. Maybe it was the language and the lack of flapping. And, of course, anyone next to Madame Sharn would look small. He was willowy, though, like someone made of sinews.\n \u0027But anything could happen to her!\u0027\n Pepe\u0027s grin gleamed. \u0027Yes! But probably won\u0027t. My word, she sold micromail for us, and no mistake. Told Madame I had a good feeling. She\u0027s got a great career in front of her.\u0027\n \u0027No, she\u0027s got a good, steady job in the Night Kitchen, with me,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027It might not be big money, but it\u0027ll turn up every week. On the nail, and she won\u0027t lose it if someone prettier comes along.\u0027\n \u0027Dolly Sisters, right? Sounds like the Botney Street area,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027I\u0027m sure of it. Not too bad, as I recall. I didn\u0027t get beaten up much down there, but at the end of the day they\u0027re all crab buckets.\u0027\n Glenda was taken aback. She\u0027d expected anger or condescension, not this sharp little grin.\n \u0027You know a lot about our city for a dwarf from Uberwald, I must say.\u0027\n \u0027No, love, I know a lot about Uberwald for a boy from Lobbin Clout,\u0027 said Pepe smoothly. \u0027Old Cheese Alley, to be precise. Local lad, me. Wasn\u0027t always a dwarf, you know. I just joined.\u0027\n \u0027What? Can you do that?\u0027\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s not like they advertised. But yeah, if you know the right people. And Madame knew the right people, ha, knew quite a lot about the right people. It wasn\u0027t hard. I\u0027ve got to believe in a few things, there\u0027s a few observances, and of course I have to keep off the old booze - \u0027 He smiled as her glance pinned the glass in his hand, and went on: \u0027Too quick, love, I was going to add \"when I\u0027m working\", and good job too. It doesn\u0027t matter if you are shoring up the mine roof or riveting a bodice, being a piss artist is bloody stupid. And the moral of all this is, you have to grab life or drop back into the crab bucket.\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes, that\u0027s all very well to say,\u0027 Glenda snapped, wondering what crabs had got to do with anything. \u0027But in real life people have responsibilities. We don\u0027t have shiny jobs with lots of money, but they are real jobs doing things that people need! I\u0027d be ashamed of myself, selling boots at four hundred dollars a go, which only rich people can afford. What\u0027s the point of that?\u0027\n \u0027Well, you must admit that it makes rich people less rich,\u0027 said the chocolate voice of Madame behind her. Like many large people, she could move as quietly as the balloon she resembled. \u0027That\u0027s a good start, isn\u0027t it? And it goes to wages for the miners and the smiths. It all goes around, they tell me.\u0027\n She sat down heavily on a packing case, glass in hand. \u0027Well, we\u0027ve got most of them out now,\u0027 she said, fumbling in her capacious breastplate with her spare hand and pulling out a thick wad of paper.\n \u0027The big names want to be in on this and everyone wants it exclusively and we\u0027re going to need another forge. Tomorrow I\u0027ll go and see the bank.\u0027 She paused to dip into her metal bodice again. \u0027As a dwarf I was raised in the faith that gold is the one true currency,\u0027 she said, counting out some crisp notes, \u0027but I have to admit this stuff is a lot warmer. That\u0027s fifty dollars for Juliet, twenty-five from me and twenty-five from the champagne, which is feeling happy. Juliet said to give it to you to look after.\u0027\n \u0027Miss Glenda thinks that we\u0027ll lead her treasure into a lifetime of worthless sin and depravity,\u0027 said Pepe.\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s a thought,\u0027 said Madame, \u0027but I can\u0027t remember when I last had some depravity.\u0027\n \u0027Tuesday,\u0027 said Pepe.\n \u0027A whole box of chocolates is not depraved. Besides, you slid out the card between the layers, which confused me. I did not intend to eat the bottom layer. I did not want the bottom layer. It was practically assault.\u0027\n Pepe coughed. \u0027We\u0027re scaring the normal lady, love.\u0027\n Madame smiled. \u0027Glenda, I know what you\u0027re thinking. You\u0027re thinking we\u0027re a couple of louche evil clowns who booze away in a world of smoke and mirrors. Well, that\u0027s fairly accurate right now, but today was the end of a year\u0027s hard work, you see.\u0027\n And you bicker like an old married couple, Glenda thought. Her head was aching. She\u0027d tried a rat fruit, that was the trouble, she was sure of it.\n \u0027In the morning I\u0027m going to show these orders to the manager of the Royal Bank and ask him for a lot of money. If he trusts us, can you? We need Juliet. She just... sparkles.\u0027\n And you two are holding hands. Tightly. Something soft snapped inside Glenda.\n \u0027All right, look,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s like this. Jools is going to come back home with me tonight, to get her head straight. Tomorrow... well, we\u0027ll see.\u0027\n \u0027We can\u0027t ask for more than that. Can we?\u0027 said Madame, patting Glenda on the knee. \u0027You know, Juliet thinks the world of you. She said she\u0027d need you to say yes. She was telling all the society ladies about your pies.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s been talking to society ladies?\u0027 said Glenda in astonishment laced with trepidation and tinted with wonder.\n \u0027Certainly. They all wanted a close look at the micromail, and she just chatted away, cheery as you like. I don\u0027t think anyone ever said \"Wotcher!\" to them in their lives before.\u0027\n \u0027Oh no! I\u0027m sorry!\u0027\n \u0027Why be? They were rather taken by it. And apparently you can bake pickled onions into a pie so that they stay crunchy?\u0027\n \u0027She told them that?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes. I gather that they all intend to get their cooks to try it out.\u0027\n \u0027Hah. They\u0027ll never find the way!\u0027 said Glenda with satisfaction.\n \u0027So Jools says.\u0027\n \u0027We... generally call her Juliet,\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027She told us to call her Jools,\u0027 said Madame. \u0027Is there a problem?\u0027\n \u0027Well, er, not really a problem,\u0027 Glenda began wretchedly.\n \u0027That\u0027s good, then,\u0027 said Madame, who clearly knew when not to notice subtleties. \u0027Now let\u0027s prise her away from her new friends, and you can see to it that she gets a good night\u0027s sleep.\u0027\n There was laughter, and the girls helping with the show streamed out into the clammy place that was the midwife to beauty. Juliet was among them, and with the loudest laugh. She broke away when she saw Glenda and gave her another hug. \u0027Oh, Glendy, isn\u0027t this great? It\u0027s like a fairy story!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, well, it might be,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027but they don\u0027t all have happy endings. Just you remember you have a good job now, with prospects and regular leftovers to take home. That\u0027s not to be lightly thrown away.\u0027\n \u0027No, it should be hurled with great force,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027I mean, what is this? Emberella? The wand has been waved, the court is cheering, a score of handsome princes are waiting to sign up for just a sniff of her slipper, and you want her to go back to work making pumpkins?\u0027\n He looked at their blank faces. \u0027All right, perhaps that came out a little confused, but surely you can follow the seam? This is a big chance! As big as it gets. A way out of the bucket!\u0027\n \u0027I think we\u0027ll go home now,\u0027 said Glenda primly. \u0027Come along, Jools.\u0027\n \u0027See,\u0027 said Pepe, when they had gone, \u0027it\u0027s a crab bucket.\u0027\n Madame peered into a bottle to see if, against all probability, one glassful yet remained. \u0027Did you know she more or less raised the kid? Jools will do what she says.\u0027\n \u0027What a waste,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Don\u0027t take the world by storm, stay here and make pies? You think that\u0027s a life?\u0027\n \u0027Someone has to make pies,\u0027 Madame said, with an infuriating calm reasonableness.\n \u0027Oh, pur-lease! Not her. Let it not be her. And for leftovers? Oh no!\u0027\n Madame picked up another empty bottle. She knew it was empty because it was in the vicinity of Pepe at the end of a long day, but she examined it anyway because thirst springs eternal.\n \u0027Hmm. It might not come to that,\u0027 she said. \u0027I have a feeling that Miss Glenda is just about to start thinking. There\u0027s a powerful mind behind that rather sad cloak and those awful shoes. Today might be its lucky day.\u0027\n Ridcully strode through the corridors of Unseen University with his robes flapping confidently behind him. He had a big stride and Ponder had to run in a semi-crabwise fashion to keep up with him, his clipboard clutched protectively to his chest. \u0027You know we did agree that it wasn\u0027t to be used for purposes other than pure research, Archchancellor. You actually signed the edict.\u0027\n \u0027Did I? I don\u0027t remember that, Stibbons.\u0027\n \u0027I remember it most distinctly, sir. It was just after the case of Mister Floribunda.\u0027\n \u0027Which one was he?\u0027 said Ridcully, still striding purposefully ahead.\n \u0027He was the one who felt a little peckish and asked the Cabinet for a bacon sandwich to see what would happen.\u0027\n \u0027I thought that anything taken out of the Cabinet had to be returned in 14.14 hours recurring?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir. That is the case, but the Cabinet appears to have strange rules that we do not fully understand. In any case, Mister Floribunda\u0027s defence was that he thought the fourteen-hour rule didn\u0027t apply to bacon sandwiches. Nor did he tell anybody and so the students on his floor were only alerted when they heard the screams some fourteen hours later.\u0027\n \u0027Correct me if I\u0027m wrong,\u0027 said Ridcully, still covering the flagstones at an impressive rate, \u0027but would it not have been digested by that point?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir. But it still went back to the Cabinet, of its own accord, you might say. That was quite an interesting discovery. We did not know that could happen.\u0027\n Ridcully stopped and Ponder bumped into him. \u0027What exactly did happen to him?\u0027\n \u0027You wouldn\u0027t want me to draw a picture, sir. However, the good news is that he will soon be out of the wheelchair. In fact, I gather he\u0027s already walking quite well with a stick. How we discipline him is, of course, up to you, sir. The file is on your desk, as are, indeed, a considerable number of other documents.\u0027\n Ridcully strode off again. \u0027He did it to see what would happen, did he?\u0027 he said cheerfully.\n \u0027So he said, sir,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027And this was against my express orders, was it?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, absolutely definitely, sir,\u0027 said Ponder, who knew his Archchancellor and already had an inkling of how this one was going to end. \u0027And so therefore, sir, I must insist that he - \u0027 He walked into Ridcully again because the man had stopped outside a large door on which was a bright red notice saying, \u0027No Item To Be Removed From This Room Without The Express Permission Of The Archchancellor. Signed Ponder Stibbons pp Mustrum Ridcully.\u0027\n \u0027You signed this one for me?\u0027 Ridcully said.\n \u0027Yes, sir. You were busy at the time and we had agreed on this one.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, of course, but I don\u0027t think that you should pp just like that. Remember what that young lady said about the UU.\u0027\n Ponder produced a large key and opened the door. \u0027May I also remind you, Archchancellor, that we agreed a moratorium on the use of the Cabinet of Curiosity until we had cleaned up some of the residual magic in the building. We still don\u0027t seem to have got rid of the squid.\u0027\n \u0027Did we agree, Mister Stibbons,\u0027 said Ridcully, turning around sharply, \u0027or did you agree with yourself pp me, as it were?\u0027\n \u0027Well, er, I think I understood the spirit of your thinking, sir.\u0027\n \u0027Well, this is the spirit of pure research,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027It\u0027s research into how we can hope to save our cheeseboard. Many would say there could be no greater goal. As for young Floribunda... \u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir?\u0027 said Ponder wearily.\n \u0027Promote him. Whatever level he is, move him up one.\u0027\n \u0027I think that\u0027ll send the wrong kind of signal,\u0027 Ponder tried.\n \u0027On the contrary, Mister Stibbons. It will send exactly the right message to the student body.\u0027\n \u0027But he disobeyed an express order, may I point out?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. He showed independent thinking and a certain amount of pluck, and in the course of so doing added valuable data to our understanding of the Cabinet.\u0027\n \u0027But he might have destroyed the whole university, sir.\u0027\n \u0027Right, in which case he would have been vigorously disciplined, if we\u0027d been able to find anything left of him. But he didn\u0027t and he was lucky and we need lucky wizards. Promote him, on the direct order of me, not pp\u0027d at all. Incidentally, how loud were his screams?\u0027\n \u0027As a matter of fact, Archchancellor, the first one was so heartfelt that it kept going long after he\u0027d run out of breath and apparently adopted an independent existence. Residual magic again. We\u0027ve had to lock it in one of the cellars.\u0027\n \u0027Did he actually say what the bacon sandwich was like?\u0027\n \u0027Coming or leaving, sir?\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Only coming, I think,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027I do have a vivid imagination after all.\u0027\n \u0027He said it was the most delightful bacon sandwich he\u0027d ever eaten. It was the bacon sandwich that you dream of when you hear the words bacon sandwich and never, ever quite get.\u0027\n \u0027With brown sauce?\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Of course. Apparently, it was the bacon sandwich to end all bacon sandwiches.\u0027\n \u0027It nearly did, for him, but isn\u0027t that what you already know about the Cabinet? That it always delivers a perfect specimen?\u0027\n \u0027Actually, we know very little for certain,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027What we do know is that it will hold nothing too large to fit inside a cube measuring 14.14 inches recurring on a side, that it will cease working if, we now know, a non-organic object is not replaced in it in 14.14 hours recurring, and that none of its contents are pink, although we do not know why this should be.\u0027\n \u0027But bacon is definitely organic, Mister Stibbons,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n Ponder sighed. \u0027Yes, sir, we don\u0027t know why that is either.\u0027\n The Archchancellor took pity on him. \u0027Perhaps it was one of those very crispy ones,\u0027 he suggested kindly. \u0027The kind that you can break between your fingers. I like that in a bacon sandwich.\u0027\n The door swung open and there it was. Small, in the centre of a very large room...\n The Cabinet of Curiosity.\n \u0027Do you think this is wise?\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Of course not,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Now find me a football.\u0027\n On one wall was a white mask, such as one might wear to a carnival. Ponder turned towards it. \u0027Hex. Please find me a ball suitable for the game of football.\u0027\n \u0027That mask is new?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027I thought Hex\u0027s voice travelled in blit space?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir. It just comes out of the air, sir. But somehow, well, it feels better to have something to talk to.\u0027\n \u0027What shape football do you require?\u0027 said Hex, his voice as smooth as clarified butter. \u0027Oval or spherical?\u0027\n \u0027Spherical,\u0027 said Ponder.\n Instantly the Cabinet shook.\n The thing had always worried Ridcully. It looked too smug, for a start. It seemed to be saying: You don\u0027t know what you are doing. You use me as a kind of lucky dip and I bet you have never thought of how many dangerous things can fit into a fourteen-inch cube. In fact, Ridcully had thought about that, often at three in the morning, and never went into the room without a couple of sub-critical spells in his pocket just in case. And then there was Nutt... Well, hope for the best and prepare for the worst, that was the UU way.\n A drawer slid out and went on sliding until it reached the wall and presumably continued to slide into some other hospitable set of dimensions, because it never turned up outside the room, no matter how often you looked.\n \u0027Very smooth today,\u0027 he observed, as another drawer rose up from under the floor and sprouted a further drawer exactly the same size as itself which began to move purposefully towards the far wall.\n \u0027Yes. The lads at Brazeneck have come up with a new algorithm for handling wave spaces in higher-level blit. It speeds up something like the Cabinet by getting on for 2,000 Drinkies.\u0027\n Ridcully frowned. \u0027Did you just make that up?\u0027\n \u0027No, sir. Charlie Drinkie came up with it at Brazeneck. It\u0027s a shorter way of saying 15,000 iterations to the first negative blit. And it\u0027s a lot easier to remember.\u0027\n \u0027So people you know at Brazeneck send you stuff?\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027For free?\u0027\n \u0027Of course, sir,\u0027 said Ponder, looking surprised. \u0027The free sharing of information is central to the pursuit of natural philosophy.\u0027\n \u0027And so you tell them things, do you?\u0027\n Ponder sighed. \u0027Yes, of course.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think I approve of that,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027I\u0027m all for the free sharing of information, provided it\u0027s them sharing their information with us.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir, but I think we\u0027re rather hampered by the meaning of the word \"sharing\".\u0027\n \u0027Nevertheless,\u0027 Ridcully began and stopped. A sound so quiet that they had barely noticed it had stopped. The Cabinet of Curiosity had folded itself up and was once again just a piece of wooden furniture in the centre of the room, but as they looked at it its two front doors opened and a brown ball dropped on to the floor and bounced with a sound like gloing! Ridcully marched over and picked it up, turning it in his hands.\n \u0027Interesting,\u0027 he said, slamming it towards the floor. It bounced up past his head, but he was quick enough to catch it on the way down. \u0027Remarkable,\u0027 he said. \u0027What do you think of this, Stibbons?\u0027 He flicked the ball into the air and kicked it hard across the room. It came back towards Ponder, who, to his own amazement, caught it.\n \u0027Seems to have a life of its own.\u0027 Ponder dropped it on to the floor and tried a kick.\n It flew.\n Ponder Stibbons was the quintessential, all-time holder of the one-hundred-metre note from his auntie, which also asked for him to be excused all sporting activities on account of his athlete\u0027s ear, erratic stigmatism, a grumbling nose and a revolving spleen. By his own admission, he would rather run ten miles, leap a five-bar gate and climb a big hill than engage in any athletic activity.\n The ball sang to him. It sang gloing!\n A few minutes later, he and Ridcully walked back to the Great Hall, occasionally bouncing the ball on the flagstones. There was something about the sound of gloing! that made you want to hear it again.\n \u0027You know, Ponder, I think you\u0027ve been doing it all wrong. There are more things in Heaven and Disc than are dreamed of in our philosophies.\u0027\n \u0027I expect so, sir. I don\u0027t have many things in my philosophies.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s all about the ball,\u0027 said Ridcully, slamming it down hard on the flagstones again and catching it. \u0027Tomorrow, we\u0027ll bring it here and see what happens. You gave the ball a mighty kick, Mister Stibbons, and yet you are, by your own admission, a wet and a weed.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir, and a wuss, and I am proud of the appellation. I\u0027d better remind you, Archchancellor, that the thing mustn\u0027t spend too long outside the Cabinet.\u0027\n Gloing!\n \u0027But we could make a copy, couldn\u0027t we?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027It\u0027s only leather stitched together, probably protecting a bladder of some sort. I bet any decent craftsman could make another one for us.\u0027\n \u0027What, now?\u0027\n \u0027The lights never go off on the Street of Cunning Artificers.\u0027\n By now, they were back in the Great Hall and Ridcully looked around until his gaze lighted on two figures pushing a trolley laden with candles. \u0027You lads, to me!\u0027 he shouted. They stopped pushing the trolley and walked over to him. \u0027Mister Stibbons here would like you to run an errand for him. It\u0027s of considerable importance. Who are you?\u0027\n \u0027Trevor Likely, guv.\u0027\n \u0027Nutt, Archchancellor.\u0027\n Ridcully\u0027s eyes narrowed. \u0027Yes... Nutt,\u0027 he said, and thought about the spells in his pocket. \u0027The candle dribbler, yes? Well, you can make yourselves useful. Over to you, Mister Stibbons.\u0027\n Ponder Stibbons held out the ball. \u0027Have you any idea what this is?\u0027\n Nutt took it out of his hands and bounced it on the tiles a couple of times.\n Gloing! Gloing!\n \u0027Yes. It appears to be a simple sphere, although technically I believe it to be, in actual fact, a truncated icosahedron, made by stitching together a number of pentagons and hexagons of tough leather, and stitching means holes and holes let the air leak... Ah, there is lacing just here, you see? There must be some internal bladder�Canimal, probably. A balloon, as it were, for lightness and elasticity, encapsulated by leather, simple and elegant.\u0027 He handed the ball back to Ponder, who was open-mouthed.\n \u0027Do you know everything, Mister Nutt?\u0027 he said with the sarcasm of a born pedagogue.\n Nutt\u0027s reply was concentrated and there was a lengthy pause before he said, \u0027I\u0027m not sure about a lot of the detail, sir.\u0027\n Ponder heard a snigger behind him and felt himself redden. He\u0027d been cheeked, by a dribbler, even if Nutt was the most incontinently erudite one he\u0027d ever encountered.\n \u0027Do you know where a copy of this may be made?\u0027 said Ridcully loudly.\n \u0027I expect so,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I believe dwarf rubber will be our friend here.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s plenty of dwarfs up at Old Cobblers who could knock one up, guv,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027They\u0027re good at this sort of thing, but they\u0027d want paying, they always want paying. Nuffin\u0027s on credit when you\u0027re dealing with a dwarf.\u0027\n \u0027Give these young gentlemen twenty-five dollars, Mister Stibbons, will you?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s a lot of money, Archchancellor.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, well, dwarfs, while the salt of the earth, don\u0027t have much of a grasp of small numbers and I want this in a hurry. I\u0027m sure I can trust Mister Likely and Mister Nutt with the money, can\u0027t I?\u0027 He said it jovially, but there was an edge to his voice. Trev, at least, got the message very quickly; a wizard could trust you because of the hellish future he could unleash on you if his trust was betrayed.\n \u0027You can certainly trust us, guv.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I thought I could,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n When they had gone, Ponder Stibbons said, \u0027You\u0027re entrusting them with twenty-five dollars?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, indeed,\u0027 said Ridcully cheerfully. \u0027It will be interesting to see the outcome.\u0027\n \u0027Nevertheless, sir, I have to say that it was an unwise move.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you for your input, Mister Stibbons, but may I gently remind you who is the guv around here?\u0027\n Glenda and Juliet took a trolley bus home, another huge extravagance but, of course, Glenda was carrying more money than she had ever seen at one go. She had stuffed the notes into her bodice, �� la Madame, and it seemed to generate a heat of its own. You were safe on a troll. Anyone wanting to mug a troll would have to use a building on a stick.\n Juliet was quiet. This puzzled Glenda; she had expected her to bubble like a fountain full of soap flakes. The silence was unnerving.\n \u0027Look. I know it was a lot of fun,\u0027 Glenda said, \u0027but showing off clothes isn\u0027t like a real job, is it?\u0027 No. Real jobs pay a lot less, she thought.\n Where had that come from? Jools hadn\u0027t opened her mouth and the troll was still covered in mountain lichen and had a single-syllable vocabulary. It came from me, she thought. This is about dreams, isn\u0027t it? She is a dream. I dare say the micromail is good stuff, but she made it sparkle. And what can I say? You help in the kitchen. You are useful and helpful, at least when you\u0027re not daydreaming, but you don\u0027t know how to keep accounts or plan a weekly menu. What would you do without me? How would you get on away from here, in foreign parts where folks are so odd?\n \u0027I\u0027ll have to open a bank account for you,\u0027 she said aloud. \u0027It\u0027ll be our little secret, all right? It\u0027ll be a nice little nest egg for you.\u0027\n \u0027And if Dad don\u0027t know I\u0027ve got the money he won\u0027t get it off me and piss it against the wall,\u0027 said Juliet, glancing up at the solemn, impassive face of the troll. If Glenda had known how to say \u0027Pas devant le troll\u0027 she would have done so. But it was true: Mr Stollop commanded that all family earnings were pooled, with him holding the pool, which was then pooled with his friends in the bar of the Turkey \u0026 Vegetables, and ultimately pooled again in the reeking alley behind it.\n She settled for: \u0027I wouldn\u0027t put it quite like that.\u0027\n Gloing! Gloing!\n The new ball was magic, that\u0027s what it was. It bounced back to Trev\u0027s waiting hand as if by its own free will. For two pins he\u0027d risk kicking it, but he and Nutt and the ball were already picking up a trail of curious street urchins such that he would be guaranteed never to see it again.\n \u0027Are you really sure you know \u0027ow it works?\u0027 he said to Nutt.\n \u0027Oh, yes, Mister Trev. It\u0027s a lot simpler than it looks, although the polyhedrons will need some work, but overall - \u0027\n A hand landed on Trev\u0027s shoulder. \u0027Well, now. Trev Likely,\u0027 said Andy. \u0027And his little pet, harder to kill than a cockroach, by all accounts. Something\u0027s going on, ain\u0027t it, Trev? And you\u0027re going to tell me what it is. Here, what\u0027s that you\u0027re holding?\u0027\n \u0027Not today, Andy,\u0027 said Trev, backing away. \u0027You\u0027re lucky you didn\u0027t end up in the Tanty with Mister One Drop measurin\u0027 you up for a hemp collar.\u0027\n \u0027Me?\u0027 said Andy innocently. \u0027I didn\u0027t do a thing! Can\u0027t blame me for what a thicko Stollop does, but something is going on with the football, ain\u0027t it? Vetinari wants to muck it about.\u0027\n \u0027Just leave it alone, will you?\u0027 said Trev.\n There was more than the usual gang behind Andy. The Stollop brothers had sensibly spared the streets their presence lately, but people like Andy could always find followers. Like they said, it was better to be beside Andy than in front of him. And with Andy you never knew just when he was -\n The cutlass was out in one movement. That was Andy. Whatever it was inside that held back the primeval rage could flick off just like that. And here came the blade with Trev\u0027s future written on it in very short words. And it stopped in mid air and Nutt\u0027s voice said, \u0027I believe I could squeeze with enough pressure, Andy, to make your bones grind and flow. There are twenty-seven bones in the human hand. I truly believe that I could make every one of them useless with the slightest extra pressure. However, I would like to give you a chance to revise your current intentions.\u0027\n Andy\u0027s face was a mix of colours: a white that was almost blue and a rage that was almost crimson. He was trying to pull away and Nutt stood calmly and was completely immoveable. \u0027Get \u0027im!\u0027 Andy hissed at the world in general.\n \u0027Could I regretfully remind you gentlemen that I have another hand?\u0027 said Nutt.\n He must have squeezed because Andy yelped as his hand ground against the weapon\u0027s handle.\n Trev knew all too well that Andy did not have friends, he had followers. They were looking at their stricken leader and they were looking at Nutt, and they could see very clearly not only that Nutt had a spare hand, but what he was capable of doing with it. They did not move.\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Perhaps this has been nothing more than an unfortunate misunderstanding. I am about to release my grip just enough for you to drop the cutlass, Mister Andy, please.\u0027\n There was another intake of breath from Andy as the cutlass landed on the stones.\n \u0027Now, if you would excuse us, Mister Trev and I are going to walk away.\u0027\n \u0027Take the bloody cutlass! Don\u0027t leave the cutlass on the ground,\u0027 said Trev.\n \u0027I am sure Mister Andy would not come after us,\u0027 said Nutt.\n \u0027Are you bloody mad?\u0027 said Trev. He reached down, snatched up the cutlass and said, \u0027Let \u0027im go and let\u0027s get a move on.\u0027\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Nutt. He must have squeezed a little harder because now Andy slumped to his knees.\n Trev pulled Nutt away and towed him through the permanent city crowd. \u0027That\u0027s Andy!\u0027 he said, hurrying them along. \u0027You don\u0027t expect logic with Andy. You don\u0027t expect him to \"learn the error of his ways\". Don\u0027t look for any sense when Andy\u0027s after you. Got that? Don\u0027t try talkin\u0027 to \u0027im as if \u0027e\u0027s a human being. Now, keep up with me.\u0027\n Dwarf shops were doing well these days, largely because they understood the first rule of merchandising, which is this: I have got goods for sale and the customer has got money. I should have the money and, regrettably, that involves the customer having my goods. To this end, therefore, I will not say \u0027The one in the window is the last one we have, and we can\u0027t sell it to you, because if we did no one would know we have them for sale\u0027, or \u0027We\u0027ll probably have some more on Wednesday\u0027, or \u0027We just can\u0027t keep them on the shelves\u0027, or \u0027I\u0027m fed up with telling people there\u0027s no demand for them\u0027 I will make a sale by any means short of physical violence, because without one I am a waste of space.\n Glang Snorrisson lived by this rule, but he didn\u0027t like people much, an affliction that affects many who have to deal with the general public over a long period, and the two people on the other side of his counter were making him edgy. One was small and looked harmless, but something so deep down in Glang\u0027s psyche that it was probably stuffed in his genes was making him nervous. The other intru - customer was not much more than a boy and therefore likely to commit a crime any moment.\n Glang dealt with the situation by not understanding anything they said and uttering silly insults in his native tongue. There was hardly a risk. Only the Watch learned Dwarfish, and it came as a surprise when the worryingly harmless one said, in better Llamedos Dwarfish than Glang himself spoke these days: \u0027Such incivility to the amiable stranger shames your beard and erases the writings of Tak, ancient merchant.\u0027\n \u0027What did you say to him?\u0027 Trev asked, as Glang spluttered out apologies.\n \u0027Oh, just a traditional greeting,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Could you pass me the ball, please?\u0027 He took the football and bounced it on the floor.\n Gloing!\n \u0027I suspect you might know the trick of making brimstoned rubber?\u0027\n \u0027That was my... my grandfather\u0027s name,\u0027 Glang stuttered.\n \u0027Ah, a good omen,\u0027 said Trev quickly. He caught the ball and batted it down again.\n Gloing!\n \u0027I can cut out and stitch the outer cover if you will work on the bladder,\u0027 said Nutt, \u0027and we will pay you fifteen dollars and allow you a licence to make as many more as you wish.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll make a fortune,\u0027 said Trev encouragingly.\n Gloing! Gloing! went the ball, and Trev added, \u0027That\u0027d be a university licence, too. No one would dare mess with it.\u0027\n \u0027How come you know about brimstoned rubber?\u0027 said Glang. He had the look about him of someone who knows that he is outnumbered but will go down fighting.\n \u0027Because King Rhys of the dwarfs presented a dress of brimstoned rubber and leather to Lady Margolotta six months ago, and I\u0027m pretty sure I understand the principle.\u0027\n \u0027Her? The Dark Lady? She can kill people with a thought!\u0027\n \u0027She is my friend,\u0027 said Nutt calmly, \u0027and I will help you.\u0027\n Glenda wasn\u0027t quite sure why she tipped the troll tuppence. He was elderly and slow, but his upholstery was well kept and he had twin umbrellas and it was no fun for trolls to come this far, because the kid gangs would have graffitied them to the waist by the time they got out of there.\n She felt hidden eyes on her as she walked up to her door, and it didn\u0027t matter.\n \u0027All right,\u0027 she said to Juliet. \u0027Have a night off, okay?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll go back to work with you,\u0027 said Juliet, to her surprise. \u0027We need the money and I can\u0027t tell Dad about the fifty dollars, can I?\u0027\n There was a small collision of expectations in Glenda\u0027s head as Juliet went on: \u0027You\u0027re right, it\u0027s a steady job and I want to keep it an\u0027 I\u0027m so fick I\u0027d prob\u0027ly muck up the other one. I mean, it was fun and all that, but then, I thought, well, you always gave me good advice, an\u0027 I remembered that time you kicked Greasy Damien in the goolies so hard when he was messin\u0027 me around, he walked bent double for a week. Besides, if I go away with them it means leaving the street, and Dad and the lads. That\u0027s really scary. An\u0027 you said be careful about fairy stories, and you\u0027re right, half the time it\u0027s goblins. An\u0027 I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d get on without you puttin\u0027 me right. You are solid, you are. I can\u0027t remember you not bein\u0027 around, and when one of the girls sniggered about your old coat I told her you work very hard.\u0027\n Glenda thought, I used to be able to read you like a book�Cone with big colourful pages and not many words. And now I can\u0027t. What\u0027s happening? You\u0027re agreeing with me and I ought to feel smug about it, but I don\u0027t. I feel bad about it, and I don\u0027t know why, and that hurts.\n \u0027Maybe you ought to sleep on it,\u0027 she suggested.\n \u0027No, I\u0027d mess it up, I know I would.\u0027\n \u0027Do you feel all right?\u0027 Something inside Glenda was shouting at her.\n \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027Oh, it was fun and that, but it\u0027s for nobby girls, not me. It\u0027s all glitter, nuffin\u0027 you can hold. But a pie\u0027s a pie, right? Solid! Besides, who\u0027d look after Dad and the lads?\u0027\n No, no, no, screamed Glenda\u0027s voice in her own head, not that! I didn\u0027t want that. Oh, didn\u0027t I? Then what did I think I was doing, passing on all that old toot? She looks to me, and I\u0027ve gone and given her a good example! Why? Because I wanted to protect her. She\u0027s so... vulnerable. Oh dear, I\u0027ve taught her to be me, and I\u0027ve even made a bad mess of that chore!\n \u0027All right, then, you can head back with me.\u0027\n \u0027Will we see the banquet? Our dad has been fretting about the banquet. He reckons Lord Vetinari is going to have everyone murdered.\u0027\n \u0027Does he do that a lot?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but it gets hushed up, our dad says.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s going to be hundreds of people there. That would need a lot of hush.\u0027 And if I don\u0027t like what I hear, there won\u0027t be enough hush in all the world, she thought.\n Trev mooched aimlessly around the shop while Nutt and the dwarf put their heads together over the ball. For some reason there was a faint scrabbling on the roof. It sounded like claws. Just a bird, he told himself. Even Andy wouldn\u0027t come in through the roof. There was another pressing matter. This place would have a privy, wouldn\u0027t it? There was at least a back door and that would inevitably lead to a back alley and, well, what is a back alley for except for sleeping tramps and the call of nature? Possibly in the same place if you were feeling cruel. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-8.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: \n Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) \n The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. \n Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .).
