{"id":94957,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Automatically, Ridcully turned again to look at Glenda, and got a distinct feeling that here was a woman about to learn a foreign language in a hurry. It was an odd but slightly exciting idea. Until this moment, he had never thought of the maids in the singular. They were all... servants. He was polite to them, and smiled when appropriate. He assumed they sometimes did other things than fetch and carry, and sometimes went off to get married and sometimes just... went off. Up until now, though, he\u0027d never really thought that they might think, let alone what they thought about, and least of all what they thought about the wizards. He turned back to the table.\n \u0027Who will be doing the chanting, Mister Stibbons?\u0027\n \u0027The aforesaid supporters, fans, sir. It\u0027s short for fanatics.\u0027\n \u0027And ours will be... who?\u0027\n \u0027Well, we are the largest employer in the city, sir.\u0027\n \u0027As a matter of fact I think Vetinari is, and I wish to all hells I knew exactly who he is employing,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027I\u0027m sure our loyal staff will support us,\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes. He turned to Glenda, and to Ridcully\u0027s dismay said, glutinously, \u0027I\u0027m sure you would be a fan, would you not, my child?\u0027\n The Archchancellor sat back. He had a definite feeling that this was going to be fun. Well, she hadn\u0027t blushed and she hadn\u0027t yelled. In fact, she had not done anything, apart from carefully pick up the china.\n \u0027I support Dolly Sisters, sir. Always have done.\u0027\n \u0027And are they any good?\u0027\n \u0027Having a poor patch at the moment, sir.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, then I expect you will want to support our team, which will be very good indeed!\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t do that, sir. You\u0027ve got to support your team, sir.\u0027\n \u0027But you just said they weren\u0027t doing well.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s when you support your team, sir. Otherwise you\u0027re a numper.\u0027\n \u0027A numper being... ?\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027He\u0027s someone who\u0027s all cheering when things are going well, and then runs off to another team when there\u0027s a losing streak. They always shouts the loudest.\u0027\n \u0027So you support the same team all your life?\u0027\n \u0027Well, if you move away it\u0027s okay to change. No one will mind much unless you go to a real enemy.\u0027 She looked at their puzzled expressions, sighed and went on: \u0027Like Naphill United and the Whoppers, or Dolly Sisters and Dimwell Old Pals, or the Pigsty Hill Pork Packers and the Cockbill Boars. You know?\u0027\n When they clearly didn\u0027t, she continued: \u0027They hate each other. Always have done, always will. They are the bad matches. The shutters go up for those. I don\u0027t know what my neighbours would say if they saw me cheering a Dimmer.\u0027\n \u0027But that\u0027s dreadful!\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies.\n \u0027Excuse me, miss,\u0027 said Ponder, \u0027but most of those pairs are quite close to one another, so why do they hate one another so much?\u0027\n \u0027That at least is easy,\u0027 said Dr Hix. \u0027It\u0027s hard to hate people who are a long way away. You forget how dreadful they are. But you see a neighbour\u0027s warts every day.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s just the sort of cynical comment I\u0027d expect from a post-mortem communicator,\u0027 grumbled the Chair of Indefinite Studies.\n \u0027Or a realist,\u0027 said Ridcully, smiling. \u0027But Dolly Sisters and Dimwell are quite far apart, miss.\u0027\n Glenda shrugged. \u0027I know, but it\u0027s always been like that. That\u0027s how it is. That\u0027s all I know.\u0027\n \u0027Well, thank you... ?\u0027 There was no mistaking the hanging question.\n \u0027Glenda,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027I see there are a great many things we don\u0027t yet understand.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir. Everything.\u0027 She hadn\u0027t meant to say that aloud. It just escaped of its own accord.\n There was a stirring among the wizards, who were nonplussed because what had happened could not really have happened. The tea trolley might as well have neighed.\n Ridcully banged his hand on the table before the others could summon up words.\n \u0027Well said, miss,\u0027 he chuckled, as Glenda waited for the floor to open and swallow her. \u0027And I\u0027m sure that remark came from the heart, because I suspect it could not have come from the head.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, sir, but the gentleman did ask for my opinion.\u0027\n \u0027Now, that one was from the head. Well done,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027So do, therefore, give us the benefit of your thinking, Miss Glenda.\u0027\n Still in a kind of shock, Glenda looked into the Archchancellor\u0027s eyes and saw that it was no time to be less than bold, but that was unnerving too.\n \u0027Well, what\u0027s this all about, sir? If you want to play, just go and do it, yes? Why change things?\u0027\n \u0027The game of foot-the-ball is very behind the times, Miss Glenda.\u0027\n \u0027Well, so are you - Sorry, sorry, but, well. You know. Wizards are always wizards. Not a lot changes in here, does it? And then you talk about some Master of the Music to make a new chant, and that\u0027s not how it goes. The Shove makes up the chants. They just happen. They just, like, come out of the air. And the pies are pretty awful, that\u0027s true, but when you\u0027re in the Shove, and it\u0027s mucky weather, and the water\u0027s coming through your coat, and your shoes are leaking, and then you bite into your pie, and you know that everyone else is biting into their pie, and the grease slides down your sleeve, well, sir, I don\u0027t have the words for it, sir, I really don\u0027t, sir. There\u0027s a feeling I can\u0027t describe, but it\u0027s a bit like being a kid at Hogswatch, and you can\u0027t just buy it, sir, you can\u0027t write it down or organize it or make it shiny or make it tame. Sorry to speak out of turn, sirs, but that\u0027s the long and the short of it. You must have known it, sir. Didn\u0027t your father ever take you to a game?\u0027\n Ridcully looked down the table at the Council and noted a certain moistness of eye. Wizards were, largely, of that generation from which grandfathers are carved. They were also, largely, large, and awash with cynical crabbiness and the barnacles of the years, but... the smell of cheap overcoats in the rain, which always had a tint and taste of soot in it, and your father, or maybe your grandfather, lifting you on to his shoulders, and there you were, above all those cheap hats and scarves, and you could feel the warmth of the Shove, watch its tides, feel its heartbeat, and then, certainly, a pie would be handed up, or maybe half a pie if times were hard, and if they were really bad it might be a handful of fat greasy pease which were to be eaten one at a time to make them last longer... or when times were flush there might be a real treat, like a hot dog you didn\u0027t have to share, or a plate of scouse, with yellow fat beading on the top and lumps of gristle you could chew at on the way home, meat which now you would not give to a dog but which was sacred lotus eaten with the gods, in the rain, in the cheering, in the bosom of the Shove...\n The Archchancellor blinked. No time seemed to have passed, unless you count seventy years which had gone past like that. \u0027Er, very graphically argued,\u0027 he said, and pulled himself together. \u0027Interesting points well made. But, you see, we have a responsibility here. After all, this city was just a handful of villages before my university was built. We are concerned about the fighting in the streets yesterday. We heard a rumour that someone was killed because he supported the wrong team. We can\u0027t stand by and let this sort of thing happen.\u0027\n \u0027So you\u0027ll be shutting down the Assassins\u0027 Guild, will you, sir?\u0027\n There was a gasp from every mouth, including her own. The only rational thought that didn\u0027t flee from her mind was: I wonder if that job is still going in the Fools\u0027 Guild? The pay wasn\u0027t much, but they do know how to appreciate a pie.\n When she dared look, the Archchancellor was staring at the ceiling, while his fingers drummed on the table. I should have been more careful, Glenda whined in her own ear. Don\u0027t get chatty with nobs. You forget what you are, but they don\u0027t.\n The drumming stopped. \u0027Good point, well put,\u0027 said Ridcully, \u0027and I shall marshal my responses thusly.\u0027 He flicked a finger and, with a smell of gooseberries and a pop, a small red globe appeared in the air over the table.\n \u0027One: the Assassins, while deadly, are not random, and indeed are mostly a danger to one another. Assassination is only to be feared, generally speaking, by those powerful enough to have a stab, as it were, at defending themselves.\u0027\n Another little globe appeared.\n \u0027Two: it is an article of faith with them that property is undamaged. They are invariably courteous and considerate and notoriously silent, and would never dream of inhuming their target in a public street.\u0027\n A third globe appeared.\n \u0027Three: they are organized and therefore amenable to civic influence. Lord Vetinari is very keen on that sort of thing.\u0027\n And another globe popped into life.\n \u0027And four: Lord Vetinari is himself a trained Assassin, majoring in stealth and poisons. I am not sure he would share your opinion. And he is a Tyrant even if he has developed tyranny to such a point of metaphysical perfection that it is a dream rather than a force. He does not have to listen to you, you see. He doesn\u0027t even have to listen to me. He listens to the city. I don\u0027t know how he does, but he does. And he plays it like a violin\u0027�CRidcully paused, then went on�C\u0027or like the most complicated game you can imagine. The city works, not perfectly, but better than it has ever done. I think it\u0027s time for football to change too.\u0027 He smiled at her expression. \u0027What is your job, young lady? Because you are wasted in it.\u0027\n It was probably meant as a compliment, but Glenda, her head so bewilderingly full of the Archchancellor\u0027s words that they were trickling out of her ears, heard herself say, \u0027I\u0027m certainly not wasted, sir! You\u0027ve never eaten better pies than mine! I run the Night Kitchen!\u0027\n The metaphysics of real politics were not a subject of interest to most of those present, but they knew where they were with pies. She was the centre of attention already, but now it blazed with interest.\n \u0027You do?\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. \u0027We thought it was the pretty girl.\u0027\n \u0027Really?\u0027 said Glenda brightly. \u0027Well, I run it.\u0027\n \u0027So who does that wonderful pie you send up here sometimes, with the cheese pastry and the hot pickle layer?\u0027\n \u0027The Ploughman\u0027s Pie? Me, sir. My own recipe.\u0027\n \u0027Really? How do you manage to get the pickled onions to stay so hard and crispy in the baking? It\u0027s just amazing!\u0027\n \u0027My own recipe, sir,\u0027 said Glenda firmly. \u0027It wouldn\u0027t be mine if I told anyone else.\u0027\n \u0027Well said,\u0027 said Ridcully gleefully. \u0027You can\u0027t go around asking craftsmen the secrets of their trade, old chap. It\u0027s a thing you just don\u0027t do. Now, I am concluding this meeting, although what it has in fact concluded I shall decide later.\u0027 He turned back to Glenda. \u0027Thank you for coming here today, Miss Glenda, and I shall not enquire why a young lady who works in the Night Kitchen is pouring tea up here at nearly noon. Do you have any further advice for us?\u0027\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027since you ask... No, I really shouldn\u0027t say... \u0027\n \u0027This is hardly the moment for bashfulness, do you think?\u0027\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s about your strip, sir. That means your team colours. Nothing wrong with red and yellow, no one else uses those two, but, well, you want two big U\u0027s on the front, right? Like UU?\u0027 She waved her hands in the air.\n \u0027Yes, that is exactly right. After all, it\u0027s what we are.\u0027 Ridcully nodded.\n \u0027Are you sure? I mean, I know you gentlemen are bachelors and all, but... well, you\u0027ll look like you\u0027ve got bosoms. Honestly.\u0027\n \u0027Oh gods, sir, she\u0027s right,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027It will make a rather unfortunate shape... \u0027\n \u0027What kind of mind would see something like that in a pair of innocent letters?\u0027 the Lecturer in Recent Runes demanded angrily.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, sir,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027but every man watching the football has got one. And they would make up nicknames. They love doing that.\u0027\n \u0027I suspect you may be right,\u0027 said Ridcully, \u0027but we never had any trouble when I was rowing in the old days.\u0027\n \u0027Football followers are rather more robust in their language, sir,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Yes, and in those days we were pretty careless when it came to throwing fireballs, as I recall,\u0027 Ridcully mused. \u0027Oh dear, what a shame. I was looking forward to giving the old rag a bit of an airing again. Still, I\u0027m sure we can change the design a little to save embarrassment all round. Thank you once again, Miss Glenda. Bosoms, eh? Narrow escape there, all round. Good day to you.\u0027 He shut the door after the trolley, which Glenda was pushing as if in a race...\n Molly, the head maid in the Day Kitchen, was fretting at the end of the corridor beyond. She sagged with relief when Glenda came round the corner, teacups rattling.\n \u0027Was it all right? Did anything go wrong? I\u0027ll get into so much trouble if anything went wrong. Tell me nothing went wrong!\u0027\n \u0027It was all fine,\u0027 said Glenda. That got her a suspicious look.\n \u0027Are you sure? You owe me for this!\u0027\n The laws of favours are amongst the most fundamental in the multiverse. The first law is: nobody asks for just one favour; the second request (after the granting of the first favour), prefaced by \u0027and can I be really cheeky... ?\u0027 is the asking of the second favour. If the aforesaid second request is not granted, the second law ensures that the need for any gratitude for the first favour is nullified, and in accordance with the third law the favour giver has not done any favours at all, and the favour field collapses.\n But Glenda reckoned she\u0027d won a lot of favours over the years, and was owed a few herself. Besides, she had reason to believe that Molly had been spending the welcome break in dalliance with her boyfriend, who worked in the bakery.\n \u0027Can you get me in to the banquet on Wednesday night?\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, the butler chooses who gets those jobs,\u0027 said Molly.\n Ah yes, the tall, thin girls, Glenda thought.\n \u0027Why in the world would you want to get in, anyway?\u0027 Molly said. \u0027It\u0027s a lot of running around and not much pay, when all\u0027s said and done. I mean, we get some decent leftovers after a big affair, but what\u0027s that to you? Everyone knows that you\u0027re the leftover queen!\u0027 She paused, too awkwardly. \u0027I mean, we all know you\u0027re really good at making wonderful food with always a little something left over,\u0027 she gabbled. \u0027That\u0027s all I meant!\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t think you meant anything else,\u0027 said Glenda, keeping her voice level. But she raised it again to add, as Molly scurried off: \u0027I can pay back the favour right now! You\u0027ve got two floury handprints on your arse!\u0027\n The glare that came back was a small victory, but you have to take what you can get.\n Still, that strange interlude, which she was sure she would regret, had taken up a lot of time. She had to get the Night Kitchen organized.\n When the door had closed behind the rather forthright maid, Ridcully nodded meaningfully at Ponder. \u0027All right, Mister Stibbons. You were glancing at your thaumometer the whole time I was talking to her. Out with it.\u0027\n \u0027Some kind of entanglement,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027And there was me thinking that Vetinari was behind the business with the urn,\u0027 said Ridcully gloomily. \u0027I should have realized he\u0027s never that unsubtle.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I assumed it was going to be something like that right at the start,\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes.\n \u0027Indeed,\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. \u0027It crossed my mind as soon as I saw it in the paper.\u0027\n \u0027Gentlemen,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027I am humbled that as soon as I have an idea about what something is, it turns out that you all knew what it was. I am amazed.\u0027\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Dr Hix, \u0027but I don\u0027t have a clue what you\u0027re talking about.\u0027\n \u0027You are out of touch! You\u0027ve been spending too long underground, sir!\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes sternly.\n \u0027You don\u0027t often let me out, that\u0027s why! And can I remind you that I have to maintain a vital line of cosmic defence in this establishment here with a staff of exactly one? And he\u0027s dead!\u0027\n \u0027You mean Charlie? I remember old Charlie, keen worker nevertheless,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027Yes, but I have to keep rewiring him all the time,\u0027 sighed Hix. \u0027I do try to keep you abreast of things in my monthly reports. I hope you read them... ?\u0027\n \u0027Tell me, Doctor Hix,\u0027 said Ponder, \u0027did you experience anything unusual when that young lady was speaking so eloquently?\u0027\n \u0027Well, yes, I had a pleasant moment of happy recollection about my father.\u0027\n \u0027So did we all, I am sure,\u0027 said Ponder. There was sombre nodding around the table. \u0027I never knew my father. I was brought up by my aunts. I had d��j�� vu without the original vu.\u0027\n \u0027And it wasn\u0027t magic?\u0027 suggested the Lecturer in Recent Runes.\n \u0027No. Religion, I suspect,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027A god invoked, that sort of thing.\u0027\n \u0027Not invoked, Mustrum,\u0027 said Dr Hix. \u0027Summoned by bloodshed!\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I hope not,\u0027 said Ridcully, getting to his feet. \u0027I would like to try a little experiment this afternoon, gentlemen. We will not talk about football, we will not speculate about football, we will not worry about football - \u0027\n \u0027You are going to make us play it, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes glumly.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Ridcully, more than somewhat miffed at the spoiling of a perfectly good peroration. \u0027Just a little kick-about to help us get some hands-on experience of the game as it is played.\u0027\n \u0027Er. Strictly, under the new rules, by which I mean the ancient rules we are taking as our model, hands-on experience means no hands,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Well pointed out, that man. Put the word out, will you? Football practice on the lawn after lunch!\u0027\n One thing you had to remember when dealing with dwarfs was that while they shared the same world as you did, metaphorically they thought about it as if it were upside down. Only the richest and most influential of dwarfs lived in the deepest caverns. For a dwarf, a penthouse in the centre of the city would be some kind of slum. Dwarfs liked it dark and cool.\n It didn\u0027t stop there. A dwarf on the up and up was really on his uppers, and upper-class dwarfs were lower class. A dwarf who was rich, healthy and had respect and his own rat farm justifiably felt at rock bottom and was held in low esteem. When you talked to dwarfs, you turned your mind upside down. The city, too. Of course, when you dug down in Ankh-Morpork you just found more Ankh-Morpork. Thousands of years of it, ready to be dug out and shored up and walled in with the shiny dwarf brick.\n It was Lord Vetinari\u0027s \u0027Grand Undertaking\u0027. The city\u0027s walls corseted it like a fetishist\u0027s happiest dream. Gravity offered only a limited supply of up, but the deep loam of the plain had a limitless supply of down.\n Glenda was surprised, therefore, to find Shatta right at the surface in the Maul, alongside the really posh dress shops that were for human ladies. That made sense, however; if you were going to make a scandalous profit selling clothes, it made sense to camouflage yourself amongst other shops doing the same thing. She wasn\u0027t sure about the name, but apparently shatta meant \u0027a wonderful surprise\u0027 in Dwarfish, and if you started to laugh about that sort of thing then you would never have time to pause for breath.\n She approached the door with the apprehension of one who is certain that the moment she sets foot inside she will be charged five dollars a minute for breathing and then be held upside down and have all her wealth removed with a hook.\n And it was, indeed, classy. But it was dwarf classy. That meant an awful lot of chain mail, and enough weaponry to take over a city-but if you paid attention, you realized it was female chain mail and weaponry. That was how things were happening, apparently. Dwarf women had got fed up with looking like dwarf men all the time and were metaphorically melting down their breastplates in order to make something a little lighter and with adjustable straps.\n Juliet had explained this on the way down, although, of course, Juliet did not use the word \u0027metaphorically\u0027, it being several syllables beyond her range. There were battle-axes and war hammers, but all with that certain feminine touch: one war axe, apparently capable of cleaving a backbone lengthwise, was beautifully engraved with flowers. It was another world, and as she stood just inside the doorway looking around, Glenda felt relieved that there were other humans in the place. In fact, there were quite a few, and that was surprising. One of them, a young human woman with steel boots six inches high, gravitated towards them as if drawn by a magnet-and given the amount of ferrous metal on her body, a magnet was something she would never pass in a hurry. She was holding a tray of drinks.\n \u0027There\u0027s black mead, red mead and white mead,\u0027 she said, and then lowered her voice by a few decibels and three social classes. \u0027Actually, the red mead is really sherry and all the dwarf ladies are drinking it. They like not having to quaff.\u0027\n \u0027Do we have to pay for this?\u0027 said Glenda nervously.\n \u0027It\u0027s free,\u0027 said the girl. She indicated a bowl of small black things on the tray, each one pierced with a cocktail stick, and said slightly hopelessly, \u0027And do try the rat fruit.\u0027\n Before Glenda could stop her, Juliet had taken one and was chewing enthusiastically.\n \u0027What part of a rat is its fruit?\u0027 asked Glenda. The girl with the tray did not look directly at her.\n \u0027Well, you know shepherd\u0027s pie?\u0027 she said.\n \u0027I know twelve different recipes,\u0027 said Glenda in a moment of rare smugness. This was actually a lie. She probably knew about four recipes because there was only so much you could do with meat and potatoes, but the glittering metallic grandeur of the place was getting on her nerves and she felt the need to stick up for herself. And then realization dawned. \u0027Oh, you mean like traditional shepherd\u0027s pie,\u0027 she said, \u0027made with the - \u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid so,\u0027 said the girl, \u0027but they\u0027re very popular with the ladies.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t have any more, Jools,\u0027 said Glenda quickly.\n \u0027It\u0027s quite nice,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027Can\u0027t I have one more?\u0027\n \u0027Just one, then,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027That should even up the rat.\u0027 She helped herself to a sherry and the girl, balancing carefully as she managed three different things with two different hands, handed her a glossy brochure.\n Glenda glanced through it and knew her original impression had been right. This place was so expensive they didn\u0027t tell you the price of anything. You could always be sure things were going to be expensive when they didn\u0027t tell you the price. No point in looking through it, it\u0027d suck your wages out through your eyeballs. Free drinks? Oh, yes.\n With nothing else to do, she scanned the rest of the crowd. Everyone, except the growing and, in fact, quite large number of humans, had a beard. All dwarfs had beards. It was part of being a dwarf. Here, though, the beards were a little finer than you usually saw around the city and there had been some experimentation with perms and ponytails. There were mining pickaxes on view, it was true, but carried in expensively tooled bags as if the owner might spot a likely-looking coal seam on the way to the shops and wouldn\u0027t be able to help herself.\n She shared this thought with Juliet, who pointed down at the feet of another well-heeled customer and said, \u0027Wot? And spoil those gorgeous boots? They\u0027re Snaky Cleavehelms, they are! Four hundred dollars a pop, an\u0027 you\u0027ve to wait for six months!\u0027\n Glenda couldn\u0027t see the face of the boots\u0027 owner, but she did see the change in her body language. The hint of preening, even from the rear. Well, she thought, I suppose if you\u0027re going to spend all of a working family\u0027s yearly income on a pair of boots it\u0027s nice that someone notices.\n When you watch people, you forget that people are watching you. Glenda was not very tall, which meant that from her point of view dwarfs were not very short. And she realized that they were being approached in a determined kind of way by two dwarfs, one of whom was extremely expansive around the waist and wearing a breastplate so beautifully hammered and ornamented that taking it into battle would be an act of artistic vandalism. He�Cand you had to remember that all dwarfs were he unless they asserted otherwise�Chad, when he spoke, a voice that sounded like the darkest and most expensive type of dark chocolate, possibly smoked. And the hand he offered had so many rings on each finger that you had to look with care to realize that he was not wearing a gauntlet. And she was a she, Glenda was sure of it: the chocolate was just too rich and fruity.\n \u0027So glad you could come, my dears,\u0027 she said, and the chocolate swirled. \u0027I am Madame Sharn. I wondered if you could be of assistance to me? I really would not dream of asking, but I am, as you would put it, between a rock and a hard one.\u0027\n All this was, to Glenda\u0027s annoyance, addressed to Juliet, who was eating rat fruit as if there was no tomorrow, which presumably there had not been for the rat. She giggled.\n \u0027She\u0027s with me,\u0027 said Glenda, and, without meaning to, added, \u0027Madame?\u0027\n Madame waved another hand and more rings glistened. \u0027This salon is technically a mine and that means that under dwarf law I am the king of the mine and in my mine my rules go. And since I am King, I declare that I am Queen,\u0027 she said. \u0027Dwarf law bends and creaks but is not broken.\u0027\n \u0027Well,\u0027 Glenda began, \u0027we - Hey!\u0027\n This was to Madame\u0027s smaller companion, who was actually holding a tape measure up against Juliet. \u0027That is Pepe,\u0027 said Madame.\n \u0027Well, if he\u0027s going to take liberties like that I hope he\u0027s a woman,\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027Pepe is... Pepe,\u0027 said Madame calmly. \u0027And there is no changing him, as it were, or her. Labels are such unhelpful things, I feel.\u0027\n \u0027Especially yours, \u0027cos you don\u0027t put the prices on them,\u0027 said Glenda, out of sheer nervousness.\n \u0027Ah yes, you notice these things,\u0027 said Madame, with a wink that disarmed to the point of melting.\n Pepe looked up excitedly at Madame, who went on, \u0027I wonder if you, if she... if you both would mind joining me backstage? The matter is a little delicate.\u0027\n \u0027Ooh, yes,\u0027 said Juliet immediately.\n Out of nowhere, other human girls materialized among the crowd and carefully opened a path towards the back of the enormous room along which Madame progressed as though propelled by invisible forces.\n Glenda felt that the situation had suddenly got away from her, but it had been a good measure of sherry and it whispered to her, \u0027Why not let a situation get away from you every once in a while? Or even just once\u0027 She had no idea what she was expecting behind the gilded door at the far end, but she had not expected smoke and flames and shouting and someone screaming in a corner. The place looked like a foundry on the day they let the clowns in.\n \u0027Come on through. Don\u0027t let this disturb you,\u0027 said Madame. \u0027It\u0027s always like this at show time. Nerves, you know. Of course, everyone in this business is lowly strung and there is always this problem to begin with with the micromail. It\u0027s new, you see. According to dwarf law it must be hallmarked on every link and that would not only be sacrilege, but also bloody difficult to do.\u0027 Behind the scenes, it appeared that Madame became a little less chocolatey and a little more earthy.\n \u0027Micromail!\u0027 said Juliet, as if she had been shown the gateway to riches.\n \u0027You know what it is?\u0027 said Madame.\n \u0027She talks about nothing else,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Talks and talks.\u0027\n \u0027Well, of course, it\u0027s wonderful stuff,\u0027 said Madame. \u0027Almost as soft as cloth, certainly better than leather - \u0027\n \u0027 - and it doesn\u0027t chafe,\u0027 said Juliet.\n \u0027Which is always a consideration for the more traditional dwarf who will not wear cloth,\u0027 said Madame. \u0027Old tribal customs, how they hold us back, always pull us back. We haul ourselves out of the mine, but somehow we always drag a bit of the mine with us. If I had my way, silk would be reclassified as a metal. What is your name, young lady?\u0027\n \u0027Juliet,\u0027 said Glenda automatically, and then blushed. That was mumming, pure and simple. It was almost as bad as getting someone to spit on their handkerchief and wiping their face for them. The young lady with the drinks had followed them in and chose this moment to take Glenda\u0027s sherry glass and replace it with a full one.\n \u0027Would you mind just walking up and down a moment, Juliet?\u0027 said Madame.\n Glenda wanted to ask why, but since her mouth was full of sherry as an anti-embarrassment remedy, she let that one pass.\n Madame watched Juliet critically, one hand cupping the elbow of the other arm.\n \u0027Yes, yes. But I mean slowly, as if you were not in a hurry to get there and didn\u0027t care,\u0027 said Madame. \u0027Imagine you\u0027re a bird in the air, a fish in the sea. Wear the world.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, right,\u0027 said Juliet and started again.\n By the time Juliet was halfway across the floor for the second time, Pepe had burst into tears. \u0027Where has she been? Where was she trained?\u0027 he, or conceivably she, squeaked while clapping his or her cheeks with both hands. \u0027You must hire her at once!\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s already got a good steady job at the university,\u0027 Glenda said. But the sherry said, \u0027Once in a while isn\u0027t over yet. Don\u0027t spoil it!\u0027\n Madame, who clearly had an instinct for this kind of thing, put an arm around her shoulders. \u0027The problem with dwarf ladies, you see, is that a lot of us are a little shy about being the centre of attention. I also have to bear in mind that dwarf clothing is proving quite interesting to young humans of a certain turn of mind. Your daughter is human - \u0027 Madame turned briefly to Juliet. \u0027You are human, aren\u0027t you, dear? I find it pays to check.\u0027\n Juliet, apparently staring rapturously into a private world, nodded enthusiastically.\n \u0027Oh good,\u0027 said Madame. \u0027And while she is exquisitely well built and moves like a dream, she is not too much taller than the average dwarf and frankly, my dear, some of the ladies would aspire to being a little taller than they are. This may be letting the side up, but that walk, my word. Dwarfs have hips, of course, but they seldom know what to do with them... I\u0027m sorry, have I said something wrong?\u0027\n The half-pint of sherry so recently consumed by Glenda finally gave way under the pressure of her rage. \u0027I am not her mother. She is my friend.\u0027\n Madame shot her another of those looks that gave her the feeling that her brain was being taken out and examined minutely. \u0027Then would you mind if I paid your friend\u0027-there was a pause-\u0027five dollars to model for me this afternoon?\u0027\n \u0027All right,\u0027 said the sherry to Glenda. \u0027You wondered where I was going to take you and here you are. Can you see the view? What are you going to do now?\u0027\n \u0027Twenty-five dollars,\u0027 said Glenda.\n Pepe clapped her, or possibly his, cheeks again and screamed, \u0027Yes! Yes!\u0027\n \u0027And a shop discount,\u0027 said Glenda.\n Madame gave her a long-drawn-out stare. \u0027Excuse me one moment,\u0027 said the dwarf.\n She walked over and took Pepe\u0027s arm, walking him at some speed to the corner. Glenda could not hear what was said over some nearby riveting and someone having hysterics. Madame came back smirking artificially, Pepe trailing her. \u0027I have a show starting in ten minutes and my best model has dropped her pickaxe on her foot. We shall negotiate any future engagements. And will you please stop that jumping up and down, Pepe?\u0027\n Glenda blinked. I cannot believe I just did that, she thought. Twenty-five dollars for putting some clothes on! That\u0027s more than I earn in a month! That\u0027s just not right. And the sherry said, \u0027What exactly is wrong here? Would you dress up in chain mail and parade in front of a lot of strangers for twenty-five dollars?\u0027\n Glenda shuddered. Certainly not, she thought.\n \u0027Well, there you are then,\u0027 said the sherry.\n But it will all end in tears, thought Glenda.\n \u0027No, you\u0027re just saying that because part of you thinks it should,\u0027 said the sherry. \u0027You know there are far worse things that a girl could do for twenty-five dollars than put some clothes on. Take them off, for a start.\u0027\n But what will the neighbours say? was the last despairing argument from Glenda.\n \u0027They can stick it up their jumper,\u0027 said the sherry. \u0027Anyway, they won\u0027t know, will they? Dolly Sisters doesn\u0027t shop in the Maul, it\u0027s far too grand. Look, we\u0027re looking at twenty-five dollars. Twenty-five dollars to do what you couldn\u0027t stop her doing now with a length of lead pipe. Just look at her face! She looks as if someone has lit a lamp inside.\u0027\n It was true.\n Oh, all right then, thought Glenda.\n \u0027Good,\u0027 said the sherry. \u0027And incidentally, I\u0027m feeling lonely.\u0027\n And as the tray was at Glenda\u0027s elbow again, she reached out automatically. Juliet was now surrounded by dwarfs and, by the sound of it, she was having a lightning education in how to wear clothing. But it wouldn\u0027t matter, would it? The truth of the matter was that Juliet would look good in a sack. Somehow, everything she wore fitted perfectly. Glenda, on the other hand, never found anything good in her size and indeed seldom found anything in her size. In theory, something should fit, but all she ever found was facts, which are so unbecoming.\n \u0027Well, we have a nice day for it,\u0027 said the Archchancellor.\n \u0027Looks like rain,\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes hopefully.\n \u0027I suggest two teams of five on a side,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Only a friendly game, of course, just to get the hang of it.\u0027\n Ponder Stibbons made no comment. Wizards were competitive. It was a part of wizardry. Wizards have no more idea of a friendly game than cats have of a friendly mouse. The college lawns stretched out in front of them. \u0027Of course, next time we\u0027ll have proper jerseys,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Mrs Whitlow already has her girls working on that. Mister Stibbons!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Archchancellor?\u0027\n \u0027You shall be the keeper of the rules and adjudicate fairly. I will, of course, be captain of one of the teams and you, Runes, will captain the other. As Archchancellor, I suggest that I pick my team first and then you will be at liberty to choose yours.\u0027\n \u0027It isn\u0027t actually supposed to work like that, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027You pick a team member and then he picks a team member until you have enough team members or have run out of team members who aren\u0027t grossly fat or trembling with nerves. At least that\u0027s how I remember it.\u0027 Ponder, in his youth, had spent far too long standing next to the fat kid.\n \u0027Oh well, if that\u0027s how it\u0027s done, then I suppose we shall have to do it that way,\u0027 said the Archchancellor with bad grace. \u0027Stibbons, it will be your task to penalize the opposing side for any infringements they make.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you mean that I should penalize either side for any infringements they make, Archchancellor?\u0027 he said. \u0027It has to be fair.\u0027\n Ridcully looked at him with his mouth open as if Ponder had mentioned a concept that was totally alien. \u0027Oh yes, I suppose it has to be like that.\u0027\n A variety of wizards had turned out this afternoon from curiosity, a suspicion that being there might turn out to be a good career move, and the prospect of maybe seeing some colleagues travelling across the lawn on their noses.\n Oh dear, thought Ponder as the choosing began. It was just like school again, but at school nobody wanted the fat boy. Here, of course, it had to be a case of nobody wanted the fattest boy, which, since the departure of the Dean, was a matter of fine judgement.\n Ponder reached into his robes and pulled out a whistle or, perhaps, the grandfather of all whistles, eight inches long and as thick as a generous pork sausage.\n \u0027Where did that come from, Mister Stibbons?\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027As a matter of fact, Archchancellor, I found it in the study of the late Evans the Striped.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a fine whistle,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n It was an innocent sentence that managed to hint quite silently that such a fine whistle should not be in the hands of Ponder Stibbons when it could be in the ownership of, for example, the Archchancellor of a university. Ponder spotted this because he had been expecting it. \u0027I shall need this to alert and control the behaviour of both teams,\u0027 he said haughtily. \u0027You made me the referee, Archchancellor, and I\u0027m afraid that for the duration of the game I am, as it were,\u0027 he hesitated, \u0027in charge.\u0027\n \u0027This university is a hierarchy, you understand, Stibbons?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir, and this is a game of football. I believe that the procedure is to put the football down and when the whistle is blown each side will attempt to hit the goal of the opposing side with the ball while trying to prevent the ball hitting their own goal. Have we all understood that?\u0027\n \u0027It seems pretty clear to me,\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. There was a murmur of agreement.\n \u0027Nevertheless, before the game I demand a blow on the whistle.\u0027\n \u0027Of course, Archchancellor, but then you must give it me back. I am the custodian of the game.\u0027 He handed over the whistle.\n On Ridcully\u0027s first attempt at blowing he dislodged a spider that had been living a blameless yet frugal life for the last twenty years and deposited him in the beard of the Professor of Natural Studies, who was just passing.\n The second blow shook free the fossilized pea inside and filled the air with echoes of liquid brass. And then...\n Ridcully froze. His face flushed from the neck upwards at speed. The sound of his next drawn breath was like the vengeance of the gods. His stomach expanded, his eyes became pinpoints, thunder rolled overhead and he roared, \u0027WHY HAVEN\u0027T YOU BOYS BROUGHT YOUR KIT?!\u0027\n St Elmo\u0027s fire roared along the length of the whistle. The sky darkened and fear gripped every watching soul as time reversed and there stood the giant, maniacally screaming Evans the Striped. The instigator of badly forged notes from your mother, the enthusiast for long runs in the sleet, the promoter of communal showers as a cure for adolescent shyness and the one who, if you didn\u0027t bring your proper gear, would make you PLAY IN YOUR PANTS. Venerable wizards who had faced down the most cunning of monsters through the decades trembled in damp adolescent fear as the scream went on and on, to be halted as sharply as it started.\n Ridcully fell forward on to the turf.\n \u0027I do apologize for that,\u0027 said Dr Hix, lowering his staff. \u0027A slightly evil deed, of course, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll agree that it was necessary in the circumstances. The skull ring, remember? University statute? And that was a clear case of possession by artefact if ever I saw one.\u0027\n The collected wizards, the cold sweat beginning to evaporate, nodded sagely. Oh, yes. It was regrettably necessary, they agreed. For his own good, they agreed. Had to be done, they agreed. And this verdict was echoed by Ridcully himself when he opened his eyes and said, \u0027What the hell was that?\u0027\n \u0027Er, the soul of Evans the Striped, I think, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027In the whistle, was it?\u0027 Ridcully rubbed his head.\n \u0027Yes, I think so,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027And who hit me?\u0027\n A general shuffling and murmuring indicated that by democratic agreement this was a question that could best be answered by Dr Hix.\n \u0027It was acceptable treachery under college statute, sir. Wouldn\u0027t mind the whistle for the Dark Museum, if nobody objects.\u0027\n \u0027Quite so, quite so,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Saw the problem, sorted it out. Well done that man.\u0027\n \u0027Do you think I could be allowed an evil chuckle, sir?\u0027\n Ridcully brushed himself down. \u0027No. We shall forgo the whistle, Mister Stibbons. And now, gentlemen, let the game commence.\u0027\n And thus, after a certain amount of bickering, Unseen University\u0027s first football match in decades began. Instantly, from Ponder Stibbons\u0027s point of view, various problems arose. The most pressing one was that all the wizards were dressed as wizards, which was to say alike. Ponder ordered the teams to play hats on and hats off, which caused another row. And that particular problem was exacerbated further because there were so many collisions that even the officially hatted kept losing theirs. And then the game was paused because it was declared that the statue commemorating Archchancellor Scrubbs\u0027s discovery of blit was in fact three inches narrower than the venerable statue of Archchancellor Flanker discovering the Third Breakfast, thus giving an unfair advantage to the hatless squad.\n But all these problems, foreseeable and inescapable, paled into insignificance compared with the problem of the ball. It was an official ball�CPonder had made certain of that. But pointy shoes, even if they have a very long point, cannot absorb the impact of the human foot kicking what is, when all is said and screamed, a piece of wood with a thin cloth and leather wrapping. Eventually, as another wizard was helped away with a sprained ankle, even Ridcully was moved to say, \u0027This is damn nonsense, Stibbons! There has got to be something better than this.\u0027\n \u0027Bigger boots?\u0027 suggested the Lecturer in Recent Runes.\n \u0027The kind of boots you need for kicking this would slow you right down,\u0027 said Ponder.\n \u0027Besides, the men on the urn had nothing at all on their feet. I suggest we consider this research. What do we need, Stibbons?\u0027\n \u0027A better ball, sir. And some attempt at running about. And a general consensus that it is not a good idea to stop to re-light your pipe in the middle of play. A more sensible type of goal, because running into a stone statue is painful. Some grasp, however small, of the notion of teamwork in a gaming situation. A resolution not to run away if a member of the opposing team is rushing towards you. An understanding of the fact that you do not handle the ball in any circumstances; may I remind you that I gave up stopping play because of this since you gentlemen, when you were excited, persisted in picking it up and, in one case, hiding it behind your back, and standing on it. I would like to point out at this juncture that a sense of direction is worth cultivating vis-��-vis the goal that is yours and the goal that is theirs; inviting as it may be, there is no point in kicking the ball into your own goal, and nor should you congratulate and pat on the back anyone who achieves this feat. Out of the three goals scored in our match, the number scored by players into their own goal was\u0027-he paused and looked down at his clipboard-\u0027three. This is a commendably high level of scoring, compared with football as currently played, though once again I must stress that issues of direction and goal ownership are of pivotal importance. A tactic, which I admit looked promising, was for the players to cluster thickly around their own goal so there was no possibility of anything getting past them. I regret, however, that if both teams do this you do not have a game so much as a tableau. A more promising tactic, which seemed to be adopted by one or two of you, was to lurk near the opponents\u0027 goal so that if the ball came in your direction you would be ideally placed to get it past the custodian of the goal. The fact that in some cases you and the opposing custodian leaned companionably against the goal, sharing a cigarette and watching the play up-field, showed a decent spirit and may possibly be a good starting point for some more advanced tactics, but I do not think this should be encouraged. On this general topic, I have to assume that retiring from the field of play for the call of nature or a breather is acceptable, but doing so for a snack is not. My feeling, Archchancellor, is that our colleagues\u0027 general desire to be never more than twenty minutes from some savouries may be satisfactorily catered for by a pause in the middle of the game. Happily, if they changed ends at that point, that would satisfy the complaints about one goal being larger than the other. Yes?\u0027 This was to the Chair of Indefinite Studies.\n \u0027If we change ends,\u0027 said the Chair, who had put his hand up, \u0027will that then mean that the goals that were scored into our own goal will now become goals scored against the opposing team since that goal is now physically theirs?\u0027\n Ponder considered the metaphysics of answering this one and settled for, \u0027No, of course not. I have a whole list of other notes, Archchancellor, and regrettably they add up to us not being very good at football.\u0027\n The wizards fell silent. \u0027Let\u0027s start with the ball,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027I\u0027ve got an idea about the ball.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir. I thought you would.\u0027\n \u0027Then come and see me after dinner.\u0027\n Juliet had been sucked into the manic circus that was the backstage area of Shatta, and no one was paying Glenda any attention whatsoever. Just for now, she was a hindrance, surplus, no use to anyone, an obstruction to be worked around, an onlooker in the game. A little way away, a handsome young dwarf with a double ponytail beard was waiting patiently while a temporary rivet was put into what looked like a silver cuirass. She was surrounded by workers in much the same way as a knight is when his vassals must dress him for combat. Standing a little apart from them were two taller dwarfs, whose weaponry looked slightly more functional than beautiful. They were male. Glenda knew this simply because any female of any sapient species knows the look of a man who has nothing very much to do in an environment that, for this time, is clearly occupied by and totally under the control of females. It looked as though they were on guard.\n Propelled by the sherry, she wandered over. \u0027That must cost a lot of money,\u0027 she said to the nearest guard. He looked slightly embarrassed by the approach.\n \u0027You\u0027re telling me. Moonsilver, they call it. We\u0027re even having to walk down the catwalk with her. They say it\u0027s the coming thing, but I dunno. It won\u0027t take an edge and it wouldn\u0027t stop a decent blade. You need Igors to help you smelt it, too. They say it\u0027s worth even more than platinum. Looks good, though, and they say you hardly know you\u0027re wearing it. It\u0027s not what my granddad would have called a metal, but they say that we have to move with the times. Personally, I wouldn\u0027t even hang it on the wall, but there you go.\u0027\n \u0027Girl\u0027s armour,\u0027 said the other guard.\n \u0027What about this micromail stuff?\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027Ah, different pocketful of rats entirely, miss,\u0027 said the first guard. \u0027I hear they set up and forge it right here in the city, \u0027cos the best craftsmen are here. Just the job, eh? Chain mail as fine as cloth and strong as steel! It\u0027ll get cheaper, too, they say, and most of all it doesn\u0027t - \u0027\n \u0027Wotcher, Glendy, guess who?\u0027\n Someone tapped Glenda on the shoulder. She turned round and saw a vision of heavily but tastefully armoured beauty. It was Juliet, but Glenda only knew this because of the milky-blue eyes. Juliet was wearing a beard.\n \u0027Madame says I\u0027d better wear this,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s not dwarf if it don\u0027t include a beard. What d\u0027you think?\u0027\n This time the sherry got in first.\n \u0027It\u0027s actually rather attractive,\u0027 said Glenda, still in mild shock. \u0027It\u0027s very�Csilvery.\u0027\n It was a female beard, she could tell. It looked styled and stylish and didn\u0027t have bits of rat in it.\n \u0027Madame says there\u0027s a place saved for you in the front row,\u0027 said Juliet.\n \u0027Oh, I couldn\u0027t sit in the front row - \u0027 Glenda began, on automatic, but the sherry cut in with, \u0027Shut up, stop thinking like your mother, will you, and go and sit down in the damn front row.\u0027\n One of the ever-present young ladies chose this exact moment to take Glenda by the hand and lead her slightly unsteady feet through the settling chaos, out through the door and back into fairyland. There was indeed a seat waiting for her.\n Fortunately, although in the front row it was off to one side. She would have died of shame had it been right in the middle. She clutched her handbag in both hands and risked a look along the row. It was packed. It wasn\u0027t exclusively dwarf, either; there were a number of human ladies, smartly dressed, a little on the skinny side (in her opinion), almost offensively at ease and all talking.\n Another sherry mystically appeared in her hand and, as the noise stopped with rat-trap sharpness, Madame Sharn came out through the curtain and began to address the crowded hall. Glenda thought, I wish I\u0027d worn a better coat... At which point the sherry tucked her up and put her to bed.\n Glenda only started to think properly again some time later, when she was hit on the head by a bunch of flowers. They struck her just over the ear and as expensive petals rained around her she looked up at the beaming, radiant face of Juliet, at the very edge of the catwalk, halfway through the motions of shouting \u0027Duck!\u0027\n ... And there were more flowers flying and people standing and cheering, and music, and in general the feeling of being under a waterfall with no water but inexhaustible torrents of sound and light. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-7.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: \n Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) \n The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. \n Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about football—the most important thing about football—is that it is never just about football.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
