{"id":94964,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u0027She\u0027s got a point,\u0027 said a man in a butcher\u0027s apron. \u0027I\u0027ve seen him running around everywhere and I\u0027ve never seen him carrying any limbs.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s true,\u0027 said the baker. \u0027And anyway, didn\u0027t he do all those lovely candles at the banquet last night? That doesn\u0027t sound very orc-like to me.\u0027 \u0027And,\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs (no relation), \u0027he was training us yesterday and he never once said, \"Get in there, lads, and tear their \u0027eads off\".\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said the butler, who was making no friends as far as Glenda was concerned. \u0027Humans don\u0027t tear off heads, not like orcs.\u0027 An \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027 echoed in the distance. \u0027He\u0027s been teaching us kinds of stuff you\u0027d never think about,\u0027 said the bledlow, \u0027like playing the game with a blindfold on. Amazing stuff. More like filosopy than football, but damn good stuff.\u0027 \u0027Tactical thinking and combat analysis is part of the orc make-up,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027See! No one who uses make-up is going to tear your head off, right?\u0027 \u0027Didn\u0027t you meet my ex-wife?\u0027 said the baker. \u0027Well, I\u0027d draw the line if you wore make-up,\u0027 said the butcher to general amusement. \u0027Being an orc is one thing, but we don\u0027t want a funny one.\u0027 Glenda looked down at Nutt. He was crying. \u0027My friends, I thank you for your trust in me,\u0027 he said. \u0027Well, you know, you\u0027re like part of the team,\u0027 said Bledlow Nobbs (no relation), whose smile almost managed to conceal his nervousness. \u0027Thank you, Mister Nobbs, that means a lot to me,\u0027 said Nutt, standing up. That was quite a complex movement. It stayed in Glenda\u0027s mind for ever afterwards as a kind of slow-motion scene of bursting chains and cracking wood when Nutt stood up as though he had been restrained by cobwebs. Pieces of chain spun off and hit the wall. Padlocks broke. As for the couch, barely one piece remained attached to another. It dropped to the floor as so much firewood. \u0027RUN FOR IT, LADS!\u0027 You would have needed some kind of special micrometer to work out which man said it first, but the stampede along the corridor was swift and over very quickly. \u0027You know,\u0027 said Trev, after a few moments\u0027 silence, \u0027at one point I thought this was all goin\u0027 very well.\u0027 \u0027Those women,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027what were they?\u0027 Nutt stood forlornly in the wreckage; a length of chain slithered off him like a serpent and landed on the flagstones. \u0027Them?\u0027 he said. \u0027They are the Little Sisters of Perpetual Velocity. They come from Ephebe. I think the name for their species is Furies. I think Ladyship sent them in case I tried to hurt anybody.\u0027 The words came out without emphasis or emotion. \u0027But you haven\u0027t hurt anyone,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027But they ran away,\u0027 said Nutt, \u0027because of what I am.\u0027 \u0027Well, you know, they\u0027re ordinary people,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027They\u0027re - \u0027 \u0027Twits,\u0027 said Trev. Nutt turned and walked down the opposite corridor, kicking off the remnants of wood and chain. \u0027But the world is full of ordinary people.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t just let \u0027im go like that,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027You just can\u0027t. Look at \u0027im! \u0027e looks like \u0027e\u0027s been kicked.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m \u0027is boss, that\u0027s my job,\u0027 said Trev. Glenda caught Trev by the arm. \u0027No, I\u0027ll sort this out. Now, you listen to me, Trev Likely, under all that gab, you\u0027re a decent sort, so I\u0027ll tell you this: see Juliet over there? You know her, she works in the kitchens. You wrote her a lovely poem, didn\u0027t you? Ever heard of Emberella? Everyone\u0027s heard of Emberella. Well, you might not be my first choice for Prince Charming, but there\u0027s probably plenty worse.\u0027 \u0027What the hell are you talkin\u0027 about?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Juliet\u0027s going to be leaving soon, isn\u0027t that right, Jools?\u0027 Juliet\u0027s face was a picture. \u0027Well, er - \u0027 \u0027And that\u0027s because she\u0027s been that girl in the papers.\u0027 \u0027What, the shiny dwarf one? With a beard?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s her!\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027She\u0027s going to go off with the circus, well, you know what I mean. With the fashion show, at least.\u0027 \u0027But she hasn\u0027t got a beard,\u0027 said Trev. Blushing, Juliet delved into her apron and to Glenda\u0027s surprise produced the beard. \u0027They let me keep it,\u0027 she said, with a nervous giggle. \u0027Right,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You say you love him. Trev, I don\u0027t know whether you love her or not, time to make up your mind. You\u0027re both grown up, well, strictly speaking, and so you better sort yourselves out, \u0027cos I don\u0027t see any fairy godmothers around. As for Mister Nutt, he hasn\u0027t got anyone.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s gonna leave the city?\u0027 said Trev, realization dawning slowly through a male mind. \u0027Oh, yes. For quite a long time, I suspect,\u0027 said Glenda. She watched his face carefully. You haven\u0027t got much learning and you haven\u0027t opened a book in your life, Trevor Likely, but you are smart and you must know there is a wrong way and a right way to reply to what I have just told you. She watched the high-speed changes around his eyes as he thought, and then he said, \u0027Well, that\u0027s nice. It\u0027s the kind of thing she\u0027s always dreamed of. I\u0027m very happy for her.\u0027 You cunning bastard, you actually got it right, Glenda thought. You\u0027re not appearing to be thinking about yourself at all, \u0027cos you know I\u0027d have no time for you if you were. And who knows, you might just be genuine. In fact, heavens help me, I think you are, but I\u0027d pull all my own teeth out rather than tell you. \u0027She likes you, you like her and I\u0027ve made a lot of silly mistakes. The two of you, sort out what you want to do. And now, if I were you I\u0027d run, before anyone else beats you to it. And can I offer you a word of advice, Trev? Don\u0027t be smart, be clever.\u0027 Trev took Glenda by the shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks. \u0027Was that smart or clever?\u0027 \u0027Get away with you, Trev Likely!\u0027 she said, pushing him away, in the hope that he wouldn\u0027t notice her blush. \u0027And now I\u0027m going to see where Mister Nutt has gone.\u0027 \u0027I know where he\u0027s gone,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I thought I just told you two to go off and live happily ever after,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You won\u0027t find \u0027im without me,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Glenda, but we like him too.\u0027 \u0027Do you think we should tell somebody?\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027And what will they do?\u0027 Glenda snapped. \u0027It\u0027ll just be like that lot back there. All hanging around in the hope that somebody will come up with an idea. Anyway,\u0027 she added, \u0027I\u0027m sure the wizards upstairs know all about him. Oh yes, I bet they do.\u0027 She had to admit, ten minutes later, that Trev had been right. She probably wouldn\u0027t have noticed the door on the other side of another cluttered, abandoned cellar. Light shone from under the door. \u0027I followed \u0027im once,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Everyone should have a place to call their own.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Glenda, and she pushed open the door. She might as well have opened an oven. There were candles of every size and every colour and many of them were burning. And in the middle of it was Nutt, sitting behind a ramshackle table, which was covered with candles. In front of him they burned in every colour. He was staring at them with a blank expression, and did not look up as they approached. \u0027You know, I fear that I will never really get the hang of blue,\u0027 he said, as if to the air. \u0027Orange, of course, is ridiculously easy and red goes without saying and green is not difficult at all, but the best blue I could achieve, I have to admit, is very largely green... \u0027 His voice trailed off. \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Do you mean, am I all right apart from being an orc?\u0027 said Nutt, with a very small smile. \u0027Well, yes, but that\u0027s not really your fault.\u0027 \u0027It can\u0027t really be true, can it?\u0027 said Trev. Glenda turned on him. \u0027What good is it saying that?\u0027 she said. \u0027Well, they were supposed to have died out hundreds of years ago.\u0027 \u0027Annihilated,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027But some survived. I fear that when this oversight is revealed, there will be those who will endeavour to rectify the situation.\u0027 Trev looked blankly at Glenda. \u0027He means he thinks they\u0027re going to try to kill him,\u0027 she said. Nutt stared at his candles. \u0027I must accumulate worth. I must be helpful. I must be friendly. I must make friends.\u0027 \u0027If anyone comes to hurt you,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027I will kill them. I\u0027m sure you won\u0027t try to pull a leg off, but I might. Trev, this needs a woman\u0027s touch.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I can see that.\u0027 \u0027That wasn\u0027t clever, Trev Likely. No, Mister Nutt, you stay there,\u0027 said Glenda, dragging Trev and Juliet back out into the corridor. \u0027Off you go, I want to talk to him alone.\u0027 Nutt hung his head as she stepped back in. \u0027I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m spoiling it for everyone,\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s happened to your claws, Mister Nutt?\u0027 He stretched out his arm and with a faint noise the claws extended. \u0027Oh, well, that\u0027s convenient,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027At least that means you can change your shirt.\u0027 She thumped the table so the candles jumped. \u0027And now, get up!\u0027 she screamed. \u0027You are supposed to be training the team, Mister Nutt, don\u0027t you remember? You\u0027re supposed to be going out there and showing them how to play the football!\u0027 \u0027I must accumulate worth,\u0027 said Nutt, staring at the candles. \u0027Then train the team, Mister Nutt! How can you be so certain that the orcs were that bad in any case?\u0027 \u0027We did terrible things.\u0027 \u0027They,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027They, not we, not you. And one thing I am certain of is that in a war no one is going to say that the other side is made up of very nice people. Now, how about you just run along to training? How hard can it be?\u0027 \u0027You saw what happened,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027It could be very bad indeed.\u0027 He picked up a nearly blue candle. \u0027I must think.\u0027 \u0027Okay,\u0027 said Glenda. She shut the door carefully behind her, walked a little way along the corridor and looked up at the dripping pipes. \u0027I know someone is listening. I could hear the creaking pipes. Come out right now.\u0027 There was no reply. She shrugged and then hurried along the labyrinth until she reached the steps to the Library, ran up them and headed for the Librarian\u0027s desk. As she approached it, his big grinning face appeared above it. \u0027I want - \u0027 she began. The Librarian rose slowly, put a finger to his lips and placed a book on the table in front of her. The three-letter title, silver on black, was ORC. He looked her up and down, as if trying to reach a conclusion, then opened the book, and turned the pages with exquisite care, given the thickness of those fingers, until he found the page he had been looking for. He held it up in front of her. There had been no time for breakfast today, but it\u0027s still possible to throw up when there\u0027s nothing left to throw. And if you needed to vomit, the woodcut held up beneath the Librarian\u0027s hands would be a sure-fire medicine. He put the book down on the desktop, reached down again and produced a barely used handkerchief and, after some rummaging around, a glass of water. \u0027I don\u0027t have to believe that,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027It\u0027s a drawing. It\u0027s not real.\u0027 The Librarian\u0027s thumb went up and he nodded. He put the book under one arm and grabbed her with another and led her with surprising speed out of the door into the great maze of halls and corridors of the university. Their breathless journey finished in front of a door on which was painted \u0027Department of Post-Mortem Communications\u0027. The paint, however, had peeled somewhat and under the bright new title could just be made out the letters NECR and what could possibly be one half of a skull. The door opened�Cany door pushed by the Librarian would assuredly open. Glenda heard the clink of the catch falling on to the floor inside. In the middle of the floor that was revealed stood a hideous figure. Its horrifying countenance had less than the effect it might have done, because from it dangled a quite readable label that said \u0027Boffo Novelty and Joke Emporium. Improved Necromancer\u0027s Mask. Sale Price AM$3\u0027. This was removed to reveal the more salubrious countenance of Dr Hix. \u0027There really is no need to - \u0027 he said, and then spotted the Librarian. \u0027Oh, can I help you?\u0027 The Librarian held up the book and Dr Hix groaned. \u0027That again,\u0027 he said. \u0027All right, what do you want?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve got an orc down in the cellars,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Yes, I know,\u0027 said Dr Hix. The Librarian had a big face, but it nevertheless was not large enough to accommodate all of the surprise he wished to show. The head of the Department of Post-Mortem Communications shrugged and sighed. \u0027Look,\u0027 he said, as if weary of having to explain so often, and sighed again. \u0027I am supposed to be the bad person as defined by university statute, right? I am supposed to listen at doors. Supposed to dabble in the black arts. I\u0027ve got the skull ring. I\u0027ve got the staff with the silver skull on it - \u0027 \u0027And a joke-shop mask?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Quite serviceable as a matter of fact,\u0027 said Hix, haughtily. \u0027Rather more frightening than the original thing and washable, which is always a consideration in this department. Anyway, the Archchancellor was down here weeks ago, after the same stuff you are, I very much imagine.\u0027 \u0027Were the orcs terrible creatures?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I think I can probably show you,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027This gentleman has already shown me the picture in the book,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Was it the one with the eyeballs?\u0027 Glenda found the memory only too vivid. \u0027Yes!\u0027 \u0027Oh, there\u0027s worse than that,\u0027 said Hix happily. \u0027And I suppose you want the proof?\u0027 He half turned his head. \u0027Charlie?\u0027 A skeleton walked out through black curtains at the far end of the room. It was holding a mug. There was something curiously depressing about the slogan on said mug, which ran: \u0027Necromancers Do It All Night\u0027. \u0027Don\u0027t be scared,\u0027 said Dr Hix. \u0027I\u0027m not,\u0027 Glenda said, terrified to her insteps. \u0027I\u0027ve seen the insides of a slaughterhouse. It\u0027s part of the job and, anyway, he\u0027s polished.\u0027 \u0027Thank you very much,\u0027 the skeleton articulated. \u0027But \"Necromancers Do It All Night\"? That\u0027s a bit pathetic, isn\u0027t it? I mean, don\u0027t you think it\u0027s trying a bit too hard?\u0027 \u0027It was hard enough to get that one made,\u0027 said Dr Hix. \u0027We\u0027re not the most popular department in the university. Charlie, the young lady wants to know about orcs.\u0027 \u0027Again?\u0027 said the skeleton, handing the mug to the doctor. It had a rather hoarse voice, but on the whole far less dreadful than it might have been. Apart from anything else, his bones were, well, apart from anything else, and floated in the air as if they were the only visible parts of an invisible body. The jaw moved as Charlie went on: \u0027Well, I think we\u0027ve still got the memory in the sump \u0027cos, you remember, we called it up for Ridcully. I haven\u0027t got round to wiping it yet.\u0027 \u0027Memory of what?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027It\u0027s a kind of magic,\u0027 said Hix loftily. He continued. \u0027It would take too long to explain.\u0027 Glenda didn\u0027t like this. \u0027Let\u0027s have it in a nutshell, then.\u0027 \u0027Okay. We\u0027re now quite certain that what we call the passage of time is in fact the universe being destroyed and instantly rebuilt in the smallest instant of eventuality that it is possible to have. While the process is instant at every point, nevertheless to renew the whole Universe takes approximately five days, we believe. Interestingly enough - \u0027 \u0027Can I have it in a smaller nut?\u0027 \u0027So you don\u0027t want to hear about Houseman\u0027s theory of the Universal Memory?\u0027 \u0027Possibly the size of a walnut,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Very well, then, can you imagine this: current thinking is that the old universe is not destroyed in the instant the new universe is created, a process which, incidentally, has been happening an untold billion number of times since I have been talking - \u0027 \u0027Yes, I can believe that. Can we try for a pistachio?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Copies of the universe are kept. We don\u0027t know how, we don\u0027t know where, and it beats the hell out of me trying to imagine how it all works. But we\u0027re finding that it is sometimes possible to, er, read this memory in certain circumstances. How am I doing in terms of nut dimensions?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve got some kind of magic mirror?\u0027 said Glenda flatly. \u0027That\u0027s it, if you want the size of a pine nut,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027Pine nuts are actually seeds,\u0027 said Glenda smugly. \u0027So, what you\u0027re saying is that everything that happens stays happened somewhere and you can look at it if you have the knowing?\u0027 \u0027That is a magnificent distillation of the situation,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027Which is incredibly helpful while at the same time inaccurate in every possible way. But, as you put it, we use a\u0027�Cand here he gave a little shudder�C\u0027magic mirror, as you put it. We recently looked at the battle of Orc Deep for the Archchancellor. That was the last known battle in which the race known as orcs were deployed.\u0027 \u0027Deployed?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Used,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027Used? And you can find something like that in the total history of everything there has ever been?\u0027 \u0027Ahem. It helps to have an anchor,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027Something that was present. And all I am going to tell you, young lady, is that there was a piece of a skull found on that battlefield, and since it was a skull that firmly puts it into the responsibility of my department.\u0027 He turned to the Librarian. \u0027It\u0027s okay to show her, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 he said. The Librarian shook his head. \u0027Good. That means I can do it, then, under university statute. A certain amount of surreptitious disobedience is demanded of me. We have it set up on an omniscope. Since my colleague is so certain that I should not be doing this, he will not mind if I do. It\u0027s only a very brief fragment of time, but it did impress the Archchancellor, if impress is the right word.\u0027 \u0027I just want to get something clear,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You can actually disobey the orders of someone like the Archchancellor?\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027I am under instruction to do so. It is expected of me.\u0027 \u0027But how can that possibly work?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027What happens when he gives you an instruction that he doesn\u0027t want you to disobey?\u0027 \u0027It works by common sense and good will on all sides,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027If, for example, the Archchancellor gives me a command that absolutely must not be disobeyed, he will add something like, \"Hix, you little worm (by university statute), if you disobey this one, I\u0027ll smack your head.\" Though in reality, a word to the wise, madam, is sufficient. It\u0027s all done on the basis of trust, really. I am trusted to be untrustworthy. I don\u0027t know what the Archchancellor would do without me.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, right,\u0027 said Charlie, grinning. A few minutes later, Glenda was in another dark room, standing in front of a round, dark mirror, at least as high as she was. \u0027Is this going to be like the Moving Pictures?\u0027 she said sarcastically. \u0027An amusing comparison,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027Except for, one, there is no popcorn and, two, you would not want to eat it if there was. What might be called the camera in this case was the last thing one of the human fighters saw.\u0027 \u0027Is this the person whose skull you\u0027ve got?\u0027 \u0027Well done! I see you have been following things,\u0027 said Hix. There was a moment of silence. \u0027This is going to be scary, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027Nightmares? Very probably. Even I think it\u0027s extremely disconcerting. Are you ready, Charlie?\u0027 \u0027Ready,\u0027 said Charlie, from somewhere in the darkness. \u0027Are you sure, miss?\u0027 Glenda wasn\u0027t sure, but anything would be better than facing Hix\u0027s know-it-all smile. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said, keeping her voice firm. \u0027The fragment we are able to show lasts less than three seconds, but I doubt whether you will want to see it again. Are we ready? Thank you, Charlie.\u0027 Glenda\u0027s chair went backwards very quickly and Hix, who had been hovering, caught her. \u0027The only known representation of an orc in battle,\u0027 said Hix, standing her upright. \u0027Well done, by the way. Even the Archchancellor swore out loud.\u0027 Glenda blinked, trying to slice slightly less than three seconds out of her memory. \u0027And that\u0027s true, is it?\u0027 But it had to be true. There was something about the way the image was sticking to the back of her brain that declared the truth of it. \u0027I want to see it again.\u0027 \u0027You what?!\u0027 said Hix. \u0027There\u0027s more to it,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027It\u0027s only a part of a picture.\u0027 \u0027It took us hours to work that out,\u0027 said Hix severely. \u0027How did you spot it the very first go?\u0027 \u0027Because I knew it had to be there,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027She\u0027s got you there, boss,\u0027 said Charlie. \u0027All right. Show it again and this time magnify the right-hand corner. It\u0027s very blurry,\u0027 he said to Glenda. \u0027Can you stop it?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Oh, yes. Charlie has worked that one out.\u0027 \u0027Then you know the bit I mean.\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes.\u0027 \u0027Then show me it again.\u0027 Charlie disappeared behind his curtain. There were a few flashes of light and then... \u0027There!\u0027 She pointed at the frozen image. \u0027That\u0027s men on horseback, isn\u0027t it? And they\u0027ve got whips. I know it\u0027s blurry, but you can tell that they\u0027ve got whips.\u0027 \u0027Well, yes, of course,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027It\u0027s quite hard to get anything to run into a hail of arrows unless you give it some encouragement.\u0027 \u0027They were weapons. Living creatures as weapons. And they don\u0027t look so different from humans.\u0027 \u0027A lot of really interesting stuff happened under the Evil Emperor,\u0027 said Hix, conversationally. \u0027Evil stuff,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Hix, \u0027that was rather the point. Evil Emperor. Evil Empire. It did what it said on the iron maiden.\u0027 \u0027And what happened to them?\u0027 \u0027Well, officially they\u0027re all dead,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027But there have been rumours.\u0027 \u0027And men drove them into battle,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027If you want to put it like that, I suppose so,\u0027 said Hix, \u0027but I\u0027m not certain that changes anything.\u0027 \u0027I think it changes everything,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027It does if all that people talk about are the monsters and not the whips. Things that look very much like people, well, a kind of people. What can you make from people if you really try?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s an interesting theory,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027But I don\u0027t think you can prove it.\u0027 \u0027When Kings fight other Kings and win, they chop off the other King\u0027s head, don\u0027t they?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Sometimes,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027I mean, you can\u0027t blame a weapon for how it\u0027s used. What\u0027s it they say? People can\u0027t help how they were made. I think the orcs were made.\u0027 Glenda glanced at the Librarian, who looked at the ceiling. \u0027You work as a cook, don\u0027t you? Would you like to work for my department?\u0027 \u0027Everyone knows women can\u0027t be wizards,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Ah, yes, but Necro - Post-Mortem Communications is different,\u0027 said Hix proudly. And added, \u0027We could do with some sensible people here, heavens know. And the feminine touch would be very welcome. And don\u0027t think I would require you to just come and do the dusting. We treasure our dust in this place and your cookery skills will be invaluable. After all, basic butchery is all part of the job. And I do believe that Boffo\u0027s shop has a rather good female Necromancer\u0027s costume in their sale, isn\u0027t that right, Charlie?\u0027 \u0027Ten dollars including lace-up bodice. A bargain in anybody\u0027s money,\u0027 said Charlie from behind his curtain. \u0027Very slinky.\u0027 There had been no reply because Glenda\u0027s mouth had stuck in the act of opening, but she finally managed a polite, but firm, \u0027No.\u0027 The head of the Department of Post-Mortem Communications gave a little sigh. \u0027I thought as much, but we are part of the scheme of things. Light and dark. Night and day. Sweet and sour. Good and evil (within acceptable college statutes). It just helps if you can have sensible and reliable people on both sides, but I\u0027m glad that we\u0027ve been able to be of assistance. We don\u0027t see many people down here. Well, not people as such.\u0027 This time Glenda walked along the corridor. \u0027Orc,\u0027 she thought. \u0027A thing that just kills.\u0027 Every time she blinked, the image came back to her. The teeth and claws of a creature in full leap seen, as far as one could tell, by whoever it was it was leaping at. Fighters you couldn\u0027t stop. And Nutt had been killed, according to Trev, and then sort of became unkilled again before going back to Unseen University and eating all the pies. There was an awfully big gap in all this, but men with whips filled it. You can\u0027t have something that just fights, she thought. It has to do other things as well. And Nutt isn\u0027t any stranger than most of the people you see around these days. It\u0027s not a lot to go on, though, but then again, the Evil Emperor was a sorcerer, everyone knew that. Everyone knows you can\u0027t help how you\u0027re made. Well, it\u0027s worth a try. It\u0027s a little bit of uncertainty. As soon as she arrived back outside Nutt\u0027s special place, she sensed that it would be empty. She pushed the door open and there was a definite absence of candles and, more importantly, a very noticeable absence of Nutt. But I told him to go and help them train. That\u0027s where he\u0027s gone, to go and train, definitely, she said to herself. So no need to worry, then. On edge, feeling that something was nevertheless wrong, she forced herself back to the Night Kitchen. She was nearly there when she met Mr Ottomy, his scrawny Adam\u0027s apple as red and glistening as chicken giblets. \u0027So, we\u0027ve got a man-eating orc down here, have we?\u0027 he said. \u0027People aren\u0027t going to stand for that. I heard somewhere that they could go on fighting while their heads are chopped off.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s interesting,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027How did they know which way to go?\u0027 \u0027Ah-ah! They could smell their way,\u0027 said the bledlow. \u0027How could they do that with their heads chopped off? Are you telling me they had a nose up their arse?\u0027 She was shocked at herself for saying that, it was bad language, but Ottomy was bad language made solid. \u0027I don\u0027t hold with it,\u0027 he said, ignoring the question. \u0027You know something else I heard? They were kind of made. When the Evil Emperor wanted fighters he got some of the Igors to turn goblins into orcs. They\u0027re not really proper people at all. I\u0027m going to complain to the Archchancellor.\u0027 \u0027He already knows,\u0027 said Glenda. Well, he must do, she thought. And Vetinari, too, she added to herself. \u0027You\u0027re not going to make trouble for Mister Nutt, are you?\u0027 she said. \u0027Because if you are, Mister Ottomy\u0027�Cshe leaned forward�C\u0027you will never be seen again.\u0027 \u0027You shouldn\u0027t threaten me like that,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027re right, I shouldn\u0027t,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027I should have said that you will never be seen again, you egregious slimy little twerp. Go and tell the Archchancellor if you like and see how much good that does you.\u0027 \u0027They ate people alive!\u0027 said Ottomy. \u0027So did trolls,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Admittedly they spat them out again, but not in much of a state to enjoy life. We used to fight dwarfs once and when they cut you off at the knees they weren\u0027t joking. We know, Mister Ottomy, that the leopard can change his shorts,\u0027 she sniffed, \u0027and it might be a good idea if you did, too. And if I hear of any trouble from you, you will hear from me. Up there it\u0027s the Archchancellor. Down here in the dark, it\u0027s cutlery.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll tell him what you said,\u0027 said the luckless bledlow, backing away. \u0027I would be very grateful if you did,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Now push off.\u0027 Why do we tell one another that the leopard cannot change his shorts? she mused as she watched him scurry away. Has anyone ever seen a leopard wearing shorts? And how would they be able to put them on if they had them? But we go on saying it as if it was some kind of holy truth, when it just means that we\u0027ve run out of an argument. There was something she had to do, now what was it? Oh, yes. She went over once again to the cauldron on which she had chalked \u0027Do Not Touch\u0027 and lifted up the lid. The beady eyes stared up at her from the watery depths and she went away and got a few scraps of fish, which she dropped towards the waiting claws. \u0027Well, I know what to do with you, at least,\u0027 she said. A fully working kitchen holds a great many things, not least of which is a huge collection of ways of committing horrible murder, plus multiple ways of getting rid of the evidence. This wasn\u0027t the first time the thought had crossed her mind. She was quite glad about it. For now, she selected a really thick pair of gloves from a drawer, put her old coat on again, reached into the cauldron and picked up the crab. It snapped at her. She knew it would. Never, ever expect gratitude from those you help. \u0027Tide\u0027s turning,\u0027 she told the crustacean, \u0027so we\u0027re going to take a little walk.\u0027 She dropped it into her shopping bag and headed across the university lawns. A couple of graduate wizards were working in the university boatyard nearby. One looked at her and said, \u0027Are you supposed to be walking on the university lawns, madam?\u0027 \u0027No, it is absolutely forbidden to kitchen staff,\u0027 said Glenda. The students looked at one another. \u0027Oh, right,\u0027 said one of them. And that was it. As easy as that. It was only a metaphorical hammer. It only hit you if you allowed it to be there. She pulled the crab out of her bag and it waved its claws irritably. \u0027See that over there?\u0027 she said, waving her own spare hand. \u0027That\u0027s Hen and Chickens Field.\u0027 It\u0027s doubtful whether the crab\u0027s beady eyes could focus on the grassy waste across the river, but at least she pointed it in the right direction. \u0027People think it\u0027s because there was chickens kept there,\u0027 she went on conversationally while the two wizards looked at one another. \u0027As a matter of fact, that\u0027s not so. It used to be where people were hanged, and so when they walked out from the old gaol that used to be over there, the priest in front of the procession with his billowing robes seemed to lead the line of doomed men and gaolers like a hen leading its chicks. That sort of thing is what we call a droll sense of humour in these parts and I haven\u0027t got the faintest idea why I\u0027m talking to you. I\u0027ve done my best. You now know more than any other crab.\u0027 She walked down to the very edge of what passed for water as the river flowed through the city, and dropped the crab into it. \u0027Stay clear of crab pots and don\u0027t come back.\u0027 She turned round and realized the wizards had been watching her. \u0027Well?\u0027 she snapped. \u0027Is there any law about talking to crabs around here?\u0027 She then gave them a little smile as she walked past. Back in the long corridors she wandered, feeling a little light-headed, towards the vats. Some of its denizens eyed her nervously as she passed through, but there was no sign of Nutt, not that she was looking for him at all. As she walked on towards the Night Kitchen, Trev and Juliet appeared. Glenda couldn\u0027t help but notice that Juliet had a somewhat bright-eyed and ruffled look. That is, she couldn\u0027t help but notice because she made a point of noticing every time. Semi-parental responsibility was a terrible thing. \u0027What are you still doing here?\u0027 she said. They looked at her and there was more in their expressions than mere embarrassment. \u0027I come back to say goodbye to the girls and I \u0027ad to wait for Trev because of the training.\u0027 Glenda sat down. \u0027Make me a cup of tea, will you?\u0027 And because old habits died hard she added, \u0027Boil water in the kettle, two spoons of tea in the pot. Pour water from kettle into pot when it boils. Do not put tea in kettle.\u0027 She turned to Trev. \u0027Where\u0027s Mister Nutt?\u0027 she said, nonchalance booming in her voice. Trev looked down at his feet. \u0027I don\u0027t know, Glenda,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve been - \u0027 \u0027Busy,\u0027 Glenda completed. \u0027But no hanky panky,\u0027 said Juliet quickly. Glenda realized that right now she would not have minded if there had been hanky panky or even spanky. There were things that were important and things that weren\u0027t, and times when you knew the difference. \u0027So, how did Mister Nutt get on, then?\u0027 Trev and Juliet looked at one another. \u0027We don\u0027t know. He wasn\u0027t there,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027We kind of thought \u0027e might be with you,\u0027 said Juliet, handing her a cup of what you get when you ask for a cup of tea from someone who tends to confuse the recipe even at the best of times. \u0027He wasn\u0027t in the Great Hall?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027No, \u0027e wasn\u0027t there - Wait one moment.\u0027 Trev ran down the steps and after a few seconds they heard his footsteps coming back. \u0027His toolbox \u0027as gone,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027I mean, it wasn\u0027t much. He made it outta bits he found in the cellars, but as far as I know it\u0027s all \u0027e owned.\u0027 I knew it, thought Glenda. Of course I knew it. \u0027Where could he be? He\u0027s got nowhere else to go but here,\u0027 she said. \u0027Well, there is that place up in Uberwald he talks about quite a lot,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027That\u0027s getting on for about a thousand miles away,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Well, I suppose he thinks he might as well be there as here,\u0027 said Juliet innocently. \u0027I mean, Orc, I\u0027d want to run away from a name like that if I was me.\u0027 \u0027Look, I\u0027m sure he\u0027s just wandered off somewhere in the building,\u0027 Glenda said, believing absolutely that he hadn\u0027t. But if I believe he\u0027s going to be around the next corner or has just nipped off to... powder his nose, or has just wandered away for half an hour�Cwhich, of course, is his right; perhaps he needs to go and buy a pair of socks?�Cif I keep believing he\u0027ll turn up any minute, he might, even though I know he won\u0027t. She put down the cup. \u0027Half an hour,\u0027 she said. \u0027Juliet, you go and check around the Great Hall. Trev, you go down the tunnels that way. I\u0027ll go down the tunnels this way. If you find anyone you can trust, ask \u0027em.\u0027 A little more than half an hour later, Glenda was the last to turn up back in the Night Kitchen. She very nearly half expected that he would be there and knew that he wouldn\u0027t. \u0027Would he know about getting on a coach?\u0027 she said. \u0027I doubt \u0027e\u0027s ever seen one,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027You know what I would do if I was \u0027im? I\u0027d just run. It was like when Dad died, I spent all night walkin\u0027 around the city. I wasn\u0027t bothered where I went. Just went. Wanted to run away from bein\u0027 me.\u0027 \u0027How fast can an orc run?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Much faster than a man, I bet,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027An\u0027 for a long time, too.\u0027 \u0027Listen.\u0027 This was Juliet. \u0027Can\u0027t you \u0027ear it?\u0027 \u0027Hear what?\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027Well?\u0027 \u0027What happened to Awk! Awk!?\u0027 \u0027I think we\u0027ll find them where we find him,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Well, he can\u0027t run all the way back to Uberwald,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027You couldn\u0027t.\u0027 At last Glenda said it: \u0027I think we should go after him.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll come,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Then I\u0027m goin\u0027 to come, too,\u0027 insisted Juliet. \u0027Besides, I\u0027ve still got the money and you\u0027re goin\u0027 to need it.\u0027 \u0027Your money\u0027s in the bank,\u0027 said Glenda, \u0027and the bank is shut. But I think I\u0027ve got a few dollars in my purse.\u0027 \u0027Then, excuse me,\u0027 said Trev, \u0027I won\u0027t be a moment. I think there\u0027s somethin\u0027 we ought to take... \u0027 The driver of the horse bus to Sto Lat looked down and said, \u0027Two dollars fifty pence each.\u0027 \u0027But you only go to Sto Lat,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the man calmly. \u0027That\u0027s why it says Sto Lat on the front.\u0027 \u0027We might \u0027ave to go a lot further,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Just about every coach in this part of the world goes through Sto Lat,\u0027 he said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-14.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about football—the most important thing about football—is that it is never just about football.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
