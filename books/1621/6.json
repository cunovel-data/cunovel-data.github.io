{"id":94956,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u0027And it was a Dimmer boy?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027They heard he died, but you know how those Dimwell buggers lie.\u0027 \u0027Where are your boys now?\u0027 For a moment the old man\u0027s eyes blazed. \u0027They\u0027re stoppin\u0027 indoors or I\u0027ll thrash \u0027em. You get some nasty gangs out when something like that\u0027s been happening.\u0027 \u0027One less now, then,\u0027 said Glenda. Stollop\u0027s face was painted in pigments of misery and dread. \u0027They\u0027re not bad boys, you know. Not at heart. People pick on them.\u0027 Yes, down at the Watch House, she said to herself, where people say, \u0027That\u0027s them! The big ones! I\u0027d know them anywhere!\u0027 She left him shaking his head and ran down the road. The troll would never expect to get a fare up here and there was no sense in hanging around and getting covered in paint. She might just about be able to catch up with it on its way down town. After a minute or two she realized that someone was following her. Chasing her in the gloom. If only she\u0027d remembered to bring the knife. She stepped into a patch of deeper shadow and, as the knife-wielding maniac drew level, stepped out and shouted, \u0027Stop following me!\u0027 Juliet gave a little scream. \u0027They\u0027ve got Trev,\u0027 she sobbed, as Glenda held her. \u0027I know they have!\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be silly,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027There\u0027s fighting all the time after a big match. No sense in getting too worried.\u0027 \u0027So why were you running?\u0027 said Juliet sharply. And there was no answer to that. The bledlow nodded him through the staff door with a grunt and he headed straight away for the vats. A couple of the lads were dribbling in their meticulous and very slow way, but there was no sign of Nutt until Trev risked his sanity and nasal passages by checking the communal sleeping area, where he found Nutt sleeping on his bedroll, clutching his stomach. It was an extremely large stomach. Given the usual neat shape of Nutt, it made him look a little like a snake that had swallowed an extremely large goat. The curious face of the Igor and his worried voice came back to him. He looked down beside the bedroll and saw a small piece of piecrust and some crumbs. It smelled like a very good pie. In fact, he could think of only one person who could ever make a pie quite so beguiling. Whatever it was that had been filling Trev, the invisible illumination that had made him almost dance here from the Watch House, drained out through his feet. He headed through the stone corridors to the Night Kitchen. Any optimism he might have retained was dashed one hope at a time by the trail of pie crumbs, but the illumination rose again as he saw Juliet and, oh yes, Glenda, standing in what was left of the Night Kitchen, which was a mess of torn-open cupboards and pieces of piecrust. \u0027Oh, Mister Trevor Likely,\u0027 said Glenda, folding her arms. \u0027Just one question: who ate all the pies?\u0027 The illumination swelled until it filled Trev with a kind of silvery light. It had been three nights since he had slept in an actual bed and it had not been your normal sort of day. He smiled broadly at nothing at all and was caught by Juliet as he hit the ground. Trev woke up half an hour later, when Glenda brought him a cup of tea. \u0027I thought we\u0027d better let you sleep,\u0027 she said. \u0027Juliet said you looked awful, so obviously she\u0027s coming to her senses.\u0027 \u0027He was dead,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Dead as a doorknob, and then he wasn\u0027t. What\u0027s that all about?\u0027 He levered himself up and realized that he had been put to bed on one of the grubby bedrolls in the vats. Nutt was lying on the roll next to him. \u0027All right,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027If you can do it without lying, tell me.\u0027 She sat down and watched the sleeping Nutt for a while as Trev tried to make sense of the previous evening. \u0027What was in the sandwich again? The one the Igor gave him?\u0027 \u0027Tuna, spaghetti and jam. With sprinkles,\u0027 said Trev, yawning. \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not the kinda thing you forget.\u0027 \u0027What kind of jam?\u0027 Glenda insisted. \u0027Why ask?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m thinking it might work with quince. Or chilli. Can\u0027t see any place for sprinkles, though. They don\u0027t make any sense.\u0027 \u0027What? He\u0027s an Igor. It doesn\u0027t have to make sense!\u0027 \u0027But he warned you about Nutt?\u0027 \u0027Yes, but I don\u0027t think he meant \"lock up your pies\", do you? Are you gonna get into trouble about the pies?\u0027 \u0027No. I\u0027ve got plenty more maturing in the cool room. They\u0027re at their best when matured. You have to keep ahead of yourself, with pies.\u0027 She looked down at Nutt and went on, \u0027Are you really telling me he got all smashed up by the Stollop boys and then walked out of the Lady Sibyl?\u0027 \u0027He was as dead as a doorknob. Even old \u0027addock could spot that.\u0027 This time they both stared at Nutt. \u0027He\u0027s alive now,\u0027 said Glenda, as if it was an accusation. \u0027Look,\u0027 said Trev, \u0027all I know about people who come from Uberwald is that some of them are vampires and some are werewolves. Well, I don\u0027t think vampires are much interested in pies. And it was a full moon last week and he didn\u0027t act odd; well, odder than normal.\u0027 Glenda lowered her voice. \u0027Maybe he\u0027s a zombie - No, they don\u0027t eat pies either.\u0027 She continued to stare at Nutt, but another part of her said, \u0027There\u0027s going to be a banquet on Wednesday night. Lord Vetinari\u0027s up to something with the wizards. It\u0027s about the football, I\u0027m sure of it.\u0027 \u0027Well?\u0027 \u0027For some plan, I expect. Something nasty. The wizards were at the game today taking notes! Don\u0027t tell me that\u0027s healthy. They want to shut down football, that\u0027s what it is!\u0027 \u0027Good!\u0027 \u0027Trevor Likely, how can you say that! Your dad - \u0027 \u0027Died because he was dumb,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027And don\u0027t tell me it was the way he would have wanted to go. No one would want to go like that.\u0027 \u0027But he loved his football!\u0027 \u0027So? What does that mean? The Stollop boys love their football. Andy Shank loves \u0027is football! And what does it mean? Not countin\u0027 today, how often have you seen the ball in play? Hardly ever, I bet.\u0027 \u0027Well, yes, but it\u0027s not about the football.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re saying that football is not about football?\u0027 Glenda wished she\u0027d had a proper education, or, failing that, any real education at all. But she was not going to back off now. \u0027It\u0027s the sharing,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s being part of the crowd. It\u0027s chanting together. It\u0027s all of it. The whole thing.\u0027 \u0027I believe, Miss Glenda,\u0027 said Nutt from his mattress, \u0027that the work you are looking for is Trousenblert\u0027s Der Selbst uberschritten durch das Ganze.\u0027 They looked down at Nutt again, mouths open. He had opened his eyes and appeared to be staring at the ceiling. \u0027It is the lonely soul trying to reach out to the shared soul of all humanity, and possibly much further. W. E. G. Goodnight\u0027s translation of In Search of The Whole is marred, while quite understandable, by the mistranslation of bewu?tseinsschwelle as \"haircut\" throughout.\u0027 Trev and Glenda looked at one another. Trev shrugged. Where could they start? Glenda coughed. \u0027Mister Nutt, are you alive or dead or what?\u0027 \u0027Alive, thank you very much for asking.\u0027 \u0027I saw you killed!\u0027 Trev shouted. \u0027We ran all the way to the Lady Sybil!\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I am sorry, I do not recall. It would seem that diagnosis was in error. Am I right?\u0027 They exchanged glances. Trev got the worst of it. When Glenda was angry, her glance might just possibly etch glass. But Nutt had a point. It was hard to argue with a man who insisted that he was not dead. \u0027Um, and then you came back here and ate nine pies,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Looks like they did you good,\u0027 said Trev, with brittle cheerfulness. \u0027But I can\u0027t see where they\u0027ve gone,\u0027 Glenda finished. \u0027Belly-busters, every one of them.\u0027 \u0027You will be angry with me.\u0027 Nutt looked frightened. \u0027Let\u0027s all calm down, shall we?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Look, I was pretty worried, my oath, yes. Not angry, okay? We\u0027re your friends.\u0027 \u0027I must be becoming. I must be helpful!\u0027 This came from Nutt\u0027s lips like a mantra. Glenda took his hands. \u0027Look, I\u0027m not bothered about the pies, really I\u0027m not. I like to see a man with a good appetite. But you must tell us what\u0027s wrong. Have you done something you shouldn\u0027t?\u0027 \u0027I should be making myself worthy,\u0027 Nutt said, pulling away gently and not meeting her eyes. \u0027I must be becoming. I must not lie. I must gain worth. Thank you for your kindness.\u0027 He got up, walked down the length of the vats, picked up a basket of candles, came back, wound up his dribbling machine and began to work, oblivious of their presence. \u0027Do you know what goes on in his head?\u0027 Glenda whispered. \u0027When he was young, he was chained to an anvil for seven years,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027What? That\u0027s terrible! Someone must have been very cruel to do something like that!\u0027 \u0027Or desperate to make sure he didn\u0027t get free.\u0027 \u0027Things are never all they seem, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt, without looking up from his feverish activity, \u0027and the acoustics in these cellars are very good. Your father loved you, did he not?\u0027 \u0027Wot?\u0027 Trev\u0027s face reddened. \u0027He loved you, took you to the football, shared a pie with you, taught you to cheer for the Dimmers? Did he hold you on his shoulders so that you could see more of the game?\u0027 \u0027Stop talkin\u0027 about my dad like that!\u0027 Glenda took Trev\u0027s arm. \u0027It\u0027s okay, Trev, it\u0027s all right, it\u0027s not a nasty question, really it isn\u0027t!\u0027 \u0027But you hate him, because he became a mortal man, dying on the cobbles,\u0027 said Nutt, picking up another undribbled candle. \u0027That is nasty,\u0027 said Glenda. Nutt ignored her. \u0027He let you down, Mister Trev. He wasn\u0027t the small boy\u0027s god. It turned out that he was only a man. But he was not only a man. Everyone who has ever watched a game in this city has heard of Dave Likely. If he was a fool, then any man who has ever climbed a mountain or swum a torrent is a fool. If he was a fool then so was the man who first tried to tame fire. If he was a fool then so was the man who tried the first oyster, he was a fool, too�Calthough I\u0027m bound to remark that, given the division of labour in early hunter-gatherer cultures, he was probably a woman as well. Perhaps only a fool gets out of bed. But, after death, some fools shine like stars, and your father is such a one. After death, people forget the foolishness, but they do remember the shine. You could not have done anything. You could not have stopped him. If you could have stopped him he would not have been Dave Likely, a name that means football to thousands of people.\u0027 Nutt very carefully put down a beautifully dribbled candle and continued. \u0027Think about this, Mister Trev. Don\u0027t be smart. Smart is only a polished version of dumb. Try intelligence. It will surely see you through.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s just a load of words!\u0027 said Trev hotly, but Glenda saw the glistening lines down his cheeks. \u0027Please think about them, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt and added, \u0027There, I have done a complete basket. That is worth.\u0027 It was the calmness. Nutt had been spinning, almost sick with anxiety. He\u0027d been repeating himself, as if he\u0027d had to learn things for a teacher. And then he was otherwise�Ctotally reserved and collected. Glenda looked from Trev to Nutt and back again. Trev\u0027s mouth hung open. She didn\u0027t blame it. What Nutt had said with quiet matter-of-factness had sounded like not an opinion but the truth, winched out of some deep well. Then Trev broke the silence, speaking as if hypnotized, his voice hoarse. \u0027He gave me his old jersey when I was five. It was like a tent. I mean, it was so greasy I never got wet - \u0027 He stopped. After a moment Glenda pushed at his elbow. \u0027He\u0027s gone all stiff,\u0027 she said, \u0027as stiff as a piece of wood.\u0027 \u0027Ah, catatonic,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027He is overwhelmed by his feelings. We should lay him down.\u0027 \u0027These old mattresses they sleep on in here are rubbish!\u0027 said Glenda, looking around for a better alternative to cold flagstones. \u0027I know the very thing!\u0027 said Nutt, suddenly all action and plunging off down the passage. This left Glenda still holding a rigid Trev when Juliet appeared from the direction of the kitchens. She stopped instantly when she saw them, and burst into tears. \u0027He\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 \u0027Er, no - \u0027 Glenda began. \u0027I talked to some of the bakery lads coming in to work and they\u0027re telling me there\u0027s been fights all over the city and someone got himself murdered!\u0027 \u0027Trev\u0027s just had a bit of a shock, that\u0027s all. Mister Nutt\u0027s gone to find something for him to lie down on.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 Juliet sounded a little disappointed, presumably because \u0027a bit of a shock\u0027 was not sufficiently dramatic, but she rallied just as a loud, rough and uniquely wooden noise from the other direction heralded Nutt pushing a large couch, which shuddered to a halt in front of them. \u0027There\u0027s a big room piled up with old furniture up the hall,\u0027 he said, patting the faded velvet. \u0027It\u0027s a bit musty, but I think all the mice have fallen out on the way here. Quite a find actually. I believe it is a chaise longue from the workshop of the famous Gurning Upspire. I think I can probably restore it later. Let him down gently.\u0027 \u0027What happened to him?\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027Oh, the truth can be a little bit upsetting,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027But he will get over it and feel better.\u0027 \u0027I would very much like to know the truth myself, Mister Nutt, thank you very much,\u0027 said Glenda, folding her arms and trying to look stern while all the time a voice in her head was whispering Chaise longue! Chaise longue! When no one else is here you can have a go at languishing! \u0027It\u0027s a kind of medicine with words,\u0027 said Nutt, carefully. \u0027Sometimes people fool themselves into believing things that aren\u0027t true. Sometimes that can be quite dangerous for the person. They see the world in a wrong way. They won\u0027t let themselves see that what they believe is wrong. But often there is a part of the mind that does know, and the right words can let it out.\u0027 He gave them a worried look. \u0027Well, that\u0027s nice,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027It sounds like hocus pocus to me,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Folk know their own minds!\u0027 She folded her arms again, and saw Nutt glance at them. \u0027Well?\u0027 she demanded. \u0027Haven\u0027t you ever seen elbows before?\u0027 \u0027Never such pretty dimpled ones, Miss Glenda, on such tightly folded arms.\u0027 Up until that point Glenda had never realized that Juliet had such a dirty laugh, to which, Glenda fervently hoped, she was not entitled. \u0027Glenda\u0027s got a bee-oh! Glenda\u0027s got a bee-ooh!\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s \"beau\", actually,\u0027 Glenda said, swiping to the back of her mind the recollection that it had taken her years to find that out herself. \u0027And I was just helping. We\u0027re helping him, aren\u0027t we, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t he look sweet lying there?\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027All pink.\u0027 She stroked Trev\u0027s greasy hair inexpertly. \u0027Just like a little boy!\u0027 \u0027Yes, he\u0027s always been good at that,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Why don\u0027t you go and get the little boy a cup of tea? And a biscuit. Not one of the chocolate ones. That\u0027ll take some time,\u0027 she said as the girl shimmied away. \u0027She tends to get distracted. Her mind wanders and amuses itself elsewhere.\u0027 \u0027Trev tells me that despite your more mature appearance you are the same age as her,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027You really don\u0027t talk to many ladies, do you, Mister Nutt?\u0027 \u0027Oh dear, have I made another faux pas?\u0027 said Nutt, suddenly all nerves again, to such an extent that she took pity on him. \u0027Would this be \"faux pas\" that looks as if it should be said like \"forks pass\"?\u0027 \u0027Er, yes.\u0027 Glenda nodded, satisfied, another literary puzzle solved. \u0027Better not use the word \"mature\" unless you are talking about cheese or wine. Not good to use it for ladies.\u0027 She stared at him, wondering how to pose the next question. She opted for directness; she wasn\u0027t very good at anything else. \u0027Trev is sure you sort of died and came alive again.\u0027 \u0027So I understand.\u0027 \u0027Not many people do that.\u0027 \u0027The vast majority do not, I believe.\u0027 \u0027How did you do it?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027This is rather late in the day, I must admit, but you don\u0027t feel any hunger for blood or brains, do you?\u0027 \u0027Not at all. Just pies. I like pies. I am very ashamed about the pies. It will not happen again, Miss Glenda. I fear my body was acting on its own. It needed instant nourishment.\u0027 \u0027Trev says you used to be chained to an anvil?\u0027 \u0027Yes. That was because I was worthless. Then I was taken to see Ladyship and she told me: You are worthless but, I think, not unworthy, and I will give you worth.\u0027 \u0027But you must have had parents!\u0027 \u0027I do not know. There are many things I don\u0027t know. There is a door.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027A door in my head. Some things are behind the door and I don\u0027t know them. But that is all right, Ladyship says.\u0027 Glenda felt like giving up. Nutt answered questions, yes, but really all you ended up with was more questions. But she persevered. It was like stabbing away at a tin can, hoping to find a way in. \u0027Ladyship is a real lady, is she? Castles and servants and whatnot?\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes. Even a whatnot. She is my friend. And she is mature like cheese and wine, because she has lived for a long time and is not old.\u0027 \u0027But she sent you here, yes? Did she teach you... whatever it was you used on Trev?\u0027 Beside Glenda, Trev stirred. \u0027No,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I read the works of the masters in the library all by myself. But she did tell me that people, too, were a kind of living book, and I would have to learn to read them.\u0027 \u0027Well, you read Trev well enough. Be told, though: don\u0027t try that stuff on me or you\u0027ll never see another pie!\u0027 \u0027Yes, Miss Glenda. Sorry, Miss Glenda.\u0027 She sighed. What is it about me? The moment they look downcast I feel sorry for them! She looked up. He was watching her. \u0027Stop that!\u0027 \u0027Sorry, Miss Glenda.\u0027 \u0027But you got to see the football, at least. Did you enjoy it?\u0027 Nutt\u0027s face lit up. \u0027Yes. It was wonderful. The noise, the crowds, the chanting, oh the chanting! It becomes a second blood! The unison! To not be alone! To be not just one but one and all, of one mind and purpose!... excuse me.\u0027 He had seen her face. \u0027So you quite liked it, then,\u0027 said Glenda. The intensity of Nutt\u0027s outburst had been like opening an oven door. It was a mercy her hair hadn\u0027t frizzled. \u0027Oh yes! The ambience was wonderful!\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t try those,\u0027 Glenda hazarded, \u0027but the pease pudding is usually good.\u0027 The scrape of crockery and the tinkling of a teaspoon heralded the arrival of Juliet, or rather of the cup of tea that she was holding in front of her as if it were a grail, so that she drifted along behind it like a comet\u0027s tail. Glenda was impressed. The tea was in the cup instead of in the saucer and it was the acceptable brown colour that is usually characteristic of tea and was usually the only tea-like characteristic of tea made by Juliet. Trev sat up, and Glenda wondered how long he might have been paying attention. All right, he might be good in an emergency, and at least he washed sometimes and owned a toothbrush, but Juliet was special, wasn\u0027t she? All she needed was a prince. Technically that meant Lord Vetinari, but he was far too old. Besides, no one was sure which side of the bed he got out of, or even if he went to bed at all. But one day a prince would come, even if Glenda had to drag him on a chain. She turned her head. Nutt was watching her intently again. Well, her book was locked down tightly. No one was going to riffle through her pages. And tomorrow she would find out what the wizards were up to. That was easy. She\u0027d be invisible. In the stillness of the night, Nutt sat in his special place, which was yet another room, very close to the vats. Candles burned as he sat at a rescued table, staring at a piece of paper and absent-mindedly cleaning out his ear with the point of his pencil. Nutt was technically an expert on love poetry throughout the ages and had discussed it at length with Miss Healstether, the castle librarian. He had also tried to discuss it with Ladyship, but she had laughed and said it was frivolity, although quite helpful as a tutorial on the use of vocabulary, scansion, rhythm and affect as a means to an end, to wit getting a young lady to take all her clothes off. At that particular point, Nutt had not really understood what she meant. It sounded like some sort of conjuring trick. He tapped the pencil on the page. The castle library had been full of poetry and he\u0027d read it avidly as he read all books, not knowing why it had been written or what exactly it was supposed to achieve. But generally poems written by men to women followed a very similar format. Now, with a world\u0027s worth of the finest poetry to choose from, he was lost for words. Then he nodded to himself. Ah, yes, Robert Scandal\u0027s famous poem, \u0027Oi! To his Deaf Mistress\u0027. It surely had the right shape and tempo. Of course, there had to be a muse. Oh, yes, all poetry needed a muse. That might present a difficulty. Juliet, while quite attractive, was also, in his mind, a kind of amiable ghost. Hmm. Ah, of course... Nutt pulled the pencil out of his ear, hesitated and wrote: I sing, but not of love, for love is blind, but celebrate instead the muse of kindness... The fires in the vats cooled, but Nutt\u0027s brain was suddenly ablaze. Round about midnight, Glenda decided it was safe enough to leave the boys alone to get up to whatever it was boys got up to when women weren\u0027t around to look after them, and made sure that she and Juliet were on the late cross-town bus. That meant she actually got to sleep in her own bed. She looked around the tiny bedroom by candlelight and met the gaze, which was quite difficult, of Mr Wobble, the three-eyed transcendental teddy bear. It would have been nice to have a bit of cosmic explanation at this point, but the universe never gave you explanations, it just gave you more questions. She reached down surreptitiously, even though there was only a three-eyed teddy bear watching her, and picked up the latest Iradne Comb-Buttworthy from the cache unsuccessfully hidden below. After ten minutes of reading, which took her some way into the book (Ms Comb-Buttworthy producing volumes that were even slimmer than her heroines), she experienced d��j�� vu. Moreover, the d��j�� vu was squared, because she had the feeling of having had the d��j�� vu before. \u0027They\u0027re really all the same, aren\u0027t they?\u0027 she said to the three-eyed teddy bear. \u0027You know it\u0027s going to be Mary the Maid, or someone like her, and there\u0027s got to be two men and she will end up with the nice one, and there has to be misunderstandings, and they never do anything more than kiss and it\u0027s absolutely guaranteed that, for example, an exciting civil war or an invasion by trolls or even a scene with any cooking in it is not going to happen. The best you can expect is a thunderstorm.\u0027 It really had nothing to do with real life at all, which, although short on civil wars and invasions by trolls, at least had the decency to have lots of cooking. The book dropped out of her fingers and thirty seconds later she was sound asleep. Surprisingly, no neighbour needed her in the night so she got up, dressed and breakfasted in what was an almost unfamiliar world. She opened her door to take breakfast to widow Crowdy and found Juliet on the doorstep. The girl took a step back. \u0027Are you goin\u0027 out, Glendy? It\u0027s early!\u0027 \u0027Well, you\u0027re up,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And with a newspaper, I\u0027m pleased to see.\u0027 \u0027Isn\u0027t it exciting?\u0027 said Juliet, and thrust the paper at her. Glenda took one look at the picture on the front page, took a second, closer look, and then grabbed Juliet and pulled her inside. \u0027You can see their tonkers,\u0027 Juliet observed, in a voice that was much too matter-of-fact for Glenda\u0027s liking. \u0027You shouldn\u0027t know what they look like!\u0027 she said, smacking the paper down on her kitchen table. \u0027What? I\u0027ve got three brothers, ain\u0027t I? Everyone bathes in a tub in front of the fire, don\u0027t they? It\u0027s not like they\u0027re anything special. Anyway, it\u0027s culture, all right? Remember when you took me to that place full of people in the nuddy. You stayed in there hours.\u0027 \u0027It was the Royal Art Museum,\u0027 said Glenda, thanking her stars that they were indoors. \u0027That\u0027s different!\u0027 She tried to read the story, but it was very difficult with that amazing picture beside it, just where an eye might stray again and again. Glenda enjoyed her job. She didn\u0027t have a career; they were for people who could not hold down jobs. She was very good at what she did, so she did it all the time, without paying much attention to the world. But now her eyes were opened. In fact, it was time to blink. Under the headline \u0027New Light on Ancient Game\u0027 was a picture of a vase or, rather more grandly, an urn, in orange and black. It showed some very tall and skinny men�Ctheir masculinity was beyond doubt, but possibly beyond belief. They were apparently struggling for possession of a ball; one of them was lying on the ground, and looked as if he was in some pain. The translation of the name of the urn was, said the caption, THE TACKLE. According to the accompanying story, someone at the Royal Art Museum had found the urn in an old storeroom, and it contained scrolls which, it said here, had the original rules of foot-the-ball laid down in the early years of the century of the Summer Weevil, a thousand years ago, when the game was played in honour of the goddess Pedestriana... Glenda skimmed through the rest of it, because there was a lot of rest to skim. An artist\u0027s impression of the aforesaid goddess adorned page three. She was, of course, beautiful. You seldom saw a goddess portrayed as ugly. This probably had something to do with their ability to strike people down instantly. In Pedestriana\u0027s case, she would probably have gone for the feet. Glenda put the paper down, seething with anger, and as a cook she knew how to seethe. This wasn\u0027t football�Cexcept that the Guild of Historians said that it was, and could prove it not only with old parchments but also with an urn, and she could see that you were on the wrong end of an argument if you were up against an urn. But it was too neat, wasn\u0027t it? Except... why? His lordship didn\u0027t like football, but here was an article saying that this game was very old and had its own goddess, and if there were two things this city liked, it was tradition and goddesses, especially if the goddesses were a bit short on the chiffon above the waist. Did his lordship let them put anything in the paper? What was going on? \u0027I\u0027ve got business to attend to,\u0027 she said sternly. \u0027It\u0027s good that you bought a decent paper, but you don\u0027t want to read this kind of stuff.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t. Who\u0027s interested in that? I got it for the advert. Look.\u0027 Glenda had never bothered much about the adverts in the paper, because they were put there by people who were after your money. But there it was, right there. Madame Sharn of Bonk gives you... micromail. \u0027You said we could go,\u0027 said Juliet pointedly. \u0027Yes, well, that was before - \u0027 \u0027You said we could go.\u0027 \u0027Yes. But, well, has anyone from the Sisters ever gone to a fashion show? It\u0027s not our kind of thing, is it?\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t say that in the paper. Says admission free. You said we could go!\u0027 Two o\u0027clock, thought Glenda. Suppose I could manage it... \u0027All right, meet at work at half past one, do you hear? Not a minute later! I\u0027ve got things to do.\u0027 The University Council meets every day at half past eleven, she thought to herself. Oh, to be a fly on that wall. She grinned... Trev was sitting in the battered old chair that served as his office in the vats. Work was proceeding at its usual reliable snail\u0027s pace. \u0027Ah, I see you are in early, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027I am sorry not to have been here. I had to go and deal with an emergency candelabra upset.\u0027 He leaned closer. \u0027I have done what you asked, Mister Trev.\u0027 Trev snapped out of his daydream of Juliet and said, \u0027Huh?\u0027 \u0027You asked me to write... to improve your poem for Miss Juliet.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve done it?\u0027 \u0027Perhaps you would like to have a look, Mister Trev?\u0027 He handed the paper to Trev and stood nervously by the chair as a pupil stands by the teacher. After a very short while Trev\u0027s forehead wrinkled. \u0027What\u0027s ee-er?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s \"e\u0027er\", sir, as in \"where e\u0027er she walks\".\u0027 \u0027You mean, like, she walks on air?\u0027 said Trev. \u0027No, Mister Trev. I should just put it down to poetry if I were you.\u0027 Trev struggled on. He had never had much to do with poetry, except the sort that started \u0027There was a young lady of Quirm\u0027, but this looked like the real stuff. The page seemed to be crowded and yet full of space as well. Also, the writing was extremely curly and that was a sure sign, wasn\u0027t it? You didn\u0027t get that sort of thing from the lady of Quirm. \u0027This is great stuff, Mister Nutt. This is really great stuff. This is poetry, but what really is it sayin\u0027?\u0027 Nutt cleared his throat. \u0027Well, sir, the essence of poetry of this nature is to create a mood that will make the recipient, that is to say, sir, the young lady who you are going to send it to, feel very kindly disposed to the author of the poem, which would be you, sir, in this case. According to Ladyship, everything else is just showing off. I have brought you a pen and an envelope; if you would kindly sign the poem I will ensure that it gets to Miss Juliet.\u0027 \u0027I bet no one\u0027s ever written her a poem before,\u0027 said Trev, skating quickly over the truth that he hadn\u0027t either. \u0027I\u0027d love to be there when she reads it.\u0027 \u0027That would not be advised,\u0027 said Nutt quickly. \u0027The general consensus is that the lady concerned reads it in the absence of the hopeful swain, that is you, sir, and forms a beneficent mental picture of him. Your actual presence might actually get in the way, especially since I see you haven\u0027t changed your shirt again today. Besides, I am informed that there is a possibility that all her clothes will fall off.\u0027 Trev, who had been struggling with the concept of \u0027swain\u0027, fast-forwarded to this information at speed. \u0027Er, say that again?\u0027 \u0027All her clothes might fall off. I am sorry about this, but it appears to be a by-product of the whole business of poetry. But broadly speaking, sir, it carries the message you have asked for, which is to say \"I think you\u0027re really fit. I really fancy you. Can we have a date? No hanky panky, I promise.\" However, sir, since it is a love poem, I have taken the liberty of altering it slightly to carry the suggestion that if hanky or panky should appear to be welcomed by the young lady she will not find you wanting in either department.\u0027 Archchancellor Ridcully rubbed his hands together. \u0027Well, gentlemen, I hope we have all seen the papers this morning, or glanced at them at any rate?\u0027 \u0027I thought that the front page was not the place,\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes. \u0027It quite put me off my breakfast. Metaphorically speaking, of course.\u0027 \u0027Apparently, the urn has been in the museum\u0027s cellars for at least three hundred years, but for some reason it makes its presence felt now,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Of course, they have tons of stuff in there that\u0027s never really been looked at properly and the city was going through a prudish period then and didn\u0027t care to know about that sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027What, that men have tonkers?\u0027 said Dr Hix. \u0027That sort of news gets out sooner or later.\u0027 He looked around at the disapproving faces and added, \u0027Skull ring, remember? Under college statute the head of the Department of Post-Mortem Communications is entitled, nay, required to make tasteless, divisive and moderately evil remarks. I\u0027m sorry, but these are your rules.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, Doctor Hix. Your uncalled-for remarks are duly noted and appreciated.\u0027 \u0027You know, it seems very suspicious to me that this wretched urn has turned up at just this time,\u0027 observed the Senior Wrangler, \u0027and I hope I am not alone in this?\u0027 \u0027I know what you mean,\u0027 said Hix. \u0027If I didn\u0027t know that the Archchancellor had his work cut out to persuade Vetinari to let us play, I would think that this was some sort of plan.\u0027 \u0027Ye-ess,\u0027 said Ridcully thoughtfully. \u0027The old rules look a lot more interesting, sir,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Ye-ess.\u0027 \u0027Did you read the bit that said players were not allowed to use their hands, sir? And the high priest takes to the field of play to ensure that the rules are honoured?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t see that catching on these days,\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes. \u0027He\u0027s armed with a poisoned dagger, sir,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Ah? Well, that should make for a more interesting game, at least, eh, Mustrum?... Mustrum?\u0027 \u0027What? Oh, yes. Yes. Something to think about, indeed. Yes, indeed. One man, in charge... The onlooker who sees most of the game... the gamer, in fact... So what move have I missed?\u0027 \u0027Sorry, Archchancellor?\u0027 Ridcully blinked at Ponder Stibbons. \u0027What? Oh, just composing my thoughts, as one does.\u0027 He sat up straight. \u0027In any case the rules don\u0027t concern us at this point. We have to play this game in any eventuality and so we will abide by them in the best traditions of sportsmanship until we have worked out where they may be most usefully broken to our advantage. Mister Stibbons, you are collating our studies of the game. The floor is yours.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, Archchancellor.\u0027 Ponder cleared his throat. \u0027Gentlemen, the game of football is clearly about more than the rules and the nature of the play. In any case, these are pure mechanical considerations; the chanting and, of course, the food are of more concern to us, I feel. They seem to be an integral part of the game. Regrettably, so do the supporters\u0027 clubs.\u0027 \u0027What is the nature of this problem?\u0027 Ridcully enquired. \u0027They hit one another over the head with them. It would be true to say that brawling and mindless violence, such as occurred yesterday afternoon, is one of the cornerstones of the sport.\u0027 \u0027A far cry from its ancient beginnings, then,\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies, shaking his head. \u0027Well, yes. I understand that in those days the losing team was throttled. However, I suppose this would be called mindful violence that took place with the enthusiastic consent of the entire community, or at least that part of it that was still capable of breath. Fortunately, we do not yet have supporters, so that this is not at present our problem, and I propose we go directly to the pies.\u0027 There was a chorus of general agreement from the wizards. Food was their cup of tea, and if possible slice of cake too. Some of them were already watching the door in anticipation of the tea trolley. It seemed like an age since nine. \u0027Central to the game is the pie,\u0027 Ponder went on, \u0027which is generally of shortcrust pastry containing appropriate pie-like substances. I collected half a dozen and tested them on the usual subjects.\u0027 \u0027The students?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Yes. They said they were pretty awful. Not a patch on the pies here, they said. They finished them off, however. Examination of the ingredients suggests that they consisted of gravy, fat and salt, and insofar as it was possible to tell, none of the students appears to have died... \u0027 \u0027So we are ahead on pies, then,\u0027 said Ridcully cheerfully. \u0027I suppose so, Archchancellor, although I do not believe that the pie quality plays any role - \u0027 He stopped, because the door had swung open to allow the ingress of a reinforced, heavy-duty tea trolley. Since it was not being propelled by Her, the wizards paid no further attention and settled down to the passing of cups, the handing round of the sugar bowl, the inspection of the quality of the chocolate biscuits with a view to taking more than one\u0027s entitlement and all the other little diversions without which a committee would be a clever device for making worthwhile decisions quickly. When the rattling had ceased, and the last biscuit had been fought for, Ridcully tinkled his teaspoon on the rim of his cup for silence, although since he was Ridcully this only added the crash of broken crockery to the hubbub. Once the girl in charge of the trolley had sponged everybody down, he continued: \u0027The chanting, gentlemen, appears to be another inconsequentiality at first sight, but I have reason to believe that it has a certain power, and we will ignore it at our peril. I see the museum\u0027s translators say the modern chants were originally hymns to the goddess calling on her to grant her favours to the team of choice, while naiads danced on the edges of the field of play, the better to encourage the players to greater feats of prowess.\u0027 \u0027Naiads?\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. \u0027They\u0027re water nymphs, aren\u0027t they? Young women with very thin damp clothing? Why would anyone want them around? Besides, didn\u0027t they drown sailors by singing to them?\u0027 Ridcully let the thoughtful pause hang in the air for a while before volunteering: \u0027Fortunately, I don\u0027t think anyone these days would expect that we play football underwater.\u0027 \u0027The pies would float,\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies. \u0027Not necessarily,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027What about clothing, Mister Stibbons? I assume there will be some?\u0027 \u0027Temperatures were somewhat warmer in olden days. I can assure you that no one will insist on nudity.\u0027 Ponder might have noticed the rattle as the girl with the tea trolley almost dropped a cup, but was gracious enough not to notice that he had noticed. He went on. \u0027Currently the teams wear old shirts and short trousers.\u0027 \u0027How short?\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies, urgency in his voice. \u0027About mid-knee, I believe,\u0027 said Ponder. \u0027Is this likely to be a problem?\u0027 \u0027Yes, it is. The knees should be covered. It is a well-known fact that a glimpse of the male knee can drive women into a frenzy of libidinousness.\u0027 There was another rattle from the tea trolley, but Ponder ignored it because his own head had rattled a bit, too. \u0027Are you sure about that, sir?\u0027 \u0027It is established fact, young Stibbons.\u0027 Ponder had found a grey hair on his comb that morning and was not in the mood to take this standing up. \u0027And precisely in what books does - \u0027 he began, but Ridcully interrupted with unusual diplomacy. Generally he liked little tiffs among the faculty. \u0027A few more inches to prevent mobbing by the ladies should present us with no problems, surely, Mister Stibbons? Oops... \u0027 This last was to Glenda, who had dropped two spoons on the carpet. She gave him a cursory curtsy. \u0027Er, yes... and we should sport the university colours,\u0027 he went on, with a hint of nervousness. Ridcully prided himself on treating the staff well, and indeed did so whenever he remembered them, but the expression of intelligent amusement on the face of the dumpy girl had unnerved him; it was as if a chicken had winked. \u0027Um, yes, yes indeed,\u0027 he said. \u0027The good old red jersey we used to wear in my rowing days, with the big U\u0027s on the front, bold as brass... \u0027 He glanced at the maid, who was frowning. But he was Archchancellor, wasn\u0027t he? It said so on his door, didn\u0027t it? \u0027That\u0027s what we\u0027ll do,\u0027 he declared. \u0027We\u0027ll look into pies, although I\u0027ve seen a few pies that don\u0027t bear looking into, haha, and we\u0027ll adapt the good old red sweater. What\u0027s next, Mister Stibbons?\u0027 \u0027With regard to the chanting, sir. I\u0027ve asked the Master of the Music to work on some options,\u0027 said Ponder smoothly. \u0027We need to select a team as soon as possible.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t see what the rush is,\u0027 said the Chair of Indefinite Studies, who had almost nodded off in the arms of a chocolate biscuit surfeit. \u0027The bequest, remember?\u0027 said the head of the Department of Post-Mortem Communications. \u0027We - \u0027 \u0027Pas devant la domestique!\u0027 snapped the Lecturer in Recent Runes.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-6.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about football—the most important thing about football—is that it is never just about football.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
