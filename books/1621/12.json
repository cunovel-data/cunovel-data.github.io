{"id":94962,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u0027Oh, yeah, the ladies like him,\u0027 said the waiter and sniffed. \u0027Everyone knows he\u0027s got something going on with that vampire up in Uberwald. You know? The one who invented the Temperance League? Vampires who don\u0027t suck blood? Hello, what\u0027s this... ?\u0027\n \u0027Let no one suppose that I am alone in a desire to see a better future for this great game,\u0027 Vetinari was saying. \u0027Tonight, gentlemen, you will see football, hear football and if you don\u0027t duck, gentlemen, you might even eat football. Here to display a marriage of football from the past and I dare hope from the future, I present to you the first team of Unseen University... Unseen Academicals!\u0027\n The candles went out, all at once, even the ones high up in the chandelier; Glenda could see pale ghosts of smoke rising in the gloom. Beside her, Nutt started counting under his breath. One, two... At the count of three, the candles at the far end of the Hall burst into life again, revealing Trevor Likely, wearing his most infectious grin.\n \u0027Evenin\u0027 all,\u0027 he said, \u0027an\u0027 to you too, your lordship. My, but ain\u0027t you lookin\u0027 quite the swell tonight.\u0027 As breaths were indrawn all around the Hall Trev pulled out his tin can, dropped it on to his foot and flicked it up on to his shoulder, where it travelled around the back of his neck and down his other arm.\n \u0027At the start people used to kick rocks. That was sort of stupid. Then they tried skulls, but you had to get \u0027em off people and that led to fightin\u0027.\u0027\n Beside Glenda, Nutt was still counting...\n \u0027An\u0027 now we\u0027ve got what we call a ball,\u0027 Trev continued, as his tin can rolled and climbed around him, \u0027but it ain\u0027t all that, \u0027cos it\u0027s a lump of firewood. You can\u0027t kick it \u0027less you\u0027ve got big heavy boots on. It\u0027s slow. It\u0027s heavy. It don\u0027t live, gentlemen, and football should live... \u0027\n The doors at the other end of the Hall opened and Bengo Macarona trotted in, bouncing the new football. Its gloing, gloing echoed around the Hall. Some of the football captains had got to their feet, craning for a better view.\n \u0027And with the old football, you couldn\u0027t do this,\u0027 said Trev, and dived for the floor as Macarona spun in one balletic movement and sent the ball screaming up the aisle like an angry hornet.\n Some scenes are only ever a memory rather than an experience, because they happen too fast for immediate comprehension, and Glenda watched the subsequent events on the internal screen of horrified recollection. There were the two Archmages and the Tyrant of the city, watching with frozen interest as the spinning globe hummed towards them, dragging terrible consequences in its wake, and then there was the Librarian rising out of nowhere, stopping it dead in mid air with a hand like a shovel.\n \u0027That\u0027s us, gentlemen. And we\u0027ll take on the first team that joins us on the Hippo on Saturday at one o\u0027clock. We\u0027ll be training all around the city. You can join in if you like. And don\u0027t worry if you don\u0027t have the balls! We\u0027ll give you some!\u0027 The candle flames went out, which was just as well because it is hard to riot in the dark. When the flames rose again in their eerie way, shouting, arguments, laughter and even discussion were taking place on every table. Quietly, too, the servants went to and fro with their flagons. There always seemed to be another one, Glenda noticed.\n \u0027What have they been drinking?\u0027 she whispered to the nearest waiter.\n \u0027Winkle\u0027s Old Peculiar, Mages\u0027 Special. It\u0027s top stuff.\u0027\n \u0027What about his lordship?\u0027\n He grinned. \u0027Ha. Funny thing, some of \u0027em have asked me that, too. Just the same as the guests. Poured out of the same flagon, just like for everyone else, so it\u0027s - \u0027 He stopped.\n Lord Vetinari was on his feet again. \u0027Gentlemen, who among you will accept the challenge? It need not be Dimwell, it need not be Dolly Sisters, it need not be the Nappers, it just has to be a team, gentlemen; the Unseen Academicals will take on the best of you, in the best traditions of sportsmanship. I have set the date of the game for Saturday. As far as the Academicals are concerned, you can watch them train and Mister Stibbons will give you all the advice you may need. This will be a fair match, gentlemen, you have my word on it.\u0027 He paused. \u0027Did I mention that when it is presented, the very nearly gold urn will be full of beer? The concept is quite popular, I gather, and I predict that for a reasonable period the golden cup will quite miraculously stay full of beer, no matter how many drink thereof. I shall personally see to it.\u0027\n This got a big cheer, too. Glenda felt embarrassed for the men, but angry at them too. They were being led by the nose. Or, more accurately, by the beer.\n Vetinari didn\u0027t need whips and thumbscrews; he just needed Winkle\u0027s Old Peculiar, Mages\u0027 Special, and he was leading them like little lambs-and matching them pint for pint. How could he manage that? Hey, look at me, he\u0027s saying, I\u0027m just like you, and he\u0027s not like them at all. They can\u0027t have someone killed-she paused the thought to allow consideration of some of the street fights when the pubs shut, and amended it to-and get away with it.\n \u0027My friend the Archchancellor has just informed me that, of course, the Unseen Academicals will not on any account resort to magic! Nobody wants to see a team of frogs, I am sure!\u0027\n There was general laughter at this lame joke, but the plain fact was that right now they would have laughed at a paper bag.\n \u0027This will be a proper football match, gentlemen, no trickery, only skills,\u0027 said the Patrician, his voice sharp again. \u0027And on that note I am decreeing a new code, based on the hallowed and traditional rules of football so recently rediscovered, but including many familiar ones of more recent usage. The office of referee is there to ensure obedience to the rules. There must be rules, my friends. There must be. There is no game without rules. No rules, no game.\u0027\n And there it was. No one else seemed to notice, through the fumes, the razor blade glittering for a moment in the candyfloss. Rules? thought Glenda. What are these new rules? I never knew there were rules. But Lord Vetinari\u0027s assistant, whoever he was, was quietly putting a few sheets of paper in front of each man.\n She remembered old Stollop\u0027s bafflement when confronted with a mere envelope. Some of them could read, surely? But how many of them could read now?\n His lordship had not finished. \u0027Finally, gentlemen, I would like you to peruse and sign the copies of the rules Mister Drumknott has given you. And now I understand the Archchancellor and his colleagues are looking forward to seeing you in the Uncommon Room for cigars and, I believe, an exceptionally rare brandy!\u0027\n Well, that would about wrap it up, wouldn\u0027t it? The footballers were used to just beer. To be fair, they were used to lots of just beer. Nevertheless, if she was any judge, and she was pretty good, they would now be very nearly falling-down drunk. Although some seasoned captains could stand up for some time while being, technically, falling-down drunk. And there is nothing more embarrassing than seeing a falling-down drunk except for when it is a falling-down drunk who is still standing up. And that was amazing: the captains were the type of men who drank in quarts, and could belch the national anthem and bend steel bars with their teeth, or even somebody else\u0027s teeth. Okay, they had never had much in the way of schooling, but why did they have to be so dumb?\n \u0027Tell me,\u0027 murmured Ridcully to Vetinari as they watched the guests file out unsteadily, \u0027are you behind the discovery of the urn?\u0027\n \u0027We have known one another for quite some time, Mustrum, have we not,\u0027 said Vetinari, \u0027and as you know, I would not lie to you.\u0027 He paused for a moment and added, \u0027Well, of course I would lie to you in acceptable circumstances, but on this occasion I can truthfully say that the discovery of the urn came as a surprise to me as well, albeit a pleasant one. Indeed, I assumed that you gentlemen had had something to do with it.\u0027\n \u0027We didn\u0027t even know it was there,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027Personally, I suspect that religion is involved.\u0027\n Vetinari smiled. \u0027Well, of course, classically, gods play with the fates of men, so I suppose there is no reason why it shouldn\u0027t be football. We play and are played and the best we can hope for is to do it with style.\u0027\n It might have been possible to cut the air in the Uncommon Room with a knife, had anyone been able to find a knife. Or hold a knife the right way if found. From the point of view of the wizards, it was business as usual, but while a number of captains were being wheeled away in a wheelbarrow, thoughtfully stationed there earlier in the evening, there were enough visitors still standing to make for a damp, hot hubbub. In an unregarded corner, the Patrician and the two Archchancellors had found a space where they could relax unheeded in the big chairs and settle a few matters.\n \u0027You know, Henry,\u0027 said Vetinari to the former Dean, \u0027I think it would be a very good idea if you were to referee the match.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, come on! I think that would be most unfair,\u0027 said Ridcully.\n \u0027To whom, pray?\u0027\n \u0027Well, er,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027There could be a question of rivalry between wizards.\u0027\n \u0027But on the other hand,\u0027 said Vetinari, his voice all smoothness, \u0027it might also be said that, for political reasons, another wizard would have a vested interest in not allowing a fellow Archmage to be seen to be bested by people who, despite their often amazing talents, skills, features and histories, are nevertheless lumped together in the term ordinary people.\u0027\n Ridcully raised a very big brandy glass in the general direction of the edge of the universe. \u0027I have every faith in my friend Henry,\u0027 he said. \u0027Even though he\u0027s a little bit on the tubby side.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, unfair!\u0027 snapped Henry. \u0027A large man may be quite light on his feet. Is there any chance of me having the poisoned dagger?\u0027\n \u0027In these modern times,\u0027 said Vetinari, \u0027I\u0027m sorry to say that a whistle of some sort will have to suffice.\u0027\n At which point someone tried to slap Vetinari on the back.\n It happened with remarkable speed and ended possibly even faster than it began, with Vetinari still seated in his chair with his beer mug in one hand and the man\u0027s wrist gripped tightly at head height. He let go and said, \u0027Can I help you, sir?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re that Lord Veterinary, ain\u0027t ya? I seed you on them postage stamps.\u0027\n Ridcully glanced up. Some of Lord Vetinari\u0027s clerks were briskly heading towards them, along with some of the slurred speaker\u0027s friends, who could be defined at this point as people who were slightly more sober than he was and right now were sobering up very, very fast, because when you have just slapped a tyrant on the back you need all the friends you can get.\n Vetinari nodded at his gentlemen, who evaporated back into the crowd, and then he snapped his fingers at one of the waiters. \u0027A chair here, please, for my new friend.\u0027\n \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 said Ridcully, as a chair was pushed under the man who, by happy coincidence, was falling backwards in any case.\n \u0027I mean,\u0027 said the man, \u0027everary one saysh you\u0027re a bit of a wnacker, but I saysh you\u0027re awright over thish football fing. \u0027Sno future in jus\u0027 shlogging away. I should know, I got kicked inna head quite a few times.\u0027\n \u0027Really?\u0027 said Lord Vetinari. \u0027And what is your name?\u0027\n \u0027Swithin, shir,\u0027 said the man.\n \u0027Any other name, by any chance?\u0027 said Vetinari.\n \u0027Dustworthy,\u0027 he said. He raised a finger in a kind of salute. \u0027Captain, the Cockbill Boars.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, you aren\u0027t having a good season,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027You need fresh blood in the squad, especially since Jimmy Wilkins got put into the Tanty after eating someone\u0027s nose. Naphill walked all over you because you lost your backbone when both of the Pinchpenny brothers were taken to the Lady Sybil, and you\u0027ve been stuck down in the mud for three seasons. Okay, everyone says that Harry Capstick is making a very good showing since you bought him from Treacle Mine Tuesday for two crates of Winkle\u0027s Old Peculiar and a sack of pork scratchings, which is not bad for a man with a wooden leg, but there\u0027s never anyone in support.\u0027\n A circle of silence spread outwards from Vetinari and the swaying Swithin. Ridcully\u0027s mouth had dropped open and Henry\u0027s brandy glass remained half empty, an unusual occurrence for a glass that\u0027s been in the hands of a wizard for more than fifteen seconds.\n \u0027Also, I\u0027m hearing that your pies are leaving a lot to be desired, such as dead, cooked, organic content,\u0027 continued Vetinari. \u0027Can\u0027t get the Shove behind you when the pies are seen to walk about.\u0027\n \u0027My ladsh,\u0027 said Swithin, \u0027are the besht there ish. It\u0027sh not their fault they\u0027re up againsht better people. They never getsh a chance to play shomeone they can beat. They alwaysh gives it one hundred and twenty pershent and you can\u0027t give more than that. Anyhow, how come you know all this shtuff? It\u0027s not like we\u0027re big in the league.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I take an interest,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027I believe that football is a lot like life.\u0027\n \u0027There ish that, shir, there ish that. You does your besht and then shomeone kicksh you inna fork.\u0027\n \u0027Then I strongly advise you to take an interest in our new football,\u0027 said Vetinari, \u0027which will be about speed, skill and thinking.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yeah, right, I can do all them,\u0027 said Swithin, at which point he fell off his chair.\n \u0027Does this poor man have any friends here?\u0027 said Vetinari, turning to the crowd.\n There was some diffidence among them concerning whether or not it was a good idea to be friends with Swithin at this point.\n Vetinari raised his voice: \u0027I would just like a couple of people to take him back to his home. I would like them to put him to bed and see that no trouble comes to him. Perhaps they ought to stay with him until morning too, because he just might try to commit suicide when he wakes up.\u0027\n \u0027New Dawn For Football\u0027 said the Times when Glenda picked it up the next morning. As was its wont when it was reporting something it thought was particularly important, the paper\u0027s headline was followed by two others in descending sizes of font: \u0027Footballers Sign Up For The New Game\u0027 was on the next line down and then on the next \u0027New Balls A Success\u0027.\n To Glenda\u0027s surprise and dismay, Juliet still had a place on the front page, with the picture of her used smaller than yesterday, under the headline \u0027Mystery Lady Vanishes\u0027, and a paragraph which simply said that no one had seen the mystery model, Jewels, since her debut (Glenda had to look this one up) two days ago. Honestly, she thought, not finding somebody is news? And she was surprised that there was room for even this, since most of the front page was dedicated to the football, but the Times liked to start several stories on the front page and then, just when they were getting interesting, whisk them off to page 35, or somewhere, to end their days behind the crossword and the permanent advert for surgical trusses.\n The leader column inside was headed \u0027Score One For Vetinari\u0027. Glenda never normally read the leader column because there was only a certain number of times she was prepared to see the word \u0027however\u0027 used in a 120-word article.\n She read the front-page story at first glumly and then with rising anger. Vetinari had done it. He had got them drunk and the fools had signed away their football for a pale variety cooked up by the palace and the university. Of course, minds are never quite that simple. She had to admit to herself that she hated the stupidity of the present game. She hated the idiot fighting and mindless shoving, but it was hers to hate. It was something that people themselves had put together and rickety and stupid though it was, it was theirs. And now the nobs were again picking up something that wasn\u0027t theirs and saying how wonderful it was. The old football was going to be banned. That was another little razor blade in Lord Vetinari\u0027s alcoholic candyfloss.\n She was also deeply suspicious about the urn, the picture of which, for some reason, was still on her kitchen table. Since what was claimed to be the original rules was written in an ancient language, how could anyone other than a nob know what they meant? She ran her eye down the description of the new rules. Some of the rules of old street football had survived in there like monsters from another era. She recognized one that she had always liked: the ball shall be called the ball. The ball is the ball that is played as the ball by any three consecutive players, at which point it is the ball. She\u0027d loved it when she first read it for the sheer stupidity of its phraseology. Apparently, it had been added on a day, centuries ago, when an unfortunately severed head had rolled into play and had rather absent-mindedly replaced the ball currently in play on account of some body, formerly belonging to the head, now lying on the original ball. That kind of thing stuck in the memory, especially because after the match the owner of the head was credited with scoring the winning goal.\n That rule and a few others stood out as remnants of a vanished glory in the list of Lord Vetinari\u0027s new regulations. A few nods at the old game had been left in as a kind of sop to public opinion. He should not be allowed to get away with it. Just because he was a tyrant and capable of having just about anybody killed on a whim, people acted as if they were scared of him. Someone ought to tell him off. The world had turned upside down several times. She hadn\u0027t quite got her bearings, but making sure that Lord Vetinari did not get away with it was suddenly very important. It was up to the people to decide when they were being stupid and old-fashioned; it wasn\u0027t up to nobs to tell them what to do.\n With great determination she put on her coat over her apron and, after a moment\u0027s thought, took two freshly made Jammy Devils from her cupboard. Where a battering ram cannot work, really good shortcrust pastry can often break through.\n In the Oblong Office, the Patrician\u0027s personal secretary looked at the stopwatch.\n \u0027Fifty seconds slower than your personal best, I\u0027m afraid, my lord.\u0027\n \u0027Proof indeed that strong drink is a mocker, Drumknott,\u0027 said Vetinari severely.\n \u0027I suspect that no further proof is needed,\u0027 said Drumknott, with his little secretarial smile.\n \u0027Although I would, in fairness, point out that Charlotte of the Times is emerging as the most fearsome crossword compiler of all time, and they are a pretty fearsome lot. But her? Initialisms, odds and evens, hidden words, container reverses, and now diagonals! How does she do it?\u0027\n \u0027Well, you did it, sir.\u0027\n \u0027I undid it. That is much easier.\u0027 Vetinari raised a finger. \u0027It is that woman who runs the pet shop in Pellicool Steps, depend upon it. She hasn\u0027t been mentioned as a winner recently. She must be compiling the things.\u0027\n \u0027The female mind is certainly a devious one, my lord.\u0027\n Vetinari looked at his secretary in surprise. \u0027Well, of course it is. It has to deal with the male one. I think - \u0027\n There was a gentle tap at one of the doors. The Patrician turned back to the Times while Drumknott slipped out of the room. After some whispered exchanges, the secretary returned.\n \u0027It would appear that a young woman has got in via the back gate by bribing the guards, sir. They accepted the bribes, as per your standing orders, and she has been shown into the anteroom, which she will soon find is locked. She wishes to see you because, she says, she has a complaint. She is a maid.\u0027\n Lord Vetinari looked over the top of the paper. \u0027Tell her I can\u0027t help her with that. Perhaps, oh, I don\u0027t know, a different perfume would help?\u0027\n \u0027I mean she is a member of the serving classes, sir. Her name is Glenda Sugarbean.\u0027\n \u0027Tell her - \u0027 Vetinari hesitated, and then smiled. \u0027Ah, yes, Sugarbean. Did she bribe the guards with food? Something baked, perhaps?\u0027\n \u0027Well done, sir! A large Jammy Devil apiece. May I ask how - ?\u0027\n \u0027She is a cook, Drumknott, not a maid. Show her in, by all means.\u0027\n The secretary looked a little resentful. \u0027Are you sure this is wise, sir? I have already told the guards to throw the foodstuffs away.\u0027\n \u0027Food cooked by a Sugarbean? You may have committed a crime against high art, Drumknott. I shall see her now.\u0027\n \u0027I must point out that you have a full schedule this morning, my lord.\u0027\n \u0027Quite so. It is your job to point this out, and I respect that. But I did not return until half past four this morning and I distinctly remember stubbing my toe on the stairs. I am as drunk as a skunk, Drumknott, which of course means skunks are just as drunk as I. I must say the term is unfamiliar to me, and I had not thought hitherto of skunks in this context, but Mustrum Ridcully was kind enough to enlighten me. Allow me, then, a moment of indulgence.\u0027\n \u0027Well, you are the Patrician, sir,\u0027 said Drumknott. \u0027You can do as you please.\u0027\n \u0027That is kind of you to say so, but I did not, in fact, need reminding,\u0027 said Vetinari, with what was almost certainly a smile.\n When the severe thin man opened the door, it was too late to flee. When he said, \u0027His lordship will see you now, Miss Sugarbean,\u0027 it was too late to faint. What had she been thinking of? Had she been thinking at all?\n Glenda followed the man into the next room, which was oak panelled and sombre and the most uncluttered office she had ever seen. The room of the average wizard was so stuffed with miscellaneous things that the walls were invisible. Here, even the desk was clear, apart from a pot of quill pens, an inkwell, an open copy of the Ankh-Morpork Times and�Cher eye stayed fixed on this one, unable to draw itself away�Ca mug with the slogan \u0027To the world\u0027s Greatest Boss\u0027. It was so out of place it might have been an intrusion from another universe.\n A chair was quietly placed behind her. This was just as well, because when the man at the desk looked up she sat down abruptly.\n Vetinari pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. \u0027Miss... Sugarbean, there are whole rooms in this palace full of people who want to see me, and they are powerful and important people, or at least they think they are. Yet Mister Drumknott has kindly inserted in my schedule, ahead of the Postmaster General and the Mayor of Sto Lat, a meeting with a young cook with her coat on over her apron and an intent, it says here, of \"having it out with me\". And this is because I take notice of incongruity, and you, Miss Sugarbean, are incongruous. What is it you want?\u0027\n \u0027Who says I want anything?\u0027\n \u0027Everyone wants something when they are in front of me, Miss Sugarbean, even if it is only to be somewhere else.\u0027\n \u0027All right! You made all the captains drunk last night and got them to sign that letter in the paper!\u0027\n The stare did not flicker. That was much worse than, well, anything.\n \u0027Young lady, drink levels all mankind. It is the ultimate democrat, if you like that sort of thing. A drunk beggar is as drunk as a lord, and so is a lord. And have you ever noticed that all drunks can understand one another, no matter how drunk they are and how different their native tongues? I take it for a certainty that you are a relation to Augusta Sugarbean?\u0027 The question, tagged on to the praises of inebriation, hit her between the eyes, scattering her thoughts.\n \u0027What? Oh. Well, yes. That\u0027s right. She was my grandmother.\u0027\n \u0027And she was a cook at the Guild of Assassins when she was younger?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. She always made a joke about how she wouldn\u0027t let them use any - \u0027 She stopped quickly, but Vetinari finished the sentence for her.\n \u0027 - of her cakes to poison people. And we always obeyed, too, because as you surely know, miss, no one likes to upset a good cook. Is she still with us?\u0027\n \u0027She passed on two years ago, sir.\u0027\n \u0027But since you are a Sugarbean, I assume you have acquired a few more grandmothers as a replacement? Your grandmother was always a stalwart in the community and you must take all those little dainties for someone?\u0027\n \u0027You can\u0027t know that, you\u0027re only guessing. But all right, they\u0027re for all the old ladies that don\u0027t get out much. Anyway, it\u0027s a perk.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, but of course. Every job has its little perks. Why, I don\u0027t expect Drumknott here has bought a paperclip in his life, eh, Drumknott?\u0027\n The secretary, tidying papers in the background, gave a wan little smile.\n \u0027Look, I only take leftovers - \u0027 Glenda began, but this was waved away.\n \u0027You are here about the football,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027You were at the dinner last night, but the university likes its serving girls to be tall and I have an eye for such things. Therefore, I assume you made it your business to be there without bothering your superiors. Why?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re taking their football away from them!\u0027\n The Patrician steepled his fingers and rested his chin on them while he looked at her.\n He\u0027s trying to make me nervous, she thought. It\u0027s working, oh, it\u0027s working.\n Vetinari filled in the silence. \u0027Your grandmother used to do people\u0027s thinking for them. That trait runs in families, always on the female side. Capable women, scurrying about in a world where everyone else seems to be seven years old and keeps on falling over in the playground, picking them up and watching them run right out there again. I imagine you run the Night Kitchen? Too many people in the big one. You want spaces you can control, beyond the immediate reach of fools.\u0027\n If he\u0027d added \u0027Am I right?\u0027 like some windbag seeking applause, she would have hated him. But he was reading her from the inside of her head, in a calm, matter-of-fact way. She had to suppress a shiver, because it was all true.\n \u0027I\u0027m taking nothing from anybody, Miss Sugarbean. I am simply changing the playground,\u0027 the man went on. \u0027What skill is there in the mob pushing and shoving? It is nothing more than a way of bringing on a sweat. No, we must move with the times. I know the Times moves with me. The captains will moan, no doubt, but they are getting old. Dying in the game is a romantic idea when you are young, but when you are older the boot is in the other ear. They know this, even if they won\u0027t admit it, and while they will protest, they will take care not to be taken seriously. In fact, far from taking, I am giving much. Acceptance, recognition, a certain standing, a gold-ish cup and the chance to keep what remains of their teeth.\u0027\n All she could manage after this was, \u0027All right, but you tricked them!\u0027\n \u0027Really? They did not have to drink to excess, did they?\u0027\n \u0027You knew they would!\u0027\n \u0027No. I suspected they might. They could have been more cautious. They should have been more cautious. I\u0027d prefer to say that I led them along the correct path with a little guile rather than drove them along it with sticks. I possess many types of stick, Miss Sugarbean.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027ve been spying on me! You knew about the dainties.\u0027\n \u0027Spying? Madam, it was once said of a great prince that his every thought was of his people. Like him, I watch over my people. I am just better at it, that\u0027s all. As for the dainties business, that was a simple deduction from the known facts of human nature.\u0027\n There was a lot that Glenda wanted to say, but in some very definite way she sensed that the interview�Cor at least the part of it that involved her opening her mouth�Cwas over. Nevertheless, she said, \u0027Why aren\u0027t you drunk?\u0027\n \u0027I beg your pardon?\u0027\n \u0027You must weigh about half of what they do and all of \u0027em went home in wheelbarrows. You drank as much as them and you look fresh as a daisy. What is the trick? Did you get the wizards to magic the beer out of your stomach?\u0027\n She had stopped pushing her luck a long time ago. Now it was out of control, like a startled carthorse that can\u0027t stop because of the huge load bouncing and rumbling along behind it.\n Vetinari frowned. \u0027My dear lady, anyone drunk enough to let wizards, who themselves had just been partaking copiously of the fruit of the vine, I might add, take anything out of him would already be so drunk as to be dead. To forestall your next comment, the hop is also, technically, a vine. I am, in fact, drunk. Is this not so, Drumknott?\u0027\n \u0027You did indeed consume some twelve pints of very strong malted beverage, sir. Technically, you must be drunk.\u0027\n \u0027Idiosyncratically put, Drumknott. Thank you.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t act drunk!\u0027\n \u0027No, but I do act sober quite well, don\u0027t you think? And I must confess that this morning\u0027s crossword was something of a tussle. Procatalepsis and pleonasm in one day? I had to use the dictionary! The woman is a fiend! Nevertheless, thank you for coming, Miss Sugarbean. I recall your grandmother\u0027s bubble and squeak with great fondness. If she had been a sculptress, it would have been an exquisite statue, with no arms and an enigmatic smile. It is such a shame that some masterpieces are so transitory.\u0027\n The proud cook in Glenda rose unstoppably. \u0027But she passed the recipe on to me.\u0027\n \u0027A legacy better than jewels,\u0027 said Vetinari, nodding.\n Actually a few jewels would not have gone amiss, Glenda reflected. But there was a secret of Bubble and Squeak, of course, right out there in the open where everyone could miss it. And as for the Truth of Salmagundi...\n \u0027I believe this audience is at an end, Miss Sugarbean,\u0027 said Vetinari. \u0027I have so much to do and so have you, I am sure.\u0027 He picked up his pen and turned his attention to the documents in front of him. \u0027Goodbye, Miss Sugarbean.\u0027\n And that was it. Somehow, she was at the door, and it had almost closed behind her when a voice said, \u0027And thank you for your kindnesses to Nutt.\u0027\n The door clicked shut, nearly hitting her in the face as she spun round.\n \u0027Was that a wise thing for me to have said, do you think?\u0027 said Vetinari, when she had gone.\n \u0027Possibly not, sir, but she will merely assume it is her that we are watching,\u0027 said Drumknott smoothly.\n \u0027Possibly we should. That\u0027s a Sugarbean woman for you, Drumknott, little domestic slaves until they think someone has been wronged and then they go to war like Queen Ynci of Lancre, with chariot wheels spinning and arms and legs all over the place.\u0027\n \u0027And no father,\u0027 observed Drumknott. \u0027Not very good for a child in those days.\u0027\n \u0027Only served to make her tougher. One can only hope she doesn\u0027t take it into her head to enter politics.\u0027\n \u0027Is that not what she is doing now, sir?\u0027\n \u0027Well noted, Drumknott. Do I appear drunk?\u0027\n \u0027In my opinion no, sir, but you seem unusually... talkative.\u0027\n \u0027Coherently?\u0027\n \u0027To the minutest scruple, sir. The Postmaster is waiting, sir, and some of the guild leaders want to talk to you urgently.\u0027\n \u0027I suspect they want to play football?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir. They intend to form teams. I cannot for the life of me understand why.\u0027\n Vetinari put down his pen. \u0027Drumknott, if you saw a ball lying invitingly on the ground, would you kick it?\u0027\n The secretary\u0027s forehead wrinkled. \u0027How would the invitation be couched, sir?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry?\u0027\n \u0027Would it be, for example, a written note attached to the ball by person or persons unknown?\u0027\n \u0027I was rather inclining to the idea that you might perhaps feel simply that the whole world was silently willing you to give said ball a hearty kick?\u0027\n \u0027No, sir. There are too many variables. Possibly an enemy or japester might have assumed that I would take some action of the kind and made the ball out of concrete or similar material, in the hope I might do myself a serious or humorous injury. So, I would check first.\u0027\n \u0027And then, if all was in order, you would kick the ball?\u0027\n \u0027To what purpose or profit, sir?\u0027\n \u0027Interesting question. I suppose for the joy of seeing it fly.\u0027\n Drumknott seemed to consider this for a while, and then shook his head. \u0027I am sorry, sir, but you have lost me at this point.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, you are a pillar of rock in a world of changes, Drumknott. Well done.\u0027\n \u0027I was wondering if I could just add something, sir,\u0027 said the secretary solemnly.\n \u0027The floor is yours, Drumknott.\u0027\n \u0027I would not like it thought that I do not buy my own paperclips, sir. I enjoy owning my own paperclips. It means that they are mine. I thought it helpful I should tell you that in a measured and non-confrontational way.\u0027\n Vetinari looked at the ceiling for a few moments and then said: \u0027Thank you for your frankness. I shall consider the record straightened and the matter closed.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you, sir.\u0027\n Sator Square was where the city went when it was upset, baffled or fearful. People who had no real idea why they were doing so congregated to listen to other people who also did not know anything, on the basis that ignorance shared is ignorance doubled. There were clusters of people there this morning and several scratch teams, for it is written, or more probably scrawled on a wall somewhere, that wherever two or more are gathered together, at least one will have something to kick. Tin cans and tightly wound balls of rag were annoying adults on all sides, but as Glenda hurried nearer, the big doors of the university opened and Ponder Stibbons stepped out, somewhat inexpertly bouncing one of the wretched new leather balls. Gloing! Silence clanged, as rolling cans rattled on unheeded. All eyes were on the wizard and on the ball. He threw it down and there was a double gloing! as it bounced off the stones. And then he kicked it. It was a bit wussy as kicks went, that kick, but no one in the square had ever kicked anything even one tenth as far, and every male chased after it, propelled by ancient instinct.\n They\u0027ve won, Glenda thought glumly. A ball that goes gloing! when others go clunk... Well, where\u0027s the contest?\n She hurried on to the back entrance. In a world that was getting too complicated, where she could barge in on the black-hearted Tyrant and walk out unscathed, she needed a place to go that wasn\u0027t spinning. The Night Kitchen was as familiar as her bedroom, her place, under her control. She could face anything there.\n There was a figure lounging against the wall by the rubbish bins, and for some reason she identified it right away, despite the heavy cloak and the hat pulled down over the eyes; no one she had ever met could relax as perfectly as Pepe.\n \u0027Wotcher, Glenda,\u0027 said a voice from under the hat.\n \u0027What are you doing here?\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Do you know how hard it is to find somebody in this city when you can\u0027t tell anyone what they look like and aren\u0027t really sure you can remember their name?\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Where\u0027s Jools?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she said. \u0027I haven\u0027t seen her since last night.\u0027\n \u0027It might be a good idea to find her before other people do,\u0027 said Pepe.\n \u0027What people?\u0027 said Glenda.\n Pepe shrugged. \u0027Everybody,\u0027 he said. \u0027They\u0027re mostly looking in the dwarf districts right now, but it can only be a matter of time. We can\u0027t move down at the shop for them and it was all I could do to sneak out.\u0027\n \u0027What are they after her for?\u0027 said Glenda, panic rising. \u0027I saw in the paper that people were trying to find her, but she hasn\u0027t done anything wrong!\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think you exactly grasp what\u0027s going on,\u0027 said the (possible) dwarf. \u0027They want to find her to ask her a lot of questions.\u0027\n \u0027Has this got anything to do with Lord Vetinari?\u0027 said Glenda suspiciously.\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have thought so,\u0027 said Pepe.\n \u0027What sort of questions, then?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, you know-What is your favourite colour? What do you like to eat? Are you an item with anybody? What advice do you have for young people today? Do you wax? Where do you get your hair done? What is your favourite spoon?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think she\u0027s got a favourite spoon,\u0027 said Glenda, waiting for the world to make some sense.\n Pepe patted her on the shoulder. \u0027Look, she\u0027s on the front page of the paper, isn\u0027t she? And the Times keeps on at us about wanting to do a lifestyle profile of her. That might not actually be a bad thing, but it\u0027s up to you.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think she\u0027s got a lifestyle,\u0027 said Glenda, a little bewildered. \u0027She\u0027s never said. And she doesn\u0027t wax. She hardly even dusts. Anyway, just tell them all that she doesn\u0027t want to talk to anybody.\u0027\n Pepe\u0027s expression went strange for a moment, then he said with care, like a man, or dwarf, struggling to be heard across a cultural divide, \u0027Do you think I was talking about furniture?\u0027\n \u0027Well, what else? And I don\u0027t think her housework is anyone else\u0027s business.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you understand? She\u0027s popular, and the more we tell people they can\u0027t talk to her, the more they want to, and the more you say no the more interested they become. People want to know all about her,\u0027 said Pepe.\n \u0027Like what her favourite spoon is?\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027I might have been a bit ironic,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027But there\u0027s newspaper writers all over the city looking for her and Bu-bubble want to do a two-page spread on her.\u0027 He paused. \u0027That means they\u0027ll write about her and it\u0027ll take two pages,\u0027 he volunteered helpfully. \u0027The Low King of the dwarfs has said that she is an icon for our times, according to Satblatt.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s Satblatt?\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027Oh, the dwarf newspaper,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027You\u0027ll probably never see it.\u0027\n \u0027But she was just in a fashion show!\u0027 wailed Glenda. \u0027She was just walking up and down! I\u0027m sure she doesn\u0027t want to get involved in all that sort of thing.\u0027\n Pepe gave her a sharp look. \u0027Are you?\u0027 he said.\n And then she thought, really thought about Juliet, who would read Bu-bubble from cover to cover, wouldn\u0027t generally go near the Times, but would absorb all kinds of rubbish about frivolous and silly people. People that glittered. \u0027I don\u0027t know where she is,\u0027 she said. \u0027I really haven\u0027t seen her since yesterday.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, a mystery disappearance,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Look, we\u0027re already learning about this sort of thing down at the shop. Can we go somewhere a bit more private? I hope none of them followed me up here.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I can smuggle you in through the back entrance, as long as there isn\u0027t a bledlow around,\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027Fine by me. I\u0027m used to that sort of thing.\u0027\n She led him through the doorway and into the maze of cellars and yards that contrasted rather interestingly with the fine frontage of Unseen University.\n \u0027Got anything to drink?\u0027 said Pepe behind her.\n \u0027Water!\u0027 snapped Glenda.\n \u0027I\u0027ll drink water when fish climb out of it to take a piss, but thank you all the same,\u0027 said Pepe.\n And then Glenda caught the smell of baking coming from the Night Kitchen. She was the only one who baked in her kitchen! No one else was supposed to bake in her kitchen. Baking was her responsibility. Hers. She ran up the steps with Pepe behind her and noted that the mystery cook had yet to master the second most important rule of cooking, which was to tidy things up afterwards. The place was a mess. There were even lumps of dough on the floor. In fact, it looked as though it had been possessed by some kind of frenzy. And in the middle of it all, curled up on Glenda\u0027s battered and slightly rancid old armchair, was Juliet.\n \u0027Just like Sleeping Beauty, ain\u0027t it?\u0027 said Pepe behind her.\n Glenda ignored him and hurried along the rows of ovens. \u0027She\u0027s been baking pies. What on earth did she want to come along and bake pies for? She\u0027s never been any good at baking pies.\u0027 That\u0027s because I\u0027ve never let her bake a pie, she told herself. That\u0027s because as soon as she found anything difficult you took it away and did it yourself, her inner voice scolded.\n Glenda opened oven door after oven door. They had arrived just in time. By the smell of it, a couple of dozen assorted pies were cooked to a turn.\n \u0027How about a drink?\u0027 said Pepe, in whom thirst sprang eternal. \u0027I\u0027m sure there\u0027s brandy. Every kitchen has some brandy in it somewhere.\u0027\n He watched as Glenda pulled the pies out, using her apron to protect her hands. Pepe regarded the pies with the indifference of a man who likes to drink his meals and listened to Glenda\u0027s sotto voce monologue as pie after pie was laid out on the table.\n \u0027I never told her to do this. Why did she do this?\u0027 Because I did tell her to do this, sort of, that\u0027s why. \u0027And these are not half bad pies,\u0027 she said more loudly. In surprise.\n Juliet opened her eyes, looked around blearily, and then her face contorted in panic.\n \u0027It\u0027s okay, I\u0027ve taken them all out,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Well done.\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t know what else to do and Trev was busy with the footballing and I thought they would be wantin\u0027 pies tomorrow and I thought I better do some,\u0027 said Juliet. \u0027Sorry.\u0027\n Glenda took a step backwards. How to begin? she wondered. How to unravel it and then ravel it all back up again in a better shape because she had been wrong? Juliet hadn\u0027t just walked up and down with clothes on, she had become some kind of a dream. A dream of clothes. Sparkling and alive and tantalizingly possible. And in Glenda\u0027s memory of the fashion show, she literally shone, as if being lit from the inside. It was a kind of magic and it shouldn\u0027t be making pies. She cleared her throat.\n \u0027I\u0027ve taught you a lot of things, haven\u0027t I, Juliet?\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027Yes, Glenda,\u0027 said Juliet.\n \u0027And they\u0027ve always been useful, haven\u0027t they?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Glenda. I remember it was you that said I should always keep my hand on my ha\u0027penny and I\u0027m very glad that you did.\u0027\n There was a strange noise from Pepe, and Glenda, feeling her face go red, didn\u0027t dare look at him.\n \u0027Then I\u0027ve got a bit more advice for you, Juliet.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Glenda.\u0027\n \u0027First, never, ever apologize for anything that doesn\u0027t need apologizing for,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027And especially never apologize for just being yourself.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Glenda.\u0027\n \u0027Got that?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Glenda.\u0027\n \u0027No matter what happens, always remember that you now know how to make a good pie.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Glenda.\u0027\n \u0027Pepe is here because Bu-bubble wants to write something about you,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027Your picture was in the paper again this morning and - \u0027 Glenda stopped. \u0027She is going to be all right, isn\u0027t she?\u0027 she said.\n Pepe paused in the act of surreptitiously removing a bottle from a cupboard. \u0027You can trust me and Madame on that,\u0027 he said. \u0027Only people who are very trustworthy would dare to look as untrustworthy as me and Madame.\u0027\n \u0027And all she will have to do is show off clothes - Don\u0027t drink that, that\u0027s cider vinegar!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m only drinking the cider bit,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Yes, all she\u0027ll have to do is show off clothes, but to judge from the mob back at the shop there\u0027s going to be people who want her to show off shoes, hats, hairstyles... \u0027\n \u0027No hanky panky,\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll find, anywhere in the world, a greater expert in both hanky and panky than Madame. In fact, I would be surprised if you, Glenda, knew one hundredth of the hanky and panky that she does, especially as she invented quite a lot of it herself. And since we\u0027ll notice it when we see it, we\u0027ll keep an eye on her.\u0027\n \u0027And she\u0027s got to eat proper meals and get a good night\u0027s sleep,\u0027 said Glenda.\n Pepe nodded, although she expected that both those concepts were quite alien to him.\n \u0027And paid,\u0027 she added.\n \u0027We\u0027ll cut her in on the profits if she works exclusively for us,\u0027 said Pepe. \u0027Madame wants to talk to you about that.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, someone might want to pay her more than you do,\u0027 said Glenda.\n \u0027My, my, my. How fast we learn. I\u0027m sure Madame will have great fun talking to you.\u0027\n Juliet looked from one to the other, sleep still wreathing her face. \u0027You want me to go back to the shop?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want you to do anything,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027It\u0027s up to you, okay? It\u0027s just up to you, but it seems to me that if you stay here then basically what you\u0027ll be doing is pies.\u0027\n \u0027Well, not just pies,\u0027 said Juliet.\n \u0027Well, no, fair enough, there are also flans, bubble and squeak and assorted late-night dainties,\u0027 said Glenda. \u0027But you know what I mean. On the other hand, you could go and show off all these fancy clothes and go to lots of fancy places a long, long way from here and see a lot of new people and you\u0027d know that if it all goes pear-shaped you could always make it pie-shaped.\u0027\n \u0027Hah, nice one,\u0027 said Pepe, who\u0027d found another bottle.\n \u0027I really would like to go,\u0027 said Juliet.\n \u0027Then go now. I mean right now, or at least as soon as he\u0027s finished drinking the ketchup.\u0027\n \u0027But I\u0027ll have to go back for my stuff!\u0027\n Glenda reached down inside her vest and pulled out a burgundy-coloured booklet with the seal of Ankh-Morpork on it.\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 said Juliet.\n \u0027Your bank book. Your money\u0027s safe in the bank and you can take it out any time you want.\u0027\n Juliet turned the bank book over and over in her hands. \u0027I don\u0027t fink anyone in my family\u0027s ever been in a bank except for Uncle Geoffrey and they caught up with \u0027im even before he got home.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-12.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: \n Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) \n The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. \n Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .).
