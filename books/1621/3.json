{"id":94953,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"When she came in the next morning there was a dictionary of Dwarfish and a copy of Postalume\u0027s The Speech of Trolls on the lectern too. Surely it\u0027s not right to learn like this, she told herself. It can\u0027t be settling properly. You can\u0027t just fork it into your head. Learning has to be digested. You don\u0027t just have to know, you have to comprehend. She mentioned this to Fassel, the smith, who said, \u0027Look, miss, he came up to me the other day and said he\u0027d watched a smith before, and could he have a go? Well, you know her ladyship\u0027s orders, so I gave him a bit of bar stock and showed him the hammer and tongs and next minute he was going at it like�Cwell, hammer and tongs! Turned out a nice little knife, very nice indeed. He thinks about things. You can see his ugly little mush working it all out. Have you ever met a goblin before?\u0027 \u0027Strange you should ask,\u0027 she told him. \u0027Our catalogue says we\u0027ve got one of the very few copies of J. P. Bunderbell\u0027s Five Hours and Sixteen Minutes Among the Goblins of Far Uberwald, but I can\u0027t find it anywhere. It\u0027s priceless.\u0027 \u0027Five hours and sixteen minutes doesn\u0027t sound very long,\u0027 said the smith. \u0027You\u0027d think so, wouldn\u0027t you? But according to a lecture Mr Blunderbell gave to the Ankh-Morpork Trespassers\u0027 Society,\u0027 said Miss Healstether, \u0027it was about five hours too long. He said they ranged in size from unpleasantly large to disgustingly small, had about the same level of culture as yogurt and spent their time picking their own noses and missing. A complete waste of space, he said. It caused quite a stir. Anthropologists are not supposed to write that sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027And young Nutt is one of them?\u0027 \u0027Yes, that puzzled me, too. Did you see him yesterday? There\u0027s something about him that frightens horses, so he came to the library and found some old book about the Horseman\u0027s Word. They were a kind of secret society, which knew how to make special oils that would make horses obey them. Then he spent the afternoon down in Igor\u0027s crypt, brewing up gods know what, and this morning he was riding a horse around the yard! It wasn\u0027t happy, mind you, but he was winning.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m surprised his ugly little head doesn\u0027t explode,\u0027 said Fassel. \u0027Ha!\u0027 Miss Healstether sounded bitter. \u0027Stand by, then, because he\u0027s discovered the Bonk School.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 \u0027Not that, them. Philosophers. Well, I say philosophers, but, well... \u0027 \u0027Oh, the mucky ones,\u0027 said Fassel cheerfully. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t say mucky,\u0027 said Miss Healstether, and this was true. A ladylike librarian would not employ that word in the presence of a smith, especially one who was grinning. \u0027Let\u0027s say \"indelicate\", shall we?\u0027 There is not a lot of call for delicacy on an anvil, so the smith continued unabashed: \u0027They are the ones who go on about what happens if ladies don\u0027t get enough mutton, and they say cigars are - \u0027 \u0027That is a fallacy!\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right, that\u0027s what I read.\u0027 The smith was clearly enjoying this. \u0027And Ladyship lets him read this stuff?\u0027 \u0027Indeed, she very nearly insists. I can\u0027t imagine what she\u0027s thinking.\u0027 Or him, come to that, she thought to herself. There was a limit to how many candles he should make, Trev had told Nutt. It looked bad if he made too many, Trev explained. The pointy hats might decide that they didn\u0027t need all the people. That made sense to Nutt. What would No Face and Concrete and Weepy Mukko do? They would have nowhere else to go. They had to live in a simple world; they too easily got knocked down by life in this one. He\u0027d tried wandering around the other cellars, but there was nothing much happening at night, and people gave him funny looks. Ladyship did not rule here. But wizards are a messy lot and nobody tidied up much and lived to tell the tale, so all sorts of old storerooms and junk-filled workshops became his for the use of. And there was so much for a lad with keen night vision to find. He had already seen some luminous spoon ants carrying a fork, and, to his surprise, the forgotten mazes were home to that very rare indoorovore, the Uncommon Sock Eater. There were some things living up in the pipes, too, which periodically murmured, \u0027Awk! Awk!\u0027 Who knew what strange monsters made their home here? He cleaned the pie plates very carefully indeed. Glenda had been kind to him. He must show that he was kind, too. It was important to be kind. And he knew where to find some acid. Lord Vetinari\u0027s personal secretary stepped into the Oblong Office with barely a disturbance in the air. His lordship glanced up. \u0027Ah, Drumknott. I think I shall have to write to the Times again. I am certain that one down, six across and nine down appeared in that same combination three months ago. On a Friday, I believe.\u0027 He dropped the crossword page on to the desk with a look of disdain. \u0027So much for a Free Press.\u0027 \u0027Well done, my lord. The Archchancellor has just entered the palace.\u0027 Vetinari smiled. \u0027He must have looked at the calendar at last. Thank goodness they have Ponder Stibbons. Show him straight in after the customary wait.\u0027 Five minutes later, Mustrum Ridcully was ushered in. \u0027Archchancellor! To what urgent matter do I owe this visit? Our usual meeting is not until the day after tomorrow, I believe.\u0027 \u0027Er, yes,\u0027 said Ridcully. As he sat down, a very large sherry was placed in front of him. \u0027Well, Havelock, the fact of the matter is - \u0027 \u0027But it is in fact quite providential that you have arrived just now,\u0027 Vetinari went on, ignoring him, \u0027because a problem has arisen on which I would like your advice.\u0027 \u0027Oh? Really?\u0027 \u0027Yes, indeed. It concerns this wretched game called foot-the-ball... \u0027 \u0027It does?\u0027 The glass, now in Ridcully\u0027s hand, trembled not a fraction. He\u0027d held his job for a long time, right back to the days when a wizard who blinked died. \u0027One has to move with the times, of course,\u0027 said the Patrician, shaking his head. \u0027We tend not to, over the road,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027It only encourages them.\u0027 \u0027People do not understand the limits of tyranny,\u0027 said Vetinari, as if talking to himself. \u0027They think that because I can do what I like I can do what I like. A moment\u0027s thought reveals, of course, that this cannot be so.\u0027 \u0027Oh, it is the same with magic,\u0027 said the Archchancellor. \u0027If you flash spells around like there\u0027s no tomorrow, there\u0027s a good chance that there won\u0027t be.\u0027 \u0027In short,\u0027 Vetinari continued, still talking to the air, \u0027I am intending to give my blessing to the game of football, in the hope that its excesses can be more carefully controlled.\u0027 \u0027Well, it worked with the Thieves\u0027 Guild,\u0027 Ridcully observed, amazed at his own calmness. \u0027If there has to be crime, then it should be organized, I think that\u0027s what you said.\u0027 \u0027Exactly. I have to admit to the view that all exercise for any purpose other than bodily health, the defence of the realm and the proper action of the bowels is barbaric.\u0027 \u0027Really? What about agriculture?\u0027 \u0027Defence of the realm against starvation. But I see no point in people just... running about. Did you catch your Megapode, by the way?\u0027 How the hells does he do it? Ridcully wondered. I mean, how? Aloud, he said, \u0027Indeed we did, but surely you are not suggesting that we were merely \"running about\"?\u0027 \u0027Of course not. All three exceptions apply. Tradition is at least as important as bowels, if not quite so useful. And, indeed, the Poor Boys\u0027 Fun has some remarkable traditions of its own, which some might find it worthwhile exploring. Let me be frank, Mustrum. I cannot enforce a mere personal dislike against public pressure. Well, I can, strictly speaking, but not without going to ridiculous and indeed tyrannical lengths. Over a game? I think not. So... as things stand, we find teams of burly men pushing and shoving and kicking and biting in the faint hope, it seems to me, of propelling some wretched object at some distant goal. I have no problem with them trying to kill one another, which has little in the way of a downside, but it has now become so popular once more that property is being damaged, and that cannot be tolerated. There have been comments in the Times. No, what the wise man cannot change he must channel.\u0027 \u0027And how do you intend to do that?\u0027 \u0027By giving the job to you. Unseen University has always had a fine sporting tradition.\u0027 \u0027\"Had\" is the right word,\u0027 sighed Ridcully. \u0027In my day we were all so... so relentlessly physical. But if I was to suggest so much as an egg and spoon race these days they\u0027d use the spoon to eat the egg.\u0027 \u0027Alas, I did not know your day was over, Mustrum,\u0027 said Lord Vetinari, with a smile. The room, never normally noisy, sank into deeper silence. \u0027Now look here - \u0027 Ridcully began. \u0027This afternoon I shall be speaking to the editor of the Times,\u0027 said Vetinari, gently surfing his voice over that of the wizard with all the skill of a born committee manipulator, \u0027who is, as we know, a very civic-minded person. I\u0027m sure he will welcome the fact that I am asking the university to tame the demon foot-the-ball, and that you have, after careful thought, agreed to the task.\u0027 I don\u0027t have to do this, Ridcully thought carefully. On the other hand, since it is what I want, and thereby don\u0027t have to ask for, this may be unwise. Damn! This is so like him! \u0027You would not object if we raise our own team?\u0027 he managed. \u0027Indeed, I positively demand that you do so. But no magic, Mustrum. I must make that clear. Magic is not sporting, unless you are playing against other wizards, of course.\u0027 \u0027Oh, I am a very sporting man, Havelock.\u0027 \u0027Capital! How is the Dean settling in at Brazeneck, by the way?\u0027 If it had been anyone else asking, Ridcully thought, that would simply be a polite enquiry. But this is Vetinari, isn\u0027t it... \u0027I\u0027ve been too busy to find out,\u0027 he said loftily, \u0027but I\u0027m sure he will be fine when he finds his feet.\u0027 Or manages to see them without a mirror, he added to himself. \u0027I\u0027m sure you must be pleased to see your old friend and colleague making his way in the world,\u0027 said Vetinari, innocently. \u0027And so is Pseudopolis itself, of course. I must say, I admire the sturdy burghers of that city for embarking on their noble experiment in this... this democracy,\u0027 he went on. \u0027It is always good to see it attempted again. And sometimes amusing, too.\u0027 \u0027There is something to be said for it, you know,\u0027 grunted Ridcully. \u0027Yes, I believe you practise it at the university,\u0027 said the Patrician, with a little smile. \u0027However, on the matter of football we are in accord. Capital. I will tell Mister de Worde what you are doing. I\u0027m sure that the keen players of foot-the-ball will be interested, when someone explains the longer words to them. Well done. Do try the sherry. I am told it is highly palatable.\u0027 Vetinari stood up, a signal that, in theory at least, the business of the meeting was concluded, and strolled over to a polished stone slab, set into a square wooden table. \u0027On a different note, Mustrum... How is your young visitor?\u0027 \u0027My visit - Oh, you mean the... uh... \u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027 Vetinari smiled at the slab as if sharing a joke with it. \u0027The, as you put it, Uh.\u0027 \u0027I note the sarcasm. As a wizard, I must tell you that words have power.\u0027 \u0027As a politician, I must tell you I already know. How is he getting along? Concerned minds would like to know.\u0027 Ridcully glanced at the little carved men on the playing slab as if they were listening to him. In a roundabout way, they probably were. Certainly it was well known now that the hands that guided half the pieces lived in a big castle in Uberwald, and were female and belonged to a lady who was mostly rumour. \u0027Smeems says he keeps himself to himself. He says he thinks the boy is cunning.\u0027 \u0027Oh, good,\u0027 said Vetinari, still seeming to find something totally engrossing in the layout of playing pieces. \u0027Good?\u0027 \u0027We need cunning people in Ankh-Morpork. We have a Street of Cunning Artificers, do we not?\u0027 \u0027Well, yes, but - \u0027 \u0027Ah, then it is context that has power,\u0027 said Vetinari, turning around with a look of unmasked delight. \u0027Did I say that I am a politician? Cunning: artful, sly, deceptive, shrewd, astute, cute, on the ball and, indeed, arch. A word for any praise and every prejudice. Cunning... is a cunning word.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t think that maybe this... experiment of yours might be a step too far?\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027People said that about the vampires, did they not? It\u0027s alleged that they have no proper language, but I am told he speaks several languages fluently.\u0027 \u0027Smeems did say he talked la-di-da,\u0027 Ridcully admitted. \u0027Mustrum, compared with Natchbull Smeems, trolls speak la-di-da.\u0027 \u0027The... boy was brought up by a priest of some sort, I know that,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027But what will he become when he grows up?\u0027 \u0027By the sound of him, a professor of linguistics.\u0027 \u0027You know what I mean, Havelock.\u0027 \u0027Possibly, although I wonder if you do. But he is, I suggest, unlikely to become a ravening horde all by himself.\u0027 Ridcully sighed. He glanced towards the game again, and Vetinari noticed. \u0027Look at them. Ranks, files,\u0027 he said, waving a hand over the little stone figures, \u0027locked in everlasting conflict at the whim of the player. They fight, they fall, and they cannot turn back because the whips drive them on, and all they know is whips, kill or be killed. Darkness in front of them, darkness behind them, darkness and whips in their heads. But what if you could take one out of this game, get him before the whips do, take him to a place without whips�Cwhat might he become? One creature. One singular being. Would you deny them that chance?\u0027 \u0027You had three men hanged last week,\u0027 said Ridcully, without quite understanding why. \u0027They had their chances. They used them to kill, and worse. All we get is a chance. We don\u0027t get a benison. He was chained to an anvil for seven years. He should get his chance, don\u0027t you think?\u0027 Suddenly Vetinari was smiling again. \u0027Let us not get sombre, however. I look forward to your ushering in a new era of lively, healthy activity in the best sporting tradition. Indeed, tradition will be your friend here, I am sure. Please don\u0027t let me trespass any further on your time.\u0027 Ridcully drained the sherry. That at least was palatable. It\u0027s a short walk from the palace to Unseen University; positions of power like to keep an eye on one another. Ridcully walked back through the crowds, occasionally nodding at people he knew, which, in this part of the city, was practically everyone. Trolls, he thought, we get along with trolls, now that they remember to look where they\u0027re putting their feet. Got \u0027em in the Watch and everything. Jolly decent types, bar a few bad apples, and gods know we have enough of those of our own. Dwarfs? Been here for ages. Can be a bit tricky, can be as tight as a duck\u0027s arse�Chere he paused to think and edited that thought to \u0027drive a hard bargain\u0027. You always know where you are with them, anyway, and of course they are short, which is always a comfort provided you know what they are doing down there. Vampires? Well, the Uberwald League of Temperance seemed to be working. Word on the street�Cor in the vault or whatever�Cwas that they policed their own. Any unreformed bloodsucker who tried to make a killing in the city would be hunted down by people who knew exactly how they thought and where they hung out. Lady Margolotta was behind all that. She was the person who, by diplomacy, and probably more direct means, had got things moving again in Uberwald, and she had some sort of... relationship with Vetinari. Everyone knew it, and that was all everyone knew. A dot dot dot relationship. One of those. And nobody had been able to join up the dots. She had been to the city on diplomatic visits, and not even the well-practised dowagers of Ankh-Morpork had been able to detect a whisper of anything other than a businesslike amiability and international cooperation between the two of them. And he played endless and complex games with her, via the clacks system, and apart from that, that was, well, that... until now. And she\u0027d sent him this Nutt to keep safe. Who knew why, apart from them? Politics, probably. Ridcully sighed. One of the monsters, all alone. It was hard to think of it. They came in thousands, like lice, killing everything and eating the dead, including theirs. The Evil Empire had bred them in huge cellars, grey demons without a hell. The gods alone knew what had happened to them when the Empire collapsed. But there was convincing evidence now that some still lived up in the far hills. What might they do? And one, right now, was making candles in Ridcully\u0027s cellars. What might he become? \u0027A bloody nuisance?\u0027 said Ridcully aloud. \u0027\u0027ere, \u0027oo are you calling a nuisance, mister? It\u0027s my road, same as yours!\u0027 The wizard looked down at a young man who appeared to have stolen his clothes only from the best washing lines, though the tattered black and red scarf around his neck was probably his own. There was an edginess to him, a continual shifting of weight, as though he might at any moment run off in a previously unguessable direction. And he was throwing a tin can up in the air and catching it again. For Ridcully it brought back memories so sharp that they stung, but he pulled himself together. \u0027I am Mustrum Ridcully, Archchancellor and Master of Unseen University, young man, and I see you are sporting colours. For some game? A game of football, I suggest?\u0027 \u0027As it happens, yes. So what?\u0027 said the urchin, then realized that his hand was empty when it should now, under normal gravitational rules, be full again. The tin had not fallen back from its last ascent, and was in fact turning gently twenty feet up in the air. \u0027Childish of me, I know,\u0027 said Ridcully, \u0027but I did want your full attention. I want to witness a game of football.\u0027 \u0027Witness? Look, I never saw nuffin\u0027 - \u0027 Ridcully sighed. \u0027I mean I want to watch a game, okay? Today, if possible.\u0027 \u0027You? Are you sure? It\u0027s your funeral, mister. Got a shilling?\u0027 There was a clink, high above. \u0027The tin will come back down with a sixpence in it. Time and place, please.\u0027 \u0027\u0027ow do I know I can trust you?\u0027 said the urchin. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Ridcully. \u0027The subtle workings of the brain are a mystery to me, too. But I\u0027m glad that is your belief.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 With a shrug, the boy decided to gamble, what with having had no breakfast. \u0027Loop Alley off the Scours, \u0027arp arsed one, an\u0027 I\u0027ve never seen you before in my life, got it?\u0027 \u0027That is quite probable,\u0027 said Ridcully, and snapped his fingers. The tin dropped into the urchin\u0027s waiting hand. He shook out the silver coin and grinned. \u0027Best o\u0027 luck to you, guv.\u0027 \u0027Is there anything to eat at these affairs?\u0027 said Ridcully, for whom lunchtime was a sacrament. \u0027There\u0027s pies, guv, pease pudding, jellied eel pies, pie and mash, lobster... pies, but mostly they are just pies. Just pies, sir. Made of pie.\u0027 \u0027What kind?\u0027 His informant looked shocked. \u0027They\u0027re pies, guv. You don\u0027t ask.\u0027 Ridcully nodded. \u0027And as a final transaction, I\u0027ll pay you one penny for a kick of your can.\u0027 \u0027Tuppence,\u0027 said the boy promptly. \u0027You little scamp, we have a deal.\u0027 Ridcully dropped the can on the toe of his boot, balanced it for a moment, then flicked it into the air and, as it came down, hit it with a roundhouse kick that sent it spinning over the crowd. \u0027Not bad, granddad,\u0027 said the kid, grinning. In the distance there was a yell and the sound of someone bent on retribution. Ridcully plunged a hand into his pocket and looked down. \u0027Two dollars to start running, kid. You won\u0027t get a better deal today!\u0027 The boy laughed, grabbed the coins and ran. Ridcully walked on sedately, while the years fell back on him like snow. He found Ponder Stibbons pinning up a notice on the board just outside the Great Hall. He did this quite a lot. Ridcully assumed it made him feel better in some way. He slapped Ponder on the back, causing him to spill drawing pins all over the flagstones. \u0027It is a bulletin from the Ankh Committee on Safety, Archchancellor,\u0027 said Ponder, scrabbling for the spinning, wayward pins. \u0027This is a university of magic, Stibbons. We have no business with safety. Just being a wizard is unsafe, and so it should be.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Archchancellor.\u0027 \u0027But I should pick up all those pins if I were you, you can\u0027t be too careful. Tell me-didn\u0027t we use to have a sports master here?\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir. Evans the Striped. He vanished about forty years ago, I believe.\u0027 \u0027Killed? It was dead men\u0027s shoes in those days, you know.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t imagine who would want his job. Apparently he evaporated while doing press-ups in the Great Hall one day.\u0027 \u0027Evaporated? What kind of death is that for a wizard? Any wizard would die of shame if he just evaporated. We always leave something behind, even if it\u0027s only smoke. Oh, well. Cometh the hour, cometh the... whatever. General comethness, perhaps. What is that thinking engine of yours doing these days?\u0027 Ponder brightened. \u0027As a matter of fact, Archchancellor, Hex has just discovered a new particle. It travels faster than light in two directions at once!\u0027 \u0027Can we make it do anything interesting?\u0027 \u0027Well yes! It totally explodes Spolwhittle\u0027s Trans-Congruency Theory!\u0027 \u0027Good,\u0027 said Ridcully cheerfully. \u0027Just so long as something explodes. Since it\u0027s finished exploding, set it to finding either Evans or a decent substitute. Sports masters are pretty elementary particles, it shouldn\u0027t be difficult. And call a meeting of the Council in ten minutes. We are going to play football!\u0027 Truth is female, since truth is beauty rather than handsomeness; this, Ridcully reflected as the Council grumbled in, would certainly explain the saying that a lie could run around the world before Truth has got its, correction, her boots on, since she would have to choose which pair�Cthe idea that any woman in a position to choose would have just one pair of boots being beyond rational belief. Indeed, as a goddess she would have lots of shoes, and thus many choices: comfy shoes for home truths, hobnail boots for unpleasant truths, simple clogs for universal truths and possibly some kind of slipper for self-evident truth. More important right now was what kind of truth he was going to have to impart to his colleagues, and he decided not on the whole truth, but instead on nothing but the truth, which dispensed with the need for honesty. \u0027Well, go on, then, what did he say?\u0027 \u0027He responded to reasoned argument.\u0027 \u0027He did? Where\u0027s the catch?\u0027 \u0027None. But he wants the rules to be more traditional.\u0027 \u0027Surely not! Gather they are practically prehistoric as it is!\u0027 \u0027And he wants the university to take the lead in all this, and quickly. Gentlemen, there is a game going to be played in about three hours\u0027 time. I suggest we observe it. And to this end, I will require you to wear... trousers.\u0027 After a while Ridcully took out his watch, which was one of the old-fashioned imp-driven ones and was reliably inaccurate. He flipped up the gold lid and stared patiently as the little creature pedalled the hands around. When the expostulating had not stopped after a minute and a half, he snapped the lid shut. The click had an effect that no amount of extra shouting could have achieved. \u0027Gentlemen,\u0027 he said gravely. \u0027We must partake of the game of the people�Cfrom whom, I might add, we derive. Has any of us, in the last few decades, even seen the game being played? I thought not. We should get outside more. Now, I\u0027m not asking you to do this for me, or even for the hundreds of people who work to provide us with a life in which discomfort so seldom rears its head. Yes, many other ugly heads have reared, it is true, but dinner has always beckoned. We are, fellow wizards, the city\u0027s last line of defence against all the horrors that can be thrown against it. However, none of them are as potentially dangerous as us. Yes, indeed. I don\u0027t know what might happen if wizards were really hungry. So do this, I implore you on this one occasion, for the sake of the cheeseboard.\u0027 There had been some nobler calls to arms in history, Ridcully would be the first to admit, but this one was well tailored to its target audience. There was some grumbling, but that was the same as saying that the sky was blue. \u0027What about lunch?\u0027 said the Lecturer in Recent Runes suspiciously. \u0027We\u0027ll eat early,\u0027 said Ridcully, \u0027and I am told that the pies at the game are just�Camazing.\u0027 Truth, in front of her huge walk-in wardrobe, selected black leather boots with stiletto heels for such a barefaced truth. Nutt was already waiting with a proud but worried look on his face when Glenda got in to the Night Kitchen. She didn\u0027t notice him at first, but she turned back from hanging her coat on its peg and there he was, holding a couple of dishes in front of him like shields. She almost had to shade her eyes because they gleamed so brightly. \u0027I hope this is all right,\u0027 said Nutt nervously. \u0027What have you done?\u0027 \u0027I plated them with silver, miss.\u0027 \u0027How did you do that?\u0027 \u0027Oh, there\u0027s all kinds of old stuff in the cellars and, well, I know how to do things. It won\u0027t cause trouble for anyone, will it?\u0027 Nutt added, looking suddenly anxious. Glenda wondered if it would. It shouldn\u0027t, but you could never be sure with Mrs Whitlow. Well, she could solve that problem by hiding them somewhere until they tarnished. \u0027It\u0027s kind of you to take the trouble. I generally have to chase people to get plates back. You are a real gentleman,\u0027 she said, and his face lit up like a sunrise. \u0027You are very kind,\u0027 he beamed, \u0027and a very handsome lady with your two enormous chests that indicate bountifulness and fecundity - \u0027 The morning air froze in one enormous block. He could tell he\u0027d said something wrong, but he had no idea what it was. Glenda looked around to see if anyone had heard, but the huge gloomy room was otherwise empty. She was always the first one in and the last one out. Then she said, \u0027Stay right there. Don\u0027t you dare move an inch! Not an inch! And don\u0027t steal any chickens!\u0027 she commanded as an afterthought. She should have trailed steam as she headed out of the room, her boots echoing on the flagstones. What a thing to come out with! Who did he think he was? Come to that, who did she think he was? And what did she think he was? The cellars and undercrofts of the university were a small city in themselves, and bakers and butchers turned to look as she clattered past. She didn\u0027t dare stop now; it would be too embarrassing. If you knew all the passages and stairs, and if they stayed still for five minutes, it was possible to get to just about anywhere in the university without going above ground. Probably none of the wizards knew the maze. Not many of them cared to know the dull details of domestic management. Hah, they thought the dinners turned up by magic! A small set of stone steps led up to the little door. Hardly anyone used it these days. The other girls wouldn\u0027t go in there. But Glenda would. Even after the very first time that she had, in response to the bell, delivered the midnight banana, or rather had failed to deliver it on account of running away screaming, she knew she\u0027d have to face it again. After all, we can\u0027t help how we\u0027re made, her mother had said, and nor can we help what a magical accident might turn us into through no fault of our own, as Mrs Whitlow had explained slightly more recently, when the screaming had stopped. And so Glenda had picked up the banana and had headed right back there. Now, of course, she was surprised that anyone might find it odd that the custodian of all the knowledge that could be was a reddish brown and generally hung several feet above his desk, and she was pretty certain that she knew at least fourteen meanings of the word \u0027ook\u0027. As it was daytime, the huge building beyond the little door was bustling, insofar as the word can be applied to a library. She headed towards the nearest lesser librarian, who failed to look the other way in time, and demanded: \u0027I need to see a dictionary of embarrassing words beginning with F!\u0027 His haughty glance softened somewhat when he realized she was a cook. Wizards always had a place in their hearts for cooks, because it was near their stomach. \u0027Ah, then I think Birdcatcher\u0027s Discomforting Misusage will be our friend here,\u0027 he said cheerfully, and led her to a lectern, where she spent several enlightening minutes before heading back the way she had come, a little wiser and a great deal more embarrassed. Nutt was still standing where she\u0027d told him to stand, and looked terrified. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t know what you meant,\u0027 she said, and thought: abundant, productive and fruitful. Well, yes, I can see how he got there, worse luck, but that\u0027s not me, not really me. I think. I hope. \u0027Um, it was kind of you to say that about me,\u0027 she said, \u0027but you should have used more appropriate language.\u0027 \u0027Ah, yes, I\u0027m so sorry,\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Mister Trev told me about this. I should not talk posh. I should have said that you have enormous t - \u0027 \u0027Just stop there, will you? Trevor Likely is teaching you elocution?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t tell me, I know this one... You mean talkin\u0027 proper?\u0027 said Nutt. \u0027Yes, and he\u0027s promised to take me to the football,\u0027 he added proudly. This led to some explanation, which only made Glenda gloomy. Trev was right, of course. People who didn\u0027t know long words tended to be edgy around people who did. That\u0027s why her male neighbours, like Mr Stollop and his mates, distrusted nearly everybody. Their wives, on the other hand, shared a much larger if somewhat specialized vocabulary owing to the cheap romantic novels that passed like contraband from scullery to washhouse, in every street. That\u0027s why Glenda knew \u0027elocution\u0027, \u0027torrid\u0027, \u0027boudoir\u0027 and \u0027reticule\u0027, although she wasn\u0027t too certain about \u0027reticule\u0027 and \u0027boudoir\u0027, and avoided using them, which in the general scheme of things was not hard. She was deeply suspicious about what a lady\u0027s boudoir might be, and certainly wasn\u0027t going to ask anybody, even in the Library, just in case they laughed. \u0027And he\u0027s going to take you to the football, is he? Mister Nutt, you will stand out like a diamond in a sweep\u0027s earhole!\u0027 Do not stand out from the crowd. There were so many things to remember! \u0027He says he will look after me,\u0027 said Nutt, hanging his head. \u0027Er, I was wondering who that nice young lady was who was in here last night,\u0027 he added desperately, as transparent as air. \u0027He asked you to ask me, right?\u0027 Lie. Stay safe. But Ladyship wasn\u0027t here! And the nice apple-pie lady was right here in front of him! It was too complicated! \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said meekly. And Glenda surprised herself. \u0027Her name is Juliet, and she lives bang next door to me so he\u0027d better not come round, okay? Juliet Stollop, see if he likes that.\u0027 \u0027You fear he will press his suit?\u0027 \u0027Her dad will press a lot more than that if he sees he\u0027s a Dimmer supporter!\u0027 Nutt looked blank, so she went on: \u0027Don\u0027t you know anything? Dimwell Old Pals? The football team? The Dollies are Dolly Sisters Football Club. Dollies hate the Dimmers, the Dimmers hate the Dollies! It\u0027s always been like that!\u0027 \u0027What could have caused such a difference between them?\u0027 \u0027What? There is no difference between them, not when you\u0027ve got past the colours! They\u0027re two teams, alike in villainy! Dolly Sisters wears white and black, Dimwell wears pink and green. It\u0027s all about football. Bloody, bloody, clogging, hacking, punching, gouging, silly football!\u0027 The bitterness in Glenda\u0027s voice would have soured cream. \u0027But you have a Dolly Sisters scarf!\u0027 \u0027When you live there, it\u0027s safer that way. Anyway, you have to support your own.\u0027 \u0027But is it not a game, like spillikins or halma or Thud?\u0027 \u0027No! It\u0027s more like war, but without the kindness and consideration!\u0027 \u0027Oh, dear. But war is not kind, is it?\u0027 said Nutt, bewilderment clouding his face. \u0027No!\u0027 \u0027Oh, I see. You were being ironic.\u0027 She gave him a sideways look. \u0027I might have been,\u0027 she conceded. \u0027You are an odd one, Mister Nutt. Where are you from, really?\u0027 The old panic contained again. Be harmless. Be helpful. Make friends. Lie. But how did you lie to friends? \u0027I must go,\u0027 he said, scurrying down the stone steps. \u0027Mister Trev will be waiting!\u0027 Nice but odd, Glenda thought, watching him leap down the steps. Clever, too. To spot my scarf on a hook ten yards away. The sound of a rattling tin can alerted Nutt to his boss\u0027s presence before he had even hurried through the old archway to the vats. The other habitu��s had paused in their work, which, frankly, given its usual snaillike progress, meant hardly any change at all, and were watching him listlessly. But they were watching, at least. Even Concrete looked vaguely alert, but Nutt saw a little dribble of brown in the corner of his mouth. Someone had been giving him iron filings again. The can shot up as Trev caught it with his boot, flew over his head, and then came back obliquely, as if rolling down an invisible slope, and landed in his waiting hand. There was a murmur of appreciation from the watchers and Concrete banged his hand on the table, which generally meant approval. \u0027What kept you, Gobbo? Chatting up Glenda, were you? You\u0027ve got no chance there, take it from me. Been there, tried that, oh yes. No chance, mate.\u0027 He threw a grubby bag towards Nutt. \u0027Get these on quick, else you\u0027ll stand out like a diamond in - \u0027 \u0027A sweep\u0027s earhole?\u0027 Nutt suggested. \u0027Yeah! You\u0027re gettin\u0027 it. Now don\u0027t hang about or we\u0027ll be late.\u0027 Nutt looked doubtfully at a long, a very long scarf in pink and green and a large yellow woolly hat with a pink bobble on it. \u0027Pull it down hard so it covers your ears,\u0027 Trev commanded. \u0027Get a move on!\u0027 \u0027Er... pink?\u0027 said Nutt doubtfully, holding up the scarf. \u0027What about it?\u0027 \u0027Well, isn\u0027t football a rough man\u0027s game? Whereas pink, if you will excuse me, is rather a... female colour?\u0027 Trev grinned. \u0027Yeah, that\u0027s right. Think about it. You are the clever one around here. And you can walk and think at the same time, I know that. Makes you stand out from the crowd in these parts.\u0027 \u0027Ah, I think I have it. The pink proclaims an almost belligerent masculinity, saying as it does: I am so masculine I can afford to tempt you to question it, giving me the opportunity to proclaim it anew by doing violence to you in response. I don\u0027t know if you have ever read Ofleberger\u0027s Die Wesentlichen Ungewissheiten Zugeh\u0026ouml;rig der Offenkundigen M\u0026auml;nnlichkeit?\u0027 Trev grabbed his shoulder and spun him round. \u0027Wot do you fink, Gobbo?\u0027 he said, his red face a couple of inches from Nutt\u0027s. \u0027Wot is your problem? Wot are you all about? You come out with ten-dollar words an\u0027 you lay \u0027em down like a man doin\u0027 a jigsaw! So how come you\u0027re down in the vats, eh, workin\u0027 for someone like me? It don\u0027t make sense! Are you on the run from the Old Sam? No problem, there, unless you did up an old lady or somethin\u0027, but you got to tell me!\u0027 Too dangerous, thought Nutt desperately. Change the subject! \u0027She\u0027s called Juliet!\u0027 he gasped. \u0027The girl you asked about! She lives next door to Glenda! Honestly!\u0027 Trev looked suspicious. \u0027Glenda told you that?\u0027 \u0027Yes!\u0027 \u0027She was windin\u0027 you up. She knew you\u0027d tell me.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think she would lie to me, Mister Trev. She is my friend.\u0027 \u0027I kept thinkin\u0027 about her all last night,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027Well, she is a wonderful cook,\u0027 Nutt agreed. \u0027I meant Juliet!\u0027 \u0027Um, and Glenda said to tell you that Juliet\u0027s other name is Stollop,\u0027 said Nutt, hating to be the bearer of worse news. \u0027What? That girl is a Stollop?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Glenda said I was to see how you liked that, but I know the meaning of irony.\u0027 \u0027But it\u0027s like findin\u0027 a strawberry in a dogmeat stew, yeah? I mean, the Stollops are buggers, the lot of \u0027em, biters and cloggers to a man, the kind of bastards who\u0027ll kick your family jewels up into your throat.\u0027 \u0027But you don\u0027t play football, do you? You just watch.\u0027 \u0027Damn right! But I\u0027m a Face, right? I\u0027m known in all the boroughs. You can ask anyone. Everyone knows Trev Likely. I\u0027m Dave Likely\u0027s lad. Every supporter in the city knows about him. Four goals! No one else scored that much in a lifetime! And gave as good as he got, did Dad. One game he picked up the Dolly bastard holding the ball and threw \u0027im over the line. He gave as good as \u0027e got, my dad, and then some.\u0027 \u0027So, he was a bugger and a clogger and a biter too, was he?\u0027 \u0027What? Are you pulling my tonker?\u0027 \u0027I would not wish to do so initially, Mister Trev,\u0027 said Nutt, so solemnly that Trev had to grin, \u0027but, you see, if he fought the opposing team with even more force than they used, does that not mean that he - \u0027 \u0027He was my dad,\u0027 said Trev. \u0027That means you don\u0027t try any fancy maths, okay?\u0027 \u0027Okay indeed. And you never wanted to follow in his footsteps?\u0027 \u0027What, and get brung home on a stretcher? I got my brains from my ol\u0027 mum, not from Dad. He was a good bloke and loved his football, but he wasn\u0027t flush with brains to start with an\u0027 on that day some of \u0027em were leakin\u0027 out of his ear. The Dollies got \u0027im in the melee and sorted \u0027im out good and proper. That\u0027s not for me, Gobbo. I\u0027m smart.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Mister Trev, I can see that.\u0027 \u0027Get the gear on and let\u0027s go, okay? We don\u0027t want to miss anything.\u0027 \u0027Fing,\u0027 said Nutt automatically, as he started to wind the huge scarf around his neck. \u0027What?\u0027 said Trev, frowning. \u0027Wot?\u0027 said Nutt, his voice a little muffled. There was a lot of scarf. It was almost covering his mouth. \u0027Are you pulling my chuff, Gobbo?\u0027 said Trev, handing him an ancient sweater, faded and saggy with age. \u0027Please, Mister Trev, I don\u0027t know! There appears to be so much I might inadvertently pull!\u0027 He tugged on the big woolly hat with the pink pompom on it. \u0027They are so very pink, Mister Trev. We must be bursting with machismo!\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know what you person\u0027ly are bursting with, Gobbo, but here\u0027s somethin\u0027 to learn. \"Come on if you think you\u0027re hard enough.\" Now you say it.\u0027 \u0027Come on if you think you\u0027re hard enough,\u0027 said Nutt obediently. \u0027Well, okay,\u0027 said Trev, inspecting him. \u0027Just remember, if anyone starts pushing you around during the game, and givin\u0027 you grief, just you say that to \u0027em and they\u0027ll see you\u0027re wearing the Dimmer colours and they\u0027ll think twice. Got it?\u0027 Nutt, somewhere in the space between the big bobbly hat and the boa constrictor of a scarf, nodded. \u0027Wow, there you are, Gobbo, a complete... fan. Your own mother wouldn\u0027t recognize you!\u0027 There was a pause before a voice emerged from inside the mound of ancient woollens, which looked very much like a nursery layette made by a couple of giants who weren\u0027t sure what to expect. \u0027I believe you are accurate.\u0027 \u0027Yeah? Well, that\u0027s good, innit? Now let\u0027s go and meet the lads. Move fast, stay close.\u0027 \u0027Now remember, this is a pre-season friendly between the Angels and the Whoppers, right?\u0027 said Trev, as they stepped out into a fine rain which, because of Ankh-Morpork\u0027s standing cloud of pollution, was morphing gently into smog. \u0027They\u0027re both pretty crap, they\u0027ll never amount to anythin\u0027, but the Dimmers shout for the Angels, right?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37/page-3.html","bookId":1621,"book":{"id":1621,"title":"Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37)","description":"Storyline: Unseen Academicals (Discworld #37) The wizards at Ankh-Morpork\u0027s Unseen University are renowned for many things—wisdom, magic, and their love of teatime—but athletics is most assuredly not on the list. And so when Lord Vetinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .). As the big match approaches, these four lives are entangled and changed forever. Because the thing about football—the most important thing about football—is that it is never just about football.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/unseen-academicals-discworld-37.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:22 PM"}}
