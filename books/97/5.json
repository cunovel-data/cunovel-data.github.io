{"id":2448,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5:1 [hgb] 风 闻 在 你 们 中 间 有 淫 乱 的 事 。 这 样 的 淫 乱 ， 连 外 邦 人 中 也 没 有 ， 就 是 有 人 收 了 他 的 继 母 。 [kjv] It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father\u0027s wife. [bbe] It is said, in fact, that there is among you a sin of the flesh, such as is not seen even among the Gentiles, that one of you has his father\u0027s wife. 5:2 [hgb] 你 们 还 是 自 高 自 大 ， 并 不 哀 痛 ， 把 行 这 事 的 人 从 你 们 中 间 赶 出 去 。 [kjv] And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. [bbe] And in place of feeling sorrow, you are pleased with yourselves, so that he who has done this thing has not been sent away from among you. 5:3 [hgb] 我 身 子 虽 不 在 你 们 那 里 ， 心 却 在 你 们 那 里 ， 好 像 我 亲 自 与 你 们 同 在 ， 已 经 判 断 了 行 这 事 的 人 ， [kjv] For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, [bbe] For I myself, being present in spirit though not in body, have come to a decision about him who has done this thing; 5:4 [hgb] 就 是 你 们 聚 会 的 时 候 ， 我 的 心 也 同 在 ， 奉 我 们 主 耶 稣 的 名 ， 并 用 我 们 主 耶 稣 的 权 能 ， [kjv] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, [bbe] In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you have come together with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 5:5 [hgb] 要 把 这 样 的 人 交 给 撒 但 ， 败 坏 他 的 肉 体 ， 使 他 的 灵 魂 在 主 耶 稣 的 日 子 可 以 得 救 。 [kjv] To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. [bbe] That this man is to be handed over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may have forgiveness in the day of the Lord Jesus. 5:6 [hgb] 你 们 这 自 夸 是 不 好 的 。 岂 不 知 一 点 面 酵 能 使 全 团 发 起 来 吗 ？ [kjv] Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? [bbe] This pride of yours is not good. Do you not see that a little leaven makes a change in all the mass? 5:7 [hgb] 你 们 既 是 无 酵 的 面 ， 应 当 把 旧 酵 除 净 ， 好 使 你 们 成 为 新 团 。 因 为 我 们 逾 越 节 的 羔 羊 基 督 已 经 被 杀 献 祭 了 。 [kjv] Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: [bbe] Take away, then, the old leaven, so that you may be a new mass, even as you are without leaven. For Christ has been put to death as our Passover. 5:8 [hgb] 所 以 ， 我 们 守 这 节 不 可 用 旧 酵 ， 也 不 可 用 恶 毒 （ 或 作 阴 毒 ） ， 邪 恶 的 酵 ， 只 用 诚 实 真 正 的 无 酵 饼 。 [kjv] Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. [bbe] Let us then keep the feast, not with old leaven, and not with the leaven of evil thoughts and acts, but with the unleavened bread of true thoughts and right feelings. 5:9 [hgb] 我 先 前 写 信 给 你 们 说 ， 不 可 与 淫 乱 的 人 相 交 。 [kjv] I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: [bbe] In my letter I said to you that you were not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh; 5:10 [hgb] 此 话 不 是 指 这 世 上 一 概 行 淫 乱 的 ， 或 贪 婪 的 ， 勒 索 的 ， 或 拜 偶 像 的 ， 若 是 这 样 ， 你 们 除 非 离 开 世 界 方 可 。 [kjv] Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. [bbe] But I had not in mind the sinners who are outside the church, or those who have a desire for and take the property of others, or those who give worship to images; for it is not possible to keep away from such people without going out of the world completely: 5:11 [hgb] 但 如 今 我 写 信 给 你 们 说 ， 若 有 称 为 弟 兄 ， 是 行 淫 乱 的 ， 或 贪 婪 的 ， 或 拜 偶 像 的 ， 或 辱 骂 的 ， 或 醉 酒 的 ， 或 勒 索 的 。 这 样 的 人 不 可 与 他 相 交 。 就 是 与 他 吃 饭 都 不 可 。 [kjv] But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. [bbe] But the sense of my letter was that if a brother had the name of being one who went after the desires of the flesh, or had the desire for other people\u0027s property, or was in the way of using violent language, or being the worse for drink, or took by force what was not his, you might not keep company with such a one, or take food with him. 5:12 [hgb] 因 为 审 判 教 外 的 人 与 我 何 干 。 教 内 的 人 岂 不 是 你 们 审 判 的 吗 ？ [kjv] For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? [bbe] For it is no business of mine to be judging those who are outside; but it is yours to be judging those who are among you; 5:13 [hgb] 至 于 外 人 有 神 审 判 他 们 。 你 们 应 当 把 那 恶 人 从 你 们 中 间 赶 出 去 。 [kjv] But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person. [bbe] As for those who are outside, God is their judge. So put away the evil man from among you.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/163/2243.html","bookId":97,"book":{"id":97,"title":"哥林多前书 1 Corinthians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 奉 神 旨 意 ， 蒙 召 作 耶 稣 基 督 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， 同 兄 弟 所 提 尼 ， [kjv] Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/163","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
