{"id":2453,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"10:1 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 不 愿 意 你 们 不 晓 得 ， 我 们 的 祖 宗 从 前 都 在 云 下 ， 都 从 海 中 经 过 。 [kjv] Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; [bbe] For it is my desire, my brothers, that you may keep in mind how all our fathers were under the cloud, and they all went through the sea; 10:2 [hgb] 都 在 云 里 海 里 受 洗 归 了 摩 西 。 [kjv] And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; [bbe] And they all had baptism from Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 10:3 [hgb] 并 且 都 吃 了 一 样 的 灵 食 。 [kjv] And did all eat the same spiritual meat; [bbe] And they all took the same holy food; 10:4 [hgb] 也 都 喝 了 一 样 的 灵 水 。 所 喝 的 是 出 于 随 着 他 们 的 灵 磐 石 。 那 磐 石 就 是 基 督 。 [kjv] And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. [bbe] And the same holy drink: for they all took of the water from the holy rock which came after them: and the rock was Christ. 10:5 [hgb] 但 他 们 中 间 ， 多 半 是 神 不 喜 欢 的 人 。 所 以 在 旷 野 倒 毙 。 [kjv] But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. [bbe] But with most of them God was not pleased: for they came to their end in the waste land. 10:6 [hgb] 这 些 事 都 是 我 们 的 鉴 戒 ， 叫 我 们 不 要 贪 恋 恶 事 ， 像 他 们 那 样 贪 恋 的 。 [kjv] Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. [bbe] Now these things were for an example to us, so that our hearts might not go after evil things, as they did. 10:7 [hgb] 也 不 要 拜 偶 像 ， 像 他 们 有 人 拜 的 。 如 经 上 所 记 ， 百 姓 坐 下 吃 喝 ， 起 来 玩 耍 。 [kjv] Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. [bbe] Then do not go after false gods, as some of them did; as it is said in the holy Writings, After resting and feasting, the people got up to take their pleasure. 10:8 [hgb] 我 们 也 不 要 行 奸 淫 ， 像 他 们 有 人 行 的 ， 一 天 就 倒 毙 了 二 万 三 千 人 。 [kjv] Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. [bbe] Again, let us not give way to the desires of the flesh, as some of them did, of whom twenty-three thousand came to their end in one day. 10:9 [hgb] 也 不 要 试 探 主 ， （ 主 有 古 卷 作 基 督 ） 像 他 们 有 人 试 探 的 ， 就 被 蛇 所 灭 。 [kjv] Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. [bbe] And let us not put the Lord to the test, as some of them did, and came to their death by snakes. 10:10 [hgb] 你 们 也 不 要 发 怨 言 ， 像 他 们 有 发 怨 言 的 ， 就 被 灭 命 的 所 灭 。 [kjv] Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. [bbe] And do not say evil things against the Lord, as some of them did, and destruction overtook them. 10:11 [hgb] 他 们 遭 遇 这 些 事 ， 都 要 作 为 鉴 戒 。 并 且 写 在 经 上 ， 正 是 警 戒 我 们 这 末 世 的 人 。 [kjv] Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. [bbe] Now these things were done as an example; and were put down in writing for our teaching, on whom the last days have come. 10:12 [hgb] 所 以 自 己 以 为 站 得 稳 的 ， 须 要 谨 慎 ， 免 得 跌 倒 。 [kjv] Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. [bbe] So let him who seems to himself to be safe go in fear of a fall. 10:13 [hgb] 你 们 所 遇 见 的 试 探 ， 无 非 是 人 所 能 受 的 。 神 是 信 实 的 ， 必 不 叫 你 们 受 试 探 过 于 所 能 受 的 。 在 受 试 探 的 时 候 ， 总 要 给 你 们 开 一 条 出 路 ， 叫 你 们 能 忍 受 得 住 。 [kjv] There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. [bbe] You have been put to no test but such as is common to man: and God is true, who will not let any test come on you which you are not able to undergo; but he will make with the test a way out of it, so that you may be able to go through it. 10:14 [hgb] 我 所 亲 爱 的 弟 兄 阿 ， 你 们 要 逃 避 拜 偶 像 的 事 。 [kjv] Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. [bbe] For this cause, my dear brothers, give no worship to false gods. 10:15 [hgb] 我 好 像 对 明 白 人 说 的 ， 你 们 要 审 察 我 的 话 。 [kjv] I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. [bbe] What I am saying is for wise men, do you be the judges of it. 10:16 [hgb] 我 们 所 祝 福 的 杯 ， 岂 不 是 同 领 基 督 的 血 吗 ？ 我 们 所 掰 开 的 饼 ， 岂 不 是 同 领 基 督 的 身 体 吗 ？ [kjv] The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? [bbe] The cup of blessing which we take, does it not give us a part in the blood of Christ? and is not the broken bread a taking part in the body of Christ? 10:17 [hgb] 我 们 虽 多 ， 仍 是 一 个 饼 ， 一 个 身 体 。 因 为 我 们 都 是 分 受 这 一 个 饼 。 [kjv] For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. [bbe] Because we, being a number of persons, are one bread, we are one body: for we all take part in the one bread. 10:18 [hgb] 你 们 看 属 肉 体 的 以 色 列 人 。 那 吃 祭 物 的 ， 岂 不 是 在 祭 坛 上 有 分 吗 ？ [kjv] Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? [bbe] See Israel after the flesh: do not those who take as food the offerings of the altar take a part in the altar? 10:19 [hgb] 我 是 怎 么 说 呢 ？ 岂 是 说 祭 偶 像 之 物 算 得 什 么 呢 ？ 或 说 偶 像 算 得 什 么 呢 ？ [kjv] What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? [bbe] Do I say, then, that what is offered to images is anything, or that the image is anything? 10:20 [hgb] 我 乃 是 说 ， 外 邦 人 所 献 的 祭 ， 是 祭 鬼 ， 不 是 祭 神 。 我 不 愿 意 你 们 与 鬼 相 交 。 [kjv] But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. [bbe] What I say is that the things offered by the Gentiles are offered to evil spirits and not to God; and it is not my desire for you to have any part with evil spirits. 10:21 [hgb] 你 们 不 能 喝 主 的 杯 ， 又 喝 鬼 的 杯 。 不 能 吃 主 的 筵 席 ， 又 吃 鬼 的 筵 席 。 [kjv] Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord\u0027s table, and of the table of devils. [bbe] It is not possible for you, at the same time, to take the cup of the Lord and the cup of evil spirits; you may not take part in the table of the Lord and the table of evil spirits. 10:22 [hgb] 我 们 可 惹 主 的 愤 恨 吗 ？ 我 们 比 他 还 有 能 力 吗 ？ [kjv] Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? [bbe] Or may we be the cause of envy to the Lord? are we stronger than he? 10:23 [hgb] 凡 事 都 可 行 。 但 不 都 有 益 处 。 凡 事 都 可 行 。 但 不 都 造 就 人 。 [kjv] All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. [bbe] We are free to do all things, but there are things which it is not wise to do. We are free to do all things, but not all things are for the common good. 10:24 [hgb] 无 论 何 人 ， 不 要 求 自 己 的 益 处 ， 乃 要 求 别 人 的 益 处 。 [kjv] Let no man seek his own, but every man another\u0027s wealth. [bbe] Let a man give attention not only to what is good for himself, but equally to his neighbour\u0027s good. 10:25 [hgb] 凡 市 上 所 卖 的 ， 你 们 只 管 吃 ， 不 要 为 良 心 的 缘 故 问 什 么 话 。 [kjv] Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake: [bbe] Whatever meat may be had at the public market, take as food without question of right or wrong; 10:26 [hgb] 因 为 地 和 其 中 所 充 满 的 ， 都 属 乎 主 。 [kjv] For the earth is the Lord\u0027s, and the fulness thereof. [bbe] For the earth is the Lord\u0027s and all things in it. 10:27 [hgb] 倘 有 一 个 不 信 的 人 请 你 们 赴 席 ， 你 们 若 愿 意 去 ， 凡 摆 在 你 们 面 前 的 ， 只 管 吃 ， 不 要 为 良 心 的 缘 故 问 什 么 话 。 [kjv] If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. [bbe] If a Gentile makes a feast for you, and you are pleased to go as a guest, take whatever is put before you, without question of right or wrong. 10:28 [hgb] 若 有 人 对 你 们 说 ， 这 是 献 过 祭 的 物 ， 就 要 为 那 告 诉 你 们 的 人 ， 并 为 良 心 的 缘 故 ， 不 吃 。 [kjv] But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord\u0027s, and the fulness thereof: [bbe] But if anyone says to you, This food has been used as an offering, do not take it, on account of him who said it, and on account of his sense of right and wrong: 10:29 [hgb] 我 说 的 良 心 ， 不 是 你 的 ， 乃 是 他 的 。 我 这 自 由 ， 为 什 么 被 别 人 的 良 心 论 断 呢 ？ [kjv] Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man\u0027s conscience? [bbe] Right and wrong, I say, not for you, but for the other man; for the fact that I am free is not dependent on another man\u0027s sense of right or wrong. 10:30 [hgb] 我 若 谢 恩 而 吃 ， 为 什 么 因 我 谢 恩 的 物 被 人 毁 谤 呢 ？ [kjv] For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? [bbe] But if I give praise to God for the food which I take, let no man say evil of me for that reason. 10:31 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 或 吃 或 喝 ， 无 论 作 什 么 ， 都 要 为 荣 耀 神 而 行 。 [kjv] Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. [bbe] So then, if it is a question of food or drink, or any other thing, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 10:32 [hgb] 不 拘 是 犹 太 人 ， 是 希 利 尼 人 ， 是 神 的 教 会 ， 你 们 都 不 要 使 他 跌 倒 。 [kjv] Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: [bbe] Give no cause of trouble to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God. 10:33 [hgb] 就 好 像 我 凡 事 都 叫 众 人 喜 欢 ， 不 求 自 己 的 益 处 ， 只 求 众 人 的 益 处 ， 叫 他 们 得 救 。 [kjv] Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. [bbe] Even as I give way to all men in all things, not looking for profit for myself, but for the good of others, that they may get salvation.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/163/2248.html","bookId":97,"book":{"id":97,"title":"哥林多前书 1 Corinthians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 奉 神 旨 意 ， 蒙 召 作 耶 稣 基 督 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， 同 兄 弟 所 提 尼 ， [kjv] Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/163","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
