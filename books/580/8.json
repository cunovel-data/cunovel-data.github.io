{"id":22779,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"Connie took it in good part, even daffs for daffodils. Wild daffodils! After all, one could not stew in one\u0027s own juice. The spring came back...`Seasons return, but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of Ev\u0027n or Morn.\u0027 \n And the keeper, his thin, white body, like a lonely pistil of an invisible flower! She had forgotten him in her unspeakable depression. But now something roused...`Pale beyond porch and portal\u0027...the thing to do was to pass the porches and the portals. \n She was stronger, she could walk better, and iii the wood the wind would not be so tiring as it was across the bark, flatten against her. She wanted to forget, to forget the world, and all the dreadful, carrion-bodied people. `Ye must be born again! I believe in the resurrection of the body! Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it shall by no means bring forth. When the crocus cometh forth I too will emerge and see the sun!\u0027 In the wind of March endless phrases swept through her consciousness. \n Little gusts of sunshine blew, strangely bright, and lit up the celandines at the wood\u0027s edge, under the hazel-rods, they spangled out bright and yellow. And the wood was still, stiller, but yet gusty with crossing sun. The first windflowers were out, and all the wood seemed pale with the pallor of endless little anemones, sprinkling the shaken floor. `The world has grown pale with thy breath.\u0027 But it was the breath of Persephone, this time; she was out of hell on a cold morning. Cold breaths of wind came, and overhead there was an anger of entangled wind caught among the twigs. It, too, was caught and trying to tear itself free, the wind, like Absalom. How cold the anemones looked, bobbing their naked white shoulders over crinoline skirts of green. But they stood it. A few first bleached little primroses too, by the path, and yellow buds unfolding themselves. \n The roaring and swaying was overhead, only cold currents came down below. Connie was strangely excited in the wood, and the colour flew in her cheeks, and burned blue in her eyes. She walked ploddingly, picking a few primroses and the first violets, that smelled sweet and cold, sweet and cold. And she drifted on without knowing where she was. \n Till she came to the clearing, at the end of the wood, and saw the green-stained stone cottage, looking almost rosy, like the flesh underneath a mushroom, its stone warmed in a burst of sun. And there was a sparkle of yellow jasmine by the door; the closed door. But no sound; no smoke from the chimney; no dog barking. \n She went quietly round to the back, where the bank rose up; she had an excuse, to see the daffodils. \n And they were there, the short-stemmed flowers, rustling and fluttering and shivering, so bright and alive, but with nowhere to hide their faces, as they turned them away from the wind. \n They shook their bright, sunny little rags in bouts of distress. But perhaps they liked it really; perhaps they really liked the tossing. \n Constance sat down with her back to a young pine-tree, that wayed against her with curious life, elastic, and powerful, rising up. The erect, alive thing, with its top in the sun! And she watched the daffodils turn golden, in a burst of sun that was warm on her hands and lap. Even she caught the faint, tarry scent of the flowers. And then, being so still and alone, she seemed to bet into the current of her own proper destiny. She had been fastened by a rope, and jagging and snarring like a boat at its moorings; now she was loose and adrift. \n The sunshine gave way to chill; the daffodils were in shadow, dipping silently. So they would dip through the day and the long cold night. So strong in their frailty! \n She rose, a little stiff, took a few daffodils, and went down. She hated breaking the flowers, but she wanted just one or two to go with her. She would have to go back to Wragby and its walls, and now she hated it, especially its thick walls. Walls! Always walls! Yet one needed them in this wind. \n When she got home Clifford asked her: \n `Where did you go?\u0027 \n `Right across the wood! Look, aren\u0027t the little daffodils adorable? To think they should come out of the earth!\u0027 \n `Just as much out of air and sunshine,\u0027 he said. \n `But modelled in the earth,\u0027 she retorted, with a prompt contradiction, that surprised her a little. \n The next afternoon she went to the wood again. She followed the broad riding that swerved round and up through the larches to a spring called John\u0027s Well. It was cold on this hillside, and not a flower in the darkness of larches. But the icy little spring softly pressed upwards from its tiny well-bed of pure, reddish-white pebbles. How icy and clear it was! Brilliant! The new keeper had no doubt put in fresh pebbles. She heard the faint tinkle of water, as the tiny overflow trickled over and downhill. Even above the hissing boom of the larchwood, that spread its bristling, leafless, wolfish darkness on the down-slope, she heard the tinkle as of tiny water-bells. \n This place was a little sinister, cold, damp. Yet the well must have been a drinking-place for hundreds of years. Now no more. Its tiny cleared space was lush and cold and dismal. \n She rose and went slowly towards home. As she went she heard a faint tapping away on the right, and stood still to listen. Was it hammering, or a woodpecker? It was surely hammering. \n She walked on, listening. And then she noticed a narrow track between young fir-trees, a track that seemed to lead nowhere. But she felt it had been used. She turned down it adventurously, between the thick young firs, which gave way soon to the old oak wood. She followed the track, and the hammering grew nearer, in the silence of the windy wood, for trees make a silence even in their noise of wind. \n She saw a secret little clearing, and a secret little hot made of rustic poles. And she had never been here before! She realized it was the quiet place where the growing pheasants were reared; the keeper in his shirt-sleeves was kneeling, hammering. The dog trotted forward with a short, sharp bark, and the keeper lifted his face suddenly and saw her. He had a startled look in his eyes. \n He straightened himself and saluted, watching her in silence, as she came forward with weakening limbs. He resented the intrusion; he cherished his solitude as his only and last freedom in life. \n `I wondered what the hammering was,\u0027 she said, feeling weak and breathless, and a little afraid of him, as he looked so straight at her. \n `Ah\u0027m gettin\u0027 th\u0027 coops ready for th\u0027 young bods,\u0027 he said, in broad vernacular. \n She did not know what to say, and she felt weak. `I should like to sit down a bit,\u0027 she said. \n `Come and sit \u0027ere i\u0027 th\u0027 \u0027ut,\u0027 he said, going in front of her to the hut, pushing aside some timber and stuff, and drawing out a rustic chair, made of hazel sticks. \n `Am Ah t\u0027 light yer a little fire?\u0027 he asked, with the curious na?vet√© of the dialect. \n `Oh, don\u0027t bother,\u0027 she replied. \n But he looked at her hands; they were rather blue. So he quickly took some larch twigs to the little brick fire-place in the corner, and in a moment the yellow flame was running up the chimney. He made a place by the brick hearth. \n `Sit \u0027ere then a bit, and warm yer,\u0027 he said. \n She obeyed him. He had that curious kind of protective authority she obeyed at once. So she sat and warmed her hands at the blaze, and dropped logs on the fire, whilst outside he was hammering again. She did not really want to sit, poked in a corner by the fire; she would rather have watched from the door, but she was being looked after, so she had to submit. \n The hut was quite cosy, panelled with unvarnished deal, having a little rustic table and stool beside her chair, and a carpenter\u0027s bench, then a big box, tools, new boards, nails; and many things hung from pegs: axe, hatchet, traps, things in sacks, his coat. It had no window, the light came in through the open door. It was a jumble, but also it was a sort of little sanctuary. \n She listened to the tapping of the man\u0027s hammer; it was not so happy. He was oppressed. Here was a trespass on his privacy, and a dangerous one! A woman! He had reached the point where all he wanted on earth was to be alone. And yet he was powerless to preserve his privacy; he was a hired man, and these people were his masters. \n Especially he did not want to come into contact with a woman again. He feared it; for he had a big wound from old contacts. He felt if he could not be alone, and if he could not be left alone, he would die. His recoil away from the outer world was complete; his last refuge was this wood; to hide himself there! \n Connie grew warm by the fire, which she had made too big: then she grew hot. She went and sat on the stool in the doorway, watching the man at work. He seemed not to notice her, but he knew. Yet he worked on, as if absorbedly, and his brown dog sat on her tail near him, and surveyed the untrustworthy world. \n Slender, quiet and quick, the man finished the coop he was making, turned it over, tried the sliding door, then set it aside. Then he rose, went for an old coop, and took it to the chopping log where he was working. Crouching, he tried the bars; some broke in his hands; he began to draw the nails. Then he turned the coop over and deliberated, and he gave absolutely no sign of awareness of the woman\u0027s presence. \n So Connie watched him fixedly. And the same solitary aloneness she had seen in him naked, she now saw in him clothed: solitary, and intent, like an animal that works alone, but also brooding, like a soul that recoils away, away from all human contact. Silently, patiently, he was recoiling away from her even now. It was the stillness, and the timeless sort of patience, in a man impatient and passionate, that touched Connie\u0027s womb. She saw it in his bent head, the quick quiet hands, the crouching of his slender, sensitive loins; something patient and withdrawn. She felt his experience had been deeper and wider than her own; much deeper and wider, and perhaps more deadly. And this relieved her of herself; she felt almost irresponsible. \n So she sat in the doorway of the hut in a dream, utterly unaware of time and of particular circumstances. She was so drifted away that he glanced up at her quickly, and saw the utterly still, waiting look on her face. To him it was a look of waiting. And a little thin tongue of fire suddenly flickered in his loins, at the root of his back, and he groaned in spirit. He dreaded with a repulsion almost of death, any further close human contact. He wished above all things she would go away, and leave him to his own privacy. He dreaded her will, her female will, and her modern female insistency. And above all he dreaded her cool, upper-class impudence of having her own way. For after all he was only a hired man. He hated her presence there. \n Connie came to herself with sudden uneasiness. She rose. The afternoon was turning to evening, yet she could not go away. She went over to the man, who stood up at attention, his worn face stiff and blank, his eyes watching her. \n `It is so nice here, so restful,\u0027 she said. `I have never been here before.\u0027 \n `No?\u0027 \n `I think I shall come and sit here sometimes. \n `Yes?\u0027 \n `Do you lock the hut when you\u0027re not here?\u0027 \n `Yes, your Ladyship.\u0027 \n `Do you think I could have a key too, so that I could sit here sometimes? Are there two keys?\u0027 \n `Not as Ah know on, ther\u0027 isna.\u0027 \n He had lapsed into the vernacular. Connie hesitated; he was putting up an opposition. Was it his hut, after all? \n `Couldn\u0027t we get another key?\u0027 she asked in her soft voice, that underneath had the ring of a woman determined to get her way. \n `Another!\u0027 he said, glancing at her with a flash of anger, touched with derision. \n `Yes, a duplicate,\u0027 she said, flushing. \n `\u0027Appen Sir Clifford \u0027ud know,\u0027 he said, putting her off. \n `Yes!\u0027 she said, `he might have another. Otherwise we could have one made from the one you have. It would only take a day or so, I suppose. You could spare your key for so long.\u0027 \n `Ah canna tell yer, m\u0027Lady! Ah know nob\u0027dy as ma\u0027es keys round \u0027ere.\u0027 \n Connie suddenly flushed with anger. \n `Very well!\u0027 she said. `I\u0027ll see to it.\u0027 \n `All right, your Ladyship.\u0027 \n Their eyes met. His had a cold, ugly look of dislike and contempt, and indifference to what would happen. Hers were hot with rebuff. \n But her heart sank, she saw how utterly he disliked her, when she went against him. And she saw him in a sort of desperation. \n `Good afternoon!\u0027 \n `Afternoon, my Lady!\u0027 He saluted and turned abruptly away. She had wakened the sleeping dogs of old voracious anger in him, anger against the self-willed female. And he was powerless, powerless. He knew it! \n And she was angry against the self-willed male. A servant too! She walked sullenly home. \n She found Mrs Bolton under the great beech-tree on the knoll, looking for her. \n `I just wondered if you\u0027d be coming, my Lady,\u0027 the woman said brightly. \n `Am I late?\u0027 asked Connie. \n `Oh only Sir Clifford was waiting for his tea.\u0027 \n `Why didn\u0027t you make it then?\u0027 \n `Oh, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s hardly my place. I don\u0027t think Sir Clifford would like it at all, my Lady.\u0027 \n `I don\u0027t see why not,\u0027 said Connie. \n She went indoors to Clifford\u0027s study, where the old brass kettle was simmering on the tray. \n `Am I late, Clifford?\u0027 she said, putting down the few flowers and taking up the tea-caddy, as she stood before the tray in her hat and scarf. `I\u0027m sorry! Why didn\u0027t you let Mrs Bolton make the tea?\u0027 \n `I didn\u0027t think of it,\u0027 he said ironically. `I don\u0027t quite see her presiding at the tea-table.\u0027 \n `Oh, there\u0027s nothing sacrosanct about a silver tea-pot,\u0027 said Connie. \n He glanced up at her curiously. \n `What did you do all afternoon?\u0027 he said. \n `Walked and sat in a sheltered place. Do you know there are still berries on the big holly-tree?\u0027 \n She took off her scarf, but not her hat, and sat down to make tea. The toast would certainly be leathery. She put the tea-cosy over the tea-pot, and rose to get a little glass for her violets. The poor flowers hung over, limp on their stalks. \n `They\u0027ll revive again!\u0027 she said, putting them before him in their glass for him to smell. \n `Sweeter than the lids of Juno\u0027s eyes,\u0027 he quoted. \n `I don\u0027t see a bit of connexion with the actual violets,\u0027 she said. `The Elizabethans are rather upholstered.\u0027 \n She poured him his tea. \n `Do you think there is a second key to that little hut not far from John\u0027s Well, where the pheasants are reared?\u0027 she said. \n `There may be. Why?\u0027 \n `I happened to find it today---and I\u0027d never seen it before. I think it\u0027s a darling place. I could sit there sometimes, couldn\u0027t I?\u0027 \n `Was Mellors there?\u0027 \n `Yes! That\u0027s how I found it: his hammering. He didn\u0027t seem to like my intruding at all. In fact he was almost rude when I asked about a second key.\u0027 \n `What did he say?\u0027 \n `Oh, nothing: just his manner; and he said he knew nothing about keys.\u0027 \n `There may be one in Father\u0027s study. Betts knows them all, they\u0027re all there. I\u0027ll get him to look.\u0027 \n `Oh do!\u0027 she said. \n `So Mellors was almost rude?\u0027 \n `Oh, nothing, really! But I don\u0027t think he wanted me to have the freedom of the castle, quite.\u0027 \n `I don\u0027t suppose he did.\u0027 \n `Still, I don\u0027t see why he should mind. It\u0027s not his home, after all! It\u0027s not his private abode. I don\u0027t see why I shouldn\u0027t sit there if I want to.\u0027 \n `Quite!\u0027 said Clifford. `He thinks too much of himself, that man.\u0027 \n `Do you think he does?\u0027 \n `Oh, decidedly! He thinks he\u0027s something exceptional. You know he had a wife he didn\u0027t get on with, so he joined up in 1915 and was sent to India, I believe. Anyhow he was blacksmith to the cavalry in Egypt for a time; always was connected with horses, a clever fellow that way. Then some Indian colonel took a fancy to him, and he was made a lieutenant. Yes, they gave him a commission. I believe he went back to India with his colonel, and up to the north-west frontier. He was ill; he was a pension. He didn\u0027t come out of the army till last year, I believe, and then, naturally, it isn\u0027t easy for a man like that to get back to his own level. He\u0027s bound to flounder. But he does his duty all right, as far as I\u0027m concerned. Only I\u0027m not having any of the Lieutenant Mellors touch.\u0027 \n `How could they make him an officer when he speaks broad Derbyshire?\u0027 \n `He doesn\u0027t...except by fits and starts. He can speak perfectly well, for him. I suppose he has an idea if he\u0027s come down to the ranks again, he\u0027d better speak as the ranks speak.\u0027 \n `Why didn\u0027t you tell me about him before?\u0027 \n `Oh, I\u0027ve no patience with these romances. They\u0027re the ruin of all order. It\u0027s a thousand pities they ever happened.\u0027 \n Connie was inclined to agree. What was the good of discontented people who fitted in nowhere? \n In the spell of fine weather Clifford, too, decided to go to the wood. The wind was cold, but not so tiresome, and the sunshine was like life itself, warm and full. \n `It\u0027s amazing,\u0027 said Connie, `how different one feels when there\u0027s a really fresh fine day. Usually one feels the very air is half dead. People are killing the very air.\u0027 \n `Do you think people are doing it?\u0027 he asked. \n `I do. The steam of so much boredom, and discontent and anger out of all the people, just kills the vitality in the air. I\u0027m sure of it.\u0027 \n `Perhaps some condition of the atmosphere lowers the vitality of the people?\u0027 he said. \n `No, it\u0027s man that poisons the universe,\u0027 she asserted. \n `Fouls his own nest,\u0027 remarked Clifford. \n The chair puffed on. In the hazel copse catkins were hanging pale gold, and in sunny places the wood-anemones were wide open, as if exclaiming with the joy of life, just as good as in past days, when people could exclaim along with them. They had a faint scent of apple-blossom. Connie gathered a few for Clifford. \n He took them and looked at them curiously. \n `Thou still unravished bride of quietness,\u0027 he quoted. `It seems to fit flowers so much better than Greek vases.\u0027 \n `Ravished is such a horrid word!\u0027 she said. `It\u0027s only people who ravish things.\u0027 \n `Oh, I don\u0027t know...snails and things,\u0027 he said. \n `Even snails only eat them, and bees don\u0027t ravish.\u0027 \n She was angry with him, turning everything into words. Violets were Juno\u0027s eyelids, and windflowers were on ravished brides. How she hated words, always coming between her and life: they did the ravishing, if anything did: ready-made words and phrases, sucking all the life-sap out of living things. \n The walk with Clifford was not quite a success. Between him and Connie there was a tension that each pretended not to notice, but there it was. Suddenly, with all the force of her female instinct, she was shoving him off. She wanted to be clear of him, and especially of his consciousness, his words, his obsession with himself, his endless treadmill obsession with himself, and his own words. \n The weather came rainy again. But after a day or two she went out in the rain, and she went to the wood. And once there, she went towards the hut. It was raining, but not so cold, and the wood felt so silent and remote, inaccessible in the dusk of rain. \n She came to the clearing. No one there! The hut was locked. But she sat on the log doorstep, under the rustic porch, and snuggled into her own warmth. So she sat, looking at the rain, listening to the many noiseless noises of it, and to the strange soughings of wind in upper branches, when there seemed to be no wind. Old oak-trees stood around, grey, powerful trunks, rain-blackened, round and vital, throwing off reckless limbs. The ground was fairly free of undergrowth, the anemones sprinkled, there was a bush or two, elder, or guelder-rose, and a purplish tangle of bramble: the old russet of bracken almost vanished under green anemone ruffs. Perhaps this was one of the unravished places. Unravished! The whole world was ravished. \n Some things can\u0027t be ravished. You can\u0027t ravish a tin of sardines. And so many women are like that; and men. But the earth...! \n The rain was abating. It was hardly making darkness among the oaks any more. Connie wanted to go; yet she sat on. But she was getting cold; yet the overwhelming inertia of her inner resentment kept her there as if paralysed. \n Ravished! How ravished one could be without ever being touched. Ravished by dead words become obscene, and dead ideas become obsessions. \n A wet brown dog came running and did not bark, lifting a wet feather of a tail. The man followed in a wet black oilskin jacket, like a chauffeur, and face flushed a little. She felt him recoil in his quick walk, when he saw her. She stood up in the handbreadth of dryness under the rustic porch. He saluted without speaking, coming slowly near. She began to withdraw. \n `I\u0027m just going,\u0027 she said. \n `Was yer waitin\u0027 to get in?\u0027 he asked, looking at the hut, not at her. \n `No, I only sat a few minutes in the shelter,\u0027 she said, with quiet dignity. \n He looked at her. She looked cold. \n `Sir Clifford \u0027adn\u0027t got no other key then?\u0027 he asked. \n `No, but it doesn\u0027t matter. I can sit perfectly dry under this porch. Good afternoon!\u0027 She hated the excess of vernacular in his speech. \n He watched her closely, as she was moving away. Then he hitched up his jacket, and put his hand in his breeches pocket, taking out the key of the hut. \n `\u0027Appen yer\u0027d better \u0027ave this key, an\u0027 Ah min fend for t\u0027 bods some other road.\u0027 \n She looked at him. \n `What do you mean?\u0027 she asked. \n `I mean as \u0027appen Ah can find anuther pleece as\u0027ll du for rearin\u0027 th\u0027 pheasants. If yer want ter be \u0027ere, yo\u0027ll non want me messin\u0027 abaht a\u0027 th\u0027 time.\u0027 \n She looked at him, getting his meaning through the fog of the dialect. \n `Why don\u0027t you speak ordinary English?\u0027 she said coldly. \n `Me! Ah thowt it wor ordinary.\u0027 \n She was silent for a few moments in anger. \n `So if yer want t\u0027 key, yer\u0027d better tacit. Or \u0027appen Ah\u0027d better gi\u0027e \u0027t yer termorrer, an\u0027 clear all t\u0027 stuff aht fust. Would that du for yer?\u0027 \n She became more angry. \n `I didn\u0027t want your key,\u0027 she said. `I don\u0027t want you to clear anything out at all. I don\u0027t in the least want to turn you out of your hut, thank you! I only wanted to be able to sit here sometimes, like today. But I can sit perfectly well under the porch, so please say no more about it.\u0027 \n He looked at her again, with his wicked blue eyes. \n `Why,\u0027 he began, in the broad slow dialect. `Your Ladyship\u0027s as welcome as Christmas ter th\u0027 hut an\u0027 th\u0027 key an\u0027 iverythink as is. On\u0027y this time O\u0027 th\u0027 year ther\u0027s bods ter set, an\u0027 Ah\u0027ve got ter be potterin\u0027 abaht a good bit, seein\u0027 after \u0027em, an\u0027 a\u0027. Winter time Ah ned \u0027ardly come nigh th\u0027 pleece. But what wi\u0027 spring, an\u0027 Sir Clifford wantin\u0027 ter start th\u0027 pheasants...An\u0027 your Ladyship\u0027d non want me tinkerin\u0027 around an\u0027 about when she was \u0027ere, all the time.\u0027 \n She listened with a dim kind of amazement. \n `Why should I mind your being here?\u0027 she asked. \n He looked at her curiously. \n `T\u0027nuisance on me!\u0027 he said briefly, but significantly. She flushed. `Very well!\u0027 she said finally. `I won\u0027t trouble you. But I don\u0027t think I should have minded at all sitting and seeing you look after the birds. I should have liked it. But since you think it interferes with you, I won\u0027t disturb you, don\u0027t be afraid. You are Sir Clifford\u0027s keeper, not mine.\u0027 \n The phrase sounded queer, she didn\u0027t know why. But she let it pass. \n `Nay, your Ladyship. It\u0027s your Ladyship\u0027s own \u0027ut. It\u0027s as your Ladyship likes an\u0027 pleases, every time. Yer can turn me off at a wik\u0027s notice. It wor only...\u0027 \n `Only what?\u0027 she asked, baffled. \n He pushed back his hat in an odd comic way. \n `On\u0027y as \u0027appen yo\u0027d like the place ter yersen, when yer did come, an\u0027 not me messin\u0027 abaht.\u0027 \n `But why?\u0027 she said, angry. `Aren\u0027t you a civilized human being? Do you think I ought to be afraid of you? Why should I take any notice of you and your being here or not? Why is it important?\u0027 \n He looked at her, all his face glimmering with wicked laughter. \n `It\u0027s not, your Ladyship. Not in the very least,\u0027 he said. \n `Well, why then?\u0027 she asked. \n `Shall I get your Ladyship another key then?\u0027 \n `No thank you! I don\u0027t want it.\u0027 \n `Ah\u0027ll get it anyhow. We\u0027d best \u0027ave two keys ter th\u0027 place.\u0027 \n `And I consider you are insolent,\u0027 said Connie, with her colour up, panting a little. \n `Nay, nay!\u0027 he said quickly. `Dunna yer say that! Nay, nay! I niver meant nuthink. Ah on\u0027y thought as if yo\u0027 come \u0027ere, Ah s\u0027d ave ter clear out, an\u0027 it\u0027d mean a lot of work, settin\u0027 up somewheres else.

She was not sure whether she had been insulted and mortally of fended, or not. Perhaps the man really only meant what he said; that he thought she would expect him to keep away. As if she would dream of it! And as if he could possibly be so important, he and his stupid presence. \n She went home in confusion, not knowing what she thought or felt. \n
