She said, “What happened?” I stood there with my mouth open as she tried to hug Asher, but he just ran right by her and into his room. I’d never been so confused. I couldn’t even explain what had happened to my parents, because I had no idea. You’d think they would have called Mrs. Beal and asked a bunch of questions, but I don’t think they did, and I remember my dad saying, “Boys fight at that age. Just part of growing up,” to Linda, who was more concerned with how ugly my black eye appeared than the reason for Asher’s freak-out. Asher didn’t come to school for a few days, and then he just showed up at my house late one afternoon, and said, “Can we talk?” “Sure,” I said. My dad and Linda weren’t home. We went up into my room and he started pacing like a caged animal. I had never seen him pace like that before. “I’m sorry I fucked up our project,” he said. “It’s okay.” I didn’t really care about failing or anything like that, but what he had done to me definitely wasn’t okay, and I knew it. Why did I say it was okay? I should have said, “Why the hell did you punch me? What the fuck is wrong with you?” But I didn’t. I wish I had. Maybe if I had gotten angry… “Something happened on the fishing trip,” he said. He looked at me in this crazy way. He looked so desperate. But then he broke eye contact, said, “Never mind. I have to go,” and walked out of my room. I was so confused that I let him walk away without saying a word. I know now that I should have chased him, asked again what was wrong, promised to help him, or—at the very least—I should have told someone that Asher was acting weird, but I was afraid of that desperate look. I didn’t want Asher to punch me again—and I was just a kid. How was I supposed to know what to do? The next day, Asher returned to school and really appeared to be okay. For a while everything seemed to go back to normal. Our teacher even let us redo our Machu Picchu model for three-quarters credit, which we accomplished in half the time it took us to build the original. But then Asher started picking fights with kids at school who were small and quiet. He started to make fun of me during lunch periods—saying crazy weird stuff like he caught me jerking off to a picture of his mom, or that I tried to grab his dick in the locker room—and he was always trying to trip me in the halls and pushing me into lockers. I didn’t like it at all, but I didn’t say anything. Why? I should have said something—not just to stick up for myself, but because I think Asher wanted me to save him. Like maybe he wanted me to make it stop the whole time and on some subconscious level he was pushing me to get so fucking angry that I would finally tell the adults in our lives that he needed help. I wonder now if all of what happened afterward—the bullying and then the really bad shit—was his way of punishing me for failing to protect him. When I finally stood up for myself—when he stopped with me—I knew there would be others. What if I had the power to save both of us—all of us—all along? I need to take care of what I should have taken care of a long time ago. I need to make it stop permanently. TWENTY-EIGHT My target suddenly makes an appearance in Mrs. Beal Makes Her Perverted Son His Last Meal—there he is on the kitchen’s bay-window drive-in movie screen. I start to sweat. Enemy collateral target known as “Asher’s mother” gives the primary target a kiss on the cheek. Primary target says something before disappearing. Primary target looks like the all-American next-door boy in the movie—like the kid you’d pick to take your daughter to the prom. The dutiful-son lie plastered all over that drive-in movie screen gets my heart pumping machine-gun blood drops that race through my veins as I turn the P-38 safety off with my thumb, and finger the trigger.62 Every inch of my skin is slick with sweat, even though it’s probably less than forty degrees out. A minute ago I was shivering, but now I fight an urge to take off my shirt—that’s how hot I feel. It’s like I swallowed the sun. Primary target’s bedroom light comes on a second later, which is supposed to be my cue to move and put the plan into action, but my feet remain rooted to the ground. Primary target flicks on his computer and his face glows like an alien. Kill the alien, I think. Remember what he did to you. You have every right. He’s not human. He’s a thing. A target. Remember to use your military training—what you gleaned from the Internet. I leave my body and my essence floats up maybe fifteen feet above my head so that I am looking down on the flesh and bones and blood—the matter—I used to inhabit. I can’t see my expression because of the Bogart hat, but my right arm is outstretched and the P-38 is pointed at the primary target. My legs don’t walk, but I start to glide across the backyard, through the darkness, light as a ghost. I look like a rigid lowercase r being pulled across ice. What’s pulling me? I think, as I hover through the stiff winter air looking down, which is when I realize my essence is being pulled too—I’m sort of following my flesh like a helium birthday balloon tied to a little kid’s wrist.63 I’m standing in the target’s window now, remembering what he did to me in that very bedroom so many times. How confused I felt. How I wanted it to stop. How he intimidated me. How he psychologically tricked me. How he said if I stopped doing what we were doing he’d tell people in great detail all about what we had done together and then everyone would call me a faggot and maybe even beat the shit out of me. People would believe him and not me, when he said I made him do it. And how if I stopped doing what he wanted me to do he’d post the video he secretly made of us with his computer camera that I didn’t know was on. The first time, he said his uncle had shown him how to feel good in a way I wouldn’t believe. I wanted to feel good. Who doesn’t? We were almost twelve. We were wrestling WWE-style. Just messing around. I had this ski mask I’d wear and pretend I was Rey Mysterio. He was always John Cena. And then we weren’t wrestling. We were doing something I didn’t understand—something exciting, dangerous. Something I wasn’t ready for—something I didn’t really want. We were pretending—or were we? Then Asher wanted to wrestle all the time. I started asking questions—trying to figure out what was happening. Asher told me not to ask questions—to keep what happened between us, not to think about it too much—and he looked mean when he said it, like someone I didn’t know, not like a friend at all. The more it happened, the less friendly he got. It went on for two years. I didn’t want to lose my friend. Haven’t you ever done things you didn’t want to do just to keep a friend? I tried to avoid Asher’s bedroom—being alone with Asher period—but he was persistent, always asking me to wrestle, which became the code word. Then I just started making up excuses—telling Asher I couldn’t hang out because I had homework, or my mom had grounded me, or whatever. He got the hint quick, which is when he started to threaten me. It ended with a fistfight—Asher beating the shit out of me because I refused to “keep wrestling.” He was always stronger, bigger. I didn’t care about the beating. And my not caring freed me. When I made it clear that he’d have to give me regular black eyes—wounds that would get people asking a lot of questions—to keep it going, that’s when it stopped. Maybe that’s when I became a man. When my parents asked about the bruises, I told them Asher and I had another fight. They didn’t ask any follow-up questions. Maybe because they suspected I was gay. I think I tried to tell Linda once, but she refused to believe it and changed the subject. I don’t remember exactly what I said, but I was probably indirect, because how can you be direct about shit like that when you’re just going through puberty? Sometimes I remember her laughing, like I had told a joke. Sometimes I remember laughing too, just because it felt safer to laugh, although maybe I made that part up. The memory of that attempt to communicate is all fucking blurry, so I don’t really know. No one ever found out the truth and that seems wrong—dangerous even. I became a freak, while Asher somehow went on to become popular and well-adjusted and what most people would call normal, at least on the outside. The bullies are always popular. Why? People love power. Will I become temporarily powerful if I shoot Asher?64 I’ve been wondering. But—standing there outside his window—I become that scared little kid again whose parents are oblivious and gone; whose mother doesn’t even say a word when she walks in on her sixth-grade son and his best friend naked one day, but simply shuts the door and pretends it never happened.65 But for some reason—regardless of all that—I start thinking about this one summer day, before all of the weirdness started, back when we were just two kids. It’s the last good memory I have of my old friend. For no reason at all, Asher and I decided to ride our bikes as far as we could before we were due home for dinner. We left at nine AM and had to return by five PM. That gave us eight hours, so we decided to ride in one direction for three and a half hours, and then simply turn around and ride home for four and a half, figuring we’d be tired on the return trip, so it would take longer. It was a pointless thing to do—the type of plan kids come up with when they are bored to death in the summer. But we had never really left our town before without our parents, we knew we definitely weren’t allowed to do this, and so our hearts pounded as we began pedaling defiantly. It felt like we were embarking on an amazing, forbidden adventure. I remember Asher leading the way through all of these towns we’d never been to before even though they were close by and I remember experiencing a sense of freedom that was new and alive and intoxicating. I remember being forced to stop when a red and white gate came down, and, as we watched a train pass, I noticed Asher’s T-shirt was soaked in sweat. He had us pedaling hard and my thighs were on fire for most of the trip, but burned hottest then, when we were forced to wait idle. When the train passed and the gate went up, we were off again. He kept looking back over his shoulder and smiling at me—and I loved him in the sort of way you love a brother or a trusted friend—even as the bugs kept hitting my face and the summer wind blew back my hair. I remember sitting by a pond in a formerly unknown-to-us park located in a town where we knew no one—eating the slices of leftover pizza we had wrapped in tinfoil and stuffed into our backpacks.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forgive-me-leonard-peacock/page-19.html","bookId":2705,"book":{"id":2705,"title":"Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock","description":"Storyline: Not to his former best friend, whose torments have driven him to consider committing something tragic and horrific.
