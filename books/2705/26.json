{"id":73664,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Maybe I want Linda to find the wrapped-up hair and see it all—how horrible I was yesterday.\n What a shitty birthday I had.\n That she forgot she gave birth to me eighteen years ago.\n That she is the worst mother in the world.\n How much help I need.\n But Linda probably wouldn’t make the connection even if she found my hair wrapped in pink paper. She’d probably think I cut my hair as a present for her.\n I make my way upstairs to my bedroom.\n When I empty my pockets I realize that my cell phone ran out of power some point after I left Herr Silverman’s apartment, so I plug it in.\n After it loads up, the you-have-messages signal buzzes.\n There’s a voice mail from Linda, who says, “What did you tell your teacher about me? What’s going on? What is it this time? I’m in the back of a car on my way home instead of attending the several extremely important meetings I had planned. What the hell is going—”\n I delete before she can finish.\n Then there’s a message from Herr Silverman and his voice sounds different, sort of pissed. “Leonard? Why did you leave? Where did you go? I’m worried about you. I took a risk last night and I have to say I’m disappointed in you. You shouldn’t have left. You’ve put me in an awkward position, because I promised your mother that—”\n For some reason I delete him too.\n Then I feel guilty and call him back, even though he’s probably in school by now, because it’s later than I thought.\n The phone rings and rings and finally I get his voice mail.\n “It’s me. Leonard Peacock. Thanks for coming to the bridge last night. That was really cool… necessary, even. I’m sorry I got you in trouble with your partner. I’m sorry I’ve been such an asshole. I’m going to do the work. Don’t worry about me. I just had a bad night. I’ll be okay. But I’m taking a day off. I just had to leave this morning. Just got the urge to move. Had to greet the day, if you know what I mean. I hope your partner didn’t think I was rude. I won’t tell anyone that you’re gay. I don’t care that you’re gay. It doesn’t matter to me. That was probably a stupid thing to say, right? Because why should I care? I’d never say I don’t care that you’re black to a person of color. I’m an asshole. Sorry. Just forget about that part. See you Monday. Thanks again. And don’t worry about me! There’s nothing to worry about anymore. Nothing.” Then I just sort of hold the phone to my ear without hanging up. I listen to silence for a minute, thinking that all of what I said was just plain idiotic, and then there is a beep and this robot woman comes on and asks if I’m satisfied with my message. I don’t have the strength to answer that honestly, let alone record another, so I just hang up.\n It’s so quiet in my room that I wonder if this is what being dead sounds like.\n I hear Linda key into the front door and then she’s yelling, “Leo? Leo, are you here? Why didn’t you call me back?”\n I hate her.\n I hate her so much.\n She’s so stupid it’s almost comical.\n She’s such a caricature.\n Such a nonperson.\n What type of mother forgets her son’s eighteenth birthday?\n What type of mother ignores so many warning signs?\n It’s almost impossible to believe she exists.\n I hear her high heels click across the hardwood floor and then I hear silence as she stops by the hallway mirror to check her makeup. No matter what Herr Silverman told her, no matter how much he sugarcoated it, whatever he said was enough to get her to drive all the way here from New York City. So you’d think she’d run up the stairs to make sure I’m okay, right? Like any rational, caring mother would. Like any HUMAN would. But you’d be wrong.\n Linda can’t pass a mirror without pausing because she’s addicted to mirrors, so don’t judge her too harshly. She has issues. It doesn’t even piss me off, because that’s just Linda. I could be on fire, screaming my head off and she’d still have to pause in front of the mirror to check her makeup before she could extinguish me. That’s my mom.\n More clicking of high heels and then she’s walking up the steps, which has a runner of carpet so no clicking.\n “Leo?” she says joyfully, like she’s singing, and I wonder if she’s singing because she’s hoping I’m not here—like maybe she hopes I off-ed myself and she’ll never have to deal with me again. “Leo, where are you?”\n More clicking as she walks down the hallway, then silence as she crosses the oriental runner that leads to my bedroom.\n “Leo?” she says, and then knocks.\n I stare at the door so hard, thinking of how justified I’d be if I just went off on her, listing all the ways that she’s failed me, but I can’t bring myself to say anything.\n “Leo?” Linda says. “I hope you are decent. I’m coming in.”\n She pushes the door open and there she is in my bedroom doorframe. She’s wearing a white jacket with some sort of fur collar—it looks like mink. Her hair is perfect as always. She’s got on a knee-length bright green wool skirt—classy and age appropriate—and white heels. She looks amazing, as always. And it makes me laugh because her appearance suggests she’d have the perfect son—like she lives a perfect life and therefore has all the time in the world to make herself into a masterpiece of high fashion every day. People see Linda and they admire her. It’s true. You would too, if you saw her. And that’s her power.\n “I’m happy you finally cut your hair, but who cut it? They did a terrible job, Leo,” she says, and I want to strangle her. “What’s going on with you? What’s this all about? I’m here. I’m home. Now what seems to be the problem?”\n I shake my head, because even I’m amazed.\n What the hell am I supposed to say to that?\n “I spoke with your teacher, Mr. Silverman. He was a bit dramatic. He said you had your grandfather’s old war gun. As if that paperweight would ever fire, I told him. Well, you fooled him with your prank, because he was really concerned, Leo. Enough to insist I come home from New York immediately. You’ve caused quite a stir. I’m here. So let me have it—what’s so important? I’m listening.”\n I pretend that my eyes are P-38s and my sight is bullets and I blast holes through Linda’s outfit and watch the blood soak through.\n She’s so oblivious.\n So clueless.\n So awful.\n “Why are you staring at me like that, Leo?” She’s got her hands on her hips now. “Seriously, you look like the world’s about to end. What do you want from me? I came home. Your teacher says you want to talk. So let’s talk. Were you really pretending to shoot people with that rusty old Nazi gun your father used to carry around in his guitar case? What’s this about? What’s going on? You’re a pacifist, Leo. You wouldn’t hurt a fly. Take one look at the kid and you realize he’s incapable of violence. I told your teacher that, but he seemed really concerned. He says you need therapy. Therapy? I said. Like that ever did anyone any good. Your father and I tried therapy once and look how that ended up. I’ve never met a man or woman who escaped therapy better off than when they started.”\n I keep staring.\n “Your teacher said you might be suicidal, but I told him that was ridiculous. You’re not suicidal, are you, Leo? Just tell me if you are. We have money. We can get you medicine. Whatever you need. You can have whatever you want. Just ask for it. But I know you’re not suicidal. I know what the real problem is.”\n I fucking hate her.\n “I told him you do this when you miss your mother, so I came home, Leo. I always come home when you pull one of these pranks. And it wasn’t easy this time either. I had to cancel twelve meetings with important people. Twelve! Not that you would care about that. But someday you are going to have to learn how to live without your mother and—”\n “Do you remember when I was little—you used to make me banana pancakes with chocolate chips in them?” I say, because suddenly I have this idea.\n Linda just looks at me like my head has spun around 360 degrees.\n “You remember, right?” I say.\n “What are you talking about, Leo? Pancakes? I wasn’t driven two hours to talk about pancakes.”\n “You remember, Mom. We made them together once.”\n Linda’s lipstick smiles when she hears me say the word Mom because she hasn’t heard me say that word in many years.\n Ironically, she loves to be called Mom.\n “Banana–chocolate chip pancakes?” Linda says, and then laughs.\n I can tell by the look on her face that she doesn’t remember, but she’s faking like she does. Maybe she only made them once or twice—I dunno. Maybe I made up the memory in my mind. It’s possible. I don’t know why I’m thinking about this memory all of a sudden, but I am.\n I remember making banana–chocolate chip pancakes when I was little—like maybe when I was four or five years old—and getting mix everywhere and Dad was softly strumming his acoustic guitar at the kitchen table and my parents were happy that morning, which was rare, and probably why I remember it. Mom and I cooked and then we all ate together as a family.\n Normal for most people, but extraordinary for us.\n For some reason, I must have banana–chocolate chip pancakes in order for everything to be okay. Right now. It’s the only thing that will help. I don’t know why. That’s just the way it is. I tell myself that if Linda makes me banana–chocolate chip pancakes, I can forgive her for forgetting my birthday. I concoct that deal in my head and then attempt to make her fulfill her end of the unspoken bargain.\n “Can you make those for me now—banana–chocolate chip pancakes?” I ask. “That’s all I want from you. Make them, eat breakfast with me, and then you can go back to New York. Okay? Deal?”\n “Do we have the ingredients?” she says, looking completely perplexed.\n “Shit,” I say, because we don’t. I haven’t been shopping in weeks. “Shit, shit, shit.”\n “Do you have to say shit in front of your mother?”\n “If I get the ingredients, will you make me breakfast?”\n “That’s why you wanted me to come home? Banana–chocolate chip pancakes? That’s why you tricked your teacher into getting so worked up?”\n “You make them for me and I won’t give you any more problems all day. You can go back to New York with a clean conscience. Problem solved.”\n Linda laughs in a way that lets me know she’s relieved, and then she runs her perfectly manicured nails through my newly stubbled hair, which tickles.\n “You really are an odd boy, Leo.”\n “Is that a yes?”\n “I still don’t understand what happened yesterday. Why did your teacher call me and demand I come home? You seem fine to me.”\n Herr Silverman must not have told her it was my birthday, and I don’t even care about that anymore. I just want the fucking pancakes. It’s something Linda is capable of doing. It’s a task she can complete for me. It’s what I can have, so that’s what I want. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forgive-me-leonard-peacock/page-26.html","bookId":2705,"book":{"id":2705,"title":"Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock","description":"Storyline: \n Not to his former best friend, whose torments have driven him to consider committing something tragic and horrific. \n Nor to his mum who\u0027s moved out and left him to fend form himself.
