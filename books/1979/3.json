She locked her fingers around his hand, careful not to disturb the intravenous needle.\\n\\n “Valerie…so pleased you’re here…at last.”\\n\\n “Where else would I be?” she asked, managing a smile. With the back of her other hand, she brushed a tear from her cheek.\\n\\n “She’s beautiful, isn’t she?” her father said, apparently talking to Dr. Winston, who hovered in the doorway. “Only…what did you do to your hair?”\\n\\n “Do you like it?” Valerie asked, rallying somewhat, surprised he’d even noticed that she’d changed the style. “I had it cut.” The new look was short and tousled.\\n\\n “She’s got the temper to go with that red hair, you know.”\\n\\n Her father was speaking to Colby Winston again.\\n\\n “My hair isn’t even close to being red,” she argued, annoyed by the doctor’s effort not to grin. “It’s auburn.”\\n\\n “Looks like you haven’t combed it in a month,” her father mumbled.\\n\\n “Dad, I’ll have you know I paid good money for this.”\\n\\n “In that case, you should demand a refund.” His voice was weak, and speaking had clearly depleted him of what little energy he possessed.\\n\\n “Dad,” Valerie said, trying to disguise her concern. “Instead of complaining about my hair, you should rest.”\\n\\n He didn’t respond, merely closed his eyes and sighed audibly.\\n\\n “I’m going to leave you for a little while,” Valerie said. “But I’ll be right outside, so if you want to tell me how much you like my hair and beg my forgiveness, then all you need to do is ring for the nurse.” Dr. Winston had told her earlier that she’d be allowed to visit her father five minutes out of every hour, depending on how well he was doing.\\n\\n David’s smile was barely discernible.\\n\\n “Rest now, Daddy. I’m here.”\\n\\n Dr. Winston’s hand was at her elbow directing her out of the glass-enclosed cubicle.\\n\\n “Doc?” Her father’s voice had a sense of urgency.\\n\\n “What is it, David?”\\n\\n “She’s the one I was telling you about. You remember what I said, don’t you?”\\n\\n “Yes. Now don’t you worry about a thing.”\\n\\n “Her hair doesn’t usually look like a rag doll’s.”\\n\\n “Daddy!” Valerie had no idea what was taking place between the two men but she wasn’t going to stand idly by and let them insult her.\\n\\n “This way,” Colby Winston said, leading her from the Coronary Care Unit.\\n\\n “What was that all about?” Valerie asked the instant they were out of earshot.\\n\\n “I’m not sure I know what you mean,” he said without meeting her eyes.\\n\\n Valerie wasn’t fooled. There was definitely something going on, and she wanted to know what. She’d been in business far too long to allow questionable remarks to slip past her unchallenged.\\n\\n “What did Dad mean, I’m ‘the one’?”\\n\\n Dr. Winston still refused to look at her. “While we—your father and I—were talking earlier, he voiced a few concerns about his daughters.”\\n\\n “Yes?” Valerie said. Making an effort to appear nonchalant and relaxed, she walked over to the coffeepot and lifted it to him in silent invitation.\\n\\n Dr. Winston shook his head and Valerie refilled her own paper cup. “So, what did Dad have to say about us girls?” she asked.\\n\\n “He’s very proud of all three of you.”\\n\\n “Naturally. We’re his children. What I’d like to know is what he meant when he said I was ‘the one.’”\\n\\n “Yes, well…” He walked away from her and stood gazing out the window into the night sky.\\n\\n “Come on, Dr. Winston, I’m a mature woman and this is my father. I’m sure if I insisted he’d tell me.” They both knew that coercing her father was out of the question; nevertheless, it was an effective ploy. Dr. Winston went to the coffeepot and filled a cup, even though he’d declined one moments earlier.\\n\\n “It seems he’s the most worried about you.”\\n\\n “Me?” Valerie blurted. Of the three girls, she was the most financially secure. She was established in an excellent career and living on her own. For heaven’s sake, she was the only one with investments! “That makes no sense at all.”\\n\\n “Yes, well…”\\n\\n “Why is he worried about me? Furthermore, why didn’t he talk to me instead of discussing it with you?”\\n\\n “There are any number of reasons—”\\n\\n “Just tell me what he said,” Valerie interrupted impatiently.\\n\\n “Your father seems to think—”\\n\\n “Yes?” she prompted.\\n\\n “That you should be married.”\\n\\n Valerie couldn’t restrain her laughter. It shot out of her, like bubbles from a champagne bottle.\\n\\n “In fact,” Colby continued grimly, “your father seems to think you should be married to me.”\\n\\n Two\\n\\n “Married to you?” Valerie echoed, her laughter fading. Dr. Colby Winston! She’d never heard anything so preposterous. She had no intention of marrying anyone within the foreseeable future. There was simply no room for a man in her life. She wasn’t a romantic; even when she was younger and in college, she hadn’t dated much. Her father knew all that, and he’d never seemed particularly worried about it. This latest revelation shocked her nearly as much as Norah’s call.\\n\\n “I see no reason to be too concerned,” Colby said, his voice compassionate as though he understood that his announcement had unsettled her. She was usually more proficient at controlling her emotions.\\n\\n “This sort of delusion isn’t unheard of in heart patients,” he went on. “As I said, I certainly don’t think you have anything to worry about.”\\n\\n “You mean your patients generally try to marry you off?”\\n\\n “No.” He smoothed his tie as if he needed something to do. “Your father fully expects to die. It’s what he wants, but he’d feel better about leaving the three of you behind if at least one of you was married. Your father and I are friends, and I guess it’s only natural that he’d attempt to match me up with one of his daughters.”\\n\\n “It should’ve been Norah. She seems more your type.”\\n\\n His smile was fleeting. “Perhaps, but it’s your name he repeatedly mentions.”\\n\\n “Then apparently I’m the one,” Valerie said, not realizing what she was saying until the words had left her mouth. “I mean—” She stopped abruptly.\\n\\n “I know exactly what you mean,” Colby assured her. “But I’m sure we don’t have to take any of this seriously.”\\n\\n “Oh, I agree. That would be foolish in the extreme.”\\n\\n “Maybe your father feels you should marry first because you’re the oldest,” Colby ventured.\\n\\n “Maybe,” Valerie agreed. But something inside her suggested that wasn’t the sole reason. She tucked her arms around her waist and inhaled deeply, hoping to breathe in a bit of calm and sense.\\n\\n “I wouldn’t have said anything,” Colby said, “but I thought it was best to air this. If he mentions marriage again, my feeling is we should go along with him, at least for now.”\\n\\n “Go along with him? You’ve got to be kidding.” Valerie could hardly believe her ears.\\n\\n Colby shrugged. “You know your father better than I do,” he muttered. “He’s as stubborn as they come. Don’t lie, but if he brings up the subject of…marriage, take the route of least resistance, then try to channel the conversation in a different direction.”\\n\\n “I’m not going to give my father any false hope. Or you either.” She added the last part coyly and was rewarded when she saw him swallow tightly. An angry spark momentarily leaped into his dark eyes, but was soon quelled.\\n\\n Sitting down, Valerie rummaged through her purse for a roll of antacid tablets. Her stomach ached and she was weary to her very bones.\\n\\n Colby ignored her, although he made no move to go. The preoccupied look on his face suggested that he had something else to say; he seemed to be searching for words.\\n\\n Valerie considered what Colby had told her. If she ever decided to marry—if—she’d settle down with someone who had the same drive, the same will to succeed, as she did. A man who knew where he was going, who’d set his sights high. Not some well-meaning small-town doctor.\\n\\n She’d marry a man like Rowdy Cassidy.\\n\\n The name sprang into her mind with a suddenness that shocked her.\\n\\n Until that moment, Valerie didn’t fully grasp how much she admired her employer. Rowdy had started his computer software business out of a friend’s garage fifteen years earlier. He’d built the company into one of the most successful in the country. Although he’d earned more money than he could possibly spend in a lifetime, he continued to work ten-and twelve-hour days, demanding as much of his staff as he did of himself.\\n\\n “It might, uh, help matters if you were involved with someone,” Colby said in a casual voice. Valerie found his nonchalant tone a bit exaggerated, which for some reason made her suspect that he wasn’t “involved with someone.”\\n\\n “I’m not in a relationship at the moment, but I might be soon,” she told him. Valerie and Rowdy—a couple. Odd that she’d never thought of him in romantic terms before. He’d be the perfect husband for her. She liked him and respected him, as a man and a professional. Rowdy had hand-picked her for his management team because he believed in her abilities.\\n\\n In retrospect, she realized Rowdy had sought out her company on several occasions. But she’d been so absorbed in proving herself worthy of his faith that she hadn’t guessed he might have any personal feelings for her.\\n\\n For months she’d been blind to what was right in front of her. Not that she was entirely to blame, though. Rowdy wasn’t exactly a heartthrob kind of guy. Oh, he was handsome enough, with his rugged cowboy looks, but his brusque, outspoken manner didn’t encourage romantic aspirations. As far as she knew, he’d never dated anyone seriously, at least not in the years she’d worked for him.\\n\\n For that matter, Valerie wasn’t any expert on falling in love, either. She’d dismissed the possibility of romance in her own life; it was fine for her sisters and school-friends, but not for her. There’d always been too much she wanted to do, too much to strive for. Too much to achieve before settling down in a permanent relationship.\\n\\n “I’m afraid I don’t understand,” Colby said, breaking into her thoughts. At her blank look, he elaborated. “You said you weren’t involved with someone yet, but you will be soon. I may be overstepping my bounds here, but I wouldn’t advise you to invent a phony relationship. Your father would see through that in a minute.”\\n\\n “I agree. I wouldn’t even attempt anything so foolish. But there’s a man I work with, and, well, it seems natural for the two of us to…get involved.”\\n\\n Dr. Winston looked so relieved that she might’ve been offended if she hadn’t been warmed by the newly risen hope of a romance with Rowdy Cassidy. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/orchard-valley-grooms-orchard-valley-0/page-3.html","bookId":1979,"book":{"id":1979,"title":"Orchard Valley Grooms (Orchard Valley #0)","description":"Storyline: Orchard Valley Grooms: Valerie\\Stephanie (Orchard Valley #1-2) \\n Valerie rushes home to Orchard Valley, Oregon, when her father, David, suffers a heart attack.
