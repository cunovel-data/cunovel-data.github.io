{"id":25880,"no":7,"title":"DICK O\u0027 THE COW","content":"\"Now Liddesdale has layen lang in, There is na ryding there at a\u0027; The horses are a\u0027 grown sae lither fat, They downa stir out o\u0027 the sta\u0027. Fair Johnie Armstrong to Willie did say— \u0027Billy, a riding we will gae; England and us have lang been at feid; Ablins we\u0027ll light on some bootie.\u0027\" It was somewhere about the year 1592, and Thomas, Lord Scroope, sat at ease in his own apartment in Carlisle Castle. He had finished supper, and was now resting in a great oak chair before a roaring fire. A tankard of ale stood on a stool by his side (for my Lord of Scroope loved good cheer above all things), and his favourite hound lay stretched on the floor at his feet. To judge by the look on his face, he was thinking pleasant thoughts just then. He held the office of Warden of the English Marches, as well as that of Governor of Carlisle Castle, and in those lawless days the post was not an easy one. There was generally some raid or foray which had to be investigated, some turbulent Scot pursued, or mayhap some noted freebooter hung; but just at present the country-side was at peace, and the Scotts, and Elliots, and Armstrongs, seemed to be content to stay quietly at home on their own side of the Border. So that very day he had sent off a good report to his royal mistress, Queen Elizabeth, then holding her court in far-off London, and now he was dreaming of paying a long deferred visit to his Castle of Bolton in Lancashire. A sharp knock at the door came as a sudden interruption to these dreams. \"Enter,\" he cried hastily, wondering to himself what message could have arrived at the castle at that hour of night. It was his own poor fool who entered, for in Carlisle Castle high state was kept, and Lord Scroope had his jester, like any king. The man was known to everyone as \"Dick o\u0027 the Cow,\" the reason probably being that his wife helped to eke out his scanty wages by keeping three cows, and selling their milk to the honest burghers of Carlisle. He was a harmless, light-hearted fellow, whom some men called half-witted, but who was much cleverer than he appeared at first sight to be. As a rule he was always laughing and making jokes, but to-night his face was long and doleful. \"What ails thee, man?\" cried Lord Scroope impatiently. \"Methinks thou hast forgot thine office, else why comest thou here with a face that would make a merry man sad?\" \"Alack, Master,\" answered the fool, \"up till now I have been an honest man, but at last I must turn my hand to thieving, and for that reason I would crave thy leave to go over the Border into Liddesdale.\" \"Tush!\" said the Warden impatiently, \"I love not such jesting. I hear enough about thieving and reiving, and such-like business, without my very fool dinning it into my ears. Leave such matters for my Lord of Buccleuch and me to settle, Sirrah, and bethink thee of thy duty. \u0027Tis easier to crack jokes and sing songs in the safe shelter of Carlisle Castle than to ride out armed against these Scottish knaves.\" But Dick knelt at his master\u0027s feet. \"This is no jest, my lord,\" he said. \"For once in his life this poor fool is in earnest. For I am like to be ruined if I cannot have revenge. Thou knowest how my wife and I live in a little cottage just outside the city walls, and how, with my small earnings, I bought three milch cows. My wife is a steady woman and industrious, and she sells the milk which these three cows give, to the people in the city, and so she earns an honest penny.\" \"In good sooth, a very honest penny,\" repeated Lord Scroope, laughing, for \u0027twas well known in Carlisle that the milk which was sold by Dick o\u0027 the Cow\u0027s wife was thinner and dearer than any other milk sold in the town. \"Last night,\" went on the fool, \"these Scottish thieves, the Armstrongs of Liddesdale, rode past the house, and, of course, they must needs drive these cows off, and, not content with that, they broke open the door, and stole the very coverlets off my bed. My wife bought these coverlets at the Michaelmas fair, and, I trow, what with the loss of them, and the loss of the cows, she is like to lose her reason. So, to comfort her, I have promised to bring them back. Therefore, my lord, I crave leave of thee to go over into Liddesdale, and see what I can lay my hands on there.\" The blood rose to the Warden\u0027s face. \"By my troth, but thou art not frightened to speak, Sirrah,\" he cried. \"Am I not set here to preserve law and order, and thou wouldst have me give thee permission to steal?\" \"Nay, not to steal,\" said the fool slyly; \"I only crave leave to get back my own, or, at least, the money\u0027s worth for what was my own.\" Lord Scroope pondered the request for a minute or two. \"After all,\" he thought to himself, \"what can this one poor man do against such a powerful clan as the Armstrongs? He will be killed, most likely, and that will be the end of it. So there can be no great harm in letting him go.\" \"If I give thee leave, wilt thou swear that thou wilt steal from no one but those who stole from thee?\" he asked at last. \"That I will,\" said Dick readily. \"I give thee my troth, and there is my right hand upon it. Thou canst hang me for a thief myself, if I take as much as a bannock of bread from the house of any man who hath done me no harm.\" So my Lord of Scroope let him go. A blithe man was Dick o\u0027 the Cow as he went down the streets of Carlisle next morning, for he had money in his pocket, and a big scheme floating in his brain. It mattered little to him that men smiled to each other as they passed him, and whispered, \"There goes my Lord of Scroope\u0027s poor jester.\" \"He laughs the longest who laughs the last,\" he thought to himself, \"and mayhap all men will envy me before long.\" First of all, he went and bought a pair of spurs, and a new bridle, which he carefully hid in his breeches pocket, then he turned his back on Carlisle and set out to walk over Bewcastle Waste into Liddesdale. It was a long walk, but he footed it bravely, and at last he arrived at Pudding-burn House, a strongly fortified place, held by John Armstrong, \"The Laird\u0027s Jock,\" as he was called, son of the Laird of Mangerton, and a man of importance in the clan. He was known to be both just and generous, and the poor fool thought that he would go to him, and tell him his story, in the hope that he would force the rest of the Armstrongs to give him back his three cows. But when he came near the Pudding-burn House, he found to his dismay that the two Armstrongs who had stolen his cows, Johnie and Willie, had stopped there, on their way home, with all their men-at-arms, and, from the sounds of feasting and mirth which he heard as he approached, he suspected that one, at least, of his three cows had been killed to provide the supper. \"Ah well,\" thought he to himself, \"I am but a poor fool, and there are three-and-thirty armed men against me. To fight is impossible, so I must e\u0027en set my wits to work against their strength of arms.\" So he walked boldly up to the house, and demanded to see the Laird\u0027s Jock. There was much laughter among the men-at-arms as he was led into the great hall, for everyone had heard of my Lord of Scroope\u0027s jester, and, when they knew that it was he, they all crowded round to see what he was like. He knew his manners, and bowed right low before the master of the house. \"God save thee, my good Laird\u0027s Jock,\" he said, \"although I fear me I cannot wish so well to all thy company. For I come here to bring a complaint against two of these men—against Johnie and Willie Armstrong, who, with their followers, broke into my house near Carlisle these two nights past, and drove away my three good milk cows, forbye stealing three coverlets from my bed. And I crave that I get my own again, and that justice may be meted out to the dishonest varlets.\" These words were greeted by a shout of laughter, for these were rough and lawless times, when might was right, and the strong tyrannised over the weak, and it seemed ridiculous to see this poor fool standing in the middle of all these armed moss-troopers, and expecting to be heard. \"He deserves to be hanged for his insolence,\" said Johnie Armstrong, who had been the leader of the company. \"Run him through with a sword,\" said Willie, laughing; \"\u0027tis less trouble, and \u0027twill serve the same end.\" \"No,\" cried another. \"\u0027Tis not worth while to kill him. He is but a fool at the best. Let us give him a good beating, and then let him go.\" But the Laird\u0027s Jock heard them, and his voice rang out high above the rest. \"Why harm the poor man?\" he said. \"After all, he hath but come to seek his own, and he must be both hungry and footsore.\" Then, turning to the fool, he added kindly, \"Sit thyself down, my man, and rest thee a little. I am sorry that we cannot exactly give thee thy cattle back again, but at least we can give thee a slice from the leg of one of them. Beshrew me if I have tasted finer beef for many a long day.\" Amid roars of laughter a slice of beef was cut from the enormous leg which lay roasted on the great table, and placed before Dick. But he could not eat it, he could only think what a fine cow it had been when it was alive. At last he slipped away unobserved out of the house, and, looking about for somewhere to sleep, he found an old tumble-down house filled with peats. He crept into it, and lay there, wondering and scheming how he could avenge himself. Now it had always been the custom at Mangerton Hall, where the Laird\u0027s Jock had been brought up, that whoever was not in time for one meal had to wait till the next, and he made the same rule hold good at Pudding-burn House. As the poor fool lay among the peats, he could see what was going on through a crack in the door, and he noticed that, as the Armstrongs\u0027 men were both tired and hungry, they did not take time to put the key away safely after attending to their horses and locking the stable door, but flung it hastily up on the roof, where it could easily be found if it were wanted, and hurried off in case they were late for their supper. \"Here is my chance,\" he thought to himself, and, as soon as they were all gone into the house, he crept out, and took down the key, and entered the stable. Then he did a very cruel thing. He cut every horse, except three, on one of its hind legs, \"tied it with St Mary\u0027s knot,\" as it was called; so that he made them all lame. Then he hastily drew the spurs and the new bridle out of his breeches pocket. He buckled on the spurs, and began to examine the three horses which he had not lamed. He knew to whom they belonged. Two of them, which were standing together, belonged to Johnie and Willie Armstrong, and were the very horses they had ridden when they stole the cows. The third, a splendid animal, which had a stall to itself, plainly belonged to the Laird\u0027s Jock. \"I will leave the Laird\u0027s Jock\u0027s,\" thought Dick to himself, \"for I cannot take three, and he is a kind man; but Johnie\u0027s and Willie\u0027s must go. \u0027Twill perhaps teach them what comes of dishonest ways.\" So saying, he slipped the bridle over the head of one horse, and tied a rope round the neck of the other, and, opening the stable door, he led them out quietly, and then, mounting one of them, he galloped away as fast as he could. The next morning, when the men went to the stable to see after their horses, there were shouts of anger and consternation. And no wonder. For it was easy to be seen that thirty of the horses would never put foot to the ground again; other two were stolen; and there was only one, the beautiful bay mare which belonged to the Laird\u0027s Jock, which was of any use at all. \"Now who hath done this cruel thing?\" cried the master of the house in great anger. \"Let me know his name, and by my soul, he shall be punished.\" \"\u0027Twas the varlet whom we all took to be such a fool,\" cried Johnie; \"the rascal who came here last night whining for his precious cows. A thousand pities but we had done as I said, and hanged him on the nearest tree.\" \"Hold thy tongue and take blame to thyself,\" said the Laird\u0027s Jock sharply. \"Did I not tell thee, ere thou rode to Carlisle, thou and Willie and thy thieving band, that the two countries were at peace, and if thou began this work once more, \u0027twas hard to say where it would end? Truly the tables are indeed turned. For this poor fool, as thou callest him, hath befooled us all, for the men\u0027s horses are maimed and useless, thine own and thy brother\u0027s are stolen, and there but remains this good bay mare of mine. Beshrew me, but it seems as if the fellow had some gratitude left that he did not touch her, for I love her as I never loved a horse before.\" \"Give her to me,\" cried Johnie Armstrong quickly, stung by this well-earned reproof, \"and I will bring the two horses back, and the cunning fool with them, either alive or dead. \u0027Tis a far cry from here to Carlisle, and I trow he could ride but slowly in the darkness.\" \"A likely story,\" said the Laird\u0027s Jock. \"The fool, as thou callest him, hath already stolen two good horses, and to send another after him would but be sending good siller after bad.\" \"An\u0027 dost thou think that he could take the horse from me?\" asked Johnie indignantly, and he pleaded so hard to be allowed to pursue Dick, that at last the Laird\u0027s Jock gave him leave. He wasted no time in seeking his armour, but, snatching up hastily his kinsman\u0027s doublet, sword, and helmet, he leaped on the bay mare and galloped away. He rode so furiously that by midday he overtook Dick on Canonbie Lee, not far from Longtown. The poor fool had had to ride slowly, for he was not very much accustomed to horses, and it was not easy for him to manage two. He looked round in alarm when he heard the thunder of hoofs behind him, but his face cleared when he saw that Johnie Armstrong was alone. \"I have outwitted a whole household,\" he thought to himself; \"beshrew me if I cannot tackle one man, even although it be Johnie Armstrong.\" All the same he put his horses to the gallop, and went on as fast as he could. \"Now hold, thou traitor thief, and stand for thy life,\" shouted Johnie in a passion. Dick glanced hastily over his shoulder, and then he pulled his horses round suddenly. He could fight better than most men thought, when he was put to it. \"Art thou alone, Johnie?\" he said tauntingly. \"Then must I tell thee a little story. I am an unlettered man, being but a poor fool, as thou knowest, but I try to do my duty, and every Sunday I go to church in Carlisle city with my betters. And at our church we have a right good preacher, though his sermons run through my poor brain as if it were a sieve; but there are three words which I aye remember. The first two of these are \u0027faith\u0027 and \u0027conscience,\u0027 and it seems to me that ye lacked both of them when ye came stealing in the dark to my humble cottage, knowing full well that I could not defend myself, and stole my cows, and took my wife\u0027s coverlets. What the third word is, I cannot at this moment remember, but it means that when a man lacks faith and conscience he deserves to be punished, and therefore have I punished thee.\" Johnie Armstrong felt that he was being laughed at, and, blind with fury, he took his lance and flung it at the fool, thinking to kill him. But he missed his aim, and it only glanced against Dick\u0027s doublet, and fell harmless to the ground. Dick saw his advantage, and rode his horse straight at his enemy, and, taking his cudgel by the wrong end, he struck Johnie such a blow on the head that he fell senseless to the ground. Then was the fool a proud man. \"Lord Scroope shall hear of this, Johnie,\" he said to himself, with a chuckle of delight, as he dismounted, and stripped the unconscious man of his coat-of-mail, his steel helmet, and his two-handed sword. He knew that if he went home empty-handed, and told his master that he had fought with Johnie Armstrong and defeated him, Lord Scroope would laugh him to scorn, for Johnie was known to be one of the best fighters on the Borders; but these would serve as proofs that his story was true. Then, taking the bay mare by the bridle, he mounted his horse once more, and rode on to Carlisle in triumph. When Johnie Armstrong came to his senses, he cursed the English and all belonging to them with right goodwill. \"Now verily,\" he said to himself, as he turned his face ruefully towards Liddesdale, \"\u0027twill be a hundred years and more ere anyone finds me fighting with a man who is called a fool again.\" When Dick o\u0027 the Cow rode into the courtyard of Carlisle Castle with his three horses, the first man he met was My Lord of Scroope. Now the Warden knew the Laird\u0027s Jock\u0027s bay mare at once, and at the sight of her he flew into a violent passion. For he knew well enough that if Dick had stolen three horses from the Armstrongs, that powerful clan would soon ride over into Cumberland to avenge themselves, and had he not written to Queen Elizabeth, not three days before, of the peace which prevailed on the Borders? \"By my troth, fellow,\" he said in deep vexation, \"I\u0027ll have thee hanged for this.\" Poor Dick was much taken aback at this unlooked-for welcome. He had expected to be greeted as a hero, instead of being threatened with death. \"\u0027Twas thyself gave me leave to go, my Lord,\" he said sullenly. \"Ay, I gave thee leave to go and steal from those who stole from thee, an thou couldst,\" said Lord Scroope in reply; \"but beshrew me if I ever gave thee leave to steal from the good Laird\u0027s Jock. He is a peaceful man, and a true, and meddles not the Border folk. \u0027Twas not he who stole thy cows.\" Then Dick held up the coat-of-mail, and the helmet, and the two-handed sword. \"On my honour, I won them all in fair and open fight,\" he cried. \"Johnie Armstrong stole my cows, and \u0027twas he who followed me on the Laird\u0027s Jock\u0027s mare, and clad in the Laird\u0027s Jock\u0027s armour. He would fain have slain me with his lance, but by God\u0027s grace it glanced from my doublet, and I felled him to the ground with my cudgel.\" \"Well done!\" cried the Warden, slapping his thigh in his delight. \"By my soul, but it was well done. My poor fool is more of a man than I thought he was. If the horse be the fair spoil of war, then will I buy her of thee. See, I will give thee fifteen pounds for her, and throw a milk cow into the bargain. \u0027Twill please thy wife to have milk again.\" But Dick was not satisfied with this offer. \"May the mother of all the witches fly away with me,\" he said, \"if the horse is not worth more than fifteen pounds. No, no, my Lord, twenty pounds is her price, an if thou wilt not pay that for her, she goes with me to-morrow to be sold at Morton Fair.\" Now Lord Scroope happened to know the worth of the mare, so he paid the money down without more ado, and he kept his word about the milk cow. As Dick pocketed the money, and took possession of the cow, he thought what a very clever fellow he was, and he held his head high as he rode out of the courtyard, and down the streets of Carlisle, still leading one horse, and driving the cow in front of him. He had not gone very far before he met Lord Scroope\u0027s brother. \"Well met, fool,\" he cried, laying his hand on Dick\u0027s bridle rein. \"Where in all the world didst get Johnie Armstrong\u0027s horse? I know \u0027tis his by the white feet and white forelock. Has my brother been having a fray with Scotland?\" \"No,\" said the fool proudly, \"but I have. The horse is mine by right of arms.\" \"Wilt sell him me?\" asked the Warden\u0027s brother, who loved a good horse if only he could get him cheaply. \"I will give thee ten pounds for him, and a milk cow into the bargain.\" \"Say twenty pounds,\" said Dick contemptuously, \"and keep thy word about the milk cow, else the horse goes with me to Morton Fair.\" Now the Warden\u0027s brother needed the horse, and, besides, it was not dear even at twenty pounds, so he paid down the money, and told the fool where to go for the milk cow. An hour later Dick appeared at his own cottage door, and shouted for his wife. She rubbed her eyes and blinked with astonishment when she saw her husband mounted on a good black horse, and driving two fat milk cows before him. Like everyone else, she had always counted him a fool, and had never looked for much help from him. So the loss of the three cows had been a serious matter to her, for the money which their milk brought had done much towards keeping up the house, and clothing the children. \"Here, woman,\" he cried joyously, leaping from his horse, and emptying the gold out of his pockets into her apron. \"Thou madest a great to-do over thy coverlets, but I trow that forty pounds of good red money will pay for them fully, and the three cows which we lost were but thin, starved creatures, compared with these two that I have brought back, and here is a good horse into the bargain.\" It all seemed too good to be true, and Dick\u0027s wife rubbed her eyes once more. \"Take care that they be not taken from thee,\" she said. \"Methinks the Armstrongs will demand vengeance.\" \"They will not get it from My Lord of Scroope,\" answered Dick, \"for \u0027twas he who gave me leave to go and steal from them. But mayhap we live too near the Borders for our own comfort, now that we are so rich. When a man hath made his fortune by his wits, as I have, he deserves a little peace in his old age. What wouldst thou think of going further South into Westmoreland, and taking up house near thy mother\u0027s kinsfolk?\" \"I would think \u0027twas the wisest plan that ever entered that silly pate of thine,\" answered his wife, who had never liked to live in such an unsettled region. So they packed up their belongings, and, getting leave from Lord Scroope, they went to live at Burghunder-Stanmuir, where they passed for quite rich and clever people.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2359/65856.html","bookId":588,"book":{"id":588,"title":"Tales From Scottish Ballads","description":"简介： Once upon a time, there was an old man in Lochmaben, who made his livelihood by going round the country playing on his harp.
