How they ha\u0027e ta\u0027en bauld Kinmont Willie, On Haribee to hang him up?\" \n \n I well remember the dull April morning, in the year 1596, when my father, William Armstrong of Kinmont, \"Kinmont Willie,\" as he was called by all the countryside, set out with me for a ride into Cumberland. \n \n As a rule, when he set his face that way, he rode armed, and with all his men behind him, for these were the old reiving days, when we folk who dwelt on the Scottish side of the Border thought we had a right to go and steal what we could, sheep, or oxen, or even hay, from the English loons, who, in their turn, would come slipping over from their side to take like liberties with us, and mayhap burn down a house or two in the by-going. \n \n My father was aye in the thick and throng of these raids, for he was such a big powerful man that he was more than a match for three Englishmen, did he chance to meet them. Men called him an outlaw, but we thought little of that; most of the brave men on our side had been outlawed at one time or another, and it did them little ill: indeed, it was aye thought to be rather a feather in their cap. \n \n Well, as I say, my father was not riding on business, as it were, this morning, for just then there was a truce for a day or two between the countries, the two Wardens of the Marches, Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch, and My Lord Scroope, having sent their deputies to meet and settle some affairs at the Dayholme of Kershope, where a burn divides England from Scotland. My father and I had attended the Truce Muster, and were riding homeward with but a handful of men, when I took a sudden notion into my head, that I would like to cross the Border, and ride a few miles on English ground. \n \n My birthday had fallen the week before (I was just eleven years old), and my father, aye kind to his motherless bairns, had given me a new pony, a little shaggy beast from Galloway, and, as I was keen to see how it would run beside a big man\u0027s horse, I had pled hard for permission to accompany him on it to the Muster. \n \n As a rule I never rode with him. \"I was too young for the work,\" he would say; but that day he gave his consent, only making the bargain that there should be no crying out or grumbling if I were tired or hungry long ere we got home again. I had laughed at the idea as I saddled my shaggy little nag, and, to make matters sure, I had gone to Janet, the kitchen wench, and begged her for a satchel of oatcakes and cheese, which I fastened to my saddle strap, little dreaming what need I would have of them before the day was out. \n \n The Truce Muster had broken up sooner than he expected, so my father saw no reason why he should not grant my request, and let me have a canter on English soil, for on a day of truce we could cross the Border if we chose without the risk of being taken prisoners by Lord Scroope\u0027s men, and marched off to Carlisle Castle, while the English had a like privilege, and could ride down Liddesdale in open daylight, if they were so minded. \n \n Scarce had we crossed the little burn, however, which runs between low-growing hazel bushes, and separates us from England, when two of the men rode right into a bog, and when, after some half-hour\u0027s work, we got the horses out again, we found that both of them wanted a shoe, and my father said at once that we must go straight home, in case they went lame. \n \n At this I drew a long face. I had never been into England, and it was a sore disappointment to be turned back just when we had reached it. \n \n \"Well, well,\" said my father, laughing, ever soft-hearted where I was concerned, \"I suppose I must e\u0027en take thee a ride into Bewcastle, lad, since we have got this length. The men can go back with the horses; \u0027tis safe enough to go alone to-day.\" \n \n So the men turned back, nothing loth, for Bewcastle Waste was no unknown land to them, and my father and I rode on for eight miles or so, over that most desolate country. Its bareness and loneliness disappointed me. Somehow I had expected that England would be quite different from Scotland, even although they were all one piece of land, with only a burn running between. \n \n \"Hast had enough?\" said my father at last, noticing my downcast face, and drawing rein. \"Didst expect all the trees to be made of silver, and all the houses to be built of gold? Never mind, lad, every place looks much the same in the month of April, I trow, especially when it has been a backward season; but if summer were once and here, I\u0027ll let thee ride with the troop, and mayhap thou wilt get a glimpse of \u0027Merrie Carlisle,\u0027 as they call it. It lies over there, twelve miles or more from where we stand.\" \n \n As he pointed out the direction with his whip, we both became aware of a large body of men, riding rapidly over the moor as if to meet us. My father eyed them keenly, his face growing grave as he did so. \n \n \"Who are they, father?\" I asked with a sinking heart. I had lived long enough at Kinmont to know that men did not generally ride together in such numbers unless they were bent on mischief. \n \n \"It\u0027s Sakelde, the English Warden\u0027s deputy, and no friend o\u0027 mine,\" he answered with a frown, \"and on any other day I would not have met him alone like this for a hundred merks; but the truce holds for three days yet, so we are quite safe; all the same, lad, we had better turn our horses round, and slip in behind that little hill; they may not have noticed us, and in that case \u0027tis no use rousing their curiosity.\" \n \n Alas! we had no sooner set our horses to the trot, than it became apparent that not only were we observed, but that for some reason or other the leader of the band of horsemen was desirous of barring our way. \n \n He gave an order,—we could see him pointing with his hand,—and at once his men spurred on their horses and began to spread out so as to surround us. Then my father swore a big oath, and plunged his spurs into his horse\u0027s sides. \"Come on, Jock,\" he shouted, \"sit tight and be a man; if we can only get over the hill edge at Kershope, they\u0027ll pay for this yet.\" \n \"MY FATHER EYED THEM KEENLY, HIS FACE GROWING GRAVE AS HE DID SO.\" \n \n I will remember that race to my dying day. It appeared to last for hours, but it could not have lasted many minutes, ten at the most, during which time all the blood in my body seemed to be pounding and surging in my head, and the green grass and the sky to be flying past me, all mixed up together, and behind, and on all sides, came the pit-pat of horses\u0027 feet, and then someone seized my pony\u0027s rein, and brought him up with a jerk, and my father and I were sitting in the midst of two hundred armed riders, whose leader, a tall man, with a thin cunning face, regarded us with a triumphant smile. \n \n \"Neatly caught, thou thieving rogue,\" he said; \"by my troth, neatly caught. Who would have thought that Kinmont Willie would have been such a fool as to venture so far from home without an escort? But I can supply the want, and thou shalt ride to Carlisle right well attended, and shall never now lack a guard till thou partest with thy life at Haribee.\" \n \n As the last word fell on my ear, I had much ado to keep my seat, for I turned sick and faint, and all the crowd of men and horses seemed to whirl round and round. Haribee! Right well I knew that fateful name, for it was the place at Carlisle where they hanged prisoners. They could not hang my father—they dare not—for although he had been declared an outlaw, and might perhaps merit little love from the English, was not this a day of truce, when all men could ride where they would in safety? \n \n \"\u0027Tis a day of truce,\" I gasped with dry lips; but the men around me only laughed, and I could hear that my father\u0027s fierce remonstrance met with no better answer. \n \n \"Thou art well named, thou false Sakelde,\" I heard him say, and his voice shook with fury, \"for no man of honour would break the King\u0027s truce in this way.\" \n \n But Sakelde only gave orders to his men to bind their prisoner, saying, as he did so, \"I warrant Lord Scroope will be too glad to see thee to think much about the truce, and if thou art so scrupulous, thou needest not be hanged for a couple of days; the walls of Carlisle Castle are thick enough to guard thee till then. Be quick, my lads,\" he went on, turning to his men; \"we have a good fourteen miles to ride yet, and I have no mind to be benighted ere we reach firmer ground.\" \n \n So they tied my father\u0027s feet together under his horse, and his hands behind his back, and fastened his bridle rein to that of a trooper, and the word was given for the men to form up, and they began to move forward as sharply as the boggy nature of the ground would allow. \n \n I followed in the rear with a heavy heart. I could easily have escaped had I wanted to do so, for no one paid any attention to me; but I felt that, as long as I could, I must stay near my father, whose massive head and proud set face I could see towering above the surrounding soldiers, for he was many inches taller than any of them. \n \n The spring evening was fast drawing to a close as we came to the banks of the Liddle, and splashed down a stony track to a place where there was a ford. As we paused for a moment or two to give the horses a drink, my father\u0027s voice rang out above the careless jesting of the troopers. \n \n \"Let me say good-bye to my eldest son, Sakelde, and send him home; or do the English war with bairns?\" \n \n I saw the blood rise to the English leader\u0027s thin sallow face at the taunt, but he answered quietly enough, \"Let the boy speak to him and then go back,\" and a way was opened up for me to where my father sat, a bound and helpless prisoner, on his huge white horse. \n \n One trooper, kinder than the rest, took my pony\u0027s rein as I slid off its back and ran to him. Many a time when I was little, had I had a ride on White Charlie, and I needed no help to scramble up to my old place on the big horse\u0027s neck. \n \n My father could not move, but he looked down at me with all the anger and defiance gone out of his face, and a look on it which I had only seen there once before, and that was when he lifted me up on his knee after my mother died and told me that I must do my best to help him, and try to look after the little ones. \n \n That look upset me altogether, and, forgetting the many eyes that watched us, and the fact that I was eleven years old, and almost a man, I threw my arms round his neck and kissed him again and again, sobbing and greeting as any bairn might have done, all the time. \n \n \"Ride home, laddie, and God be with ye. Remember if I fall that thou art the head of the house, and see that thou do honour to the name,\" he said aloud. Then he signed to me to go, and, just as I was clambering down, resting a toe in his stirrup, he made a tremendous effort and bent down over me. \"If thou could\u0027st but get word to the Lord of Buccleuch, laddie, \u0027tis my only chance. They dare not touch me for two days yet. Tell him I was ta\u0027en by treachery at the time o\u0027 truce.\" \n \n The whisper was so low I could hardly hear it, and yet in a moment I understood all it was meant to convey, and my heart beat until I thought that the whole of Sakelde\u0027s troopers must read my secret in my face as I passed through them to where my pony stood. \n \n With a word of thanks I took the rein from the kindly man who had held it, and then stood watching the body of riders as they splashed through the ford, and disappeared in the twilight, leaving me alone. \n \n But I felt there was work for me to do, and a ray of hope stole into my heart. True, it was more than twenty miles, as the crow flies, to Branksome Tower in Teviotdale, where my Lord of Buccleuch lived, and I did not know the road, which lay over some of the wildest hills of the Border country, but I knew that he was a great man, holding King James\u0027 commission as Warden of the Scottish Marches, and at his bidding the whole countryside would rise to a man. \u0027Twas well known that he bore no love to the English, and when he knew that my father had been taken in time of truce...! The fierce anger rose in my heart at the thought, and, burying my face in my pony\u0027s rough coat, I vowed a vow, boy as I was, to be at Branksome by the morning, or die in the attempt. I knew that it was no use going home to Kinmont for a man to ride with me, for it was out of my way, and would only be a waste of time. \n \n It was almost dark now, but I knew that the moon would rise in three or four hours, and then there would be light enough for me to try to thread my way over the hills that lay between the valleys of the Teviot and Liddle. In the meantime, there was no special need to hurry, so I loosened my pony\u0027s rein, and let him nibble away at the short sweet grass which was just beginning to spring, while I unbuckled the bag of cakes which I had put up so gaily in the morning, and, taking one out, along with a bit of cheese, did my best to make a hearty meal. But I was not very successful, for when the heart is heavy, food goes down but slowly, and Janet\u0027s oatcake and the good ewe cheese, which at other times I found so toothsome, seemed fairly to stick in my throat, so at last I gave it up, and, taking the pony by the head, I began to lead him up the valley. \n \n Although I had been down the Liddle as far as the ford once or twice before, it had always been in daylight, and my father had been with me; but I knew that as long as I kept close to the river I was all right for the first few miles, until the valley narrowed in, and then I must strike off among the high hills on my left. \n \n It was slow work, for it was too dark to ride, and I dare not leave the water in case I lost my way, and by the time we had gone mayhap four or five miles, I had almost lost heart, for I was both tired and cold, and it seemed to me that half the night at least must be gone, and at this rate we would never reach Branksome at all. \n \n At last, just when the tears were getting very near my eyes—for I was but a little chap to be set on such a desperate errand—I struck on a narrow road which led up a brae to my left, and going along it for a hundred yards or so, I saw a light which seemed to come from a cottage window. I stopped and looked at it, wondering if I dare go boldly up and knock. \n \n In those lawless days one had to be cautious about going up to strange houses, for one never knew whether one would find a friend or an enemy within, so I determined to tie my pony to a tree, and steal noiselessly up to the building, and see what sort of place it was. \n \n I did so, and found that the light came from a tiny thatched cottage standing by itself, sheltered by some fir trees. There appeared to be no dogs about, so I crept quite close to the little window, and peered in through a hole in the shutter. I could see the inside of the room quite plainly; it was poorly furnished, but beautifully clean. In a corner opposite the window stood a rough settle, while on a three-legged stool by the peat fire sat an old woman knitting busily, a collie dog at her feet. \n \n There could be nothing to fear from her, so I knocked boldly at the door. The collie flew to the back of it barking furiously, but I heard the old woman calling him back, and presently she peeped out, asking who was there. \n \n \"\u0027Tis I, Jock Armstrong of Kinmont,\" I said, \"and I fain would be guided as to the quickest road to Branksome Tower.\" \n \n The old woman peered over my head into the darkness, evidently expecting to see someone standing behind me. \n \n \"I ken Willie o\u0027 Kinmont; but he\u0027s a grown man,\" she said suspiciously, making as though she would shut the door. \n \n \"He\u0027s my father,\" I cried, vainly endeavouring to keep my voice steady, \"and—and—I have a message to carry from him to the Lord of Buccleuch at Branksome.\" I would fain have told the whole story, but I knew it was better to be cautious. I was still no distance from the English Border, and it would take away the last chance of saving my father\u0027s life, were Sakelde to get to know that word of his doings were like to reach the Scottish Warden\u0027s ears. \n \n \"Loshsake, laddie!\" exclaimed the old dame in astonishment, setting the door wide open so that the light might fall full on me, \"\u0027tis full twenty miles tae Branksome, an\u0027 it\u0027s a bad road ower the hills.\" \n \n \"But I have a pony,\" I said. \"\u0027Tis tied up down the roadway there, and the moon will rise.\" \n \n \"That it will in an hour or two, but all the same I misdoubt me that you\u0027ll lose your road. What\u0027s the matter wi\u0027 Kinmont Willie, that he has tae send a bairn like you his messages? Ye needna\u0027 be feared to speak out,\" she added as I hesitated; \"Kinmont Willie is a friend of mine—at least, he did my goodman and me a good turn once—and I would like to pay it back again if I could.\" \n \n I needed no second bidding; it was such a relief to have someone to share the burden, and I felt better as soon as I had told her, even although the telling brought the tears to my eyes. \n \n The old woman listened attentively, and then shook her fist in the direction which the English had taken. \n \n \"He\u0027s a fause loon that Sakelde,\" she said, \"and I\u0027d walk to Carlisle any day to see him hanged. \u0027Twas he who stole our sheep, two years past at Martinmas, and \u0027twas your father brought them back again. But keep up your heart, my man; if you can get to the Bold Buccleuch he\u0027ll put things right, I\u0027ll warrant, and I\u0027ll do all I can for you. Go inbye, and sit down by the fire, and I\u0027ll go down the road and fetch the nag. You\u0027ll both be the better for a rest, and a bite o\u0027 something to eat, and when the moon is risen I\u0027ll take you up the hill, and show you the track. My goodman is away at Hawick market, or he would ha\u0027e ridden a bit of the road wi\u0027 ye.\" \n \n When I was a little fellow, before my mother died, she used to read me lessons out of her great Bible with the silver clasps, and of all the stories she read to me, I liked the lesson of the Good Samaritan best, and, looking back, now that I am a grown man, it seems to me that I met the Good Samaritan that night, only he was a woman. \n \n After Allison Elliot, for that was her name, had brought my pony into her cow-house, and seen that he was supplied with both hay and water, she returned to the cottage, and with her own hands took off my coarse woollen hose and heavy shoon, and spread them on the hearth to dry, then she made me lie down on the settle, and, covering me up with a plaid, she bade me go to sleep, promising to wake me the moment the moon rose. \n \n It was nearly eleven o\u0027clock when she shook me gently, bidding me get up and put on my shoon, as it was time to be going, and, sitting up, I found a supper of wheaten bread and hot milk on the table, which she told me to eat, while she wrapped herself in a plaid and went out for the nag. \n \n What with the sleep, and the dry clothes, and the warm food, I promise you I felt twice the man I had done a few hours earlier, and I chattered quite gaily to her as she led my pony up a steep hillside behind the cottage, for the moon was only beginning to rise, and there was still but little light. After we had gone some two miles, we struck a bridle track, well trodden by horses\u0027 hoofs, which wound upwards between two high hills. \n \n Here Allison paused and looked keenly at the ground. \n \n \"This is the path,\" she said; \"you can hardly lose it, for there have been riders over it yesterday or the day before. Scott o\u0027 Haining and his men, most likely, going home from their meeting at the Kershope Burn. This will lead you over by Priesthaugh Swire, and down the Allan into Teviotdale. Beware of a bog which you will pass some two miles on this side of Priesthaugh. \u0027Tis the mire Queen Mary stuck in when she rode to visit her lover when he lay sick at Hermitage. May the Lord be good to you, laddie, and grant you a safe convoy, for ye carry a brave heart in that little body o\u0027 yours!\" \n \n I thanked her with all my might, promising to go back and see her if my errand were successful; then I turned my pony\u0027s head to the hills, and spurred him into a brisk canter. He was a willing little beast, and mightily refreshed by Allison Elliot\u0027s hay, and, as the moon was now shining clearly, we made steady progress; but it was a long lonely ride for a boy of my age, and once or twice my courage nearly failed me: once when my pony put his foot into a sheep drain, and stumbled, throwing me clean over his head, and again when I missed the track, and rode straight into the bog Allison had warned me about, and in which the little beast was near sticking altogether, and I lost a good hour getting him to firm land and finding the track again. \n \n The bright morning sun was showing above the Eastern horizon before I left the weary hills behind me, but it was easy work to ride down the sloping banks of the Allan, and soon I came to the wooded valley of the Teviot. \n \n Urging on my tired pony, I cantered down the level haughs which lay by the river side, and it was not long before Branksome came in sight, a high square house, with many rows of windows, flanked by a massive square tower at each corner. \n \n I rode up to the great doorway through an avenue of beeches and knocked timidly on the wrought-iron knocker, for I had never been to such a big house in my life before, and I felt that I made but a sorry figure, splashed as I was with mud from head to foot. \n \n The old seneschal who came to the door seemed to think so too, for he looked me up and down with a broad grin on his face before he asked who I was, and on what business I had come. \n \n \"To see my Lord of Buccleuch, and carry a message to him from William Armstrong of Kinmont,\" I replied, with as much dignity as I could muster, for the fellow\u0027s smile angered me, and I feared that he might not think it worth his while to tell the Warden of my arrival. \n \n \"Then thou shalt see Sir Walter at once, young sir, if thou wilt walk this way,\" said the man, mimicking my voice good-naturedly, and, hitching my pony\u0027s bridle to an iron ring in the door-post, he led me along a stone passage, straight into a great vaulted hall, in the centre of which stood a long wooden table, with a smaller one standing crossways on a dais at its head. \n \n A crowd of squires and men-at-arms stood round the lower table, laughing and jesting as they helped themselves with their hunting knives to slices from the huge joints, or quaffed great tankards of ale, while up at the top sat my Lord of Buccleuch himself, surrounded by his knights, and waited on by smart pages in livery, boys about my own age. \n \n As the old seneschal appeared in the doorway there was a sudden silence, while he announced in a loud voice that a messenger had arrived from William Armstrong of Kinmont; but when he stepped aside, and everyone saw that the messenger was only a little eleven-years-old lad, a loud laugh went round the hall, and the smart pages whispered together and pointed to my muddy clothes. \n \n When the old seneschal saw this, he gave me a kindly nudge. \n \n \"Yonder is my Lord of Buccleuch at the top of the table,\" he whispered; \"go right up to him, and speak out thy message boldly.\" \n \n I did as I was bid, though I felt my cheeks burn as I walked up the great hall, among staring men and whispering pages, and when I reached the dais where the Warden sat, I knelt at his feet, cap in hand, as my father had taught me to do before my betters. \n \n Sir Walter Scott, Lord of Buccleuch, of whom I had heard so much, was a young, stern-looking man, with curly brown hair and keen blue eyes. His word was law on the Borders, and people said that even the King, in far-off Edinburgh, stood in awe of him; but he leant forward and spoke kindly enough to me. \n \n \"So thou comest from Armstrong of Kinmont, boy; and had Kinmont Willie no better messenger at hand, that he had to fall back on a smatchet like thee?\" \n \n \"There were plenty of men at Kinmont, an\u0027 it please your lordship,\" I answered, \"had I had time to seek them; but a man called Sakelde hath ta\u0027en my father prisoner, and carried him to Carlisle, and I have ridden all night to tell thee of it, for he is like to be hanged the day after to-morrow, if thou canst not save him.\" \n \n Here my voice gave way, and I could only cling to the great man\u0027s knee, for my quivering lips refused to say any more. \n \n Buccleuch put his arm round me, and spoke slowly, as one would speak to a bairn. \n \n \"And who is thy father, little man?\" \n \n \"Kinmont Willie,\" I gasped, \"and he was ta\u0027en last night, in truce time.\" \n \n I felt the arm that was round me stiffen, and there was silence for a moment, then my lord swore a great oath, and let his clenched fist fall so heavily on the table, that the red French wine which stood before him splashed right out of the beaker, a foot or two in the air. \n \n \"My Lord of Scroope shall answer for this,\" he cried. \"Hath he forgotten that men name me the Bold Buccleuch, and that I am Keeper o\u0027 the Scottish Marches, to see that justice is done to high and low, gentle and simple?\" \n \n Then he gave some quick, sharp orders, and ten or twelve men left the room, and a minute later I saw them, through a casement, throw themselves astride their horses, and gallop out of the courtyard. At the sight my heart lightened, for I knew that whatever could be done for my father would be done, for these men had gone to \"warn the waters,\" or, in other words, to carry the tidings far and wide, and bid all the men of the Western Border be ready to meet their chief at some given trysting-place, and ride with him to the rescue. \n \n Meanwhile the Warden lifted me on his knee, and began asking me questions, while the pages gathered round, no longer jeering, but with wide-open eyes. \n \n \"Thou art a brave lad,\" he said at last, after I had told him the whole story, \"and, with thy father\u0027s permission, I would fain have thee for one of my pages. We must tell him how well thou hast carried the message, and ask him if he can spare thee for a year or two.\" \n \n At any other time my heart would have leapt at this unheard-of good fortune, for to be a page in the Warden\u0027s household was the ambition of every well-born lad on the Border; but at that moment I felt as if Buccleuch hardly realised my father\u0027s danger. \n \n \"But he is lodged in Carlisle Castle, and men say the walls are thick,\" I said anxiously, \"and it is garrisoned by my Lord Scroope\u0027s soldiers.\" \n \n The Warden laughed. \n \n \"We will teach my Lord Scroope that there is no bird\u0027s nest that the Bold Buccleuch dare not harry,\" he said, and, seeing the look on his face, I was content. \n \n Then, noticing how weary I was, he called one of the older pages, and bade him see that I had food and rest, and the boy, who had been one of the first to laugh before, but who now treated me with great respect, took me away to a little turret room which he shared with some of his fellows, and brought me a piece of venison pie, and then left me to go to sleep on his low pallet, promising to wake me when there were signs of the Warden and his men setting out. \n \n I must have slept the whole day, for the little room was almost dark again, and the rain was beating wildly on the casement, when the boy came back. \"My lord hath given orders for the horses to be saddled,\" he said, \"and the trysting-place is Woodhouselee. I heard one squire tell another in the hall, for as a rule we pages know nothing, and are only expected to do as we are bid. I know not if my lord means thee to ride with him, but I was sent up to fetch thee.\" \n \n It did not take me long to spring up and fasten my doublet, and follow my guide down to the great hall. Here all was bustle and confusion; men were standing about ready armed, making a hasty meal at the long table, which never seemed to be empty of its load of food, while outside in the courtyard some fifty or sixty horses were standing, ready saddled, with bags of fodder thrown over their necks. \n \n Every few minutes a handful of men would ride up in the dusk, and, leaving their rough mountain ponies outside, would stride into the hall, and begin to eat as hard as they could, exchanging greetings between the mouthfuls. These were men from the neighbourhood, my friend informed me, mostly kinsmen of Buccleuch, and lairds in their own right, who had ridden to Branksome with their men to start with their chief. \n \n There was Scott of Harden, and Scott of Goldilands, Scott of Commonside, and Scott of Allanhaugh, and many more whom I do not now remember, and they drank their ale, and laughed and joked, as if they were riding to a wedding, instead of on an errand which might cost them their lives. \n \n Buccleuch himself was in the midst of them, booted and spurred, and presently his eye fell on me. \n \n \"Ha! my young cocksparrow,\" he cried. \"Wilt ride with us to greet thy father, or are thy bones too weary? Small shame \u0027twould be to thee if they were.\" \n \n \"Oh, if it please thee, sire, let me ride,\" I said; \"I am not too weary, if my pony is not,\" at which reply everyone laughed. \n \n \"I hear thy pony can scarce hirple on three legs,\" answered my lord, clapping me on my shoulder, \"but I like a lad of spirit, and go thou shalt. Here, Red Rowan, take him up in front of thee, and see that a horse be led for Kinmont to ride home on.\" \n \n I was about to protest that I was not a bairn to ride in front of any man, but Buccleuch turned away as if the matter were settled, and the big trooper who came up and took me in charge persuaded me to do as I was bid. \"\u0027Tis a dark night, laddie, and we ride fast,\" he said, \"and my lord would be angered didst thou lose thy way, or fall behind,\" and although my pride was nettled at first, I was soon fain to confess that he was right, for the horses swung out into the wind and rain, and took to the hills at a steady trot, keeping together in the darkness in a way that astonished me. Red Rowan had a plaid on his shoulders which he twisted round me, and which sheltered me a little from the driving rain, and I think I must have dozed at intervals, for it seemed no time until we were over the hills, and down at Woodhouselee in Canonbie, where a great band of men were waiting for us, who had gathered from Liddesdale and Hermitage Water. \n \n With scarcely a word they joined our ranks, and we rode silently and swiftly on, across the Esk, and the Graeme\u0027s country, until we reached the banks of the Eden. \n \n Here we came to a standstill, for the river was so swollen with the recent rains that it seemed madness for any man to venture into the rushing torrent; but men who had ridden so far, and on such an errand, were not to be easily daunted. \n \n \"This way, lads, and keep your horses\u0027 heads to the stream,\" shouted a voice, and with a scramble we were down the bank, and the nags were swimming for dear life. I confess now, that at that moment I thought my last hour had come, for the swirling water was within an inch of my toes, and I clung to Red Rowan\u0027s coat with all the strength I had, and shut my eyes, and tried to think of my prayers. But it was soon over, and on the other side we waited a minute to see if any man were missing. Everyone was safe, however, and on we went till we were close on Carlisle, and could see the lights of the Castle rising up above the city wall. \n \n Then Buccleuch called a halt, and everyone dismounted, and some forty men, throwing their bridle reins to their comrades, stepped to the front. Red Rowan was one of them, and I kept close to his side. \n \n Everything must have been arranged beforehand, for not a word was spoken, but by the light of a single torch the little band arranged themselves in order, while I watched with wide-open eyes. They were not all armed, but they all had their hands full. \n \n In the very front were ten men carrying hunting-horns and bugles; then came ten carrying three or four long ladders, which must have been brought with us on ponies\u0027 backs. Then came other ten, armed with great iron bars and forehammers; and only the last ten, among whom was the Warden himself and Red Rowan, were prepared as if for fighting. \n \n At the word of command they set out, with long steady strides, and as no one noticed me, I went too, running all the time in order to keep up with them. \n \n The Castle stood to the north side of the little city, close to the city wall, and the courtyard lay just below it. We stole up like cats in the darkness, fearful lest someone might hear us and give the alarm. Everyone seemed to be asleep, however, or else the roaring of the wind deadened the noise of our footsteps. In any case we reached the wall in safety, and as we stood at the bottom of it waiting till the men tied the ladders together, we could hear the sentries in the courtyard challenge as they went their rounds. \n \n At last the ladders were ready, and Buccleuch gave his whispered orders before they were raised. \n \n No man was to be killed, he said, if it could possibly be helped, as the two countries were at peace with each other, and he had no mind to stir up strife. All he wanted was the rescue of my father. \n \n Then the ladders were raised, and bitter was the disappointment when it was found that they were too short. For a moment it seemed as if we had come all the weary way for nothing. \n \n \"It matters not, lads,\" said the Warden cheerily; \"there be more ways of robbing a corbie\u0027s nest than one. Bide you here by the little postern, and Wat Scott and Red Rowan and I will prowl round, and see what we can see.\" \n \n Along with these two stalwart men he vanished, while we crouched at the foot of the wall and waited; nor had we long to wait. \n \n In ten minutes we could hear the bolts and bars being withdrawn, and the little door was opened by Buccleuch himself, who wore a triumphant smile. He had found a loophole at the back of the Castle left entirely unguarded, and without much difficulty he and his two companions had forced out a stone or two, until the hole was large enough for them to squeeze through, and had caught and bound the unsuspecting sentries as they came round, stuffing their mouths full of old clouts to hinder them from crying out and giving the alarm. \n \n Once we were inside the courtyard he ordered the men with the iron bars and forehammers to be ready to beat open the doors, and then he gave the word to the men with the bugles and hunting horns. \n \n Then began such a din as I had never heard before, and have never heard since. The bugles screeched, and the iron bars rang, and above all sounded the wild Border slogan, \"Wha dare meddle wi\u0027 me?\" which the men shouted with all their might. One would have thought that the whole men in Scotland were about the walls, instead of but forty. \n \n And in good faith the people of the Castle, cowards that they were, and even my Lord Scroope himself, thought that they were beset by a whole army, and after one or two frightened peeps from out of windows, and behind doors, they shut themselves up as best they might in their own quarters, and left us to work our will, and beat down door after door until we came to the very innermost prison itself, where my father was chained hand and foot to the wall like any dog. \n \n Just as the door was being burst open, my lord caught sight of me as I squeezed along the passage, anxious to see all that could be seen. He laid his hand on the men\u0027s shoulders and held them back. \n \n \"Let the bairn go first,\" he said; \"it is his right, for he has saved him.\" \n \n Then I darted across the cell, and stood at my father\u0027s side. What he said to me I never knew, only I saw that strange look once more on his face, and his eyes were very bright. Had he been a bairn or a woman I should have said he was like to weep. It was past in a moment, for there was little time to lose. At any instant the garrison might find out how few in numbers we were, and sally out to cut us off, so no time was wasted in trying to strike his chains off him. \n \n With an iron bar Red Rowan wrenched the ring to which he was fastened, out of the wall, and, raising him on his back, carried him bodily down the narrow staircase, and out through the courtyard. \n \n As we passed under my Lord Scroope\u0027s casement, my father, putting all his strength into his voice, called out a lusty \"good night\" to his lordship, which was echoed by the men with peals of laughter. \n \n Then we hurried on to where the main body of troopers were waiting with the horses, and I warrant the shout that they raised when they saw us coming with my father in the midst of us, riding on Red Rowan\u0027s shoulder, might almost have been heard at Branksome itself. \n \n When it died away we heard another sound which warned us that the laggards at the Castle had gathered their feeble courage, and were calling on the burghers of Carlisle to come to their aid, for every bell in the city was ringing, and we could see the flash of torches here and there. \n \n Scarcely had the smiths struck the last fetter from my father\u0027s limbs than we heard the thunder of horses\u0027 hoofs behind us. \n \n \"To horse, lads,\" cried Buccleuch, and in another moment we were galloping towards the Eden, I in front of Red Rowan as before, and close to my father\u0027s side. \n \n The English knew the lie of the land better than we did, for they were at the river before us, well-nigh a thousand of them, with Lord Scroope himself at their head. Apparently they never dreamed that we would attempt to swim the torrent, and thought we would have to show fight, for they were drawn up as if for a battle; but we dashed past them with a yell of defiance, and plunged into the flooded river, and once more we came safe to the other side. Once there we faced round, but the English made no attempt to follow; they sat on their horses, glowering at us in the dim light of the breaking day, but they said never a word. \n \n Then my Lord of Buccleuch raised himself in his stirrups, and, plucking off his right glove, he flung it with all his might across the river, and, the wind catching it, it was blown right into their leader\u0027s face. \"Take that, my Lord of Scroope,\" he cried; \"mayhap \u0027twill cure thee of thy treachery, for if Sakelde took him, \u0027twas thou who harboured him, and if thou likest not my mode of visiting at thy Castle of Carlisle, thou canst call and lodge thy complaint at Branksome at thy leisure.\" \n \n Then, with a laugh, he turned his horse\u0027s head and led us homewards, as the sun was rising and the world was waking up to another day. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2359/65852.html","bookId":588,"book":{"id":588,"title":"Tales From Scottish Ballads","description":"简介： Once upon a time, there was an old man in Lochmaben, who made his livelihood by going round the country playing on his harp.
