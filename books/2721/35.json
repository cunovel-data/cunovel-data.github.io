Because stupid villains are so boring, he answered himself, and was ashamed of it when he saw the despair on the women’s faces.\n \"So you see, it’s entirely up to you!\" The strained voice still had something of the slushy sweetness for which Capricorn had loved it so much. \"Help me to catch the bird that the Adderhead longs to hear singing in his castle, and you can keep your children. Otherwise He wearily signed to the guards, and the Milksop, his face rigid with fury, rode toward the gates as they opened. \"Otherwise, I am afraid I’ll have to remember that there is indeed always a need for small hands in our silver mines.\n The women were still staring at him with faces as empty of emotion as if there simply were no room in them for yet more despair.\n \"What are you still standing there for?\" called the Piper as the servants carried the Milksop’s dead game through the gateway below. \"Go away! Or I’ll have boiling water poured over you. Not a bad idea at all, since I’m sure you could all do with a bath.\"\n As if numbed, the women moved back, looking up at the battlements as though the cauldrons were already heating up.\n The last time Fenoglio’s heart had raced like this was when the soldiers had appeared in Balbulus’s workshop to take Mortimer away with them. He examined the faces of the women, the beggars crouching beside the pillory outside the castle walls, the frightened children, and fear spread through him. All the rewards set on Mortimer’s head had not yet been able to buy the Silver Prince an informer in Ombra, but what now? What mother would not betray the Bluejay for her own child’s sake?\n A beggar pushed his way through the crowd of women, and as he limped past Fenoglio recognized him as one of the Black Prince’s spies. Good, he thought.\n Mortimer will soon know about the deal the Piper has offered the women of Ombra.\n But then what?\n The Milksop’s hunting party was moving on through the open castle gates, and the women set off for home, heads lowered, as if already ashamed of the act of betrayal the Piper had demanded of them.\n \"Fenoglio?\" A woman stopped in front of him. He didn’t know who she was until she pushed back the scarf that she had tied over her pinned-up hair like a peasant woman.\n \"Resa? What are you doing here?\" Fenoglio instinctively looked around in alarm, but Mortimer’s wife had obviously come without her husband.\n \"I’ve been looking for you everywhere!\"\n Despina clung around Fenoglio’s neck and stared curiously at the strange woman.\n \"That lady looks like Meggie,\" she whispered to him.\n \"Yes, because she’s Meggie’s mother.\" Fenoglio put Despina down as Minerva came toward him. She was walking slowly, as if she felt dizzy, and Ivo ran to her and put his arm protectively around her.\n \"Fenoglio!\" Resa took his arm. \"I have to speak to you!\" What about? It couldn’t be anything good.\n \"Minerva, you go ahead,\" he said. \"It will be all right, wait and see,\" he added, but Minerva just looked at him as if he were one of her children. Then she took Despina’s hand and followed her son, who was running on ahead. She walked as unsteadily as if the Piper’s words were splinters of glass under her feet.\n \"Tell me your husband is hidden deep, deep in the forest and not planning any more idiocy like that visit to Balbulus!\" Fenoglio whispered to Resa as he led her away with him into Bakers’ Alley. It still smelled of fresh bread and cake there, a tormenting aroma for most of the people of Ombra, who hadn’t been able to afford such delicacies for a long time.\n Resa covered her hair with the scarf again and looked around as if she were afraid the Piper had come down from the battlements and was following her, but only a thin cat slunk past. Once there had been a great many pigs in the streets, too, but they had been eaten long ago, most of them up at the castle.\n \"I need your help!\" Good God, how desperate she sounded! \"You must write us home again. You owe us that! It’s your songs that have put Mo in danger, and it’s getting worse every day! You heard what the Piper said!\"\n \"Stop, stop, stop!\" He blamed himself often enough these days, but Fenoglio still didn’t like to be blamed by others. And this accusation really was surely unjust. \"I never brought Mortimer here, Orpheus did. I really couldn’t foresee that my inspiration for the Bluejay would suddenly be walking around here in flesh and blood!\"\n \"But it happened!\" One of the night watchmen who lit the lanterns was coming down the street. Darkness fell fast in Ombra. Another banquet would soon be beginning in the castle, and Sootbird’s fire would stink to high heaven.\n \"If you won’t do it for me,\" said Resa, doing her best to sound composed, but Fenoglio could see the tears in her eyes, \"then do it for Meggie. . . and the brother or sister she’s soon going to have.\"\n Another child? Fenoglio instinctively glanced at Resa’s belly as if he could already see a new character in the story there. Was there no end to its complications?\n \"Fenoglio, please!\"\n What was he to say in reply? Should he tell her about the sheet of paper still lying blank on his table — or even admit that he liked the way her husband played the part he had written for him, that the Bluejay was his sole comfort in these dark days, the only one of his ideas that worked really well? No, better not.\n \"Did Mortimer send you?\"\n She avoided his eyes.\n \"Resa, does he want to leave, too?\" Leave this world of mine? he added in his thoughts. My world, still magnificent even if it’s in a certain amount of turmoil at the moment? For, yes, Fenoglio knew only too well that he himself still loved it, despite its darkness. Perhaps because of its darkness. No. No, that wasn’t why. . . or was it?\n \"He must leave! Can’t you see that?\" The last of the daylight was fading from the streets. The buildings stood very close together, and it was cold and as still as if all Ombra were thinking of the Piper’s threat. Shivering, Resa drew her cloak around her. \"Your words.. . they’re changing him!\"\n \"Oh, come on. Words don’t change anyone!\" Fenoglio’s voice sounded louder than he had intended. \"Maybe my words have taught your husband things about himself he never knew before, but they were there all the time, and if he likes them now you can hardly call it my fault! Ride back, tell him what the Piper offered, say he’d better avoid anything like that visit to Balbulus in the near future, and for God’s sake don’t worry. He’s playing his part very well! He plays it better than any of the other characters I made up, except maybe the Black Prince. Your husband is a hero in this world! What man wouldn’t wish for that?\"\n The way she was looking at him, as if he were an old fool who didn’t know what he was talking about! \"You know very well how heroes end up,\" she said, carefully controlling her voice. \"They don’t have wives or children, and they don’t grow old.\n Find yourself another man to play the hero in your story, but leave my husband out of it! You must write us all back! Tonight!\"\n He hardly knew where to look. Her gaze was so clear—just like her daughter’s.\n Meggie had always looked at him like that. A candle flared into life in the window above them. His world was sinking into darkness. Night was falling — close the curtains, tomorrow the story will go on. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inkdeath-inkworld-3/page-35.html","bookId":2721,"book":{"id":2721,"title":"Inkdeath (Inkworld #3)","description":"Storyline: \n CAUGHT BETWEEN THE COVERS OF A CURSED STORY... \n Ever since the extraordinary events of Inkspell, when the enchanted book Inkheart drew Meggie and her father, Mo, into its chapters, life in the Inkworld has been more tragic than magical. \n The fire-eater Dustfinger is dead, having sacrificed his life for his apprentice Farid\u0027s, and now, under the rule of the evil Adderhead, the fairy-tale land is in bloody chaos, its characters far beyond the control of Fenoglio, their author.
