{"id":78443,"no":49,"title":"Page 49","content":"\"Why two?\" asked Mo hoarsely. \"How can you ask for two lives in return for one?\\n\\n Take mine, that’s enough.\"\\n\\n But the marten only stared at him. \"I fix the price,\" it said. \"All you have to do is pay it.\"\\n\\n Meggie. No. No. Go back, Resa, Mo thought. Get Meggie to read what Orpheus wrote and go back! Anything is better than this. Go back! Quickly!\\n\\n But the marten laughed. And once again it sounded like an old woman’s laughter.\\n\\n \"All stories end with me, Bluejay,\" Death said. \"You will find me everywhere.\" And as if to prove it, the marten turned into the one-eared cat that liked to steal into Elinor’s garden to hunt her birds. The cat jumped nimbly off Dustfinger’s breast and rubbed around Mo’s legs. \"Well, what do you say, Bluejay? Do you accept my conditions?\"\\n\\n And I will take not only your life for the Adderhead’s but your daughter’s, too.\\n\\n Mo glanced at Dustfinger. His face looked so much more peaceful in death than it had in life. Had he met his younger daughter on the other side, and Cosimo, and Roxane’s first husband? Were all the dead in the same place?\\n\\n The cat sat down in front of him and stared at him.\\n\\n \"I accept,\" said Mo, so hoarsely that he could hardly make out his own words. \"But I make a condition, too: Give me the FireDancer to go with me. My voice stole ten years of his life. Let me give them back to him. And there’s another thing. . . . Don’t the songs say that the Adderhead’s death will come out of the fire?\"\\n\\n The cat crouched down. Fur fell red on the rotting leaves. Bones covered themselves with flesh and feathers again, and the gold-mocker with its bloodstained breast fluttered up to settle on Mo’s shoulder.\\n\\n \"You like to make what the songs say come true, do you?\" the bird whispered to him.\\n\\n \"Very well, I will give him to you. Let the Fire-Dancer live again. But if spring comes and the Adderhead is still immortal, his heart will stop beating at the same time as yours — and your daughter’s.\"\\n\\n Mo felt dizzy. He wanted to seize the bird and wring its golden neck to silence that voice, so old and pitiless, with irony in every word. Meggie. He almost stumbled as he went to Dustfinger’s side once more.\\n\\n This time the White Women were reluctant to make way for him.\\n\\n \"As you see, my daughters don’t like to let him go,\" said the old woman’s voice.\\n\\n \"Even though they know he will come back.\"\\n\\n Mo looked at the motionless body. The face was indeed so much more tranquil than it had been in life, and all of a sudden he wasn’t sure whether he was really doing Dustfinger a favor by calling him back.\\n\\n The bird was still on his shoulder, so light in weight, so sharp of claw.\\n\\n \"What are you waiting for?\" asked Death. \"Call him!\"\\n\\n And Mo obeyed.\\n\\n CHAPTER 26\\n\\n A FAMILIAR VOICE\\n\\n They had gone. Had left him alone with all the blue, that clashed with the red of the fire. Blue as the evening sky, blue as cranesbill flowers, blue as the lips of drowned men and the heart of a blaze burning with too hot a flame. Yes, sometimes it was hot in this world, too. Hot and cold, light and dark, terrible and beautiful, it was everything all at once. It wasn’t true that you felt nothing in the land of Death. You felt and heard and smelled and saw, but your heart remained strangely calm, as if it were resting before the dance began again.\\n\\n Peace. Was that the word?\\n\\n Did the guardians of this world feel it, too, or did they long for something else? The pain they didn’t know, the flesh they didn’t dwell in. Perhaps. Or perhaps not. He couldn’t tell from their faces. He saw both there: peace and longing, joy and pain. As if they knew about everything in this world and the other, just as they themselves were made of every color at once, all the colors of the rainbow merging into white light. They told him that the land of Death had other places, too, darker than the one where they had brought him and where no one stayed for long except for him.\\n\\n Because he called up fire for them.\\n\\n The White Women both feared and loved fire. They warmed their pale hands at it, laughing like children when he made it dance for them. They were children, young and old at the same time, so old. They made him form trees and flowers of fire, a fiery sun and moon, but for himself he made the fire paint faces, the faces he saw when the White Women took him with them to the river where they washed the hearts of the dead. Look into it, they whispered to him. Look into it, then those who love you will see you in their dreams. And he leaned over the clear blue water and looked at the boy and the woman and the girl whose names he had forgotten, and saw them smiling in their sleep.\\n\\n Why don’t I know their names anymore? he asked.\\n\\n Because we’ve washed your heart, they said. Because we’ve washed it in the blue water that parts this world from the other one. It makes you forget.\\n\\n Yes. He supposed it did. For whenever he tried to remember he saw nothing but the blue, cool and caressing. It was only when he called up fire and its red glow spread that the pictures came again, the same pictures that he saw in the water. But his longing for them fell asleep before it had woken fully.\\n\\n What was my name? he sometimes asked, and then they laughed. Fire-Dancer, they whispered, that was your name and always will be, because you’ll stay with us for all eternity and never go away like all the others, away to another life. . .\\n\\n Sometimes they brought him a girl, a little girl. She stroked his face and smiled like the woman he saw in the water and the flames. Who’s that? he asked. She’s been here and went away again, they said. She was your daughter.\\n\\n Daughter.., the word sounded like pain, but his heart merely remembered and did not feel it. It felt only love, nothing but love. There was nothing else anymore.\\n\\n Where were they? They had never before left him alone, not once since he had come here. . . wherever here was.\\n\\n He had grown so used to the pale faces, to their beauty and their soft voices.\\n\\n But suddenly he heard another voice, very different from theirs. He knew it. And he knew the name it was calling.\\n\\n Dustfinger.\\n\\n He hated that voice . . . or did he love it? He didn’t know. He knew only one thing: It brought back everything he had forgotten —like a violent pain suddenly jolting his still heart into beating again. Hadn’t that voice caused him pain once before, so much pain that it almost broke his heart? Yes, he remembered! He pressed his hands to his ears, but in the world of the dead you don’t hear with your ears alone, and the voice made its way right inside him like fresh blood flowing into veins that had frozen long ago.\\n\\n \"Wake up, Dustfinger!\" it said. \"Come back. The story isn’t over yet.\\n\\n The story. . . He felt the blue pushing him away, he felt firm flesh surrounding him again, and a heart beating in a chest far too small for it.\\n\\n Silvertongue, he thought. It’s Silvertongue’s voice. And suddenly all the names came back to him: Roxane, Brianna, Farid. . . and the pain was back again, and time, and longing, too.\\n\\n CHAPTER 27\\n\\n LOST AND BACK AGAIN\\n\\n It was dark when Gwin woke Roxane. She still didn’t like the marten, but she couldn’t bring herself to chase him away. She had seen him sitting on Dustfinger’s shoulder too often. Sometimes she thought she still felt the warmth of his hands on Gwin’s brown coat. Since his master’s death the marten had allowed Roxane to stroke him. I-Ie never used to let her do that before. But he also used to kill her chickens before, and now he spared them, as if that were part of their unspoken agreement his thanks for her letting him, and no other living creature, follow her when she went to his master. Only Gwin shared her secret and kept her company when she sat beside the dead man for an hour, SOmetimes two, losing herself in the sight of his still face. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inkdeath-inkworld-3/page-49.html","bookId":2721,"book":{"id":2721,"title":"Inkdeath (Inkworld #3)","description":"Storyline: CAUGHT BETWEEN THE COVERS OF A CURSED STORY... \\n Ever since the extraordinary events of Inkspell, when the enchanted book Inkheart drew Meggie and her father, Mo, into its chapters, life in the Inkworld has been more tragic than magical. \\n The fire-eater Dustfinger is dead, having sacrificed his life for his apprentice Farid\u0027s, and now, under the rule of the evil Adderhead, the fairy-tale land is in bloody chaos, its characters far beyond the control of Fenoglio, their author.
