{"id":78402,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Did people die on the gallows too quickly for the White Women to come? Farid instinctively put his hand to his back, where Basta’s knife had gone in. They hadn’t come to him, had they? He didn’t remember. He didn’t even remember the pain, only Meggie’s face when he regained consciousness, and how he had turned to see Dustfinger lying there. . . . \"Why don’t you just write that they come and take me away instead of him?\" he had asked Orpheus, who merely laughed out loud. \"You?\\n\\n Do you seriously think the White Women would exchange the Fire-Dancer for a rascally thief like you? No, we’ll have to offer them tastier bait than that.\"\\n\\n The bags of silver jogged up and down beside Orpheus’s saddle as he spurred his horse on, and Oss’s face was so red with effort that it looked as if it would explode on his fleshy neck any moment now.\\n\\n Curses on Cheeseface! Yes, Meggie had better send him back to his own world, thought Farid as he dug his heels into the donkey’s sides. And the sooner the better!\\n\\n But who was going to write the words for her? And who but Orpheus could bring Dustfinger back from the dead?\\n\\n He’ll never come back, a voice whispered inside him. Dustfinger is dead, Farid.\\n\\n Dead.\\n\\n So? he snapped back at the quiet voice. What does that mean in this world? I came back, didn’t I?\\n\\n If only he could remember the way.\\n\\n CHAPTER 4\\n\\n INK-CLOTHES\\n\\n A new morning woke Meggie, with pale light that fell on her face and air as fresh as if no one had ever breathed it before. The fairies were twittering outside her window like birds that had learned to talk, and a blue jay screeched somewhere — if it really was a blue jay. The Strong Man could imitate any bird’s call so well that it sounded as if the real thing were nesting in his broad chest. And they all answered him: larks, mockingbirds, woodpeckers, nightingales, and Gecko’s tame crows.\\n\\n Mo was awake, too. She heard his voice outside - and her mother’s. Could Farid have come at last? She quickly rose from the straw mattress she slept on (what had sleeping in a bed felt like? She could hardly remember) and went to the window.\\n\\n She’d been waiting for Farid for days. He had promised to come.\\n\\n However, she saw no one out in the yard but her parents and the Strong Man, who smiled at her when he saw her standing at the window.\\n\\n Mo was helping Resa to saddle one of the horses that had been waiting in the stables when they first came here. The horses were so beautiful that they must once have belonged to one of the Milksop’s highborn friends, but as with many of the things the Black Prince brought, Meggie tried not to think too much about how they fell into the robbers’ hands. She loved the Black Prince, Battista, and the Strong Man, but some of the others sent a shudder down her spine. Men like Snapper and Gecko, for instance, although the same men had rescued her and her parents on Mount Adder.\\n\\n \"Robbers are robbers, Meggie,\" Farid often said. \"The Prince does what he does for other people, but several of his men just want to fill their pockets without having to toil in the fields or in a workshop.\" Farid . . . She missed him so much that she felt ashamed of it.\\n\\n Her mother was looking pale. Resa had often been sick over the last few days. That must be why she wanted to ride over and see Roxane. No one knew what to do in such cases better than Dustfinger’s widow, except perhaps for the Barn Owl, but he himself hadn’t been particularly well since the death of Dustfinger, and especially since the Adderhead had burned down the infirmary he’d run for so many years on the other side of the forest. No one knew what had become of Bella and all the other healers there.\\n\\n A mouse, horned like Dustfinger’s marten, scurried past as Meggie went outside, and a fairy whirred toward her and snatched at her hair, but by now Meggie knew just how to shoo them away. The colder the weather, the fewer fairies ventured out of their nests, but they were still on the hunt for human hair.\\n\\n \"Nothing keeps them warmer,\" Battista always said. \"Except for bears’ hair, and it’s dangerous to pull that out.\"\\n\\n The morning was so cool that Meggie wrapped her arms around herself, shivering.\\n\\n The clothes the robbers had found for them weren’t as warm as the sweaters she’d have worn on a day like this in the other world, and she thought almost wistfully of the warm socks waiting for her in Elinor’s cupboards.\\n\\n Mo turned and smiled as she came toward him. He looked tired but happy to see her.\\n\\n He wasn’t sleeping much. Often he would work late into the night in his makeshift workshop, using the few tools that Fenoglio had found him. And he was always going out into the forest, either alone or with the Prince. He thought Meggie didn’t know, but several times when she had been standing by the window unable to sleep, waiting for Farid, she had seen the robbers come for him. They called to Mo with the blue jay’s cry. Meggie heard it almost every night.\\n\\n \"Are you feeling any better?\" She looked at her mother anxiously. \"Perhaps it was those mushrooms we found the other day.\"\\n\\n \"No, it definitely wasn’t the mushrooms.\" Resa looked at Mo and smiled. \"Roxane is sure to know a herb that will help. Would you like to come with me? Brianna might be there; she doesn’t work for Orpheus every day.\"\\n\\n Brianna. Why would Meggie want to see her? Because they were almost the same age? After Cosimo’s death and the massacre of Ombra’s menfolk, Her Ugliness had thrown Brianna out as a belated punishment for having favored Cosimo’s company over hers. So Brianna had come home to help Roxane in the fields at first, but now she was working for Orpheus. Just like Farid. By this time Orpheus had half a dozen maids. Farid said sarcastically that Cheeseface didn’t even have to comb his own thin hair anymore. Orpheus hired only beautiful girls, and Brianna was very beautiful, so beautiful that beside her Meggie felt like a duck next to a swan. To make it even worse, Brianna was Dustfinger’s daughter. \"So? I don’t even speak to her,\" Farid had said when Meggie asked about her. \"She hates me, just like her mother.\" Still, he saw Brianna almost every day.., and all the others. And it was almost two weeks since he had been to see Meggie.\\n\\n \"Well, are you coming with me?\" Resa was still looking inquiringly at her, and Meggie felt herself blushing as if her mother had overheard all her thoughts.\\n\\n \"No\" she said, \"no, I think I’d rather stay here. The Strong Man will be riding with you, won’t he?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" The Strong Man had made it his business to protect Meggie and Resa.\\n\\n Meggie wasn’t sure whether Mo had asked him to, or whether he simply did it to show his devotion to the Bluejay.\\n\\n Resa let him help her up onto the horse. She often complained of the difficulty of riding in a dress and how she’d much rather have worn men’s clothes in this world.\\n\\n \"I’ll be back before dark,\" she told Mo. \"And maybe Roxane will have something to help you sleep better at night, too.\"\\n\\n Then she disappeared among the trees with the Strong Man, and Meggie was alone with Mo, just as she had been in the old days when there were only the two of them.\\n\\n \"She really isn’t well!\"\\n\\n \"Don’t worry, Roxane will know what to do.\" Mo glanced at the old bakehouse that he had made into his workshop. What were those black clothes he was wearing?\\n\\n Meggie wondered. \"I have to go out myself, but I’ll be back this evening. Gecko and Battista are in the stables, and the Prince is going to send Woodenfoot to be here, too, while the Strong Man’s gone. Those three will look after you better than I can.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inkdeath-inkworld-3/page-7.html","bookId":2721,"book":{"id":2721,"title":"Inkdeath (Inkworld #3)","description":"Storyline: CAUGHT BETWEEN THE COVERS OF A CURSED STORY... \\n Ever since the extraordinary events of Inkspell, when the enchanted book Inkheart drew Meggie and her father, Mo, into its chapters, life in the Inkworld has been more tragic than magical. \\n The fire-eater Dustfinger is dead, having sacrificed his life for his apprentice Farid\u0027s, and now, under the rule of the evil Adderhead, the fairy-tale land is in bloody chaos, its characters far beyond the control of Fenoglio, their author.
