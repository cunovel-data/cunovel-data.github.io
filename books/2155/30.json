{"id":97173,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"\"This is a good place for us,\" he\u0027d said, pointing out that the windtrap still functioned. \"Our friends have left us some water.\"\n They were a small band now, sixty people in all. The old, the sick, and the very young had been filtered south into the palmyries, absorbed there by trusted families. Only the toughest remained, and they had many friends to the north and the south.\n Ghanima wondered why Stilgar refused to discuss what was happening to the planet. Couldn\u0027t he see it? As qanats were shattered, Fremen pulled back to the northern and southern lines which once had marked the extent of their holdings. This movement could only signal what must be happening to the Empire. One condition was the mirror of the other.\n Ghanima ran a hand under the collar of her stillsuit and resealed it. Despite her worries she felt remarkably free here. The inner lives no longer plagued her, although she sometimes felt their memories inserted into her consciousness. She knew from those memories what this desert had been once, before the work of the ecological transformation. It had been drier, for one thing. That unrepaired windtrap still functioned because it processed moist air.\n Many creatures which once had shunned this desert ventured to live here now. Many in the band remarked how the daylight owls proliferated. Even now, Ghanima could see antbirds. They jigged and danced alone the insect lines which swarmed in the damp sand at the end of the shattered qanat! Few badgers were to be seen out here, but there were kangaroo mice in uncounted numbers.\n Superstitious fear ruled the new Fremen, and Stilgar was no better than the rest. This djedida had been given back to the desert after its qanat had been shattered a fifth time in eleven months. Four times they\u0027d repaired the ravages of the Desert Demon, then they\u0027d no longer had the surplus water to risk another loss.\n It was the same all through the djedidas and in many of the old sietches. Eight out of nine new settlements had been abandoned. Many of the old sietch communities were more crowded than they had ever been before. And while the desert entered this new phase, Fremen reverted to their old ways. They saw omens in everything. Were worms increasingly scarce except in the Tanzerouft? It was the judgment of Shai-Hulud! And dead worms had been seen with nothing to say why they died. They went back to desert dust swiftly after death, but those crumbling hulks which Fremen chanced upon filled the observers with terror.\n Stilgar\u0027s band had encountered such a hulk the previous month and it had taken four days for them to shake off the feeling of evil. The thing had reeked of sour and poisonous putrefaction. Its moldering hulk had been found sitting on top of a giant spiceblow, the spice mostly ruined.\n Ghanima turned from observing the qanat and looked back at the djedida. Directly in front of her lay a broken wall which once had protected a mushtamal, a small garden annex. She\u0027d explored the place with a firm dependence upon her own curiosity and had found a store of flat, unleavened spicebread in a stone box.\n Stilgar had destroyed it, saying: \"Fremen would never leave good food behind them.\"\n Ghanima had suspected he was mistaken, but it hadn\u0027t been worth the argument or the risk. Fremen were changing. Once they\u0027d moved freely across the bled, drawn by natural needs: water, spice, trade. Animal activities had been their alarm clocks. But animals moved to strange new rhythms now while most Fremen huddled close in their old cave-warrens within the shadow of the northern Shield Wall. Spice-hunters in the Tanzerouft were rare, and only Stilgar\u0027s band moved in the old ways.\n She trusted Stilgar and his fear of Alia. Irulan reinforced his arguments now, reverting to odd Bene Gesserit musings. But on faraway Salusa, Farad\u0027n still lived. Someday there would have to be a reckoning.\n Ghanima looked up at the grey-silver morning sky, questing in her mind. Where was help to be found? Where was there someone to listen when she revealed what she saw happening all around them? The Lady Jessica stayed on Salusa, if the reports were to be believed. And Alia was a creature on a pedestal, involved only in being colossal while she drifted farther and farther from reality. Gurney Halleck was nowhere to be found, although he was reported seen everywhere. The Preacher had gone into hiding, his heretical rantings only a fading memory.\n And Stilgar.\n She looked across the broken wall to where Stilgar was helping repair the cistern. Stilgar reveled in his role as the will-o\u0027-the-desert, the price upon his head growing monthly.\n Nothing made sense anymore. Nothing.\n Who was this Desert Demon, this creature able to destroy qanats as though they were false idols to be toppled into the sand? Was it a rogue worm? Was it a third force in rebellion - many people? No one believed it was a worm. The water would kill any worm venturing against a qanat. Many Fremen believed the Desert Demon was actually a revolutionary band bent on overthrowing Alia\u0027s Mahdinate and restoring Arrakis to its old ways. Those who believed this said it would be a good thing. Get rid of that greedy apostolic succession which did little else than uphold its own mediocrity. Get back to the true religion which Muad\u0027Dib had espoused.\n A deep sigh shook Ghanima. Oh, Leto, she thought. I\u0027m almost glad you didn\u0027t live to see these days. I\u0027d join you myself, but I\u0027ve a knife yet unblooded. Alia and Farad\u0027n. Farad\u0027n and Alia. The Old Baron\u0027s her demon, and that can\u0027t be permitted.\n Harah came out of the djedida, approaching Ghanima with a steady sand-swallowing pace. Harah stopped in front of Ghanima, demanded, \"What do you alone out here?\"\n \"This is a strange place, Harah. We should leave.\"\n \"Stilgar waits to meet someone here.\"\n \"Oh? He didn\u0027t tell me that.\"\n \"Why should he tell you everything? Maku?\" Harah slapped the water pouch which bulged the front of Ghanima\u0027s robe. \"Are you a grown woman to be pregnant?\"\n \"I\u0027ve been pregnant so many times there\u0027s no counting them,\" Ghanima said. \"Don\u0027t play those adult-child games with me!\"\n Harah took a backward step at the venom in Ghanima\u0027s voice.\n \"You\u0027re a band of stupids,\" Ghanima said, waving her hand to encompass the djedida and the activities of Stilgar and his people. \"I should never have come with you.\"\n \"You\u0027d be dead by now if you hadn\u0027t.\"\n \"Perhaps. But you don\u0027t see what\u0027s right in front of your faces! Who is it that Stilgar waits to meet here?\"\n \"Buer Agarves.\"\n Ghanima stared at her.\n \"He is being brought here secretly by friends from Red Chasm Sietch,\" Harah explained.\n \"Alia\u0027s little plaything?\"\n \"He is being brought under blindfold.\"\n \"Does Stilgar believe that?\"\n \"Buer asked for the parley. He agreed to all of our terms.\"\n \"Why wasn\u0027t I told about this?\"\n \"Stilgar knew you would argue against it.\"\n \"Argue against... This is madness!\"\n Harah scowled. \"Don\u0027t forget that Buer is...\"\n \"He\u0027s Family!\" Ghanima snapped. \"He\u0027s the grandson of Stilgar\u0027s cousin. I know. And the Farad\u0027n whose blood I\u0027ll draw one day is as close a relative to me. Do you think that\u0027ll stay my knife?\"\n \"We\u0027ve had a distrans. No one follows his party.\"\n Ghanima spoke in a low voice: \"Nothing good will come of this, Harah. We should leave at once.\"\n \"Have you read an omen?\" Harah asked. \"That dead worm we saw! Was that -\"\n \"Stuff that into your womb and give birth to it elsewhere!\" Ghanima raged. \"I don\u0027t like this meeting nor this place. Isn\u0027t that enough?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell Stilgar what you -\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell him myself!\" Ghanima strode past Harah, who made the sign of the worm horns at her back to ward off evil.\n But Stilgar only laughed at Ghanima\u0027s fears and ordered her to look for sandtrout as though she were one of the children. She fled into one of the djedida\u0027s abandoned houses and crouched in a corner to nurse her anger. The emotion passed quickly, though; she felt the stirring of the inner lives and remembered someone saying: \"If we can immobilize them, things will go as we plan.\"\n What an odd thought.\n But she couldn\u0027t recall who\u0027d said those words.\n Muad\u0027Dib was disinherited and he spoke for the disinherited of all time. He cried out against that profound injustice which alienates the individual from that which he was taught to believe, from that which seemed to come to him as a right. -The Mahdinate, An Analysis by Harq al-Ada\n Gurney Halleck sat on the butte at Shuloch with his baliset beside him on a spice-fiber rug. Below him the enclosed basin swarmed with workers planting crops. The sand ramp up which the Cast Out had lured worms on a spice trail had been blocked off with a new qanat. Plantings moved down the slope to hold it.\n It was almost time for the noon meal and Halleck had been on the butte for more than an hour, seeking privacy in which to think. Humans did the labor below him, but everything he saw was the work of melange. Leto\u0027s personal estimate was that spice production would fall soon to a stabilized one-tenth of its peak in the Harkonnen years. Stockpiles throughout the empire doubled in value at every new posting. Three hundred and twenty-one liters were said to have bought half of Novebruns Planet from the Metulli Family.\n The Cast Out worked like men driven by a devil, and perhaps they were. Before every meal, they faced the Tanzerouft and prayed to Shai-Hulud personified. That was how they saw Leto and, through their eyes, Halleck saw a future where most of humankind shared that view. Halleck wasn\u0027t sure he liked the prospect.\n Leto had set the pattern when he\u0027d brought Halleck and The Preacher here in Halleck\u0027s stolen \u0027thopter. With his bare hands Leto had breached the Shuloch qanat, hurling large stones more than fifty meters. When the Cast Out had tried to intervene, Leto had decapitated the first to reach him, using no more than a blurred sweep of his arm. He\u0027d hurled others back into their companions and had laughed at their weapons. In a demon-voice he\u0027d roared at them: \"Fire will not touch me! Your knives will not harm me! I wear the skin of Shai-Hulud!\"\n The Cast Out had recognized him then and recalled his escape, leaping from the butte \"directly to the desert.\" They\u0027d prostrated themselves before him and Leto had issued his orders. \"I bring you two guests. You will guard them and honor them. You will rebuild your qanat and begin planting an oasis garden. One day I\u0027ll make my home here. You will prepare my home. You will sell no more spice, but you will store every bit you collect.\"\n On and on he\u0027d gone with his instructions, and the Cast Out had heard every word, seeing him through fear-glazed eyes, through a terrifying awe.\n Here was Shai-Hulud come up from the sand at last!\n There\u0027d been no intimation of this metamorphosis when Leto had found Halleck with Ghadhean al-Fali in one of the small rebel sietches at Gare Ruden. With his blind companion, Leto had come up from the desert along the old spice route, traveling by worm through an area where worms were now a rarity. He\u0027d spoken of several detours forced upon him by the presence of moisture in the sand, enough water to poison a worm. They\u0027d arrived shortly after noon and had been brought into the stone-walled common room by guards.\n The memory haunted Halleck now.\n \"So this is The Preacher,\" he\u0027d said.\n Striding around the blind man, studying him, Halleck recalled the stories about him. No stillsuit mask hid the old face in sietch, and the features were there for memory to make its comparisons. Yes, the man did look like the old Duke for whom Leto had been named. Was it a chance likeness?\n \"You know the stories about this one?\" Halleck asked, speaking in an aside to Leto. \"That he\u0027s your father come back from the desert?\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard the stories.\"\n Halleck turned to examine the boy. Leto wore an odd stillsuit with rolled edges around his face and ears. A black robe covered it and sandboots sheathed his feet. There was much to be explained about his presence here - how he\u0027d managed to escape once more.\n \"Why do you bring The Preacher here?\" Halleck asked. \"In Jacurutu they said he works for them.\"\n \"No more. I bring him because Alia wants him dead.\"\n \"So? You think this is a sanctuary?\"\n \"You are his sanctuary.\"\n All this time The Preacher stood near them, listening but giving no sign that he cared which turn their discussion took.\n \"He has served me well, Gurney,\" Leto said. \"House Atreides has not lost all sense of obligation to those who serve us.\"\n \"House Atreides?\"\n \"I am House Atreides.\"\n \"You fled Jacurutu before I could complete the testing which your grandmother ordered,\" Halleck said, his voice cold. \"How can you assume -\"\n \"This man\u0027s life is to be guarded as though it were your own.\" Leto spoke as though there were no argument and he met Halleck\u0027s stare without flinching.\n Jessica had trained Halleck in many of the Bene Gesserit refinements of observation and he\u0027d detected nothing in Leto which spoke of other than calm assurance. Jessica\u0027s orders remained, though. \"Your grandmother charged me to complete your education and be sure you\u0027re not possessed.\"\n \"I\u0027m not possessed.\" Just a flat statement.\n \"Why did you run away?\"\n \"Namri had orders to kill me no matter what I did. His orders were from Alia.\"\n \"Are you a Truthsayer, then?\"\n \"I am.\" Another flat statement filled with self-assurance.\n \"And Ghanima as well?\"\n \"No.\"\n The Preacher broke his silence then, turning his blind sockets toward Halleck but pointing at Leto. \"You think you can test him?\"\n \"Don\u0027t interfere when you know nothing of the problem or its consequences,\" Halleck ordered, not looking at the man.\n \"Oh, I know its consequences well enough,\" The Preacher said. \"I was tested once by an old woman who thought she knew what she was doing. She didn\u0027t know, as it turned out.\"\n Halleck looked at him then. \"You\u0027re another Truthsayer?\"\n \"Anyone can be a Truthsayer, even you,\" The Preacher said. \"It\u0027s a matter of self-honesty about the nature of your own feelings. It requires that you have an inner agreement with truth which allows ready recognition.\"\n \"Why do you interfere?\" Halleck asked, putting hand to crysknife. Who was this Preacher?\n \"I\u0027m responsive to these events,\" The Preacher said. \"My mother could put her own blood upon the altar, but I have other motives. And I do see your problem.\"\n \"Oh?\" Halleck was actually curious now.\n \"The Lady Jessica ordered you to differentiate between the wolf and the dog, between ze\u0027eb and ke\u0027leb. By her definition a wolf is someone with power who misuses that power. However, between wolf and dog there is a dawn period when you cannot distinguish between them.\"\n \"That\u0027s close to the mark,\" Halleck said, noting how more and more people of the sietch had entered the common room to listen. \"How do you know this?\"\n \"Because I know this planet. You don\u0027t understand? Think how it is. Beneath the surface there are rocks, dirt, sediment, sand. That\u0027s the planet\u0027s memory, the picture of its history. It\u0027s the same with humans. The dog remembers the wolf. Each universe revolves around a core of being, and outward from that core go all of the memories, right out to the surface.\"\n \"Very interesting,\" Halleck said. \"How does that help me carry out my orders?\"\n \"Review the picture of your history which is within you. Communicate as animals would communicate.\"\n Halleck shook his head. There was a compelling directness about this Preacher, a quality which he\u0027d recognized many times in the Atreides, and there was more than a little hint that the man was employing the powers of Voice. Halleck felt his heart begin to hammer. Was it possible?\n \"Jessica wanted an ultimate test, a stress by which the underlying fabric of her grandson exposed itself,\" The Preacher said. \"But the fabric\u0027s always there, open to your gaze.\"\n Halleck turned to stare at Leto. The movement came of itself, compelled by irresistible forces.\n The Preacher continued as though lecturing an obstinate pupil. \"This young person confuses you because he\u0027s not a singular being. He\u0027s a community. As with any community under stress, any member of that community may assume command. This command isn\u0027t always benign, and we get our stories of Abomination. But you\u0027ve already wounded this community enough, Gurney Halleck. Can\u0027t you see that the transformation already has taken place? This youth has achieved an inner cooperation which is enormously powerful, that cannot be subverted. Without eyes I see this. Once I opposed him, but now I do his bidding. He is the Healer.\"\n \"Who are you?\" Halleck demanded.\n \"I\u0027m no more than what you see. Don\u0027t look at me, look at this person you were ordered to teach and test. He has been formed by crisis. He survived a lethal environment. He is here.\"\n \"Who are you?\" Halleck insisted.\n \"I tell you only to look at this Atreides youth! He is the ultimate feedback upon which our species depends. He\u0027ll reinsert into the system the results of its past performance. No other human could know that past performance as he knows it. And you consider destroying such a one!\"\n \"I was ordered to test him and I\u0027ve not -\"\n \"But you have!\"\n \"Is he Abomination?\"\n A weary laugh shook The Preacher. \"You persist in Bene Gesserit nonsense. How they create the myths by which men sleep!\"\n \"Are you Paul Atreides?\" Halleck asked.\n \"Paul Atreides is no more. He tried to stand as a supreme moral symbol while he renounced all moral pretensions. He became a saint without a god, every word a blasphemy. How can you think -\"\n \"Because you speak with his voice.\"\n \"Would you test me, now? Beware, Gurney Halleck.\"\n Halleck swallowed, forced his attention back to the impassive Leto who still stood calmly observant. \"Who\u0027s being tested?\" The Preacher asked. \"Is it, perhaps, that the Lady Jessica tests you, Gurney Halleck?\"\n Halleck found this thought deeply disturbing, wondering why he let this Preacher\u0027s words move him. But it was a deep thing in Atreides servants to obey that autocratic mystique. Jessica, explaining this, had made it even more mysterious. Halleck now felt something changing within himself, a something whose edges had only been touched by the Bene Gesserit training Jessica had pressed upon him. Inarticulate fury arose in him. He did not want to change!\n \"Which of you plays God and to what end?\" The Preacher asked. \"You cannot rely on reason alone to answer that question.\"\n Slowly, deliberately, Halleck raised his attention from Leto to the blind man. Jessica kept saying he should achieve the balance of kairits - \"thou shalt-thou shalt not.\" She called it a discipline without words and phrases, no rules or arguments. It was the sharpened edge of his own internal truth, all-engrossing. Something in the blind man\u0027s voice, his tone, his manner, ignited a fury which burned itself into blinding calmness within Halleck.\n \"Answer my question,\" The Preacher said.\n Halleck felt the words deepen his concentration upon this place, this one moment and its demands. His position in the universe was defined only by his concentration. No doubt remained in him. This was Paul Atreides, not dead, but returned. And this non-child, Leto. Halleck looked once more at Leto, really saw him. He saw the signs of stress around the eyes, the sense of balance in the stance, the passive mouth with its quirking sense of humor. Leto stood out from his background as though at the focus of a blinding light. He had achieved harmony simply by accepting it.\n \"Tell me, Paul,\" Halleck said. \"Does your mother know?\"\n The Preacher sighed. \"To the Sisterhood, all achieved harmony simply by accepting it.\"\n \"Tell me, Paul,\" Halleck said. \"Does your mother know?\"\n The Preacher sighed. \"To the Sisterhood, all of it, I am dead. Do not try to revive me.\"\n Still not looking at him, Halleck asked: \"But why does she -\"\n \"She does what she must. She makes her own life, thinking she rules many lives. Thus we all play god.\"\n \"But you\u0027re alive,\" Halleck whispered, overcome now by his realization, turning at last to stare at this man, younger than himself, but so aged by the desert that he appeared to carry twice Halleck\u0027s years.\n \"What is that?\" Paul demanded. \"Alive?\"\n Halleck peered around them at the watching Fremen, their faces caught between doubt and awe.\n \"My mother never had to learn my lesson.\" It was Paul\u0027s voice! \"To be a god can ultimately become boring and degrading. There\u0027d be reason enough for the invention of free will! A god might wish to escape into sleep and be alive only in the unconscious projections of his dream-creatures.\"\n \"But you\u0027re alive!\" Halleck spoke louder now.\n Paul ignored the excitement in his old companion\u0027s voice, asked: \"Would you really have pitted this lad against his sister in the test-Mashhad? What deadly nonsense! Each would have said: \u0027No! Kill me! Let the other live!\u0027 Where would such a test lead? What is it then to be alive, Gurney?\"\n \"That was not the test,\" Halleck protested. He did not like the way the Fremen pressed closer around them, studying Paul, ignoring Leto.\n But Leto intruded now. \"Look at the fabric, father.\"\n \"Yes... yes... \"Paul held his head high as though sniffing the air. \"It\u0027s Farad\u0027n, then!\"\n \"How easy it is to follow our thoughts instead of our senses,\" Leto said.\n Halleck had been unable to follow this thought and, about to ask, was interrupted by Leto\u0027s hand upon his arm. \"Don\u0027t ask, Gurney. You might return to suspecting that I\u0027m Abomination. No! Let it happen, Gurney. If you try to force it, you\u0027ll only destroy yourself.\"\n But Halleck felt himself overcome by doubts. Jessica had warned him. \"They can be very beguiling, these pre-born. They have tricks you\u0027ve never even dreamed.\" Halleck shook his head slowly. And Paul! Gods below! Paul alive and in league with this question mark he\u0027d fathered!\n The Fremen around them could no longer be held back. They pressed between Halleck and Paul, between Leto and Paul, shoving the two to the background. The air was showered with hoarse questions. \"Are you Muad\u0027Dib? Are you truly Muad\u0027Dib? Is it true, what he says? Tell us!\"\n \"You must think of me only as The Preacher,\" Paul said, pushing against them. \"I cannot be Paul Atreides or Muad\u0027Dib, never again. I\u0027m not Chani\u0027s mate or Emperor.\"\n Halleck, fearing what might happen if these frustrated questions found no logical answer, was about to act when Leto moved ahead of him. It was there Halleck first saw an element of the terrible change which had been wrought in Leto. A bull voice roared, \"Stand aside!\" - and Leto moved forward, thrusting adult Fremen right and left, knocking them down, clubbing them with his hands, wrenching knives from their hands by grasping the blades.\n In less than a minute those Fremen still standing were pressed back against the walls in silent consternation. Leto stood beside his father. \"When Shai-Hulud speaks, you obey,\" Leto said.\n And when a few of the Fremen had started to argue, Leto had torn a corner of rock from the passage wall beside the room\u0027s exit and crumbled it in his bare hands, smiling all the while.\n \"I will tear your sietch down around your faces,\" he said.\n \"The Desert Demon,\" someone whispered.\n \"And your qanats,\" Leto agreed. \"I will rip them apart. We have not been here, do you hear me?\"\n Heads shook from side to side in terrified submission.\n \"No one here has seen us,\" Leto said. \"One whisper from you and I will return to drive you into the desert without water.\"\n Halleck saw hands being raised in the warding gesture, the sign of the worm.\n \"We will go now, my father and I, accompanied by our old friend,\" Leto said. \"Make our \u0027thopter ready.\"\n And Leto had guided them to Shuloch then, explaining enroute that they must move swiftly because \"Farad\u0027n will be here on Arrakis very soon. And, as my father has said, then you\u0027ll see the real test, Gurney.\"\n Looking down from the Shuloch butte, Halleck asked himself once more, as he asked every day: \"What test? What does he mean?\"\n But Leto was no longer in Shuloch, and Paul refused to answer. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-30.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) \n The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
