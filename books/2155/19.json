{"id":97163,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"And Farad\u0027n reminded himself: A mentat thinks this.\n It gave the thought an added depth. Mentats made mistakes, but not often.\n Having come to this conclusion, Farad\u0027n almost summoned his aides to have them send the Lady Jessica away with Idaho. He poised himself on the point of acting, withdrew.\n Both of those people - the ghola-mentat and the Bene Gesserit witch - remained counters of unknown denomination in this game of power. Idaho must be sent back because that would certainly stir up troubles on Arrakis. Jessica must be kept here, drained of her strange knowledge to benefit House Corrino.\n Farad\u0027n knew it was a subtle and deadly game he played. But he had prepared himself for this possibility over the years, ever since he\u0027d realized that he was more intelligent, more sensitive than those around him. It had been a frightening discovery for a child, and he knew the library had been his refuge as well as his teacher.\n Doubts ate at him now, though, and he wondered if he was quite up to this game. He\u0027d alienated his mother, lost her counsel, but her decisions had always been dangerous to him. Tigers! Their training had been an atrocity and their use had been stupidity. How easy they were to trace! She should be thankful to suffer nothing more than banishment. The Lady Jessica\u0027s advice had fitted his needs with a lovely precision there. She must be made to divulge the way of that Atreides thinking.\n His doubts began to fade away. He thought of his Sardaukar once more growing tough and resilient through the rigorous training and the denial of luxury which he commanded. His Sardaukar legions remained small, but once more they were a man-to-man match for the Fremen. That served little purpose as long as the limits imposed by the Treaty of Arrakeen governed the relative size of the forces. Fremen could overwhelm him by their numbers - unless they were tied up and weakened by civil war.\n It was too soon for a battle of Sardaukar against Fremen. He needed time. He needed new allies from among the discontented Houses Major and the newly powerful from the Houses Minor. He needed access to CHOAM financing. He needed the time for his Sardaukar to grow stronger and the Fremen to grow weaker.\n Again Farad\u0027n looked at the screen which revealed the patient ghola. Why did Idaho want to see the Lady Jessica at this time? He would know they were spied upon, that every word, every gesture would be recorded and analyzed.\n Why?\n Farad\u0027n glanced away from the screen to the ledge beside his control console. In the pale electronic light he could make out the spools which contained the latest reports from Arrakis. His spies were thorough; he had to give them credit. There was much to give him hope and pleasure in those reports. He closed his eyes, and the high points of those reports passed through his mind in the oddly editorial form to which he\u0027d reduced the spools for his own uses:\n As the planet is made fertile, Fremen are freed of land pressures and their new communities lose the traditional sietch-stronghold character. From infancy, in the old sietch culture, the Fremen was taught by the rota: \"Like the knowledge of your own being, the sietch forms a firm base from which you move out into the world and into the universe. \"\n The traditional Fremen says: \"Look to the Massif,\" meaning that the master science is the Law. But the new social structure is loosening those old legal restrictions; discipline grows lax. The new Fremen leaders know only their Low Catechism of ancestry plus the history which is camouflaged in the myth structure of their songs. People of the new communities are more volatile, more open; they quarrel more often and are less responsive to authority. The old sietch folk are more disciplined, more inclined to group actions and they tend to work harder; they are more careful of their resources. The old folk still believe that the orderly society is the fulfillment of the individual. The young grow away from this belief. Those remnants of the older culture which remain look at the young and say: \"The death wind has etched away their past.\"\n Farad\u0027n liked the pointedness of his own summary. The new diversity on Arrakis could only bring violence. He had the essential concepts firmly etched into the spools:\n The religion of Muad\u0027Dib is based firmly in the old Fremen sietch cultural tradition while the new culture moves farther and farther from those disciplines.\n Not for the first time, Farad\u0027n asked himself why Tyekanik had embraced that religion. Tyekanik behaved oddly in his new morality. He seemed utterly sincere, but carried along as though against his will. Tyekanik was like one who had stepped into the whirlwind to test it and had been caught up by forces beyond his control. Tyekanik\u0027s conversion annoyed Farad\u0027n by its characterless completeness. It was a reversion to very old Sardaukar ways. He warned that the young Fremen might yet revert in a similar way, that the inborn, ingrained traditions would prevail.\n Once more Farad\u0027n thought about those report spools. They told of a disquieting thing: the persistence of a cultural remnant from the most ancient Fremen times - \"The Water of Conception.\" The amniotic fluid of the newborn was saved at birth, distilled into the first water fed to that child. The traditional form required a godmother to serve the water, saying: \"Here is the water of thy conception.\" Even the young Fremen still followed this tradition with their own newborn.\n The water of thy conception.\n Farad\u0027n found himself revolted by the idea of drinking water distilled from the amniotic fluid which had borne him. And he thought about the surviving twin, Ghanima, her mother dead when she\u0027d taken that strange water. Had she reflected later upon that odd link with her past? Probably not. She\u0027d been raised Fremen, What was natural and acceptable to Fremen had been natural and acceptable to her.\n Momentarily Farad\u0027n regretted the death of Leto II. It would have been interesting to discuss this point with him. Perhaps an opportunity would come to discuss it with Ghanima.\n Why did Idaho cut his wrists?\n The question persisted every time he glanced at the spy screen. Again doubts assailed Farad\u0027n. He longed for the ability to sink into the mysterious spice trance as Paul Muad\u0027Dib had done, there to seek out the future and know the answers to his questions. No matter how much spice he ingested, though, his ordinary awareness persisted in its singular flow of now, reflecting a universe of uncertainties.\n The spy screen showed a servant opening the Lady Jessica\u0027s door. The woman beckoned Idaho, who arose from the bench and went through the door. The servant would file a complete report later, but Farad\u0027n, his curiosity once more fully aroused, touched another switch on his console, watched as Idaho entered the sitting room of the Lady Jessica\u0027s quarters.\n How calm and contained the mentat appeared. And how fathomless were his ghola eyes.\n Above all else, the mentat must be a generalist, not a specialist. It is wise to have decisions of great moment monitored by generalists. Experts and specialists lead you quickly into chaos. They are a source of useless nit picking, the ferocious quibble over a comma. The mentat-generalist, on the other hand, should bring to decision-making a healthy common sense. He must not cut himself off from the broad sweep of what is happening in his universe. He must remain capable of saying: \"There\u0027s no real mystery about this at the moment. This is what we want now. It may prove wrong later, but we\u0027ll correct that when we come to it.\" The mentat-generalist must understand that anything which we can identify as our universe is merely part of larger phenomena. But the expert looks backward; he looks into the narrow standards of his own specialty. The generalist looks outward; he looks for living principles, knowing full well that such principles change, that they develop. It is to the characteristics of change itself that the mentat-generalist must look. There can be no permanent catalogue of such change, no handbook or manual. You must look at it with as few preconceptions as possible, asking yourself: \"Now what is this thing doing?\" -The Mentat Handbook\n It was the day of the Kwisatz Haderach, the first Holy Day of those who followed Muad\u0027Dib. It recognized the deified Paul Atreides as that person who was everywhere simultaneously, the male Bene Gesserit who mingled both male and female ancestry in an inseparable power to become the One-with-All. The faithful called this day Ayil, the Sacrifice, to commemorate the death which made his presence \"real in all places.\"\n The Preacher chose the early morning of this day to appear once more in the plaza of Alia\u0027s temple, defying the order for his arrest which everyone knew had been issued. The delicate truce prevailed between Alia\u0027s Priesthood and those desert tribes which had rebelled, but the presence of this truce could be felt as a tangible thing which moved everyone in Arrakeen with uneasiness. The Preacher did not dispel that mood.\n It was the twenty-eighth day of official mourning for Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s son, six days following the memorial rite at Old Pass which had been delayed by the rebellion. Even the fighting had not stopped the Hajj, though. The Preacher knew the plaza would be heavily thronged on this day. Most pilgrims tried to time their stay on Arrakis to cross Ayil, \"to feel then the Holy Presence of the Kwisatz Haderach on His day.\"\n The Preacher entered the plaza at first light, finding the place already thronging with the faithful. He kept a hand lightly on the shoulder of his young guide, sensing the cynical pride in the lad\u0027s walk. Now, when the Preacher approached, people noticed every nuance of his behavior. Such attention was not entirely distasteful to the young guide. The Preacher merely accepted it as a necessity.\n Taking his stance on the third of the Temple\u0027s steps. The Preacher waited for the hush to come. When silence had spread like a wave through the throng and the hurrying footsteps of others come to listen could be heard at the plaza\u0027s limits, he cleared his throat. It was still morning-cold around him and lights had not yet come down into the plaza from the building tops. He felt the grey hush of the great square as he began to speak.\n \"I have come to give homage and to preach in the memory of Leto Atreides II,\" he said, calling out in that strong voice so reminiscent of a wormsman from the desert. \"I do it in compassion for all who suffer. I say to you what the dead Leto has learned, that tomorrow has not yet happened and may never happen. This moment here is the only observable time and place for us in our universe. I tell you to savor this moment and understand what it teaches. I tell you to learn that a government\u0027s growth and its death are apparent in the growth and death of its citizens.\"\n A disturbed murmur passed through the plaza. Did he mock the death of Leto II? They wondered if Priest Guards would rush out now and arrest The Preacher.\n Alia knew there would be no such interruption of The Preacher. It was her order that he be left unmolested on this day. She had disguised herself in a good stillsuit with a moisture mask to conceal her nose and mouth, and a common hooded robe to hide her hair. She stood in the second row beneath The Preacher, watching him carefully. Was this Paul? The years might have changed him thus. And he had always been superb with Voice, a fact which made it difficult to identify him by his speech. Still, this Preacher made his voice do what he wanted. Paul could not have done it better. She felt that she had to know his identity before she could act against him. How his words dazzled her!\n She sensed no irony in The Preacher\u0027s statement. He was using the seductive attraction of definite sentences uttered with a driving sincerity. People might stumble only momentarily at his meanings, realizing that he had meant them to stumble, teaching them in this fashion. Indeed, he picked up the crowd\u0027s response, saying: \"Irony often masks the inability to think beyond one\u0027s assumptions. I am not being ironic. Ghanima has said to you that the blood of her brother cannot be washed off. I concur.\n \"It will be said that Leto has gone where his father went, has done what his father did. Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s Church says he chose in behalf of his own humanity a course which might appear absurd and foolhardy, but which history will validate. That history is being rewritten even now.\n \"I say to you that there is another lesson to be learned from these lives and their endings.\"\n Alia, alert to every nuance, asked herself why The Preacher said endings instead of deaths. Was he saying that one or both were not truly dead? How could that be? A Truthsayer had confirmed Ghanima\u0027s story. What was this Preacher doing, then? Was he making a statement of myth or reality?\n \"Note this other lesson well!\" The Preacher thundered, lifting his arms. \"If you would possess your humanity, let go of the universe!\"\n He lowered his arms, pointed his empty sockets directly at Alia. He seemed to be speaking intimately to her, an action so obvious that several around her turned to peer inquiringly in her direction. Alia shivered at the power in him. This could be Paul. It could!\n \"But I realize that humans cannot bear very much reality,\" he said. \"Most lives are a flight from selfhood. Most prefer the truths of the stable. You stick your heads into the stanchions and munch contentedly until you die. Others use you for their purposes. Not once do you live outside the stable to lift your head and be your own creature. Muad\u0027Dib came to tell you about that. Without understanding his message, you cannot revere him!\"\n Some in the throng, possibly a Priest in disguise, could stand no more. His hoarse male voice was lifted in a shout: \"You don\u0027t live the life of Muad\u0027Dib! How dare you to tell others how they must revere him!\"\n \"Because he\u0027s dead!\" The Preacher bellowed.\n Alia turned to see who had challenged The Preacher. The man remained hidden from her, but his voice came over the intervening heads in another shout: \"If you believe him truly dead, then you are alone from this time forward!\"\n Surely it was a Priest, Alia thought. But she failed to recognize the voice.\n \"I come only to ask a simple question,\" The Preacher said. \"Is Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s death to be followed by the moral suicide of all men? Is that the inevitable aftermath of a Messiah?\"\n \"Then you admit him Messiah!\" the voice from the crowd shouted.\n \"Why not, since I\u0027m the prophet of his times?\" The Preacher asked.\n There was such calm assurance in his tone and manner that even his challenger fell silent. The crowd responded with a disturbed murmur, a low animal sound.\n \"Yes,\" The Preacher repeated, \"I am the prophet of these times.\"\n Alia, concentrating on him, detected the subtle inflections of Voice. He\u0027d certainly controlled the crowd. Was he Bene Gesserit trained? Was this another ploy of the Missionaria Protectiva? Not Paul at all, but just another part of the endless power game?\n \"I articulate the myth and the dream!\" The Preacher shouted. \"I am the physician who delivers the child and announces that the child is born. Yet I come to you at a time of death. Does that not disturb you? It should shake your souls!\"\n Even as she felt anger at his words, Alia understood the pointed way of his speech. With others, she found herself edging closer up the steps, crowding toward this tall man in desert garb. His young guide caught her attention: how bright-eyed and saucy the lad appeared! Would Muad\u0027Dib employ such a cynical youth?\n \"I mean to disturb you!\" The Preacher shouted. \"It is my intention! I come here to combat the fraud and illusion of your conventional, institutionalized religion. As with all such religions, your institution moves toward cowardice, it moves toward mediocrity, inertia, and self-satisfaction.\"\n Angry murmurs began to arise in the center of the throng.\n Alia felt the tensions and gloatingly wondered if there might not be a riot. Could The Preacher handle these tensions? If not, he could die right here!\n \"That Priest who challenged me!\" The Preacher called, pointing into the crowd.\n He knows! Alia thought. A thrill ran through her, almost sexual in its undertones. This Preacher played a dangerous game, but he played it consummately.\n \"You, Priest in your mufti,\" The Preacher called, \"you are a chaplain to the self-satisfied. I come not to challenge Muad\u0027Dib but to challenge you! Is your religion real when it costs you nothing and carries no risk? Is your religion real when you fatten upon it? Is your religion real when you commit atrocities in its name? Whence comes your downward degeneration from the original revelation? Answer me, Priest!\"\n But the challenger remained silent. And Alia noted that the crowd once more was listening with avid submission to The Preacher\u0027s every word. By attacking the Priesthood, he had their sympathy! And if her spies were correct, most of the pilgrims and Fremen on Arrakis believed this man was Muad\u0027Dib.\n \"The son of Muad\u0027Dib risked!\" The Preacher shouted, and Alia heard tears in his voice. \"Muad\u0027Dib risked! They paid their price! And what did Muad\u0027Dib achieve? A religion which is doing away with him!\"\n How different those words if they come from Paul himself, Alia thought. I must find out! She moved closer up the steps and others moved with her. She pressed through the throng until she could almost reach out and touch this mysterious prophet. She smelled the desert on him, a mixture of spice and flint. Both The Preacher and his young guide were dusty, as though they\u0027d recently come from the bled. She could see where The Preacher\u0027s hands were deeply veined along the skin protruding from the wrist seals of his stillsuit. She could see that one finger of his left hand had worn a ring; the indentation remained. Paul had worn a ring on that finger: the Atreides Hawk which now reposed in Sietch Tabr. Leto would have worn it had he lived... or had she permitted him to ascend the throne.\n Again The Preacher aimed his empty sockets at Alia, spoke intimately, but with a voice which carried across the throng.\n \"Muad\u0027Dib showed you two things: a certain future and an uncertain future. With full awareness, he confronted the ultimate uncertainty of the larger universe. He stepped off blindly from his position on this world. He showed us that men must do this always, choosing the uncertain instead of the certain.\" His voice, Alia noted, took on a pleading tone at the end of this statement.\n Alia glanced around, slipped a hand onto the hilt of her crysknife. If I killed him right now, what would they do? Again, she felt a thrill rush through her. If I killed him and revealed myself, denouncing The Preacher as impostor and heretic!\n But what if they proved it was Paul?\n Someone pushed Alia even closer to him. She felt herself enthralled by his presence even as she fought to still her anger. Was this Paul? Gods below! What could she do?\n \"Why has another Leto been taken from us?\" The Preacher demanded. There was real pain in his voice. \"Answer me if you can! Ahhhh, their message is clear: abandon certainty.\" He repeated it in a rolling stentorian shout: \"Abandon certainty! That\u0027s life\u0027s deepest command. That\u0027s what life\u0027s all about. We\u0027re a probe into the unknown, into the uncertain. Why can\u0027t you hear Muad\u0027Dib? If certainty is knowing absolutely an absolute future, then that\u0027s only death disguised! Such a future becomes now! He showed you this!\"\n With a terrifying directness The Preacher reached out, grabbed Alia\u0027s arm. It was done without any groping or hesitation. She tried to pull away, but he held her in a painful grip, speaking directly into her face as those around them edged back in confusion.\n \"What did Paul Atreides tell you, woman?\" he demanded.\n How does he know I\u0027m a woman? she asked herself. She wanted to sink into her inner lives, ask their protection, but the world within remained frighteningly silent, mesmerized by this figure from their past.\n \"He told you that completion equals death!\" The Preacher shouted. \"Absolute prediction is completion... is death!\"\n She tried to pry his fingers away. She wanted to grab her knife and slash him away from her, but dared not. She had never felt this daunted in all of her life.\n The Preacher lifted his chin to speak over her to the crowd, shouted: \"I give you Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s words! He said, \u0027I\u0027m going to rub your faces in things you try to avoid. I don\u0027t find it strange that all you want to believe is only that which comforts you. How else do humans invent the traps which betray us into mediocrity? How else do we define cowardice?\u0027 That\u0027s what Muad\u0027Dib told you!\"\n Abruptly he released Alia\u0027s arm, thrust her into the crowd. She would have fallen but for the press of people supporting her.\n \"To exist is to stand out, away from the background,\" The Preacher said. \"You aren\u0027t thinking or really existing unless you\u0027re willing to risk even your own sanity in the judgment of your existence.\"\n Stepping down. The Preacher once more took Alia\u0027s arm - no faltering or hesitation. He was gentler this time, though. Leaning close, he pitched his voice for her ears alone, said: \"Stop trying to pull me once more into the background, sister.\"\n Then, hand on his young guide\u0027s shoulder, he stepped into the throng. Way was made for the strange pair. Hands reached out to touch The Preacher, but people reached with an awesome tenderness, fearful of what they might find beneath that dusty Fremen robe.\n Alia stood alone in her shock as the throng moved out behind The Preacher.\n Certainty filled her. It was Paul. No doubt remained. It was her brother. She felt what the crowd felt. She had stood in the sacred presence and now her universe tumbled all about her. She wanted to run after him, pleading for him to save her from herself, but she could not move. While others pressed to follow The Preacher and his guide, she stood intoxicated with an absolute despair, a distress so deep that she could only tremble with it, unable to command her own muscles.\n What will I do? What will I do? she asked herself.\n Now she did not even have Duncan to lean upon, nor her mother. The inner lives remained silent. There was Ghanima, held securely under guard within the Keep, but Alia could not bring herself to take this distress to the surviving twin.\n Everyone has turned against me. What can I do?\n The one-eyed view of our universe says you must not look far afield for problems. Such problems may never arrive. Instead, tend to the wolf within your fences. The packs ranging outside may not even exist. -The Azhar Book; Shamra I:4\n Jessica awaited Idaho at the window of her sitting room. It was a comfortable room with soft divans and old-fashioned chairs. There wasn\u0027t a suspensor in any of her rooms, and the glowglobes were crystal from another age. Her window overlooked a courtyard garden one story down.\n She heard the servant open the door, then the sound of Idaho\u0027s footsteps on the wood floor, then on the carpet. She listened without turning, kept her gaze upon the dappled light of the courtyard\u0027s green floor. The silent, fearful warfare of her emotions must be suppressed now. She took the deep breaths of her prana-bindu training, felt the outflow of enforced calmness.\n The high sun threw its searchlight along a dustbeam into the courtyard, highlighting the silver wheel of a spiderweb stretched in the branches of a linden tree which reached almost to her window. It was cool within her quarters, but outside the sealed window there was air which trembled with petrified heat. Castle Corrino sat in a stagnant place which belied the greens in her courtyard.\n She heard Idaho stop directly behind her.\n Without turning, she said: \"The gift of words is the gift of deception and illusion, Duncan. Why do you wish words with me?\"\n \"It may be that only one of us will survive,\" he said.\n \"And you wish me to make a good report of your efforts?\" She turned, saw how calmly he stood there, watching her with those grey metal eyes which held no center of focus. How blank they were!\n \"Duncan, is it possible that you\u0027re jealous of your place in history?\"\n She spoke accusingly and remembered as she spoke that other time when she\u0027d confronted this man. He\u0027d been drunk then, set to spy upon her, and was torn by conflicting obligations. But that had been a pre-ghola Duncan. This was not the same man at all. This one was not divided in his actions, not torn.\n He proved her summation by smiling. \"History holds its own court and delivers its own judgments,\" he said. \"I doubt that I\u0027ll be concerned when my judgment\u0027s handed down.\"\n \"Why are you here?\" she asked.\n \"For the same reason you\u0027re here, My Lady.\"\n No outward sign betrayed the shocking power of those simple words, but she reflected at a furious pace: Does he really know why I\u0027m here? How could he? Only Ghanima knew. Then had he enough data for a mentat computation? That was possible. And what if he said something to give her away? Would he do that if he shared her reason for being here? He must know their every movement, every word was being spied upon by Farad\u0027n or his servants.\n \"House Atreides has come to a bitter crossroads,\" she said. \"Family turned against itself. You were among my Duke\u0027s most loyal men, Duncan. When the Baron Harkonnen -\"\n \"Let us not speak of Harkonnens,\" he said, \"That was another age and your Duke is dead.\" And he wondered: Can\u0027t she guess that Paul revealed the Harkonnen blood in the Atreides? What a risk that had been for Paul, but it had bound Duncan Idaho even more firmly to him. The trust in the revelation had been a coin almost too great to imagine. Paul had known what the Baron\u0027s people had done to Idaho.\n \"House Atreides is not dead,\" Jessica said.\n \"What is House Atreides?\" he asked. \"Are you House Atreides? Is it Alia? Ghanima? Is it the people who serve this House? I look at those people and they bear the stamp of a travail beyond words! How can they be Atreides? Your son said it rightly: \u0027Travail and persecution are the lot of all who follow me.\u0027 I would break myself away from that, My Lady.\"\n \"Have you really gone over to Farad\u0027n?\"\n \"Isn\u0027t that what you\u0027ve done, My Lady? Didn\u0027t you come here to convince Farad\u0027n that a marriage to Ghanima would solve all of our problems?\"\n Does he really think that? she wondered. Or is he talking for the watchful spies?\n \"House Atreides has always been essentially an idea,\" she said. \"You know that, Duncan. We bought loyalty with loyalty.\"\n \"Service to the people,\" Idaho sneered. \"Ahhh, many\u0027s the time I\u0027ve heard your Duke say it. He must lie uneasy in his grave, My Lady.\"\n \"Do you really think us fallen that low?\"\n \"My lady, did you not know that there are Fremen rebels - they call themselves \u0027Marquis of the Inner Desert\u0027 - who curse House Atreides and even Muad\u0027Dib?\"\n \"I heard Farad\u0027n\u0027s report,\" she said, wondering where he was leading this conversation and to what point.\n \"More than that, My Lady. More than Farad\u0027n\u0027s report. I\u0027ve heard their curse myself. Here\u0027s the way of it: \u0027Burning be on you, Atreides! You shall have no souls, nor spirits, nor bodies, nor shades nor magic nor bones, nor hair nor utterances nor words. You shall have no grave, nor house nor hole nor tomb. You shall have no garden, nor tree nor bush. You shall have no water, nor bread nor light nor fire. You shall have no children, nor family nor heirs nor tribe. You shall have no head, nor arms nor legs nor gait nor seed. You shall have no seats on any planet. Your souls shall not be permitted to come up from the depths, and they shall never be among those permitted to live upon the earth. On no day shall you behold Shai-Hulud, but you shall be bound and fettered in the nethermost abomination and your souls shall never enter into the glorious light for ever and ever.\u0027 That\u0027s the way of the curse, My Lady. Can you imagine such hatred from Fremen? They consign all Atreides to the left hand of the damned, to the Woman-Sun which is full of burning.\"\n Jessica allowed herself a shudder. Idaho undoubtedly had delivered those words with the same voice in which he\u0027d heard the original curse. Why did he expose this to House Corrino? She could picture an outraged Fremen, terrible in his anger, standing before his tribe to vent that ancient curse. Why did Idaho want Farad\u0027n to hear it?\n \"You make a strong argument for the marriage of Ghanima and Farad\u0027n,\" she said.\n \"You always did have a single-minded approach to problems,\" he said. \"Ghanima\u0027s Fremen. She can marry only one who pays no fai, no tax for protection. House Corrino gave up its entire CHOAM holdings to your son and his heirs. Farad\u0027n exists on Atreides sufferance. And remember when your Duke planted the Hawk flag on Arrakis, remember what he said: \u0027Here I am; here I remain!\u0027 His bones are still there. And Farad\u0027n would have to live on Arrakis, his Sardaukar with him.\"\n Idaho shook his head at the very thought of such an alliance.\n \"There\u0027s an old saying that one peels a problem like an onion,\" she said, her voice cold. How dare he patronize me? Unless he\u0027s performing for Farad\u0027n\u0027s watchful eyes...\n \"Somehow, I can\u0027t see Fremen and Sardaukar sharing a planet,\" Idaho said. \"That\u0027s a layer which doesn\u0027t come off the onion.\"\n She didn\u0027t like the thoughts which Idaho\u0027s words might arouse in Farad\u0027n and his advisors, spoke sharply: \"House Atreides is still the law in this Empire!\" And she thought: Does Idaho want Farad\u0027n to believe he can regain the throne without the Atreides?\n \"Oh, yes,\" Idaho said. \"I almost forgot. Atreides Law! As translated, of course, by the Priests of the Golden Elixir. I have but to close my eyes and I hear your Duke telling me that real estate is always gained and held by violence or the threat of it. Fortune passes everywhere, as Gurney used to sing it. The end justifies the means? Or do I have my proverbs mixed up? Well, it doesn\u0027t matter whether the mailed fist is brandished openly by Fremen legions or Sardaukar, or whether it\u0027s hidden in the Atreides Law - the fist is still there. And the onion layer won\u0027t come off, My Lady. You know, I wonder which fist Farad\u0027n will demand?\"\n What is he doing? Jessica wondered. House Corrino would soak up this argument and gloat over it!\n \"So you think the Priests wouldn\u0027t let Ghanima marry Farad\u0027n?\" Jessica ventured, probing to see where Idaho\u0027s words might be leading.\n \"Let her? Gods below! The Priests will let Alia do whatever she decrees. She could marry Farad\u0027n herself!\"\n Is that where he\u0027s fishing? Jessica wondered.\n \"No, My Lady,\" Idaho said. \"That\u0027s not the issue. This Empire\u0027s people cannot distinguish between Atreides government and the government of Beast Rabban. Men die every day in Arrakeen\u0027s dungeons. I left because I could not give my sword arm another hour to the Atreides! Don\u0027t you understand what I\u0027m saying, why I came here to you as the nearest Atreides representative? The Atreides Empire has betrayed your Duke and your son. I loved your daughter, but she went one way and I went another. If it comes down to it, I\u0027ll advise Farad\u0027n to accept Ghanima\u0027s hand - or Alia\u0027s - only on his own terms!\"\n Ahhh, he sets the stage for a formal withdrawal with honor from Atreides service, she thought. But these other matters of which he spoke, could he possibly know how well they did her work for her? She scowled at him. \"You know spies are listening to every word, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Spies?\" He chuckled. \"They listen as I would listen in their place. Don\u0027t you know how my loyalties move in a different way? Many\u0027s the night I\u0027ve spent alone in the desert, and the Fremen are right about that place, in the desert, especially at night, you encounter the dangers of hard thinking.\"\n \"Is that where you heard Fremen curse us?\"\n \"Yes. Among the al-Ourouba. At The Preacher\u0027s bidding I joined them, My Lady. We call ourselves the Zarr Sadus, those who refuse to submit to the Priests. I am here to make formal announcement to an Atreides that I\u0027ve removed myself to enemy territory.\"\n Jessica studied him, looking for betrayals of minutiae, but Idaho gave no indication that he spoke falsely or with hidden plans. Was it really possible that he\u0027d gone over to Farad\u0027n? She was reminded of her Sisterhood\u0027s maxim: In human affairs, nothing remains enduring; all human affairs revolve in a helix, moving around and out. If Idaho had really left the Atreides fold, that would explain his present behavior. He was moving around and out. She had to consider this as a possibility.\n But why had he emphasized that he did The Preacher\u0027s bidding?\n Jessica\u0027s mind raced and, having considered alternatives, she realized she might have to kill Idaho. The plan upon which she had staked her hopes remained so delicate that nothing could be allowed to interfere with it. Nothing. And Idaho\u0027s words hinted that he knew her plan. She gauged their relative positions in the room, moving and turning to place herself in position for a lethal blow.\n \"I\u0027ve always considered the normalizing effect of the faufreluches to be a pillar of our strength,\" she said. Let him wonder why she shifted their conversation to the system of class distinction. \"The Landsraad Council of the Great Houses, the regional Sysselraads, all deserve our -\"\n \"You do not distract me,\" he said.\n And Idaho wondered at how transparent her actions had become. Was it that she had grown lax in concealment, or had he finally breached the walls of her Bene Gesserit training? The latter, he decided, but some of it was in herself - a changing as she aged. It saddened him to see the small ways the new Fremen differed from the old. The passing of the desert was the passing of something precious to humans and he could not describe this thing, no more than he could describe what had happened to the Lady Jessica.\n Jessica stared at Idaho in open astonishment, not trying to conceal her reaction. Could he read her that easily?\n \"You will not slay me,\" he said. He used the Fremen words of warning: \"Don\u0027t throw your blood upon my knife.\" And he thought: I\u0027ve become very much the Fremen. It gave him a wry sense of continuity to realize how deeply he had accepted the ways of the planet which had harbored his second life.\n \"I think you\u0027d better leave,\" she said.\n \"Not until you accept my withdrawal from Atreides service.\"\n \"Accepted!\" She bit it off. And only after she\u0027d uttered the word did she realize how much pure reflex had gone into this exchange. She needed time to think and reconsider. How had Idaho known what she would do? She did not believe him capable of leaping Time in the spice way.\n Idaho backed away from her until he felt the door behind him. He bowed. \"Once more I call you My Lady, and then never again. My advice to Farad\u0027n will be to send you back to Wallach, quietly and quickly, at the earliest practical moment. You are too dangerous a toy to keep around. Although I don\u0027t believe he thinks of you as a toy. You are working for the Sisterhood, not for the Atreides. I wonder now if you ever worked for the Atreides. You witches move too deeply and darkly for mere mortals ever to trust.\"\n \"A ghola considers himself a mere mortal,\" she jibed.\n \"Compared to you,\" he said.\n \"Leave!\" she ordered.\n \"Such is my intention.\" He slipped out the door, passing the curious stare of the servant who\u0027d obviously been listening.\n It\u0027s done, he thought. And they can read it in only one way.\n Only in the realm of mathematics can you understand Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s precise view of the future. Thus: first, we postulate any number of point-dimensions in space. (This is the classic n-fold extended aggregate of n dimensions.) With this framework, Time as commonly understood becomes an aggregate of one-dimensional properties. Applying this to the Muad\u0027Dib phenomenon, we find that we either are confronted by new properties of Time or (by reduction through the infinity calculus) we are dealing with separate systems which contain n body properties. For Muad\u0027Dib, we assume the latter. As demonstrated by the reduction, the point dimensions of the n-fold can only have separate existence within different frameworks of Time. Separate dimensions of Time are thus demonstrated to coexist. This being the inescapable case, Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s predictions required that he perceive the n-fold not as extended aggregate but as an operation within a single framework. In effect, he froze his universe into that one framework which was his view of Time. -Palimbasha: Lectures at Sietch Tabr\n Leto lay at the crest of a dune, peering across open sand at a sinuous rock outcropping.
