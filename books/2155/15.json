He ran with the sure knowledge that he and Ghanima could reach their narrow notch in time, but his gaze kept returning with fascination to the oncoming beasts.\\n\\n One stumble and we\u0027re lost, he thought.\\n\\n That thought reduced the sureness of his knowledge, and he ran faster.\\n\\n You Bene Gesserit call your activity of the Panoplia Prophetica a \"Science of Religion.\" Very well. I, a seeker after another kind of scientist, find this an appropriate definition. You do, indeed, build your own myths, but so do all societies. You I must warn, however. You are behaving as so many other misguided scientists have behaved. Your actions reveal that you wish to take something out of [away from] life. It is time you were reminded of that which you so often profess: One cannot have a single thing without its opposite. -The Preacher at Arrakeen: A Message to the Sisterhood\\n\\n In the hour before dawn, Jessica sat immobile on a worn rug of spice-cloth. Around her were the bare rocks of an old and poor sietch, one of the original settlements. It lay below the rim of Red Chasm, sheltered from the westerlies of the desert. Al-Fali and his brothers had brought her here; now they awaited word from Stilgar. The Fedaykin had moved cautiously in the matter of communication, however. Stilgar was not to know their location.\\n\\n The Fedaykin already knew they were under a proces-verbal, an official report of crimes against the Imperium. Alia was taking the tack that her mother had been suborned by enemies of the realm, although the Sisterhood had not yet been named. The high-handed, tyrannical nature of Alia\u0027s power was out in the open, however, and her belief that because she controlled the Priesthood she controlled the Fremen was about to be tested.\\n\\n Jessica\u0027s message to Stilgar had been direct and simple: \"My daughter is possessed and must be put to the trial.\"\\n\\n Fears destroyed values, though, and it already was known that some Fremen would prefer not to believe this accusation. Their attempts to use the accusation as a passport had brought on two battles during the night, but the ornithopters al-Fali\u0027s people had stolen had brought the fugitives to this precarious safety: Red Chasm Sietch. Word was going out to the Fedaykin from here, but fewer than two hundred of them remained on Arrakis. The others held posts throughout the Empire.\\n\\n Reflecting upon these facts, Jessica wondered if she had come to the place of her death. Some of the Fedaykin believed it, but the death commandos accepted this easily enough. Al-Fali had merely grinned at her when some of his young men voiced their fears.\\n\\n \"When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place. He causeth that creature\u0027s wants to direct him to that place,\" the old Naib had said.\\n\\n The patched curtains at her doorway rustled; al-Fali entered. The old man\u0027s narrow, windburned face appeared drawn, his eyes feverish. Obviously he had not rested.\\n\\n \"Someone comes,\" he said.\\n\\n \"From Stilgar?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps.\" He lowered his eyes, glanced leftward in the manner of the old Fremen who brought bad news.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Jessica demanded.\\n\\n \"We have word from Tabr that your grandchildren are not there.\" He spoke without looking at her.\\n\\n \"Alia...\"\\n\\n \"She has ordered that the twins be given over to her custody, but Sietch Tabr reports that the children are not there. That is all we know.\"\\n\\n \"Stilgar\u0027s sent them into the desert,\" Jessica said.\\n\\n \"Possibly, but it is known that he was searching for them all through the night. Perhaps it was a trick on his part...\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not Stilgar\u0027s way,\" she said, and thought: Unless the twins put him up to it. But that didn\u0027t feel right either. She wondered at herself: no sensations of panic to suppress, and her fears for the twins were tempered by what Ghanima had revealed. She peered up at al-Fali, found him studying her with pity in his eyes. She said: \"They\u0027ve gone into the desert by themselves.\"\\n\\n \"Alone? Those two children!\"\\n\\n She did not bother to explain that \"those two children\" probably knew more about desert survival than most living Fremen. Her thoughts were fixed, instead, on Leto\u0027s odd behavior when he\u0027d insisted that she allow herself to be abducted. She\u0027d put the memory aside, but this moment demanded it. He\u0027d said she would know the moment to obey him.\\n\\n \"The messenger should be in the sietch by now,\" al-Fali said. \"I will bring him to you.\" He let himself out through the patched curtain.\\n\\n Jessica stared at the curtain. It was red cloth of spice-fiber, but the patches were blue. The story was that this sietch had refused to profit from Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s religion, earning the enmity of Alia\u0027s Priesthood. The people here reportedly had put their capital into a scheme to raise dogs as large as ponies, dogs bred for intelligence as guardians of children. The dogs had all died. Some said it was poison and the Priests were blamed.\\n\\n She shook her head to drive out these reflections, recognizing them for what they were: ghafla, the gadfly distraction.\\n\\n Where had those children gone? To Jacurutu? They had a plan. They tried to enlighten me to the extent they thought I\u0027d accept, she remembered. And when they\u0027d reached the limits as they saw them, Leto had commanded her to obey.\\n\\n He\u0027d commanded her!\\n\\n Leto had recognized what Alia was doing; that much was obvious. Both twins had spoken of their aunt\u0027s \"affliction,\" even when defending her. Alia was gambling on the rightness of her position in the Regency. Demanding custody of the twins confirmed that. Jessica found a harsh laugh shaking her own breast. The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam had been fond of explaining this particular error to her student, Jessica. \"If you focus your awareness only upon your own rightness, then you invite the forces of opposition to overwhelm you. This is a common error. Even I, your teacher, have made it.\"\\n\\n \"And even I, your student, have made it,\" Jessica whispered to herself.\\n\\n She heard fabrics whispering in the passage beyond the curtain. Two young Fremen entered, part of the entourage they\u0027d picked up during the night. The two were obviously awed at being in the presence of Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s mother. Jessica had read them completely: they were non-thinkers, attaching themselves to any fancied power for the identity which this gave them. Without a reflection from her they were empty. Thus, they were dangerous.\\n\\n \"We were sent ahead by al-Fali to prepare you,\" one of the young Fremen said.\\n\\n Jessica felt an abrupt clenching tightness in her breast, but her voice remained calm. \"Prepare me for what?\"\\n\\n \"Stilgar has sent Duncan Idaho as his messenger.\"\\n\\n Jessica pulled her aba hood up over her hair, an unconscious gesture. Duncan? But he was Alia\u0027s tool.\\n\\n The Fremen who\u0027d spoken took a half step forward. \"Idaho says he has come to take you to safety, but al-Fali does not see how this can be.\"\\n\\n \"It seems passing strange, indeed,\" Jessica said. \"But there are stranger things in our universe. Bring him.\"\\n\\n They glanced at each other but obeyed, leaving together with such a rush that they tore another rent in the worn curtain.\\n\\n Presently Idaho stepped through the curtain, followed by the two Fremen and al-Fali bringing up the rear, hand on his crysknife. Idaho appeared composed. He wore the dress casuals of an Atreides House Guard, a uniform which had changed little in more than fourteen centuries. Arrakis had replaced the old gold-handled plasteel blade with a crysknife, but that was minor.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m told you wish to help me,\" Jessica said.\\n\\n \"As odd as that may seem,\" he said.\\n\\n \"But didn\u0027t Alia send you to abduct me?\" she asked.\\n\\n A slight raising of his black eyebrows was the only mark of surprise. The many-faceted Tleilaxu eyes continued to stare at her with glittering intensity. \"Those were her orders,\" he said.\\n\\n Al-Fali\u0027s knuckles went white on his crysknife, but he did not draw.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve spent much of this night reviewing the mistakes I made with my daughter,\" she said.\\n\\n \"There were many,\" Idaho agreed, \"and I shared in most of them.\"\\n\\n She saw now that his jaw muscles were trembling.\\n\\n \"It was easy to listen to the arguments which led us astray,\" Jessica said. \"I wanted to leave this place... You... you wanted a girl you saw as a younger version of me.\"\\n\\n He accepted this silently.\\n\\n \"Where are my grandchildren?\" she demanded, voice going harsh.\\n\\n He blinked. Then: \"Stilgar believes they have gone into the desert - hiding. Perhaps they saw this crisis coming.\"\\n\\n Jessica glanced at al-Fali, who nodded his recognition that she had anticipated this.\\n\\n \"What is Alia doing?\" Jessica asked.\\n\\n \"She risks civil war,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Do you believe it\u0027ll come to that?\"\\n\\n Idaho shrugged. \"Probably not. These are softer times. There are more people willing to listen to pleasant arguments.\"\\n\\n \"I agree,\" she said. \"Well and good, what of my grandchildren?\"\\n\\n \"Stilgar will find them - if...\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I see.\" It was really up to Gurney Halleck then. She turned to look at the rock wall on her left. \"Alia grasps the power firmly now.\" She looked back at Idaho. \"You understand? One uses power by grasping it lightly. To grasp too strongly is to be taken over by power, and thus to become its victim.\"\\n\\n \"As my Duke always told me,\" Idaho said.\\n\\n Somehow Jessica knew he meant the older Leto, not Paul. She asked: \"Where am I to be taken in this... abduction?\"\\n\\n Idaho peered down at her as though trying to see into the shadows created by the hood.\\n\\n Al-Fali stepped forward: \"My Lady, you are not seriously thinking...\"\\n\\n \"Is it not my right to decide my own fate?\" Jessica asked.\\n\\n \"But this...\" Al-Fali\u0027s head nodded toward Idaho.\\n\\n \"This was my loyal guardian before Alia was born,\" Jessica said. \"Before he died saving my son\u0027s life and mine. We Atreides always honor certain obligations.\"\\n\\n \"Then you will go with me?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n \"Where would you take her?\" al-Fali asked.\\n\\n \"Best that you don\u0027t know,\" Jessica said.\\n\\n Al-Fali scowled but remained silent. His face betrayed indecision, an understanding of the wisdom in her words but an unresolved doubt of Idaho\u0027s trustworthiness.\\n\\n \"What of the Fedaykin who helped me?\" Jessica asked.\\n\\n \"They have Stilgar\u0027s countenance if they can get to Tabr,\" Idaho said. Jessica faced al-Fali: \"I command you to go there, my friend. Stilgar can use Fedaykin in the search for my grandchildren.\"\\n\\n The old Naib lowered his gaze. \"As Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s mother commands.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s still obeying Paul, she thought.\\n\\n \"We should be out of here quickly,\" Idaho said. \"The search is certain to include this place, and that early.\"\\n\\n Jessica rocked forward and arose with that fluid grace which never quite left the Bene Gesserit, even when they felt the pangs of age. And she felt old now after her night of flight. Even as she moved, her mind remained on that peculiar interview with her grandson. What was he really doing? She shook her head, covered the motion by adjusting her hood. It was too easy to fall into the trap of underestimating Leto. Life with ordinary children conditioned one to a false view of the inheritance which the twins enjoyed.\\n\\n Her attention was caught by Idaho\u0027s pose. He stood in the relaxed preparedness for violence, one foot ahead of the other, a stance which she herself had taught him. She shot a quick look at the two young Fremen, at al-Fali. Doubts still assailed the old Fremen Naib and the two young men felt this.\\n\\n \"I trust this man with my life,\" she said, addressing herself to al-Fali. \"And it is not the first time.\"\\n\\n \"My Lady,\" al-Fali protested. \"It\u0027s just...\" He glared at Idaho. \"He\u0027s the husband of the Coan-Teen!\"\\n\\n \"And he was trained by my Duke and by me,\" she said.\\n\\n \"But he\u0027s a ghola!\" The words were torn from al-Fali.\\n\\n \"My son\u0027s ghola,\" she reminded him.\\n\\n It was too much for a former Fedaykin who\u0027d once pledged himself to support Muad\u0027Dib to the death. He sighed, stepped aside, and motioned the two young men to open the curtains.\\n\\n Jessica stepped through, Idaho behind her. She turned, spoke to al-Fali in the doorway. \"You are to go to Stilgar. He\u0027s to be trusted.\"\\n\\n \"Yes...\" But she still heard doubts in the old man\u0027s voice.\\n\\n Idaho touched her arm. \"We should go at once. Is there anything you wish to take?\"\\n\\n \"Only my common sense,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Why? Do you fear you\u0027re making a mistake?\"\\n\\n She glanced up at him. \"You were always the best \u0027thopter pilot in our service, Duncan.\"\\n\\n This did not amuse him. He stepped ahead of her, moving swiftly, retracing the way he\u0027d come. Al-Fali fell into step beside Jessica. \"How did you know he came by \u0027thopter?\"\\n\\n \"He wears no stillsuit,\" Jessica said.\\n\\n Al-Fali appeared abashed by this obvious perception. He would not be silenced, though. \"Our messenger brought him here directly from Stilgar\u0027s. They could\u0027ve been seen.\"\\n\\n \"Were you seen, Duncan?\" Jessica asked Idaho\u0027s back.\\n\\n \"You know better than that,\" he said. \"We flew lower than the dune tops.\"\\n\\n They turned into a side passage which led downward in spiral steps, debouching finally into an open chamber well-lighted by glowglobes high in the brown rock. A single ornithopter sat facing the far wall, crouched there like an insect waiting to spring. The wall would be false rock, then - a door opening onto the desert. As poor as this sietch was, it still maintained the instruments of secrecy and mobility.\\n\\n Idaho opened the ornithopter\u0027s door for her, helped her into the right-hand seat. As she moved past him, she saw perspiration on his forehead where a lock of the black goat-hair lay tumbled. Unbidden, Jessica found herself recalling that head spouting blood in a noisy cavern. The steely marbles of the Tleilaxu eyes brought her out of that recollection. Nothing was as it seemed anymore. She busied herself fastening her seatbelt.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been along time since you\u0027ve flown me, Duncan,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Long and far time,\" he said. He was already checking the controls.\\n\\n Al-Fali and the two younger Fremen waited beside the controls to the false rock, prepared to open it.\\n\\n \"Do you think I harbor doubts about you?\" Jessica asked, speaking softly to Idaho.\\n\\n Idaho kept his attention on an engine instrument, ignited the impellers and watched a needle move. A smile touched his mouth, a quick and harsh gesture in his sharp features, gone as quickly as it had come.\\n\\n \"I am still Atreides,\" Jessica said. \"Alia is not.\"\\n\\n \"Have no fear,\" he grated. \"I still serve the Atreides.\"\\n\\n \"Alia is no longer Atreides,\" Jessica repeated.\\n\\n \"You needn\u0027t remind me!\" he snarled. \"Now shut up and let me fly this thing.\"\\n\\n The desperation in his voice was quite unexpected, out of keeping with the Idaho she\u0027d known. Putting down a renewed sense of fear, Jessica asked: \"Where are we going, Duncan? You can tell me now.\"\\n\\n But he nodded to al-Fali and the false rock opened outward into bright silvery sunlight. The ornithopter leaped outward and up, its wings throbbing with the effort, the jets roaring, and they mounted into an empty sky. Idaho set a southwesterly course toward Sahaya Ridge which could be seen as a dark line upon the sand.\\n\\n Presently he said: \"Do not think harshly of me, My Lady.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t thought harshly of you since that night you came into our Arrakeen great hall roaring drunk on spice-beer,\" she said. But his words renewed her doubts, and she fell into the relaxed preparedness of complete prana-bindu defense.\\n\\n \"I remember that night well,\" he said. \"I was very young... inexperienced.\"\\n\\n \"But the best swordmaster in my Duke\u0027s retinue.\"\\n\\n \"Not quite, My Lady. Gurney could best me six times out of ten.\" He glanced at her. \"Where is Gurney?\"\\n\\n \"Doing my bidding.\"\\n\\n He shook his head.\\n\\n \"Do you know where we\u0027re going?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Yes, My Lady.\"\\n\\n \"Then tell me.\"\\n\\n \"Very well. I promised that I would create a believable plot against House Atreides. Only one way, really, to do that.\" He pressed a button on the control wheel and cocoon restraints whipped from Jessica\u0027s seat, enfolded her in unbreakable softness, leaving only her head exposed. \"I\u0027m taking you to Salusa Secundus,\" he said. \"To Farad\u0027n.\"\\n\\n In a rare, uncontrolled spasm, Jessica surged against the restraints, felt them tighten, easing only when she relaxed, but not before she felt the deadly shigawire concealed in the protective sheathing.\\n\\n \"The shigawire release has been disconnected,\" he said, not looking at her. \"Oh yes, and don\u0027t try Voice on me. I\u0027ve come a long way since the days when you could move me that way.\" He looked at her. \"The Tleilaxu armored me against such wiles.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re obeying Alia,\" Jessica said, \"and she -\"\\n\\n \"Not Alia,\" he said. \"We do The Preacher\u0027s bidding. He wants you to teach Farad\u0027n as once you taught... Paul.\"\\n\\n Jessica remained in frozen silence, remembering Leto\u0027s words, that she would find an interesting student. Presently she said: \"This Preacher - is he my son?\"\\n\\n Idaho\u0027s voice seemed to come from a great distance: \"I wish I knew.\"\\n\\n The universe is just there; that\u0027s the only way a Fedaykin can view it and remain the master of his senses. The universe neither threatens nor promises. It holds things beyond our sway: the fall of a meteor, the eruption of a spiceblow, growing old and dying. These are the realities of this universe and they must be faced regardless of how you feel about them. You cannot fend off such realities with words. They will come at you in their own wordless way and then, then you will understand what is meant by \"life and death.\" Understanding this, you will be filled with joy. -Muad\u0027Dib to his Fedaykin\\n\\n \"And those are the things we have set in motion,\" Wensicia said. \"These things were done for you.\"\\n\\n Farad\u0027n remained motionless, seated across from his mother in her morning room. The sun\u0027s golden light came from behind him, casting his shadow on the white-carpeted floor. Light reflected from the wall behind his mother drew a nimbus around her hair. She wore her usual white robe trimmed in gold - reminders of royal days. Her heart-shaped face appeared composed, but he knew she was watching his every reaction. His stomach felt empty, although he\u0027d just come from breakfast.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t approve?\" Wensicia asked.\\n\\n \"What is there to disapprove?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Well... that we kept this from you until now?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that.\" He studied his mother, tried to reflect upon his complex position in this matter. He could only think on a thing he had noticed recently, that Tyekanik no longer called her \"My Princess.\" What did he call her? Queen Mother?\\n\\n Why do I feel a sense of loss? he wondered. What am I losing? The answer was obvious: he was losing his carefree days, time for those pursuits of the mind which so attracted him. If this plot unfolded by his mother came off, those things would be gone forever. New responsibilities would demand his attention. He found that he resented this deeply. How dared they take such liberties with his time? And without even consulting him!\\n\\n \"Out with it,\" his mother said. \"Something\u0027s wrong.\"\\n\\n \"What if this plan fails?\" he asked, saying the first thing that came into his mind.\\n\\n \"How can it fail?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know... Any plan can fail. How\u0027re you using Idaho in all of this?\"\\n\\n \"Idaho? What\u0027s this interest in... Oh, yes - that mystic fellow Tyek brought here without consulting me. That was wrong of him. The mystic spoke of Idaho, didn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n It was a clumsy lie on her part, and Farad\u0027n found himself staring at his mother in wonderment. She\u0027d known about The Preacher all along!\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve never seen a ghola,\" he said.\\n\\n She accepted this, said: \"We\u0027re saving Idaho for something important.\"\\n\\n Farad\u0027n chewed silently at his upper lip.\\n\\n Wensicia found herself reminded of his dead father. Dalak had been like that at times, very inward and complex, difficult to read. Dalak, she reminded herself, had been related to Count Hasimir Fenring, and there\u0027d been something of the dandy and the fanatic in both of them. Would Farad\u0027n follow in that path? She began to regret having Tyek lead the lad into the Arrakeen religion. Who knew where that might take him?\\n\\n \"What does Tyek call you now?\" Farad\u0027n asked.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" She was startled by this shift.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve noticed that he doesn\u0027t call you \u0027My Princess\u0027 anymore.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-15.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) \\n The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
