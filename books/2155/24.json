{"id":97168,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Natural selection has been described as an environment selectively screening for those who will have progeny. Where humans are concerned, though, this is an extremely limiting viewpoint. Reproduction by sex tends toward experiment and innovation. It raises many questions, including the ancient one about whether environment is a selective agent after the variation occurs, or whether environment plays a pre-selective role in determining the variations which it screens. Dune did not realty answer those questions: it merely raised new questions which Leto and the Sisterhood may attempt to answer over the next five hundred generations. -The Dune Catastrophe, After Harq al-Ada The bare brown rocks of the Shield Wall loomed in the distance, visible to Ghanima as the embodiment of that apparition which threatened her future. She stood at the edge of the roof garden atop the Keep, the setting sun at her back. The sun held a deep orange glow from intervening dust clouds, a color as rich as the rim of a worm\u0027s mouth. She sighed, thinking: Alia... Alia... Is your fate to be my fate? The inner lives had grown increasingly clamorous of late. There was something about female conditioning in a Fremen society - perhaps it was a real sexual difference, but whatever - the female was more susceptible to that inner tide. Her grandmother had warned about it as they\u0027d schemed, drawing on the accumulated wisdom of the Bene Gesserit but awakening that wisdom\u0027s threats within Ghanima. \"Abomination;\" the Lady Jessica had said, \"our term for the pre-born, has a long history of bitter experiences behind it. The way of it seems to be that the inner lives divide. They split into the benign and the malignant. The benign remain tractable, useful. The malignant appear to unite in one powerful psyche, trying to take over the living flesh and its consciousness. The process is known to take considerable time, but its signs are well known.\" \"Why did you abandon Alia?\" Ghanima asked. \"I fled in terror of what I\u0027d created,\" Jessica said, her voice low. \"I gave up. And my burden now is that... perhaps I gave up too soon.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I cannot explain yet, but... maybe... no! I\u0027ll not give you false hopes. Ghafla, the abominable distraction, has a long history in human mythology. It was called many things, but chiefly it was called possession. That\u0027s what it seems to be. You lose your way in the malignancy and it takes possession of you.\" \"Leto... feared the spice,\" Ghanima said, finding that she could talk about him quietly. The terrible price demanded of them! \"And wisely,\" Jessica had said. She would say no more. But Ghanima had risked an explosion of her inner memories, peering past an odd blurred veil and futilely expanding on the Bene Gesserit fears. To explain what had befallen Alia did not ease it one bit. The Bene Gesserit accumulation of experience had pointed to a possible way out of the trap, though, and when Ghanima ventured the inner sharing, she first called upon the Mohalata, a partnership of the benign which might protect her. She recalled that sharing as she stood in the sunset glow at the edge of the Keep\u0027s roof garden. Immediately she felt the memory-presence of her mother. Chani stood there, an apparition between Ghanima and the distant cliffs. \"Enter here and you will eat the fruit of the Zaqquum, the food of hell!\" Chani said. \"Bar this door, my daughter; it is your only safety.\" The inner clamor lifted itself around the vision and Ghanima fled, sinking her consciousness into the Sisterhood\u0027s Credo, reacting out of desperation more than trust. Quickly she recited the Credo, moving her lips, letting her voice rise to a whisper: \"Religion is the emulation of the adult by the child. Religion is the encystment of past beliefs: mythology, which is guesswork, the hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, those pronouncements which men have made in search of personal power, all of it mingled with shreds of enlightenment. And always the ultimate unspoken commandment is \u0027Thou shall not question!\u0027 But we question. We break that commandment as a matter of course. The work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination, the harnessing of imagination to humankind\u0027s deepest sense of creativity.\" Slowly a sense of order returned to Ghanima\u0027s thoughts. She felt her body trembling, though, and knew how fragile was this peace she had attained - and that blurring veil remained in her mind. \"Leb Kamai,\" she whispered. \"Heart of my enemy, you shall not be my heart.\" And she called up a memory of Farad\u0027n\u0027s features, the saturnine young face with its heavy brows and firm mouth. Hate will make me strong, she thought. In hate, I can resist Alia\u0027s fate. But the trembling fragility of her position remained, and all she could think about was how much Farad\u0027n resembled his uncle, the late Shaddam IV. \"Here you are!\" It was Irulan coming up from Ghanima\u0027s right, striding along the parapet with movements reminiscent of a man. Turning, Ghanima thought: And she\u0027s Shaddam\u0027s daughter. \"Why will you persist in sneaking out alone?\" Irulan demanded, stopping in front of Ghanima and towering over her with a scowling face. Ghanima refrained from saying that she was not alone, that guards had seen her emerge onto the roof. Irulan\u0027s anger went to the fact that they were in the open here and that a distant weapon might find them. \"You\u0027re not wearing a stillsuit,\" Ghanima said. \"Did you know that in the old days someone caught outside the sietch without a stillsuit was automatically killed. To waste water was to endanger the tribe.\" \"Water! Water!\" Irulan snapped. \"I want to know why you endanger yourself this way. Come back inside. You make trouble for all of us.\" \"What danger is there now?\" Ghanima asked. \"Stilgar has purged the traitors. Alia\u0027s guards are everywhere.\" Irulan peered upward at the darkening sky. Stars were already visible against a grey-blue backdrop. She returned her attention to Ghanima. \"I won\u0027t argue. I was sent to tell you we have word from Farad\u0027n. He accepts, but for some reason he wishes to delay the ceremony.\" \"How long?\" \"We don\u0027t know yet. It\u0027s being negotiated. But Duncan is being sent home.\" \"And my grandmother?\" \"She chooses to stay on Salusa for the time being.\" \"Who can blame her?\" Ghanima asked. \"That silly fight with Alia!\" \"Don\u0027t try to gull me, Irulan! That was no silly fight. I\u0027ve heard the stories.\" \"The Sisterhood\u0027s fears -\" \"Are real,\" Ghanima said. \"Well, you\u0027ve delivered your message. Will you use this opportunity to have another try at dissuading me?\" \"I\u0027ve given up.\" \"You should know better than to try lying to me,\" Ghanima said. \"Very well! I\u0027ll keep trying to dissuade you. This course is madness.\" And Irulan wondered why she let Ghanima become so irritating. A Bene Gesserit didn\u0027t need to be irritated at anything. She said: \"I\u0027m concerned by the extreme danger to you. You know that. Ghani, Ghani... you\u0027re Paul\u0027s daughter. How can you -\" \"Because I\u0027m his daughter,\" Ghanima said. \"We Atreides go back to Agamemnon and we know what\u0027s in our blood. Never forget that, childless wife of my father. We Atreides have a bloody history and we\u0027re not through with the blood.\" Distracted, Irulan asked: \"Who\u0027s Agamemnon?\" \"How sparse your vaunted Bene Gesserit education proves itself,\" Ghanima said. \"I keep forgetting that you foreshorten history. But my memories go back to...\" She broke off; best not to arouse those shades from their fragile sleep. \"Whatever you remember,\" Irulan said, \"you must know how dangerous this course is to -\" \"I\u0027ll kill him,\" Ghanima said. \"He owes me a life.\" \"And I\u0027ll prevent it if I can.\" \"We already know this. You won\u0027t get the opportunity. Alia is sending you south to one of the new towns until after it\u0027s done.\" Irulan shook her head in dismay. \"Ghani, I took my oath that I\u0027d guard you against any danger. I\u0027ll do it with my own life if necessary. If you think I\u0027m going to languish in some brickwalled djedida while you...\" \"There\u0027s always the Huanui,\" Ghanima said, speaking softly. \"We have the deathstill as an alternative. I\u0027m sure you couldn\u0027t interfere from there.\" Irulan paled, put a hand to her mouth, forgetting for a moment all of her training. It was a measure of how much care she had invested in Ghanima, this almost complete abandonment of everything except animal fear. She spoke out of that shattering emotion, allowing it to tremble on her lips. \"Ghani, I don\u0027t fear for myself. I\u0027d throw myself into the worm\u0027s mouth for you. Yes, I\u0027m what you call me, the childless wife of your father, but you\u0027re the child I never had. I beg you...\" Tears glistened at the corners of her eyes. Ghanima fought down a tightness in her throat, said: \"There is another difference between us. You were never Fremen. I\u0027m nothing else. This is a chasm which divides us. Alia knows. Whatever else she may be, she knows this.\" \"You can\u0027t tell what Alia knows,\" Irulan said, speaking bitterly. \"If I didn\u0027t know her for Atreides, I\u0027d swear she has set herself to destroy her own Family.\" And how do you know she\u0027s still Atreides? Ghanima thought, wondering at this blindness in Irulan. This was a Bene Gesserit, and who knew better than they the history of Abomination? She would not let herself even think about it, let alone believe it. Alia must have worked some witchery on this poor woman. Ghanima said: \"I owe you a water debt. For that, I\u0027ll guard your life. But your cousin\u0027s forfeit. Say no more of that.\" Irulan stilled the trembling of her lips, wiped her eyes. \"I did love your father,\" she whispered. \"I didn\u0027t even know it until he was dead.\" \"Perhaps he isn\u0027t dead,\" Ghanima said. \"This Preacher...\" \"Ghani! Sometimes I don\u0027t understand you. Would Paul attack his own family?\" Ghanima shrugged, looked out at the darkening sky. \"He might find amusement in such a -\" \"How can you speak so lightly of this -\" \"To keep away the dark depths,\" Ghanima said. \"I don\u0027t taunt you. The gods know I don\u0027t. But I\u0027m just my father\u0027s daughter. I\u0027m every person who\u0027s contributed seed to the Atreides. You won\u0027t think of Abomination, but I can\u0027t think of anything else. I\u0027m the pre-born. I know what\u0027s within me.\" \"That foolish old superstition about -\" \"Don\u0027t!\" Ghanima reached a hand toward Irulan\u0027s mouth. \"I\u0027m every Bene Gesserit of their damnable breeding program up to and including my grandmother. And I\u0027m very much more.\" She tore at her left palm, drawing blood with a fingernail. \"This is a young body, but its experiences... Oh, gods. Irulan! My experiences! No!\" She put out her hand once more as Irulan moved closer. \"I know all of those futures which my father explored. I\u0027ve the wisdom of so many lifetimes, and all the ignorance, too... all the frailties. If you\u0027d help me, Irulan, first learn who I am.\" Instinctively Irulan bent and gathered Ghanima into her arms, holding her close, cheek against cheek. Don\u0027t let me have to kill this woman. Ghanima thought. Don\u0027t let that happen. As this thought swept through her, the whole desert passed into night. One small bird has called thee From a beak streaked crimson. It cried once over Sietch Tabr And thou went forth unto Funeral Plain. -Lament for Leto II Leto awoke to the tinkle of water rings in a woman\u0027s hair. He looked to the open doorway of his cell and saw Sabiha sitting there. In the half-immersed awareness of the spice he saw her outlined by all that his vision revealed about her. She was two years past the age when most Fremen women were wed or at least betrothed. Therefore her family was saving her for something... or someone. She was nubile... obviously. His vision-shrouded eyes saw her as a creature out of humankind\u0027s Terranic past: dark hair and pale skin, deep sockets which gave her blue-in-blue eyes a greenish cast. She possessed a small nose and a wide mouth above a sharp chin. And she was a living signal to him that the Bene Gesserit plan was known - or suspected - here in Jacurutu. So they hoped to revive Pharaonic Imperialism through him, did they? Then what was their design to force him into marrying his sister? Surely Sabiha could not prevent that. His captors knew the plan, though. And how had they learned it? They\u0027d not shared its vision. They\u0027d not gone with him where life became a moving membrane in other dimensions. The reflexive and circular subjectivity of the visions which revealed Sabiha were his and his alone. Again the water rings tinkled in Sabiha\u0027s hair and the sound stirred up his visions. He knew where he had been and what he had learned. Nothing could erase that. He was not riding a great Maker palanquin now, the tinkle of water rings among the passengers a rhythm for their passage songs. No... He was here in the cell of Jacurutu, embarked on that most dangerous of all journeys: away from and back to the Ahl as-sunna wal-jamas, from the real world of the senses and back to that world. What was she doing there with the water rings tinkling in her hair? Oh, yes. She was mixing more of the brew which they thought held him captive: food laced with spice essence to keep him half in and half out of the real universe until either he died or his grandmother\u0027s plan succeeded. And every time he thought he\u0027d won, they sent him back. The Lady Jessica was right, of course - that old witch! But what a thing to do. The total recall of all those lives within him was of no use at all until he could organize the data and remember it at will. Those lives had been the raw stuff of anarchy. One or all of them could have overwhelmed him. The spice and its peculiar setting here in Jacurutu had been a desperate gamble. Now Gurney waits for the sign and I refuse to give it to him. How long will his patience last? He stared out at Sabiha. She\u0027d thrown her hood back and revealed the tribal tattoos at her temples. Leto did not recognize the tattoos at first, then remembered where he was. Yes, Jacurutu still lived. Leto did not know whether to be thankful toward his grandmother or hate her. She wanted him to have conscious-level instincts. But instincts were only racial memories of how to handle crises. His direct memories of those other lives told him far more than that. He had it all organized now, and could see the peril of revealing himself to Gurney. No way of keeping the revelation from Namri. And Namri was another problem. Sabiha entered the cell with a bowl in her hands. He admired the way the light from outside made rainbow circles at the edges of her hair. Gently she raised his head and began feeding him from the bowl. It was only then he realized how weak he was. He allowed her to feed him while his mind went roving, recalling the session with Gurney and Namri. They believed him! Namri more than Gurney, but even Gurney could not deny what his senses had already reported to him about the planet. Sabiha wiped his mouth with a hem of her robe. Ahhh, Sabiha, he thought, recalling that other vision which filled his heart with pain. Many nights have I dreamed beside the open water, hearing the winds pass overhead. Many nights my flesh lay beside the snake\u0027s den and I dreamed of Sabiha in the summer heat. I saw her storing spice-bread baked on red-hot sheets of plasteel. I saw the clear water in the qanat, gentle and shining, but a storm wind ran through my heart. She sips coffee and eats. Her teeth shine in the shadows. I see her braiding my water rings into her hair. The amber fragrance of her bosom strikes through to my innermost senses. She torments me and oppresses me by her very existence. The pressure of his multi-memories exploded the time-frozen englobement which he had tried to resist. He felt twining bodies, the sounds of sex, rhythms laced in every sensory impression: lips, breathing, moist breaths, tongues. Somewhere in his vision there were helix shapes, coal-colored, and he felt the beat of those shapes as they turned within him. A voice pleaded in his skull: \"Please, please, please, please...\" There was an adult beefswelling in his loins and he felt his mouth open, holding, clinging to the girder-shape of ecstasy. Then a sigh, a lingering groundswelling sweetness, a collapse. Oh, how sweet to let that come into existence! \"Sabiha,\" he whispered. \"Oh, my Sabiha.\" When her charge had clearly gone deeply into the trance after his food, Sabiha took the bowl and left, pausing at the doorway to speak to Namri. \"He called my name again.\" \"Go back and stay with him,\" Namri said. \"I must find Halleck and discuss this with him.\" Sabiha deposited the bowl beside the doorway and returned to the cell. She sat on the edge of the cot, staring at Leto\u0027s shadowed face. Presently he opened his eyes and put a hand out, touching her cheek. He began to talk to her then, telling her about the vision in which she had lived. She covered his hand with her own as he spoke. How sweet he was... how very swee - She sank onto the cot, cushioned by his hand, unconscious before he pulled the hand away. Leto sat up, feeling the depths of his weakness. The spice and its visions had drained him. He searched through his cells for every spare spark of energy, climbed from the cot without disturbing Sabiha. He had to go, but he knew he\u0027d not get far. Slowly he sealed his stillsuit, drew the robe around him, slipped through the passage to the outer shaft. There were a few people about, busy at their own affairs. They knew him, but he was not their responsibility. Namri and Halleck would know what he was doing; Sabiha could not be far away. He found the kind of side passage he needed and walked boldly down it. Behind him Sabiha slept peacefully until Halleck roused her. She sat up, rubbed her eyes, saw the empty cot, saw her uncle standing behind Halleck, the anger on their faces. Namri answered the expression on her face: \"Yes, he\u0027s gone.\" \"How could you let him escape?\" Halleck raged. \"How is this possible?\" \"He was seen going toward the lower exit,\" Namri said, his voice oddly calm. Sabiha cowered in front of them, remembering. \"How?\" Halleck demanded. \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know.\" \"It\u0027s night and he\u0027s weak,\" Namri said. \"He won\u0027t get far.\" Halleck whirled on him. \"You want the boy to die!\" \"It wouldn\u0027t displease me.\" Again Halleck confronted Sabiha. \"Tell me what happened.\" \"He touched my cheek. He kept talking about his vision... us together.\" She looked down at the empty cot. \"He made me sleep. He put some magic on me.\" Halleck glanced at Namri. \"Could he be hiding inside somewhere?\" \"Nowhere inside. He\u0027d be found, seen. He was headed for the exit. He\u0027s out there.\" \"Magic,\" Sabiha muttered. \"No magic,\" Namri said. \"He hypnotized her. Almost did it to me, you remember? Said I was his friend.\" \"He\u0027s very weak,\" Halleck said. \"Only in his body,\" Namri said. \"He won\u0027t go far, though. I disabled the heel pumps of his stillsuit. He\u0027ll die with no water if we don\u0027t find him.\" Halleck almost turned and struck Namri, but held himself in rigid control. Jessica had warned him that Namri might have to kill the lad. Gods below! What a pass they\u0027d come to, Atreides against Atreides. He said: \"Is it possible he just wandered away in the spice trance?\" \"What difference does it make?\" Namri asked. \"If he escapes us he must die.\" \"We\u0027ll start searching at first light,\" Halleck said. \"Did he take a Fremkit?\" \"There\u0027re always a few beside the doorseal,\" Namri said. \"He\u0027d\u0027ve been a fool not to take one. Somehow he has never struck me as a fool.\" \"Then send a message to our friends,\" Halleck said. \"Tell them what\u0027s happened.\" \"No messages this night,\" Namri said. \"There\u0027s a storm coming. The tribes have been tracking it for three days now. It\u0027ll be here by midnight. Already communication\u0027s blanked out. The satellites signed off this sector two hours ago.\" A deep sigh shook Halleck. The boy would die out there for sure if the sandblast storm caught him. It would eat the flesh from his bones and sliver the bones to fragments. The contrived false death would become real. He slapped a fist into an open palm. The storm could trap them in the sietch. They couldn\u0027t even mount a search. And storm static had already isolated the sietch. \"Distrans,\" he said, thinking they might imprint a message onto a bat\u0027s voice and dispatch it with the alarm. Namri shook his head. \"Bats won\u0027t fly in a storm. Come on, man. They\u0027re more sensitive than we are. They\u0027ll cower in the cliffs until it\u0027s past. Best to wait for the satellites to pick us up again. Then we can try to find his remains.\" \"Not if he took a Fremkit and hid in the sand,\" Sabiha said. Cursing under his breath, Halleck whirled away from them, strode out into the sietch. Peace demands solutions, but we never reach living solutions; we only work toward them. A fixed solution is, by definition, a dead solution. The trouble with peace is that it tends to punish mistakes instead of rewarding brilliance. -The Words of My Father: an account of Muad\u0027Dib reconstructed by Harq al-Ada \"She\u0027s training him? She\u0027s training Farad\u0027n?\" Alia glared at Duncan Idaho with a deliberate mix of anger and incredulity. The Guild heighliner had swung into orbit around Arrakis at noon local. An hour later the lighter had put Idaho down at Arrakeen, unannounced, but all casual and open. Within minutes a \u0027thopter had deposited him atop the Keep. Warned of his impending arrival, Alia had greeted him there, coldly formal before her guards, but now they stood in her quarters beneath the north rim. He had just delivered his report, truthfully, precisely, emphasizing each datum in mentat fashion. \"She has taken leave of her senses,\" Alia said. He treated the statement as a mentat problem. \"All the indicators are that she remains well balanced, sane. I should say her sanity index was -\" \"Stop that!\" Alia snapped. \"What can she be thinking of?\" Idaho, who knew that his own emotional balance depended now upon retreat into mentat coldness, said: \"I compute she is thinking of her granddaughter\u0027s betrothal.\" His features remained carefully bland, a mask for the raging grief which threatened to engulf him. There was no Alia here. Alia was dead. For a time he\u0027d maintained a myth-Alia before his senses, someone he\u0027d manufactured out of his own needs, but a mentat could carry on such self-deception for only a limited time. This creature in human guise was possessed; a demon-psyche drove her. His steely eyes with their myriad facets available at will reproduced upon his vision centers a multiplicity of myth-Alias. But when he combined them into a single image, no Alia remained. Her features moved to other demands. She was a shell within which outrages had been committed. \"Where\u0027s Ghanima?\" he asked. She waved the question aside. \"I\u0027ve sent her with Irulan to stay in Stilgar\u0027s keeping.\" Neutral territory, he thought. There\u0027s been another negotiation with rebellious tribes. She\u0027s losing ground and doesn\u0027t know it... or does she? Is there another reason? Has Stilgar gone over to her? \"The betrothal,\" Alia mused. \"What are conditions in the Corrino House?\" \"Salusa swarms with outrine relatives, all working upon Farad\u0027n, hoping for a share in his return to power.\" \"And she\u0027s training him in the Bene Gesserit...\" \"Is it not fitting for Ghanima\u0027s husband?\" Alia smiled to herself, thinking of Ghanima\u0027s adamant rage. Let Farad\u0027n be trained. Jessica was training a corpse. It would all work out. \"I must consider this at length,\" she said. \"You\u0027re very quiet, Duncan.\" \"I await your questions.\" \"I see. You know, I was very angry with you. Taking her to Farad\u0027n!\" \"You commanded me to make it real.\" \"I was forced to put out the report that you\u0027d both been taken captive,\" she said. \"I obeyed your orders.\" \"You\u0027re so literal at times, Duncan. You almost frighten me. But if you hadn\u0027t, well...\" \"The Lady Jessica\u0027s out of harm\u0027s way,\" he said. \"And for Ghanima\u0027s sake we should be grateful that -\" \"Exceedingly grateful,\" she agreed. And she thought: He\u0027s no longer trustworthy. He has that damnable Atreides loyalty. I must make an excuse to send him away... and have him eliminated. An accident, of course. She touched his cheek. Idaho forced himself to respond to the caress, taking her hand and kissing it. \"Duncan, Duncan, how sad it is,\" she said. \"But I cannot keep you here with me. Too much is happening and I\u0027ve so few I can completely trust.\" He released her hand, waited. \"I was forced to send Ghanima to Tabr,\" she said. \"Things are in deep unrest here. Raiders from the Broken Lands breached the qanats at Kagga Basin and spilled all of their waters into the sands. Arrakeen was on short rations. The Basin\u0027s alive with sandtrout yet, reaping the water harvest. They\u0027re being dealt with, of course, but we\u0027re spread very thin.\" He\u0027d already noted how few amazons of Alia\u0027s guard were to be seen in the Keep. And he thought: The Maquis of the Inner Desert will keep on probing her defenses. Doesn\u0027t she know that?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-24.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
