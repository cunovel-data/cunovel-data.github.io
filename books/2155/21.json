{"id":97165,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"Again you recite without belief,\" Namri sneered. \"But I\u0027ll accept it for now because I think you know why you\u0027re here.\" A cold smile touched his lips. \"I give you a provisional future, Atreides.\"\n Leto studied the man warily. Was this another question in disguise?\n \"Good!\" Namri said. \"Your awareness has been prepared. I\u0027ve sunk home the barbs. One more thing, then. Have you heard that they use imitation stillsuits in the cities of far Kadrish?\"\n As Namri waited, Leto quested in his mind for a hidden meaning. Imitation stillsuits? They were worn on many planets. He said: \"The foppish habits of Kadrish are an old story often repeated. The wise animal blends into its surroundings.\"\n Namri nodded slowly. Then: \"The one who trapped you and brought you here will see you presently. Do not try to leave this place. It would be your death.\" Arising as he spoke, Namri went out into the dark passage.\n For a long time after he had gone, Leto stared into the passage. He could hear sounds out there, the quiet voices of men on guard duty. Namri\u0027s story of the mirage-vision stayed with Leto. It brought up the long desert crossing to this place. It no longer mattered whether this were Jacurutu/Fondak. Namri was not a smuggler. He was something much more potent. And the game Namri played smelled of the Lady Jessica; it stank of the Bene Gesserit. Leto sensed an enclosing peril in this realization. But that dark passage where Namri had gone was the only exit from this room. And outside lay a strange sietch - beyond that, the desert. The harsh severity of that desert, its ordered chaos with mirages and endless dunes, came over Leto as part of the trap in which he was caught. He could recross that sand, but where would flight take him? The thought was like stagnant water. It would not quench his thirst.\n Because of the one-pointed Time awareness in which the conventional mind remains immersed, humans tend to think of everything in a sequential, word-oriented framework. This mental trap produces very short-term concepts of effectiveness and consequences, a condition of constant, unplanned response to crises. -Liet-Kynes, The Arrakis Workbook\n Words and movements simultaneous, Jessica reminded herself and she bent her thoughts to those necessary mental preparations for the coming encounter.\n The hour was shortly after breakfast, the golden sun of Salusa Secundus just beginning to touch the far wall of the enclosed garden which she could see from her window. She had dressed herself carefully: the black hooded cloak of a Reverend Mother, but it carried the Atreides crest in gold worked into an embroidered ring around the hem and again at the cuff of each sleeve. Jessica arranged the drape of her garment carefully as she turned her back on the window, holding her left arm across her waist to present the Hawk motif of the crest.\n Farad\u0027n noted the Atreides symbols, commenting on them as he entered, but he betrayed no anger or surprise. She detected subtle humor in his voice and wondered at it. She saw that he had clad himself in the grey leotard which she had suggested. He sat on the low green divan to which she directed him, relaxing with his right arm along the back.\n Why do I trust her? he wondered. This is a Bene Gesserit witch!\n Jessica, reading the thought in the contrast between his relaxed body and the expression on his face, smiled and said: \"You trust me because you know our bargain is a good one, and you want what I can teach you.\"\n She saw the pinch of a scowl touch his brow, waved her left hand to calm him. \"No, I don\u0027t read minds. I read the face, the body, the mannerisms, tone of voice, set of arms. Anyone can do this once they learn the Bene Gesserit Way.\"\n \"And you will teach me?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve studied the reports about us,\" she said. \"Is there anywhere a report that we fail to deliver on a direct promise?\"\n \"No reports, but...\"\n \"We survive in part by the complete confidence which people can have in our truthfulness. That has not changed.\"\n \"I find this reasonable,\" he said. \"I\u0027m anxious to begin.\"\n \"I\u0027m surprised you\u0027ve never asked the Bene Gesserit for a teacher,\" she said. \"They would\u0027ve leaped at the opportunity to put you in their debt.\"\n \"My mother would never listen to me when I urged her to do this,\" he said. \"But now...\" He shrugged, an eloquent comment on Wensicia\u0027s banishment. \"Shall we start?\"\n \"It would\u0027ve been better to begin this when you were much younger,\" Jessica said. \"It\u0027ll be harder for you now, and it\u0027ll take much longer. You\u0027ll have to begin by learning patience, extreme patience. I pray you\u0027ll not find it too high a price.\"\n \"Not for the reward you offer.\"\n She heard the sincerity, the pressure of expectations, and the touch of awe in his voice. These formed a place to begin. She said: \"The art of patience, then - starting with some elementary prana-bindu exercises for the legs and arms, for your breathing. We\u0027ll leave the hands and fingers for later. Are you ready?\"\n She seated herself on a stool facing him.\n Farad\u0027n nodded, holding an expectant expression on his face to conceal the sudden onset of fear. Tyekanik had warned him that there must be a trick in the Lady Jessica\u0027s offer, something brewed by the Sisterhood. \"You cannot believe that she has abandoned them again or that they have abandoned her.\" Farad\u0027n had stopped the argument with an angry outburst for which he\u0027d been immediately sorry. His emotional reaction had made him agree more quickly with Tyekanik\u0027s precautions. Farad\u0027n glanced at the corners of the room, the subtle gleam of jems in the coving. All that glittered was not jems: everything in this room would be recorded and good minds would review every nuance, every word, every movement.\n Jessica smiled, noting the direction of his gaze, but not revealing that she knew where his attention had wandered. She said: \"To learn patience in the Bene Gesserit Way, you must begin by recognizing the essential, raw instability of our universe. We call nature - meaning this totality in all of its manifestations - the Ultimate Non-Absolute. To free your vision and permit you to recognize this conditional nature\u0027s changing ways, you will hold your two hands at arm\u0027s length in front of you. Stare at your extended hands, first the palms and then the backs. Examine the fingers, front and back. Do it.\"\n Farad\u0027n complied, but he felt foolish. These were his own hands. He knew them.\n \"Imagine your hands aging,\" Jessica said. \"They must grow very old in your eyes. Very, very old. Notice how dry the skin...\"\n \"My hands don\u0027t change,\" he said. He already could feel the muscles of his upper arms trembling.\n \"Continue to stare at your hands. Make them old, as old as you can imagine. It may take time. But when you see them age, reverse the process. Make your hands young again - as young as you can make them. Strive to take them from infancy to great age at will, back and forth, back and forth.\"\n \"They don\u0027t change!\" he protested. His shoulders ached.\n \"If you demand it of your senses, your hands will change,\" she said. \"Concentrate upon visualizing the flow of time which you desire: infancy to age, age to infancy. It may take you hours, days, months. But it can be achieved. Reversing that change-flow will teach you to see every system as something spinning in relative stability... only relative.\"\n \"I thought I was learning patience.\" She heard anger in his voice, an edge of frustration.\n \"And relative stability,\" she said. \"This is the perspective which you create with your own belief, and beliefs can be manipulated by imagination. You\u0027ve learned only a limited way of looking at the universe. Now you must make the universe your own creation. This will permit you to harness any relative stability to your own uses, to whatever uses you are capable of imagining.\"\n \"How long did you say it takes?\"\n \"Patience,\" she reminded him.\n A spontaneous grin touched his lips. His eyes wavered toward her.\n \"Look at your hands!\" she snapped.\n The grin vanished. His gaze jerked back to a fixated concentration upon his extended hands.\n \"What do I do when my arms get tired?\" he asked.\n \"Stop talking and concentrate,\" she said. \"If you become too tired, stop. Return to it after a few minutes of relaxation and exercise. You must persist in this until you succeed. At your present stage, this is more important than you could possibly realize. Learn this lesson or the others will not come.\"\n Farad\u0027n inhaled a deep breath, chewed his lips, stared at his hands. He turned them slowly: front, back, front, back... His shoulders trembled with fatigue. Front, back... Nothing changed.\n Jessica arose, crossed to the only door.\n He spoke without removing his attention from his hands. \"Where are you going?\"\n \"You\u0027ll work better on this if you\u0027re alone. I\u0027ll return in about an hour. Patience.\"\n \"I know!\"\n She studied him a moment. How intent he looked. He reminded her with a heart-tugging abruptness of her own lost son. She permitted herself a sigh, said: \"When I return I\u0027ll give you the exercise lessons to relieve your muscles. Give it time. You\u0027ll be astonished at what you can make your body and your senses do.\"\n She let herself out.\n The omnipresent guards took up station three paces behind her as she strode down the hall. Their awe and fear were obvious. They were Sardaukar, thrice-warned of her prowess, raised on the stories of their defeat by the Fremen of Arrakis. This witch was a Fremen Reverend Mother, a Bene Gesserit and an Atreides.\n Jessica, glancing back, saw their stern faces as a milepost in her design. She turned away as she came to the stairs, went down them and through a short passage into the garden below her windows.\n Now if only Duncan and Gurney can do their parts, she thought as she felt the gravel of a pathway beneath her feet, saw the golden light filtered by greenery.\n You will learn the integrated communication methods as you complete the next step in your mentat education. This is a gestalten function which will overlay data paths in your awareness, resolving complexities and masses of input from the mentat index-catalogue techniques which you already have mastered. Your initial problem will be the breaking tensions arising from the divergent assembly of minutiae/data on specialized subjects. Be warned. Without mentat overlay integration, you can be immersed in the Babel Problem, which is the label we give to the omnipresent dangers of achieving wrong combinations from accurate information. -The Mentat Handbook\n The sound of fabrics rubbing together sent sparks of awareness through Leto. He was surprised that he had turned his sensitivity to the point where he automatically identified the fabrics from their sound: the combination came from a Fremen robe rubbing against the coarse hangings of a door curtain. He turned toward the sound. It came from the passage where Namri had gone minutes before. As Leto turned, he saw his captor enter. It was the same man who had taken him prisoner: the same dark strip of skin above the stillsuit mask, the identical searing eyes. The man lifted a hand to his mask, slipped the catchtube from his nostrils, lowered the mask and, in the same motion, flipped his hood back. Even before he focused on the scar of the inkvine whip along the man\u0027s jaw, Leto recognized him. The recognition was a totality in his awareness with the search for confirming details coming afterward. No mistake about it, this rolling lump of humanity, this warrior-troubadour, was Gurney Halleck!\n Leto clenched his hands into fists, overcome momentarily by the shock of recognition. No Atreides retainer had ever been more loyal. None better at shield fighting. He\u0027d been Paul\u0027s trusted confidant and teacher.\n He was the Lady Jessica\u0027s servant.\n These recognitions and more surged through Leto\u0027s mind. Gurney was his captor. Gurney and Namri were in this conspiracy together. And Jessica\u0027s hand was in it with them.\n \"I understand you\u0027ve met our Namri,\" Halleck said. \"Pray believe him, young sir. He has one function and one function only. He\u0027s the one capable of killing you should the need arise.\"\n Leto responded automatically with his father\u0027s tones: \"So you\u0027ve joined my enemies, Gurney! I never thought the -\"\n \"Try none of your devil tricks on me, lad,\" Halleck said. \"I\u0027m proof against them all. I follow your grandmother\u0027s orders. Your education has been planned to the last detail. It was she who approved my selection of Namri. What comes next, painful as it may seem, is at her command.\"\n \"And what does she command?\"\n Halleck lifted a hand from the folds of his robe, exposed a Fremen injector, primitive but efficient. Its transparent tube was charged with blue fluid.\n Leto squirmed backward on the cot, was stopped by the rock wall. As he moved, Namri entered, stood beside Halleck with hand on crysknife. Together they blocked the only exit.\n \"I see you\u0027ve recognized the spice essence,\" Halleck said. \"You\u0027re to take the worm trip, lad. You must go through it. Otherwise, what your father dared and you dare not would hang over you for the rest of your days.\"\n Leto shook his head wordlessly. This was the thing he and Ghanima knew could overwhelm them. Gurney was an ignorant fool! How could Jessica... Leto felt the father-presence in his memories. It surged into his mind, trying to strip away his defenses. Leto wanted to shriek outrage, could not move his lips. But this was the wordless thing which his pre-born awareness most feared. This was prescient trance, the reading of immutable future with all of its fixity and its terrors. Surely Jessica could not have ordered such an ordeal for her own grandson. But her presence loomed in his mind, filling him with acceptance arguments. Even the litany of fear was pressed upon him with a repetitive droning: \"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past...\"\n With an oath already ancient when Chaldea was young, Leto tried to move, tried to leap at the two men standing over him, but his muscles refused to obey. As though he already existed in the trance, Leto saw Halleck\u0027s hand move, the injector approach. The light of a glowglobe sparkled within the blue fluid. The injector touched Leto\u0027s left arm. Pain lanced through him, shot upward to the muscles of his head.\n Abruptly Leto saw a young woman sitting outside a crude hut in dawnlight. She sat right there in front of him roasting coffee beans to a rose brown, adding cardamom and melange. The voice of a rebeck echoed from somewhere behind him. The music echoed and echoed until it entered his head, still echoing. It suffused his body and he felt himself to be large, very large, not a child at all. And his skin was not his own. He knew that sensation! His skin was not his own. Warmth spread through his body. As abruptly as his first vision, he found himself standing in darkness. It was night. Stars like a rain of embers fell in gusts from a brilliant cosmos.\n Part of him knew there was no escaping, but still he tried to fight it until the father-presence intruded. \"I will protect you in the trance. The others within will not take you.\"\n Wind tumbled Leto, rolled him, hissing, pouring dust and sand over him, cutting his arms, his face, abrading his clothes, whipping the loose-torn ends of now useless fabric. But he felt no pain and he saw the cuts heal as rapidly as they appeared. Still he rolled with the wind. And his skin was not his own.\n It will happen! he thought.\n But the thought was distant and came as though it were not his own, not really his own; no more than his skin.\n The vision absorbed him. It evolved into a stereologic memory which separated past and present, future and present, future and past. Each separation mingled into a trinocular focus which he sensed as the multidimensional relief map of his own future existence.\n He thought: Time is a measure of space, just as a range finder is a measure of space, but measuring locks us into the place we measure.\n He sensed the trance deepening. It came as an amplification of internal consciousness which his self-identity soaked up and through which he felt himself changing. It was living Time and he could not arrest an instant of it. Memory fragments, future and past, deluged him. But they existed as montage-in-motion. Their relationships underwent a constant dance. His memory was a lens, an illuminating searchlight which picked out fragments, isolating them, but forever failing to stop the ceaseless motion and modification which surged into his view.\n That which he and Ghanima had planned came through the searchlight, dominating everything, but now it terrified him. Vision reality ached in him. The uncritical inevitability made his ego cringe.\n And his skin was not his own! Past and present tumbled through him, surging across the barriers of his terror. He could not separate them. One moment he felt himself setting forth on the Butlerian Jihad, eager to destroy any machine which simulated human awareness. That had to be the past - over and done with. Yet his senses hurtled through the experience, absorbing the most minute details. He heard a minister-companion speaking from a pulpit: \"We must negate the machines-that-think. Humans must set their own guidelines. This is not something machines can do. Reasoning depends upon programming, not on hardware, and we are the ultimate program!\"\n He heard the voice clearly, knew his surroundings - a vast wooden hall with dark windows. Light came from sputtering flames. And his minister-companion said: \"Our Jihad is a \u0027dump program.\u0027 We dump the things which destroy us as humans!\"\n And it was in Leto\u0027s mind that the speaker had been a servant of computers, one who knew them and serviced them. But the scene vanished and Ghanima stood in front of him, saying: \"Gurney knows. He told me. They\u0027re Duncan\u0027s words and Duncan was speaking as a mentat. \u0027In doing good, avoid notoriety; in doing evil, avoid self-awareness.\u0027\n That had to be future - far future. But he felt the reality. It was as intense as any past from his multitude of lives. And he whispered: \"Isn\u0027t that true, father?\"\n But the father-presence within spoke warningly: \"Don\u0027t invite disaster! You\u0027re learning stroboscopic awareness now. Without it you could overrun yourself, lose your place-mark in Time.\"\n And the bas-relief imagery persisted. Intrusions hammered at him. Past-present-now. There was no true separation. He knew he had to flow with this thing, but the flowing terrified him. How could he return to any recognizable place? Yet he felt himself being forced to cease every effort of resistance. He could not grasp his new universe in motionless, labeled bits. No bit would stand still. Things could not be forever ordered and formulated. He had to find the rhythm of change and see between the changes to the changing itself. Without knowing where it began he found himself moving within a gigantic moment bienheureux, able to see the past in the future, present in past, the now in both past and future. It was the accumulation of centuries experienced between one heartbeat and the next.\n Leto\u0027s awareness floated free, no objective psyche to compensate for consciousness, no barriers. Namri\u0027s \"provisional future\" remained lightly in his memory, but it shared awareness with many futures. And in this shattering awareness, all of his past, every inner life became his own. With the help of the greatest within him, he dominated. They were his.\n He thought: When you study an object from a distance, only its principle may be seen. He had achieved the distance and he could see his own life now: the multi-past and its memories were his burden, his joy, and his necessity. But the worm trip had added another dimension and his father no longer stood guard within him because the need no longer existed. Leto saw through the distances clearly - past and present. And the past presented him with an ultimate ancestor - one who was called Harum and without whom the distant future would not be. These clear distances provided new principles, new dimensions of sharing. Whichever life he now chose, he\u0027d live it out in an autonomous sphere of mass experience, a trail of lives so convoluted that no single lifetime could count the generations of it. Aroused, this mass experience held the power to subdue his selfdom. It could make itself felt upon an individual, a nation, a society or an entire civilization. That, of course, was why Gurney had been taught to fear him; why Namri\u0027s knife waited. They could not be allowed to see this power within him. No one could ever see it in its fullness - not even Ghanima.\n Presently Leto sat up, saw that only Namri remained, watching.\n In an old voice, Leto said: \"There\u0027s no single set of limits for all men. Universal prescience is an empty myth. Only the most powerful local currents of Time may be foretold. But in an infinite universe, local can be so gigantic that your mind shrinks from it.\"\n Namri shook his head, not understanding.\n \"Where\u0027s Gurney?\" Leto asked.\n \"He left lest he have to watch me slay you.\"\n \"Will you slay me, Namri?\" It was almost a plea to have the man do it.\n Namri took his hand from his knife. \"Since you ask me to do it, I will not. If you were indifferent, though...\"\n \"The malady of indifference is what destroys many things,\" Leto said. He nodded to himself. \"Yes... even civilizations die of it. It\u0027s as though that were the price demanded for achieving new levels of complexity or consciousness.\" He looked up at Namri. \"So they told you to look for indifference in me?\" And he saw Namri was more than a killer - Namri was devious.\n \"As a sign of unbridled power,\" Namri said, but it was a lie.\n \"Indifferent power, yes.\" Leto sat up, sighed deeply. \"There was no moral grandeur to my father\u0027s life, Namri; only a local trap which he built for himself.\"\n O Paul, thou Muad\u0027Dib, Mahdi of all men, Thy breath exhaled Sent forth the hurricane. -Songs of Muad\u0027Dib\n \"Never!\" Ghanima said. \"I\u0027d kill him on our wedding night.\" She spoke with a barbed stubbornness which thus far had resisted all blandishments. Alia and her advisors had been at it half the night, keeping the royal quarters in a state of unrest, sending out for new advisors, for food and drink. The entire Temple and its adjoining Keep seethed with the frustrations of unmade decisions.\n Ghanima sat composedly on a green floater chair in her own quarters, a large room with rough tan walls to simulate sietch rock. The ceiling, however, was imbar crystal which flickered with blue light, and the floor was black tile. The furnishings were sparse: a small writing table, five floater chairs and a narrow cot set into an alcove, Fremen fashion. Ghanima wore a robe of yellow mourning.\n \"You are not a free person who can settle every aspect of her own life,\" Alia said for perhaps the hundredth time. The little fool must come to realize this sooner or later! She must approve the betrothal to Farad\u0027n. She must! Let her kill him later, but the betrothal requires open acknowledgment by the Fremen affianced.\n \"He killed my brother,\" Ghanima said, holding to the single note which sustained her. \"Everyone knows this. Fremen would spit at the mention of my name were I to consent to this betrothal.\"\n And that is one of the reasons why you must consent, Alia thought. She said: \"His mother did it. He has banished her for it. What more do you want of him?\"\n \"His blood,\" Ghanima said. \"He\u0027s a Corrino.\"\n \"He has denounced his own mother,\" Alia protested. \"And why should you worry about the Fremen rabble? They\u0027ll accept whatever we tell them to accept. Ghani, the peace of the Empire demands that -\"\n \"I will not consent,\" Ghanima said. \"You cannot announce the betrothal without me.\"\n Irulan, entering the room as Ghanima spoke, glanced inquiringly at Alia and the two female advisors who stood dejectedly beside her. Irulan saw Alia throw up her arms in disgust and drop into a chair facing Ghanima.\n \"You speak to her, Irulan,\" Alia said.\n Irulan pulled a floater into place, sat down beside Alia.\n \"You\u0027re a Corrino, Irulan,\" Ghanima said. \"Don\u0027t press your luck with me.\" Ghanima got up, crossed to her cot and sat on it cross-legged, glaring back at the women. Irulan, she saw, had dressed in a black aba to match Alia\u0027s, the hood thrown back to reveal her golden hair. It was mourning hair under the yellow glow of the floating globes which illumi \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-21.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) \n The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
