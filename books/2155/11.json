{"id":97155,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"Don\u0027t put such fickle interpretations into me,\" he said. Alia pursed her lips. Had she moved too rapidly? Duncan crossed to the chambered opening which looked down on a corner of the Temple plaza. He could see pilgrims beginning to gather there, the Arrakeen traders moving in to feed on the edges like a pack of predators upon a herd of beasts. He focused on a particular group of tradesmen, spice-fiber baskets over their arms, Fremen mercenaries a pace behind them. They moved with a stolid force through the gathering throng. \"They sell pieces of etched marble,\" he said, pointing. \"Did you know that? They set the pieces out in the desert to be etched by stormsands. Sometimes they find interesting patterns in the stone. They call it a new art form, very popular: genuine storm-etched marble from Dune. I bought a piece of it last week - a golden tree with five tassels, lovely but very fragile.\" \"Don\u0027t change the subject,\" Alia said. \"I haven\u0027t changed the subject,\" he said. \"It\u0027s beautiful, but it\u0027s not art. Humans create art by their own violence, by their own volition.\" He put his right hand on the windowsill. \"The twins detest this city and I\u0027m afraid I see their point.\" \"I fail to see the association,\" Alia said. \"The abduction of my mother is not a real abduction. She will be safe as your captive.\" \"This city was built by the blind,\" he said. \"Did you know that Leto and Stilgar went out from Sietch Tabr into the desert last week? They were gone the whole night.\" \"It was reported to me,\" she said. \"These baubles from the sand - would you have me prohibit their sale?\" \"That\u0027d be bad for business,\" he said, turning. \"Do you know what Stilgar said when I asked why they went out on the sand that way? He said Leto wished to commune with the spirit of Muad\u0027Dib.\" Alia felt the sudden coldness of panic, looked in the mirror a moment to recover. Leto would not venture from the sietch at night for such nonsense. Was it a conspiracy? Idaho put a hand over his eyes to blot out the sight of her, said: \"Stilgar told me he went along with Leto because he still believes in Muad\u0027Dib.\" \"Of course he does!\" Idaho chuckled, a hollow sound. \"He said he still believes because Muad\u0027Dib was always for the little people.\" \"What did you say to that?\" Alia asked, her voice betraying her fear. Idaho dropped his hand from his eyes. \"I said, \u0027That must make you one of the little people.\u0027 \" \"Duncan! That\u0027s a dangerous game. Bait that Fremen Naib and you could awaken a beast to destroy us all.\" \"He still believes in Muad\u0027Dib,\" Idaho said. \"That\u0027s our protection.\" \"What was his reply?\" \"He said he knew his own mind.\" \"I see.\" \"No... I don\u0027t believe you do. Things that bite have longer teeth than Stilgar\u0027s.\" \"I don\u0027t understand you today, Duncan. I ask you to do a very important thing, a thing vital to... What is all of this rambling?\" How petulant she sounded. He turned back to the chambered window. \"When I was trained as a mentat... It is very difficult, Alia, to learn how to work your own mind. You learn first that the mind must be allowed to work itself. That\u0027s very strange. You can work your own muscles, exercise them, strengthen them, but the mind acts of itself. Sometimes, when you have learned this about the mind, it shows you things you do not want to see.\" \"And that\u0027s why you tried to insult Stilgar?\" \"Stilgar doesn\u0027t know his own mind; he doesn\u0027t let it run free.\" \"Except in the spice orgy.\" \"Not even there. That\u0027s what makes him a Naib. To be a leader of men, he controls and limits his reactions. He does what is expected of him. Once you know this, you know Stilgar and you can measure the length of his teeth.\" \"That\u0027s the Fremen way,\" she said. \"Well, Duncan, will you do it, or won\u0027t you? She must be taken and it must be made to look like the work of House Corrino.\" He remained silent, weighing her tone and arguments in his mentat way. This abduction plan spoke of a coldness and a cruelty whose dimensions, thus revealed, shocked him. Risk her own mother\u0027s life for the reasons thus far produced? Alia was lying. Perhaps the whisperings about Alia and Javid were true. This thought produced an icy hardness in his stomach. \"You\u0027re the only one I can trust for this,\" Alia said. \"I know that,\" he said. She took this as acceptance, smiled at herself in the mirror. \"You know,\" Idaho said, \"the mentat learns to look at every human as a series of relationships.\" Alia did not respond. She sat, caught in a personal memory which drew a blank expression on her face. Idaho, glancing over his shoulder at her, saw the expression and shuddered. It was as though she communed with voices heard only by herself. \"Relationships,\" he whispered. And he thought: One must cast off old agonies as a snake casts off its skin - only to grow a new set and accept all of their limitations. It was the same with governments - even the Regency. Old governments can be traced like discarded molts. I must carry out this scheme, but not in the way Alia commands. Presently Alia shook her shoulders, said: \"Leto should not be going out like that in these times. I will reprimand him.\" \"Not even with Stilgar?\" \"Not even with him.\" She arose from her mirror, crossed to where Idaho stood beside the window, put a hand on his arm. He repressed a shiver, reduced this reaction to a mentat computation. Something in her revolted him. Something in her. He could not bring himself to look at her. He smelled the melange of her cosmetics, cleared his throat. She said: \"I will be busy today examining Farad\u0027n\u0027s gifts.\" \"The clothing?\" \"Yes. Nothing he does is what it seems. And we must remember that his Bashar, Tyekanik, is an adept of chaumurky, chaumas, and all the other subtleties of royal assassination.\" \"The price of power,\" he said, pulling away from her. \"But we\u0027re still mobile and Farad\u0027n is not.\" She studied his chiseled profile. Sometimes the workings of his mind were difficult to fathom. Was he thinking only that freedom of action gave life to a military power? Well, life on Arrakis had been too secure for too long. Senses once whetted by omnipresent dangers could degenerate when not used. \"Yes,\" she said, \"we still have the Fremen.\" \"Mobility,\" he repeated. \"We cannot degenerate into infantry. That\u0027d be foolish.\" His tone annoyed her, and she said: \"Farad\u0027n will use any means to destroy us.\" \"Ahhh, that\u0027s it,\" he said. \"That\u0027s a form of initiative, a mobility which we didn\u0027t have in the old days. We had a code, the code of House Atreides. We always paid our way and let the enemy be the pillagers. That restriction no longer holds, of course. We\u0027re equally mobile. House Atreides and House Corrino.\" \"We abduct my mother to save her from harm as much as for any other reason,\" Alia said. \"We still live by the code!\" He looked down at her. She knew the dangers of inciting a mentat to compute. Didn\u0027t she realize what he had computed? Yet... he still loved her. He brushed a hand across his eyes. How youthful she looked. The Lady Jessica was correct: Alia gave the appearance of not having aged a day in their years together. She still possessed the soft features of her Bene Gesserit mother, but her eyes were Atreides - measuring, demanding, hawklike. And now something possessed of cruel calculation lurked behind those eyes. Idaho had served House Atreides for too many years not to understand the family\u0027s strengths as well as their weaknesses. But this thing in Alia, this was new. The Atreides might play a devious game against enemies, but never against friends and allies, and not at all against Family. It was ground into the Atreides manner: support your own populace to the best of your ability; show them how much better they lived under the Atreides. Demonstrate your love for your friends by the candor of your behavior with them. What Alia asked now, though, was not Atreides. He felt this with all of his body\u0027s flesh and nerve structure. He was a unit, indivisible, feeling this alien attitude in Alia. Abruptly his mentat sensorium clicked into full awareness and his mind leaped into the frozen trance where Time did not exist; only the computation existed. Alia would recognize what had happened to him, but that could not be helped. He gave himself up to the computation. Computation: A reflected Lady Jessica lived out a pseudo-life in Alia\u0027s awareness. He saw this as he saw the reflected pre-ghola Duncan Idaho which remained a constant in his own awareness. Alia had this awareness by being one of the pre-born. He had it out of the Tleilaxu regeneration tanks. Yet Alia denied that reflection, risked her mother\u0027s life. Therefore Alia was not in contact with that pseudo-Jessica within. Therefore Alia was completely possessed by another pseudo-life to the exclusion of all others. Possessed! Alien! Abomination! Mentat fashion, he accepted this, turned to other facets of his problem. All of the Atreides were on this one planet. Would House Corrino risk attack from space? His mind flashed through the review of those conventions which had ended primitive forms of warfare: One - All planets were vulnerable to attack from space; ergo: retaliation / revenge facilities were set up off-planet by every House Major. Farad\u0027n would know that the Atreides had not omitted this elementary precaution. Two - Force shields were a complete defense against projectiles and explosives of non-atomic type, the basic reason why hand-to-hand conflict had reentered human combat. But infantry had its limits. House Corrino might have brought their Sardaukar back to a pre-Arrakeen edge, but they still could be no match for the abandoned ferocity of Fremen. Three - Planetary feudalism remained in constant danger from a large technical class, but the effects of the Butlerian Jihad continued as a damper on technological excesses. Ixians, Tleilaxu, and a few scattered outer planets were the only possible threat in this regard, and they were planet-vulnerable to the combined wrath of the rest of the Imperium. The Butlerian Jihad would not be undone. Mechanized warfare required a large technical class. The Atreides Imperium had channeled this force into other pursuits. No large technical class existed unwatched. And the Empire remained safely feudalist, naturally, since that was the best social form for spreading over widely dispersed wild frontiers - new planets. Duncan felt his mentat awareness coruscate as it shot through memory data of itself, completely impervious to the passage of time. Arriving at the conviction that House Corrino would not risk an illegal atomic attack, he did this in flash-computation, the main decisional pathway, but he was perfectly aware of the elements which went into this conviction: The Imperium commanded as many nuclear and allied weapons as all the Great Houses combined. At least half the Great Houses would react without thinking if House Corrino broke the Convention. The Atreides off-planet retaliation system would be joined by overwhelming force, and no need to summon any of them. Fear would do the calling. Salusa Secundus and its allies would vanish in hot clouds. House Corrino would not risk such a holocaust. They were undoubtedly sincere in subscribing to the argument that nuclear weapons were a reserve held for one purpose: defense of humankind should a threatening \"other intelligence\" ever be encountered. The computational thoughts had clean edges, sharp relief. There were no blurred between-places. Alia chose abduction and terror because she had become alien, non-Atreides. House Corrino was a threat, but not in the ways which Alia argued in Council. Alia wanted the Lady Jessica removed because that searing Bene Gesserit intelligence had seen what only now had become clear to him. Idaho shook himself out of the mentat trance, saw Alia standing in front of him, a coldly measuring expression on her face. \"Wouldn\u0027t you rather the Lady Jessica were killed?\" he asked. The alien-flash of her joy lay exposed before his eyes for a brief instant before being covered by false outrage. \"Duncan!\" Yes, this alien-Alia preferred matricide. \"You are afraid of your mother, not for her,\" he said. She spoke without a change in her measuring stare. \"Of course I am. She has reported about me to the Sisterhood.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Don\u0027t you know the greatest temptation for a Bene Gesserit?\" She moved closer to him, seductive, looked upward at him through her lashes. \"I thought only to keep myself strong and alert for the sake of the twins.\" \"You speak of temptation,\" he said, his voice mentat-flat. \"It\u0027s the thing which the Sisterhood hides most deeply, the thing they most fear. It\u0027s why they call me Abomination. They know their inhibitions won\u0027t hold me back. Temptation - they always speak with heavy emphasis: Great Temptation. You see, we who employ the Bene Gesserit teachings can influence such things as the internal adjustment of enzyme balance within our bodies. It can prolong youth - far longer than with melange. Do you see the consequences should many Bene Gesserits do this? It would be noticed. I\u0027m sure you compute the accuracy of what I\u0027m saying. Melange is what makes us the target for so many plots. We control a substance which prolongs life. What if it became known that Bene Gesserits controlled an even more potent secret? You see! Not one Reverend Mother would be safe. Abduction and torture of Bene Gesserits would become a most common activity.\" \"You\u0027ve accomplished this enzyme balancing.\" It was a statement, not a question. \"I\u0027ve defied the Sisterhood! My mother\u0027s reports to the Sisterhood will make the Bene Gesserits unswerving allies of House Corrino.\" How very plausible, he thought. He tested: \"But surely your own mother would not turn against you!\" \"She was Bene Gesserit long before she was my mother, Duncan, she permitted her own son, my brother, to undergo the test of the gom jabbar! She arranged it! And she knew he might not survive it! Bene Gesserits have always been short on faith and long on pragmatism. She\u0027ll act against me if she believes it\u0027s in the best interests of the Sisterhood.\" He nodded. How convincing she was. It was a sad thought. \"We must hold the initiative,\" she said. \"That\u0027s our sharpest weapon.\" \"There\u0027s the problem of Gurney Halleck,\" he said. \"Do I have to kill my old friend?\" \"Gurney\u0027s off on some spy errand in the desert,\" she said, knowing Idaho already was aware of this. \"He\u0027s safely out of the way.\" \"Very odd,\" he said, \"the Regent Governor of Caladan running errands here on Arrakis.\" \"Why not?\" Alia demanded. \"He\u0027s her lover - in his dreams if not in fact.\" \"Yes, of course.\" And he wondered that she did not hear the insincerity in his voice. \"When will you abduct her?\" Alia asked. \"It\u0027s better that you don\u0027t know.\" \"Yes... yes, I see. Where\u0027ll you take her?\" \"Where she cannot be found. Depend upon it; she won\u0027t be left here to threaten you.\" The glee in Alia\u0027s eyes could not be mistaken. \"But where will...\" \"If you do not know, then you can answer before a Truthsayer, if necessary, that you do not know where she is.\" \"Ahhh, clever, Duncan.\" Now she believes I will kill the Lady Jessica, he thought. And he said: \"Goodbye, beloved.\" She did not hear the finality in his voice, even kissed him lightly as he left. And all the way down through the sietchlike maze of Temple corridors, Idaho brushed at his eyes. Tleilaxu eyes were not immune to tears. You have loved Caladan And lamented its lost host - But pain discovers New lovers cannot erase Those forever ghost. -Refrain from The Habbanya Lament Stilgar quadrupled the sietch guard around the twins, but he knew it was useless. The lad was like his Atreides namesake, the grandfather Leto. Everyone who\u0027d known the original Duke remarked on it. Leto had the measuring look about him, and caution, yes, but all of it had to be evaluated against that latent wildness, the susceptibility to dangerous decisions. Ghanima was more like her mother. There was Chani\u0027s red hair, the set of Chani\u0027s eyes, and a calculating way about her when she adjusted to difficulties. She often said that she only did what she had to do, but where Leto led she would follow. And Leto was going to lead them into danger. Not once did Stilgar think of taking his problem to Alia. That ruled out Irulan, who ran to Alia with anything and everything. In coming to his decision, Stilgar realized he had accepted the possibility that Leto judged Alia correctly. She uses people in a casual and callous way, he thought. She even uses Duncan that way. It isn\u0027t so much that she\u0027d turn on me and kill me. She\u0027d discard me. Meanwhile the guard was strengthened and Stilgar stalked his sietch like a robed specter, prying everywhere. All the time, his mind seethed with the doubts Leto had planted there. If one could not depend upon tradition, then where was the rock upon which to anchor his life? On the afternoon of the Convocation of Welcome for the Lady Jessica, Stilgar spied Ghanima standing with her grandmother at the entrance lip to the sietch\u0027s great assembly chamber. It was early and Alia had not yet arrived, but people already were thronging into the chamber, casting surreptitious glances at the child and adult as they passed. Stilgar paused in a shadowed alcove out of the crowd flow and watched the pair of them, unable to hear their words above the murmuring throb of an assembling multitude. The people of many tribes would be here today to welcome back their old Reverend Mother. But he stared at Ghanima. Her eyes, the way they danced when she spoke! The movement fascinated him. Those deep blue, steady, demanding, measuring eyes. And that way of throwing her red-gold hair off her shoulder with a twist of the head: that was Chani. It was a ghostly resurrection, an uncanny resemblance. Slowly Stilgar drew closer and took up his station in another alcove. He could not associate Ghanima\u0027s observing manner with any other child of his experience - except her brother. Where was Leto? Stilgar glanced back up the crowded passage. His guards would have spread an alarm if anything were amiss. He shook his head. These twins assaulted his sanity. They were a constant abrasion against his peace of mind. He could almost hate them. Kin were not immune from one\u0027s hatred, but blood (and its precious water) carried demands for one\u0027s countenance which transcended most other concerns. These twins existed as his greatest responsibility. Dust-filtered brown light came from the cavernous assembly chamber beyond Ghanima and Jessica. It touched the child\u0027s shoulders and the new white robe she wore, backlighting her hair as she turned to peer into the passage at the people thronging past. Why did Leto afflict me with these doubts? he wondered. There was no doubt that it had been done deliberately. Perhaps Leto wanted me to have a small share of his own mental experience. Stilgar knew why the twins were different, but had always found his reasoning processes unable to accept what he knew. He had never experienced the womb as prison to an awakened consciousness - a living awareness from the second month of gestation, so it was said. Leto had once said that his memory was like \"an internal holograph, expanding in size and in detail from that original shocked awakening, but never changing shape or outline.\" For the first time, as he watched Ghanima and the Lady Jessica, Stilgar began to understand what it must be like to live in such a scrambled web of memories, unable to retreat or find a sealed room of the mind. Faced with such a condition, one had to integrate madness, to select and reject from a multitude of offerings in a system where answers changed as fast as the question. There could be no fixed tradition. There could be no absolute answers to double-faced questions. What works? That which does not work. What does not work? That which works. He recognized this pattern. It was the old Fremen game of riddles. Question: \"It brings death and life.\" Answer: \"The Coriolis wind.\" Why did Leto want me to understand this? Stilgar asked himself. From his cautious probings, Stilgar knew that the twins shared a common view of their difference: they thought of it as affliction. The birth canal would be a draining place to such a one, he thought. Ignorance reduces the shock of some experiences, but they would have no ignorance about birth. What would it be like to live a life where you knew all of the things that could go wrong? You would face a constant war with doubts. You would resent your difference from your fellows. It would be pleasant to inflict others with even a taste of that difference. \"Why me?\" would be your first unanswered question. And what have I been asking myself? Stilgar thought. A wry smile touched his lips. Why me? Seeing the twins in this new way, he understood the dangerous chances they took with their uncompleted bodies. Ghanima had put it to him succinctly once after he\u0027d berated her for climbing the precipitous west face to the rim above Sietch Tabr. \"Why should I fear death? I\u0027ve been there before - many times.\" How can I presume to teach such children? Stilgar wondered. How can anyone presume? Oddly, Jessica\u0027s thoughts were moving in a similar vein as she talked to her granddaughter. She\u0027d been thinking how difficult it must be to carry mature minds in immature bodies. The body would have to learn what the mind already knew it could do - aligning responses and reflexes. The old Bene Gesserit prana-bindu regimen would be available to them, but even there the mind would run where the flesh could not. Gurney had a supremely difficult task carrying out her orders. \"Stilgar is watching us from an alcove back there,\" Ghanima said. Jessica did not turn. But she found herself confounded by what she heard in Ghanima\u0027s voice. Ghanima loved the old Fremen as one would love a parent. Even while she spoke lightly of him and teased him, she loved him. The realization forced Jessica to see the old Naib in a new light, understanding in a gestalten revelation what the twins and Stilgar shared. This new Arrakis did not fit Stilgar well, Jessica realized. No more than this new universe fitted her grandchildren. Unwanted and undemanded, a Bene Gesserit saying flowed through Jessica\u0027s mind: \"To suspect your own mortality is to know the beginning of terror; to learn irrefutably that you are mortal is to know the end of terror.\" Yes, death would not be a hard yoke to wear, but life was a slow fire to Stilgar and the twins. Each found an ill fitting world and longed for other ways where variations might be known without threat. They were children of Abraham, learning more from a hawk stooping over the desert than from any book yet written. Leto had confounded Jessica only that morning as they\u0027d stood beside the qanat which flowed below the sietch. He\u0027d said: \"Water traps us, grandmother. We\u0027d be better off living like dust because then the wind could carry us higher than the highest cliffs of the Shield Wall.\" Although she was familiar with such devious maturity from the mouths of these children, Jessica had been caught by this utterance, but had managed: \"Your father might\u0027ve said that.\" And Leto, throwing a handful of sand into the air to watch it fall: \"Yes, he might\u0027ve. But my father did not consider then how quickly water makes everything fall back to the ground from which it came.\" Now, standing beside Ghanima in the sietch, Jessica felt the shock of those words anew. She turned, glanced back at the still-flowing throng, let her gaze wander across Stilgar\u0027s shadowy shape in the alcove. Stilgar was no tame Fremen, trained only to carry twigs to the nest. He was still a hawk. When he thought of the color red, he did not think of flowers but of blood. \"You\u0027re so quiet, suddenly,\" Ghanima said. \"Is something wrong?\" Jessica shook her head. \"It\u0027s something Leto said this morning, that\u0027s all.\" \"When you went out to the plantings? What\u0027d he say?\" Jessica thought of the curious look of adult wisdom which had come over Leto\u0027s face out there in the morning. It was the same look which came over Ghanima\u0027s face right now. \"He was recalling the time when Gurney came back from the smugglers to the Atreides banner,\" Jessica said. \"Then you were talking about Stilgar,\" Ghanima said. Jessica did not question how this insight occurred. The twins appeared capable of reproducing each other\u0027s thought trains at will. \"Yes, we were,\" Jessica said. \"Stilgar didn\u0027t like to hear Gurney calling... Paul his Duke, but Gurney\u0027s presence forced this upon all of the Fremen. Gurney kept saying \u0027My Duke.\u0027 \" \"I see,\" Ghanima said. \"And of course, Leto observed that he was not yet Stilgar\u0027s Duke.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"You know what he was doing to you, of course,\" Ghanima said. \"I\u0027m not sure I do,\" Jessica admitted, and she found this admission particularly disturbing because it had not occurred to her that Leto was doing anything at all to her. \"He was trying to ignite your memories of our father,\" Ghanima said. \"Leto\u0027s always hungry to know our father from the viewpoints of others who knew him.\" \"But... doesn\u0027t Leto have...\" \"Oh, he can listen to the inner life. Certainly. But that\u0027s not the same. You spoke about him, of course. Our father, I mean. You spoke of him as your son.\" \"Yes.\" Jessica clipped it off. She did not like the feeling that these twins could turn her on and off at will, open her memories for observation, touch any emotion which attracted their interest. Ghanima might be doing that right now! \"Leto said something to disturb you,\" Ghanima said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-11.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
