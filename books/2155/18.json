{"id":97162,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Farad\u0027n turned a measuring stare on Idaho, looked to the Bashar. \"What think you, Tyek?\"\n The Bashar apparently was having thoughts similar to those Jessica professed. He said: \"I like her reasoning. Caution!\"\n \"He\u0027s a ghola-mentat,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"We could test him to the death and not find a certain answer.\"\n \"But it\u0027s a safe working assumption that we may\u0027ve been tricked,\" Tyekanik said.\n Jessica knew the moment had come to make her move. Now if Idaho\u0027s grief only kept him locked in the part he\u0027d chosen. She disliked using him this way, but there were larger considerations.\n \"To begin with,\" Jessica said, \"I might announce publicly that I came here of my own free choice.\"\n \"Interesting,\" Farad\u0027n said.\n \"You\u0027d have to trust me and grant me the complete freedom of Salusa Secundus,\" Jessica said. \"There could be no appearance that I spoke out of compulsion.\"\n \"No!\" Wensicia protested.\n Farad\u0027n ignored her. \"What reason would you give?\"\n \"That I\u0027m the Sisterhood\u0027s plenipotentiary sent here to take over your education.\"\n \"But the Sisterhood accuses -\"\n \"That\u0027d require a decisive action from you,\" Jessica said.\n \"Don\u0027t trust her!\" Wensicia said.\n With extreme politeness, Farad\u0027n glanced at her, said: \"If you interrupt me once more, I\u0027ll have Tyek remove you. He heard you consent to the formal investiture. That binds him to me now.\"\n \"She\u0027s a witch, I tell you!\" Wensicia looked to the mute against the side wall.\n Farad\u0027n hesitated. Then: \"Tyek, what think you? Have I been witched?\"\n \"Not in my judgment. She -\"\n \"You\u0027ve both been witched!\"\n \"Mother.\" His tone was flat and final.\n Wensicia clenched her fists, tried to speak, whirled, and fled the room.\n Addressing himself once more to Jessica, Farad\u0027n asked: \"Would the Bene Gesserit consent to this?\"\n \"They would.\"\n Farad\u0027n absorbed the implications of this, smiled tightly. \"What does the Sisterhood want in all of this?\"\n \"Your marriage to my granddaughter.\"\n Idaho shot a questioning look at Jessica, made as though to speak, but remained silent.\n Jessica said: \"You were going to say something, Duncan?\"\n \"I was going to say that the Bene Gesserit want what they\u0027ve always wanted: a universe which won\u0027t interfere with them.\"\n \"An obvious assumption,\" Farad\u0027n said, \"but I hardly see why you intrude with it.\"\n Idaho\u0027s eyebrows managed the shrug which the shigawire would not permit his body. Disconcertingly, he smiled.\n Farad\u0027n saw the smile, whirled to confront Idaho. \"I amuse you?\"\n \"This whole situation amuses me. Someone in your family has compromised the Spacing Guild by using them to carry instruments of assassination to Arrakis, instruments whose intent could not be concealed. You\u0027ve offended the Bene Gesserit by killing a male they wanted for their breeding pro -\"\n \"You call me a liar, ghola?\"\n \"No. I believe you didn\u0027t know about the plot. But I thought the situation needed bringing into focus.\"\n \"Don\u0027t forget that he\u0027s a mentat,\" Jessica cautioned.\n \"My very thought,\" Farad\u0027n said. Once more he faced Jessica. \"Let us say that I free you and you make your announcement. That still leaves the matter of your grandson\u0027s death. The mentat is correct.\"\n \"Was it your mother?\" Jessica asked.\n \"My Lord!\" Tyekanik warned.\n \"It\u0027s all right, Tyek.\" Farad\u0027n waved a hand easily. \"And if I say it was my mother?\"\n Risking everything in the test of this internal break among the Corrino, Jessica said: \"You must denounce her and banish her.\"\n \"My Lord,\" Tyekanik said, \"there could be trickery within trickery here.\"\n Idaho said: \"And the Lady Jessica and I are the ones who\u0027ve been tricked.\"\n Farad\u0027n\u0027s jaw hardened.\n And Jessica thought: Don\u0027t interfere, Duncan! Not now! But Idaho\u0027s words had sent her own Bene Gesserit abilities at logic into motion. He shocked her. She began to wonder if there were the possibility that she was being used in ways she didn\u0027t understand. Ghanima and Leto... The pre-born could draw upon countless inner experiences, a storehouse of advice far more extensive than the living Bene Gesserit depended upon. And there was that other question: Had her own Sisterhood been completely candid with her? They still might not trust her. After all, she\u0027d betrayed them once... to her Duke.\n Farad\u0027n looked at Idaho with a puzzled frown. \"Mentat, I need to know what this Preacher is to you.\"\n \"He arranged the passage here. I... We did not exchange ten words. Others acted for him. He could be... He could be Paul Atreides, but I don\u0027t have enough data for certainty. All I know for certain is that it was time for me to leave and he had the means.\"\n \"You speak of being tricked,\" Farad\u0027n reminded him.\n \"Alia expects you to kill us quietly and conceal the evidence of it,\" Idaho said. \"Having rid her of the Lady Jessica, I\u0027m no longer useful. And the Lady Jessica, having served her Sisterhood\u0027s purposes, is no longer useful to them. Alia will be calling the Bene Gesserit to account, but they will win.\"\n Jessica closed her eyes in concentration. He was right! She could hear the mentat firmness in his voice, that deep sincerity of pronouncement. The pattern fell into place without a chink. She took two deep breaths and triggered the mnemonic trance, rolled the data through her mind, came out of the trance and opened her eyes. It was done while Farad\u0027n moved from in front of her to a position within half a step of Idaho - a space of no more than three steps.\n \"Say no more, Duncan,\" Jessica said, and she thought mournfully of how Leto had warned her against Bene Gesserit conditioning.\n Idaho, about to speak, closed his mouth.\n \"I command here,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"Continue, mentat.\"\n Idaho remained silent.\n Farad\u0027n half turned to study Jessica.\n She stared at a point on the far wall, reviewing what Idaho and the trance had built. The Bene Gesserit hadn\u0027t abandoned the Atreides line, of course. But they wanted control of a Kwisatz Haderach and they\u0027d invested too much in the long breeding program. They wanted the open clash between Atreides and Corrino, a situation where they could step in as arbiters. And Duncan was right. They\u0027d emerge with control of both Ghanima and Farad\u0027n. It was the only compromise possible. The wonder was that Alia hadn\u0027t seen it. Jessica swallowed past a tightness in her throat. Alia... Abomination! Ghanima was right to pity her. But who was left to pity Ghanima?\n \"The Sisterhood has promised to put you on the throne with Ghanima as your mate,\" Jessica said.\n Farad\u0027n took a backward step. Did the witch read minds?\n \"They worked secretly and not through your mother,\" Jessica said. \"They told you I was not privy to their plan.\"\n Jessica read revelation in Farad\u0027n\u0027s face. How open he was. But it was true, the whole structure. Idaho had demonstrated masterful abilities as a mentat in seeing through to the fabric on the limited data available to him.\n \"So they played a double game and told you,\" Farad\u0027n said.\n \"They told me nothing of this,\" Jessica said. \"Duncan was correct: they tricked me.\" She nodded to herself. It had been a classic delaying action in the Sisterhood\u0027s traditional pattern - a reasonable story, easily accepted because it squared with what one might believe of their motives. But they wanted Jessica out of the way - a flawed sister who\u0027d failed them once.\n Tyekanik moved to Farad\u0027n\u0027s side. \"My Lord, these two are too dangerous to -\"\n \"Wait a bit, Tyek,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"There are wheels within wheels here.\" He faced Jessica. \"We\u0027ve had reasons to believe that Alia might offer herself as my bride.\"\n Idaho gave an involuntary start, controlled himself. Blood began dripping from his left wrist where the shigawire had cut.\n Jessica allowed herself a small, eye-widening response. She who\u0027d known the original Leto as lover, father of her children, confidant and friend, saw his trait of cold reasoning filtered now through the twistings of an Abomination.\n \"Will you accept?\" Idaho asked.\n \"It is being considered.\"\n \"Duncan, I told you to be silent,\" Jessica said. She addressed Farad\u0027n. \"Her price was two inconsequential deaths - the two of us.\"\n \"We suspected treachery,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"Wasn\u0027t it your son who said \u0027treachery breeds treachery?\u0027 \"\n \"The Sisterhood is out to control both Atreides and Corrino,\" Jessica said. \"Isn\u0027t that obvious?\"\n \"We\u0027re toying now with the idea of accepting your offer, Lady Jessica, but Duncan Idaho should be sent back to his loving wife.\"\n Pain is a function of nerves, Idaho reminded himself. Pain comes as light comes to the eyes. Effort comes from the muscles, not from nerves. It was an old mentat drill and he completed it in the space of one breath, flexed his right wrist and severed an artery against the shigawire.\n Tyekanik leaped to the chair, hit its trip lock to release the bindings, shouted for medical aid. It was revealing that assistants came swarming at once through doors hidden in wall panels.\n There was always a bit of foolishness in Duncan, Jessica thought.\n Farad\u0027n studied Jessica a moment while the medics ministered to Idaho. \"I didn\u0027t say I was going to accept his Alia.\"\n \"That\u0027s not why he cut his wrist,\" Jessica said.\n \"Oh? I thought he was simply removing himself.\"\n \"You\u0027re not that stupid,\" Jessica said. \"Stop pretending with me.\"\n He smiled. \"I\u0027m well aware that Alia would destroy me. Not even the Bene Gesserit could expect me to accept her.\"\n Jessica bent a weighted stare upon Farad\u0027n. What was this young scion of House Corrino? He didn\u0027t play the fool well. Again, she recalled Leto\u0027s words that she\u0027d encounter an interesting student. And The Preacher wanted this as well, Idaho said. She wished she\u0027d met this Preacher.\n \"Will you banish Wensicia?\" Jessica asked.\n \"It seems a reasonable bargain,\" Farad\u0027n said.\n Jessica glanced at Idaho. The medics had finished with him. Less dangerous restraints held him in the floater chair.\n \"Mentats should beware of absolutes,\" she said.\n \"I\u0027m tired,\" Idaho said. \"You\u0027ve no idea how tired I am.\"\n \"When it\u0027s overexploited, even loyalty wears out finally,\" Farad\u0027n said.\n Again Jessica shot that measuring stare at him.\n Farad\u0027n, seeing this, thought: In time she\u0027ll know me for certain and that could be valuable. A renegade Bene Gesserit of my own! It\u0027s the one thing her son had that I don\u0027t have. Let her get only a glimpse of me now. She can see the rest later.\n \"A fair exchange,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"I accept your offer on your terms.\" He signaled the mute against the wall with a complex flickering of fingers. The mute nodded. Farad\u0027n bent to the chair\u0027s controls, released Jessica.\n Tyekanik asked: \"My Lord, are you sure?\"\n \"Isn\u0027t it what we discussed?\" Farad\u0027n asked.\n \"Yes, but...\"\n Farad\u0027n chuckled, addressed Jessica. \"Tyek suspects my sources. But one learns from books and reels only that certain things can be done. Actual learning requires that you do those things.\"\n Jessica mused on this as she lifted herself from the chair. Her mind returned to Farad\u0027n\u0027s hand signals. He had an Atreides-style battle language! It spoke of careful analysis. Someone here was consciously copying the Atreides.\n \"Of course,\" Jessica said, \"you\u0027ll want me to teach you as the Bene Gesserit are taught.\"\n Farad\u0027n beamed at her. \"The one offer I cannot resist,\" he said.\n The password was given to me by a man who died in the dungeons of Arrakeen. You see, that is where I got this ring in the shape of a tortoise. It was in the suk outside the city where I was hidden by the rebels. The password? Oh, that has been changed many times since then. It was \"Persistence.\" And the countersign was \"Tortoise.\" It got me out of there alive. That\u0027s why I bought this ring: a reminder. -Tagir Mohandis: Conversations with a Friend\n Leto was far out on the sand when he heard the worm behind him, coming to his thumper there and the dusting of spice he\u0027d spread around the dead tigers. There was a good omen for this beginning of their plan: worms were scarce enough in these parts most times. The worm was not essential, but it helped. There would be no need for Ghanima to explain a missing body.\n By this time he knew that Ghanima had worked herself into the belief that he was dead. Only a tiny, isolated capsule of awareness would remain to her, a walled-off memory which could be recalled by words uttered in the ancient language shared only by the two of them in all of this universe. Secher Nbiw. If she heard those words: Golden Path... only then would she remember him. Until then, he was dead.\n Now Leto felt truly alone.\n He moved with the random walk which made only those sounds natural to the desert. Nothing in his passage would tell that worm back there that human flesh moved here. It was a way of walking so deeply conditioned in him that he didn\u0027t need to think about it. The feet moved of themselves, no measurable rhythm to their pacing. Any sound his feet made could be ascribed to the wind, to gravity. No human passed here.\n When the worm had done its work behind him, Leto crouched behind a dune\u0027s slipface and peered back toward The Attendant. Yes, he was far enough. He planted a thumper and summoned his transportation. The worm came swiftly, giving him barely enough time to position himself before it engulfed the thumper. As it passed, he went up its side on the Maker hooks, opened the sensitive leading edge of a ring, and turned the mindless beast southeastward. It was a small worm, but strong. He could sense the strength in its twisting as it hissed across the dunes. There was a following breeze and he felt the heat of their passage, the friction which the worm converted to the beginnings of spice within itself.\n As the worm moved, his mind moved. Stilgar had taken him up for his first worm journey. Leto had only to let his memory flow and he could hear Stilgar\u0027s voice: calm and precise, full of politeness from another age. Not for Stilgar the threatening staggers of a Fremen drunk on spice-liquor. Not for Stilgar the loud voice and bluster of these times. No - Stilgar had his duties. He was an instructor of royalty: \"In the olden times, the birds were named for their songs. Each wind had its name. A six-klick wind was called a Pastaza, a twenty-klick wind was Cueshma, and a hundred-klick wind was Heinali - Heinali, the man-pusher. Then there was the wind of the demon in the open desert: Hulasikali Wala, the wind that eats flesh.\"\n And Leto, who\u0027d already known these things, had nodded his gratitude at the wisdom of such instruction.\n But Stilgar\u0027s voice could be filled with many valuable things.\n \"There were in olden times certain tribes which were known to be water hunters. They were called Iduali, which meant \u0027water insects,\u0027 because those people wouldn\u0027t hesitate to steal the water of another Fremen. If they caught you alone in the desert they would not even leave you the water of your flesh. There was this place where they lived: Sietch Jacurutu. That\u0027s where the other tribes banded and wiped out the Iduali. That was a long time ago, before Kynes even - in my great-great-grandfather\u0027s days. And from that day to this, no Fremen has gone to Jacurutu. It is tabu.\"\n Thus had Leto been reminded of knowledge which lay in his memory. It had been an important lesson about the working of memory. A memory was not enough, even for one whose past was as multiform as his, unless its use was known and its value revealed to judgment. Jacurutu would have water, a wind trap, all of the attributes of a Fremen sietch, plus the value without compare that no Fremen would venture there. Many of the young would not even know such a place as Jacurutu had ever existed. Oh, they would know about Fondak, of course, but that was a smuggler place.\n It was a perfect place for the dead to hide - among the smugglers and the dead of another age.\n Thank you, Stilgar.\n The worm tired before dawn. Leto slid off its side and watched it dig itself into the dunes, moving slowly in the familiar pattern of the creatures. It would go deep and sulk.\n I must wait out the day, he thought.\n He stood atop a dune and scanned all around: emptiness, emptiness, emptiness. Only the wavering track of the vanished worm broke the pattern.\n The slow cry of a nightbird challenged the first green line of light along the eastern horizon. Leto dug himself into the sand\u0027s concealment, inflated a stilltent around his body and sent the tip of a sandsnorkel questing for air.\n For a long time before sleep came, he lay in the enforced darkness thinking about the decision he and Ghanima had made. It had not been an easy decision, especially for Ghanima. He had not told her all of his vision, nor all of the reasoning derived from it. It was a vision, not a dream, in his thinking now. But the peculiarity of this thing was that he saw it as a vision of a vision. If any argument existed to convince him that his father still lived, it lay in that vision-vision.\n The life of the prophet locks us into his vision, Leto thought. And a prophet could only break out of the vision by creating his death at variance with that vision. That was how it appeared in Leto\u0027s doubled vision, and he pondered this as it related to the choice he had made. Poor Baptist John, he thought. If he\u0027d only had the courage to die some other way... But perhaps his choice had been the bravest one. How do I know what alternatives faced him? I know what alternatives faced my father, though.\n Leto sighed. To turn his back on his father was like betraying a god. But the Atreides Empire needed shaking up. It had fallen into the worst of Paul\u0027s vision. How casually it obliterated men. It was done without a second thought. The mainspring of a religious insanity had been wound tight and left ticking.\n And we\u0027re locked in my father\u0027s vision.\n A way out of that insanity lay along the Golden Path, Leto knew. His father had seen it. But humanity might come out of that Golden Path and look back down it at Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s time, seeing that as a better age. Humankind had to experience the alternative to Muad\u0027Dib, though, or never understand its own myths.\n Security... peace... prosperity...\n Given the choice, there was little doubt what most citizens of this Empire would select.\n Though they hate me, he thought. Though Ghani hate me.\n His right hand itched, and he thought of the terrible glove in his vision-vision. It will be, he thought. Yes, it will be.\n Arrakis, give me strength, he prayed. His planet remained strong and alive beneath him and around him. Its sand pressed close against the stilltent. Dune was a giant counting its massed riches. It was a beguiling entity, both beautiful and grossly ugly. The only coin its merchants really knew was the bloodpulse of their own power, no matter how that power had been amassed. They possessed this planet the way a man might possess a captive mistress, or the way the Bene Gesserits possessed their Sisters.\n No wonder Stilgar hated the merchant-priests.\n Thank you, Stilgar.\n Leto recalled then the beauties of the old sietch ways, the life lived before the coming of the Imperium\u0027s technocracy, and his mind flowed as he knew Stilgar\u0027s dreams flowed. Before the glow-globes and lasers, before the ornithopters and spice-crawlers, there\u0027d been another kind of life: brown-skinned mothers with babies on their hips, lamps which burned spice-oil amidst a heavy fragrance of cinnamon, Naibs who persuaded their people while knowing none could be compelled. It had been a darkswarming of life in rocky burrows...\n A terrible glove will restore the balance, Leto thought.\n Presently, he slept.\n I saw his blood and a piece of his robe which had been ripped by sharp claws. His sister reports vividly of the tigers, the sureness of their attack. We have questioned one of the plotters, and others are dead or in custody. Everything points to a Corrino plot. A Truthsayer has attested to this testimony. -Stilgar\u0027s Report to the Landsraad Commission\n Farad\u0027n studied Duncan Idaho through the spy circuit, seeking a clue to that strange man\u0027s behavior. It was shortly after noon and Idaho waited outside the quarters assigned to the Lady Jessica, seeking audience with her. Would she see him? She\u0027d know they were spied upon, of course. But would she see him?\n Around Farad\u0027n lay the room where Tyekanik had guided the training of the Laza tigers - an illegal room, really, filled as it was with forbidden instruments from the hands of the Tleilaxu and Ixians. By the movement of switches at his right hand, Farad\u0027n could look at Idaho from six different angles, or shift to the interior of the Lady Jessica\u0027s suite where the spying facilities were equally sophisticated.\n Idaho\u0027s eyes bothered Farad\u0027n. Those pitted metal orbs which the Tleilaxu had given their ghola in the regrowth tanks marked their possessor as profoundly different from other humans. Farad\u0027n touched his own eyelids, feeling the hard surfaces of the permanent contact lenses which concealed the total blue of his spice addiction. Idaho\u0027s eyes must record a different universe. How could it be otherwise? It almost tempted Farad\u0027n to seek out the Tleilaxu surgeons and answer that question himself.\n Why did Idaho try to kill himself?\n Was that really what he\u0027d tried? He must\u0027ve known we wouldn\u0027t permit it.\n Idaho remained a dangerous question mark.\n Tyekanik wanted to keep him on Salusa or kill him. Perhaps that would be best.\n Farad\u0027n shifted to a frontal view. Idaho sat on a hard bench outside the door to the Lady Jessica\u0027s suite. It was a windowless foyer with light wood walls decorated by lance pennants. Idaho had been on that bench more than an hour and appeared ready to wait there forever. Farad\u0027n bent close to the screen. The loyal swordmaster of the Atreides, instructor of Paul Muad\u0027Dib, had been treated kindly by his years on Arrakis. He\u0027d arrived with a youthful spring in his step. A steady spice diet must have helped him, of course. And that marvelous metabolic balance which the Tleilaxu tanks always imparted. Did Idaho really remember his past before the tanks? No other whom the Tleilaxu had revived could claim this. What an enigma this Idaho was!\n The reports of his death were in the library. The Sardaukar who\u0027d slain him reported his prowess: nineteen of their number dispatched by Idaho before he\u0027d fallen. Nineteen Sardaukar! His flesh had been well worth sending to the regrowth tanks. But the Tleilaxu had made a mentat out of him. What a strange creature lived in that regrown flesh. How did it feel to be a human computer in addition to all of his other talents?\n Why did he try to kill himself?\n Farad\u0027n knew his own talents and held few illusions about them. He was a historian-archaeologist and judge of men. Necessity had forced him to become an expert on those who would serve him - necessity and a careful study of the Atreides. He saw it as the price always demanded of aristocracy. To rule required accurate and incisive judgments about those who wielded your power. More than one ruler had fallen through mistakes and excesses of his underlings.\n Careful study of the Atreides revealed a superb talent in choosing servants. They\u0027d known how to maintain loyalty, how to keep a fine edge on the ardor of their warriors.\n Idaho was not acting in character.\n Why?\n Farad\u0027n squinted his eyes, trying to see past the skin of this man. There was a sense of duration about Idaho, a feeling that he could not be worn down. He gave the impression of being self-contained, an organized and firmly integrated whole. The Tleilaxu tanks had set something more than human into motion. Farad\u0027n sensed this. There was a self-renewing movement about the man, as though he acted in accordance with immutable laws, beginning anew at every ending. He moved in a fixed orbit with an endurance about him like that of a planet around a star. He would respond to pressure without breaking - merely shifting his orbit slightly but not really changing anything basic.\n Why did he cut his wrist?\n Whatever his motive, he had done it for the Atreides, for his ruling House. The Atreides were the star of his orbit.\n Somehow he believes that my holding the Lady Jessica here strengthens the Atreides. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-18.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) \n The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
