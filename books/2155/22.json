{"id":97166,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Irulan glanced at Alia, stood up and crossed to stand facing Ghanima. \"Ghani, I\u0027d kill him myself if that were the way to solve matters. And Farad\u0027n\u0027s my own blood, as you so kindly emphasized. But you have duties far higher than your commitment to Fremen...\"\\n\\n \"That doesn\u0027t sound any better coming from you than it does from my precious aunt,\" Ghanima said. \"The blood of a brother cannot be washed off. That\u0027s more than some little Fremen aphorism.\"\\n\\n Irulan pressed her lips together. Then: \"Farad\u0027n holds your grandmother captive. He holds Duncan and if we don\u0027t -\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not satisfied with your stories of how all this happened,\" Ghanima said, peering past Irulan at Alia. \"Once Duncan died rather than let enemies take my father. Perhaps this new ghola-flesh is no longer the same as -\"\\n\\n \"Duncan was charged with protecting your grandmother\u0027s life!\" Alia said, whirling in her chair. \"I\u0027m confident he chose the only way to do that.\" And she thought: Duncan! Duncan! You weren\u0027t supposed to do it this way.\\n\\n Ghanima, reading the overtones of contrivance in Alia\u0027s voice, stared across at her aunt. \"You\u0027re lying, O Womb of Heaven. I\u0027ve heard about your fight with my grandmother. What is it you fear to tell us about her and your precious Duncan?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve heard it all,\" Alia said, but she felt a stab of fear at this bald accusation and what it implied. Fatigue had made her careless, she realized. She arose, said: \"Everything I know, you know.\" Turning to Irulan: \"You work on her. She must be made to -\"\\n\\n Ghanima interrupted with a coarse Fremen expletive which came shockingly from the immature lips. Into the quick silence she said: \"You think me just a mere child, that you have years in which to work on me, that eventually I\u0027ll accept. Think again, O Heavenly Regent. You know better than anyone the years I have within me. I\u0027ll listen to them, not to you.\"\\n\\n Alia barely suppressed an angry retort, stared hard at Ghanima. Abomination? Who was this child? A new fear of Ghanima began to rise in Alia. Had she accepted her own compromise with the lives which came to her pre-born? Alia said: \"There\u0027s time yet for you to see reason.\"\\n\\n \"There may be time yet for me to see Farad\u0027n\u0027s blood spurt around my knife,\" Ghanima said. \"Depend on it. If I\u0027m ever left alone with him, one of us will surely die.\"\\n\\n \"You think you loved your brother more than I?\" Irulan demanded. \"You play a fool\u0027s game! I was mother to him as I was to you. I was -\"\\n\\n \"You never knew him, \"Ghanima said. \"All of you, except at times my beloved aunt, persist in thinking us children. You\u0027re the fools! Alia knows! Look at her run away from...\"\\n\\n \"I run from nothing,\" Alia said, but she turned her back on Irulan and Ghanima, and stared at the two amazons who were pretending not to hear this argument. They\u0027d obviously given up on Ghanima. Perhaps they sympathized with her. Angrily, Alia sent them from the room. Relief was obvious on their faces as they obeyed.\\n\\n \"You run,\" Ghanima persisted.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve chosen a way of life which suits me,\" Alia said, turning back to stare at Ghanima sitting cross-legged on the cot. Was it possible she\u0027d made that terrible inner compromise? Alia tried to see the signs of it in Ghanima, but was unable to read a single betrayal. Alia wondered then: Has she seen it in me? But how could she?\\n\\n \"You feared to be the window for a multitude,\" Ghanima accused. \"But we\u0027re the preborn and we know. You\u0027ll be their window, conscious or unconscious. You cannot deny them.\" And she thought: Yes, I know you - Abomination. And perhaps I\u0027ll go as you have gone, but for now I can only pity you and despise you.\\n\\n Silence hung between Ghanima and Alia, an almost palpable thing which alerted the Bene Gesserit training in Irulan. She glanced from one to the other, then: \"Why\u0027re you so quiet suddenly?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve just had a thought which requires considerable reflection,\" Alia said.\\n\\n \"Reflect at your leisure, dear aunt,\" Ghanima sneered.\\n\\n Alia, putting down fatigue-inflamed anger, said: \"Enough for now! Leave her to think. Perhaps she\u0027ll come to her senses.\"\\n\\n Irulan arose, said: \"It\u0027s almost dawn anyway. Ghani, before we go, would you care to hear the latest message from Farad\u0027n? He...\"\\n\\n \"I would not,\" Ghanima said. \"And hereafter, cease calling me by that ridiculous diminutive. Ghani! It merely supports the mistaken assumption that I\u0027m a child you can...\"\\n\\n \"Why\u0027d you and Alia grow so suddenly quiet?\" Irulan asked, reverting to her previous question, but casting it now in a delicate mode of Voice.\\n\\n Ghanima threw her head back in laughter. \"Irulan! You\u0027d try Voice on me?\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Irulan was taken aback.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d teach your grandmother to suck eggs,\" Ghanima said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d what?\"\\n\\n \"The fact that I remember the expression and you\u0027ve never even heard it before should give you pause,\" Ghanima said. \"It was an old expression of scorn when you Bene Gesserit were young. But if that doesn\u0027t chasten you, ask yourself what your royal parents could\u0027ve been thinking of when they named you Irulan? Or is it Ruinal?\"\\n\\n In spite of her training, Irulan flushed. \"You\u0027re trying to goad me, Ghanima.\"\\n\\n \"And you tried to use Voice on me. On me! I remember the first human efforts in that direction. I remember then, Ruinous Irulan. Now, get out of here, all of you.\"\\n\\n But Alia was intrigued now, caught by an inner suggestion which sluffed her fatigue aside. She said: \"Perhaps I\u0027ve a suggestion which could change your mind, Ghani.\"\\n\\n \"Still Ghani!\" A brittle laugh escaped Ghanima, then: \"Reflect but a moment: If I desire to kill Farad\u0027n, I need but fall in with your plans. I presume you\u0027ve thought of that. Beware of Ghani in a tractable mood. You see, I\u0027m being utterly candid with you.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I hoped,\" Alia said. \"If you...\"\\n\\n \"The blood of a brother cannot be washed away,\" Ghanima said. \"I\u0027ll not go before my Fremen loved ones a traitor to that. Never to forgive, never to forget. Isn\u0027t that our catechism? I warn you here, and I\u0027ll say it publicly: you cannot betroth me to Farad\u0027n. Who, knowing me would believe it? Farad\u0027n himself could not believe it. Fremen, hearing of such a betrothal, would laugh into their sleeves and say; \u0027See! She lures him into a trap.\u0027 If you...\"\\n\\n \"I understand that,\" Alia said, moving to Irulan\u0027s side. Irulan, she noted, was standing in shocked silence, aware already of where this conversation was headed.\\n\\n \"And so I would be luring him into a trap,\" Ghanima said. \"If that\u0027s what you want, I\u0027ll agree, but he may not fall. If you wish this false betrothal as the empty coin with which to buy back my grandmother and your precious Duncan, so be it. But it\u0027s on your head. Buy them back. Farad\u0027n, though, is mine. Him I\u0027ll kill.\"\\n\\n Irulan whirled to face Alia before she could speak. \"Alia! If we go back on our word...\" She let it hang there a moment while Alia smilingly reflected on the potential wrath among the Great Houses in Faufreluches Assembled, the destructive consequences to believe in Atreides honor, the loss of religious trust, all of the great and small building blocs which would tumble.\\n\\n \"It\u0027d rule against us,\" Irulan protested. \"All belief in Paul\u0027s prophethood would be destroyed. It... the Empire...\"\\n\\n \"Who could dare question our right to decide what is wrong and what is right?\" Alia asked, voice mild. \"We mediate between good and evil. I need but proclaim...\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t do this!\" Irulan protested. \"Paul\u0027s memory...\"\\n\\n \"Is just another tool of Church and State,\" Ghanima said. \"Don\u0027t speak foolishness, Irulan.\" Ghanima touched the crysknife at her waist, looked up at Alia. \"I\u0027ve misjudged my clever aunt, Regent of all that\u0027s Holy in Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s Empire. I have, indeed, misjudged you. Lure Farad\u0027n into our parlor if you will.\"\\n\\n \"This is recklessness,\" Irulan pleaded.\\n\\n \"You agree to this betrothal, Ghanima?\" Alia asked, ignoring Irulan.\\n\\n \"On my terms,\" Ghanima said, hand still on her crysknife.\\n\\n \"I wash my hands of this,\" Irulan said, actually wringing her hands. \"I was willing to argue for a true betrothal to heal -\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll give you a wound much more difficult to heal, Alia and I,\" Ghanima said. \"Bring him quickly, if he\u0027ll come. And perhaps he will. Would he suspect a child of my tender years? Let us plan the formal ceremony of betrothal to require his presence. Let there be an opportunity for me to be alone with him... just a minute or two...\"\\n\\n Irulan shuddered at this evidence that Ghanima was, after all, Fremen entire, child no different from adult in this terrible bloodiness. After all, Fremen children were accustomed to slay the wounded on the battlefield, releasing women from this chore that they might collect the bodies and haul them away to the deathstills. And Ghanima, speaking with the voice of a Fremen child, piled horror upon horror by the studied maturity of her words, by the ancient sense of vendetta which hung like an aura around her.\\n\\n \"Done,\" Alia said, and she fought to keep voice and face from betraying her glee. \"We\u0027ll prepare the formal charter of betrothal. We\u0027ll have the signatures witnessed by the proper assemblage from the Great Houses. Farad\u0027n cannot possibly doubt -\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll doubt, but he\u0027ll come,\" Ghanima said. \"And he\u0027ll have guards. But will they think to guard him from me?\"\\n\\n \"For the love of all that Paul tried to do,\" Irulan protested, \"let us at least make Farad\u0027n\u0027s death appear an accident, or the result of malice by outside -\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take joy in displaying my bloody knife to my brethren,\" Ghanima said.\\n\\n \"Alia, I beg you,\" Irulan said. \"Abandon this rash insanity. Declare kanly against Farad\u0027n, anything to -\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t require formal declaration of vendetta against him,\" Ghanima said. \"The whole Empire knows how we must feel.\" She pointed to the sleeve of her robe. \"We wear the yellow of mourning. When I exchange it for the black of a Fremen betrothed, will that fool anyone?\"\\n\\n \"Pray that it fools Farad\u0027n,\" Alia said, \"and the delegates of the Great Houses we invite to witness the -\"\\n\\n \"Every one of those delegates will turn against you,\" Irulan said. \"You know that!\"\\n\\n \"Excellent point,\" Ghanima said. \"Choose those delegates with care, Alia. They must be ones we won\u0027t mind eliminating later.\"\\n\\n Irulan threw up her arms in despair, turned and fled.\\n\\n \"Have her put under close surveillance lest she try to warn her nephew,\" Ghanima said.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t try to teach me how to conduct a plot,\" Alia said. She turned and followed Irulan, but at a slower pace. The guards outside and the waiting aides were sucked up in her wake like sand particles drawn into the vortex of a rising worm.\\n\\n Ghanima shook her head sadly from side to side as the door closed, thought: It\u0027s as poor Leto and I thought. Gods below! I wish it\u0027d been me the tiger killed instead of him.\\n\\n Many forces sought control of the Atreides twins and, when the death of Leto was announced, this movement of plot and counterplot was amplified. Note the relative motivations: the Sisterhood feared Alia, an adult Abomination, but still wanted those genetic characteristics carried by the Atreides. The Church hierarchy of Auqaf and Hajj saw only the power implicit in control of Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s heir. CHOAM wanted a doorway to the wealth of Dune. Farad\u0027n and his Sardaukar sought a return to glory for House Corrino. The Spacing Guild feared the equation Arrakis \u003d melange; without the spice they could not navigate. Jessica wished to repair what her disobedience to the Bene Gesserit had created. Few thought to ask the twins what their plans might be, until it was too late. -The Book of Kreos\\n\\n Shortly after the evening meal, Leto saw a man walking past the arched doorway to his chamber, and his mind went with the man. The passage had been left open and Leto had seen some activity out there - spice hampers being wheeled past, three women with the obvious off-world sophistication of dress which marked them as smugglers. This man who took Leto\u0027s mind walking might have been no different except that he moved like Stilgar, a much younger Stilgar.\\n\\n It was a peculiar walk his mind took. Time filled Leto\u0027s awareness like a stellar globe. He could see infinite timespaces, but he had to press into his own future before knowing in which moment his flesh lay. His multifaceted memory-lives surged and receded, but they were his now. They were like waves on a beach, but if they rose too high, he could command them and they would retreat, leaving the royal Harum behind.\\n\\n Now and again he would listen to those memory-lives. One would rise like a prompter, poking its head up out of the stage and calling cues for his behavior. His father came during the mind-walk and said: \"You are a child seeking to be a man. When you are a man, you will seek in vain for the child you were.\"\\n\\n All the while, he felt his body being plagued by the fleas and lice of an old sietch poorly maintained. None of the attendants who brought his heavily spice-laced food appeared bothered by the creatures. Did these people have immunity from such things, or was it only that they had lived with them so long they could ignore discomfort?\\n\\n Who were these people assembled around Gurney? How had they come to this place? Was this Jacurutu? His multi-memories produced answers he did not like. They were ugly people and Gurney was the ugliest. Perfection floated here, though, dormant and waiting beneath an ugly surface.\\n\\n Part of him knew he remained spice-bound, held in bondage by the heavy dosages of melange in every meal. His child\u0027s body wanted to rebel while her persona raved with the immediate presence of memories carried over from thousands of eons.\\n\\n His mind returned from its walk, and he wondered if his body had really stayed behind. Spice confused the senses. He felt the pressures of self-limitations piling up against him like the long barachan dunes of the bled slowly building themselves a ramp against a desert cliff. One day a few trickles of sand would flow over the cliff, then more and more and more... and only the sand would remain exposed to the sky.\\n\\n But the cliff would still be there underneath.\\n\\n I\u0027m still within the trance, he thought.\\n\\n He knew he would come soon to a branching of life and death. His captors kept sending him back into the spice thralldom, unsatisfied with his responses at every return. Always, treacherous Namri waited there with his knife. Leto knew countless pasts and futures, but he had yet to learn what would satisfy Namri... or Gurney Halleck. They wanted something outside of the visions. The life and death branching lured Leto. His life, he knew, would have to possess some inner meaning which carried it above the vision circumstances. Thinking of this demand, he felt that his inner awareness was his true being and his outer existence was the trance. This terrified him. He did not want to go back to the sietch with its fleas, its Namri, its Gurney Halleck.\\n\\n I\u0027m a coward, he thought.\\n\\n But a coward, even a coward, might die bravely with nothing but a gesture. Where was that gesture which could make him whole once more? How could he awaken from trance and vision into the universe which Gurney demanded? Without that turning, without an awakening from aimless visions, he knew he could die in a prison of his own choosing. In this he had at last come to cooperate with his captors. Somewhere he had to find wisdom, an inner balance which would reflect upon the universe and return to him an image of calm strength. Only then might he seek his Golden Path and survive the skin which was not his own.\\n\\n Someone was playing the baliset out there in the sietch. Leto felt that his body probably heard the music in the present. He sensed the cot beneath his back. He could hear music. It was Gurney at the baliset. No other fingers could quite compare with his mastery of that most difficult instrument. He played an old Fremen song, one called a hadith because of its internal narrative and the voice which invoked those patterns required for survival on Arrakis. The song told the story of human occupations within a sietch.\\n\\n Leto felt the music move him through a marvelous ancient cavern. He saw women trampling spice residue for fuel, curding the spice for fermentation, forming spice-fabrics. Melange was everywhere in the sietch.\\n\\n Those moments came when Leto could not distinguish between the music and the people of the cavern vision. The whine and slap of a power loom was the whine and slap of the baliset. But his inner eyes beheld fabrics of human hair, the long fur of mutated rats, threads of desert cotton, and strips curled from the skin of birds. He saw a sietch school. The eco-language of Dune raged through his mind on its wings of music. He saw the sun-powered kitchen, the long chamber where stillsuits were made and maintained. He saw weather forecasters reading the sticks they\u0027d brought in from the sand.\\n\\n Somewhere during this journey, someone brought him food and spooned it into his mouth, holding his head up with a strong arm. He knew this as a real-time sensation, but the marvelous play of motion continued within him.\\n\\n As though it came in the next instant after the spice-laden food, he saw the hurtling of a sandstorm. Moving images within the sand breath became the golden reflections of a moth\u0027s eyes, and his own life was reduced to the viscous trail of a crawling insect.\\n\\n Words from the Panoplia Prophetica raved through him: \"It is said that there is nothing firm, nothing balanced, nothing durable in all the universe - that nothing remains in its state, that each day, some time each hour, brings change.\"\\n\\n The old Missionaria Protectiva knew what they were doing, he thought. They knew about Terrible Purposes. They knew how to manipulate people and religions. Even my father didn\u0027t escape them, not in the end.\\n\\n There lay the clue he\u0027d been seeking. Leto studied it. He felt strength flowing back into his flesh. His entire multifaceted being turned over and looked out upon the universe. He sat up and found himself alone in the gloomy cell with only the light from the outer passage where the man had walked past and taken his mind an eon ago.\\n\\n \"Good fortune to us all!\" he called in the traditional Fremen way.\\n\\n Gurney Halleck appeared in the arched doorway, his head a black silhouette against the light from the outer passage.\\n\\n \"Bring light,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"You wish to be tested further?\"\\n\\n Leto laughed. \"No. It\u0027s my turn to test you.\"\\n\\n \"We shall see.\" Halleck turned away, returning in a moment with a bright blue glowglobe in the crook of his left elbow. He released it in the cell, allowing it to drift above their heads.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Namri?\" Leto asked.\\n\\n \"Just outside where I can call him.\"\\n\\n \"Ahh, Old Father Eternity always waits patiently,\" Leto said. He felt curiously released, poised on the edge of discovery.\\n\\n \"You call Namri by the name reserved for Shai-Hulud?\" Halleck asked.\\n\\n \"His knife\u0027s a worm\u0027s tooth,\" Leto said. \"Thus, he\u0027s Old Father Eternity.\"\\n\\n Halleck smiled grimly, but remained silent.\\n\\n \"You still wait to pass judgment on me,\" Leto said. \"And there\u0027s no way to exchange information, I\u0027ll admit, without making judgments. You can\u0027t ask the universe to be exact, though.\"\\n\\n A rustling sound behind Halleck alerted Leto to Namri\u0027s approach. He stopped half a pace to Halleck\u0027s left.\\n\\n \"Ahhh, the left hand of the damned,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not wise to joke about the Infinite and the Absolute,\" Namri growled. He glanced sideways at Halleck.\\n\\n \"Are you God, Namri, that you invoke absolutes?\" Leto asked. But he kept his attention on Halleck. Judgment would come from there.\\n\\n Both men merely stared at him without answering.\\n\\n \"Every judgment teeters on the brink of error,\" Leto explained. \"To claim absolute knowledge is to become monstrous. Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.\"\\n\\n \"What word game is this you play?\" Halleck demanded.\\n\\n \"Let him speak,\" Namri said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the game Namri initiated with me,\" Leto said, and saw the old Fremen\u0027s head nod agreement. He\u0027d certainly recognized the riddle game. \"Our senses always have at least two levels,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"Trivia and message,\" Namri said.\\n\\n \"Excellent!\" Leto said. \"You gave me trivia; I give you message. I see, I hear, I detect odors, I touch; I feel changes in temperature, taste. I sense the passage of time. I may take emotive samples. Ahhhhh! I am happy. You see, Gurney? Namri? There\u0027s no mystery about a human life. It\u0027s not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.\"\\n\\n \"You try our patience, lad,\" Namri said. \"Is this the place where you wish to die?\"\\n\\n But Halleck put out a restraining hand.\\n\\n \"First, I am not a lad,\" Leto said. He made the first sign at his right ear. \"You\u0027ll not slay me; I\u0027ve placed a water burden upon you.\"\\n\\n Namri drew his crysknife half out of its sheath. \"I owe you nothing!\"\\n\\n \"But God created Arrakis to train the faithful,\" Leto said. \"I\u0027ve not only showed you my faith, I\u0027ve made you conscious of your own existence. Life requires dispute. You\u0027ve been made to know - by me! - that your reality differs from all others; thus, you know you\u0027re alive.\"\\n\\n \"Irreverence is a dangerous game to play with me,\" Namri said. He held his crysknife half drawn.\\n\\n \"Irreverence is a most necessary ingredient of religion,\" Leto said. \"Not to speak of its importance in philosophy. Irreverence is the only way left to us for testing our universe.\"\\n\\n \"So you think you understand the universe?\" Halleck asked, and he opened a space between himself and Namri\\n\\n \"Ye-esss,\" Namri said, and there was death in his voice.\\n\\n \"The universe can be understood only by the wind,\" Leto said. \"There\u0027s no mighty seat of reason which dwells within the brain. Creation is discovery. God discovered us in the Void because we moved against a background which He already knew. The wall was blank. Then there was movement.\"\\n\\n \"You play hide and seek with death,\" Halleck warned.\\n\\n \"But you are both my friends,\" Leto said. He faced Namri. \"When you offer a candidate as Friend of your Sietch, do you not slay a hawk and an eagle as the offering? And is this not the response: \u0027God send each man at his end, such hawks, such eagles, and such friends\u0027?\"\\n\\n Namri\u0027s hand slid from his knife. The blade slipped back into its sheath. He stared wide-eyed at Leto. Each sietch kept its friendship ritual secret, yet here was a selected part of the rite.\\n\\n Halleck, though, asked: \"Is this place your end?\"\\n\\n \"I know what you need to hear from me, Gurney,\" Leto said, watching the play of hope and suspicion across the ugly face. Leto touched his own breast. \"This child was never a child. My father lives within me, but he is not me. You loved him, and he was a gallant human whose affairs beat upon high shores. His intent was to close down the cycle of wars, but he reckoned without the movement of infinity as expressed by life. That\u0027s Rhajia! Namri knows. Its movement can be seen by any mortal. Beware paths which narrow future possibilities. Such paths divert you from infinity into lethal traps.\"\\n\\n \"What is it I need to hear from you?\" Halleck asked.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just word playing,\" Namri said, but his voice carried deep hesitation, doubts.\\n\\n \"I ally myself with Namri against my father,\" Leto said. \"And my father within allies himself with us against what was made of him.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" Halleck demanded.\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s the amor fati which I bring to humankind, the act of ultimate self-examination. In this universe, I choose to ally myself against any force which brings humiliation upon humankind. Gurney! Gurney! You were not born and raised in the desert. Your flesh doesn\u0027t know the truth of which I speak. But Namri knows. In the open land, one direction is as good as another.\"\\n\\n \"I still have not heard what I must hear,\" Halleck snarled.\\n\\n \"He speaks for war and against peace,\" Namri said.\\n\\n \"No,\" Leto said. \"Nor did my father speak against war. But look what was made of him. Peace has only one meaning in this Imperium. It\u0027s the maintenance of a single way of life. You are commanded to be contented. Life must be uniform on all planets as it is in the Imperial Government. The major object of priestly study is to find the correct forms of human behavior. For this they go to the words of Muad\u0027Dib! Tell me, Namri, are you content?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" The words came out flat, spontaneous rejection.\\n\\n \"Then do you blaspheme?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not!\"\\n\\n \"But you aren\u0027t contented. You see, Gurney? Namri proves it to us. Every question, every problem doesn\u0027t have a single correct answer. One must permit diversity. A monolith is unstable. Then why do you demand a single correct statement from me? Is that to be the measure of your monstrous judgment?\"\\n\\n \"Will you force me to have you slain?\" Halleck asked, and there was agony in his voice.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027ll have pity upon you,\" Leto said. \"Send word to my grandmother that I\u0027ll cooperate. The Sisterhood may come to regret my cooperation, but an Atreides gives his word.\"\\n\\n \"A Truthsayer should test that,\" Namri said. \"These Atreides...\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll have his chance to say before his grandmother what must be said,\" Halleck said. He nodded with his head toward the passage.\\n\\n Namri paused before leaving, glanced at Leto. \"I pray we do the right thing in leaving him alive.\"\\n\\n \"Go, friends,\" Leto said. \"Go and reflect.\"\\n\\n As the two men departed, Leto threw himself onto his back, feeling the cold cot against his spine. Movement sent his head spinning over the edge of his spice-burdened consciousness. In that instant he saw the entire planet - every village, every town, every city, the desert places and the planted places. All of the shapes which smashed against his vision bore intimate relationships to a mixture of elements within themselves and without. He saw the structures of Imperial society reflected in physical structures of its planets and their communities. Like a gigantic unfolding within him, he saw this revelation for what it must be: a window into the society\u0027s invisible parts. Seeing this, Leto realized that every system had such a window. Even the system of himself and his universe. He began peering into windows, a cosmic voyeur.\\n\\n This was what his grandmother and the Sisterhood sought! He knew it. His awareness flowed on a new, higher level. He felt the past carried in his cells, in his memories, in the archetypes which haunted his assumptions, in the myths which hemmed him, in his languages and their prehistoric detritus. It was all of the shapes out of his human and nonhuman past, all of the lives which he now commanded, all integrated in him at last. And he felt himself as a thing caught up in the ebb and flow of nucleotides. Against the backdrop of infinity he was a protozoan creature in which birth and death were virtually simultaneous, but he was both infinite and protozoan, a creature of molecular memories.\\n\\n We humans are a form of colony organism! he thought.\\n\\n They wanted his cooperation. Promising cooperation had won him another reprieve from Namri\u0027s knife. By summoning to cooperation, they sought to recognize a healer.\\n\\n And he thought: But I\u0027ll not bring them social order in the way they expect it!\\n\\n A grimace contorted Leto\u0027s mouth.
