Javid\u0027s there with a delegation from the Priesthood. But I\u0027d like you at Tabr to watch them, especially Irulan.\"\n \"She is Corrino,\" he agreed.\n But he saw in her eyes that she was rejecting him. How transparent this Alia-creature had become!\n She waved a hand. \"Go now, Duncan, before I soften and keep you here beside me. I\u0027ve missed you so...\"\n \"And I\u0027ve missed you,\" he said, allowing all of his grief to flow into his voice.\n She stared at him, startled by the sadness. Then: \"For my sake, Duncan.\" And she thought: Too bad, Duncan. She said: \"Zia will take you to Tabr. We need the \u0027thopter back here.\"\n Her pet amazon, he thought: I must be careful of that one.\n \"I understand,\" he said, once more taking her hand and kissing it. He stared at the dear flesh which once had been his Alia\u0027s. He could not bring himself to look at her face as he left. Someone else stared back at him from her eyes.\n As he mounted to the Keep\u0027s roof pad, Idaho probed a growing sense of unanswered questions. The meeting with Alia had been extremely trying for the mentat part of him which kept reading data signs. He waited beside the \u0027thopter with one of the Keep\u0027s amazons, stared grimly southward. Imagination took his gaze beyond the Shield Wall to Sietch Tabr. Why does Zia take me to Tabr? Returning a \u0027thopter is a menial task. What is the delay? Is Zia getting special instructions?\n Idaho glanced at the watchful guard, mounted to the pilot\u0027s position in the \u0027thopter. He leaned out, said: \"Tell Alia I\u0027ll send the \u0027thopter back immediately with one of Stilgar\u0027s men.\"\n Before the guard could protest he closed the door and started the \u0027thopter. He could see her standing there indecisively. Who could question Alia\u0027s consort? He had the \u0027thopter airborne before she could make up her mind what to do.\n Now, alone in the \u0027thopter, he allowed his grief to spend itself in great wracking sobs. Alia was gone. They had parted forever. Tears flowed from his Tleilaxu eyes and he whispered: \"Let all the waters of Dune flow into the sand. They will not match my tears.\"\n This was a non-mentat excess, though, and he recognized it as such, forcing himself to sober assessment of present necessities. The \u0027thopter demanded his attention. The reactions of flying brought him some relief, and he had himself once more in hand.\n Ghanima with Stilgar again. And Irulan.\n Why had Zia been designated to accompany him? He made it a mentat problem and the answer chilled him. I was to have a fatal accident.\n This rocky shrine to the skull of a ruler grants no prayers. It has become the grave of lamentations. Only the wind hears the voice of this place. The cries of night creatures and the passing wonder of two moons, all say his day has ended. No more supplicants come. The visitors have gone from the feast. How bare the pathway down this mountain. -Lines at the Shrine of an Atreides Duke, Anon.\n The thing had the deceptive appearance of simplicity to Leto: avoiding the vision, do that which has not been seen. He knew the trap in his thought, how the casual threads of a locked future twisted themselves together until they held you fast, but he had a new grip on those threads. Nowhere had he seen himself running from Jacurutu. The thread to Sabiha must be cut first.\n He crouched now in the last daylight at the eastern edge of the rock which protected Jacurutu. His Fremkit had produced energy tablets and food. He waited now for strength. To the west lay Lake Azrak, the gypsum plain where once there\u0027d been open water in the days before the worm. Unseen to the east lay the Bene Sherk, a scattering of new settlements encroaching upon the open bled. To the south lay the Tanzerouft, the Land of Terror: thirty-eight hundred kilometers of wasteland broken only by patches of grass-locked dunes and windtraps to water them - the work of the ecological transformation remaking the landscape of Arrakis. They were serviced by airborne teams and no one stayed for long.\n I will go south, he told himself. Gurney will expect me to do that. This was not the moment to do the completely unexpected.\n It would be dark soon and he could leave this temporary hiding place. He stared at the southern skyline. There was a whistling of dun sky along that horizon, rolling there like smoke, a burning line of undulant dust - a storm. He watched the high center of the storm rising up out of the Great Flat like a questing worm. For a full minute he watched the center, saw that it did not move to the right or the left. The old Fremen saying leaped into his mind: When the center does not move, you are in its path.\n That storm changed matters.\n For a moment he stared back westward the direction of Tabr, feeling the deceptive grey-tan peace of the desert evening, seeing the white gypsum pan edged by wind-rounded pebbles, the desolate emptiness with its unreal surface of glaring white reflecting dust clouds. Nowhere in any vision had he seen himself surviving the grey serpent of a mother storm or buried too deeply in sand to survive. There was only that vision of rolling in wind... but that might come later.\n And a storm was out there, winding across many degrees of latitude, whipping its world into submission. It could be risked. There were old stories, always heard from a friend of a friend, that one could lock an exhausted worm on the surface by propping a Maker hook beneath one of its wide rings and, having immobilized it, ride out a storm in the leeward shadow. There was a line between audacity and abandoned recklessness which tempted him. That storm would not come before midnight at the earliest. There was time. How many threads could be cut here? All, including the final one?\n Gurney will expect me to go south, but not into a storm.\n He stared down to the south, seeking a pathway, saw the fluent ebony brushstroke of a deep gorge curving through Jacurutu\u0027s rock. He saw sand curls in the bowels of the gorge, chimera sand. It uttered its haughty runnels onto the plain as though it were water. The gritty taste of thirst whispered in his mouth as he shouldered his Fremkit and let himself down onto the path which led into the canyon. It was still light enough that he might be seen, but he knew he was gambling with time.\n As he reached the canyon\u0027s lip, the quick night of the central desert fell upon him. He was left with the parched glissando of moonglow to light his way toward the Tanzerouft. He felt his heartbeat quicken with all of the fears which his wealth of memories provided. He sensed that he might be going down into Huanui-naa, as Fremen fears labeled the greatest storms: the Earth\u0027s Deathstill. But whatever came, it would be visionless. Every step left farther behind him the spice-induced dhyana, that spreading awareness of his intuitive-creative nature with its unfolding to the motionless chain of causality. For every hundred steps he took now, there must be at least one step aside, beyond words and into communion with his newly grasped internal reality.\n One way or another, father, I\u0027m coming to you.\n There were birds invisible in the rocks around him, making themselves known by small sounds. Fremen-wise, he listened for their echoes to guide his way where he could not see. Often as he passed crannies he marked the baleful green of eyes, creatures crouched in hiding because they knew a storm approached.\n He emerged from the gorge onto the desert. Living sand moved and breathed beneath him, telling of deep actions and latent fumaroles. He looked back and up to the moon-touched lava caps on Jacurutu\u0027s buttes. The whole structure was metamorphic, mostly pressure-formed. Arrakis still had something to say in its own future. He planted his thumper to call a worm and, when it began beating against the sand, took his position to watch and listen. Unconsciously his right hand went to the Atreides hawk ring concealed in a knotted fold of his dishsasha. Gurney had found it, but had left it. What had he thought, seeing Paul\u0027s ring?\n Father, expect me soon.\n The worm came from the south. It angled in to avoid the rocks, not as large a worm as he\u0027d hoped, but that could not be remedied. He gauged its passage, planted his hooks, and went up the scaled side with a quick scrambling as it swept over the thumper in a swishing dust spray. The worm turned easily under the pressure of his hooks. The wind of its passage began to whip his robe. He bent his gaze on the southern stars, dim through dust, and pointed the worm that way.\n Right into the storm.\n As First Moon rose, Leto gauged the storm height and put off his estimate of its arrival. Not before daylight. It was spreading out, gathering more energy for a great leap. There\u0027d be plenty of work for the ecological transformation teams. It was as though the planet fought them with a conscious fury out here, the fury increasing as the transformation took in more land.\n All night he pressed the worm southward, sensing the reserves of its energy in the movements transmitted through his feet. Occasionally he let the beast fall off to the west which it was forever trying to do, moved by the invisible boundaries of its territory or by a deep-seated awareness of the coming storm. Worms buried themselves to escape the sandblast winds, but this one would not sink beneath the desert while Maker hooks held any of its rings open.\n At midnight the worm was showing many signs of exhaustion. He moved back along its great ridges and worked the flail, allowing it to slow down but continuing to drive it southward.\n The storm arrived just after daybreak. First there was the beady stretched-out immobility of the desert dawn pressing dunes one into another. Next, the advancing dust caused him to seal his face flaps. In the thickening dust the desert became a dun picture without lines. Then sand needles began cutting his cheeks, stinging his lids. He felt the coarse grit on his tongue and knew the moment of decision had come. Should he risk the old stories by immobilizing the almost exhausted worm? He took only a heartbeat to discard this choice, worked his way back to the worm\u0027s tail, slacked off his hooks. Barely moving now, the worm began to burrow. But the excesses of the creature\u0027s heat-transfer system still churned up a cyclone oven behind him in the quickening storm. Fremen children learned the dangers of this position near the worm\u0027s tail with their earliest stories. Worms were oxygen factories; fire burned wildly in their passage, fed by the lavish exhalations from the chemical adaptations to friction within them.\n Sand began to whip around his feet. Leto loosed his hooks and leaped wide to avoid the furnace at the tail. Everything depended now on getting beneath the sand where the worm had loosened it.\n Grasping the static compaction tool in his left hand, he burrowed into a dune\u0027s slipface, knowing the worm was too tired to turn back and swallow him in its great white-orange mouth. As he burrowed with his left hand, his right hand worked the stilltent from his Fremkit and he readied it for inflation. It was all done in less than a minute: he had the tent into a hard-walled sand pocket on the lee face of a dune. He inflated the tent and crawled into it. Before sealing the sphincter, he reached out with the compaction tool, reversed its action. The slipface came sliding down over the tent. Only a few sand grains entered as he sealed the opening.\n Now he had to work even more quickly. No sandsnorkel would reach up there to keep him supplied with breathing air. This was a great storm, the kind few survived. It would cover this place with tons of sand. Only the tender bubble of the stilltent with its compacted outer shell would protect him.\n Leto stretched flat on his back, folded his hands over his breast and sent himself into a dormancy trance where his lungs would move only once an hour. In this he committed himself to the unknown. The storm would pass and, if it did not expose his fragile pocket, he might emerge... or he might enter the Madinat as-salam, the Abode of Peace. Whatever happened, he knew he had to break the threads, one by one, leaving him at last only the Golden Path. It was that, or he could not return to the caliphate of his father\u0027s heirs. No more would he live the lie of that Desposyni, that terrible caliphate, chanting to the demiurge of his father. No more would he keep silent when a priest mouthed offensive nonsense: \"His crysknife will dissolve demons!\"\n With this commitment, Leto\u0027s awareness slipped into the web of timeless dao.\n There exist obvious higher-order influences in any planetary system. This is often demonstrated by introducing terraform life onto newly discovered planets. In all such cases, the life in similar zones develops striking similarities of adaptive form. This form signifies much more than shape; it connotes a survival organization and a relationship of such organizations. The human quest for this interdependent order and our niche within it represents a profound necessity. The quest can, however, be perverted into a conservative grip on sameness. This has always proved deadly for the entire system. -The Dune Catastrophe, After Harq al-Ada\n \"My son didn\u0027t really see the future; he saw the process of creation and its relationship to the myths in which men sleep,\" Jessica said. She spoke swiftly but without appearing to rush the matter. She knew the hidden observers would find a way to interrupt as soon as they recognized what she was doing.\n Farad\u0027n sat on the floor outlined in a shaft of afternoon sunlight which slanted through the window behind him. Jessica could just see the top of a tree in the courtyard garden when she glanced across from her position standing against the far wall. It was a new Farad\u0027n she saw: more slender, more sinewy. The months of training had worked their inevitable magic on him. His eyes glittered when he stared at her.\n \"He saw the shapes which existing forces would create unless they were diverted,\" Jessica said. \"Rather than turn against his fellow men, he turned against himself. He refused to accept only that which comforted him because that was moral cowardice.\" Farad\u0027n had learned to listen silently testing, probing, holding his questions until he had shaped them into a cutting edge. She had been talking about the Bene Gesserit view of molecular memory expressed as ritual and had, quite naturally, diverged to the Sisterhood\u0027s way of analyzing Paul Muad\u0027Dib. Farad\u0027n saw a shadow play in her words and actions, however, a projection of unconscious forms at variance with the surface intent of her statements.\n \"Of all our observations, this is the most crucial,\" she\u0027d said. \"Life is a mask through which the universe expresses itself. We assume that all of humankind and its supportive life forms represent a natural community and that the fate of all life is at stake in the fate of the individual. Thus, when it comes to that ultimate self-examination, the amor fati, we stop playing god and revert to teaching. In the crunch, we select individuals and we set them as free as we\u0027re able.\"\n He saw now where she had to be going and knowing its effect upon those who watched through the spy eyes, refrained from casting an apprehensive glance at the door. Only a trained eye could have detected his momentary imbalance, but Jessica saw it and smiled. A smile, after all, could mean anything.\n \"This is a sort of graduation ceremony,\" she said. \"I\u0027m very pleased with you, Farad\u0027n. Will you stand, please.\" He obeyed, blocking off her view of the treetop through the window behind him.\n Jessica held her arms stiffly at her side, said: \"I am charged to say this to you. \u0027I stand in the sacred human presence. As I do now, so should you stand someday. I pray to your presence that this be so. The future remains uncertain and so it should, for it is the canvas upon which we paint our desires. Thus always the human condition faces a beautifully empty canvas. We possess only this moment in which to dedicate ourselves continuously to the sacred presence which we share and create.\u0027 \"\n As Jessica finished speaking, Tyekanik came through the door on her left, moving with a false casualness which the scowl on his face belied. \"My Lord,\" he said. But it already was too late. Jessica\u0027s words and all of the preparation which had gone before had done their work. Farad\u0027n no longer was Corrino. He was now Bene Gesserit.\n What you of the CHOAM directorate seem unable to understand is that you seldom find real loyalties in commerce. When did you last hear of a clerk giving his life for the company? Perhaps your deficiency rests in the false assumption that you can order men to think and cooperate. This has been a failure of everything from religions to general staffs throughout history. General staffs have a long record of destroying their own nations. As to religions, I recommend a rereading of Thomas Aquinas. As to you of CHOAM, what nonsense you believe! Men must want to do things out of their own innermost drives. People, not commercial organizations or chains of command, are what make great civilizations work. Every civilization depends upon the quality of the individuals it produces. If you over-organize humans, over-legalize them, suppress their urge to greatness - they cannot work and their civilization collapses. -A letter to CHOAM, Attributed to The Preacher\n Leto came out of the trance with a softness of transition which did not define one condition as separate from another. One level of awareness simply moved into the other.\n He knew where he was. A restoration of energy surged through him, but he sensed another message from the stale deadliness of the oxygen-depleted air within the stilltent. If he refused to move, he knew he would remain caught in the timeless web, the eternal now where all events coexisted. This prospect enticed him. He saw Time as a convention shaped by the collective mind of all sentience. Time and Space were categories imposed on the universe by his Mind. He had but to break free of the multiplicity where prescient visions lured him. Bold selection could change provisional futures.\n What boldness did this moment require?\n The trance state lured him. Leto felt that he had come from the alam al-mythal into the universe of reality only to find them identical. He wanted to maintain the Rihani magic of this revelation, but survival demanded decisions of him. His relentless taste for life sent its signals along his nerves.\n Abruptly he reached out his right hand to where he had left the sand-compaction tool. He gripped it, rolled onto his stomach, and breached the tent\u0027s sphincter. A pool of sand drifted across his hand. Working in darkness, goaded by the stale air, he worked swiftly, tunneling upward at a steep angle. Six times his body lengths he went before he broke out into darkness and clean air. He slipped out onto the moonlight windface of a long curving dune, found himself about a third of the way from the dune\u0027s top.\n It was Second Moon above him. It moved swiftly across him, departing beyond the dune, and the stars were laid out above him like bright rocks beside a path. Leto searched for the constellation of The Wanderer, found it, and let his gaze follow the outstretched arm to the brilliant glittering of Foum al-Hout, the polar star of the south.\n There\u0027s your damned universe for you! he thought. Seen close up it was a hustling place like the sand all around him, a place of change, of uniqueness piled upon uniqueness. Seen from a distance, only the patterns lay revealed and those patterns tempted one to belief in absolutes.\n In absolutes, we may lose our way. This made him think of the familiar warning from a Fremen ditty: \"Who loses his way in the Tanzerouft loses his life.\" The patterns could guide and they could trap. One had to remember that patterns change.\n He took a deep breath, stirred himself into action. Sliding back down his passage, he collapsed the tent, brought it out and repacked the Fremkit.\n A wine glow began to develop along the eastern horizon. He shouldered the pack, climbed to the dunecrest and stood there in the chill predawn air until the rising sun felt warm on his right cheek. He stained his eyepits then to reduce reflection, knowing that he must woo this desert now rather than fight her. When he had put the stain back into the pack he sipped from one of his catchtubes, drew in a sputtering of drops and then air.\n Dropping to the sand, he began going over his stillsuit, coming at last to the heel pumps. They had been cut cleverly with a needle knife. He slipped out of the suit and repaired it, but the damage had been done. At least half of his body\u0027s water was gone. Were it not for the stilltent\u0027s catch... He mused on this as he donned the suit, thinking how odd it was that he\u0027d not anticipated this. Here was an obvious danger of visionless future.\n Leto squatted on the dunetop then, pressed himself against the loneliness of this place. He let his gaze wander, fishing in the sand for a whistling vent, any irregularity of the dunes which might indicate spice or worm activity. But the storm had stamped its uniformity upon the land. Presently he removed a thumper from the kit, armed it, and sent it rotating to call Shai-Hulud from his depths. He then moved off to wait.\n The worm was a long time coming. He heard it before he saw it, turned eastward where the earthshaking susurration made the air tremble, waited for the first glimpse of orange from the mouth rising out of the sand. The worm lifted itself from the depths in a gigantic hissing of dust which obscured its flanks. The curving grey wall swept past Leto and he planted his hooks, went up the side in easy steps. He turned the worm southward in a great curving track as he climbed.\n Under his goading hooks, the worm picked up speed. Wind whipped his robe against him. He felt himself to be goaded as the worm was goaded, an intense current of creation in his loins. Each planet has its own period and each life likewise, he reminded himself.\n The worm was a type Fremen called a \"growler.\" It frequently dug in its foreplates while the tail was driving. This produced rumbling sounds and caused part of its body to rise clear of the sand in a moving hump. It was a fast worm, though, and when they picked up a following wind the furnace exhalation of his tail sent a hot breeze across him. It was filled with acrid odors carried on the freshet of oxygen.\n As the worm sped southward, Leto allowed his mind to run free. He tried to think of this passage as a new ceremony for his life, one which kept him from considering the price he\u0027d have to pay for his Golden Path. Like the Fremen of old, he knew he\u0027d have to adopt many new ceremonies to keep his personality from dividing into its memory parts, to keep the ravening hunters of his soul forever at bay. Contradictory images, never to be unified, must now be encysted in a living tension, a polarizing force which drove him from within.\n Always newness, he thought. I must always find the new threads out of my vision.\n In the early afternoon his attention was caught by a protuberance ahead and slightly to the right of his course. Slowly the protuberance became a narrow butte, an upthrust rock precisely where he\u0027d expected it.\n Now Namri... Now Sabiha, let us see how your brethren take to my presence, he thought. This was a most delicate thread ahead of him, dangerous more for its lures than its open threats.\n The butte was a long time changing dimensions. And it appeared for a while that it approached him instead of him approaching it.\n The worm, tiring now, kept veering left. Leto slid down the immense slope to set his hooks anew and keep the giant on a straight course. A soft sharpness of melange came to his nostrils, the signal of a rich vein. They passed the leprous blotches of violet sand where a spiceblow had erupted and he held the worm firmly until they were well past the vein. The breeze, redolent with the gingery odor of cinnamon, pursued them for a time until Leto rolled the worm onto its new course, headed directly toward the rising butte.\n Abruptly colors blinked far out on the southern bled: the unwary rainbow flashing of a man-made artifact in that immensity. He brought up his binoculars, focused the oil lenses, and saw in the distance the outbanking wings of a spice-scout glittering in the sunlight. Beneath it a big harvester was shedding its wings like a chrysalis before lumbering off. When Leto lowered the binoculars the harvester dwindled to a speck, and he felt himself overcome by the hadhdhab, the immense omnipresence of the desert, it told him how those spice-hunters would see him, a dark object between desert and sky, which was the Fremen symbol for man. They\u0027d see him, of course, and they\u0027d be cautious. They\u0027d wait. Fremen were always suspicious of one another in the desert until they recognized the newcomer or saw for certain that he posed no threat. Even within the fine patina of Imperial civilization and its sophisticated rules they remained half-tamed savages, aware always that a crysknife dissolved at the death of its owner.\n That\u0027s what can save us, Leto thought. That wildness.\n In the distance the spice-scout banked right, then left, a signal to the ground. He imagined the occupants scanning the desert behind him for sign that he might be more than a single rider on a single worm.\n Leto rolled the worm to the left, held it until it had reversed its course, dropped down the flank, and leaped clear. The worm, released from his goading, sulked on the surface for a few breaths, then sank its front third and lay there recuperating, a sure sign that it had been ridden too long.\n He turned away from the worm; it would stay there now. The scout was circling its crawler, still giving wing signals. They were smuggler-paid renegades for certain, wary of electronic communications. The hunters would be on spice out there. That was the message of the crawler\u0027s presence.\n The scout circled once more, dipped its wings, came out of the circle and headed directly toward him. He recognized it for a type of light \u0027thopter his grandfather had introduced on Arrakis. The craft circled once above him, went out along the dune where he stood, and banked to land against the breeze. It came down within ten meters of him, stirring up a scattering of dust. The door on his side cracked enough to emit a single figure in a heavy Fremen robe with a spear symbol at the right breast.\n The Fremen approached slowly, giving each of them time to study the other. The man was tall with the total indigo of spice-eyes. The stillsuit mask concealed the lower half of his face and the hood had been drawn down to protect his brows. The movement of the robe revealed a hand beneath it holding a maula pistol.\n The man stopped two paces from Leto, looked down at him with a puzzled crinkling around the eyes.\n \"Good fortune to us all,\" Leto said.\n The man peered all around, scanning the emptiness, then returned his attention to Leto. \"What do you here, child?\" he demanded. His voice was muffled by the stillsuit mask. \"Are you trying to be the cork in a wormhole?\"\n Again Leto used traditional Fremen formula: \"The desert is my home.\"\n \"Wenn?\" the man demanded. Which way do you go?\n \"I travel south from Jacurutu.\"\n An abrupt laugh erupted from the man. \"Well, Batigh! You are the strangest thing I\u0027ve ever seen in the Tanzerouft.\"\n \"I\u0027m not your Little Melon,\" Leto said, responding to Batigh. That was a label with dire overtones. The Little Melon on the desert\u0027s edge offered its water to any finder.\n \"We\u0027ll not drink you, Batigh,\" the man said. \"I am Muriz. I am the arifa of this taif.\" He indicated with a head motion the distant spice-crawler.\n Leto noted how the man called himself the Judge of his group and referred to the others as taif, a band or company. They were not ichwan, not a band of brothers. Paid renegades for sure. Here lay the thread he required.\n When Leto remained silent, Muriz asked: \"Do you have a name?\"\n \"Batigh will do.\"\n A chuckle shook Muriz. \"You\u0027ve not told me what you do here?\"\n \"I seek the footprints of a worm,\" Leto said, using the religious phrase which said he was on hajj for his own umma, his personal revelation.\n \"One so young?\" Muriz asked. He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know what to do with you. You have seen us.\"\n \"What have I seen?\" Leto asked. \"I speak of Jacurutu and you make no response.\"\n \"Riddle games,\" Muriz said. \"What is that, then?\" He nodded toward the distant butte.\n Leto spoke from his vision: \"Only Shuloch.\"\n Muriz stiffened and Leto felt his own pulse quicken.\n A long silence ensued and Leto could see the man debating and discarding various responses. Shuloch! In the quiet story time after a sietch meal, stories of the Shuloch caravanserie were often repeated. Listeners always assumed that Shuloch was a myth, a place for interesting things to happen and only for the sake of the story. Leto recalled a Shuloch story: A waif was found at the desert\u0027s edge and brought into the sietch. At first the waif refused to respond to his saviors, then when he spoke no one could understand his words. As days passed he continued unresponsive, refused to dress himself or cooperate in any way. Every time he was left alone he made odd motions with his hands. All the specialists in the sietch were called in to study this waif but arrived at no answer. Then a very old woman passed the doorway, saw the moving hands, and laughed. \"He only imitates his father who rolls the spice-fibers into rope,\" she explained. \"It\u0027s the way they still do it at Shuloch. He\u0027s just trying to feel less lonely.\" And the moral: \"In the old ways of Shuloch there is security and a sense of belonging to the golden thread of life\".\n As Muriz remained silent, Leto said: \"I\u0027m the waif from Shuloch who knows only to move his hands.\"\n In the quick movement of the man\u0027s head, Leto saw that Muriz knew the story. Muriz responded slowly, voice low and filled with menace. \"Are you human?\"\n \"Human as yourself,\" Leto said.\n \"You speak most strangely for a child. I remind you that I am a judge who can respond to the taqwa.\"\n Ah, yes, Leto thought. In the mouth of such a judge, the taqwa carried immediate threat. Taqwa was the fear invoked by the presence of a demon, a very real belief among older Fremen. The arifa knew the ways to slay a demon and was always chosen \"because he has the wisdom to be ruthless without being cruel, to know when kindness is in fact the way to greater cruelty.\"\n But this thing had come to the point which Leto sought, and he said: \"I can submit to the Mashhad.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be the judge of any Spiritual Test,\" Muriz said. \"Do you accept this?\"\n \"Bi-lal kaifa,\" Leto said. Without qualification.\n A sly look came over Muriz\u0027s face. He said: \"I don\u0027t know why I permit this. Best you were slain out of hand, but you\u0027re a small Batigh and I had a son who is dead. Come, we will go to Shuloch and I\u0027ll convene the Isnad for a decision about you.\"\n Leto, noting how the man\u0027s every mannerism betrayed deadly decision, wondered how anyone could be fooled by this. He said: \"I know Shuloch is the Ahl as-sunna wal-jamas.\"\n \"What does a child know of the real world?\" Muriz asked, motioning for Leto to precede him to the \u0027thopter.\n Leto obeyed, but listened carefully to the sound of the Fremen\u0027s footsteps. \"The surest way to keep a secret is to make people believe they already know the answer,\" Leto said. \"People don\u0027t ask questions then. It was clever of you who were cast out of Jacurutu. Who\u0027d believe Shuloch, the story-myth place, is real? And how convenient for the smugglers or anyone else who desires access to Dune.\"\n Muriz\u0027s footsteps stopped. Leto turned with his back against the \u0027thopter\u0027s side, the wing on his left.\n Muriz stood half a pace away with his maula pistol drawn and pointed directly at Leto. \"So you\u0027re not a child,\" Muriz said. \"A cursed midget come to spy on us! I thought you spoke too wisely for a child, but you spoke too much too soon.\"\n \"Not enough,\" Leto said. \"I\u0027m Leto, the child of Paul-Muad\u0027Dib. If you slay me, you and your people will sink into the sand. If you spare me, I\u0027ll lead you to greatness.\"\n \"Don\u0027t play games with me, midget,\" Muriz snarled. \"Leto is at the real Jacurutu from whence you say...\" He broke off. The gun hand dropped slightly as a puzzled frown made his eyes squint.\n It was the hesitation Leto had expected, He made every muscle indication of a move to the left which, deflecting his body no more than a millimeter, brought the Fremen\u0027s gun swinging wildly against the wing edge. The maula pistol flew from his hand and, before he could recover, Leto was beside him with Muriz\u0027s own crysknife pressed against the man\u0027s back.\n \"The tip\u0027s poisoned,\" Leto said. \"Tell your friend in the \u0027thopter that he\u0027s to remain exactly where he is without moving at all. Otherwise I\u0027ll be forced to kill you.\"\n Muriz, nursing his injured hand, shook his head at the figure in the \u0027thopter, said: \"My companion Behaleth has heard you. He will be as unmoving as the rock.\"\n Knowing he had very little time until the two worked out a plan of action or their friends came to investigate, Leto spoke swiftly: \"You need me, Muriz. Without me, the worms and their spice will vanish from Dune.\" He felt the Fremen stiffen.\n \"But how do you know of Shuloch?\" Muriz asked. \"I know they said nothing at Jacurutu.\"\n \"So you admit I\u0027m Leto Atreides?\"\n \"Who else could you be? But how do you -\"\n \"Because you are here,\" Leto said. \"Shuloch exists, therefore the rest is utter simplicity. You are the Cast Out who escaped when Jacurutu was destroyed. I saw you signal with your wings, therefore you use no device which could be overheard at a distance. You collect spice, therefore you trade. You could only trade with the smugglers. You are a smuggler, yet you are Fremen. You must be of Shuloch.\"\n \"Why did you tempt me to slay you out of hand?\"\n \"Because you would\u0027ve slain me anyway when we\u0027d returned to Shuloch.\"\n A violent rigidity came over Muriz\u0027s body.\n \"Careful, Muriz,\" Leto cautioned. \"I know about you. It was in your history that you took the water of unwary travelers. By now this would be common ritual with you. How else could you silence the ones who chanced upon you? How else keep your secret? Batigh! You\u0027d seduce me with gentle epithets and kindly words. Why waste any of my water upon the sand? And if I were missed as were many of the others - well, the Tanzerouft got me.\"\n Muriz made the Horns-of-the-Worm sign with his right hand to ward off the Rihani which Leto\u0027s words called up. And Leto, knowing how older Fremen distrusted mentats or anything which smacked of them by a show of extended logic, suppressed a smile.\n \"Manri spoke of us at Jacurutu,\" Muriz said. \"I will have his water when -\"\n \"You\u0027ll have nothing but empty sand if you continue playing the fool,\" Leto said. \"What will you do, Muriz, when all of Dune has become green grass, trees, and open water?\"\n \"It will never happen!\"\n \"It is happening before your eves.\"\n Leto heard Muriz\u0027s teeth grinding in rage and frustration. Presently the man grated: \"How would you prevent this?\"\n \"I know the entire plan of the transformation,\" Leto said. \"I know every weakness in it, every strength. Without me, Shai-Hulud will vanish forever.\"\n A sly note returning to his voice, Muriz asked: \"Well, why dispute it here? We\u0027re at a standoff. You have your knife. You could kill me, but Behaleth would shoot you.\"\n \"Not before I recovered your pistol,\" Leto said. \"Then I\u0027d have your \u0027thopter. Yes, I can fly it.\"\n A scowl creased Muriz\u0027s forehead beneath the hood. \"What if you\u0027re not who you say?\"\n \"Will my father not identify me?\" Leto asked.\n \"Ahhhh,\" Muriz said. \"There\u0027s how you learned, eh? But...\" He broke off, shook his head. \"My own son guides him. He says you two have never... How could...\"\n \"So you don\u0027t believe Muad\u0027Dib reads the future,\" Leto said.\n \"Of course we believe! But he says of himself that...\" Again Muriz broke off.\n \"And you thought him unaware of your distrust,\" Leto said. \"I came to this exact place in this exact time to meet you, Muriz. I know all about you because I\u0027ve seen you... and your son. I know how secure you believe yourselves, how you sneer at Muad\u0027Dib, how you plot to save your little patch of desert. But your little patch of desert is doomed without me, Muriz. Lost forever. It has gone too far here on Dune. My father has almost run out of vision, and you can only turn to me.\"\n \"That blind...\" Muriz stopped, swallowed.\n \"He\u0027ll return soon from Arrakeen,\" Leto said, \"and then we shall see how blind he is. How far have you gone from the old Fremen ways, Muriz?\"\n \"What?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-25.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) \n The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
