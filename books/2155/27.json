{"id":97170,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"For a long time Leto squatted at the qanat\u0027s edge, listening to the restless hiss of sand within the canyon beyond. A small worm by the sound of it; chosen for that reason, no doubt. A small worm would be easier to transport. He thought about the worm\u0027s capture: the hunters would dull it with a water mist, using the traditional Fremen method of taking a worm for the orgy/transformation rite. But this worm would not be killed by immersion. This one would go out on a Guild heighliner to some hopeful buyer whose desert probably would be too moist. Few off-worlders realized the basic desiccation which the sandtrout had maintained on Arrakis. Had maintained. Because even here in the Tanzerouft there would be many times more airborne moisture than any worm had ever before known short of its death in a Fremen cistern. He heard Sabiha stirring in the hut behind him. She was restless, prodded by her own suppressed visions. He wondered how it would be to live outside a vision with her, sharing each moment just as it came, of itself. The thought attracted him far more strongly than had any spice vision. There was a certain cleanliness about facing an unknown future. \"A kiss in the sietch is worth two in the city.\" The old Fremen maxim said it all. The traditional sietch had held a recognizable wildness mingled with shyness. There were traces of that shyness in the people of Jacurutu/Shuloch, but only traces. This saddened him by revealing what had been lost. Slowly, so slowly that the knowledge was fully upon him before he recognized its beginnings, Leto grew aware of the soft rustling of many creatures all around him. Sandtrout. Soon it would be time to shift from one vision to another. He felt the movement of sandtrout as a movement within himself. Fremen had lived with the strange creatures for generations, knowing that if you risked a bit of water as bait, you could lure them into reach. Many a Fremen dying of thirst had risked his last few drops of water in this gamble, knowing that the sweet green syrup teased from a sandtrout might yield a small profit in energy. But the sandtrout were mostly the game of children who caught them for the Huanui. And for play. Leto shuddered at the thought of what that play meant to him now. He felt one of the creatures slither across his bare foot. It hesitated, then went on, attracted by the greater amount of water in the qanat. For a moment, though, he\u0027d felt the reality of his terrible decision. The sandtrout glove. It was the play of children. If one held a sandtrout in the hand, smoothing it over your skin, it formed a living glove. Traces of blood in the skin\u0027s capillaries could be sensed by the creatures, but something mingled with the blood\u0027s water repelled them. Sooner or later, the glove would slip off into the sand, there to be lifted into a spice-fiber basket. The spice soothed them until they were dumped into the deathstill. He could hear sandtrout dropping into the qanat, the swirl of predators eating them. Water softened the sandtrout, made it pliable. Children learned this early. A bit of saliva teased out the sweet syrup. Leto listened to the splashing. This was a migration of sandtrout come up to the open water, but they could not contain a flowing qanat patrolled by predator fish. Still they came; still they splashed. Leto groped on the sand with his right hand until his fingers encountered the leathery skin of a sandtrout. It was the large one he had expected. The creature didn\u0027t try to evade him, but moved eagerly onto his flesh. He explored its outline with his free hand - roughly diamond-shaped. It had no head, no extremities, no eyes, yet it could find water unerringly. With its fellows it could join body to body, locking one on another by the coarse interlacings of extruded cilia until the whole became one large sack-organism enclosing the water, walling off the \"poison\" from the giant which the sandtrout would become: Shai-Hulud. The sandtrout squirmed on his hand, elongating, stretching. As it moved, he felt a counterpart elongating and stretching of the vision he had chosen. This thread, not that one. He felt the sandtrout becoming thin, covering more and more of his hand. No sandtrout had ever before encountered a hand such as this one, every cell supersaturated with spice. No other human had ever before lived and reasoned in such a condition. Delicately Leto adjusted his enzyme balance, drawing on the illuminated sureness he\u0027d gained in spice trance. The knowledge from those uncounted lifetimes which blended themselves within him provided the certainty through which he chose the precise adjustments, slaving off the death from an overdose which would engulf him if he relaxed his watchfulness for only a heartbeat. And at the same time he blended himself with the sandtrout, feeding on it, feeding it, learning it. His trance vision provided the template and he followed it precisely. Leto felt the sandtrout grow thin, spreading itself over more and more of his hand, reaching up his arm. He located another, placed it over the first one. Contact ignited a frenzied squirming in the creatures. Their cilia locked and they became a single membrane which enclosed him to the elbow. The sandtrout adjusted to the living glove of childhood play, but thinner and more sensitive as he lured it into the role of a skin symbiote. He reached down with the living glove, felt sand, each grain distinct to his senses. This was no longer sandtrout; it was tougher, stronger. And it would grow stronger and stronger... His groping hand encountered another sandtrout which whipped itself into union with the first two and adapted itself to the new role. Leathery softness insinuated itself up his arm to his shoulder. With a terrible singleness of concentration he achieved the union of his new skin with his body, preventing rejection. No corner of his attention was left to dwell upon the terrifying consequences of what he did here. Only the necessities of his trance vision mattered. Only the Golden Path could come from this ordeal. Leto shed his robe and lay naked upon the sand, his gloved arm outstretched into the path of migrating sandtrout. He remembered that once he and Ghanima had caught a sandtrout, abraded it against the sand until it contracted into the child-worm, a stiff tube, its interior pregnant with the green syrup. One bit gently upon the end and sucked swiftly before the wound was healed, gaining the few drops of sweetness. They were all over his body now. He could feel the pulse of his blood against the living membrane. One tried to cover his face, but he moved it roughly until it elongated into a thin roll. The thing grew much longer than the child-worm, remaining flexible. Leto bit the end of it, tasted a thin stream of sweetness which continued far longer than any Fremen had ever before experienced. He could feel energy from the sweetness flow through him. A curious excitement suffused his body. He was kept busy for a time rolling the membrane away from his face until he\u0027d built up a stiff ridge circling from jaw to forehead and leaving his ears exposed. Now the vision must be tested. He got to his feet, turned to run back toward the hut and, as he moved, found his feet moving too fast for him to balance. He plunged into the sand, rolled and leaped to his feet. The leap took him two meters off the sand and, when he fell back, trying to walk, he again moved too fast. Stop! he commanded himself. He fell into the prana-bindu forced relaxation, gathering his senses into the pool of consciousness. This focused the inward ripples of the constant-now through which he experienced Time, and he allowed the vision-elation to warm him. The membrane worked precisely as the vision had predicted. My skin is not my own. But his muscles took some training to live with this amplified movement. When he walked, he fell, rolling. Presently he sat. In the quiet, the ridge below his jaw tried to become a membrane covering his mouth. He spat against it and bit, tasting the sweet syrup. It rolled downward to the pressure of his hand. Enough time had passed to form the union with his body. Leto stretched flat and turned onto his face. He began to crawl, rasping the membrane against the sand. He could feel the sand distinctly, but nothing abraded his own flesh. With only a few swimming movements he traversed fifty meters of sand. The physical reaction was a friction-induced warming sensation. The membrane no longer tried to cover his nose and mouth, but now he faced the second major step onto his Golden Path. His exertions had taken him beyond the qanat into the canyon where the trapped worm stayed. He heard it hissing toward him, attracted by his movements. Leto leaped to his feet, intending to stand and wait, but the amplified movement sent him sprawling twenty meters farther into the canyon. Controlling his reactions with terrible effort, he sat back onto his haunches, straightened. Now the sand began to swell directly in front of him, rising up in a monstrous starlit curve. Sand opened only two body lengths from him. Crystal teeth flashed in the dim light. He saw the yawning mouth-cavern with, far back, the ambient movement of dim flame. The overpowering redolence of the spice swept over him. But the worm had stopped. It remained in front of him as First Moon lifted over the butte. The light reflected off the worm\u0027s teeth outlining the faery glow of chemical fires deep within the creature. So deep was the inbred Fremen fear that Leto found himself torn by a desire to flee. But his vision held him motionless, fascinated by this prolonged moment. No one had ever before stood this close to the mouth of a living worm and survived. Gently Leto moved his right foot, met a sand ridge and, reacting too quickly, was propelled toward the worm\u0027s mouth. He came to a stop on his knees. Still the worm did not move. It sensed only the sandtrout and would not attack the deep-sand vector of its own kind. The worm would attack another worm in its territory and would come to exposed spice. Only a water barrier stopped it - and sandtrout, encapsulating water, were a water barrier. Experimentally, Leto moved a hand toward that awesome mouth. The worm drew back a full meter. Confidence restored, Leto turned away from the worm and began teaching his muscles to live with their new power. Cautiously he walked back toward the qanat. The worm remained motionless behind him. When Leto was beyond the water barrier he leaped with joy, went sailing ten meters across the sand, sprawled, rolled, laughed. Light flared on the sand as the hut\u0027s doorseal was breached. Sabiha stood outlined in the yellow and purple glow of the lamp, staring out at him. Laughing, Leto ran back across the qanat, stopped in front of the worm, turned and faced her with his arms outstretched. \"Look!\" he called. \"The worm does my bidding!\" As she stood in frozen shock, he whirled, went racing around the worm and into the canyon. Gaining experience with his new skin, he found he could run with only the lightest flexing of muscles. It was almost effortless. When he put effort into running, he raced over the sand with the wind burning the exposed circle of his face. At the canyon\u0027s dead end instead of stopping, he leaped up a full fifteen meters, clawed at the cliff, scrabbled, climbing like an insect, and came out on the crest above the Tanzerouft. The desert stretched before him, a vast silvery undulance in the moonlight. Leto\u0027s manic exhilaration receded. He squatted, sensing how light his body felt. Exertion had produced a slick film of perspiration which a stillsuit would have absorbed and routed into the transfer tissue which removed the salts. Even as he relaxed, the film disappeared now, absorbed by the membrane faster than a stillsuit could have done it. Thoughtfully Leto rolled a length of the membrane beneath his lips, pulled it into his mouth, and drank the sweetness. His mouth was not masked, though. Fremen-wise, he sensed his body\u0027s moisture being wasted with every breath. Leto brought a section of the membrane over his mouth, rolled it back when it tried to seal his nostrils, kept at this until the rolled barrier remained in place. In the desert way, he fell into the automatic breathing pattern: in through his nose, out through his mouth. The membrane over his mouth protruded in a small bubble, but remained in place. No moisture collected on his lips and his nostrils remained open. The adaptation proceeded, then. A \u0027thopter flew between Leto and the moon, banked, and came in for a spread-wing landing on the butte perhaps a hundred meters to his left. Leto glanced at it, turned, and looked back the way he had come up the canyon. Many lights could be seen down there beyond the qanat, a stirring of a multitude. He heard faint outcries, sensed hysteria in the sounds. Two men approached him from the \u0027thopter. Moonlight glinted on their weapons. The Mashhad, Leto thought, and it was a sad thought. Here was the great leap onto the Golden Path. He had put on the living, self-repairing stillsuit of a sandtrout membrane, a thing of unmeasurable value on Arrakis... until you understood the price. I am no longer human. The legends about this night will grow and magnify it beyond anything recognizable by the participants. But it will become truth, that legend. He peered down from the butte, estimated the desert floor lay two hundred meters below. The moon picked out ledges and cracks on the steep face but no connecting pathway. Leto stood, inhaled a deep breath, glanced back at the approaching men, then stepped to the cliff\u0027s edge and launched himself into space. Some thirty meters down his flexed legs encountered a narrow ledge. Amplified muscles absorbed the shock and rebounded in a leap sideways to another ledge, where he caught a narrow outcropping with his hands, dropped twenty meters, leaped to another handhold and once more went down, bouncing, leaping, grasping tiny ledges. He took the final forty meters in one jump, landing in a bent-knee roll which sent him plunging down the slip-face of a dune in a shower of sand and dust. At the bottom he scrambled to his feet, launched himself to the next dunecrest in one jump. He could hear hoarse shouts from atop the cliff but ignored them to concentrate on the leaping strides from dunetop to dunetop. As he grew more accustomed to amplified muscles he found a sensuous joy that he had not anticipated in this distance-gulping movement. It was a ballet on the desert, defiance of the Tanzerouft which no other had ever experienced. When he judged that the ornithopter\u0027s occupants had overcome their shock enough to mount pursuit once more, he dove for the moon-shadowed face of a dune, burrowed into it. The sand was like heavy liquid to his new strength, but the temperature mounted dangerously when he moved too fast. He broke free on the far face of the dune, found that the membrane had covered his nostrils. He removed it, sensed the new skin pulsing over his body in its labor to absorb his perspiration. Leto fashioned a tube at his mouth, drank the syrup while he peered upward at the starry sky. He estimated he had come fifteen kilometers from Shuloch. Presently a \u0027thopter drew its pattern across the stars, a great bird shape followed by another and another. He heard the soft swishing of their wings, the whisper of their muted jets. Sipping at the living tube, he waited. First Moon passed through its track, then Second Moon. An hour before dawn Leto crept out and up to the dunecrest, examined the sky. No hunters. Now he knew himself to be embarked upon a path of no return. Ahead lay the trap in Time and Space which had been prepared as an unforgettable lesson for himself and all of mankind. Leto turned northeast and loped another fifty kilometers before burrowing into the sand for the day, leaving only a tiny hole to the surface which he kept open with a sandtrout tube. The membrane was learning how to live with him as he learned how to live with it. He tried not to think of the other things it was doing to his flesh. Tomorrow I\u0027ll raid Gara Rulen, he thought. I\u0027ll smash their qanat and loose its water into the sand. Then I\u0027ll go on to Windsack, Old Gap, and Harg. In a month the ecological transformation will have been set back a full generation. That\u0027ll give us space to develop the new timetable. And the wildness of the rebel tribes would be blamed, of course. Some would revive memories of Jacurutu. Alia would have her hands full. As for Ghanima... Silently to himself, Leto mouthed the words which would restore her memory. Time for that later... if they survived this terrible mixing of threads. The Golden Path lured him out there on the desert, almost a physical thing which he could see with his open eyes. And he thought how it was: as animals must move across the land, their existence dependent upon that movement the soul of humankind, blocked for eons, needed a track upon which it could move. He thought of his father then, telling himself: \"Soon we\u0027ll dispute as man to man, and only one vision will emerge.\" Limits of survival are set by climate, those long drifts of change which a generation may fail to notice. And it is the extremes of climate which set the pattern. Lonely, finite humans may observe climatic provinces, fluctuations of annual weather and, occasionally may observe such things as \"This is a colder year than I\u0027ve ever known. \" Such things are sensible. But humans are seldom alerted to the shifting average through a great span of years. And it is precisely in this alerting that humans learn how to survive on any planet. They must learn climate. -Arrakis, the Transformation, After Harq al-Ada Alia sat cross-legged on her bed, trying to compose herself by reciting the Litany Against Fear, but chuckling derision echoed in her skull to block every effort. She could hear the voice; it controlled her ears, her mind. \"What nonsense is this? What have you to fear?\" The muscles of her calves twitched as her feet tried to make running motions. There was nowhere to run. She wore only a golden gown of the sheerest Palian silk and it revealed the plumpness which had begun to bulge her body. The Hour of Assassins had just passed; dawn was near. Reports covering the past three months lay before her on the red coverlet. She could hear the humming of the air conditioner and a small breeze stirred the labels on the shigawire spools. Aides had awakened her fearfully two hours earlier, bringing news of the latest outrage, and Alia had called for the report spools, seeking an intelligible pattern. She gave up on the Litany. These attacks had to be the work of rebels. Obviously. More and more of them turned against Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s religion. \"And what\u0027s wrong with that?\" the derisive voice asked within her. Alia shook her head savagely. Namri had failed her. She\u0027d been a fool to trust such a dangerous double instrument. Her aides whispered that Stilgar was to blame, that he was a secret rebel. And what had become of Halleck? Gone to ground among his smuggler friends? Possibly. She picked up one of the report spools. And Muriz! The man was hysterical. That was the only possible explanation. Otherwise she\u0027d have to believe in miracles. No human, let alone a child (even a child such as Leto) could leap from the butte at Shuloch and survive to flee across the desert in leaps that took him from dunecrest to dunecrest. Alia felt the coldness of the shigawire under her hand. Where was Leto, then? Ghanima refused to believe him other than dead. A Truthsayer had confirmed her story: Leto slain by a Laza tiger. Then who was the child reported by Namri and Muriz? She shuddered. Forty qanats had been breached, their waters loosed into the sand. The loyal Fremen and even the rebels, superstitious louts, all! Her reports were flooded with stories of mysterious occurrences. Sandtrout leaped into qanats and shattered to become hosts of small replicas. Worms deliberately drowned themselves. Blood dripped from Second Moon and fell to Arrakis, where it stirred up great storms. And the storm frequency was increasing! She thought of Duncan incommunicado at Tabr, fretting under the restraints she\u0027d exacted from Stilgar. He and Irulan talked of little else than the real meaning behind these omens. Fools! Even her spies betrayed the influence of these outrageous stories! Why did Ghanima insist on her story of the Laza tiger? Alia sighed. Only one of the reports on the shigawire spools reassured her. Farad\u0027n had sent a contingent of his household guard \"to help you in troubles and to prepare the way for the Official Rite of Betrothal.\" Alia smiled to herself and shared the chuckle which rumbled in her skull. That plan, at least, remained intact. Logical explanations would be found to dispel all of this other superstitious nonsense. Meanwhile she\u0027d use Farad\u0027n\u0027s men to help close down Shuloch and to arrest the known dissidents, especially among the Naibs. She debated moving against Stilgar, but the inner voice cautioned against this. \"Not yet.\" \"My mother and the Sisterhood still have some plan of their own,\" Alia whispered. \"Why is she training Farad\u0027n?\" \"Perhaps he excites her,\" the Old Baron said. \"Not that cold one.\" \"You\u0027re not thinking of asking Farad\u0027n to return her?\" \"I know the dangers in that!\" \"Good. Meanwhile, that young aide Zia recently brought in. I believe his name\u0027s Agarves - Buer Agarves. If you\u0027d invite him here tonight...\" \"No!\" \"Alia...\" \"It\u0027s almost dawn, you insatiable old fool! There\u0027s a Military Council meeting this morning, the Priests will have -\" \"Don\u0027t trust them, darling Alia.\" \"Of course not!\" \"Very well. Now, this Buer Agarves...\" \"I said no!\" The Old Baron remained silent within her, but she began to feel a headache. A slow pain crept upward from her left cheek into her skull. Once he\u0027d sent her raging down the corridors with this trick. Now, she resolved to resist him. \"If you persist, I\u0027ll take a sedative,\" she said. He could see she meant it. The headache began to recede. \"Very well.\" Petulant. \"Another time, then.\" \"Another time,\" she agreed. Thou didst divide the sand by thy strength; Thou breakest the heads of the dragons in the desert. Yea, I behold thee as a beast coming up from the dunes; thou hast the two horns of the lamb, but thou speakest as the dragon. -Revised Orange Catholic Bible Arran 11:4 It was the immutable prophecy, the threads become rope, a thing Leto now seemed to have known all of his life. He looked out across the evening shadows on the Tanzerouft. One hundred and seventy kilometers due north lay Old Gap, the deep and twisting crevasse through the Shield Wall by which the first Fremen had migrated into the desert. No doubts remained in Leto. He knew why he stood here alone in the desert, yet filled with a sense that he owned this entire land, that it must do his bidding. He felt the chord which connected him with all of humankind and that profound need for a universe of experiences which made logical sense, a universe of recognizable regularities within its perpetual changes. I know this universe. The worm which had brought him here had come to the stamping of his foot and, rising up in front of him, had stopped like an obedient beast. He\u0027d leaped atop it and, with only his membrane-amplified hands, had exposed the leading lip of the worm\u0027s rings to keep it on the surface. The worm had exhausted itself in the nightlong dash northward. Its silicon-sulfur internal \"factory\" had worked at capacity, exhaling lavish gusts of oxygen which a following wind had sent in enveloping eddies around Leto. At times the warm gusts had made him dizzy, filled his mind with strange perceptions. The reflexive and circular subjectivity of his visions had turned inward upon his ancestry, forcing him to relive portions of his Terranic past, then comparing those portions with his changing self. Already he could feel how far he\u0027d drifted from something recognizably human. Seduced by the spice which he gulped from every trace he found, the membrane which covered him no longer was sandtrout, just as he was no longer human. Cilia had crept into his flesh, forming a new creature which would seek its own metamorphosis in the eons ahead. You saw this, father, and rejected it, he thought. It was a thing too terrible to face. Leto knew what was believed of his father, and why. Muad\u0027Dib died of prescience. But Paul Atreides had passed from the universe of reality into the alam al-mythal while still alive, fleeing from this thing which his son had dared. Now there was only The Preacher. Leto squatted on the sand and kept his attention northward. The worm would come from that direction, and on its back would ride two people: a young Fremen and a blind man. A flight of pallid bats passed over Leto\u0027s head, bending their course southeast. They were random specks in the darkening sky, and a knowledgeable Fremen eye could mark their back-course to learn where shelter lay that way. The Preacher would avoid that shelter, though. His destination was Shuloch, where no wild bats were permitted lest they guide strangers to a secret place. The worm appeared first as a dark movement between the desert and the northern sky. Matar, the rain of sand dropped from high altitudes by a dying stormwind, obscured the view for a few minutes, then it returned clearer and closer. The cold-line at the base of the dune where Leto crouched began to produce its nightly moisture. He tasted the fragile dampness in his nostrils, adjusted the bubble cap of the membrane over his mouth. There no longer was any need for him to find soaks and sip-wells. From his mother\u0027s genes he had that longer, larger Fremen large intestine to take back water from everything which came its way. The living stillsuit grasped and retained every bit of moisture it encountered. And even while he sat here the membrane which touched sand extruded pseudopod-cilia to hunt for bits of energy which it could store. Leto studied the approaching worm. He knew the youthful guide had seen him by this time, noting the spot atop the dune. The worm rider would discern no principle in this object seen from a distance, but that was a problem Fremen had learned how to handle. Any unknown object was dangerous. The young guide\u0027s reactions would be quite predictable, even without the vision. True to that prediction, the worm\u0027s course shifted slightly and aimed directly at Leto. Giant worms were a weapon which Fremen had employed many times. Worms had helped beat Shaddam at Arrakeen. This worm, however, failed to do its rider\u0027s bidding. It came to a halt ten meters away and no manner of goading would send it across another grain of sand. Leto arose, feeling the cilia snap back into the membrane behind him. He freed his mouth and called out: \"Achlan, wasachlan!\" Welcome, twice welcome! The blind man stood behind his guide atop the worm, one hand on the youth\u0027s shoulder. The man held his face high, nose pointed over Leto\u0027s head as though trying to sniff out this interruption. Sunset painted orange on his forehead. \"Who is that?\" the blind man asked, shaking his guide\u0027s shoulder. \"Why have we stopped?\" His voice was nasal through the stillsuit plugs. The youth stared fearfully down at Leto, said: \"It is only someone alone in the desert. A child by his looks. I tried to send the worm over him, but the worm won\u0027t go.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you say?\" the blind man demanded. \"I thought it was only someone alone in the desert!\" the youth protested. \"But it\u0027s a demon.\" \"Spoken like a true son of Jacurutu,\" Leto said. \"And you, sire, you are The Preacher.\" \"I am that one, yes.\" And there was fear in The Preacher\u0027s voice because, at last, he had met his own past. \"This is no garden,\" Leto said, \"but you are welcome to share this place with me tonight.\" \"Who are you?\" The Preacher demanded. \"How have you stopped our worm?\" There was an ominous tone of recognition in The Preacher\u0027s voice. Now he called up the memories of this alternate vision... knowing he could reach an end here. \"It\u0027s a demon!\" the young guide protested. \"We must flee this place or our souls -\" \"Silence!\" The Preacher roared. \"I am Leto Atreides,\" Leto said. \"Your worm stopped because I commanded it.\" The Preacher stood in frozen silence. \"Come, father,\" Leto said. \"Alight and spend the night with me. I\u0027ll give you sweet syrup to sip. I see you\u0027ve Fremkits with food and water jars. We\u0027ll share our riches here upon the sand.\" \"Leto\u0027s yet a child,\" The Preacher protested. \"And they say he\u0027s dead of Corrino treachery. There\u0027s no childhood in your voice.\" \"You know me, sire,\" Leto said. \"I\u0027m small for my age as you were, but my experience is ancient and my voice has learned.\" \"What do you here in the Inner Desert?\" The Preacher asked. \"Bu ji,\" Leto said. Nothing from nothing. It was the answer of a Zensunni wanderer, one who acted only from a position of rest, without effort and in harmony with his surroundings. The Preacher shook his guide\u0027s shoulder. \"Is it a child, truly a child?\" \"Aiya,\" the youth said, keeping a fearful attention on Leto. A great shuddering sigh shook The Preacher. \"No,\" he said. \"It is a demon in child form,\" the guide said. \"You will spend the night here,\" Leto said. \"We will do as he says,\" The Preacher said. He released his grip on the guide, slipped off the worm\u0027s side and slid down a ring to the sand, leaping clear when his feet touched. Turning, he said: \"Take the worm off and send it back into the sand. It is tired and will not bother us.\" \"The worm will not go!\" the youth protested. \"It will go,\" Leto said. \"But if you try to flee on it, I\u0027ll let it eat you.\" He moved to one side out of the worm\u0027s sensory range, pointed in the direction they had come. \"Go that way.\" The youth tapped a goad against the ring behind him, wiggled a hook where it held a ring open. Slowly the worm began to slide over the sand, turning as the youth shifted his hook down a side. The Preacher, following the sound of Leto\u0027s voice, clambered up the duneslope and stood two paces away. It was done with a swift sureness which told Leto this would be no easy contest. Here the visions parted. Leto said: \"Remove your suit mask, father.\" The Preacher obeyed, dropping the fold of his hood and withdrawing the mouth cover. Knowing his own appearance, Leto studied this face, seeing the lines of likeness as though they\u0027d been outlined in light. The lines formed an indefinable reconciliation, a pathway of genes without sharp boundaries, and there was no mistaking them. Those lines came down to Leto from the humming days, from the water-dripping days, from the miracle seas of Caladan. But now they stood at a dividing point on Arrakis as night waited to fold itself into the dunes. \"So father,\" Leto said glancing to the left where he could see the youthful guide trudging back to them from where the worm had been abandoned. \"Mu zein! \"\u0027The Preacher said, waving his right hand in a cutting gesture. This is no good! \"Koolish zein,\" Leto said, voice soft. This is all the good we may ever have. And he added, speaking in Chakobsa, the Atreides battle language: \"Here I am; here I remain! We cannot forget that, father.\" The Preacher\u0027s shoulders sagged. He put both hands to his empty sockets in a long-unused gesture. \"I gave you the sight of my eyes once and took your memories,\" Leto said. \"I know your decisions and I\u0027ve been to that place where you hid yourself.\" \"I know.\" The Preacher lowered his hands. \"You will remain?\" \"You named me for the man who put that on his coat of arms,\" Leto said. \"J\u0027y suis, j\u0027y reste!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-27.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
