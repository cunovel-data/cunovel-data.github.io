Our grandmother could be the instrument.\"\n \"There\u0027s another way,\" he said.\n \"Yes - the two of us... mated. But they know what recessives might complicate that pairing.\"\n \"It\u0027s a gamble they must\u0027ve discussed.\"\n \"And with our grandmother, at that. I don\u0027t like that way.\"\n \"Nor I.\"\n \"Still, it\u0027s not the first time a royal line has tried to...\"\n \"It repels me,\" he said, shuddering.\n She felt the movement, fell silent.\n \"Power,\" he said.\n And in that strange alchemy of their similarities she knew where his thoughts had been. \"The power of the Kwisatz Haderach must fail,\" she agreed.\n \"Used in their way,\" he said.\n In that instant, day came to the desert beyond their vantage point. They sensed the heat beginning. Colors leaped forth from the plantings beneath the cliff. Grey-green leaves sent spiked shadows along the ground. The low morning light of Dune\u0027s silvery sun revealed the verdant oasis full of golden and purple shadows in the well of the sheltering cliffs.\n Leto stood, stretched.\n \"The Golden Path, then,\" Ghanima said, and she spoke as much to herself as to him, knowing how their father\u0027s last vision met and melted into Leto\u0027s dreams.\n Something brushed against the moisture seals behind them and voices could be heard murmuring there.\n Leto reverted to the ancient language they used for privacy: \"L\u0027ii ani howr samis sm\u0027kwi owr samit sut.\"\n That was where the decision lodged itself in their awareness. Literally: We will accompany each other into deathliness, though only one may return to report it.\n Ghanima stood then and, together, they returned through the moisture seals to the sietch, where the guards roused themselves and fell in behind as the twins headed toward their own quarters. The throngs parted before them with a difference on this morning, exchanging glances with the guards. Spending the night alone above the desert was an old Fremen custom for the holy sages. All the Uma had practiced this form of vigil. Paul Muad\u0027Dib had done it... and Alia. Now the royal twins had begun.\n Leto noted the difference, mentioned it to Ghanima.\n \"They don\u0027t know what we\u0027ve decided for them,\" she said. \"They don\u0027t really know.\"\n Still in the private language, he said: \"It requires the most fortuitous beginning.\"\n Ghanima hesitated a moment to form her thoughts. Then: \"In that time, mourning for the sibling, it must be exactly real - even to the making of the tomb. The heart must follow the sleep lest there be no awakening.\"\n In the ancient tongue it was an extremely convoluted statement, employing a pronominal object separated from the infinitive. It was a syntax which allowed each set of internal phrases to turn upon itself, becoming several different meanings, all definite and quite distinct but subtly interrelated. In part, what she had said was that they risked death with Leto\u0027s plan and, real or simulated, it made no difference. The resultant change would be like death, literally: \"funeral murder.\" And there was an added meaning to the whole which pointed accusatively at whoever survived to report, that is: act out the living part. Any misstep there would negate the entire plan, and Leto\u0027s Golden Path would become a dead end.\n \"Extremely delicate,\" Leto agreed. He parted the hangings for them as they entered their own anteroom.\n Activity among their attendants paused only for a heartbeat as the twins crossed to the arched passage which led into the quarters assigned to the Lady Jessica.\n \"You are not Osiris.\" Ghanima reminded him.\n \"Nor will I try to be.\"\n Ghanima took his arm to stop him. \"Alia darsatay haunus m\u0027smow,\" she warned.\n Leto stared into his sister\u0027s eyes. Indeed, Alia\u0027s actions did give off a foul smell which their grandmother must have noted. He smiled appreciatively at Ghanima. She had mixed the ancient tongue with Fremen superstition to call up a most basic tribal omen. M\u0027smow, the foul odor of a summer night, was the harbinger of death at the hands of demons. And Isis had been the demon-goddess of death to the people whose tongue they now spoke.\n \"We Atreides have a reputation for audacity to maintain,\" he said.\n \"So we\u0027ll take what we need,\" she said.\n \"It\u0027s that or become petitioners before our own Regency,\" he said. \"Alia would enjoy that.\"\n \"But our plan...\" She let it trail off.\n Our plan, he thought. She shared it completely now. He said: \"I think of our plan as the toil of the shaduf.\"\n Ghanima glanced back at the anteroom through which they\u0027d passed, smelling the furry odors of morning with their sense of eternal beginning. She liked the way Leto had employed their private language. Toil of the shaduf. It was a pledge. He\u0027d called their plan agricultural work of a very menial kind: fertilizing, irrigating, weeding, transplanting, pruning - yet with the Fremen implication that this labor occurred simultaneously in Another World where it symbolized cultivating the richness of the soul.\n Ghanima studied her brother as they hesitated here in the rock passage. It had grown increasingly obvious to her that he was pleading on two levels: one, for the Golden Path of his vision and their father\u0027s, and two, that she allow him free reign to carry out the extremely dangerous myth-creation which the plan generated. This frightened her. Was there more to his private vision that he had not shared? Could he see himself as the potentially deified figure to lead humankind into a rebirth - like father, like son? The cult of Muad\u0027Dib had turned sour, fermenting in Alia\u0027s mismanagement and the unbridled license of a military priesthood which rode the Fremen power. Leto wanted regeneration.\n He\u0027s hiding something from me, she realized.\n She reviewed what he had told her of his dream. It held such iridescent reality that he might walk around for hours afterward in a daze. The dream never varied, he said.\n \"I am on sand in bright yellow daylight, yet there is no sun. Then I realize that I am the sun. My light shines out as a Golden Path. When I realize this, I move out of myself. I turn, expecting to see myself as the sun. But I am not the sun; I am a stick figure, a child\u0027s drawing with zigzag lightning lines for eyes, stick legs and stick arms. There is a scepter in my left hand, and it\u0027s a real scepter - much more detailed in its reality than the stick figure which holds it. The scepter moves, and this terrifies me. As it moves, I feel myself awaken, yet I know I\u0027m still dreaming. I realize then that my skin is encased in something - an armor which moves as my skin moves. I cannot see this armor, but I feel it. My terror leaves me then, for this armor gives me the strength of ten thousand men.\"\n As Ghanima stared at him, Leto tried to pull away, to continue their course toward Jessica\u0027s quarters. Ghanima resisted.\n \"This Golden Path could be no better than any other path,\" she said.\n Leto looked at the rock floor between them, feeling the strong return of Ghanima\u0027s doubts. \"I must do it,\" he said.\n \"Alia is possessed,\" she said. \"That could happen to us. It could already have happened and we might not know it.\"\n \"No.\" He shook his head, met her gaze. \"Alia resisted. That gave the powers within her their strength. By her own strength she was overcome. We\u0027ve dared to search within, to seek out the old languages and the old knowledge. We\u0027re already amalgams of those lives within us. We don\u0027t resist; we ride with them. This was what I learned from our father last night. It\u0027s what I had to learn.\"\n \"He said nothing of that within me.\"\n \"You listened to our mother. It\u0027s what we -\"\n \"And I almost lost.\"\n \"Is she still strong within you?\" Fear tightened his face.\n \"Yes... but now I think she guards me with her love. You were very good when you argued with her.\" And Ghanima thought about the reflected mother-within, said: \"Our mother exists now for me in the alam al-mythal with the others, but she has tasted the fruit of hell. Now I can listen to her without fear. As to the others...\"\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"And I listened to my father, but I think I\u0027m really following the counsel of the grandfather for whom I was named. Perhaps the name makes it easy.\"\n \"Are you counseled to speak to our grandmother of the Golden Path?\"\n Leto waited while an attendant pressed past them with a basket-tray carrying the Lady Jessica\u0027s breakfast. A strong smell of spice filled the air as the attendant passed.\n \"She lives in us and in her own flesh,\" Leto said. \"Her counsel can be consulted twice.\"\n \"Not by me,\" Ghanima protested. \"I\u0027m not risking that again.\"\n \"Then by me.\"\n \"I thought we agreed that she\u0027s gone back to the Sisterhood.\"\n \"Indeed. Bene Gesserit at her beginning, her own creature in the middle, and Bene Gesserit at the end. But remember that she, too, carries Harkonnen blood and is closer to it than we are, that she has experienced a form of this inner sharing which we have.\"\n \"A very shallow form,\" Ghanima said. \"And you haven\u0027t answered my question.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll mention the Golden Path.\"\n \"I may.\"\n \"Ghani!\"\n \"We don\u0027t need any more Atreides gods! We need a space for some humanity!\"\n \"Have I ever denied it?\"\n \"No.\" She took a deep breath and looked away from him. Attendants peered in at them from the anteroom, hearing the argument by its tone but unable to understand the ancient words.\n \"We have to do it,\" he said. \"If we fail to act, we might just as well fall upon our knives.\" He used the Fremen form which carried the meaning of \"spill our water into the tribal cistern.\"\n Once more Ghanima looked at him. She was forced to agree. But she felt trapped within a construction of many walls. They both knew a day of reckoning lay across their path no matter what they did. Ghanima knew this with a certainty reinforced by the data garnered from those other memory-lives, but now she feared the strength which she gave those other psyches by using the data of their experiences. They lurked like harpies within her, shadow demons waiting in ambush.\n Except for her mother, who had held the fleshly power and had renounced it. Ghanima still felt shaken by that inner struggle, knowing she would have lost but for Leto\u0027s persuasiveness.\n Leto said his Golden Path led out of this trap. Except for the nagging realization that he withheld something from his vision, she could only accept his sincerity. He needed her fertile creativity to enrich the plan.\n \"We\u0027ll be tested,\" he said, knowing where her doubts led.\n \"Not in the spice.\"\n \"Perhaps even there. Surely, in the desert and in the Trial of Possession.\"\n \"You never mentioned the Trial of Possession!\" she accused. \"Is that part of your dream?\"\n He tried to swallow in a dry throat, cursed this betrayal \"Yes.\"\n \"Then we will be... possessed?\"\n \"No.\"\n She thought about the Trial - that ancient Fremen examination whose ending most often brought hideous death. Then this plan had other complexities. It would take them onto an edge where a plunge to either side might not be countenanced by the human mind and that mind remain sane.\n Knowing where her thoughts meandered, Leto said: \"Power attracts the psychotics. Always. That\u0027s what we have to avoid within ourselves.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure we won\u0027t be... possessed?\"\n \"Not if we create the Golden Path.\"\n Still doubtful, she said: \"I\u0027ll not bear your children, Leto.\"\n He shook his head, suppressing the inner betrayals, lapsed into the royal-formal form of the ancient tongue: \"Sister mine, I love you more dearly than myself, but that is not the tender of my desires.\"\n \"Very well, then let us return to another argument before we join our grandmother. A knife slipped into Alia might settle most of our problems.\"\n \"If you believe that, you believe we can walk in mud and leave no tracks,\" he said. \"Besides, when has Alia ever given anyone an opportunity?\"\n \"There is talk about this Javid.\"\n \"Does Duncan show any signs of growing horns?\"\n Ghanima shrugged. \"One poison, two poison.\" It was the common label applied to the royal habit of cataloguing companions by their threat to your person, a mark of rulers everywhere.\n \"We must do it my way,\" he said.\n \"The other way might be cleaner.\"\n By her reply, he knew she had finally suppressed her doubts and come around to agreement with his plan. The realization brought him no happiness. He found himself looking at his own hands, wondering if the dirt would cling.\n This was Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s achievement: He saw the subliminal reservoir of each individual as an unconscious bank of memories going back to the primal cell of our common genesis. Each of us, he said, can measure out his distance from that common origin. Seeing this and telling of it, he made the audacious leap of decision. Muad\u0027Dib set himself the task of integrating genetic memory into ongoing evaluation. Thus did he break through Time\u0027s veils, making a single thing of the future and the past. That was Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s creation embodied in his son and his daughter. -Testament of Arrakis by Harq al-Ada\n Farad\u0027n strode through the garden compound of his grandfather\u0027s royal palace, watching his shadow grow shorter as the sun of Salusa Secundus climbed toward noon. He had to stretch himself a bit to keep step with the tall Bashar who accompanied him.\n \"I have doubts, Tyekanik,\" he said. \"Oh, there\u0027s no denying the attractions of a throne, but -\" He drew in a deep breath. \"- I have so many interests.\"\n Tyekanik, fresh from a savage argument with Farad\u0027n\u0027s mother, glanced sidelong at the Prince, noting how the lad\u0027s flesh was firming as he approached his eighteenth birthday. There was less and less of Wensicia in him with each passing day and more and more of old Shaddam, who had preferred his private pursuits to the responsibilities of royalty. That was what had cost him the throne in the end, of course. He\u0027d grown soft in the ways of command.\n \"You have to make a choice,\" Tyekanik said. \"Oh, doubtless there\u0027ll be time for some of your interests, but...\"\n Farad\u0027n chewed his lower lip. Duty held him here, but he felt frustrated. He would far rather have gone to the rock enclave where the sandtrout experiments were being conducted. Now there was a project with enormous potential: wrest the spice monopoly from the Atreides and anything might happen.\n \"You\u0027re sure these twins will be... eliminated?\"\n \"Nothing absolutely certain, My Prince, but the prospects are good.\"\n Farad\u0027n shrugged. Assassination remained a fact of royal life. The language was filled with the subtle permutations of ways to eliminate important personages. By a single word, one could distinguish between poison in drink or poison in food. He presumed the elimination of the Atreides twins would be accomplished by a poison. It was not a pleasant thought. By all accounts the twins were a most interesting pair.\n \"Would we have to move to Arrakis?\" Farad\u0027n asked.\n \"It\u0027s the best choice, put us at the point of greatest pressure.\" Farad\u0027n appeared to be avoiding some question and Tyekanik wondered what it might be.\n \"I\u0027m troubled, Tyekanik,\" Farad\u0027n said, speaking as they rounded a hedge corner and approached a fountain surrounded by giant black roses. Gardeners could be heard snipping beyond the hedges.\n \"Yes?\" Tyekanik prompted.\n \"This, ah, religion which you\u0027ve professed...\"\n \"Nothing strange about that, My Prince,\" Tyekanik said and hoped his voice remained firm. \"This religion speaks to the warrior in me. It\u0027s a fitting religion for a Sardaukar.\" That, at least, was true.\n \"Yesss... But my mother seems so pleased by it.\" Damn Wensicia! he thought. She\u0027s made her son suspicious.\n \"I care not what your mother thinks,\" Tyekanik said. \"A man\u0027s religion is his own affair. Perhaps she sees something in this that may help to put you on the throne.\"\n \"That was my thought,\" Farad\u0027n said.\n Ahhh, this is a sharp lad! Tyekanik thought. He said: \"Look into the religion for yourself; you\u0027ll see at once why I chose it.\"\n \"Still... Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s preachings? He was an Atreides, after all.\"\n \"I can only say that the ways of God are mysterious,\" Tyekanik said.\n \"I see. Tell me, Tyek, why\u0027d you ask me to walk with you just now? It\u0027s almost noon and usually you\u0027re off to someplace or other at my mother\u0027s command this time of day.\"\n Tyekanik stopped at a stone bench which looked upon the fountain and the giant roses beyond. The splashing water soothed him and he kept his attention upon it as he spoke. \"My Prince, I\u0027ve done something which your mother may not like.\" And he thought: If he believes that, her damnable scheme will work. Tyekanik almost hoped Wensicia\u0027s scheme would fail. Bringing that damnable Preacher here. She was insane. And the cost!\n As Tyekanik remained silent, waiting, Farad\u0027n asked: \"All right, Tyek, what\u0027ve you done?\"\n \"I\u0027ve brought a practitioner of oneiromancy,\" Tyekanik said.\n Farad\u0027n shot a sharp glance at his companion. Some of the older Sardaukar played the dream-interpretation game, had done so increasingly since their defeat by that \"Supreme Dreamer,\" Muad\u0027Dib. Somewhere within their dreams, they reasoned, might lay a way back to power and glory. But Tyekanik had always eschewed this play.\n \"This doesn\u0027t sound like you, Tyek,\" Farad\u0027n said.\n \"Then I can only speak from my new religion,\" he said, addressing the fountain. To speak of religion was, of course, why they\u0027d risked bringing The Preacher here.\n \"Then speak from this religion,\" Farad\u0027n said.\n \"As My Prince commands.\" He turned, looked at this youthful holder of all the dreams which now were distilled into the path which House Corrino would follow. \"Church and state. My Prince, even scientific reason and faith, and even more: progress and tradition - all of these are reconciled in the teachings of Muad\u0027Dib. He taught that there are no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men and, sometimes, in their dreams. One discovers the future in the past, and both are part of a whole.\"\n In spite of doubts which he could not dispel, Farad\u0027n found himself impressed by these words. He heard a note of reluctant sincerity in Tyekanik\u0027s voice, as though the man spoke against inner compulsions.\n \"And that\u0027s why you bring me this... this interpreter of dreams?\"\n \"Yes, My Prince. Perhaps your dream penetrates Time. You win back your consciousness of your inner being when you recognize the universe as a coherent whole. Your dreams... well...\"\n \"But I spoke idly of my dreams,\" Farad\u0027n protested. \"They are a curiosity, no more. I never once suspected that you...\"\n \"My Prince, nothing you do can be unimportant.\"\n \"That\u0027s very flattering, Tyek. Do you really believe this fellow can see into the heart of great mysteries?\"\n \"I do, My Prince.\"\n \"Then let my mother be displeased.\"\n \"You will see him?\"\n \"Of course - since you\u0027ve brought him to displease my mother.\"\n Does he mock me? Tyekanik wondered. And he said: \"I must warn you that the old man wears a mask. It is an Ixian device which enables the sightless to see with their skin.\"\n \"He is blind?\"\n \"Yes, My Prince.\"\n \"Does he know who I am?\"\n \"I told him, My Prince.\"\n \"Very well. Let us go to him.\"\n \"If My Prince will wait a moment here, I will bring the man to him.\"\n Farad\u0027n looked around the fountain garden, smiled. As good a place as any for this foolishness. \"Have you told him what I dreamed?\"\n \"Only in general terms, My Prince. He will ask you for a personal accounting.\"\n \"Oh, very well. I\u0027ll wait here. Bring the fellow.\"\n Farad\u0027n turned his back, heard Tyekanik retire in haste. A gardener could be seen working just beyond the hedge, the top of a brown-capped head, the flashing of shears poking above the greenery. The movement was hypnotic.\n This dream business is nonsense, Farad\u0027n thought. It was wrong of Tyek to do this without consulting me. Strange that Tyek should get religion at his age. And now it\u0027s dreams.\n Presently he heard footsteps behind him. Tyekanik\u0027s familiar positive stride and a more dragging gait. Farad\u0027n turned, stared at the approaching dream interpreter. The Ixian mask was a black, gauzy affair which concealed the face from the forehead to below the chin. There were no eye slits in the mask. If one were to believe the Ixian boasts, the entire mask was a single eye.\n Tyekanik stopped two paces from Farad\u0027n, but the masked old man approached to less than a pace.\n \"The interpreter of dreams,\" Tyekanik said.\n Farad\u0027n nodded.\n The masked old man coughed in a remote grunting fashion, as though trying to bring something up from his stomach. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-7.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) \n The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
