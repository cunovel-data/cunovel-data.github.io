{"id":97147,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Leto peered back over his shoulder at Ghanima. There was no surprise in him that she knew the song and its lyrics, but he felt a sudden onset of awe at the singleness of their twinned lives. One of them could die and yet remain alive in the other\u0027s consciousness, every shared memory intact; they were that close. He found himself frightened by the timeless web of that closeness, broke his gaze away from her. The web contained gaps, he knew. His fear arose from the newest of those gaps. He felt their lives beginning to separate and wondered: How can I tell her of this thing which has happened only to me? He peered out over the desert, seeing the deep shadows behind the barachans - those high, crescent-shaped migratory dunes which moved like waves around Arrakis. This was Kedem, the inner desert, and its dunes were rarely marked these days by the irregularities of a giant worm\u0027s progress. Sunset drew bloody streaks over the dunes, imparting a fiery light to the shadow edges. A hawk falling from the crimson sky captured his awareness as it captured a rock partridge in flight. Directly beneath him on the desert floor plants grew in a profusion of greens, watered by a qanat which flowed partly in the open, partly in covered tunnels. The water came from giant windtrap collectors behind him on the highest point of rock. The green flag of the Atreides flew openly there. Water and green. The new symbols of Arrakis: water and green. A diamond-shaped oasis of planted dunes spread beneath his high perch, focusing his attention into sharp Fremen awareness. The bell call of a nightbird came from the cliff below him, and it amplified the sensation that he lived this moment out of a wild past. Nous avons change tout cela, he thought, falling easily into one of the ancient tongues which he and Ghanima employed in private. \"We have altered all of that.\" He sighed. Oublier je ne puis. \"I cannot forget.\" Beyond the oasis, he could see in this failing light the land Fremen called \"The Emptiness\" - the land where nothing grows, the land never fertile. Water and the great ecological plan were changing that. There were places now on Arrakis where one could see the plush green velvet of forested hills. Forests on Arrakis! Some in the new generation found it difficult to imagine dunes beneath those undulant green hills. To such young eyes there was no shock value in seeing the flat foliage of rain trees. But Leto found himself thinking now in the Old Fremen manner, wary of change, fearful in the presence of the new. He said: \"The children tell me they seldom find sandtrout here near the surface anymore.\" \"What\u0027s that supposed to indicate?\" Ghanima asked. There was petulance in her tone. \"Things are beginning to change very swiftly,\" he said. Again the bird chimed in the cliff, and night fell upon the desert as the hawk had fallen upon the partridge. Night often subjected him to an assault of memories - all of those inner lives clamoring for their moment. Ghanima didn\u0027t object to this phenomenon in quite the way he did. She knew his disquiet, though, and he felt her hand touch his shoulder in sympathy. He struck an angry chord from the baliset. How could he tell her what was happening to him? Within his head were wars, uncounted lives parceling out their ancient memories: violent accidents, love\u0027s languor, the colors of many places and many faces... the buried sorrows and leaping joys of multitudes. He heard elegies to springs on planets which no longer existed, green dances and firelight, wails and halloos, a harvest of conversations without number. Their assault was hardest to bear at nightfall in the open. \"Shouldn\u0027t we be going in?\" she asked. He shook his head, and she felt the movement, realizing at last that his troubles went deeper than she had suspected. Why do I so often greet the night out here? he asked himself. He did not feel Ghanima withdraw her hand. \"You know why you torment yourself this way,\" she said. He heard the gentle chiding in her voice. Yes, he knew. The answer lay there in his awareness, obvious: Because that great known-unknown within moves me like a wave. He felt the cresting of his past as though he rode a surfboard. He had his father\u0027s time-spread memories of prescience superimposed upon everything else, yet he wanted all of those pasts. He wanted them. And they were so very dangerous. He knew that completely now with this new thing which he would have to tell Ghanima. The desert was beginning to glow under the rising light of First Moon. He stared out at the false immobility of sand furls reaching into infinity. To his left, in the near distance, lay The Attendant, a rock outcropping which sandblast winds had reduced to a low, sinuous shape like a dark worm striking through the dunes. Someday the rock beneath him would be cut down to such a shape and Sietch Tabr would be no more, except in the memories of someone like himself. He did not doubt that there would be someone like himself. \"Why\u0027re you staring at The Attendant?\" Ghanima asked. He shrugged. In defiance of their guardians\u0027 orders, he and Ghanima often went to The Attendant. They had discovered a secret hiding place there, and Leto knew now why that place lured them. Beneath him, its distance foreshortened by darkness, an open stretch of qanat gleamed in moonlight; its surface rippled with movements of predator fish which Fremen always planted in their stored water to keep out the sandtrout. \"I stand between fish and worm,\" he murmured. \"What?\" He repeated it louder. She put a hand to her mouth, beginning to suspect the thing which moved him. Her father had acted thus; she had but to peer inward and compare. Leto shuddered. Memories which fastened him to places his flesh had never known presented him with answers to questions he had not asked. He saw relationships and unfolding events against a gigantic inner screen. The sandworm of Dune would not cross water; water poisoned it. Yet water had been known here in prehistoric times. White gypsum pans attested to bygone lakes and seas. Wells, deep-drilled, found water which sandtrout sealed off. As clearly as if he\u0027d witnessed the events, he saw what had happened on this planet and it filled him with foreboding for the cataclysmic changes which human intervention was bringing. His voice barely above a whisper, he said: \"I know what happened, Ghanima.\" She bent close to him. \"Yes?\" \"The sandtrout...\" He fell silent and she wondered why he kept referring to the haploid phase of the planet\u0027s giant sandworm, but she dared not prod him. \"The sandtrout,\" he repeated, \"was introduced here from some other place. This was a wet planet then. They proliferated beyond the capability of existing ecosystems to deal with them. Sandtrout encysted the available free water, made this a desert planet... and they did it to survive. In a planet sufficiently dry, they could move to their sandworm phase.\" \"The sandtrout?\" She shook her head, not doubting him, but unwilling to search those depths where he gathered such information. And she thought: Sandtrout? Many times in this flesh and other had she played the childhood game, poling for sandtrout, teasing them into a thin glove membrane before taking them to the deathstill for their water. It was difficult to think of this mindless little creature as a shaper of enormous events. Leto nodded to himself. Fremen had always known to plant predator fish in their water cisterns. The haploid sandtrout actively resisted great accumulations of water near the planet\u0027s surface; predators swam in that qanat below him. Their sandworm vector could handle small amounts of water - the amounts held in cellular bondage by human flesh, for example. But confronted by large bodies of water, their chemical factories went wild, exploded in the death-transformation which produced the dangerous melange concentrate, the ultimate awareness drug employed in a diluted fraction for the sietch orgy. That pure concentrate had taken Paul Muad\u0027Dib through the walls of Time, deep into the well of dissolution which no other male had ever dared. Ghanima sensed her brother trembling where he sat in front of her. \"What have you done?\" she demanded. But he would not leave his own train of revelation. \"Fewer sandtrout - the ecological transformation of the planet...\" \"They resist it, of course,\" she said, and now she began to understand the fear in his voice, drawn into this thing against her will. \"When the sandtrout go, so do all the worms,\" he said. \"The tribes must be warned.\" \"No more spice,\" she said. Words merely touched high points of the system danger which they both saw hanging over human intrusion into Dune\u0027s ancient relationships. \"It\u0027s the thing Alia knows,\" he said. \"It\u0027s why she gloats.\" \"How can you be sure of that?\" \"I\u0027m sure.\" Now she knew for certain what disturbed him, and she felt the knowledge chill her. \"The tribes won\u0027t believe us if she denies it,\" he said. His statement went to the primary problem of their existence: What Fremen expected wisdom from a nine-year-old? Alia, growing farther and farther from her own inner sharing each day, played upon this. \"We must convince Stilgar,\" Ghanima said. As one, their heads turned and they stared out over the moonlit desert. It was a different place now, changed by just a few moments of awareness. Human interplay with that environment had never been more apparent to them. They felt themselves as integral parts of a dynamic system held in delicately balanced order. The new outlook involved a real change of consciousness which flooded them with observations. As Liet-Kynes had said, the universe was a place of constant conversation between animal populations. The haploid sandtrout had spoken to them as human animals. \"The tribes would understand a threat to water,\" Leto said. \"But it\u0027s a threat to more than water. It\u0027s a -\" She fell silent, understanding the deeper meaning of his words. Water was the ultimate power symbol on Arrakis. At their roots Fremen remained special-application animals, desert survivors, governance experts under conditions of stress. And as water became plentiful, a strange symbol transfer came over them even while they understood the old necessities. \"You mean a threat to power,\" she corrected him. \"Of course.\" \"But will they believe us?\" \"If they see it happening, if they see the imbalance.\" \"Balance,\" she said, and repeated her father\u0027s words from long ago: \"It\u0027s what distinguishes a people from a mob.\" Her words called up their father in him and he said: \"Economics versus beauty - a story older than Sheba.\" He sighed, looked over his shoulder at her. \"I\u0027m beginning to have prescient dreams, Ghani.\" A sharp gasp escaped her. He said: \"When Stilgar told us our grandmother was delayed - I already knew that moment. Now my other dreams are suspect.\" \"Leto...\" She shook her head, eyes damp. \"It came later for our father. Don\u0027t you think it might be -\" \"I\u0027ve dreamed myself enclosed in armor and racing across the dunes,\" he said. \"And I\u0027ve been to Jacurutu.\" \"Jacu...\" She cleared her throat. \"That old myth!\" \"A real place. Ghani! I must find this man they call The Preacher. I must find him and question him.\" \"You think he\u0027s... our father?\" \"Ask yourself that question.\" \"It\u0027d be just like him,\" she agreed, \"but...\" \"I don\u0027t like the things I know I\u0027ll do,\" he said. \"For the first time in my life I understand my father.\" She felt excluded from his thoughts, said: \"The Preacher\u0027s probably just an old mystic.\" \"I pray for that,\" he whispered. \"Oh, how I pray for that!\" He rocked forward, got to his feet. The baliset hummed in his hand as he moved. \"Would that he were only Gabriel without a horn.\" He stared silently at the moonlit desert. She turned to look where he looked, saw the foxfire glow of rotting vegetation at the edge of the sietch plantings, then the clean blending into lines of dunes. That was a living place out there. Even when the desert slept, something remained awake in it. She sensed that wakefulness, hearing animals below her drinking at the qanat. Leto\u0027s revelation had transformed the night: this was a living moment, a time to discover regularities within perpetual change, an instant in which to feel that long movement from their Terranic past, all of it encapsulated in her memories. \"Why Jacurutu?\" she asked, and the flatness of her tone shattered the mood. \"Why... I don\u0027t know. When Stilgar first told us how they killed the people there and made the place tabu, I thought... what you thought. But danger comes from there now... and The Preacher.\" She didn\u0027t respond, didn\u0027t demand that he share more of his prescient dreams with her, and she knew how much this told him of her terror. That way led to Abomination and they both knew it. The word hung unspoken between them as he turned and led the way back over the rocks to the sietch entrance. Abomination. The Universe is God\u0027s. It is one thing, a wholeness against which all separations may be identified. Transient life, even that self-aware and reasoning life which we call sentient, holds only fragile trusteeship on any portion of the wholeness. -Commentaries from the C.E.T. (Commission of Ecumenical Translators) Halleck used hand signals to convey the actual message while speaking aloud of other matters. He didn\u0027t like the small anteroom the priests had assigned for this report, knowing it would be crawling with spy devices. Let them try to break the tiny hand signals, though. The Atreides had used this means of communication for centuries without anyone the wiser. Night had fallen outside, but the room had no windows, depending upon glowglobes at the upper corners. \"Many of those we took were Alia\u0027s people,\" Halleck signaled, watching Jessica\u0027s face as he spoke aloud, telling her the interrogation still continued. \"It was as you anticipated then,\" Jessica replied, her fingers winking. She nodded and spoke an open reply: \"I\u0027ll expect a full report when you\u0027re satisfied, Gurney.\" \"Of course, My Lady,\" he said, and his fingers continued: \"There is another thing, quite disturbing. Under the deep drugs, some of our captives talked of Jacurutu and, as they spoke the name, they died.\" \"A conditioned heart-stopper?\" Jessica\u0027s fingers asked. And she said: \"Have you released any of the captives?\" \"A few, My Lady - the more obvious culls.\" And his fingers darted: \"We suspect a heart-compulsion but are not yet certain. The autopsies aren\u0027t completed. I thought you should know about this thing of Jacurutu, however, and came immediately.\" \"My Duke and I always thought Jacurutu an interesting legend probably based on fact,\" Jessica\u0027s fingers said, and she ignored the usual tug of sorrow as she spoke of her long-dead love. \"Do you have orders?\" Halleck asked, speaking aloud. Jessica answered in kind, telling him to return to the landing field and report when he had positive information, but her fingers conveyed another message: \"Resume contact with your friends among the smugglers. If Jacurutu exists, they\u0027ll support themselves by selling spice. There\u0027d be no other market for them except the smugglers.\" Halleck bowed his head briefly while his fingers said: \"I\u0027ve already set this course in motion, My Lady.\" And because he could not ignore the training of a lifetime, added: \"Be very careful in this place. Alia is your enemy and most of the priesthood belongs to her.\" \"Not Javid,\" Jessica\u0027s fingers responded. \"He hates the Atreides. I doubt anyone but an adept could detect it, but I\u0027m positive of it. He conspires and Alia doesn\u0027t know of it.\" \"I\u0027m assigning additional guards to your person,\" Halleck said, speaking aloud, avoiding the light spark of displeasure which Jessica\u0027s eyes betrayed. \"There are dangers, I\u0027m certain. Will you spend the night here?\" \"We\u0027ll go later to Sietch Tabr,\" she said and hesitated, on the point of telling him not to send more guards, but she held her silence. Gurney\u0027s instincts were to be trusted. More than one Atreides had learned this, both to his pleasure and his sorrow. \"I have one more meeting - with the Master of Novitiates this time,\" she said. \"That\u0027s the last one and I\u0027ll be happily shut of this place.\" And I beheld another beast coming up out of the sand; and he had two horns like a lamb, but his mouth was fanged and fiery as the dragon and his body shimmered and burned with great heat while it did hiss like the serpent. -Revised Orange Catholic Bible He called himself The Preacher, and there had come to be an awesome fear among many on Arrakis that he might be Muad\u0027Dib returned from the desert, not dead at all. Muad\u0027Dib could be alive; for who had seen his body? For that matter, who saw any body that the desert took? But still - Muad\u0027Dib? Points of comparison could be made, although no one from the old days came forward and said: \"Yes, I see that this is Muad\u0027Dib. I know him.\" Still... Like Muad\u0027Dib, The Preacher was blind, his eye sockets black and scarred in a way that could have been done by a stone burner. And his voice conveyed that crackling penetration, that same compelling force which demanded a response from deep within you. Many remarked this. He was lean, this Preacher, his leathery face seamed, his hair grizzled. But the deep desert did that to many people. You had only to look about you and see this proven. And there was another fact for contention: The Preacher was led by a young Fremen, a lad without known sietch who said, when questioned, that he worked for hire. It was argued that Muad\u0027Dib, knowing the future, had not needed such a guide except at the very end, when his grief overcame him. But he\u0027d needed a guide then; everyone knew it. The Preacher had appeared one winter morning in the streets of Arrakeen, a brown and ridge-veined hand on the shoulder of his young guide. The lad, who gave his name as Assan Tariq, moved through the flint-smelling dust of the early swarming, leading his charge with the practiced agility of the warren-born, never once losing contact. It was observed that the blind man wore a traditional bourka over a stillsuit which bore the mark about it of those once made only in the sietch caves of the deepest desert. It wasn\u0027t like the shabby suits being turned out these days. The nose tube, which captured moisture from his breath for the recycling layers beneath the bourka, was wrapped in braid, and it was the black vine braid so seldom seen anymore. The suit\u0027s mask across the lower half of his face carried green patches etched by the blown sand. All in all, this Preacher was a figure from Dune\u0027s past. Many among the early crowds of that winter day had noted his passage. After all, a blind Fremen remained a rarity. Fremen Law still consigned the blind to Shai-Hulud. The wording of the Law, although it was less honored in these modem, water-soft times, remained unchanged from the earliest days. The blind were a gift to Shai-Hulud. They were to be exposed in the open bled for the great worms to devour. When it was done - and there were stories which got back to the cities - it was always done out where the largest worms still ruled, those called Old Men of the Desert. A blind Fremen, then, was a curiosity, and people paused to watch the passing of this odd pair. The lad appeared about fourteen standard, one of the new breed who wore modified stillsuits; it left the face open to the moisture-robbing air. He had slender features, the all-blue spice-tinted eyes, a nubbin nose, and that innocuous look of innocence which so often masks cynical knowledge in the young. In contrast, the blind man was a reminder of times almost forgotten - long in stride and with a wiriness that spoke of many years on the sand with only his feet or a captive worm to carry him. He held his head in that stiff-necked rigidity which some of the blind cannot put off. The hooded head moved only when he cocked an ear at an interesting sound. Through the day\u0027s gathering crowds the strange pair came, arriving at last on the steps which led up like terraced hectares to the escarpment which was Alia\u0027s Temple, a fitting companion to Paul\u0027s Keep. Up the steps The Preacher went until he and his young guide came to the third landing, where pilgrims of the Hajj awaited the morning opening of those gigantic doors above them. They were doors large enough to have admitted an entire cathedral from one of the ancient religions. Passing through them was said to reduce a pilgrim\u0027s soul to motedom, sufficiently small that it could pass through the eye of a needle and enter heaven. At the edge of the third landing The Preacher turned, and it was as though he looked about him, seeing with his empty eye sockets the foppish city dwellers, some of them Fremen, with garments which simulated stillsuits but were only decorative fabrics, seeing the eager pilgrims fresh off the Guild space transports and awaiting that first step on the devotion which would ensure them a place in paradise. The landing was a noisy place: there were Mahdi Spirit Cultists in green robes and carrying live hawks trained to screech a \"call to heaven.\" Food was being sold by shouting vendors. Many things were being offered for sale, the voices shouting in competitive stridence: there was the Dune Tarot with its booklets of commentaries imprinted on shigawire. One vendor had exotic bits of cloth \"guaranteed to have been touched by Muad\u0027Dib himself!\" Another had vials of water \"certified to have come from Sietch Tabr, where Muad\u0027Dib lived.\" Through it all there were conversations in a hundred or more dialects of Galach interspersed with harsh gutturals and squeaks of outrine languages which were gathered under the Holy Imperium. Face dancers and little people from the suspected artisan planets of the Tleilaxu bounced and gyrated through the throng in bright clothing. There were lean faces and fat, water-rich faces. The susurration of nervous feet came from the gritty plasteel which formed the wide steps. And occasionally a keening voice would rise out of the cacophony in prayer - \"Mua-a-a-ad\u0027Dib! Mua-a-a-ad\u0027Dib! Greet my soul\u0027s entreaty! You, who are God\u0027s anointed, greet my soul! Mua-a-a-ad\u0027Dib!\" Nearby among the pilgrims, two mummers played for a few coins, reciting the lines of the currently popular \"Disputation of Armistead and Leandgrah.\" The Preacher cocked his head to listen. The Mummers were middle-aged city men with bored voices. At a word of command, the young guide described them for The Preacher. They were garbed in loose robes, not even deigning to simulate stillsuits on their water-rich bodies. Assan Tariq thought this amusing, but The Preacher reprimanded him. The mummer who played the part of Leandgrah was just concluding his oration: \"Bah! The universe can be grasped only by the sentient hand. That hand is what drives your precious brain, and it drives everything else that derives from the brain. You see what you have created, you become sentient, only after the hand has done its work!\" A scattering of applause greeted his performance. The Preacher sniffed and his nostrils recorded the rich odors of this place: uncapped esters of poorly adjusted stillsuits, masking musks of diverse origin, the common flinty dust, exhalations of uncounted exotic diets, and the aromas of rare incense which already had been ignited within Alia\u0027s Temple and now drifted down over the steps in cleverly directed currents. The Preacher\u0027s thoughts were mirrored on his face as he absorbed his surroundings: We have come to this, we Fremen! A sudden diversion rippled through the crowd on the landing. Sand Dancers had come into the plaza at the foot of the steps, half a hundred of them tethered to each other by elacca ropes. They obviously had been dancing thus for days, seeking a state of ecstasy. Foam dribbled from their mouths as they jerked and stamped to their secret music. A full third of them dangled unconscious from the ropes, tugged back and forth by the others like dolls on strings. One of these dolls had come awake, though, and the crowd apparently knew what to expect. \"I have see-ee-een!\" the newly awakened dancer shrieked. \"I have see-ee-een!\" He resisted the pull of the other dancers, darted his wild gaze right and left. \"Where this city is, there will be only sand! I have see-ee-een!\" A great swelling laugh went up from the onlookers. Even the new pilgrims joined it. This was too much for The Preacher. He raised both arms and roared in a voice which surely had commanded worm riders: \"Silence!\" The entire throng in the plaza went still at that battle cry. The Preacher pointed a thin hand toward the dancers, and the illusion that he actually saw them was uncanny. \"Did you not hear that man? Blasphemers and idolaters! All of you! The religion of Muad\u0027Dib is not Muad\u0027Dib. He spurns it as he spurns you! Sand will cover this place. Sand will cover you.\" Saying this, he dropped his arms, put a hand on his young guide\u0027s shoulder, and commanded: \"Take me from this place.\" Perhaps it was The Preacher\u0027s choice of words: He spurns it as he spurns you! Perhaps it was his tone, certainly something more than human, a vocality trained surely in the arts of the Bene Gesserit Voice which commanded by mere nuances of subtle inflection. Perhaps it was only the inherent mysticism of this place where Muad\u0027Dib had lived and walked and ruled. Someone called out from the landing, shouting at The Preacher\u0027s receding back in a voice which trembled with religious awe: \"Is that Muad\u0027Dib come back to us?\" The Preacher stopped, reached into the purse beneath his bourka, and removed an object which only those nearby recognized. It was a desert-mummified human hand, one of the planet\u0027s jokes on mortality which occasionally turned up in the sand and were universally regarded as communications from Shai-Hulud The hand had been desiccated into a tight fist which ended in white bone scarred by sandblast winds. \"I bring the Hand of God, and that is all I bring!\" The Preacher shouted. \"I speak for the Hand of God. I am The Preacher.\" Some took him to mean that the hand was Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s, but others fastened on that commanding presence and the terrible voice - and that was how Arrakis came to know his name. But it was not the last time his voice was heard. It is commonly reported, my dear Georad, that there exists great natural virtue in the melange experience. Perhaps this is true. There remain within me, however, profound doubts that every use of melange always brings virtue. Me seems that certain persons have corrupted the use of melange in defiance of God. In the words of the Ecumenon, they have disfigured the soul. They skim the surface of melange and believe thereby to attain grace. They deride their fellows, do great harm to godliness, and they distort the meaning of this abundant gift maliciously, surely a mutilation beyond the power of man to restore. To be truly at one with the virtue of the spice, uncorrupted in all ways, full of goodly honor, a man must permit his deeds and his words to agree. When your actions describe a system of evil consequences, you should be judged by those consequences and not by your explanations. It is thus that we should judge Muad\u0027Dib. -The Pedant Heresy It was a small room tinged with the odor of ozone and reduced to a shadowy greyness by dimmed glowglobes and the metallic blue light of a single transeye-monitoring screen. The screen was about a meter wide and only two-thirds of a meter in height. It revealed in remote detail a barren, rocky valley with two Laza tigers feeding on the bloody remnants of a recent kill. On the hillside above the tigers could be seen a slender man in Sardaukar working uniform, Levenbrech insignia at his collar. He wore a servo-control keyboard against his chest. One veriform suspensor chair faced the screen, occupied by a fair-haired woman of indeterminate age. She had a heart-shaped face and slender hands which gripped the chair arms as she watched. The fullness of a white robe trimmed in gold concealed her figure. A pace to her right stood a blocky man dressed in the bronze and gold uniform of a Bashar Aide in the old Imperial Sardaukar. His greying hair had been closely cropped over square, emotionless features. The woman coughed, said: \"It went as you predicted, Tyekanik.\" \"Assuredly, Princess,\" the Bashar Aide said, his voice hoarse. She smiled at the tension in his voice, asked: \"Tell me, Tyekanik, how will my son like the sound of Emperor Farad\u0027n I?\" \"The title suits him, Princess.\" \"That was not my question.\" \"He might not approve some of the things done to gain him that, ahh, title.\" \"Then again...\" She turned, peered up through the gloom at him. \"You served my father well. It was not your fault that he lost the throne to the Atreides. But surely the sting of that loss must be felt as keenly by you as by any -\" \"Does the Princess Wensicia have some special task for me?\" Tyekanik asked. His voice remained hoarse, but there was a sharp edge to it now. \"You have a bad habit of interrupting me,\" she said. Now he smiled, displaying thick teeth which glistened in the light from the screen. \"At times you remind me of your father,\" he said. \"Always these circumlocutions before a request for a delicate... ahh, assignment.\" She jerked her gaze away from him to conceal anger, asked: \"Do you really think those Lazas will put my son on the throne?\" \"It\u0027s distinctly possible, Princess. You must admit that the bastard get of Paul Atreides would be no more than juicy morsels for those two. And with those twins gone...\" He shrugged. \"The grandson of Shaddam IV becomes the logical successor,\" she said. \"That is if we can remove the objections of the Fremen, the Landsraad and CHOAM, not to mention any surviving Atreides who might -\" \"Javid assures me that his people can take care of Alia quite easily. I do not count the Lady Jessica as an Atreides. Who else remains?\" \"Landsraad and CHOAM will go where the profit goes,\" she said, \"but what of the Fremen?\" \"We\u0027ll drown them in their Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s religion!\" \"Easier said than done, my dear Tyekanik.\" \"I see,\" he said. \"We\u0027re back to that old argument.\" \"House Corrino has done worse things to gain power,\" she said. \"But to embrace this... this Mahdi\u0027s religion!\" \"My son respects you,\" she said. \"Princess, I long for the day when House Corrino returns to its rightful seat of power. So does every remaining Sardaukar here on Salusa. But if you -\" \"Tyekanik! This is the planet Salusa Secundus. Do not fall into the lazy ways which spread through our Imperium. Full name, complete title - attention to every detail. Those attributes will send the Atreides lifeblood into the sands of Arrakis. Every detail, Tyekanik!\" He knew what she was doing with this attack. It was part of the shifty trickiness she\u0027d learned from her sister, Irulan. But he felt himself losing ground. \"Do you hear me, Tyekanik?\" \"I hear, Princess.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-3.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
