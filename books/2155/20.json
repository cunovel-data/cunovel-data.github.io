{"id":97164,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Beneath the hill where the fox runs lightly,\n A dappled sun shines brightly\n Where my one love\u0027s still.\n Beneath the hill in the fennel brake\n I spy my love who cannot wake.\n He hides in a grave\n Beneath the hill.\n Where was the entrance to that place? Leto wondered.\n He felt the certainty that this must be Jacurutu/Fondak, but there was something wrong here beyond the lack of animal movement. Something flickered at the edges of conscious perception, warning him.\n What hid beneath the hill?\n Lack of animals was bothersome. It aroused his Fremen sense of caution: The absence says more than the presence when it comes to desert survival. But there was a windtrap. There would be water and humans to use it. This was the tabu place which hid behind Fondak\u0027s name, its other identity lost even to the memories of most Fremen. And no birds or animals could be seen there.\n No humans - yet here the Golden Path began.\n His father had once said: \"There\u0027s unknown all around at every moment. That\u0027s where you seek knowledge.\"\n Leto glanced out to his right along the dune crests. There\u0027d been a mother storm recently. Lake Azrak, the gypsum plain, had been exposed from beneath its sandy cover. Fremen superstition said that whoever saw the Biyan, the White Lands, was granted a two-edged wish, a wish which might destroy you. Leto saw only a gypsum plain which told him that open water had existed once here on Arrakis.\n As it would exist once more.\n He peered upward, swinging his gaze all around in the search for movement. The sky was porous after the storm. Light passing through it generated a sensation of milky presence, of a silver sun lost somewhere above the dust veil which persisted in the high altitudes.\n Once more Leto brought his attention back to the sinuous rock. He slipped the binoculars from his Fremkit, focused their motile lenses and peered at the naked greyness, this out-cropping where once the men of Jacurutu had lived. Amplification revealed a thorn bush, the one called Queen of Night. The bush nestled in shadows at a cleft which might be an entrance into the old sietch. He scanned the length of the outcropping. The silver sun turned reds into grey, casting a diffuse flatness over the long expanse of rock.\n He rolled over, turning his back on Jacurutu, scanned the circle of his surroundings through the binoculars. Nothing in that wilderness preserved the marks of human passage. The wind already had obliterated his tracks, leaving only a vague roundness where he had dropped from his worm in the night.\n Again he looked at Jacurutu. Except for the windtrap, there was no sign that men had ever passed this way. And without that sinuous length of rock, there was nothing here to subtract from the bleached sand, a wilderness from horizon to horizon.\n Leto felt suddenly that he was in this place because he had refused to be confined in the system which his ancestors bequeathed him. He thought of how people looked at him, that universal mistake in every glance except Ghanima\u0027s.\n Except for that ragged mob of other memories, this child was never a child.\n I must accept responsibility for the decision we made, he thought.\n Once more he scanned the length of rock. By all the descriptions this had to be Fondak, and no other place could be Jacurutu. He felt a strange resonant relationship with the tabu of this place. In the Bene Gesserit Way, he opened his mind to Jacurutu, seeking to know nothing about it. Knowing was a barrier which prevented learning. For a few moments he allowed himself merely to resonate, making no demands, asking no questions.\n The problem lay within the lack of animal life, but it was a particular thing which alerted him. He perceived it then: there were no scavenger birds - no eagles, no vultures, no hawks. Even when other life hid, these remained. Every watering place in this desert held its chain of life. At the end of the chain were the omnipresent scavengers. Nothing had come to investigate his presence. How well he knew the \"watchdogs of the sietch,\" that line of crouched birds on the cliff\u0027s edge at Tabr, primitive undertakers waiting for flesh. As the Fremen said: \"Our competitors.\" But they said it with no sense of jealousy because questing birds often told when strangers approached.\n What if this Fondak has been abandoned even by the smugglers?\n Leto paused to drink from one of his catchtubes.\n What if there\u0027s truly no water here?\n He reviewed his position. He\u0027d run two worms into the sand getting here, riding them with his flail through the night, leaving them half-dead. This was the Inner Desert where the smugglers\u0027 haven was to be found. If life existed here, if it could exist, it would have to be in the presence of water.\n What if there\u0027s no water? What if this isn\u0027t Fondak/Jacurutu?\n Once more he aimed his binoculars at the windtrap. Its outer edges were sand-etched, in need of maintenance, but enough of it remained. There should be water.\n But what if there isn\u0027t?\n An abandoned sietch might lose its water to the air, to any number of catastrophes. Why were there no scavenger birds? Killed for their water? By whom? How could all of them be eliminated? Poison?\n Poisoned water.\n The legend of Jacurutu contained no story of the cistern poisoned, but it might have been. If the original flocks were slain, would they not have been renewed by this time? The Iduali were wiped out generations ago and the stories never mentioned poison. Again he examined the rock with his binoculars. How could an entire sietch have been wiped out? Certainly some must have escaped. All of the inhabitants of a sietch were seldom at home. Parties roamed the desert, trekked to the towns.\n With a sigh of resignation Leto put away his binoculars. He slipped down the hidden face of the dune, took extra care to dig in his stilltent and conceal all sign of his intrusion as he prepared to spend the hot hours. The sluggish currents of fatigue stole along his limbs as he sealed himself in the darkness. Within the tent\u0027s sweaty, confines he spent much of the day drowsing, imagining mistakes he could have made. His dreams were defensive, but there could be no self-defense in this trial he and Ghanima had chosen. Failure would scald their souls. He ate spice-biscuits and slept, awakened to eat once more, to drink and return to sleep. It had been a long journey to this place, a severe test for the muscles of a child.\n Toward evening he awoke refreshed, listened for signs of life. He crept out of his sandy shroud. There was dust high up in the sky blowing one way, but he could feel sand stinging his cheek from another direction - sure sign there would be a weather change. He sensed a storm coming.\n Cautiously he crept to the crest of his dune, peered once more at those enigmatic rocks. The intervening air was yellow. The signs spoke of a Coriolis storm approaching, the wind that carried death in its belly. There\u0027d be a great winding sheet of wind-driven sand that might stretch across four degrees of latitude. The desolate emptiness of the gypsum pan was a yellow surface now, reflecting the dust clouds. The false peace of evening enfolded him. Then the day collapsed and it was night, the quick night of the Inner Desert. The rocks were transformed into angular peaks frosted by the light of First Moon. He felt sandthorns stinging his skin. A peal of dry thunder sounded like an echo from distant drums and, in the space between moonlight and darkness he saw sudden movement: bats. He could hear the stirring of their wings, their tiny squeaks.\n Bats.\n By design or accident, this place conveyed a sense of abandoned desolation. It was where the half-legendary smuggler stronghold should be: Fondak. But what if it were not Fondak? What if the tabu still ruled and this were only the shell of ghostly Jacurutu?\n Leto crouched in the lee of his dune and waited for the night to settle into its own rhythms. Patience and caution - caution and patience. For a time he amused himself by reviewing Chaucer\u0027s route from London to Canterbury, listing the places from Southwark: two miles to the watering-place of St. Thomas, five miles to Deptford, six miles to Greenwich, thirty miles to Rochester, forty miles to Sittingboume, fifty-five miles to Boughton under Blean, fifty-eight miles to Harbledown, and sixty miles to Canterbury. It gave him a sense of timeless buoyancy to know that few in his universe would recall Chaucer or know any London except the village on Gansireed. St. Thomas was preserved in the Orange Catholic Bible and the Azhar Book, but Canterbury was gone from the memories of men, as was the planet which had known it. There lay the burden of his memories, of all those lives which threatened to engulf him. He had made that trip to Canterbury once.\n His present trip was longer, though, and more dangerous.\n Presently he crept over the dune\u0027s crest and made his way toward the moonlit rocks. He blended with shadows, slid across the crests, made no sounds that might signal his presence.\n The dust had gone as it often did just before a storm, and the night was brilliant. The day had revealed no movement, but he heard small creatures hustling in the darkness as he neared the rocks.\n In a valley between two dunes he came upon a family of jerboa which scampered away at his approach. He eased over the next crest, his emotions beset by salty anxieties. That cleft he had seen - did it lead up to an entrance? And there were other concerns: the old-time sietch had always been guarded by traps - poisoned barbs in pits, poisoned spines on plants. He felt himself caught up in the Fremen agrapha: The ear-minded night. And he listened for the slightest sound.\n The grey rocks lowered above him now, made giant by his nearness. As he listened, he heard birds invisible in that cliff, the soft calling of winged prey. They were the sounds of daybirds, but abroad by night. What had turned their world around? Human predation?\n Abruptly Leto froze against the sand. There was fire on the cliff, a ballet of glittering and mysterious gems against the night\u0027s black gauze, the sort of signal a sietch might send to wanderers across the bled. Who were these occupants of this place? He crept forward into the deepest shadows at the cliff\u0027s base, felt along the rock with a hand, sliding his body behind the hand as he sought the fissure he\u0027d seen by daylight. He located it on his eighth step, slipped the sandsnorkel from his kit and probed the darkness. As he moved, something tight and binding dropped over his shoulders and arms, immobilizing him.\n Trapvine!\n He resisted the urge to struggle; that only made the vine pull tighter. He dropped the snorkel, flexed the fingers of his right hand, trying for the knife at his waist. He felt like a bare innocent for not throwing something into that fissure from a distance, testing the darkness for its dangers. His mind had been too occupied by the fire on the cliff.\n Each movement tightened the trapvine, but his fingers at last touched the knife hilt. Stealthily, he closed his hand around the hilt, began to slip it free.\n Flaring light enveloped him, arresting all movement.\n \"Ahhh, a fine catch in our net.\" It was a heavy masculine voice from behind Leto, something vaguely familiar in the tone. Leto tried to turn his head, aware of the vine\u0027s dangerous propensity to crush a body which moved too freely.\n A hand took his knife, before he could see his captor. The hand moved expertly over his body, extracting the small devices he and Ghanima carried as a matter of survival. Nothing escaped the searcher, not even the shigawire garrote concealed in his hair.\n Leto still had not seen the man.\n Fingers did something with the trapvine and he found he could breathe easier, but the man said: \"Do not struggle, Leto Atreides. I have your water in my cup.\"\n By supreme effort Leto remained calm, said: \"You know my name?\"\n \"Of course! When one baits a trap, it\u0027s for a purpose. One aims for a specific quarry, not so?\"\n Leto remained silent, but his thoughts whirled.\n \"You feel betrayed!\" the heavy voice said. Hands turned him around, gently but with an obvious show of strength. An adult male was telling the child what the odds were.\n Leto stared up into the glare from twin floater flares, saw the black outline of a stillsuit-masked face, the hood. As his eyes adjusted he made out a dark strip of skin, the utterly shadowed eyes of melange addiction.\n \"You wonder why we went to all this trouble,\" the man said. His voice issued from the shielded lower part of his face with a curious muffled quality, as though he tried to conceal an accent.\n \"I long ago ceased to wonder at the numbers of people who want the Atreides twins dead,\" Leto said. \"Their reasons are obvious.\"\n As he spoke, Leto\u0027s mind flung itself against the unknown as against a cage, questing wildly for answers. A baited trap? But who had known except Ghanima? Impossible! Ghanima wouldn\u0027t betray her own brother. Then did someone know him well enough to predict his actions? Who? His grandmother? How could she?\n \"You could not be permitted to go on as you were,\" the man said. \"Very bad. Before ascending the throne, you need to be educated.\" The whiteless eyes stared down at him. \"You wonder how one could presume to educate such a person as yourself? You, with the knowledge of a multitude held there in your memories? That\u0027s just it, you see! You think yourself educated, but all you are is a repository of dead lives. You don\u0027t yet have a life of your own. You\u0027re just a walking surfeit of others, all with one goal - to seek death. Not good in a ruler, being a death seeker. You\u0027d strew your surroundings with corpses. Your father, for example, never understood the -\"\n \"You dare speak of him that way?\"\n \"Many\u0027s the time I\u0027ve dared it. He was only Paul Atreides, after all. Well, boy, welcome to your school.\"\n The man brought a hand from beneath his robe, touched Leto\u0027s cheek. Leto felt the jolt of a slapshot and found himself winding downward into a darkness where a green flag waved. It was the green banner of the Atreides with its day and night symbols, its Dune staff which concealed a water tube. He heard the water gurgling as unconsciousness enfolded him. Or was it someone chuckling?\n We can still remember the golden days before Heisenberg, who showed humans the walls enclosing our predestined arguments. The lives within me find this amusing. Knowledge, you see, has no uses without purpose, but purpose is what builds enclosing walls. -Leto Atreides II, His Voice\n Alia found herself speaking harshly to the guards she confronted in the Temple foyer. There were nine of them in the dusty green uniforms of the suburban patrol, and they were still panting and sweating with their exertions. The light of late afternoon came in the door behind them. The area had been cleared of pilgrims.\n \"So my orders mean nothing to you?\" she demanded.\n And she wondered at her own anger, not trying to contain it but letting it run. Her body trembled with unleashed tensions. Idaho gone... the Lady Jessica... no reports... only rumors that they were on Salusa. Why hadn\u0027t Idaho sent a message? What had he done? Had he learned finally about Javid?\n Alia wore the yellow of Arrakeen mourning, the color of the burning sun from Fremen history. In a few minutes she would be leading the second and final funeral procession to Old Gap, there to complete the stone marker for her lost nephew. The work would be completed in the night, fitting homage to one who\u0027d been destined to lead Fremen.\n The priestly guards appeared defiant in the face of her anger, not shamed at all. They stood in front of her, outlined by the waning light. The odor of their perspiration was easily detected through the light and inefficient stillsuits of city dwellers. Their leader, a tall blond Kaza with the bourka symbols of the Cadelam family, flung his stillsuit mask aside to speak more clearly. His voice was full of the prideful intonations to be expected from a scion of the family which once had ruled at Sietch Abbir.\n \"Certainly we tried to capture him!\"\n The man was obviously outraged at her attack. \"He speaks blasphemy! We know your orders, but we heard him with our own ears!\"\n \"And you failed to catch him,\" Alia said, her voice low and accusing.\n One of the other guards, a short young woman, tried to defend them. \"The crowds were thick there! I swear people interfered with us!\"\n \"We\u0027ll keep after him,\" the Cadelam said. \"We\u0027ll not always fail.\"\n Alia scowled. \"Why won\u0027t you understand and obey me?\"\n \"My Lady, we -\"\n \"What will you do, scion of the Cade Lamb, if you capture him and find him to be, in truth, my brother?\"\n He obviously did not hear her special emphasis on his name, although he could not be a priestly guard without some education and the wit to go with it. Did he want to sacrifice himself?\n The guardsman swallowed, then: \"We must kill him ourselves, for he breeds disorder.\"\n The others stood aghast at this, but still defiant. They knew what they had heard.\n \"He calls upon the tribes to band against you,\" the Cadelam said.\n Alia knew how to handle him now. She spoke in a quiet, matter-of-fact tone: \"I see. Then if you must sacrifice yourself this way, taking him openly for all to see who you are and what you do, then I guess you must.\"\n \"Sacrifice my...\" He broke off, glanced at his companions. As Kaza of this group, their appointed leader, he had the right to speak for them, but he showed signs that he wished he\u0027d remained silent. The other guards stirred uncomfortably. In the heat of the chase they\u0027d defied Alia. One could only reflect now upon such defiance of the \"Womb of Heaven.\" With obvious discomfort the guards opened a small space between themselves and their Kaza.\n \"For the good of the Church, our official reaction would have to be severe,\" Alia said. \"You understand that, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"But he -\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard him myself,\" she said. \"But this is a special case.\"\n \"He cannot be Muad\u0027Dib, My Lady!\"\n How little you know! she thought. She said: \"We cannot risk taking him in the open, harming him where others could see it. If another opportunity presents itself, of course.\"\n \"He\u0027s always surrounded by crowds these days!\"\n \"Then I fear you must be patient. Of course, if you insist on defying me...\" She left the consequences hanging in the air, unspoken, but well understood. The Cadelam was ambitious, a shining career before him.\n \"We didn\u0027t mean defiance, My Lady.\" The man had himself under control now. \"We acted hastily; I can see that. Forgive us, but he -\"\n \"Nothing has happened; nothing to forgive,\" she said, using the common Fremen formula. It was one of the many ways a tribe kept peace in its ranks, and this Cadelam was still Old Fremen enough to remember that. His family carried a long tradition of leadership. Guilt was the Naib\u0027s whip, to be used sparingly. Fremen served best when free of guilt or resentment.\n He showed his realization of her judgment by bowing his head, saying: \"For the good of the tribe; I understand.\"\n \"Go refresh yourselves,\" she said. \"The procession begins in a few minutes.\"\n \"Yes, My Lady.\" They bustled away, every movement revealing their relief at this escape.\n Within Alia\u0027s head a bass rumbled: \"Ahhhhh, you handled that most adroitly. One or two of them still believe you desire The Preacher dead. They\u0027ll find a way.\"\n \"Shut up!\" she hissed. \"Shut up! I should never have listened to you! Look what you\u0027ve done...\"\n \"Set you on the road to immortality,\" the bass voice said.\n She felt it echoing in her skull like a distant ache, thought: Where can I hide? There\u0027s no place to go!\n \"Ghanima\u0027s knife is sharp,\" the Baron said. \"Remember that.\"\n Alia blinked. Yes, that was something to remember. Ghanima\u0027s knife was sharp. That knife might yet cut them out of their present predicament.\n If you believe certain words, you believe their hidden arguments. When you believe something is right or wrong, true or false, you believe the assumptions in the words which express the arguments. Such assumptions are often full of holes, but remain most precious to the convinced. -The Open-Ended Proof from, The Panoplia Prophetica\n Leto\u0027s mind floated in a stew of fierce odors. He recognized the heavy cinnamon of melange, the confined sweat of working bodies, the acridity of an uncapped deathstill, dust of many sorts with flint dominant. The odors formed a trail through dreamsand, created shapes of fog in a dead land. He knew these odors should tell him something, but part of him could not yet listen.\n Thoughts like wraiths floated through his mind: In this time I have no finished features; I am all of my ancestors. The sun setting into the sand is the sun setting into my soul. Once this multitude within me was great, but that\u0027s ended. I\u0027m Fremen and I\u0027ll have a Fremen ending. The Golden Path is ended before it began. It\u0027s nothing but a windblown trail. We Fremen knew all the tricks to conceal ourselves: we left no feces, no water, no tracks... Now, look at my trail vanish.\n A masculine voice spoke close to his ear: \"I could kill you, Atreides. I could kill you, Atreides.\" It was repeated over and over until it lost meaning, became a wordless thing carried within Leto\u0027s dreaming, a litany of sorts: \"I could kill you, Atreides.\"\n Leto cleared his throat and felt the reality of this simple act shake his senses. His dry throat managed: \"Who...\"\n The voice beside him said: \"I\u0027m an educated Fremen and I\u0027ve killed my man. You took away our gods, Atreides. What do we care about your stinking Muad\u0027Dib? Your god\u0027s dead!\"\n Was that a real Ouraba voice or another part of his dream? Leto opened his eyes, found himself unfettered on a hard couch. He looked upward at rock, dim glowglobes, an unmasked face staring down at him so close he could smell the breath with its familiar odors of a sietch diet. The face was Fremen; no mistaking the dark skin, those sharp features and water-wasted flesh. This was no fat city dweller. Here was a desert Fremen.\n \"I am Namri, father of Javid,\" the Fremen said. \"Do you know me now, Atreides?\"\n \"I know Javid,\" Leto husked.\n \"Yes, your family knows my son well. I am proud of him. You Atreides may know him even better soon.\"\n \"What...\"\n \"I am one of your schoolmasters, Atreides. I have only one function: I am the one who could kill you. I\u0027d do it gladly. In this school, to graduate is to live; to fail is to be given into my hands.\"\n Leto heard implacable sincerity in that voice. It chilled him. This was a human gom jabbar, a high-handed enemy to test his right of entrance into the human concourse. Leto sensed his grandmother\u0027s hand in this and, behind her, the faceless masses of the Bene Gesserit. He writhed at this thought.\n \"Your education begins with me,\" Namri said. \"That is just. It is fitting. Because it could end with me. Listen to me carefully now. My every word carries your life in it. Everything about me holds your death within it.\"\n Leto shot his glance around the room: rock walls, barren - only this couch, the dim glowglobes, and a dark passage behind Namri.\n \"You will not get past me,\" Namri said. And Leto believed him.\n \"Why\u0027re you doing this?\" Leto asked.\n \"That\u0027s already been explained. Think what plans are in your head! You are here and you cannot put a future into your present condition. The two don\u0027t go together: now and future. But if you really know your past, if you look backward and see where you\u0027ve been, perhaps there\u0027ll be reason once more. If not, there will be your death.\"\n Leto noted that Namri\u0027s tone was not unkind, but it was firm and no denying the death in it.\n Namri rocked back on his heels, stared at the rock ceiling. \"In olden times Fremen faced east at dawn. Eos, you know? That\u0027s dawn in one of the old tongues.\"\n Bitter pride in his voice, Leto said: \"I speak that tongue.\"\n \"You have not listened to me, then,\" Namri said, and there was a knife edge in his voice. \"Night was the time of chaos. Day was the time of order. That\u0027s how it was in the time of that tongue you say you speak: darkness-disorder, light-order. We Fremen changed that. Eos was the light we distrusted. We preferred the light of a moon, or the stars. Light was too much order and that can be fatal. You see what you Eos-Atreides have done? Man is a creature of only that light which protects him. The sun was our enemy on Dune.\" Namri brought his gaze down to Leto\u0027s level. \"What light do you prefer, Atreides?\"\n By Namri\u0027s poised attitude, Leto sensed that this question carried deep weight. Would the man kill him if he failed to answer correctly? He might. Leto saw Namri\u0027s hand resting quietly next to the polished hilt of a crysknife. A ring in the form of a magic tortoise glittered on the Fremen\u0027s knife hand.\n Leto eased himself up onto his elbows, sent his mind questing into Fremen beliefs. They trusted the Law and loved to hear its lessons expounded in analogy, these old Fremen. The light of the moon?\n \"I prefer... the light of Lisanu L\u0027haqq,\" Leto said, watching Namri for subtle revelations. The man seemed disappointed, but his hand moved away from his knife. \"It is the light of truth, the light of the perfect man in which the influence of al-Mutakallim can clearly be seen,\" Leto continued. \"What other light would a human prefer?\"\n \"You speak as one who recites, not one who believes,\" Namri said.\n And Leto thought: I did recite. But he began to sense the drift of Namri\u0027s thoughts, how his words were filtered through early training in the ancient riddle game. Thousands of these riddles went into Fremen training, and Leto had but to bend his attention upon this custom to find examples flooding his mind. \"Challenge: Silence? Answer: The friend of the hunted. \"\n Namri nodded to himself as though he shared this thought, said: \"There is a cave which is the cave of life for Fremen. It is an actual cave which the desert has hidden. Shai-Hulud, the great-grandfather of all Fremen, sealed up that cave. My Uncle Ziamad told me about it and he never lied to me. There is such a cave.\"\n Leto heard the challenging silence when Namri finished speaking. Cave of life? \"My Uncle Stilgar also told me of that cave,\" Leto said. \"It was sealed to keep cowards from hiding there.\"\n The reflection of a glowglobe glittered in Namri\u0027s shadowed eyes. He asked: \"Would you Atreides open that cave? You seek to control life through a ministry: your Central Ministry for Information, Auqaf and Hajj. The Maulana in charge is called Kausar. He has come a long way from his family\u0027s beginnings at the salt mines of Niazi. Tell me, Atreides, what is wrong with your ministry?\"\n Leto sat up, aware now that he was fully into the riddle game with Namri and that the forfeit was death. The man gave every indication that he\u0027d use that crysknife at the first wrong answer.\n Namri, recognizing this awareness in Leto, said: \"Believe me, Atreides. I am the clod-crusher. I am the Iron Hammer.\"\n Now Leto understood. Namri saw himself as Mirzabah, the Iron Hammer with which the dead are beaten who cannot reply satisfactorily to the questions they must answer before entry into paradise.\n What was wrong with the central ministry which Alia and her priests had created?\n Leto thought of why he\u0027d come into the desert, and a small hope returned to him that the Golden Path might yet appear in his universe. What this Namri implied by his question was no more than the motive which had driven Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s own son into the desert.\n \"God\u0027s it is to show the way,\" Leto said.\n Namri\u0027s chin jerked down and he stared sharply at Leto. \"Can it be true that you believe this?\" he demanded.\n \"It\u0027s why I am here,\" Leto said.\n \"To find the way?\"\n \"To find it for myself.\" Leto put his feet over the edge of the cot. The rock floor was uncarpeted, cold. \"The Priests created their ministry to hide the way.\"\n \"You speak like a true rebel,\" Namri said, and he rubbed the tortoise ring on his finger. \"We shall see. Listen carefully once more. You know the high Shield Wall at Jalalud-Din? That Wall bears my family\u0027s marks carved there in the first days. Javid, my son, has seen those marks. Abedi Jalal, my nephew, has seen them. Mujahid Shafqat of the Other Ones, he too has seen our marks. In the season of the storms near Sukkar, I came down with my friend Yakup Abad near that place. The winds were blistering hot like the whirlwinds from which we learned our dances. We did not take time to see the marks because a storm blocked the way. But when the storm passed we saw the vision of Thatta upon the blown sand. The face of Shakir Ali was there for a moment, looking down upon his city of tombs. The vision was gone in the instant, but we all saw it. Tell me, Atreides, where can I find that city of tombs?\"\n The whirlwinds from which we learned our dances, Leto thought. The vision of Thatta and Shakir Ali. These were the words of a Zensunni Wanderer, those who considered themselves to be the only true men of the desert.\n And Fremen were forbidden to have tombs.\n \"The city of tombs is at the end of the path which all men follow,\" Leto said. And he dredged up the Zensunni beatifies. \"It is in a garden one thousand paces square. There is a fine entry corridor two hundred and thirty-three paces long and one hundred paces wide all paved with marble from ancient Jaipur. Therein dwells ar-Razzaq, he who provides food for all who ask. And on the Day of Reckoning, all who stand up and seek the city of tombs shall not find it. For it is written: That which you know in one world, you shall not find in another.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-20.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) \n The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
