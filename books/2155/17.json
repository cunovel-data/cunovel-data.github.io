{"id":97161,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\"He speaks of seeking asylum for her,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"That might follow if those rumors...\" \"Precisely,\" his mother said. \"Or it could be a ruse of some sort,\" Tyekanik said. \"We can make several assumptions and explore them,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"What if Idaho has fallen into disfavor with his Lady Alia?\" \"That might explain matters,\" Wensicia said, \"but he -\" \"No word yet from the smugglers?\" Farad\u0027n interrupted. \"Why can\u0027t we -\" \"Transmission is always slow in this season,\" Tyekanik said, \"and the needs of security...\" \"Yes, of course, but still...\" Farad\u0027n shook his head. \"I don\u0027t like our assumption.\" \"Don\u0027t be too quick to abandon it,\" Wensicia said. \"All of those stories about Alia and that Priest, whatever his name is...\" \"Javid,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"But the man\u0027s obviously -\" \"He\u0027s been a valuable source of information for us,\" Wensicia said. \"I was about to say that he\u0027s obviously a double agent,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"How could he indict himself in this? He\u0027s not to be trusted. There are too many signs...\" \"I fail to see them,\" she said. He was suddenly angry with her denseness. \"Take my word for it, mother! The signs are there; I\u0027ll explain later.\" \"I\u0027m afraid I must agree,\" Tyekanik said. Wensicia lapsed into hurt silence. How dared they push her out of Council like this? As though she were some light-headed fancy woman with no - \"We mustn\u0027t forget that Idaho was once a ghola,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"The Tleilaxu...\" He glanced sidelong at Tyekanik. \"That avenue will be explored,\" Tyekanik said. He found himself admiring the way Farad\u0027n\u0027s mind worked: alert, questing, sharp. Yes, the Tleilaxu, in restoring life to Idaho, might have planted a powerful barb in him for their own use. \"But I fail to apprehend a Tleilaxu motive,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"An investment in our fortunes,\" Tyekanik said. \"A small insurance for future favors?\" \"Large investment, I\u0027d call it,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"Dangerous,\" Wensicia said. Farad\u0027n had to agree with her. The Lady Jessica\u0027s capabilities were notorious in the Empire. After all, she\u0027d been the one who\u0027d trained Muad\u0027Dib. \"If it became known that we hold her,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"Yes, that\u0027d be a two-edged sword,\" Tyekanik said. \"But it need not be known.\" \"Let us assume,\" Farad\u0027n said, \"that we accept this offer. What\u0027s her value? Can we exchange her for something of greater importance?\" \"Not openly,\" Wensicia said. \"Of course not!\" He peered expectantly at Tyekanik. \"That remains to be seen,\" Tyekanik said. Farad\u0027n nodded. \"Yes. I think if we accept, we should consider the Lady Jessica as money banked for indeterminate use. After all, wealth doesn\u0027t necessarily have to be spent on any particular thing. It\u0027s just... potentially useful.\" \"She\u0027d be a very dangerous captive,\" Tyekanik said. \"There is that to consider, indeed,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"I\u0027m told that her Bene Gesserit Ways permit her to manipulate a person just by the subtle employment of her voice.\" \"Or her body,\" Wensicia said. \"Irulan once divulged to me some of the things she\u0027d learned. She was showing off at the time, and I saw no demonstrations. Still the evidence is pretty conclusive that Bene Gesserits have their ways of achieving their ends.\" \"Were you suggesting,\" Farad\u0027n asked, \"that she might seduce me?\" Wensicia merely shrugged. \"I\u0027d say she\u0027s a little old for that, wouldn\u0027t you?\" Farad\u0027n asked. \"With a Bene Gesserit, nothing\u0027s certain,\" Tyekanik said. Farad\u0027n experienced a shiver of excitement tinged with fear. Playing this game to restore House of Corrino\u0027s high seat of power both attracted and repelled him. How attractive it remained, the urge to retire from this game into his preferred pursuits - historical research and learning the manifest duties for ruling here on Salusa Secundus. The restoration of his Sardaukar forces was a task in itself... and for that job, Tyek was still a good tool. One planet was, after all, an enormous responsibility. But the Empire was an even greater responsibility, far more attractive as an instrument of power. And the more he read about Muad\u0027Dib/Paul Atreides, the more fascinated Farad\u0027n became with the uses of power. As titular head of House Corrino, heir of Shaddam IV, what a great achievement it would be to restore his line to the Lion Throne. He wanted that! He wanted it. Farad\u0027n had found that, by repeating this enticing litany to himself several times, he could overcome momentary doubts. Tyekanik was speaking: \"... and of course, the Bene Gesserit teach that peace encourages aggressions, thus igniting war. The paradox of -\" \"How did we get on this subject?\" Farad\u0027n asked, bringing his attention back from the arena of speculation. \"Why,\" Wensicia said sweetly, having noted the woolgathering expression on her son\u0027s face, \"I merely asked if Tyek was familiar with the driving philosophy behind the Sisterhood.\" \"Philosophy should be approached with irreverence,\" Farad\u0027n said, turning to face Tyekanik. \"In regard to Idaho\u0027s offer, I think we should inquire further. When we think we know something, that\u0027s precisely the moment when we should look deeper into the thing.\" \"It will be done,\" Tyekanik said. He liked this cautious streak in Farad\u0027n, but hoped it did not extend to those military decisions which required speed and precision. With seeming irrelevancy, Farad\u0027n asked: \"Do you know what I find most interesting about the history of Arrakis? It was the custom in primitive times for Fremen to kill on sight anyone not clad in a stillsuit with its easily visible and characteristic hood.\" \"What is your fascination with the stillsuit?\" Tyekanik asked. \"So you\u0027ve noticed, eh?\" \"How could we not notice?\" Wensicia asked. Farad\u0027n sent an irritated glance at his mother. Why did she interrupt like that? He returned his attention to Tyekanik. \"The stillsuit is the key to that planet\u0027s character, Tyek. It\u0027s the hallmark of Dune. People tend to focus on the physical characteristics: the stillsuit conserves body moisture, recycles it, and makes it possible to exist on such a planet. You know, the Fremen custom was to have one stillsuit for each member of a family, except for food gatherers. They had spares. But please note, both of you -\" He moved to include his mother in this. \"- how garments which appear to be stillsuits, but really aren\u0027t, have become high fashion throughout the Empire. It\u0027s such a dominant characteristic for humans to copy the conqueror!\" \"Do you really find such information valuable?\" Tyekanik asked, his tone puzzled. \"Tyek, Tyek - without such information, one cannot govern. I said the stillsuit was the key to their character and it is! It\u0027s a conservative thing. The mistakes they make will be conservative mistakes.\" Tyekanik glanced at Wensicia, who was staring at her son with a worried frown. This characteristic of Farad\u0027n\u0027s both attracted and worried the Bashar. It was so unlike old Shaddam. Now, there had been an essential Sardaukar: a military killer with few inhibitions. But Shaddam had fallen to the Atreides under that damnable Paul. Indeed, what he read of Paul Atreides revealed just such characteristics as Farad\u0027n now displayed. It was possible that Farad\u0027n might hesitate less than the Atreides over brutal necessities, but that was his Sardaukar training. \"Many have governed without using this kind of information,\" Tyekanik said. Farad\u0027n merely stared at him for a moment. Then: \"Governed and failed.\" Tyekanik\u0027s mouth drew into a stiff line at this obvious allusion to Shaddam\u0027s failure. That had been a Sardaukar failure, too, and no Sardaukar could recall it easily. Having made his point, Farad\u0027n said: \"You see, Tyek, the influence of a planet upon the mass unconscious of its inhabitants has never been fully appreciated. To defeat the Atreides, we must understand not only Caladan but Arrakis: one planet soft and the other a training ground for hard decisions. That was a unique event, that marriage of Atreides and Fremen. We must know how it worked or we won\u0027t be able to match it, let alone defeat it.\" \"What does this have to do with Idaho\u0027s offer?\" Wensicia demanded. Farad\u0027n glanced pityingly down at his mother. \"We begin their defeat by the kinds of stress we introduce into their society. That\u0027s a very powerful tool: stress. And the lack of it is important, too. Did you not mark how the Atreides helped things grow soft and easy here?\" Tyekanik allowed himself a curt nod of agreement. That was a good point. The Sardaukar could not be permitted to grow too soft. This offer from Idaho still bothered him, though. He said: \"Perhaps it\u0027d be best to reject the offer.\" \"Not yet,\" Wensicia said. \"We\u0027ve a spectrum of choices open to us. Our task is to identify as much of the spectrum as we can. My son is right: we need more information.\" Farad\u0027n stared at her, measuring her intent as well as the surface meaning of her words. \"But will we know when we\u0027ve passed the point of no alternate choice?\" he asked. A sour chuckle came from Tyekanik. \"If you ask me, we\u0027re long past the point of no return.\" Farad\u0027n tipped his head back to laugh aloud. \"But we still have alternate choices, Tyek! When we come to the end of our rope, that\u0027s an important place to recognize!\" In this age when the means of human transport include devices which can span the deeps of space in transtime, and other devices which can carry men swiftly over virtually impassable planetary surfaces, it seems odd to think of attempting long journeys afoot. Yet this remains a primary means of travel on Arrakis, a fact attributed partly to preference and partly to the brutal treatment which this planet reserves for anything mechanical. In the strictures of Arrakis, human flesh remains the most durable and reliable resource for the Hajj. Perhaps it is the implicit awareness of this fact which makes Arrakis the ultimate mirror of the soul. -Handbook of the Hajj Slowly, cautiously, Ghanima made her way back to Tabr, holding herself to the deepest shadows of the dunes, crouching in stillness as the search party passed to the south of her. Terrible awareness gripped her: the worm which had taken the tigers and Leto\u0027s body, the dangers ahead. He was gone; her twin was gone. She put aside all tears and nurtured her rage. In this, she was pure Fremen. And she knew this, reveling in it. She understood what was said about Fremen. They were not supposed to have a conscience, having lost it in a burning for revenge against those who had driven them from planet to planet in the long wandering. That was foolishness, of course. Only the rawest primitive had no conscience. Fremen possessed a highly evolved conscience which centered on their own welfare as a people. It was only to outsiders that they seemed brutish - just as outsiders appeared brutish to Fremen. Every Fremen knew very well that he could do a brutal thing and feel no guilt. Fremen did not feel guilt for the same things that aroused such feelings in others. Their rituals provided a freedom from guilts which might otherwise have destroyed them. They knew in their deepest awareness that any transgression could be ascribed, at least in part, to well recognized extenuating circumstances: \"the failure of authority,\" or \"a natural bad tendency\" shared by all humans, or to \"bad luck,\" which any sentient creature should be able to identify as a collision between mortal flesh and the outer chaos of the universe. In this context Ghanima felt herself to be the pure Fremen, a carefully prepared extension of tribal brutality. She needed only a target - and that, obviously, was House Corrino. She longed to see Farad\u0027n\u0027s blood spilled on the ground at her feet. No enemy awaited her at the qanat. Even the search parties had gone elsewhere. She crossed the water on an earth bridge, crept through tall grass toward the covert exit of the sietch. Abruptly light flared ahead of her and Ghanima threw herself flat on the ground. She peered out through stalks of giant alfalfa. A woman had entered the covert passage from the outside, and someone had remembered to prepare that passage in the way any sietch entrance should be prepared. In troubled times, one greeted anyone entering the sietch with bright light, temporarily blinding the newcomer and giving guards time to decide. But such a greeting was never meant to be broadcast out over the desert. The light visible here meant the outer seals had been left aside. Ghanima felt a tug of bitterness at this betrayal of sietch security: this flowing light. The ways of the lace-shirt Fremen were to be found everywhere! The light continued to throw its fan over the ground at the cliff base. A young girl ran out of the orchard\u0027s darkness into the light, something fearful about her movements. Ghanima could see the bright circle of a glowglobe within the passage, a halo of insects around it. The light illuminated two dark shadows in the passage: a man and the girl. They were holding hands as they stared into each other\u0027s eyes. Ghanima sensed something wrong about the man and woman there. They were not just two lovers stealing a moment from the search. The light was suspended above and beyond them in the passage. The two talked against a glowing arch, throwing their shadows into the outer night where anyone could be a watcher of their movements. Now and again the man would free a hand. The hand would come gesturing into the light, a sharp and furtive movement which, once completed, returned to the shadows. Lonely sounds of night creatures filled the darkness around Ghanima, but she screened out such distractions. What was it about those two? The man\u0027s motions were so static, so careful. He turned. Reflection from the woman\u0027s robe illuminated him, exposing a raw red face with a large blotchy nose. Ghanima drew in a deep, silent breath of recognition. Palimbasha! He was a grandson of a Naib whose sons had fallen in Atreides service. The face - and another thing revealed by the open swinging of his robe as he turned - drew for Ghanima a complete picture. He wore a belt beneath the robe, and attached to the belt was a box which glistened with keys and dials. It was an instrument of the Tleilaxu or the Ixians for certain. And it had to be the transmitter which had released the tigers. Palimbasha. This meant that another Naibate family had gone over to House Corrino. Who was the woman, then? No matter. She was someone being used by Palimbasha. Unbidden, a Bene Gesserit thought came into Ghanima\u0027s mind: Each planet has its own period, and each life likewise. She recalled Palimbasha well, watching him there with that woman, seeing the transmitter, the furtive movements. Palimbasha taught in the sietch school. Mathematics. The man was a mathematical boor. He had attempted to explain Muad\u0027Dib through mathematics until censured by the Priesthood. He was a mind-slaver and his enslaving process could be understood with extreme simplicity: he transferred technical knowledge without a transfer of values. I should\u0027ve suspected him earlier, she thought. The signs were all there. Then, with an acid tightening of her stomach: He killed my brother! She forced herself to calmness. Palimbasha would kill her, too, if she tried to pass him there in the covert passage. Now she understood the reason for this un-Fremen display of light, this betrayal of the hidden entrance. They were watching by that light to see if either of their victims had escaped. It must be a terrible time of waiting for them, not knowing. And now that Ghanima had seen the transmitter, she could explain certain of the hand motions. Palimbasha was depressing one of the transmitter\u0027s keys frequently, an angry gesture. The presence of this pair said much to Ghanima. Likely every way into the sietch carried a similar watcher in its depths. She scratched her nose where dust tickled it. Her wounded leg still throbbed and the knife arm ached when it didn\u0027t burn. The fingers remained numb. Should it come to a knife, she would have to use the blade in her left hand. Ghanima thought of using the maula pistol, but its characteristic sound would be sure to attract unwanted attention. Some other way would have to be found. Palimbasha turned away from the entrance once more. He was a dark object against the light. The woman turned her attention to the outer night while she talked. There was a trained alertness about the woman, a sense that she knew how to look into the shadows, using the edges of her eyes. She was more than just a useful tool, then. She was part of the deeper conspiracy. Ghanima recalled now that Palimbasha aspired to be a Kaymakam, a political governor under the Regency. He would be part of a larger plan, that was clear. There would be many others with him. Even here in Tabr. Ghanima examined the edges of the problem thus exposed, probed into it. If she could take one of these guardians alive, many others would be forfeit. The whiffle of a small animal drinking at the qanat behind her caught Ghanima\u0027s awareness. Natural sounds and natural things. Her memory searched through a strange silent barrier in her mind, found a priestess of Jowf captured in Assyria by Sennacherib. The memories of that priestess told Ghanima what would have to be done here. Palimbasha and his woman there were mere children, wayward and dangerous. They knew nothing of Jowf, knew not even the name of the planet where Sennacherib and the priestess had faded into dust. The thing which was about to happen to the pair of conspirators, if it were explained to them, could only be explained in terms of beginning here. And ending here. Rolling onto her side, Ghanima freed her Fremkit, slipped the sandsnorkel from its bindings. She uncapped the sandsnorkel, removed the long filter within it. Now she had an open tube. She selected a needle from the repair pack, unsheathed her crysknife, and inserted the needle into the poison hollow at the knife\u0027s tip, that place where once a sandworm\u0027s nerve had fitted. Her injured arm made the work difficult. She moved carefully and slowly, handling the poisoned needle with caution while she took a wad of spice-fiber from its chamber in the kit. The needle\u0027s shank fitted tightly into the fiber wad, forming a missile which went tightly into the tube of the sandsnorkel. Holding the weapon flat, Ghanima wormed her way closer to the light, moving slowly to cause minimal disturbance in the alfalfa. As she moved, she studied the insects around the light. Yes, there were piume flies in that fluttering mob. They were notorious biters of human flesh. The poisoned dart might go unnoticed, swatted aside as a biting fly. A decision remained: Which one of those two to take - the man or the woman! Muriz. The name came unbidden into Ghanima\u0027s mind. That was the woman\u0027s name. It recalled things said about her. She was one of those who fluttered around Palimbasha as the insects fluttered around the light. She was easily swayed, a weak one. Very well. Palimbasha had chosen the wrong companion for this night. Ghanima put the tube to her mouth and, with the memory of the priestess of Jowf clearly in her awareness, she sighted carefully, expelled her breath in one strong surge. Palimbasha batted at his cheek, drew away a hand with a speck of blood on it. The needle was nowhere to be seen, flicked away by the motion of his own hand. The woman said something soothing and Palimbasha laughed. As he laughed, his legs began to give away beneath him. He sagged against the woman, who tried to support him. She was still staggering with the dead weight when Ghanima came up beside her and pressed the point of an unsheathed crysknife against her waist. In a conversational tone, Ghanima said: \"Make no sudden moves, Muriz. My knife is poisoned. You may let go of Palimbasha now. He is dead.\" In all major socializing forces you will find an underlying movement to gain and maintain power through the use of words. From witch doctor to priest to bureaucrat it is all the same. A governed populace must be conditioned to accept power-words as actual things, to confuse the symbolized system with the tangible universe. In the maintenance of such a power structure, certain symbols are kept out of the reach of common understanding - symbols such as those dealing with economic manipulation or those which define the local interpretation of sanity. Symbol-secrecy of this form leads to the development of fragmented sub-languages, each being a signal that its users are accumulating some form of power. With this insight into a power process, our Imperial Security Force must be ever alert to the formation of sub-languages. -Lecture to the Arrakeen War College by, The Princess Irulan \"It is perhaps unnecessary to tell you,\" Farad\u0027n said, \"but to avoid any errors I\u0027ll announce that a mute has been stationed with orders to kill you both should I show signs of succumbing to witchery.\" He did not expect to see any effect from these words. Both the Lady Jessica and Idaho gratified his expectations. Farad\u0027n had chosen with care the setting for this first examination of the pair, Shaddam\u0027s old State Audience Chamber. What it lacked in grandeur it made up for with exotic appointments. Outside it was a winter afternoon, but the windowless chamber\u0027s lighting simulated a timeless summer day bathed in golden light from artfully scattered glowglobes of the purest Ixian crystal. The news from Arrakis filled Farad\u0027n with quiet elation. Leto, the male twin, was dead, killed by an assassin-tiger. Ghanima, the surviving sister, was in the custody of her aunt and reputedly was a hostage. The full report did much to explain the presence of Idaho and the Lady Jessica. Sanctuary was what they wanted. Corrino spies reported an uneasy truce on Arrakis. Alia had agreed to submit herself to a test called \"the Trial of Possession,\" the purpose of which had not been fully explained. However, no date had been set for this trial and two Corrino spies believed it might never take place. This much was certain, though: there had been fighting between desert Fremen and the Imperial Military Fremen, an abortive civil war which had brought government to a temporary standstill. Stilgar\u0027s holdings were now neutral ground, designated after an exchange of hostages. Ghanima evidently had been considered one of these hostages, although the working of this remained unclear. Jessica and Idaho had been brought to the audience securely bound in suspensor chairs. Both were held down by deadly thin strands of shigawire which would cut flesh at the slightest struggle. Two Sardaukar troopers had brought them, checked the bindings, and had gone away silently. The warning had, indeed, been unnecessary. Jessica had seen the armed mute standing against a wall at her right, an old but efficient projectile weapon in his hand. She allowed her gaze to roam over the room\u0027s exotic inlays. The broad leaves of the rare iron bush had been set with eye pearls and interlaced to form the center crescent of the domed ceiling. The floor beneath her was alternate blocks of diamond wood and kabuzu shell arranged within rectangular borders of passaquet bones. These had been set on end, laser-cut and polished. Selected hard materials decorated the walls in stress-woven patterns which outlined the four positions of the Lion symbol claimed by descendants of the late Shaddam IV. The lions were executed in wild gold. Farad\u0027n had chosen to receive the captives while standing. He wore uniform shorts and a light golden jacket of elf-silk open at the throat. His only decoration was the princely starburst of his royal family worn at the left breast. He was attended by the Bashar Tyekanik wearing Sardaukar dress tans and heavy boots, an ornate lasegun carried in a front holster at the belt buckle. Tyekanik, whose heavy visage was known to Jessica from Bene Gesserit reports, stood three paces to the left and slightly behind Farad\u0027n. A single throne of dark wood sat on the floor near the wall directly behind the two. \"Now,\" Farad\u0027n said, addressing Jessica, \"do you have anything to say?\" \"I would inquire why we are bound thus?\" Jessica said, indicating the shigawire. \"We have only just now received reports from Arrakis to explain your presence here,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"Perhaps I\u0027ll have you released presently.\" He smiled. \"If you -\" He broke off as his mother entered by the State doors behind the captives. Wensicia hurried past Jessica and Idaho without a glance, presented a small message cube to Farad\u0027n, actuated it. He studied the glowing face, glancing occasionally at Jessica, back to the cube. The glowing face went dark and he returned the cube to his mother, indicated that she should show it to Tyekanik. While she was doing this, he scowled at Jessica. Presently Wensicia stationed herself at Farad\u0027n\u0027s right hand, the darkened cube in her hand, partly concealed in a fold of her white gown. Jessica glanced to her right at Idaho, but he refused to meet her gaze. \"The Bene Gesserit are displeased with me,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"They believe I was responsible for the death of your grandson.\" Jessica held her face emotionless, thinking: So Ghanima\u0027s story is to be trusted, unless... She didn\u0027t like the suspected unknowns. Idaho closed his eyes, opened them to glance at Jessica, She continued to stare at Farad\u0027n. Idaho had told her about this Rhajia vision, but she\u0027d seemed unworried. He didn\u0027t know how to catalogue her lack of emotion. She obviously knew something, though, that she wasn\u0027t revealing. \"This is the situation,\" Farad\u0027n said, and he proceeded to explain everything he\u0027d learned about events on Arrakis, leaving out nothing. He concluded: \"Your granddaughter survives, but she\u0027s reportedly in the custody of the Lady Alia. This should gratify you.\" \"Did you kill my grandson?\" Jessica asked. Farad\u0027n answered truthfully: \"I did not. I recently learned of a plot, but it was not of my making.\" Jessica looked at Wensicia, saw the gloating expression on that heart-shaped face, thought: Her doing! The lioness schemes for her cub. This was a game the lioness might live to regret. Returning her attention to Farad\u0027n, Jessica said: \"But the Sisterhood believes you killed him.\" Farad\u0027n turned to his mother. \"Show her the message.\" As Wensicia hesitated, he spoke with an edge of anger which Jessica noted for future use. \"I said show it to her!\" Face pale, Wensicia presented the message face of the cube to Jessica, activated it. Words flowed across the face, responding to Jessica\u0027s eve movements: \"Bene Gesserit Council on Wallach IX files formal protest against House Corrino in assassination of Leto Atreides II. Arguments and showing of evidence are assigned to Landsraad Internal Security Commission. Neutral ground will be chosen and names of judges will be submitted for approval by all parties. Your immediate response required. Sabit Rekush for the Landsraad.\" Wensicia returned to her son\u0027s side. \"How do you intend to respond?\" Jessica asked. Wensicia said: \"Since my son has not yet been formally invested as head of House Corrino, I will - Where are you going?\" This last was addressed to Farad\u0027n who, as she spoke, turned and headed for a side door near the watchful mute. Farad\u0027n paused, half turned. \"I\u0027m going back to my books and the other pursuits which hold much more interest for me.\" \"How dare you?\" Wensicia demanded. A dark flush spread from her neck up across her cheeks. \"I\u0027ll dare quite a few things in my own name,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"You have made decisions in my name, decisions which I find extremely distasteful. Either I will make the decisions in my own name from this point on or you can find yourself another heir for House Corrino!\" Jessica passed her gaze swiftly across the participants in this confrontation, seeing the real anger in Farad\u0027n. The Bashar Aide stood stiffly at attention, trying to make it appear that he had heard nothing. Wensicia hesitated on the brink of screaming rage. Farad\u0027n appeared perfectly willing to accept any outcome from his throw of the dice. Jessica rather admired his poise, seeing many things in this confrontation which could be of value to her. It seemed that the decision to send assassin tigers against her grandchildren had been made without Farad\u0027n\u0027s knowledge. There could be little doubt of his truthfulness in saying he\u0027d learned of the plot after its inception. There was no mistaking the real anger in his eyes as he stood there, ready to accept any decision. Wensicia took a deep, trembling breath. Then: \"Very well. The formal investiture will take place tomorrow. You may act in advance of it now.\" She looked at Tyekanik, who refused to meet her gaze. There\u0027ll be a screaming fight once mother and son get out of here, Jessica thought. But I do believe he has won. She allowed her thoughts to return then to the message from the Landsraad. The Sisterhood had judged their messengers with a finesse which did credit to Bene Gesserit planning. Hidden in the formal notice of protest was a message for Jessica\u0027s eyes. The fact of the message said the Sisterhood\u0027s spies knew Jessica\u0027s situation and they\u0027d gauged Farad\u0027n with a superb nicety to guess he\u0027d show it to his captive. \"I\u0027d like an answer to my question,\" Jessica said, addressing herself to Farad\u0027n as he returned to face her. \"I shall tell the Landsraad that I had nothing to do with this assassination,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"I will add that I share the Sisterhood\u0027s distaste for the manner of it, although I cannot be completely displeased at the outcome. My apologies for any grief this may have caused you. Fortune passes everywhere.\" Fortune passes everywhere! Jessica thought. That\u0027d been a favorite saying of her Duke, and there\u0027d been something in Farad\u0027n\u0027s manner which said he knew this. She forced herself to ignore the possibility that they\u0027d really killed Leto. She had to assume that Ghanima\u0027s fears for Leto had motivated a complete revelation of the twins\u0027 plan. The smugglers would put Gurney in position to meet Leto then and the Sisterhood\u0027s devices would be carried out. Leto had to be tested. He had to be. Without the testing he was doomed as Alia was doomed. And Ghanima... Well, that could be faced later. There was no way to send the pre-born before a Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.
