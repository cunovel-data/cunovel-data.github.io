{"id":97146,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"As the ornithopter\u0027s wings dipped and the craft went skidding into the air, she felt the pomp and power of her position as physical things - but they were fragile, oh, how fragile! Why now, when her plans were not completed? The dust mists drifted, lifting, and she could see the bright sunlight upon the changing landscape of the planet: broad reaches of green vegetation where parched earth had once dominated. Without a vision of the future, I could fail. Oh, what magic I could perform if only I could see as Paul saw! Not for me the bitterness which prescient visions brought. A tormenting hunger shuddered through her and she wished she could put aside the power. Oh, to be as others were - blind in that safest of all blindnesses, living only the hypnoidal half-life into which birth-shock precipitated most humans. But no! She had been born an Atreides, victim of that eons-deep awareness inflicted by her mother\u0027s spice addiction. Why does my mother return today? Gurney Halleck would be with her - ever the devoted servant, the hired killer of ugly mien, loyal and straightforward, a musician who played murder with a sliptip, or entertained with equal ease upon his nine-string baliset. Some said he\u0027d become her mother\u0027s lover. That would be a thing to ferret out; it might prove a most valuable leverage. The wish to be as others were left her. Leto must be lured into the spice trance. She recalled asking the boy how he would deal with Gurney Halleck. And Leto, sensing undercurrents in her question, had said Halleck was loyal \"to a fault,\" adding: \"He adored... my father.\" She\u0027d noted the small hesitation. Leto had almost said \"me\" instead of \"my father.\" Yes, it was hard at times to separate the genetic memory from the chord of living flesh. Gurney Halleck would not make that separation easier for Leto. A harsh smile touched Alia\u0027s lips. Gurney had chosen to return to Caladan with the Lady Jessica after Paul\u0027s death. His return would tangle many things. Coming back to Arrakis, he would add his own complexities to the existing lines. He had served Paul\u0027s father - and thus the succession went: Leto I to Paul to Leto II. And out of the Bene Gesserit breeding program: Jessica to Alia to Ghanima - a branching line. Gurney, adding to the confusion of identities, might prove valuable. What would he do if he discovered we carry the blood of Harkonnens, the Harkonnens he hates so bitterly? The smile on Alia\u0027s lips became introspective. The twins were, after all, children. They were like children with countless parents, whose memories belonged both to others and to self. They would stand at the lip of Sietch Tabr and watch the track of their grandmother\u0027s ship landing in the Arrakeen Basin. That burning mark of a ship\u0027s passage visible on the sky - would it make Jessica\u0027s arrival more real for her grandchildren? My mother will ask me about their training, Alia thought. Do I mix prana bindu disciplines with a judicious hand? And I will tell her that they train themselves - just as I did. I will quote her grandson to her: \"Among the responsibilities of command is the necessity to punish... but only when the victim demands it.\" It came to Alia then that if she could only focus the Lady Jessica\u0027s attention sharply enough onto the twins, others might escape a closer inspection. Such a thing could be done. Leto was very much like Paul. And why not? He could be Paul whenever he chose. Even Ghanima possessed this shattering ability. Just as I can be my mother or any of the others who\u0027ve shared their lives with us. She veered away from this thought, staring out at the passing landscape of the Shield Wall. Then: How was it to leave the warm safety of water-rich Caladan and return to Arrakis, to this desert planet where her Duke was murdered and her son died a martyr? Why did the Lady Jessica come back at this time? Alia found no answer - nothing certain. She could share another\u0027s ego-awareness, but when experiences went their separate ways, then motives diverged as well. The stuff of decisions lay in the private actions taken by individuals. For the pre-born, the many-born Atreides, this remained the paramount reality, in itself another kind of birth: it was the absolute separation of living, breathing flesh when that flesh left the womb which had afflicted it with multiple awareness. Alia saw nothing strange in loving and hating her mother simultaneously. It was a necessity, a required balance without room for guilt or blame. Where could loving or hating stop? Was one to blame the Bene Gesserit because they set the Lady Jessica upon a certain course? Guilt and blame grew diffuse when memory covered millennia. The Sisterhood had only been seeking to breed a Kwisatz Haderach: the male counterpart of a fully developed Reverend Mother... and more - a human of superior sensitivity and awareness, the Kwisatz Haderach who could be many places simultaneously. And the Lady Jessica, merely a pawn in that breeding program, had the bad taste to fall in love with the breeding partner to whom she had been assigned. Responsive to her beloved Duke\u0027s wishes, she produced a son instead of the daughter which the Sisterhood had commanded as the firstborn. Leaving me to be born after she became addicted to the spice! And now they don\u0027t want me. Now they fear me! With good reason... They\u0027d achieved Paul, their Kwisatz Haderach, one lifetime too early - a minor miscalculation in a plan that extended. And now they had another problem: the Abomination, who carried the precious genes they\u0027d sought for so many generations. Alia felt a shadow pass across her, glanced upward. Her escort was assuming the high guard position preparatory to landing. She shook her head in wonderment at her wandering thoughts. What good was served by calling up old lifetimes and rubbing their mistakes together? This was a new lifetime. Duncan Idaho had put his mentat awareness to the question of why Jessica returned at this time, evaluating the problem in the human-computer fashion which was his gift. He said she returned to take over the twins for the Sisterhood. The twins, too, carried those precious genes. Duncan could well be right. That might be enough to take the Lady Jessica out of her self-imposed seclusion on Caladan. If the Sisterhood commanded... Well, why else would she come back to the scenes of so much that must be shatteringly painful to her? \"We shall see,\" Alia muttered. She felt the ornithopter touch down on the roof of her Keep, a positive and jarring punctuation which filled her with grim anticipation. melange (me\u0027-lange also ma,lanj) n-s, origin uncertain (thought to derive from ancient Terran Franzh): a. mixture of spices; b. spice of Arrakis (Dune) with geriatric properties first noted by Yanshuph Ashkoko, royal chemist in reign of Shakkad the Wise; Arrakeen melange, found only in deepest desert sands of Arrakis, linked to prophetic visions of Paul Muad\u0027Dib (Atreides), first Fremen Mahdi; also employed by Spacing Guild Navigators and the Bene Gesserit. -Dictionary Royal fifth edition The two big cats came over the rocky ridge in the dawn light, loping easily. They were not really into the passionate hunt as yet, merely looking over their territory. They were called Laza tigers, a special breed brought here to the planet Salusa Secundus almost eight thousand years past. Genetic manipulation of the ancient Terran stock had erased some of the original tiger features and refined other elements. The fangs remained long. Their faces were wide, eyes alert and intelligent. The paws were enlarged to give them support on uneven terrain and their sheathed claws could extend some ten centimeters, sharpened at the ends into razor tips by abrasive compression of the sheath. Their coats were a flat and even tan which made them almost invisible against sand. They differed in another way from their ancestors: servo-stimulators had been implanted in their brains while they were cubs. The stimulators made them pawns of whoever possessed the transmitter. It was cold and as the cats paused to scan the terrain, their breath made fog on the air. Around them lay a region of Salusa Secundus left sere and barren, a place which harbored a scant few sandtrout smuggled from Arrakis and kept precariously alive in the dream that the melange monopoly might be broken. Where the cats stood, the landscape was marked by tan rocks and a scattering of sparse bushes, silvery green in the long shadows of the morning sun. Without the slightest movement the cats grew suddenly alert. Their eyes turned slowly left, then their heads turned. Far down in the scarred land two children struggled up a dry wash, hand in hand. The children appeared to be of an age, perhaps nine or ten standard years. They were red-haired and wore stillsuits partly covered by rich white bourkas which bore all around the hem and at the forehead the hawk crest of the House Atreides worked in flame-jewel threads. As they walked, the children chattered happily and their voices carried clearly to the hunting cats. The Laza tigers knew this game; they had played it before, but they remained quiescent, awaiting the triggering of the chase signal in their servo-stimulators. Now a man appeared on the ridgetop behind the cats. He stopped and surveyed the scene: cats, children. The man wore a Sardaukar working uniform in grey and black with insignia of a Levenbrech, aide to a Bashar. A harness passed behind his neck and under his arms to carry the servo-transmitter in a thin package against his chest where the keys could be reached easily by either hand. The cats did not turn at his approach. They knew this man by sound and smell. He scrambled down to stop two paces from the cats, mopped his forehead. The air was cold, but this was hot work. Again his pale eyes surveyed the scene: cats, children. He pushed a damp strand of blond hair back under his black working helmet, touched the implanted microphone in his throat. \"The cats have them in sight.\" The answering voice came to him through receivers implanted behind each ear. \"We see them.\" \"This time?\" the Levenbrech asked. \"Will they do it without a chase command?\" the voice countered. \"They\u0027re ready,\" the Levenbrech said. \"Very well. Let us see if four conditioning sessions will be enough.\" \"Tell me when you\u0027re ready.\" \"Any time.\" \"Now, then,\" the Levenbrech said. He touched a red key on the right hand side of his servo-transmitter, first releasing a bar which shielded the key. Now the cats stood without any transmitted restraints. He held his hand over a black key below the red one, ready to stop the animals should they turn on him. But they took no notice of him, crouched, and began working their way down the ridge toward the children. Their great paws slid out in smooth gliding motions. The Levenbrech squatted to observe, knowing that somewhere around him a hidden transeye carried this entire scene to a secret monitor within the Keep where his Prince lived. Presently the cats began to lope, then to run. The children, intent on climbing through the rocky terrain, still had not seen their peril. One of them laughed, a high and piping sound in the clear air. The other child stumbled and, recovering balance, turned and saw the cats. The child pointed. \"Look!\" Both children stopped and stared at the interesting intrusion into their lives. They were still standing when the Laza tigers hit them, one cat to each child. The children died with a casual abruptness, necks broken swiftly. The cats began to feed. \"Shall I recall them?\" the Levenbrech asked. \"Let them finish. They did well. I knew they would; this pair is superb.\" \"Best I\u0027ve ever seen,\" the Levenbrech agreed. \"Very good, then. Transport is being sent for you. We will sign off now.\" The Levenbrech stood and stretched. He refrained from looking directly off to the high ground on his left where a telltale glitter had revealed the location of the transeye, which had relayed his fine performance to his Bashar far away in the green lands of the Capitol. The Levenbrech smiled. There would be a promotion for this day\u0027s work. Already he could feel a Bator\u0027s insignia at his neck - and someday, Burseg... Even, one day, Bashar. People who served well in the corps of Farad\u0027n, grandson of the late Shaddam IV, earned rich promotions. One day, when the Prince was seated on his rightful throne, there would be even greater promotions. A Bashar\u0027s rank might not be the end of it. There were Baronies and Earldoms to be had on the many worlds of this realm... once the twin Atreides were removed. The Fremen must return to his original faith, to his genius in forming human communities; he must return to the past, where that lesson of survival was learned in the struggle with Arrakis. The only business of the Fremen should be that of opening his soul to the inner teachings. The worlds of the Imperium, the Landsraad and the CHOAM Confederacy have no message to give him. They will only rob him of his soul. -The Preacher at Arrakeen All around the Lady Jessica, reaching far out into the dun flatness of the landing plain upon which her transport rested, crackling and sighing after its dive from space, stood an ocean of humanity. She estimated half a million people were there and perhaps only a third of them pilgrims. They stood in awesome silence, attention fixed on the transport\u0027s exit platform, whose shadowy hatchway concealed her and her party. It lacked two hours until noon, but already the air above that throng reflected a dusty shimmering in promise of the day\u0027s heat. Jessica touched her silver-flecked copper hair where it framed her oval face beneath the aba hood of a Reverend Mother. She knew she did not look her best after the long trip, and the black of the aba was not her best color. But she had worn this garment here before. The significance of the aba robe would not be lost upon the Fremen. She sighed. Space travel did not agree with her, and there\u0027d been that added burden of memories - the other trip from Caladan to Arrakis when her Duke had been forced into this fief against his better judgment. Slowly, probing with her Bene Gesserit-trained ability to detect significant minutiae, she scanned the sea of people. There were stillsuit hoods of dull grey, garments of Fremen from the deep desert; there were white-robed pilgrims with penitence marks on their shoulders; there were scattered pockets of rich merchants, hoodless in light clothing to flaunt their disdain for water loss in Arrakeen\u0027s parching air... and there was the delegation from the Society of the Faithful, green robed and heavily hooded, standing aloof within the sanctity of their own group. Only when she lifted her gaze from the crowd did the scene take on any similarity to that which had greeted her upon her arrival with her beloved Duke. How long ago had that been? More than twenty years. She did not like to think of those intervening heartbeats. Time lay within her like a dead weight, and it was as though her years away from this planet had never been. Once more into the dragon\u0027s mouth, she thought. Here, upon this plain, her son had wrested the Imperium from the late Shaddam IV. A convulsion of history had imprinted this place into men\u0027s minds and beliefs. She heard the restless stirring of the entourage behind her and again she sighed. They must wait for Alia, who had been delayed. Alia\u0027s party could be seen now approaching from the far edge of the throng, creating a human wave as a wedge of Royal Guards opened a passage. Jessica scanned the landscape once more. Many differences submitted to her searching stare. A prayer balcony had been added to the landing field\u0027s control tower. And visible far off to the left across the plain stood the awesome pile of plasteel which Paul had built as his fortress - his \"sietch above the sand.\" It was the largest integrated single construction ever to rise from the hand of man. Entire cities could have been housed within its walls and room to spare. Now it housed the most powerful governing force in the Imperium, Alia\u0027s \"Society of the Faithful,\" which she had built upon her brother\u0027s body. That place must go, Jessica thought. Alia\u0027s delegation had reached the foot of the exit ramp and stood there expectantly. Jessica recognized Stilgar\u0027s craggy features. And God forfend! There stood the Princess Irulan hiding her savagery in that seductive body with its cap of golden hair exposed by a vagrant breeze. Irulan seemed not to have aged a day; it was an affront. And there, at the point of the wedge, was Alia, her features impudently youthful, her eyes staring upward into the hatchway\u0027s shadows. Jessica\u0027s mouth drew into a straight line and she scanned her daughter\u0027s face. A leaden sensation pulsed through Jessica\u0027s body and she heard the surf of her own life within her ears. The rumors were true! Horrible! Horrible! Alia had fallen into the forbidden way. The evidence was there for the initiate to read. Abomination! In the few moments it took her to recover, Jessica realized how much she had hoped to find the rumors false. What of the twins? she asked herself. Are they lost, too? Slowly, as befitted the mother of a god, Jessica moved out of the shadows and onto the lip of the ramp. Her entourage remained behind as instructed. These next few moments were the crucial ones. Jessica stood alone in full view of the throng. She heard Gurney Halleck cough nervously behind her. Gurney had objected: \"Not even a shield on you? Gods below, woman! You\u0027re insane!\" But among Gurney\u0027s most valuable features was a core of obedience. He would say his piece and then he would obey. Now he obeyed. The human sea emitted a sound like the hiss of a giant sandworm as Jessica emerged. She raised her arms in the benedictory to which the priesthood had conditioned the Imperium. With significant pockets of tardiness, but still like one giant organism, the people sank to their knees. Even the official party complied. Jessica had marked out the places of delay, and she knew that other eyes behind her and among her agents in the throng had memorized a temporary map with which to seek out the tardy. As Jessica remained with her arms upraised, Gurney and his men emerged. They moved swiftly past her down the ramp, ignoring the official party\u0027s startled looks, joining the agents who identified themselves by handsign. Quickly they fanned out through the human sea, leaping knots of kneeling figures, dashing through narrow lanes. A few of their targets saw the danger and tried to flee. They were the easiest: a thrown knife, a garrote loop and the runners went down. Others were herded out of the press, hands bound, feet hobbled. Through it all, Jessica stood with arms outstretched, blessing by her presence, keeping the throng subservient. She read the signs of spreading rumors though, and knew the dominant one because it had been planted: \"The Reverend Mother returns to weed out the slackers. Bless the mother of our Lord!\" When it was over - a few dead bodies sprawled on the sand, captives removed to holding pens beneath the landing tower - Jessica lowered her arms. Perhaps three minutes had elapsed. She knew there was little likelihood Gurney and his men had taken any of the ringleaders, the ones who posed the most potent threat. They would be the alert and sensitive ones. But the captives would contain some interesting fish as well as the usual culls and dullards. Jessica lowered her arms and, cheering, the people surged to their feet. As though nothing untoward had happened, Jessica walked alone down the ramp, avoiding her daughter, singling out Stilgar for concentrated attention. The black beard which fanned out across the neck of his stillsuit hood like a wild delta contained flecks of grey, but his eyes carried that same whiteless intensity they\u0027d presented to her on their first encounter in the desert. Stilgar knew what had just occurred, and approved. Here stood a true Fremen Naib, a leader of men and capable of bloody decisions. His first words were completely in character. \"Welcome home, My Lady. It\u0027s always a pleasure to see direct and effective action.\" Jessica allowed herself a tiny smile. \"Close the port, Stil. No one leaves until we\u0027ve questioned those we took.\" \"It\u0027s already done, My Lady,\" Stilgar said. \"Gurney\u0027s man and I planned this together.\" \"Those were your men, then, the ones who helped.\" \"Some of them, My Lady.\" She read the hidden reservations, nodded. \"You studied me pretty well in those old days, Stil.\" \"As you once were at pains to tell me, My Lady, one observes the survivors and learns from them.\" Alia stepped forward then and Stilgar stood aside while Jessica confronted her daughter. Knowing there was no way to hide what she had learned, Jessica did not even try concealment. Alia could read the minutiae when she needed, could read as well as any adept of the Sisterhood. She would already know by Jessica\u0027s behavior what had been seen and interpreted. They were enemies for whom the word mortal touched only the surface. Alia chose anger as the easiest and most proper reaction. \"How dare you plan an action such as this without consulting me?\" she demanded, pushing her face close to Jessica\u0027s. Jessica spoke mildly: \"As you\u0027ve just heard, Gurney didn\u0027t even let me in on the whole plan. It was thought...\" \"And you, Stilgar!\" Alia said, rounding on him. \"To whom are you loyal?\" \"My oath is to Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s children,\" Stilgar said, speaking stiffly. \"We have removed a threat to them.\" \"And why doesn\u0027t that fill you with joy... daughter?\" Jessica asked. Alia blinked, glanced once at her mother, suppressed the inner tempest, and even managed a straight-toothed smile. \"I am filled with joy... mother,\" she said. And to her own surprise, Alia found that she was happy, experiencing a terrible delight that it was all out in the open at last between herself and her mother. The moment she had dreaded was past and the power balance had not really been changed. \"We will discuss this in more detail at a more convenient time,\" Alia said, speaking both to her mother and Stilgar. \"But of course,\" Jessica said, turning with a movement of dismissal to face the Princess Irulan. For a few brief heartbeats, Jessica and the Princess stood silently studying each other - two Bene Gesserits who had broken with the Sisterhood for the same reason: love... both of them for love of men who now were dead. This Princess had loved Paul in vain, becoming his wife but not his mate. And now she lived only for the children given to Paul by his Fremen concubine, Chani. Jessica spoke first: \"Where are my grandchildren?\" \"At Sietch Tabr.\" \"Too dangerous for them here; I understand.\" Irulan permitted herself a faint nod. She had observed the interchange between Jessica and Alia, but put upon it an interpretation for which Alia had prepared her. \"Jessica has returned to the Sisterhood and we both know they have plans for Paul\u0027s children.\" Irulan had never been the most accomplished adept in the Bene Gesserit - valuable more for the fact that she was a daughter of Shaddam IV than for any other reason; often too proud to exert herself in extending her capabilities. Now she chose sides with an abruptness which did no credit to her training. \"Really, Jessica,\" Irulan said, \"the Royal Council should have been consulted. It was wrong of you to work only through -\" \"Am I to believe none of you trust Stilgar?\" Jessica asked. Irulan possessed the wit to realize there could be no answer to such a question. She was glad that the priestly delegates, unable to contain their impatience any longer, pressed forward. She exchanged a glance with Alia, thinking: Jessica\u0027s as haughty and certain of herself as ever! A Bene Gesserit axiom arose unbidden in her mind, though: \"The haughty do but build castle walls behind which they try to hide their doubts and fears.\" Could that be true of Jessica? Surely not. Then it must be a pose. But for what purpose? The question disturbed Irulan. The priests were noisy in their possession of Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s mother. Some only touched her arms, but most bowed low and spoke greetings. At last the leaders of the delegation took their turn with the Most Holy Reverend Mother, accepting the ordained role - \"The first shall be last\" - with practiced smiles, telling her that the official Lustration ceremony awaited her at the Keep, Paul\u0027s old fortress-stronghold. Jessica studied the pair, finding them repellent. One was called Javid, a young man of surly features and round cheeks, shadowed eyes which could not hide the suspicions lurking in their depths. The other was Zebataleph, second son of a Naib she\u0027d known in her Fremen days, as he was quick to remind her. He was easily classified: jollity linked with ruthlessness, a thin face with blond beard, an air about him of secret excitements and powerful knowledge. Javid she judged far more dangerous of the two, a man of private counsel, simultaneously magnetic and - she could find no other word - repellent. She found his accents strange, full of old Fremen pronunciations, as though he\u0027d come from some isolated pocket of his people. \"Tell me, Javid,\" she said, \"whence come you?\" \"I am but a simple Fremen of the desert,\" he said, every syllable giving the lie to the statement. Zebataleph intruded with an offensive deference, almost mocking: \"We have much to discuss of the old days, My Lady. I was one of the first, you know, to recognize the holy nature of your son\u0027s mission.\" \"But you weren\u0027t one of his Fedaykin,\" she said. \"No, My Lady. I possessed a more philosophic bent; I studied for the priesthood.\" And insured the preservation of your skin, she thought. Javid said: \"They await us at the Keep, My Lady.\" Again she found the strangeness of his accent an open question demanding an answer. \"Who awaits us?\" she asked. \"The Convocation of the Faith, all those who keep bright the name and the deeds of your holy son,\" Javid said. Jessica glanced around her, saw Alia smiling at Javid, asked: \"Is this man one of your appointees, daughter?\" Alia nodded. \"A man destined for great deeds.\" But Jessica saw that Javid had no pleasure in this attention, marked him for Gurney\u0027s special study. And there came Gurney with five trusted men, signaling that they had the suspicious laggards under interrogation. He walked with the rolling stride of a powerful man, glance flicking left, right, all around, every muscle flowing through the relaxed alertness she had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit prana-bindu manual. He was an ugly lump of trained reflexes, a killer, and altogether terrifying to some, but Jessica loved him and prized him above all other living men. The scar of an inkvine whip rippled along his jaw, giving him a sinister appearance, but a smile softened his face as he saw Stilgar. \"Well done, Stil,\" he said. And they gripped arms in the Fremen fashion. \"The Lustration,\" Javid said, touching Jessica\u0027s arm. Jessica drew back, chose her words carefully in the controlled power of Voice, her tone and delivery calculated for a precise emotional effect upon Javid and Zebataleph: \"I returned to Dune to see my grandchildren. Must we take time for this priestly nonsense?\" Zebataleph reacted with shock, his mouth dropping open, eyes alarmed, glancing about at those who had heard. The eyes marked each listener. Priestly nonsense! What effect would such words have, coming from the mother of their messiah? Javid, however, confirmed Jessica\u0027s assessment. His mouth hardened, then smiled. The eyes did not smile, nor did they waver to mark the listeners. Javid already knew each member of this party. He had an earshot map of those who would be watched with special care from this point onward. Only seconds later, Javid stopped smiling with an abruptness which said he knew how he had betrayed himself. Javid had not failed to do his homework: he knew the observational powers possessed by the Lady Jessica. A short, jerking nod of his head acknowledged those powers. In a lightning flash of mentation, Jessica weighed the necessities. A subtle hand signal to Gurney would bring Javid\u0027s death. It could be done here for effect, or in quiet later, and be made to appear an accident. She thought: When we try to conceal our innermost drives, the entire being screams betrayal. Bene Gesserit training turned upon this revelation - raising the adepts above it and teaching them to read the open flesh of others. She saw Javid\u0027s intelligence as valuable, a temporary weight in the balance. If he could be won over, he could be the link she needed, the line into the Arrakeen priesthood. And he was Alia\u0027s man. Jessica said: \"My official party must remain small. We have room for one addition, however. Javid, you will join us. Zebataleph, I am sorry. And, Javid... I will attend this - this ceremony - if you insist.\" Javid allowed himself a deep breath and a low-voiced \"As Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s mother commands.\" He glanced to Alia, to Zebataleph, back to Jessica. \"It pains me to delay the reunion with your grandchildren, but there are, ahhh, reasons of state...\" Jessica thought: Good. He\u0027s a businessman above all else. Once we\u0027ve determined the proper coinage, we\u0027ll buy him. And she found herself enjoying the fact that he insisted on his precious ceremony. This little victory would give him power with his fellows, and they both knew it. Accepting his Lustration could be a down payment on later services. \"I presume you\u0027ve arranged transportation,\" she said. I give you the desert chameleon, whose ability to blend itself into the background tells you all you need to know about the roots of ecology and the foundations of a personal identity. -Book of Diatribes from the Hayt Chronicle Leto sat playing a small baliset which had been sent to him on his fifth birthday by that consummate artist of the instrument, Gurney Halleck. In four years of practice, Leto had achieved a certain fluency, although the two bass side strings still gave him trouble. He had found the baliset soothing, however, for particular feelings of upset - a fact which had not escaped Ghanima. He sat now in twilight on a rock shelf at the southernmost extremity of the craggy outcropping which sheltered Sietch Tabr. Softly he strummed the baliset. Ghanima stood behind him, her small figure radiating protest. She had not wanted to come here into the open after learning from Stilgar that their grandmother was delayed in Arrakeen. She particularly objected to coming here with nightfall near. Attempting to hurry her brother, she asked: \"Well, what is it?\" For an answer, he began another tune. For the first time since accepting the gift, Leto felt intensely aware that this baliset had originated with a master craftsman on Caladan. He possessed inherited memories which could inflict him with profound nostalgia for that beautiful planet where House Atreides had ruled. Leto had but to relax his inner barriers in the presence of this music and he would hear memories from those times when Gurney had employed the baliset to beguile his friend and charge, Paul Atreides. With the baliset sounding in his own hands, Leto felt himself more and more dominated by his father\u0027s psychical presence. Still he played, relating more strongly to the instrument with every second that passed. He sensed the absolute idealized summation within himself which knew how to play this baliset, though nine-year-old muscles had not yet been conditioned to that inner awareness. Ghanima tapped her foot impatiently, unaware that she matched the rhythm of her brother\u0027s playing. Setting his mouth in a grimace of concentration, Leto broke from the familiar music and tried a song more ancient than any even Gurney had played. It had been old when Fremen migrated to their fifth planet. The words echoed a Zensunni theme, and he heard them in his memory while his fingers elicited a faltering version of the tune. \"Nature\u0027s beauteous form Contains a lovely essence Called by some - decay. By this lovely presence New life finds its way. Tears shed silently Are but water of the soul: They bring new life To the pain of being - A separation from that seeing Which death makes whole.\" Ghanima spoke behind him as he strummed the final note. \"There\u0027s a mucky old song. Why that one?\" \"Because it fits.\" \"Will you play it for Gurney?\" \"Perhaps.\" \"He\u0027ll call it moody nonsense.\" \"I know.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-2.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
