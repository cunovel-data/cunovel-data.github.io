He had no particular datum to reinforce an argument based on mentat computation, but he knew. He knew. This thing he\u0027d experienced came very close to the visionary power which Paul had known. Neither Irulan nor Alia would believe it, coming from him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to alert the port authorities against allowing the importation of any outside animals,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not taking Irulan\u0027s suggestion seriously,\" Alia protested.\\n\\n \"Why take any chances?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Tell that to the smugglers,\" Alia said. \"I\u0027ll put my dependence on the House ferrets.\"\\n\\n Idaho shook his head. What could House ferrets do against claws the size of those he envisioned? But Alia was right. Bribes in the right places, one acquiescent Guild navigator, and anyplace in the Empty Quarter became a landing port. The Guild would resist a front position in any attack on House Atreides, but if the price were high enough... Well, the Guild could only be thought of as something like a geological barrier which made attacks difficult, but not impossible. They could always protest that they were just \"a transportation agency.\" How could they know to what use a particular cargo would be put?\\n\\n Alia broke the silence with a purely Fremen gesture, a raised fist with thumb horizontal. She accompanied the gesture with a traditional expletive which meant, \"I give Typhoon Conflict.\" She obviously saw herself as the only logical target for assassins, and the gesture protested a universe full of undigested threats. She was saying she would hurl the death wind at anyone who attacked her.\\n\\n Idaho felt the hopelessness of any protest. He saw that she no longer suspected him. He was going back to Tabr and she expected a perfectly executed abduction of the Lady Jessica. He lifted himself from the divan in an adrenaline surge of anger, thinking: If only Alia were the target! If only assassins could get to her! For an instant, he rested his hand on his own knife, but it was not in him to do this. Far better, though, that she die a martyr than live to be discredited and bounded into a sandy grave.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Alia said, misinterpreting his expression as concern for her. \"You\u0027d best hurry back to Tabr.\" And she thought: How foolish of me to suspect Duncan! He\u0027s mine, not Jessica\u0027s! It had been the demand from the tribes that\u0027d upset her, Alia thought. She waved an airy goodbye to Idaho as he left.\\n\\n Idaho left the Council Chamber feeling hopeless. Not only was Alia blind with her alien possession, but she became more insane with each crisis. She\u0027d already passed her danger point and was doomed. But what could be done for the twins? Whom could he convince? Stilgar? And what could Stilgar do that he wasn\u0027t already doing?\\n\\n The Lady Jessica, then?\\n\\n Yes, he\u0027d explore that possibility - but she, too, might be far gone in plotting with her Sisterhood. He carried few illusions about that Atreides concubine. She might do anything at the command of the Bene Gesserits - even turn against her own grandchildren.\\n\\n Good government never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of those who govern. The machinery of government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery. The most important element of government, therefore, is the method of choosing leaders. -Law and Governance, The Spacing Guild Manual\\n\\n Why does Alia wish me to share the morning audience? Jessica wondered. They\u0027ve not voted me back into the Council.\\n\\n Jessica stood in the anteroom to the Keep\u0027s Great Hall. The anteroom itself would have been a great hall anywhere other than Arrakis. Following the Atreides lead, buildings in Arrakeen had become ever more gigantic as wealth and power concentrated, and this room epitomized her misgivings. She did not like this anteroom with its tiled floor depicting her son\u0027s victory over Shaddam IV.\\n\\n She caught a reflection of her own face in the polished plasteel door which led into the Great Hall. Returning to Dune forced such comparisons upon her, and Jessica noted only the signs of aging in her own features: the oval face had developed tiny lines and the eyes were more brittle in their indigo reflection. She could remember when there had been white around the blue of her eyes. Only the careful ministrations of a professional dresser maintained the polished bronze of her hair. Her nose remained small, mouth generous, and her body was still slender, but even the Bene Gesserit-trained muscles had a tendency toward slowing with the passage of time. Some might not note this and say: \"You haven\u0027t changed a bit!\" But the Sisterhood\u0027s training was a two-edged sword; small changes seldom escaped the notice of people thus trained.\\n\\n And the lack of small changes in Alia had not escaped Jessica\u0027s notice.\\n\\n Javid, the master of Alia\u0027s appointments, stood at the great door, being very official this morning. He was a robed genie with a cynical smile on his round face. Javid struck Jessica as a paradox: a well-fed Fremen. Noting her attention upon him, Javid smiled knowingly, shrugged. His attendance in Jessica\u0027s entourage had been short, as he\u0027d known it would be. He hated Atreides, but he was Alia\u0027s man in more ways than one, if the rumors were to be believed,\\n\\n Jessica saw the shrug, thought: This is the age of the shrug. He knows I\u0027ve heard all the stories about him and he doesn\u0027t care. Our civilization could well die of indifference within it before succumbing to external attack.\\n\\n The guards Gurney had assigned her before leaving for the smugglers and the desert hadn\u0027t liked her coming here without their attendance. But Jessica felt oddly safe. Let someone make a martyr of her in this place; Alia wouldn\u0027t survive it. Alia would know that.\\n\\n When Jessica failed to respond to his shrug and smile, Javid coughed, a belching disturbance of his larynx which could only have been achieved with practice. It was like a secret language. It said: \"We understand the nonsense of all this pomp, My Lady. Isn\u0027t it wonderful what humans can be made to believe!\"\\n\\n Wonderful! Jessica agreed, but her face gave no indication of the thought.\\n\\n The anteroom was quite full now, all of the morning\u0027s permitted supplicants having received their right of entrance from Javid\u0027s people. The outer doors had been closed. Supplicants and attendants kept a polite distance from Jessica, but observed that she wore the formal black aba of a Fremen Reverend Mother. This would raise many questions. No mark of Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s priesthood could be seen on her person. Conversations hummed as the people divided their attention between Jessica and the small side door through which Alia would come to lead them into the Great Hall. It was obvious to Jessica that the old pattern which defined where the Regency\u0027s powers lay had been shaken.\\n\\n I did that just by coming here, she thought. But I came because Alia invited me.\\n\\n Reading the signs of disturbance, Jessica realized Alia was deliberately prolonging this moment, allowing the subtle currents to run their course here. Alia would be watching from a spy hole, of course. Few subtleties of Alia\u0027s behavior escaped Jessica, and she felt with each passing minute how right she\u0027d been to accept the mission which the Sisterhood had pressed upon her.\\n\\n \"Matters cannot be allowed to continue in this way,\" the leader of the Bene Gesserit delegation had argued. \"Surely the signs of decay have not escaped you - you of all people! We know why you left us, but we know also how you were trained. Nothing was stinted in your education. You are an adept of the Panoplia Prophetica and you must know when the souring of a powerful religion threatens us all.\"\\n\\n Jessica had pursed her lips in thought while staring out a window at the soft signs of spring at Castle Caladan. She did not like to direct her thinking in such a logical fashion. One of the first lessons of the Sisterhood had been to reserve an attitude of questioning distrust for anything which came in the guise of logic. But the members of the delegation had known that, too.\\n\\n How moist the air had been that morning, Jessica thought, looking around Alia\u0027s anteroom. How fresh and moist. Here there was a sweaty dampness to the air which evoked a sense of uneasiness in Jessica, and she thought: I\u0027ve reverted to Fremen ways. The air was too moist in this sietch-above-ground. What was wrong with the Master of the Stills? Paul would never have permitted such laxness.\\n\\n She noted that Javid, his shiny face alert and composed, appeared not to have noticed the fault of dampness in the anteroom\u0027s air. Bad training for one born on Arrakis.\\n\\n The members of the Bene Gesserit delegation had wanted to know if she required proofs of their allegations. She\u0027d given them an angry answer out of their own manuals: \"All proofs inevitably lead to propositions which have no proof! All things are known because we want to believe in them.\"\\n\\n \"But we have submitted these questions to mentats,\" the delegation\u0027s leader had protested.\\n\\n Jessica had stared at the woman, astonished. \"I marvel that you have reached your present station and not yet learned the limits of mentats,\" Jessica had said.\\n\\n At which the delegation had relaxed. Apparently it had all been a test, and she had passed. They\u0027d feared, of course, that she had lost all touch with those balancing abilities which were at the core of Bene Gesserit training.\\n\\n Now Jessica became softly alert as Javid left his door station and approached her. He bowed. \"My Lady. It occurred to me that you might not\u0027ve heard the latest exploit of The Preacher.\"\\n\\n \"I get daily reports on everything which occurs here,\" Jessica said. Let him take that back to Alia!\\n\\n Javid smiled. \"Then you know he rails against your family. Only last night, he preached in the south suburb and no one dared touch him. You know why, of course.\"\\n\\n \"Because they think he\u0027s my son come back to them,\" Jessica said, her voice bored.\\n\\n \"This question has not yet been put to the mentat Idaho,\" Javid said. \"Perhaps that should be done and the thing settled.\"\\n\\n Jessica thought: Here\u0027s one who truly doesn\u0027t know a mentat\u0027s limits, although he dares put horns on one - in his dreams if not in fact.\\n\\n \"Mentats share the fallibilities of those who use them,\" she said. \"The human mind, as is the case with the mind of any animal, is a resonator. It responds to resonances in the environment. The mentat has learned to extend his awareness across many parallel loops of causality and to proceed along those loops for long chains of consequences.\" Let him chew on that!\\n\\n \"This Preacher doesn\u0027t disturb you, then?\" Javid asked, his voice abruptly formal and portentous.\\n\\n \"I find him a healthy sign,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want him bothered.\"\\n\\n Javid clearly had not expected that blunt a response. He tried to smile, failed. Then: \"The ruling Council of the church which deifies thy son will, of course, bow to your wishes if you insist. But certainly some explanation -\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps you\u0027d rather I explained how I fit into your schemes,\" she said.\\n\\n Javid stared at her narrowly. \"Madame, I see no logical reason why thou refusest to denounce this Preacher. He cannot be thy son. I make a reasonable request: denounce him.\"\\n\\n This is a set piece, Jessica thought. Alia put him up to it.\\n\\n She said: \"No.\"\\n\\n \"But he defiles the name of thy son! He preaches abominable things, cries out against thy holy daughter. He incites the populace against us. When asked, he said that even thou possessest the nature of evil and that thy -\"\\n\\n \"Enough of this nonsense!\" Jessica said. \"Tell Alia that I refuse. I\u0027ve heard nothing but tales of this Preacher since returning. He bores me.\"\\n\\n \"Does it bore thee, Madame, to learn that in his latest defilement he has said that thou wilt not turn against him? And here, clearly, thou -\"\\n\\n \"Evil as I am, I still won\u0027t denounce him,\" she said.\\n\\n \"It is no joking matter, Madame!\"\\n\\n Jessica waved him away angrily. \"Begone!\" She spoke with sufficient carrying power that others heard, forcing him to obey.\\n\\n His eyes glared with rage, but he managed a stiff bow and returned to his position at the door.\\n\\n This argument fitted neatly into the observations Jessica already had made. When he spoke of Alia, Javid\u0027s voice carried the husky undertones of a lover; no mistaking it. The rumors no doubt were true. Alia had allowed her life to degenerate in a terrible way. Observing this, Jessica began to harbor the suspicion that Alia was a willing participant in Abomination. Was it a perverse will to self-destruction? Because surely Alia was working to destroy herself and the power base which fed on her brother\u0027s teachings.\\n\\n Faint stirrings of unease began to grow apparent in the anteroom. The aficionados of this place would know when Alia delayed too long, and by now they\u0027d all heard about Jessica\u0027s peremptory dismissal of Alia\u0027s favorite.\\n\\n Jessica sighed. She felt that her body had walked into this place with her soul creeping behind. Movements among the courtiers were so transparent! The seeking out of important people was a dance like the wind through a field of cereal stalks. The cultivated inhabitants of this place furrowed their brows and gave pragmatic rating numbers to the importance of each of their fellows. Obviously her rebuff of Javid had hurt him; few spoke to him now. But the others! Her trained eye could read the rating numbers in the satellites attending the powerful.\\n\\n They do not attend me because I am dangerous, she thought. I have the stink of someone Alia fears.\\n\\n Jessica glanced around the room, seeing eyes turn away. They were such seriously futile people that she found herself wanting to cry out against their ready-made justifications for pointless lives. Oh, if only The Preacher could see this room as it looked now!\\n\\n A fragment of a nearby conversation caught her attention. A tall, slender Priest was addressing his coterie, no doubt supplicants here under his auspices. \"Often I must speak otherwise than I think,\" he said. \"This is called diplomacy.\"\\n\\n The resultant laughter was too loud, too quickly silenced. People in the group saw that Jessica had overheard.\\n\\n My Duke would have transported such a one to the farthest available hellhole! Jessica thought. I\u0027ve returned none too soon.\\n\\n She knew now that she\u0027d lived on faraway Caladan in an insulated capsule which had allowed only the most blatant of Alia\u0027s excesses to intrude. I contributed to my own dream-existence, she thought. Caladan had been something like that insulation provided by a really first-class frigate riding securely in the hold of a Guild heighliner. Only the most violent maneuvers could be felt, and those as mere softened movements.\\n\\n How seductive it is to live in peace, she thought.\\n\\n The more she saw of Alia\u0027s court, the more sympathy Jessica felt for the words reported as coming from this blind Preacher. Yes, Paul might have said such words on seeing what had become of his realm. And Jessica wondered what Gurney had found out among the smugglers.\\n\\n Her first reaction to Arrakeen had been the right one, Jessica realized. On that first ride into the city with Javid, her attention had been caught by armored screens around dwellings, the heavily guarded pathways and alleys, the patient watchers at every turn, the tall walls and indications of deep underground places revealed by thick foundations. Arrakeen had become an ungenerous place, a contained place, unreasonable and self-righteous in its harsh outlines.\\n\\n Abruptly the anteroom\u0027s small side door opened. A vanguard of priestess amazons spewed into the room with Alia shielded behind them, haughty and moving with a confined awareness of real and terrible power. Alia\u0027s face was composed; no emotion betrayed itself as her gaze caught and held her mother\u0027s. But both knew the battle had been joined.\\n\\n At Javid\u0027s command, the giant doors into the great Hall were opened, moving with a silent and inevitable sense of hidden energies.\\n\\n Alia came to her mother\u0027s side as the guards enfolded them.\\n\\n \"Shall we go in now, mother?\" Alia asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s high time,\" Jessica said. And she thought, seeing the sense of gloating in Alia\u0027s eyes: She thinks she can destroy me and remain unscathed! She\u0027s mad!\\n\\n And Jessica wondered if that might not have been what Idaho had wanted. He\u0027d sent a message, but she\u0027d been unable to respond. Such an enigmatic message: \"Danger. Must see you.\" It had been written in a variant of the old Chakobsa where the particular word chosen to denote danger signified a plot.\\n\\n I\u0027ll see him immediately when I return to Tabr, she thought.\\n\\n This is the fallacy of power: ultimately it is effective only in an absolute, a limited universe. But the basic lesson of our relativistic universe is that things change. Any power must always meet a greater power. Paul Muad\u0027Dib taught this lesson to the Sardaukar on the Plains of Arrakeen. His descendants have yet to learn the lesson for themselves. -The Preacher at Arrakeen\\n\\n The first supplicant for the morning audience was a Kadeshian troubadour, a pilgrim of the Hajj whose purse had been emptied by Arrakeen mercenaries. He stood on the water-green stone of the chamber floor with no air of begging about him.\\n\\n Jessica admired his boldness from where she sat with Alia atop the seven-step platform. Identical thrones had been placed here for mother and daughter, and Jessica made particular note of the fact that Alia sat on the right, the masculine position.\\n\\n As for the Kadeshian troubadour, it was obvious that Javid\u0027s people had passed him for just this quality he now displayed, his boldness. The troubadour was expected to provide some entertainment for the courtiers of the Great Hall; it was the payment he\u0027d make in lieu of the money he no longer possessed.\\n\\n From the report of the Priest-Advocate who now pled the troubadour\u0027s case, the Kadeshian had retained only the clothing on his back and the baliset slung over one shoulder on a leather cord.\\n\\n \"He says he was fed a dark drink,\" the Advocate said, barely hiding the smile which sought to twist his lips. \"If it please your Holiness, the drink left him helpless but awake while his purse was cut,\"\\n\\n Jessica studied the troubadour while the Advocate droned on and on with a false subservience, his voice full of mucky morals. The Kadeshian was tall, easily two meters. He had a roving eye which showed intelligent alertness and humor. His golden hair was worn to the shoulders in the style of his planet, and there was a sense of virile strength in the broad chest and neatly tapering body which a grey Hajj robe could not conceal. His name was given as Tagir Mohandis and he was descended from merchant engineers, proud of his ancestry and himself.\\n\\n Alia finally cut off the pleading with a hand wave, spoke without turning: \"The Lady Jessica will render first judgment in honor of her return to us.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, daughter,\" Jessica said, staling the order of ascendancy to all who heard. Daughter! So this Tagir Mohandis was part of their plan. Or was he an innocent dupe? This judgment was designed to open attack on herself, Jessica realized. It was obvious in Alia\u0027s attitude.\\n\\n \"Do you play that instrument well?\" Jessica asked, indicating the nine-string baliset on the troubadour\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \"As well as the Great Gurney Halleck himself!\" Tagir Mohandis spoke loudly for all in the hall to hear, and his words evoked an interested stir among the courtiers.\\n\\n \"You seek the gift of transport money,\" Jessica said. \"Where would that money take you?\"\\n\\n \"To Salusa Secundus and Farad\u0027n\u0027s court,\" Mohandis said. \"I\u0027ve heard he seeks troubadours and minstrels, that he supports the arts and builds a great renaissance of cultivated life around him.\"\\n\\n Jessica refrained from glancing at Alia. They\u0027d known, of course, what Mohandis would ask. She found herself enjoying this byplay. Did they think her unable to meet this thrust?\\n\\n \"Will you play for your passage?\" Jessica asked. \"My terms are Fremen terms. If I enjoy your music, I may keep you here to smooth away my cares; if your music offends me, I may send you to toil in the desert for your passage money. If I deem your playing just right for Farad\u0027n, who is said to be an enemy of the Atreides, then I will send you to him with my blessing. Will you play on these terms, Tagir Mohandis?\"\\n\\n He threw his head back in a great roaring laugh. His blond hair danced as he unslung the baliset and tuned it deftly to indicate acceptance of her challenge.\\n\\n The crowd in the chamber started to press closer, but were held back by courtiers and guards.\\n\\n Presently Mohandis strummed a note, holding the bass hum of the side strings with a fine attention to their compelling vibration. Then, lifting his voice in a mellow tenor, he sang, obviously improvising, but his touch so deft that Jessica was enthralled before she focused on his lyrics:\\n\\n \"You say you long for Caladan seas,\\n\\n Where once you ruled, Atreides,\\n\\n Without surcease -\\n\\n But exiles dwell in stranger-lands!\\n\\n You say \u0027twere bitter, men so rude,\\n\\n To sell your dreams of Shai-Hulud,\\n\\n For tasteless food -\\n\\n And exiles, dwell in stranger-lands.\\n\\n You make Arrakis grow infirm,\\n\\n Silence the passage of the worm\\n\\n And end your term -\\n\\n As exiles, dwell in stranger-lands.\\n\\n Alia! They name you Coan-Teen,\\n\\n That spirit who is never seen\\n\\n Until -\"\\n\\n \"Enough!\" Alia screamed. She pushed herself half out of her throne. \"I\u0027ll have you -\"\\n\\n \"Alia!\" Jessica spoke just loud enough, voice pitched just right to avoid confrontation while gaining full attention. It was a masterful use of Voice and all who heard it recognized the trained powers in this demonstration. Alia sank back into her seat and Jessica noted that she showed not the slightest discomfiture.\\n\\n This, too, was anticipated, Jessica thought. How very interesting.\\n\\n \"The judgment on this first one is mine,\" Jessica reminded her.\\n\\n \"Very well.\" Alia\u0027s words were barely audible.\\n\\n \"I find this one a fitting gift for Farad\u0027n,\" Jessica said. \"He has a tongue which cuts like a crysknife. Such bloodletting as that tongue can administer would be healthy for our own court, but I\u0027d rather he ministered to House Corrino.\"\\n\\n A light rippling of laughter spread through the hall.\\n\\n Alia permitted herself a snorting exhalation. \"Do you know what he called me?\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t call you anything, daughter. He but reported that which he or anyone else could hear in the streets. There they call you Coan-Teen...\"\\n\\n \"The female death-spirit who walks without feet,\" Alia snarled.\\n\\n \"If you put away those who report accurately, you\u0027ll keep only those who know what you want to hear,\" Jessica said, her voice sweet. \"I can think of nothing more poisonous than to rot in the stink of your own reflections.\"\\n\\n Audible gasps came from those immediately below the thrones.\\n\\n Jessica focused on Mohandis, who remained silent, standing completely uncowed. He awaited whatever judgment was passed upon him as though it did not matter. Mohandis was exactly the kind of man her Duke would have chosen to have by his side in troubled times: one who acted with confidence of his own judgment, but accepted whatever befell, even death, without berating his fate. Then why had he chosen this course?\\n\\n \"Why did you sing those particular words?\" Jessica asked him.\\n\\n He lifted his head to speak clearly: \"I\u0027d heard that the Atreides were honorable and open-minded. I\u0027d a thought to test it and perhaps to stay here in your service, thereby having the time to seek out those who robbed me and deal with them in my own fashion.\"\\n\\n \"He dares test us!\" Alia muttered.\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Jessica asked.\\n\\n She smiled down at the troubadour to signal goodwill. He had come into this hall only because it offered him opportunity for another adventure, another passage through his universe. Jessica found herself tempted to bind him to her own entourage, but Alia\u0027s reaction boded evil for brave Mohandis. There were also those signs which said this was the course expected of the Lady Jessica - take a brave and handsome troubadour into her service as she\u0027d taken brave Gurney Halleck. Best Mohandis were sent on his way, though it rankled to lose such a fine specimen to Farad\u0027n.\\n\\n \"He shall go to Farad\u0027n,\" Jessica said. \"See that he gets his passage money. Let his tongue draw the blood of House Corrino and see how he survives it.\"\\n\\n Alia glowered at the floor, then produced a belated smile. \"The wisdom of the Lady Jessica prevails,\" she said, waving Mohandis away.\\n\\n That did not go the way she wanted, Jessica thought, but there were indicators in Alia\u0027s manner that a more potent test remained.\\n\\n Another supplicant was being brought forward.\\n\\n Jessica, noting her daughter\u0027s reaction, felt the gnawing of doubts. The lesson learned from the twins was needed here. Let Alia be Abomination, still she was one of the preborn. She could know her mother as she knew herself. It did not compute that Alia would misjudge her mother\u0027s reactions in the matter of the troubadour. Why did Alia stage that confrontation? To distract me?\\n\\n There was no more time to reflect. The second supplicant had taken his place below the twin thrones, his Advocate at his side.\\n\\n The supplicant was a Fremen this time, an old man with the sand marks of the desert-born on his face. He was not tall, but had a wiry body and the long dishdasha usually worn over a stillsuit gave him a stately appearance. The robe was in keeping with his narrow face and beaked nose, the glaring eyes of blue-on-blue. He wore no stillsuit and seemed uncomfortable without it. The gigantic space of the Audience Hall must seem to him like the dangerous open air which robbed his flesh of its priceless moisture. Under the hood, which had been thrown partly back, he wore the knotted keffiya headdress of a Naib.\\n\\n \"I am Ghadhean al-Fali,\" he said, placing one foot on the steps to the thrones to signify his status above that of the mob. \"I was one of Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s death commandos and I am here concerning a matter of the desert.\"\\n\\n Alia stiffened only slightly, a small betrayal. Al-Fali\u0027s name had been on that demand to place Jessica on the Council.\\n\\n A matter of the desert! Jessica thought.\\n\\n Ghadhean al-Fali had spoken before his Advocate could open the pleading. With that formal Fremen phrase he had placed them on notice that he brought them something of concern to all of Dune - and that he spoke with the authority of a Fedaykin who had offered his life beside that of Paul Muad\u0027Dib. Jessica doubted that this was what Ghadhean al-Fali had told Javid or the Advocate General in seeking audience here. Her guess was confirmed as an official of the Priesthood rushed forward from the rear of the chamber waving the black cloth of intercession.\\n\\n \"My Ladies!\" the official called out. \"Do not listen to this man! He comes under false -\"\\n\\n Jessica, watching the Priest run toward them, caught a movement out of the corners of her eyes, saw Alia\u0027s hand signaling in the old Atreides battle language: \"Now!\" Jessica could not determine where the signal was directed, but acted instinctively with a lurch to the left, taking throne and all. She rolled away from the crashing throne as she fell, came to her feet as she heard the sharp spat of a maula pistol... and again. But she was moving with the first sound, felt something tug at her right sleeve. She dove into the throng of supplicants and courtiers gathered below the dais. Alia, she noted, had not moved.\\n\\n Surrounded by people, Jessica stopped.\\n\\n Ghadhean al-Fali, she saw, had dodged to the other side of the dais, but the Advocate remained in his original position.\\n\\n It had all happened with the rapidity of an ambush, but everyone in the Hall knew where trained reflexes should have taken anyone caught by surprise. Alia and the Advocate stood frozen in their exposure.\\n\\n A disturbance toward the middle of the room caught Jessica\u0027s attention and she forced a way through the throng, saw four supplicants holding the Priest official. His black cloth of intercession lay near his feet, a maula pistol exposed in its folds. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-13.html","bookId":2155,"book":{"id":2155,"title":"Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles #3) \\n The desert planet of Arrakis has begun to grow green and lush.
