Here the Catholic confederates fight to retake Protestant lands. Confederates who have a long-standing hatred for England and her king. Do you see? The Confederates are not naturally Royalist, aye?” He watched her face, waiting for her to nod her understanding before he continued. “But the king, he fancies his Catholic wife and is inclined to let we savages be.” He gave a quick laugh. “While Parliament would oust both Catholics and king. And so two enemies have found they have much in common. Irish Catholics supporting an English monarch. My father never thought he\u0027d see the day,” he added with a chuckle. “Will you fight?” she asked abruptly. “If I must.” She turned her face away sharply, unable to look at him. “Leannan, I\u0027ve simply come for more men. I rally troops to return with me to help hold the MacDonald castle at Dunyveg. But… ” He was quiet for a moment. “Leannan, look at me. Please.” “Don\u0027t,” she rasped. She turned her face back to him and didn\u0027t bother to hide the angry tears that shimmered there . “You need to go back to Scotland now. Fight there. Not here.” “Och, Haley lass. I fight where I must. I gather men, but even now the Parliamentary army marches south. I\u0027ll not turn back to Scotland, leaving my allies to face their enemy alone. If the Munster army needs me on Irish soil, then that is where I\u0027ll stand.” They arrived two days later, and Haley\u0027s greatest fear was realized. It was as she suspected. The Munster army did indeed lay claim to MacColla. They were welcomed at Assolas House, a lovely, two-story mansion, complete with a carpet of ivy covering the gray stones of its facade and a river babbling gently beyond. The grounds were lush, featuring flowers, fruits, and a serene sweep of green lawn. And Haley thought it hell. She knew she needed to take control of the situation. Needed to figure out how exactly to save MacColla from himself. But reasonable solutions eluded her. The only strategy she came up with would be to knock him on the head and whisk him as far as she could from Ireland . But she knew, he\u0027d only come to, and come back. They sat at dinner with the Lord Taaffe and though she told herself she should\u0027ve been grateful for a meal consisting of more than just oats and hare on a spit, she couldn\u0027t muster enough of an appetite to eat. Rollo and the others had dined earlier, leaving just the three of them to, as Taaffe had put it, “more thoroughly acquaint themselves.” She wished she\u0027d been able to dine with the soldiers, not being much in the acquainting mood. Once inhabited by Catholic monks, the Assolas dining room featured a long, well-used table with benches on either side. Taaffe and MacColla sat directly across from each other. And Haley saw immediately what a mess that was going to be. Lord Theobald Taaffe was an antique. With his curled hair and fine waistcoat, he\u0027d clearly gone straight from wealth and careful tutelage to a grand military posting. He was broad chivalry, not blood and iron rations. The sort of man who\u0027d ride into battle well -groomed and flanked by an attendant to carry his provisions. Not MacColla\u0027s sort at all. Haley watched her love\u0027s face darken through the meal, forced as he was to sit captive to Taaffe\u0027s uninformed opining. When the man announced that he\u0027d sent a letter to the enemy, proposing they dispatch a like number of men to fight for the purpose of recreation, MacColla\u0027s face turned purple. “A generous gamester am I” Taaffe elaborated, “but alas, the Parliamentarians did not rise to my challenge.” “You did what?” MacColla snarled. “Is it you think you can resolve this war as though a game of dice?” “The men have seemed dispirited of late. I\u0027d thought a good and chivalrous challenge would rouse the blood.” “Gee,” Haley muttered, astounded by the absurdity, “that\u0027s very… King Arthur of you.” “This is no sport we play at,” MacColla said with steel in his voice. “No joust, no tilts. You\u0027ll get your fill of blood once the fighting begins. Roused indeed. Blood enough will spill - the sod will weep with it.” MacColla\u0027s near-growl brought her eyes to him. She saw him, truly saw him, for what he was. A blooded Highlander, eager for battle. The flicker of humor she\u0027d felt a moment before took a dark turn. It was this buffoon seated across from them who\u0027d be by MacColla\u0027s side in battle. “Ah, yes,” Taaffe agreed gravely. “Bloody days are upon us. Even now we have an army of twelve hundred horse and seven thousand foot rallied. Most are encamped at Kanturk less than a league hence. The rest wait on Knocknanuss Hill. The best strategic position in Cork, I dare say.” Knocknanuss. Haley sat upright on the hard bench, her heart thumping to life. “Though our foe marches toward us, we still strongly outnumber… But, dear girl” - Taaffe turned his attention to Haley - “are you ill?” He turned to MacColla. “I beg your forgiveness, sir. How dare I speak of such dark matters before one of the fairer ”- “What did you say?” Haley interrupted. “I fear you swoon ”- “No,” she snapped. “ Where? Where did you just say the soldiers were?” “Why, Knocknanuss Hill, to be sure. Venture to the top, and you shall be rewarded by the finest of landscapes stretching before you.” But his words were just a drone in her ears. Knocknanuss. Her body buzzed with adrenalin. Why did that name strike a chord? She\u0027d once learned something critical, but what had it been? Knocknanuss. There was something that had happened in Knocknanuss. Chapter Twenty-Seven “Come on, you can tell me,” Haley said, enjoying the look of discomfort on Rollo\u0027s face. Since hearing the name Knocknanuss, she\u0027d been upset. She finally remembered it as the site of a famous battle, but who won, and how, still eluded her. There were just too many battles from that time period; she couldn\u0027t recall them all. But she was finding sitting and talking with Will Rollo to be a welcome diversion. She asked him again, “James Graham is alive, isn\u0027t he?” “A crowd of hundreds would claim otherwise,” Rollo replied flatly. “Graham was seen hanged, after all.” Rollo stared straight ahead, and Haley used the opportunity to study his profile. He was a large man. Not like MacColla with his massive height and brawn, but more movie-star tall, with fine, chiseled features. She eyed his sharp jaw and cheekbones, and the thick waves of chestnut brown hair skimming the nape of his neck. Though he wasn\u0027t all ferocious Highlander, Rollo didn\u0027t strike her as a courtly Lowland type either. He fell somewhere in the middle. Sort of how she imagined James Graham. “But MacColla all but said Graham is alive. He said you were friends. Implied that you are friends.” “I didn\u0027t hear MacColla say such a thing.” She would\u0027ve sworn she saw a smile glimmer for a moment in his eyes. She looked back to the dance floor, considering the question of James Graham. She realized all of her theories and speculation just didn\u0027t matter anymore. MacColla was all that mattered now. She scanned the room, seeking him out. He stood on the edge of the dance floor, watching dancers reel to the skirling of the pipes. They might be far from Scottish shores, she thought with a grim smile, but leave it to the MacDonalds to bring their piper wherever they went. The set ended, and she heard someone call MacColla\u0027s name. She watched as he downed his ale in one long swallow. A man tossed him a broadsword. He grinned , catching it easily. The pipes shrilled to life once more, and MacColla joined two men on the dance floor. A sword dance. Her heart thrilled at the sight of these big, glowering men, laying their swords crossed on the ground to begin one of the most ancient of rituals. She felt so filled up at the sight of him. Glorious and exuberant, with a broad smile, already prancing to the music. Someone began to slam his tankard on a table, keeping time to the music. He was joined by another, then by fists on tables and clapping hands, until a drumbeat sounded through the room. Haley had considered MacColla to be the most magnificent of men. But seeing him dance she realized why songs had been written about him. Why history remembered him as more than an ordinary man. His charisma, his passion and delight, ignited the room. He was more than a man, he truly was an epic hero. The men hopped and skipped about the blades, their arms raised high, plaids dancing with their movements. She beamed. Such a simple and pure pleasure it was to watch him move. It thrilled through her, cutting the despair, and she knew then why the Scots turned to pipes and dance and ale, as she discovered some hidden glimmer of joy buried deep in her soul. Her eyes cut briefly to Rollo, and she wondered what he thought of all this. His face was calm, his usual dourness replaced by some other, softer emotion. But she knew he would never be able to do such a thing as sword dancing. The beat grew faster, and Haley clapped in time, her eyes drawn back to the men. One of them tossed off his bonnet and the crowd cheered. MacColla loudest of all. He laughed heartily, his feet moving rapidly in time, kicking and hopping over steel. His eyes searched the crowd. He found her and grinned. Pain sideswiped her, stabbing her in the chest, and Haley clutched her hands in her skirts. Watching him, seeing such happiness, such life, seared her, pulling her lungs tight, dimming her vision. We have to get out of here. Leave Ireland. “Don\u0027t these people realize they\u0027re at war?” Haley didn\u0027t realize she\u0027d spoken until she heard Rollo\u0027s reply. “A bit of revelry is good for a soldier. Many of these men will return from battle a lifeless body on a bier.” He studied the crowd, standing and cheering, clapping in time to the music. “Such diversions aren\u0027t uncommon before battle.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-37.html","bookId":1617,"book":{"id":1617,"title":"Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3)","description":"Storyline: Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3) While doing research for her dissertation, graduate student Haley Fitzpatrick stumbles upon a strange artifact—which sends her back in time to old Scotland, directly into the path of the notorious Alasdair MacColla, a warrior known for his enormous physical presence and bloodthirsty reputation.
