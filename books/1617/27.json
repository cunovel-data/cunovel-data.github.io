Haley hadn\u0027t slept the night before, hadn\u0027t had any real food in some time, and it was finally all catching up with her. “Can we sit down? I need to take a break.” MacColla shook his head, disappointed in himself. “Och, of course.” He took her arm, helping her to the ground. “Of course you can rest.” Her skin was clammy in his hands, cool and damp. Campbell had been the only thing on his mind, and he\u0027d ended up pressing her too hard. The lass had be en gone for some time and likely hadn\u0027t eaten or slept - of course she needed rest. He wasn\u0027t used to dealing with women and cursed his clumsiness. “Have you a chill?” He stood to unwind his plaid for her, but she stopped him. “No,” she tried a small lau gh but it came out as a breathy exhale. “Please, there\u0027s no need to strip.” “Shall I find us some food? You need to feed yourself.” “Really, MacColla. I\u0027m not going to expire.” She gestured to the ground at her side. “I just need… a moment.” “It\u0027s Alasdair, lass. My Christian name.” He sat next to her. “You may call me Alasdair.” “You\u0027re MacColla in my mind.” She looked at him, a sidelong glance that suggested much yet said nothing. “I don\u0027t know that I could call you anything else.” His mind raced. “And how do you know of me?” She clearly wasn\u0027t a spy for Campbell. And though he was known for his victories with Graham, he\u0027d thought women didn\u0027t generally concern themselves with the finer points of battle. “Tell me who you are, leannan. A Fitzpatrick, you say. Tell me of your family.” He tentatively reached to her, paused, then put his hand lightly at the small of her back. “I\u0027m about to bring you to the very heart of mine. I must know.” Instead of answering, she rested her chin in her hands. Looking into the distance, she asked matter-of-factly. “What year is it?” “Ciod an rud?” Her peculiar question caught him off guard. “What did you say?” “I just wondered… ” She turned to face him, the mystery in those gray eyes honed to a razor-sharp point. “Really, MacColla, what year is it?” “Sixteen forty-six, though surely you ”- “Is James Graham alive?” She waved her hand. “Never mind. Don\u0027t answer that.” “Who are you to have such concerns?” “I\u0027m not from here.” “Aye” - he gave a small laugh - “I\u0027d reasoned that for myself.” “No.” She looked away from him again. “I mean, I\u0027m really not from here.” Haley seemed so small then, so alone. He leaned closer to her, wrapped his arm tight around her shoulder. MacColla thought it best to simply wait in patient silence for whatever tale she had for the telling. She inhaled deeply. “Well. Here goes. I\u0027m from the future, MacColla.” Haley looked at him, waiting for a response. He just stared blankly, unsure what she was getting at. She shut her eyes, as if bracing for something painful, then rattled quickly, “My name is Haley Anne Fitzpatrick, I\u0027m from Boston. Massachusetts. I have… ” She scrubbed her face, swallowed, and tried again, her voice thickened by tears. “I\u0027ve got five brothers. Danny, Colin, Conor, Gerry, and Jimmy. My dad… ” She made a tiny pained squeak, tightly controlled anguish keening fromthe cracks. “My dad\u0027s from Donegal. But he went to America the moment he finished school. He\u0027s a cop. Was. Was a cop.” She stopped for a moment, breathing hard, as if she\u0027d just sprinted a mile. Finally Haley continued, this time sounding numb, wooden, “My mom\u0027s Irish too, but not fresh off the boat. Her folks were from Cork. I\u0027m a PhD student at Harvard.” Her tone swelled again, abruptly overwrought. “Get that. Harvard. That\u0027s a big deal where I\u0027m from. Celtic scholar. My focus is seventeenth-century weaponry. Isn\u0027t that a hoot?” She babbled feverishly now, unhinged. “I was born in the 1970s. How wacked is that? Platform shoes and disco dancing. But I was too young for all that. For me it was Kool-Aid. Star Wars. Madonna.” She grabbed his arm, gave it a shake. “It\u0027s the twenty-first century where I\u0027m from. Planes in the sky. Telephones. Video games. Not to mention hot showers.” She paused, then mused wistfully, “God, hot showers seem like rocket science right about now.” She looked unseeing into the distance. MacColla finally asked, “What is it you\u0027re saying?” His voice was dangerously quiet. “I don\u0027t ken your words, leannan.” Leannan, she thought. He\u0027d been calling her leannan. Darling. Sweetheart. Lover. Of Alasdair MacColla. So preposterous. And yet it gave her strength to see it through. “What am I saying?” She pinned him with her gaze once more. “I\u0027m saying this is the past. To me, you\u0027re from the past. You died. Years ago. Hundreds of years ago. I know about you because you\u0027re famous. Congratulations,” she tossed off. “You die in Ireland. I don\u0027t remember when exactly, or how. You\u0027re betrayed, that\u0027s all I can remember.” Haley raked her hands through her hair, resting her head in her hands, deflated. “You get killed,” she said softly. She looked at him, chin resting on her arm, no longer bothering to wipe the tears from her cheeks. “It all goes to shit. God, there\u0027s Culloden. The Highland Clearances. Tartans are outlawed. Swords too.” She muttered, “All to shit.” He didn\u0027t understand half of what she\u0027d said. Less than that even. But the future? Uncertain of what to say, he tried to make a joke of it. “Are you certain you didn\u0027t clout your own head with that wee busk of yours?” She shot him such a look of raw pain, he felt it through his body, as gutting as any physical wound. “Why do you keep asking of James?” His tone was gentle, and the flicker of relief he read on her face made his chest swell. Had she feared him? Feared his response? “Graham of Montrose,” he added softly. “Oh. I know who you mean all right. I found a weapon. “I think it was his weapon. \u0027For JG, with love from Magda.\u0027 the inscription said. I mean, who else would it belong to?” “But how does that prove ”- “I can\u0027t explain it. I just got a gut feeling about the gun, that it couldn\u0027t have been made - wouldn\u0027t have been made - before 1650. Here,” she gestured to the gun she\u0027d fired earlier, its long, thin barrel tucked now at his belt. “Hand me that.” She took it from his hands, plowing forward despite the bewilderment on his face. “What kind is it?” “A pistol, lass.” She shot him an exasperated look. “Yeah, but what kind? What kind of mechanism does it have?” He took it back from her, studied the curved wooden handle in his hands. The frizzen and flash pan, its cock and the dog catch that locked it. “It\u0027s one of the new flintlocks with the wee lock just here.” he said, pointing to what was an early version of a gun safety. “\u0027Tis an English weapon.” “How many flintlocks have you seen before this?” “Not many. As I ken it, they\u0027re favored on the Continent. But in the Highlands?” He shrugged. “Nay, there\u0027s none such as this here, generally speaking. You speak of guns, but my men are lucky if they find a blade in their hands.” “So what do the Highlanders shoot? When they do have a gun, I mean. What type of gun do you have?” “You\u0027re a peculiar one, leannan.” Her intense focus urged him on. “Wheel lock,” MacColla replied with a sigh. “That\u0027s it?” “Good Christ, I thought you lassies just had a mind for frocks and hairstyles.” He chucked her chin. “I\u0027d no idea what I\u0027ve been missing these years, away at war. I could\u0027ve been in parlors discussing muskets and armor with the beautiful ladies.” Seeing her grave face, he just leaned back on his elbows, kicking his feet in front of him, to give it some thought. His arm remained wrapped around her, hand tucked casually at her hip. “I once had a matchlock. But in a good Highland mist?” He shook his head. “With that wee wick on the end, och. Damp makes the gun unusable, aye? Too bloody hard to keep lit.” “Yes,” she said firmly. “That was true.” “Oh,” he gave a surprised chuckle. “I thank you.” Ignoring his sarcasm, she continued, “Well this gun that I saw, Graham\u0027s gun, it was actually a combination weapon” - she waved her hand - “but that\u0027s beside the point. This pistol had a perfect little flintlock. The striking surface, the flash pan, all one tiny, perfect self-contained bit. You tell me how many of those you\u0027ve seen lately.” “So what are you saying?” “I\u0027m saying we dated the piece to 1675 which is… ” “Which is after James was said to have died.” Sitting up, he withdrew from her, his face solemn. “But why should I believe you?” He kept his tone matter-offact. Though he didn\u0027t accept her story, neither did he discount her. Her fighting skills had already shocked him enough for one lifetime. MacColla couldn\u0027t imagine why he should be surprised she\u0027d come at him with something even more outrageous. “What you say about this gun proves nothing.” He saw her mind working, those gray eyes staring at the pistol she held in her hands. The pistol she\u0027d fired as if she\u0027d been doing it all her life. Could it be true? She shot and fought and spoke like no other woman he\u0027d met. Like none he\u0027d ever heard of. She was willful and strong. And so healthy too, that was clear. Her limbs, long and straight. Even those radiant cheeks and her bright, even smile. They spoke to a life of luxury. Of privilege.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-27.html","bookId":1617,"book":{"id":1617,"title":"Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3)","description":"Storyline: Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3) While doing research for her dissertation, graduate student Haley Fitzpatrick stumbles upon a strange artifact—which sends her back in time to old Scotland, directly into the path of the notorious Alasdair MacColla, a warrior known for his enormous physical presence and bloodthirsty reputation.
