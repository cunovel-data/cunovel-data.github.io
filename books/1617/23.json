MacColla would be damned if he\u0027d see another of his people taken by Campbell.\\n\\n Especially this woman. This woman who had been badly injured before. He\u0027d not see Haley injured again.\\n\\n “I must find her,” he growled. “I leave at once. I\u0027ll track them. Find them.”\\n\\n “Aye.” Scrymgeour said gravely. “I\u0027ll keep Jean with me.”\\n\\n Something flashed in MacColla\u0027s eyes as he looked from Scrymgeour to his sister. Some complicated internal calculus, a question asked and answered.\\n\\n “Take her south,” he responded finally. “To safety. My family waits for us in Kintyre. Take her for me, Scrymgeour.”\\n\\n “I will.” Scrymgeour didn\u0027t appear to think then, simply reached his hand to rest protectively at the small of her back. “Leave, now,” he said. “And I\u0027ll keep Jean safe in my care.”\\n\\n Chapter Fifteen\\n\\n “I have to” - Haley lowered her voice into an outraged hiss “I have to, you know, bu thoil learn fual a dhèanamh.” Somehow saying she needed to pee in Gaelic made the task easier.\\n\\n The man only gaped at her. The small fire flickered between them, casting severe shadows on his face, exaggerating his puzzle ment. She sat silently, waiting stubbornly, all the while wondering at what she might have accidentally said.\\n\\n She\u0027d sat through the night, refusing to fall asleep, even though two of her three captors had dozed loudly, their backs to the flames.\\n\\n Of course Campbell hadn\u0027t appeared drowsy at all, and stared at her unabashedly through the night. Haley did her best to stare a challenge right back, thinking all the while that the man likely didn\u0027t let much slip past him.\\n\\n “Tha i ag iarraidh mùin” Campbell growled. He didn\u0027t take his eyes from Haley, which scanned her with something between distaste and desire. Only he could make some crude remark about pissing sound menacing.\\n\\n “Go then.” the man announced. His use of English scorned her attempts at Gaelic. He was much younger than Campbell, in his twenties, she guessed. The dirt brown beard that covered his face like a great soiled and furry mask split into a grin.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t need to fake her urgency. She really did have to go - she thought she\u0027d burst from it - but had waited until the third man had awoken and gone off to do his own business.\\n\\n The more she could better her odds, the greater her chances for escape. From what she gathered, they were riding back to that hideous castle at Inveraray. And she wasn\u0027t about to let herself be the next guest in Campbell\u0027s cellar.\\n\\n Haley thrust out her hands, still bound, and raised her eyebrows. They\u0027d untied her feet, but her hands were still tied tightly in front of her.\\n\\n “No,” the bearded one said flatly, as if to an impudent child.\\n\\n “Come on.” She raised her hands higher. “What am I going to do?” She turned to Campbell and added, “You\u0027re surely not afraid a woman could best you?”\\n\\n Her gamble worked. Campbell didn\u0027t think a woman could best them. He nodded at the bearde d man to cut her bonds, and hope flickered to life in her chest.\\n\\n She creaked to standing, stiff from holding the same cross-legged position for so long on the cold ground.\\n\\n “Go with her,” Campbell spat. She shot what she hoped was an innocent look in his direction, and he added. “Be quick about it, girl. It\u0027s time for us to leave before your husband finds us.”\\n\\n “My husband?” Surely he didn\u0027t think she and MacColl were married?\\n\\n The bearded man snorted a laugh, and a slow smile spread across Campbell\u0027s face. Haley chalked it up to simply his version of a lewd joke.\\n\\n She turned to head deeper into the trees when she heard Campbell say, “Go with her.” The bearded man must\u0027ve made some suggestive gesture because Campbell quickly added, “Do, and I\u0027ll punish you myself.”\\n\\n Haley\u0027s mind raced. She\u0027d hoped they\u0027d let her go alone. That she could get a bit of a head start. Then run like hell and hope for the best. But of course that would\u0027ve been too easy.\\n\\n She heard his shuffling feet following close behind her and mentally sized him up. He was about five -eight, five -nine tops. Not much taller that she was.\\n\\n But he\u0027d be armed. She\u0027d seen the glint of a pistol at his waist. She imagined he probably slept with the thing strapped to him. It would take him some time to lo ad it. Fifteen seconds, maybe.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t wearing a sword. Did he have a knife, though?\\n\\n That was something to consider.\\n\\n She wished she\u0027d tucked her own knife into her dress somehow. The blade wouldn\u0027t do much damage, but it would\u0027ve been better than nothing.\\n\\n She wondered again if he had a dagger. If she didn\u0027t manage to escape this time, perhaps she could somehow steal it. She felt her corset tight at her chest. It was stiff, unbending. She could tuck a blade away in her clothes. Maybe tear a slit along the bottom of her corset and slide it in.\\n\\n The corset. Her heart kicked hard with excitement. Of course - her corset. She already had a weapon.\\n\\n She was wearing it.\\n\\n She\u0027d marveled at the hideous contraption as Jean had laced her up tight. Most old corsets had ivory busks running up the front. A rib roughly two inches thick and fifteen inches long, stiff enough to hold a woman in tight.\\n\\n Not so this one.\\n\\n Hers had a busk all right, but it was made of steel. She\u0027d heard of metal busks but had never seen one, and imagined it would\u0027ve been cheaper than its ivory counterpart.\\n\\n At the time, she had unlaced the top a bit, peeked at the buckskin that encased the steel rib. The leather was mottled dark brown, stained with some other woman\u0027s sweat.\\n\\n “Give me a minute,” she called to the bearded man and thought the crack in her voice was just as well. He\u0027d assume she was nervous for other reasons.\\n\\n She brought her hands to her sternum, and dug between her breasts for the small laces that secured the busk into the front of the corset. Her fingers worked quickly, oosening, fumbling.\\n\\n She glanced over her shoulder and he stood, smiling. Dark brown decay clung like moss in the crooks of his slanted teeth. It gave her focus.\\n\\n Relieving herself was the first order of business. If the creep wanted to watch, let him. Turning her back firmly to him, she squatted, tucking her dress up only as far as absolutely necessary. He\u0027d think he was getting a show, but really all he\u0027d see was the back of her dress.\\n\\n She took a moment to shudder in relief, then groped at the top of her corset with renewed concentration. She worked a finger into the narrow pocket that formed the front panel of the corset. Touched the cool edge of leather that encased her busk.\\n\\n Her weapon.\\n\\n She had to arch her b ack to shimmy it free, and she gasped with the pain the motion shot through her ribs.\\n\\n “Hurry yourself, girl.”\\n\\n She heard him shuffle impatiently at her back.\\n\\n The busk was heavy in her hand. A reassuring heft, like a length of construction rebar. She tucked it close to her chest.\\n\\n Her preference would\u0027ve been to pick at the stitching and pull the steel from its leather enclosure, but she had no time.\\n\\n Just as well, she thought, as a plan came to her. She slid her hands to the base of the busk, as if it were a bat, and savored the weight in her grip.\\n\\n A sturdy little club.\\n\\n Smiling, she stood and walked briskly forward, keeping the clansman at her back.\\n\\n “Ho!” Haley heard the surprise in his voice as he rushed to catch up. “Ho, girl!”\\n\\n She walked faster, then faster still. If he was going to talk to her like a horse, let him try to corral her like one.\\n\\n A clearing lay ahead. The trees thinned, and their leaves glowed light green from the growing sunlight.\\n\\n “Ho!” His voice was angry now.\\n\\n But her smile only grew broader as she broke into a jog. She needed to reach the clearing. The sound of his breath closed in, echoing through the silence of the woods.\\n\\n She burst into a run, stopping just a few feet outside the edge of the grove. Wait.\\n\\n Her father\u0027s voice came to her then, so clear, so eerily vivid as to almost break her concentration. Wait for it.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t until she felt him burst into the clearing that she finally spun to face him. She pivoted hard, the busk in her hands, the full force of her weight behind it. She spun and slammed it into the side of his head with a satisfying crack.\\n\\n “Home run, motherfucker.” Her voice was giddy, a match to the high pitch of adrenalin that trembled through her.\\n\\n She came back to herself at once. She needed to run. Fast.\\n\\n She figured she had five minutes tops before Campbell came to see what was taking them so long.\\n\\n But first… She knelt and grabbed the man\u0027s pistol and tugged the small leather bullet bag from his belt.\\n\\n She needed gunpowder. Where would it be?\\n\\n She patted down the man as quickly as she could, hoping he was truly out cold. Then she felt it. A hard, oval bulb in his breast pocket. Using the very tips of her fingers, she peeled open his soiled and smelly coat. An uneven pocket had been stitched in as an afterthought, and the dull stopper of a brass priming flask poked out from the top.\\n\\n Hurry up. She grabbed it, shoved it and the bullet bag in her corset, then stood and scanned the horizon. Hills and more hills. She\u0027d need to go back up and over the mountain range.\\n\\n Her heart sank. The gravelly hillsides and low-lying tangles of brush wouldn\u0027t provide any cover.\\n\\n She rubbed her thumb distractedly over the pistol\u0027s wooden grip.\\n\\n Campbell had ponies. And though they were rugged animals, there would be no way they could make it easily over the steepest peaks. She didn\u0027t know about his other clansman, but she knew she could beat Campbell in a footrace.\\n\\n Fat sod. Haley broke into a run.\\n\\n As she pumped her arms in the hard slog up the first slope, she came up with as many British slang terms as she could for Campbell.\\n\\n Bloody porker.\\n\\n Bollocks. Wanker. Ugly shite.\\n\\n Her own version of a mantra.\\n\\n She switched the gun to her other hand, clutching the thick handle tight.\\n\\n Catch me if you can.\\n\\n MacColla squatted, scanning his eyes along the terrain. Two sets of footprints had left the castle, marked clear in the dirt just outside the entrance. Men\u0027s boots, not walking in a straight line. They would\u0027ve carried her then. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-23.html","bookId":1617,"book":{"id":1617,"title":"Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3)","description":"Storyline: Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3) \\n While doing research for her dissertation, graduate student Haley Fitzpatrick stumbles upon a strange artifact—which sends her back in time to old Scotland, directly into the path of the notorious Alasdair MacColla, a warrior known for his enormous physical presence and bloodthirsty reputation. \\n Assuming that this woman with the mysterious accent is an enemy spy, MacColla promptly kidnaps her.
