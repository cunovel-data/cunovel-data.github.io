Niece, then.”\n “A bheil Gaidhlig agad?” she asked haltingly. Her grammar was stilted, overly familiar.\n “Aye, I speak Gaelic,” he replied in English. “And what else?” He pushed her chin roughly from his hand. “But apparently you\u0027ve strange notions of the Gaedhealg tongue.”\n He spared a glance to the men passed out by the fire, then MacColla squinted, studying her. “Where is it you\u0027re from?”\n She leaned toward him, peering through the shadows. “You!” Terror lit her features like a torch. “You were in that… that painting. Who the hell are you?” She looked around frantically. “Where the hell\u0027d you take me?”\n Was she cursing him to the devil? Did this wee Campbell lass dare damn him? MacColla glared at her, trying to make sense of her strange accent. She seemed to be speaking English, but none like he\u0027d ever heard. Her words were like the sharp claps of a barking dog. “Speak slow when you curse me.”\n He approached her. He saw spirit in those wide gray eyes, and he was compelled to look closer.\n She shuffled back, arms askew as if to brace herself on thin air. The lass was shouting at him now, unintelligible words.\n MacColla took her in once again, from head to foot. She was a well -proportioned one, of modest height and with just enough meat on her bones. If Campbell had a mind for kidnap, two could play at his game. If only he could understand her clamoring.\n “Air do shocairl” he commanded, speaking over her. “Och… slowly now. I\u0027d hear your curses… ” He studied the movement of her mouth, trying to understand her words. Her lips were full and dark against the pale glow of her cheeks in the moonlight. He\u0027d taste this Campbell woman, he decided suddenly. “Before I wipe them from your mouth.”\n He grabbed her, wrapping his hand easily around her upper arm. Though he\u0027d pillaged in his day, MacColla was never one for rape. But a kiss? One kiss would be no crime.\n The woman once again flexed her arm in his grip and he smiled outright. The feel of her solid flesh in his hand madehis heart kick. Many a lass had offered themselves for a kiss by the great hero MacColla. But none such as this. This one had muscle to spare. Interesting.\n Curse it, but he wanted a bloody Campbell.\n He leaned down, closing the distance between them. The woman froze, like a hare paralyzed by the sight of the hunter\u0027s bow. A low laugh rumbled in his throat, so eager was he to taste her. His free hand clutched the soft flesh of her rump, pulling her toward him.\n MacColla kissed her. He\u0027d wanted at first to be rough, but she was soft. So soft and sweet, his mouth gentled in the tasting of her. And, for a single moment, he imagined the lass kissed him back, her breath sighing into him, her mouth opening just enough for him to taste her, fresh and warm on his tongue. And then, with a tiny growl, she caught his lower lip hard between her teeth and bit.\n MacColla pulled away. She glared at him, bored her teeth, and exhaled with the measured breath of a prowling wolf.\n He studied the wee Campbell hellcat before him, and then strangely, inexplicably, he found himself laughing. These long years of exile, his father\u0027s imprisonment, his sister\u0027s capture - all a pall of waiting and dread that had clouded his vision for so long now. It was as if the veil had suddenly burnt to ash kindling MacColla to life. A deep, freeing laughexploded from low in his belly.\n One of the men by the fire stirred.\n He looked to his sister and the terror and confusion in her eyes made him remember himself. Clearing his throat, he nodded to Jean as if she\u0027d communicated more than simply her silent, charged glare. “Aye,” he whispered. “We must go from here.”\n He looked back down at the woman. “A bonny Campbell for my spoils,” he said, licking the blood from his lower lip. It left a taste like rust on his tongue. He smiled wide at the lass then, knowing full well that the blood reddened his teeth.\n He didn\u0027t need a man to help him lower the castle stairs after all, MacColla thought as he guided her to the entryway. He was of a mind to make the wee Campbell assist instead.\n Snagging his hand in her hair, he cupped her head and guided her toward Jean. Despite the violence of the gesture, he tried not to hurt her - the ravaging of women was an ignoble sport. Though he\u0027d half a mind to scare her into docility. He imagined he might need such tactics if he were to manage such a fiery soul as this one.\n His aim was to use her for barter. The next time one of\n MacColla\u0027s Royalists found himself in a Campbell cell, this lass would be good to have at hand. Family members were the most effective bargaining chips.\n He scowled. It was a lesson Campbell himself had taught, with MacColla\u0027s own father and brother as the example. He had handed over any number of his enemy Covenanters, all in hopes of trading for their lives. And if he\u0027d had someone closer to Campbell\u0027s heart with which to barter? Perhaps he could\u0027ve spared his father and brother so many long years imprisoned.\n What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck… The thought pinged through her mind like a loosed pinball.\n Big man, black hair, those brows. And what the fuck was with her reaction to him? The first sight of him had sent an involuntary shiver through her. He\u0027d kissed her, and her body had sent up a quick flare, pure animal reaction to the sheer size of him.\n Haley shook her head to get rid of the memory. She\u0027d get ahold of herself.\n He was clearly the man from that hideous thing she\u0027d found in the storeroom. Blood pounded in her fingertips, throbbing with the memory of that wooden panel, now gone from her hands.\n Stark terror stole the breath from her lungs and the gush of adrenalin through her system dizzied her. Haley forced air into her paralyzed body. Not a victim again. Not this time.\n She summoned her brothers\u0027 voices in her head. Their goading and their challenging. She heard them speak to her, girding her. Man up, Hale.\n “Get the fuck off me.” She tried to flinch her head from his grasp. His hand was mercifully gentle at the nape of her neck, though no less firm. The bastard just chuckled.\n Who the hell was he? And what was with the Gaelic? Was he in her department at school? He\u0027d surely been stalking her, but she\u0027d never seen him before. How had he gotten into the museum?\n Oh God. Sarah. Her panic turned to dread, a cold wash sweeping up from her belly. Was Sarah okay? If anything had happened to her, it was all Haley\u0027s fault.\n “Where\u0027s Sarah? What did you do with Sarah?” She planted her feet hard, making him stumble slightly. He stared at her a moment and hatred surged through her. “Don\u0027t you speak English?”\n “Aye, I\u0027ve the English.” He grasped her chin, pulling her face toward his. “Who\u0027s Sarah? Is it you\u0027ve a sister hiding about as well?” The man looked around, glanced at his companion, and Haley registered the other woman for the first time.\n Haley couldn\u0027t move her head much in his grip, but rolled her eyes as far as she could to study the woman. She seemed to be in league with the man. What kind of scene is this? She was slender and pretty, but Haley was gratified to see the girl also appeared to be a total wreck, her breath hiccupping, tears streaming down her cheeks.\n “Who are you people?” she snarled, struggling in vain.\n He ignored her. focusing only on his companion. “Easy, Jean,” he told the woman in Gaelic. Then Haley thought he said. “We\u0027ll put down the stairs and be gone from here.”\n Stairs? Haley glared at them, trying to make sense of it.\n “Where are you taking me?”\n “Alasdair.” the other woman finally spoke, her voice a tremulous whisper. “The lass isn\u0027t right. She gives me the evil eye, even now.”\n The girl had meant not right in the head. Haley squinted hard at her. If there was any such thing as an evil eye, she\u0027d summon it now for this simpering thing.\n The man barked out a laugh, which seemed to distress his companion all the more. The girl seemed to yield before him, ceding all control. It annoyed Haley, made her want to stand up to him.\n “Please.” The girl spoke again, addressing only Alasdair.\n “Please just take me from this place.”\n His eyes softened when he looked at his companion, his fearsome mask melting into something kinder. A single-minded concern warmed his features, eased his full mouth.\n Haley realized, startled, that he was… handsome.\n And so completely focused on the girl\u0027s well-being. She felt a rush of inexplicable jealousy and glowered at her with renewed zeal, even as she thought how silly her impulse was.\n She didn\u0027t need a man to look out for her. Haley was perfectly capable of looking out for her own damn self.\n The girl\u0027s eyes widened. “Leave the lass be,” she whispered. “She… She\u0027s…” Apprehension and sympathy both animated her features. “She\u0027s not right, Alasdair.”\n Haley could deal with apprehension. It was the girl\u0027s sympathy that pushed her over the edge. She tried to wriggle free from the man\u0027s grasp, hissing at his companion as she did so.\n “Och, enough.” He pushed Haley forward once more, toward what looked like a hole in the wall leading straight into blackness. “We must go, and now.”\n She wracked her brain to make sense of it. He must\u0027ve knocked her out, but where had he taken her? It was like a castle. Had the freak taken her to some crazy McMansion outside Boston?\n She looked around as much as her immobilized head would allow, expecting to see mounted animal heads and gaudy wrought iron fixtures. But the large room was mostly barren. There was just a crude dining table and a few men passed out by the fireplace.\n She considered calling to them for help, but her eyes adjusted and she thought better of it. The dying fire highlighted the ragged halos of their matted hair, sticking out from soiled plaid blankets.\n How had he gotten her there? She did a quick internal check. Nothing was sore, so he couldn\u0027t have knocked her out. He must\u0027ve used chloroform or something. He\u0027d surely had to drive far out of the city to have found this place. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-7.html","bookId":1617,"book":{"id":1617,"title":"Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3) \n While doing research for her dissertation, graduate student Haley Fitzpatrick stumbles upon a strange artifact—which sends her back in time to old Scotland, directly into the path of the notorious Alasdair MacColla, a warrior known for his enormous physical presence and bloodthirsty reputation. \n Assuming that this woman with the mysterious accent is an enemy spy, MacColla promptly kidnaps her.
