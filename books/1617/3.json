His free hand fumbled with the crumpled pack of cigarettes he wasn\u0027t allowed to smoke inside.\n “Yeah. Doc!” Jimmy shouted. He beamed at her from his seat, his arm wrapped tight around his girlfriend Maggie. Haley had to laugh at the sight of him - the tips of his ears already red with drink. They protruded almost comically from his head, accentuated by his buzz-cut hair, regulation cop just like Dad\u0027s. “Get in out of the cold.”\n “Yeah, it\u0027s colder than a nun\u0027s t ”\n “Gerald Patrick!” Her father\u0027s voice boomed from the other end of the bar. “Jesus. Mary, and Joseph, boy. You kiss your mother with that mouth?” He approached Haley, a pint in one hand, a basket of curly fries in the other, and leaned down and bussed her on the cheek. “My day has greatly improved with the vision of you. darlin\u0027 girl. I\u0027m glad to see your work could spare you of an evening.”\n More than forty years had passed since her dad had stepped off the boat from his native Donegal, but he\u0027d never lost the warm Irish burr in his voice.\n “And I take it Mom\u0027s at bridge night?” Even though they\u0027d all stayed local, Haley\u0027s mother had been unhappy to see the last of her kids leave the nest and had taken up all manner of hobbies since. And their mother had been the only one surprised by how much fun she was having now.\n “And where else?” Danny ushered Haley to a seat.\n “Time to focus, people.” Gerry poured himself another.\n “Gerry has twenty bucks on the over,” Danny said, glancing at the television.\n “He\u0027s crazy.” Conor looked at his sister intently. “What do you say? You\u0027ve always been good at picking the line. Will the game go over fifty-four points?”\n Haley took a deep pull of her beer while she considered. “Dallas hasn\u0027t gotten their running game going yet.” she said with the same gravity with which she approached her scholarship. “I think it\u0027s going to be a shoot-out, so yeah, I\u0027d side with Gerry on this one.” She raised her pint to the brother in question.\n “Listen up!” Jimmy reached over the table and stole Gerry\u0027s lighter from his hand. “Hey, attention, people.” He clinked the old metal Zippo on the side of his glass. “I said shut up, you dips.” Jimmy swatted the nearest brother on the head.\n “What the- ” Danny recoiled, and smoothed his hair back down into his ponytail.\n “Apologies, ladies.” Jimmy ignored Danny and nodded at the women. “But we have an announcement. Maggie, love?”\n His girlfriend shyly pulled her hand from beneath the table. Directing her words to Haley, she said, “We were waiting for you to get here. I wanted you to be the first… the first to hear…”\n “You\u0027ll have a new sister!” Jimmy shouted, and was at once drowned out in cheers and a few female shrieks.\n “Really?” Haley leaned into her, genuinely pleased. “I\u0027ve got to see the ring.”\n Colin spoke above the din. “And when are you going to make an honest woman of yourself\u0027, Doc?”\n Haley didn\u0027t deign to give him a look, and merely kicked her brother beneath the table. She held Maggie\u0027s hand, shifting it under the light, setting the small diamond to twinkling. “Oh guys, it\u0027s beautiful.”\n Maggie\u0027s sweet face bloomed into a smile. Between the strawberry blonde curls that framed Maggie\u0027s delicate heart-shaped face and the six-two length of her swarthy brother, Haley couldn\u0027t wait to see what their kids would look like.\n “And look,” she wriggled her ring off and angled it up to the dim bar light. “Jimmy knew my size, and even inscribed it for me.”\n Haley took it from her, focusing on the tiny script. “James loves Maggie.”\n “The lout couldn\u0027t think of anything more creative.” Gerry said.\n “Shut up.” Jimmy threw his brother\u0027s lighter back at him.\n “Her fingers are small.”\n “No.” Haley frowned at them. “It\u0027s simple and perfect. It says it all.” She turned to Jimmy. “It\u0027s lovely. Just perfect.”\n “Blessings kids.” Her father raised his glass in a toast.\n “May the road rise up to meet you… ”\n “Get comfortable.” Gerry leaned low over the table and winked at Haley.\n “May the wind be always at your back.”\n “And here we go,” Danny muttered.\n “May the sun shine warm ”-\n A roar erupted in the bar, and all eyes went to the TV screen. The Patriots had scored a touchdown, and soon everyone\u0027s attention was back on the game.\n James loves Maggie Haley thought, warm inside at the thought of it. Jimmy was a good guy, he deserved every happiness. Her eyes were on the screen, but her mind began to drift.\n Another, much older, inscription popped into her head. Just who would dedicate a dagger to their sweetheart? “For JG, with love from Ma-”\n J. Not a lot of J names in Scotland. Haley wracked her brain. She decided it was safe to assume the recipient had been a man. Maybe John. Though, Scotland in the seventeenth century, the Gaelic version Iain more likely would have been used.\n No, she thought, he was in all likelihood another James, or Jamie.\n But Ma would be harder to pin down. You\u0027d have Mairi, Malveen, Margaret, Marsali…\n “James loves Maggie!”\n “Hey Mag!” she heard Gerry tease. “Give your new brother some sugar.”\n “Mag.”\n “ With love from-”\n “Magda?” Haley exclaimed. The bar had fallen momentarily silent and everyone turned to her, but for Gerry, who was scanning the bar for whomever this new girl might be that his sister was greeting.\n “Sorry. Just thinking.” Haley hid her face in her glass as she took a big sip.\n “You need to focus, ” Colin scolded her.\n “You need to will them to win, Haley.” Conor nodded somberly in agreement.\n JG, she thought. James Graham\u0027s wife was named Magdalen.\n But the dagger was dated 1675. Graham had been hanged at least twenty years before that.\n She shook her head. She was grasping at straws.\n JG could be any one of thousands of men.\n But how many of those would have the resources to buy such an extravagant weapon?\n “Hey Doc.” Gerry snapped his fingers in front of her. “Earth to Haley.”\n “I tell you, she needs to focus.” Colin gravely shook his head.\n “Huh?” Haley looked at them blankly. “Oh, yeah, yeah.” Shifting, she stared blindly at the flat screen hanging in the corner.\n Maybe the piece was misdated.\n But it was a flintlock pistol. Anything prior to 1650 would probably have used a wheel lock mechanism.\n “I have to go.” Haley stood suddenly, screeching her chair along the sticky barroom floor. She was going to drive herself crazy. There was no way on earth that dagger had belonged to the famous war hero, hanged in Edinburgh in the middle of the seventeenth century. She needed to buff the rest of the thing off; she\u0027d see it was Margaret or Marjory or Martha who\u0027d given the strange gift, and then she could stop spinning out. She swore to herself she\u0027d once and for all focus on her dissertation. Just as soon as she figured out this one little mystery.\n Her pronouncement was immediately met with grumbling and dire predictions.\n Danny stared at her in disbelief. “It\u0027s bad mojo to leave before halftime.”\n “You have only yourself to blame if they lose,” Colin said.\n “Aren\u0027t you going to celebrate with us?” Jimmy attempted, in the most masterful tack of all.\n “No, really, guys. I need to chase something down.”\n “We\u0027ll only release you if you\u0027re referring to a male student in that school of yours.” Gerry stretched his leg along the side of the table as if to halt her escape.\n “Stop fooling around,” Conor said, “and sit your butt down. Doc.”\n “Really. Sorry everyone.” Haley reached over to give Maggie a big hug. “Welcome to the family.”\n “She\u0027s really leaving?” Conor asked his father in disbelief.\n “God help her!” Danny shouted.\n “Leave the girl be.” Her dad nodded sagely. “She\u0027s got more important affairs to tend to than a mere football match. Our Haley knows what she needs to do.”\n Haley scampered back out into the cold, winding her scarf about her neck as she went, the sound of hooting, cheering, and teasing about “affairs” sounding at her back.\n Chapter Two\n Argyll, Scotland. 1646\n The branches of the old rowan barely bore his weight as he scaled them, and yet the wind in the leaves made more of a rustle than MacColla. It was a moonless night and he felt his way, clinging closer to the trunk as the branches grew thinner and more fibrous with his ascent. Just as the treetop began to stoop with the burden, he saw the roof materialize from the darkness.\n It was a ruinous old structure nestled among the trees, a stout, near-windowless tower house, despite its grand title of Inveraray Castle. During the day, wooden steps bypassed the ground floor to lead to the entrance via the great hall on the second story. As such, invited guests wouldn\u0027t have to endure the unsightly cellars and vaulted kitchen, and the uninvited would be denied entry when the staircase was retracted at night.\n MacColla\u0027s laugh was low and quiet. He would, most assuredly, be considered among the uninvited, and yet the fools must\u0027ve thought some removable steps to be adequate security, for there were no guardsmen to be seen.\n There were no suitable windows to climb to from the ground, leaving the roof as the second best access point. He studied it from his perch. A dormer bearing a single door was the only thing that interrupted the silhouette of the sharp peak. A low stone parapet flanked a thin walkway along the roof\u0027s edge, presumably to prevent guardsmen from falling the five stories to their death. Faint starlight shimmered in small patches all around, captured by the night\u0027s dew. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-3.html","bookId":1617,"book":{"id":1617,"title":"Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Warrior of the Highlands (Highlands #3) \n While doing research for her dissertation, graduate student Haley Fitzpatrick stumbles upon a strange artifact—which sends her back in time to old Scotland, directly into the path of the notorious Alasdair MacColla, a warrior known for his enormous physical presence and bloodthirsty reputation. \n Assuming that this woman with the mysterious accent is an enemy spy, MacColla promptly kidnaps her.
