{"id":2373,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11 Goodbye to old friends","content":"　　One day we were waiting outside one of the London parks when a dirty old cab drove up beside ours．The horse was brown，with bones that showed through her coat．I was eating some hay and the wind took a little of it her way．The poor animal put out her long thin neck and picked it up，then turned and looked for more．There was a hopeless look in her dull eye and I wondered where I\u0027d seen her before．Then she looked straight at me． 　　\u0027Black Beauty，is that you？\u0027she said． 　　It was Ginger！But how different she looked！Her face，which was once so full of life，was now miserable and full of pain，and her breathing was very bad． 　　I moved closer to her so that we could have a quiet talk，and it was a sad story that she told me．After twelve months\u0027rest at Earlshall she was considered to be ready to work again，and was sold to a gentleman．She got on well for a little while，but after a long gallop one day，she became ill again．She was rested，was seen by a horse-doctor，then sold．In this way，she went from owner to owner several times，each one poorer than the one before． 　　\u0027So at last I was bought by a man who keeps a number of cabs and horses，and hires them out，\u0027said Ginger．\u0027You look happy and comfortable with life as a cab horse，and I\u0027m glad，but it\u0027s different for me． They whip me and work me seven days a week．They say that they paid more for me than I was worth，and now they\u0027re trying to get their money back by working me until I drop．\u0027 　　\u0027You used to stand up and fight when people were cruel to you， \u0027I said． 　　\u0027Yes，I did once，\u0027said Ginger．\u0027 But men are stronger than we are，and if they\u0027re cruel and have no feelings， then there\u0027s nothing we can do about it．Oh，I wish the end would come．I wish I was dead． \u0027 　　I was very sad．I put my nose against hers but could find nothing to say that would cheer her up．I think she was pleased to see me，because she said，\u0027You\u0027re the only friend I ever had．\u0027 　　A few weeks after this，a cart with a dead horse in it passed by our cab stand．It was a brown horse with a long thin neck，and I believe it was Ginger．I hoped it was，because then her troubles would be over． * * * 　　There was one day when we were very busy．First a fat gentle-man with a large bag wanted to go to Bishopsgate Station；then we were called by a lady who wanted to be taken to Regent\u0027s Park；then a man jumped into the cab and called out，\u0027Bow Street Police Station， quick！\u0027 　　After another journey or two，we came back to the cab stand and Jerry gave me some food，saying，\u0027We must eat when we can on days like this，Jack．\u0027And he took out the meat and bread Polly had given him． 　　But neither of us had eaten many mouthfuls before a poor young woman came along the street．She was carrying a child and she looked lost and worried． 　　\u0027Can you tell me the way to St Thomas\u0027s Hospital，please？\u0027she asked．\u0027I have to take my little boy there，and I\u0027m a stranger in London．\u0027The little boy was crying as she spoke．\u0027He\u0027s in great pain and can\u0027t walk，but the doctor says that if I can get him to the hospital，then perhaps he\u0027ll get well again． 　　\u0027You can\u0027t carry him through the crowds，\u0027 said Jerry．\u0027 It\u0027s five kilometres，and that child is heavy．\u0027 　　I\u0027m strong，\u0027said the woman．\u0027I think I can manage，if I know the way．\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t do it．Just get into this cab and I\u0027ll drive you there．Don\u0027t you see that it\u0027s beginning to rain？\u0027 　　\u0027No，sir，I can\u0027t do that，\u0027she said．\u0027I\u0027ve only just enough money to get me home again．\u0027 　　\u0027Listen，\u0027said Jerry．\u0027 I\u0027ve got a wife and children at home，and I\u0027d be ashamed of myself if I let a woman and a sick child put themselves in danger．Get in the cab and I\u0027ll take you for nothing．\u0027 　　\u0027Oh，how kind you are！\u0027said the woman， and began to cry． 　　Jerry opened the door but two men ran up，calling out，\u0027Cab！\u0027 　　\u0027It\u0027s taken，\u0027said Jerry，but one man pushed past the wom-an and jumped in，followed by the other．\u0027This cab is already taken，gentlemen，\u0027Jerry said again，\u0027by this lady．\u0027 　　\u0027Lady！\u0027said one of the men unpleasantly，looking at the woman\u0027s poor clothes．\u0027She can wait．Our business is very im－portant，and anyway，we were in first，and we\u0027ll stay in．\u0027 　　A smile came over Jerry\u0027s face as he shut the cab door．\u0027Stay in as long as you like， gentlemen．I can wait while you rest yourselves．\u0027He walked over to the young woman who was standing nearby．\u0027They\u0027ll soon be gone，don\u0027t worry，\u0027he said， laughing． 　　And he was right．When the two men realized that they were going to have a very long wait， they got out， calling Jerry all kinds of bad names． After this， we were soon on our way to the hospital． 　　\u0027Thank you a thousand times，\u0027 said the young woman， as Jerry helped her out of the cab． 　　\u0027I hope your child will soon be better，\u0027 said Jerry．He watched her go in，then patted my neck．It was something he always did when he was pleased． 　　The rain was now coming down fast and，just as we were leaving the hospital， a lady came down the steps calling，\u0027Cab！\u0027Jerry seemed to know her at once． 　　\u0027Jerry Barker，is it you？\u0027 said the woman．\u0027I\u0027m very glad to find you here．It\u0027s difficult to get a cab in this part of London today．\u0027 　　\u0027I\u0027ll be proud to take you，\u0027said Jerry．\u0027Where do you want to go？\u0027 　　\u0027Paddington Station，\u0027said the woman． 　　We got to the station and went in under cover．The lady stood beside the cab talking to Jerry for some time，and I dis-covered that she was once Polly\u0027s mistress． 　　\u0027How do you like cab work in the winter？\u0027she asked Jerry．\u0027Polly was worried about your cough last year．\u0027 　　\u0027She worries because I work all hours and in all kinds of weather，\u0027said Jerry．\u0027But I get on all right，and I would be lost without horses to look after．\u0027 　　\u0027It would be wrong to harm your health in this work when you have a wife and two children，\u0027said the lady．\u0027There are many places where good drivers or grooms are wanted．If you ever decide to give up cab work，let me know．\u0027She put some-thing into his hand．\u0027There\u0027s some money for the children．\u0027 　　Jerry thanked her and，after leaving the station，we went * * * 　　Christmas and the New Year are no holidays for cab drivers and their horses．People go to parties and dances，and th6 work is often late Sometimes driver and horse have to wait for hours，shaking with cold． 　　We had a lot of late work during Christmas week and Jerry\u0027s cough was bad．On New Year\u0027s Eve we took two gentlemen to a house in the West End，and were told to come for them at eleven\u0027o clock．\u0027You may have to wait a few minutes，but don\u0027t be late，\u0027one of them said． 　　Jerry arrived at the right time and we waited．The wind was very cold and it was snowing．Jerry pulled one of my cloths higher over my neck， then walked up and down， trying to keep warm． 　　At half－past twelve，Jerry rang the door－bell and asked if the gentlemen still wanted the cab．The man at the door said，\u0027Oh，yes，you\u0027ll be wanted．\u0027 　　At one o\u0027clock the door opened and two men came out．They got in the cab without a word，and told Jerry where to drive．It was three kilometres away，and when the men got out they didn\u0027t say they were sorry for the long wait，but they were angry when Jerry made them pay for the extra waiting time．But it was money hard-earned． 　　When we got home，Jerry could not speak，and his cough was terrible，but he groomed me and made sure that I was warm and comfortable． 　　It was late the next morning before anyone came， and then it was only Harry．He cleaned us and gave us our food but was very quiet． Later that morning he came again， and this time Dolly came with him．She was crying，and I discovered from their conversation that Jerry was dangerously ill． 　　Two days passed， and only Harry and Dolly came to the sta-ble．On the third day，Mr Grant from the cab stand arrived when Harry was in the stable．\u0027I won\u0027t go to the house，boy，but how is your father？\u0027he said． 　　\u0027He\u0027s very bad，\u0027said Harry． 　　\u0027I\u0027m sorry to hear that，\u0027said Mr Grant．\u0027He\u0027s the best man I know．\u0027 　　But when he came the next day，Harry was able to tell him，\u0027Father is better today．Mother hopes he will get over it soon．\u0027 　　\u0027Thank God！\u0027 said Mr Grant． He was a kind man， and did a lot to help the family during this time，because while Jerry was ill，he was earning no money，and we all had to eat． 　　Jerry got slowly better，but the doctor said he must never do cab work again．The children talked a lot about what their mother and father would do，but a few days later Dolly ran into the stable to find Harry． 　　\u0027There\u0027s a letter from Mrs Fowler，mother\u0027s old mistress！\u0027said Dolly．\u0027She wants father to be her carriage driver，and we\u0027re going to live in a cottage in the country——with chick-ens，and apple trees，and everything！\u0027 　　This was bad news for me．I was not young now，and could not hope for a better master than Jerry，although Mr Grant promised to find a comfortable place for me． 　　I never saw Jerry again and was very sorry to leave． 　 11 告别老友 　 　　一天我们在伦敦的一个公园门外等客，一辆又脏又旧的车从我们身旁经过。那马是棕色的，瘦骨嶙峋。我正在吃草，风把几根草刮到她那边。可怜的家伙伸着她又瘦又长的脖子把草叼了起来，又转过头来找别的草吃。在她黯淡的眼睛中有一股绝望的神情，我寻思自己以前在哪儿见过它。她也定定地看着我。 　　“黑骏马，是你吗？”她说。 　　是金儿！可她变化多大呀！她的脸，曾经是那么有生气的一张脸，现在悲惨而痛楚，她的呼吸也非常不好。 　　我凑近它，这样我们可以小声交谈。她给我讲了一个悲伤的故事。在沙尔伯爵庄园休养了一年后，主人认为她又能干活了，就把她卖给了一位先生。她开始还好，但是有一天经过长时间奔跑后，她又病了。她停止工作，看了医生，又被卖掉了。这样，她被从这个人卖到那个人，一个不如一个。 　　“最后我被一个有好多辆车和马供出租的人买下了，”金儿说。“看样子你拉车也挺高兴、挺舒服，我也为你高兴，可生活对我就不同了。他们抽打我，让我一周工作7天。他们说买我不值，现在他们要我拼命工作，帮他们把钱挣回来，直到我倒下。” 　　“你以前对残酷的人都是奋起斗争的呀！”我说。 　　“是的，我曾经这样做过。”金儿说。“可是人比我们强大，如果他们残暴无情的话，我们就没办法了。哦，我希望死期快点来。真希望我已经死了。” 　　我非常难过。我把鼻子贴着她的鼻子，可不知道说什么才能让她振作起来。我想她见到我很高兴，因为她说：“你是我曾有过的唯一的朋友。” 　　几个星期以后，一辆拉着一匹死马的车从我们的车站旁经过。那是一匹棕色的马，有着又瘦又长的脖子，我相信那是金儿。我希望如此，因为那样她的一切苦难就都结束了。 * * * 　　有一天我们非常忙。先是一个带大包的胖先生想去比少普盖特火车站；然后一位太太要我们拉她去雷根特公园；再后是一个人跳上车喊道：“波街警察局。快点！” 　　又跑了一两趟后，我们回到车站，杰利喂了我一些食物，说：“当我们这样工作时，我们必须得抽空就吃东西，杰克。”说着他掏出波莉给他的肉和面包来吃。 　　我们俩都还没吃上几口，一个可怜的年轻女人就沿街道走过来了。她抱着一个小孩，看上去不知所措，忧心忡忡。 　　“您能告诉我去圣托马斯医院怎么走吗？”她问。“我得带我的儿子去医院，我是外地人。”小男孩在她说话时一直哭闹着。“他疼得连路都走不了，大夫说如果把他送到医院，也许他会好起来的。” 　　“你没法儿抱着他穿过这么挤的人群，”杰利说。“医院有5公里远，再说孩子又重。” 　　“我有力气，”女人说，“我觉得我能走到，只要知道路怎么走。” 　　“你没法儿自己去。上车吧，我送你去。你没看到开始下雨了吗？” 　　“不，先生，我不能坐您的车，”她说。“我只剩下回家的钱了。” 　　“听我说，”杰利说，“我家里有老婆孩子，如果我眼看着一个妇女和她生病的孩子处于危险之中而不顾，我会非常羞耻的。上车吧，我免费送你们。”“噢，您太好了！”妇女说着，哭了起来。 　　杰利打开车门，这当儿两个男人跑了过来，喊着：“马车！” 　　“已经有人要了！”杰利说，可是一个男人冲到妇女前面跳上了车，另一个也跳了上来。“这车已经有人要了，先生们。”杰利又说了一遍，“这位女士要了。” 　　“女士！”其中一个男人不高兴地说，一边看着妇女那破旧的衣服。“她可以等，我们的事情非常重要，再说，是我们先上的车，我们就在车上呆着。” 　　杰利听罢，脸上掠过一丝微笑，他关上车门说：“爱呆多久呆多久吧！先生们。在里面歇着好了。我等着你们。”然后他向站在旁边的年轻妇女走过去。“他们很快就会走的，别担心！”他说着，笑起来。 　　他说对了。那两个男人意识到他们面临着漫长的等待，就用各种难听的话骂着杰利，钻出车门。然后很快我们就向医院赶去。 　　“非常非常感谢您，”杰利把她扶出车时年轻女人说道。 　　“我希望你的孩子能很快恢复健康。”杰利说。他看着她进了医院，然后拍了拍我的脖子。当他遇上高兴事儿时，他总爱这么做。 　　当时雨下得正大，正当我们要离开医院时，一个女士走下台阶，叫道：“马车！”杰利似乎马上认出了她。 　　“杰利·巴克尔，是你吗？”她说。“真高兴在这儿遇到你。今天在这一带很难叫到车。” 　　“能拉您我很荣幸！”杰利说，“您要去哪儿？” 　　“帕丁顿车站。”女士说。 　　我们到了车站，进入能避雨的地方。女士站在车旁和杰利说了一会儿话。我发现她曾是波莉的女主人。 　　“冬天赶车怎么样？”她问杰利。“波莉去年很担心你的咳嗽病。” 　　“她担心是因为我得在各种气候条件下长时间工作。”杰利说。“不过我适应得不错。再说要是不照顾马，我会很失落的。” 　　“可是你有妻子和两个孩子，把你的健康耗费在这项工作上是错误的，”女士说，“还有很多地方需要好车夫、好马夫。什么时候你打算不再干这活儿了，就告诉我。”她往他手里放了点东西，“这是给孩子们的钱。” 　　杰利谢了她，然后我们就离开车站回家了。 * * * 　　对于马夫和他们的马来说，圣诞节和新年是不算休息日的。人们去聚会、跳舞，我们的活儿都比较晚。有时车夫和马匹不得不等上几个小时，冻得发抖。 　　圣诞节那一周，我们有很多晚活儿。杰利的咳嗽加剧了。新年前夜，我们把两位先生送到西区一座房子，他们叫我们11点来接。“你们可能得等上几分钟，可是不能迟到。”他们中的一个说。 　　杰利正点到达，我们等着。风很冷，又下着雪。杰利把我身上的一块盖布拉高罩住我的脖子，他自己则走来走去，试图保持温暖。 　　十二点半了，杰利按门铃问那两位先生是否还想要车。门房答道：“噢，是的，他们还会需要你。” 　　一点了，门开了，两个男人走了出来。他们坐进车里，什么也没说，只告诉杰利到哪儿去。路有三公里远，到下车时他们也没有为让我们等了这么长时间而说句抱歉的话，反而因为杰利让他们付超时等候费而生了气。我们挣的真是辛苦钱。 　　我们回到家时，杰利连话也说不出来了，他咳得厉害极了，但他还是给我刷洗了一遍，以确保我温暖、舒适。 　　第二天早上到很晚还没有人来马厩，最后只有哈利来了。他把我们收拾了一遍，又喂了我们些吃的，却一言不发。上午晚些时候他又来了一趟，这回多莉也一起来了。她哭着，从他们的交谈中，我发觉杰利病情很危险。 　　两天过去了，只有哈利和多莉来马厩。第三天，车站的格兰特先生来了，哈利正站在马厩里。“我不进屋了，孩子，你父亲怎么样了？”他问。 　　“他糟透了，”哈利说。 　　“我真难过，”格兰特先生说。“他是我所认识的最好的人。” 　　不过第二天当他来时，哈利已能告诉他说：“爸爸今天好点了，妈妈希望他的病很快能好。” 　　“感谢上帝！”格兰特先生说。他是个善良的人，而且在这期间帮了这家人很多忙，因为杰利病了，就没法挣钱，可我们都得吃饭。 　　杰利慢慢地好起来了，可医生要他再也别干这行了。孩子们经常讨论爸爸妈妈将要做什么，几天后多莉跑进马厩找哈利。 　　“妈妈以前的女主人弗乐太太来了一封信！”多莉说。“她要爸爸做她的车夫，我们将住在乡村小屋里，有小鸡、苹果树，和一切！” 　　对我来说，这可不是好消息。我现在不再年轻了，也不可能遇上比杰利更好的主人了，尽管格兰特先生保证他会为我找一个好主儿。 　　我再也没有见到过杰利，离开他我非常难过。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/536/3508.html","bookId":88,"book":{"id":88,"title":"黑骏马 Black Beauty","description":"简介：
