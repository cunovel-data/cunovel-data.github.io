{"id":2372,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10 A London cab horse","content":"　　Jerry Barker was a small man，but well－made and quick in all his movements．He lived in London and was a cab driver．Jerry\u0027s wife，Polly，was a little woman with smooth dark hair and dark eyes．His son，Harry，was nearly twelve years old， and was a tall，good－tempered boy．His daughter，Dolly，was eight，and she looked just like her mother．\\n\\n 　　Jerry had his own cab and two horses，which he drove and groomed himself．His other horse was a tall，white animal called Captain．The next morning，Polly and Dolly came to see me．Harry had helped his father since early that morning and had already decided that I would be a good horse．Polly brought me a piece of apple and Dolly brought me some bread．\\n\\n 　　\u0027We\u0027ll call him Jack，after the old one，\u0027said Jerry．\u0027Shall we，Polly？\u0027\\n\\n 　　\u0027Yes，\u0027she said．\u0027I like to keep a good name going．\u0027\\n\\n 　　Captain went out in the cab all morning and I went out in the afternoon．Jerry took a lot of care to make sure that my col－lar and bridle were comfortable——and there was no bearing rein！\\n\\n 　　We went to the cab stand where the other cabs were waiting for passengers，and took our place at the back of the last cab．Several of the other drivers came to look at me．\\n\\n 　　\u0027Too handsome，\u0027saia one．\u0027You\u0027ll find something wrong with him one morning．\u0027\\n\\n 　　Then a man in a grey coat and grey hat came up．His name was Grant，and he looked a happy，sensible kind of man．He had been longer on the cab stand than any of the other men，so they let him through to have a look at me，and waited for his opinion．\\n\\n 　　He looked me all over very carefully，then said：\\n\\n 　　\u0027He\u0027s the right kind for you，Jerry．I don\u0027t care what you paid for him，he\u0027ll be worth it．\u0027\\n\\n 　　My first week as a cab horse was very hard．I was not used to London—the noise，the hurry，the crowds of horses，carts and carriages．But Jerry was a good driver and soon discovered that I was willing to work and do my best．He never used the whip on me，and we soon understood each other as well as a horse and man can do．Jerry kept his horses clean and gave us plenty of food and fresh water，and on Sundays we rested．\\n\\n 　　I never knew a better man than my new master．He was kind and good-tempered，like John Manly．Harry was clever at stable work and always wanted to do what he could．Polly and Dolly came in the morning to brush out the cab，and to wash the glass，while Jerry gave Captain and me a grooming．There was a lot of laughing and fun between them，which all helped to keep Captain and me happy． The family came early in the morning because Jerry did not like lateness．It always made him angry when people wanted him to drive hard because of their own lateness．\\n\\n 　　One day，two wild-looking young men called to him．\\n\\n 　　\u0027Cabby！Hurry up，we\u0027re late for our train at Victoria．Get us there in time for the one o\u0027clock train and we\u0027ll pay you double！\u0027\\n\\n 　　\u0027I will take you at the usual speed，gentlemen，\u0027said Jerry．\\n\\n 　　\u0027Extra money doesn\u0027t pay for extra speed．\u0027\\n\\n 　　Larry\u0027s cab was standing next to ours．He opened the door and said，\u0027I\u0027m your man，gentlemen！My horse will get you there all right．\u0027And as he shut them in，with a smile at Jerry，he said，\u0027He always refuses to go faster than a trot！\u0027Then，whipping his horse hard，he went off as fast as he could．\\n\\n 　　Jerry patted me on the neck．\u0027Extra money won\u0027t pay for that kind of thing，will it，Jack？\u0027he said．\\n\\n 　　Although he was against hard driving to please careless peo－ple，he always went at a fair speed and was not against going faster if there was a good reason．\\n\\n 　　I remember one morning we were on the stand waiting for a passenger when a young man carrying a large suitcase went by．He stepped on a piece of apple which lay in the road，and fell down heavily．Jerry ran across the road and helped him up，then took him into a shop to sit him down．\\n\\n 　　Some time later，the young man，looking white and ill，came out again and called Jerry，so we went across the road．\\n\\n 　　\u0027Can you take me to the South－Eastern Railway？\u0027he said．\u0027My fall has made me late，and it\u0027s very important that I don\u0027t miss the twelve o\u0027clock train．I\u0027ll pay you extra if you can get me there in time．\u0027\\n\\n 　　\u0027We\u0027ll do our best，sir，\u0027said Jerry，and helped him into the cab．\\n\\n 　　It was always difficult to drive fast in the city in the middle were used to it，and no one was faster at getting through the carriages and carts，all moving at different speeds，going this way and that way．In and out，in and out we went，as fast as a horse can do it．And we got to the station just as the big clock showed eight minutes to twelve．\\n\\n 　　\u0027We\u0027re in time！\u0027said the young man，happily．\u0027Thank you，my friend，and your good horse，too．Take this extra money—\u0027\\n\\n 　　\u0027No，sir，said Jerry．\u0027Thank you，but it isn\u0027t necessary．I\u0027m glad we were in time—now hurry and catch your train．\u0027\\n\\n 　　When we got back to the cab stand，the other men were laughing because Jerry had driven hard to the train．\\n\\n 　　\u0027How much extra did he pay you，Jerry？\u0027said one driver．\\n\\n 　　\u0027Nothing，\u0027said Jerry．\u0027He offered me extra but I didn\u0027t take it．If Jack and I choose to have a quick run now and then，that\u0027s our business and not yours．\u0027\\n\\n 　　\u0027You\u0027ll never be a rich man then，\u0027said Larry．\\n\\n 　　\u0027Perhaps not，\u0027said Jerry，\u0027but I\u0027ll be a happy one！\u0027\\n\\n 　　\u0027And you，Larry，\u0027added Mr Grant，\u0027will die poor，because you spend too much money on new whips，beating your poor horse until it\u0027s exhausted—and then you have to buy another one．\u0027\\n\\n 　　\u0027well，I\u0027ve never had good luck with my horses，\u0027said Larry．\\n\\n 　　\u0027And you never will，\u0027said Mr Grant．\u0027Good Luck is very careful who she travels with，and mostly chooses those who are kind and sensible．That\u0027s my experience，anyway．\u0027\\n\\n 　　He turned round again to his newspaper，and the other men went back to their cabs．\\n\\n * * *\\n\\n 　　Winter came early，with snow，rain or strong winds almost ev－ery day for weeks．Jerry sometimes went to a coffee－shop near the cab stand，and sometimes Dolly came with some hot soup that Polly had made for him．\\n\\n 　　One cold windy day，Dolly was waiting for Jerry to finish his soup when a gentleman came towards us．Jerry started to give the soup bowl back to Dolly and was just going to take off my warm cloth when the man said，\u0027No，no，finish your soup，my friend．I can wait in the cab until you\u0027ve finished．\u0027Jerry thanked him，then came back to Dolly．\\n\\n 　　\u0027That\u0027s a real gentleman\u0027Dolly，\u0027he said．\u0027He has time and thought for the comfort of a poor cab driver．\u0027\\n\\n 　　Jerry finished his soup，then we took the man to Clapham．After that，he took our cab several times，and often came to pat me．It was very unusual for anyone to notice a cab horse，and I was grateful．\\n\\n 　　Another day，the gentleman saw a cart with two horses standing in the street．The driver was not with them and I don\u0027t know how long they had been standing there．However，they decided to move on a few steps．\\n\\n 　　Suddenly，the cart driver ran out of a building and caught them．He seemed very angry and began to whip the horses hard，even beating them around the head．\\n\\n 　　Our gentleman saw him and walked quickly across．\u0027Stop that at once，or I\u0027ll call the police！\u0027he said．\\n\\n 　　The driver was drunk and he began to shout，but he stopped whipping the horses．Meanwhile，our gentleman wrote down the name and address that was on the side of the cart．\\n\\n 　　\u0027Why do you want that？\u0027shouted the driver．\\n\\n 　　Our gentleman didn\u0027t answer．He came back to the cab．\u0027Many people have thanked me fof telling them how their horses have been used，\u0027he told Jerry．\\n\\n 　　\u0027I wish there were more gentlemen like you，sir，said Jerry．\u0027They\u0027re needed in this city．\u0027\\n\\n 　\\n\\n 10 在伦敦拉出租马车\\n\\n 　\\n\\n 　　杰利·巴克尔是个小个儿男人，但他结实、健壮、动作敏捷。他住在伦敦，是个赶出租马车的。杰利的妻子波莉身材小巧，有一头光滑的黑发和一双乌黑的眼睛。他儿子叫哈利，快12岁了，个子高高的，脾气挺好。女儿多莉8岁，看上去和妈妈很像。\\n\\n 　　杰利有自己的一辆马车和两匹马，他自己赶马、料理马。他的另外一匹马高大洁白，名叫上尉。第二天上午，波莉和多莉来看我。哈利从那天一大早就帮父亲干活儿，已断定我是匹好马。波利给我带来一片苹果，多莉给我拿了些面包。\\n\\n 　　“我们叫他杰克吧，和上回那匹一样，”杰利说，“好吗，波莉？”\\n\\n 　　“好，”她说，“我喜欢沿用一个好名字。”\\n\\n 　　上尉整个上午都出去拉车，我则是下午当班。杰利非常注意我的轭具和笼头是否舒服——而且也没有绳套儿啦！\\n\\n 　　我们去了车站，那儿有其他的马车在等候旅客，我们站在了最后一辆车的后面。几个马车夫过来看我。\\n\\n 　　“太俊了，”一个说，“有一天早上醒来你会发现他有毛病。”\\n\\n 　　一个穿灰上衣、戴灰帽的男人走上前来。他叫格兰特，看上去是那种快活、聪明的人。他在车站的时间比其他人都长，所以大家都让开道让他过来看看我，等着听他的意见。\\n\\n 　　他非常仔细地打量了我，然后说：\\n\\n 　　“他正适合你，杰利。不管你付了多少钱，他都值。”\\n\\n 　　我拉车的第一个星期很辛苦。我不习惯伦敦——噪音、匆忙、拥挤的马匹和车辆。但是杰利是个好车夫，很快就发现我愿意工作并且不偷懒。他对我从不用鞭子。很快我们就彼此理解了，那是一匹马和一个人之间所能达到的最深的理解。杰利总把我们收拾得干干净净，还给我们足够的吃食和清水，星期日我们还休息。\\n\\n 　　我从没见过比我的新主人更好的人。他善良、脾气好，就像约翰·曼利。哈利对马厩的活儿很精通，总是在卖力地做。波莉和多莉早上来把马车刷干净、擦玻璃，同时杰利给我和上尉刷洗。这一家大小之间总是笑声不断，乐趣盎然，这一切使我和上尉也很快活。\\n\\n 　　这一家子早上总是来得很早，因为杰利不喜欢迟到。杰利经常为那些自己晚了，光会催他快赶车的人生气。\\n\\n 　　一天，两个野里野气的年轻人喊他。\\n\\n 　　“车夫，快点，我们赶维多利亚火车站一点钟的火车，快误点了。快送我们去。双倍付钱！”\\n\\n 　　“我只用正常速度送你们，先生们，”杰利说，“多付钱买不来超速度。”\\n\\n 　　拉利的车就在我们旁边，他打开门说：“我为你们效劳，先生们！我的马能保证把你们按时送到。”拉利把他们送进车，关门时，笑着看着杰利说：“他总是不愿意比小跑更快一点！”然后，他狠命抽打着他的马，飞快地跑走了。杰利拍着我的脖子说：“多付钱也买不来那种事，对吗，杰克？”\\n\\n 　　虽然他反对死命狂奔以取悦那些粗心大意的人，而总是按正常速度行驶，但是遇上理由正当时，他也不反对赶时间。\\n\\n 　　我记得一天早上，我们正站在车站等旅客，一个小伙子拎着一只大箱子从旁边走过。他踩在了路上的一片苹果上，重重地摔倒了。杰利跑过去帮助他站起来，然后扶他到一家店铺里坐下。\\n\\n 　　过了一会儿，那小伙子苍白、病弱地走出店铺叫杰利，我们走了过去。\\n\\n 　　“你能送我到东南火车站吗？”他说，“我跌了这一跤，要迟到了，事情很重要，我不能误12点的火车。如果你能及时送我过去，我会多付钱给你。”\\n\\n 　　“我们会尽力的，先生，”杰利说，扶他上了车。\\n\\n 　　中午在城市中驾车是很难跑快的，街道上满是车辆。但是杰利和我已习惯了，没人能比我们更快了。在这样的街上，所有的车都以不同的速度向不同的方向行驶着，我们在车流中穿行，进进出出，出出进进，以一匹马能达到的最快速度向前跑。当我们到达车站时，大钟正指向差8分钟12点。\\n\\n 　　“我们及时到了！”小伙子高兴地说。“谢谢你，我的朋友，也谢谢你的好马。拿着，这是小费……”\\n\\n 　　“不，先生，”杰利说，“谢谢你，可是小费就不必了。我很高兴能及时赶到——现在快去赶你的火车吧。”\\n\\n 　　当我们回到车站时，其他人都在大笑，因为杰利刚才为追火车而拼命赶车了。\\n\\n 　　“他付了多少小费给你，杰利？”一个车夫说。\\n\\n 　　“一个子儿也没有。”杰利说，“他要给我小费，但是我没拿。如果杰克和我愿意时不时快跑一下，那也是我们的事，你们管不着。”\\n\\n 　　“你这样永远也成不了富翁，”拉利说。\\n\\n 　　“也许成不了，”杰利说，“但我会是个快乐的人！”\\n\\n 　　“而你呢，拉利，”格兰特先生加了一句，“会贫穷地死去，因为你花太多钱买新鞭子，把你可怜的马抽个半死——然后你就得再买一匹。”\\n\\n 　　“唉，我靠我的马从没走过运，”拉利说。\\n\\n 　　“你走不了运，”格兰特先生说，“好运挑选良伴，挑的常是那些善良、聪明的人。反正这是我的经验。”\\n\\n 　　他又转回身去看报纸了，其他人也回到了自己的车里。\\n\\n * * *\\n\\n 　　冬天来得早，带着雪、雨和强劲的风，差不多连着几个星期都是如此。杰利有时去车站附近的一个咖啡店。有时多莉送来一些波莉给他做的热汤。\\n\\n 　　一个刮风的冷天，多莉正等着杰利喝汤，一个先生走了过来。杰利忙把汤碗递给多莉，正要揭我身上的盖布，那人说：“不，不，把汤喝完，我的朋友。我可以在车里等着你喝完。”杰利谢过他，回到多莉身旁。\\n\\n 　　“那是个真正的绅士，多莉，”他说，“他肯为一个可怜的赶车人的冷暖着想。”\\n\\n 　　杰利喝完了汤，我们就把那人拉到克莱范姆。后来他又坐了几次我们的车，常来拍拍我。有人这么注意一匹拉车的马可真少见。我对他心存感激。\\n\\n 　　又有一天，这位先生看见两匹马拉着一辆车站在街道上。车夫不在，我不知道他们已等了多久。不过，他们开始踱了几步。\\n\\n 　　突然，车夫从一栋楼里跑出来抓住了他们。他看上去很生气，狠狠地抽打起马，甚至抽打马头。\\n\\n 　　我们这位先生看见了他，就快步走过去。\\n\\n 　　“立刻住手，不然我喊警察了！”他说。\\n\\n 　　车夫醉了，他喊叫起来，不过他不再抽马了。同时，我们的先生抄下了在车身一侧的名字和地址。\\n\\n 　　“你干嘛这样？”车夫喊道。\\n\\n 　　我们的先生没有回答。他走回我们的车。“很多人都感谢我，因为我告诉了他们，他们的马是被怎样使用的。”他对杰利说。\\n\\n 　　“我希望有更多的人像您，先生，”杰利说，“这座城市需要这样的人。”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/536/3507.html","bookId":88,"book":{"id":88,"title":"黑骏马 Black Beauty","description":"简介：
