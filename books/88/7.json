{"id":2369,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7 Joe Green","content":"　　The rest of our journey was very easy，and the next evening we reached the house of our master\u0027s friend，where a groom took us to a comfortable stable．We stayed two or three days，then returned home．John was glad to see us，and we were glad to see him． 　　\u0027I wonder who will come in my place，\u0027said James． 　　\u0027Little Joe Green，\u0027said John．\u0027He\u0027s only fourteen and a half but he has a kind heart and wants to come，so I\u0027ve agreed to try him for six weeks．\u0027 　　The next day，Joe Green came to learn all he could before James left．He was a nice happy boy and always came to work singing．But then the day came when James had to leave us． 　　\u0027I\u0027m leaving a lot behind，\u0027he said sadly to John．\u0027My mother，and you，a good master and mistress，and the horses．And I shan\u0027t know anybody at the new place．\u0027 　　\u0027It\u0027s hard to leave your home for the first time，\u0027said John，\u0027but if you get on well—which I\u0027m sure you will——your moth－er will be proud of you．\u0027 　　Everyone was sorry to lose James，but Joe tried hard to learn，and John was pleased with him． * * * 　　One night I woke up to hear the stable bell ringing loudly．I heard the door open at John\u0027s house，and his feet running up to the Hall．He was back quickly． 　　\u0027Wake up，Beauty！\u0027he said，coming into the stable．\u0027We must go quickly now！\u0027And before I could think，he had the saddle on my back and the bridle on my head． 　　The master was waiting at the Hall door with a letter in his hand．\u0027Ride for your life，John！\u0027he said．\u0027Give this to Dr White，then rest your horse and be back as soon as you can．Mrs Gordon is very ill．\u0027 　　Away went John and I，through the Park，through the vil－lage，and down the hill．There was a long piece of flat road by the riverside，and John said，\u0027Now Beauty，do your best！\u0027I needed no whip，and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could——perhaps even faster than my grandfather，who won the race at Newrmarket．When we came to the bridge，John slowed me down a little and patted my neck．\u0027Well done，Beauty！\u0027he said． 　　Then I was off again，as fast as before．The air was cold and the moon was bright，and it was a pleasant night．We went through a village，then a dark wood，then uphill，then down－hill，and after twelve kilometres，we came to the town． 　　It was three o\u0027clock when we stopped by Dr White\u0027s door．John rang the bell，then knocked on the door like thunder．A window was pushed up and Dr White\u0027s head appeared．\u0027What do you want？\u0027he said． 　　\u0027Mrs Gordon is very ill，\u0027said John．\u0027You must come at once，or she\u0027ll die．Here\u0027s a letter．\u0027 　　The doctor was soon at the door．\u0027My horse has been out all day and is exhausted．Can I take yours？\u0027 　　\u0027My master told me to rest him，\u0027said John，\u0027but take him if you think it\u0027s best，sir．\u0027 　　\u0027I\u0027ll soon be ready，\u0027said the doctor． 　　John stood by me and patted my neck．I was very hot．Then the doctor came out with his riding whip． 　　\u0027You won\u0027t need that，sir，\u0027said John．\u0027Black Beauty will go until he drops．\u0027 　　The doctor was a heavier man than John，and not so good a rider，but I did my very best．Joe was waiting at the gate and the master was at the Hall door．He did not say a word．The doctor went into the house with him，and Joe led me to the stable． 　　My legs were shaking and there was not a dry hair on my body．The water ran down my legs and I was hot all over．Poor Joe！He was young and knew very little．He did the best he could，cleaning my legs and my chest，but he did not put a warm cloth on me；he thought I was so hot that I would not like it．He gave me some cold water to drink，then he gave me some food and went away． 　　Soon I began to shake and tremble with cold，and I ached all over．I wished John was there，but he had twelve kilometres to walk，so I tried to sleep． 　　After a long time，I heard John at the door．I gave a low cry，and he was at my side in a moment．I could not tell him how I felt，but he seemed to know immediately．He covered me with three warm cloths，then ran for some hot water and made me a warm drink． 　　John seemed very angry．\u0027Stupid boy！\u0027he said to himself，over and over again．\u0027No cloth put on，and I suppose the water was cold too．Boys are no good！\u0027 　　I became very ill，and could not breathe without pain．John looked after me day and night，and my master often came to see me too． 　　\u0027My poor Beauty，\u0027he said one day．\u0027My good horse，you saved your mistress\u0027s life．Yes，you saved her life．\u0027 　　I was very glad to hear that．John told my master that he never saw a horse go so fast． 　　One night，Tom Green，Joe\u0027s father，came to help John give me my medicine，then stayed for a while．At first both men were silent，then Tom said，\u0027John，please say a kind word to Joe．The boy is heart－broken；he can\u0027t eat his meals，and he can\u0027t smile．He knows it\u0027s his fault Beauty is ill，but he did his best．He says if Beauty dies，no one will ever speak to him again．But he\u0027s not a bad boy．\u0027 　　After a short pause，John said，\u0027I know he meant no harm，but I\u0027m proud of that horse，and I hate to think his life may be thrown away like this．But I\u0027ll give the boy a kind word to－morrow，if Beauty is better．\u0027 　　I heard no more of this conversation，as the medicine did well and sent me to sleep，and in the morning I fell much bet－ter． 　　Joe learned quickly after this，and was so careful that John began to give him many things to do．One day，John was out and the master wanted a letter taken immediately to a gentle－man\u0027s house about five kilometres away．He told Joe to saddle me and take it． 　　The letter was delivered and we were returning through a field where we saw a cart full of bricks．They were so heavy that the wheels of the cart were half－buried in the soft ground，and the horses could not move the cart at all．The man leading the horses was shouting and whipping them without stopping． 　　\u0027Don\u0027t whip the horses like that，\u0027Joe shouted at him．\u0027The wheels are half-buried and won\u0027t move．I\u0027ll help you take some bricks out to make the cart lighter．\u0027 　　\u0027Mind your own business！\u0027said the man angrily．He was in a terrible temper and more than half－drunk． 　　Joe turned me，and we galloped towards the house of the brickmaker，Mr Clay．Joe knocked on the door． 　　The door opened．\u0027Hallo，young man，\u0027began Mr Clay． 　　\u0027There\u0027s a man in your field whipping two horses to death！\u0027Joe told him，his voice shaking with anger．\u0027I told him to stop，but he wouldn\u0027t．I offered to help him lighten the cart，but he refused．I think he\u0027s drunk．Please go，sir！\u0027 　　\u0027I will！\u0027said the man，and hurried off． 　　When we got home，Joe told John all about it． 　　\u0027You did the right thing，\u0027said John．\u0027Many people would ride by and say it was none of their business．But cruelty is everybody\u0027s business．\u0027 　　Just before dinner，the master sent for Joe．The drunken man was accused of cruelty to horses and Joe was wanted to tell his story to the police． 　　\u0027I\u0027ll tell it gladly，\u0027said Joe． 　　We heard afterwards that the poor horses were so exhausted and so badly beaten that the man might have to go to prison． 　　Joe came across and gave me a friendly pat．\u0027We won\u0027t al－low cruelty，will we，old friend？\u0027he said． 　　And he seemed to have grown up suddenly． 　 7 乔·格林 　 　　接下来的旅途就简单多了，第二天晚上我们就到了主人的朋友家，一个马夫带我们到了一个舒适的马厩。我们住了两三天，然后回家。约翰又见到我们，很高兴，我们也是一样。 　　“不知道谁会来顶替我呢。”詹姆斯说。 　　“是小乔·格林，”约翰说。“他只有十四岁半，可是他善良，也愿意来，我已同意让他试6个星期的工。” 　　第二天，乔·格林来了。他得赶在詹姆斯走之前学会干所有的活计。他是个快活可爱的孩子，来干活时老是唱着歌。但终于还是到了詹姆斯离开我们的时候。 　　“我舍弃了这么多，”他伤心地对约翰说。“我妈妈，你，一个好主人和太太，还有这些马。在新的地方我谁也不认识。” 　　“第一次离家的确不容易，”约翰说，“但如果你能适应——我相信你能——你妈妈会为你自豪的。” 　　大家都为詹姆斯的离开而难过。不过乔在很努力地学，约翰和他在一起挺高兴。 * * * 　　一天夜里，我醒来时，马厩的铃猛响着。我听见约翰住的房子的门开了，从脚步声可以听出他飞快地向大宅跑去。很快他又回来了。 　　“醒醒，黑骏马！”他说着，冲进马厩里。“我们必须马上走！”我还没来得及想，他就把马鞍备好，笼头也给我戴上了。 　　主人在大宅门口等着，手里拿着一封信。“拼命跑，约翰！”他说。“把这封信交给怀特大夫，让马歇歇，然后再尽快赶回来。太太病得很厉害。” 　　我和约翰冲了出来，穿过庄园，穿过村子，冲下山去。河边的一长段路很平坦，约翰说：“现在，黑骏马，你尽力吧！”我不需鞭打，尽我所能飞奔了2英里——也许比我那得了纽马克特赛马冠军的爷爷跑得还快。当我们来到桥边时，约翰让我稍微放慢速度，拍着我的脖子说：“真不错，黑骏马！” 　　我又跑了起来，和刚才一样快。空气寒冷，月光皎洁，这是一个令人愉快的夜晚。我们穿过了一个村子，然后是一片黑黢黢的林子，然后上山、下山，跑了12公里后，我们进了城。 　　当我们停在怀特大夫的门前时，已是凌晨3点了。约翰按了门铃，然后把门擂得像打雷一样响。一扇窗子被推上去，怀特大夫的头探了出来。“你要干什么？”他说。 　　“高顿太太病得很厉害，”约翰说。“您必须马上来，先生，不然她会死的！这是信。” 　　医生很快出现在门口。“我的马出去了一整天，已经很累了，我能骑你的马吗？” 　　“我主人让我歇一歇马，”约翰说，“不过如果您觉得这样最好，那就骑吧，先生。” 　　“我很快就准备好，”医生说。 　　约翰站在我身旁，拍着我的脖子，我热得要命。医生带着鞭子出来了。 　　“您不需要用鞭子，先生，”约翰说，“黑骏马跑死也不会停下来。” 　　医生比约翰重，而且骑术不太好，不过我拼尽全力。乔在大门口等着，主人则在大宅门口等着。他一言不发。医生随他进了房间，乔把我带回马厩。 　　我的腿在瑟瑟发抖，全身上下没有一根毛是于的。汗水顺着腿流下来，我全身热得要命。可怜的乔！他小小年纪，懂得很少。他尽他所能，洗干净我的腿和胸，可是没有给我盖上暖和的布，他觉得我已经很热了，可能不会喜欢盖布。他喂了我一些冷水和一些食物，然后就走开了。 　　很快我开始发抖，冷得直哆嚏，浑身上下都痛。我真希望约翰在，但是，他得步行12公里，我只好试着睡觉。 　　过了很久，我听见约的在门口。我低低地呜咽了一声，他立刻来到我身旁。我没法儿告诉他我的感觉，但他似乎立刻就明白了。他给我盖了3块暖和的布，跑去取了些热水让我趁热喝下。 　　约翰看上去很生气。“傻小子！”他一遍又一遍地自言自语着。“一块布也不盖，估计水也是冷的。小孩子真不像话！” 　　我病得很厉害，每呼吸一下都觉得疼。约翰夜以继日地看护我，主人也常来看望我。 　　“我可怜的黑骏马！”一天他说。“我的好马，你救了你女主人的命。是啊，你救了她的命。” 　　我听见这个很高兴。约翰告诉主人说他从没见过哪匹马跑得这么快。 　　一个晚上，汤姆·格林，乔的爸爸，来帮约翰给我喂药，然后又多呆了会儿。起先两个男人都沉默着，然后汤姆说：“约翰，请对乔说句好话吧。这孩子心都碎了，他吃不下饭，也不笑了。他知道黑骏马生病是他的错，不过他尽力而为了。他说如果黑骏马死了，就不会有人再理他了。可他不是个坏孩子。” 　　短暂的沉默之后，约翰说：“我知道他不是故意的，但是我以这匹马为荣，我不能忍受就这么看着他死去。不过，明天我会对这孩子说句好话，如果黑骏马能好一点儿。” 　　我没再听到下面的谈话，因为药开始起作用，我昏昏欲睡了。早上，我觉得好多了。 　　这件事之后，乔学习进步很快，而且特别仔细。约翰开始把很多事交给他去办。一天，约翰外出了，主人想把一封信立刻送到5公里外的一位先生家里，他吩咐乔给我备鞍，把信送去。 　　信被送到了。归途中，我们穿过一片田野，在那儿我们看见一辆装满砖头的马车。沉重的车身压得轮子的一半陷入了松软的地里。马根本拉不动车。赶车的人不断地喊叫，抽打着马匹。 　　“别抽得那么狠，”乔冲赶车人喊着，“轮子一半儿陷下去了，动不了啦。我帮你卸下些砖来，让车轻一点。” 　　“你少管闲事！”那人恼怒地说。他正大发脾气，而且已醉得可以了。 　　乔让我转过身，我们朝着制砖人克雷先生的房子飞奔过去。乔敲了门。 　　门开了。“喂！小伙子，”克雷先生开口道。 　　“你田里有个人快把两匹马抽死了！”乔告诉他，气得声音发抖。“我叫他住手，可他不听。我提出帮他把车弄轻些，他也不干。我看他是醉了。您去一下吧，先生！” 　　“我会去的！”克雷先生说，他立刻就赶了过去。 　　我们到家后，乔对约翰讲了整个事情。 　　“你做得对，”约翰说。“很多人会擦身而过，觉得那不关他们的事。但是制止残暴的行为是每个人都应该做的事。” 　　晚饭前，主人派人来叫乔。那个醉汉被指控虐待马匹，乔被叫去向警察讲述经过。 　　“我很乐意去讲一讲，”乔说。 　　事后，我们听说那两匹可怜的马已累得精疲力竭，还被打得半死。那人有可能要进监狱。 　　乔过来友好地拍了拍我。“我们不允许残暴的行为，是吗，我的老朋友？”他说。 　　他看上去一下子长大了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/536/3504.html","bookId":88,"book":{"id":88,"title":"黑骏马 Black Beauty","description":"简介：
