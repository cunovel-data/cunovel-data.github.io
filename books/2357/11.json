We\u0027re getting up in the world, Jennifer.\" Jennifer laughed. \"This isn\u0027t exactly getting up in the world, Father. I have a long way to go.\" He eyed her keenly. \"You\u0027ll make it. By the way, I went to visit Abraham Wilson last week.\" \"How is he getting along?\" \"Fine. They have him working in the prison machine shop. He asked me to give you his regards.\" \"I\u0027ll have to visit him myself one day soon.\" Father Ryan sat in his chair, staring at her, until Jennifer said, \"Is there something I can do for you, Father?\" He brightened. \"Ah, well, I know you must be busy, but now that you\u0027ve brought it up, a friend of mine has a bit of a problem. She was in an accident. I think you\u0027re just the one to help her.\" Automatically Jennifer replied, \"Have her come in and see me, Father.\" \"I think you\u0027ll have to go to her. She\u0027s a quadruple amputee.\" Connie Garrett lived in a small, neat apartment on Houston Street. The door was opened for Jennifer by an elderly white-haired woman wearing an apron. \"I\u0027m Martha Steele, Connie\u0027s aunt. I live with Connie. Please come in. She\u0027s expecting you.\" Jennifer walked into a meagerly furnished living room. Connie Garrett was propped up with pillows in a large armchair. Jennifer was shocked by her youth. For some reason, she had expected an older woman. Connie Garrett was about twenty-four, Jennifer\u0027s age. There was a wonderful radiance in her face, and Jennifer found it obscene that there was only a torso with no arms or legs attached to it. She repressed a shudder. Connie Garrett gave her a warm smile and said, \"Please sit down, Jennifer. May I call you Jennifer? Father Ryan has told me so much about you. And, of course, I\u0027ve seen you on television. I\u0027m so glad you could come.\" Jennifer started to reply, \"My pleasure,\" and realized how inane it would have sounded. She sat down in a soft comfortable chair opposite the young woman. \"Father Ryan said you were in an accident a few years ago. Do you want to tell me what happened?\" \"It was my fault, I\u0027m afraid. I was crossing an intersection and I stepped off the sidewalk and slipped and fell in front of a truck.\" \"How long ago was this?\" \"Three years ago last December. I was on my way to Bloomingdale\u0027s to do some Christmas shopping.\" \"What happened after the truck hit you?\" \"I don\u0027t remember anything. I woke up in the hospital. They told me that an ambulance brought me there. There was an injury to my spine. Then they found bone damage and it kept spreading until - \" She stopped and tried to shrug. It was a pitiful gesture. \"They tried to fit me with artificial limbs, but they don\u0027t work on me.\" \"Did you bring suit?\" She looked at Jennifer, puzzled. \"Father Ryan didn\u0027t tell you?\" \"Tell me what?\" \"My lawyer sued the utility company whose truck hit me, and we lost the case. We appealed and lost the appeal.\" Jennifer said, \"He should have mentioned that. If the appellate court turned you down, I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s nothing that can be done.\" Connie Garrett nodded. \"I didn\u0027t really believe there was. I just thought - well, Father Ryan said you could work miracles.\" \"That\u0027s his territory. I\u0027m only a lawyer.\" She was angry with Father Ryan for having given Connie Garrett false hope. Grimly, Jennifer decided she would have a talk with him. The older woman was hovering in the background. \"Can I offer you something, Miss Parker? Some tea and cake, perhaps?\" Jennifer suddenly realized she was hungry, for she had had no time for lunch. But she visualized sitting opposite Connie Garrett while she was being fed by hand, and she could not bear the thought. \"No, thanks,\" Jennifer lied. \"I just had lunch.\" All Jennifer wanted to do was get out of there as quickly as possible. She tried to think of some cheering note she could leave on, but there was nothing. Damn Father Ryan! \"I - I\u0027m really sorry. I wish I - \" Connie Garrett smiled and said, \"Please don\u0027t worry about it.\" It was the smile that did it. Jennifer was sure if she had been in Connie Garrett\u0027s place she would never have been able to smile. \"Who was your lawyer?\" Jennifer heard herself asking. \"Melvin Hutcherson. Do you know him?\" \"No, but I\u0027ll look him up.\" She went on, without meaning to, \"I\u0027ll have a talk with him.\" \"That would be so nice of you.\" There was warm appreciation in Connie Garrett\u0027s voice. Jennifer thought of what the girl\u0027s life must be like, sitting there totally helpless, day after day, month after month, year after year, unable to do anything for herself. \"I can\u0027t promise anything, I\u0027m afraid.\" \"Of course not. But do you know something, Jennifer? I feel better just because you came.\" Jennifer rose to her feet. It was a moment to shake hands, but there was no hand to shake. She said awkwardly, \"It was nice meeting you, Connie. You\u0027ll hear from me.\" On the way back to her office, Jennifer thought about Father Ryan and resolved that she would never succumb to his blandishments again. There was nothing anyone could do for that poor crippled girl, and to offer her any kind of hope was indecent. But she would keep her promise. She would talk to Melvin Hutcherson. When Jennifer returned to her office there was a long list of messages for her. She looked through them quickly, looking for a message from Adam Warner. There was none.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-11.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
