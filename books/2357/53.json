They sat at a front booth, and every time the door opened they automatically glanced up to check out the newcomers. Michael Moretti was in the back room, and while there was no current conflict among the Families, it was always better to play it safe.\\n\\n \"What happened to Jimmy?\" the giant Joseph Colella was asking.\\n\\n \"Astutatu-morte,\" Nick Vito told him. \"The dumb son of a bitch fell for the sister of a detective. The broad was stacked, I\u0027ll give her that. She and her dick brother talked Jimmy into a flip. Jimmy arranged for a sit-down with Mike and he wore a wire hidden in his pants leg.\"\\n\\n \"So what happened?\" Fiore asked.\\n\\n \"What happened was Jimmy got so nervous he had to pee. When he opened up his fly, the fuckin\u0027 wire came out.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, shit!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what Jimmy did. Mike turned him over to Gino. He used Jimmy\u0027s wire to strangle him. He went out suppilu suppilu - very slowly.\"\\n\\n The door opened and the four men looked up. It was the newspaper boy with the afternoon New York Post.\\n\\n Joseph Colella called out, \"Over here, sonny.\" He turned to the others. \"I wanna check the lineup at Hialeah. I got a hot horse runnin\u0027 today.\"\\n\\n The newspaper boy, a weather-beaten man in his seventies, handed Joseph Colella a paper and Colella gave him a dollar. \"Keep the change.\"\\n\\n That was what Michael Moretti would have said. Joe Colella started to open the paper and Nick Vito\u0027s eye was caught by a photograph on the front page.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"I seen that guy before!\"\\n\\n Tony Santo took a look over Vito\u0027s shoulder. \"Of course you have, shmuck. That\u0027s Adam Warner. He\u0027s runnin\u0027 for President.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Vito insisted. \"I mean I seen him.\" He furrowed his brow, trying to remember. Suddenly it came to him.\\n\\n \"Got it! He was the guy in the bar down in Acapulco with Jennifer Parker.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027re you talkin\u0027 about?\"\\n\\n \"Remember when I was down there last month deliverin\u0027 a package? I saw this guy with Jennifer. They was havin\u0027 a drink together.\"\\n\\n Salvatore Fiore was staring at him. \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Why?\"\\n\\n Fiore said slowly, \"I think maybe you better tell Mike.\"\\n\\n Michael Moretti looked at Nick Vito and said, \"You\u0027re out of your fucking mind. What would Jennifer Parker be doing with Senator Warner?\"\\n\\n \"Beats me, boss. All I know is they was sittin\u0027 in this bar, havin\u0027 a drink.\"\\n\\n \"Just the two of them?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n Salvatore Fiore said, \"I thought you oughtta hear about it, Mike. This Warner asshole is investigatin\u0027 the shit outta us. Why would Jennifer be havin\u0027 a drink with him?\"\\n\\n That was exactly what Michael wanted to know. Jennifer had talked about Acapulco and the convention, and she had mentioned half a dozen people she had run into. But she had not said a word about Adam Warner.\\n\\n He turned to Tony Santo. \"Who\u0027s the business manager of the janitor\u0027s union now?\"\\n\\n \"Charlie Corelli.\"\\n\\n Five minutes later, Michael was speaking to Charles Corelli on the telephone.\\n\\n \"...The Belmont Towers,\" Michael said. \"A friend of mine lived there nine years ago. I\u0027d like to talk to the guy who was the janitor there then.\" Michael listened for a moment. \"I appreciate it, pal. I owe you one.\" He hung up.\\n\\n Nick Vito, Santo, Fiore and Colella were watching him.\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t you bastards got anything to do? Get the fuck out of here.\" The four men hurriedly left.\\n\\n Michael sat there, thinking, picturing Jennifer and Adam Warner together. Why had she never mentioned him? And Joshua\u0027s father, who had died in the Viet Nam war. Why hadn\u0027t Jennifer ever talked about him?\\n\\n Michael Moretti began to pace the office.\\n\\n Three hours later Tony Santo ushered in a timid, badly dressed man in his sixties who was obviously terrified.\\n\\n \"This is Wally Kawolski,\" Tony said.\\n\\n Michael rose and shook Kawolski\u0027s hand. \"Thanks for coming over, Wally. I appreciate it. Sit down. Can I get you anything?\"\\n\\n \"No, no thank you, Mr. Moretti. I\u0027m fine, sir. Thank you very much.\" He was doing everything but bowing.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be nervous. I just want to ask you a couple of questions, Wally.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, Mr. Moretti. Anything you want to know. Anything at all.\"\\n\\n \"Are you still working at the Belmont Towers?\"\\n\\n \"Me? No, sir. I left there, oh, about five years ago. My mother-in-law has bad arthritis and - \"\\n\\n \"Do you remember the tenants?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. Most of \u0027em, I guess. They was kind of - \"\\n\\n \"Do you remember a Jennifer Parker?\"\\n\\n Walter Kawolski\u0027s face lit up. \"Oh, sure. She was a fine lady. I even remember her apartment number. Nineteen twenty-nine. Like the year the market crashed, you know? I liked her.\"\\n\\n \"Did Miss Parker have a lot of visitors, Wally?\"\\n\\n Wally slowly scratched his head. \"Well, that\u0027s hard to say, Mr. Moretti. I only saw her when she was comin\u0027 in or goin\u0027 out, like.\"\\n\\n \"Did any men ever spend the night in her apartment?\"\\n\\n Walter Kawolski shook his head. \"Oh, no, sir.\"\\n\\n So all this had been about nothing. He felt a sharp wave of relief. He had known all along that Jennifer would never -\\n\\n \"Her boyfriend might have come home and caught her.\"\\n\\n Michael thought he must have misunderstood. \"Her boyfriend?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. The guy Miss Parker was livin\u0027 with there.\"\\n\\n The words hit Michael in the stomach like a sledgehammer. He lost control of himself. He grabbed Walter Kawolski by the lapels and jerked him to his feet. \"You stupid cocksucker! I asked you if - what was his name?\"\\n\\n The little man was terrified. \"I don\u0027t know, Mr. Moretti. I swear to God, I don\u0027t know!\"\\n\\n Michael shoved him away. He picked up the newspaper and pushed it under Walter Kawolski\u0027s nose.\\n\\n Kawolski looked at Adam Warner\u0027s photograph and said excitedly, \"That\u0027s him! That\u0027s her boyfriend.\"\\n\\n And Michael felt the world crashing down around him. Jennifer had lied to him all this time; she had betrayed him with Adam Warner! The two of them had been sneaking behind his back, conspiring against him, making a fool of him. She had put horns on him.\\n\\n The ancient juices of vengeance stirred strongly within Michael Moretti, and he knew he was going to kill them both. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-53.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
