There were three candidates vying for the presidential nomination, and each had done well in the primaries. But the star, the one who outshone them all, was Adam Warner. The nomination was his on the fifth ballot, and it was made unanimous. His party finally had a candidate they could put forward with pride. The incumbent President, the leader of the opposition party, had a low credibility rating and was considered by the majority of people to be inept.\\n\\n \"Unless you take your cock out and pee in front of a camera on the six o\u0027clock news,\" Stewart Needham told Adam, \"you\u0027re going to be the next President of the United States.\"\\n\\n After his nomination, Adam flew to New York for a meeting at the Regency Hotel with Needham and several influential members of the party. Present in the room was Blair Roman, head of the second largest advertising agency in the country.\\n\\n Stewart Needham said, \"Blair will be in charge of running the publicity end of your campaign, Adam.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t tell you how glad I am to be aboard.\" Blair Roman grinned. \"You\u0027re going to be my third President.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" Adam was not impressed with the man.\\n\\n \"Let me fill you in on some of the game plan.\" Blair Roman started pacing the room, swinging an imaginary golf club as he walked. \"We\u0027re going to saturate the country with television commercials, build an image of you as the man who can solve America\u0027s problems. Big Daddy - only a young, good-looking Big Daddy. You get it, Mr. President?\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Roman...\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Would you mind not calling me \u0027Mr. President\u0027?\"\\n\\n Blair Roman laughed. \"Sorry. Slip of the tongue, A.W. In my mind you\u0027re already in the White House. Believe me, I know you\u0027re the man for the job or I wouldn\u0027t be undertaking this campaign. I\u0027m too rich to have to work for money.\"\\n\\n Beware of people who say they\u0027re too rich to have to work for money, Adam thought.\\n\\n \"We know you\u0027re the man for the job - now we have to let the people know it. If you\u0027ll just take a look at these charts I\u0027ve prepared, I\u0027ve broken down different sections of the country into various ethnic groups. We\u0027re going to send you to key places where you can press the flesh.\"\\n\\n He leaned forward into Adam\u0027s face and said earnestly, \"Your wife is going to be a big asset. Women\u0027s magazines will go crazy for stuff on your family life. We\u0027re going to merchandise you, A.W.\"\\n\\n Adam found himself beginning to get irritated. \"Just how do you plan to do that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s simple. You\u0027re a product, A.W. We\u0027re going to sell you just like we\u0027d sell any other product. We - \"\\n\\n Adam turned to Stewart Needham. \"Stewart, could I see you alone?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly.\" Needham turned to the others and said, \"Let\u0027s break for dinner and meet back here at nine o\u0027clock. We\u0027ll continue the discussion then.\"\\n\\n When the two men were alone, Adam said, \"Jesus, Stewart! He\u0027s planning to turn this thing into a circus! \u0027You\u0027re a product, A.W. We\u0027re going to sell you just like we\u0027d sell any other product.\u0027 He\u0027s disgusting!\"\\n\\n \"I know how you feel, Adam,\" Stewart Needham said soothingly, \"but Blair gets results. When he said you\u0027re his third President, he wasn\u0027t kidding. Every President since Eisenhower has had an advertising agency masterminding his campaign. Whether you like it or not, a campaign needs salesmanship. Blair Roman knows the psychology of the public. As distasteful as it may be, the reality is that if you want to be elected to any public office, you have to be sold - you have to be merchandised.\"\\n\\n \"I hate it.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s part of the price you\u0027re going to have to pay.\" He walked over to Adam and put an arm across his shoulder. \"All you have to do is keep the objective in mind. You want the White House? All right. We\u0027re going to do everything we can to get you there. But you have to do your part. If being the ringmaster in a three-ring circus is part of it, bear with it.\"\\n\\n \"Do we really need Blair Roman?\"\\n\\n \"We need a Blair Roman. Blair\u0027s as good as there is. Let me handle him. I\u0027ll keep him away from you as much as possible.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d appreciate that.\"\\n\\n The campaign began. It started with a few television spots and personal appearances and gradually grew bigger and bigger until it spanned the nation. Wherever one went, there was Senator Adam Warner in living color. In every part of the country he could be watched on television, heard on radio, seen on billboards. Law and order was one of the key issues of the campaign, and Adam\u0027s crime investigation committee was heavily stressed.\\n\\n Adam taped one-minute television spots, three-minute television spots and five-minute spots, geared for different sections of the country. The television spots that went to West Virginia dealt with unemployment and the vast supply of underground coal that could make the area prosperous; the television segments for Detroit talked about urban blight; in New York City, the subject was the rising crime rate.\\n\\n Blair Roman confided to Adam, \"All you have to do is hit the highlights, A.W. You don\u0027t have to discuss key issues in depth. We\u0027re selling the product, and that\u0027s you.\"\\n\\n Adam said, \"Mr. Roman, I don\u0027t care what your goddamned statistics say. I\u0027m not a breakfast food and I don\u0027t intend to be sold like one. I will talk about issues in depth because I think the American people are intelligent enough to want to know about them.\"\\n\\n \"I only - \"\\n\\n \"I want you to try to set up a debate between me and the President, to discuss the basic issues.\"\\n\\n Blair Roman said, \"Right. I\u0027ll take a meeting with the President\u0027s boys right away, A.W.\"\\n\\n \"One more thing,\" Adam said.\\n\\n \"Yes? What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Stop calling me A.W.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-43.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
