{"id":67866,"no":61,"title":"Page 61","content":"The signalman on the ground, wearing oversized earmuffs, waved his two semaphores, guiding the jumbo 747 toward the waiting ramp. The plane pulled up to a fixed circle and, at a signal, the pilot cut the four Pratt \u0026 Whitney turbofan engines. Inside the giant plane a steward\u0027s voice came over the loudspeaker, \"Ladies and gentlemen, we have just landed at New York\u0027s Kennedy Airport. We thank you for flying TWA. Will all passengers please remain in their seats until a further announcement. Thank you.\" There were general murmurs of protest. A moment later the doors were opened by the ramp crew. The two FBI agents seated with Jennifer in the front of the plane rose to their feet. One of them turned to Jennifer and said, \"Let\u0027s go.\" The passengers watched with curiosity as the three people left the plane. A few minutes later the steward\u0027s voice came over the loudspeaker again. \"Thank you for your patience, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disembark.\" A government limousine was waiting at a side entrance to the airport. The first stop was the Metropolitan Correctional Center at 150 Park Row, that connected into the United States Court House at Foley Square. After Jennifer had been booked, one of the FBI men said, \"Sorry, we can\u0027t keep you here. We have orders to take you out to Riker\u0027s Island.\" The ride to Riker\u0027s Island was made in silence. Jennifer sat in the back seat between the two FBI men, saying nothing, but her mind was busy. The two men had been uncommunicative during the entire trip across the ocean, so Jennifer had no way of knowing how much trouble she was in. She knew that it was serious, for it was not easy to obtain a warrant of extradition. She could do nothing to help herself while she was in jail. Her first priority was to get out on bail. They were crossing the bridge to Riker\u0027s Island now, and Jennifer looked out at the familiar view, a view she had seen a hundred times on the way to talk to clients. And now she was a prisoner. But not for long, Jennifer thought. Michael will get me out. The two FBI men escorted Jennifer into the reception building and one of the men handed the guard the extradition warrant. \"Jennifer Parker.\" The guard glanced at it. \"We\u0027ve been expecting you, Miss Parker. You have a reservation in Detention Cell Three.\" \"I have the right to one phone call.\" The guard nodded toward the telephone on his desk. \"Sure.\" Jennifer picked it up, silently praying that Michael Moretti was in. She began to dial. Michael Moretti had been waiting for Jennifer\u0027s call. For the last twenty-four hours he had been able to think of nothing else. He had been informed when Jennifer had landed in London, when her plane had left Heathrow, and when she had arrived back in New York. He had sat at his desk, mentally tracking Jennifer on her way to Riker\u0027s Island. He had visualized her entering the prison. She would demand to make a phone call before they put her in a cell. She would call him. That was all he asked. He would have her out of there in an hour, and then she would be on her way to him. Michael Moretti was living for the moment when Jennifer Parker walked through the door. Jennifer had done the unforgivable. She had given her body to the man who was trying to destroy him. And what else had she given him? What secrets had she told him? Adam Warner was the father of Jennifer\u0027s son. Michael was certain of that now. Jennifer had lied to him from the beginning, had told him that Joshua\u0027s father was dead. Well, that was a prophecy that will soon be fulfilled, Michael told himself. He was caught in an ironic conflict. On the one hand, he had a powerful weapon he could use to discredit and destroy Adam Warner. He could blackmail Warner with the threat of exposing his relationship with Jennifer; but if he did that, he would be exposing himself. When the Families learned - and they would learn - that Michael\u0027s woman was the mistress of the head of the Senate Investigating Committee, Michael would become a laughingstock. He would no longer be able to hold up his head or command his men. A cuckold was not fit to be a don. So the blackmail threat was a double-edged sword and, as tempting as it was, Michael knew that he dare not use it. He would have to destroy his enemies in another way. Michael looked at the small, crudely drawn map on the desk in front of him. It was Adam Warner\u0027s route to where he was going to attend a private fund-raising dinner party that evening. The map had cost Michael Moretti five thousand dollars. It was going to cost Adam Warner his life. The telephone rang on Michael\u0027s desk and he involuntarily started. He picked it up and heard Jennifer\u0027s voice on the other end. That voice that had whispered endearments into his ear, that had begged him to make love to her, that - \"Michael - are you there?\" \"I\u0027m here. Where are you?\" \"They\u0027ve got me at Riker\u0027s Island. They\u0027re holding me on a murder charge. Bail hasn\u0027t been set yet. When can you - ?\" \"I\u0027ll have you out of there in no time. Just sit tight. Okay?\" \"Yes, Michael.\" He could hear the relief in her voice. \"I\u0027ll have Gino pick you up.\" A few moments later Michael reached for the telephone and dialed a number. He spoke into the phone for several minutes. \"I don\u0027t care how high the bail is. I want her out now.\" He replaced the receiver and pressed a button on his desk. Gino Gallo came in. \"Jennifer Parker\u0027s at Riker\u0027s Island. She should be sprung in an hour or two. Pick her up and bring her here.\" \"Right, boss.\" Michael leaned back in his chair. \"Tell her we won\u0027t have to worry about Adam Warner after today.\" Gino Gallo\u0027s face brightened. \"No?\" \"No. He\u0027s on his way to deliver a speech, but he\u0027ll never get there. He\u0027s going to have an accident at the bridge at New Canaan.\" Gino Gallo smiled. \"That\u0027s great, boss.\" Michael gestured toward the door. \"Move.\" District Attorney Di Silva fought Jennifer\u0027s bail with every stratagem at his command. They were appearing before William Bennett, a judge of the Supreme Court of New York. \"Your Honor,\" Robert Di Silva said, \"the defendant is charged with a dozen counts of felony. We had to extradite her from Singapore. If she\u0027s granted bail, she\u0027ll flee to someplace where there is no extradition. I ask that Your Honor deny bail.\" John Lester, a former judge who was representing Jennifer, said, \"The District Attorney is guilty of gross distortion, Your Honor. My client did not flee anywhere. She was in Singapore on business. If the government had asked her to return she would have done so voluntarily. She\u0027s a reputable attorney with a large practice here. It would be inconceivable that she would run away.\" The arguments went on for more than thirty minutes. At the end of that time, Judge Bennett said, \"Bail is granted in the sum of five hundred thousand dollars.\" \"Thank you, Your Honor,\" Jennifer\u0027s attorney said. \"We\u0027ll pay the bail.\" Fifteen minutes later, Gino Gallo was helping Jennifer into the back of a Mercedes limousine. \"That didn\u0027t take long,\" he said. Jennifer did not reply. Her mind was on what was happening. She had been completely isolated in Singapore. She had no idea of what had been going on in the United States, but she was certain that her arrest was not an unrelated incident. They would not be after her alone. She badly needed to talk to Michael and find out what had been happening. Di Silva had to be very sure of himself to have had her brought back on a murder charge. He - Gino Gallo said two words that caught Jennifer\u0027s attention. \"...Adam Warner...\" Jennifer had not been listening. \"What did you say?\" \"I said we won\u0027t have to worry about Adam Warner no more. Mike is havin\u0027 him took care of.\" Jennifer could feel her heart begin to pound. \"He is? When?\" Gino Gallo raised his hand from the wheel to glance at his watch. \"In about fifteen minutes. It\u0027s set up to look like an accident.\" Jennifer\u0027s mouth was suddenly dry. \"Where - \" She could not get the words out. \"Where - where is it going to happen?\" \"New Canaan. The bridge.\" They were passing through Queens. Ahead was a shopping center with a pharmacy. \"Gino, will you pull up in front of that drugstore? I have to get something.\" \"Sure.\" He skillfully turned the wheel and swung into the entrance to the shopping center. \"Can I help you?\" \"No, no. I\u0027ll - I\u0027ll only be a minute.\" Jennifer got out of the car and hurried inside, nerves screaming. There was a telephone booth at the back of the store. Jennifer reached into her purse. She had no change except for some Singapore coins. She hurried over to the cashier and pulled out a dollar. \"Could I have change, please?\" The bored cashier took Jennifer\u0027s money and gave her a handful of silver. Jennifer dashed back to the telephone. A stout woman was picking up the receiver and dialing. Jennifer said, \"I have an emergency. I wonder if I could - \" The woman glared at her and kept dialing. \"Hello, Hazel,\" the woman whooped. \"My horoscope was right. I\u0027ve had the worst day! You know the shoes I was going to pick up at Delman\u0027s? Would you believe they sold the only pair they had in my size?\" Jennifer touched the woman\u0027s arm and begged, \"Please!\" \"Get your own phone,\" the woman hissed. She turned back to the receiver. \"Remember the suede ones we saw? Gone! So you know what I did? I said to that clerk...\" Jennifer closed her eyes and stood there, oblivious to everything but the torment inside her. Michael must not kill Adam. She had to do whatever she could to save him. The woman hung up and turned to Jennifer. \"I should make another call, just to teach you a lesson,\" she said. As she walked away, smiling at her little victory, Jennifer made a grab for the phone. She called Adam\u0027s office. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" his secretary said, \"but Senator Warner is not in. Do you wish to leave a message?\" \"It\u0027s urgent,\" Jennifer said. \"Do you know where he can be reached?\" \"No, I\u0027m sorry. If you would like to - \" Jennifer hung up. She stood there a moment, thinking, then quickly dialed another number. \"Robert Di Silva.\" There was an interminable wait and then: \"The District Attorney\u0027s office.\" \"I have to speak to Mr. Di Silva. This is Jennifer Parker.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. Mr. Di Silva is in a conference. He can\u0027t be dis - \" \"You get him on this telephone. This is an emergency. Hurry!\" Jennifer\u0027s voice was trembling. Di Silva\u0027s secretary hesitated. \"Just a moment.\" A minute later, Robert Di Silva was on the telephone. \"Yes?\" His voice was unfriendly. \"Listen, and listen carefully,\" Jennifer said. \"Adam Warner\u0027s going to be killed. It\u0027s going to happen in the next ten or fifteen minutes. They\u0027re planning to do it at the New Canaan bridge.\" She hung up. There was nothing more she could do. A brief vision of Adam\u0027s torn body came into her mind and she shuddered. She looked at her watch and silently prayed that Di Silva would be able to get help there in time. Robert Di Silva replaced the receiver and looked at the halfdozen men in his office. \"That was a weird call.\" \"Who was it?\" \"Jennifer Parker. She said they\u0027re going to assassinate Senator Warner.\" \"Why did she call you?\" \"Who knows?\" \"Do you think it\u0027s on the level?\" District Attorney Di Silva said, \"Hell, no.\" Jennifer walked through the office door and, in spite of himself, Michael could not help reacting to her beauty. It was the same way he felt every time he saw her. Outside, she was the loveliest woman he had ever seen. But inside she was treacherous, deadly. He looked at the lips that had kissed Adam Warner and at the body that had lain in Adam Warner\u0027s arms. She was walking in saying, \"Michael, I\u0027m so glad to see you. Thank you for arranging everything so quickly.\" \"No problem. I\u0027ve been waiting for you, Jennifer.\" She would never know how much he meant that. She sank into an armchair. \"Michael, what in God\u0027s name is going on? What\u0027s happening?\" He studied her, half admiring her. She was responsible for helping to bring his empire crashing down, and she was sitting there innocently asking what was going on! \"Do you know why they brought me back?\" Sure, he thought. So you can sing some more for them. He remembered the little yellow canary with its broken neck. That would be Jennifer soon. Jennifer looked into his black eyes. \"Are you all right?\" \"I\u0027ve never been better.\" He leaned back in his chair. \"In a few minutes, all our problems are going to be over.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Senator Warner is going to have an accident. That\u0027ll cool off the committee pretty good.\" He looked at the clock on the wall. \"I should be getting a phone call any minute.\" There was something odd in Michael\u0027s manner, something forbidding. Jennifer was filled with a sudden premonition of danger. She knew she had to get out of there. She stood up. \"I haven\u0027t had a chance to unpack. I\u0027ll go - \" \"Sit down.\" The undertone in Michael\u0027s voice sent a chill down her back. \"Michael - \" \"Sit down.\" She glanced toward the door. Gino Gallo was standing there, his back against it, watching Jennifer with no expression on his face. \"You\u0027re not going anywhere,\" Michael told her. \"I don\u0027t under - \" \"Don\u0027t talk. Don\u0027t say another word.\" They sat there waiting, staring at each other, and the only sound in the room was the loud ticking of the clock on the wall. Jennifer tried to read Michael\u0027s eyes, but they were blank, filled with nothing, giving away nothing. The sudden ringing of the telephone jarred the stillness of the room. Michael picked up the receiver. \"Hello?...Are you sure?...All right. Get out of there.\" He replaced the receiver and looked up at Jennifer. \"The bridge at New Canaan is swarming with cops.\" Jennifer could feel the relief flooding through her body. It became a sense of exhilaration. Michael was watching her and she made an effort not to let her emotions show. Jennifer asked, \"What does that mean?\" Michael said slowly, \"Nothing. Because that\u0027s not where Adam Warner is going to die.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-61.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
