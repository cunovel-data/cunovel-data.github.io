{"id":67847,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"Antonio Granelli died and Michael took over full control of his empire. The funeral was lavish, as befitted a man of the Godfather\u0027s stature. The heads and members of Families from all over the country came to pay their respects to their departed friend, and to assure the new capo of their loyalty and support. The FBI was there, taking photographs, as well as half a dozen other government agencies.\n Rosa was heartbroken, because she had loved her father very much, but she took consolation and pride in the fact that her husband was taking her father\u0027s place as head of the Family.\n Jennifer was proving more valuable to Michael every day. When there was a problem, it was Jennifer whom Michael consulted. Thomas Colfax was becoming an increasingly bothersome appendage.\n \"Don\u0027t worry about him,\" Michael told Jennifer. \"He\u0027s going to retire soon.\"\n The soft chimes of the telephone awakened Jennifer. She lay in bed, listening a moment, then sat up and looked at the digital clock on the nightstand. It was three o\u0027clock in the morning.\n She lifted the receiver. \"Hello.\"\n It was Michael. \"Can you get dressed right away?\"\n Jennifer sat up straighter and tried to blink the sleep from her eyes. \"What\u0027s happened?\"\n \"Eddie Santini was just picked up on an armed robbery charge. He\u0027s a two-time loser. If they convict him, they\u0027ll throw the key away.\"\n \"Were there any witnesses?\"\n \"Three, and they all got a good look at him.\"\n \"Where is he now?\"\n \"The Seventeenth Precinct.\"\n \"I\u0027m on my way, Michael.\"\n Jennifer put on a robe and went down to the kitchen and made herself a steaming pot of coffee. She sat drinking it in the breakfast room, staring out at the night, thinking. Three witnesses. And they all got a good look at him.\n She picked up the telephone and dialed. \"Give me the City Desk.\"\n Jennifer spoke rapidly. \"I got some information for you. A guy named Eddie Santini\u0027s just been picked up on an armed robbery charge. His attorney\u0027s Jennifer Parker. She\u0027s gonna try to spring him.\"\n She hung up and repeated the call to two other newspapers and a television station. When Jennifer was through telephoning, she looked at her watch and had another leisurely cup of coffee. She wanted to make certain the photographers had time to get to the precinct on 51st Street. She went upstairs and got dressed.\n Before Jennifer left, she went into Joshua\u0027s bedroom. His night-light was on. He was sound asleep, the blankets twisted around his restless body. Jennifer gently straightened the blankets, kissed him on the forehead and started to tiptoe out of the room.\n \"Where you goin\u0027?\"\n She turned and said, \"I\u0027m going to work. Go back to sleep.\"\n \"What time is it?\"\n \"It\u0027s four o\u0027clock in the morning.\"\n Joshua giggled. \"You sure work funny hours for a lady.\"\n She came back to his bedside. \"And you sure sleep funny hours for a man.\"\n \"Are we going to watch the Mets game tonight?\"\n \"You bet we are. Back to Dreamland.\"\n \"Okay, Mom. Have a good case.\"\n \"Thanks, pal.\"\n A few minutes later, Jennifer was in her car, on her way into Manhattan.\n When Jennifer arrived, a lone photographer from the Daily News was waiting. He stared at Jennifer and said, \"It\u0027s true! You really handling the Santini case?\"\n \"How did you know that?\" Jennifer demanded.\n \"A little birdie, counselor.\"\n \"You\u0027re wasting your time. No pictures.\"\n She went inside and arranged for Eddie Santini\u0027s bail, stalling the proceedings until she was sure the television cameraman and a reporter and photographer had arrived from The New York Times. She decided she could not wait for the Post.\n The police captain on duty said, \"There\u0027re some reporters and television people out front, Miss Parker. You can go out the back way if you want.\"\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" Jennifer said. \"I\u0027ll handle them.\"\n She led Eddie Santini to the front corridor where the photographers and reporters were waiting.\n She said, \"Look, gentlemen, no pictures, please.\"\n And Jennifer stepped aside while the photographer and television cameraman took pictures.\n A reporter asked, \"What makes this case big enough for you to handle?\"\n \"You\u0027ll find out tomorrow. Meanwhile, I would advise you not to use those pictures.\"\n One of the reporters called out, \"Come on, Jennifer! Haven\u0027t you heard of freedom of the press?\"\n At noon Jennifer got a call from Michael Moretti. His voice was angry. \"Have you seen the newspapers?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Well, Eddie Santini\u0027s picture is all over the front pages and on the television news. I didn\u0027t tell you to turn this goddamned thing into a circus!\"\n \"I know you didn\u0027t. It was my own idea.\"\n \"Jesus! What\u0027s the point?\"\n \"The point, Michael, is those three witnesses.\"\n \"What about them?\"\n \"You said they got a good look at Eddie Santini. Well, when they get up in court to identify him, they\u0027re going to have to prove they didn\u0027t identify him because they saw his picture all over the newspapers and television.\"\n There was a long silence, and then Michael\u0027s voice said admiringly, \"I\u0027m a son of a bitch!\"\n Jennifer had to laugh.\n Ken Bailey was waiting in her office that afternoon when Jennifer walked in, and she knew instantly from the look on his face that something was wrong.\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" Ken demanded.\n \"Tell you what?\"\n \"About you and Mike Moretti.\"\n Jennifer checked the retort that rose to her lips. Saying It\u0027s none of your business was too easy. Ken was her friend; he cared. In a way, it was his business. Jennifer remembered it all, the tiny office they had shared, how he had helped her. I\u0027ve got a lawyer friend who\u0027s been bugging me to serve some subpoenas for him. I haven\u0027t got time. He pays twelve-fifty for each subpoena plus mileage. Would you help me out?\n \"Ken, let\u0027s not discuss this.\"\n His tone was filled with cold fury. \"Why not? Everybody else is discussing it. The word is that you\u0027re Moretti\u0027s girl.\" His face was pale. \"Jesus!\"\n \"My personal life - \"\n \"He lives in a sewer and you brought that sewer into the office! You\u0027ve got us all working for Moretti and his hoodlums.\"\n \"Stop it!\"\n \"I am. That\u0027s what I came to tell you. I\u0027m leaving.\"\n His words were a shock. \"You can\u0027t leave. You\u0027re wrong about what you think of Michael. If you\u0027ll just meet him, you\u0027ll see - \"\n The moment the words were out, Jennifer knew she had made a mistake.\n He looked at her sadly and said, \"He\u0027s really wrapped you up, hasn\u0027t he? I remember you when you knew who you were. That\u0027s the girl I want to remember. Say good-bye to Joshua for me.\"\n And Ken Bailey was gone.\n Jennifer felt the tears begin to come, and her throat constricted so tightly that she could hardly breathe. She put her head down on the desk and closed her eyes, trying to shut out the hurt.\n When she opened her eyes, night had fallen. The office was in darkness except for the eerie red glow cast by the city lights. She walked over to the window and stared out at the city below. It looked like a jungle at night, with only a dying campfire to keep away the encroaching terrors.\n It was Michael\u0027s jungle. There was no way out of it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-42.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: \n A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
