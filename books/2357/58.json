{"id":67863,"no":58,"title":"Page 58","content":"Nick Vito was a man of limited intelligence. His value to the Organization lay in the fact that he followed orders without question and that he carried them out efficiently. Nick Vito had been up against guns and knives dozens of times, but he had never known fear. He knew it now. Something was happening that was beyond his understanding, and he had a feeling that somehow he was responsible for it.\\n\\n All day he had been hearing about the raids that were taking place, the sweeping arrests that were being made. The street talk was that there was a traitor loose, someone high up in the Organization. Even with his limited intellect, Nick Vito was able to connect the fact that he had let Thomas Colfax live and that, shortly afterward, someone had started betraying the Family to the authorities. Nick Vito knew that it could not be Salvatore Fiore or Joseph Colella. The two men were like brothers to him and they were both as fanatically loyal to Michael Moretti as he was. But there was no way he could ever explain that to Michael, not without getting himself chopped into small pieces; because the only other one who could be responsible was Thomas Colfax, and Colfax was supposed to be dead.\\n\\n Nick Vito was in a dilemma. He loved the Little Flower and the giant. Fiore and Colella had done him dozens of favors in the past, just as Thomas Colfax had; but he had helped Colfax out of a jam, and look what it had gotten him. So Nick Vito decided he was not going to be softhearted again. It was his own life he had to protect now. Once he killed Fiore and Colella, he would be in the clear. But because they were like brothers to him, he would see that they died quickly.\\n\\n It was simple for Nick Vito to determine their whereabouts, for they always had to be available in case Michael needed them. Little Salvatore Fiore was visiting his mistress\u0027s apartment on 83rd Street near the Museum of Natural History. Nick knew that Salvatore always left there at five o\u0027clock to go home to his wife. It was now three. Nick debated with himself. He could either hang around the front of the apartment building or go upstairs and take Salvatore inside the apartment. He decided he was too nervous to wait. The fact that he was nervous made Nick Vito more nervous. The whole thing was beginning to get to him. When this is over, he thought, I\u0027m gonna ask Mike for a vacation. Maybe I\u0027ll take a couple of young girls and go down to the Bahamas. Just thinking about that made him feel better.\\n\\n Nick Vito parked his car around the corner from the apartment house and walked up to the building. He let himself in the front door with a piece of celluloid, ignored the elevator and walked up the stairs to the third floor. He moved toward the door at the end of the corridor, and when he reached it he pounded on it.\\n\\n \"Open up! Police!\"\\n\\n He heard quick sounds from behind the door and a few moments later it opened on a heavy chain and he could see the face and part of the naked figure of Marina, Salvatore Fiore\u0027s mistress.\\n\\n \"Nick!\" she said. \"You crazy idiot. You scared the hell out of me.\"\\n\\n She took the chain off the door and opened it. \"Sal, it\u0027s Nick!\"\\n\\n Little Salvatore Fiore walked in from the bedroom, naked. \"Hey, Nicky boy! What the fuck you doin\u0027 here?\"\\n\\n \"Sal, I got a message for you from Mike.\"\\n\\n Nick Vito raised a .22 automatic with a silencer and squeezed the trigger. The firing pin slammed into the .22 caliber cartridge, sending the bullet out of the muzzle at a thousand feet a second. The first bullet shattered the bridge of Salvatore Fiore\u0027s nose. The second bullet put out his left eye. As Marina opened her mouth to scream, Nick Vito turned and put a bullet in her head. As she fell to the floor, he put one more bullet in her chest, to make certain. It\u0027s a waste of a beautiful piece of ass, Nick thought, but Mike wouldn\u0027t like it if I left any witnesses around.\\n\\n Big Joseph Colella owned a horse that was running in the eighth race at Belmont Park in Long Island. Belmont was a one-and-one-half-mile track, the perfect length for the filly that the giant was running. He had advised Nick to bet on it. In the past, Nick had won a lot on Colella\u0027s tips. Colella always put a little money on for Nick when his horses ran. As Nick Vito walked toward Colella\u0027s box, he thought regretfully about the fact that there would be no more tips. The eighth race had just started. Colella was standing up in his box, cheering his horse on. It was a large-purse race and the crowd was screaming and yelling as the horses rounded the first turn.\\n\\n Nick Vito stepped into the box behind Colella and said, \"How you doin\u0027, pal?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Nick! You got here just in time. Beauty Queen\u0027s gonna win this one. I put a little bet on it for you.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great, Joe.\"\\n\\n Nick Vito pressed the .22 caliber gun against Joseph Colella\u0027s spine and fired three times through his coat. The muffled noise went unnoticed in the cheering crowd. Nick watched Joseph Colella slump to the ground. He debated for an instant whether to take the pari-mutuel tickets out of Colella\u0027s pocket, then decided against it. After all, the horse could lose.\\n\\n Nick Vito turned and unhurriedly walked toward the exit, one anonymous figure among thousands.\\n\\n Michael Moretti\u0027s private line rang.\\n\\n \"Mr. Moretti?\"\\n\\n \"Who wants him?\"\\n\\n \"This is Captain Tanner.\"\\n\\n It took Michael a second to place the name. A police captain. Queens precinct. On the payroll.\\n\\n \"This is Moretti.\"\\n\\n \"I just received some information I think might interest you.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you calling from?\"\\n\\n \"A public telephone booth.\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead.\"\\n\\n \"I found out where all the heat\u0027s coming from.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re too late. They\u0027ve been taken care of already.\"\\n\\n \"They? Oh. I only heard about Thomas Colfax.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know what the hell you\u0027re talking about. Colfax is dead.\"\\n\\n It was Captain Tanner\u0027s turn to be confused. \"What are you talking about? Thomas Colfax is sitting at the Marine Base in Quantico right now, spilling his guts to everybody who\u0027ll listen.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re out of your mind,\" Michael snapped. \"I happen to know - \" He stopped. What did he know? He had told Nick Vito to kill Thomas Colfax, and Vito had said that he had. Michael sat there thinking. \"How sure are you about this, Tanner?\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Moretti, would I be calling you if I wasn\u0027t sure?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll check it out. If you\u0027re right, I owe you one.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Mr. Moretti.\"\\n\\n Captain Tanner replaced the receiver, pleased with himself. In the past he had found Michael Moretti to be a very appreciative man. This could be the big one, the one that could enable him to retire. He stepped out of the telephone booth into the cold October air.\\n\\n There were two men standing outside the booth, and as the captain started to step around them, one of them blocked his way. He held up an identification card.\\n\\n \"Captain Tanner? I\u0027m Lieutenant West, Internal Security Division. The Police Commissioner would like to have a word with you.\"\\n\\n Michael Moretti hung up the receiver slowly. He knew with a sure animal instinct that Nick Vito had lied to him. Thomas Colfax was still alive. That would explain everything that was happening. He was the one who had turned traitor. And Michael had sent Nick Vito out to kill Fiore and Colella. Jesus, he had been stupid! Outsmarted by a dumb hired gunman into wasting his two top men! He was filled with an icy rage.\\n\\n He dialed a number and spoke briefly into the telephone. After he made a second telephone call, he sat back and waited.\\n\\n When he heard Nick Vito on the phone, Michael forced himself to keep the fury he felt out of his voice. \"How did it go, Nick?\"\\n\\n \"Okay, boss. Just like you said. They both suffered a lot.\"\\n\\n \"I can always count on you, Nick, can\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"You know you can, boss.\"\\n\\n \"Nick, I want you to do me one last favor. One of the boys left a car at the corner of York and Ninety-fifth Street. It\u0027s a tan Camaro. The keys are behind the sun visor. We\u0027re going to use it for a job tonight. Drive it over here, will you?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, boss. How soon do you need it? I was going to - \"\\n\\n \"I need it now. Right away, Nick.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on my way.\"\\n\\n \"Good-bye, Nick.\"\\n\\n Michael replaced the receiver. He wished he could be there to watch Nick Vito blow himself to hell, but he had one more urgent thing to do.\\n\\n Jennifer Parker would be on her way back soon, and he wanted to get everything ready for her. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-58.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
