{"id":67868,"no":63,"title":"Page 63","content":"Two interns were wheeling Jennifer out of the operating room and into Intensive Care. A uniformed policeman followed at Jennifer\u0027s side. The hospital corridor was a bedlam of policemen, detectives and reporters.\n A man walked up to the reception desk and said, \"I want to see Jennifer Parker.\"\n \"Are you a member of her family?\"\n \"No. I\u0027m a friend.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry. No visitors. She\u0027s in Intensive Care.\"\n \"I\u0027ll wait.\"\n \"It could be a long time.\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t matter,\" Ken Bailey said.\n A side door opened and Adam Warner, gaunt and haggard, entered, flanked by a team of secret service men.\n A doctor was waiting to greet him. \"This way, Senator Warner.\" He led Adam into a small office.\n \"How is she?\" Adam asked.\n \"I\u0027m not optimistic. We removed three bullets from her.\"\n The door opened and District Attorney Robert Di Silva hurried in. He looked at Adam Warner and said, \"I\u0027m sure glad you\u0027re okay.\"\n Adam said, \"I understand I owe my thanks to you. How did you know?\"\n \"Jennifer Parker called me. She told me they were setting you up in New Canaan. I figured it was probably some kind of diversionary ploy, but I couldn\u0027t take a chance, so I covered it. Meanwhile, I got hold of the route you were taking and we sent some choppers after you to protect you. My hunch is that Parker tried to set you up.\"\n \"No,\" Adam said. \"No.\"\n Robert Di Silva shrugged. \"Have it your way, Senator. The important thing is that you\u0027re alive.\" As an afterthought he turned to the doctor. \"Is she going to live?\"\n \"Her chances are not very good.\"\n The District Attorney saw the look on Adam Warner\u0027s face and misinterpreted it. \"Don\u0027t worry. If she makes it, we\u0027ve got her nailed down tight.\"\n He looked at Adam more closely. \"You look like hell. Why don\u0027t you go home and get some rest?\"\n \"I want to see Jennifer Parker first.\"\n The doctor said, \"She\u0027s in a coma. She may not come out of it.\"\n \"I would like to see her, please.\"\n \"Of course, Senator. This way.\"\n The doctor led the way out of the room, with Adam following and Di Silva behind him. They walked a few feet down the corridor to a sign that said INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - KEEP OUT.\n The doctor opened the door and held it for the two men. \"She\u0027s in the first room.\"\n There was a policeman in front of the door, guarding it. He came to attention as he saw the District Attorney.\n \"No one gets near that room without written authorization from me. You understand?\" Di Silva asked.\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n Adam and Di Silva walked into the room. There were three beds, two of them empty. Jennifer lay in the third, tubes running into her nostrils and wrists. Adam moved close to the bed and stared down at her. Jennifer\u0027s face was very pale against the white pillows, and her eyes were closed. In repose, her face seemed younger and softer. Adam was looking at the innocent girl he had met years ago, the girl who had said angrily to him, If anyone had paid me off, do you think I\u0027d be living in a place like this? I don\u0027t care what you do. All I want is to be left alone. He remembered her courage and idealism and her vulnerability. She had been on the side of the angels, believing in justice and willing to fight for it. What had gone wrong? He had loved her and he loved her still, and he had made one wrong choice that had poisoned all their lives, and he knew he would never feel free of guilt for as long as he lived.\n He turned to the doctor. \"Let me know when she - \" He could not say the words. \" - what happens.\"\n \"Of course,\" the doctor said.\n Adam Warner took one long last look at Jennifer and said a silent good-bye. Then he turned and walked out to face the waiting reporters.\n Through a dim, misty haze of semiconsciousness, Jennifer heard the men leave. She had not understood what they were saying, for their words were blurred by the pain that gripped her. She thought she had heard Adam\u0027s voice, but she knew that could not be. He was dead. She tried to open her eyes, but the effort was too great.\n Jennifer\u0027s thoughts began to drift...Abraham Wilson came running into the room carrying a box. He stumbled and the box opened and a yellow canary flew out of it...Robert Di Silva was screaming, Catch it! Don\u0027t let it get away!...and Michael Moretti was holding it and laughing, and Father Ryan said, Look, everybody! It\u0027s a miracle! and Connie Garrett was dancing around the room and everyone applauded...Mrs. Cooper said, I\u0027m going to give you Wyoming...Wyoming...Wyoming...and Adam came in with dozens of red roses and Michael said, They\u0027re from me, and Jennifer said, I\u0027ll put them in a vase in water, and they shriveled and died and the water spilled onto the floor and became a lake, and she and Adam were sailing, and Michael was chasing them on water skis and he became Joshua and he smiled at Jennifer and waved and started to lose his balance, and she screamed, Don\u0027t fall...Don\u0027t fall...Don\u0027t fall...and an enormous wave swept Joshua into the air and he held out his arms like Jesus and disappeared.\n For an instant, Jennifer\u0027s mind cleared.\n Joshua was gone.\n Adam was gone.\n Michael was gone.\n She was alone. In the end, everyone was alone. Each person had to die his own death. It would be easy to die now.\n A feeling of blessed peace began to steal over her. Soon there was no more pain. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-63.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: \n A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
