{"id":76663,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"His name was Joshua Adam Parker and he weighed in at eight pounds, six ounces, a perfectly formed baby. Jennifer knew that babies were supposed to be ugly at birth, wrinkled and red and resembling little apes. Not Joshua Adam. He was beautiful. The nurses at the hospital kept telling Jennifer what a handsome boy Joshua was, and Jennifer could not hear it often enough. The resemblance to Adam was striking. Joshua Adam had his father\u0027s gray-blue eyes and beautifully shaped head. When Jennifer looked at him, she was looking at Adam. It was a strange feeling, a poignant mixture of joy and sadness. How Adam would have loved to see his handsome son!\n When Joshua was two days old he smiled up at Jennifer and she excitedly rang for the nurse.\n \"Look! He\u0027s smiling!\"\n \"It\u0027s gas, Mrs. Parker.\"\n \"With other babies it might be gas,\" Jennifer said stubbornly. \"My son is smiling.\"\n Jennifer had wondered how she would feel about her baby, had worried whether she would be a good mother. Babies were surely boring to be around. They messed their diapers, demanded to be fed constantly, cried and slept. There was no communication with them.\n I won\u0027t really feel anything about him until he\u0027s four or five years old, Jennifer had thought. How wrong, how wrong. From the moment of Joshua\u0027s birth, Jennifer loved her son with a love she had never known existed in her. It was a fiercely protective love. Joshua was so small, and the world so large.\n When Jennifer brought Joshua home from the hospital, she was given a long list of instructions, but they only served to panic her. For the first two weeks a practical nurse stayed at the house. After that, Jennifer was on her own, and she was terrified she might do something wrong that would kill the baby. She was afraid he might stop breathing at any moment.\n The first time Jennifer made Joshua\u0027s formula, she realized she had forgotten to sterilize the nipple. She threw the formula in the sink and started all over again. When she had finished she remembered she had forgotten to sterilize the bottle. She began again. By the time Joshua\u0027s meal was ready, he was screaming with rage.\n There were times when Jennifer did not think she would be able to cope. At unexpected moments she was overwhelmed with feelings of unexplained depression. She told herself that it was the normal postpartum blues, but the explanation did not make her feel any better. She was constantly exhausted. It seemed to her that she was up all night giving Joshua his feedings and when she did finally manage to drop off to sleep, Joshua\u0027s cries would awaken her and Jennifer would stumble back into the nursery.\n She called the doctor constantly, at all hours of the day and night\n \"Joshua\u0027s breathing too fast\"...\"He\u0027s breathing too slowly\"...\"Joshua\u0027s coughing\"...\"He didn\u0027t eat his dinner\"...\"Joshua vomited.\"\n In self-defense, the doctor finally drove to the house and gave Jennifer a lecture.\n \"Mrs. Parker, I\u0027ve never seen a healthier baby than your son. He may look fragile, but he\u0027s as strong as an ox. Stop worrying about him and enjoy him. Just remember one thing - he\u0027s going to outlive both of us!\"\n And so Jennifer began to relax. She had decorated Joshua\u0027s bedroom with print curtains and a bedspread with a blue background sprigged with white flowers and yellow butter-flies. There was a crib, a play pen, a miniature matching chest and desk and chair, a rocking horse, and the chest full of toys.\n Jennifer loved holding Joshua, bathing and diapering him, taking him for airings in his shiny new perambulator. She talked to him constantly, and when Joshua was four weeks old he rewarded her with a smile. Not gas, Jennifer thought happily. A smile!\n The first time Ken Bailey saw the baby, he stared at it for a long time. With a feeling of sudden panic, Jennifer thought, He\u0027s going to recognize it. He\u0027s going to know it\u0027s Adam\u0027s baby.\n But all Ken said was, \"He\u0027s a real beauty. He takes after his mother.\"\n She let Ken hold Joshua in his arms and she laughed at Ken\u0027s awkwardness. But she could not help thinking, Joshua will never have a father to hold him.\n Six weeks had passed and it was time to go back to work. Jennifer hated the idea of being away from her son, even for a few hours a day, but the thought of returning to the office filled her with excitement. She had completely cut herself off from everything for so long. It was time to re-enter her other world.\n She looked in the mirror and decided the first thing she had to do was get her body back in shape. She had been dieting and exercising since shortly after Joshua\u0027s birth, but now she went at it even more strenuously, and soon she began to look like her old self.\n Jennifer started to interview housekeepers. She examined them as though each one was a juror: she probed, looking for weaknesses, lies, incompetence. She interviewed more than twenty potential candidates before she found one she liked and trusted, a middle-aged Scotswoman named Mrs. Mackey, who had worked for one family for fifteen years and had left when the children had grown up and gone away to school.\n Jennifer had Ken check her out, and when Ken assured her that Mrs. Mackey was legitimate, Jennifer hired her.\n A week later Jennifer returned to the office. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-29.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: \n A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
