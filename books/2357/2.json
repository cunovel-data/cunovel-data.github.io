{"id":67812,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"As Jennifer was making her way out of the Criminal Courts Building on her way to lunch, she passed the open door of a deserted courtroom. She could not resist stepping inside the room for a moment.\\n\\n There were fifteen rows of spectators\u0027 benches on each side of the rear area. Facing the judge\u0027s bench were two long tables, the one on the left marked Plaintiff and the one on the right marked Defendant.\\n\\n The jury box contained two rows of eight chairs each. It\u0027s an ordinary courtroom, Jennifer thought, plain - even ugly - but it\u0027s the heart of freedom.\\n\\n This room and all the courtrooms like it represented the difference between civilization and savagery. The right to a trial by a jury of one\u0027s peers was what lay at the heart of every free nation.\\n\\n Jennifer thought of all the countries in the world that did not have this little room, countries where citizens were taken from their beds in the middle of the night and tortured and murdered by anonymous enemies for undisclosed reasons: Iran, Uganda, Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Romania, Russia, Czechoslovakia .. the list was depressingly long.\\n\\n If the American courts were ever stripped of their power, Jennifer thought, if ciitzens were ever denied the right to a trial by jury, then America would cease to exist as a free nation. She was a part of the system now and , standing there, Jennifer was filled with an overwhelming feeling of pride.\\n\\n She would do everything she could to honor it, to help preserve it. She stood there for a long moment, then turned to leave.\\n\\n From the far end of the hall there was a distant hum that got louder and louder, and became pandemonium.\\n\\n Alarm bells began to ring. Jennifer heard the sound of running feet in the corridor and saw policemen with drawn guns racing toward the entrance of the courhouse. Jennifer\u0027s instant thought was that Michael Moretti had escaped, had somehow gotten past the barrier of guards.\\n\\n She hurried out into the corridor. It was bedlam. People were racing around frantically, shouting orders over the din of the clanging bells. Guards armed with riot guns had taken up positions at the exit doors.\\n\\n Reporters who had been telephoning in their stories were hurrying into the corridor to find out what was happening. Far down the hall, Jennifer saw District Attorney Robert Di Silva wildly issuing instructions to half a dozen policemen, his face drained of color.\\n\\n My God! He\u0027s going to have a heart attack, Jennifer thought.\\n\\n She pushed her way through the crowd and moved toward him, thinking that perhaps she could be of some use. As she approached, one of the deputies who had been guarding Camillo Stla looked up and saw Jennifer. He raised an arm and pointed to her, and five seconds later Jennifer Parker found herself being grabbed, handcuffed and placed under arrest.\\n\\n There were four people in Judge Lawrence Waldman\u0027s chambers: Judge Waldman, District attorney Robert Di Silva, Thomas Colfax, and Jennifer.\\n\\n \u0027You have the right to have an attorney present before you make any statement,\u0027 Judge Waldman informed Jennifer, \u0027 and you have the right to remain silent. If you -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t need an attorney, Your Honor! I can explain what happened.\u0027\\n\\n Robert Di Silva was leaning so close to her that Jennifer could see the throbbing of a vein in his temple. \u0027Who paid you to give that package to Camillo Stela?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Paid me?Nobody paid me!\u0027 Jennifer\u0027s voice was quavering with indignation.\\n\\n Di Silva picked up a familiar looking manila envelope from Judge Waldman\u0027s desk.\u0027No one paid you? You just walked up to my witness and delivered this?\u0027 He shook the envelope and the body of a yellow canary fluttered to the desk. Its neck had been broken.\\n\\n Jennifer stared at it, horrified. \u0027I - one of your men - gvae me -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whick one of my men?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I - I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you know he was one of my men.\u0027 His voice rang with disbelief.\\n\\n \u0027Yes. I saw him talking to you and then he walked over to me and handed me the envelope and said you wanted me to give it to Mr Stela. He - he even knew my name.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll bet he did. How much did they pay you?\u0027\\n\\n It\u0027s all a nightmare, Jennifer thought. I\u0027m going to wake up any minute and it\u0027s going to be six o\u0027clock in the morning, and I\u0027m going to get dressed and go to be sworn in on the District Attorney\u0027s staff.\\n\\n \u0027How much?\u0027 The anger in him was so violent that it forced Jennifer to her feet.\\n\\n \u0027Are you accusing me of -?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Accusing you!\u0027 Robert Di Silva clenched his fists. \u0027 Lady, I haven\u0027t even started on you. By the time you get out of prison you\u0027ll be too old to spend that money.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is no money.\u0027 Jennifer stared at him defiantly.\\n\\n Thomas Colfax had been sitting back, quietly listening to the conversation.\\n\\n He interrupted now to say, \u0027 Excuse me, Your Honor, but I\u0027m afraid this isn\u0027t getting us anywhere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I agree,\u0027 Judge Waldman replied. He turned to the District Attorney. \u0027 Where do you stand, Bobby? Is Stela still willing to be cross-examined?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cross-examined? He\u0027s a basket case! Scared out of his wits. He won\u0027t take the stand again.\u0027\\n\\n Thomas Colfax said smoothly, \u0027 If I can\u0027t cross-examine the prosecution\u0027s chief witness, Your Honor, I\u0027m going to have to move for a mistrial.\u0027\\n\\n Everyone in the room knew what that would mean: Michael Moretti would walk out of the courtroom a free man.\\n\\n Judge Waldman looked over at the District Attorney. \u0027 Did you tell your witness he can be held in contempt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Stela\u0027s more scared of them than he is of us.\u0027 He turned to direct a venomous look at Jennifer. \u0027 He doesn\u0027t think we can protect him anyymore.\u0027\\n\\n Judge Waldman said slowly, \u0027 Then I\u0027m afraid this court has no alternative but to grant the defense\u0027s request and declare a mistrial.\u0027\\n\\n Robert Di Silva stood there, listening to his case being wiped out. Without Stela, he had no case. Michael Moretti was beyod his reach now, but Jennifer Parker was not. He was going to make her pay for what she had done to him.\\n\\n Judge Waldman was saying, \u0027 I\u0027ll give instructions for the defendant to be freed and the jury dismissed.\u0027\\n\\n Thomas Colfax said, \u0027 Thank you , Your Honor.\u0027 There was no sign of triumph in his face.\\n\\n \u0027If there\u0027s nothing else...\u0027 Judge Waldman began.\\n\\n \u0027There is something else!\u0027 Robert Di Silva turned to Jennifer Parker. \u0027 I want her held for obstructing justice, for tempering with a witness in a capital case, for conspiracy, for ...\u0027 He was incoherent with rage.\\n\\n In her anger, Jennifer found her voice. \u0027 You can\u0027t prove a signle one of those charges because they\u0027re not true. I - I may be guilty of being stupid, but that\u0027s all I\u0027m guilty of. No one bribed me to do anything. I thought I was delivering a package for you.\u0027\\n\\n Judge Waldman looked at Jennifer and said, \u0027 Whatever the motivation, the consequences have been exetremely unfortunate. I am going to request that the Appellate Division undertake an investigation and , if it feels the circumstances warrant it, to begin disbarment proceedings against you.\u0027\\n\\n Jennifer felt suddenly faint. \u0027 Your Honor, I -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That is all for now, Miss Parker.\u0027\\n\\n Jennifer stood there a moment, staring at their hostile faces. There was nothing more she could say.\\n\\n The yellow canary on the desk had said it all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-2.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
