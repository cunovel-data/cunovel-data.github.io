The other passengers were detained in their seats until Jennifer and the two FBI agents were out of the plane and in the airport\u0027s security office.\\n\\n Jennifer was desperately anxious to see a newspaper to find out what was happening at home, but her two silent escorts denied her request and refused to be drawn into conversation.\\n\\n Two hours later, the three of them boarded a TWA plane bound for New York.\\n\\n In the United States Court House at Foley Square an emergency meeting was taking place. Present were Adam Warner, Robert Di Silva, Major General Roy Wallace, and half a dozen representatives from the FBI, the Justice Department and the Treasury Department.\\n\\n \"How the hell could this have happened?\" Robert Di Silva\u0027s voice was trembling with rage.

Colfax is dead!\"\\n\\n The man from the Treasury Department spoke up. \"How much does Colfax\u0027s death hurt us?\"\\n\\n \"A hell of a lot,\" Di Silva replied. \"Putting a man on a witness stand is one thing. Showing a lot of ledgers and accounts is something else. You can bet your ass that some smart attorney\u0027s going to start talking about how those books could have been faked.\"\\n\\n \"Where do we go from here?\" a man from the Treasury Department asked.\\n\\n The District Attorney replied, \"We keep doing what we\u0027re doing. Jennifer Parker\u0027s on her way back from Singapore. We have enough to put her away forever. While she\u0027s going down, we\u0027re going to get her to pull Michael Moretti down with her.\" He turned to Adam. \"Don\u0027t you agree, Senator?\"\\n\\n Adam felt ill. \"Excuse me.\"\\n\\n He quickly left the room. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-60.html","bookId":2357,"book":{"id":2357,"title":"Rage of Angels","description":"Storyline: A worldwide bestseller first published in 1980, this novel tells the story of Jennifer Parker, a successful lawyer who is loved by two men, one a politician, the other, a mafia don.
