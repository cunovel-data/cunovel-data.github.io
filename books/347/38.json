{"id":17899,"no":38,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII — FORD TAKES A BOLD STEP, BUT FAILS","content":"“I wish to see Miss Stone,” said Willis Ford, to the servant. “I\u0027ll tell her. What name shall I say?” “Never mind about the name. I wish to see her on business of importance.” “I don\u0027t like his looks,” thought the maid. “Shure he talks as if he was the boss.” She told Miss Stone, however, that a gentleman wished to see her, who would not tell his name. Miss Stone was in Herbert\u0027s chamber, and the boy—now nearly well, quite well, in fact, but for a feeling of languor and weakness—heard the message. “What is he like?” he asked, anxiously. “He\u0027s slender like, with black hair and a black mustache, and he talks like he was the master of the house.” “I think it is Willis Ford,” said Herbert, turning pale. “The man who abducted you?” ejaculated Miss Stone. “Yes, the same man. Don\u0027t let him take me away,” implored Herbert. “I wish my brother were here,” said Miss Stone, anxiously. “Won\u0027t he be here soon?” “I am afraid not. He has gone on a round of calls. Bridget, tell the young man I will be down directly.” Five minutes later Miss Stone descended, and found Willis Ford fuming with impatience. “I am here, sir,” she said, coldly. “I understand you wish to see me.” “Yes, madam; will you answer me a few questions?” “Possibly. Let me hear what they are.” “You have a boy in this house, named Herbert Reynolds?” “Yes.” “A boy who ran away from Mr. Joel Barton, with whom I placed him?” “What right had you to place him anywhere, Mr. Ford?” demanded the lady. “That\u0027s my business. Permit me to say that it is no affair of yours.” “I judge differently. The boy is sick and under my charge.” “I am his natural guardian, madam.” “Who made you so, Mr. Ford?” “I shall not argue that question. It is enough that I claim him as my cousin and ward.” “Your cousin?” “Certainly. That doubtless conflicts with what he has told you. He was always a liar.” “His story is, that you beguiled him from his home in New York, and brought him against his will to this part of the country.” “And you believe him?” sneered Ford. “I do.” “It matters little whether you do or not. He is my sister\u0027s child, and is under my charge. I thought fit to place him with Mr. Joel Barton, of Scipio, but the boy, who is flighty, was induced to run away with Barton\u0027s son, a lazy, shiftless fellow.” “Supposing this to be so, Mr. Ford, what is your object in calling?” “To reclaim him. It does not suit me to leave him here.” Ford\u0027s manner was so imperative that Miss Stone became alarmed. “The boy is not fit to travel,” she said. “Wait till my brother comes, and he will decide, being a physician, whether it is safe to have him go.” “Madam, this subterfuge will not avail,” said Ford, rudely. “I will not wait till your brother comes. I prefer to take the matter into my own hands.” He pressed forward to the door of the room, and before Miss Stone could prevent it, was on his way upstairs. She followed as rapidly as she could, but before she could reach him, Ford had dashed into the room where Herbert lay on the bed. Herbert was stricken with terror when he saw the face of his enemy. “I see you know me,” said Ford, with an evil smile. “Get up at once, and prepare to go with me.” “Leave me here, Mr. Ford. I can\u0027t go with you; Indeed, I can\u0027t,” said Herbert. “We\u0027ll see about that,” said Ford. “I give you five minutes to rise and put on your clothes. If you don\u0027t obey me, I will flog you.” Looking into his cruel face, Herbert felt that he had no other resource. Trembling, he slipped out of bed, and began to draw on his clothes. He felt helpless, but help was nearer than he dreamed. “Mr. Ford, I protest against this high-handed proceeding,” exclaimed Miss Stone, indignantly, as she appeared at the door of the chamber. “What right have you to go over my house without permission?” “If it comes to that,” sneered Ford, “what right have you to keep my ward from me?” “I am not his ward,” said Herbert, quickly. “The boy is a liar,” exclaimed Ford, harshly. “Get back into the bed, Herbert,” said Miss Stone. “This man shall not take you away.” “Perhaps you will tell me how you are going to help it,” retorted Ford, with an evil smile. “If my brother were here—-” “But your brother is not here, and if he were, I would not allow him to interfere between me and my cousin. Herbert, unless you continue dressing, I shall handle you roughly.” But sounds were heard upon the stairs, and Ford, as well as Miss Stone, turned their eyes to the door. The first to enter was Abner. “Oh, it\u0027s you, is it?” said Ford, contemptuously. He had thought it might be Dr. Stone, whom he was less inclined to face than he professed. “Yes, it is. What are you doing here?” “It is none of your business, you cub. He\u0027s got to come with me.” “Maybe you want me, too?” “I wouldn\u0027t take you as a gift.” “Ho, ho,” laughed Abner, “I reckon you\u0027d find me a tough customer. You won\u0027t take bub, either.” “Who is to prevent me?” “I will!” said a new voice, and Grant Thornton, who had fallen in with Abner outside, walked quietly into the room. Willis Ford started back in dismay. Grant was the last person he expected to meet here. He had no idea that any one of the boy\u0027s home friends had tracked him this far. He felt that he was defeated, but he hated to acknowledge it. “How are you going to prevent me, you young whippersnapper?” he said, glaring menacingly at Grant. “Mr. Willis Ford, unless you leave this room and this town at once,” said Grant, firmly, “I will have you arrested. There is a local officer below whom I brought with me, suspecting your object in coming here.” “Oh, Grant, how glad I am to see you! Is papa with you?” exclaimed Herbert, overjoyed. “I will tell you about it soon, Herbert.” “You won\u0027t let him take me away?” “There is no danger of that,” said Grant, reassuringly. “I shall take you home to New York as soon as this good lady says you are well enough to go.” Ford stood gnawing his nether lip. If it had been Mr. Reynolds, he would not have minded so much; but for a mere boy, like Grant Thornton, to talk with such a calm air of superiority angered him. “Boy,” he said, “it sounds well for you to talk of arrest—you who stole my aunt\u0027s bonds, and are indebted to her forbearance for not being at this moment in State\u0027s prison.” “Your malicious charge does not affect me, Mr. Ford,” returned Grant. “It was proved before you left New York that you were the thief, and even your stepmother must have admitted it. Mr. Reynolds discharged you from his employment, and this is the mean revenge you have taken—the abduction of his only son.” “I will do you an injury yet, you impudent boy,” said Ford, furiously. “I shall be on my guard, Mr. Ford,” answered Grant. “I believe you capable of it.” “Don\u0027t you think you had better leave us, sir?” said Miss Stone. “I shall take my own time about going,” he answered, impudently. But his words were heard by Dr. Stone, who had returned sooner than he anticipated, and was already at the door of the room. He was a powerful man, and of quick temper. His answer was to seize Ford by the collar and fling him downstairs. “This will teach you to be more polite to a lady,” he said. “Now, what does all this mean, and who is this man?” The explanation was given. “I wish I had been here before,” said the doctor. “You were in good time,” said Grant, smiling. “I see that Herbert has found powerful friends.” Willis Ford, angry and humiliated, picked himself up, but did not venture to return to the room he had left so ignominiously. Like most bullies, he was a coward, and he did not care to encounter the doctor again. Within an hour, Grant telegraphed to the broker at his office: “I have found Herbert, and will start for New York with him to-morrow.” Mr. Reynolds had only just returned from his fruitless Southern expedition, weary and dispirited. But he forgot all his fatigue when he read this message. “God bless Grant Thornton!” he ejaculated.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976/82037.html","bookId":347,"book":{"id":347,"title":"Helping Himself","description":"简介： I wish we were not so terribly poor, Grant, said Mrs. Thornton, in a discouraged tone....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM"}}
