{"id":17885,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV — STARTLING NEWS","content":"Willis Ford\u0027s feelings were far from enviable when he took leave of the office in which he had long enjoyed an excellent position. He was conscious, though scarcely willing to admit it, that his misfortunes had been brought upon him by his own unwise, not to say criminal, course. None the less, however, was he angry with those whom he had connected with the disaster that had come upon him. He had always disliked Grant Thornton. Now he hated him, and thirsted for an opportunity to do him mischief. Next he felt embittered against Mr. Reynolds, who had discharged him, though it is hardly possible to see how the broker could have done otherwise. This dislike was increased within a few days, and for this reason. Ford addressed a letter to Mr. Reynolds, requesting a certificate of good character, which would enable him to procure a new situation. To this request the broker answered substantially as follows: “I shall be glad to hear that you have changed your course, and have decided to lead an honest lift; but, for the same reason that I am not willing to retain you in my employment, I am unwilling to recommend you without reserve to another business man. If you are willing to refer him to me, on condition that I tell the truth, I will cheerfully testify that you have discharged your office duties to my satisfaction.” “The old fool!” muttered Ford, angrily crushing the letter in his hand. “What use would such a recommendation be to me? Not content with discharging me, he wants to keep me out of employment.” In truth, Willis Ford hardly knew where to turn. He had saved no money, and was earning nothing. In his dilemma he turned to his stepmother. One forenoon, after he knew the broker and Grant would be out of the way, he rang the bell, and inquired for the housekeeper. Mrs. Estabrook was agitated when she saw her step-son. She did not like to believe that he had robbed her, but it was hard to believe otherwise. “Oh, Willis!” she said almost bursting into tears, “how could you take my small savings? I would not have believed you capable of it!” “You don\u0027t mean to say, mother,” returned Willis, with well-dissembled and reproachful sorrow, “that you believe this monstrous slander?” “I don\u0027t want to believe it, Willis, heaven knows. But were not the bonds found in your room?” “I admit it,” said Ford; “but how did they get there?” “Did you not put them there?” “Certainly not, mother. I thought you knew me better than that.” “But who, then—” began his step-mother, looking bewildered. “Who should it be but that boy?” “Grant Thornton?” “Yes.” “Have you any proof of this?” asked the housekeeper, eagerly. “I will tell you what I have found out. I learn that a boy called, on the day in question, at my room and asked to see me. Being told that I was out, he asked leave to go up and wait for me. As the servant had no suspicion, he was allowed to go up. I don\u0027t know how long he stayed; but no doubt he had the bonds with him and concealed them where they were found.” “Did you ask for a description of the boy? Was it like Grant?” asked the housekeeper, quickly. “Unfortunately, the girl did not take particular notice of him. I have no doubt that it was either Grant or the telegraph boy, who seems to have been in the plot.”\u0027 Now, this story was an audacious fiction, and should not have imposed upon a person of ordinary intelligence; but the housekeeper was anxious to believe her step-son innocent and Grant guilty. She therefore accepted it without question, and was loud in her denunciation of that “artful young rascal.” “You ought to tell Mr. Reynolds of this, Willis,” she said. “It would be of no use, mother. He is too strongly prejudiced against me. What do you think? He has refused me a letter of recommendation. What does he care if I starve?” concluded Willis, bitterly. “But I care, Willis. I will not desert you,” said Mrs. Estabrook, in a tone of sympathy. This was just the mood in which Ford desired his step-mother to be. He was desirous of effecting a loan, and after a time succeeded in having transferred to him two of the one-hundred-dollar bonds. He tried hard to obtain the five hundred, but Mrs. Estabrook was too prudent and too much attached to her savings to consent to this. Ford had to be satisfied with considerably less. “Ought I to stay with Mr. Reynolds after he has treated you in this way, Willis?” asked his step-mother, anxiously. “By all means, mother. You don\u0027t want to throw away a good position.” “But it will be hard to see that boy high in Mr. Reynolds\u0027 confidence, after all his wickedness.” “You must dissemble, mother. Treat him fairly, and watch your opportunity to harm him and serve me. Don\u0027t say much about me, for it would do no good; but keep your hold on Reynolds.” “If you think it best, Willis,” said his stepmother, not without a feeling of relief, for she was reluctant to relinquish a good home and liberal salary, “I will remain.” “Do so by all means. We may as well make all we can out of the enemy, for Mr. Reynolds has treated me very shabbily. And now I must bid you good-by.” “What are your plans, Willis?” “I can\u0027t tell you, but I think I shall go West.” “And I shall never see you!” “You will hear from me, and I hope I shall have good news to write.” Willis Ford left the house, and, going to the Grand Central Depot, bought a ticket for Chicago. Now came quite a pleasant period after the trouble and excitement. Grant found his duties at the office increased, and it was pleasant to see that his employer reposed confidence in him. His relations with others in the office were pleasant, now that Willis Ford was away, and every day he seemed to get new insight into the details of the business. Whether Jim Morrison and Tom Calder were in the city, he did not know. At all events, they were never seen in the neighborhood of Wall Street. Grant was not sorry to have them pass out of his life, for he did not consider that he was likely to draw any benefit from their presence and companionship. He was still a member of Mr. Reynolds\u0027 house-hold. Herbert appeared to be as much attached to him as if he were an older brother, and the broker looked with pleasure upon the new happiness that beamed from the face of his son. As to Mrs. Estabrook, Grant had feared that she would continue to show animosity toward him, but he had nothing to complain of. She certainly did not show any cordiality in her necessary intercourse with him; but then, on the other hand, she did not manifest any desire to injure him. This was all Grant desired. He felt that under no circumstances could he have made a friend of the housekeeper. He was content to have her leave him alone. After the lapse of six months Grant expressed a desire to go home to pass a day or two. His mother\u0027s birthday was close at hand, and he had bought for her a present which he knew would be acceptable. Permission was readily accorded, and Grant passed four happy days at home. His parents were pleased that he was so highly regarded by his employer, and had come to think that Grant\u0027s choice had been a wise one. When Grant returned he went at once to the office. He found it a scene of excitement. “What has happened?” he asked, eagerly. “Herbert Reynolds has disappeared, and his father is almost beside himself with grief!” was the startling reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976/82023.html","bookId":347,"book":{"id":347,"title":"Helping Himself","description":"简介： I wish we were not so terribly poor, Grant, said Mrs. Thornton, in a discouraged tone....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM"}}
