{"id":17884,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII — JUSTICE TRIUMPHS","content":"Mr. Graham turned to the broker and addressed further remarks to him. “Your statement that four hundred dollars remained to be accounted for, led me to conclude that they would be found in the possession of the party who had abstracted the others. I therefore obtained a search warrant and visited the room occupied by that gentleman, whose name I believe is Willis Ford.” This was an unexpected stroke. Ford did not speak, but kept his eyes fixed upon the detective in evident panic. “I have just come from Mr. Ford\u0027s room,” he resumed. “These are what I found there.” He drew from his pocket a long envelope, from which he took four government bonds. “Will you be kind enough, Mrs. Estabrook,” said the broker, gravely, “to examine these bonds and determine whether they are yours?” The housekeeper took them mechanically and examined them. “They are mine,” she said; “but I cannot believe Willis took them.” “I did not,” said Ford, hoarsely, but his eyes were downcast. “Will you account for their being in your room, then, Mr. Ford?” inquired the broker, sternly. “That boy must have put them there. I know nothing of them. I am as much surprised as you are.” “We have had enough of this, Mr. Ford,” said the broker, coldly. “Your guilt is evident. In robbing your stepmother you have committed a serious crime; but in attempting to throw the guilt upon an innocent boy, you have been guilty of an offense still more detestable, and one which I cannot forgive. You cannot remain in my employment another day. If you will call at the office in the morning, I will pay your salary to the end of the month. That will end all relations between us.” Willis Ford looked like a convicted criminal. For the moment all his hardihood and bravado deserted him. “Can this be true, Willis?” wailed his stepmother. “Is it possible that you took my bonds, and would have left me to an old age of poverty?” “No,” answered Ford, with a return of his usual assurance. “I am as innocent as a babe unborn. I am the victim of a conspiracy. As Mr. Reynolds is determined to shield his favorite by throwing the blame on it, I must submit. The time will come when he will acknowledge my innocence. Mother, I will satisfy you later, but I do not believe you will think me guilty. Gentlemen, I bid you all good-evening.” No one spoke as he withdrew from the room, and not even Morrison offered to follow him. When he was fairly out of the room, the broker turned to Morrison. “Mr. Morrison,” he said, “I have a question or two to put to you. I think you will find it to your interest to answer correctly. Do you still maintain that these bonds were given you by Grant Thornton?” “I may as well make a clean breast of it,” said Morrison. “They were given me by Willis Ford.” “To satisfy a gambling debt, was it not?” “Yes, sir.” “I take it for granted you did not know they were stolen?” “If I had known it I wouldn\u0027t have touched them. I might have been suspected of stealing them myself.” “I believe you.” “You\u0027re a gentleman,” said Morrison, gratified that his word was accepted. “Of course you have lost the amount which you consider due you. To be entirely candid with you, I do not feel any sympathy with you. Money won at play must be classed among ill-gotten gains. I hope you will realize this, and give up a discreditable profession.” “I have no doubt your advice is good, sir. Do you want me and Tom any longer?” “You are at liberty to go. I am indebted to you for coming. You have helped to clear up the mystery of the theft.” “He\u0027s a little hard on us, Tom,” said Morrison, as they went down the front steps, “but he\u0027s treated us like a gentleman. That Ford is a rascal.” “I think so, too,” Tom assented. “And I shall never see a cent of that six hundred dollars,” continued Jim Morrison, ruefully. “If you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ll go to my own room,” said Mrs. Estabrook, pertly. “I want to think quietly of all this.” “Go, by all means,” said the broker, courteously. “To-morrow morning your property shall be restored to you.” Next the detective and the telegraph boy withdrew, the latter rich by a five-dollar note, which Mr. Reynolds presented him. Johnny\u0027s eyes sparkled. “That will make mother happy,” he said. “She\u0027ll think I am in luck.” “Keep your eyes open, my boy, and be faithful to your employer, and this won\u0027t be the last piece of luck that will come your way.” When they were alone Mr. Reynolds turned to Grant and said kindly, “I congratulate you, Grant, on your complete vindication. Those who have wickedly conspired against you have come to grief, and you come out of the trial unscathed. As I am to part with Willis Ford, though you are not competent to take his place, your duties will be somewhat enlarged, and I will take care that your compensation shall be increased.” “I am afraid, Mr. Reynolds, I already receive more than I earn.” “That may be, but I am only anticipating a little. How much do I pay you now?” “Six dollars a week, sir.” “I will allow you four dollars more, but this additional sum I will keep in my own hands, and credit you with. It is time you were saving something for future use. Will this be satisfactory to you?” “You are very kind, Mr. Reynolds,” said Grant. “I don\u0027t know how to thank you.” “Then I will tell you—be faithful in your duties in the office and continue your kindness to Herbert.” “Gladly, sir.” Grant decided not to write to his mother about his increase in salary. He preferred to wait till his savings amounted to a considerable sum, and then surprise her by the announcement of his good fortune. In six months, he estimated, he would have more than a hundred dollars, and this to the country minister\u0027s son seemed a large sum. At any rate, when he was twenty-one he might hope to be the possessor of a thousand dollars. This opened to Grant a brilliant prospect. It was probably all his father was worth, including all his possessions. “In spite of my uncle\u0027s opposition,” thought Grant, “I think I acted wisely in preferring business to college. Now I shall be able to make the family more comfortable.” When Willis Ford called at the office the next morning Grant was gone to the post office. As he returned he met Ford coming out with a check in his hand. “So it\u0027s you, is it?” sneered Ford, stopping short. “Yes, Mr. Ford.” “I suppose you are exulting over your victory?” “You are mistaken,” said Grant. “It was not my wish that anything unpleasant should happen.” “I suppose not,” said Ford, in an unpleasant tone. “For some reason you have shown a dislike to me from the first,” Grant proceeded. “I don\u0027t know why. I have always treated you with respect and tried to do my duty faithfully.” “You are a little angel, to be sure.” “Have you any objection to telling me why you dislike me?” he asked. “Yes, I\u0027ll tell you. It is because I see how you are trying to worm yourself into the confidence of Mr. Reynolds. You have plotted against me, and now, thanks to you, I have lost my place.” “I don\u0027t consider myself the cause of that, Mr. Ford.” “I do. But you needn\u0027t exult too much. I generally pay my debts, and I shan\u0027t forget what I owe you. I will be even with you some day.” So saying, he walked off, and Grant returned to his work. “I can\u0027t understand why Mr. Ford should hate me so,” he thought.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976/82022.html","bookId":347,"book":{"id":347,"title":"Helping Himself","description":"简介： I wish we were not so terribly poor, Grant, said Mrs. Thornton, in a discouraged tone....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM"}}
