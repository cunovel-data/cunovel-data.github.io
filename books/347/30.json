{"id":17891,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXX — A MODEL HOUSEHOLD","content":"“When did you come?” asked Barton, steadying himself against a tree. “Half an hour ago,” answered Abner, for Herbert was gazing, with a repulsion he found it difficult to conceal, at Barton, whose flushed face and thick utterance indicated his condition very clearly. “Who came with him?” continued Barton. “You\u0027d better ask marm. She attended to the business. It was a young man.” “Where is she?” “Gone to the village to buy some sassiges for dinner.” “Good!” exclaimed Barton, in a tone of satisfaction. “I\u0027ll stay at home to dinner to-day. Did the man pay your mother any money?” “I s\u0027pose so, or she wouldn\u0027t be buyin\u0027 sassiges. Old Schickman won\u0027t trust us any more.” “The money should have been paid to me. I\u0027ll see about it when your marm comes back from the store.” “You\u0027d spend it all for drink, dad,” said Abner. “How dare you speak so to your father, you ungrateful young dog!” He essayed to reach Abner to strike him, but his dutiful son dodged easily, and his father, being unsteady on his legs, fell on the ground. Abner laughed, but Herbert was too much shocked to share in his enjoyment. “Come here and help me up, you Abner!” said his father. “Not much, dad! If you hadn\u0027t tried to lick me you wouldn\u0027t have fallen!” “Let me help you, sir!” said Herbert, conquering his instinctive disgust and approaching the fallen man. “You\u0027re a gentleman!” murmured Barton, as he took the little boy\u0027s proffered hand and, after considerable ado, raised himself to a standing position. “You\u0027re a gentleman; I wish I had a boy like you.” Herbert could not join in the wish. He felt that a father like Joel Barton would be a great misfortune. But just then Mrs. Barton entered the yard, marching with long strides like a man\u0027s. “Here\u0027s marm!” announced Abner. Barton steadied himself as he turned to look at his wife. “I want to see you, Mrs. B.,” he said. “When are you goin\u0027 to have dinner?” “Never, if I depended on you to supply the vittles!” she answered, bluntly. “Don\u0027t speak so before a stranger,” said Barton, with a hiccough. “You hurt my feelin\u0027s.” “Your feelin\u0027s are tough, and so are mine by this time.” “What have you got there?” “Some sassiges. Ef you want your share, you\u0027ll have to be on time. I shan\u0027t save you any.” “How much money did the man pay you, Mrs. B.?” “That\u0027s my business!” retorted his wife, shortly. “Mrs. B.,” said her husband, straightening up, “I want you to understand that I\u0027m the master of this house, and it\u0027s my right to take care of the money. You\u0027ll oblige me by handin\u0027 it over.” “I\u0027ll do nothing of the sort, Joel Barton! You\u0027d only spend it for drink.” “Would you grudge me the few pennies I spend for drink? My system requires it. That\u0027s what the doctor says.” “Then you must find the money for it yourself. My system requires something to eat, and, ef I take a boarder, he\u0027s got to have something to eat, too.” “Mrs. B., I didn\u0027t think your heart was so hard,” said Barton, in a maudlin tone. “Look here, Joel Barton; you might as well stop such foolish talk. It won\u0027t do no good. I can\u0027t stay here all day. I must go and be gettin\u0027 dinner.” Had Barton succeeded in raising money from his wife, he would probably have returned at once to the tavern, and his place would have been vacant at the dinner table. Failing in this, he lay back and fell asleep, and was not roused till dinner time. Mrs. Barton was a fair cook, and Herbert ate with an unexpected relish. It is needless to say that Abner also did full justice to the meal. “I say, Sam,” he said, “I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come.” Herbert was hardly prepared to agree with him. “Now we\u0027ll have to live better,” Abner explained. “Mam and I gen\u0027ally have to skirmish round for vittles. We don\u0027t often get meat.” This frank confession rather alarmed Herbert. He was not over self-indulgent, but he had never lacked for nourishing food, and the prospect of an uncertain supply was not encouraging. When dinner was over—there was no second course—they left the table. Joel Barton made a fresh attempt to extort a small sum from his wife, but was met with an inflexible refusal. Mrs. Barton proved deaf alike to entreaties and threats. She was a strong, resolute woman, and not one to be intimidated. When Barton left the house, his look of disappointment had given place to one of cunning. “Come here, Abner!” he said, beckoning to his son and heir. “What for?” “Never you mind.” “But I do mind. Do you want to catch hold of me?” “No; it\u0027s only a little matter of business. It\u0027s for your good.” Abner accompanied his father as far as the fence. “Now, what do you want?” he asked, with his eyes warily fixed on his father. “I want you to find out where your marm keeps that money,” said Barton, in a coaxing tone. “What for?” “You\u0027re to take it and bring it to me.” “And go without eatin\u0027?” “I\u0027ll buy the provisions myself. I\u0027m the head of the family.” “Do you want me to hook money from marm?” “\u0027Twon\u0027t be hookin\u0027. The money by right belongs to me. Ain\u0027t I the head of the family?” “I dunno about that. Marm\u0027s the boss, and always has been,” chuckled Abner. Joel frowned, but immediately tried another attack. “Of course I\u0027ll give you some of it, Abner,” he resumed. “If there\u0027s five dollars I\u0027ll give you a quarter.” “I\u0027ll see about it, dad.” “Get it for me before evenin\u0027, if you can. I shall need it then.” Abner returned to Herbert, and frankly related the conversation that had taken place between himself and his father. Herbert was shocked. He did not know what to think of the singular family he had got into. “You won\u0027t do it, will you?” he asked, startled. “No, I won\u0027t. I want a quarter bad enough, but I\u0027d rather mam would keep the money. She\u0027ll spend it for vittles, and dad would spend it for drink. Wouldn\u0027t you like to go a-fishin\u0027? It\u0027s fine weather, and we\u0027ll have fun.” Herbert assented, not knowing how to dispose of his time. Abner turned the conversation again on New York. What Herbert had already told him had powerfully impressed his imagination. “Haven\u0027t you got any money?” he asked. “No,” answered Herbert. “Mr. Ford took away all I had, except this.” He drew from his pocket a nickel. “That won\u0027t do no good,” said Abner, disappointed. “Stop a minute, though,” he added, after a minute\u0027s pause. “Wouldn\u0027t your folks send you some money, if you should write to them?” “Yes,” answered Herbert, his face brightening. “Why didn\u0027t I think of that before? If I could get me paper and ink I\u0027d write at once to papa. I know he\u0027d either send the money or come for me.” “We\u0027ll go to the post office,” said Abner. “There you can buy some paper and a postage stamp. You\u0027ve got just money enough. There\u0027s a pen and ink there.” “Let us go at once,” said Herbert, eagerly. The boys took their way to the village. The letter was written and posted, and a burden was lifted from the boy\u0027s mind. He felt that his father would seek him out at once, and he could bear his present position for a short time. But, alas! for poor Herbert—the letter never came into his father\u0027s hands. Why, the reader will learn in the next chapter. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976/82029.html","bookId":347,"book":{"id":347,"title":"Helping Himself","description":"简介： I wish we were not so terribly poor, Grant, said Mrs. Thornton, in a discouraged tone....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM"}}
