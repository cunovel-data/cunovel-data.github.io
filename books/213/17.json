Just as I was going on the platform a messenger delivered to me an envelope with my name on it, and this written under it; \"Please read one of these to-night.\" Inclosed were a couple of newspaper clippings--two versions of an anecdote, one German, the other English. I was minded to try the German one on those people, just to see what would happen, but my courage weakened when I noticed the formidable look of the closing word, and I gave it up. A pity, too, for it ought to read well on the platform and get an encore. That or a brickbat. There is never any telling what a new audience will do; their tastes are capricious. The point of this anecdote is a justifiable gibe at the German long word, and is not as much of an exaggeration as one might think. The German long word is not a legitimate construction, but an ignoble artificiality, a sham. It has no recognition by the dictionary and is not found there. It is made by jumbling a lot of words into one, in a quite unnecessary way; it is a lazy device of the vulgar and a crime against the language. Nothing can be gained, no valuable amount of space saved, by jumbling the following words together on a visiting card: \"Mrs. Smith, widow of the late Commander-in-chief of the Police Department,\" yet a German widow can persuade herself to do it, without much trouble: \"Mrs.-late-commander-in-chief-of-the-police-department\u0027s-widow-Smith.\" This is the English version of the anecdote: A Dresden paper, the Weidmann, which thinks that there are kangaroos (Beutelratte) in South Africa, says the Hottentots (Hottentoten) put them in cages (kotter) provided with covers (lattengitter) to protect them from the rain. The cages are therefore called lattengitterwetterkotter, and the imprisoned kangaroo lattengitterwetterkotterbeutelratte. One day an assassin (attent?ter) was arrested who had killed a Hottentot woman (Hottentotenmutter), the mother of two stupid and stuttering children in Str?ttertrotel. This woman, in the German language is entitled Hottentotenstrottertrottelmutter, and her assassin takes the name Hottentotenstrottermutterattent?ter. The murderer was confined in a kangaroo\u0027s cage--Beutelrattenlattengitterwetterkotter--whence a few days later he escaped, but fortunately he was recaptured by a Hottentot, who presented himself at the mayor\u0027s office with beaming face. \"I have captured the Beutelratte,\" said he. \"Which one?\" said the mayor; \"we have several.\" \"The Attent?terlattengitterwetterkotterbeutelratte.\" \"Which attent?ter are you talking about?\" \"About the Hottentotenstrottertrottelmutterattent?ter.\" \"Then why don\u0027t you say at once the Hottentotenstrottelmutterattent?terlattengitterwetterkotterbeutelratte?\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/28/154.html","bookId":213,"book":{"id":213,"title":"The Autobiography of Mark Twain","description":"简介： In this Autobiography I shall keep in mind the fact that I am speaking from the grave.
