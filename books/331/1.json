{"id":29514,"no":1,"title":"The 9,000 Year Prologue","content":"The flotillas of the dead sailed around the world on underwater rivers.\n Very nearly nobody knew about them. But the theory is easy to understand.\n It runs: the sea is, after all, in many respects only a wetter form of air. And it is known that air is denser the lower you go and lighter the higher you fly. As a storm-tossed ship founders and sinks, therefore, it must reach a depth where the water below it is just viscous enough to stop its fall.\n In short, it stops sinking and ends up floating on an underwater surface, beyond the reach of the storms but far above the ocean floor.\n It’s calm there. Dead calm.\n Some stricken ships have rigging; some even have sails. Many still have crew, tangled in the rigging or lashed to the wheel.\n But the voyages still continue, aimlessly, with no harbour in sight, because there are currents under the ocean and so the dead ships with their skeleton crews sail on around the world, over sunken cities and between drowned mountains, until rot and shipworms eat them away and they disintegrate.\n Sometimes an anchor drops, all the way to the dark, cold calmness of the abyssal plain, and disturbs the stillness of centuries by throwing up a cloud of silt.\n One nearly hit Anghammarad, where he sat watching the ships drift by, far overhead.\n He remembered it, because it was the only really interesting thing to happen for nine thousand years.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/339/621.html","bookId":331,"book":{"id":331,"title":"开始邮政 Going Postal","description":"简介： Going Postal is Terry Pratchett\u0027s 33rd Discworld novel, released in the United Kingdom on September 25, 2004.
