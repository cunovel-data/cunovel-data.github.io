He sat against a tree, watching her with bloodshot eyes.\\n\\n “You were?”\\n\\n Roar nodded. “Talon and Liv were there too. We were starting a collection for Talon, each of us making a different one for him. Liv nicked her finger barely five minutes in.” He smiled faintly, lost in the memory. “She’s a brute with the knife. No finesse at all. She and I quit after a few minutes, but Perry kept at it for Talon.”\\n\\n Aria ran her thumb over the smooth surface. Every one of them, at one time, had held the falcon resting in her palm. Would they ever be together—all of them?\\n\\n She spent the next hour adjusting to the sounds of the woods, staring at the figurine in her hand, taking the first watch as Roar drifted asleep. There were wolves out here. Bands of drifters and cannibals. She picked out the patterns in the wind and the rustle of animals, listening until she was sure they were safe. Then she put the falcon away and found her Smarteye.\\n\\n Three days had passed since she’d contacted Hess on the beach. She glanced at Roar, asleep, and then applied the device. The Eye attached as the biotech activated, and her Smartscreen popped up.\\n\\n She chose the Hess icon and then felt the familiar tug of fractioning, that moment when her mind adjusted to being here and here. She’d appeared at a café in a Venetian Realm. Gondolas glided along the Grand Canal just steps away, roses floating in the sparkling, clear water. It was a beautiful, sunny day, golden and warm. Somewhere, a string quartet played, the notes thin and brittle.\\n\\n Hess appeared across the small table. He had modified his clothing this time, wearing an ivory-colored suit with light blue pinstripes and a red tie. He’d given himself a tan, but the effect was odd. He looked strangely older—or, rather, closer to his true age of well over a hundred—and his skin was orange. So unlike Perry’s bronze skin.\\n\\n Hess frowned at her clothes. Before she could utter a word, she felt a jolt, like her entire body had blinked. She looked down. A royal-blue silk dress clung to her like a second skin.\\n\\n Hess smiled. “That’s better.”\\n\\n Her heart started drumming with anger. “Much,” she said.\\n\\n A waiter arrived with a tray of coffees. Dark-eyed and handsome, he could have been Roar’s brother. He smiled as he set the drinks on the table. A warm breeze blew past, carrying the spicy scent of cologne and shifting Aria’s hair on her bare back. It was all so normal and safe and charming. A year ago, Paisley would’ve been kicking her under the table over the waiter’s smile. Caleb would have looked up from his sketchbook and rolled his eyes. She was suddenly furious at how difficult life was now.\\n\\n Hess sipped his coffee. “Are you well, Aria?”\\n\\n Did he know she’d been poisoned? Could he tell through the Eye? Through her body chemistry? “I’m terrific,” she said. “How are you?”\\n\\n “Terrific,” he said, matching her sarcasm. “You’re on your way now. Are you traveling alone?”\\n\\n “What do you care?”\\n\\n Hess’s eyes narrowed on her. “We detected a storm near you.”\\n\\n Aria smirked. “I detected it too.”\\n\\n “I can imagine.”\\n\\n “No, you really can’t. I need to know if something’s happening in Reverie, Hess. Were you hit by the storm? Has there been any damage?”\\n\\n He blinked at her. “You’re a smart girl. What do you think?”\\n\\n “It doesn’t matter what I think. I need to know. I need proof that Talon is all right. I want to see my friends. And I want to know what you’re going to do when I give you the location of the Still Blue. Are you moving the entire Pod? How will you do that?” Aria leaned across the table. “I know what I’m doing, but what about you? What about everything else?”\\n\\n Hess tapped his fingers on the marble tabletop. “You’re quite fascinating now. Life among the Savages suits you.”\\n\\n Suddenly the Realm plunged into silence. Aria looked to the canal. The gondola had frozen on water that was as still as glass. A flock of pigeons hung in the air above, caught in mid-flight. People looked around them, panic on their faces; then the Realm snapped back, sound and movement returning.\\n\\n “What was that?” she demanded. “Answer me, or we’re done.”\\n\\n Hess took another sip of coffee and watched the traffic in the Grand Canal like nothing had just happened. “Do you think you can fraction if I don’t want you to?” He looked back at her. “We’re done when I say so.”\\n\\n Aria grabbed her coffee and flung it at him. The dark liquid splattered over his face and his pale suit. Hess jerked back, gasping, even though it hadn’t hurt him. Nothing in the Realms could inflict true pain. The most he would feel was warmth, but she’d surprised him. She had his attention now.\\n\\n “Still want me to stay?” she asked.\\n\\n He disappeared before she’d finished speaking, leaving her to stare at an empty chair. Though she knew it would be pointless, she tried to shut off the Eye. She was ready to be back—completely—in the real.\\n\\n UNAUTHORIZED COMMAND flashed on her Smartscreen.\\n\\n Now what? The waiter peered through the café window, interest sparking in his eyes. Aria turned away, looking toward the canal. A couple embraced at the top of the ornate cement bridge, watching the water traffic below. She tried to imagine that she was the one pressed against the rail. That it was Perry brushing her hair aside and whispering in her ear. Perry had hated the Realms. She couldn’t form the picture in her mind.\\n\\n A time counter appeared at the upper corner of her Smartscreen. It ticked down from thirty minutes. Aria braced herself. Hess was up to something.\\n\\n In the next moment, she fractioned to another Realm, appearing on a wooden pier. The ocean lapped gently below, and gulls cried overhead, the sounds garish parodies of their real versions. A boy sat at the very end of the pier. He faced out to sea, but Aria knew exactly who he was.\\n\\n Talon.\\n\\n She felt sick. She’d wanted to know that Perry’s nephew was well, but she wasn’t sure she wanted to know him. She didn’t want to care any more than she already did. And what was she supposed to say to him? Talon didn’t even know her. She looked down at herself. At least she was back in her usual black clothes.\\n\\n The time counter now read twenty-eight minutes. She’d been standing there for two minutes. She shook her head at herself, and went to him.\\n\\n “Talon?”\\n\\n He leaped to his feet and faced her, his eyes wide with surprise. She’d never met Talon, but she’d seen him once before. Months ago, when Perry had visited Talon in the Realms, she’d been watching on a wallscreen. He was a striking boy, with curling brown hair and serious green eyes, their color darker, richer than Perry’s.\\n\\n “Who are you?” he asked.\\n\\n “A friend of your uncle’s.”\\n\\n He glared at her suspiciously. “Then how come I don’t know you?”\\n\\n “I met him after you were brought into Reverie. I’m Aria. I was with Perry when he came to see you in the Realms last fall.... I was helping him from the outside.”\\n\\n Talon wedged his fishing rod between the slats on the wooden pier. “So you’re a Dweller?”\\n\\n “Yes … and an Outsider, too. I’m half of both.”\\n\\n “Oh.... Where are you? Outside or in Reverie?”\\n\\n “Outside. I’m actually … I’m sitting next to Roar.”\\n\\n Talon’s eyes brightened. “Roar’s there?”\\n\\n “He’s asleep, but when he wakes, I’ll tell him you said hello.” Another pole rested by the pier. Talon was using two. He was a Tider, she realized. He’d probably fished for all of his eight years. “Can I join you?”\\n\\n He didn’t look happy about it, but he said, “Sure.”\\n\\n Aria picked up the extra rod and sat next to him. She couldn’t believe that after a few days in a fishing settlement, she was now fishing in the Realms. She studied the wooden pole in her hands, realizing she had no idea how to cast it. She’d gone fishing in another Realm before. A Space Fishing Realm, where you fired hooks at fish as you floated through the cosmos. This was fishing as the ancients had done it.\\n\\n “Umm … here,” Talon said, taking the rod from her hand. He cast out slowly, so she could see what he was doing, then handed it back.\\n\\n “Thanks,” she said.\\n\\n He shrugged without looking at her and began swinging his legs over the edge of the pier. Kicking left and right, left and right, left and right. Being still makes me tired, Perry had once told her. Apparently it ran in the family.\\n\\n “We use nets more at home,” Talon said after a while.\\n\\n “Oh, really?” She fumbled for a follow-up question. The timer read twenty-three minutes. “Do you like fishing better or hunting?”\\n\\n He looked at her like she was crazy. “I love them both.”\\n\\n “I could’ve probably guessed that. You look like you’re good at both.” He was sturdier now, healthier than when she’d seen him in the fall.\\n\\n Talon scratched his nose. “I can catch them and catch them, but this Realm doesn’t let you cook them. I tried a few times. I gathered some wood and I tried to start a fire, but it doesn’t work. There’s no fire in the Realms. I mean there is, but it’s like a pretend kind of fire?”\\n\\n Aria bit her lip, nodding. She knew that too well.\\n\\n “You have to go to a cooking Realm to cook fish, but those are barmy. And then even when you eat them, it doesn’t fill your stomach after you leave the Realms. It’s not as fun catching them when there’s no point.”\\n\\n Aria smiled. When he talked, his legs stopped swinging, and a crease appeared between his eyebrows. “I’m sure there are places where you can compete,” she suggested.\\n\\n “For what?”\\n\\n “For, you know, rankings. You could be first place.”\\n\\n “Does first place mean I get to cook and eat what I catch?”\\n\\n Aria laughed. “Probably not.”\\n\\n “Maybe I’ll try them anyway.” He looked out at the ocean and swung his legs for a while before he spoke again. “I want to go home. I want to see my uncle.”\\n\\n She felt her throat tighten. He hadn’t asked for his father. She wondered if he’d figured out what had happened between Vale and Perry, but it wasn’t her place to ask. It dawned on her that he no longer had parents. He was an orphan like she was.\\n\\n “Are you unhappy in Reverie?” she asked.\\n\\n He shook his head. “No. I just want to go home. I’m better now. The doctors here made me better.”\\n\\n “That’s good, Talon.” She remembered Perry telling her that Talon had been ill on the outside. “I’m going to get you out, and back home to the Tides. I promise.”\\n\\n He scratched his knee but didn’t say anything.\\n\\n “Do you ever fish with a friend?”\\n\\n “Clara used to come with me. She’s Brooke’s sister. Do you know Brooke?”\\n\\n Aria swallowed back a laugh. “Yes, I know Brooke. Why did Clara stop fishing with you?”\\n\\n “She got bored. She thinks this Realm is too slow now. No one likes to fish this way.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-ever-night-under-the-never-sky-2/page-16.html","bookId":1658,"book":{"id":1658,"title":"Through the Ever Night (Under the Never Sky #2)","description":"Storyline: Through the Ever Night (Under the Never Sky #2) \\n It\u0027s been months since Aria learned of her mother\u0027s death. \\n Months since Perry became Blood Lord of the Tides, and months since Aria last saw him. \\n Now Aria and Perry are about to be reunited.
