You could fool people, but you couldn\u0027t fool animals. They knew him for what he was.\n Brenna woke a moment later, her eyes wide and a little scared as she glanced around the room, noting the, windows and the window seat, the high ceilings, the striped paper on the walls.\n \"Where am I?\"\n \"My bedroom.\"\n She glanced around the room again. She could have put her whole cottage inside and had space left over.\n And then his words sank in. \"Your bedroom!\" she exclaimed. She was out of the bed and headed for the door before she finished speaking.\n She skidded to a halt, a wordless cry erupting from her lips when she reached the door and found Roshan standing there, his arms folded over his chest.\n \"Calm down, Brenna.\"\n She backed away from him and kept backing up until she bumped against the edge of the bed. \"Who are you?\"\n \"I mean you no harm.\"\n \"Who are you?\" she repeated.\n He took a step toward her, one hand outstretched.\n Fear for her life made her reckless. She wasn\u0027t certain her magick would be effective when she felt so panicky. Hurried spells had backfired on her in the past, but it was a risk she was willing to take. Summoning her fear and the anger generated by it, Brenna pointed her finger in Roshan\u0027s direction, and muttered a hurried incantation.\n Morgana hissed, the hairs raising along her back.\n Roshan swore a vile oath as Brenna\u0027s spell slammed into him, driving him backward. He grunted as his shoulder struck the doorjamb. Her power sizzled over his skin, momentarily holding him in place. And then he was striding toward her again.\n Brenna gasped. Any mortal man would have been rendered unconscious by her incantation. Before she could call forth the power necessary to try again, he was on her.\n He glared down at her, his hands imprisoning her arms at her sides.\n \"Don\u0027t do that again.\" He bit off each word.\n \"Let me go.\"\n He shook her until her teeth rattled. \"Dammit, woman, I\u0027m not going to hurt you.\"\n She glanced pointedly at his hands gripping her arms, his fingers digging into her flesh.\n He relaxed his hold ever so slightly but he didn\u0027t let her go.\n She stared up at him, her jaw jutting out, refusing to give an inch even though he knew she was scared. The scent of her fear, mingled with the underlying scent of her blood, inflamed his hunger. His gaze slid down, over the smooth skin of her neck, lower still, to the rise and fall of her breasts.\n Her eyes widened, her breath quickening under his regard. \"Let me go.\" It wasn\u0027t a demand now, but a plea.\n \"Brenna… \"\n \"Please.\"\n Taking a deep breath, he closed his eyes lest she see the hunger lurking in their depths. He didn\u0027t want to frighten her more than she already was. He felt the prick of his fangs against his tongue, knew he was perilously close to not only losing control of his desire but control over the beast within him as well.\n It had been a mistake to bring her here.\n With a low growl, he shoved her away from him, jerked open the door, and stalked out of the room without a backward glance. The sound of the lock turning echoed loudly in his ears.\n The house was too small to contain the wealth of emotions fomenting within him. He needed to go out, to put some distance between himself and Brenna Flanagan, but he knew himself too well, knew that if he went out now, he might not be able to control his hunger, and when he was out of control, people died.\n Muttering a vile oath, he paced the length of the long hall between the living room and the back of the house. The hunger rose within him, overpowering every other thought, every other need as it clawed at his vitals, clouding his vision with a blood-red haze.\n He didn\u0027t have to go out. There was fresh prey upstairs. A mortal woman from another century. He could take her at his will, savor each drop as he drained her of blood and life. He could easily dispose of her body. She had no one to mourn her, no one to miss her.\n Ah, he thought. There was the rub, because he would miss her, his little witch.\n What was there about Brenna Flanagan that drew him so? But for her, he would be naught but ancient ash by now, his remains scattered by an uncaring wind. One look at her portrait and he had been captivated. On the brink of seeking death, he had known he couldn\u0027t end his existence until he knew more about her. No matter what the cost, he\u0027d had to find her.\n He slammed his fist into the wall in an effort to diffuse his rage. He had traveled through time to save her from a horrible death. And was she grateful? No! She was afraid of him, had locked the door against him. Foolish woman! As if a lock and some puny slab of oak could keep him out!\n He laughed, the harsh, bitter sound echoing off the walls in the quiet house. She should be afraid. Her very life was in his hands.\n With an oath, he turned and headed for the staircase, only to pause halfway up. He stared up at the landing, his preternatural senses bringing him the scent of her blood, the rapid beating of her heart, the stink of fear that clung to her skin.\n His hands curled into tight fists as he fought against the urge to break down the door she had locked against him even as the hunger whispered in his ear.\n Sweet, it whispered. She\u0027ll be all the sweeter for the fear running in her veins. You know you want her. Take her! She\u0027s yours, yours for the taking.\n \"No!\" He roared the word as he turned on his heel, grabbed a long black cloak, and bolted from the house.\n Someone would die this night, but it would not be Brenna Flanagan.\n Driven by the urgent need to hunt, he prowled the dark streets, his body quivering with the insatiable hunger that drove him relentlessly. He had been a vampire for two hundred and eighty-six years and in all that time he had been unable to completely subdue the beast within him. Try as he might to fight it, sooner or later his hellish hunger prevailed, overcoming whatever shred of self-restraint he had thought he\u0027d gained, proving to him yet again that he was still a slave to the dark hunger that dwelled within him.\n Knowing he was near the breaking point, he fled the city and headed toward the dark underbelly of the town where the drug lords and the pimps plied their trade. Every city had such a place, an area where the city\u0027s less favorable citizens banded together. Though Roshan usually preferred hunting in more pleasant surroundings, it was here that he came when his tenuous control shattered and the hunger would not be denied. Death was not unknown here. It often came swiftly in the ongoing struggle for power.\n The sound of angry whispers drew Roshan\u0027s attention. Pausing, he lifted his head and sniffed the air, his nostrils filling with the scent of greed and whiskey.\n There. Down the alley across the street.\n His cloak billowed behind him like the shadow of death as he followed the scent of his prey, his whole body vibrating with a need that would no longer be denied.\n Brenna pressed one ear to the door, listening for some sound that would tell her Roshan\u0027s whereabouts. At first, she heard nothing, and then she heard the slam of a door. She knew immediately that he had left the house and the slamming of the door had nothing to do with that knowledge. She felt a sudden void in the house and knew he was gone. The fact that she could be so aware of his absence frightened her in away nothing else had.\n For what seemed like the hundredth time, she found herself wondering who he was. What he was. He was no mortal man, of that she was sure. But if he wasn\u0027t mortal, what was he? She had grown up on tales of otherworldly creatures. Granny O\u0027Connell had believed in all manner of supernatural beings— fairies and trolls, gnomes and goblins, werewolves and vampires, and a host of other frightening folk. Brenna had refused to believe in such beings. If they existed, where were they? Why had she never seen one? But Granny had believed and often posed the question, \"If there be witches and warlocks, why not werewolves or other fey folk? \u0027Tis only another form of magick, after all.\"\n Except for her own mother and her maternal grandmother, Brenna had never encountered any other magical or mystical folk. She didn\u0027t know what manner of creature Roshan DeLongpre might be but she knew, in the deepest part of her soul, that he was like no other man she had ever met.\n Biting down on the inside of her lower lip, she pondered the wisdom of venturing outside his bedroom. She glanced over her shoulder and a sigh shuddered through her. His bedroom. His bed. What did he intend to do with her? Why had he brought her here? He didn\u0027t even know her. Why had he traveled through time to find her?\n So many troubling questions— questions for which she had no answers.\n One thing she knew, she could not stay here, in his house, in his bedroom.\n Muttering, \"Come, Morgana,\" she unlocked the door. After looking up and down the hallway, she hurried down the stairs, out of the house, and down the long road that led to a huge, elaborately carved wrought iron gate set in a high stone wall. She wasn\u0027t surprised to find that the gate was locked.\n Lifting the hem of her dress to keep it out of the damp grass, Brenna followed the high stone wall, looking for another way out. Morgana trailed at her heels, meowing softly.\n Brenna had never seen such a vast holding in her whole life. The house, bigger by far than any she had ever seen, seemed dwarfed by the grounds that surrounded it. There were trees and bushes everywhere. In the back of the house, she found a maze and strange trees cut in the shapes of animals both real and mythical.\n She wasn\u0027t sure how much time had passed before she made her way back to the front of the house. She stared at the gate, wondering what magick she could use to open it. Calling Morgana, she held the cat in her arms while she tried a simple revocation spell, and then a nullification spell, but to no avail. Brenna tapped one foot on the ground, then frowned as a horrible thought crossed her mind. Was it possible that her magick was of no effect in this new time and place? That couldn\u0027t be it. Her magick had worked against him earlier. Had he used some magick of his own to thwart her escape? Perhaps she needed her wand to help her focus? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-kiss-children-of-the-night-1/page-8.html","bookId":2299,"book":{"id":2299,"title":"Night\u0027s Kiss (Children of The Night #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night\u0027s Kiss (Children of The Night #1) \n HE HAS FOUND HIS SOUL\u0027S DESIRE... \n The Dark Gift has brought Roshan DeLongpre a lifetime of bitter loneliness-until, by chance, he comes across a picture of Brenna Flanagan.
