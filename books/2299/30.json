Just do not turn him away if he comes to you again.\"\\n\\n \"All right. I\u0027ll do whatever I can.\" His gaze moved over her, hot and hungry. And then, unable to resist when she was so near, he drew her into his arms and kissed her. The hunger rose quickly within him, clawing at his vitals, reminding him that he had not fed this night A seductive voice in the back of his mind whispered that there was no need for him to go out for sustenance, not when she was in his arms, warm and vibrant with life.\\n\\n Abruptly, he released her and turned his back to her. \"I\u0027m going out,\" he said, his voice gruff. \"Lock the door after me.\"\\n\\n Before she could reply, he was gone from her sight. He hunted with single-minded intensity, refusing to think of Brenna, refusing to think of anything but the hunger that must be fed.\\n\\n A scream from outside an apartment building drew his attention. When he arrived, he saw a man and a woman thrashing around on the ground. At first glance, they appeared to be in the throes of passion, but then the woman cried out again, her voice filled with fear and loathing.\\n\\n \"Shut up, you whore!\" Sitting back on his heels, the man struck the woman across the face, splitting her lower lip. The scent of fresh blood wafted through the air.\\n\\n \"Let me go!\" she shrieked. \"Help me! Someone, please help me!\"\\n\\n The man cursed as Roshan\u0027s hand closed around his shoulder. After dragging the man off the woman and spinning him around, Roshan drove his fist into the man\u0027s face. There was a satisfying crunch as the man\u0027s nose broke. Blood sprayed through the air. Roshan inhaled deeply, then tossed the man aside like so much rubbish.\\n\\n The woman stared up at him, her eyes wide, no doubt wondering if he had come to her rescue, or if he intended to finish what the other man had started.\\n\\n \"Are you all right?\" Roshan asked.\\n\\n She nodded. \"Y-yes, I think so.\"\\n\\n His gaze moved over her. She was in her early thirties, with brown hair and blue eyes, one of which was already turning black from where she\u0027d been hit. There was a nasty bruise on her left cheek; blood oozed from the cut on her lower lip.\\n\\n \"Do you live here?\" he asked, nodding at the apartment building behind her.\\n\\n \"Yes. I was just coming home from work. I\u0027m a nurse… \" She recoiled when he offered her his hand.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to hurt you.\" He kept his voice low, reassuring. Hypnotic. \"Do you live alone?\"\\n\\n He was a stranger. It was in her mind to lie, to say she lived with a roommate, but she couldn\u0027t lie to him, not when his gaze was locked with hers.\\n\\n \"Yes, alone.\"\\n\\n Taking her by the hand, he drew her to her feet, men picked up her handbag and offered it to her.\\n\\n \"Come,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll see you safely home.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said. \"Safely home.\"\\n\\n She lived in a modest one-bedroom apartment that, while small, was clean and neat. There were several paintings on the walls. Vases of dried flowers on the mantel and the table.\\n\\n Once inside, Roshan closed and locked the door, then took her by the hand and led her into the bedroom. Sitting her on the bed, he went into the bathroom. He found a washcloth, wet it, then went back into the bedroom and wiped the blood from her face. He offered her a drink of whiskey that he found in the kitchen cupboard, then drew her into his arms, his mind melding with hers, wiping away her fear. He fed quickly, then erased his memory from her mind. Tomorrow, she would remember only that she had fought off an attacker.\\n\\n Leaving her sleeping peacefully, he left the apartment building and returned to the Nocturne. He paused at the entrance, sniffing the air until he picked up Anthony Loken\u0027s scent.\\n\\n It led him to a large one-story brick building located on a patch of weeds on the outskirts of town. The windows were covered with boards on the inside and barred on the outside. No light showed through the cracks.\\n\\n Anthony Loken\u0027s scent was strong here, and so was that of Jimmy Dugan.\\n\\n Roshan circled the building, noting that there was only one entrance. It, too, was barred. Had this been Loken\u0027s home, Roshan would have been unable to cross the threshold without an invitation, but this was an abandoned place of business and the threshold had no power over him.\\n\\n Dissolving into mist, Roshan slipped under the narrow opening beneath one of the boards. Once inside, he resumed his own shape. Though the building was dark, his vampire sight allowed him to see everything clearly, though there was precious little to see— a wooden chair, a metal desk, a file cabinet.\\n\\n An open door led to a long hallway flanked on either side by doors that opened into empty rooms. A narrow staircase was located at the far end of the corridor.\\n\\n Roshan paused at the head of the stairs. Loken\u0027s scent was still strong, and mingled with it was the scent of blood and fear. And violent death.\\n\\n Treading softly, Roshan descended the stairs. And the scent of death grew stronger.\\n\\n There was only one door at the bottom of the stairs. Roshan tried the handle, knowing instinctively that it would be locked.\\n\\n Again dissolving into mist, he floated under the crack beneath the door. He hovered there a moment before taking on his own shape once more.\\n\\n The scent of blood was overpowering now, awakening his hunger in spite of the fact that he had just fed.\\n\\n The room was a laboratory. Metal shelves crowded with glass jars, test tubes, beakers, flasks, funnels, slides, and vials lined one wall. A rack held several test tubes filled with blood. Another shelf held several books on witchcraft, anatomy, and hematology. There was a small refrigerator on a long counter, along with a microscope and an incubator. A large gray metal file cabinet stood on one side of the door, a desk with a state-of-the-art computer and printer was on the other side. A circle of power had been drawn on the floor in the center of the room. And in the center of the circle there was a stainless steel operating table that held Jimmy Dugan\u0027s remains. His arms and legs were bound to the table with silver manacles. A thick wooden stake protruded from his chest. A long rubber tube was attached to the boy\u0027s left arm, slowly siphoning the blood from his body into a large glass container.\\n\\n Walking toward the table, Roshan felt a whisper of dark energy as he stepped inside the circle. So, Anthony Loken was not only a warlock but something of a scientist, as well.\\n\\n Roshan stared at Dugan\u0027s body. \"Foolish boy,\" he muttered. \"Why didn\u0027t you get the hell out of town while you had the chance?\"\\n\\n Turning away from the table, Roshan walked over to the desk, quickly perusing the warlock\u0027s notes, most of which he found indecipherable.\\n\\n Roshan glanced at what was left of Jimmy Dugan. Had the boy\u0027s blood provided Loken with any of the answers he was searching for? Would it enable him to come up with a formula for eternal life?\\n\\n Dissolving into mist, Roshan flowed out of the laboratory. Dugan had trusted the wrong man and it had cost him his life.\\n\\n Materializing outside the lab, Roshan stared up at the sky, at the millions of twinkling stars that faded away into infinity. Until now, even though he had known it was impossible, he hadn\u0027t realized how badly he had been hoping that Jimmy Dugan had been right, and that Loken had found a cure for the hunger that plagued him.\\n\\n Without conscious thought, he followed the warlock\u0027s scent across the city to a house located on a hill. A high wrought iron fence surrounded the yard. Lights shone in the windows. A plume of blue-gray smoke rose from a red brick chimney.\\n\\n Roshan stared up at the house for several minutes, men, lost in thought, he turned and headed for home.\\n\\n He had told Brenna to go to bed, but he found her curled up on the sofa in the living room, waiting for him. Morgana slept in the crook of her arm.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re up late,\" he said, dropping into the chair beside the sofa.\\n\\n \"I could not sleep. I kept thinking about Jimmy Dugan. Do you think he will take your advice and leave town?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s dead.\"\\n\\n Her eyes widened. \"Dead? How do you know?\"\\n\\n \"I saw his body.\"\\n\\n \"But… what happened? How did he die?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure, but Loken\u0027s draining the blood from the boy\u0027s body.\"\\n\\n Her face paled. For a moment, he thought she was going to be sick. \"You saw him?\"\\n\\n He nodded curtly.\\n\\n \"Poor Mr. Dugan. If only he had listened to you.\"\\n\\n Roshan grunted softly, surprised by his regret at the boy\u0027s death. Usually, the lives of others, especially mortals, meant little to him. He fed on them when necessary. Until Brenna entered his life, he had cared little for humanity\u0027s woes collectively or individually. But Jimmy Dugan hadn\u0027t been mortal. He had been a vampire, and though Roshan had scoffed at Jimmy\u0027s notion that they were brothers, he felt an uncharacteristic need to avenge the boy\u0027s death.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Brenna said, gathering Morgana in her arms, \"I think I will go to bed. Good night.\"\\n\\n \"Good night.\"\\n\\n He watched her leave the room, his gaze lingering on the sway of her hips. His little witch had changed his life in ways he had not imagined, made him yearn for things he had thought forever behind him. Now, looking at her, he found himself wanting to spend his life with her, to plant his seed within her, to watch her womb swell with new life.\\n\\n Simple dreams for a mortal man.\\n\\n Impossible dreams for a vampire.\\n\\n CHAPTER 17\\n\\n She was walking down the street outside the Wicca Way Coffee Shop and Bookstore when Anthony Loken fell into step beside her. Smiling, he took her hand in his and led her down the street. They walked until the city was far behind them. She frowned as they approached a large brick building. As they drew closer, she began to shiver as all her instincts warned her not to enter the building. The door was made of steel. The windows were boarded up on the inside and barred on the outside.\\n\\n She could smell death inside.\\n\\n With a cry, she tried to wrest her hand from Loken\u0027s, but his fingers tightened on hers as he dragged her inside the building and shut the door. Desperate to escape him, she tried to gather her will around her in order to repel his hold on her, but her magick was useless against him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-kiss-children-of-the-night-1/page-30.html","bookId":2299,"book":{"id":2299,"title":"Night\u0027s Kiss (Children of The Night #1)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Kiss (Children of The Night #1) \\n HE HAS FOUND HIS SOUL\u0027S DESIRE... \\n The Dark Gift has brought Roshan DeLongpre a lifetime of bitter loneliness-until, by chance, he comes across a picture of Brenna Flanagan.
