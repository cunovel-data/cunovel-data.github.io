{"id":93835,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"\"You killed her?\" Pain shadowed his eyes. \"I brought her across. She was my responsibility.\" Brenna stared at him, unblinking. Unbelieving. \"How could you?\" \"How could I not?\" She heard the anguish in his voice. \"I am truly sorry, Roshan. That must have been very difficult for you.\" \"Yes.\" \"You said she found no joy in the hunt. Do you?\" Her eyes were very wide and very green as she stared up at him, waiting for his answer. He loosed a heavy sigh, wishing she were not quite so curious, that her questions did not touch upon areas he would rather not discuss, facets of being a vampire that he would rather she didn\u0027t know. But he couldn\u0027t lie to her. \"I am a predator,\" he said candidly. \"We all enjoy the hunt.\" \"And killing?\" She grasped the edge of the book in her lap, her knuckles white. \"Do you enjoy that, as well?\" He stared back at her, wondering how best to answer such a question, wondering if the truth would drive her away. But he wanted no lies between them, not after last night. \"I\u0027ve killed in the past,\" he replied quietly. \"As a young vampire, it is very nearly impossible not to. The thrill of the hunt, the scent of fear rising from the prey, your own feeling of invincibility, it\u0027s a heady tiling, something you can\u0027t begin to understand unless you\u0027ve experienced it for yourself. And when you catch your quarry, and his blood is running hot from the chase, it\u0027s hard to remember that the puny mortal in your grasp is more than prey, hard to remember that once you were as weak and human as the creature trembling in your grasp.\" He looked down at her, his hunger rising at the images conjured by his words. Her scent filled his nostrils, reminding him of nights long ago, when it took more than a few sips to quench his thirst and ease the pain. But he had never killed any who were innocent or helpless, never preyed upon children, or those who were young and vulnerable. He took a deep, calming breath, then moved to stand in front of her. \"What the hell is this all about?\" She stared up at him. He looked very tall and forbidding standing there, his dark eyes focused on her face. \"Anthony Loken,\" she said. \"He is writing a book about vampires.\" \"You were with him today?\" He didn\u0027t need her to confirm it; he could smell the faint scent of the other man. He wondered that he hadn\u0027t noticed it before. \"I went to the bookstore, to look for a book about vampires. It was only when Myra told me I\u0027d probably have better luck at the library that I remembered how many books you have here.\" \"And where did you meet Loken?\" \"I did not \u0027meet\u0027 him. He arrived at the bookstore as I was leaving and insisted I have a cup of coffee with him.\" \"And you couldn\u0027t refuse?\" Her chin went up defiantly. \"At the time, I did not wish to.\" \"Why is he writing about vampires?\" \"He said they are fascinating creatures. He thinks that vampire blood might be a cure for some diseases, and that it might be a way to extend human life, or even conquer death.\" \"I see. And he wants to do this for the good of mankind?\" \"That is what he said, but I do not think he cares about anyone else. I think he wants only to find a way to live forever. He said he is looking for a vampire to help him with his research. That was why he was at the Nocturne last night.\" Remembering the young vampire in the club, Roshan swore softly, hoping the kid was smart enough to keep his identity a secret. Once made, most vampires seemed to know instinctively that it was to their best interests not to divulge their true nature. Of course, they also knew enough to stay out of another vampire\u0027s territory. Had Roshan been alone last night, he would have invited the young vampire to leave the city or face the consequences. Brenna looked at him a moment, then her eyes widened. \"Do you think Loken knows about the other vampire? Do you think he wants to use him for some kind of research?\" \"He was the only other vampire in the place.\" \"Loken asked me about you,\" she said, looking worried. \"Do you think he knows what you are?\" \"No.\" \"We must warn the other vampire,\" Brenna said earnestly, \"before it is too late.\" \"It might already be too late.\" \"Then we must go to the Nocturne now, tonight.\" She rose, the book in her lap falling to the floor. \"Hurry!\" There were only a few other customers at the Nocturne when they arrived. One couple sat at the bar talking to the bartender, another couple sat at one of the tables, intent only on each other. The young vampire sat at a booth in the far corner. His hair was dark brown, as were his eyes. His lips were thin, his nose was crooked. He was perhaps medium height, with the lean physique of a runner. He held a drink cradled in his hands. A sniff told Roshan it wasn\u0027t wine. The young vampire sensed the presence of another as soon as they entered the club. He looked up, his eyes narrowing as he focused on Roshan. Lifting his glass, he took a long swallow, regarding Roshan over the rim. Roshan slid into the booth across from the young vampire. Brenna sat beside Roshan, her hands folded in her lap. \"What do you want?\" the young vampire asked sullenly, his gaze darting from Roshan to Brenna and back again. \"I might ask you the same question,\" Roshan replied quietly. \"What do you mean?\" \"This is my city. What are you doing here?\" \"Hey, man, I didn\u0027t know you were here.\" \"Now you know. Who are you?\" \"Jimmy Dugan.\" \"Where are you from?\" \"I was born in Florida. That\u0027s where I was made.\" \"Who brought you across?\" \"Mara.\" Roshan grunted softly. He had never met Mara, but her name was legendary among vampires. Had their kind a queen, Mara would have worn the crown. \"Why are you here?\" Dugan stared into his glass. \"I wanted to get as far away from home as I could.\" \"How long have you been one of us?\" \"Just a few months.\" Roshan nodded. \"Do you know a man named Loken?\" Dugan looked up. \"Sure, I met him here last night. Why?\" \"Don\u0027t trust him,\" Roshan said bluntly. \"And get out of my city.\" \"Wait! I\u0027m supposed to meet him here later tonight.\" \"If you\u0027re smart, you\u0027ll be gone before he gets here.\" Roshan glanced at Brenna. \"Let\u0027s go.\" She slid out of the booth, and he followed her. \"Wait!\" Dugan called, a note of panic in his voice. \"I need help.\" \"Indeed?\" \"There\u0027s so much I don\u0027t know. Mara, she didn\u0027t tell me hardly anything.\" \"Then ask her for help.\" \"Dammit, man, you can\u0027t just turn your back on me. We\u0027re… we\u0027re brothers.\" \"No,\" Roshan replied coldly. \"We are enemies. And you are in my territory.\" \"I don\u0027t want this life!\" \"Then end it.\" \"Roshan.\" Brenna placed her hand on his arm. \"He needs your help. Remember how it was for you?\" He glared at her a moment, and then relented. \"Come with me, Dugan.\" Roshan didn\u0027t wait for a reply, didn\u0027t wait to see if the young vampire followed him. Taking Brenna by the hand, Roshan left the club. CHAPTER 15 Jimmy Dugan grabbed his jacket and hurried after the vampire and his woman. He had known Roshan was one of the undead the moment the man stepped into the Nocturne. He had felt it in the deepest part of him. But the woman… she puzzled him. She wasn\u0027t a vampire and yet he had sensed there was something different about her, a subtle hint of supernatural power that was similar to, but not quite as strong as, the power he had sensed in the warlock who had approached him last night. Was she also a witch? His pace slowed as he stepped out onto the sidewalk. Was he making another mistake? How did he know he could trust Roshan? Trusting people was what had gotten him into this mess in the first place. His mother had always warned him that he was too gullible, that he saw good in everyone. Lord, if she could see him now! She had cried when he called her last night. She had begged him to come home, promised to help him out of whatever trouble he was in. But how could he go back? He didn\u0027t trust himself to be around those he loved, not now, when the lust for blood was so strong, when he didn\u0027t know his own strength. He had spent one night with a beautiful woman and it had cost him his family, his job, and his girl. Damn! He didn\u0027t want to be a vampire. He had gone to the Nocturne in hopes of finding a way to regain his humanity. What good was living forever if you couldn\u0027t live with the people you loved the most? He glanced up and down the street, his preternatural senses pointing him in Roshan\u0027s direction. He found the vampire standing in the parking lot beside a sleek black Ferrari. The woman was already in the car. She looked at him through the window with a reassuring smile. \"Where\u0027s your car?\" the vampire asked. \"Over there,\" Jimmy said, pointing at a silver Intrepid. \"Follow me.\" \"Where are we going?\" Jimmy asked, but the other vampire didn\u0027t answer. Moving to the driver\u0027s side of the Ferrari, the vampire opened the door and slid behind the wheel. A moment later, the engine purred to life. With an exasperated sigh, Jimmy hurried to his car, certain the vampire wouldn\u0027t wait for him to catch up. He followed the Ferrari for about forty minutes before the vampire pulled off the road. Jimmy pulled up behind the other car, his gaze darting right and left. They were in a rest area located at the south end of the city limits. He grunted with wry amusement, drinking he felt like some young gunslinger being escorted out of Dodge. \"There\u0027s nothing to be afraid of,\" Jimmy muttered as he got out of the car. \"You\u0027re a vampire, for crying out loud!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-kiss-children-of-the-night-1/page-28.html","bookId":2299,"book":{"id":2299,"title":"Night\u0027s Kiss (Children of The Night #1)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Kiss (Children of The Night #1) HE HAS FOUND HIS SOUL\u0027S DESIRE...
