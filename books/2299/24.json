They never complain?\"\\n\\n \"They never remember.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"I wipe the memory from their minds when I\u0027m done.\"\\n\\n Brenna shook her head. \"So, you are a vampire, a sorcerer, and a hypnotist, as well?\"\\n\\n \"Just a vampire.\"\\n\\n She looked at him for a moment and then, to his surprise, she began to giggle.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s so funny?\"\\n\\n \"Just a vampire? Just a vampire?\" Her giggles turned to full-blown laughter. \"You say it as if it is so… so… ordinary.\" Her laughter trailed off as she lifted a hand to her neck.\\n\\n Roshan went suddenly still, his gaze following the movement of her hand, watching as her fingers probed the skin behind her ear. The scent of her blood, flowing like a crimson river through her veins, filled his nostrils; the sound of her heartbeat echoed in his ears. The hunger stirred within him.\\n\\n \"Have you taken blood from me before and wiped the memory from my mind?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" But now that she had planted the idea in his mind, he wondered if he would be able to resist doing just that. \"You were going to go and change your clothes,\" he reminded her, his voice ragged. \"Do it now.\"\\n\\n She stared at him a moment. Whatever she saw in his face drove her to her feet and out of the room.\\n\\n Upstairs, Brenna locked the door, even though she knew it would not keep him out. For a moment, she stood in the middle of the room, her heart pounding. How could she have been so foolish? She should have known better than to bring up the subject of how he fed, should have known it would arouse his hunger. But he had discussed it so calmly, and she couldn\u0027t deny being fascinated by it, and by him. Worse, she had almost asked him to drink from her again. What was the matter with her, that she was curious about such a repulsive act?\\n\\n Her stomach growled again, reminding her that she was supposed to be changing her clothes to go out to dinner with Roshan. That was what he was doing now, she thought with morbid humor, going out to dinner. Who did he prey upon? How did he decide?\\n\\n Putting the thought from her mind, she went to the closet and opened the door. She stood there a minute, trying to decide what to wear, and finally settled on a gauzy white blouse with a scoop neck and full sleeves, and a white skirt that was longer in the back than in the front. She wished there were a full-length mirror in the room so she could see how she looked. Perhaps the next time she went out, she would buy one. Perhaps Roshan would not mind. She wondered what it was like for him to look into a mirror and not see his image reflected back. She tried to imagine how she would feel in his place. Would it make her feel as if she didn\u0027t exist? Was that how it affected Roshan? Was that why there were no mirrors in the house?\\n\\n Sitting on the edge of the bed, she pulled on a pair of silky nylons and a pair of high-heeled white boots. She had never worn shoes or boots with such high heels and she wobbled a little as she walked into the bathroom to brush her hair.\\n\\n Forty minutes later, she heard Roshan\u0027s knock on the door. He whistled softly when he saw her, chasing away any doubts she might have had about how she looked.\\n\\n He took her to dinner at a quiet restaurant located in an upscale neighborhood.\\n\\n Brenna glanced at her surroundings, marveling at the plush carpets, the beautiful paintings on the walls, the abundance of greenery, the distinct lack of mirrors.\\n\\n Moments later, they were seated at a cozy table in a secluded corner near the back. The table was covered with a dark blue cloth. A small vase held three red roses.\\n\\n Sitting across from Roshan, she opened the menu, and then she glanced at him. \"I thought you did not eat… food?\"\\n\\n He glanced briefly at her neck. \"I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Wordlessly, she turned back to the menu. \"I cannot decide what to have.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re on your own.\" It had been centuries since he\u0027d dined on anything but a warm liquid diet.\\n\\n When the waitress returned, Brenna ordered prime rib. Roshan ordered a bottle of red wine.\\n\\n \"If you can\u0027t eat food, how can you drink wine?\" Brenna asked.\\n\\n He shrugged. \"A few sips is all I can tolerate.\"\\n\\n \"What happens when you eat?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to know.\" He had tried to eat a slice of brown bread smeared with butter and honey shortly after he had been made vampire. It had made him violently ill. He had not eaten solid food since, though there had been times when he had been tempted to try again. But that had been long ago. The thought of food no longer held any appeal. \"So, what did you do today, besides go to the bookstore?\"\\n\\n \"I began making a new wand, to replace the one I left behind. I cut a branch from one of the trees in the yard. I hope you do not mind.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. Take anything you need.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n He sipped from his glass now and then while she ate, Brenna felt guilty for eating in front of him, and even more guilty for enjoying the meal. She couldn\u0027t believe he never tired of drinking blood. Even if he found it palatable, as he had claimed earlier, to dine on the same thing every night must surely grow tiresome after the first hundred years! As much as she loved chocolate malts, she wouldn\u0027t want to have to subsist on chocolate malts and nothing else for the rest of her life.\\n\\n It was still raining when they left the restaurant Brenna lifted her face to the rain and licked the drops from her lips. Had she been back home, she would have shed her clothes and danced naked in the downpour.\\n\\n Roshan helped her into the car, then slid behind the wheel. Moments later they were driving through the rain, the only sound the swish-swish of the windshield wipers and an occasional clap of thunder.\\n\\n A short time later, he pulled into the driveway of his favorite Goth hangout, a small dance club called the Nocturne. A valet clad in a black suit and hooded cloak handed Brenna out of the car, then Roshan was there, taking her hand in his. They walked under a black canopy, then down a flight of stairs that led to a door that was carved with runes and magical creatures.\\n\\n He opened the door for her and followed her inside.\\n\\n The place was crowded even though it was after ten o\u0027clock in the middle of the week. Brenna glanced around, her eyes wide as she took it all in. The first thing she noticed was that she was the only one not wearing black. Masks of all kinds decorated the walls, from voodoo masks to ancient Indian burial masks. Black candles flickered in wrought iron sconces, casting eerie shadows over the faces of the crowd. It was rather frightening, being in the midst of so many men and women clad in black. Most of them had black hair; a good number wore cloaks or capes with hoods. A woman at the bar laughed out loud, displaying shiny white fangs. Brenna couldn\u0027t help staring at the couples dancing on the floor, their bodies pressed close together as they swayed back and forth, their movements slow and sensual.\\n\\n \"Are all these people vampires?\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"No, they\u0027re just pretending,\" he replied. \"All but that small dark-haired guy in the corner.\"\\n\\n \"What about that girl over there? She has fangs.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re fake.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know?\"\\n\\n \"I just know.\"\\n\\n Roshan found a table in the corner and he ordered drinks, a strawberry daiquiri for Brenna, wine for himself.\\n\\n \"Do you come here often?\" she asked.\\n\\n He nodded. \"I can be myself here. No one suspects my true nature. Here, I\u0027m just another wanna-be vampire playing a role. Come,\" he said, \"let\u0027s dance.\"\\n\\n She shook her head but he paid her no mind. Taking her by the hand, he led her onto the dance floor.\\n\\n \"I cannot,\" she said, glancing at the other couples. She tried to pull her hand from his, but to no avail.\\n\\n \"Trust me,\" he said, and drew her into his arms.\\n\\n Never before had she danced with a man. Never before had she realized how pleasurable it could be. Though she didn\u0027t know any of the steps, Roshan held her so closely she had no trouble following his lead. The music seeped into her, a low, steady beat that echoed the beat of her heart, a slow, sensual rhythm that made her think of the heated kisses she had shared with Roshan earlier. His arm was strong and sure around her waist; his body brushed against hers as they moved in a slow circle around the dance floor. The other couples faded into the distance until she was aware of nothing but the music and the tall, dark man holding her in his arms. His lips moved in her hair, his breath fanned her cheek. She risked a glance at his face and saw her own need mirrored in the depths of his eyes.\\n\\n In her time, there had been those who considered dancing a sin, a prelude to all manner of lasciviousness. Being in Roshan\u0027s arms, swaying back and forth, she was all too aware of his body against hers, of the sensual heat that flowed between them.\\n\\n He met her gaze, his deep blue eyes almost hypnotic in their intensity. She could see nothing but him, wanted no one but him. She leaned into him, feeling as though she was being drawn into his very soul.\\n\\n She reminded herself that he was a vampire, that there was no way they could have a life together, and that even though she was attracted to him like no other, it would never work, but somehow, with his arms around her, none of that seemed to matter.\\n\\n It took her a moment to realize the music had ended. Roshan smiled down at her, the affection in his eyes warming her clear to her toes.\\n\\n The music changed, becoming hard and fast. Taking her by the hand, Roshan led her off the dance floor.\\n\\n They were on their way back to their table when someone called her name.\\n\\n \"Brenna Flanagan, is that you?\"\\n\\n Glancing over her shoulder, she saw Anthony Loken striding toward her. Roshan\u0027s hand tightened on hers as his steps slowed, stopped.\\n\\n \"Good evening, Mr. Loken,\" she said politely.\\n\\n \"Anthony,\" he reminded her with a smile. \"It\u0027s wonderful to see you again.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" She looked up at Roshan. \"This is the man I told you about, remember?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes, I remember,\" Roshan said, his voice cool.\\n\\n Loken stuck his hand out. \"You must be the competition,\" he said, grinning good-naturedly. \"It\u0027s nice to meet you.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-kiss-children-of-the-night-1/page-24.html","bookId":2299,"book":{"id":2299,"title":"Night\u0027s Kiss (Children of The Night #1)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Kiss (Children of The Night #1) \\n HE HAS FOUND HIS SOUL\u0027S DESIRE... \\n The Dark Gift has brought Roshan DeLongpre a lifetime of bitter loneliness-until, by chance, he comes across a picture of Brenna Flanagan.
