{"id":75163,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"\"There\u0027s coffee on the stove, Tuck.\" Burke yawned over his bowl of raisin bran. \"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve seen you up and around this early in twenty years.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to catch you before you went into your office.\"\\n\\n \"My office.\" Burke\u0027s lips twisted into a grimace as he held out his morning mug so that Tucker could top it up with hot coffee. \"Don\u0027t you mean Burns\u0027s office? My butt hasn\u0027t felt the seat of my own chair in three days.\"\\n\\n \"Is he getting anywhere, or is he just blowing smoke?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s generated more paperwork than the Bank of England. Faxes, Federal Express packages, conference calls to Washington, D.C. We got us a bulletin board with pictures of all the victims tacked to it. Vital statistics, time and place of death. He\u0027s got stuff referenced and cross-referenced till your head spins.\"\\n\\n Tucker sat down. \"You\u0027re not telling me anything, Burke.\"\\n\\n Burke met Tucker\u0027s gaze. \"There\u0027s not much I\u0027m free to tell you. We\u0027ve got a list of suspects.\"\\n\\n Nodding, Tucker took a sip of coffee. \"Am I still on it?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got an alibi for Edda Lou.\" Burke took a spoonful of cereal, hesitated, then set it down again. \"I guess you know Burns has taken a real dislike to you. He doesn\u0027t think much of your sister saying you were up playing cards with her half the night.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not too worried about that.\"\\n\\n \"You should be.\" Burke broke off when he heard someone moving around in the living room. A moment later the Looney Tunes theme warbled from the television. \"Eight o\u0027clock,\" he said with a smile. \"That kid\u0027s got it down to a science.\" He picked up his coffee. \"I\u0027ll tell you this, Tuck. Burns would like nothing better than to hang this whole thing around your neck. He won\u0027t do anything that\u0027s not straight and legal, but if he can find a way to reel you in, it would give him a lot of pleasure.\"\\n\\n \"What we got here\u0027s a personality clash,\" Tucker said with a thin smile. \"They got a time of death on Darleen yet?\"\\n\\n \"Teddy\u0027s putting it at between nine p.m. and midnight.\"\\n\\n \"Since I was with Caroline from about nine on, the night Darleen was killed, that ought to ease me out of the running.\"\\n\\n \"With a series of murders like this, it\u0027s not just a matter of motive and opportunity. He\u0027s got a head doctor who worked up a psychiatric profile. We\u0027re looking for someone with a grudge against women-especially women who might be a bit free with their favors. Someone who knew each victim well enough to get them alone.\"\\n\\n Burke\u0027s flakes were getting soggy. He scooped them up more for fuel than enjoyment. \"Darleen\u0027s a puzzle,\" he went on. \"Maybe it was just chance that he came across her on the road that way. Could have been impulse. But chance and impulse don\u0027t follow the pattern.\"\\n\\n Tucker let that settle for a minute. There was a pattern, he mused, but he didn\u0027t think anybody had put all the lines and checks together just yet. \"I want to get back to that psychiatric stuff. You\u0027ve got somebody with a grudge against women-maybe because they hated their mama, or some woman let them down along the way.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the idea.\"\\n\\n \"Before Darleen, you\u0027d pretty well settled on Austin.\"\\n\\n \"He fit the profile,\" Burke agreed. \"And after he went after Caroline with a buck knife, it looked rock solid.\"\\n\\n \"But unless Austin came back from the dead, he couldn\u0027t have killed Darleen.\" Tucker shifted in his chair. \"What do you think about heredity, Burke? About blood and genes and bad seeds?\"\\n\\n \"Anybody with kids thinks about it some. Anybody with parents, I should say,\" he added, and shoved his bowl aside. \"I spent a lot of years wondering if I\u0027d make all the wrong moves the way my father did, push myself into corners or let myself get pushed there, like him.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I should have thought before I asked.\"\\n\\n \"No, it was a long time ago. Almost twenty years now. It\u0027s better to look to your own kids. That one out there.\" He pointed a spoon toward the living room, where his youngest watched Bugs outwit Elmer Fudd. \"He looks like me. I got pictures of myself at his age, and it\u0027s almost spooky how much he looks like me.\"\\n\\n \"Vernon favors his daddy,\" Tucker said. He waited while Burke set his spoon aside. \"It can go deeper than coloring and the shape of a nose, Burke. It can go to personality and tendencies, gestures, habits. I\u0027ve had reason to think on this because of my own family.\" It was something he didn\u0027t like to talk about, not even with Burke. \"Dwayne\u0027s got the same sickness that killed our father. Maybe he\u0027s got a better disposition, but it\u0027s there, rooted inside. All I have to do is look in the mirror, or at Dwayne and Josie, and I see our mother. She\u0027s stamped right on our faces. And she had a love of books, poetry especially. I got that, too. I didn\u0027t ask for it, it\u0027s just there.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t argue that. Marvella\u0027s got a way of tilting her head the same way, the same angle as Susie does.\\n\\n And she\u0027s got Susie\u0027s stubborn streak-\u0027I want it and I\u0027ll find a way to get it.\u0027 We pass things on, good and bad, whether we aim to or not.\"\\n\\n \"Vernon\u0027s not gentle with his wife, any more than Austin was gentle with his.\"\\n\\n \"What brought this on, Tucker?\"\\n\\n \"You heard about the ruckus at the carnival last night?\"\\n\\n \"That young Cy bloodied his brother\u0027s nose? Marvella and Bobby Lee were there. Nobody thought it was a shame.\"\\n\\n \"Vernon\u0027s not a popular man. His daddy wasn\u0027t either. They\u0027ve got the same look about them, in the eyes, Burke.\" Tucker kicked back in the chair to stretch his legs. \"My mama bought me this picture book once. A Bible stories book. I remember this one picture. It was of Isaiah or Ezekiel or somebody. One of those prophets who strolled off into the wasteland for forty days to fast and meet the Lord? This was supposed to be a picture of him after he came back spouting prophesies and speaking in tongues. Whatever the hell they did when they\u0027d cooked their brains in the desert. He had this look in his eyes, this wild, rolling look like a weasel gets when he smells chicken feathers. I always wondered why the Lord chose to speak through crazy people. I expect it was because they wouldn\u0027t question whatever voice they heard inside their head. Seems to me they might hear something else inside there, too. Something not so full of light and good will.\"\\n\\n Saying nothing, Burke rose to pour more coffee. Burns had said something about voices. About how some serial killers claim to have been told what to do and how to do it. The Son of Sam had claimed his neighbor\u0027s dog had ordered him to kill.\\n\\n For himself, Burke didn\u0027t go in for the mystical. He figured David Berkowitz had juggled psychiatry against the law to cop an insanity plea. But Tucker\u0027s theory made him uneasy.\\n\\n \"Are you trying to tell me you think Vernon hears voices?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s inside his head, but I know what I saw in his eyes last night. The same thing I saw in Austin\u0027s when he was choking me and calling me by my father\u0027s name. That prophet look. If he could have broken Cy in two, he would\u0027ve done it. And I\u0027d stake Sweetwater against the fact that he\u0027d have considered it holy work.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that he had more than a passing acquaintance with any of the victims other than Edda Lou.\"\\n\\n \"This is Innocence. Nobody gets through their life without knowing what there is to know about everybody else. What\u0027s that saying about the apple not falling far from the tree? If Austin had it in him to kill, his son might have the same.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll talk to him.\"\\n\\n Satisfied, Tucker nodded. When the phone rang, they both ignored it. From upstairs, Susie answered it on the second ring. \"You\u0027re going to be at Sweetwater tonight, for the fireworks?\"\\n\\n \"Unless I want my wife and kids to leave me.\"\\n\\n \"Carl, too?\"\\n\\n \"No reason for him to stay in town when everybody\u0027ll be out at your place. Why?\"\\n\\n Tucker moved his shoulders restlessly. \"A lot of people, a lot of noise and confusion. I\u0027m worried, especially about Josie and Caroline. I\u0027d feel better knowing you and Carl are close.\"\\n\\n \"Burke.\" Susie came in. She was still in her robe, smelling of her shower with carnation-scented soap. Studying her, Burke thought she looked no more than twenty.\\n\\n \"Was that the office?\" he asked her.\\n\\n \"No, it was Delia.\" She laid her hand over Tucker\u0027s. \"Matthew Burns had Dwayne brought in for questioning.\"\\n\\n If he hadn\u0027t been so infuriated, Tucker would have been amused. The idea of Dwayne, soft-hearted, bleary-eyed Dwayne, as a murder suspect was certainly laughable. The fact that his brother had been yanked out of bed and driven into town to be questioned by some smug-faced FBI agent was not.\\n\\n Struggling with his temper, Tucker walked into the sheriff\u0027s office with Burke. He wouldn\u0027t lose it, he promised himself. It would suit Burns too well to kick him out. Instead, he flipped his brother a cigarette, then lighted one for himself.\\n\\n \"You getting an early start today, Burns,\" Tucker said mildly. \"Guess you forgot today\u0027s a national holiday.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m aware of the date.\" Burns stretched his legs behind Burke\u0027s desk and kept his hands folded on top. \"I\u0027m also aware that you have a parade scheduled for noon. My business won\u0027t interfere with your town\u0027s celebrations. Sheriff, I\u0027m told you\u0027ll be blocking off the main drag by ten.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like my car moved where I\u0027ll be able to get in and out of town as necessary.\" Taking out his keys, he set them on the edge of the desk.\\n\\n Carl saw the flare in Burke\u0027s eyes and stepped forward. \"I\u0027ll move it on down to Magnolia.\" Jingling the keys in his hand, he stopped by Tucker. \"I\u0027m sorry, Tuck. I had orders to bring him in.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right, Carl. It shouldn\u0027t take long to straighten this out. Heard your girl\u0027s going to be twirling today.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s been practicing day and night. Her grand-pappy bought one of those video recorders so he can shoot her whole routine as she marches.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s fascinating, Deputy,\" Burns put in, \"but we have business to conduct here.\" His gaze shifted to Tucker. \"Official business.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be sure to watch for her myself, Carl,\" Tucker said. He waited until the deputy went out before taking another drag. \"Dwayne, did they read you your rights?\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Longstreet isn\u0027t under arrest. Yet,\" Burns interrupted. \"He\u0027s merely being questioned.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got a right to a lawyer, doesn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"Naturally.\" Burns spread his hands. \"If you\u0027re concerned that your rights might be abused, Mr. Longstreet, or that you may incriminate yourself, please feel free to call your attorney. We\u0027ll be happy to wait.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d just as soon get it done.\" Dwayne looked miserably at Tucker. \"Sure could use some coffee, though, and a bottle of aspirin.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll fix you up.\" Burke patted his shoulder as he walked into the bathroom.\\n\\n \"This is official business, Longstreet.\" Burns inclined his head in dismissal. \"You have no place here.\"\\n\\n \"Burke deputized me.\" Tucker\u0027s lips spread in a slow smile. Though Burke paused, lifting his brows as he came back in with the aspirin, he said nothing to contradict the statement. \"He can always use some extra help on the Fourth.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the truth,\" Burke commented as he shook tablets from the plastic bottle. \"And seeing as my youngest has a birthday today on top of it, I\u0027d be obliged if we could get things moving.\"\\n\\n \"Very well.\" Burns punched in his recorder. \"Mr. Longstreet, you reside at the property known as Sweetwater, in the county of Bolivar, Mississippi?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\" Dwayne accepted the mug of coffee and the aspirin. \"The Longstreets have been at Sweetwater nearly two hundred years.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" History and family legacies didn\u0027t interest Burns. \"You live there with your brother and your sister.\"\\n\\n \"And Delia. She\u0027s been housekeeper at Sweetwater for more than thirty years. And right now Cousin Lulu\u0027s visiting.\" Dwayne singed his tongue with the hot coffee, but the aspirin went down. \"She\u0027s a cousin on my mama\u0027s side. No telling how long she\u0027ll stay. Cousin Lulu\u0027s been coming and going as she pleases as long as anyone can remember. I recollect once-\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027ll save the home-boy routine,\" Burns said, \"I\u0027d like to finish before the brass bands and batons.\"\\n\\n Dwayne caught Tucker\u0027s grin and shrugged. \"Just answering your question. Oh, and we\u0027ve got Cy and Caroline with us now, too. That what you want to know?\"\\n\\n \"Your marital status?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m divorced. Two years come October. That\u0027s when the papers came through, wasn\u0027t it, Tucker?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"And your ex-wife now lives where?\"\\n\\n \"Up in Nashville. Rosebank Avenue. She\u0027s got a nice little house there, close enough to school that the boys can walk.\"\\n\\n \"And she is the former Adalaide Koons?\"\\n\\n \"Sissy,\" Dwayne corrected him. \"Her little brother never could say Adalaide, so she was Sissy.\"\\n\\n \"And Mrs. Longstreet was pregnant with your first son when you married?\"\\n\\n Dwayne frowned into his coffee. \"I don\u0027t see that it\u0027s any of your business, but it\u0027s no secret, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"You married her to give the child a name.\"\\n\\n \"We got married \u0027cause we figured it was best.\"\\n\\n With a murmur of agreement, Burns steepled his hands. \"And shortly after the birth of your second child, you wife left you.\"\\n\\n Dwayne drained his coffee. Over the rim, his bloodshot eyes hardened. \"That\u0027s no secret either.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll agree it was an unpleasant scene?\" Burns shifted forward to read some notes. \"Your wife locked you out of the house after a violent argument-I believe you\u0027d been drinking heavily-and threw your belongings out of an upstairs window. She then took your children to Nashville, where she took up residence with a shoe salesman who moonlighted as a musician.\"\\n\\n Dwayne examined the cigarette Tucker had tossed him. \"I guess that\u0027s about right.\"\\n\\n \"How did it make you feel, Mr. Longstreet, when the woman you had married under duress left you, taking your children, and turned to a second-rate guitar player?\"\\n\\n Dwayne took his time lighting the cigarette. \"I guess she had to do what suited her best.\"\\n\\n \"So you were amenable to the situation?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t try to stop her, if that\u0027s what you mean. Didn\u0027t seem like I was much good at being married anyway.\"\\n\\n \"The divorce suit she filed against you accused you of emotional cruelty, violence, erratic and unstable behavior, and stated you were a physical risk to both her and your children. Did that seem harsh?\"\\n\\n Dwayne dragged deep on tobacco and wished desperately for whiskey. \"I expect she was feeling harsh. I can\u0027t say I did right by her, or the boys either.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to do this, Dwayne.\" When his control broke, Tucker stepped forward to take his brother\u0027s arm. \"You don\u0027t have to answer this fucker\u0027s questions about a marriage that\u0027s over, or your feelings about it.\"\\n\\n Burns inclined his head. \"Is there a reason your brother shouldn\u0027t confirm what I already know?\"\\n\\n Tucker let go of Dwayne to slap his hands on the desk. \"I can\u0027t think of one. Just like I can\u0027t think of a reason I shouldn\u0027t kick your skinny butt all the way back to D.C.\"\\n\\n \"We can discuss that on our own time, Longstreet. Right now you\u0027re interfering with a federal investigation. If you persist, you\u0027ll do your complaining from one of those cells.\"\\n\\n Tucker grabbed Burns\u0027s pinstriped tie and yanked upward. \"Why don\u0027t I show you how we handle things down here in the delta?\"\\n\\n \"Leave him alone.\" Dwayne stirred himself to snag Tucker\u0027s wrist.\\n\\n \"The hell I will.\"\\n\\n \"I said leave him alone.\" Dwayne stuck his face close to Tucker\u0027s. \"I\u0027ve got nothing to hide. This Yankee sonofabitch can ask questions from now to doomsday and that won\u0027t change. Leave him be so we can get it done.\"\\n\\n Reluctantly, Tucker loosened his grip. \"We\u0027re going to finish this, you and me.\"\\n\\n Stone-faced, Burns straightened his tie. \"It\u0027ll be a pleasure.\" He remained standing, turning to the bulletin board at his back. \"Mr. Longstreet, were you acquainted with Arnette Gantrey?\" Burns tapped a finger against the space between a photo of a smiling blond woman and a black-and-white police photo taken at Gooseneck Creek.\\n\\n \"I knew Arnette. We went to school together, dated a few times.\"\\n\\n \"And Francie Logan?\" Burns slid his finger to the next set of photos.\\n\\n \"I knew Francie.\" Dwayne averted his eyes. \"Everybody knew Francie. She grew up here. Lived in Jackson for a while, then came back after getting divorced.\"\\n\\n \"And you were acquainted with Edda Lou Hatinger?\"\\n\\n Dwayne forced himself to look back, but focused on the tip of Burns\u0027s finger. \"Yeah. I knew Darleen, too, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re getting at.\"\\n\\n \"Did you know a woman named Barbara Kinsdale?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Dwayne\u0027s brow creased as he tried out the name in his head. \"Nobody around here named Kinsdale.\"\\n\\n \"Are you quite sure?\" Burns unpinned a photo from the board. \"Take a look.\"\\n\\n Dwayne picked up the photo from the desk, grateful it was a shot of a live woman. She was a pretty brunette, perhaps thirty, with straight hair sweeping slight shoulders. \"I\u0027ve never seen her before.\"\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t you?\" Burns picked up his notes. \"Barbara Kinsdale, five foot two, a hundred three pounds, brown hair, blue eyes. Age thirty-one. Does that description sound familiar?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say.\"\\n\\n \"You should be able to say,\" Burns continued. \"It\u0027s almost a perfect description of your ex-wife. Mrs. Kinsdale was a cocktail waitress at the Stars and Bars Club in Nashville. Residence 3043 Eastland Avenue. That\u0027s about three blocks away from your ex-wife\u0027s home. Emmett Cotrain, your ex-wife\u0027s fiance, performed at the Stars and bars on weekends. An interesting coincidence, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n A thin bead of sweat dripped down Dwayne\u0027s back. \"I guess it is.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s more interesting that Mrs. Kinsdale was found floating in the Percy Priest Lake, outside of Nashville, late this spring. She was naked, her throat had been slit, and her body mutilated.\"\\n\\n Burns tossed another photo across the desk, but in this one, Barbara Kinsdale was very dead. \"Where were you on the night of May 22 of this year, Mr. Longstreet?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Jesus.\" Dwayne shut his eyes. The body hadn\u0027t been covered in the police shot, but had been laid out, gray and tortured, for the cold camera lens.\\n\\n \"I should tell you that my information places you in Nashville from the twenty-first to the twenty-third.\"\\n\\n \"I took my boys to the zoo.\" Dwayne rubbed shaking hands over his eyes. It did look like Sissy. God almighty, especially dead it looked like Sissy. \"I took them to the zoo and to a pizza parlor. They stayed with me at the hotel.\"\\n\\n \"On the night of the twenty-second you were seen in the hotel bar at approximately ten-thirty. Your children weren\u0027t with you.\"\\n\\n \"They were asleep. I left them in the room and went down and had a drink. Couple drinks,\" he said with a sigh. \"Sissy\u0027d been on me about doing more for them, and wanting a bigger house once she and the guy she was with got married. I didn\u0027t have more than two drinks because I didn\u0027t want to forget the boys were asleep upstairs.\"\\n\\n \"And didn\u0027t you call your wife from the bar just before midnight?\" Burns continued. \"You argued with her, threatened her.\"\\n\\n \"I called her. I was sitting there in the room while the boys slept. My boys. It didn\u0027t seem right that I was to help her buy a new house so she could live in it with another man my sons would think of as a father.\" Pale, shaken, Dwayne looked over at Tucker. \"It wasn\u0027t the money.\"\\n\\n \"It was the humiliation,\" Burns suggested. \"The humiliation at the hands of a woman. She\u0027d already made you a laughingstock by locking you out of your own house, leaving you for another man. Now she was demanding more money so she could live a better life with that man.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t care who she lived with. It just didn\u0027t seem right-\"\\n\\n \"No, it didn\u0027t seem right,\" Burns agreed. \"So you told her there\u0027d be no more money, and that you\u0027d take her to court if she didn\u0027t watch her step. That you\u0027d pay her back.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what I said exactly.\"\\n\\n \"She does. Oh, despite your estrangement, she\u0027s loyal enough to add that you were always full of bluster when you\u0027d been drinking. She didn\u0027t take anything you said seriously, and went back to listen to the next set at the bar. Even stayed on after it closed, since she didn\u0027t have the boys to get home to. But Barbara Kinsdale left about two. She walked out into a deserted parking lot. A dark parking lot, where she was knocked unconscious and dragged to a waiting car. She was driven to the lake and slaughtered.\"\\n\\n Burns waited a beat. \"Do you own a knife, Mr. Longstreet? A long-bladed hunting knife?\"\\n\\n \"This is crazy.\" Dwayne dropped his hands into his lap. \"I didn\u0027t kill anybody.\"\\n\\n \"Where were you on the night of June thirtieth, between nine p.m. and midnight?\"\\n\\n \"For chrissakes.\" He stumbled to his feet. \"Burke, for chrissakes.\"\\n\\n \"I think he should have a lawyer.\" Strain had etched lines around Burke\u0027s mouth when he turned to Burns. \"I don\u0027t think he should answer any more questions without a lawyer.\"\\n\\n Well satisfied, Burns spread his hands. \"That\u0027s his right, of course.\"\\n\\n \"I was just driving around,\" Dwayne blurted out. \"It was raining and I didn\u0027t want to go home. I had a flask in the car and I just drove around.\"\\n\\n \"And on the night of June twelfth?\" Burns asked, working back to the night of Edda Lou\u0027s murder.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. How the fuck is a man supposed to remember where he is every night of the year?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t say anything else.\" Tucker stepped forward to take both of Dwayne\u0027s arms. \"Don\u0027t say anything. You hear me?\"\\n\\n \"Tucker, I didn\u0027t-you know I didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"I know. Be quiet.\" He turned to stand between Burns and his brother. \"Are you bringing charges?\"\\n\\n The holiday weekend had bogged down his paper-work. Not everyone was as dedicated to justice as Matthew Burns. \"I\u0027ll have a warrant within twenty-four hours.\"\\n\\n \"Fine. In the meantime you can fuck yourself. Let\u0027s get you home, Dwayne.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Longstreet,\" Burns rose with a nod to each brother. \"I\u0027d advise that neither of you think of leaving the area. The federal government has a very long arm.\"\\n\\n \"I need a drink.\"\\n\\n \"You need to keep a clear head,\" Tucker contradicted him, and punched Josie\u0027s car up to seventy. \"You stay clear of the bottle, Dwayne.\" He took his eyes off the road long enough to shoot his brother a warning. \"Until we get this mess straightened out, you stay clear. I mean it.\"\\n\\n \"They think I did it.\" Dwayne rubbed his hands over his face until he was afraid he\u0027d scrub off a layer of skin. \"They think I killed all those women, Tuck. Even the one I\u0027d never seen before. She looked like Sissy. Christ, she did look like Sissy.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to call our lawyer,\" Tucker said calmly even as his knuckles whitened on the wheel. \"And you\u0027re going to. keep your head clear so you can think back. Think back real carefully until you find out what you were doing, who you were with when Arnette, Francie, and Edda Lou were killed. One\u0027s all you need. One of those nights you had to be somewhere with somebody. They won\u0027t have a case then. They know it was the same person killed them all. You just have to think.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think I want to? Don\u0027t you think I\u0027m trying?\" Teeth gritted, Dwayne pounded his fists on the dash. \"Goddammit, you don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like once I start in drinking. I told you I forget things. I fucking blank out.\" Moaning, he dropped his head between his knees. \"I blank out, Tucker. Oh, God, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing when that happens. I could\u0027ve done it.\" Terrified, he squeezed his eyes tight. \"Jesus help me, I could\u0027ve killed them all and not even know.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s bullshit.\" Furious, Tucker swerved to the shoulder. Dwayne opened his runny eyes as the car jerked to a halt. He stared under the seat. Stared and stared until Tucker jerked him upright. \"That\u0027s fucking bullshit and I don\u0027t want to hear any more of it.\" He shoved Dwayne back, pushing his livid face into his brother\u0027s pale one. \"You didn\u0027t kill anybody, and you get that plain in your head right now. I got an idea who did.\"\\n\\n Dwayne swallowed. His head was reeling along with his stomach, but he tried to grip on to that one sentence. \"You know?\"\\n\\n \"I said I have an idea. I\u0027m going to check into it as soon as we call the lawyer and get him doing whatever the hell lawyers do.\" He kept his grip tight on Dwayne\u0027s shirt. \"Now, you listen to me. You\u0027re not going to go home and upset Delia and Josie and everybody with talk about this. You\u0027re going to hold on to yourself, you understand me? You\u0027re going to tough this out until it\u0027s fixed. If there was one thing the old man had right in his whole miserable ass-kicking life, it was that we\u0027ve got a responsibility to the family. We\u0027re going to stay whole, Dwayne.\"\\n\\n \"To the family,\" Dwayne repeated, and shuddered. \"I won\u0027t let you down.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\" He let Dwayne go, then sat back a minute to calm his jittery stomach. \"We\u0027ll show that Yankee bastard what Longstreets can do once they\u0027re riled. I\u0027ll call the governor. That ought to rattle Burns\u0027s cage a bit. We\u0027ll see how quick he gets his fucking warrant.\"\\n\\n \"I want to go home.\" Dwayne closed his eyes again when Tucker started the car. \"I\u0027ll be all right when I get home.\"\\n\\n A few minutes later they turned through the gates of Sweetwater. \"You just tell them Burns asked you a bunch of stupid questions and that\u0027s that,\" Tucker advised. \"Don\u0027t say anything about Sissy or that business in Nashville.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t.\" Dwayne stared at the house, white and lovely and graceful as a woman in the morning sunlight.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to figure it out, Tucker. And I\u0027ll fix it, like I used to.\"\\n\\n \"This time you let me do the fixing.\"\\n\\n As Tucker parked by the steps, Josie came out. She was still in her robe and her hair was tousled about the shoulders. It didn\u0027t take Tucker longer than ten seconds to measure her mood as dangerous. She strutted down the steps to greet them, slapping a hairbrush against her palm.\\n\\n \"Looks like I\u0027m going to have to start locking my car and taking my keys inside with me.\"\\n\\n With a shrug, Tucker pulled her keys out and tossed them to her. \"I had business in town. You were asleep.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll notice, Mr. Longstreet, it\u0027s my name on the registration of this vehicle. I don\u0027t appreciate you commandeering it whenever you have the whim.\" She poked the brush into his chest. \"It\u0027s common courtesy to ask for the use of someone else\u0027s property.\"\\n\\n \"I said you were asleep.\"\\n\\n Fluttering her lashes, she scanned the driveway. \"Mine is not the only car here.\"\\n\\n \"It was the first one I came to.\" He checked his temper and tried a smile. \"You sure did wake up on the wrong side of the bed, darling.\"\\n\\n She met charm with a haughty look. \"I might suggest you consider getting yourself alternate transportation until that toy of yours is repaired.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" He kissed her cheek. \"You sound just like Mama.\"\\n\\n Josie sniffed and stepped back. \"What are you staring at, Dwayne?\" Automatically, she fluffed at her hair, then her eyes changed. \"Why, honey, you look just awful. What\u0027ve you boys been up to so early?\"\\n\\n \"Just some business in town,\" Tucker repeated before Dwayne could answer. \"You\u0027d better get yourself prettied up if you\u0027re going to the parade.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Course I\u0027m going. The Longstreets never miss a Fourth of July parade. Dwayne, you come inside and get yourself something to eat. You\u0027re green around the gills.\"\\n\\n \"He hasn\u0027t recovered from the carnival.\"\\n\\n \"Aw.\" Instantly solicitous, Josie took her brother\u0027s arm. \"You go in and have Delia fix you up something. Cousin Lulu shouldn\u0027t have teased you into going on that Round-Up.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m all right.\" He put his arms around her, holding her close. \"Josie. It\u0027s going to be all right.\"\\n\\n \"Of course it is, honey.\" She patted his back. \"It\u0027s a fine day for a parade, and it\u0027ll be a finer night for fireworks. Go on now, so I can paint my face.\" She waved him inside, but held up a hand to stop Tucker. She forgot all about being annoyed with him. \"What\u0027s wrong with Dwayne?\"\\n\\n \"They had him in for questioning this morning.\"\\n\\n Her eyes lit. \"Dwayne?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll call us all in, I imagine. It\u0027s just standard.\"\\n\\n She began to tap the brush against her palm again. \"Why, I might have to give Matthew Burns a piece of my mind.\"\\n\\n \"Let it go, Jose. It\u0027s nothing to worry about. He\u0027ll feel better once we get this holiday started.\"\\n\\n \"All right, but I\u0027m going to keep an eye on him.\" She patted the keys in her pocket as she started into the house. \"Next time you ask, you hear?\" She passed Caroline in the doorway. \"You watch out for that one, Caro. He\u0027s a scoundrel.\"\\n\\n \"I already know.\" Caroline stepped out on the porch, then, to please herself, turned a showy circle. The skirt of her pale blue sundress swirled out, then settled softly around her legs.\\n\\n Tucker stayed on the step below and took her hands. The dress had flirty laces at the bodice and a back cut to the waist. \"You sure do look a picture.\"\\n\\n \"I heard I was going on a picnic after the parade.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a fact.\" He kissed the palm of her hand, then held it against his cheek a moment. They said you didn\u0027t know what you had until you\u0027d lost it. Tucker thought he\u0027d discovered something that was equally true. You didn\u0027t know what had been missing from your life until you found it. \"Caroline?\"\\n\\n She turned her hands to link her fingers with his. \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a lot of things to say to you.\" He moved up the steps until their mouths were level and the kiss could be sweet. \"I sure as hell hope you\u0027re ready to hear them when I do. Right now I\u0027ve got some business to see to. You mind riding to the parade with Delia? I\u0027ll meet you there.\"\\n\\n \"I could wait.\"\\n\\n He shook his head and kissed her again. \"I\u0027d rather you went on.\"\\n\\n \"All right, then. I\u0027ll pile in with Delia and Cy and Cousin Lulu-who\u0027s going to be the hit of the day. She\u0027s wearing trousers with the Confederate flag on one leg and the American flag on the other. The flag of the Revolution, I should say.\"\\n\\n \"You can always count on Cousin Lulu.\"\\n\\n \"Tucker.\" Caroline cupped his face in her hands. \"If you have trouble, I wish you\u0027d share it with me.\"\\n\\n \"I will soon enough. You look just right here, Caroline. Standing on the porch with your blue dress, the door open behind you and bees buzzing in the flowers. You look just right.\" He wrapped his arms around her, held her there a moment while he wished the world would stay like this, pretty and peaceful and as gracious as a lovely woman dressed in blue.\\n\\n \"You be ready for those fireworks tonight,\" he told her. \"And for what I want to say to you after.\" His arms tightened. \"Caroline, I want-\"\\n\\n \"God sakes,\" Lulu muttered from the doorway. \"Tucker, are you going to stand around all day smooching with that Yankee? We got to get on or we won\u0027t get a decent spot to watch the parade.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s time yet.\" But Tucker released Caroline. \"You keep an eye on this Yankee till I get there,\" he began, then his face split with a grin. \"I declare, Cousin Lulu, you look good enough to run up the flagpole. Where\u0027d you get those pants?\"\\n\\n \"Had \u0027em made special.\" She spread her scrawny, flag-bedecked legs. \"Got me a jacket to match, but it\u0027s too cursed hot to wear it.\" She stuck an eagle feather into her hair, where it drooped over one ear. \"I\u0027m ready to go.\"\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027d better get.\" He gave Caroline a quick kiss before heading inside. \"I\u0027ll send the others out. Cousin Lulu, you make sure Caroline doesn\u0027t go wandering off with some smooth talker.\"\\n\\n Lulu snorted. \"She\u0027s not about to go far.\"\\n\\n Caroline smiled. \"No, I\u0027m not.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence/page-28.html","bookId":2411,"book":{"id":2411,"title":"Carnal Innocence","description":"Storyline: In the small town of Innocence, Mississippi, days are long, nights are fragrant, and secrets are hard to keep. But when a brutal killer starts claiming the lives of the town\u0027s most attractive women, lifelong neighbors are forced to wonder if the culprit is a stranger lurking in the bayou...or someone right next door. \\n World-famous concert violinist Caroline Waverly knows nothing of the murders when she arrives in Innocence. Burned out from a childhood lost to endless rehearsals and an all-too-public breakup with the conductor who was her lover, Caroline is looking for a little peace and some time to think. She hopes that a stay at her late grandmother\u0027s house the one with a covered porch just made for soft summer nights will provide the tranquillity she needs. But Innocence has something else to offer Caroline: a man named Tucker Longstreet. \\n Blessed with the Longstreet good looks, lazy charm, and family fortune, Tucker is a tall, cool drink of water and he knows it. He likes to keep his romances short and shallow. But one look at Caroline, and Tucker realizes that she is unlike any other woman he\u0027s met. Tightly coiled and coolly reserved, Caroline is determined to fight him off. She might be able to do a better job if she hadn\u0027t felt an unexpected thrill at his ardent advances...and if she hadn\u0027t been so scared after finding a third murder victim in the murky waters behind her home. \\n For Caroline Waverly,a beautiful summer interlude could turn into much more or could stir a killer\u0027s crazed dreams.
