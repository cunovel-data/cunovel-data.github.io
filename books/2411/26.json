{"id":75161,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Caroline was used to restless nights. Over the past few years she\u0027d developed a grudging envy for people who could climb into bed, close their eyes, and slip effortlessly into sleep. Since settling in Innocence, she\u0027d come close to joining the ranks of those privileged dreamers. Now it seemed she was back at square one, facing long, dark hours in the frustrating pursuit of sleep.\n The tricks of the insomniac were routine to her. Hot baths, warm brandy, dull books. The first two relaxed her body, but when she tried reading, her mind kept drifting away from the words on paper. There was a television cleverly concealed in a cherrywood armoire, but none of the late night shows caught her interest or bored her enough to trick her brain into sleep.\n She couldn\u0027t complain about the heat, not here in the lovely cool of her room at Sweetwater. And she was used to strange rooms and strange beds. The one she\u0027d been given was as gracious as any she\u0027d found in the fine hotels of Europe. The bed was delicately feminine with its draping canopy and lacy pillows piled high. If that didn\u0027t seduce sleep, there was a plump daybed in misty blue satin that angled toward the french doors and offered a view of moonlight.\n Vases of flowers fresh from the garden sweetened the air. Charming watercolors were scattered over the warm rose-tinted walls. A lady\u0027s dressing table held elegant antique bottles that glistened in the lamplight. There was a small fireplace of blue stone that would provide warmth and comfort on chill winter nights. She could picture herself cuddled under thick handworked quilts on some windy February midnight, watching the flames crackle and shoot shadows up the walls.\n With Tucker.\n It seemed wrong to think of being nestled up against him, in absolute peace, when there was so much grief and heatbreak around them. Another woman was dead, and she lay alone in some cold, dark room while her family was left to weep and wonder.\n It had to be wrong to feel this soft glow of happiness, this insistent spring of hope when death hovered so close.\n But she was in love.\n Sighing, she curled on the window seat, where she could see the moonlight stream into the garden. The flowers were silver-edged and still, a touch of magic waiting to be plucked. Beyond, far beyond, was the glint of the pond that was Sweetwater. She couldn\u0027t see the willows, and was glad. If that was hiding from pain, then for one night she would hide. For now it was only a beautiful spot laced by moonlight.\n And she was in love.\n It wasn\u0027t possible to choose the time and the place to lose your heart. Caroline had come to believe it wasn\u0027t possible to choose the person who would take it. Surely if she could have chosen, it wouldn\u0027t have been here and now. It wouldn\u0027t have been Tucker.\n It was a mistake to fall in love now, when she was just beginning to understand her own needs and capabilities. Now, when she had only begun to learn she could stand on her own, in charge of her life. It was foolish to fall in love here, in a place torn apart by tragedy and senseless violence, a place she would have to leave in a matter of weeks.\n It was ridiculous to fall in love with a man who had made a study of romance and seduction. A charmingly lazy womanizer. A murder suspect. A poetry-spouting wastrel.\n Hadn\u0027t she told herself he was just another Luis with a southern twist? And that by falling for him, she was proving herself to be the kind of woman who always chooses poorly and lives to regret the results?\n But she couldn\u0027t make herself believe it, as much as she\u0027d once wanted to. There was more to him than that, more than he admitted to himself. She\u0027d seen it in the way he cared for Cy, in his loyalty to family, in the way he quietly held the reins of Sweetwater and a dozen businesses without strutting his power or demanding gratitude.\n With Tucker it wasn\u0027t self-deprecation, it was simply his way. Here was a man who did what needed to be done, and did what was right without thinking about it. And who did it without stirring up the air with demands and worries and desperation about tomorrow.\n No, the air around Tucker Longstreet was as calm and placid as the naps he was so fond of taking in the summer shade. As peaceful as a long, lazy tale spoken in a drawl to the music of a porch rocker. And as smooth as a cold beer savored on a hot night.\n That was what she needed, Caroline thought as she rested her head against the window glass. That basic acceptance that life was usually a joke, and a person should be able to smile her way through it.\n She needed to smile right now, Caroline thought. She needed that island of serenity he so effortlessly carried with him.\n She needed him.\n So why was she sitting here, searching for sleep, when what she wanted was within reach?\n On impulse she uncurled from the window seat. On her way to the terrace doors she plucked a sprig of freesia from a vase. She stopped by the gilt-framed mirror long enough to smooth her hair. Just as she touched her hand to the knob of the doors, they opened to the sultry night. And to Tucker.\n Her heart gave a quick, giddy leap that had her stepping back.\n \"Oh, you startled me.\"\n \"I saw your light.\" He wore loose cotton pants and carried a blade of sweet peas. \"Figured you couldn\u0027t sleep either.\"\n \"No, I couldn\u0027t.\" She looked down at the freesia in her hand, then smiled and held it out to him. \"I was coming to you.\"\n The gold of his eyes deepened as he took her flower and offered Caroline his. \"Isn\u0027t that something? Here I was thinking that since your notions of propriety wouldn\u0027t let you come to my room, I\u0027d have to come to yours.\" He skimmed his fingers through her hair, then cupped her neck. Against her cool skin, his hand was hot and firm. \" \u0027Desire hath no rest.\u0027 \"\n She stepped forward, into him. \"I don\u0027t want rest.\"\n Reaching behind, he pulled the door closed. \"Then I won\u0027t give you any.\"\n He caught her against him, and the first kiss was hungry, as if it had been years rather than hours since they\u0027d tasted. The flavor of need was potent and addicting. They fed on it, enhancing appetites with murmurs and sighs.\n Breathless, she pressed her lips to his throat, clinging to him as they stumbled toward the bed. He caught her hand as she reached for the lamp, drew her fingers to his mouth to nibble and suck.\n \"We don\u0027t need the dark.\" Then he smiled and covered her body with his.\n While they made love in the light, and most of Innocence slept uneasily, McGreedy\u0027s bar was hopping. It was the beginning of a long weekend that would culminate in Fourth of July celebrations. The town council, which consisted of Jed Larsson, Sonny Talbot, Nancy Koons, and Dwayne, had-after heated debate-decided against canceling the annual parade, carnival, and fireworks display.\n Patriotism and economics had swayed the vote. FunTime, Inc., had already been paid a hefty deposit for the carnival\u0027s two-night stand, and the fireworks had cost the town treasury a pretty penny. As Nancy had pointed out, the Jefferson Davis High School band and the Twinkling Batons majorettes had been practicing for weeks. To cancel the celebration at this late date would disappoint the kids and lower everyone\u0027s morale.\n It was pointed out that it was unseemly and disrespectful to ride Crack the Whips and have pie-eating contests with Darleen Talbot barely cold. It was argued back that the Fourth was a national holiday, and that Innocence had ordered up its own patriotic celebration for more than a hundred years.\n It was finally decided that a short speech honoring Darleen and the other victims would be given from the bandstand, and a moment of silence would be observed.\n So banners and bunting had been hung while Teddy autopsied Darleen in Palmer\u0027s embalming room.\n In McGreedy\u0027s some of the patrons had already begun the celebration. If the laughter was a bit wild or forced, if tempers were edgy, McGreedy was content in the knowledge that his Louisville Slugger was handy behind the bar.\n He kept an eye on Dwayne, who was drinking quietly and steadily at the end of the bar. Since he was sticking to beer tonight, McGreedy didn\u0027t worry overmuch. It was whiskey that set Dwayne off, and at this point Dwayne looked more unhappy than drunk.\n He knew he\u0027d probably have to swing his bat and kick a few butts before the weekend was over. Tonight seemed friendly enough, though there were a few hardcases huddled in the corner, tossing them back and talking quiet. Whatever they were planning, he\u0027d see that they took it elsewhere.\n Billy T. Bonny took a slug of house whiskey. It pissed him off that McGreedy watered it down, but tonight he had other things on his mind. Every damn body in town knew he\u0027d been seeing Darleen on the sly.\n It was a matter of pride that he do something about her murder.\n The more he drank, the more it seemed to him that he and Darleen had been in love.\n He was among friends, half a dozen like-thinking men, including his brother, who were tanking up on liquor and hate. They spoke in undertones, wanting to keep their circle closed.\n \"It ain\u0027t right,\" Billy T. muttered again. \"We\u0027re supposed to sit around with our fingers up our asses while some jerkoff from the FBI takes care of things. Well, he sure as fuck didn\u0027t take care of Darleen.\"\n There was a general murmur of agreement. Cigarettes were lit. Deep thoughts were considered.\n \"What the hell good did some Yankee lawman do her?\" Billy T. demanded. \"Him and Burke and the rest of them\u0027re running around in circles while somebody hacks up our women. Oh, we\u0027re good enough to go out and look for bodies, but we\u0027re not supposed to do anything to protect what\u0027s ours.\"\n \"Probably raped \u0027em, too,\" Will said to his beer. \"Probably raped the shit out of \u0027em before he sliced \u0027em. You gotta figure it.\"\n Wood Palmer, cousin to the undertaking Palmers, nodded sagely. \"Them psychos always do. It\u0027s \u0027cause they hate their mothers and want to screw them all at the same time, so they use other women.\"\n \"That\u0027s bull.\" Billy T. finished off his whiskey and signaled the waitress for another. His blood was already so pumped with alcohol, he could have opened a vein and fueled his gas tank. \"It\u0027s \u0027cause they hate women. White women.\"\n \"There ain\u0027t been no black woman killed, has there?\" his brother piped up. John Thomas had been drinking shooters for the best part of two hours, and was raring for hell. \"Four women dead and not one of them colored.\"\n \"That\u0027s a fact,\" Billy T. said, and snatched up his whiskey the minute it was served. \"And I guess that tells the tale.\"\n Wood scratched the stubble of his beard while the others grunted in agreement. What Billy T. was saying made good sense to him, especially filtered through a haze of tequila. \"I heard tell their heads was nearly cut clean off and their sex organs was carved up. That\u0027s psycho stuff.\"\n \"The cops want us to think like that.\" Billy T. struck a match, watched it burn. There was fire in his blood tonight, and it needed someplace to spread. \"Like they wanted us to think it was Austin Hatinger killed his own daughter. Well, we know it wasn\u0027t.\" As the match fizzed out between his thumb and forefinger, he shifted his gaze from face to face, and what he saw pleased him. \"We know it was a nigger. But we got us a Yankee fed, a nigger deputy, and a sheriff who\u0027d sooner lock up a white man than a colored.\"\n Will cracked a peanut. He was drinking beer and drinking slow. Justine was already giving him grief about spending so much of his pay on drink and pool. \"Come on, Billy T., Sheriff Truesdale\u0027s okay.\"\n \"If he\u0027s so okay, how come we got four women dead and nobody paying for it?\"\n As all eyes turned on him, Will, sober enough to be prudent, decided to keep his own counsel.\n \"I\u0027ll tell you why,\" Billy T. continued. \" \u0027Cause they know who did it, sure as Christ. They know but they don\u0027t want any trouble from the N.A.A.C.P. or any of those other egg-sucking groups. It\u0027s the niggers and the ever-fucking liberals responsible.\"\n \"They ain\u0027t hardly talked to no coloreds either,\" Wood muttered. \"Don\u0027t seem right.\"\n \"That\u0027s \u0027cause it ain\u0027t,\" Billy T. said viciously. \"But there\u0027s been one they\u0027ve talked to right enough.\" He struck another match for the pleasure of watching it burn. \"They\u0027ve been over to talk to Toby March. That special fucking agent asked plenty of questions about him.\"\n \"Talking\u0027s all they do,\" Wood mumbled. \"And we got another woman dead.\"\n \"Talk\u0027s all they\u0027re gonna do.\" Billy T. nodded as the others began to shift restlessly in their chairs. He could feel it, the hate, the fear, the frustration all melding together in a pot simmering with the summer heat and flavored by whiskey. \"They\u0027ll keep talking and asking questions, and he\u0027ll do it again. Maybe one of our women next time.\"\n \"We got a right to protect our own.\"\n \"It\u0027s time somebody put a stop to it. One way or the other.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\" Billy T. wet his lips and leaned in. \"And I think we know what needs to be done. It\u0027s that March bastard doing it. They homed right in on him, then backed off. They even know he has a taste for white meat.\"\n \"He was sniffing around Edda Lou, that\u0027s for sure,\" John Thomas put in. \"Somebody shoulda fixed him then. Fixed him good.\"\n \"And you know what he\u0027s doing?\" They all turned to listen to Billy T. \"He\u0027s laughing at them. Laughing at us. He knows they don\u0027t want no race trouble down here in Mississippi that those Yankee papers can turn all inside out. He knows they\u0027re going to look the other way \u0027lest they catch him with a knife in some white woman\u0027s throat.\"\n \"It\u0027s him all right,\" his brother agreed. \"Didn\u0027t I see him standing at Edda Lou\u0027s window?\"\n \"He was working at the rooming house,\" Will began.\n \"That\u0027s right.\" Billy T. sneered. \"Working on how he was going to get Edda Lou out to the swamp so he could rape and kill her. He done work for Darleen, too. She told me how he came to patch her roof.\"\n \"He done work out to the trailer court where Arnette and Francie lived, too,\" Wood put in. \"I seen him having a soda pop with Francie and laughing.\"\n \"That\u0027s how they tie all together.\" Billy T. took a last drag on his cigarette. \"He got around them that way, and starting thinking how he\u0027d like to do it to them. How he hated them for being women. White women. The cops don\u0027t want to see it, but I do. I see it plain, and I\u0027m not giving that black bastard the chance to kill another of our women.\" He leaned forward, sensing the moment was right. \"I got me some nice strong rope in the back of my car. Every one of us here\u0027s got a rifle he knows how to use. I say we kick off our Independence Day by ridding Innocence of a killer.\"\n He pushed back from the table and stood. \"Anybody\u0027s with me, get your gun and meet at my place. We got us a murderer to hang.\"\n Chairs scraped against the scarred wooden floor. Men started out with an air of purpose tinged with vengeance, their pulses pounding with a sense of right sweetened by the anticipation of violence.\n As they trooped out into the hot, sweaty night, McGreedy noted that they looked as though they were hunting for trouble. But as they were hunting it elsewhere, he went back to drawing drafts.\n At the door, Wood glanced back to Will, who was standing by the empty table. \"You coming, boy?\"\n \"You bet.\" Will lifted his beer and sloshed it down his dry throat. \"I\u0027ll be right along.\"\n With a nod that was as much warning as assent, Wood went off to fetch his Remington.\n \"Oh, Jesus.\" Will gulped down more beer. He didn\u0027t want the other men to think he was pussy. That was the worst thing a man had to live down. But he was thinking, now, maybe there was something worse yet.\n Hanging somebody.\n He wasn\u0027t quite drunk enough to see it as justice. Nor was he sober enough to see it as murder. What he saw was Toby March twitching at the end of a robe-eyes rolling and bulging, face going purple, feet kicking empty air.\n He didn\u0027t have the stomach to watch, and that was the sad truth. And if he didn\u0027t, he\u0027d lose the respect of the men he drank with most every week. There was only one way to solve the problem as he saw it. That was to stop it before it happened.\n Wiping his mouth dry, he walked over to Dwayne.\n \"Dwayne? You gotta listen to me.\"\n \"Go on, Will. I told you I\u0027d wait another week on the rent.\"\n \"It\u0027s not about that. You see those boys that just left?\"\n Annoyed with the interruption to his drinking, Dwayne scowled into his beer. \"I\u0027m making it a point not to see anything.\"\n \"They\u0027re going out to the March place. They\u0027re going out there with a rope.\"\n Slowly, Dwayne lifted his head and focused. \"What do they want to do that for?\"\n \"They mean to hang Toby March. They\u0027re going to string him right up, Dwayne, for killing all those women.\"\n \"Shit, boy. Toby\u0027s never killed anything but a possum in his life.\"\n \"Maybe, maybe not, but they went off to get their guns. Billy T.\u0027s dead certain Toby done it, and he\u0027s fired up for a lynching.\"\n \"Shit.\" Dwayne rubbed his hands hard over his face. \"Then I guess we\u0027d better stop them.\"\n \"I can\u0027t do that.\" Shaking his head, Will backed up. \"They\u0027ll ride me from now to next year if they think I chickened out. I\u0027ve done all I\u0027m going to.\"\n People had come to expect sudden outbursts from Dwayne when a bottle was nearby. That was why no one did more than glance his way when he shoved the table aside and grabbed Will by the throat.\n \"The fuck you have. Toby gets hurt tonight, I\u0027ll see that you pay for it, same as the others do.\"\n \"Chrissakes, Dwayne. I can\u0027t go against my own kind any more than I have.\"\n \"You want to keep that roof over your head, and the job that\u0027s paying for it\"-Dwayne lifted Will up on his toes and shook-\"you get your ass over to the sheriffs office. You don\u0027t find Burke or Carl there, you go find them at home, and you tell them what you told me.\"\n \"Dwayne, Billy T. finds out I did, he\u0027ll kill me.\"\n \"Bonny ain\u0027t going to be killing anybody.\" He tossed Will toward the door. \"Do it.\"\n Half asleep and limp with pleasure, Caroline snuggled up to Tucker. She roused herself to trail a lazy line of kisses up his chest to his chin.\n \"I always thought propriety was overrated.\"\n \"Stick with me, darlin\u0027.\" He curved a hand over her hip. \"You\u0027ll forget there ever was such a thing.\"\n \"I think I already have.\" Her lips curved against his shoulder before she rested her cheek there. \"Can we sleep like this?\"\n \"Like babies,\" he promised, idly rubbing her back. He didn\u0027t pay much attention to the roar of the car down the lane, or the slamming of doors, the pounding of feet up the stairs. If Dwayne was drunk, or Josie was peeved at whomever she\u0027d been sleeping with, it could wait until morning.\n But Caroline stirred and started to speak even as Dwayne began to shout Tucker\u0027s name.\n \"Shitfire. He does pick his times.\" He kissed Caroline\u0027s shoulder as he rolled over and grabbed up his pants. \"Just wait right here and I\u0027ll go quiet him down.\"\n Tucker listened to his brother banging on doors and swore. He swung the door open and stepped out into the hall. \"Jesus H. Christ, Dwayne, you\u0027re going to wake up the whole house.\"\n \"Already has,\" Cousin Lulu said from her doorway. She was wearing a Redskins football jersey and a headful of purple curlers. \"I was having a right good dream about Mel Gibson and Frank Sinatra, too.\"\n \"Go back to sleep, Cousin Lulu. I\u0027ll handle him.\"\n Wild-eyed, Dwayne burst out of Tucker\u0027s room. \"Doesn\u0027t anybody sleep in their own bed anymore? Get your gun, boy. We\u0027ve got trouble.\"\n \"The only trouble here is the beer you\u0027ve been slopping down in McGreedy\u0027s.\" Delia grabbed his arm and tried to haul him to his own room. \"What you need\u0027s a face full of ice to cool you off.\"\n Dwayne shook her off and rushed to Tucker. \"I don\u0027t know how much time we have. They\u0027re going to lynch Toby March.\"\n \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\n \"I\u0027m talking about the Bonny boys and a bunch of their asshole friends going after Toby right this holy minute with a rope.\"\n \"Oh, Christ.\" Tucker saw Caroline come to the doorway, clutching her robe at her throat. \"Wait for me,\" he said.\n \"I\u0027m going with you.\" Delia was halfway down the hall in her red-feathered peignoir before Tucker stopped her.\n \"You\u0027re staying right here. I don\u0027t have time to argue with you. Call Burke. Tell him fireworks are starting ahead of schedule.\"\n Delia stood as they clattered down the steps. She bristled until the feathers rustled.\n \"There are only two of them,\" Caroline said from behind her. \"If Burke doesn\u0027t get there with help, it\u0027ll be only Tucker and Dwayne.\"\n Cousin Lulu examined her nails. \"I can still shoot Lincoln\u0027s face off a one-cent piece at five yards.\"\n Delia turned back, nodded. \"Get some pants on.\"\n Toby rolled over in bed when their old mutt Custer began to bark. \"Damn dog,\" he muttered.\n \" \u0027S your turn,\" Winnie said sleepily.\n \"How do you figure?\"\n \"I\u0027m the one who got up every night to nurse two babies.\" She opened her eyes and smiled at him in the moonlight. \"Just like I\u0027m going to get up with this next one in about six more months.\"\n Toby skimmed a hand over her still-flat tummy. \"Guess it\u0027s only fair I deal with the dog.\"\n \"Get me a glass of that orange soda pop while you\u0027re up.\" She patted his bare butt before he pulled on his undershorts. \"A pregnant woman\u0027s got cravings.\"\n \"You sure did have them a couple hours ago.\"\n That earned him a giggle and another slap. Toby stumbled, yawning, out of the room.\n He saw the reflection of the fire in the front room window, that glitter of gold and red on the glass that made his heart sink and his blood boil.\n He bit back an oath, hoping to get rid of the obscenity on the lawn before any of his family could be hurt by it. He was a man of deep faith and did his best to love his fellow man. But in his heart was a cold hate for whoever had lit the cross on his land.\n He pushed open his door, stepped out on his porch. And found a gun poked into his naked belly.\n \"It\u0027s Judgment Day, nigger.\" Billy T.\u0027s lips spread in a grin. \"We just come by to send you to hell.\" Enjoying the power, he jabbed with the rifle barrel. \"Toby March, you\u0027ve been tried and convicted for the rape and murder of Darleen Talbot, Edda Lou Hatinger, Francie Logan, and Arnette Gantry.\"\n \"You\u0027re crazy.\" Toby could barely get the words through his lips. The dog was quiet now, and he could see old Custer crumpled on the grass-dead or stunned. Rage came quickly, then he saw the rope John Thomas Bonny and Wood Palmer were swinging over the branch of a gnarled oak. Fear followed. \"I never killed nobody.\"\n \"Listen to this, boys.\" Billy T. gave a cackle while his eyes stayed dark and flat on Toby\u0027s. \"He says he didn\u0027t do it.\"\n Even through terror, Toby recognized that they were all piss-yourself drunk. That only made them more dangerous.\n One of the others leaned on his shotgun and brought a pint of Black Velvet to his lips. \"Might as well hang him for a liar, too.\"\n \"His neck\u0027ll stretch just the same. You nigger boys can dance, can\u0027t you?\" Billy T. grinned until his eyes turned to slits. \"You\u0027re going to do some dancing tonight. Why, your feet ain\u0027t even going to touch the ground. When you finish dancing, we\u0027re going to burn your place to the ground.\"\n Fear turned Toby\u0027s bowels to ice. They would kill him. He could see that in their eyes. He would fight them, and he would lose. But he couldn\u0027t lose his family as well.\n He shoved the rifle, felt the bullet sear his rib cage as it exploded. \"Winnie!\" He shouted in despair and terror. \"Run. Get the children and run!\" As he clutched at his wounded side, Billy T. brought the rifle butt down in his face.\n \"Coulda killed him.\" On a nervous giggle, Billy T. wiped the back of his hand over his mouth. \"Coulda blown a hole in his belly, but that\u0027s not the way. We\u0027re gonna hang him,\" he yelled to the others. \"Drag him on over.\"\n He saw the woman rush out, shotgun blasting. In her terror, Winnie fired wide. Billy T. backhanded her and knocked the gun clear. \"Lookie here.\" He snatched the struggling woman around the waist. \"She\u0027s going to protect her man.\" When she clawed at him, he struck her again so that she fell dazed to the porch. \"Hold on to her, Woody. Truss her up. When that cocksucker wakes up, we\u0027ll show him how it feels to have his woman raped.\"\n \"I ain\u0027t raping no woman,\" Wood muttered, already having doubts about the whole night\u0027s work.\n \"Then you can watch, too.\" Billy T. reached down and yanked Winnie down the steps by the hair. \"Take hold of her, goddammit. John Thomas, you go in and bring those nigger kids out here. They got a lesson to learn.\"\n Winnie began to scream, one keening wail after another. She kicked and bit and clawed as Wood bound her hands behind her back.\n There was a shout from the house, a curse and a crash. John Thomas staggered back out to the doorway, his shoulder seeping blood. \"He cut me.\" Holding out one bloody hand, he stumbled to his knees. \"The little fucker cut me.\"\n \"Christ almighty, can\u0027t even handle a kid.\" Billy T. walked over to examine his brother\u0027s wound. \"You\u0027re bleeding like a stuck pig. One of y\u0027all bind this up. Keep an eye on the house. That boy comes out, do what you have to do.\" Near where the cross burned, Toby began to groan and stir. \"I\u0027m going to do this myself. For Darleen.\" He leaned over. One of Toby\u0027s eyes had swollen shut, but there was fear in the other. Billy T. fed on it.\n It was power. He tasted it and found it heady. All his life he\u0027d been second rate. Now he was about to do something important, even heroic. No one would ever look at him the same way again.\n \"I\u0027m going to put this noose around your neck, boy.\" He reached up and snagged it. Dragging Toby to a kneeling position, he pulled the loop of rope around Toby\u0027s neck. \"I\u0027m going to tug it nice and tight.\" He slid the knot down until it pressed evilly against flesh. \"But we\u0027re not going to string you yet. First I\u0027m going to do to your wife what you did to those white women.\" He grinned as Toby fought against the rope and gag. \"Only I bet I can make her like it. And when she\u0027s yelling for more, we\u0027re going to hang you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t hold with raping no woman,\" Wood said, firmly this time. Snarling, Billy T. whirled, bringing the gun up with him.\n \"You just shut the fuck up, then. It ain\u0027t rape, it\u0027s justice.\"\n \"I can\u0027t stop this bleeding.\"\n Billy T. glanced over to where one of the men tried to staunch the wound on his brother\u0027s shoulder. \"Well then, let him bleed for a goddamn minute. Won\u0027t kill him.\" He was losing them. He could feel it in the way the men were shifting their feet, shifting their eyes away from the woman who lay bleeding on the ground.\n He set his gun down and unbuckled his belt. He was already hard at the idea of taking a woman by force. Once they saw how it was, what kind of man he was, they\u0027d be behind him again.\n \"Somebody\u0027s coming, Billy.\"\n \"Probably that Will. Always was a day late and a dollar short.\"\n He stepped over to Winnie, straddled her. He hooked a hand in the bodice of her nightgown when the car fishtailed to a halt, kicking dust as rifle fire split the air.\n \"I got this pointed right at your balls, Billy T.\" Tucker stepped out of the car, skin twitching at the idea of having guns aimed at him. \"It\u0027s got more of a kick than I do, I guarantee.\"\n \"This ain\u0027t your concern.\" Billy T. straightened, cursing himself for setting his weapon aside. \"We come out here to do what should have been done already.\"\n \"Yeah, burning crosses is your style. Like killing an unarmed man.\" He saw the blood on Winnie\u0027s face and was sickened. \"Hitting women. It takes a lot of guts to come out here, what, six of you against one man, a woman, and a couple of kids.\"\n \"This nigger\u0027s been killing our women.\"\n Tucker merely lifted a brow. \"For all I know, you\u0027ve been doing it.\"\n \"We\u0027re hanging us a killer tonight. You think you can stop us? You and your drunken brother?\" He hauled Winnie up in front of him and took two backward steps to reach his gun. \"Seems to me there\u0027s six of us and two of you.\"\n Another set of headlights sliced the dark, and Delia\u0027s Olds cruised to a halt. Three women stepped out with rifles.\n \"Remind me to give them all hell later,\" Tucker muttered to Dwayne. \"Looks like the odds just changed,\" he said to Billy T. \"Evened up quite a bit.\"\n \"You think we\u0027re worried about a bunch of women?\"\n To show her feelings about that, Delia let off a shot that plowed the earth between Wood\u0027s feet. \"Y\u0027all know I can shoot. And these two ladies here, well, they\u0027re liable to get lucky. Caroline, you aim that Winchester at that asshole bleeding by the porch. He ain\u0027t liable to be moving around too much, so you should get a clean shot.\"\n Caroline swallowed, then shouldered the rifle.\n \"Fuck this.\" Wood tossed down his gun. \"I ain\u0027t shooting at no women any more than I\u0027d be raping one.\"\n \"Then you might want to step out of the line of fire,\" Tucker advised him. \"Looks like it\u0027s five to five.\" His lips curved as he heard the siren. \"And that\u0027s about to change. Now, if I were you, Billy T., I\u0027d set that woman down, real gentle like. Otherwise, my finger\u0027s going to slip and I\u0027m going to blow a hole through your brother.\"\n \"Jesus Christ, Billy, put her down.\" John Thomas scrambled back against the steps.\n Billy T. licked his lips. \"Maybe I\u0027ll put one through you.\"\n \"I expect you could. But since you can\u0027t work that rifle one-handed, you\u0027ll have to put her down just the same. Then we\u0027ll take our chances.\"\n \"Put her down, Billy,\" Wood said quietly. \"The gun, too. This is crazy business here.\" He turned to the others. \"This is crazy business.\"\n In agreement, they tossed down their guns.\n \"You\u0027re standing alone now,\" Tucker pointed out. \"You can die alone, too. Doesn\u0027t make a damn bit of difference to me.\"\n In disgust, Billy T. dropped Winnie to the ground, where she began to sob and crawl toward her husband. After tossing his gun aside, he started to walk toward his car.\n \"I\u0027d stand where you are,\" Tucker said quietly.\n \"You won\u0027t shoot me in the back.\"\n Tucker squeezed off a round that shattered the windshield. \"The hell I wouldn\u0027t.\"\n \"Go ahead and do it,\" Cousin Lulu suggested. \"Save the taxpayers money.\"\n \"That\u0027s enough.\" Caroline wiped sweaty hands on her jeans and hurried over to Winnie. \"There\u0027s nothing to worry about now.\"\n \"My babies.\"\n \"I\u0027ll go to them in just a minute.\" She fought the knot loose from Winnie\u0027s wrists, hoping to free her before the children saw it. But they were already racing out of the house, Jim still carrying the butcher knife stained with John Thomas\u0027s blood, and the little girl tripping over the hem of her nightgown.\n \"Here now.\" Caroline dragged the noose over Toby\u0027s head. Her vision wavered with tears as she took the bloody knife to cut his bonds. \"You\u0027re hurt.\" Her fingers came away wet as she touched his side. \"Somebody call the doctor.\"\n \"We\u0027ll get him to the hospital.\" Tucker knelt down. Burke and Carl were already reading Billy T. and the others their rights. \"What do you say, Toby? Up to a ride?\"\n He was holding his family, his good eye leaking tears as he gathered them close. \"Guess I could stir myself.\" He tried a wan smile while Winnie wept against his chest. \"You driving?\"\n \"You bet.\"\n \"We\u0027ll get there fast anyway.\"\n \"There you go. Dwayne, give me a hand here. Delia, you take the kids on down to Sweetwater. Caroline.\" Tucker looked around as she stood and walked away. \"Where are you going?\"\n She didn\u0027t look back. \"To get a hose and put out this obscenity.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence/page-26.html","bookId":2411,"book":{"id":2411,"title":"Carnal Innocence","description":"Storyline: \n In the small town of Innocence, Mississippi, days are long, nights are fragrant, and secrets are hard to keep. But when a brutal killer starts claiming the lives of the town\u0027s most attractive women, lifelong neighbors are forced to wonder if the culprit is a stranger lurking in the bayou...or someone right next door. \n World-famous concert violinist Caroline Waverly knows nothing of the murders when she arrives in Innocence. Burned out from a childhood lost to endless rehearsals and an all-too-public breakup with the conductor who was her lover, Caroline is looking for a little peace and some time to think. She hopes that a stay at her late grandmother\u0027s house the one with a covered porch just made for soft summer nights will provide the tranquillity she needs. But Innocence has something else to offer Caroline: a man named Tucker Longstreet. \n Blessed with the Longstreet good looks, lazy charm, and family fortune, Tucker is a tall, cool drink of water and he knows it. He likes to keep his romances short and shallow. But one look at Caroline, and Tucker realizes that she is unlike any other woman he\u0027s met. Tightly coiled and coolly reserved, Caroline is determined to fight him off. She might be able to do a better job if she hadn\u0027t felt an unexpected thrill at his ardent advances...and if she hadn\u0027t been so scared after finding a third murder victim in the murky waters behind her home. \n For Caroline Waverly,a beautiful summer interlude could turn into much more or could stir a killer\u0027s crazed dreams. Because there\u0027s just one small problem with her new romance: Tucker is the leading suspect in the killings.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/carnal-innocence.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:48 AM"}}
