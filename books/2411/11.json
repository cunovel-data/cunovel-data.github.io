{"id":75146,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Junior Talbot stepped out of the cab of his tow truck, stuck a finger under his Atlanta Braves fielder\u0027s cap, and dug through his tangled mop of red hair to scratch his head. He made a long, slow circle around Tucker\u0027s mangled Porsche, his J. C. Penney work boots crunching on shards of glass. His pale blue eyes were sober in his round, powerfully freckled face. Thoughtfully, he pulled at his full bottom lip. Caroline thought he looked like Howdy Doody on tranquilizers. \"Seems like you got yourself some trouble here,\" he said at length. \"Little bit,\" Tucker agreed. \"Got a smoke, Junior?\" \"Guess so.\" Junior pulled a pack of Winstons from the breast pocket of his grease-stained work shirt. He shook the pack, shooting a cigarette out to the filter, carefully replacing the pack after Tucker had taken it. Then he crouched down to contemplate the mashed fender. There was another long moment of silence. \"Sure used to be a pretty car.\" Tucker knew Junior wasn\u0027t rubbing his nose in it. It was simply his nature to state the obvious. Leaning over, Tucker opened the glove compartment and found a pack of matches. \"I s\u0027pose they can fix her up, down in Jackson.\" Junior thought about that awhile. \"I s\u0027pose,\" he decided. \"Could be you bent the frame, though. They got a way of straightening them out now. Used to be, you bent the frame and that was all she wrote.\" Tucker smiled through a haze of smoke. \"You just can\u0027t stop progress.\" \"That\u0027s the truth.\" Taking his time, Junior straightened, then studied the torn grass on the verge of the road, the shower of glass, and the lack of skid marks. After some consideration, he decided to have a cigarette himself. \"You know, Tucker, I always said you were the best driver I\u0027ve seen, outside of the time I went down to Daytona to watch the 500.\" Caroline gave a snort, and was politely ignored. \"I recall how you took the Bonny boys for twenty dollars in the drag race down on Highway One-back in July of seventy-six it was. They put their Camaro up against your Mustang.\" Junior accepted a match from Tucker and lit it with a flick of his thumbnail. \"Wasn\u0027t no contest.\" Tucker remembered the race with pleasure. \"Might\u0027ve been closer if Billy T. had let John Thomas drive.\" Junior nodded agreeably. \"Closer, maybe. But neither of those boys got the talent for driving you have.\" \"Idiots,\" Caroline said under her breath. If Junior heard her, he pretended not to. He\u0027d been a married man more than a year now, and knew when a man should let his ears work and when he shouldn\u0027t. \"I gotta ask you,\" Junior continued in the same slow, quiet voice. \"How\u0027d you happen to hit this pole here?\" \"Well...\" Tucker took a considering drag. \"You could say the car got away from me. Steering seized up.\" Junior nodded and continued to smoke. Caroline nearly asked them if they\u0027d like her to go back and fetch a couple of folding chairs so they could have their conversation in comfort. \"Don\u0027t look to me like you even hit the brakes.\" \"I hit them,\" Tucker said. \"They were out.\" Junior eyes came as close to sharp as they ever did. If it had been anyone else, he would have shrugged off the story. But he knew and admired Tucker\u0027s skill at the wheel. \"Now, that\u0027s a puzzle. Bad steering, bad brakes, all at once in a car like this? No more than six months old, is she?\" \"Just.\" Junior nodded again. \"We\u0027ll have to take a look.\" \"I\u0027d be obliged if you would, Junior.\" Caroline held her tongue until Junior walked back to his tow truck. \"What the hell does a drag race more than fifteen years ago have to do with you crashing into my mail post?\" Tucker smiled. \"It was a hell of a night. Get on back from the car now, darlin\u0027. It might shift some when he hooks it on.\" Careful to keep her sympathy close to the surface, Tucker slid an arm around her shoulders, leaned a little of his weight on her, and allowed her to help him move back a few feet. \"Are you dizzy?\" He wasn\u0027t, but there was such sweet concern in her voice. \"Maybe a little,\" he said-bravely, he thought. \"It\u0027ll pass.\" He bit back a smile when her arm curved around his waist in support. \"Let\u0027s get you back in the car.\" She\u0027d insisted on driving him to the end of the lane rather than allowing him to walk. \"I\u0027ll take you home.\" Home, hell. He was just starting to make progress. \"Maybe I could just stretch out on your couch till I get my strength back.\" She was wavering, he could tell. When he heard the blare of a horn, he had to swallow an oath. Dwayne screeched his white Caddy to a stop, dead in the middle of the road. He hadn\u0027t shaved yet, and his hair was sticking out at all angles. He had pulled a pair of pants over his Jockeys and had added a muscle shirt. \"Jesus H. Christ, boy.\" He glanced at Tucker, saw he was standing on both feet, and gave his attention to the car Junior was hooking up. \"Out for a Sunday drive, Dwayne?\" \"Crystal called.\" Dwayne whistled through his teeth as he took a look at the front end of the Porsche. \"Seems Singleton Fuller was in the Mobile when Junior got the call. He ran into Jed Larsson, then Crystal stopped in for a six-pack of Cokes. Good thing I answered the phone before Josie, or she\u0027d\u0027ve had a hissy fit for sure.\" His hangover, thanks to Josie\u0027s stock of pills and remedies, had backed off enough to make him sympathetic. \"Shit on toast, Tuck, you sure did kill that pretty little toy.\" Out of patience, Caroline sucked in a breath. \"He\u0027s doing as well as can be expected,\" she shot out. \"It could have been worse, but as it happens he only rapped his concrete head. It\u0027s understandable that you\u0027re so concerned about your brother\u0027s condition, but let me reassure you. He\u0027ll be fine.\" Junior had stopped what he was doing to stare, the cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. Dwayne blinked. Tucker struggled not to lose his dignity by hooting with laughter. She was crazy about him, he decided. \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" Dwayne said, meticulously polite. \"I can see he is. I just rode down so I could take him home.\" \"What a concerned, close-knit family you must be.\" \"We do tend to stick together.\" When he smiled, there was something charming about him despite the bloodshot eyes, the barroom glow. \"I\u0027ve never known another family like yours,\" Caroline said sincerely. \"She\u0027s all set, Tuck,\" Junior called. \"I\u0027ll let you know what\u0027s what.\" \"You do that. Thanks.\" Tucker had to turn away. He just couldn\u0027t watch his car being towed off. It was almost as bad as watching a loved one being carried away on a stretcher. \"Nice to see you again, Caroline,\" Dwayne began, then headed to his car. \"Let\u0027s go, Tucker. There was a game starting when Crystal called. I\u0027ve missed the whole first inning by now.\" \"In a minute.\" Tucker turned back to Caroline. \"I appreciate the nursing.\" He touched a hand to her hair. \"And the listening. I didn\u0027t realize I needed someone to listen.\" It took her a moment to understand he was being sincere. There were no teasing lights in his eyes, no trace of mockery in his voice. \"You\u0027re welcome.\" \"I\u0027d like to pay you back.\" When she started to shake her head, Tucker cupped her chin. \"I\u0027d like you to come to dinner tonight, at Sweetwater.\" \"Really, Tucker, you don\u0027t have to-\" \"It occurs to me that I\u0027d like you to see me under some better circumstances than I\u0027ve managed so far.\" His thumb traced along her jawline. \"And I\u0027d just like to see you, period.\" Her heartbeat skittered for a moment, but her voice was clear. \"I\u0027m not interested in starting anything, not with anyone.\" \"Having neighbors in for Sunday dinner\u0027s an old country custom.\" She had to smile. \"I don\u0027t mind being neighborly.\" \"Shit, Tuck, would you just kiss her and come on?\" Smiling back, Tucker brushed a finger over her lips. \"She won\u0027t let me. Yet. Come on down around five, Caro. I\u0027ll show you around Sweetwater.\" \"All right.\" She watched him walk to the Caddy, ease in carefully beside his brother. He flashed her a quick grin before Dwayne shot toward Sweetwater, the Caddy hugging dead center of the road. \"Here I come rushing home from the bake sale, thinking you\u0027ve cracked your skull or worse, and you tell me company\u0027s coming.\" Delia whacked her rolling pin down on the pie crust. \"Now I don\u0027t even know how much we took in. Had to leave Susie Truesdale in charge, and she don\u0027t know squat about salesmanship.\" As this particular refrain had been playing for the best part of three hours, Tucker decided to act. He pulled a twenty out of his pocket and slapped it on the counter. \"There. That\u0027s my contribution to the Trinity Lutheran bake sale.\" \"Hmph.\" But Delia\u0027s nimble fingers snatched up the bill and tucked it away in the deep pocket of her apron. She was far from through. \"Nearly had me a spell when Earleen came running down to tell me you\u0027d gone and wrecked that car. Told you when you bought it, no good comes of buying foreign. Out racing the roads on the Lord\u0027s day, too.\" She flipped the crust into a pie plate. \"And when I come hurrying home to see if you\u0027re dead or alive, you tell me you\u0027ve invited a guest for dinner.\" Fuming, she trimmed and fluted the edges. \"As if that ham in the oven was going to fix itself. Edith\u0027s grandbaby, too. I had a great fondness for Edith, and she told me how her grandbaby\u0027d been to Paris, France, and Italy, walked right into Buckingham Palace and even had dinner with the President of the United States in the White House.\" She pounded out the next crust. \"Here she\u0027s coming to dinner and I ain\u0027t had time to see if the silver needs polishing. Your mama\u0027d turn over in her grave-God rest her-if I weren\u0027t to use the good silver.\" She wiped the back of her wrist over her brow. Her heavy charm bracelet danced and jangled. \"It\u0027s just like a man to think Sunday dinner makes itself.\" Tucker scowled down at the potato he was peeling. \"I\u0027m helping you, aren\u0027t I?\" She gave a superior sniff and glanced at him. \"Fine help you are. You\u0027re taking too much meat off them \u0027taters- and getting peelings all over my clean floor.\" \"Jesus Christ-\" Delia\u0027s eyes flashed with the cold ire Tucker respected. \"Don\u0027t you use the Lord\u0027s name in vain-not in my kitchen on Sunday.\" \"I\u0027ll clean up the floor, Delia.\" \"See that you do-and not with one of my good dishrags neither.\" \"No, ma\u0027am.\" It was time to pull out the big guns, Tucker decided. He set the bowl of potatoes in the sink, then moved over to wrap his arms around Delia\u0027s considerable waist. \"I just wanted to do something nice for Caroline after she\u0027d patched up my head.\" Delia grunted. \"I\u0027ve see what she looks like. I can guess what that something nice is.\" He grinned into her wild red curls. \"Can\u0027t say the thought hasn\u0027t passed through my mind.\" \"Passed under your zipper, more like.\" But her lips were quirking. \"Seems a bit skinny for your taste.\" \"Well, see, I figured she\u0027d flesh out some, especially after sampling your cooking. You know there\u0027s nobody in the county who can set a table compared to yours. I kind of thought I\u0027d like to impress her, and the surefire way was to have her taste some of your honey-glazed ham.\" Delia snorted and shifted, but the flush of pride was creeping up her cheeks. \"I guess I don\u0027t begrudge giving the girl a decent meal.\" \"Decent?\" He gave Delia a squeeze. \"Sugar, she won\u0027t have had better in the White House. You can take that to the bank.\" Delia chuckled and slapped his hands away. \"She won\u0027t get nothing if I don\u0027t finish. You drop them \u0027taters in that kale I got simmering, then clear out. I can do this quicker without you sniffing \u0027round.\" \"Yes\u0027m.\" Tucker pressed a kiss to her cheek that made her grumble and grin. When he walked out of the steamy kitchen a few minutes later, he found Dwayne sprawled in the parlor watching another baseball game. \"Wouldn\u0027t hurt you to shave.\" Dwayne shifted and reached for the bottle of Coke sitting on the floor. \"It\u0027s Sunday. I never shave on Sunday.\" \"We\u0027ve got company coming.\" Dwayne took a long swallow, and swore when the shortstop bobbled the ball. \"If I shave, she might see that I\u0027m better looking than you. Then where\u0027d you be?\" \"I\u0027ll risk it.\" Dwayne snorted. \"They\u0027re going to be pulling this pitcher before the inning\u0027s up-if they got half a brain. I\u0027ll do it then.\" Satisfied, Tucker started upstairs. Before he reached his room, Josie called to him. \"Tucker? Is that you, honey?\" \"I\u0027m going to take a shower.\" \"Well, just come on back here for a minute and help me out.\" He checked the grandfather clock, saw he had a half hour before Caroline would arrive, and sauntered down the hall to Josie\u0027s room. It looked like a department store after a clearance sale. Blouses, dresses, lingerie, shoes, were tossed over bed, chair, and window seat. A black lace teddy hung suggestively from the trunk of a stuffed pink elephant some forgotten swain had won for her at the state fair. She was still wearing the little red robe and her head was stuck in her closet as she pawed through what was left hanging there. As always, there was a scent clinging to the air, a mixture of perfumes, powders, and lotions. The result was something between the perfume counter at Blooming dale\u0027s and a high-class bordello. Tucker gave the room a brief survey, and came to the obvious conclusion. \"Got a date?\" \"Teddy\u0027s driving me down to the nine o\u0027clock show in Greenville. I told him to come on to dinner, since we\u0027re having company anyway. How\u0027s this?\" She turned, holding a short orange leather skirt up to her waist. \"Too hot for leather.\" Josie pouted a minute because she knew the skirt showed off her legs, then tossed it aside. \"You\u0027re right. I know what I need, that little cotton dress, the pink one. I wore it at a garden party last month in Jackson and got a marriage proposal and three indecent propositions. Now, where the hell is it?\" Tucker watched as she started tossing through clothes already discarded. \"I thought you were trying out the doctor for Crystal.\" \"I did.\" She glanced up and grinned. \"Thing is, I decided he wasn\u0027t Crystal\u0027s type at all. And he\u0027ll be going back north in a day or two, and that would just break her heart. She couldn\u0027t afford to visit him if things got serious between them. And I can. Does your head still hurt?\" \"Not much.\" \"Look here.\" She pointed to a small bruise on her calf. \"You went tearing out of here so fast before, you kicked up gravel. Now I\u0027ll have to put Erase on that if I want to wear a skirt.\" \"Sorry.\" She shrugged and went back to looking for the pink dress. \"I guess it\u0027s okay. You were upset. Everybody\u0027s going to know she was lying, Tucker. Even before they bury her on Tuesday, everybody\u0027ll know.\" \"I expect so.\" He spotted a swatch of shell pink and crouched down to pull the dress out from under the pile. \"I\u0027ve calmed down, Josie. Hearing it from Burke just fired me up.\" She touched the bandage on his forehead, and they stood close, in a drift of Josie\u0027s perfume. They shared more than their mother\u0027s face, more than the Longstreet name. Between them was a tie deeper than blood. It went to the heart. \"I\u0027m sorry she hurt you, Tucker.\" \"Poked a few holes in my pride, that\u0027s all.\" He kissed Josie lightly on the lips. \"They\u0027ll heal up fast enough.\" \"You\u0027re just too nice to women, Tucker. It makes them fall in love with you, then you\u0027ve got nothing but trouble. If you were a little harder on them, you wouldn\u0027t get their expectations up.\" \"I\u0027ll keep that in mind. Next time I take a woman out, I\u0027ll tell her she\u0027s ugly.\" Josie laughed and stood up to hold the dress in front of her as she twisted and turned in front of her cheval glass. \"Don\u0027t go reciting any poetry, either.\" \"Who says I do?\" \"Carolanne told me you talked poetry when you took her over to Lake Village to look at stars.\" Tucker shoved his hands in his pockets. \"How come women always tell the intimate details of their life over a manicure or a permanent?\" \"It\u0027s the same as men bragging about the size of their wangers over a bottle of beer. How\u0027s this look?\" He scowled. \"I\u0027m finished handing out compliments to females.\" Josie only chuckled as he strode off to shower. Caroline was so stunned by Sweetwater that she stopped her car halfway up the drive to stare. The house was pearly white in the afternoon sun, all gracious curves and delicate ironwork, slender columns and glinting windows. It took no imagination at all to picture women in hoop skirts strolling across the grass, or gentlemen in frock coats sitting on the porch discussing the possibility of secession while silent black servants served cool drinks. Flowers grew everywhere, climbing up trellises, spilling over the borders of brick-edged beds. The heady smells of gardenia, magnolia, and roses perfumed the air. A Confederate flag, faded and ragged at the edges, hung from a white pole in the center of the front lawn. Beyond the house, she could see neat stone buildings. What once were slave quarters, smokehouse, summer kitchen-she could guess that much. The lawn stretched back to acre after acre of flat, fertile land thick with cotton. She saw a single tree in the center of one of the fields, a huge old cypress left standing either through laziness or sentiment. For some reason that-just that single tree-brought tears to her throat. The simple majesty of it, the endurance it symbolized, touched her in some deep corner of her heart. Surely it had stood there for more than a century, watching over the rise and fall of the South, the struggle for a way of life, and the ultimate end of it. How many spring plantings had it seen, how many summer harvests? She shifted her gaze back to the house. It, too, symbolized continuity and change, and the stately elegance of the Old South that so many from the north thought of as indolence. Babies had been born there, grown up and died there. And the rhythm of this quiet spot on the delta went on. And on. The slow pulse of their culture and traditions survived. The proof was here, just as it was in her grandmother\u0027s house, in those houses and farms and fields dotting the road into Innocence. And in Innocence itself. She wondered why she was just beginning to understand that. When she saw Tucker come out the front doorway to stand on the porch, she wondered if she was beginning to understand him as well. She got the car moving again, eased it around the island of peonies, and stopped. \"The way you were sitting back there on the drive, I was beginning to think you\u0027d changed your mind.\" \"No.\" She opened the car door and stepped out. \"I was just looking.\" He was doing some looking of his own, and decided not to speak until the fingers squeezing his heart loosened up. She was wearing a thin white dress, with a full skirt he imagined would billow gloriously in a breeze. Two finger-width straps held it over her shoulders and left her arms bare. There was a necklace of polished stones around her throat. Her hair was sleeked back to set off matching stones that dangled from her ears. She\u0027d done something mysterious and female to her face, deepening her eyes, darkening her mouth. As she mounted the steps toward him, he caught the first whiff of her light, tempting scent. He took her right hand in his left, and turned her slowly in a circle under the arch of his arm, as if in a dance. It made her laugh. When he saw how low the dress dipped in the back, he swallowed hard. \"I\u0027ve got to tell you something, Caroline.\" \"All right.\" \"You\u0027re ugly.\" He shook his head before she could comment. \"That\u0027s just something I had to get out of my system.\" \"It\u0027s an interesting approach.\" \"My sister\u0027s idea. It\u0027s supposed to keep women from falling in love with me.\" Why did he always make her want to smile? \"It could work. Are you going to ask me in?\" He traded her left hand for her right. \"It seems like I\u0027ve been waiting a long time to do just that.\" He led her to the door, opened it. Pausing, he studied her, wanting to see how she looked in the doorway-his doorway-with flowers and magnolia trees at her back. She looked, he realized, perfect. \"Welcome to Sweetwater.\" The moment she stepped inside, Caroline heard the shouting. \"If you\u0027ve gone and asked somebody to come and sit at my table, the least you can do is set it.\" Delia stood at the base of a curving stairway, one hand braced on a mahogany newel post, the other on her sturdy hip. \"I said I would, didn\u0027t I?\" Josie\u0027s voice tumbled down the steps. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re in such a god-awful lather about. I\u0027m going to finish putting my face on, then I\u0027ll get to it.\" \"Way she\u0027s messing around with those paints, it\u0027ll get set next week.\" Delia turned. The righteous indignation on her face gave way to curiosity when she spotted Caroline. \"Well now, you\u0027re Edith\u0027s grandbaby, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, I suppose I am.\" \"Edith and I, we used to have ourselves some nice chats out on her front porch. You favor her a bit, \u0027round the eyes.\" \"Thank you.\" \"This is Delia,\" Tucker announced. \"She takes care of us.\" \"I\u0027ve been trying for the best part of thirty years, but it ain\u0027t done all that much good. You take her on into the guest parlor and give her some of the good sherry. Dinner\u0027ll be ready before long.\" With a last scowl at the stairway, she lifted her voice. \"If somebody would stop tarting herself up and come set the table.\" \"I\u0027d be happy to do it,\" Caroline began, but Delia was already pulling her along the hallway toward the living room. \"No sir, you\u0027ll do no such thing. Tucker peeled the potatoes and that girl\u0027s going to set out the china. Least she can do after asking that dead doctor to dinner.\" She patted Caroline\u0027s arm then scurried off toward the kitchen. \"Ah... dead doctor?\" Tucker grinned, strolling over to an antique walnut server for the sherry. \"Pathologist.\" \"Oh, Teddy. He\u0027s certainly an... interesting character.\" She took a slow sweep of the room with its tall windows, lace curtains, Turkey carpets. The twin settees, as she was sure they were called, were in misty pastels. Cool colors predominated in the subtle stripes of the wallpaper, the hand-worked pillows, the plump ottoman. The richness of antiques melded with it. On the mantel above the white marble fireplace was a Waterford vase filled with baby roses. \"This is a lovely house.\" She took the glass he offered. \"Thank you.\" \"I\u0027ll give you the grand tour sometime. Tell you the whole history.\" \"I\u0027d like to hear it.\" She walked to the window where she could look out at the garden and beyond to the fields and the old cypress. \"I didn\u0027t realize you farmed.\" \"We\u0027re planters,\" he corrected her as he came up behind her. \"Longstreets have been planters since the eighteenth century-right after Beauregard Longstreet cheated Henry Van Haven out of six hundred acres of prime delta farmland in a two-day poker game down in Natchez in 1796. It was in a bawdy house called the Red Starr.\" Caroline turned. \"You made that up.\" \"No ma\u0027am, that\u0027s just the way my daddy told it to me, and his daddy to him, and so on since that fateful April night in ninety-six. \u0027Course it\u0027s just speculation about the cheating part. The Larssons put in that bit-they\u0027re by way of being cousins of the Van Havens.\" \"Spoilsports,\" Caroline said, smiling. \"Could be that, or it could be the God\u0027s truth, but neither changes the outcome.\" He was enjoying the way she looked at him, her lips tilted up just a little, her eyes laughing. \"Anyhow, Henry got so irritated about losing the land, he tried to ambush old Beau when Beau finished celebrating with one of the Starr\u0027s best girls. Her name was Millie Jones.\" Caroline sipped and shook her head. \"You ought to write short stories, Tuck.\" \"I\u0027m just telling you the way it was. Now, Millie was pleased with Beau\u0027s performance-did I mention that the Longstreets have always been known as exceptional lovers?\" \"I don\u0027t believe you did.\" \"Documented, through the ages,\" Tucker assured her. He loved the way laughter brightened her eyes, softened her mouth. If he hadn\u0027t had a story to tell, by God he would\u0027ve made one up. \"And Millie, being grateful for Beau\u0027s stamina-and the extra five-dollar gold piece he\u0027d left on the night stand, went on over to the window to wave him off. It was she who spotted Henry in the bushes with his flintlock loaded and ready. At just the right moment, Millie shouted a warning. The gun went off. Beau\u0027s frock coat was singed at the arm, but his reflexes were keen. He pulled out his knife and sent it whipping into the brush where the shot had come from. Hit Henry dead in the pump, as my grandpappy used to say.\" \"He was, of course, an expert at knife-throwing as well as lovemaking.\" \"A man of many talents,\" Tucker agreed. \"And being a prudent man as well, he decided it best not to stay around Natchez and answer uncomfortable questions about a deed, a dead man, and an Arkansas Toothpick. Being a romantic, he took pretty young Millie out of that bawdy house, and they traveled to the delta.\" \"And planted cotton.\" \"Planted cotton, got rich, and had babies. It was their son who started building this house, in 1825.\" Caroline said nothing for a moment. It was much too easy to become caught up in the flow of his words, the easy rhythm of his voice. It\u0027s not really the point - how much is true and how much is made up, she decided. It\u0027s all in the telling. She moved away from the window, acutely aware that he was about to touch her again, and less sure if she\u0027d want to stop him. \"I don\u0027t know much of anything about my family history. And certainly nothing that goes back two hundred years.\" \"We look back more than forward in the delta. History makes the best gossip. And tomorrow... well, tomorrow\u0027s going to take care of itself anyway, isn\u0027t it?\" He thought he heard her sigh, but the sound was so soft, it might have been silence. \"I\u0027ve spent my whole life thinking about tomorrow-planning next month, next season. It must be the air here,\" she said, and this time she did sigh. There was something wistful in the sound. \"I\u0027ve hardly thought of next week since I walked into my grandmother\u0027s house. Haven\u0027t wanted to, anyway,\" she said, remembering the phone calls from her manager that she\u0027d been dodging ever since she decided to come to Mississippi. He had a strong urge to hold her-just to offer her the circle of his arms and the support of his shoulder. But he was afraid the gesture would spoil whatever was happening between them. \"Why are you unhappy, Caro?\" Surprised, she looked back at him. \"I\u0027m not.\" But she knew it was only part of the truth. And part of the truth was a lie. \"I listen almost as well as I talk.\" His hand was gentle as he touched her face. \"Maybe you\u0027ll try me sometime.\" \"Maybe.\" But she moved back, marking the distance. \"Someone\u0027s coming.\" Now he knew the time wasn\u0027t right, and turned to the window again. \"The dead doctor,\" he said, and grinned. \"Let\u0027s go see if Josie set the table.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence/page-11.html","bookId":2411,"book":{"id":2411,"title":"Carnal Innocence","description":"Storyline: In the small town of Innocence, Mississippi, days are long, nights are fragrant, and secrets are hard to keep. But when a brutal killer starts claiming the lives of the town\u0027s most attractive women, lifelong neighbors are forced to wonder if the culprit is a stranger lurking in the bayou...or someone right next door. World-famous concert violinist Caroline Waverly knows nothing of the murders when she arrives in Innocence. Burned out from a childhood lost to endless rehearsals and an all-too-public breakup with the conductor who was her lover, Caroline is looking for a little peace and some time to think. She hopes that a stay at her late grandmother\u0027s house the one with a covered porch just made for soft summer nights will provide the tranquillity she needs. But Innocence has something else to offer Caroline: a man named Tucker Longstreet. Blessed with the Longstreet good looks, lazy charm, and family fortune, Tucker is a tall, cool drink of water and he knows it. He likes to keep his romances short and shallow. But one look at Caroline, and Tucker realizes that she is unlike any other woman he\u0027s met. Tightly coiled and coolly reserved, Caroline is determined to fight him off.
