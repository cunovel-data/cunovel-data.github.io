{"id":75142,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Tucker propped his feet on Burke\u0027s desk and crossed his ankles. He didn\u0027t mind waiting-in fact, waiting was one of the things he did best. What was often interpreted as a bone-deep laziness, even by Tucker himself, was an innate and boundless patience and a clear, untroubled mind. At the moment his mind wasn\u0027t as unfettered as he liked. And the truth was, he hadn\u0027t slept well the night before. A little catnap while he waited for Burke to come along seemed like a sensible way to pass the time. It hadn\u0027t taken long for news of the FBI blowing into town to get down to Sweetwater. Tucker already knew that Special Agent Burns dressed like a mortician and drove a tan Mercury. Just as he knew that Burns was down at McNair Pond doing whatever FBI types did at murder scenes. Murder. With a little grunt Tucker closed his eyes-the better to relax. Sitting there, listening to the creak of the ceiling fan and the whine of the useless window air conditioner, it didn\u0027t seem possible that Edda Lou Hatinger was stretched out on a slab a few blocks away at Palmer\u0027s Funeral Parlor. He winced, trying to get beyond the discomfort, the plain creepiness of remembering how ready he\u0027d been to go head to head with her. Worse, he\u0027d been looking forward to the battle, to hearing her wail when she finally got it through her conniving brain that she wasn\u0027t going to be the new mistress of Sweetwater. He wouldn\u0027t have to set her straight now. Or salvage some of his pride by hacking at hers. Now, because he\u0027d made the mistake of finding something sexy about the way she punched keys on the cash register at Larsson\u0027s, because he\u0027d indulged himself by sharing her bed and nibbling on that soft skin, he was going to have to make up an alibi to keep himself from being a suspect in her murder. He\u0027d been accused of many things. Of laziness, which was no sin in Tucker\u0027s book. Of carelessness with money, which he readily admitted. Of adultery, which he took objection to. He\u0027d never slept with a married woman-except for Sally Guilford a few years back, and she\u0027d been legally separated. Even of cowardice, which Tucker preferred to think of as discretion. But murder. Why, it would be laughable if it wasn\u0027t so scary. If his father had been alive, he\u0027d have busted a gut laughing. He-the only man Tucker had truly feared-hadn\u0027t been able to bully or embarrass his son into shooting anything but thin air on any of their enforced hunting trips. Of course, Edda Lou hadn\u0027t been shot. Not if she\u0027d been killed like the others. Because it was all too easy to slide her face over his image of Francie\u0027s, to see what had been done to her smooth, white skin. He fumbled in his pocket for a cigarette. He pinched off part of the tip-he was up to nearly a quarter of an inch now-and was just lighting it when Burke walked in with a sweaty, annoyed-looking man in a dark suit. Spending the best part of the day with the FBI hadn\u0027t put Burke in the best of moods. He scowled at Tucker\u0027s feet as he tossed his hat toward the pole by the door. \"Make yourself at home, son.\" \"Doing my best.\" Tucker blew out a stream of smoke. His stomach was jumping, but he sent Burke a lazy smile. \"You ought to get yourself some new magazines, Burke. A man needs more to entertain his mind than Field and Stream and Guns and Ammo.\" \"I\u0027ll see if we can find some issues of Gentleman\u0027s Quarterly and People.\" \"I\u0027d be obliged.\" Tucker took another drag while he scanned Burke\u0027s companion. The dark suit had wilted in the heat, but the man didn\u0027t have the sense to loosen his tie. Though he couldn\u0027t have said why, that simple fact had Tucker taking an instant dislike to Burns. \"I thought it\u0027d be a good idea for me to come on in and talk to you boys.\" Burke nodded, and wanting to take authority, walked behind his desk. \"Tucker Longstreet, Special Agent Burns.\" \"Welcome to Innocence.\" Tucker didn\u0027t get up, but offered a hand. It pleased him that Burns\u0027s was soft, and a little clammy from the humidity. \"What makes you special, Agent Burns?\" \"It\u0027s my rank.\" Burns took a measure of Tucker\u0027s scuffed sneakers, his casually expensive cotton slacks, and cocky grin. The dislike was mutual. \"What did you want to discuss, Mr. Longstreet?\" \"Well now, we could start with the weather.\" Tucker ignored Burke\u0027s warning look. \"Looks like we\u0027ve got a storm rolling in. Might cool things off for a spell. Or we could talk baseball. Orioles\u0027re playing the Yankees tonight. Birds got themselves a tight pitching staff this year. Might just pull it off.\" Tucker sucked in smoke. \"You a betting man, Special Agent?\" \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t take an avid interest in sports.\" \"Well, that\u0027s okay.\" There was a yawn in Tucker\u0027s voice as he angled the chair back. \"I don\u0027t take an avid interest in much of anything. Avid takes too much effort.\" \"Let\u0027s get to the point, Tuck.\" Since the look hadn\u0027t worked, Burke tried his quiet, cut-the-bullshit tone. \"Tucker knew the victim, Edda Lou...\" \"The word you\u0027re scratching for is intimately,\" Tucker provided. His stomach muscles clenched up on him again, so he shifted to crush out the cigarette. Burns settled in the third chair. In his fussily efficient way, he took a mini recorder and a pad from his pocket. \"You wanted to make a statement.\" \"Like \u0027The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\u0027?\" Tucker stretched his back. \"Not particularly. Burke here thought you might want to ask me some questions. And being the cooperative sort, I\u0027m here to answer them.\" Unruffled, Burns switched on the recorder. \"I\u0027m informed that you and the deceased had a relationship.\" \"What we had was sex.\" \"Come on, Tuck.\" He shot Burke a look. \"That\u0027s as honest as it gets, son. Edda Lou and I went out a few times, had some laughs, and tangled some sheets.\" His eyes hardened, and he had to stop himself from reaching for another cigarette. \"Couple weeks back I cut things off because she started talking marriage.\" \"You ended the affair amicably?\" Burns asked. \"I wouldn\u0027t say that. I figure you already know about the scene in the diner a few days ago. It\u0027s safe to say Edda Lou was pissed.\" \"Your term, Mr. Longstreet. I have it here\"-he tapped his pencil on his pad-\"that she was angry and agitated.\" \"You put those two words together with Edda Lou, and what you get is pissed.\" \"She claimed you\u0027d made her promises.\" Lazily, Tucker lowered his legs. The chair squeaked as he rocked it. \"That\u0027s the thing about me, Agent Burns, I don\u0027t make them, \u0027cause it\u0027s unlikely I\u0027ll keep them.\" \"And she announced publicly that she was pregnant.\" \"Yeah. She did that.\" \"After which, you left the... Chat \u0027N Chew, is it? You left abruptly.\" He smiled thinly. \"Would it be safe to say, Mr. Longstreet, that you were... pissed?\" \"Having her come down on me in the diner, tell me-for the first time, in front of maybe a dozen people-that she was pregnant, and threatening to make me pay for it? Yeah.\" He gave a slow, considering nod. \"It\u0027d be safe to say.\" \"And you had no intention of marrying her.\" \"Not a one.\" \"And being infuriated, embarrassed, and trapped, you had a motive for killing her.\" Tucker ran his tongue over his teeth. \"Not as long as I\u0027ve got a checkbook.\" He leaned forward. Though his face was hard, his voice flowed easily, like honey over corn bread. \"Let me give you a clear picture of this, friend. Edda Lou was greedy, she was ambitious, and she was smart. Now, maybe there was a part of her figured she could intimidate me into a double-ring ceremony, but she\u0027d have settled happily enough for a check with enough zeroes on it.\" He rose, then forced himself to take a breath and sit on the corner of the desk. \"I liked her. Maybe not as much as I once did, but well enough. You don\u0027t sleep with a woman one week and slice her up the next.\" \"It\u0027s been done.\" Something dark came alive in Tucker\u0027s eyes. \"Not by me.\" Burns shifted the recorder an inch to the right. \"You were also acquainted with Arnette Gantrey and Frances Alice Logan.\" \"Me and most everybody else in Innocence.\" \"Did you also have relationships with them?\" \"Dated them some. Didn\u0027t sleep with either.\" His lips curved a little in memory. \"Though with Arnette, it wasn\u0027t for lack of trying.\" \"She rejected you?\" \"Hell.\" In disgust, Tucker pulled out another cigarette. It seemed he\u0027d picked a lousy time to try to quit smoking. \"We were friends, and she didn\u0027t want to wrestle. Truth is, she\u0027d always had her eye on my brother, Dwayne, but he never picked up the ball. Francie and I were just at the flirt-and-giggle stage.\" He tossed a bit of paper and tobacco aside. \"She was a sweetheart.\" He shut his eyes. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about Francie.\" \"Oh?\" Fury bubbled up. \"Look, I was with Burke when he found her. Maybe you\u0027re used to seeing that kind of thing, but I\u0027m not. Especially when it\u0027s someone I had a fondness for.\" \"Interesting that you were fond of all three women,\" Burns said mildly. \"And Mrs. Logan was found in Spook Hollow?\" He gave a quick snort at the term. \"That\u0027s just a couple of miles from your home. And Miss Hatinger was found in McNair Pond. Less than a mile from your home. You visited that spot the day you argued with Miss Hatinger.\" \"That\u0027s right. And plenty of other times.\" \"According to Miss Waverly, you seemed tense, upset, when she came across you.\" \"I thought we\u0027d settled on pissed. Yeah, I was. That\u0027s why I stopped off there. It\u0027s a peaceful spot. \"And a secluded one. Can you tell me what you did with the rest of your evening, Mr. Longstreet?\" It wasn\u0027t going to be the truth. \"I played gin with Josie, my sister,\" Tucker lied without a blink. \"Being as I was distracted, she took me for about thirty or forty dollars, then we had a drink and went on up to bed.\" \"What time did you leave your sister?\" \"I went up about two, two-thirty maybe.\" \"Agent Burns,\" Burke broke in, \"I\u0027d like to say that on the afternoon Edda Lou was found, Tuck came in to see me. He was worried because he hadn\u0027t heard from her, and she wasn\u0027t answering the phone.\" Burns lifted a brow. \"So noted, Sheriff. How did you come by your black eye, Mr. Longstreet?\" \"Edda Lou\u0027s father gave it to me. That\u0027s how I came to realize she was missing. He rode up to the house, figuring I was hiding her. Then he got it into his head I\u0027d talked her into going somewhere for an abortion.\" \"Did you discuss abortion with the deceased?\" \"She was deceased before I had a chance to discuss anything with her.\" He pushed himself off the desk. \"That\u0027s all I\u0027ve got to say. If you have any more questions, you ride on down to Sweetwater and ask. I\u0027ll see you around, Burke.\" Burke waited until the door slammed. \"Agent Burns, I\u0027ve known Tucker all my life. I can tell you that no matter how het up he was about Edda Lou, he couldn\u0027t have killed her.\" Burns merely switched off his recorder. \"Isn\u0027t it fortunate that I have an objective eye? I believe it\u0027s time we checked at the funeral parlor, Sheriff. The pathologist is due.\" Tucker\u0027d just about had it. He\u0027d done nothing but mind his own business, live his own life, and what did he have to show for it? Sore ribs, a swollen eye, and the novelty of being a murder suspect. He shot out of Innocence and cranked the car up to eighty. The way he figured it, it all had to do with women. If it hadn\u0027t been for the way Edda Lou had rubbed up against him every blessed time he\u0027d walked into Larsson\u0027s, he wouldn\u0027t have started dating her. If Delia hadn\u0027t nagged him, he wouldn\u0027t have been in town for Edda Lou to harp on. If that Waverly woman hadn\u0027t wandered into the bayou, she wouldn\u0027t have seen him sitting by the pond. Looking \"tense and upset.\" Jesus H. Christ, he\u0027d had a right to look that way. He was sick about Edda Lou, gut-churning sick. No matter how sneaky she\u0027d been, she didn\u0027t deserve to be dead. But dammit, he didn\u0027t see why he had to suffer for it. Having to sit there and take it while that stiff-necked Yankee bastard prodded him with questions and gave him those cop looks. Worse than cop looks, he thought as he swung around a curve. It had been those superior, big-city honcho-to-addled-good-old-boy sneers that burned his ass. Caroline Waverly had looked at him the same way. She\u0027d probably done handsprings on her way to tell the FBI about coming across the dirty Reb plotting murder in the swamp. A yard past the McNair lane, Tucker slammed on the brakes. His tires screamed on the pavement as he whipped into a U-turn. Maybe he\u0027d just go have himself a talk with the duchess. As he sent gravel spitting, he didn\u0027t notice the pick-up lumbering down the road. Austin\u0027s blackened eyes narrowed as he spotted the red flash disappearing into the brush. His lips spread in a smile as he pulled over to the side. He turned off the ignition, pocketed the keys before reaching for the shoe black. Studying himself in the rearview mirror, he sliced black lines under his eyes, adjusted his camouflage hat. From the rack in the window he chose his weapon, opting for the Remington Woodsmaster, and checked the load. He was still smiling as he stepped out of the truck, wearing full camouflage, with keen-edged hunting knife tucked in his ammo belt. He was going hunting. For the glory of the Lord. Caroline didn\u0027t mind being alone. Though she\u0027d enjoyed Susie\u0027s company, the woman\u0027s energy pitch had all but exhausted her. Nor did she believe that anyone was going to break into the house and kill her in her sleep. She was a stranger, after all, and no one knew her well enough to wish her harm. Now that the pistol was tucked away, she had no intention of touching it again. To please herself, she picked up her violin. She\u0027d barely had time to do more than tune it since arriving. Her hands passed over the smooth, polished wood, brushed over the strings. This wasn\u0027t practice, she thought as she rosined the bow. It wasn\u0027t performance. It was the urge she was often too pressured to remember, to make music for herself. With her eyes closed, she laid the violin on her shoulder, her head and body shifting automatically into position, as a woman\u0027s does to welcome a lover. She chose Chopin for the beauty, for the peace, and for the hint of a sadness she couldn\u0027t quite dispel. As always, the music filled all the voids. She didn\u0027t think of death now, or of fear. She didn\u0027t think of Luis and betrayal, of the family she\u0027d lost or done without. She didn\u0027t think of the music, but only felt it. It sounded like tears. That\u0027s what Tucker thought as he walked from his car to the porch. Not hot, passionate tears, but slow ones, aching ones. The kind that bled out of the soul. Though no one could hear them, his thoughts embarrassed him. It was just violin music, the longhaired kind that didn\u0027t even make you want to tap your toe. But it sounded so heartbreaking, drifting out of the open windows. He would have sworn he felt it, actually felt the notes shiver over his skin. He knocked, but so softly he barely heard the rapping himself. Then he reached down, opened the screen, and stepped inside. He moved quietly, following those haunting notes into the front parlor. She was standing in the center of the room, facing the windows so that he could see her profile, her head tilted slightly toward the instrument. Her eyes were closed, and the smile that curved her lips was as wistful and lovely as the music. Though he couldn\u0027t have said how he knew it, that particular melding of notes came straight from her heart. Like a whispered question, they hung on the air. He slipped his hands into his pockets, leaned a shoulder against the jamb, and let himself drift along with her. It was odd, and certainly foreign to him, that he could find a woman so restful, so quietly appealing, so deeply arousing, when it had nothing whatsoever to do with sex. When she stopped, the music fading off into silence, he felt a disappointment so keen it was almost physical. If he\u0027d been wise, he would have slipped out again while her eyes were still dreamy, and knocked. Instead, he went with instinct and clapped. She jolted, her body snapping into tension, her eyes filling with fear, then sharpening with simple annoyance. \"What the hell are you doing in here?\" \"I knocked.\" He gave her the same little shrug and grin he\u0027d offered by the pond. \"Guess you were too involved to hear me.\" She lowered the violin but held the bow up, somewhat like a fencer with a blade. \"Or it\u0027s possible I didn\u0027t want to be disturbed.\" \"Can\u0027t say I thought of it. I liked the music. I\u0027m more into R and B myself, a little jazz, but that was something. No wonder you do it for a living.\" She kept her eyes on his as she set the violin aside. \"What a fascinating compliment.\" \"Just an honest observation. You reminded me of a knickknack my mama had. It was a pearl caught in a big chunk of amber. It was the prettiest thing, but sad, too. The pearl was all alone in there and could never get out. You looked like that when you were playing. Do you always play sad songs?\" \"I play what I like.\" His bruises had blossomed over the last day. They gave his face a rakish, dangerous look, with just enough of the little boy to make a woman want to press something cool-her lips perhaps-on the swelling. \"Do you have a reason for walking into my house uninvited, Mr. Longstreet?\" \"You might as well make it Tucker. I\u0027m going to call you Caroline. Or Caro.\" His teeth flashed. \"That\u0027s what Miss Edith called you. I like it.\" \"That doesn\u0027t answer my question.\" He eased away from the jamb. \"We tend to drop by on neighbors around here, but as it happens, I did have a purpose. You going to ask me to sit down?\" She tilted her head. \"No.\" \"Damn. The nastier you are, the more I like you. I\u0027m perverse that way.\" \"And other ways?\" He chuckled and sat on the arm of the sofa. \"We\u0027ll have to get to know each other better first. You might hear I\u0027m easy, Caroline, but the thing is, I\u0027ve got my standards.\" \"What a relief.\" She tapped the bow against her open palm. \"As to your purpose?\" He cocked a foot on his knee, as thoroughly at home as a hound in a patch of green shade. \"Lord, I like the way you talk. As fine and cool as a bowl of peach ice cream. I\u0027m real partial to peach ice cream.\" When her lips threatened to quirk, she turned them down in defense. \"I\u0027m not terribly interested in your partialities at the moment, nor am I in the mood to entertain company. I\u0027ve had a difficult couple of days.\" The easy humor vanished. \"It was rough on you, finding Edda Lou that way.\" \"Rougher on her, I\u0027d say.\" He stood, reaching for a cigarette as he paced. \"Being as you\u0027ve been here a few days, you\u0027ll know everything that\u0027s been said.\" Though she tried, she couldn\u0027t prevent a twinge of sympathy. It was never easy to have your private life, your private mistakes the topic of hot speculation. She knew. \"If you\u0027re saying the gossip around here is as thick as the humidity, I won\u0027t argue.\" \"I can\u0027t stop you from thinking what you\u0027re inclined to think, but I want my say.\" She lifted a brow. \"I can\u0027t fathom why my thoughts would concern you.\" \"You jumped fast enough to give them to that shiny-shoed Yankee.\" She waited. The way he was pacing up and down the room struck as more frustrated than violent. She relaxed enough to set down the bow. \"If you\u0027re speaking of Agent Burns, I told him what I\u0027d seen. You were by the pond.\" His head whipped around. \"Sure I was there, goddammit. Did I look like I was planning to murder somebody?\" \"You looked angry,\" she tossed back. \"I have no idea what you were planning.\" He stopped, turned, and took a step toward her. \"If you think I did that to Edda Lou, why the hell are you standing here talking to me instead of running for your life?\" She jerked up her chin. \"I can take care of myself. Since I\u0027ve already told the police everything I know-which is essentially nothing-you\u0027d have no reason to hurt me.\" He balled his hands at his sides. \"Lady, you keep looking at me as if I were something you scraped off your shoe, and I might come up with a reason or two.\" \"Don\u0027t threaten me.\" Adrenaline began to pump through her, pushing her forward until she was nearly nose to nose with him. \"I know your kind, Tucker. You just can\u0027t stand it that I\u0027m not tripping over myself to get you to blink my way. It galls your male pride when a woman isn\u0027t interested. Then when one is, like this Edda Lou, you can\u0027t wait to shake her off. One way or another.\" It was close enough to the truth to sting. \"Honey, women come and women go. Doesn\u0027t mean a damn to me. I don\u0027t pine away for them, and I sure as hell don\u0027t kill them. And as far as tripping over yourself... Christ.\" She managed one short scream as he grabbed her and tossed her to the floor. Then the breath was knocked out of her when he landed hard on top of her. She heard the explosion, and thought for a moment it was the crack of her head hitting the hardwood. \"What the hell do you think-\" \"Stay down. Holy bleeding Jesus.\" His face was only inches from hers, and she saw something move into his eyes that might have been fear, or cunning. \"If you don\u0027t get off me this minute-\" Whatever she planned to do next was forgotten as she heard the next shot and watched a hole explode in the cushion of the couch just above their heads. \"My God.\" Her fingers dug into his arms. \"Someone\u0027s shooting at us.\" \"You caught on, sugar.\" \"What are we going to do?\" \"We could stay like this and hope he goes away. But he won\u0027t.\" On a sigh, he lowered his forehead to hers in a gesture that was curiously intimate. \"Shit. He\u0027s crazy enough to kill you, too, and figure it was God\u0027s will.\" \"Who?\" She pounded on his back. \"Who is it?\" \"Edda Lou\u0027s daddy.\" Tucker lifted his head a fraction. Under the circumstances, he didn\u0027t dwell on the fact that her mouth was ripe and full and naked. He noticed-but he didn\u0027t dwell on it. \"The woman who was killed? Her father is out there shooting at us?\" \"At me, mostly. But he wouldn\u0027t worry much about hitting you along the way. I got a glimpse of him through the window while he was sighting between my eyes.\" \"That\u0027s crazy. A man can\u0027t go around shooting into someone\u0027s house.\" \"I\u0027ll be sure to mention that to him if I get the chance.\" There was only one thing to do, and he hated it. \"You got a gun around here?\" \"Yes. My grandfather\u0027s. In the den, across the hall.\" \"Here\u0027s what I want you to do. Stay down, keep quiet.\" She nodded. \"I can do that.\" As he eased down her body, she grabbed his shirt. \"Are you going to shoot him?\" \"Christ, I hope not.\" He shimmied back, using the couch as cover, then sucking in a breath when he was forced to crawl out into the open. When he reached the doorway, he figured he was far enough away to keep any strays from hitting Caroline. \"Austin, you sonofabitch, there\u0027s a woman in here.\" \"My daughter was a woman.\" Another.44 slammed through the window, scattering glass. \"I\u0027m going to kill you, Longstreet. \u0027For this is the time of the Lord\u0027s vengeance.\u0027 I\u0027m going to kill you. Then I\u0027m going to slice you up into pieces, just like you done to Edda Lou.\" Tucker pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes and concentrated. \"You don\u0027t want to hurt the lady.\" \"Don\u0027t know if she\u0027s a lady. Might be another of your whores. The Lord\u0027s guiding my hand. This here\u0027s an eye for an eye. \u0027For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire. The wages of sin is death.\u0027 \" While Austin quoted scripture, Tucker belly-crawled across the hall. Once inside, he moved quickly. He grabbed a Remington and with sweaty hands loaded it, queasy at the knowledge that he might have to use it. He moved to the window, eased out the screen, and crawled through. The next shot had him babbling his own prayer as he hunched over and darted into the bush. Austin had picked his spot. Not two yards from the front of the house, he leaned against a lone maple. Sweat streamed off his face and dampened the back of his camo shirt. He called on Jesus, peppering his prayers and threats with rifle fire. All of the front windows were smashed. He could have rushed the house and ended it. But he wanted, needed, to know Tucker was suffering. For more than thirty years he\u0027d been waiting for a way to pay back a Longstreet. Now he\u0027d found it. \"I\u0027m going to shoot your nuts off, Tucker. Gonna blow away that cock you\u0027re so proud of. That\u0027s the justice for a fornicator. You\u0027ll go to hell dickless. That\u0027s God\u0027s will. You hear me, you heathen sinner? You hear what I\u0027m saying?\" With little regret Tucker shoved the rifle barrel into Austin\u0027s left ear. \"I hear you, no need to shout.\" He hoped Austin didn\u0027t notice the gun was wavering in his shaking hands. \"Put down the gun, Austin, or I\u0027ll have to put a bullet in your brain. Believe me, it\u0027ll be hard on me. You\u0027ll be dead, but I\u0027ll have to throw away this shirt. It\u0027s almost brand new.\" \"I\u0027ll kill you.\" Austin tried to turn his head, but Tucker poked hard with the rifle. \"Not today, you won\u0027t. Now, you toss that gun away, then you unbuckle that ammo belt. Slow and easy.\" When Austin hesitated, Tucker gave him another nudge. He got a ridiculous image of the barrel sliding right through Austin\u0027s head and poking out the other ear. \"I know I\u0027m not much of a shot, but even I can\u0027t miss when I\u0027ve got the barrel in your ear.\" He breathed a little easier when Austin tossed the gun aside. \"Caroline,\" he shouted. \"You give Burke a call now, tell him to get his ass down here on the double. Then bring me some rope.\" The moment the ammo belt hit the dirt, Tucker kicked it aside. \"Now, what was that about my dick, Austin?\" Two minutes later Caroline streaked out of the house with a length of clothesline. \"He\u0027s on his way. I just...\" She trailed off and stared down at the man sprawled in the grass. His face was battered and grimy with sweat and black streaks. Camouflage wear covered his tanklike torso and steel-girder legs. Despite the fact that Tucker stood over him, pointing a gun at the nape of his neck, the younger man looked toothpick-thin and vulnerable. \"I brought the rope,\" she said, swallowing when her voice squeaked. \"Good. Honey, you want to scoot around behind him?\" Moistening her lips, she gave Austin a wide berth. \"How did you... I mean, he\u0027s so big.\" \"Big mouth, too.\" He couldn\u0027t resist giving Austin a little nudge with his foot. \"He was so busy screaming his fire and brimstone, he didn\u0027t hear the sinner coming up behind him. Can you shoot this thing?\" \"Yes.\" She eyed the rifle. \"Sort of.\" \"Sort of\u0027s good. Ain\u0027t it, Austin? She\u0027s liable to shoot something vital off you if you move too quick. Nothing more dangerous than a female with a loaded gun. Unless it\u0027s a Yankee female. Here now. You just keep pointing that right at his head while I tie him up.\" He balanced the gun in her hands. Their eyes met with twin expressions of giddy relief. For an instant they were the fastest of friends. \"That\u0027s the way, sugar. Just don\u0027t point it at me. Now, if he moves, you just press your finger. Then close your eyes, \u0027cause it\u0027ll blow his head off, and I wouldn\u0027t want you to see something that nasty.\" He winked at her so that she understood the warning was for Austin\u0027s benefit. \"Okay. But I\u0027m a little shaky. I hope I don\u0027t press it without meaning to.\" Tucker grinned as he hunkered down to tie Austin\u0027s hands. \"Just do the best you can, Caro. Nobody can ask for better than that. Gonna hog-tie you, Austin. Seems to fit.\" He looped the cord and tugged, bowing Austin\u0027s beefy legs. \"Don\u0027t seem right to me that you blew out all this lady\u0027s windows. Ruined her davenport, too. As I recall, Miss Edith was fond of that davenport.\" He stepped back to take the gun from Caroline. \"Darlin\u0027, would you mind fetching me a beer? I\u0027ve worked up a thirst.\" She had an insane urge to laugh. \"I don\u0027t have any... beer, that is. I have some wine. Some chardonnay,\" she babbled. \"That\u0027d go down nice, too.\" \"All right. I... sure.\" She started up the steps, then turned back to see Tucker taking out a cigarette. Putting a hand to her giddy head, she watched him pinch off the tip. \"Why do you do that?\" \"Hmm?\" He squinted as he struck a match. \"Tear off the tip?\" \"Oh.\" He drew in smoke with every indication of pleasure. \"I\u0027m fixin\u0027 to quit. Seems a sensible way to go about it. Figure after a couple weeks, I\u0027ll be down to a half a smoke at a time.\" He smiled at her, wildly attractive and pale as a sheet. \"You put that chardonnay in a big glass for me now, okay?\" \"Yeah.\" She let out a shaky breath as she heard the wail of a siren. Tucker was still close enough that she heard the same sigh of relief from him. \"You bet.\" The screen door slammed behind her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence/page-7.html","bookId":2411,"book":{"id":2411,"title":"Carnal Innocence","description":"Storyline: In the small town of Innocence, Mississippi, days are long, nights are fragrant, and secrets are hard to keep.

World-famous concert violinist Caroline Waverly knows nothing of the murders when she arrives in Innocence. Burned out from a childhood lost to endless rehearsals and an all-too-public breakup with the conductor who was her lover, Caroline is looking for a little peace and some time to think. She hopes that a stay at her late grandmother\u0027s house the one with a covered porch just made for soft summer nights will provide the tranquillity she needs. But Innocence has something else to offer Caroline: a man named Tucker Longstreet. Blessed with the Longstreet good looks, lazy charm, and family fortune, Tucker is a tall, cool drink of water and he knows it. He likes to keep his romances short and shallow. But one look at Caroline, and Tucker realizes that she is unlike any other woman he\u0027s met. Tightly coiled and coolly reserved, Caroline is determined to fight him off. She might be able to do a better job if she hadn\u0027t felt an unexpected thrill at his ardent advances...and if she hadn\u0027t been so scared after finding a third murder victim in the murky waters behind her home. For Caroline Waverly,a beautiful summer interlude could turn into much more or could stir a killer\u0027s crazed dreams.
