{"id":75164,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\"Just how many of these lunatics you figure\u0027ll drop from heat stroke before two o\u0027clock?\" Cousin Lulu posed the question from the comfort of her personalized director\u0027s chair. A red, white, and blue umbrella was hooked to the back and tilted to a jaunty angle, while a thermos of mint juleps snuggled between her feet.\\n\\n \"We never have more than five or six faint on us,\" Delia said placidly from the web chair beside her. She didn\u0027t think she could outdo Lulu\u0027s pants, but she\u0027d stuck a miniature American flag in her bushy hair in an attempt. \"Most of them are young.\"\\n\\n As a marching band strutted by blaring Sousa, Lulu played along on a plastic zither. She enjoyed the wall of sound, the glint of brass in bright sun, but she couldn\u0027t help but think that a couple of swooning piccolo players would add some zip.\\n\\n \"That tuba blower there, the husky one with the pimples? He looks a bit glassy-eyed to me. Ten bucks says he drops in the next block.\"\\n\\n Delia\u0027s natural competitive instinct had her studying the boy. He was sweating freely, and she imagined his natty uniform was going to smell like wet goat before the day was up. But he looked hardy enough. \"You\u0027re on.\"\\n\\n \"I dearly love a parade.\" Lulu tucked her zither behind her ear like a pencil so she could pour another drink. \"Next to weddings, funerals, and poker games, I can\u0027t think of anything more entertaining.\"\\n\\n Delia snorted and cooled her face with a palm-sized battery-operated fan. \"You can have yourself a funeral tomorrow if you want. We\u0027ve been having us a regular plague of funerals lately.\" Sighing, Delia helped herself to some of the contents of Lulu\u0027s thermos. \"I reckon this is the first time in fifteen years that Happy hasn\u0027t marched on by with the Ladies Garden Club.\"\\n\\n \"Why ain\u0027t she marching?\"\\n\\n \"Her daughter\u0027s going in the ground tomorrow.\"\\n\\n Lulu watched the pom-pom division of Jefferson Davis High shake by to the tune of \"It\u0027s a Grand Old Flag.\"\\n\\n \"A good, whopping funeral\u0027ll set her to rights,\" Lulu predicted. \"What\u0027re you making for after the burying?\"\\n\\n \"My coconut ambrosia.\" Delia shaded her eyes and grinned. \"Why, look there, Cousin Lulu. Look at Carl Johnson\u0027s baby twirl that baton. She\u0027s a regular whirling dervish.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s a pistol, all right.\" Lulu enjoyed a cackle and another sip of julep. \"You know, Delia, life\u0027s like one of them batons. You can spin it around your fingers if you\u0027ve got the talent for it. You can toss it right up in the air and snatch it back if you\u0027re quick. Or you can let it fly and conk somebody on the head.\" She smiled and plucked the zither from behind her ear. \"I do dearly love a parade.\"\\n\\n From behind Lulu, Caroline thought over the analogy and shook her head. It made a spooky kind of sense. She wasn\u0027t sure if she\u0027d ever conked anyone on the head with the baton of life, but she\u0027d certainly dropped it a few times. Right now she was doing her best to make it spin.\\n\\n \"That there\u0027s the Cotton Princess and her court,\" Cy told Caroline. \"The whole high school votes on her every year. She was supposed to ride in back of Mr. Tucker\u0027s car, but since it got banged up, they rented that convertible from Avis in Greenville.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s lovely.\" Caroline smiled at the girl in her puffy-sleeved white dress and sweat-sheened face.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s Kerry Sue Hardesty.\" Watching her made Cy think of Kerry\u0027s younger sister, LeeAnne. She of the soft, fascinating breasts. As the car cruised by, Cy scanned the crowd, hoping for a glimpse. He didn\u0027t spot LeeAnne, but he did spot Jim, and waved desperately.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you go over and see your friend, Cy? You can meet us at the car when the parade\u0027s finished.\"\\n\\n He yearned, but shook his head and stood firm. Mr. Tucker was counting on him to stay close to Miss Caroline. They\u0027d had a real man-to-man talk about it. \"No, ma\u0027am. I\u0027m fine right here. There\u0027s Miss Josie and that FBI doctor. He\u0027s got one of those lapel flowers that squirts water in your face. He sure is a caution.\"\\n\\n \"He certainly is.\" Caroline was scanning the crowd herself. \"I wonder what\u0027s keeping Tucker.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing.\" From behind, Tucker slipped his arms around her waist. \"You didn\u0027t think I\u0027d miss watching a parade with a pretty woman, did you?\"\\n\\n Content, she leaned back against him. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"You want me to fetch you and Miss Caroline cold drinks, Mr. Tucker? I got pocket money.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right, Cy. I think Cousin Lulu\u0027s got what the doctor ordered in that jug down there.\"\\n\\n Cy jumped forward to take the cup Lulu poured and pass it back. \"That FBI man\u0027s watching from in front of the sheriffs office.\"\\n\\n \"So I see.\" Tucker sipped, savored, and handed the cup to Caroline.\\n\\n Caroline took her first taste of mint julep and let it slide sweet down her throat. \"He doesn\u0027t look as though he thinks much of the parade.\"\\n\\n \"Looks more like he smells dead skunk,\" Cy commented.\\n\\n \"He just doesn\u0027t understand.\" Tucker kept one arm around Caroline\u0027s waist, set his other hand on Cy\u0027s shoulder. \"Here comes Jed Larsson and his boys.\"\\n\\n When the fife and drum corps led by Larsson marched by playing \"Dixie,\" the crowd roared. Those seated rose to their feet and cheered.\\n\\n Caroline smiled and laid her head on Tucker\u0027s shoulder. She understood.\\n\\n The Fourth of July meant fried chicken, potato salad, and smoking barbecues. It was a day for flag waving and pie eating and drinking cold beer in the shade. There were those gathered close in mourning, and the law continued its grinding quest, but on this bright summer day, Innocence tossed a cloak of red, white, and blue over murder and celebrated.\\n\\n After the parade there were contests along Market Street and over in the town square. Pie eating, target shooting, foot racing, egg tossing, and-always a favorite-watermelon-seed spitting.\\n\\n In silent amazement Caroline gawked at the junior division pie-eating contest, where seven- to fourteen-year-olds buried their faces in blueberry, slurping and swallowing to the cheers of the crowd. Pie after pie was consumed, and more glistening tins shoved under purple-stained faces. Encouragement and gastronomic advice were shouted out as one by one the young entrants fell by the wayside. Groaning.\\n\\n \"Look at Cy.\" Caroline pressed a hand to her own stomach in sympathy. \"He must have eaten a dozen by now.\"\\n\\n \"Nine and a half,\" Tucker corrected her. \"But he\u0027s leading. Come on, boy, don\u0027t chew. Just let it slide on down.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see how he can breathe,\" she murmured as Cy buried his face in number ten. \"He\u0027s going to be sick.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Course he is. That\u0027s the way, Cy! Don\u0027t hold back now. He\u0027s got himself a nice rhythm,\" Tucker said to Caroline. \"He doesn\u0027t just smash his face into it and hope for the best, he works in a nice steady circle from the outside in.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t know how Tucker could tell. All she saw was a boy buried to the neck in blueberries while the crowd cheered and stomped. She told herself it was a silly game, messy and certainly undignified. But she was rocking back and forth from toes to heels, pulled in to the simple excitement.\\n\\n \"Come on, Cy! Swallow it whole. Leave them in the dust. Look! He\u0027s going for twelve. Oh, Jesus, he\u0027s got it sewed up now. Just-\" She glanced up at Tucker and found him grinning at her. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m crazy about you.\" He kissed her hard and long as Cy, a little green beneath the purple splotches, was declared champion. \"Plum crazy.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\" She brushed her fingers over his cheeks and into his hair. \"That\u0027s good. Now maybe I should help the winner scrub blueberry juice off his face.\"\\n\\n \"Let him get his own girl,\" Tucker decided, and pulled her along to the next event.\\n\\n They\u0027d cleared the parking lot of the Lutheran Church for the target shoot. McGreedy\u0027s had supplied the beer bottles, and Hunters\u0027 Friend the ammo. The elimination rounds went quickly with frustrated hopefuls unloading their weapons and taking a place on the sidelines.\\n\\n Tucker was pleased to see Dwayne preparing for the second round. It had taken a lot of fast, hard talk to convince his brother to participate in the day\u0027s events. He didn\u0027t want any gossip until it was impossible to avoid it. And he wanted Dwayne to continue acting normally. In Tucker\u0027s mind, normal equaled innocent.\\n\\n \"Both Dwayne and Josie are entered,\" Caroline commented.\\n\\n \"We were all taught to shoot early. Old Beau insisted on it.\"\\n\\n \"What about you? You\u0027re not after the grand prize of a smoked ham and a blue ribbon?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I never cared much for guns. There goes Susie.\" He waited until she\u0027d blasted away three bottles with three shots. \"Lordy, she\u0027s a cool hand. Good thing she married a lawman. With that aim she could\u0027ve taken up a life of crime.\"\\n\\n \"Cousin Lulu.\" Concerned, Caroline put a hand on Tucker\u0027s arm. Lulu swaggered up with a pair of Colts snug in a leather holster riding low on her bony hips. \"Do you really think she should-\" She broke off as the old lady drew and fired. The three bottles seemed to explode as one. \"Oh, my.\"\\n\\n \"She can handle anything from a.22 to an AK-47.\" He watched, entertained, as Lulu twirled a Colt around her finger in three fast circles, then shot it back home. \"But if she asks you to stand with an apple on your head, I\u0027d decline. She\u0027s not as young as she once was.\"\\n\\n It ended with Lulu edging out Susie and a very annoyed Will Shiver. The crowd began to gather back on the street for foot races.\\n\\n \"Sweetwater\u0027s doing well for itself.\" Caroline accepted the cold bottle of Coke Tucker passed her. \"Aren\u0027t you going to run?\"\\n\\n \"Run?\" Tucker lighted a cigarette and flipped away the match. \"Darlin\u0027, why would I want to get all tired and sweaty just to get from one point to another?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" She smiled to herself. \"I don\u0027t know what got into me.\" Sighing, she settled back against his chest while the first runners took their marks. \"So, you don\u0027t enter any event?\"\\n\\n \"Well now, there is one I usually go for.\"\\n\\n She turned her head to look back at him. \"Which?\"\\n\\n \"Wait and see.\"\\n\\n Greased pigs? Caroline had thought she\u0027d gotten into the spirit of things, but when she stood behind the temporary paddock in the town square listening to the porcine squeals, she realized she hadn\u0027t come close.\\n\\n Tucker had bowed off from eating pies, he didn\u0027t choose to shoot, and he yawned at the thought of racing. But he was standing in the paddock, stripped to the waist, waiting for the signal to go catch a lard-coated pig.\\n\\n Baffled, Caroline rested an elbow on Cy\u0027s shoulder. \"How are you feeling?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, just fine now,\" he assured her. \"I chucked most of it up, and the rest is settling all right.\" He fingered the blue ribbon pinned proudly to his T-shirt. \"Mr. Tucker\u0027s going to win.\"\\n\\n \"Is that right?\"\\n\\n \"Always does. He can move real quick when he\u0027s a mind to.\" He let out a whoop with the rest of the crowd. \"Here they go!\"\\n\\n The shouts and laughter from the onlookers were as wild as the squeaks from the pigs and the curses from the men pursuing them. As an extra incentive, the ground had been watered and churned to mud. Men slipped and sloshed in it, belly-flopped and back-flipped. Pigs squirted out of questing hands.\\n\\n \"Oh, why don\u0027t I have a camera?\" Caroline let out a crow of laughter when Tucker skidded on his backside. He twisted when a pig raced across his knees, but came up empty.\\n\\n \"That FBI doctor\u0027s good!\" Cy shouted, cheering when Teddy tackled a pig and nearly held on. \"Might\u0027ve had it if Bobby Lee hadn\u0027t tripped over him. Mr. Tucker\u0027s going for the big one. Come on, Mr. Tucker! Haul \u0027em up!\"\\n\\n \"An interesting contest,\" Burns said as he stopped beside them. \"I suppose dignity is sacrificed for the thrill of the hunt.\"\\n\\n Caroline nearly shot him an impatient look, but she didn\u0027t want to miss anything. \"You\u0027re keeping your dignity, I see.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t see the point in wallowing in mud and chasing pigs.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t. It\u0027s called fun.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I agree. In fact, I\u0027ve never been more entertained.\" He smiled down at Tucker, who was currently sprawled facefirst in the dirt. \"Longstreet looks quite natural, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what I think,\" she began, but Cy grabbed her arm.\\n\\n \"Look! He\u0027s got him! He\u0027s got him, Miss Caroline.\"\\n\\n And there was Tucker, slicked with mud and grease, holding a squirming pig over his head. When he grinned up at Caroline, she wished she\u0027d had a dozen roses to throw.\\n\\n No spangle-suited matador had ever looked more charming.\\n\\n \" \u0027To the victor go the spoils,\u0027 \" Burns noted. \"Tell me, does he get to keep the pig?\"\\n\\n Caroline tucked her tongue in her cheek. \"Until the butchering and pot luck supper next winter. Excuse me. I want to go congratulate the winner.\"\\n\\n \"One moment.\" He blocked her way. \"Are you still staying at Sweetwater?\"\\n\\n \"For the time being.\"\\n\\n \"You might want to reconsider. It isn\u0027t wise sleeping under the same roof with a murderer.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n Burns glanced over to where Dwayne and Tucker were washing down mud with a beer. \"Perhaps you should ask your host. I can tell you that I\u0027ll be making an arrest tomorrow, and the Longstreets won\u0027t have much to cheer about. Enjoy the rest of the festivities.\"\\n\\n Saying nothing, Caroline latched on to Cy and pushed by him.\\n\\n \"What did he mean, Miss Caroline?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027m going to find out.\" By the time she\u0027d worked her way through the crowd, Tucker was gone. \"Where did he go?\"\\n\\n \"He probably went down to McGreedy\u0027s to hose off with the others. Most everybody\u0027ll be packing up to go down to Sweetwater for picnics before the fireworks. They\u0027ll be opening the carnival, too.\"\\n\\n Frustrated, Caroline stopped. She couldn\u0027t talk to him surrounded by a bunch of wet, back-slapping men. She needed him alone. Rising on her toes, she scanned heads and faces. \"There\u0027s Delia. Why don\u0027t you catch up with her, ride back to Sweetwater? I\u0027ll wait for Tucker.\"\\n\\n \"No\u0027m. Mr. Tucker said I was to stay with you when he wasn\u0027t around.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not necessary, Cy. I don\u0027t...\" A look at the boy\u0027s set jaw and she swallowed a sigh. \"All right, then. We\u0027ll park ourselves somewhere and wait.\"\\n\\n Sitting on the stoop in front of Larsson\u0027s, they watched the exodus from town.\\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t let that FBI man worry you, Miss Caroline.\"\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m just concerned.\"\\n\\n Cy tugged his ribbon around so he could read it again. \"He\u0027s like Vernon.\"\\n\\n Surprised, Caroline turned to study Cy. \"Agent Burns is like your brother?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mean he goes around starting fights or hitting women. But he thinks he\u0027s smarter and better than everyone else. Figures his way\u0027s the only way. And he likes having his foot on your throat.\"\\n\\n Caroline rested her chin on her hand and considered. Burns would detest the comparison, but it was eerily apt. With Vernon it was Scripture-his interpretation. With Burns it was the law-his interpretation. In either case it was the using of something right and just for personal power.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re the ones who lose in the end.\" She thought of her mother as well, a great wielder of power, a master of carving out her own will. \"Because no one who doesn\u0027t have to stays with them. That\u0027s sad. It\u0027s better if people care about you even if you aren\u0027t always smarter, even if you aren\u0027t always sure you\u0027re right.\" She stood. Tucker was strolling down the street, his shirt flung over his shoulder, his hair dripping, his jeans soaking wet. \"Looks like we\u0027re going home.\"\\n\\n She crossed the street to slip her arms around him. Laughing, he tried to nudge her back. \"Honey, I\u0027m not as clean as I might be.\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t matter.\" She turned her head to murmur in his ear. \"I need to talk to you. Alone.\"\\n\\n He would have liked to have interpreted the demand as romantic, but he heard the tension, felt the nerves in the line of her body.\\n\\n \"All right. Soon as we can.\" He kept one arm around her as they began to walk. \"Let\u0027s get a move on, Cy. I heard Delia\u0027s cooked up a regular feast. Probably baked a few pies, too.\"\\n\\n Cy grinned good-naturedly. \"I ain\u0027t looking at another pie till next Fourth of July.\"\\n\\n \"Got to keep in practice, boy.\" Tucker flipped a finger down the boy\u0027s blue ribbon. \"You know why I\u0027m so good at latching on to those slippery critters?\" He swung Caroline off her feet. \" \u0027Cause I\u0027m always grabbing some wriggly female.\"\\n\\n Caroline relaxed enough to smile. \"Are you comparing me with a sow?\"\\n\\n \"Why, no, indeed, darlin\u0027. I\u0027m just saying if a man puts his mind to it, he can keep what he wants from slipping out of his hold.\"\\n\\n Back at Sweetwater, there were blankets spread on the grass, and the calliope was piping its siren song from over in Eustis Field. Near the pond where death had so recently floated, music twanged out from a fiddle, a banjo, and a guitar.\\n\\n Here and there exhausted children napped, many of them sprawled where they\u0027d dropped. An impromptu Softball game was under way, and now and then the crack of the bat set up a cheer. Old men sat in folding chairs to root and gossip and wish for strong, young legs that could pump toward home. Young people drifted toward the carnival, where the rides were half price until six.\\n\\n \"Is it like this every year?\" Caroline asked. She was close enough to the music to appreciate, far enough from the carnival not to dwell on how tawdry it looked in the daylight.\\n\\n \"Just about.\" Tucker lay on his back, debating if he had room for one more drumstick. \"What do you usually do on the Fourth?\"\\n\\n \"It depends. If I\u0027m out of the country, the day goes by like any other. When I\u0027m in the States, we usually tie the concert to a fireworks display.\" The fiddler took up \"Little Brown Jug,\" and Caroline began playing it in her head. \"Tucker, I have to ask you about something Matthew said to me earlier.\"\\n\\n The agent\u0027s name had Tucker deciding against another drumstick. \"I should have figured he\u0027d find a way to ruin things.\"\\n\\n \"He said he was going to make an arrest tomorrow.\"\\n\\n She closed her hand over his. \"Tucker, are you in trouble?\"\\n\\n He shut his eyes briefly, then rolled, folding his legs under him to sit. \"It\u0027s Dwayne, Caro.\"\\n\\n \"Dwayne?\" Stunned, she shook her head. \"He\u0027s going to arrest Dwayne?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that he can,\" Tucker said slowly. \"The lawyer thinks Burns is blustering, that maybe he was trying to get Dwayne to say something he shouldn\u0027t. All he\u0027s got is speculation. No physical evidence.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of speculation?\"\\n\\n \"He can put Dwayne in the same area as the killings, without any alibis so far. And he\u0027s using Dwayne\u0027s trouble with Sissy as a kind of motive.\"\\n\\n \"Divorce as a motive for killing other women?\" Caroline arched her brows. \"That gives about half the adult male population of the country a motive.\"\\n\\n \"Seems pretty thin, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Then why do you look so worried?\"\\n\\n \"Because Burns may be a first-class asshole, but he\u0027s not stupid. He knows Dwayne drinks, he knows how he was embarrassed by Sissy. And he knows Dwayne had an acquaintance with the victims. The one up in Nashville\u0027s the kicker.\"\\n\\n \"Nashville?\" Letting out a long breath, she nodded. \"Tell me.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d hoped to keep it all from her for at least one day. But once he began, the words streamed out. Under them, she could sense the anger and a very real fear.\\n\\n \"What did your lawyer advise?\"\\n\\n \"That we just go on as usual. Wait and see. Of course, if Dwayne could come up with an alibi for one of the nights, that would cool things off.\" He popped open a beer, frowned into it. \"I got a call in to the governor. He\u0027s a little hard to reach today, but I expect he\u0027ll call me back tomorrow.\"\\n\\n She tried a smile, hoping to coax one from Tucker. \"He\u0027s a cousin, I suppose?\"\\n\\n \"The governor?\" He did smile, fleetingly. \"No. But his wife is. Odds are Burns is going to need a lot more to put the cuffs on Dwayne.\"\\n\\n \"I can talk to my father if you like. He\u0027s corporate, but he knows some excellent criminal attorneys.\"\\n\\n Tucker tilted back the beer. \"Let\u0027s hope I don\u0027t have to take you up on it. The worst of it is, Caro, Dwayne\u0027s so scared he\u0027s doubting himself.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s worried that maybe when he was drunk, when he wasn\u0027t thinking straight, he might have-\"\\n\\n Her heartbeat skipped. \"My God, Tucker, you don\u0027t think-\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t,\" he said with a barely restrained fury. \"Jesus, Caroline, Dwayne\u0027s harmless as a puppy. He may flap around and scuffle when he\u0027s drunk, but he hurts only himself. And think,\" he added, because he had been, and he\u0027d been thinking hard. \"The way those women were killed. It was vicious, yeah. And sort of primal and wild, but it was also planned. Thought out clean and clever. A man\u0027s not clever with a head full of whiskey. He gets sloppy and stupid.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to convince me, Tucker,\" she said quietly. But she wondered if he was trying to convince himself.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s my brother.\" For Tucker, that said it all. He could see Dwayne now, sitting with old Mr. O\u0027Hara. Tucker figured the jug they were passing was of O\u0027Hara\u0027s own brew. And it wasn\u0027t lemonade. \"He\u0027ll be drunk as a skunk before nightfall. I haven\u0027t got the heart to cut him off.\"\\n\\n \"Sooner or later you\u0027ll have to, won\u0027t you?\" She put a hand on his cheek. \"Otherwise, you\u0027ll just be cutting him out. I\u0027ve been thinking about what you said about families. Not just about taking a stand, but about making things right. I\u0027m going to call my mother.\"\\n\\n \"I guess what you\u0027re telling me is, if my advice is good enough for you, it ought to be good enough for me.\"\\n\\n She smiled. \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n With a nod, he looked back toward Dwayne. \"There\u0027s a place up in Memphis. It has a good reputation for helping people shake themselves loose of the bottle.\\n\\n I think if I work it right, I could talk him into giving it a try.\"\\n\\n \"Darling,\" she said, easing into a delta drawl, \"with your talent you could talk a starving man out of his last crust of bread.\"\\n\\n \"That so?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s so.\"\\n\\n He leaned over to touch his lips to hers. \"That being the case, maybe I could talk you into doing something for me. Something I\u0027ve had a hankering for.\"\\n\\n Caroline thought of the cool, empty house behind them, of the big canopied bed. \"I imagine you could persuade me.\" More than willing, she melted into the kiss. \"What did you have in mind?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you see, I\u0027ve had this craving.\" He turned his head to nip at her ear.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m delighted to hear it.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to offend you.\"\\n\\n She chuckled against his throat. \"Please do.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you might be a little shy, doing it out here in front of all these people.\"\\n\\n \"I can-what?\" With a half laugh, she pulled away. \"Do what in front of all these people?\"\\n\\n \"Why, play a few tunes, darlin\u0027.\" His lips curved. \"What did you think I was talking about?\" As his smile spread wickedly, he lifted a brow. \"Why, Caroline, I\u0027m going to start thinking you have a one-track mind.\"\\n\\n \"Yours certainly takes some interesting curves.\" Blowing out a breath, she combed fingers through her hair. \"You want me to play?\"\\n\\n \"Probably nearly as much as you\u0027d like to be playing.\"\\n\\n She started to speak, then stopped and shook her head. \"You\u0027re right. I would like to.\"\\n\\n Tucker gave her a quick kiss. \"I\u0027ll go fetch your fiddle.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence/page-29.html","bookId":2411,"book":{"id":2411,"title":"Carnal Innocence","description":"Storyline: In the small town of Innocence, Mississippi, days are long, nights are fragrant, and secrets are hard to keep.
