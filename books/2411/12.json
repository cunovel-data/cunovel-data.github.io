{"id":75147,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"In the county jail in Greenville with its scarred, ringless toilet and graffiti-laced walls, Austin Hatinger sat on a board-hard bunk and stared at the bars of sunlight on the floor near his feet.\n He knew why he was in a cell, like a common criminal, like an animal. He knew why he was forced to stare at bars, in a cage with filthy sayings painted on the sweaty walls.\n It was because Beau Longstreet had been rich. He\u0027d been a God-cursing rich planter and had tossed all his tainted money to his bastard children.\n They were bastards, sure enough, Austin thought. Madeline might have worn that traitor\u0027s ring on her finger, but in the eyes of God, she had belonged to only one man.\n Beau hadn\u0027t gone off to the stinking hole of Korea to serve his country and save good Christians from the Yellow Peril, but had stayed behind, in sin and comfort, to make more money. Austin had long suspected that Beau had tricked Madeline into marriage. Not that that excused her betrayal, but women were weak-weak of body, weak of will, weak of mind.\n Without a strong guiding force-and the occasional back of the hand-they were prone to foolish behavior and to sin. God was his Witness that he\u0027d done his best to keep Mavis on a straight path.\n He\u0027d married her in a blindness of despair, trapped by his own raging lust. \"The woman thou gavest me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\" Oh, yes, Mavis had tempted him, and, weak of flesh, he had succumbed.\n Austin knew that from Eve down, Satan spoke first to women in his smooth, seductive voice. They being more open to sin, they fell and with a wily heart took a man down with them.\n But he\u0027d been faithful to her. Only once in thirty-five years had he turned to another woman.\n If there were times when, exercising his marital rights, plunging into Mavis, he felt, tasted, smelled Madeline in the dark, it was only the Lord\u0027s way of reminding him what had belonged to him.\n Madeline had pretended to be indifferent to him. He\u0027d known, all those years ago he\u0027d known, that she\u0027d gone with Beau only to tease and torment him, as women did. She\u0027d belonged to him. Only him. Her shocked denial when he\u0027d made his declaration before shipping out to war had only been another pretense.\n If it hadn\u0027t been for Beau, she\u0027d have been waiting for him when he\u0027d returned. That had been the beginning of the end for him.\n Hadn\u0027t he worked his fingers raw, broken his back, sweated out his heart trying to make a decent life for the family he\u0027d taken? And while he\u0027d worked, and failed, sweated and lost ground, Beau had sat up in his fine white house and laughed.\n And laughed.\n But Beau hadn\u0027t known. Despite all his money and his fine clothes and fancy cars, he\u0027d never known that once, on a dusty day in high summer, when the air was thick and still, when the sky was baked white with heat, Austin Hatinger had taken what was his.\n He remembered still how she\u0027d looked that day. And the picture in his mind was so clear, his hands trembled and his blood pumped hard and hot.\n She\u0027d come to him, carrying a basket up to his porch, a big straw basket filled with charity for him, for his squawling son, for his wife who lay inside, sweating through the birthing of another child.\n She\u0027d been wearing a blue dress and a white hat that had a filmy blue scarf trailing from the crown. Madeline had always been one for floating scarves. Her dark hair was curled under the hat so that it framed the creamy skin of her face-skin she could pamper with the lotions Beau\u0027s godless money could buy.\n She\u0027d looked like a spring morning, strolling up the dirt path to his sagging porch, her eyes soft and smiling, as if she didn\u0027t see the poverty, the broken cinder-block steps, the dingy clothes hanging on the line, the scrawny chickens pecking in the dust.\n Her voice had been so cool as she\u0027d offered him that basket filled with cast-off clothes Beau\u0027s money had bought for the babies he\u0027d planted in Austin\u0027s woman. He couldn\u0027t hear past it, to the weak whine of his own wife calling to him that it was time to fetch the doctor.\n He remembered how Madeline had started to go in, concerned for the woman who would never have laid in his bed at all if it hadn\u0027t been for betrayal and deceit.\n \"You fetch the doctor, Austin,\" she had said in that cool, spring-water voice. The kindness in her golden eyes burned a hole in his gut. \"Hurry and fetch him, and I\u0027ll stay with her and your little one.\"\n It wasn\u0027t madness that had gripped him. No, Austin would never accept that. It was righteousness. Right and wrath had filled him when he had dragged Madeline off the porch. Truth had pounded through him when he had pulled her down to the dirt.\n Oh, she\u0027d pretended that she didn\u0027t want him. She\u0027d screamed and she\u0027d fought, but it had all been a lie. He\u0027d had the right, the God-given right to push himself into her. No matter that she\u0027d worn a mask that had wept and pleaded, she\u0027d recognized that right.\n He\u0027d emptied his seed into her, and all these years later, he could still remember the power of that release. The way his body had bucked and shuddered as the part of him that was a man flowed into her.\n She\u0027d stopped her weeping. While he\u0027d rolled over in the dirt to stare up at that white sky, she had gotten up, gone away, and left him with the sound of triumph in his ears and the taste of bitterness on his tongue.\n So he\u0027d waited, day after day, night after night, for Beau to come. His second son had been born and his wife lay stony-faced in the bed, and Austin waited, his Winchester loaded and ready. And he\u0027d ached with the need to kill.\n But Beau had never come. He knew then that Madeline had kept their secret. And had doomed him.\n Now Beau was dead. And Madeline. They were buried together in Blessed Peace Cemetery.\n It was the son now, the son who had brought the circle twisting back. From generation to generation, he thought. The son had seduced and defiled his daughter. The girl was dead.\n Retribution was his right. Retribution was his sword.\n Austin blinked and focused on the bars of light again. Bars that came through bars. They had shifted with oncoming dusk. He\u0027d been sitting in the past for more than two hours.\n It was time to plan for today. In disgust he stared down at his loose blue pants. Prison clothes. He would be rid of them soon. He would get out. The Lord helped those who helped themselves, and he would find a way.\n He would make his way back to Innocence and do what he should have done more than thirty years ago. He would kill the part of Beau that lived in his son.\n And balance the scales.\n Caroline stepped out onto the flower-decked patio and inhaled deeply of summer. The light was gentling, easing quietly toward dusk, and insects stirred in the grass. She had that smug, too-full feeling she\u0027d forgotten could be so pleasant.\n The meal had been more than platters of food served on old silver trays. It had been a slow, almost languorous pocket of time filled with scents and tastes and talk. Teddy had done magic tricks with his napkin and the flatware. Dwayne, passably sober, had displayed a remarkable talent for mimicry, moving from old standards like Jimmy Stewart to Jack Nicholson and on to locals like Junior Talbot.\n Tucker and Josie had kept her laughing with rambling, often graphic stories of sex scandals, most of which were fifty or sixty years old.\n So different, she thought now, from her own family dinners, where her mother would dictate the proper conversation and not a drop would spill on the starched damask cloth. Those dinners had been so stifling and lifeless-more like a corporate meeting than a family meal. The peccadilloes of ancestors would never have been discussed, nor would Georgia McNair Waverly have found it amusing to have a guest pluck a salad fork out of her bodice.\n No indeed.\n But Caroline had enjoyed the evening more than any she could remember, and was sorry it was nearly over.\n \"You look happy,\" Tucker commented.\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t I be?\"\n \"It\u0027s just nice to see, that\u0027s all.\" He took her hand, and what he felt when his fingers linked with hers was not so much resistance as uncertainty. \"Want to walk?\"\n It was a pretty evening, a lovely spot, and her mood was mellow. \"All right.\"\n It wasn\u0027t really a walk, she thought as she wound through rosebushes and the heavy scent of gardenia. It was more of a meander. No hurry, no destination, no problems. She thought meander suited Tucker perfectly.\n \"Is that a lake?\" she asked as she saw the glint of water in the last light of the sun.\n \"Sweetwater.\" Obligingly he shifted directions. \"Beau built his house there, on the south side of it. You can still see what\u0027s left of the foundation.\"\n What Caroline saw was a scattering of stones. \"What a view they had. Acres and acres of their own land. How does that feel?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. It just is.\"\n Dissatisfied, she looked out over the wide, flat fields of cotton. She was a child of the city, where even the wealthy held only squares of property and people crowded each other for space. \"But to have all this...\"\n \"It has you.\" It surprised him to say it, but he shrugged and finished the thought. \"You can\u0027t turn away from it, not when it\u0027s been handed down to you. You can\u0027t see it go fallow when you\u0027re reminded that the Longstreets have held Sweetwater for the best part of two centuries.\"\n \"Is that what you want? To turn away?\"\n \"Maybe there are some places I\u0027d like to see.\" His shoulders moved again with a restlessness she recognized and hadn\u0027t expected. \"Then again, traveling\u0027s complicated. It takes a lot of effort.\"\n \"Don\u0027t do that.\"\n The impatience in her voice nearly made him smile. \"I haven\u0027t done anything yet.\" He skimmed a hand up her arm. \"But I\u0027m thinking about it.\"\n Frustrated, she broke away. \"You know what I mean. One minute you act as though there might be something inside your mind other than a thought for the easiest way out. The next thing, you shut it off.\"\n \"I never could see the point in taking the hard way.\"\n \"What about the right way?\"\n It wasn\u0027t often he came across a woman who wanted to discuss philosophy. Taking out a cigarette, Tucker settled into the conversation comfortably. \"Well, what\u0027s right for one isn\u0027t necessarily right for the other. Dwayne went off and got a degree he\u0027s never done a damn thing with, because he\u0027d rather sit around and brood about how things should have been. Josie runs off and gets married, twice, flies off to anywhere at the drop of a hat, and always ends up back here pretending things are better than they can be.\"\n \"What about you? What\u0027s your way?\"\n \"My way\u0027s to take it as it comes. And yours...\" He glanced back at her. \"Yours is to figure out what\u0027s coming before it gets here. That doesn\u0027t make either of us wrong.\"\n \"But if you figure it out, and it\u0027s not the way you want it, you can change it.\"\n \"You can try,\" he agreed. \" \u0027There\u0027s a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.\u0027 \" He inhaled smoke. \"Hamlet.\"\n Caroline could only stare. He was the last man on earth she\u0027d have expected to hear quoting Shakespeare.\n \"You take that field there.\" He put a companionable arm around her shoulders as he turned her. \"Now, that cotton-all things being equal-is going to grow. That topsoil\u0027s better than a foot deep and full of fertilizer. We spray off the goddamn weevils and when summer\u0027s gone it\u0027ll be harvested, bailed, trucked, and sold. And my worrying myself sick about whether all those things are gonna happen won\u0027t help the situation one bit. Besides, I\u0027ve got an overseer to do the worrying.\"\n \"There has to be more to it than that-\" she began.\n \"We\u0027re taking this down to the basics, Caro. It gets planted, it gets harvested, and somewhere along the line it ends up in a pretty dress like the one you\u0027re wearing tonight. Sure, I could sit up nights worrying whether we\u0027re going to get enough rain, or too much rain. Whether the truckers are going on strike, or those dimwits up in Washington are going to fuck up again and shuck us into a depression. Or I can get myself a good night\u0027s sleep. The results would be exactly the same.\"\n With a half laugh, she turned to him. \"Why does that make sense?\" She shook her head. \"There has to be a flaw in that logic.\"\n \"You let me know if you figure it out, but I think it holds solid. Let me give you another example. You won\u0027t let me kiss you because you\u0027re worried you might like it too much.\"\n Her brows shot up. \"That\u0027s incredibly egocentric. The reason could very well be that I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t like it at all.\"\n \"Either way,\" Tucker said agreeably as his arms slid around her waist. \"You\u0027re trying to figure out the answer before there\u0027s a problem. That\u0027s the kind of thing that brings on headaches.\"\n \"Really?\" Her voice was dry, and she kept her arms at her sides.\n \"Trust me, Caroline, I\u0027ve made a study on it. It\u0027s like standing on the edge of a swimming hole, worrying about the water being too cold. You\u0027d be better off if somebody put a foot to your butt and pushed you in.\"\n \"Is that what you\u0027re doing?\"\n His lips quirked in a grin. \"I could tell you I was doing it for you, so you\u0027d just fall in and stop thinking about the what-ifs. But the truth is-\" He lowered his head. Something twisted inside her when his warm breath fluttered over her lips. \"Thinking about this is keeping me up at night.\" He gave her chin a playful nip. \"And I need my sleep.\"\n Her body was stiff as his lips, light as moth wings, cruised over hers. Practiced seduction, she told herself as her heart began to thud. She hadn\u0027t forgotten how clever some men were at exploiting a woman\u0027s needs.\n \"You can kiss me back if you want to,\" Tucker murmured against her mouth. \"If you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll just please myself.\"\n First, he indulged in a lazy journey of her face, lips tracing along her temples, over her closed lids, down her cheeks. The gentleness in him was too ingrained for him to heed the urgency growing inside him to rush and take. Instead, he concentrated on her first faint shiver, on that gradual, glorious softening of her body against his. On the quickening of her breath as he slowly, quietly, brought his mouth back to hers.\n And oh, it was nice, so nice, to feel that slow, female yielding, to hear that quick hitch of her breath, to smell her over the scent of water and shadows as he eased them both into the kiss.\n This time her lips parted at the first touch. As he increased the pressure, degree by tormenting degree, her hands shot up to grip his arms. His last coherent thought was that the water wasn\u0027t cold, but it was a hell of a lot deeper than he\u0027d expected.\n She couldn\u0027t think at all, not with this steady roaring in her ears. She had grabbed him for balance, but no matter how desperately she clung, the world kept spinning. Caution had gone up in smoke. With a quick, helpless moan, she dived into the kiss.\n His mouth drank and drew from hers. But it wasn\u0027t enough. The taste was hot, honeyed, and he craved more. Tongue and teeth drove the kiss into greater intimacies. Still he ached.\n He wasn\u0027t supposed to ache over a kiss. His head wasn\u0027t supposed to swim when she locked herself around him. He wasn\u0027t supposed to tremble when she moaned out his name.\n He knew what it was to want a woman. It was a natural, pleasurable part of being a man. It didn\u0027t rip at you or carve a hole in your gut. It didn\u0027t make your knees shake until you were afraid you\u0027d fall down on them and beg.\n He felt himself teeter on some high, thin edge. Self-preservation had him windmilling his arms and stumbling back before he could fall. Carefully, he put his hands on her shoulders and drew her away. His brow rested weakly against hers while he struggled to catch his breath.\n Caroline let her unsteady hands stay at his hips. Gradually, through the mist of sensation, she forced her thoughts to surface and hold. It had simply been too long since she\u0027d felt the comfort of an embrace, or tasted genuine desire on a man\u0027s lips. Those were reasons enough to excuse losing herself for a moment.\n But she was back now. The blood was no longer pounding in her head. She could hear the whirl and click of insects, the croak of frogs. The sweet three-note call of a whippoorwill.\n The light was shadowed, caught in that final magic moment between day and night. Already day was losing, ebbing away, and taking the passionate heat with it.\n \"I guess we both could\u0027ve been wrong,\" Tucker said.\n \"About what?\"\n \"You figuring you wouldn\u0027t care for it, and me thinking that once I\u0027d kissed you, I\u0027d sleep better.\" On a long breath, he lifted his head. \"I gotta tell you, Caroline, wanting a woman\u0027s always been a pleasure for me. Since I was fifteen and Laureen O\u0027Hara and I wrestled off each other\u0027s clothes in her daddy\u0027s barn. You\u0027re the first woman I\u0027ve come across since that monumental day who\u0027s complicated that pleasure.\"\n She wanted to believe him, wanted to believe that what he\u0027d felt here was more difficult, more intimate, more dangerous than anything he\u0027d felt before. And because she did believe him, she was frightened enough to shake him off.\n \"I think it would be best if we left it alone.\"\n His gaze flicked down to her lips, swollen and soft from his. \"In a pig\u0027s eyes,\" he said mildly.\n \"I mean it, Tucker.\" A trace of desperation crept into her voice. \"I\u0027ve just ended a destructive relationship and have no intention of starting another. And you... your life certainly has enough complications at the moment without adding another.\"\n \"Normally I might agree with that. You know, your hair looks just like a halo in this light. Maybe I want a shot at redemption. The angel and the sinner. Christ knows, there\u0027s just about that much difference between us.\"\n \"That\u0027s the most ridiculous-\"\n His hand shot out quickly, so quickly she swallowed the rest of her words as it fisted into her hair. This time when he spoke, the mild tone was lined with steel. \"Something about you, Caroline. I don\u0027t know what the hell it is, but it eats at me at the oddest times. There\u0027s usually a good reason for a reaction like that. I figure it\u0027ll come out sometime.\"\n \"My time doesn\u0027t flow the way yours does, Tucker.\" She thought her voice was admirably calm, particularly when her heart was thudding in her throat. \"In a few months I\u0027ll be in Europe. A quick affair to pass a hot summer isn\u0027t in my plans.\"\n The ghost of a smile lit his mouth. \"You do make plans. I\u0027ve noticed that about you.\" He stepped forward and crushed her lips under his in a hard, brief kiss that rocked her back on her heels. \"I\u0027m going to have you, Caroline. Sooner or later we\u0027re going to have the hell out of each other. I\u0027ll try to leave the timing up to you.\"\n \"That\u0027s the most outrageously arrogant, despicably male statement I\u0027ve ever heard.\"\n \"Depends on your point of view,\" he said affably. \"I meant it as fair warning. But I don\u0027t want to get you so riled up it spoils your digestion.\" Clamping his hand over hers, he started back toward the house. Lightning bugs were glinting and dancing in the growing dark. \"Why don\u0027t we sit on the porch awhile?\"\n \"I have no intention of sitting anywhere with you.\"\n \"Now, honey, you talk like that, I\u0027m going to think you find me irresistible.\"\n Her quick hoot of laughter made him grin. \"The day I can\u0027t resist some self-styled delta Don Juan-\"\n He gave a hoot of his own and scooped her off her feet to swing her in a circle. \"I\u0027m crazy about that sassy mouth of yours.\" He gave it an enthusiastic kiss. \"I bet you went to one of those fancy finishing schools in Switzerland.\"\n \"I did not, and put me down.\" She squirmed for a minute. \"I mean it, Tucker. Someone\u0027s coming.\"\n He didn\u0027t put her down, but he did look across the lawn. A pair of headlights were coming fast. \"I guess we\u0027ll just mosey on over and see who\u0027s calling.\"\n He carried her to the drive as much to fluster her as for the pleasure of having that long, slim body cupped in his arms. And he figured once she got over being irritated by it, she\u0027d see the romance.\n \"First star\u0027s out,\" he said conversationally, and she made a sound suspiciously like a growl.\n \"You know, you don\u0027t weigh much more than a sack full of flour. Feel a lot nicer though.\"\n \"The man\u0027s a poet,\" Caroline said between her teeth, and wished she didn\u0027t see the humor of it.\n He couldn\u0027t resist. \" \u0027Fair as a star, when only one is shining in the sky.\u0027 \" He sent her a smile. \"I guess Wordsworth said it better, huh?\"\n Before she could think of a proper response, he set her on her feet, gave her bottom a friendly pat, then waved at Bobby Lee, who was scrambling out of his rusting Cutlass.\n \"Hey, boy, shouldn\u0027t you be out sparking Marvella?\"\n \"Tucker.\" Bobby Lee pushed a hand through his drooping pompadour. In the headlights he\u0027d neglected to turn off, his face was pale with fear or excitement. \"I rode on out as soon as I finished.\" He nodded belatedly to Caroline. \"Evening, Miz Waverly.\"\n \"Hello, Bobby Lee. If you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027d like to thank Delia again for dinner before I leave.\"\n She hadn\u0027t even taken the first step when Tucker captured her hand. \"It\u0027s early yet. What brings you out?\" he asked Bobby Lee.\n \"Junior brought in your car this afternoon. Holy Jesus. It sure was a mess, Tucker.\"\n Tucker grimaced and touched fingers gingerly to his bandaged head. \"Yeah, it\u0027s a heartbreaker, all right. Barely had five thousand miles on her. Frame\u0027s bent, then?\"\n \"Well, yeah. Bent to shit- excuse me, ma\u0027am. We saw that soon as we had her up on the lift. We figured you\u0027d have to have her hauled down to Jackson, but seeing as we haven\u0027t had a real good wreck come through since Bucky Larsson creamed his Buick out on sixty-one during that ice storm last January, we wanted a look-see.\"\n Tucker settled his hip against the Cutlass. \"That Buick looked like it\u0027d been run over by a tank when you towed it in. Never could figure out how Bucky got off with only a broken collar bone and eighteen stitches.\"\n \"Gets a queer look in his eyes sometimes,\" Bobby Lee added. \" \u0027Course he always did, now that I think on it.\"\n Tucker nodded. \"His mama was spooked by a nest of copperheads when she was carrying him. Might have addled him.\"\n Caroline no longer felt the urge to leave. But she did have to resist the urge to cup her head in her hands and bray with laughter. \"You came all this way to tell Tucker his car\u0027s wrecked?\"\n The two men looked over at her with identical expressions of puzzlement. To them it was obvious Bobby Lee was only setting the stage for whatever he\u0027d come to say.\n \"No, ma\u0027am,\" he said politely. \"I come out to tell Tucker how his car come to be wrecked. Tucker here drives slick as spit. Everybody knows that.\"\n \"Thanks, Bobby Lee.\"\n \"Just telling it like it is. Well, the thing is, Junior mentioned as to how there wasn\u0027t no skid marks or nothing.\"\n \"Brakes were out.\"\n \"Yeah. He said. So I got to thinking, and when Junior\u0027s old lady kept calling, complaining how he\u0027d promised to take her and the baby on down to Greenville for spaghetti, I told him I\u0027d stay to watch the station. It\u0027s quiet on Sundays anyhow, so I figured I\u0027d take a look at those brakes for you.\"\n He pulled a piece of Double Bubble from his pocket, unwrapped it, and popped it into his mouth. \"I took a good look at the lines, and at the hydraulics for the power steering, too. Might not\u0027ve seen it if I hadn\u0027t been so curious. But I did.\"\n \"Seen what?\" Caroline demanded when Tucker seemed content to let the silence-hang.\n \"Holes poked through the lines. Not rotted or nothing like that, but poked through. Like with an awl, or maybe an ice pick. Fluid would\u0027ve dribbled on out. That\u0027s how your wheel seized up on you, see? You could\u0027ve wrestled with it if you\u0027da been expecting it, but coming up to a curve at a clip, well, the car\u0027s gonna keep going dead ahead. Then you hit the brakes and they\u0027re useless as tits on a bull. Beg your pardon, Miz Waverly.\"\n \"My God.\" Her fingers dug into Tucker\u0027s arm. \"Are you saying someone deliberately sabotaged the car? He could\u0027ve been killed.\"\n \"Could\u0027ve,\" Bobby Lee agreed. \"But more like busted up some. Everybody \u0027round here knows Tucker handles a car as good as those Formula One guys.\"\n \"I appreciate your coming down to tell me.\" Tucker flipped his cigarette away, his eyes following the arch of spark. He was angry, blood-pumping angry, and needed to sit on it awhile. \"You going by to see Marvella this evening?\"\n \"I was planning on it.\"\n \"Then you go on and tell the sheriff what you told me. But nobody else, hear? Don\u0027t tell anybody else.\"\n \"If that\u0027s the way you want it.\"\n \"For now. I\u0027d be obliged if we keep it just like that for now. Get on back to town before Marvella lays into you for being so late.\"\n \"Guess I will. Be seeing you, Tucker. Evening, Miz Waverly.\"\n Caroline didn\u0027t speak until the Cutlass\u0027s taillights winked off at the end of the drive. \"He could\u0027ve made a mistake. He\u0027s just a boy.\"\n \"He\u0027s one of the best mechanics in the county. Makes sense anyway. If I hadn\u0027t had my brains rattled, I\u0027d\u0027ve seen it myself. I just have to figure out who\u0027s riled enough to give me trouble.\"\n \"Trouble?\" Caroline echoed. \"Tucker, I don\u0027t care what Bobby Lee believes about your superhuman skill with a car, you might have been seriously hurt, even killed.\"\n \"You worried about me, sugar?\" Though his mind was working in other directions, he smiled and ran his hands up and down her arms. \"I like it.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be such a jerk.\"\n \"Now, don\u0027t get mad, Caro. Though God knows I like the look of you when you get heated up.\"\n Her voice chilled. \"I\u0027m not going to stand here while you pat me on the head and put me off like a helpless female. I\u0027m offering to help you.\"\n \"That\u0027s sweet of you. No-\" He grabbed her as she swore and swung away. \"I mean it. It\u0027s just that until I sift the whole thing through, there\u0027s nothing to help with.\"\n \"It\u0027s obvious to me that it had to be someone close to Edda Lou Hatinger.\" She tossed her head. \"Unless, of course, you\u0027ve got a list of jealous husbands you need to consider.\"\n \"I don\u0027t date married ladies. Except that once,\" he began, and caught her look. \"Never mind. Austin\u0027s in jail, and I can\u0027t picture poor old Mavis scooting under my car with an ice pick.\"\n Caroline angled her chin. \"She had brothers.\"\n \"True enough.\" Tucker\u0027s lips pursed as he considered. \"Vernon wouldn\u0027t know a crankshaft from a fence post. He\u0027s not the sly kind either. More open, like his daddy. And young Cy... there\u0027s no meanness in him that I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\n \"They could have hired someone.\"\n Tucker snorted. \"With what?\" Gently, he pressed his lips to her temple. \"Don\u0027t fret, honey, I\u0027m going to sleep on it.\"\n Staring, she stepped back. \"I think you could,\" she said slowly. \"I believe you could actually close your eyes and sleep like a baby, even after this.\"\n \"I already wrecked my car and banged my head,\" he pointed out. \"I don\u0027t see why whoever did this should have the pleasure of keeping me from sleeping, too.\" He got that look in his eye she was beginning to recognize. That gleam that sent off warning signals in her brain and flutters in her heart. \"The only thing keeping me up at night is you. Now, if we were to...\" He trailed off as another set of headlights bounced down the drive. \"Christ almighty, we\u0027re doing big business tonight.\"\n \"I\u0027m going now,\" Caroline said decisively. \"I\u0027ll call Delia tomorrow and thank her.\"\n \"Just hold on.\" He was trying to make out the type of car. All he could tell for sure was that its muffler had parted ways sometime before. The noise was enough to wake the dead. It was difficult to beheve that the sedate black Lincoln that came to a rocky stop in back of Caroline\u0027s BMW could be so rude.\n When the door opened and a small white-haired woman in a tie-dyed T-shirt, blue jeans, and army boots stepped out, Tucker broke into a hoot and a grin.\n \"Cousin Lulu.\"\n \"That you, Tucker?\" She had a voice like a freight train, loud and rattly and full of dust. \"What are you doing over there in the dark with that girl?\"\n \"Less than I\u0027d like to.\" He was beside Lulu in two strides, bending himself nearly in half to kiss her powdered, paper-thin cheek. \"Pretty as ever,\" he pronounced, and she giggled and swatted him.\n \"You\u0027re the pretty one. Look more like your ma than she did herself. You, you there.\" She signaled to Caroline with one bony finger. \"Come on over where I can see you.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you scare her off,\" Tucker warned. \"Cousin Lulu, this is Caroline Waverly.\"\n \"Waverly, Waverly. Not from these parts.\" She cast her bright bird\u0027s eyes up and down. \"Not your usual type either, Tucker. Doesn\u0027t look top-heavy or pin-headed.\"\n Caroline thought about it. \"Thank you.\"\n \"Yankee!\" Lulu set up a screech that could have shattered crystal. \"Christ in a sidecar, she\u0027s a Yankee.\"\n \"Only half,\" Tucker said quickly. \"She\u0027s Miss Edith\u0027s granddaughter.\"\n Lulu\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Edith McNair? George and Edith?\"\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" Caroline said with her tongue in her cheek. \"I\u0027m staying the summer in my grandparents\u0027 house.\"\n \"Dead, aren\u0027t they? Yes, they\u0027re dead, but they were Mississippians born and bred, so that counts for something. That your hair, girl, or a wig?\"\n \"My...\" Automatically, Caroline lifted a hand to her hair. \"It\u0027s my hair.\"\n \"Good. Don\u0027t trust bald-headed women any more than I trust Yankees. So we\u0027ll see. Tucker, you take my cases in and get me a brandy. I need you to call that Talbot boy about my car. Lost my muffler somewhere in Tennessee. Maybe it was Arkansas.\" She paused at the base of the steps. \"Well, come on, girl.\"\n \"I was... I was just leaving.\"\n \"Tucker, you tell that girl when I offer to have a brandy with a Yankee, that Yankee better drink.\"\n With that, Lulu clumped up the steps in her army boots.\n \"She\u0027s something, isn\u0027t she?\" Tucker asked as he switched off the purring ignition.\n \"Something,\" Caroline agreed, and decided she could use a brandy at that. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence/page-12.html","bookId":2411,"book":{"id":2411,"title":"Carnal Innocence","description":"Storyline: \n In the small town of Innocence, Mississippi, days are long, nights are fragrant, and secrets are hard to keep. But when a brutal killer starts claiming the lives of the town\u0027s most attractive women, lifelong neighbors are forced to wonder if the culprit is a stranger lurking in the bayou...or someone right next door. \n World-famous concert violinist Caroline Waverly knows nothing of the murders when she arrives in Innocence. Burned out from a childhood lost to endless rehearsals and an all-too-public breakup with the conductor who was her lover, Caroline is looking for a little peace and some time to think. She hopes that a stay at her late grandmother\u0027s house the one with a covered porch just made for soft summer nights will provide the tranquillity she needs. But Innocence has something else to offer Caroline: a man named Tucker Longstreet. \n Blessed with the Longstreet good looks, lazy charm, and family fortune, Tucker is a tall, cool drink of water and he knows it. He likes to keep his romances short and shallow. But one look at Caroline, and Tucker realizes that she is unlike any other woman he\u0027s met. Tightly coiled and coolly reserved, Caroline is determined to fight him off. She might be able to do a better job if she hadn\u0027t felt an unexpected thrill at his ardent advances...and if she hadn\u0027t been so scared after finding a third murder victim in the murky waters behind her home. \n For Caroline Waverly,a beautiful summer interlude could turn into much more or could stir a killer\u0027s crazed dreams. Because there\u0027s just one small problem with her new romance: Tucker is the leading suspect in the killings.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/carnal-innocence.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:48 AM"}}
