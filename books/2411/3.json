{"id":75138,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Dwayne Longstreet sat on the rock-iron bunk in one of the town\u0027s two jail cells and moaned like a wounded dog. The three aspirin he\u0027d downed had yet to take effect, and the army of chain saws buzzing inside his head were getting mighty close to the brain.\\n\\n He took his head out of his hands long enough to slurp down more of the coffee Burke had left him, then clamped it tight again, afraid it would fall off. Half hoping it would.\\n\\n As always, during the first hour after waking from a toot, Dwayne despised himself. He hated knowing that he\u0027d strolled, smiling, into the same ugly trap again.\\n\\n Not the drinking. No, Dwayne liked drinking. He liked that first hot taste of whiskey when it hit the tongue, slid down the throat, settled into the belly like a long, slow kiss from a pretty woman. He liked the friendly rush that spread into his head after the second drink.\\n\\n Hell, he fucking loved it.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t even mind getting drunk. No, there was something to be said about that floating time after you\u0027d knocked back five or six. When everything looked fine and funny. When you forgot your life had turned ugly on you-that you\u0027d lost the wife and kids you\u0027d never wanted much in the first place to some fucking shoe salesman, that you were stuck in a dusty pisshole of a town because there was no place else to go.\\n\\n Yeah, he liked that floaty, forgetful time just fine. He didn\u0027t particularly care for what happened after that. When your hand kept reaching for the bottle without warning the rest of you what was coming. When you stopped tasting and kept on swallowing just because the whiskey was there and so were you.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t like the fact that sometimes the drink turned him nasty, so he wanted to pick a fight, any fight. God knew he wasn\u0027t a mean-tempered man. That was his father. But sometimes, just sometimes, the whiskey turned him into Beau, and he was sorry for it.\\n\\n What scared him was that there were times when he couldn\u0027t quite remember if he\u0027d turned nasty or just passed out quietly. Whenever that happened, he was more than likely going to wake up in the cell with a hangover fit to kill.\\n\\n Gingerly, knowing that the movement could change the busy loggers in his head into a swarm of angry bees, he got to his feet. The sun streaming through the bars at the window all but blinded him. Dwayne shielded his eyes with the flat of his hand as he groped his way out of the cell. Burke never locked him in.\\n\\n Dwayne fumbled his way into the bathroom and whizzed out what felt like a gallon of the Wild Turkey that had filtered through his kidneys. Wishing miserably for his own bed, he splashed cold water in his face until his eyes stopped burning.\\n\\n He hissed through his teeth when the door slammed in the outer office, and whimpered just a little when Josie cheerfully called his name.\\n\\n \"Dwayne? Are you in here? It\u0027s your own sweet sister come to bust you out.\"\\n\\n When he stepped into the doorway to lean weakly on the jamb, Josie raised her carefully plucked brows. \"My oh my. You look like something three cats had to drag in.\" She stepped closer, tapping a bright red nail on her bottom lip. \"Honey, how do you see through all that blood in your eyes?\"\\n\\n \"Did I...\" He coughed to clear the rust out of his throat. \"Did I wreck a car?\"\\n\\n \"Not that I know of. Now, you come on along with Josie.\" She moved to him to take his arm. When he turned his head, she stepped back fast. \"Sweet Jesus. How many men have you killed with that breath?\" Clucking her tongue, she dug in her purse and pulled out a box of Tic Tacs. \"Here now, honey, you chew on a couple of these.\" She popped them into his mouth herself. \"Otherwise I\u0027m likely to faint if you breathe on me.\"\\n\\n \"Delia\u0027s going to be real pissed,\" he mumbled as he let Josie guide him to the door.\\n\\n \"I expect she will-but when she finds out about Tucker, she\u0027ll forget all about you.\"\\n\\n \"Tucker? Oh, shit.\" Dwayne staggered back as the sun slammed into his eyes.\\n\\n Shaking her head, Josie pulled out her sunglasses, the ones with the little rhinestones circling the lenses, and handed them to him. \"Tucker\u0027s in trouble. Or Edda Lou\u0027s claiming he got her in trouble. But we\u0027ll see about that.\"\\n\\n \"Christ almighty.\" For a brief moment his own problems faded away. \"Tuck got Edda Lou knocked up?\"\\n\\n Josie opened the passenger door of her car so Dwayne could pour himself in. \"She made a big scene over at the Chat \u0027N Chew, so everybody in town\u0027s going to be watching to see if her belly bloats.\"\\n\\n \"Christ almighty.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say this.\" Josie started the car, and was sympathetic enough to flick off the radio. \"Whether she\u0027s knocked up or not, he\u0027d better think twice before moving that whiny slut into the house.\" Dwayne would have agreed wholeheartedly, but he was too busy holding his head.\\n\\n Tucker knew better than to go back to the house. Delia would be on him in a New York minute. He needed some time alone, and once he drove through Sweetwater\u0027s gates, he wouldn\u0027t get any.\\n\\n On impulse he swerved to the side of the road, leaving a streak of rubber on the sweaty macadam. With home still the best part of a mile away, he left his car on the grassy verge and walked into the trees.\\n\\n The paralyzing heat lessened by a few stingy degrees once he was under the shelter of green leaves and dripping moss. Still, he wasn\u0027t looking to cool his skin, but his mind.\\n\\n For one moment back at the diner, for one hot, hazy-red moment, he\u0027d wanted to grab Edda Lou by the throat and squeeze every last accusing breath out of her.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t care for the impulse, or for the fact that he\u0027d taken an instant\u0027s sheer pleasure from the image. Half of what she\u0027d said had been lies. But that meant half of what she\u0027d said had been the truth.\\n\\n He shoved a low-hanging branch aside, ducked, and made his way through the heavy summer growth to the water. A heron, startled at the intrusion, folded up her long, graceful legs and glided off deeper into the bayou. Tucker kept an eye out for snakes as he settled down on a log.\\n\\n Taking his time, he pulled out a cigarette, pinched a miserly bit from the tip, then lighted it.\\n\\n He\u0027d always liked the water-not so much the pound and thrust of the ocean, but the still darkness of shady ponds, the murmur of streams, the steady pulse of the river. Even as a boy he\u0027d been drawn to it, using the excuse of fishing to sit and think, or sit and doze, listening to the plop of frogs and the monotonous drone of cicadas.\\n\\n He\u0027d had only childish problems to face then. Whether he was going to get skinned for that D in geography, how to finesse a new bike for Christmas. And later, whether he should ask Arnette or Carolanne to the Valentine\u0027s Day dance.\\n\\n As you got older, problems swelled. He remembered grieving for his father when the old man went and got himself killed in that Cessna traveling down to Jackson. But that had been nothing, nothing at all compared to the sharp, stunning misery he\u0027d felt when he found his mother crumpled in her garden, already too close to death for any doctor to fix her seizured heart.\\n\\n He\u0027d come here often then, to ease himself past the misery. And eventually, like all things, it had faded. Except at the odd moments when he\u0027d glance out a window, half expecting to see her-face shaded by that big straw hat with the chiffon scarf trailing-clipping overblown roses.\\n\\n Madeline Longstreet would not have approved of Edda Lou. She would, naturally, have found her coarse, cheap, and cunning. And, Tucker thought as he slowly drew in and expelled smoke, would have expressed her disapproval by that excruciating politeness any true southern lady could hone to a razor-edged weapon.\\n\\n His mother had been a true southern lady.\\n\\n Edda Lou, on the other hand, was a fine piece of work. Physically speaking. Big-breasted, wide-hipped, with skin she kept dewy by slathering on Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion every morning and night of her life. She had an eager, hardworking mouth, willing hands, and by God, he\u0027d enjoyed her.\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t loved her, nor had he claimed to. Tucker considered promises of love a cheap tool for persuading a woman into bed. He\u0027d shown her a good time, in bed and out. He wasn\u0027t a man to stop the courtship process once a woman had spread her legs.\\n\\n But the minute she\u0027d started hinting about marriage, he\u0027d taken a long step back. First he\u0027d given her a cooling-off period, taking her out maybe twice in a two-week period and cutting off sex completely. He\u0027d told her flat out that he had no intention of getting married. But he\u0027d seen by the smug look in her eye she hadn\u0027t believed him. So he\u0027d broken it off. She\u0027d been tearful but civilized. Tucker saw now that she\u0027d believed she\u0027d be able to reel him back.\\n\\n Tucker also had no doubt now that she\u0027d heard he\u0027d been seen with someone else.\\n\\n All of that mattered. And none of it mattered. If Edda Lou was pregnant, he was pretty sure that despite precautions-he was the one who\u0027d made her so. Now he had to figure out what to do about it.\\n\\n He was surprised Austin Hatinger hadn\u0027t already come looking for him with his shotgun loaded. Austin wasn\u0027t the most understanding of men, and he\u0027d never been fond of the Longstreets. The fact was, he hated them, and had ever since Madeline LaRue had chosen Beau Longstreet, ending forever Austin\u0027s blind dream of marrying her himself.\\n\\n Since then Austin had turned into one mean, hardbitten son of a bitch. It was common knowledge that he slapped his wife around when the mood was on him. He used the same thumping discipline with each of his five children-the oldest of which, A.J., was now serving time in Jackson for grand theft auto.\\n\\n Austin had spent a few nights behind bars himself. Assault, assault and battery, disorderly conduct-usually carried out while spouting scripture or calling on the Lord. Tucker figured it was only a matter of time before Austin came after him with that shotgun or those ham-sized fists.\\n\\n He\u0027d just have to deal with it.\\n\\n Just as he\u0027d have to deal with his responsibility to Edda Lou. Responsibility was what it was, and he\u0027d be damned if he\u0027d marry responsibility. She might have been skilled in bed, but she couldn\u0027t keep up her end of a conversation with a hydraulic jack. And, he\u0027d discovered, she was as small-brained and cunning as a she-fox. That was one thing he wasn\u0027t about to face over breakfast every morning for the rest of his life.\\n\\n He\u0027d do what he could, and what was right. There was money, and there was his time. That much he could give. And maybe, once the worst of the anger wore off, he\u0027d feel affection for the child, if not for the mother.\\n\\n He hoped there\u0027d be affection rather than this sick feeling in his gut.\\n\\n Tucker scrubbed his hands over his face and wished Edda Lou would just disappear. That she would pay for that ugly scene in the diner where she\u0027d made him look worse than he was. If he could just think of a way, he\u0027d...\\n\\n He heard a rustle in the leaves and swung toward it. If Edda Lou had followed him, she was going to find him not only ready to fight, but eager.\\n\\n When Caroline stepped into the clearing, she muffled a scream. There, in the shady spot where she\u0027d once fished with her grandfather, was a man, golden eyes hard as agate, fists clenched, mouth pulled back dangerously in something between a snarl and a sneer.\\n\\n She looked around desperately for a weapon, then realized she\u0027d have to depend on herself.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n Tucker shucked off the tough shell as quickly as he might have peeled off his shirt.\\n\\n \"Just watching the water.\" He flashed her a quick, self-deprecating smile that was supposed to signal he was harmless. \"I didn\u0027t expect to run across anyone.\"\\n\\n The taut and ready stance had relaxed into idleness. But Caroline was not convinced he was harmless. His voice was smooth, with that lazy drawl that could so easily be mocking. Though his eyes were smiling at her, there was such melting sexuality in them that she was ready to run if he so much as leaned toward her.\\n\\n \"Who are you?\"\\n\\n \"Tucker Longstreet, ma\u0027am. I live just down the road. I\u0027m trespassing.\" Again that \"don\u0027t worry about a thing\" smile. \"Sorry if I gave you a turn. Miss Edith didn\u0027t mind if I wandered in here to sit, so I didn\u0027t think to stop by the house and ask. You are Caroline Waverly?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" She found her own stiff answer rude in the face of his country manners. To soften it, she smiled, but didn\u0027t lose that reserved, tensed stance. \"You startled me, Mr. Longstreet.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, just make that Tucker.\" Smiling, he took her measure. A tad too thin, he thought, but she had a face as pale and elegant as the cameo his mama had worn on a black velvet ribbon. Usually he preferred long hair on a woman, but the short style suited her graceful neck and huge eyes. He tucked his thumbs in his pockets. \"We\u0027re neighbors, after all. We tend to be friendly \u0027round Innocence.\"\\n\\n This one, she thought, could charm the bark off a tree. She\u0027d known another like him. And whether the words were delivered in a southern drawl or a Spanish lilt, they were deadly.\\n\\n She nodded-regally, he thought.\\n\\n \"I was just taking a look around the property,\" she continued. \"I didn\u0027t expect to come across anyone.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a pretty spot. You settling in all right? If you need anything, all you have to do is holler.\"\\n\\n \"I appreciate that, but I think I can manage. I\u0027ve been here only an hour or so.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I passed you coming in, on my way to town.\"\\n\\n She started to come up with another bland response, then her eyes narrowed. \"In a red Porsche?\"\\n\\n This time his grin was slow and wide and devastating. \"She\u0027s a beauty, huh?\"\\n\\n It was Caroline who stepped forward, eyes hot. \"You irresponsible idiot, you must have been doing ninety.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d gone from being fragile and lovely to downright beautiful with that flush of heat in her cheeks. Tucker kept his thumbs in his pockets. He\u0027d always figured if you couldn\u0027t avoid a woman\u0027s temper, you might as well enjoy it.\\n\\n \"Nope. As I recollect, I was just coming up on eighty. Now, she\u0027ll do a hundred and twenty in a good straightaway, but-\"\\n\\n \"You almost hit me.\"\\n\\n He seemed to consider the possibility, then shook his head. \"No, I had plenty of time to swing around. Probably looked closer from your point of view, though. I sure am sorry for giving you a scare twice in the same day.\" But the glitter in his eyes had nothing to do with apology. \"Mostly I try to have a different effect on a pretty woman.\"\\n\\n If there was one thing Caroline\u0027s mother had pounded into her head, it was dignity. She caught herself before she could sputter. \"You have no business being on the road at all. I should report you to the police.\"\\n\\n All that Yankee indignation tickled him. \"Well, you can do that all right, ma\u0027am. You call into town and ask for Burke. That\u0027s Burke Truesdale. He\u0027s the sheriff.\"\\n\\n \"And your cousin, no doubt,\" she said between her teeth.\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am, though his baby sister did marry a second cousin of mine.\" If she assumed he was a southern rube, he\u0027d oblige. \"They moved across the river into Arkansas. My cousin? That\u0027s Billy Earl LaRue. He\u0027s on my mama\u0027s side. He and Meggie-that\u0027s Burke\u0027s baby sister-they run one of those storage places. You know, where people store furniture or cars or whatever by the month? Doing right well, too.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m delighted to hear it.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s neighborly of you.\" His smile was as slow and easy as the water beside him. \"You be sure to tell Burke I said hey when you talk to him.\"\\n\\n Though he was taller by several inches, Caroline managed to look down her nose at him. \"I think we both know it would do very little good. Now, I\u0027ll thank you to get off my property, Mr. Longstreet. And if you want to sit and watch the water again, find someplace else to do it.\"\\n\\n She turned and had taken two steps before Tucker\u0027s voice-and dammit, it was mocking-called out to her. \"Miz Waverly? Welcome to Innocence. Y\u0027all have a nice day now, you hear?\"\\n\\n She kept walking. And Tucker, being a prudent man, waited until he figured she was out of earshot before he started to laugh.\\n\\n If he weren\u0027t up to his neck in quicksand, he\u0027d enjoy teasing that pretty Yankee on a regular basis. Damn if she hadn\u0027t made him feel better.\\n\\n Edda Lou was primed and ready. She\u0027d been worried that she\u0027d botched things by going on a rampage after she heard Tucker had taken that bitch Chrissy Fuller over to Greenville to dinner and the movies. But for once, it seemed, her temper had worked in her favor. That scene in the diner, and her public humiliation of Tucker, had brought him around as surely as a brass ring through his nose.\\n\\n Oh, it could be that he\u0027d try to sweet-talk her into letting him off the hook. Tucker Longstreet had the smoothest tongue in Bolivar County. But he wasn\u0027t going to waggle himself loose with it this time. She was going to have a ring on her finger and a marriage license in her hand quick as a lick. She\u0027d wipe the smug look off every face in Innocence when she moved into the big house.\\n\\n And she, Edda Lou Hatinger, who\u0027d grown up on a dirt farm with dusty chickens squawking in the yard and the smell of pork grease forever in the kitchen, would wear fine clothes and sleep in a soft bed and drink French champagne for breakfast.\\n\\n She had a fondness for Tucker, and that was the truth. But she had more room in her thirsty heart for his house, his name, and his bank account. And when she swept into Innocence, she\u0027d do it in a long pink Caddy. There\u0027d be no more working the register at Larsson\u0027s, no more scraping pennies together so she could keep her room at the boardinghouse instead of living at home where her daddy would as soon smack her as look at her sideways.\\n\\n She\u0027d be a Longstreet.\\n\\n Weaving her fantasies, she pulled her rattletrap \u002775 Impala to the side of the road. She didn\u0027t question the fact that Tucker\u0027s note had asked her to meet him back at the pond. She found it sweet. Edda Lou had fallen in love-as much as her avaricious heart would allow-because Tucker was so downright romantic. He didn\u0027t grab and grope like some of those who sidled up to her at McGreedy\u0027s. He didn\u0027t always want to get right into her pants either, like most of the men she dated.\\n\\n No, Tucker liked to talk. And though half the time she didn\u0027t know what in the blue blazes he was talking about, still she appreciated the courtesy.\\n\\n And he was generous with presents. Bottles of perfume, bunches of posies. Once, when they\u0027d had a spat, she\u0027d made herself cry buckets. That had landed her a genuine silk nightie.\\n\\n Once they were married, she\u0027d have herself a whole drawerful if she wanted. And one of those American Express credit cards to buy them with.\\n\\n The moon was full enough, so she didn\u0027t bother with a flashlight. She didn\u0027t want to spoil the mood. She fluffed her long blond hair, then tugged her skinny tank top down until her ripe breasts all but spilled over the edge. Her hot-pink shorts cut into her crotch a bit, but she figured the effect was worth it.\\n\\n If she played her cards right, Tucker would have her out of them in no time. Just thinking of it made her damp. Nobody did it like Tucker. Why, sometimes when he was touching her, she forgot all about his money. She wanted him inside her tonight, not only for the thrill of doing it outside, but because the timing was just right. With luck her claim about being pregnant would be fact before morning.\\n\\n She moved through the thick leaves, the vines, through the heady smells of wet and honeysuckle and her own perfume. Moonlight spilled onto the ground in shifting patterns. Country born and country raised, she didn\u0027t shiver at the night sounds. The plop and peep of frogs, the rustle of marsh grasses, the high song of cicadas or rude hoot from owls.\\n\\n She caught the glint of yellow eyes that might have been a coon or a fox. But they vanished when she stepped closer. Some small victim squealed in the grass. Edda Lou paid no more attention to the sound of the creature\u0027s death than a New Yorker would have to the commonplace wail of a siren.\\n\\n This was the place of the night hunter-the owl and the fox. She was too pragmatic a woman to consider herself as prey.\\n\\n Her feet were silent on the soft ground and marshy grasses. Moonlight filtered over her, turning the skin she religiously pampered into something almost as elegant as marble. And because she was smiling, certain in her victory, there was a kind of hot beauty to her face.\\n\\n \"Tucker?\" She used the little-girl voice that was her way of wheedling. \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m late, honey.\"\\n\\n She stopped by the pond, and though her night vision was almost as sharp as a cat\u0027s, saw nothing but water and rock and thick vegetation. Her mouth thinned, erasing the beauty. She\u0027d purposely arrived late, wanting to keep him sweating for ten or fifteen minutes.\\n\\n In a huff, she sat on the log where Tucker had sat only hours before. But she didn\u0027t feel his presence. Only annoyance that she had come running when he\u0027d crooked his finger. And he hadn\u0027t even crooked it in person, but with a stingy little note.\\n\\n Meet me at McNair Pond at midnight. We\u0027ll fix everything. I only want to be alone with you for a little while.\\n\\n And wasn\u0027t that just like him? Edda Lou thought. Making her go all soft, saying how he wanted to be alone with her, then pissing her off because he was late.\\n\\n Five minutes, she decided. That was all he was getting. Then she was going to drive on up the road, right through those fancy gates and up to the big house. She\u0027d let Tucker Longstreet know that he couldn\u0027t play around with her affections.\\n\\n At the whisper of sound behind her, she turned her head, prepared to flutter her lashes. The blow to the base of her skull had her tumbling facedown in the earth.\\n\\n Her moan was muffled. Edda Lou heard it in her head, and her head felt as though it had been split in two by a dull rock. She tried to lift it. Oh, but it hurt, it hurt! When she started to bring her hands up to hold the ache, she found them stuck tight behind her.\\n\\n The first quiver of fear pierced through the pain. Opening her eyes wide, she tried to call out. But her mouth was gagged. She could taste the cloth and the cologne that scented it. Her eyes rolled wildly as she fought to work her hands free.\\n\\n She was naked, and her bare back and buttocks were scraping into bark as she wriggled against the tree. She\u0027d been tied hand and foot to a live oak, her feet expertly cinched so that her legs were spread in a vulnerable V. Visions of rape danced hideously through her mind.\\n\\n \"Edda Lou. Edda Lou.\" The voice was low and harsh, like the scrape of metal against rock. Edda Lou\u0027s terrified eyes wheeled in their sockets as she tried to find the source.\\n\\n All she saw was the water and the thick black of clustered leaves. She tried to scream and choked on the gag.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve had my eye on you. I wondered how soon we\u0027d get together like this. Romantic, isn\u0027t it, being naked in the moonlight? And we\u0027re all alone, you and me. All alone. Let\u0027s have sex.\"\\n\\n Paralyzed with terror, she watched the figure slip out of the shadows. Saw the moonlight glint on naked skin. Saw it flash for one hideous instant on the long-bladed knife.\\n\\n Now it was terror and revulsion she felt as she recognized what was coming toward her. Her stomach clenched and rolled, and she tasted sickness on her tongue. But the figure came closer, gilded by a fine sheen of sweat and smelling of madness. Her pleas and prayers were smothered by the gag. Thin streams of blood ran down her back and legs as she twisted desperately against the tree. The hands were on her, squeezing, stroking. And the mouth. Hot, frightened tears slid down her cheeks as the mouth closed hungrily over her defenseless breasts. Slick with sweat, the body rubbed against hers, doing things she didn\u0027t want to believe could be done to her. Her weeping was mindless now, her body shuddering at every touch of the wet mouth, the intruding fingers, the smooth flat of the buck knife. For she had remembered what had happened to Arnette and Francie, and knew they had felt this same numb terror, felt the same sick revulsion in the last moments of their lives.\\n\\n \"You want it. You want it.\" The breathless chant rolled over the dull buzzing in Edda\u0027s brain. \"Whore.\" The knife turned, slicing delicately, almost painlessly, down Edda Lou\u0027s arm. As the mouth closed greedily over the wound, Edda Lou slumped into a half faint.\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t.\" A hand slapped playfully across her face to revive her. \"No sleeping on the job for whores.\" There was a quick, almost giggly laugh. Blood smeared the smiling lips. Edda Lou\u0027s glazed eyes opened and fixed. \"Better, that\u0027s better. I want you to watch. Ready?\"\\n\\n \"Please, please, please,\" her mind screamed. \"Don\u0027t kill me. I won\u0027t tell, I won\u0027t tell, I won\u0027t tell.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" The voice was husky with arousal, and Edda Lou smelled her own fear, her own blood, when that face leaned close to hers, with madness shining out of eyes she\u0027d known very well. \"You\u0027re not worth fucking.\"\\n\\n One hand ripped aside the gag. Part of the pleasure, the need, was to hear that one high scream. It was cut off as the knife slashed Edda Lou\u0027s throat.\\n\\n Caroline sat straight up in bed, heart thudding like a Maytag with an unbalanced load. She was clutching both hands to it, nearly ripping her thin sleep shirt in reaction.\\n\\n A scream, she thought wildly while her ragged breathing echoed in the room. Who was screaming?\\n\\n She was nearly out of bed and fumbling for the light when she remembered where she was and sagged back against the pillows. Not Philadelphia. Not Baltimore, or New York or Paris. She was in rural Mississippi, sleeping in the bed her grandparents had slept in.\\n\\n Night sounds seemed to fill the room. Peepers, crickets, cicadas. And owls. She heard another scream, eerily like a woman\u0027s. Screech owls, they called them, she remembered now. Her grandmother had soothed her one night during that long-ago visit when the same rusty cry had awakened her.\\n\\n Just an old screech owl, pumpkin pie. Don\u0027t you worry now. You\u0027re safe as a bug in a rug.\\n\\n Closing her eyes, Caroline listened to the long whooo-whooo of another, better-mannered owl. Country sounds, she assured herself, and tried to ignore the creaking and settling of the old house. Soon they would seem as natural to her as the whoosh of traffic or the whine of distant sirens.\\n\\n It was just as her grandmother had told her. She was safe as a bug in a rug. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence/page-3.html","bookId":2411,"book":{"id":2411,"title":"Carnal Innocence","description":"Storyline: In the small town of Innocence, Mississippi, days are long, nights are fragrant, and secrets are hard to keep. But when a brutal killer starts claiming the lives of the town\u0027s most attractive women, lifelong neighbors are forced to wonder if the culprit is a stranger lurking in the bayou...or someone right next door. \\n World-famous concert violinist Caroline Waverly knows nothing of the murders when she arrives in Innocence. Burned out from a childhood lost to endless rehearsals and an all-too-public breakup with the conductor who was her lover, Caroline is looking for a little peace and some time to think. She hopes that a stay at her late grandmother\u0027s house the one with a covered porch just made for soft summer nights will provide the tranquillity she needs. But Innocence has something else to offer Caroline: a man named Tucker Longstreet. \\n Blessed with the Longstreet good looks, lazy charm, and family fortune, Tucker is a tall, cool drink of water and he knows it. He likes to keep his romances short and shallow. But one look at Caroline, and Tucker realizes that she is unlike any other woman he\u0027s met. Tightly coiled and coolly reserved, Caroline is determined to fight him off.

Because there\u0027s just one small problem with her new romance: Tucker is the leading suspect in the killings.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/carnal-innocence.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:48 AM"}}
