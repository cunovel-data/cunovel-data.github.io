{"id":75150,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"Don\u0027t you ever work?\" Caroline asked as she struggled to gather up the wiggling puppy, her purse, and some of her purchases.\n \"Only if they catch me.\" Tucker set the roses aside, then lazily unfolded himself. \"Whatcha got there, Caro?\"\n \"I call it a dog.\"\n He chuckled and wandered over to where she\u0027d managed to squeeze her car next to the boat-sized Oldsmobile. \"Cute little fella.\" He ruffled the pup\u0027s fur, then peeked in the back of the BMW. \"Need some help?\"\n She blew her hair out of her eyes. \"What do you think?\"\n \"I think you\u0027re glad to see me.\" He took advantage of her loaded arms and kissed her. \"And you wish you weren\u0027t. Go on and take a load off. I\u0027ll haul the rest of this out for you.\"\n She did, mainly to see if he could do anything with his hands other than raise a woman\u0027s blood pressure. After she\u0027d sat on the steps, Caroline worked on fastening the new collar around the squirming puppy\u0027s neck.\n \"Looks like you got all the essentials,\" Tucker commented. He pulled out a bag, tossed the sack of puppy food over his shoulder. There was a faint and interesting ripple of muscle, Caroline noticed. Then he gathered up the bright-flowered cushion. \"What\u0027s this?\"\n \"He\u0027s got to sleep on something.\"\n Your bed, Tucker figured with a grin. The pup didn\u0027t look backward. \"So...\" He dumped everything on the porch, then sat next to her. \"That one of the Fuller pups?\"\n \"Yes.\" The pup deserted her to sniff at Tucker\u0027s hand. Caroline could smell the roses and determined not to be charmed by them, not to ask about them, not even to look at them.\n \"Hey, boy.\" Tucker scratched the pup in a spot that had Useless grinning and slapping a hind foot rhythmically on the step. \"That\u0027s a good dog, yeah. That\u0027s a pretty good dog. So what\u0027s his name?\"\n \"Useless,\" Caroline muttered as the puppy-her puppy, she reminded herself-stretched himself adoringly over Tucker\u0027s lap. \"I\u0027ve already figured out he would be, as a guard dog.\"\n Tucker\u0027s brows drew together briefly. \"Guard dog, huh?\" He tickled the puppy into turning over. \"Hey, boy, let me see those teeth.\" Useless obligingly chewed on Tucker\u0027s knuckle. \"Well, they\u0027ll grow soon enough. Just like the rest of him. Couple of months he\u0027ll start to grow into his feet.\"\n \"In a couple of months I-I\u0027ll be in Europe,\" she finished. \"Actually, I may be leaving sooner than that. There\u0027s an engagement I might have to take-in September-that would require me to go to D.C. in August to prepare.\"\n \"Have to take?\"\n She hadn\u0027t meant to put it that way. \"There\u0027s an engagement,\" she said, dismissing the rest. \"But I imagine I\u0027ll be able to find a good home for the puppy before I leave.\"\n Tucker looked up at her, golden eyes calm and just a little hard. He had a way of looking now and again, she thought, that stripped away all the nonsense and carved down to truth. \"I expect you could take a dog along if you wanted to.\" His voice was quiet, hardly more than a ripple on the hot, still air. \"You\u0027re a pretty big deal in what you do, aren\u0027t you?\"\n She hated the fact that she had to look away, had to before he saw through to things she was still hiding from herself. \"Touring\u0027s complicated,\" she said, and left it at that.\n But he didn\u0027t.\n \"Do you like it?\"\n \"It\u0027s part of what I do.\" She started to make a grab for the puppy, when he scrambled off Tucker\u0027s lap to go exploring. \"He could wander off.\"\n \"He\u0027s just sniffing the place out. You didn\u0027t answer me, Caroline. Do you like it?\"\n \"It\u0027s not a matter of like or dislike. When you\u0027re performing, you travel.\" Airport to airport, she thought, city to city, hotel to hotel, rehearsal to rehearsal. She felt the tightening in her stomach, the little pull of a knot being tied. It warned her to ease off unless she wanted to extend an invitation to her old friend Mr. Ulcer.\n When a man was rarely tense himself, he recognized the symptoms. Casually, he put a hand to the back of her neck and rubbed. \"I never could understand why somebody\u0027d make a habit of doing something they didn\u0027t care for.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t say-\"\n \"Sure you did. You didn\u0027t say, Oh my gracious, Tuck, there\u0027s nothing like it. Flying off to London, scooting on to Paris, cruising over to Vienna or Venice. Now, I\u0027ve always wanted to see some of those places myself. But you don\u0027t sound like you\u0027ve piled up a load of fun by doing it.\"\n See? she thought. What did you really see between interviews, rehearsals, performances, and packing? \"There are people in this world who don\u0027t consider fun their life\u0027s ambition.\" She heard her own voice, recognized it as prim, and pouted in disgust.\n \"Now, that\u0027s a shame.\" He settled back to light a cigarette. \"See that pup there? He\u0027s sniffing \u0027round there, happy as a frog with a belly full of flies. He\u0027ll water your grass, chase his tail if it appeals to him, then settle down and take a nice nap. I always figured dogs had the best idea for getting through.\"\n Her lips twitched. \"Just let me know if you have an urge to water my grass.\"\n But Tucker didn\u0027t smile back. He studied the glowing tip of his cigarette a moment, then shot her that calm, scapel-honed look. \"I asked Doc Shays about those pills you gave me. The Percodan? He said they were potent. It caused me to wonder why you\u0027d need them.\"\n She toughened up. The way she drew in reminded him of a porcupine curling up and showing spines to anything curious enough to take a poke. \"That\u0027s none of your business.\"\n He put a hand on her cheek. \"Caroline, I care about you.\"\n She was very aware-they both were-that he\u0027d said that before, to dozens of women. And they were both aware, uncomfortably, that this time it was different.\n \"I get headaches,\" she said, hating the fact that her voice was waspish and defensive.\n \"Regular?\"\n \"What is this? A test? A lot of people get headaches, especially if they do more than sit in a porch rocker all day.\"\n \"I prefer a good rope hammock myself,\" he said equably. \"But we were talking about you.\"\n Her eyes went flat and cold. \"Back off, Tucker.\"\n Normally he would have. He wasn\u0027t one to poke and prod where his hand could get snapped off. \"It doesn\u0027t sit well with me, thinking about you hurting.\"\n \"I\u0027m not hurting.\" But a headache was coming on as relentlessly as a highballing freight train.\n \"Or worrying.\"\n \"Worrying.\" She repeated the word twice, then dropped her head in her lap and laughed. There was a tint of hysteria in the sound that had the puppy bellying over to whine at her feet. \"Oh, what\u0027s to worry about? Just because some maniac\u0027s out carving up women and leaving them floating in my pond. Why should I worry that Austin Hatinger\u0027s on the loose again, and may decide to come back and blow out my windows? I certainly shouldn\u0027t lose any sleep over the fact that he\u0027s sure to try to put a few holes in you.\"\n \"I\u0027m not looking for more holes than I\u0027ve already got.\" He ran a soothing hand up and down her spine. \"We Longstreets have a knack for coming out on top.\"\n \"Oh, I can see that. With your eye blackened and your head bashed in.\"\n Tucker frowned a little. He\u0027d been thinking his eye was looking a lot better. \"By next week the bruises\u0027ll go and Austin\u0027s likely to be back in jail. Longstreet luck works that way, darlin\u0027. Take Cousin Jeremiah.\"\n Caroline groaned, but he ignored her.\n \"Now, he was a good friend of Davy Crockett\u0027s. A Kentucky boy, you know?\" His voice settled naturally into a story-telling mode. \"They\u0027d fought together during the War for Independence. \u0027Course, Jeremiah\u0027d been no more\u0027n a boy then, but he sure did like to fight. After the war he knocked around here and there, not quite sure what the hell to do with himself. Never settled down. It was like he couldn\u0027t find himself a purpose. Anyhow, he heard about this ruckus going on in Texas, and figured he\u0027d mosey on over and see his old friend Davy. Maybe shoot a few Mexicans. He was still this side of Louisiana when his horse stepped down in a rabbit hole. Tossed Jeremiah off. Horse broke a leg, so did Jeremiah. Had to shoot the horse, which pained Jeremiah some, as they\u0027d been together the best part of eight years.\n \"Now, it so happened this farmer came along, hauled Jeremiah back to his place in his wagon. The farmer had a daughter, as any decent farmer should, and between them they set the leg-it was a bad break and nearly did Jeremiah in, but after a couple a weeks he was able to hobble around on a crutch.\"\n \"And he fell in love with the farmer\u0027s daughter, had a handsome brood of children who got rich planting cotton or whatever they plant in Louisiana.\"\n \"That\u0027s true enough, but not my point exactly. The point is Jeremiah lost his horse and walked with a limp the rest of his days. But he never did get out there to join Davy in Texas. At the Alamo.\"\n She\u0027d turned her head to rest her cheek on her knees so that she could watch him as he finished the story which was probably a lie. The odd thing was her headache had receded along with those warning jags in her stomach.\n \"So the point is,\" she said, \"a Longstreet\u0027s lucky enough to break a leg to avoid something more fatal.\"\n \"There you go. Now, honey, why don\u0027t you gather up your dog and whatever you think you need and come on down and stay at Sweetwater for a while?\" The instant wariness in her eyes made him smile. \"We\u0027ve got a dozen bedrooms or more, so you don\u0027t have to stay in mine.\" He flicked a finger down her nose. \"Unless you\u0027re ready to admit you\u0027re going to end up there sooner or later anyway.\"\n \"I thank you for the graciousness of your offer, but I\u0027ll have to decline.\"\n The faintest shadow of impatience flickered in his eyes. \"Caroline, you\u0027ve got plenty of chaperones and a good solid lock on every bedroom door if you\u0027re thinking I\u0027ll try to sneak under your sheets.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure you would,\" she said, but with a laugh. \"And don\u0027t flatter yourself by thinking I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t handle you. I have to stay here.\"\n \"I\u0027m not proposing you move in permanently.\" But it surprised him that the idea didn\u0027t give him the shivers. \"Just for a visit, till Austin\u0027s where he belongs.\"\n \"I have to stay here,\" she said again. \"Tucker, up until the last couple months I\u0027ve never taken a stand on anything. My whole life I\u0027ve done what I was told, gone where I was pointed, and acted as I was expected to act.\"\n \"Tell me.\"\n \"No, not now.\" She let out a long sigh. \"Maybe some other time. But this is my home, my place, and I\u0027m sticking. My grandmother lived here her entire adult life. My mother was born here, though she\u0027d prefer you didn\u0027t mention it. I\u0027d like to think there was enough McNair in me to last one summer.\" She shook off the mood and smiled. \"Are you going to give me those flowers or let them wilt on the step?\"\n He considered several valid arguments, then let it go. When people weren\u0027t allowed to go their own way, they were more likely to break than bend. \"These?\" All innocence, he held up the roses. The little plastic nipple of water each stem was tucked in kept them fresh. \"Did you want them?\"\n She shrugged. \"I wouldn\u0027t want them to go to waste.\"\n \"Me neither, since I had to drive all the way over to Rosedale to get them-and that wine there. Had to borrow Delia\u0027s car to do it,\" he added, taking an indulgent sniff of the blooms. \"And with Delia, nothing comes free. You should\u0027ve seen the list of chores she gave me. Dry cleaning and marketing, and since she\u0027d gotten herself a flyer about a dollar sale at Woolworth\u0027s, I had to fetch all that stuff, too. I drew the line at picking out a negligee for her sister Sarah\u0027s girl, who\u0027s engaged to be married and having a wedding shower next week. A man\u0027s got to have his standards, and I don\u0027t buy fancy underwear for women unless I\u0027m intimately acquainted with them.\"\n \"You\u0027re a man of substance, Tucker.\"\n \"It\u0027s a matter of principle.\" He laid the roses over her lap, where the slender cupped blossoms glowed like little points of sunlight. \"I thought yellow ones suited you best.\"\n \"They\u0027re beautiful.\" She inhaled the perfume, sweet and strong. \"I suppose I\u0027ll have to thank you for them, and for all the trouble you went through to get them for me.\"\n \"You could kiss me instead. I\u0027d rather you did.\" He smiled when her brow creased, then tipped up his chin with a fingertip. \"Don\u0027t think about it, Caroline, just do it. It\u0027s better than any pill for curing headaches.\"\n So with the roses glowing between them, she leaned over and touched her lips to his. The taste was as sweet and as strong as the fragrance that floated over to her. And, she discovered, as comforting. A little dreamy-eyed, she started to draw back, but he cupped a hand around the back of her neck.\n \"You Yankees,\" he murmured. \"Always in a hurry.\" He nudged her mouth back to his.\n He was savoring. She understood that even as her mind began to mist over with emotion. She was aware of how slow, how deep a kiss could be if you just let yourself fall into it. With a little sigh she did just that.\n Even when she felt his fingers tense on her skin, she didn\u0027t worry. Under the palm she\u0027d pressed to his chest, his heart was beating fast and hard. But the rhythm brought her pleasure rather than taut nerves.\n And all the while his lips cruised over hers so that the kiss was like slipping into a cool blue lake dappled with sunlight.\n It was he who drew back now. He hadn\u0027t touched her, but for those fingers that had grown strong at the back of her neck, he hadn\u0027t touched her. Hadn\u0027t dared. For he knew once he did, he wouldn\u0027t be able to stop.\n Something here wasn\u0027t playing the tune he was used to. Difficult though it was to stop, Tucker knew he\u0027d better think this through.\n \"I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027re going to ask me in.\"\n \"No,\" she said, and let out a long breath. \"Not yet.\"\n \"I\u0027d better be getting back, then.\" After a quick internal tug-of-war between stay and go, he rose. \"I promised Cousin Lulu a game of Parcheesi. She cheats.\" He grinned. \"But so do I, and I\u0027m quicker.\"\n \"Thanks for the flowers. And the wine.\"\n Tucker stepped over the pup, who was snoring at the base of the stairs. Since there was only three inches between Delia\u0027s Olds and the BMW, he had to get in through the passenger side and slide over. After he\u0027d started the engine, he rolled down the window.\n \"You keep that wine chilled, sugar. I\u0027ll be back.\"\n As Caroline watched him shoot backward down her lane, she wondered why that brief, cocky statement had sounded so much like a threat.\n Josie and Crystal sat in their favorite booth in the Chat \u0027N Chew. Their excuse was dinner, but since both of them were on a perpetual diet, the reason was gossip.\n Josie poked at her chicken salad with little interest. What she wanted was a thick steak and a side of nice greasy fries. But she worried about her body. She was past thirty now, and watched vigilantly for any sags or droops or paunches.\n Her mama had kept a trim, willowy figure up to the day she\u0027d dropped dead in her roses. Josie intended to do no less.\n Since the day she\u0027d realized her mama was different from her daddy, Josie had been in a subtle and constant competition. It had made her feel guilty from time to time, but she hadn\u0027t been able to resist the need to be as pretty as her mother. Then prettier. To be as desirable to men. Then more desirable.\n She\u0027d never been able to get a handle on her mother\u0027s quiet dignity, had failed miserably in trying to emulate it in her first marriage, so she had chosen to copy her father\u0027s bold and bawdy talk instead. She felt it suited her-the stunning femme-fatale looks and the earthy personality. As a child she\u0027d fit the pieces of herself together. Now the puzzle of Josie Longstreet was linked tight.\n While Josie toyed with her chicken salad, Crystal made short work of her tuna-stuffed tomato. Crystal was chattering the whole time she forked the tuna into her mouth. As she had all of her life, Josie turned the sound on and off.\n She was fond of Crystal, had been since they\u0027d made the solemn decision to be best friends back in first grade, when they\u0027d been two privileged little girls with no idea how radically their lives would diverge. Josie going one way-debutante balls and that first, proper marriage. Crystal going another, after her lawyer father ran off to parts unknown with his secretary. Her path had been the work force and a bad marriage that had ended in divorce after a second miscarriage.\n But they had remained friends. Whenever Josie swept back into Innocence, she always spent time with Crystal. Josie was sentimental enough to want a childhood friend in her adult life. And she liked the way they complemented each other. Crystal was tiny and nicely rounded while Josie herself was tall and slim. Crystal had white skin dashed with a sprinkle of freckles. She\u0027d spent a fortune on every freckle remover on the market until she\u0027d finally accepted them as a personality trait. She\u0027d learned to care for her skin in Madame Alexandra\u0027s Beauty School in Lamont, where she\u0027d graduated third in her class and had the certificate to prove it.\n As a result, she had the blooming complexion of a milkmaid, which was the perfect foil for Josie\u0027s dusky Gypsy looks. Her hair, which she changed every few months as a kind of walking advertisement for her skills, was currently Clairol\u0027s Sparkling Sherry, which she wore in a viciously lacquered modified beehive. Crystal insisted they were coming back.\n \"And then, when Bea was doing Nancy Koons\u0027s nails, that Justine started going on about how Will told her the FBI figured out it was a black that killed Edda Lou and the others. How they knew it \u0027cause of the way they were killed, and how they\u0027d found this pubic hair and all.\" Crystal dug into her tomato, daintily tipping the tuna onto her fork with her pinky. \"Now, I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s the way it was or not, but I don\u0027t think it was right for her to be going on like that with Bea-who\u0027s black as the ace of spades-sitting there filing nails. I was real embarrassed, Josie, but Bea, she just asks Nancy if she wants ridge filler, and keeps on filing.\"\n Josie sucked on her straw. \"Justine\u0027s so besotted with Will, if he told her a frog shits gold nuggets, she\u0027d be panning for them in Little Hope Creek.\"\n \"That\u0027s no excuse,\" Crystal said righteously. \"I mean, we all know it probably was a colored, but you won\u0027t find me talking about it in front of Bea. Why, Bea\u0027s my best operator. So I gave Justine\u0027s hair a jerk and when she squealed, I said, just as nice as you please: \u0027Oh, honey, did that hurt? I\u0027m awful sorry. All that talk about murder and all just makes me so nervous. Good thing I didn\u0027t clip your earlobe while I was trimming. A clipped ear bleeds worse\u0027n a stuck pig.\u0027 \" Crystal smiled. \"That shut her right up.\"\n \"Maybe I\u0027ll talk Will into driving me home tonight.\" Josie tossed back her mane of hair. \"That\u0027ll give Justine something to squeal about.\"\n Crystal gave one of her quick, birdlike laughs. \"Oh, Josie. You\u0027re such a one.\" Her eyes shifted as the diner\u0027s door swung open. Poking out her lip, she leaned closer to Josie. \"There\u0027s that Darleen Talbot coming in with her baby.\" She sniffed and sucked her Coke dry. \"There\u0027s trash and there\u0027s trash, I say.\"\n Josie\u0027s gaze flicked up as Darleen walked by to settle herself in a booth. \"Billy T. Bonny, huh?\"\n \"Speaking of trash.\" And Crystal dearly loved to. \"Just like I told you, I saw him saunter right on in Darleen\u0027s kitchen door not ten minutes after Junior went out the front. And all she was wearing was a little pink baby-doll nightgown when she let him in. I saw them clear through Susie Truesdale\u0027s kitchen window. There I was, rinsing Susie\u0027s hair in the sink. Now, that Susie, she keeps a spotless kitchen, let me tell you, even with all those kids. If her youngest hadn\u0027t had a sick stomach, she\u0027d have come on in the shop for her usual wash and style, and I wouldn\u0027t have seen a thing.\"\n \"What did Susie say?\"\n \"Well, her head was in the sink, but when I was blowing her dry, I mentioned it, real casual like. And I could see by the way she looked that she knew. But she just said she never paid any mind to what went on next door.\"\n \"So Darleen\u0027s cheating on Junior with Billy T.\" Josie\u0027s lips curved around her straw. Her eyes took on that deep, faraway glow that warned Crystal something was up.\n \"You\u0027re thinking, Josie.\"\n \"I was doing just that, Crystal. I was thinking that Junior\u0027s got a sweet face even if he is a little bit dim. And I\u0027m real fond of him.\"\n \"Shoot.\" Crystal poked at the remains of her tomato. \"Far as I know, he\u0027s about the only man in town between twenty and fifty you\u0027ve never looked twice at.\"\n \"I can be fond of a man without wanting to do it with him.\" Josie examined her straw. There was a smear of red on the tip. \"Seems to me somebody ought to give him a little hint about what\u0027s happening in his own house when he\u0027s not around to see it.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, Josie.\"\n \"I know, and that\u0027s enough.\" She dug in her bag for a pad and pen. \"Let\u0027s see now. I\u0027ll just write him a little note, and you can get it to him.\"\n \"Me?\" Crystal squeaked, then looked guiltily around. \"How come I have to do it?\"\n \"Because everybody knows you stop at the station on your way home to buy yourself a Milky Way bar.\"\n \"Well, sure, but-\"\n \"So when you go in,\" Josie continued, busily writing, \"all you have to do is distract Junior while he\u0027s got the cash register open. Then you drop this on in and scoot out. Easy as pie.\"\n \"You know I always get a rash under my arms when I get nervous.\" Crystal thought she could already feel her skin prickling.\n \"Two seconds, and you\u0027re all done.\" When she saw Crystal wavering, Josie brought out the big guns. \"I told you, didn\u0027t I, how Darleen was saying that color you used on her hair turned brassy and she was going to save her money by doing it herself with Miss Clairol? She said right out that it was a crime for you to charge seventeen fifty for a color job when all anyone had to do was pick up a box for five dollars and do it themselves.\"\n \"That little bitch has no right talking that way to my customers.\" Crystal was fired up now. \"Why, she\u0027s got hair like a Brillo pad, and if I\u0027ve told her once, I\u0027ve told her a thousand times, she\u0027s got to have a professional tend to it or else it\u0027ll start falling right out of her head.\" She sniffed. \"Hope it does.\"\n Josie smiled and waved the note in front of Crystal\u0027s nose. Glaring, Crystal snatched it.\n \"Just look at her,\" Crystal continued. \"Sitting there putting on lipstick while that baby smears ice cream all over itself.\"\n Casually, Josie turned her head. She started to remark that Darleen would look better herself, smeared with a little cherry vanilla. The glint of the gold case on the tube of lipstick stopped her.\n \"Now, isn\u0027t that funny,\" she murmured.\n \"What?\"\n \"Nothing. I\u0027ll be right back, Crystal.\" Josie rose, and trailing a finger over the back of the booths, strolled up to Darleen. \"Hey, Darleen. This baby of yours sure is getting big.\"\n \"He\u0027s eight months now.\" Surprised and flattered that Josie had come over, Darleen set the lipstick aside to wipe ineffectually at Scooter\u0027s face with a paper napkin. Infuriated by the interruption, he howled. Josie eyed the lipstick case while Darleen and the baby fussed at each other.\n It wasn\u0027t a mistake, she thought. No indeedy. She\u0027d bought that lipstick in Jackson, at the Elizabeth Arden counter. That gold case had caught her eye, and that particular shade of red.\n Hers was missing, too. And had been since... since the night she\u0027d gotten plowed-in more ways than one-in the embalming room of Palmer\u0027s with Teddy Rubenstein. She\u0027d come home, Josie remembered, and had dropped her purse getting out of the car. Everything had spilled out.\n And the next day Tucker had wrecked his car because somebody\u0027d poked holes in some lines.\n \"That\u0027s a pretty lipstick you\u0027ve got there, Darleen. Looks good on you.\"\n Josie\u0027s eyes had taken on a hard, hunting edge, but Darleen heard only the compliment. \"Red lipstick\u0027s sexy, I think. A man likes to see a woman\u0027s lips coming.\"\n \"I like red myself, and I never saw that shade before. Where\u0027d you get it?\"\n \"Oh.\" Darleen flushed a little, but was flattered enough to pick up the case and turn it around in the light. \"It was a present.\"\n Josie\u0027s grin was fiercely jovial. \"My, I do love presents. Don\u0027t you?\"\n She turned without waiting for an answer and strode out past a baffled Crystal.\n Fifteen minutes later Tucker, who was resting after three hard-fought games of Parcheesi, had his peace disturbed when Josie shook him awake and poured out her story.\n Blinking against the last slants of sunlight, he tried to get his mushy brain around it.\n \"Just slow down, Jose, for chrissake. I\u0027m not even awake yet.\"\n \"Then wake up, goddammit.\" She gave him a shove that nearly tilted him out of the hammock. \"I\u0027m telling you Billy T. Bonny\u0027s the one who messed with your car, and I want to know what you\u0027re going to do about it.\"\n \"You\u0027re telling me he used lipstick to poke holes in my hydraulic and brake lines?\"\n \"No, you peabrain.\" She took a breath and went through the whole business again.\n \"Honey, just because Darleen had the same color lipstick as you-\"\n \"Tucker.\" Patience wasn\u0027t one of Josie\u0027s virtues, and she punched him, hard. \"A woman knows her own lipstick when she sees it.\"\n He rubbed his arm, willing to concede the point. \"You could\u0027ve dropped it anyplace.\"\n \"I did not drop it anyplace, I dropped it right over there in the drive. I used it the night I went out with Teddy, and I didn\u0027t have it the next morning. Or my mother-of-pearl fold-up mirror either.\" Fury flared in her eyes. \"The bitch\u0027s probably got that, too.\"\n With a sigh, Tucker rose. It wasn\u0027t likely he\u0027d be able to get in another nap. He wasn\u0027t mad yet, only because it all seemed a little farfetched.\n \"Where are you going?\"\n \"I\u0027ll go pass this along to Burke.\"\n Josie slapped her hands on her hips. \"Daddy\u0027d have gone and stuck a rifle barrel up Billy T.\u0027s ass.\"\n Tucker turned, and though his face remained calm, his eyes weren\u0027t. \"I\u0027m not Daddy, Josie.\"\n She was sorry immediately and rushed over to throw her arms around him. \"Honey, that was awful of me. I didn\u0027t mean it, either.

I\u0027m going to take your car.\"\n \"Okay.

But when a brutal killer starts claiming the lives of the town\u0027s most attractive women, lifelong neighbors are forced to wonder if the culprit is a stranger lurking in the bayou...or someone right next door. \n World-famous concert violinist Caroline Waverly knows nothing of the murders when she arrives in Innocence. Burned out from a childhood lost to endless rehearsals and an all-too-public breakup with the conductor who was her lover, Caroline is looking for a little peace and some time to think. She hopes that a stay at her late grandmother\u0027s house the one with a covered porch just made for soft summer nights will provide the tranquillity she needs. But Innocence has something else to offer Caroline: a man named Tucker Longstreet. \n Blessed with the Longstreet good looks, lazy charm, and family fortune, Tucker is a tall, cool drink of water and he knows it. He likes to keep his romances short and shallow. But one look at Caroline, and Tucker realizes that she is unlike any other woman he\u0027s met. Tightly coiled and coolly reserved, Caroline is determined to fight him off. She might be able to do a better job if she hadn\u0027t felt an unexpected thrill at his ardent advances...and if she hadn\u0027t been so scared after finding a third murder victim in the murky waters behind her home. \n For Caroline Waverly,a beautiful summer interlude could turn into much more or could stir a killer\u0027s crazed dreams. Because there\u0027s just one small problem with her new romance: Tucker is the leading suspect in the killings.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/carnal-innocence.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:48 AM"}}
