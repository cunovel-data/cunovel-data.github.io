What\u0027s the matter with this place? I\u0027m sitting on something wet. It\u0027s getting wetter every minute.\" He struggled to his feet.\n \"Let\u0027s get out,\" said Edmund, \"they\u0027ve gone.\"\n \"O-o-oh!\" said Susan suddenly, and everyone asked her what was the matter.\n \"I\u0027m sitting against a tree,\" said Susan, \"and look! It\u0027s getting light - over there.\"\n \"By Jove, you\u0027re right,\" said Peter, \"and look there - and there. It\u0027s trees all round. And this wet stuff is snow. Why, I do believe we\u0027ve got into Lucy\u0027s wood after all.\"\n And now there was no mistaking it and all four children stood blinking in the daylight of a winter day. Behind them were coats hanging on pegs, in front of them were snow-covered trees.\n Peter turned at once to Lucy.\n \"I apologize for not believing you,\" he said, \"I\u0027m sorry. Will you shake hands?\"\n \"Of course,\" said Lucy, and did.\n \"And now,\" said Susan, \"what do we do next?\"\n \"Do?\" said Peter, \"why, go and explore the wood, of course.\"\n \"Ugh!\" said Susan, stamping her feet, \"it\u0027s pretty cold. What about putting on some of these coats?\"\n \"They\u0027re not ours,\" said Peter doubtfully.\n \"I am sure nobody would mind,\" said Susan; \"it isn\u0027t as if we wanted to take them out of the house; we shan\u0027t take them even out of the wardrobe.\"\n \"I never thought of that, Su,\" said Peter. \"Of course, now you put it that way, I see. No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it. And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe.\"\n They immediately carried out Susan\u0027s very sensible plan. The coats were rather too big for them so that they came down to their heels and looked more like royal robes than coats when they had put them on. But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new get-up and more suitable to the landscape.\n \"We can pretend we are Arctic explorers,\" said Lucy.\n \"This is going to be exciting enough without pretending,\" said Peter, as he began leading the way forward into the forest. There were heavy darkish clouds overhead and it looked as if there might be more snow before night.\n \"I say,\" began Edmund presently, \"oughtn\u0027t we to be bearing a bit more to the left, that is, if we are aiming for the lamp-post?\" He had forgotten for the moment that he must pretend never to have been in the wood before. The moment the words were out of his mouth he realized that he had given himself away. Everyone stopped; everyone stared at him. Peter whistled.\n \"So you really were here,\" he said, \"that time Lu said she\u0027d met you in here - and you made out she was telling lies.\"\n There was a dead silence. \"Well, of all the poisonous little beasts - \" said Peter, and shrugged his shoulders and said no more. There seemed, indeed, no more to say, and presently the four resumed their journey; but Edmund was saying to himself, \"I\u0027ll pay you all out for this, you pack of stuck-up, selfsatisfied prigs.\"\n \"Where are we going anyway?\" said Susan, chiefly for the sake of changing the subject.\n \"I think Lu ought to be the leader,\" said Peter; \"goodness knows she deserves it. Where will you take us, Lu?\"\n \"What about going to see Mr Tumnus?\" said Lucy. \"He\u0027s the nice Faun I told you about.\"\n Everyone agreed to this and off they went walking briskly and stamping their feet. Lucy proved a good leader. At first she wondered whether she would be able to find the way, but she recognized an oddlooking tree on one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr Tumnus\u0027s cave. But there a terrible surprise awaited them.\n The door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits. Inside, the cave was dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several days. Snow had drifted in from the doorway and was heaped on the floor, mixed with something black, which turned out to be the charred sticks and ashes from the fire. Someone had apparently flung it about the room and then stamped it out. The crockery lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun\u0027s father had been slashed into shreds with a knife.\n \"This is a pretty good wash-out,\" said Edmund; \"not much good coming here.\"\n \"What is this?\" said Peter, stooping down. He had just noticed a piece of paper which had been nailed through the carpet to the floor.\n \"Is there anything written on it?\" asked Susan.\n \"Yes, I think there is,\" answered Peter, \"but I can\u0027t read it in this light. Let\u0027s get out into the open air.\"\n They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter as he read out the following words:\n The former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, etc., also of comforting her said Majesty\u0027s enemies, harbouring spies and fraternizing with Humans.\n signed MAUGRIM, Captain of the Secret Police, LONG LIVE THE QUEEN\n The children stared at each other.\n \"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027m going to like this place after all,\" said Susan.\n \"Who is this Queen, Lu?\" said Peter. \"Do you know anything about her?\"\n \"She isn\u0027t a real queen at all,\" answered Lucy; \"she\u0027s a horrible witch, the White Witch. Everyone all the wood people - hate her. She has made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and never Christmas.\"\n \"I - I wonder if there\u0027s any point in going on,\" said Susan. \"I mean, it doesn\u0027t seem particularly safe here and it looks as if it won\u0027t be much fun either. And it\u0027s getting colder every minute, and we\u0027ve brought nothing to eat. What about just going home?\"\n \"Oh, but we can\u0027t, we can\u0027t,\" said Lucy suddenly; \"don\u0027t you see? We can\u0027t just go home, not after this. It is all on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble. He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back. That\u0027s what it means by comforting the Queen\u0027s enemies and fraternizing with Humans. We simply must try to rescue him.\"\n \"A lot we could do! said Edmund, \"when we haven\u0027t even got anything to eat!\"\n \"Shut up - you!\" said Peter, who was still very angry with Edmund. \"What do you think, Susan?\"\n \"I\u0027ve a horrid feeling that Lu is right,\" said Susan. \"I don\u0027t want to go a step further and I wish we\u0027d never come. But I think we must try to do something for Mr Whatever-his-name is - I mean the Faun.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I feel too,\" said Peter. \"I\u0027m worried about having no food with us. I\u0027d vote for going back and getting something from the larder, only there doesn\u0027t seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when once you\u0027ve got out of it. I think we\u0027ll have to go on.\"\n \"So do I,\" said both the girls.\n \"If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned!\" said Peter.\n They were all still wondering what to do next, when Lucy said, \"Look! There\u0027s a robin, with such a red breast. It\u0027s the first bird I\u0027ve seen here. I say! - I wonder can birds talk in Narnia? It almost looks as if it wanted to say something to us.\" Then she turned to the Robin and said, \"Please, can you tell us where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to?\" As she said this she took a step towards the bird. It at once flew away but only as far as to the next tree. There it perched and looked at them very hard as if it understood all they had been saying. Almost without noticing that they had done so, the four children went a step or two nearer to it. At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once more looked at them very hard. (You couldn\u0027t have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter eye.)\n \"Do you know,\" said Lucy, \"I really believe he means us to follow him.\"\n \"I\u0027ve an idea he does,\" said Susan. \"What do you think, Peter?\"\n \"Well, we might as well try it,\" answered Peter.\n The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly. It kept going from tree to tree, always a few yards ahead of them, but always so near that they could easily follow it. In this way it led them on, slightly downhill. Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch. Presently the clouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew dazzlingly bright. They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour, with the two girls in front, when Edmund said to Peter, \"if you\u0027re not still too high and mighty to talk to me, I\u0027ve something to say which you\u0027d better listen to.\"\n \"What is it?\" asked Peter.\n \"Hush! Not so loud,\" said Edmund; \"there\u0027s no good frightening the girls. But have you realized what we\u0027re doing?\"\n \"What?\" said Peter, lowering his voice to a whisper.\n \"We\u0027re following a guide we know nothing about. How do we know which side that bird is on? Why shouldn\u0027t it be leading us into a trap?\"\n \"That\u0027s a nasty idea. Still - a robin, you know. They\u0027re good birds in all the stories I\u0027ve ever read. I\u0027m sure a robin wouldn\u0027t be on the wrong side.\"\n \"It if comes to that, which is the right side? How do we know that the Fauns are in the right and the Queen (yes, I know we\u0027ve been told she\u0027s a witch) is in the wrong? We don\u0027t really know anything about either.\"\n \"The Faun saved Lucy.\"\n \"He said he did. But how do we know? And there\u0027s another thing too. Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here?\"\n \"Great Scott!\" said Peter, \"I hadn\u0027t thought of that.\"\n \"And no chance of dinner either,\" said Edmund. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-the-chronicles-of-narnia-1/page-6.html","bookId":2702,"book":{"id":2702,"title":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (The Chronicles of Narnia #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (The Chronicles of Narnia (Publication Order) #1) \n When Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy took their first steps into the world behind the magic wardrobe, little do they realise what adventures are about to unfold.
