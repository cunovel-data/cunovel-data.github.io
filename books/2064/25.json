{"id":110843,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"I DIDN\u0027T WANT TO SEE anyone after that. I trekked back to my room as quickly as I could, hardly noticing the obstacles and people in my path. Over and over, Dimitri\u0027s words played in my head: Love fades. Mine has. Somehow, that was the worst thing he could have said. Don\u0027t get me wrong: The rest wasn\u0027t easy either. Having him tell me he was going to avoid me and ignore our past relationship made me feel awful too. Yet, within that, no matter how much it hurt, was the tiny hope that there was still some spark of love between us. That he still loved me.\\n\\n But... love fades.\\n\\n That was something else altogether. It meant that what we had would die, going pale until it crumbled and drifted away like dried up leaves in the wind. The thought of it caused a pain in my chest and stomach, and I curled up on my bed, wrapping my arms around myself as though that might lessen the hurt. I couldn\u0027t accept what he had said. I couldn\u0027t accept that somehow, after his ordeal, his love for me had gone away.\\n\\n I wanted to stay in my room for the rest of the day, curled up in the darkness of my covers. I forgot about Sydney\u0027s conversation and my earlier concerns about Lissa\u0027s dad. I even let go of Lissa herself. She had a few errands today, but every so often, a message would flit to me through the bond: Come join me?\\n\\n When I didn\u0027t contact her, she began to grow worried. I was suddenly afraid that she--or someone else--might come seeking me in my room. So I decided to leave. I had no real destination; I just had to keep moving. I walked around the Court, scouting places I\u0027d never seen before. It was filled with more statues and fountains than I\u0027d realized. Their beauty was lost on me, though, and when I returned to my room hours later, I was exhausted from all the walking. Oh well. At least I\u0027d dodged having to talk to anyone.\\n\\n Or had I? It was late, past my usual bedtime, when a knock came at my door. I was hesitant to answer. Who would be coming by so late? Did I want the distraction or did I want to keep my solitude? I had no idea who it could be, save that it wasn\u0027t Lissa. God. For all I knew, it was Hans, demanding to know why I hadn\u0027t been showing up for my work detail. After much thinking (and more persistent knocking), I decided to open it.\\n\\n It was Adrian.\\n\\n \"Little dhampir,\" he said with a small, weary smile. \"You look like you\u0027ve seen a ghost.\"\\n\\n Not a ghost, exactly. Believe me, I knew ghosts when I saw them. \"I just... I just didn\u0027t really expect to see you after this morning....\"\\n\\n He entered and sat down on my bed, and I was glad to see he\u0027d cleaned up since our earlier talk. He wore fresh clothes, and his hair was back to its normal perfection. I still caught the lingering scent of cloves, but after what I\u0027d put him through, he was entitled to his vices.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, I didn\u0027t expect to come by either,\" he admitted. \"But you... well... you got me thinking about something.\"\\n\\n I sat down beside him, keeping a healthy distance. \"Us?\"\\n\\n \"No. Lissa.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" I\u0027d accused Dimitri of being egotistic, but here I was, naturally assuming love for me was all that could have driven Adrian over.\\n\\n His green eyes turned speculative. \"I kept thinking about what you\u0027d said, about her dad. And you were right--right about the gambling thing. He\u0027d have the money to pay off any debt. He wouldn\u0027t have had to keep it a secret. So I went and asked my mom.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" I exclaimed. \"No one\u0027s supposed to know that--\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah, I figured your information had been top secret. Don\u0027t worry. I told her that when we were in Vegas, we heard some people talking about it--about Lissa\u0027s dad making secret deposits.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027d she say?\"\\n\\n \"The same thing I did. Well, actually, she snapped at me first. She said Eric Dragomir was a good man and that I shouldn\u0027t spread rumors about the dead. She suggested that maybe he had a gambling problem, but if so, people shouldn\u0027t focus on that, when he did so many great things. After the Death Watch, I think she\u0027s afraid of me causing more public scenes.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s right. About Eric,\" I said. Maybe someone had stolen those records as some part of a slander campaign. Admittedly, spreading rumors about the dead was pointless, but maybe someone wanted to blacken the Dragomir reputation and get rid of any chance of the voting law being changed for Lissa? I was about to say as much to Adrian when he interrupted with something even more shocking.\\n\\n \"And then my dad overheard us, and he was like, \u0027He was probably funding some mistress. You\u0027re right--he was a nice guy. But he liked to flirt. And he liked the ladies.\u0027\" Adrian rolled his eyes. \"That\u0027s a direct quote: \u0027He liked the ladies.\u0027 My dad is such an ass. He sounds twice his age.\"\\n\\n I gripped Adrian\u0027s arm without realizing it. \"What did he say after that?\"\\n\\n Adrian shrugged but left my hand where it was. \"Nothing. My mom got mad and said the same thing to him that she said to me, that it was cruel to spread stories no one could prove.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think it\u0027s true? Do you think Lissa\u0027s dad had a mistress? Was that what he was paying out for?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know, little dhampir. Honestly? My dad\u0027s the type who would jump on any rumor he could. Or make one up. I mean, we know Lissa\u0027s dad liked to party. It\u0027s easy to jump to conclusions from there. Probably he had some dirty secret. Hell, we all do. Maybe whoever stole those files just wanted to exploit that.\"\\n\\n I told him my theory about it being used against Lissa. \"Or,\" I said, reconsidering, \"maybe someone who supports her took it. So that it wouldn\u0027t get out.\"\\n\\n Adrian nodded. \"Either way, I don\u0027t think Lissa\u0027s in mortal danger.\"\\n\\n He started to rise, and I pulled him back. \"Adrian, wait... I...\" I swallowed. \"I wanted to apologize. The way I\u0027ve been treating you, what I\u0027ve been doing... it wasn\u0027t fair to you. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n He looked away from me, eyes focused on the ground. \"You can\u0027t help the way you feel.\"\\n\\n \"The thing is... I don\u0027t know how I feel. And that sounds stupid, but it\u0027s the truth. I care about Dimitri. I was stupid to think I\u0027d be unaffected by him being back. But I realize now...\" Love fades. Mine has. \"I realize now that it\u0027s over with him. I\u0027m not saying that\u0027s easy to get past. It\u0027ll take a while, and I\u0027d be lying to both of us if I said it wouldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"That makes sense,\" Adrian said.\\n\\n \"It does?\"\\n\\n He glanced at me, a flicker of amusement in his eyes. \"Yes, little dhampir. Sometimes you make sense. Go on.\"\\n\\n \"I... well, like I said... I\u0027ve got to heal from him. But I do care about you.... I think I even love you a little.\" That got a small smile. \"I want to try again. I really do. I like having you in my life, but I may have jumped into things too soon before. You don\u0027t have any reason to want me after the way I\u0027ve dragged you around, but if you want to get together again, then I want to.\"\\n\\n He studied me for a long time, and my breath caught. I\u0027d meant what I said: He had every right to end things with us... and yet, the thought that he might terrified me.\\n\\n At last, he pulled me against him and lay back against the bed. \"Rose, I have all sorts of reasons to want you. I haven\u0027t been able to stay away from you since I saw you at the ski lodge.\"\\n\\n I shifted closer to Adrian on the bed and pressed my head against his chest. \"We can make this work. I know we can. If I screw up again, you can leave.\"\\n\\n \"If only it were that easy,\" he laughed. \"You forget: I have an addictive personality. I\u0027m addicted to you. Somehow I think you could do all sorts of bad things to me, and I\u0027d still come back to you. Just keep things honest, okay? Tell me what you\u0027re feeling. If you\u0027re feeling something for Dimitri that\u0027s confusing you, tell me. We\u0027ll work it out.\"\\n\\n I wanted to tell him that--regardless of my feelings--he had nothing to worry about with Dimitri because Dimitri had rejected me a number of times now. I could chase after Dimitri all I wanted, and it wouldn\u0027t do any good. Love fades. Those words still stung, and I couldn\u0027t bear to give voice to that pain. But as Adrian held me and I thought about how understanding he was about all of this, some wounded part of me acknowledged that the opposite was true as well: Love grows. I would try with him. I really would.\\n\\n I sighed. \"You\u0027re not supposed to be this wise. You\u0027re supposed to be shallow and unreasonable and... and...\"\\n\\n He pressed a kiss to my forehead. \"And?\"\\n\\n \"Mmm... ridiculous.\"\\n\\n \"Ridiculous I can manage. And the others... but only on special occasions.\"\\n\\n We were wrapped close together now, and I tilted my head to study him, the high cheekbones and artfully messy hair that made him so gorgeous. I remembered his mother\u0027s words, that regardless of what we wanted, he and I would eventually have to part ways. Maybe this was how my life was going to be. I\u0027d always lose the men I loved.\\n\\n I pulled him hard against me, kissing his mouth with a force that caught even him by surprise. If I had learned anything about life and love, it was that they were tenuous things that could end at any moment. Caution was essential--but not at the cost of wasting your life. I decided I wasn\u0027t going to waste it now.\\n\\n My hands were already tugging at Adrian\u0027s shirt before that thought was fully formed. He didn\u0027t question it or hesitate in taking my clothes off in return. He might have moments of profoundness and understanding, but he was still... well, Adrian. Adrian lived his life in the now, doing the things he wanted without much second-guessing. And he had wanted me for a very long time.\\n\\n He was also very good at this sort of thing, which was why my clothes came off faster than his. His lips were hot and eager against my throat, but he was careful to never once let his fangs brush my skin. I was a little less gentle, surprising myself when I dug my nails into the bare skin of his back. His lips moved lower, tracing the line of my collarbone while he deftly took off my bra one-handed.\\n\\n I was a little astonished at my body\u0027s reaction as we both fought to get the other\u0027s jeans off first. I\u0027d convinced myself that I\u0027d never want sex again after Dimitri, but right now? Oh, I wanted it. Maybe it was some psychological reaction to Dimitri\u0027s rejection. Maybe it was an impulse to live for the moment. Maybe it was love for Adrian. Or maybe it was just lust.\\n\\n Whatever it was, it made me powerless beneath his hands and mouth, which seemed intent on exploring every part of me. The only time he paused was when all my clothes were finally off and I lay there naked with him. He was almost naked too, but I hadn\u0027t quite gotten to his boxers yet. (They were silk because, honestly, what else would Adrian wear?). He cupped my face in his hands, his eyes filled with intensity and desire--and a bit of wonder.\\n\\n \"What are you, Rose Hathaway? Are you real? You\u0027re a dream within a dream. I\u0027m afraid touching you will make me wake up. You\u0027ll disappear.\" I recognized a little of the poetic trance he sometimes fell into, the spells that made me wonder if he was catching a little of the spirit-induced madness.\\n\\n \"Touch me and find out,\" I said, drawing him to me.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t hesitate again. The last of his clothes came off, and my whole body heated at the feel of his skin and the way his hands slid over me. My physical needs were rapidly trampling over any logic and reason. There was no thought, just us, and the fierce urgency bringing us together. I was all burning need and desire and sensation and--\\n\\n \"Oh, shit.\"\\n\\n It came out as kind of a mumble since we\u0027d been kissing, our lips eagerly seeking out the other\u0027s. With guardian reflexes, I barely managed to shift away, just as our hips started to come together. Losing the feel of him was shocking to me, more so for him. He was stunned, simply staring in astonishment as I wriggled further from him and finally managed a sitting position on the bed.\\n\\n \"What... what\u0027s wrong? Did you change your mind?\"\\n\\n \"We need protection first,\" I said. \"Do you have any condoms?\"\\n\\n He processed this for a few seconds and then sighed. \"Rose, only you would pick this instant to remember that.\"\\n\\n That was a fair point. My timing kind of sucked. Still, it was better than remembering it afterward. In spite of my body\u0027s rampant desire--and it was still there, believe me--I suddenly had a startling, vivid image of Dimitri\u0027s sister Karolina. I\u0027d met her in Siberia, and she\u0027d had a baby that was about six months old. The baby was adorable, as babies often are, but by God, she had been so much work. Karolina had a waitressing job, and as soon as she was home from that, her attention went to the baby. When she was at work, Dimitri\u0027s mother took care of the baby. And the baby always needed something: food, changing, rescue from choking on a small object. His sister Sonya had been on the verge of having a baby too, and with the way I\u0027d left things with his youngest sister, Viktoria, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised to find she was pregnant before long. Huge life changes made from small, careless actions.\\n\\n So I was pretty confident I didn\u0027t want a baby in my life right now, not this young. With Dimitri, it hadn\u0027t been a concern, thanks to dhampir infertility. With Adrian? It was an issue, as was the fact that while disease was rare among both our races, I wasn\u0027t the first girl Adrian had been with. Or the second. Or the third...\\n\\n \"So do you have any?\" I asked impatiently. Just because I was in responsible mode, it didn\u0027t mean I wanted sex any less.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Adrian, sitting up as well. \"Back in my bedroom.\"\\n\\n We stared at each other. His bedroom was far away, over in the Moroi section of Court.\\n\\n He slid nearer, putting his arm around me and nibbling my earlobe. \"The odds of anything bad happening are pretty low.\"\\n\\n I closed my eyes and tipped my head back against him. He wrapped his hands around my hips and stroked my skin. \"What are you, a doctor?\" I asked.\\n\\n He laughed softly, his mouth kissing the spot just behind my ear. \"No. I\u0027m just someone willing to take a risk. You can\u0027t tell me you don\u0027t want this.\"\\n\\n I opened my eyes and pulled away so that I could look at him directly. He was right. I did want this. Very, very badly. And the part of me--which was pretty much all of me--that burned with lust was attempting to win me over. The odds probably were low, right? Weren\u0027t there people who tried forever to get pregnant and couldn\u0027t? My desire had an okay argument, so it was kind of a surprise when my logic won.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t take the risk,\" I said.\\n\\n Now Adrian studied me, and at last, he nodded. \"Okay. Another time then. Tonight we\u0027ll be... responsible.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all you\u0027re going to say?\"\\n\\n He frowned. \"What else would I say? You said no.\"\\n\\n \"But you... you could have compelled me.\"\\n\\n Now he was really astonished. \"Do you want me to compel you?\"\\n\\n \"No. Of course not. It just occurred to me that... well, that you could have.\"\\n\\n Adrian cupped my face in his hands. \"Rose, I cheat at cards and buy liquor for minors. But I would never, ever force you into something you don\u0027t want. Certainly not this--\"\\n\\n His words were cut off because I\u0027d pressed myself against him and started kissing him again. Surprise must have kept him from doing anything right away, but soon, he pushed me away with what seemed like great reluctance.\\n\\n \"Little dhampir,\" he said dryly, \"if you want to be responsible, this is not a good way to do it.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have to let this go. And we can be responsible.\"\\n\\n \"All of those stories are--\"\\n\\n He came screeching to a halt when I tossed my hair out of the way and offered my neck to him. I managed to turn slightly so that I could meet his eyes, but I said nothing. I didn\u0027t have to. The invitation was obvious.\\n\\n \"Rose...\" he said uncertainly--though I could see the longing spring up in his face.\\n\\n Drinking blood wasn\u0027t the same as sex, but it was a yearning all vampires had, and doing it while aroused--so I\u0027d heard--was a mind-blowing experience. It was also taboo and hardly ever done, so people claimed. It was where the definition of blood whore had originated: dhampirs who gave their blood during sex. The idea of dhampirs yielding blood at all was considered disgraceful, but I\u0027d done it before: with Lissa when she needed food and with Dimitri when he\u0027d been Strigoi. And it had been glorious.\\n\\n He tried again, his voice steadier this time. \"Rose, do you know what you\u0027re asking?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said firmly. I gently ran a finger along his lips and then slipped in to touch his fangs. I threw his own words back at him. \"You can\u0027t tell me you don\u0027t want this.\"\\n\\n He did want it. In a heartbeat, his mouth was at my neck and his fangs were piercing my skin. I cried out at the sudden pain, a sound that softened to a moan as the endorphins that came with every vampire bite flooded into me. An exquisite bliss consumed me. He pulled me hard against him as he drank, almost onto his lap, pressing my back against his chest. I was distantly aware of his hands all over me again, of his lips upon my throat. Mostly, all I knew was that I was drowning in pure, ecstatic sweetness. The perfect high.\\n\\n When he pulled away, it was like losing part of myself. Like being incomplete. Confused, needing him back, I reached for him. He gently pushed my hand away, smiling as he licked his lips.\\n\\n \"Careful, little dhampir. I went longer than I should have. You could probably grow wings and fly off right now.\"\\n\\n It actually didn\u0027t sound like a bad idea. In a few more moments, though, the intense, crazy part of the high faded, and I settled back to myself. I still felt wonderful and dizzy; the endorphins had fed my body\u0027s desire. My reasoning slowly came back to me, allowing (kind of) coherent thought to penetrate that happy haze. When Adrian was convinced I was sober enough, he relaxed and lay down on the bed. I joined him a moment later, curling up against his side. He seemed as content as I was.\\n\\n \"That,\" he mused, \"was the best not-sex ever.\"\\n\\n My only response was a sleepy smile. It was late, and the more I crashed down from the endorphin rush, the drowsier I felt. Some tiny part of me said that even though I\u0027d wanted this and cared about Adrian, the whole act had been wrong. I hadn\u0027t done it for the right reasons, instead letting myself get carried away by my own grief and confusion.\\n\\n The rest of me decided that wasn\u0027t true, and the nagging voice soon faded into exhaustion. I fell asleep against Adrian, getting the best night of sleep I\u0027d had in a long time.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t entirely surprised that I was able to get out of bed, shower, get dressed, and even blow-dry my hair without Adrian waking up. My friends and I had spent many a morning trying to drag him out of bed in the past. Hungover or sober, he was a heavy sleeper.\\n\\n I spent more time on my hair than I had in a while. The telltale mark of a vampire bite was fresh on my neck. So I wore my hair down, careful to style it with a part so that the long waves hung heavy on the bite side. Satisfied the bruise would stay camouflaged, I pondered what to do next. In an hour or so, the Council was going to listen to arguments from factions with varying ideas on the new age decree, Moroi fighting, and the Dragomir vote. Provided they let me in the hall, I had no intention of missing the debates on the hottest issues in our world right now.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to wake up Adrian, though. He was tangled up in my sheets and slept peacefully. If I woke him up, I\u0027d feel obligated to stick around while he got ready. Through the bond, I felt Lissa sitting alone at a cafe table. I wanted to see her and have breakfast, so I decided Adrian could fend for himself. I left him a note about where I was, told him the door would lock on his way out, and drew lots of x\u0027s and o\u0027s.\\n\\n When I was halfway to the cafe, though, I sensed something that ruined my breakfast plan. Christian had sat down with Lissa.\\n\\n \"Well, well,\" I muttered. With everything else going on, I hadn\u0027t paid much attention to Lissa\u0027s personal life. After what had happened at the warehouse, I wasn\u0027t entirely surprised to see them together, though her feelings told me there had been no romantic reconciliation... yet. This was an uneasy attempt at friendship, a chance to get over their constant jealousy and distrust.\\n\\n Far be it from me to intrude on love at work. I knew another place near the guardians\u0027 buildings that also had coffee and doughnuts. It would do, provided no one there remembered that I was technically still on probation and had made a scene in a royal hall.\\n\\n The odds on that probably weren\u0027t good.\\n\\n Still, I decided to give it a try and headed over, eyeing the overcast sky uneasily. Rain wouldn\u0027t help my mood any. When I got to the cafe, I discovered I didn\u0027t have to worry about anyone paying attention to me. There was a bigger draw: Dimitri.\\n\\n He was out with his personal guard, and even though I was glad he had some freedom, the attitude that he needed close watching still angered me. At least there was no giant crowd today. People who came in for breakfast couldn\u0027t help but stare, but few lingered. He had five guardians with him this time, which was a significant reduction. That was a good sign. He sat alone at a table, coffee and a half-eaten glazed doughnut in front of him. He was reading a paperback novel that I would have bet my life was a Western.\\n\\n No one sat with him. His escort simply maintained a ring of protection, a couple near the walls, one at the entrance, and two at nearby tables. The security seemed pointless. Dimitri was completely engrossed in his book, oblivious to the guards and occasional spectators--or he was simply making a good show of not caring. He seemed very harmless, but Adrian\u0027s words came back to me. Was there any Strigoi left in him? Some dark part? Dimitri himself claimed he still carried the piece that prevented him from ever truly loving anyone.\\n\\n He and I had always had this uncanny awareness of each other. In a crowded room, I could always find him. And in spite of his preoccupation with the book, he looked up when I walked toward the cafe\u0027s counter. Our eyes met for a millisecond. There was no expression on his face... and yet, I had the feeling he was waiting for something.\\n\\n Me, I realized with a start. Despite everything, despite our fight in the church... he still thought I would pursue and make some pledge of my love. Why? Did he just expect me to be that unreasonable? Or was it possible... was it possible he wanted me to approach him?\\n\\n Well, whatever the reason, I decided I wouldn\u0027t give it to him. He\u0027d hurt me too many times already. He\u0027d told me to stay away, and if that was all part of some elaborate game to toy with my feelings, I wasn\u0027t going to play. I gave him a haughty look and turned away sharply as I walked up to the counter. I ordered chai and a chocolate eclair. After a moment\u0027s consideration, I ordered a second eclair. I had a feeling it was going to be one of those days.\\n\\n My plan had been to eat outside, but as I glanced toward the tinted windows, I could just barely make out the pattern of raindrops hitting the panes. Damn. I briefly considered fighting the weather and going somewhere else with my food, but I decided I wasn\u0027t going to let Dimitri scare me off. Spying a table far from him, I headed toward it, going out of my way not to look at or acknowledge him.\\n\\n \"Hey Rose. Are you going to the Council today?\"\\n\\n I came to a halt. One of Dimitri\u0027s guardians had spoken, giving me a friendly smile as he did. I couldn\u0027t recall the guy\u0027s name, but he\u0027d seemed nice whenever we passed each other. I didn\u0027t want to be rude, and so, reluctantly, I answered back--even though it meant staying near Dimitri.\\n\\n \"Yup,\" I said, making sure my attention was only on the guardian. \"Just grabbing a bite before I do.\"\\n\\n \"Are they going to let you in?\" asked another of the guardians. He too was smiling. For a moment, I thought they were mocking my last outburst. But no... that wasn\u0027t it. Their faces showed approval.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s an excellent question,\" I admitted. I took a bite of my eclair. \"But I figure I should give it a try. I\u0027ll also try to be on good behavior.\"\\n\\n The first guardian chuckled. \"I certainly hope not. That group deserves all the grief you can give them over that stupid age law.\" The other guardians nodded.\\n\\n \"What age law?\" asked Dimitri.\\n\\n Reluctantly, I looked over at him. As always, he swept my breath away. Stop it, Rose, I scolded myself. You\u0027re mad at him, remember? And now you\u0027ve chosen Adrian.\\n\\n \"The decree where royals think sending sixteen-year-old dhampirs out to fight Strigoi is the same as sending eighteen-year-olds,\" I said. I took another bite.\\n\\n Dimitri\u0027s head shot up so quickly, I nearly choked on my food. \"Which sixteen-year-olds are fighting Strigoi?\" His guardians tensed but did nothing else.\\n\\n It took me a moment to get the bite of eclair down. When I could finally speak, I was almost afraid to. \"That\u0027s the decree. Dhampirs graduate when they\u0027re sixteen now.\"\\n\\n \"When did this happen?\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"Just the other day. No one told you?\" I glanced over at the other guardians. One of them shrugged. I had the impression that they might believe Dimitri was truly a dhampir but that they weren\u0027t ready to get chatty with him. His only other social contact would have been Lissa and his interrogators.\\n\\n \"No.\" Dimitri\u0027s brow furrowed as he pondered the news.\\n\\n I ate my eclair in silence, hoping it would push him to talk more. It did.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s insane,\" he said. \"Morality aside, they aren\u0027t ready that young. It\u0027s suicide.\"\\n\\n \"I know. Tasha gave a really good argument against it. I did too.\"\\n\\n Dimitri gave me a suspicious look at that last part, particularly when a couple of his guardians smiled.\\n\\n \"Was it a close vote?\" he asked. He spoke to me interrogation style, in the serious and focused way that had so defined him as a guardian. It was a lot better than depression, I decided. It was also better than him telling me to go away.\\n\\n \"Very close. If Lissa could have voted, it wouldn\u0027t have passed.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" he said, playing with the edges of his coffee cup. \"The quorum.\"\\n\\n \"You know about that?\" I asked in surprise.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an old Moroi law.\"\\n\\n \"So I hear.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the opposition trying to do? Sway the Council back or get Lissa the Dragomir vote?\"\\n\\n \"Both. And other things.\"\\n\\n He shook his head, tucking some hair behind his ear. \"They can\u0027t do that. They need to pick one cause and throw their weight behind it. Lissa\u0027s the smartest choice. The Council needs the Dragomirs back, and I\u0027ve seen the way people look at her when they put me on display.\" Only the slightest edge of bitterness laced his words, indicating how he felt about that. Then it was back to business. \"It wouldn\u0027t be hard to get support for that--if they don\u0027t divide their efforts.\"\\n\\n I started in on my second eclair, forgetting about my earlier resolution to ignore him. I didn\u0027t want to distract him from the topic. It was the first thing that had brought the old fire back to his eyes, the only thing he seemed truly interested in--well, aside from pledging lifelong devotion to Lissa and telling me to stay out of his life. I liked this Dimitri.\\n\\n It was the same Dimitri from long ago, the fierce one who was willing to risk his life for what was right. I almost wished he\u0027d go back to being annoying, distant Dimitri, the one who told me to stay away. Seeing him now brought back too many memories--not to mention the attraction I thought I\u0027d smashed. Now, with that passion all over him, he seemed sexier than ever. He\u0027d worn that same intensity when we\u0027d fought together. Even when we\u0027d had sex. This was the way Dimitri was supposed to be: powerful and in charge. I was glad and yet... seeing him the way I loved only made my heart feel that much worse. He was lost to me.\\n\\n If Dimitri guessed my feelings, he didn\u0027t show it. He looked squarely at me, and, like always, the power of that gaze wrapped around me. \"The next time you see Tasha, will you send her to me? We need to talk about this.\"\\n\\n \"So, Tasha can be your friend, but not me?\" The sharp words were out before I could stop them. I flushed, embarrassed that I\u0027d lapsed in front of the other guardians. Dimitri apparently didn\u0027t want an audience either. He looked up at the one who had initially addressed me.\\n\\n \"Is there any way we could have some privacy?\"\\n\\n His escort exchanged looks, and then, almost as one being, they stepped back. It wasn\u0027t a considerable distance, and they still maintained a ring around Dimitri. Nonetheless, it was enough that all of our conversation wouldn\u0027t be overheard. Dimitri turned back to me. I sat down.\\n\\n \"You and Tasha have completely different situations. She can safely be in my life. You can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"And yet,\" I said with an angry toss of my hair, \"it\u0027s apparently okay for me to be in your life when it\u0027s convenient--say, like, running errands or passing messages.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t really seem like you need me in your life,\" he noted dryly, inclining his head slightly toward my right shoulder.\\n\\n It took me a moment to grasp what had happened. In tossing my hair, I\u0027d exposed my neck--and the bite. I tried not to blush again, knowing I had nothing to feel embarrassed about. I pushed the hair back.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s none of your business,\" I hissed, hoping the other guardians hadn\u0027t seen.\\n\\n \"Exactly.\" He sounded triumphant. \"Because you need to live your own life, far away from me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, for God\u0027s sake,\" I exclaimed. \"Will you stop with the--\"\\n\\n My eyes lifted from his face because an army suddenly descended upon us.\\n\\n Okay, it wasn\u0027t exactly an army, but it might as well have been. One minute it was just Dimitri, me, and his security, and then suddenly--the room was swarming with guardians. And not just any guardians. They wore the black-and-white outfits guardians often did for formal occasions, but a small red button on their collars marked them as guardians specifically attached to the queen\u0027s guard. There had to be at least twenty of them.\\n\\n They were lethal and deadly, the best of the best. Throughout history, assassins who had attacked monarchs had found themselves quickly taken down by the royal guard. They were walking death--and they were all gathering around us. Dimitri and I both shot up, unsure what was happening but certain the threat here was directed at us. His table and its chairs were between us, but we still immediately fell into the standard fighting stance when surrounded by enemies: Go back-to-back.\\n\\n Dimitri\u0027s security wore ordinary clothing and seemed a bit astonished to see their brethren, but with guardian efficiency, the escort promptly joined the advancing queen\u0027s guard. There were no more smiles or jokes. I wanted to throw myself in front of Dimitri, but in this situation, it was kind of difficult.\\n\\n \"You need to come with us right now,\" one of the queen\u0027s guards said. \"If you resist, we\u0027ll take you by force.\"\\n\\n \"Leave him alone!\" I yelled, looking from face to face. That angry darkness exploded within me. How could they still not believe? Why were they still coming after him? \"He hasn\u0027t done anything! Why can\u0027t you guys accept that he\u0027s really a dhampir now?\"\\n\\n The man who\u0027d spoken arched an eyebrow. \"I wasn\u0027t talking to him.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re... you\u0027re here for me?\" I asked. I tried to think of any new spectacles I might have caused recently. I considered the crazy idea that the queen had found out I\u0027d spent the night with Adrian and was pissed off about it. That was hardly enough to send the palace guard for me, though... or was it? Had I really gone too far with my antics?\\n\\n \"What for?\" demanded Dimitri. That tall, wonderful body of his--the one that could be so sensual sometimes--was filled with tension and menace now.\\n\\n The man kept his gaze on me, ignoring Dimitri. \"Don\u0027t make me repeat myself: Come with us quietly, or we will make you.\" The glimmer of handcuffs showed in his hands.\\n\\n My eyes went wide. \"That\u0027s crazy! I\u0027m not going anywhere until you tell me how the hell this--\"\\n\\n That was the point at which they apparently decided I wasn\u0027t coming quietly. Two of the royal guardians lunged for me, and even though we technically worked for the same side, my instincts kicked in. I didn\u0027t understand anything here except that I would not be dragged away like some kind of master criminal. I shoved the chair I\u0027d been sitting in earlier at one of the guardians and aimed a punch at the other. It was a sloppy throw, made worse because he was taller than me. That height difference allowed me to dodge his next grab, and when I kicked hard at his legs, a small grunt told me I\u0027d hit home.\\n\\n I heard a few scattered screams. The people working at the cafe ducked behind their counter like they expected automatic weapons to come out. The other patrons who\u0027d been eating breakfast hurriedly sprang from their tables, heedlessly knocking over food and dishes. They ran for the exits--exits that were blocked by still more guardians. This brought more screams, even though the exits were being cut off because of me.\\n\\n Meanwhile, other guardians were joining the fray. Although I got a couple of good punches in, I knew the numbers were too overwhelming. One guardian caught hold of my arm and began trying to put the cuffs on me. He stopped when another set of hands grabbed me from the other side and jerked me away.\\n\\n Dimitri.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t touch her,\" he growled.\\n\\n There was a note in his voice that would have scared me if it had been directed toward me. He shoved me behind him, putting his body protectively in front of mine with my back to the table. Guardians came at us from all directions, and Dimitri began dispatching them with the same deadly grace that had once made people call him a god. He didn\u0027t kill any of the ones he fought, but he made sure they were out of action. If anyone thought his ordeals as a Strigoi or being locked up had diminished his fighting ability, they were terribly mistaken. Dimitri was a force of nature, managing to take on both impossible odds and stop me each time I tried to join the fight. The queen\u0027s guards might have been the best of the best, but Dimitri... well, my former lover and instructor was in a category all his own. His fighting skills were beyond anyone else\u0027s, and he was using them all in defense of me.\\n\\n \"Stay back,\" he ordered me. \"They aren\u0027t laying a hand on you.\"\\n\\n At first, I was overwhelmed by his protectiveness--even though I hated not being part of a fight. Watching him fight again was also entrancing. He made it look beautiful and lethal at the same time. He was a one-man army, the kind of warrior that protected his loved ones and brought terror to his enemies--\\n\\n And that\u0027s when a horrible revelation hit me.\\n\\n \"Stop!\" I suddenly yelled. \"I\u0027ll come! I\u0027ll come with you!\"\\n\\n No one heard me at first. They were too involved with the fight. Guardians kept trying to sneak behind Dimitri, but he seemed to sense them and would shove chairs or anything else he could get a hold of at them--while still managing to kick and punch those coming at us head-on. Who knew? Maybe he really could have taken on an army by himself.\\n\\n But I couldn\u0027t let him.\\n\\n I shook Dimitri\u0027s arm. \"Stop,\" I repeated. \"Don\u0027t fight anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Rose--\"\\n\\n \"Stop!\"\\n\\n I was pretty sure I\u0027d never screamed any word so loudly in my life. It rang through the room. For all I knew, it rang through the entire Court.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t exactly make everyone come to a halt, but many of the guardians slowed down. A few of the cowering cafe workers peered over the counter at us. Dimitri was still in motion, still ready to take everyone on, and I had to practically throw myself at him to get him to notice me.\\n\\n \"Stop.\" This time, my voice was a whisper. An uneasy silence had fallen over everyone. \"Don\u0027t fight them anymore. I\u0027m going to go with them.\"\\n\\n \"No. I won\u0027t let them take you.\"\\n\\n \"You have to,\" I begged.\\n\\n He was breathing hard, every part of him braced and ready to attack. We locked gazes, and a thousand messages seemed to flow between us as the old electricity crackled in the air. I just hoped he got the right message.\\n\\n One of the guardians tentatively stepped forward--having to go around the unconscious body of his colleague--and Dimitri\u0027s tension snapped. He started to block the guardian and defend me again, but I instead put myself between them, clasping Dimitri\u0027s hand and still looking into his eyes. His skin was warm and felt so, so right touching mine.\\n\\n \"Please. No more.\"\\n\\n I saw then that he finally understood what I was trying to say. People were still afraid of him. No one knew what he was. Lissa had said him behaving calmly and normally would soothe fears. But this? Him taking on an army of guardians? That was not going to get him points for good behavior. For all I knew, it was already too late after this, but I had to attempt damage control. I couldn\u0027t let them lock him up again--not because of me.\\n\\n As he looked at me, he seemed to send a message of his own: that he would still fight for me, that he would fight until he collapsed to keep them from taking me.\\n\\n I shook my head and gave his hand a parting squeeze. His fingers were exactly as I remembered, long and graceful, with calluses built up from years of training. I let go and turned to face the guy who had originally spoken. I assumed he was some sort of leader.\\n\\n I held out my hands and slowly stepped forward. \"I\u0027ll go quietly. But, please... don\u0027t lock him back up. He just thought... he just thought I was in trouble.\"\\n\\n The thing was, as the handcuffs were clamped onto my wrists, I was starting to think I was in trouble too. As the guardians helped each other up, their leader took a deep breath and made the proclamation he\u0027d been trying to make since entering. I swallowed, waiting to hear Victor\u0027s name.\\n\\n \"Rose Hathaway, you are under arrest for high treason.\"\\n\\n Not quite what I\u0027d expected. Hoping my submission had earned me points, I asked, \"What kind of high treason?\"\\n\\n \"The murder of Her Royal Majesty, Queen Tatiana.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/spirit-bound-vampire-academy-5/page-25.html","bookId":2064,"book":{"id":2064,"title":"Spirit Bound (Vampire Academy #5)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 5: Spirit Bound \\n Spirit Bound is the fifth book in the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead.
