and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. \\n\\n [bbe] The porter lets him in; and the sheep give ear to his voice; he says over the names of the sheep, and takes them out. \\n\\n 10:4 [hgb] 既 放 出 自 己 的 羊 来 ， 就 在 前 头 走 ， 羊 也 跟 着 他 ， 因 为 认 得 他 的 声 音 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. \\n\\n [bbe] When he has got them all out, he goes before them, and the sheep go after him, for they have knowledge of his voice. \\n\\n 10:5 [hgb] 羊 不 跟 着 生 人 ， 因 为 不 认 得 他 的 声 音 。 必 要 逃 跑 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. \\n\\n [bbe] They will not go after another who is not their keeper, but will go from him in flight, because his voice is strange to them. \\n\\n 10:6 [hgb] 耶 稣 将 这 比 喻 告 诉 他 们 。 但 他 们 不 明 白 所 说 的 是 什 么 意 思 。 \\n\\n [kjv] This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] In this Jesus was teaching them in the form of a story: but what he said was not clear to them. \\n\\n 10:7 [hgb] 所 以 耶 稣 又 对 他 们 说 ， 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 就 是 羊 的 门 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. \\n\\n [bbe] So Jesus said again, Truly I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. \\n\\n 10:8 [hgb] 凡 在 我 以 先 来 的 ， 都 是 贼 ， 是 强 盗 。 羊 却 不 听 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. \\n\\n [bbe] All who came before me are thieves and outlaws: but the sheep did not give ear to them. \\n\\n 10:9 [hgb] 我 就 是 门 。 凡 从 我 进 来 的 ， 必 然 得 救 ， 并 且 出 入 得 草 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. \\n\\n [bbe] I am the door: if any man goes in through me he will have salvation, and will go in and go out, and will get food. \\n\\n 10:10 [hgb] 盗 贼 来 ， 无 非 要 偷 窃 ， 杀 害 ， 毁 坏 。 我 来 了 ， 是 要 叫 羊 （ 或 作 人 ） 得 生 命 ， 并 且 得 的 更 丰 盛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. \\n\\n [bbe] The thief comes only to take the sheep and to put them to death: he comes for their destruction: I have come so that they may have life and have it in greater measure. \\n\\n 10:11 [hgb] 我 是 好 牧 人 ， 好 牧 人 为 羊 舍 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. \\n\\n [bbe] I am the good keeper of sheep: the good keeper gives his life for the sheep. \\n\\n 10:12 [hgb] 若 是 雇 工 ， 不 是 牧 人 ， 羊 也 不 是 他 自 己 的 ， 他 看 见 狼 来 ， 就 撇 下 羊 逃 走 。 狼 抓 住 羊 ， 赶 散 了 羊 群 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. \\n\\n [bbe] He who is a servant, and not the keeper or the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming and goes in flight, away from the sheep; and the wolf comes down on them and sends them in all directions: \\n\\n 10:13 [hgb] 雇 工 逃 走 ， 因 他 是 雇 工 ， 并 不 顾 念 羊 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. \\n\\n [bbe] Because he is a servant he has no interest in the sheep. \\n\\n 10:14 [hgb] 我 是 好 牧 人 。 我 认 识 我 的 羊 ， 我 的 羊 也 认 识 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. \\n\\n [bbe] I am the good keeper; I have knowledge of my sheep, and they have knowledge of me, \\n\\n 10:15 [hgb] 正 如 父 认 识 我 ， 我 也 认 识 父 一 样 。 并 且 我 为 羊 舍 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. \\n\\n [bbe] Even as the Father has knowledge of me and I of the Father; and I am giving my life for the sheep. \\n\\n 10:16 [hgb] 我 另 外 有 羊 ， 不 是 这 圈 里 的 。 我 必 须 领 他 们 来 ， 他 们 也 要 听 我 的 声 音 。 并 且 要 合 成 一 群 ， 归 一 个 牧 人 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. \\n\\n [bbe] And I have other sheep which are not of this field: I will be their guide in the same way, and they will give ear to my voice, so there will be one flock and one keeper. \\n\\n 10:17 [hgb] 我 父 爱 我 ， 因 我 将 命 舍 去 ， 好 再 取 回 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. \\n\\n [bbe] For this reason am I loved by the Father, because I give up my life so that I may take it again. \\n\\n 10:18 [hgb] 没 有 人 夺 我 的 命 去 ， 是 我 自 己 舍 的 。 我 有 权 柄 舍 了 ， 也 有 权 柄 取 回 来 。 这 是 我 从 我 父 所 受 的 命 令 。 \\n\\n [kjv] No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. \\n\\n [bbe] No one takes it away from me; I give it up of myself. I have power to give it up, and I have power to take it again. These orders I have from my Father. \\n\\n 10:19 [hgb] 犹 太 人 为 这 些 话 ， 又 起 了 纷 争 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. \\n\\n [bbe] There was a division again among the Jews because of these words. \\n\\n 10:20 [hgb] 内 中 有 好 些 人 说 ， 他 是 被 鬼 附 着 ， 而 且 疯 了 。 为 什 么 听 他 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? \\n\\n [bbe] And a number of them said, He has an evil spirit and is out of his mind; why do you give ear to him? \\n\\n 10:21 [hgb] 又 有 人 说 ， 这 不 是 鬼 附 之 人 所 说 的 话 。 鬼 岂 能 叫 瞎 子 的 眼 睛 开 了 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? \\n\\n [bbe] Others said, These are not the words of one who has an evil spirit. Is it possible for an evil spirit to make blind people see? \\n\\n 10:22 [hgb] 在 耶 路 撒 冷 有 修 殿 节 。 是 冬 天 的 时 候 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. \\n\\n [bbe] Then came the feast of the opening of the Temple in Jerusalem: it was winter; \\n\\n 10:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 在 殿 里 所 罗 门 的 廊 下 行 走 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon\u0027s porch. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus was walking in the Temple, in Solomon\u0027s covered way. \\n\\n 10:24 [hgb] 犹 太 人 围 着 他 ， 说 ， 你 叫 我 们 犹 疑 不 定 到 几 时 呢 ？ 你 若 是 基 督 ， 就 明 明 地 告 诉 我 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the Jews came round him, saying, how long are you going to keep us in doubt? If you are the Christ, say so clearly. \\n\\n 10:25 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 已 经 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 不 信 。 我 奉 我 父 之 名 所 行 的 事 ， 可 以 为 我 作 见 证 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father\u0027s name, they bear witness of me. \\n\\n [bbe] Jesus said in answer, I have said it and you have no belief: the works which I do in my Father\u0027s name, these give witness about me. \\n\\n 10:26 [hgb] 只 是 你 们 不 信 ， 因 为 你 们 不 是 我 的 羊 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. \\n\\n [bbe] But you have no belief because you are not of my sheep. \\n\\n 10:27 [hgb] 我 的 羊 听 我 的 声 音 ， 我 也 认 识 他 们 ， 他 们 也 跟 着 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: \\n\\n [bbe] My sheep give ear to my voice, and I have knowledge of them, and they come after me: \\n\\n 10:28 [hgb] 我 又 赐 给 他 们 永 生 。 他 们 永 不 灭 亡 ， 谁 也 不 能 从 我 手 里 把 他 们 夺 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. \\n\\n [bbe] And I give them eternal life; they will never come to destruction, and no one will ever take them out of my hand. \\n\\n 10:29 [hgb] 我 父 把 羊 赐 给 我 ， 他 比 万 有 都 大 。 谁 也 不 能 从 我 父 手 里 把 他 们 夺 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father\u0027s hand. \\n\\n [bbe] That which my Father has given to me has more value than all; and no one is able to take anything out of the Father\u0027s hand. \\n\\n 10:30 [hgb] 我 与 父 原 为 一 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I and my Father are one. \\n\\n [bbe] I and my Father are one. \\n\\n 10:31 [hgb] 犹 太 人 又 拿 起 石 头 来 要 打 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the Jews took up stones again to send at him. \\n\\n 10:32 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 我 从 父 显 出 许 多 善 事 给 你 们 看 ， 你 们 是 为 哪 一 件 拿 石 头 打 我 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? \\n\\n [bbe] Jesus said to them in answer, I have let you see a number of good works from the Father; for which of those works are you stoning me? \\n\\n 10:33 [hgb] 犹 太 人 回 答 说 ， 我 们 不 是 为 善 事 拿 石 头 打 你 ， 是 为 你 说 僭 妄 的 话 。 又 为 你 是 个 人 ， 反 将 自 己 当 作 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. \\n\\n [bbe] This was their answer: We are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words; because being a man you make yourself God. \\n\\n 10:34 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 的 律 法 上 岂 不 是 写 着 ， 我 曾 说 你 们 是 神 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? \\n\\n [bbe] In answer, Jesus said, Is there not a saying in your law, I said, You are gods? \\n\\n 10:35 [hgb] 经 上 的 话 是 不 能 废 的 。 若 那 些 承 受 神 道 的 人 ， 尚 且 称 为 神 ， \\n\\n [kjv] If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; \\n\\n [bbe] If he said they were gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Writings may not be broken), \\n\\n 10:36 [hgb] 父 所 分 别 为 圣 ， 又 差 到 世 间 来 的 ， 他 自 称 是 神 的 儿 子 ， 你 们 还 向 他 说 ， 你 说 僭 妄 的 话 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? \\n\\n [bbe] Do you say of him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world, Your words are evil; because I said, I am God\u0027s Son? \\n\\n 10:37 [hgb] 我 若 不 行 我 父 的 事 ， 你 们 就 不 必 信 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. \\n\\n [bbe] If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not have belief in me; \\n\\n 10:38 [hgb] 我 若 行 了 ， 你 们 纵 然 不 信 我 ， 也 当 信 这 些 事 。 叫 你 们 又 知 道 ， 又 明 白 ， 父 在 我 里 面 ， 我 也 在 父 里 面 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. \\n\\n [bbe] But if I am doing them, then have belief in the works even if you have no belief in me; so that you may see clearly and be certain that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. \\n\\n 10:39 [hgb] 他 们 又 要 拿 他 。 他 却 逃 出 他 们 的 手 走 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, \\n\\n [bbe] Then again they made an attempt to take him; but he got away from them. \\n\\n 10:40 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 往 约 但 河 外 去 ， 到 了 约 翰 起 初 施 洗 的 地 方 ， 就 住 在 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. \\n\\n [bbe] And he went again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John first gave baptism; and he was there for a time. \\n\\n 10:41 [hgb] 有 许 多 人 来 到 他 那 里 。 他 们 说 约 翰 一 件 神 迹 没 有 行 过 。 但 约 翰 指 着 这 人 所 说 的 一 切 话 都 是 真 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. \\n\\n [bbe] And a great number of people came to him, saying, John did no sign: but everything John said of this man was true. \\n\\n 10:42 [hgb] 在 那 里 信 耶 稣 的 人 就 多 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And many believed on him there. \\n\\n [bbe] And a number came to have faith in him there. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/157/2173.html","bookId":101,"book":{"id":101,"title":"约翰福音 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 太 初 有 道 ， 道 与 神 同 在 ， 道 就 是 神 。 [kjv] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
