\n [bbe] And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him with the question, Who are you? \n 1:20 [hgb] 他 就 明 说 ， 并 不 隐 瞒 。 明 说 ， 我 不 是 基 督 。 \n [kjv] And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. \n [bbe] He said quite openly and straightforwardly, I am not the Christ. \n 1:21 [hgb] 他 们 又 问 他 说 ， 这 样 你 是 谁 呢 ？ 是 以 利 亚 吗 ？ 他 说 ， 我 不 是 。 是 那 先 知 吗 ？ 他 回 答 说 ， 不 是 。 \n [kjv] And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. \n [bbe] And they said to him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And his answer was, I am not. \n 1:22 [hgb] 于 是 他 们 说 ， 你 到 底 是 谁 ？ 叫 我 们 好 回 覆 差 我 们 来 的 人 。 你 自 己 说 ， 你 是 谁 。 \n [kjv] Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? \n [bbe] So they said to him, Who are you then? We have to give some answer to those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself? \n 1:23 [hgb] 他 说 ， 我 就 是 那 在 旷 野 有 人 声 喊 着 说 ， 修 直 主 的 道 路 ， 正 如 先 知 以 赛 亚 所 说 的 。 \n [kjv] He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. \n [bbe] He said, I am the voice of one crying in the waste land, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet. \n 1:24 [hgb] 那 些 人 是 法 利 赛 人 差 来 的 。 （ 或 作 那 差 来 的 是 法 利 赛 人 ） \n [kjv] And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. \n [bbe] Those who had been sent came from the Pharisees. \n 1:25 [hgb] 他 们 就 问 他 说 ， 你 既 不 是 基 督 ， 不 是 以 利 亚 ， 也 不 是 那 先 知 ， 为 什 么 施 洗 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? \n [bbe] And they put this question to him, saying, Why then are you giving baptism if you are not the Christ, or Elijah, or the prophet? \n 1:26 [hgb] 约 翰 回 答 说 ， 我 是 用 水 施 洗 ， 但 有 一 位 站 在 你 们 中 间 ， 是 你 们 不 认 识 的 ， \n [kjv] John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; \n [bbe] John\u0027s answer was: I give baptism with water; but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge; \n 1:27 [hgb] 就 是 那 在 我 以 后 来 的 ， 我 给 他 解 鞋 带 ， 也 不 配 。 \n [kjv] He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe\u0027s latchet I am not worthy to unloose. \n [bbe] It is he who is coming after me; I am not good enough to undo his shoes. \n 1:28 [hgb] 这 是 在 约 但 河 外 ， 伯 大 尼 ， （ 有 古 卷 作 伯 大 巴 喇 ） 约 翰 施 洗 的 地 方 作 的 见 证 。 \n [kjv] These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. \n [bbe] These things took place at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was giving baptism. \n 1:29 [hgb] 次 日 ， 约 翰 看 见 耶 稣 来 到 他 那 里 ， 就 说 ， 看 哪 ， 神 的 羔 羊 ， 除 去 （ 或 作 背 负 ） 世 人 罪 孽 的 。 \n [kjv] The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. \n [bbe] The day after, John sees Jesus coming to him and says, See, here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! \n 1:30 [hgb] 这 就 是 我 曾 说 ， 有 一 位 在 我 以 后 来 ， 反 成 了 在 我 以 前 的 。 因 他 本 来 在 我 以 前 。 \n [kjv] This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. \n [bbe] This is he of whom I said, One is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me. \n 1:31 [hgb] 我 先 前 不 认 识 他 ， 如 今 我 来 用 水 施 洗 ， 为 要 叫 他 显 明 给 以 色 列 人 。 \n [kjv] And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. \n [bbe] I myself had no knowledge of him, but I came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by Israel. \n 1:32 [hgb] 约 翰 又 作 见 证 说 ， 我 曾 看 见 圣 灵 ， 仿 佛 鸽 子 从 天 降 下 ， 住 在 他 的 身 上 。 \n [kjv] And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. \n [bbe] And John gave this witness, saying, I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him. \n 1:33 [hgb] 我 先 前 不 认 识 他 。 只 是 那 差 我 来 用 水 施 洗 的 ， 对 我 说 ， 你 看 见 圣 灵 降 下 来 ， 住 在 谁 的 身 上 ， 谁 就 是 用 圣 灵 施 洗 的 。 \n [kjv] And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. \n [bbe] I had no knowledge who he was, but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting, it is he who gives baptism with the Holy Spirit. \n 1:34 [hgb] 我 看 见 了 ， 就 证 明 这 是 神 的 儿 子 。 \n [kjv] And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. \n [bbe] This I saw myself and my witness is that he is the Son of God. \n 1:35 [hgb] 再 次 日 ， 约 翰 同 两 个 门 徒 站 在 那 里 。 \n [kjv] Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; \n [bbe] The day after, John was there again with two of his disciples; \n 1:36 [hgb] 他 见 耶 稣 行 走 ， 就 说 ， 看 哪 ， 这 是 神 的 羔 羊 。 \n [kjv] And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! \n [bbe] And looking at Jesus while he was walking he said, See, there is the Lamb of God! \n 1:37 [hgb] 两 个 门 徒 听 见 他 的 话 ， 就 跟 从 了 耶 稣 。 \n [kjv] And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. \n [bbe] Hearing what he said, the two disciples went after Jesus. \n 1:38 [hgb] 耶 稣 转 过 身 来 ， 看 见 他 们 跟 着 ， 就 问 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 什 么 ？ 他 们 说 ， 拉 比 ， 在 哪 里 住 ？ （ 拉 比 翻 出 来 ， 就 是 夫 子 ） \n [kjv] Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? \n [bbe] And Jesus, turning round, saw them coming after him and said to them, What are you looking for? They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, Master), where are you living? \n 1:39 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 来 看 。 他 们 就 去 看 他 在 哪 里 住 ， 这 一 天 便 与 他 同 住 ， 那 时 约 有 申 正 了 。 \n [kjv] He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. \n [bbe] He said to them, Come and see. They went with him then and saw where he was living; and they were with him all that day: it was then about the tenth hour of the day. \n 1:40 [hgb] 听 见 约 翰 的 话 ， 跟 从 耶 稣 的 那 两 个 人 ， 一 个 是 西 门 彼 得 的 兄 弟 安 得 烈 。 \n [kjv] One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter\u0027s brother. \n [bbe] Andrew, Simon Peter\u0027s brother, was one of the two men who, hearing what John said, went after Jesus. \n 1:41 [hgb] 他 先 找 着 自 己 的 哥 哥 西 门 ， 对 他 说 ， 我 们 遇 见 弥 赛 亚 了 ， （ 弥 赛 亚 翻 出 来 ， 就 是 基 督 ） \n [kjv] He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. \n [bbe] Early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him, We have made discovery! It is the Messiah! (which is to say, the Christ). \n 1:42 [hgb] 于 是 领 他 去 见 耶 稣 。 耶 稣 看 着 他 说 ， 你 是 约 翰 的 儿 子 西 门 ， （ 约 翰 马 太 十 六 章 十 七 节 称 约 拿 ） 你 要 称 为 矶 法 。 （ 矶 法 翻 出 来 ， 就 是 彼 得 ） \n [kjv] And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. \n [bbe] And he took him to Jesus. Looking at him fixedly Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; your name will be Cephas (which is to say, Peter). \n 1:43 [hgb] 又 次 日 ， 耶 稣 想 要 往 加 利 利 去 ， 遇 见 腓 力 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 来 跟 从 我 吧 。 \n [kjv] The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. \n [bbe] The day after this, Jesus had a desire to go into Galilee. He came across Philip and said to him, Come and be my disciple. \n 1:44 [hgb] 这 腓 力 是 伯 赛 大 人 ， 和 安 得 烈 、 彼 得 同 城 。 \n [kjv] Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. \n [bbe] Now Philip\u0027s town was Beth-saida, where Andrew and Peter came from. \n 1:45 [hgb] 腓 力 找 着 拿 但 业 ， 对 他 说 ， 摩 西 在 律 法 上 所 写 的 ， 和 众 先 知 所 记 的 那 一 位 ， 我 们 遇 见 了 ， 就 是 约 瑟 的 儿 子 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 。 \n [kjv] Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. \n [bbe] Philip came across Nathanael and said to him, We have made a discovery! It is he of whom Moses, in the law, and the prophets were writing, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. \n 1:46 [hgb] 拿 但 业 对 他 说 ， 拿 撒 勒 还 能 出 什 么 好 的 吗 ？ 腓 力 说 ， 你 来 看 。 \n [kjv] And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. \n [bbe] Nazareth! said Nathanael, Is it possible for any good to come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see. \n 1:47 [hgb] 耶 稣 看 见 拿 但 业 来 ， 就 指 着 他 说 ， 看 哪 ， 这 是 个 真 以 色 列 人 ， 他 心 里 是 没 有 诡 诈 的 。 \n [kjv] Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! \n [bbe] Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, See, here is a true son of Israel in whom there is nothing false. \n 1:48 [hgb] 拿 但 业 对 耶 稣 说 ， 你 从 哪 里 知 道 我 呢 ？ 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 腓 力 还 没 有 招 呼 你 ， 你 在 无 花 果 树 底 下 ， 我 就 看 见 你 了 。 \n [kjv] Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. \n [bbe] Nathanael said to him, Where did you get knowledge of me? In answer Jesus said, Before Philip was talking with you, while you were still under the fig-tree, I saw you. \n 1:49 [hgb] 拿 但 业 说 ， 拉 比 ， 你 是 神 的 儿 子 ， 你 是 以 色 列 的 王 。 \n [kjv] Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. \n [bbe] Nathanael said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel! \n 1:50 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 因 为 我 说 在 无 花 果 树 底 下 看 见 你 ， 你 就 信 吗 ？ 你 将 要 看 见 比 这 更 大 的 事 。 \n [kjv] Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. \n [bbe] In answer Jesus said to him, You have faith because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree. You will see greater things than these. \n 1:51 [hgb] 又 说 ， 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 将 要 看 见 天 开 了 ， 神 的 使 者 上 去 下 来 在 人 子 身 上 。 \n [kjv] And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. \n [bbe] And he said to him, Truly I say to you all, You will see heaven opening and God\u0027s angels going up and coming down on the Son of man. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/157/2164.html","bookId":101,"book":{"id":101,"title":"约翰福音 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 太 初 有 道 ， 道 与 神 同 在 ， 道 就 是 神 。 [kjv] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
