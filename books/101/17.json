[bbe] Even as you gave him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all those whom you have given to him. 17:3 [hgb] 认 识 你 独 一 的 真 神 ， 并 且 认 识 你 所 差 来 的 耶 稣 基 督 ， 这 就 是 永 生 。 [kjv] And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. [bbe] And this is eternal life: to have knowledge of you, the only true God, and of him whom you have sent, even Jesus Christ. 17:4 [hgb] 我 在 地 上 已 经 荣 耀 你 ， 你 所 托 付 我 的 事 ， 我 已 成 全 了 。 [kjv] I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. [bbe] I have given you glory on the earth, having done all the work which you gave me to do. 17:5 [hgb] 父 阿 ， 现 在 求 你 使 我 同 你 享 荣 耀 ， 就 是 未 有 世 界 以 先 ， 我 同 你 所 有 的 荣 耀 。 [kjv] And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. [bbe] And now, Father, let me have glory with you, even that glory which I had with you before the world was. 17:6 [hgb] 你 从 世 上 赐 给 我 的 人 ， 我 已 将 你 的 名 显 明 与 他 们 。 他 们 本 是 你 的 ， 你 将 他 们 赐 给 我 ， 他 们 也 遵 守 了 你 的 道 。 [kjv] I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. [bbe] I have given knowledge of your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world: yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your words. 17:7 [hgb] 如 今 他 们 知 道 ， 凡 你 所 赐 给 我 的 ， 都 是 从 你 那 里 来 的 。 [kjv] Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. [bbe] Now it is clear to them that whatever you have given to me comes from you: 17:8 [hgb] 因 为 你 所 赐 给 我 的 道 ， 我 已 经 赐 给 他 们 。 他 们 也 领 受 了 ， 又 确 实 知 道 ， 我 是 从 你 出 来 的 ， 并 且 信 你 差 了 我 来 。 [kjv] For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. [bbe] Because I have given them the words which you gave to me; and they have taken them to heart, and have certain knowledge that I came from you, and they have faith that you sent me. 17:9 [hgb] 我 为 他 们 祈 求 。 不 为 世 人 祈 求 ， 却 为 你 所 赐 给 我 的 人 祈 求 ， 因 他 们 本 是 你 的 。 [kjv] I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. [bbe] My prayer is for them: my prayer is not for the world, but for those whom you have given to me, because they are yours 17:10 [hgb] 凡 是 我 的 都 是 你 的 ， 你 的 也 是 我 的 。 并 且 我 因 他 们 得 了 荣 耀 。 [kjv] And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. [bbe] (All mine are yours, and yours are mine) and I have glory in them. 17:11 [hgb] 从 今 以 后 ， 我 不 在 世 上 ， 他 们 却 在 世 上 ， 我 往 你 那 里 去 。 圣 父 阿 ， 求 你 因 你 所 赐 给 我 的 名 保 守 他 们 ， 叫 他 们 合 而 为 一 ， 像 我 们 一 样 。 [kjv] And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. [bbe] And now I will be no longer in the world, but they are in the world and I come to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name which you have given to me, so that they may be one even as we are one. 17:12 [hgb] 我 与 他 们 同 在 的 时 候 ， 因 你 所 赐 给 我 的 名 ， 保 守 了 他 们 ， 我 也 护 卫 了 他 们 ， 其 中 除 了 那 灭 亡 之 子 ， 没 有 一 个 灭 亡 的 。 好 叫 经 上 的 话 得 应 验 。 [kjv] While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. [bbe] While I was with them I kept them safe in your name which you have given to me: I took care of them and not one of them has come to destruction, but only the son of destruction, so that the Writings might come true. 17:13 [hgb] 现 在 我 往 你 那 里 去 。 我 还 在 世 上 说 这 话 ， 是 叫 他 们 心 里 充 满 我 的 喜 乐 。 [kjv] And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. [bbe] And now I come to you; and these things I say in the world so that they may have my joy complete in them. 17:14 [hgb] 我 已 将 你 的 道 赐 给 他 们 。 世 界 又 恨 他 们 ， 因 为 他 们 不 属 世 界 ， 正 如 我 不 属 世 界 一 样 。 [kjv] I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. [bbe] I have given your word to them; and they are hated by the world, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 17:15 [hgb] 我 不 求 你 叫 他 们 离 开 世 界 ， 只 求 你 保 守 他 们 脱 离 那 恶 者 。 （ 或 作 脱 离 罪 恶 ） [kjv] I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. [bbe] My prayer is not that you will take them out of the world, but that you will keep them from the Evil One. 17:16 [hgb] 他 们 不 属 世 界 ， 正 如 我 不 属 世 界 一 样 。 [kjv] They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. [bbe] They are not of the world any more than I am of the world. 17:17 [hgb] 求 你 用 真 理 使 他 们 成 圣 。 你 的 道 就 是 真 理 。 [kjv] Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. [bbe] Make them holy by the true word: your word is the true word. 17:18 [hgb] 你 怎 样 差 我 到 世 上 ， 我 也 照 样 差 他 们 到 世 上 。 [kjv] As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. [bbe] Even as you have sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. 17:19 [hgb] 我 为 他 们 的 缘 故 ， 自 己 分 别 为 圣 ， 叫 他 们 也 因 真 理 成 圣 。 [kjv] And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. [bbe] And for them I make myself holy, so that they may be made truly holy. 17:20 [hgb] 我 不 但 为 这 些 人 祈 求 ， 也 为 那 些 因 他 们 的 话 信 我 的 人 祈 求 。 [kjv] Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; [bbe] My prayer is not for them only, but for all who will have faith in me through their word; 17:21 [hgb] 使 他 们 都 合 而 为 一 。 正 如 你 父 在 我 里 面 ， 我 在 你 里 面 ， 使 他 们 也 在 我 们 里 面 。 叫 世 人 可 以 信 你 差 了 我 来 。 [kjv] That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. [bbe] May they all be one! Even as you, Father, are in me and I am in you, so let them be in us, so that all men may come to have faith that you sent me. 17:22 [hgb] 你 所 赐 给 我 的 荣 耀 ， 我 已 赐 给 他 们 ， 使 他 们 合 而 为 一 ， 像 我 们 合 而 为 一 。 [kjv] And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: [bbe] And the glory which you have given to me I have given to them, so that they may be one even as we are one; 17:23 [hgb] 我 在 他 们 里 面 ， 你 在 我 里 面 ， 使 他 们 完 完 全 全 的 合 而 为 一 。 叫 世 人 知 道 你 差 了 我 来 ， 也 知 道 你 爱 他 们 如 同 爱 我 一 样 。 [kjv] I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. [bbe] I in them, and you in me, so that they may be made completely one, and so that it may become clear to all men that you have sent me and that they are loved by you as I am loved by you. 17:24 [hgb] 父 阿 ， 我 在 哪 里 ， 愿 你 所 赐 给 我 的 人 也 同 我 在 哪 里 ， 叫 他 们 看 见 你 所 赐 给 我 的 荣 耀 。 因 为 创 立 世 界 以 前 ， 你 已 经 爱 我 了 。 [kjv] Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. [bbe] Father, it is my desire that these whom you have given to me may be by my side where I am, so that they may see my glory which you have given to me, because you had love for me before the world came into being. 17:25 [hgb] 公 义 的 父 阿 ， 世 人 未 曾 认 识 你 ， 我 却 认 识 你 。 这 些 人 也 知 道 你 差 了 我 来 。 [kjv] O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. [bbe] Father of righteousness, I have knowledge of you, though the world has not; and to these it is clear that you sent me; 17:26 [hgb] 我 已 将 你 的 名 指 示 他 们 ， 还 要 指 示 他 们 ， 使 你 所 爱 我 的 爱 在 他 们 里 面 ， 我 也 在 他 们 里 面 。 [kjv] And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. [bbe] And I have given to them knowledge of your name, and will give it, so that the love which you have for me may be in them and I in them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/157/2180.html","bookId":101,"book":{"id":101,"title":"约翰福音 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 太 初 有 道 ， 道 与 神 同 在 ， 道 就 是 神 。 [kjv] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
