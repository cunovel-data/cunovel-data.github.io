{"id":2529,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"16:1 [hgb] 我 已 将 这 些 事 告 诉 你 们 ， 使 你 们 不 至 于 跌 倒 。 \n [kjv] These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. \n [bbe] I have said these things to you so that you may not be in doubt. \n 16:2 [hgb] 人 要 把 你 们 赶 出 会 堂 。 并 且 时 候 将 到 ， 凡 杀 你 们 的 ， 就 以 为 是 事 奉 神 。 \n [kjv] They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. \n [bbe] They will put you out of the Synagogues: yes, the time is coming when whoever puts you to death will have the belief that he is doing God\u0027s pleasure. \n 16:3 [hgb] 他 们 这 样 行 ， 是 因 未 曾 认 识 父 ， 也 未 曾 认 识 我 。 \n [kjv] And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. \n [bbe] They will do these things to you because they have not had knowledge of the Father or of me. \n 16:4 [hgb] 我 将 这 事 告 诉 你 们 ， 是 叫 你 们 到 了 时 候 ， 可 以 想 起 我 对 你 们 说 过 了 。 我 起 先 没 有 将 这 事 告 诉 你 们 ， 因 为 我 与 你 们 同 在 。 \n [kjv] But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. \n [bbe] I have said these things to you so that when the time comes, what I have said may come to your mind. I did not say them to you at the first, because then I was still with you. \n 16:5 [hgb] 现 今 我 往 差 我 来 的 父 那 里 去 。 你 们 中 间 并 没 有 人 问 我 ， 你 往 哪 里 去 ？ \n [kjv] But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? \n [bbe] But now I am going to him who sent me; and not one of you says to me, Where are you going? \n 16:6 [hgb] 只 因 我 将 这 事 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 就 满 心 忧 愁 。 \n [kjv] But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. \n [bbe] But your hearts are full of sorrow because I have said these things. \n 16:7 [hgb] 然 而 我 将 真 情 告 诉 你 们 。 我 去 是 与 你 们 有 益 的 。 我 若 不 去 ， 保 惠 师 就 不 到 你 们 这 里 来 。 我 若 去 ， 就 差 他 来 。 \n [kjv] Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. \n [bbe] But what I am saying is true: my going is for your good: for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. \n 16:8 [hgb] 他 既 来 了 ， 就 要 叫 世 人 为 罪 ， 为 义 ， 为 审 判 ， 自 己 责 备 自 己 。 \n [kjv] And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: \n [bbe] And he, when he comes, will make the world conscious of sin, and of righteousness, and of being judged: \n 16:9 [hgb] 为 罪 ， 是 因 他 们 不 信 我 。 \n [kjv] Of sin, because they believe not on me; \n [bbe] Of sin, because they have not faith in me; \n 16:10 [hgb] 为 义 ， 是 因 我 往 父 那 里 去 ， 你 们 就 不 再 见 我 。 \n [kjv] Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; \n [bbe] Of righteousness, because I go to the Father and you will see me no more; \n 16:11 [hgb] 为 审 判 ， 是 因 这 世 界 的 王 受 了 审 判 。 \n [kjv] Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. \n [bbe] Of being judged, because the ruler of this world has been judged. \n 16:12 [hgb] 我 还 有 好 些 事 要 告 诉 你 们 ， 但 你 们 现 在 担 当 不 了 （ 或 作 不 能 领 会 ） 。 \n [kjv] I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. \n [bbe] I have still much to say to you, but you are not strong enough for it now. \n 16:13 [hgb] 只 等 真 理 的 圣 灵 来 了 ， 他 要 引 导 你 们 明 白 （ 原 文 作 进 入 ） 一 切 的 真 理 。 因 为 他 不 是 凭 自 己 说 的 ， 乃 是 把 他 所 听 见 的 都 说 出 来 。 并 要 把 将 来 的 事 告 诉 你 们 。 \n [kjv] Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. \n [bbe] However, when he, the Spirit of true knowledge, has come, he will be your guide into all true knowledge: for his words will not come from himself, but whatever has come to his hearing, that he will say: and he will make clear to you the things to come. \n 16:14 [hgb] 他 要 荣 耀 我 。 因 为 他 要 将 受 于 我 的 ， 告 诉 你 们 。 \n [kjv] He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. \n [bbe] He will give me glory, because he will take of what is mine, and make it clear to you. \n 16:15 [hgb] 凡 父 所 有 的 ， 都 是 我 的 ， 所 以 我 说 ， 他 要 将 受 于 我 的 ， 告 诉 你 们 。 \n [kjv] All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. \n [bbe] Everything which the Father has is mine: that is why I say, He will take of what is mine and will make it clear to you. \n 16:16 [hgb] 等 不 多 时 ， 你 们 就 不 得 见 我 。 再 等 不 多 时 ， 你 们 还 要 见 我 。 \n [kjv] A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. \n [bbe] After a little time you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me. \n 16:17 [hgb] 有 几 个 门 徒 就 彼 此 说 ， 他 对 我 们 说 ， 等 不 多 时 ， 你 们 就 不 得 见 我 。 再 等 不 多 时 ， 你 们 还 要 见 我 。 又 说 ， 因 我 往 父 那 里 去 。 这 是 什 么 意 思 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? \n [bbe] So some of the disciples said one to another, What is this he is saying, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me? and, I am going to the Father? \n 16:18 [hgb] 门 徒 彼 此 说 ， 他 说 等 不 多 时 ， 到 底 是 什 么 意 思 呢 ？ 我 们 不 明 白 他 所 说 的 话 。 \n [kjv] They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. \n [bbe] So they said again and again, What is this he is saying, A little time? His words are not clear to us. \n 16:19 [hgb] 耶 稣 看 出 他 们 要 问 他 ， 就 说 ， 我 说 等 不 多 时 ， 你 们 就 不 得 见 我 ， 再 等 不 多 时 ， 你 们 还 要 见 我 。 你 们 为 这 话 彼 此 相 问 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? \n [bbe] Jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him, so he said to them, Is this what you are questioning one with another, why I said, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me? \n 16:20 [hgb] 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 将 要 痛 哭 ， 哀 号 ， 世 人 倒 要 喜 乐 。 你 们 将 要 忧 愁 ， 然 而 你 们 的 忧 愁 ， 要 变 为 喜 乐 。 \n [kjv] Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. \n [bbe] Truly I say to you, You will be weeping and sorrowing, but the world will be glad: you will be sad, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. \n 16:21 [hgb] 妇 人 生 产 的 时 候 ， 就 忧 愁 ， 因 为 她 的 时 候 到 了 。 既 生 了 孩 子 ， 就 不 再 记 念 那 苦 楚 ， 因 为 欢 喜 世 上 生 了 一 个 人 。 \n [kjv] A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. \n [bbe] When a woman is about to give birth she has sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she has given birth to the child, the pain is put out of her mind by the joy that a man has come into the world. \n 16:22 [hgb] 你 们 现 在 也 是 忧 愁 。 但 我 要 再 见 你 们 ， 你 们 的 心 就 喜 乐 了 。 这 喜 乐 ， 也 没 有 人 能 夺 去 。 \n [kjv] And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. \n [bbe] So you have sorrow now: but I will see you again, and your hearts will be glad, and no one will take away your joy. \n 16:23 [hgb] 到 那 日 ， 你 们 什 么 也 就 不 问 我 了 。 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 若 向 父 求 什 么 ， 他 必 因 我 的 名 ， 赐 给 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. \n [bbe] And on that day you will put no questions to me. Truly I say to you, Whatever request you make to the Father, he will give it to you in my name. \n 16:24 [hgb] 向 来 你 们 没 有 奉 我 的 名 求 什 么 ， 如 今 你 们 求 就 必 得 着 ， 叫 你 们 的 喜 乐 可 以 满 足 。 \n [kjv] Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. \n [bbe] Up to now you have made no request in my name: do so, and it will be answered, so that your hearts may be full of joy. \n 16:25 [hgb] 这 些 事 ， 我 是 用 比 喻 对 你 们 说 的 。 时 候 将 到 ， 我 不 再 用 比 喻 对 你 们 说 ， 乃 要 将 父 明 明 地 告 诉 你 们 。 \n [kjv] These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. \n [bbe] All this I have said to you in veiled language: but the time is coming when I will no longer say things in veiled language but will give you knowledge of the Father clearly. \n 16:26 [hgb] 到 那 日 ， 你 们 要 奉 我 的 名 祈 求 。 我 并 不 对 你 们 说 ， 我 要 为 你 们 求 父 。 \n [kjv] At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: \n [bbe] In that day you will make requests in my name: and I do not say that I will make prayer to the Father for you, \n 16:27 [hgb] 父 自 己 爱 你 们 ， 因 为 你 们 已 经 爱 我 ， 又 信 我 是 从 父 出 来 的 。 \n [kjv] For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. \n [bbe] For the Father himself gives his love to you, because you have given your love to me and have had faith that I came from God. \n 16:28 [hgb] 我 从 父 出 来 ， 到 了 世 界 。 我 又 离 开 世 界 ， 往 父 那 里 去 。 \n [kjv] I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. \n [bbe] I came out from the Father and have come into the world: again, I go away from the world and go to the Father. \n 16:29 [hgb] 门 徒 说 ， 如 今 你 是 明 说 ， 并 不 用 比 喻 了 。 \n [kjv] His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. \n [bbe] His disciples said, Now you are talking clearly and not in veiled language. \n 16:30 [hgb] 现 在 我 们 晓 得 你 凡 事 都 知 道 ， 也 不 用 人 问 你 。 因 此 我 们 信 你 是 从 神 出 来 的 。 \n [kjv] Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. \n [bbe] Now we are certain that you have knowledge of all things and have no need for anyone to put questions to you: through this we have faith that you came from God. \n 16:31 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 现 在 你 们 信 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? \n [bbe] Jesus made answer, Have you faith now? \n 16:32 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 时 候 将 到 ， 且 是 已 经 到 了 ， 你 们 要 分 散 ， 各 归 自 己 的 地 方 去 ， 留 下 我 独 自 一 人 。 其 实 我 不 是 独 自 一 人 ， 因 为 有 父 与 我 同 在 。 \n [kjv] Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. \n [bbe] See, a time is coming, yes, it is now here, when you will go away in all directions, every man to his house, and I will be by myself: but I am not by myself, because the Father is with me. \n 16:33 [hgb] 我 将 这 些 事 告 诉 你 们 ， 是 要 叫 你 们 在 我 里 面 有 平 安 。 在 世 上 你 们 有 苦 难 。 但 你 们 可 以 放 心 ， 我 已 经 胜 了 世 界 。 \n [kjv] These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. \n [bbe] I have said all these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble: but take heart! I have overcome the world. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/157/2179.html","bookId":101,"book":{"id":101,"title":"约翰福音 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 太 初 有 道 ， 道 与 神 同 在 ， 道 就 是 神 。 [kjv] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
