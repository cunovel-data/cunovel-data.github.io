{"id":2524,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"11:1 [hgb] 有 一 个 患 病 的 人 ， 名 叫 拉 撒 路 ， 住 在 伯 大 尼 ， 就 是 马 利 亚 和 她 姐 姐 马 大 的 村 庄 。 [kjv] Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. [bbe] Now a certain man named Lazarus was ill; he was of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. 11:2 [hgb] 这 马 利 亚 就 是 那 用 香 膏 抹 主 ， 又 用 头 发 擦 他 脚 的 。 患 病 的 拉 撒 路 是 她 的 兄 弟 。 [kjv] (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) [bbe] (The Mary whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who put perfumed oil on the Lord and made his feet dry with her hair.) 11:3 [hgb] 她 姊 妹 两 个 就 打 发 人 去 见 耶 稣 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 所 爱 的 人 病 了 。 [kjv] Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. [bbe] So the sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, your dear friend is ill. 11:4 [hgb] 耶 稣 听 见 就 说 ， 这 病 不 至 于 死 ， 乃 是 为 神 的 荣 耀 ， 叫 神 的 儿 子 因 此 得 荣 耀 。 [kjv] When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. [bbe] When this came to his ears, Jesus said, The end of this disease is not death, but the glory of God, so that the Son of God may have glory because of it. 11:5 [hgb] 耶 稣 素 来 爱 马 大 ， 和 她 妹 子 ， 并 拉 撒 路 。 [kjv] Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. [bbe] Now Jesus had love in his heart for Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 11:6 [hgb] 听 见 拉 撒 路 病 了 ， 就 在 所 居 之 地 ， 仍 住 了 两 天 。 [kjv] When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. [bbe] So when the news came to him that Lazarus was ill, he did not go from the place where he was for two days. 11:7 [hgb] 然 后 对 门 徒 说 ， 我 们 再 往 犹 太 去 吧 。 [kjv] Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. [bbe] Then after that time he said to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 11:8 [hgb] 门 徒 说 ， 拉 比 ， 犹 太 人 近 来 要 拿 石 头 打 你 ， 你 还 往 那 里 去 吗 ？ [kjv] His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? [bbe] The disciples said to him, Master, the Jews were attempting only the other day to have you stoned, and are you going back there again? 11:9 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 白 日 不 是 有 十 二 小 时 吗 ？ 人 在 白 日 走 路 ， 就 不 至 跌 倒 ， 因 为 看 见 这 世 上 的 光 。 [kjv] Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. [bbe] Then Jesus said in answer, Are there not twelve hours in the day? A man may go about in the day without falling, because he sees the light of this world. 11:10 [hgb] 若 在 黑 夜 走 路 ， 就 必 跌 倒 ， 因 为 他 没 有 光 。 [kjv] But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. [bbe] But if a man goes about in the night, he may have a fall because the light is not in him. 11:11 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 了 这 话 ， 随 后 对 他 们 说 ， 我 们 的 朋 友 拉 撒 路 睡 了 ， 我 去 叫 醒 他 。 [kjv] These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. [bbe] These things said he: and after that he said to them, Lazarus our friend is at rest; but I go so that I may make him come out of his sleep. 11:12 [hgb] 门 徒 说 ， 主 阿 ， 他 若 睡 了 ， 就 必 好 了 。 [kjv] Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. [bbe] Then his disciples said to him, Lord, if he is resting he will get well. 11:13 [hgb] 耶 稣 这 话 是 指 着 他 死 说 的 。 他 们 却 以 为 是 说 照 常 睡 了 。 [kjv] Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. [bbe] Jesus, however, was talking of his death: but they had the idea that he was talking about taking rest in sleep. 11:14 [hgb] 耶 稣 就 明 明 地 告 诉 他 们 说 ， 拉 撒 路 死 了 。 [kjv] Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. [bbe] Then Jesus said to them clearly, Lazarus is dead. 11:15 [hgb] 我 没 有 在 那 里 就 欢 喜 ， 这 是 为 你 们 的 缘 故 ， 好 叫 你 们 相 信 。 如 今 我 们 可 以 往 他 那 里 去 吧 。 [kjv] And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. [bbe] And because of you I am glad I was not there, so that you may have faith; but let us go to him. 11:16 [hgb] 多 马 ， 又 称 为 低 土 马 ， 就 对 那 同 作 门 徒 的 说 ， 我 们 也 去 和 他 同 死 吧 。 [kjv] Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. [bbe] Then Thomas, who was named Didymus, said to the other disciples, Let us go so that we may be with him in death. 11:17 [hgb] 耶 稣 到 了 ， 就 知 道 拉 撒 路 在 坟 墓 里 ， 已 经 四 天 了 。 [kjv] Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. [bbe] Now when Jesus came, he made the discovery that Lazarus had been put into the earth four days before. 11:18 [hgb] 伯 大 尼 离 耶 路 撒 冷 不 远 ， 约 有 六 里 路 。 [kjv] Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: [bbe] Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about two miles away; 11:19 [hgb] 有 好 些 犹 太 人 来 看 马 大 和 马 利 亚 ， 要 为 她 们 的 兄 弟 安 慰 她 们 。 [kjv] And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. [bbe] And a number of Jews had come to Martha and Mary to give them comfort about their brother. 11:20 [hgb] 马 大 听 见 耶 稣 来 了 ， 就 出 去 迎 接 他 。 马 利 亚 却 仍 然 坐 在 家 里 。 [kjv] Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. [bbe] When Martha had the news that Jesus was on the way, she went out to him, but Mary did not go from the house. 11:21 [hgb] 马 大 对 耶 稣 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 若 早 在 这 里 ， 我 兄 弟 必 不 死 。 [kjv] Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. [bbe] Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here my brother would not be dead. 11:22 [hgb] 就 是 现 在 ， 我 也 知 道 ， 你 无 论 向 神 求 什 么 ， 神 也 必 赐 给 你 。 [kjv] But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. [bbe] But I am certain that, even now, whatever request you make to God, God will give it to you. 11:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 兄 弟 必 然 复 活 。 [kjv] Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. [bbe] Jesus said to her, Your brother will come to life again. 11:24 [hgb] 马 大 说 ， 我 知 道 在 末 日 复 活 的 时 候 ， 他 必 复 活 。 [kjv] Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. [bbe] Martha said to him, I am certain that he will come to life again when all come back from the dead at the last day. 11:25 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 复 活 在 我 ， 生 命 也 在 我 。 信 我 的 人 ， 虽 然 死 了 ， 也 必 复 活 。 [kjv] Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: [bbe] Jesus said to her, I am myself that day and that life; he who has faith in me will have life even if he is dead; 11:26 [hgb] 凡 活 着 信 我 的 人 ， 必 永 远 不 死 。 你 信 这 话 吗 ？ [kjv] And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? [bbe] And no one who is living and has faith in me will ever see death. Is this your faith? 11:27 [hgb] 马 大 说 ， 主 阿 ， 是 的 ， 我 信 你 是 基 督 ， 是 神 的 儿 子 ， 就 是 那 要 临 到 世 界 的 。 [kjv] She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. [bbe] She said to him, Yes, Lord: my faith is that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world. 11:28 [hgb] 马 大 说 了 这 话 ， 就 回 去 暗 暗 地 叫 她 妹 子 ， 马 利 亚 说 ， 夫 子 来 了 ， 叫 你 。 [kjv] And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. [bbe] And having said this, she went away and said secretly to her sister Mary, The Master is here and has sent for you. 11:29 [hgb] 马 利 亚 听 见 了 就 急 忙 起 来 ， 到 耶 稣 那 里 去 。 [kjv] As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. [bbe] And Mary, hearing this, got up quickly and went to him. 11:30 [hgb] 那 时 ， 耶 稣 还 没 有 进 村 子 ， 仍 在 马 大 迎 接 他 的 地 方 。 [kjv] Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. [bbe] Now Jesus had not at this time come into the town, but was still in the place where Martha had seen him. 11:31 [hgb] 那 些 同 马 利 亚 在 家 里 安 慰 她 的 犹 太 人 ， 见 她 急 忙 起 来 出 去 ， 就 跟 着 她 ， 以 为 她 要 往 坟 墓 那 里 去 哭 。 [kjv] The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. [bbe] Then the Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, when they saw Mary get up quickly and go out, went after her in the belief that she was going to the place of the dead and would be weeping there. 11:32 [hgb] 马 利 亚 到 了 耶 稣 那 里 ， 看 见 他 ， 就 俯 伏 在 他 脚 前 ， 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 若 早 在 这 里 ， 我 兄 弟 必 不 死 。 [kjv] Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. [bbe] When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she went down at his feet, saying, Lord, if you had been here my brother would not be dead. 11:33 [hgb] 耶 稣 看 见 她 哭 ， 并 看 见 与 她 同 来 的 犹 太 人 也 哭 ， 就 心 里 悲 叹 ， 又 甚 忧 愁 。 [kjv] When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, [bbe] And when Jesus saw her weeping, and saw the Jews weeping who came with her, his spirit was moved and he was troubled, 11:34 [hgb] 便 说 ， 你 们 把 他 安 放 在 哪 里 ？ 他 们 回 答 说 ， 请 主 来 看 。 [kjv] And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. [bbe] And said, Where have you put him? They said, Come and see, Lord. 11:35 [hgb] 耶 稣 哭 了 。 [kjv] Jesus wept. [bbe] And Jesus himself was weeping. 11:36 [hgb] 犹 太 人 就 说 ， 你 看 他 爱 这 人 是 何 等 恳 切 。 [kjv] Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! [bbe] So the Jews said, See how dear he was to him! 11:37 [hgb] 其 中 有 人 说 ， 他 既 然 开 了 瞎 子 的 眼 睛 ， 岂 不 能 叫 这 人 不 死 吗 ？ [kjv] And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? [bbe] But some of them said, This man, who made open the eyes of the blind man, was he not able to keep his friend from death? 11:38 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 心 里 悲 叹 ， 来 到 坟 墓 前 。 那 坟 墓 是 个 洞 ， 有 一 块 石 头 挡 着 。 [kjv] Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. [bbe] So Jesus, deeply troubled in heart, came to the place of the dead. It was a hole in the rock, and a stone was over the opening. 11:39 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 把 石 头 挪 开 。 那 死 人 的 姐 姐 马 大 对 他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 他 现 在 必 是 臭 了 ， 因 为 他 死 了 已 经 四 天 了 。 [kjv] Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. [bbe] Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said, Lord, by this time the body will be smelling, for he has been dead four days. 11:40 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 我 不 是 对 你 说 过 ， 你 若 信 ， 就 必 看 见 神 的 荣 耀 吗 ？ [kjv] Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? [bbe] Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you that if you had faith you would see the glory of God? 11:41 [hgb] 他 们 就 把 石 头 挪 开 。 耶 稣 举 目 望 天 说 ， 父 阿 ， 我 感 谢 你 ， 因 为 你 已 经 听 我 。 [kjv] Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. [bbe] So they took away the stone. And Jesus, looking up to heaven, said, Father, I give praise to you for hearing me. 11:42 [hgb] 我 也 知 道 你 常 听 我 ， 但 我 说 这 话 ， 是 为 周 围 站 着 的 众 人 ， 叫 他 们 信 是 你 差 了 我 来 。 [kjv] And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. [bbe] I was certain that your ears are at all times open to me, but I said it because of these who are here, so that they may see that you sent me. 11:43 [hgb] 说 了 这 话 ， 就 大 声 呼 叫 说 ， 拉 撒 路 出 来 。 [kjv] And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. [bbe] Then he said in a loud voice, Lazarus, come out! 11:44 [hgb] 那 死 人 就 出 来 了 ， 手 脚 裹 着 布 ， 脸 上 包 着 手 巾 。 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 解 开 ， 叫 他 走 。 [kjv] And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. [bbe] And he who was dead came out, with linen bands folded tightly about his hands and feet, and a cloth about his face. Jesus said to them, Make him free and let him go. 11:45 [hgb] 那 些 来 看 马 利 亚 的 犹 太 人 ， 见 了 耶 稣 所 作 的 事 ， 就 多 有 信 他 的 。 [kjv] Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. [bbe] Then a number of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did had belief in him. 11:46 [hgb] 但 其 中 也 有 去 见 法 利 赛 人 的 ， 将 耶 稣 所 作 的 事 告 诉 他 们 。 [kjv] But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. [bbe] But some of them went to the Pharisees with the news of what Jesus had done. 11:47 [hgb] 祭 司 长 和 法 利 赛 人 聚 集 公 会 ， 说 ， 这 人 行 好 些 神 迹 ， 我 们 怎 么 办 呢 ？ [kjv] Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. [bbe] Then the high priests and the Pharisees had a meeting and said, What are we doing? This man is doing a number of signs. 11:48 [hgb] 若 这 样 由 着 他 ， 人 人 都 要 信 他 。 罗 马 人 也 要 来 夺 我 们 的 地 土 ， 和 我 们 的 百 姓 。 [kjv] If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. [bbe] If we let him go on in this way, everybody will have belief in him and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation. 11:49 [hgb] 内 中 有 一 个 人 ， 名 叫 该 亚 法 ， 本 年 作 大 祭 司 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 不 知 道 什 么 。 [kjv] And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, [bbe] But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You have no knowledge of anything; 11:50 [hgb] 独 不 想 一 个 人 替 百 姓 死 ， 免 得 通 国 灭 亡 ， 就 是 你 们 的 益 处 。 [kjv] Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. [bbe] You do not see that it is in your interest for one man to be put to death for the people, so that all the nation may not come to destruction. 11:51 [hgb] 他 这 话 不 是 出 于 自 己 ， 是 因 他 本 年 作 大 祭 司 ， 所 以 预 言 耶 稣 将 要 替 这 一 国 死 。 [kjv] And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; [bbe] He did not say this of himself, but being the high priest that year he said, as a prophet, that Jesus would be put to death for the nation; 11:52 [hgb] 也 不 但 替 这 一 国 死 ， 并 要 将 神 四 散 的 子 民 ， 都 聚 集 归 一 。 [kjv] And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. [bbe] And not for that nation only, but for the purpose of uniting in one body the children of God all over the world. 11:53 [hgb] 从 那 日 起 ， 他 们 就 商 议 要 杀 耶 稣 。 [kjv] Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. [bbe] And from that day they took thought together how to put him to death. 11:54 [hgb] 所 以 耶 稣 不 再 显 然 行 在 犹 太 人 中 间 ， 就 离 开 那 里 往 靠 近 旷 野 的 地 方 去 。 到 了 一 座 城 ， 名 叫 以 法 莲 ， 就 在 那 里 和 门 徒 同 住 。 [kjv] Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. [bbe] So Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near to the waste land, to a town named Ephraim, where he was for some time with the disciples. 11:55 [hgb] 犹 太 人 的 逾 越 节 近 了 。 有 许 多 人 从 乡 下 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 要 在 节 前 洁 净 自 己 。 [kjv] And the Jews\u0027 passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. [bbe] Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and numbers of people went up from the country to Jerusalem to make themselves clean before the Passover. 11:56 [hgb] 他 们 就 寻 找 耶 稣 ， 站 在 殿 里 彼 此 说 ， 你 们 的 意 思 如 何 ， 他 不 来 过 节 吗 ？ [kjv] Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? [bbe] They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another while they were in the Temple, What is your opinion? Will he not come to the feast? 11:57 [hgb] 那 时 ， 祭 司 长 和 法 利 赛 人 早 已 吩 咐 说 ， 若 有 人 知 道 耶 稣 在 哪 里 ， 就 要 报 明 ， 好 去 拿 他 。 [kjv] Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him. [bbe] Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone had knowledge where he was, he was to give them word, so that they might take him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/157/2174.html","bookId":101,"book":{"id":101,"title":"约翰福音 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 太 初 有 道 ， 道 与 神 同 在 ， 道 就 是 神 。 [kjv] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
