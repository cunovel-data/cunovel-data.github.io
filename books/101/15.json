As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. \n [bbe] Be in me at all times as I am in you. As the branch is not able to give fruit of itself, if it is not still on the vine, so you are not able to do so if you are not in me. \n 15:5 [hgb] 我 是 葡 萄 树 ， 你 们 是 枝 子 。 常 在 我 里 面 的 ， 我 也 常 在 他 里 面 ， 这 人 就 多 结 果 子 。 因 为 离 了 我 ， 你 们 就 不 能 作 什 么 。 \n [kjv] I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. \n [bbe] I am the vine, you are the branches: he who is in me at all times as I am in him, gives much fruit, because without me you are able to do nothing. \n 15:6 [hgb] 人 若 不 常 在 我 里 面 ， 就 像 枝 子 丢 在 外 面 枯 干 ， 人 拾 起 来 ， 扔 在 火 里 烧 了 。 \n [kjv] If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. \n [bbe] If a man does not keep himself in me, he becomes dead and is cut off like a dry branch; such branches are taken up and put in the fire and burned. \n 15:7 [hgb] 你 们 若 常 在 我 里 面 ， 我 的 话 也 常 在 你 们 里 面 ， 凡 你 们 所 愿 意 的 ， 祈 求 就 给 你 们 成 就 。 \n [kjv] If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. \n [bbe] If you are in me at all times, and my words are in you, then anything for which you make a request will be done for you. \n 15:8 [hgb] 你 们 多 结 果 子 ， 我 父 就 因 此 得 荣 耀 ， 你 们 也 就 是 我 的 门 徒 了 。 \n [kjv] Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. \n [bbe] Here is my Father\u0027s glory, in that you give much fruit and so are my true disciples. \n 15:9 [hgb] 我 爱 你 们 ， 正 如 父 爱 我 一 样 。 你 们 要 常 在 我 的 爱 里 。 \n [kjv] As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. \n [bbe] Even as the Father has given me his love, so I have given my love to you: be ever in my love. \n 15:10 [hgb] 你 们 若 遵 守 我 的 命 令 ， 就 常 在 我 的 爱 里 。 正 如 我 遵 守 了 我 父 的 命 令 ， 常 在 他 的 爱 里 。 \n [kjv] If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father\u0027s commandments, and abide in his love. \n [bbe] If you keep my laws, you will be ever in my love, even as I have kept my Father\u0027s laws, and am ever in his love. \n 15:11 [hgb] 这 些 事 我 已 经 对 你 们 说 了 ， 是 要 叫 我 的 喜 乐 ， 存 在 你 们 心 里 ， 并 叫 你 们 的 喜 乐 可 以 满 足 。 \n [kjv] These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. \n [bbe] I have said these things to you so that I may have joy in you and so that your joy may be complete. \n 15:12 [hgb] 你 们 要 彼 此 相 爱 ， 像 我 爱 你 们 一 样 ， 这 就 是 我 的 命 令 。 \n [kjv] This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. \n [bbe] This is the law I give you: Have love one for another, even as I have love for you. \n 15:13 [hgb] 人 为 朋 友 舍 命 ， 人 的 爱 心 没 有 比 这 个 大 的 。 \n [kjv] Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. \n [bbe] Greater love has no man than this, that a man gives up his life for his friends. \n 15:14 [hgb] 你 们 若 遵 行 我 所 吩 咐 的 ， 就 是 我 的 朋 友 了 。 \n [kjv] Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. \n [bbe] You are my friends, if you do what I give you orders to do. \n 15:15 [hgb] 以 后 我 不 再 称 你 们 为 仆 人 。 因 仆 人 不 知 道 主 人 所 作 的 事 。 我 乃 称 你 们 为 朋 友 。 因 我 从 我 父 所 听 见 的 。 已 经 都 告 诉 你 们 了 。 \n [kjv] Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. \n [bbe] No longer do I give you the name of servants; because a servant is without knowledge of what his master is doing: I give you the name of friends, because I have given you knowledge of all the things which my Father has said to me. \n 15:16 [hgb] 不 是 你 们 拣 选 了 我 ， 是 我 拣 选 了 你 们 ， 并 且 分 派 你 们 去 结 果 子 ， 叫 你 们 的 果 子 常 存 。 使 你 们 奉 我 的 名 ， 无 论 向 父 求 什 么 ， 他 就 赐 给 你 们 。 \n [kjv] Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. \n [bbe] You did not take me for yourselves, but I took you for myself; and I gave you the work of going about and producing fruit which will be for ever; so that whatever request you make to the Father in my name he may give it to you. \n 15:17 [hgb] 我 这 样 吩 咐 你 们 ， 是 要 叫 你 们 彼 此 相 爱 。 \n [kjv] These things I command you, that ye love one another. \n [bbe] So this is my law for you: Have love one for another. \n 15:18 [hgb] 世 人 若 恨 你 们 ， 你 们 知 道 （ 或 作 该 知 道 ） 恨 你 们 以 先 ， 已 经 恨 我 了 。 \n [kjv] If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. \n [bbe] If you are hated by the world, keep in mind that I was hated by the world before you. \n 15:19 [hgb] 你 们 若 属 世 界 ， 世 界 必 爱 属 自 己 的 。 只 因 你 们 不 属 世 界 。 乃 是 我 从 世 界 中 拣 选 了 你 们 ， 所 以 世 界 就 恨 你 们 。 \n [kjv] If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. \n [bbe] If you were of the world, you would be loved by the world: but because you are not of the world, but I have taken you out of the world, you are hated by the world. \n 15:20 [hgb] 你 们 要 记 念 我 从 前 对 你 们 所 说 的 话 ， 仆 人 不 能 大 于 主 人 。 他 们 若 逼 迫 了 我 ， 也 要 逼 迫 你 们 。 若 遵 守 了 我 的 话 ， 也 要 遵 守 你 们 的 话 。 \n [kjv] Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. \n [bbe] Keep in mind the words I said to you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they were cruel to me, they will be cruel to you; if they kept my words, they will keep yours. \n 15:21 [hgb] 但 他 们 因 我 的 名 ， 要 向 你 们 行 这 一 切 的 事 ， 因 为 他 们 不 认 识 那 差 我 来 的 。 \n [kjv] But all these things will they do unto you for my name\u0027s sake, because they know not him that sent me. \n [bbe] They will do all this to you because of my name--because they have no knowledge of him who sent me. \n 15:22 [hgb] 我 若 没 有 来 教 训 他 们 ， 他 们 就 没 有 罪 。 但 如 今 他 们 的 罪 无 可 推 诿 了 。 \n [kjv] If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. \n [bbe] If I had not come and been their teacher they would have had no sin: but now they have no reason to give for their sin. \n 15:23 [hgb] 恨 我 的 ， 也 恨 我 的 父 。 \n [kjv] He that hateth me hateth my Father also. \n [bbe] He who has hate for me has hate for my Father. \n 15:24 [hgb] 我 若 没 有 在 他 们 中 间 行 过 别 人 未 曾 行 的 事 ， 他 们 就 没 有 罪 。 但 如 今 连 我 与 我 的 父 ， 他 们 也 看 见 也 恨 恶 了 。 \n [kjv] If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. \n [bbe] If I had not done among them the works which no other man ever did, they would have had no sin: but now they have seen, and they have had hate in their hearts for me and my Father. \n 15:25 [hgb] 这 要 应 验 他 们 律 法 上 所 写 的 话 说 ， 他 们 无 故 恨 我 。 \n [kjv] But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. \n [bbe] This comes about so that the writing in their law may be made true, Their hate for me was without cause. \n 15:26 [hgb] 但 我 要 从 父 那 里 差 保 惠 师 来 ， 就 是 从 父 出 来 真 理 的 圣 灵 。 他 来 了 ， 就 要 为 我 作 见 证 。 \n [kjv] But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: \n [bbe] When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father even the Spirit of true knowledge who comes from the Father--he will give witness about me; \n 15:27 [hgb] 你 们 也 要 作 见 证 ， 因 为 你 们 从 起 头 就 与 我 同 在 。 \n [kjv] And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning. \n [bbe] And you, in addition, will give witness because you have been with me from the first. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/157/2178.html","bookId":101,"book":{"id":101,"title":"约翰福音 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 太 初 有 道 ， 道 与 神 同 在 ， 道 就 是 神 。 [kjv] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
