{"id":2533,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"20:1 [hgb] 七 日 的 第 一 日 清 早 ， 天 还 黑 的 时 候 ， 抹 大 拉 的 马 利 亚 来 到 坟 墓 那 里 ， 看 见 石 头 从 坟 墓 挪 开 了 。 [kjv] The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. [bbe] Now on the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken away from it. 20:2 [hgb] 就 跑 来 见 西 门 彼 得 ， 和 耶 稣 所 爱 的 那 个 门 徒 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 有 人 把 主 从 坟 墓 里 挪 了 去 ， 我 们 不 知 道 放 在 哪 里 。 [kjv] Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. [bbe] Then she went running to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple who was loved by Jesus, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the place of the dead and we have no knowledge where they have put him. 20:3 [hgb] 彼 得 和 那 门 徒 就 出 来 ， 往 坟 墓 那 里 去 。 [kjv] Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. [bbe] So Peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead. 20:4 [hgb] 两 个 人 同 跑 ， 那 门 徒 比 彼 得 跑 得 更 快 ， 先 到 了 坟 墓 。 [kjv] So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. [bbe] They went running together, and the other disciple got in front of Peter and came first to the hole in the rock; 20:5 [hgb] 低 头 往 里 看 ， 就 见 细 麻 布 还 放 在 那 里 。 只 是 没 有 进 去 。 [kjv] And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. [bbe] And looking in, he saw the linen bands on the earth; but he did not go in, 20:6 [hgb] 西 门 彼 得 随 后 也 到 了 ， 进 坟 墓 里 去 ， 就 看 见 细 麻 布 还 放 在 那 里 。 [kjv] Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, [bbe] Then Simon Peter came after him and went into the hole in the rock; and he saw the linen bands on the earth, 20:7 [hgb] 又 看 见 耶 稣 的 裹 头 巾 ， 没 有 和 细 麻 布 放 在 一 处 ， 是 另 在 一 处 卷 着 。 [kjv] And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. [bbe] And the cloth, which had been round his head, not with the linen bands but rolled up in a place by itself. 20:8 [hgb] 先 到 坟 墓 的 那 门 徒 也 进 去 ， 看 见 就 信 了 。 [kjv] Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. [bbe] Then the other disciple who came there first went in; and he saw and belief came to him. 20:9 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 还 不 明 白 圣 经 的 意 思 ， 就 是 耶 稣 必 要 从 死 里 复 活 。 [kjv] For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. [bbe] For at that time they had no knowledge that the Writings said that he would have to come again from the dead. 20:10 [hgb] 于 是 两 个 门 徒 回 自 己 的 住 处 去 了 。 [kjv] Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. [bbe] So then the disciples went away again to their houses. 20:11 [hgb] 马 利 亚 却 站 在 坟 墓 外 面 哭 。 哭 的 时 候 ， 低 头 往 坟 墓 里 看 ， [kjv] But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, [bbe] But Mary was still there outside the hole in the rock, weeping; and while she was weeping and looking into the hole, 20:12 [hgb] 就 见 两 个 天 使 ， 穿 着 白 衣 ， 在 安 放 耶 稣 身 体 的 地 方 坐 着 ， 一 个 在 头 ， 一 个 在 脚 。 [kjv] And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. [bbe] She saw two angels in white seated where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head and the other at the feet. 20:13 [hgb] 天 使 对 她 说 ， 妇 人 ， 你 为 什 么 哭 ？ 她 说 ， 因 为 有 人 把 我 主 挪 了 去 ， 我 不 知 道 放 在 哪 里 。 [kjv] And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him. [bbe] They said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I have no knowledge where they have put him. 20:14 [hgb] 说 了 这 话 ， 就 转 过 身 来 ， 看 见 耶 稣 站 在 那 里 ， 却 不 知 道 是 耶 稣 。 [kjv] And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. [bbe] And then looking round, she saw Jesus there, but had no idea that it was Jesus. 20:15 [hgb] 耶 稣 问 她 说 ， 妇 人 ， 为 什 么 哭 ？ 你 找 谁 呢 ？ 马 利 亚 以 为 是 看 园 的 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 先 生 ， 若 是 你 把 他 移 了 去 ， 请 告 诉 我 ， 你 把 他 放 在 哪 里 ， 我 便 去 取 他 。 [kjv] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. [bbe] Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? who are you looking for? She, taking him for the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have taken him away from here, say where you have put him and I will take him away. 20:16 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 马 利 亚 。 马 利 亚 就 转 过 来 ， 用 希 伯 来 话 对 他 说 ， 拉 波 尼 。 （ 拉 波 尼 就 是 夫 子 的 意 思 ） [kjv] Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. [bbe] Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning, she said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master). 20:17 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 不 要 摸 我 。 因 我 还 没 有 升 上 去 见 我 的 父 。 你 往 我 弟 兄 那 里 去 ， 告 诉 他 们 说 ， 我 要 升 上 去 ， 见 我 的 父 ， 也 是 你 们 的 父 。 见 我 的 神 ， 也 是 你 们 的 神 。 [kjv] Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. [bbe] Jesus said to her, Do not put your hand on me, for I have not gone up to the Father: but go to my brothers and say to them, I go up to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God. 20:18 [hgb] 抹 大 拉 的 马 利 亚 就 去 告 诉 门 徒 说 ， 我 已 经 看 见 了 主 。 她 又 将 主 对 她 说 的 这 话 告 诉 他 们 。 [kjv] Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her. [bbe] Mary Magdalene went with the news to the disciples, and said she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her. 20:19 [hgb] 那 日 ， （ 就 是 七 日 的 第 一 日 ） 晚 上 ， 门 徒 所 在 的 地 方 ， 因 怕 犹 太 人 ， 门 都 关 了 。 耶 稣 来 站 在 当 中 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 愿 你 们 平 安 。 [kjv] Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. [bbe] At evening on that day, the first day of the week, when, for fear of the Jews, the doors were shut where the disciples were, Jesus came among them and said to them, May peace be with you! 20:20 [hgb] 说 了 这 话 ， 就 把 手 和 肋 旁 ， 指 给 他 们 看 。 门 徒 看 见 主 ， 就 喜 乐 了 。 [kjv] And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD. [bbe] And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. 20:21 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 对 他 们 说 ， 愿 你 们 平 安 。 父 怎 样 差 遣 了 我 ， 我 也 照 样 差 遣 你 们 。 [kjv] Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. [bbe] And Jesus said to them again, May peace be with you! As the Father sent me, even so I now send you. 20:22 [hgb] 说 了 这 话 ， 就 向 他 们 吹 一 口 气 ， 说 ， 你 们 受 圣 灵 。 [kjv] And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: [bbe] And when he had said this, breathing on them, he said to them, Let the Holy Spirit come on you: 20:23 [hgb] 你 们 赦 免 谁 的 罪 ， 谁 的 罪 就 赦 免 了 。 你 们 留 下 谁 的 罪 ， 谁 的 罪 就 留 下 了 。 [kjv] Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. [bbe] Any to whom you give forgiveness, will be made free from their sins; and any from whom you keep back forgiveness, will still be in their sins. 20:24 [hgb] 那 十 二 个 门 徒 中 ， 有 称 为 低 土 马 的 多 马 。 耶 稣 来 的 时 候 ， 他 没 有 和 他 们 同 在 。 [kjv] But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. [bbe] Now Thomas, one of the twelve, named Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 20:25 [hgb] 那 些 门 徒 就 对 他 说 ， 我 们 已 经 看 见 主 了 。 多 马 却 说 ， 我 非 看 见 他 手 上 的 钉 痕 ， 用 指 头 探 入 那 钉 痕 ， 又 用 手 探 入 他 的 肋 旁 ， 我 总 不 信 。 [kjv] The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. [bbe] So the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, If I do not see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails, and if I do not put my hand into his side, I will never have belief. 20:26 [hgb] 过 了 八 日 ， 门 徒 又 在 屋 里 ， 多 马 也 和 他 们 同 在 ， 门 都 关 了 。 耶 稣 来 站 在 当 中 说 ， 愿 你 们 平 安 。 [kjv] And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. [bbe] And after eight days, his disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were shut, Jesus came, and taking his place in the middle of them, he said, May peace be with you! 20:27 [hgb] 就 对 多 马 说 ， 伸 过 你 的 指 头 来 ， 摸 （ 摸 原 文 作 看 ） 我 的 手 。 伸 出 你 的 手 来 ， 探 入 我 的 肋 旁 。 不 要 疑 惑 ， 总 要 信 。 [kjv] Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. [bbe] Then he said to Thomas, Put out your finger, and see my hands; and put your hand here into my side: and be no longer in doubt but have belief. 20:28 [hgb] 多 马 说 ， 我 的 主 ， 我 的 神 。 [kjv] And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God. [bbe] And Thomas said in answer, My Lord and my God! 20:29 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 你 因 看 见 了 我 才 信 。 那 没 有 看 见 就 信 的 ， 有 福 了 。 [kjv] Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. [bbe] Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me you have belief: a blessing will be on those who have belief though they have not seen me! 20:30 [hgb] 耶 稣 在 门 徒 面 前 ， 另 外 行 了 许 多 神 迹 ， 没 有 记 在 这 书 上 。 [kjv] And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: [bbe] A number of other signs Jesus did before his disciples which are not recorded in this book: 20:31 [hgb] 但 记 这 些 事 ， 要 叫 你 们 信 耶 稣 是 基 督 ， 是 神 的 儿 子 。 并 且 叫 你 们 信 了 他 ， 就 可 以 因 他 的 名 得 生 命 。 [kjv] But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. [bbe] But these are recorded, so that you may have faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that, having this faith you may have life in his name.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/157/2183.html","bookId":101,"book":{"id":101,"title":"约翰福音 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 太 初 有 道 ， 道 与 神 同 在 ， 道 就 是 神 。 [kjv] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
