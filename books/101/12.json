Let her keep what she has for the day of my death. \n 12:8 [hgb] 因 为 常 有 穷 人 和 你 们 同 在 。 只 是 你 们 不 常 有 我 。 \n [kjv] For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. \n [bbe] The poor you have ever with you, but me you have not for ever. \n 12:9 [hgb] 有 许 多 犹 太 人 知 道 耶 稣 在 那 里 ， 就 来 了 ， 不 但 是 为 耶 稣 的 缘 故 ， 也 是 要 看 他 从 死 里 所 复 活 的 拉 撒 路 。 \n [kjv] Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus\u0027 sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. \n [bbe] Then a great number of the Jews had news that he was there: and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they might see Lazarus who had been dead and to whom he had given life. \n 12:10 [hgb] 但 祭 司 长 商 议 连 拉 撒 路 也 要 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; \n [bbe] Now there was talk among the chief priests of putting Lazarus to death; \n 12:11 [hgb] 因 有 好 些 犹 太 人 ， 为 拉 撒 路 的 缘 故 ， 回 去 信 了 耶 稣 。 \n [kjv] Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. \n [bbe] For because of him a great number of the Jews went away and had belief in Jesus. \n 12:12 [hgb] 第 二 天 ， 有 许 多 上 来 过 节 的 人 ， 听 见 耶 稣 将 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， \n [kjv] On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, \n [bbe] The day after, a great number of people who were there for the feast, when they had the news that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, \n 12:13 [hgb] 就 拿 着 棕 树 枝 ， 出 去 迎 接 他 ， 喊 着 说 ， 和 散 那 ， 奉 主 名 来 的 以 色 列 王 ， 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 \n [kjv] Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. \n [bbe] Took branches of palm-trees and went out to him, crying, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel! \n 12:14 [hgb] 耶 稣 得 了 一 个 驴 驹 ， 就 骑 上 。 如 经 上 所 记 的 说 ， \n [kjv] And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, \n [bbe] And Jesus saw a young ass and took his seat on it; as the Writings say, \n 12:15 [hgb] 锡 安 的 民 哪 ， （ 民 原 文 作 女 子 ） 不 要 惧 怕 ， 你 的 王 骑 着 驴 驹 来 了 。 \n [kjv] Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass\u0027s colt. \n [bbe] Have no fear, daughter of Zion: see your King is coming, seated on a young ass. \n 12:16 [hgb] 这 些 事 门 徒 起 先 不 明 白 。 等 到 耶 稣 得 了 荣 耀 以 后 ， 才 想 起 这 话 是 指 着 他 写 的 ， 并 且 众 人 果 然 向 他 这 样 行 了 。 \n [kjv] These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. \n [bbe] (These things were not clear to his disciples at first: but when Jesus had been lifted up into his glory, then it came to their minds that these things in the Writings were about him and that they had been done to him.) \n 12:17 [hgb] 当 耶 稣 呼 唤 拉 撒 路 叫 他 从 死 复 活 出 坟 墓 的 时 候 ， 同 耶 稣 在 那 里 的 众 人 ， 就 作 见 证 。 \n [kjv] The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. \n [bbe] Now the people who were with him when his voice came to Lazarus in the place of the dead, and gave him life again, had been talking about it. \n 12:18 [hgb] 众 人 因 听 见 耶 稣 行 了 这 神 迹 ， 就 去 迎 接 他 。 \n [kjv] For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. \n [bbe] And that was the reason the people went out to him, because it had come to their ears that he had done this sign. \n 12:19 [hgb] 法 利 赛 人 彼 此 说 ， 看 哪 ， 你 们 是 徒 劳 无 益 ， 世 人 都 随 从 他 去 了 。 \n [kjv] The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. \n [bbe] Then the Pharisees said one to another, You see, you are unable to do anything: the world has gone after him. \n 12:20 [hgb] 那 时 ， 上 来 过 节 礼 拜 的 人 中 ， 有 几 个 希 利 尼 人 。 \n [kjv] And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: \n [bbe] Now there were some Greeks among the people who had come up to give worship at the feast: \n 12:21 [hgb] 他 们 来 见 加 利 利 伯 赛 大 的 腓 力 ， 求 他 说 ， 先 生 ， 我 们 愿 意 见 耶 稣 。 \n [kjv] The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. \n [bbe] They came to Philip, who was of Beth-saida in Galilee, and made a request, saying, Sir, we have a desire to see Jesus. \n 12:22 [hgb] 腓 力 去 告 诉 安 得 烈 ， 安 得 烈 同 腓 力 去 告 诉 耶 稣 。 \n [kjv] Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. \n [bbe] Philip went and gave word of it to Andrew; and Andrew went with Philip to Jesus. \n 12:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 人 子 得 荣 耀 的 时 候 到 了 。 \n [kjv] And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. \n [bbe] And Jesus said to them in answer, The hour of the glory of the Son of man has come. \n 12:24 [hgb] 我 实 实 在 在 地 告 诉 你 们 ， 一 粒 麦 子 不 落 在 地 里 死 了 ， 仍 旧 是 一 粒 。 若 是 死 了 ， 就 结 出 许 多 子 粒 来 。 \n [kjv] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. \n [bbe] Truly I say to you, If a seed of grain does not go into the earth and come to an end, it is still a seed and no more; but through its death it gives much fruit. \n 12:25 [hgb] 爱 惜 自 己 生 命 的 ， 就 失 丧 生 命 。 在 这 世 上 恨 恶 自 己 生 命 的 ， 就 要 保 守 生 命 到 永 生 。 \n [kjv] He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. \n [bbe] He who is in love with life will have it taken from him; and he who has no care for his life in this world will keep it for ever and ever. \n 12:26 [hgb] 若 有 人 服 事 我 ， 就 当 跟 从 我 。 我 在 哪 里 ， 服 事 我 的 人 ， 也 要 在 哪 里 。 若 有 人 服 事 我 ， 我 父 必 尊 重 他 。 \n [kjv] If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. \n [bbe] If any man is my servant, let him come after me; and where I am, there will my servant be. If any man becomes my servant, my Father will give him honour. \n 12:27 [hgb] 我 现 在 心 里 忧 愁 ， 我 说 什 么 才 好 呢 ？ 父 阿 ， 救 我 脱 离 这 时 候 。 但 我 原 是 为 这 时 候 来 的 。 \n [kjv] Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. \n [bbe] Now is my soul troubled; and what am I to say? Father, keep me from this hour. No: for this purpose have I come to this hour. \n 12:28 [hgb] 父 阿 ， 愿 你 荣 耀 你 的 名 。 当 时 就 有 声 音 从 天 上 来 说 ， 我 已 经 荣 耀 了 我 的 名 ， 还 要 再 荣 耀 。 \n [kjv] Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. \n [bbe] Father, give glory to your name. Then there came a voice out of heaven, saying, I have given it glory, and I will give it glory again. \n 12:29 [hgb] 站 在 旁 边 的 众 人 听 见 ， 就 说 ， 打 雷 了 。 还 有 人 说 ， 有 天 使 对 他 说 话 。 \n [kjv] The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. \n [bbe] Hearing the sound, a number of people who were there said that it was thunder: others said, An angel was talking to him. \n 12:30 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 这 声 音 不 是 为 我 ， 是 为 你 们 来 的 。 \n [kjv] Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. \n [bbe] Jesus said in answer, This voice came not for me but for you. \n 12:31 [hgb] 现 在 这 世 界 受 审 判 。 这 世 界 的 王 要 被 赶 出 去 。 \n [kjv] Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. \n [bbe] Now is this world to be judged: now will the ruler of this world be sent out. \n 12:32 [hgb] 我 若 从 地 上 被 举 起 来 ， 就 要 吸 引 万 人 来 归 我 。 \n [kjv] And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. \n [bbe] And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will make all men come to me. \n 12:33 [hgb] 耶 稣 这 话 原 是 指 着 自 己 将 要 怎 样 死 说 的 。 \n [kjv] This he said, signifying what death he should die. \n [bbe] (This he said, pointing to the sort of death he would have.) \n 12:34 [hgb] 众 人 回 答 说 ， 我 们 听 见 律 法 上 有 话 说 ， 基 督 是 永 存 的 。 你 怎 么 说 ， 人 子 必 须 被 举 起 来 呢 ？ 这 人 子 是 谁 呢 ？ \n [kjv] The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? \n [bbe] Then the people in answer said to him, The law says that the Christ will have life without end: how say you then that it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of man? \n 12:35 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 光 在 你 们 中 间 ， 还 有 不 多 的 时 候 ， 应 当 趁 着 有 光 行 走 ， 免 得 黑 暗 临 到 你 们 。 那 在 黑 暗 里 行 走 的 ， 不 知 道 往 何 处 去 。 \n [kjv] Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. \n [bbe] Jesus said to them, For a little time longer the light will be among you; while you have the light go on walking in it, so that the dark may not overtake you: one walking in the dark has no knowledge of where he is going. \n 12:36 [hgb] 你 们 应 当 趁 着 有 光 ， 信 从 这 光 ， 使 你 们 成 为 光 明 之 子 。 耶 稣 说 了 这 话 ， 就 离 开 他 们 ， 隐 藏 了 。 \n [kjv] While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. \n [bbe] In so far as you have the light, put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light. With these words Jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them. \n 12:37 [hgb] 他 虽 然 在 他 们 面 前 行 了 许 多 神 迹 ， 他 们 还 是 不 信 他 。 \n [kjv] But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: \n [bbe] But though he had done such a number of signs before them, they still had no belief in him: \n 12:38 [hgb] 这 是 要 应 验 先 知 以 赛 亚 的 话 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 们 所 传 的 ， 有 谁 信 呢 ？ 主 的 膀 臂 向 谁 显 露 呢 ？ \n [kjv] That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? \n [bbe] So that the words of the prophet Isaiah might come true, when he said, Lord, who has any belief in our preaching? and the arm of the Lord, to whom has it been unveiled? \n 12:39 [hgb] 他 们 所 以 不 能 信 ， 因 为 以 赛 亚 又 说 ， \n [kjv] Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, \n [bbe] For this reason they were unable to have belief, because Isaiah said again, \n 12:40 [hgb] 主 叫 他 们 瞎 了 眼 ， 硬 了 心 ， 免 得 他 们 眼 睛 看 见 ， 心 里 明 白 ， 回 转 过 来 ， 我 就 医 治 他 们 。 \n [kjv] He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. \n [bbe] He has made their eyes blind, and their hearts hard; for fear that they might see with their eyes and get knowledge with their hearts, and be changed, and I might make them well. \n 12:41 [hgb] 以 赛 亚 因 为 看 见 他 的 荣 耀 ， 就 指 着 他 说 这 话 。 \n [kjv] These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. \n [bbe] (Isaiah said these words because he saw his glory. His words were about him.) \n 12:42 [hgb] 虽 然 如 此 ， 官 长 中 却 有 好 些 信 他 的 。 只 因 法 利 赛 人 的 缘 故 ， 就 不 承 认 ， 恐 怕 被 赶 出 会 堂 。 \n [kjv] Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: \n [bbe] However, a number even of the rulers had belief in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not say so openly for fear that they might be shut out from the Synagogue: \n 12:43 [hgb] 这 是 因 他 们 爱 人 的 荣 耀 ， 过 于 爱 神 的 荣 耀 。 \n [kjv] For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. \n [bbe] For the praise of men was dearer to them than the approval of God. \n 12:44 [hgb] 耶 稣 大 声 说 ， 信 我 的 ， 不 是 信 我 ， 乃 是 信 那 差 我 来 的 。 \n [kjv] Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. \n [bbe] Then Jesus said with a loud voice, He who has faith in me, has faith not in me, but in him who sent me. \n 12:45 [hgb] 人 看 见 我 ， 就 是 看 见 那 差 我 来 的 。 \n [kjv] And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. \n [bbe] And he who sees me, sees him who sent me. \n 12:46 [hgb] 我 到 世 上 来 ， 乃 是 光 ， 叫 凡 信 我 的 ， 不 住 在 黑 暗 里 。 \n [kjv] I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. \n [bbe] I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark. \n 12:47 [hgb] 若 有 人 听 见 我 的 话 不 遵 守 ， 我 不 审 判 他 。 我 来 本 不 是 要 审 判 世 界 ， 乃 是 要 拯 救 世 界 。 \n [kjv] And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. \n [bbe] And if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them, I am not his judge: I did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world. \n 12:48 [hgb] 弃 绝 我 不 领 受 我 话 的 人 ， 有 审 判 他 的 。 就 是 我 所 讲 的 道 ， 在 末 日 要 审 判 他 。 \n [kjv] He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. \n [bbe] He who puts me on one side and does not take my words to heart, is not without a judge: the word which I have said will be his judge on the last day. \n 12:49 [hgb] 因 为 我 没 有 凭 着 自 己 讲 。 惟 有 差 我 来 的 父 ， 已 经 给 我 命 令 ， 叫 我 说 什 么 ， 讲 什 么 。 \n [kjv] For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. \n [bbe] For I have not said it on my authority, but the Father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it. \n 12:50 [hgb] 我 也 知 道 他 的 命 令 就 是 永 生 。 故 此 我 所 讲 的 话 ， 正 是 照 着 父 对 我 所 说 的 。 \n [kjv] And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. \n [bbe] And I have knowledge that his order is eternal life: so that the things which I say, I say them even as the Father says them to me. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/157/2175.html","bookId":101,"book":{"id":101,"title":"约翰福音 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 太 初 有 道 ， 道 与 神 同 在 ， 道 就 是 神 。 [kjv] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
