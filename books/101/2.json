The mother of Jesus was there: \n 2:2 [hgb] 耶 稣 和 他 的 门 徒 也 被 请 去 赴 席 。 \n [kjv] And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. \n [bbe] And Jesus with his disciples came as guests. \n 2:3 [hgb] 酒 用 尽 了 ， 耶 稣 的 母 亲 对 他 说 ， 他 们 没 有 酒 了 。 \n [kjv] And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. \n [bbe] When they had not enough wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine. \n 2:4 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 母 亲 ， （ 原 文 作 妇 人 ） 我 与 你 有 什 么 相 干 。 我 的 时 候 还 没 有 到 。 \n [kjv] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. \n [bbe] Jesus said to her, Woman, this is not your business; my time is still to come. \n 2:5 [hgb] 他 母 亲 对 用 人 说 ， 他 告 诉 你 们 什 么 ， 你 们 就 作 什 么 。 \n [kjv] His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. \n [bbe] His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it. \n 2:6 [hgb] 照 犹 太 人 洁 净 的 规 矩 ， 有 六 口 石 缸 摆 在 那 里 ， 每 口 可 以 盛 两 三 桶 水 。 \n [kjv] And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. \n [bbe] Now six pots of stone, every one taking two or three firkins of water, were placed there for the purpose of washing, as is the way of the Jews. \n 2:7 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 用 人 说 ， 把 缸 倒 满 了 水 。 他 们 就 倒 满 了 ， 直 到 缸 口 。 \n [kjv] Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. \n [bbe] Jesus said to the servants, Make the pots full of water. And they made them full to the top. \n 2:8 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 说 ， 现 在 可 以 舀 出 来 ， 送 给 管 筵 席 的 。 他 们 就 送 了 去 。 \n [kjv] And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. \n [bbe] Then he said to them, Now take some, and give it to the master of the feast. So they took it to him. \n 2:9 [hgb] 管 筵 席 的 尝 了 那 水 变 的 酒 ， 并 不 知 道 是 哪 里 来 的 ， 只 有 舀 水 的 用 人 知 道 。 管 筵 席 的 便 叫 新 郎 来 。 \n [kjv] When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, \n [bbe] After tasting the water which had now become wine, the master of the feast (having no idea where it came from, though it was clear to the servants who took the water out) sent for the newly-married man, \n 2:10 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 人 都 是 先 摆 上 好 酒 。 等 客 喝 足 了 ， 才 摆 上 次 的 。 你 倒 把 好 酒 留 到 如 今 。 \n [kjv] And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. \n [bbe] And said to him, Every man first puts out his best wine and when all have had enough he puts out what is not so good; but you have kept the good wine till now. \n 2:11 [hgb] 这 是 耶 稣 所 行 的 头 一 件 神 迹 ， 是 在 加 利 利 的 迦 拿 行 的 ， 显 出 他 的 荣 耀 来 。 他 的 门 徒 就 信 他 了 。 \n [kjv] This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. \n [bbe] This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and let his glory be seen openly; and his disciples put their faith in him. \n 2:12 [hgb] 这 事 以 后 ， 耶 稣 与 他 的 母 亲 弟 兄 和 门 徒 ， 都 下 迦 百 农 去 。 在 那 里 住 了 不 多 几 日 。 \n [kjv] After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. \n [bbe] After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they were there not more than two or three days. \n 2:13 [hgb] 犹 太 人 的 逾 越 节 近 了 ， 耶 稣 就 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 。 \n [kjv] And the Jews\u0027 passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, \n [bbe] The time of the Passover of the Jews was near and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. \n 2:14 [hgb] 看 见 殿 里 有 卖 牛 羊 鸽 子 的 ， 并 有 兑 换 银 钱 的 人 ， 坐 在 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: \n [bbe] And there in the Temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves, and he saw the changers of money in their seats: \n 2:15 [hgb] 耶 稣 就 拿 绳 子 作 成 鞭 子 ， 把 牛 羊 都 赶 出 殿 去 。 倒 出 兑 换 银 钱 之 人 的 银 钱 ， 推 翻 他 们 的 桌 子 。 \n [kjv] And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers\u0027 money, and overthrew the tables; \n [bbe] And he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the Temple, with the sheep and the oxen, sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables; \n 2:16 [hgb] 又 对 卖 鸽 子 的 说 ， 把 这 些 东 西 拿 去 。 不 要 将 我 父 的 殿 ， 当 作 买 卖 的 地 方 。 \n [kjv] And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father\u0027s house an house of merchandise. \n [bbe] And to those who were trading in doves he said, Take these things away; do not make my Father\u0027s house a market. \n 2:17 [hgb] 他 的 门 徒 就 想 起 经 上 记 着 说 ， 我 为 你 的 殿 ， 心 里 焦 急 ， 如 同 火 烧 。 \n [kjv] And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. \n [bbe] And it came to the minds of the disciples that the Writings say, I am on fire with passion for your house. \n 2:18 [hgb] 因 此 ， 犹 太 人 问 他 说 ， 你 既 作 这 些 事 ， 还 显 什 么 神 迹 给 我 们 看 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? \n [bbe] Then the Jews put this question to him: What sign of authority have you to give us, seeing that you do these things? \n 2:19 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 们 拆 毁 这 殿 ， 我 三 日 内 要 再 建 立 起 来 。 \n [kjv] Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. \n [bbe] And Jesus said to them, Send destruction on this Temple and I will put it up again in three days. \n 2:20 [hgb] 犹 太 人 便 说 ， 这 殿 是 四 十 六 年 才 造 成 的 ， 你 三 日 内 就 再 建 立 起 来 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? \n [bbe] The Jews said, The building of this Temple took forty-six years; and you will put it up in three days! \n 2:21 [hgb] 但 耶 稣 这 话 ， 是 以 他 的 身 体 为 殿 。 \n [kjv] But he spake of the temple of his body. \n [bbe] But his words were about that holy building which was his body. \n 2:22 [hgb] 所 以 到 他 从 死 里 复 活 以 后 ， 门 徒 就 想 起 他 说 过 这 话 ， 便 信 了 圣 经 和 耶 稣 所 说 的 。 \n [kjv] When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. \n [bbe] So when he had come back again from the dead, the memory of these words came back to the disciples, and they had faith in the holy Writings and in the word which Jesus had said. \n 2:23 [hgb] 当 耶 稣 在 耶 路 撒 冷 过 逾 越 节 的 时 候 ， 有 许 多 人 看 见 他 所 行 的 神 迹 ， 就 信 了 他 的 名 。 \n [kjv] Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. \n [bbe] Now while he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, a great number of people came to have faith in his name, after seeing the signs which he did. \n 2:24 [hgb] 耶 稣 却 不 将 自 己 交 托 他 们 ， 因 为 他 知 道 万 人 。 \n [kjv] But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, \n [bbe] But Jesus did not have faith in them, because he had knowledge of them all. \n 2:25 [hgb] 也 用 不 着 谁 见 证 人 怎 样 。 因 他 知 道 人 心 里 所 存 的 。 \n [kjv] And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. \n [bbe] He had no need for any witness about man; for he himself had knowledge of what was in man. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/157/2165.html","bookId":101,"book":{"id":101,"title":"约翰福音 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 太 初 有 道 ， 道 与 神 同 在 ， 道 就 是 神 。 [kjv] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
