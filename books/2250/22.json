NETTLES CaUGHT MaTTHEW at the staircase when he returned to the mansion after his visit with Dr. Shields. \"The magistrate asked that you see him directly ye arrived. I ha\u0027 to tell you that the preacher\u0027s been here, and he was might loud.\"\\n\\n \"I expected it. Thank you.\" He braced himself for what was ahead and started up the stairs.\\n\\n \"Oh, sir!\" Mrs. Nettles said before he\u0027d gotten more than halfway up. \"I recalled somethin\u0027 I thought you might find of interest. about Rev\u0027rend Grove.\"\\n\\n \"Go on,\" Matthew urged.\\n\\n \"Well, sir . . . you asked if the rev\u0027rend had any enemies, and I said he had none I knew of. But I was thinkin\u0027 over it some, and I recall a strange thing happened - oh, I\u0027d say it was three or four days \u0027fore he was killed.\"\\n\\n \"What was iti\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027d come for dinner,\" she said. \"Had some business \u0027bout the church to talk over with Mr. Bidwell and Mr. Winston, so his wife had stayed home. I remember they were talkin\u0027 there in the parlor, with the fire goin\u0027.\" She nodded toward that room. \"Mr. Bidwell had walked with Mr. Winston out to the carriage. I had come in to ask the rev\u0027rend if I could refresh his cup, and he said no, that he was fine as he was. I turned my back and started to leave, and he says, \u0027Mrs. Nettlesi What would you do if you knew a thing, and tellin\u0027 it might be right but it would serve no good purposei\u0027 That\u0027s what he said.\"\\n\\n \"Did you ask what he meanti\"\\n\\n \"No sir, that would not have been proper. I told him I was nae one to be givin\u0027 advice to a man a\u0027 God, but that it depended on what it was he knew.\"\\n\\n \"and what was the reverend\u0027s responsei\"\\n\\n \"He just sat there, lookin\u0027 at the fire. I started out again, on my way to the kitchen, and then I heard him say, \u0027No Latin.\u0027 That was all, and he\u0027d said it so quiet I hardly heard it. But I said, \u0027Siri\u0027 \u0027cause I didn\u0027t know what he meant. He didn\u0027t answer; he was just sittin\u0027 there, lookin\u0027 at the fire and thinkin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Hm,\" Matthew grunted. \"You\u0027re sure he spoke those words, and not something elsei\"\\n\\n \"I heard him say, \u0027No Latin.\u0027 at least, it sounded like that to me. Then Mr. Bidwell came back in, and I went about my business.\"\\n\\n \"and you say Reverend Grove was killed three or four days afterwardi\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, he was. His wife found him, lyin\u0027 there on the church floor.\" She frowned. \"What do ye think he meanti\"\\n\\n \"I have no idea,\" Matthew said, \"but his question to you may mean that someone of physical rather than spectral nature had cause to wish him harm. I\u0027d very much like to find out what it might have been he knew. May I ask why you\u0027ve not brought this up beforei\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d forgot it, \u0027til this mornin\u0027. Bein\u0027 who he was, the rev\u0027rend knew a lot of things about a lot of people,\" she said. \"But like I told ye, he had no enemies.\"\\n\\n \"Obviously he did,\" Matthew corrected. \"Only it was someone who might have worn the disguise of being a friend.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, I suppose so.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you for telling me this.\" Matthew decided to store this information away and pursue it at a later date. Right now there was the magistrate to deal with. \"I\u0027d better go up.\" He ascended the stairs, his face grim.\\n\\n He had spoken to Dr. Shields at length concerning the magistrate\u0027s condition, and had been informed that though the sickness appeared serious it was well under control. The doctor said more bleeding would have to be done and there would be times when the magistrate would feel both better and then worse before he improved. But, said Dr. Shields, the road to recovery was never easy, especially from a malady such as this coastal fever. The magistrate was a strong specimen and otherwise in good health, Dr. Shields had said, therefore there was no reason he shouldn\u0027t respond to the bleeding and put this sickness behind him within a week or two.\\n\\n Matthew reached the magistrate\u0027s door and tentatively knocked. \"Who is iti\" came his voice: a weary but serviceable croaking.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s me, sir.\"\\n\\n There was a pointed silence. Then, \"Come in.\" Matthew entered. Woodward was still in bed, propped up by two pillows. The box of documents lay beside him, a sheaf of the papers on the blanket that covered his lap. Three candles burned on the bedside table. He didn\u0027t look up from his reading. \"Please close the door,\" he said, and Matthew obeyed. Woodward let his clerk stand there for a while; his throat was agonizing him again, his nostrils were swollen, his head ached, and he had a hellish mixture of chills and fever, so when Exodus Jerusalem had told him what Matthew had done it did no good to his nerves or temper. But Woodward kept himself calm and continued reading, unwilling yet to display one iota of anger.\\n\\n \"Siri\" Matthew said. \"I know you had a visit from - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m involved at the moment,\" Woodward interrupted. \"allow me to finish this page.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" He stared at the floor, his hands clasped behind him. Finally, he heard the magistrate put aside the documents and clear his throat with what sounded to be painful difficulty.\\n\\n \"as usual,\" Woodward began, \"you have done an admirable job. The papers are excellent.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"I should finish reading them tonight. Tomorrow morning at the latest. Oh, I\u0027ll be glad to get out of this place!\" He lifted a hand and massaged his tender throat; his shaving mirror had told him how bad he appeared - pasty-faced, dark hollows under the eyes, and a sheen of fever sweat on his cheeks and forehead. He was extremely tired as well, weakened by both the ravages of his illness and the bleeding lancet, and all he really cared to do was lie back in this bed and sleep. \"I\u0027m sure you shall be glad too, won\u0027t youi\"\\n\\n a trick, Matthew thought. So obvious it was hardly worth dodging. \"I\u0027ll be glad when justice is done, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Well, justice is about to be done. I shall deliver my decree tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Pardon me,\" Matthew said, \"but usually you spend at least two days reviewing the documents.\"\\n\\n \"Is it etched in stonei No, I hardly need to read these papers.\"\\n\\n \"Does it matter at all that I feel - very strongly - that Rachel Howarth is neither a murderess nor a witchi\"\\n\\n \"Evidence, Matthew.\" Woodward tapped the sheaf of papers. \"The evidence is right here. You heard it, and you recorded it. There are the poppets on the dresser over there. Tell me what evidence refutes the testimonyi\" Matthew remained silent. \"None,\" Woodward said. \"Your opinion, and your opinion only.\"\\n\\n \"But do you agree that some of the testimony is questionablei\"\\n\\n \"I find the witnesses to be credible. How do you explain that all their stories have overlapping elementsi\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Woodward swallowed and winced at the pain. He had to speak, though, while his voice had at least a minimum of strength. \"You know what will be best for this town, just as I do. I don\u0027t relish it. But it has to be done.\"\\n\\n \"Will you not allow me time to ask some more questions, siri I believe that Violet adams may - \"\\n\\n \"No,\" came the firm answer. \"Leave that child alone. and I want you to stay away from the gaol, from this minute on.\"\\n\\n Matthew took a deep breath. He said, \"I believe I should be able to go where I please, sir.\" He saw the fire jump into Woodward\u0027s eyes, even as sick as the magistrate was. \"If you are basing your restrictions on what Exodus Jerusalem told you, I might inform you that the preacher has filthy designs on Madam Howarth. He wants her to confess and throw herself at your mercy, whereupon he will step in and vouch for her newfound Christian soul. His aim is to recruit her as his travelling doxy.\"\\n\\n Woodward started to speak, but his voice cracked and so he had to pause until he regained it. When he was able, he said, \"I don\u0027t give a damn about Exodus Jerusalem! Of course he\u0027s a scoundrel. I knew that the minute I saw him. My concern is your soul.\"\\n\\n \"My soul is well protected,\" Matthew answered.\\n\\n \"Is iti Reallyi\" Woodward stared up at the ceiling for a time, composing his thoughts. \"Matthew,\" he said, \"I fear for you. That woman . . . she can do you some harm, if she pleases.\"\\n\\n \"I can take care of myself.\"\\n\\n at that Woodward had to laugh, though it fiercely pained him. \"The famous last words of a million sons to their fathers!\"\\n\\n \"I am not your son,\" Matthew said, a muscle clenching in his jaw. \"You are not my father. We have a professional relationship, sir, and that is all.\"\\n\\n Woodward didn\u0027t reply, but simply closed his eyes and rested his head on the pillows. His breathing was slow and steady, if somewhat ragged-sounding. He opened his eyes and looked directly at Matthew. \"The time has come,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Siri\"\\n\\n \"The time,\" Woodward repeated, \"has come. To tell you things . . . that perhaps should already have been told. Sit down, if you like.\" He nodded toward the chair that was placed close beside the bed, and Matthew sat down upon it.\\n\\n \"Where to begini\" It was a question the magistrate had posed to himself. \"The beginning, of course. When I was a prosperous attorney, I lived in London with my wife, ann. We had a very fine house. a garden in the back, with a fountain. Oxford had prepared me well.\" He gave Matthew a slight, sad smile, and then it went away. \"We had been wed two years when we had a son, whom we named Thomas, after my father.\"\\n\\n \"a soni\" This was an amazement to Matthew.\\n\\n \"Yes. a good boy he was. Very intelligent, very . . . serious, I suppose. He loved for me to read to him, and he loved to hear his mother sing.\" Woodward heard in his mind the woman\u0027s sweet soprano and saw shadows on the green Italian tiles that graced the fountain. \"Those were the finest days of my life,\" he said as softly as his tortured voice would allow. \"On our fifth anniversary, I presented ann with a silver music box, and she gave me the gold-striped waistcoat. I remember the moment I opened the wrapping. I recall thinking . . . that no man on earth had ever been so fortunate. So privileged to be alive. There I was, with my loved ones before me, my house, my possessions, my career. I had tasted the full fruit of life and I was a rich man. Rich in so many ways.\"\\n\\n Matthew said nothing, but now he more fully understood the magistrate\u0027s anguish at leaving the treasured garment in Shawcombe\u0027s hands.\\n\\n \"Four years later,\" Woodward continued after a painful swallow, \"ann and my partners encouraged me to pursue the robe. I passed the necessary examinations . . . became a jurist apprentice. In time I was informed I would advance when the next appointments were made.\" He drew a long, suffering breath and let it go. \"I didn\u0027t have long to wait. That summer the plague came. Many openings were created.\"\\n\\n Woodward lapsed into silence as the memories came up around him like so many whispering ghosts. \"The plague,\" he said, his gaze fixed on nothing. \"Summer ended. a wet and nasty autumn, and the plague remained. It was a visitation of blisters on the flesh, followed by fits and terrible agonies until death. I saw my closest friend die that September. He withered from a sturdy athlete into a weeping skeleton in the space of two weeks. and then . . . one morning in October . . . the maidservant screamed in Thomas\u0027s bedchamber. I rushed in. Knowing already. and fearing what I would find.\"\\n\\n His voice had dwindled to a mere whisper and his throat was a burning hellpit, yet he felt the necessity to go on. \"Thomas was twelve years old. The plague cared not for age, nor social position, nor riches nor . . . anything. It set in on Thomas ... as if determined to destroy not only him, but his mother and myself. The best the doctors could do was sedate him with opium. It was not enough to make him stop hurting. Not nearly enough.\"\\n\\n He had to halt once more to swallow, and felt the scum of infection ooze down his throat.\\n\\n \"May I get you something to drinki\" Matthew asked, standing up.\\n\\n \"No. Sit down. I must speak while I can.\" He waited for Matthew ro settle himself again. \"Thomas fought it,\" he said. \"But of course ... he could not win. His skin was so raw he couldn\u0027t turn over in bed. Once . . . when a fit struck him, he thrashed so much that the flesh . . . peeled from his back like wet bark from a rotten tree. and everything was blood and pestilence and that smell . . . that smell . . . that death-reeking, hideous smell.\"\\n\\n \"Sir,\" Matthew said, \"you don\u0027t have to - \"\\n\\n Woodward lifted a hand. \"Please hear me out. Thomas lived for ten days after he was afflicted. No, lived is not the correct word. Survived. The days and nights were of indistinguishable damnation for us all. He vomited torrents of blood. His eyes were swollen closed from crying, and he lay in filth because we had no help and ... we could not wash the sheets fast enough. On the last day ... he was seized by uncontrollable fits. So strong he grasped hold of the iron bedstead, and the bowing of his body . . . made the entire bed jump up and down . . . like some demonic toy. I remember his face, in that final hour. His face.\" Woodward squeezed his eyes shut, sweat glistening on his cheeks, and Matthew could barely look at him, so awful was the sight of his soul-caged grief.\\n\\n \"Oh, my God, his face,\" the magistrate rasped. His eyes opened, and Matthew saw they had gone red with the memory of such torment. \"The pox . . . had consumed most of his face. at the end, he . . . hardly appeared human. as he was dying . . . being racked by those fits ... he gripped the bedstead with all his remaining strength. I saw his fingers tighten . . . tighten . . . and he looked at me.\" Woodward nodded, marking the moment. \"He couldn\u0027t speak, but I saw him ask a question of me, as if I had been God almighty. He asked me: Whyi and to that question - that unknown, unfathomable question - I was mute. Hardly ten minutes later ... he let loose a groan, and at last he left us. I had such plans for him. Such plans. and I loved him, more than I had even known.\\n\\n \"His death . . . the way he died . . . could not help but taint the rest of our days,\" Woodward said. \"ann had always been fragile .. . now her mind was blighted. Her spirit grew dark, as did mine. She turned against me. She could no longer bear to live in that house, and she began to suffer violent rages. I think . . . she was so frustrated ... so angry against God . . . that she was reduced to the impulses of an animal.\" He paused and swallowed. \"Took to drink. Took to being seen in unsavory places . . . with unsavory people. I reached out for her, tried to get her into church, but that made things worse. I believe . . . she needed someone to hate on this earth as much as she hated the Lord. Finally, she left the house. I was told that ann had been seen drunk in a certain neighborhood, in the company of a man of ill repute. My career began to suffer. It was rumored that I was a drunk as well - which was sometimes true - and that I was open to bribes. Which was never true. a convenient lie for some persons who wished me harm. My debts came due, as debts will when a man is down. I sold most of what I owned. The house . . . the garden, the fountain, the bed upon which Thomas had died ... all of it was repugnant to me, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"But you kept the waistcoat,\" Matthew said.\\n\\n \"Yes. Because ... I don\u0027t know why. Or perhaps I do. It was one item of my past. . . that remained clean and unblemished. It was ... a breath of yesterday, when all the world was fragrant.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Matthew said. \"I had no idea.\"\\n\\n \"Well, why would youi Over time . . . the cases I heard grew fewer. I must say much of my disgrace was my fault, as I allowed Brother Rum to accompany me to the bench. I decided ... as my future appeared to be dim in London, I might try my torch in the colonies. But before I left ... I tried to find ann. I heard she\u0027d fallen in with other women of her class who had . . . experienced the deaths of their husbands by the plague, and who had become . . . rumpots and flesh merchants by necessity. By this time, she was completely gone to me. Gone to herself, as well.\" He gave a labored sigh. \"I think that\u0027s what she wished. To lose her identity, and thus the past.\" He stared past Matthew, into the incalculable distance. \"I believe I saw her. In a crowd at the harbor. I wasn\u0027t sure. I didn\u0027t care to be sure. I walked away Later I boarded a ship . . . and hence to a new world.\"\\n\\n Woodward lay his head back and closed his eyes again. He swallowed pus and tried to clear his throat, to no avail. His voice was all but gone now, yet he forced himself on because he feared so for Matthew\u0027s soul and wished him to understand these things. \"Imagine my surprise ... to find that Manhattan was not paved with gold. I found that the New World ... is no different from the Old. There are the same passions and crimes. The same sins and scoundrels. Only here . . . there\u0027s so much more opportunity to sin . . . and so much more space in which to do it. God only knows what the next century will bring.\"\\n\\n \"I spoke with Goode about that,\" Matthew said, offering a trace of a smile. \"His wife believes the world will be destroyed by fire, while he believes it might be - as he put it - a \u0027century of wonders.\u0027\"\\n\\n Woodward opened his bloodshot eyes. \"I don\u0027t know . . . but I do believe it will be a wonder if Fount Royal reaches the new century. This town will surely die if Rachel Howarth is not executed.\"\\n\\n Matthew\u0027s smile vanished. \"Is the future of this settlement your basis for putting a woman to death, siri\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. Not entirely, I mean. But the evidence is there . . . the witnesses . . . the poppets . . . her own blasphemous demeanor. Not to mention her grip on you.\"\\n\\n \"What gripi I fail to see how my interest in the truth can be construed as - \"\\n\\n \"Cease and desist,\" Woodward said. \"Please. The more you go on, the less you convince anyone . . . least of all me. I daresay it is not only Jerusalem who has designs on the woman . . . though I believe it\u0027s actually she who has designs on you.\"\\n\\n Matthew shook his head. \"You\u0027re absolutely wrong.\"\\n\\n \"I have heard enough cases. To know how blinding is the fire of temptation. and how hot it burns.\" Woodward massaged his throat once more. \"My voice is near its end, but this I have to tell you,\" he whispered. \"There was once a merchant. an eager, industrious young man. His business . . . required him to rise early and thus to bed early. But one evening ... he stayed awake past his usual hour . . . and in so doing he heard the wondrous singing of something he\u0027d never heard before: a nightbird. The next night, he managed to stay awake later ... to hear more of the bird\u0027s song. and the following night. He became so ... so intoxicated with the nightbird\u0027s voice that he thought only of it during the day. Came the time when he spent all the night listening to that song. Could not carry out his business during the sunlit hours. Soon he turned his back altogether on the day, and gave himself over to the nightbird\u0027s beautiful voice . . . much to the sad end of his career, his health . . . eventually his life.\"\\n\\n \"a fine parable,\" Matthew said curtly. \"Is there a point to iti\"\\n\\n \"You know its point. a parable, yes, but there\u0027s great truth and warning in it.\" He gave Matthew a piercing stare. \"It is not enough to love the nightbird\u0027s song. One must also love the nightbird. and . . . one must eventually fall in love with the night itself.\"\\n\\n \"You mistake my motives. I am simply interested in - \"\\n\\n \"Helping her,\" Woodward interrupted. \"Finding the truth. Being of service. However you choose to phrase it . . . Rachel Howarth is your nightbird, Matthew. I\u0027d be no guardian if I saw you in danger of being consumed by the darkness and failed to warn you.\"\\n\\n \"Consumed by the darknessi\" Matthew raised his eyebrows. \"I think that\u0027s an overstatement, sir.\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s an understatement.\" Woodward gazed up at the ceiling, his strength almost expired. He felt as if his body were a cumbersome clay jar being baked over a fire, his true self trapped within it and yearning for a breath of clean, cool air. \"That woman has entranced you, for her own purposes. She wants nothing more of you . . . than to help her escape the stake . . . which would be a sin that would forever mark you in the eyes of God.\"\\n\\n Matthew stood up, unwilling to listen to such nonsense. It occurred to him to stalk out of the room, but he did not because he knew the magistrate was sincere and also that he would regret such rashness. \"Siri May I ask you a question, and request that you think hard on it before you answeri\"\\n\\n a nod gave him permission.\\n\\n \"Do you honestly - with all your heart and soul - believe that Rachel is a witchi\"\\n\\n \"Your question ... is weighted on the side of emotion,\" Woodward answered. \"I have responsibility to uphold and carry out the law. The evidence tells me she is a witch . . . therefore I must apply the law in its strictest measure.\"\\n\\n \"Put aside the robe for one moment, and then reply.\"\\n\\n \"I am satisfied,\" came the firm response. \"Yes, there are missing details. Yes, there are questions I would have answered, and more witnesses interviewed. But ... I must proceed on what I have. and what I have . . . obvious to both of us ... is testimony and physical evidence any judge would rule sufficient to burn her. She knows it. She must find a way to escape . . . and that involves you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d think Satan would free her, if she were really his servant.\"\\n\\n \"Servants are cheap,\" Woodward said. \"I think ... it suits Satan\u0027s purpose to stand aside and let his nightbird speak.\"\\n\\n Matthew started to parry the thrust, but he realized it was no use. They had come to an impasse, and beyond it they could not travel together.\\n\\n \"I will continue to read through the documents,\" the magistrate offered. \"I would not wish to present my decree with any undue haste.\"\\n\\n \"May I read what you\u0027ve already gone throughi\"\\n\\n \"as you wish.\" Woodward picked up the sheaf of papers and put them into his clerk\u0027s hands. \"Beware, though ... no further words on this matter. Do you hear mei\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Matthew said, though the agreement had a bitter taste.\\n\\n \"and you\u0027ll not return to see Madam Howarthi\"\\n\\n This was a more difficult point. Matthew didn\u0027t have to ponder it. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I can\u0027t promise that.\"\\n\\n The magistrate pursed his lips and released a forlorn exhalation. He too, however, had realized the limits of Matthew\u0027s obedience. \"Your choice,\" he whispered. \"I pray to God it is a wise one.\" Then he motioned toward the door. \"Go. I need my rest.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" Matthew stared at Woodward for a moment, studying the angles and planes of the man\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"What is iti\" Woodward asked.\\n\\n \"I have to ask this, sir. Did you come to the almshouse in search of a clerk, or a replacement for your soni\"\\n\\n \"My son . . . could never be replaced.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m aware of that. But you and I both know you might have secured an experienced clerk through a legal office. I had to ask, that\u0027s all.\" He turned and went to the door.\\n\\n \"Matthewi\" Woodward pushed himself up on his pillows, his face bleached with pain. \"I don\u0027t know ... if I came looking for a son or not. Perhaps I did. But I do know I wanted to shape someone. I wanted to . . . protect someone ... to keep him clean, from this filthy world. Do you understandi\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" Matthew replied. \"and I wish to thank you for your concern on my behalf. If you hadn\u0027t removed me from that place, I dread to think what might have become of me.\"\\n\\n Woodward eased himself back down. \"The whole world is before you. You have a bright future. Please . . . beware those who would destroy it, I beg you.\"\\n\\n Matthew left the room with the sheaf of papers under his arm, and in his own room he lit a candle, washed his face with cool water, and then opened the shutters. The light was almost gone, but he looked out across the slaves\u0027 quarters toward the watchman\u0027s tower and the swamp beyond. It seemed to him now that one might wander into a morass at any time, anywhere, without warning. There were no easy answers to any question in this world, and it seemed that year after year the questions grew more complicated.\\n\\n He did believe that the magistrate had entered the almshouse searching for a son. How it must agonize Woodward now, to think he might lose another one to the corruption of circumstance. But as much as Matthew felt for the magistrate, he would not - could not- - turn away from Rachel. He might be a substitute for a son, yes . . . but he was also a man, and he must do what he thought to be the correct thing.\\n\\n Which meant fighting to prove her innocence, right up to the moment of her execution.\\n\\n Nightbird or not, she had indeed spoken to him. He heard her even now, suffering in the darkness of her cage. What was he going to do tomorrow, when the magistrate asked him to prepare the decree of death and sign it as a witness beneath Woodward\u0027s seali\\n\\n He set the candle down and reclined on his bed - carefully, as the stripes on his back were hot. Then he began reading the court documents in the hope that something in them would lead him to a fact that had been overlooked, and that single fact might be the key to Rachel\u0027s freedom.\\n\\n But he feared it would not be there.\\n\\n Time was very short now. If Satan indeed dwelled in Fount Royal, Matthew presumed he must be grinning. Or if not Satan...then the grin belonged to someone else. a true fox, as Mrs. Nettles had said.\\n\\n But even the most crafty fox left a trace of its passage, Matthew believed. It was up to him to find it, with all the bloodhound instincts in his possession. If they failed him, Rachel was lost, and he himself was damned to a fate he considered worse than the flames of Hell: the struggle with unanswerable questions that would haunt him to his grave. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-22.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \\n Judgment of the Witch \\n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
