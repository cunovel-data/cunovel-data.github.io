{"id":85921,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"THE FOREMOST GROUP of them backed away, heeding the doctor\u0027s continued shouts. as Matthew and Rachel followed the loinclothed healer, the Indians trailed in their wake and the shouting, giggling, and excited vocals began to surge loudly again.\n Matthew would have never dreamed in a barrel of rum that he might have found himself naked before the world, clinging to Rachel and walking through a horde of grinning, hollering Indians. His vision was returning, though he was still overwhelmed by all this light. He saw a score of round wooden huts, some covered with dried mud and others moss-grown, with roofs upon which grass grew as thickly as from the earth. He caught sight of a lush plot of cornstalks that would have dropped the farmers of Fount Royal to their knees. Two dogs - one gray and the other dark brown - came to sniff around Matthew\u0027s legs, but a shout from the doctor sent them running. The same happened when a giggling pack of four naked brown children neared the pallid patient, and they ran away squealing and jumping.\n Matthew saw that most of the men - who shared the doctor\u0027s narrow facial structure, lean body, and topknot of hair growing from an otherwise shaved head - were nearly nude, but the women were clothed in either deerskin garments or brightly dyed shifts that appeared to be woven from cotton. Some of the females, however, had chosen to let their breasts be bared, a sight that would have made the citizens of Fount Royal swoon. Their feet were either bare or clad in deerskin slippers. Many of the men were adorned with intricate blue-dye tattoos, and also a few of the older women. These tattoos appeared not only on the face but also on the chest, arms, thighs, and presumably just about everywhere else.\n The mood was festive. Men and women were childlike in their glee, and the children - of which there were many - like little scampering squirrels. Of real creatures, there were aplenty as well: pigs, chickens, and a barking battery of dogs. Then the doctor led Matthew and Rachel to a hut that seemed to be centrally located within the village, drew back a buckskin decorated with blade carvings to gain admittance, and escorted the visitors into the cool, dimly lit interior.\n The light came from small flames burning in clay bowls that held pools of oil, set in a circle. Facing this circle, a man sat cross-legged on a dais supported by wooden poles about three feet off the ground, and cushioned by various animal skins.\n It was the sight of this man that made Matthew stop in his tracks. His mouth opened and his teeth might have fallen out, so great was his shock.\n The man - who obviously was the village\u0027s chief, governor, lord, or however the savages termed him - wore a buckskin loincloth that barely covered his genitalia. That, however, was by now a commonplace. What so shocked Matthew was that the chief had a long, white, tightly curled judicial wig on his head, and his chest was covered by...\n I\u0027m dreaming! Matthew thought. I have to be insensible to imagine this!\n ... Magistrate Woodward\u0027s gold-striped waistcoat.\n \"Pata ne.\" The doctor motioned Matthew and Rachel into the circle, and then made gestures for them to sit. \"Oha! Oha!\"\n Rachel obeyed. When Matthew started to lower himself, pain stabbed his ribs and he clutched at the clay bandage, his face tightening.\n \"Uh!\" the chief spoke. He had the long-jawed, narrow face and wore circular blue tattoos on both cheeks, more tattoos trailing down his arms, like blue vines, and covering his hands. The tips of his fingers were dyed red. \"Se na oha! Pah ke ne su na oha sau-papa!\" His commanding voice instantly stirred the doctor to action, namely that of grasping Matthew\u0027s right arm and pulling him up straight. When Rachel saw, she thought the chief wanted her to rise as well, but as she began to stand she was pushed down again - rather firmly - by the doctor.\n The chief stood up on his dais. His legs were tattooed from the knees to the bare feet. He put his hands on his hips, his deep-set black eyes fixed on Matthew, and his expression serious as demanded his position of authority. \"Te te weya, \" he said. The doctor retreated, walking backward, and left the hut. The next words were directed at Matthew: \"Urn ta ka pa pe nei\"\n Matthew simply shook his head. He saw that the chief wore Woodward\u0027s prized waistcoat unbuttoned, and more tattoos adorned his chest. Though age was difficult to estimate among these foreign people, Matthew thought the chief was a young man, possibly only five or six years older than himself.\n \"Oumi\" the chief asked, frowning. \"Ka taynay calmeti\"\n again, Matthew could only shake his head.\n The chief looked down at the ground for a moment, and crossed his arms over his chest. He sighed and seemed lost in thought; deliberating, Matthew feared, how best to murder his captives.\n Then the chief lifted his gaze again and said, \"Quel chapeau portez-vousi\"\n Matthew now almost fell down. The Indian had spoken French. a bizarre question, yes, but French all the same. The question had been: \"What hat do you weari\"\n Matthew had to steady himself. That this tattooed savage could speak a classic European language boggled the mind. It was such a jolt that Matthew even forgot for a few seconds that he was standing there totally naked. He replied, \"Je ne porte pas de chapeau.\" Meaning \"I don\u0027t wear a hat.\"\n \"ah ah!\" The chief offered a genuine smile that served to further light and warm the chamber. He clapped his hands together, as if equally amazed and delighted at Matthew\u0027s understanding of the language. \"Tous les hommes portent des chapeaux. Mon chapeau est Nawpawpay. Quel chapeau portez-vousi\"\n Matthew now understood. The chief had said, \"all men wear hats. My hat is Nawpawpay. What hat do you weari\"\n \"Oh, \" Matthew said, nodding. \"Mon chapeau est Mathieu.\"\n \"Mathieu, \" Nawpawpay repeated, as if testing its weight on his tongue. \"Mathieu... Matthew, \" he said, still speaking French. \"That is a strange hat.\"\n \"Possibly it is, but it\u0027s the hat I was given at birth.\"\n \"ah! But you\u0027ve been reborn now, and so you must be given a new hat. I myself will give it to you: Demon Slayer.\"\n \"Demon Slayeri I don\u0027t understand.\" He glanced down at Rachel, who - not having a grasp of French - was totally confounded at what they were saying.\n \"Did you not slay the demon that almost took your lifei The demon that has roamed this land for... oh... only the dead souls know, my father among them. I can\u0027t say how many brothers and sisters have passed away by those claws and fangs. But we tried to slay that beast. Yes, we tried.\" He nodded, his expression grave again. \"and when we tried, the demon worked its evil on us. For every arrow that was shot into its body, it delivered ten curses. Our male infants died, our crops withered, the fishing was poor, and our seers had dreams of the end of time. So we stopped trying, for our own lives. Then everything got better, but the beast was always hungry. You seei None of us could slay it. The forest demons look after their own kind.\"\n \"But the beast still lives, \" Matthew said.\n \"No! I was told how the hunters saw you travelling, and followed you. Then the beast struck! I was told how it attacked you, and how you stood before it and gave a mighty war cry. That must have been a sight to see! They said it was hurt. I sent some men. They found it, dead in its den.\"\n \"Oh, I see. But... it was old and tired. I think it was already dying.\"\n Nawpawpay shrugged. \"That may be so, Matthew, but who struck the last blowi They found your knife, still under here.\" He pressed beneath his own chin with a forefinger. \"ah, if it\u0027s the forest demons that concern you, you may rest knowing they only haunt our kind. Your kind frightens them.\"\n \"Of that I have no doubt, \" Matthew said.\n Rachel could stand it no longer. \"Matthew! What\u0027s he sayingi\"\n \"They found the bear dead and they believe I killed it. He\u0027s given me a new name: Demon Slayer.\"\n \"Is it French you\u0027re speakingi\"\n \"Yes, it is. I have no idea how - \"\n \"an interruption, my pardon, \" Nawpawpay said. \"How is it you come to know King LaPierre\u0027s tonguei\"\n Matthew shifted his thinking from English back to French once more. \"King LaPierrei\"\n \"Yes, from the kingdom of Franz Europay. are you a member of his tribei\"\n \"No, I\u0027m not.\"\n \"But you\u0027ve had some word from himi\" It was said with eagerness. \"When will he return to this landi\"\n \"Um... well... I\u0027m not certain, \" Matthew said. \"When was he last herei\"\n \"Oh, during my grandfather\u0027s father\u0027s time. He left his tongue with my family, as he said it was the tongue of kings. Do I speak it welli\"\n \"Yes, very well.\"\n \"ah!\" Nawpawpay beamed like a little boy. \"I do recite it, so as not to lose its taste. King LaPierre showed us sticks that shot fire, and he caught our faces in a pouch pond. and... he had a little moon that sang. all these are carved down on the tablet.\"\n He frowned, perplexed. \"I do wish he would return, so I might see those wonders as my grandfather\u0027s father did. I feel I\u0027m missing something. You\u0027re not of his familyi Then how do you speak the king\u0027s tonguei\"\n \"I learned it from a member of King LaPierre\u0027s tribe, \" Matthew decided to say.\n \"I see now! Someday... someday...\" He lifted a finger for emphasis. \"I shall go over the water in a cloudboat to Franz Europay. I shall walk in that village and see for myself the hut of King LaPierre. It must be a grand place, with a hundred pigs!\"\n \"Matthew!\" Rachel said, about to go mad from this conversation of which she could not partake. \"What is he sayingi\"\n \"Your woman, sad to say, is not civilized like you and I, \" Nawpawpay ventured. \"She speaks mud words like that white fish we caught.\"\n \"White fishi\" Matthew asked. He motioned for Rachel to remain quiet. \"What white fishi\"\n \"Oh, he\u0027s nothing. Less than nothing, for he\u0027s a murderer and thief. The least civilized beast I have ever had the misfortune to look upon. Now: can you tell me anything more of the village of Franz Europayi\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you everything I know of that place, \" Matthew answered, \"if you\u0027ll tell me about the white fish. Did you... find your present clothing... and your headdress, at his huti\"\n \"Thesei Yes. are they not wonderfuli\" He spread his arms wide, grinning, so as to better display the gold-striped waistcoat.\n \"May I ask what else you found therei\"\n \"Other things. They must have some use, but I just like to look at them. and... of course... I found my woman.\"\n \"Your womani\"\n \"Yes, my bride. My princess.\" His grin now threatened to slice his face in two. \"The silent and lovely one. Oh, she shall share all my treasures and give me a hut full of sons! First, though, I\u0027ll have to make her fat.\"\n \"and what of the white fishi Where is hei\"\n \"Not far. There were two other fish - old ones - but they have gone.\"\n \"Gonei To wherei\"\n \"Everywhere, \" Nawpawpay said, spreading his arms wide again. \"The wind, the earth, the trees, the sky. You know.\"\n Matthew feared that he did know. \"But you say the white fish is still herei\"\n \"Yes, still here.\" Nawpawpay scratched his chin. \"You have a nature full of questions, don\u0027t youi\"\n \"It\u0027s just that... I might know him.\"\n \"Only uncivilized beasts and dung buzzards know him. He is unclean.\"\n \"Yes, I agree, but... why do you say he\u0027s a murderer and thiefi\"\n \"Because he is what he is!\" Like a child, Nawpawpay put his hands behind himself and began to bounce up and down on his toes. \"He murdered one of my people and stole a courage sun. another of my people saw it happen. We took him. Took them all. They were all guilty. all except my princess. She is innocent. Do you know how I know thati Because she was the only one who came willingly.\"\n \"a courage suni\" Matthew realized he must mean the gold coin. \"What is thati\"\n \"That which the water spirit gives.\" His bouncing ceased. \"Go visit the white fish, if you like. See if you know him, and ask him to tell you what crimes he\u0027s committed.\"\n \"Where can I find himi\"\n \"This direction.\" Nawpawpay pointed to Matthew\u0027s left. \"The hut that stands nearest the woodpile. You will know it.\"\n \"What\u0027s he pointing to, Matthewi\" Rachel asked. \"Does he want us to go somewherei\" She started to stand.\n \"ah, no no!\" Nawpawpay said quickly. \"a woman doesn\u0027t stand before me in this place.\"\n \"Rachel, please stay where you are.\" Matthew rested his hand on her shoulder. \"Evidently it\u0027s the chief\u0027s rule.\" Then, to Nawpawpay, \"Might she go with me to see the white fishi\"\n \"No. That hut is not a woman\u0027s territory. You go and come back.\"\n \"I\u0027m going to go somewhere for a short time, \" he told her. \"You\u0027ll need to stay here. all righti\"\n \"Where are you goingi\" She grasped his hand.\n \"There\u0027s another white captive here, and I want to see him. It won\u0027t take long.\"\n He squeezed her hand and gave her a tight but reassuring smile. Rachel nodded and reluctantly let go.\n \"Oh... one other thing, \" Matthew said to Nawpawpay. \"Might I have some clothingi\"\n \"Whyi are you cold on such a hot day as thisi\"\n \"Not cold. But there is a little too much air here for my comfort.\" He gestured toward his exposed penis and testicles.\n \"ah, I see! Very well, I shall give you a gift.\" Nawpawpay stepped out of his own loincloth and offered it.\n Matthew got the thing on with a delicate balancing act, since he was able only to use one arm. \"I\u0027ll return presently, \" he told Rachel. Then he retreated from the hut, out into the bright sun.\n The hut and the woodpile were not fifty paces from the chief\u0027s abode. a small band of chattering, giggling children clung to his shadow as he walked, and two of them ran round and round him as if to mock his slow, pained progress. When he neared the hut, however, they saw his destination, fell back, and ran away.\n Nawpawpay had been correct, in saying that Matthew would know the place.\n Blood had been painted on the outside walls, in strange patterns that a Christian would say was evidence of the Indians\u0027 Satanic nature. Flies feasted on the gore paintings and buzzed about the entrance, which was covered with a black bearskin.\n Matthew stood outside for a moment, steeling himself. This looked very bad indeed. With a trembling hand, he pulled aside the bearskin. Bitter blue smoke drifted into his face. There was only a weak red illumination within, perhaps the red embers of a past fire still glowing.\n \"Shawcombei\" Matthew called. There was no answer. \"Shaw-combe, can you hear mei\" Nothing.\n Matthew could make out only vague shapes through the smoke. \"Shawcombei\" he tried again, but in the silence that followed he knew he was going to have to cross the dreadful threshold.\n He took a breath of the sulphuric air and entered. The bearskin closed behind him. He stood where he was for a moment, waiting for his eyes to grow used to such darkness again. The awful, suffocating heat coaxed beads of sweat from his pores. To his right he could make out a large clay pot full of seething coals from which the light and smoke emitted.\n Something moved - a slow, slow shifting - there on his left.\n \"Shawcombei\" Matthew said, his eyes burning. He moved toward the left, as currents of smoke undulated before him.\n Presently, with some straining of the vision, he could make out an object. It looked like a raw and bloody side of beef that had been strung up to dry, and in fact was hanging from cords that were supported further up in the rafters.\n Matthew neared it, his heart slamming.\n Whatever hung there, it was just a slab of flayed meat with neither arms nor legs. Matthew stopped, tendrils of smoke drifting past his face. He couldn\u0027t bear to go any further, because he knew.\n Perhaps he made a sound. a moan, a gasp... something. But - as slowly as the tortures of the inner circle of Hell - the scalped and blood-caked head on that slab of meat moved. It lolled to one side, and then the chin lifted.\n His eyes were there, bulging from their sockets in that hideously swollen, black-bruised, and black-bloodied face. He had no eyelids. His nose had been cleaved off, as had been his lips and ears. a thousand tiny cuts had been administered to the battered torso, the genitals had been burned away and the wound cauterized to leave a glistening ebony crust. Likewise sealed with terrible fire were the hacked-off stumps of arms and legs. The cords had been tied and knotted around those grue-somely axed ruins.\n If there was a description for the utter horror that wracked Matthew, it was known only by the most profane demon and the most sacred angel.\n The motion of that lifted chin was enough to cause the torso to swing slightly on its cords. Matthew heard the ropes squeak up in the rafters, like the rats that had plagued Shawcombe\u0027s tavern.\n Back and forth, and back and forth.\n The lipless mouth stretched open. They had spared his tongue, so that he might cry for mercy with every knife slash, hatchet blow, and kiss of flame.\n He spoke, in a dry rattling whisper that was almost beyond all endurance to hear. \"Papai\" The word was as mangled as his mouth. \"Wasn\u0027t me killed the kitten, was Jamey done it.\" His chest shuddered and a wrenching sob came out. The bulging eyes stared at nothing. His was the small, crushed whine of a terrified child: \"Papa please... don\u0027t hurt me no more...\"\n The brutalized bully began to weep.\n Matthew turned - his eyes seared by smoke and sight - and fled lest his own mind be broken like Lucretia Vaughan\u0027s pie dish.\n He got outside, was further blinded and disoriented by the glare. He staggered, was aware of more naked children ringing him, jumping and chattering, their grins joyful even as they danced in the shadow of the torture hut. Matthew nearly fell in his attempts to get away, and his herky-jerky flailing to retain his balance made the children scream with laughter, as if they thought he was joining in their dance. Cold sweat clung to his face, his insides heaved, and he had to bend over and throw up on the ground, which made the children laugh and leap with new energy.\n He staggered on, the pack of little revelers now joined by a brown dog with one ear. a fog had descended over him, and he knew not if he was going in the right direction amid the huts. His progress attracted some older residents who put aside their seed-gathering and basket-weaving to accompany the merry throng, as if he were some potentate or nobleman whose fame rivalled the very sun. The laughter and hollering swelled as did the numbers of his followers, which only served to heighten Matthew\u0027s terror. Dogs barked at his heels and children darted underfoot. His ribs were killing him, but what was paini In his dazed stupor he realized he had never known pain, not an ounce of it, compared to what Shawcombe had suffered. Beyond the grinning brown faces he saw sunlight glitter, and suddenly there was water before him and he fell to his knees to plunge his face into it, mindless of the agony that seized his bones.\n He drank like an animal and trembled like an animal. a fit of strangulation struck him and he coughed violently, water bursting from his nostrils. Then he sat back on his haunches, his face dripping, as behind him the throng continued its jubilations.\n He sat on the bank of a pond. It was half the size of Fount Royal\u0027s spring, but its water was equally blue. Matthew saw two women nearby, both filling animal-skin bags. The sunlight glittered golden off the pond\u0027s surface, putting him in mind of the day he\u0027d seen the sun shine with equal color on Bidwell\u0027s fount.\n He cupped his hand into the water and pressed it to his face, letting it stream down over his throat and chest. His mind\u0027s fever was cooling and his vision had cleared.\n The Indian village, he\u0027d realized, was a mirror image of Fount Royal. Just like Bidwell\u0027s creation, the village had probably settled here - who could say how long ago - to be so near a water supply.\n Matthew was aware that the crowd\u0027s noise had quietened. a shadow fell over him, and spoke. \"Na unhuh pah ke ne!\"\n Two men grasped Matthew, careful to avoid his injuries, and helped him to his feet. Then Matthew turned toward the speaker, but he knew already who\u0027d given that command.\n Nawpawpay stood four inches shorter than Matthew, but the height of the judicial wig gave the chief the advantage. The waistcoat\u0027s gold stripes glowed in this strong sunlight. add to that the intricate tattoos, and Nawpawpay was an absorbing sight as well as a commanding presence. Rachel stood a few feet behind him, het eyes also the color of Spanish coins.\n \"Forgive my people, \" Nawpawpay said in the tongue of kings. He gave a shrug and a smile. \"We don\u0027t often entertain visitors.\"\n Matthew still felt faint. He blinked slowly and lifted his hand to his face. \"Is... what you\u0027ve done to... Shawcombe... the white fish... part of your entertainmenti\"\n Nawpawpay looked shocked. \"Oh, no! Surely not! You misunderstand, Demon Slayer! You and your woman are honored guests here, for what you\u0027ve done for my people! The white fish was an unclean criminal!\"\n \"You did such to him for murder and thieveryi Couldn\u0027t you finish the task and display some mercyi\"\n Nawpawpay paused, thinking this over. \"Mercyi\" he asked. He frowned. \"What is this mercyi\"\n Evidently it was a concept the French explorer who\u0027d passed himself off as a king had failed to explain. \"Mercy, \" Matthew said, \"is knowing when...\" He hesitated, formulating the rest of it. \"When it is time to put the sufferer out of his misery.\"\n Nawpawpay\u0027s frown deepened. \"Miseryi What is thati\"\n \"How you felt when your father died, \" Matthew answered.\n \"ah! That! You\u0027re saying then the white fish should be slit open and his innards dug out and fed to the dogsi\"\n \"Well... perhaps a knife to the heart would be faster.\"\n \"Faster is not the point, Demon Slayer. The point is to punish, and let all who see know how such crimes are dealt with. also, the children and old people so enjoyed hearing him sing at night.\" Nawpawpay stared at the pond, still deliberating. \"This mercy. This is how things are done in Franz Europayi\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"ah, then. This is something we should seek to emulate. Still... we\u0027ll miss him.\" He turned to a man standing next to him. \"Se oka pa neha! Nu se caido na kay ichisi!\" at the last hissed sound he made a stabbing motion... and, then, to Matthew\u0027s chagrin, a twist and a brutal crosscutting of the invisible blade. The man, who had a face covered with tattoos, ran off hollering and whooping, and most of the onlookers - men, women, and children alike - ran after him making similar noises.\n Matthew should have felt better but he did not. He turned his mind to another and more important subject. \"a courage sun, \" he said. \"What is thati\"\n \"What the water spirit gives, \" Nawpawpay answered. \"also moons and stars from the great gods.\"\n \"The water spiriti\"\n \"Yes.\" Nawpawpay pointed at the pond. \"The water spirit lives there.\"\n \"Matthewi\" Rachel asked, coming to his side. \"What\u0027s he sayingi\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure, \" he told her. \"I\u0027m trying to - \"\n \"ah ah!\" Nawpawpay wagged a finger at him. \"The water spirit might be offended to hear mud words.\"\n \"My apologies. Let me ask this, if I may: how does the water spirit give you these courage sunsi\"\n In answer, Nawpawpay walked into the water. He set off from shore, continuing as the water rose to his thighs. Then Nawpawpay stopped and, steadying the wig on his head with one hand, leaned over and searched the bottom with the other. Every so often he would bring up a handful of mud and sift through it.\n \"What\u0027s he looking fori\" Rachel asked quietly. \"Clamsi\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think so.\" He was tempted to tell her about Shawcombe, if just to relieve himself of what he\u0027d seen, but there was no point in sharing such horror. He watched as Nawpawpay waded to a new location, a little deeper, bent over, and searched again. The front of Woodward\u0027s waistcoat was drenched.\n after another moment, the chief moved to a third location. Rachel slipped her hand into Matthew\u0027s. \"I\u0027ve never seen the like of this place. There\u0027s a wall of trees around the whole village.\"\n Matthew grunted, watching Nawpawpay at work. The protective wall of trees, he thought, was a further link between the village and Fount Royal. He had a feeling that the two towns, untold miles apart, were also linked in a way that no one would ever have suspected.\n The nearness of her and the warmth of her hand put their lovemaking in mind. as if it were ever really a stone\u0027s toss from the center of his memory. But it had all been an illusion. Hadn\u0027t iti Of course it had been. Rachel would not have climbed up on a pallet to give herself to a dying man. Not even if he had saved her life. Not even if she had thought he was not much longer for this earth.\n But... just a speculation... what if by then it was known he was on the road to recoveryi and what if... the doctor had actually encouraged such physical and emotional contact, as an Indian method of healing akin to... well... akin to bloodlettingi\n If that were so, Dr. Shields had a lot to learn.\n \"Racheli\" Matthew said, his fingers gently caressing her hand. \"Did you...\" He stopped, not knowing how to approach this. He decided on a roundabout method. \"Have you been given any other clothes to weari any... uh... native clothingi\"\n She met his gaze. \"Yes, \" she said. \"That silent girl brought me a garment, in exchange for the blue dress that was in your bag.\"\n Matthew paused, trying to read her eyes. If he and Rachel had actually made love, her admittance of it was not forthcoming. Neither was it readable in her countenance. and here, he thought, was the crux of the matter: she might have given het body to him, as a gesture of feeling or as some healing method devised by the doctor, who sounded to Matthew to be cut from Exodus Jerusalem\u0027s cloth; or it might have been a wishful fantasy induced by fever and drugged smoke.\n Which was the truthi The truth, he thought, was that Rachel still loved her husband. Or, at least, the memory of him. He could see that, by what she would not say. If indeed there was something to be said. She might hold a feeling for him, Matthew thought, like a bouquet of pink carnations. But they were not red roses, and that made all the difference.\n He might ask what color the garment was. He might describe it for her exactly. Or he might start to describe it, and she tell him he could not be more wrong.\n Perhaps he didn\u0027t need to know. Or wish to know, really. Perhaps things were best left unspoken, and the boundary between reality and fantasy left to run its straight and undisturbed course.\n He cleared his throat and looked toward the pond again. \"I recall you told me we\u0027d travelled an hour after the Indians came. Do you know in which directioni\"\n \"The sun was on our left for a while. Then at our backs.\"\n He nodded. They must have travelled an hour\u0027s distance back toward Fount Royal. Nawpawpay moved to a fourth location, and called out, \"The water spirit is a trickster! Sometimes he gives them freely, other times we must search and search to find one!\" Then, with a child\u0027s grin, he returned to his work.\n \"It\u0027s amazing!\" Rachel said, shaking her head. \"absolutely amazing!\"\n \"What isi\"\n \"That he should speak French, and you can understand him! I wouldn\u0027t be more surprised if he should know Latin!\"\n \"Yes, he is a remarkable - \" He stopped abruptly, as if a wall of rough stones had crashed down upon him. \"My God, \" he whispered. \"That\u0027s it!\"\n \"Whati\"\n \"No Latin.\" Matthew\u0027s face had flushed with excitement. \"What Reverend Grove said to Mrs. Nettles, in Bidwell\u0027s parlor. \u0027No Latin. \u0027 That\u0027s the key!\"\n \"The keyi To whati\"\n He looked at her, and now his grin was childlike too. \"The key to proving you innocent! It\u0027s the proof I\u0027ve been needing, Rachel! It was right there, as close as...\" He struggled for an analogy, and touched his grizzled chin. \"Whiskers! The cunning fox can\u0027t - \"\n \"ah!\" Nawpawpay\u0027s hand lifted, muddy to the wrist. \"Here is a find!\" Matthew waded into the water to meet him. The chief opened his hand and displayed a single silver pearl. It wasn\u0027t much but, coupled with the fragment of pie dish, was enough.\n Matthew was curious about something, and he waded on past the chief until the water neared his waist.\n and there! His suspicion was confirmed; he felt a definite current swirling around his knees. \"The water moves, \" he said.\n \"ah, yes, \" Nawpawpay agreed. \"It is the breathing of the spirit. Sometimes more, sometimes less. But always, it breathes. You find interest in the water spiriti\"\n \"Yes, very much.\"\n \"Hm.\" He nodded. \"I didn\u0027t know your kind was religious. I shall take you to the house of the spirits, as an honored guest.\"\n Nawpawpay led Matthew and Rachel to another hut near the pond. This one had walls daubed with blue dye, its entrance cloaked by a fantastically woven curtain of turkey and pigeon feathers, rabbit fur, fox skins with the heads still attached, and various other animal hides. \"alas, \" Nawpawpay said, \"your woman can\u0027t have entrance here. The spirits deign only to speak to men, and to women through men. Unless, of course, the woman was born with the spirit marks and becomes a seer.\"\n Matthew nodded. It had occurred to him that one culture\u0027s \"spirit marks\" were another culture\u0027s \"marks of the devil.\" He told Rachel that the chief\u0027s custom required her to wait while they went inside. Then he followed Nawpawpay.\n The interior was very dim, only one flame burning in a small clay pot full of oil. Thankfully, though, there was no eye-searing smoke. The house of the spirits appeared empty, as far as Matthew could tell.\n \"We speak respectfully here, \" Nawpawpay said. \"My father built this, many passings of seasons ago. I often come here, to ask his advice.\"\n \"and he answersi\"\n \"Well... no. But then again, he does. He listens to my problem, and then his answer is always: Son, decide for yourself.\" Nawpawpay picked up the clay pot. \"Here are the gifts the water spirit gives.\" He followed the flickering flame deeper into the hut, with Matthew a few paces behind.\n Still, there was nothing. Except one thing. On the floor was a larger bowl full of muddy water. Nawpawpay reached into it with the same hand that held the pearl, and then his hand reappeared muddy and dripping. \"We honor the water spirit in this way, \" he said. as Matthew watched, Nawpawpay approached a wall. It was not pinewood, as the others were, but was thickly plastered with dried brown mud from the pond.\n Nawpawpay pressed his handful of mud and the pearl into the wall and smoothed it down. \"I must speak to the spirit now, \" he said. and then, in a soft singsong chant, \"Pa ne sa nehra cai ke panu. Ke na pe pe kairu.\" as he chanted, he moved the flame back and forth along the mud-caked wall.\n There was a red glint, first. Then a blue one.\n Then... red... gold... more gold, a dozen gold... and silver... and purple and...\n ... a silent explosion of colors as the light moved back and forth along the wall: emerald green, ruby crimson, sapphire blue... and gold, gold, a thousand times gold...\n \"Oh, \" Matthew gasped, as the hairs stood up on the back of his neck.\n Held in that wall was the treasure.\n a pirate\u0027s fortune. Jewels by the hundreds - sky blue, deep green, pale amber, dazzling white - and the coins, gold and silver enough to make the king of Franz Europay gibber and drool. and the most stunning thing was that Matthew realized he was seeing only the outermost layer. The plastering of dried mud had to be at least four inches thick, six feet tall, and four feet wide.\n Here it was. In this dirt wall, in this hut, in this village, in this wilderness. Matthew wasn\u0027t sure, but he thought he could hear God and the Devil joined together in common laughter.\n He knew. What was put into the spring at Fount Royal was carried out by the current of an underground river. It might take time, of course. Everything took time. The entrance to that river, there somewhere in the depths of Bidwell\u0027s spring, might only be the diameter of Lucretia Vaughan\u0027s pie plate. If a pirate had taken a sounding of the fount before lowering bags of jewels and coins, he would have found a bottom at forty feet - but he would not have found the hole that eventually pulled everything into the subterranean flow. Perhaps the current drew more powerfully in a particular season, or was affected by the moon just as were the ocean\u0027s tides. In any case, the pirate - most probably a man who was only smart enough to loot vessels, but not to vessel his loot in a sturdy container - had chosen a vault that suffered the flaw of a funnel at its bottom.\n Spellbound, Matthew approached the wall. \"Se na caira pa pa kairu, \" chanted Nawpawpay, as he slowly moved the flame back and forth and the small sharp glints and explosions of reflected light continued.\n Matthew saw in another moment that the dried mud also held bits of pottery, gold chains, silver spoons, and so forth. Here the gold-encrusted hilt of a knife protruded, and there was the cracked face of a pocket watch.\n It made sense that Lucretia Vaughan\u0027s pie dish would go to the doctor, as some sort of enchanted implement sent from the water spirit. after all, it was decorated with a pattern that they most likely had figured out was a human organ.\n \"Na pe huida na pe caida, \" Nawpawpay said, and that seemed to finish it, as he held the flame toward Matthew.\n \"The courage - \" Matthew\u0027s voice cracked. He tried again. \"The courage suns. You say the white fish stole onei\"\n \"Yes, and murdered the man to whom it was given.\"\n \"May I ask why it was given to this mani\"\n \"as a reward, \" Nawpawpay said, \"for courage. This man saved another who was gored by a wild tusked pig, and afterward killed the pig. It\u0027s a tradition my father began. But that white fish has been luring my people with his bad ways, making them sick in the mind with strong drink, and then making them work for him like common dogs. It was time for him to go.\"\n \"I see.\" Matthew recalled that Shawcombe had said his tavern had been built with Indian labor. and now he really did see. He saw the whole picture, and how it fit together in an intricate pattern.\n \"Nawpawpay, \" Matthew said, \"my... uh... woman and I must leave this place. Today. We have to go back from where we came. Do you know the village near the seai\"\n \"Of course I do. We watch it all the time.\" Nawpawpay wore an expression of concern. \"But Demon Slayer, you can\u0027t leave today! You\u0027re still too weak to travel that distance. You must tell me what you know of Franz Europay, and I also have a celebration planned for you tonight. Dancing and feasting. and we have the demon\u0027s head, carved out for you to wear.\"\n \"Urn... well... I - \"\n \"In the morning you may leave, if you still desire to. Tonight we celebrate, to honor your courage and the death of that beast.\" He directed the light to the treasure wall again. \"Here, Demon Slayer! a gift for you, as is proper. Take one thing you see that shines strong enough to guide your hand.\"\n It was astounding, Matthew thought. Nawpawpay didn\u0027t realize - and God protect him from ever finding out - that there were those in the outside world, the civilized world, who would come through the forest to this place and raze it to the ground to obtain one square foot of dirt from that wall.\n But a gift of fantastic worth had been offered, and Matthew\u0027s hand was so guided. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-41.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \n Judgment of the Witch \n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
