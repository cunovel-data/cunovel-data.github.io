{"id":85916,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"aND NOW THE WHOLE WORLD was silent. Or at least it seemed so, to Matthew\u0027s ears. In fact, the world was so silent that the sound of his feet creeping on the hallway\u0027s floorboards sounded to him like barely muffled cannonades, and the errant squeak of a loose timber like a high-pitched human shriek.\\n\\n He had a lantern in hand. He was dressed in his bedclothes, as he had retired to sleep several hours ago. In reality, though, he had retired to ponder and wait. The time had arrived, and he was on a journey to Bidwell\u0027s upstairs study.\\n\\n It was now the Sabbath morning. He reasoned it was sometime between midnight and two o\u0027clock. The previous day had truly been nightmarish, and this current day promised to be no less an ordeal.\\n\\n Matthew had himself seen eight more wagons departing Fount Royal. The gate had been opened and closed with a regularity that would have been comical had it not been so tragic. Bidwell had remained in his bedchamber all day. Winston had gone in to see him, as had Dr. Shields, and once Matthew had heard Bidwell\u0027s voice raving and raging with a frightful intensity that made one believe all the demons of Hell had ringed his bed to pay their ghastly respects. Perhaps in Bidwell\u0027s tortured mind they had.\\n\\n During the course of the day Matthew had sat at the magistrate\u0027s bedside for several hours, reading the book on English plays and attempting to keep his mind from wandering to the Florida country. He was also there to guard against the magistrate finding out what had occurred this morning, as it might cause Woodward deep grief that would sink him again into sickness. The magistrate, though certainly able to communicate more clearly and feeling positive about his chances of improvement, was yet weak and in need of further rest. Dr. Shields had administered three more doses of the powerful medicine, but had been wise enough during his visits not to mention anything that could harm his patient\u0027s outlook. The medicine did what it was meant to do: it sent Woodward to the dreamer\u0027s land, where he could not know what tumult was taking place in reality.\\n\\n Fortunately, the magistrate had been asleep - or, rather, drugged - when Bidwell had carried out his raging. In the evening, as darkness called upon Fount Royal and many fewer lamps answered than the night before, Matthew had asked Mrs. Nettles for a deck of cards and played a dozen or so games of five and forty with the magistrate, who was delighted at the chance to challenge his sluggish mind. as they played, Matthew made mention of Woodward\u0027s dream of Oxford, and how Johnstone had also seemed to enjoy the recollections.\\n\\n \"Yes, \" Woodward had said, studying his cards. \"Once an Oxford man... always so.\"\\n\\n \"Hm.\" Matthew had decided to let another hand go by before he mentioned the schoolmaster again. \"It is a shame about Mr. Johnstone\u0027s knee. Being so deformed. But he does get around well, doesn\u0027t hei\"\\n\\n a slight smile had crept across the magistrate\u0027s mouth. \"Matthew, Matthew, \" he\u0027d said. \"Do you never quiti\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, siri\"\\n\\n \"Please. I am not... so ill and... weak-minded that I can\u0027t see through you. What is this now... about his kneei\"\\n\\n \"Nothing, sir. I was just making mention of it, in passing. You did say you saw it, did you noti\"\\n\\n \"I did.\"\\n\\n \"at close quartersi\"\\n\\n \"Close enough. I could smell nothing... because of my condition... but I recall that Mr. Winston was... quite repelled... by the odor of Mr. Johnstone\u0027s hogsfat liniment.\"\\n\\n \"But you did clearly view the deformityi\"\\n\\n \"Yes, \" Woodward had said. \"Clearly, and... it was a viewing... I would not care to repeat. Now... may we return to our gamei\"\\n\\n Not long after that, Dr. Shields had arrived with the magistrate\u0027s third dose of the day, and Woodward had been sleeping calmly ever since.\\n\\n Matthew had, in the afternoon, taken the opportunity for a quick look into Bidwell\u0027s study, so now in the middle of the night he had no problem getting inside. He closed the door behind him and crossed the gold-and-red Persian rug to the large mahogany desk that commanded the room. He sat down in the desk\u0027s chair and quietly pulled open the topmost drawer. He found no map there, so he went on to the next drawer. a careful search through papers, wax seals with the scrolled letter B, official-looking documents and the like revealed no map. Neither did the third drawer, nor the fourth and final one.\\n\\n Matthew stood up, taking his lantern to the study\u0027s bookshelves. On the way, the squeal of a loose pinewood floorboard made his flesh crawl. Then he began to methodically move all the leatherbound books one from another, thinking that perhaps the map might be folded up and stored between two of them. Of course, the map might also be folded up inside one of the books, which was going to necessitate a longer search than he\u0027d anticipated.\\n\\n He was perhaps near midway in his route through the bookshelves when he heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs. He hesitated, listening more intently. The footsteps reached the top of the stairs and also hesitated. There was a space of time in which neither Matthew nor the person in the hallway moved. Then he heard the footsteps approaching and he saw lantern light in the space between door and floorboards.\\n\\n Quickly he opened the glass of his own lamp and blew out the flame. He retreated to the protection of the desk and crouched down on the floor.\\n\\n The door opened. Someone entered, paused for a few seconds, and then the door was closed again. Matthew could see the ruddy glow of the person\u0027s lantern upon the walls as it moved from side to side. and then the voice came, but cast low so as not to leave the room: \"Mr. Corbett, I know ye just blew out a candle. I can smell it. If you\u0027d show y\u0027self, pleasei\"\\n\\n He stood up and Mrs. Nettles centered her lamplight on him. \"Ye mi\u0027 care to know that my own quarters are \u0027neath this room, \" she said. \"I heard someone walkin\u0027 and \u0027sumed it must be Mr. Bidwell, as this is his private study.\"\\n\\n \"Pardon me, I didn\u0027t mean to wake you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you didn\u0027t, but I was already waked. I was plan-nin\u0027 on comin\u0027 up and lookin\u0027 in on \u0027im, since he was in such an awful bad way.\" She approached him and set the lantern down on the desktop. She wore a somber gray nightcap and a nightgown of similar hue, and on her face was a smoothing of ghastly green-tinted skin cream. Matthew had to believe that if Bidwell saw Mrs. Nettles in this state, he might think a froggish phantasm had crawled from its Hellish swamp. \"Your intrusion in this room, \" she said sternly, \"canna\u0027 be excused. What\u0027re you doin\u0027 in herei\"\\n\\n There was nothing to be done but tell the truth. \"I understand from Solomon Stiles that Bidwell has a map of the Florida country, drawn by a French explorer. I thought it might be hidden in this room, either in his desk or on the bookshelves.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Nettles made no reply, but simply stared holes through him. \"I am not saying I\u0027ve decided, \" Matthew continued. \"I\u0027m only saying I wish to see the map, to gain some idea of what the terrain is like.\"\\n\\n \"It would kill you, \" she said. \"and the lady too. Does she know what you\u0027re wantin\u0027i\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ye think askin\u0027 her oughta be the first thing, a\u0027fore ye start the plannin\u0027i\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not planning. I\u0027m only looking.\"\\n\\n \"Plannin\", lookin\u0027... whate\u0027er. Mi\u0027 be she doesn\u0027t care ta perish in the jaws of a wild beast.\"\\n\\n \"What, theni She\u0027d rather perish by burningi I think not!\"\\n\\n \"Keep your voice reined, \" she warned. \"Mr. Bidwell mi\u0027 be mind-sick, but he\u0027s nae ear-deef.\"\\n\\n \"all right. But... if I were to continue my search for this map... would you leave the room and forget you saw me herei This is my business and my business alone.\"\\n\\n \"Nae, you\u0027re wrong. It\u0027s my business too, for it was my urgin\u0027 brought you into this. If I\u0027d kept my tongue still, then - \"\\n\\n \"Pardon, \" Matthew interrupted, \"but I must disagree. Your urging, as you put it, simply alerted me to consider that not all was as it seemed in this town. Which, whether you realize it or not, was a grand understatement. I would have had serious doubts as to Rachel\u0027s being a witch even if you had been one of the witnesses against her.\"\\n\\n \"Well then, if her innocence is all so clear to you, why canna\u0027 the magistrate see iti\"\\n\\n \"a complicated question, \" he said. \"The answer involves age and life experience... both of which, in this case, seem to be liabilities to cleat thinking. Or rather, I should say, liabilities to thinking beyond the straight furrow in a crooked field, which you so elegantly pointed out on our first meeting. Now: Will you allow me to search for the mapi\"\\n\\n \"Nae, \" she answered. \"If you\u0027re so all-fired to find it, I\u0027ll point it out.\" She picked up the lantern and directed its glow to the wall behind the desk. \"There it hangs.\"\\n\\n Matthew looked. Indeed on the wall hung a brown parchment map, stretched by a wooden frame. It was about fifteen inches or so across and ten inches deep, and it was positioned between an oil portrait of a sailing ship and a charcoal drawing of what appeared to be the London dockside. \"Oh, \" he said sheepishly. \"Well... my thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Best make sure it\u0027s what you\u0027re needin\u0027. I know it\u0027s French, but I\u0027ve never paid much mind to it.\" She offered him the lantern.\\n\\n Matthew found in another moment that it was indeed what he was needing. It actually appeared to be part of a larger map, and displayed the country from perhaps thirty miles north of Fount Royal to the area identified, in faded quill pen, as Le Terre Florida. Between Fount Royal and the Spanish territory the ancient quill had drawn a representation of vast forest, broken here and there by clearings, the meandering of rivers, and a number of lakes. It was a fanciful map, however, as one lake displayed a kraken-like creature and was named by the mapmaker Le Lac de Poisson Monstre. The swamp - identified with symbols of grass and water instead of tree symbols- - that stretched along the coastline all the way from Fount Royal to the Florida country was titled Marais Perfide. and there was an area of swamp in the midst of the forest, some fifty or sixty miles southwest of Fount Royal, that was named Le Terre de Brutalitie.\\n\\n \"Is it he\u0027pful to yei\" Mrs. Nettles asked.\\n\\n \"More daunting than helpful, \" Matthew said. \"But yes, it does do some good.\" He had seen what looked to be a clearing in the wilderness ten or twelve miles southwest of Fount Royal that stretched for what might have been - by the strange and skewed dimensions of this map - four miles in length. another clearing of several miles lay to the south of the first, and in this one was a lake. a third, the largest of the three, was reachable to the southwest. They were like the footprints of some primordial giant, and Matthew thought that if indeed those cleared areas - or at least areas where the wilderness was not so perfide - existed, then they constituted the route of least resistance to the Florida country. Perhaps this was also the \"most direct route\" Solomon Stiles had mentioned. In any case, it appeared somewhat less tasking than day after day of negotiating unbroken woodland. Matthew also noted the small scratchings of Indieni at three widely separate locations, the nearest being twenty miles or so southwest of Fount Royal. He assumed the question mark indicated a possible sighting of either a live Indian, the discovery of an artifact, or even the sound of tribal drums.\\n\\n It was not going to be easy. In fact, it would be woefully hard.\\n\\n Could the Florida country be reachedi Yes, it could. By the directions of southwest, south, southwest and the linking together of those less-wooded giant\u0027s footprints. But, as he had previously considered, he was certainly no leatherstocking and the merest miscalculation of the sun\u0027s angle might lead him and Rachel into the Terre Brutalitie.\\n\\n Then again, all of it was terre brutalitie, was it noti\\n\\n It was insane! he thought as the frustration of reality hit him. absolutely insane! How could he have ever imagined doing such a thingi To be lost in those terrible forests would be death a thousand times over!\\n\\n He handed the lantern back to Mrs. Nettles. \"Thank you, \" he said, and he heard the defeated resignation in his voice.\\n\\n \"aye, \" she said as she took the lamp, \"it does seem a beast.\"\\n\\n \"Mote than a beast. It seems impossible.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re puttin\u0027 it out of mind, theni\"\\n\\n He ran a hand across his brow. \"What am I to do, Mrs. Nettlesi Can you possibly tell mei\"\\n\\n She shook her head, looking at him with saddened compassion. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I canna\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"No one can, \" he said wearily. \"No one, except myself. The saying may be that no man is an island... but I feel very much like at least a solitary dominion. Rachel will be led to the stake within thirty hours. I know she is innocent, yet I can do nothing to free her. Therefore... what am I to do, except devise outlandish schemes to teach the Florida countryi\"\\n\\n \"You are ta forget her, \" Mrs. Nettles said. \"You are ta go on about your own life, and let the dead be dead.\"\\n\\n \"That is the sensible response. But part of me will die on Monday morning too. The part that believes in justice. When that dies, Mrs. Nettles, I shall never be worth a damn again.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll recover. Ever\u0027one goes on, as they must.\"\\n\\n \"Everyone goes on, \" he repeated, with a taint of bitter mockery. \"Oh, yes. They go on. With crippled spirits and broken ideals, they do go on. and with the passage of years they forget what crippled and broke them. They accept it grandly as they grow older, as if crippling and breaking were gifts from a king. Then those same hopeful spirits and large ideals in younger souls are viewed as stupid, and petty... and things to be crippled and broken, because everyone does go on.\" He looked into the woman\u0027s eyes. \"Tell me. What is the point of life, if truth is not worth standing up fori If justice is a hollow shelli If beauty and grace are burnt to ashes, and evil rejoices in the flamesi Shall I weep on that day, and lose my mind, or join the rejoicing and lose my souli Shall I sit in my roomi Should I go for a long walk, but where might I go so as not to smell the smokei Should I just go on, Mrs. Nettles, like everyone elsei\"\\n\\n \"I think, \" she said grimly, \"that you do nae have a choice.\" He had no response for this, which by its iron truth crushed him.\\n\\n Mrs. Nettles sighed, her face downcast and her shadow thrown huge by the lamplight. \"Go ta bed, sir, \" she said. \"There\u0027s nae any more can be done.\"\\n\\n He nodded, retrieved his dark lantern, and took the first two steps to the door, then hesitated. \"You know... I really thought, for a brief while at least, that I might be able to do it. That I might be able, if I dared hard enough.\"\\n\\n \"Ta do what, siri\"\\n\\n \"To be Rachel\u0027s champion, \" he said wistfully. \"and when Solomon Stiles told me about the two slaves who\u0027d escaped - the brother and sister - and that they\u0027d nearly reached the Florida country... I thought... it i possible. But it\u0027s not, is iti and it never was. Well. I do need to get to bed, don\u0027t Ii\" He felt as if he could sleep for a year, and awaken bearded and forgetful of time. \"Good night. Of rather... good morning.\"\\n\\n \"The brother and sisteri\" Mrs. Nettles said, with a perplexed expression. \"You mean... the two slaves who ran away... oh, I s\u0027pose it must\u0027a been the verra first year.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. Stiles told me it was the first year.\"\\n\\n \"Those two got near ta the Florida countryi Mr. Corbett, they were but children!\"\\n\\n \"Childreni\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir. Oakley Reeves and his sister, Dulcine. I recall they ran away after their mother died. She was a cook. The boy was all of thirteen, sir, and the girl no older\u0027n twelve.\"\\n\\n \"Whati But... Stiles told me they were put in irons. I assumed they were adults!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, they were held in irons, even though the boy was lamed. They were both put on a wagon and taken away. I knew they\u0027d run a piece, but I had nae an idea they\u0027d gotten so far.\"\\n\\n \"Children, \" Matthew repeated. He blinked, stunned by this revelation. \"My God. If two children could make it that distance...\" He took the lantern from her hand and again studied the French explorer\u0027s map, this time with a silent intensity that spoke volumes.\\n\\n \"They were desperate, \" Mrs. Nettles said.\\n\\n \"No mote so than I.\"\\n\\n \"They cared nae if they lived or died.\"\\n\\n \"I care that Rachel lives. and myself as well.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure they had someone helpin\u0027 \u0027em. an older slave, gatherin\u0027 what they needed.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, \" Matthew said. \"They probably did.\" He turned toward her, his eyes glittering with fierce resolve. \"Would you perform such a function for me, Mrs. Nettlesi\"\\n\\n \"Nae, I wouldn\u0027t!\" she answered. \"I\u0027m dead set against it!\"\\n\\n \"all right, then. Would you betray me if I myself gathered the necessary itemsi Some of them would be matches and a flint, a knife, clothing and shoes both for myself and Rachel, and a supply of food. I would have to take those items from the household.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Nettles did not reply. She scowled, her froggishly green face nothing short of fearsome.\\n\\n \"I ask only of you what you once asked of me, \" he said.\\n\\n \"The Lord my witness, I canna\u0027 bear ta see ye go on such a folly and lose your young life. and what of the magistratei Would you abandon himi\"\\n\\n \"I thank the same Lord who is your witness that Magistrate Woodward is on the path to recovery. There is nothing I can do to speed his progress.\"\\n\\n \"But leavin\u0027 him like this can ruin it. Have you thought on thati\"\\n\\n \"I have. It is a bitter choice to have to make, between the magistrate and Rachel. But that\u0027s where I find myself. I intend on writing a letter to him, explaining everything. I must hope that he reads that letter and fully understands my reasoning. If not... then not. But I hope - I believe - the magistrate will.\"\\n\\n \"Your time. It\u0027s awful wee.\"\\n\\n \"Everything would have to be gathered and readied within twenty-four hours. I want to get her out of there and be gone long before sunrise.\"\\n\\n \"This is daft!\" she said. \"How do ye plan on gettin\u0027 that key from Greeni He won\u0027t likely open up the door and let you march in and out!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have to give that some thought.\"\\n\\n \"and how will you go, theni Right through the front gatei\"\\n\\n \"No, \" Matthew said. \"Through the swamp, the same as the slaves.\"\\n\\n \"Ha! If ye make five miles, you\u0027ll have the luck of angus Mc-Coody!\"\\n\\n \"I have no idea who that might be, but I presume it\u0027s some personage of fortune in your native land. If it\u0027s a blessing, I accept it.\" He had put his own darkened lantern on the desk and was measuring with the fingers of his free hand the distances involved. \"I must have a compass, \" he decided. \"I\u0027ll never find the way without one.\" a thought came to him. \"I would wager Paine owned a compass. I don\u0027t think he would mind if I searched his house. alas, Mrs. Nettles, I shall also have to free this map from its prison.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell me such a thing. I don\u0027t care ta know.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll leave it alone for the time being. There\u0027s no point in advertising my intentions.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll be after you, \" she said. \"Most likely Mr. Stiles, leadin\u0027 the way. They\u0027ll hunt ye down quick enough.\"\\n\\n \"Why should theyi Rachel and I have no value to Bidwell. In fact, he may be more pleased to see the last of me than of her. I think he\u0027ll send Stiles out to make a quick search, but it will be only rudimentary.\"\\n\\n \"I say you\u0027re mistaken. Mr. Bidwell wants ever\u0027one here ta see her burn.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt there will be many remaining to watch the display.\" Matthew removed the candle from his lantern and lit it with hers. Then he returned the lamp to her hand. \"after I get Rachel there - to a place of safety, a town or fort or some such - and come back, I\u0027ll explain everything to him.\"\\n\\n \"Hold.\" Mrs. Nettles regarded him now as if his bell was severely cracked. \"What\u0027re you sayin\u0027i Come backi\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s correct. I\u0027m taking Rachel to the Florida country, but I don\u0027t intend to stay. If I can follow the map and compass there, I can follow them back.\"\\n\\n \"You young fool! They won\u0027t let you come back! No, sirrah! Once those Spaniards get their claws on you - an English citizen - they\u0027ll ship you right quick ta their own damned land! Oh, they\u0027ll treat Rachel fair enough, her bein\u0027 a Portuguese, but you they\u0027ll parade through their streets like a dancin\u0027 monkey!\"\\n\\n \"Not if they don\u0027t get their claws - as you put it - on me. I said I would take Rachel to some town or fort, but I didn\u0027t say I myself would enter it. Oh... one more thing I need to find: a stick, line, and hook I might use for fishing.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a city boy, \" she said, shaking het head. \"What do ye know of fishin\u0027i Well, that wilderness will cure your insanity soon enough. God help you and that poor woman, and bless your bones when they\u0027re a-layin\u0027 in a beast\u0027s lair chewed ta the marra!\"\\n\\n \"a delightful image to sleep upon, Mrs. Nettles. and now I must leave your company, as my day will surely be full.\" He took his lantern and went to the door, treading lightly.\\n\\n \"a moment, \" she said. She stared at the floor, a muscle working in her jaw. \"If ye haven\u0027t yet considered this... you mi\u0027 think to fetch some clothes and the like from her house. all her belonging are still in there, I believe. If you\u0027re wantin\u0027 an extra pair a\u0027 boots... I mi\u0027 can he\u0027p you with that.\"\\n\\n \"any help would be greatly appreciated.\"\\n\\n She looked up sharply at him. \"Sleep on this, and think on it again with a clear mind. Hear mei\"\\n\\n \"I do. and thank you.\"\\n\\n \"You ought ta curse me, and thank me only if I put a pan ta the side of your head!\"\\n\\n \"That makes me think of breakfast. Would you awaken me promptly at six o\u0027clocki and grant me an extra helping of baconi\"\\n\\n \"Yes, \" she said glumly. \"Sir.\"\\n\\n Matthew left the room and went to his own. He got into bed, extinguished the lantern, and lay on his back in the dark. He heard Mrs. Nettles go along the hallway to Bidwell\u0027s room and quietly open the door. There was a period of quiet, during which Matthew could envision the woman lifting her light to check on her sleeping - -and near-mad- - master. Then he heard her walk back along the hall and descend the stairs, after which all was silent again.\\n\\n He had less than four hours to sleep, so he ought to get to it. There was indeed much to do on the morrow, most of it not only duplicitous but highly dangerous.\\n\\n How was that key to be gotten from Greeni Possibly something would come to him. He hoped. It was vital to find a compass. and clothes and proper shoes for Rachel, as well. Then food must be procured; preferably dried beef, though if it was heavily salted the need for water would increase. He had to write a letter to the magistrate, and that might be the most difficult task of all.\\n\\n \"My God, \" he whispered. \"What am I about to doi\"\\n\\n at least a hundred and forty miles. On foot. Through a land cruel and treacherous, following a path of least resistance mapped out by a long-dead hand. Down to the Florida country, where he would set his nightbird free. and then back again, alonei\\n\\n Mrs. Nettles was right. He didn\u0027t know a damn thing about fishing.\\n\\n But he had once survived by his wits for four months at the harbor of Manhattan. He had fought for crumbs, stolen, and scavenged in that urban wilderness. He had endured all manner of hardships, because he had to. The same was true of his trek with the magistrate through the wet woods and across the sodden earth from Shawcombe\u0027s tavern. He had kept the magistrate going, when Woodward had wanted to quit and sit down in the muck. and Matthew had done that because he had to.\\n\\n Two children had nearly made the Florida country. and might have, had not the eldest broken his ankle.\\n\\n It was possible. It had to be possible. There was no other answer.\\n\\n But the question remained in his mind, and it disturbed him so much that sleep became more elusive: What am I about to doi\\n\\n He turned over on his side, curling up like an infant about to be expelled from a womb into the hard reality of life. He was afraid to the very marrow of those bones that Mrs. Nettles predicted would be chewed in a beast\u0027s lair. He was afraid, and hot tears born of that fear burned his eyes but he wiped them away before they spilled. He was no champion, no leatherstocking, and no fisherman.\\n\\n But, by God, he was a survivor, and he intended for Rachel to survive as well.\\n\\n It was possible. It was. It was. It was. It was.\\n\\n He would say that to himself a hundred times, but at the rising of the sun and the first cock\u0027s crow he would be no less afraid than he was in this merciless dark. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-36.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \\n Judgment of the Witch \\n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
