That afflicted blood\u0027s got to be rid of.\"\\n\\n \"I hope you\u0027re right. I\u0027m not sure his condition isn\u0027t being hastened by all this bleeding.\" He started to slide past her up the stairs, which was a precarious maneuver due to her formidable size and the lack of a railing.\\n\\n \"Just a moment, sir!\" she said. \"You have a visitor.\"\\n\\n \"a visitori Whoi\"\\n\\n \"The child, \" she said. \"Violet adams. She\u0027s in the library, waitin\u0027 for you.\"\\n\\n \"Ohi\" Matthew instantly went back down the stairs and entered the library. His quick entrance startled the little girl, who was standing before the open window studying a bishop she had picked up from the chessboard. She jumped and backed away from him like a cornered deer.\\n\\n \"Forgive me, \" Matthew said in a calming tone. He showed one palm in a non-threatening gesture, while he held the rolled-up decree at his side. \"I should have announced myself.\"\\n\\n She just stared at him, her body rigid as if she might either decide to flee past him or leap through the window. On this occasion she definitely was not groomed for a court appearance. Her light brown hair was loose about her shoulders and in need of washing, her tan-and-red-checked shift was held together with patches, and her shoes were near worn through.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been waiting for mei\" Matthew asked. She nodded. \"I presume this is not an errand on behalf of your father and motheri\"\\n\\n \"No sir, \" she answered. \"They sent me to fetch some water.\" Matthew looked down and saw two empty buckets on the floor. \"I see. But you decided to come here firsti\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\"\\n\\n \"For what reasoni\"\\n\\n Violet carefully placed the chesspiece back in its proper place on the board. \"What are these, siri are they toysi\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a game called chess. The pieces have different patterns of movement across the board.\"\\n\\n \"Ohhhh.\" She seemed much impressed. \"Like knuckles \u0027n\u0027 stones, \u0027ceptin\u0027 you play that in the dirt.\"\\n\\n \"I imagine so, yes.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re pretty, \" she said. \"Did Mr. Bidwell carve \u0027emi\"\\n\\n \"I doubt it.\"\\n\\n She continued staring at the chessboard. The tic of her upper lip had returned. \"Last night, \" she said, \"a rat got in my bed.\" Matthew didn\u0027t quite know how to respond to this matter-of-fact statement, so he said nothing.\\n\\n \"It got all tangled up in the beddin\u0027s, \" she went on. \"It couldn\u0027t get out, and I could feel it down at my feet, thrashin\u0027. I couldn\u0027t get loose, neither. Both of us were tryin\u0027 to get out. Then my papa come in and I was scared I was gonna get bit so I was screamin\u0027. So he grabbed it up in the sheet and hit it with a candlestick, and then my mama started screamin\u0027 \u0027cause there was blood everywhere and that sheet was ruined.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, \" Matthew said. \"It must have been traumatic.\" Especially for a child of her sensitive nature, he might have added.\\n\\n \"Trau - what, siri\"\\n\\n \"I meant it must have been a fearsome experience.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\" She nodded, and now she picked up a pawn and studied it in the sunlight. \"The thing about it, though... is that... near mornin\u0027, I started rememberin\u0027 somethin\u0027. about that man\u0027s voice I heard singin\u0027 in the Hamilton house.\"\\n\\n Matthew\u0027s heart suddenly lodged in his throat. \"Remembering whati\"\\n\\n \"Whose voice it was.\" She put down the pawn and lifted her eyes to his. \"It\u0027s still a fog... and thinkin\u0027 about it makes my head hurt somethin\u0027 awful, but... I recollected what he was sin-gin\u0027.\" She took a breath and began to softly sing, in a sweet and clear timbre: \"Come out, come out, my dames and dandies. Come out, come out, and taste my candies...\"\\n\\n \"The ratcatcher, \" Matthew said. In his mind he heard Linch singing that same macabre song during the massacre of rats at the gaol.\\n\\n \"Yes sir. It was Mr. Linch\u0027s voice I heard, from that room back there.\"\\n\\n Matthew stared intensely into the child\u0027s eyes. \"Tell me this, Violet: how did you know it was Linch\u0027s voicei Had you ever heard that song beforei\"\\n\\n \"One time he come to kill a nest of rats my papa found. They were all big ones, and black as night. Mr. Linch came and brought his potions and his sticker, and that was what he was singin\u0027 when he was waitin\u0027 for the rats to get drunk.\"\\n\\n \"Did you tell anyone else about thisi Your mother and fatheri\"\\n\\n \"No sir. They don\u0027t like for me to talk of it.\"\\n\\n \"Then you shouldn\u0027t tell them you\u0027ve been here to see me, either.\"\\n\\n \"No sir, I wouldn\u0027t dare. I\u0027d get a terrible whippin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"You ought to get your water and go home, then, \" Matthew said. \"But one more thing: when you entered the Hamilton house, do you remember smelling anythingi Like a very bad odori\" He was thinking of the decaying carcass. \"Or did you see or hear a dogi\"\\n\\n Violet shook her head. \"No sir, none of that. Whyi\"\\n\\n \"Well...\" Matthew reached down to the chessboard and traded positions between the king\u0027s knight and the king\u0027s bishop. \"If you were to describe this board and the pieces upon it to someone not in this room, how would you do soi\"\\n\\n She shrugged. \"I suppose... that it\u0027s a wooden board with light and dark squares and some pieces in position on it.\"\\n\\n \"Would you say the game is ready to be playedi\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, sir. I would say... it is, but then again I don\u0027t know the particulars.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" He smiled slightly. \"and it is the particulars that make all the difference. I want to thank you for coming to tell me what you\u0027ve remembered. I know this has been very difficult for you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir. But my mama says when the witch is burnt up my head won\u0027t pain me no more.\" She picked up the two buckets. \"May I ask you somethin\u0027 now, siri\u0027\"\\n\\n \"You may.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you suppose Mr. Linch was back there in the dark, singin\u0027 like thati\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, \" he answered.\\n\\n \"I thought on it all this mornin\u0027.\" She stared out the window, the yellow sunlight coloring her face. \"It made my head ache so bad I almost cried, but it seemed like somethin\u0027 I had to keep thinkin\u0027 on.\" Violet didn\u0027t speak for a moment, but Matthew could tell from the set of her jaw that she had come to an important conclusion. \"I think... Mr. Linch must be a friend of Satan\u0027s. That\u0027s what I think.\"\\n\\n \"You might possibly be right. Do you know where I might find Mr. Linchi\"\\n\\n an expression of alarm tightened her face. \"You\u0027re not going to tell him, are youi\"\\n\\n \"No. I promise it. I would just like to know where he lives.\"\\n\\n She hesitated for a few seconds, but she knew he would find out anyway. \"at the end of Industry Street. He lives in the very last house.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if I was right to come here, \" she said, frowning. \"I mean to say... if Mr. Linch is a friend of the Devil, shouldn\u0027t he be called to account for iti\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be called for an accounting, \" Matthew said. \"You may depend on that.\" He touched her shoulder. \"You were right to come. Go ahead, now. Get your water.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\" Violet left the library with her buckets in tow, and a moment later Matthew stood at the window watching her walk to the spring. Then, his mind aflame with this new information, he hurried upstairs to look in on the magistrate.\\n\\n He found Woodward sleeping again, which was probably for the best. The magistrate\u0027s face sparkled with sweat, and when Matthew approached the bed he could feel the man\u0027s fever long before he placed his fingers to Woodward\u0027s hot forehead.\\n\\n The magistrate stirred. His mouth opened, yet his eyes remained sealed. \"Hurting, \" he said, in that tormented whisper. \u0027ann... he\u0027s hurting...\"\\n\\n Matthew drew his hand back. The tips of his fingers felt as if he had held them over a forge. Matthew placed the rolled-up decree atop the dresser and then picked up the box that held the remainder of the court documents so that he might continue reading through them tonight. For now, though, he had other things to do. He went to his room, put the document box on the table beside his bed, splashed water in his face from his shaving bowl to revive his flagging energies, and then was again out the door.\\n\\n It had become a truly magnificent day. The sky was bright blue and cloudless and the sun was gorgeously warm. a light breeze was blowing from the west, and in it Matthew could detect the fragrances of wild honeysuckle, pine sap, and the rich aroma of fulsome earth. He might have sat down upon the bank of the spring to enjoy the warmth, as he saw several citizens doing, but he had a task ahead of him that granted no freedom of time for simple pleasures.\\n\\n On his way along Industry Street - which he was beginning to know quite well - he passed Exodus Jerusalem\u0027s camp. actually, he heard the bluster of Jerusalem\u0027s preaching before he got there and he marvelled that the breeze didn\u0027t become a hot and malodorous tempest in this quarter of Fount Royal. Jerusalem\u0027s sister - and by that term Matthew didn\u0027t know whether the preacher meant by blood or by indecent patronage - was scrubbing clothes in a washpot next to the wagon, while the young nephew - and here it was best to make no mental comment - was lying on a quilt in the shade nearby, picking the petals off a yellow flower and tossing them idly aside. The black-garbed master of ceremonies, however, was hard at work; he stood upon an overturned crate, orating and gesticulating for a somber crowd of two men and a woman.\\n\\n Matthew stared straight ahead, hoping to invoke invisibility as he slipped past Jerusalem\u0027s field of view, but he knew it was not to be. \"ah!\" came the sky-ripping shout. \"ah, there walketh a sinner! Right there! Look, everyone! Look how he doth scurry like a thief in broad daylight!\"\\n\\n What Jerusalem called scurrying Matthew called picking up his pace. He dared not pause to deflect Jerusalem\u0027s hook, for then he would be nattered to holes by this pseudo-holy imbecile. Therefore he kept a constant course, even though the preacher began to rant and rave in a fashion that made Matthew\u0027s blood start to boil: \"Yes, look at him and thy looketh upon the pride of a witch\u0027s bed! Oh, did thou not all know the vile truthi Well, it is as plain as the writ of God across the soul of a righteous man! That sinner yonder hath actually struck me - struck me, I sayeth! - in defense of that wanton sorceress he so dearly yearn-eth to protect! and not just protect! Gentle flock, if thou but kneweth the cravings in that sinner\u0027s mind concerning the dark woman, thou might falleth to thy knees in the frenzy of madness! He wisheth the flesh of her body be gripped in his hands, her mouth open to his abominable needs, her every orifice a receptacle of his goatly lusts! and there he goeth, the blind wretched beast, scurrying away from the word of God lest it scorcheth some light into his eyes and maketh him see the path to Damnation upon which he rusheth to travel!\"\\n\\n The only path upon which Matthew rusheth was the one leading away from Exodus Jerusalem. It occurred to him, as he gladly left the preacher\u0027s caterwaulings behind, that the gentle flock would probably cough up some coins to hear more on the subject of orifices, receptacles, and goatly lusts, which was probably at the heart of it the whole reason for their attendance today. Matthew had to admit that Jerusalem had a talent at painting horny pictures. For now, though - until, dreadfully, he had to come back this way - his attention was focused on finding the ratcatcher\u0027s domicile.\\n\\n He passed the Hamilton house and Violet\u0027s home, and continued by a large weed-choked field where a split-rail fence had fallen to disrepair. Further on, what appeared to be an attempt at an apple orchard was stubbled with dwarfed and twisted trees that seemed to be begging for the mercy of an axe. On the opposite side of Industry Street, the feeble trees of another unfortunate planting drooped in apparent pain, their few remaining leaves blotched with brown and ochre sores. In this area of Fount Royal, the sun might be shining but there was definitely no rejoicing of nature.\\n\\n Matthew saw that Bidwell\u0027s orchards had suffered greatly during the long period of storms. The coarse, sandy earth had been washed away to such an extent that some trees seemed more exposed roots than branches, and what branches there were had shrivelled and malformed in their piteous reach for sunlight. Here and there some kind of knobby-looking thing had sprouted, but it was more green mold than edible product. This display of blighted agriculture seemed to stretch on and on like a preview of the harvests of Hell, and Matthew could readily understand how Bidwell and the citizens might ascribe the devastation not to natural causes but to a demonic purpose.\\n\\n as Matthew continued walking between the miserable fields he reflected on the possibility that, in addition to the havoc wreaked by the deluge, this climate and soil might not be suited to sustain the types of crops that Bidwell was trying to grow. Of course Bidwell was trying to produce something that would earn him money and attention from the home country, but it might be that apples, for instance, were doomed in this swamp air. Likewise doomed was whatever those green molded things were. It might be, then, that a suitable cash crop for Fount Royal was yet to be planted, and Bidwell could benefit from the advice of a professional botanist. Yet a botanist would command a sizeable fee, and Matthew thought that if Winston was correct about Bidwell\u0027s combination of stinginess and swollen self-worth - and there was no reason to doubt it - then the master of Fount Royal was apt to consider himself as much an expert on growing crops as in building ships.\\n\\n Presently Matthew came to the last dwelling on Industry Street, beyond which stood the fortress wall.\\n\\n If the ratcatcher desired to live apart from other human beings, he could only have created a more suitable abode by digging a hole in the earth and covering it with a mudcaked roof. The house - -if it might be distinguished by such a term - made Winston\u0027s shack appear the brother of Bidwell\u0027s mansion. Brush had been allowed to grow up around it, all but obscuring it from view. Vines gripped the gray clapboards and ivy grew abundant on the roof. The house\u0027s four windows were sealed by unpainted and badly weathered shutters, and Matthew thought it was a wonder the rains hadn\u0027t broken the poor place down to the ground entirely.\\n\\n Matthew made his way to the door over a bare yard still treacherous with mud. Over the door Linch had hung three large rat skeletons from leather cords, as if to announce his trade to the world - whatever portion of the world cared to come to this place, that is. But then again, perhaps those three rats had given him such a fight Linch felt the need to mount them as trophies. Matthew swallowed his disgust, balled up his fist, and knocked at the door.\\n\\n He waited, but there was no response. Matthew knocked again, and this time called, \"Mr. Linchi May I speak with you, pleasei\" Still there was no answer. The ratcatcher was out, probably pursuing some long-tailed dame or dandy.\\n\\n Matthew had come a distance to see the man, and he despised the thought of making a second trip. He might wait for Linch, he decided, though there was no telling when the ratcatcher would return. He knocked a third time, just to know he had, and then he put his hand on the door\u0027s crude latch. He paused, weighing his sense of morality as concerning entering a man\u0027s home unbidden.\\n\\n Pulling his hand back, he stepped away from the door and stood looking at the latch with his hands on his hips. What was the right thing to doi He glanced up Industry Street the way he\u0027d come. There was no sign of a living soul. Of course, the right thing was to leave and return at a later time. The necessary thing... now that was a horse pulling a different cart.\\n\\n But he wasn\u0027t sure he wanted to enter Linch\u0027s sanctum. If a place ever smelled like dead rats, he was sure this one did. and those skeletons did not speak well of what else might be on display in there. Matthew looked again down Industry Street. Still no sign of anyone. If he wanted a chance to explore the ratcatcher\u0027s quarters, this was definitely the moment.\\n\\n He took a deep breath. Trespassing upon a house was far different than intruding upon a barn... or was iti He didn\u0027t care to debate the distinction.\\n\\n He quickly lifted the latch, before he could think better of it, and pushed the door open. It went smoothly, on oiled hinges. and by the sunlight that entered the house Matthew saw a very strange thing.\\n\\n He stood at the threshold, peering in and wondering if he had lost his senses. Or at least his sense of order. This revelation took him inside. He looked around, his curiosity now well and truly piqued.\\n\\n There was a desk and a sleeping pallet, a hearth and a shelf of cooking utensils. There was a chair and beside it a table on which sat a lantern. Nearby were a half-dozen candles wrapped up in oiled paper. a chamberpot was placed at the foot of the pallet. Two pairs of dirty shoes were lined up side-by-side next to the hearth, which was perfectly devoid of ashes. a broom leaned against the wall, ready for work.\\n\\n and this was what so completely astounded Matthew: Linch\u0027s dwelling was the absolute picture of neatness.\\n\\n The pallet had been made, its bedding tight and precise. The chamberpot was spotless. So too were the cooking pots and utensils. The lantern\u0027s glass bore not a trace of candlesoot. The floor and walls had been recently scrubbed, and the house still smelled of pinetar soap. Matthew thought he might have eaten off that floor and not tasted a grain of dirt. Everything was so orderly that it put a scare into Matthew even more than the terrible chaos of Winston\u0027s home, for the single reason that - like Winston had been - the ratcatcher was not who he appeared to be.\\n\\n \"Well, \" Matthew said, and his voice trembled. He looked once more toward town, but thankfully Industry Street was still empty. Then he continued his examination of this place that seemed to be a hovel from without but within was the epitome of ... might the word Matthew was searching for be controli\\n\\n This was one of the damnedest things he\u0027d ever seen. The only bad note in the house was the foursome of dirty shoes, and Matthew thought those were part of Linch\u0027s ratcatching costume. He decided to add a pound to his penny of intrusion and therefore opened a trunk, finding within it more clothes - shirts, breeches, and stockings, all of them clean and perfectly folded.\\n\\n Beside the lantern and the candles was a small ivory box. Matthew opened it and discovered matches and a flint, the matches all lined up like obedient soldiers. In a larger box that occupied a corner Matthew discovered a supply of salted beef, ears of com, a pot of flour and a pot of grain, a bottle of rum and a bottle of wine, and various other foodstuffs. Upon the desk was a clay pipe and a carefully wrapped packet of tobacco. There was also an inkpot, a quill, and some papers ready to be written upon. He slid open the desk\u0027s top drawer, and found a second inkpot and a stack of paper, a leather wallet and... wonder of wonders... a book.\\n\\n It was a thin volume, but a well-read and well-travelled tome, from the wear and tear of the binding. Matthew gently opened it to the title page - which threatened to fall out between his fingers - and received another puzzlement. The book\u0027s title, faded as it was, read a Pharaoh\u0027s Life, or Concerning Fanciful Events in ancient Egypt.\\n\\n Matthew knew that Egyptian culture, known through the travails of Moses in the Holy Bible, was a source of great fascination to a certain segment of the English and European populace - mainly, those gentry who had the time and inclination to indulge in theories and discourse on what that mysterious civilization might have been like. He could have expected a book of this nature to adorn Bidwell\u0027s library, simply for the show of it, but never touched; it was absolutely incredible that the ratcatcher might have an interest in the life of a pharaoh, however fancifully described. Matthew would have paged through the book to get an idea of its contents, but as the leaves were so fragile he decided to forgo that particular exploration. It was enough for now to know that Gwinett Linch was not the man he presented himself to be.\\n\\n But if not... then who was hei\\n\\n Matthew closed the book and made sure it was exactly in the position it had been when he\u0027d touched it, as he had the feeling that Linch would know if it had been moved a hair\u0027s width. He picked up the wallet, unfolded it, and found inside a small object wrapped in brown cotton cloth and secured with knotted twine. Matthew\u0027s interest was further sharpened. The problem, however, was not the undoing of the twine but in the redoing of it. Was it worth the time and efforti\\n\\n He decided it was.\\n\\n He carefully untied the cord, noting the structure of the knot. Then he opened the cloth.\\n\\n It was a piece of jewelry: a circular gold brooch, but missing its clasping pin. Picking up the item, he held it into the sunlight... and stared with amazement into the blazing dark blue depths of a sapphire that was near the size of his thumbnail.\\n\\n The hairs stood up on the back of his neck. He twisted his head around, his eyes widening, but the doorway was empty.\\n\\n Linch - or the man who called himself Linch - was not there. From where he stood, Matthew could see no one approaching. But he was certain that if Linch found him with this fabulous jewel in his hand, his life would be as short as that of a belly-gashed rat on the bloody blade of that sticker.\\n\\n Time to go. Time to get out, while he could.\\n\\n First, though, to wrap the brooch up once more, return it to the wallet and replace the wallet exactly - exactly - as it had been. His hands were shaking, as precision was a demanding taskmaster. When the wallet was correctly positioned, Matthew slid the drawer shut and stepped back, wiping his moist palms on his hips.\\n\\n There were other drawers he might have wished to go through, and he might have desired to inspect the underside of Linch\u0027s pallet and further explore the house, but it would be daring Fate. He retreated to the door and was about to shut it when he realized with a shock that he had smeared across the otherwise-pristine floor a small amount of mud from the sodden yard.\\n\\n He bent down, attempting to get the debris up with his hand. He succeeded somewhat but there was still a telltale streak. No doubt of it: Linch was going to know his sanctum had been violated.\\n\\n a bell began ringing in the distance. Matthew, still working at removing the stain of his presence by spittle and elbow-grease, realized it was the watchman at the gate signaling an arrival. He had done the best he could do. a little grime on the floor would pall before the gore that would flow if Linch found him here. He stood up, went out, pulled the door shut, and dropped its latch.\\n\\n as Matthew started walking back along Industry Street, the signal bell ceased. He assumed that the new arrival had been allowed into Fount Royal. Would that it was a doctor whose method was more medicine and less bloodletting!\\n\\n The sun warmed his face and the breeze blew softly at his back. Yet Matthew had never felt as if he walked a darker or colder path. The sapphire in that brooch had to be worth a small fortune, therefore why was Linch stabbing rats for a livingi and why did he go to such effort to disguise his true nature, which appeared to be a preference for order and control, behind a facade of filthinessi It seemed to Matthew that Linch even wished his house to look absolutely decrepit from the outside and had gone to some lengths to make it so.\\n\\n This pit of deceit was deeper than he\u0027d expected. But what did it have to do with Racheli Linch was obviously a learned, intelligent man who could write with a quill and read books of theoretical substance; he was also quite well off financially, judging from the sapphire brooch. Why in the world was he acting such a wretched parti\\n\\n and then there was the singing to consider. Had Violet gone into the Hamilton house or noti If she had, why didn\u0027t she notice the disagreeable odor of that dead dogi and if she had not gone in, then what strange power had made her believe she hadi No, no; it was confusing to even his disciplined mind. The most troubling things about Violet\u0027s supposed entrance into the house were her sighting of the white-haired imp and her memory of the six gold buttons on Satan\u0027s cloak. Those details she shared with Buckner and Garrick were damnable evidence against Rachel. But what about the ratcatcher singing in that dark room where Matthew had found the bitch and her pupsi One might say Violet had imagined it, but then could one not infer that she\u0027d imagined the whole incidenti But she could not imagine details that had already been supplied by Buckner and Garrick!\\n\\n So: if Violet had entered the house, why was the ratcatcher singing back there in the darki and if she had not entered the house, why - and how - did she fervently believe she had, and from where did those details of the white-haired imp and the six gold buttons comei\\n\\n He was thinking so furiously on these questions that he failed to gird his wits for his return engagement with Exodus Jerusalem, but he found that the preacher\u0027s tongue had ceased its salivation over orifices. Indeed, Jerusalem, the trio of audience, and the so-called sister and the so-called nephew had departed and were nowhere to be seen. Matthew was soon aware, however, of a balhaloo in progress on Harmony Street. He saw four covered wagons and fifteen or twenty townspeople thronged about them. a lean gray-bearded man wearing a green tricorn sat at the reins of the first wagon\u0027s team and was engaged in conversation with Bidwell. Matthew also saw Winston standing behind his master; the cur had gone to some effort to shave and dress in clean clothes to make a presentable picture, and he was speaking to a young blond-haired man who appeared to be a companion to the wagon driver.\\n\\n Matthew approached a farmer standing nearby. \"May I ask what\u0027s going oni\"\\n\\n \"The maskers have come, \" the man, who had perhaps three teeth in his head, answered.\\n\\n \"Maskersi You mean actorsi\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. They come every year and show a play. Weren\u0027t expected \u0027til midsummer, though.\"\\n\\n Matthew was amazed at the tenacity of a travelling actors\u0027 troupe to negotiate the bone-jarring road between here and Charles Town. He recalled a book on the English theater he\u0027d seen in Bidwell\u0027s library, and realized Bidwell had engineered a yearly entertainment - a midsummer festival, so to speak - for his citizenry.\\n\\n \"Now we\u0027ll have a fine time!\" the farmer said, grinning that cavernous mouth. \"a witch-burnin\u0027 in the morn and a play in the eve!\"\\n\\n Matthew did not reply. He observed that the gray-bearded man, who appeared to be the troupe\u0027s leader, seemed to be asking instructions or directions from Bidwell. The master of Fount Royal conferred for a moment with Winston, whose outward mannerisms gave no inkling that he was anything but a loyal servant. Then, the conference done, Bidwell spoke again to the bearded man and motioned westward along Industry Street. Matthew realized Bidwell must be telling the man where the actors might set up their camp. He would have paid an admission fee to hear the thoughts of Exodus Jerusalem when the preacher learned his neighbors would be thespians. Then again, Jerusalem might make some extra coins by giving the players acting lessons.\\n\\n Matthew went on his way, avoiding contact with Bidwell and the scoundrel in his shadow. He paused for a short while at the spring, watching the golden sunlight ripple on the water\u0027s surface. It entered his mind to go to the gaol and look in on Rachel; in fact, he felt an urgent need to see her, but with a considerable effort of willpower he declined. She had made it clear she did not want his presence there, and as much as it pained him, he must respect her wishes.\\n\\n He returned to the house, found Mrs. Nettles, and asked if he might have some lunch. after a quick repast of corn soup and buttered bread, he ascended the stairs to his room and settled in a chair by the open window to contemplate his findings and to finish reading through the documents.\\n\\n He could not shake the feeling, as he read the answers to the questions he had posed, that a revelation was close at hand. He only dimly heard the singing of birds and sensed the warmth of the sun, as all his attention was focused on these responses. There had to be something in here - something small, something overlooked - that might be a key to prove Rachel\u0027s innocence. as he read, however, he was distracted by two things: first, the bellring-ing and braying voice of a public crier announcing the magistrate\u0027s decree even in the slave quarters; and second, the sound of an axe chopping timber in the woods between the mansion and the tidewater swamp.\\n\\n Matthew reached the end of the documents. He had found nothing. He realized he was looking for a shadow that may or may not exist, and to find it - if it was discoverable - he must concentrate on reading between the lines. He ran a weary hand over his face, and began once more from the beginning. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-28.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \\n Judgment of the Witch \\n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
