{"id":85897,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"MaTTHEW WaS SHOCKED at his first sight of the magistrate, just before two o\u0027clock. Woodward, who entered the gaol supported between Hannibal Green and Nicholas Paine, wore a long gray overcoat and a rust-colored scarf wrapped about his throat. His face - which glistened with sweat and was a few shades lighter than his coat - was cast downward, mindful of his walking. He took feeble steps, as if he\u0027d aged twenty years since Matthew had seen him yesterday afternoon.\\n\\n When Green had brought the midday meal, he\u0027d explained to Matthew that the course of the trial had been delayed because the magistrate had fallen very ill during the night, but what he heard from Paine was that Elias Garrick was scheduled to appear at two o\u0027clock. Therefore Matthew had expected to see the magistrate under the weather, but not become a near invalid. He realized at once that Woodward should be in bed - or possibly even at Dr. Shields\u0027s infirmary.\\n\\n \"What are you bringing him in here fori\" Matthew protested, standing at the bars. \"The magistrate\u0027s not healthy enough to sit at court today!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m following Mr. Bidwell\u0027s orders,\" Paine replied, as he steadied Woodward while Green unlocked the cell. \"He said to bring the magistrate here.\"\\n\\n \"This is an outrage! The magistrate shouldn\u0027t be forced to work when he\u0027s hardly strong enough to stand!\"\\n\\n \"I see no one forcing him,\" Paine answered. Green got the door open and then helped Paine walk Woodward through. a strong, bitter medicinal odor also entered.\\n\\n \"I demand to see Bidwell!\" Matthew had almost shouted it, his cheeks reddening as his temper rose. \"Bring him here this minute!\"\\n\\n \"Hush,\" the magistrate whispered. \"That hurts my ears.\"\\n\\n \"Sir, why did you allow yourself to be brought herei You\u0027re in no condition to - \"\\n\\n \"The work must be done,\" Woodward interrupted. \"The sooner the trial is ended . . . the sooner we may leave this wretched town.\" He eased himself down into his chair. \"Hot tea,\" he said to Paine, his face pinched with the effort of speech.\\n\\n \"Yes sir, I\u0027ll get you some directly.\"\\n\\n \"But not from Mrs. Vaughan,\" Woodward said. \"I\u0027ll drink any tea but hers.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Paine!\" Matthew said as he and Green started to leave the cell. \"You know the magistrate has no business being here!\"\\n\\n \"Matthew, settle yourself,\" Woodward cautioned, in his raw whisper. \"I may be somewhat ill . . . but I have my responsibilities. You have your own. Be seated and prepare for our witness.\" He glanced through the bars into the next cage. \"Good afternoon, madam.\" Rachel nodded at him from her seat on the bench, her face grim but well composed. Paine and Green left the cell and made their way out of the gaol.\\n\\n \"Sit and prepare,\" Woodward repeated to his clerk. \"Mr. Garrick will soon be here.\"\\n\\n Matthew knew there was no point in further argument. He put the Bible in front of Woodward, then opened the desk drawer into which he\u0027d placed the box of writing supplies and placed it atop his own desk. He sat down, lifted the boxlid, and removed the quill, inkwell, and paper, after he began to massage his right hand to warm it for the exertion that was to follow. The noise of Woodward\u0027s husky, labored breathing was going to be a considerable distraction. In fact, he didn\u0027t know how he could concentrate at all today. He said, \"Sir, tell me this: how are you going to ask questions of Mr. Garrick when you can hardly speaki\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Garrick will do most of the speaking.\" Woodward paused, securing a breath. His eyes closed for a few seconds; he felt so weak he feared he might have to lay his head down upon the desk. The pungent fumes of the liniment that even now heated his chest, back, and throat rose around his face and up his swollen nostrils. He opened his eyes, his vision blurred. \"I will do my task,\" he vowed. \"Just do yours.\"\\n\\n In a few minutes Edward Winston entered the gaol with Elias Garrick, who wore a dark brown suit that appeared two sizes too small and bore fresh patches on the elbows and knees. His gray hair had been combed back against his scalp with glistening pomade. Garrick looked fearfully into the cell at Rachel Howarth, prompting Winston to say, \"She can\u0027t harm you, Elias. Come along.\"\\n\\n Garrick was motioned toward the stool that had been positioned before Woodward\u0027s desk. He sat down upon it, his gaunt-cheeked face cast toward the floor. His sinewy hands clasped together, as if in silent supplication.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to be fine.\" Winston placed his hand on Gar-rick\u0027s shoulder. \"Magistrate, you can understand that Elias is a bit nervous, with the witch in such close proximity.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t be kept long,\" was Woodward\u0027s rasped reply.\\n\\n \"Uh . . . well sir, I was wondering, then.\" Winston raised his eyebrows. \"What time should I bring Violet adamsi\"\\n\\n \"Pardoni\"\\n\\n \"Violet adams,\" Winston said. \"The child. Mr. Bidwell told me to fetch her later this afternoon. What time would be agreeablei\"\\n\\n \"One moment!\" It was all Matthew could do to keep his seat. \"The magistrate\u0027s only seeing one witness today!\"\\n\\n \"Well. . . Mr. Bidwell seems to think otherwise. On the way to get Elias, I stopped at the adams house and informed the family that Violet was expected to testify this afternoon. It was Mr. Bidwell\u0027s wish that the trial be concluded today.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care whose wish it was! Magistrate Woodward is too ill to - \"\\n\\n Woodward suddenly reached our and grasped Matthew\u0027s arm, squeezing it to command silence. \"Very well,\" he whispered. \"Bring the child ... at four o\u0027clock.\"\\n\\n \"I shall.\"\\n\\n Matthew looked incredulously at the magistrate, who paid him no attention.\\n\\n \"Thank you, Mr. Winston,\" Woodward said. \"You may go.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\" Winston gave Garrick a reassuring pat on the shoulder and took his leave.\\n\\n Before Matthew could say anything more, Woodward picked up the Bible and offered it to Garrick. \"Hold this. Matthew, swear him to truth.\"\\n\\n Matthew obeyed. When the ritual was done and Matthew reached out to take the Good Book, Garrick pressed it against his chest. \"Pleasei Might I keep a\u0027hold of iti\"\\n\\n \"You may,\" Woodward answered. \"Go ahead and tell your story.\"\\n\\n \"You mean what I already done told youi\"\\n\\n \"This time for the record.\" Woodward motioned toward Matthew, who sat with his quill freshly dipped and poised over the paper.\\n\\n \"Where do you want me to starti\"\\n\\n \"From the beginning.\"\\n\\n \"all right, then.\" Garrick continued to stare at the floor, then licked his lips and said, \"Well . . . like I done told you, my land\u0027s right next to the Howarth farm. That night I was feelin\u0027 poorly, and I waked up to go outside and spew what was makin\u0027 me ill. It was silent. Everythin\u0027 was silent, like the whole world was afeared to breathe.\"\\n\\n \"Siri\" Matthew said to the farmer. \"What time would you make this to bei\"\\n\\n \"What timei Oh . . . two or three, maybe. I don\u0027t recall.\" He looked at Woodward. \"Want me to go oni\" Woodward nodded. \"anyways, I went out. That\u0027s when I seen somebody crossin\u0027 the Howarth cornfield. Wasn\u0027t no stalks that time of year, y\u0027see. I seen this person walkin\u0027 in the field, without no lantern. I thought it was awful strange, so I went over the fence, and I followed \u0027em behind the barn. That\u0027s when . . .\" He stared at the floor again, a pulse beating at his temple. \"That\u0027s when I seen the witch naked and on her knees, tendin\u0027 to her master.\"\\n\\n \"By \u0027the witch,\u0027 do you mean Rachel Howarthi\" Woodward\u0027s frail whisper had just about vanished.\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\"\\n\\n Woodward started to ask another question, but now his voice would not respond. He had reached the end of his questioning. He looked at Matthew, his face stricken. \"Matthewi\" he was able to say. \"aski\"\\n\\n Matthew realized the magistrate was giving over to him the reins of this interview. He redipped his quill, a dark anger simmering in him that Bidwell had either forced or persuaded the magistrate to imperil his health in such a fashion. But now that the interview had begun, it should be finished. Matthew cleared his throat. \"Mr. Garrick,\" he said, \"what do you mean by \u0027master\u0027i\"\\n\\n \"Well. . . Satan, I reckon.\"\\n\\n \"and this figure was wearing exactly whati\"\\n\\n \"a black cloak and a cowl, like I done told you. There was gold buttons on the front. I seen \u0027em shine in the moonlight.\"\\n\\n \"You couldn\u0027t see this figure\u0027s facei\"\\n\\n \"No sir, but I seen . . . that thing the witch was suckin\u0027 on. That black cock covered with thorns. Couldn\u0027t be nobody but Satan hisself, owned somethin\u0027 like that.\\n\\n \"and you say Rachel Howarth was completely nakedi\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, she was.\"\\n\\n \"What were you wearingi\"\\n\\n \"Siri\" Garrick frowned.\\n\\n \"Your clothes,\" Matthew said. \"What were you wearingi\" Garrick paused, thinking about it. \"Well sir, I had on ... I mean to say. I . . .\" His frown deepened. \"That\u0027s might odd,\" he said at last. \"I can\u0027t recall.\"\\n\\n \"a coat, I presumei\" Matthew prodded. \"Since it was cold outi\"\\n\\n Garrick slowly blinked. \"a coat,\" he said. \"Must\u0027ve had on my coat, but... I don\u0027t remember puttin\u0027 it on.\"\\n\\n \"and shoesi Or bootsi\"\\n\\n \"Shoes,\" he said. \"No, wait. My boots. Yes sir, I believe I had on my boots.\"\\n\\n \"Did you get a good look at Rachel Howarth\u0027s face, there behind the barni\"\\n\\n \"Well. . . not her face, sir,\" Garrick admitted. \"Just her backside. She was kneelin\u0027 away from me. But I seen her hair. and she was a dark-skinned woman. It was her, all right.\" He glanced uneasily at the magistrate and then back to Matthew. \"It had to be her. It was Daniel\u0027s land.\"\\n\\n Matthew nodded, scribing down what Garrick had just said. \"Did you spewi\" he asked suddenly.\\n\\n \"Siri\"\\n\\n Matthew lifted his face and stared directly into Garrick\u0027s dull eyes. \"Did you spewi You left your bed to go outside for that purpose. Did you do soi\"\\n\\n again, Garrick had to think about it. \"I . . . don\u0027t recall if I did,\" he said. \"No, I think I seen that figure crossin\u0027 the Howarth cornfield, and I . . . must\u0027ve forgot \u0027bout feelin\u0027 poorly.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go back a bit, please,\" Matthew instructed. \"What time had you gone to bed that nighti\"\\n\\n \"Usual time. \u0027Bout half past eight, I reckon.\"\\n\\n \"Both you and your wife went to bed at the same timei\"\\n\\n \"Thereabouts, yes sir.\"\\n\\n \"Were you feeling poorly when you went to bedi\"\\n\\n \"No sir. I don\u0027t think I was.\" He licked his lips again, a nervous gesture. \"Pardon me for askin\u0027, but . . . what\u0027s all this got to do with the witchi\"\\n\\n Matthew looked at the magistrate. Woodward\u0027s chin had drooped, but his eyes were open and he gave no sign of wishing to interfere - even if that were possible - with Matthew\u0027s line of inquiry. Matthew returned his attention to Garrick. \"I\u0027m trying to clear up a point of confusion I have,\" he explained. \"So you did not go to bed feeling ill, but you awakened perhaps six hours later sick to your stomachi\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\"\\n\\n \"You got out of bed carefully, so as not to awaken your wifei\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, that\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"and theni\"\\n\\n \"Then I went outside to spew,\" Garrick said. \"But before that didn\u0027t you pause to put on your coat and bootsi\"\\n\\n \"I . . . well. . . yes sir, I must\u0027ve, but I can\u0027t rightly recall it.\"\\n\\n \"How many gold buttons,\" Matthew said, \"were on the front of Satan\u0027s cloaki\"\\n\\n \"Six,\" Garrick answered.\\n\\n \"Sixi Of that number you\u0027re positivei\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\" He nodded vigorously. \"I seen \u0027em shine in the moonlight.\"\\n\\n \"It was a full moon, theni\"\\n\\n \"Siri\"\\n\\n \"a full moon,\" Matthew repeated. \"Was it a full mooni\"\\n\\n \"Reckon it had to be. But I don\u0027t recall ever lookin\u0027 up at it.\"\\n\\n \"and even with this bright moonlight - which enabled you to see a figure crossing a distant field without a lantern - you were unable to see Satan\u0027s facei\"\\n\\n \"Well sir . . . the Devil was wearin\u0027 a cowl over his head.\"\\n\\n \"That may be so, but were not the buttons on the front of his cloaki If the bright moonlight made those six gold buttons so memorable, could you not see a portion of his facei\"\\n\\n \"No sir.\" Garrick shifted uneasily on the stool. \"It weren\u0027t his face that caught my sight. It was . . . that terrible big thing the witch was suckin\u0027 on.\"\\n\\n \"Covered with thorns, I think you\u0027ve already told usi\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, it was.\"\\n\\n \"Satan spoke to you, did he noti In fact, he called you by namei\" Garrick nodded. \"Did you not look at Satan\u0027s face when he spoke to youi\"\\n\\n \"I believe I did. But . . . there weren\u0027t nothin\u0027 there but dark.\"\\n\\n \"Did Rachel Howarth ever turn her face toward youi\"\\n\\n \"No sir, she didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Matthew paused to lay aside his quill and massage his hand again. He glanced once more at Woodward, and saw that the magistrate was still motionless but his eyes were open and his breathing was steady, if very labored.\\n\\n \"Mr. Garrick!\" Rachel suddenly said, standing at the bars. \"What have I ever done to you, to cause you to make up these liesi\"\\n\\n \"They ain\u0027t lies!\" Garrick hugged the Bible for protection. \"You know I seen you, out there givin\u0027 service to your master!\"\\n\\n \"I was never behind that barn, doing such a sin! and I never consorted with such a creature! If you\u0027re not lying, your mind has invented a fantasy!\"\\n\\n Woodward loudly slapped his hand upon the table for order, and immediately Matthew said, \"Silence, please! Madam Howarth, I speak for the magistrate when I say it\u0027s in your best interest not to disrupt the testimony.\"\\n\\n \"Her best interesti\" Garrick sounded amazed. \"Have you taken the witch\u0027s sidei\"\\n\\n \"No, Mr. Garrick, I have not. I\u0027m only pointing out to Madam Howarth that it is your right to speak without interruption.\" Matthew started to pick up the quill again when Nicholas Paine entered the gaol bearing a basket.\\n\\n \"Pardon the intrusion, but I have your tea.\" Paine came into the cell, placed the basket before Woodward, and opened it. Inside was a simple white clay pot and a single cup. \"Compliments of Mrs. Zeborah Crawford.\"\\n\\n \"My thanks,\" Woodward whispered.\\n\\n \"Will you be needing anything elsei\"\\n\\n Woodward thought about it. He patted the desk in front of him. \"Poppets,\" he said.\\n\\n \"The poppetsi You wish to see themi\" Woodward nodded. \"Now.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re at my house. I\u0027ll go directly and fetch them.\" Paine cast a quick glance in the direction of Rachel and then hurried out.\\n\\n Matthew had his quill in hand once more, and a fresh sheet of paper before him. \"May I continue, siri\" he asked Woodward, who was pouring himself a cup of dark brown brew, and he received a slight nod as a signal to proceed. \"Mr. Garricki\" Matthew said. \"Think hard on this next question, if you will. Put the image of Satan\u0027s six gold buttons in your mind, and tell me if they were fixed on the cloak six in a straight line or three side by sidei\"\\n\\n There was a sharp clatter of crockery. Matthew looked to his left to see that Woodward had spilled his tea. The magistrate was staring at him as if the clerk had taken leave of his senses.\\n\\n \"It is a pertinent question, sir,\" Matthew said. \"I do think it deserves an answer.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s foolish,\" Woodward whispered, his gray face stern as a rock.\\n\\n \"Might you reserve your opinion until after the question is answeredi\"\\n\\n \"What kind of question is iti\" Garrick asked, visibly agitated. \"I thought I was brung here to tell you \u0027bout the witch, not about buttons!\"\\n\\n \"You were brought here to tell us whatever is necessary for the magistrate to weigh his judgment,\" Matthew countered. \"Remember, sir, that you hold a Holy Bible, and that you\u0027ve vowed to speak only the truth. Remember that God is listening to your answer.\" He paused a few seconds to let Garrick reflect on that pronouncement. \"Now: were the six buttons arranged in a single line, or were they three side by sidei\"\\n\\n \"They were . . .\" Garrick suddenly stopped. His tongue flicked out again, wetting his lips. His fingers tightened on the Bible, his knuckles whitening. \"They were . . .\" again he faltered. His face seemed threatened by conflicting currents that moved beneath the skin. He took a long breath, in preparation to make his decision. \"Six gold buttons,\" he said. \"On the black cloak. I seen \u0027em. Shine in the moonlight.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Matthew said. \"But what arrangement were they ini\" Garrick frowned; his mouth worked, but no sound emerged. His right hand began to rub in small circles on the Bible. He stared blankly at nothing, his eyes glazed and the pulse beating harder at his temple. Matthew realized that Woodward had leaned slightly forward and his expression had become keen.\\n\\n \"It was a silent town,\" Garrick said, in what was almost a whisper. a glaze of sweat glistened on his forehead. \"Silent. The whole world, afeared to breathe.\"\\n\\n Matthew had been taking down every word that the man uttered. He redipped his quill and held it ready. \"It\u0027s a simple question, sir. Do you not have an answeri\" Garrick slowly blinked, his jaw slack. \"Siri\" Matthew prompted. \"an answer, pleasei\"\\n\\n \"The six gold buttons were . . . they . . .\" He stared into nothingness for a moment longer, and then he shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"They caught your attention and were clearly defined by the moonlight, yesi\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t recall how they were arranged on the cloaki\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Garrick said, his voice thick. \"I . . . can see them buttons in my head. I see \u0027em shinin\u0027 in the moonlight, but ... I don\u0027t know if they was straight down or three by three.\"\\n\\n \"all right, then. Tell us what happened after Satan spoke to you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\" Garrick lifted a hand from the Good Book and wiped his damp forehead. \"He . . . asked me if I liked what I was a\u0027lookin\u0027 at. I didn\u0027t want to speak, but he made me say \u0027yes.\u0027 He made me. Then he laughed, and I was ashamed. He let me go. I ran home, and I got in bed beside my \u0027Becca. That next mornin\u0027 I went to see Mr. Paine and I told him the whole story.\"\\n\\n \"When you say he let you go, do you mean he held you spellboundi\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, I believe he did. I wanted to run, but I couldn\u0027t move.\"\\n\\n \"Did he release you with a word or a gesturei\"\\n\\n again, Garrick frowned as he tried to assemble his thoughts. \"I can\u0027t say. all I know is, he let me go.\"\\n\\n \"and your wife was still sleeping when you teturned to bedi\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, she was. She never waked up at all. I closed my eyes tight as I could, and next thing I knew I heard the cock crow and it was mornin\u0027.\"\\n\\n Matthew\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"You mean after that experience you had no trouble falling asleepi\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if I did or not. The cock crowed, and I waked up.\"\\n\\n Matthew glanced quickly at the magistrate before he posed the following question: \"Mr. Garrick, sir, is it possible - just possible - that you were never awake at alli\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you mean, sir.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m asking if what you thought was real may have been a dream. Is there any possibility of thati\"\\n\\n \"No sir!\" Garrick clutched the Bible tightly once more. \"It all happened like I said! I woke up with stomach trouble and had to spew, and I went outside! I seen that devil and the witch there behind that barn sure as I\u0027m lookin\u0027 at you! I swear before the Lord God I did!\"\\n\\n Matthew said quietly, \"There\u0027s no need for such swearing. You hold the Bible and you\u0027ve already vowed your story is the truth. You are a God-fearing man, aren\u0027t youi\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, I am. If I was lyin\u0027 to you, I\u0027d be struck dead in an instant!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you believe so. I have only one last question for you, and then - with the magistrate\u0027s approval, of course - you may go. My question is: how many buttons are on the coat you wore that nighti\"\\n\\n \"Siri\" Garrick tilted his head to one side, as if his ears hadn\u0027t quite caught the inquiry.\\n\\n \"You seem to be a highly observant individual,\" Matthew said. \"Can you tell me how many buttons adorn the coat you put on before you went outside to spewi\"\\n\\n \"Well. . . like I said, I don\u0027t recall puttin\u0027 my coat on.\"\\n\\n \"But you must know how many buttons it has. I presume you wear it quite a lot in cold weather. How manyi Fouri Fivei Six, perhapsi\"\\n\\n \"Five,\" Garrick answered. \"No ... I think one of \u0027em broke off. It must be four.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Matthew said, and he put his quill aside. \"Magistrate, I would suggest that Mr. Garrick be freed to go home.\"\\n\\n \"are you surei\" Woodward whispered, not without some sarcasm.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure Mr. Garrick has told us the truth, as far as he knows the truth to be. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any use in keeping him here.\"\\n\\n Woodward took a drink of tea and put the cup aside. \"Good day,\" he told the farmer. \"The court thanks you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m free to go, theni\" Garrick stood up. He reluctantly relinquished his grip on the Bible and laid it back before the magistrate. \"May I be bold to say, sir ... I hope I\u0027ve helped send that witch to the fire. Reverend Grove was a right good man, and what I knew of Daniel he was a Christian too. But when Satan slips into a town, there ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 that follows but wickedness and tears.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Garricki\" Matthew said as the man started to leave the cell. \"In your opinion, was it Rachel Howarth or Satan who committed those murdersi\"\\n\\n \"Had to be Satan, I\u0027d say. I seen Grove\u0027s body laid out in the church, and I seen Daniel\u0027s a\u0027layin\u0027 in the field. a throat cut like those were . . . couldn\u0027t been a woman\u0027s hand that done it.\"\\n\\n \"In your opinion, as a God-fearing soul, would you believe that Satan could freely enter a church and murder a man of the Lordi\"\\n\\n \"I would never have thought it. But it happened, didn\u0027t iti\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Matthew said. \"You may go.\"\\n\\n as soon as Garrick left the gaol Rachel said, \"You understand it now, don\u0027t youi He was dreaming the whole thing!\"\\n\\n \"That is a distinct possibility.\" Matthew looked at the magistrate, who was stroking his unshaven chin with his fingers. \"Would you agree, siri\"\\n\\n Woodward took his time in offering a reply It seemed to him that Matthew was awfully quick in his attempts to deflect Garrick\u0027s testimony The boy was very intelligent, yes; but it appeared to Woodward that Matthew was sharper and quicker now rhat he\u0027d ever seen him to be. Of course, never before had Matthew been put into the position of commanding an interrogation, and perhaps his abilities had simply risen to the challenge, but . . . there was something a bit frightening in his desire to destroy Garrick\u0027s Bible-sworn sratements.\\n\\n It was a fervor, Woodward decided, that bore careful watching. He sipped the bitter tea and whispered, \"This court is not yet adjourned. Let us keep our opinions in rein.\"\\n\\n \"It seems to me, sir,\" Matthew plowed on, \"that Mr. Garrick\u0027s testimony bears all the signs of being a dream. Some things he can recall quite vividly, while others - things he ought to be able to know - are lost to his memory.\"\\n\\n \"Though my voice is weak,\" Woodward said, \"my ears are still in order. I heard exactly what you did.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" Matthew decided he should retreat on this subject. \"Pardon my manners.\"\\n\\n \"Pardon accepted. Now be quiet.\" Matthew took the time to clean his quill. Woodward poured himself a fresh cup and Rachel paced back and forth in her cage.\\n\\n Nicholas Paine returned carrying a bundle wrapped with white cloth. Instantly Rachel stopped her pacing and came to the bars to watch. Paine placed the bundle on the desk before Woodward and started to open the cloth.\\n\\n \"a moment,\" Matthew said. \"Was that how you originally found the objectsi\"\\n\\n \"The cloth is original, yes.\"\\n\\n \"It was not bound upi\"\\n\\n \"It was just as you see it. and here are the poppets, just as they were.\" He opened the cloth and there were four small figures formed of straw, sticks, and what appeared to be red clay. The poppets were human-shaped, but bore no attempt at facial features; the red clay of their heads was smooth and unmarked. Two of the figures, however, had thin black ribbons tied around the sticks that would represent the human throat. On closer inspection, Woodward saw that the stick-throats had been gashed with a blade.\\n\\n \"I assume those two were meant to be Reverend Grove and Daniel Howarth,\" Paine said. \"The others must have been victims of enchantment, or maybe people who would\u0027ve been murdered had we not captured the witch.\" Rachel made a sound of disgust, but was wise enough to hold her tongue.\\n\\n \"You can deny it all you please!\" Paine turned toward her. \"But I myself found these under a floorboard in your kitchen, madam! Under the very boards that your husband walked upon! Why did you murder himi Because he found you doing witchcrafti Or did he catch you servicing your masteri\"\\n\\n \"If they were hidden in my house, someone else put them there!\" Rachel replied, with considerable heat. \"Maybe you did! Maybe you murdered my husband, too!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he had nothing I wanted!\"\\n\\n \"But he did!\" she said. \"He had me.\"\\n\\n Paine\u0027s face froze with the last vestige of a mocking smile on his mouth.\\n\\n \"I can think of a reason you might have fashioned those poppets and hidden them in my house,\" Rachel went on, her face pressed against the bars and her eyes afire. \"Do you not think I noticed the way you looked at me, when you thought Daniel didn\u0027t seei Do you not think I felt you devouring mei Well, Daniel saw it too! He told me, less than a week before he was murdered, to beware of you because you had a hungry stare and you were not to be trusted! Daniel may have been a stern and quiet man, but he was a very good judge of character!\"\\n\\n \"Obviously he was,\" Paine said. \"He married a witch.\"\\n\\n \"Look at the magistrate,\" Rachel commanded, \"and tell him about your affair with Lucretia Vaughan! Oh, everyone in Fount Royal knows it but Mr. Vaughan, and he knows it too in his heart but he\u0027s too much a mouse to make a squeak! Tell him about your affair with Blessed Pearson, and your dalliance with Mary Summers! Go on, look him in the face and admit it like the man you wish to be!\"\\n\\n Paine did not look at the magistrate. He continued to stare at Rachel even as he let out a laugh that - to Matthew\u0027s ears - sounded a bit strangled. \"You\u0027re not only a damnable witch,\" he said, \"but you\u0027re raving insane as well!\"\\n\\n \"Tell us all why a handsome, healthy man like yourself has never married! Isn\u0027t it because you\u0027re only pleased to possess what belongs to other meni\"\\n\\n \"Now I know you\u0027re insane! I\u0027ve never married because I\u0027ve spent my life in travelling! I also prize freedom, and a man\u0027s freedom is destroyed when he gives it up to a wife!\"\\n\\n \"and while you have no wife, you are free to turn wives into wenches!\" Rachel said. \"Mary Summers was a respectable woman before you got your hands on her, and now where is shei after you killed her husband in that duel, she perished of sorrow within a month!\"\\n\\n \"That duel,\" he answered coldly, \"concerned a point of honor. Quentin Summers splashed wine in my face at the tavern and called me a card cheat. I had no choice but to call him out.\"\\n\\n \"He knew you were having your way with his wife, but he couldn\u0027t catch you! He was a farmer, not a duellist!\"\\n\\n \"Farmer or not, he was given the first shot. He missed. If you\u0027ll recall, I only wounded him in the shoulder.\"\\n\\n \"a bullet wound in this town is a death sentence! He just took longer to die than if you\u0027d shot him through the heart!\"\\n\\n \"The subject of my visit here, I believe, is to display the poppets.\" Paine turned his gaze toward the magistrate. \"Which I have done. Do you wish to keep them, siri\"\\n\\n Even if Woodward\u0027s voice hadn\u0027t been so diminished, it would have been altogether stolen by the accusations and statements that had just flown like wild birds in a storm. It was going to take him a while to absorb all of this, but one thing stood out in clear relief in his mind.\\n\\n He remembered Dr. Shields saying in regards to Paine: He was married, when he was a younger man. His wife perished from an illness that caused her to suffer fits until she died. Why, then, did Paine contend he had never been marriedi\\n\\n \"Magistratei Do you wish to keep the poppetsi\" Paine repeated.\\n\\n \"Oh! Uh . . . yes, I do,\" Woodward answered, in his tortured whisper. \"They shall become the court\u0027s property.\"\\n\\n \"Very well, then.\" He fired a look at Rachel that, were it a can-nonshot, might have cleaved through the hull of a warship. \"I\u0027d beware that one and her nasty tongue, sir! She holds such a grudge against me I\u0027m surprised my murder wasn\u0027t on her list of crimes!\"\\n\\n \"Face the magistrate and deny that what I\u0027ve said is the truth!\" Rachel all but shouted.\\n\\n Woodward had endured enough of this discord. For want of a better instrument, he picked up the Bible and slapped it down against the desk\u0027s edge. \"Hush!\" he said, as loudly as he could; instantly he paid the price in pain, and tears welled up.\\n\\n \"Madam Howarthi\" Matthew said. \"I think it wise to be silent.\"\\n\\n Paine added, \"I think it wise to begin cutting the stake for her execution!\"\\n\\n This sarcastic remark bruised Matthew\u0027s sense of propriety, especially following on the heels of such heated wranglings. His voice tightened. \"Mr. Paine, it would interest me to know if what Madam Howarth claims about you is true.\"\\n\\n \"Would it, nowi\" Paine put his hands on his hips. \"You\u0027re overstepping your bounds, aren\u0027t you, clerki\"\\n\\n \"May I speak for you, siri\" Matthew asked Woodward, and the magistrate didn\u0027t hesitate to nod his assent. \"There, Mr. Paine. My bounds are more clearly defined. Now: are these claims true or falsei\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know I was to be a witness today. I might\u0027ve worn a better suit.\"\\n\\n \"Your delay in answering,\" Matthew said, \"delays the outcome of this trial. Shall you be instructed to sit down and swear truth on the Biblei\"\\n\\n \"You might instruct it, but I doubt you could enforce it.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I\u0027m sure you\u0027re correct. I\u0027m no duellist, either.\"\\n\\n Paine\u0027s face had taken on a reddish cast. \"Listen to me! I didn\u0027t want to fight that man, and if he\u0027d insulted me in private I would have let it go! But he had to test me in public, right there at Van Gundy\u0027s! What could I do but call him outi He had the choice of weapons, and the fool chose pistols instead of blades! I would\u0027ve given him a single cut and called it done!\" He shook his head, his expression taking on a hint of regret. \"But no, Summers wanted heart\u0027s blood. Well, his pistol misfired and the ball hardly rolled out of the muzzle! Still, that was his shot. Then it was mine. I aimed for the meat of his shoulder, which I squarely hit. How would I know he was such a bleederi\"\\n\\n \"You might have fired at the earth,\" Matthew said. \"Isn\u0027t that acceptable when the first shot misfiresi\"\\n\\n \"Not by my rules,\" came the chill reply. \"If a man aims a weapon at me, whether it\u0027s a pistol or a dagger, he must account for it. I\u0027ve been stabbed between the ribs before and shot through my leg; so I hold no sympathy for anyone who tries to do me harm! No matter if he is a farmer!\"\\n\\n \"You suffered these wounds during your career at seai\" Matthew asked.\\n\\n \"The stab, yes. The shot . . . was a later incident.\" He stared at the clerk with fresh interest. \"What do you know of my career at seai\"\\n\\n \"Just that you were a seaman aboard a brigantine. Mr. Bid-well told me. a brigantine is a fast ship, isn\u0027t iti In fact, brigantines are the vessels of choice by pirates, are they noti\"\\n\\n \"They are. and they are also the vessels of choice by those who would hunt pirates in service of the trading companies.\"\\n\\n \"That was your profession, theni\"\\n\\n \"Hardly a profession. I was sixteen years old, hot-tempered and eager to fight. I served one year and four months on a coastal patrol before a black-flagger\u0027s rapier laid me low. That was the end of my saltwater adventures.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" Matthew said quietly. \"I see.\"\\n\\n \"Whati Did you think me a piratei\"\\n\\n \"I wondered.\" Now that the subject had been opened, he had to ask the next question as well: \"Might I inquire . . . who taught you to roll your tobacco in the Spanish fashioni\"\\n\\n \"a Spaniard, of course,\" Paine said. \"a prisoner aboard ship. He had no teeth, but he dearly loved his cigars. I think he was hanged with one in his mouth.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" Matthew repeated. His suspicions concerning the Spanish spy had just fallen to pieces like shattered mirrorglass, and he felt an utter fool.\\n\\n \"all right, I admit it! \" Paine lifted his hands. \"Yes, I have done the things the witch claims, but they were not all my doing! Lucretia Vaughan came after me like a shewolf! I couldn\u0027t walk the street without being near attacked by her! a match can only bear so much friction before it flames, and a single hot blaze is all I gave her! You know how such things happen!\"\\n\\n \"Um ...\" Matthew inspected the tip of his quill. \"Well . . . yes, such things do happen.\"\\n\\n \"and perhaps - perhaps - my eye does wander. I did, at one point, feel an attraction to the witch. Before she was a witch, I mean. You must admit, she\u0027s a handsome piece. Is she noti\"\\n\\n \"My opinion is of no consequence.\" Matthew blushed so furiously that his face hurt.\\n\\n \"You do admit it. You\u0027d have to be blind if you did not. Well,\\n\\n I may have looked in her direction once or twice, but I never laid a hand on her. I had respect for her husband.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d be amazed if you had respect for anyone!\" Rachel said sharply.\\n\\n Paine started to fire off another volley at her, but he checked himself. after a pause in which he stared at the floor, he answered in what was almost a saddened tone, \"You don\u0027t know me very well, madam, even though you imagine you do. I am not the beast you make me out to be. It is my nature to respect only those who respect themselves. as for the others, from them I feel free to take what is offered. Whether that makes me good or bad, I can\u0027t say, but that is how I am.\" He looked at the magistrate and lifted his chin high. \"I did not put those poppets in the witch\u0027s house. I found them, according to a dream related to me by Cara Grunewald. It seems she had a vision - God-sent, if you want my opinion - in which a shining figure told her there was something of importance hidden beneath the floor of Rachel Howarth\u0027s kitchen. We knew not what we were searching for. But there the poppets were, beneath a loosened board.\"\\n\\n \"This was how long after Madam Howarth had been removed from her housei\" Matthew asked.\\n\\n \"Two weeks, I believe. Not any longer.\"\\n\\n \"I presume her house wasn\u0027t guarded or watched in any wayi\"\\n\\n \"No. Why should it have beeni\"\\n\\n \"No reason. But two weeks was time enough for someone else to form the poppets and hide them under the floor, don\u0027t you thinki\"\\n\\n Paine surprised Matthew by giving a short, sharp laugh. \"You\u0027re jesting, of course!\"\\n\\n \"Two weeks,\" Matthew repeated. \"an empty, unguarded house. The poppets are made of common materials. anyone might have placed them there.\"\\n\\n \"Have you lost your senses, clerki No one put them there but the witch herself! You\u0027re forgetting that Madam Grunewald had a divine vision that directed us where to look!\"\\n\\n \"I know nothing of divine visions. I only know two weeks passed and the house was open to all who might want to enter.\"\\n\\n \"No one wanted to enter,\" Paine argued. \"The only reason I and the others who were with me entered is that we had a task to perform. When it was done, we didn\u0027t linger there!\"\\n\\n \"Who discovered the loosened boardi You or someone elsei\"\\n\\n \"I did, and if you like I\u0027ll vow on the Bible that I hadn\u0027t set foot in that house since the morning the witch was taken out of it!\"\\n\\n Matthew glanced at the magistrate. Woodward, who was looking dourly at him, shook his head. Matthew felt he\u0027d come to the end of this particular road. He believed Paine. Why should the man have made the poppets and placed them therei Perhaps it had been a divine vision sent from God to Cara Grunewald; but then again, if he followed that track, he must come to the conclusion that Rachel was indeed performing witchcraft. He sighed heavily and said, \"It\u0027s not necessary that you swear on the Bible, sir. Thank you for your candor in this matter. I believe you may go, if the magistrate desires it.\"\\n\\n \"Go,\" Woodward said.\\n\\n Paine hesitated. \"are you thinking,\" he said to Matthew, \"that someone other than the prisoner might have murdered Reverend Grove and Daniel Howarthi If so, you\u0027d best take care the witch is not casting a spell on your mind this very minute! She did those crimes, and she did the other sins she\u0027s been accused of too. Her ultimate purpose was the destruction of this town, which she nearly did - and still might do, if she\u0027s not soon ashes! Why should it be anyone else\u0027s purposei\"\\n\\n To this question, Matthew had no answer. \"Good afternoon, sir,\" Paine said, addressing the magistrate, and then he turned away and stalked out of the gaol.\\n\\n Woodward watched through hooded eyes as the militia captain left. The magistrate had recalled something else Dr. Shields had said concerning the subject of Paine\u0027s deceased wife: // was a long time ago, and I\u0027m sure Paine wouldn\u0027t care to speak about it. In fact, I know he would not. Had it been such a terrible experience that Paine had decided to deny to the people of Fount Royal that he ever had a wifei and if so, why had he confided it to Dr. Shieldsi It was a small thing, to be sure . . . but still, a point of interest.\\n\\n On Matthew\u0027s mind was the imminent arrival of the final witness, the child Violet adams. He cleaned his quill and prepared a fresh sheet of paper. Rachel returned to her bench and sat down, her head lowered. Woodward closely inspected one of the black-ribboned poppets, after which he closed his eyes and took the opportunity to rest.\\n\\n In a short while the gaol\u0027s door was opened, and Violet adams had arrived. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-17.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \\n Judgment of the Witch \\n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
