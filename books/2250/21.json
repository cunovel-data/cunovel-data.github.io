{"id":85901,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"THE WaRM BaTH - taken in a tub room beside the kitchen - had turned out to be chilly and his shaving razor had nicked his chin, but otherwise Matthew found himself to be invigorated as he dressed in clean clothes. He had consumed a breakfast of eggs, sausage, and salted ham, put away two cups of tea and a jolt of rum, and so was eager to get out and about as the morning progressed.\\n\\n His knock on the magistrate\u0027s door was not answered, but the door was unlatched. When he looked in, he saw Woodward asleep with the box of court papers beside him on the bed. The magistrate had obviously begun reading through them, as there were some papers lying in disarray near his right hand, but his illness had stolen him away. Matthew quietly entered the room and stood at the bedside, staring at Woodward\u0027s pallid yellow-tinged face.\\n\\n The magistrate\u0027s mouth was open. Even in sleep he suffered, for his breathing was a harsh, painful wheeze. Matthew saw the brown stains on the pillowcase under his left ear. The room had a thick, sickly smell, an odor of dried blood and wet pus and . . . deathi Matthew thought.\\n\\n Instantly his mind recoiled. Such a thought should not be allowed. No, no, neither allowed nor dwelt upon! He looked down at the scuffed floorboards for a moment, listening to the magistrate\u0027s struggle with the very air.\\n\\n at the orphanage, Matthew had seen boys grow sick and wither away in such a fashion. He suspected Woodward\u0027s illness might have begun with the cold rain that had pelted them on their flight from Shawcombe\u0027s tavern, the thought of which made him again damn that murderous villain to the innermost fires of Hell. and now Matthew was tormented by worry, because the magistrate\u0027s condition was only likely to worsen if he was not soon gotten back to Charles Town; he presumed Dr. Shields knew what he was doing - he presumed - but by the doctor\u0027s own admission the town of Fount Royal and its cemetery were becoming one and the same. also, Matthew kept thinking about something the magistrate had said concerning Dr. Shields: What prompted him to leave what was probably a well-established urban practise for a task of extreme hardship in a frontier villagei\\n\\n What, indeedi\\n\\n Woodward made a noise, a combination of a whisper and a groan. \u0027ann,\" he said.\\n\\n Matthew lifted his gaze to the man\u0027s face, which appeared fragile as bone china in the light of the room\u0027s single lamp.\\n\\n \"ann,\" Woodward spoke again. His head pressed back against the pillow. \"Ohhhhhh.\" It was an exclamation of heart-wrenching agony. \"... hurting . . . he\u0027s hurting, ann . . . hurting . . .\" The magistrate\u0027s voice dwindled away, and his body relaxed once again as he fell into a deeper and more merciful realm of sleep.\\n\\n Carefully Matthew came around the bed and straightened the papers into a neat stack, which he left within reach of Woodward\u0027s right hand.\\n\\n \"Siri are ye in need of anythin\u0027i\" Matthew looked toward the door. Mrs. Nettles stood on the threshold, and had spoken quietly so as not to disturb the sleeper. He shook his head.\\n\\n \"Very well, sir.\" She started to withdraw, but Matthew said, \"a moment, please,\" and followed her out into the hallway after closing the door behind him.\\n\\n \"Let me say I did not mean to accuse you of stealing my coin,\" he told her. \"I was only pointing out that a woman might have done the job as equally as a man.\"\\n\\n \"You mean, a woman a\u0027 my size, do ye noti\" Mrs. Nettles\u0027s ebony eyes bored holes through him.\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s exactly right.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I did nae steal it, so think what ye please. Now, if you\u0027ll pardon me, I ha\u0027 work to do.\" She turned away and walked toward the stairs.\\n\\n \"as do I,\" Matthew said. \"The work of proving Rachel Howarth innocent.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Nettles halted in her advance. She looked back at him, her face mirroring a confusion of amazement and suspicion.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Matthew assured her. \"I believe Madam Howarth to be innocent and I plan on proving it so.\"\\n\\n \"Proviri iti Howi\"\\n\\n \"It would be improper for me to say, but I thought you might like to know my intentions. Might I now ask you a questioni\" She made no response, but neither did she walk away. \"I doubt much goes on here that escapes your attention,\" he said. \"I\u0027m speaking of Fount Royal as well as this house. You certainly heard the tales concerning Madam Howarth\u0027s supposed witchcraft. Why is it, then, that you so adamantly refused to believe her to be a witch, when the majority of the citizens are convinced she isi\"\\n\\n Mrs. Nettles glanced toward the stairs, marking that no one was close enough to overhear, before she offered a guarded reply. \"I ha\u0027 seen the evil done by misguided men, sir. I saw it takin\u0027 shape here, long ere Mistress Howarth was accused. Oh yes sir, it was a thing waitin\u0027 to happen. after the rev\u0027rend was laid low, it was bound an\u0027 sealed.\"\\n\\n \"You mean that a scapegoat was found for the murderi\"\\n\\n \"aye. Had to be Mistress Howarth, y\u0027see. Had to be someone different - someone who was nae welcomed here. The fact that she\u0027s dark-skinned and near a Spaniard ... it jus\u0027 had to be her accused of such crimes. and whoever murdered the rev\u0027rend killed Mr. Howarth, too, and hid those poppets in the house to make sure Mistress Howarth fell to blame. I nae care what Cara Grunewald said about visions from God and th\u0027 like. She was ha\u0027 crazy and the other ha\u0027 dumb. How the tricks were done, I canna\u0027 say, but there\u0027s a true fox in our coop. Do y\u0027see, siri\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" Matthew said, \"but I\u0027d still like to know why you believe Rachel to be innocent.\"\\n\\n The woman\u0027s mouth was set in a tight, grim line. again, she checked the staircase before she spoke. \"I had an elder sister by the name a\u0027 Jane. She married a man named Merritt and come over here, settled in the town a\u0027 Hampton, in the Massachusetts colony. Jane was a wonderful spinner. She could sit at the wheel and spin most anythin\u0027. She could read the weather by the clouds, and foretold storms by the birds. She took to bein\u0027 a midwife, as well, after Mr. Merritt died of fever. Well, they hanged her in 1680 up there in Hampton, for bein\u0027 a witch an\u0027 spellin\u0027 a woman to give birth to a Devil\u0027s baby. So they said. Jane\u0027s own son - my nephew - was accused of evils and sent to prison in Boston, and he passed away there a year later. I\u0027ve tried to find their graves, but no one knows where they\u0027re lyin\u0027. No one cares where they\u0027re lyin\u0027. You know what my sister\u0027s great sin was, siri\" Matthew said nothing, but simply waited.\\n\\n \"She was different, do y\u0027seei\" Mrs. Nettles said. \"Her readin\u0027 of the clouds, her spinnin\u0027, and her midwifery made her different. In Hampton they put her neck in a noose for it, and when our father read the letters and found out how she\u0027d died, he fell sick too. Our mother and me worked the farm, best we could. He got better, and he lived another four year, but I canna\u0027 say I ever saw him smile ag\u0027in, \u0027cause Jane\u0027s hangin\u0027 was always there in that house. It was always there that she had been killed as a witch, when we all knew she had a sweet, Christian soul. But who was there to defend her, siri Who was there to be her champion of justicei\" She shook her head, a bitter smile pinching her mouth.\\n\\n \"Nae, not a single man nor woman stood up for her, for they must\u0027a feared the same thing as we fear in this town: anyone who speaks up in defense must be also bewitched and fit for the hangin\u0027 tree. Yes sir, he knows that, too.\" Mrs. Nettles again stared through Matthew with fierce intensity. \"The fox, I mean. He knows what happened in Salem, and in a dozen other towns. No one\u0027s gonna speak out for Mistress Howarth, for fear of their own necks. They\u0027d rather quit this town and drag a guilty shadow. I\u0027d quit it m\u0027self, if I had the courage to turn my back on Mr. Bidwell\u0027s coin . . . but 1 do not, and so there you have it.\"\\n\\n \"The witnesses insist that what they\u0027ve seen is neither dream nor phantasm,\" Matthew said. \"How would you account for thati\"\\n\\n \"If I could account for it - and could prove it - I would make sure it was brought to Mr. Bidwell\u0027s attention.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly what I\u0027m trying to do. I understand that Rachel was not well liked here, and was forced away from the church, but can you think of anyone who might have held such a grudge against her that they would wish to paint her as a witchi\"\\n\\n \"No sir, I canna\u0027. as I say, there were plenty who disliked her for bein\u0027 dark and near Spaniard. Disliked her for bein\u0027 a handsome woman, too. But no one I can think of who had that much hate in \u0027em.\"\\n\\n \"What about Mr. Howarthi\" Matthew asked. \"Did he have enemiesi\"\\n\\n \"a few, but as far as I know they\u0027ve all either died or left town.\"\\n\\n \"and Reverend Grovei Did anyone display ill feelings toward himi\"\\n\\n \"No one,\" Mrs. Nettles said flatly. \"The rev\u0027rend and his wife were fine people. He was a smart man, too. If he was still alive, he\u0027d be the first to defend Mistress Howarth and that\u0027s the truth.\"\\n\\n \"I wish he were alive. I\u0027d much rather Reverend Grove calm the crowd than Exodus Jerusalem work them into a frenzy.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, he\u0027s a right loose cannon,\" Mrs. Nettles agreed. \"May I ask if I should set a plate for you at the midday meali\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not necessary. I have some places to go. But would you please look in on the magistrate from time to timei\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\" She glanced quickly toward the closed door. \"I\u0027m feared he\u0027s doin\u0027 poorly.\"\\n\\n \"I know. all I can hope is that Dr. Shields tends him adequately until we can return to Charles Town, and that he doesn\u0027t grow any worse.\"\\n\\n \"I ha\u0027 seen this sickness before, sir,\" she said, after which she was silent but Matthew grasped what was left unspoken.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll return in the afternoon,\" he told her, and then he walked by Mrs. Nettles and descended the stairs.\\n\\n The day continued gloomy, befitting Matthew\u0027s state of mind. He trudged past the spring on his way to the conjunction of streets, where he turned west onto Industry. a sharp eye had to be kept ready for the blacksmith, but Matthew put Hazelton\u0027s property behind him without incident. He did, however, receive a generous spattering of mud from the wheels of a wagon that creaked past, freighted with the belongings of a family - father, mother, three small children - who evidently had chosen this as the day to abandon Fount Royal.\\n\\n Indeed, the town under this murky gray sky appeared all but deserted, with only a few citizens in evidence. Matthew saw on both sides of Industry Street the fallow fields and forlorn dwellings that were the results of wretched weather, ill fate, and the fear of witchcraft. It seemed to him that the further he ventured along Industry, in the direction of the orchards and farmland that should have been the pride of Fount Royal, the worse became the sense of desolation and futility. Piles of animal manure littered the street, among them more than a few nuggets of human waste as well. Matthew saw the wagon and campsite of Exodus Jerusalem but the preacher was not in view. When Matthew came upon the carcass of a pig, its bulk having been gnawed open and the innards being ravaged by a couple of desperate-looking mongrels, he thought that the days of Fount Royal were numbered - no matter what Bidwell did to save the place - simply because the lethargy of the doomed had settled here like a funeral shroud.\\n\\n He did spy an elderly man who was outside his barn lathering a saddle, and from him he inquired as to the home of Martin adams. \"House is up the way. Got blue shutters,\" the aged gent answered. Then, \"Seen you take the lash this mornin\u0027. You done good not to holler. When\u0027s that witch gonna burni\"\\n\\n \"The magistrate is debating,\" Matthew said, starting to move along.\\n\\n \"Hope it\u0027s in a day or two. I\u0027ll be there, you can mark it!\"\\n\\n Matthew kept going. The very next house - whitewashed but losing its paint in large, ugly splotches - looked to be long vacant and its front door was partway open but all the shutters sealed. Matthew suspected this was the Hamilton place, where Violet had experienced her encounter. Three more houses, and there stood the one with blue shutters. He walked to the door and knocked.\\n\\n When the door was opened, Violet herself stood before him. Her eyes widened and she started to retreat but Matthew said, \"Hello, Violet. May I speak with youi\"\\n\\n \"No sir,\" she said, obviously overcome by his presence and the memory it stirred. \"I have to go, sir.\" She made a motion to close the door in his face.\\n\\n \"Please.\" Matthew put his hand against the door. \"Just one moment.\"\\n\\n \"Who is thati\" came a woman\u0027s rather shrill voice from within. \"Violet, who\u0027s therei\"\\n\\n \"The man who asked me questions, Mama!\" almost at once Violet was pulled aside none too gently and a woman who was as thin and rawboned as her husband stepped upon the threshold. Constance adams wore a drab brown dress and white bonnet, a stained and frayed apron, and held a broom. She was older than her husband, possibly in her late thirties, and might have been a handsome woman but for the length of her pointed chin and the unrestrained anger in her pale blue eyes.\\n\\n \"What do you wanti\" she snapped, as if biting off a piece of beef jerky.\\n\\n \"Pardon my intrusion,\" he said. \"I wanted to ask your daughter another question pertaining to - \"\\n\\n \"No,\" she interrupted. \"Violet\u0027s answered enough questions.\\n\\n That woman is a curse and a plague on us, and I wish her dead. Now go away!\"\\n\\n Matthew kept his hand on the door. \"One question,\" he said firmly. He saw the little girl standing behind her mother, about to bolt like a scared deer. \"Violet told me that in the Hamilton house she heard the voice of a man singing. I asked her to think about it further, and try to remember what she heard.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re painin\u0027 her, don\u0027t you see thati all these questions are like to make her head split open, she\u0027s hurtin\u0027 so bad!\"\\n\\n \"Mamai\" Violet said, close to tears. \"Don\u0027t yell, Mama!\"\\n\\n \"Hush!\" The woman laid the broom\u0027s handle against Matthew\u0027s chest. \"Violet can\u0027t sleep at night, her head aches so! Dr. Shields can\u0027t even help her! all this thinkin\u0027 and remem-berin\u0027 of such evil things is drivin\u0027 us all to madness!\"\\n\\n \"I can understand your difficulty, but I have to - \"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to do nothin\u0027 but turn around and go!\" she said, all but shouting. \"If the witch had been put to death three month past, this town would be all right, but look at it now! She\u0027s near killed it, just like she killed the reverend and her own husband! Just like she\u0027s killed Sarah Davis and James Lathrop, Giles Geddy and Dorcas Chester and all the rest of \u0027em laid down in them graves! and now she\u0027s tryin\u0027 to kill my Violet by a knife to the brains!\" Spittle had spewed from the woman\u0027s mouth and glistened on her chin. The expression in her eyes, wild to begin with, now had taken on a frightening fever. \"I told \u0027em she was no good! I told \u0027em all along, but they didn\u0027t care to hear me! No, they let her walk in that church, just walk in and her a black nigger from Hell!\"\\n\\n \"Mama! Mama!\" Violet was crying, and had clasped her hands to her ears.\\n\\n \"She will damn us all before she\u0027s done!\" Constance adams continued to rave, her voice now risen to a dreadful, piercing pitch. \"I\u0027ve begged him to leave! By Christ I\u0027ve begged him, but he says we ain\u0027t runnin\u0027! She\u0027s tainted his mind, too, and she\u0027ll have him dead a\u0027fore long!\"\\n\\n Matthew presumed she meant her husband. It was obvious that the woman was in danger of losing her last tattered rag of sanity. and obvious as well that no good was being done here. He backed away from the door as the distraught wretch went on jabbering, \"She killed Phillip Beale! Choked him on blood in his sleep! I told \u0027em to run her out of this town! I told \u0027em she was evil, and abby Hamilton knew it too! Lord God protect and save us! Burn her, for the love of almighty God, burn her!\" The door slammed shut, and from beyond it Matthew heard Constance adams wailing like an injured, terrified animal caught in a cage.\\n\\n He turned around and walked away from the house, going eastward along Industry Street. His heart was pounding, his stomach seemingly twisted into a knot by his encounter with the madwoman. He understood, though, the power of fear to distort and destroy. Perhaps Constance adams had been long balanced on a precarious edge, and this situation had pushed her over. In any case, he could expect no further help from woman or child. This he found extremely unfortunate, because the matter of a man\u0027s singing voice in the demon-inhabited Hamilton house was so strange that he felt it might have great bearing on the truth.\\n\\n In a few moments he came once again to the house itself. There was nothing particularly forbidding about it, other than the fact that it had the air of abandonment, but Matthew thought that on this grim day it was like an ugly fist clenched around a secret. It was made of the same pine timbers as the other houses and was the same small size - two or three rooms, at the most - yet this house was indeed different for it had been chosen, if one believed the child, as the site of Satan\u0027s warning against the citizens of Fount Royal.\\n\\n He decided to see the interior for himself, and particularly find the back room from whence the man\u0027s voice had come. The door was already open wide enough to admit him, and Matthew recalled Violet saying that the door was open when she entered as well. He doubted that anyone had set foot here since the child\u0027s experience, and so he thought there might be some evidence of interest. Possibly the imp\u0027s candle, or the chair upon which Satan had been sittingi\\n\\n Matthew approached the door, not without some trepidation. Because all the shutters were closed, the interior was as dark as the gaol at midnight. He was greeted at the threshold by a damp, putrid, altogether unsavory odor. He called on the sternest stuff he had and entered the house.\\n\\n His first task was to make his way to the nearest window and open the shutters wide, which he did. Now, with the aid of feeble though welcome light, his courage grew. He went to the other window and opened those shutters also, allowing God\u0027s illumination into the refuge of Satan.\\n\\n When he turned to survey the room in which he stood, there were three things he noted in rapid succession: the Hamil-tons had evidently carried everything away in a wagon, for there was not a stick of furniture remaining; the floor was littered with what appeared to be dog droppings, some of them relatively fresh; and a skeleton lay in the corner.\\n\\n The skeleton, of course, secured his attention. Matthew approached it for a closer inspection.\\n\\n It had been at one time a medium-sized dog, obviously aged because its teeth were so worn down. The skeleton lay on its right side on a mat of its own grayish-brown hair, its bones picked clean by the flies that even now buzzed around the fresher mounds of excrement. The smell in this corner of the room was not pleasant, as the boards beneath the dead animal had been stained by the liquids of decay. Matthew wondered how long this carcass had been lying here, being whittled down to its foundations by scavenging insects.\\n\\n He remembered what Martin adams had said before Violet had related her story: This thing she is \u0027bout to tell you happent near three week ago.\\n\\n Surely, to have been so completely consumed, the dead dog had been lying in this room for at least that long, he thought. The smell must have been sickening. It must have struck a person in the face as soon as that threshold was crossed, and indeed must have been quite apparent even before the entry was reached. Yet it had not stopped Violet adams from entering the house, and indeed she\u0027d not noticed it even when she was well within.\\n\\n One might say the Devil had masked the odor, or that Violet had been too entranced to let it wrinkle her nose, but still ... Of course, the dog could have died here two weeks ago rather than three. But still. . .\\n\\n Matthew turned his mind to the fact that there were no furnishings in the room. No chair, no bench, nothing upon which the Devil might have been sitting with the imp upon his knee. Of course Satan might have conjured a chair from thin air, but still. . .\\n\\n He heard a noise from the rear of the house.\\n\\n It was a slight sound, just a whisper of a noise, but it was enough to make the small hairs stir on the back of his neck. He stood very still, his mouth gone dry. He stared into the darkness that held reign back there, beyond the spill of meager light.\\n\\n The sound - whatever it was - was not repeated. Matthew thought it had been the creaking of a board, or the slow shifting of something that would not be seen. He waited, his hands clenched into fists at his sides, his eyes trying to pierce the gloom. a fly landed on his forehead, and he quickly brushed it away.\\n\\n The room back there. From where the child had said she\u0027d heard a man\u0027s voice, singing.\\n\\n Matthew was terrified by the thought of what might be lurking just beyond his range of vision. Or, indeed, lying in wait for him. But, God help him, he had come to this house to ascertain the truth and therefore he must go back into that dark room, for who would go if he would noti\\n\\n Still, his feet had grown roots. He looked around for a weapon of some kind - of any kind - but found nothing. No, that was not quite correct: amid the ashes of the hearth he saw two items that had been left by the Hamiltons - a broken clay tankard and a small iron cooking pot. He picked up the pot, which had been so used its bottom was burned black, and again faced the gathered dark.\\n\\n Matthew would have traded two teeth for a sword and a lantern, but a cooking pot was at least substantial enough to strike a blow with, if need be. He sincerely hoped there would be no need. and now came the test of his own mettle. To go or not to go, that was the question. If he slinked out, would it not be an admittance that the Devil really might be back in that room awaiting himi and had he heard a noise, or had it been only his fevered imaginationi\\n\\n It could have been a rat, of course. Yes, a rat. That was all.\\n\\n He took one step toward the dark and stopped, listening. There was no sound other than the pounding of his heartbeat in his ears. One more step, and then another. He could now make out an open doorway, beyond which might have been a bottomless pit.\\n\\n Slowly, slowly, Matthew approached the room and winced as his weight made a board groan. He peered inside, all his senses alert for any hint of motion or threat of attack from a spectral fiend. He saw the barest crack of daylight back there: the seam of closed shutters.\\n\\n again his courage faltered. To have a view of the room meant he must cross it and unlatch the shutters. a cold hand might grip the back of his neck before he could get there.\\n\\n No, it was ridiculous! he thought. His very reticence here was giving weight to the notion - absurd, in his belief - that indeed Satan had visited this house and might still be a presence in its darkness. The longer he tarried on the threshold, the more claws and teeth Satan bared. There was nothing to do but enter the room, go straight to the shutters, and throw them open.\\n\\n and, of course, while doing so keep a tight grip on the iron pot.\\n\\n Matthew took as much of a deep breath as he could stand, as the smell was less than fragrant. Then he gritted his teeth and walked into the room.\\n\\n He felt the darkness take him. His spine crawling, he went the ten feet or so to the opposite wall, found the shutter latch, and lifted it with a quick - one might say frantic - motion. as he opened the shutters the blessed gray light rushed in, and never had he been so glad to see a skyful of ugly clouds.\\n\\n at the instant of Matthew\u0027s relief, a groan came from behind him that rose in volume and power and quite near sent him hurtling through the window. This sound of a vengeful demon all but lifted Matthew out of his shoes. He twisted around with his face frozen into a terrified rictus and the iron pot lifted to strike a blow against a horned skull.\\n\\n It was difficult to say who was more frightened, the wild-eyed young man or the wild-eyed brown mongrel that cowered in a corner. But it was definitely Matthew\u0027s fear that passed first, as directly he saw on the floor the six pups that had been suckling at their mother\u0027s swollen teats. He gave a reflexive, strangled laugh, though his testicles were yet to descend from the height they had risen.\\n\\n The bitch was trembling, but now she began to show her teeth and mutter a growl, therefore Matthew felt it prudent to take his leave. He had a look around the room, which was quite bare except for the animals, their excrement, and a couple of tattered chicken carcasses. He lowered the cooking pot and backed out, and was on his way to the door when the master of the house suddenly arrived.\\n\\n It was one of the dogs that had been pulling the entrails from the dead pig in the street. It came in bloody-mouthed, carrying between its jaws a hunk of something dark red and dripping. as soon as its glinting eyes took sight of Matthew, the animal dropped its gory prize and crouched down in an attitude of attack, its husky growl indicating that Matthew had intruded upon a territory off-limits to the humans of Fount Royal. The beast was about to jump for Matthew\u0027s throat, that much was dangerously clear. Matthew wasted no time in making his decision; he flung the pot to the floor in front of the dog, causing it to leap backward and issue a fusillade of indignant barks, and then he immediately turned to the nearest window, climbed up over the sill, and jumped out.\\n\\n Up on his feet again, he made haste in an easterly direction.\\n\\n He glanced back, but the dog did not follow. Matthew kept his pace brisk until he\u0027d left the Hamilton house well in his wake, and then he stopped to take account of a scraped right shin and a number of splinters in the palm of his right hand. Otherwise, he was none the worse for his venture.\\n\\n as he continued to walk toward the conjunction of streets, he reflected on the meaning of this experience. Possibly the dogs had belonged to the Hamiltons and had been left behind months ago, or possibly they were curs abandoned by some other fleeing family. The question was: how long had the dogs been living therei More or less than three weeksi Was it reasonable to assume they had been there when Violet adams had entered the housei\\n\\n If she had entered the house. There had been no chair. No candle or candlestick. Bidwell and Exodus Jerusalem would say that those items had been spectral and of course had vanished with the demons, but Matthew needed to see them to believe they had been there at all. and what of the dog\u0027s skeletoni The decaying carcass would have filled that room with a repulsive odor, yet Violet had not noticed it nor been hesitant in entering the house. Matthew doubted very much if he would have gone into a deserted house that had the smell of death wafting from its front door, no matter who\u0027d been calling to him. Therefore, what to make of the child\u0027s testimonyi\\n\\n Had she really been in there, or noti The strangest thing about this was that, as far as he could tell, Violet - like Buckner and Garrick - was not lying. She fervently - and fearfully - believed in the truth of what she\u0027d witnessed. It was her truth, perhaps, just as what had happened to Buckner and Garrick were truths to them . . . but was it the whole and actual truthi\\n\\n But what kind of truth was it, that might be both true and false at the same timei\\n\\n He felt he was venturing onto philosophical ground, worthy of intense thought and debate yet not very helpful to Rachel\u0027s cause. He\u0027d been planning on asking directions to Dr. Shields\u0027s infirmary, in order to more thoroughly understand the magistrate\u0027s illness, but somehow he did not approach the next person he saw, which was a man mending a wagon\u0027s wheel, nor did he approach the next two men who were standing together smoking pipes and conversing. Perhaps he didn\u0027t wish to answer questions concerning the magistrate\u0027s health or the fate of the witch, but in any case he kept walking from Industry Street onto Truth Street and therefore in the direction of where he knew he\u0027d been heading all along: the gaol.\\n\\n The door was still left unsecured. The sight of the pillory standing beside the gaol did nothing for his fond memories of this morning, yet he realized - and would be loath to admit it to anyone, especially Bidwell or the magistrate - that he missed Rachel\u0027s presence. and why was thati He asked himself that question, as he stood just outside the door.\\n\\n Because she needed him. That was it, in an acorn\u0027s shell.\\n\\n He went inside. a lantern burned and the roof\u0027s hatch had been opened, courtesy of Mr. Green, therefore the gloom had been somewhat conquered. Upon seeing who her visitor was, Rachel stood up from the bench and pushed the hood of her coarse cloak back from her face. She allowed as much of a smile as she was able to muster - so feeble it was hardly worth the effort - and she came to the bars to meet him.\\n\\n He approached her cell. He didn\u0027t know what to say, didn\u0027t know how to explain his return. So he was relieved when Rachel spoke first, \"I heard the whip strike. are you all righti\"\\n\\n \"I am.\"\\n\\n \"It sounded painful.\"\\n\\n He felt suddenly very shy in her company. He didn\u0027t know whether to look at the floor or into Rachel\u0027s eyes, which caught the yellow lamplight and gleamed like gold coins. Though her smile had been weak, her eyes still held remarkable strength, and Matthew had the sensation that she could see through his frame of flesh and bones, into the depths of his guarded soul. He shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other. What she might see there, he knew, was his own desire to be needed, which had always been true in his relationship with the magistrate but was now a bright, hot bonfire. It was that he had seen her naked, he thought: not the moment of her being physically unclothed, but the moment in which she had exposed her own need and reached for his hand through the bars to seek comfort.\\n\\n He\u0027d realized he was all the hope she had left in the world. Whatever aid and comfort would be given to her for the rest of her short days, it would come from him. How could he banish her from his mind and souli Woodward was in dire need as well, but he had the care of Dr. Shields. This woman - this beautiful, tragic woman standing before him - had no one on earth to care for her but himself.\\n\\n \"Has Green brought your meal yeti\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve just now finished it.\"\\n\\n \"Do you need fresh wateri I could go fetch you some.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she said. \"I have enough water. But thank you.\"\\n\\n Matthew looked around at the dirty hovel. \"This place should be swept out and fresh straw laid down. It\u0027s abysmal that you should have to endure such filth.\"\\n\\n \"I imagine it\u0027s a late hour for that,\" she replied. \"May I ask how goes the magistrate\u0027s deliberationsi\"\\n\\n \"He has issued no word yet.\"\\n\\n \"I know there can be no other decree but that of guilty,\" she said. \"The evidence against me is too strong, particularly after what the child said. I know also I didn\u0027t help myself by violating the Bible, but I lost my senses. So . . . Bidwell will have his witch-burning before long.\" There was pain in her face, but she lifted her chin. \"When the time comes, I shall be ready. I will have made my preparations. When I am led out of this place I will be glad, because I know that though I am banished from earth I shall be received in Heaven.\"\\n\\n Matthew started to protest her surrender, but words failed him.\\n\\n \"I am very, very tired,\" Rachel said quietly. She pressed the fingers of her right hand to her forehead and closed her eyes for a few seconds. \"I will be ready to fly this cage,\" she said. \"I did love my husband. But I have so long felt alone . . . that death must be better.\" Her eyes opened, and she lowered her hand. \"Will you attend iti\"\\n\\n Matthew realized what she meant. \"No,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Will I be buried near my husbandi Or somewhere elsei\"\\n\\n There was no use in telling her anything but the truth. \"Probably outside the town.\"\\n\\n \"I thought as much. They won\u0027t behead me, will theyi I mean . . . after I\u0027m burned, will my body be violatedi\"\\n\\n \"No.\" He would make sure not even a fingerbone was cleaved off to be shown for two pence at Van Gundy\u0027s tavern. Of course, what some graverobber did to her skeleton after he and Woodward had departed was beyond his control and beyond his wish to think about.\\n\\n Rachel\u0027s expression of concern told Matthew this thought had entered her mind as well, but she didn\u0027t give it voice. She said, \"I\u0027ll have only one regret: that whoever murdered Daniel and Reverend Grove will never be brought to justice. That\u0027s not fair, is iti\"\\n\\n \"No, it certainly is not.\"\\n\\n \"But by then I won\u0027t care, will Ii\" She looked up at the clouded sky through the roof hatch. \"I thought - I hoped - I would die of old age, in bed in my own home. I never dreamed my life would end like this, and that I\u0027d not even be allowed to lie beside my husband! That\u0027s not fair either, is iti\" She breathed in and let go a long sigh, and finally she lowered her gaze, her mouth drawn into a tight line.\\n\\n The gaol\u0027s door opened, and instantly upon seeing who had arrived Rachel stepped back from the bars.\\n\\n \"ah ha!\" Exodus Jerusalem tilted his head to one side, smiling slyly. \"What doth go on herei\"\\n\\n Matthew turned to confront him. \"May I ask what your business isi\"\\n\\n \"Whatever I do, wherever I goeth, \u0027tis the business of my Lord God.\" Jerusalem, clad in his black tricorn and black suit, came forward within an arm\u0027s length of Matthew. \"I should wager thy business doth not be so holy.\"\\n\\n \"Your presence is not wanted here, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I am sure of that. But I hath come to speak to the witch, not to her cock-a-doodler.\"\\n\\n Matthew felt the blood burn in his cheeks. \"I don\u0027t think Madam Howarth has anything to say to you.\"\\n\\n \"She might, as without my influence her tongue should be forever silent.\" The preacher directed his next statement to Rachel: \"Witch Howarth, thy hourglass is near empty. I have heard it said the tree hath been selected from which thy stake shall be cut. Even now, the axes are being sharpened. I sincerely hope thou hast given some thought to the offer I made thee on my last visit.\"\\n\\n \"What, the offer to be your travelling doxyi\" Rachel asked sharply.\\n\\n \"To be my travelling disciple,\" he answered, his voice a smooth adagio, so leisurely that Matthew felt sure Jerusalem had proposed this arrangement so many times it was second nature. Or perhaps first nature. \"and companion in study and prayer,\" Jerusalem added.\\n\\n \"The study of sin and prayer that you find another woman whom you can pluck from a gaoli\" On Rachel\u0027s face was an expression of sheer disgust that might have curdled a pail of milk. \"I would rather kiss the flames.\"\\n\\n \"Thy wish shall become reality,\" Jerusalem said. \"and thy dark beauty shall be burnt from thy skull and crushed beneath the foot of God, and where thou dost lie the beasts shall come and tear thy very bones asunder.\"\\n\\n The anger was rising up in Matthew like a floodtide. \"I wish you to leave.\"\\n\\n \"Boy, this a public place, and I have just as much right to enter it as thyself.\" His eyes narrowed. \"at least I entered here to bring salvation to the witch, not to receive her vile blessings.\"\\n\\n \"Madam Howarth and I are both aware of your purpose.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, thou and the witch are coupled now, is that iti Yes, I knew it was only a matter of time.\" He lifted his right hand and inspected his fingernails. \"I hath seen witches at work before. I hath seen them promise all manner of pleasures to young boys. Tell me this, then: how did she propose thou should ride heri From the north or the southi\"\\n\\n Matthew swung at him. It was so fast he hardly knew what he was doing, but the blood roared in his ears and his right fist came up and cracked across the preacher\u0027s prominent jaw. Jerusalem staggered back two steps but found his balance; he blinked, touched his lower lip, and then regarded the smear of crimson on his fingertips. Instead of offering a wounded and angry countenance, as Matthew had thought he would, the preacher only smiled, but there was some wicked triumph in it. \"Thou nicked me, boy. Yet I think I drew first blood.\"\\n\\n \"I should apologize, but I will not.\" Matthew rubbed his stinging knuckles.\\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t apologize! This action speaks for itself, and therefore should be reported to thy master.\"\\n\\n \"as you please. The magistrate trusts my judgment.\"\\n\\n \"Reallyi\" Jerusalem\u0027s smile broadened. He licked his injured lip. \"What shall Woodward say, upon report that his clerk was caught in intimate conversation with the witch, and that his clerk is so bewildered in the mind that he hath struck a proper man of Godi and look here! \u0027Tis the damage to prove it!\"\\n\\n \"Tell what you like, then.\" Matthew feigned indifference, but he knew this would not go over very well with the magistrate.\\n\\n \"When a right Christian boy is entranced by a witch, who knoweth where such actions may leadi Thou may find thyself sharing the fire with her, and thereafter thou may fornicate in Hell to thy eternal delight.\"\\n\\n Matthew shouted, \"Get out! By God, I\u0027ll strike you again!\"\\n\\n \"and blasphemous as well!\" Jerusalem crowed. \"This is a sorry day for thee, that I can promise!\" His gaze slid toward Rachel. \"Then burn, witch!\" His voice, at the fullest of its power, seemed to shake the walls. \"I offered thee salvation, and thou hast spurned the last hope of a Godly life! Yes, burn, and call upon me with thy last tortured breath but thou - \"\\n\\n Rachel reached to the floor. \"Move!\" she told Matthew, who saw what she had picked up and so dodged the oncoming deluge.\\n\\n \" - shall call in vain, for Exodus Jerusalem shall not ans - ohhhhh!\" he bellowed, as Rachel threw the contents of her waste bucket through the bars at him, and he danced backward to avoid as much as possible a meeting between the sacred and the profane. For the most part he was lucky, but his shoes received a washing.\\n\\n Matthew couldn\u0027t help it; he burst out laughing at the preacher\u0027s whirligigging, and thus called upon himself Jerusalem\u0027s blackest regards.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be damned too, you young bastard!\" It was amazing how a bucket of pee could knock the thees and thous out of a man. \"I\u0027ll call the wrath of Heaven down on both your heads!\"\\n\\n \"Call away, then!\" Rachel said. \"But do it somewhere else!\"\\n\\n Matthew was still grinning. Then he saw a fleeting look in Jerusalem\u0027s eyes that should only be described as terror; in that moment he realized that ridicule was the sharpest sword that could pierce the preacher\u0027s swollen pride, and thereafter Jerusalem spun around and fled the gaol like a cat with a burning tail.\\n\\n Rachel threw the emptied bucket aside and viewed the wet floor. \"Mr. Green will have a few choice words to say about this, I\u0027m sure.\"\\n\\n Matthew\u0027s grin faded away, as did the hilarity that had for a brief time lightened his soul. \"I\u0027ll tell the magistrate what happened.\"\\n\\n \"Jerusalem will be there before you.\" She sank down on her bench. \"You will have some explaining to do.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\\n\\n \"The magistrate won\u0027t understand why you came here. I don\u0027t fully understand why, either.\"\\n\\n \"I wished to see you,\" he said, before he could ponder his choice of words.\\n\\n \"Whyi Your business is finished here, is it noti\"\\n\\n \"Magistrate Woodward\u0027s business is finished,\" he corrected. \"I intend to continue working at this puzzle.\"\\n\\n \"I see. Is that what I\u0027ve become, theni a puzzle to be worked ati\"\\n\\n \"Not entirely.\"\\n\\n Rachel looked at him, but said nothing for a stretch of time. Then she spoke in a quiet voice, \"are you becoming interested in mei\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" He had to pause to swallow. \"In your situation, I mean to say.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not speaking of my situation, Matthew. I mean: are you interested in mei\" He didn\u0027t know what to say, therefore he did not answer.\\n\\n Rachel sighed and stared at the floor. \"I am flattered,\" she said. \"Honestly. You are a bright and kind young man. But . . . though you\u0027re twenty and I am twenty-six, I am fifty years older than you. My heart is used up, Matthew. Can you understand thati\"\\n\\n again, words failed him. He had never in his life felt so confused, timid, and utterly strange, as if his powers of self-control had melted away like a lump of butter set on a forge. He might have preferred three more lashes than wearing this simpleton\u0027s suit.\\n\\n \"as I said, I will be ready to die when the time comes,\" Rachel continued. \"It will come soon, I know. I thank you for your help and care . . . but please don\u0027t make my death any more difficult than it has to be.\" She sat for a moment, her hands clasped together in her lap, and then she lifted her head. \"How is the magistrate\u0027s healthi\"\\n\\n Matthew forced himself to speak. \"Not well. I was on my way to see Dr. Shields. Where is the infirmary from herei\"\\n\\n \"On Harmony Street, toward the gate.\"\\n\\n Matthew knew it was time to go. His presence seemed to be sinking Rachel into deeper gloom. \"I won\u0027t give up,\" he vowed.\\n\\n \"Give what upi\"\\n\\n \"Trying to find an answer. To the puzzle. I won\u0027t give up, because . . .\" He shrugged. \"I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" she replied. \"I think - if you ever do find an answer - it will come much too late to save my life, but I thank you just the same.\"\\n\\n He went to the door, where he felt the need to look back at Rachel once again. He saw her lift her hood over her head and face, as if to block out everything possible of this treacherous world.\\n\\n \"Goodbye,\" he said. There was no response. He left the gaol, but he had the most compelling sensation that part of himself did not follow. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-21.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \\n Judgment of the Witch \\n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
