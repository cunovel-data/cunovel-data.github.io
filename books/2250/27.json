{"id":85907,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"THE MaGISTRaTE HaS MaDE HIS DECREE, \" Matthew said. Rachel, who was sitting on her bench with the coarse robe around her and the cowl shielding her face, hadn\u0027t moved when Matthew and Bidwell entered the gaol. Now she simply gave a brief nod, signifying her acknowledgment of the document that was about to be read.\\n\\n \"Go on, let\u0027s hear it!\" Bidwell had been in such a hurry that he\u0027d demanded they walk instead of waiting for the horses and carriage to be readied, and now he was truly champing at his bit.\\n\\n Matthew stood beneath the roof hatch, which was open. He unrolled the document and began to read the preface in a calm, emotionless voice. Behind him, Bidwell paced back and forth. The master of Fount Royal abruptly stopped when Matthew reached the portion that began: \"On the Charge of the Murder of the Reverend Burlton Grove...\" Matthew could hear the man\u0027s wolfish breathing at his back. \"I Find the aforesaid Defendant Guilty.\"\\n\\n There was a smack as Bidwell struck his palm with his fist in a gesture of triumph. Matthew flinched, but kept his attention focused on Rachel. She showed no reaction whatsoever. \"With a Stipulation, \" Matthew continued. \"That the Defendant Did Not actually Commit the Murder, But Caused It to be Committed by Her Words, Deeds, or associations.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but it\u0027s all the same, isn\u0027t iti\" Bidwell crowed. \"She might as well have done it with her own hands!\"\\n\\n Matthew kept going by sheer force of will. \"On the Charge of the Murder of Daniel Howarth, I Find the aforesaid Defendant Guilty, With a Stipulation.\" at the word guilty, this time Rachel had given a soft cry and lowered her head. \"That the Defendant Did Not actually Commit the Murder, But Caused It to be Committed by Her Words, Deeds, or associations.\"\\n\\n \"Excellent, excellent!\" Bidwell gleefully clapped his hands together.\\n\\n Matthew looked fiercely into the man\u0027s grinning face. \"Would you please restrain yourselfi This is not a five-pence play requiring comments from the idiots\u0027 gallery!\"\\n\\n Bidwell\u0027s grin only broadened. \"Oh, say what you like! Just keep reading that blessed decree!\"\\n\\n Matthew\u0027s task - performed so many times at the magistrate\u0027s behest over criminals common and extraordinary - had become a test of endurance. He had to go on.\\n\\n \"On the Charge of Witchcraft, \" he read to Rachel, \"I Find the aforesaid Defendant...\" and here his throat almost clenched shut to prevent him from speaking, but the horrible word had to be uttered, \"... Guilty.\"\\n\\n \"ah, sweet deliverance!\" Bidwell all but shouted.\\n\\n Rachel made no sound, but she put a trembling hand to her cowl-shrouded face as if the word - which she had known would be delivered - had been a physical blow.\\n\\n \"By Virtue of the Power ascribed to Me as Colonial Magistrate, \" Matthew read, \"I Hereby Sentence the aforesaid Defendant Rachel Howarth to Burning at the Stake as Warranted by the King\u0027s Law. The Sentence to be Carried Out on Monday, the Twenty-Second of May, Sixteen-Ninety-Nine.\" When the distasteful chore was finished, he dropped the document down by his side.\\n\\n \"Your hours are numbered!\" Bidwell said, standing behind Matthew. \"Your master may have torched the schoolhouse last night, but we\u0027ll build it back!\"\\n\\n \"I think you should leave, \" Matthew told him, though he was too drained to raise his voice.\\n\\n \"You may go to your reward knowing that all your work to destroy my town was for nothing!\" Bidwell raved on. \"Once you\u0027re dead, Fount Royal shall rise to fame and glory!\"\\n\\n Rachel gave no response to these cutting comments, if indeed she felt them through her sphere of misery.\\n\\n Still Bidwell wasn\u0027t done. \"This is truly the day that God made!\" He couldn\u0027t help it; he had to reach out and clap Matthew on the back. \"a fine job you and the magistrate have done! and an excellent decision! Now... I must go start the preparations! There\u0027s a stake to be cut, and by Christ\u0027s blood it\u0027ll be the best stake any damned witch was ever burned on!\" He glared at Rachel through the bars. \"Your master may send every demon in his barn to cause us woe between now and Monday morn, but we\u0027ll weather it! You may rely on that, witch! So tell your black-cocked dog that Robert Bidwell never failed at anything in his life and Fount Royal will be no exception! Do you hear mei\" He was no longer speaking directly to Rachel now but was looking around the gaol, his voice thunderous and haughty as if he were sending a warning to the very ears of the Devil. \"We shall live and thrive here, no matter what treacheries you send against us!\"\\n\\n His chest-beating complete, Bidwell stalked to the door but stopped when he realized Matthew had not followed. \"Come along! I want you to read that decree in the streets!\"\\n\\n \"I take my commands from the magistrate, sir. If he requires me to read it for the public, I shall, but not until he so orders it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve neither the time nor inclination to wrangle with you!\" Bidwell\u0027s mouth had taken on an ugly sneer. \"Ohhhh... yes, I see why you wish to dawdle! You intend to console her! If Woodward could see this lovely scene, it would send him two steps nearer his death!\"\\n\\n Matthew\u0027s initial impulse was to advance upon Bidwell and strike his face so hard that what served as the man\u0027s brains might dribble from his ears, but the ensuing duel that would likely follow would provide no good purpose save work for the gravedigger and a probable misspelling of his own name on the marker. Therefore he reined in his inclination and simply glowered daggers at the man.\\n\\n Bidwell laughed, which acted as a bellows to further heat Matthew\u0027s banked fires. \"a tender, touching moment between the witch and her latest conquest! I swear, you\u0027d be better off lying in the lap of Mrs. Nettles! But do as you please!\" He aimed his next jibe at Rachel. \"Demons, old men, or babes in the woods: it doesn\u0027t matter what flavor your suckets! Well, take your rapture, as you shall be paying dearly for it come Monday!\" He turned and made his leave like the strutting bird whose gaudy blue colored his suit.\\n\\n In the aftermath of Bidwell\u0027s departure, Matthew realized that words were not potent enough instruments with which to communicate his sorrow. He rolled up the document, as it would have to be placed on official file in Charles Town.\\n\\n Rachel spoke, her face still shielded. \"You have done what you could. For that I thank you.\" Her voice, though weakened and listless, yet held a full measure of dignity.\\n\\n \"Listen to me!\" Matthew stepped forward and grasped one of the bars with his free hand. \"Monday is still a distance off - \"\\n\\n \"a small distance, \" she interrupted.\\n\\n \"a distance, nevertheless. The magistrate may have issued his decree, but I don\u0027t intend to stop my inquiries.\"\\n\\n \"You might as well.\" She stood up and pushed the cowl back from her face. \"It is finished, whether you accept it or not.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t accept it!\" he shouted. \"I never shall accept it!\" He shut his mouth, shamed by his loss of control; he stared down at the dirty floor, searching within himself for any semblance of an articulate response. \"To accept such a thing... means I agree with it and that is impossible. I can never, as long as I live, agree with this... this wrongful execution of an innocent victim.\"\\n\\n \"Matthewi\" she said softly, and he looked at her. They stared at each other for a moment. Rachel approached him but stopped well short of the bars.\\n\\n She said, \"Go on about your life.\"\\n\\n He found no answer.\\n\\n \"I am dead, \" Rachel told him. \"Dead. When I am taken on Monday to be burned, my body will be there for the flames... but the woman I used to be before Daniel was murdered is no longer here. Since I was brought to this gaol, I have slipped away. I did have hope, at one point, but I hardly remember what it felt like.\"\\n\\n \"You mustn\u0027t give up hope, \" Matthew insisted. \"If there is one more day, there is always - \"\\n\\n \"Stop, \" she said firmly. \"Please... just stop. You think you are doing the right thing, by encouraging my spirit... but you are not. The time has come to embrace reality, and to put aside these... fantasies of my life being spared. Whoever committed these murders is too smart, Matthew. Too... demonic. against such a power, I have no hope and I wish to cease this pretending. It does not prepare me for the stake, and that above all else is what I must do.\"\\n\\n \"I am close to learning something, \" Matthew said. \"Something important, though I\u0027m not sure yet how it relates to you. I think it does, though. I think I have uncovered the first strands that form a rope, and the rope will lead me to - \"\\n\\n \"I am begging you, \" she whispered, and now there were tears in her eyes though her face displayed no other betrayal of emotion, \"to cease this playing with Fate. You can\u0027t free me. Neither can you save my life. Do you not understand that an end has been reachedi\"\\n\\n \"an end has not been reached! I\u0027m telling you, I have found - \"\\n\\n \"You have found something that may mean something, \" Rachel said. \"and you might study it until a year from Monday, but I can\u0027t wish for freedom any longer, Matthew. I am going to be burned, and I must - I must - spend the time I have left in prayer and preparation.\" She looked up at the sunlight that streamed through the hatch, and at the cloudless azure sky beyond. \"When they come for me... I\u0027ll be afraid, but I can\u0027t let them see it. Not Green, not Paine... especially not Bidwell. I can\u0027t allow myself to cry, or to scream and thrash. I don\u0027t want them sitting in Van Gundy\u0027s tavern, boasting over how they broke me. Laughing and drinking and saying how at the end I begged for mercy. I will not. If there is a God in Heaven, He will seal my mouth on that morning. They may cage me and strip me, dirty me and call me witch... but they will not make me into a shrieking animal. Not even on the stake.\" Her eyes met Matthew\u0027s again. \"I have a single wish. Will you grant iti\"\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s possible.\"\\n\\n \"It is. I wish you to walk out of here and not return.\"\\n\\n Matthew hadn\u0027t known what to expect, but this request was as painful - and as startling - as a slap across the face.\\n\\n Rachel watched him intently. When he failed to respond, she said, \"It is more than a wish, it is a demand. I want you to put this place behind you. as I said before: go on about your life.\" Still he couldn\u0027t summon an answer. Rachel came forward two more paces and touched his hand that gripped the bar. \"Thank you for your belief in me, \" she said, her face close to his. \"Thank you for listening. But it\u0027s over now. Please understand that, and accept it.\"\\n\\n Matthew found his voice, though it was near perished. \"How can I go on about my life, knowing such injustice was donei\"\\n\\n She gave him a faint, wry smile. \"Injustice is done somewhere every day. It is a fact of living. If you don\u0027t already know that to be true, you are much less worldly than I thought.\" She sighed, and let her hand fall away from his. \"Go away, Matthew. You\u0027ve done your best.\"\\n\\n \"No, I haven\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You have. If you need me to release you from some imagined obligation to me... there.\" Rachel waved her hand past his face. \"You are released.\"\\n\\n \"I cannot just walk out of here like that, \" he said.\\n\\n \"You have no choice.\" again, she levelled her gaze at him.\\n\\n \"Go on, now. Leave me alone.\" She turned away and went back to her bench.\\n\\n \"I will not give up, \" Matthew said. \"You may... but I swear I won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n over toward her waterbowl. She cupped her hand into it and brought water to her mouth.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t, \" he repeated. \"Do you hear mei\" She pulled her hood over her head, shrouding her face once more, and withdrew into her mansion of solitude.\\n\\n Matthew realized he might stand here as long as he pleased, but Rachel had removed herself to a sanctum that only she could inhabit. He suspected it was the place of reflection - perhaps of the memories of happier times - that had kept her mind from cracking during the long hours of her imprisonment. He realized also, with a twist of anguish, that he was no longer welcome in her company. She did not wish to be distracted from her inner dialogue with Death.\\n\\n It was indeed time to leave her. Still he lingered, watching her immobile figure. He hoped she might say something again to him, but she was silent. after a few moments he went to the door. There was no movement or response from Rachel. He started to speak once more, but he knew not what to say. Goodbye seemed the only proper word, yet he was loath to utter it. He walked out into the cruel sunlight.\\n\\n Shortly the smell of charred wood drifted to his nostrils, and he paused at the pile of blackened ruins. There was hardly anything left to attest that it had ever been a schoolhouse. all four walls were gone, and the roof had fallen in. He wondered if somewhere in the debris might be the wire handle of what had been a bucket.\\n\\n Matthew had almost told Rachel about his findings of last night, but he\u0027d decided not to for the same reason he\u0027d decided to withhold the information from Bidwell: for the moment, the secret was best kept locked in his own vault. He needed an answer to the question of why Winston was spiriting infernal fire from Charles Town and using it to set flame to Bidwell\u0027s dream. He also needed from Winston further details - if the man could supply them - of the so-called surveyor who\u0027d come to Fount Royal. Therefore his mission this morning was clear: to find Edward Winston.\\n\\n He inquired from the first person he saw - a pipe-smoking farmer carrying a flasket of yellow grain - as to the location of Winston\u0027s house, and was informed that the dwelling stood on Harmony Street just shy of the cemetery. Matthew started off to his destination, walking at a brisk pace.\\n\\n The house did stand within a stone\u0027s toss of the first row of grave markers. Matthew noted that the shutters were sealed, indicating that Winston must be out. It was by no means a large dwelling, and probably only held two or three rooms. The house had been painted white at some point in the past but the whitewash had worn off, leaving a mottled appearance to the walls. It occurred to Matthew that - unlike Bidwell\u0027s mansion and some of the sturdier farmhouses - Winston\u0027s abode had an air of shoddy impermanence akin to that found in the slave quarters. Matthew continued up the walk, which was made of packed sand and hammer-crushed oyster shells, and knocked soundly at the door.\\n\\n There was but a short wait. \"Who is iti\" came Winston\u0027s voice - rough-edged and perhaps a bit slurred - from within the house.\\n\\n \"Matthew Corbett. May I please speak with youi\"\\n\\n \"Concerning whati\" This time he was making an obvious effort to disguise what might be termed an unbalanced condition. \"The witchi\"\\n\\n \"No, sir. Concerning a surveyor who came to Fount Royal four years ago.\" Silence fell. \"Mr. Bidwell has told me you walked the man around, \" Matthew pressed on. \"I\u0027d like to know what you might recall of him.\"\\n\\n \"I... have no recollection of such a man. If you\u0027ll forgive me now... I have some ledger business to attend to.\"\\n\\n Matthew doubted that Winston had any business other than drinking and plotting more conflagrations. \"I do have some information pertaining to Rachel Howarth. Might you want to see the magistrate\u0027s decisioni I\u0027ve just come from reading it to her.\"\\n\\n almost at once there was the sound of a latch being undone. The door opened a few inches, enough for a slice of sunlight to enter the house and fall upon Winston\u0027s haggard, unshaven face. \"The decisioni\" he said, squinting in the glare. \"You have it with youi\"\\n\\n \"I do.\" Matthew held up the rolled document. \"May I come ini\"\\n\\n Winston hesitated, but Matthew knew the die had been cast. The door was opened wide enough to admit Matthew and then closed again at his back.\\n\\n Within the small front room, two candles burned on a wicker table. Beside the candles, and set before the bench that Winston had been occupying, was a squat blue bottle and a wooden tankard. Up until this moment Matthew had thought Winston to be - judging from his usual neatness of appearance and his precise manners - a paradigm of efficiency, but Matthew\u0027s opinion suddenly suffered a sharp reversal.\\n\\n The room might have sickened a pig. On the floor lay scattered shirts, stockings, and breeches that Winston had not bothered to pick up. The smell of damp and musty cloth - coupled with body odor from some of the gamier articles - was somewhat less than appealing. also littering the floor were crumpled balls of paper, spilled tobacco, a broken clay pipe here and there, a few books whose bindings had come unstitched, and sundry other items that had outlived their use but not been consigned to a proper garbage pit. Even the narrow little hearth was near choked with cold ashes and bits of trash. In fact, it might be within bounds to say that the entire room resembled a garbage pit, and Matthew shuddered to think what Winston\u0027s bedchamber might conceal. a bucket of sulphurous chemicals might be the least noxious of it.\\n\\n Nearby stood the desk that Winston had recovered from the gaol. Now Matthew understood why it had been so thoroughly cleaned out when Winston had it carted over, as its surface was a jumbled mess of more crumpled and ink-splattered papers, a number of candles melted down to stubs, and a disorderly pile of ledger books. Matthew was surprised that Winston had been able to lay his hands on a clean sheaf of paper and an unspilled inkjar in this rat\u0027s nest. It occurred to him, in his brief but telling inspection, that all Winston\u0027s business with Bidwell was done at the mansion because Winston wished not to reveal his living conditions - and possibly the condition of his mental affairs - to his employer.\\n\\n Winston was pouring liquid from the blue bottle into his tankard. He wore a long gray nightshirt that bore evidence of many poor repatchings, as well as several small scorched holes that told Matthew the man\u0027s control of fire did not extend to power over a spilled pipe. \"So, \" Winston said. \"The decree\u0027s been made, ehi\" He downed some of his pleasure, which Matthew assumed was either hard cider or rum. \"Bring it over here and spread it out.\"\\n\\n Matthew did, but he kept a hand on the document, as it was his charge. Winston leaned over and read the ornate handwriting. \"No surprises there, I see. She\u0027s to be burned on Monday, theni\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"High time. She should\u0027ve gone to the stake a month ago; we\u0027d all be the better for it.\"\\n\\n Matthew rolled the decree up again. He cast a disdainful eye about his surroundings. \"Do you always live in this fashioni\"\\n\\n Winston had been about to drink again, but the tankard\u0027s ascent paused. \"No, \" he said with sarcasm. \"My servants have been called away. Ordinarily I have a footman, a parlor wench, and a chamberpot scrubber.\" The tankard went to his mouth and he wiped his lips with the back of his hand. \"You may go now, Sir Reverence.\"\\n\\n Matthew smiled slightly, but his face was tight. Sir Reverence was gutter slang for human excrement. \"You must have had a late night, \" he said.\\n\\n \"a late nighti\" Winston\u0027s eyebrows went up. \"Meaning whati\"\\n\\n \"Meaning... a late night. I had assumed you were an early riser, and therefore must have been working into the small hours.\"\\n\\n \"Working.\" He nodded. \"Yes. I\u0027m always working.\" He motioned toward the ledger-laden desk. \"See therei Managing his money. His pence and guineas and dog dollars. His ins and outs. That\u0027s what I do.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t sound particularly proud of your accomplishments for Mr. Bidwell, \" Matthew ventured. \"He must rely on your services quite a lot, doesn\u0027t hei\"\\n\\n Winston stared at Matthew, his bloodshot eyes wary. \"You may go now, \" he repeated, with a more ominous inflection.\\n\\n \"I shall. But Mr. Bidwell himself suggested I find you and ask about the surveyor. as you were the one who escorted the man around, I hoped that - \"\\n\\n \"a surveyori I hardly remember the man!\" again Winston quaffed from the tankard, and this time the gleaming residue trickled down his chin. \"What was iti Four years agoi\"\\n\\n \"Or thereabouts.\"\\n\\n \"Go on, get out!\" Winston sneered. \"I don\u0027t have time for your foolishness!\"\\n\\n Matthew took a deep breath. \"Yes, you do, \" he answered.\\n\\n \"Whati By God, will I have to throw you out of herei\"\\n\\n Matthew said quietly, \"I know about your nocturnal activities.\"\\n\\n The hand of God might have come down to stop time and still all sounds.\\n\\n Matthew went on, taking advantage of the moment. \"In addition, I have one of the six buckets that Mr. Rawlings and the others buried. Therefore it\u0027s no use to go out tonight and move them. The seventh bucket you took away is hidden here somewhere, I presumei\"\\n\\n The hand of God was a mighty instrument. It had turned Edward Winston into a gape-mouthed statue. In another few seconds, however, the tankard slipped from Winston\u0027s grasp and crashed to the floor.\\n\\n \"I presume it is, \" Matthew said. \"You used a brush to paint the chemicals on the walls of the houses you set afire, am I correcti It does seem to be a potent concoction.\"\\n\\n Winston did not move, did not speak, and hardly appeared to be breathing. The color of his face and the somber grisard of his nightshirt were one and the same.\\n\\n Matthew spent a moment looking around the littered room before he spoke again. \"This is what I believe, \" he said. \"That on one of your supply trips to Charles Town with Nicholas Paine, you approached someone of authority there. Possibly Mr. Danforth, the harbormaster, but possibly someone with more interest in seeing that Fount Royal never grows to Bidwell\u0027s ambition. I suspect you might have sent Mr. Paine on some errand or another while you made this contact. He doesn\u0027t know, does hei\"\\n\\n Matthew hadn\u0027t expected Winston to reply, therefore he was not disappointed. \"I don\u0027t think he knows, \" Matthew said. \"I think this is your intrigue alone. You volunteered to take advantage of Rachel Howarth\u0027s plight and set numerous fires to empty houses, thus speeding along the process of emptying more. am I so far correcti\" Winston slowly sank down upon his bench, his mouth still open.\\n\\n \"The problem was that you needed an incendiary to ignite in wet weather.\" Matthew prodded some discarded clothes with the toe of his right shoe. \"The buckets of chemicals had to be mixed in Charles Town and secreted here by ship. The crew must have had some rough voyages, I\u0027d suspect. But Mr. Rawlings must be making a profit for his risk. I would think you are making a profit for your risk as well. Or perhaps you\u0027ve been promised a position in Charles Town after Fount Royal failsi\"\\n\\n Winston lifted a hand and put it to his forehead, his eyes glassy with shock.\\n\\n \"It is to your credit that you don\u0027t mar your dignity with denials, \" Matthew offered. \"I am curious, though. Bidwell tells me you\u0027ve been in his employ for eight years. Why did you turn against himi\"\\n\\n Now both hands were pressed to Winston\u0027s face. He breathed raggedly, his shoulders slumped.\\n\\n \"I have seen enough of human nature to have an idea.\" Matthew went to the cluttered desk and opened one of the ledger books. He flipped through the pages as he spoke. \"You know more than anyone else how much Bidwell is worth. You see his wealth on display, you see his plans for the future, and you see... your own existence, which according to the way you live is at a low flux. So I would venture to say this revolves around your own perceived misery. Did they promise you a mansion in Charles Towni a statue in your honori What exactly did they promise, Mr. Winstoni\"\\n\\n Winston reached with a feeble hand for the blue bottle, brought it to his mouth, and took a long swallow of courage. When he lowered the bottle, he blinked away tears and said, \"Money.\"\\n\\n \"Considerably more than Bidwell was paying you, yesi\"\\n\\n \"More than... I could hope to earn in two lifetimes.\" again he drank copiously from the bottle. \"You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like, working for him. Being around him... and all that he has. He spends on wigs alone every year an amount I might live on as a prince. and the clothes and food! If you knew the numbers, you would understand and be sickened as I am by the man\u0027s philosophy: not a shilling more for a servant\u0027s needs, but spare no expense for the master\u0027s desires!\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t defend him, but I will say that such is the right of a master.\"\\n\\n \"It is the right of no man!\" Winston said heatedly. \"I have an education, I am literate, and I consider myself reasonably bright! But I might as well be a slave, as far as he\u0027s concerned! I might even be the better for it!\" He laughed harshly. \"at least Bidwell cares enough about Goode to have bought him a fiddle!\"\\n\\n \"The difference is that Goode is a slave and you\u0027re a free man. You can choose your employer. Then again...\" Matthew nodded. \"I suppose you have.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, be as smug as you please!\" Winston turned upon Matthew an expression of the deepest disgust. \"Look at my house, and look at his! Then look in the ledgers and see who directs the course of his monies! I do! He pretends to be such a sterling businessman, but in fact he is skilled at two things: intimidation and bluster. I ought to be a partner in his enterprises, for what I\u0027ve encouraged! But it has been clearly and plainly shown to me by his actions that Bidwell takes good opinions and presents them as his own.\"\\n\\n He held up a finger to mark his point. \"Now, failed ventures... that\u0027s a different cart. Failure is always the fault of someone else... someone who invariably deserves to be banished from the kingdom. I have seen it happen. When Fount Royal fails - and it will, regardless of how many houses I flamed and how long the witch roasts on her stake - he will begin to fire his cannons of blame at every possible target. Including this one.\" He thumped his chest with his fist. \"Do you think I should sit at his beck and call and await a further slide into povertyi No. For your information - -and whatever you choose to do with it - I did not do the approaching. They approached me, when Paine and I were on separate tasks in Charles Town. at first I refused... but they sweetened their offer with a house and a position on the Shipping Council. It was my idea to set the fires.\"\\n\\n \"and a clever idea it was, \" Matthew said. \"You hid behind Rachel Howarth\u0027s skirts and the Devil\u0027s shadow. Did it not trouble you in the least that these fires were ascribed to heri\"\\n\\n \"No, \" he answered without hesitation. \"If you\u0027ll read that document you hold, you\u0027ll find there\u0027s no charge there concerning the setting of fires. She fashioned the poppets, committed the murders, and consorted with Satan of her own accord. I simply used the situation to my benefit.\"\\n\\n \"Simplyi\" Matthew echoed. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything simpleminded about you, Mr. Winston. I think coldly might be a better word.\"\\n\\n \"as you please.\" Winston offered a bitter smile. \"I have learned from Bidwell that one fights fire with fire and ice with ice.\" His eyes narrowed. \"So. You have a bucket. I presume you were hiding out therei\" He waited for Matthew to nod. \"Who else knowsi\"\\n\\n \"If you are considering violence as a solution, you might think otherwise. Someone else does know, but your secret is in no current danger.\"\\n\\n Winston frowned. \"What, theni aren\u0027t you going to go running to Bidwell and tell himi\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not. as you\u0027ve pointed out, the fires were incidental in the charges against Madam Howarth. I am hunting a smarter - and colder - fox than you.\"\\n\\n \"Pardon my dulled wits, but what are you talking abouti\"\\n\\n \"Your grievance against Bidwell is not my concern. Whatever you choose to do from this point is not of interest to me, either. as long as there are no future conflagrations, I might add.\"\\n\\n Winston let go a sigh of relief. \"Sir, \" he said, \"I bow gratefully before your mercy.\"\\n\\n \"My mercy has a price. I wish to know about the surveyor.\"\\n\\n \"The surveyor, \" Winston repeated. He rubbed his temples with both hands. \"I tell you... I can hardly recall the man. Why do you care to know about him, anywayi\"\\n\\n \"My interest is a personal matter. Do you remember his namei\"\\n\\n \"No. Wait... give me a moment...\" He closed his eyes, obviously trying his best to concentrate. \"I think... it was Spencer ... Spicer... something similar to that, at least.\" His eyes opened.\\n\\n \"The man was beardedi\"\\n\\n \"Yes... a heavy beard. and he wore a hat.\"\\n\\n \"a tricorni\"\\n\\n \"No. It was... a loose-brimmed shade hat. Much like any farmer or traveller might wear. I remember... his clothing was rustic, as well.\"\\n\\n \"You took him walking around Fount Royal. How much time would you say you spent with himi\"\\n\\n Winston shrugged. \"The better part of an afternoon, I suppose.\"\\n\\n \"Do you recall his descriptioni\"\\n\\n \"a beard and a hat, \" Winston said. \"That\u0027s all I can remember.\"\\n\\n \"and probably all you were meant to remember.\" Winston gave him a questioning look. \"What does this concerni\"\\n\\n \"It concerns the manipulation of memory, \" Matthew answered. \"Something I think my fox knows a great deal about.\"\\n\\n \"If you are making sense, I am unable to follow it.\"\\n\\n \"I believe I have information enough.
