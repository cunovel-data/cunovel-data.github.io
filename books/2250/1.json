{"id":85881,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"CaME THE TIME when the two travellers knew night would catch them, and shelter must be found. It had been a joyful day for frogs and mudhens. For the human breed, however, the low gray clouds and chill rain coiled chains around the soul. By the calendar the month of May should by all rights and predictions be charitable if not merry, but this May had entered like a grim-lipped miser pinching out candles in church.\n Waterfalls streamed through the thick branches that interlocked forty feet above the road. The leaves of ancient oaks and elms, and the needles of the lofty pines, were more ebon than green, the huge trunks bearded with moss and blotched by brown lumps of fungus the size of a blacksmith\u0027s fist. To say that there was a road beneath those branches would be taking liberties with language: it was a canchre-colored mudhole emerging from the mist and disappearing into the mist.\n \"Steady, steady,\" said the wagon\u0027s driver to the pair of laboring nags as they pulled southward, breath steaming and skinny flanks trembling against the weight of wooden wheels through slop. He had a small stinger of a whip close at hand, but he declined to use it. The horses, which along with the wagon had been afforded him from the municipal stable of Charles Town, were doing all they could. Beneath the wagon\u0027s soaked brown burlap canopy, and behind the raw pinewood plank that occasionally fired splinters into the travellers\u0027 rear ends, were two unmatched trunks, a valise, and a wig box, all four pieces of luggage bearing scars and gouges that betrayed lives of undignified shipment.\n Thunder rumbled overhead. The horses struggled to lift their hooves in the muck. \"Get up, there,\" the driver said, with not a smudge of enthusiasm. He gave the reins a half-hearted flick, his hands protected by a pair of gray cloth gloves, then he sat without further comment as raindrops fell from the furled edges of his black, mud-spattered tricorn hat and added more soggy bulk to his raven\u0027s-hue fearnaught coat.\"Shall I take them, siri\"\n The driver glanced at his fellow sufferer, who was offering to hold the reins. By no idylls of the imagination could the two be called bookends; the driver was fifty-five years of age, the passenger fresh of twenty. The older man was big-boned and had a heavy-jowled and ruddy face, with thick and bristling gray eyebrows set like ramparts over deeply cast ice-blue eyes that were as congenial as newly primed cannon barrels. His nose - as a polite Englishman might say - was well-dimensioned. a forthright Dutchman might say its owner had bloodhound in his lineage. The driver\u0027s chin was also a sturdy piece of sculpture, a square bulwark scored with a cleft that could have sheltered a small musket ball. Usually his face was scraped clean by scrupulous passes of the razor, but today the salt-and-pepper beard was making an appearance.\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"Thank you.\" He passed the reins over, one of the many times they\u0027d exchanged this duty in the past hours, and worked some feeling back into his fingers.\n The younger man\u0027s lean, long-jawed face had courted more candle glow than sunlight. He was thin but not frail, rather sinewy like a tough garden vine. He wore square-toed shoes, white stockings, olive-green breeches, and a short, tight-fitting brown jacket made of cheap kerseymere over a plain white linen shirt. The knees of his breeches and the elbows of his jacket had been patched at least as often as the older man\u0027s clothing. On his head was a dun-colored woolen cap, pulled down over finely textured black hair that had recently been cropped close to the scalp to combat an infestation of lice in Charles Town. Everything about the younger man - nose, chin, cheekbones, elbows, knees - conveyed the impression of sharp angles. His eyes were gray, flecked with dark blue, the colors of smoke at twilight. He did not urge on the horses nor spank them with the reins; he only intended to guide. He was if anything a stoic. He understood the value of stoicism, for already in his life he\u0027d endured such trials as might break someone who did not.\n as he worked his hands, the older man mused that if he saw fifty-six after this ordeal then he should put aside his vocation and become a Samaritan in thanks to God. He was not cut from the crude frontier cloth. He considered himself a man of taste and refinement, an urban denizen ill-suited to pierce this wilderness. He appreciated clean brickwork and painted fences, the pleasing symmetry of manicured hedges, and the solid regularity of the lamplighter\u0027s rounds. He was a civilized man. Rain was down his neck and in his boots, the light was fading, and he had but a single rusty saber in the wagon with which to protect their belongings and their scalps. The village of Fount Royal lay at the end of this mudtrack, but that was cold comfort. His task at that place would not be a gentle one.\n But now a touch of mercy! The rain was tapering off, the sound of thunder more distant than before. The older man thought that the worst of the storm must be moving over the ocean, which they\u0027d glimpsed as a frothy gray plain through brief breaks in the forest. Still, a nasty drizzle continued to sting their faces. The hanging folds of mist had curtained the treelimbs, giving the forest a phantasmagoric pall. The wind had stilled, the air thick with a swampy green smell.\n \"Carolina spring,\" the older man muttered, his husky voice carrying the melodic accent of well-bred English generations. \"There\u0027ll be many new flowers in the graveyard come summer.\"\n The younger man didn\u0027t answer, but inwardly he was thinking that they might perish on this road, that a stroke of evil could befall them and they\u0027d vanish from the face of the earth just as Magistrate Kingsbury had vanished on this same journey not two weeks ago. The fact that wild Indians haunted these woods, along with all manner of savage animals, was not lost on his imagination. Even with its lice and plague deaths, Charles Town looked like paradise compared to this dripping green hell. The settlers of Fount Royal must be insane to stake their lives and fortunes on such a territory, he\u0027d decided.\n But what now was Charles Town had itself been wilderness twenty years ago. Now it was a city and a thriving port, so who could say what Fount Royal might becomei Still, he knew that for every Charles Town there were dozens of other settlements that had been devoured by misfortunes. Such too might be the eventual fate of Fount Royal, but at present it was the physical reality of someone\u0027s hard-worked dream, and the problem there must be tended to like any problem of a civilized society. But the question remained: why had Magistrate Kingsbury, en route from Charles Town to Fount Royal on this same - and only - road, never reached his destinationi The older man had supplied a number of answers to the younger\u0027s inquiry - that Kingsbury had run afoul of Indians or highwaymen, that his wagon had broken down and he\u0027d been set upon by beasts. But though the older man had the nose resembling a bloodhound\u0027s, it was the younger man who had the bloodhound\u0027s instinct. any lingering scent of a question was strong enough to keep him pondering in pale candle glow long after the older man had retired and was snoring in his bedchamber.\"What\u0027s thati\"\n a gray-gloved finger pointed toward the mist ahead. In a moment the younger man saw what his companion had spied: the pitch of a roof off to the right side of the road. It was the same dark green and wet black as the woods, and might be as ruined a place as the trading post at which they\u0027d expected to rest the horses and break bread in early afternoon, but instead had found only charred timbers and collapse. But there on the roof before them was a pretty sight: a stone chimney flying a flag of white smoke. The mist moved, and the rough-hewn lines of a log cabin took shape.\n \"Shelter!\" said the older man, with exultant relief. \"God\u0027s grace on us, Matthew!\"\n It was a fairly new structure, which explained why it hadn\u0027t been marked on the map. The nearer they got, the stronger was the smell of freshly axed pinelogs. Matthew noted, perhaps ungraciously, that the cabin\u0027s builder had not been the most skilled nor neatest of craftsmen. Copious amounts of red mud had been used to seal the cracks and chinks in crooked walls. The chimney was more mud than stones, spitting smoke through its fissures. The roof sat at a precarious angle, like a tilted cap on the head of a blowzy drunk. The cabin was unadorned by any paint or decoration, and the small narrow windows were all sealed by plain plankboard shutters. Behind the cabin was an even more slovenly looking structure that must be a barn, beside which stood three swaybacked horses in a fenced enclosure. a half-dozen pigs snorted and grumbled in the nasty mire of a second pen nearby. a red rooster strutted about, followed by a number of wet hens and their muddy chicks.\n a stake had been driven into the ground beside a hitching rail. Nailed to the stake was a green pinewood placard with the words Tavern Ye Trade scrawled on it in thick egg-white paint.\n \"a tavern too!\" the older man said, taking the reins from Matthew as if his hands could speed them to that hitching rail any faster. \"We\u0027ll get a hot meal tonight after all!\"\n One of the horses back by the barn began nickering, and suddenly a shutter opened and an indistinct face peered out. \"Hello!\" the older man called. \"We\u0027re in need of shel - \"The shutter slammed closed.\n \" - ter,\" he finished. Then, as the horses made their last slog to the rail, \"Whoa! Hold up!\" He watched the shutter. \"Inhospitable for a tavern-keeper. Well, here we are and here we\u0027ll stay. Right, Matthewi\"\"Yes, sir.\" It was said with less than firm conviction.\n The older man climbed down from his seat. His boots sank into the mud up to his ankles. He tied the reins to the hitching post as Matthew eased himself down. Even losing two inches to the mud, Matthew was taller than his companion; he stood ten inches over five feet, an exceptionally tall young man, whereas his companion was a more normal height at five feet seven inches.\n a bolt was thrown. The cabin\u0027s door opened with dramatic flourish. \"Good day, good day!\" said the man who stood on the threshold. He wore a stained buckskin jacket over a brown shirt, gray-striped breeches and gaudy yellow stockings that showed above calf-high boots. He was smiling broadly, displaying peglike teeth in a face as round as a chestnut. \"Come in and warm y\u0027selves!\"\n \"I\u0027m not certain about it being a good day, but we will surely enjoy a fire.\"\n Matthew and the older man scaled two steps to the porch. The tavern-keeper stepped back and held open the door for their entry. Before they reached him, both wished the pungence of the pinewood was stronger, so as to mask the appalling smell of their host\u0027s unwashed body and dirty clothes. \"Girl!\" he hollered to someone inside the tavern, just as Matthew\u0027s left ear got in the path of his pewter-melting voice. \"Put another log on that fire and move y\u0027self quick!\"\n The door closed at their backs and gone was the light. It was so gloomy in the place that neither of the two travellers could see anything but the red glimmer of fitful flames. Not all the smoke was leaving through the chimney; a duke\u0027s portion of it had made its home in the room, and hung in greasy gray layers. Matthew had the sensation of other shapes moving around them, but his eyes were blurred by smoke. He felt a knotty hand press against his back. \"Go on, go on!\" the tavern-keeper urged. \"Get the chill out!\"\n They shuffled closer to the hearth. Matthew banged into a table\u0027s edge. Someone - a muffled voice - spoke, someone else laughed and the laugh became a hacking cough. \"Damn ye, mind your manners!\" the tavern-keeper snapped. \"We got gentlemen among us!\"\n The older man had to cough several times too, to relieve his lungs of the tart smoke. He stood at the flickering edge of the firelight and peeled off his wet gloves, his eyes stinging. \"We\u0027ve been travelling all day,\" he said. \"From Charles Town. We thought we\u0027d see red faces ere we saw white.\"\n \"Yessir, the red demons are thick \u0027round here. But you never see \u0027em \u0027less they wants to be saw. I\u0027m Will Shawcombe. This is my tavern and tradin\u0027 post.\"\n The older man was aware that a hand had been offered to him through the haze. He took it, and felt a palm as hard as a Quaker\u0027s saddle. \"My name is Isaac Woodward,\" he replied. \"This is Matthew Corbett.\" He nodded toward his companion, who was busy rubbing warmth into his fingers.\n \"From Charles Town, do y\u0027sayi\" Shawcombe\u0027s grip was still clamped to the other man\u0027s hand. \"and how are things therei\"\n \"Livable.\" Woodward pulled his hand away and couldn\u0027t help but wonder how many times he would have to scrub it before all the reek was gone. \"But the air\u0027s been troublesome there these past few weeks. We\u0027ve had hot and cold humours that test the spirit.\"\n \"Rain won\u0027t quit \u0027round these parts,\" Shawcombe said. \"Steam one mornin\u0027, shiver the next.\"\n \"End a\u0027 the world, most like,\" someone else - that muffled voice - spoke up. \"ain\u0027t right to wear blankets this time a\u0027 year. Devil\u0027s beatin\u0027 his wife, what he is.\"\n \"Hush up!\" Shawcombe\u0027s small dark eyes cut toward the speaker. \"You don\u0027t know nothin\u0027!\"\n \"I read the Bible, I know the Lord\u0027s word! End a\u0027 time and all unclean things, what it is!\"\n \"I\u0027ll strop you, you keep that up!\" Shawcombe\u0027s face, by the flickering red firelight, had become a visage of barely bridled rage. Woodward had noted that the tavern-keeper was a squat, burly man maybe five-foot-six, with wide powerful shoulders and a chest like an ale keg. Shawcombe had an unruly thatch of brown hair streaked with gray and a short, grizzled gray beard, and he looked like a man not to be trifled with. His accent - a coarse lowborn English yawp - told Woodward the man was not far removed from the docks on the river Thames.\n Woodward glanced in the direction of the Bible-reader, as did Matthew, and made out through the drifting smoke a gnarled and white-bearded figure sitting at one of several crudely fashioned tables set about the room. The old man\u0027s eyes caught red light, glittering like new-blown coals. \"If you been at that rum again, I\u0027ll hide you!\" Shawcombe promised. The old man started to open his mouth for a reply but had enough elder wisdom not to let the words escape. When Woodward looked at the tavern-keeper again, Shawcombe was smiling sheepishly and the brief display of anger had passed. \"My uncle abner,\" Shawcombe said, in a conspiratorial whisper. \"His brain pot\u0027s sprung a leak.\"\n a new figure emerged through the murk into the firelight, brushing between Woodward and Matthew to the edge of a large hearth rimmed with black-scorched stones. This person - slim, slight, barely over five feet tall - wore a patched moss-green woolen shift and had long dark brown hair. a chunk of pinewood and an armload of cones and needles were tossed into the flames. Matthew found himself looking at the pallid, long-chinned profile of a young girl, her unkempt hair hanging in her face. She paid him no attention, but moved quickly away again. The gloom swallowed her up.\n \"Maude! What\u0027re you sittin\u0027 there fori Get these gentlemen draughts of rum!\" This command had been hurled at another woman in the room, sitting near the old man. a chair scraped back across the raw plank floor, a cough came up followed by another that ended in a hacking gasp, and then Maude - a skinny white-haired wraith in clothes that resembled burlap bags stitched together - dragged herself muttering and clucking out of the room and through a doorway beyond the hearth. \"Christ save our arses!\" Shawcombe hollered in her miserable wake. \"You\u0027d think we never seen a breathin\u0027 human before in need of food or drink! This here\u0027s a tavern, or ain\u0027t you heardi\" His mood rapidly changed once more as he regarded Woodward with a hopeful expression. \"You\u0027ll be stayin\u0027 the night with us, won\u0027t you, sirrahi There\u0027s a room right comfortable back there, won\u0027t cost you but a few pence. Got a bed with a good soft mattress, ease your back from that long trip.\"\n \"May I ask a questioni\" Matthew decided to say before his companion could respond. \"How far is Fount Royali\"\n \"Fount Royali Oh, young master, that\u0027s a two, three hour ride on a good road. The weather bein\u0027 such, I\u0027d venture it\u0027d take you double that. and dark\u0027s comin\u0027 on. I wouldn\u0027t care to meet Jack One Eye or a red savage without a torch and a musket.\" Shawcombe focused his attention once more on the older traveller. \"So you\u0027ll be stayin\u0027 the night theni\"\n \"Yes, of course,\" Woodward began to unbutton his heavy coat. \"We\u0027d be fools to continue on in the dark.\"\n \"I suspect you have luggage in need of cartin\u0027i\" His smile slipped off as his head turned. \"abner\\ Get your arse up and fetch their belongin\u0027s! Girl, you go too!\"\n The girl had been standing motionlessly with her back against a wall, her face downcast and her bare arms crossed over her chest. She made no sound, but walked at Shawcombe\u0027s drumbeat toward the door, her feet and legs clad in knee-high deerskin boots. \"ain\u0027t fit for a pig out there!\" abner complained, holding firm to his chair.\n \"No, but it\u0027s just right for a hog like you!\" Shawcombe countered, and daggers shot from his eyes again. \"Now get up and get to it!\" Muttering under his beard, abner pulled himself to his feet and limped after the girl as if his very legs were stricken by some crippling disease.\n Matthew had wanted to ask Shawcombe who \"Jack One Eye\" was, but he hated the thought of that girl and the old man - the girl, especially - struggling with the heavy trunks. \"I should help.\" He started toward the door, but Shawcombe gripped his arm.\n \"No need. Those two sops sit \u0027round here too long, they get lazy. Let \u0027em stir a bone for their supper.\"\n Matthew paused, staring into the other man\u0027s eyes. He saw something in them - ignorance, pettiness, pure cruelty perhaps - that sickened him. He had seen this man before - with different faces, of course - and he knew him to be a bully who revelled in power over the weak of body and feeble of mind. He saw also a glint of what might have been recognition of his perceptions, which meant Shawcombe might be more intelligent than Matthew had surmised. Shawcombe was smiling slightly, a twist of the mouth. Slowly but forcefully, Matthew began to pull his arm away from Shawcombe\u0027s hand. The tavern-keeper, still smiling, would not release him. \"I said,\" Matthew repeated, \"that I should help them.\"\n Shawcombe didn\u0027t surrender his grip. Now at last Woodward, who had been shrugging out of his coat, realized some small drama was being played out before him. \"Yes,\" he said, \"they will need help with the trunks, I think.\"\n \"Yessir, as you say.\" Shawcombe\u0027s hand instantly left the young man\u0027s arm. \"I\u0027d go m\u0027self, but my back ain\u0027t no good. Used to lift them heavy bales, port a\u0027 Thames, but I can\u0027t do it no - \"\n Matthew gave a grunt and turned away, walking out the door into the last blue light and what was now blessedly fresh air. The old man had hold of Woodward\u0027s wig box, while the girl was around behind the wagon trying to hoist one of the trunks up on her back. \"Here,\" Matthew said, slogging through the mud to her. \"Let me help you.\" He took hold of one of the leather handles, and when he did the girl skittered away from him as if he were a leper. Her end of the trunk smacked down into the muck. She stood there in the rain, her shoulders hunched over and the lank hair covering her face.\n \"Ha!\" abner chortled. In this clearer light, his skin was as dull gray as wet parchment. \"ain\u0027t no use you talkin\u0027 to her, she don\u0027t say nothin\u0027 to nobody. She\u0027s one step out of Bedlam, what she is.\"\"What\u0027s her namei\"\n abner was silent, his scabby brow furrowing. \"Girl,\" he answered. He laughed again as if this were the most foolish thing any man had ever been asked, and then he carried the wig box inside.\n Matthew watched the girl for a moment. She was beginning to shiver from the chill, but yet she made no sound nor lifted her gaze from the mud that lay between them. He was going to have to heft the trunk - and the second one as well, most likely - in by himself, unless he could get abner to help. He looked up through the treetops. The rain, strengthening now, pelted his face. There was no use in standing here, shoes buried in the mire, and bewailing his position in this world; it had been worse, and could yet be. as for the girl, who knew her storyi Who even gave a spiti No one; why then should hei He started dragging the trunk through the mud, but he stopped before he reached the porch.\n \"Go inside,\" he told the girl. \"I\u0027ll bring the other things.\"\n She didn\u0027t move. He suspected she\u0027d remain exactly where she was, until Shawcombe\u0027s voice whipped her.\n It was not his concern. Matthew pulled the trunk up to the porch, but before he hauled it across the threshold he looked again at the girl and saw she had tilted her head back, her arms outflung, her eyes closed and her mouth open to catch the rain. He thought that perhaps - even in her madness - it was her way of cleansing Shawcombe\u0027s smell off her skin. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-1.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \n Judgment of the Witch \n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
