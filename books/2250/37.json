{"id":85917,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"aRE YOU WELLi Truthfully, now.\" Matthew had been staring out the open window in the magistrate\u0027s room, out over the sun-washed roofs and the fount\u0027s sparkling blue water. It was mid-afternoon, and he was watching yet another wagon pass through the distant gate. This morning he\u0027d been aware of an almost-continual departure of wagons and oxcarts, their rumbling wheels and thudding animal hooves kicking up a haze of yellow dust that blotted the air around the gate like a perpetual stain. a sad sight had been that of Robert Bidwell, his wig dusty and his shirttail hanging out, as he stood on Harmony Street pleading with his citizens to remain in their homes. at last Winston and Johnstone had led him away to Van Gundy\u0027s tavern, even though it was the Sabbath. Van Gundy himself had loaded his belongings - included that wretched gittern - and quit Fount Royal. Matthew assumed that a few bottles still stocked the tavern, and in them Bidwell was seeking to lessen the agony of his perceived failure.\\n\\n Matthew would have been surprised if any less than sixty persons had departed Fount Royal since dawn. Of course the threat of meeting nightfall between here and Charles Town had choked off the flow as the day progressed, but obviously there were those who preferred to risk the night journey rather than spend another eve in a witch-haunted town. Matthew predicted a similar flight at tomorrow\u0027s sunrise, notwithstanding the fact that it was Rachel\u0027s execution morn, since by the declaration so cleverly written in Lancaster\u0027s house, every neighbor might be a servant of Satan.\\n\\n Today the church had been empty, but Exodus Jerusalem\u0027s camp had been full of terrified citizens. Matthew mused that Jerusalem must have thought he\u0027d truly found himself a gold-pot. The preacher\u0027s braying voice had risen and fallen like the waves of a storm-whipped sea, and also rising and falling in accord had been the frenzied cries and shrieks of his fear-drowned audience.\\n\\n \"Matthewi are you welli\" Woodward asked again, from his bed.\\n\\n \"I was just thinking, \" Matthew said. \"That... even though the sun shines brightly, and the sky is clear and blue... it is a very ugly day.\" So saying, he closed the shutters, which he had only opened a minute or two before. Then he returned to his chair at the magistrate\u0027s bedside and sat down.\\n\\n \"Has something...\" Woodward paused, as his voice was still frail. His throat was again in considerable pain and his bones ached, but he wished not to mention such worrisome things to Matthew on the eve of the witch\u0027s death. \"Has something happenedi My ears seem stopped up, but... I think I have heard wagon wheels... and much commotion.\"\\n\\n \"a few citizens have decided to leave town, \" Matthew explained, deliberately keeping his tone casual. \"I suspect it has something to do with the burning. There was an unfortunate scene in the street, when Mr. Bidwell stationed himself to try to dissuade their departure.\"\\n\\n \"Was he successfuli\"\\n\\n \"No, sir.\"\\n\\n \"ah. That poor soul. I feel for him, Matthew.\" Woodward leaned his head back on his pillow. \"He has done his best... and the Devil has done his worst.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir, I agree.\"\\n\\n Woodward turned his face so he had a good view of his clerk. \"I know we have not been in agreement... on very much of late. I regret that any harsh words were spoken.\"\\n\\n \"as do I.\"\\n\\n \"I know also... how you must be feeling. The despondence and despair. Because you still believe her to be innocent. am I correcti\"\\n\\n \"You are, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Is there nothing... I can say or do to change your mindi\"\\n\\n Matthew offered him a slight smile. \"Is there nothing I can say or do to change yoursi\"\\n\\n \"No, \" Woodward said firmly. \"and I suspect that... we might never come to common ground on this.\" He sighed, his expression pained. \"You will disagree, of course... but I appeal to you... to lay aside your obvious emotion and consider the facts as I did. I made my decree... based on those facts, and those facts alone. Not based on the accused\u0027s physical beauty... or her prowess at twisting words... or her misused intelligence. The facts, Matthew. I had no choice... but to pronounce her guilty, and to sentence her to such a death. Can you not understandi\"\\n\\n Matthew didn\u0027t reply, but instead stared at his folded hands.\\n\\n \"No one ever told me, \" Woodward said softly, \"that... being a judge would be easy. In fact... I was promised... by my own mentor that it would be an iron cloak... once put on, impossible to remove. I have found it doubly true. But... I have tried to be fair, and I have tried to be correct. What more can I doi\"\\n\\n \"Nothing more, \" Matthew said.\\n\\n \"ah. Then perhaps... we might return to common ground after all. You will understand these things so much better... after you wear the iron cloak yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe I ever shall, \" came Matthew\u0027s answer, before he could guard his speech.\\n\\n \"You say that now... but it is your youth and despair speaking. Your affronted sense of... what is right and wrong. You are looking at the dark side of the moon, Matthew. The execution of a prisoner... is never a happy occasion, no matter the crime.\" He closed his eyes, his strength draining away. \"But what joy... what relief... when you are able to discover the truth... and set an innocent person free. That alone... justifies the iron cloak. You will see... all in God\u0027s time.\"\\n\\n a tap at the door announced a visitor. Matthew said, \"Who is iti\"\\n\\n The door opened. Dr. Shields stood on the threshold, holding his medical bag. Matthew had noted that since the murder of Nicholas Paine, the doctor\u0027s countenance had remained gaunt and hollow-eyed, much as Matthew had found him at the infirmary. In truth, the doctor appeared to Matthew to be laboring under an iron cloak of his own, as Shields\u0027s moist face was milk-pale, his eyes watery and red-rimmed beneath the magnifying lenses of his spectacles. \"Pardon my intrusion, \" he said. \"I\u0027ve brought the magistrate\u0027s afternoon dose.\"\\n\\n \"Come in, doctor, come in!\" Woodward pulled himself up to a sitting position, eager for a taste of that healing tonic.\\n\\n Matthew got up from his chair and moved away so Dr. Shields might administer the dose. The doctor had already this morning been cautioned again - as yesterday - not to mention the events transpiring in Fount Royal, which he had the good sense not to do even if he hadn\u0027t been cautioned. He agreed with Matthew that, though the magistrate appealed to be gaining strength, it was yet wise not to pressure his health with the disastrous news.\\n\\n When the dose had been swallowed and Woodward settled again to await the oncoming of precious sleep, Matthew followed Dr. Shields out into the hallway and closed the magistrate\u0027s door.\\n\\n \"Tell me, \" Matthew said in a guarded tone. \"Your best and honest opinion: When will the magistrate be able to traveli\"\\n\\n \"He does improve daily.\" Shields\u0027s spectacles had slipped down his beak, and he pushed them up again. \"I am very pleased with his response to the tonic. If all goes well... I would say two weeks.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean, \u0027if all goes well\u0027i He\u0027s out of danger, isn\u0027t hei\"\\n\\n \"His condition was very serious. Life-threatening, as you well know. To say he\u0027s out of danger is an oversimplification.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you were so pleased with his response to the tonic.\"\\n\\n \"I am, \" Shields said forcefully. \"But I must tell you something about that tonic. I created it myself from what I had at hand. I purposefully strengthened it as much as I dared, to encourage the body to increase its blood flow and thereby - \"\\n\\n \"Yes, yes, \" Matthew interrupted. \"I know all that about the stagnant blood. What of the tonici\"\\n\\n \"It is... how shall I say this... an extreme experiment. I\u0027ve never before administered that exact mixture, in so powerful a dosage.\"\\n\\n Matthew had an inkling now of what the doctor was getting at. He said, \"Go on.\"\\n\\n \"The tonic was mixed strong enough to make him feel better. To lessen his pain. To... reawaken his natural healing processes.\"\\n\\n \"In other words, \" Matthew said, \"it\u0027s a powerful narcotic that gives him the illusion of well-beingi\"\\n\\n \"The word powerful is... uh... an understatement, I fear. The correct term might be Herculean.\"\\n\\n \"Then without this tonic he would regress to the state he was in beforei\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say. I do know for certain that his fever is much reduced and his breathing greatly freed. The condition of his throat has also improved. So: I have done what you required of me, young man. I have brought the magistrate back from death\u0027s door... at the penalty of his being dependent on the tonic.\"\\n\\n \"Which means, \" Matthew said grimly, \"that the magistrate is also dependent on the tonic\u0027s maker. Just in case I might wish to pursue you in the future for the murder of Nicholas Paine.\"\\n\\n Shields flinched at this, and pressed a finger to his mouth to request that Matthew regulate his volume. \"No, you\u0027re wrong, \" he said. \"I swear it. That had nothing to do with my mixing the tonic. as I said, I used what was at hand, in a strength I judged sufficient for the task. and as for Paine... if you\u0027d please not mention him again to mei In fact, I demand you do not.\"\\n\\n Matthew had seen what might have been a blade-twist of agony in the doctor\u0027s eyes, a fleeting thing that had been pushed down as quickly as it had appeared. \"all right, then, \" he said. \"What\u0027s to be donei\"\\n\\n \"I am planning, after the execution, to begin watering the dosage. There will still be three cups a day, but one of them will be half strength. Then, if all goes well, we shall cut a second cup to half strength. Isaac is a strong man, with a strong constitution. I am hopeful his body will continue to improve by its own processes.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going back to the lancet and blister cups, are youi\"\\n\\n \"No, we have crossed those bridges.\"\\n\\n \"What about taking him to Charles Towni Could he stand the tripi\"\\n\\n \"Possibly. Possibly not. I can\u0027t say.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing more can be done for himi\"\\n\\n \"Nothing, \" Shields said. \"It is up to him... and to God. But he does feel better and he does breathe easier. He can communicate, and he is comfortable. These days... with the medicines I have on hand... I would say that is a miracle of sorts.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, \" Matthew said. \"I agree, of course. I... didn\u0027t wish to sound ungrateful for what you\u0027ve done. I believe that under the circumstances you\u0027ve performed with admirable skill.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, sir. Perhaps in this case there was more luck involved than skill... but I have done my best.\"\\n\\n Matthew nodded. \"Oh... have you finished your examination of Linch\u0027s bodyi\"\\n\\n \"I have. I calculate from the thickness of blood that he had been dead some five to seven hours before discovery. His throat wound was the most glaring, but he was also stabbed twice in the back. It was a downward thrust, both stabs piercing his lung on the right side.\"\\n\\n \"So he was stabbed by someone standing behind and over himi\"\\n\\n \"It would appear so. Then I believe his head was pulled backward and the throat wound administered.\"\\n\\n \"He must have been sitting at his desk, \" Matthew said. \"Talking to whoever killed him. Then, when he lay dying on the floor, the slash marks were applied.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, by Satan\u0027s claws. Or by the claws of some unknown demon.\"\\n\\n Matthew was not going to argue the matter with Dr. Shields. Instead, he changed the subject. \"and what of Mr. Bidwelli Has he recoveredi\"\\n\\n \"Sadly, no. He sits at the tavern with Winston as we speak, getting drunker than I\u0027ve ever seen him. I can\u0027t blame him. Everything is crumbling around him, and with more witches yet to be identified... the town will soon be empty. I slept last night - the little I did sleep - with a Bible at both ends of my bed and a dagger in my hand.\"\\n\\n Matthew\u0027s thought was that Shields could use a lancet with far deadlier effect than a dagger. \"You needn\u0027t fear. The damage has been done, and there\u0027s no need for the fox now to do anything but wait.\"\\n\\n \"The foxi Satan, you meani\"\\n\\n \"I mean what I said. Pardon me, doctor. I have some things to tend to.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly. I shall see you later this evening.\"\\n\\n Matthew retired to his room. He drank a cup of water and picked up the ebony-wood compass he\u0027d found in Paine\u0027s house early this morning. It was a splendid instrument, the size of his palm, with a blued steel needle on a printed paper card indicating the degrees of direction. He\u0027d realized the compass was a prime example of the process of magnetism, the needle having been magnetized - by a method he didn\u0027t fully understand - so as to point north.\\n\\n Matthew had made other discoveries in Paine\u0027s bloodless house, not including the body-sized area of floorboards that had been pulled up and then hastily laid down again underneath the pallet. a brown cotton bag with a shoulder strap served to hold his other finds: a knife with a seven-inch-long blade and an ivory handle; a buckskin bladesheath and waistbelt; and a pair of knee-high boots that could be made useable by an inch of padding at the toes. He also found Paine\u0027s pistol and the wheel-lock spanner, but as he knew absolutely nothing about loading, preparing, and firing the temperamental weapon, its use would probably result in his shooting himself in the head.\\n\\n Matthew had much to do, now that he\u0027d decided.\\n\\n Near midday, his decision - which up until that point had been wavering - was made solid. He had walked to the execution field and actually gone fight up to the pyre and the stake. He\u0027d stood there imagining the horror of it, yet his imagination was not so deranged as to permit him a full and complete picture. He could not save Fount Royal, but at least he might cheat the fox of Rachel\u0027s life.\\n\\n It was possible, and he was going to do it.\\n\\n He had been on his way to the gaol, to inform Rachel, when his steps had slowed. Of course she needed to know beforehand... or did shei If his resolve failed tonight, should she be waiting in the dark for a champion who never arrivedi If he tried with all his intelligence and might and could not get the key from Green, should Rachel be waiting, hopeful of freedomi\\n\\n No. He would spare her that torment. He had turned away from the gaol, long before he\u0027d reached its door.\\n\\n Now, in his room, Matthew sat down in his chair with the document box. He opened it and arranged before him three clean sheets of paper, a quill, and the inkpot.\\n\\n He spent a moment arranging his thoughts as well. Then he began writing.\\n\\n Dear Isaac:\\n\\n By now you have discovered that I have taken Rachel from the gaol. I regret any distress this action may cause you, but I have done such because I know her to be innocent yet I cannot offer proof.\\n\\n It is my knowledge that Rachel has been the pawn in a scheme designed to destroy Fount Royal. This was done by a manipulation of the mind called \"animal magnetism\" which I understand will be as much of a puzzle to you as it was to me. Fount Royal\u0027s ratcatcher was not who he appeared to be, but indeed was a master at this process of manipulation. He had the ability to paint pictures in the air, as it were. Pictures that would seem to be true to life, except for the lack of several important details such as I have pointed out in our conversations. alas, I have no proof of this. I learned Linch\u0027s true identity from Mr. David Smythe, of the Red Bull Players, who knew him from a -\\n\\n Matthew stopped. This sounded like utter madness! What was the magistrate going to think when he read these ramblings! Go on he told himself. Just go on.\\n\\n - circus in England several years ago; I do not wish to ramble any further and alarm you. Suffice it to say I was devastated when Mr. Smythe and the players left town, as he was my last hope at proving Rachel guiltless.\\n\\n I have a great concern for the safety of Mr. Bidwell. The person who murdered Linch did so before that true identity could be revealed. That same person has been behind the scheme to destroy Fount Royal all along. I believe I know the reason, but as I have no proof it matters not. Now about Mr. Bidwell\u0027s safety: if Fount Royal is not soon totally abandoned, Mr. Bidwell\u0027s life may be in jeopardy. To save himself, he may have to leave his creation. I am sorry to pass this news on, but it is vital that Mr. Winston remain at Mr. Bidwell\u0027s side day and night. I do trust Mr. Winston.\\n\\n Please believe me, sir, when I tell you I am neither out of my mind nor bewitched. However, I cannot and will not bear to see justice so brutally raped. I am taking Rachel to the Florida country, where she might proclaim herself a runaway slave or English captive and thereby receive sanctuary by the Spanish.\\n\\n Yes, I can hear your bellow, sir. Please calm yourself and let me explain. I plan on returning. When, I do not know. What will happen to me when I do return, I do not know either. It will be your judgment, and I bow before your mercy. at the same time, I would hope that Mr. Smythe might be found and encouraged to speak, as he will make everything clear to you. and, sir, this is very important: make certain you ask Mr. Smythe to explain why his family left the circus. You will understand much.\\n\\n as I said, I do plan on returning. I am an English subject, and I do not wish to give up that privilege.\\n\\n Matthew paused. He had to think about the next part.\\n\\n Sir, if by some chance or the decision of God that I should not return, I wish to here and now thank you for your intercession in my life. I wish to thank you for your lessons, your labors, and -\\n\\n Go on, he told himself.\\n\\n - your love. Perhaps you did not come to the almshouse that day in search of a son. Nevertheless, you found one.\\n\\n Or, more accurately, sir, you crafted one. I would like to think that I made as good a son as Thomas might have been. You see, sir, you have been a magnificent success at crafting a human being, if 1 may speak so grandly of myself. You have given me what I consider to be the greatest gifts: that of self-worth and a knowledge of the worth of others.\\n\\n It is because I understand such worth that I choose to free Rachel from her prison and her unjust fate. No one has made this decision but myself. When I go to the gaol tonight to free her, she will be unaware of my intentions.\\n\\n There is no way you could have known that Rachel was not guilty. You have steadfastly followed the rules and tenets of law as outlined for cases of this nature. Therefore you came to the only conclusion available to you, and performed the necessary action. In doing what I have done this night, I have put on my own iron cloak and performed the only action available to me.\\n\\n I suppose that is everything I need to say. I will close by saying that I wish you good health, a long life, and excellent fortunes, sir. I intend to see you again, at some future date. again, please attend to Mr. Bidwell\u0027s safety. ��\\n\\n I remain Sincerely Your Servant, Matthew -\\n\\n He was about to sign his last name, but instead he made one final dot.\\n\\n Matthew.\\n\\n Folding the pages carefully, he slid them into an envelope he\u0027d taken from the desk in Bidwell\u0027s study. He wrote on the front of the envelope To Magistrate Woodward, then he lit a candle and sealed the letter with a few drops of white wax.\\n\\n It was done.\\n\\n The evening crept up, as evenings will. In the fading purple twilight, with the last bold artist\u0027s stroke of red sun painting the bellies of clouds across the western horizon, Matthew took a lantern and went walking.\\n\\n Though his pace was leisurely, he had a purpose other than taking in a sunset view of the dying town. He had at dinner inquired of Mrs. Nettles where Hannibal Green lived, and had been directed to it by a single clipped and disapproving sentence. The small whitewashed house stood on Industry Street, very near the intersection and the fount. Thankfully it wasn\u0027t as far down the street as Jerusalem\u0027s firelit camp, from which hollering and shrill lamentations issued forth to hold back the devils of night. To the right of Green\u0027s house was a neatly arranged garden of flowers and herbs, indicating either that the giant gaol-keeper was a man of varied interests or he was graced with a wife who had - yes, it was true - a green thumb.\\n\\n The shutters were cracked open only a few inches. Yellow lamplight could be seen within. Matthew had noticed that the shutters of most of the still-occupied houses were closed, presumably on this warm evening to guard against the invasion of those same demons Reverend Jerusalem currently flailed. The streets were all but deserted, save for a few wandering dogs and the occasional figure hurrying from here to there. Matthew also couldn\u0027t fail to note the alarming number of wagons that were packed with furniture, household goods, baskets, and the like, in preparation for a sunrise departure. He wondered how many families would lie on bare floors tonight, restless until the dawn.\\n\\n Matthew stood in the middle of Industry Street and looked from Green\u0027s house toward Bidwell\u0027s mansion, studying the windows that could be seen from this perspective. Then, satisfied with his findings, he walked back the way he\u0027d come.\\n\\n Winston and Bidwell were in the parlor when he arrived, the former reading over figures in a ledgerbook while the latter slumped gray-faced in a chair, his eyes closed and an empty bottle on the floor beside him. Matthew approached with the intention to ask how Bidwell was feeling but Winston lifted a hand in warning, his expression telling Matthew that the master of Fount Royal would not be pleased to awaken and set eyes upon him. Matthew retreated and quietly climbed the stairs.\\n\\n When he entered his room, he found on his dresser a package wrapped in white waxed paper. Opening it he discovered a loaf of dense dark bread, a fist-sized chunk of dried beef, a dozen slices of salted ham, and four sausages. Matthew saw also that on his bed lay three candles, a package of matches and a flint, a corked glass bottle filled with water, and - lo and behold - a coil of cat-gut line with a small lead ballweight and a hook already tied, a small bit of cork pressed onto the sharp point. Mrs. Nettles had done all she could; it was up to him to find the stick.\\n\\n Later that night, Dr. Shields arrived to give the magistrate his third dose. Matthew remained in his room, lying on the bed with his gaze directed to the ceiling. Perhaps an hour after that, the sound of Bidwell\u0027s intoxicated raging came up the stairs along with the sound of his footsteps and those of the person - two persons, it sounded to be - assisting him. Matthew heard Rachel\u0027s name hurled like a curse, and God\u0027s name taken in vain. Bidwell\u0027s voice gradually quieted, until at last it faded to nothing.\\n\\n The house slept, fitfully, on this execution eve.\\n\\n Matthew waited. Finally, when there were no more noises for a long while and his inner clock sensed the midnight hour had been passed, Matthew drew a breath, exhaled it, and stood up.\\n\\n He was terrified, but he was ready.\\n\\n He struck a match, lit his lantern, and put it on the dresser, then he soaped his face and shaved. It had occurred to him that his next opportunity to do so would be several weeks in the future. He used the chamberpot, and then he washed his hands and put on a clean pair of brown stockings, sand-colored breeches, and a fresh white shirt. He tore up another pair of stockings and padded the boot toes. He worked his feet into the boots and pulled them up snugly around his calves. In his bag, grown necessarily heavy with the food and other items, he packed the soap-cake and a change of clothes. He placed the explanatory letter on his bed, where it would be seen. Then he slipped the bag\u0027s strap over his shoulder, picked up the lantern, and quietly opened the door.\\n\\n a feeling of panic struck him. I can yet change my mind, he thought. I can step back two paces, shut the door and - Forgeti No.\\n\\n Matthew shut the door behind him when he entered the hallway. He went into the magistrate\u0027s room and lit the double-candled lantern he had earlier brought there from downstairs. Opening the shutters, he set the lantern on the windowsill.\\n\\n The magistrate made a muffled noise. Not of pain, simply some statement in the justice hall of sleep. Matthew stood beside the bed, looking down at Woodward\u0027s face and seeing not the magistrate but the man who had come to that almshouse and delivered him to a life he never would have imagined.\\n\\n He almost touched Woodward\u0027s shoulder with a fond embrace, but he stayed his hand. Woodward was breathing well, if rather harshly, his mouth partway open. Matthew gave a quick and silent prayer that God would protect the good man\u0027s health and fortunes, and then there was no more time for lingering.\\n\\n In Bidwell\u0027s study, that damned floorboard squealed again and almost sent Matthew out of his stolen boots. He lifted the map from its nail on the wall, carefully removed it from its frame and then folded it and put it down into his bag.\\n\\n Downstairs - after an agonizingly slow descent meant to avoid any telltale thumps and squeaks that might bring Bidwell staggering out into the hallway - Matthew paused in the parlor to shine his lantern on the face of the mantel clock. It was near quarter to one.\\n\\n He left the mansion, closed the door, and without a backward glance set off under a million stars. He kept the lantern low at his side, and shielded by his body in case the gate watchman - if indeed there remained in town anyone brave or foolish enough to sit up there all night - might happen to spy the moving flame and set off a bell-ringing alarm.\\n\\n at the intersection he turned onto Truth Street and proceeded directly to the Howarth house. It was wretched in its abandonment, and made even more fearsome by the fact that Daniel Howarth had been found brutally murdered nearby. as Matthew opened the door and crossed the threshold, shining the lantern before him, he couldn\u0027t help but wonder that a ghost with a torn throat should be wandering within, forever searching for Rachel.\\n\\n Ghosts there were none, but the rats had moved in. The gleam of red eyes and rodent teeth glittering under twitching whiskers greeted him, though he was certainly not a welcome guest. The rats scurried for their holes, and though Matthew had seen only five or six it sounded as if a duke\u0027s army of them festered the walls. He searched for and found the floorboard that had been lifted up to display the hidden poppets, and then he followed the lantern\u0027s glow into another room that held a bed. Its sheets and blanket were still crumpled and lying half on the floor from the March morning when Rachel was taken away.\\n\\n Matthew found a pair of trunks, one containing Daniel\u0027s clothing and the other for Rachel\u0027s. He chose two dresses for her, both with long hems and full sleeves, as that was both the fashion and her favor. One dress was of a cream-colored, light material that he thought would be suitable for travelling in warm weather, and the other a stiffer dark blue printed material that impressed him as being of sturdy all-purpose use. at the bottom of the trunk were two pairs of Rachel\u0027s no-nonsense black shoes. Matthew put a pair of the shoes into his bag, the garments over his arm, and gladly left the sad, broken house to its current inhabitants.\\n\\n His next destination was the gaol. He didn\u0027t go inside yet, however. There was still a major obstacle to deal with, and its name was Hannibal Green. Pinpricks of sweat had formed on his cheeks and forehead, and his insides had jellied at the thought of what could go wrong with his plan.\\n\\n He left the garments and the shoulderbag in the knee-high grass beside the gaol. If all went as he hoped, he wouldn\u0027t be gone long enough for any rodent to find and investigate the package of food. Then he set his mind to the task ahead and began walking to Green\u0027s house.\\n\\n as he went west on Truth Street he glanced quickly around and behind, just as a matter of reassurance - and suddenly he stopped in his tracks, his heart giving a vicious kick. He stood staring behind him, toward the gaol.\\n\\n a light. Not there now, but he thought he\u0027d seen a very brief glow there on the right side of the street, perhaps seventy or eighty feet away.\\n\\n He paused, waiting, his heart slamming so hard he feared Bidwell might hear it and think a night-travelling drum corps had come to town.\\n\\n If a light had indeed been displayed, it was gone. Or hidden when someone carrying it had dodged behind the protection of a hedge or wall, he thought grimly.\\n\\n and another thought came to him, this one with dark consequences: had a citizen seen the flame of his lantern and emerged from a house to follow himi He realized someone might think he was either Satan incarnate or a lesser demon, prowling Fount Royal for another victim here in the dead of night. a single pistol shot would end his plans and possibly his life, but a single shout would have the same effect.\\n\\n He waited. The urge to blow out his lamp was upon him, but that might truly be an admittance of foul deeds in progress. He scanned the dark. No further light appeared, if it had been there at all.\\n\\n Time was passing. He had to continue his task. Matthew went on, from time to time casting a backward glance but seeing no evidence that he was being tracked. Presently he found himself in front of Green\u0027s house.\\n\\n Now was the moment of truth. If he failed in the next few moments, everything would be ended.\\n\\n He swallowed down a lump of fear and approached the door. Then, before he could lose his nerve, he balled up his fist and knocked. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-37.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \\n Judgment of the Witch \\n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
