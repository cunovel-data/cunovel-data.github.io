{"id":85918,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"WHO... WHO\u0027S THEREi\" Matthew was taken aback. Green actually sounded frightened. Such was the double power of murder and fear, to imprison persons inside their own homes. \"It\u0027s Matthew Corbett, sir, \" he said, emboldened by the tremor in Green\u0027s voice. \"I have to speak with you.\" \"Corbetti My Lord, boy! Do you know the houri\" \"Yes, sir, I do.\" and here was the beginning of the necessary lie. \"I\u0027ve been sent by Magistrate Woodward.\" amazing, how such a falsehood could roll off a desperate tongue! a woman\u0027s voice spoke within, the sound muffled, and Green answered her with, \"It\u0027s that magistrate\u0027s clerk! I\u0027ll have to open it!\" a latch was thrown and the door cracked. Green looked out, his red mane wild and his beard a fright. When he saw that it was only Matthew standing there and not an eight-foot-tall demon he opened the door wider. \"What\u0027s the need, boyi\" Matthew saw a rotund but not unpleasant-looking woman standing in the room behind him. She was holding a lantern in one hand and the other arm cradled a wide-eyed, red-haired child two or three years of age. \"The magistrate wishes to have Madam Howarth brought before him.\" \"Whati Nowi\" \"Yes, now.\" Matthew glanced around; no other lights had appeared in the houses surrounding Green\u0027s, which was either a testament to fear or the fact that they had been abandoned. \"She\u0027ll be led to the stake in three or four hours!\" \"That\u0027s why he wishes to see her now, to offer her a last chance for confession. It\u0027s a necessary part of the law.\" again, an able-tongued lie. \"He\u0027s waiting for her.\" Matthew motioned toward Bidwell\u0027s mansion. Green scowled, but he took the bait. He emerged from his house, wearing a long gray nightshirt. He looked in the direction of the mansion and saw the light in the upstairs window. \"He would have preferred to go to the gaol, but he\u0027s too ill, \" Matthew explained. \"Therefore I\u0027m to accompany you to the gaol to remove the prisoner, and from there we shall escort her to the magistrate.\" Green was obviously dismayed at this request, but since he was the gaol-keeper and this was official business he could not refuse. \"all right, then, \" he said. \"Give me a minute to dress.\" \"a question for you, please, \" Matthew said before Green could enter the house again. \"Can you tell me if the watchtowers are manned tonighti\" Green snorted. \"Would you sit up there tonight, alone, so somethin\u0027 might swoop in and get you like Linch was goti Every man, woman and child in Fount Royal - left in Fount Royal, I mean to say - are huddled in their houses behind latched doors and closed shutters!\" \"I thought as much, \" Matthew said. \"It\u0027s a shame, then, that you should have to leave your wife and child alone. Undefended, I mean. But then again, it is an official request.\" Green looked stricken. He rumbled, \"Yes, it is. So there\u0027s no use jawin\u0027 about it.\" \"Well... I might make a suggestion, \" Matthew offered. \"This is a very precarious time, I know. Therefore you might give me the key, and I\u0027ll take Madam Howarth to the magistrate. She\u0027ll probably not need to be returned to her cell before the execution hour. Of course, I wouldn\u0027t care to face her without a pistol or sword. Do you have eitheri\" Green stared him in the face. \"Hold a minute, \" he said. \"I\u0027ve heard talk you were sweet on the witch.\" \"You havei Well... yes, it was true. Was true. She blinded me to her true nature while I was imprisoned with her. But I\u0027ve since realized - with the magistrate\u0027s help - the depth of her powers.\" \"There are some who say you might be turned to a demon, \" Green said. \"Lucretia Vaughan spoke such at the reverend\u0027s camp on the Sabbath.\" \"Oh... did shei\" That damned woman! \"Yes, and that you might be in league with the witch. and Reverend Jerusalem said he knew you to be desirous of her body.\" It was very difficult for Matthew to maintain a calm expres-sion, when inside he was raging. \"Mr. Green, \" he said, \"it was I who delivered the execution decree to the witch. If I were truly a demon, I would have entranced the magistrate to prevent him from finding her guilty. I had every opportunity to do so.\" \"The reverend said it could\u0027a been you made Woodward sick, hopin\u0027 he\u0027d die \u0027fore he could speak the decree.\" \"Was I the central subject of the reverend\u0027s rantingsi If so, I should at least ask for a percentage of the coin he made off my name!\" \"The central subject was the Devil, \" Green said. \"and how we\u0027re to get out of this town still wearin\u0027 our skins.\" \"after the reverend is done, you\u0027ll still have your skins, but your wallets will be missing.\" He was wandering from the point of his mission, and doing himself no good. \"But please... there is the magistrate\u0027s request to consider. as I said, if you\u0027ll give me the key, I might - \" \"No, \" Green interrupted. \"Much as I despise to leave my home, the prisoner\u0027s my charge, and no hand shall unlock her cage but my own. Then I\u0027ll escort the both of you to the magistrate.\" \"Well... Mr. Green... I think that, in light of the reason to stay and defend your - \" But Matthew was left talking to the air, as the giant gaol-keeper turned and entered his house. His plan, tenuous at best, had already begun unravelling. Obviously Green was wary of Matthew\u0027s intentions. also, the red-bearded monolith was faithful to duty even to the point of leaving his wife and child on this Satan-haunted eve. The man was to be commended, if Matthew wasn\u0027t so busy cursing him. In a few moments Green emerged again, wearing his nightshirt over his breeches and heavy-soled boots on his feet. around his neck was the leather cord and two keys. He carried a lantern in his left hand and his right paw brandished, to Matthew\u0027s great discomfort, a sword that might be used to behead an ox. \"Remember, \" he said to his wife, \"keep this door latched! and if anyone even tries to get in, let out the loudest holler your lungs ever birthed!\" He closed the door, she latched it, and he said to Matthew, \"all right, off with you! You walk ahead!\" It was time, Matthew thought, for his second plan. The only problem was that there was no second plan. He led Green toward the gaol. He didn\u0027t look but, from the way the flesh on the back of his neck crawled, he assumed Green kept the sword\u0027s point aimed at it. The barking of a dog further up on Harmony Street caused a second canine to reply from Industry, which Matthew knew would be no soothing melody to Green\u0027s nerves. \"Why wasn\u0027t I told about thisi\" Green asked, as they approached the gaol. \"If it is such a necessary part of the law. Couldn\u0027t it have been done in daylighti\" \"The law states the accused in a witchcraft trial shall be afforded the opportunity for confession no more than six hours and no less than two hours before execution. It is called the law of... um... confessiato.\" If Jerusalem could get away with his rite of sanctimonity, Matthew figured he might employ a similar stratagem. \"Usually the magistrate would visit the accused\u0027s cell in the company of a clergyman, but in this case it is impossible.\" \"Yes, that makes sense, \" Green admitted. \"But still... why wasn\u0027t I told to expect iti\" \"Mr. Bidwell was supposed to inform you. Didn\u0027t hei\" \"No. He\u0027s been ill.\" \"Well, \" Matthew said with a shrug, \"there you have it.\" They entered the gaol, Matthew still leading. Rachel spoke to the lights instead of the persons carrying them, her voice wan and resigned to her fate. \"Is it timei\" \"almost, madam, \" Matthew said stiffly. \"The magistrate wishes to see you, to allow you opportunity for confession.\" \"For confessioni\" She stood up. \"Matthew, what\u0027s this abouti\" \"I suggest you be silent, witch, for your own good. Mr. Green, open the cell.\" He stepped aside, feverishly trying to think of what he was going to do when the key had turned. \"You step over there, away from me, \" Green instructed, and Matthew did. Rachel came to the bars, her face and hair dirty, her amber eyes piercing him. \"I asked you a question. What is this abouti\" \"It is about your life after you leave this place, witch. Your af-tetlife, in a faraway realm. Now please hold your tongue.\" Green slid the key into its lock, turned it, and opened the cage\u0027s door. \"all right. Come out.\" Rachel hesitated, gripping the bats. \"It\u0027s the law of confessiassho! Come on, the magistrate\u0027s waitin\u0027!\" Matthew\u0027s mind was racing. He saw the two buckets in Rachel\u0027s cell, one for drinking water and the other for bodily functions. Well, it wasn\u0027t much but it was all he could think of. \"By God!\" he said, \"I think the witch wants to defy us, Mr. Green! I think she refuses to come out!\" He stabbed an urgent finger at her, motioning toward the rear of the cell. \"Will you come out, witch, or shall we drag youi\" \"I don\u0027t...\" \"By God, Mr. Green! She\u0027s defying the magistrate, even at this final hour! Will you come out, or will you make things difficulti\" He added the emphasis on the last three words, and he saw that Rachel was still puzzled but she\u0027d realized what he wanted her to do. She retreated from the bars, stopping only when her back met the wall. \"Matthewi\" she said. \"What game is thisi\" \"a game you will regret, madam! and don\u0027t think speaking so familiarly to me shall prevent Mr. Green from going in there and dragging you out! Mr. Green, have at it!\" Green didn\u0027t budge. He leaned on his sword. \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 in there and risk gettin\u0027 my eyeballs scratched out. Or worse. You want her so bloody bad, you go get her.\" Matthew felt the wind leave his sails. This was becoming a farce worthy of a drunken playwright\u0027s most fevered scribblings. \"Very well then, sir.\" He clenched his teeth and held out his hand. \"Your sword, pleasei\" Green\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"I\u0027ll go in and drag her out, \" Matthew pressed on, \"but you don\u0027t expect me to enter a tiger\u0027s den without a weapon, do youi Where\u0027s your Christian mercyi\" Green said nothing, and did not move. \"Matthewi\" Rachel said. \"What\u0027s this - \" \"Hush, witch!\" Matthew answered, his gaze locked with the giant\u0027s. \"Ohhhhh, no.\" a half-smile slipped across Green\u0027s mouth. \"No, sirrah. I ain\u0027t givin\u0027 up my sword. You must think me a proper fool, if you\u0027d believe I\u0027d let it out of my hand.\" \"Well, someone has got to go in there and pull her out! It seems to me it should be the man with the sword!\" By now Matthew was a human sweatpond. Still Green hesitated. Matthew said, with an exasperated air, \"Shall I go to the magistrate and tell him the execution will be postponed because the law of confessiato cannot be appliedi\" \"She doesn\u0027t care to confess!\" Green said. \"The magistrate can\u0027t force her to!\" \"That\u0027s not the point. The law says...\" Think, think! \"... the accused must be afforded an opportunity, in the presence of a magistrate, whether they want to confess or not. Go on, please! We\u0027re wasting time!\" \"That\u0027s a damn ridiculous law, \" Green muttered. \"Sounds just like somethin\u0027 from a bunch of highwigs.\" He aimed his sword at Rachel. \"all right, witch! If you won\u0027t move on your own will, you\u0027ll move at a prick on your arse!\" Sweat glistening on his face, he entered the cell. \"Look how she steps back!\" Quickly, Matthew set his lantern on the floor and entered directly behind him. \"Look how she hugs the wall! Defiant to a fault!\" \"Come on!\" Green stopped, motioning with the sword. \"Out with you, damn it!\" \"Don\u0027t let her make a fool of you!\" Matthew insisted. He looked down at the buckets and made the choice of the one that was about half-full of water. \"Go on!\" \"Don\u0027t rush me, boy!\" Green snapped. Rachel had slid away from him along the wall toward the bars of the cell Matthew had occupied during his incarceration. Green went after her, but cautiously, the lantern in his left hand and the sword in his right. Matthew picked up the water bucket. Oh God, he thought. Now or never! \"I don\u0027t want to draw blood, \" Green warned Rachel as he neared her, \"but if I have to I\u0027ll - \" Matthew said sharply, \"Look here, Mr. Green!\" The giant gaol-keeper whipped his head around. Matthew was already moving. He took two steps and flung the water into Green\u0027s face. It hit the behemoth directly, blinding him for an instant but an instant of blindness was all Matthew had wanted. He followed the water by swinging the empty bucket at Green\u0027s head. Wham! went the sound of the blow, wood against skull, and skull won. The sturdy bucket fairly burst to pieces on impact, leaving Matthew gripping the length of rope that had served as its handle. Green staggered backward, past Rachel as she scrambled aside. He dropped the lantern and collided with the bars with a force that made the breath whoosh from his lungs. His eyes had rolled back in his head. The sword slipped from his fingers. Then Green toppled to his knees in the straw, the floor trembling as he hit. \"Have you... have you gone madi\" was all Rachel could think to say. \"I\u0027m getting you out of here.\" Matthew bent, picked up the sword - a heavy beast - and pushed it between the bars into the next cell. \"Getting me... outi What\u0027re you - i\" \"I\u0027m not going to let you burn, \" he said, turning to face her. \"I have clothes for you, and supplies. I\u0027m taking you to the Florida country.\" \"The... Florida...\" She stepped back, and Matthew thought she might fall as Green had. \"You... must be mad!\" \"The Spanish will give you sanctuary there, if you pass yourself as a runaway slave or English captive. Now, I really don\u0027t think we have time to debate this, as I have crossed my own personal point of no return.\" \"But... why are you - \" She was interrupted by a groan from the awakening gaol-keeper, who was still on his knees. Matthew looked at Green in alarm and saw his eyes fluttering. Then, suddenly, Green\u0027s bloodshot eyes opened wide. They darted from Matthew to Rachel and back again - and then Green\u0027s mouth opened to deliver a yell that would awaken not only Fount Royal but the sleepers in Charles Town. In a heartbeat, Matthew grabbed up a double-handful of straw and jammed it deeply into Green\u0027s mouth even as the yell began its exit. Perhaps a syllable escaped before the straw did its work. Green began to gag and choke, and Matthew followed the act with a blow to the gaol-keeper\u0027s face that seemed to do not a whit of damage except to Matthew\u0027s knuckles. Then, still dazed and his voice unavailable, Green grasped the front of Matthew\u0027s shirt and his left forearm, lifted him off the floor like one of the demonic poppets, and flung him against the wall. Now it was Matthew\u0027s turn to lose his breath as he crashed against the timbers. He slid down to the floor, his ribs near caved in, and saw through a haze of pain that Green was reaching through the bars to grasp the sword\u0027s handle, bits of straw flying around his face as he tried to cough the stuff out. Green\u0027s fingers closed on the weapon, and he began drawing it toward himself. Matthew looked at Rachel, who was still too stunned at this turn of events to react. Then he saw the wooden bench beside her, and he hauled himself up. Green almost had the sword pulled through. His large hand, clasping the sword\u0027s grip, had lodged between the bars. He gave a mighty heave, near tearing the flesh from his paw, and suddenly the sword was again his protector. But not for long, if Matthew had his way. Matthew had picked up the bench, and now he slammed it down across Green\u0027s head and shoulders with all his strength. The bench went the way of the bucket, exploding upon impact. Green shuddered and made a muffled groan, his throat still clogged, and again the sword fell from his spasming fingers. Matthew reached down to get that damned blade and do away with it once more - and Green\u0027s hands, the right one bruised and blackening from its contest with the bars, seized his throat. Green\u0027s face was mottled crimson, the eyes wild with rage and terror, a stream of blood running from the top of his head down to his eyebrows and straw clenched between his teeth. He stood up to his full height, lifting Matthew by the throat, and began to strangle him as surely as if Matthew had been dangling from a gallows-tree. Matthew\u0027s legs kicked and he pushed against Green\u0027s bearded chin with both hands, but the giant\u0027s grasp was killing him. Rachel now saw that she must act or Matthew would die. She saw the sword, but her wish was not to kill to save. Instead she launched herself at Green\u0027s back like a wildcat, scratching and pummelling at his face. He turned and with a motion that was almost casual flung her off, after which he continued his single-minded execution as Matthew thrashed ineffectually. a shimmering red haze was starting to envelope Matthew\u0027s head. He cocked back his right fist, judging where he should strike to inflict the most pain. It hardly mattered. Green gave the threatening fist a quick glance and a straw-lipped sneer and his crushing hands tightened even more. The blow was delivered, with a sound like an axe striking hardwood. Green\u0027s head snapped back, his mouth opened, and a tooth flew out, followed by a spatter of blood. Instantly the giant\u0027s hands loosened. Matthew dropped to the floor. He clutched at his throat, his lungs heaving. Green turned in a dazed circle, as if he were dancing a reel with an invisible partner. He coughed once, then again, and straw burst from his throat. His eyes showing only red-tinged whites, he fell like a hammer-knocked steer and lay stretched out on the floor. It had been one hell of a blow. However, it had been delivered before Matthew\u0027s own puny offering. Mrs. Nettles spat on her knuckles and wrung her hand. \"Ow, \" she said. \"I\u0027ve nae hit a harder head!\" Matthew croaked, \"Youi\" \"Me, \" she answered. \"I heard you up \u0027n\u0027 about in Mr. Bidwell\u0027s study. I thought I\u0027d tag along, keep a watch o\u0027er ye. Near saw my lantern, \u0027fore I dowsed it.\" She looked at Rachel, and then cast a disapproving eye around the cell. \"Lord, what a filth-pot!\" Rachel was so amazed at all this, when she\u0027d been preparing herself for the final morn, that she felt she must be in some strange dream even though she\u0027d not slept since early afternoon. \"Here, c\u0027mon.\" Mrs. Nettles reached down, grasped Matthew\u0027s hand, and hauled him up. \"You\u0027d best be off. I\u0027ll make sure Mr. Green keeps his silence.\" \"You\u0027re not going to hurt him, are youi I mean... any more than you already havei\" \"No, but I\u0027m gonna strip him naked and bind his wrists and ankles. His mouth, too. That nightshirt ought ta give up some ropes. But it wouldn\u0027t do for him ta ever know I was here. Go on now, the both of you!\" Rachel shook her head, still unbelieving. \"I thought... I was to burn today.\" \"You shall yet burn, and the young man too, if you do\u0027nae go.\" Mrs. Nettles was already pulling the nightshirt off Green\u0027s slumbering body. \"We have to hurry.\" Still rubbing his bruised throat, Matthew took Rachel\u0027s hand and guided her toward the threshold. \"I have clothes and shoes for you outside.\" \"Why are you doing thisi\" Rachel asked Mrs. Nettles. \"You\u0027re Bidwell\u0027s woman!\" \"Nae, lass, \" came the reply. \"I am employed by Mr. Bidwell, but I am my own woman. and I am doin\u0027 this \u0027cause I never thought you guilty, no matter what was claimed. also... I am rightin\u0027 an old wrong. Off with ye!\" Matthew picked up his lantern. \"Thank you, Mrs. Nettles!\" he said. \"You saved my life!\" \"No, sir.\" She continued her methodical stripping of Green, her back turned to Matthew. \"I just sentenced you both ta... whatever\u0027s out there.\" Outside, Rachel staggered and held out her arms as if to embrace the night and the stars, her face streaked with tears. Matthew grasped hold of her hand again, and hurried her to where he\u0027d left the shoulderbag, garments, and shoes. \"You can change clothes after we get out, \" he said, slipping the bag\u0027s strap over his shoulder. \"Will you carry thesei\" He gave her the garments. \"I thought the light one would be best for travelling.\" She gave a soft gasp as she took the dresses, and she caressed the cream-colored garment as if it were the returning to her of a wonderful treasure. Which it was. \"Matthew... you\u0027ve brought my wedding dress!\" If he\u0027d had the time to spare, he might have laughed or he might have cried, but which one he was never to know. \"Your shoes, \" he said, giving them to her. \"Put them on, we\u0027re going through rough country.\" They started off, Matthew leading the way toward Bidwell\u0027s house and the slave quarters. He had considered going out the front gate, as there was no watchman, but the gate\u0027s locking timber was too heavy for one man, and certainly for one man who had nearly been rib-busted and choked to death. He looked up at the lantern in Isaac\u0027s window and wished the man might truly know what he meant to Matthew. alas, a note was a poor goodbye but the only one available to him. Through the slave quarters, Matthew and Rachel moved as if they were dark, flying shadows. Perhaps the door of John Goode\u0027s house cracked open a few inches, or perhaps not. Freedom awaited, but first there was the swamp.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-38.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) Judgment of the Witch The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
