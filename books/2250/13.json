{"id":85893,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"BY THE TIME THE MaGISTRaTE reached Dr. Shields\u0027s infirmary, which was a chalkwhite painted house on Harmony Street, he felt as if he were walking in a fog cloud. This dazed, opaque sensation was more than his physical distress; it was his mental burden, as well.\n Woodward had just left the house of Lucretia Vaughan. Mrs. Vaughan had been summoned to the door by a lovely blonde girl of sixteen or thereabouts, whom the elder lady had introduced as her daughter Cherise. Upon returning the basket containing teapot and cups, Woodward had inquired why Mrs. Vaughan had wished the reddish-brown cup to be broken to pieces by Rachel Howarth.\n \"Surely you understand, being a sophisticated man of the city,\" Mrs. Vaughan had said, \"that now the cup is much more valuable than before.\"\n \"Valuablei\" he\u0027d asked. \"How is it that fragments of a cup are worth more than the wholei\"\n \"Because she broke it,\" came the reply, which only further puzzled the magistrate. It must have shown on his face, because Mrs. Vaughan explained, \"after the witch is put to death and Fount Royal is steadied again, the citizens of this town might wish to possess some token of the terrible ordeal we have been strong enough to endure.\" She gave a smile that Woodward could only describe as chilling. \"It will take time, of course, but with the proper presentation the bits of broken cup might be sold as charms of good fortune.\"\n \"Pardon mei\" Woodward had then felt the fog closing in around his head.\n \"I chose the nearest hue to blood-red that I could find,\" Mrs. Vaughan said, her tone of voice that of a sharper to a dimwit. \"The blood of the witch. Or the scarlet tears of the witch. I haven\u0027t yet settled on one or the other. It\u0027s a matter of imagination, do you seei\"\n \"I . . . fear my imagination isn\u0027t as developed as yours,\" Woodward said, a thick knot seemingly clogged in his throat.\n \"Thank you for returning these so promptly. at the appropriate time I can advertise that the pieces of cup broken by the witch were given to my own hand by the magistrate who executed her.\" Mrs. Vaughan now exhibited a slight frown. \"Tell me - what\u0027s to become of the straw poppetsi\"\"The straw poppetsi\" he\u0027d echoed.\n \"Yes. Surely you\u0027ll have no need of them after the witch is dead, will youi\"\n \"Excuse me,\" Woodward had said. \"I really must go.\"\n and so he found himself - fogheaded under the gray-plated sky - reaching for the bellcord at Dr. Shields\u0027s door. above the door, a sign painted in the medical colors of red, white, and blue announced this to be the shop of Benj. Shields, Surgeon Barber. Woodward pulled the cord and waited, and presently the door was opened by a portly, broad-faced woman with curly dark brown hair. He introduced himself, asked to be seen by Dr. Shields, and was admitted into a sparsely appointed parlor, the most notable feature of it being a gilded birdcage that held two yellow canaries. The woman, whose ample figure was contained by a beige dress and apron that might have served as a settler\u0027s tent, went through a door at the other side of the room and Woodward was left with the birds.\n But not for very long, however, as within a minute or two the door opened again and the doctor appeared, his clothing a white blouse with sleeves rolled up, a wine-colored waistcoat, and charcoal-gray breeches. He wore his round-lensed spectacles, his long hair trailing over his shoulders. \"Magistrate!\" he said, and offered his hand. \"To what do I owe this pleasurei\"\n \"Would that pleasure was the purpose,\" Woodward answered, his voice - though quite husky - now in a fragile condition. \"I fear I\u0027ve been visited by ill health.\"\n \"Open your mouth, please,\" Shields instructed. \"angle your head back a bit, if you will.\" He peered in. \"Oh my,\" he said, after the briefest of inspections. \"Your throat appears quite swollen and aflame. You\u0027re in some pain, I would presume.\"\n \"Yes. Very much.\"\n \"No doubt. Come with me, let\u0027s have a better look.\"\n Woodward followed the doctor through the door and along a hallway, past one room where there stood a basin of water, a chair, and a leather strop to keen the razor for the barbering duties, and past a second room that held three narrow beds. a young female with a plaster bandage around her right arm and her torpid face discolored by bruises lay in one of the beds, being fed a bowl of soup by the woman who\u0027d admitted Woodward. He realized it must be Noles\u0027s unfortunate wife, who\u0027d suffered the wrath of his carpet-beater.\n a door into a third room further down the hallway was opened, and Shields said, \"Sit there, please,\" as he motioned toward a chair positioned near the single window. The magistrate seated himself. Shields opened the shutters to let in the misty gray illumination. \"My soul rose at the dawn,\" the doctor said, as he turned away to prepare the examination. \"Then it fell back to earth and resides now in a puddle of mud.\"\n \"Myself the same. Will a full day of sun never again shine on the New Worldi\"\"a debatable question, it seems.\"\n Woodward considered the room into which he\u0027d been led. It appeared to be both the physician\u0027s study and his apothecary. On one side of the chamber stood a timeworn desk and chair, next to which was a bookcase of what looked to be old medical tomes, by their thickness and the dark solemnity of their bindings. Opposite those furnishings was a long workbench built to the height of Dr. Shields\u0027s waist. atop the bench, which had perhaps a dozen small drawers with ivory pulls constructed along its length, was a glassblower\u0027s nightmare of arcane bottles, beakers, jars, and the like, along with a set of measuring scales and various other instruments. On the wall, too, were mounted shelves that held more bottles and jars, many of the vessels murky with fluids and potions.\n Shields scrubbed his hands with soap in a waterbowl. \"You\u0027ve just recently come into this conditioni Or was it bothersome before you reached Fount Royali\"\n \"Just recently. It began as a slight soreness, but now ... I can hardly swallow.\"\n \"Hmmm.\" He dried his hands upon a cloth and then opened one of the bench\u0027s drawers. \"We must go down into your throat.\" He turned toward the magistrate again, and Woodward saw with a start that Shields was holding a pair of clippers suitable for shearing treelimbs.\n \"Oh,\" Shields said with a slight smile at Woodward\u0027s alarm. \"What I mean to say is, we must look down into your throat.\" With the clippers he snipped a candle in two, then laid the dread shears aside and fitted one of the candle stubs into a small metal holder with a mirror fixed behind the flame so as to amplify its light. He lit the candle from a match, then took another instrument out of a drawer and positioned the desk\u0027s chair in front of his patient. \"Open wide, please.\"\n Woodward did. Shields held the candle near the magistrate\u0027s mouth and studied the scene. \"Quite raw, it appears. are you having difficulty breathing as welli\"\"It is a labor, yes.\"\n \"Lean your head back, let me inspect your nostrils.\" Shields gave a grunt as he peered up that formidable proboscis. \"Yes, quite swollen there, too. The right much more than the left, but the passage of air is equally endangered. Your mouth open again.\"\n This time when Woodward obeyed, the doctor inserted a long metal probe that at its end held a square of cotton secured by a clamp. \"Refrain from swallowing, please.\" The cotton swabbed along the back of Woodward\u0027s throat, and the magistrate was compelled to squeeze his eyes shut and fight the urge to gag or cry out as the pain was so acute. at last the probe was withdrawn, and Woodward saw - through a veil of tears - that a pasty yellow fluid had soaked the cotton.\n \"I\u0027ve seen this ailment before, in varying degrees of severity,\" the doctor said. \"Your condition lies at about the midpoint. Such is the price one pays for habitation at the edge of a swamp, enduring fetid air and damp humours. This constriction and drainage is therefore inflicting extreme irritation to your throat.\" He stood up and laid the probe and yellow-soaked cotton on the benchtop. \"I\u0027ll paint your throat with a tonic that should relieve much of the pain. I have also a remedy for the breathing obstruction.\" as he was speaking, he removed the tainted cotton and inserted a fresh square into the clamp.\n \"Thank God I can find some relief!\" Woodward said. \"It was sheer torture having to speak at the testimony today!\"\n \"ah, the testimony.\" Shields selected a bottle from the wall-shelf and removed its stopper. \"Jeremiah Buckner was the first witnessi Mr. Winston told me you were beginning with him.\"\"That\u0027s correct.\"\n \"I know his story.\" Shields returned to his chair, carrying bottle and probe but minus the mirrored candle this time. \"It\u0027s enough to shock the hair off a wigstand, isn\u0027t iti\"\"I\u0027ve never heard anything more sickening.\"\n \"Open, please.\" Shields dipped the cotton into the bottle and brought it out wet with a dark brown liquid. \"This may sting a bit, but it\u0027s the rawness being soothed.\" He slid the probe in and Woodward braced himself. \"Steady, now.\" The liquid-soaked cotton made contact. Woodward almost bit down on the probe, so fierce was the pain. New tears sprang to his eyes, his hands curled into fists, and he found himself thinking that this must be akin to a burning at the stake but without the smoke. \"Steady, steady,\" the doctor said, pausing to dip the cotton into the bottle again. The contest with agony began once more, and Woodward realized his head was starting to twist on his neck in an involuntary effort to escape; thus it was akin, he thought in a fevered sort of humor, to being hanged as well as being burnt.\n In another moment, though, the awful pain did begin to subside. Shields kept redipping the cotton into the bottle and swabbing liquid liberally over the back of Woodward\u0027s throat. \"You should be feeling some relief by now,\" Shields said. \"are youi\" Woodward nodded, tears streaking his face.\n \"This is my own mixture: Jesuit\u0027s Bark, limonum, and opium, made more firm by a base of oxymel. It\u0027s shown very excellent results in the past. I\u0027m even considering applying for a label.\" He made a few more applications of the tonic and then, satisfied that the magistrate\u0027s throat was well done, sat back with a smile. \"There! I wish all my patients were as sturdy as you, sir! ah, just a moment!\" He got up, went to one of the drawers, and returned with a linen cloth. \"You might wish to use this.\"\n \"Thank you,\" Woodward croaked. He used the cloth as it was intended, to blot his tears.\n \"If your condition worsens in the next few days, we shall apply the tonic again at a greater strength. But I expect you\u0027ll feel much more yourself by tomorrow evening. . . . Elias Garrick is to be your next witnessi\"\"Yes.\"\n \"He\u0027s already told you his story. Why do you need to see himi\"\"His testimony must be spoken onto the record.\"\n Dr. Shields peered over his spectacles, looking every bit the barn owl. \"I must warn you that prolonged speaking will further harm your throat. You should rest it, by all means.\"\n \"I\u0027m seeing Garrick on Monday. I\u0027ll have the Sabbath to rest.\"\n \"Even Monday might be too soon. I\u0027d recommend a week of as little speech as absolutely necessary.\"\n \"Impossible!\" Woodward said. \"I\u0027d be a fine magistrate who couldn\u0027t speak!\"\n \"Be that as it may, I\u0027m simply giving you my advice.\" He again went to the workbench, where he put aside the probe and opened a blue ceramic jar. \"This remedy will aid your air passages,\" he said, returning to Woodward with the jar. \"Take one.\"\n Woodward looked into the jar and saw what appeared to be a dozen or so small brown sticks, each perhaps two inches in length. \"What are theyi\"\n \"a botanical remedy, from the hemp plant. I grow and cure the weed myself, as it seems to be one of the few crops that will thrive in this atrocious climate. Go ahead; you\u0027ll find it quite a useful drug.\"\n Woodward selected one of the sticks, which had a rather oily texture, and started to slide it into his mouth, intending to chew it. \"No, no!\" Shields said. \"It\u0027s smoked, much as one would puff a pipe.\"\"Smokedi\"\n \"Yes. Except for one difference: the smoke is pulled deeply into the lungs, let settle, and then slowly exhaled.\" Shields brought the candle over. \"Put it between your lips and draw on it.\" The magistrate obeyed, and Shields touched the candle\u0027s flame to the stick\u0027s slightly twisted end. a thin plume of bluish smoke began to rise. \"Draw it in,\" Shields instructed. \"It will do you no good if you don\u0027t.\"\n Woodward inhaled as deeply as possible. He felt the bitter-tasting smoke sear his lungs, and then the bout of coughing that burst forth from him brought fresh tears. He bent over, coughing and weeping.\n \"The first several inhalations are difficult,\" the doctor admitted. \"Here, I\u0027ll show you how it\u0027s done.\" He seated himself, chose one of the hemp sticks, and lit it. Then he inhaled with a familiar ease. after a slight pause, he let the smoke exit his mouth. \"You seei It does take some practise.\"\n Even so, Woodward noted that Shields\u0027s eyes were glistening. He tried it again, and again was attacked by a coughing fit.\n Shields said, \"You may be taking in too much smoke. Small doses are the better.\"\"Do you insist I suffer this remedyi\"\n \"I do. You\u0027ll breathe so much more freely.\" Shields inhaled again, uptilted his chin, and let the smoke drift toward the ceiling.\n Woodward tried it a third time. The coughing was not so severe. The fourth time, he coughed only twice. By the sixth inhalation, there did seem to be some lessening of the pressure in his head.\n Dr. Shields had almost smoked his down to the halfway point. He regarded the burning tip, and then he stared fixedly at Woodward. \"You know, Magistrate,\" he said after a long silence, \"you\u0027re a very fine man.\"\"and why is that, siri\"\n \"Because you take Robert Bidwell\u0027s bluff and bluster without complaint. You must be a fine man. By God, you must be verging on sanctity.\"\"I think not. I\u0027m just a servant\"\n \"Oh, more than a servant! You\u0027re master of the law, which makes you Bidwell\u0027s superior, since he so desperately needs what only you can supply.\"\n \"But I might say the same for you, sir,\" Woodward answered. He inhaled deeply, let settle, and then exhaled. The smoke, as it rose, seemed to him to break apart, merge, and break apart again like the movement of a beautiful kaleidoscope. \"You are master of the healing arts.\"\n \"Would that I were!\" Shields gave a hollow laugh, then leaned forward to give a conspiratorial whisper: \"Most of the time, I don\u0027t know what the hell I\u0027m doing.\"\"Oh, you\u0027re joking!\"\n \"No.\" Shields drew again and the smoke spooled from his mouth. \"It\u0027s quite pitifully true.\"\n \"I think your honesty has lost its brindle. I mean . . .\" Woodward had to pause to collect the words. The lessening of the pressure in his head also seemed to have shaken the proper vocabulary from his brain. \"Your modesty has lost its bridle, I think.\"\n \"Being a physician here ... in this town, at this time ... is a depressing occupation, sir. I have occasion to stroll past the cemetery in visiting my patients. Sometimes I feel I should set up office amid the graves, as there would not be as much travel required.\" He held the hemp stick between his lips and pulled rather violently on it. The amount of smoke that poured from his mouth was copious. Behind his spectacles, his eyes had become reddened and sad. \"It\u0027s the swamp, of course. Human beings were not meant to live so near to such a miasma. It burdens the soul and weakens the spirit. add upon that dismal picture the continual rain and the presence of the witch, and I cannot for the life of me see how Bidwell\u0027s town can thrive. People are leaving here every day . . . one way or the other. No.\" He shook his head. \"Mark Fount Royal as doomed.\"\n \"If you really believe so, why don\u0027t you take your wife and leavei\"\"My wifei\"\n \"Yes.\" Woodward blinked heavily. His air passages were feeling so much clearer, but his mind seemed befogged. \"The woman who admitted me. Isn\u0027t she your wifei\"\n \"Oh, you mean Mrs. Heussen. My nurse. No, my wife and two sons - no, one son - live in Boston. My wife is a seamstress. I did have two sons. One of them ...\" He inhaled in a way that struck Woodward as being needful. \"... the eldest, was murdered by a highwayman on the Philadelphia Post Road. That would be . . . oh . .. eight years ago, I suppose, but still some wounds refuse the remedy of time. To have a child - no matter what age - snatched away from you in such a fashion ...\" He trailed off, watching the blue smoke swirl in currents and eddies as it rose toward the ceiling. \"Pardon me,\" he said presently, lifting a hand to rub his eyes. \"My mind wandered.\"\n \"If I may ask,\" Woodward ventured, \"why does your wife remain in Bostoni\"\n \"You\u0027re not suggesting that she come here to live, are youi Christ\u0027s Blood, I wouldn\u0027t hear of it! No, she\u0027s much better off in Boston, where the medical facilities are modern. They\u0027ve tamed their salt marshes and tidepools up there, as well, so the damp humours aren\u0027t so vengeful.\" He took a quick sip of the hemp and slowly spewed out the smoke. \"For the same reasons, Winston left his family in England and Bidwell wouldn\u0027t dream of having his wife make the voyage - not even on one of his own ships! You know, Johnstone\u0027s wife so detested the place that she returned to England and refused to make the crossing again. Do you blame heri This isn\u0027t a woman\u0027s land, that\u0027s a surety!\"\n Woodward, though this fog was rapidly overcoming his mind, remembered what he had intended to ask Dr. Shields. \"about Schoolmaster Johnstone,\" he said, his tongue thick and seemingly coated with cat fur. \"I have to inquire about this, and I know it must sound very strange, but . . . have you ever seen his deformed kneei\"\n \"His kneei No, I haven\u0027t. I\u0027m not sure I would care to, since deformation is not my area of interest. I have sold him bandages and liniment for his discomfort, though.\" Shields frowned. \"Why do you ask such a questioni\"\n \"My curiosity,\" he replied, though it was more Matthew\u0027s curiosity that his own. \"Uh . . . would it be unlikely that Mr. Johnstone could ... for instance . . . run or climb stairsi\"\n The doctor looked at Woodward as if the magistrate\u0027s senses had flown the coop.\"I take it that he could not,\" Woodward said.\n \"Most certainly not. Well, he might be able to climb stairs one at the time, but I think the effort would be considerable.\" He cocked his head to one side, his owlish eyes bright. \"What are these questions about, Isaaci May I call you Isaaci\"\"Yes, of course. and may I call you Benjamini\"\n \"absolutely. So: Isaac, my friend, why these questions pertaining to Johnstone\u0027s kneei\"\n \"a thief entered Mr. Bidwell\u0027s house early this morning,\" Woodward said, leaning his head forward. Smoke moved sinuously between himself and the doctor. \"Whoever it was, he stole a gold coin from my clerk\u0027s room - \"\n \"ah, yes.\" Shields nodded. \"The famous coin. I heard about it from Malcolm Jennings when he came to have a boil lanced.\"\n \"I encountered the thief in the hallway,\" Woodward continued. \"He was a big man, with the strength of a bull. I fought him as best I could, but as he had caught me from behind I was at the disadvantage.\" It seemed more true now in his recollection that this had occurred, and who was to say it had noti \"Everything happened so quickly,\" Woodward said. \"I didn\u0027t see his face. He knocked a lamp from my hand and fled down the staircase. Of course I know Mr. Johnstone\u0027s deformity is severe, but . . . my clerk wanted to learn whether you\u0027ve inspected his knee, and if he\u0027s capable of such an action.\"\n Shields laughed. \"Surely you\u0027re not serious! alan Johnstone a thief! I should say that in all of Fount Royal there\u0027s no one who\u0027d be less a thief! The man\u0027s from a wealthy family!\"\n \"I presumed so, since he did attend all Souls\u0027 College at Oxford, but one never knows.\"\n \"I\u0027ve personally seen his gold pocket watch, inscribed with his initials. He owns a gold ring with a ruby in it the size of a man\u0027s fingernail!\" Shields laughed again, rather giddily. \"a thief indeed! No, it wouldn\u0027t be possible for alan to run down a staircase. You\u0027ve seen how he depends on his cane.\"\n \"Yes, I have. But the theory that I believe my clerk is advancing - and understand, please, that he\u0027s young and his imagination roams unrestrained - is that Mr. Johnstone\u0027s knee appears to be malformed, but is in truth - his theory, now - as normal as yours or mine.\"\n Shields blinked, took a sip of smoke, blinked again, and then his face broke into a merry grin. \"Oh, you\u0027re wearing a jester\u0027s cap now, is that iti\"\n Woodward shrugged. \"My clerk is quite serious. Therefore I had to make the inquiry.\"\n The doctor\u0027s grin faltered. \"This is the most . . . unbalanced thing I\u0027ve ever heard! You can see the deformity of his knee through his stocking! He\u0027s been in Fount Royal for three years! Why in the world would it serve him to devise such a pretensei\"\n \"I have no idea. again, please understand that Matthew is a very intelligent young man, but that sometimes his mind is unfettered by common sense.\"\n \"I should say so!\" Shields smoked his remedy some more, and so did the magistrate. Woodward was feeling quite better now, most of the pain having left his throat and his breathing passages much clearer. The movement of the smoke entranced him, and the quality of the light entering the room was like gray silk. \"I will tell you something about alan that you might find of interest,\" Shields suddenly confided. \"about his wife, I mean.\" He pitched his voice a little lower. \"Her name was Margaret. She was . . . how shall I say this ... of a peculiar character.\"\"In what wayi\"\n \"a lovely woman, no doubt. But . . . her bell was somewhat cracked. I never witnessed any of her outbursts, but I heard from reliable sources that she was quite the hellion, with a penchant for throwing whatever came to hand. Winston witnessed it, one night at Bidwell\u0027s house. The woman flew into a rage and smashed a platter of chicken against the wall. and there was the other thing.\" Shields let his sentence hang while he puffed his hemp stick, which was beginning to burn down between his fingers. \"One moment.\" He got up, went to the workbench, and returned with the small stub of hemp clamped in the probe as the cotton had been. He sat down again, a mischievous shine in his eyes. \"Mrs. Johnstone and the husband of that poor woman in the infirmary ...\" He motioned with an angling of his head in the direction of the other room. \"They had a number of assignations.\"\"Noles and Johnstone\u0027s wifei\"\n \"Correct. and quite bold about it, as I recall. Many knew what was going on - including Noles\u0027s wife. In time someone told alan, but I think it came as no surprise to him. Well, Margaret despised Fount Royal anyway - she made no secret of that - and so alan took her back to England to live with her parents. She was of wealthy stock too - her father was in the textile business - but I believe she was a trifle overbred. a few months later, alan returned here and the matter was forgotten.\"\n \"adultery is a serious offense,\" Woodward said. \"Did he not wish to press chargesi\"\n \"I honestly think he was relieved to be rid of the woman. She was a menace to his reputation, and certainly lacking in decorum. alan is a quiet, thoughtful man who keeps to himself for the most part, but he does have a cutting wit.\"\n \"He must be a dedicated teacher, to have returned so soon to Fount Royal.\"\n \"That he is. He\u0027s taken it upon himself to educate not only the children here, but many of the farmers who can\u0027t read. and of course the salary Bidwell pays him is hardly enough to buy a needle and thread, but as I say the schoolmaster has money of his own.\"\n Woodward nodded, drawing once more on his hemp stick; it had burned quite well down, and he could feel its heat between his fingers. In fact, he felt very warm all over now, and was perspiring. This was a good thing, he thought. It must mean that he was sweating out the bad humours. His eyes felt heavy-lidded, and without much prompting he could lie down and take a nap. \"What about Winstoni\" he asked.\"What of himi\"\"I mean, what do you know about himi\"\n Shields grinned, smoke leaking between his teeth. \"am I on the witness stand, siri\"\n \"No, and I don\u0027t intend to sound like a magistrate. I\u0027d simply like to know more about the people here.\"\n \"I see,\" Shields said, though from his tone of voice it was clear he still believed court was in session. after a pause of deliberation, he said, \"Edward Winston is a loyal mule. You know that Winston was Bidwell\u0027s office manager in London, don\u0027t youi He\u0027s an excellent administrator, organizer, and bean counter. He, too, keeps quite to himself. I think in his case he\u0027s a bit uncomfortable around people. But it was his idea to bring the maskers here.\"\n \"The maskersi\"\n \"Yes. The actors, that is. Bidwell\u0027s fond of the theater. For the past three summers, a travelling company has come to enact a morality play. It does seem to bring some culture and civilization out here in the wilderness. at least, the citizens have something to look forward to every year. They come in mid-July, so it\u0027s a pity you won\u0027t be present to see them.\" Shields took one last puff and realized he had reached the end of his stick. \"Then again,\" he said, \"Fount Royal may not be here in mid-July, either.\"\n \"What of Nicholas Painei\" Woodward asked. \"Do you know him welli\"\n \"Nicholas Paine,\" the doctor repeated. He smiled slightly. \"Yes, I do know him well.\"\n \"He seems an able man.\" Woodward was thinking of that term Paine had used: black-flagger. \"What do you know of his historyi\"\"I know he has one. a history, I mean.\"\n \"I\u0027d call that a cryptic remark,\" Woodward said when Shields lapsed into silence.\n \"Nicholas is a very private man,\" Shields offered. \"He has been a jack-of-all-trades. Was a seaman for a number of years, I understand. But he\u0027s not open to discussing his past at much length.\"\"Is he marriedi Does he have a familyi\"\n \"He was married, when he was a younger man. His wife perished from an illness that caused her to suffer fits until she died.\"\n Woodward had lifted the small stub to his mouth for a final inhalation; now, however, his hand froze. \"Fitsi\" he said. He swallowed thickly. \"What kind of fitsi\"\n \"Convulsions, I suppose.\" The doctor shrugged. \"Some form of fever, most probably. Or the plague. But it was long ago, and I\u0027m sure Paine wouldn\u0027t care to speak about it. In fact, I know he would not.\"\n \"The plague,\" Woodward repeated. His eyes had become glazed, not entirely from the bitterly compelling smoke of his remedy.\n \"Isaaci\" Shields, noting the other man\u0027s vacant stare, touched the magistrate\u0027s sleeve. \"What is iti\"\n \"Oh, forgive me.\" Woodward blinked, waved some of the fumes away from his face, and brought himself back to his surroundings. \"I was thinking, that\u0027s all.\"\n Shields nodded, a sly smile twisting his mouth. \"Yes. Thinking of whom you might ask questions about me, is that correcti\"\"No. about something else entirely.\"\n \"But you are planning on inquiring about me, are you noti It would only be fair, since you\u0027ve pumped the well concerning the schoolmaster, Mr. Winston, and Mr. Paine. ah, I believe you\u0027re done with that! May Ii\" He took the burnt-down stub from Woodward\u0027s hand and placed it, along with the remnant of his own, into a small pewter jar, which he then closed with a hinged lid. \"are you feeling better nowi\"\"Yes. Remarkably so.\"\n \"Good. as I said, you might have to repeat the treatment according to your constitution. We shall see.\" Shields stood up. \"Now allow me to escort you to Van Gundy\u0027s tavern for a cup of his excellent hard cider. also he has a stock of peanuts on hand, as I\u0027m feeling quite hungry. Will you join mei\"\"I would be honored.\"\n When the magistrate stood from his chair, his legs almost betrayed him. His head was swimming and strange lights seemed to dance behind his eyes. But the pain in his throat had all but vanished, and his breathing was miraculously cleared. The doctor\u0027s remedy, he thought, was surely a wonder drug.\n \"Sometimes the smoke does play tricks with the balance,\" Shields said. \"Here, take my arm and a\u0027tavern we shall go!\"\n \"a tavern, a tavern!\" Woodward said. \"My kingdom for a tavern!\" This struck him as riotously funny, and he began to laugh at his own wit. The laughter was a little too loud and a little too harsh, however, and even in his lightened state of mind he knew what he was trying to cloak. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-13.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \n Judgment of the Witch \n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
