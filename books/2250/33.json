He felt tired and sluggish, yet frightened to the very core of his being. Matthew thought - and thinking seemed more of an effort than ever in his life - that Linch had done to his mind what he had done to Linch\u0027s dwelling: entered it without permission, poked about, and left a little smear of mud to betray his presence.\\n\\n Linch had without a doubt been the winner of their duel.\\n\\n But - also without a doubt - Matthew now knew Linch was the owner of the shadowy hand that could reach into the human mind and create whatever fiction it pleased. Matthew considered himself intelligent and alert; if he had been so affected by the ratcatcher\u0027s trancing ability, how simple a task it must have been to overwhelm the more rustic and less mentally agile Buckner, Garrick, and the other targets. and indeed Matthew suspected that the persons in whose minds Linch had planted the scenes of depravity had been carefully chosen because of their receptivity to such manipulation. Linch had obviously had a great deal of experience at this bizarre craft, and most surely he could recognize certain signals that indicated whether a person was a likely candidate for manipulation. Matthew thought that in his own case, Linch had been probing his line of mental defense and had been unsuccessful in breaking the barrier. Linch would probably have never even attempted such a thing if the man hadn\u0027t been desperate.\\n\\n Matthew offered his face to the sun, trying to burn out the last vestiges of shifting sand from the storehouse of memory.\\n\\n Linch, Matthew believed, had underestimated Violet adams. The child was more intelligent than her timidity let her appear. Matthew believed that the house in which she described seeing Satan and the white-haired imp was not the Hamilton house, but the house of her own mind. and back there in the dark room was the memory of Linch trancing her. Surely the man had not actually sung that song as he\u0027d done the work, but perhaps the recollection of the event had been locked away from her and so the song - which Violet had heard when Linch had come ratcatching at her house - was an alternate key.\\n\\n The question was: where and when had Violet been entrancedi Matthew thought that if Buckner and Garrick could remember correctly, they might supply the fact that Linch had also come ratcatching - or simply spreading poisoned bait as a \"precaution\" - to their own houses. Matthew could envision Linch asking either man to step out to the barn to look at evidence of rodent infestation, and then - once away from the sight of wives or other relatives - turning upon them the full power of this strange weapon that both erased reality and constructed a lifelike fiction. What was particularly amazing to Matthew was the fact that the effects of this power might be delayed some length of time; that is, Linch had given some mental command that the fiction not be immediately recollected, but instead recalled several nights later. and the memory of being entranced was erased from the mind altogether... except in the case of Violet adams, whose mind had begun to sing to her in Linch\u0027s voice.\\n\\n It was the damnedest thing he\u0027d ever heard of. Surely it was some form of sorcery! But it was real and it was here and it was the reason Rachel was going to be burned on Monday morning.\\n\\n and what could he do about iti\\n\\n Nothing, it seemed. Oh, he could go to Bidwell and plead his case, but he knew what the result of that would be. Bidwell might arrange shackles for him and put him in a cushioned room where he would be no danger to others or himself. Matthew would fear even mentioning such a theory to the magistrate; even if Woodward were able to hear and respond, he would believe Matthew to be so severely bewitched that the stress might sink him into his grave.\\n\\n The ratcatcher, it seemed, had done much more than winning a duel. Linch had demonstrated that the war was over and declared himself its absolute and cunning victor.\\n\\n Matthew drew his knees up to his chin and stared out over the blue water. He had to ask the question that seemed to him the most basic query in existence yet also the most complex: Whyi\\n\\n For what reason would Linch put forth such an effort to paint Rachel as a witchi and why, indeed, was a man of his vile nature even in Fount Royali Had he murdered Reverend Grove and Daniel Howarthi If Rachel was only a pawn in this strange game - if, for the sake of conjecture, Bidwell was the real target - then why go to such extremes to destroy Fount Royali Was it possible Linch had been sent from Charles Town to do these dark deedsi\\n\\n It seemed to Matthew that the jealous watchdogs in Charles Town might encourage the burning of a few empty houses, but they wouldn\u0027t stoop so low as to subsidize murder. Then again, who could say what reigned in a man\u0027s hearti It would not be the first time that gold coins were spent on a spill of crimson blood.\\n\\n Matthew narrowed his eyes slightly, watching the surface of the spring ripple with a passing breeze.\\n\\n Gold coins. Yes. Gold coins. Gold and silver, that is. Of the Spanish stamp.\\n\\n Taking shape in Matthew\u0027s mind was a theory worth chewing on.\\n\\n Say that, even though he\u0027d found nothing last night, there was indeed a fortune of pirate coins down at the bottom of the fount. Say that somehow Linch - whoever he really was - had learned of its presence, possibly months or even years before he\u0027d arrived on the scene. When Linch got here, he discovered a town surrounding the treasure vault. What, then, could he do to get the coins for himself and himself alonei\\n\\n The answer: he could create a witch and cause Fount Royal to wither and die.\\n\\n Perhaps Linch had gone swimming on more than one occasion, late at night, and discovered... Oh, Matthew thought, and the realization was like a punch... discovered not only gold and silver coins... but a sapphire brooch.\\n\\n What if there was not just coinage in that treasure vault, but also jewelryi Or loose gemstonesi If indeed Linch had brought that brooch up from the depths, then the ratcatcher was aware of how necessary it was to clear the town away before a real attempt at salvage could be undertaken.\\n\\n Yes, Matthew thought. Yes. It was definitely a reason to kill two men and create a witch. But wait... Was it not in Linch\u0027s best interest that Rachel not be burnedi With the removal of the \"witch, \" Fount Royal would likely start to grow healthy again. So what was he going to do to make sure the town\u0027s decline continuedi Create a second witchi That seemed to Matthew to be a task requiring a great deal of risk and months of planning. No, Rachel had been the perfect \"witch, \" and the more reasonable action would be to somehow capitalize on her death.\\n\\n Perhaps... with another murderi and who might find himself throat-slashed by the vengeance of \"Satan\" in a dimly lit room or hallway some evening hencei\\n\\n Matthew suspected that this time Linch would go for Fount Royal\u0027s jugular. Would it be Dr. Shields lying in a pool of bloodi Schoolmaster Johnstonei Edward Winstoni No. Those three men, though vital, were replaceable in the future of Fount Royal.\\n\\n The next victim would be Bidwell himself.\\n\\n Matthew stood up, his flesh in chillbumps. Near him a woman was dipping two buckets while conversing with a man who was filling a keg. Their faces, though lined by their lives of difficult labor, were free from concern; in them was the statement that all was right with Fount Royal... or soon to be right, with the execution of the witch.\\n\\n Little did they know, Matthew thought. Little did anyone know, except Linch. Especially little did Bidwell know, for as Rachel died writhing in the flames the plan would be set in motion to cut his throat in the same manner as the other victims.\\n\\n and what could be done about iti\\n\\n Matthew needed evidence. One sapphire brooch would not do; besides, Matthew was certain Linch would now hide it in a place even a rat couldn\u0027t discover. To expose the coins that Goode had found would be beneficial, but would also be a betrayal of Goode\u0027s trust. Obviously Linch was the thief who had entered Bidwell\u0027s house that night and taken the gold coin from Matthew\u0027s room, probably in an effort to ascertain if it was part of the treasure and where it might have come from. That was another question, however: how had an Indian gotten hold of a Spanish coini\\n\\n Matthew was feeling more like himself now. He wouldn\u0027t return to Linch\u0027s house alone for a barrel full of gold coins. But if he could find some piece of evidence that might implicate Linch... some hard proof to show Bidwell...\\n\\n \"There you are! I was just on my way to see you!\" That voice, high-pitched and waspish, struck him with fresh dread.\\n\\n He turned to face Lucretia Vaughan. She was smiling brightly, her hair contained under a stiff white bonnet, and she wore a lilac-colored dress. In her arms was a small basket. \"I hoped to find you in good spirits this day!\"\\n\\n \"Uh... yes. Good spirits.\" He was already edging away from her.\\n\\n \"Mr. Corbett, please allow me to present you with a gift! I know... well, I know our dinner last night was difficult for you, and I wished to - \"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right, \" Matthew said. \"No gift is necessary.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, but it is! I realized how much you enjoyed your food - in spite of my daughter\u0027s display of willful misbehavior - therefore I wished to bake you a pie. I trust you like sweet yamsi\" She lifted the golden-crusted pie from the basket to show him. It was held in a pie dish of white clay decorated with small red hearts.\\n\\n \"It... truly looks wonderful, \" Matthew told her. \"But I can\u0027t accept it.\"\\n\\n \"Nonsense! Of course you can! and you may return the dish the next time you come to dinner. Say... Tuesday evening at six o\u0027clocki\"\\n\\n He looked into her eyes and saw there a rather sad combination of voracity and fear. as gently as possible, he said, \"Mrs. Vaughan, I can\u0027t accept the pie. and I can\u0027t accept your invitation to dinner, either.\"\\n\\n She just stared at him, her mouth partway open and the pie dish still offered. \"It is not in my power to help your daughter, \" Matthew continued. \"She seems to have her own mind about things, just as you do, and there lies the collision. I regret you have a problem in your household, but I can\u0027t solve it for you.\"\\n\\n The woman\u0027s mouth had opened a little wider.\\n\\n \"again, thank you for the dinner. I truly did enjoy it, and the company. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse - \"\\n\\n \"You... ungrateful... young... bastard!\" she suddenly hissed, her cheeks flaming red and her eyes half-crazed with anger. \u0027\"Do you realize what effort was expended to please youi\"\\n\\n \"Uh... well... I\u0027m sorry, but - \"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sorry, \" she mimicked bitterly. \"Sorry! Do you know how much money and time I spent on Cherise\u0027s gowni Do you know how I worked over that hearth and cleaned that house for your pleasurei are you sorry about that, tooi\"\\n\\n Matthew noticed that several citizens who\u0027d come to the spring for water were watching. If Lucretia noticed, it made no difference to her because she kept firing cannonades at him. \"Oh, but you came in our house and ate your fill, didn\u0027t youi You sat there like a lord at feast! You even took bread away with you! and now you\u0027re sorry!\" Tears of rage - misguided rage, Matthew thought - wet her eyes. \"I thought you were a gentleman! Well, you\u0027re a right sorry gentleman, aren\u0027t youi\"\\n\\n \"Mrs. Vaughan, \" Matthew said firmly, \"I cannot save your daughter from what you perceive as - \"\\n\\n \"Who asked you to save anybody, you self-righteous prigi How dare you speak to me as if I\u0027m a milkmaid! I am a person of esteem in this town! Do you hear mei Esteem!\"\\n\\n She was shouting in his face. Matthew said quietly, \"Yes, I hear you.\"\\n\\n \"If I were a man you wouldn\u0027t speak to me with such disrespect! Well, damn you! Damn you and Charles Town and damn all you who think you\u0027re better than other people!\"\\n\\n \"Pardon me, \" he said, and began walking toward the mansion.\\n\\n \"Yes, go on and run!\" she hollered. \"Run back to Charles Town, where your kind belongs! You city dog!\" Something in her voice broke, but she forced it back. \"Playing in your ludicrous gardens and dancing at your sinful balls! Go on and run!\"\\n\\n Matthew didn\u0027t run, but his walking pace was brisk enough. He saw that the window of Bidwell\u0027s upstairs study had opened and there was the master himself, looking out upon this unfortunate scene. Bidwell was grinning, and when he realized Matthew had seen him he put his hand to his mouth to hide it.\\n\\n \"Wait, wait!\" the brazen woman shouted. \"Here, take your pie!\"\\n\\n Matthew looked back in time to see Lucretia Vaughan hurl the pie - dish and all - into the spring. Then she fired a glare at him that might have scorched iron, turned on her heel, and stalked away, her chin lifted high as if she had put the Charles Town draggletail in his fly-blown place.\\n\\n Matthew entered the mansion and went directly up the stairs to the magistrate\u0027s room. Woodward\u0027s shutters were closed, but Matthew thought the woman\u0027s enraged vocals must have frightened birds back in the swamp. The magistrate, however, still slept on, though he did shift his position to the side as Matthew stood next to his bed.\\n\\n \"Siri\" Matthew said, touching his shoulder. \"Siri\"\\n\\n Woodward\u0027s sleep-swollen eyes opened to slits. He struggled to focus. \"Matthewi\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Oh... I thought it was you. I had a dream. a crow... shrieking. Gone now.\"\\n\\n \"Can I get you anythingi\"\\n\\n \"No. Just... tired... very tired. Dr. Shields was here.\"\\n\\n \"He wasi This morningi\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Told me... it was Friday. My days and nights... they run together.\"\\n\\n \"I can imagine so. You\u0027ve been very ill.\"\\n\\n Woodward swallowed thickly. \"That potion... Dr. Shields gives me. It has... a very disagreeable taste. I told him I should... wish some sugar in it on the next drinking.\"\\n\\n Here was a reason for hope, Matthew thought. The magistrate was lucid and his senses were returning. \"I think the potion is doing you some good, sir.\"\\n\\n \"My throat still pains me.\" He put a hand to it. \"But I do feel ... somewhat lighter. Tell me... did I dream this, or... did Dr. Shields apply a funnel to my bottomi\"\\n\\n \"You had a colonic, \" Matthew said. He would long remember the aftermath of that particularly repugnant but necessary procedure. So too would the servant who had to wash out the two chamberpots filled with black, tar-like refusal.\\n\\n \"ah. Yes... that would explain it. My apologies... to all involved.\"\\n\\n \"No apologies are necessary, sir. You\u0027ve comported yourself with extreme grace for the... uh... unpleasantness of your situation.\" Matthew went to the dresser and got the bowl of fresh water that had been placed there and one of several clean cotton cloths.\\n\\n \"always... the diplomat, \" Woodward whispered. \"This potion... does tire me. Matthew... what was done... to my backi\"\\n\\n \"The doctor used blister cups.\" Matthew dipped the cloth into the water bowl.\\n\\n \"Blister cups, \" Woodward repeated. \"Oh. Yes... I do remember now. Quite painful.\" He managed a grim smile. \"I must have been... knocking at death\u0027s door.\"\\n\\n \"Not nearly so close as that.\" Matthew wrang out the wet cloth and then began to gently apply the cool cotton to Woodward\u0027s still-pallid face. \"Let us just say you were on a precarious street. But you\u0027re better now, and you\u0027re going to continue improving. Of that I\u0027m positive.\"\\n\\n \"I trust... you are right.\"\\n\\n \"I am not only right, I am correct, \" Matthew said. \"The worst part of your illness has been vanquished.\"\\n\\n \"Tell that... to my throat... and my aching bones. Oh, what a sin it is... to be old.\"\\n\\n \"Your age has nothing to do with your condition, sir.\" Matthew pressed the cloth to Woodward\u0027s forehead. \"You have youth in you yet.\"\\n\\n \"No... I have too much past behind me.\" He stared at nothing, his eyes slightly glazed in appearance, as Matthew continued to dampen his face. \"I would... give... so much... to be you, son.\" Matthew\u0027s hand may have been interrupted in its motions for only a few fleeting seconds.\\n\\n \"To be you, \" Woodward repeated. \"and where you are. With the world... ahead of you... and the luxury of time.\"\\n\\n \"You have much time ahead of you too, sir.\"\\n\\n \"My arrow... has been shot, \" he whispered. \"and... where it fell... I do not know. But you... you... are just now drawing back your bow.\" He released a long, strengthless sigh. \"My advice to you... is to aim at a worthy target.\"\\n\\n \"You will have much further opportunity to help me identify such a target, sir.\"\\n\\n Woodward laughed softly, though the act seemed to pain his throat because it ended in a grimace. \"I doubt... I can help you... with much anymore, Matthew. It has come... to my attention on this trip... that you have a very able mind of your own. You... are a man, now... with all that manhood entails. The bitter... and the sweet. You have made a good start... at manhood... by standing up for your convictions... even against me.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t begrudge my opinionsi\"\\n\\n \"I would feel... an utter failure... if you had none, \" he answered.\\n\\n \"Thank you, sir, \" Matthew said. He finished his application of the cloth and returned it to the water bowl, which he placed atop the dresser again.\\n\\n \"That is not to say, \" Woodward added, in as loud and clear a voice as he could summon, \"that... we are in agreement. I still say... the woman is your nightbird... intent on delivering you to the dark. But... every man hears a nightbird... of some form or fashion. It is the... struggle to overcome its call that either... creates or destroys a man\u0027s soul. You will understand what I mean. Later... after the witch is long silenced.\"\\n\\n Matthew stood beside the dresser, his head lowered. He said, \"Siri I need to tell you that - \" and then he stopped himself. What was the use of iti The magistrate would never understand. Never. He hardly understood it himself, and he\u0027d experienced Linch\u0027s power. No, putting these things into words might rob the magistrate of his improving health, and no good could come of it.\\n\\n \"Tell me whati\" Woodward asked.\\n\\n \"That Mr. Bidwell is hosting a dinner tonight, \" was the first thing that entered his mind. \"The maskers have arrived early, and evidently there\u0027s to be a reception to honor them. I... wanted to tell you, in case you heard voices raised in festivity and wished to know why.\"\\n\\n \"ah. This Satan-besieged town... could benefit... from voices raised in festivity.\" Woodward let his eyes close again. \"Oh ... I am so tired. Come visit me later... and we shall talk about ... our trip home. a journey... I sincerely look forward to.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. Sleep well.\" Matthew left the room.\\n\\n In his own bedchamber, Matthew settled down in the chair by the window to continue reading the book on English plays. It was not that he was compelled to do so by the subject matter, but because he wished to give his mind a rest from its constant maze-crawl. It was his belief, also, that one might see a large picture only by stepping back from the frame. He\u0027d been reading perhaps ten minutes when there came a knock at his door.\\n\\n \"Young siri\" It was Mrs. Nettles. \"I ha\u0027 somethin\u0027 sent from Mr. Bidwell.\"\\n\\n Matthew opened the door and found that the woman had brought a silver tray on which rested a single, beautifully blown glass goblet filled with amber liquid.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s thisi\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Bidwell asked that I open a verra old bottle of rum. He said ta tell you that you deserved a taste of such, after such a foul taste as ye had just recently.\" She looked at him questioningly. \"Bein\u0027 a servant, I did nae ask what he meant.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s being kind. Thank you.\" Matthew took the goblet and smelled its contents. From the heady aroma, the liquor promised to send him to the same peaceful Elysium that the magistrate currently inhabited. Though it was quite early for drinking so numbing a friend, Matthew decided to allow himself at least two good swallows.\\n\\n \"I ha\u0027 another direction from Mr. Bidwell, \" Mrs. Nettles said. \"He asks that you take dinner in your room, the kitchen, or at Van Gundy\u0027s this eve. He asks me to inform you that your bill at Van Gundy\u0027s would be his pleasure.\"\\n\\n Matthew realized it was Bidwell\u0027s way of telling him he was not invited to the maskers\u0027 dinner. Bidwell had no more use for the services of either the magistrate or Matthew, thus out of sight and out of mind. Matthew also suspected that Bidwell was a little wary of allowing him to roam loose at a gathering. \"I\u0027ll eat at the tavern, \" he said.\\n\\n \"Yes sir. May I get you any thin\u0027 elsei\"\\n\\n \"No.\" as soon as he said it, he reversed his course. \"Uh... yes.\" The unthinkable thing had entered his mind once more, as if bound to determine how strong was his fortress wall between common sense and insanity. \"Would you come in for a moment, pleasei\" She entered and he shut the door.\\n\\n He drank his first swallow of the rum, which lit a conflagration down his throat. Then he walked to the window and stood looking over the slave quarters in the direction of the tidewater swamp.\\n\\n \"I ha\u0027 things ta tend, \" Mrs. Nettles said.\\n\\n \"Yes. Forgive me for drifting, but... what I need to ask you is...\" He paused again, knowing that in the next few seconds he would be walking a thin and highly dangerous rope. \"First of all, \" he decided to say, \"I passed by the field this morning. Where the execution will take place. I saw the stake... the firemound... everything in preparation.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, \" she answered, with no emotion whatsoever.\\n\\n \"I know that Rachel Howarth is innocent.\" Matthew looked directly into Mrs. Nettles\u0027s dark, flesh-hooded eyes. \"Do you hear mei I know it. I also know who is responsible for the two murders and Rachel\u0027s predicament... but I am absolutely unable to prove any of it.\"\\n\\n \"are you free to name this personi\"\\n\\n \"No. and please understand that my decision is not because I don\u0027t trust you, but because telling you would only compound your agony in this situation, as it has mine. also, there are... circumstances I don\u0027t fathom, therefore it\u0027s best to speak no names.\"\\n\\n \"as you wish, sir, \" she said, but it was spoken with a broad hint of aggravation.\\n\\n \"Rachel will burn on Monday morning. There is no doubt about that. Unless some extraordinary event occurs between now and then to overturn the magistrate\u0027s decree, or some revealing proof comes to light. You may be assured I will continue to shake the bushes for such proof.\"\\n\\n \"That is all well and good, sir, but what does this ha\u0027 to do with mei\"\\n\\n \"For you I have a question, \" he said. He took his second swallow of rum, and then waited for his eyes to cease watering. Now he had come to the end of the rope, and beyond it lay... whati\\n\\n He took a deep breath and exhaled it. \"Do you know anything of the Florida countryi\"\\n\\n Mrs. Nettles gave no visible reaction. \"The Florida country, \" she repeated.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. You may be aware that it\u0027s Spanish territoryi Perhaps two hundred miles from - \"\\n\\n \"I do know your meanin\u0027. and yes, for sure I know them Spaniards are down there. I keep up with my currents.\"\\n\\n Matthew gazed out the window again, toward the swamp and the sea. \"Do you also then know, or have you heard, that the Spanish offer sanctuary to escaped English criminals and English-owned slavesi\"\\n\\n Mrs. Nettles was a moment in replying. \"Yes sir, I\u0027ve heard. From Mr. Bidwell, talkin\u0027 at table one eve with Mr. Winston and Mr. Johnstone. a young slave by the name of Morganthus Crispin took flight last year. He and his woman. Mr. Bidwell believed they was goin\u0027 to the Florida country.\"\\n\\n \"Did Mr. Bidwell try to recapture the slavesi\"\\n\\n \"He did. Solomon Stiles and two or three others went.\"\\n\\n \"Were they successfuli\"\\n\\n \"Successful, \" she said, \"in findin\u0027 the corpses. What was left of \u0027em. Mr. Bidwell told John Goode somethin\u0027 had et \u0027em, jus\u0027 tore \u0027em up terrible. Likely a burr, is what he said.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Bidwell told this to John Goodei\" Matthew lifted his eyebrows. \"Whyi To discourage any of the other slaves from runningi\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, I \u0027spect so.\"\\n\\n \"Were the corpses brought backi Did you see themi\"\\n\\n \"No sir, neither one. They left \u0027em out there, since there wasn\u0027t a value to \u0027em na\u0027 more.\"\\n\\n \"a value.\" Matthew said, and grunted. \"But tell me this, then: was it possible that the slaves were indeed not killedi Was it possible they were never found, and Bidwell had to invent such a storyi\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know, sir. Of that Mr. Bidwell would nae confide in me.\"\\n\\n Matthew nodded. He took a third drink. \"Rachel is going to die for crimes she did not commit, because she fits someone\u0027s twisted need. and I can\u0027t save her. as much as I wish to... as much as I know she is innocent... I can\u0027t.\" Before he could think about it, a fourth swallow of rum had burned down his hatch. \"Do you remember saying to me that she needed a championi\"\\n\\n \"I do.\"\\n\\n \"Well... she needs one now more than ever. Tell me this: have any other slaves but Crispin and his wife fled southi Have any tried to reach the Florida country, been caught and returnedi\"\\n\\n Her mouth slowly opened. \"My Lord, \" she said softly. \"You... want to know what the land\u0027s like \u0027tween here and there, don\u0027t yei\"\\n\\n \"I said nothing about that. I simply asked if any other - \"\\n\\n \"What you asked and what you meant, \" Mrs. Nettles said, \"are two different horses. I\u0027m gettin\u0027 your drift, sir, and I can\u0027t believe what I\u0027m hearin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly what are you hearing, theni\"\\n\\n \"You know That you\u0027d be willin\u0027 ta take her out of that gaol and down ta th\u0027 Florida country.\"\\n\\n \"I said nothing of the sort! and please keep your voice lowered!\"\\n\\n \"Did you have to speak iti\" she asked pointedly. \"all these questions, like ta run out my ears!\" She advanced a step toward him, looking in her severe black dress like a dark-painted wall in motion. \"Listen to me, young man, and I trust ye listen well. For your further warrant, it is my understandin\u0027 that the Florida country lies near a hundred and fifty miles from Fount Royal, nae two hundred... but you would nae make five miles a\u0027fore you \u0027n Madam Howarth both were either et by wild animals or scalped by wild Indians!\"\\n\\n \"You forget that the magistrate and I arrived here on foot. We walked considerably more than five miles, through mud and in a pouring rain.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, \" she said, \"and look at the magistrate now. Laid low, he is, \u0027cause of that walk. If you don\u0027t believe that had somethin\u0027 to do with at least wearin\u0027 him out, you\u0027re sadly mistook!\" Matthew might have become angered, but Mrs. Nettles was only voicing what he already knew to be true.\\n\\n \"The likes of this I\u0027ve never heard!\" She crossed her arms over her massive bosom in a scolding posture, the silver tray gripped in her right hand. \"This is a damn dangerous land! I\u0027ve seen grown men - men with a mite more meat on their bones than you - chopped ta their knees by it! What would you do, theni Jus\u0027 parade her from the gaol, mount y\u0027selves two horses and ride out th\u0027 gatei Ohhhhh, I think nae!\"\\n\\n Matthew finished the glass of rum and hardly felt the fire. \"and even if ye did fetch her out, \" the woman continued, \"and did by some God-awe miracle get her down ta th\u0027 Florida country, what theni You think it\u0027s a matter of givin\u0027 her over ta th\u0027 Spanish and then comin\u0027 backi No, again you\u0027re sadly mistook! There would be no comin\u0027 back. Ever. You\u0027d be livin\u0027 the rest of your life out with them conquista-... them con-... them squid-eaters!\"\\n\\n \"So long as they wouldn\u0027t mix it with blood sausage, \" Matthew muttered.\\n\\n \"Whati\"\\n\\n \"Nothing. Just... thinking aloud.\" He licked the goblet\u0027s rim and then held the glass out. Mrs. Nettles reverted to the role of servant and put the silver tray up to receive the empty goblet.\\n\\n \"Thank you for the information and the candor, \" Matthew said. Instead of luffing his sails, the rum had stolen his wind. He felt light-headed but heavy at heart. He went to the window and stood beside it with his hand braced against the wall and his head drooping.\\n\\n \"Yes sir. Is there anythin\u0027 elsei\" She walked to the door, where she paused before leaving.\\n\\n \"One thing, \" Matthew said. \"If someone had taken your sister to the Florida country, after she was accused and convicted of witchcraft, she would still be alive today. Wouldn\u0027t you have wanted thati\"\\n\\n \"Of course, sir. But I wouldn\u0027t ask a body to give up his life ta do it.\"\\n\\n \"Mrs. Nettles, my life will be given up when Rachel is burned on that stake Monday morning. Knowing what I do... and unable to save her through the proper legal channels... it\u0027s going to be more than I can bear. and I fear also that this is a burden that will never disappear, but only grow heavier with the passage of time.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s the case, I regret ever askin\u0027 you ta take an interest in her.\"\\n\\n \"It is the case, \" he replied, with some heat in it. \"and you did ask me to take an interest, and I have... and here we are.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, my, \" Mrs. Nettles said quietly, her eyes widening.\\n\\n \"Oh..... my.\"\\n\\n \"Is there a meaning behind thati If so, I\u0027d like to hear it.\"\\n\\n \"You... have a feelin\u0027 for her, do you naei\"\\n\\n \"a feelingi Yes, I care whether she lives or dies!\"\\n\\n \"Nae only that, \" Mrs. Nettles said. \"You know of what I\u0027m speakin\u0027. Oh, my. Who\u0027d ha\u0027 thought such a thingi\"\\n\\n \"You may go now.\" He turned his back to her, directing his attention out the window at some passing figment.\\n\\n \"Does she knowi She ought ta. It mi\u0027 ease her - \"\\n\\n \"Please go, \" he said, through clenched teeth.\\n\\n \"Yes sir, \" she answered, rather meekly, and she closed the door behind her.\\n\\n Matthew eased himself down in the chair again and put his hands to his face. What had he ever done to deserve such torment as thisi Of course it was nothing compared to the anguish Rachel would be subjected to in less than seventy-two hours.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t bear it. He couldn\u0027t. For he knew that wherever he ran on Monday morning... wherever he hid... he would hear Rachel\u0027s screams and smell her flesh burning.\\n\\n He was near drunk from the goblet of fiery rum, but in truth he could have easily swallowed down the bottle. He had come to the end of the road. There was nothing more he could do, say, or discover. Linch had won. When Bidwell was found murdered a week or so hence - after Matthew and the magistrate had left, of course - the tales of Satan\u0027s vengeance would spread through Fount Royal and in one month, if that long, the town would be deserted. Linch might even move into the mansion and lord over an estate of ghosts while he plundered the fount.\\n\\n Matthew\u0027s mind was beleaguered. The room\u0027s walls had begun to slowly spin, and if he hadn\u0027t put down the Sir Richard he might have feared Linch was still trampling through his head.\\n\\n There were details... details that did not fit.\\n\\n The surveyor, for instance. Who had he beeni Perhaps just a surveyor, after alli The gold coin possessed by Shawcombe. From where had the Indian gotten iti The disappearance of Shawcombe and that nasty brood. Where had they gone, leaving their valuables behindi\\n\\n and the murder of Reverend Grove.\\n\\n He could understand why Linch had killed Daniel Howarth. But why the reverendi To emphasize that the Devil had no use for a man of Godi To remove what the citizens would feel was a source of protection from evili Or was it another reason altogether, something that Matthew was missingi\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t think anymore. The walls were spinning too fast. He was going to have to stand up and try to reach the bed, if he could. Ready... one... two... three!\\n\\n He staggered to the bed, barely reaching it before the room\u0027s rotation lamed him. Then he lay down on his back, his arms out-flung on either side, and with a heaving sigh he gave himself up from this world of tribulations. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-33.html","bookId":2250,"book":{"id":2250,"title":"Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1)","description":"Storyline: Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett #1) \\n Judgment of the Witch \\n The Carolinas, 1699: The citizens of Fount Royal believe a witch has cursed their town with inexplicable tragedies  and they demand that beautiful widow Rachel Howarth be tried and executed for witchcraft.
