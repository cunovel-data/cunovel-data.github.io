{"id":14382,"no":29,"title":"XXVII. WHY MR. POSSUM HAS NO HAIR ON HIS TAIL","content":"\"HIT look like ter me,\" said Uncle Remus, frowning, as the little boy came hopping and skipping into the old man\u0027s cabin, \"dat I see a young un \u0027bout yo\u0027 size playin\u0027 en makin\u0027 free wid dem ar chilluns er ole Miss Favers\u0027s yistiddy, en w\u0027en I seed dat, I drap my axe, en I come in yer en sot flat down right whar you er settin\u0027 now, en I say ter myse\u0027f dat it\u0027s \u0027bout time fer ole Remus fer ter hang up en quit. Dat\u0027s des zackly w\u0027at I say.\" \"Well, Uncle Remus, they called me,\" said the little boy, in a penitent tone. \u0027They come and called me, and said they had a pistol and some powder over there.\" \"Dar now!\" exclaimed the old man, indignantly. \"Dar now! w\u0027at I bin sayin\u0027? Hit\u0027s des a born blessin\u0027 dat you wa\u0027n\u0027t brung home on a litter wid bofe eyeballs hangin\u0027 out en one year clean gone; dat\u0027s w\u0027at \u0027tis. Hit\u0027s des a born blessin\u0027. Hit hope me up might\u0027ly de udder day w\u0027en I hear Miss Sally layin\u0027 down de law \u0027bout you en dem Favers chillun, yit, lo en behol\u0027s, de fus news I knows yer you is han\u0027-in-glove wid um. Hit\u0027s nuff fer ter fetch ole Miss right up out\u0027n dat berryin\u0027-groun\u0027 fum down dar in Putmon County, en w\u0027at yo\u0027 gran\u0027ma wouldn\u0027t er stood me en yo\u0027 ma ain\u0027t gwineter stan\u0027 nudder, en de nex time I hear \u0027bout sech a come off ez dis, right den en dar I\u0027m boun\u0027 ter lay de case \u0027fo\u0027 Miss Sally.

He was a very wise little boy, and he knew that, in Uncle Remus\u0027s eyes, he had been guilty of a flagrant violation of the family code. Therefore, instead of attempting to justify himself, he pleaded guilty, and promised that he would never do so any more. After this there was a long period of silence, broken only by the vigorous style in which Uncle Remus puffed away at his pipe. This was the invariable result. Whenever the old man had occasion to reprimand the little boy—and the occasions were frequent—he would relapse into a dignified but stubborn silence. Presently the youngster drew forth from his pocket a long piece of candle. The sharp eyes of the old man saw it at once. \"Don\u0027t you come a tellin\u0027 me dat Miss Sally gun you dat,\" he exclaimed, \"kaze she didn\u0027t. En I lay you hatter be monstus sly \u0027fo\u0027 you gotter chance fer ter snatch up dat piece er cannle.\" \"Well, Uncle Remus,\" the little boy explained, \"it was lying there all by itself, and I just thought I\u0027d fetch it out to you. \"Dat\u0027s so, honey,\" said Uncle Remus, greatly mollified; \"dat\u0027s so, kaze by now some er dem yuther niggers \u0027ud er done had her lit up. Dey er mighty biggity, dem house niggers is, but I notices dat dey don\u0027t let nuthin\u0027 pass. Dey goes \u0027long wid der han\u0027s en der mouf open, en w\u0027at one don\u0027t ketch de tother one do.\" There was another pause, and finally the little boy said: \"Uncle Remus, you know you promised to-day to tell me why the \u0027Possum has no hair on his tail.\" \"Law, honey! ain\u0027t you done gone en fergot dat off\u0027n yo\u0027 mine yit? Hit look like ter me,\" continued the old man, leisurely refilling his pipe, \"dat she sorter run like dis: One time ole Brer Possum, he git so hungry, he did, dat he bleedzd fer ter have a mess er \u0027simmons. He monstus lazy man, old Brer Possum wuz, but bimeby his stummick \u0027gun ter growl en holler at \u0027im so dat he des hatter rack \u0027roun\u0027 en hunt up sump\u0027n; en w\u0027iles he wuz rackin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027, who sh\u0027d he run up wid but Brer Rabbit, en dey wuz hail-fellers, kaze Brer Possum, he ain\u0027t bin bodder\u0027n Brer Rabbit like dem yuther creeturs.

Den Brer Possum, he say whar, en Brer Rabbit, he say w\u0027ich \u0027twuz over at Brer B\u0027ar\u0027s \u0027simmon orchard.\" \"Did the Bear have a \u0027simmon orchard, Uncle Remus?\" the little boy asked. \"Co\u0027se, honey, kaze in dem days Brer B\u0027ar wuz a bee-hunter. He make his livin\u0027 findin\u0027 bee trees, en de way he fine um he plant \u0027im some \u0027simmon-trees, w\u0027ich de bees dey\u0027d come ter suck de \u0027simmons en den ole Brer B\u0027ar he\u0027d watch um whar dey\u0027d go, en den he\u0027d be mighty ap\u0027 fer ter come up wid um.
