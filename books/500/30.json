{"id":14383,"no":30,"title":"XXVIII. THE END OF MR. BEAR","content":"THE next time the little boy sought Uncle Remus out, he found the old man unusually cheerful and good-humoured. His rheumatism had ceased to trouble him, and he was even disposed to be boisterous. He was singing when the little boy got near the cabin, and the child paused on the outside to listen to the vigorous but mellow voice of the old man, as it rose and fell with the burden of the curiously plaintive song—a senseless affair so far as the words were concerned, but sung to a melody almost thrilling in its sweetness: \"Han\u0027 me down my walkin\u0027-cane (Hey my Lily! go down de road!), Yo\u0027 true lover gone down de lane (Hey my Lily! go down de road!).\" The quick ear of Uncle Remus, however, had detected the presence of the little boy, and he allowed his song to run into a recitation of nonsense, of which the following, if it be rapidly spoken, will give a faint idea: \"Ole M\u0027er Jackson, fines\u0027 confraction, fell down sta\u0027rs fer to git satisfaction; big Bill Fray, he rule de day, eve\u0027ything he call fer come one, two by three. Gwine \u0027long one day, met Johnny Huby, ax him grine nine yards er steel fer me, tole me w\u0027ich he couldn\u0027t; den I hist \u0027im over Hickerson Dickerson\u0027s barn-doors; knock \u0027im ninety-nine miles under water, w\u0027en he rise, he rise in Pike straddle un a hanspike, en I lef\u0027 \u0027im dar smokin\u0027 er de hornpipe, Juba reda seda breda. Aunt Kate at de gate; I want to eat, she fry de meat en gimme skin, w\u0027ich I fling it back agin. Juba!\" All this, rattled off at a rapid rate and with apparent seriousness, was calculated to puzzle the little boy, and he slipped into his accustomed seat with an expression of awed bewilderment upon his face. \"Hit\u0027s all des dat away, honey,\" continued the old man, with the air of one who had just given an important piece of information. \"En w\u0027en you bin cas\u0027n shadders long ez de ole nigger, den you\u0027ll fine out who\u0027s w\u0027ich, en w\u0027ich\u0027s who.\" The little boy made no response. He was in thorough sympathy with all the whims and humors of the old man, and his capacity for enjoying them was large enough to include even those he could not understand. Uncle Remus was finishing an axe-handle, and upon these occasions it was his custom to allow the child to hold one end while he applied sand-paper to the other. These relations were pretty soon established, to the mutual satisfaction of the parties most interested, and the old man continued his remarks, but this time not at random: \"W\u0027en I see deze yer swell-head folks like dat \u0027oman w\u0027at come en tell yo\u0027 ma \u0027bout you chunkin\u0027 at her chilluns, w\u0027ich yo\u0027 ma make Mars John strop you, hit make my mine run back to ole Brer B\u0027ar. Ole Brer B\u0027ar, he got de swell-headedness hisse\u0027f, en ef der wuz enny swinkin\u0027, hit swunk too late fer ter he\u0027p ole Brer B\u0027ar. Leas\u0027ways dat\u0027s w\u0027at dey tells me, en I ain\u0027t never yearn it \u0027sputed.\" \"Was the Bear\u0027s head sure enough swelled, Uncle Remus?\" \"Now you talkin\u0027, honey!\" exclaimed the old man. \"Goodness! what made it swell?\" This was Uncle Remus\u0027s cue. Applying the sand-paper to the axe-helve with gentle vigor, he began. \"One time when Brer Rabbit wuz gwine lopin\u0027 home fum a frolic w\u0027at dey bin havin\u0027 up at Miss Meadows\u0027s, who should he happin up wid but ole Brer B\u0027ar. Co\u0027se, atter w\u0027at done pass \u0027twix um dey wa\u0027n\u0027t no good feelin\u0027s \u0027tween Brer Rabbit en ole Brer B\u0027ar, but Brer Rabbit, he wanter save his manners, en so he holler out: \"\u0027Heyo, Brer B\u0027ar! how you come on? I ain\u0027t seed you in a coon\u0027s age. How all down at yo\u0027 house? How Miss Brune en Miss Brindle?\" \"Who was that, Uncle Remus?\" the little boy interrupted. \"Miss Brune en Miss Brindle? Miss Brune wuz Brer B\u0027ar\u0027s ole \u0027oman, en Miss Brindle wuz his gal. Dat w\u0027at dey call um in dem days.
