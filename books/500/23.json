{"id":14376,"no":23,"title":"XXI. MR. RABBIT MEETS HIS MATCH AGAIN","content":"\"DERE wuz nudder man dat sorter play it sharp on Brer Rabbit,\" said Uncle Remus, as, by some mysterious process, he twisted a hog\u0027s bristle into the end of a piece of thread—an operation which the little boy watched with great interest. \"In dem days,\" continued the old man, \"de creeturs kyar\u0027d on marters same ez fokes. Dey went inter fahmin\u0027, en I speck ef de troof wuz ter come out, dey kep\u0027 sto\u0027, en had der camp-meetin\u0027 times en der bobbycues w\u0027en de wedder wuz \u0027greeble.\" Uncle Remus evidently thought that the little boy wouldn\u0027t like to hear of any further discomfiture of Brer Rabbit, who had come to be a sort of hero, and he was not mistaken. \"I thought the Terrapin was the only one that fooled the Rabbit,\" said the little boy, dismally. \"Hit\u0027s des like I tell you, honey. Dey ain\u0027t no smart man, \u0027cep\u0027 w\u0027at dey\u0027s a smarter.

Dey did dat.\" \"Who fooled the Rabbit this time?\" the little boy asked. When Uncle Remus had the bristle \"sot\" in the thread, he proceeded with the story: \"One time Brer Rabbit en ole Brer Buzzard \u0027cluded dey\u0027d sorter go shares, en crap tergedder. Hit wuz a mighty good year, en de truck tu\u0027n out monstus well, but bimeby, w\u0027en de time come fer dividjun, hit come ter light dat ole Brer Buzzard ain\u0027t got nuthin\u0027. De crap wuz all gone, en dey want nuthin\u0027 dar fer ter show fer it. Brer Rabbit, he make like he in a wuss fix\u0027n Brer Buzzard, en he mope \u0027roun\u0027, he did, like he fear\u0027d dey gwineter sell \u0027im out. \"Brer Buzzard, he ain\u0027t sayin\u0027 nuthin\u0027, but he keep up a monstus thinkin\u0027, en one day he come \u0027long en holler en tell Brer Rabbit dat he done fine rich gol\u0027-mine des \u0027cross de river. \"\u0027You come en go longer me, Brer Rabbit,\u0027 sez Brer Tukkey Buzzard, sezee. \u0027Ill scratch en you kin grabble, en \u0027tween de two un us we\u0027ll make short wuk er dat gol\u0027-mine,\u0027 sezee. \"Brer Rabbit, he wuz high up fer de job, but he study en study, he did, how he gwineter git \u0027cross de water, kaze ev\u0027y time he git his foot wet all de fambly kotch col\u0027.
