{"id":14380,"no":27,"title":"XXV. HOW MR. RABBIT LOST HIS FINE BUSHY TAIL","content":"\"ONE time,\" said Uncle Remus, sighing heavily and settling himself back in his seat with an air of melancholy resignation— \"one time Brer Rabbit wuz gwine \u0027long down de road shakin\u0027 his big bushy tail, en feelin\u0027 des ez scrumpshus ez a bee-martin wid a fresh bug.\" Here the old man paused and glanced at the little boy, but it was evident that the youngster had become so accustomed to the marvelous developments of Uncle Remus\u0027s stories, that the extraordinary statement made no unusual impression upon him. Therefore the old man began again, and this time in a louder and more insinuating tone: \"One time ole man Rabbit, he wuz gwine \u0027long down de road shakin\u0027 his long, bushy tail, en feelin\u0027 mighty biggity.\" This was effective. \"Great goodness, Uncle Remus!\" exclaimed the little boy in open-eyed wonder, \"everybody knows that rabbits haven\u0027t got long, bushy tails.\" The old man shifted his position in his chair and allowed his venerable head to drop forward until his whole appearance was suggestive of the deepest dejection; and this was intensified by a groan that seemed to be the result of great mental agony. Finally he spoke, but not as addressing himself to the little boy. \"I notices dat dem fokes w\u0027at makes a great \u0027miration \u0027bout w\u0027at dey knows is des de fokes w\u0027ich you can\u0027t put no \u0027pennunce in w\u0027en de \u0027cashun come up. Yer one un um now, en he done come en excuse me er \u0027lowin dat rabbits is got long, bushy tails, w\u0027ich goodness knows ef I\u0027d a dremp\u0027 it, I\u0027d a whirl in en on-dremp it.\" \"Well, but Uncle Remus, you said rabbits had long, bushy tails,\" replied the little boy. \"Now you know you did.\" \"Ef I ain\u0027t fergit it off\u0027n my mine, I say dat ole Brer Rabbit wuz gwine down de big road shakin\u0027 his long, bushy tail. Dat w\u0027at I say, en dat I stan\u0027s by.\" The little boy looked puzzled, but he didn\u0027t say anything. After a while the old man continued: \"Now, den, ef dat\u0027s \u0027greed ter, I\u0027m gwine on, en ef tain\u0027t \u0027greed ter, den I\u0027m gwineter pick up my cane en look atter my own intrust. I got wuk lyin\u0027\u0027roun\u0027 yer dat\u0027s des natchully gittin\u0027 moldy.\" The little boy still remained quiet, and Uncle Remus proceeded: \"One day Brer Rabbit wuz gwine down de road shakin\u0027 his long, bushy tail, w\u0027en who should he strike up wid but ole Brer Fox gwine amblin\u0027 long wid a big string er fish! W\u0027en dey pass de time er day wid wunner nudder, Brer Rabbit, he open up de confab, he did, en he ax Brer Fox whar he git dat nice string er fish, en Brer Fox, he up\u0027n \u0027spon\u0027 dat he kotch um, en Brer Rabbit, he say whar\u0027bouts, en Brer Fox, he say down at de babtizin\u0027 creek, en Brer Rabbit he ax how, kaze in dem days dey wuz monstus fon\u0027 er minners, en Brer Fox, he sot down on a log, he did, en he up\u0027n tell Brer Rabbit dat all he gotter do fer ter git er big mess er minners is ter go ter de creek atter sundown, en drap his tail in de water en set dar twel day-light, en den draw up a whole armful er fishes, en dem w\u0027at he don\u0027t want, he kin fling back. \"Right dar\u0027s whar Brer Rabbit drap his watermillion, kaze he tuck\u0027n sot out dat night en went a fishin\u0027. De wedder wuz sorter col\u0027, en Brer Rabbit, he got \u0027im a bottle er dram en put out fer de creek, en w\u0027en he git dar he pick out a good place, en he sorter squot down, he did, en let his tail hang in de water.

He make a pull, en he feel like he comin\u0027 in two, en he fetch nudder jerk, en lo en beholes, whar wuz his tail?\" There was a long pause. \"Did it come off, Uncle Remus?\" asked the little boy, presently. \"She did dat!\" replied the old man with unction. \"She did dat, and dat w\u0027at make all deze yer bob-tail rabbits w\u0027at you see hoppin\u0027 en skaddlin\u0027 thoo de woods.\" \"Are they all that way just because the old Rabbit lost his tail in the creek?\" asked the little boy. \"Dat\u0027s it, honey,\" replied the old man. \"Dat\u0027s w\u0027at dey tells me.
