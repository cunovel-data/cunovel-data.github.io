{"id":14392,"no":39,"title":"A STORY OF THE WAR","content":"WHEN Miss Theodosia Huntingdon, of Burlington, Vermont, concluded to come South in 1870, she was moved by three considerations. In the first place, her brother, John Huntingdon, had become a citizen of Georgia—having astonished his acquaintances by marrying a young lady, the male members of whose family had achieved considerable distinction in the Confederate army; in the second place, she was anxious to explore a region which she almost unconsciously pictured to herself as remote and semi- barbarous; and, in the third place, her friends had persuaded her that to some extent she was an invalid. It was in vain that she argued with herself as to the propriety of undertaking the journey alone and unprotected, and she finally put an end to inward and outward doubts by informing herself and her friends, including John Huntingdon, her brother, who was practicing law in Atlanta, that she had decided to visit the South. When, therefore, on the 12th of October, 1870—the date is duly recorded in one of Miss Theodosia\u0027s letters—she alighted from the cars in Atlanta, in the midst of a great crowd, she fully expected to find her brother waiting to receive her. The bells of several locomotives were ringing, a number of trains were moving in and out, and the porters and baggage-men were screaming and bawling to such an extent that for several moments Miss Huntingdon was considerably confused; so much so that she paused in the hope that her brother would suddenly appear and rescue her from the smoke, and dust, and din. At that moment some one touched her on the arm, and she heard a strong, half-confident, half-apologetic voice exclaim: \"Ain\u0027t dish yer Miss Doshy?\" Turning, Miss Theodosia saw at her side a tall, gray-haired negro. Elaborating the incident afterward to her friends, she was pleased to say that the appearance of the old man was somewhat picturesque. He stood towering above her, his hat in one hand, a carriage-whip in the other, and an expectant smile lighting up his rugged face. She remembered a name her brother had often used in his letters, and, with a woman\u0027s tact, she held out her hand, and said: \"Is this Uncle Remus?\" \"Law, Miss Doshy! how you know de ole nigger? I know\u0027d you by de faver; but how you know me?\" And then, without waiting for a reply: \"Miss Sally, she sick in bed, en Mars John, he bleedzd ter go in de country, en dey tuck\u0027n sont me. I know\u0027d you de minnit I laid eyes on you. Time I seed you, I say ter myse\u0027f, \u0027I lay dar\u0027s Miss Doshy,\u0027 en, sho nuff, dar you wuz. You ain\u0027t gun up yo\u0027 checks, is you? Kaze I\u0027ll git de trunk sont up by de \u0027spress waggin.\" The next moment Uncle Remus was elbowing his way unceremoniously through the crowd, and in a very short time, seated in the carriage driven by the old man, Miss Huntingdon was whirling through the streets of Atlanta in the direction of her brother\u0027s home. She took advantage of the opportunity to study the old negro\u0027s face closely, her natural curiosity considerably sharpened by a knowledge of the fact that Uncle Remus had played an important part in her brother\u0027s history. The result of her observation must have been satisfactory, for presently she laughed, and said: \"Uncle Remus, you haven\u0027t told me how you knew me in that great crowd.\" The old man chuckled, and gave the horses a gentle rap with the whip. \"Who? Me! I know\u0027d you by de faver. Dat boy er Mars John\u0027s is de ve\u0027y spit en immij un you. I\u0027d a know\u0027d you in New \u0027Leens, let lone down dar in de kyar-shed.\" This was Miss Theodosia\u0027s introduction to Uncle Remus. One Sunday afternoon, a few weeks after her arrival, the family were assembled in the piazza enjoying the mild weather. Mr. Huntingdon was reading a newspaper; his wife was crooning softly as she rocked the baby to sleep; and the little boy was endeavoring to show his Aunt Dosia the outlines of Kennesaw Mountain through the purple haze that hung like a wonderfully fashioned curtain in the sky and almost obliterated the horizon. While they were thus engaged, Uncle Remus came around the corner of the house, talking to himself. \"Dey er too lazy ter wuk,\" he was saying, \"en dey specks hones\u0027 fokes fer ter stan\u0027 up en s\u0027port um. I\u0027m gwine down ter Putmon County whar Mars Jeems is—dat\u0027s w\u0027at I\u0027m agwine ter do.\" \"What\u0027s the matter now, Uncle Remus?\" inquired Mr. Huntingdon, folding up his newspaper. \"Nuthin\u0027 \u0027tall, Mars John, \u0027ceppin deze yer sunshine niggers. Dey begs my terbacker, en borrys my tools, en steals my vittles, en hit\u0027s done come ter dat pass dat I gotter pack up en go. I\u0027m agwine down ter Putmon, dat\u0027s w\u0027at.\" Uncle Remus was accustomed to make this threat several times a day, but upon this occasion it seemed to remind Mr. Huntingdon of something. \"Very well,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll come around and help you pack up, but before you go I want you to tell Sister here how you went to war and fought for the union.—Remus was a famous warrior,\" he continued, turning to Miss Theodosia; \"he volunteered for one day, and commanded an army of one. You know the story, but you have never heard Remus\u0027s version.\" Uncle Remus shuffled around in an awkward, embarrassed way, scratched his head, and looked uncomfortable. \"Miss Doshy ain\u0027t got no time fer ter set dar an\u0027 year de ole nigger run on.\" \"Oh, yes, I have, Uncle Remus!\" exclaimed the young lady; \"plenty of time.\" The upshot of it was that, after many ridiculous protests, Uncle Remus sat down on the steps, and proceeded to tell his story of the war. Miss Theodosia listened with great interest, but throughout it all she observed—and she was painfully conscious of the fact, as she afterward admitted—that Uncle Remus spoke from the standpoint of a Southerner, and with the air of one who expected his hearers to thoroughly sympathize with him. \"Co\u0027se,\" said Uncle Remus, addressing himself to Miss Theodosia, \"you ain\u0027t bin to Putmon, en you dunner whar de Brad Slaughter place en Harmony Grove is, but Mars John en Miss Sally, dey bin dar a time er two, en dey knows how de lan\u0027 lays. Well, den, it \u0027uz right long in dere whar Mars Jeems lived, en whar he live now. When de war come long he wuz livin\u0027 dere longer Ole Miss en Miss Sally. Ole Miss \u0027uz his ma, en Miss Sally dar \u0027uz his sister. De war come des like I tell you, en marters sorter rock along same like dey allers did. Hit didn\u0027t strike me dat dey wuz enny war gwine on, en ef I hadn\u0027t sorter miss de nabers, en seed fokes gwine outer de way fer ter ax de news, I\u0027d a \u0027lowed ter myse\u0027f dat de war wuz \u0027way off \u0027mong some yuther country. But all dis time de fuss wuz gwine on, en Mars Jeems, he wuz des eatchin\u0027 fer ter put in. Ole Miss en Miss Sally, dey tuck on so he didn\u0027t git off de fus\u0027 year, but bimeby news come down dat times wuz gittin\u0027 putty hot, en Mars Jeems he got up, he did, en say he gotter go, en go he did. He got a overseer fer ter look atter de place, en he went en jined de army. En he \u0027uz a fighter, too, mon, Mars Jeems wuz. Many\u0027s en many\u0027s de time,\" continued the old man, reflectively, \"dat I hatter take\u0027n bresh dat boy on a counter his \u0027buzin\u0027 en beatin\u0027 dem yuther boys. He went off dar fer ter fight, en he fit. Ole Miss useter call me up Sunday en read w\u0027at de papers say \u0027bout Mars Jeems, en it ho\u0027p \u0027er up might\u0027ly. I kin see \u0027er des like it \u0027uz yistiddy. \"\u0027Remus,\u0027 sez she, \u0027dish yer\u0027s w\u0027at de papers say \u0027bout my baby,\u0027 en den she\u0027d read out twel she couldn\u0027t read fer cryin\u0027. Hit went on dis way year in en year out, en dem wuz lonesome times, sho\u0027s you bawn, Miss Doshy—lonesome times, sho. Hit got hotter en hotter in de war, en lonesomer en mo\u0027 lonesomer at home, en bimeby \u0027long come de conscrip\u0027 man, en he des everlas\u0027nly scoop up Mars Jeems\u0027s overseer. W\u0027en dis come \u0027bout, ole Miss, she sont atter me en say, sez she: \"\u0027Remus, I ain\u0027t got nobody fer ter look arter de place but you,\u0027 sez she, en den I up\u0027n say, sez I: \"\u0027Mistiss, you kin des \u0027pen\u0027 on de ole nigger.\u0027 \"I wuz ole den, Miss Doshy—let lone w\u0027at I is now; en you better b\u0027leeve I bossed dem han\u0027s. I had dem niggers up en in de fiel\u0027 long \u0027fo\u0027 day, en de way dey did wuk wuz a caution. Ef dey didn\u0027t earn der vittles dat season den I ain\u0027t name Remus. But dey wuz tuk keer un. Dey had plenty er cloze en plenty er grub, en dey wuz de fattes\u0027 niggers in de settlement. \"Bimeby one day, Ole Miss, she call me up en say de Yankees done gone en tuck Atlanty—dish yer ve\u0027y town; den present\u0027y I year dey wuz a marchin\u0027 on down todes Putmon, en, lo en behol\u0027s! one day, de fus news I know\u0027d, Mars Jeems he rid up wid a whole gang er men. He des stop long nuff fer ter change hosses en snatch a mouffle er sump\u0027n ter eat, but \u0027fo\u0027 he rid off, he call me up en say, sez he: \"\u0027Daddy\u0027—all Ole Miss\u0027s chilluns call me daddy—\u0027Daddy,\u0027 he say, \u0027\u0027pears like dere\u0027s gwineter be mighty rough times \u0027roun\u0027 yer.

One time he tu\u0027n roun\u0027 en look like he wanter say sump\u0027n\u0027, but he des waf\u0027 his han\u0027—so—en gallop on. I know\u0027d den dat trouble wuz brewin\u0027. Nigger dat knows he\u0027s gwineter git thumped kin sorter fix hisse\u0027f, en I tuck\u0027n fix up like de war wuz gwineter come right in at de front gate.

Den, w\u0027en I fix all dis, I put on my Sunday cloze en groun\u0027 my axe. Two whole days I groun\u0027 dat axe. De grinestone wuz in sight er de gate en close ter de big \u0027ouse, en dar I tuck my stan\u0027. \"Bimeby one day, yer come de Yankees. Two un um come fus, en den de whole face er de yeath swawm\u0027d wid um. De fus glimpse I kotch un um, I tuck my axe en march inter Ole Miss settin\u0027-room.

Look like ter me dey wuz fixin\u0027 fer a weddin\u0027. Dar sot Ole Miss des ez prim en ez proud ez ef she own de whole county. Dis kinder ho\u0027p me up, kaze I done seed Ole Miss look dat away once befo\u0027 w\u0027en de overseer struck me in de face wid a w\u0027ip. I sot down by de fier wid my axe tween my knees. Dar we sot w\u0027iles de Yankees ransack de place. Miss Sally, dar, she got sorter restless, but Ole Miss didn\u0027t skasely bat \u0027er eyes. Bimeby, we hear steps on de peazzer, en yer come a couple er young fellers wid strops on der shoulders, en der sodes a draggin\u0027 on de flo\u0027, en der spurrers a rattlin\u0027. I won\u0027t say I wuz skeer\u0027d,\" said Uncle Remus, as though endeavoring to recall something he failed to remember, \"I won\u0027t say I wuz skeer\u0027d, kaze I wuzzent; but I wuz took\u0027n wid a mighty funny feelin\u0027 in de naberhood er de gizzard.
