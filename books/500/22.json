{"id":14375,"no":22,"title":"XX. HOW MR. RABBIT SAVED HIS MEAT","content":"\"ONE time,\" said Uncle Remus, whetting his knife slowly and thoughtfully on the palm of his hand, and gazing reflectively in the fire—\"one time Brer Wolf—\" \"Why, Uncle Remus!\" the little boy broke in, \"I thought you said the Rabbit scalded the Wolf to death a long time ago.\" The old man was fairly caught and he knew it; but this made little difference to him. A frown gathered on his usually serene brow as he turned his gaze upon the child—a frown in which both scorn and indignation were visible. Then all at once he seemed to regain control of himself. The frown was chased away by a look of Christian resignation. \"Dar now! W\u0027at I tell you?\" he exclaimed as if addressing a witness concealed under the bed. \"Ain\u0027t I done tole you so? Bless grashus! ef chilluns ain\u0027t gittin\u0027 so dey knows mo\u0027n ole fokes, en dey\u0027ll \u0027spute longer you en \u0027spute longer you, ceppin\u0027 der ma call um, w\u0027ich I speck \u0027twon\u0027t be long \u0027fo\u0027 she will, en den Ill set yere by de chimbly-cornder en git some peace er mine. W\u0027en ole Miss wuz livin\u0027,\" continued the old man, still addressing some imaginary person, \u0027hit \u0027uz mo\u0027n enny her chilluns \u0027ud dast ter do ter come \u0027sputin\u0027 longer me, en Mars John\u0027ll tell you de same enny day you ax \u0027im.\" \"Well, Uncle Remus, you know you said the Rabbit poured hot water on the Wolf and killed him,\" said the little boy. The old man pretended not to hear. He was engaged in searching among some scraps of leather under his chair, and kept on talking to the imaginary person. Finally, he found and drew forth a nicely plaited whip-thong with a red snapper all waxed and knotted. \"I wuz fixin\u0027 up a w\u0027ip fer a little chap,\" he continued, with a sigh, \"but, bless grashus! \u0027fo\u0027 I kin git \u0027er done de little chap done grow\u0027d up twel he know mo\u0027n I duz.\" The child\u0027s eyes filled with tears and his lips began to quiver, but he said nothing; whereupon Uncle Remus immediately melted. \"I \u0027clar\u0027 to goodness,\" he said, reaching out and taking the little boy tenderly by the hand, \"ef you ain\u0027t de ve\u0027y spit en image er ole Miss w\u0027en I brung \u0027er de las\u0027 news er de war. Hit\u0027s des like skeerin\u0027 up a ghos\u0027 w\u0027at you ain\u0027t fear\u0027d un.\" Then there was a pause, the old man patting the little child\u0027s hand caressingly. \"You ain\u0027t mad, is you, honey?\" Uncle Remus asked finally, \"kaze ef you is, I\u0027m gwine out yere en butt my head \u0027gin de do\u0027 jam\u0027.\" But the little boy wasn\u0027t mad. Uncle Remus had conquered him and he had conquered Uncle Remus in pretty much the same way before. But it was some time before Uncle Remus would go on with the story. He had to be coaxed. At last, however, he settled himself back in the chair and began: \"Co\u0027se, honey, hit mout er bin ole Brer Wolf, er hit mout er bin er n\u0027er Brer Wolf; it mout er bin \u0027fo\u0027 he got kotch up wid, er it mout er bin atterwards. Ez de tale wer gun to me des dat away I gin it unter you. One time Brer Wolf wuz comm\u0027 long home fum a fishin\u0027 frolic.

Dar wuz de fishes, en dar wuz Brer Rabbit, en w\u0027en dat de case w\u0027at you speck a sorter innerpen\u0027ent man like Brer Rabbit gwine do?

Brer Rabbit \u0027ny it up en down, but Brer Wolf stan\u0027 to it dat Brer Rabbit got dem fishes. Brer Rabbit, he say dat if Brer Wolf b\u0027leeve he got de fishes, den he give Brer Wolf lief fer ter kill de bes\u0027 cow he got. Brer Wolf, he tuck Brer Rabbit at his word, en go off ter de pastur\u0027 en drive up de cattle en kill Brer Rabbit bes\u0027 cow. \"Brer Rabbit, he hate mighty bad fer ter lose his cow, but he lay his plans, en he tell his chilluns dat he gwineter have dat beef yit.

En he wa\u0027n\u0027t mo\u0027n gone \u0027fo\u0027 Brer Rabbit, he whirl in en skunt de cow en salt de hide down, en den he tuck\u0027n cut up de kyarkiss en stow it \u0027way in de smoke-\u0027ouse, en den he tuck\u0027n stick de een\u0027 er de cow-tail in de groun\u0027.
