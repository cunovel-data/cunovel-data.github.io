{"id":14374,"no":21,"title":"XIX. THE FATE OF MR. JACK SPARROW","content":"\"You\u0027ll tromple on dat bark twel hit won\u0027t be fitten fer ter fling \u0027way, let \u0027lone make hoss-collars out\u0027n,\" said Uncle Remus, as the little boy came running into his cabin out of the rain. All over the floor long strips of \"wahoo\" bark were spread, and these the old man was weaving into horse-collars. \"I\u0027ll sit down, Uncle Remus,\" said the little boy. \"Well, den, you better, honey,\" responded the old man, \"kaze I \u0027spizes fer ter have my wahoo trompled on. Ef \u0027twuz shucks, now, hit mout be diffunt, but I\u0027m a gittin\u0027 too ole fer ter be projickin\u0027 \u0027longer shuck collars.\" For a few minutes the old man went on with his work, but with a solemn air altogether unusual. Once or twice he sighed deeply, and the sighs ended in a prolonged groan, that seemed to the little boy to be the result of the most unspeakable mental agony. He knew by experience that he had done something which failed to meet the approval of Uncle Remus, and he tried to remember what it was, so as to frame an excuse; but his memory failed him. He could think of nothing he had done calculated to stir Uncle Remus\u0027s grief. He was not exactly seized with remorse, but he was very uneasy. Presently Uncle Remus looked at him in a sad and hopeless way and asked: \"W\u0027at dat long rigmarole you bin tellin\u0027 Miss Sally \u0027bout yo\u0027 little brer dis mawnin?\" \"Which, Uncle Remus?\" asked the little boy, blushing guiltily. \"Dat des w\u0027at I\u0027m a axin\u0027 un you now. I hear Miss Sally say she\u0027s a gwineter stripe his jacket, en den I knowed you bin tellin\u0027 on \u0027im.\" \"Well, Uncle Remus, he was pulling up your onions, and then he went and flung a rock at me, said the child, plaintively. \"Lemme tell you dis,\" said the old man, laying down the section of horse-collar he had been plaiting, and looking hard at the little boy—\"lemme tell you dis der ain\u0027t no way fer ter make tattlers en tailb\u0027arers turn out good. No, dey ain\u0027t. I bin mixin\u0027 up wid fokes now gwine on eighty year, en I ain\u0027t seed no tattler come ter no good een\u0027. Dat I ain\u0027t. En ef ole man M\u0027thoozlum wuz livin\u0027 clean twel yit, he\u0027d up\u0027n tell you de same. Sho ez you er settin\u0027 dar. You \u0027member w\u0027at \u0027come er de bird w\u0027at went tattlin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027 \u0027bout Brer Rabbit?\" The little boy didn\u0027t remember, but he was very anxious to know, and he also wanted to know what kind of a bird it was that so disgraced itself. \"Hit wuz wunner dese yer uppity little Jack Sparrers, I speck,\" said the old man; \"dey wuz allers bodder\u0027n\u0027 longer udder fokes\u0027s bizness, en dey keeps at it down ter dis day—peckin\u0027 yer, en pickin\u0027 dar, en scratchin\u0027 out yander. One day, atter he bin fool by ole Brer Tarrypin, Brer Rabbit wuz settin\u0027 down in de woods studyin\u0027 how he wuz gwineter git even. He feel mighty lonesome, en he feel mighty mad, Brer Rabbit did. Tain\u0027t put down in de tale, but I speck he cusst en r\u0027ar\u0027d \u0027roun\u0027 considerbul. Leas\u0027ways, he wuz settin\u0027 out dar by hisse\u0027f, en dar he sot, en study en study, twel bimeby he jump up en holler out: \"\u0027Well, dog-gone my cats ef I can\u0027t gallop \u0027roun\u0027 ole Brer Fox, en I\u0027m gwineter do it. I\u0027ll show Miss Meadows en de gals dat I\u0027m de boss er Brer Fox,\u0027 sezee. \"Jack Sparrer up in de tree, he hear Brer Rabbit, he did, en he sing out: \"\u0027I\u0027m gwine tell Brer Fox! I\u0027m gwine tell Brer Fox! Chick-a-biddy-win\u0027-a-blowin\u0027-acuns-fallin\u0027! I\u0027m gwine tell Brer Fox!\"\u0027 Uncle Remus accompanied the speech of the bird with a peculiar whistling sound in his throat, that was a marvelous imitation of a sparrow\u0027s chirp, and the little boy clapped his hands with delight, and insisted on a repetition. \"Dis kinder tarrify Brer Rabbit, en he skasely know w\u0027at he gwine do; but bimeby he study ter hisse\u0027f dat de man w\u0027at see Brer Fox fus wuz boun\u0027 ter have de inturn, en den he go hoppin\u0027 off to\u0027rds home. He didn\u0027t got fur w\u0027en who should he meet but Brer Fox, en den Brer Rabbit, he open up: \"\u0027W\u0027at dis twix\u0027 you en me, Brer Fox?\u0027 sez Brer Rabbit, sezee. \u0027I hear tell you gwine ter sen\u0027 me ter \u0027struckshun, en nab my fambly, en \u0027stroy my shanty,\u0027 sezee. \"\u0027Den Brer Fox he git mighty mad. \u0027Who bin tellin\u0027 you all dis?\u0027 sezee. \"Brer Rabbit make like he didn\u0027t want ter tell, but Brer Fox he \u0027sist en \u0027sist, twel at las\u0027 Brer Rabbit he up en tell Brer Fox dat he hear Jack Sparrer say all dis. \"\u0027Co\u0027se,\u0027 sez Brer Rabbit, sezee, \u0027w\u0027en Brer Jack Sparrer tell me dat I flew up, I did, en I use some langwidge w\u0027ich I\u0027m mighty glad dey weren\u0027t no ladies \u0027round\u0027 nowhars so dey could hear me go on, sezee. \"Brer Fox he sorter gap, he did, en say he speck he better be sa\u0027nter\u0027n on.

Oh, Brer Fox!—Brer Fox!\u0027 \"Brer Fox he des sorter canter long, he did, en make like he don\u0027t hear \u0027im. Den Jack Sparrer up\u0027n sing out agin: \"\u0027Brer Fox! Oh, Brer Fox!

There is another version in which the impertinent gosling goes to tell the fox something her mother has said, and is caught; and there may be other versions. I have adhered to the middle Georgia version, which is characteristic enough. It may be well to state that there are different versions of all the stories—the shrewd narrators of the mythology of the old plantation adapting themselves with ready tact to the years, tastes, and expectations of their juvenile audiences.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2813/77744.html","bookId":500,"book":{"id":500,"title":"Uncle Remus","description":"简介： I am expected to supply a preface for this new edition of my first bookto advance from behind the curtain, as it were, and make a fresh bow to the public that has dealt with Uncle Remus in so gentle and generous a fashion.
