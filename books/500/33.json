A PLANTATION WITCH","content":"The next time the little boy got permission to call upon Uncle Remus, the old man was sitting in his door, with his elbows on his knees and his face buried in his hands, and he appeared to be in great trouble. \"What\u0027s the matter, Uncle Remus?\" the youngster asked. \"Nuff de matter, honey—mo\u0027 dan dey\u0027s enny kyo\u0027 fer. Ef dey ain\u0027t some quare gwines on \u0027roun\u0027 dis place I ain\u0027t name Remus.\" The serious tone of the old man caused the little boy to open his eyes. The moon, just at its full, cast long, vague, wavering shadows in front of the cabin. A colony of tree-frogs somewhere in the distance were treating their neighbors to a serenade, but to the little boy it sounded like a chorus of lost and long- forgotten whistlers. The sound was wherever the imagination chose to locate it—to the right, to the left, in the air, on the ground, far away or near at hand, but always dim and always indistinct. Something in Uncle Remus\u0027s tone exactly fitted all these surroundings, and the child nestled closer to the old man. \"Yasser,\" continued Uncle Remus, with an ominous sigh and mysterious shake of the head, \"ef dey ain\u0027t some quare gwines on in dish yer naberhood, den I\u0027m de ball-headest creetur \u0027twix\u0027 dis en nex\u0027 Jinawerry wuz a year \u0027go, w\u0027ich I knows I ain\u0027t. Dat\u0027s what.\" \"What is it, Uncle Remus?\" \"I know Mars John bin drivin\u0027 Cholly sorter hard ter-day, en I say ter myse\u0027f dat I\u0027d drap \u0027round \u0027bout dus\u0027 en fling nudder year er corn in de troff en kinder gin \u0027im a techin\u0027 up wid de kurrier-koam; en bless grashus! I ain\u0027t bin in de lot mo\u0027n a minnit \u0027fo\u0027 I seed sump\u0027n wuz wrong wid de hoss, and sho\u0027 nuff dar wuz his mane full er witch-stirrups.\" \"Full of what, Uncle Remus?\" \"Full er witch-stirrups, honey. Ain\u0027t you seed no witch-stirrups? Well, w\u0027en you see two stran\u0027 er ha\u0027r tied tergedder in a hoss\u0027s mane, dar you see a witch-stirrup, en, mo\u0027n dat, dat hoss done bin rid by um.\" \"Do you reckon they have been riding Charley?\" inquired the little boy. \"Co\u0027se, honey. Tooby sho dey is. W\u0027at else dey bin doin\u0027?\" \"Did you ever see a witch, Uncle Remus?\" \"Dat ain\u0027t needer yer ner dar. W\u0027en I see coon track in de branch, I know de coon bin \u0027long dar.\" The argument seemed unanswerable, and the little boy asked, in a confidential tone: \"Uncle Remus, what are witches like?\" \"Dey comes diffunt,\" responded the cautious old darkey. \"Dey comes en dey cunjus fokes. Squinch-owl holler eve\u0027y time he see a witch, en w\u0027en you hear de dog howlin\u0027 in de middle er de night, one un um\u0027s mighty ap\u0027 ter be prowlin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027. Cunjun fokes kin tell a witch de minnit dey lays der eyes on it, but dem w\u0027at ain\u0027t cunjun, hit\u0027s mighty hard ter tell w\u0027en dey see one, kaze dey might come in de \u0027pearunce un a cow en all kinder creeturs. I ain\u0027t bin useter no cunjun myse\u0027f, but I bin livin\u0027 long nuff fer ter know w\u0027en you meets up wid a big black cat in de middle er de road, wid yaller eyeballs, dar\u0027s yo\u0027 witch fresh fum de Ole Boy. En, fuddermo\u0027, I know dat \u0027tain\u0027t proned inter no dogs fer ter ketch de rabbit w\u0027at use in a berryin\u0027-groun\u0027. Dey er de mos\u0027 ongodlies\u0027 creeturs w\u0027at you ever laid eyes on,\" continued Uncle Remus, with unction. \"Down dar in Putmon County yo\u0027 Unk Jeems, he make like he gwineter ketch wunner dem dar graveyard rabbits. Sho nuff, out he goes, en de dogs ain\u0027t no mo\u0027n got ter de place fo\u0027 up jump de old rabbit right \u0027mong um, en atter runnin\u0027\u0027roun\u0027 a time or two, she skip right up ter Mars Jeems, en Mars Jeems, he des put de gun-bar\u0027l right on \u0027er en lammed aloose. Hit tored up de groun\u0027 all \u0027roun\u0027, en de dogs, dey rush up, but dey wa\u0027n\u0027t no rabbit dar; but bimeby Mars Jeems, he seed de dogs tuckin\u0027 der tails \u0027tween der legs, en he look up, en dar wuz de rabbit caperin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027 on a toom stone, en wid dat Mars Jeems say he sorter feel like de time done come w\u0027en yo\u0027 gran\u0027ma was \u0027specktin\u0027 un him home, en he call off de dogs en put out. But dem wuz ha\u0027nts. Witches is deze yer kinder fokes w\u0027at kin drap der body en change inter a cat en a wolf en all kinder creeturs.\" \"Papa says there ain\u0027t any witches,\" the little boy interrupted. \"Mars John ain\u0027t live long ez I is,\" said Uncle Remus, by way of comment. \"He ain\u0027t bin broozin\u0027 roun\u0027 all hours er de night en day. I know\u0027d a nigger w\u0027ich his brer wuz a witch, kaze he up\u0027n tole me how he tuck\u0027n kyo\u0027d \u0027im; en he kyo\u0027d \u0027im good, mon.\" \"How was that?\" inquired the little boy. \"Hit seem like,\" continued Uncle Remus, \"dat witch fokes is got a slit in de back er de neck, en w\u0027en dey wanter change derse\u0027f, dey des pull de hide over der head same ez if \u0027twuz a shut, en dar dey is.\" \"Do they get out of their skins?\" asked the little boy, in an awed tone. \"Tooby sho, honey. You see yo\u0027 pa pull his shut off? Well, dat des \u0027zackly de way dey duz. But dish yere nigger w\u0027at I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you \u0027bout, he kyo\u0027d his brer de ve\u0027y fus pass he made at him. Hit got so dat fokes in de settlement didn\u0027t have no peace. De chilluns \u0027ud wake up in de mawnins wid der ha\u0027r tangle up, en wid scratches on um like dey bin thoo a brier-patch, twel bimeby one day de nigger he \u0027low dat he\u0027d set up dat night en keep one eye on his brer; en sho\u0027 nuff dat night, des ez de chickens wuz crowin\u0027 fer twelve, up jump de brer and pull off his skin en sail out\u0027n de house in de shape un a bat, en w\u0027at duz de nigger do but grab up de hide, and turn it wrong-sudout\u0027ards en sprinkle it wid salt. Den he lay down en watch fer ter see w\u0027at de news wuz gwineter be. Des \u0027fo\u0027 day yer come a big black cat in de do\u0027, en de nigger git up, he did, en druv her away. Bimeby, yer come a big black dog snuffin\u0027 roun\u0027, en de nigger up wid a chunk en lammed \u0027im side er de head. Den a squinch-owl lit on de koam er de house, en de nigger jam de shovel in de fier en make \u0027im flew away. Las\u0027, yer come a great big black wolf wid his eyes shinin\u0027 like fier coals, en he grab de hide and rush out. \u0027Twa\u0027n\u0027t long \u0027fo\u0027 de nigger year his brer holler\u0027n en squallin\u0027, en he tuck a light, he did, en went out, en dar wuz his brer des a waller\u0027n on de groun\u0027 en squirmin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027, kaze de salt on de skin wuz stingin\u0027 wuss\u0027n ef he had his britches lineded wid yallerjackets. By nex\u0027 mawnin\u0027 he got so he could sorter shuffle long, but he gun up cunjun, en ef dere wuz enny mo\u0027 witches in dat settlement dey kep\u0027 mighty close, en dat nigger he ain\u0027t skunt hisse\u0027f no mo\u0027 not endurin\u0027 er my \u0027membunce.\" The result of this was that Uncle Remus had to take the little boy by the hand and go with him to the \"big house,\" which the old man was not loath to do; and, when the child went to bed, he lay awake a long time expecting an unseemly visitation from some mysterious source. It soothed him, however, to hear the strong, musical voice of his sable patron, not very far away, tenderly contending with a lusty tune; and to this accompaniment the little boy dropped asleep: \"Hit\u0027s eighteen hunder\u0027d, forty-en-eight, Christ done made dat crooked way straight— En I don\u0027t wanter stay here no longer; Hit\u0027s eighteen hunder\u0027d, forty-en-nine, Christ done turn dat water inter wine— En I don\u0027t wanter stay here no longer.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2813/77756.html","bookId":500,"book":{"id":500,"title":"Uncle Remus","description":"简介： I am expected to supply a preface for this new edition of my first bookto advance from behind the curtain, as it were, and make a fresh bow to the public that has dealt with Uncle Remus in so gentle and generous a fashion.
