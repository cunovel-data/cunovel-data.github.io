{"id":14388,"no":35,"title":"XXXIII. WHY THE NEGRO IS BLACK","content":"ONE night, while the little boy was watching Uncle Remus twisting and waxing some shoe-thread, he made what appeared to him to be a very curious discovery. He discovered that the palms of the old man\u0027s hands were as white as his own, and the fact was such a source of wonder that he at last made it the subject of remark. The response of Uncle Remus led to the earnest recital of a piece of unwritten history that must prove interesting to ethnologists. \"Tooby sho de pa\u0027m er my han\u0027s w\u0027ite, honey,\" he quietly remarked, \"en, w\u0027en it come ter dat, dey wuz a time w\u0027en all de w\u0027ite folks \u0027uz black—blacker dan me, kaze I done bin yer so long dat I bin sorter bleach out.\" The little boy laughed. He thought Uncle Remus was making him the victim of one of his jokes; but the youngster was never more mistaken. The old man was serious. Nevertheless, he failed to rebuke the ill-timed mirth of the child, appearing to be altogether engrossed in his work. After a while, he resumed: \"Yasser. Fokes dunner w\u0027at bin yit, let \u0027lone w\u0027at gwinter be. Niggers is niggers now, but de time wuz w\u0027en we \u0027uz all niggers tergedder.\" \"When was that, Uncle Remus?\" \"Way back yander. In dem times we \u0027uz all un us black; we \u0027uz all niggers tergedder, en \u0027cordin\u0027 ter all de \u0027counts w\u0027at I years fokes \u0027uz gittin\u0027 \u0027long \u0027bout ez well in dem days ez dey is now. But atter \u0027w\u0027ile de news come dat dere wuz a pon\u0027 er water some\u0027rs in de naberhood, w\u0027ich ef dey\u0027d git inter dey\u0027d be wash off nice en w\u0027ite, en den one un um, he fine de place en make er splunge inter de pon\u0027, en come out w\u0027ite ez a town gal. En den, bless grashus! w\u0027en de fokes seed it, dey make a break fer de pon\u0027, en dem w\u0027at wuz de soopless, dey got in fus\u0027 en dey come out w\u0027ite; en dem w\u0027at wuz de nex\u0027 soopless, dey got in nex\u0027, en dey come out merlatters; en dey wuz sech a crowd un um dat dey mighty nigh use de water up, w\u0027ich w\u0027en dem yuthers come long, de morest dey could do wuz ter paddle about wid der foots en dabble in it wid der han\u0027s.

I ain\u0027t seed no Chinee dat I knows un, but dey tells me dey er sorter \u0027twix\u0027 a brown en a brindle. Dey er all merlatters.\" \"But mamma says the Chinese have straight hair,\" the little boy suggested. \"Co\u0027se, honey,\" the old man unhesitatingly responded, \"dem w\u0027at git ter de pon\u0027 time nuff fer ter git der head in de water, de water hit onkink der ha\u0027r.
