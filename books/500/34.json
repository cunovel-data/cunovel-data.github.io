Uncle Remus had a board across his lap, and, armed with a mallet and a shoe-knife, was engaged in making shoe-pegs. \"W\u0027iles I wuz crossin\u0027 de branch des now,\" he said, endeavoring to change the subject, \"I come up wid a Jacky-my-lantern, en she wuz bu\u0027nin\u0027 wuss\u0027n a bunch er lightnin\u0027-bugs, mon.

You ain\u0027t never seed no Jacky-my-lanterns, is you, honey?\" The little boy never had, but he had heard of them, and he wanted to know what they were, and thereupon Uncle Remus proceeded to tell him. \"One time,\" said the old darkey, transferring his spectacles from his nose to the top of his head and leaning his elbows upon his peg-board, \"dere wuz a blacksmif man, en dish yer blacksmif man, he tuck\u0027n stuck closer by his dram dan he did by his bellus.

It is a trifle too elaborate. Nevertheless, it is told upon the plantations with great gusto, and there are several versions in circulation. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2813/77757.html","bookId":500,"book":{"id":500,"title":"Uncle Remus","description":"简介： I am expected to supply a preface for this new edition of my first bookto advance from behind the curtain, as it were, and make a fresh bow to the public that has dealt with Uncle Remus in so gentle and generous a fashion.
