FOX IS AGAIN VICTIMIZED","content":"WHEN \"Miss Sally\u0027s\" little boy went to Uncle Remus the next night to hear the conclusion of the adventure in which the Rabbit made a riding-horse of the Fox to the great enjoyment and gratification of Miss Meadows and the girls, he found the old man in a bad humor. \"I ain\u0027t tellin\u0027 no tales ter bad chilluns,\" said Uncle Remus curtly. \"But, Uncle Remus, I ain\u0027t bad,\" said the little boy plaintively. \"Who dat chunkin\u0027 dem chickens dis mawnin? Who dat knockin\u0027 out fokes\u0027s eyes wid dat Yallerbammer sling des \u0027fo\u0027 dinner? Who dat sickin\u0027 dat pinter puppy atter my pig? Who dat scatterin\u0027 my ingun sets? Who dat flingin\u0027 rocks on top er my house, w\u0027ich a little mo\u0027 en one un em would er drap spang on my head?\" \"Well, now, Uncle Remus, I didn\u0027t go to do it. I won\u0027t do so any more. Please, Uncle Remus, if you will tell me, I\u0027ll run to the house and bring you some tea-cakes.\" \"Seein\u0027 um\u0027s better\u0027n hearin\u0027 tell un um, replied the old man, the severity of his countenance relaxing somewhat; but the little boy darted out, and in a few minutes came running back with his pockets full and his hands full. \"I lay yo\u0027 mammy \u0027ll \u0027spishun dat de rats\u0027 stummicks is widenin\u0027 in dis neighborhood w\u0027en she come fer ter count up \u0027er cakes,\" said Uncle Remus, with a chuckle. \"Deze,\" he continued, dividing the cakes into two equal parts—\"dese I\u0027ll tackle now, en dese I\u0027ll lay by fer Sunday. \"Lemme see. I mos\u0027 dis\u0027member wharbouts Brer Fox en Brer Rabbit wuz.\" \"The rabbit rode the fox to Miss Meadows\u0027s, and hitched him to the horse-rack,\" said the little boy. \"W\u0027y co\u0027se he did,\" said Uncle Remus. \"C\u0027ose he did. Well, Brer Rabbit rid Brer Fox up, he did, en tied \u0027im to de rack, en den sot out in de peazzer wid de gals a smokin\u0027 er his seegyar wid mo\u0027 proudness dan w\u0027at you mos\u0027 ever see. Dey talk, en dey sing, en dey play on de peanner, de gals did, twel bimeby hit come time fer Brer Rabbit fer to be gwine, en he tell um all good-by, en strut out to de hoss-rack same\u0027s ef he wuz de king er de patter- rollers,*1 en den he mount Brer Fox en ride off. \"Brer Fox ain\u0027t sayin\u0027 nuthin\u0027 \u0027tall. He des rack off, he did, en keep his mouf shet, en Brer Rabbit know\u0027d der wuz bizness cookin\u0027 up fer him, en he feel monstus skittish. Brer Fox amble on twel he git in de long lane, outer sight er Miss Meadows\u0027s house, en den he tu\u0027n loose, he did. He rip en he ra\u0027r, en he cuss, en he swar; he snort en he cavort.\" \"What was he doing that for, Uncle Remus?\" the little boy inquired. \"He wuz tryin\u0027 fer ter fling Brer Rabbit off\u0027n his back, bless yo\u0027 soul! But he des might ez well er rastle wid his own shadder. Every time he hump hisse\u0027f Brer Rabbit slap de spurrers in \u0027im, en dar dey had it, up en down. Brer Fox fa\u0027rly to\u0027 up de groun\u0027 he did, en he jump so high en he jump so quick dat he mighty nigh snatch his own tail off. Dey kep\u0027 on gwine on dis way twel bimeby Brer Fox lay down en roll over, he did, en dis sorter onsettle Brer Rabbit, but by de time Brer Fox got back on his footses agin, Brer Rabbit wuz gwine thoo de underbresh mo\u0027 samer dan a race-hoss. Brer Fox he lit out atter \u0027im, he did, en he push Brer Rabbit so close dat it wuz \u0027bout all he could do fer ter git in a holler tree. Hole too little fer Brer Fox fer ter git in, en he hatter lay down en res en gedder his mine tergedder. \"While he wuz layin\u0027 dar, Mr. Buzzard come floppin\u0027 \u0027long, en seein\u0027 Brer Fox stretch out on de groun\u0027, he lit en view de premusses. Den Mr. Buzzard sorter shake his wing, en put his head on one side, en say to hisse\u0027f like, sezee: \"\u0027Brer Fox dead, en I so sorry,\u0027 sezee. \"\u0027No I ain\u0027t dead, nudder,\u0027 sez Brer Fox, sezee. \u0027I got ole man Rabbit pent up in yer,\u0027 sezee, \u0027en I\u0027m a gwine ter git \u0027im dis time ef it take twel Chris\u0027mus,\u0027 sezee. \"Den, atter some mo\u0027 palaver, Brer Fox make a bargain dat Mr. Buzzard wuz ter watch de hole, en keep Brer Rabbit dar wiles Brer Fox went atter his axe. Den Brer Fox, he lope off, he did, en Mr. Buzzard, he tuck up his stan\u0027 at de hole. Bimeby, w\u0027en all git still, Brer Rabbit sorter scramble down close ter de hole, he did, en holler out: \"\u0027Brer Fox! Oh! Brer Fox!\u0027 \"Brer Fox done gone, en nobody say nuthin\u0027. Den Brer Rabbit squall out like he wuz mad; sezee: \"\u0027You needn\u0027t talk less you wanter,\u0027 sezee; \u0027I knows you er dar, en I ain\u0027t keerin\u0027,\u0027 sezee. \u0027I des wanter tell you dat I wish mighty bad Brer Tukkey Buzzard wuz here,\u0027 sezee. \"Den Mr. Buzzard try ter talk like Brer Fox: \"\u0027W\u0027at you want wid Mr. Buzzard?\u0027 sezee. \"\u0027Oh, nuthin\u0027 in \u0027tickler, \u0027cep\u0027 dere\u0027s de fattes\u0027 gray squir\u0027l in yer dat ever I see,\u0027 sezee, \u0027en ef Brer Tukkey Buzzard wuz \u0027roun\u0027 he\u0027d be mighty glad fer ter git \u0027im,\u0027 sezee. \"\u0027How Mr. Buzzard gwine ter git \u0027im?\u0027 sez de Buzzard, sezee. \"\u0027Well, dar\u0027s a little hole roun\u0027 on de udder side er de tree,\u0027 sez Brer Rabbit, sezee, \u0027en ef Brer Tukkey Buzzard wuz here so he could take up his stan\u0027 dar,\u0027 sezee, \u0027I\u0027d drive dat squir\u0027l out,\u0027 sezee. \"\u0027Drive \u0027im out, den,\u0027 sez Mr. Buzzard, sezee, \u0027en I\u0027ll see dat Brer Tukkey Buzzard gits \u0027im,\u0027 sezee. \"Den Brer Rabbit kick up a racket, like he wer\u0027 drivin\u0027 sumpin\u0027 out, en Mr. Buzzard he rush \u0027roun\u0027 fer ter ketch de squir\u0027l, en Brer Rabbit, he dash out, he did, en he des fly fer home.\" At this point Uncle Remus took one of the teacakes, held his head back, opened his mouth, dropped the cake in with a sudden motion, looked at the little boy with an expression of astonishment, and then closed his eyes, and begun to chew, mumbling as an accompaniment the plaintive tune of \"Don\u0027t you Grieve atter Me.\" The seance was over; but, before the little boy went into the \"big house,\" Uncle Remus laid his rough hand tenderly on the child\u0027s shoulder, and remarked, in a confidential tone: \"Honey, you mus\u0027 git up soon Chris\u0027mus mawnin\u0027 en open de do\u0027; kase I\u0027m gwineter bounce in on Marse John en Miss Sally, en holler \u0027Chris\u0027mus gif\u0027\u0027 des like I useter endurin\u0027 de farmin\u0027 days fo\u0027 de war, w\u0027en ole Miss wuz \u0027live.

In the country districts, order was kept on the plantations at night by the knowledge that they were liable to be visited at any moment by the patrols. Hence a song current among the negroes, the chorus of which was: \"Run, nigger, run; patter-roller ketch you— Run, nigger, run; hit\u0027s almos\u0027 day.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2813/77732.html","bookId":500,"book":{"id":500,"title":"Uncle Remus","description":"简介： I am expected to supply a preface for this new edition of my first bookto advance from behind the curtain, as it were, and make a fresh bow to the public that has dealt with Uncle Remus in so gentle and generous a fashion.
