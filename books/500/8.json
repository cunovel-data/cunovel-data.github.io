FOX","content":"ONE evening when the little boy, whose nights with Uncle Remus were as entertaining as those Arabian ones of blessed memory, had finished supper and hurried out to sit with his venerable patron, he found the old man in great glee. Indeed, Uncle Remus was talking and laughing to himself at such a rate that the little boy was afraid he had company. The truth is, Uncle Remus had heard the child coming, and, when the rosy-cheeked chap put his head in at the door, was engaged in a monologue, the burden of which seemed to be— \"Ole Molly Har\u0027, W\u0027at you doin\u0027 dar, Settin\u0027 in de cornder Smokin\u0027 yo\u0027 seegyar?\" As a matter of course this vague allusion reminded the little boy of the fact that the wicked Fox was still in pursuit of the Rabbit, and he immediately put his curiosity in the shape of a question. \"Uncle Remus, did the Rabbit have to go clean away when he got loose from the Tar-Baby?\" \"Bless gracious, honey, dat he didn\u0027t. Who? Him? You dunno nuthin\u0027 \u0027tall \u0027bout Brer Rabbit ef dat\u0027s de way you puttin\u0027 \u0027im down. W\u0027at he gwine \u0027way fer?
