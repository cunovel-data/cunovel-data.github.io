{"id":14369,"no":16,"title":"XIV. MR. FOX AND THE DECEITFUL FROGS","content":"WHEN the little boy ran in to see Uncle Remus the night after he had told him of the awful fate of Brer Wolf, the only response to his greeting was: \"I-doom-er-ker-kum-mer-ker!\" No explanation could convey an adequate idea of the intonation and pronunciation which Uncle Remus brought to bear upon this wonderful word. Those who can recall to mind the peculiar gurgling, jerking, liquid sound made by pouring water from a large jug, or the sound produced by throwing several stones in rapid succession into a pond of deep water, may be able to form a very faint idea of the sound, but it can not be reproduced in print. The little boy was astonished. \"What did you say, Uncle Remus?\" \"I-doom-er-ker-kum-mer-ker! I-doom-er-ker-kum mer-ker!\" \"What is that?\" \"Dat\u0027s Tarrypin talk, dat is. Bless yo\u0027 soul, honey,\" continued the old man, brightening up, \"w\u0027en you git ole ez me—w\u0027en you see w\u0027at I sees, en year w\u0027at I years—de creeturs dat you can\u0027t talk wid\u0027ll be mighty skase—dey will dat.

Des now, w\u0027en you run in and broke me up, I wuz fetchin\u0027 into my mine w\u0027at Brer Tarrypin say ter Brer Fox w\u0027en he turn \u0027im loose in de branch.\" \"What did he say, Uncle Remus?\" \"Dat w\u0027at he said—I-doom-er-ker-kum-mer-ker!
