{"id":1040,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5:1 [hgb] 凡 信 耶 稣 是 基 督 的 ， 都 是 从 神 而 生 。 凡 爱 生 他 之 神 的 ， 也 必 爱 从 神 生 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. \\n\\n [bbe] Everyone who has faith that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God: and everyone who has love for the Father has love for his child. \\n\\n 5:2 [hgb] 我 们 若 爱 神 ， 又 遵 守 他 的 诫 命 ， 从 此 就 知 道 我 们 爱 神 的 儿 女 。 \\n\\n [kjv] By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. \\n\\n [bbe] In this way, we are certain that we have love for the children of God, when we have love for God and keep his laws. \\n\\n 5:3 [hgb] 我 们 遵 守 神 的 诫 命 ， 这 就 是 爱 他 了 。 并 且 他 的 诫 命 不 是 难 守 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. \\n\\n [bbe] For loving God is keeping his laws: and his laws are not hard. \\n\\n 5:4 [hgb] 因 为 凡 从 神 生 的 ， 就 胜 过 世 界 。 使 我 们 胜 了 世 界 的 ， 就 是 我 们 的 信 心 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. \\n\\n [bbe] Anything which comes from God is able to overcome the world: and the power by which we have overcome the world is our faith. \\n\\n 5:5 [hgb] 胜 过 世 界 的 是 谁 呢 ？ 不 是 那 信 耶 稣 是 神 儿 子 的 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? \\n\\n [bbe] Who is able to overcome the world but the man who has faith that Jesus is the Son of God? \\n\\n 5:6 [hgb] 这 借 着 水 和 血 而 来 的 就 是 耶 稣 基 督 。 不 是 单 用 水 ， 乃 是 用 水 又 用 血 。 \\n\\n [kjv] This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. \\n\\n [bbe] This is he who came by water and by blood, Jesus Christ; not by water only but by water and by blood. \\n\\n 5:7 [hgb] 并 且 有 圣 灵 作 见 证 ， 因 为 圣 灵 就 是 真 理 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is true. \\n\\n 5:8 [hgb] 作 见 证 的 原 来 有 三 ， 就 是 圣 灵 ， 水 ， 与 血 。 这 三 样 也 都 归 于 一 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. \\n\\n [bbe] There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood: and all three are in agreement. \\n\\n 5:9 [hgb] 我 们 既 领 受 人 的 见 证 ， 神 的 见 证 更 该 领 受 了 。 （ 该 领 受 原 文 作 大 ） 。 因 神 的 见 证 ， 是 为 他 儿 子 作 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. \\n\\n [bbe] If we take the witness of men to be true, the witness of God is greater: because this is the witness which God has given about his Son. \\n\\n 5:10 [hgb] 信 神 儿 子 的 ， 就 有 这 见 证 在 他 心 里 。 不 信 神 的 ， 就 是 将 神 当 作 说 谎 的 。 因 不 信 神 为 他 儿 子 作 的 见 证 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. \\n\\n [bbe] He who has faith in the Son of God has the witness in himself: he who has not faith in God makes him false, because he has not faith in the witness which God has given about his Son. \\n\\n 5:11 [hgb] 这 见 证 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 我 们 永 生 ， 这 永 生 也 是 在 他 儿 子 里 面 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. \\n\\n [bbe] And his witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. \\n\\n 5:12 [hgb] 人 有 了 神 的 儿 子 就 有 生 命 。 没 有 神 的 儿 子 就 没 有 生 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. \\n\\n [bbe] He who has the Son has the life; he who has not the Son of God has not the life. \\n\\n 5:13 [hgb] 我 将 这 些 话 写 给 你 们 信 奉 神 儿 子 之 名 的 人 ， 要 叫 你 们 知 道 自 己 有 永 生 。 \\n\\n [kjv] These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. \\n\\n [bbe] I have put these things in writing for you who have faith in the name of the Son of God, so that you may be certain that you have eternal life. \\n\\n 5:14 [hgb] 我 们 若 照 他 的 旨 意 求 什 么 ， 他 就 听 我 们 。 这 是 我 们 向 他 所 存 坦 然 无 惧 的 心 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: \\n\\n [bbe] And we are certain that if we make any request to him which is right in his eyes, he will give ear to us: \\n\\n 5:15 [hgb] 既 然 知 道 他 听 我 们 一 切 所 求 的 ， 就 知 道 我 们 所 求 于 他 的 无 不 得 着 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. \\n\\n [bbe] And if we are certain that he gives ear to all our requests, we are equally certain that we will get our requests. \\n\\n 5:16 [hgb] 人 若 看 见 弟 兄 犯 了 不 至 于 死 的 罪 ， 就 当 为 他 祈 求 ， 神 必 将 生 命 赐 给 他 。 有 至 于 死 的 罪 ， 我 不 说 当 为 这 罪 祈 求 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. \\n\\n [bbe] If a man sees his brother doing a sin which is not bad enough for death, let him make a prayer to God, and God will give life to him whose sin was not bad enough for death. There is a sin whose punishment is death: I do not say that he may make such a request then. \\n\\n 5:17 [hgb] 凡 不 义 的 事 都 是 罪 。 也 有 不 至 于 死 的 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. \\n\\n [bbe] All evil-doing is sin: but death is not the punishment for every sort of sin. \\n\\n 5:18 [hgb] 我 们 知 道 凡 从 神 生 的 必 不 犯 罪 。 从 神 生 的 必 保 守 自 己 ， （ 有 古 卷 作 那 从 神 生 的 必 保 护 他 ） ， 那 恶 者 也 就 无 法 害 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. \\n\\n [bbe] We are certain that one who is a child of God will do no sin, but the Son of God keeps him so that he is not touched by the Evil One. \\n\\n 5:19 [hgb] 我 们 知 道 我 们 是 属 神 的 ， 全 世 界 都 卧 在 那 恶 者 手 下 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. \\n\\n [bbe] We are certain that we are of God, but all the world is in the power of the Evil One. \\n\\n 5:20 [hgb] 我 们 也 知 道 神 的 儿 子 已 经 来 到 ， 且 将 智 慧 赐 给 我 们 ， 使 我 们 认 识 那 位 真 实 的 ， 我 们 也 在 那 位 真 实 的 里 面 ， 就 是 在 他 儿 子 耶 稣 基 督 里 面 。 这 是 真 神 ， 也 是 永 生 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. \\n\\n [bbe] And we are certain that the Son of God has come, and has given us a clear vision, so that we may see him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. \\n\\n 5:21 [hgb] 小 子 们 哪 ， 你 们 要 自 守 ， 远 避 偶 像 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. \\n\\n [bbe] My little children, keep yourselves from false gods. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/192/2365.html","bookId":37,"book":{"id":37,"title":"约翰一书 1 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 论 到 从 起 初 原 有 的 生 命 之 道 ， 就 是 我 们 所 听 见 所 看 见 ， 亲 眼 看 过 ， 亲 手 摸 过 的 。 [kjv] That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with ou...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/192","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:23 AM"}}
