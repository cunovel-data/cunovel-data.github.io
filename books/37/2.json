{"id":1037,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"2:1 [hgb] 我 小 子 们 哪 ， 我 将 这 些 话 写 给 你 们 ， 是 要 叫 你 们 不 犯 罪 。 若 有 人 犯 罪 ， 在 父 那 里 我 们 有 一 位 中 保 ， 就 是 那 义 者 耶 稣 基 督 。 [kjv] My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: [bbe] My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may be without sin. And if any man is a sinner, we have a friend and helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, the upright one: 2:2 [hgb] 他 为 我 们 的 罪 作 了 挽 回 祭 。 不 是 单 为 我 们 的 罪 ， 也 是 为 普 天 下 人 的 罪 。 [kjv] And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. [bbe] He is the offering for our sins; and not for ours only, but for all the world. 2:3 [hgb] 我 们 若 遵 守 他 的 诫 命 ， 就 晓 得 是 认 识 他 。 [kjv] And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. [bbe] And by this we may be certain that we have knowledge of him, if we keep his laws. 2:4 [hgb] 人 若 说 我 认 识 他 ， 却 不 遵 守 他 的 诫 命 ， 便 是 说 谎 话 的 。 真 理 也 不 在 他 心 里 了 。 [kjv] He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. [bbe] The man who says, I have knowledge of him, and does not keep his laws, is false, and there is nothing true in him: 2:5 [hgb] 凡 遵 守 主 道 的 ， 爱 神 的 心 在 他 里 面 实 在 是 完 全 的 ， 从 此 我 们 知 道 我 们 是 在 主 里 面 。 [kjv] But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. [bbe] But in every man who keeps his word, the love of God is made complete. By this we may be certain that we are in him: 2:6 [hgb] 人 若 说 他 住 在 主 里 面 ， 就 该 自 己 照 主 所 行 的 去 行 。 [kjv] He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. [bbe] He who says that he is living in him, will do as he did. 2:7 [hgb] 亲 爱 的 弟 兄 阿 ， 我 写 给 你 们 的 ， 不 是 一 条 新 命 令 ， 乃 是 你 们 从 起 初 所 受 的 旧 命 令 。 这 旧 命 令 就 是 你 们 所 听 见 的 道 。 [kjv] Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. [bbe] My loved ones, I do not give you a new law, but an old law which you had from the first; this old law is the word which came to your ears. 2:8 [hgb] 再 者 ， 我 写 给 你 们 的 ， 是 一 条 新 命 令 ， 在 主 是 真 的 ， 在 你 们 也 是 真 的 。 因 为 黑 暗 渐 渐 过 去 ， 真 光 已 经 照 耀 。 [kjv] Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. [bbe] Again, I give you a new law, which is true in him and in you; for the night is near its end and the true light is even now shining out. 2:9 [hgb] 人 若 说 自 己 在 光 明 中 。 却 恨 他 的 弟 兄 ， 他 到 如 今 还 是 在 黑 暗 里 。 [kjv] He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. [bbe] He who says that he is in the light, and has hate in his heart for his brother, is still in the dark. 2:10 [hgb] 爱 弟 兄 的 就 是 住 在 光 明 中 ， 在 他 并 没 有 绊 跌 的 缘 由 。 [kjv] He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. [bbe] He who has love for his brother is in the light, and there is no cause of error in him. 2:11 [hgb] 惟 独 恨 弟 兄 的 是 在 黑 暗 里 ， 且 在 黑 暗 里 行 ， 也 不 知 道 往 哪 里 去 ， 因 为 黑 暗 叫 他 眼 睛 瞎 了 。 [kjv] But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. [bbe] But he who has hate for his brother is in the dark, walking in the dark with no knowledge of where he is going, unable to see because of the dark. 2:12 [hgb] 小 子 们 哪 ， 我 写 信 给 你 们 ， 因 为 你 们 的 罪 借 着 主 名 得 了 赦 免 。 [kjv] I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name\u0027s sake. [bbe] I am writing to you, my children, because you have forgiveness of sins through his name. 2:13 [hgb] 父 老 阿 ， 我 写 信 给 你 们 ， 因 为 你 们 认 识 那 从 起 初 原 有 的 。 少 年 人 哪 ， 我 写 信 给 你 们 ， 因 为 你 们 胜 了 那 恶 者 。 小 子 们 哪 ， 我 曾 写 信 给 你 们 ， 因 为 你 们 认 识 父 。 [kjv] I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. [bbe] I am writing to you, fathers, because you have knowledge of him who was from the first. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the Evil One. I have sent a letter to you, children, because you have knowledge of the Father. 2:14 [hgb] 父 老 阿 ， 我 曾 写 信 给 你 们 ， 因 为 你 们 认 识 那 从 起 初 原 有 的 。 少 年 人 哪 ， 我 曾 写 信 给 你 们 ， 因 为 你 们 刚 强 ， 神 的 道 常 存 在 你 们 心 里 ， 你 们 也 胜 了 那 恶 者 。 [kjv] I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. [bbe] I have sent a letter to you, fathers, because you have knowledge of him who was from the first. I have sent a letter to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God is in you, and because you have overcome the Evil One. 2:15 [hgb] 不 要 爱 世 界 ， 和 世 界 上 的 事 。 人 若 爱 世 界 ， 爱 父 的 心 就 不 在 他 里 面 了 。 [kjv] Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. [bbe] Have no love for the world or for the things which are in the world. If any man has love for the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 2:16 [hgb] 因 为 凡 世 界 上 的 事 ， 就 像 肉 体 的 情 欲 ， 眼 目 的 情 欲 ， 并 今 生 的 骄 傲 ， 都 不 是 从 父 来 的 ， 乃 是 从 世 界 来 的 。 [kjv] For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. [bbe] Because everything in the world, the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father but of the world. 2:17 [hgb] 这 世 界 ， 和 其 上 的 情 欲 ， 都 要 过 去 。 惟 独 遵 行 神 旨 意 的 ， 是 永 远 常 存 。 [kjv] And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. [bbe] And the world and its desires is coming to an end: but he who does God\u0027s pleasure is living for ever. 2:18 [hgb] 小 子 们 哪 ， 如 今 是 末 时 了 。 你 们 曾 听 见 说 ， 那 敌 基 督 的 要 来 现 在 已 经 有 好 些 敌 基 督 的 出 来 了 。 从 此 我 们 就 知 道 如 今 是 末 时 了 。 [kjv] Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. [bbe] Little children, it is the last hour; and as you were given word that the Antichrist would come, so now a number of Antichrists have come to you; and by this we are certain that it is the last hour. 2:19 [hgb] 他 们 从 我 们 中 间 出 去 ， 却 不 是 属 我 们 的 。 若 是 属 我 们 的 ， 就 必 仍 旧 与 我 们 同 在 。 他 们 出 去 ， 显 明 都 不 是 属 我 们 的 。 [kjv] They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. [bbe] They went out from us but they were not of us; if they had been of us they would still be with us: but they went out from us so that it might be made clear that they were not of us. 2:20 [hgb] 你 们 从 那 圣 者 受 了 恩 膏 ， 并 且 知 道 这 一 切 的 事 。 （ 或 作 都 有 知 识 ） [kjv] But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. [bbe] And you have the Spirit from the Holy One and you all have knowledge. 2:21 [hgb] 我 写 信 给 你 们 ， 不 是 因 你 们 不 知 道 真 理 ， 正 是 因 你 们 知 道 ， 并 且 知 道 没 有 虚 谎 是 从 真 理 出 来 的 。 [kjv] I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. [bbe] I have not sent you this letter because you have no knowledge of what is true, but because you have knowledge, and because that which is false has nothing in common with that which is true. 2:22 [hgb] 谁 是 说 谎 话 的 呢 ？ 不 是 那 不 认 耶 稣 为 基 督 的 吗 ？ 不 认 父 与 子 的 ， 这 就 是 敌 基 督 的 。 [kjv] Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. [bbe] Who is false but he who says that Jesus is not the Christ? He is the Antichrist who has no belief in the Father or the Son. 2:23 [hgb] 凡 不 认 子 的 就 没 有 父 。 认 子 的 连 父 也 有 了 。 [kjv] Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. [bbe] He who has no belief in the Son has not the Father: he who makes clear his belief in the Son has the Father. 2:24 [hgb] 论 到 你 们 ， 务 要 将 那 从 起 初 所 听 见 的 常 存 在 心 里 。 若 将 从 起 初 所 听 见 的 存 在 心 里 ， 你 们 就 必 住 在 子 里 面 ， 也 必 住 在 父 里 面 。 [kjv] Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. [bbe] But as for you, keep in your hearts the things which were made clear to you from the first. If you keep these things in your hearts you will be kept in the Father and the Son. 2:25 [hgb] 主 所 应 许 我 们 的 就 是 永 生 。 [kjv] And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. [bbe] And this is the hope which he gave you, even eternal life. 2:26 [hgb] 我 将 这 些 话 写 给 你 们 ， 是 指 着 那 引 诱 你 们 的 人 说 的 。 [kjv] These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. [bbe] I am writing these things to you about those whose purpose is that you may be turned out of the true way. 2:27 [hgb] 你 们 从 主 所 受 的 恩 膏 ， 常 存 在 你 们 心 里 ， 并 不 用 人 教 训 你 们 。 自 有 主 的 恩 膏 在 凡 事 上 教 训 你 们 。 这 恩 膏 是 真 的 ， 不 是 假 的 。 你 们 要 按 这 恩 膏 的 教 训 ， 住 在 主 里 面 。 [kjv] But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. [bbe] As for you, the Spirit which he gave you is still in you, and you have no need of any teacher; but as his Spirit gives you teaching about all things, and is true and not false, so keep your hearts in him, through the teaching which he has given you. 2:28 [hgb] 小 子 们 哪 ， 你 们 要 住 在 主 里 面 。 这 样 ， 他 若 显 现 ， 我 们 就 可 以 坦 然 无 惧 。 当 他 来 的 时 候 ， 在 他 面 前 也 不 至 于 惭 愧 。 [kjv] And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. [bbe] And now, my children, keep your hearts in him; so that at his revelation, we may have no fear or shame before him at his coming. 2:29 [hgb] 你 们 若 知 道 他 是 公 义 的 ， 就 知 道 凡 行 公 义 之 人 都 是 他 所 生 的 。 [kjv] If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him. [bbe] If you have knowledge that he is upright, it is clear to you that everyone who does righteousness is his offspring.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/192/2362.html","bookId":37,"book":{"id":37,"title":"约翰一书 1 John","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 论 到 从 起 初 原 有 的 生 命 之 道 ， 就 是 我 们 所 听 见 所 看 见 ， 亲 眼 看 过 ， 亲 手 摸 过 的 。 [kjv] That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with ou...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/192","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:23 AM"}}
