{"id":101486,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"The Inquisition had not been mean with the detainees. The hotel was a perfectly decent one and, while Igor was not in a deluxe accommodation, he had a suite with two good rooms. Anton hesitated for a second before he walked toward Igor. How he had changed... Igor had always been an operational agent. He\u0027d joined the Watch during the years after the war¡ªthere had been a lot of work to do then. On the one hand there was an upsurge of Light emotions, and on the other hand, during the difficult war years all sorts of petty riffraff had multiplied. And with the general atheistic mood in the country, it wasn\u0027t easy for anybody to accept that he or she was an Other. But it had been easy for Igor to accept his true nature; he had been glad to. He didn\u0027t really see much difference between parachuting in behind the fascist lines to blow up bridges and catching vampires and werewolves on the streets of Moscow. His Power was an honest third level, with little chance of advancing to anything higher, but even the third level is fairly substantial, if it\u0027s reinforced with experience, courage, and good reactions. Igor had all of those in abundance. Perhaps he was just a little bit short on experience, but then he had worked in the Watch at a time when you could easily count one year as three. Perhaps he wasn\u0027t as well-read or erudite as Ilya or Garik, and he hadn\u0027t taken part in as many impressive operations as Semyon, but there weren\u0027t many who could match him out in the field. And there was one other thing that Anton had always liked¡ªIgor had stayed young. Not just physically¡ªthat was no problem for a magician of his level¡ªbut in his soul. Who was it who would gladly accompany fifteen-year-old Yu-lia from the analytical department to some place in Tushino for the launch of the album \"A Hundred Fifty Billion Steps\" by the fashionable band Tequila Jazz? Who was it who was happy to spend time coping with a teenager riddled with complexes who\u0027d just realized he was an Other? Who would enthusiastically devote five years to extreme parachuting simply in order to verify the theory about the high numbers of Others involved in extreme sports? Who was always first to volunteer to take a colleague\u0027s watch or take on the most boring assignment (there was no lack of volunteers for the dangerous ones)? Maybe it was a mistake, but for some time already Anton had felt that it was safer to have your back covered by a partner who was reliable and cheerful, rather than powerful and worldly-wise. A powerful and wise partner could always be distracted by a more important job than covering someone else\u0027s back... But the Other standing in front of Anton now didn\u0027t look either powerful or cheerful. Igor had lost a lot of weight. There was a strange, dull, hopeless yearning in his eyes. And he didn\u0027t seem to know what to do with his hands... sometimes he put them behind his back, sometimes he clasped them together. \"Anton,\" he said after a long silence. Without a smile, with only the faintest trace of gladness. \"Hello, Anton.\" On a sudden impulse, Anton stepped forward and put his arms around Igor. He whispered: \"Hello... Now what are you doing in such a state...\" Witezslav, who was standing by the door, said quietly, \"I shan\u0027t issue any official warnings about associating with detainees... since you\u0027re Light Ones. Shall I wait for you, Gorodetsky?\" \"No, thank you,\" said Anton, stepping back from Igor, but leaving one hand on his shoulder. \"I\u0027ll make my own way back.\" \"Igor Teplov, the session of the Tribunal to consider your case will convene tomorrow evening, at seven o\u0027clock local time. A car will come for you at six thirty; be ready.\" \"I\u0027ve been ready for a long time,\" Igor said quietly. \"Don\u0027t worry.\" \"All the best,\" the vampire said politely as he went out. The two Light Ones were left alone together. \"Do I look damned awful?\" Igor asked. Anton didn\u0027t lie: \"Worse than that. I\u0027ve seen corpses that looked better. Anybody would think you were being kept on bread and water.\" Igor shook his head seriously. \"Oh no, I\u0027ve been kept in good conditions.\" There was a hint of irony in his words, as if he were talking about some animal sitting in a cage in a zoo. \"I\u0027ve got a parcel here for you,\" Anton replied in the same tone of voice, clutching at that weak thread of life. \"Is feeding the animals permitted?\" \"Yes, it is,\" Igor said with a nod. \"I just... I just can\u0027t eat, you know? I can\u0027t read books, I don\u0027t want to get drunk... or see anybody either. I switch on the television and watch it until three o\u0027clock in the morning. When I get up I switch it on again. You know, I\u0027ve already mastered the Czech language. It\u0027s very easy to understand.\" \"That\u0027s terrible,\" said Anton with a nod. \"All right. As you can understand, when I left I was given confidential instructions¡ª to give you back the will to live.\" Igor actually smiled at that. \"I understand. That\u0027s to be expected... well, get the things out.\" Anton put a thick pile of letters on the table. There was just one name on each envelope¡ªthe name of the person who had written the letter. \"These are from all our gang. Olga said you had to read her letter first. But Yulia and Lena said the same thing. So you choose for yourself...\" Igor looked at the letters thoughtfully and nodded. \"I\u0027ll throw a dice. All right, get out the rest. I don\u0027t mean the letters.\" Anton smiled as he took a bottle wrapped in paper out of a plastic bag. \"Smirnoff No. 21,\" said Igor. \"Right?\" \"Right.\" \"I knew it. Carry on.\" Anton carried on, smiling in embarrassment as he took out a small loaf of Borodinsky black bread, a stick of salami, salted cucumbers in a polythene vacuum pack, several purple Yalta onions, and a piece of pork fat. \"Why, you devils,\" said Igor, shaking his head. \"Everything the way I like it. Semyon advised you, did he?\" \"Yes.\" \"The customs officers must have thought you were insane.\" \"I made them look the other way. I\u0027m on official business¡ª so I have the right.\" \"I see. Okay, I\u0027ll just get everything ready. And you tell me what\u0027s been going on back there. I\u0027ve been kept informed... but it\u0027s better coming from you. About Andrei, about Tiger Cub... about that whole damn mess.\" While Igor was making the snacks, rinsing the glasses and drying them carefully, and opening the bottle, Anton told him in brief about the recent events in Moscow. Igor poured vodka into four glasses without speaking. He covered two with slices of bread, set one in front of Anton, and took the last one himself. \"For the guys,\" he said. \"May the Light show them compassion. For Tiger Cub... for Andriukha.\" They drank without clinking glasses, and Anton looked at Igor curiously. Igor began coughing and looked at his glass, perplexed. \"Anton... wait... this vodka\u0027s fake!\" \"Of course!\" Anton confirmed happily. \"Absolutely genuine fake vodka¡ªpure alcohol diluted with tap water. I chose it specially. You wouldn\u0027t believe how hard it is nowadays to buy fake vodka in the shops!\" \"But why?\" Igor exclaimed. \"What do you mean, why? Why did I bring you Borodinsky bread? I could have bought a loaf of fresh, tasty black bread in any shop in Prague! And the salami too, and the pork fat. The onions would have been the only problem...\" \"So this is a greeting from the motherland, is it?\" said Igor, still wincing. \"Precisely.\" \"Oh no... I want to greet my last morning without a headache,\" Igor said seriously. He frowned and passed his hand above the bottle and the two full glasses. The liquid glimmered a lemon-yellow color for a moment. Igor explained in a slightly guilty voice: \"I\u0027m allowed to use lower magic.\" \"Then pour another glass.\" \"Are you in some kind of a hurry?\" Igor asked, squinting at Anton as he poured the transformed vodka. \"No, where would I be going?\" Anton replied. \"I\u0027d rather sit here with you and have a chat. Do you know why I changed the bottle?\" \"So you\u0027re the perpetrator?\" \"Yes, it was me. Semyon brought the real thing. But I wanted to remind you that a beautiful bottle doesn\u0027t always contain good stuff.\" Igor sighed and his face went dark: \"Gorodetsky... don\u0027t moralize with me. I was in the Watch before you were even born. I understand everything. But it\u0027s my own fault, and I\u0027ll take my punishment.\" \"No, you don\u0027t understand a thing,\" Anton shouted angrily. \"You adopt this grand pose of yours: \u0027It\u0027s my fault, I\u0027ll take what\u0027s coming to me,\"\" he said, mimicking Igor. \"But what are we supposed to do? Especially now, without Tiger Cub and Andrei? You know that Gesar\u0027s decided to give the girls who do the programming intensive training?\" \"Oh, come on, Anton! There aren\u0027t any irreplaceable Others. The Moscow Watch has hundreds of magicians and enchantresses in its reserve!\" \"Yes, of course. And if we whistle, they\u0027ll come running. Leave their families, drop their jobs and their usual concerns. They\u0027ll take up arms, of course they will. If the active members of the Watch have disgraced themselves and given up...\" Igor sighed and began speaking abruptly and energetically, almost like the old operational agent: \"Anton, I understand all this. You\u0027re a bright guy, and you\u0027re doing the right thing now by making me angry. You\u0027re trying to inspire me with the will to live. You\u0027re trying to persuade me to fight... But understand one thing¡ªI really don\u0027t want to fight! I really think I am guilty. I really have decided to... withdraw. Into nothingness, into the Twilight.\" \"Why, Igor? I understand that anyone\u0027s death is always a tragedy, especially if it\u0027s your fault, but you couldn\u0027t have foreseen...\" Igor looked up at him with eyes full of pain and shook his head. \"No, Antoshka. It\u0027s you who doesn\u0027t understand a single thing. Do you think I\u0027m punishing myself because that kid drowned? No.\" Anton picked up his glass and drained it in a single gulp. \"I feel sorry for the boy,\" Igor went on. \"Very sorry. But I\u0027ve seen all sorts of things in my time... there have been times before when people died. And it was my fault. Children, women, old men. Have you ever, for instance, had to decide who to run to first, who to save¡ªan uninitiated Other or an ordinary person? I have. Have you ever had to draw all the Power from a crowd¡ªdrain it completely? Knowing there\u0027s a ninety percent probability two people in the crowd won\u0027t be able to bear it and they\u0027ll kill themselves? I have.\" \"I\u0027ve had to do a few things too, Igor.\" \"Yes, I understand. That hurricane... Then why are you talking such nonsense? Can\u0027t you believe it\u0027s not all about that unfortunate kid? That I fell in love with a Dark One?\" \"I can\u0027t,\" said Anton. \"I just can\u0027t! Gesar said that too, but...\" \"You\u0027d better believe Gesar,\" Igor said with a bitter smile. \"I love her, Anton. I still love her, even now. And I\u0027ll go on loving her¡ªthat\u0027s the real tragedy.\" He picked up his glass. \"Thanks at least for not setting a glass out for her on the table...\" Anton could feel the fury beginning to seethe inside him. \"Thanks...\" He broke off and followed Igor\u0027s glance to the glass-fronted cupboard, where there was a glass half-filled with vodka and covered with a stale piece of bread standing among the other glasses. \"You\u0027ve lost your mind,\" Anton muttered. \"Completely lost your mind! Remember, Igor¡ªshe\u0027s a witch!\" \"She was a witch,\" Igor agreed with a faint, sad smile. \"She provoked you... okay, she didn\u0027t enchant you, but she still made you fall in love with her.\" \"No. She fell in love herself. And she didn\u0027t have the slightest idea who I was.\" \"Okay. Let\u0027s accept that, you ought to know. But even so, it was provocation. By Zabulon, who knew everything that was happening...\" Igor nodded. \"Yes, very probably. I\u0027ve thought about that a lot, Anton. That fight in Butovo was obviously prepared well in advance by the Dark Ones. At the very highest level, just Zabulon and another one or two Dark Ones. Lemesheva probably knew. Edgar and the witches didn\u0027t.\" He didn\u0027t even think it worth mentioning the vampires and shape-shifters. \"Well, if you agree...\" Anton began. \"Wait. Yes, it was a deliberately planned operation. One of Zabulon\u0027s intrigues. And a successful one...\" Igor lowered his head. \"Only what difference does that make to the way I feel about Alisa?\" Anton felt like swearing angrily. So he did, and then he said, \"Igor, you\u0027ve looked at Alisa Donnikova\u0027s file. You must have looked at it!\" \"Yes.\" \"So you must understand how much blood she has on her hands! How much evil she has done? I\u0027ve clashed with her myself several times! She\u0027s been responsible for ruining our operations, she... she served Zabulon loyally...\" \"You forgot to add that she was Zabulon\u0027s broad,\" Igor said in a dull, lifeless voice. \"That the head of Moscow\u0027s Dark Ones enjoyed having sex with her in his Twilight form, that she took part in covens when there were human sacrifices and in group orgies. Why don\u0027t you say it? Say it, I know it all anyway. Gesar gave me the full file... he tried really hard. I know all that.\" \"And you still love her?\" Anton asked incredulously. Igor raised his head, and they looked into each other\u0027s eyes. Then Igor reached out and gently touched Anton\u0027s hand. \"Don\u0027t be angry with me, brother Light One. Don\u0027t despise me. And if you can\u0027t understand, you\u0027d better go. Take a walk around Prague...\" \"I\u0027m trying to understand,\" Anton whispered. \"Honestly, I\u0027m trying. Alisa Donnikova was a perfectly ordinary witch. No better and no worse than all the rest. A clever, beautiful, cruel witch. Who left evil and pain in her wake wherever she went. How can you love her?\" \"She was different with me,\" Igor replied. \"A nervous and unhappy girl who really wanted to love someone. Who had fallen in love for the first time. A girl who, unfortunately for us, the Dark Ones spotted before we did. And for her initiation they chose a moment when there was more Darkness in her soul than Light. That\u0027s not too difficult to do with teenage girls¡ªyou know yourself. And after that it was all very simple. The Twi-light drained all the goodness out of her. The Twilight turned her into what she became.\" \"It\u0027s not Alisa herself that you love,\" said Anton, failing to notice that he was speaking about Donnikova in the present tense. \"What you love is her idealized... no, her alternative image! The Alisa that never existed!\" \"She certainly doesn\u0027t exist now. But you\u0027re still wrong, Anton. I love her the way she became when she lost her powers as an Other. When she was freed for just a moment from that sticky gray cobweb. Tell me, have you never had to forgive somebody?\" \"Yes, I have,\" Anton replied after a pause. \"But not for something like that.\" \"You\u0027ve been lucky, Antoshka.\" Igor poured more vodka. \"Then tell me this...\" Anton wasn\u0027t trying to spare Igor\u0027s feelings, but he still found it hard to get the words out. \"Why did you kill her?\" \"Because she was a witch,\" Igor said very calmly. \"Because she caused evil and pain. Because \u0027a member of the Night Watch always protects people against Dark Ones everywhere, in any country, regardless of his personal attitude to the situation.\" Have you never wondered about why the Regulations include that specific phrase? About our personal attitude to the situation? It ought to read \u0027personal attitude to the Dark Ones,\" but that sounds rather pitiful. So they used a eum... euph...\" \"Euphemism,\" Anton prompted him. \"A euphemism.\" Igor laughed. \"Exactly. Remember when we caught the girl vampire on the roof? You were about to fire at her point-blank, but then your vampire neighbor turned up. And you lowered your gun.\" \"I was wrong,\" Anton said with a shrug. \"She had to be tried. That was why I stopped.\" \"No, Anton. You would have shot her. And any other vampire who came running to help the criminal. But you were facing a vampire who was your friend, or at least one that you knew. And you stopped. But imagine if the choice had been between shooting and letting the criminal escape.\" \"I would have shot her,\" Anton said abruptly. \"And Kostya too. There wouldn\u0027t have been any choice. I\u0027d have felt very bad about it, I agree, but I...\" \"And what if it hadn\u0027t just been someone you knew well, but the woman you loved? A human woman or an Other enchantress from either side?\" \"I would have shot...\" Anton whispered. \"I would have shot anyway.\" \"And then what?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t have allowed such a situation to arise. I just wouldn\u0027t have allowed it!\" \"Of course. The very idea of loving never enters our heads if we see the aura of Darkness. It\u0027s the same for the Dark Ones if they see the aura of Light. But we were caught by surprise, Anton. We\u0027d lost all our powers. And we didn\u0027t have a choice...\" \"Tell me, Igor...\" Anton paused and took a breath. The vodka hadn\u0027t done the trick, and even though the conversation was certainly intimate, it wasn\u0027t bringing any relief. \"Tell me, why didn\u0027t you just throw Alisa out of the camp? Why didn\u0027t you ask Gesar for help and advice? That way you would have protected people and at the same time...\" \"She wouldn\u0027t have gone,\" Igor said sharply. \"After all, she had legitimate reason to be there at Artek. You know what\u0027s the most terrible thing about this whole business, Anton? Zabulon extracted the right for her to restore herself from Gesar in exchange for the same right for a third-level magician! Me, that is! Do you see how everything was all tied up together?\" \"But are you sure she wouldn\u0027t have gone away?\" Anton asked. Igor lifted up his glass without speaking. For the first time that evening they clinked glasses, but no toast was proposed. \"No, Anton, I\u0027m not sure. That\u0027s the terrible thing, I\u0027m not sure. I told her... I ordered her to clear out. But that was the very first moment, when we\u0027d only just realized who was who. When my brain still hadn\u0027t kicked in, I was running on pure adrenaline...\" \"If she loved you,\" said Anton, \"she would have gone. You just needed to find the right words...\" \"Probably. But who can say for certain now?\" \"Igor, I\u0027m really sorry,\" Anton whispered. \"I don\u0027t feel sorry for the witch Alisa, of course... don\u0027t even ask me. I can\u0027t shed even a single tear for her. But I feel terribly sorry for you. And I really want you to stay with us. To get through this and not let it destroy you.\" \"I\u0027ve got nothing left to live for, Anton,\" said Igor with a guilty shrug. \"You understand, nothing! You know, I probably fell in love for the first time in my life too. I had a wife once. I became an Other in 1945... I came back from the front, a young captain with a chest full of medals, and not a single scratch on me... and I\u0027d been lucky in general. It was only later I realized it was my latent abilities as an Other that had kept me safe. And then I learned the truth about the Watches... It was a new war, you understand? And an absolutely just one, it couldn\u0027t have been more just. I didn\u0027t really know how to do anything except fight, and now I realized I\u0027d found myself a job for life. For a very long life. And that I wouldn\u0027t have to face any of those human afflictions and annoying illnesses, those lines for food... you can\u0027t even imagine what perfectly ordinary hunger is like, Anton, what genuinely black bread tastes like, or genuinely bad vodka... what it feels like the first time you laugh in the fat, well-fed face of a special agent from SMERSH and yawn lazily in response to his question: \"Why did you spend two months on enemy territory if the bridge was blown up on the third day after you parachuted in?\" Igor was beginning to get carried away now. He was speaking quickly and furiously... not at all the way the young magician from the Night Watch usually spoke... \"I came back and I looked at my Vilena, my little Lenochka-Vilenochka, so young and beautiful. She used to write me letters every day, honestly, and what letters they were! I saw how glad she was that I\u0027d come back¡ªI wasn\u0027t hurt, I wasn\u0027t crippled, and I was a hero as well. Very few women were so fortunate then. But she was very afraid that her envious bitches of neighbors would tell me about all the men she\u0027d had during those four years, that my officer\u0027s warrant wasn\u0027t the only reason she\u0027d been getting by quite comfortably... even now you don\u0027t understand half of what I\u0027m saying, do you? But I suddenly saw it. All of it at once. The longer I looked at her, the more I saw. All the details. And not only all her men¡ª from lousy speculators to others like me, soldiers who hopped over the hospital fence and went absent without leave... And the way she whispered to one colonel, \"He\u0027s probably been rotting in the ground for ages...\u0027¡ªI heard that too... And by the way, that colonel turned out to be a real man. He got up off the bed, slapped her across the face, got dressed, and walked out.\" Igor poured himself some vodka and drank it quickly, without waiting for Anton, then filled the glasses again. He said, \"That\u0027s when I became what I am. When I left my home, with my medals jangling and Vilena roaring, \"It\u0027s all lies what they told you, the bitches, I was faithful to you!\" I walked along the street, with something burning away in my soul. It was May, Anton. May 1945. Immediately after Germany capitulated, Gesar pulled me back from the front and told me: \"From now on your front line is here, Captain Teplov.\" And back then people were... they were different, Anton. Their faces were all shining! There were plenty of foul Dark creatures around, I won\u0027t deny it, but there was a lot of Light as well. And as I walked along the street the little kids darted round me, look-ing at my chest full of medals, arguing about which one was for what. Men shook my hand and invited me to take a drink with them. Girls came running up to me... and kissed me. Kissed me like their own boyfriends, who hadn\u0027t come back yet, or had already been killed. Like their own fathers, like their own brothers. Sometimes they cried, kissed me, and went on their way. Do you understand me? No, how could you... You worry about our country too, you think how bad everything is right now, what a lousy hole we\u0027re all in... You suffer because the Light Ones won\u0027t all get together to help Russia. Only you don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to be in a real hole, Anton. But we do!\" Igor drained his glass again. Anton raised his glass without speaking and nodded in support of the toast that had not been spoken aloud. \"That was when I became what I am,\" Igor repeated. \"A magician. A field agent. Eternally young. Who loves everybody... and nobody. I\u0027d already made up my mind that I would never fall in love. Never. Girlfriends were one thing, love was something quite different. I couldn\u0027t love a human being, because human beings were weak. I couldn\u0027t love an Other, because any Other was either an enemy or a comrade-in-arms. That was the principle I adopted for my life, Antoshka. And I stuck to it as closely as I could. It seemed like I was still the same young man who came back from the front, who still had plenty of time to think about falling in love. It\u0027s one thing to take a whirl with a girl on the dance floor...\" he said, and laughed quietly, \"or leap about in cool threads under the ultraviolet light at the discotheque... what difference does it make if it\u0027s jazz, rock, or trash, what length the skirt is and what the stockings are made of... It\u0027s all good. It\u0027s the way things ought to be. Have you seen that American cartoon, about Peter Pan? Well, I became like him. Only not a stupid little boy, but a stupid young man. And I felt just fine for a long time. Supposedly I\u0027ve outlived the time granted to a man, and it would be a sin to complain¡ªI haven\u0027t had any helpless old age or other problems. So don\u0027t you torment yourself unnecessarily, Anton.\" Anton sat there with his head in his hands, not speaking. It was as if he\u0027d opened a door and seen something behind it... not something taboo, and not something shameful either... Just something that had absolutely nothing to do with him. And he realized that behind every door, if¡ªmay the Light forbid!¡ªhe was able to open it, he would see something equally alien and... personal. \"I\u0027ve reached the end of my road, Anton,\" Igor said almost tenderly. \"Don\u0027t be so sad. I understand that you came here hoping to shake me up, to get all this nonsense out of my head, to carry out your instructions. Only it won\u0027t work. Like a fool, I really did fall in love with a Dark One. I killed her. And it turns out I killed myself too.\" Anton didn\u0027t say anything. It was all pointless. He was overwhelmed by someone else\u0027s anguish, someone else\u0027s grief. Instead of simply bringing a parcel to a sick friend, here he was sitting with him at his own wake... \"Anton, don\u0027t go away today,\" Igor said. \"I won\u0027t sleep anyway... soon I\u0027ll catch up on my sleep forever. To be honest, I\u0027ve got another three bottles of vodka in the refrigerator. And there\u0027s a restaurant five floors down.\" \"Then we\u0027ll fall asleep at the table.\" \"We\u0027ll be okay, we\u0027re Others. We can take it. I want to talk. To cry on someone\u0027s shoulder. I\u0027ve started feeling afraid of the dark. Can you believe that?\" \"Yes.\" Igor nodded. \"Thanks. I\u0027ve got my guitar here, we can sing something. Or I\u0027ll sing. You know, singing for yourself is just the same as... well, you understand. And apart from that...\" Anton looked at Igor¡ªhis voice had suddenly become more focused. Stronger. \"I\u0027m a watchman, after all. I haven\u0027t forgotten that, you can be quite sure. And it seems to me that in all this mess, I\u0027m no more than a pawn... no, probably not a pawn... A rook who has taken one of the other side\u0027s pieces and occupied a square in the line of fire. Only unlike the other pieces, I can think. I hope you haven\u0027t forgotten how to do that, either. I don\u0027t care about myself anymore, Anton. But I do care who wins this game. Let\u0027s think together.\" \"Where do we begin?\" Anton asked, feeling amazed at himself. Surely he hadn\u0027t accepted what Igor had said and agreed to think of him as a piece who had already been removed from the board... or who at least was already doomed as the invisible player reached out his hand for him... \"With Svetlana. With the Chalk of Destiny,\" said Igor, watching carefully to see how Anton\u0027s face changed. He laughed smugly. \"Well, have I guessed right? You\u0027ve been having the same thoughts?\" \"And so has Gesar...\" Anton whispered. \"Gesar\u0027s a clever one,\" Igor agreed. \"But we\u0027re no fools, are we? Anyway, why don\u0027t we try thinking with our heads and not our hands for once?\" \"Okay, let\u0027s try,\" Anton said with a nod. \"Only...\" He fumbled in his pocket for the amulet that Gesar had given him. He crushed the little ball in his hand and felt the bone needles prick his skin. There was never any gain without pain... He said: \"Now for twelve hours no one will be able to see us or hear us.\" \"Are you sure?\" Igor asked. \"Won\u0027t the absence of information alert the Inquisition?\" \"There won\u0027t be any absence,\" said Anton. \"As far as I understand it, if they have any observational devices here, or if they\u0027ve cast any tracking spells¡ªthey\u0027ll provide false information. It\u0027s a quality scam.\" \"Gesar\u0027s a clever one,\" Igor repeated with a smile. Edgar sat by the window, smoking and slowly sipping a glass of flat champagne. It still tasted good. His girlfriend was sleeping peacefully in the next room, satisfied and happy. She had turned out to be a fine girl. A German student with some Scandinavian blood, reasonably passionate and reasonably cheerful. But a bit too fanciful in sex for Edgar\u0027s taste. Unlike most of his colleagues, Edgar was very conservative in such matters. He didn\u0027t take part in orgies, he didn\u0027t have underage girlfriends, and out of all the possibilities he preferred the classic missionary position. But there was no denying that in that position he had achieved perfection. Edgar stretched sweetly and carefully opened the window. He stood up and breathed in the cold, frosty air. The new day had begun and perhaps the Tribunal would give its verdict that very evening. Then he\u0027d be able to relax and enjoy the festive season, without worrying about all these intrigues. But who was behind this intrigue, after all... the Day Watch or the Night Watch? And most important of all¡ªwhat role had been assigned to him? Could Yury\u0027s hint really be right, was he supposed to be sacrificed, just like Alisa? \"Here, look...\" Igor spread out a large sheet of paper on the table and took a pack of felt-tip pens out of his pocket. \"I\u0027ve already drawn a few diagrams... and some things fit together. This is Svetlana.\" Anton looked thoughtfully at the circle drawn with a thick yellow line and said, \"It doesn\u0027t look much like her.\" Igor laughed. \"All right... very witty. But look at the way things shape up. We and the Dark Ones had a balance, a precarious one, but still a balance... Here are the magicians with first- to third-level powers on our side... here are their equivalents on the Dark Side... Both the ones in active service and the others who can easily be mobilized.\" The paper was quickly covered with small circles. Then Igor divided the sheet in two with a sweeping gesture. At the top of one side he wrote \"Gesar,\" and at the top of the other, \"Zabu-lon.\" He explained: \"They\u0027re not really in the game. They\u0027re the players, but we\u0027re interested in the pieces. Look at how things changed with Svetlana\u0027s appearance.\" \"It depends what piece we decide she is,\" Anton said cautiously. \"Right now she\u0027s a first-level enchantress... or rather, she was.\" \"And what does that mean? Just look how many magicians there are at about the same level as her.\" \"She\u0027s a pawn,\" said Anton, feeling surprised at his own words. \"Svetlana\u0027s no more than a pawn for years and years to come! While she nurtures her Power, learns to control her abilities, acquires experience... She\u0027s more powerful than me... or she was. But I\u0027d have been able to handle her if I\u0027d been on the other side.\" \"Precisely, Anton,\" said Igor, deftly pouring himself a glass from the second bottle of vodka¡ªthe first was already standing empty under the table. \"Precisely! Svetlana made the Night Watch significantly more powerful. And in the future she could easily reach the same level as Gesar. But that\u0027s a matter of decades, or even hundreds of years.\" \"Then why all this activity by the Dark Ones? They almost violated the Treaty, simply in order to get Svetlana out of the game.\" \"Think,\" said Igor, glancing into Anton\u0027s eyes. \"Let\u0027s take the chess analogy all the way...\" \"A pawn that reaches the far side of the board...\" \"... becomes any other piece.\" Anton shrugged. \"Igor, that\u0027s obvious anyway. We\u0027re all pawns, but some of us have a chance to become queens. Svetlana has. You don\u0027t, I don\u0027t, Semyon doesn\u0027t... but it\u0027s a long way to the far edge of the board, and the Dark Ones don\u0027t need to be in such a hurry to eliminate Svetlana.\" \"The Chalk of Destiny,\" said Igor. \"What about it? Gesar wanted to use Egor, the boy without any destiny to make him into...\" \"Into what?\" Anton shrugged. \"A prophet, a philosopher, a poet, a magician... I don\u0027t know. Someone who would lead humanity toward the Light. Or perhaps a Mirror? Another Mirror, like Vi-taly Rogoza, only he would be on our side?\" \"But Svetlana didn\u0027t want to interfere,\" Igor said with a nod. \"The boy Egor was left with just his own destiny.\" \"But then...\" Anton began and stopped short. He didn\u0027t know if he had the right to tell Igor the truth he had discovered, even under the protection of the amulet. \"But then Olga rewrote someone\u0027s destiny with the other half of the Chalk,\" Igor said with a laugh. \"That\u0027s an open secret already. The important thing is that the operation was successful anyway. Svetlana didn\u0027t do it, but Olga did. And incidentally Gesar managed to have Olga rehabilitated.\" \"Incidentally?\" Anton queried, shaking his head. \"Okay, let\u0027s say incidentally... But that\u0027s the second layer of the truth. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a third layer too.\" \"The third layer is the person whose destiny Olga rewrote. As soon as Zabulon heard she\u0027d been rehabilitated, he realized he\u0027d been duped. Taken in by a simple diversionary maneuver. And the Dark Ones started looking. They checked poor Egor a dozen times¡ªin case the Book of Destiny had been rewritten twice for him...\" \"And how do you know that?\" \"I was keeping an eye on the boy. Gesar told me to¡ªit was obvious the Dark Ones would start looking for a trick.\" \"And?\" \"No, there were no tricks with Egor. It wasn\u0027t his destiny that was rewritten.\" \"Then whose was it?\" Igor looked into Anton\u0027s eyes without saying anything. As if he didn\u0027t have the right to say it himself. \"Svetlana\u0027s?\" Anton exclaimed in sudden realization. And he suddenly thought that in his place any Dark One would have squealed, \"Mine?\" \"It looks like it. A brilliant and elegant move. There was such an ocean of Power raging around her that it was impossible for anyone to notice what was being done with her Book of Destiny. And the Dark Ones can\u0027t check her Book of Destiny¡ªthat would be as good as a declaration of war.\" \"Gesar wants to accelerate Svetlana\u0027s transformation into a Great Enchantress?\" \"Out of the question. That\u0027s a violation of the Treaty. Dig a bit deeper.\" Anton looked at the circles on the paper. He took a felt-tip pen and drew a bright scarlet line upward from Svetlana, then another circle where it ended. An empty circle. \"Yes,\" said Igor. \"Precisely. You know what time this is now, don\u0027t you?\" \"The end of the millennium...\" \"Two thousand years since the birth of Jesus Christ;\" Igor said with a laugh. \"Ieshua was a supreme Light magician,\" said Anton. \"I don\u0027t even know if we can call him a magician... he was the Light itself... but... Gesar wants a second coming of the Messiah?\" \"You said it, not me,\" Igor replied. \"Let\u0027s drink... to the Light.\" Anton drank a full glass in total bewilderment. He shook his head. \"No, but this... Igor, this is playing with the pure powers. With the foundations of the universe! How could he take the risk?\" \"Anton, I\u0027m certain that\u0027s the way it was all planned. Judge for yourself¡ªthere\u0027s a boom in religious faiths everywhere, one way or another everybody\u0027s expecting either the end of the world or the Second Coming... but then, they\u0027re the same thing.\" \"Not everybody...\" Anton protested. \"Don\u0027t exaggerate.\" \"Not everybody, but enough people for the torrent of human expectations to start reshaping reality. And if you could just help things along a bit, if you could rewrite someone\u0027s destiny... Gesar went for broke. Gesar wants to add someone new to our ranks, an Other so powerful that none of the Dark Ones will be able to match him. Not Zabulon, not a certain modest California farmer, not the owner of a small hotel in Spain, and not a popular Japanese singer... no one.\" \"That might be true,\" Anton admitted. \"But Svetlana\u0027s lost her Power now, and for a long time.\" \"And what of it? Does that prevent her from having a child?\" \"Stop,\" said Anton, waving his hands in warning. \"Now we\u0027re getting ahead of ourselves! We can believe any hypothesis, but first let\u0027s look at the other events. The Mirror, for instance.\" \"The Mirror...\" Igor frowned. \"A Mirror is created by the Twilight. Zabulon couldn\u0027t make use of him directly... but he certainly could bring those stupid sect members to Moscow with that artifact of theirs and feed Rogoza with Power. And the reason for doing that is obvious¡ªto destroy Svetlana.\" \"Rogoza didn\u0027t destroy her. He only drained her, but then that\u0027s...\" \"One of us didn\u0027t play the game the way Zabulon had planned it,\" Igor replied. \"Someone didn\u0027t make the move that would have led to the Mirror totally destroying Svetlana... as an individual. Maybe what saved her was the fact that Tiger Cub and Andrei had already died? A Mirror isn\u0027t exactly a Dark Other, and he isn\u0027t directly involved in the confrontation between the two Watches. You see, maybe he was expecting another blow of some kind? From you, for instance. From Gesar. But the blow never came... and he didn\u0027t strike back with all his strength.\" \"Then explain to me, Igor¡ªwhy did Zabulon set you and Alisa up?\" \"That was an accident,\" Igor muttered. \"I told you, Alisa...\" \"Okay, so she didn\u0027t know. But Zabulon knew, believe me! And he sent her to her death¡ªhe swapped one piece for another. Why?\" \"I wish I knew,\" said Igor with a shrug.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/day-watch-watch-2/page-18.html","bookId":2624,"book":{"id":2624,"title":"Day Watch (Watch #2)","description":"Storyline: Day Watch (Watch, #2) Day Watch (Russian: Dnevnoi Dozor, Дневной дозор) is a fantasy novel by Russian authors Sergey Lukyanenko and Vladimir Vasilyev. The second book in the tetralogy of Watches, it is preceded by Night Watch and followed by Twilight Watch and Last Watch. Day Watch also stands out of the tetralogy as it is the only novel in the series not told from Anton Gorodetsky\u0027s point of view. While the 2006 film Day Watch bears the same name as this book, it is actually a loose adaptation of the latter parts of the first book, Night Watch, and not an adaptation of this novel.
