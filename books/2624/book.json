{"id":2624,"title":"Day Watch (Watch #2)","description":"Storyline: Day Watch (Watch, #2) Day Watch (Russian: Dnevnoi Dozor, Дневной дозор) is a fantasy novel by Russian authors Sergey Lukyanenko and Vladimir Vasilyev. The second book in the tetralogy of Watches, it is preceded by Night Watch and followed by Twilight Watch and Last Watch. Day Watch also stands out of the tetralogy as it is the only novel in the series not told from Anton Gorodetsky\u0027s point of view. While the 2006 film Day Watch bears the same name as this book, it is actually a loose adaptation of the latter parts of the first book, Night Watch, and not an adaptation of this novel. The English translation by Andrew Bromfield was released in January 2007 both in the US and UK.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/day-watch-watch-2.jpg","author":"Sergei Lukyanenko","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":20,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
