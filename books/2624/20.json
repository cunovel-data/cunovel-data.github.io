{"id":101488,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"By midday Anton had given up. He and Igor hadn\u0027t drunk any more vodka, despite its remarkable ability to stimulate the imagination. Coffee already made him feel sick. And he didn\u0027t feel like drinking any of the wonderful Czech beer either. Igor was standing by the window with a glass of Dannon drinking yogurt in his hand. He shook his head at Anton\u0027s latest suggestion. \"No, come on. What sort of dragonslayer would I make? And I thought we\u0027d abandoned the Fafnir scenario?\" \"But what if it\u0027s right after all?\" \"It makes no difference. It\u0027s a battle of magic, not a duel with a fire-breathing dragon...\" Igor chuckled and added cynically. \"And anyway, in a fight between Fafnir the Dragon and a pair of modern battle helicopters, I\u0027d put my money on the choppers. There\u0027s no point in any more guessing, Anton. We won\u0027t come up with anything.\" \"But even so, Igor, you\u0027re the key.\" \"But what can we do about it? Nobody ever tells keys which doors they\u0027re going to open. Anton, I\u0027m a perfectly ordinary Other. Only Zabulon knows what makes me so important. And Gesar probably knows too. He\u0027ll come upstairs and join us in a moment, then we can ask him.\" Anton looked through the Twilight and said enviously: \"Seriously? Is he already close? I can\u0027t sense him...\" \"I can\u0027t sense him either: I just saw them through the window, walking into the hotel.\" There was a gentle tap at the door. Just a token gesture of politeness, no more than that, and a moment later the visitors entered through the Twilight. Gesar, his silent shadow Alisher, and Svetlana. Svetlana was led through the Twilight by the magicians, and she only saw Anton when all three of them emerged from the Twilight into the human world. She smiled and gave a slightly guilty shrug, as if to say: \"Just look what I\u0027m like now.\" Once again Anton was overcome by a miserable feeling of guilt and tenderness, mixed with shame and anger at himself. Even though he\u0027d had no other option but to let the Mirror take away all of Svetlana\u0027s Power... And the most important thing was that as a result, Svetlana was still alive... But he couldn\u0027t rid himself of the cursed feeling that the game had been lost. Could Igor really have similar feelings when he remembered Alisa? Similar, but far more bitter? In that case Anton could only be surprised and delighted that he was still alive. \"Good afternoon, lads...\" Gesar said in a soft voice. He was wearing a modest, inexpensive suit and plain tie, looking like a run-of-the-mill businessman who bought his clothes from Marks and Spencer and always sent his employees modest presents for Christmas. In this case, of course, Gesar regarded himself as the very best present... \"Hello, Boris Ignatievich,\" said Anton. He couldn\u0027t bring himself to call this afternoon good. \"Hello, Alisher.\" He and Sveta simply exchanged glances again and he took her by the hand and led her across to a chair, as if she were an invalid... It was awful. \"Good afternoon, boss,\" Igor said calmly. \"I\u0027m glad to see you. Hello, Sveta. Hi, Alisher.\" Gesar\u0027s bodyguard (that is, of course, if it was really possible to regard a third-level magician as a bodyguard for a Great Magician)¡ªor, perhaps more accurately, his orderly, the son of a devona and a human woman¡ªAlisher nodded to the magicians without speaking and moved into the corner of the room, where he froze with his arms crossed on his chest and partially withdrew into the Twilight. Anton sensed that Alisher\u0027s ability to observe in the Twilight had been heightened artificially, clearly by the boss. And he also noticed that the young magician was trying not to look at Igor. That was another crazy tangle¡ªAlisher\u0027s father had been killed by Alisa Donnikova. And even though he hadn\u0027t been a human being or an Other... it was hard to formulate the precise status of a devona, a faithful helper of the Great Magicians. The devona himself did not perform any great feats of heroism, that was not his job. He merely served the heroes, removed minor obstacles from their path. And he strengthened family ties, facilitating the birth of great heroes... Anton caught his breath. As a rule, werewolves\u0027 children inherited the ability to transform, while magicians\u0027 children only became Others very rarely. But how did it work with devonasl Who was Alisher: simply a magician or a devona like his father, who had been Gesar\u0027s assistant in Central Asia for many centuries? And what did the boss need the young Uzbeki magician for? Was it only for sentimental reasons that Gesar had taken him into the Moscow Watch and made him his retainer? \"Anton!\" He looked at Svetlana and only then realized that he was squeezing her hand too hard. \"Sorry...\" Gesar was standing in front of Igor, looking into his eyes. He looked for a long time without saying anything. Then he sighed and walked away to a chair, hunched over and looking limp. He sat down and lowered his face into his hands. \"Boris Ignatievich,\" said Igor, \"forgive me.\" \"No!\" Gesar barked, with his hands still over his face, \"I won\u0027t forgive you! So what if you fell in love with a witch? I won\u0027t condemn you for that¡ªthat\u0027s destiny. But you\u0027ve given up on yourself¡ªdon\u0027t expect any forgiveness for that!\" Igor was clearly uncomfortable. As Anton looked at him, he suddenly realized he\u0027d accomplished his mission after all. Not by simple, head-on tactics¡ªit would have been stupid to expect to trick an experienced magician and restore his will to live with a simple drinking session and conversations about his friends. It would have been even more stupid to hope to convince him that the woman he loved was simply a repulsive, greedy bitch. But their long nocturnal conversation, their attempts to understand what was happening and make sense of the latest stage in the war between the Watches had had an effect. Igor had been distracted from his misery and suffering. He had felt he was part of a team again. Could that have been what Gesar was counting on? In that case, all of his behavior, including the present scene, had been carefully calculated! But after all, the boss was right, Igor\u0027s mind was simply clouded. \"Gesar, there are things that even you have no right to ask!\" Igor suddenly said. He said it abruptly, with a reawakened fury. With life in his voice. \"Yes, of course, Captain Igor Teplov.\" Gesar\u0027s voice was as cold as ice. \"I have no right. But who had the right to ask you to swim down the Dnieper under fire in November \u002742? And who had the right...\" \"That\u0027s different.\" \"Why is it?\" Gesar stood up, walked over to Igor and stopped still in front of him again, a head shorter than Igor, small and wiry, not looking at all heroic. \"Do I have to explain to you, Teplov, what a war requires? It\u0027s not bodies that a war devours, but souls! And you knew that in the glorious city of Berlin, when you used your knife on that poor snot-nosed kid from the Hitler Jugend to make him give his friends away¡ªyou knew that.\" Igor started as if he\u0027d been slapped across the face. \"Conscience... love... honor...\" Gesar said thoughtfully. \"No one has the right to make anyone go against their conscience. No one has the right to make anyone betray love. No one has the right to persuade anyone to betray their honor. No one. You\u0027re right. But we do it! Of our own accord. When one pan of the scales holds our love, conscience, and honor, and the other holds a million loving, decent, honorable people. We\u0027re no angels, that\u0027s not for us. And I understand your pain, believe me! But you take a look at Alisher! And try to understand his pain! Ask Anton what he thinks about the one you love. Ask Svetlana.\" \"I can\u0027t condemn Igor,\" Svetlana said quietly. \"I\u0027m sorry, boss. Forgive me, Alisher. Maybe I\u0027m just a fool... unworthy to work in the Watch. But I can understand all of you.\" She said this in a very low voice, without any emphasis, but Gesar stopped talking and moved away from Igor. He spread his hands and asked, \"Do you think I don\u0027t understand?\" The silence in the room was thick and heavy. \"Gesar, when it was my duty, I carried out my orders,\" Igor suddenly said. \"Honestly, right down the line. Regardless of... what I thought or felt. But my duty\u0027s done now. I\u0027ve reached the end of the line.\" \"No. That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong, Igor.\" Gesar started walking round the room and took a cigar out of his pocket. He looked at it and frowned, put it back and took out a pack of democratic Pall Malls. He crumpled that and gestured in annoyance. \"The Watch needs you. We all need you. I need you.\" \"Svetlana needs me...\" Igor remarked casually. \"Svetlana, Alisher, Ilya, Semyon, Bear¡ªall of us!\" Gesar said very quickly. \"Of course!\" Igor smiled, as if reconciling himself to the fact that he couldn\u0027t finish what he wanted to say. And then he suddenly asked in a businesslike, serious voice, \"For long?\" \"Twenty years at most,\" Gesar said quite calmly, as if he\u0027d been expecting this question. \"Gesar, do you hope that will be long enough for me to stop loving Alisa?\" \"That too,\" Gesar admitted. \"But the Watch needs you right now. In the years immediately ahead.\" \"What do you want me to do, Gesar?\" \"Don\u0027t get in our way, Igor. We\u0027re going to try to get you out of this. And we will get you out of it, believe me, if you just don\u0027t get in our way... or even better, if you help us just a little bit.\" Igor thought about it. Then he said, \"I won\u0027t accuse Alisa Donnikova of enchanting me. It\u0027s not true.\" \"But you can express the suspicion that your meeting was set up by the Moscow Day Watch?\" \"Yes, I can,\" Igor said with a nod. \"That\u0027s probably the way it was.\" \"That\u0027s enough,\" said Gesar with a shrug. \"I don\u0027t ask anything else of you.\" And he really did look satisfied with that. Anton cleared his throat and waited for Gesar to look at him. Then he said, \"Boris Ignatievich, I\u0027d like to ask you to do something for me. Can you explain what role Igor plays in our latest plot?\" \"Just Igor?\" \"Yes. What you need Svetlana for, and the devona Alisher, is clear enough already.\" The young Uzbeki magician standing stock still in the corner started. \"The new generation\u0027s coming along well...\" Gesar said in a tired voice. \"Shrewd. But stupid at the same time...\" He hesitated and looked around at everyone there. Then he shook his head, and Anton sensed the Power spreading around them and flooding the room. The elastic wall was pressing something back, squeezing it out... \"I can\u0027t tell you,\" Gesar admitted unexpectedly. \"I can\u0027t tell you for one simple reason...\" \"We\u0027d refuse to cooperate?\" Anton asked sharply. Gesar shook his head. \"No. On the contrary. I swear on the Light that what is going on will cause no harm to any of you. Neither to your magical or your human being... In fact, you would cooperate with genuine, sincere zeal. But...\" He was weighing every word now. \"What is taking place now really is the final operation of the Moscow Night Watch. Unfortunately, it is also the final operation of the Day Watch. Too much depends on the actions taken by everyone sitting here, as well as on the actions taken by our en-emies. We are making our moves and our enemies are making theirs. They could be wrong, unsuccessful, mistaken. But the victory will go to those who make the final correct move.\" \"The victors are never judged,\" Anton agreed. \"And the pieces on a chessboard are not given the right to move independently.\" \"Zabulon will easily read any move that any of you make!\" Gesar barked. \"And don\u0027t imagine, Anton, that when you rammed the Mirror\u0027s car it was a move that hadn\u0027t been foreseen! Yes, it was a successful move, the lesser of two evils. But even that was anticipated. By Zabulon... and by me.\" He paused for breath and went on more calmly: \"Folks... to me you are not just pieces on a chessboard. Believe me. You\u0027re more than just tools.\" \"But one of us,\" said Svetlana with a smile acknowledging that she was the only woman in the room, \"is the lathe for producing a tool?\" Anton didn\u0027t ask how she had realized. Maybe she\u0027d been drawing up diagrams too¡ªwithout letting even him know? Or maybe she\u0027d already sensed something when she still had her powers? Gesar paused, lowering his head. He seemed to be thinking hard... And then Anton realized that the strength of the protective cocoon around them had increased to a quite incredible level. Where was the limit to the Power of the Great Magicians? Was there even a limit to it at all? \"All right,\" Gesar said with a nod. \"Svetlana, you\u0027re right... but only partly... ah, Light and Darkness!\" He lowered himself into an armchair, took out the cigarettes again, and lit one. He took two drags and started speaking: \"Svetlana, you are a Great Enchantress. They\u0027re only born every few centuries. Potentially, you\u0027re more powerful than Olga... probably... But your value to the Light Ones¡ªand I don\u0027t mean just our Watch, but Light Ones in general¡ªis that you can become the mother of the Messiah.\" \"After Olga rewrote my Book of Destiny,\" Svetlana said. \"No. Not after that. It\u0027s not possible to rewrite the destiny of an Other as easily as the destiny of a human being. It was predetermined from the very beginning. We only corrected a few details. Minor ones. That don\u0027t affect you or the future... the prospective child.\" \"What details?\" The anger could suddenly be heard in Svet-lana\u0027s voice, the anger she\u0027d restrained for so long. Now it was Anton who wanted to shout out as her fingers dug into the palm of his hand. \"Only the date.\" Gesar had no intention of giving way to pressure from Svetlana. \"Nothing but the date. Two thousand years after the birth of Christ is the peak of human belief in the coming of the Messiah.\" \"Thank you very much,\" said Svetlana in a voice trembling with fury. \"So you decided when I would have him and who his father would be?\" \"In the first place, why \u0027him\u0027?\" Gesar asked. Anton had been on the point of putting in a few words, mostly to clarify what Svetlana had said about the father, but he choked on this swift rejoinder. Svetlana\u0027s hand went limp too. \"For some the father and mother decide, for some it\u0027s the drunken obstetrician, for others it\u0027s an extra glass of vodka,\" Gesar said in a melancholy voice. There was no need for him to say \"in the second place.\" \"Svetlana, my child! It\u0027s dangerous to play with such forces, with such predetermination. Even I\u0027m not trying to do that. It is predetermined that you can give birth to a daughter who will become the greatest figure in the war between the Light and the Darkness. Her word will change the entire world. Her word will make sinners repent. At a glance from her the greatest magicians of Darkness will go down on their knees.\" \"It\u0027s only a probability...\" Svetlana whispered. \"Of course. There is no fate¡ªwhich is both unfortunate and fortunate. But you must believe that an old, weary magician is doing everything he can to make it a reality.\" \"I should have stayed a human being...\" Svetlana whispered. \"I should have...\" \"Have you looked at any icons recently?\" Gesar asked. \"Look into Mary\u0027s eyes and think why they\u0027re always so sad.\" The room was very quiet. \"I\u0027ve already told you more than I have any right to.\" Gesar spread his arms in a guilty shrug, and for the first time ever it seemed to Anton that he wasn\u0027t acting at all. \"But I have told you, I\u0027ve put one foot over the line of what is permissible. It\u0027s up to you to decide. To think who is a figure on a chessboard, and who is a rational individual, capable of seeing past imaginary offenses.\" \"Imaginary?\" Svetlana asked bitterly. \"When they explained that you had to wash your hands after playing in the sandpit or made you tie the ribbon on your braid in a bow¡ªthat was interference in your destiny too,\" said Gesar. \"And I think it was justified.\" \"You\u0027re not my father, Boris Ignatievich!\" said Svetlana. \"No, of course not. But to me, you\u0027re all my children...\" Gesar sighed. \"I\u0027ll wait for you in the hall... that is, Alisher and I will wait. Join us if you want to.\" He went out, and the devona followed him like a shadow. Igor was the first to say anything. \"What hurts most is that he\u0027s right about some things.\" \"If you\u0027d been told that you have to give birth to a Messiah, then I\u0027d talk to you about what\u0027s right or wrong,\" Svetlana replied abruptly. \"That would be rather, well... difficult for me,\" Igor admitted in an embarrassed voice. Anton was the first to smile. He looked at Svetlana and said, \"Listen... I remember how indignant you were about the injustice of destiny¡ªthat generally speaking, Others only have children who are ordinary people...\" \"That was just an abstract indignation...\" said Svetlana, throwing her hands up in the air. \"Boys, I think someone\u0027s already been smoking in here...\" Igor handed her a cigarette without speaking. \"Why do everything like that, behind our backs,\" Svetlana complained as she lit her cigarette. \"And what sort of mother would I make... for a Messiah? And a female one at that!\" \"Well, Messiah is just the appropriate term, that\u0027s all,\" said Igor. \"Relax.\" \"I\u0027m no virgin!\" Svetlana declared gloomily. \"And in general... I don\u0027t think of myself as a paragon of virtue...\" \"Don\u0027t draw irrelevant parallels.\" Strangely enough, Igor seemed to have calmed down. For real. He was sharp and focused. \"Anton, why don\u0027t you say something!\" Svetlana burst out. \"Doesn\u0027t all this concern you at all?\" \"I very much hope that it concerns me directly,\" replied Anton. \"And I think we ought to go out now and join Gesar. It\u0027s tough on him sitting out there and waiting.\" \"He already knows everything... in advance...\" Svetlana said and turned away. \"No. He doesn\u0027t. If we\u0027re really not pawns, he doesn\u0027t know.\" There was the soft sound of guitar strings. Igor was leaning against the wall, holding the instrument. He began singing so softly that Svetlana and Anton both had to stop talking. The devils ask me to serve, But I serve no one. Even myself, even you, Even the one who has power. If he is still alive, I do not serve even him. I have stolen just enough fire Not to need to steal any more... Igor held the guitar out and gently lowered it into an armchair. People put their instrument down like that when they\u0027re sure they\u0027ll be back soon. \"Shall we go then?\" Edgar was the first Dark One to enter the Tribunal\u0027s meeting hall. That was the procedure. He entered through one door at the same time as Anton came in through the door opposite. They bowed their heads to each other in a polite greeting. Edgar did not feel any particular resentment for the Light One and he expected the feeling to be mutual to some extent. Yes, compared to the small, neglected room in Moscow University, this hall certainly made an impression. This was Europe, after all. Stone vaulting¡ªheavy and oppressive, but at the same time giving a sense of security and calm. A simple metal chandelier, but with about two hundred candles, and Edgar could have sworn the candles had been burning for more than one century already. They said the Berne department of the Inquisition was located in an ultramodern building, but the Prague department was in a truly ancient one. Edgar liked the old style better. The round hall was divided into two parts: One was faced with light marble, the other with dark. There was something at once naive and exalted in this simple visual representation of the two Powers. The little desks for the prosecutors stood at the center, beside a circular metal grille covering a dark hole in the floor. A wedge of gray marble reached almost to the very center of the hall. That was the Inquisitors\u0027 area, and they, of course, were already in their seats. Seven of them. In principle the Inquisition was not regarded as a power equal to the two Watches, but Edgar knew that those seven included two Great Ones¡ªone Dark and one Light. If it wished, the European office could probably fight Gesar and Zabulon on equal terms. That was good to know. Anton was followed in by three Light Ones from Moscow. Gesar... well, of course, where would they be without Gesar! Svetlana... that was natural too. And that Uzbeki, Gesar\u0027s secretary or personal assistant. The Dark Ones were already walking along the corridor behind Edgar. Zabulon... Sensing the approach of his chief, Edgar involuntarily looked round¡ªand received a friendly nod from the head of Moscow\u0027s Dark Ones. Well, well... smile, you Judas ... you\u0027re even worse than Judas: He betrayed his teacher, but you\u0027re betraying your disciple! But then another two Dark Ones followed Zabulon into the hall. Edgar had been prepared to see Anna Lemesheva, but not Yury, who winked mockingly at him. The same Yury who had given Edgar the timely warning about Zabulon\u0027s underhand schemes¡ªhe hadn\u0027t been prepared for that! Edgar forced himself to turn away from his colleagues and look straight ahead. Igor was brought in last. Two rank-and-file Inquisitors walked in beside him and accompanied him to the circular grille, three meters across, in the center of the hall. There was no special magic in that circle, or at least Edgar couldn\u0027t sense any. And the mechanism that had once been used to invert the grille and plunge the accused into a deep well shaft looked as if it had rusted up long ago and was no longer used. But even so it didn\u0027t look as if standing on that circle was pleasant. However, Igor paid no attention to that and stood in the center of the circle with his arms crossed on his chest. \"In the name of the Treaty...\" One Inquisitor came forward from the group. The only one who was not wearing gray robes. Witezslav, the Higher Vampire. \"We are Others. We serve different Powers...\" Edgar mechanically repeated the words of the Treaty, trying to work out what Witezslav would start with. And how he could extricate himself from this mess now. \"Today the European Tribunal of the Inquisition has to consider a claim brought by the Night Watch of the city of Moscow, Russia, against the Day Watch of the city of Moscow, Russia,\" the vampire announced after the reading of the Treaty. \"A counterclaim by the Day Watch of Moscow against the Night Watch of Moscow forms part of the proceedings. Its subject is the duel between the Light magician Igor Teplov, and the Dark witch Alisa Donnikova...\" There were no surprises so far... Edgar felt himself clutching the dark, cool wooden top of his desk and made an effort of will to calm himself down. After all, he was an experienced lawyer. And how were legal proceedings between people any different from legal proceeding between Others? Except, of course for the nature of the sentence... \"However, the sequence of proceedings will be changed somewhat,\" said Witezslav. \"The Tribunal is also obliged to resolve another two matters connected with the main claim. The first concerns a sect of Dark Ones who call themselves the Regin Brothers, who are guilty of attacking the Inquisition\u0027s vault and stealing the artifact known as Fafnir\u0027s Talon, smuggling it into Russia, and resisting the Night Watch of Moscow. Bring in the accused.\" Another two young Inquisitors led in the four Finns. Faint smiles appeared on the faces of all the Others present¡ªafter all, it was impossible to imagine a more ludicrous-looking quartet. \"There is probably no need to recite the circumstances of the incident,\" said the vampire. \"Everyone present is familiar with the materials collected by the Inquisition on this case. The Inquisition\u0027s job is to pronounce judgment. Just, impartial, and strict.\" It was clear from the expressions on the faces of the four accused that they were not anticipating leniency. \"The punishment for a crime as grave as attacking employees of the Inquisition and stealing a highly dangerous artifact from the vault is unconditional¡ªdematerialization,\" the vampire declared. He paused and then added something that made the Finns lift up their heads: \"But... But the accused did not participate directly in the incident in Berne. As the materials of the case make clear, the leaders of the sect, who unfortunately were killed while being detained, made the four young magicians act as couriers. Therefore, the Inquisition qualifies their actions only as smuggling and resisting the Night Watch of Moscow. There are also extenuating circumstances: profound and sincere remorse, assistance rendered to the investigation after detention, the youth of the accused, and the absence of any previous offenses. If the Night Watch of Moscow can adduce any further extenuating circumstances and will withdraw the personal accusations against the Dark magicians, the Inquisition has the right to mitigate its sentence.\" Gesar stood up to speak for the Light Ones. He spread his hands in a broad gesture. \"The Night Watch of Moscow has no... personal charges to bring against the accused. In addition, we believe that the leadership of the sect of the Regin Brothers was provoked into committing its crime by a certain... a certain unidentified Dark magician.\" \"That has not been proved,\" said Witezslav. \"Only the identity of the provocateur has not been established,\" Gesar said with a smile. \"The fact of his existence is in no doubt.\" Witezslav nodded and turned to face his six colleagues. For a few moments the Inquisitors shared their thoughts with each other without speaking. Then Witezslav looked back to the four motionless Finns. \"In the name of the Treaty, bearing in mind the clement attitude of the Night Watch, the absence of any grave consequences, and the other extenuating circumstances, the Inquisition offers you the right to choose your punishment. The first option¡ªyou are condemned to death by hanging but your civil rights will not be affected...\" The large young black man sighed heavily and the Chinese and the Finn grabbed his elbows and held him up. \"The second possible punishment is that from this day until the end of your lives you will be forbidden to use magic. You will have the right to live ordinary human lives, without using magical means to prolong or improve the quality of those lives.\" The Finns looked at the Inquisitor, stunned. Zabulon giggled shrilly, but immediately assumed a serious expression. \"The second... the second!\" Yukha Mustajoki said in a choking voice. The others nodded. \"Does anyone present have any objections?\" Witezslav asked. Gesar got to his feet again. \"As a small gesture of goodwill... we consider it possible to permit the accused to use magic... minor magic... with inanimate objects.\" It seemed as if Gesar had to struggle to pronounce every word, that he was forcing himself to show mercy. \"Say, to find some... small item... that\u0027s been lost... a key or a coin... To drive the flies out of a room... according to the regulations, flies are regarded as inanimate, are they not? To clean the carburetor in a car...\" The vampire\u0027s face expressed faint surprise. He doesn\u0027t understand, Edgar thought. \"The Inquisition has no objections...\" the vampire said eventually. \"Apply the seals to the accused!\" Two Inquisitors raised their right hands, and fine threads of glimmering energy streamed through the air toward the accused. The seals were applied permanently, leaving the condemned prisoners capable of only the very weakest forms of magic. Probably the Inquisitors really hadn\u0027t understood that Gesar\u0027s unexpected kindness had only made the punishment worse. It was one thing to be completely deprived of all magic and gradually come to terms with life as a human being. It was quite different to feel every day that you were a helpless cripple who had to manage with a pale shadow of your former abilities. But then, the Finns hadn\u0027t thought about that yet. They were led out of the hall, absolutely crazy with happiness. Yukha kept trying to break away and shake everybody\u0027s hand, but the vigilant guards forced him to walk out simply by nudging and shoving him. Edgar shook his head. He actually felt quite glad that the Dark Brothers had been saved. But what a price to pay... He would probably have preferred a quick death. \"The next matter for this hearing to consider has not been announced in advance,\" said Witezslav. \"The Inquisition requests the leader of the Night Watch of Moscow, known under the name of Gesar, to step into the circle of the accused...\" Zabulon smiled in triumph. \"And also the leader of the Day Watch of Moscow, known under the name of Zabulon.\" Edgar was delighted by Zabulon\u0027s slightly perplexed expression. But just how genuine was it? \"The Inquisition\u0027s first question is for the Great Magician Gesar.\" Witezslav was speaking politely now, but very firmly. \"Gesar, have you carried out interventions in the Book of Destiny of the Great Enchantress Svetlana Nazarova, here present, with the intention of compelling the said Great Enchantress to become the mother of a Light Messiah?\" The hall fell silent. \"Rephrase your question, Witezslav,\" Gesar said in a soft voice. \"Or I shall take offense.\" The vampire bared his teeth in a smile. \"Answer the substance of the point, Great Magician Gesar.\" \"Very well,\" said Gesar with a nod. \"I was not expecting these accusations, but... I will explain for the Tribunal.\" You were expecting them, thought Edgar. You were expecting everything, you cunning old schemer... \"An intervention of that kind is impossible in principle. Even for me,\" Gesar declared modestly. Witezslav seemed confused by that. \"But, Great Magician Gesar, Svetlana Nazarova\u0027s Book of Destiny...\" \"Shows that she will become the mother of the greatest of all Light enchantresses; in poetical terms a Light Messiah.\" Gesar smiled happily. \"This is a great joy for the Night Watch of Moscow... and, indeed, for all Light Ones! But the respected Inquisition must understand that such things cannot be written into a Book of Destiny. Absolutely not. There is no way. Not even by using a certain artifact familiar to you which belongs by right to the Night Watch.\" \"But interventions were made in Svetlana Nazarova\u0027s Book of Destiny?\" the vampire continued to insist. \"Yes,\" Gesar said, and nodded. \"As everybody, or almost everybody, knows, it is possible to make a new entry in a Book of Destiny, but it has a direct effect on the balance between Light and Darkness. It is fairly simple to introduce trifling changes in the destiny of an ordinary human being. It is rather more difficult to make even insignificant changes in the destiny of an Other. And the more powerful that Other is, and the more serious the change, the greater the disturbance suffered by the Light and the Darkness. Respected members of the Tribunal, can you calculate the consequences that would ensue from introducing into a Great Enchantress\u0027s Book of Destiny an entry that would make her the mother of a Messiah?\" No one replied. \"Any one of us... all the Others taken together, would be dematerialized if they attempted that kind of meddling. We\u0027d be reduced to dust! The world would collapse! And you accuse me of committing such acts.\" \"Light magician Gesar, what changes were entered into Svet-lana Nazarova\u0027s Book of Destiny?\" Gesar shrugged. \"Nothing but trifling details. I am obliged to be concerned for my colleagues\u0027 well-being, am I not? A trip to some Italian resort or other... a course of lessons in a driving school... and something else... I can present a detailed list, if you wish. There\u0027s nothing serious. Just the small pleasures of human life.\" Witezslav thought for a moment and asked, \"Where were the new entries made? Before or after the entry about the birth of the greatest of all Light Enchantresses?\" \"I think, before ...\" Gesar said with a smile. \"And in that way, you adjusted the time of the event.\" Witezslav was not asking¡ªhe was thinking out loud. \"You maximized the probability that Svetlana\u0027s future daughter would be a Messiah of the Light...\" \"Possibly,\" Gesar agreed. \"But what of that? All I did was to improve the daily life of one of my colleagues.\" \"And could you not have used other methods to improve Svetlana Nazarova\u0027s living conditions? Free vacations, bonuses, friendly advice?\" Gesar looked genuinely offended now. \"I made use of what came to hand. The Inquisition has a right to be surprised if I hammer in nails with a microscope... But there\u0027s no way you can charge me with that.\" The Inquisitors exchanged glances. This time the silent consultation lasted for almost a minute. Edgar felt a trickle of cold sweat running down his back. It would really cause a ruckus if the Inquisition charged Gesar. The dematerialization of a Great Magician was not such a simple proposition as dealing with the four Finns... \"Not cognizable,\" Witezslav said eventually. \"Great Magician Gesar, having heard your explanations, the Inquisition accepts that you have not violated the letter of the Treaty...\" \"The letter or the spirit.\" Gesar corrected him sharply. \"The letter or the spirit,\" the vampire agreed in a voice that betrayed his frustration. \"However, your actions are still considered to be dubious and dangerous.\" \"No more so than the attempt by the Day Watch of Moscow to eliminate Svetlana Nazarova shortly before her initiation,\" Gesar snapped. \"Do you have any more questions for me?\" \"No,\" said Witezslav. \"You may return to your seat.\" Throughout the questioning, Zabulon had stood modestly on the very edge of the circular grille... He didn\u0027t seem upset that no charges had been brought against Gesar. And that made Edgar feel uneasy. \"Dark magician Zabulon, the Inquisition has some questions for you,\" said Witezslav. \"Was the attack by the sect of the Regin Brothers provoked by you?\" \"No one is obliged to testify against himself...\" Zabulon said in a dull voice. \"Is that a confession?\" the vampire asked in a lively tone. \"No, it is a reminder of the law. You have no right to ask such a question. Therefore I shall not answer it.\" \"Very well. Your objection is accepted. Great Magician Zabulon, have you been planning, in order to oppose the future Messiah of the Light, to resurrect the Great Magician Fafnir, who was consigned to the Twilight and dematerialized more than a thousand years ago?\" Zabulon began blinking rapidly and exclaimed in a voice full of amazement, \"Where did you get a nonsensical idea like that?\" \"Did you act to prevent the initiation of Svetlana Nazarova and carry out other actions directed against her?\" \"Yes, within the limits permitted by the Treaty,\" Zabulon replied briskly. \"And Fafnir?\" \"What about Fafnir?\" said Zabulon, answering a question with a question. He looked at Edgar and winked. \"Why did you send to Prague a certain member of the Day Watch, ideally suited for the rematerialization of Fafnir?\" \"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about!\" \"Did you plan to exploit the following parallels: Fafnir as the Antichrist, the four members of the Regin Brothers sect as the four horses of the Apocalypse...\" Zabulon burst into laughter. He laughed and wheezed happily for a long time, the way someone might laugh if they had just pulled off a risky but very amusing hoax. Then he wiped away the tears that had sprung to his eyes and said in a calmer voice, \"I am delighted by the sense of humor demonstrated by the members of the Inquisition. Fafnir was an insane psychopath. I actually knew him personally and there is nothing I would like less than to meet him again... in any case, he wouldn\u0027t suit as a Messiah of Darkness. That\u0027s beyond his level... Eliminating Svetlana, now...\" Zabulon smiled. \"... That\u0027s a possibility. But at such a price... oh, no, never. And as for those half-wit Finnish magicians... what did you say they were¡ªthe horses of the Apocalypse?\" Edgar felt like a total idiot. He looked imploringly at Witezslav. But the vampire hadn\u0027t given up yet. \"Why did you carry out the following actions: arranging the death of Alisa Donnikova, which can be interpreted as a ritual sacrifice for rematerialization, and ordering two portraits from a well-known Moscow artist¡ªone of the Dark magician Edgar and one of the dragon Fafnir?\" Zabulon became more serious: \"I would also like to understand the circumstances of Alisa\u0027s death better! As I understand, it is to be the subject of the next inquiry. Well, and as for the portraits...\" The head of Moscow\u0027s Day Watch reached inside his jacket and took out two small pictures in frames, about twenty by thirty centimeters. Edgar was horrified to recognize one as a portrait of himself. The other showed a dragon contorted by convulsions. \"This is a small Christmas present for one of my finest employees¡ªplease pardon an old man\u0027s sentimentality...\" And with that Zabulon took a step toward Edgar and held the portrait out to him. It was a good portrait¡ªno two ways about it. But Edgar was only frightened even more by Zabulon\u0027s whisper: \"Smart boy...\" Zabulon returned to the circle. \"And the second picture?\" Witezslav asked. \"Pure sentimentality,\" Zabulon repeated. \"Those Regin Brothers stirred up old feelings. I remembered Fafnir and... decided to have a portrait of him made as a keepsake...\" \"You were not planning to bring him back to life?\" Witezslav asked again. This time Zabulon answered very seriously and apparently with absolute sincerity. \"Not for a moment. There are less disruptive ways to achieve my goal.\" The Inquisitors exchanged glances. \"Great Magician Zabulon,\" said Witezslav. \"The Inquisition has no charges to bring against you: You may return to your seat. However, we remind you that taken all together your actions appear extremely ambiguous and dangerous...\" \"I understand, I understand,\" Zabulon muttered as he walked out of the circle. \"Soon it will be impossible to pick your nose without permission...\" Edgar looked at Gesar, expecting the old intriguer to be angry. But no. Gesar wasn\u0027t angry. He even seemed to have taken a genuine interest in what Zabulon had said. That is, he had been quite convinced that the head of the Dark Ones would wriggle out of everything, but he was interested in all the details. They\u0027d known all of this beforehand! Edgar struggled desperately to gather his scattered thoughts. That meant Svetlana really was going to be the mother of a Messiah of the Light... and a female one¡ªthat was a surprise! Zabulon was fighting against it, but... but not by creating an Antichrist in the flesh... that had only been a diversionary maneuver, one in which Edgar had behaved like a naive child. But then what was the most important thing? \"The Inquisition now moves on to the consideration of the most important matter of the day, which is of exceptional importance for the Light and the Darkness,\" said Witezslav, as if he were answering the question that Edgar hadn\u0027t asked. \"The case of Igor Teplov, a third-level magician of the Moscow Night Watch. Is everyone familiar with the materials of the case?\" Nobody said anything. Everybody had been familiar with the materials for a long time... \"I offer the prosecuting counsel, Anton Gorodetsky, the floor.\" The Light One was standing opposite Edgar. He raised his head and nodded curtly to Witezslav. \"I shall be brief. In essence, our charges are simple¡ªwe accuse the respected magician Zabulon, here present, of deliberately sending Alisa Donnikova to the Artek camp, knowing that Igor Teplov would be there, restoring his powers. Zabulon had probably read the reality lines and realized that for Igor and Alisa those conditions would immediately lead to... to love between them. A tragic and hopeless love, since the young people served different powers. A love that would end in a duel which would lead to the death of either Igor or Alisa, while the surviving opponent would be condemned by the Inquisition. We accuse Zabulon of the deliberate and cynical elimination... attempted elimination... of the Moscow Night Watch agent Igor Teplov. We therefore request the Inquisition to withdraw the charge brought against Igor Teplov of violating the Treaty and murdering Alisa Donnikova.\" \"Is that all?\" Witezslav asked after a pause. \"No. We also request the court to consider the matter of the death of a young boy who was not an Other, as a result of the duel. Insofar as the duel was arranged by Zabulon...\" \"Objection,\" Zabulon exclaimed in a squeaky voice. \"Objection sustained,\" the vampire ruled. \"Since we believe the duel to have been arranged by Zabulon, he is also guilty of the boy\u0027s death, for which Igor Teplov cannot be blamed. That is all.\" Witezslav turned his head to look at Zabulon. \"Can you reply to the essence of the matter?\" \"There will be no answer¡ªI have already explained the reason,\" Zabulon replied coolly. \"I offer the floor to the counsel for the defense.\" Edgar sighed and began. \"My colleague\u0027s speculations are all highly diverting. We are witnessing an attempt to shield a criminal...\" \"Objection!\" Anton put in quickly. \"To shield the accused,\" said Edgar, correcting himself. \"Igor Teplov is guilty of the murder of the young witch Alisa Don-nikova. And the worst thing about it is that he loved her with all his heart. And worse again, in the grip of his maniacal passion, Igor Teplov incidentally caused the death of the boy Makar Kanevsky. He killed a child. A human child, who also had a right to live. And there is more. As a result of his extensive gathering of Power from children on vacation at Artek, seven of them suffered from nightmares for three months. Two cases of persistent incontinence were recorded. Nine-year-old Yurik Semetsky, a resident of Moscow, died of asphyxiation a month after returning from Artek, when he drowned in his bath. We do not know as yet if this was a result of the actions of Igor Teplov... the Light magician Igor Teplov.\" He looked at the accused. Igor\u0027s face was stony. Impervious. Expressionless. \"The Light Ones can put forward their groundless accusations as long as they wish,\" said Edgar. \"Without any proof, without even any cogent explanation as to why the Day Watch of Moscow would sacrifice a young and promising member of its staff who had already received several commendations from the head of the Watch, in order to eliminate a third-level Light magician who possesses no real talent... That is a matter for their consciences. We only request the Inquisition to consider the situation impartially and punish the guilty party for violation of the Treaty.\" Edgar took a breath and added the final, decisive phrase: \"We have heard a lot said about how Light magicians who commit some ethically unjustifiable act dematerialize themselves voluntarily. They withdraw into the Twilight under the burden of their shame... We have all heard a lot about this. But I, for instance, have never actually seen it. No doubt Igor Teplov regards the murder of a girl who was in love with him, and likewise the death and suffering of innocent human children, as ethically irreproachable actions.\" He stopped speaking. The Inquisitors exchanged glances. Then Witezslav asked, \"Do the parties to the case have any proof that their assertions are correct?\" Gesar said nothing, but Zabulon asked in surprise, \"Pardon me, but what proof can I offer that I\u0027m not a camel? Let those who have uttered such nonsense attempt to prove it.\" \"The Inquisition has heard the opinions of the two sides,\" said the vampire. \"Accused, do you have anything to add?\" Igor Teplov nodded. \"Yes. I admit that my actions were not entirely justified... and I profoundly regret their consequences. I... I had...\" He broke off, then started talking more quickly. \"I had very strong feelings for Alisa Donnikova. But when I learned she was a Dark witch, it affected the balance of my mind. I do not ask for clemency. I have already condemned myself. But...\" He turned sharply toward Zabulon. \"You are the murderer! You sent Alisa to her death. And that is why I have to stay alive... I have to, so that you will not profit from your villainy.\" Zabulon merely shrugged and gave a heavy sigh. \"Do you have any proof?\" the vampire asked. Igor shook his head. \"The Tribunal is aware of the significance of this case,\" said Witezslav. \"Although neither side has adduced any evidence, the Inquisition considers it important to determine who is the real guilty party. Therefore...\" Edgar suddenly saw Zabulon\u0027s expression change: His face froze halfway through a sad smile. \"Therefore the Inquisition will continue to question witnesses. Alisa Donnikova will be temporarily rematerialized.\" \"Objection!\" said Zabulon, rising to his feet. \"This case is not important enough to disturb the peace of the departed!\" \"Objection overruled. The Inquisition requests Anna Leme-sheva, who has come here on the Inquisition\u0027s instructions, to advance to the center of the hall. Her body will be used for the temporary rematerialization of Alisa Donnikova.\" Lemesheva began to squeal. But a moment later two young Inquisitors were already leading her, twitching feebly, out into the center of the hall. \"The expenditure of energy in this process will be borne by the Night Watch of Moscow and it will not be refunded no matter what the outcome of the trial,\" Witezslav continued. \"Great Magician Gesar, do you possess the required reserves of Power?\" \"Yes,\" said Gesar, getting to his feet, \"I do.\" Edgar felt he was completely losing the thread of events. What was so important about this Igor Teplov that Zabulon would sacrifice his lover for him and Gesar would expend such a colossal amount of Power? \"Proceed with the rematerialization,\" said Witezslav. \"Any attempt to hinder it is punishable by immediate death.\" Several of the Inquisitors moved forward slightly, and Gesar sighed and stepped toward Lemesheva. She squealed again, and then fell silent, staring at the Light magician with glazed eyes. And then Edgar had to squeeze his own eyes shut. There was such a colossal amount of energy raging in the cen-ter of the hall that he simply couldn\u0027t look. He sensed the Inquisitors erecting magical barriers around Gesar and Lemesheva, one after another. He sensed the barriers crumbling under the pressure of unimaginable Power. And he felt the Twilight shudder as it was torn open through all the layers that Edgar knew and those he had never even suspected existed. If this was temporary rematerialization, then what must a permanent rematerialization be like? The storm died away. Gesar slowly stepped backward. There were three figures left in the center of the hall¡ªthe Inquisitor Witezslav, the Light magician Igor Teplov, and the Dark witch Alisa Donnikova. Alisa was trembling, coughing, and clutching at her throat. Edgar shuddered. He didn\u0027t know what happened to Others there... in the Twilight. And he didn\u0027t really want to know, to be quite honest. But Alisa had just recovered consciousness at the moment when her human life had come to an end. She had come back to life with a searing pain in her lungs, still choking on seawater, struggling desperately with the pressure that Teplov had brought down on her. \"Alisa Donnikova,\" the vampire began. Even his voice trembled¡ªtemporary rematerialization was an infrequent procedure, very infrequent... \"You have been temporarily rematerialized and are now in the premises of the European Tribunal of the Inquisition in Prague. Do you understand me?\" Alisa Donnikova straightened up, already controlling her wheezing. She was looking at Igor Teplov. And nobody else. \"Do you understand me?\" Witezslav repeated. \"Why... in Prague?\" Alisa asked. She was taking rapid, deep breaths, as if she simply couldn\u0027t get enough air¡ªeven the damp air in this dungeon. \"That is not important, Alisa Donnikova. You have been summoned to our world as a witness. A great deal depends on what you say.\" \"Can... can I stay here? Again? Forever?\" Alisa asked. But she was only looking at Igor. \"No,\" the Inquisitor replied honestly. \"Will you answer my questions voluntarily?\" Alisa tossed her head to and fro, with a strange, desperate pride. \"Yes, I will, Inquisitor. Ask.\" But she was only looking at Igor. \"The questions concern your duel with the Light magician Igor Teplov, here present. Was the challenge to the duel made in accordance with all the rules?\" \"Yes.\" \"Tell me, Alisa, do you accuse Igor Teplov of your death?\" Alisa smiled. She gestured with her hand¡ªwithout turning around, but unerringly indicating Zabulon. \"No.\" She was only looking at Igor. \"Do you have any charges to bring against your... opponent?\" She only shook her head. \"Alisa Donnikova, can you accuse anybody who is present here of provoking the sad events that led to your death?\" \"Zabulon,\" Alisa said in an absolutely indifferent voice. \"It was his operation.\" \"You cowardly fool!\" Zabulon shouted. \"They won\u0027t rema-terialize you anyway! What are you doing, witch?\" It was only then that Alisa Donnikova turned toward Zabulon. Under her gaze the leader of the Dark Ones fell silent. \"Zabulon, have you forgotten what you said to me when I appealed to you as I was drowning?\" \"Stupid, vengeful little fool,\" Zabulon said in a calmer voice. Alisa shook her head. She looked at Igor again and said in a strange, mocking tone of voice, \"What has vengeance got to do with it... Love is also a great power, Zabulon.\" \"The Inquisition has no further questions,\" Witezslav said quickly. \"Gentlemen... I think to continue with this scene... would be unworthy of Others. The charge against Igor Teplov of violating the Treaty is dismissed. Alisa Donnikova can... can go back now.\" Edgar seemed to be watching in a dream as Gesar got to his feet. The triumphant, victorious Gesar, with Zabulon hunched over on his bench... the defeated Zabulon. It was only when the faces of the Great Magicians suddenly trembled in surprise and confusion that he looked back at the center of the hall. Alisa Donnikova was disappearing. Her body was changing, sinking into the Twilight as a pale, insubstantial shadow. Leme-sheva was crawling on all fours toward Zabulon\u0027s feet. But Igor Teplov was also disappearing. Withdrawing into the Twilight. Edgar hadn\u0027t lied. This really was the first time he had ever seen a Light magician dematerialize. Voluntarily. Without any fighting or screaming or streams of Power. Just for one moment Igor Teplov, already transformed into an almost insubstantial shadow, turned to glance at his comrades. With a glance that looked guilty. But apart from that, he only looked at Alisa. Then he disappeared. The Twilight closed up. The air in the hall was icy, there was white, bristling hoarfrost clinging to the walls like a shroud of mourning. The triumphant smile was slowly returning to Zabulon\u0027s face. Gesar was looking at the empty circular grille with a weary, sad expression. \"Well?\" Zabulon shouted. \"Well? You see? Now where\u0027s your mentor? Where is he, the only one who was capable of educating the Messiah of the Light?\" He laughed and patted Lemesheva\u0027s head¡ªshe was standing on her knees in front of him. Then he turned to the Inquisition and said, \"Yes, it was a Day Watch operation. Within the limits of the Treaty. The exchange of two equal pieces¡ªAlisa Donnikova for Igor Teplov. Do you have any more charges to bring against us?\" \"The Inquisition has no charges to bring against you...\" the vampire said slowly. He rubbed his face with his hand. \"In view of all the circumstances... The Inquisition will consider the question of the early restoration of Svetlana Nazarova\u0027s Power. But that... will be later. Everyone... everyone may leave the hall.\" Svetlana was the first to get up from her seat. She walked up to Zabulon and stood for a second, looking into his face. Edgar suddenly realized with a sinking heart that the enchantress was going to hit the magician. But all she did was say something to him, then turn away and walk out abruptly. Edgar\u0027s legs felt stiff and awkward as he left his desk. He almost bumped into Gesar, who was musing sadly, engrossed in his own thoughts. Anton immediately came up to Gesar, pushing Edgar aside. He exclaimed, \"So what does this mean... Svetlana\u0027s daughter can be an Other, but not grow up to be the Messiah of the Light?\" Gesar nodded. \"Why?\" Anton asked with a stupid air. \"Surely Svetlana herself...\" \"Being a Great Enchantress and raising a Great Enchantress are two quite different things,\" Gesar said wearily. \"Alas. I... so far I can\u0027t see anyone else to match Igor. I... I didn\u0027t know how much he loved that witch! I would have looked for some other way.\" \"Whose daughter will it be?\" Anton suddenly asked. \"Svetlana\u0027s and...\" \"Whose? If you stop standing there like a fool, gaping at an old idiot, and go after your wife¡ªit will be yours!\" Anton gave a feeble nod and went dashing out of the hall. Edgar also wanted to ask Gesar a couple of questions, but he caught the Light One\u0027s glance and decided not to risk it. He turned away and stepped onto the narrow gray wedge of the Inquisition that jutted out between the black and white halves of the hall. The Inquisitors were already pulling off their robes. One of them casually tossed his robe into Witezslav\u0027s arms, opened a portal, and disappeared. The others left the usual way, through the door. The vampire looked at Edgar and asked, \"Want to try it on?\" \"I\u0027m not sure the cut will suit me,\" Edgar replied in a quiet voice. \"Who knows? But it\u0027s worth a try. Or are you intending to go back to Moscow?\" Edgar carefully took the crumpled gray material out of the vampire\u0027s hands. He asked awkwardly, \"I beg your pardon... but what was it that Svetlana said to Zabulon?\" \"An Inquisitor has to have good hearing.\" A crooked grin appeared on the vampire\u0027s face. \"Almost nothing at all. I\u0027d call it a curse, but the Light Ones don\u0027t even know how to curse properly... She said: \u0027May no one ever love you.\"\" Edgar nodded. He shrugged and said, \"He doesn\u0027t need anyone to, anyway.\" Moscow-Nikolaev-Lazurnoe June-October","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/day-watch-watch-2/page-20.html","bookId":2624,"book":{"id":2624,"title":"Day Watch (Watch #2)","description":"Storyline: Day Watch (Watch, #2) Day Watch (Russian: Dnevnoi Dozor, Дневной дозор) is a fantasy novel by Russian authors Sergey Lukyanenko and Vladimir Vasilyev.
