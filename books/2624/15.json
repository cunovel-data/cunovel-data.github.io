{"id":101483,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Gesar had summoned Anton in the evening, when the analysts and the technical staff had already gone home, and the field operatives who happened to be on duty that night had only just begun arriving at headquarters. The corridors on the second floor smelled of freshly brewed coffee, hot cinnamon buns, and mild, fragrant tobacco¡ªthat year a fashion for smoking pipes had swept through almost the entire Night Watch staff. Even the women hadn\u0027t escaped it.\n It was about a year already since Anton had worked in the IT department; Tolik had replaced him as boss of the computers and the girls who operated them. A second-level magician¡ªAnton had been classed as second level at the beginning of the year¡ªwas too important a figure to be spending his time stuck in a chair, tapping away at a keyboard and debugging programs.\n \"Like some coffee?\" Semyon asked. Anton nodded, and just at that moment the phone rang. Silence fell instantly in the little room where the four field operatives¡ªAnton, Semyon, Garik, and Bear¡ªwere sitting. They could all sense a call from the boss.\n And who it was for.\n Anton\u0027s colleagues watched closely as he picked up the receiver.\n \"Come in to see me as soon as you\u0027re free,\" Gesar ordered him without saying hello. \"Finish your coffee and then come in.\"\n \"Very well,\" Anton replied in a steady voice. \"As you wish, Boris Ignatievich.\"\n He thought for a moment and then lit his pipe. If Gesar hadn\u0027t warned him time was short, it meant there was no great hurry.\n \"You in line for a dressing-down?\" Garik inquired. Anton just shrugged. He could be in line for anything, from a charge of betraying the cause of the Night Watch to a promotion, from being told to stay in the office and not stick his nose outside to being ordered to storm the Dark Ones\u0027 headquarters. When a magician of the highest level got some idea into his head, it was pointless trying to guess his plans. Especially if that magician was in the kind of bad mood that Gesar had been in for the last few months.\n Basically they were all feeling pretty lousy. This year had been just one failure after another. It had all started in the summer, when the workaday, humdrum arrest of a witch practicing magic illegally had spilled over into conflict with the Dark Ones. Then the fine young magician Igor Teplov, who had drained his powers in that conflict, had been sent to the Artek children\u0027s camp to recover and run foul of a deliberate provocation by the Dark Ones. A witch called Alisa Donnikova had managed to enchant him and make him fall in love with her. She was Zabulon\u0027s girlfriend, the same Dark bitch who had interfered time and again in the Night Watch\u0027s most complicated intrigues. This time Alisa hadn\u0027t gone unpunished¡ªIgor had killed her. But in the process he had exceeded the limits of force permissible in self-defense, and now his fate hung by a thread.\n About a month later Vitaly Rogoza had turned up, and that had proved to be a real disaster. At first they\u0027d taken him for an ordinary Dark One, then they\u0027d begun to suspect the visiting Ukrainian was an emissary, sent to assist the Day Watch. But Rogoza had turned out to be a Mirror¡ªthat very rarest of phenomena, which has been recorded less than ten times in the entire history of the Watches. He was a direct creation of the Twilight, a monstrous fighting machine molded out of a quite unexceptional individual, who might not even have been an Other. If only they\u0027d realized that straightaway... but they hadn\u0027t. And in the struggle with the Mirror, Tiger Cub had been killed, Svetlana had lost her powers, and several other magicians had suffered to a greater or lesser degree.\n Things were very, very bad...\n Anton had cursed himself over and over again for not realizing the need to conduct a detailed analysis of the circumstances in which the Mirror had appeared. After all, there were similar cases in the secret archives¡ªthe appearance of a magician who evaded classification, a rapid increase in his powers, a decisive skirmish¡ªand then he disappeared. Everything fit. Right down to the final moment, when Vitaly Rogoza had melted into thin air, dematerialized, and vanished into the depths of the Twilight that had given birth to him.\n But never mind Anton, never mind even Garik or Semyon. For them a Mirror was one of those numerous exotic occurrences they\u0027d only heard about in lectures or read about in the archives. Why hadn\u0027t Gesar or Olga, with all their experience, realized the truth immediately? They\u0027d run into Mirrors before, after all...\n Things were bad. Nothing was going right. As if the Darkness had been infuriated by the Night Watch\u0027s recent successes and was striking blow after blow. And very successfully too, it had to be admitted.\n Anton shook his head to refuse the second cup of coffee that Semyon offered him. He carefully cleaned out his pipe, casting an involuntary sideways glance at Bear.\n He was cleaning out his pipe too. The little pipe with a long, thin stem that had belonged to Tiger Cub. The girl had only smoked it occasionally, mostly to keep her friends company. But now that Tiger Cub was gone, Bear smoked his own pipe and hers by turns. It was probably the only way he had expressed his feelings since Tiger Cub\u0027s death¡ªthe gentle way he handled that pipe... and perhaps that fixed stare when Vitaly Rogoza had begun to dematerialize. A gaze full of regret: Bear hadn\u0027t had a chance to get his hands on Rogoza, he hadn\u0027t been able to satisfy his thirst for vengeance...\n Like Alisher, the Light One from Uzbekistan whose father had been killed a year earlier by Alisa.\n Anton had his own accounts to settle with the Day Watch and its chief, too. But of course the accounts would never be paid. The Treaty shackled both Watches, the Inquisition made sure it was observed, and the only way around it was to cut right to the chase and challenge an enemy to a duel... which was what Igor had done, for instance. And what was the result? The witch was dead, but now the magician was facing dematerial-ization, waiting for the decision of the European office of the Tribunal. And it wasn\u0027t hard to guess what it would be...\n Anton got up, nodded to his friends, and made for the boss\u0027s office on the third floor.\n He was feeling really sick at heart, not looking forward at all to the approaching New Year festivities that people everywhere around the planet were anticipating so eagerly, as if the number 2000 could change anything. What did it all really matter? But when Anton reached the door of the office, he felt a faint stirring of interest.\n The magical defenses there were very strong. The Night Watch building itself was protected against observation, and the employees\u0027 offices and conference halls had additional screening. But it seemed like today Gesar had put in a lot of extra effort to ensure confidentiality: The air in the corridor was still and stifling, saturated with energy. And this invisible wall extended into the Twilight, much farther down than the first two levels that were accessible to Anton.\n He walked into the office and closed the door firmly behind him. He sensed a slight movement behind his back as the defensive field closed together after being torn for a moment.\n \"Sit down, Anton,\" said Gesar, and asked in a perfectly friendly voice: \"Tea, coffee?\"\n \"Thanks, Boris Ignatievich,\" Anton replied, calling Gesar by his human name, \"but I\u0027ve just had one.\"\n \"A mug of beer then?\" Gesar asked unexpectedly.\n Anton had to stop himself rubbing his eyes or even pinching his arm. Gesar had never shunned the joys of life. He could leap about with the young people at a discotheque, flirt a bit with the silly young girls, and even take off with one of them for the whole night. He enjoyed sitting in a restaurant over dishes of exotic food, driving the waiters backward and forward, and setting the cooks trembling with his knowledge of exotic culinary subtleties. He could even go out with his staff, acting like one of the boys and drinking beer with smoked bream, vodka with freshly salted pickles, and wine with fruit.\n But there was one thing Gesar never did, and that was to hold parties at the workplace. The ten members of the analytical section who drank a bottle of cognac to celebrate the birthday of Yulia, the watch\u0027s youngest enchantress and a universal favorite, had been punished with genuinely brilliant originality. Not even an intercession by Olga, who had been involved in the misdemeanor along with the others, had helped. The punishment had been devised individually for each of them, and it had been the most hurtful possible. Yulia, for instance, had been made to stay away from the Watch offices for a week and instead attend an ordinary school with teenagers her own age, go to the ice-cream parlor with the girls in her class, and go to the movies and discotheques with the boys. Yulia had returned to the Watch, fuming with indignation, and for ages she\u0027d kept repeating: \"God, if you only knew how stupid they all are! I hate them.\"\n For those three words \"I hate them!\" she received another day\u0027s penalty and a long lecture from Gesar on the subject of \"Can a Light enchantress entertain negative feelings for people?\"\n So now Anton was standing there in front of Gesar, frozen over the chair he\u0027d been about to sit down in. He\u0027d forgotten what he was doing.\n \"Sit down, will you?\" Gesar prompted him. \"No point in standing. So will you have a beer?\"\n \"It\u0027s not quite the weather for it,\" Anton replied, indicating the window with his eyes. Outside there were large, heavy flakes of snow swirling through the air. A genuine Christmas blizzard. \"Not the right weather... and not the right place?\"\n He surprised himself by making the last phrase sound like a question.\n Gesar thought for a moment. \"Yes, we could go to some amusing little place,\" he said, with a note of real interest in his voice. \"For instance, that little cafe in the South-West district, where all the dentists go. Can you imagine it? The favorite cafe of Moscow\u0027s tooth-pullers? And there\u0027s a little pizzeria at the Be-lorussian station, that\u0027s a real blast...\"\n \"Boris Ignatievich,\" Anton asked, unable to resist, \"where do you dig all these places up from? The mountain-skiers\u0027 restaurant, the lesbians\u0027 bar, the plumbers\u0027 snack bar, the philatelists\u0027 pelmeni joint...\"\n Gesar shrugged and spread his arms: \"Anton, my dear fellow, let me remind you once again what we work with. We work with...\"\n \"The Dark Ones,\" Gorodetsky blurted out and sat down in the chair.\n \"No, my boy, you\u0027re wrong. We work with people. And people are not a herd of cloned sheep who chew their grass in synchronized motion and all fart at the same time. Every human being is an individual. That is our joy, because it makes the work of the Dark Ones harder. And it\u0027s also our misfortune, because it makes our work harder too. In order to understand these people, whose souls, after all, are what the endless battle between the Watches is fought over, we have to know them all. It\u0027s not just that I have to, you understand. We have to! And we have to understand every one of them¡ªfrom the pimply-faced kid who chews Ecstasy tabs at the discotheque to the ancient professor who\u0027s the last in a dying line of blue-blooded aristocrats and spends all his time growing cacti... Oh, by the way, the bar where cactus-lovers get together has rather interesting cuisine and highly original decor. But you and I can\u0027t go anywhere right now. Did you sense the defenses?\"\n Anton nodded.\n \"Believe me, I had good reason to install them. And sound security arrangements in a crowded place would be far more complicated. I don\u0027t think I can really afford to waste that much Power at the moment...\" Gesar rubbed his hand across his face and sighed. He looked really tired, all right. \"By the way... take this. A small present.\"\n Anton accepted the small object from his boss\u0027s hands with a surprised expression. It was something like a globe: a ball that was made out of thin needles of bone... yes, it was bone... bent into arcs and stuck into two little disks of wood at the poles. The ball was empty... But no, it wasn\u0027t. It was full of Power. Power that was sleeping, constrained.\n \"What is it?\" Anton asked, almost in a panic.\n \"Don\u0027t worry. It\u0027s not liquefied bliss.\"\n \"Er... what\u0027s liquefied bliss?\"\n Gesar sighed: \"How should I know? It was a joke. A figure of speech. A turn of phrase. A metaphor. I\u0027m not even sure that bliss exists, let alone whether it can be liquefied. What you\u0027re holding in your hands is something like a magical white noise generator. If you need to have an absolutely¡ªlet me emphasize that¡ªabsolutely secret conversation, one that nobody can listen to, no matter what means they use, simply break the ball in your hand. You\u0027ll probably cut your hand, that\u0027s just the unavoidable price. But then for the next twelve hours there\u0027ll be no way anyone can monitor or check what\u0027s happening in a sphere ten meters across, with you at the center, no matter what technical or magical means they use.\"\n \"Thanks,\" Anton said gloomily. \"Somehow a present like this fails to inspire me.\"\n \"You\u0027ll thank me again for it yet. So, will you have a beer or not?\"\n \"Yes. But why does it have to be beer?\"\n \"To avoid too serious a violation of my own rules,\" Gesar said with a contented smile. \"We\u0027re at work, after all.\"\n He pressed a button on the intercom and said quietly: \"Olya, bring us some beer.\"\n Nothing in the world was going to surprise Anton now. But Gesar released the button and explained anyway.\n \"Galochka\u0027s a magnificent secretary. But she\u0027s a fourth-level enchantress. And she could give information away to the enemy without even realizing it. So just for today I changed my secretary.\"\n A minute later Olga came in with a tray on which there were two immense glass mugs full of light-colored beer, an impressive crystal jug holding about two liters of the same drink, and a plate with an assortment of cheeses.\n \"Hi there, Antoshka,\" Olga said in a very friendly tone of voice. \"You like Budweiser, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"What Light One doesn\u0027t like light Czech beer?\" Anton asked, trying to joke. The joke fell flat, but his readiness even to attempt a pun was amazing. He hadn\u0027t felt like doing that for ages...\n \"How\u0027s Sveta doing?\" Olga asked, still in the same tone.\n Anton gritted his teeth. The weight that had fallen from his heart returned for a moment.\n \"Still the same...\"\n \"Nothing?\"\n Anton nodded.\n \"I\u0027ll call around to see her this evening,\" Olga told him. \"I think she\u0027s ready for visitors now. And I\u0027ll find some way to make her feel better... trust me.\"\n It was true. Who better to console a Great Enchantress who had lost her magic powers for a long time than another Great Enchantress who had been deprived of her powers for many decades in punishment for a misdemeanor?\n \"Yes, come round, Olga,\" said Anton. \"Sveta will be very glad to see you.\"\n Gesar cleared his throat gently.\n \"You\u0027ve got plenty of time,\" Olga snapped. \"Anton, you know... I wish you luck. I sincerely wish you luck.\"\n \"Luck with what?\" Anton asked, puzzled.\n Instead of answering, Olga leaned down over him and kissed him tenderly on the lips.\n \"Well now!\" was all Gesar could find to say.\n \"Ever since Anton and I swapped bodies,\" Olga remarked casually, \"you don\u0027t really have any right to be jealous of me with him. And especially over such a tiny thing. Right, boys! Behave yourselves, don\u0027t drink too much, and if there are any problems¡ªcall me.\"\n \"Any problems?\" Gesar echoed with a frown. But Olga was already on her way out. The Great Magician watched her go, and when the door closed, he sighed and said, \"Living with a Great Enchantress is a real ordeal. Even for me. How do you manage it, Anton?\"\n \"Svetlana didn\u0027t have time to become a genuinely Great Enchantress,\" Anton remarked. He picked up one of the mugs and took a mouthful of beer. It was excellent. Just the way real beer ought to be.\n \"But you\u0027re glad of that, surely?\" Gesar inquired.\n \"No.\" Anton took a piece of strong-flavored goat\u0027s milk cheese. \"I\u0027m not.\"\n \"Why not?\" Gesar asked with gentle curiosity. \"Now you have several decades of happy life as equals ahead of you. Ideally fifty whole years.\"\n \"Gesar, what happiness can there be if the woman I love feels like a worthless cripple?\" Anton asked sharply. \"And if it\u0027s my fault, at least partly.\"\n \"Partly?\"\n Anton nodded. \"Yes, exactly. Partly.\"\n Gesar paused. Then he asked the question Anton had been expecting three weeks earlier but had already stopped expecting.\n \"Tell me, what happened between you and Zabulon.\"\n \"He came to my apartment again. Like the first time.\"\n \"And he entered with the help of your vampire friend again?\" Gesar inquired.\n \"No, after the other time I closed my home to him. I simply don\u0027t understand how Zabulon could have got through.\"\n Gesar nodded and took a drink of beer.\n \"Then Zabulon suggested I should commit... an act of be-trayal. He said that Vitaly Rogoza was a Mirror-Magician created by the Twilight in response to the increasing strength of the Night Watch. That his main goal was to kill Svetlana or deprive her of her powers. And if I was late for the session of the Inquisition, then Rogoza would strip Svetlana of her Power and dematerialize.\"\n \"And you agreed?\"\n Anton thought before he formulated his answer. He\u0027d run through this conversation with Gesar plenty of times in his head. But he\u0027d never found the right words...\n \"Gesar, the only other alternative would have been continuing confrontation. Obviously, either Svetlana would have been killed, or...\"\n \"Or?\" Gesar was clearly interested.\n \"Or many Others would have been... less exalted members of the Watch. To weaken us to the same extent overall.\"\n Gesar nodded. \"You figured it out for yourself?\"\n \"No, not entirely. I rummaged in the archives and found a few similar cases, one of which ended with the annihilation of the entire Kiev division of Night Watch, apart from its leader, Alexander von Kissel. That time, the Mirror\u0027s target was apparently von Kissel, but he managed to protect himself. The result was that ordinary operatives and magicians died.\"\n \"But why didn\u0027t you contact me?\" Gesar asked. \"Why didn\u0027t you warn me about Zabulon\u0027s visit?\"\n \"How could I know what he was expecting to happen? Maybe just that¡ªfor me to go dashing to you for advice. Zabulon was clearly trying to trick me, but I couldn\u0027t figure out what the trap was. It could have been a mistake to contact you, or to keep quiet. So I chose a third way. I tried to prevent the Mirror getting to Svetlana. Using a very primitive method¡ªI rammed his car.\"\n \"Bravo,\" said Gesar in a strange, squeaky voice. \"Well done, Anton. It didn\u0027t work, but it was a good try. But why didn\u0027t you tell anyone who Rogoza was?\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell anyone, Boris Ignatievich?\" Anton asked, raising his head. \"Or are you trying to tell me it wasn\u0027t you who led the investigation into the events in Kiev in October 1906? Or is one lousy century too much for your memory to retain? The entire situation was a perfect parallel. A certain Vladimir Sobolev came to Kiev from Poltava and registered with the Night Watch. He was later found at the scene of the murder of a young streetwalker, where there were clear signs of vampirism, then he was caught near the spot where a witches\u0027 coven was dispersed...\"\n \"What did I summon you for?\" Gesar asked in a very loud, indignant voice. \"To question you about the dubious circumstances of your relations with Dark Ones or to hear you accusing me?\"\n \"You summoned me, Boris Ignatievich, to have a drink of beer. And to ask me to do something for you.\"\n Gesar started breathing heavily. Then he shook his head. \"No, I\u0027m not going to ask. I still have the right to order you.\"\n \"Go ahead,\" Anton said, pleased. \"I won\u0027t argue, I\u0027ll carry out my orders. Right down the line. Only that\u0027s not what you want, is it? An obedient agent without any initiative?\"\n Gesar shrugged. \"All right. You win. I want to ask you to do something for me, Anton...\"\n \"First answer me... about the Mirror.\"\n \"Then listen. Mirrors have appeared nine times¡ªif we take just the documented and proven instances. Only two of them have been on our side. The last three appearances of a Mirror have been on the side of the Dark Ones, each time at a place where the forces of Light had a significant advantage and plans were being made for... for a large-scale operation of some kind. It\u0027s impossible to fight a Mirror. He beats off any magical attack by rising to the level of his enemy and defends himself against ordinary attacks by using magical means. All you can do is choose who to sacrifice¡ªa dozen of the rank and file magicians or one of the Great Ones.\"\n \"And you decided to let him have Tiger Cub and Svetlana.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t decide a thing! In the first place, until Tiger Cub was killed I wasn\u0027t even sure that what we were facing really was a Mirror!\" Gesar smashed his fist down on the desk, spilling the beer. \"And nobody was supposed to die. It was all supposed to end with Rogoza being captured¡ªwhich would have meant he wasn\u0027t a Mirror at all, just an ordinary visiting emissary¡ªor with us retreating. I didn\u0027t expect Tiger Cub to blow her top like that!\"\n \"She was a very impulsive girl.\"\n \"No, Anton. You\u0027re wrong. She was an energetic and impulsive Other, but she had excellent control. And this outburst of hers...\" Gesar paused. \"It seems that I underestimated the strength of her feelings for Andrei Tiunnikov...\"\n \"They\u0027d been seeing each other a lot just recently,\" Anton admitted. \"He even went to her place out in the country, and Tiger Cub was very fond of her privacy. And when Andrei... well, just why did he go into Rogoza\u0027s room?\"\n \"To show off to Tiger Cub...\" Gesar sighed. \"Ah, you little boys and girls, still green, boasting to each other, showing off your magic, your battle scars, talismans, and amulets... why is there so much human stupidity in all of you?\"\n \"Because we are people. People who are Others, but still people. And we don\u0027t become genuine Others right away.\"\n Gesar nodded. \"You\u0027re right again, Anton. You have to live a complete human life, eighty years or a hundred, lose your family and all your loved ones who are human, see how ridiculous the politicians are, building their empires to last a thousand years, and the philosophers, creating their eternal truths for one or two generations... that\u0027s when you become an Other. But while you live your first, human life, you\u0027re still a human being. Even if you can enter the Twilight, cast spells, and read the reality lines... You\u0027re still a human being, Anton. And so is Svetlana. And Tiger Cub and Andrei were human beings. And your human side is where the Darkness catches you out. Your weaknesses, your emotions.\"\n \"Is love really a weakness?\"\n \"If you have love in you, it\u0027s a strength. But if you are in love, it\u0027s a weakness.\"\n \"We can\u0027t do it any other way yet.\"\n \"Yes, you can, Anton. It\u0027s hard for you, but you can...\" Gesar looked into his eyes. \"Well, are you still angry with me?\"\n \"No. I believe you tried... your best.\"\n \"Yes, I tried. And I pulled it off¡ªthat\u0027s the amazing thing.\"\n \"Tiger Cub and Andrei dead, Svetlana powerless¡ªand you say you pulled it off?\" Anton exclaimed indignantly.\n \"Yes. Because all the other options were far worse. And surprising as it may seem, what\u0027s happened doesn\u0027t simply play into the hands of Zabulon and his mangy curs.\" Gesar smiled. A cold, ironic smile. A very disturbing, suggestive smile.\n \"That still won\u0027t do Svetlana any good...\" Anton began. Then he stopped, because Gesar shook his head.\n \"It\u0027s not finished yet, Anton. In fact, it\u0027s only just begun.\"\n The chief of the Night Watch poured them each a second mug of beer, took a sip, and leaned back in his armchair.\n \"Boris Ignatievich...\"\n \"Anton, I understand everything. You\u0027re tired. I\u0027m tired too, we\u0027re all tired, we\u0027re full of bitterness, pain, anguish. But we\u0027re at war, and this war\u0027s a very long way from over yet. If you want to withdraw from it¡ªthen go. Live as an ordinary Light One. But while you\u0027re in the Watch... you are in the Watch, Anton?\"\n \"Yes!\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s excellent. Do you like the beer?\"\n \"Yes,\" Anton muttered.\n \"Well, that\u0027s excellent too. Because you\u0027re flying to the homeland of this divine beverage. To Prague.\"\n \"When?\" Anton asked stupidly.\n \"Tomorrow morning. Or rather, afternoon. The morning flight will be postponed until six in the evening and you\u0027ll take another flight with a stopover in Prague.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"You know that the European office of the Inquisition has moved from Berne to Prague?\"\n \"Yes, of course. Because of Fafnir\u0027s Talon, the artifact that those idiots stole...\"\n \"Precisely. Even without that, the Inquisition has a tradition of changing its location every fifty or a hundred years, and it was a very serious embarrassment for the Berne Watches. Anyway, they\u0027ve settled in now and finally got around to considering our case.\"\n \"So that\u0027s why I got this present... Igor?\"\n \"Yes. He\u0027s already there. We\u0027ve lodged an official complaint, claiming that the Dark Ones organized a deliberate provocation and Alisa Donnikova enchanted Igor, which was the reason for his nervous breakdown... and that unfortunate incident in which a boy drowned. The Dark Ones, of course, are claiming that Igor enchanted Alisa in an attempt to recruit her to our side...\"\n Andrei snorted at the absurdity of the accusation¡ªrecruiting a witch! As if a Dark One could ever stop being Dark. Frighten her, force her to collaborate, bribe her or blackmail her¡ªall that was possible. But to recruit a witch...\n \"Well then, the Tribunal will decide who was to blame and what degree of responsibility Igor bears. The lad challenged Alisa to an officially registered duel, so the Watch has nothing to answer for. But if the Inquisition accuses him of exceeding the limits of force required for self-defense or deliberate provocation¡ªthere\u0027s only one outcome for him. Into the Twilight. He\u0027s only half-alive as it is... and he doesn\u0027t even seem to want to fight. But we need Igor, Anton. You have no idea just how badly we need him!\"\n \"Boris Ignatievich, what really happened down there?\"\n \"Really? I don\u0027t know. We didn\u0027t arrange any provocations, you can trust me on that. I sent Igor on vacation because the lad had drained himself completely. Do you know how good working in a young Pioneer Camp is for restoring your powers? Smiling children\u0027s faces, happy laughter, cheerful voices...\" Gesar\u0027s voice warmed so much that Anton was almost expecting the serious boss of the Night Watch to lick his lips and start purring at any moment. But Gesar broke off and then continued: \"Either our accusation is just, and then there\u0027s a chance of saving Igor. Or everything that happened was just a tragic coincidence...\n in that case, there\u0027s nothing the Inquisition can accuse us of, but Igor won\u0027t survive the whole business. He\u0027s punishing himself for the death of that boy... and Alisa.\"\n \"What does Alisa matter?\"\n \"He really did fall in love with her... yet another half-baked Other.\" Gesar watched as the expression on Anton\u0027s face changed and nodded. \"Yes, he fell in love, no doubt about it. So, you\u0027re going to Prague. As our representative at the Tribunal. Defender and prosecutor in the same person. I\u0027ll give you all the necessary documentation in a moment.\"\n \"Ah... but...\" Anton was confused. \"I don\u0027t have any experience.\"\n \"Nobody has. But you\u0027ll acquire it. My heart tells me that as things develop there are going to be more and more of these... legal conflicts. Instead of honest battle and open combat. And don\u0027t you look so worried¡ªI\u0027ll probably come to Prague when the session starts. Possibly even with Olga and Svetlana.\"\n \"Why bring Svetlana?\"\n \"Maybe we\u0027ll be able to prove that Svetlana lost her powers because of a provocation by the Dark Ones and receive permission to restore her.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"The same way we did with Igor. The problem isn\u0027t that Svetlana can\u0027t restore her powers rapidly, in just a few months. She can. The problem is that I can obtain permission for healing a second- or third-level magician, but restoring the powers of a Great Enchantress is an extreme case. To do that, we need direct permission from the Inquisition. And not the Moscow branch¡ª it has to be the European office at least.\" Gesar raised his mug and smiled. \"Prosit, Anton. Let\u0027s drink to your success.\"\n \"Boris Ignatievich, even now you\u0027re still not telling me everything!\" Anton almost shouted.\n \"No, I\u0027m not. Although I\u0027ve already told you more than I ought to. But if you really want to lie awake all night with insomnia...\" Gesar thought carefully. \"Then add up together everything that\u0027s happened over the last year: the Chalk of Des-tiny, the death of Alisa Donnikova, the appearance of the Mirror, those ludicrous buffoons the Regin Brothers, and Fafnir\u0027s Talon... and the hysteria everywhere over the end of the second millennium.\"\n \"But there isn\u0027t a single thread connecting all these things,\" Anton blurted out.\n \"Then sleep well,\" Gesar said with a smile.\n Late December is a time of frivolity and bustling activity. A time of frantic preparation for the holidays, a time for presents and drinking champagne with colleagues, even during the working day. A time of brilliant illuminations in the streets, a time for New Year tree bazaars. With the approach of Christmas and the New Year, even the eternal confrontation between the Others dies down, and Light Ones and Dark Ones suddenly slip into a short-lived dreamy state and sometimes even feel like forgiving their rivals their old offenses. The less serious and deeply felt ones, that is.\n Edgar, the Dark magician, was late for a daily operational briefing for the first time since he had moved to the Russian capital from Estonia. The reason was trivial, but any self-respecting magician would have been ashamed to admit it.\n Edgar had been feeding the ducks at the pond on Chisto-prudny Boulevard. He\u0027d surrendered to the memories that had suddenly come flooding back and completely forgotten about the time. He\u0027d got lost in his dreams, like a teenage kid after a glass of beer. And when he finally surfaced, he realized the briefing had already begun.\n If age teaches you anything, then one of its lessons is certainly not to hurry if you\u0027re already late, so Edgar didn\u0027t rush off to flag down a car or make a headlong dash for the metro. He calmly finished crumbling the bun he\u0027d bought for the mallards darting about nimbly at the edge of the unfrozen patch of water or scrambling across the ice, and only then set off toward the Chistye Prudy metro station, with the Christmas snow crunching cheerfully under his shoes.\n Twenty minutes later Edgar entered the Day Watch office without hurrying and with his gravitas still intact. The elderly vampire couple on watch were decorating the New Year tree. They greeted Edgar just the way they were supposed to¡ªmeekly and respectfully.\n \"The chiefs been asking for you,\" the vampire husband told him. \"He said to go see him as soon as you turn up.\"\n \"Thank you, Filippich,\" said Edgar. \"Is the boss in his office?\"\n \"He is now.\"\n \"Aha. Happy holidays to you!\"\n \"And to you, Edgar.\"\n Edgar rode up to the top floors and sent Zabulon the sign of Hojd through the Twilight.\n \"Come in,\" Zabulon replied.\n The chief of the Day Watch required the strict observance of hierarchical discipline from his subordinates, but at the same time he somehow managed to respect the freedom of even the shabbiest werewolf among the security guards and to trust the magicians at the top of the Watch. He didn\u0027t question Edgar directly about why he\u0027d missed the daily briefing session. If he\u0027d missed it, there must have been a good reason.\n But there hadn\u0027t been any good reason, and so Edgar thought he\u0027d better simply tell Zabulon the way it was and leave it at that, especially since there hadn\u0027t been any serious operations planned for today. If a tricky situation had come up, they would have reached out to him through the Twilight or they could have simply given him a call on his cell, so Edgar wasn\u0027t feeling particularly guilty.\n \"Good evening, chief.\"\n \"Good evening, Edgar. How do you like this weather?\"\n \"Snow and no wind. I like it. I\u0027m sorry I missed the planning meeting, chief. There wasn\u0027t anything urgent, was there?\"\n \"No. But there will be now.\"\n Zabulon was dressed as usual in his favorite gray suit and gray shirt. Edgar thought he\u0027d never seen the chief dressed any other way. Always a suit and a gray shirt when he was in the ordinary world. And without any clothes at all in his Twilight form.\n \"Would you believe it, chief, I was daydreaming. Walking on the boulevard at Chistye Prudy, remembering Samara and 1912.\"\n Zabulon gave a faint smile and sang quietly: \"The photo studio... Samara wrapped in mist again, it\u0027s 1912...\"\n The chief of the Day Watch had a clear, resonant baritone voice. Even though the Dark magicians had known each other for many years, it was the first time Edgar had ever heard Zabulon sing.\n \"Were you feeding the ducks?\" Zabulon asked.\n \"Yes.\"\n Zabulon sighed as he indulged his memories briefly. Very briefly. Literally for half a minute. \"Okay, Edgar. Tomorrow you fly to Prague.\"\n \"For the Tribunal?\"\n \"Yes. It\u0027s going to hear several cases, including Alisa\u0027s murder and the Regin Brothers\u0027 case.\"\n \"But weren\u0027t they going to release them tomorrow?\" Edgar asked in surprise. \"Or have the Light Ones changed their mind?\"\n \"No, they haven\u0027t. They\u0027ve handed the case over to the European office of the Tribunal. And I think Gesar will try to lay the responsibility for what they did at our door. As if we\u0027d planned it. Or incited them.\"\n \"But they don\u0027t have any evidence! Not a shred!\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s why I\u0027m sending you to Prague. You can take a look, see what\u0027s what. And don\u0027t take it easy on anyone. We\u0027ve taken enough, we\u0027ve given way to them over the last two years¡ªit\u0027s time we held our heads up higher.\"\n \"It was the circumstances. That\u0027s what we gave way to,\" said Edgar. The prospect of spending Christmas and seeing in the year 2000 in the ancient Gothic city of Prague had really fired his enthusiasm. Edgar loved the solemn city¡ªit was the embodiment of the European spirit, a city where Dark Ones felt free and at ease.\n \"By the way. You\u0027ll probably be flying on the same plane as those Regin Brothers. Take a moment to drop them a hint that the Moscow Day Watch has no intention of abandoning Dark Ones who have suffered on its territory. Tell them not to panic or lose heart.\"\n \"And are we really going to defend them?\"\n \"Yes, we really are. You see, Edgar, I have a few plans that involve that absurd trio. For the time being I need this international alliance... So pay a bit of attention to them as well. The Light Ones will probably set a spy on their trail. Keep an eye on him too. Don\u0027t let him interfere. Don\u0027t get involved in any unnecessary conflict¡ªjust keep him at a distance, that\u0027s all.\"\n \"I understand, chief.\"\n \"Take these,\" said Zabulon, opening the safe beside the desk and handing Edgar two amulets and a charged wand. \"I don\u0027t expect you\u0027ll need to use the Mist. But just in case... And you know where to recharge the wand.\"\n \"At Kostnitsa? At that ossuary?\" Edgar asked, reacting immediately.\n Zabulon nodded.\n \"Darkness!\" said Edgar, almost feeling envious of himself. \"I haven\u0027t been there for seventy years!\"\n \"And you can purge yourself at the same time,\" Zabulon advised him. \"Do you know how?\"\n Edgar frowned. They might be friends, but after all, Zabulon was a magician beyond classification, and Edgar hadn\u0027t even reached the first level yet, although he obviously had the potential for it. Edgar still had to carry on using his ordinary human name, but on the other hand, his surname had been completely forgotten by now.\n \"I\u0027ve mastered the technique. In general terms.\" It was obvious that Edgar didn\u0027t like having to say that.\n \"Then you can practice it,\" said Zabulon, closing the subject. \"That\u0027s all¡ªnow go and get ready. If you have any business outstanding, hand it over to someone else. Shagron or Belashevich.\"\n \"I understand, chief. I will.\"\n \"Good luck.\"\n Edgar left the chiefs office, then called into his own for a moment, composed a message for Shagron, and suspended it in the Twilight before he set out for home. On his way out he ran into Alita.\n \"Hi there, beautiful!\"\n \"Hello, Edgar. How would you like to go to the skating rink?\"\n \"I don\u0027t have time.\"\n \"Oh, come on,\" said the young witch. \"It\u0027s almost New Year¡ª what business could you have to deal with? The Light Ones are more concerned with the quality of the champagne that\u0027s being made than their usual mean tricks. Holidays are for having fun, not for working.\"\n \"That\u0027s debatable,\" Edgar said with a sigh. \"But anyway, I don\u0027t have time. I\u0027m going away.\"\n \"Where to?\"\n \"To Prague.\"\n \"Ooh!\" Alita said enviously. \"For long?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. A week or so...\"\n \"The New Year in Prague!\" Alita sighed. \"And not just any New Year¡ªthe year 2000... Maybe I should go with you.\"\n \"Go if you like.\" Edgar didn\u0027t try to dissuade her. \"But not with me. I\u0027m not going to have fun...\"\n He felt a little envious too: If the witch went to Prague, she\u0027d be able to relax with a clear conscience. But Edgar had been on too many of these work trips to entertain any groundless illusions that they wouldn\u0027t involve much work.\n There was always plenty of work, and especially at holiday times, as bad luck would have it. And during the most important holidays (who would claim that a change in the first figure in the number of the year wasn\u0027t an important event?) there was always more work than even the gloomiest prognosis suggested.\n On his way home Edgar quickly reviewed the probabilities and established that the morning flight to Prague would be delayed until the evening and he would have to take an afternoon flight with a stopover in Prague. Of course, there weren\u0027t any tickets in the ticket office, and he couldn\u0027t really count on the special reserve either. But that didn\u0027t bother Edgar too much¡ª what could be simpler than the old trick with the double-booked ticket? And, of course, the \"right\" ticket would turn out to be the one bought by the Other. Even if he only bought it a minute before check-in.\n Packing for a trip doesn\u0027t take an Other long. Why bother taking things with you when it\u0027s simpler to buy them on the way? His entire luggage consisted of the amulets, the wand, and a briefcase containing a solitary magazine and several wads of American currency. Of course, an Other can get everything that money can buy without spending a kopeck or a dime. But it\u0027s not worth wasting the Power. And not all interventions are the same. Manipulate a sales assistant\u0027s mind for a piece of cake, and the Night Watch would nail you for an unsanctioned intervention. That would be just like them.\n And apart from that, Edgar would simply have felt sorry for the sales assistant. The cake wouldn\u0027t have bothered him, of course. What if he suddenly needed to steal a jeep from an automobile sales room? People were the Other\u0027s foundation. Their feed base and substratum. They should be treated with consideration... And there was no need to worry about that kind of ideology sounding too much like the Light Ones\u0027.\n The Dark Ones could tell the difference between treating human beings with consideration and doting on them.\n They could tell it very clearly.\n Edgar used the night to catch up on his sleep, although it was harder than he expected to get to sleep at such an unusual time. Even as he was sinking into slumber, Edgar regretted that he hadn\u0027t gone to the skating rink with Alita.\n In the morning Edgar discovered that someone had put a lot of work into improving his natural magical shell, strengthening it and weaving in stiff, tightly connected reinforcing threads. Zab-ulon, of course, who else? It couldn\u0027t be anyone else. Hm... thought Edgar. Could this mission really turn out to be complicated and dangerous? Or is Zabulon simply playing it safe?\n Since clashes with the Light Ones had become more frequent, Zabulon had installed personal protection for a lot of the members of the Day Watch. Just where did he get all the energy to maintain so many shields?\n There were probably only two Others in Moscow who knew the answer to that¡ªZabulon himself and his eternal opponent Gesar. And maybe the Inquisition. At least its top bosses.\n Shagron offered to give Edgar a lift to the airport. It seemed like the newly repaired magician simply enjoyed driving his newly repaired BMW around Moscow when the city was in a holiday mood. The excuse he invented couldn\u0027t have been any simpler or more convincing: a briefing on current business. Not that there was much business for Edgar to brief him on. The hysterical response of a thirteen-year-old girl who had discovered that she could enter the Twilight and accidentally looked at herself in a mirror while she was there. Win her confidence, talk some sense into her, support her... an assignment for a beginner. And then there was the gerontophilic succubus who was the laughing stock of half of Biruliovo.\n This wasn\u0027t even work. It was just a couple of trifling problems. Minor domestic turbulence.\n Just as he was walking into the airport terminal, Edgar got a call from another magician high up in the Day Watch¡ªthe magician that his colleagues knew as Yury, although he could obviously have used a Twilight name quite openly. Shagron had one for his special services to the Watch, and Yury was significantly more powerful and much older than Shagron.\n \"Hi, Edgar. On your way to Prague?\"\n \"What of it?\" Edgar asked, Odessa-style.\n \"Listen, and don\u0027t interrupt. I know a thing or two about the chief\u0027s plans. And why you\u0027re being sent there. It\u0027s not all as simple and clear-cut as it seems at first glance. There are several Light Ones leaving for Prague today and tomorrow, and I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if Gesar himself goes there in a few days. There are a few little signs that indicate the Light Ones are setting up a large-scale operation. Of course, Zabulon is planning an appropriate response. So you just be careful. Especially while you\u0027re traveling.\"\n Yury stopped, as if he were expecting a reply from Edgar, but Edgar didn\u0027t say anything¡ªhe remembered he\u0027d been told not to interrupt. He just reached into the Twilight, attempting to locate Zabulon¡ªbut he couldn\u0027t find the slightest trace of the chief. He couldn\u0027t tell where he was, what secret crannies he was lurking in, or what deep levels of the Twilight he was roaming through. The most powerful magicians had their own paths and their own motives, incomprehensible to those around them.\n \"You remember the chief sent Alisa Donnikova on vacation?\" Yury went on. \"Remember what happened to her. Of course, you want to know why I\u0027m telling you all this. I\u0027ll tell you right now. Because I\u0027m a Dark One. And also because I\u0027ve worked with you for quite a while already. Take it any way you like, but I\u0027d prefer to see you as a live, healthy Other, and not just another shadow in the Twilight. See you, Edgar.\"\n Edgar stood there for a while, thoughtfully squeezing the cell phone in his hand. Then he put it back on his belt, picked up his briefcase, and set off for the ticket desks.\n Darkness! the magician thought to himself. What was that? A warning of some kind? And obviously behind Zabulon\u0027s back. And he brought up that business with Alisa...\n Zabulon had simply sacrificed the witch Alisa. Coldly and without any unnecessary pity. Like a pawn in a game of chess. In the games played between the Watches it was absurd to develop any feelings for the faceless figures on the board... but Others know how to feel and love as well. Edgar felt genuinely sorry for Alisa, but he wouldn\u0027t have lifted a finger to save her, not even if he had known everything in advance. Every game has its own inflexible rules, set once and for all. And nobody who has joined in a game can ever withdraw from it, or go against the rules. The witch Alisa had made her exit, and the witch Alita had made her entry. The law of conservation in action. In fact, Alita promised to be more likeable...\n Working on autopilot, Edgar brainwashed the girl at the desk, still absorbed in his own thoughts. She gave him a little blue booklet with his ticket and canceled the ticket of some other unfortunate passenger. Unfortunately, he would just have to take a later flight, because in the world of people and Others, it was the latter who set the rules. Why did Yury feel the need to warn me? Edgar wondered as he stood at a bar counter with a glass of beer that was very expensive, but not very good. Surely not out of altruism? Nobody breaks the rules of the game that way.\n He recalled in passing that when Zabulon left Moscow, he hadn\u0027t left Yury or Nikolai as his deputy in charge, although they were the Day Watch\u0027s most powerful Dark magicians after the chief. He had appointed Edgar, who was substantially less powerful than either of them. Yury had already been acknowledged as a magician beyond classification in the nineteenth century, and Nikolai just recently, after the war. Edgar still hadn\u0027t even reached first level, and if he was honest, he hadn\u0027t even mastered the second level completely. Sure, Edgar was a powerful magician. Sure, he was more powerful than most of the Others in Moscow, Dark or Light. But he still couldn\u0027t match Yury and Nikolai.\n Just why had Zabulon done that? Was Yury trying to take a bit of petty revenge? Out of simple envy? Trying to scare him or even (you could never tell!) simply having a joke at his upstart colleague\u0027s expense?\n The way Edgar had been brought in from Estonia had been hasty and illogical too. There he was, living a quiet life up in the small Baltic country, running its small, drowsy Day Watch, and then suddenly¡ªslam bang! The urgent summons to Moscow, the mad scramble to get his successor in Tallinn up to scratch¡ªwho was a classical \"hot-headed Estonian boy,\" barely even fourth level... Edgar ought to give him a call, by the way. And then what had happened in Moscow? Edgar had been thrown straight into the crucible of a hectic two-week operation, and then, not long after that, he\u0027d taken part in a wild cavalry raid to rescue from the Light Ones a witch who\u0027d been practicing without a license. And that was all. After that, there\u0027d been more than three months of routine work until the middle of November, when he\u0027d suddenly been appointed acting chief of the Day Watch while Zabulon was away, and then there\u0027d been the Mirror\u0027s visit and the Tribunal at Moscow University.\n If he thought about it, it was quite possible that the old Day Watch magicians could try to teach this newcomer from the Baltic a lesson because he was making a career for himself too fast, but they could hardly believe he was actually conspiring to take over from the chief. Zabulon didn\u0027t leave Moscow very often. And when Zabulon was there, Edgar was no more than just another operational agent. A powerful one, of course, an elite operative, but he only had the same rights as the others.\n By the time his glass was empty, Edgar had decided to stop guessing at the reasons behind it all. His best bet was to try to figure out a line of conduct that took account of... of everything. Even the very wildest possibilities.\n All right. What was it that had finished off Alisa? She hadn\u0027t gathered enough Power in time. She hadn\u0027t recognized the Light Other, even though he was so close to her. She hadn\u0027t refused a duel that she was certain to lose. And most important of all¡ª she\u0027d given way to her emotions. She\u0027d tried to appeal to a Light One\u0027s feelings.\n Well, then, Edgar wasn\u0027t short of Power, and Zabulon had even given him some of his own. His two amulets were a real treasure house of Power, especially the one charged with the Transylvan-ian Mist. If Edgar used that one, every Other in Europe would sense the monstrous discharge of energy. Plus the battle wand¡ª a highly specialized weapon, but it was fast and reliable. Shahab\u0027s Lash was nobody\u0027s idea of a joke!\n That meant Edgar had to keep as close an eye as possible on the Light Ones. Oh yes, about the Light Ones... Just at that moment there were three of them in Sheremetievo. First, there was his old friend from previous operations, Anton Gorodetsky, who the lower-level Dark Ones had nicknamed \"Zabulon\u0027s favorite.\" In that business with the Mirror he\u0027d done just what Zabulon wanted for some reason, and helped the Dark Ones... Or had he just made everyone think he helped the Dark Ones? Probably that was it¡ªotherwise how could he have stayed on in the Night Watch?\n Second, there was a middle-aged female healer who had no connection with the Night Watch, thoughtfully sniffing perfumes in the duty-free shop. She probably just happened to be traveling that day by coincidence.\n Third, there was a militiaman who was an Other on duty at the check-in, as there was supposed to be in any airport.\n Apart from Edgar himself, there were four Dark Ones in the international terminal of Sheremetievo-2. First, his charges, the trio of Regin Brothers, who kept staring guardedly by turns at Edgar and Anton, who had installed himself in the bar at the far end of the hall. Plus a weak magician over by the gambling machines who was paying no attention to anything; he seemed to be trying to earn a bit of extra cash by getting the mechanism to pay out the maximum winnings. His kind was perfectly described by the phrase \"cheap trash.\"\n The basic situation couldn\u0027t have been clearer.\n Check-in and passport control went quickly; no visas were required for the Czech Republic. In fact, just in case, Edgar was carrying Estonian and Argentinian passports, both perfectly legal¡ªArgentina was a wonderful country that traded its own citizenship quite freely.\n Edgar spent the rest of the time until boarding in one of the bars. Naturally, not the one where Zabulon\u0027s favorite, the Light magician Gorodetsky, had installed himself. Edgar\u0027s glance and his had met just once¡ªI know you\u0027re here and you know I\u0027m here, and both of us know that the other knows his opponent... and we\u0027re on similar missions. To defend our own at the trial and rout our enemies...\n To Gorodetsky\u0027s credit, he\u0027d made his position perfectly clear: When the trial starts, that\u0027s when we\u0027ll get to grips. Meanwhile, let\u0027s just enjoy the flight and not get in each other\u0027s way.\n Strange, how easily they understood each other. Maybe it was just a hangover from those ancient times before the Others were divided into Dark Ones and Light Ones, when they simply stood up together against fate and the vicissitudes of life. Back then, of course, any healer was closer to a vampire than he was to any simple, luckless human being in the faceless mass of other people like him. The Twilight can bring you together.\n But the Twilight could separate you too. In fact, the Twilight was pretty good at it¡ªnowadays you simply couldn\u0027t find more irreconcilable enemies anywhere on earth than Dark Ones and Light Ones. The puny conflict between the USA and the Islamic world was nothing in comparison... Even the old Cold War between the USA and the USSR that was now a part of history hadn\u0027t come close to the war of the Watches. They were just childish games for foolish human beings.\n Edgar drank coffee that was extremely black, but not very good, thinking about everything at once and nothing in particular. For instance, why all these airport bars that were so expensive and didn\u0027t seem to be skimping on the ingredients of their food and drink managed to brew lousy coffee, pour bad beer, and make absolutely inedible sandwiches. Plenty of the problems of human life could be attributed to the struggle between the Watches, but this certainly wasn\u0027t one of them.\n His charges¡ªthe entire ill-assorted trio of them¡ªwere peering at him disapprovingly from the waiting hall. Of course, the Regin Brothers regarded him as just another cop. Let them. They were boneheads. Brainless, heedless boneheads. And since that was what they were, they could be used to serve the cause of Darkness. Zabulon had been quite right to decide to make use of them. That business with Fafnir\u0027s Talon had certainly put the Light Ones off their stride during Rogoza the Mirror\u0027s visit. With-out even knowing it, the Regin Brothers had taken one of the blows intended for the Day Watch and allowed the Mirror, who had already grown strong, to top himself right up with Power. That was really what had made certain that Zabulon and his cohorts would win out in the latest clash with the Light Ones.\n And serve them right.\n Edgar watched without the slightest sympathy as the courteous customs officers led away a furious gent in a prim, formal suit and expensive raincoat. It was his place that Edgar would be occupying on the flight to Prague.\n When they were already on their way, Edgar waited until one of the Regin Brothers left his seat and then sat down next to the one who seemed to be the most sensible¡ªthe white one.\n \"Greetings, brother,\" Edgar said warmly.\n The Finn looked at him with big round eyes. A cautious look.\n \"We are Dark Ones,\" Edgar went on quietly. \"We don\u0027t abandon our own. I\u0027ve been sent to protect you, if necessary. And we\u0027ll be able to defend you at the Tribunal¡ªtrust me. So hold your heads high, servants of the Darkness. Our hour will come very soon now.\"\n Having said that, Edgar got up and went back to his place without looking back even once.\n There. Now let them rack their brains over that.\n How dramatic he had been! He\u0027d really had to work hard to keep a solemn, stony face and avoid cracking a smile. But the expression in the Finn\u0027s big round eyes had been the opposite of a smile¡ªhe\u0027d been really frightened and worried.\n \"I really shouldn\u0027t have,\" Edgar muttered to himself. \"They\u0027re like children... And I mock them.\"\n Edgar sighed regretfully and opened his magazine. It was a nice short flight to Prague, not like flying to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, for instance. You were there before you knew it, without any other stops on the way or that hellish nightmare of having to sleep in your seat. But then, if you really thought about it, the most convenient form of transport was a Dark portal. Only setting up a portal from Moscow to Prague would be an unjustifiable extravagance. So he had to fly, like ordinary human beings.\n But not quite like ordinary human beings... at least Others didn\u0027t have any problems with tickets. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/day-watch-watch-2/page-15.html","bookId":2624,"book":{"id":2624,"title":"Day Watch (Watch #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Day Watch (Watch, #2) \n Day Watch (Russian: Dnevnoi Dozor, Дневной дозор) is a fantasy novel by Russian authors Sergey Lukyanenko and Vladimir Vasilyev.
