The daughter of a grifting team, Ellie spent her childhood being used as a pawn in her parents\u0027 latest scam. Now she’s much older, wiser and ready to give her con artist life a rest. But returning to the dry desert town of Palm Valley, California means one more temptation than she bargained for – Camden McQueen. Once known as the high school weirdo, Camden is bigger and badder than the boy he used to be and a talented tattoo artist with his own thriving business. Ellie’s counting on Camden still being in love with her but what she’s not counting on is how easily unrequited love can turn into obsession over time. When Camden discovers Ellie’s plan to con him, he makes her a deal she doesn’t dare refuse, but her freedom comes with a price and it’s one that takes both Ellie and Camden down a dangerous road.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sins-needles-the-artists-trilogy-1.jpg","author":"Karina Halle","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/sins-needles-the-artists-trilogy-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:36 PM"}},{"id":80831,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sins-needles-the-artists-trilogy-1/page-39.html","bookId":2732,"book":{"id":2732,"title":"Sins \u0026 Needles (The Artists Trilogy #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Sins \u0026 Needles (The Artists Trilogy #1) \n Ellie Watt is used to starting over.
