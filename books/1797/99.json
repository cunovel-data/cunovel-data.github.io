{"id":80476,"no":99,"title":"Page 99","content":"\"Too right,\" Emerson muttered sympathetically. \"Very indulgent.\"\n \"But enough is enough,\" Jonas continued, his eyes gleaming with righteous indignation. \"I\u0027ve had enough of your nagging and your shrewish behavior. Most of the time, being the gentle, easygoing soul that I am, I try to rise above it. But for the past three days you\u0027ve been impossible to be around. The only time you shut up is when we\u0027re in bed. Unfortunately I can\u0027t keep you in bed twenty-four hours a day. I\u0027m beginning to see why it used to be a man\u0027s goal to keep his woman barefoot and pregnant.\"\n \"Jonas!\" Verity swung her astounded gaze to her father. \"Are you going to let him talk to me like that?\"\n \"Don\u0027t look at me.\" Emerson spread hs hands wide. \"I\u0027m just an innocent bystander.\"\n Jonas went intently toward her. \"You\u0027ve gone too far when you start threatening me with my job. I\u0027ve always given you a day\u0027s work for a day\u0027s pay and you\u0027ve got no legitimate complaints, lady.\"\n Verity took a couple of quick steps backward as she realized belatedly that Jonas was dangerous in this mood. \"Jonas, don\u0027t you dare touch me. You work for me. You\u0027d do well to remember that. You take orders from me. I\u0027m giving you an order right now and you\u0027d better follow it or I\u0027ll... I\u0027ll...\"\n He never paused, just kept striding toward her with a relentless expression on his face.\n For possibly the first time in her entire life, Verity\u0027s nerve broke. She whirled and ran for the safety of her own cabin. She had never seen Jonas in this mood, and age-old feminine instinct warned her that the only safety lay in flight. She would give him a piece of her mind later when he\u0027d had a chance to calm down. She\u0027d chew him up one side and down the other later. She would read him the riot act for his behavior.\n Later.\n When it was safe to go near him again.\n He caught her before she reached the front steps of her cabin. He came up behind her, moving silently, and clamped a hand on one of her shoulders. He spun her around so quickly she lost her balance.\n Before she could regain it, the world turned upside down and she found herself hanging over a broad male shoulder. She pounded on his back.\n \"Jonas, you bastard, I\u0027ll strangle you for this.\"\n \"One of the first things a would-be tyrant ought to learn is not to make threats she can\u0027t back up,\" he advised, striding through the front door of her cabin. \"Machiavelli was very clear on that point.\"\n He set her on her feet, sat down on the nearest chair, and yanked her over his knee.\n \"Jonas, don\u0027t you dare!\"\n Verity couldn\u0027t believe it when the flat of his palm landed heavily on her bottom. The tight jeans she wore provided no protection whatsoever.\n She yelled in outrage and pain, and when the second blow came she tried digging her fingers into his thigh and kicking her legs wildly. He was impervious to her struggles and her angry cries.\n \"Damn you. Damn you, damn you, damn you.\"\n \"Tell me why you\u0027ve been on my case for the past three days,\" Jonas ordered between blows. \"Tell me what the hell I did to deserve the kind of abuse I\u0027ve been getting around here lately.\"\n \"You\u0027re going to leave,\" she accused furiously. \"I know you\u0027re going to leave. It\u0027s just a matter of time.\"\n \"So what are you trying to do? Speed up my departure?\" He smacked her again.\n \"Yes.\" Verity lost her temper completely and dug her fingernails fiercely into his leg. Enough was enough.\n Jonas yelped. \"Ouch! Dammit, you little...\" The blows stopped abruptly. \"You\u0027re trying to get rid of me?\"\n \"I just want to know where I stand. I want you to make some kind of decision. I can\u0027fh\u0027andle not knowing what\u0027s going to happen.\"\n \"Why all the concern about my leaving? You worried about having to \"advertise for more kitchen help?\"\n \"No,\" She shrieked furiously. \"It\u0027s not that. I just want to know how much time I have left with you. I love you, you big, dumb, condottiere bastard.\"\n \"Repeat that,\" he ordered thickly.\n \"I said I love you.\" Verity wriggled off his thighs and wound up kneeling in front of him on the floor. She shoved her disordered hair out of her eyes and glared at him as she got to her feet. \"I realize that fact doesn\u0027t speak well for my intelligence, but that\u0027s the way it is. I can\u0027t seem to help myself. But I have to know when you\u0027ll leave me. I refuse to live in fear from day to day. Can\u0027t you understand that? Maybe I have been pushing you for the past three days. I suppose I was spoiling for a fight. Anything to clear the air.\"\n \"Did it ever occur to you to just ask me flat out what my plans were?\" he roared as he massaged his leg where she had left the imprint of her sharp nails.\n She blinked uncertainly. \"No,\" she admitted softly. \"I guess I didn\u0027t know how to phrase the question. I haven\u0027t had a lot of experience with handling the beginnings and endings of affairs. It\u0027s a hard question to ask, Jonas. Maybe I didn\u0027t want to hear the answer.\"\n \"For a supposedly intelligent woman, you show an amazing amount of stupidity at times. I\u0027m not going anywhere. I happen to like it here in Sequence Springs, Verity Ames. God knows why, given my present conditions of employment, which include everything from low wages to a difficult boss. But we\u0027ll go into that later. Right now we have somethisg else to clear up. You said you loved me?\"\n Verity cleared her throat. \"Well, yes.\" That had sort of tumbled out accidentally in the heat of the moment, she decided. She hadn\u0027t meant to spell it out so plainly. It made her terribly vulnerable and Verity discovered she did not like being vulnerable. Especially not to this man. But she didn\u0027t have much choice.\n Jonas was eyeing her assessingly. \"What is this? You no longer consider me irresponsible, unreliable, and unacceptable?\"\n Verity flushed, her palm going surreptitiously to her stinging rear. \"I know you a lot better now than I did when I first said that. I\u0027d trust you with my life,\" she said simply. \"In fact I already have trusted you with it.\n It\u0027s true you do irritate me from time to time. You\u0027re far too casual about certain matters, including your career. But I know now that if you make a commitment, you\u0027ll fulfill it. If you said you were going to do something, you\u0027d do it.\"\n \"And if I said I intended to stay here in Sequence Springs with you, you\u0027d believe me?\" he asked, his voice gentling.\n She nodded warily, afraid to acknowledge the hope that was building in her heart. \"But I was afraid to ask you for fear you\u0027d tell me you had to leave. If not right away, then soon. I didn\u0027t want to hear it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-99.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
