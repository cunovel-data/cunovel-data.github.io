{"id":80439,"no":61,"title":"Page 61","content":"\"Well, it does appear that way, doesn\u0027t it? Be honest, Jonas. You\u0027ve admitted that the only reason you followed me out of Mexico was because of my connection to your talent. You wouldn\u0027t have hunted me down if you thought the only thing you\u0027d missed that night was a good lay.\"\\n\\n \"I ought to take a belt to your sweet ass, lady. Talk about jumping to conclusions.\" Jonas was infuriated by the fact that part of what she said was absolutely true. He had come after her because of the mystery.\\n\\n And he had made love to her only on the occasions when he\u0027d made a trip into the corridor.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t yell at me, Jonas. I\u0027m just stating facts.\" She smiled wistfully and touched his cheek. \"I don\u0027t want to argue. Not tonight. I\u0027m much too glad to have you here safe. Let\u0027s forget about the facts and all the reasons we got together and just enjoy being together. You\u0027ll go away one of these days and I want to be able to say I took full advantage of my first love affair. After all, given the statistics, I may never have another one.\"\\n\\n Anger mixed with a sudden flare of guilt. \"Why do you say I\u0027ll go away?\"\\n\\n \"Men like you always move on. You\u0027re like Dad. You don\u0027t really want responsibility or long-term commitment. Don\u0027t worry. I knew that going into this affair. I had my eyes wide open. Besides, I\u0027m not looking for marriage anyway. I\u0027ve told.you that, so relax. I\u0027m planning on growing into a bossy, independent, tyrannical old lady. A real shrew. But at least I won\u0027t be an old maid.\"\\n\\n \"Verity, this is getting all mixed up. I don\u0027t think I like being written off as useless in the long run. And I don\u0027t like your assumption that I\u0027m staying here only because of your ability to anchor me when I go into that corridor. Maybe I did follow you initially because of the mystery surrounding you, but there are other factors involved now. This isn\u0027t a simple situation for either of us. Don\u0027t try to make it simple by pigeonholing me or our relationship. And don\u0027t get the idea you can use me as a stud for a while and then discard me when it suits you.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to argue. Not tonight, Jonas.\" Verity slid her leg between his knees. Her skin was creamy smooth against his tough, hairy flesh. Her fingertips drew a small pattern on his thigh. Jonas groaned and swore softly as his body reacted instantly. \"Show me you want me now,\" she whispered. \"Prove to me you don\u0027t have to make another trip into that corridor to work up a desire for me.\"\\n\\n Jonas leaned over her, trapping her teasing legs with his own. He was already hard again. He tested himself against her thigh, letting her know that he was more than ready.\\n\\n \"I already knew you were hell to work for,\" he muttered against her mouth. \"Now it looks like you\u0027re going to be equally demanding in bed. Lucky for you I\u0027m so easygoing, good-natured, and willing to please.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve always heard opposites attract.\"\\n\\n Kincaid looked up impatiently as Hatch walked into the elegantly bare office.\\n\\n \"Well?\" Kincaid asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got the initial background report on both Ames and Quarrel. Ames is not particularly interesting.\\n\\n Nothing more than what she seems, a woman running a little cafe in a small town. But Quarrel is a bit more unusual. He\u0027s got a Ph.D. in history and until five years ago he had a reputation as a consultant for museums and collectors.\"\\n\\n Kincaid frowned. \"What kind of consultant?\"\\n\\n \"He was frequently asked to verify the authenticity of certain items being considered for purchase. Seems he had what some people call the \u0027touch.\u0027 He was never proved wrong. But five years ago he walked away from his teaching job and his consulting work and started drifting. He\u0027s held odd jobs every place from Tahiti to Mexico. Now he\u0027s washing dishes and waiting tables for Ames.\"\\n\\n Kincaid sat silently for a moment, letting the information sink in. \"A dishwasher with a background in museum consulting who has somehow gotten himself invited to Caitlin Evanger\u0027s home. Very interesting.\"\\n\\n \"The investigator made some inquiries at the spa near the restaurant. Ames is good friends with the owners. The investigator got the impression that Evanger is Ames\u0027s friend and that it was she who got the invitation to visit. Apparently Ames just decided to take Quarrel along for the ride.\" Hatch shrugged. \"The report says it\u0027s almost certain he\u0027s her lover.\"\\n\\n \"Were Ames and Evanger friends before Quarrel appeared on the scene?\"\\n\\n Hatch glanced hurriedly through the report. \"No, sir. Doesn\u0027t look that way.\"\\n\\n \"Quite a coincidence that a reclusive artist who has few known social contacts suddenly becomes close friends with a little cafe operator who just happens to have a lover who\u0027s got a background in consulting for museums and collectors.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s more, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Finish it.\" Kincaid swung around to face the view from his window.\\n\\n Hatch cleared his throat. \"It seems that Jonas Quarrel has let it be known in certain circles that he is acting as an agent for an unidentified party who wishes to sell a very valuable set of antique dueling pistols.\"\\n\\n Kincaid steepled his hands. \"Has he contacted any museums?\"\\n\\n \"No. The investigation report says it\u0027s all being handled on the quiet. This is to be a very private sale.\"\\n\\n Kincaid considered. \"I want to talk to this Jonas Quarrel myself. I need an opportunity to size him up.\\n\\n He may be perfectly harmless. But we have to consider the fact that he is close to Evanger, who has a history of not letting anyone from the art world get close to her. We must also consider the possibility that he is somehow involved in the sale of Bloodlust.\"\\n\\n Hatch frowned. \"How?\"\\n\\n Kincaid shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. The most likely scenario is that he\u0027s representing an interested bidder who prefers to remain anonymous. If so, that bidder, whoever he is, obviously has special statusâ€”otherwise his agent, Quarrel, would not be paying private visits to a woman who never invites people to her home. I want to know what I\u0027m facing. I can deal with financial competition, but if there\u0027s something more involved, I need to know about it in advance. I\u0027ll be able to tell a great deal about Quarrel if I can meet him. I might be able to figure out where he fits in to the picture.\"\\n\\n \"I understand,\" Hatch said calmly. He did not like Kincaid, but could not doubt the man\u0027s ability to assess the motives and weaknesses of others. That skill was one of the many that had brought Kincaid this far. \"What do you want me to do?\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s try the easy way first. Advise him discreetly that you\u0027ve heard rumors of the availability of the pistols and that you represent a collector who\u0027s interested in them. Let him know that money is no object and that your collector certainly won\u0027t ask any awkward questions concerning the provenance of the pistols. See if he takes the bait. If he does, invite him to see me here in my office.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-61.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \\n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
