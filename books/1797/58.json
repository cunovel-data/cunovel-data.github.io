{"id":80436,"no":58,"title":"Page 58","content":"\"I can believe it.\" Verity\u0027s fingers tightened comfortingly through his. \"My God, I can believe it.\"\\n\\n Jonas felt the gentle warmth in her touch and smiled to himself. He was supposed to be the one doing the comforting tonight. Underneath all those prickly thorns there was a decidedly soft, empathic streak in his flame-haired tyrant. Knowing that made him feel more protective and possessive than ever. No wonder Emerson had felt obliged to give her as many self-defense mechanisms as possible. She would never admit it, but Verity needed protection in this hard, cold world.\\n\\n \"That first time I found you in the corridor with me I reached for you and you ran,\" Jonas explained slowly.\\n\\n \"I dropped the pistol and that was the end of it. I still wasn\u0027t sure what it meant, but I knew I had to find out.\"\\n\\n \"And the next time you found me there?\" she prompted.\\n\\n \"When it happened last night at Evanger\u0027s house, things were a lot more serious.\"\\n\\n \"Because that rapier was from the era you\u0027re so attuned to?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"It\u0027s a much more dangerous time zone for me and I was really caught up in it last night. I made a mistake. I took a chance and I paid for it. I knew I had to get to you before I was completely overwhelmed by the forces that were attached to the rapier.\"\\n\\n \"So you came traipsing down the hall to my room.\"\\n\\n \"I went after you because I sensed you could keep me from being swamped. I was right. At first you ran, but at the last moment you stopped and turned around and came to me. Once you were with me I was back in command of myself. It was close but we got through it together. Last night I had my proof.\\n\\n Tonight was a controlled exploratory trip. Now I\u0027m convinced. With you around, I can learn to control my trips into the corridor. Do you have any idea what that means to me, Verity?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure I want to know,\" she retorted gloomily..\\n\\n He ignored that. \"The rapier I had last night, or anything else from that era, is not a good test object because it\u0027s too powerful. The pistols were much easier to experiment with. They\u0027re infinitely more manageable.\"\\n\\n \"Hah. Manageable my foot. Two men were getting ready to kill each other in that corridor. I couldn\u0027t see very well, the image was all broken up like an Impressionist painting, but I got the overall picture.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never seen such a clear image in that corridor,\" Jonas mused. \"But then I\u0027ve never had the luxury of taking my time and studying what was going on around me. Every other time I\u0027ve gone in, I\u0027ve been moving fast, trying to avoid too much contact with those twisting streamer things. It was interesting to be able to stop for once and look around.\"\\n\\n \"What would have happened if that other man had fired?\"\\n\\n Jonas shrugged. \"Nothing. What could have happened? It\u0027s like watching a movie. The images never last more than a few seconds.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure that the images are harmless. I got the impression you were somehow being drawn into one of the men holding a gun. Does that make sense?\"\\n\\n \"In a way, I guess. I was feeling what he was feeling. I knew things he knew, such as why he was fighting the duel. But there was no danger. I wasn\u0027t him. He wasn\u0027t me.\"\\n\\n \"I was frightened, Jonas. I thought that if the other man fired, you might actually be killed.\"\\n\\n Jonas stopped short in the middle of the path. \"What the hell are you saying?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t explain it. I just had this fleeting feeling that you were in as much danger as the man who was holding the pistol in that image. That\u0027s why I started yelling about getting out of the corridor. You called me Amanda and dropped the pistol and the next thing I knew we were out of there.\" She shivered. \"You shouldn\u0027t have touched that golden ribbon.\"\\n\\n Jonas felt a prickle of cold sweat. He banished the queasy feeling at once. \"Verity, your imagination got away with you. Perfectly understandable. After all, that was the first time you were ever caught up in one of those corridor situations. You don\u0027t realize how easily corridor reality gets mixed up with present-time reality. Don\u0027t worry about it. We were both safe.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure about that.\"\\n\\n \"Trust me,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve had a lot more experience in that corridor than you\u0027ve had. It can be dangerous. In the past I\u0027ve worried about being swamped by the lingering emotions of someone who lived in the past, but tonight I felt totally in control. Damn, it felt good.\" A joyous relief that could no longer be suppressed made him laugh out loud. \"It was a fantastic sensation, Verity. Incredible. For the first time I was in command in that corridor. I knew I didn\u0027t have to worry about fighting off any garbage from the past. I was stronger than anything the residue off that pistol could throw at me.\\n\\n Dammit to hell, what a feeling of freedom. After all these years, I finally feel free, and I owe it all to you, lady.\"\\n\\n \"If you want to pay your debt, take me to bed,\" she said fiercely.\\n\\n Jonas was so startled that for an instant he could only stare down at her in amazement. \"What?\" he finally got out.\\n\\n Her eyes were deep, mysterious pools in the shadows as she looked up at him. \"Take me to bed. Now.\\n\\n Right this minute.\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you rather talk some more? You had a hell of an experience tonight. Maybe you\u0027d rather we discussed it. I can answer some of your questions. Not all of them, but a few. You must have thousands, considering what you\u0027ve been through.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not listening to me. The questions can wait. I want to make love first. Right away.\"\\n\\n \"Uh, sure. You bet. My pleasure. I\u0027ve been thinking along those lines myself. I mean, I\u0027ve been wondering if you would be willing, but I thought I ought to give you a little time to...\" He broke off, certain he had turned into a gibbering idiot. \"Lady, sometimes you really take me by surprise.\"\\n\\n She put her arms around his neck and pressed close. He could feel the firm roundness of her small br**sts against him as she rose onto her toes and forcefully pulled his head down to hers. He could feel her ni**les hardening beneath the pullover she wore.\\n\\n \"When did you stop wearing a bra?\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"Never mind that. Kiss me,\" she urged passionately.\\n\\n Jonas caught his breath, aware of the hot rush of blood in his veins. \"Your wish is my command,\" he tried to say with a small, mockingly gallant smile, but he never finished the sentence.\\n\\n Verity was assaulting his mouth while she pressed her body against him. Her lips were hot and demanding on his. When she thrust her small tongue between his teeth, Jonas\u0027s already aroused body kicked into high gear. He was suddenly throbbing with desire, as frantic for Verity as she was for him. The knowledge that she wanted him with such demanding urgency had much the same effect as pouring gasoline on open flames. Jonas nearly exploded. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-58.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \\n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
