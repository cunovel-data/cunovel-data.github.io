{"id":80382,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Quarrel\u0027s eyes gleamed as he looked down at her. For some reason the image of a gilded rapier hilt popped into her mind. Florentine gold beautifully etched on the handle of a blade meant to kill.\\n\\n \"As it happens,\" he explained in his low, shaded voice, \"I\u0027m looking for indoor work.\"\\n\\n Verity began to panic. Something was very wrong here and she was no longer sure she could deal with the situation. The man didn\u0027t actually frighten her, for all his quiet power, perhaps because she sensed that that power was very controlled. But Verity was also certain this was no casual laborer willing to eke out a living at minimum wage. There was too much intelligence in those gold eyes, too much hooded awareness of both himself and the world around him. But the factor that alarmed her the most was her own too-vivid awareness of him. She struggled to suppress it. This man was dangerous. She knew it intuitively in a way she could never have explained with words.\\n\\n It was becoming obvious that Jonas Quarrel wasn\u0027t going to take no for an answer, however. She would have to find a more subtle way to get rid of him.\\n\\n \"I presume you have a resume?\" Verity asked in a quelling tone.\\n\\n \"A resume?\" He eyed her thoughtfully. \"For a dishwashing job?\"\\n\\n She was onto something, Verity decided in relief. Obviously he did not have a resume.\\n\\n \"Well, naturally. You can\u0027t expect me to just hire you on the spot. I\u0027ll need a complete work and education history, including dates of previous employment, names of supervisors, addresses and phone numbers.\\n\\n You\u0027ll have to fill out an employment application, too. I\u0027ll add it to the stack I\u0027m collecting. When I have a lot of them I\u0027ll go through them all and make my selection.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like a lengthy process,\" Quarrel observed dryly.\\n\\n \"Oh, it is,\" she agreed quickly. \"Might take a couple of weeks or more.\"\\n\\n \"Is that right? What are you going to do for help this weekend?\"\\n\\n Verity froze. \"I beg your pardon?\"\\n\\n \"You heard me. You need help now. Tonight, in fact. You\u0027re going to be swamped in a few hours.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll make do,\" Verity said through clenched teeth. \"The managers of the Sequence Springs Spa are friends. I used to run their restaurant. They\u0027ll be glad to loan me someone from their kitchen.\"\\n\\n \"Why borrow temporary help when you\u0027ve got an opportunity to hire the best on a more permanent basis?\"\\n\\n Verity\u0027s hand tightened on the doorknob. \"I had no idea dishwashers took so much pride in their craft. You consider yourself the best, Mr. Quarrel?\"\\n\\n \"Trust me,\" he said blandly. \"I\u0027ve got more experience and skill in the art of dishwashing and waiting on customers than anyone else who\u0027s likely to show up on your doorstep between now and five-thirty tonight.\"\\n\\n \"What about your handyperson experience?\" she demanded, beginning to feel as if she were getting backed into a corner. Time was wasting. She needed to get back to the kitchen.\\n\\n \"i\u0027ra very handy to have around,\" he assured her. \"I\u0027m capable of just about anything from unstopping a toilet to bouncing a drunk. You\u0027ll see. I\u0027m useful.\"\\n\\n Verity straightened her shoulders. \"I only have a beer and wine license. We do not have a problem with drunks here at the No Bull. Furthermore, I have a plumber I can call if something goes wrong in the restrooms. I don\u0027t know what sort of establishments you\u0027ve worked in before, but it sounds as if your job skills might be better used down at the local tavern. Why don\u0027t you try there? I\u0027ll give you the owner\u0027s name.\" Milt Sanderson, who owned The Keg, could deal with this man, she thought. Milt was used to dealing with construction workers, truckdrivers, and similar types.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather work here,\" Jonas said simply.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Verity demanded boldly.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s just say I\u0027m anxious to improve my lot in the world. I\u0027ve got ambition.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. Let\u0027s just say you try another restaurant, Mr. Quarrel. Don\u0027t bother coming back here until you have a proper resume.\" Verity made another attempt to close the door.\\n\\n \"Not so fast, Ms. Equal Opportunity Employer.\"\\n\\n He was in the room with her before Verity quite knew what had happened. Instinctively she backed up a step. She had to get control of this situation. It was getting ludicrously out-of-hand. \"Now just hold on a minute. The restaurant is closed, I\u0027ve told you that. I have a million things to do before I open for the dinner crowd and I haven\u0027t got time to waste calling the police. Kindly take yourself out of here.\"\\n\\n \"A job applicant has to demonstrate perseverance. Employers respond to that. They\u0027re impressed by it.\"\\n\\n Quarrel glanced around the dining room. \"Have you got an office?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but I don\u0027t see what that has to do with anything. Mr. Quarrel, I would appreciate it if you would...\"\\n\\n \"Through here, right?\" He was already making his way between the maze of country French chairs and small, intimate tables toward the kitchen.\\n\\n Verity\u0027s temper overcame her incipient nervousness. \"What do you think you\u0027re doing?\" She leaped after him.\\n\\n \"You want a resume? I\u0027ll give you a resume.\" He paced through the small tiled kitchen, past the large gas stove, the immaculately clean stainless steel counters and the sink, which was still full of dishes from the lunch crowd. Quarrel gave the sink a knowing glance. \"Looks like you need me, lady.\" Then he was at the door of her tiny office. \"Ah, just as I thought. A typewriter.\"\\n\\n Verity stared at his sleek shoulders and back as he dropped down into the chair at her desk, reached for a sheet of typing paper, and inserted it into the machine. \"You\u0027re going to type out a resume? Right here in my office?\"\\n\\n \"Right. Now go putter around in the kitchen and stop nagging me while I work on this. It\u0027s going to take a little concentration. Been a while since I had to put a resume together. Christ. A resume to wash dishes.\\n\\n What\u0027s the world coming to?\" He was already flexing his fingers over the keys.\\n\\n Short of calling the police, Verity was unable to think of anything else to do. She found herself looking at his hands as he began typing with quick, deft strokes. He had fascinating hands, she thought. Long, supple fingers and strong-looking wrists. A swordsman\u0027s hands.\\n\\n A lover\u0027s hands.\\n\\n That last impression made her frown. She stepped back out of the office and headed for the kitchen, trying to decide what to do next. This whole situation was bizarre. She didn\u0027t feel personally threatened, but she did feel astonishingly helpless.\\n\\n Maybe the poor man really was desperate for a job; any job. Verity picked up the bottle of olive oil and went back to the torteilini salad she had been making. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-3.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \\n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
