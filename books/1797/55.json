{"id":80433,"no":55,"title":"Page 55","content":"The three of them sat in companionable silence for a few minutes, absorbing the faint sound of the murmuring trees and the sight of the lake in sunshine. Neither Jonas nor Emerson seemed inclined to start a conversation so Verity waited until she\u0027d fortified herself with a few swallows of beer before she took the initiative.\\n\\n \"Well, Jonas, have you told Dad about the test you want to run with the pistols?\"\\n\\n Jonas shrugged. \"I told him.\"\\n\\n Verity looked at her father. \"What do you think, Dad?\"\\n\\n Emerson rubbed the back of his neck. \"About what?\"\\n\\n \"About this psychometry business,\" she said bluntly, not looking at Jonas. \"Do you believe in it?\"\\n\\n \"Red, I believe in a lot of things I can\u0027t see or taste or touch. Things like black holes in the heart of the universe, and the Theory of Relativity. I\u0027m willing to keep an open mind toward this psychic stuff. If Jonas says he\u0027s got some kind of talent for it, I\u0027m willing to wait and see.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know anything about psychometry?\" Verity demanded.\\n\\n Emerson raised a heavy brow. \"I know that any really good collector, antique dealer, or museum director will tell you he\u0027s heard stories of people in his line of work who just seem to \u0027know\u0027 when an object is genuine. It\u0027s usually passed off as some kind of intuition based on extensive experience, a gut feel for what\u0027s real and what\u0027s not. But who knows? It could be the rudiments of psychometry. And if it is, it makes sense to think that a few people might have been born with more than just some rudimentary talent. A few might have gotten the full-blown power. Like I said, I\u0027m keeping an open mind. What about you?\"\\n\\n Verity glanced at Jonas, who had his dark head resting against the post. His eyes were closed and he seemed not to be paying any attention to the conversation.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m keeping an open mind, too,\" Verity said.\\n\\n Jonas spoke without opening his eyes. \"If you believe that, Emerson, I\u0027ve got some oceanfront property down in Arizona I\u0027d like to sell you.\"\\n\\n Emerson chuckled. \"I guess we\u0027ll find out a little more about all this when you two run this test, huh?\\n\\n If nothing else, it should be amusing. I always enjoy a good party trick.\"\\n\\n \"Did Jonas tell you that the last time he practiced his party trick someone almost got killed?\" Verity sensed Jonas\u0027s sudden, deep stillness.\\n\\n \"Just a lab tech, from what I hear.\" Emerson was unconcerned. \"In this day and age lab techs are as common as white mice. What\u0027s one more or less?\"\\n\\n \"Dad!\"\\n\\n Emerson grinned. \"Just teasing, Red.\" He reached for a fresh can of beer. \"When are you planning to do your stuff, Jonas? I want to be around. Wouldn\u0027t want anything to happen to those pistols.\"\\n\\n \"The pistols will be safe enough,\" Jonas said calmly.\\n\\n \"Do I get the same guarantee about Verity?\" Emerson asked blandly.\\n\\n \"Verity will be perfectly safe,\" Jonas said quietly.\\n\\n \"Of course I\u0027ll be safe,\" she tossed back, irritated. \"What can possibly happen to me, even if Jonas is right about having this weird power?\"\\n\\n Jonas opened one eye and regarded her thoughtfully. \"I\u0027ll tell you what might happen to you, little tyrant.\\n\\n One of these days I\u0027m going to catch you in that corridor and I might not let you go again. When we\u0027re in that corridor, I\u0027m the one in charge. You work for me there.\"\\n\\n Verity swallowed too much beer and nearly choked. By the time she had recovered, Jonas and Emerson had casually decided when to run the test.\\n\\n \"Tonight after Verity closes the restaurant will be a good time,\" Jonas said. \"She\u0027s usually exhausted after the evening cleanup. With any luck she\u0027ll be too tired to fight me when I try to make the connection.\"\\n\\n Verity shot him a quick, repressive glare. He was talking about a psychic connection, but it struck her for the first time that the only occasions she had ever actually wound up in bed with Jonas were after she had seen him in that mysterious corridor.\\n\\n She spent the rest of the evening wondering if there was some link between the psychic events Jonas claimed to experience and his passion afterward.\\n\\n It was an unsettling thought.\\n\\n The No Bull Cafe closed a half-hour early on Tuesday night. Business had been light during the evening and Jonas and Emerson got the cleanup work done in record time. Verity found herself loitering behind them, double-checking lists and going over small details she already knew by heart.\\n\\n \"Ready, Verity?\"\\n\\n She jumped as Jonas approached her from behind. She glanced back over her shoulder and met his steady gaze. \"I guess so. As ready as I\u0027ll ever be.\"\\n\\n His expression hardened slightly. \"You don\u0027t have to look as though I\u0027ve just invited you to a funeral.\\n\\n This will only take a few minutes. When it\u0027s over maybe I\u0027ll have some answers to some questions I\u0027ve been living with for a long time.\"\\n\\n Verity\u0027s resentment flickered and died. Jonas believed in this mysterious talent he claimed he had. Right or wrong, it was eating at him and had been for years. Apparently it had shaped a good portion of his adult life. She couldn\u0027t deny him her help in this small test.\\n\\n Impulsively she reached out and took his hand. \"Okay, let\u0027s go see what happens.\"\\n\\n Jonas\u0027s eyes lightened and his strong fingers clamped fiercely around hers. \"Thanks, Verity. One of these days I\u0027ll repay you for the favor, I promise.\"\\n\\n \"Forget it. Consider it a job perk. Given the low wages I pay, I suppose you deserve one or two.\" Such as sleeping with the boss and playing strange psychic games with her. \"Ready, Dad?\"\\n\\n Emerson, who was leaning against a counter, his arms folded across his broad chest, nodded briefly.\\n\\n Teeth flashed somewhere in his beard. \"Let\u0027s go see what happens.\"\\n\\n They locked the restaurant and walked along the path to the small cabin. When they filed inside and closed the door, Emerson reached under the sagging bed to pull out the pistol case. He opened it and set it down on a table. Verity thought the old guns looked sinister in the harsh light of the ancient bulb overhead. But then, she always thought guns of any kind or any age appeared sinister and quite repugnant.\\n\\n \"What do we do next, Jonas?\" she asked calmly.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to do anything except sit down in that chair and try not to fight me or run from me.\"\\n\\n He indicated one of the straight-back chairs at the table.\\n\\n Verity frowned as she slipped onto the seat. \"I\u0027m not going to fight you. I agreed to do this, remember?\"\\n\\n He nodded, sitting down across from her. \"I know, but your instincts may take a different viewpoint when they sense what\u0027s happening. On the other two occasions when I tried to connect with you in that corridor, you were terrified.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-55.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \\n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
