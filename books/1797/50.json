If there is such a thing as infinity,\" he added thoughtfully. \"Personally, I\u0027m not so sure there is. At least not on the continuum that links time and space. Maybe there are other continuums that are truly infinite. Or maybe each universe is finite but the potential for the creation of universes is infinite. Or maybe time isn\u0027t on a continuum at all. Maybe it\u0027s more like a foggy sea surrounding us. Or there could be millions of time continuums all existing simultaneously. ...\"\n \"Jonas, you\u0027re losing me rapidly,\" Verity said with a quiet desperation.\n \"No, I\u0027m not. You told me yourself you had an excellent education. You just don\u0027t want to hear what I\u0027m going to say. But you\u0027re going to listen, Verity.\" The ancient gold of his eyes burned for an instant.\n \"There\u0027s not much else you can do. After all, like it or not, you\u0027re trapped in this car with a crazy man who just happens to be your lover.\"\n Verity flinched. His sardonic remark was far too close to what she had been thinking earlier that morning as she descended the steel staircase. If Jonas was getting to know her well enough to second-guess her thoughts, she was in real trouble. \"I never said you were crazy and two nights of sex does not automatically make you my lover. At this point you don\u0027t qualify as anything more than an occasional bed partner.\"\n \"Your only occasional bed partner.\" His long fingers tightened on the wheel. \"Tell me something, Verity.\n Are you using me?\"\n \"Using you! What a thing to say! If anyone\u0027s using someone in this relationship of ours, it\u0027s you.\"\n \"I\u0027m not so sure about that. I\u0027ve been wondering why, after twenty-eight years of sleeping alone, you suddenly decided to let me into your bed.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t exactly let you into bed,\" she pointed out carefully. \"You sort of muscled your way in.\"\n \"Bullshit. You let me in. You wanted me there. Don\u0027t you dare imply there was any rape involved, Verity Ames, or so help me, I\u0027ll turn you over my knee.\"\n \"Threats now, Jonas?\" she asked in taunting, liquid tones.\n \"You bet your sweet little ass. Now answer my question. Are you using me? I have a right to know just what the basis of this relationship is.\"\n His arrogance was breathtaking. \"Don\u0027t be absurd. How would I be using you?\"\n \"As an experiment,\" he said succinctly.\n \"An experiment!\"\n \"Sure. I\u0027ve been the subject of enough experiments in my life to know a setup when I see one. It makes a nasty kind of sense. After all, you\u0027re looking at thirty on the horizon and there\u0027s no relationship in sight.\n Hell, there\u0027s not even a man in sight for a weekend fling. You were a little too picky for a little too long, I guess. Either that or you flayed every man in sight with that sharp tongue. Whatever the reason, you find yourself alone facing spinsterhood. You\u0027re a naturally passionate woman who\u0027s denied herself an outlet for her sensual needs for too long. You begin to wonder if you\u0027ll ever experience sex or have a genuine affair. It\u0027s only natural that you might be getting desperate as you see an important aspect of life passing you by.\"\n Verity was incensed. Her hands closed into small fists. \"I am not desperate. I may be picky but I am not desperate.\"\n \"What woman wouldn\u0027t be desperate in your situation?\"\n \"You egotistical, chauvinistic bastard!\"\n \"I\u0027m just trying to get at the truth. I want to know if you decided to experiment with me. I want to know if you\u0027re using me to get a taste of what you\u0027ve been missing all these years. After all, I\u0027m convenient, there\u0027s an attraction between us, and I\u0027m willing. What\u0027s more, the relationship probably feels safe to you because you think that ultimately you\u0027re in control of it. Hell, I work for you. How much more in control could you get? You can always fire me if I start boring you in bed.\n \"My lady thinks she will command the dance\n She calls the tune and dictates every measure.\n I tread the steps, ensnared with every beat,\n While she sips the rich dark wine of pleasure.\"\n Verity wrinkled her nose. \"Another rough translation of some Renaissance poem?\"\n \"Yeah. Some courtier\u0027s humble ode to his beloved who kept him dancing on the end of her string.\n Translating poetry is not my forte, but you get the point. I\u0027m like the poor courtier who ended up dancing to his beloved\u0027s tune.\"\n \"Somehow, I don\u0027t see you playing the humble courtier, Jonas. If you do occasionally, it\u0027s for your own purposes. If we\u0027re going to use Renaissance imagery, I would have to say you\u0027re more of a condottiere who\u0027s busy with his own schemes and plans while he pretends to be working for a client.\"\n Jonas\u0027s mouth tightened.\"You haven\u0027t answered my question.\"\n \"About whether I\u0027m using you? Experimenting on you? Never mind. It will give you something to think about while I\u0027m wondering why I\u0027m allowing a crazy man to continue washing dishes for me.\"\n There was a frozen silence from the other side of the car and then Jonas asked in a too-neutral voice,\n \"Do you really think I\u0027m off my rocker?\"\n Verity caught her lower lip between her teeth and gnawed painfully for a moment. \"No,\" she said finally, thinking of what she had seen in his golden eyes.\n She had seen humor in that gaze as well as intelligence, passion, and anger. She had never seen anything that made her wonder if he was mentally unstable. She had never sensed anything in him that made her think he was dangerously out of control.\n \"Thanks for that much, at any rate.\"\n \"Tell me about this... this corridor,\" she ordered tightly.\n His expression gentled as he looked at her. Jonas took one hand off the wheel long enough to squeeze her clenched fingers. His touch was warm and comforting. \"Don\u0027t be afraid, honey. Whenever you\u0027re in the corridor, I\u0027ll be there with you. What can scare the living hell out of someone is finding himself alone there, not knowing what\u0027s ahead or behind.\"\n Verity looked at him with wide, uncertain eyes. \"You see yourself in a corridor whenever you go into one of your trances or whatever you call the condition you were in last night?\"\n Jonas nodded once. \"A long, dark tunnel, like a tube that connects the past and the present. I didn\u0027t know if, when you joined me there, you would see the same thing, but apparently you do. That should help, Verity. It gives us a point of reference. The experience is similar enough for both of us that we should be able to share certain aspects of it.\"\n Verity searched frantically for some logical explanation. \"Maybe you\u0027re telepathic or something. Maybe that corridor is a construction you\u0027ve invented in your own mind and you can somehow make me see it, too. Maybe this has nothing to do with psychometry.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-50.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
