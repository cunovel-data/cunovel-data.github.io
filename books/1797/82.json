{"id":80460,"no":82,"title":"Page 82","content":"\"I also don\u0027t like the way this friendship between the two of you materialized out of nowhere a few weeks before she planned her grand scheme. And I don\u0027t like the way Kincaid found out about us.\\n\\n And I don\u0027t like the way that joker in the camouflage shirt showed up at the cabin with a gun. There are a lot of things I don\u0027t like about this scene, but most of all I don\u0027t like the fact that I can\u0027t talk you into leaving right now.\"\\n\\n \"Jonas, I would if I could. But I can\u0027t walk out on her. She needs me. She said so.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s got Tavi. Apparently that\u0027s the only person she\u0027s needed until now.\" Jonas saw the stubbornness in Verity\u0027s face and gave up the battle he knew he could not win. He tightened his hold on her and swung her around so that her blue velvet skirts shimmered in the soft light. \"Oh, hell, forget it. We\u0027re here and it\u0027s going to be over soon. We\u0027ll stick it out and hope like the devil that Evanger knows what she\u0027s doing. In the meantime, I don\u0027t want you leaving this crowd unless I\u0027m with you. Got that?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m in any danger?\" she asked, clearly amazed by the notion.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what to think,\" he admitted. \"So I\u0027m not taking any chances.\" A movement in the arched doorway caught his eye. \"Damn. There\u0027s Kincaid now. So much for hoping he would short-circuit things by not showing up.\"\\n\\n Kincaid had chosen to wear a plum-colored tunic over a white shirt and tights similar to the ones Jonas had on. Jonas wondered if Kincaid found them as uncomfortable as he did. Gave a man a whole new perspective on pantyhose. Still, the tights were remarkably flexible, he had to admit. There was a great deal of freedom of movement. A man could fight in a tunic and tights. That would have been an important consideration for Renaissance male fashion designers.\\n\\n \"Kincaid? Where?\" Verity tried to turn here head so that she could see him.\\n\\n \"Christ, don\u0027t stare at the man,\" Jonas ordered, exasperated by her too-obvious fascination. \u0027The last thing I want to do is attract his attention. Whatever is going to happen here is between him and Evanger and I don\u0027t want you any more involved than you already are.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s bound to see us sooner or later. The crowd is large, but not large enough to hide us.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027re not going to make things easier by going over and saying hi.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay. Sometimes you can be very short-tempered and difficult, Jonas. Has anyone ever pointed that out to you?\"\\n\\n \"You have. All the time. Part of your duty as a shrew, I guess.\" He dropped his arm from her waist and propelled her toward the buffet table. \"Let\u0027s get something to eat, my lady.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder what Caitlin\u0027s thinking now.\" Verity managed a swift glance at the artist, who was holding court on the other side of the room.\\n\\n Jonas followed her gaze, his eyes narrowed in thought. Caitlin Evanger was certainly dressed for her role as a mistress of a Renaissance court salon tonight, he had to admit. Of all the people present, she was the only one who wasn\u0027t wearing a rented costume. Her dress appeared to have been handmade for her.\\n\\n The gold-brocaded gown exposed a magnificent expanse of flesh above Caitlin\u0027s full br**sts, far more skin than he would have allowed Verity to expose, Jonas decided. The huge, puffed sleeves were slashed to reveal red silk under-sleeves. Evanger\u0027s short-cropped hair was hidden beneath a delicate, jewel-studded cap that had a long gold silk scarf attached. The scarf shimmered down the length of her back whenever she turned her head,\\n\\n \"Do you think he might recognize her?\" Verity asked curiously.\\n\\n \"She said he wouldn\u0027t. She said she changed a lot after the accident, remember?\"\\n\\n \"I know, but how could any man forget the face of a woman he had abused like that?\"\\n\\n Jonas didn\u0027t reply to that. He was in no mood to try to explain a man like Kincaid to Verity. He didn\u0027t want to tell her that he had met a number of men who saw women only as objects of lust and that five or ten years after that lust had been satisfied, they would not remember either the woman\u0027s face or the satisfaction they had taken from her. Jonas didn\u0027t want to listen to another lecture on the evil tendencies of his own sex. He was familiar enough with them.\\n\\n \"Have some of this vegetable pat6,\" he ordered, smearing the green concoction on a triangle of toast.\\n\\n Verity glanced at him, eyes worried, her lips parting to say something. Jonas took the opportunity to slip the toast between her teeth, effectively silencing her. It was easier than trying to answer any of her questions.\\n\\n \"Caitlin just saw him,\" Verity whispered around the pate\\ \"Look at her. She\u0027s as tense as a bowstring.\"\\n\\n \"So are you. Calm down. This is her show.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m scared, Jonas.\"\\n\\n \"This is a fine time to decide to get scared. Why didn\u0027t you get nervous this afternoon when I was ready to pack and leave?\"\\n\\n \"I mean, I\u0027m scared for Caitlin, not for myself. Why should I be frightened personally?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Jonas admitted, aware of the discordant stirring of a few primitive instincts somewhere deep inside himself. \"But if it makes you feel any better, I don\u0027t feel normal, either. Something\u0027s going on here.\" He watched intently as Kincaid made his way leisurely through the crowd to greet Caitlin. Caitlin greeted him with stiff formality but there was no sign of recognition from Kincaid. After the barest of introductions, Caitlin deliberately turned her back on Kincaid, who appeared unconcerned by the brush-off.\\n\\n \"Something more than what Caitlin told us?\" Verity asked with unexpected shrewdness.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s possible. It\u0027s equally possible she\u0027s been honest with us but that she\u0027s made the mistake of underestimating her enemy. God knows she wouldn\u0027t be the first one in history to have done that.\"\\n\\n Verity chewed on her lower lip. \"Now you\u0027ve really got me worried, Jonas. What if Kincaid has guessed he\u0027s being set up?\"\\n\\n \"If Kincaid had any inkling of what was meant to happen tonight, I wouldn\u0027t give two cents for Caitlin\u0027s chances of getting her vengeance. In fact, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d give two cents for her life.\"\\n\\n \"Jonas!\"\\n\\n Jonas ignored her small, choked cry. He tracked Kincaid\u0027s progress through the room, watching as the man moved graciously through the crowd, greeting acquaintances and introducing himself to others. He was a man completely in command of himself. A Borgia who had total confidence in his power. Jonas decided that if Kincaid had guessed what was meant to happen, Caitlin Evanger didn\u0027t stand a chance.\\n\\n \"Something tells me he knows something\u0027s up, Verity. He\u0027s too smart and too powerful to be taken unawares. Caitlin is a fool.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-82.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \\n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
