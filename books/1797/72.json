What\u0027s the point? You can\u0027t collect from a dead man.\"\\n\\n Emerson shrugged. \"He probably wasn\u0027t sent to kill me. He probably had orders to impress me with a display of mayhem.\"\\n\\n \"Why the gun?\" Verity snapped.\\n\\n \"A man who makes his living as a collection agent for a loan shark doesn\u0027t run around unarmed,\" Jonas pointed out dryly. \"The gun was probably for effect. But when he realized there were two people in the cabin he panicked. He didn\u0027t know what he was up against, so he decided to shoot first and ask questions later.\"\\n\\n Verity shook her head despairingly. \"Why didn\u0027t you say something about this to the deputies? Why let them think the man was just some unknown thief? What will happen when the guy wakes up and starts talking?\"\\n\\n Jonas rubbed the back of his neck with a weary gesture. \"Probably not much. Why should he say anything? His boss has undoubtedly issued standing orders to his collection agents about what to do if they get picked up, and those orders probably cover such issues as keeping their mouths shut until a lawyer arrives to take over.\"\\n\\n Verity glared at her father. \"And I suppose you don\u0027t want to say anything because it will open up a can of worms. You\u0027ll have to explain about the gambling debt, the man who gave you the pistols, the deal that was made for the pistols, which, it just occurs to me, did not include California State sales tax, and heaven knows what else.\"\\n\\n Emerson sighed. \"Like you said, Red, a can of worms. I can handle it if it\u0027s necessary, but I\u0027d just as soon not go into all the fine nuances of the thing if it can be avoided.\"\\n\\n Verity came to a halt and confronted both men with her hands planted on her hips. \"This is an inexcusable debacle. You both realize that, don\u0027t you? It\u0027s crazy and it\u0027s stupid and it\u0027s dangerous. Not to mention shady to the point of being illegal. And none of it would have happened, Dad, if you\u0027d had the common sense to avoid a piece of lowlife like that damn loan shark Yarington.\"\\n\\n \"I know, Red.\" Emerson gave her a woeful-eyed spaniel look that didn\u0027t fool Verity for a minute.\\n\\n She swung her attention to Jonas. \"As for you, do you have any idea what could have happened here tonight? You and my father might both have been killed. Instead, you nearly killed a man, and there you sit, calm as can be, drinking vodka and acting as if nothing out of the ordinary has occurred.\"\\n\\n Jonas shifted uneasily in his chair. \"Now take it easy, honey. I know you\u0027re a little upset about all this....\"\\n\\n \"A little upset? You and my father nearly get blown away by some hit man who works for a mobster, I find you with your knife stuck in a man\u0027s chest, you make me a party to the deception you\u0027re perpetrating on the authorities, and then you have the nerve to tell me not to get upset? Are you out of your mind, Jonas, or just totally insensitive?\"\\n\\n \"Now, Red,\" Emerson began soothingly.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you \u0027now, Red\u0027 me,\" Verity hissed. \"I\u0027ve had as much as I can take for one evening. While the two of you celebrate your machismo, I\u0027m going home to see if I can get any sleep at all before morning.\\n\\n Unlike certain members of the assembled company, I have a legitimate business to run and I need my rest. The two of you go right ahead and enjoy your vodka. I\u0027m sure you have a lot to hash over. You\u0027ve certainly got enough in common to keep a conversation going for the rest of the night.\" She spun around and slammed the cabin door behind her.\\n\\n There was a long silence in the small cottage after Verity\u0027s noisy departure. Jonas stared broodingly at the closed door, his fingers locked around the small glass of vodka. On the other side of the table Emerson sighed again and took a healthy swallow of his drink, draining the glass in the process. He reached for the bottle.\\n\\n \"She always did have a bit of a temper,\" Emerson said apologetically. \"Tends to be assertive.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve noticed.\"\\n\\n \"My fault. I raised her to speak her mind.\" He brightened. \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" he advised more cheerfully. \"She\u0027ll calm down and come around. She always does. You\u0027ll see.\"\\n\\n \"Wishful thinking,\" Jonas said. \"Did you see the look on her face when she saw my knife in that jerk\u0027s chest? She looked like she\u0027d seen a ghost.\"\\n\\n \"Verity doesn\u0027t approve of violence,\" Emerson explained carefully. \"Maybe I accidentally exposed her to a little too much of the rough side of life while she was growing up. I tried to protect her from the really bad stuff, but you know how it is in some of the more interesting places around the world. And besides, I didn\u0027t want to be overprotective. She witnessed her share of barroom brawls and once or twice a knifing.\"\\n\\n \"She says I\u0027m like you,\" Jonas said.\\n\\n \"Well, hell, that\u0027s a dumb comparison. I don\u0027t even have a master\u0027s degree, let alone a Ph.D.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s quite what she meant.\"\\n\\n Emerson nodded gloomily. \"I was afraid of that. She thinks you\u0027ve got the same wanderlust I\u0027ve got, doesn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n \"Among other things,\" Jonas agreed dryly. \"She also thinks I\u0027m irresponsible, unreliable, and incapable of long-term commitment. She thinks the only reason I\u0027m here is because I want to explore the effect she has on my psychic abilities.\"\\n\\n \"So why does she let you hang around her cabin until three in the morning?\" Emerson demanded shrewdly, obviously striving to make a point in spite of the vodka.\\n\\n Jonas tipped his glass and poured the last of his drink down his throat. \"Damned if I can figure it out. I guess she thinks I\u0027m hell on wheels in bed. We have to face the possibility that your sweet, innocent, puritanical, prissy little daughter is using me for cheap thrills, Emerson.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have to face that possibility,\" Emerson corrected. \"You do. Good luck. In the meantime, I guess I\u0027d better get cracking on getting that money wired to Mr. Reginald C. Yanngton before he does anything else rash.\"\\n\\n Jonas shook off his gloom and tried to focus on more practical matters. \"Just how late are you on that tab, Emerson?\"\\n\\n \"Not more than a few weeks. Hell, Yanngton knows I\u0027m good for it eventually. Wasn\u0027t any need to send some knee-crusher after me.\"\\n\\n \"Wonder how he found you.\"\\n\\n \"The crusher?\" Emerson considered that. \"Good question. I must have left more of a trail than I thought.\\n\\n Not inconceivable that someone who knows me and who also knows Yarington told him about my daughter, and he may have tracked her down to see if I was hiding out with her.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-72.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \\n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
