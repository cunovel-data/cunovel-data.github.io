{"id":80406,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\"Where were you?\"\n \"I was on the street outside, watching you.\" No point in explaining that he had followed her from the cantina down the street where she had stopped previously. She would only ask other questions that would be even harder to answer.\n \"Jonas, this doesn\u0027t make any sense. Are you trying to tell me that because of a brief glimpse and a broken earring, you tracked me down here in Sequence Springs? You expect me to believe that?\"\n The washcloth grew cold in Jonas\u0027s hand. He looked down at it. He had intended to use the cloth to bathe away the pungent, sticky residue of their lovemaking. He had thought Verity might appreciate the warm bath. He had also wanted to soothe the tender female flesh he had taken with a lot of heat but not much finesse. Something told him Verity would not welcome such intimacy now. He put the cold, damp cloth on the table beside the bed.\n \"I followed you, Verity, because I had to,\" he said simply. \"I wanted to see you again. After all, I\u0027d saved you from Pedro. Is it so strange I would want to find out more about you? You ran from that alley as if all the demons in hell were at your heels.\"\n \"I thought you were just another would-be ra**st.\"\n He watched her profile. \"Well, now you know I\u0027m not, don\u0027t you?\"\n She pulled the sheet around herself, withdrawing from him. \"I\u0027m not so sure. Maybe you\u0027re just more subtle than Pedro.\"\n Anger flared in him. He caught her shoulders and forced her to face him. \"That\u0027s a hell of a thing to say. You know damned good and well that what just happened between us wasn\u0027t rape. Don\u0027t you dare accuse me of that. When I left the bed a few minutes ago, you were practically begging me to rush back and make love to you again.\"\n She flinched, her eyes faltering beneath his momentary fury. \"You\u0027re right,\" she said grudgingly. \"It wasn\u0027t rape. But it wasn\u0027t love, either. So why are you here, Jonas? Why did you follow me and go to work for me and then take me to bed?\"\n She would never believe the real story in its entirety. All he could do was stick by the bare bones of the tale. \"I told you the truth. I wanted to see you again. If you\u0027d stuck around that alley until I\u0027d finished with Pedro, I would have introduced myself then. But you ran. So I followed.\"\n She edged away from him. \"Jonas, don\u0027t hand me that kind of line. Men don\u0027t do things like that.\"\n He shrugged. \"I did.\"\n He watched her chew on that undeniable fact. Then something flickered in her eyes and she astonished him with her next leap of logic. \"Does this have anything to do with my father, by any chance? Are you here because of him? Do you work for that sleazeball who\u0027s after him to repay the gambling debt? So help me God, Jonas, if you followed me and used me to get at him, I swear I\u0027ll slit your throat.\"\n Jonas was startled at her deduction. \"No, I don\u0027t work for anyone but you. I knew nothing about your father\u0027s problems until he told us both about them tonight. That\u0027s the truth, Verity. The only reason I came to Sequence Springs was to get to know you better. Can you blame me? I saved you down in Mexico and you didn\u0027t even stick around long enough to thank me. A man can weave a lot of fantasies about a woman he rescues. Human nature. Male nature. And there was nothing to keep me in Mexico.\n I was free to follow you and learn more about you, so I did just that.\"\n She eyed him warily. \"A true drifter. You just go where your fancy takes you, is that it?\"\n He gritted his back teeth but kept his voice casual. \"That\u0027s it.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I believe you, Jonas. You\u0027re making me very nervous.\"\n Jonas kept a tight rein on his self-control. \"I\u0027m sorry, Verity. I guess my following you out of Mexico doesn\u0027t strike you as a romantic gesture, does it? Four hundred years ago someone would have written a ballad about it.\"\n \"Times change,\" she informed him. \"Maybe women today are a little more savvy than they were back then.\"\n \"Times change,\" he agreed. \"Human nature doesn\u0027t. If you\u0027d been born four hundred years ago you would have been the same arrogant, stubborn, infuriating little shrew you are today.\"\n She paled and Jonas instantly flayed himself mentally for his loss of temper. She had been through a lot tonight and she had every right to her suspicions.\n \"If you feel that way about me, I\u0027m surprised you were so eager to go to bed with me,\" Verity whispered.\n He swore softly and reached out, capturing her before she could slide away. Deliberately he overcame her brief struggles and pinned her close against him, his face in her hair.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, honey. I didn\u0027t mean that. I should have kept my damn mouth shut.\"\n He could smell himself on her, Jonas realized as he pulled her close. The acrid scent combined with the lingering fragrance of her feminine arousal made him pulsatingly conscious of the claim he had staked tonight. He could not yet explain to Verity the mental bond that linked them or why he needed her to preserve his sanity. She wouldn\u0027t believe him, let alone understand what he was trying to say. All he could do was reinforce the physical and emotional bonds he had forged tonight. And there were definitely such bonds between them whether she wanted to admit it or not. She would never have gone to bed with him if she hadn\u0027t wanted him very badly.\n Hell, he told himself encouragingly, the woman had waited twenty-eight years to go to bed with a man.\n Surely she must have felt something very powerful for him.\n \"Jonas, I feel like I\u0027ve been through a wringer. I don\u0027t know what to think.\" Her voice was muffled against his chest.\n He clenched his hands in the wonderful fire of her hair. \"I know, honey. I didn\u0027t handle this very well.\n I should have told you who I was right from the start. But you wouldn\u0027t have believed me then, either.\n In fact, you probably would have been even more suspicious of me if I\u0027d shown up on your doorstep and announced I\u0027d followed you from Mexico. I didn\u0027t know how to play it, so I tried to keep things low-key.\n I wanted us to get to know each other. Was that so wrong?\"\n \"No, I suppose not, but I still don\u0027t know what to believe. It\u0027s all very strange.\"\n \"It will look a lot less strange in the morning,\" he assured her. \"I promise. You\u0027re just shook up now because you\u0027ve been through a brand-new experience tonight and you\u0027re still coming to terms with it.\"\n The new sexual experience was only part of the package, he thought. Wait until she realized that she hadn\u0027t been hallucinating earlier when she\u0027d entered that psychic corridor. But he\u0027d leave that for another time.\n \"Does it take a lot to come to terms with the experience of going to bed with someone?\" she demanded tartly, sounding more like her old self. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-27.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
