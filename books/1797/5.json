You really have worked in all these sleazy dives.\"\n Quarrel ignored the question and asked one of his own. \"Did you find your father?\"\n Verity shook her head. \"No. But that\u0027s no big deal. He\u0027ll show up sooner or later. He always does.\"\n She came away from the wall and started toward the office. \"Excuse me for a few minutes.\"\n Jonas dropped a pan back into the sink. \"Hey, wait a minute. What are you going to do?\"\n \"Make a few phone calls,\" she explained sweetly. She smiled at him.\n Jonas stared at her for a long moment. He seemed momentarily disconcerted by her smile. Then he pulled himself together and asked slowly, \"You\u0027re going to call some of those bars?\"\n \"I always check references. What\u0027s the matter, Mr. Quarrel? Did you think I\u0027d hesitate to call places like Tahiti and Manila and Mexico?\"\n He wiped his hands on a towel, studying her intently. \"Well, yeah. Most people are a little intimidated by that kind of long-distance dialing.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got news for you. You\u0027re not the only one who\u0027s had the advantages of extensive world travel. I spent a year and a half in Tahiti, three months in Manila, a year in Mexico, and another year in Hawaii. My memory is a little vague because it\u0027s been a few years, but I think I\u0027ve even been in a few more of these dives than just El Toro Rojo. The Harbor Lights Tavern has a familiar ring. I hate to admit it, but so does the Get Leid.\"\n Quarrel looked genuinely startled. \"You\u0027re kidding. You know some of those places?\"\n \"My father gave me a very well-rounded education.\" Verity walked into her office, vaguely pleased at having finally been able to turn the tables on Jonas Quarrel.\n \"It\u0027ll cost a fortune to call those taverns,\" Jonas pointed out.\n \"I\u0027ll take it out of your first week\u0027s pay.\" Verity smiled slowly as she sat down at her desk and reached for the phone. This was going to prove interesting.\n An hour later she had her answers and Jonas had the dishes done. They faced each other in the small kitchen.\n \"All right,\" Verity said calmly. \"You\u0027ve got the job. Everyone spoke very highly of you. They said you could be relied upon to open a bar on time, you aren\u0027t into drugs, you don\u0027t have the bad habit of helping yourself to the contents of the cash register, and you don\u0027t drink on the job. High praise, indeed, considering the sources. Oh, and Big Al at the Sea Siren said to give you his best and swears he\u0027ll send along the money he owes you now that he has a current address.\"\n Something in Jonas\u0027s eyes seemed to relax. It was replaced with a curious expression that was part anticipation and part satisfaction. \"Thanks, Verity,\" he said. \"I appreciate it.\"\n \"Since you\u0027ve finished the dishes, you can start chopping onions for the vegetable tart I\u0027m going to make. I\u0027ll do the pastry.\"\n \"I\u0027ll get right on it, boss lady.\" Jonas reached for a long-bladed knife, hefting it with an easy familiarity.\n \"There\u0027s just one more small problem.\"\n Verity paused warily in the act of taking a ball of chilled pastry out of the refrigerator. \"What\u0027s that?\"\n \"I\u0027ll need a place to stay.\" Jonas smiled at her. \"Any ideas? Since I\u0027m going to be working for minimum wage, I won\u0027t be able to afford anyplace fancy. I checked out of the Lake Motel this morning. I was running low on cash.\"\n Verity sighed in resignation. \"You can have the cabin my father uses when he deigns to visit. It\u0027s in back of the restaurant.\"\n \"What about your father?\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry. I haven\u0027t heard from him since I got the message inviting me to meet him down in Puerto Vallerta. He\u0027d already left town by the time I got there and I haven\u0027t heard from him since. I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll be disturbing us anytime soon. If he does, you can flip a coin for the bed. Both of you have probably slept on more than one floor in your life.\"\n \"You\u0027re a generous woman, Verity Ames.\"\n \"It\u0027s not that. I think the real problem is that I\u0027m just a little soft in the head when it comes to professional drifters who spend their lives running from their talent.\"\n Jonas\u0027s head came up and his eyes narrowed. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\n Verity looked at him as she rolled out the pastry. \"I called Vincent College after I checked with a few of your previous employers. You really did teach Renaissance history there. What\u0027s more, you were damn good at it. Lots of impressive publications and one book on ancient armory to your credit. And then you gave up teaching for no apparent reason. Have you been drifting around the world ever since?\"\n \"What does all this have to do with your father?\" Jonas asked coolly.\n \"He\u0027s a professional drifter, too. Does the name Emerson Ames mean anything to you?\" Verity realized she was wielding the rolling pin with too much force. Deliberately she made herself relax.\n Jonas flicked off the end of an onion with a negligent slash of the knife. \"Yeah, it does, as a matter of fact.\n Are we talking about the same Emerson Ames who wrote Juxtaposition a few years back?\"\n \"One and the same.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027ll be damned. I seem to remember that book caused a certain, small sensation when it was published. Anybody who had any academic pretensions at Vincent College had it on his coffee table.\n What ever happened to him? Has he written anything since Juxtaposition? \"\n \"Unfortunately,\" Verity said tightly, \"Dad decided Juxtaposition wasn\u0027t his kind of book. He vowed not to waste his time doing another one like it and went back to writing what he claims he likes writing best.\"\n Jonas glanced at her. \"What\u0027s that?\"\n Verity wrinkled her nose. \"Paperback westerns. Can you believe it? The man who was once heralded by The New York Times as the author of the year. A writer who had \u0027boldly and decisively examined and illuminated contemporary uncertainties and paradoxes,\u0027 they said. And this bold genius ups and decides he would rather write westerns.\"\n Jonas stared at her for a moment longer and then began to laugh. It was a deep, masculine roar that filled the kitchen. His golden eyes gleamed with it. \"I think,\" Jonas finally said through his laughter,\n \"that I would like your father.\" He lopped off the end of another onion. \"I hope I get a chance to meet him while I\u0027m here.\"\n \"Something tells me the two of you have a lot in common,\" Verity grumbled.\n Jonas laughed again and flipped the knife into the air. Verity sucked in her breath as the blade spun end over end. Visions of blood and sliced fingers made her clutch at the counter top. But an instant later Jonas neatly caught the knife by its handle and went back to slicing onions. Verity repressed a shudder. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-5.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
