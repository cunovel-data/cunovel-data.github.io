Emerson looked curiously from one to the other. \"Trouble?\"\n \"Jonas considers his ability a mixed blessing,\" Verity explained quietly. \"But at least up until now it\u0027s been limited to a certain era of the past. If he\u0027s getting stronger in terms of range, he\u0027s going to run into more and more objects that will trigger his trips into the corridor.\"\n \"I get it,\" Emerson drawled. \"Could get to be a real nuisance, couldn\u0027t it?\"\n \"To put it mildly,\" Jonas agreed. \"Damn.\" He crumpled the beer can in his hand. \"I could have done without this added complication.\"\n Verity felt a cold chill. She was the cause of this \"added complication\" in his life. Her fingers clenched tightly around the bowl in her hand. Jonas had been drawn to her originally because of her connection with his psychic ability. Maybe that was the very thing that would drive him away from her.\n \"The psychometry still seems to be limited to objects associated strongly with violence, though,\" Jonas said thoughtfully. \"I\u0027m not picking up on just any old emotion, thank God.\"\n \"What do you think that scene in the corridor was all about?\" Emerson asked curiously.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Jonas said. \"That\u0027s the problem with these corridor scenes. I never get more than a few seconds of information. It\u0027s like looking at a few frames on a reel of film. Probably the frames that show the single most violent moment associated with the object I\u0027m holding. It\u0027s the one image that\u0027s most clearly captured, for some reason. Sometimes I feel like I\u0027m part of the image. I know what\u0027s going on around me for those few seconds. But other times, it\u0027s like looking at a photograph of people I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s the way it was yesterday.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you have any theories about why that dagger elicited that particular image of a man bleeding into a plate of linguini?\" Emerson persisted.\n Jonas shrugged. \"If I had to hazard a guess, I\u0027d say we were probably looking at the former owner of the dagger at the moment when he lost possession of it to someone else. Or we could have been looking at someone who had just been stabbed with it.\"\n Verity was startled. \"That\u0027s funny. For some reason, I assumed the man had been shot.\"\n Jonas gave her a thoughtful glance. \"Did you? It\u0027s possible.\"\n Emerson shook his head. \"This is incredible. I didn\u0027t know what to think the night you tried that first test with the pistols and 1 still don\u0027t. I tell myself I have an open mind, but Christ, this is stretching the limits of it, I\u0027ll tell you. You do realize how bizarre this whole thing is, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"It\u0027s been pointed out to me,\" Jonas said dryly.\n Emerson shook his head. \"It\u0027s one thing to think you might have a touch of psychic talent. Hell, lots of people are convinced they\u0027ve had a psychic experience of one kind or another. Telepathy, a bit of precognition, whatever. It\u0027s damn common, in fact. But this business of both of you seeing the same images in some mental corridor is downright spooky. I\u0027d swear you were both lying except that I know my daughter too well. Verity doesn\u0027t lie. And I don\u0027t think you\u0027d bother with this kind of elaborate fiction, Jonas. Too much work involved.\"\n \"That\u0027s the truth.\" Jonas spoke with great feeling. He tossed his crunched beer can into a trash basket in the corner. \"But if you think this whole thing is weird, imagine what it\u0027s like for me. I\u0027ve been assuming for years that I\u0027m the only one on the face of the planet who sees these damned visions when I\u0027m handling old junk.\" He looked at Verity, his eyes molten gold. \"It\u0027s one hell of a relief to find someone who can share the experience with me. At least I can be relatively certain that if I\u0027m slowly going insane, I\u0027m not going there alone.\"\n Emerson looked at both of them. \"Neither of you is crazy and neither of you is a liar. We\u0027re stuck with the only other conclusionâ€”there really is some kind of mental weirdness going on between the two of you.\n Tell me more about the guy who was bleeding into the linguini.\"\n \"There\u0027s not much to tell,\" Verity said. \"I had just turned around and spotted the image when Jonas came up behind me and said we were getting out of there.\"\n \"But he was definitely connected with the dagger?\"\n \"Probably,\" Jonas said slowly. \"I\u0027ve always had the impression that the people who show up in the corridor images are directly connected with the object I\u0027m holding at the time. But I don\u0027t always understand the connection.\"\n Verity wiped her hands on her apron. \"The clothes the man was wearing looked a little out-of-date. Maybe ten or fifteen years old.\"\n \"You were very observant,\" Jonas remarked, eyeing her curiously. \"You didn\u0027t mention the age of his clothes when we talked this over last night. Did you notice anything else?\"\n \"No, except maybe a feeling that the guy knew who it was who had just killed him. The poor man looked so astonished, as if he wasn\u0027t expecting anything like that to happen. Almost as if the other person was a friend.\"\n \"I think you\u0027re right,\" Jonas said reflectively. \"Although I guess it\u0027s equally possible a stranger walked into the room and shot him. A man caught unawares like that could have the same expression of astonishment on his face.\"\n \"What about Kincaid?\" Emerson asked shrewdly. \"Do you think he knows anything about the history of the dagger on his wall?\"\n Jonas lifted one shoulder in a negligent gesture. \"Who knows? He thought the dagger was a genuine sixteenth-century piece, I do know that. He was furious when I told him it was a reproduction. He probably paid a fortune for it. But most collectors like him don\u0027t ask too many questions about the recent past of an object they want to buy. The less they know, the better, as far as they\u0027re concerned.\n If someone shot and killed a man to get hold of that dagger and sell it at huge profit to a fanatic collector like himself, Kincaid wouldn\u0027t want to know about it. Just as Haggerty didn\u0027t push too hard to know the recent history of those pistols. It was enough for him that they were genuine.\"\n \"I can understand that line of thinking, although I\u0027ve always thought it was better to be informed than take a chance on being hung out to dry. Ignorance is not bliss. But I guess we can assume that Kincaid doesn\u0027t know too much about the dagger,\" Emerson concluded.\n \"He didn\u0027t even know it was fake,\" Verity scoffed. She shoved a pan of pasta into Jonas\u0027s hand. \"Here, put this on the counter behind you.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-67.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
