He didn\u0027t bother to turn on the light. \"A very dangerous night.\"\\n\\n Verity didn\u0027t need the overhead light to detect the strange excitement in Damon Kincaid. There was something very wrong about him. Her fingers trembled and she found herself clasping the folds of her velvet gown with enough force to whiten her knuckles. But her smile never wavered. She had a special restaurateur\u0027s smile reserved for occasions when a difficult patron made a fuss. It was the one she used now.\\n\\n \"Were you getting some fresh air outside?\" she asked pleasantly. \"I don\u0027t blame you. It\u0027s awfully crowded in the salon.\" How much longer would Jonas be upstairs? she wondered. The next question was whether he would use this staircase or the front stairs when he returned to the party.\\n\\n \"I agree. The crowd is a bit much,\" Kincaid said easily. \"Perhaps I\u0027ll join you upstairs.\" He put one foot on the bottom tread.\\n\\n Verity sucked in her breath as she instinctively retreated to the step behind her. She wished she had turned on the light at the foot of the staircase. Light would be comforting right now.\\n\\n She no longer tried to ignore her queasy stomach. In the shadows Kincaid was suddenly terrifying. He wore his Renaissance clothes with the nonchalance of a Borgia, looking as much at home in them as Jonas looked in his. The entire evening was taking on an air of unreality, aided and abetted by the elaborate masquerade arranged by Caitlin Evanger.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m heading for a powder room,\" Verity managed to say brightly. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ll see you in a few minutes back in the salon.\" It took an incredible amount of courage to turn her back on him and start up the stairs with the air of a woman who was merely looking for a place to freshen her lipstick.\\n\\n The tactic was a mistake. Kincaid leaped soundlessly up the stairs behind her and whipped an arm around her throat. Verity felt the cold steel nose of a small gun on her neck and the sickening strength in his arm.\\n\\n \"Not a sound, my lady, or I\u0027ll squeeze the breath out of your windpipe.\" Kincaid\u0027s voice implied he would like nothing better than to carry out the threat.\\n\\n Verity didn\u0027t doubt him for an instant. Her father had a saying for such moments, she recalled. It flashed through her head: Things have gone from sugar to shit. Where was Jonas?\\n\\n \"What do you think you\u0027re doing?\" Verity demanded in a husky whisper.\\n\\n \"Rearranging tonight\u0027s agenda. Let\u0027s go.\" He urged her up the stairs. \"We\u0027ll give Tresslar a few minutes to finish the job he\u0027s working on now, and then I\u0027ll signal him and have him remove you to a less crowded location. I want to take my time having a little chat with you, Verity Ames. You\u0027re going to give me some answers to some questions I didn\u0027t have an opportunity to ask Quarrel.\"\\n\\n Verity tried to turn her head and found the gun pressing into her throat. \"What are you talking about?\\n\\n Who\u0027s Tresslar? And where is Jonas?\"\\n\\n \"Tresslar is an employee of mine. And as for your friend Quarrel, I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s no longer a factor in this interesting charade we\u0027re all playing. But I think it\u0027s safe enough to dispense with him because I have you. And you, Verity, will tell me all I need to know. But we\u0027ll conduct that conversation much later. I don\u0027t have time for it now. I\u0027ve got to get back downstairs before too many people notice we\u0027re both missing.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re crazy! What have you done to Jonas?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t waste any time worrying about your ex-lover. He\u0027s out of the picture for good.\"\\n\\n \"Damn you, what did you do to him?\" Verity\u0027s voice rose in spite of the gun and she started to struggle fiercely.\\n\\n Kincaid responded by tightening his arm until Verity could no longer breathe. Panic raced through her as she grew dizzy. She twisted violently in his grasp, trying to hit him with her fists. The heavy velvet skirts she was wearing made it almost impossible to kick out at Kincaid\u0027s legs.\\n\\n \"Stop it, you little bitch!\" Kincaid lost patience and slammed the barrel of the gun against the side of her head.\\n\\n The blow wasn\u0027t hard enough to knock Verity unconscious but it dazed her. She collapsed weakly, nearly taking Kincaid down the stairs with her. He staggered beneath her unbalanced weight but recovered within a couple of steps.\\n\\n \"Be careful, Miss Ames, or I may decide it\u0027s more trouble than it\u0027s worth to keep you alive for a while.\"\\n\\n Verity couldn\u0027t speak. The impact of the gun against her head had had a disorienting effect. The staircase wavered sickeningly as she tried to clear her fuzzy brain. By the time the world settled down again, Kincaid had yanked her to the top of the stairs. She took deep breaths, trying to gather enough strength to scream as he jerked her down the hall.\\n\\n The back stairs had been built against the side of the house and did not bisect the corridor as the main staircase did. Kincaid and Verity emerged next to Jonas\u0027s room.\\n\\n Kincaid didn\u0027t hesitate. \"I think we\u0027ll stash you in your own room for now. Tresslar went through the house earlier and figured out which ones you and Quarrel were using. You\u0027ll be safe here until Tresslar can get up here to retrieve you.\" He came to a halt in front of the door, twisted the knob, and thrust Verity into the darkened room.\\n\\n Verity reeled from the force of Kincaid\u0027s push. She stumbled, tried to regain her balance, and struck the bed. Desperately she reached out to grab a post. Once again she opened her mouth to scream. This time Kincaid backhanded her with such force that she sprawled across the bed. Her velvet skirts were flung high above her knees. When she rolled frantically to one side, they went higher, riding up above her thighs.\\n\\n Kincaid dropped the gun on the nightstand and used both hands to subdue Verity. She still hadn\u0027t completely recovered from the blow against the side of her head and her resulting weakness made her an easy victim.\\n\\n Furious with herself and enraged with Kincaid, Verity lashed out again and again as Kincaid anchored her heaving body with his own and slapped a pillow over her face.\\n\\n Verity gasped as the stifling softness came down over her nose and mouth and then it became impossible to get a complete breath. She was going to die here in this terrible bed. Kincaid was going to suffocate her. Jonas might already be dead.\\n\\n She could feel Kincaid\u0027s heavy body all along the length of her own. Dimly she realized he had an erection. The knowledge that he was getting sexually turned on by her death struggles inflamed her further. In desperation she dug her nails into his arms, determined to leave whatever scars she could.\\n\\n \"Dammit,\" he hissed as she scraped futiiely at him. \"Stop fighting me or I\u0027ll have to kill you now,\"\\n\\n The bedroom door slammed open and the light came on as someone struck the wall switch. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-87.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \\n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
