{"id":80418,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"\"Why should you?\" Jonas asked blandly. \"It would be busy haunting the cliffs where Sandquist died.\"\n Verity shot him a repressive glare.\n The studio at the top of the stairs occupied an entire corner of the house. The bulging, faceted windows allowed light from two sides into the stark, bare room. It was the first room Verity had seen that was not painted gray. Caitlin \u0027s studio was white from floor to ceiling.\n There were several canvases stacked facing the walls, most quite large. An easel, a huge table decorated with several years\u0027 worth of spattered paint, and some artist\u0027s tools sat in the middle of the white floor. One large canvas, much bigger than the others and draped in a sheet, was tilted inward against one wall.\n \"Is that the painting you\u0027re currently working on?\" Verity inquired, indicating the large canvas.\n \" Bloodlust is done,\" Caitlin said, her voice perfectly neutral. \"I finished it a few months ago. I\u0027m preparing to sell it at an auction. Until then, I\u0027m not letting anyone look at it.\"\n \"An auction?\" Verity eyed the draped canvas, wondering what was underneath. \"Will it be conducted by a San Francisco auction house?\"\n \"No,\" Caitlin stated firmly. \"I will conduct the auction myself, here, in this house. Only a certain, select group will be invited to bid on Bloodlust. \"\n \"Are you planning on holding the auction soon?\" Verity\u0027s curiosity was definitely aroused, although she wasn\u0027t certain why.\n \"Yes,\" Caitlin said. \"Soon.\" Her eyes went to Jonas, who was glancing around the white room with idle interest. \"Shall we go downstairs? Tavi will be ready with lunch.\"\n Much later that night Tavi went through the ritual of preparing her employer for bed. She removed Caitlin\u0027s robe and the brace on her leg and poured a snifter of brandy.\n \"He might not touch it,\" Tavi warned. \"He didn\u0027t touch the rapier in her room earlier today. He didn\u0027t take hold of the one in his own room when I showed him into it. Maybe he won\u0027t try to touch it at all.\"\n \"He won\u0027t be able to resist handling it, however briefly,\" Caitlin said with grave certainty. \"It\u0027s perfect for him. It\u0027s from the right era, the right historical context, and it\u0027s genuine. What\u0027s more, although you and I can\u0027t feel it, it must be carrying a whole freight load of heavy, screaming emotions. All the vibrations associated with rape and death. How can he not take it in his hands, at least for a moment or two? That rapier will draw him like a magnet. And when he does take it down from the wall to examine it, we\u0027ll know for certain that he still has the touch. He\u0027s bound to show some reaction.\" She looked at the small television screen on a table near the bed. \"The camera is working well.\"\n The television screen held a black and white image of a long, tapered rapier mounted on the wall of a bedroom.\n Tavi nodded reluctantly. \"I set it up this morning and double-checked it while Quarrel and Ames walked along the cliffs this afternoon. If Quarrel takes hold of the rapier and it has any obvious effect on him, we\u0027ll be able to observe it. Unless, of course, he picks up the rapier after he\u0027s turned out the lights, in which case the camera will be blind.\"\n \"He\u0027s not likely to look at such a valuable item in the dark,\" Caitlin scoffed. \"He\u0027ll have the lights on when he checks it out.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure you\u0027ll be able to tell if he responds to the rapier?\" Tavi asked doubtfully. \"I don\u0027t see...\"\n \"I\u0027ll know,\" Caitlin said. \"I\u0027m sure of it. I saw what happens to him when he picks up anything that carries a strong emotional charge.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure if I believe in this strange talent you say he has.\"\n \"Psychometry?\" Caitlin sipped her brandy, her eyes steady on the unwavering image on the television screen. \"Believe in it, Tavi. It\u0027s for real. It caused him to nearly kill a man five years ago.\"\n Tavi frowned. \"If you say so, Caitlin. If you\u0027re right and the rapier has a strong effect on him, what\u0027s to keep him from going crazy the way he did the last time? He might kill us all in our beds.\"\n Caitlin shook her head. \"No, we\u0027ll be safe enough as long as the present time context is considerably different from the historical context in which the rapier was used. The lab reports are clear on that score.\"\n \"What do you expect him to do tonight?\"\n \"He\u0027ll probably try touching the rapier for a moment or two because his curiosity will get the better of him.\n He\u0027ll drop it quickly when it becomes too much for him. That was the way he dealt with objects during the testing sessions I observed at Vincent.\" Caitlin stared at the television screen. \"I wonder what goes on in his mind when he touches an old object and senses its past vibrations. I wonder what he actually sees.\"\n Tavi shivered and said nothing as she began to massage Caitlin\u0027s weak leg. She wasn\u0027t sure what to believe, but she knew that there was little chance of changing her dear, tormented friend\u0027s mind. Caitlin had to have her vengeance. On the television screen the black and white image remained unchanged.\n Jonas glanced at his watch and tossed aside the book he had been reading. It was a collection of Lorenzo de\u0027 Medici\u0027s poems, which he had borrowed from Emerson Ames\u0027s library. Jonas had brought the book along on the trip with some vague notion of brushing up his own love poetry. He had decided to take lessons from a master.\n Lorenzo had been a true Renaissance man: a connoisseur of art, an astute banker, a politician, scholar, and poet. In addition, he could handle a sword, as he had proven the day he fought his way to safety after an assassination attempt in a church.\n The man had also had a bawdy sense of humor. Jonas savored one of the light carnival songs Lorenzo had penned for a holiday procession. It was a paean to Bacchus, desire, and dance. Wine, women, and song. But underneath the bright lyrics was a subtle warning that life was short and it was foolish to postpone pleasure and happiness. Lorenzo must have had a few premonitions. He had died at the age of forty-three.\n Jonas reflected briefly on the sobering thought of just how close he himself was getting to forty-three.\n He had wasted a lot of years running from something he still didn\u0027t understand, let alone know how to control. Some would say he had taken Lorenzo\u0027s advice and opted for life\u0027s pleasures during the past five years, but he knew better.\n He got up out of the steel and gray-leather armchair and walked to the window. He had taken off his shirt and boots earlier and now wore only his jeans. He had planned to go straight to bed but that had proved impossible. The room was filled with a disturbing influence that made him restless and uneasy. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-40.html","bookId":1797,"book":{"id":1797,"title":"Gift of Gold (Gift #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Destiny found them, and rapture, wild and free, opened their hearts... \n As she fled to safety in the dark of the Mexican night, Verity Ames could not see the man who had saved her from attack... but he was determined to see her again.
