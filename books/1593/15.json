Just as he was drifting off, he felt Konnor’s nose nuzzling his hair at the back of his head. It felt so wonderful he leaned back into it and felt a kiss, so soft he might have imagined it at the nape of his neck.\n He awoke what must have been hours later, still on his side, his arm still stretched above his head. Someone was rubbing their hands all over his body, and somehow he had lost his underwear, so their hands were taking a lot of liberties with his cock and balls.\n “Finally awake, Blondie?” A sultry, sexy voice asked by his ear. Ethan nodded and a big hand slapped his ass, leaving a sting. “I expect you to answer me, boy.”\n “Yes, sir. I’m awake.”\n Konnor rolled him on his back and leaned down to take his nipple in his mouth. He started a slow, steady suction while he put his free hand around Ethan’s prick, rubbing slowly up and down on his flesh. Adding his teeth to the pressureon Ethan’s nipple, he nibbled at him, squeezing and pulling on Ethan’s cock. Ethan gave a low moan of pleasure. His balls were aching, and he started driving his hips up into Konnor’s touch. Konnor put a stop to that by taking his hand away from his cock and pushingEthan’s hips back down on the mattress.\n “Don’t move,” Konnor said, moving his hand back up to Ethan’s cock, rubbing the tip with his thumb and delving down into his slit.\n “Oh, gods,” Ethan moaned. “Please, sir.”\n “Please what?”\n “It-it feels so…”\n Konnor bent his head and pushed his hot tongue into the slit, fucking it. Ethan’s hips rose off the bed and he screamed.\n Konnor laughed, looking back up at him. “Shhh…you’ll have Larssen down here in a minute, thinking I’m killing you.”\n “I-I’m sorry, sir.”\n He gazed down at him for a long moment. “Turn over on your side, baby.”\n Ethan rolled back over and saw Konnor’s hand reach past him to find a tube of lube on the table next to the bed. He spread the gel on his fingers and stroked over his hole with the lubricant a few times before delving a finger inside and gently stretching him. “This is something Helga couldn’t do for you, unless she used a dildo. Is that what she did, boy?” His voice had grown tight and angry and his finger, now joined by another, became rougher.\n “N-no, sir. She never touched me that way.”\n The finger stilled and Ethan felt a hot whisper in his ear. “Don’t lie to me. She said she had you.”\n Ethan shook his head frantically. It was important that Konnor believe him. “She didn’t, sir. I don’t know why she said that, but it was a lie. She told me she preferred females.”\n Konnor pulled his head back and stared down into his eyes before cursing softly. “That bitch. She was just winding me up.” His gaze fell back to pin Ethan again. “Anyone else touch you? Did anyone fuck this little hole?”\n “Never, sir. No one touched me…that way. They just beat me and made me…”\n “Made you what?” Konnor’s tone was sharp and demanding.\n Ethan took a deep breath and a little sob caught in his throat. “They made me get naked and scrub floors and clean their nasty toilets.” He turned his face toward Konnor to let him see his pain and outrage.” And they filmed it!”\n Konnor laughed out loud. At the look of betrayal on Ethan’s face, he looked as if he tried to stop and rubbed a hand across his mouth. “I’m sorry, Blondie, that must have been awful for you, and I didn’t mean to laugh. It’s just…I thought they raped you, baby.”\n “Raped me? Oh no. She did ask me if I was a virgin, though, and I told her no.”\n Konnor stiffened again, and his fingers started moving slowly in and out. “Yes, that’s right, she said you told her that. Who else have you been with, Ethan? One of those boys from your group home? That damned beta you kept talking to at the arena?” His voice had become low and sexy again, but there was a kind of growl to it at the same time that chilled Ethan. He turned his head and stared into Konnor’s eyes.\n “Why, no, it was you, sir. Don’t you remember? In the judging room?”\n Ethan saw another change come overKonnor’s face,and he bent suddenly to take Ethan’s mouth possessively. He plundered his mouth for several minutes before he finally released him. Ethan was breathless and he felt like thrusting his hips again. “That’s what you were talking about? So when we mated was your first time to make love, baby?”\n “Yes, sir.”\n Konnor made another sound and then he was pulling his fingers out and lining up his cock with Ethan’s hole. He thrust inside and kept still for a moment. Ethan figured he must be letting him get used to it, but he wanted it now. He pushed his ass back against him. “Please sir. I need it.”\n “I know what you need, Blondie, and I’ll decide when you get it.”\n “Yes,sir,” Ethan said miserably, his voice sounding a little desperate, even to his own ears. He felt Konnor slide in then, big and thick and filling him up. It burned some, but when his big prick rubbed over the spot deep inside him he’d discovered the last time Konnor did this, Ethan moaned and squirmed with pleasure. Konnor kissed the back ofEthan’s neck and licked at the skin over the still-healingmating bite, while he kept one hand flat on Ethan’s belly, not letting him get away, pushing in deeper. Konnor thrust again and again and at the same time moved his hand up and down Ethan’s cock, pulling and pushing him toward a climax.\n Konnor bent over him. “Come for me, baby.” And Ethan came hard, Konnor joining him, his spunk pulsing into Ethan, hot and wet and damn near perfect.\n He lay still inside Ethan for a long time and then finally pulled out and swung his legs over the bed. He walked into the adjoining bathroom, and Ethan heard the shower start up. He came back to the bed and unsnapped the cuff on Ethan’s wrist, holding out his hand. “Come with me, Ethan.”\n Ethan hurried to get up and follow him to the shower. He got inside with Konnor and let the warm water soak him. Konnor handed him the soap. “Wash me, slave.”\n After all the endearments of the last few minutes, the word surprised and hurt him a little, but he shook himself and remembered his place. This was what he’d asked for, after all. He dutifully soaped up his hands and ran them all over his master’s beautiful, muscular body. Konnor made no move to do anything other than stand still and let him bathe his body, and in a few minutes he stepped from the shower and dried himself, glancing over his shoulder at Ethan. Ethan hurriedly jumped out, dried off and walked behind him back to the bedroom.\n Konnor got dressed and tossed a pair of pants and a soft shirt over to Ethan. “Put these on. I don’t want you naked in front of my family. That’s for me, only, understand?”\n “Yes, sir.” He put the clothes on and stood with his hands behind his back in the presentation position when he was finished.\n Konnor nodded. “Come with me. We’ll have breakfast and then we’ll relieve Larssen. We should be getting back home pretty soon.”\n Ethan nodded, but the idea of arriving on Konnor’s planet was alarming. He’d have to face Konnor’s family, and the butterflies that already churned in his stomach went into overdrive. Somehow he had to do it. He had to face all those alphas, knowing they knew exactly what he was. All the lost, lonely feelings that were never far from the surface came roaring back to taunt him.\n Chapter Six\n The mention of food had Ethan eagerly following his master down the corridors. His stomach must have thought his throat had been cut, because it was jumpy and unsettled. Konnor went into a small galley and opened some cabinets. He found the food packets and thrust two of them into a small food processing machine. In seconds, the smells of his favorite breakfast assailed his nostrils. It was standard Lycan fare, Levolian sausage and yams. His mouth watering, he leaned forward eagerly as Konnor took the packets from the machine. He opened up his own packet, and Ethan’s stomach growled. It looked so delicious, the sausage done to a perfect golden color and light steam coming off the yams. Then Konnor opened Ethan’s packet. It was cereal and milk.\n Konnor’s lips turned up at the look on Ethan’s face . “Less calories, baby. Love slaves have to watch their figures, you know. We don’t want you getting a fat belly.”\n Fat belly? Ethan looked down at his flat stomach in horror, but Konnor just laughed and ruffled his hair. “You can sit on the chair to eat when it’s just the two of us, but of course, when we have company in the future, you’ll have to sit at my feet.”\n Ethan nodded and resentfully took a bite of his cereal. Any old port in a storm, after all, and he was starving. They ate companionably for a few minutes, and then Konnor stood up, tapping his foot impatiently. Ethan gazed up at him in astonishment. How could he have eaten so quickly? He choked down a few more bites as Konnor frowned at him.\n “I thought you told me you were well-trained, and you were going to be the perfect love slave? So far, I’m not seeing it.”\n Ethan felt the flush travel all over his body as he jumped to his feet. “I’m sorry. I’ll try harder.”\n “Hmm…” Konnor said skeptically. “You’d better or you’ll be spending a lot of time over my knee. Now hurry up and dispose of the packets. Then follow me up to the comm deck.”\n Ethan rushed to gather up the packets, wincing in real emotional pain when he dropped one in his hurry, spilling the remains of his cereal all over the floor. He heard a little growl behind him and thrust the packets quickly into the trash incinerator, and grabbed some napkins to wipe up his spill. He turned to step up close to Konnor, his head lowered. Konnor took his arm, whirled him around and gave him a hard swat on his butt. Ethan opened his mouth in shock and moved his hands back to the offended flesh, but Konnor fixed him with a stern look. “Don’t you dare rub it or you’ll get two more twice as hard.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/konnor-and-his-omega-mate-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-3/page-15.html","bookId":1593,"book":{"id":1593,"title":"Konnor and His Omega Mate (Love Slaves of the Alphas #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Konnor and His Omega Mate (Love Slaves of the Alphas #3) \n Ethan is having a really bad day.
