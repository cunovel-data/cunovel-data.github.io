The words that came from Konnor’s mouth didn’t shock him, really. He had a feeling that was what Konnor was thinking all along, but it did hurt. Badly. His stomach started the cramping immediately, and the pain was steadily growing. He had to find a way to stop it soon, but for now he just didn’t have the energy.\n What could he do? He couldn’t leave, even if he wanted to. He was on a ship, for the gods’ sake, in the middle of who knew where. Besides, though he didn’t care so much about himself, it would hurt Konnor physically, because of the damned mating bond, and he didn’t want that. His actions had caused him enough pain already.\n When the idea came to him, it seemed so simple and so obvious he should have thought of it right away. Ethan was omega, so he would simply be the best omega slave anyone ever had. Katya had trained him well. He’d overheard Konnor say that Katya had sex with Ethan, and it simply wasn’t true. She’d never touched him in that way, and he wondered what she’d said to Konnor to make him think she had. It didn’t really much matter. She had still degraded him and made him unworthy to be the mate of an alpha. He touched the heavy platinum collar around his neck that Konnor had never removed. She had also trained him well to be a love slave, and that would have to be his new role with Konnor.\n He wouldn’t tie Konnor down with any demands as a mate . That would be wrong, considering how Konnor felt about Ethan. But if he were to act as his love slave, he could still keep Ethan close by, and thus avoid the physical pain it would cause them both, and yet he wouldn’t be tied down by him. He would be free to be with other lovers and if he found a person he could fall in love with, he could simply keep Ethan on the side for occasional sex and take the other person for his true mate.\n That’s what a lot of Lycan males did with their love slaves . They were usually mated and took the slaves when their wives were too tired or just didn’t want sex so often anymore. A love slave ensured they could then satisfy the strong Lycan male sex drive and keep their mates happy at the same time.\n The only flaw in his plan was Konnor himself. He knew that Konnor would never agree, because he would never want to hurt Ethan. No, his only chance was to make Konnor think it was what Ethan wanted, to make him think Ethan didn’t care for Konnor in the least and would be happier making their arrangement strictly a master-slave arrangement. If Konnor wished, he could even let his brother, cousins and friends use Ethan. It would kill Ethan for that to happen, but if thatwas what would make Konnor happy, then he’d find a way to go along with it. Besides, if Konnor liked to play at the clubs that catered to masters and their submissive slaves, then he could show Ethan off and participate in public displays. Konnor might enjoy that. Yes, he thought it was a good plan, but first he had to get Konnor on board and not have him hesitate out of some misguided feelings of pity. His disappointment in Ethan and his hatred for him would be better than his pity.\n He got up off the bed and slowly started to remove his clothes. Eventually he would need the leather thong that loveslaves wore on Lycanus, but for now, he’d leave on just the underwear he’d borrowed from Konnor. It was brief and tight-fitting. And his collar. The collar was a nice touch and would let Konnor know what he had planned. After taking everything else off and hanging it back in Konnor’s closet, he sat on the bed and waited for Konnor to come in.\n Konnor felt terrible about Ethan overhearing the conversation he had with Larssen, and he didn’t know exactly how to make it better. Of course, he knew he had to apologize, and he planned on doing that now, but how could he get Ethan to believe him again when he told him being an omega was nothing to be ashamed of? He was such a damned hypocrite. And the feelings he had didn’t really stem from the fact Ethan was omega. Well, not much, anyway. Old habits and ways of thinking really did die hard, it seemed. But his feelings really stemmed from the fact that Ethan had rejected him and run from him, right into the hands of people who robbed him of his innocence. The sweet innocence Konnor loved so much about him. Squaring his shoulders, he put his hand on the button that would allow entry to his room. He would go inside and make up with Ethan and apologize for his stupid remarks, and Ethan would forgive him. He had to.\n Opening the door, he was surprised to see Ethan sitting on the side of the bed wearing only a pair of Konnor’s underwear, and that damned collar. “Ethan, baby?” Konnor stepped further inside the room and Ethan turned a cool, distant face toward him.“You were wearing some of my things earlier. What happened? Didn’t they fit well? I can try to find you something else to wear.”\n “Don’t bother . As soon as we get back to your home, you can buy me some of the leather thongs the love slaves wear on Lycanus.I’d prefer that, actually. It clearly denotes exactly what I am.”\n Konnor took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. “Ethan, I know you’re angry over what you thought you heard…”\n “I’m not angry. What you said were your honest feelings, and you can’t hide the way you really feel. I’d be insulted if you tried. No, it’s better to get everything out in the open between us, so there won’t be any misunderstandings in the future.”\n “Ethan—”\n “No, please let me have my say, sir. Please hear me out, and then ofcourse, I’ll abide by whatever you decide.”\n Konnor leaned against the door and narrowed his eyes. What was going on in that head of his? Konnor nodded, and motioned for him to go ahead and speak.\n “Thank you. As I see it, we’ve both been put in a very awkward position by the urge for us to be mated. I felt the attractiontoo, right away, but I didn’t think it was possible for a powerful alpha such as you to be mated to someone like me. I only really became aware of the mating urge after I ran away, but I did feel it too, and missing you made me really miserable.” He glanced up at Konnor to see if he had any comment. When he simply gazed back at him, he continued.\n “So here we are in the middle of this thing, and I know you’re feeling trapped—”\n “Ethan—”\n Ethan held up a hand. “Please sir, you promised to let me have my say.”\n Konnor blew out a harsh breath, but he nodded again. “Well, then, spit it out, Blondie.”\n “I’m trying, sir. I only see one way out of this for both of us, and I hope you’ll agree to it.”\n “You see only one way out, huh? And what might that be? And why would it entail you being almost naked on my bed?”\n “I’m trying to get to it, sir. I’m an omega and destined by fate to be a love slave. There’s no way around it, and I’ve tried to run from it and we both saw how that turned out.”\n “Mmm, so we did.”\n “So I have a proposal for you. Treat me as your love slave, as your submissive. I’ve been well-trained. Mistress Katya even gave me pain training with whips and canes.” He glanced up at the small sound like a growl that came from Konnor, but nervously, he kept going. “I’m a very good slave, sir, and I’d make you a fantastic submissive. I can let you off the hook as far as treating me like a mate. I know you don’t want to be tied down to someone like me. You’re an alpha,and I’m the lowest rank possible, an omega. I understand that. AndI don’t want you for a mate either.”\n Konnor, who’d been about to interrupt this load of crap, suddenly straightened up at that last comment. “You don’t want me as your mate?”\n “No, sir. What in the world would I do with an alpha as my mate? You’re very handsome, but I can’t deal with all the drama, frankly, and I wouldn’t feel equal to the task of being around your alpha brother and all your alpha cousins. I’d constantly feel the strain and it would make both of us unhappy. No, I don’t love you, and I never could.”\n Konnor felt his cheeks growing warm. “You don’t love me. And you’d be unhappy as my mate?”\n “Oh, yes, sir, I would. And you needn’t sound so hurt about my feelings for you. I know very well that you don’t love me. I mean, how could you? You barely know me, really, and then there’s the rank thing. There may be some less dominant, less powerfulalphas who wouldn’t make me feel like a second class citizen, but I’m sorry, sir, you’re just not one of them. I’d always know you felt embarrassed by me as your mate, and that wouldn’t be good for either of us.”\n “I see…”\n “So I can be your love slave. I’d be happier that way, and then if you meet someone and fall in love with them, you’d be free to make them your mate. No one would ever have to know I’m your real mate. I’d certainly never tell anyone. You can keep me around so you don’t get physicallyill, and I wouldn’t interfere in any way.”\n Konnor looked down at his feet. He was so angry, he had to be careful not to explode and choke the shit out of his mate. “And what about you, Ethan? What if you fall in love with someone else?” He was very proud of how even and calm he’d kept his voice. Only the crumbling woodwork under his fingers would give him away, so he shifted his body to stand in front of it.\n Ethan shook his head. “I don’t ever expect to fall in love, sir. I imagine you’ll keep me busy with plenty of sex, though…” He angled a glance over at Konnor. “If you’d like me to service your brother and your cousins, I could do that.”\n The wood on the frame came apart in his hands. “Service them?” he asked in a voice only a bit higher than his normal tone.\n “Yes, sir. I’ll do whatever you tell me to do.” He stood up and came over to where Konnor stood at the door, dropping fluidly and gracefully to his knees in front of him. “I’d like to service you now, sir, if that’s all right.”\n Konnor nodded, unable to speak past the sudden lump in his throat. His damn balls were drawn up so tight that it could be them half choking him. Ethan’s graceful, long fingers soon unbuttoned his trousers and slid them down his hips. His warm lips engulfed Konnor, and on the upward stroke of his tongue, he ran it over the long vein throbbing up the length ofKonnor’s shaft. Konnor made an involuntary cry of pleasure, his knees so weak he had to lean heavily against the woodwork. Ethan bent to his task, taking Konnor’s shaft deep in his mouth. Ethan’s lips were stoking a fire in Konnor’s blood. He cupped Konnor’s balls in his hand, kneading them and massaging as Konnor arched into him. He slid his tongue down farther, taking each of his balls in his mouth and even lapping his tongue across his hole. Konnor pinched his eyes shut and held on as Ethan moved back up to suck the head of his cock, swirling his tongue over it again and again. He nibbled gently at the head, and Konnor’s cock became even more huge, and harder than he thought possible. When Ethan licked a longstripe up Konnor’s cock, looking up at him wickedly through his eyelashes, Konnor had enough. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/konnor-and-his-omega-mate-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-3/page-13.html","bookId":1593,"book":{"id":1593,"title":"Konnor and His Omega Mate (Love Slaves of the Alphas #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Konnor and His Omega Mate (Love Slaves of the Alphas #3) \n Ethan is having a really bad day.
