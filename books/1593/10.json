Lycans actually had surprisingly little body hair in their humanoid forms and Ethan, like other Lycans, found it unattractive anyway, so he didn’t mind this part of his daily ritual. He rinsed himself carefully then and finally turned off the hot spray. Drying himself off, he stepped to the mirror and inspected his hair. It was longer than he liked, but Katya wouldn’t let him cut it. Instead he applied some of the hair products she kept on hand and scrunched up his curls with his fingers like she’d taught him. By this time, he could hear her loud, strident voice in the other room, squared his shoulders and went out to face her. “About time you got here, boy. Come over here and bend over. Let me look at you.” The omega came over to her quickly, perhaps knowing the consequences of a slow response. When she got nervous like she was now, she sometimes lost her temper, and had been known to use the pain stick on her charges repeatedly. Since the last time she’d lost her temper with this boy, though, and he’d passed out, she had been more careful. He was too valuable to damage in any permanent way and too frequent use of the pain sticks had been known to cause nerve damage. She inspected him carefully as he bent over in front of her and satisfied, she grunted at him to kneel in front of her and raise his face. She’d brought in some of her makeup to use on him. He had naturally pink lips and cheeks, but a little enhancement never hurt. First perhaps, a little kohl for his eyes. She had thought about permanent tattoos but some buyers didn’t care for it, though with this boy, it would have been striking. Those red, glowing eyes would have looked beautiful with permanent eyeliner. Sighing, she settled for a thick layer of kohl around his eyes and then applied a pink lip-gloss to his lips. She signaled for a servant to bring her a platinum slave collar to put around his neck in place of the plain one he was now wearing. The platinum looked good against his skin, and besides, she always added the cost to her bottom line, with just a little extra for profit. It was little enhancements like these that earned her repeat business. The blond in front of her should bring in enough to keep her bottom line nice and healthy for a long time to come. A Lycan omega was a rare commodity and almost never became available to the general public. She’d actually been surprised when it was a Lycan who’d contacted her about his purchase, a very rich, very powerful Lycan at that. He would have had access to bid on omegas on his home planet, but as he told her on their holo-cam conversation, omegas were exceedingly rare, and he’d been after one for a long time. He would be coming in person soon to inspect this one, and she felt confident he would make the purchase. After all, the omega’s blond hair was pretty and most unusual, and she had trained the beautiful boy herself. The omega was quite malleable, really, and in only two weeks’ time, she had done won ders with him. Of course, he was an omega, so he was born to serve. One of her servants came to whisper in her ear that her visitor had arrived and was most impatient to get negotiations started. Anxious, was he? She automatically jacked the price up a few thousand diamond standards. She didn’t dare go higher than that, as the boy was already at the top price for a slave as it was. She didn’t want to queer the deal. She glared down at the boy, who was kneeling at her feet. “Stand up and bend over the table.” The boy got to his feet on shaky legs and she pulled the anal plug from her pocket. It wasn’t a large one, but her clients liked the boys to be ready for them. She applied a little lube from a tube in her pocket—wouldn’t do to forego its use and injure him just before his buyer had a chance to look him over—and inserted the plug inside the boy. His entire body turned red, and she gave him a slap on his butt and laughed. “Still able to blush after all you’ve been through? You really were a find. I’ll have to send Helga a thank you gift along with her percentage.” Katya heaved herself to her feet and went to meet the Lycan. If things went as planned, by the time this night was over, she’d be a great deal richer. She entered the waiting area where the Lycan was, and was surprised to see two huge men in the parlor. Her eyes darted back and forth between them until one of them stepped forward. “Mistress Katya? My name is Konnor Balenescu, and I’ve come for the omega.” “Have you now?” she said, permitting a small smile to turn up the corners of her mouth. “He’s certainly for sale, if we can come to an agreement.” Something savage peeked out of the Lycan’s eyes for a moment and Katya took an involuntary step backward. So, his beast was close to the surface. This one could be dangerous. She clutched her pain stick closer and her thumb slipped down to the switch on the side of the cane to ratchet up the intensity, just in case. Right away, the other Lycan came forward and put his big body between them. “Thank you, Mistress. I’m sure an agreement can be reached. Money is no object if the omega meets my brother’s needs.” Katya peered around the man in front of her to regard the one who called himself Konnor. She cleared her throat nervously. “Of course I meant no disrespect.” She lowered her gaze. It had been a long time since she’d been in a room with two alphas. “I’ve had several bids on him so far, but no one besides you has been willing to meet my price.” She spoke directly to Konnor Balenescu. “Did you watch the video ad on the young omega while you were waiting? We’ve only just completed it, but I think it turned out quite nicely.” Konnor’s lips tightened. “Yes. We watched it.” “Delicious, isn’t he? I particularly enjoyed watching him scrub the floors, that pert little ass up in the air. Very tempting, yes? ” Konnor pushed his brother impatiently out of his way. “Is he…untouched? Has anyone else had him? ” “Well, not quite,” she said. No one, including Katya, had ever had sex with him at her establishment. Katya herself had no interest in men, so other than putting him through his paces with whippings and the like, she’d not so much as touched him sexually. However, most of her clients liked a boy with experience, so she lied. “He’s not exactly a virgin, buthe’s barely broken in,” she said with a laugh that she’d been told sounded surprisingly young. “He confessed he had one small adventurebefore he came into my hands,” she said. “So, sincehe wasn’t a virgin and most of my clients appreciate a boy who knows his way around a bedroom, I took the opportunity to teach him a few morethings…”A low growl began in the Lycan’s throat and she glanced over at the other nervously. “Of course, if he won’t suit you, I can find you a virgin.” “No.” The word was accompanied by an emphatic shake of the head. “He’s the one I want. When can I see him? ” “Right away, of course. My, you areeager, aren’t you? I’ve arranged for you to have some time alone with him, just in case you’d like a small sample of his charms. Or perhaps both of you…” “No!” The single word spoken with great intensity came from both of them almost in unison. She glanced up in surprise, and Konnor shook his head. “No thank you. My brother will stand watch outside the door, however. I…wouldn’t like to be disturbed.” “Certainly. No one would dream of disturbing you, no matter what…um…noises should come from the room. Your privacy is most important here. Feel free to take as much time as you like with him.” The big Lycan nodded grimly, and Katya led them down a short corridor to the room. “You can wait in here and I’ll fetch him.” She turned her back and went down the hall to get the boy. Katya had been off Lycanus 2 for many cycles, and she’d almost forgotten how intense Lycan alphas could be.She’d be glad to make this deal and get the boy off her hands. These two made her nervous. Ethan’s knees were shaking as he walked down the hallway at the end of his leash to enter the room where the potential buyer was waiting. Mistress Katya led him, jerking impatiently at the chain when he let his nerves get the better of him and stumbled. She pulled him to the door where someone was sitting quietly in a chair by the door. He kept his eyes firmly on the floor in front of him ashe’d been ordered, but he could hear a slight gasp come from whoever sat watching his approach. “Yes, he’s quite beautiful, isn’t he ? One of the nicest specimens we’ve had to come through in a long time.” The other person merely grunted his assent and Mistress Katya used her knuckles to rap on the door. It swung open and she led Ethan inside. “Here he is, sir. I’ll leave you alone with him to get acquainted. Take your time and just come find me when you’re ready.” She turned to Ethan. “Present yourself, boy.” She unsnapped his collar and stood back. Ethan took his position in the middle of the room, afraid to look up and see who his potential buyer might be. He was standing like Katya had taught him, legs apart, shoulders back, chin up, but eyes focused on the floor. A chill breeze swept into the room and over his naked skin, causing goose bumps to rise on his flesh. The damned anal plug Mistress Katya put in him was giving him an uncomfortable feeling of fullness and every few steps down the hallway it had jostled against some secret place inside him that gave him a pleasurable jolt. How could he possibly get pleasure from such a thing? He really must be as depraved and defective as Mistress Katya told him he was. “Oh, I forgot to tell you,” Mistress Kat ya said on her way out the door. “His name is Ethan, though he’ll answer to whatever you want to call him.” The door closed softly behind her. Another long moment passed and then a deep, rumbling voice spoke up from across the room. “I think I’ll call you…Blondie.” Ethan’s head shot up at the name, and he almost fainted from shock. It was his alpha, Konnor Balenescu standing not five feet away from him, his handsome face frowning as he gazed at Ethan. “K-Konnor…” he said softly, taking a half step toward him. Konnor’s next words, though, stopped him in his tracks.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/konnor-and-his-omega-mate-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-3/page-10.html","bookId":1593,"book":{"id":1593,"title":"Konnor and His Omega Mate (Love Slaves of the Alphas #3)","description":"Storyline: Konnor and His Omega Mate (Love Slaves of the Alphas #3) Ethan is having a really bad day.
