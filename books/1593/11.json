This wasn’t the kind alpha he remembered. This man was fierce and angry looking, his beautiful red eyes glowing dangerously. He crossed the room in two steps and took hold of Ethan’s chin roughly, tilting his head up toward the light. “What’s this shit on your face?” he snarled, and rubbed at his bottom lip contemptuously with his thumb. “What have you let them do to you?”\\n\\n He dropped his hand and turned away, as if he could no longer bear to touch Ethan or look at him. Ethan was almost in shock. To have endured so much over the past two weeks and now to be so close to his alpha again. He had dreamed of this moment so many times,and he’d tortured himself over and over at his stupidity in running from him. Konnor was right here in front of him, but he had given Ethan a look of such repulsion and disappointment that it was like a physical pain in Ethan’s heart. Fear gripped him. What if he so disgusted his alpha now that he turned around and left him here? Terrified, he reached for Konnor, putting a hand on his arm.\\n\\n “Konnor…Master…please…”\\n\\n A spark seemed to leap between them at his touch and with a snarl on his lips, Konnor backed Ethan up to the wall. When he could go no further, Konnor slammed both hands on the wall beside his head and bared his teeth at him. “You were mine, damn you. Mine. And you ran from me.”\\n\\n Ethan flinched at the anger in his voice and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could say a word, Konnor lowered his mouth to take possession of Ethan’s. He was surprisingly gentle at first, running his tongue over Ethan’s lips.“This was mine.” He nipped at his bottom lip and Ethan gasped, opening to him. His tongue delved inside his mouth and swept over it, making Ethan weak in the knees.\\n\\n Ethan couldn’t be this close to his alpha without touching him one more time. He slid his arms around Konnor’s waist and held on tightly. Konnor moved his big body so it was pressing against every inch of Ethan’s. “You were mine,” he murmured against his lips. “Why did you leave me?” He pulled his head back and stared searchingly down into Ethan’s eyes.\\n\\n “I-I was afraid,” Ethan said. “I didn’t want to run from you.”\\n\\n “But you did,” Konnor said almost viciously, putting one hand around Ethan’s throat. “You left me and now you’re…” He looked down at Ethan’s bare body. “You’re like this.”\\n\\n He hauled him closer, crushing their mouths together. At the same time he tightened his grip around Ethan’s throat, ever so slightly, until Ethan couldn’t breathe, trapped against his alpha’s unyielding body and the solid wall behind him, he had nowhere to go to get away from the pressure on his throat. He relaxed his body, giving into it, not fighting it. Death at Konnor’s hand was much preferable to staying here and living like this. Black stars had just begun to dance behind his eyes when Konnor loosened his grip,and Ethan’s legs gave way.\\n\\n Konnor’s arm behind his knees scooped him up, and he carried him to the bed. Ethan’s eyes fluttered open,and he looked up into Konnor’s face, poised right over his.\\n\\n “From this moment on, you belong only to me, do you understand? I’m your alpha, your master. For now and always. You’re mine, damn you.”\\n\\n Ethan’s eyes shone up at him. “Yes, alpha. Yours…I belong to you.”\\n\\n “Fuck yes, you do,” he growled, and took Ethan’s lips in a fierce kiss that may have been meant to punish him, but though it was hurtful and harsh, it was also fucking wonderful and made his toes curl up.\\n\\n “I’m going to mate with you now, Ethan,” Konnor murmured against his lips. “No matter what you are, I have to have you. I’m giving you my knot, and you’ll belong to me forever. Forever, and no one will dare lay a hand on you again.” Despite the harsh words, Konnor lowered his gaze and took a deep, shuddering breath, as if he tried to calm himself. His next words were surprisingly gentle. “Is that…is that what you want?”\\n\\n “Y-yes,” Ethan said softly, his throat choked with emotion. He wanted this so much. This beautiful alpha wanted to own him, to possess him, and Ethan would belong to him forever. He yearned for it so much he began to tremble. “I want you, Master.”\\n\\n Konnor pulled away from him, but only for a moment. Ethan saw him fumble for something on the table by the bed. He found a tube of lubricant and turned Ethan over on his side. When he hesitated, Ethan looked at him over his shoulder and his lips tightened again. He touched the anal plug with a curse and then pulled itfrom Ethan’s ass and threw it across the room. Coating his fingers with lube, hecircled Ethan’s entrance, keeping eye contact with Ethan as he stared at Konnor over his shoulder. At the first touch of the cool lube as it entered his body, Ethan tensed. But when he looked into the eyes of his master, he relaxed again. He trusted Konnor—his alpha—totally. He tried to completely relax his body as the finger probed inside him, further stretching him. Even though the plug had stretched him some already, the burn of Konnor’s fingers made him jump a little. Soon Konnor was whispering in his ear.\\n\\n “Move your leg up. Push out, baby. That’s it.” And the burn lessened when he did. More lube and two more fingers, and he felt impossibly full, but he’d seen his mate’s dick. Had sucked it in his mouth, so he knew how large it was. He really didn’t think it would fit, especially if he gave him his knot, but he would try anything to please Konnor. He wanted to be able to do this for his master. He’d already disappointed him so much.\\n\\n Concentrating only on relaxing his body and pushing out as hard as he could, he was surprised to feel an amazing sensation as Konnor’s probing fingers found a spot inside him that lit him up like a torch. It was the same spot the plug had touched, but this was Konnor’s fingers. He felt like he was on fire and moved restlessly under his master’s touch. It hurt, but it felt so good all at the same time\\n\\n Konnor leaned down close to his ear and his breathing was fast and unsteady. Ethan saw that Konnor’s fangs had dropped, filling his mouth, and Ethan knew instinctively that he was having a hard time controlling his beast. “I’m going to bite you, Ethan.” He groaned into his ear, sending a little thrill of excitement down Ethan’s spine. “It may hurt at first, so hang on.”\\n\\n Konnor sank his fangs deep into the side of Ethan’s throat, and the pain at first was terrible. Ethan gasped and would have pulled away, but his master clutched him tightly around the chest, not letting him move. Then as the venom spread through his veins, he found himself writhing, not in pain, but in ecstasy. A powerful orgasm racked his body and his cum shot from his cock, splashing on his chest. He screamed and threw back his head so that it restedon Konnor’s shoulder. At the same time his orgasm hit, Konnor thrust into his hole, hard and fast and deep.\\n\\n He screamed again, and the scream became a howl. He realized that his howl was mingling with his mate’s, creating a chilling primal sound in the small room. Before he could even register the pain of being impaled on Konnor’s cock, his master took Ethan’s cock in his hand and began to pull the foreskin up and then push it back down rapidly. He’d never felt such exquisite torture. The spot inside him that Konnor touched was also being rubbed up and down, causing him to arch backward for more, but the pressure on his cock made him want to thrust forward. He didn’t know which way to go, and it was driving him crazy.\\n\\n He knew the knot would tie them together for long time, and he didn’t think he’d be able to stand much more. The venom was racing through his veins, making him hot all over. He broke out in a sweat as he felt another orgasm coming on fast. He couldn’t stop it, and it was too much sensation, too intense. He felt Konnor’s orgasm flooding him, the hot cum spilling out and running down the back of his thighs. Then he was falling into a deep, black pit and he cried out for Konnor to save him.\\n\\n “Let go,” he said, his voice deep and rumbling. “I’ve got you.” Ethan sank down into the darkness, and he wasn’t afraid, because he wasn’t alone. His master had him, and he’d never be alone again.\\n\\n Konnor opened the door to the room and motioned for Larssen to come in. He’d been dozing in the chair by the bed for some three hours now, and he rose stiffly, looking around him. His gaze swept the hallway, but no one seemed to be stirring. It was well past midnight.\\n\\n Larssen stepped inside and Konnor closed the door after him. Larssen glanced toward the bed where Ethan seemed to be fast asleep, covered in a blanket so only the top of his head was showing. Larssen leaned against the door frame and smiled. “Well, did you show him who’s boss?”\\n\\n Konnor frowned at him. “Very funny. I mated with him…it’s done.” Larssen’s eyebrows rose . “Already? I thought you might wait until we got him safely to the ship.”\\n\\n Konnor glanced back at the bed. “I couldn’t wait any longer. I didn’t mean to…”He sighed. “I couldn’t wait.”\\n\\n Larssen put a comforting hand on his brother’s shoulder. “Is he all right? I must admit I was shocked when I first saw him in the corridor.”\\n\\n “He seems all right. He’s not injured anywhere, physically. I can only imagine what he’s been through.” His face tightened in anger. “Damn it, if he’d only listened to me instead of running off like he did.”\\n\\n “Should I call the old bitch and give her the money for him?”\\n\\n “Yes, may as well. It might be better if I don’t see her again. I wasn’t sure I could hold onto my temper after she told me she’d broken him in.” He fairly spit the last words out of his mouth, and Larssen knew him well enough to know his stomach must be churning at the thought of the creature with his sweet boy.\\n\\n “Yes,” Larssen agreed, a little smirk on his lips. “I thought I was going to have to break up the fight. Don’t be hard on Ethan for it, though, Konnor. He couldn’t have helped what she did to him.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/konnor-and-his-omega-mate-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-3/page-11.html","bookId":1593,"book":{"id":1593,"title":"Konnor and His Omega Mate (Love Slaves of the Alphas #3)","description":"Storyline: Konnor and His Omega Mate (Love Slaves of the Alphas #3) \\n Ethan is having a really bad day.
