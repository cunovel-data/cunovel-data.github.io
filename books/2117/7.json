{"id":92838,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"11.00P.M., the first Friday in September, 1977: in Genoa Alec Kyle and Carl Quint were hurrying through rain- slick cobbled alleys toward their rendezvous with Felix Krakovitch at a dive called Frankie\u0027s Franchise.\n But seven hundred miles away in Devon, England, the time was 10.00 P.M. on a sultry Indian summer evening. At Harkley House, Yulian Bodescu lay naked on his back on the bed in his spacious garret room and considered the events of the last few days. In many ways they had been very satisfactory days, but they had been fraught with danger, too. He had not known the extent of his influence before, for the people at school and later Georgina had all been weak and hardly provided suitable yardsticks. The Lakes had been the true test, and Yulian had sailed through that with very little difficulty.\n George Lake had been the only real obstacle, but even that had been an accidental encounter, when Yulian wasn\u0027t quite ready for him. The youth smiled a slow smile and gently touched his shoulder. There was a dull ache there now, but that was all. And where was \u0027Uncle George\u0027 now? He was down in the vaults with his wife, Anne, that\u0027s where. Down where he belonged, with Viad standing guard on the door. Not that Yulian believed that to be absolutely necessary: it was a precaution, that\u0027s all. As for the Other: that had left its vat, gone into hiding in the earth where the cellars were darkest.\n Then there was Yulian\u0027s \u0027mother\u0027, Georgina. She was in her room, lost in self-pity, in her permanent state of terror. As she had been for the last year, since the time he did it to her. If she hadn\u0027t cut her hand that time it might never have happened. But she had, and then shown him the blood. Something had happened to him then - the same thing that happened every time he saw blood - but on this occasion it had been different. He had been unable to control it. When he had bandaged her hand, he\u0027d deliberately let something... something of himself, get into the wound. Georgina hadn\u0027t seen it, but Yuiian had. He had made it.\n She had been ill for a long time, and when she recovered... well, she had never really recovered. Not fully. And Yulian had known that it had grown in her, and that he was its master. She had known it too, which was what terrified her.\n His \u0027mother\u0027, yes. Actually, Yulian had never considered her his mother at all. He had come out of her, he knew that, but he\u0027d always felt that he was more the son of a father - but not a father in the ordinary sense of the word. The son of... of something else. Which was why this evening he had asked her (as he\u0027d asked her a hundred times before) about Ilya Bodescu, and about the way he died, and where he died. And to make sure he got the entire story in every last detail, this time he\u0027d hypnotised her into the deepest possible trance.\n And as Georgina had told him how it had been, so his mind had been lured east, across oceans and mountains and plains, over fields and cities and rivers, to a place which had always existed in the innermost eye of his mind; a place of hills and woods and... and yes, that was it! A place of low wooded hills in the shape of a cross. The cruciform hills. A place he would have to visit. Very soon. .\n He would have to, for that\u0027s where the answer lay. He was in thrall to that place as much as the rest of them in the house were in thrall to him, which was to say totally.\n And the strength of its seduction was just as great. It was a strength he had not realised until George had come back. Back from his grave in Blagdon cemetery, back from the dead. At first that had been a shock - then an all-consuming curiosity - finally a revelation! For it had told Yulian what he was. Not who he was but what. And certainly he was more than merely the son of Ilya and Georgina Bodescu.\n Yulian knew that he was not entirely human, that a large part of him was utterly inhuman, and the knowledge thrilled him. He could hypnotise people to do his will, whatever he desired. He could produce new life, of a sort, out of himself. He could change living beings, people, into creatures like himself. Oh, they did not have his strength, his weird talents, but that was all to the good. The change made them his slaves, made him their absolute master.\n More, he was a necromancer: he could open up dead bodies and learn the secrets of their lives. He knew how to prowl like a cat, swim like a fish, savage like a dog. The thought had occurred to him that given wings he might even fly - like a bat. Like a vampire bat!\n Beside him on a bedside table lay a hardback book titled The Vampire in Fact and Fiction. Now he reached out a slender hand to touch its cover, trace the figure of a bat in flight impressed into the black binding cloth. Absorbing, certainly - but the title was a lie, as were the contents. Much of the alleged fiction was fact (Yulian was the living proof), and some of the supposed fact was fiction.\n Sunlight, for instance. It didn\u0027t kill. It might, if he should ever be foolish enough to stretch himself out in a sheltered cove in midsummer for more than a minute or two. It must be some sort of chemical reaction, he thought. Photophobia was common enough even among ordinary men. Mushrooms grow best-under a covering of straw through foggy, late September nights. And he\u0027d read somewhere that in Cyprus one can find the selfsame edible species, except they never break the surface. They push up the parched earth until cracks appear, which tell the locals where to find them. They didn\u0027t much care for sunlight, mushrooms, but it wouldn\u0027t kill them. No, Yulian was wary of the sun but not afraid of it. It was a question of being careful, that\u0027s all.\n As for sleeping through the day in a coffin full of native soil: sheer fallacy. He did occasionally sleep during the day, but that was because he often spent much of the night deep in thought, or prowling the estate. He preferred night, true, because then, in the darkness or in the moonlight, he felt closer to his source, closer to understanding the true nature of his being.\n Then there was the vampire\u0027s lust for blood: false, at least in Yulian\u0027s case. Oh, the sight of blood aroused him, did things to him internally, worked him into a passion; but drinking it from a victim\u0027s veins was hardly the delight described in the various fictions. He did like rare meat, however, and plenty of it, and had never been much of a one for greens. On the other hand, the thing Yulian had grown in the vat in the cellar, that had thrived on blood! On blood, flesh, anything animate or ex-animate. On flesh or the red juice of flesh, alive or dead! It didn\u0027t need to eat, Yulian knew, but it would if it could. It would have absorbed George, too, if he hadn\u0027t been there to stop it.\n The Other... Yulian shuddered deliciously. It knew him for its master, but that was its sum total of knowledge. He had grown it from himself, and remembered how that had come about:\n Just after he\u0027d been expelled from school, the first of what he had always supposed to be his adult teeth had come loose. It was a back tooth and painful. But he wouldn\u0027t see a dentist. Working and worrying at it, one -night he\u0027d broken the thread. And he\u0027d examined the tooth closely, finding it curious that this was part of himself which had been shed. White bone and a thread of gristle, the red root. He\u0027d put it in a saucer on the window ledge of his bedroom. But in the morning he heard it clatter to the floor. The core had put out tiny white rootlets, and the tooth was dragging itself like a hermit crab out of the morning light.\n Yulian\u0027s teeth, except the back ones, had always been sharp as knives and chisel-tipped, but human teeth for all that. Certainly not animal teeth. The one which had pushed out the lost one was anything but human. It was a fang. Since then most of his teeth had been replaced, and the new ones were all fangs. Especially the eye-teeth. His jaws had changed too, to accommodate them.\n Sometimes he thought: perhaps I\u0027m the cause of this change in myself. Maybe I\u0027m making it happen. Willing it. Mind over matter. Because I\u0027m evil.\n Georgina had used to say that to him sometimes, tell him he was evil. That was when he was small and she still had a measure of control over him, when he\u0027d done things she didn\u0027t like. When he\u0027d first started to experiment with his necromancy. Ah, but there\u0027d been many things she hadn\u0027t liked since then!\n Georgina - \u0027mother\u0027 - terror stricken chicken penned with a fox cub, watching him grow sleek and strong. For as Yulian had grown older, so the element of control had changed, passed into his hands. It was his eyes; he only had to look at her with those eyes of his and... and she was powerless. The teachers and pupils at his school, too. And with use, so he\u0027d become expert in hypnotism. Practice makes perfect. To that extent, at least, the book was correct: the vampire is quite capable of mesmerising its prey.\n But what about mortality - or immortality, undeath? That was still a puzzle, a mystery - but it was one he\u0027d soon resolve. Now that he had George there was very little he couldn\u0027t resolve. For George was still in large part a man. Returned from the grave, undead, yes, but his flesh was still a man\u0027s flesh. And that which was within him couldn\u0027t have grown very large in so short a time. Unlike the Other, which had had plenty of time.\n Yulian had, of course, experimented with the Other. His experiments had told him very little, but it was better than nothing. According to the fiction, vampires were supposed to succumb to the sharpened stake. The Other ignored the stake, seemed impervious to it. Trying to stake it was like trying to leave an imprint on water. The Other could be solid enough at times: it could form teeth, rudimentary hands, even eyes. But in the main its tissues were protoplasmic, gelatinous. And as for putting a stake through its \u0027heart\u0027 or cutting off its \u0027head\u0027 .\n And yet it wasn\u0027t indestructible, it wasn\u0027t immortal. It could die, could be killed. Yulian had burned part of it in an incinerator down there in the cellars. And by God - if there was a God, which Yulian doubted - it hadn\u0027t liked that! He was perfectly sure that he wouldn\u0027t have liked it either. And that was a thought which occasionally worried him: if ever he were discovered, if men found out what\n he was, would they try to burn him? He supposed they -would. But who could possibly find him out? And if\n someone did, who would believe it? The police weren\u0027t much likely to listen to a story about vampires, now were they? On the other hand, what with the local \u0027satanic cult\u0027, maybe they were!\n Again he smiled his awful smile. It was funny now, but it hadn\u0027t been at all funny when the police came knocking at the door the day after George came back. He had very nearly made a serious mistake then, had gone too quickly on his guard, on the defensive. But of course they\u0027d put his nervousness down to the recent loss of his \u0027uncle\u0027. If only they\u0027d been able to know the truth, that in fact George Lake was right under their feet, whining and shivering in the cellars. And even so, what could they have done about it? It was hardly Yulian\u0027s fault that George wouldn\u0027t lie still, was it?\n And that was another part of the legend which was a fact: that when a vampire killed a victim in a certain way, then that victim would return as one of the undead. Three nights George had lain there, and on the fourth he\u0027d clawed his way out. A mere man buried alive could never have done it, but the vampire in him had given George all the strength he needed and more. The vampire which had been part of the Other, which had put one of its pseudohands into him and stopped George\u0027s heart. The Other which had been part of Yulian, in fact Yulian\u0027s tooth.\n What a torn and bloodied state George had been in when Yulian opened the door to him that night. And how the house had rung to his demented sobbing and shrieking, until Yulian had grown angry with him, told him to be quiet and locked him in the cellar. And there he\u0027d stayed.\n Yulian watched the silver light of the moon creeping through a crack in his curtains, channelled his thoughts anew. What had he been recounting? Ah, yes, the police.\n They had come to report a shocking crime, the illegal opening of George Lake\u0027s grave by person or persons unknown, and the theft of his corpse. Was Mrs Lake still residing at Harkley House?\n Why, yes she was, but she was still suffering from the shock of her husband\u0027s death. If it wasn\u0027t absolutely necessary that they see her, Yulian would prefer to break the news to her himself. But who could be responsible for so despicable a crime?\n Well, sir, we do believe we\u0027ve got one of them there cults at work in these here parts, despoiling graveyards and the like and holding, er, sabbats? Druids or some such. Devil worshippers, you know? But this time they\u0027ve gone too far! Don\u0027t you worry, sir, we\u0027ll get \u0027em in the end. But do break it easy to his missus, all right?\n Of course, of course. And thank you for bringing us this news, terrible though it is. I certainly don\u0027t envy you your job.\n All in a day\u0027s work, sir. Sorry we\u0027ve nothing good to report, that\u0027s all. Good night to you .\n And that was that.\n But again he had strayed, and once more he was obliged to focus his thoughts back on the \u0027legend\u0027 of the vampire. Mirrors: vampires hated mirrors because they had no reflections. False - and yet in a way true. Yulian did have a reflection; but sometimes, looking in a glass, especially at night, he saw far more than others could see. For he knew what he was looking at, that it was something alien to man. And he had wondered: if others saw him like that, reflected in a glass, would they too see the real thing, the monster behind the man?\n And lastly there was the vampire\u0027s lust, the way he sated himself on women. Now Yulian had tasted the blood - and more than the blood - of women, and had found it rich as deep red wine. It excited him as all blood did, but not so much that he\u0027d glut himself on it. Georgina, Anne, Helen - he\u0027d tried the blood of all three. And certainly, in good time, he would try the blood of many more.\n But his attitude towards taking blood puzzled him. If he were a true vampire, surely blood would be the driving force of his life. And yet it wasn\u0027t. Perhaps his metamorphosis wasn\u0027t yet complete. Perhaps, as the change waxed in him, so the human part would wane, disappear altogether. And then he\u0027d become a vampire full-blown. Or full-blooded?\n Lust, yes... but there was more to lust than mere blood-lust. Much more. And little wonder the women in the fiction succumbed so readily to the vampire\u0027s charms. Especially after the first time. Hah! What woman had ever truly felt fulfilled in the arms of a man? Not one! They only thought they had because they didn\u0027t know better. What, \u0027fulfilled\u0027? Filled full? By a mere man? Utterly impossible! But by a vampire .\n Yulian turned a little on to his side and gazed in the moon-pierced darkness of his room at the girl beside him. Cousin Helen. She was very beautiful and had been very innocent. Not quite pure, but very nearly. Who it was took her virginity... but what did that matter? In fact he had taken nothing, and he had given very little. They had been fumbling lovers for an hour.\n But now? Now she knew what it was to be \u0027fulfilled\u0027. Indeed, she knew that if Yulian willed it he could fill her to bursting - literally!\n A chuckle rose in his throat, formed on his lips like a bubble of bile. Oh,yes, for the Other wasn\u0027t the only one who could put out pseudopod extensions of himself! Yulian held back the laughter he felt welling inside, reached out a hand and with a deceptive gentleness stroked Helen\u0027s cool, rounded flank.\n Even deeply asleep and dreaming the dreams of the damned, still she shuddered under the touch of his hand. Gooseflesh appeared and her breathing rapidly mounted to a moaning pant. She whined in her hypnotic sleep like a thin wind through a cracked board. Her hypnotic sleep, yes. The power of hypnotism, and that of telepathy which was its kin.\n Nowhere in the literature - except for the occasional hint in some of the better fictions - had Yulian discovered mention of the vampire\u0027s control of others by will and the reading of minds at a distance; and yet this, too, was one of his powers. It was very inchoate as yet, as were all his talents, but it was also very real. Once touched by Yulian, once invaded by him physically, then his victim was an open book to him, even at a distance. Even now, if he reached out his mind in a certain way... there! Those were the dull, vacuous \u0027thoughts\u0027 of the Other. No, not even that: he had merely touched upon the Other\u0027s instinctive sense of being, a sort of basic animal awareness. The Other was aware of himself - itself? - in much the same way as an amoeba is aware; and because it had been part of him, Yulian could sense that awareness.\n Now that he had taken or used Helen, Anne, George and Georgina, why, he could sense all of them! He let his exterior thoughts leave the Other and wander, and\n and there was Anne, asleep in some cold, damp corner down there in the dark. And there, too, was George. Except that George was not asleep.\n George. Yulian knew he would soon have to do something about George. He wasn\u0027t behaving as he should. There was an obstinacy in him. Oh, he\u0027d been completely under Yulian\u0027s control in the beginning, just like the women. But just recently .\n Yulian focused on George\u0027s mind, wormed his way silently into his thoughts and - a pit of black hatred shot with flashes of red rage! Lust, too - a bestial lust Yulian could scarce believe - and not only for blood but also. .\n revenge?\n Frowning, Yulian withdrew his mind before George could sense him. Obviously he would have to deal with his uncle sooner than he\u0027d thought. He had already decided to make use of him - knew how he would use him - but now he must set a definite date on it. Like tomorrow. He left the unsuspecting undead creature raging and prowling the cellars, and - What was that?\n Hair prickling at the nape of his neck, Yulian swung his legs down to the floor and stood up. It hadn\u0027t been one of the women, and he\u0027d only just left George, so who had it been? Someone close by was thinking thoughts about Harkley House, thoughts about Yulian himself! He went to the curtains, opened them six inches, stared anxiously out at the night.\n Out there, the estate. The old derelict buildings, gravel path, shrubbery and copse; the high perimeter wall and gate; the road beyond the gate, a ribbon of light under the moon, and beyond that a tall hedge. Yulian wrinkled his nose, sniffed suspiciously like a dog at a stranger. Oh, yes, a stranger - there! In the hedgerow, that glint of moonlight on glass, the dull red glow of a cigarette\u0027s tip. Someone in the shadow of the hedge, watching Harkley. Watching Yulian!\n Now, knowing where to aim, he redirected his thoughts\n - and met the mind of the stranger! But only for a moment, the merest instant of time. Then mental shutters came down like the jaws of a steel trap. The glint of spectacles or binoculars disappeared, the cigarette\u0027s glow was extinguished, and the man himself, the merest shadow, was gone.\n Vlad! Yulian commanded instinctively. Go, find him. Whoever he is, bring him to me!\n And down in the brambles and undergrowth near the door to the vaults, where he lay half asleep, VIad at once came alert, turned his sensitive ears towards the drive and the gate, sprang up and set off at a loping run. Deep in his throat, a growl not quite a dog\u0027s growl rumbled like dull thunder.\n Darcy Clarke was doing late shift on the Harkley place. He was a psychic sensitive with a high degree of telepathic potential. Also, he was big on self-preservation. A freakish automatic talent, over which he had no conscious control, was always on guard to keep him \u0027safe\u0027; he was the opposite of accident prone and led a \u0027charmed\u0027 life. Which on this occasion was just as well.\n Clarke was young, only twenty-five, but what he lacked in years he more than made up for in zeal. He would have made a perfect soldier, for his duty was his all. It was that duty which had kept him here in the vicinity of Harkley House from 5.00 till 11.00 P.M. And it was exactly on the dot of 11.00 P.M. that he saw the crack of the curtains widen a little in one of Harkley\u0027s dormer windows.\n That in itself was nothing. There were five people in that house and God-knows-what else, and no reason at all why it shouldn\u0027t show signs of life. With a grimace, Clarke quickly corrected himself: signs of undeath? Fully briefed, he knew that Harkley\u0027s inhabitants were something other than they seemed. But as he adjusted his nite-lite binoculars on the window, suddenly there was something else, a realisation that struck at Clarke like a bolt of lightning.\n He had known, of course, that someone in there, probably the youth, was psychically endowed. That had been obvious for the last four days, ever since Clarke and the others first clapped eyes on the place. To any half-talented sensitive the old house would reek of strangeness. And not just strangeness, evil! Tonight, as darkness fell, Clarke had sensed it growing stronger, the wash of dark emanations flowing from the house like mental sewage. Until now he\u0027d simply let it flow right past him, without touching, but as that dark figure had come into view behind the crack in the curtains, and as he\u0027d focussed his binoculars upon it - -\n - Something had been there in his head, touching on his mind. A talent at least as strong as his own, probing his thoughts! But it wasn\u0027t the talent that surprised him - that was a game he\u0027d played before with his colleagues at INTESP, where they practised constantly to break in on each other\u0027s thoughts - it was the sheer unbridled animal animosity that caused him to gasp, draw back a little, slam shut the doors on his ESP-endowed consciousness. The gurgling black whirlpool bog of the invading mind.\n And because he had set up defences, so he failed to detect any hint of the physical threat, the orders Yulian had issued to his black Alsatian. He had failed, but his primary talent - the one no one as yet understood - was not failing him. It was 11.00 P.M. and his instructions were quite clear: he\u0027d go back now to his temporary surveillance HO at a hotel in Paignton and make his report. The watch on the house would begin again at 6.00 A.M. tomorrow, when a colleague of Clarke\u0027s would take it up. He tossed his cigarette down, ground it out under his heel, pocketed his nite-lites.\n Clarke\u0027s car was parked in a layby where the hedge and fence were cut back twenty-five yards down the road. He was on the field side of the hedge. He put his hand on the top bar preparatory to climbing over to the road, then thought better of it. Though he didn\u0027t know it, that was his hidden talent coming into play. Instead of climbing the fence, he hurried through the long grass at the edge of the field towards his car. The grass was wet where it whipped his trousers, but he ignored it. It saved time this way and he was in a hurry now, eager to be away from the place. Only natural, he supposed, considering what he\u0027d just learned. And he hardly gave it a thought that by the time he got to his car he was almost running.\n But it was then, as he fumbled the key into the lock and turned it, that he heard something else running: the faint scuff of padded feet slapping the road, the scrabble of claws as something heavy jumped the fence back there where he\u0027d been standing. Then he was into the car, slamming the door behind him, eyes wide and heart thumping as he gazed back into the night.\n And two seconds later Viad hit the car!\n He hit so hard, with forepaws, shoulder and head, that the glass of the window in Clarke\u0027s door was starred into a cobweb pattern. The impact had sounded like a hammer blow, and Clarke knew that one more charge like that would shatter the glass to fragments and leave him totally unprotected. But he\u0027d seen who, or what, his assailant was, and he had no intention of sitting here immobile and just waiting for it to happen.\n Clarke turned the key in the ignition, revved, reversed a skidding three feet to bring the bonnet free of overhanging branches. Vlad\u0027s second spring, aimed again at Clarke\u0027s window, sent the dog sprawling on the bonnet directly in front of the windscreen. And now the young esper saw just how fortunate his escape had been. Out in the open - there was little he could have done against that!\n Viad\u0027s face was a savage black mask of hatred, a contorted, snarling, saliva-flecked visage of madness! Yellow eyes spotted with crimson pupils glared through the glass at Clarke with such a burning intensity that he almost fancied he could feel their heat. Then he was into first gear and skidding out on to the road.\n As the car jerked and slewed forward, so the dog\u0027s feet were jolted from under him. He crashed over on to his side on the bonnet and was sent sprawling into the darkness of the hedgerow as Clarke straightened the car up and sent it careening along the road. In his rearview mirror, he saw the dog emerge from the hedge and shake itself, glaring after the speeding car. Then Clarke was round a bend and Vlad lost to sight.\n That wasn\u0027t something he felt sorry about. Indeed, he was still shaking when he switched off the car\u0027s engine in the hotel car park in Paignton. Following which... he flopped back in his seat and wearily lit a cigarette, which he smoked right down to the cork tip before securing the car and going in to make his report Frankie\u0027s Franchise was wall to wall sleazy. It was a place for habitual wharf-rats, prostitutes and their pimps, pushers and Genoese low-life in general. And it was noisy. An old American juke-box, back in fashion, was blasting Little Richard\u0027s raw \u0027Tutti Frutti\u0027 across the main room like a gale force wind. There was no smallest corner of the place that escaped the music\u0027s blast, but in any one of the half-dozen arched alcoves you could at least hear yourself think. That was why Frankie\u0027s was so ideally suitable: you couldn\u0027t concentrate enough to hear anyone else think.\n Alec Kyle and Carl Quint, Felix Krakovitch and Sergei Gulharov, sat at a small square table with their backs to the protective alcove walls. East and West faced each other across their drinks. Curiously, on the one side Kyle and Quint drank vodka, and on the other Krakovitch and Gulharov sipped American beers.\n Identifying each other had been the easiest thing in the world: in Frankie\u0027s Franchise, no one else fitted the prescribed picture at all. But personal appearance wasn\u0027t the only yardstick; for of course, even in the hubbub, the three sensitives were able to detect each other\u0027s psychic auras. They had made their acknowledgement with nods of their heads, picked their way with their drinks from the bar to an empty alcove. Certain of the club\u0027s regulars had given them curious glances: the hard men a little wary, narrow-eyed, the prostitutes speculative. They had not returned them.\n Seated for a few moments, finally Krakovitch had opened the discussion. \u0027I don\u0027t suppose you speaking my language,\u0027 he said, his voice heavily but not unpleasantly accented, \u0027but I speaking yours. But badly. This my friend Sergei.\u0027 He tipped his head sideways a little to indicate his companion. \u0027He know a little, very little, English. He not have ESP.\u0027\n Kyle and Quint glanced obediently at Gulharov. What they saw was a moderately handsome young man with close-cropped blond hair, grey eyes, hard-looking hands where they lay loosely crossed on the table, enclosing his drink. He seemed uneasy in his modern Western clothes, which weren\u0027t quite the right fit.\n \u0027That\u0027s true enough.\u0027 Quint narrowed his eyes, turning back to Krakovitch. \u0027He\u0027s not skilled that way, but I\u0027m sure he has many other worthwhile talents.\u0027 Krakovitch smiled thinly and nodded. He seemed a little sour.\n Kyle had been studying Krakovitch, committing him to memory. The Russian head of ESPionage was in his late thirties. He had thinning black hair, piercing green eyes and an almost gaunt, hollow face. He was of medium height, slimly built. A skinned rabbit, thought Kyle. But his thin, pale lips were firm, and the high dome of his head spoke of a rare intelligence.\n Krakovitch\u0027s impression of Kyle was much the same: a man just a few years younger than himself, intelligent, talented. It was only the physical side of Kyle that was different, which hardly mattered. Kyle\u0027s hair was brown and plentiful, naturally wavy. He was well fleshed, even a little overweight, but with his height that scarcely showed. His eyes were brown as his hair, his teeth even and white in a too-wide mouth that sloped a little from left to right. In another face that look might well be mistaken for cynicism, but not in Kyle, Krakovitch thought.\n Quint, on the other hand, was more aggressive, but he probably had superb self-control. He would reach conclusions quickly, right or wrong. And he would probably act on them. He would act, and hope he\u0027d done the right thing. But he wouldn\u0027t feel guilty if it turned out wrong. Also, there wasn\u0027t much emotion in Quint. All of this showed in his face, his figure, and Krakovitch prided himself on reading character. Quint was lithe, built like a cat. In no way massive, but he had that coiled spring look about him. Not nervous tension, just a natural ability to think and act fast. He had eyes of disarming blue that took in everything, a thin, even nose, and a forehead creased from frowning. He too was in his mid-thirties, thin on top, dark featured. And he had a talent. Krakovitch could tell that Quint was extremely ESP-sensitive. He was a spotter.\n \u0027Oh, Sergei Gulharov has been trained - , Krakovitch finally answered, \u0027 - as my bodyguard. But not in your arts, or mine. He has not got that kind of mind. Indeed, of the four of us, I could argue that he is the only \"normal\" man present. Which is unfortunate,\u0027 - now he stared accusingly at Kyle - \u0027for you and I were supposed to meet as equals, without, er, backup?\u0027\n At that moment the music went quiet, the rock\u0027n\u0027roll replaced by an Italian ballad.\n \u0027Krakovitch,\u0027 said Kyle, hard-eyed now and keeping his voice low, \u0027we\u0027d better be straight on this. You\u0027re right, our deal was that the two of us should meet. We could each bring along a second. But no telepaths. What we have to say to each other we\u0027ll just say, without someone picking our thoughts. Quint isn\u0027t a telepath, he\u0027s a spotter, that\u0027s all. So we weren\u0027t cheating. And as far as your man here - er, Gulharov? - is concerned: Quint says he\u0027s clean, so you aren\u0027t cheating either. Or you wouldn\u0027t appear to be - but your third man is something else!\u0027\n \u0027My third man?\u0027 Krakovitch sat up straight, seemed genuinely surprised. \u0027I have no -\u0027\n \u0027But you do,\u0027 Quint cut in. \u0027KGB. We\u0027ve seen him. In fact, he\u0027s here in Frankie\u0027s Franchise right now.\n That was news to Kyle. He looked at Quint. \u0027You\u0027re certain?\u0027\n Quint nodded. \u0027Don\u0027t look now, but he\u0027s sitting in the corner over there with a Genoese whore. He\u0027s changed his clothes, too, and looks like he\u0027s just off a ship. Not a bad cover - but I recognised him the moment we walked in here.\u0027\n Out of the corner of his eye Krakovitch looked, then slowly shook his head. \u0027I do not know him,\u0027 he said. \u0027Not to be surprised. I do not know any of them. I dislike - strongly! But... you are sure? How can you be so sure?\u0027\n Kyle would have been caught on the hop, but not Quint. \u0027We run the same sort of branch as the one you run, Comrade,\u0027 he stated flatly. \u0027Except we have the edge on you. We\u0027re better at it. He\u0027s KGB, all right.\u0027\n Krakovitch\u0027s fury was obvious. Not against Quint but the position in which he now found himself. \u0027Intolerable!\u0027 he snapped. \u0027Why, the Party Leader himself has given me his - \u0027 He half stood up, half turned towards the man indicated, a thick-set barrel of a man in rough and ready suit and open-necked shirt. His neck must be at least as thick as Krakovitch\u0027s thigh! Fortunately he was looking the other way, talking to the prostitute.\n Before Krakovitch could carry it any further, Kyle said, \u0027I believe you - that you don\u0027t know him. It was done behind your back. So sit down, act naturally. Anyway, it\u0027s obvious we can\u0027t talk here. Apart from the fact that we\u0027re being watched, it\u0027s too damned noisy. And Christ, for all we know there might even be someone listening in on us!\u0027\n Krakovitch abruptly sat down. He looked startled, glanced nervously about. \u0027Bugged?\u0027 He remembered how his old boss, Borowitz, had had a thing about electronic surveillance.\n \u0027We could be.\u0027 Quint gave a sharp nod. \u0027This one either followed you here or he knew in advance where we were going to meet.\u0027\n Krakovitch gave a snort. \u0027This getting out of hand. I no good at this. What now?\u0027\n Kyle looked at Krakovitch and knew he wasn\u0027t faking it. He grinned. \u0027I\u0027m no good at it either. Listen, I\u0027m like you, Felix. I prognosticate. I don\u0027t know your word for it. I, er, foretell the future? I occasionally get fairly accurate pictures of how things are going to be. Do you understand?\u0027\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Krakovitch. \u0027My talent almost exactly. Except I usually get warnings. So?\u0027\n \u0027So I saw us getting along OK together. How about you?\u0027\n Krakovitch heaved a sigh of relief. \u0027I also,\u0027 he shrugged. \u0027At least, no bad warnings.\u0027 Time was running out for the Russian and there were things he desperately needed to know, questions he must have answered. This Englishman might be the only one who could answer them. \u0027So what we do about it?\u0027\n Quint said, \u0027Wait.\u0027 He got up, crossed to the bar, ordered fresh drinks. He also spoke to the bartender. Then he came back with drinks on a tray. \u0027When we get the nod from the bloke behind the bar we pile out of here fast,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Kyle was puzzled.\n \u0027Taxi,\u0027 said Quint, smiling tightly. \u0027I\u0027ve ordered one. We\u0027ll go to... the airport! Why not? On the way we can talk. At the airport we find a warm, comfortable place in the arrivals lounge and carry on talking. Even if our pal over there manages to follow us he won\u0027t dare get too close. And if he does show up we\u0027ll take a taxi somewhere else.\u0027\n \u0027Good!\u0027 said Krakovitch.\n Five minutes later their taxi came and all four exited at speed. Kyle was last out. Looking back, he saw the KGB man come slowly to his feet, saw his face twisting in anger and frustration.\n In the taxi they talked, and at the airport. They started talking at about twenty minutes before midnight and finished at 2.30 A.M. Kyle did most of it, aided by Quint, with Krakovitch listening intently and only breaking in here and there to confirm or ask for an explanation of something that had been said.\n Kyle started with these words:\n \u0027Harry Keogh was our best. He had talents no one ever had before. A lot of them. He told me everything I\u0027m going to tell you. If you believe what I tell you, we can help you with some big problems you\u0027ve got in Russia and Romania. In helping you, we\u0027ll also be helping ourselves, for we\u0027ll learn by experience. Now then, do you want to know about Borowitz and how he died? About Max Batu and how he died? About the... the fossil men, who wrecked the Ch\u0026acirc;teau Bronnitsy that night? I can tell you all of those things. More importantly, I can tell you about Dragosani. .\n And nearly three hours later he finished with these:\n \u0027So, Dragosani was a vampire. And there are more of them. You have them, and we have them. We know where at least one of yours is. Or if not a vampire, something a vampire left behind. Which could be just as bad. Whichever, it has to be destroyed. We can help if you\u0027ll let us. Call it what you like - d��tente, while we deal with a mutual threat? But if you don\u0027t want our help, then you\u0027ll have to do the job yourself. But we\u0027d like to help, because that way we might learn something. Face it, Felix, this is bigger than East-West political squabbling. We\u0027d work together if it was plague, wouldn\u0027t we? Drug trafficking? Ships in trouble at sea? Of course we would. And I\u0027m admitting right here and now, our own problem back in England might be bigger than we know. The more we learn from you, the better our chances. The better all of our chances. .\n Krakovitch had been silent for a long time. At last he said: \u0027You want to come to USSR with me and... and put this thing down?\u0027\n \u0027Not the USSR - \u0027 said Quint. \u0027Romania. That\u0027s still your territory.\u0027\n \u0027The two of you? Both the leader, and a high-ranking member of your E-Branch? Is that not to be the big risks?\u0027\n Kyle shook his head. \u0027Not from you. At least I don\u0027t think so. Anyway, we all have to start trusting someone somewhere. We\u0027ve already started, so why not go all the way?\u0027\n Krakovitch nodded. \u0027And afterwards, I perhaps come with you? See what kind problem you have?\u0027\n \u0027If you wish.\u0027\n Krakovitch pondered it. \u0027You tell me a lot,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you solve some big problems for me, maybe. But you not say where exactly this thing in Romania.\u0027\n \u0027If you want to go it alone,\u0027 said Kyle, \u0027I will tell you. Not exactly, for I don\u0027t know exactly, but close enough that you\u0027ll be able to find it. Working together we might do it a lot faster, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Also,\u0027 Krakovitch was still thinking it out, \u0027you not say how you knowing all of this. Hard to accept all I hear without I know how you know.\u0027\n \u0027Harry Keogh told me,\u0027 said Kyle.\n \u0027Keogh is dead a long time now,\u0027 said Krakovitch.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Quint cut in, \u0027but he told us everything right up to the time he died.\u0027\n \u0027Ah?\u0027 Krakovitch drew breath sharply. \u0027He was that good? Such talent in a telepath must be... very rare.\u0027\n \u0027Unique!\u0027 said Kyle.\n \u0027And your lot killed him!\u0027 Quint accused.\n Krakovitch quickly turned to him. \u0027Dragosani killed him. And he killed Dragosani - almost.\u0027\n It was Kyle\u0027s turn to gasp. \u0027Almost? Are you saying that - \u0027\n Krakovitch held up a hand. \u0027I finish the job Keogh started,\u0027 he said. \u0027I tell you about that. But first: you say Keogh in contact right until the end?\u0027\n Kyle wanted to say, he still is! But that was a secret best kept. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he answered.\n \u0027Then you can describe what happen that night?\u0027\n \u0027In detail,\u0027 said Kyle. \u0027Would that satisfy you that the rest of what I\u0027ve said is the truth?\u0027\n Krakovitch slowly nodded.\n \u0027They came out of the night and the falling snow,\u0027 Kyle began. \u0027Zombies, men dead for four hundred years, and Harry their leader. Bullets couldn\u0027t stop them, for they were already dead. Cut them down with machine-gun fire, and the bits kept right on coming. They got into your defensive positions, your pillboxes. They pulled the pins on grenades, fought with their old rusty weapons, their swords and axes. They were Tartars, fearless, and made more fearless by the fact that they couldn\u0027t die twice. Keogh wasn\u0027t just a telepath; amongst his other talents, he could also teleport! He did - right into Dragosani\u0027s control room. He took a couple of his Tartars with him. That was where he and Dragosani had it out, while in the rest of the Ch\u0026acirc;teau - \u0027\n \u0027 - In the rest of the Ch\u0026acirc;teau,\u0027 Krakovitch took up the story, his face deathly white, \u0027it was... hell! I was there.\n I lived through it. A few others with me. The rest died - horribly! Keogh was... some kind of monster. He could call up the dead!\u0027\n \u0027Not as big a monster as Dragosani,\u0027 said Kyle. \u0027But you were going to tell me what happened after Keogh died. How you finished off the job he started. What did you mean by that?\u0027\n \u0027Dragosani was a vampire,\u0027 Krakovitch nodded, almost to himself. \u0027Yes, you are right, of course.\u0027 He got a grip of himself. \u0027Look, Sergei here was with me when we clean up what was left of Dragosani. Let me show you what happen when I remind him about that - and when I tell to him there are more of them.\u0027 He turned to his silent companion, spoke to him rapidly in Russian.\n They were sitting at a scruffy bar lit by flickering neon in the airport\u0027s almost deserted night arrivals lounge. The barman had gone off duty two hours earlier and their glasses had stood empty ever since. Gulharov\u0027s reaction to what Krakovitch told him was immediate and vehement. He went white and drew back from his boss, almost falling from his barstool. And as Krakovitch finished speaking, so he slammed his empty beer glass down on the bar.\n \u0027Nyet, nyet!\u0027 he gasped his denial, his face working with a strange mixture of fury and loathing. And then, his voice gradually rising and growing shrill, he began a diatribe in Russian which would soon attract attention.\n Krakovitch gripped his arm and shook him, and Gulharov\u0027s jabbering faded into silence. \u0027Now I ask him if we accepting your help,\u0027 Krakovitch informed. He spoke to the younger man again, and this time Gulharov nodded twice, rapidly, and his colour began to return to normal.\n \u0027Da, da!\u0027 he gasped emphatically. His throat made a dry rattle as he added something else, unintelligible to the two Englishmen.\n Krakovitch smiled humourlessly. \u0027He says we should accept all the help we can get,\u0027 he translated. \u0027Because we have to kill these things - finish them! And I agreeing with him...\u0027 Then he told these strangest of allies all that had happened at the Ch\u0026acirc;teau Bronnitsy after Harry Keogh\u0027s war.\n When he\u0027d finished there was a long silence, broken at last by Quint. \u0027We\u0027re in agreement, then? That we\u0027ll act together on this?\u0027\n Krakovitch nodded. He shrugged, said simply, \u0027No alternative. And no time to waste.\u0027\n Quint turned to Kyle. \u0027But how do we go about it?\u0027\n \u0027As far as possible,\u0027 Kyle answered, \u0027we go the straightforward way. We get it all right up front, without any of the usual - , The airport tannoy broke in on him, echoing tinnily as some sleepy, unseen announcer requested in English that a Mr A. Kyle please take a telephone call at the reception desk.\n Krakovitch\u0027s face froze. Who would know that Kyle was here?\n Kyle stood up, shrugged apologetically. This was very embarrassing. It could only be \u0027Brown\u0027, and how to explain that to Krakovitch? Quint, on the other hand, was his usual ready-for-anything self. Calmly he said to Krakovitch, \u0027Well, you have your little bloodhound following you about. And now it would seem that we have one too.\u0027\n Krakovitch gave a curt, sour nod. And with an edge of \u0027sarcasm, echoing Kyle, he said, \u0027Without any of the usual, eh? Did you know about this?\u0027\n \u0027it\u0027s none of our doing.\u0027 Quint wasn\u0027t exactly truthful. We\u0027re in the same boat as you.\u0027\n On Krakovitch\u0027s orders, Gulharov accompanied Kyle to the reception-cum-enquiries desk, leaving .Quint and Krakovitch alone together. \u0027Maybe this is all in our favour,\u0027 said Quint.\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Krakovitch had turned sour again. \u0027We are followed, spied upon, overheard, bugged, and you say is favourable?\u0027\n \u0027I meant you and Kyle both having shadows,\u0027 Quint explained. \u0027It evens things up. And maybe we can cancel out one with the other.\u0027\n Krakovitch was alarmed. \u0027I not being party to violence! Anything happen to that KGB dog, is possible I get the troubles.\u0027\n \u0027But if we could arrange for him to be, er, detained for a day or two? I mean, unharmed, you understand - completely unharmed - just detained. .\n \u0027I not know. .\n \u0027To give you time to clear our route into Romania. You know, visas, etcetera? With a bit of luck we\u0027ll be finished there in just a day or two.\u0027\n Krakovitch slowly nodded. \u0027Maybe - but positive guarantee, no dirty work. He is KGB - you say - but if true, then he\u0027s Russian too. And I am Russian. If he vanish . .\n Quint shook his head, grasped the other\u0027s thin elbow. \u0027They both vanish!\u0027 he said. \u0027But only for a few days. Then we\u0027ll be out of here and getting on with the job.\u0027\n Again Krakovitch gave his slow nod. \u0027Maybe - if it can be arranged safely.\u0027\n Kyle and Gulharov returned. Kyle was careful. \u0027That was somebody called Brown,\u0027 he said. \u0027He\u0027s been watching us, apparently.\u0027 He looked at Krakovitch. \u0027He says your KGB tail has traced us and is on his way here. By the way, this KGB fellow is well known - his name is Theo Dolgikh.\u0027\n Krakovitch shook his head, shrugged, looked mystified. \u0027I never heard of him.\u0027\n \u0027Did you get Brown\u0027s number?\u0027 Quint was eager. \u0027I mean can we contact him again?\u0027\n Kyle raised his eyebrows. \u0027Actually, yes,\u0027 he nodded. He said that if things were getting sticky, he might be able to help. Why do you ask?\u0027\n Quint grinned tightly, said to Krakovitch, \u0027Comrade, it might be a good idea if you were to listen carefully. Since you\u0027re a little concerned about this, you can start working on an alibi. For from this point forward you\u0027re hand in hand with the enemy. Your only consolation is that you\u0027ll be working against a greater enemy.\u0027 The grin left his face, and deadly serious he said, \u0027OK, here\u0027s what I suggest. .\n On Saturday morning at 8.30 Kyle phoned Krakovitch at his and Gulharov\u0027s hotel. The latter answered the call, grunted, fetched Krakovitch who came grumbling to the phone. He was just out of bed, could Kyle call later? While this brief show was going on, downstairs in the Genovese\u0027s lobby, Quint was talking to Brown. At 9.15 Kyle phoned Krakovitch again and arranged a second meeting: they would meet outside Frankie\u0027s Franchise in an hour\u0027s time and go on from there.\n There was nothing new in this arrangement; it was part of the plan worked out the night before: Kyle suspected that the phone in his room was now bugged and he simply wanted to give Theo Dolgikh plenty of advance notice. If Kyle\u0027s phone wasn\u0027t bugged, then Krakovitch\u0027s surely was, which could only work out the same. Anyway, the psychic sixth senses of both Kyle and Quint were playing up a little, which told them that something was brewing.\n Sure enough, when they left the Geriovese just before 10.00 A.M. and headed for the docks, they had a tail.\n Dolgikh was keeping well back, but it could only be him. Kyle and Quint had to admire his tenacity, for despite his rough night he was still very much the master-spy; now his attire was that of the shipyard worker, dark-blue coveralls and a heavy bag of tools, and the blue-black stubble of twenty-four hours\u0027 growth on his round, intense face.\n \u0027He must have a hell of a wardrobe, this lad,\u0027 said Kyle as he and Quint approached the narrow, still slumbering streets of Genoa\u0027s dockland. \u0027I\u0027d hate to have to carry his luggage!\u0027\n Quint shook his head. \u0027No,\u0027 he answered, \u0027I shouldn\u0027t think so. They\u0027ll probably have a safe house here and there\u0027s bound to be one of their ships in the harbour. Whichever, when he requires a change of clothing, they\u0027ll be the ones who\u0027ll fix it for him.\u0027\n Kyle squinted at him out of the corner of his eye. \u0027You know,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m sure you\u0027d have been better off in M15. You have a bent for it.\u0027\n \u0027It might make an interesting hobby.\u0027 Quint grinned. \u0027Mundane spying, that is - but I\u0027m happy where I am. The real talent\u0027s with INTESP. Now if our man Dolgikh were an esper, then we could be in real trouble.\u0027\n Kyle gave his companion a sharp glance, then relaxed. \u0027But he isn\u0027t or we\u0027d have spotted him without Brown\u0027s assistance. No, he\u0027s simply one of their surveillance types, and pretty good at his job. I\u0027ve been thinking of him as something big, but this is probably the biggest assignment he\u0027s ever had.\u0027\n \u0027Which,\u0027 Quint grimly added, \u0027with any luck, is just about to terminate a mite ingloriously. But I wouldn\u0027t be too sure he\u0027s small fry, if I were you. After all, he was big enough to show up on Brown\u0027s firm\u0027s computer.\u0027\n Carl Quint was right: Theo Dolgikh was not small fry, not in any sense of the word. Indeed, it was a measure of Yuri Andropov\u0027s \u0027respect\u0027 for the Soviet E-Branch that he\u0027d put Dolgikh on the job. For Leonid Brezhnev would likely give Andropov a hard time if Krakovitch were to report to him that the KGB were interfering again.\n Dolgikh was in his early thirties, a native Siberian bred of a long line of Komsomol lumberjacks. He was the complete communist for whom little else existed but Party and State. He had trained, and later done some teaching, in Berlin, Bulgaria, Palestine and Libya. He was an expert in weapons (especially Western Bloc weapons), also in terrorism, sabotage, interrogation and surveillance; as well as Russian, he could speak a broken Italian, decent German and English. But his real forte - indeed his penchant - lay in the field of murder. For Theo Dolgikh was a cold-blooded killer.\n Because of his compressed build, Dolgikh might seem at a distance short and stubby. In fact he was five-ten and weighed in at almost sixteen stone. Heavy-boned, heavjowled under a moon face that supported a mop of uneven jet-black hair, Dolgikh was \u0027heavy\u0027 in all departments. His Japanese instructor at the KGB School of Martial Arts in Moscow used to say:\n \u0027Comrade, you are too heavy for this game. Because of your bulk, you lack speed and agility. Sumo wrestling would be more your style. On the other hand, very little of your weight is fat, and muscle is most useful. Since teaching you the disciplines of self-defence is probably a great waste of time, I shall therefore concentrate my instruction on ways of killing, for which I am assured you are not only physically but mentally best suited.\u0027\n Now, closing in on his quarry as they entered the winding, labyrinthine streets and alleys close to the docks, Dolgikh felt his blood rising and wished this were that sort of job. After last night\u0027s run-around he could happily murder this pair! And it would be so easy. They seemed utterly obsessed with this most seamy side of the city.\n Thirty yards ahead of him, Kyle and Quint made a sudden sharp turn into a cobbled alley where the buildings loomed high, shutting out the light. Dolgikh put on a little speed, arrived at the alley\u0027s entrance, passed from grey drizzle into a steamy gloom where the refuse of four or five days stood uncollected. In many places overhead the opposing buildings were arched over. Following a frantic Friday night, this district wasn\u0027t even awake yet. If Dolgikh had been after the lives of these two, this would have been the place to do it.\n Footsteps echoed back to him. The Russian agent narrowed small round eyes to gaze through the gloom of the alley at a pair of shadowy figures as they rounded a bend. He paused for a second, then started after them. But, sensing movement close by, a silent presence, he at once skidded to a halt.\n From the shadows of a recessed doorway a gravelly voice said, \u0027Hello, Theo. You don\u0027t know me, but I know you!\u0027\n Dolgikh\u0027s Japanese instructor had been right: he wasn\u0027t fast enough. At times like this his bulk got in the way. Gritting his teeth in anticipation of the dull smack of the suspected cosh and its pain, or maybe the blue glint of a silencer on the end of a gun barrel, he whirled towards the voice in the darkness, hurled his heavy bag of tools. A tall, shadowy figure caught the bag full in the chest, grunted, and lobbed it aside to clatter on the cobbles. Dolgikh\u0027s eyes were getting used to the gloom. It was still dark, but he\u0027d seen no sign of a weapon. This was just the way he liked it.\n Head down, like a human torpedo, he hurled himself into the doorway\u0027s shadows.\n \u0027Mr Brown\u0027 hit him twice, two expertly delivered blows, not calculated to kill but simply stun. And to be doubly sure, before Dolgikh could fall, Brown slammed the Russian\u0027s head into the stout panels of the door, splintering one of them.\n A moment later he stepped out of the shadows into the alley, glanced this way and that, satisfied himself that all was well. Just the drip of rain and the stinking vapours from the garbage. And now there was this extra heap of garbage. Brown grinned hugely, toed Dolgikh\u0027s crumpled figure.\n That was always the way of it with big men: they tended to assume that they were the biggest, the toughest. But that wasn\u0027t always the case. Brown was about the same weight as Dolgikh, but he was three inches taller and five years younger. Ex-SAS, his training had been none too gentle. In fact, if he hadn\u0027t developed something of a kink in his mental make-up, he\u0027d probably still be with the\n SAS.\n He grinned again, then hunched his shoulders and shrank down into his raincoat.
