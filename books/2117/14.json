{"id":92845,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Inside the house, Layard and Jordan had carefully, systematically searched the ground floor and now approached the main staircase to the upper levels. They\u0027d switched on dim lights as they went, compensating a little for the gloom. At the foot of the stairs they paused.\n \u0027Where the hell is Roberts?\u0027 Layard whispered. \u0027We could use some instructions.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027 Jordan glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. \u0027We know what we\u0027re up against mainly. And we know what to do.\u0027\n \u0027But there should be four of us in here.\u0027\n Jordan gritted his teeth. \u0027There was something of a row out front. Trouble, obviously. Anyway, by now someone should be planting charges in the cellars. So let\u0027s not waste time. We can ask questions later.\u0027\n On a narrow landing where the stairs turned through a right angle, a large, built-in cupboard faced them squarely, its door a little ajar. Jordan kept his crossbow lined up on the large-panelled door, sidled past and continued up the stairs. He wasn\u0027t passing the buck; it was simply that if there was anything nasty in there, he knew Layard could stop it with a single burst of liquid fire.\n Layard checked that the valve on his hose was open, rested his finger on the trigger, toed the door open. In there... darkness.\n He waited until his eyes were growing accustomed to the dimness, then spotted a light switch on the wall just inside the door. He reached out his hand, then drew it back. He stepped forward a pace, used the nozzle of his hose to trip the switch. A light came on, throwing the interior of the cupboard into sharp relief. At the back a tall figure! Layard drew breath sharply; his jaw fell partly open and the corners of his mouth drew back in a half-rictus of fear. He was a breath from squeezing the trigger but then his eyes focussed and he saw only an old raincoat, hanging on a peg.\n Layard gulped, filled his lungs, quietly closed the door. Jordan was up on the first floor landing. He saw two alcoves, arched over, with closed doors set centrally. There was also a passage, with two more doors that he could see before the corridor turned a corner. The closest door was maybe eight paces away, the furthest twelve. He turned back to the doors in the alcoves, approached the first of them, turned the doorknob and kicked it open: it was a toilet with a high window, letting in grey light.\n Jordan turned to the second door, dealt with it as with the first. Inside was an extensive library, the whole room visible at a glance. Then, aware that Layard was coming up the stairs, he started down the corridor and at once paused. His ears pricked up. He heard... water? The hiss and gurgle of a tap?\n A shower! The water sounds were coming from the second room - a bathroom? down the corridor. Jordan looked back. Layard was at the top of the stairs. Their eyes met. Jordan pointed to the first door, then at Layard. Layard was to deal with it. Then Jordan thumbed his own chest, pointed along the corridor to the second door.\n He went on, but cautiously, crossbow held chest high and pointed dead ahead. The water sounds were louder, and a voice? A girl\u0027s voice singing? Humming, anyway. Some utterly tuneless melody . .\n In this house at this time, a girl humming to herself in a shower? Or was it a trap? -\n Jordan took a tighter grip on his crossbow, turned the knob and kicked in the door. No trap! Not that he could see. In fact the completely natural scene beyond the bathroom door left him at a complete loss. All of the tension went out of him in a moment, and he was left feeling... like some gross intruder!\n The girl (Helen Lake, surely?) was beautiful, and quite naked. Water streamed down on her, setting her lovely body gleaming. She stood sideways on, picked out in clear definition against blue ceramic tiles, in the shower\u0027s shallow well. As the door slammed open she jerked her head round to stare at Jordan, her eyes opening wide in terror. Then she gasped, crumpled back against the shower\u0027s wall, looking as if she were about to faint. One hand flew to her breasts and her eyelids fluttered as her knees began to give way.\n Jordan half-lowered his crossbow, said to himself: Sweet Jesus! But this is just a frightened girl! He began to reach out his free hand - to steady her - but then other thoughts, her thoughts, abruptly printed themselves on his telepathic mind.\n Come on, my sweet! Come help me! Ah, just touch me, hold me! Just a little closer, my sweet... there! And now - Jordan jerked back as she turned more fully towards him. Her eyes were wide, triangular, demonic! Her face had been instantly transformed into that of a beast! And in her right hand, invisible until now, was a carving knife. The knife rose as she reached out and grasped Jordan\u0027s jacket. Her grip was iron! She drew him effortlessly towards her - and he fired his bolt into her breast point-blank.\n Slammed back against the rear wall of the shower, pinned there by the bolt, she dropped her knife and began to issue peal after ringing peal of soul-searing screams. Blood gushed from where the bolt was bedded in her with little more than its flight protruding. She grasped it, and still screaming jerked her body this way and that. The bolt came loose from the wall in a crunching of tiles and plaster and she staggered to and fro in the shower, yanking on the bolt and screaming endlessly.\n \u0027God, God, oh God!\u0027 Jordan cried, riveted to the spot.\n Layard shouldered him aside, squeezed the trigger on his flame-thrower, turned the entire shower unit into a blistering, steaming pressure-cooker. After several seconds he stopped hosing, and stared with Jordan at the result. Black smoke and steam cleared and the water continued to hiss, spurting from half-a-dozen places now in the molten plastic tubing of the shower\u0027s system. In the shallow well, Helen Lake\u0027s body slumped, features bubbling, hair like smouldering stubble, every inch of her skin peeling from her in great raw strips.\n \u0027God help us!\u0027 Jordan gasped, turned away to be sick.\n \u0027God?\u0027 the thing in the shower croaked, like a voice from the abyss. \u0027What god? You bloody black bastards!\u0027\n Impossibly she came erect, took a blind, stumbling, groping step forward.\n Layard torched her again, but more out of mercy than from fear. He let his flame-thrower roar until fire belched out of the shower and threatened to burn him, too. Then he switched off, backed away down the corridor to where Jordan stood retching over the stair\u0027s balustrade.\n From below, Roberts\u0027s voice reached anxiously up to them: \u0027Ken? Trevor? What is it?\u0027\n Layard wiped his forehead. \u0027We... we got the girl,\u0027 he whispered, then shouted, \u0027We got the girl!\u0027\n \u0027We got her mother,\u0027 Roberts answered, \u0027and Bodescu\u0027s dog. That leaves Bodescu himself, and his mother.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s a door up here, locked,\u0027 Layard called back. \u0027I thought I heard someone in there.\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t you break it in?\u0027\n \u0027No, it\u0027s oak, old and heavy. I could burn it. .\n \u0027No time for that. And if there is anyone in there, they\u0027re finished anyway. The cellars are mined by now.\n You\u0027d better come down - and quickly! We have to get out of here.\u0027\n Layard dragged Jordan after him down the stairs, calling ahead, \u0027Guy, where the hell have you been?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m on my own,\u0027 Roberts responded. \u0027Trask\u0027s out of it for now - but he\u0027s OK. Where\u0027ve I been? I\u0027ve been checking this place through downstairs.\u0027\n \u0027A waste of time,\u0027 Jordan groaned, half to himself.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Roberts raised his voice more yet.\n \u0027I said, we\u0027d already done it!\u0027 Jordan yelled, but needlessly for they were down the stairs, with Roberts propelling them towards the entrance hall and the open door...\n Simon Gower and Harvey Newton had gone down into the cellars via the outbuilding with its narrow steps and central ramp. Loaded down with almost two hundred pounds of explosives between them, they had found the lights out of order, and so been obliged to use pocket torches. The vaults under the house were black and silent as a tomb, seemed extensive as a catacomb. They stuck close together, dumping thermite and plastic explosive packages wherever they found support walls or buttressed archways, and even though they went with something of caution, still they managed rapidly to fairly well saturate the place with their load. Newton carried a small can of petrol with which he left a trail from one dump to the next, until the whole place reeked of highly volatile fuel.\n Finally they were satisfied that they\u0027d explored and mined every part - and likewise pleased that they\u0027d come across nothing dangerous - and so turned back and retraced their tracks to the exit. At a place they both agreed to be approximately central under the house, they set down the last of their load. Then Newton splashed what was left of his petrol all the way to the foot of the out building steps, while Gower double-checked the charges they\u0027d planted, making sure they were all amply primed. - At the steps Newton tossed down his empty can, turned\n and looked back into the gloom. From a little way back, round a corner, he could hear Gower\u0027s hoarse breathing and he knew that the other man worked furiously at his task. Gower\u0027s torch made flickering patches of light back there, its beam swinging this way and that as he worked.\n Roberts appeared at the top of the steps, called down, \u0027Newton, Gower? You can come up out of there as quick as you like. We\u0027re all set if you are. The others are spread out round the house, just waiting. The mist has cleared. So if anything tries to break loose, we\u0027ll - \u0027\n \u0027Harvey?\u0027 Gower\u0027s tremulous voice came out of the darkness, several notes higher up the scale than it should be. \u0027Harvey, was that you just then?\u0027\n Newton called back, \u0027No, it\u0027s Roberts. Hurry up, will you?\u0027\n \u0027No, not Roberts,\u0027 Gower was breathless, almost whispering. \u0027Something else . .\n Roberts and Newton looked at each other round-eyed. The ground gave itself a shake, a very definite tremor. From inside the cellars, Gower screamed.\n Roberts came half-way down the steps, stumbling and yelling: \u0027Simon, get out of there! Hurry, man!\u0027\n Gower screamed again, the cry of a trapped animal. \u0027It\u0027s here, Guy! Oh, God - it\u0027s here! Under the ground!\u0027\n Newton made to go in after him but Roberts reached down and grabbed his collar. The ground was shaking now, dust billowing out of the yawning mouth of the old cellars. There were rending sounds, and other noises which might or might not be Gower choking his life out. Bricks started to slide loose from rotten mortar in the retaining walls, spilling down the sides of the ramp.\n Newton started to back up the trembling steps, with Roberts dragging him from above. When they were almost at the top, they saw a cloud of dust and debris suddenly expelled forcefully from the entrance to the cellar - and then the door itself was lifted off its rusty hinges and hurled down at the foot of the ramp, a mass of splintered boards.\n Something was framed in the dusty gap of the entrance. It was Gower, and it was more than Gower. He hung for a moment suspended in the otherwise empty doorway, swaying left and right. Then he emerged more fully and the watchers saw the huge, leprous trunk which propelled him. The thing - indeed \u0027the Other\u0027 - had entered his back in a solid shaft of matter, but inside Gower its massive pseudopod of vampire flesh had branched, following his pipes and conduits to several exits. Tentacles writhed from his gaping mouth and nostrils, the sockets of his dislocated eyes, his ruptured ears. And even as Roberts and Newton clambered in a frenzy of terror up the last few steps from the ramp, so Gower\u0027s entire front burst open, revealing a lashing nest of crimson, groping worms!\n \u0027Jesus!\u0027 Guy Roberts shouted then, his voice a sand-papered howl of horror and hatred. \u0027Sweet J-e-s-u-s!\u0027\n He aimed his hose down the ramp. \u0027Goodbye, Simon. God grant you peace!\u0027\n Liquid fire roared its rage, ran like a flood down the ramp, hurled itself in a fireball at the suspended man and the beast-thing holding him upright. The great pseudopod was instantly retracted - Gower with it, snatched back like a rag doll - and Roberts aimed his hose directly at the doorway at the foot of the steps. He turned the valve up full, and a shimmering jet of heat blasted its way into the cellar, fanning out inside the labyrinth of vaults into every niche and corner. For a count of five Roberts held it. Then came the first explosion.\n Down went the entrance in a massive shuddering of earth. A shockwave of lashing heat hurled dirt and pebbles up the ramp, knocking Roberts and Newton off their feet. Roberts\u0027s finger automatically came off the trigger. His weapon smoked hot but silent in his hands. And crump! crump! crump! came evenly spaced, muffled concussions from deep in the earth, each one shaking the ground with pile-driver power.\n Faster came the underground explosions, occurring in sporadic bursts, occasionally twinned, as the planted charges reacted to the heat and added to the unseen inferno. Newton got up and helped Roberts to his feet. They stumbled clear of the house, took up positions with Layard and Jordan, a man to each of the four corners but standing well back. The old barn, still blazing, began to vibrate as if itself alive and suffering its death agonies. Finally it shook itself to pieces and slid down into the suddenly seething earth. For a moment a lashing tentacle reached up from the shuddering foundations to a height of some twenty feet, then collapsed and was sucked back down into the quaking, liquefying quag of earth and fire.\n Ken Layard was closest to that area. He ran raggedly away from the house, put distance between himself and the barn, too, before stumbling to a halt and staring with wide eyes and gaping mouth at the upstairs windows of the main building. Then he beckoned to Roberts to come and join him.\n \u0027Look!\u0027 Layard yelled, over the sound of subterranean thunder and the hiss and crackle of fire. They both stared at the house. Framed in a second-floor window, the figure of a mature woman stood with her arms held high, almost in an attitude of supplication. \u0027Bodescu\u0027s mother,\u0027 Roberts said. \u0027It can only be her: Georgina Bodescu - God help her!\u0027\n A corner of the house collapsed, sank into the earth in ruins. Where it went down, a geyser of fire spouted high as the roof, hurling broken bricks and mortar with it.\n There were more explosions and the entire house shuddered. It was visibly settling on its foundations, cracks spreading across its walls, chimneys tottering. The four watchers backed off further yet, Layard dragging Ben Trask with him. Then Layard noticed the truck where it stood on the drive, jolting about on its own suspension.\n He went to get it, but Guy Roberts stayed where he was, stood over Trask and continued to watch the figure of the woman at the window.\n She hadn\u0027t changed her position. She stumbled a little now and then as the house settled, but always regained her pose, arms raised on high and head thrown back, so that it seemed to Roberts that indeed she talked to God. Telling Him what? Asking for what? Forgiveness for her son? A merciful release for herself?\n Newton and Jordan left their positions at the rear of the house and came round to the front. It was clear that nothing was going to escape from that inferno now. They helped Layard get Trask into the truck; and while they busied themselves with preparations for their leaving, still Roberts watched the house burn, and so was witness to the end of it.\n The thermite had done its job and the earth itself was on fire. The house no longer had foundations on which to stand. It slumped down, leaned first one way and then the other. Old brickwork groaned as timbers sheared, chimney stacks toppled and windows shivered into fragments in their twisting frames. And as the house sank in leaping flames and molten earth, so its substance became fuel for the fire.\n Fire raced up walls inside and out; great red and yellow gouts of flame spurted from broken windows, bursting upward through a rent and sagging roof. For a single instant longer Georgina Bodescu was silhouetted against a background of crimson, searing heat, and then Harkley House gave up the ghost. It went down groaning into a scar of bubbling earth that resembled nothing so much as the mouth of a small volcano. For a little while longer the peaked gable ends and parts of the roof were visible, and then they too were consumed in vengeful fire and smoke.\n Through all of this the reek had been terrible. Judging by the stench, it might well have been that fifty men had died and been burned in that house; but as Roberts climbed up into the passenger seat of the truck and Layard headed the vehicle down the drive towards the gates, all five survivors, including Trask who was now mainly conscious, knew that the stench came from nothing human. It was partly thermite, partly earth and timber and old brick, but mainly it was the death smell of that rendered down, gigantic monstrosity under the cellars, that \u0027Other\u0027 which had taken poor Gower.\n The mist had almost completely cleared now, and cars were beginning to pull up along the verges of the road, their drivers attracted by the flames and smoke rising high into the air where Harkley House had stood. As the truck rolled out of the gates onto the road, a red-faced driver leaned out of his car\u0027s window, yelled, \u0027What is it? That\u0027s Harkley House, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027It was,\u0027 Roberts yelled back, offering what he hoped looked like a helpless shrug. \u0027Gone, I\u0027m afraid. Burned down.\u0027\n \u0027Good Lord!\u0027 The red-faced man was aghast. \u0027Has the fire service been informed?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re off to do that now,\u0027 Roberts answered. \u0027Little good that\u0027ll do, though. We\u0027ve been in to have a look, but there\u0027s nothing left to see, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027 They drove on.\n A mile towards Paignton, a clattering fire engine came tearing from the other direction. Layard drew dutifully in towards the side of the road to give the fire engine room. He grinned tiredly, without humour. \u0027Too late, my lads,\u0027 he commented under his breath. \u0027Much too late - thank all that\u0027s merciful.\u0027\n They dropped Trask off at the hospital in Torquay (with a story about an accident he\u0027d suffered in a friends garden) and after seeing him comfortable went back to the hotel HQ in Paignton to debrief.\n Roberts enumerated their successes. \u0027We got all three women, anyway. But as for Bodescu himself, I have my doubts about him. Serious doubts, and when we\u0027re finished here I\u0027ll pass them on to London, also to Darcy Clarke and our people up in Hartlepool. These will be simply precautionary measures, of course, for even if we did miss Bodescu we\u0027ve no way of knowing what he\u0027ll do next or where he\u0027ll go. Anyway, Alec Kyle will be back in control shortly. In fact it\u0027s queer he hasn\u0027t shown up yet. Actually, I\u0027m not looking forward to seeing him: he\u0027s going to be furious when he learns that Bodescu probably got out of that lot.\u0027\n \u0027Bodescu and that other dog,\u0027 Harvey Newton put in, almost as an afterthought. He shrugged. \u0027Still, I reckon it was just a stray that got into... the grounds . somehow?\u0027 He stopped, looked from face to face. All were staring back at him in astonishment, almost disbelief. It was the first they\u0027d heard of it.\n Roberts couldn\u0027t restrain himself from grabbing Newton\u0027s jacket front. \u0027Tell it now!\u0027 he grated through clenched teeth. \u0027Exactly as it happened, Harvey.\u0027 Newton, dazed, told it, concluding:\n \u0027So while Gower was burning that... that bloody thing which wasn\u0027t a dog not all of it, anyway - this other dog went by in the mist. But I can\u0027t even swear that I saw it at all! I mean, there was so much going on. It could have been just the mist, or my imagination, or... anything! I thought it loped, but sort of upright in an impossible forward crouch. And its head wasn\u0027t just the right shape. It had to be my imagination, a curl of mist, something like that. Imagination, yes - especially with Gower standing there burning that godawful dog! Christ, I\u0027ll dream of dogs like that for the rest of my life!\u0027\n Roberts released him violently, almost tossed him across the room. The fat man wasn\u0027t just fat; he was\n heavy, too, and very strong. He looked at Newton in disgust. \u0027Idiot!\u0027 he rumbled. He lit a cigarette, despite the fact that he already had one going.\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t have done anything anyway!\u0027 Newton protested. \u0027I\u0027d shot my bolt, hadn\u0027t reloaded yet . .\n \u0027Shot your bloody bolt?\u0027 Roberts glared. Then he calmed himself. \u0027I\u0027d like to say it\u0027s not your fault,\u0027 he told Newton then. \u0027And maybe it isn\u0027t your fault. Maybe he was just too damned clever for us.\u0027\n \u0027What now?\u0027 said Layard. He felt a little sorry for Newton, tried to take attention away from him.\n Roberts looked at Layard. \u0027Now? Well, when I\u0027ve calmed down a little you and me will have to try and find the bastard, that\u0027s what now!\u0027\n \u0027Find him?\u0027 Newton licked dry lips. How?\u0027 He was confused, wasn\u0027t thinking clearly.\n Roberts at once tapped the side of his head with huge white knuckles. \u0027With this!\u0027 he shouted. \u0027It\u0027s what I do. I\u0027m a \"scryer\", remember?\u0027 He glared again at Newton. \u0027So what\u0027s your fucking talent? Other than screwing things up, I mean. .\n Newton found a chair and fell into it. \u0027I... I saw him, and yet convinced myself that I hadn\u0027t seen him. What the hell\u0027s wrong with me? We went there to trap him - to trap anything coming out of that house - so why didn\u0027t I react more posit - ,\n Jordan drew air sharply and made a conclusive, snapping sound with his fingers. He gave a sharp nod, said, \u0027Of course!\u0027\n They all looked at him.\n \u0027Of course!\u0027 he said again, spitting the words out. \u0027He\u0027s talented too, remember? Too bloody talented by a mile!\n Harvey, he got to you. Telepathically, I mean. Hell, he got to me too! Convinced us he wasn\u0027t there, that we couldn\u0027t see him. And I really didn\u0027t see him, not a hair of him. I was there, too, remember, when Simon was burning that thing. But I saw nothing. So don\u0027t feel too bad about it, Harvey - at least you actually saw the bastard!\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 Roberts nodded after a moment. \u0027You have to be. So now we know for sure: Bodescu is loose, angry and - God, dangerous! Yes, and he\u0027s more powerful, far more powerful, than anyone has yet given him credit for . .\n Wednesday, 12.30 A.M. middle-European time, the border crossing-point near Siret in Moldavia.\n Krakovitch and Gulharov had shared the driving between them, though Carl Quint would have been only too happy to drive if they had let him. At least that might have relieved some of his boredom. Quint hadn\u0027t found the Romanian countryside along their route - railway depots standing forlorn and desolate as scarecrows, dingy industrial sites, fouled rivers and the like - especially romantic. But even without him, and despite the often dilapidated condition of the roads, still the Russians had made fairly good time. Or at least they\u0027d made good time until they arrived here; but \u0027here\u0027 was the middle of nowhere, and for some as yet unexplained reason they\u0027d been held up \u0027here\u0027 for the last four hours.\n Earlier their route out of Bucharest had taken them through Buzau, Focsani and Bacau along the banks of the Siretul, and so into Moldavia. In Roman they\u0027d crossed the river, then continued up through Botosani where they\u0027d paused to eat, and so into and through Siret. Now, on the northern extreme of the town, the border crossing-point blocked their way, with Chernovtsy and the Prut some twenty miles to the north. By now Krakovitch had planned on being through Chernovtsy and into Kolomyya under the old mountains the old Carpathians for the night, but.\n \u0027But!\u0027 he raged now in the paraffin lamplight glare of the border post. \u0027But, but, but!\u0027 He slammed his fist down on the counter-top which kept staff a little apart from travellers; he spoke, or shouted, in Russian so explosive that Quint and Gulharov winced and gritted their teeth where they sat in the car outside the wooden chalet-styled building. The border post sat centrally between the incoming and outgoing lanes, with barrier arms extending on both sides. Uniformed guards manned sentry boxes, a Romanian for incoming traffic, a Russian for outgoing. The senior officer was, of course, Russian. And right now he was under pressure from Felix Krakovitch.\n \u0027Four hours!\u0027 Krakovitch raved. \u0027Four bloody hours sitting here at the end of the world, waiting for you to make up your mind! I\u0027ve told you who I am and proved it. Are my documents in order?\u0027\n The round-faced, overweight Russian official shrugged helplessly. \u0027Of course, comrade, but - \u0027\n \u0027No, no, no!\u0027 Krakovitch shouted. \u0027No more buts, just yes or no. And Comrade Gulharov\u0027s documents, are they in order?\u0027\n The Russian customs man bobbed uncomfortably this way and that, shrugged again. \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Krakovitch leaned over the counter, shoved his face close to that of the other. \u0027And do you believe that I have the ear of the Party Leader himself? Are you sure that you\u0027re aware that if your bloody telephone was working, by now I\u0027d be speaking to Brezhnev himself in Moscow, -and that next week you\u0027d be manning a crossing-point into Manchuria?\u0027\n \u0027If you say so, Comrade Krakovitch,\u0027 the other sighed. He struggled for words, a way to begin a sentence with something other than \u0027but\u0027. \u0027Alas, I am also aware that the other gentleman in your car is not a Soviet citizen,\n and that his documents are not in order! If I were to let you through without the proper authorisation, next week I could well be a lumberjack in Omsk! I don\u0027t have the build for it, Comrade.\u0027\n \u0027What sort of a bloody control point is this, anyway?\u0027 Krakovitch was in full flood. \u0027No telephone, no electric light? I suppose we must thank God you have toilets! Now listen to me - \u0027\n \u0027 - I have listened, Comrade,\u0027 at least the officer\u0027s guts weren\u0027t all sagging inside his belly, \u0027to threats and vitriolic raving, for at least three-and-a-half hours, but - \u0027\n \u0027BUT?\u0027 Krakovitch couldn\u0027t believe it; this couldn\u0027t be happening to him. He shook his fist at the other. \u0027Idiot! I\u0027ve counted eleven cars and twenty-seven lorries through here towards Kolomyya since our arrival. Your man out there didn\u0027t even check the papers of half of them!\u0027\n \u0027Because we know them. They travel through here regularly. Many of them live in or close to Kolomyya. I have explained this a hundred times.\n \u0027Think on this!\u0027 Krakovitch snapped. \u0027Tomorrow you could be explaining it to the KGB!\u0027\n \u0027More threats.\u0027 The other gave another shrug. \u0027One stops worrying.\u0027\n \u0027Total inefficiency!\u0027 Krakovitch snarled. \u0027Three hours ago you said that the telephones would be working in a few minutes. Likewise two hours ago, and one hour ago - and the time now is fast approaching one in the morning!\u0027\n \u0027I know the time, Comrade. There is a fault in the electricity supply. It is being dealt with. What more can I say?\u0027 He sat down on a padded chair behind the counter.\n Krakovitch almost leaped over the counter to get at him. \u0027Don\u0027t you dare sit down! Not while I am on my feet!\u0027\n The other wiped his forehead, stood up again, prepared himself for another tirade . .\n Outside in the car, Sergei Gulharov had restlessly turned this way and that, peering first out of one window, then another. Carl Quint sensed problems, trouble, danger ahead. In fact he\u0027d been on edge since seeing Kyle off at the airport in Bucharest. But worrying about it would get him nowhere, and anyway he felt too banged-about to pursue it. If anything, not being allowed to drive being obliged to simply sit there, with the drab countryside slipping endlessly by outside - had made him more weary yet. Now he felt that he could sleep for a week, and it might as well be here as anywhere.\n Gulharov\u0027s attention had now fastened on something outside the car. He grew still, thoughtful. Quint looked at him: \"silent Sergei\u0027, as he and Kyle had privately named him. It wasn\u0027t his fault he spoke no English; in fact he did speak it, but very little, and with many errors. Now he answered Quint\u0027s glance, nodded his short-cropped head, and pointed through the open window of the car at something. \u0027Look,\u0027 he softly said. Quint looked.\n Silhouetted against a low, distant haze of blue light - the lights of Kolomyya, Quint supposed - black cables snaked between poles over the border check point, with one section of cable descending into the building itself. The power supply. Now Gulharov turned and pointed off to the west, where the cable ran back in the direction of Suet. A hundred yards away, the loop of cable between two of the poles dipped right down under the night horizon. It had been grounded.\n \u0027Excusing,\u0027 said Gulharov. He eased himself out of the car, walked back along the central reservation, and disappeared into darkness. Quint considered going after him, but decided against it. He felt very vulnerable, and outside the car would feel even more so. At least the car\u0027s interior was familiar to him. He tuned himself again to Krakovitch\u0027s raving, coming loud and clear through the night from the border post. Quint couldn\u0027t understand what was being said, but someone was getting a hard time . .\n \u0027An end to all foolishness!\u0027 Krakovitch shouted. \u0027Now I will tell you what I am going to do. I shall drive back into Siret to the police station and phone Moscow from there.\u0027\n \u0027Good,\u0027 said the fat official. \u0027And providing that Moscow can send the correct documentation for the Englishman, down the telephone wire, then I shall let you through!\u0027\n \u0027Dolt!\u0027 Krakovitch sneered. \u0027You, of course, shall come with me to Siret, where you\u0027ll receive your instructions direct from the Kremlin!\u0027\n How dearly the other would have loved to tell him that he had already received his instructions from Moscow, but... he\u0027d been warned against that. Instead he slowly shook his head. \u0027Unfortunately, Comrade, I cannot leave my post. Dereliction of duty is a very serious matter. Nothing you or anyone else could say could force me from my place of duty.\u0027\n Krakovitch saw from the official\u0027s red face that he\u0027d pushed him too far. Now he would probably be more stubborn than ever, even to the point of deliberate obstruction.\n That was a thought which made Krakovitch frown. For what if all of this trouble had been \u0027deliberate obstruction\u0027 right from the start? Was that possible? \u0027Then the solution is simple,\u0027 he said. \u0027I assume that Siret does have a twenty-four hour police station - with telephones that work?\u0027\n His opponent chewed his lip. \u0027Of course,\u0027 he finally answered.\n \u0027Then I shall simply telephone ahead to Kolomyya and have a unit of the nearest military force here within the hour. How will it feel, Comrade, to be a Russian, commanded by some Russian army officer to stand aside, while I and my friends are escorted through your stupid little checkpoint? And to know that tomorrow all hell is\n going to descend on you, because you will have been the focus of what could well be a serious international incident?\u0027\n At which precise moment, out in the field to the west of the road and back a little way towards Siret, Sergei Gulharov stooped and picked up the two uncoupled halves, male and female, of a heavy electrical connection. Taped to the main supply cable was a much thinner telephone wire. Its connection, also broken, was a simple, slender plug-and-socket affair. He connected the telephone cable first, then without pause screwed the heavier couplings together. There came a sputter and crackle of current, a flash of blue sparks, and - The lights came on in the border post. Krakovitch, on the point of leaving to carry out his threat, stopped at the door, turned back and saw the look of confusion on the official\u0027s face. \u0027I suppose,\u0027 Krakovitch said, \u0027this means your telephone is also working again?\u0027\n \u0027I... I suppose so,\u0027 said the other.\n Krakovitch came back to the counter. \u0027Which means,\u0027 his tone was icy, \u0027that from now on we might just start to get somewhere . .\n 1.00A.M. in Moscow.\n At the Ch\u0026acirc;teau Bronnitsy, some miles out of the city along the Serpukhov Road, Ivan Gerenko and Theo Dolgikh stood at an oval observation port of one-way glass and stared into the room beyond at a scene like something out of a science fiction nightmare.\n Inside the \u0027operating theatre\u0027, Alec Kyle lay unconscious on his back, strapped to a padded table. His head was slightly elevated by means of a rubber cushion, and a bulky stainless-steel helmet covered his head and eyes in a half dome, leaving his nose and mouth free for breathing. Hundreds of hair-fine wires cased in coloured plastic sleeves shimmered like a rainbow from the helmet to a computer where three operators worked frantically, following thought sequences from beginning to end and erasing them at the point of resolution. Inside the helmet, many tiny sensor electrodes had been clamped to Kyle\u0027s skull; others, along with batteries of micro-monitors, were secured by tape to his chest, wrists, stomach and throat. Four more men, telepaths, sat paired on each side of Kyle on stainless-steel chairs, scribbling in notebooks in their laps, each with one hand resting lightly on Kyle\u0027s naked body. A master telepathist - Zek Foener, E-Branch\u0027s best\n - sat alone in one corner of the room. Foener was a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties, an East German recruited by Gregor Borowitz during his last days as head of the branch. She sat with her elbows on her knees, one hand to her brow, utterly motionless, totally intent upon absorbing Kyle\u0027s thoughts as quickly as they were stimulated and generated.\n Dolgikh was full of morbid fascination. He had arrived with Kyle at the ch\u0026acirc;teau about 11.00 A.M. Their flight from Bucharest had been made in a military transport aircraft to an airbase in Smolensk, then to the Ch\u0026acirc;teau in E-Branch\u0027s own helicopter. All of this had been achieved in absolute secrecy; KGB cover had been tight as a drum. Not even Brezhnev - especially Brezhnev - knew what was happening here.\n At the Ch\u0026acirc;teau Kyle had been injected with a truth serum - not to loosen his tongue but his mind - which had rendered him unconscious. And for the last twelve hours, with booster shots of the serum at regular intervals, he had been giving up all the secrets of INTESP to the Soviet espers. Theo Dolgikh, however, was a very mundane man. His ideas of interrogation, or \u0027truth gathering\u0027, were far removed from anything he saw here.\n \u0027What exactly are they doing to him? How does this work, Comrade?\u0027 he asked.\n Without looking at Dolgikh, with his faded hazel eyes following every slightest movement in the room beyond\n the screen, Gerenko answered, \u0027You, of all people, have surely heard of brainwashing, Theo? Well, that is what we are doing: washing Alec Kyle\u0027s brain. So thoroughly, in fact, that it will come out of the wash bleached!\u0027\n Ivan Gerenko was slight, and so small as to be almost childlike in stature; but his wrinkled skin, faded eyes and generally sallow appearance were those of an old man. And yet he was only thirty-seven. A rare disease had stunted him physically, aged him prematurely, and a contrary Nature had made up the deficiency by giving him a supplementary \u0027talent\u0027. He was a \u0027deflector\u0027.\n Like Darcy Clarke in many ways, he was the opposite of accident-prone. But where Clarke\u0027s talent avoided danger, Gerenko actually deflected it. A well-aimed blow would not strike him; the shaft of an axe would break before the blade could touch his flesh. The advantage was enormous, immeasurable: he feared nothing and was almost scornful of physical danger. And it accounted for his totally disdainful manner where people such as Theo Dolgikh were concerned. Why should he afford them any sort of respect? They might dislike him, but they could never hurt him. No man was capable of bringing physical harm to Ivan Gerenko.\n \u0027Brainwashing?\u0027 Dolgikh repeated him. \u0027I had thought some sort of interrogation, surely?\u0027\n \u0027Both,\u0027 Gerenko nodded, talking rather to himself than by way of answering Dolgikh. \u0027We use science, psychology, parapsychology. The three Ts: technology, terror, telepathy. The drug we\u0027ve put in his blood stimulates memory. It works by making him feel alone - utterly alone. He feels that no one else exists in all the universe\n - even his own existence is in doubt! He wants to \u0027talk\u0027 about all of his experiences, everything he ever did or saw or said, because that way he will know that he is real, that he has existence. But if he physically tried to do it at the speed his mind is working, he would rapidly dehydrate\n and burn himself out; especially if he were awake, conscious. Also, we are not interested in the accumulation of all of that information, we do not wish to know \u0027everything\u0027. His life in general holds little of interest to us, but of course we are completely fascinated with details of his work for INTESP.\u0027\n Dolgikh shook his head in bewilderment. \u0027You are stealing his thoughts?\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes! It\u0027s an idea we borrowed from Boris Dragosani. He was a necromancer: he could steal the thoughts of the dead! We can only do it to the living, but when we\u0027re finished they\u0027re as good as dead...\u0027\n \u0027But... I mean, how?\u0027 The concept was over Dolgikh\u0027s head.\n Gerenko glanced at him, just a glance, a twitch of the eyes in his wizened head. \u0027I can\u0027t explain \"how\" - not to you - only \"what\". When he touches upon a mundane matter, the entire subject is drawn from him swiftly - and erased. This saves time, for he can\u0027t return to that subject again. But when we are interested in his subject, then the telepaths absorb the content of his thoughts as best they can. If what they learn is difficult to remember or understand, they make a note, a jotting which can be studied later. And as soon as that line of inquiry is exhausted, then that subject, too, is erased.\u0027\n Dolgikh had taken most of this in, but his interest now centred on Zek F\u0026ouml;ener. \u0027That girl, she is very beautiful.\u0027 His gaze was openly lecherous. \u0027Now if only she were a subject for interrogation. My sort of interrogation, of course.\u0027 He gave a coarse chuckle.\n At that exact moment the girl looked up. Her bright blue eyes blazed with fury. She looked directly at the oneway glass, as if. .\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Dolgikh, the word a small gasp. \u0027Impossible! She looks through the glass at us!\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Gerenko shook his head. \u0027She thinks through it - at you, if I\u0027m not mistaken!\u0027\n Foener stood up, strode purposefully to a side door and left the room, emerging into the rubber-floored corridor where the observers stood. She came straight up to them, glanced once at Dolgikh and showed him her perfect, sharp white teeth, then turned to Gerenko. \u0027Ivan, take this... this ape away from here. He\u0027s inside my radius, and his mind\u0027s like a sewer!\u0027\n \u0027Of course, my dear,\u0027 Gerenko smiled and nodded his wrinkled walnut head. He turned away, taking Dolgikh\u0027s elbow. \u0027Come, Theo.\u0027\n Dolgikh shook himself loose, scowled at the girl. \u0027You are very free with your insults.\u0027\n \u0027That is the correct way.\u0027 She spoke curtly. \u0027Face to face and out with it. But your insults crawl like worms, and you keep them in the slime in your head!\u0027 And to Gerenko she added: \u0027I can\u0027t work with him here.\u0027\n Gerenko looked at Dolgikh. \u0027Well?\u0027\n Dolgikh\u0027s expression was ugly, but slowly he relaxed, shrugged. \u0027Very well, my apologies, Fr\u0026auml;ulein F\u0026ouml;ener.\u0027 He deliberately avoided use of his customary \u0027Comrade\u0027; and when he looked her up and down one last time, that too was quite deliberate. \u0027It\u0027s simply that I\u0027ve always considered my thoughts private. And anyway, I\u0027m only human.\u0027\n \u0027Barely!\u0027 she snapped, and at once returned to her work.\n As Dolgikh followed Gerenko to his office, the Second in Command of E-Branch said, \u0027That one\u0027s mind is very finely tuned, finely balanced. We must be careful not to -disturb it. However distasteful this may seem, Theo, you should never forget that any one of the espers here is worth ten of you.\u0027\n Dolgikh had pride. \u0027Oh?\u0027 he growled. \u0027Then why didn\u0027t Andropov ask you to send one of them to Italy, eh? Maybe you yourself, eh, Comrade?\u0027\n Gerenko smiled thinly. \u0027Muscle occasionally has its advantages. That\u0027s why you went to Genoa, and it\u0027s why you\u0027re here now. I expect to have more work for you very soon. Work to your liking. But, Theo, be warned: so far you\u0027ve done very well, so don\u0027t spoil it now. Our mutual, er, shall we say \"superior\", will be well pleased with you. But he would not be pleased if he thought you\u0027d tried to impose your matter over our mind. Here at the Ch\u0026acirc;teau Bronnitsy, its always the other way around - mind over matter!\u0027\n They climbed spiralling stone stairs in one of the Ch\u0026acirc;teau\u0027s towers, and arrived at Gerenko\u0027s office. Before Gerenko it had housed Gregor Borowitz, and it was now Felix Krakovitch\u0027s seat of control; but Krakovitch was temporarily absent, and both Ivan Gerenko and Yuri Andropov intended that his absence should become permanent. This, too, puzzled Dolgikh.\n \u0027In my time,\u0027 he said, taking a seat opposite Gerenko\u0027s desk, \u0027I\u0027ve been quite close to Comrade Andropov - or as close as a man can get. I\u0027ve watched him rise, followed his rising star, you might say. In my experience, since the early days of E-Branch, there has been friction between the KGB and you espers. Yet now, with you, things are changing. What has Andropov got on you, Ivan?\u0027\n Gerenko\u0027s grin was that of a weasel. \u0027He has nothing on me,\u0027 he answered. \u0027But he does have something for me. You see, I have been cheated, Theo. Nature has robbed me. I would like to be a man of heroic proportions\n - perhaps a man like you. But I\u0027m stuck in this feeble shell. Women are not interested in me; men, while they cannot hurt me, consider me a freak. Only my mind has value, and my talent. The first has been useful to Felix Krakovitch: I\u0027ve taken a great deal of the branch\u0027s burden off his shoulders. And the second is a subject for intense study by the parapsychologists here - they would all like\n to have my, shall we say, guardian angel? Why, an army of men with my talent would be quite invulnerable!\n \u0027So you see how important I am. And yet what am I but a shrunken little man, whose lifespan is destined to be short? And so while I live I want power. I want to be great, for however short a span. And because it will be short, I want it now.\u0027\n \u0027And with Krakovitch gone, you\u0027ll be the boss here.\u0027 Dolgikh nodded.\n Gerenko smiled his withered smile. \u0027That for a start. But then comes the integration of E-Branch and the KGB. Brezhnev would be against it, of course, but alas the Party Leader is rapidly becoming a mumbling, crumbling cretin. He can\u0027t last long. And Andropov, because he is strong, has many enemies. How long will he last, do you think? Which means that eventually, possibly, even probably - \u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll have it all!\u0027 Dolgikh could see the logic -of it. \u0027But by then, surely, you too will have made enemies. Leaders always climb to the top over the bodies of dead leaders.\u0027\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 Gerenko\u0027s smile was sly, cold, and not entirely sane. \u0027But this time it will be different. What do I care for enemies? Sticks and stones will not break my bones! And I shall weed them out, one by one, until there are no more. And I shall die small and wrinkled, but also great and very powerful. So whatever you do, Theo Dolgikh, make sure you\u0027re my friend, not my enemy. .\n Dolgikh said nothing for a moment but let all that Gerenko had said sink in. The man was obviously a megalomaniac! Tactfully, Dolgikh changed the subject. \u0027You said there\u0027d likely be more work for me. What sort of work?\u0027\n \u0027As soon as we are sure that we can learn everything we desire to know from Alec Kyle, then Krakovitch, his man Gulharov, and the other British agent, Quint, will become quite expendable. At the moment, when Krakovitch wants something done, he speaks to me and I in turn pass on his request to Brezhnev. Not directly to Brezhnev but through one of his men - a mere lackey, but a powerful lackey. The Party Leader is keen on E-Branch and so Krakovitch usually gets what he wants. Witness this unheard of liaison between British and Soviet espers!\n \u0027But of course I\u0027m also working for Andropov. He, too, knows everything that is happening. And he has already instructed me that when the time comes you are the tool I shall throw-into Krakovitch\u0027s machinery. E-Branch has been soundly beaten, almost destroyed, by INTESP once before. Brezhnev wants to know how and why, and so does Andropov. We had a mighty weapon in Boris Dragosani, but their weapon, a youth called Harry Keogh, was mightier. What gave him his power? What were his powers? And right now: we know that with the aid of INTESP Krakovitch has destroyed something in Romania. I have been through Krakovitch\u0027s files and I think I know what he destroyed: the same thing which gave Dragosani his powers! Krakovitch sees it as a great evil, but I see it only as another tool. A powerful weapon. That is why the British are so eager to help Krakovitch:\n the fool is systematically destroying a possible route for future Soviet supremacy!\u0027\n \u0027Then he\u0027s a traitor?\u0027 Dolgikh\u0027s eyes narrowed. The Soviet Union was all. Power struggles within the structure were only to be expected, but treachery of this sort was something else. \u0027No.\u0027 Gerenko shook his head. \u0027He\u0027s a dupe. Now listen: At this very moment Krakovitch, Gulharov and Quint are stalled at a crossing-point on the Moldavian horder. I organised that through Andropov. I know where they want to go, and very shortly I\u0027ll be sending you to deal with them there. When exactly rather depends on how much we get from Kyle. But in any case we must stop them from doing any more damage. Which means\n that time is of the essence; they can\u0027t be stalled forever, and soon must be allowed to proceed. Also, they know the location of whatever it is they\u0027re seeking, and we do not. Not yet. Tomorrow morning you will be there to follow them to their destination, their ultimate destination. At least I hope so. .\n Dolgikh frowned. \u0027They\u0027ve destroyed something, you say? And they\u0027ll do it again? What sort of something?\u0027\n \u0027If you had been in time to follow them into the Romanian hills, you\u0027d probably have seen for yourself. But don\u0027t worry about it. Let it suffice that this time they mustn\u0027t succeed.\u0027\n As Gerenko finished speaking his telephone rang. He lifted it to his ear - and his expression at once became wary, alert. \u0027Comrade Krakovitch!\u0027 he said. \u0027I was begin-fling to worry about you. I had expected to hear from you before now. Are you in Chernovtsy?\u0027 He looked pointedly across his desk at Dolgikh.\n Even from where he sat, Dolgikh could hear the angry, tinny clatter of Krakovitch\u0027s distant voice. Gerenko began to blink rapidly and a nervous tic jerked the corner of his mouth.\n Finally, when Krakovitch was finished, he said, \u0027Listen, Comrade. Ignore that stupid frontier guard. He isn\u0027t worth losing your temper over. Just stay exactly where you are and in a few minutes I shall have full authorisation phoned through. But first let me speak to that idiot.\u0027\n He waited a moment, until he heard the slightly tremulous, inquiring voice of the border official, and then very quietly said, \u0027Listen. Do you recognise my voice? Good! In approximately ten minutes I shall phone again and tell you I am the commissioner for Frontier Control in Moscow. Ensure that you and you alone answer the phone, and that you can\u0027t be overheard. I will order you to let comrade Krakovitch and his friends through, and you will do so. Do you understand?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes, Comrade!\u0027\n \u0027If Krakovitch should ask you what I have just said, tell him I was shouting at you and calling you a fool.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, of course, Comrade.\u0027\n \u0027Good!\u0027 Gerenko put the phone down. He looked at Dolgikh. \u0027As I was saying, I couldn\u0027t hold them up forever. Already this affair is growing clumsy, becoming embarrassing. But even though they\u0027ll now go through to Chernovtsy, they can do nothing tonight. And tomorrow you\u0027ll be there to stop them doing anything.\u0027\n Dolgikh nodded. \u0027Do you have any suggestions?\u0027\n \u0027In what respect?\u0027\n \u0027About how it should be done? If Krakovitch is a traitor, it seems to me that the easiest way of dealing with this would be - \u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 Gerenko cut him off. \u0027That would be hard to prove. And he has the ear of the Party Leader, remember? We must never leave ourselves open to question in this matter.\u0027 He tapped a finger on his desk, gave the problem a moment\u0027s thought. \u0027Ah! I think I may have it. I have called Krakovitch a dupe - so let it appear. Let Carl Quint be the guilty party! Arrange it so that he can be blamed. Let it be seen that the British espers came into Russia to discover what they could of E-Branch, and to kill its head. Why not? They\u0027ve damaged the branch before, haven\u0027t they? But on this occasion Quint will err and become a fatality of his own strategy.\u0027\n \u0027Good!\u0027 said Dolgikh. \u0027I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll work something out along those lines. And -of course I\u0027ll be the only witness . .\n Light footsteps sounded and Zek Foener appeared on the office threshold. She merely glanced coldly at Dolgikh, then fixed her gaze on Gerenko. \u0027Kyle is a goldmine - the sane part of him, anyway! There is nothing he doesn\u0027t know, and he\u0027s releasing it in a flood. He even knows a\n good many - too many - things about us. Things I didn\u0027t know. Fantastic things...\u0027 Suddenly she looked tired.\n Gerenko nodded. \u0027Fantastic things? I had supposed that they would be. Is that why you think he\u0027s partly insane? That his mind is playing him tricks? Believe me, it isn\u0027t! Do you know what they destroyed in Romania?\u0027\n She nodded. \u0027Yes, but... it\u0027s hard to believe. I - \u0027\n Gerenko held up a warning hand. She understood, felt caution emanating from him. Theo Dolgikh was not to know. Like most of the other espers at the Ch\u0026acirc;teau, Foener hated the KGB. She nodded, and kept her silence.\n Gerenko spoke again. \u0027And is it the same sort of thing that lies hidden in the mountains beyond Chernovtsy?\u0027\n Again she nodded.\n \u0027Very well.\u0027 Gerenko smiled without emotion. \u0027And now, my dear, you must return to your work. Give it total priority.\u0027\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 she answered. \u0027I only came away while they were dosing him again. And because I need a break from...\u0027 She shook her head dazedly. Her eyes were wide, bright with strange new knowledge. \u0027Comrade, this thing is utterly - \u0027\n Again Gerenko held up his child\u0027s hand in warning. \u0027I know.\u0027\n She nodded, turned and left, her footsteps a little uncertain on the descending stone stairs.\n \u0027What was all that about?\u0027 Dolgikh was mystified.\n \u0027That was the joint death certificate of Krakovitch, Gulharov and Quint,\u0027 Gerenko answered. \u0027Actually, Quint was the only one who might have been useful - but no longer. Now you can get on your way. Is the branch helicopter ready for you?\u0027\n Dolgikh nodded. He began to stand up, then frowned and said, \u0027First tell me, what will happen to Kyle when you are finished with him? I mean, I\u0027ll take care of that\n other pair of traitors, and the British esper, Quint, but what of Kyle? What will become of him?\u0027\n Gerenko raised his eyebrows. \u0027I thought that was obvious. When we have what we want, everything we want, then we\u0027ll dump him in the British zone in Berlin. There he\u0027ll simply die, and their best doctors won\u0027t know why.\u0027\n \u0027But why will he die? And what of that drug you\u0027re pumping into him? Surely their doctors will pick up traces?\u0027\n Gerenko shook his walnut head. \u0027It leaves no trace. It completely voids itself in a few hours. That is why we have to keep dosing him. A clever lot, our Bulgarian friends. He\u0027s not the first one we\u0027ve drained in this fashion, and the results have always been the same. As to why he will die: he will have no incentive for life. Less than a cabbage, he will not retain sufficient knowledge or instinct even to move his body. There will be no control - none! His vital organs will not function. He might survive longer on a life-support machine, but...\u0027 And he shrugged.\n \u0027Brain-death.\u0027 Dolgikh nodded and grinned.\n \u0027But there you have it in a nutshell.\u0027 Gerenko emotionlessly clapped his child\u0027s hands. \u0027Bravo! For what is an entirely empty brain if not dead, eh? And now, if you\u0027ll excuse me, I have a telephone call to make.\u0027\n Dolgikh stood up. \u0027I\u0027ll be on my way,\u0027 he said. Already he was looking forward to the task in hand.\n \u0027Theo,\u0027 said Gerenko. \u0027Krakovitch and his friends - they should be killed with despatch. Don\u0027t linger over it. And one last thing: do not be too curious about what they are trying to do up there in the mountains. Do not concern yourself with it. Believe me, too much curiosity could be very, very dangerous!\u0027\n In answer to which Dolgikh could only nod. Then he turned and left the room . .\n As their car drew away from the checkpoint towards Chernovtsy, Quint might have expected Krakovitch to carry on raging. But he didn\u0027t. Instead the head of the Soviet E-Branch was quiet and thoughtful, and even more so after Gulharov quickly told him about the disconnected cable.\n \u0027There are several things I not liking here,\u0027 Krakovitch told Quint in a little while. \u0027At first I am thinking that fat man back there is simply stupid, but now not being so sure. And this business with the electricity - all very strange. Sergei finds and fixes that which they could not - and he does it quickly and without difficulty. Which would seem to make our fat friend at the checkpoint not only stupid but incompetent!\u0027\n \u0027You think we were deliberately delayed?\u0027 Quint felt an uneasy, dark oppressiveness settling all around him, like a positive weight on his head and shoulders.\n \u0027That telephone call he got just now,\u0027 Krakovitch mused. \u0027The Commissioner for Frontier Control, in Moscow? I never heard of him! But I suppose he must exist. Or must he? One commissioner, controlling all of the thousands of crossing points into the Soviet Union? So, I assume he exists. Which is meaning that Ivan Gerenko got in touch with him, in the dead of night, and that he then personally called up this little fat official in his stupid sentry-box of a control hut - all in ten minutes!\u0027\n \u0027Who knew we were coming through here tonight?\u0027 Quint, in his way of going to the root of things, asked the most obvious question.\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Krakovitch scratched behind his ear. \u0027We knew it, of course, and - \u0027\n \u0027And?\u0027\n \u0027And my Second in Command at the Ch\u0026acirc;teau Bronnitsy, Ivan Gerenko.\u0027 Krakovitch turned to Quint and stared hard at him.\n \u0027Then, while I dislike saying it,\u0027 said Quint, \u0027if there is something funny going on, Gerenko has to be your man.\u0027\n Krakovitch gave a disbelieving snort, shook his head. \u0027But why? What reason?\u0027\n Quint shrugged. \u0027You have to know him better than I do. Is he ambitious? Could he have been got at - and by whom? But remember, we did have that trouble in Genoa, and didn\u0027t you remark how surprised you were that the KGB were trailing you? Your explanation was that they\u0027d probably had you under constant surveillance\n - until we put a stop to it, anyway. But just let\u0027s suppose there is an enemy in your camp. Did Gerenko know you were meeting us in Italy?\u0027\n \u0027Apart from Brezhnev himself - through an intermediary who cannot be brought into question - Gerenko is the only one who knew!\u0027 Krakovitch answered.\n Quint said nothing, merely shrugged again and raised an eyebrow.\n \u0027I am thinking,\u0027 said Krakovitch slowly, \u0027that from now on I tell no one how I moving until after the move is completed!\u0027 He looked at Quint, saw his troubled frown. \u0027Is there something else?\u0027\n Quint pursed his lips. \u0027Let\u0027s just say this Gerenko fellow is a plant, a spy in your organisation. Am I right in thinking he can only be working for the KGB?\u0027\n \u0027For Andropov, yes. Almost certainly.\u0027\n \u0027Then Gerenko must think you\u0027re a complete fool!\u0027\n \u0027Oh? Why do you say so? In fact he thinks most men are fools. He fears no one, Gerenko, and so can afford to think so. But I? No, I believe I am one of the few men who he respects - or used to.\u0027\n \u0027Used to,\u0027 Quint nodded. \u0027But no more. Surely he must know you\u0027ll work all of this out for yourself given a little time? Theo Dolgikh in Genoa, and now this shambles at the Romano-Soviet border? Unless he himself is an idiot,\n Gerenko must know he\u0027s for the high-jump as soon as you get back to Moscow!\u0027\n Sergei Gulharov had managed to understand most of this. Now he spoke to Krakovitch in a soft, rapid burst of Russian.\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Krakovitch\u0027s shoulders jerked in a humourless chuckle. For a moment he was silent, then he said, \u0027Perhaps Sergei is smarter than all of us. And if he is, then we\u0027re in for trouble.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 said Quint. \u0027What did Sergei say?\u0027\n \u0027He said, perhaps Comrade Gerenko feels that he can now afford to be a little slipshod. Perhaps he isn\u0027t expecting to see me again in Moscow! And as for you, Carl - we just crossed the border and you\u0027re in Russia.\u0027\n \u0027I know,\u0027 Quint quietly answered. \u0027And I must say, I don\u0027t exactly feel at home.\u0027\n \u0027Strangely,\u0027 Krakovitch nodded, \u0027neither do I!\u0027\n Nothing more was said until they reached Chernovtsy. .\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-ii-wamphyri-necroscope-2/page-14.html","bookId":2117,"book":{"id":2117,"title":"Necroscope II: Wamphyri (Necroscope #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The spirit of Harry Keogh now resides in his son, Harry Jr. When his infant son sleeps, Harry can roam the Continuum and speak to the dead, but is gradually losing his control as the son \"reels\" his father\u0027s spirit back in.
