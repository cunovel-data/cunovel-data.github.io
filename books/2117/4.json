{"id":92835,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Yulian had been a late baby, late by almost a month, though in the circumstances his mother considered herself fortunate that he hadn\u0027t been born early. Or very early and dead! Now, on the spacious back seat of her cousin Anne\u0027s Mercedes, on their way to Yulian\u0027s christening at a tiny church in Harrow, Georgina Bodescu steadied the infant in his portable cot and thought back on those circumstances: on that time almost a year before when she and her husband had holidayed in Slatina, only eighty kilometres from the wild and ominously rearing bastions of the Carpatii Meridionali, the Transylvanian Alps. A year is a long time and she could do it now - look back - without any longer feeling that she too must die, without submitting to slow, hot tears and an agony of self-reproach bordering on guilt. That\u0027s how she had felt for long, long months: guilty. Guilty that she lived when Ilya was dead, and that but for her weakness he, too, might still be alive. Guilty that she had fainted at the sight of his blood, when she should have run like the wind to fetch help. And poor Ilya lying there, made unconscious by his pain, his life\u0027s blood leaking out of him into the dark earth, while she lay crumpled in a swoon like... like some typically English shrinking violet. Oh, yes, she could look back now - indeed she had to - for they had been Ilya\u0027s last days, which she had been part of. She had loved him very, very much and did not want to lose grasp of her memory of him. If only in looking back she could conjure all the good things without invoking the nightmare, then she would be happy. But of course she couldn\u0027t... Ilya Bodescu, a Romanian, had been teaching Slavonic languages in London when Georgina first met him. A linguist, he moved between Bucharest, where he taught French and English, and the European Institute in Regent Street where she had studied Bulgarian (her grandfather on her mother\u0027s side, a dealer in wines, had come from Sofia). Ilya had only occasionally been her tutor ï¿½C when standing in for a huge-breasted, moustachioed, matron from Pleven - at which times his dry wit and dark, sparkling eyes had transformed what were otherwise laborious hours of learning into all too short periods of pure pleasure. Love at first sight? Not in the light of twelve years\u0027 hindsight - but a rapid enough process by any estimation. They had married inside a year, Ilya\u0027s usual term with the Institute. When the year was up, she\u0027d gone back to Bucharest with him. That had been in November of \u002747. Things had not been entirely easy. Georgina Drew\u0027s parents were fairly well-to-do; her father in the diplomatic service had had several prestigious postings abroad, and her mother too was from a moneyed background. An ex-deb turned auxiliary nurse during the First World War, she had met John Drew in a field hospital in France where she nursed his bad leg wound. This kept him out of the rest of the fighting until she could return home with him. They married in the summer of 1917. When Georgina had introduced Ilya to her parents, his reception had been more than a little stiff. For years her father, severely British, had been \u0027living down\u0027 the fact \u0027that his wife was of Bulgarian stock, and now here was his daughter bringing home a damned gypsy! It hadn\u0027t been that open, but Georgina had known what her father had thought of it all right. Her mother hadn\u0027t been quite so bad, but was too fond of remembering how \u0027Papa never much trusted the \"Wallachs\" across the border\u0027, a distrust which she put forward as one of the reasons he\u0027d emigrated to England in the first place. In short, Ilya had not been made to feel at home. Sadly, within the space of eight more years - split evenly for Georgina and Ilya between Bucharest and London - time had caught up with both of her parents. All squabbles were long forgotten by then and Georgina had been left fairly well off - which was as well. In those early years Ilya certainly wasn\u0027t earning enough from his teaching to keep her in her accustomed style. But it was then that Ilya had been offered a lucrative position as an interpreter-translator with the Foreign Office in London; for while in life Georgina\u0027s father had once been something of a pain, in death his legacy included an excellent introduction to diplomatic circles. There was one condition: to secure the position Ilya must first become a British citizen. This was no hardship - he\u0027d intended it anyway, eventually, when the right opportunity presented itself - but he did have a final term\u0027s contract at the Institute, and one more year to complete in Bucharest, before he could take up the position. That last year in Romania had been a sad one - because of the knowledge that it was the last - but towards the end of his term Ilya had been glad. The war was eleven years in the past and the air of the reviving cities had not been good for him. London had been smog and Bucharest fog, both were laden with exhaust fumes and, for Ilya, the taint of mouldering books in libraries and classrooms too. His health had suffered a little. They could have come back to England as soon as he\u0027d fulfilled his duties, but a doctor in Bucharest advised against it. \u0027Stay through the winter,\u0027 he\u0027d counselled, \u0027but not in the city. Get out into the countryside. Long walks in the clean, fresh air - that\u0027s what you need. Evenings by a roaring log fire, just taking it easy. Knowing that the snow lies deep without, and that you\u0027re all warm within! There\u0027s a deal of satisfaction in that. It makes you glad you\u0027re alive.\u0027 It had seemed sound advice. Ilya wasn\u0027t due to start working at the Foreign Office until the end of May; they spent Christmas in Bucharest with friends; then, early in the new year, they took the train for Slatina under the Alps. In fact the town was on the slopes gentling up to the foothills, but the locals always spoke of it as being \u0027under the Alps\u0027. There they hired an old barn of a place set back from the highway to Pitesti, settling in just before the coming of the first real snows of the year. By the end of January the snowploughs were out, clearing the roads, their blue exhaust smoke acrid in the sharp, smarting air; the townspeople went about their business with a great stamping of feet; they were muffled to their ears, more like great bundles of clothing than people. Ilya and Georgina roasted chestnuts on their blazing, open hearth fire and made plans for the future. Until now they\u0027d held back from a family, for their lives had seemed too unsettled. But now... now it felt right to start. In fact they\u0027d started almost two months earlier, but Georgina couldn\u0027t be sure yet. She had her suspicions, though. Days would find them in town - when the snow would allow - and nights they were here in their rambling hiring, reading or making languid love before the fire. Usually the latter. Within a month of leaving Bucharest Ilya\u0027s irritating cough had disappeared and much of his former strength had returned. With typical Romanian zeal, he revelled in expending much of it on Georgina. It had been like a second honeymoon. Mid-February and the impossible happened: three consecutive days of clear skies and bright sunshine, and all of the snow steaming away, so that on the morning of the fourth day it looked almost like an early spring. \u0027Another two or three days of fair weather,\u0027 the locals nodded knowingly, \u0027and then you\u0027ll see snow like you\u0027ve never seen it! So enjoy what we\u0027ve got while you can.\u0027 Ilya and Georgina had determined to do just that. Over the years and under Ilya\u0027s tuition, Georgina had become quite handy on a pair of skis. It might be a very long time before they got the chance again. Down here on the so-called steppe, all that remained of the snow were dark grey piles heaped at the roadsides; a few kilometres up country towards the Alps, however, there was still plenty to be found. Ilya hired a car for a couple of days - a beat-up old Volkswagen beetle - and skis, and by 1.30 P.M. on that fateful fourth day they had motored up into the foothills. For lunch they stopped at a tiny inn on the northern extreme of lonesti, ordering goulash which they washed down with thick coffee, followed by a single shot each of sharp slivovitz to clean their mouths. Then on higher into the hills, to a region where the snow still lay thick on the fields and hedgerows. And there it was that Ilya spied the hump of low grey hills a mile or so to the west, and turned off the road on to a track to try to get a little closer. Finally the track had become rutted under the drifted snow, and the snow itself deeper, until at last Ilya had grunted his annoyance. Not wanting to get bogged down, revving the little car\u0027s engine, he\u0027d bumpily turned it about in its own tracks, the better to make an easy getaway when they were through with their sport. \u0027Landlaufen!\u0027 he\u0027d declared, getting down their skis from the roof rack. Georgina had groaned. \u0027Cross-country? All the way to those hills?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re white!\u0027 he declared. \u0027Glittery with dust over the hard, firm crust. Perfect! Maybe half a mile there, a slow climb to the top and a controlled, enjoyable slalom through the trees, then back here just as the twilight\u0027s coming down on us.\u0027 \u0027But it\u0027s after three now!\u0027 she\u0027d protested.Then we\u0027d better get a move on. Come on, it\u0027ll be good for us...\u0027 \u0027Good for us!\u0027 Georgina sadly repeated now, his picture still clear in her mind a year later, tall and darkly handsome as he lifted the skis from the beetle\u0027s roof and tossed them down in the snow. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 Anne Drew, her younger cousin, glanced back at her over her shoulder. \u0027Did you say something?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Georgina smiled wanly, shaking her head. She was glad for the intrusion of another into her memories, but at the same time sorry. Ilya\u0027s face, fading, hung in the air, superimposed over her cousin\u0027s. \u0027Daydreaming, that\u0027s all.\u0027 Anne frowned, turned back to her driving. Daydreaming, she thought. Yes, and Georgina had done a lot of that over the last twelve months. There\u0027d seemed to be something in her, something other than little Yulian, that is, which hadn\u0027t come out of her when he had. Grief, yes, of course, but more than that. It was as if she\u0027d teetered for twelve months on the very edge of a nervous break-down, and that only Ilya\u0027s continuation in Yulian had kept her from toppling. As for daydreams: sometimes she\u0027d seemed so very far away, so detached from the real world, that it had been difficult to call her back. But now, with the baby... now she had something to cling to, an anchor, something to live for. Good for us, Georgina said again, but this time to herself, bitterly. It hadn\u0027t been \u0027good\u0027 for them, that last fatal frolic in the snow on the cruciform hills. Anything but. It had been terrible, tragic. A nightmare she\u0027d lived through a thou-sand times in the year gone by, with ten thousand more to come, she was sure. Lulled by the car\u0027s warmth and the purr of its motor, she slipped back into her memories... They\u0027d found an old firebreak in the side of the hill and set out to climb it to the top, pausing now and then with their breath pluming, shielding their eyes against the white blaze. But by the time they\u0027d pantingly reached the crest the sun had been low and the light starting to fade. \u0027From now on it\u0027s all downhill,\u0027 Ilya had pointed out. \u0027A brisk slalom through the saplings grown up in the firebreak, then a slow glide back to the car. Ready? Then here we go!\u0027 And the rest of it had been... disaster! The saplings he\u0027d mentioned were in fact half-grown trees. The snow, drifted into the firebreak, was far deeper than he might have guessed, so that only the tops of the pines - looking like saplings - stood proud of the powdery white surface. Half-way down he\u0027d skied too close to one such; a branch, just under the surface, showing as the merest tuft of green, had tangled his right-hand ski. He\u0027d upended, bounced and skittered and jarred another twenty-five yards in a whirling bundle of white anorak, sticks and skis, flailing arms and legs before grabbing another \u0027sapling\u0027 and bringing his careening descent to a halt. Georgina, well to his rear and skiing a little more timidly, saw it all. Her heart seemed to fly into her mouth and she cried out, then formed a snow-plough of her skis and drew up alongside her husband where he sprawled. She\u0027d stepped out of her clamps at once, dug her skis in so that she couldn\u0027t lose them, gone down on her knees beside him. Ilya held his sides as he laughed and laughed, the tears of laughter rolling down his cheeks and freezing there. \u0027Clown!\u0027 She\u0027d thumped his chest then. \u0027Oh, you clown! You very nearly frightened the life out of me!\u0027 He had laughed all the louder, grabbing her wrists, holding her still. Then he\u0027d looked at his skis and stopped laughing. The right ski was broken, hanging by a splinter where it had cracked across its width some six inches in front of the clamp. \u0027Ah!\u0027 he had exclaimed then, frown-ling. And he\u0027d sat up in the snow and looked all about, Georgina had known, then, that it was serious. She could see it in his eyes, the way they narrowed. \u0027You go back to the car,\u0027 he\u0027d told her. \u0027But carefully, mind you - don\u0027t be like me and go banging your skis up! Start the car and get the heater going. It\u0027s not much more than a mile, so by the time I get back you\u0027ll have that old beetle good and warm for me. No point both of us freezing.\u0027 \u0027No!\u0027 She\u0027d refused point-blank. \u0027We go back together. I-\u0027 \u0027Georgina.\u0027 He\u0027d spoken quietly, which meant that he was getting angry. \u0027Look, if we go back together, it means we\u0027ll both get back wet, tired, and very, very cold. Now that\u0027s OK for me, and I deserve it, but you don\u0027t. My way you\u0027ll soon be warm, and I\u0027ll be warm a lot sooner! Also, night is coming on. You get back to the car now, in the twilight, and you\u0027ll be able to put on the lights as a marker. You can beep the horn now and then to let me know you\u0027re safe and warm, and to give me an incentive. You see?\u0027 She had seen, but his arguments hadn\u0027t swayed her. \u0027If we stick together, at least we\u0027ll be together! What if I did fall down and get stuck, eh? You\u0027d get back to the car and I wouldn\u0027t be there. What then? Ilya, I\u0027d be frightened on my own. For myself and for you!\u0027 For a second his eyes had narrowed more yet. But then he\u0027d nodded. \u0027You\u0027re right, of course.\u0027 And again he\u0027d looked all about. Then, taking off his skis: \u0027Very well, this is what we\u0027ll do. Look down there.\u0027 The firebreak had continued for maybe another half kilometre, running steeply downhill. To both sides full-grown trees, some of them hoary with age, stood thick and dark, with the snow drifted in banks under them where they bordered the firebreak. They stood so close that overhead their branches often interlocked. They hadn\u0027t been cut for five hundred years, those trees. Beneath them the snow was mostly patchy, kept from the earth by the thick fir canopy, which it covered like a mantle. The car\u0027s over there,\u0027 said Ilya, pointing east, \u0027around the curve of the hill and behind the trees. We\u0027ll cut through the trees downhill to the track, then follow our own ski-tracks back to the car. Cutting off the corner will save us maybe half a kilometre, and it will be a lot easier than walking in deep snow. Easier for me, anyway. Once we\u0027re back on the track you can go on skis, a gentle glide; and when the car\u0027s in sight, then you can go on ahead and get her going. But we\u0027ll have to get a move on. It will be gloomy now under those trees, and in another half-hour the sun will be down. We won\u0027t want to be in the wood too long after that.\u0027 Then he\u0027d hoisted Georgina\u0027s skis to his shoulder and they\u0027d left the firebreak for the shelter and the silence of the trees. At first they\u0027d made good headway, so good in fact that she had almost stopped worrying. But there was that about the hillside which oppressed - a quiet too intense, a sense of ages passing or passed like a few ticks of some vast clock, and of something waiting, watching - so that she only desired to get down off the hill and back out into the open. She supposed that Ilya felt it, too, this strange genius loci, for he had said very little and even his breathing was quiet as they made their way diagonally down through the trees, moving from bole to black bole, avoiding the more precipitous places as much as possible. Then they had reached a place where leaning stumps of stone, the bedrock itself, stuck up through the soil and leaf-mould; following which they had to negotiate an almost sheer face of crumbling rock down to a levelled area. And as he helped her down, so they had noticed the handiwork of man there under the dark trees. They stood upon lichen-clad stone flags in front of ...a mausoleum? That\u0027s what the tumbled ruins had looked like, anyway. But here? Georgina had nervously clutched Ilya\u0027s arm. This could hardly be considered a holy place or hallowed ground, not by any stretch of the imagination. It seemed that unseen presences moved here, lending their motion to the musty air without disturbing the festoons of cobwebs and dangling fingers of dead twigs that hung down from higher areas of gloom. It was a cold place - but lacking the normal, invigorating cold of winter - where the sun had only rarely broken through in ... how many centuries? Hewn from the raw stone of the hillside itself, the tomb had long since caved in; most of its roof of massive slabs lay in a tangle of broken masonry, where the flags of the floor were cracked and arched upwards from the achingly slow groping of great roots. A broken stone joist, leaning now against the thickly matted ruin of a side wall, had once formed the lintel above the tomb\u0027s wide entrance; it bore a vague motif or coat of arms, hard to make out in the gloom. Ilya, who had always had a fascination for antiquities of all sorts, had gone to kneel beside the great sloping slab and gouge dirt from its carved legend. \u0027Well, now!\u0027 his voice had sounded hushed. \u0027And what are we to make of this, eh?\u0027 Georgina had shuddered. \u0027I don\u0027t want to make any-thing of it! This is an entirely horrid place. Come away, let\u0027s go on.\u0027 \u0027But look - there are heraldic markings here. At least I suppose that\u0027s what they are. This one, at the bottom is ... a dragon? Yes, with one forepaw raised, see? And above it -I can\u0027t quite make it out.\u0027 \u0027Because the sun is setting!\u0027 she\u0027d cried. \u0027It\u0027s getting gloomier by the moment.\u0027 But she had gone to peer over his shoulder anyway. The dragon had been quite clearly worked, a proud-looking creature chipped from the stone. \u0027And that\u0027s a bat!\u0027 Georgina had said at once. \u0027A bat in flight, over the dragon\u0027s back.\u0027 Ilya had hurriedly cleaned away more dirt and lichen from the old chiselled grooves, and a third carved symbol had come to light. But the great lintel, which had seemed firmly enough bedded, had suddenly shifted, started to topple as the rotting wall gave way. Pushing Georgina back, Ilya had thrown himself off balance. Trying to scramble backwards himself, he\u0027d somehow got his leg sticking straight out in front of him, directly under the toppling lintel. Still sprawling there as the slab fell, his cry of agony and the nerve-grating crunch as his leg broke and jagged bone sheared through his flesh came simultaneous with Georgina\u0027s scream. Then, perhaps mercifully, he had lost consciousness. She had leaped to free him from the lintel, only to discover that while it had broken his leg, it had not trapped him. The lower part of his leg flopped uselessly and fell at an odd angle when she touched it, but miraculously it was not pinned. Then Georgina had seen and felt the break, the splintered bone projecting through red flesh and cloth, and the repetitive spurt of blood against her hands and jacket. And that, until the moment of her awakening, had been the last that Georgina saw, felt or heard. Or rather, she had seen one other thing, and then forgotten it at once as she slumped to the ground. The thing she saw had remained forgotten, or more properly suppressed: it was the third symbol, carved above the dragon and the bat, which had seemed to leer at her even as the blackness closed in ... \u0027Georgy? We\u0027re there!\u0027 Anne\u0027s voice broke the spell. Georgina, reclining in the back of the car, eyes almost closed in her suddenly pale face, gave a start and sat upright. She had been on the verge of remembering something about the place where Ilya died, something she hadn\u0027t wanted to remember. Now she gulped air grate-fully, forced a smile. \u0027There already?\u0027 She managed to get the words out. \u0027I ... I must have been miles away!\u0027 Anne pulled the big car into the car park behind the church, braking to a gentle halt. Then she turned to look at her passenger. \u0027Are you sure you\u0027re all right?\u0027 Georgina nodded. \u0027Yes, I\u0027m fine. Maybe a little tired, that\u0027s all. Come on, help me with the carry-cot.\u0027 The church was of old stone, all stained glass and Gothic arches, with a cemetery to one side where the headstones were leaning and crusted with grey-green lichens. Georgina couldn\u0027t bear lichens, especially when they covered old legends gouged in leaning slabs. She looked the other way as she hurried by the graveyard and turned left around the buttressed corner of the church towards its entrance. Anne, almost dragged along on the other handle of the carry-cot, had to break into a trot to keep up. \u0027Goodness!\u0027 she protested. \u0027You\u0027d think we were late or something!\u0027 And in fact they were, almost. Waiting on the steps in front of the church, there stood Anne\u0027s fianc6, George Lake. They had lived together for three years and only just set a date; and they were to be Yulian\u0027s godparents. There had been several christenings this morning; the most recent party of beaming parents, godparents and relatives was just leaving, the mother radiant as she held her child in its christening-gown. George skipped by them, came hurrying down the steps, took the carry-cot and said, \u0027I sat through the entire service, four christenings, all that mumbling and muttering and splashing - and screaming! But I thought it was only right that one of us be here from start to finish. But the old vicar - Lord, he\u0027s a boring old fart! God forgive me!\u0027 George and Anne might well have been brother and sister, even twins. Toss opposites attracting out the window, thought Georgina. They were both five-ninish, a bit plump if not actually fat; both blondes, grey eyed, soft-spoken. A few weeks separated their birth-dates: George was a Sagittarius and Anne a Capricorn. Typically, he would sometimes put his foot in it; she had sufficient of her sign\u0027s stability to pull him out of it. That was Anne\u0027s interpretation of their relationship, she being a lifelong advocate of astrology. Leaving Georgina\u0027s hands free to tidy herself up a little, they now took the carry-cot between them and made to enter the church. The twin doors were of oak under a Gothic arch, one standing half open outwards on to the landing at the head of the steps. A wind came up from nowhere, blew yesterday\u0027s confetti up in mad swirls and slammed the door resoundingly in their faces. Earlier there had been the odd ray of sunshine filtering through wispy grey clouds, but now the clouds seemed to mass, the sun was switched off like a light and it grew noticeably darker. \u0027Not cold enough for snow,\u0027 said George, turning his eyes apprehensively up to the sky. \u0027My guess is it\u0027s going to chuck it down!\u0027 \u0027Chuck it or bucket?\u0027 Anne was still reeling from the door\u0027s slamming, her expression puzzled. \u0027Fuck it!\u0027 said George, irreverently. \u0027Let\u0027s get in!\u0027 A moment more and the door was shoved open from inside by the vicar. He was lean, getting on a bit in years, close to bald. His one advantage was of great height, so that he could look down on them all. He had little eyes made huge by thick-lensed spectacles, and a veined beak of a nose that seemed to turn his head as if it were a weathercock. His thinness gave the impression of a mantis, but at the same time he managed to look owlish. A bird of pray! thought George, and grinned to himself. But at the same time he noted that the old vicar\u0027s handshake was warm and full of comfort, however trembly, and that his smile was a beam of pure goodness. Nor was he lacking in his own brand of dry wit. \u0027So glad you could make it,\u0027 he smiled, and nodded over Yulian in his carry-cot. The baby was awake, his round eyes moving to and fro. The vicar chucked him under his chubby chin, said, \u0027Young man, it\u0027s always a good idea to be early for one\u0027s christening, punctual for one\u0027s wedding, and as late as one can get for one\u0027s funeral!\u0027 Then he peered frowningly at the door. The freak gust of wind had disappeared, taking its confetti with it. \u0027What happened here?\u0027 the old man lifted his eyebrows. \u0027That\u0027s odd! I had thought the bolt was home. But in any case, it takes a wind of some power to slam shut a door heavy as this one. Perhaps we\u0027re in for a storm.\u0027 At the foot of the door a bolt dragged squealingly along the groove it had worn in old stone flags, and thudded down into its bolthole as the vicar gave the door a final push. \u0027There!\u0027 He wiped his hands, nodded his satisfaction. Not such a boring old fart after all, all three thought the identical thought as he led them inside and up to the font. In his time, the old clergyman had baptised Georgina; he\u0027d married her, too, and was aware that she was now a widow. This was the church her parents had attended for most of their declining years, the church her father had attended as a boy and young man. There was no need for long preliminaries, and so he began at once. As George and Anne put the cot down, and as Georgina took up Yulian in her arms, he began to intone: \u0027Hath this child been already baptised, or no?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Georgina shook her head. \u0027Dearly beloved,\u0027 the vicar began in earnest, \u0027foreasmuch as all men are conceived and born in sin - \u0027 Sin, thought Georgina, the old man\u0027s words flowing over her. Yulian wasn\u0027t conceived in sin. This had ever been a part of the service that got her back up. Sin, indeed! Conceived in joy and love and sweetest sweet pleasure, yes - unless pleasure were to be construed as sin... She looked down at Yulian in her arms; he was alert, staring at the vicar as he mumbled over his book. It was a funny expression on the baby\u0027s face: not quite vacant, not exactly a drool. Somehow intense. They had all kinds of looks, babies. \u0027... that thou wilt mercifully look upon this child; wash him, sanctify him with the Holy Ghost; that he, being - \u0027 The Holy Ghost. Ghosts had stirred under those stirless trees on the cruciform hills, but in no way holy ones. Unholy ones! Thunder rumbled distantly and the high stained glass windows brightened momentarily from a far flash of lightning before falling into deeper gloom. A light burned over the font, however, sufficient for the vicar\u0027s eyes behind their thick lenses. He shivered visibly as he read his lines, for suddenly the temperature had seemed to fall dramatically. The old man paused for a moment, looked up and blinked. His eyes went from the faces of the three adults to the baby, paused there for a moment, blinked rapidly. He looked at the light over the font, then at the high windows. For all his shivering, sweat gleamed on his brow and upper lip. \u0027I... I...\u0027 he said. \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 George was concerned. He took the vicar\u0027s arm. \u0027A cold,\u0027 the old man tried to smile, only succeeding in looking sick. His lips seemed to stick to his teeth, which were false and rather loose, and he was immediately apologetic. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but this is not really surprising. A draughty place, you know? But don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t let you down. We\u0027ll get this finished. It just came on so quickly, that\u0027s all.\u0027 The sick smile twitched from his face. \u0027After this,\u0027 said Anne, \u0027you should spend what\u0027s left of the weekend in bed!\u0027 \u0027I believe I will, my dear.\u0027 Fumblingly, the vicar went back to his text. Georgina said nothing. She felt the strangeness. Some-thing was unreal, out of focus. Did churches frown? This one was frowning. It had been hostile from the moment they\u0027d arrived. That\u0027s what was wrong with the vicar: he could feel it too, but he didn\u0027t know what it was. But how do I know what it is? Georgina wondered. Have I felt it before? \u0027... They brought young children to Christ, that he should touch them; and his disciples rebuked those that brought them...\u0027 Georgina felt the church groaning around her, trying to expel her. No, trying to expel... Yulian? She looked at the baby and he looked back: his face broke into that unsmile which small babies smile. But his eyes were fixed, steady, unblinking. Even as she stared at him, she saw those darling eyes swivel in their sockets to gaze full upon the old vicar. Nothing wrong with that - it was just that it had looked so deliberate. Yulian is ordinary! Georgina denied what she was thinking. She\u0027d had this feeling before and denied it, and now she must do it again. He is ordinary! It was her, not the baby. She was blaming him for Ilya. It was the only explanation. She glanced at George and Anne, and they smiled back reassuringly. Didn\u0027t they feel the cold, the strangeness? They obviously thought she was concerned about the vicar, the service. Other than that, they felt nothing. Oh, maybe they felt how draughty the place was, but that was all. Georgina felt more than the cold. And so did the vicar. He was skipping lines now, hurrying through the service almost mechanically, about as human as some gaunt robot penguin. He avoided looking at them, especially Yulian. Maybe he could feel the infant\u0027s eyes on him, unwaveringly. \u0027Dearly beloved,\u0027 the old man was chanting at Anne and George now, the godparents, \u0027ye have brought this child here to be baptised...\u0027 I have to stop it. Georgina\u0027s thoughts were growing wilder. She started to panic. Have to, before it - but before what? - happens! \u0027...to release him of his sins, to sanctify him with... Outside, much closer now, thunder rumbled, accompanied by lightning that lit up the west-facing windows and sent kaleidoscopic beams of bright colours lancing through the interior. The group about the font was first gold, then green, finally crimson. Yulian was blood in Georgina\u0027s arms; his eyes were blood where they stared at the vicar. At the back of the church, under the pulpit, almost unnoticed all of this time, a funereal man had been sweeping up, his broom scraping on the stone flags. Now, for no apparent reason, he threw the broom down, tore off his apron and rolled it up, almost ran from the church. He could be heard grumbling to himself, angry about something. Another flash of lightning turned him blue, green, finally white as an undeveloped photograph as he reached the door and plunged out of sight. \u0027Eccentric!\u0027 The vicar, seeming a little more in control of himself, frowned after him, blinked at his abrupt disappearance. \u0027He cleans the church because he has a \"feel\" for it! So he tells me.\u0027 \u0027Er, can we get on?\u0027 George had apparently had enough of interruptions. \u0027Of course, of course,\u0027 the old man peered again at his book, skipped several more lines. \u0027Er... promise that you are his sureties, that he will renounce the devil and all his works, and constantly believe...\u0027 Yulian had also had enough. He began to kick, gathered air for a howling session. His face puffed up and started to turn a little blue, which would normally mean that frustration and anger were coming to the boil just beneath the surface. Georgina couldn\u0027t keep back a great sigh of relief at that. What was Yulian but a helpless baby after all? \u0027... the carnal desires of the flesh... was crucified, dead, and buried; that he went down into hell, and also did rise again the third day; that he...\u0027 Just a baby, thought Georgina, with Ilya\u0027s blood, and mine, and... and? \u0027... the quick and the dead?\u0027 The church was thunder dark, the storm almost directly overhead. \u0027... resurrection of the flesh; and everlasting life after death?\u0027 Georgina gave a start as Anne and George answered in unison: \u0027All this we steadfastly believe.\u0027 \u0027Wilt he then be baptised in this faith?\u0027 George and Anne again: \u0027That is his desire.\u0027 But Yulian denied it! He gave a howl to raise the rafters, jerked and kicked with an astonishing strength where his mother cradled him. The old clergyman sensed trouble brewing - not the real trouble but trouble anyway - and decided not to prolong things. He took the baby from Georgina\u0027s arms. Yulian\u0027s white christening-gown was a haze of almost neon light, himself a pink pulsation in its folds. Above the baby\u0027s howling, the old vicar said to George and Anne: \u0027Name this child.\u0027 \u0027Yulian,\u0027 they answered simply. \u0027Yulian,\u0027 he nodded, \u0027I baptise thee in the name of - \u0027 He paused, stared at the baby. His right hand - practised, accustomed, of its own accord - had dipped into the font, lifted water, poised dripping. Yulian continued to howl. Anne and George and Georgina heard his crying, only that. No longer touching her child, Georgina felt suddenly free, unburdened, separate from what was coming. It was not her doing; she was merely an observer; this priest must bear the brunt of his own ritual. She, too, heard only Yulian\u0027s crying - but she felt the approach of something enormous. To the vicar the infant\u0027s howling had taken on a new note. It was no longer the cry of a child but a beast. His jaw dropped and he looked up, blinking rapidly as he peered from face to face: George and Anne smiling, if a little uncomfortably, and Georgina, looking small and wan. And then he looked again at Yulian. The baby was issuing grunts, animal grunts of rage! Its crying was only a cover, like perfume masking the stink of ordure. Underneath was the bass croaking of utter Horror! Automatically, his hand trembling like a leaf in a gale, the old man splashed a little water on the infant\u0027s fevered brow, traced a cross there with his finger. The water might well have been acid! NO! the thunderous croaking formed a denial. PUT NO CROSS ON ME, YOU TREACHEROUS CHRISTIAN DOG! \u0027What - !\u0027 the vicar suspected he\u0027d gone insane. His eyes bulged behind the thick lenses of his spectacles. The others heard nothing except the baby\u0027s crying -which now ceased on the instant. Old man and infant Stared at each other in a deafening silence. \u0027What?\u0027 the Vicar asked again, his voice a whisper. Before his eyes the skin of the baby\u0027s brow puffed up in twin mounds, like huge boils accelerated to instantaneous eruption. The fine skin split and blunt goat horns came through, curving as they emerged. Yulian\u0027s jaws elongated into a dog\u0027s muzzle, which cracked open to reveal a red cave of white knives and a viper\u0027s flickering tongue. The breath of the thing was a stench, an open tomb; its eyes, pits of sulphur, burned on the vicar\u0027s face like fire. \u0027Jesus!\u0027 said the old man. \u0027Oh, my God - what are you?\u0027 And he dropped the child. Or would have - but George had seen the glazing of his eyes, the slackening of his body, the blood\u0027s rapid draining from his face. As the old man crumpled, George stepped forward, took Yulian from him. Anne, also quick off the mark, had caught the old man and managed to lower him a little less than gently to the floor. But Georgina was also reeling. Like the other two, she had seen, smelled, heard nothing - but she was Yulian\u0027s mother. She had felt something coming, and she knew that it had been here. As she, too, fainted, so there came a thunderbolt that struck the steeple, and a cannonade of thunder that rolled on and on. Then there was only silence. And light gradually returning, and dust shaken down in rivulets from rafters high overhead. And George and Anne, white as ghosts, gaping at each other in the church\u0027s lightening gloom. And Yulian, angelic in his godfather\u0027s arms... Georgina was a year making her recovery. Yulian spent the time with his godparents, at the end of which they had their own child to fuss over and care for. His mother spent it in a somewhat select sanatorium. No one was much surprised; her breakdown, so long delayed, had finally arrived with a vengeance. George and Anne, and others of Georgina\u0027s friends, visited her regularly, but no one mentioned the abortive christening or the death of the vicar. That had been a stroke or some such. The old man\u0027s health had been waning. He\u0027d lasted only a few hours after his collapse in the church. George had gone with him in an ambulance to the hospital, had been with him when he died. The old man had come to in the final moments before he passed forever from this world. His eyes had focussed on George\u0027s face, widened, filled with memory, disbelief. \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 George had com-forted him, patting the hand which grasped his forearm with a feverish strength. \u0027Take it easy. You\u0027re in good hands.\u0027 \u0027Good hands? Good hands! My God!\u0027 The old man had been quite lucid. \u0027I dreamed ... I dreamed... there was a christening. You were there.\u0027 It was almost an accusation. George smiled. \u0027There was supposed to be a christening,\u0027 he\u0027d answered. \u0027But don\u0027t worry, you can finish it when you\u0027re up and about again.\u0027 \u0027It was real?\u0027 the old man tried to sit up. \u0027It was real!\u0027 George and a nurse supported him in his bed, lowered him as he collapsed again on to his pillows. Then he caved in. His face contorted and he seemed to crumple into himself. The nurse rushed from the room shouting for a doctor. Still convulsing, the vicar beckoned George closer with a twitching finger. His face was fluttering, had turned the colour of lead. George put his ear to the old man\u0027s whispering lips, heard: \u0027Christen it? No, no - you mustn\u0027t! First - first have it exorcised!\u0027 And those were the last words he ever spoke. George mentioned it to no one. Obviously the old boy\u0027s mind had been going, too. A week after the christening Yulian developed a rash of tiny white blisters on his forehead. They eventually dried up and flaked away, leaving barely visible marks exactly like freckles...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-ii-wamphyri-necroscope-2/page-4.html","bookId":2117,"book":{"id":2117,"title":"Necroscope II: Wamphyri (Necroscope #2)","description":"Storyline: The spirit of Harry Keogh now resides in his son, Harry Jr. When his infant son sleeps, Harry can roam the Continuum and speak to the dead, but is gradually losing his control as the son \"reels\" his father\u0027s spirit back in.
