{"id":92837,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Alec Kyle\u0027s knuckles were white where his hands gripped the rim of his desk. \u0027God in heaven, Harry!\u0027 he cried, staring aghast at the Keogh apparition where bands of soft light flowed through it from the window\u0027s blinds. \u0027Are you trying to scare the shit out of me before we even get started?\u0027 I\u0027m telling it as I know it. That\u0027s what you asked me to do, isn\u0027t it? Keogh was unrepentant. Remember, Alec, you\u0027re getting it secondhand. I got it straight from them, from the dead - the horse\u0027s mouth, as it were - and believe me I\u0027ve watered it down for you! Kyle gulped, shook his head, got a grip of himself. Then something Keogh had said got through to him. \u0027You got it from \"them\"? Suddenly I have this feeling you don\u0027t just mean Thibor Ferenczy and George Lake.\u0027 No, i\u0027ve spoken to the Reverend Pollock, too. From Yulian\u0027s christening? \u0027Oh, yes.\u0027 Kyle wiped his brow. \u0027I see that now. Of course.\u0027 Alec! Keogh\u0027s soft voice was sharper now. We have to hurry. Harry\u0027s beginning to stir. And not only the real child, three hundred and fifty miles away in Hartlepool, but also its ethereal image where it languidly turned, superimposed over and within Keogh\u0027s midriff. It too was stirring, slowly stretching from its foetal position, its baby mouth opening in a yawn. The Keogh manifestation began to waver like smoke, like the heat haze over a summer road. \u0027Before you go!\u0027 Kyle was desperate. \u0027Where do I start?\u0027 He was answered by the faint but very definite wail of a waking infant. Keogh\u0027s eyes opened wide. He tried to take a pace forward, towards Kyle. But the blue shimmer was breaking down, like a television image going wrong. In another moment it snapped into a single vertical line, like a tube of electric blue light, shortened to a point of blinding blue fire at eye-level - and blinked out. But coming to Kyle as from a million miles away: Get in touch with Krakovitch. Tell him what you know. Some of it, anyway. You\u0027re going to need his help. \u0027The Russians? But Harry - , Goodbye, Alec. I\u0027ll get... back... to... you. And the room was completely still, felt somehow empty. The central heating made a loud click as it switched itself off. Kyle sat there a long time, sweating a little, breathing deeply. Then he noticed the lights blinking on his desk communications, heard the gentle, almost timid rapping on his office door. \u0027Alec?\u0027 a voice queried from outside. It was Carl Quint\u0027s voice. \u0027It...t\u0027s gone now. But I suppose you know that. Are you all right in there?\u0027 Kyle took a deep breath, pressed the command button. \u0027It\u0027s finished for now,\u0027 he told the breathless, waiting HQ. \u0027You\u0027d all better come in and see me. There\u0027s time for an \u0027O\u0027-group before we knock it on the head for the day. There\u0027ll be things you\u0027re wanting to know, and things we have to talk about.\u0027 He released the button, said to himself: \u0027And I do mean \"things\".\u0027 The Russian response was immediate, faster than Kyle might ever have believed. He didn\u0027t know that Leonid Brezhnev would soon be wanting all the answers, and that Felix Krakovitch had only four months left of his year\u0027s borrowed time. They were to meet on the first Friday in September, these two heads of ESPionage, on neutral ground. The venue was Genoa, Italy, a seedy bar called Frankie\u0027s Franchise lost in a labyrinth of alleys down in the guts of the city, less than two hundred yards from the waterfront. Kyle and Quint got into Genoa\u0027s surprisingly ramshackle Christopher Columbus airport on Thursday eve-fling; their minder from British Intelligence (whom they hadn\u0027t met and probably wouldn\u0027t) was there twelve hours earlier. They\u0027d made no reservations but had no problems getting adjoining rooms at the Hotel Genovese, where they freshened up and had a meal before retiring to the bar. The bar was quiet, almost subdued, where half-a-dozen Italians, two German businessmen, and an American tourist and his wife sat at small tables or at the bar with their drinks. One of the Italians who sat apart, on his own, wasn\u0027t Italian at all; he was Russian, KGB, but Kyle and Quint had no way of knowing that. He had no ESP talent or Quint would have spotted him at once. They didn\u0027t spot him taking photographs of them with a tiny camera, either. But the Russian had not gone entirely undetected. Earlier he\u0027d been seen entering the hotel and booking a room. Kyle and Quint were in a corner of the bar, on their third Vecchia Romagnas, and talking in lowered tones about their business with Krakovitch tomorrow, when the bar telephone tinkled. \u0027For me!\u0027 Kyle said at once, starting upright on his barstool. His talent always had that effect on him: it startled him like a mild electric shock. The bartender answered the phone, looked up. \u0027Signor - \u0027he began. \u0027Kyle?\u0027 said Kyle, holding out his hand. The bartender smiled, nodded, handed him the phone. \u0027Kyle?\u0027 he said again into the mouthpiece. \u0027Brown here,\u0027 said a soft voice. \u0027Mr Kyle, try not to act surprised or anything, and don\u0027t look up or go all furtive. One of the people in the bar with you is a Russian. I won\u0027t describe him because then you\u0027d act differently and he\u0027d notice it. But I\u0027ve been on to London and put him through our computer. He\u0027s dressed Eyetie but he\u0027s definitely KGB, name of Theo Dolgikh. He\u0027s a top field agent for Andropov. Just thought you\u0027d like to know. There wasn\u0027t supposed to be any of this stuff, was there?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Kyle, \u0027there wasn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Tut-tut!\u0027 said Brown. \u0027I should be a bit sharp with your man when you meet him tomorrow, if I were you. It really isn\u0027t good enough. And just for your peace of mind, if anything were to happen to you - which I consider unlikely - be sure Dolgikh\u0027s a goner too, OK?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s very reassuring,\u0027 said Kyle grimly. He gave the phone back to the barman. \u0027Problems?\u0027 Quint raised an eyebrow. \u0027Finish your drink and we\u0027ll talk about it in our rooms,\u0027 said Kyle \u0027Just act naturally. I think we\u0027re on Candid Camera.\u0027 He forced a smile, swallowed his brandy at a gulp, stood up. Quint followed suit; they left the bar unhurriedly and went up to their rooms; in Kyle\u0027s room they checked for electronic bugs. This was as much a job for their psychic sensitivity as for their five mundane senses, but the room was clean. Kyle told Quint about the call in the bar. Quint was an extremely wiry man of about thirty-five, prematurely balding, soft-spoken but often aggressive, and very quick thinking. \u0027Not a very auspicious start,\u0027 he growled. \u0027Still, I suppose we should have expected it. This is what your common-or-garden secret agent comes up against all the time, I\u0027m told.\u0027 \u0027Well, it\u0027s not on!\u0027 Kyle was angry. \u0027This was supposed to be a meeting of minds, not muscle.\u0027 \u0027Do you know which one of them it was?\u0027 Quint was practical about it. \u0027I think I can remember all of their faces. I\u0027d know any one of them again if we should bump into him.\u0027 \u0027Forget it,\u0027 said Kyle. \u0027Brown doesn\u0027t want a confrontation. He\u0027s geared to get nasty, though, if things go wrong for us.\u0027 \u0027Charmed, I\u0027m sure!\u0027 said Quint. \u0027My reaction exactly,\u0027 Kyle agreed. Then they checked Quint\u0027s room for bugs and, finding nothing, called it a day. Kyle took a shower, got into bed. It was uncomfortably warm so he pushed his blankets on to the floor. The air was humid, oppressive. It felt like rain, and if a storm blew up it would probably be a dandy. Kyle knew Genoa in the autumn, also knew that it has some of the worst storms imaginable. He left his bedside light burning, settled down to sleep. A door, unlocked, stood between the two rooms. Quint was right next door, probably asleep by now. The city\u0027s traffic was giving it hell out beyond the louvered window shutters. London was a tomb by comparison. Tombs hardly seemed a fitting subject to go to sleep on, but . Kyle closed his eyes; he felt sleep pulling him down, soft as a woman\u0027s arms; and he felt - - something else pulling him awake! His lamp was still on, its shade forming a pool of yellow light on the mahogany bedside table. But there was now a second source of illumination, and it was blue! Kyle snatched himself back from sleep, sat bolt upright in his bed. It was Harry Keogh, of course. Carl Quint came bounding through the joining door, dressed only in his pyjama bottoms. He pulled up short, backed off a pace. \u0027Oh my God!\u0027 he said, his mouth hanging open. The Keogh apparition - man, sleeping child and all - turned through ninety degrees to face him. Don\u0027t be alarmed, said Keogh. \u0027Can you see him?\u0027 Kyle wasn\u0027t quite awake yet. \u0027Lord, yes,\u0027 Quint breathed, nodding. \u0027And hear him, too. But even if I couldn\u0027t, I\u0027d still know he was here.\u0027 A psychic sensitive, said Keogh. Well, that helps. Kyle swung his legs out of bed, switched off the lamp. Keogh stood out so much better in the darkness, like a hologram of infinitely fine neon wires. \u0027Carl Quint,\u0027 Kyle said, his skin prickling with the sheer weirdness of this thing he\u0027d never get used to, \u0027meet Harry Keogh.\u0027 Quint stumblingly found a chair close to Kyle\u0027s bed and flopped into it. Kyle was wide awake now, fully in control. He realised how insubstantial it must sound, how hollow and commonplace when he asked: \u0027Harry, what are you doing here?\u0027 And Quint almost laughed, however hysterically, when the apparition answered: I\u0027ve. been talking to Thibor Ferenczy, using my time to my best advantage - for there\u0027s precious little of it to waste. Every waking hour makes Harry jar stronger and me less able to resist him. It\u0027s his body and I\u0027m being subsumed, even absorbed. His little brain is filling up with its own stuff, squeezing me out or maybe compacting me. Pretty soon I\u0027ll have to leave him, and then I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll ever be corporeal again. So on the way back from Thibor, I thought I\u0027d drop in on you. Kyle could almost feel Quint\u0027s near-hysteria; he glanced warningly at him in the light of the soft blue glow. \u0027You\u0027ve been talking to the old Thing in the ground?\u0027 he repeated. \u0027But why, Harry? What is it you want from him?\u0027 He\u0027s one of them, a vampire, or he was. The dead aren\u0027t much bothered with him. He\u0027s a pariah among the dead. In me he has, well, if not a friend, at least someone to talk to. So we trade: I converse with him, and he tells me things I want to know. But nothing\u0027s easy with Thibor Ferenczy. Even dead he has a devious mind. He knows that the longer he strings it out, the sooner I\u0027ll be back. He used the same tactics with Dragosani, remember? \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 Kyle nodded. \u0027And I also remember what happened to Dragosani. You should be careful, Harry.\u0027 Thibor\u0027s dead, Alec, Keogh reminded him. He can do no more harm. But what he left behind might. \u0027What he left behind? You mean Yulian Bodescu? I\u0027ve got men watching the place in Devon until I\u0027m ready for him. When we\u0027re sure of his patterns, when we\u0027ve assessed everything you\u0027ve told us, then we\u0027ll move in.\u0027 I didn\u0027t exactly mean Yulian, though certainly he\u0027s part of it. But are you telling me you\u0027ve put espers on the job? Keogh seemed alarmed. Do they know what they might have to deal with if they\u0027re marked? Are they fully in the picture? \u0027Yes they are. Fully. And they\u0027re equipped. But if we can we\u0027ll learn a little more about them before we act. For all that you\u0027ve told us, still we know so very little.\u0027 And do you know about George Lake? Kyle felt his scalp tingle. Quint, too. And this time it was Quint who answered. \u0027We know he\u0027s no longer in his grave in the cemetery in Blagdon, if that\u0027s what you mean. The doctors diagnosed a heart attack, and his wife and the Bodescus were there at his burial. So much we\u0027ve checked out. But we\u0027ve also been there and had a look for ourselves, and George Lake wasn\u0027t where he should be. We figure he\u0027s back at the house with the others.\u0027 The Keogh manifestation nodded. That\u0027s what I meant. So now he\u0027s undead. And that will have told Yulian Bodescu exactly what he is! Or maybe not exactly. But by now he must be pretty sure he\u0027s a vampire. In fact, he\u0027s only a half-vampire. George, on the other hand - he\u0027s the real thing! He has been dead, so what\u0027s in him will have taken complete control. \u0027What?\u0027 Kyle was bemused. \u0027I don\u0027t - , Let me tell you the rest of Thibor\u0027s story, Keogh cut in. See what you make of that. Kyle could only nod his agreement. \u0027I suppose you know what you\u0027re doing, Harry.\u0027 The room was already colder. Kyle gave a blanket to Quint, wrapped another about himself. \u0027OK, Harry,\u0027 he said. \u0027The stage is all yours. . The last thing Thibor remembered seeing was the Ferenczy\u0027s bestial animal face, his jaws open in a gaping laugh, displaying a crimson forked tongue shuddering like a speared snake in its alien passion. He remembered that, and the fact that he\u0027d been drugged. Then he\u0027d gone down in an irresistible whirlpool, down, down to black lightness depths from which his resurgence had been slow and fraught with nightmares. He had dreamed of yellow-eyed wolves; of a blasphemous banner device in the form of a devil\u0027s head, with its forked tongue much like the Ferenczy\u0027s own, except that on the banner it had dripped gouts of blood; of a black castle built over a mountain gorge, and of its master, who was something other than human. And now, because he knew that he had dreamed, he also knew he must be waking up. And the thought came to him: how much was dream and how much reality? Thibor felt a subterranean cold, cramps in all his limbs, a throbbing in his temples like a reverberating gong in some great sounding cavern. He felt the manacles on his wrists and ankles, the cold slimy stone at his back where he slumped, the drip of seeping moisture from somewhere overhead, where it hissed past his ear and splashed in the hollow of his collar-bone. Chained naked in some black vault in the castle of the Ferenczy. And no need now to ask how much of it had been dream. All of it was real. Thibor came snarling to life, strained with a giant\u0027s strength against the chains that held him powerless, ignored the thunder in his head and the lancing pains in his limbs and body to roar in the darkness like a wounded bull. \u0027Ferenczy! You dog, Ferenczy! Treacherous, misshapen, misbegotten - \u0027 The Wallach warlord stopped shouting, listened to the echoes of his curses dying away. And to something else. From somewhere up above he had heard his bellowing answered by the slam of a door, heard unhurried footsteps descending towards him. And with his cold skin prickling and his nostrils flaring - from rage and terror both - he hung in his chains and waited. The darkness was very nearly utter, streaks of nitre alone glowed with a chemical phosphorescence on the walls; but as Thibor held his breath and the hollow footsteps came closer, so too came a flickering illumination. It issued in an unevenly penetrating yellow glow from an arched stone doorway in what must otherwise be a solid wall of rock; and while Thibor watched with bated breath, so the shadows of his cell were thrown back more yet as the light grew stronger and the footsteps louder. Then a sputtering lantern was thrust in through the archway, and behind it was the Ferenczy himself, crouching a little to avoid the wedge of the keystone. Behind the lantern his eyes were red fires in the shadows of his face. He held the lantern high, nodded grimly at what he saw. Thibor had thought he was alone but now he saw that he was not. In the flare of yellow lamplight he discovered that there were others here with him. But dead or alive...? One of them seemed alive, at least. Thibor narrowed his eyes as the glare from the Ferenczy\u0027s lantern brightened, lighting up the entire dungeon. Three other prisoners were with him here, yes, and dead or alive it wasn\u0027t hard to guess who they\u0027d be. As to how or why the castle\u0027s master had brought them here - that was anybody\u0027s guess. They were of course Thibor\u0027s Wallach companions, and also old Arvos of the Szgany. Of the three, it seemed to be the stumpy Wallach who\u0027d survived: the one who was all chest and arms. He lay crumpled on the floor where stone flags had been laid aside to reveal black soil underneath. His body seemed badly broken, but still his barrel chest rose and fell with some regularity and one of his arms twitched a little. \u0027The lucky one,\u0027 said the Ferenczy, his voice deep as a pit. \u0027Or perhaps unlucky, depending on one\u0027s point of view. He was alive when my children took me to him.\u0027 Thibor rattled his chains. \u0027Was? Man, he\u0027s alive now! Can\u0027t you see him moving? See, he breathes!\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes!\u0027 the Ferenczy moved closer, in that soundless, sinuous way of his. \u0027And the blood surges in his veins, and the brain in his broken head functions and thinks frightened thoughts - but I tell you he is not alive. Nor is he truly dead. He is undead!\u0027 He chuckled as at some obscene joke. \u0027Alive, undead? Is there a difference?\u0027 Thibor yanked viciously on his chains. How he would love to wrap them round the other\u0027s neck and squeeze till his eyes popped out. \u0027The difference is immortality.\u0027 His tormentor thrust his face closer yet. \u0027Alive he was. mortal, undead he \"lives\" forever. Or until he destroys himself, or some accident does the job for him. Ah, but to live forever, eh, Thibor the Wallach? How sweet is life, eh? But would you believe it can be boring, too? No, of course not, for you have not known the ennui of the centuries. Women? I have had such women! And food?\u0027 His voice took on a slyness. \u0027Ah! Gobbets you\u0027ve not yet dreamed of. And yet for these last hundred - nay, two hundred - years, all of these things have bored me.\u0027 \u0027Bored with life, are you?\u0027 Thibor ground his teeth, put every last effort into wrenching his chains\u0027 staples from the sweating stone. It was useless. \u0027Only set me free and I\u0027ll put an end to your - uh! - boredom.\u0027 The Ferenczy laughed like a baying hound. \u0027You will? But you already have, my son. By coming here. For, you see, I have waited for one just such as you. Bored? Aye, that I have been. And indeed you are the cure, but it\u0027s a cure we\u0027ll apply my way. You\u0027d slay me, eh? Do you really think so? Oh, I\u0027ve my share of fighting to come, but not with you. What? I should fight with my own son? Never! No, I\u0027ll go forth and fight and kill like none before me! And I\u0027ll lust and love like twenty men, and none shall say me nay! And I\u0027ll do it all to the ends of the earth, to such excess that my name shall live forever, or be stricken forever from man\u0027s history! For what else can I do with passions such as mine, a creature such as I am, condemned to life?\u0027 \u0027You speak in riddles,\u0027 Thibor spat on the floor. \u0027You\u0027re a madman, crazed by your lonely life up here with nothing but wolves for company. I can\u0027t see why the VIad fears you, one madman on his own. But I can see why he\u0027d want you dead. You are... loathsome! A blemish on mankind. Misshapen, split-tongued, insane: death\u0027s the best thing for you. Or locked up where natural men won\u0027t have to look at you!\u0027 The Ferenczy drew back a little, almost as if he were surprised at Thibor\u0027s vehemence. He hung his lantern from a bracket, seated himself on a stone bench. \u0027Natural men, did you say? Do you talk to me of nature? Ah, but there\u0027s more in nature than meets the eye, my son! Indeed there is. And you think that I\u0027m unnatural, eh? Well, the Wamphyri are rare, be sure, but so is the sabre-tooth. Why, I haven\u0027t seen a mountain cat with teeth like scythes in... three hundred years! Perhaps they are no more. Perhaps men have hunted them down to the last. Aye, and it may be that one day the Wamphyri shall be no more. But if that day should ever come, believe me it shall not be the fault of Faethor Ferenczy. No, and it shall not be yours.\u0027 \u0027More riddles - meaningless mouthings - madness!\u0027 Thibor spat the words out. He was helpless and he knew it. If this monstrous being wished him dead, then he was as good as dead. And it was no use to reason with a madman. Where is the reason in a madman? Better to insult him face to face, enrage him and get it over with. It would be no pleasant thing to hang here and rot, and watch maggots crawling in the flesh of men he\u0027d called his comrades. \u0027Are you finished?\u0027 the Ferenczy asked in his deepest voice. \u0027Best to be done now with all hurtful ranting, for I\u0027ve much to tell you, much to show you, great knowledge and even greater skills to impart. I\u0027m weary of this place, you see, but it needs a keeper. When I go out into the world, someone must stay here to keep this place for me. Someone strong as I myself. It is my place and these are my mountains, my lands. One day I may wish to return. When I do, then I shall find a Ferenczy here. Which is why I call you my son. Here and now I adopt you, Thibor of Wallachia. Henceforth you are Thibor Ferenczy. I give you my name, and I give you my banner: the devil\u0027s head! Oh, I know these honours tower above you; I know you do not yet have my strength. But I shall give it to you! I shall bestow upon you the greatest honour, a magnificent mystery. And when you are become Wamphyri, then - \u0027 \u0027Your name?\u0027 Thibor growled. \u0027I don\u0027t want your name. I spit on your name!\u0027 He shook his head wildly. \u0027As for your device: I\u0027ve a banner of my own.\u0027 \u0027Ah?\u0027 the creature stood up, flowed closer. \u0027And what are your signs?\u0027 \u0027A bat of the Wallachian plain,\u0027 Thibor answered, \u0027astride the Christian dragon.\u0027 The Ferenczy\u0027s bottom jaw fell open. \u0027But that is most propitious. A bat, you say? Excellent! And riding the dragon of the Christians? Better still! And now a third device: let Shaitan himself surmount both.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t need your blood-spewing devil.\u0027 Thibor shook his head and scowled. The Ferenczy smiled a slow, sinister smile. \u0027Oh, but you will, you will.\u0027 Then he laughed out loud. \u0027Aye, and I shall avail myself of your symbols. When I go out across the world I shall fly devil, bat, and dragon all three. There, see how I honour you! Henceforth we carry the same banner.\u0027 Thibor narrowed his eyes. \u0027Faethor Ferenczy, you play with me as a cat plays with a mouse. Why? You call me your son, offer me your name, your sigils. Yet here I hang in chains, with one friend dead and another dying at my feet. Say it now, you are a madman and I\u0027m your next victim. Isn\u0027t it so?\u0027 The other shook his wolfish head. \u0027So little faith,\u0027 he rumbled, almost sadly. \u0027But we shall see, we shall see. Now tell me, what do you know of the Wamphyri?\u0027 \u0027Nothing. Or very little. A legend, a myth. Freakish men who hide in remote places and spring out on peasants and small children to frighten them. Occasionally dangerous: murderers, vampires, who suck blood in the night and swear it gives them strength. \"Viesczy\", to the Russian peasant; \"Obour\", to the Bulgar; \"Vrykoulakas\" in Greek-land. They are names which demented men attach to themselves. But there is something common to them in all tongues: they are liars and madmen!\u0027 \u0027You do not believe? You have looked upon me, seen the wolves which I command, the terror I excite in the hearts of the VIad and his priests, but you do not believe.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve said it before and I\u0027ll say it again,\u0027 Thibor gave his chains a last, frustrated jerk. \u0027The men I\u0027ve killed have all stayed dead! No, I do not believe.\u0027 The other gazed at his prisoner with burning eyes. \u0027That is the difference between us,\u0027 he said. \u0027For the men I kill, if it pleases me to kill them in a certain way, do not stay dead. They become undead...\u0027 He stood up, stepped flowingly close. His upper lip curled back at one side, displayed a downward curving fang like a needle-sharp tusk. Thibor looked away, avoided the man\u0027s breath, which was like poison. And suddenly the Wallach felt weak, hungry, thirsty. He was sure he could sleep for a week. \u0027How long have I been here?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Four days.\u0027 The Ferenczy began to pace to and fro. \u0027Four nights gone you climbed the narrow way. Your friends were unfortunate, you remember? I fed you, gave you wine; alas, you found my wine a little strong! Then, while you, er, rested, my familiar creatures took me to the fallen ones where they lay. Faithful old Arvos, he was dead. Likewise your scrawny Wallach comrade, broken by sharp boulders. My children wanted them for themselves, but I had another use for them and so had them dragged here. This one - , he nudged the blocky Wallach with a booted foot \u0027 - he lived. He had fallen on Arvos! He was a little broken, but alive. I could see he wouldn\u0027t last till morning, and I needed him, if only to prove a point. And so, like the \"myth\", the \"legend\", I fed upon him. I drank from him, and in return gave him something back; I took of his blood, and gave a little of mine. He died. Three days and nights are passed by; that which I gave him worked in him and a certain joining has occurred. Also, a healing. His broken parts are being mended. He will soon rise up as one of the Wamphyri, to be counted in the narrow ranks of The Elite, but ever in thrall to me! He is undead.\u0027 The Ferenczy paused. \u0027Madman!\u0027 Thibor accused again, but with something less of conviction. For the Ferenczy had spoken of these nightmares so easily, with no obvious effort at contrivance. He could not be what he claimed to be - no, of course not - but certainly he might believe that he was. The Ferenczy, if he heard Thibor\u0027s renewed accusation of madness, ignored or refused to acknowledge it. \"Unnatural\", you called me,\u0027 he said. \u0027Which is to claim that you yourself know something of nature. Am I correct? Do you understand life, the \"nature\" of living, growing things?\u0027 \u0027My fathers were farmers, aye,\u0027 Thibor grunted. \u0027I\u0027ve seen things grow.\u0027 \u0027Good! Then you\u0027ll know that there are certain principles, and that sometimes they seem illogical. Now let me test you. How say you: if a man has a tree of favourite apples, and he fears the tree might die, how may he reproduce it and retain the flavour of the fruit?\u0027 \u0027Riddles?\u0027 \u0027Indulge me, pray.\u0027 Thibor shrugged. \u0027Two ways: by seed and by cutting. Plant an apple, and it will grow into a tree.. But for the true, original taste, take cuttings and nurture them. It is obvious: what are cuttings but continuations of the old tree?\u0027 \u0027Obvious?\u0027 the Ferenczy raised his eyebrows. \u0027To you, perhaps. But it would seem obvious to me - and to most men who are not farmers - that the seed should give the true taste. For what is the seed but the egg of the tree, eh? Still, you are of course correct, the cutting gives the true taste. As for a tree grown from seed: why, it is spawned of the pollens of trees other than the original! How then may its fruit be the same? \"Obvious\" - to a tree-grower.\u0027 \u0027Where does all this lead?\u0027 Thibor was surer than ever of the Ferenczy\u0027s madness. \u0027In the Wamphyri,\u0027 the castle\u0027s master gazed full upon him, \u0027 \"nature\" requires no outside intervention, no foreign pollens. Even the trees require a mate with which to reproduce, but the Wamphyri do not. All we require is a host.\u0027 \u0027Host?\u0027 Thibor frowned, felt a sudden tremor in his great legs - the dampness of the walls, stiffening more cramps into his limbs. \u0027Now tell me,\u0027 Faethor went on, \u0027what do you know of fishing?\u0027 \u0027Eh? Fishing? I was a farmer\u0027s son, and now I\u0027m a warrior. What would I know of fishing?\u0027 Faethor continued without answering him: \u0027In the Bulgars and in Turkey-land, fishermen fished in the Greek Sea. For years without number they suffered a plague of starfish, in such quantities that they ruined the fishing and their great weight broke the nets. And the policy of the fishermen was this: they would cut up and kill any starfish they hauled in, and hurl it back to feed the fish. Alas, the true fish does not eat starfish! And worse, from every piece of starfish, a new one grows complete! And \"naturally\", every year there were more. Then some wise fisherman divined the truth, and they began to keep their unwanted catches, bringing them ashore, burning them and scattering their ashes in the olive groves. Lo and behold, the plague dwindled away, the fish came back, the olives grew black and juicy.\u0027 A nervous tic jumped in Thibor\u0027s shoulder: the strain of hanging so long in chains, of course. \u0027Now you tell me,\u0027 he answered, \u0027what starfish have to do with you and I?\u0027 \u0027With you, nothing, not yet. But with the Wamphyri why, \"nature\" has granted us the same boon! How may you cut down an enemy if each lopped portion sprouts a new body, eh?\u0027 Faethor grinned through the yellow bone mesh of his teeth. \u0027And how may any mere man kill a vampire? Now see why I like you so well, my son. For who but a hero would come up here to destroy the indestructible?\u0027 In the eye of Thibor\u0027s memory, he heard again the words of a certain contact in the Kievan Vlad\u0027s court: They put stakes through their hearts and cut off their heads... better still, they break them up entirely and burn all the pieces...ven a small part of a vampire may grow whole again in the body of an unwary man... like a leech, but on the inside! \u0027In the bed of the forest,\u0027 Faethor broke into his morbid thoughts, \u0027grow many vines. They seek the light, and climb great trees to reach the fresh, free air. Some \"foolish\" vines, as it were, may even grow so thickly as to kill their trees and bring them crashing down; and so destroy themselves. You\u0027ve seen that, I\u0027m sure. But others simply use the great trunks of their hosts; they share the earth and the air and the light between them; they live out their lives together. Indeed some vines are beneficial to their host trees. Ah! But then comes the drought. The trees wither, blacken, crumble, and the forest is no more. But down in the fertile earth the vines live on, waiting. Aye, and when more trees grow in fifty, an hundred years, back come the vines to climb again towards the light. Who is the stronger: the tree for his girth and sturdy branches, or the slender, insubstantial vine for his patience? If patience is a virtue, Thibor of Wallachia, then the Wamphyri are virtuous as all the ages . . \u0027Trees, fishes, vines.\u0027 Thibor shook his head. \u0027You rave, Faethor Ferenczy!\u0027 \u0027All of these things I\u0027ve told you,\u0027 the other was undeterred, \u0027you will understand... eventually. But before you can begin to understand, first you must believe in me. In what I am.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll never - \u0027 Thibor began, only to be cut short. \u0027Oh, but you will!\u0027 the Ferenczy hissed, his awful tongue lashing in the cave of his mouth. \u0027Now listen: I have willed my egg. I have brought it on and it is forming even now. Each of the Wamphyri has but one egg, one seed, in a lifetime; one chance to recreate the true fruit; one opportunity to carve his changeling \"nature\" into the living being of another. You are the host I have chosen for my egg.\u0027 \u0027Your egg?\u0027 Thibor wrinkled his nose, scowled, drew back as far as his chains would allow. \u0027Your seed? You are beyond help, Faethor.\u0027 \u0027Alas,\u0027 said the other, lip curling and great nostrils flaring, \u0027but you are the one who is beyond help!\u0027 His cloak billowed as he flowed towards the broken body of old Arvos. He hoisted the gypsy\u0027s corpse upright in one hand, like a bundle. of rags, perched it, head stiffly lolling, in a niche in the stone wall. \u0027We have no sex as such,\u0027 he said, glaring across the cell at Thibor. \u0027Only the sex of our hosts. Ah! But we multiply their zest an hundred times! We have no lust except theirs, which we double and redouble. We may, and do, drive them to excesses - in all of their passions - but we heal their wounds, too, when the excess is too great for human flesh and blood to endure. And with long, long years, even centuries, so man and vampire grow into one creature. They become inseparable, except under extreme duress. I, who was a man, have now reached just such a maturity. So shall you, in perhaps a thousand years.\u0027 Once more, futilely, Thibor tugged at his chains. Impossible to break or even strain them. He could put a thumb through each link! \u0027About the Wamphyri,\u0027 Faethor continued. \u0027Just as there are in the common world widely differing sorts of the same basic creature - owl and gull and sparrow, fox and hound and wolf - so are there varying Wamphyri states and conditions: For example: we talked about taking cuttings from an apple tree. Yes, it might be easier if you think of it that way.\u0027 He stooped, dragged the unconscious, twitching body of the squat Wallach away from the area of torn up flags, tossed old Arvos\u0027 corpse down upon the black soil. Then he tore open the old man\u0027s ragged shirt, and glanced up from where he knelt into Thibor\u0027s mystified eyes. \u0027Is there sufficient light, my son? Can you see?\u0027 \u0027I see a madman clearly enough,\u0027 Thibor gave a brusque nod. The Ferenczy returned his nod, and again he smiled his hideous smile, the ivory of his teeth gleaming in lantern light. \u0027Then see this!\u0027 he hissed. Kneeling beside old Arvos\u0027 crumpled form, he extended a forefinger towards the gypsy\u0027s naked chest. Thibor watched. Faethor\u0027s forearm stuck out free of his robe. Whatever the Ferenczy was up to, there could be no trickery, no sleight of hand here. Faethor\u0027s nails were long and sharply pointed at the end of his even, slender fingers. Thibor saw the quick of the pointing finger turn red and start to drip blood. The pink nail cracked open like the brittle shell of a nut, flapped loosely like a trapdoor on a finger bloating and pulsating. Blue and grey-green veins stood out in that member, writhing under the skin; the raw tip visibly lengthened, extending itself towards the dead gypsy\u0027s cold grey flesh. The pulsating digit was no longer a finger as such: it was a pseudopod of unflesh, a throbbing rod of living matter, a stiff snake shorn of its skin. Now twice, now three times its former length, it vibrated down at an angle to within inches of its target, which appeared to be the dead man\u0027s heart. And all of this Thibor watched with bulging eyes, bated breath and gaping mouth. And until this moment Thibor had not really known fear, but now he did. Thibor the Wallach - warlord of however small and ragged an army, humourless, merciless killer of the Pechenegi - utterly fearless Thibor, until now. Until now he\u0027d not met a creature he feared. In the hunt, wild boar in the forests, which had wounded men so badly as to kill them, were \u0027piglets\u0027 to him. In the challenge: let any man only dare hurl down the gauntlet, Thibor would fight him any way he chose. All knew it, and none chose! And in battle: he led from the front, stood at the head of the charge, could only ever be found in the thick of the fighting. Fear? It was a word without meaning. Fear of what? When he had ridden out to battle, he\u0027d known each day might be his last. That had not deterred him. So black was his hatred of the invaders, of all enemies, that it simply engulfed fear and put it down. No creature, or man, or threat of any device of men had ever unmanned him since... oh, before he could remember: since he was a child, if ever he\u0027d been one. But Faethor Ferenczy was something other than all of these. Torture could only maim and must kill in the end, and there\u0027s no pain after death, but what the Ferenczy threatened seemed an eternity of hell. Mere moments ago it had been a strange fantasy, the dreams of a madman, but now. . Unable to tear his eyes away, Thibor groaned and grew pale at the sight of that which followed. \u0027A cutting, aye,\u0027 Faethor\u0027s voice was low, trembling with dark passions, \u0027to be nurtured in flesh already tainted and falling into decay. The lowest form of Wamphyri existence, it will come to nothing so long as it has no living host. But it will live, devour, grow strong - and hide! When there is nothing left of Arvos it will hide in the earth and wait. Like the vine, waiting for a tree. The cut-off leg of a starfish, which does not die but waits to grow a new body - except this thing I make waits to inhabit one! Mindless, unthinking, it will be a thing of the most primitive instincts. But it can nevertheless outlast the ages. Until some unwary man finds it, and it finds him...\u0027 His incredible, bloody, throbbing forefinger touched Arvos\u0027 flesh... and leprous white rootlets sprang forth, slid like worms in earth into the gypsy\u0027s chest! Small flaps of fretted skin were laid back; the pseudopod developed tiny glistening teeth of its own; it began to gnaw its way inside. Thibor would have looked away but he could not. Faethor\u0027s \u0027finger\u0027 broke off with a soft tearing sound and quickly burrowed its way out of sight within the corpse. Faethor held up his hand. The severed member was shrinking back into him, pseudoflesh melting into his flesh. The cancerous colours went out of it; it assumed a more normal shape; the old fingernail fell to the floor, and right in front of Thibor\u0027s eyes a new, pink shell began to form. \u0027Well then, my hero son who came here to kill me,\u0027 Faethor slowly stood up and held out his hand toward Thibor\u0027s bloodless face. \u0027And could you have killed this?\u0027 Thibor drew back his face, head and body, tried to cringe into the very stone to avoid that pointing finger. But Faethor only laughed. \u0027What? You think that I would... ? But no, no, not you, my son. Oh, I could, be sure! And forever you\u0027d be in thrall to me. But that is the second state of the Wamphyri and unworthy of you. No, for I hold you in the highest esteem. Why, you shall have my very egg!\u0027 Thibor tried to find words but his throat lacked moisture, was dry as a desert. Faethor laughed again and drew back that threatening hand of his. He turned away and stepped to where the squat Wallach lay humped on the stone flags, gurglingly breathing, face down in a dusty corner. \u0027He is in that second state,\u0027 Thibor\u0027s tormentor explained. \u0027I took from him and gave him something back. Flesh of my flesh is in him now, healing him, changing him. His tears and broken bones will mend and he will live - for as long as I will it. But he will always be slave to me, to do my bidding, obey my every command. You see, he is vampire, but without vampire mind. The mind comes only from the egg and he is not grown from seed but is merely... a cutting. When he wakes, which will be soon, then you will understand.\u0027 \u0027Understand?\u0027 Thibor found his voice, however cracked. \u0027But how can I understand? Why should I want to understand? You are a monster, I understand that! Arvos is dead, and yet you... you did that to him! Why? Nothing can live in him now but maggots.\u0027 Faethor shook his head. \u0027No, his flesh is like fertile soil - or the fertile sea. Think of the starfish.\u0027 \u0027You will grow another... another you? Inside him?\u0027 Thibor was very nearly gibbering now. \u0027It will consume him,\u0027 Faethor answered. \u0027But another me - no. I have mind. It will not have mind. Arvos cannot be a host for his mind is dead, do you see? He is food, nothing more. When it grows it will not be like me. Only like... what you saw.\u0027 He held up his pale, newly formed index finger. \u0027And the other?\u0027 Thibor managed to nod in the direction of the man - that which had been a man - snoring and gasping in the corner. - \u0027When I took him he was alive,\u0027 said Faethor. \u0027His mind was alive. What I gave him is now growing in his body, and in his mind. Oh, he died, but only to make way for the life of the Wamphyri. Which is not life but undeath. He will not return to true life but to undeath.\u0027 \u0027Madness!\u0027 Thibor moaned. \u0027As for this one - , The Ferenczy stepped into shadows on the far side of the cell, where the light did not quite reach. The legs and one arm of Thibor\u0027s second Wallach comrade protruded from the darkness, until Faethor dragged all of him into view. \u0027This one will be food for both of them. Until the mindless one hides himself away, and the other takes up his duties as your servant here.\u0027 \u0027My servant?\u0027 Thibor was bewildered. \u0027Here?\u0027 \u0027Do you hear nothing I say?\u0027 Faethor\u0027s turn to scowl. \u0027For more than two hundred years I have cared for myself, protected myself, stayed alone and lonely in a world expanding, changing, full of new wonders. This I have done for my seed, which now is ready to be passed on, passed down, to you. You will stay behind and keep this place, these lands, this \"legend\" of the Ferenczy alive. But I shall go out amongst men and revel! There are wars to be won, honours to be earned, history is in the making. Aye, and there are women to be spoiled!\u0027 \u0027Honours, you?\u0027 Thibor had regained something of his former nerve. \u0027I doubt it. And for a creature \"alone and lonely\", you seem to know a great deal of what is passing in the world.\u0027 Faethor smiled his ghastliest smile. \u0027Another secret art of the Wamphyri,\u0027 he chuckled obscenely in his throat. \u0027One of several. Beguilement is another - which you saw at work between myself and Arvos, binding his mind to mine so that we could talk to each other over great distances - and then there is the art of the necromancer.\u0027 Necromancy! Thibor had heard of that. The eastern barbarians had their magicians, who could open the bellies of dead men to read their lives\u0027 secrets in their smoking guts. \u0027Necromancy,\u0027 Faethor nodded, seeing the look in Thibor\u0027s eyes, \u0027aye. I shall teach it to you soon. It has allowed me to confirm my choice of yourself as a future vessel of the Wamphyri. For who would know better of you and your deeds, your strengths and weaknesses, your travels and adventures, than a former colleague, eh?\u0027 He stooped and effortlessly flopped the body of the thin Wallach over onto its back. And Thibor saw what had been done. No wolf pack had done this, for nothing was eaten. The thin, hunched Wallach - an aggressive man in life, who had always gone with his chin thrust forward - seemed even thinner now. His trunk had been laid open from groin to gullet, with all of his pipes and organs loose and flopping, and the heart in particular hanging by a thread, literally torn out. Thibor\u0027s sword had gutted men as thoroughly as this, and it had meant nothing. But by the Ferenczy\u0027s own account, this man had already been dead. And his enormous wound was not the work of a sword . . Thibor shuddered, turned his eyes away from the mutilated corpse and inadvertently found Faethor\u0027s hands. The monster\u0027s nails were sharp as knives. Worse, (Thibor felt dizzy, even faint,) his teeth were like chisels. \u0027Why?\u0027 The word left Thibor\u0027s lips as a whisper. \u0027I\u0027ve told you why.\u0027 Faethor was growing impatient. \u0027I wanted to know about you. In life he was your friend. You were in his blood, his lungs, his heart. In death he was loyal, too, for he would not give up his secrets easily. See how loose are his innards. Ah! How I teased them, to wrest their secrets from him.\u0027 All the strength went out of Thibor\u0027s legs and he fell in his chains like a man crucified. \u0027If I\u0027m to die, kill me now,\u0027 he gasped. \u0027Have done with this.\u0027 Faethor flowed close, closer, stood not an arm\u0027s length away. \u0027The first state of being - the prime condition of the Wamphyri - does not require death. You may think that you are dying, when first the seed puts out its rootlets into your brain and sends them groping along the marrow of your spine, but you will not die. After that...\u0027 he shrugged. \u0027The transition may be laboriously slow or lightning swift, one can never tell. But of one thing be sure, it will happen.\u0027 Thibor\u0027s blood surged one last time in his veins. He could still die a man. \u0027Then if you\u0027ll not give me a clean death, I\u0027ll give myself one!\u0027 He gritted his teeth and wrenched on his manacles until the blood flowed freely from his wrists; and still he jerked on the irons, deepening his wounds. Faethor\u0027s long drawn-out hisssss stopped him. He looked up from his grisly work of self-destruction into... into the pit, the abyss itself. Hideous face working yet more hideously, features literally writhing in a torment of passion, the Ferenczy was so close as to be the merest breath away. His long jaws opened and a scarlet snake flickered in the darkness behind teeth which had turned to daggers in his mouth. \u0027You dare show me your blood? The hot blood of youth, the blood which is the life?\u0027 His throat convulsed in a sudden spasm and Thibor thought he was going to be ill, but he was not. Instead he clutched at his throat, gurgled chokingly, staggered a little. When he had regained control, he said: \u0027Ah, Thibor! But now, ready or not, you have brought on that which cannot be reversed. It is my time, and yours. The time of the egg, the seed. See! See!\u0027 He opened his great jaws until his mouth was a cavern, and his forked, flickering tongue bent backwards like a hook into his throat. And like a hook it caught something and dragged it into view. Gasping, again Thibor drew down into himself. He saw the vampire seed there in the fork of Faethor\u0027s tongue: a translucent, silver-grey droplet shining like a pearl, trembling in the final seconds before... before its seeding? \u0027No!\u0027 Thibor hoarsely denied the horror. But it would not be denied. He looked in Faethor\u0027s eyes for some hint of what was coming, but that was a terrible mistake. Beguilement and hypnotism were the Ferenczy\u0027s greatest accomplishment. The vampire\u0027s eyes were yellow as gold, huge and growing bigger moment by moment. Ah, my son, those eyes seemed to say, come, a kiss for your father. Then - The pearly droplet turned scarlet, and Faethor\u0027s mouth fastened on Thibor\u0027s own, which stood open in a scream that might last forever . Harry Keogh\u0027s pause had lasted for several seconds, but still Kyle and Quint sat there, wrapped in their blankets and the horror of his story. \u0027That is the most - ,Kyle started. Almost simultaneously, Quint said, \u0027I\u0027ve never in my life heard - , We have to stop there, Keogh broke in on both of them, something of urgency in his telepathic voice. My son is about to be difficult; he\u0027s going to wake up for his feed. \u0027Two minds in one body,\u0027 Quint mused, still awed by what he\u0027d heard. \u0027I mean, I\u0027m talking about you, Harry. In a way you\u0027re not unlike - , Don\u0027t say it. Keogh cut him off a second time. There\u0027s no way I\u0027m like that! Not even remotely. But listen, I have to hurry. Do you have anything to tell me? Kyle got a grip of his rioting thoughts, forced himself back to earth, to the present. \u0027We\u0027re meeting Krakovitch tomorrow,\u0027 he said. \u0027But I\u0027m annoyed. This was supposed to be exclusive, entirely an inter-branch exchange - a bit of ESP d��tente, as it were - but there\u0027s at least one KGB goon in on it too.\u0027 How do you know? \u0027We\u0027ve a minder on the job - but he\u0027s strictly in the background. Their man comes close up.\u0027 The Keogh apparition seemed puzzled. That wouldn\u0027t have happened in Borowitz\u0027s time. He hated them! And frankly, I can\u0027t see it happening now. There\u0027s no meeting ground between Andropov\u0027s sort of mind-control and ours. And when I say \u0027ours\u0027 I include the Russian outfit. Don\u0027t let it develop into a shouting match, Alec. You have to work with Krakovitch. Offer your assistance. Kyle frowned. \u0027To do what?\u0027 He has ground to clear. You know at least one of the sites. You can help him to do it. \u0027Ground to clear?\u0027 Kyle got up off his bed. Hugging his blanket to him, he stepped towards the manifestation. \u0027Harry, we still have our own ground to clear in England! While I\u0027m out here in Italy, Yulian Bodescu is still freewheeling over there! I\u0027m anxious about it. I keep getting this urge to turn my lot loose on him and - \u0027 NO! Keogh was alarmed. Not until we know everything there is to know. You daren\u0027t risk it. Right now he\u0027s at the centre of a very small nest, but if he wanted to he could spread this thing like a plague! Kyle knew he was right. \u0027Very well,\u0027 he said, \u0027but - , Can\u0027t stay, the other broke in. The pull is too strong. He\u0027s waking, gathering his faculties, and he seems to include me as one of them. His neon-etched image began to shimmer, its blue glow pulsing. \u0027Harry, what \"ground\" were you talking about, anyway?\u0027 The old Thing in the ground. Keogh came and went like a distorted radio signal. The hologram child superimposed over his midriff was visibly stirring, stretching. Kyle thought: we\u0027ve had this conversation before! \u0027You said we know at least one of the sites. Sites? You mean Thibor\u0027s tomb? But he\u0027s dead, surely?\u0027 The cruciform hills... starfish... vines... creepers in the earth, hiding. Kyle drew air in a gasp. \u0027He\u0027s still there?\u0027 Keogh nodded, changed his mind and shook his head. He tried to speak; his outline wavered and collapsed; he disappeared in a scattering of brilliant blue motes. For a moment Kyle thought his mind still remained, but it was only Carl Quint whispering: \u0027No, not Thibor. He\u0027s not there. Not him, but what he left behind!\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-ii-wamphyri-necroscope-2/page-6.html","bookId":2117,"book":{"id":2117,"title":"Necroscope II: Wamphyri (Necroscope #2)","description":"Storyline: The spirit of Harry Keogh now resides in his son, Harry Jr. When his infant son sleeps, Harry can roam the Continuum and speak to the dead, but is gradually losing his control as the son \"reels\" his father\u0027s spirit back in.
