{"id":92844,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"When Kyle and his companions got back to lonesti and the inn, they found Irma Dobresti pacing the floor of their suite, nervously massaging her long hands. Her relief when she saw them was obvious. Likewise her delight when they told her the operation had been a complete success. They weren\u0027t eager, however, to detail much of what had happened in the foothills; looking at their drawn faces, she was wise enough not to pry. They might tell her later, in their own time.\n \u0027So,\u0027 she said, after they\u0027d had a drink, \u0027the job is done here. We are not needing to stay any longer in lonesti. It is ten-thirty - late, I know, but I am suggesting we go now. These red tape dolts will arrive soon. Is better if we are not here.\u0027\n \u0027Red tape?\u0027 Quint looked surprised. \u0027I didn\u0027t know you used that term, er, over here!\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 she answered, unsmiling. \u0027Also \"Commie\", and \"Zurich Gnome\", and \"Capitalist dog\"!\u0027\n \u0027I agree with Irma,\u0027 said Kyle. \u0027If we wait we\u0027ll only be obliged to brazen it out - or tell the truth. And the truth, while it is verifiable in the long term, isn\u0027t immediately believable. No, I can see all kinds of problems coming up if we stay here.\u0027\n \u0027All true.\u0027 She nodded, sighing her relief that the Englishman was of a like mind. \u0027Later, if they are determined to talk about this, they can contact me in Bucharest. There I am on my own ground, with the backing of my superiors. I am not for blaming. This was a matter of national security, a liaison of a scientific, preventative nature between three great countries, Romania, Russia, and Great Britain. I am secure. But right now, here in lonesti, I do not feel secure.\u0027\n \u0027So let\u0027s get to it,\u0027 said Quint, with his usual efficiency.\n Irma showed her yellow teeth in one of her infrequent smiles. \u0027No need for getting to it,\u0027 she informed. \u0027Nothing to get to. I took the liberty of packing your bags! Can we go now, please?\u0027\n Without more ado, they paid the bill and left.\n Krakovitch opted to drive, giving Sergei Gulharov a break. As they sped back towards Bucharest on the night roads, Gulharov sat beside Irma in the back of the car and quietly filled her in as best he could on the story of what had happened in the hills, the monstrous thing they had burned there.\n When he was finished she said simply, \u0027Your faces told me it must have been like that. I am glad I not seeing it . .\n After his last painful visit, at about 10.00 P.M., Darcy Clarke had slept like a log in his hotel bedroom for nearly three hours solid. When he woke up he felt fighting fit. All very mysterious; he\u0027d never known an attack of gastro-enteritis to come and go so quickly (not that he was sorry it had gone) and he had no idea what he could have eaten to cause it. Whatever it had been, the rest of the team had felt no ill effects. It was because he didn\u0027t want to let that team down that Clarke dressed quickly and went to report himself fit for duty.\n In the control room (the living area of their main suite of rooms), he found Guy Roberts slumped in his swivel chair, head on his folded arms where he sprawled across his \u0027desk\u0027: a dining table, cluttered with notes, a log book and a telephone. He was fast asleep with an ashtray piled full of dog-ends right under his nose. A tobacco addict, he probably wouldn\u0027t be able to sleep comfortably without it!\n Trevor Jordan snoozed in a deep armchair while Ken Layard and Simon Gower quietly played their own version of Chinese Patience at a small green-baize card table. Gower, a prognosticator or augur of some talent, played badly, making too many mistakes. \u0027Can\u0027t concentrate!\u0027 he growlingly complained. \u0027I have this feeling of bad stuff coming lots of it!\u0027\n \u0027Stop making excuses!\u0027 said Layard. \u0027Hell, we know bad stuff is coming! And we know where from. We don\u0027t know when, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Gower frowned, tossed in his hand, \u0027I mean not of our making. When we go against Harkley and Bodescu, that will be different. This thing I\u0027m feeling is - \u0027 he shrugged uneasily, \u0027something else.\u0027\n \u0027So maybe we should wake up the Fat Man there and tell him?\u0027 Layard suggested.\n Gower shook his head. \u0027I\u0027ve been telling him for the last three days. It isn\u0027t specific it never is - but it\u0027s there. You could be right: I\u0027m probably feeling the ding-dong coming up at Harkley House. If so, then believe me it\u0027s going to be a good one! Anyway, let old Roberts kip. He\u0027s tired and when he\u0027s awake the place stinks of bloody weed! I\u0027ve seen him with three going at once! God, you need a respirator!\u0027\n Clarke stepped round Roberts\u0027s snoring form to-check the roster. Roberts had only mapped it out until the end of the afternoon shift. Keen was on now, to be relieved by Layard, a locator or finder, who in turn would watch Harkley till 8.00 A.M. Then it would be Gower\u0027s turn until 2.00 P.M., followed by Trevor Jordan. The roster went no farther than that. Clarke wondered if that was significant...\n Maybe that was what Gower was feeling: a ding-dong, as he had it, but a little closer than he thought.\n Layard cocked his head on one side, looked at Clarke where he studied the roster. \u0027What\u0027s up, old son? Still got the runs? You can stop worrying about shift work at Harkley. Guy has pulled you off it.\u0027\n Gower looked up and managed a grin. \u0027He doesn\u0027t want you polluting the bushes out there!\u0027\n \u0027Ha-ha!\u0027 said Clarke, his face blank. \u0027Actually, I\u0027m fine now. And I\u0027m starving! Ken, you can go and jump in your bed if you like. I\u0027ll take the next shift. That\u0027ll adjust the roster back to normal.\u0027\n \u0027What a hero!\u0027 Layard gave a soft whistle. \u0027Great! Six hours in bed will suit me just fine.\u0027 He stood up, stretched. \u0027Did you say you were hungry? There are sandwiches under the plate on the table there. A bit curly by now, but still edible.\u0027\n Clarke started to munch on a sandwich, glancing at his watch. It was 1.15 P.M. \u0027I\u0027ll have a quick shower and get on my way. When Roberts wakes up, tell him I\u0027m on, right?\u0027\n Gower stood up, went to Clarke and stared hard at him. \u0027Darcy, is there something on your mind?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Clarke shook his head, then changed his mind. \u0027Yes... I don\u0027t know! I just want to get out to Harkley, that\u0027s all. Do my bit.\u0027\n Twenty-five minutes later he was on his way.\n Shortly before 2.00 A.M. Clarke parked his car on the hard shoulder of the road maybe quarter -of a mile from Harkley House and walked the rest of the way. The mist had thinned out and the night was starting to look fine. Stars lit his way, and the hedgerows had a nimbus of foxfire to sharpen their silhouettes.\n Oddly enough, and for all his terrifying confrontation with Bodescu\u0027s dog, Clarke felt no fear. He put it down to the fact that he carried a loaded gun, and that back there in the boot of his car was a small but quite deadly metal crossbow. After he had seen Peter Keen off duty, he\u0027d bring up his car and park it in Keen\u0027s spot.\n On his way he met no one, but he heard a dog yapping across the fields, and another answering bark for bark, apparently from miles away. A handful of hazy lights shone softly on the hills, and just as he came in sight of Harkley\u0027s gates a distant church clock dutifully gonged out the hour.\n Two o\u0027clock and all\u0027s well, thought Clarke except he saw that it wasn\u0027t. There was no sign of Keen\u0027s unmistakeable red Capri, for one thing. And for another there was no sign of Keen.\n Clarke scratched his head, scuffed the grass where Keen\u0027s car should be parked. The wet grass gave up a broken branch, and... no, it wasn\u0027t a branch. Clarke stooped, picked up the snapped crossbow bolt in fingers that were suddenly tingling. Something was very, very wrong here!\n He looked up, staring at Harkley House standing there like a squat sentient creature in the night. Its eyes were closed now, but what was hiding behind the lowered lids of its dark windows?\n All of Clarke\u0027s senses were operating at maximum efficiency: his ears picked up the rustle of a mouse, his eyes glared to penetrate the darkness, he could taste, almost feel the evil in the night air, and something stank. Literally. The stink of a slaughterhouse.\n Clarke took out a pencil-slim torch and flashed it on the grass which was red and wet and sticky! The cuffs of his trousers were stained a dark crimson with blood. Someone (God, let it not be Peter Keen!) had spilled pints of the stuff right here. Clarke\u0027s legs trembled and he felt faint, but he forced himself to follow a track, a bloody swath, to a spot behind the hedgerow, hidden from the road. And there it was much worse. Did one man have that much blood!\n Clarke wanted to be sick, but that would incapacitate him and right now he dare not be incapacitated. But the grass... it was strewn with clots of blood, shreds of skin and gobbets of... of meat! Human flesh! And under the narrow beam of his torch there was something else, something which might just be God, a kidney!\n Clarke ran - or rather floated, fought, swam, drifted, as in a dream or nightmare back to his car, drove like a madman back to Paignton, hurled himself into INTESP\u0027s suite of rooms. He was in shock, remembered nothing of the drive, nothing at all except what he\u0027d seen, which had seared itself onto his mind. He fell into a chair and lolled there, gasping, trembling: his mouth, face, all of his limbs, even his mind, trembling.\n Guy Roberts had come half-awake when Clarke rushed in. He saw him, the state of his trousers, the dead white slackness of his face, and was fully alert in an instant. He dragged Clarke to his feet and slapped him twice, ringing blows that brought the colour back to Clarke\u0027s cheeks - and blood to his previously blank eyes. Clarke drew himself up and glared; he growled and showed his gritted teeth, went for Roberts like a madman.\n Trevor Jordan and Simon Gower dragged him off Roberts, held him tight and at last be broke down. Sobbing like a child, finally he told the whole story. The only thing he didn\u0027t tell was the one which must be perfectly obvious: why it had affected him so very badly.\n \u0027Obvious, yes,\u0027 said Roberts to the others, cradling Clarke\u0027s head and rocking him like a child. \u0027You know what Darcy\u0027s talent is, don\u0027t you? That\u0027s right: he has this thing that looks after him. What? He could walk through a minefield and come out unscathed! So you see, Darcy\u0027s blaming himself for what happened. He had the shits tonight and couldn\u0027t go on duty. But it wasn\u0027t anything he ate that queered his guts it was his damned talent! Or else it would be Darcy himself minced out there and not Peter Keen. .\n Tuesday, 6.00 A.M.: Alex Kyle was shaken rudely awake by Carl Quint. Krakovitch was with Quint, both of them hollow-eyed through travel and lack of sleep. They had stayed overnight at the Dunarea, where they\u0027d checked in just before 1.00 A.M. They had had maybe four hours\u0027 sleep; Krakovitch had been roused by night staff to answer a call from England on behalf of his English guests; Quint, knowing by means of his talent that something was in the air, had been awake anyway.\n \u0027I\u0027ve had the call transferred to my room,\u0027 said Krakovitch to Kyle, who was still gathering his senses. \u0027It is someone called Roberts. He is wishing to speak to you. Most important.\u0027\n Kyle shook himself awake, glanced at Quint.\n \u0027Something\u0027s up,\u0027 Quint said. \u0027I\u0027ve suspected it for a couple of hours. I tossed and turned, sleep all broken up but too tired to respond properly.\u0027\n All three in pyjamas, they went quickly to Krakovitch\u0027s room. On the way the Russian inquired, \u0027How do they know where you are, your people? It is them, yes? I\n mean, we had not planned to be here tonight.\u0027\n Quint raised an eyebrow in his fashion. \u0027We\u0027re in the same business as you, Felix, remember?\u0027\n Krakovitch was impressed. \u0027A finder? Very accurate!\u0027\n Quint didn\u0027t bother to put him right. Ken Layard was good, all right, but not that good. The better he knew a person or thing the easier he could find him or it. He\u0027d have located Kyle in Bucharest; they\u0027d have systematically checked out the major hotels. Since the Dunarea was one of the biggest, it must have come up high on the list.\n In Krakovitch\u0027s room Kyle took the call. \u0027Guy? Alec here.\u0027\n \u0027Alec? We have a big problem. It\u0027s bad, I\u0027m afraid. Can we talk?\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t it go through London?\u0027 Kyle was fully awake now.\n \u0027That\u0027ll take time,\u0027 Roberts answered, \u0027and time\u0027s important.\u0027\n \u0027Wait,\u0027 said Kyle. He said to Krakovitch: \u0027What are the odds this is being monitored?\u0027\n The Russian shrugged, shook his head. \u0027None at all, that I can see.\u0027 He stepped to the window, opened the curtains. It would soon be dawn.\n \u0027OK, Guy,\u0027 Kyle spoke into the phone. \u0027Let\u0027s have it.\u0027\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Roberts. \u0027It\u0027s just about four A.M. here. Now go back two hours...\u0027 He told Kyle the entire story, then detailed the action he\u0027d taken since Clarke\u0027s hag-ridden drive back to the hotel in Paignton.\n \u0027I got Ken Layard in on it. He was great. He fixed Keen\u0027s location somewhere on the road between Brixham and Newton Abbot. Keen and his car, smashed up, burned out. I scried out Layard\u0027s fix and he was right, of course; we were able to say quite definitely that Peter was that he was dead.\n \u0027I contacted the police in Paignton, told them I was waiting for a friend who was a little overdue, gave them his name, description, a description of his car. They said there\u0027d been an accident; he was being cut out of the car; they could tell me no more, but an ambulance was on the scene and the driver of the car would be taken to the emergency hospital in Torquay. For me that was a ten minute drive. I was there when he was brought in. I identified him...\u0027 He paused.\n \u0027Go on,\u0027 said Kyle, knowing there must be worse to come.\n \u0027Alec, I feel responsible. We should have been tighter. The trouble with this game is that we rely on our talents too damned much! We\u0027ve almost forgotten how to use simple technology. We should have had walkie-talkies, better contact. We should have given this damned monster more credit for mayhem! I mean, Christ, how could I let this happen? We\u0027re espers; we have special talents; Bodescu is only one man and we\u0027re - \u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s not just a man!\u0027 Kyle snapped. \u0027And we don\u0027t have a monopoly on talent. He has it, too. It\u0027s not your fault. Now please tell me the rest of it.\u0027\n \u0027He... Peter was... hell, he didn\u0027t get those injuries in any car smash! He\u0027d been opened up... gutted! Everything was exposed. His head was... God, it was in two halves!\u0027\n Despite the horror conjured by Roberts\u0027s description, Kyle tried to think dispassionately. He\u0027d known Peter Keen well and liked him. But now he must put that aside and think only of the job. \u0027Why the car smash? What did that bastard hope to get out of it?\u0027\n \u0027The way I see it,\u0027 Roberts answered, \u0027he was just covering up the murder, and what he\u0027d done to Peter\u0027s poor body. The police said there was a strong petrol smell all around and inside the car. I reckon Bodescu drove Peter out there, put the car in top gear, pointed it downhiIl and let it roll. Being what he is, a few grazes and cuts wouldn\u0027t matter much when he jumped for it. And he probably splashed a lot of petrol around inside the car first, so as to bum the evidence. But the way he\u0027d cut that poor lad up was... Jesus, it was horrible! I mean, why? Peter must have been dead long before that ghoul was finished. If he was torturing him at least there\u0027d be some sense in it. I mean, however horrible, at least I could understand it. But you can\u0027t learn anything from a dead man, now can you?\u0027\n Kyle almost dropped the telephone. \u0027Oh, my God!\u0027 he whispered.\n \u0027Eh?\u0027\n Kyle said nothing, stood frozen in sudden shock.\n \u0027Alec?\u0027\n \u0027Yes you can,\u0027 Kyle finally answered. \u0027You can learn an awful lot from a dead man - everything, in fact if you\u0027re a necromancer!\u0027\n Roberts had had access to the Keogh file. Now it all came back to mind and he saw Kyle\u0027s meaning. \u0027You mean like Dragosani?\u0027\n \u0027I mean exactly like Dragosani!\u0027\n Quint had caught most of this. \u0027Good Lord!\u0027 He grabbed Kyle\u0027s elbow. \u0027He knows all about us. He knows - \u0027\n \u0027Everything!\u0027 Kyle said, to Quint and to Roberts. \u0027He knows the lot. He dragged it out of Keen\u0027s guts, out of his brains, his blood, his poor violated organs! Guy, now listen, this is important. Did Keen know when you plan to move in on Harkley House?\u0027\n \u0027No. I\u0027m the only one who knows that. Those were your instructions.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. Good! Well, we can thank God we got that right, anyway. Now listen: I\u0027m coming home. Tonight I mean today! On the first possible flight. Carl Quint will stay out here and see this end sewn up, but I\u0027m coming back. Don\u0027t wait for me if I can\u0027t get down to Devon in time. Go in as planned. Have you got that?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 The other\u0027s voice was grim. \u0027Oh, yes, I\u0027ve got that! Christ, and I\u0027m looking forward to it!\u0027\n Kyle\u0027s eyes narrowed, grew very bright and fierce. \u0027Have Peter\u0027s body burned,\u0027 he said, \u0027just in case . .\n And then burn Bodescu. Burn all the blood-sucking bastards!\u0027\n Quint gently took the phone from him and said, \u0027Guy, Carl here. Listen, this is top priority. Get a couple of our best men up to Hartlepool A.S.A.P. Darcy Clarke especially. Do it now, even before you move on Harkley.\u0027\n \u0027Right,\u0027 Roberts answered. \u0027I\u0027ll do it.\u0027 Then he got the point. His gasp was perfectly audible, even over the none too clear connection. \u0027Hell, of course I\u0027ll do it right now!\u0027\n Wide-eyed and pale, Kyle and Quint stared at each other. There was no need to give voice to what was on their minds. Yulian Bodescu had learned almost everything there was to know about them. Keen had access, as had they all, to the Keogh file. A vampire\u0027s greatest fear is to be discovered for what he is. He will try to destroy anyone who even suspects him.\n INTESP knew what he was, and the focus the jinni loci of INTESP was someone called Harry Keogh.\n Darcy Clarke had swallowed two double brandies in quick succession before insisting on going back on duty. That had been shortly before Roberts\u0027s call to the Hotel Dunarea in Bucharest. Roberts, at first dubious, had finally let Clarke go back to Harkley, but with this warning: \u0027Darcy, stay in your car. Don\u0027t leave it, no matter what. I know you have your juju working, but in this case it mightn\u0027t be enough. But we do need someone watching that hell-house, at least until we can get fully mobilised, and so if you\u0027re volunteering. .\n Clarke had driven carefully, coldly back to Harkley House and parked on the stiff black grass close to where Keen\u0027s car had stood. He tried not to think about the ground where his car stood, or what had happened there.\n He was aware of it would never forget it but he kept it on the periphery of his consciousness, didn\u0027t let it interfere. And so with his gun and loaded crossbow beside him he\u0027d sat there watching the house, never taking his eyes off it for a moment.\n Fear had turned to hatred in Clarke\u0027s heart; he was here as a duty, yes, but it was more than that. Bodescu might just come out, might just show his face, and if he did... Clarke needed desperately to kill him.\n In the house Yulian sat in darkness by his garret window. He, too, had known a little fear, something of panic. But now, like Clarke, he was cold, calm, calculating. For now, with one very important exception, he knew all there was to know about the watchers. The one thing he didn\u0027t know was when. But certainly it would be soon. He gazed out into the darkness and could sense the approaching dawn. Down there, beyond the gate, in a car in the field across the road, someone else watched. Ah, but this one would be better prepared. Yulian sent his vampire senses reaching into the cold and misty pre-dawn gloom, touched lightly upon a mind. Hatred lashed out at him before the mind closed itself - but not before he recognised it. Yulian merely grinned. He sent his telepathic thoughts down to the vaulted cellars: Vlad, an old friend of yours is keeping a vigil on the house. 1 want you to watch him. But don\u0027t let him see you, and don\u0027t try to hurt him. They are wary now, these watchers, and coiled like springs. If you are seen it may not go well for you. So just watch him, and let me know if he moves or does anything other than watch us! Now go. .A huge black shadow, slope-eared, feral-eyed, padded silently up the narrow steps in the small building standing towards the rear of the house. It came out into the grounds, turned towards the gates, kept to the darker areas of trees and shrubbery. Tongue lolling, Vlad hastened to obey. .\n Yulian called the women down into the main living room on the ground floor. It was totally dark in that room, but each present could see the others perfectly well. Like it or not, night was now their element. When they were assembled, Yulian seated himself beside Helen on a couch, waited a moment to be sure he had the full attention of the women, then spoke.\n \u0027Ladies,\u0027 he commenced, mockingly, his voice low and sinister, \u0027it will soon be dawn. I can\u0027t be certain but I rather fancy that it will be one of the last dawns you ever see. Men will come and they will try to kill you. That may not be easy, but they\u0027re determined and they\u0027ll try very hard.\u0027\n \u0027Yulian!\u0027 His mother at once stood up, her voice shocked; fearful. \u0027What have you done?\u0027\n \u0027Sit down!\u0027 he commanded, glaring at her. She obeyed, but reluctantly. And when she was perched again on the edge of her chair, he said, \u0027I have done what I must do to protect myself. And you all of you - shall be obliged to do likewise, or die. Soon.\u0027\n Helen, simultaneously fascinated and horrified by Yulian, her skin crawling with her fear of him, timorously touched his arm. \u0027I shall do whatever you ask of me, Yulian.\u0027\n He thrust her away, almost hurled her from the couch. \u0027Fight for yourself, slut! That is all I ask. Not for me but for yourself - if you desire to live!\u0027\n Helen cringed away from him. \u0027I only - ,\n \u0027Only be quiet!\u0027 he snarled. \u0027You must fight for yourselves, for I shall not be here. I\u0027m leaving with the dawn, when they\u0027d least expect me to leave. But you three will remain. While you are here they may be fooled into thinking that I am still here.\u0027 He nodded and smiled.\n \u0027Yulian, look at you!\u0027 his mother suddenly hissed, her voice venomous. \u0027You were always a monster inside, and now you\u0027re a monster outside, too! I don\u0027t want to die for you, for even this half-life is better than none, but I don\u0027t intend to fight for it. Nothing you can say or do shall make me kill to preserve what you\u0027ve made of me!\u0027\n He shrugged. \u0027Then you\u0027ll die very quickly.\u0027 He turned his eyes on Anne Lake. \u0027And you, Auntie dear? Will you go to your maker so passively?\u0027\n Anne was wild-eyed, dishevelled. She looked mad. \u0027George is dead!\u0027 she babbled, her hands flying to her hair. \u0027And Helen is... changed. My life is finished.\u0027 She stopped fussing, leaned forward in her chair and glowered at Yulian. \u0027I hate you!\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I know you do,\u0027 he nodded. \u0027But will you let them kill you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d be better off dead,\u0027 she answered.\n \u0027Ah, but such a death!\u0027 he said. \u0027You saw George go, Auntie dear, and so you know how hard it was. The stake, the cleaver, and the fire.\u0027\n She sprang to her feet, shook her head wildly. \u0027They wouldn\u0027t! People... don\u0027t!\u0027\n \u0027But these people do,\u0027 he gazed at her wide-eyed, almost innocently, aping her expression. \u0027They will, for they know what you are. They know that you\u0027re Wamphyri!\u0027\n \u0027We can leave this place!\u0027 Anne cried. \u0027Come on, Georgina, Helen we\u0027ll leave right now!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, go!\u0027 Yulian snapped, as if done with them, utterly sick of them. \u0027Do go, all of you. Leave me - go now. .\n They looked at him uncertainly, blinking their yellow eyes in unison. \u0027I won\u0027t stop you,\u0027 he told them with a shrug. He got to his feet, made to leave the room. \u0027No, not I. But they will! They\u0027ll stop you dead! They\u0027re out there now, watching - and waiting.\u0027\n \u0027Yulian, where are you going?\u0027 His mother stood up, looked as if she might even try to take hold of him, detain him. He forced her back with nothing but a growl of warning, swept by her.\n \u0027I have preparations to make,\u0027 he said, \u0027for my departure. I imagine that you, too, will have certain final things you want to do. Prayers to some non-existent god, perhaps? Cherished photographs to look at? Old friends and lovers to remember, while you may?\u0027 And sneering, he left them to their own devices.\n Tuesday, 8.40 A.M. middle-European time, the airport in Bucharest.\n Alec Kyle\u0027s flight was due to leave in twenty-five minutes and the passengers had just been called forward. Kyle would be in Rome in two-and-a-half hours; given that there would be no problems with his connection, he\u0027d be into Heathrow around 2.00 P.M. local time. With a bit of luck he would reach his destination in Devon with half an hour to spare before Guy Roberts and his team went in and \u0027cleaned up\u0027 at Harkley House. Even if his timings were wrong, Roberts should still be in situ at the house when- finally he did arrive. The last stages of his journey would be by MOD helicopter from Heathrow down to Torquay, and on to Paignton in an air-sea rescue chopper courtesy of the Torbay coastguard.\n Kyle had made these final arrangements by telephone from the airport via John Grieve in London as soon as he\u0027d discovered that he couldn\u0027t get a flight until now. And mercifully, for once, he\u0027d got the call through without too much difficulty.\n On hearing the call for embarkation, Felix Krakovitch stepped forward and took Kyle\u0027s hand. \u0027A lot has happened in a short time,\u0027 the Russian psychic said. \u0027But to know you has been... my pleasure.\u0027 They shook hands awkwardly, but both men meant it. Sergei Gulharov was much more open: he hugged Kyle close and kissed his cheeks. Kyle shrugged and grinned, he hoped not too sheepishly. He was only glad he\u0027d said his farewells to Irma Dobresti the previous night. Carl Quint nodded and gave him a thumbs-up signal.\n Krakovitch carried Kyle\u0027s hand luggage to the departure gate. From there Kyle went on alone, through the gates and out onto the asphalt, finding a space in the jostling line of passengers. He looked back once, waved, turned and hurried on.\n Quint, Krakovitch and Gulharov watched him go, waiting until he rounded the corner of the massive air control tower and so out of sight. Then they quickly left the airport. Now they were ready to commence their own journey: up into old Moldavia, where they\u0027d cross the Russian border by car over the River Prut. Krakovitch had already made the necessary arrangements - through his Second in Command, of course, at the Ch\u0026acirc;teau Bronnitsy.\n Out on the airfield, Kyle approached his plane. Close to the foot of the mobile boarding stairway, uniformed aircrew saluted him and checked his boarding pass one last time. A smiling official stepped forward, glanced at Kyle\u0027s boarding pass. \u0027Mr Kyle? One moment please.\u0027 His voice was bland, conveyed nothing. Nor did Kyle\u0027s in-built warning system. Why should it? There was nothing outside of nature here. On the contrary, what was coming was very down-to-earth but terrifying for all that.\n As the last of the passengers disappeared into the body of the aircraft, three men emerged from behind the stairs.\n - They wore lightweight overcoats and dark grey felt hats. though their clothes were intended to lend anonymity, hey were almost a uniform in their own right, an unmistakeable mode of identification. Even if Kyle hadn\u0027t known them, he would have recognised the cases one of them was carrying. His cases.\n Two of the KGB men, unsmiling, restrained him while the third moved up very close, put down his suitcases and took his cabin luggage. Kyle felt a stab of fear, a moment of panic.\n \u0027Need I introduce myself?\u0027 The Russian agent\u0027s eyes bored into Kyle\u0027s.\n Kyle found his nerve, shook his head and managed a rueful smile. \u0027I think not,\u0027 he answered. \u0027How are you this morning, Mr Dolgikh? Or should I simply call you Theo?\u0027\n \u0027Try \"Comrade\",\u0027 said Dolgikh without humour. \u0027That will suffice . .\n Whatever Yulian Bodescu\u0027s intentions had been, he had not left Harkley House at dawn.\n At 5.00 A.M. Ken Layard and Simon Gower arrived to relieve Darcy Clarke, who then returned to Paignton. At 6.00 A.M. Trevor Jordan joined Layard and Gower; the three split up, formed points of triangulation. An hour later there were two more men, reinforcements Roberts had earlier called down from London. All of these arrivals were dutifully reported by Vlad, until Yulian cautioned the huge dog and ordered him down to the cellars. It was broad daylight now and Vlad would be seen coming and going. The Alsatian was Yulian\u0027s rearguard and no harm must come to him just yet.\n The enemy\u0027s numbers had penned Yulian in; but just as bad from his point of view was the fact that the day was cloudless, the risen sun bright and strong. The mists of the night had soon been steamed away, and the air was clear and smelled fresh. Behind the house, beyond the wall that marked the boundary of the grounds, woods rose to the top of a low hill. There was a track through the woods and one of the watchers had somehow managed to get his vehicle up there. He sat there now, watching the house through binoculars. Yulian could easily have seen him through one of the upper storey rear windows, but he didn\u0027t need to. He sensed that he was there.\n At the front of the house were two more watchers: one not far from the gate, standing beside his car, the other fifty yards away. Their weapons were not visible but Yulian knew they had crossbows. And he knew the agony a hardwood bolt would cause him. Two more men guarded the flanks, one at each side of the house, where they could look into the grounds across the walls.\n Yulian was trapped - for the moment.\n Fight? He couldn\u0027t even leave the house without them seeing him. And those crossbows of theirs would be deadly accurate. The day wore on through midday and into the afternoon, and Yulian began to sweat. At 3.00 P.M. a sixth man came on the scene - driving a truck. Yulian watched carefully from behind the curtains at his garret window.\n The driver of the truck must be the leader of these damned psychic spies. The leader of this group, anyway. He was fat, but in no way clumsy; his mind would be hard and clear, except he guarded his thoughts like gold. He began to distribute indeterminate items of heavy equipment in canvas containers, also jerrycans, food and drink, to the other men. He spent a little time with each of them, talking to them, demonstrated with certain pieces of equipment, gave instructions. Yulian sweated more yet. He knew now that it would be this evening. Traffic rolled as usual on the autumn road; couples walked together in the sunshine hand in hand; birds sang in the woods. The world looked the same as it always looked - but those men out there had determined that this would be Yulian Bodescu\u0027s last day.\n Using what cover he could find, the vampire risked his neck making excursions outside the house. He used a rear ground floor window where it was shrouded by shrubbery, also the cellar exit through the out-building. Twice, if he\u0027d been fully prepared, he might have made a break for it, when the watchers to the rear and at one side of the house went down to the road for their supplies; on both occasions they returned while he was still calculating the odds. Yulian grew still more nervous, his thinking becoming very erratic.\n Back in the house, whenever he crossed tracks with one of the women, he would lash out, shout, curse. His nervousness transferred itself to Vlad and the great dog prowled the empty cellars to and fro, to and fro.\n Then, about 4.00 P.M., suddenly Yulian was aware of a weird psychic stillness, the mental lull before the storm. He strained his vampire senses to- their fullest extent and could detect... nothing! The watchers had screened their minds, so that not even a trace of their thoughts their intentions could escape. In so doing they gave away their final secret, they told Yulian the time they had planned for his death.\n It was to be now, within the hour, and the light only just beginning to fade as the sun lowered itself towards the horizon.\n Yulian put fear aside. He was Wamphyri! These men had powers, yes, and they were strong. But he had powers too. And he might yet prove to be stronger.\n He went down into the cellars and spoke to Vlad:\n You\u0027ve been faithful to me as only a dog can be, he said, facing the great beast, their yellow eyes locked, but you are more than a dog. Those men out there might suspect that, and they might not. Whichever, when they come, you go out first to meet them. Give no quarter. if you survive, seek me out. .\n And then he \u0027spoke\u0027 to the Other, that loathsome extrusion of himself. It was the implanting of suggestions in a blank space, the imprinting of an idea upon a void, the burning of a brand into a beast\u0027s hide. Floor flags buckled in one dark corner, the ground underfoot shifted and dust fell in rills from the low vaulting. That was all. Perhaps it had understood, and perhaps not .\n Finally Yulian returned to his room. He changed his clothes, put on a neutral grey track-suit and shoved his wide-brimmed hat into the waistband. He neatly folded a suit of clothes into a small travelling case, along with a wallet containing a good deal of money in large notes. That was that; he needed nothing more.\n Then, as the minutes ticked by, he sat down, closed his eyes and pitted his own dark nature against the great Mother Nature herself in one final test of his now mature vampire powers. He willed a mist, called up a wreathing white screen from the earth and the streams and the woods, a clinging fog down from the hillsides.\n The watchers, tense now and taut as the strings of their crossbows, scarcely noticed the sun slipping behind the clouds and the ground mist creeping at their ankles; as a man, their attention was riveted on the house.\n And time moved inexorably towards the appointed hour .\n I Darcy Clarke drove furiously north. He had cursed aloud until his throat was raw,. and then silently until his cursing had come down to one four-letter word repeated over and ver again in his fuming mind. What his fury amounted to was this: he wouldn\u0027t be in on the kill. He was out of the attack on Harkley. Now, instead, he was to be minder in-chief to a... a tiny infant!\n Clarke was well aware of the importance of his new task and understood the purpose of it: with his talent it is unlikely that any harm would come to him. And so, if he was shielding the young Harry Keogh, the baby should likewise be safe. But to Darcy\u0027s way of thinking, prevention was better than cure. Stop Bodescu dead at Harkley House, and you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about the baby at all. And if he, Darcy Clarke, was at Harkley - if only he was there then guarantee Bodescu would be stopped!\n But he wasn\u0027t there, he was here, driving north for that godforsaken hole Hartlepool.\n On the other hand, he knew that every single man of them back there was equally dedicated to Bodescu\u0027s destruction. Which helped a little.\n Clarke had got back to Paignton before 6.00 A.M. and Roberts had ordered him straight into bed. Later, he said, he would have a big job for him and wanted him to get at least six hours\u0027 sleep. Finally Clarke had dozed off, and though he\u0027d feared the very worst dreams none had come. At noon Roberts had shaken him awake, told him what his new job was. Since when Clarke had been driving, and cursing.\n He had joined the M1 at Leicester, then picked up the A19 at Thirsk. He was now something less than an hour from his destination, and the time was (he glanced at his watch) - 4.50P.M.\n Clarke stopped cursing. God! What would it be like right now, down there?\n \u0027Where the hell did this mist spring from?\u0027 Trevor Jordan shivered, turning up the collar of his coat. \u0027Hell, it was a nice day, from the weather point of view, anyway.\u0027 For all his vehemence, Jordan had spoken in a whisper.\n All of the INTESP agents, at their various stations around Harkley House, had been speaking in whispers for the last twenty minutes. At 4.30, working to Roberts\u0027s instructions, they\u0027d formed pairs - which was as well, for the mist had thickened up and started to threaten their individual security. It felt nice to have someone really close to you.\n Jordan\u0027s \u0027buddy\u0027 in the system was Ken Layard the locator. He was shivering, too, despite the fact that he carried seventy-eight pounds of Brissom Mark III flame-thrower on his back. \u0027I\u0027m not sure,\u0027 he finally answered Jordan\u0027s question, \u0027but I think it\u0027s from him.\u0027 He nodded towards the house where it stood swathed in mist.\n They were just inside the north wall, at a place where they\u0027d found a gap in the stonework. Just a minute ago, at 4.50, they\u0027d checked their watches and squeezed through, and Jordan had helped Layard into his asbestos leggings and jacket. Then they\u0027d strapped the tank on his back and he\u0027d checked the valve on the hose and trigger mechanism. With the valve open, all he had to do was squeeze the trigger and he could conjure up an inferno. And he fully intended to.\n \u0027Him?\u0027 Jordan frowned. He looked around at the mist. It crept everywhere. From here the rear wall up the hillside was invisible; likewise the wall fronting onto the road. Harvey Newton and Simon Gower would be making their way down from the hill, Ben Trask and Guy Roberts coming up the drive from the gate. They would all converge on the house together, at 5.00 P.M. sharp. \u0027Who do you mean, \"him\"? Bodescu?\u0027 Jordan led the way through shrubbery towards the dimly looming mass of the house. .\n \u0027Bodescu, yes,\u0027 Layard answered. \u0027I\u0027m a locator, remember? It\u0027s my thing.\u0027\n What\u0027s that got to do with the mist?\u0027 Jordan\u0027s nerves were starting to jump. He was a telepath of uncertain kill, but Roberts had warned him not to try it on Bodescu and certainly not at this crucial stage of play.\n \u0027When I try to find him in my mind\u0027s eye,\u0027 Layard attempted to explain, \u0027inside the house there, I can\u0027t zero in on him. It\u0027s as if he were part of the mist. That\u0027s why I think he\u0027s somehow behind it. I sense him as a huge amorphous cloud of fog!\u0027\n \u0027Jesus!\u0027 Jordan whispered, shivering again. In utter, eerie silence they moved towards the small outbuilding, whose open door led down to the cellars.\n Simon Gower and Harvey Newton approached the house from the gently sloping field of shrubs at its rear. There wasn\u0027t too much cover so the mist was a boon to them. So they thought. Newton was a telepath, called down from London along with Ben Trask as reinforcements. Newton and Trask weren\u0027t quite as au fait with the situation as the rest, which was why they\u0027d been split up.\n \u0027What a team we make, eh?\u0027 said Newton nervously as the ground levelled out and the mist billowed up more yet. \u0027You with that bloody great torch on your back and me with a crossbow? You know, if this stake-out is a dud, we\u0027re going to look awfully - \u0027\n \u0027God!\u0027 Gower cut him short, dropped to one knee and worked furiously at the valve on his hose.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Newton gave a massive start, glared all about, held his loaded crossbow out in front of him like a shield. \u0027What?\u0027 He couldn\u0027t see anything, but he knew Gower\u0027s talent lay in reading the future - especially the immediate future!\n \u0027It\u0027s coming!\u0027 Gower no longer whispered. In fact, he was shouting. \u0027It\u0027s coming - NOW!\u0027\n At the front of the house, where Guy Roberts and Ben Trask pulled up in Roberts\u0027s truck, Gower\u0027s shouting wasn\u0027t heard over the throbbing of the vehicle\u0027s engine.\n But on the north-facing side of the house it was. Trevor Jordan instinctively crouched down, then began to run at an angle towards the rear of the building. Ken Layard, hampered by his flame-thrower load, was slower off the mark.\n Layard, stumbling through damp shrubbery, saw Jordan\u0027s figure swallowed into a rolling bank of mist where he ran past the open door in the small outbuilding\n - then saw something erupt from that door in a snarling, slavering frenzy! Bodescu\u0027s great dog! Without pause the flame-eyed brute hurled itself into the mist after Jordan.\n \u0027Trevor, behind you!\u0027 Layard yelled at the top of his voice. He yanked open the valve on his hose, jerked the trigger, prayed: God, please don\u0027t let me burn Trevor!\n A roaring, gouting stream of yellow fire tore open the curtain of mist like a blowtorch through cobwebs. Jordan was already round the corner of the house, but Vlad was still in view, bounding purposefully after him. The expanding, blistering \u0027V\u0027 of heat reached after the dog, touched him, enveloped him but briefly. Then he, too, was round the corner. -\n By now, at the front of the house, Guy Roberts and Ben Trask were down from the truck. Roberts heard shouting, the roar of a flame-thrower. It was still a minute or two to five but the attack had started which probably meant that the other side had started it. Roberts put a police whistle to his lips, gave one short blast. Now, whatever else was happening, all six INTESP agents would move on the house together.\n Roberts had the third flame-thrower; he headed straight for the main door of the house where it stood ajar in the shadow of a columned portico. Trask followed. He was a human lie-detector; his talent had no application here, but he was also young, quick-thinking and he knew how to look after himself. As he made to follow Roberts something caught his attention: a furtive movement glimpsed in the very corner of his eye.\n \u0027Twenty-five yards away between billowing banks of mist, a flowing figure had passed swiftly, silently inside the shell of the old barn. Who or whatever had gone in there, there would be nothing to stop it from clearing off out of the grounds once Roberts and Trask were inside the house. \u0027Oh no you don\u0027t!\u0027 Trask grunted. And raising his voice: \u0027Guy, in the barn there.\u0027\n Roberts, at the door of the house, turned to see Trask running at a crouch towards the barn. Cursing under his breath, he strode after him.\n At the back of Harkley House, Vlad came coughing and mewling out of the mist and attempted to spring at the three men he found there. The dog was a blackened silhouette sheathed in smoke and flame, burning even as he launched himself lopsidedly at Jordan\u0027s back.\n As Jordan had come running round the corner of the building, Gower had very nearly triggered his flame-thrower; he\u0027d recognised Jordan only at the last possible moment. Harvey Newton, on the other hand, had actually -drawn a bead on the misted figure and was in the act of firing his bolt when Gower cried a warning and shouldered him aside. The bolt flashed harmlessly off at a tangent and disappeared in mist and distance. Fortunately Jordan had seen the two men saw them apparently aiming at him and thrown himself flat. He hadn\u0027t seen what pursued him, however, which even now overshot his sprawled body and arced overhead in a cloud of sparks and smoulder. Vlad landed awkwardly, gathered himself to spring at Newton and Gower, and discovered himself forging head-on into a withering jet of flame from Gower\u0027s torch. The dog crumpled to earth, a blazing, crackling, screaming ball of fire that tried to run in all directions at once and ran nowhere.\n Jordan got to his feet and the three men stood panting, watching Vlad burn. Newton had fumblingly reloaded his crossbow; he thought he saw something move in the mist and turned in that direction. What was that? A loping shape? Or... just his imagination? The others didn\u0027t seem to have noticed; they were watching Vlad.\n \u0027Oh my God!\u0027 Jordan gasped. Newton saw the look on Jordan\u0027s face, forgot the thing he thought he had seen, turned to watch the death agonies of the incandescent dog.\n Vlad\u0027s blackened body throbbed and vibrated, burst open, put up a nest of tentacles that twined like alien fingers four or five feet into the air. Mouthing obscenities, eyes bulging, Gower hosed the thing down with fire. The tentacles steamed, blistered and collapsed but the dog\u0027s body continued to pulsate.\n \u0027Jesus Christ!\u0027 Jordan moaned his horror. \u0027He changed the dog, too!\u0027 He unhooked a cleaver from his belt, moved forward, shielded his eyes against the blaze and severed Vlad\u0027s head from his body with one single clean stroke. Jordan backed off, shouted at Gower: \u0027You finish it make sure you finish it! I heard Roberts\u0027s whistle just now. Harvey and me will go on in.\u0027\n As Gower continued to burn the remains of the dog-thing, Jordan and Newton went stumbling through smoke and reek to the rear wall of the house, where they found an open window. They looked at each other, then licked their lips nervously in unison. Both of them were breathing raggedly of the sodden, stinking air.\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 said Jordan. \u0027Cover me.\u0027 He aimed his crossbow in front of him, swung his leg across the window sill . .\n In the barn Ben Trask pulled up short, his square face alert, ears attentive to the silence. The silence said there w as no one here, but it was lying. Trask knew it as surely is if he sat behind a one-way window and listened in on an important interrogation by police of big-time criminals. The picture here was false, a lie.\n Old farm implements were strewn everywhere. The mist, billowing in through the open ends of the building, had turned old steel slick with a sort of metallic sweat; chains and worn tyres hung from hooks in the walls; a stack of tongue-and-groove boards teetered uncertainly, as if recently disturbed. Then Trask saw the wooden steps ascending into gloom, and at the same time a single stem of straw where it came drifting down.\n He drew air in a sharp gasp, turned his face and crossbow up towards the badly gapped boarding overhead - and was just in time to see a woman\u0027s insanely working face framed there, and hear her hiss of triumph as she launched a pitchfork at him! Trask had no time to aim but simply pulled the trigger.\n The pitchfork\u0027s sharp offside tine missed him but its twin scraped under his collar bone and passed through his right shoulder, driving him down and backwards. At the same time there came a mad, babbling shriek to end all shrieks, and Anne Lake crashed through rotten boards in a cloud of dust and powdery straw. She landed square on her back, with Trask\u0027s bolt sticking out of her chest dead centre. The bolt alone should have done for her, and the fall certainly, but she was no longer entirely human.\n Trask lay against the side wall and tried to pull the pitchfork out of his shoulder. There was no strength in him; he couldn\u0027t do it; pain and shock had left him weak as a kitten. He could only watch and try to keep from blacking out as Yulian Bodescu\u0027s \u0027auntie\u0027 crept towards him on all fours, grabbed the pitchfork and yanked it viciously free. And then Trask did black out.\n Anne Lake drew back the pitchfork, growling like a big cat as she aimed it at Trask\u0027s heart. Behind her, Guy Roberts grabbed the fork\u0027s wooden handle, hauled on it and threw her off balance. She howled her frustration, fell on her back again, grasped the bolt in her chest with both hands and tried to draw it out. Roberts, impeded by the apparatus on his back, lumbered by her, took hold of Trask by the front of his jacket and somehow managed to drag him clear of the barn. Then he turned back, aimed his hose, and applied a firm and steady pressure to the trigger.\n The barn was at once transformed into a gigantic oven; heat and fire and smoke filled it floor to tiled roof, spilling out of its open ends. And in the middle of it all something screamed and screamed, a wildly hissing, rising scream that finally shut itself off as the upper floor collapsed and tipped blazing hay down into the roaring inferno. And still Roberts kept his finger on the trigger, until he knew that nothing - nothing - could have survived in there .\n At the back of -the house Ken Layard found Gower burning Vlad. Jordan had just stepped in through the open window and Newton was about to follow him. \u0027Hold it!\u0027 Layard shouted. \u0027You can\u0027t work two crossbows together!\u0027 He came forward. \u0027I\u0027ll go in this way,\u0027 he told Newton, \u0027with Jordan. You stick with Gower and go round the front. Go now!\u0027\n As Layard clambered awkwardly in through the window, Newton dragged Gower away from the cindered, smoking thing that had been Vlad and jerked his thumb towards the far corner of the house. \u0027That thing\u0027s finished,\u0027 he shouted, \u0027so now get a grip of yourself! Come on the others will be inside by now.\u0027\n They quickly made their way through the mist-wreathed gardens on the south side of the house, and saw Roberts turn away from the blazing barn and drag Trask out of the danger area. Roberts saw them, yelled: \u0027What the hell\u0027s going on?\u0027\n \u0027Gower burned the dog,\u0027 Newton yelled back. \u0027Except it wasn\u0027t... wasn\u0027t a dog not any more!\u0027\n Roberts\u0027s lips drew back from his teeth in a half-snarl, half-grimace. \u0027We got Anne Lake,\u0027 he said, as Newton and Gower came closer. \u0027And, of course, she wasn\u0027t all woman! Where\u0027re Layard and Jordan?\u0027\n \u0027Inside,\u0027 said Gower. He was shaking, rivered in sweat. \u0027And it\u0027s not finished yet, Guy. Not yet. There\u0027s more to come!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve tried scanning the house,\u0027 Roberts said. \u0027Nothing! Just a fog in there. A mental fucking fog! Pointless trying, anyway. Too damned much going on!\u0027 He grabbed Gower. \u0027You OK?\u0027\n Gower nodded. \u0027I think so.\u0027\n \u0027Right. Now listen. Thermite bombs in the truck; plastic explosive, too, in haversacks. Dump \u0027em in the cellars. Spread \u0027em out. Try to take \u0027em all down in one go. And no torching while you\u0027re holding the stuff! In fact get out of that kit and take a crossbow like Newton. The stuff\u0027s all set to go off from excessive heat or naked flame. Plant it and get out and then stay out! Three of us in the house itself should be enough. If not the fire will be.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re going in there?\u0027 Gower looked at the house, licked his lips.\n \u0027I\u0027m going in, yes,\u0027 Roberts nodded. \u0027There\u0027s still Bodescu, his mother and the girl to account for. And don\u0027t worry about me. Worry about yourself. The cellars could be far worse than the house.\u0027 He headed for the open door under the columned portico . . \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-ii-wamphyri-necroscope-2/page-13.html","bookId":2117,"book":{"id":2117,"title":"Necroscope II: Wamphyri (Necroscope #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The spirit of Harry Keogh now resides in his son, Harry Jr. When his infant son sleeps, Harry can roam the Continuum and speak to the dead, but is gradually losing his control as the son \"reels\" his father\u0027s spirit back in.
