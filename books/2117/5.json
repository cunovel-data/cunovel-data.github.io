{"id":92836,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u0027He was a funny little thing!\u0027 Anne Lake laughed, shook her head and set her blonde hair flying in the breeze from the car\u0027s half-open window. \u0027Do you remember when we had him that year?\u0027\n It was late in the summer of \u002777 and they were driving down to stay with Georgina and Yulian for a week. The last time they\u0027d seen them was two years ago. George had thought the boy was strange then, and he\u0027d said so on several occasions - not to Georgina and certainly not to Yulian himself, of course not, but to Anne, in private. Now he said so again:\n \u0027Funny little thing?\u0027 He cocked an eyebrow. \u0027That\u0027s one way of putting it, I suppose. Weird would be a better way! And from what I remember of him last time we came down he hasn\u0027t changed - what was a weird baby is now a weird young man!\u0027\n \u0027Oh, George, that\u0027s ridiculous. All babies are different from each other. Yulian was, well, more different, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 said George. That child wasn\u0027t two months old when he came to us - and he had teeth! Teeth like little needles - sharp as hell! And I remember Georgina saying he was born with them. That\u0027s why she couldn\u0027t breast-feed him.\u0027\n \u0027George,\u0027 said Anne warningly, a little sharply, reminding him that Helen sat in the back of the car. She was their daughter: a beautiful, occasionally precocious girl of sixteen.\n Helen sighed, very deliberately and audibly, and said,\n \u0027Oh, mother! I know what breasts are for - apart from being natural attractions for the opposite sex, that is. Why must you put them on your taboo list?\u0027\n \u0027Ta-boob list!\u0027 George grinned.\n \u0027George!\u0027 said Anne again, more forcefully.\n \u0027Nineteen seventy-seven,\u0027 Helen scoffed, \u0027but you\u0027d never know it. Not in this family. I mean, feeding your baby\u0027s natural, isn\u0027t it? More natural than letting your breasts be groped in the back row of some grubby flea-pit cinema!\u0027\n \u0027Helen!\u0027 Anne half-turned in her seat, her lips com-pressing to a thin line.\n \u0027It\u0027s been a long time,\u0027 George glanced at his wife, semi-ruefully.\n \u0027What has?\u0027 she snapped.\n \u0027Since I was groped in a flea-pit cinema,\u0027 he said.\n Anne snorted her exasperation. \u0027She gets it from you!\u0027 she accused. \u0027You\u0027ve always treated her like an adult.\u0027\n \u0027Because she is an adult, very nearly,\u0027 he answered. \u0027You can only guide them so far, Anne my love, and after that they\u0027re on their own. Helen\u0027s healthy, intelligent, happy, good-looking, and she doesn\u0027t smoke pot. She\u0027s worn a bra for nearly four years, and every month she -\u0027 \u0027George! \u0027Taboo!\u0027 said Helen, giggling.\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 George\u0027s irritation was showing now, \u0027we weren\u0027t talking about Helen but Yulian. Helen, I submit, is normal. Her cousin - or cousin once removed, or whatever-is not.\u0027\n \u0027Give me a for-instance,\u0027 Anne argued. \u0027An example. Not normal, you say. Well then, is he abnormal? Subnormal? Where\u0027s his defect?\u0027\n \u0027Whenever Yulian crops up,\u0027 Helen joined in from the back, \u0027you two always end up arguing. Is he really worth it?\u0027\n \u0027Your mother\u0027s a very loyal person,\u0027 George told her over one shoulder. \u0027Georgina is her cousin and Yulian is Georgina\u0027s son. Which means they\u0027re untouchable. Your mother won\u0027t face simple facts, that\u0027s all. She\u0027s the same with all her friends: she won\u0027t hear a word against them. Very laudable. But I call a spade a spade. I find - and have always found - Yulian a bit much. As I said before, weird.\u0027\n \u0027You mean,\u0027 Helen pressed, \u0027a bit nine-bob notish?\u0027\n \u0027Helen!\u0027 her mother protested yet again.\n \u0027I get that one from you!\u0027 Helen stopped her dead in her tracks. \u0027You always talk about gays as nine-bobbers.\u0027\n \u0027I never talk about... about homosexuals!\u0027 Anne was furious. \u0027And certainly not to you about them!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard Daddy - in conversation with you, about one or two of his man-friends - say that so-and-so is gay as a defrocked vicar,\u0027 said Helen matter-of-factly. \u0027And you\u0027ve replied: \"What, so-and-so, nine-bobbish? Really?\"\u0027\n Anne rounded on her and might well have lashed out physically if she could have reached her. Red-faced, she cried, \u0027Then in future we\u0027ll have to lock you in your bloody room before we dare have an adult conversation! You horrid girl!\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps you better had.\u0027 Helen was equally quick to rise. \u0027Before I also start to swear!\u0027\n \u0027All right, all right.r George quietened them. \u0027Points taken all round. But we\u0027re on holiday, remember? I mean, it\u0027s probably my fault, but Yulian\u0027s a sore point with me, that\u0027s all. And I can\u0027t even explain why. But he usually keeps out of the way most of the time we\u0027re there, and I can\u0027t help it but I hope it\u0027s the same this time. For my peace of mind, anyway. He\u0027s simply not my type of lad. As for him being how\u0027s-your-father - \u0027 (Helen some-how contrived not to snigger) \u0027 - I can\u0027t say. But he did get kicked out of that boarding school, and - \u0027\n \u0027He did not!\u0027 Anne had to have her say. \u0027Kicked out, indeed! He got his qualifications a year early, left a year before the rest. I mean to say, do qualifications - does being intelligent above the average - certify someone as a raving... homosexual? Heaven forbid! Clever Miss Know-it-all here has a couple of second class \"A\" levels, which apparently make her near-omniscient; in which case Yulian has to be close to godlike! George, what qualifications do you have?\u0027\n \u0027I fail to see what that has to do with it,\u0027 he answered. \u0027The way I hear it, more gays come out of the universities than ever came out of all the secondary moderns put together. And-\u0027\n \u0027George?\u0027\n \u0027I was an apprentice,\u0027 he sighed, \u0027as you well know. Trade qualifications, I\u0027ve got them all. And then I was a journeyman - an architect earning money for my boss, until I got into business for myself. And anyway - \u0027\n \u0027What academic qualifications?\u0027 she was determined.\n George drove the car, said nothing, wound down his window a little and breathed warm air. After a while: The same as you, darling.\u0027\n \u0027None whatsoever!\u0027 Anne was triumphant. \u0027Why, Yulian\u0027s cleverer than all of us put together. On paper, anyway. I say give him time and he\u0027ll show us all a thing or two. Oh, I admit he\u0027s quiet, comes and goes like a ghost, seems less active and enthusiastic about life than a boy his age should be. But give him a break, for God\u0027s sake! Look at his disadvantages. He never knew his father; was brought up by Georgina entirely on her own, and she\u0027s never been altogether with it since Ilya died, has lived in that gloomy old mansion of a place for twelve years of his young life. Little wonder he\u0027s a bit, well, reticent.\u0027\n She seemed to have won the day. They said nothing to dispute her logic, had apparently lost all interest in the argument. Anne searched her mind for a new topic, found nothing, relaxed in her seat.\n Reticent. Helen turned her own thoughts over in her head. Yulian, reticent? Did her mother mean backward? Of course not, her argument had been all against that. Shy? Retiring? Yes, that\u0027s what she must have meant. Well, and he must seem shy - if one didn\u0027t know better. Helen knew better, from that time two years ago. And as for queer - hardly. She would greatly doubt it, anyway. She smiled secretly. Better to let them go on thinking it, though. At least while they thought he was a woofter they wouldn\u0027t worry about her being in his company. But no, Yulian wasn\u0027t entirely gay. AC, DC, maybe.\n Two years ago, yes...\n It had taken Helen ages to get him to talk to her. She remembered the circumstances clearly.\n It had been a beautiful Saturday, their second day of a ten-day spell; her parents and Aunt Georgina gone off to Salcombe for a day\u0027s sea- and sun-bathing; Yulian and Helen were left in charge of the house, he with his Alsatian pup to play with and she to explore the gardens, the great barn, the crumbling old stables and the dark, dense copse. Yulian wasn\u0027t into bathing, indeed he hated the sun and sea, and Helen would have preferred anything rather than spend time with her parents.\n \u0027Walk with me?\u0027 she\u0027d pressed Yulian, finding him alone with the gangling pup in the dim, cool library. He had shook his head.\n Pale in the shade of this one room which the sun never seemed to reach, he\u0027d lounged awkwardly on a settee, fondling the pup\u0027s floppy ears with one hand and holding a book in the other.\n \u0027Why not? You could show me the grounds.\u0027\n He had glanced at the pup. \u0027He gets tired if he walks too far. He\u0027s still not quite steady on his legs. And I burn easily in the sun. I really don\u0027t much care for the sun. And anyway, I\u0027m reading.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re not much fun to be with,\u0027 she had told him, deliberately pouting. And she\u0027d asked, \u0027Is there still straw in the hayloft over the barn?\u0027\n \u0027Hayloft?\u0027 Yulian had looked surprised. His long, not unhandsome face had formed a soft oval against the dark velvet of the back of the settee. \u0027I haven\u0027t been up there in years.\u0027\n \u0027What are you reading, anyway?\u0027 She sat down beside him, reached for the book held loosely in his long-fingered, soft-looking hand. He drew back, kept the book from her.\n \u0027Not for little girls,\u0027 he said, his expression unchanging.\n Frustrated, she tossed her hair, glanced all about the large room. And it was large, that room; partitioned in the middle, just like a public library, with floor to ceiling shelves and book-lined alcoves all round the walls. It smelled of old books, dusty and musty. No, it reeked of them, so that you almost feared to breathe in case your lungs got filled with words and inks and desiccated glue and paper fibres.\n There was a shallow cupboard in one corner of the room and its door stood open. Tracks in the threadbare carpet showed where Yulian had dragged a stepladder to a certain section of the shelving. The books on the top shelf were almost hidden in gloom, where old cobwebs were gathering dust. But unlike the neat rows of books in the lower shelves, they were piled haphazardly, lying in a jumble as if recently disturbed.\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 she stood up. \u0027I\u0027m a little girl, am I? And what does that make you? We\u0027re only a year apart, you know...\u0027 She went to the stepladder, started to climb.\n Yulian\u0027s Adam\u0027s apple bobbed. He tossed his book aside, came easily to his feet. \u0027You leave that top shelf alone,\u0027 he said unemotionally, coming to the foot of the ladder.\n She ignored him, looked at the titles, read out loud: \u0027Coates, Human Magnetism, or How to Hypnotise. Huh! Mumbo-jumbo! Lycan ... er, Lycanthropy. Eh? And... The Erotic Beardsleyf She clapped her hands delightedly. \u0027What, dirty pictures, Yulian?\u0027 She took the book from the shelf, opened it. \u0027Oh!\u0027 she said, rather more quietly. The black and white drawing on the page where the book had opened was rather more bestial than erotic.\n \u0027Put it down!\u0027 Yulian hissed from below.\n Helen put down the Beardsley, read off more titles. \u0027Vampirism - ugh! Sexual Powers of Satyrs and Nymphomaniacs. Sadism and Sexual Aberration. And... Parasitic Creatures? How diverse! And not dusty at all, these old books. Do you read them a lot, Yulian?\u0027\n He gave the ladder a shake and insisted, \u0027Come down from there!\u0027 His voice was very low, almost menacing. It was guttural, deeper than she\u0027d heard it before. Almost a man\u0027s voice and not a youth\u0027s at all. Then she looked down at him.\n Yulian stood below her, his face turned up at a sharp angle just below the level of her knees. His eyes were like holes punched in a paper face, with pupils shiny as black marbles. She stared hard at him but their eyes didn\u0027t meet, because he wasn\u0027t looking at her face.\n \u0027Why, I do believe,\u0027 she told him then, teasingly, \u0027that you\u0027re quite naughty, really, Yulian! What with these books and everything...\u0027 She had worn her short dress because of the heat, and now she was glad.\n He looked away, touched his brow, turned aside. \u0027You... you wanted to see the barn?\u0027 His voice was soft again.\n \u0027Can we?\u0027 She was down the ladder in a flash. \u0027I love old barns! But your mother said it wasn\u0027t safe.\u0027\n \u0027I think it\u0027s safe enough,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Georgina worries about everything.\u0027 He had called his mother Georgina since he was a little boy. She didn\u0027t seem to mind.\n They went through the rambling house to the front, Yulian excusing himself for a moment to go to his room. He came back wearing dark spectacles and a floppy, wide-brimmed hat. \u0027Now you look like some pallid Mexican brigand,\u0027 Helen told him, leading the way. And with the black Alsatian pup tumbling at their heels, they made their way to the barn.\n In fact it was a very simple outbuilding of stone, with a platform of planks across the high beams to form a hayloft. Next door were the stables, completely run-down, just a derelict old huddle of buildings. Until five or six years ago the Bodescus had let a local farmer winter his ponies on the grounds, and he\u0027d stored hay for them in the barn.\n \u0027Why on earth do you need such a big place to live?\u0027 Helen asked as they entered the barn through a squealing door into shade and dusty sunbeams and the scurry of mice.\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry?\u0027 he said after a moment, his thoughts elsewhere.\n \u0027This place. The whole place. And that high stone wall all the way round it. How much land does it enclose, that fell? Three acres?\u0027\n \u0027Just over three and a half,\u0027 he answered. \u0027A great rambling house, old stables, barns, an over-grown paddock - even a shady copse to walk through in\n the autumn, when the colours are growing old! I mean, why do two ordinary people need so much space just to live in?\u0027\n \u0027Ordinary?\u0027 he looked at her curiously, his eyes moistly gleaming behind dark lenses. \u0027And do you consider your-self ordinary?\u0027\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n \u0027Well I don\u0027t. I think you\u0027re quite extraordinary. So am I, and so is Georgina - all of us for different reasons.\u0027 He sounded very sincere, almost aggressive, as if defying her to contradict him. But then he shrugged. \u0027Anyway, it\u0027s not a question of why we need it. It\u0027s ours, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027But how did you get it? I mean, you couldn\u0027t have bought it! There must be so many other, well, easier places to live.\u0027\n Yulian crossed the paved floor between piles of old slates and rusty, broken-down implements to the foot of the open wooden stairs. \u0027Hayloft,\u0027 he said, turning his dark eyes on her. She couldn\u0027t see those eyes, but she could feel them.\n Sometimes his movements were so fluid it almost seemed as if he were sleep-walking. They were like that now as he climbed the stairs, slowly, step by deliberate step. \u0027There is still straw,\u0027 he said, voice languid as a deep pool.\n She watched him until he passed out of sight. There was a leanness about him, a hunger. Her father thought he was soft, girlish, but Helen guessed otherwise. She saw him as an intelligent animal, as a wolf. Sort of furtive, but unobtrusive, and always there on the edge of things, just waiting for his chance...\n She suddenly felt stifled and took three deep, deliberate gulps of air before following him. Going carefully up the wooden steps, she said, \u0027Now I remember! It was your great-grandfather\u0027s, wasn\u0027t it? The house, I mean.\u0027\n She emerged into the hayloft. Three great bales of hay, blanched with age, stood dusty and withered in a pyramid. One end of the loft stood open, where projecting gables spared it from the elements. Thin, hot beams of sunlight came slanting in from chinks in the tiles, trapping dust-motes like flies in amber, forming yellow spotlights on the floorboards.\n Yulian took out a pocket knife, sliced deftly at the binding of the uppermost bale. It fell to pieces like an ancient book, and he dragged great deep armfuls down onto the boards.\n A bed for a gypsy, thought Helen. Or a wanton.\n She threw herself down, was conscious that her dress rode up above her knickers where she lay face down. She did nothing to adjust it. Instead she spread her legs a little, wriggled her backside and contrived to make the movement seem perfectly unconscious - which it was not.\n Yulian stood still for long moments and she could feel his eyes on her, but she simply cupped her chin in her hands and stared out of the open end of the loft. From here you could see the perimeter wall, the curving drive, the copse. Yulian\u0027s shadow eclipsed several discs of sunlight and she held her breath. The straw stirred and she knew he was right behind her, like a wolf in the forest.\n His floppy hat fell in the straw on her left; his sunglasses plopped down into the hat; he got down beside her on her right, his arm falling casually across her waist. Casually, yes, and light as a feather, but she could feel it like a bar of iron. He lay not quite so far forward, propping his jaw in his right hand, looking at her. His arm, lying across her like that, must feel very awkward. He was taking most of its weight and she could feel it beginning to tremble, but he didn\u0027t seem to mind. But of course he wouldn\u0027t, would he?\n \u0027Great-grandfather\u0027s, yes,\u0027 he finally answered her question. \u0027He lived and died here. The place came down to Georgina\u0027s mother. Her husband, my grandfather, didn\u0027t like it and so they rented it out and lived in London. When they died it fell to Georgina, but by then it was on a life-lease to the old colonel who lived here. Eventually it was his turn to go, and then Georgina came down to sell it. She brought me with her. I wasn\u0027t quite five, I think, but I liked the place and said so. I said we should live here, and Georgina thought it a good idea.\u0027\n \u0027You really are remarkable!\u0027 she said. \u0027I can\u0027t remember anything about when I was five.\u0027 His arm had slid diagonally across her now, so that his fingers barely touched her thigh just below the curve of her bottom. Helen could feel an almost electric tingle in those fingers. They held no such charge, she knew, but that\u0027s how it felt.\n \u0027I remember everything almost from the moment I was born,\u0027 he told her, his voice so even it was very nearly hypnotic. Maybe it was hypnotic. \u0027Sometimes I even think I remember things from before my birth.\u0027\n \u0027Well, that might explain why you\u0027re so \"extraordinary\",\u0027 she told him, \u0027but what is it makes me different?\u0027\n \u0027Your innocence,\u0027 he at once replied, his voice a purr. \u0027And your desire not to be.\u0027 His hand caressed her rump now, the merest touch of electric fingers tracing the curve of her buttocks, to and fro, to and fro.\n Helen sighed, put a piece of straw between her teeth, slowly turned over on to her back. Her dress rode up even more. She didn\u0027t look at Yulian but gazed wide-eyed at the sloping rows of tiles overhead. As she turned so he lifted his hand a fraction, but didn\u0027t take it away.\n \u0027My desire not to be? Not to be innocent? What makes you think that?\u0027 And she thought: because it\u0027s so obvious?\n When he answered, Yulian\u0027s voice was a man\u0027s again. She hadn\u0027t noticed the slow transition, but now she did.\n Thick and dark, that voice, as he said, \u0027I\u0027ve read it. All girls of your age desire not to be innocent.\u0027\n His hand fell on her belly, lingered over her navel, slipped down and crept under the band of her knickers. She stopped him there, trapping his hand with her own. \u0027No, Yulian. You can\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t?\u0027 the word came in a gulp, choking. \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Because you\u0027re right. I am innocent. But also because it\u0027s the wrong time.\u0027\n \u0027Time?\u0027 he was trembling again.\n She pushed him away, sighed abruptly and said, \u0027Oh, Yulian - I\u0027m bleeding!\u0027\n \u0027Bleed - ?\u0027 He rolled away from her, snatched himself to his feet. Startled, she stared at him standing there. He shivered as if in a fever.\n \u0027Bleeding, yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s perfectly natural, you know.\u0027\n There was no pallor in his face now: it was red with blood, burning like a drunkard\u0027s face, with his eyes narrow slits dark as knife slashes. \u0027Bleeding!\u0027 this time he managed to choke the word out whole. He reached out his arms towards her, hands hooked like claws, and for a moment she thought he would attack her. She could see his nostrils flaring, a nervous tic tugging the corner of his mouth.\n For the first time she felt afraid, felt something of his strangeness. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027It happens every month...\u0027\n His eyes opened up a little. Their pupils seemed flecked with scarlet. A trick of the light. \u0027Ah! Ah - bleeding!\u0027 he said, as though only just understanding her meaning. \u0027Oh, yes...\u0027 Then he reeled, turned away, went a little unsteadily down the steps and was gone. Then Helen had heard the puppy\u0027s wild yelp of joy (it had been stopped by the steps, which it couldn\u0027t climb)\n and its whining and barking fading as it followed Yulian back to the house. And finally she started to breathe again.\n \u0027Yulian!\u0027 she\u0027d called after him then. \u0027Your sunglasses, your hat!\u0027 But if he heard, he didn\u0027t bother to answer.\n She wasn\u0027t able to find him for the rest of the day, but then she hadn\u0027t really looked for him. And because she had her pride - and also because he had failed to seek her out - she hadn\u0027t much bothered with him for the rest of their holiday. Perhaps it had been for the best; for she had been innocent, after all. She wouldn\u0027t have known what to do, not two years ago.\n But when she thought of him, she still remembered his hand burning on her flesh. And now, going back to Devon with the countryside speeding by outside the car, she found herself wondering if there was still straw in the hayloft...\n George, too, had his secret thoughts about Yulian. Anne could say what she liked but she couldn\u0027t change that. He was weird, that lad, and weird in several directions. It wasn\u0027t only the creeping-Jesus aspect that irritated George, though certainly the youth\u0027s furtive ways were annoying enough. But he was sick, too. Not mental, maybe not even sick in his body, just generally sick. To look at him sometimes, to catch him unawares with a side-glance, was to look at a cockroach surprised by a switched-on light, or a jellyfish steaming away, stranded on the beach when the tide goes out. You could almost sense something seething in him. But if it wasn\u0027t mental or physical, and yet encompassed both, then what the hell was it?\n Hard to explain. Maybe it was both mind and body -and soul too? Except George wasn\u0027t much of a one for believing in souls. He didn\u0027t disbelieve, but he would like\n evidence. He\u0027d probably be praying when he died, just in case, but until then...\n As for what Anne had said about Yulian at school: well, it was true, as far as it went. He had taken all of his exams early, and passed every one of them, but that wasn\u0027t why he\u0027d left early. George had a draughtsman, Ian Jones, working for him in his London office, and Jones had a young son in the same school. Anne would hear none of it, of course not, but the stories had been wild. Yulian had \u0027seduced\u0027 a male teacher, a half-way-gone gay he\u0027d somehow switched on. Once over the top, the fellow had apparently turned into a raver, trying to roger every male thing that moved. He\u0027d blamed Yulian. That was one thing. And then:\n In his art classes, Yulian had painted pictures which caused a very gentle lady teacher to attack him physically; she\u0027d also stormed his bed-space and burned his art folios. Out nature rambling (George hadn\u0027t known they still did that) Yulian had been found wandering on his own, his face and hands smeared with filth and entrails. Dangling from one hand he\u0027d carried the remains of a stray kitten. Its carcass was still warm. He\u0027d said a man had done it, but this was out on the moors, miles from anywhere.\n That wasn\u0027t all. It seemed he walked in his sleep and had apparently scared the living shit out of the younger boys, until the school had had to put a night-guard on their dorms. But by then the head had spoken at length with Georgina and she\u0027d agreed he could leave. It was that or expulsion - for the sake of the good name of the school.\n And there\u0027d been other things, lesser things, but that had been the gist of it.\n These were some of the reasons why George didn\u0027t like Yulian. But of course there was one other thing. It was something very nearly as old as Yulian himself, but it had fixed itself in George\u0027s mind indelibly.\n The sight of an old man clutching his sheets to his chest as he died, and his last whispered words: \u0027Christen it? No, no - you mustn\u0027t! First have it exorcised!\u0027\n Anne could be strident if she had to be, but she was good through and through. She would never say a thing to hurt anyone, even though she might think certain things. To herself - if only to herself - she had to admit that she\u0027d thought things about Yulian.\n Now, lying back a little in her seat and stretching, feeling the cooling draught from the half-open window, she thought them again. Funny things: something about a big green frog, and something about the pain she\u0027d get now and then in her left nipple.\n The frog thing was hard to focus on; rather, she didn\u0027t like to focus on it. Personally she couldn\u0027t hurt a fly. Of course a child, a mere five-year old, wouldn\u0027t realise what he was doing. Would he? The trouble was that as long as she\u0027d know Yulian he\u0027d always seemed to know exactly what he was doing. Even as a baby.\n She had called him a \u0027funny little thing\u0027, but in fact George was right. Yulian had been more than just funny. For one thing, he never cried. No, not quite true, he had cried when hungry, at least when he was very small. And he had cried in direct sunlight. Photophobia, apparently, right from infancy. Oh, yes, and he\u0027d cried at least one other time, at his christening. Though that had seemed more rage - or outrage - than crying proper. As far as Anne knew, he never had been properly christened.\n She let her thoughts take hold, carrying her back. Yulian had just started to walk - to toddle, anyway -when Helen came along. That was a month or so before poor Georgina had been well enough to go home and take him back. Anne remembered that time well. She\u0027d been heavy with milk, fat as butter and happier than at any other time in her life. And rosy? What a picture of health she\u0027d been!\n One day when Helen was just six weeks old, while she was feeding her, Yulian had come toddling like a little robot, looking for that extra ounce of affection of which Helen had robbed him. Jealousy even then, yes, for he was no longer all important. On impulse - feeling a pang of pity for the poor mite - she\u0027d picked him up, bared her other breast to him, her left breast, and fed him.\n Even remembering it, the twinge of pain in her nipple came back like a wasp sting to bother her. \u0027Oh!\u0027 she said, stirring where she had fallen half-asleep.\n \u0027You all right?\u0027 George was quick to inquire. \u0027Wind your window down a little more. Get some fresh air.\u0027\n The steady purr of the car\u0027s engine brought her back to the present. \u0027Cramp,\u0027 she lied. \u0027Pins and needles. Can we stop somewhere - the next cafe?\u0027\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 he answered. \u0027There should be one any time now.\u0027\n Anne slumped, returned half-reluctantly to her memories. Feeding Yulian, yes... She\u0027d sat down with both babies, nodded off while they fed, Helen on the right, Yulian on the left. It had been strange; a sort of languor had come over her, a lethargy she hadn\u0027t the will to resist. But then, when the pain came, she\u0027d come quickly awake. Helen had been crying, and Yulian had been - bloody! She\u0027d stared at the toddler in something close to shock. Those peculiar black eyes of his fixed unwaveringly on her face. And his red mouth, fixed like a lamprey on her breast! Her milk and blood had run down the swollen curve of her breast, and his face had been smeared and glistening red with it; so that he\u0027d looked like a dark-eyed gorging leech.\n When she\u0027d cleaned herself up, and cleaned up Yulian too, she\u0027d seen how he\u0027d bitten through the skin around her nipple: his teeth had left tiny punctures. The bites had taken a long time to heal, but their sting had never quite gone away...\n Then there had been the frog episode. Anne didn\u0027t really want to dwell on that, but it formed a persistent picture in her mind, one she couldn\u0027t wipe clear. It had happened after Georgina had sold up in London, on the last day before she and Yulian had left the city and gone down to Devon to live in the old manor house.\n George had built a pond in the garden of their Green-ford home when Helen was one; since when, with a minimum of help, the pond had stocked itself. Now there were lilies, a clump of rushes, an ornamental shrub bending over the water like a Japanese picture, and a large species of green frog. There were water snails, too, and at the edges a little green scum. Anne called it scum, anyway. Mid-summer and there would normally be dragonflies, but that year they\u0027d only seen one or two, and they\u0027d been small ones of their sort.\n She had been in the garden with the children, watching Yulian where he played with a soft rubber ball. Or perhaps \u0027played\u0027 is the wrong word, for Yulian had difficulty playing like other children. He seemed to have a philosophy: a ball is a ball, a rubber sphere. Drop it and it bounces, toss it against a wall and it returns. Other than that it has no practical use, it cannot be considered a source of lasting interest. Others might argue the point, but that summed up Yulian\u0027s feelings on the subject. Anne really didn\u0027t know why she\u0027d bought the ball for him; he never really played with anything. He had bounced it, however, twice. And he\u0027d tossed it against the garden wall, once. But on the rebound it had rolled to the edge of the pond.\n Yulian had followed it with eyes half scornful, until suddenly his interest had quickened. At the edge of the pond something leaped: a large frog, shiny green, poising itself where it landed, with two legs in the water and two on dry land. And the five-year old child froze, becoming still as a cat in the first seconds that it senses prey. It was Helen who ran to retrieve the ball, then skipped away with it up the garden, but Yulian had eyes only for the frog.\n At that point George had called out from inside the house: something about the kebabs burning. They were to be the main course in a farewell meal for Georgina. George was supposed to be doing chef.\n Anne had rushed to save the day, along the crazy-paving, under the arch of roses on their trellis to the paved patio area at the rear of the house. It had taken a minute, two at the outside, to lift the steaming meat from the grill onto a plate on the outdoor table. Then Georgina had come drifting downstairs in that slow get-there-eventually fashion of hers, and George had appeared from the kitchen with his herbs.\n \u0027Sorry, darling,\u0027 he\u0027d apologised. \u0027Timing is everything, and I\u0027m out of practice. But I\u0027ve got it all together now and all\u0027s well...\u0027\n Except that all had not been well.\n Hearing Helen\u0027s cry of alarm from the lower garden, Anne had breathlessly retraced her steps.\n At first, as she reached the pond, Anne hadn\u0027t quite known what she was seeing. She thought Yulian must have fallen face down in the green scum. Then her eyes focussed and the picture firmed. And however much she\u0027d tried to forget it, it had remained firm to this day:\n The tiny white mosaic tiles at the edge of the pond, slimed with blood and guts; and Yulian slimed, too, his face and hands sticky with goo. Cross-legged by the pond like a buddha, Yulian, the frog like a torn green plastic bag in his inexpert hands, slopping its contents. And that child of - of innocence? studying its innards, smelling it, listening to it, apparently astonished by its complexity.\n Then his mother had come wafting up from behind, saying; \u0027Oh dear, oh dear! Was it a live thing? Oh, I see it was. He does that sometimes. Opens things up. Curiosity. To see how they work.\u0027\n And Anne, aghast, snatching up the whining Helen and turning her face away, gasping, \u0027But Georgina, that\u0027s not some old alarm-clock - it\u0027s a frog!\u0027\n \u0027Is it? Is it? Oh dear! Poor thing!\u0027 She\u0027d fluttered her hands. \u0027But it\u0027s a phase he\u0027s going through, that\u0027s all. He\u0027ll grow out of it...\u0027\n And Anne remembered thinking, God, 1 certainly hope so!\n \u0027Devon!\u0027 said George triumphantly, jogging her elbow, startling her. \u0027Did you see the sign, the county boundary? And look, there\u0027s your cafe! Cream teas, fudge, clotted cream! We\u0027ll top the car up, have a bite to eat, and then we\u0027re on the last leg. Peace and quiet for a whole week. Lord, how I can use it... \u0027\n Arriving at the house and turning off the Paignton road into its grounds, the party in the car found Georgina and Yulian waiting for them on the gravel drive. At first they very nearly failed to notice Georgina, for she was over-shadowed by her son. As George stopped the car, Helen\u0027s jaw fell open a little. Anne simply stared. George himself thought, Yulian? Yes, of course it is. But what\u0027s he been doing right?\n Getting out of the car, finally Anne spoke, echoing George\u0027s thoughts.- \u0027Yulian! My, but what a couple of years have done for you!\u0027 He held her briefly, taller by inches, then turned to Helen where she got out of the back seat and stretched.\n \u0027I\u0027m not the only one who has grown,\u0027 he said. His voice was that dark one Helen had heard on a previous occasion, apparently his natural voice now. He held her at arm\u0027s length, stared at her with those unfathomable eyes.\n He\u0027s handsome as the devil, she thought. Or perhaps handsome was the wrong word for it. Attractive, yes -almost unnaturally so. His long, straight chin, not quite lantern-jaw, high brow, straight, flatfish nose - and especially his eyes - all combined to form a face which might seem quite odd on anyone else\u0027s shoulders. But coupled with that voice, and with Yulian\u0027s mind behind it, the effect was quite devastating. He looked somehow foreign, almost alien. His dark hair, flowing naturally back and forming something of a mane at the back of his neck, made him seem even more wolfish than she\u0027d remembered. That was it - wolfish! And he was getting tall as a tree.\n \u0027You\u0027re still slim, anyway,\u0027 she finally found something to say, however uninspired. \u0027But what\u0027s Aunt Georgina been feeding you?\u0027\n He smiled and turned to George, nodded and held out his hand. \u0027George. Did you have a good journey? We\u0027ve worried a little - the roads get so crowded down here in the summer.\u0027\n George! George groaned inwardly. First names, just like with Mummy, hey? Still, it was better than being shied away from.\n \u0027The drive was fine.\u0027 George forced a smile, checking Yulian out but unobtrusively. The youth topped him by a good three inches. Add his hair to that and he looked taller still. Seventeen and already he was a big man. Big-boned, anyway. But give him another stone in weight and\n he\u0027d be like a barn door! Also, his handshake was iron. Hardly limp-wristed, no matter the length of his fingers.\n George was suddenly very much aware of his own thinning hair, his small paunch and slightly stodgy appearance. But at least I can go out in the sun! he thought. Yulian\u0027s pallor was one thing that never changed; even here he stood in the shade of the old house, like part of its shadow.\n But if the last two years had improved Yulian, they\u0027d not been so kind to his mother.\n \u0027Georgina!\u0027 Anne had meanwhile turned to her cousin, hugging her. Beneath the hug she had felt how frail she was, how trembly. The loss of her husband almost eighteen years before was still taking its toll. \u0027And... and looking so well!\u0027\n Liar! George couldn\u0027t help thinking. Well? She looks like something clockwork that\u0027s about wound itself down!\n It was true - Georgina seemed like an automaton. She spoke and moved as if programmed. \u0027Anne, George, Helen - so good to see you all again. So glad you accepted Yulian\u0027s invitation. But come in, come in. You can guess what we\u0027ve got for you, of course. A cream tea, naturally!\u0027\n She led the way, floating light as air, and went inside. Yulian paused at the door, turned and said, \u0027Yes, do come in. Feel free. Enter freely and make yourselves at home.\u0027 The way he said it, somehow ritualistically, made his welcome sound quite odd. As George, at the rear, made to pass him, Yulian added, \u0027Can I bring in your luggage for you?\u0027\n \u0027Why, thanks,\u0027 said George. \u0027Here, I\u0027ll give you a hand.\u0027\n \u0027Not necessary,\u0027 Yulian smiled. \u0027Just give me the keys.\u0027 He opened the boot and took out their cases as if they were empty and weighed nothing. It wasn\u0027t just show, George could see that. Yulian was very strong...\n Following him inside the house, and feeling just a shade useless, George paused on hearing a low growl of warning which came from an open cloakroom in an alcove to one side of the entrance hall. In there, in the deepest shadows behind a dark oak coatstand, something black as sin moved and yellow eyes glared. George looked harder, said, \u0027What in - ?\u0027 and the growling came louder.\n Yulian, half-way down the corridor towards the stairs, turned and looked back. \u0027Oh, don\u0027t let him intimidate you, George. His bark is worse than his bite, I assure you.\u0027 And in a harsher tone of command: \u0027Come, boy, out into the light where we can see you.\u0027\n A black Alsatian, almost full grown, (was this monster really Yulian\u0027s pup?) came slinking into view, baring its teeth at George as it slid by him. The dog went straight to Yulian, stood waiting. George noticed that it didn\u0027t wag its tail.\n \u0027It\u0027s all right, old friend,\u0027 the youth murmured. \u0027You make yourself scarce.\u0027 At which the vicious looking creature moved on into the house.\n \u0027Good Lord!\u0027 said George. \u0027Thank goodness he\u0027s well trained. What\u0027s his name?\u0027\n \u0027Vlad,\u0027 Yulian answered at once, turning away, cases and all. \u0027It\u0027s Romanian, I believe. Means \"Prince\" or something. Or it did in the old times... \u0027\n Yulian wasn\u0027t much visible for the next two or three days. The fact did not especially bother George; if anything he was relieved. Anne merely thought it odd that he wasn\u0027t around; Helen felt he was avoiding her and was annoyed about it, but she didn\u0027t let it show. \u0027What does he do with himself all day?\u0027 Anne asked Georgina, for the sake of something to say, when they were alone together one\n morning.\n Georgina\u0027s eyes seemed constantly dull, but only mention Yulian and they\u0027d take on a startled, almost shocked brightness. Anne mentioned him now - and sure enough, there was that look.\n \u0027Oh, he has his interests...\u0027 She at once tried to change the subject, words tumbling out of her: \u0027We\u0027re thinking about having the old stables down. There are extensive vaults under the grounds - old cellars, wine cellars my grandfather used - and Yulian thinks the stables will crash right through to them one day. If we have them down we\u0027ll sell the stone. It\u0027s good stone and should fetch a decent price.\u0027\n \u0027Vaults? I didn\u0027t know that. You say Yulian goes down there?\u0027\n \u0027To check their condition,\u0027 (more words babbling out of her.) \u0027He worries about maintenance... could collapse, make the house unsafe ... just old corridors, almost like tunnels, and vaults opening off them. Full of nitre, spiders, rotten old wine racks... nothing of interest.\u0027\n Seeing the sudden build-up of her - frenzy? - Anne got up, crossed to Georgina, laid a hand on her frail shoulder. The older woman reacted as if she\u0027d been slapped, jerked away from Anne. Her eyes suddenly focussed. \u0027Anne,\u0027 she said, her voice a shivering whisper, \u0027don\u0027t ask about that place below. And never go down there! It\u0027s not... not safe down there... \u0027\n The Lakes had come down from London on the third Thursday in August. The weather was very hot and showed no sign of letting up. On the Monday Anne and Helen drove off to buy straw sunhats for themselves in Paignton a few miles away. Georgina was having her noontime snooze and Yulian was nowhere to be found.\n George remembered Anne mentioning the vaults under the house: wine cellars, according to Georgina. With nothing better to do he went out, walked round the house to the back, came face to face with a sort of shed built of old stone. He\u0027d noticed it before, had long since concluded that it must be an old, disused outdoor loo and until now had had nothing more to do with it. It had a tiled, sloping roof and a door facing away from the house. Shrubbery grew rank, untended all about. The door was sagging on rotten hinges but George managed to drag it ajar. And squeezing inside, he knew at once that this must be an entrance to the alleged cellars. Narrow stone steps went down steeply on both sides of a ramp perfectly suited for the rolling of barrels. You could find covered delivery points like this in the yard of any old pub. He went carefully down the steps to a door at the bottom, began to push it squealingly open.\n Vald was in there!\n His muzzle came through the first three inches of gap even as George pushed on the door. The snarl of rage preceded it by the merest fraction of a second, and snarl and snout both were the only warning George got. Shocked, he snatched back his hands, and only just in time. The Alsatian\u0027s teeth snapped on the door jamb where his fingers had been, tearing off long splinters of wood. Heart hammering, George leaned on the door, closed it. He\u0027d seen the dog\u0027s eyes and they had looked quite hateful.\n But why would Vlad be down there in the first place? George could only suppose that Yulian had put him there to keep him out of the way while guests were around. A wise move, for obviously Vlad\u0027s bark was not as bad as his bite! Maybe Yulian was down there with him. Well, they were a duo George could well do without...\n Feeling shaken, he left the grounds and walked half a mile down the road to a pub at the crossroads. On the way, surrounded by fields and lanes, birdsong and the\n normal, entirely pleasant hum of insects in the hedgerows, his nerves slowly recovered. The sun was hot and by the time he reached his destination he was ready for a drink.\n The pub was ancient, thatched, all oak beams and horse-brasses, with a gently ticking grandfather clock and a massive white cat overhanging its own chair. After Vlad, George could stand cats well enough. He ordered a lager, perched himself on a barstool.\n There were others in the bar: a fashionable young couple seated well away from George at a corner table close to small-paned windows, who doubtless owned the little sports job he\u0027d seen parked in the yard; local youths in another corner, playing dominoes; and two old-timers deep in conversation over their pints at a table close by. It was the muttered, lowered tones of this latter pair which attracted him. Sipping his ice-cold lager and after the bartender had moved on to other tasks, George thought he heard the word \u0027Harkley\u0027 and his ears pricked up. Harkley House was Georgina\u0027s place.\n \u0027Oh, ar? That \u0027un up there, hey? A funny \u0027un, I\u0027m told.\u0027\n \u0027Course there ain\u0027t a jot o\u0027 proof, but she\u0027d bin seen wi\u0027 \u0027im, right enough. An\u0027 clean off Sharkham Point she went, down Brixham way. Terrible!\u0027\n A local tragedy, obviously, thought George. The Point was a headland of cliffs projecting into the sea. He glanced at the two old-timers, nodded and had his nod returned, turned back to his drink. But their conversation stayed with him. One of them was thin, ferret-faced, the other red and portly, the latter doing the story-telling.\n Now he continued, \u0027Carryin\u0027, o\u0027 course.\u0027\n \u0027Pregnant, were she?\u0027 the thin one gasped. \u0027It were \u0027is, you reckon?\u0027\n \u0027I reckons nuthin\u0027,\u0027 the first denied. \u0027No proof, like I said. An\u0027 anyway, she were a rum \u0027un. But so young. \u0027Tis a pity.\u0027\n \u0027A pity\u0027s right,\u0027 the thin one agreed. \u0027But ter jump like that... what made \u0027er do it, d\u0027you think? I mean, unwed an\u0027 carryin\u0027 these days ain\u0027t nuthin.\n Out of the corner of his eye, George saw them lean closer. Their voices fell lower still and he strained to hear what was said:\n \u0027I reckon,\u0027 said the portly one, \u0027that Nature told \u0027er it weren\u0027t right. You know \u0027ow a ewe\u0027ll cast a puggled lamb? Suthin\u0027 like that, poor lass.\u0027\n \u0027It weren\u0027t right, you say? They opened \u0027er up, then?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, ar, they did that! Tide were out an\u0027 she knew it. She weren\u0027t goin\u0027 in the water, that one. She were goin\u0027 down on the rocks! Makin\u0027 sure, she were. Now \u0027ere, strictly \u0027tween you an\u0027 me, my girl Mary\u0027s at the hospital, as you know. She says that when they brung \u0027er in she were dead as mutton. But they sounded \u0027er belly, and it were still kickin\u0027... !\u0027\n After a moment\u0027s pause: \u0027The child?\u0027\n \u0027Well what else, you old fool! So they opened \u0027er up. \u0027Orrible it were - but there\u0027s none but a handful knows of it, so this stops right \u0027ere. Well, doctor took one look at it an\u0027 put a needle in it. He just finished it there and then. An\u0027 into a plastic bag it went an\u0027 down to the hospital furnace. An\u0027 that was that.\u0027\n \u0027Deformed,\u0027 the thin one nodded. \u0027I\u0027ve heard o\u0027 such.\u0027\n \u0027Well, this one weren\u0027t so much deformed as ... as not much formed at all!\u0027 the florid one informed. \u0027It were -\u0027ow\u0027d my Mary put it? - like some kind of massive tumour in \u0027er. A terrible sort of fleshy lump, and fibrous. But it were s\u0027posed to \u0027ave been a child, for there was afterbirth and all. But for sure it were better off dead! My Mary said as \u0027ow there was eyes where there shouldn\u0027t be, an\u0027 things like teeth, an\u0027 \u0027ow it mewled suthin\u0027 terrible when the light fell on it!\u0027\n George had finished his lager, the last of it with a gulp.\n The door of the pub was flung open and a party of young people came in. Another moment and one of them had found a juke-box in some hidden alcove; rock music washed over everything. The barman came back, pulled pints for all he was worth.\n George left, headed back down the road. Half-way back, his car pulled up and Anne shouted, \u0027Get in the back.\u0027\n She wore a straw hat with a wide black band, contrasting perfectly with her summer dress. Helen, sitting beside her, wore one with a red band. \u0027How\u0027s that?\u0027 Anne laughed as George plumped down in the back seat and slammed the door. Mother and daughter tilted their heads coquettishly, showed off their hats. \u0027Just like a couple of village girls out for a drive, eh?\u0027\n \u0027Around here,\u0027 George answered darkly, \u0027village girls need to watch what they\u0027re doing.\u0027 But he didn\u0027t explain his meaning, and in any case he wouldn\u0027t have mentioned Harkley in the same breath as the story he\u0027d overheard in the pub. He took it that he\u0027d simply misinterpreted the first few words. However that may be, the unpleasantness of the thing stayed with him for the rest of the day.\n The next morning, Tuesday, George was up late. Anne had offered him breakfast in bed but he\u0027d declined, gone back to sleep. He got up at ten to a quiet house, made himself a small breakfast that turned out quite tasteless. Then, in the living-room, he found Anne\u0027s note:\n Darling -\n Yulian and Helen are out walking Vlad. I think I\u0027ll drive Georgina into town and buy her something. We\u0027ll be back for lunch -\n Anne\n George sighed his frustration, chewed his bottom lip angrily. This morning he\u0027d meant to have a quick look at the cellars, just out of curiosity. Yulian could have perhaps shown him around down there. As for the rest of the day: he\u0027d planned on driving the girls to the beach at Salcombe; a day by the sea might fetch Georgina out of herself. The salty air would be good for Helen, too, who\u0027d been looking a bit peaky. Just like Anne to get cab-happy with the car the minute they were out of London!\n Ah, well - maybe there\u0027d still be time for the beach this afternoon. But what to do with himself this morning? A walk into Old Paignton, to the harbour, perhaps? It would be a fair bit of a walk, but he could always drop in somewhere for a pint along the way. And later, if he was tired or pushed for time, he\u0027d simply come back by taxi.\n George did exactly that. He took his binoculars with him and spent a little time gazing at near-distant Brixham across the bay, returned to Harkley by taxi at about 12.30 and paid the driver off at the gate. He\u0027d enjoyed both the long walk and his glass of cold beer enormously, and it seemed he\u0027d timed the entire expedition just perfectly for lunch.\n Then, wandering up the drive where the curving gravel path came closest to the copse - a densely grown stand of beech, birch and alder, with one mighty cedar towering slightly apart - there he came across his car, its front doors standing open and the keys still in the ignition. George stared at the car in mild surprise, turned in a slow circle and glanced all about.\n The copse had an overgrown crazy-paving path winding through its heart, and a once-elegant white three-bar fence running round it - like a wood in a book of fairy tales. The fence was leaning now and very much off-white, with rank growth sprung up on both sides. George looked in that direction but could see no one. Tall grasses and brambles, the tops of fenceposts, trees. And...\n maybe something big and black moving furtively in the undergrowth? Vlad?\n It could well be that Anne, Helen, Georgina and Yulian were all walking together in the copse; certainly it would be leafy and cool under the canopy of the trees. But if it was only Yulian and the dog in there, or the bloody dog on his own...\n Suddenly it came to George that he feared one as much as the other. Yes, feared them. Yulian wasn\u0027t like any other person he knew, and Vlad wasn\u0027t like any other dog. There was something wrong with both of them. And in the middle of a quiet, hot summer day George shivered.\n Then he got a grip of himself. Frightened? Of a queer, freakish youth and a three-quarters grown dog? Ridiculous!\n He gave a loud \u0027Hallooo!\u0027 - and got no answer.\n Irritated now, his previously pleasant mood rapidly waning, he hurried to the house. Inside ... no one! He went through the old place slamming doors, finally climbed the stairs to his and Anne\u0027s bedroom. Where the hell was everyone? And why had Anne left his car there like that? Was he to spend the entire day on his bloody own?\n From his bedroom window he could see most of the grounds at the front of the house right to the gate. The barn and huddled stables interfered with the view of the copse, but -\n George\u0027s attention was suddenly riveted by a splash of colour showing in the tall grass this side of the fence where it circled the copse. It caught his attention and held it. He moved a fraction, tried to see beyond the projecting gables of the old barn. It wouldn\u0027t come into focus. Then he remembered his binoculars, still hanging round his neck. He quickly put them to his eyes, adjusted them.\n Still the gables intervened, and he\u0027d got the range\n wrong. The splash of colour was still there - a dress? -but a flesh-pink tone was moving against it. Moving insistently. With viciously impatient hands, George finally got the range right, brought the picture close. The splash of summer colours was a dress, yes. And the flesh-coloured tone was - flesh! Naked flesh.\n George scanned the scene disbelievingly. They were in the grass. He couldn\u0027t see Helen - not her face, anyway -for she was face down, backside in the air. And Yulian mounting her, frantic in his rage, his passion, his hands gripping her waist. George began to tremble and he couldn\u0027t stop it. Helen was a willing party to this, had to be. Well, and he\u0027d said she was an adult - but God! -there must be limits.\n And there she was, face down in the grass, naked as a baby - George\u0027s baby girl - with her straw hat and her dress tossed aside and her pink flesh open to this... this slime! George no longer feared Yulian, if he ever had, but hated him. The weird-looking bastard would look a sight weirder when he was finished with him.\n He snatched his binoculars from his neck, tossed them down on the bed, turned towards the door - and his muscles locked rigid. George\u0027s jaw fell open. Something he had seen, some monstrous thing burned on his mind\u0027s eye. With hands numb to the bone he took up the binoculars, fixed them again on the couple in the long grass. Yulian had finished, lay sprawled alongside his partner. But George let the glasses slide right over them to the hat and disarrayed dress.\n The straw hat had a wide black band. It was Anne\u0027s hat. And now that fact had dawned he saw that it was also Anne\u0027s dress.\n The binoculars slipped from George\u0027s fingers. He staggered, almost fell, flopped down heavily on his bed. On their bed, his and Anne\u0027s. Willing party... had to\n be. The words kept repeating in his whirling head. He couldn\u0027t believe what he\u0027d seen, but he had to believe. And she was a willing party. Had to be.\n How long he sat there in a daze he couldn\u0027t tell: five minutes, ten? But finally he came out of it. He came out of it, shook himself, knew what he must do. All those stories from Yulian\u0027s school: they must be true. The bastard was a pervert! But Anne, what of Anne?\n Could she be drunk? Or drugged? That was it! Yulian must have given her something.\n George stood up. He was cold now, cold as ice. His blood boiled but his mind was a white snowfield, with the track he must take clearly delineated. He looked at his hands and felt the strength of both God and the devil flowing in them. He would tear out the black, soulless eyes of that swine; he would eat his rotten heart!\n He staggered downstairs, through the empty house, reeled drunkenly, murderously towards the copse. And he found Anne\u0027s hat and dress exactly where he\u0027d seen them. But no Anne, no Yulian. Blood pounded in George\u0027s temples; hate like acid corroded his mind, peeling away every layer of rationality. Still reeling, he scrambled his way through low brambles to the gravel drive, glared his loathing at the house. Then something told him to look behind. Back there, at the gates, Vlad stood watching, then started forward uncertainly.\n Something of sanity returned. George hated Yulian now, intended to kill him if he could, but he still feared the dog. There\u0027d always been something about dogs, and especially this one. He ran back towards the house, and coming round a screen of bushes saw Yulian striding through the shrubbery towards the rear of the building. Towards the entrance to the cellars.\n \u0027Yulian!\u0027 George tried to yell, but the word came out as a gasping croak. He didn\u0027t try again. Why warn the perverted little sod? Behind him, Vlad put on a little speed, began to lope.\n At the corner of the house George paused for a moment, gulped air desperately. He was out of condition. Then he saw a rusty old mattock leaning against the wall and snatched it up. A glance over his shoulder told him that Vlad was coming, his strides stretching now, ears flat to -his head. George wasted no more time but plunged through the low shrubbery to the entrance to the vaults. And there stood Yulian at the open door. He heard George coming, turned his head and cast a startled glance his way.\n \u0027Ah, George!\u0027 He smiled a sickly smile. \u0027I was just wondering if perhaps you\u0027d like to see the cellars?\u0027 Then he saw George\u0027s expression, the mattock in his white-knuckled hands.\n \u0027The cellars?\u0027 George choked, almost entirely deranged with hatred. \u0027Yes I fucking would!\u0027 He swung his pick-like weapon. Yulian put up an arm to shield his face, turned away. The sharper, rustier blade of the heavy tool took him in the back of his right shoulder, crunched through the lower part of the scapula and buried itself to the haft in his body.\n Thrown forward, Yulian went toppling down the central ramp, the mattock still sticking in him. As he fell he said, \u0027Ah! Ah!\u0027 - in no way a scream, more an expression of surprise, shock. George followed, arms reaching, lips drawn back from his teeth. He pursued Yulian, and Vlad pursued him.\n Yulian lay face down at the bottom of the steps beside the open door to the vaults. He moaned, moved awkwardly. George slammed a foot down in the middle of his back, levered the mattock out of him. \u0027Ah! Ah!\u0027 again Yulian gave his peculiar, sighing cry. George lifted the mattock - and heard Vlad\u0027s rumbling growl close behind.\n He turned, swung the mattock in a deadly arc. The dog was stopped in mid-flight as the mattock smacked flatly against the side of its head. It crumpled to the concrete floor, groaned like a man. George panted hoarsely, lifted his weapon again - but there was no sign of consciousness in the animal. Its sides heaved but it lay still, tongue protruding. Out like a light.\n And now there was only Yulian.\n George turned, saw Yulian staggering into the vault\u0027s unknown darkness. Unbelievable! With his injury, still the bastard kept going. George followed, kept Yulian\u0027s stumbling figure visible in the gloom. The cellars were extensive, rooms and alcoves and midnight corridors, but George didn\u0027t let his quarry out of sight for a single moment. Then - a light!\n George peered through an arched entrance into a dimly illumined room. A single dusty bulb, shaded, hung from a vaulted ceiling of stone blocks. George had momentarily lost sight of Yulian in the darkness surrounding the cone of light; but then the youth staggered between him and the light source, and George picked him up again and advanced. Yulian saw him, swung an arm wildly at the light in an attempt to put it out of commission. Injured, he missed his aim, setting the lamp and shade dancing and swinging on their flex.\n Then, by that wildly gyrating light, George saw the rest of the room. In intermittent flashes of light and darkness, he picked out the details of the hell he\u0027d walked into.\n Light... and in one corner a glimpse of piled wooden racks and cobwebbed shelving. Darkness... and Yulian an even darker shape that crouched uncertainly in the centre of the room. Light - and along one wall Georgina, seated in an old cane chair, her eyes bulging but vacant and her mouth and flaring nostrils wide as yawning caverns. Darkness - and a movement close by, so that George put up the mattock to defend himself. Insane light - and to his right a huge copper vat, six feet across and seated on copper legs; with Helen slumped in a dining chair on one side, her back to the nitre-streaked wall, and Anne, naked, likewise positioned on the other side. Their inner arms dangling inside the rim of the bowl, and something in the bowl itself seeming to move restlessly, throwing up ropes of doughy matter. Flickering darkness - out of which came Yulian\u0027s laughter: the clotted, sick laughter of someone warped irreparably. Then light again - which found George\u0027s eyes fixed on the great vat, or more properly on the women. And the picture searing itself indelibly into his brain.\n Helen\u0027s clothing ripped down the front and pulled back, and the girl lolling there like a slut with her legs sprawled open, everything displayed. Anne likewise; but both of them grimacing, their faces working hideously, showing alternating joy and total horror; their arms in the vat, and the nameless slime crawling on their arms to their shoulders, pulsating from its unknown source!\n Merciful darkness - and the thought in George\u0027s tottering mind: God! It\u0027s feeding on them, and it\u0027s feeding itself to them! And Yulian so close now that he could hear his rasping breathing. Light again, as the lamp settled to a jerky jitterbug - and the mattock wrenched from George\u0027s nerveless fingers and hurled away. And George finally face to visage with the man he\u0027d intended to kill, who now he discovered to be hardly a man at all but something out of his very worst nightmares.\n Fingers of rubber with the strength of steel gripped his shoulder and propelled him effortlessly, irresistibly towards the vat. \u0027George,\u0027 the nightmare gurgled almost conversationally, \u0027I want you to meet something...\u0027\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-ii-wamphyri-necroscope-2/page-5.html","bookId":2117,"book":{"id":2117,"title":"Necroscope II: Wamphyri (Necroscope #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The spirit of Harry Keogh now resides in his son, Harry Jr. When his infant son sleeps, Harry can roam the Continuum and speak to the dead, but is gradually losing his control as the son \"reels\" his father\u0027s spirit back in.
