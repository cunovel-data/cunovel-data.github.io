{"id":92840,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"The voice of the extinct vampire faded in Harry Keogh\u0027s incorporeal mind. For long moments nothing further was said, and they were empty seconds which Harry couldn\u0027t really afford. At any moment he could find himself recalled by his infant son, back through the maze of the M\u0026ouml;bius continuum to the garret flat in Hartlepool. But if Harry\u0027s time was important, so too was the rest of mankind\u0027s.\n \u0027I begin to feel sorry for you, Thibor,\u0027 he said, his life-force burning blue as a neon firefly in the dark glade under the trees. \u0027I can see how you fought against it, how you did not want to become what you eventually became.\u0027\n Eventually? the old Thing in the ground spoke up at last. No eventually about it, Harry - I had become! From the moment Faethor\u0027s seed embraced my body, my brain, I was doomed. For from that moment it was growing in me, and growing quickly. First its effect became apparent in my emotions, my passions. I say \u0027apparent\u0027, but scarcely so to me. Can you feel your body healing after a cut or a blow? Are you aware of your hair or fingernails growing? Does a man who gradually becomes insane know that he is going mad?\n Suddenly, as the voice of the vampire faded again, there came a rising babble in Harry\u0027s mind. A cry of frustration, of fury! He had expected it sooner or later, for he knew that Thibor Ferenczy was not alone here in the dark cruciform hills. And now a new voice formed words in the necroscope\u0027s consciousness, a voice he recognised of old.\n You old liar! You old devil! cried the inflamed spark, the enraged spirit of Boris Dragosani. Ah! And how is this for irony? Not enough that I am dead, but to have for companion in my grave that one creature I loathed above all others! And worse, to know that my greatest enemy in life - the man who killed me - is now the only living man who can ever reach me in death! Ha, ha! And to be here, knowing once more the voices of these two - the one demanding, the other wheedling, beguiling, seeking to lie as always - and knowing the futility of it all; but yet yearning, burning to be... involved! Oh, God, if ever there were a God, won\u0027t - somebody - speak - to - meeeee?!\n Pay no attention, said Thibor at once. He raves. For, as you well know, Harry, since you were instrumental, when he killed me he killed himself. The thought is enough to unhinge anyone, and poor Boris was half-mad to begin with .\n I was made mad! Dragosani howled. By a filthy, lying, loathsome leech of a thing in the ground! Do you know what he did to me, Harry Keogh?\n \u0027I know of several things he did to you,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027Mental and physical torture seems an unending activity for creatures of your sort, alive or dead. Or undead!\u0027\n You are right, Harry! A third voice from beyond the grave now spoke up. It was a soft, whispering voice, but not without a certain sinister inflection. They are cruel beyond words, and none of them is to be trusted! I assisted Dragosani; I was his friend; it was my finger which triggered the bolt that struck Thibor through the heart and pinned him there, half-in, half-out of his grave. Why, I was the one who handed Dragosani the scythe to cut off the monster\u0027s head! And how did he pay me, eh? Ah, Dragosani! How can you talk of lies and treachery and loathsomeness, when you yourself - You - were - a - monster! Dragosani silenced Max\n Batu\u0027s accusations with one of his own. My excuse is simple: I had Thibor\u0027s vampire seed in me. But what of you, Max? What? A man so evil he could kill with a glance?\n Batu, a Mongol esper who in life had held the secret of the Evil Eye, was outraged. Now hear this great liar, this thief.\u0027 he hissed sibilantly. He slit my throat, drained my blood, despoiled my corpse and tore from it my secret. He took my power for his own, to kill as I killed. Hah! Little good it did him. Now we share the same gloomy hillside. Aye, Thibor, Dragosani, and myself, and all three of us shunned by the teeming dead.\n \u0027Listen to me, all of you,\u0027 said Harry, before they could start again. \u0027So you\u0027ve all suffered injustices, eh? Well, maybe you have, but none so great as those you\u0027ve worked. How many men did you kill with your Evil Eye, Max, stopping them dead in their tracks and crumpling their hearts like paper? And were they all bad men? Did they deserve to die? As horribly as that? No, for one at least was my friend, as good a man as you could ever wish to meet.\u0027\n The head of your British E-Branch? Batu was quick off the mark. But Dragosani ordered me to kill him!\n It was our mission! Dragosani railed. Don\u0027t play the innocent here, Mongol. You\u0027d killed others before him.\n He also ordered Ladislau Giresci killed, said Batu. One of his own countrymen, and entirely innocent! Ah, but Giresci knew Dragosani\u0027s secret - that he was a vampire!\n He was a danger to... to the State! Dragosani blustered. I worked only for Mother Russia, and - \u0027You worked only for yourself!\u0027 Harry stopped him.\n \u0027The truth is, you desired to be a power in the land. No, in the whole world! Lie if you must, Dragosani, for it\u0027s a trait of vampires, after all, but not to yourself. I\u0027ve spoken to Gregor Borowitz, remember? And did he too die for Mother Russia? The head of your own E-Branch?\u0027\n There you have it, Dragosani, said Thibor, his voice a dark chuckle. Caught on your own barbs!\n \u0027Don\u0027t crow, Thibor,\u0027 Harry\u0027s voice was lower still. \u0027You were as bad and probably worse than both of them.\u0027\n I? Why, I have - or I had - lain here in the earth for five hundred years! What harm can a poor thing in the ground do, alone with the worms in the cold hard earth?\n \u0027And what of the five hundred years before that?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027You know as well as I that Wallachia trembled to your tread for centuries! The earth itself is soaked black with the blood you spilled. And don\u0027t lay it all at Faethor Ferenczy\u0027s feet. He\u0027s not entirely to blame. He knew what you were, else he wouldn\u0027t have chosen you. .\n And is that why you\u0027ve come? Thibor asked after a moment. To harangue and accuse and denounce?\n \u0027No, I came to learn,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Now look, I can\u0027t lie as well as you do. I was never much of a liar at the best of times. So I\u0027m sure you\u0027d see through me if I tried any sort of subterfuge. That\u0027s why I\u0027ll come straight out with it . .\n Well then? said Dragosani. Out with it, if you will.\n Harry ignored him, was silent for a few seconds. \u0027Thibor,\u0027 he said at last, \u0027a moment ago you asked what harm you\u0027d done, buried here these last five hundred years.\u0027\n I can tell you what harm he did! Dragosani would not be ignored. Only look at me! I was an innocent child and he taught me the arts of necromancy. Later, as a youth, he beguiled me with his hypnotism and his lies. As a man he put his vampire egg in me, and when it had matured, he - \u0027Your history concerns me not at all!\u0027 Harry stopped him. \u0027Neither that nor any calumny of charges you bring against Thibor or anyone else.\u0027\n Calumny? Dragosani was furious.\n \u0027Be quiet!\u0027 Harry\u0027s patience had broken. \u0027Be quiet now, or I leave you at once, immediately, to wait out all the ages in your loneliness. All three of you.\u0027\n There was a sullen silence.\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Now, as I was saying, I\u0027m not greatly concerned with Thibor\u0027s crimes or supposed crimes against you, Boris Dragosani. No, but I am concerned to know about what he did to another. I refer to a woman, Georgina Bodescu, who came here with her husband one winter. There was an accident and the man died. He died here, on this very spot. She was pregnant and fainted at the sight of his blood. And afterwards. .\n Ah? said Thibor, his interest quickening. But I\u0027ve already told you that story. Are you telling me now that\n are you saying it took effect?\n Beware, Harry Keogh! Dragosani interrupted. Tell him no more. I heard the tale, too, when the old liar told it to you. If that unborn child as was is now a man, he\u0027ll be in thrall to Thibor! Aye, even though his master\u0027s dead! Can\u0027t you see? This devil would see himself alive again - in the body and mind of this new disciple!\n You... dog! Thibor howled. You are Wamphyri! Does that mean nothing to you? We may fight among ourselves, but we do not divulge our secrets to others! You are damned for all time, Dragosani!\n Old fool, I\u0027m that already! Dragosani snarled.\n \u0027Very well then,\u0027 Harry sighed. \u0027I can see I\u0027m wasting precious time. That being the case, I\u0027ll bid you - \u0027\n Wait! Thibor\u0027s voice was all burning anguish. You can\u0027t tell me just so much and leave it at that. That\u0027s . .\n inhuman!\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Harry snorted.\n A trade, then. I shall finish my story, and you shall tell me if the child was born and lives. And... how he lives. Agreed?\n Harry guessed he\u0027d said too much already, which in itself might be as good a reason as any for going on. There were now four principal things he must try to discover. One: the full range of a vampire\u0027s powers. Two: how, exactly, Thibor might try to use Yulian Bodescu. For Dragosani seemed to think it was possible for Thibor to resurrect himself, in Bodescu. Three: the rest of Thibor\u0027s story concerning the occurrences a thousand years ago at the castle of Faethor Ferenczy, so that he might know if anything of evil yet remained in that place. And four:\n how to kill a vampire, but definitely!\n As to the last: Harry had thought he knew that much eight months ago, when he\u0027d waged war on the Ch\u0026acirc;teau Bronnitsy. But looking back now he saw that Dragosani\u0027s death had only come about through a fortunate combination of events. For one thing Dragosani had been blinded: his eyes had been ruined by a reflected mind-bolt when Max Batu\u0027s stolen talent had rebounded on him from one of Harry\u0027s zombies; for of course Harry had had his zombie Tartars, his shock troops, for back-up in that affray. It had been one of them, called up from the preserving peat, who\u0027d hacked Dragosani\u0027s head from his shoulders; and another who\u0027d pinned his parasite vampire to his chest with a wooden stake when it deserted his shattered body. Harry couldn\u0027t have done all of these things, maybe not any of them, on his own. In fact, Harry\u0027s only real ace had been his mastery of the M\u0026ouml;bius continuum: when he\u0027d been very nearly cut in half by machinegun fire, he\u0027d fled his dying body and dragged Dragosani\u0027s mind in there with him. In the M\u0026ouml;bius continuum he\u0027d hurled Dragosani through a past-time door, which had led the necromancer back to Thibor in his grave. And there an \u0027earlier\u0027 Dragosani had lured up and killed Thibor, never dreaming that with the same stroke he had also determined his own fate. As for Harry\u0027s incorporeal mind: he\u0027d gone forward, found his son\u0027s life-thread and joined with it, lay with it in the womb of Brenda waiting to be born. She had been his lover, his wife, and now, in a way, might even be considered his mother. His second mother.\n But what if he had left Dragosani\u0027s mind in his corpse back at the Ch\u0026acirc;teau? How long would that broken body have stayed a corpse? That was conjectural .\n And Harry wondered: how had the surviving Russian E-Branch members dealt with what remained when all the fighting stopped? What had they made of his zombies? It must have seemed utter madness, an absolute nightmare! Harry supposed that after he left the Ch\u0026acirc;teau along the Mobius way, the Tartars had fallen once more into quiescence .\n Perhaps by now Alec Kyle had the answers to these questions, learned from Felix Krakovitch. Harry would find out eventually, but for now there were fresh problems. Foremost among them: how much dare he tell Thibor about Yulian Bodescu? Very little, he supposed. But, on the other hand, by now the extinct vampire had probably guessed all of it for himself. Which made any continued secrecy pointless.\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Harry, finally, \u0027we trade.\u0027\n Fool! Dragosani cut in at once. I had given you some credit, Harry Keogh - I thought you were cleverer than that. And yet here you are attempting to bargain with the devil himself! I see now that I was unlucky in our little contest. You are as big a fool as I was!\n Harry ignored him. \u0027The rest of your story then, Thibor, and quickly. For I don\u0027t know how much time I have...\u0027\n The first time the old Ferenczy came, I was not ready for him. I was asleep; but exhausted, half-starved, it\u0027s unlikely I could have done anything anyway. The first I knew of his visit was when I heard the heavy oaken door slam, and a bar was dropped into place outside. Four trussed chickens, alive, full-feathered, squawked and fluttered in a basket just inside the door. As I roused myself and went to the door, Ehrig was a pace ahead of me.\n I caught him by the shoulder, threw him aside, got to the basket first. \u0027What\u0027s this, Faethor?\u0027 I cried. \u0027Chickens? I thought we vampires supped on richer meat!\u0027\n \u0027We sup on blood!\u0027 he called back, chuckling a little beyond the door. \u0027On coarse meat if and when we must, but the blood is the true life. The fowl are for you, Thibor. Tear out their throats and drink well. Squeeze them dry. Give the carcasses to Ehrig, if it please you, and what\u0027s left goes to your \"cousin\" under the flags.\u0027\n I heard him starting up stone steps, called out: \u0027Faethor, when do I take up my duties? Or perhaps you\u0027ve changed your mind and deem it too dangerous to let me out?\u0027\n His footsteps paused. \u0027I\u0027ll let you out when I\u0027m ready,\u0027 his muffled voice came back. \u0027And when you are ready. .\n He chuckled again, but more deeply in his throat this time.\n \u0027Ready? I\u0027m ready for better treatment than this!\u0027 I told him. \u0027You should have brought me a girl. You can do more with a girl than just eat her!\u0027\n For a moment there was silence, then he said, \u0027When you are your own master you may take what you like.\u0027 His voice was colder. \u0027But I am not some mother cat to fetch fat mice for her kittens. A girl, a boy, a goat - blood is blood, Thibor. As for lust: you\u0027ll have time for that later, when you understand the real meaning of the word. For now... save your strength.\u0027 And then he moved on.\n Ehrig had meanwhile taken hold of the basket, was sidling off with it. I gave him a cl6ut which knocked him protesting to the floor. Then I looked at the terrified birds and scowled. But... I was hungry and meat is meat. I had never been a squeamish one, and these birds were plump. And anyway, the vampire in me was taking the edge off all points of mannered custom and nicety and civilised behaviour. As for civilisation: what was that to me? A Wallach warrior, I had always been two-thirds barbarian!\n I ate, and so did the dog Ehrig. Aye, and later, when next we slept, so did my \u0027cousin\u0027 .\n The next time I came awake - more strongly, surging awake, refreshed from my meal - I saw the Thing, that mindless being of vampire flesh which hid in the dark earth under the floor. I do not know what I had expected. Faethor had mentioned vines, creepers in the earth. That is what it was like. Partly, anyway.\n If you have seen a squashy octopus from the sea, then you have seen something like the creature spawned of the finger which Faethor shed, fattened on the flesh of Arvos the gypsy. The one thing I cannot comment upon was its size; however, if a man\u0027s body were flattened to a doughy mass... it would spread a long way. The matter of Arvos had been reshaped.\n Certainly the groping \u0027hands\u0027 which the being put up were stretchy things. There were also many of them, and they were not lacking in strength. Its eyes were very strange: they formed and unformed, came and went; they ogled and blinked; but in all truth I cannot say that they saw. Indeed, I had the feeling they were blind. Or perhaps they saw in the way a newborn infant sees, without understanding.\n When one of the thing\u0027s hands came up from the soil close to where I lay, I cursed out loud and kicked it away - and how it shot down out of sight then! How well another might fare I could not say, but the vampire thing was certainly wary of me. Perhaps it sensed that I was a higher form - of itself! I remember how at the time, that was a very shuddersome thought.\n Faethor had this way with him: he was devious, sly as a fox, slippery as an eel. That was how I considered him, feelings brought on by sheer frustration. Of course he was that way: he was of the Wamphyri! I should not have expected him to be any other way. But quite simply, he would not be ambushed. I spent hours waiting for him behind the oak door, chains in my hands, hardly daring to breathe lest he hear me. But let hell freeze over, he would not come. Ah! But only let me fall asleep... a squealing piglet would wake me, or the fluttering of a tethered pigeon. And so the days, probably weeks, passed .\n I will give him his due: after that first time the old devil didn\u0027t let me get too hungry. I think to myself now that the initial period of starvation was to let the vampire in me take hold. It had nothing else to feed on and so must rely on my stored fats, must become more fully a part of me. Similarly, I was obliged to draw on its strength. But as soon as the bond was properly formed, then Faethor could begin to fatten us up again. And I use that phrase advisedly.\n Along with the food, there would be the occasional jug of red wine. At first, remembering how the Ferenczy had drugged me, I was careful. I would let Ehrig drink first, then watch for his reaction. But apart from a loosening of his tongue, there was nothing. And so I too drank. Later I would give Ehrig none of the wine but consume it myself. That, too, was exactly the way the old devil had planned it.\n Came the time when, after a meal, I was thirsty and quaffed a jug at one swig - then staggered this way and that before collapsing. Poisoned again! Faethor had made a fool of me at every turn. But this time my vampire strength buoyed me up; I held fast to my consciousness, and sprawling there in my fever I wondered: now what is the purpose of this? Hah! Only listen, and I\u0027ll explain Faethor\u0027s purpose.\n \u0027A girl, a boy, a goat - blood is blood,\u0027 he\u0027d told me that time. \u0027The blood is the life.\u0027 Indeed, but what he had not told me was this: that of all pulses of delight, of all founts of immortality, of all nectar-bearing flowers, that one source from which a vampire would most prefer to sip is the throbbing red rush of another vampire\u0027s blood! And so, when I had succumbed more fully to his wine, then Faethor came to me again.\n \u0027Two purposes are served here,\u0027 he told me, crouching over me. \u0027One: it is long and long since I took from one of my own, and a great thirst is on me. Two: you are a hard one and will not submit to thraldom without a fight. So be it, this should take all of the sting out of you.\u0027\n \u0027What... what are you doing?\u0027 I croaked the question, tried to will my leaden arms to rise up and fend him off. It was useless; I was weak as a kitten; even my throat found the greatest difficulty simply forming words.\n \u0027Doing? Why, I sit me down to my evening meal!\u0027 he answered, gleefully. \u0027And such a menu! Blood of a strong man - spiced with the blood of the fledgling vampire within him!\u0027\n \u0027You... you\u0027ll drink from... from my throat?\u0027 I stared up at him aghast, my vision swimming.\n He merely smiled - but a smile hideous as any I ever saw him make - and tore my clothes. Then he put his terrible tapering hands on me and felt my flesh all over, frowning a little as he searched for something. He turned me on my side, touched my spine, pressed it again, harder, and said, \u0027Ah! The very gobbet, the prize itself!\u0027\n I would have cringed away from him but could not. Inside I cringed - perhaps that child of his within me cringed, too - but externally my skin merely shivered. I tried to speak, but that also had grown too difficult. My lips only trembled and I made a moaning sound.\n \u0027Thibor,\u0027 the old devil said, his voice level as if in polite conversation, \u0027you\u0027ve much to learn, my son. About me, about yourself, about the Wamphyri. You are not yet aware, you fail to perceive all the mysteries I have bestowed upon you. But what I am, you shall be. And the powers I possess, they too shall be yours. You have seen and learned a little, now see and experience more!\u0027\n He continued to balance me on my side, but propped up my head a little so that I could see his face. His magnetic eyes held me, a fish, speared on their pupils. My blurred sight cleared; the picture sharpened; I saw more clearly than ever before. My body and limbs might well be made of lead, but my mind was sharp as a knife, my awareness so keen that I could almost feel the change taking place in the creature who leaned over me. Faethor had somehow, for some reason, heightened my perceptions, increased my sensitivity.\n \u0027Now watch,\u0027 he hissed. \u0027Observe!\u0027\n The skin of Faethor\u0027s face, large-pored and grainy at best, underwent a swift metamorphosis. Watching it I thought: I have never known what he looks like. And even now I won\u0027t know. He is how he wants me to see him!\n The pores of his face opened up more yet, pockmarks cratering his flesh. His jaws, enormous already, elongated with a sound like gradually tearing cloth, and his leathery lips rolled back until his mouth was all bulging, crimson gums and jagged, dripping teeth. I had seen Faethor\u0027s teeth before, but never displayed like this. Nor was the metamorphosis complete.\n It was all in the jaws, in the teeth, in the nightmarish\n Then, for a long time, I knew no more.\n For which, as you might suppose, I was not unthankful .\n At first, when I regained consciousness, I thought that I was alone. But then I heard Ehrig whimpering in a shadowed corner - heard him and remembered. I remembered the comradeship we\u0027d shared, all the bloody battles we\u0027d been through together. Remembered how he had been my true friend, who would gladly lay down his life for me - and I mine for him.\n Perhaps he remembered, too, and that was why be whimpered. I did not know. I only knew that when the Ferenczy had fastened his teeth in my spine, Ehrig was nowhere to be seen.\n To say that I beat him would not do his punishment justice, but without Faethor\u0027s vampire stuff in him he would certainly have died. It could be that I consciously tried to kill him; I can\u0027t say about that, either, for the episode is no longer clear in my mind. I only know that when I was done with him he no longer felt my blows, and that I myself was completely exhausted. But he healed, of course, and so did I. And I conceived a new strategy.\n After that...here were times of sleeping, of waking, of eating. Outwardly, life consisted of little more. But for me these were also times of waiting, and of patient, silent scheming. As for the Ferenczy: he tried to train me like a wild dog.\n It started like this: he would come silently to the door and listen. Strangely, I knew when he was there. I would feel fear! And when I became afraid, then he would be there. At times I could feel him groping at the edges of my mind, slyly attempting to insinuate himself into my very thoughts. I remembered how he had communicated with old Arvos over a distance and did what I could to close my mind to him. I think I succeeded greatly, for after that I could sense a frustration other than my own.\n He used a system of rewards: if I was \u0027good\u0027 and obeyed him, there would be food. He would call through the door: \u0027Thibor, I have a pair of fine piglets here!\u0027\n If I answered: \u0027Aha! Your parents have come visiting!\u0027 he would simply take the food away. But if I said:\n \u0027Faethor, my father, I am starving! Feed me, pray, for if not then I shall be obliged to eat this dog you\u0027ve locked in with me down here. And who will serve me then, when you are out in the world and I am left in charge of your lands and castle?\u0027 Then he would open the door a crack and place the food inside. But only let me stand too close to the door and I would see neither Faethor nor food for three or four days.\n And so I \u0027weakened\u0027; I grew less and less abusive; I began to plead. For food, for the freedom of the castle, for fresh air and light, and water to bathe myself - but most of all for separation, however brief, from Ehrig whom I now detested as a man detests his own wastes. Moreover, I made out that I was growing physically weaker. I spent more time \u0027asleep\u0027, and came less readily awake.\n Finally came the time when Ehrig could not wake me, and how the dog battered on the door and screamed for his true master then! Faethor came; they carried me up, up to the battlements above the covered hail where it spanned the gorge. There they laid me down in the clean air under the first stars of night, pale spectres in a sky I had not seen for far too long. The sun was a dull blister on the hills, casting its last rays over the spires of rock behind the castle\u0027s towers.\n \u0027He is likely starved for air,\u0027 said Faethor, \u0027and maybe simply starved a little, too! But you are right, Ehrig - he seems weaker than he should be. I desired only to break his will a little, not the man himself. I have powders and salts that sting, which should stir him up. Wait here and I\u0027ll fetch them. And watch him!\u0027\n He descended through a trapdoor out of sight, leaving Ehrig to hunch down to his vigil. All of this I saw through eyes three-quarters shuttered. But the moment Ehrig allowed his attention to wander I was on him in a trice! Closing off his windpipe with one hand, I snatched from my pocket a leather thong which I\u0027d earlier removed from my boot. I had intended it for the Ferenczy\u0027s neck, but no matter. Wrapping my legs round Ehrig to stop him kicking, I looped the thong round his neck and yanked it tight, then made a second loop and tied it off. Choking, he tried to lurch to his feet, but I slammed his head so hard against the stone parapet that I felt his skull shatter. He went limp and I lowered him to the timbered floor.\n At that moment my back was to the trapdoor, and of course that was when the Ferenczy chose to return. Hissing his fury, he came leaping up light as a youth - but his hands were iron on me where he took hold of my hair and grasped the flesh between my neck and shoulder. Ah, but strong though he was, old Faethor was out of practice! And my own fighting skills were as fresh in my mind as my last battle with the Pechenegi.\n I kneed him in the groin and drove my head up under his great jaw so hard that I heard his teeth crunching. He released me, fell to the planking where I leaped astride him; but as his fury waxed, so waxed his strength. Calling on the vampire within, he tossed me aside as easily as a bale of straw! And in a moment he was on his feet, spitting shattered teeth, blood and curses as he came gliding after me.\n I knew then that I couldn\u0027t beat him, not unarmed, and I cast all about in the eerie twilight for a weapon. And found several.\n Suspended from the high rear battlements, a row of circular bronze mirrors hung at different angles, two or three of them just catching the last faint rays of sunlight and reflecting them away down the valley. The Ferenczy\u0027s signalling devices. Arvos the gypsy had said that the old Ferengi didn\u0027t have much use for mirrors, or for sunlight. I wasn\u0027t exactly sure what he\u0027d meant, but I seemed to remember something of the sort from old campfire legends. In any case I didn\u0027t have a lot of choice. If Faethor was vulnerable, then there was only one sure way to find out.\n Before he could close with me, and avoiding places where the timbers seemed suspect, I ran across the roof. He came after me like a great loping wolf, but pulled up short when I tore down a mirror from its fastenings and turned to face him. His yellow eyes went very wide and he bared bloodied teeth at me like rows of shattered spires. He hissed and his forked tongue flickered like crimson lightning between his jaws.\n I held the \u0027mirror\u0027 in my hands and knew at once what it was: a sturdy bronze shield, possibly old Varyagi. It had a grip at the back for my hand. Aye, and I knew how to use it - but if only it were spiked in the centre of its face! Then, unwitting, the burnished bronze caught a stray ray from the scythe of sun setting on the hills - caught it and hurled it straight into Faethor\u0027s snarling visage. And now I knew old Arvos\u0027s meaning.\n The vampire cringed before that blaze of sunlight. He shrank down into himself, threw up spider hands before his face, backed off a pace. I was never one to waste an opportunity. I pursued, drove the buckler clanging into his face, kicked at his loins again and again as I forced him back. And whenever he\u0027d make to advance on me, then I\u0027d catch the sun and throw it in his teeth, so that he had no chance to gather his reserves.\n In this way I beat him back across the roof, with kicks and blows and blinding rays of sunlight. Once his leg went through the rotten roof, but he dragged it out and continued to retreat before me, frothing and cursing his fury. And so at last he came up against the parapet wall. Beyond that parapet was eighty feet of thin air, then the rim of the gorge and three hundred feet of almost sheer slope clad in close-packed, spiky pines. Down at the bottom was the bed of a rivulet. In short, a nightmare of vertigo.\n He looked over the rim, glanced at me with eyes of fire - eyes of fear? At which precise moment the sun dipped down out of sight.\n The change in Faethor was instantaneous. The twilight deepened, and the Ferenczy swelled up like some great bloating toadstool! His face split open in the most soul-wrenching smile of triumph - which I at once crushed under one last battering blow of my buckler.\n And over he went.\n I couldn\u0027t believe that I\u0027d got him. It seemed a fantasy. But even as he toppled so I clung to the parapet wall and peered after him. Then... the strangest thing! I saw him like a dark blot falling towards the greater darkness. But in another moment the shape of the blot changed. I thought I heard a sound like a vast stretching, like giant knuckles cracking, and the shape hurtling towards the trees and the gorge seemed to unfurl like a huge blanket. It no longer fell so swiftly, nor even vertically. Instead it seemed to glide like a leaf, away from the castle\u0027s walls, out a little way over the gorge.\n It dawned on me then that in the fullness of his powers Faethor might indeed have flown, in a fashion, from these battlements. But I had taken him by surprise, and in the shock of falling he had lost precious moments. Too late, he\u0027d wrought a great change in himself, flattening himself like a sail to trap the rushing air. Too late, because even as I stared in fascination, so he struck a high branch. Then, in a dark whirling and a snapping of branches, the blot was gone. There followed from below a series of crashes, a shriek, a final, distant thud. And silence .\n I listened for long moments in the rapidly deepening gloom. Nothing.\n And then I laughed. Oh, how I laughed! I stamped my feet and thumped the top of the parapet wall. I\u0027d got the old bastard, the old devil. I\u0027d really got him!\n I stopped laughing. True, I had thrown him down from the wall. But... was he dead?\n Panic gripped me. Of all men, I knew how difficult it was to kill a vampire. Proof of that was right here on the roof with me, in the shape of the gurgling, fitfully twitching Ehrig. I hurried to him. His face was blue and the thong had buried itself in the flesh of his neck. His skull, which had been soft at the back where I\u0027d crashed it against the wall, was already hard. How long before he awakened? In any case, I couldn\u0027t trust him. Not to do what must now be done. No, I was on my own.\n Quickly I carried Ehrig back down into the bowels of the castle, to our cell in the roots of one of the towers. There I dumped him and barred the door. Perhaps the vampire filth under the earth would find him and devour him before he recovered fully. I didn\u0027t know and cared much less.\n Then I hurried through the castle, lighting lamps and candles wherever I found them, illuminating the place as it had not been lit in a hundred years. Perhaps it had never known such light as I now brought into being in it.\n There were two entrances: one was across the drawbridge and through the door I\u0027d used when first I arrived here escorted by Faethor\u0027s wolves, which I now barred; the other was from a narrow ledge in the cliff at the rear, where a roofed over causeway of doubtful timbers formed a bridge from the ledge to a window in the wall of the second tower. Doubtless this had been the Ferenczy\u0027s bolthole, which he\u0027d never had cause to use. But if he could get out that way, so could he get in. I found oil, drenched the planking, set fire to the causeway and stayed long enough to ensure that it was well ablaze.\n I paused periodically at other embrasures to gaze out on the night. At first there were only the moon and stars, stray wisps of cloud, the valley, silvered, touched occasionally by fleeting shadows. But as I proceeded with my task of lighting and securing the castle, so I was aware that things were beginning to stir. A wolf howled mournfully afar, then closer, then many wolves. The trees in the gorge were inky now, ominous as the gates to the underworld.\n In the first tower I found a barred, bolted room. A treasure house, maybe? I threw back the bolts, lifted the bar, put my shoulder to the door. But the key had been turned in the great lock and removed. I leaned my ear to the oak panels and listened: there was sly movement in there, and... whispering?\n Perhaps it was as well the door was locked. Perhaps it had been locked not to keep thieves out but something else.\n I climbed to the hall where Faethor had poisoned me, and there found my weapons where I had last seen them. More, I took down from the wall a mighty long-handled axe. Then, armed to the teeth, I returned to the locked room. There I loaded my crossbow and placed it close to hand, stuck my sword point-down in a crack in the floor, ready for grasping, and took both hands to the axe in a huge swing at the door. I succeeded with that blow in caving in a narrow panel, but at the same time I dislodged from its hiding place atop the lintel a rusty iron key.\n The key fitted the lock. I was on the point of turning it to enter, when - such a clamouring from the wolves! So loud I could\n hear its doomful dinning even down here! Something was afoot.\n I left the door unopened, took up my weapons and raced up winding stairs to the upper levels. Wolves howled all around the castle now, but they were loudest at the rear. In a very little while I traced the uproar to the burning causeway, and arrived in time to see the bridge go crashing down, blazing into the back chasm. And there across the gap were Faethor\u0027s wolves in a pack, crowding the narrow ledge.\n Behind them in the shadow of the cliff... was that the Ferenczy himself? The hairs on my neck stood erect. If it was him, he stood crookedly, like a queer bent shadow. Broken from his fall? I took up my crossbow but when I looked again - gone! Or perhaps he\u0027d never been there. The wolves were real enough, however, and now the leader, a giant of a beast, stood at the rim measuring the gap.\n It would be a leap of all of thirty feet, possible only if he had a clear run along the ledge. And even as I thought it, so the lesser wolves made way, shrank back into shadows, left the ledge clear. He ran back, turned, made his loping run and leaped - and mid-flight met my bolt, which sank directly into his heart. Dead, but still snarling his last snarl, he hit the rim of the opening and went tumbling into oblivion. And when I looked up, the rest of the pack had melted away.\n But I knew that the Ferenczy would not give up that easily.\n I went up onto the battlements, found jars up there full of oil and cauldrons seated on tilting gear. Setting fires in braziers under the cauldrons, I half-filled each one with oil and left them to simmer. And only then did I return to the locked room.\n As 1 approached a hand, slender, female, wriggled in the hole in the panelling, tried desperately to reach and take hold of the key in the lock. What? A prisoner? A woman? But then I remembered what old Arvos had said about the Ferenczy\u0027s household: \u0027Retainers? Serfs? He has none. A woman or two, perhaps, but no men.\u0027 Here was a seeming contradiction: if this woman was his servant, why was she locked in? For her safety while there was a stranger in the house? That seemed unlikely in a house like this.\n For my safety?\n An eye peered out at me; I heard a gasp and the hand was withdrawn. Without further pause I turned the key, kicked open the door.\n There were two of \u0027em, aye. And they\u0027d been handsome enough women in their time.\n \u0027Who... who are you?\u0027 One of them approached me with a curious half-smile. \u0027Faethor did not tell us that there would be...\u0027 She floated closer, gazed upon me in open fascination. I stared back. She was wan as a ghost, but there was a fire in her sunken eyes. I looked about the room.\n The floor had a covering of local weave; ancient and wormy tapestries hung on the walls; there were couches and a table. But there were no windows, and no light other than the yellow aura from a silver candelabrum on the table. The room was sparse, but sumptuous by comparison with the rest of the place. Safe, too.\n The second woman was sprawled somewhat wantonly on one of the couches. She stared sulphurously upon me but I ignored her. The first drifted closer still. Stirring myself, I held her at bay with the point of my sword. \u0027Move not at all, lady, or I\u0027ll spit you here and now!\u0027\n She turned wild in a moment, glowered at me and hissed between her needle teeth; and now the second woman rose like a cat from her couch. They faced me menacingly, but both were wary of my sword.\n Then the first one spoke again, her voice hard and cold as ice: \u0027What of Faethor? Where is he?\u0027\n \u0027Your master?\u0027 I backed out of the door. They were\n vampires, obviously. \u0027He\u0027s gone. You\u0027ve a new master now - me!\u0027\n Without warning, the first one sprang at me. I let her come, then drove the pommel of my sword against the side of her head. She collapsed in my arms and I threw her aside, then yanked shut the door in the face of the second. I barred it, locked it and pocketed the key. Inside the room, the trapped vampire hissed and raged. I picked up her stunned sister, carried her to the dungeon and tossed her inside.\n Ehrig came crawling. He had managed somehow to remove the thong from his neck,-which was white and puffy and looked sliced as if by a knife around its entire circumference. Similarly, his head at the back was strangely lumpy, deformed like a freak\u0027s or a cretin\u0027s. He could hardly speak and his manner was childlike in the way of simpletons. Perhaps I had damaged his brain, and the vampire in him had not yet corrected it.\n \u0027Thibor!\u0027 he husked his amazement. \u0027My friend, Thibor! The Ferenczy - did you kill him?\u0027\n \u0027Treacherous dog!\u0027 I kicked at him. \u0027Here, amuse yourself with this.\u0027\n He fell upon the woman where she lay moaning. \u0027You\u0027ve forgiven me!\u0027 he cried.\n \u0027Not now, not ever!\u0027 I answered. \u0027I leave her here because she\u0027s one too many. Enjoy yourself while you may.\u0027 As I barred the door he had already begun to rip his filthy clothes off, hers too.\n Now, climbing the spiralling steps, I heard the wolves again. Their song had a triumphant note to it. What now?\n Like a madman I raced through the castle. The massive door in the foot of the tower was secure, and the causeway burned down - where would Faethor attempt his next assault? I went to the battlements - only just in time!\n The air over the castle was full of tiny bats. I saw them against the moon, flitting in their myriads, their concerted voices shrill and piercing. Was that how the Ferenczy would come: flitting like a great bat, a stretchy blanket of flesh falling out of the night to smother me? I shrank down, gazed fearfully up into the vault of the night sky. But no, surely not; his fall had injured him and he would not yet be ready to tax himself so greatly; there must be some other route with which I was not familiar.\n Ignoring the bats, which came down at me in waves, but not so close as to strike or interfere with me, I went to the perimeter wall and looked over. Why I did this I can\u0027t say, for it would take more than any mere man to climb walls as sheer as these. Fool that I was - the Ferenczy was no mere man!\n And there he was: flat to the wall, making his way agonisingly slowly, like a great lizard, up the stonework. A lizard, aye, for his hands and feet were huge as banquet platters and sucked where they slapped the walls! Horrified to my roots, I stared harder in the dark. He had not yet seen me. He grunted quietly and his huge disc of a hand made a quagmire sound where it left the wall and groped upward. His fingers were long as daggers and webbed between. Hands like that would pull a man\u0027s flesh from his bones as if they were plucking a chicken!\n I looked wildly about. The bubbling cauldrons of oil were positioned at the ends of the span, where the great hall joined the towers. Rightly so, for who would suppose that a man could crawl under the flying buttresses and come up that way, with nothing but the gorge and certain death beneath him?\n I flew to the closest cauldron, laid my hands on its rim. Agony! The metal was hot as hell.\n I took my sword belt and passed it through the metal framework of the tilting engine, then dragged device and cauldron and all back the way I had come. Oil splashed and drenched my boot; one foot of the tilting bench went through a rotten plank and I must pause to free it; the entire contraption jerked and shuddered through friction with the planking, so that I knew Faethor must hear me and guess what I was about. But finally I had the cauldron above the spot where I had seen him.\n I glanced fearfully over the parapet - and a great groping sucker hand came up over the rim, missed my face by inches, slapped down and gripped the coping of the wall!\n How I gibbered then! I threw myself on to the tilting device, turned the handle furiously, and saw the cauldron bearing over towards the wall. Oil spilled and ran down the cauldron\u0027s side. It met the hot brazier and caught fire; my boot went up in flames. The Ferenczy\u0027s face came up over the rim of the parapet. His eyes reflected the leaping flames. His teeth, whole again, were gleaming white slivers of bone in his gaping jaws, with that flickering abomination of a tongue slithering over them.\n Shrieking, I worked at the handle. The cauldron tilted, slopped a sea of blazing oil towards him.\n \u0027NO!\u0027 he croaked, his voice a broken bell. \u0027NO - NO - NOOOOOO!\u0027\n The blue and yellow fire paid him no heed, ignored his cry of terror. It washed over him, lit him like a torch. He wrenched his hands from the wall and reached for me, but I fell back out of harm\u0027s way. Then he screamed again, and launched himself from the wall into space.\n I watched the fireball curving down into darkness and turning it day bright, and all the while the Ferenczy\u0027s scream echoed back up to me. His myriad minion bats flocked to him mid-flight, dashing their soft bodies against him to quell the flames, but the rush of air thwarted them. A torch, he fell, and his scream was a rusty blade on the ends of my nerves. Even blazing, he tried to form a wing shape, and I heard again that rending and crackling sound. Ah, what sweet agony that must have caused him, with his crisp skin splitting instead of stretching, and the burning oil getting into the cracks!\n Even so, he half-succeeded, began to glide as before, and as before struck a tree and so went spinning and crashing through the pines and out of sight.\n He left a few sparks and scraps of fire drifting on the air, and a host of scorched bats skittering crippled against the moon, and a lingering odour of roasted flesh. And that was all.\n Still I wasn\u0027t satisfied that he was dead, but I was satisfied that he wouldn\u0027t be back that night. It was now time to celebrate my triumph.\n I doused the fire where it had taken hold of dry timbers, shut down the burning braziers, and went wearily to Faethor\u0027s living quarters. There was good wine there which I sipped warily, then gulped heartily. I spitted pheasants, sliced an onion, nibbled on dry bread and swilled wine until the birds were done. And then I dined royally. It was a good meal, aye, and my first in a long time, and yet... it lacked something. I couldn\u0027t say just what. Fool, I still thought of myself as a man. In other ways, however, I still was a man!\n I took a stone jar of proven wine with me and went unsteadily to the lady in the locked room. She did desire to receive me, but I was in no mood for arguments. I took her again and again; in as many ways as entered my head, so I entered her. Only when she was exhausted and slept did I, too, sleep.\n And so the castle of Faethor Ferenczy became mine... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-ii-wamphyri-necroscope-2/page-9.html","bookId":2117,"book":{"id":2117,"title":"Necroscope II: Wamphyri (Necroscope #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The spirit of Harry Keogh now resides in his son, Harry Jr. When his infant son sleeps, Harry can roam the Continuum and speak to the dead, but is gradually losing his control as the son \"reels\" his father\u0027s spirit back in.
