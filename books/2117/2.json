{"id":92833,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"The old Thing in the ground trembled however minutely, shuddered slightly, strove to return to his immemorial dreaming. Something was intruding, threatening to rouse him up from his dark slumbers, but sleep had become a habit which satisfied his every need... almost. He clung to his loathsome dreams - of madness and mayhem, the hell of living and the horror of dying, and the pleasures of blood, blood, blood - and felt the cold embrace of the clotted earth closing him in, weighing him down, holding him here in his darkling grave. And yet the earth was familiar and no longer held any terrors for him; the darkness was like that of a shuttered room or deep vault, an impenetrable gloom entirely in keeping; the forbidding nature and location of his mausoleum not only set him apart but kept him protected. He was safe here. Damned forever, certainly - doomed for all time, yes, barring some major miracle of intervention - but safe, too, and there was much to be said for safety.\\n\\n Safe from the men - mere men, most of them - who had put him here. For in his dreaming the wizened Thing had forgotten that those men were long dead. And their sons, dead. And theirs, and theirs...\\n\\n The old Thing in the ground had lived for five hundred years, and as long again had lain undead in his unhallowed grave. Above him, in the gloom of a glade beneath stirless, snow-laden trees, the tumbled stones and slabs of his tomb told something of his story, but only the Thing himself knew all of it. His name had been... but no, the Wamphyri have no names as such. His host\u0027s name, then, had been Thibor Ferenczy, and in the beginning Thibor had been a man. But that had been almost a thousand years ago.\\n\\n The Thibor part of the Thing in the ground existed still, but changed, mutated, mingled and metamorphosed along with its vampire \u0027guest\u0027. The two were one now, inseparably fused; but in dreams that spanned a millennium, still Thibor could return to his roots, go back to the immensely cruel past...\\n\\n In the very beginning he had not been a Ferenczy but an Ungar, though that was of no account now. His forefathers were farmers who came from a Hungarian princedom across the Carpathians to settle on the banks of the Dniester where it flowed down to the Black Sea. But \u0027settling\u0027 was hardly the word for it. They had had to fight Vikings (the dreadful Varyagi) on the river, where they came exploring from the Black Sea, the Khazars and vassal Magyars from the steppes, finally the fierce Pechenegi tribes in their constant expansion west and north-wards. Thibor had been a young man then, when at last the Pechenegi wiped out the rude settlement he called home and he alone survived. After that he\u0027d fled north to Kiev.\\n\\n Never much of a farmer, indeed, far more suited for war with his massive size - which in those days, when most men were small, made Thibor the Wallach some-thing of a giant - in Kiev he sold himself into the service of Vladimir I. The Vlad made him a small Voevod or warrior chief and gave him a hundred men. \u0027Go join my Boyars in the south,\u0027 he commanded. \u0027Fend off and kill the Pechenegi, keep \u0027em from crossing the Ros, and by our new Christian God I\u0027ll give you title and banner both, Thibor of Wallachia!\u0027 Thibor had gone to him when he was desperate, that much was clear.\\n\\n In his dream, the Thing in the ground remembered how he\u0027d answered: Title and banner, keep them, my Lord -but only give me one hundred men more and I shall kill you a thousand Pechenegi before returning to Kiev. Aye, and I\u0027ll bring you their thumbs to prove it!\u0027\\n\\n He got his hundred men; also, like it or not, his banner: a golden dragon, one forepaw raised in warning. \u0027The dragon of the true Christ, brought to us by the Greeks,\u0027 Vlad told him. \u0027Now the dragon watches over Christian Kiev - Russia itself - and it roars from your banner with the voice of the Lord! What mark of your own will you put on it?\u0027 On that same morning he had asked this question of half-a-dozen other fledgling defenders, five Boyars with their own followers and one band of mercenaries. All of them had taken a symbol to fly with the dragon. But not Thibor.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m no Boyar, sire,\u0027 the Wallach had told him with a shrug. \u0027That\u0027s not to say my father\u0027s house was not honourable, for it was, and built by a decent man - but in no way royal. No lord\u0027s or prince\u0027s blood flows in my veins. When I\u0027ve earned myself a mark, then I\u0027ll set it over your dragon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure I like you especially, Wallach.\u0027 The Vlad had frowned then, uneasy with this great, grim man before him. \u0027Your voice sounds out perhaps a trifle loud from a heart as yet untried. But - \u0027 and he, too, had given a shrug, \u0027 - very well, choose a device for yourself when you return in triumph. And Thibor - bring me those thumbs or I\u0027ll likely string you up by yours!\u0027 And that day at noon seven polyglot companies of men had set out from Kiev, reinforcements for the ensieged defensive positions on the Ros. One year and one month later Thibor returned with nearly all of his men, plus another eighty recruited from peasants hiding in the foothills and valleys of the southern Khorvaty. He made no plea for audience but strode into the Vlad\u0027s own church where he was at worship. He left his weary men outside and took in with him only one small sack that rattled, and approached Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavich at his prayers and waited for him to finish. Behind him Kiev\u0027s civilian nobles were deathly silent, waiting for their prince to see him.\\n\\n Finally the Vlad and his Greek monks turned to Thibor. The sight they saw was fearsome. Thibor had soil on him from the fields and forests; dirt was ingrained in him; he bore a freshly healed scar high on his right cheek to the middle of his jaw, which made a pale stripe of scar tissue that cut almost to the bone. Also, he had gone away as a peasant and returned something else entirely. Haughty as a hawk, with his nose slightly hooked under bushy eye-brows that very nearly came together in the middle, he gazed out of yellow, unblinking eyes. He wore mous-taches and a scraggy, twisting black beard; also the armour of some Pechenegi chief, chased in gold and silver, and an earring set with a gemstone in the lobe of his left ear. He had shaved his head with the exception of black forelocks that hung one to each side, in the manner of certain nobles; and in all his mien, there was no sign that he knew he stood in a holy place or even considered his whereabouts.\\n\\n \u0027I know you now,\u0027 the Vlad hissed, \u0027Thibor the Wallach. Don\u0027t you fear the true God? Don\u0027t you tremble before the cross of Christ? I was praying for our deliverance, and you-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I have brought it to you.\u0027 Thibor\u0027s voice was deep, doleful. He tipped out his sack onto the flags. The prince\u0027s retinue and the nobles of Kiev where they stood back from him who ruled over them gasped and gaped. Bones clattered white in a heap at the Vlad\u0027s feet.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 he choked. \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thumbs,\u0027 said Thibor. \u0027I had the flesh boiled off them,\\n\\n lest their stink offend. The Pechenegi are driven back, trapped between the Dniester, the Bug and the sea. Your Boyar army hems them in. Hopefully they can deal with them without me and mine. For I have heard that the Polovtsy are rising like the wind in the east. Also, in Turkey-land, armies wax for war!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have heard? You have heard? And are you some mighty Voevod, then? Do you set yourself up as the ears of Vladimir? And what do you mean, \"you and yours\"? The two hundred men you marched with are mine!\u0027\\n\\n At that Thibor took a deep breath. He paced forward -then paused. Then he bowed low, if inelegantly, and said, \u0027Of course they are yours, Prince. Also the four-score refugees I\u0027ve gathered together and turned into warriors. All are yours. As for being your ears: if I have heard falsely, then strike me deaf. But my work is finished in the south and I thought you had more need of me here. Soldiers are few in Kiev this day, and her borders are wide...\u0027\\n\\n The Vlad\u0027s eyes remained veiled. The Pechenegi are at bay, you say - and do you give yourself credit for this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In all modesty. This and more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you\u0027ve brought my men back with you, without casualty?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A handful are fallen.\u0027 Thibor shrugged. \u0027But I found eighty to replace them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Show me.\u0027\\n\\n They went to the great doors, out onto the wide steps of the church. There in the square, Thibor\u0027s men waited in silence, some upon horses but most afoot, all armed to the teeth and looking very fierce. They were the same sorry bunch the Wallach had taken away with him, but no longer sorry. His standard flew from three tall flagstaffs: the golden dragon, and upon its back a black bat with of carnelian.\\n\\n The Vlad nodded. \u0027Your mark,\u0027 he commented, per-haps sourly. \u0027A bat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The black bat of the Wallachs, aye,\u0027 said Thibor. One of the monks spoke up, \u0027But atop the dragon?\u0027\\n\\n Thibor grinned at him wolfishly. \u0027Would you have the dragon pissing on my bat?\u0027 The monks took the prince aside while Thibor stood waiting. He could not hear what was said, but he\u0027d imagined it often enough in times since:\\n\\n \u0027These men are utterly loyal to him! See how proud they stand beneath his banner?\u0027 the senior monk would have whispered in that sly Greek way. \u0027It could be a nuisance.\u0027\\n\\n And Vlad: \u0027Does it trouble you? I have five times their number right here in the city.\u0027\\n\\n The Greek: \u0027But these men have been tried in battle; they are warriors all!\u0027\\n\\n Vlad: \u0027What are you saying? I should fear him? I\u0027ve Varyagi blood in me and fear no man!\u0027\\n\\n Greek: \u0027Of course you don\u0027t. But... he sets himself above his station, this one. Can we not find him a task -him and a handful of his men - and keep the rest of them back here to bolster the city\u0027s defences? This way, in his absence, their loyalty will surely swing more rightly to you.\u0027\\n\\n And Vladimir Svyatoslavich\u0027s eyes narrowing more yet. Then - his nod of approval: I have the very thing. Yes, and I believe you\u0027re right - best to be rid of him. These Wallachs are a tricky lot. Far too insular...\u0027 And out loud to the Voevod: \u0027Thibor, I\u0027m honouring you tonight at the palace. You and five of your best. Then you can tell me all about your victories. But there\u0027ll be ladies there, so see you\u0027re washed and leave your armour in your lodgings and tents.\u0027\\n\\n With a stiff little bow Thibor backed off, went down the steps to his mount, led his men away. At his command, as they left the square, they rattled their weapons and gave a single, sharp, ringing shout: \u0027Prince Vladimir!\u0027 Then they were gone into the autumn morning, gone into Kiev, called the City at the Edge of the Woods...\\n\\n Despite the disturbance, the unknown intrusion, the Thing in the ground continued to dream. Night would soon fall, and Thibor was sensitive to night as a rooster is to the dawn, but for now he dreamed.\\n\\n That night at the palace - a huge place with stone chimneys in every room, and wood fires blazing, sprinkled with aromatic resins - Thibor had worn clean but common clothes under a rich red robe taken from some high-ranking Pechenegi. His flesh was washed and perfumed, tanned like leather, and his forelocks freshly greased. He was an imposing sight. His officers, too, were spruce. Though they obviously stood in awe of him, still he spoke to them with some familiarity; but he was courteous to the ladies, attentive to the Vlad.\\n\\n It was possible (so Thibor had later reckoned) that the prince found himself in two minds: the Wallach would seem to have proved himself a warrior, a Voevod indeed. By rights he should be made a Boyar, given lands of his own. A man will fight even harder if he fights to protect that which is his. But there was that sombre something about Thibor which the Vlad found disquieting. So perhaps his Greek advisors were right.\\n\\n \u0027Now tell me how you dealt with the Pechenegi, Thibor of Wallachia,\u0027 Vladimir finally commanded, when all were feasting. Their dishes were several: Greek sausages wrapped in vine leaves; joints roasted in the Viking fashion; goulashes steaming in huge pots. Meads and wines came by the gallon. All at table stabbed and speared with their knives at smoking meats; short bursts of con-versation would erupt now and then amidst the general clatter of eating. Thibor\u0027s voice, though he hardly raised it at all, had carried over all of that. And gradually the great table had grown quieter.\\n\\n \u0027The Pechenegi come in parties or tribes. They are not like a mighty army; there is little of unity; they have their own chiefs who vie with each other. The earthworks and fortifications on the Ros at the edge of the wooded steppe have stopped them because they are not united. If they came as an army they could cross river and battlements both in a day, carrying all away before them. But they merely probe around our defences, contenting themselves with whatever they can pillage in short, sharp forays to east and west. This is how they sacked Kolomyya on the west flank. They crossed the Prut by day, crept forward in the forests, rested overnight and attacked at first light. It is their way. And so they gradually encroach.\\n\\n \u0027This is how I saw the situation: because the defences are there, our soldiers use them: we hide behind them. The earthworks act as a border. We have been content to say, \"South of these works lies the territory of the Pechenegi, and we must keep him out.\" Wherefore the Pechenegi, barbarian that he is, in fact holds us in siege! I have sat on the walls of our forts and seen our enemies make camp, unafraid. Smoke from his fires goes up, all untroubled, because we don\u0027t molest him on \"his\" ground.\\n\\n \u0027When I left Kiev, Prince Vladimir, you said: \"Fend off the Pechenegi, keep him from crossing the Ros.\" But I said, \"Pursue the fiend and kill him!\" One day I saw a camp of some two hundred; they had their women, even their children with them! They were camped across the river, to the west, quite apart from the other encamp-ments. I split my two hundred in half. Half went with me across the river in the dusk. We stole up on the Pechenegi fires. They had guards out but most of them were sleeping - and we cut their throats in the night without them ever knowing who killed them! Then we set about the camp -but all in silence. I had daubed my men in mud. Any man not daubed was Pechenegi. In the darkness we slew them, flitting from tent to tent. We were like great bats in the night, and it was very bloody.\\n\\n \u0027When the camp was awakened half were already dead. The rest gave chase. We led them back to the Ros; and them hounding us, eager to catch us at the river, all of them shouting and screaming their warcries! But we shouted and screamed not at all. At the river, on the Pechenegi side, my second hundred lay in waiting. They were daubed in mud. They struck not at their silent, muddy brothers but trapped the howling pursuers. Then we rose up, turned in upon the Pechenegi, slew them to a man. And we cut off their thumbs...\u0027 He paused.\\n\\n \u0027Bravo!\u0027 said Vladimir the prince, faintly.\\n\\n \u0027Another time,\u0027 Thibor continued, \u0027we went to Kamenets which was under siege. Again I had half my men with me. The Pechenegi about the town saw us, gave chase. We led them into a steep-sided gulley where, after we had scrambled through, my other half rained down an avalanche upon them. I lost many thumbs that time, buried under the boulders - else I would have brought you back another sackful!\u0027\\n\\n Now there was almost total silence about the table. It was not so much the reporting of these deeds that impressed but the stony delivery, which lacked all emotion. When the Pechenegi had raided, raped and razed this man\u0027s Ungar settlement, they had turned him into an utterly pitiless killer.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve had reports, of course,\u0027 Svyatoslavich broke the silence, \u0027if somewhat vague until now and few and far between. But this is something to chew on. And so my Boyars have driven the Pechenegi back, you say? A recent turn of events? Perhaps they learned something from you, eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They learned that standing guard behind high walls achieves nothing!\u0027 said Thibor. \u0027I spoke to them and said: \"Summer is at an end. The Pechenegi far to the south are grown fat and idle from the little work they\u0027ve had to do; they do not think we\u0027ll come against them. They are building permanent settlements, winter homes for them-selves. Like the Khazars before them, they are putting aside the sword in favour of the plough. If we strike now they\u0027ll fall like grass beneath the scythe!\" Then, all the Boyars banded together, crossed the river, struck deep into the southern steppes. We killed the Pechenegi wherever we found them.\\n\\n \u0027But by then I had heard rumours of a greater peril in the making: to the east the Polovtsy are rising up! They spill over from the great steppes and deserts, expand westward - soon they\u0027ll be at our doors. When the Khazars fell they left the way open for the Pechenegi. And after the Pechenegi? Which is why I thought - why I dared to think - that perhaps the Vlad would give me an army and send me east, to put down our enemies before they wax too strong...\u0027\\n\\n For long moments Prince Vladimir simply sat and stared at him from eyes half-lidded. Then he quietly said, \u0027You\u0027ve come a long way in a year and a month, Wallach...\u0027 And out loud, to his guests: \u0027Eat, drink, talk! Honour this man. We owe him that much.\u0027 But as the feasting continued he got up, indicating that Thibor should walk with him. They went out into the grounds, into the cool autumn evening. The wood smoke was fragrant under the trees.\\n\\n A little way from the palace, the prince paused. Thibor, we\u0027ll have to see about this idea of yours - this eastward invasion, for that\u0027s what it would be - for I\u0027m not sure we\u0027re ready for that. It\u0027s been tried before, you know.\u0027 He nodded bitterly. \u0027The Grand Prince himself tried it. First he tackled the Khazars - Svyatoslav ground them down and the Byzantines swept up their pieces -and then he had a go at Bulgaria and Macedonia. And while he was at it the nomads laid siege to Kiev itself! And did he pay for his zeal? Aye, however many sagas are written about him. Nomads sank him in the river rapids and made his skull into a drinking cup! He was hasty, you see? Oh, he got rid of the Khazars, all right, but only to let in the damned Pechenegi! And shall I be hasty too?\u0027\\n\\n The Wallach stood silent for a moment in the dusk. \u0027You\u0027ll send me back to the southern steppe, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I might, and I might not. I might stand you down from the fighting entirely, make you a Boyar, give you land and men to look after it for you. There\u0027s a lot of good land here, Thibor.\u0027\\n\\n Thibor shook his head. \u0027Then I\u0027d prefer to return to Wallachia. I\u0027m no farmer, Prince. I tried that and the Pechenegi came and made a warrior of me. Since then -all my dreams have been red ones. Dreams of blood. The blood of my enemies, the enemies of this land.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what of my enemies?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They are the same. Only show them to me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said the Vlad, I\u0027ll show you one of them, Do you know the mountains to the west, which divide us from the Hungarians?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My fathers were Ungars,\u0027 said Thibor. \u0027As for the mountains: I was born under them. Not in the west but in the south, in the land of the Wallachs, beyond the bend in the mountains.\u0027\\n\\n The prince nodded. \u0027So you have some experience of mountains and their treachery. Good. But on my side of those peaks, beyond Galich, in that area called the Khorvaty after a certain people, there lives a Boyar who is ... not my friend. I claim him as one who owes allegiance to me, but when I called in all my little princelings and Boyars he came not. When I invite him to Kiev he answers not. When I express a desire to meet with him he ignores me. If he is not my friend then he can only be my enemy. He is a dog that comes not to heel. A wild dog, and his home is a mountain fastness. Until now I\u0027ve had neither the time, the inclination, nor the power to winkle him out, but - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Thibor was astonished, his gasp cutting the Vlad short. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, my Prince, but you - no power?\u0027\\n\\n Vladimir Svyatoslavich shook his head. \u0027You don\u0027t understand,\u0027 he said. \u0027Of course I have power. Kiev has power. But all so extended as to be almost expended! Should I recall an army to deal with one unruly princeling? And in so doing let the Pechenegi come up again? Should I form up an army from farmers and officials and peasants, all unskilled in battle? And if I did, what then? An army could not bring this Ferenczy out of his castle if he did not wish to leave it. Even an army could not destroy him, his defences are so strong! What? They are the mountain passes themselves, the gorges, the avalanches! With a handful of fierce, faithful retainers, he could hold back any army I muster almost indefinitely. Oh, if I had two thousand men to spare, then I might possibly starve him with a siege, but at what expense? On the other hand, what an army cannot achieve might just be possible - for one brave and clever and loyal man...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you saying you want this Ferenczy taken from his castle and brought to you in Kiev?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Too late for that, Thibor. He has shown how he \"respects\" me. How then should I respect him? No, I want him dead! His lands then fall to me, his castle on the heights, his household and serfs. And his death will be an example to others who might think to stand apart.\u0027\\n\\n Then you don\u0027t want his thumbs but his head!\u0027 Thibor\u0027s chuckle was throaty, without humour.\\n\\n \u0027I want his head, his heart, and his standard. And I want to burn all three on a bonfire right here in Kiev!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027His standard? He has a symbol, then, this Ferenczy? Might I enquire the nature of this blazon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027By all means,\u0027 said the prince, his grey eyes suddenly thoughtful. He lowered his voice, cast about in the dusk for a moment, as if to be doubly sure that no one heard. \u0027His mark is the horned head of a devil, with a forked tongue that drips gouts of blood...\u0027\\n\\n Blood!\\n\\n Gouts of blood soaking into the black earth. The sun had touched the horizon and was burning red there like... like a great gout of blood. Soon the earth would swallow it up. The old Thing in the ground trembled again; its husk of leather and bone slowly cracked open like a desiccated sponge to receive the earth\u0027s tribute, the blood that soaked through leaf-mould and roots and black, centuried soil down to where the thousand-year-old Thibor-creature lay in his shallow grave.\\n\\n Subconsciously Thibor sensed the seeping blood and knew, in the way all dreamers \u0027know\u0027, that it was only part of the dream. It would be a different matter when the sun had set and the seepage actually touched him, but for now he ignored it, returned to that time at the turn of the tenth century when he\u0027d been merely human and had gone up into the Khorvaty on a mission of murder...\\n\\n They had travelled as trappers, Thibor and his seven, as Wallachians who followed the Carpathian curve on a trek designed to get them deep into the northern forests by the onset of winter. In fact they had simply come from Kiev through Kolomyya and so to the mountains, but they\u0027d taken all the paraphernalia of the trapper with them, to substantiate their story. It had taken them three weeks of steady riding to reach the place in the very lee of the sheer mountains, (a \u0027village\u0027, consisting of a handful of stone houses built into the hillside, half-a-dozen semi-permanent cabins, and a smattering of gypsy tents of cured skins with the fur inside) which the current incumbents called Moupho Aide Ferenc Yaborov, a mouthful they invariably shortened to Ferenc, which they made to sound like \u0027Ferengi\u0027. It meant \u0027Place of the Old One\u0027, or \u0027of the Old Ferengi\u0027, and the gypsies spoke of it in lowered tones and with a deal of respect.\\n\\n There were maybe a hundred men there, some thirty women and as many children. Half of the men were trappers passing through, or prospective settlers uprooted by Pechenegi raids, on their way to find homes further north. Many of the latter group had their families with them. The remainder were either peasant inhabitants of Ferengi Yaborov, or gypsies come here to winter it out. They\u0027d been coming since time immemorial, apparently, for \u0027the old devil\u0027 who was Boyar here was good to them and turned none away. Indeed, in times of hardship he\u0027d even been known to supply his wandering occasional tenants with food from his own larder and wine from his cellars.\\n\\n Thibor, asking about food and drink for himself and the others, was shown a house of timbers set in a stand of pines. It was an inn of sorts, with tiny rooms up in the rafters which could only be reached by rope ladders; the ladders were drawn up when the boarder wished to sleep. Down below there were wooden tables and stools, and at one end of the large room a bar stocked with small kegs of plum brandy and buckets of sweet ale. One wall was built half of stone, where burned a fire in the base of a huge chimney. On the fire was an iron pot of goulash giving out a heavy paprika reek. Onions dangled in bunches from nails in the wall close to the fire; likewise huge coarse-skinned sausages; black bread stood in loaves on the tables, baked in a stone oven to one side of the fire.\\n\\n A man, his wife and one scruffy son ran the place; gypsies, Thibor guessed, who\u0027d chosen to settle here. They could have done better, he thought, feeling cold in the shadows of the looming rocks, the mountains whose presence could be felt even indoors. It was a gloomy place this, frowning and foreboding.\\n\\n The Wallach had told his men to speak to no one, but as they put away their gear, ate and drank, spoke in muffled tones to each other, he himself shared a jug of brandy with his host. \u0027Who are you?\u0027 that gnarled old man asked him.\\n\\n \u0027Do you ask what I have been and where I have been?\u0027 Thibor answered. \u0027That\u0027s easier to tell than who I am.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell it then, if you feel like talking.\u0027\\n\\n Thibor smiled and sipped brandy. \u0027I was a young boy under the Carpatii. My father was an Ungar who wandered into the borders of the southern steppe to farm - him and his brothers and kin and their families. I\u0027ll be brief: came the Pechenegi, all was uprooted, our settlement destroyed. Since then I\u0027ve wandered, fought the barbarian for payment and what little I could find on his body, done what I could where and whenever. Now I\u0027ll be a trapper. I\u0027ve seen the mountains, the steppe, the forests. Farming\u0027s a hard life and blood-letting makes a man bitter. But in the towns and cities there\u0027s money to be had from furs. You\u0027ve roamed a bit yourself, I\u0027ll vow?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here and there,\u0027 the other shrugged, nodded. He was swarthy as smoke-grimed leather, wrinkled as a walnut from extremes of weather, lean as a wolf. Not young by any standards, still his hair was shiny black, his eyes too, and he seemed to have all of his teeth. But he moved his limbs carefully and his hands were very crooked. \u0027I\u0027d be doing it still if my bones hadn\u0027t started to seize up. We had a cart of two wheels wrapped in leather, which we\u0027d break down and carry when the way was rough. Upon the cart we took our house and goods along with us: a big tent with rooms, and cooking pots, and tools. We were -we are - Szgany, gypsies, and became Szgany Ferengi when I built this place here.\u0027 He craned his neck and looked up, wide-eyed, at one interior wall of the house. It was a look half respectful, half fearful. There was no window but the Wallach knew that the old man stared up at the mountain peaks.\\n\\n \u0027Szgany Ferengi?\u0027 Thibor repeated. \u0027You ally yourself to the Boyar Ferenczy in his castle, then?\u0027\\n\\n The old gypsy lowered his eyes from the unseen heights, drew back a little, took on a suspicious look. Thibor quickly poured him more of his own brandy. The other remained silent and the Wallach shrugged. \u0027No matter, it\u0027s just that I\u0027ve heard good things of him,\u0027 he lied. \u0027My father knew him, once...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indeed!\u0027 the old man\u0027s eyes widened.\\n\\n Thibor nodded. \u0027One cold winter, the Ferenczy gave him shelter in his castle. My father told me, if ever I passed this way, I should go up and remind the Boyar of that time, and thank him on behalf of my father.\u0027\\n\\n The old man stared at Thibor for long moments. \u0027So, you\u0027ve heard good things of our master, have you? From your father, eh? And you were born under the mountains...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is something strange?\u0027 Thibor raised a dark eyebrow.\\n\\n The other looked him up and down. \u0027You\u0027re a big man,\u0027 he said, grudgingly, \u0027and strong, I can tell. Also, you look fierce. A Wallach, eh, whose fathers were Ungars? Well, perhaps you are, perhaps you are.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps I am what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s said,\u0027 the gypsy whispered, drawing closer, \u0027that the old Ferengi\u0027s true sons always come home to roost. In the end they come here, seek him out - seek out their father! Would you climb up to see him?\u0027\\n\\n Thibor put on a look of indecision. He shrugged. \u0027I might, if I knew the way. But these cliffs and passes are treacherous.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know the way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve been there?\u0027 Thibor tried not to seem too eager.\\n\\n The old man nodded. \u0027Oh, yes, and I could take you. But would you go alone? The Ferengi\u0027s not one for too many visitors.\u0027\\n\\n Thibor appeared to give it some little thought. \u0027I\u0027d want to take two of my friends, at least. In case the way gets rough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Huh! If these old bones can make it, surely yours can! Just two of them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For assistance in the steep places.\u0027\\n\\n Thibor\u0027s host pursed his lips. \u0027It would cost you a little something. My time and...\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s understood,\u0027 the Wallach stopped him.\\n\\n The gypsy scratched his ear. \u0027What do you know of the old Ferengi? What have you heard of him?\u0027\\n\\n Thibor saw a chance for knowledge. Getting information out of people such as these was like drawing the teeth of a bear! \u0027I\u0027ve heard he has a great company of men garrisoned with him, and that his castle is a fastness impenetrable. Because of this he swears no fealty, pays no taxes on his lands, for none may collect it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hah! The old gypsy laughed out loud, thumped the bar, poured more brandy. \u0027A company of men? Retainers?\\n\\n Serfs? He has none! A woman or two, perhaps, but no men. Only the wolves guard those passes. As for his castle: it hugs the cliff. One way in - for mere men - and the same way out. Unless some unwary fool leans too far from a window...\u0027\\n\\n As he paused his eyes because suspicious again. \u0027And did your father tell you that the Ferengi had men?\u0027\\n\\n Thibor\u0027s father had told him nothing, of course. Nor had the Vlad, for that matter. What little he knew was superstitious twaddle he\u0027d had from a fellow at court, a foolish man who didn\u0027t much care for the prince and who in turn was little cared for. Thibor had no time for ghosts: he knew how many men he\u0027d killed, and not a man of them had come back to haunt him.\\n\\n He decided to take a chance. He\u0027d already learned much of what he wanted to know. \u0027My father said only that the way was steep, and that when he was there, many men were camped in and about the castle.\u0027\\n\\n The old man stared at him, slowly nodded. \u0027It could be, it could be. The Szgany have often wintered with him.\u0027 He came to a decision. \u0027Very well, I will take you up - if he will see you.\u0027 He laughed at Thibor\u0027s raised eyebrows, led him out of the house into the quiet of the afternoon. On their way the gypsy took a huge bronze frying pan from its peg.\\n\\n A weak sun was poised, preparing itself for setting over the grey peaks. The mountains brought an early twilight here, where already the birds were singing their evening songs. \u0027We are in time,\u0027 the old man nodded. \u0027And now we must hope that we are seen.\u0027\\n\\n He pointed steeply upwards at the looming mountains, to where a high, jagged black crest etched itself against the grey of the ultimate peaks. \u0027You see there, where the darkness is deepest?\u0027\\n\\n Thibor nodded.\\n\\n That\u0027s the castle. Now watch.\u0027 He polished the bottom of the pan on his sleeve, then turned it towards the sun. Catching the weak rays, he threw them back into the mountains and traced a line of gold up the crags. Fainter and fainter the disc of light flickered with distance, jumping from scree to flat rock face, from fangs to fir clump, from trees back to crumbling shale as it climbed ever higher. And finally it seemed to Thibor that the ray was answered; for when at last the gypsy held the pan stiffly in his gnarled hands, suddenly that dark, angular outcrop he\u0027d pointed out seemed to burst into golden fire! The lance of light was so sudden, so blinding, that the Wallach threw up his hands before his eyes and peered through the bars of his fingers.\\n\\n \u0027Is that him?\u0027 he gasped. \u0027Is it the Boyar himself who answers?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The old Ferengi?\u0027 The gypsy laughed uproariously. Carefully he propped up the pan on a flat rock, and still the beam of light glanced down from on high. \u0027No, not him. The sun\u0027s no friend of his. Nor any mirror, for that matter!\u0027 He laughed again, and then explained. \u0027It\u0027s a mirror, burnished bright, one of several which sit above the rear wall of the keep where it meets the cliff. Now, if our signal is seen, someone will cover the mirror - which merely shoots back our beam - and the light will be snuffed out. Not gradually, as by the sun\u0027s slow descent, but all at once - like that!\u0027\\n\\n Like a candle snuffed, the beam blinked out, leaving Thibor almost staggering in what seemed a preternatural gloom. He steadied himself. \u0027So, it would seem you\u0027ve established contact,\u0027 he said. \u0027Plainly the Boyar has seen that you have something to convey, but how will he know what it is?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He will know,\u0027 said the gypsy. He grasped Thibor\u0027s arm, stared up into the high passes. A glaze came suddenly over the old man\u0027s eyes and he swayed. Thibor held him up. And:\\n\\n \u0027There, now he knows,\u0027 the old man whispered. The film went from his wide eyes.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Thibor was puzzled; he felt troubled. The Szgany were queer folk with little-understood powers. \u0027What do you mean when you say - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027And now he will answer \"yes\" - or \"no\",\u0027 the gypsy cut him off. Even as he finished speaking there came a single, searing beam of light from the high castle, which in the next moment died away.\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 the old gypsy sighed. \u0027And his answer is \"yes\", he will see you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When?\u0027 Thibor accepted the strangeness of it, fought down the eagerness in his voice.\\n\\n \u0027Now. We set off at once. The mountains are dangerous at night, but he\u0027ll have it no other way. Are you still game?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll not disappoint him, now that he\u0027s invited me,\u0027 said Thibor.\\n\\n \u0027Very well. But wrap yourself well, Wallach. It gets cold up there.\u0027 The old man fixed him with a brief, bright, penetrating stare. \u0027Aye, cold as death...\u0027\\n\\n Thibor chose a pair of burly Wallachs to accompany him. Most of his men were out of his old homeland, but he\u0027d personally stood alongside these two in his war with the Pechenegi, and he knew they were fierce fighters. He wanted real men at his back when he went up against this Ferenczy. And it could well be that he\u0027d need them. Arvos, the old gypsy, had said the Boyar had no retainers; who, then, had answered the mirror signal? No, Thibor couldn\u0027t see a rich man living up there all alone with a mere woman or two, fetching and carrying for himself. Old Arvos lied.\\n\\n In the event that there was only a handful of men up in the mountains with their master... But it was no good speculating, Thibor would have to wait and see what were the odds. If there were many men, however, then he would say that he came as an envoy of Vladimir, to invite the Boyar to the palace in Kiev. It would be in connection with the war against the Pechenegi. Either way, his course was now set: he had a mountain to climb, and at the top a man to kill, depending on conditions.\\n\\n In those days Thibor had been in a way naive; it had not once crossed his mind that the Vlad had sent him on a suicide mission, from which he was not expected to return to Kiev.\\n\\n As for the climb: at first the going had been easy, and this despite the fact that the way was unmarked. The track (there was no real track, merely a route which the old gypsy knew by heart) climbed a saddle between foothills to the base of an unscalable cliff, then followed a rising apron of sliding scree to a wide crevice or chimney in the cliff, which elevated steeply through a fissure on to a false plateau beneath a second line of even steeper hills. These hills were wild and wooded, their trees massive and ancient, but by now Thibor had seen that indeed there was a path of sorts. It was as if some giant had taken a scythe and cut a straight line through the trees; their wood had doubtless provided much of the village\u0027s timber, and perhaps some of it had been hauled up into the mountains for use in the construction of the castle. That might possibly have been hundreds of years ago, and yet no new trees had grown up to bar the way. Or if they had, then someone had uprooted them to keep the path free.\\n\\n Whichever, the climb along the track through the rising woods was fairly easy going, and as twilight grew towards night a full moon rose to lend the way its silvery light. Spying their breath for the climbing, the three men and heir guide spoke not at all and Thibor was able to turn his mind to what little he\u0027d heard of the Boyar Ferenczy from his foppish court contact.\\n\\n The Greeks fear him more than Vladimir does,\u0027 that loose-tongue had informed. \u0027In Greek-land they\u0027ve long sought all such out and put them down. They call such as the Ferenczy \"vrykolax\", which is the same as the Bulgar-ian \"obour\" or \"mouphour\" - or \"wampir\"!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard of the wampir,\u0027 Thibor had answered. They have the same myth, and the same name for it, in my old country. A peasant supersition. And I\u0027ll tell you some-thing: the men I\u0027ve killed rot in their graves, if indeed they have graves. They certainly don\u0027t bloat there! Or if they do it\u0027s from rotten gasses, not the blood of the living!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nevertheless this Ferenczy is said to be just such a creature,\u0027 Thibor\u0027s informant had insisted. \u0027I\u0027ve heard the Greek priests talking: saying how there\u0027s no room in any Christian land for such as that. In Greek-land they put stakes through their hearts and cut off their heads. Or better still, they break them up entirely and burn all the pieces. They believe that even a small part of a wampir can grown whole again in the body of an unwary man. The thing is like a leech, but on the inside! Hence the saying that a wampir has two hearts and two souls - and that the creature may not die until both facets are destroyed.\u0027\\n\\n Thibor had smiled, humourlessly, scornfully. He\u0027d thanked the man, saying, \u0027Well, wizard or witch or whatever, he\u0027s lived long enough. Vladimir the Prince wants this Ferenczy dead, and I\u0027ve been given the job.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lived long enough!\u0027 the other had repeated, throwing up his hands. \u0027Aye, and you don\u0027t know how true that is. Why, there\u0027s been a Ferenczy up in those mountains as long as men remember. And the legends have it that it\u0027s the same Ferenczy! Now you tell me, Wallach, what sort of man is it who watches years pass like hours, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Thibor had laughed at that, too; but now, thinking back on it - several things connected, it seemed.\\n\\n The \u0027Moupho\u0027 in the name of the village, for instance -which sounded a lot like \u0027mouphour\u0027, or wampir. \u0027Village of the Old Ferenczy Vampire\u0027? And what was it Arvos the Szgany had said? \u0027The sun\u0027s no friend of his. Nor any mirror, for that matter!\u0027 Weren\u0027t vampires things of the night; afraid of mirrors because they showed no reflection, or perhaps a reflection more nearly the reality? Then the Wallach gave a snort of derision at his own imaginings. It was this old place, that was all, working on his imagina-tion. These centuried woods and ageless mountains...\\n\\n At which point his party came out of the trees and on to the crest of domed hills where the soil was thin as a whisper and only the lichens grew; beyond which, in a shallow depression, a jumbled plain of stony rubble and brittle scree reached perhaps half a mile to the inky shadows of dark cliffs. To the north it reached up high, that black boundary, forming horns; and to these horns in the light of the moon, old Arvos now pointed a crooked finger.\\n\\n There!\u0027 He chuckled as at some joke. There broods the house of the old Ferengi.\u0027\\n\\n Thibor looked - and sure enough he saw distant win-dows lit like eyes in the darkness under the horns. And it was for all the world as if some monstrous bat squatted there in the heights, or maybe the lord of all great wolves.\\n\\n \u0027Like eyes in a face of stone,\u0027 growled one of Thibor\u0027s Wallachs, a man all chest and arms, with short stumpy legs.\\n\\n \u0027And not the only eyes watching us!\u0027 whispered the other, a thin, hunched man who always went with his head aggressively forward.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that you say?\u0027 Thibor was at once alert, casting about in the darkness. Then he saw the feral, triangular eyes, like blobs of gold, seeming to hang suspended in the darkness at the edge of the woods. Five pairs of eyes: wolves\u0027 eyes, surely?\\n\\n \u0027Ho!\u0027 Thibor shouted. He unsheathed his sword, stepped forward. \u0027Away, dogs of the woods! We\u0027ve nothing for you.\u0027\\n\\n The eyes blinked sporadically in pairs, drew back, scattered. Four lean, grey shapes loped off, flowing under the moon like liquid, lost in the jumble of boulders on the plain of scree. But the fifth pair of eyes remained, seemed to gain height, floated forward out of the darkness without hesitation.\\n\\n A man stepped from the shadows, as tall as, if not taller than, Thibor himself.\\n\\n Arvos the gypsy staggered, seemed about to faint. The moon showed his face a ghastly, silvery-grey. The stranger reached out a hand and gripped his shoulder, stared deep into his eyes. And slowly the old man straightened up and the trembling went out of him.\\n\\n In the manner of the warrior born, Thibor had placed himself in striking distance. His sword was still in his hand, but the stranger was only one man. Thibor\u0027s men -astounded at first, perhaps even a little afraid - were on the point of drawing their own weapons but he stopped them with a word, sheathed his sword. If anything, this was a simple show of defiance, a gesture which in one move showed his strength and possibly his contempt. Certainly it showed his fearlessness. \u0027Who are you?\u0027 he said. \u0027You come like a wolf in the night.\u0027\\n\\n The newcomer was slender, almost fragile-seeming. He was dressed all in black, with a heavy black cape draped about his shoulders and falling to below his knees. There could be weapons concealed under the cape, but he kept his hands in view, resting them on his thighs. He now ignored old Arvos, looked at the three Wallachs. His dark eyes merely fell upon Thibor\u0027s henchmen and moved on, but they rested on Thibor himself for long moments before he answered: \u0027I am from the house of the Ferenczy. My master sent me out to see what manner of men would visit him this night.\u0027 He smiled a thin smile. His voice had a soothing effect on the Voevod; strangely, his unblinking eyes also, which now reflected moonlight. Thibor found himself wishing there was more natural light. There was that about the features of this one which repulsed him. He felt that he gazed upon a misshapen skull, and wondered that this didn\u0027t disturb him more. But he was held as by some mysterious attraction, like a moth to the devouring flame. Yes, attracted and repulsed at one and the same time.\\n\\n As that idea dawned - that he was falling under some strange malaise or enticement - he drew himself more upright, forced himself to speak. \u0027You may tell your master I\u0027m a Wallach. Also that I come to speak of important things, of summonses and responsibilities.\u0027\\n\\n The man in the cape drew closer and the moon shone fully in his face. It was a man\u0027s face after all and not a skull, but there was that which was wolfish about it, an almost freakish longness of jaws and ears. \u0027My master supposed it might be so,\u0027 he said, a certain hard edge creeping into his voice. \u0027But no matter - what will be will be, and you are but a messenger. Before you pass this point, however, which is a boundary, my master must be sure that you come of your own free will.\u0027\\n\\n Thibor had regained his self-control. \u0027No one dragged me up here,\u0027 he snorted.\\n\\n \u0027But you were sent...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A strong man may only be \"sent\" where he wishes to go,\u0027 the Wallach answered.\\n\\n \u0027And your men?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re with Thibor,\u0027 said the hunched one. \u0027Where he ventures, we venture - willingly!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Even to see one who sends out wolves to do his bidding,\u0027 Thibor\u0027s second companion, the apish one, added.\\n\\n \u0027Wolves?\u0027 The stranger frowned and cocked his head on one side quizzically. He glanced sharply all about, then smiled his amusement. \u0027My master\u0027s dogs, you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dogs?\u0027 Thibor was certain he\u0027d seen wolves. Now, however, the idea seemed ridiculous.\\n\\n \u0027Aye, dogs. They came out to walk with me, for it\u0027s a fine night. But they\u0027re not used to strangers. See, they\u0027ve run off home.\u0027\\n\\n Thibor nodded, and eventually he said: \u0027So, you\u0027ve come to meet us half-way, then. To walk with us and show us the way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not I,\u0027 the other shook his head. \u0027Arvos can do that well enough. I came only to greet you and to count your numbers - also to ensure that your presence here was not forced. Which is to say, that you came of your own free mind and will.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I say again,\u0027 Thibor growled, \u0027who could force me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There are pressures and there are pressures,\u0027 the other shrugged. \u0027But I see you are your own man.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mentioned our numbers.\u0027\\n\\n The man in the cape raised his eyebrows. They peaked like gables. \u0027For your accommodation,\u0027 he answered. \u0027What else?\u0027 And before Thibor could reply: \u0027Now I must go on ahead - to make preparation.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d hate to crowd your master\u0027s house,\u0027 said Thibor quickly. \u0027Bad enough to be an unexpected guest, but worse far if others are obliged to vacate their rightful positions to make room for me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, there\u0027s room enough,\u0027 the other answered. \u0027And\\n\\n you were not entirely unexpected. As for putting others out: my master\u0027s house is a castle, but it shelters fewer human souls than you have here.\u0027 It was as if he\u0027d read Thibor\u0027s mind and answered the question he\u0027d found there.\\n\\n Now he inclined his head towards the old Szgany. \u0027Be warned, however, that the path along the cliff is loose and the way a little perilous. Be on your guard for rock falls!\u0027 And once more to Thibor he said, \u0027Until later, then.\u0027\\n\\n They watched him turn and make off after his master\u0027s \u0027dogs\u0027 across the narrow, jumbled, boulder-strewn plain.\\n\\n When he\u0027d gone into the shadows, Thibor grabbed Arvos by the neck. \u0027No retainers?\u0027 he hissed into the old gypsy\u0027s face. \u0027No servants? What, and are you a simple liar or a very great liar? The Ferenczy could harbour an army up there!\u0027\\n\\n Arvos tried to snatch himself back and found the Wallach\u0027s grip like iron on his throat. \u0027A ... a manservant or two,\u0027 he choked. \u0027How was... was I to know? It\u0027s been many a year...\u0027 Thibor released him, thrust him away.\\n\\n \u0027Old man,\u0027 he warned, \u0027if you\u0027d see another day, just be sure you guide us carefully along this perilous cliff path.\u0027 And so they had crossed the stony depression to the cliff, and started up the narrow way carved in its sheer face... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-ii-wamphyri-necroscope-2/page-2.html","bookId":2117,"book":{"id":2117,"title":"Necroscope II: Wamphyri (Necroscope #2)","description":"Storyline: The spirit of Harry Keogh now resides in his son, Harry Jr. When his infant son sleeps, Harry can roam the Continuum and speak to the dead, but is gradually losing his control as the son \"reels\" his father\u0027s spirit back in.
