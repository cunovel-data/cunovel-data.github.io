{"id":82632,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Lucas and I argue for what seems like an eternity before he clasps his hands together almost demurely and tells me to go pick up his dinner. By time I return from the part of town we\u0027ve just came from, he\u0027s already dressed to go out to Jessica\u0027s parents\u0027 bar.\n I\u0027ve got to give him credit - he\u0027s managed to perfect his disguise. And I have a feeling that\u0027s all thanks to the fact that in Los Angeles, he doesn\u0027t get to enjoy the peace he\u0027s found in Nashville. During the video shoot for \"All Over You\" there were daily incidents of fangirls (and fanboys) finding ways to sneak themselves on set to try and hook up with members of the band, not to mention the diehard Your Toxic Sequel fans who\u0027d camped outside the studio every day to get a glimpse of Lucas and the rest of the guys.\n Tonight, Lucas is wearing his usual jeans, but instead of boots, he\u0027s got on old school Converse shoes. A black and white Henley covers every last one of his tattoos. His messy hair is covered by an oversized black beanie and he\u0027s wearing . . . glasses. Nerdy ones at that.\n I stand at the door to his office for a moment, taking in the sight of him. No man should look that sexy in nerdy glasses.\n \"Borrowed from wardrobe?\" I ask, making his head jerk up toward me. He bites his bottom lip and instinctively, I nibble mine too. \"The glasses, I mean.\"\n He beckons me to come into the office and I comply, sitting the Styrofoam platter of food on the desk. Up close to him, I realize that those glasses have to be - hands down - the sexiest thing I\u0027ve ever seen him wear.\n He laughs, \"Not borrowed. A nearsighted bitch.\"\n \"You look . . . rocker geek.\"\n Tilting his head to one side, he considers what I said for a moment then bites the tip of his tongue to suppress a grin. \"You\u0027re not going to take pics and send them to the paparazzi, are you?\" he teases.\n \"Only if you\u0027re doing this to humiliate my friend\u0027s boyfriend,\" I say. \"You\u0027re not, are you?\"\n He\u0027s on his feet and towering over me an instant later, his eyes unreadable. \"I\u0027d never hurt my fans. There the reason I\u0027m here and not in Atlanta strung out on something. But to answer your question . . . I\u0027ve got a soft spot for cover bands.\"\n \"Why?\" I ask.\n \"Google\u0027s your friend,\" he says, winking at me. \"Now go get dressed - your clothes are on your bed.\"\n I move to go and do what he\u0027s asked me to, but then ice travels down my body, freezing me. What am I doing? This is the first time he\u0027s issued me a command where my mind automatically compelled me to follow it, and that\u0027s a realization that frightens me.\n \"You want to get me dressed, too, Mr. Wolfe?\" I demand, forcing a sugary smile when I say his name.\n He rakes his teeth over his bottom lip, and then blows a stray strand of hair away from my neck. \"God, if only. You\u0027re thinking about it, aren\u0027t you? We\u0027re only three days in, and you already want to give in to me.\" Despite his words, there\u0027s not the slightest hint of mockery behind his voice. It\u0027s teasing - yes - but so full of promise. I back up until the desk hits my bottom. My fingers curl around the wood.\n \"If I did?\" I whisper breathlessly.\n He thinks for a moment and then grants me a look that\u0027s so delicious it sends heat spiraling through me. \"At this point I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027d fuck you or spank you with that drumstick over there.\" He motions to a set of signed sticks on the opposite end of the desk. \"Maybe both. Maybe just tie you to a chair and taste you \u0027til you can\u0027t move or think or breathe.\"\n \"And after?\"\n \"There are seven more days,\" he reminds me. \"There\u0027s so much I can teach you, so much we can do, and after that . . .\"\n I roll my eyes, but I can\u0027t deny that he\u0027s affected me by what he\u0027s said and the way he\u0027s looking at me. It should be illegal for any man to have such a magnetic, irresistible effect. \"I\u0027m good,\" I say.\n \"For now.\"\n \"No, for - \" In twenty years if you ask me who initiated the kiss, I still wouldn\u0027t be able to tell you. It\u0027s that sudden, that breathtaking, and all-consuming. Lucas\u0027s tongue glides across my lips, tracing the outline of them - once, twice, a third time and then once more. I cry out and my backside slumps onto the desk behind me because my legs are trembling so violently. He makes a noise that\u0027s part curse, part moan, and enough to send me over the edge. I splay my hands out on either side of his chest, digging my fingertips into the soft fabric of shirt, into his skin, and pulling him to my body.\n His hands are locked behind his head because he\u0027s so determined to make me beg before he uses them on me.\n My lips part easily the moment his tongue probes the space between them. I\u0027m wet. Wet and moaning and rubbing my body against his. Yet he still doesn\u0027t move his hands.\n Touch me. Touch me. But I can\u0027t bring myself to give into him. Not yet.\n When he drags his mouth away from mine, I catch his lower lip gently between my teeth. He winces as my teeth rake over the tender flesh before releasing it. Then a sexy smile creeps across his face. \"You a biter, Red?\"\n He knows I hate it when he calls me Red, just like he knows he\u0027s gotten me too flustered to complain at the moment. \"Lucas?\" I murmur against the side of his mouth. Suddenly brave, I kiss his upper lip, his strong chin. I draw his lower lip between my own and suck it.\n \"Mmmhmm?\"\n I lean back and gaze up into his hazel eyes. \"Is it really inescapable - this . . . us?\" I challenge, running my hands down the front of his chest. He trembles.\n \"Always has been.\"\n Our mouths meet one last time. I can\u0027t fight the temptation to skim the tip of my tongue across my lips, tasting the places he touched me after he pulls away, reluctantly. \"Go on and get dressed - no shower, leave your hair down. Don\u0027t even think about fucking yourself.\"\n I turn to leave the office and go to my bedroom, but a thought occurs to me. Glancing over my shoulder, I speak again, my voice so low I can barely even hear myself. \"Why\u0027d you remember me? Why when you fucked so many of the others?\"\n \"Because you\u0027re the one I didn\u0027t.\"\n A few minutes later, when I\u0027m in my bedroom shrugging on my clothes and staring into the bathroom at the bathtub I\u0027ve been forbidden to use, I decide I\u0027m satisfied with his response.\n Before I leave the bedroom, I let my hair fall loose.\n Jessica\u0027s parents\u0027 bar - a little dive called The Beacon - is filled to capacity when Lucas and I show up. I\u0027m ready to turn around and head back to the Cadillac when the big, red-bearded doorman tells us we\u0027ll have to wait, but Lucas shakes his head. \"Get us in now,\" he says.\n Of course that\u0027s an easy order for him to give. All he\u0027s done since we stepped out of the vehicle is shove his hands into the back pockets of his jeans and look down at the ground so as not to be noticed. He was right when he swore up and down that nobody would recognize him, though. He exudes shyness, the complete opposite of the Lucas I know, and irritatingly similar to myself.\n \"You should be in movies,\" I hiss as I stalk back toward the door with him in tow. \"Mr. - \"\n He stops me with a promise I\u0027m certain he\u0027ll actually keep. \"Say it and I swear the second you do I\u0027ll spank your ass with those drumsticks.\"\n Tossing my hair over one shoulder I gaze back at him, grinning. \"Sir.\"\n \"If only you were this sarcastic and infuriatingly confident with everyone you meet,\" he points out, as we come back up to the doorman again. Red Beard rolls his eyes and tilts his chin to one side. Mimicking my best Lucas impression, I place my hands on my hips. There\u0027s not enough lighting out here for him to be able to see how my fingers are nervously working the thick fabric of my black skinny jeans.\n \"I\u0027ve got a personal invitation from\" - then, I see Jessica\u0027s small body grinding on the dance floor several feet away, and I take in a deep breath. Screw it - \"Jess! Hey, over here!\" I yell at the top of my lungs. Several people passing by turn to cock eyebrows at me, but the yelling works. Jessica pushes her way through the throng of people in the bar and pokes her head out the door.\n She gives the doorman a pouty look. \"You\u0027re not being a dick, are you, Nicky? She\u0027s with me.\"\n Begrudgingly, Nicky stamps my and Lucas\u0027s hands and moves his giant body aside so we can go in. I almost want to give him a triumphant smile but even a small victory isn\u0027t enough for me to press my luck.\n Hundreds of Your Toxic Sequel fans surround us - their hips swaying and their sweaty bodies gliding together. I glance up at Lucas. His eyes are still downcast, but his face says it all. He\u0027s in heaven right now, witnessing all these people who\u0027ve come out to pay homage to his band.\n How much cockier can he get?\n Jessica finds the only empty table in the whole place and leads us to it. \"Here, sit here and I\u0027ll go and get you - \"\n \"I\u0027m good,\" I say, and she gives me a skeptical look. \"I\u0027m DD.\"\n \"Sam Adams,\" Lucas says in a very deep voice that makes me give a tiny snort.\n Jessica grins, bows her back a little and tilts her head trying to get a good view of his face. When he tucks his chin closer to his chest, she purses her lips and stalks off.\n \"This isn\u0027t going to work.\" I warn him and he glances up at me.\n \"Well, no. It typically never does.\"\n Feeling my temperature rise, I study him. He\u0027s so full of contradictions. One minute he\u0027s talking about wanting peace and quiet and the next he\u0027s craving the adoration that comes with his world, his fame. It\u0027s enough to make my head dizzy. When I gather up the courage and say this to him, he grins.\n \"I just wanted enough peace to finish my solo project and I\u0027ve - \" His voice breaks off and he traces a heart that someone has carved into the table.\n \"You\u0027ve what?\"\n Snapping his hazel eyes up, he tells me in a barely controlled voice, \"I\u0027ve written enough goddamn material on it the past few days for two or three albums.\"\n \"Ah . . . I see.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think you do.\"\n Confused and tired of playing a game of words with him, I change the subject back to his reasons for wanting to come here tonight. \"So why risk being noticed and groped by your fangirls just to see a cover band?\"\n \"You never Googled it, I see.\"\n I shake my head. \"It wasn\u0027t a direct order, sir.\"\n His face breaks out into a smile and he tilts his head back and laughs. It\u0027s one of those full-bodied expressions that sends warmth pouring into my belly. \"God you\u0027re so frustrating it\u0027s fucking with my head.\" He regains control, slumping down in his chair and getting an unfocused look in his eyes. \"When I was in high school, me and Sinjin Fields and Wyatt McCrae had this god-awful cover band. It was how we were discovered eventually - us and Cilla.\"\n Cilla. Why do I feel a pang of jealousy every time I hear or see her name? It\u0027s ridiculous because I\u0027ve never met her - all I know is that she and Lucas are friends. What exactly the word \"friend\" entails I\u0027m not sure nor do I think I ever want to find out.\n \"So you\u0027re here to discover Jessica\u0027s boyfriend?\" I question.\n He shrugs, and corrects me, \"I\u0027m here to say I appreciate them.\" Then his eyebrows knot together. \"But I\u0027ve got to admit, they\u0027re really fucking awesome and I don\u0027t mind dropping their names to a few of my contacts.\"\n Lucas\u0027s drink slides across the table and he looks up, meeting Jessica\u0027s curious stare. \"I knew it was you,\" she whispers excitedly. She plops down in the chair beside me, directly across from him. I watch fascinated because she\u0027s on the verge of salivating and her eyes are practically glittering under the dim lights.\n \"Before or after you eavesdropped on the last minute of what we were saying?\" he demands, taking a giant swig of his beer.\n Jessica\u0027s naturally tan skinned flushes but then she quickly regains composure. \"Sorry about that, but. . . . Dude, you\u0027re Lucas-Fucking-Wolfe. You\u0027re in my parents bar and sitting at table with me and I\u0027m about to freak out.\" The way she says his name, whispering it reverently brings out the panty-slaying smile. Turning to me, Jessica says in an accusing voice, \"You didn\u0027t tell me you know him.\"\n \"He\u0027s my boss,\" I murmur.\n \"Your work involves going out to bars with him at 10 at night. Ugh . . . I need to become a wardrobe person. I\u0027m in the wrong field, I - \" Then she bites her bottom lip. \"You\u0027re going to play, right?\"\n \"Wait, he\u0027s - \" I start but Lucas shoots me a warning stare.\n \"Fuck yeah.\"\n I\u0027ve got no other choice but follow them as they weave their way through the crowd toward the front of the bar where the band is rocking out to \"Lucky You\u0027re Wasted.\" Jessica bounces on the balls of her feet as she waits impatiently for them to finish up. When they\u0027re through, she waves the bassist over to her. He bends his head, attempting to brush his lips across her lips but she shakes her head, too excited to deal with her boyfriend. I watch as her lips move rapidly and she gestures over to me and Lucas.\n His eyes widen - and I swear to this - at least three sides. After he gets over the momentary disbelief, he nods and crosses the stage to have a powwow with the rest of the band. At some point, I can clearly hear one of them say \"Holy fucking yes.\"\n The crowd\u0027s going crazy at this point, wondering what\u0027s up, if the band is calling it quits early but then the lead singer saunters back up to the microphone. He\u0027s grinning and his voice is shaking as he gives Lucas the only introduction someone like him needs: \"It\u0027s the real Lucas-fucking-Wolfe, people!\"\n For a moment, everyone in the audience is utterly unclear of what\u0027s going on and they\u0027re hushed, murmuring among themselves. But as Lucas strides across stage, taking the lead\u0027s guitar and bowing his head graciously, the silence turns from confused to stunned. Lucas calls out \"All Over You\" and then the hell-raising guitar intro begins.\n Nicky, the giant grumpy doorman, and another bouncer who Jessica says keeps watch over the bar make their way to the stage, but none of Lucas\u0027s fans tries to bum rush him or anything. Everyone\u0027s too entranced by the music, myself included.\n I\u0027m so spellbound that it takes me a moment to realize that at certain lines of the song, Lucas\u0027s eyes drag to the far left of the stage, seeking me out. Making me feel like I\u0027m the only person in this crowded bar. When I grind my teeth together in frustration, Lucas\u0027s eyes narrow a fraction and he shakes his head slowly to each side.\n Drawing in a deep breath, I do the only other thing I can do. I sing along with the rest of the crowd. I ignore the wetness that has built up in the lacy black panties I\u0027m wearing.\n Panties that Lucas himself had touched and laid out for me to put on. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-11.html","bookId":1869,"book":{"id":1869,"title":"Devoured (Devoured #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Devoured (Devoured #1) \n Sienna\u0027s dreams lie in California, but when she discovers her grandmother\u0027s Nashville home has been foreclosed, she has no other choice but to move back to Music City, where she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she\u0027d see again - and who now holds the deed to her grandma\u0027s estate.
