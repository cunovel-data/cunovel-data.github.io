The sound of the hotel room\u0027s telephone shrilling in our ears is what drags us out of bed at a little after nine. I answer the phone, and I\u0027m greeted by a chilly female voice.\n \"Kylie, put Lucas on the phone, it\u0027s Sam.\"\n Sam. I try to remember where I\u0027ve heard the name and then I realize this is the person Lucas\u0027s mother had mentioned yesterday, the person who made him tense up in anger. And she\u0027s a woman. I bite my bottom lip, clutching the phone until I feel like I\u0027m seconds away from shattering it.\n \"I\u0027m sorry you - \"\n \"Don\u0027t you dare try that I\u0027m sorry you\u0027ve reached the wrong room act with me. I talked to your mom, so put him on the goddamn phone.\"\n Lucas is sitting up in bed now, staring down at the receiver with a blank expression on his face. \"It\u0027s Sam,\" I say, hoping to elicit some kind of reaction from him. Nothing happens and a chill turns my blood to ice.\n He takes the phone from my hands, grasping it as tight as I had only moments before. \"Leave,\" he says. There\u0027s no cruelty behind it or any emotion at all, for that matter, but I feel numb as I slide off the bed. Leave the room. Draw the door closed behind me.\n I sit in the living room, hugging my knees to my chest. I try to focus on watching television - some trashy talk show about a woman and the six men who were possibly her \"baby\u0027s daddy\" - but I can still hear bits and pieces of Lucas\u0027s conversation with Sam. Every snippet that reaches my ears only intensifies the cramps in my chest.\n \" . . . you can\u0027t keep doing this to me,\" he yells.\n Then there\u0027s silence for a little while. I pretend like I\u0027m interested in the woman on the giant, flat-screen TV weeping at another negative test result. I pretend like I\u0027m not at all spying on Lucas.\n \". . . it\u0027s nobody, just - \" He pauses, and I can hear a guttural noise rip from his throat. \"I\u0027m sending you money. I\u0027ll send you whatever you want, but you can\u0027t expect me to do this with you for the rest of my life.\"\n I flinch. Is Lucas in some sort of trouble with Sam? And then, a more frightening thought comes to me: is Lucas involved with drugs, just like Sinjin? I wipe sweaty palms on the hem of the t-shirt I\u0027m wearing, Lucas\u0027s shirt.\n And then, I hear him say something that makes me shudder.\n \"You psycho bitch, sometimes I wish you would just go to them and get it over with.\"\n Go to whom? Get what over with?\n I hear the sound of something slamming repeatedly followed by the pipes in the bathroom turning on. When Lucas comes out of the shower nearly an hour later, there\u0027s a blood-stained towel wrapped around his knuckles.\n \"Lucas . . . is everything alright?\" I whisper, hesitantly.\n He gives me a strained smile and then motions me to him. \"Come here,\" he says, pulling him to me.\n He covers my lips with his mouth, drowning out all the questions I have. He kisses me like I\u0027m his last meal, like he\u0027s never tasted me before, even though he had me many, many times last night. He pulls me into his lap and slides his finger into my mouth, between our lips. I nibble on the tip of it.\n A moment later he stands, with me straddling him, and carries me back to the bedroom. There, he keeps his promise of eating strawberries and me. There, he finally gets the chance to cuff me, turning me over on my stomach and sliding his cock in and out of my body until I\u0027m sobbing.\n And it\u0027s there that I come to terms with the fact that I\u0027ve fallen in love with Lucas Wolfe.\n My dress for Cilla\u0027s birthday party is the sexiest piece of clothing I\u0027ve ever owned. It\u0027s short and black, made of scalloped lace with a cutout back. When Lucas sees me in it, his eyes darken and he promises me that tonight, my dress will become binds for each of the four posters of the bed.\n I get wet just thinking about it.\n Cilla\u0027s party is being held at a swanky night club, and I immediately recognize several of her guests from Fuse TV and my iPod playlists. Any other person would be star struck but I\u0027m not. I only have eyes for Lucas. I play my part well, standing by his side as his personal assistant, but wanting him more than anything.\n When nobody\u0027s looking, he drags me into a corner with him, kissing me deeply and sucking on my ear. He wiggles his fingers inside of me, causing me to almost lose control on the spot.\n \"Soon,\" he promises.\n When Cilla\u0027s boyfriend, the bass guitarist for an up and coming band from Ohio, seeks Lucas out, I excuse myself to go to the bathroom. As I\u0027m passing an empty lounge, a long-nailed hand closes around my wrist, slamming me up against a wall. I expect to see Cilla - she\u0027s been prancing around drunk off her ass most of the bight - so I\u0027m surprised when a different face hovers in front of me.\n A woman with henna red hair and gray eyes. She\u0027s beautiful, but so are most of the women here tonight. What really strikes me about this particular woman are her eyes. They\u0027re unfocused and wild. Scary. \"So you\u0027re Luke\u0027s little bitch?\" she demands between clenched teeth, pressing all of her body weight - which isn\u0027t very much considering she\u0027s short and skinny - against me.\n \"I\u0027m his personal assistant,\" I say. But even then, the word doesn\u0027t sound quite right or believable.\n She opens her mouth to say something but then her face changes from furious to a look of understanding. \"That wasn\u0027t Kylie this morning, was it?\"\n I suck in a deep breath through my nose. \"Sam?\" I blurt out.\n Her lips curl up into a sneer, and she bobs her head. \"If you go near him again, I swear to God I\u0027ll ruin you,\" she says. \"I swear to God I\u0027ll - \"\n \"You\u0027ll what?\" I demand, shoving her away from me. \"And just who are you anyway?\"\n \"I\u0027ll ruin him,\" she promises, choosing not to answer my second question.\n That feeling of dread that I felt when Lucas was on the phone with this woman comes back to me, hitting me hard, and it\u0027s impossible to get it to go away this time. Who the hell is she? And what does she have on Lucas that lets her provoke such a nasty response from him? That gives her enough courage to threaten me?\n \"Stay the fuck away from me,\" I warn, brushing her aside so I can leave. She grabs my arm again, this time, raking her nails into my skin. This time, I slam her up against the wall. So hard that the back of her head makes a loud thumping noise.\n She laughs like a crazy person, shaking her head from side to side, and saying, \"You have no idea who you\u0027re talking to, slut.\"\n \"Hey!\" a voice shouts out. Both of our heads snap to see Cilla standing in the doorway, her eyes squinted and a shot glass in each hand. \"What the fuck are you doing in here?\" She touches the earpiece that she\u0027s wearing, hissing \"Security!\"\n I almost expect Cilla to have me escorted away by the two bouncers who come back just moments after they\u0027re called, but instead, it\u0027s Sam she tells to literally fuck off and burn in hell. Sam gives me one last look, shrugs off the bouncers, and stalks off.\n I rub my hand across the spot on my arm her fingers clawed. \"You alright?\" Cilla asks me, and I shake my head.\n \"You know, I\u0027m not your biggest fan because you\u0027re with Luke, but nobody deserves to have to deal with people like Samantha,\" she says.\n \"Who is she to him?\"\n Cilla\u0027s beautiful face is suddenly surprised, but she recovers quickly. \"His ex-wife.\"\n Lucas doesn\u0027t waste any time taking me back to the hotel. It\u0027s another one of those painfully quiet car rides. As we ride the elevator up to our suite, a horrible feeling slinks its way through my chest. As soon as we enter the room, he tells me to sit on the couch. I obey, wringing my hands together.\n \"Sienna . . . I can\u0027t - \" He heaves a sigh and glances away from my face at the marble flooring in the foyer. \"You\u0027ve got to go.\"\n I feel everything inside of me shut down, as he refuses to look into my eyes. \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" I demand at last.\n \"I\u0027m dismissing you. You\u0027ve fulfilled the terms of our contract,\" he says.\n I come up out of my seat, rushing across the room to stand in front of him. \"No. No. I\u0027ve got two days left. Lucas, tell me what\u0027s going on?\" I plead.\n He drags his hands through his thick dark hair and makes a low, violent noise. \"God, Sienna . . . just fucking go, okay? The house is yours. You\u0027re done - just go before I call security on you.\"\n He doesn\u0027t sound like the Lucas I know. He doesn\u0027t sound like anyone I\u0027ve ever known. My heart is beating wildly as I take another tentative step in his direction. He backs up, shaking his head.\n \"So, that\u0027s it?\" I demand, tears rolling down my cheeks, singeing my skin. \"No explanation, no . . . nothing.\"\n \"I\u0027ve given you a house. I don\u0027t fucking owe you anything else,\" he says, his voice cold. I start to argue with him more but he turns his back to me. Clenches his hands - the same hands that touched me so intimately hours before - into tight fists. \"Concierge is taking care of your flight to Nashville. Be out before I return tomorrow.\"\n I\u0027m shaking so hard that\u0027s it\u0027s impossible for me to speak. I hold myself close, wheezing. When the words do come to me, it\u0027s too late.\n He\u0027s already left, slamming the door behind him.\n Slamming the door on us. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-18.html","bookId":1869,"book":{"id":1869,"title":"Devoured (Devoured #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Devoured (Devoured #1) \n Sienna\u0027s dreams lie in California, but when she discovers her grandmother\u0027s Nashville home has been foreclosed, she has no other choice but to move back to Music City, where she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she\u0027d see again - and who now holds the deed to her grandma\u0027s estate.
