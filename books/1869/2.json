{"id":82623,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Seth bails on us the moment we reach the bottom step of the courthouse - he swears he\u0027s got a late afternoon class, but I\u0027m positive that\u0027s total bull. He\u0027s probably just going to drink away his worries. I don\u0027t confirm my suspicions as our grandmother speaks to him, thanking him for being there for her.\\n\\n A razor sharp sensation scrapes the wall of my chest as I once again try to come to terms with the fact Seth knew more about what was going on with Gram than I did. Standing by myself a few feet away from them with snowflakes melting the second they kiss my skin, I feel left out - literally like the redheaded step child. As quick as the thought entered my head, I squash it down. What am I, a jealous ten year old?\\n\\n My brother waves goodbye to me before he takes off in a graceful sprint toward the parking garage where he left the Dodge.\\n\\n Smiling up at me with a grace and fortitude I\u0027ve always been envious of, my grandmother jangles the keys to her ancient black Land Rover in my palm and closes my fist around them.\\n\\n She pulls an umbrella out of her bag and opens it. \"Richard wants me to come to his office for a strategy meeting. I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t want to waste your time in a boring meeting with an attorney.\"\\n\\n I may not return home nearly as often as I should, but I know my grandmother better than just about anyone else. This is her way of telling me she doesn\u0027t want me around for whatever she and Nielson have to say to each other.\\n\\n She doesn\u0027t want me involved.\\n\\n My muscles tighten. I purse my lips into what I hope passes for a good-natured expression. \"Sure. I\u0027ll just\" - I squint at my surroundings until my eyes land on a two-story cafe directly across the street from Nielson\u0027s office and the courthouse - \"go grab something to eat over at Alice\u0027s. I\u0027ll keep an eye out for you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you in a few minutes,\" Gram says. \"And Sienna?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so happy you\u0027ve come home.\"\\n\\n Tears burn the corners of my eyes. I squeeze them shut, whispering, \"Me too, Gram.\" There\u0027s so much else I want to say and do but there are people all around us heading into the courthouse and to various attorneys\u0027 offices. I give her a cheerful wave instead. It\u0027s only after she disappears into Nielson\u0027s building, I let my shoulders slump and drag ass across the street to the cafe.\\n\\n I haven\u0027t been to this restaurant since my mom\u0027s legal woes a few years ago, so I\u0027m stoked to find it\u0027s now decorated in an Alice in Wonderland theme. My roommate and I are complete opposites but one of the places where we find common ground is fantastical movies and books and . . . you know, Johnny Depp.\\n\\n The woman behind the counter wearing an elaborate velvet Hatter hat smiles up at me and yells, \"Go ahead and seat yourself, hon. Someone\u0027ll be right over.\" I nod my head appreciatively and then find a booth in the far left of the cafe that gives me the best view of Nielson\u0027s office and easy access to the wall vent. After I order a double slice of the special - Cheshire pie - and a cup of coffee, I send a series of texts to Tori that sound more than a little neurotic.\\n\\n Lucas Wolfe is the person who\u0027s bought the house. That shitface bought my gram\u0027s house.\\n\\n The universe has to be plotting against me.\\n\\n WTF is he doing here?\\n\\n Tori???\\n\\n There\u0027s slush melting inside of my pumps and I realize I was so distracted by merely seeing Lucas that I forgot to get my bags out of the back of Seth\u0027s truck. Yet now the only thing I can think about is Lucas. Not only about how he\u0027s trying to throw Gram out of her house, but how he threw me out of his.\\n\\n I\u0027m still deep in thought and waiting for Tori to text me back when I hear shuffling beside me. I slide my cell phone from the edge of the table, over toward the salt and pepper shakers to give the waitress room. A large and very unfeminine hand covers mine, calloused fingers from playing the guitar gliding across my knuckles. It\u0027s a familiar touch that sends an unwanted - and very delicious - jolt through my body. I snatch my fingers, angry at my body\u0027s obvious betrayal, and knock over a porcelain bowl full of sugar packets. The sugar scatters across the linoleum. Lucas chuckles.\\n\\n And I feel the sudden urge to vomit.\\n\\n Gesturing to the empty seat across from me, Lucas asks, \"Room for one more?\"\\n\\n \"Not much for spending my free time with strangers,\" I say through clenched teeth as I shake my head. \"So, sorry, there\u0027s not.\"\\n\\n He slides into the booth anyway, stretching out his ridiculously long legs so that his calves straddle mine. I open my mouth to protest, but he holds up his hand. \"Before you try to bullshit me, you should probably know I never forget a face.\" Then, he lifts his eyebrows wickedly and says, \"Or a body.\"\\n\\n Who does he think he is? Feeling a sudden need to come right out and ask him, I demand, \"I guess you\u0027re not used to hearing no, huh?\" My voice packs a hell of a punch, surprising me. If he were anybody else I would have already separated myself from the situation. Lucas has an unnerving way of tearing away the layers of my nervousness, my need to shy away, until I\u0027m raw and wanting to lash out at him.\\n\\n He grins, cocks his head to one side as if he\u0027s carefully studying me. \"You really have to ask me that?\"\\n\\n My lips part as my senses and every inch of my skin flood with heat. I ball up a sugar packet, squishing my thumb and forefinger into the grittiness and glance away from Lucas out the window toward Nielson\u0027s office.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sexy when you\u0027re nervous.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Sexy?\"\\n\\n My head jerks back, away from the window, and I give him a wide-eyed stare. \"No . . . nervous.\" But I\u0027m sure he can hear the tremor in my voice, feel how my legs are shaking beneath the table right now.\\n\\n The corners of his lips pull into a sardonic smile that\u0027s infuriating and ridiculously sexy. Once again, I feel electricity flow through my body. I hate myself for having any response toward this man other than dislike. \"Tell me why you\u0027re here, Sienna,\" he demands softly.\\n\\n \"Why do you care?\"\\n\\n Placing his forearms on the table, he leans forward. His sleeves ride up just enough for me to see the tattoos on his wrists. I squeeze my eyes shut, vividly picturing the rest of the tattoo sleeve on his right arm. Anyone who follows his music would know about it. I mean, he and the drop dead gorgeous female lead singer of Wicked Lambs were on the front cover of some rock magazine a few months back - he was shirtless and so was she, with him standing behind her, cupping her breasts.\\n\\n But in another time, I\u0027d seen Lucas\u0027s ink up close. I\u0027d gotten to trace my lips along the intricate patterns that ran along his muscled body as he wound his fingertips into my hair and whispered for me to kiss, to taste. I shiver. I wish I could say it was from the 33 degree weather.\\n\\n Lucas finally answers me, untangling me from the memories. I hate myself for being disappointed. \"Because being around you is - \" He stops speaking so that the waitress can put my lunch on the table. He grants her his trademark buy-my-album-and-vibe-off-to-it grin. She fumbles, blushing as she asks him if there\u0027s anything she can get him. I frown. If he orders, that means he\u0027ll stick around and really, I just want to hurry this along so Lucas and I can go back to being . . . well, nothing to one another.\\n\\n Luckily for me, he declines.\\n\\n \"Being around me is what?\" I demand the moment we\u0027re alone again.\\n\\n Twirling a spoon around in my coffee, he flicks the tip of his tongue over his top teeth. I can\u0027t tell whether he\u0027s smiling or grimacing. And I have no idea why I should give two shits either way.\\n\\n My cell phone plays the ringtone I\u0027ve assigned it for calls and messages from Tori - a Britney Spears song that she swear she loathes but sings in the shower every morning. I reach for it, but Lucas captures my hand in his, threading his fingertips between mine. \"You could be bad for music,\" he whispers, bringing my fingers to his lips. \"And that\u0027s what I\u0027m here to do - make music.\"\\n\\n My stomach ravels into hundreds of knots as he kisses each of my fingers slowly, his eyes never leaving my own. We\u0027re in public, and there are people all around us. But for a good minute, Lucas Wolfe and I are the only people in the world.\\n\\n \"Lucas - \" I start, my voice threadbare. Staring down at the sugar packet disaster on the table, I take a deep breath and then rake my teeth over my top lip. I don\u0027t know what to say to him so I don\u0027t appear weak. When I glance up in time to see his beautiful face breaks into a smile that makes my chest clench, I realize it doesn\u0027t matter what I say. He\u0027s already realized he\u0027s my Kryptonite.\\n\\n \"The second I saw you, I promised myself I wouldn\u0027t do this with you again, Sienna,\" he growls.\\n\\n Do what - lead me on? Boot me out of his life without so much as a proper goodbye? I\u0027m about to demand an explanation, but then I see the door to Nielson\u0027s office swing open and Gram walks out. I immediately feel like the worse granddaughter in history because at some point during my exchange with Lucas, I managed to forget she\u0027s the reason I\u0027m in this cafe to begin with.\\n\\n Pulling my hand away from Lucas, I toss my phone into my bag with a little too much force. \"I\u0027m here because some douchebag musician from California bought my grandmother\u0027s house.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t mistake his sharp intake of breath or the way his long legs go stiff beneath the table, squeezing my own. \"I see.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027ll understand why I\u0027m saying this: Go fuck yourself, Lucas.\"\\n\\n Our eyes meet. His are mocking and angry and something else. Something that I\u0027d seen two years ago, the night I went home with him. Something I\u0027ll pretend I don\u0027t see. \"I\u0027ve only heard you that forceful once, so I\u0027ve got to ask: Was that for your grandma or for what happened with us?\"\\n\\n I untangle my legs from his, stand, and put money under the untouched platter of Cheshire pie. \"Both,\" I say.\\n\\n I\u0027m so flustered - emotionally, mentally, and dammit, physically - by my encounter with Lucas that I\u0027m only half-tuned in to my conversation with my grandmother on the ride to her house. I hear her ask if my flight was comfortable, how long I\u0027ll be staying in Nashville. I listen to myself respond like a robot. \"It was great, Gram. . . . I\u0027ll be here as long as it takes. . . .\" Then Gram starts asking me a new series of questions, and I give her more mechanical answers. Our entire exchange sounds like a hazy dream to me, but Lucas\u0027s voice plays loud and static-free in my head. It\u0027s teasing me, warning me that I\u0027m bad for music.\\n\\n Whatever that\u0027s supposed to mean. Maybe I inspire him to write angsty music where the rocker doesn\u0027t get to screw the girl, or something. When I think of it that way, I guess that is a career drainer.\\n\\n The only thing I\u0027m entirely sure of is that I wish the person snatching away the home my grandparents loved so much was anyone else in the world but Lucas.\\n\\n Navigating the Land Rover up the narrow hill leading to the house where I spent most of my childhood, I draw my brain away from Lucas Wolfe and back to the most important dilemma.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" I ask quietly. \"You came to L.A. to see me for Christmas, you must\u0027ve known then.\"\\n\\n \"I thought I could fix things. What am I saying? I can still fix things. The last thing I wanted to do was burden you with something that would make you stress.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Gram . . .\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you dare give me that pitying voice, Sienna Jensen. There\u0027s still time left. It\u0027s not over yet,\" she says, her voice hard as steel. But when I look at her out the corner of my eye, I notice her eyes are glistening, and she\u0027s gripping the arm rest for support.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n But she sighs. We both know the land around us, the house we\u0027re drawing closer to, is all but gone. In less than two weeks, maybe a little more if we\u0027re fortunate, Gram will be homeless. I refuse to leave Nashville until she\u0027s settled somewhere else. I\u0027ll swallow my own inhibitions and go to battle for my grandmother\u0027s happiness.\\n\\n Even if the person that I\u0027m fighting is Lucas.\\n\\n Shutting off the engine, I pull the keys out of the ignition and stare out at the cabin, which really isn\u0027t a cabin at all but what can only be described as a log mansion. For the last few years, I\u0027ve told Gram that it\u0027s way too much house for her and she needs to downsize. Now . . . I feel like shit for even joking with her like that.\\n\\n \"You make yourself at home, sweetheart. I\u0027m going to go on upstairs and lie down. I\u0027ve not feeling like myself lately,\" Gram says once we\u0027re enclosed in the warmth of the house. She\u0027s hanging her coat on the rack in the foyer, so she doesn\u0027t see the way I pull at the high collar of my blouse - my grandmother keeps the house stifling hot.\\n\\n \"Room still the same?\" I ask, and as soon as the words leave my mouth, I kick myself. What an awkward, horrible thing for me to say.\\n\\n She makes an unnatural noise that\u0027s supposed to be a chuckle, but it makes me cringe. \"For the next couple weeks.\"\\n\\n \"You get some rest. I\u0027ll be fine, okay?\" But if I\u0027m so fine, why does it feel like someone\u0027s stomping up and down on my chest right now?\\n\\n While I help myself to a frozen meal in the kitchen - my grandmother is obsessed with the convenience - I call Seth. Of course he doesn\u0027t answer, so I have to leave him a message. \"Hey Seth, it\u0027s me, Sienna. I left my bags in your truck. Can you bring them by ASAP?\" And because I know he\u0027ll complain at the inconvenience of having to drive across town, I add, \"I\u0027ll give you twenty bucks for gas money.\" I re-record the message two more times until I\u0027m satisfied with how it sounds, and then I call Tori. The first ring is not even halfway through when she answers. Immediately, she starts talking rapidly.\\n\\n \"Oh my God, Sienna where\u0027ve you been? Don\u0027t you check your texts, woman? I\u0027ve been trying to get in touch with you for the last hour! You don\u0027t just send a message like that and completely disappear.\" She pauses for a moment and takes a deep breath. I can actually picture her right now, fiddling with one of the random whatnots she keeps on her desk because she\u0027s so worked up. If stress balls didn\u0027t exist, Tori would self-implode because it\u0027s absolutely necessary for her hands to stay busy. A nasally female voice says something to her, and Tori hisses back that she\u0027ll do it when Jenna, her boss, confirms the instructions.\\n\\n \"Please, please, please, tell me you\u0027re kidding me about Lucas Wolfe. Please tell me that this is a let\u0027s-screw-with-Tori-moment,\" Tori finally says in a low, breathless whisper.\\n\\n \"Nope. Not joking. Definitely him. And sorry for not calling you back sooner, I was . . . occupied.\"\\n\\n She groans, and I hear a door slam then the clacking of her high heels. When she begins to speak again, there\u0027s an echo, like she\u0027s in a stairwell. \"Sorry, had to get away from the donkey witch in the next cubicle. So . . . does he remember you? I mean, it was two years ago and you didn\u0027t actually fu - \"\\n\\n \"He remembers,\" I snap.\\n\\n She makes a noise that\u0027s a hybrid of a groan and a squeal, like she\u0027s both disgusted by the prospect and excited. \"Well, what did he say? What did he do? Holy shit, why is he in Nashville of all places? No offense, babe, but it\u0027s not exactly L.A.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m still wondering the exact same thing. I give her the explanation he gave me: \"He\u0027s here to make music. Apparently, my grandma\u0027s house is the right place for him to hole up in while he does it.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s silent for such a long time that I have to pull the phone from my ear to make sure the call hasn\u0027t dropped. It hasn\u0027t. The moment of Tori inserting dramatic silence gives me time to load my chicken pot pie and a Coke on a breakfast tray. I start upstairs, toward the bedroom I slept in as a kid, before Tori says at last, \"And that\u0027s it?\"\\n\\n I pause at the top of the steps, supporting my weight against the bannister. There\u0027s a major part of me just dying to confide in her about how Lucas had made me feel in that cafe, but the other part warns me not to touch that subject at all. Hadn\u0027t Tori been the person I bawled to after the disastrous night with Lucas. Not to mention when I found out Your Toxic Sequel never wanted me on the set of any of their music videos again and thought my career was ruined.\\n\\n If I told her I still felt the slightest bit of attraction towards Lucas she\u0027d be in Nashville on the first available flight to slap some sense into me.\\n\\n \"Well, I did tell him to go fuck himself,\" I say. It\u0027s somewhat true, even if it had been uttered after Lucas had deliberately frustrated me.\\n\\n She claps her hands slowly. \"Bad ass, Jensen. See, that wasn\u0027t so hard, was it?\"\\n\\n Ugh, she has no idea.\\n\\n \"Look, I better run, but I\u0027m proud of you, Si, for not letting Lucas run all over you and telling him off. I\u0027ll text or call you tonight.\"\\n\\n But I feel like crap when I hang up the phone and walk into my bedroom, closing the door quietly behind so I won\u0027t wake Gram. With my appetite suddenly a thing of the past, I leave the tray sitting on my dresser.\\n\\n It\u0027s comforting to see that Gram\u0027s left my room the same as it was in high school and college. The same furnishings, same pink and orange hibiscus bed spreads and Have-A-Day posters.\\n\\n I curl up in the fetal position on my old bed, burying my face in pillows that smell like fabric softener, and listen to the bitter sound of nothingness in a house that I\u0027ll miss as much as my grandmother. Silent prayers roll through my mind for the next couple weeks to be easy. And more than anything, I hope today is my very last encounter with Lucas Wolfe because I never want to feel that dull ache in my chest again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-2.html","bookId":1869,"book":{"id":1869,"title":"Devoured (Devoured #1)","description":"Storyline: Devoured (Devoured #1) \\n Sienna\u0027s dreams lie in California, but when she discovers her grandmother\u0027s Nashville home has been foreclosed, she has no other choice but to move back to Music City, where she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she\u0027d see again - and who now holds the deed to her grandma\u0027s estate.
