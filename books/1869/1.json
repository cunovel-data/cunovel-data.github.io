{"id":82622,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\"Your baby brother called. Three times.\"\n My gaze snaps up from the mail I\u0027m holding in my hands to meet Tori\u0027s dark eyes. She\u0027s ten feet away me, sitting behind the Formica countertops in the kitchen. My cool, confident roommate - who I met four years ago when she rescued me from a wasted frat boy - fidgets anxiously with the rim of a supersized shot glass that boasts some raunchy slogan. She knows my brother well enough to realize something is going on. It must be important because Seth wouldn\u0027t stop avoiding me for anything else. He\u0027s owed me two grand since July, six months ago, and the last time I actually spoke to him was Labor Day.\n Even when Seth had backed out of visiting me for Christmas break, he\u0027d done so via email.\n God . . . this can\u0027t be good.\n \"Did he say what he wants?\" I croak. I press my body up against the steel door behind me, the long row of deadbolts poking into my back. Crisp envelopes crumble between my fingertips, but I\u0027m powerless to stop myself from obliterating the stack of bills and postcards from Tori\u0027s parents. I\u0027m too worried about why Seth has called me.\n Three times. \n Tori shrugs her bare, shimmery shoulders, squints down at the splash of clear liquid in her glass, and then downs the shot in one swift flick of her wrist. There\u0027s no bottle in sight, but I know she\u0027s drinking peppermint schnapps. Her telltale bottle of a chaser (chocolate syrup) sits next to her phone. Plus, schnapps is her usual Friday night pre-gamer. Sometimes - when my boss has an off week that inevitably rubs off on me - I let Tori talk me into drinking a little. I\u0027m in no mood to even consider touching the stuff right now, though.\n There\u0027s already a migraine building in that frustrating spot between my eyes.\n \"He just said call him . . .\" she says. But as her voice trails off, I know she\u0027s thinking the same thing I am.\n What the hell has my mom done this time?\n Because last time I received a frantic call from Seth, a year and a half ago, Mom had made a suicide attempt which she later told me she fabricated for attention. I ball my hands into fist, vividly recalling how she laughed at me for being naive and stupid enough to come running.\n \"Always so quick to please,\" she\u0027d said in her thick accent. Then she took a long drag of a cigarette that she probably had to do unmentionable things for.\n Forcing thoughts of my mother out of my mind for the time being, I give Tori a fake smile. \"You going out tonight?\"\n The answer is obvious. It is Friday night, and even though only her upper body is visible, I can tell she\u0027s dressed to kill. Immaculate hair and make-up, check. Strapless red dress that\u0027s probably no longer than my top, check. Her mile high, \"screw-me\" shoes, double check.\n \"Vanguard with Ben, Stacy, and Micah.\" Her jet black, perfectly arched eyebrows knit together as she parts her lips to say something else. I shake my head stubbornly, and she snaps her mouth shut. We both know that her inviting me is pointless. Tonight, no amount of sweet-talking will convince me to leave the apartment. There\u0027s a good chance that whatever Seth is about to tell me will ruin my night and the rest of my year, too.\n I swallow hard, over and over again, in my best attempt to get rid of the burn in the back of my mouth.\n \"That\u0027s it,\" Tori snaps. She reaches across the counter to grab her phone. \"I\u0027m calling to cance - \" But I lunge forward and pluck the cellphone out of her hand. I drop the balled-up - and now practically fused together - pile of mail beside her empty glass.\n \"Please, just . . . don\u0027t. You look way too hot to spend your night with me. I-I swear I\u0027ll be fine.\" She doesn\u0027t seem convinced because she purses her full lips into a thin, scarlet line. I slide her phone into her hands and curl her fingers around it. I move my face into an even brighter smile and tell her in the most chipper voice I can muster to have a good time.\n She\u0027s talking, protesting me, but I can barely hear her exact words. I\u0027m already walking down the narrow hallway to my bedroom, my own phone clutched in a death grip.\n Seth picks up on the second ring, as I\u0027m shutting my bedroom door behind myself. On those rare occasions that we speak, he always lets my call go to voicemail and then responds to me five or six hours later.\n This is definitely not good.\n \"Thank God,\" he hisses before I can get a syllable out. \"Where\u0027ve you been, Si? And why the hell didn\u0027t I have this number?\"\n Less than ten seconds into our conversation and Seth\u0027s arguing with me. I slam my oversized bag onto my bed. My wallet along with a bunch of tampons and makeup spill out onto the lavender cotton sheets and some fall on the carpeted floor. I\u0027ll clean it up later. \"I work. And I\u0027ve tried to call you from this number several times. You just didn\u0027t answer.\" I don\u0027t sound angry, which is how I feel, but like I\u0027m explaining myself to my brother. Like I\u0027m the one who should be sorry for him ignoring me.\n I hate myself for sounding like that.\n \"Sienna, it\u0027s Gran,\" he says.\n And this - this is when I literally freeze in place, standing between my bed and desk. I must look like one of those tragic, serious statues in the cemeteries back home. My heart feels as if it\u0027s stopped. The first thing I\u0027d assumed when Tori told me Seth was trying to reach me was that my mom had somehow gotten herself in trouble again. I hadn\u0027t even thought of my grandmother because she\u0027s so strong and resilient and wonderful.\n She\u0027s also 79 years old.\n I try to say something, anything, but there\u0027s a lump the size of a lint-flavored golf ball clogging the back of my throat. I\u0027m choking and wheezing when Seth finally exhales an exasperated sigh and snaps, \"She\u0027s fine, Si. Well, physically fine.\"\n Then, he tells me what\u0027s going on. He says words like foreclosure and eviction notice. New owner - some douchebag musician from California. Court on Monday. And then he tells me that I need to be there for her, for him.\n \"I have to work,\" I whisper. I can\u0027t imagine what Tomas will say if I ask for time off for anything besides a funeral or the certain impending demise of an immediate family member. He might fire me. Or worse, he might give me a horrible reference and I\u0027ll never get another wardrobe job for the rest of my life.\n \"No, you\u0027ve got to be here.\"\n \"Seth, I can\u0027t just . . .\" But I\u0027m already sitting in front of my laptop with my online bank statement pulled up on one tab and a discount ticket website on another. I\u0027m already entering in my debit card information for an early Monday morning flight, biting down so hard on my lower lip I taste blood. I\u0027m broke. Half of what\u0027s in my account - half of my total savings - will have to go to Tori for my share of the bills.\n And before I hang up with my little brother, I\u0027m already shoving my belongings inside of the beaten Coach suitcase my grandparents gave me five years ago as an eighteenth birthday present.\n It\u0027s mind-numbingly cold in Nashville - 33 degrees to be precise - and snowing lightly when I scoot into Seth\u0027s messy Dodge pick-up truck on Monday afternoon. From the way I\u0027m sweating, though, you would think it were the middle of August and that I\u0027d arrived in Nashville dressed in head to toe wool. The flutter sleeve top I so carefully selected because it makes me look professional clings to my skin and the tops of my thigh high tights sag to just above my knees.\n The sudden spike in perspiration is my own fault - I spent the entire four hour flight from California fretting over how I\u0027d convince Gram to come back to L.A. with me. And the more I thought about it, the more doubtful I became. My granddad had built her that cabin and land as a gift after my mother was born in the early seventies. There\u0027s no way in hell Gram\u0027s giving it up without a fight, even though from what Seth has said, the house is already gone.\n \"What\u0027d your boss say?\" my brother asks as he turns onto the interstate. He slams on the brakes to avoid hitting another car. The Dodge skids on the slippery road, jostling us around, but Seth manages to get the truck under control halfway into my frantic gasp.\n Seth doesn\u0027t so much as flinch. He squints straight ahead, the same way our dad does when he drives in crappy weather, and rubs the tips of his thumbs on either side of the steering wheel - another Dad trait. With his dark blonde hair, brown eyes, and year-round tan that puts my easily-burnt skin to shame, Seth even looks like Dad now.\n \"You going to answer me or just sit there with your mouth wide open?\"\n Digging my hands into the hem of the dark tweed pencil skirt I\u0027m wearing, I shrug. \"I worked through Christmas and New Year, so he didn\u0027t have much of a problem. Besides, I\u0027m just an assistant.\" I don\u0027t add that I had to beg Tomas for the time off and that he\u0027d pointedly said I better take care of my family drama and have my ass back in L.A. before the end of the month - two and a half weeks.\n \"Echo Falls is ranked first in females aged 18 to 34. There are people willing to trade their own offspring for a chance to work on this series. That being said, replacing you with a new wardrobe person who covets his career won\u0027t be too hard a feat,\" Tomas had said, punching something into the iPad he carried around everywhere. He never even spared me a glance so when he shoved a newly inventoried wardrobe rack against a brick slab wall, he didn\u0027t see me startle. \"Don\u0027t force me to find that person, Jensen.\"\n \"I\u0027ll wrap it up in two weeks, Tomas,\" I\u0027d promised.\n \"You better.\"\n Telling Seth any of that is simply a waste of oxygen. He would either not get why I can\u0027t neglect my job whenever I please or simply not care. Knowing my brother, it would be the second.\n \"Got anything I can wipe my face with?\" I ask. Thinking about my job has me sweating even worse than before.\n \"Center console.\"\n I find a package of wet wipes in between a half-empty 30-count box of condoms and a completely empty bottle of Jose Cuervo. Before I can stop myself, I whirl on him and blurt, \"I hope you\u0027re not stupid enough to drink and drive. You\u0027re only nineteen and you - \"\n \"Don\u0027t start, Si, okay? Today isn\u0027t a good day for your bitching. \"\n Sinking my teeth down on the inside of my jaw, I turn my attention to the bumper stickers on the tiny little Escort in front of us. Honk If You Hate People Too. How fitting.\n It\u0027s only an eight mile drive from the airport to the courthouse, but the trip ends up taking forty-five minutes thanks to the traffic and the snow. Seth and I spend nearly every minute of it in silence - just as we usually do when we\u0027re around each other. As I dab at my face with wipes and smooth my long, red hair back into a low ponytail, I mentally kick myself for being dumbass enough to lend him money. He\u0027s not mentioned it, and I doubt he will. Seth\u0027s smart enough to realize that I\u0027ll never bring up the money he owes me because I\u0027d rather gouge myself in the eye than get into a confrontation with him.\n There\u0027s a reason why I rarely come to town and baby brother is just the smallest part of it.\n By time Seth and I arrive at the courthouse and find the correct courtroom, the hearing is coming to an end. We sit on opposite ends of one of the wooden benches at the back of the room - him with his arms crossed tightly over his chest and me leaning forward, listening attentively.\n From what I manage to piece together, this is the second hearing. The new purchaser, whom I\u0027ve decided to refer to as Asshat and his lawyers are both here, and they\u0027re seeking a formal eviction. My grandmother and her attorney Mr. Nielson (the same one she\u0027s had since before I can remember) are across from them on the left side of the room. I find myself glaring death rays at Asshat\u0027s back, even though I know I shouldn\u0027t really be angry at him.\n Just like I shouldn\u0027t be checking him out.\n His back is turned to me, so there\u0027s a depressing limit to what I\u0027m able to ogle, but I know that he\u0027s built. And with a backside like his, the rest of him is bound to be just as gorgeous. Dressed in an impeccable black business suit that molds a little too perfectly to every inch of his body, he\u0027s got dark, tousled hair that brushes his neck and long fingers. He taps them rapidly in some type of rhythm on the mahogany table that\u0027s in front of him. I\u0027m tall, but this guy towers over me by a good six inches - he\u0027s easily 6\u00273\" or 6\u00274\". And his ass . . . ugh, I bet the last thousand dollars in my account (and would even overdraw it a few hundred bucks) that the attorney beside him would be staring at it too if she could get away with it. Or if she could stop beaming up at him with her chest poked out for longer than five seconds.\n Hot-faced and utterly reluctant, I drag my gaze back to Gram\u0027s side of the courtroom. If Seth catches me staring at Asshat, he\u0027ll never let me live it down. Knowing him, he\u0027ll probably accuse me of conspiring with the enemy.\n I frown, because I know that\u0027s exactly what Seth would say.\n \"Mr. Nielson, your client has ten days before the court issues a possession order,\" the judge is telling my grandmother\u0027s lawyer. \"After that, the sheriff will carry out the eviction within a week.\" When my grandmother\u0027s shoulders sag and she grips Nielson\u0027s shoulder for support so hard her knuckles turn white, it takes every ounce of my willpower not to bolt out of my seat. I hate this. I hate my mother for this, because at the heart of things, it really is all her fault.\n I was right when I assumed she\u0027d done something stupid. Mom\u0027s the reason my grandmother is losing her home.\n And then, the hearing is over. Gram\u0027s bright blue eyes widen in stunned surprise as she makes her way to the back of the room toward me and Seth, but then her face softens. She gives me a sad smile that\u0027s full of defeat. I\u0027ve only seen her look at me like this once before. There\u0027s a sour taste in my mouth when I realize it was in this exact courthouse. Before Gram has a chance to utter a single word, I pull her to me and bury my face into her puff of gray hair, inhaling the familiar scent of vanilla.\n \"Did you drive?\" I ask. She nods into my shoulder, so I say, \"I\u0027ll take you back home then.\" I loosen my grip around her, glaring over my shoulder at Asshat. Now, his back is no longer turned to me. Instead, I have a side view that\u0027s just as nauseatingly sexy as the back.\n He\u0027s speaking to his female attorney, and they\u0027re both laughing. She\u0027s got her hand on his arm and her boobs are still jutted out. If we were anywhere else I\u0027d discreetly snort aloud at how ridiculous she looks. He\u0027s probably thanking her. And she\u0027s more than likely suggesting they celebrate the easy win against an old woman and her equally ancient lawyer over drinks and then a quick screw at her place. I\u0027m about to draw away from Gram and leave the courtroom when the man turns his face, lifts his eyes. Our gazes connect. Hazel and blue.\n Predator and prey.\n He squints at me.\n My chest seizes up. I was right, the full package is devastatingly handsome. And when I decided to nickname him \"Asshat,\" I was being much too lenient.\n I pray my grandmother doesn\u0027t feel the change in my heartbeat, the sudden hitch in the way that I\u0027m breathing. This exchange between Asshat and me isn\u0027t one of those love-at-first site moments - no, it\u0027s nothing like that. This is one of those moments where fate has roundhouse kicked me in the face yet again. Why is he here in Nashville? In the same courtroom as me?\n God, please don\u0027t let him remember me.\n For a moment, I\u0027m sure he has no clue who I am, that he\u0027ll go back to chatting it up with Boobs McBeal. By now there would\u0027ve been tens, hundreds, of other girls. I\u0027m nothing to him. I\u0027m the weirdo, I tell myself.\n But then, a slow, animalistic smile of realization stretches across Lucas Wolfe\u0027s face.\n It makes me feel like he\u0027ll devour me whole at any second.\n It\u0027s also the exact same grin he gave me two years ago, right after I refused to let him cuff me to his bed, and just before he literally told me to get the fuck out of his house. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-1.html","bookId":1869,"book":{"id":1869,"title":"Devoured (Devoured #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Devoured (Devoured #1) \n Sienna\u0027s dreams lie in California, but when she discovers her grandmother\u0027s Nashville home has been foreclosed, she has no other choice but to move back to Music City, where she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she\u0027d see again - and who now holds the deed to her grandma\u0027s estate.
