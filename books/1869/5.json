{"id":82626,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"As soon as the sense of feeling reenters my lower body, I bolt up out of the booth. Since I\u0027m so tall, my knees bump hard alongside the table. Wincing in pain and bowing over in humiliation, my vision pings back and forth between Lucas and his sister. In order for me to be successful in my escape, one of them is going to have to move out of the way. Kylie\u0027s face is still downturned. She\u0027s not able to see the glare I\u0027m casting her way, but Lucas - He\u0027s standing a mere foot away, looking directly at me as he blocks my path out of the booth. He\u0027s calm and gorgeous, amused and completely animal. Right now, he embodies everything I want and everything I fear. I will be so much safer if I forget ever wanting him, and once I arrive home, this whole night in general. \"Please take me home,\" I say to Kylie, accentuating every word. I\u0027m livid that she tricked me into coming out just so Lucas could have dinner with me, just so he could more than likely try to convince me to go to bed with him afterward. But most importantly, I\u0027m furious at myself for falling for it and being optimistic enough to hope that she really did have a solution to saving the house. I feel like a complete fool. \"Kylie, please?\" I whisper. The few people sitting in the tables around us have pretty much given up on their meals and conversations. Now, they\u0027re leaning in toward us hoping to get a glimpse of what\u0027s going on. A lover\u0027s quarrel, perhaps? Or a man who\u0027s come to convince his girlfriend to come home because he thinks she\u0027s spent too much time with her girlfriend? I try to tell myself I don\u0027t care what those people think of the situation because I\u0027ll never see them again, but I only succeed in making myself more ashamed. I notice how flushed my hands are when I wring them together, wishing it was Lucas\u0027s neck between them instead. Ugh, not very likely that will ever happen. I have better luck getting my wish that the floor will open up and swallow me whole. \"Sit down, Sienna,\" Lucas orders me in a low tone. Shaking my head stubbornly, I drag in a deep inhale through my nose. I grip the leather back of the booth in one hand and the edge of the table in the other. \"Please move so I can leave.\" He bends his head down to mine, so near to me that I can feel his breath fanning my ear and smell spearmint from the gum he must have been chewing earlier. \"For once, do as you\u0027re told before you shoot yourself in the foot.\" I gawk at Kylie, who\u0027s as flushed as I am and staring down at her phone. Maybe she feels awful for luring me here. Probably not, though. If she\u0027s anything like her brother, she\u0027s more concerned about the scene we\u0027re making and the people who are pretending not to watch us than about hurting my pride. I shouldn\u0027t have fallen for her act with Gram either, but then again, I\u0027ve never been the best judge of character. Quietly, I lower myself until I\u0027m sitting, staring daggers at Lucas all the while. He croons something in a pleased voice that sounds dangerously like \"that\u0027s my girl\", and then slides in next to me. The further I slip into the curved booth, the closer he comes. Finally, I just stop moving because there\u0027s no use trying to put any more space between the two of us. I\u0027m unreasonably close to being right on top of Kylie. I move an inch or two in his direction and he calls me a good girl. Lucas has got me right where he wants me, with the length of his body hot and hard and extremely noticeable against my side. If I just listen to what he has to say then I\u0027ll be able to leave and forget this night ever happened. Yeah . . . right after he fucks with my head a little. Right after he tries to convince me to screw him. My skin prickles all over. \"You\u0027ll be across the street?\" Lucas questions Kylie. When she says she will, my mouth falls open and I look up to protest. Even though she sold me out, I don\u0027t want her to leave. She\u0027s the one who got me into this mess to begin with so what gives her the right to skip out? \"You can\u0027t go,\" I say, my voice deep. But she gives me a guilty, almost sad, smile. \"Sorry, Sienna, but this one\u0027s between the two of you. I\u0027ll be the one to take you home, though.\" She reaches out her fingers to give my hand an encouraging pat but I knock them away. The sharp edge of one of the bronze skull rings she\u0027s wearing nicks the tip of my thumb and I press it between my teeth. \"Thanks.\" I say to Kylie, the word muffled. Not that it matters because I don\u0027t mean it. Lucas clears his throat, and she ducks her head, shimmying out of the booth. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" she murmurs. She glances back once, before she disappears from sight, but I pretend not to see her. I know it\u0027s childish but being an adult has gotten me nowhere in this situation. \"God, you look like sin,\" Lucas says as I pull my thumb from my mouth. The edge in his voice sends a cold thrill racing through me, from the toes of my black pumps, to the top of my head, where I\u0027d styled my long red hair into a messy up-do. My eyes flutter shut and silently, I countdown from 20. It won\u0027t take much to walk away. No, it won\u0027t take anything. I can call a cab, or God forbid, Seth. I shouldn\u0027t stay here with Lucas because he\u0027s about as bad for my mental health as I am for his music. 17, 16, 15 . . . But if I just leave without hearing him out, I\u0027ll seem weak. He\u0027ll know I can\u0027t take being around him. He\u0027ll figure out how big that part of me that can\u0027t resist him really is. And I want to think that he can\u0027t use that against me, but he can. Lucas is the type who will exploit any weakness to get what he wants. 7, 6, 5 . . . No, I won\u0027t leave. Not until I find out - His fingertips tangle into my hair, sending hairpins flying to the tabletop and onto the seat in a quick, gentle motion. My red hair spills into my face, around my shoulders, and both of us suck in our breaths at the same time. \"Your fucking hair . . .\" \"What do want from me?\" I ask \"Everything,\" he whispers, turning his head so that his lips touch my temple. He inhales the scent of me in before speaking again. When he does, he almost sounds intoxicated. \"But for now . . . I want you to work for me.\" He draws back and puts a - dare I say - professional amount of room between us. I\u0027m stunned to realize that the cheese and vegetables have been cleared away and now there\u0027s a salad sitting in front of us. I was so wrapped up in the moment with Lucas that I hadn\u0027t noticed the server\u0027s return. Damn Lucas for driving me to distraction over and over and over again. And fuck myself for letting him. Why do I do this to myself? Lucas spears a fork into his salad and takes a bite. I study the way he chews - slow, deliberate movements. Tiny flicks of his tongue that causes my body to burn. He turns eating, something that is so basic, into a seductive art. I catch myself sinking my teeth into my own lip as I imagine him drawing it in between his teeth. \"I\u0027m offering you Ms. Previn\u0027s home in exchange for your . . . services. Ten days. My rules. And you have to cater to my every need. Then, I\u0027ll personally sign over the deed to your grandmother\u0027s home.\" I let his words sink into my brain sluggishly, like spoiled molasses. Let the shame wash over me. \"I\u0027m not like that,\" I whisper, turning my face away from him so he doesn\u0027t see the tears threatening to spill down my cheeks and ruin the makeup I so carefully applied. He catches my chin between his thumb and forefinger, forcing me to look at him. To face him. He gives me a sarcastic, pouty expression and I clench my fingers into the fabric of my dress so I don\u0027t try to smack it right off. \"I never said you were. Just took you for the type who likes to work for the things she wants.\" What he\u0027s just said - it takes everything cruel comment Preston ever made to me when we were dating, adds them together, and multiplies them. \"I\u0027m not going to fuck you for money, Lucas.\" He doesn\u0027t try to stop me as I stiffly maneuver my way out of the booth. I\u0027m three steps away from the table, and struggling with the bitter urge to just break down bawling, when he says, \"There\u0027s no fucking involved.\" His voice is so soft and cold, it makes me shiver, like a gust of wind has just swept through the room. Warily, I take a peek over my right shoulder. He\u0027s pushed his salad away, and has his arm draped over the back of the booth, expecting me to sit back down. But what\u0027s surprising is his face. The sardonic look is gone, and is replaced by one that\u0027s apologetic - a look that\u0027s earnest. \"What?\" \"Sit and we\u0027ll talk.\" Another order, but he has my attention. He knows there\u0027s no way in hell I\u0027m exiting this restaurant without finishing this conversation now. Quietly, I climb into the booth, sitting in a way that we\u0027re facing each other. I can feel his eyes blistering into me as I play with my fork, twirling it between my fingers while I wait for him to explain himself. He lets me sweat for a couple minutes - allows me to think of so many scenarios that I\u0027m squirming in my seat. I tap the toe of my shoes on the hard floor, beating out a staccato rhythm. He takes a breath and then, at last, he speaks. \"Kylie\u0027s going on vacation to New Orleans and I need a personal assistant while she\u0027s away.\" \"A personal assistant,\" I repeat, and he bows his head, smiling at me so politely I\u0027m sure it hurts his face. Polite on Lucas Wolfe is about the same as aggressive on me - outright awkward. \"Mmmhmm, and naturally I want someone I already know. You.\" Me - the same wardrobe girl who was banned from ever working on the set of a Your Toxic Sequel anything ever again. The same girl who\u0027d shot him down after he tried to convince her to be bound to his bed. The same girl he still wants to bind. \"You want me to work for you because you just want to have sex with me,\" I snarl. Blowing out a noisy breath, I continue, \"You can call me a personal assistant all you want, but this is because of sex. So why not just ask me to screw you?\" He smiles that unsettling smile that makes me question my sanity for still being near him. The same smile that also makes me wonder why I\u0027m not throwing my body into his arms right this instant. Because of what he\u0027ll do to you, that little voice in the back of my head warns me. He\u0027ll take everything and won\u0027t give a damn thing in return. \"I told you already,\" he says. \"This is work of the non-sexual variety.\" \"And where does my grandma\u0027s house come into play?\" \"Isn\u0027t it obvious? It\u0027ll be your paycheck. You play my game for ten days, I give you the house.\" The sip of water I\u0027m swallowing goes down the wrong way, and I choke on it, clutching at my chest. He moves closer, his face wrinkled with concern. Gasping, I manage to assure him that I\u0027m fine. Then I squeeze the bridge of my burning nose as I try to give his words a chance to fully register. He wants me to work for him. In exchange for Gram\u0027s house. Ho-ly fuck. \"Are you smoking crack?\" I demand, in a rough voice I\u0027ve never even heard myself use before. His eyebrows arch, and the corners of his lips quirk up. \"That\u0027s not even - is that even plausible? That would have to be the most idiotic business decision ever.\" Chuckling, he places his elbows on the table and links his fingers together so that he can lean his chin against his hands. The sleeves of his gray and black Henley roll up just slightly and I find my eyes drawn to the tattoo on his left wrist, an ornate skeleton key surrounded by barbs. \"It\u0027s just a house,\" he says. I hope he doesn\u0027t see the way I flinch just slightly. But inside, I feel like he\u0027s reeled back and slapped me across my face with every ounce of force he\u0027s capable of. What\u0027s merely a house for him is something else entirely to my grandmother, to me and Seth. \"It\u0027s just money,\" he adds, with a nonchalant shrug of his broad shoulders. His unruly hair brushes his neck. \"A lot of it,\" I hiss. \"It\u0027s a lot of money.\" \"And I have a lot more of it. I\u0027ve blown what I spent on your grandmother\u0027s house on parties and strippers and booze in a month.\" For some reason, I\u0027m not at all surprised if not more than a little disgusted. Shaking the thought of him raining enough money to buy a home on a spray-tanned pole dancer named Candi, I say in an even tone, \"But what do you have to gain by this? If you don\u0027t want me to have sex with you, why make this kind of offer?\" \"Do you know what I realized about you?\" he asks, seemingly changing the subject. When I don\u0027t answer, he keeps talking, \"You are infuriatingly submissive to everyone around you . . . except me.\" And it hits me. Why he kicked me out of his house two years ago. Why he wants me right now. I am a challenge. \"You want me to submit to you,\" I whisper, and I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m disgusted or turned on. \"I want you to do it willingly, yes,\" he says. \"And if I say no?\" \"Then you finish your dinner, and leave, no strings attached.\" \"Except I won\u0027t get the house.\" He ignores my statement, offering the servers who bring our next course - shrimp and steak - a crowd-winning smile. From the way they\u0027re looking at him, they\u0027ve got to know who he is and that he\u0027s using this restaurant as a setting for shady business deals. By the way they keep their eyes down and say very little, I don\u0027t think they\u0027re about to put up a complaint about what he\u0027s doing. He\u0027s probably paid them well for minimal interruption and autographed napkins for them. I push my food around the plate with my fork. I\u0027ve lost my appetite and all I want to do is finish this so I can go home and take a shower. Yet, I hear myself ask, \"You won\u0027t make me have sex with you?\" God, why am I even questioning him? I should be running away, not continuing the conversation. Everything about this conversation just screams escort. Lucas\u0027s lips curl in a sneer. \"I don\u0027t have to pay girls to sleep with me, Sienna, and I\u0027m not going to start with you. I just want you with me, for ten days, answering to my every need. My band\u0027s coming so we can record the last couple songs for the new album. I\u0027m doing a documentary with a film crew. Going to a birthday party where I\u0027ll perform in Atlanta for a very close friend. I need someone to keep me organized.\" \"And that person is me because you want to make me your little - \" He leans forward, pressing one finger over my mouth. Instinct kicks in and I try to lick my lips, grazing his flesh instead. \"Assistant,\" he says. \"And yes, it is you. It\u0027s always been you. You do this for me, I hand you the deed to the house and your grandmother doesn\u0027t get evicted. I\u0027ll go back to California and everyone will be happy.\" \"And no making me do sexual favors?\" I ask one final time. His lips curl up into a hungry smile and I know there\u0027s a caveat. \"Oh, we\u0027ll fuck Sienna. Believe me, it\u0027s been bound to happen since I first laid eyes on you. But this time it\u0027s going to be because you beg me. Not the other way around. And when you do beg me, it\u0027s because you\u0027re consensual and ready to completely give yourself to me.\" Squaring my shoulders, I sit back stiffly on my side of the booth, glaring down at my plate full of food. \"I see.\" He slides a folded square of paper across the table. I open it to reveal his name, a phone number, and a time written in precise handwriting. 9:00 pm. \"The offer\u0027s on the table until tomorrow night.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-5.html","bookId":1869,"book":{"id":1869,"title":"Devoured (Devoured #1)","description":"Storyline: Devoured (Devoured #1) Sienna\u0027s dreams lie in California, but when she discovers her grandmother\u0027s Nashville home has been foreclosed, she has no other choice but to move back to Music City, where she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she\u0027d see again - and who now holds the deed to her grandma\u0027s estate.
