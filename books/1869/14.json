{"id":82635,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The creator of the documentary doesn\u0027t try to ask me any additional questions, and I\u0027m sure he thinks I\u0027m a massive bitch now. Still, I make it a point to stay away from him. I can feel his eyes burning into the side of my face, though, as if he\u0027s just dying to confirm whether or not something is actually going on between Lucas and me. As if he knows that the reason why I do my best not to meet Lucas\u0027s eyes is because my mind goes to places it shouldn\u0027t go in public.\\n\\n Or in private.\\n\\n The band performs four takes before they nail the song. Then Wyatt disappears, directing a dangerous look at Sinjin and swearing he\u0027ll rip the walls down if he doesn\u0027t get a break. I take this opportunity to check my personal cell phone. There\u0027s a missed call from Seth and one from Gram. Even though I called her earlier, fear slices through my body. Does she know where I am? Has Seth told her what was on the Internet yesterday morning?\\n\\n Numb, I excuse myself from the control room yet again and call my voicemail as I pace the hallways. Seth\u0027s message is short, and surprisingly, sort of sweet. \"You can\u0027t ignore me forever, Si. I was wrong. I\u0027m a shithead. Let\u0027s talk, okay? You and Gram are all I\u0027ve got so call me back.\"\\n\\n I listen to my grandmother\u0027s message next - she\u0027s just returning my call and wants me to dial her back when my work isn\u0027t so crazy. \"And I\u0027m so happy you\u0027re coming home soon,\" she says before ending the message. She doesn\u0027t say anything about Lucas or the videos or pictures of us that ended up online and I feel a weight lift off my shoulders.\\n\\n For now.\\n\\n I start to return Seth\u0027s call but then decide against it. When I call Seth, I want to have plenty of time to get some things off my chest, and I don\u0027t want to do it in a studio where pieces of my conversation may end up in some documentary about rock bands. I pass by the private room that Lucas and I were in earlier, pausing when I hear the sounds of someone moaning on the other side. I move forward, but a hand closes around my upper arm.\\n\\n Startled, I jump and spin around to face Sinjin. He holds up his hands, wiggling them around as if to show me he\u0027s not armed. Then he grins. \"Spying is rude,\" he tells me. \"Though if you want to join Wyatt and the little blonde with the tits, I\u0027m sure he\u0027d let you, red hair or not.\"\\n\\n Size Nothing and Wyatt. I don\u0027t want to be surprised but I am, especially after the way she eyed Lucas earlier. \"I\u0027m good, thanks,\" I say, starting to walk off. Sinjin plunks his hand on the smooth wall next to my face, stopping me. Feeling my muscles tighten, I shove it away and continue towards the exit. He follows.\\n\\n \"You look really familiar, you know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you meet a lot of girls doing what you do, even redheads.\" If my grandmother could hear the coolness in my voice right now, she\u0027d pop me in the mouth for being so rude. I can\u0027t help it. There\u0027s something about Sinjin that rubs me the wrong way, but then again, it always has.\\n\\n When I worked the \"All Over You\" video, I had tried my hardest to stay as far away from him as much as professionally possible, but of course he\u0027d been unavoidable. If Lucas had fallen head over heels in kinky lust with my submissive tendencies it was because of Sinjin. Back then, he had freaked me out and even now I just want to shake him off of me.\\n\\n I push open the exit doors, breathing in fresh air. Sinjin is right on my heels. \"No, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what it is at all. Did we fuck? Or did you fuck one of the others before you started up with Lucas? I mean, I know I don\u0027t remember you from him because he doesn\u0027t hold on to \u0027em for very long, if you know what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"Actually I don\u0027t,\" I say. Now, my voice is hard. \"I was under the impression that he\u0027s had the same personal assistant for years.\"\\n\\n Sinjin\u0027s nose wrinkles and he shakes his head in pity. \"Is that what he says you are - his personal assistant? Whatever keeps your mouth around his dick, right?\"\\n\\n He\u0027s just trying to get a response out of me, but God, he sure is going for a big one. When I say nothing, crossing my arms over my chest, he begins to laugh. Loud, boisterous laughter that makes a woman in the next parking lot glance over at us with her eyebrow lifted.\\n\\n Turning his body in her direction, he yells out, \"What are you looking at, you fat bitch?\"\\n\\n Even from several feet away I hear her gasp before she flushes a bright red, rushes into her car and speed off. What\u0027s wrong with this man? He\u0027s shaking with laughter, raking his hands through his short, blonde hair, and singing. I back up towards the door to get inside of the studio, banging on it so that the guard can let me in.\\n\\n Sinjin turns back around to face me, and there are tears streaming down his cheeks. Now, instead of laughing, he\u0027s sobbing violently. I move closer to him, finally noticing the beads of perspiration on his upper lip. He shakes his head, backs up.\\n\\n He\u0027s messed up, completely obliterated. I\u0027ve not been around drug addicts for so long that it\u0027s taken me this long to notice it.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t touch me, you slut,\" he hisses, pulling at clumps of his hair.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to help you, and - \"\\n\\n He lunges toward me, and out of reflex or watching too many movies with Tori, I ram my elbow back into his nose and bring my knee up to strike him in the stomach. He stumbles backward, glaring down at the blood on one of his hands and holding his belly tight with the other. Then he vomits all over himself.\\n\\n The door behind us buzzes open.\\n\\n Lucas orders me to go home, to the house on Green Hills, and wait for him while he handles things for Sinjin. I don\u0027t argue, despite having a million questions and even more concerns. But I find myself pulling Lucas close to me, our hands clasped and his chin on top of my head. He inhales my scent for what seems like forever before gently nudging me into the Escalade. When our eyes meet, the fear in his is enough to paralyze me.\\n\\n I\u0027m still shaken the moment after I enter the house and lock the doors and activate the alarm, but I call Seth. After seeing Sinjin fall apart and realizing how much of things similar to that Seth had seen as a kid, I know it\u0027s the perfect time to talk to my brother. Plus, Lucas is right. There\u0027s so much I need to say to my brother and until I do, I won\u0027t ever be able to do anything else.\\n\\n Seth sounds anguished from the moment he answers. \"Sienna, I\u0027m - \"\\n\\n \"No, you listen for once,\" I say. \"You can\u0027t just take out your frustrations on people you care about without even giving them a chance to explain themselves. And by the way, I don\u0027t have to explain myself to you, the same way you don\u0027t want to prove yourself to me. You ripped into me without knowing a goddamn thing about what was going on. If you had only asked me, I probably would have just told you what you wanted to know.\"\\n\\n \"Look, I - \"\\n\\n I cut him off again. \"I\u0027m not finished. If you ever talk to me like you did yesterday again, I will kick you in the balls, Seth. You\u0027re so pissed at what Mom did to you, the way Jeremy used to talk to you, the people they brought around you, and yet you act just like them.\" And here I am, the total opposite of Seth. Wincing every time someone so much as breathes at me.\\n\\n \"Seth, I don\u0027t want to be the fucked up people they\u0027ve made us,\" I whisper.\\n\\n He inhales and exhales heavily for what seems like minutes, hours, but in reality is only seconds. \"Me neither.\"\\n\\n \"So what do we do?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"God, I wish I could tell you. But I\u0027m sorry, Sienna. I shouldn\u0027t have ever spoken to you like that. I-I love you.\"\\n\\n \"Holy shit, are we having a creepy talking card moment?\" I ask, and he laughs.\\n\\n When he finally stops, his tone of voice turns serious. \"Can you tell me what you\u0027re doing with Wolfe? Please?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s best I don\u0027t,\" I say honestly.\\n\\n \"Well then, let me ask you this: Does it have something to do with the house?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n And no. It started out as having everything to do with the house and now . . . I\u0027m not entirely positive what it is anymore. The only thing I do know is that no matter how happy I pretend I am in five days, I\u0027ll be dying inside because I\u0027ll have to let this go.\\n\\n I\u0027ll have to let Lucas go.\\n\\n I\u0027m sure my brother\u0027s mind has gone to the worst possible assumptions but after he clears his throat a couple times, he says, \"Then I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve got a good ass reason for what you\u0027re doing.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s the closest thing to an acceptance that I\u0027m probably going to get from my brother, but for now it works. I have a feeling that in order for Seth and me to really get all of our feelings out on the table, we\u0027re going to have to do it in front of our mother.\\n\\n And when that happens, we\u0027ll go ahead and take Gram along for the ride too. That way Mom can finally explain to us why she convinced Gram to take out a six-figure loan on her house to bail her out of jail just to turn around and skip town.\\n\\n It will be a good old family reunion, complete with tears and hatred.\\n\\n Lucas comes in while I\u0027m answering his fan mail, looking absolutely exhausted. I feel awkward asking him anything about Sinjin, so I don\u0027t keep him in the little downstairs office for long. An hour after he arrives, though, he messages me to come upstairs to the main office.\\n\\n I\u0027m at a genuine loss for words as I linger by the door, my fingers gripping the elaborate crown molding as I wait for him to say something, anything at all.\\n\\n He stands, coming around to the front of the desk and motions me forward. I go to him but leave a foot of space between ourselves. \"Sin\u0027s agreed to go back to rehab,\" he says.\\n\\n I can still see the wild look in Sinjin\u0027s eyes when he came after me. Honestly, I don\u0027t think he was sober enough to hit his mark, but it was still terrifying to think about him being high enough to try and hurt me. \"I\u0027m so glad. D-do you think . . . he\u0027ll be alright?\" I whisper.\\n\\n Leaning his tall body to the desk, Lucas shrugs, frustrated. \"He\u0027s been before. Every time we gear up for a tour or an album. And it\u0027s prescription now, so who the fuck knows.\"\\n\\n My chest clenches painfully, and I bring my hands up to my mouth. \"God, Lucas. Ugh, I\u0027m so very sorry,\" I say. And this is why I hate drugs and the people who dole them out like Skittles. They tear families into a million pieces, and Sinjin is like a brother to Lucas. They\u0027ve been making music together for ten years, since they were eighteen, and were friends long before that.\\n\\n I don\u0027t want this to be the end of their relationship.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m the one who should be sorry, Sienna. For whatever he said to you. For putting you in such a fucked up situation to begin with - Kylie warned me he was back on the pills but I didn\u0027t want to listen.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s your best friend,\" I point out. \"And he needs a lot of help.\"\\n\\n Tentatively, as if he\u0027s still unsure of whether or not he should still take my invitation to touch me to heart, he lifts my hands up, pressing them between his. Closing his eyes, he touches my fingers to his lips and kisses them softly. \"He is. He\u0027s my oldest friend, but I wanted to rip him to fucking shreds when I found out he was out there with you alone.\"\\n\\n \"Really, he didn\u0027t say anything that bothered me,\" I lie. \"And besides, I\u0027m us - \"\\n\\n \"If you say that you\u0027re used to people treating you like that I swear to God I\u0027ll bend you over this desk and keep my promise with the drumsticks.\"\\n\\n My breath catches, and he squeezes my hands a little harder, a little more desperately. \"I called my brother earlier,\" I whisper, dragging my hands away from his and sliding them down the front of his body.\\n\\n \"Stop,\" he warns as he grabs my wrists. His lips are inches away from my lips. I stretch my neck up to touch them but he moves his head a fraction.\\n\\n \"I told him what you told me to say. I told him - \"\\n\\n Groaning, he very gently pushes me away from him and drags his hands up and down his face. \"Unbelievable. I come in from, literally, one of the shittiest days of my life and you\u0027re being obedient and - \"\\n\\n His cock is hard. I can see its outline straining against his jeans and he\u0027s not making a move to hide it. \"Do you want me to go away, Sir?\" I murmur.\\n\\n \"Come back over here, Sienna,\" he growls. I obey, moving closer to him until I can practically feel static electricity thrumming from our bodies. \"Get down on your knees.\"\\n\\n I know where this is going to go. I know that if I do this I\u0027m only a few steps away from uttering those words he\u0027s challenged me to say since even before day one began. Nevertheless, I\u0027m at the point where I want to see this through. Where I have to have him, even if I have to come to terms with giving myself over in the process\\n\\n Where I know that the chemistry between the two of us isn\u0027t worth fighting.\\n\\n Carefully, I slide down to the floor, one knee meeting the hard bamboo wood at a time. I don\u0027t miss the way he shudders when I lock my eyes with his, waiting for the rest of his instructions.\\n\\n He traces his fingertips around the outline of my face, gently stroking my temples, my cheeks, my lips. Tucking his fingers under my chin, he draws my face up until my head is tilted all the way back and my hair sways against my bottom.\\n\\n \"You are so fucking beautiful,\" he murmurs, before bending over to claim my lips. He drags my tongue into his mouth, teasing it in a desperate game of cat and mouse - wolf and sheep - with his own tongue.\\n\\n I lift my hands to touch his face but he barks out a rough command for me to keep them behind my back. I clasp them together, linking my fingers tightly. He moves his own hands to my breasts, testing their weight before rolling and pinching my nipples between his fingertips.\\n\\n My breath comes out in sharp, pleading gasps as he alternates between sliding his tongue into my mouth and sucking on my top lip, between squeezing the tips of my nipples and pushing my dress aside to probe the wetness between my legs. He nudges my slit with his knuckles, never moving my panties.\\n\\n Whimpering, I squeeze my eyes together. I feel like I\u0027ll come at the slightest provocation, at the slightest glance from him, and I grind my teeth. To punish me, he takes his hands and mouth away from my body. I convulse anyway, and then open my eyes. His cock springs forward and rubs against my cheek. Despite not having received directions from him, I flick my tongue out, taking his head into my mouth.\\n\\n He tangles his hands into the hair at the nape of my neck, pulling my mouth away from his body. \"You\u0027re so amazing. So good,\" he says, stroking my beck. \"You\u0027re going to learn, Sienna.\"\\n\\n I nod my head, ready.\\n\\n Willing.\\n\\n Craving.\\n\\n He teaches me slowly. The way to take my mouth down his length until he moans and rakes his hands through my long hair. The way he likes it when I use my teeth, placing just the tiniest bit of pressure on him. How he goes frantic when I squeeze my lips together, swiveling my tongue around his cock until he climaxes in my mouth.\\n\\n Afterward, when I move to sit down on my bottom, he shakes his head and says roughly, \"Stay exactly as you are.\" He sinks down to his own knees, going around my body in careful, animalistic circles as he drags my panties down to my knees with his mouth. I\u0027m shivering, dying for his touch. His hands are warm and gentle and rough as they guide my thighs apart. Then, he parts my wet slit with the hard tip of his tongue. \\n\\n And as I remain there, with the flooring hard beneath my weak knees and my fingernails raking my hands behind my back - as I remain there with him making me shudder and threatening to spank me if I so much as move my hands or body - I know that I\u0027m ready to learn everything about his world.\\n\\n Even at the risk of losing my heart. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-14.html","bookId":1869,"book":{"id":1869,"title":"Devoured (Devoured #1)","description":"Storyline: Devoured (Devoured #1) \\n Sienna\u0027s dreams lie in California, but when she discovers her grandmother\u0027s Nashville home has been foreclosed, she has no other choice but to move back to Music City, where she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she\u0027d see again - and who now holds the deed to her grandma\u0027s estate.
