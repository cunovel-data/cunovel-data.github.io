{"id":82625,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Less than an hour after I accept Kylie\u0027s friend request, my curiosity gets the best of me. What does she mean she knows a way to save this house? I message a single word reply that simply says: How?\\n\\n A shrill ding indicates that I\u0027ve received a brand new message seven minutes after I click send. Tossing the fitness magazine that I\u0027m attempting to read (and failing miserably because I\u0027m so worked up by Kylie\u0027s cryptic message) on top of my nightstand, I watch the screen and shift my teeth together as Kylie sends me a series of instant messages.\\n\\n Kylie Martin: Hmm . . . to be honest, what I\u0027ve got to tell you is probably something that should best be said in person and not online. Are you free this evening?\\n\\n I wait to answer because the instant messenger says she\u0027s still typing.\\n\\n Kylie Martin: I can pick you up at, say, 7pm and we can go into all the nitty-gritty details over dinner. My treat. Order the most expensive prime rib on the damn menu, if you want. It\u0027s on Lucas\u0027s dime.\\n\\n This time, I don\u0027t immediately answer because there\u0027s something that chafes me raw about going out to dinner and using Lucas\u0027s money to do so. It makes me feel . . . well, sort of cheap, even though I know that\u0027s ridiculous. I\u0027m sure his assistant takes other people out on all sorts of dinner and lunch dates, swiping Lucas\u0027s credit card at as many restaurants as she can reasonably get away with. If I go, tonight won\u0027t be any different.\\n\\n Except for the glaring fact that it so obviously is different.\\n\\n Kylie Martin: Just let me know something in the next hour, by 6pm, okay?\\n\\n I ease my butt down on the edge of my bed. The mattress dips down a tad in that particular spot and I make a vow to go for a run first thing tomorrow morning. Clutching the sides of the laptop, I stare at the messages at the bottom of the computer screen. I can\u0027t look away, even when the words start to blur into one another and all I\u0027m able to see is a dizzying swirl of blue and white and black.\\n\\n Does Kylie genuinely know something about Lucas that might delay the foreclosure? But even if she does, why would she betray her boss like that to help me? She\u0027s been working for Lucas for a long time - at least a couple years - and I\u0027m no one special to her. Other than this afternoon, I\u0027ve only met her one other time in my entire life and we hadn\u0027t had much to talk about other than the usual pleasantries.\\n\\n Then, another possible reason behind Kylie\u0027s invitation comes to me, knocking me upside the head like a brick. My thoughts shift to a completely different direction.\\n\\n What if her inviting me out is some sort of setup just to get me out of the house for something? Like Lucas and those two contractors coming back over here tonight so they can go over where to put the gaudy house he\u0027ll more than likely start building in two weeks or how much of Gram\u0027s cabin they should keep around for firewood.\\n\\n A frustrated noise escapes my lips. I press my fingers to the computer keys and type out a message in record time.\\n\\n Why can\u0027t you just tell me now? I demand.\\n\\n For five minutes, Kylie doesn\u0027t answer, but I see the little notification letting me know that she\u0027s typing in the center of the message box. I\u0027m impatient as I wait, tapping my fingertips on the flat space on either side of the mouse pad and grinding my teeth back and forth, the clicking noise coursing tiny prickles through my body. The teeth gnashing has got to be the worst in the history of awful nervous habits. It\u0027s one that I picked up as a kid after my parents dissolved their ill-fated marriage that not even relaxation massages or yoga have been able to control or stop.\\n\\n If Tori could see me right now, she\u0027d hand me a piece of gum and tell me that my teeth will be nubs by the time I\u0027m 40.\\n\\n I\u0027m so irritable today I\u0027d probably throw one of Tori\u0027s many stress balls at her head. Or five or six of them.\\n\\n Kylie Martin: Sorry, I\u0027m only willing to do it in person. If it\u0027s not tonight or by tomorrow evening, it will be too late to do anything.\\n\\n She\u0027s giving me an ultimatum. She\u0027s using a limited timeframe to coerce me into going out to dinner with her, and I don\u0027t like it one bit. Ever since my sophomore year at college, I\u0027ve tried hard to avoid people who do that to me because it\u0027s too reminiscent of the boy I dated all through high school who wanted to control everything I did.\\n\\n Preston had had different demands for something or another every other day, and each one was something he\u0027d change his mind about as soon as I followed through. By the time he ended things with me he swore I was co-dependent. Looking back at the situation now, I was.\\n\\n I still am.\\n\\n I focus on the screen again, attempting to ignore the bevy of emotions that thinking about Preston always seems to bring about. I don\u0027t love him. Tori says I probably never did and just went out with him because of my parental issues. Still, there\u0027s a bitter ping in the center of my chest.\\n\\n Swallowing back memories and exasperation and the sense of defeat, I send Kylie a reply: I don\u0027t like being bullied any more than I enjoy being given a couple hours to decide something.\\n\\n Kylie fires back a response seconds later. It\u0027s just dinner - it\u0027s not like I\u0027m asking you to get pregnant with my blue-haired love child and come live with us in Paris, you know? Like I wrote you before, I know a way you can save your grandmother\u0027s house. You just have to . . . trust me. I can\u0027t do anything more than that online.\\n\\n Massaging my upper nose in a slow, circular motion, I start tapping out a one-handed reply. It\u0027s only a few words, but it takes me a couple minutes and several tries to make sure I don\u0027t sound like the blubbering idiot I feel like right now.\\n\\n Where and what time?\\n\\n I wonder if she\u0027s smiling wherever she is because she immediately writes Yay! About a minute later, she adds, Fondue. Oh God, please tell me you love fondue? After I respond positively she types one last comment:\\n\\n Kickass - Fondue it is, then. I\u0027ll pick you up at your place at seven, and I promise to have you home by midnight. See, I\u0027m a respectful date and won\u0027t even try to get to second base. Catch up with you soon!\\n\\n I send Kylie a couple more messages asking her if she\u0027s going for casual or formal dress and whether she can park at the end of the driveway so Gram doesn\u0027t see her, but she doesn\u0027t answer either of them. I startle when I hear the front door slam. It rattles the bookshelf in the corner of my room, and I stumble off the bed, nearly breaking my neck on a pair of tall boots I left in the middle of the floor. Glancing out the window, I see my grandmother\u0027s Land Rover sitting in the driveway, backed in so that the open trunk is closest to the house.\\n\\n I heave a sigh of relief.\\n\\n A moment later, Gram yells up the stairs in a noticeably tired voice, \"Sienna?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here, Gram!\" I call out, slipping my feet into a pair of flip-flops.\\n\\n I reach the foyer as Gram shuffles through the front door, struggling with several bags of groceries. Quickly, I scoop them out of her hands where the plastic has started to make harsh indentations on her wrists. She offers me a grateful look.\\n\\n \"I stopped and picked up some food for you so you won\u0027t starve to death while you\u0027re here. All your favorites, and I\u0027ll even cook them,\" she says, just a touch too brightly.\\n\\n I can see into the back of her SUV from where I\u0027m standing. There are at least a dozen more bags in the trunk alone, not to mention what might be in the backseat. I feel a swell in my ribcage because my grandmother is on the verge of losing her house and having to spend money to relocate somewhere else. We both know she\u0027s not got the funds to do things like stock a house with the foods I enjoy.\\n\\n Instead of pointing this out to Gram, or immediately grilling her about where she\u0027s been, I move the bags in my right hand up and around my wrist and give her hand a tiny squeeze.\\n\\n \"Thanks, Gram,\" I say. Then, keeping my tone as light and as teasing as possible, I add \"You haven\u0027t cooked in, what? A year or two ago, when Seth was still in high school?\"\\n\\n Gram lets out a throaty chuckle. \"You\u0027re worth it.\"\\n\\n I insist she take a breather in the family room while I store the groceries. She doesn\u0027t give me hell, like usual, but goes willingly. It\u0027s so obvious that she\u0027s dead tired, so I try hard to remain as quiet as feasibly possible so I won\u0027t bother her while she rests.\\n\\n Unloading the bags is a monotonous task that reminds me of my time bagging groceries at the store up the street when I was in high school. I\u0027m grinning by time I finish because I have images of cart-racing with my co-workers and an even more vivid picture of racing wardrobe racks on the set of Echo Falls with Vickie, the other wardrobe assistant.\\n\\n If I ever got the nerve to do something like that, Tomas would shit a few bricks.\\n\\n The digital clock on the stove catches my eye. 5:45. I\u0027ll be with Kylie soon, and there\u0027s a chance - albeit not a very strong one - that I\u0027ll know what to do to make sure this house stays in Gram\u0027s possession.\\n\\n Speed walking into the living room, I say, \"Hey, I\u0027m going to - \" But I stop short. My grandmother is asleep on the couch, snoring, her chest rising and falling. \"Head out with a friend,\" I whisper. Turning to leave, I notice a balled up piece of paper in the corner of the doorway. I stoop down and pick it up, unraveling it. It\u0027s the grocery receipt from Gram\u0027s massive shopping expedition. But it\u0027s not the amount of money she has spent that makes my heart beat faster. It\u0027s the city and state the groceries were purchased in.\\n\\n Bowling Green, Kentucky, which is an hour drive from Nashville.\\n\\n It\u0027s the halfway point between here and the prison in Lexington that houses my mother.\\n\\n Honestly, I want to feel denial or shock or even anger - God knows I\u0027ve experienced all three emotion and often at once when it comes to Mom in the past. As I fold the receipt into tiny, even squares, though, the only thing I feel is a sharp pang in the middle of my chest.\\n\\n Kylie arrives early - a quarter \u0027til seven, when I\u0027m finishing up the last touches of my makeup - in the giant silver Cadillac SUV. She must not have gotten my message because she parks halfway up the drive and gets out of the car. As she practically skips toward the house, and into the path of the motion detection lights, I decide she looks like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in her blindingly white parka and with her short, black and blue hair poking out from beneath a slouchy white crochet hat. Tennessee\u0027s not that cold.\\n\\n She pauses in the circular walkway, tilts her head up until her dark eyes meets mine, then smiles and waves. Feeling myself flush from head to toe at being caught, I wiggle my fingers back at her. Why the hell is she so friendly when she hardly knows me? A moment later, she stops flapping her hand and disappears under the covered wraparound porch. The doorbell rings.\\n\\n Ah, shit! I should\u0027ve stopped her because of Gram!\\n\\n Suddenly feeling nauseous at the thought of my grandmother answering the door and having to face down Lucas\u0027s assistant, I speed down the steps. I\u0027m too late. My feet hit the final stair just in time to hear Kylie complimenting Gram on how beautiful the house is. My grandmother\u0027s not giving her accusing looks or asking her politely to leave, so I\u0027m caught off guard. Then I realize that Kylie wasn\u0027t in court yesterday. Gram apparently has never had the chance to meet her, but now that she has, she\u0027s charmed. Kylie\u0027s praise is making her blush hardcore.\\n\\n Lucas\u0027s assistant\u0027s sugary act is really starting to freak me out.\\n\\n \"Um, Gram, this is Kylie, she\u0027s - \" There\u0027s no way I can introduce her as Lucas\u0027s assistant. I shoot Kylie a pleading look.\\n\\n \"A friend from high school,\" she effortlessly adds. When Gram looks away for a split second, Kylie winks one of her brown eyes at me. It\u0027s heavily lined in metallic blue liner. \"I\u0027m in town before heading off for vacation in a couple days and hooked up with Sienna online.\"\\n\\n My grandmother\u0027s eyebrows draw together, and I can tell she\u0027s trying to place whether she\u0027s ever met Kylie before. I can read the emotions on Gram\u0027s face as she thinks back to graduation and homecoming dances and piano competitions. Coming up with nothing, she lifts her shoulders slightly and shakes her head, her gray hair springing around her face.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s so wonderful you stopped by for Sienna,\" Gram tells Kylie. Then she darts her blue eyes up to me, where I\u0027m still standing on the last step, staring at me questioningly. \"Did you want me to cook or - \"\\n\\n A lump forms in my throat. I know I shouldn\u0027t but I\u0027m thinking of the Bowling Green, Kentucky, receipt that I\u0027ve folded until there are hundreds of tiny creases lining it. It\u0027s upstairs, tucked under the magazine on my nightstand. I shouldn\u0027t keep it. I should\u0027ve dropped it where I found it.\\n\\n Because now I feel like a spy and the only thing I\u0027ll do when I see the slip of paper or Gram mentions cooking for me is wonder whether or not she was actually with my mom this afternoon. It\u0027s going to eat away at me until I have the chance to talk to her about it.\\n\\n No, I\u0027ll have to confront her in an intervention like scenario because my grandmother always clams up when it comes to talking about Mom.\\n\\n My mother tends to evoke that type of response from everyone.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been busy all day, so you should get some rest,\" I say, despite the constriction in my throat. \"Plus, Kylie\u0027s got this outrageously unlimited expense account for her job and she\u0027s taking me out to dinner to catch up. Isn\u0027t that right, Ky?\"\\n\\n Biting her lip - either to avoid laughing aloud at the emphasis I placed on the word \"unlimited\" or to keep from telling me to shut the hell up and that her name\u0027s not \"Ky\" - Kylie gives us a thumbs up, and replies, \"She\u0027s right. My boss lets me be a lush, and I take every advantage of it. And we better get going because I\u0027m starving and we have a reservation.\"\\n\\n Then, Kylie takes Gram\u0027s hands in between her gloved ones and offers her a genuine smile. Once again I\u0027m struck, curious as to why she\u0027s being so nice to the old woman her boss wants to evict. \"It was so great to meet you, Ms. Previn, and thanks for letting me borrow Sienna for a while. I promise I\u0027ll take good care of her.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s exactly what my ex-boyfriend said when he picked me up for junior prom, the night he talked me into giving me up my virginity.\\n\\n I fidget with the short hem of my chocolate-colored boatneck dress.\\n\\n Gram\u0027s nose wrinkles and crosses her arms over her chest as if she\u0027s in deep thought. At long last, she says, \"You girls have a good time. And absolutely no drinking and driving!\"\\n\\n It isn\u0027t until I\u0027m buckling my seatbelt in the Escalade, which smells like cigarettes and too much pine-scented air freshener, that I realize why my grandmother had such a strange expression on her face just before Kylie and I walked out the door.\\n\\n Gram and I have different last names - hers is Previn and mine is Jensen, my dad\u0027s last name and Mom\u0027s former married name. Not once had Gram mentioned what her last name is to Kylie.\\n\\n The Tuesday night crowd at the costly fondue restaurant on 2nd Avenue is scant, and Kylie and I are seated in a dimly lit, horseshoe-shaped booth. She removes her coat, revealing an oversized sweater with glasses-wearing owls covering it and a pair of stretchy pants. I\u0027m not one for bold colors or prints like Kylie - I mean, I\u0027ve played with the idea of dying my hair for years because it\u0027s that red - but the way she dresses suits her.\\n\\n As she rolls her coat into a tight cylinder shape and places it between us, she asks, \"You\u0027re not dissecting my outfit, are you?\"\\n\\n I feel my ears turn red. \"Of course not. Why would I do something like that?\"\\n\\n She makes a weird face, curling her lip up so it touches the tip of her nose, and rubs her chin with her index finger and thumb. \"Hmmm, I don\u0027t know. Maybe because it\u0027s your job. Hell, I find myself doing my job even when I\u0027m off the clock and critiquing every little piece of music I hear. For example, the music here\" - she moves closer, as if she\u0027s about to share an intimate secret, so I do the same - \"Is really, really shitty. But just so you know, I don\u0027t mind if you\u0027re taking creepy, wardrobe person notes about my clothes. I happen to like the way I dress.\"\\n\\n I almost want to tell her I\u0027m taking notes on how off-the-wall she is in general, but instead, I take a giant sip of my water to clear my throat before getting directly to the point. \"You said you know a way to save my grandmother\u0027s home, Kylie. That\u0027s the only reason I agreed to come out tonight. So . . . what is it?\" I drop my voice to a hush, adding, \"What do you know about Lucas?\"\\n\\n \"You know what I\u0027ve been wondering? Just how in the hell did you manage to keep a body like that growing up in a place with such amazing food?\" she says, evading my question. \"They deep fry everything. I\u0027ve been here literally a month and had to have Lucas advance me my clothing allowance for next season to buy looser fitting jeans.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you from?\" I ask.\\n\\n She grimaces, clenches her hands, before cheerfully saying, \"Oh, just Atlanta.\"\\n\\n Atlanta, Georgia. Where butter and bacon and pecans or more of a household necessity than they are here in Tennessee. Now, I\u0027m not exactly buying her comment about the amazing food, even if she has been living in L.A. for a while.\\n\\n Changing the subject, Kylie asks me about my childhood, about the school I went to, and what I did for fun, and I answer each question politely, taking the utmost care not to mention my mother. I feel myself growing more and more frazzled as each second seems to crawl by at a snail\u0027s pace.\\n\\n Finally when our first course arrives, I\u0027ve had just about had all I can take of Kylie\u0027s game of elusion. I place my palms flat on the table and clear my throat. She looks up at me, her dark eyes as enormous as the owls on her shirt. \"Kylie,\" I say as patiently as possible, \"Why did you want to bring me here?\"\\n\\n Dipping a broccoli spear into the pot of scalding cheese that sits in the center of table, she frowns. I watch as she swirls the broccoli around until it disintegrates, each second making my heart thud louder, making me feel like she\u0027s hiding something.\\n\\n \"Lucas wants you,\" she says and then shrugs before blowing on the broccoli.\\n\\n I already know this, but then a reason I didn\u0027t think of this afternoon for her wanting to see me hits me hard. I come to terms with a frightening possibility and drop the piece of bread I\u0027m chewing onto my plate. \"Oh god, you\u0027re not going to try to scald my face off with fondue or pour it in my lap because you\u0027re in love with your boss, are you?\" I ask in a shrill voice.\\n\\n Her head pops up from the cheese and she stares at me blankly. I\u0027m already making quick, jerky movements struggling to get myself out of the booth and away from this situation. To just leave her sitting here alone before drama ensues.\\n\\n Then she starts to laugh hysterically.\\n\\n That\u0027s it. First thing in the morning, I would find a way to contact Lucas to tell him to keep Kylie the hell away from me.\\n\\n Blinking back tears, she grabs my hand and pulls me back down. My knees lock up and I have no other choice but sit. I\u0027m wheezing like I\u0027ve just run a half marathon when she finally manages to squeeze words past her amusement. \"No, don\u0027t go, it\u0027s just that what you said - Dude, so gross. I mean, I love Lucas, but that\u0027s because I\u0027m forced to. Our parents would have my ass if I didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Wait - what?\"\\n\\n She smiles. \"Yep, guilty. I\u0027m Lucas\u0027s kid sister but only by a couple years.\"\\n\\n My hands automatically fly to my face, covering my embarrassment. \"I thought you were . . . your last name is Martin,\" I mumble slowly because there\u0027s a thickness in my throat.\\n\\n She holds up her left hand, placing it close to my face so that I\u0027m able to see the tattoo circling her ring finger. She twists her hand, back and forth, so I can read the Old English text that clearly says MARTIN. \"Eight years ago, the day I turned 18. His name was Bradley Martin and my marriage lasted about as long as the sex we had on my wedding night and was just as goddamn awful. Sorry, babe, you\u0027re going to have to reevaluate your opinion of me because I\u0027m not one of those assistants.\"\\n\\n How did I fail to notice what Kylie is to Lucas? Even though I\u0027ve witnessed very few of their interactions with one another, it\u0027s not like I\u0027ve ever seen him treat her like anything other than his assistant.\\n\\n I feel wretched for jumping to conclusions about her. I apologize, but she waves it away, grinning broadly. \"Are you kidding me? You\u0027re totally fine. You want to see real psycho assumptions, go and check out some of Lucas\u0027s fan message boards. These people are devout fans, know exactly who I am, and still bash the hell out of me.\"\\n\\n I swallow hard. \"Anything else I should know?\"\\n\\n Her tickled grin gradually gives way to a sheepish look. I\u0027ve always hated looks like this because it never indicates something pleasant. Then she drops her head, rearranging the silverware in front of her. \"I hate fondue. Like really, really loathe it.\"\\n\\n \"Then why did you ask me to come here? We could\u0027ve gone somewhere else. I\u0027m not picky. I\u0027m not . . .\" But I am sweaty and nervous. I\u0027m not so naive that I believe her shame face stems from a hatred of melted chocolate and cheese. No, Kylie\u0027s withholding something else.\\n\\n \"Because you wouldn\u0027t have come for him,\" she whispers, pointing. I follow her fingers across the restaurant, to a smaller booth, to where Lucas is sitting.\\n\\n My stomach pitches, and I cross my arms over it.\\n\\n Why is he in this restaurant spreading his . . . ugh, rockstar charm? Why can\u0027t I think or move or speak right now? The only thing I\u0027m able to do besides hold my stomach and wish myself smaller is observe. Lucas beckons a pretty brunette waitress over to him, whispers something into her ear. She smiles down seductively at him, nods her head, and swishes her hair over her shoulder as she goes over to do his bidding.\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t spare her a second glance.\\n\\n Now, he\u0027s standing, walking toward my table. A scarlet haze stretches from the back of my skull and wriggles its way to the front of my face, making me unable to see straight for several seconds. That\u0027s just how pissed I am at having been set up by Kylie and Lucas.\\n\\n I\u0027m still speechless, but now absolutely seething, when he comes back into focus.\\n\\n He towers over me, his intense hazel eyes blazing into mine as he waits for a response. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-4.html","bookId":1869,"book":{"id":1869,"title":"Devoured (Devoured #1)","description":"Storyline: Devoured (Devoured #1) \\n Sienna\u0027s dreams lie in California, but when she discovers her grandmother\u0027s Nashville home has been foreclosed, she has no other choice but to move back to Music City, where she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she\u0027d see again - and who now holds the deed to her grandma\u0027s estate.
