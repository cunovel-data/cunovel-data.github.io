{"id":12629,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER II MARRIAGE AND HEREDITY","content":"Heredity in General.—Heredity is a general phenomenon of natural life. The offspring resembles the parent to a greater or less degree. In the human species, also, children on the average resemble their own parents more closely than they resemble other persons, but the degree to which this resemblance is manifested is a variable one, and it remains an open question whether the concrete qualities and capabilities whereby the parents are distinguished from other persons are transmitted to their offspring by inheritance. It is possible that the qualities of the parents may not appear at all in the children; that they may appear somewhat modified, or in a very different form; that they may remain latent in one or more generations, to reappear in the grandchildren or great-grandchildren; or that the qualities of the parents may not appear to be present in the children at birth, but that as the latter grow up, these qualities may make their appearance at the same age at which they appeared in the parents. It is still in dispute whether qualities acquired by the parents are inherited by the offspring; nor is there general agreement as to what are the precise limits between inherited and acquired characters, respectively. This question as to the inheritance of acquired characters is one of profound importance; for if acquired characters are not inherited, racial improvement can be effected solely by means of the struggle for existence, and the continued elimination of the weaker elements of the species.[3] [78] Inheritance of Diseases.—The word “disease” is used here in the widest possible signification. Diseased parents as a rule procreate diseased children, or bring up diseased individuals. But the physical, mental, and moral defects of the parents may make their appearance in the children in a transmuted form. A disease in the parent, when transmitted by inheritance, may appear in the offspring as general weakness, either bodily, mental, or moral; or it may appear in the form of a predisposition to the particular disease; and conversely, that which in the parent is no more than predisposition to a disease, may appear in the offspring in the form of the actual disease. In concrete instances, it may be very difficult to determine whether persons are or are not diseased. Again, with respect to atavism and to the hereditary transmission of latent qualities, it is questionable whether, in cases in which the subject of investigation is not himself affected with disease, but his near relatives are so affected, we have reason to fear the hereditary transmission of harmful consequences to the offspring. It is especially with regard to the male sex that the question of the hereditary transmission of morbid qualities is so important, for, in marriage, it is the male partner who contributes the greater proportion of the diseases. It is not through inheritance only that diseases may be transmitted from parents to children; the same result may follow from the fact that parents and children live in such close association, or because children are brought up by their parents. The existence of morbid qualities or conditions in the parents may lead in the offspring, not only to the inheritance of disease, but to other disastrous results. Morbid conditions in either parent, besides being transmitted to the offspring by inheritance, may be communicated by the husband to the wife, or by the wife to the husband, either in the act of sexual intercourse, or through the close association of married life. Parents suffering from disease cannot bring up their children properly. The treatment of their own illness may be very costly, and may involve the expenditure of much time and pains, and these things work adversely to the interest of the children. Sickly parents whose children are likewise sickly are apt to endeavour to make up for the deficient quality of[79] their offspring by an increase in their number, whereby matters are made considerably worse. Those who enter into marriage when already ill are apt subsequently to reproach themselves upon their conduct towards their sexual partners; this is likely to react unfavourably upon the illness, and to disturb the married life, to the disadvantage of the children. Sickly parents die sooner than healthy ones, whereby the children are prematurely orphaned, and are exposed to the dangers of poverty. The state of engagement to marry (with consequent ungratified sexual excitement up to the time of marriage), sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, may all exercise an unfavourable influence upon the diseased organism, may favour or accelerate the course of the disease, and may even lead to its fatal issue. From the children’s point of view, all these things are extremely undesirable. Thus, there are certain persons to whom marriage is permissible, but who should on no account procreate children—that is to say, such a married pair may enjoy sexual congress, but must not fail to use efficient means for the prevention of conception. Individual Diseases.—(a) Of all diseases transmissible by inheritance, mental disorders pass most readily from parents to offspring, and undergo the least alteration as they pass. In the etiology of mental disorders, hereditary transmission plays an important part. (b) It is still undecided whether alcohol is a specific protoplasmic poison; but it is an indisputable fact that, among the offspring of those addicted to alcohol, the ill effects of the parental alcoholism may be displayed in other ways besides by the appearance of alcoholic tendencies in the next generation. The children of drunkards tend to be cruel, dissolute, dirty in their habits, hypersensitive, or themselves inclined to drink; and in any or all of these ways they may be a danger to society. For example, it has been found in wine-growing districts that the children born in any one year are stupider in proportion as the vintage of their birth-year was a good one. Often the effects of alcohol are better marked in the children of alcoholics than in the parents themselves. When both parents are drunkards, the children are apt to[80] suffer from moral insanity; and the offspring of drunkards tend to become criminals. Children whose parents were in a state of actual inebriety at the time of procreation will most probably be feeble-minded. Since alcohol increases sexual desire, even though it diminishes sexual potency, alcoholics tend to procreate more children than non-alcoholics; but any advantage that might ensue from the greater quantity of the offspring is more than outbalanced by their inferior quality. And because alcohol strengthens sexual desire, the number of alcoholics who were procreated by parents in a state of inebriety is considerable. Some experts contend that if the father is a drinker, the daughter is unable to suckle her own children. (c) What has been said regarding alcoholism applies also to some extent to morphinism. (d) Tuberculosis is not directly transmitted by inheritance. But the predisposition to tuberculosis is so transmitted; that is to say, it is regarded as unquestionable that an inferior power of resistance to the virus of tubercle passes by inheritance from parent to offspring. Those predisposed to tuberculosis tend to have a vigorous sexual impulse, and exhibit a high degree of fertility. (e) Gonorrh?a lessens or destroys fertility to such an extent that, in from 40 to 50 per cent. of childless marriages, the sterility is referable to gonorrh?al infection. Gonorrh?a, i.e. specific gonorrh?al urethritis or vaginitis, is not itself transmissible by inheritance; but gonorrh?a in the parent may lead to certain diseases in the offspring, and the most important of these is ophthalmia of the new-born—the commonest cause of blindness. (f) Syphilis is in most cases transmissible by inheritance. The children of syphilitic parents are commonly feeble-minded or idiotic; or bodily, mentally, or morally degenerate; and they possess an inferior power of resistance to diseases. The Age of the Parents.—The age of the parents at the time of procreation has a marked influence upon the health of the offspring. The parents should not be too young. It is not well that the mother should be less than twenty, or[81] the father less than twenty-four years of age. Many of the children of such extremely youthful parents are weakly, and have poor health. On the other hand, the parents should not be very old. When the mother is over forty and the father over fifty years of age, the children are apt to be weakly; also they are apt to be left orphaned at a comparatively early age. It is also undesirable that there should be a great difference between the ages of the parents. Thus the parents should be young, but not too young. The younger they are, the more children can they procreate—first of all, because their fertility is greater in youth, and, secondly, because their married life lasts longer. Qualitatively, also, the children of such marriages are usually healthier. As a matter of fact, the age indicated is the normal age for marriage—the age at which the great majority enter upon marriage. The Marriage of Near Kin.—We still lack precise information to enable us to decide whether the marriage of near kin is injurious to the offspring of such marriages. According to certain (unofficial) statistics, of 1000 marriages, from 7 to 11 are those of persons near akin. Naturally, in certain remote and inaccessible districts, the proportion of such marriages is greater than this. Two very different views have been put forward by scientific authorities. According to one school, the marriages of persons near akin either prove completely sterile, or else produce offspring defective in body or in mind. According to the other school, blood relationship has per se no influence upon the offspring of the unions of nearly-related persons; where the parents (in such marriages) are themselves free from defects transmissible by inheritance, there is no reason to anticipate that the offspring will be in any way defective, unless other noxious influences (in addition to the kinship of the parents), such as disease, debility, exhaustion from previous excesses, \u0026c., have been at work. But if such noxious influences have affected both parents, the danger of some congenital defect appearing in the children is very great. We certainly see many cases in which the marriage of near kin results in the procreation of large and thoroughly healthy families; but, in contrast with these, we also see many cases[82] in which the offspring of such marriages have proved non-viable or degenerate (especially, blind, deaf-mute, idiotic, insane, polydactylous, or affected with congenital developmental defects). Marriages between persons whose qualities are extremely divergent, and marriages between persons whose qualities are too closely similar, are alike undesirable. Neither the offspring of marriages between those belonging to different races nor the offspring of marriages between those too closely related appear to be a gain for the race. It is the degree of divergence or of resemblance which here plays the decisive part. It remains a subject of controversy whether the institution of exogamy originated from the fact that it was regarded as desirable to refresh the blood of the tribe by cross-fertilisation with the blood of another tribe. But it is incontestably established that since historic times began there has existed in the human race a natural antipathy to incestuous sexual relations, and more especially to incestuous marriages. The mental abnormalities seen in the offspring of incestuous marriages are to a large extent explicable from the fact that the incestuous relationship was itself the outcome of mental abnormality in those who entered upon that relationship. The possibility of the hereditary transmission of disease is greater in the case of the marriage of near kin than it is in ordinary marriages. When both parents suffer from the same transmissible defect, the likelihood that that defect will manifest itself in the offspring in a graver form is greatly increased. Thus, in the case of the offspring of nearly related persons, the probability of the appearance of certain transmissible defects is considerable. For perfectly healthy parents are rarities, and when husband and wife are closely related the probability that both will suffer from the same transmissible defect or disorder is relatively high. Disease in the Parents from the Legal Standpoint.—In relation to marriage, disease has a twofold significance: on the one hand, it may be a factor leading to the dissolution of the marriage (owing to divorce, nullity of marriage, venereal infection); on the other hand, the existence of disease may prevent marriage. Very naturally, the latter factor is of[83] preponderant importance, because we lay the chief stress upon prevention. It is for this reason that so little attention is paid to the legal significance of the former factor. Divorce.—In cases in which one partner to a marriage suffers from disease, divorce should be rendered as easy as possible. The interests of the children are often put forward as reasons against this course. There is no doubt that many married couples to-day refrain from separation or divorce solely because they regard it as to their children’s interest that they should continue to live together. But it is precisely on the ground of the children’s interest that such marriages ought to be dissolved, and that the child or children should remain with the healthy parent. The opposite course would only destroy the happiness of the healthy parent, without doing the other parent any good. Marriage-Prohibitions in Past Times.—The marriage-prohibitions of former times may be classified under two heads, ecclesiastical and civil. The leading principle of the canon law of marriage is the limitation to monogamy of the permissible forms of the sexual relationship. More strictly, indeed, we may say, the limitation to ecclesiastical marriage. Marriage is a sacrament, and therefore indissoluble; it conforms to ecclesiastical law only when certain formalities have been observed, and when no ecclesiastical prohibition has been infringed (differences in religious belief, broken vows, \u0026c.). Civil marriage prohibitions date chiefly from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They owe their origin to the fear lest parents should allow their offspring to become chargeable to the community, and especially to the poor-law authorities. Such marriage-prohibitions, of course, concerned chiefly the lower classes of the population, and especially mendicants, prostitutes, persons in receipt of poor relief, persons of disorderly life, offenders against the criminal law. A marriage concluded in defiance of such prohibitions involved the deprivation of certain legal rights, and also rendered the offenders liable to punishment. To-day, in the sphere of marriage-law, ecclesiastical law has largely lost significance, and continues to lose what little it still possesses, so that its marriage-prohibitions are coming to[84] possess little more than historical interest. The civil marriage prohibitions were repealed in the nineteenth century, because they were found to have no other effect than to increase the number of illegal unions and the births of illegitimate children, and because they merely increased the burdens upon the poor-law. Even in the nineteenth century, however, certain political parties—the Conservatives, for example—desire that these civil prohibitions should be reintroduced, but in this form, that the marriage of persons actually in receipt of poor relief should be forbidden, or that persons belonging to the lower classes should be allowed to marry only when able to demonstrate the possession of a small capital. Marriage-prohibitions still exist to-day. The difference is merely this, that in place of the ecclesiastical prohibitions and the civil prohibitions affecting members of the lower classes, moral, hygienic, and economic prohibitions and hindrances have come into being, affecting the middle classes. The State, as a rule, insists upon absolute celibacy in the case of its female employees. Soldiers and officers are hemmed in by rigid regulations, by which marriage is to a large extent rendered impossible; in the case of the proletariat, the liability to compulsory military service offers the greatest obstacle to early marriage. From Catholic priests, ecclesiastical prohibitions demand absolute celibacy. As the result of these various marriage-prohibitions, many persons who would probably have been able to procreate healthy children are prevented marrying. But there is to-day hardly any difficulty in the way of the marriage of persons whose union is likely to lead to the procreation of defective children. At most, minors, certified lunatics, confirmed drunkards, wards in chancery, and near relatives are forbidden to marry. Proposed Reforms.—Increasing attention is, however, being paid to the possible legal applications of the doctrine of evolution. Even those who are opposed to any radical reforms see that persons suffering from communicable venereal disease must be unconditionally forbidden, on pain of very severe punishment, not merely to contract marriage, not merely to practise sexual intercourse, but to perform any act, of whatever kind, by which they could communicate infection. The existing state of the law, by which, notwithstanding the great[85] frequency of such occurrences, isolated instances only of the transmission of venereal diseases are punished (for example, the case of the nurse who infects the child entrusted to her care), is altogether unsatisfactory; the communication of any kind of venereal infection, in any possible way, should be severely punished. Those who recognise the need for improving the human species by purposive selection go much further than this. They desire that every person with regard to whom there is strong reason to believe that his or her offspring would be diseased, and every man or woman in a state in which he or she would transmit infection to the sexual partner, should be stringently forbidden to marry. Such persons are: those with disease of the central nervous system, mental disorder, mental weakness, epilepsy, hysteria, idiocy; those with diminished moral responsibility; those suffering from syphilis, gonorrh?a, tuberculosis, rachitis; cripples, \u0026c. Objections.—The following objections are raised by those who are adverse to the institution of such marriage prohibitions as these: (a) They limit personal freedom, and even in some cases actually abolish it. (b) By means of marriage-prohibitions, it is possible to limit the number of legitimate children born, but not the number of children as a whole, since persons to whom legal marriage is forbidden will in that case procreate illegitimate children. But it is far from being desirable that this should happen. All the defects previously enumerated would be present in such children, and their birth would be unconditionally harmful to society. It is statistically proved that marriage-prohibitions lead to an increase in the number of illegitimate births. In Bavaria, for example, down to the year 1868, the local authorities imposed an unconditional veto upon the marriage of persons supported solely by wage-earning; against this prohibition there was no appeal whatever. In the year 1868 was passed the law relating to marriage and domicile, by which most of the former marriage-prohibitions were repealed. The sequel of this was that, whereas from 1854 to 1868 illegitimate births constituted 22 per cent. of all births, in the seven years following 1868 the percentage of illegitimate births fell to 12·6 per cent. (c) It is better, say the objectors, that a[86] man suffering from venereal disease should marry, for in that case he makes only one woman unhappy and procreates a few children only. But if he is forbidden to marry, he has intercourse with numerous women, especially with prostitutes, he infects many women, and procreates more children. (d) Marriage-prohibitions do not prevent unhappy marriages only, but also those which would be likely to prove happy. Many couples enter into marriage for other reasons than desire for sexual intercourse. There are also many sick persons upon whom marriage exercises a curative influence—curing, or at least alleviating, the disease from which they suffer. For example, many alcoholics become abstemious or temperate as a result of marriage; many weakly and delicate girls become strong and healthy women when they marry. Many marriages are happy although husband and wife do not practise sexual intercourse; and it is by no means uncommon for a woman to marry a sick man simply because she pities him, and wishes to act as his sick-nurse. (e) Marriage-prohibitions accentuate class contrasts. (f) Diseased persons commonly have no offspring. (g) Diseased persons to whom, after consideration of their case, marriage is permitted, have the responsibility taken out of their hands, and consequently tend to lose all sense of responsibility. (h) Marriage-prohibitions interfere with natural selection, inasmuch as they render impossible the acquirement of immunity to disease and the process of regeneration. (i) It would be a logical counterpart to marriage-prohibitions to compel healthy persons to enter upon marriage—a course that is obviously impracticable. The Right View.—The prohibitions suggested in the section on “Proposed Reforms” are sound in principle. The prevention of the birth of such children as are born in the absence of effective prohibitions of this kind, effects an enormous social economy. The children of thoroughly healthy parents, who have married from love, are the healthiest; such marriages are, therefore, to be promoted. But it does not follow that all other marriages than these should be prevented. This would go too far, and would, moreover, be utterly impracticable. Marriage-prohibitions must not err by excess, and too energetic intervention in these matters is undesirable. For such a course of action would render[87] it impossible for very many persons to marry; and, in fact, no one with any disease, mild or severe, and no one with any kind of defect of body or mind, could enter upon marriage. All that is practicable is, in the first place, to prevent the marriage of those who are obviously suffering from serious disease; and, in the second place, to prevent the marriage of persons exhibiting defects of bodily development, or in whom the sexual characters are inadequately developed, even though such persons cannot be said to be suffering from disease (e.g. women with weakly-formed breasts, with poor hips, with a badly-formed pelvis, \u0026c.) Passing now to consider the objections in detail, (a) is true. But the mode of action of a State which introduces such marriage-prohibitions differs quantitatively only, not qualitatively, from the mode of action of other States to-day. The marriage-prohibitions now in existence certainly limit personal freedom; but in other departments of the activity of the modern State we encounter numerous institutions by which individual liberty is far more seriously impaired. Consider, for instance, compulsory military service: the modern State insists that all young men shall undergo a medical examination, and that those found to be physically fit shall devote the best years of their life to the service of the State. Besides, when we are considering the common weal, the question of individual liberty is no longer decisive. The notion that it is an inalienable right of every human being to found a family may be quietly dismissed as a piece of egregious sentimentality. (b) By punitive measures, and by the diffusion of enlightenment, it is possible to prevent the classes of persons here mentioned from entering into illegitimate sexual relationships. Women will not allow themselves to become entangled with men to whom, for the reasons here considered, marriage is forbidden; first of all, because such men are considered to be of inferior worth; in the second place, because, in view of the fact that an intimacy (liaison) cannot lead to marriage, the intimacy is regarded as fruitless, (c) The probability of transmitting venereal infection and the probability of procreating children are both considerably greater in cases of long-enduring intimacy than where there are numerous, brief, frequently-changed sexual relationships. (d) It is altogether[88] exceptional for marriage to exercise a curative influence upon the progress of a disease, and this probability is one which can never be counted upon. Once the marriage is contracted, sexual intercourse and the procreation of children cannot be prevented. (f) As regards persons suffering from tuberculosis and alcoholism, the reverse of what was stated in objection (f) is definitely established. (h) The data available as to the immunising influence of inherited diseases against the same diseases accidentally acquired (e.g. of congenital syphilis against acquired syphilis) are extremely debatable. They seem, indeed, to show provisionally that such an immunising effect is non-existent. The question of regeneration is still obscure, and requires thorough investigation. It is certainly possible that in some cases intermarriage between the diseased and the healthy may lead, not to the deterioration, but to the improvement of the race, owing to the fact that thereby favourable elements are introduced into the family. The principal argument against this idea of regeneration is that, from marriages in which both parties are healthy, healthier offspring unquestionably result, than from marriages in which one or both parties are diseased. The resulting postulate is, that the healthy should marry the healthy. How to Effect Reforms.—No general rules can be formulated regarding the marriage of persons suffering from disease. The majority of diseases are of such a nature that their existence can be established only by means of direct medical examination. In most cases, medical examination will not justify the assertion that the particular person must be altogether forbidden to marry, but only that this particular person ought not to marry some other specifically indicated individual; should the question arise regarding another proposed marriage (that is to say, with a different individual), then a fresh medical examination will be desirable. For example, we cannot lay it down as a general rule that the marriage of persons suffering from tuberculosis must be unconditionally forbidden; all we are able to say is, that when anyone suffering from tuberculosis desires to marry, that person ought first to submit to a thorough medical examination. It is therefore necessary that prior to marriage there should be a medical examination made by one of a number of doctors officially appointed for this purpose.[89] As a result of their examination, these officials will give an opinion, whether the marriage of the person they have examined with some other person specifically named is or is not desirable in the interest of the common weal. There is yet another way in which this idea might be carried out. (a) Everyone wishing to marry should provide, in addition to the various documents which are now requisite to the official sanction of marriage, a medical certificate to the effect that he is free from any disease which should prevent his marriage with the other party named in the certificate. Many, indeed, wish that, in addition to this certificate, another should be provided, to the effect that of the two parties about to enter into marriage, the woman will be presumably competent to suckle her child, to bring it up, and to educate it; the man, that he will presumably be competent to undertake the two duties last named. (b) Before the marriage is solemnised, the physicians of both parties should hold a consultation, and decide jointly whether the marriage is permissible. (c) Everyone who enters into marriage should be under statutory obligation to insure his life, and this also involves a complete medical examination. (d) Many consider that the following method of procedure would suffice. Before the marriage is solemnised, both parties should be medically examined, and the result of the medical examination of each should be communicated to the other. If they then wish to proceed with the marriage, no further obstacles should be interposed. The Tendency of Evolution.—The importance of marriage-prohibitions on hygienic grounds is continually increasing. Recent legislation in many States of the American union furnish us with the best examples of this evolutionary tendency. In the social life of the future, marriage-prohibitions on hygienic grounds will play a very important part. The detailed treatment of this question at any particular time and in any particular country will of course depend upon the acquirements of medical science. It is probable that the general principles will be statutorily determined, and that medical examination will ultimately be made compulsory in the case of everyone contemplating marriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2854/78729.html","bookId":1212,"book":{"id":1212,"title":"The Elements of Child-protection","description":"简介： During the latter half of the nineteenth century, the importance of child-protection gained a far wider recognition.The nineteenth century has been well named The Century of the Child.
