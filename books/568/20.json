{"id":33459,"no":20,"title":"A HOTEL ACQUAINTANCE.","content":"\n ON ARRIVING at St. Louis Tom sought out a modest inn known as the St. Louis Hotel. The price per day was but a dollar, and this served as a recommendation in his eyes. The war had not yet enhanced the price of all articles, and even the best hotels charged but two dollars and a half, where now the tariff is four and five dollars. \n \n Tom had two objects in view. He wanted to see St. Louis, and he thought it possible that he might find some employment—of what sort he had no very definite idea. \n \n He devoted a day or two to visiting different parts of the city, regarding everything with the fresh interest of a boy who was making his first journey. He, too, though he did not know it, excited the attention and curiosity of some of the guests of the hotel. \n \n One evening, as he sat in the public room, reading a New York paper which he had picked up from the table, he was accosted by a young man of thirty or thereabouts, tall, and rather loosely put together, who was smoking a cigar. He tendered another to Tom, with the remark: \n \n “Will you try a cigar, young man?” \n \n 117 \n \n “No, thank you, sir, I don’t smoke,” answered Tom, politely. \n \n “You’ll learn by and by. Been long in the city?” \n \n “Not long.” \n \n “Going further West?” \n \n “I expect to go to California.” \n \n “Indeed! Anybody with you?” \n \n “No, I am traveling alone.” \n \n The young man, for some reason, seemed to hear this with satisfaction. \n \n “Got any friends out there—in California, I mean?” \n \n “Not that I know of.” \n \n “Going out to make your fortune, I reckon?” \n \n “I will if I get the chance,” said Tom, smiling. \n \n Of course he was not disposed to communicate his real errand to a stranger. \n \n “Shall you start soon?” \n \n “I don’t know exactly. I am trying to find something that will help to pay my expenses,” said our hero. \n \n He had no objection to admitting this, for his new acquaintance might possibly put him in the way of procuring such employment as he desired. \n \n “Do you think that would be possible?” he asked. \n \n “I am not sure about that. Would you expect all your expenses to be paid, or have you money enough to pay a part of them?” \n \n The stranger seemed interested to hear Tom’s answer. \n \n “Oh, I have some money of my own,” answered Tom, quickly. “I have enough to carry me through, but I want to save some of it.” \n \n 118 “So, so,” returned the young man, seeming gratified. “I am glad to hear that.” \n \n “Why?” asked Tom. \n \n “Because a friend of mine and myself propose to start for California in two or three days, and we would like to engage a boy to go with us, and do any little services that we might require. Now, I don’t want to make any promises, but I will speak to my friend, and see if he is willing to join me in engaging you.” \n \n “Thank you,” said Tom, joyfully, for he had not expected so soon to make an engagement. \n \n “Oh, there will be no occasion to thank me; it will be a mutual arrangement,” said the other, waving his hand. “What is your name?” \n \n “Tom Thatcher.” \n \n “I suppose you can bring recommendations of honesty, and so on?” \n \n “I don’t know as I can give you any recommendations, for I know no one in St. Louis,” said Tom, “but I hope you will not doubt my honesty.” \n \n “I don’t speak for myself,” said the stranger. “I am easily satisfied. My friend is more particular, but I think he will accept my guarantee. If now you had any certificate from your minister at home. By the way, where do you come from?” \n \n “From Wilton, in the State of New York.” \n \n “By the way, what will be your views in regard to pay?” \n \n “I haven’t thought of that,” answered Tom, truly. \n \n “I suppose not. I will tell you my own idea, but, of course, shall have to consult my friend.” \n \n 119 “Certainly, sir.” \n \n “We would require you to pay your own traveling expenses, but we would allow you fifteen or twenty dollars a week salary. How does that strike you?” \n \n “I didn’t expect so much,” answered Tom, honestly, much elated, indeed, by what he regarded a munificent offer. \n \n “I am willing to agree to twenty, but I can’t speak for my friend.” \n \n “I will agree to fifteen,” said Tom. \n \n “Then, my young friend, we will confer together again. I may be able to see my friend this evening and arrange matters. Suppose you meet me in this place to-morrow, say at ten o’clock in the forenoon.” \n \n “All right, sir.” \n \n The young man arose, and left the hotel. \n \n Tom was quite elated at the thought that he was likely to make so profitable an engagement. \n \n “Fifteen to twenty dollars a week!” he said to himself. “That will be lucky and no mistake! It’s rather an improvement on three dollars a week. I hope I sha’n’t lose the place from having no recommendations. If they will only wait I am sure Mr. Julian would send me one.” \n \n It never occurred to Tom that the stranger who proposed to employ him might stand in greater need of a recommendation, and might find it considerably more difficult to obtain one. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2060/58631.html","bookId":568,"book":{"id":568,"title":"Tom Thatcher\u0027s Fortune","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy boy of sixteen, with bright eyes, and a smiling sun-browned face.
