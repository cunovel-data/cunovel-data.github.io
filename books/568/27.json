{"id":33466,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. A FRIEND IN NEED.","content":"IT IS NOT to be supposed that Tom was indifferent to the sudden appearance of one who seemed sent by heaven to his help. He looked eagerly in the direction of the new comer. The honest face and sturdy figure were not unknown to him. “It is Mr. Brush!” he exclaimed joyfully. “Yes,” said that individual, approaching, “it is Peter Brush. What has this rascal been up to?” “Take care how you call me names, you clodhopper!” exclaimed Burnett, furiously, by no means pleased to see the man he had striven so hard to avoid. “I may be a clodhopper, but I am not a scoundrel and a thief!” returned Brush. Burnett felt that he was in a tight place. Would it be possible to deceive Mr. Brush? At any rate, he decided to try it. “Sir,” he said forcibly, controlling his temper, “you are mistaken. I don’t blame you, for you are misled by what you have just seen.” “If I am mistaken, perhaps you will explain why you have bound that boy, and taken his money and watch?” “The boy is a thief, and has cheated me.” 149 Peter Brush releases Tom from the hands of the robber. [Page 149.] 150 “What!” exclaimed Tom, his eyes flashing. “Wait a minute,” said Brush. He stepped up to our hero, and drawing a knife, severed the cords that bound him, while Percy Burnett looked on in annoyance. “Now, Tom,” said Brush, “what have you got to say to this charge?” “I say it’s a lie!” asserted Tom boldly. “Take care, you young rascal!” exclaimed Burnett, making a step toward our hero, now on his feet. “Easy, now,” said Peter Brush. “The boy’s under my protection. Let him alone!” “The boy’s in my employment,” said Burnett, “and I’ll thank you not to interfere.” “I shall interfere all the same, if I think it necessary,” said Brush, composedly. “I am not in your employment,” said Tom, facing Burnett. “I’ve had enough of your service.” “You say the boy is a thief,” continued Brush. “Can you prove it?” “Yes, he managed to pick my pocket of a considerable sum of money, which he has now in his possession.” “Don’t believe him, Mr. Brush,” said Tom. “Easy now, Tom. How large a sum of money?” asked Brush. That was just what Burnett could not tell, not knowing how much Tom had in his possession. “I can’t say exactly. It’s over a hundred dollars,” he said, after a pause. 151 “How about the watch? Did you have two?” for Burnett had one of his own besides the one he had taken from Tom. “No; the watch belongs to the boy.” “Yet you took it?” “Precisely. I took it in part compensation for the money of which he had robbed me.” “But you have the money, too.” “Who are you, anyway, and what business have you to interfere between me and my servant?” burst forth Burnett, angrily, finding himself cornered. “Your servant!” said Tom, proudly. “I am not your servant, nor anybody’s servant.” “That’s a fact, Tom,” said Mr. Brush. “This fellow ought to be your servant.” “If you are going to insult me, I’ll leave you,” said Burnett, suiting the action to the word. “Come back, you thief!” cried Brush, covering him with his rifle. “Do you mean to murder me?” asked Percy Burnett, alarmed. “No, but there’s a little formality you must go through before you bid us good-by.” “What is that?” “Hand over the boy’s watch and money.” “There’s the watch,” said Burnett, giving it back with an ill grace. “The money is mine and I will keep it.” “I don’t think you will,” said Brush, composedly. “I will have you arrested for highway robbery,” exclaimed Burnett, angrily. 152 “I don’t think you will find any one to believe you, Jim Dobson.” Burnett started, and a look of dismay overspread his face. “My name is Percy Burnett,” he said, haughtily, recovering himself. “Is it? It used to be Jim Dobson, well known to the police of Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis. You were recognized at St. Joe. Now will you hand over the money?” With a muttered curse Burnett, alias Dobson, threw Tom’s pocket-book on the ground. “Now I suppose I may go,” he said, sullenly. “When the boy has examined his wallet to see if the money’s all there.” “I know it is,” said Tom, “he hasn’t had time to open it.” “Then you can go, Mr. Dobson. Good-by! Take my advice and lead a better life in the future.” “Curse your advice!” said Burnett, as he strode rapidly away, leaving Tom and his new friend together in the gathering darkness.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2060/58638.html","bookId":568,"book":{"id":568,"title":"Tom Thatcher\u0027s Fortune","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy boy of sixteen, with bright eyes, and a smiling sun-browned face.
