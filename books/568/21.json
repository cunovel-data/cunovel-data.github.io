He afterward learned that he went by the name of Percy Burnett. \n \n Of course Tom kept his appointment punctually the next morning. He was too anxious about the engagement to risk losing it by any negligence. \n \n About a quarter after ten Mr. Burnett lounged into the hotel office. \n \n “You are on hand, I see,” he said, taking an armchair near the settee on which Tom was sitting. \n \n “Yes, sir.” \n \n “I have seen my friend about the little matter I spoke of yesterday,” said Mr. Burnett, “but I find he won’t be ready to start for California for four weeks.” \n \n Tom’s countenance fell. He had been buoyed up by the thought of the engagement, and now all seemed to be over. \n \n Percy Burnett watched our hero’s expressive face, and read his disappointment. \n \n He proceeded: \n \n “I thought at first that we should have to give up our121 plan,” he said, “but on second thoughts I may still be able to carry it out.” \n \n Tom’s face brightened. \n \n “I am not willing to wait here four weeks for my friend,” continued Mr. Burnett. “It would only be a waste of valuable time. I should be glad to have you go with me as a—a sort of private secretary, but I can’t afford to pay you as much as I mentioned yesterday. I think I said twenty dollars, did I not?” \n \n “Fifteen to twenty dollars,” corrected Tom. \n \n “Just so. That would be too much for me to pay alone.” \n \n “I would go for less,” said Tom, eagerly. \n \n “I suppose you would hardly agree to say twelve?” \n \n Twelve! It was just four times as much as Tom had ever hitherto received, and he quickly answered: \n \n “I will be willing to go for that.” \n \n “Give me your hand, Tom,” said Mr. Burnett, appearing to be much pleased. “You are a gentleman, and I engage you on the spot. How soon can you go?” \n \n “I can go immediately,” answered Tom, promptly. \n \n “That is well. You won’t complain then if I ask you to be ready to-morrow?” \n \n “I will be on hand, sir.” \n \n “Very well, meet me here to-morrow at the same hour.” \n \n Mr. Burnett rose, and shaking hands with Tom, left the room. \n \n Tom reflected with great satisfaction on the engagement he had made. To be sure he had his own traveling122 expenses to pay, but these would be largely diminished by the weekly salary he was to receive. How long it would take to go across the plains he had no idea, but whether long or short, it appeared as if he had made an excellent arrangement. \n \n The next day the two started together from St. Louis. Mr. Burnett had a small satchel with him, which he handed to Tom to carry. \n \n “This will be the first of your duties,” he said, with a smile. \n \n Tom took the satchel cheerfully. \n \n “I must ask you to be very careful of it,” said Mr. Burnett. “It contains articles of considerable value.” \n \n “I will be very careful, sir.” \n \n “It is chiefly jewelry and watches,” explained his employer. “I am carrying them to San Francisco, as I expect to realize large profits on them. I should think there might be five thousand dollar’s worth in that satchel. You wouldn’t suppose it, would you?” \n \n “No, I should not,” said Tom, sincerely. \n \n “You understand now why I asked if you could bring any recommendations of honesty,” said Mr. Percy Burnett. \n \n “Yes, sir.” \n \n “I am trusting you with a very valuable package. Now what is to prevent your giving me the slip, and carrying it off?” \n \n “I hope you don’t think there is any danger, Mr. Burnett!” \n \n “None at all. I have perfect confidence in your123 honesty. If I had not, I certainly would not have dreamed of engaging you.” \n \n “Thank you, sir.” \n \n “My friend would probably have been more particular. He has a more suspicious temperament. For my part, I pride myself on my skill in reading faces, even when seen for the first time. Now, when I saw you, I said to myself: ‘That is an honest, reliable boy. I never saw him before, but I can tell by his appearance that he has been well brought up and is honest as the day is long.’” \n \n Tom was gratified by this compliment, and said: \n \n “Thank you, sir; I am sure you won’t regret your confidence in me.” \n \n This conversation took place in the cars. They were on their way to St. Joseph—popularly called St. Joe—a place from which most parties started on their overland trips to California. \n \n Tom paid his own fare, as had been arranged between them, and though the disbursement was considerable, consoled himself with the thought that, at the end of a week, he would be in receipt of twelve dollars from his employer. \n \n Indeed, Mr. Burnett had very considerately offered to pay the first week’s salary in advance, but this Tom had declined. \n \n “I would rather not receive the money until it is earned,” he said. \n \n “By the way, Tom, that is a very pretty watch and chain of yours,” said Mr. Burnett. \n \n 124 \n \n “Yes, sir, so I think.” \n \n “How much did you pay for it, if I may venture to ask?” \n \n “I did not buy it, sir. It was made a present to me just before I left New York.” \n \n “A very nice present, upon my word. I advise you to be very careful of it. It might excite the cupidity of some dishonest person who might be tempted to steal it.” \n \n “Yes, sir; I will be very careful of it. Thank you for the hint.” \n \n “I once had a watch and chain stolen myself,” continued Mr. Burnett. “It was in the cars, too. A well-dressed person sat down beside me, and engaged me in conversation. I suspected nothing, but shortly after he had left me at a way-station I discovered that my watch and chain were gone.” \n \n “Did you never recover them?” asked Tom, with interest. \n \n “Never. I suppose the fellow pawned or sold them.” \n \n They were nearing St. Joe when a rakish-looking fellow entered the cars, and seemed to recognize Burnett. \n \n “How are you, old fellow?” he said. \n \n Percy Burnett glanced instinctively at Tom, and answered, stiffly: \n \n “Very well, thank you. This is my friend, Mr. Thatcher.” \n \n “How are you, Thatcher?” asked the new-comer, laughing. “I say, Jim, what’s your game?” \n \n “I really don’t understand you,” said Burnett. “Come into the next car with me a moment.” \n \n 125 The other laughed, and followed Burnett. \n \n “I don’t much fancy that fellow,” thought Tom. “Why did he call Mr. Burnett Jim? His name is Percy.” \n \n He was still wondering that his employer should have such a friend, when Burnett came back. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2060/58632.html","bookId":568,"book":{"id":568,"title":"Tom Thatcher\u0027s Fortune","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy boy of sixteen, with bright eyes, and a smiling sun-browned face.
