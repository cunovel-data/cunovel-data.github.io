{"id":2046,"title":"Coyote Blue","description":"Storyline: This is an accelerating comedy with shadows setting off the wry, polished humor. Trickster deities thrive on contrariety, which is why one finds them bringing life into dead landscapes and disorder into order. A Santa Barbara insurance salesman\u0027s too-tidily-contained lifestyle, far from the Crow reservation he grew up on, is an irresistible target for Coyote, who wants to make sure his chosen people don\u0027t forget him. Coyote descends on Sam Hunter like one of Job\u0027s plagues, albeit a charmingly disingenuous one. \"Why me? Why not someone who believes?\" asks Sam, suffering from god-induced chaos. \"This is more fun,\" says Coyote. He\u0027s right.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/coyote-blue.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":18,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
