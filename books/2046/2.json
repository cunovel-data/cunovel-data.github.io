{"id":109787,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"CHAPTER 3 The Machines of Irony Bring Memory Santa Barbara After Sam\u0027s secretary gave him the address of his appointment he hung up the cellular phone and punched the address into the navigation system he\u0027d had installed in the Mercedes so he would always know where he was. Wherever Sam was, he was in touch. In addition to the cellular phone he wore a satellite beeper that could reach him anywhere in the world. He had fax machines and computers in his office and his home, as well as a notebook-sized computer with a modem that linked him with data bases that could provide him with everything from demographic studies to news clippings about his clients. Three televisions with cable kept his home alive with news, weather, and sports and provided insipid entertainments to fill his idle hours and keep him abreast of what was hot and what was not, as well as any information he might need to construct a face to meet a face: to change his personality to dovetail with that of any prospective client. The by-gone salesman out riding on a shoeshine and a smile had been replaced by a shape-shifting shark stalking the sale, and Sam, having buried long ago who he really was, was an excellent salesman. Even as some of Sam\u0027s devices connected him to the world, others protected him from its harshness. Alarm systems in his car and condo kept criminals at bay, while climate control kept the air comfortable and compact discs soothed away distracting noise. A monstrous multi-armed black machine he kept in his spare bedroom simulated the motions of running, cross-country skiing, stair climbing, and swimming, while monitoring his blood pressure and heart rate and making simulated ocean sounds that stimulated alpha waves in the brain. And all this without the risk of the shin splints, broken legs, drowning, or confusion that he might have experienced by actually going somewhere and doing something. Air bags and belts protected him when he was in the car and condoms when he was in women. (And there were women, for the same protean guile that served him as a salesman served him also as a seducer.) When the women left, protesting that he was charming but something was missing, there was a number that he could call where someone would be nice to him for $4.95 a minute. Sometimes, while he was getting his hair cut, sitting in the chair with his protections and personalities down, the hairdresser would run her hands down his neck, and that small human contact sent a lonesome shudder rumbling through him like a heartbreak. \"I\u0027m here to see Mr. Cable,\" he said to the secretary, an attractive woman in her forties. \"Sam Hunter, Aaron Assurance Associates. I have an appointment.\" \"Jim\u0027s expecting you,\" she said. Sam liked that she used her boss\u0027s first name; it confirmed the personality profile he had projected. Sam\u0027s machines had told him that James Cable was one of the two main partners who owned Motion Marine, Inc., an enormously successful company that manufactured helmets and equipment for industrial deep-sea diving. Cable had been an underwater welder on the rigs off Santa Barbara before he and his partner, an engineer named Frank Cochran, had invented a new fiberglass scuba helmet that allowed divers to stay in radio contact while regulating the high-pressure miasma of gases that they breathed. The two became millionaires within a year and now, ten years later, they were thinking of taking the company public. Cochran wanted to be sure that at least one of the partners could retain controlling interest in the company in the event that the other died. Sam was trying to write a multi-million-dollar policy that would provide buy-out capital for the remaining partner. It was a simple partnership deal, the sort that Sam had done a hundred times, and Cochran, the engineer, with his mathematical way of thinking, his need for precision and order, his need to have all the loose ends tied up, had been an easy sale. With an engineer Sam simply presented facts, carefully laid out in an equationlike manner that led to the desired answer, which was: \"Where do I sign?\" Engineers were predictable, consistent, and easy. But Cable, the diver, was going to be a pain in the ass. Cable was a risk taker, a gambler. Any man who had spent ten years of his life working hundreds of feet underwater, breathing helium and working with explosive gas, had to have come to terms with fear, and fear was what Sam traded in. In most cases the fear was easy to identify. It was not the fear of death that motivated Sam\u0027s clients to buy; it was the fear of dying unprepared. If he did his job right, the clients would feel that by turning down a policy they were somehow tempting fate to cause them to die untimely. (Sam had yet to hear of a death considered \"timely.\") In their minds they created a new superstition, and like all superstitions it was based on the fear of irony. So, the only lottery ticket you lose will be the winning one, the one time you leave your driver\u0027s license at home is the time you will be stopped for speeding, and when someone offers you an insurance policy that only pays you if you\u0027re dead, you better damn well buy it. Irony. It was a tacit message, but one that Sam delivered with every sales pitch. He walked into Jim Cable\u0027s office with the unusual feeling of being totally unprepared. Maybe it was just the girl who had thrown him, or the Indian. Cable was standing behind a long desk that had been fashioned from an old dinghy. He was tall, with the thin, athletic build of a runner, and completely bald. He extended his hand to Sam. \"Jim Cable. Frank told me you\u0027d be coming, but I\u0027m not sure I like this whole thing.\" \"Sam Hunter.\" Sam released his hand. \"May I sit? This shouldn\u0027t take long.\" This was not a good start. Cable gestured for Sam to sit across from him and sat down. Sam remained standing. He didn\u0027t want the desk to act as a barrier between them; it was too easy for Cable to defend. \"Do you mind if I move this chair over to your side of the desk? I have some materials I\u0027d like you to see and I need to be beside you.\" \"You can just leave the materials, I\u0027ll look them over.\" Technology had helped Sam over this barrier. \"Well, actually it\u0027s not printed matter. I have it in my computer and I have to be on the same side of the screen as you.\" \"Okay, I guess that\u0027s fine, then.\" Cable rolled his chair to the side to allow Sam room on the same side of the desk. That\u0027s one, Sam thought. He moved his chair, sat down beside Cable, and opened the notebook computer. \"Well, Mr. Cable, it looks like we can set this whole thing up without any more than a physical for you and Frank.\" \"Whoa!\" Cable brought his hands up in protest. \"We haven\u0027t agreed on this yet.\" \"Oh,\" Sam said. \"Frank gave me the impression that the decision had been made - that this was just a meeting to confirm the tax status and pension benefits of the policy.\" \"I didn\u0027t know there were pension benefits.\" \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here,\" Sam said. It wasn\u0027t why he was there at all. \"To explain them to you.\" \"Well, Frank and I haven\u0027t gotten down to any specifics on this. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s a good idea at all.\" Sam needed misdirection. He launched into the presentation like a pit bull/Willy Loman crossbreed. As he spoke, the computer screen supported his statements with charts, graphs, and projections. Every five seconds a message flashed across the screen faster than the eye could see, but not so fast that it could not nibble on the lobes of the subconscious like a teasing lover. The message was: BE SMART, BUY THIS. Sam had designed the program himself. The BE SMART part of the message could be modified for each client. The options were: BE SEXY, BE YOUNG, BE BEAUTIFUL, BE THIN, BE TALL, and Sam\u0027s personal favorite, BE GOD. He\u0027d come up with the idea one night while watching a commercial in which six heavily muscled guys got to run around on the beach impressing beautiful women presumably because they drank light beer. BE A STUD, DRINK LIGHT. Sam finished his presentation and stopped talking abruptly, feeling that he had somehow forgotten something. He waited, letting the silence become uncomfortable, letting the conversation lay on the desk before them like a dead cat, letting the diver come to the correct conclusion. The first one to speak loses. Sam knew it. He sensed that Cable knew it. Finally, Jim Cable said, \"This is a great little computer you have. Would you consider selling it?\" Sam was thrown. \"But what about the policy?\" \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea,\" Cable said. \"But I really like this computer. I think it would be smart to buy it.\" \"Smart?\" Sam said. \"Yeah, I just think it would be a smart thing to do.\" So much for subliminal advertising. Sam made a mental note to change his message to: BE SMART, BUY THE POLICY. \"Look, Jim, you can get a computer like this in a dozen stores in town, but this partnership policy is set up for right now. You are never going to be younger, you\u0027ll never be in better health, the premium will never be lower or the tax advantage better.\" \"But I don\u0027t need it. My family is taken care of and I don\u0027t care who takes control of the company after I\u0027m dead. If Frank wants to take a policy out on me I\u0027ll take the physical, but I\u0027m not betting against myself on this.\" There it was. Cable was not afraid and Sam knew no way to instill the fear he needed. He had read that Cable had survived several diving accidents and even a helicopter crash while being shuttled to one of the offshore rigs. If he hadn\u0027t glimpsed his mortality before, then nothing Sam could say would put the Reaper in his shaving mirror. It was time to walk away and salvage half of the deal with Cable\u0027s partner. Sam stood and closed the screen on the computer. \"Well, Jim, I\u0027ll talk to Frank about the specifics of the policy and set up the appointment for the physical.\" They shook hands and Sam left the office trying to analyze what had gone wrong. Again and again the fear factor came up. Why couldn\u0027t he find and touch that place in Jim Cable? Granted, his concentration had been shot by the morning\u0027s events. Really, he\u0027d done a canned presentation to cover himself. But to cover what? This was a clean deal, cut and dried. When he climbed back into the Mercedes there was a red feather lying on the seat. He brushed it out onto the street and slammed the door. He drove back to his office with the air conditioner on high. Still, when he arrived ten minutes later, his shirt was soaked with sweat. CHAPTER 4 Moments Are Our Mentors Santa Barbara There are those days, those moments in life, when for no particular reason the senses are heightened and the commonplace becomes sublime. It was one of those days for Samuel Hunter. The appearance of the girl, the wanting she had awakened in him, had started it. Then the Indian\u0027s presence had so confused him that he was fumbling through the day marveling at things that before had never merited a second look. Walking back into his outer office he spied his secretary, Gabriella Snow, and was awed for a moment by just how tremendously, how incredibly, how child-frighteningly ugly she was. There are those who, deprived of physical beauty, develop a sincerity and beauty of spirit that seems to eclipse their appearance. They marry for love, stay married, and raise happy children who are quick to laugh and slow to judge. Gabriella was not one of those people. In fact, if not for her gruesome appearance, an unpleasant personality would have been her dominant feature. She was good on the phone, however, and Sam\u0027s clients were sometimes so relieved to be out of her office and into his that they bought policies out of gratitude, so he kept her on. He\u0027d hired her three years ago from the resume she had mailed in. She was wildly overqualified for the position and Sam remembered wondering why she was applying for it in the first place. For three years Sam had breezed by her desk without really looking at her, but today, in his unbalanced state, her homeliness inspired him to poetry. But what rhymed with Gabriella? She said, \"Mr. Aaron is very anxious to talk to you, Mr. Hunter. He requested that you go right into his office as soon as you arrived.\" \"Gabriella, you\u0027ve been here three years. You can call me Sam.\" Sam was still thinking about poetry. Salmonella? \"Thank you, Mr. Hunter, but I prefer to keep things businesslike. Mr. Aaron was quite adamant about seeing you immediately.\" Gabriella paused and checked a notepad on her desk, then read, \"\u0027Tell him to get his ass in my office as soon as he hits the door or I\u0027ll have him rat-fucked with a tire iron. \" \"What does that mean?\" Sam asked. \"I would assume that he would like to see you right away, sir.\" \"I guessed that.\" Sam said. \"I\u0027m a little vague on the rat-fucked part. What do you think, Gabriella?\" Gabriella, Gabriella, As fair as salmonella. \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know. You might ask him.\" \"Right,\" Sam said. He walked down the hall to Aaron Aaron\u0027s outer office, composing the next line of his poem along the way. It wouldn\u0027t surprise me in the least If you were mistaken for a beast. Aaron Aaron wasn\u0027t Aaron\u0027s real name: he had changed it so his insurance firm would be the first listed in the yellow pages. Sam didn\u0027t know Aaron\u0027s real name and he had never asked. Who was he to judge? Samuel Hunter wasn\u0027t his real name either, and it was certainly less desirable alphabetically. Aaron\u0027s secretary, Julia, a willowy actress/model/dancer who typed, answered phones, and referred to hairdressers as geniuses, greeted Sam with a smile that evinced thousands in orthodontia and bonding. \"Hi, Sam, he\u0027s really pissed. What did you do?\" \"Do?\" \"Yeah, on that Motion Marine deal. They called a few minutes ago and Aaron went off.\" \"I didn\u0027t do anything,\" Sam said. He started into Aaron\u0027s office, then turned to Julia. \"Julia, do you know what rat-fuck means?\" \"No, Aaron just said that he was going to do it to you for sucking the joy out of his new head.\" \"He got a new head? What\u0027s this one?\" \"A wild boar he shot last year. The taxidermist delivered it this morning.\" \"Thanks Julia, I\u0027ll be sure to notice it.\" \"Good luck.\" Julia smiled, then held the smile while she checked herself in the makeup mirror on her desk. Walking into Aaron\u0027s office was like stepping into a nineteenth-century British hunt club: walnut paneling adorned with the stuffed heads of a score of game animals, numbered prints of ducks on the wing, leather wing-back chairs, a cherry-wood desk clear of anything that might indicate that a business was being conducted. Sam immediately spotted the boar\u0027s head. \"Aaron, it\u0027s beautiful.\" Sam stood in front of the head with his arms outstretched. \"It\u0027s a masterpiece.\" He considered genuflecting to appeal to the latent Irish Catholic in Aaron, but decided that the insincerity would be spotted. Aaron, short, fifty, balding, face shot with veins from drink, swiveled in his high-backed leather chair and put down the Vogue magazine he had been leafing through. Aaron had no interest in fashion; it was the models that interested him. Sam had spent many an afternoon listening to Aaron\u0027s forlorn daydreams of having a showpiece wife. \"How was I to know that Katie would get fat and I would get successful? I was only twenty when we got married. I thought the idea of getting laid steadily was worth it. I need a woman that goes with my Jag. Not Katie. She\u0027s pure Rambler.\" Here he would point to an ad in Vogue. \"Now, if I could only have a woman like that on my arm...\" \"She\u0027d have you surgically removed,\" Sam would say. \"Sure, be that way, Sam. You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to think that getting a little strange could cost you half of what you own. You single guys have it all.\" \"Stop romanticizing, Aaron. Haven\u0027t you heard? Sex kills.\" \"Sure, suck the joy out of my fantasies. You know, I used to look forward to sex because it was fifteen minutes when I didn\u0027t have to think about death and taxes.\" \"If you do think about death and taxes it lasts half an hour.\" \"That\u0027s what I mean, I can\u0027t even get distracted with Katie anymore. Do you know what someone with my income has to pay in taxes?\" The question came up in every one of their conversations. They had worked together for almost twenty years and Aaron always treated Sam as if he were still fifteen years old. \"I know exactly what someone with your income is supposed to pay in taxes, about ten times what you actually pay.\" \"And you don\u0027t think that that weighs on me? The IRS could take all this.\" Sam rather liked the vision of a team of IRS agents loading large dead animal heads into Aaron\u0027s Jag and driving off with antlers out every window while Katie stood by shouting, \"Hey, half of those are mine!\" No matter how much Aaron attained, he would never let go of his fear of losing it long enough to enjoy it. In his mind\u0027s eye, Sam imagined Aaron mournfully watching as they carried the wild boar head out by the tusks. \"This thing is gorgeous,\" Sam said. \"I think I\u0027m getting a woody just looking at it.\" \"I named it Gabriella,\" Aaron said proudly, forgetting for a moment that he was supposed to be angry. Then he remembered. \"What the fuck did you just pull over at Motion Marine? Frank Cochran is talking lawsuit.\" \"Over a little subliminal advertising? I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Subliminal advertising! Jim Cable fainted after that stunt you pulled. They don\u0027t even know what happened yet. It could be a heart attack. Are you out of your fucking mind? I could lose the agency over this.\" Sam could see Aaron\u0027s blood pressure rising red on his scalp. \"You thought it was a great idea last week when I showed it to you.\" \"Don\u0027t drag me into this, Sam, you\u0027re on your own with this one. I\u0027ve pulled some shit in my time to push the fear factor, but I never had a client attacked by an Indian, for Christ\u0027s sake.\" \"Indian?\" Sam almost choked. He lowered himself very gently into one of the leather wing-backs. \"What Indian?\" \"Don\u0027t bullshit me, Sam. I taught you everything you know about bullshitting. Right after you left his office Jim Cable walked out of the Motion Marine building and was attacked by a guy dressed up as an Indian. With a tomahawk. If they catch the guy and he tells that you hired him, it\u0027s over for both of us.\" Sam tried to speak but could find no breath to drive his voice. Aaron had been his teacher, and in a twisted, competitive way, Aaron was his friend and confidant, but he had never trusted Aaron with his fears. He had two: Indians and cops. Indians because he was one, and if anyone found out it it would lead to policemen, one of whom he had killed. Here they were, after twenty years, paralyzing him. Aaron came around the desk and took Sam by the shoulders. \"You\u0027re smarter than this, kid,\" he said, softening at Sam\u0027s obvious confusion. \"I know this was a big deal, but you know better than to do something desperate like that. You can\u0027t let them see that you\u0027re hungry. That\u0027s the first rule I taught you, isn\u0027t it?\" Sam didn\u0027t answer. He was looking at the mule deer head mounted over Aaron\u0027s desk, but he was seeing the Indian sitting in the cafe grinning at him. Aaron shook him. \"Look, we\u0027re not totally screwed here. We can draw up an agreement signing all your interest in the agency over to me and backdate it to last week. Then you would be working as an independent contractor like the other guys. I could give you, say, thirty cents on the dollar for your shares under the table. You\u0027d have enough to fight the good fight in court, and if they let you keep your license you\u0027ll always have a job to come back to. What do you say?\" Sam stared at the deer head, hearing Aaron\u0027s voice only as a distant murmur. Sam was twenty-six years and twelve hundred miles away on a hill outside of Crow Agency, Montana. The voice he was hearing was that of his first teacher, his mentor, his father\u0027s brother, his clan uncle: a single-toothed, self-proclaimed shaman named Pokey Medicine Wing. CHAPTER 5 The Gift of a Dream Crow Country - 1967 Sam, then called Samson Hunts Alone, stood over the carcass of the mule deer he had just shot, cradling the heavy Winchester.30�C30 in his arms. \"Did you thank the deer for giving its life up for you?\" Pokey asked. As Samson\u0027s clan uncle, it was Pokey\u0027s job to teach the boy the ways of the Crow. \"I thanked him, Pokey.\" \"You know it is the Crow way to give your first deer away. Do you know who you will give it to?\" Pokey grinned around the Salem he held between his lips. \"No, I didn\u0027t know. Who should I give it to?\" \"It is a good gift for a clan uncle who has said many prayers for your success in finding a spirit helper on your vision quest.\" \"I should give it to you, then?\" \"It is up to you, but a carton of cigarettes is a good gift too, if you have the money.\" \"I don\u0027t have any money. I will give you the deer.\" Samson Hunts Alone sat down on the ground by the deer carcass and hung his head. He sniffed to fight back tears. Pokey kneeled beside him. \"Are you sad for killing the deer?\" \"No, I don\u0027t see why I have to give it away. Why can\u0027t I take it home and let Grandma cook it for all of us?\" Pokey took the rifle from the boy, levered a cartridge into the chamber, then let out a war whoop and fired it into the air. Samson stared at him as if he\u0027d lost his mind. \"You are a hunter now!\" Pokey cried. \"Samson Hunts Alone has killed his first deer!\" he shouted to the sky. \"Soon he will be a man!\" Pokey crouched down to the boy again. \"You should be happy to give the deer away. You are Crow and it is the Crow way.\" Sam looked up, his golden eyes shot with red and brimming with tears. \"One of the boys at school says that the Crow are no more than thieves and scavengers. He said that the Crow are cowards because we never fought the white man.\" \"This boy is Cheyenne?\" Pokey said. \"Yes.\" \"Then he is jealous because he is not Crow. The Crow gave the Cheyenne and the Lakota and the Blackfoot a reason to get up in the morning. They outnumbered us ten to one and we held our land against them for two hundred years before the white man came. Tell this boy that his people should thank the Crow for being such good enemies. Then kick his ass.\" \"But he is bigger than me.\" \"If your medicine is strong you will beat him. When you go on your fast next week, pray for warrior medicine.\" Samson didn\u0027t know what to say. He would go to the Wolf Mountains next week for his first vision quest. He would fast and pray and hope to find a spirit helper to give him medicine, but he wasn\u0027t sure he believed, and he didn\u0027t know how to tell Pokey. \"Pokey,\" the boy said finally, very quietly, his voice barely audible over the hot breeze whistling through the prairie grass, \"a lot of people say that you don\u0027t have no medicine at all, that you are just a crazy drunk.\" Pokey put his face so close to Samson\u0027s that the boy could smell the cigarette-and-liquor smell coming off him. Then, softly, in a gentle, musical rasp he said, \"They\u0027re right, I am a crazy drunk. The others are afraid of me \u0027cause I\u0027m so crazy. You know why?\" Sam sniffed, \"Nope.\" Pokey reached into his pocket and pulled out a small buckskin bundle tied with a thong. He untied the thong and unfolded the buckskin on the ground before the boy. In it lay an array of sharp teeth, claws, a tuft of tan fur, some loose tobacco, sweet grass, and sage. The largest object was a wooden carving of a coyote about two inches tall. \"Do you know what this is, Samson?\" Pokey asked. \"Looks like a medicine bundle. Ain\u0027t you supposed to sing a song when you open it?\" \"Don\u0027t have to with this one. Nobody ever had medicine like this. I ain\u0027t never showed it to anyone before.\" \"What are those teeth?\" \"Coyote teeth. Coyote claws, coyote fur. I don\u0027t tell people about it anymore because they all say I\u0027m crazy, but my spirit helper is Old Man Coyote.\" \"He\u0027s just in stories,\" Sam said. \"There isn\u0027t any Old Man Coyote.\" \"That\u0027s what you think,\" Pokey said. \"He came to me on my first fast, when I was about your age. I didn\u0027t know it was him. I thought it would be a bear, or an otter, because I was praying for war medicine. But on the fourth day of my fast I looked up and there was this young brave standing there dressed in black buckskins with red woodpecker feathers down his leggings and sleeves. He was wearing a coyote skin as a headdress.\" \"How did you know it wasn\u0027t just somebody from the res?\" \"I didn\u0027t. I told him to go away and he said that he had been away long enough. He said that when he gave the Crows so many enemies he promised that he would always be with them so they could steal many horses and be fierce warriors. He said it was almost time to come back.\" \"But where is he?\" Samson asked. \"That was a long time ago and no one has seen him. If he was here they wouldn\u0027t say you were crazy.\" \"Old Man Coyote is the trickster. I think he gave me this medicine to make me crazy and make me want to drink. Pretty Eagle, who was a powerful medicine man then, told me how to make this bundle and he told me that if I was smart I would give it to someone else or throw it in the river, but I didn\u0027t do it.\" \"But if it is bad medicine, if he is your spirit helper and doesn\u0027t help you...\" \"Does the sun rise just for you, Samson Hunts Alone?\" \"No, it rises all over the world.\" \"But it passes you and makes you part of its circle, doesn\u0027t it?\" \"Yeah, I guess so.\" \"Well maybe this medicine is bigger than me. Maybe I am just part of the circle. If it makes me unhappy then at least I know why I am unhappy. Do you know why you are unhappy?\" \"My deer...\" \"There will be other deer. You have your family, you are good in school, you have food to eat, you have water to drink. You can even speak Crow. When I was a boy they sent me off to a BIA school where they beat us if we spoke Crow. Next week, if your heart is pure, you will get a spirit helper and have strong medicine. You can be a great warrior, a chief.\" \"There aren\u0027t any chiefs anymore.\" \"It will be a long time before you are old enough to be a chief. You are too little to be unhappy about the future.\" \"But I am. I don\u0027t want to be Crow. I don\u0027t want to be like you.\" \"Then be like you.\" Pokey turned away from the boy and lit another cigarette. \"You make me angry. Give me your knife and I will show you how to dress this deer. We will throw the entrails in the river as a gift to the Earth and the water monsters.\" Pokey looked at Samson, as if waiting for the boy to doubt him. \"I\u0027m sorry, Pokey.\" The boy unsnapped the sheath on his belt and drew a wickedly curved skinning knife. He held it out to the man, who took the knife and began to field-dress the deer. As he drew the blade down the deer\u0027s stomach he said, \"I am going to give you a dream, Samson.\" Samson looked away from the deer into Pokey\u0027s face. There were always gifts among the Crow - gifts for names, Sun Dance ceremony gifts, powwow gifts at Crow Fair, naming ceremony gifts, gifts for medicine, gifts to clan uncles and aunts, gifts for prayers: tobacco and sweet grass and shirts and blankets, horses and trucks - so many gifts that no one could ever really be poor and no one ever really got rich. But the gift of a dream was very pure, very special, and could never be repaid. Samson had never heard anyone give a dream before. \"I dreamed that Old Man Coyote came to me and he said, \u0027Pokey, when everything is right with you, but you are so afraid that something might go wrong that it ruins your balance, then you are Coyote Blue. At these times I will bring you back into balance. This dream that I dreamed I give to you, Samson.\" \"What does that mean, Uncle Pokey?\" \"I don\u0027t know, but it is a very important dream.\" Pokey wiped the knife on his pants and handed it to Samson, then hoisted the deer up on his shoulders. \"Now, who are you going to give this deer to?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/coyote-blue/page-2.html","bookId":2046,"book":{"id":2046,"title":"Coyote Blue","description":"Storyline: This is an accelerating comedy with shadows setting off the wry, polished humor.
