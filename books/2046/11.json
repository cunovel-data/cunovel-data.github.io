{"id":109796,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"CHAPTER 22\n Sprinkling the Son of the Morning Star\n Santa Barbara\n After almost twenty years as a salesman, Sam found that when he was confused his head filled with homilies that pertained to the profession. Win an argument, lose a sale. If you look hungry, you will be. You can\u0027t sell if you don\u0027t pitch. There were hundreds of them. He\u0027d been running them through his mind for hours, trying to find some clue as to what he should do. The one that kept returning was Never confuse motion with progress.\n To leave the house in search of Calliope without a clue as to where she might be would be movement for the sake of movement. Progress would be actually finding a clue to her whereabouts. He had no idea where to start looking for clues, so he lay on his bed and smoked, and tried to convince himself that he didn\u0027t want her.\n She\u0027s probably found some other guy, he thought. Losing the kid is just an excuse, a cowardly Dear John letter. It was just a one-night stand and I refuse to let it mean more to me than it meant to her. I\u0027ve got my life back, intact, and there\u0027s no room for a young girl and a child. Nope. I\u0027ll rest up today and get back to work tomorrow. After I close a couple of deals, this week will just seem like a bad dream. It was a good rationalization. Unfortunately, he didn\u0027t believe a word of it; he was worried about her.\n Sam closed his eyes and tried to imagine the pages of his appointment book. It was a visualization he used to relax, a salesman\u0027s version of counting sheep. He saw the days and weeks spread out in front of him, and he filled in the blanks with lunches and prospects. By each of the names he made mental notes on how he would approach the pitch. Before long he was lost in a world of presentations and objections; the image of the girl faded away.\n As he started to doze off he heard the sound of heavy breathing. He rolled on his side and steamy hot dog breath hit him in the face. He didn\u0027t open his eyes. There was no need to. He knew Coyote had returned. Perhaps if he feigned sleep the trickster would go away, so he lived there in the land of dog breath. A wet nose prodded his ear. At least he hoped it was a nose. With Coyote\u0027s sexual habits it could be.... No, he still smelled the breath. It was the nose.\n I\u0027m asleep, go away. I\u0027m asleep, go away, he thought. He\u0027d seen opossums try the same method to fool oncoming semi trucks, and it was working about as well for him. He felt the coyote climb onto the bed. Then he felt a paw on each of his shoulders. He groaned as he thought a truly sleeping guy might groan. Coyote whimpered and Sam could feel the canine nose press against his own.\n Dog breath, Sam mused, seems to have no distinction to it, yet it is distinctly dog breath. You could be at the cologne counter at Bloomingdale\u0027s, and someone could mist your wrist with an atomizer, and a single whiff would reveal the elusive scent to be dog breath as surely as if it had been squozen straight from the dog. Yet, what a wide spectrum of foulness dog breath can span, both in odor and humidity. This particular version of dog breath, he felt, is especially steamy, and carries a top note of stale cigarettes and coffee, as well as the usual fetid meat and butthole smells found in more common dog breath. This, he thought, is supernatural dog breath. I\u0027m not likely to be breathed upon by another dog in my lifetime that has recently enjoyed a Marlboro over a cup of Java.\n Despite his effort to distract himself with dog breath aesthetics, Sam\u0027s tolerance was wearing out and he thought he might sneeze or throw up any second. Coyote licked him on the mouth.\n \"Yuck!\" Sam sat upright and wiped his mouth on his arm. \"Ack!\" He shivered involuntarily and looked at the big coyote, who grinned at him from the end of the bed. \"There was no need for that,\" Sam said.\n Coyote whimpered and rolled over on his back in submission.\n Sam got up from the bed and grabbed his cigarettes from the nightstand. \"Why are you back? You said you were gone for good.\"\n Coyote began to change into his human form. No longer afraid, Sam watched the transformation with fascination. In a few seconds Coyote sat on the bed in his black buckskins wearing the coyote-skin headdress. \"Got a smoke?\" he asked.\n Sam shook one out of the pack and lit it for the trickster. Sam took a small plastic box from his shirt pocket and held it out to Coyote. \"Breath mint?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"I insist,\" Sam said.\n Coyote took the box and shook out a mint, popped it in his mouth, and handed the box back to Sam. \"The girl is going to Las Vegas.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care.\" The lie tasted foul in his mouth.\n \"If she tries to take her child from the biker she will be hurt.\"\n \"It\u0027s not my problem. Besides, she\u0027ll probably find another guy to help her out.\" Sam felt both righteous and cowardly for saying it. This role he was playing no longer fit. Quickly he added, \"I don\u0027t need the trouble.\"\n \"In the buffalo days your people used to say that a wife stolen and returned was twice the wife she had been.\"\n \"They aren\u0027t my people and she\u0027s not my wife.\"\n \"You can be afraid, just don\u0027t act like it.\"\n \"What does that mean? You\u0027re worse than Pokey with your fucking riddles.\"\n \"You lost Pokey. You lost your family. You lost your name. All you have left is your fear, white man.\" Coyote flipped his cigarette at Sam. It hit him in the chest and hot ashes showered on the bed.\n Sam patted out the embers and brushed himself off. \"I didn\u0027t ask for you to come here. I don\u0027t owe the girl anything.\" But he did owe her. He wasn\u0027t sure what for yet, except that she had cut something loose in him. Why couldn\u0027t he cut loose the habit of fear?\n Coyote went to the bedroom window and stared out. Without turning he said, \"Do you know about the Crows who scouted for General Custer?\"\n Sam didn\u0027t answer.\n \"When they told Custer that ten thousand Lakota and Cheyenne warriors were waiting for him at the Little Bighorn he called them liars and rode on. The Crow scouts didn\u0027t owe Custer anything, but they painted their faces black and said, \u0027Today is a good day to die. \"\n \"The point?\" Sam bristled.\n \"The point is that you will never know what they knew - that courage is its own reward.\"\n Sam sat down on the edge of the bed and stared at Coyote\u0027s back. The red feathers across the buckskin shirt seemed to move on the black surface of Coyote\u0027s shirt. Sam wondered if he might not be light-headed from prolonged dog breath inhalation, but then the feathers drew a scene, and in a whirl of images and feathers, Sam was back on the reservation again.\n There were three of them: boys hiding in the sagebrush by the road that led into the Custer Battlefield National Monument. Two were Crow, one Cheyenne. They were there on a dare that had started in ninth-grade gym class. The largest boy, the Cheyenne, was from the Broken Tooth family - descendants of a warrior who fought with Crazy Horse and Red Cloud on this very land.\n \"You going to do it?\" said Eli Broken Tooth. \"Or are you full of shit like all Crows?\"\n \"I said I\u0027d do it,\" Samson said. \"But I\u0027m not going to be stupid about it.\"\n \"What about you, breed?\" Eli asked Billy Two Irons. \"You a chickenshit?\" Broken Tooth had been taunting Billy about his mixed blood for the whole school year and citing his own \"pure Indian\" lineage. The fact was that in buffalo days the mortality rate had been so high for young plains warriors that a woman might have three or four husbands in her lifetime, and have children by them all. Sometimes one of the husbands was a white man, yet since they all traced their kinship through their mother\u0027s line, the white ancestor could easily be forgotten.\n Billy said, \"I\u0027ll bet you got a few whiteys in your wigwam you don\u0027t even know about, Broken Dick.\"\n Samson laughed and the others shushed him. The security guard was making a pass by the monument\u0027s high wrought-iron gate. They ducked their heads. A flashlight beam passed over them, paused, and moved on as the guard turned to walk up the hill toward the Custer burial site.\n \"You going to do it?\" Eli asked.\n \"Once he\u0027s past the grave he has to go check on the Reno site. He\u0027ll take the jeep for that. When we hear the jeep, we\u0027ll go.\"\n \"Sure you will,\" said Eli.\n \"You coming?\" Samson asked. He was more than a little afraid. The monument was federal land, and this was a time when an Indian causing trouble on federal land was something the government was going to great lengths to discourage after the Alcatraz takeover and the killings at Pine Ridge.\n \"I don\u0027t have to go,\" Broken Tooth said. \"My people put him there. I\u0027ll just sit here and twist up a doobie while you girls do your thing.\" He grinned.\n \"The gate will be the bitch,\" Billy said. They looked at the fifteen-foot iron spears suspended between two stone pillars. There were only two cross members they could use as footholds.\n They watched the guard amble the hundred yards down the hill to the visitor center. When they heard the jeep fire up, Samson and Billy took off. They hit the gate at the same time. The gate swung with the impact and clanged against the chains and padlock that held it closed. They scrambled up the bars, then hung over spearpoints and dropped to the asphalt. As they let go the chain sent a loud clang ringing down the valley. They both landed on their butts.\n Samson looked to Billy. \"You okay?\"\n Billy jumped to his feet and dusted off his jeans. \"How come the Indians in the movies can do this shit in complete stealth?\"\n \"Vocational training,\" Samson said. He started running up the hill toward the monument. Billy followed.\n \"Snake ahead,\" Samson said as he ran.\n \"What?\"\n \"Snake,\" Sam repeated breathlessly. He leapt into the air over the big diamondback rattler that was lying in the road, warming itself on the asphalt. Billy saw the snake in time to pull up and slide on some loose gravel within striking distance.\n When he heard Billy\u0027s shoes sliding he stopped and turned.\n Billy said, \"You were saying \u0027Snake, right?\"\n \"Back away and go around, Billy.\" Samson was so out of breath he could hardly talk. The rattler coiled.\n \"I thought you were saying \u0027Steak. I was wondering, Why is he yelling \u0027Steak\u0027 at me?\"\n \"Back away and go around.\"\n \"\u0027Snake. Well, I guess this explains it.\" Billy backed slowly away, then once out of striking distance ran a wide arc around the snake and up the hill.\n Samson fell in beside him. The monument was still a hundred yards away. \"Pace yourself,\" he said.\n \"Did you say \u0027Snake\u0027 again?\" Billy said between pants.\n Rather than answer, Samson fell into a trot.\n The monument was a twenty-foot granite obelisk set on a ten-foot base at the top of a hill that overlooked the entire Little Bighorn basin.\n \"Let\u0027s do it,\" Samson said, heaving in breaths. The hill had been longer and steeper than he\u0027d thought.\n Billy unzipped his pants and stood beside Samson, who had already bared his weapon. \"You know,\" Billy said, \"it would have been easier to gang up on Eli and beat the shit out of him.\"\n \"I think I hear the jeep coming back,\" Samson said. A long yellow stream arced out of Billy and splashed the side of the monument. \"Then you better get going.\" Samson strained. \"I can\u0027t.\"\n Billy grunted, trying to force his urine to run faster. \"Go, man. That\u0027s headlights.\"\n \"I can\u0027t.\"\n Billy finished and zipped up, then turned to face Samson. \"Think rivers, think waterfalls.\"\n \"It won\u0027t come.\"\n \"Come on, Samson. He\u0027s coming. Relax.\"\n \"Relax? How can-\"\n \"Okay, relax in a hurry.\"\n Samson pushed until his eyes bugged. He felt a trickle, then a stream coming.\n \"Push it, Samson. He\u0027s coming.\" Billy began to back down the hill. \"Push it, man.\"\n The jeep\u0027s headlights broke over the hill and descended toward the monument. \"Duck!\" Billy said.\n Samson squatted by the base of the monument and managed to stream urine down both pant legs before he got himself reaimed. Billy dove for cover next to Samson.\n \"Did you say \u0027Duck\u0027?\" Samson whispered.\n \"Shut up,\" Billy snapped.\n Despite his fear, the adrenaline had made Samson giddy. He grinned at Billy. \"I thought you were saying \u0027Truck, which would have made more sense, but-\"\n \"Would you shut up?\" Billy risked a peek at the road. The jeep was coming toward them, rather than returning to the visitor center where it had started. As the jeep approached the monument, they worked their way around its base, keeping the obelisk between themselves and the guard. \"He won\u0027t stop, will he?\" Billy said.\n Samson could hear the jeep slowing as it passed the monument on the other side of them, not twenty feet away. They held their crouch until the jeep descended the hill and stopped halfway to the gate.\n \"He sees footprints,\" Billy said.\n \"On asphalt?\"\n \"He saw us. I\u0027m going to end up in jail like my brother.\"\n \"No, look, it\u0027s the fucking snake. He\u0027s waiting for it to get out of the road.\"\n Indeed, the guard was inching the jeep forward slowly enough for the rattler to slither off into the grass. When the snake was gone the jeep revved up and continued down the hill, by the iron gate, and back around to the back of the visitor center.\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" Billy said. They ran down the road, Samson almost falling while trying to zip his pants and run at the same time. As they reached the gate Samson grabbed Billy\u0027s shoulder and pulled him back.\n \"What the fuck?\" Billy said. Samson pointed to the chain. Billy nodded in understanding. The clanging.\n Samson went to the center of the gate and grasped it. \"Go,\" he said. \"When you get over, hold it for me.\"\n Without hesitation Billy leapt to the gate and climbed over, sliding down the opposite side instead of dropping as before. He held the gate and Samson started over.\n As Samson reached the top of the gate and was working his feet between the spearpoints, he heard Eli\u0027s laughing from down the road and he looked up. A second later he heard a metal fire door slam at the visitor center. The quick turn took his balance and he tried to jump, but one of the spearpoints caught his jeans leg and he was slammed upside down into the gate. Billy held the chain, but there was a dull clank as Samson\u0027s forehead hit the bars.\n It took Samson a second to realize that he was still hanging from the gate, his head still eight feet off the ground. \"Unhook your leg,\" Billy said. \"I\u0027ll catch you.\"\n In this position Samson was facing the visitor center. He could see some lights going on inside. He struggled to push himself up on the bar, but the spearpoint was barbed. \"I can\u0027t get it.\"\n \"Shit,\" Billy said. He held the gate with one hand and drew a flick knife from his back pocket with the other. \"I\u0027ll come up and cut you down.\"\n \"No, don\u0027t let go of the gate,\" Samson said.\n \"Fuck it,\" Billy said. He let go of the gate and it clanged with Samson\u0027s swinging weight. Billy jumped on the bars and as he climbed Samson could hear the fire door open and slam again, then footsteps. Billy stood at the top of the stone pillar and put the knife to Samson\u0027s pant leg. \"When I cut, keep hold of the bars.\"\n Billy pulled the knife blade through the denim and Samson flipped over and slammed the bars again, this time right side up. The gate clanged again. Samson heard the jeep starting and saw the beams of the headlights come out from behind the visitor center. He looked to Billy. \"Jump!\"\n Billy leapt from the fifteen-foot pillar. As he hit the pavement he yowled and crumpled. \"My ankle.\"\n Samson looked to the visitor center, where the jeep was pulling out. He grabbed Billy under the armpits and dragged him down into the ditch. They waited, breathlessly, as the jeep stopped and the guard, gun drawn, checked the lock and chain once again.\n After the guard left they crawled down the ditch toward Eli. When he came into view, Samson helped Billy to his feet and supported him while he limped up to the big Cheyenne, who was taking a deep hit on a joint.\n \"Want a hit?\" he croaked, holding the joint out to Billy.\n Billy took the joint, sat down in the grass, and took a hit.\n Eli let out a cloud of smoke and laughed. \"That was the funniest fucking thing I\u0027ve ever seen in my life.\" Then he spotted the wet streaks on Samson\u0027s pants. \"What happened, Hunts Alone? I thought you were going to piss on Custer\u0027s grave. You get so scared you wet yourself?\" He threw back his head to laugh and Samson wound up and tagged him on the jaw with a vicious roundhouse punch. Eli dropped to the ground and didn\u0027t move. Samson looked at his damaged fist, then at Eli, then at Billy Two Irons. He grinned.\n Billy said, \"You couldn\u0027t have done that twenty minutes ago and saved us all this trouble, could you?\"\n \"You\u0027re right,\" Samson said. \"I couldn\u0027t have done that twenty minutes ago. Let\u0027s get out of here before he comes to.\"\n Samson helped Billy to his feet, then out of the ditch onto the road. As they headed toward Crow Agency it seemed to get darker as they walked, then darker still, until there was no light at all and Sam was in his bedroom staring at the back of a black buckskin shirt trimmed with red woodpecker feathers.\n \"It was a stupid thing to do,\" Sam said.\n \"It was brave,\" Coyote said. \"It would have been stupid if you had failed.\"\n \"We found out later that Custer wasn\u0027t even buried there. His body was taken to West Point, so it was all for nothing.\"\n \"And what about the night on the dam? Was that all for nothing?\"\n \"How do you know about that?\"\n Coyote turned and stared at Sam with his arms crossed, his golden eyes shining with delight.\n \"That was nothing but trouble,\" Sam said finally.\n \"Would you do it again?\"\n \"Yes,\" Sam said without thinking.\n \"And the girl is nothing but trouble?\" Coyote said.\n Sam heard the words echoing in his mind. Going after the girl was the right thing to do. After all the years of doing the safe thing, it was time to do the right thing. He said, \"You really piss me off sometimes, you know that?\"\n \"Anger is the gods\u0027 way of letting you know you are alive.\"\n Sam got up and stood face-to-face with the trickster, trying to read something in his eyes. He moved forward until their noses almost touched. \"All you know is that she\u0027s going to Las Vegas? No address or anything?\"\n \"Not so far. But if she misses them there, the biker is going on to South Dakota. She\u0027ll follow. I\u0027ll tell you the rest on the way.\"\n \"I don\u0027t suppose you could change into a Learjet or something practical.\"\n Coyote shook his head. \"Just living things: animals, bugs, rocks.\"\n Sam reached into his shirt pocket, pulled out the box of breath mints, and handed them to Coyote. The trickster raised his eyebrows in query.\n Sam said, \"Eat those. I can\u0027t handle dog breath through an eight-hour drive.\"\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/coyote-blue/page-11.html","bookId":2046,"book":{"id":2046,"title":"Coyote Blue","description":"Storyline: \n This is an accelerating comedy with shadows setting off the wry, polished humor.
