{"id":109789,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"CHAPTER 8\\n\\n Meet the Muse, Mr. Lizard King\\n\\n Santa Barbara\\n\\n Calliope Kincaid waited on the steps of the Tangerine Tree Cafe thinking about the past lives of lizards. A small, brown alligator lizard was sunning himself on the planter box by the steps and his lidless eyes, glazed but seeing, reminded Calliope of a picture of Jimi Hendrix that her mother had kept next to the bed when she was growing up. She wondered if this lizard really could be an incarnation of Jimi, and what he must feel like living in the planter box in front of a cafe, eating bugs and hiding, after being a rock star.\\n\\n Between the ages of seven and nine Calliope had been raised a Hindu, and during that time she had developed an acute empathy for other creatures, never sure what bird or beast might just be Daddy or Grandma working off some karma. She had taken the concept almost to the point of agoraphobia - she was afraid to go out of the house for fear that she might crush some relative doing time as a stinkbug - when her mother moved into NSA Buddhism and Calliope\u0027s spiritual focus was changed to sitting before a gong with her mother, the two of them chanting for prosperity until the apartment\u0027s heater ducts began to vibrate. Evicted for disturbing other tenants, Calliope\u0027s mother turned to goddess worship, which Calliope liked because she didn\u0027t have to wear clothes to the rituals and there were always lots of flowers. When Calliope blossomed at thirteen and began to attract too much attention from neopagan males, her mother turned to Islam, changed her daughter\u0027s name to Akeema Mohammed Kincaid, and equipped her with a veil. Calliope, who had easily grasped the concepts of karma and reincarnation, of transcendentalism and oneness, of harmony with nature and the goddess within, was completely thrown by the concepts of guilt, self-flagellation, and modesty set down in Islam. She promptly shaved one side of her head, dyed the remainder of her waist-length blond hair hot pink, and began taking hallucinogenic drugs and sleeping with awkward, pimpled tough-boys with mohawks. Men replaced religion, and Calliope accepted their seductive lies with the same open wonder she had given the gods.\\n\\n In an attempt to pull her daughter out of a spiritual tail-spin, Mom turned Unitarian, but Calliope had already slashed the ecumenical apron strings and Mom was left to hopscotching religions on her own. Currently she lived in an ashram in Oregon where she acted as the spirit channel for a four-thousand-year-old, super-enlightened entity named Babar (no relation to the elephant).\\n\\n As a child exposed to so many religions, Calliope had developed a malleability of faith that stayed with her into adulthood. Through the assimilation of many spiritual beliefs, without science or cynicism to balance them, Calliope was able to define everything in her world, accept the highs and lows of life with resolve, and never be burdened by the need to understand. Why understand when you can believe? For Calliope, every event was mystical and every moment magical; a flat tire could be a manifestation of karma, or a lizard might be Jimi Hendrix. If she fell in love too easily and got hurt too often it wasn\u0027t bad judgment, it was just faith.\\n\\n She was humming \"Castles Made of Sand\" to the lizard when Sam\u0027s Mercedes pulled up to the curb. She looked up and smiled at him, not the least bit concerned that he was thirty minutes late. It had never occurred to her that he might not show. No man had ever stood her up.\\n\\n She ran to the car and tapped on the passenger window. Sam pushed the button and it whirred down. \"Hang on a second, I have to do something,\" she said.\\n\\n She went around to the front of the car and searched the grille until she found a moth that had met its end with minimal damage. She plucked the moth from the grille, took it to the planter box, and wiggled it in front of the lizard while singing a few bars of Hendrix\u0027s \"Little Wing.\" The lizard snapped at the moth halfheartedly and slithered away under the geraniums to sulk. Calliope had been correct in guessing that this particular lizard had, indeed, been a rock star in a previous life, and if she had sung a chorus of \"L.A. Woman\" or \"Light My Fire\" the lizard would have been delighted, but how could she have known?\\n\\n She dropped the moth into the planter box and returned to the car.\\n\\n \"Sorry I\u0027m late,\" Sam said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s only time,\" she said. \"I\u0027m always late.\"\\n\\n \"I had them fix your car.\" He was trying not to look at her. He\u0027d just gotten enough control of his nerves to drive and he wasn\u0027t ready to be rattled by the girl again, but he wouldn\u0027t have thought of not picking her up. During the whole debacle at the condo, the urgency to see her again had hovered in the background of his mind and finally snapped him out of his confusion over the Coyote medicine. Was she connected to the Indian?\\n\\n \"That\u0027s sweet of you,\" she said. \"Did you look at the car?\"\\n\\n \"Look at it? No. I just had the garage come down.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a great car,\" Calliope said. \"It has over three hundred horsepower, a six-pack of Weber carburetors, competition suspension and gearing - it\u0027ll do over a hundred and eighty on a straightaway. I can blow most Porsches off the road.\"\\n\\n Sam didn\u0027t know what to say, so he said, \"That\u0027s nice.\"\\n\\n \"I know that women aren\u0027t supposed to care about things like that. My mother says that I\u0027m obsessed with vehicles because I was conceived in the back of a VW microbus and spent most of my childhood in one. We moved around a lot.\"\\n\\n \"Where does she live?\" Sam asked. He would ask her about the Indian, really, when the time was right.\\n\\n \"Oregon. I didn\u0027t build the car myself. I used to live with this sculptor in Sedona, Arizona, who built it for midnight drives in the desert. One day I was telling him that I thought that cars had replaced guns as phallic symbols for American men, and I thought it was interesting that he had one that was so small and fast. The next day he gave me the Datsun and went out and bought a Lincoln. It was very sweet.\"\\n\\n \"Very sweet,\" Sam echoed. Now or never, he thought. \"Calliope - that is your name, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" the girl said.\\n\\n Sam put on his salesman\u0027s this is a serious matter voice. \"Calliope, do you know who the-\"\\n\\n \"My name wasn\u0027t always Calliope,\" she interrupted. \"Sherman - he was the sculptor - started calling me Calliope, after the Greek muse of epic poetry. He said that I inspired men to art and madness. I liked the way it sounded so I took it as my real name. My mom even calls me Calliope now.\"\\n\\n Sam had brought thousands of sales interviews back into control when the client tried to wander, he wouldn\u0027t let this girl sidetrack him. \"Calliope, who was the Indian-\"\\n\\n \"You know, the Indians used to change their names as they grew up and their personalities changed or when they did certain things, like Walks Across the Desert and stuff like that. Did you know that?\"\\n\\n \"No I didn\u0027t,\" Sam lied. \"But I really need to know-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, there\u0027s my car!\"\\n\\n Sam slowed and pulled the Mercedes in behind the Z. \"Calliope, before you go-\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t have sex tonight,\" she said. \"I have some things to do, but I can cook you dinner tomorrow if you want.\"\\n\\n Sam turned to her, his mouth hanging open. She was smiling at him, waiting for his answer with her eyes wide, as if she\u0027d just been surprised. He realized that every time he had looked at her she\u0027d worn that same expression of wonderment, and each time it had thrown him. Dammit, he wouldn\u0027t be distracted. She was sharp, but he was sharper. He was in control here.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Terrific. I live at seventeen and a half Anapamu Street - that\u0027s upstairs. Whatever you do, don\u0027t go to the downstairs door. Six o\u0027clock, okay?\" Without waiting for his answer, she was out of the car and away.\\n\\n Sam rolled down the window and shouted after her. \"My name is Sam.\"\\n\\n She looked back at him and smiled, then got into the Datsun and fired it up. Sam watched the little sports car tilt with the torque of the engine as she revved it. She burned off the back tires, filling the air with squeals and blue smoke as she pulled away.\\n\\n CHAPTER 9\\n\\n Quitting Now Greatly Reduces the Chance of Visions\\n\\n Crow Country - 1967\\n\\n It was well before dawn and no lights burned in the houses and shops of Crow Agency as Pokey piloted his old truck through town, a sleepy-eyed Samson wobbling on the seat next to him.\\n\\n \"How far is it to the fasting place?\" Samson asked.\\n\\n \"About two hours, but only fifty or so miles as the Crow drives. Get it, as the Crow drives?\" Pokey grinned at Samson and took a swig from a pint bottle of whiskey. He and Harlan had talked and drunk all night after Samson\u0027s sweat. Now he was using the road like a buttered harlot - he was all over the place while trying to stay in the middle - and scaring Samson, whose head whacked the window when Pokey got too much shoulder and had to yank the truck\u0027s retreads back onto the asphalt.\\n\\n \"Could we slow down, Pokey?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not going that fast.\"\\n\\n Samson peeked at the speedometer, which registered zero, as did all the broken gauges in the truck. Pokey caught Samson looking and grinned again.\\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t in any danger at all, you know. I seen my death in a medicine dream. I get shot, and it ain\u0027t nowhere near this old truck. Nope, I\u0027m plumb safe in this truck, no matter what I do.\"\\n\\n \"What about me?\" Samson asked.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know? What\u0027s your death dream?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t have one.\"\\n\\n Pokey looked down at Samson with a worried expression. \"You didn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"Nope,\" Samson said with a gulp.\\n\\n \"Well then, if I wreck you could be plumb fucked.\" He began to weave more radically, leaning hard into Samson as the truck slipped off the shoulder again. \"Oh, shit! These tires are bald too! Don\u0027t worry, son, I\u0027ll dance for your ghost at the Sun Dance!\"\\n\\n \"Pokey, stop it!\" Samson had begun to giggle as his uncle leaned into him.\\n\\n \"Quick, go to sleep fast, and dream of dying on top of a pretty woman, Samson. It\u0027s your only chance.\"\\n\\n \"Pokey!\" Samson was doubled over with laughter now as Pokey fishtailed the truck back and forth in the road while pumping the brakes and the clutch, causing Samson\u0027s head to jerk around like a rag doll\u0027s.\\n\\n Pokey shouted, \"Blacken your face, Samson Hunts Alone, this is a good day to die.\" Then he slammed on the brakes and brought the truck to a skidding stop in the middle, of the road. Samson was thrown to the floor of the truck among a collection of old beer cans and soda bottles. Still giggling, he climbed back up onto the seat and began pounding on Pokey\u0027s shoulder. Pokey grabbed his hands and shushed him.\\n\\n \"Look,\" Pokey said, nodding to the front of the truck. Samson turned to see a huge buffalo bull crossing the road in front of them.\\n\\n \"Where did he come from?\" Samson asked as he watched the bull lumber out of the headlights.\\n\\n \"Must of wandered off the Yellowtail\u0027s place. They got a few head of buffalo.\"\\n\\n \"Good thing you saw him in time.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t see him. Them things are so dark they just eat up your headlights. I was just fooling with you when I stopped.\"\\n\\n \"We were lucky,\" Samson said gravely.\\n\\n \"Nope, I told you we was safe. Now you quit being afraid of things that ain\u0027t happened yet. That\u0027s why I gave you that dream.\"\\n\\n Pokey geared up the truck and they rode in silence for a while, listening to the rattling grind of the old Ford\u0027s engine. The sky was just getting light and Samson could see the new leaves coming on the trees and the blossoms on the cotton-woods. He was glad his fast was to be in the time of the first grass. The days would be mild and warm, but not hot.\\n\\n \"Pokey,\" Samson said. \"What do I do when I get thirsty?\"\\n\\n Pokey took a long pull on the pint before he answered. \"You must pray that your suffering is accepted and you are given a spirit helper.\"\\n\\n \"But what do I do? What if I die?\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t die. When your suffering is too much you must go to the Spirit World. You must see yourself traveling into a hole in the ground and down a long tunnel. You will come out into the light and you will be in the Spirit World. There you will not be hungry or thirsty. Wait there and your spirit helper will come to you.\"\\n\\n \"What if my spirit helper doesn\u0027t come?\"\\n\\n \"You must go back down the tunnel again and again, looking for him. In the buffalo days you had to have a spirit helper to go into battle or people thought you were a Crazy Dog Wishing to Die.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"A warrior who is so crazy, or so full of sadness, that he rides against the enemy just so they will kill him.\"\\n\\n \"Was my dad a Crazy Dog Wishing to Die?\"\\n\\n Pokey smiled and looked wistfully ahead. \"It is bad luck to speak of it, but no, he did not wish to die. He just got too drunk and drove too fast after his basketball games.\"\\n\\n They drove south through Lodge Grass, where the only activity was that of a few dogs trying to clear their throats for the day\u0027s barking and a few ranchers cadging free coffee at the feed and grain store. Once through town, Pokey turned east on a dirt road into the rising sun to the Wolf Mountains. In the foothills the road became deeply rutted, and washed out in places. Pokey shifted into low and the truck ground down to a crawl. After a half hour of kidney-jarring bumps and vertiginous cutbacks, Pokey stopped the truck on a high ridge between the peaks of two mountains.\\n\\n From here Samson could see all the way to Lodge Grass to the west, and across the green prairies of the Northern Cheyenne reservation to the east. Lodgepole pines lined the mountain on both sides, as thick as feathers on a bird, thinning here, near the peak, where the ground was arid, strewn with giant boulders, and barren but for a few yucca plants and the odd tuft of buffalo grass or sage.\\n\\n \"There.\" Pokey pointed east to a group of car-sized boulders about fifty yards from the road. \"That is the place where you will fast. I\u0027ll wait for you on this side of the road if you need me, but you must only come up here if you have a vision or if you are in trouble.\" Pokey grabbed a bag from the floor of the truck and handed it to Samson through the window. \"There\u0027s a blanket in there and some mint leaves to chew when you get thirsty. Go now. I will pray for your success.\"\\n\\n As he walked down the hill toward the boulders, Samson felt a lump rising in his throat. What good is medicine if you die of thirst? What good is medicine, anyway? He\u0027d rather be in school. This was no fun, this was scary. Why did Pokey have to be so strange? Why couldn\u0027t he be more like Harlan, or Ben Cartwright?\\n\\n Once on the downhill side of the boulders Samson could see the place where he would sit through his fast: a small stone fire ring under the overhang of one of the boulders. Samson sat down facing the sun, which was now a great orange ball on the eastern horizon.\\n\\n He thought of Grandma at home. She would be pouring Lucky Charms in everyone\u0027s bowls about now, getting his little cousin Alice\u0027s insulin out of the refrigerator and filling the syringe, making sure everyone was dressed and ready for school. Uncle Harlan would be sitting in the living room drinking coffee and telling all the kids to be quiet because of his hangover. Samson\u0027s aunts would be pulling the blankets off the sweat lodge and loading them into the back of Harlan\u0027s truck so they could take them to the laundromat. Normally, Samson would be trading punches in the arm with Harry and Festus and lying to Grandma about having his homework done. He wanted to be at home with everyone else, not sitting by himself up here on a mountain. He had never been by himself before. He decided he didn\u0027t like it. For the first time in his life he was lonely.\\n\\n He tried to think of the Spirit World. Maybe he could go there really fast, find a spirit helper and go back up to the truck so Pokey could take him to Lodge Grass and get a Coke: thirty minutes, tops. Get in, get out, and nobody gets hurt, as Uncle Harlan always said, something he picked up in Vietnam.\\n\\n Samson tried to imagine the hole he would enter the Spirit World through. He couldn\u0027t do it. Maybe a prayer.\\n\\n \"O Great Spirit and Great Mother,\" Samson prayed in Crow. \"Hear my prayer. Please let me find my spirit helper so I can go home.\"\\n\\n He waited a moment. Okay, that didn\u0027t work, back to the hole in the ground.\\n\\n After two hours he grew bored and his mind wandered to the Ponderosa, then to school, home, the planet Krypton, the snack bar in Crow Agency, the McDonald\u0027s in Billings, the damp basement of Lodge Grass High School, where Harlan had taken him and shown him old black-and-white films of his father playing basketball. He wondered what his father had been like. Then wondered about his mother, who had died when he was only two. Her liver quit, Harlan said. No one else would talk about the dead. He tried to remember her, but could remember only Grandma and his aunts. The new feeling of loneliness was getting worse.\\n\\n Maybe he could make up a vision. He could go tell Pokey that he had a vision and found his spirit helper and Pokey would tell him how to make his medicine bundle and he could go home. That would work. He thought for a moment about what animal he should pick for his spirit helper and decided on a hawk. He didn\u0027t know what hawk medicine was, but it was probably pretty good for you unless you raised chickens or something.\\n\\n Samson ran up the hill and just as he was cresting the ridge he began to shout. \"Pokey! Pokey! I had my vision! I saw my spirit helper!\" When he reached the road the truck was nowhere in sight. He looked up and down the road, then crossed it and looked down the other side of the ridge. Pokey was gone.\\n\\n Samson felt his lip begin to quiver and water fill his eyes. He sat down in the dirt as the first series of chest-wrenching sobs escaped him and echoed down the ridge. He buried his face in his knees and cried until his throat hurt. When finally he found the bottom of his sadness he looked up and wiped his eyes on his forearm.\\n\\n Why would Pokey just leave him? Maybe he just went to buy some beer. Maybe he would bring back a Coke. Samson suddenly realized that he really was thirsty. The sun was moving higher in the sky and it was starting to get hot. He stood and looked around for a shady place to wait, but the closest shade was down by the boulders, and from there he wouldn\u0027t be able to see the truck coming. He sat on a small rock by the road in the full sun.\\n\\n During the next two hours Samson chewed all his mint leaves and took to sucking pebbles to keep his mouth from getting dry while he drew pictures in the dust with a stick. He heard a car engine and looked up to see a cloud of dust coming off the road about two miles away. That would be Pokey.\\n\\n Samson stood on the rock to see if he could make out the truck. As the cloud approached, however, he noticed that it wasn\u0027t Pokey\u0027s truck at all, but a big powder-blue car unlike any he had seen before. He sat back down on the rock and was fighting back another fit of sobs when the car skidded to a stop beside him, bringing with it a choking cloud of dust. There was a whirring sound and the car window slid down, revealing the big, round face of the driver, a white man, who seemed to have four or five spare chins under his first one.\\n\\n \"Excuse me, son.\" The driver smiled. \"I seem to have gotten myself turned around here. Would you know the way to get to Highway Ninety?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a long way,\" Samson said. \"You have to go down the mountain into Lodge Grass, then go to Crow Agency. That\u0027s where the highway is.\" The white man wasn\u0027t really white, he was more of a bright pink, and he smiled with his voice, like Samson was his best friend.\\n\\n \"You lost me, son. Lodge Grass?\"\\n\\n \"You have to stay on this road down the mountain, then you have to turn.\"\\n\\n \"I got you there, son, but which way did you say I should turn?\"\\n\\n Samson pointed down the mountain and the driver\u0027s eyes followed his finger, then he turned back to Samson looking confused. \"I don\u0027t suppose you are heading that way, are you, son?\"\\n\\n Samson thought for a minute before he answered. If this man would take him to the highway in Crow Agency he could walk home from there. Never trust a white man who wants to give you something, Pokey had said. Soon as you think you got it he will take it away and take everything you got along with it. But Samson couldn\u0027t figure out how the driver would take away a ride, and all he really owned was his hunting knife. If the white man tried to take that, Samson would cut his gizzard out. \"I\u0027m going to Crow Agency,\" the boy said. \"I can show you the way.\"\\n\\n \"Well, jump in quick, partner. It\u0027s hotter than blazes out here and it\u0027s gettin\u0027 in the car.\"\\n\\n Samson walked around the back of the car, remembering what Pokey had told him about not trusting white men. It was the biggest, bluest car he had ever seen. Maybe it was the heat, but it seemed to take a long time to walk around it. When he opened the door a blast of cold air hit him that instantly brought goose bumps to his arms and back: He jumped into the car and stared in amazement at the vents in the dashboard where the cold was coming from. He\u0027d never experienced air-conditioning before.\\n\\n \"Close the door, son. You want to bake us?\"\\n\\n Samson closed the door as the car started moving. \"It\u0027s cool in here, and it smells good.\"\\n\\n The driver, still smiling, looked down at Samson and tipped the straw skimmer he was wearing. He was the fattest man Samson had ever seen and he was wearing a powder-blue suit the same shade as the car; he filled the driver\u0027s seat like a bagful of sky. Up close Samson could see that the man\u0027s skin was pink from little veins that ran through it like road maps.\\n\\n \"Thank you kindly, son. Name\u0027s Commerce. Lloyd Commerce, purveyor of the world\u0027s finest cleaning apparatus, the Miracle.\"\\n\\n He held out a fat hand to Samson. Samson shook two of the giant fingers with his right hand. He let his left drop near the handle of his hunting knife. \"I don\u0027t know what that is,\" Samson said. \"I\u0027m Samson Hunts Alone.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know about the Miracle? Well, Samson Hunts Alone, let me tell you: in a few years the Miracle will be the standard by which all vacuum cleaners will die. In a few years, if you don\u0027t have a Miracle in your broom closet you might as well just hang a sign outside your house saying \u0027We live in filth. The Miracle is just the most advanced machine for the elimination of household dirt, dust, and disease that the world has ever known!\"\\n\\n Samson was amazed at how excited Lloyd was - it seemed that the more Lloyd talked, the pinker he got. Even if it was rude, Samson thought he should interrupt before Lloyd hurt himself. \"I know what a miracle is. One of my aunts is a Christian. I don\u0027t know what a purveyor is.\"\\n\\n Lloyd took a deep breath and shot a smile at Samson. \"I am a salesman, son, one of the last truly free individuals on this planet. I sell miracles, son. Not just vacuum cleaners. I sell real loaves-and-fishes miracles.\" He paused for a moment and waited. Samson was hugging the car door, his hand on his knife thinking that this was the craziest talk he had ever heard from anyone besides Pokey.\\n\\n \"I know what you\u0027re thinking,\" Lloyd continued. \"You\u0027re thinking, Lloyd, what kind of miracle do you perform? Am I right?\"\\n\\n \"Nope,\" Samson said. \"I was thinking about a Coke.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s some in a cooler in the backseat,\" Lloyd tossed off, trying to get back to his point. \"Grab me one too, would you, son?\"\\n\\n Samson scrambled over the seat and dug into a cooler where a dozen Cokes lay in the ice around a fifth of rum. He grabbed two and slithered back over the seat. Lloyd took the Cokes and opened them. He handed one to Samson, who drank half the bottle in one pull.\\n\\n \"Miracles,\" Lloyd said.\\n\\n Samson didn\u0027t care how crazy Lloyd was - life was fine! The car was cool and quiet and smelled like spices. He wasn\u0027t thirsty and he was going home. Even on the rough mountain road the car rode like a cloud. He closed one eye and rested, keeping the other eye on Lloyd. \"Miracles?\" Samson said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right! I can make dreams out of nothing, wants out of dreams, needs out of wants, and leave a dream in your hand. You know how I do it?\"\\n\\n Samson shook his head. This man was just like Pokey: if he wanted to tell you something he would tell you even if you dropped dead and rotted right before his eyes.\\n\\n \"Well, son, it all starts with a smile at the door. When you hit that door people ain\u0027t been sitting there waiting for you. They been sitting around thinking about how miserable they are. They got nothing to hang on to, nothing to go on for. When they answer that door they\u0027re as sour as green oranges, but I don\u0027t give it back to \u0027em. I give a smile of pure honey, and words just as sweet. I tell them what they want to hear. If they\u0027re ugly, I tell \u0027em they\u0027re looking fine. If they\u0027re a failure, I marvel at their success. Before they got the latch off the screen door I\u0027m the best friend they ever had. And why? Because I see them as what they would like to be, not what they are. For once in their life they are living their dream, only because I make them think they are.\\n\\n \"But then they look around and get a little uncomfortable. If they got what they wanted, how come they ain\u0027t feeling it? How come they still feel empty? Well, son, between you and me, there ain\u0027t no contentment, no satisfaction, this side of the grave. You ain\u0027t never going to be as pretty or as rich as you want to be. No one ever has, no one ever will. Folks don\u0027t know that, though. Folks think that there\u0027s an answer to that scary feeling that keeps riding them no matter what they do.\"\\n\\n \"Coyote Blue,\" Samson said.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t talk nonsense, boy, I\u0027m trying to teach you something. Where was I? Oh, yeah, they think that there\u0027s an answer. So I give it to them. I watch their eyes while I\u0027m telling them how damn good they\u0027re doing, and when they get right to the edge of panic \u0027cause they can\u0027t see it, I tell them about the Miracle.\\n\\n \"Suddenly a clean rug is all that stands between them and all they could ever be. I take out my machine, and I vacuum up their beds into a little black bag. Then I have them boil that bag on the stove until the whole house smells like a sun-ripe battlefield. You see, all that dead skin that falls off you in your sleep is in the mattress; when you boil it the smell is disgusting. There is filth in these folks\u0027 houses. How the hell you gonna be beautiful and successful with filth all around? You can\u0027t. Filth is the problem and the Miracle is the solution. Now they want it.\\n\\n \"So we talk some more and I make like I\u0027m gonna leave, but they want the machine. I understand that, but they already got a vacuum cleaner. They don\u0027t need my machine. I guess a little filth never hurt no one. But they do need it, they say. They need it. And why do they need it? Because now it\u0027s all they got standing between them and their dream. So I write them up. I take their money and I leave them holding that dream in their hand while I drive away. Wants, to needs, to dreams - usually in forty-five minutes or less. Now that\u0027s a damn miracle, son.\"\\n\\n \"So you trick them,\" Samson said.\\n\\n \"They want to be tricked. I just provide a service. It ain\u0027t no different than going to the movies or seeing a magician. You don\u0027t want to see that the pirates are using rubber swords, do you? You don\u0027t want to see the secret pockets up the magician\u0027s sleeves, do you? You want to believe in something that you know ain\u0027t true, just for a while. People spend a lot of money and time to get tricked. And I get to drive a nice car, stay in good motels, eat in restaurants, and see the country in style.\"\\n\\n Samson thought about that for a while. Driving around in a big, cool, good-smelling car would be almost as good as living on the Ponderosa. Maybe better. Nobody on the reservation drove a car like this, and they hardly ever ate in restaurants, except the burger stand in Crow Agency. Maybe tricking people was the way to go. It sure sounded better than baling hay or fixing truck engines.\\n\\n \"Do you think I could sell miracles?\" Samson asked.\\n\\n Lloyd laughed. \"You got some growing to do first. Besides, it takes a man of character to handle freedom. Do you have character, Samson?\"\\n\\n \"Is that like medicine?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s better than medicine. You get yourself some character and come see me in a few years. Then we\u0027ll see.\"\\n\\n That settled it. Samson was going to get himself some character and sell himself some miracles. He lay back on the seat and closed his eyes. Lloyd started talking again. The words were soft and rhythmic and soon Samson Hunts Alone, full of Coca-Cola and miracles, fell asleep.\\n\\n -\u003d*\u003d-\\n\\n \"Samson, wake up.\"\\n\\n Someone was shaking his shoulders. He opened his eyes and saw Pokey holding him at arm\u0027s length.\\n\\n \"What are you doing up here by the road?\" Pokey asked.\\n\\n \"What?\" Samson looked around. He was on the ridge where he had sat down before the big blue car had come along. \"Where\u0027s Lloyd?\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s Lloyd?\" Pokey asked. \"I\u0027ve only been gone a couple of hours. Why did you come up here? Did you have your vision?\"\\n\\n \"No, I went for a ride. I took a ride home with a man who sold Miracles.\"\\n\\n \"Samson,\" Pokey said. \"I don\u0027t think you took a ride anywhere. I think you better tell me what the man said to you.\"\\n\\n Samson told Pokey about Lloyd Commerce, about the car as long as a house, about selling miracles and tricking people and living the good life. When he was finished Pokey sat staring at the boy for a long time before he spoke. \"Samson, you had your vision. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you sorry, Pokey? Because I didn\u0027t find my spirit helper?\"\\n\\n \"I wish you saw a squirrel or a flicker, Samson, but you saw a vacuum cleaner salesman,\" Pokey said forlornly.\\n\\n \"But he was just a fat white man.\"\\n\\n \"He only looked like a white man. I think you saw Old Man Coyote.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/coyote-blue/page-4.html","bookId":2046,"book":{"id":2046,"title":"Coyote Blue","description":"Storyline: This is an accelerating comedy with shadows setting off the wry, polished humor. Trickster deities thrive on contrariety, which is why one finds them bringing life into dead landscapes and disorder into order. A Santa Barbara insurance salesman\u0027s too-tidily-contained lifestyle, far from the Crow reservation he grew up on, is an irresistible target for Coyote, who wants to make sure his chosen people don\u0027t forget him. Coyote descends on Sam Hunter like one of Job\u0027s plagues, albeit a charmingly disingenuous one. \"Why me? Why not someone who believes?\" asks Sam, suffering from god-induced chaos. \"This is more fun,\" says Coyote. He\u0027s right.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/coyote-blue.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/coyote-blue.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:42:53 PM"}}
