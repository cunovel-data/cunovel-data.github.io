And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. \n [bbe] Then Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the agreement and go over in front of the people. So they took up the ark of the agreement and went in front of the people. \n 3:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 约 书 亚 说 ， 从 今 日 起 ， 我 必 使 你 在 以 色 列 众 人 眼 前 尊 大 ， 使 他 们 知 道 我 怎 样 与 摩 西 同 在 ， 也 必 照 样 与 你 同 在 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Joshua, From now on I will give you glory in the eyes of all Israel, so that they may see that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. \n 3:8 [hgb] 你 要 吩 咐 抬 约 柜 的 祭 司 说 ， 你 们 到 了 约 旦 河 的 水 边 上 ， 就 要 在 约 旦 河 水 里 站 住 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. \n [bbe] And you are to give orders to the priests who take up the ark of the agreement, and say, When you come to the edge of the waters of Jordan, go no further. \n 3:9 [hgb] 约 书 亚 对 以 色 列 人 说 ， 你 们 近 前 来 ， 听 耶 和 华 你 们 神 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God. \n [bbe] And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come to me here: and give ear to the words of the Lord your God. \n 3:10 [hgb] 约 书 亚 说 ， 看 哪 ， 普 天 下 主 的 约 柜 必 在 你 们 前 头 过 去 ， 到 约 旦 河 里 ， 因 此 你 们 就 知 道 在 你 们 中 间 有 永 生 神 。 并 且 他 必 在 你 们 面 前 赶 出 迦 南 人 ， 赫 人 ， 希 未 人 ， 比 利 洗 人 ， 革 迦 撒 人 ， 亚 摩 利 人 ， 耶 布 斯 人 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. \n [bbe] And Joshua said, By this you will see that the living God is among you, and that he will certainly send out from before you the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite. \n 3:11 [hgb] \n [kjv] Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan. \n [bbe] See, the ark of the agreement of the Lord of all the earth is going over before you into Jordan. \n 3:12 [hgb] 你 们 现 在 要 从 以 色 列 支 派 中 拣 选 十 二 个 人 ， 每 支 派 一 人 ， \n [kjv] Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man. \n [bbe] So take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, a man from every tribe. \n 3:13 [hgb] 等 到 抬 普 天 下 主 耶 和 华 约 柜 的 祭 司 把 脚 站 在 约 旦 河 水 里 ， 约 旦 河 的 水 ， 就 是 从 上 往 下 流 的 水 ， 必 然 断 绝 ， 立 起 成 垒 。 \n [kjv] And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap. \n [bbe] And when the feet of the priests who take up the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of Jordan, the waters of Jordan will be cut off, all the waters flowing down from higher up, and will come together in a mass. \n 3:14 [hgb] 百 姓 离 开 帐 棚 要 过 约 旦 河 的 时 候 ， 抬 约 柜 的 祭 司 乃 在 百 姓 的 前 头 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people; \n [bbe] So when the people went out from their tents to go over Jordan, the priests who took up the ark of the agreement were in front of the people; \n 3:15 [hgb] 他 们 到 了 约 旦 河 ， 脚 一 入 水 （ 原 来 约 旦 河 水 在 收 割 的 日 子 涨 过 两 岸 ） ， \n [kjv] And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,) \n [bbe] And when those who took up the ark came to Jordan, and the feet of the priests who took up the ark were touching the edge of the water (for the waters of Jordan are overflowing all through the time of the grain-cutting), \n 3:16 [hgb] 那 从 上 往 下 流 的 水 便 在 极 远 之 地 ， 撒 拉 但 旁 的 亚 当 城 那 里 停 住 ， 立 起 成 垒 。 那 往 亚 拉 巴 的 海 ， 就 是 盐 海 ， 下 流 的 水 全 然 断 绝 。 于 是 百 姓 在 耶 利 哥 的 对 面 过 去 了 。 \n [kjv] That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. \n [bbe] Then the waters flowing down from higher up were stopped and came together in a mass a long way back at Adam, a town near Zarethan; and the waters flowing down to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were cut off: and the people went across opposite Jericho. \n 3:17 [hgb] 抬 耶 和 华 约 柜 的 祭 司 在 约 旦 河 中 的 干 地 上 站 定 ， 以 色 列 众 人 都 从 干 地 上 过 去 ， 直 到 国 民 尽 都 过 了 约 旦 河 。 \n [kjv] And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan. \n [bbe] And the priests who took up the ark of the agreement of the Lord kept their places, with their feet on dry land in the middle of Jordan, while all Israel went over on dry land, till all the nation had gone over Jordan. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21/344.html","bookId":239,"book":{"id":239,"title":"Joshua约书亚记(双语小说)","description":"简介： Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses\u0027 minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead;
