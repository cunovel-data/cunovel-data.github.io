and they presented themselves before God. \n [bbe] Then Joshua got all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem; and he sent for the responsible men of Israel and their chiefs and their judges and their overseers; and they took their place before God. \n 24:2 [hgb] 约 书 亚 对 众 民 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 古 时 你 们 的 列 祖 ， 就 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 和 拿 鹤 的 父 亲 他 拉 ， 住 在 大 河 那 边 事 奉 别 神 ， \n [kjv] And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods. \n [bbe] And Joshua said to all the people, These are the words of the Lord, the God of Israel: In the past your fathers, Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor, were living on the other side of the River: and they were worshipping other gods. \n 24:3 [hgb] 我 将 你 们 的 祖 宗 亚 伯 拉 罕 从 大 河 那 边 带 来 ， 领 他 走 遍 迦 南 全 地 ， 又 使 他 的 子 孙 众 多 ， 把 以 撒 赐 给 他 。 \n [kjv] And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. \n [bbe] And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River, guiding him through all the land of Canaan; I made his offspring great in number, and gave him Isaac. \n 24:4 [hgb] 又 把 雅 各 和 以 扫 赐 给 以 撒 ， 将 西 珥 山 赐 给 以 扫 为 业 。 后 来 雅 各 和 他 的 子 孙 下 到 埃 及 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. \n [bbe] And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau: to Esau I gave Mount Seir, as his heritage; but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. \n 24:5 [hgb] 我 差 遣 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 ， 并 照 我 在 埃 及 中 所 行 的 降 灾 与 埃 及 ， 然 后 把 你 们 领 出 来 。 \n [kjv] I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. \n [bbe] And I sent Moses and Aaron, troubling Egypt by all the signs I did among them: and after that I took you out. \n 24:6 [hgb] 我 领 你 们 列 祖 出 埃 及 ， 他 们 就 到 了 红 海 。 埃 及 人 带 领 车 辆 马 兵 追 赶 你 们 列 祖 到 红 海 。 \n [kjv] And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea. \n [bbe] I took your fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the Red Sea; and the Egyptians came after your fathers to the Red Sea, with their war-carriages and their horsemen. \n 24:7 [hgb] 你 们 列 祖 哀 求 耶 和 华 ， 他 就 使 你 们 和 埃 及 人 中 间 黑 暗 了 ， 又 使 海 水 淹 没 埃 及 人 。 我 在 埃 及 所 行 的 事 ， 你 们 亲 眼 见 过 。 你 们 在 旷 野 也 住 了 许 多 年 日 。 \n [kjv] And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season. \n [bbe] And at their cry, the Lord made it dark between you and the Egyptians, and made the sea go over them, covering them with its waters; your eyes have seen what I did in Egypt: then for a long time you were living in the waste land. \n 24:8 [hgb] 我 领 你 们 到 约 旦 河 东 亚 摩 利 人 所 住 之 地 。 他 们 与 你 们 争 战 ， 我 将 他 们 交 在 你 们 手 中 ， 你 们 便 得 了 他 们 的 地 为 业 。 我 也 在 你 们 面 前 将 他 们 灭 绝 。 \n [kjv] And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you. \n [bbe] And I took you into the lands of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan; and they made war on you, and I gave them into your hands and you took their land; and I sent destruction on them before you. \n 24:9 [hgb] 那 时 ， 摩 押 王 西 拨 的 儿 子 巴 勒 起 来 攻 击 以 色 列 人 ， 打 发 人 召 了 比 珥 的 儿 子 巴 兰 来 咒 诅 你 们 。 \n [kjv] Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you: \n [bbe] Then Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab, went up to war against Israel; and he sent for Balaam, the son of Beor, to put a curse on you: \n 24:10 [hgb] 我 不 肯 听 巴 兰 的 话 ， 所 以 他 倒 为 你 们 连 连 祝 福 。 这 样 ， 我 便 救 你 们 脱 离 巴 勒 的 手 。 \n [kjv] But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand. \n [bbe] But I did not give ear to Balaam; and so he went on blessing you; and I kept you safe from him. \n 24:11 [hgb] 你 们 过 了 约 旦 河 ， 到 了 耶 利 哥 。 耶 利 哥 人 ， 亚 摩 利 人 ， 比 利 洗 人 ， 迦 南 人 ， 赫 人 ， 革 迦 撒 人 ， 希 未 人 ， 耶 布 斯 人 都 与 你 们 争 战 。 我 把 他 们 交 在 你 们 手 里 。 \n [kjv] And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand. \n [bbe] Then you went over Jordan and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho made war on you, the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Hivites and the Jebusites: and I gave them up into your hands. \n 24:12 [hgb] 我 打 发 黄 蜂 飞 在 你 们 前 面 ， 将 亚 摩 利 人 的 二 王 从 你 们 面 前 撵 出 ， 并 不 是 用 你 的 刀 ， 也 不 是 用 你 的 弓 。 \n [kjv] And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. \n [bbe] And I sent the hornet before you, driving out the two kings of the Amorites before you, not with your sword and your bow. \n 24:13 [hgb] 我 赐 给 你 们 地 土 ， 非 你 们 所 修 治 的 。 我 赐 给 你 们 城 邑 ， 非 你 们 所 建 造 的 。 你 们 就 住 在 其 中 ， 又 得 吃 非 你 们 所 栽 种 的 葡 萄 园 ， 橄 榄 园 的 果 子 。 \n [kjv] And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. \n [bbe] And I gave you a land on which you had done no work, and towns not of your building, and you are now living in them; and your food comes from vine-gardens and olive-gardens not of your planting. \n 24:14 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 要 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 诚 心 实 意 地 事 奉 他 ， 将 你 们 列 祖 在 大 河 那 边 和 在 埃 及 所 事 奉 的 神 除 掉 ， 去 事 奉 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD. \n [bbe] So now, go in fear of the Lord, and be his servants with true hearts: put away the gods worshipped by your fathers across the River and in Egypt, and be servants of the Lord. \n 24:15 [hgb] 若 是 你 们 以 事 奉 耶 和 华 为 不 好 ， 今 日 就 可 以 选 择 所 要 事 奉 的 ， 是 你 们 列 祖 在 大 河 那 边 所 事 奉 的 神 呢 ？ 是 你 们 所 住 这 地 的 亚 摩 利 人 的 神 呢 ？ 至 于 我 和 我 家 ， 我 们 必 定 事 奉 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. \n [bbe] And if it seems evil to you to be the servants of the Lord, make the decision this day whose servants you will be: of the gods whose servants your fathers were across the River, or of the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living: but I and my house will be the servants of the Lord. \n 24:16 [hgb] 百 姓 回 答 说 ， 我 们 断 不 敢 离 弃 耶 和 华 去 事 奉 别 神 。 \n [kjv] And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods; \n [bbe] Then the people in answer said, Never will we give up the Lord to be the servants of other gods; \n 24:17 [hgb] 因 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 曾 将 我 们 和 我 们 列 祖 从 埃 及 地 的 为 奴 之 家 领 出 来 ， 在 我 们 眼 前 行 了 那 些 大 神 迹 ， 在 我 们 所 行 的 道 上 ， 所 经 过 的 诸 国 ， 都 保 护 了 我 们 。 \n [kjv] For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed: \n [bbe] For it is the Lord our God who has taken us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house, and who did all those great signs before our eyes, and kept us safe on all our journeys, and among all the peoples through whom we went: \n 24:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 把 住 此 地 的 亚 摩 利 人 都 从 我 们 面 前 赶 出 去 。 所 以 ， 我 们 必 事 奉 耶 和 华 ， 因 为 他 是 我 们 的 神 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God. \n [bbe] And the Lord sent out from before us all the peoples, the Amorites living in the land: so we will be the servants of the Lord, for he is our God. \n 24:19 [hgb] 约 书 亚 对 百 姓 说 ， 你 们 不 能 事 奉 耶 和 华 。 因 为 他 是 圣 洁 的 神 ， 是 忌 邪 的 神 ， 必 不 赦 免 你 们 的 过 犯 罪 恶 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins. \n [bbe] And Joshua said to the people, You are not able to be the servants of the Lord, for he is a holy God, a God who will not let his honour be given to another: he will have no mercy on your wrongdoing or your sins. \n 24:20 [hgb] 你 们 若 离 弃 耶 和 华 去 事 奉 外 邦 神 ， 耶 和 华 在 降 福 之 后 ， 必 转 而 降 祸 与 你 们 ， 把 你 们 灭 绝 。 \n [kjv] If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good. \n [bbe] If you are turned away from the Lord and become the servants of strange gods, then turning against you he will do you evil, cutting you off, after he has done you good. \n 24:21 [hgb] 百 姓 回 答 约 书 亚 说 ， 不 然 ， 我 们 定 要 事 奉 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD. \n [bbe] And the people said to Joshua, No! But we will be the servants of the Lord. \n 24:22 [hgb] 约 书 亚 对 百 姓 说 ， 你 们 选 定 耶 和 华 ， 要 事 奉 他 ， 你 们 自 己 作 见 证 吧 。 他 们 说 ， 我 们 愿 意 作 见 证 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses. \n [bbe] And Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have made the decision to be the servants of the Lord. And they said, We are witnesses. \n 24:23 [hgb] 约 书 亚 说 ， 你 们 现 在 要 除 掉 你 们 中 间 的 外 邦 神 ， 专 心 归 向 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel. \n [bbe] Then, he said, put away the strange gods among you, turning your hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel. \n 24:24 [hgb] 百 姓 回 答 约 书 亚 说 ， 我 们 必 事 奉 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 ， 听 从 他 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey. \n [bbe] And the people said to Joshua, We will be the servants of the Lord our God, and we will give ear to his voice. \n 24:25 [hgb] 当 日 ， 约 书 亚 就 与 百 姓 立 约 ， 在 示 剑 为 他 们 立 定 律 例 典 章 。 \n [kjv] So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. \n [bbe] So Joshua made an agreement with the people that day, and gave them a rule and a law in Shechem. \n 24:26 [hgb] 约 书 亚 将 这 些 话 都 写 在 神 的 律 法 书 上 ， 又 将 一 块 大 石 头 立 在 橡 树 下 耶 和 华 的 圣 所 旁 边 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. \n [bbe] And Joshua put these words on record, writing them in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and put it up there under the oak-tree which was in the holy place of the Lord. \n 24:27 [hgb] 约 书 亚 对 百 姓 说 ， 看 哪 ， 这 石 头 可 以 向 我 们 作 见 证 。 因 为 是 听 见 了 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 我 们 的 一 切 话 ， 倘 或 你 们 背 弃 你 们 的 神 ， 这 石 头 就 可 以 向 你 们 作 见 证 （ 倘 或 云 云 或 作 所 以 要 向 你 们 作 见 证 ， 免 得 你 们 背 弃 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ） 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God. \n [bbe] And Joshua said to all the people, See now, this stone is to be a witness against us; for all the words of the Lord have been said to us in its hearing: so it will be a witness against you if you are false to the Lord your God. \n 24:28 [hgb] 于 是 约 书 亚 打 发 百 姓 各 归 自 己 的 地 业 去 了 。 \n [kjv] So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance. \n [bbe] Then Joshua let the people go away, every man to his heritage. \n 24:29 [hgb] 这 些 事 以 后 ， 耶 和 华 的 仆 人 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 ， 正 一 百 一 十 岁 ， 就 死 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old. \n [bbe] Now after these things, the death of Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, took place, he being then a hundred and ten years old. \n 24:30 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 将 他 葬 在 他 地 业 的 境 内 ， 就 是 在 以 法 莲 山 地 的 亭 拿 西 拉 ， 在 迦 实 山 的 北 边 。 \n [kjv] And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash. \n [bbe] And they put his body in the earth in the land of his heritage in Timnath-serah, in the hill-country of Ephraim, to the north of Mount Gaash. \n 24:31 [hgb] 约 书 亚 在 世 和 约 书 亚 死 后 ， 那 些 知 道 耶 和 华 为 以 色 列 人 所 行 诸 事 的 长 老 还 在 的 时 候 ， 以 色 列 人 事 奉 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel. \n [bbe] And Israel was true to the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the older men who were still living after Joshua\u0027s death, and had seen what the Lord had done for Israel. \n 24:32 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 从 埃 及 所 带 来 约 瑟 的 骸 骨 ， 葬 埋 在 示 剑 ， 就 是 在 雅 各 从 前 用 一 百 块 银 子 向 示 剑 的 父 亲 ， 哈 抹 的 子 孙 所 买 的 那 块 地 里 。 这 就 作 了 约 瑟 子 孙 的 产 业 。 \n [kjv] And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. \n [bbe] And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had taken up from Egypt, they put in the earth in Shechem, in the property which Jacob had got from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred shekels: and they became the heritage of the children of Joseph. \n 24:33 [hgb] 亚 伦 的 儿 子 以 利 亚 撒 也 死 了 ， 就 把 他 葬 在 他 儿 子 非 尼 哈 ， 以 法 莲 山 地 所 得 的 小 山 上 。 \n [kjv] And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim. \n [bbe] Then the death of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, took place; and his body was put in the earth in the hill of Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the hill-country of Ephraim. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21/510.html","bookId":239,"book":{"id":239,"title":"Joshua约书亚记(双语小说)","description":"简介： Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses\u0027 minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead;
