And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye? \n [bbe] And they said to Joshua, We are your servants. Then Joshua said to them, Who are you and where do you come from? \n 9:9 [hgb] 他 们 回 答 说 ， 仆 人 从 极 远 之 地 而 来 ， 是 因 听 见 耶 和 华 你 神 的 名 声 和 他 在 埃 及 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， \n [kjv] And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, \n [bbe] And they said to him, Your servants have come from a very far country, because of the name of the Lord your God: for the story of his great name, and of all he did in Egypt has come to our ears, \n 9:10 [hgb] 并 他 向 约 旦 河 东 的 两 个 亚 摩 利 王 ， 就 是 希 实 本 王 西 宏 和 在 亚 斯 他 录 的 巴 珊 王 噩 一 切 所 行 的 事 。 \n [kjv] And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth. \n [bbe] And what he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of Jordan, to Sihon, king of Heshbon, and to Og, king of Bashan, at Ashtaroth. \n 9:11 [hgb] 我 们 的 长 老 和 我 们 那 地 的 一 切 居 民 对 我 们 说 ， 你 们 手 里 要 带 着 路 上 用 的 食 物 去 迎 接 以 色 列 人 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 我 们 是 你 们 的 仆 人 。 现 在 求 你 们 与 我 们 立 约 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us. \n [bbe] So the responsible men and all the people of our country said to us, Take food with you for the journey and go to them, and say to them, We are your servants: so now make an agreement with us. \n 9:12 [hgb] 我 们 出 来 要 往 你 们 这 里 来 的 日 子 ， 从 家 里 带 出 来 的 这 饼 还 是 热 的 。 看 哪 ， 现 在 都 干 了 ， 长 了 霉 了 。 \n [kjv] This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy: \n [bbe] This bread which we have with us for our food, we took warm and new from our houses when starting on our journey to you; but now see, it has become dry and broken up. \n 9:13 [hgb] 这 皮 酒 袋 ， 我 们 盛 酒 的 时 候 还 是 新 的 。 看 哪 ， 现 在 已 经 破 裂 。 我 们 这 衣 服 和 鞋 ， 因 为 道 路 甚 远 ， 也 都 穿 旧 了 。 \n [kjv] And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. \n [bbe] And these wine-skins were new when we put the wine in them, and now they are cracked as you see; and our clothing and our shoes have become old because of our very long journey here. \n 9:14 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 受 了 他 们 些 食 物 ， 并 没 有 求 问 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD. \n [bbe] And the men took some of their food, without requesting directions from the Lord. \n 9:15 [hgb] 于 是 约 书 亚 与 他 们 讲 和 ， 与 他 们 立 约 ， 容 他 们 活 着 。 会 众 的 首 领 也 向 他 们 起 誓 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them. \n [bbe] So Joshua made peace with them, and made an agreement with them that they were not to be put to death: and the chiefs of the people took an oath to them. \n 9:16 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 与 他 们 立 约 之 后 ， 过 了 三 天 才 听 见 他 们 是 近 邻 ， 住 在 以 色 列 人 中 间 的 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them. \n [bbe] Now three days after, when they had made this agreement with them, they had word that these men were their neighbours, living near them. \n 9:17 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 起 行 ， 第 三 天 到 了 他 们 的 城 邑 ， 就 是 基 遍 ， 基 非 拉 ， 比 录 ， 基 列 耶 琳 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim. \n [bbe] And the children of Israel went forward on their journey, and on the third day came to their towns. Now their towns were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim. \n 9:18 [hgb] 因 为 会 众 的 首 领 已 经 指 着 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 向 他 们 起 誓 ， 所 以 以 色 列 人 不 击 杀 他 们 。 全 会 众 就 向 首 领 发 怨 言 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. \n [bbe] And the children of Israel did not put them to death, because the chiefs of the people had taken an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. And all the people made an outcry against the chiefs. \n 9:19 [hgb] 众 首 领 对 全 会 众 说 ， 我 们 已 经 指 着 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 向 他 们 起 誓 ， 现 在 我 们 不 能 害 他 们 。 \n [kjv] But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them. \n [bbe] But all the chiefs said to the people, We have taken an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel, and so we may not put our hands on them. \n 9:20 [hgb] 我 们 要 如 此 待 他 们 ， 容 他 们 活 着 ， 免 得 有 忿 怒 因 我 们 所 起 的 誓 临 到 我 们 身 上 。 \n [kjv] This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them. \n [bbe] This is what we will do to them: we will not put them to death, for fear that wrath may come on us because of our oath to them. \n 9:21 [hgb] 首 领 又 对 会 众 说 ， 要 容 他 们 活 着 。 于 是 他 们 为 全 会 众 作 了 劈 柴 挑 水 的 人 ， 正 如 首 领 对 他 们 所 说 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them. \n [bbe] Keep them living, and let them be servants, cutting wood and getting water for all the people. And all the people did as the chiefs had said to them. \n 9:22 [hgb] 约 书 亚 召 了 他 们 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 为 什 么 欺 哄 我 们 说 我 们 离 你 们 甚 远 呢 ？ 其 实 你 们 是 住 在 我 们 中 间 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us? \n [bbe] Then Joshua sent for them, and said to them, Why have you been false to us, saying, We are very far from you, when you are living among us? \n 9:23 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 是 被 咒 诅 的 。 你 们 中 间 的 人 必 断 不 了 作 奴 仆 ， 为 我 神 的 殿 作 劈 柴 挑 水 的 人 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. \n [bbe] Now because of this you are cursed, and you will for ever be our servants, cutting wood and getting water for the house of my God. \n 9:24 [hgb] 他 们 回 答 约 书 亚 说 ， 因 为 有 人 实 在 告 诉 你 的 仆 人 ， 耶 和 华 你 的 神 曾 吩 咐 他 的 仆 人 摩 西 ， 把 这 全 地 赐 给 你 们 ， 并 在 你 们 面 前 灭 绝 这 地 的 一 切 居 民 ， 所 以 我 们 为 你 们 的 缘 故 甚 怕 丧 命 ， 就 行 了 这 事 。 \n [kjv] And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing. \n [bbe] And, answering Joshua, they said, Because it came to the ears of your servants that the Lord your God had given orders to his servant Moses to give you all this land, and to send destruction on all the people living in it, because of you; so, fearing greatly for our lives because of you, we have done this. \n 9:25 [hgb] 现 在 我 们 在 你 手 中 ， 你 以 怎 样 待 我 们 为 善 为 正 ， 就 怎 样 做 吧 。 \n [kjv] And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do. \n [bbe] And now we are in your hands: do to us whatever seems good and right to you. \n 9:26 [hgb] 于 是 约 书 亚 这 样 待 他 们 ， 救 他 们 脱 离 以 色 列 人 的 手 ， 以 色 列 人 就 没 有 杀 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. \n [bbe] So he kept them safe from the children of Israel, and did not let them be put to death. \n 9:27 [hgb] 当 日 约 书 亚 使 他 们 在 耶 和 华 所 要 选 择 的 地 方 ， 为 会 众 和 耶 和 华 的 坛 作 劈 柴 挑 水 的 人 ， 直 到 今 日 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose. \n [bbe] And that day Joshua made them servants, cutting wood and getting water for the people and for the altar of the Lord, in the place marked out by him, to this day. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21/495.html","bookId":239,"book":{"id":239,"title":"Joshua约书亚记(双语小说)","description":"简介： Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses\u0027 minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this peopl...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
