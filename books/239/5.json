Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said to Joshua, Today the shame of Egypt has been rolled away from you. So that place was named Gilgal, to this day. \\n\\n 5:10 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 在 吉 甲 安 营 。 正 月 十 四 日 晚 上 ， 在 耶 利 哥 的 平 原 守 逾 越 节 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. \\n\\n [bbe] So the children of Israel put up their tents in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the lowlands of Jericho. \\n\\n 5:11 [hgb] 逾 越 节 的 次 日 ， 他 们 就 吃 了 那 地 的 出 产 。 正 当 那 日 吃 无 酵 饼 和 烘 的 谷 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day. \\n\\n [bbe] And on the day after the Passover, they had for their food the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and dry grain on the same day. \\n\\n 5:12 [hgb] 他 们 吃 了 那 地 的 出 产 ， 第 二 日 吗 哪 就 止 住 了 ， 以 色 列 人 也 不 再 有 吗 哪 了 。 那 一 年 ， 他 们 却 吃 迦 南 地 的 出 产 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. \\n\\n [bbe] And there was no more manna from the day after they had for their food the produce of the land; the children of Israel had manna no longer, but that year the produce of the land of Canaan was their food. \\n\\n 5:13 [hgb] 约 书 亚 靠 近 耶 利 哥 的 时 候 ， 举 目 观 看 ， 不 料 ， 有 一 个 人 手 里 有 拔 出 来 的 刀 ， 对 面 站 立 。 约 书 亚 到 他 那 里 ， 问 他 说 ， 你 是 帮 助 我 们 呢 ？ 是 帮 助 我 们 敌 人 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? \\n\\n [bbe] Now when Joshua was near Jericho, lifting up his eyes he saw a man in front of him, with his sword uncovered in his hand: and Joshua went up to him and said, Are you for us or against us? \\n\\n 5:14 [hgb] 他 回 答 说 ， 不 是 的 ， 我 来 是 要 作 耶 和 华 军 队 的 元 帅 。 约 书 亚 就 俯 伏 在 地 下 拜 ， 说 ， 我 主 有 什 么 话 吩 咐 仆 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, No; but I have come as captain of the armies of the Lord. Then Joshua, falling down with his face to the earth in worship, said, What has my lord to say to his servant? \\n\\n 5:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 军 队 的 元 帅 对 约 书 亚 说 ， 把 你 脚 上 的 鞋 脱 下 来 ， 因 为 你 所 站 的 地 方 是 圣 的 。 约 书 亚 就 照 着 行 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the captain of the LORD\u0027s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so. \\n\\n [bbe] And the captain of the Lord\u0027s army said to Joshua, Take off your shoes from your feet, for the place where you are is holy. And Joshua did so. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21/491.html","bookId":239,"book":{"id":239,"title":"Joshua约书亚记(双语小说)","description":"简介： Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses\u0027 minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this peopl...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
