{"id":7315,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"23:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 使 以 色 列 人 安 静 ， 不 与 四 围 的 一 切 仇 敌 争 战 ， 已 经 多 日 。 约 书 亚 年 纪 老 迈 ， [kjv] And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age. [bbe] Now after a long time, when the Lord had given Israel rest from wars on every side, and Joshua was old and full of years, 23:2 [hgb] 就 把 以 色 列 众 人 的 长 老 ， 族 长 ， 审 判 官 ， 并 官 长 都 召 了 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 我 年 纪 已 经 老 迈 。 [kjv] And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age: [bbe] Joshua sent for all Israel, for their responsible men and their chiefs and their judges and their overseers, and said to them, I am old, and full of years: 23:3 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 因 你 们 的 缘 故 向 那 些 国 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， 你 们 亲 眼 看 见 了 ， 因 那 为 你 们 争 战 的 是 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 。 [kjv] And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you. [bbe] You have seen everything the Lord your God has done to all these nations because of you; for it is the Lord your God who has been fighting for you. 23:4 [hgb] 我 所 剪 除 和 所 剩 下 的 各 国 ， 从 约 旦 河 起 到 日 落 之 处 的 大 海 ， 我 已 经 拈 阄 分 给 你 们 各 支 派 为 业 。 [kjv] Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward. [bbe] Now I have given to you, as the heritage of your tribes, all these nations which are still in the land, together with those cut off by me, from Jordan as far as the Great Sea on the west. 23:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 必 将 他 们 从 你 们 面 前 赶 出 去 ， 使 他 们 离 开 你 们 ， 你 们 就 必 得 他 们 的 地 为 业 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 所 应 许 的 。 [kjv] And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you. [bbe] The Lord your God will send them away by force, driving them out before you; and you are to take their land for your heritage, as the Lord your God said to you. 23:6 [hgb] 所 以 ， 你 们 要 大 大 壮 胆 ， 谨 守 遵 行 写 在 摩 西 律 法 书 上 的 一 切 话 ， 不 可 偏 离 左 右 。 [kjv] Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; [bbe] So be very strong to keep and do whatever is recorded in the book of the law of Moses, not turning away from it to the right or to the left; 23:7 [hgb] 不 可 与 你 们 中 间 所 剩 下 的 这 些 国 民 搀 杂 。 他 们 的 神 ， 你 们 不 可 提 他 的 名 ， 不 可 指 着 他 起 誓 ， 也 不 可 事 奉 ， 叩 拜 。 [kjv] That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: [bbe] Have nothing to do with these nations who still are living among you; let not their gods be named by you or used in your oaths; do not be their servants or give them worship: 23:8 [hgb] 只 要 照 着 你 们 到 今 日 所 行 的 ， 专 靠 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 。 [kjv] But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day. [bbe] But be true to the Lord your God as you have been till this day. 23:9 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 已 经 把 又 大 又 强 的 国 民 从 你 们 面 前 赶 出 。 直 到 今 日 ， 没 有 一 人 在 你 们 面 前 站 立 得 住 。 [kjv] For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day. [bbe] For the Lord has sent out from before you nations great and strong: and they have all given way before you till this day. 23:10 [hgb] 你 们 一 人 必 追 赶 千 人 ， 因 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 照 他 所 应 许 的 ， 为 你 们 争 战 。 [kjv] One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you. [bbe] One man of you is able to put to flight a thousand; for it is the Lord your God who is fighting for you, as he has said to you. 23:11 [hgb] 你 们 要 分 外 谨 慎 ， 爱 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 。 [kjv] Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God. [bbe] So keep watch on yourselves, and see that you have love for the Lord your God. 23:12 [hgb] 你 们 若 稍 微 转 去 ， 与 你 们 中 间 所 剩 下 的 这 些 国 民 联 络 ， 彼 此 结 亲 ， 互 相 往 来 ， [kjv] Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: [bbe] For if you go back, joining yourselves to the rest of these nations who are still among you, getting married to them and living with them and they with you: 23:13 [hgb] 你 们 要 确 实 知 道 ， 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 必 不 再 将 他 们 从 你 们 眼 前 赶 出 。 他 们 却 要 成 为 你 们 的 网 罗 ， 机 槛 ， 肋 上 的 鞭 ， 眼 中 的 刺 ， 直 到 你 们 在 耶 和 华 你 们 神 所 赐 的 这 美 地 上 灭 亡 。 [kjv] Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. [bbe] Then you may be certain that the Lord your God will not go on driving these nations out from before you; but they will become a danger and a cause of sin to you, a whip for your sides and thorns in your eyes, till you are cut off from this good land which the Lord your God has given you. 23:14 [hgb] 我 现 在 要 走 世 人 必 走 的 路 。 你 们 是 一 心 一 意 地 知 道 ， 耶 和 华 你 们 神 所 应 许 赐 福 与 你 们 的 话 没 有 一 句 落 空 ， 都 应 验 在 你 们 身 上 了 。 [kjv] And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof. [bbe] Now I am about to go the way of all the earth: and you have seen and are certain, all of you, in your hearts and souls, that in all the good things which the Lord said about you, he has kept faith with you; everything has come true for you. 23:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 们 神 所 应 许 的 一 切 福 气 怎 样 临 到 你 们 身 上 ， 耶 和 华 也 必 照 样 使 各 样 祸 患 临 到 你 们 身 上 ， 直 到 把 你 们 从 耶 和 华 你 们 神 所 赐 的 这 美 地 上 除 灭 。 [kjv] Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. [bbe] And you will see that, as all the good things which the Lord your God undertook to do for you, have come to you, so the Lord will send down on you all the evil things till he has made your destruction complete, and you are cut off from the good land which the Lord your God has given you. 23:16 [hgb] 你 们 若 违 背 耶 和 华 你 们 神 吩 咐 你 们 所 守 的 约 ， 去 事 奉 别 神 ， 叩 拜 他 ， 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 必 向 你 们 发 作 ， 使 你 们 在 他 所 赐 的 美 地 上 速 速 灭 亡 。 [kjv] When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you. [bbe] If the agreement of the Lord your God, which was given to you by his orders, is broken, and you become the servants of other gods and give them worship, then the wrath of the Lord will be burning against you, and you will quickly be cut off from the good land which he has given you.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21/509.html","bookId":239,"book":{"id":239,"title":"Joshua约书亚记(双语小说)","description":"简介： Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses\u0027 minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this peopl...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
