you are to have the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire. \n 11:7 [hgb] 于 是 约 书 亚 率 领 一 切 兵 丁 ， 在 米 伦 水 边 突 然 向 前 攻 打 他 们 。 \n [kjv] So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them. \n [bbe] So Joshua and all the men of war with him came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and made an attack on them. \n 11:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 将 他 们 交 在 以 色 列 人 手 里 ， 以 色 列 人 就 击 杀 他 们 ， 追 赶 他 们 到 西 顿 大 城 ， 到 米 斯 利 弗 玛 音 ， 直 到 东 边 米 斯 巴 的 平 原 ， 将 他 们 击 杀 ， 没 有 留 下 一 个 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining. \n [bbe] And the Lord gave them up into the hands of Israel, and they overcame them driving them back to great Zidon and to Misrephoth-maim and into the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they put them all to death, no man got away safely. \n 11:9 [hgb] 约 书 亚 就 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 去 行 ， 砍 断 他 们 马 的 蹄 筋 ， 用 火 焚 烧 他 们 的 车 辆 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. \n [bbe] And Joshua did to them as the Lord had said to him; he had the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire. \n 11:10 [hgb] 当 时 ， 约 书 亚 转 回 夺 了 夏 琐 ， 用 刀 击 杀 夏 琐 王 。 素 来 夏 琐 在 这 诸 国 中 是 为 首 的 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. \n [bbe] At that time, Joshua went on to take Hazor and put its king to the sword: for in earlier times Hazor was the chief of all those kingdoms. \n 11:11 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 用 刀 击 杀 城 中 的 人 口 ， 将 他 们 尽 行 杀 灭 。 凡 有 气 息 的 没 有 留 下 一 个 。 约 书 亚 又 用 火 焚 烧 夏 琐 。 \n [kjv] And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire. \n [bbe] And they put every person in it to death without mercy, giving every living thing up to the curse, and burning Hazor. \n 11:12 [hgb] 约 书 亚 夺 了 这 些 王 的 一 切 城 邑 ， 擒 获 其 中 的 诸 王 ， 用 刀 击 杀 他 们 ， 将 他 们 尽 行 杀 灭 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 仆 人 摩 西 所 吩 咐 的 。 \n [kjv] And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. \n [bbe] And all the towns of these kings, and all the kings, Joshua took, and put them to the sword: he gave them up to the curse, as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had said. \n 11:13 [hgb] 至 于 造 在 山 冈 上 的 城 ， 除 了 夏 琐 以 外 ， 以 色 列 人 都 没 有 焚 烧 。 约 书 亚 只 将 夏 琐 焚 烧 了 。 \n [kjv] But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn. \n [bbe] As for the towns made on hills of earth, not one was burned by Israel but Hazor, which was burned by Joshua. \n 11:14 [hgb] 那 些 城 邑 所 有 的 财 物 和 牲 畜 ， 以 色 列 人 都 取 为 自 己 的 掠 物 。 惟 有 一 切 人 口 都 用 刀 击 杀 ， 直 到 杀 尽 。 凡 有 气 息 的 没 有 留 下 一 个 。 \n [kjv] And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe. \n [bbe] And all the goods taken from these towns, and their cattle, the children of Israel kept for themselves; but every man they put to death without mercy, till their destruction was complete, and there was no one living. \n 11:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 怎 样 吩 咐 他 仆 人 摩 西 ， 摩 西 就 照 样 吩 咐 约 书 亚 ， 约 书 亚 也 照 样 行 。 凡 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 ， 约 书 亚 没 有 一 件 懈 怠 不 行 的 。 \n [kjv] As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] As the Lord had given orders to Moses his servant, so Moses gave orders to Joshua, and so Joshua did; every order which the Lord had given to Moses was done. \n 11:16 [hgb] 约 书 亚 夺 了 那 全 地 ， 就 是 山 地 ， 一 带 南 地 ， 歌 珊 全 地 ， 高 原 ， 亚 拉 巴 ， 以 色 列 的 山 地 ， 和 山 下 的 高 原 。 \n [kjv] So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; \n [bbe] So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland and the Arabah, the hill-country of Israel and its lowland; \n 11:17 [hgb] 从 上 西 珥 的 哈 拉 山 ， 直 到 黑 门 山 下 利 巴 嫩 平 原 的 巴 力 迦 得 ， 并 且 擒 获 那 些 地 的 诸 王 ， 将 他 们 杀 死 。 \n [kjv] Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them. \n [bbe] From Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon: and all their kings he overcame and put to death. \n 11:18 [hgb] 约 书 亚 和 这 诸 王 争 战 了 许 多 年 日 。 \n [kjv] Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. \n [bbe] For a long time Joshua made war on all those kings. \n 11:19 [hgb] 除 了 基 遍 的 希 未 人 之 外 ， 没 有 一 城 与 以 色 列 人 讲 和 的 ， 都 是 以 色 列 人 争 战 夺 来 的 。 \n [kjv] There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle. \n [bbe] Not one town made peace with the children of Israel, but only the Hivites of Gibeon: they took them all in war. \n 11:20 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 的 意 思 是 要 使 他 们 心 里 刚 硬 ， 来 与 以 色 列 人 争 战 ， 好 叫 他 们 尽 被 杀 灭 ， 不 蒙 怜 悯 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 。 \n [kjv] For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] For the Lord made them strong in heart to go to war against Israel, so that he might give them up to the curse without mercy, and that destruction might come on them, as the Lord had given orders to Moses. \n 11:21 [hgb] 当 时 约 书 亚 来 到 ， 将 住 山 地 ， 希 伯 仑 ， 底 璧 ， 亚 拿 伯 ， 犹 大 山 地 ， 以 色 列 山 地 所 有 的 亚 衲 族 人 剪 除 了 。 约 书 亚 将 他 们 和 他 们 的 城 邑 尽 都 毁 灭 。 \n [kjv] And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities. \n [bbe] And Joshua came at that time and put an end to the Anakim in the hill-country, in Hebron, in Debir, in Anab, and in all the hill-country of Judah and Israel: Joshua gave them and their towns to the curse. \n 11:22 [hgb] 在 以 色 列 人 的 地 没 有 留 下 一 个 亚 衲 族 人 ， 只 在 迦 萨 ， 迦 特 ， 和 亚 实 突 有 留 下 的 。 \n [kjv] There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained. \n [bbe] Not one of the Anakim was to be seen in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, some were still living. \n 11:23 [hgb] 这 样 ， 约 书 亚 照 着 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 一 切 话 夺 了 那 全 地 ， 就 按 着 以 色 列 支 派 的 宗 族 将 地 分 给 他 们 为 业 。 于 是 国 中 太 平 ， 没 有 争 战 了 。 \n [kjv] So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war. \n [bbe] So Joshua took all the land, as the Lord had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it to the children of Israel as their heritage, making division of it among them by their tribes. And the land had rest from war. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21/497.html","bookId":239,"book":{"id":239,"title":"Joshua约书亚记(双语小说)","description":"简介： Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses\u0027 minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this peopl...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/21","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
