{"id":15813,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV. TWO PLEBES IN HOSPITAL.","content":"\"Say, tell me, did you do him?\" The speaker was a lad with brown, curly hair and a laughing, merry face, at present, however, half covered with a swathing of bandages. He was standing on the steps of the hospital building at West Point, and regarding with anxiety another lad of about the same age, but taller and more sturdily built. \"I don\u0027t know that I did him,\" responded Mark—for the one addressed was he—\"I don\u0027t know that I can say I did him, but I believe I would have if the fight hadn\u0027t been interrupted.\" \"Bully, b\u0027gee!\" cried the other, excitedly slapping his knee and wincing with pain afterward. \"Gimme your hand! I\u0027m proud of you, b\u0027gee! My name\u0027s Alan Dewey, at your service.\" Mark took the proffered hand, smiling at the stranger\u0027s joy. [Pg 118]\"My success seems to cause you considerable pleasure,\" he said. \"Yes, b\u0027gee!\" exclaimed Dewey, \"it does! And to every true and loyal plebe in the academy. You\u0027ve brought honor to the name of plebe by licking the biggest yearling in the place, b\u0027gee, and that means the end of hazing.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure of that,\" said Mark. \"I am,\" returned the other. \"But say, tell me something about the fight. I wanted to come, only I was shut up in hospital. Did Williams put up a good one?\" \"Splendid,\" said Mark. \"He ought to. They say he\u0027s champion of his class, and an all-round athlete. But you look as if you could fight some yourself.\" \"He almost had me beaten once,\" said Mark. \"I thought I was a goner.\" \"Say, but you\u0027re a spunky chap!\" remarked Dewey, eying Mark with an admiring expression. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s ever been a plebe dared to do half what you\u0027ve done. The whole class is talking about you.\" \"Is that so?\" inquired Mark, laughing. \"I didn\u0027t mean to do anything reckless.\" [Pg 119]\"What\u0027s the difference,\" laughed the other, \"when you can lick \u0027em all, b\u0027gee? I wish I could do it,\" he added, rather more solemnly. \"Then, perhaps, maybe I wouldn\u0027t be the physical wreck that I am.\" \"You been fighting, too?\" inquired Mark, laughing. \"Betcher life, b\u0027gee!\" responded the other, emphatically. \"Only I wasn\u0027t as clever at it as you.\" \"Tell me about it,\" said Mark, with interest. \"It happened last Saturday afternoon, and I\u0027ve been in hospital ever since, b\u0027gee. Some of the cadets caught me taking a walk up somewhere near what they call \u0027Crow\u0027s Nest.\u0027 And so they set out to have some fun. Told me to climb a tree, in the first place. I looked at the tree, and, b\u0027gee, there wasn\u0027t a limb for thirty feet, and the limbs there were rotten. There was one of \u0027em, a big, burly fellow with short hair and a scar on his cheek——\" \"Bull Harris!\" cried Mark. \"Yes,\" said Dewey, \"that\u0027s what they called him—\u0027Bull.\u0027\" \"Did you fight with him?\" \"Betcher life, b\u0027gee! He tried to make me climb that tree, and, b\u0027gee, says I, \u0027I won\u0027t, b\u0027gee!\u0027 Then I lammed him one in the eye——\" [Pg 120]\"Bully!\" cried Mark, and then he added, \"b\u0027gee!\" by way of company. \"Did he beat you?\" \"Betcher life,\" cried the other. \"That is, the six of \u0027em did.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say the crowd attacked you?\" \"That\u0027s what I said.\" \"Well, sir!\" exclaimed Mark, \"the more I hear of that Bull Harris the bigger coward I find him. It\u0027s comforting to know that all the cadets aren\u0027t that way.\" \"Very comforting!\" responded the other, feeling of the bandage on his swollen jaw. \"Very comforting! Reminds me of a story I heard once, b\u0027gee, of a man who got a thousand dollars\u0027 comfort from a railroad for having his head cut off.\" Mark laughed for a moment, and then he fell to tapping the step thoughtfully with his heel. He was thinking over a plan. \"I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve much love for the yearlings,\" he remarked, at last. \"Bet cher life not,\" laughed the other. \"I\u0027ve about as much as a mother-in-law for a professional joke writer, b\u0027gee! Reminds me of a story I once heard—but go on; I want to hear what you had to say. Tell my story later.\" [Pg 121]\"Well, three friends of mine have formed a sort of an informal alliance for self-defence——\" \"Bully, b\u0027gee!\" cried Dewey, excitedly. \"And I thought maybe you\u0027d like to——\" \"Join? Bet cher life, b\u0027gee! Why didn\u0027t you say so before? Whoop!\" And thus it happened that Member Number Five of the West Point \"alliance\" was discovered. \"I don\u0027t think this famous alliance is going to have much to do at the start,\" said Mark, as soon as Master Dewey had recovered from his excitement, \"for I rather fancy the yearlings will leave us alone for a time.\" \"Bet cher life, b\u0027gee!\" assented the other. \"If they don\u0027t look out they won\u0027t have time to be sorry.\" \"B\u0027gee!\" added Mark, smiling. \"Do I say that much?\" inquired the other, with a laugh. \"I suppose I must, because the fellows have nicknamed me \u0027B\u0027gee.\u0027 I declare I\u0027m not conscious of saying it. Do I?\" \"Bet cher life, b\u0027gee,\" responded Mark, whereupon his new acquaintance broke into one of his merry laughs. \"Let\u0027s go around to barracks,\" said Mark, finally—it was then just after breakfast time. \"I expect they\u0027ll[Pg 122] want me to report for drill. I thought I\u0027d get off for the morning on the strength of my \u0027contusions,\u0027 as they call them. But the old surgeon was too sly for me. He patched me up in a jiffy.\" \"What was the matter with you?\" inquired Dewey, dropping his smile. \"One eye\u0027s about half shut, as you see,\" responded Mark, \"and then I had quite a little cut on the side of my head where Williams hit me once. Otherwise I am all right—only just a little rocky.\" \"As the sea captain remarked of the harbor, b\u0027gee,\" added the other. \"But tell me, how\u0027s Williams?\" \"Pretty well done up, as the laundryman remarked, to borrow your style of illustration,\" Mark responded, laughing. \"They had to carry poor Williams down here. He\u0027s in there now being fixed up. And say, you should have seen how queerly the surgeon looked at us two. He knew right away what was up, of course, but he never said a word—just entered us \u0027sick—contusions.\u0027 Is that what you were?\" \"Bet cher life, b\u0027gee!\" responded the other. \"But he tried to get me to tell what was up. He rather suspected hazing, I think. I didn\u0027t say anything, though.\" [Pg 123]\"It would have served some of those chaps just right if you had,\" vowed Mark. \"You know you could have every one of them expelled.\" The two had reached the area of barracks by this time, and hurried over to reach their rooms before inspection. \"And don\u0027t you mention what I\u0027ve told you about this great alliance to a soul,\" Mark enjoined. \"We\u0027d have the whole academy about our ears in a day.\" Dewey assented. \"What\u0027s the name of it?\" he inquired. \"Haven\u0027t got any name for it yet,\" said Mark, \"or any leader either, in fact. We\u0027re waiting to get a few more members, enough for a little excitement. Then we\u0027ll organize, elect a leader, swear allegiance, and you can bet there\u0027ll be fun—b\u0027gee!\" \"Come up to my room,\" he added, after a moment\u0027s pause, \"as soon as you get fixed up for inspection, and I\u0027ll introduce you to the other fellows.\" With which parting word he turned and bounded up the stairs to his own room. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88088.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
