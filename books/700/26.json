{"id":15824,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. THE FINISH OF A RACE.","content":"So it was; certain of the cadets, being piqued at the evident superiority which that B. J. Mallory (his usual title by this time) had displayed in the water, had requested their captain to take him down. The \"captain\" had good-naturedly declared that he was willing to try; and the shout that attracted Bull\u0027s attention was caused by the plebe\u0027s ready assent to the proposition for an impromptu race. \"Fischer ought to be ashamed of himself, to have anything to do with him!\" was Bull Harris\u0027 angry verdict. \"I almost hope the plebe beats him.\" \"I don\u0027t!\" vowed Murray, emphatically. \"Let\u0027s hurry up, and see it.\" The latter speaker suited the action to the word; Bull followed, growling surlily. \"Look at that gang of plebes!\" he muttered. \"They\u0027re the ones who helped Mallory take away the fellow we were hazing; they think they\u0027re right in it, now.\" [Pg 212]\"Yes,\" chimed in Baby. \"And see that fellow, Texas, making a fool of himself.\" \"That fellow Texas\" was \"making a fool of himself\" by dancing about in wild excitement, and raising a series of cowboy whoops in behalf of his friend, and of plebes in general. \"There they are, ready to go!\" cried Murray, betraying some excitement. \"I wish the confounded plebe\u0027d never come up again!\" growled Bull, in return, striving hard to appear indifferent. \"I bet Fischer\u0027ll do him!\" exclaimed the Baby. \"He swims like a fish. Say, they\u0027re going to race to that tree way down the river. Golly, but that\u0027s a long swim!\" \"Long nothing!\" sneered Vance. \"I could swim that a dozen times. But, say, they\u0027ll finish in the rain; look at that thunderstorm coming!\" In response to this last remark, the crowd cast their eyes in the direction indicated. They found that the prediction seemed likely to be fulfilled. To the north, up the Hudson, dense, black clouds already obscured the sky, and a strong, fresh breeze, that smelled of rain, was[Pg 213] springing up from thence, and making the swimmers shiver apprehensively. The preparation for the race went on, however; nobody cared for the storm. \"Gee whiz!\" cried the Baby, in excitement. \"Won\u0027t it be exciting! I don\u0027t mind the rain. I\u0027m going to run down along the shore, and watch it! Hooray!\" \"Rats!\" growled Bull, angrily. \"I don\u0027t care about any old race. I\u0027m going to keep dry, let me tell you!\" Even the damper of his idol\u0027s displeasure could not change Master Edwards\u0027 mind, however; he and nearly the whole crowd with him made a dash down the shore for a vantage point to see the finish. \"There! They\u0027re off!\" The cry came a moment later, as the two lightly-clad figures stepped to the mark from which they were to start. They were about of one size, magnificently proportioned, both of them, and the race bid fair to be a close one. \"Ready?\" called the starter, in a voice that rang down the shore. \"Yes,\" responded Mark, and at the same moment a heavy cloud swept under the sun, and the air grew dark[Pg 214] and chilly. The wind increased to a gale, blowing the spray before it; and then—— \"Go!\" called the starter. The two dived as one figure; both took the water clean and low, with no perceptible splash; two heads appeared a moment later, forging ahead side by side; a cheer from the cadets arose, that drowned, for a moment, the roars of the storm; and the race was on. It is remarkable how closely nature follows a rule in her most perfect work; here were two figures, built by her a thousand miles apart, racing there, and each striving with might and main, yet the sum total of the energy that each was able to expend so nearly alike that yard by yard they struggled on, without an inch of difference between them. \"Fischer! Fischer!\" rose the shouts of the cadets. \"Mallory! Mallory!\" roared the excited plebes, backed up by an occasional \"Wow!\" in the stentorian tones of the mighty Texan, who, by this time, was on the verge of epilepsy. Onward went the two heads, still side by side, seeming to creep through the water at a snail\u0027s pace to the excited partisans on the shore. But it was no snail\u0027s pace to the[Pg 215] two in the water; each was struggling in grim earnestness, putting into every stroke all the power that was in him. Neither looked at the other; but each could tell, from the cries of the cadets, that his opponent was pressing him closely. Nearer and nearer they came to the far distant goal; higher and higher rose the shouts: \"Fischer! Fischer!\" \"Mallory! Mallory!\" \"He\u0027s got him!\" \"No.\" \"Hooray!\" \"Gee! but it is exciting,\" screamed Baby. \"Go it, Fischer! Do him!\" \"And I wish that confounded \u0027beast\u0027 was in Hades!\" snarled Bull, whose hatred of Mark was deeper, and more malignant than that of his friend. \"I believe I could kill him!\" During all this excitement the storm had been sweeping rapidly up, its majesty unnoticed in the excitement of the race. Far up the Hudson could be seen a driving cloud of rain; and the wind had risen to a hurricane, while the air grew dark and chill. The race was at its most exciting stage—the finish, and the cadets were dancing about, half in a frenzy, yelling incoherently, at the two still struggling lads, when some[Pg 216] one, nobody knew just who, chanced to glance for one brief instant up the river. A moment later a cry was heard that brought the race to a startling and unexpected close. \"Look! look! The sailboat!\" The cry sounded even above the roar of the storm and the shouts of the crowd. The cadets turned in alarm and gazed up the river. What they saw made them forget that such a thing as a race ever existed. Right in the teeth of the wind, in the center of the river, was a small catboat, driven downstream, before the gale, with the speed of a locomotive. In the boat was one person, and the person was a girl. She sat in the stern, waving her hands in helpless terror, and even as the spectators stared, the boat gibed with terrific violence, and a volume of water poured in over the gunwale. The crowd was thrown into confusion; a babel of excited voices arose, and the race was forgotten in an instant. The racers were not slow to notice it; both of them turned to gaze behind them, and to take in the situation. \"Help! Help!\" called a faint voice from the distant sailboat. [Pg 217]Help! Who was there to help? There was not a boat in sight; the cadets were running up and down in confusion, hunting for one in vain. They were like a nest of frightened ants, without a leader, skurrying this way and that, and only contributing to the general alarm. The girl herself could do nothing, and so it seemed as if help were far away, indeed. There was one person in the crowd, however, who kept his head in the midst of all that confusion. And the person was Mark. Exhausted though he was by his desperate swim, he did not hesitate an instant. Before the amazed cadet captain at his side could half comprehend his intention, he turned quickly in the water, and, with one powerful stroke, shot away toward the center of the stream. The cadets on the shore scarcely knew whether to cry out in horror, or to cheer the act they saw. They caught one more glimpse of the catboat as it raced ahead before the gale; they saw the gallant plebe struggling in the water. And then the storm struck them in its fury. A blinding[Pg 218] sheet of driving rain, that darkened the air and drove against the river, and rose again in clouds of spray; a gale that lashed the water into fury; and darkness that shut out the river, and the boat, and the swimmer, and left nothing but a humbled group of shivering cadets.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88099.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
