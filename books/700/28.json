{"id":15826,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. MARK MEETS THE SUPERINTENDENT.","content":"\"Yes, colonel, the lad is a hero, and I want to tell him so, too!\" The speaker was a tall, gray-haired gentleman, and he whacked his cane on the floor for emphasis as he spoke. \"It was a splendid act, sir, splendid!\" he continued. \"And I want to thank Mark Mallory for it right here in your office.\" The man he addressed wore the uniform of the United States army; he was Colonel Harvey, the superintendent of the West Point Academy. \"I shall be most happy to have you do so,\" he replied, smiling at this visitor\u0027s enthusiasm. \"You have certainly,\" he added, \"much to thank the young man for.\" \"Much!\" echoed the other. \"Much! Why, my dear sir, if that daughter of mine had been drowned I believe it would have killed me. She is my only child, and, if I do say it myself, sir, the sweetest girl that ever lived.\" [Pg 232]\"Wasn\u0027t it rather reckless, judge,\" inquired the other, \"for you to allow her to go sailing alone?\" \"She is used to the boat,\" responded Judge Fuller, \"but no one on earth could have handled it in such a gale. I do not remember to have seen such a one in all the time I have lived up here.\" \"Nor I, either,\" said the superintendent. \"It was so dark that I could scarcely see across the parade ground. It is almost miraculous that Mallory should have succeeded in finding the boat as he did.\" \"Tell me about it,\" put in the other. \"I have not been able to get a consistent account yet.\" \"Cadet Captain Fischer told me,\" responded the colonel. \"It seems that he and Mallory were just at the finish of a swimming race when the storm broke. They caught sight of the boat with your daughter in it coming down stream. The plebe turned, exhausted though he was, and headed for it. It got so dark then that those on shore could scarcely see; but the lad managed to catch the boat as it passed and climbed aboard. Just then the boom swung round and flung the girl into the water. Mallory dived again at once——\" \"Splendid!\" interrupted the other. [Pg 233]\"And swam ashore with her.\" \"And then fainted, they say,\" the judge added. \"Yes,\" said Colonel Harvey. \"Dr. Grimes told me that it was one of the worst cases of exhaustion he had ever seen. But the lad is doing well now; he appears to be a very vigorous youngster—and I\u0027ve an idea several of the yearlings found that out to their discomfort. The doctor told me that he thought he would be out this morning; the accident was only two days ago.\" \"That is fortunate,\" responded the other. \"The boy is too good to lose.\" \"He appears to be a remarkable lad generally,\" continued the superintendent. \"I have heard several tales about him. Some of the stories came to me \u0027unofficially,\u0027 as we call it, and I don\u0027t believe Mallory would rest easily if he thought I knew of them. Young Fischer, who\u0027s a splendid man himself, I\u0027ll tell you, informed me yesterday that the plebe had earned his admission fee by bringing help to a wrecked train and telegraphing the account to a New York paper.\" \"I heard he had been in some trouble about demerits,\" put in Judge Fuller. \"In very serious trouble. I had to take a very radical[Pg 234] step to get him out of it. Every once in a while I find that some new cadet is being \u0027skinned,\u0027 as the cadets call it, demerited unfairly. I always punish severely when I find that out. In this case, though, I had no proof; Mallory would say nothing, though he was within five demerits of expulsion. So I decided to end the whole matter by declaring a new rule I\u0027ve been contemplating for some time. I\u0027ve found that new cadets get too many demerits during the first few weeks, before they learn the rules thoroughly. So I\u0027ve decided that in future no demerits shall be given for the first three weeks, and that delinquencies shall be punished by extra hours and other penalties. That let Mallory out of his trouble, you see.\" \"A very clever scheme!\" laughed the other. \"Very clever!\" It may be of interest to notice that Colonel Harvey\u0027s rule has been in effect ever since. There was silence of a few moments after that, during which Judge Fuller tapped the floor with his cane reflectively. \"You promised to let me see this Mallory,\" he said, suddenly. \"I\u0027m ready now.\" [Pg 235]By way of answer, the superintendent rang a bell upon his desk. \"Go over to the hospital,\" he said to the orderly who appeared in the doorway, \"and find out if Cadet Mallory is able to be about. If he is, bring him here at once.\" The boy disappeared and the colonel turned to his visitor and smiled. \"Is that satisfactory?\" he inquired. \"Very!\" responded the other. \"And I only wish that you could send for my daughter to come over, too. I hope those surgeons are taking care of her.\" \"As much as if she were their own,\" answered the colonel. \"I cannot tell you how glad I was to learn that she is beyond danger.\" \"It is God\u0027s mercy,\" said the other, with feeling. \"She could not have had a much narrower escape.\" And after that neither said anything until a knock at the door signaled the arrival of the orderly. \"Come in,\" called the superintendent, and two figures stepped into the room. One was the messenger, and the other was Mark. \"This,\" said the superintendent after a moment\u0027s pause, \"is Cadet Mallory.\" [Pg 236]And Cadet Mallory it was. The same old Mark, only paler and more weak just then. Judge Fuller rose and bowed gravely. \"Sit down,\" said he, \"you are not strong enough to stand.\" And after that no one said anything for fully a minute; the last speaker resumed his seat and fell to studying Mark\u0027s face in silence. And Mark waited respectfully for him to begin. \"My name,\" said he at last, \"is Fuller.\" \"Judge Fuller?\" inquired Mark. \"Yes. And Grace Fuller is my daughter.\" After that there was silence again, broken suddenly by the excitable old gentleman dropping his cane, springing up from his chair, and striding over toward the lad. \"I want to shake hands with you, sir! I want to shake hands with you!\" he cried. Mark was somewhat taken aback; but he arose and did as he was asked. \"And now,\" said the judge, \"I guess that\u0027s all—sit down, sir, sit down; you\u0027ve little strength left, I can see. I want to thank you, sir, for being the finest lad I\u0027ve met for a long time. And when my daughter gets well[Pg 237]—which she will, thank the Lord—I\u0027ll be very glad to have you call on us, or else to let us call on you—seeing that we live beyond cadet limits. And if ever you get into trouble, here or anywhere, just come and see me about it, and I\u0027ll be much obliged to you. And that\u0027s all.\" Having said which, the old gentleman stalked across the room once more, picked up his hat and cane, and made for the door. \"Good-day, sir,\" he said. \"I\u0027m going around now to see my daughter. Good-day, and God bless you.\" After which the door was shut. It was several minutes after that before Colonel Harvey said anything. \"You have made a powerful friend, my boy,\" he remarked, smiling at the recollection of the old gentleman\u0027s strange speech. \"And you have brought honor upon the academy. I am proud of you—proud to have you here.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Mark, simply. \"All I have to say besides that,\" added the officer, \"is to watch out that you stay. Don\u0027t get any more demerits.\" \"I\u0027ll try not, sir.\" [Pg 238]\"Do. And I guess you had best go and join your company now if the doctor thinks you\u0027re able. Something is happening to-day which always interests new cadets. I bid you good-morning, Mr. Mallory.\" And Mark went out of that office and crossed the street to barracks feeling as if he were walking on air.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88101.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
