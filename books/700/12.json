{"id":15810,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. THE EMBASSY OF THE PARSON.","content":"\"What\u0027s happened?\" cried Texas, as soon as he\u0027d managed to get calm enough to talk coherently. \"What\u0027s happened?\" \"Sit down,\" said Mark, laughing in spite of himself. \"Sit down and stop your dancing. Everybody in the place is staring at you.\" Texas sat, and then Mark described to him just what had happened. As might have been expected, he was up in arms in a moment. \"Where is that feller? Now, look a \u0027yere, Mark, leggo me. Thar he goes! Say, if I don\u0027t git him by the neck an\u0027——\" The excitable youth was quieted after some ten minutes\u0027 work or so, and immediate danger was over. \"And now,\" said Mark, \"where\u0027s the Parson?\" \"Over in library,\" responded the other, \"a fossilizin\u0027. What do you want with him?\" [Pg 92]\"You be good,\" said Mark, \"and I\u0027ll let you see. Come on.\" They found the Parson as Texas had said, and they managed to separate him from the books and drag him over to barracks. Then Mark, who by this time had recovered his usual easy good-nature, told of \"Mr. Murray\u0027s\" insult again. \"Now, I haven\u0027t the least objection,\" he continued, \"of being sent to Coventry. In fact, so long as it means the cadets\u0027 leaving me alone, I rather like the idea. But I don\u0027t propose to stand a thing like that which just happened for a moment. So there\u0027s got to be a fight, and if they won\u0027t let me, I\u0027ll have to make \u0027em, that\u0027s all.\" \"Um,\" said the Parson, looking grave. \"Um.\" \"Now, as for that fellow Murray,\" added Mark, \"I don\u0027t propose to fight him.\" \"Wow!\" shouted Texas. \"What in thunder do you mean? Now if you don\u0027t, by jingo! I\u0027ll go and do it myself!\" \"Take it easy,\" said Mark, laughing. \"You see, Williams is the man the class has selected to beat me; he\u0027s the best fighter. Now, if I beat anybody else it won\u0027t do me the least bit of good; they\u0027d still say I\u0027m afraid of[Pg 93] Williams. So I\u0027m going to try him first. How\u0027s that, Texas?\" \"Reckon you\u0027re right,\" admitted Powers, rather sheepishly. \"I \u0027spose you\u0027ll let me go and arrange it, hey?\" \"I\u0027d as soon think of sending a dynamite bomb,\" laughed Mark. \"You\u0027d be in a fight before he\u0027d said three words. That\u0027s what I wanted the Parson for. I think he\u0027d be grave and scholarly even if they ate him.\" \"Thank you,\" said the Parson, gravely. \"I should try.\" \"Wow!\" growled Texas. And thus it happened that the Parson set out for \"Camp McPherson,\" a short while later, his learned head full of prize fighting and the methods and practice of diplomacy. It was rather an unusual thing for a plebe to do—this venturing into \"camp;\" and the cadets stared at the Parson, wondering what an amount of curiosity he must have to go prospecting within the lines of the enemy. The Parson, however, did not act as if curiosity had brought him; with a businesslike air and a solemn visage he strode down the company street, and, heedless of the cadets who had gathered at the tent doors to see him,[Pg 94] halted in front of one before which he saw \"Billy\" Williams standing. \"Mr. Williams?\" said the Parson. Mr. Williams had been engaged in vigorously drying his face; he paused, and gazed up out of the towel in surprise, and one of his tent mates, Cadet Captain Fischer, ceased unwinding himself from his long red sash and stared. \"My name is Stanard,\" said the Parson—\"Peter Stanard.\" \"Pleased to meet you,\" said Williams, stretching out a long, brawny arm. There was a twinkle in the yearling\u0027s eye as he glanced at the skinny white fingers which Stanard put out in return. And, taking in the stranger\u0027s lank, scholarly figure, Williams seized the hand and squeezed with all his might. He expected to hear a howl, but he was disappointed. The Parson drew up his \"prehensile muscles,\" as he called them. The result was that Cadet Williams turned white, but he said nothing about it, and invited the stranger into his tent. The Parson deposited himself gently in one corner and[Pg 95] drew up his long legs under him. Then he gazed out of the tent and said—\"ahem!\" \"Warm day,\" said Williams, by way of a starter. \"It is not that the temperature is excessively altitudinous,\" responded the Parson, \"but the presence of a larger proportion of humidity retards perspiratory exudation.\" \"Er—yes,\" said Williams. \"Yes, I think that\u0027s it.\" \"I have come—ahem!\" continued Stanard, \"as a representative of Mr. Mallory.\" The other bowed. \"Mr. Mallory desires to know—if you will pardon my abruptness in proceeding immediately to the matter in hand—to know if it is not possible for you to fulfill a certain—er—engagement which you had with him.\" \"I see,\" said Williams, thoughtfully, and he tapped the floor with his foot for a minute or so. \"Mr. Mallory, of course, understands,\" he continued at last, \"that I have no grudge against him at all.\" \"Certainly,\" said the Parson. \"In fact, I rather admire Mr. Mallory, on the whole, though some of his actions have been, I think, imprudent. In this matter I am simply the deputy of the class.\" \"Exactly,\" said the Parson, bowing profusely. [Pg 96]\"Therefore, I fight when the class says so, and when they say no, what reason have I for fighting? Now, the class thinks that Mr. Mallory has had chance enough, and——\" \"But they don\u0027t know the circumstances!\" protested Stanard, with more suddenness than was usual with him. \"They do not,\" responded the other. \"But they\u0027d like to.\" \"I do not know them myself,\" said the Parson. \"But I have faith enough in Mr. Mallory to take his word that it was unavoidable.\" \"You must have a good deal,\" added Williams, his handsome face looking grave, \"a good deal to risk being sent to Coventry.\" \"I am willing. Examples of yet higher devotion to a fides amicus, so to speak, are by no means extraordinary. Take the popular instance of Damon and Pythias, or, if you look for one yet more conspicuous, I would mention Prylocates and Tyndarus, in the well-known play of \"The Captive,\" by Plautus, with which you are doubtless familiar.\" And the Parson closed his learned discourse with his favorite occupation of wiping his brow. [Pg 97]\"The risk is your own,\" responded the yearling, calmly. \"You must not mind if the class resents your view of the case.\" There was a few moments\u0027 silence after that, during which the Parson racked his head to think what to say next. \"You refuse, then, to fight Mr. Mallory?\" he inquired at last. \"Absolutely!\" responded the other. \"Absolutely, until the class so directs.\" Then the Parson drew a long breath, and prepared for the culminating stroke. \"What I say next, Mr. Williams,\" said he, \"you will understand is said with all possible politeness and good feeling, but it must be said. Mr. Mallory has been insulted by some cadets as a coward. He must free himself from the suspicion. Mr. Williams, if a plebe should strike an older cadet, would that make a fight necessary?\" \"Most certainly,\" said Williams, flushing. \"Well, now, suppose he simply threatened to do so,\" continued Stanard. \"Would that be cause enough?\" \"It might.\" \"Well, then, Mr. Williams, Mr. Mallory desires me[Pg 98] with all politeness to beg permission to threaten to strike you.\" \"I see,\" said the other, smiling at the solemn air with which the lank stranger made this extraordinary request. \"I see. I have no objection to his so doing.\" \"Thank you,\" said Stanard. \"A fight is now necessary, I believe?\" \"Er—yes,\" said Williams. \"I believe it is.\" The fact of the matter was that he saw that Mark was in a position to force a fight if he chose, and the yearling was by no means reluctant, anyhow. \"I thank you for your courtesy,\" he continued, bowing Stanard out of the tent. \"Tell Mr. Mallory that I shall send my second to see him this evening. Good-day.\" And Stanard bowed and strode away with joy in his very stride. \"We have met the enemy,\" was his report to Mark. \"We have met the enemy, and there\u0027s going to be a fight!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88085.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
