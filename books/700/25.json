{"id":15823,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. A SWIMMING MATCH.","content":"The manner in which the cadets dine has not as yet been described in these pages; perhaps here is just as good a place as any to picture the historic mess hall where Lee and Grant and Sherman once dined, and toward which on that Saturday afternoon were marching not only the group we have just left, but also the object of all their dislike, the B. J. plebe who fell in behind the cadets as the battalion swung past barracks. The cadets march to mess hall; they march to every place they go as a company. The building itself is just south of the \"Academic\" and barracks; it is built of gray stone, and forcibly reminds the candid observer of a jail. They tell stories at West Point of credulous candidates who have \"swallowed\" that, and believed that the cadet battalion was composed of disobedient cadets, about to be locked up in confinement. There is a flight of iron steps in the center, and at the foot of these steps, three times every day, the battalion[Pg 205] breaks ranks and dissolves into a mob of actively bounding figures. Upon entering, the cadets do not take seats, but stand behind their chairs, and await the order, \"Company A, take seats!\" \"Company B, take seats!\" and so on. The plebes, who, up to this time, are still a separate company, come last, as usual; they are seated by themselves, at one side of the dining-room. The tables seat twenty-two persons, ten on a side, and one at each end. The cadets are placed according to rank, and they always sit in the same seats. The tables are divided down the center by an imaginary line, each part being a \"table\"; first class men sit near the head, and so on down to the plebes, who find themselves at the center (that is, after they have moved into camp, and been \"sized\" and assigned to companies; before that they are \"beasts,\" herded apart, as has been said). The dinner is upon the table when the cadets enter; the corporals are charged with the duty of carving, and the luckless plebe is expected to help everybody to water upon demand, and eats nothing until that duty has been attended to. After the meal, for which half an hour is allowed, the command, \"Company A, rise!\" and so on, is the signal to leave the table and fall into line again on[Pg 206] the street outside. This, however, does not take place until a lynx-eyed \"tac\" has gone the rounds, making notes—\"So-and-so, too much butter on plate.\" \"Somebody else, napkin not properly folded,\" and so on. This ceremony over, the battalion marches back to camp, a good half mile, in the broiling sun or pouring rain, as the case may be. That Saturday afternoon being a hot one, and a holiday, our friends of the last chapter, Bull Harris and his gang, sought out an occupation in which fully half the cadets at the post chanced to agree; they went in swimming, a diversion which the superintendent sees fit to allow. \"Gee\u0027s Point,\" on the Hudson, is within the government property, and thither the cadets gather whenever the weather is suitable. That particular party included Bull and Baby (who didn\u0027t swim, but liked to watch Bull), Gus Murray, Vance and the rest of their retainers. And, on the way, they passed the time by discussing their one favorite topic, their recent triumph over \"that B. J. beast.\" There was a new phase of the question they had to speculate upon now, and that was what the \"beast\" could possibly have done to move to such unholy wrath so important a per[Pg 207]sonage as the senior captain of the Battalion. Also, they were interested in trying to think up a method by which those extra demerits might be speedily given without incurring the wrath of that officer. Though each one of the yearlings was ready, even anxious, to explain that he wasn\u0027t the least bit afraid of him. \"I tell you,\" declared Bull, \"he couldn\u0027t prove anything against us if he tried. It\u0027s all one great bluff of Fischer\u0027s, and he\u0027s a fool to act as he did.\" \"I\u0027d a good mind to tell him as much!\" assented Baby. \"It won\u0027t make any difference,\" put in Murray, \"we\u0027ll soak the plebe, anyhow. We can easily give him five demerits in short order, and without attracting any attention, either.\" \"He\u0027s out, just as sure as he\u0027s alive!\" laughed Bull. \"We wouldn\u0027t need to do a thing more.\" \"Exactly!\" cried the echo. \"Not a thing!\" \"All the same,\" continued the other, \"I wish we could get up a scheme to get him in disgrace, so as to clinch it. I wish we could——\" Just here Bull was interrupted by a sudden exclamation from Murray. Murray had brought his hand against his[Pg 208] knee with a whack, and there was a look of inspiration upon his face. \"Great C?sar!\" he cried, \"I\u0027ve got it!\" \"Got it! What?\" \"A scheme! A scheme to do him!\" \"What is it?\" \"Write him a letter, or something—get him to leave barracks at night—have a sentry catch him beyond limits, or else we\u0027ll report him absent! Oh, say!\" The crowd were staring at each other in amazement, a look of delight spreading over their faces, as the full possibilities of this same inspiration dawned upon them. \"By the lord!\" cried Bull, at last. \"Court-martial him! That\u0027s the ticket!\" \"Shake on it!\" responded Murray. In half a minute the gang had sworn to put that plan into execution within the space of twenty-four hours. And after that they hurried on down to the point to go in swimming. \"Speak of angels,\" remarked Murray, \"and they flap their wings. There\u0027s the confounded plebe now.\" \"Of angels!\" sneered Vance. \"Of devils, you mean.\" \"By George!\" muttered Bull. \"You can\u0027t phaze that[Pg 209] fellow. I thought he\u0027d be up in barracks, moping, to-day!\" \"Probably wants to put up a bluff as if he don\u0027t care,\" was the clever suggestion of the Baby. \"I bet he\u0027s sore as anything!\" \"I told him I\u0027d make him the sickest plebe in the place,\" growled Bull, \"and I\u0027ll bet he is, too.\" The yearling would have won his bet; there was probably no sadder man in West Point than Mark Mallory just then, even though he did not choose to let his enemies know it. \"Look at him dive!\" sneered Baby, watching him with a malignant frown. \"He wants to show off.\" \"Pretty good dive,\" commented a bystander, who was somewhat more disinterested. \"Good, your grandmother!\" cried the other. \"Why, I could beat that myself if I knew how to swim!\" And then he wondered why the crowd laughed. \"Come on, let\u0027s go in ourselves,\" put in Bull, anxious to end his small friend\u0027s discomfort. \"Hurry up, there!\" The crowd had turned away, to follow their leader in his suggestion; they were by no means anxious to swell the number of those who had gathered for the obvious[Pg 210] purpose of watching Mark Mallory\u0027s feats as a swimmer. In fact, they couldn\u0027t see why anybody should want to watch a B. J. beast, and a \"beast\" who had only a day or two more to stay, at that. Just then, however, a cry from the crowd attracted their attention, and made them turn hastily again. \"A race! A race!\" And Bull Harris cried out with vexation, as he wheeled and took in the situation. \"By the Lord!\" he cried. \"Did you ever hear of such a B. J. trick in your life? The confounded plebe is going to race with Fischer!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88098.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
