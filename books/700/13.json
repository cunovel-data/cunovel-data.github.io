{"id":15811,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. PREPARATIONS FOR THE BATTLE.","content":"It does not take long for news of so exciting a matter as a really important fight to spread among the corps. No sooner did the Parson leave camp than cadets began to stroll in to find out why he had come, and, learning, they hurried off to discuss the news with their own tentmates. So it happened that by the time the cadets marched down to mess hall to supper every man in the battalion knew that Mark Mallory, the B. J. beast, had succeeded in getting another chance at \"Billy\" Williams. The plebes knew of it, too. When their rather ragged and scattered company fell in behind the corps at barracks, they were all talking about it, at least when the file closers weren\u0027t near. At supper nobody talked of anything else, and everybody in the room was eying Mark and his stalwart opponent and speculating as to what the chances would be. \"Billy\u0027ll do him!\" vowed the yearlings. \"There\u0027s nobody in the class that stands more chance.\" [Pg 100]And the plebes feared it would be that way, too, and yet there were a few at the tables discussing the matter in whispers, venturesome enough to say that perhaps maybe their classmate might win and to wonder what on earth would happen to him if he did. \"It\u0027ll mean a revelation if he does!\" they cried. \"Perhaps it\u0027ll even stop hazing.\" The mood of the irate little corporal, who had vowed not an hour before that Mallory should not have another chance, may well be imagined. \"I tell you, \u0027tis a shame!\" he vowed to Williams. \"A shame! I don\u0027t see why in thunder you didn\u0027t hold out.\" \"It\u0027s not my fault, Jasper,\" responded the other, smiling good naturedly. \"If you\u0027ll think a while, you\u0027ll see he was in a position to force a fight at any time he chose. If I refused to \u0027allow him to threaten to hit me,\u0027 as he put it, he could have threatened anyway, and then if that didn\u0027t do any good, he\u0027d have actually to hit me, and there you would have been. It\u0027s a great deal better this way.\" \"Yes!\" growled Jasper. \"That sounds all very well. But look where it puts me, by George! You\u0027ll have to get somebody else to arrange it. I won\u0027t. I went as a committee and told him he\u0027d not get another chance, and[Pg 101] I tell you now I\u0027ll not go take it back for anybody, and with that B. J. plebe especially.\" \"Perhaps he won\u0027t be so very B. J. after the fight,\" responded the other, smiling. \"I don\u0027t know, of course, but I shall do my best.\" \"If you don\u0027t,\" said the other, looking serious, \"by jingo! we\u0027ll be in a thundering fix. There\u0027s nobody in the class can beat you, and that plebe\u0027ll have a walkover.\" This last sentiment of Jasper\u0027s was the sentiment of the whole yearling class, and the class was in a state of uncertainty in consequence. Texas was known to have whipped four cadets in one morning, and all of them good men, too; then there was a rumor out that Mark and Texas had had a quarrel and that the latter had gone to the hospital some five minutes later. The two facts put together were enough to make the most confident do some thinking. It is difficult for one who has never been to West Point to appreciate what this state of affairs meant—because it is hard for him to appreciate the relation which exists between the plebe and the rest of the corps. From the moment of the former\u0027s arrival as an alarmed and trembling candidate, it is the especial business of every cadet to[Pg 102] teach him that he is the most utterly, entirely and absolutely insignificant individual upon the face of the universe. He is shouted at and ordered, bullied, badgered, tormented, pulled and hauled, drilled and laughed at until he is reduced to the state of mind of a rabbit. If he is \"B. J.\" about it, he is bullied the more; if he shows fight, he has all he wants, and is made meeker still. The result of it all is that he learns to do just as anybody else commands him, and Never dares to sneeze unless He\u0027s asked you if he might. All of which is fun for the yearling. Now, here was Mark Mallory—to say nothing of Texas—who had come up to the Point with an absurd notion of his own dignity, who had outwitted the yearlings at every turn, been sent to Coventry—and didn\u0027t care a hang, and now was on the point of trying to \"lick\" the finest all-around athlete in the whole third class. It was enough to make the corps tremble—the yearlings, at any rate. The first class usually feels too dignified to meddle with such things. Billy Williams\u0027 ambassador put in an appearance on the following Sunday morning, and, to Mark\u0027s disgust,[Pg 103] he proved to be none other than his old enemy, Bull Harris—sent, by the way, not because Williams so chose, but because Bull himself had asked to be sent. \"Mr. Williams,\" said he, \"says he\u0027ll give you another chance to run away.\" Mark bowed politely, determined that Harris should get as little chance for insult as possible. \"He\u0027ll fight you to-morrow—Fort Clinton, at four, and if you don\u0027t come, by thunder! he\u0027ll find out why.\" Mark\u0027s face grew white, but he only bowed again, and swallowed it. And just then came an unexpected interruption. \"Mr. Mallory, as the challenged party, has the right to name the time.\" The voice was loud and clear, and seemed to have authority; Harris turned and confronted Cadet First Captain Fischer, in all his glory of chevrons and sword. Now, the first captain is lord of West Point—and Harris didn\u0027t dare to say a word, though he was boiling within. \"And, moreover,\" continued the imposing young officer, angrily, \"you should remember that you came, Mr.[Pg 104] Harris, as a gentleman and not as a combatant. Mr. Mallory, what is your wish?\" \"The time suits me,\" said Mark, quietly. \"Good-day, Mr. Harris.\" And Harris left in a very unpleasant mood indeed; he had meant to have no end of amusement at the expense of Mark\u0027s feelings. \"You\u0027ve a hard row to hoe,\" said the cadet officer to Mark, \"and a hard man to beat. And you were foolish to get into it, but, all the same, I\u0027ll see that you have fair play.\" \"And that,\" exclaimed Texas to Mark, as he watched the tall, erect figure of the cadet vanish through the sally port. \"That is the first decent word I\u0027ve heard from a cadet since I\u0027ve been here. Bully for Fischer!\" \"It\u0027s probable,\" said Mark, \"that he knows Harris as well as we. And now, old fellow,\" he added, \"we\u0027ve got nothing to do but pass time, and wait—and wait for to-morrow morning!\" Mark slept soundly that night in spite of the excitement. It was Texas who was restless, for Texas had promised to act as alarm clock, and, realizing that not to be on time again would be a calamity indeed, he was up[Pg 105] half a dozen times to gaze out of the window toward the eastern sky, watching for the first signs of morning. While it was yet so dark that he could scarcely see the clock, he routed Mark out of bed. \"Git up thar,\" he whispered, \"git up an\u0027 git ready.\" Mark \"got,\" and the two dressed hurriedly and crept down the stairs, past the sentry—the sentry was a cadet, and kindly \"looked the other way\"—and then went out through the sally port to the parade ground. The plain was shrouded in mist and darkness, and the stars still shone, though there was a faint light in the east. The two stole past the camp—where also the sentries were blind—scaled the ramparts, and stood in the center of \"old Fort Clinton.\" The spot was deserted and silent, but scarcely had the two been there a moment before a head peered over the wall nearest to the camp. \"They\u0027re here,\" whispered a cadet, and sprang over. A dozen others followed him, and in a very few minutes more there were at least thirty of them, excited and eager, waiting for \"Billy\" to put in an appearance. It was not long before Billy came, and behind him his faithful chum, Jasper, with a bucket of water, and sponges and towels[Pg 106] enough for a dozen. About the same time Stanard\u0027s long shanks appeared over the breastworks, and Indian tumbled over a moment later. Things were about ready then. \"Let\u0027s lose no time,\" said Jasper, always impatient. \"Captain Fischer will act as referee and timekeeper, if it\u0027s agreeable.\" No one could have suited Mark more, and he said so. Likewise, he stated, through his second, Mr. Powers, that he preferred to fight by rounds, which evidently pleased Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams was by this time stripped to the waist, his suspenders tied about him. And it was evidently as Fischer had said. There was no finer man in his class, and he was trained to perfection. His skin was white and glistening, his shoulders broad and massive, and the muscles on his arms stood out with every motion. His legs were probably as muscular, too, thought Mark, for Williams held the record for the mile. The yearlings\u0027 hearts beat higher as they gazed at their champion\u0027s determined face. Mark was a little slower in stepping up; when he did so the watching crowd sized him up carefully, and then there was doubt. [Pg 107]\"Oh, gee, but this is going to be a fight!\" was the verdict of every one of them. \"Marquis of Queensberry rules,\" said Fischer, in a low tone. \"Both know them?\" Mark nodded. \"Shake hands!\" Mark put out his, by way of answer, and Williams gripped it right heartily. \"Ready?\" And then the simple word \"Go.\" Let us gaze about a moment at the scene. The ring is surrounded by earthworks, now grass-grown and trodden down, unkept since the Revolutionary days, when West Point was a Gibraltar. Old cannon, caissons and wagon wheels are scattered about inside, together with ramparts and wire chevaux-de-friezes which the cadets are practiced in constructing. In the southwest corner is a small, clear, smooth-trodden space, where the two brawny, white-skinned warriors stand. The cadets are forming a ring about them, for every one is too excited to sit down and keep quiet. The \"outlooks,\" posted for safety, are neglecting their duty recklessly for the same[Pg 108] reason, and looking in altogether. Every eye is on the two. Over in Mark\u0027s corner sits Texas, gripping his hands in excitement, wriggling nervously and muttering to himself. Stanard is beside him with \"Dana\u0027s Geology\" as a cushion. The Parson is a picture of calm and scholarly dignity, in direct contrast with our friend Texas, who is on the verge of one of his wild \"fits.\" \"Indian\" is the fourth and only other plebe present, and Indian is horrified, as usual, and mutters \"Bless my soul\" at intervals. On the opposite side of the circle of cadets are Jasper and another second, both breathlessly watching every move. Nearby stands Cadet Captain Fischer, calm and cool, critically watching the play. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88086.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
