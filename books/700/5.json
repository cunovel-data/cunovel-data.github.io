{"id":15803,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. MARK IN DISGRACE.","content":"\"In my excursions into the various fields of knowledge I have never yet had occasion to investigate the alleged discoveries of phrenological experimentalists, and yet——\" The speaker paused for a moment, long enough to sigh mournfully. Then he continued: \"And yet I had, I think, sufficient perception of character as delineated by the outlines of physiognomy to recognize at once the fact that the person to whom we refer is in no way a coward.\" \"I wish I had, Parson,\" responded his companion, ruefully rubbing a large lump upon his forehead. \"I wish I had.\" The thin, learned features of the first speaker found it difficult to indicate any amusement, and yet there was the trace of a smile about his mouth as he answered. \"You say he \u0027licked\u0027 you, to use your own rather unclassic phrase?\" he inquired. [Pg 47]\"Licked me? Wow! He gave me, sah, the very worst lickin\u0027 I ever got in my life—which is very natural, seeing that when a feller gits licked down in Texas they bury him afterward. I reckon I\u0027d be a gunnin\u0027 fo\u0027 him right now, if \u0027twarn\u0027t seein\u0027 it\u0027s Mark Mallory. Why, man, a feller can\u0027t stay mad with Mark Mallory long!\" It was just dinner time and Parson and Texas were sitting on the steps of barracks, waiting for the summons and talking over the events of the previous day. \"And how did this encounter originate?\" inquired the Parson. \"All in my foolishness!\" growled Texas. \"You see yesterday morning when he didn\u0027t turn up to fight that \u0027ere yearling fellow Williams, I thought \u0027twas cause he was scared. An\u0027 so I got mad an\u0027 when he did turn up I went fo\u0027 him. An\u0027 then I went fo\u0027 the hospital.\" \"His conduct did seem unaccountable,\" rejoined the other. \"And yet somehow I had an instinctive intuition, so to speak, that there was an adequate reason. And one is apt to find that such impressions are trustworthy, as, indeed, was most obviously demonstrated and consistently maintained by the German philosopher, Immanuel Kant.[Pg 48] Are you acquainted with Kant\u0027s antinomies?\" the Parson added, anxiously. \"No,\" said Powers. \"I ain\u0027t. They ain\u0027t got to Texas yit. But I wish I\u0027d had more sense\u0027n to git mad with Mark. I tell you I felt cheap when he did explain. I kain\u0027t tell you the reason yit, but you\u0027ll know it before long. All I kin say is he went down to Cranston\u0027s.\" \"To Cranston\u0027s? I thought we weren\u0027t allowed off the grounds.\" \"We ain\u0027t. But he took the risk of expulsion.\" \"And another, too,\" put in the Parson, \"the risk of being called a coward an\u0027 being ostracised by the cadets.\" \"I dunno \u0027bout the astercizin\u0027 part,\" said Texas, \"but I know they called him a coward, an\u0027 I know they cut him dead. There won\u0027t even a plebe speak to him, \u0027cept me an\u0027 you an\u0027 Injun. An\u0027 it\u0027s what I call durnation tough now, by Jingo!\" \"It don\u0027t worry me very much,\" put in a voice behind them. The two turned and saw Mark looking at them with an amused expression. \"It don\u0027t worry me much,\" he repeated. \"I guess I[Pg 49] can stand it if you\u0027ll stand by me. And I think pretty soon I can get another chance at Williams, and then——\" \"If ye do,\" cried the excitable Texan, springing up, \"I\u0027ll back you to murder him in jist about half a minute.\" \"It won\u0027t be so easy,\" responded Mark, \"for Williams is the best man in his class, and that\u0027s saying a great deal. But I\u0027ll try it; and in the meantime we\u0027ll face out the disgrace. I can stand it, for really there isn\u0027t much privation when you have three to keep you company.\" \"I reckon,\" put in Texas, after a moment\u0027s thought, \"I reckon we\u0027ll have to put off aformin\u0027 o\u0027 thet ere new organization we were a-talkin\u0027 \u0027bout. Cuz we kain\u0027t git anybody to join ef they won\u0027t any of \u0027em speak to us.\" \"I guess we three are enough for the present,\" said Mark, \"at least while all the cadets leave us alone. And if they try to haze us I think we can fight about as well as the rest of them. Then there\u0027s Indian, too, you know; I don\u0027t think he can fight much, but he\u0027s——\" \"Now, see here!\" cried an indignant voice from the doorway, \"now see here, you fellows! I think that\u0027s real mean, now, indeed I do. Didn\u0027t I tell you fellows I was going to learn to fight?\" he expostulated. \"Didn\u0027t I? Bless my soul, now, what more can a man do?\" [Pg 50]Mark winked slyly to his companions, and put on his most solemn air. \"Do?\" he growled. \"You ask what more can a man do? A man might, if he were a man, rise up and prove his prowess and win himself a name. He might gird up his loins and take his sword in his hand and sally forth, to vindicate his honor and the honor of his sworn friends and allies. That is what he might do. And instead what does he do? In slothfulness and cowardice he sits and suffers beneath the rod of tyranny and oppression!\" Mark finished out of breath and red in the face. \"Bless my soul!\" cried Indian. \"Such a course is by no means entirely unprecedented,\" put in Stanard, solemnly. \"It is common in the mythology of antiquity and in the legends of medi?val times. Such was the course of Hercules, and thus did Sir Galahad and the Knights of the Round Table.\" Poor Joe Smith was gazing at the two speakers in perplexity. He wasn\u0027t quite sure whether they were serious or not, but he thought they were, and he was on the verge of promising to go out and kill something, whether a cadet or a grizzly, at once. The only trouble was that the tall, sedate-looking officer of the day, in his spotless uni[Pg 51]form of gray and white and gold with a dazzling red sash thrown in, strode out of the guardhouse just then; a moment later came the cry, \"New cadets turn out!\" and Indian drew a breath of relief at being delivered from his uncomfortable situation. Saturday afternoon is a holiday at West Point. The luckless plebe, having been drilled and shouted at for a week, gets a much-needed chance to do as he pleases, with the understanding, of course, that he does not happen to fall into the hands of the yearlings. If he does, he does as they please, instead. Saturday afternoon is also a holiday time for the yearling, too, and he is accustomed to amuse himself with variety shows and concerts, recitations and exhibition drills, continuous performances that are free, given by the \"beasts,\" the \"trained animals,\" or plebes. It may be well at the start to have a word to say about \"hazing\" at West Point. Hazing is abolished there, so people say. At any rate, there are stringent measures taken to prevent it. A cadet is forbidden in any way to lay hands upon the plebe; he is forbidden to give any degrading command or exact any menial service; and the penalty for breaking these rules is dismissal. The plebe[Pg 52] is called up daily before the tactical officer in charge of his company, and asked if he has any complaint to make. Such are the methods. The results are supposed to be a complete stopping of \"deviling\" in all its forms. The actual result has been that when a yearling wants to \"lay hands upon the plebe\" he does it on the sly—perhaps \"yanks\" him, as one peculiar form of nocturnal torture is termed. When the yearling wants some work done, instead of \"commanding\" he \"requests,\" and with the utmost politeness. If he wants his gun cleaned he kindly offers to \"show\" the plebe how to do it—taking care to see that the showing is done on his own gun and not on the plebe\u0027s. And the plebe is not supposed to object. He may, but in that case there are other methods. If he reports anybody he is ostracised—\"cut\" by every one, his own class included. This being the case, we come to the events of this particular Saturday afternoon. \"There were three wily yearlings Set out one summer\u0027s day To hunt the plebe so timid In barracks far away.\" Only in this case there were half a dozen instead of three. [Pg 53]Now, of all the persons selected for torment that year, with the possible exception of Mark and Texas, the two \"B. J.\u0027s,\" Indian was the most prominent. \"Indian,\" as he was now called by the whole corps, was a rara avis among plebes, being an innocent, gullible person who believed implicitly everything that was told him, and could be scared to death by a word. It was Indian that this particular crowd of merry yearlings set out to find. Mark and Texas, it chanced, had gone out for a walk; \"Parson\" Stanard had, wandered over to the library building to \"ascertain the extent of their geological literature,\" and to get some information, if possible, about a most interesting question which was just then troubling him. And poor Joe Smith was all alone in his room, dreading some visitation of evil. The laughing crowd dashed up the steps and burst into the room. Indian had been told what to do. \"Heels together, turn out your toes, hands by your sides, palms to the front, fingers closed, little fingers on the seams of the trousers, head up, chin in, shoulders thrown back, chest out. Here, you! Get that scared look off your face. Whacher \u0027fraid of. If you don\u0027t stop looking scared I\u0027ll murder you on the spot!\" [Pg 54]And with preliminary introduction the whole crowd got at him at once. \"Can you play the piano? Go ahead, then. What! Haven\u0027t got any? Why didn\u0027t you bring one? What\u0027s the use of being able to play the piano if you haven\u0027t a piano? Can you recite? Don\u0027t know anything? You look like it. Here, take this paper—it\u0027s a song. Learn it now! Why don\u0027t you learn it? What do you mean by staring at me instead of at the paper? There, that\u0027s right. Now sing the first six verses. Don\u0027t know \u0027em yet? Bah, what will you do when you come to trigonometry with a hundred and fourteen formulas to learn every night? Have you learned to stand on your head yet? What! Didn\u0027t I tell you to do it? Who taught you to stand on your feet, anyhow? Why don\u0027t you answer me, eh? Let\u0027s see you get up on that mantelpiece. Won\u0027t hold you? Well, who said it would? What\u0027s that got to do with it? No! Don\u0027t take that chair. Vault up! There. Now flap your wings. What! Haven\u0027t got any? What kind of an angel are you, anyhow? Flap your ears. Let\u0027s hear you crow like a hen. Hens don\u0027t crow? What do you know about hens, anyway? Were you ever a hen? Well, why weren\u0027t you?[Pg 55] Were you ever a goose, then? No? Well, you certainly look like it! Why don\u0027t you crow when we tell you? What kind of crowing is that—flap your arms, there. Have you got any toothpicks? What! No toothpicks? Don\u0027t suppose you have any teeth, either. Oh, so you have toothpicks, have you? Well, why did you say you didn\u0027t? Take \u0027em out of your pockets and row yourself along that mantelpiece with \u0027em. \u0027Fraid you\u0027ll fall off, eh? Well, we\u0027ll put you up again. Humpty Dumpty! Row fast now! Row! Get that grin off your face. How dare you smile at a higher classman! You are the most amazingly presumptuous beast that I ever heard of. Get down now, and don\u0027t break any bones about it, either!\" All these amazing orders, rattled off in a breath, and interspersed with a variety of comment and ejaculation, poor Indian obeyed in fear and trembling. He was commanded to fall down, and he fell; he was commanded to fall up, and he protested that the law of gravitation——\"Bah! why don\u0027t you get the law repealed?\" He wiped off a smile from his terrified face and threw it under the bed. Then, gasping, spluttering, he went under and got it. He strove his very best to go to sleep, amid a variety[Pg 56] of suggestions, such as which eyes to shut and which lung to breathe through. This went on till the ingenuity of the cadets was nearly exhausted. Then one individual, more learned than the rest, chanced to learn the identity of the Indian\u0027s name with that of the great Mormon leader. And instantly he elbowed his way to the front. \"Look here, sir, who told you to be a Mormon? You\u0027re not a Mormon? Got only one wife, hey? None? Then what sort of a Mormon are you? Why have you got a Mormon\u0027s name? Did you steal it? Don\u0027t you know who Joseph Smith was? No? Not you, the great Joseph Smith! Suppose you think you\u0027re the great Joseph Smith. Well, now, how on earth did you ever manage to get into this academy without knowing who Joseph Smith was? Didn\u0027t ask you that, you say? Well, they should have! Fellow-citizens and cadets, did you ever hear of such a thing? There must be some mistake here. The very idea of letting a dunce like that in? Why, I knew who Joseph Smith was about seventy-five years ago. Gentlemen, I move you that we carry this case to the academy board at once. I shall use my influence to have this man expelled. I never heard of such a pre[Pg 57]posterous outrage in my life! Not know Joseph Smith! And he\u0027s too fat to be a cadet, anyhow. What do you say?\" \"Come ahead! Come ahead!\" cried the rest of the mob, indignant and solemn. And almost before the poor Indian could realize what they were doing, or going to do, the whole crowd arose gravely and marched in silence out of the room, bent upon their direful mission of having the Army Board expel Indian because he had never heard of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet. And Indian swallowed every bit of it and sat and trembled for his life. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88078.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
