The fellow\u0027s a coward, and he don\u0027t deserve the chance.\" And Cadet Corporal Jasper brought his fist down on the table with a bang. \"No, sir,\" he repeated. \"I wouldn\u0027t think of it!\" \"But he wants to fight!\" exclaimed the other. \"Well, he had a chance once; why didn\u0027t he fight then? That\u0027s what I want to know, and that\u0027s what he won\u0027t tell us. And as far as I\u0027m concerned Mallory shall lie in the bed he\u0027s made. I wouldn\u0027t honor him with another chance.\" It was an afternoon late in June, and the two speakers were discussing some ice cream at \"the Dutchwoman\u0027s\" and waiting for the call to quarters before dress parade. \"If that fellow,\" continued Corporal Jasper, \"had any reason on earth for getting up at midnight, dodging sentry and running out of barracks, to stay till reveille, except to avoid fighting you that morning, now, by jingo! I[Pg 82] want to know what it is! The class sent me to ask him, and he simply said he wouldn\u0027t tell, that\u0027s all. His bluff about wanting another chance won\u0027t work.\" \"Well, if we don\u0027t,\" protested Williams, the other man, a tall, finely-built fellow, \"if we don\u0027t, he\u0027ll go right on getting fresh, won\u0027t he?\" \"No, sir, he won\u0027t! We\u0027ll find a way to stop him. In the first place, he\u0027s been sent to Coventry. Not a man in the academy\u0027ll speak to him; he may not mind that for a while, but I think he won\u0027t brave it out very long. Just you watch and see.\" \"The only trouble with that,\" said Williams, \"is that he\u0027s not cut by all the fellows. I\u0027ve seen three of the plebes with him.\" \"What!\" cried the other, in amazement. \"Who?\" \"Well, there\u0027s that fellow he seconded in the fight——\" \"Texas, you mean?\" \"Yes, Texas. Then that long-legged scarecrow Stanard was out walking with him this very day. And I saw that goose they call the Indian talking to him at dinner, and before the whole plebe class, too.\" \"Well, now, by jingo! they\u0027ll find it costs something to defy the corps!\" exclaimed Jasper. \"It\u0027s a pretty state of[Pg 83] affairs, indeed, if three or four beasts can come up here and run this place as they please. They\u0027ll find when an order\u0027s given here they\u0027ll obey, or else they can chase themselves home in a hurry. That fellow Mallory must be a fool! There\u0027s never been a plebe at this academy\u0027s dared to do half what he\u0027s done.\" \"That\u0027s why I think it would be best to lick him. I\u0027m not sure I can do it, you know, but I think it would be best to try.\" \"That fellow started out to be B. J. at the very start,\" growled the excitable corporal, after a moment\u0027s thought. \"Right at the very start! \u0027Baby\u0027 Edwards was telling me the other day how way last year this fellow met with an accident—fell off the express or something—and while he was staying down at the Falls Baby and a couple of other fellows thought he was a candidate, and started in to haze him. He was sassy as you please then. And after that he went out West, where he lives, and did some extraordinary thing—saved an express, I believe, and sent in an account to a paper for a lot of money. Of course that got him dead stuck on himself, and then he goes and wins a cadetship here and thinks he can run the earth. He[Pg 84] was so deucedly B. J. he had to go and lock Edwards and Bull Harris in an icehouse down near the Falls!\" \"You see what\u0027s happened now,\" he continued, after a moment\u0027s pause. \"Your challenge brought him up with a round turn, and he saw his bluff was stopped. He was afraid to fight, and so he hid, that\u0027s all. But, by jingo, he\u0027ll pay for it if I\u0027ve got anything to say in the matter!\" And the little corporal made the dishes on the table rattle. Corporal Jasper and Cadet Williams had finished their council and their ice cream by this time, and arose to go just as the roll of drum was heard from \"Camp McPherson.\" The two strolled off in the direction of the summons, Jasper just as positive and vehement as ever. \"You shan\u0027t fight him,\" he declared. \"And if sending him to Coventry doesn\u0027t do any good, we\u0027ll find some other way, that\u0027s all! And we\u0027ll keep at him till he learns how to behave himself if it takes the whole summer to do it.\" This was the young cadet officer\u0027s parting vow, as he turned and entered his tent. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88083.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
