{"id":15816,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. TO THE RESCUE.","content":"Things happened in a whirl of confusion after that. To the horrified cadets a thousand incidents seemed to crowd in at one moment. In the first place there was the terrified captive, bound helplessly to the tree, his clothing on fire, himself shrieking at the top of his lungs. Then there were the yearlings themselves, all crying out with fright and alarm and rushing wildly in to drag the burning wood away. Finally there were other arrivals, whom, in the excitement, the yearlings scarcely noticed. There were two of them; one tore a knife from his pocket and cut the rope in a dozen places, the other flung off his jacket and wrapped it quickly about Indian\u0027s feet, extinguishing the flames. And then the two stood up and gazed at the rest—the frightened yearlings and their infuriated victim. Infuriated? Yes, wildly infuriated! A change had come over Indian such as no one who knew him had ever[Pg 147] seen before. The fire had not really hurt him; it had only ruined his clothing and scorched his legs enough to make him wild with rage. He had tugged at his bonds savagely; when he was cut free he had torn loose from the friendly stranger who had knelt to extinguish the fire, and made a savage rush at the badly scared cadets. Indian\u0027s face was convulsed with passion. His arms were swinging wildly like a windmill\u0027s sails in a hurricane, while from his mouth rushed a volley of exclamations that would have frightened Captain Kidd and his pirate band. It made no difference what he hit; the fat boy was too blind with rage to see. He must hit something! If a tree had lain in his path he would have started in on that. As luck would have it, however, the thing that was nearest to him was a yearling—Baby Edwards. Baby could have been no more frightened if he had seen an express train charging on him. He turned instantly and fled—where else would he flee but to his idol Bull? He hid behind that worthy; Bull put up his hands to defend himself; and the next instant Indian\u0027s flying arms reached the spot. One savage blow on the nose sent Bull tumbling back[Pg 148]ward—over Baby. Indian, of course, could not stop and so did a somersault over the two. There was a pretty mêlée after that. Baby was the first to emerge, covered with dirt and bruises. Indian got up second; he gazed about him, his rage still burning; he gave one snort, shook his head clear of the soil as an angry bull might; and then made another savage rush at Baby. Baby this time had no friend to hide behind; Harris was lying on the ground, face down, as a man might do to protect himself in a cyclone. And so Baby had no resource but flight; he took to his heels, the enraged plebe a few feet behind; and in half a minute more the pair were lost to sight and sound, far distant in the woods, Indian still pursuing. It might be pleasant to follow them, for Indian in his rage was a sight to divert the gods. But there was plenty more happening at the scene of the fire, things that ought not be missed. In the first place, who were the two new arrivals? It was evident that they were plebes—their faces were familiar to the cadets. But beyond that no one knew anything about them. They had freed their helpless classmate and saved him from serious injury, as has been told.[Pg 149] They had done one thing more that has not been mentioned yet. One of them, the smaller, just after Indian had broken loose, had reached over and dealt the nearest yearling he could reach a ringing blow upon the cheek. \"Take that!\" said he. \"Bah Jove, you\u0027re a cur.\" There was another mêlée after that. Of course the setting fire to Indian had been a pure accident; but the two strangers did not know it. They saw in the whole thing a piece of diabolical cruelty. The yearling the wrath chanced to fall upon was Gus Murray—and his anger is left to the imagination. He sprang at the throat of the reckless plebe; and the rest of the crowd rushed to his aid, pausing just for an instant to size up the pair. They did not seem \"to be any great shucks.\" The taller was a big slouchy-looking chap in clothes that evidently bespoke the farmer, and possessing a drawl which quite as clearly indicated the situation of the farm—the prairies. Having cut Indian loose he was lounging lazily against the tree and regarding his more excitable companion with a good-natured grin. The companion was even less awe-inspiring, for one had to look at him but an instant to see that he was one[Pg 150] of the creatures whom all well-regulated boys despise—a dude. He wore a high collar, ridiculously high; he was slender and delicate looking, with the correct Fifth Avenue stoop to his shoulders and an attitude to his arms which showed that he had left his cane behind only on compulsion when he \"struck the Point.\" And any doubts the yearlings may have had on this question were settled as the yearlings stared, for the object turned to the other and spoke. \"Aw say, Sleepy,\" said he, \"come help me chastise these fellows, don\u0027t ye know.\" As a fact there was but little choice in the matter, it was fight or die with the two, for at the same instant Gus Murray, wild with rage, had leaped forward and made a savage lunge at the dude. What happened then Murray never quite knew. All he made out was that when he hit at the dude the dude suddenly ceased to be there. The yearling glanced around in surprise and discovered that his victim had slid coolly under his elbow and was standing over on the other side of the clearing—smiling. The rest of the crowd, not in the least daunted by Murray\u0027s miss, rushed in to the attack; and a moment later[Pg 151] a wild scrimmage was in progress, a scrimmage which defied the eye to comprehend and the pen to describe. The former never moved from the tree, but with his back flat against it and his great clumsy arms swinging like sledge hammers he stood and bid defiance to his share of the crowd. The dude\u0027s tactics were just the opposite. He was light and slender, and should have been easy prey. That was what Bull Harris thought as he hastily arose from the spot where Indian had butted him and joined his eager comrades in the hunt. The hunt; a hunt it was, and no mistake. While the farmer stayed in one place, the dude seemed everywhere at once. Dodging, ducking, running, he seemed just to escape every blow that was aimed at him. He seemed even to turn somersaults, to the amazed yearlings, who had been looking for a dude and not an acrobat. The dude did not dodge all the time, though; occasionally he would stop to cool the ardor of some especially excited cadet with a sudden punch where it wasn\u0027t looked for. Once also he stuck out his foot and allowed Bull Harris to get his legs caught in it, with a result that Bull\u0027s nose once more plowed the clearing. [Pg 152]The writer wishes it were his privilege to chronicle the fact that the two put the eight to flight; or that Indian, having put the Baby \"to sleep,\" returned to perform yet greater prodigies of valor. It would be a pleasure to tell of all that, but on the other hand truth is a stubborn thing. Things do not always happen as they should in spite of the providence that is supposed to make them. The farmer, after a five-minute gallant stand, was finally knocked down—from behind—and once down he was being fast pummeled into nothingness. The dude—his collar, much to his alarm, having wilted—was in the last stage of exhaustion. In fact, Bull had succeeded in landing a blow, the first of the afternoon for him. The dude was about to give up and perish, when assistance arrived. For these gallant heroes were not fated to conquer alone. The first warning of the arrival of reinforcements was not the traditional trumpet call, nor the roll of a drum, nor even the tramp of soldiers, but a muttered \"Wow!\" This was followed by Texas himself, bursting through the bushes like a battering ram. Mark was at his side, and behind them came the Parson. Dewey, being rather crippled, brought up the rear. [Pg 153]The four lost no time in questions; they saw two plebes in distress, and they had met Indian on the warpath and learned the cause of the trouble. They knew it was their business to help and they \"sailed right in\" to do it. Mark placed himself by the side of the panting \"dude.\" Texas and the Parson made a V formation and speedily got the farmer to his feet and in fighting array once more. And after that the odds of the battle were more even. It was a very brief battle, in fact. A mere skirmish after that. Mark\u0027s prowess was dreaded, and that of Texas but little less. After Texas had chased two yearlings into the woods, and Mark had stretched out Bull—that was Bull\u0027s third time that afternoon—the ardor of the eight began to wane. It was not very long then before the attack stopped by mutual consent, and the combatants took to staring at each other instead. The rage of Bull as he picked himself up and examined his damages must be imagined. \"You confounded plebes shall pay for this,\" he roared, \"as sure as I\u0027m alive.\" \"Now?\" inquired Mark, smiling, rubbing his hands, and looking ready to resume hostilities. [Pg 154]\"It\u0027s a case of blamed swelled head, that\u0027s what it is,\" growled the other, sullenly. \"Which,\" added the Parson\u0027s solemn voice, \"might be somewhat more classically expressed by the sesquipedalian Hellenic vocable—ahem!—Megalacephalomania.\" With which interesting bit of information—presented gratis—the Parson carefully laid his beloved \"Dana\" on the ground and sat down on it for safety. \"Why can\u0027t you plebes mind your business, anyhow?\" snarled Gus Murray. \"That\u0027s what I say, too!\" cried Bull. \"Curious coincidence!\" laughed Dewey. \"Reminds me of a story I once heard, b\u0027gee—I guess it\u0027s most too long a story to tell through. Remind me of it, Mark, and I\u0027ll tell it to you some day. One of the most remarkable tales I ever heard, that! Told me by a fellow that used to run a sausage factory. It was right next door to a \"Home for Homeless Cats,\" though, b\u0027gee, I couldn\u0027t ever see how the cats were homeless if they had a home there. They didn\u0027t stay very long, though. That was the funniest part of it. They used to sit on the fence near the sausage factory, b\u0027gee——\" Dewey could have prattled on that way till doomsday[Pg 155] with unfailing good humor. It made the yearlings mad and that was all he cared about. But by this time Bull had perceived that he was being guyed, and he turned away with an angry exclamation. \"You fellows may stay if you choose;\" he said, \"I\u0027m going back to camp. And those plebes shall pay for this!\" \"Cash on demand!\" laughed Mark, as the discomfited crowd turned and slunk off. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88091.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
