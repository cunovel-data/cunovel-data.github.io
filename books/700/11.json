{"id":15809,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI. DISADVANTAGES OF \"COVENTRY.\"","content":"\"Sir, the parade is formed!\" Thus spoke the cadet adjutant as he approached the lieutenant in command, and a moment later, at the word, the battalion swung around and marched across the campus. It was the evening dress parade of perhaps the best drilled body of troops in the country, and West Point was out in holiday attire to see it. Seated on the benches beneath the trees on the western edge of the parade ground was a crowd of spectators—visitors at the post and nearly the whole plebe class besides. For this was Saturday afternoon holiday, and the \"beasts\" had turned out in a body to witness the performance of what they were all hoping some day to be. It was a \"mighty fine\" performance, and one that made those same beasts open their eyes with amazement. Spotless and glittering in their uniforms were the cadets, and they went through all manner of difficult evolutions in perfect unison, marching with lines as straight and even[Pg 86] as the eye could wish. It is a pretty sight, a mass of gray in a setting of deep green—the trees that encircle the spot, and it made the poor homesick \"beasts\" take a little interest in life once more. Among these \"beasts\" were Mark and Texas. They sat under the trees a little apart from the crowd and watched the scene with interest. Mark had seen dress parades before; Texas had not, and he stared with open eyes and mouth, giving vent to an exclamation of amazement and delight at intervals. \"Look a\u0027 yere, Mark,\" he cried, \"d\u0027you think we\u0027ll ever be able do that a\u0027 way. Honest, now? I think I\u0027ll stay!\" \"Even after you get through fightin?\" laughed Mark. \"I don\u0027t think I want to fight any more,\" growled Texas, looking glum. \"Since you an\u0027 me fit, somehow fightin\u0027 ain\u0027t so much fun.\" \"What\u0027s the fun o\u0027 fightin\u0027 ef you git licked?\" he added, after a moment\u0027s thought. \"I never tried it,\" said the other, laughing. \"But I suppose you\u0027ll be real meek now and let them haze you.\" \"Yaas!\" drawled Texas, grinning. \"Yes, I will! Them ole cadets git after me, now, by jingo, I\u0027ll go out[Pg 87] there an\u0027 yank some of \u0027em out that parade an\u0027 lick them all t\u0027once. But say! look at that chap on a horse.\" \"That chap\u0027s the commandant,\" said Mark, \"and he\u0027s going to review the parade for a change.\" \"I wish I was in it,\" exclaimed Texas, \"an\u0027 I wish I knew all that rigamarole they\u0027re doin\u0027 now\"—that \"rigamarole\" being the manual-at-arms. \"I jest believe if I had somebody to teach me \u0027cept that \u0027ere yellin\u0027 tomcat of a Cadet Spencer I\u0027d learn in a jiffy, dog on his boots!\" \"There he is now,\" said Mark, \"in the second line there. And there on the outside with his chevrons is Corporal Jasper, \u0027the committee.\u0027 They look very different when they\u0027re in line.\" \"Nothin\u0027 \u0027d make that red-headed, freckle-faced coyote of a drill-master look different,\" growled Texas. \"I jes\u0027 wish he was bigger\u0027n me so\u0027s I could git up a scrap with him. Jest think o\u0027 that little martinet a yellin\u0027 at me an\u0027 tellin\u0027 me I didn\u0027t have any sense. To-day, for instance, d\u0027you remember, he was tryin\u0027 to show Indian how to march an\u0027 move his legs, an\u0027 Indian got twisted up into a knot; an\u0027 durnation, jist because I laughed, why he rared round an\u0027 bucked fo\u0027 an hour! What\u0027s the harm in laughing, anyhow?\" [Pg 88]And Texas glared so savagely at his tormentor as the line swept by just then that Mark concluded there was no harm and laughed. \"You\u0027re getting to be very stupid company, Texas,\" said he. \"You never do anything but growl at the cadets. I wish I had some diversion.\" And Mark turned away in mock disgust and glanced down the archway of trees. \"Here she comes,\" he said, after a moment\u0027s pause. \"That\u0027s she walking up the path with a cadet and another girl.\" Texas turned as Mark spoke, and looked in the direction of his nod. \"So that\u0027s Mary Adams!\" he exclaimed. \"Well! well! That\u0027s the girl you dodged barracks for, and risked your commission, and missed the fight, and got called a coward, and sent to Coventry, and lots else. I swear!\" \"That\u0027s the one,\" said Mark, smiling. \"She\u0027s stunning pretty,\" added Texas, as the trio drew near. \"Gee-whiz! I don\u0027t blame you.\" \"I liked her right well myself,\" admitted the other. \"That is after I saw her with that brother of hers. She certainly is a good sister to him. But the cadets say she\u0027s[Pg 89] something of a flirt, and Wicks Merritt advised me to leave her alone, so I guess I shall.\" \"Sunday school teacher!\" said Texas, laughing. \"We\u0027ll have to call you Parson, instead of Stanard. But I guess you\u0027re right. That\u0027s not a very beautiful looking cadet she\u0027s with.\" The three were passing then, and Mark arose. \"I guess I\u0027ll have to go speak to her,\" said he. \"She\u0027s beckoning to me. Wait a moment.\" Texas watched his friend approach the group; he could not hear what was said, however, and so he turned away to watch the parade. By doing it he missed an interesting scene. Mary Adams welcomed Mark with a look of gratitude and admiration that Mark could not fail to notice. She had not forgotten the magnitude of the service he had done for her. And then she turned to her two companions. \"Miss Webb,\" she said, \"let me present Mr. Mallory.\" The other girl bowed, and Mary Adams turned to the cadet. \"Mr. Murray, Mr. Mallory,\" said she. [Pg 90]And then came the thunderclap. Mark put out his hand; the cadet quietly put his behind his back. \"The cadets of this academy, Miss Adams,\" said he, \"do not speak to Mr. Mallory. Mr. Mallory is a coward!\" It was a trying moment; Mark felt the blood surge to his head, his fingers twitched and his lip quivered. He longed to spring at the fellow\u0027s throat and fling him to the ground. It was a natural impulse. Texas would have done it. But Mark controlled himself by the effort of his life. He clinched his hands behind him and bit his tongue, and when he spoke he was calm and emotionless. \"Miss Adams,\" he said, \"Mr. Murray and I will settle that later.\" The two girls stared in amazement, \"Mr. Murray\" gazed into space, and Mark turned without another word and strode over to where his friend was sitting. \"Texas!\" he muttered, gripping him by the shoulder. \"Texas, there\u0027s going to be a fight.\" \"Hey!\" cried Texas, springing to his feet. \"What\u0027s that? Whoop!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88084.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
