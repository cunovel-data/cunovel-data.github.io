{"id":15812,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. THE AFFAIR AT THE FORT.","content":"The two began cautiously, like a pair of skillful generals sending out a skirmish line to test the enemy\u0027s strength and resource. This was no such battle as Texas\u0027, a wild rush, a few mighty blows, and then victory. Williams was wary as a cat, sparring lightly, and taking no risks, and the other saw the plan and its wisdom. \"Playing easy,\" muttered the referee, noting the half minute on his watch. \"Know their business, it seems.\" \"Wow!\" growled Texas. \"What\u0027s the good o\u0027 this yere baby business? Say, Parson, ain\u0027t they never goin\u0027 to hit? Whoop!\" This last exclamation was caused by the real beginning of the battle. Williams saw an unguarded face, and quick as thought his heavy arm shot out; the crowd gasped, and Mark saw it. A sudden motion of his head to one side was enough to send the blow past him harmlessly, and a moment later the yearling\u0027s forward plunge was checked by an echoing crack upon his ribs. Then[Pg 110] for the rest of the round the excited cadets were treated to an exhibition of sparring such as they had never seen in their lives. Feinting, dodging and parrying, the springing pair seemed everywhere at once, and their fists in a thousand places. The crowd was thrilled; even the imperturbable Fischer was moved to exclamation, and Texas in half a minute had seen more skill than his whole experience had shown him in his life. \"Look a thar! Look a thar! He\u0027s got him—no—gad! Whoop!\" Texas did as much dancing as the fighters themselves, and more talking than the whole crowd. Captain Fischer had to stop watching him long enough to tell him that the camp, with its sleeping \"tacs,\" was only a few yards away. And then, as Powers subsided, the cadet glanced at his watch, called \"Time!\" and the two fighters went to their corners, panting. \"What did ye stop for?\" inquired Texas, while the Parson set diligently to work at bathing several red spots on his friend\u0027s body. \"What kind o\u0027 fightin\u0027 is this yere? Ain\u0027t give up, have you? Say, Mark, now go in nex\u0027 time an\u0027 do him. What\u0027s the use o\u0027 layin\u0027 off?\" \"A very superior exhibition of—lend me that court-[Pg 111]plaster, please—pugilistic ability,\" commented the Parson, bustling about like an old hen. And then a moment later the referee gave the word and they were at it again. This round there was no delay; both went at it savagely, though warily and skillfully as ever. Blow after blow was planted that seemed fairly to shake the air, driven by all the power that human muscle could give. \"Won\u0027t last long at this rate,\" said the referee, sagely shaking his head. \"Give \u0027em another round—gee!\" Fischer\u0027s \"gee\" was echoed by the yearlings with what would have, but for the nearness of the camp, been a yell of triumph and joy. Williams had seen a chance, and had been a second too quick for Mark; he had landed a crushing blow upon the latter\u0027s head, one which made him stagger. Quick to see his chance, the yearling had sprung in, driving his half-dazed opponent backward, landing blow after blow. Texas gasped in horror. The yearlings danced—and then—— \"Time!\" said the imperturbable Fischer. Texas sprang forward and led his bewildered friend to a seat; Texas was about ready to cry. [Pg 112]\"Old man!\" he muttered, \"don\u0027t let him beat you. Oh! It\u0027ll be the death of me. I\u0027ll go jump into the river!\" \"Steady! Steady!\" said the Parson; \"we\u0027ll be all right in a moment.\" Mark said nothing, but as his reeling brain cleared he gritted his teeth. \"Time,\" said the referee. And Williams sprang forward to finish the work, encouraged by the enthusiastic approval of his half-wild classmates. He aimed another blow with all his might; Mark dodged; the other tried again, and again the plebe leaped to one side; this repeated again and again was the story of the next minute, and the yearlings clinched their hands in disappointment and rage. \"He\u0027s flunking!\" cried one of them—Bull Harris—\"He\u0027s afraid!\" \"He\u0027s fighting just as he ought,\" retorted Captain Fischer, \"and doing it prettily, too. Good!\" And then once more the crowd settled into an anxious silence to watch. The story of that minute was the story of ten. Mark had seen that in brute force his adversary was his equal, and that skill, coolness and endurance were to win. He[Pg 113] made up his mind on his course, and pursued it, regardless of the jeers of the yearlings and their advice to Billy to \"go in and finish him off.\" Billy went, but he could not reach Mark, and occasionally his ardor would be checked by an unexpected blow which made his classmates groan. \"It\u0027s a test of endurance now,\" observed Fischer, \"and Billy ought to win. But the plebe holds well—bully shot, by Jove! Mallory\u0027s evidently kept in training. Time!\" That was for the seventh round. \"He\u0027s getting madder now,\" whispered Mark to Stanard, as he sat down to rest. \"He wants to finish. If those fellows keep at him much more he\u0027ll sail in for a finish—and then, well, I\u0027m pretty fresh yet.\" Goaded on by his impatient classmates, Williams did \"sail in,\" the very next round. Mark led him a dance, from corner to corner, dodging, ducking and twisting, the yearling, thinking the victory his, pressing closer and closer and aiming blow after blow. \"Watch out, Billy, watch out,\" muttered the vigilant Fischer to himself, as he caught the gleam in Mark\u0027s eye. [Pg 114]Just then Williams paused, actually exhausted; Mark saw his chest heaving, and, a still surer sign, his lip trembling. \"Now, then!\" whispered the Parson at his back, and Mark sprang forward. The yearling dodged, Mark followed rapidly. There was a moment of vicious striking, and then the cadets gasped to see Williams give way. It was only an inch, but it told the story—Williams was tired. Fischer gazed at his watch and saw that there was yet half a minute, and at the same moment he heard a resounding thump. Mark had planted a heavy blow upon his opponent\u0027s chest, he followed almost instantly with another, and the yearlings groaned. Williams rallied, and made a desperate fight for his life, but at the close of that round he was what a professional reporter would have termed \"groggy.\" He came up weakly at the call. \"Don\u0027t be afraid of hitting him,\" the Parson had said, afraid that Mark\u0027s kind-heartedness would incline him to mercy. \"There\u0027s too much at stake. Win, and win in a[Pg 115] hurry\"—the Parson forgot to be classical when he was excited. Obedient to command, Mark set out, though it was evident to him that he had the fight. While Texas muttered and pranced about for joy, Mark dealt his opponent another blow which made him stagger; he caught himself upon one knee, and Mark stepped back and waited for him to rise. And then suddenly a pair of strong arms were flung about the plebe\u0027s waist and he felt himself shoved hurriedly along; at the same moment a voice shouted in his ear: \"Run, plebe, run for your life!\" Mark glanced about him in dimly-conscious amazement. He saw that the ring had melted into a number of cadets, skurrying away in every direction at the top of their speed. He heard the words, \"a tac! a tac!\" and knew the fight had been discovered by an army officer. A figure dashed up behind Mark and caught him by the arm. It was Fischer. \"Run for your life! Get in barracks!\" he cried. And with that he vanished, and Mark, obeying, rushed across the cavalry plain and was soon lying breathless and[Pg 116] exhausted in his room, where the wildly-jubilant Texas joined him a moment later, just as reveille was sounded. \"Victory! Victory!\" he shouted. \"Wow!\" And by breakfast time that morning every cadet in the corps was discussing the fight. And Mark was the hero of the whole plebe class. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88087.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
