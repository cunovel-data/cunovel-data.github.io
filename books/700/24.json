{"id":15822,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. A LETTER.","content":"\"My Dear Fischer: I promised to drop you a line just to let you know how I\u0027m getting along, though it does take a tremendous pile of energy to write a letter on a hot afternoon like this. I\u0027m sure I shall go to sleep in the middle of it, and naturally, too, for even writing to you is enough to bore anybody. I can almost imagine you leaning over to whack at me in return for that compliment. \"Well, I am home on furlough; and I don\u0027t know whether I wish I were back or not, for I fear that you will have cut me out on all the girls, especially since you are a high and mighty first captain this year. Speaking of girls, you just ought to be here. The girls at West Point are blasé on cadets, for they see so many; but here a West Point officer is cock of the walk, and I have to fight a jealous rival once a week.\" Cadet Captain Fischer dropped the letter at this stage of it and lay back and laughed. \"Wicks Merritt\u0027s evidently forgotten I was on furlough once myself,\" he said. \"He\u0027s telling me all about how it goes.\" \"What\u0027s he got to say?\" inquired Williams, the[Pg 194] speaker\u0027s tentmate, looking up from the gun he was cleaning. \"Oh, nothing much; only a lot of nonsense—jollying as usual. Wicks always is.\" And then Fischer picked up the letter again, and went on. The two were seated near the door of a tent in \"Company A Street,\" at Camp McPherson. Fischer was lying in front of the tent \"door,\" which was open to admit the morning breeze that swept across the parade ground. His friend sat over in an opposite corner and rubbed away. There was silence of some minutes, broken only by the sound of the polishing and the rustling of Fischer\u0027s paper. And then the latter spoke again. \"Oh, say!\" said he. \"Here\u0027s something that\u0027ll interest you, Billy. Something about your friend Mallory.\" \"Fire away,\" said Williams. \"\u0027By the way, when you answer this let me know something about my pet and protégé, future football captain of the West Point eleven. The last time I heard from where you are, Mark Mallory was raising Cain. I heard that he was a B. J. plebe for fair; that he\u0027d set to work to make war on the yearlings, and had put them[Pg 195] to rout in style; also, incidentally, that he was scheduled to fight Billy Williams, the yearling\u0027s pet athlete. Tell Billy I hope the plebe does him; tell him I say that if Mallory once whacks him on the head with that right arm of his he\u0027ll see more stars from the lick than the Lick telescope can show——\u0027\" \"Billy\" broke in just then with a dismal groan. \"I don\u0027t know whether that\u0027s because of the pun,\" laughed Fischer, \"or because of your recollection of the blow. However, I\u0027ll proceed. \"\u0027Now, I don\u0027t care how much you fellows haze my Mallory; he\u0027s tough and he can stand it. He\u0027ll probably give you tit for tat every time, anyhow. But I do want to say this—watch out that nobody tries any foul play on him, skins him on demerits or reports him unfairly. Do me a favor and keep your eye out for that. Watch particularly Bull Harris, who is, I think, the meanest sneak in the yearling class, and also his chum, Gus Murray. \"\u0027I know it for a fact that Mallory caught Bull in a very dirty act about a month ago and knocked spots out of him for it. I can\u0027t tell you what the act was; but Bull has sworn vengeance and he\u0027ll probably try to get it, so watch for me. If you let Mallory get into trouble, mind what I say, I\u0027ll never forgive you as long as you live. I\u0027ll cut you out with Bessie Smith, who, they say, is your fair one at present. Mallory is a treasure, and when you know him as well as I you\u0027ll think so, too.\u0027\" Cadet Captain Fischer dropped the letter, sat up, and[Pg 196] stared at Williams; and Williams stared back. There was disgust on the faces of both. \"By George!\" cried the latter at last, striking his gunstock in the ground. \"By George! we\u0027ve let \u0027em do it already!\" And after that there was a silence of several unpleasant minutes, during which each was diligently thinking over the situation. \"He\u0027s a fine fellow, anyway,\" continued Williams. \"And we were a pack of fools to let that Bull Harris gang soak him as we did. They\u0027ve gone to work and given him ninety-five demerits in a week on trumped-up charges. And it\u0027s perfectly outrageous, that\u0027s what it is! The plebe\u0027s confoundedly fresh, of course, but he\u0027s a gentleman for all that, and he don\u0027t deserve one-quarter of the demerits he\u0027s gotten. The decent fellows in the class ought to be ashamed of themselves.\" \"That\u0027s what I say! He only has to get five demerits more and then he\u0027s fired for good.\" \"Which means,\" put in the officer, \"that\u0027s he\u0027s sure to be fired by next week.\" \"Exactly! And then what will Wicks say? I went over to barracks to see Mallory about it yesterday;[Pg 197] he\u0027s nearly heart-broken, for he\u0027s worked like a horse to get here, and now he\u0027s ruined—practically expelled. Yet, what can we do?\" \"Can\u0027t he hand in explanations and get the demerits excused?\" suggested Fischer. \"No, because most of the charges had just enough basis of truth in them to make them justifiable. I tell you I was mad when he told me about it; I vowed I\u0027d do something to stop it. Yet what on earth can I do? I can\u0027t think of a thing except to lick that fellow Bull Harris and his crowd. But what possible good will that do Mallory?\" \"Mallory will probably do that himself,\" remarked Fischer, smiling for a moment; his face became serious again as he continued. \"I begin to agree with you, Billy, about that thing. I\u0027ve heard several tales about how Mallory outwitted Bull in his hazing adventures, and the plebe\u0027s probably made him mad. It\u0027s a dirty revenge Bull has taken, and I think if it\u0027s only for Wicks\u0027 sake I\u0027ll put a stop to it.\" \"You!\" echoed Williams. \"Pray, how?\" \"What am I a first captain for?\" laughed Fischer. \"Just you watch me and see what I do! I can\u0027t take[Pg 198] off the ninety-five, but I can see that he don\u0027t get the other five, by Jingo! And I will do it for you, too!\" And with that, the cadet arose and strode out of the tent, leaving his friend to labor at the gun in glum and disconsolate silence. At the same time that Williams and Fischer were discussing the case of this particularly refractory plebe, there were other cadets doing likewise, but with far different sentiments and views. The cadets were Bull Harris and his cronies. They were sitting—half a dozen of them—beneath the shade trees of Trophy Point at the northern end of the parade ground; they were waiting for dinner, and the afternoon, which, being Saturday, was a holiday and for which they had planned some particular delicious hazing adventure. Foremost among them was Bull Harris himself, seated upon one of the cannon. Beside him was Baby Edwards. Gus Murray sat on Bull\u0027s other side and made up a precious trio. Murray was laughing heartily at something just then, and the rest of the crowd seemed to appreciate the joke immensely. [Pg 199]\"Ho! ho!\" said he. \"Just think of it! After I had soaked the confounded plebe for fifty and more, ho! ho! they got suspicious up at headquarters and transferred me, and ho! ho! put M-m-merry Vance on instead, and he, ho! ho! soaked him all the harder!\" And Gus Murray slapped his knee and roared at this truly humorous state of affairs. \"Yes,\" chimed in Merry Vance. \"Yes, I thought when Gus told me he\u0027d been transferred again that we\u0027d lost our chance to skin Mallory for fair. And the very next night up gets the adjutant and reads off the orders putting me on duty over the plebes. Oh, gee! Did you ever hear the like?\" \"Never,\" commented Bull, grinning appreciatively. \"Never,\" chimed in Baby\u0027s little voice. \"Positively never!\" \"Tell us about it,\" suggested another. \"What did you do?\" \"Oh, nothing much,\" replied Vance. \"I went up there at the A. M. inspection, and I just made up my mind to give him twenty demerits, and I did it, that\u0027s all. They had spruced up out of sight; but it didn\u0027t take me very long to find something wrong, I tell you.\" [Pg 200]\"I guess not!\" agreed Baby. \"I gave him the twenty, as you saw; and say, you ought to have seen how sick he looked! Ho! ho!\" And then the crowd indulged in another fit of violent hilarity. \"I guess,\" said Bull, when this had finally passed, \"that we can about count Mallory as out for good. He\u0027s only got five more demerits to run before dismissal, and he\u0027ll be sure to get those in time, even if we don\u0027t give \u0027em to him—which, by the way, I mean to do anyhow. But we\u0027ll just parcel \u0027em one at a time just enough to keep him worried, hey?\" \"That\u0027s it exactly!\" commented the Baby. \"He deserves it every bit!\" growled Bull. \"He\u0027s the B. J.est \u0027beast\u0027 that ever struck West Point. Why, we could never have a moment\u0027s peace with that fellow around. We couldn\u0027t haze anybody. He stopped us half a dozen times.\" The sentiment was the sentiment of the whole gang; and they felt that they had cause to be happy indeed. Their worst enemy had been disposed of and a man might breathe freely once more. The crowd could think[Pg 201] of nothing to talk about that whole morning but that B. J. \"beast\" and his ruin. They found something, however, before many more minutes passed. Bull chanced to glance over his shoulder in the direction of the camp. \"Hello!\" he said. \"Here comes Fischer.\" \"Good-afternoon, Mr. Fischer,\" said Bull. \"Good-afternoon,\" responded the officer, with obvious stiffness; and then there was an awkward silence, during which he surveyed them in silence. \"Mr. Harris,\" he said, at last, \"I\u0027d like to speak to you for a moment; and Mr. Murray, and you, too, Mr. Vance.\" The three stepped out of the group with alacrity, and followed Fischer over to a seat nearby, while the rest of the gang stood and stared in surprise, speculating as to what this could possibly mean. The three with the officer were finding out in a hurry. \"I am told,\" began the latter, gazing at them, with majestic sternness, \"that you three are engaged in skinning a certain plebe——\" \"Why, Mr. Fischer!\" cried the three, in obvious surprise. [Pg 202]\"Don\u0027t interrupt me!\" thundered the captain in a voice that made them quake, and that reached the others and made them quake, too. \"Don\u0027t interrupt me! I know what I am talking about. I was a yearling once myself, and I\u0027m a cadet still, and there\u0027s not the least use trying to pull the wool over my eyes. I know there never yet was a plebe who got fifty demerits in one day and deserved them.\" The captain did not fail to notice here that the trio flushed and looked uncomfortable. \"You all know, I believe,\" he continued, \"just exactly what I think of you. I\u0027ve never hesitated to say it. Now, I want you to understand in the first place that I know of this contemptible trick, and that also I know the plebe, who\u0027s worth more than a dozen of you; and that if he gets a demerit from any one of you again I\u0027ll make you pay for it as sure as I\u0027m alive. Just remember it, that\u0027s all!\" And with this, the indignant captain turned upon his heel, and strode off, leaving the yearlings as if a bombshell had landed in their midst. \"Fischer\u0027s a confounded fool!\" Bull Harris broke out at last. [Pg 203]\"Just what he is!\" cried the Baby. \"I\u0027d like to knock him over.\" And after that there was silence again, broken only by the roll of a drum that meant dinner. \"Well,\" was Bull\u0027s final word, as the crowd set out for camp, \"it\u0027s unfortunate, I must say. But it won\u0027t make the least bit of difference. Mallory\u0027ll get his demerits sure as he\u0027s alive, and Fischer\u0027s interference won\u0027t matter in the least.\" \"That\u0027s what!\" cried the rest of them. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88097.html","bookId":700,"book":{"id":700,"title":"A Cadet\u0027s Honor","description":"简介： The whole class came to the meeting.
