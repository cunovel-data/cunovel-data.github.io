He pulled ahead rapidly, though the few running lights hardly let him see the centerline.\\n\\n The fore gangway was even worse - completely empty and its lights dim and flickering. Seeing by blurs bothered him now that he knew what seeing sharp was like. He was beginning to sweat and shake and cramp from his withdrawal from alcohol and his thoughts were a tumult. He wondered if any of the weird things that had happened since meeting Kim were real or dream. Kim\u0027s refusal - or inability? - to talk any more was disquieting. He began seeing the misty rims of blurs that vanished when he looked straight toward them. He remembered Keeper and the brewos talking about vamps and witches.\\n\\n Then instead of waiting for the Bat Rack\u0027s green hatch, he dove off into the passageway leading to the aft one. This passageway had no lights at all. Out of it he thought he could hear Hellhound growling, but couldn\u0027t be sure because the big chewer was grinding. He was scrabbling with panic when he entered the Bat Rack through the dark red hatch, remembering barely in time to avoid the new glue.\\n\\n The place was jumping with light and excitement and dancing figures, and Keeper at once began to shout abuse at him. He dove into the torus and began taking orders and serving automatically, working entirely by touch and voice, because withdrawal now had his vision swimming - a spinning blur of blurs.\\n\\n After a while that got better, but his nerves got worse. Only the unceasing work kept him going - and shut out Keeper\u0027s abuse - but he was getting too tired to work at all. As Playday dawned, with the crowd around the torus getting thicker all the while, he snatched a pouch of moonmist and set it to his lips.\\n\\n Claws dug his chest. \"Isssiot! Sssot! Ssslave of fffear!\"\\n\\n Spar almost went into convulsions, but put back the moonmist. Kim came out of the slopsuit and pushed off contemptuously, circled the bar and talked to various of the drinkers, soon became a conversation piece. Keeper started to boast about him and quit serving. Spar worked on and on and on through sobriety more nightmarish than any drunk he could recall. And far, far longer.\\n\\n Suzy came in with a mark and touched Spar\u0027s hand when he served her dark to her. It helped.\\n\\n He thought he recognized a voice from below. It came from a kinky-haired, slopsuited brewo he didn\u0027t know. But then he heard the man again and thought he was Ensign Drake. There were several brewos he didn\u0027t recognize.\\n\\n The place started really jumping. Keeper upped the music. Singly or in pairs, somersaulting dancers bounded back and forth between shrouds. Others toed a shroud and shimmied. A girl in black did splits on one. A girl in white dove through the torus. Keeper put it on her boyfriend\u0027s check. Brewos tried to sing.\\n\\n Spar heard Kim recite:\\n\\n \"Izz a cat.\\n\\n Killzz a rat.\\n\\n Greetss each guy.\\n\\n Thin or ffat.\\n\\n Saay dolls, hi!\"\\n\\n Playday night fell. The place got hotter. Doc didn\u0027t come. But Crown did. Dancers parted and a whole section of drinkers made way aloft for him and his girls and Hellhound, so that they had a third of the torus to themselves, with no one below in that third either. To Spar\u0027s surprise they all took coffee except the dog, who when asked by Crown, responded, \"Bloody Mary,\" drawing out the words in such deep tones that they were little more than a low \"Bluh-Muh\" growl.\\n\\n \"Iss that sspeech, I assk you?\" Kim commented from the other side of the torus. Drunks around him choked down chuckles.\\n\\n Spar served the pouched coffee piping hot with felt holders and mixed Hellhound\u0027s drink in a self-squeezing syringe with sipping tube. He was very groggy and for the moment more afraid for Kim than himself. The face blurs tended to swim, but he could distinguish Rixende by her black hair, Phanette and Doucette by their matching red-blonde hair and oddly red-mottled fair skins, while Almodie was the platinum-haired pale one, yet she looked horribly right between the dark brown, purple-vested blur to one side of her and the blacked, narrower, prick-eared silhouette to the other.\\n\\n Spar heard Crown whisper to her, \"Ask Keeper to show you the talking cat.\" The whisper was very low and Spar wouldn\u0027t have heard it except that Crown\u0027s voice had a strange excited vibrancy Spar had never known in it before.\\n\\n \"But won\u0027t they fight then? - I mean Hellhound,\" she answered in a voice that sent silvery tendrils around Spar\u0027s heart. He yearned to see her face through Doc\u0027s tube. She would look like Virgo, only more beautiful. Yet, Crown\u0027s girl, she could be no virgin. It was a strange and horrible world. Her eyes were violet. But he was sick of blurs. Almodie sounded very frightened, yet she continued, \"Please don\u0027t, Crown.\" Spar\u0027s heart was captured.\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s the whole idea, baby. And nobody dont\u0027s us. We thought we\u0027d schooled you to that. We\u0027d teach you another lesson here, except tonight we smell high fuzz - lots of it, Keeper! - our new lady wishes to hear your cat talk. Bring it over.\"\\n\\n \"I really don\u0027t...\" Almodie began and went no further.\\n\\n Kim came floating across the torus while Keeper was shouting in the opposite direction. The cat checked himself against a slender shroud and looked straight at Crown. \"Yesss?\"\\n\\n \"Keeper, shut that junk off.\" The music died abruptly. Voices rose, then died abruptly too. \"Well, cat, talk.\"\\n\\n \"Shshall ssing insstead,\" Kim announced and began an eerie caterwauling that had a pattern but was not Spar\u0027s idea of music.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an abstraction,\" Almodie breathed delightedly. \"Listen, Crown, that was a diminished seventh.\"\\n\\n \"A demented third, I\u0027d say,\" Phanette commented from the other side.\\n\\n Crown signed them to be quiet.\\n\\n Kim finished with a high trill. He slowly looked around at his baffled audience and then began to groom his shoulder.\\n\\n Crown gripped a ridge of the torus with his left hand and said evenly, \"Since you will not talk to us, will you talk to our dog?\"\\n\\n Kim stared at Hellhound sucking his Bloody Mary. His eyes widened, their pupils slitted, his lips writhed back from needle-like fangs.\\n\\n He hissed, \"Schschweinhund!\"\\n\\n Hellhound launched himself, hind paws against the palm of Crown\u0027s left hand, which threw him forward toward the left, where Kim was dodging. But the cat switched directions, rebounding hindwards from the next shroud. The dog\u0027s white-jagged jaws snapped sideways a foot from their mark as his great-chested black body hurtled past.\\n\\n Hellhound landed with four paws in the middle of a fat drunk, who puffed out his wind barely before his swallow, but the dog took off instantly on reverse course. Kim bounced back and forth between shrouds. This time hair flew when jaws snapped, but also a rigidly spread paw slashed.\\n\\n Crown grabbed Hellhound by his studded collar, restraining him from another dive. He touched the dog below the eye and smelled his fingers. \"That\u0027ll be enough, boy,\" he said. \"Can\u0027t go around killing musical geniuses.\" His hand dropped from his nose to below the torus and came up loosely fisted. \"Well, cat, you\u0027ve talked with our dog. Have you a word for us?\"\\n\\n \"Yesss!\" Kim drifted to the shroud nearest Crown\u0027s face. Spar pushed off to grab him back, while Almodie gazed at Crown\u0027s fist and edged a hand toward it.\\n\\n Kim loudly hissed, \"Hellzzz ssspawn! Fffiend!\"\\n\\n Both Spar and Almodie were too late. From between two of Crown\u0027s fisted fingers a needle-stream jetted and struck Kim in the open mouth.\\n\\n After what seemed to Spar a long time, his hand interrupted the stream. Its back burned acutely.\\n\\n Kim seemed to collapse into himself, then launched himself away from Crown, toward the dark, open-jawed.\\n\\n Crown said, \"That\u0027s mace, an antique weapon like Greek fire, but well-known to our folk. The perfect answer to a witch cat.\"\\n\\n Spar sprang at Crown, grappled his chest, tried to butt his jaw. They moved away from the torus at half the speed with which Spar had sprung.\\n\\n Crown got his head aside. Spar closed his gums on Crown\u0027s throat. There was a snick. Spar felt wind on his bare back. Then a cold triangle pressed his flesh over his kidneys. Spar opened his jaws and floated limp. Crown chuckled.\\n\\n A blue fuzz-glare, held by a brewo, made everyone in the Bat Rack look more corpse-like than larboard light. A voice commanded, \"Okay, folks, break it up. Go home. We\u0027re closing the place.\"\\n\\n Sleepday dawned, drowning the fuzz-glare. The cold triangle left Spar\u0027s back. There was another snick. Saying, \"Bye-bye, baby,\" Crown pushed off through the white glare toward four women\u0027s faces and one dog\u0027s. Phanette\u0027s and Doucette\u0027s faintly red-mottled ones were close beside Hellhound\u0027s, as if they might be holding his collar.\\n\\n Spar sobbed and began to hunt for Kim. After a while Suzy came to help him. The Bat Rack emptied. Spar and Suzy cornered Kim. Spar grasped the cat around the chest. Kim\u0027s forelegs embraced his wrist, claws pricking. Spar got out the pouch Doc had given him and shoved its mouth between Kim\u0027s jaws. The claws dug deep. Taking no note of that, Spar gently sprayed. Gradually the claws came out and Kim relaxed. Spar hugged him gently. Suzy bound up Spar\u0027s wounded wrist.\\n\\n Keeper came up followed by two brewos, one of them Ensign Drake, who said, \"My partner and I will watch today by the aft and starboard hatches.\" Beyond them the Bat Rack was empty.\\n\\n Spar said, \"Crown has a knife.\" Drake nodded.\\n\\n Suzy touched Spar\u0027s hand and said, \"Keeper, I want to stay here tonight. I\u0027m scared.\"\\n\\n Keeper said, \"I can offer you a shroud.\"\\n\\n Drake and his mate dove slowly toward their posts.\\n\\n Suzy squeezed Spar\u0027s hand. He said, rather heavily, \"I can offer you my shroud, Suzy.\"\\n\\n Keeper laughed and after looking toward the Bridge men, whispered, \"I can offer you mine, which, unlike Spar, I own. And moonmist. Otherwise, the passageways.\"\\n\\n Suzy sighed, paused, then went off with him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows/page-7.html","bookId":1609,"book":{"id":1609,"title":"Ship of Shadows","description":"Storyline: The fourfold sting of the eye teeth balanced the gut-wretchedness of his looming hangover, so that Spar\u0027s mind floated as free as his body in the blackness of Windrush, in which shone only a couple of running lights dim as churning dream-glow and infinitely distant as the Bridge or the Stern.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ship-of-shadows.jpg","author":"Fritz Leiber","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:44 PM"}}
