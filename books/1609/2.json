Outside the hatch he heard some drunks calling with weary and mournful anger, \"Unzip!\"\\n\\n Grasping the heads of two long waste tubes, Spar began to sweep the air, working out from the green corner in a spiral, quite like an orb spider building her web.\\n\\n From the torus, where he was idly polishing its thin titanium, Keeper upped the suction on the two tubes, so that reaction sped Spar in his spiral. He need use his body only to steer course and to avoid shrouds in such a way that his tubes didn\u0027t tangle.\\n\\n Soon Keeper glanced at his wrist and called, \"Spar, can\u0027t you keep track of the time? Open up!\" He threw a ring of keys which Spar caught, though he could see only the last half of their flight. As soon as he was well headed toward the green door, Keeper called again and pointed aft and aloft. Spar obediently unlocked and unzipped the dark and also the blue hatch, though there was no one at either, before opening the green. In each case he avoided the hatch\u0027s gummy margin and the sticky emergency hatch hinged close beside.\\n\\n In tumbled three brewos, old customers, snatching at shrouds and pushing off from each other\u0027s bodies in their haste to reach the torus, and meanwhile cursing Spar.\\n\\n \"Sky strangle you!\"\\n\\n \"Earth bury you!\"\\n\\n \"Seas sear you!\"\\n\\n \"Language, boys!\" Keeper reproved. \"Though I\u0027ll agree my helper\u0027s stupidity and sloth tempt a man to talk foul.\"\\n\\n Spar threw the keys back. The brewos lined up elbow to elbow around the torus, three grayish blobs with heads pointing toward the blue corner.\\n\\n Keeper faced them. \"Below, below!\" he ordered indignantly. \"You think you\u0027re gents?\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re serving no one aloft yet.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s only us three.\"\\n\\n \"No matter,\" Keeper replied. \"Propriety, suckers! Unless you mean to buy by the pouch, invert.\"\\n\\n With low grumbles the brewos reversed their bodies so that their heads pointed toward the black corner.\\n\\n Himself not bothering to invert, Keeper tossed them a slim and twisty faint red blur with three branches. Each grabbed a branch and stuck it in his face.\\n\\n The pudge of his fat hand on glint of valve, Keeper said, \"Let\u0027s see your scrip first.\"\\n\\n With angry mumbles each unwadded something too small for Spar to see clearly, and handed it over. Keeper studied each item before feeding it to the cashbox. Then he decreed, \"Six seconds of moonbrew. Suck fast,\" and looked at his wrist and moved the other hand.\\n\\n One of the brewos seemed to be strangling, but he blew out through his nose and kept sucking bravely.\\n\\n Keeper closed the valve.\\n\\n Instantly one brewo splutteringly accused, \"You cut us off too soon. That wasn\u0027t six.\"\\n\\n The treacle back in his voice, Keeper explained, \"I\u0027m squirting it to you four and two. Don\u0027t want you to drown. Ready again?\"\\n\\n The brewos greedily took their second squirt and then, at times wistfully sucking their tubes for remnant drops, began to shoot the breeze. In his distant circling, Spar\u0027s keen ears heard most of it.\\n\\n \"A dirty Sleepday, Keeper.\"\\n\\n \"No, a good one, brewo - for a drunken sucker to get his blood sucked by a lust-tickling vamp.\"\\n\\n \"I was dossed safe at Pete\u0027s, you fat ghoul.\"\\n\\n \"Pete\u0027s safe? That\u0027s news!\"\\n\\n \"Dirty Atoms to you! But vamps did get Girlie and Sweetheart. Right in the starboard main drag, if you can believe it. By Cobalt Ninety, Windrush is getting lonely! Third Hold, anyhow. You can swim a whole passageway by day without meeting a soul.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know that about the girls?\" the second brewo demanded. \"Maybe they\u0027ve gone to another hold to change their luck.\"\\n\\n \"Their luck\u0027s run out. Suzy saw them snatched.\"\\n\\n \"Not Suzy,\" Keeper corrected, now playing umpire. \"But Mabel did. A proper fate for drunken sluts.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got no heart, Keeper.\"\\n\\n \"True enough. That\u0027s why the vamps pass me by. But speaking serious, boys, the werethings and witches are running too free in Three. I was awake all Sleepday guarding. I\u0027m sending a complaint to the Bridge.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re kidding.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Keeper solemnly nodded his head and crossed his left chest. The brewos were impressed.\\n\\n Spar spiraled back toward the green corner, sweeping farther from the wall. On his way he overtook the black blob of Kim, who was circling the periphery himself, industriously leaping from shroud to shroud and occasionally making dashes along them.\\n\\n A fair-skinned, plump shape twice circled by blue - bra and culottes - swam in through the green hatch.\\n\\n \"Morning, Spar,\" a soft voice greeted. \"How\u0027s it going?\"\\n\\n \"Fair and foul,\" Spar replied. The golden cloud of blonde hair floating loose touched his face. \"I\u0027m quitting moonmist, Suzy.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be too hard on yourself, Spar. Work a day, loaf a day, play a day, sleep a day - that way it\u0027s best.\"\\n\\n \"I know. Workday, Loafday, Playday, Sleepday. Ten days make a terranth, twelve terranths make a sunth, twelve sunths make a starth, and so on, to the end of time. With corrections, some tell me. I wish I knew what all those names mean.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re too serious. You should - Oh, a kitten! How darling!\"\\n\\n \"Kitten-shmitten!\" the big-headed black blur hissed as it leapt past them. \"Izzz cat. IZZZ Kim.\"\\n\\n \"Kim\u0027s our new catcher,\" Spar explained. \"He\u0027s serious too.\"\\n\\n \"Quit wasting time on old Toothless Eyeless, Suzy,\" Keeper called, \"and come all the way in.\"\\n\\n As Suzy complied with a sigh, taking the easy route of the ratlines, her soft taper fingers brushed Spar\u0027s crumpled cheek. \"Dear Spar...\" she murmured. As her feet passed his face, there was a jingle of her charm-anklet - all gold-washed hearts, Spar knew.\\n\\n \"Hear about Girlie and Sweetheart?\" a brewo greeted ghoulishly. \"How\u0027d you like your carotid or outside iliac sliced, your - ?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows/page-2.html","bookId":1609,"book":{"id":1609,"title":"Ship of Shadows","description":"Storyline: The fourfold sting of the eye teeth balanced the gut-wretchedness of his looming hangover, so that Spar\u0027s mind floated as free as his body in the blackness of Windrush, in which shone only a couple of running lights dim as churning dream-glow and infinitely distant as the Bridge or the Stern.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ship-of-shadows.jpg","author":"Fritz Leiber","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:44 PM"}}
