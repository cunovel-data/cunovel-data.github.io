It was very strange to see Keeper\u0027s face in detail. It looked old and its pink target center was a big red nose criss-crossed by veins. His brown eyes were not so much curious as avid. He asked about the things around Spar\u0027s eyes. Spar decided it wouldn\u0027t be wise to tell Keeper about seeing sharply.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re a new kind of costume jewelry, Keeper. Blasted Earth, I don\u0027t have any hair on my head, ought to have something.\"\\n\\n \"Language, Spar! It\u0027s like a drunk to spend precious scrip on such a grotesque bauble.\"\\n\\n Spar neither reminded Keeper that all the scrip he\u0027d earned at the Bat Rack amounted to no more than a wad as big as his thumb-joint, nor that he\u0027d quit drinking. Nor did he tell him about his teeth, but kept them hidden behind his lips.\\n\\n Kim was nowhere in sight. Keeper shrugged. \"Gone off somewhere. You know the way of strays, Spar.\"\\n\\n Yes, thought Spar, this one\u0027s stayed put too long.\\n\\n He kept being amazed that he could see all of the Bat Rack sharply. It was an octahedron criss-crossed by shrouds and made up of two pyramids put together square base to square base. The apexes of the pyramids were the violet fore and dark red aft corners. The four other corners were the starboard green, the black below, the larboard scarlet, and the blue aloft, if you named them from aft in the way the hands of a watch move.\\n\\n Suzy drifted in early Playday. Spar was shocked by her blowzy appearance and bloodshot eyes. But he was touched by her signs of affection and he felt the strong friendship between them. Twice when Keeper wasn\u0027t looking he switched her nearly empty pouch of dark for a full one. She told him that, yes, she\u0027d once known Sweetheart and that, yes, she\u0027d heard people say Mabel had seen Sweetheart snatched by vamps.\\n\\n Business was slow for Playday. There were no strange brewos. Hoping against fearful, gut-level certainty, Spar kept waiting for Doc to come in zig-zagging along the ratlines and comment on the new gadgets he\u0027d given Spar and spout about the Old Days and his strange philosophy.\\n\\n Playday night Crown came in with his girls, all except Almodie. Doucette said she\u0027d had a headache and stayed at the Hole. Once again, all of them ordered coffee, though to Spar all of them seemed high.\\n\\n Spar covertly studied their faces. Though nervous and alive, they all had something in their stares akin to those he\u0027d seen in most of the officers on the Bridge. Doc had said they were all zombies. It was interesting to find out that Phanette\u0027s and Doucette\u0027s red-mottled appearance was due to... freckles, tiny reddish star-clusters on their white skins.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s that famous talking cat?\" Crown asked Spar.\\n\\n Spar shrugged. Keeper said, \"Strayed. For which I\u0027m glad. Don\u0027t want a little feline who makes fights like last night.\"\\n\\n Keeping his yellow-brown irised eyes on Spar, Crown said, \"We believe it was that fight last Playday gave Almodie her headache, so she didn\u0027t want to come back tonight. We\u0027ll tell her you got rid of the witch cat.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d have got rid of the beast if Spar hadn\u0027t,\" Keeper put in. \"So you think it was a witch cat, coroner?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re certain. What\u0027s that stuff on Spar\u0027s face?\"\\n\\n \"A new sort of cheap eye-jewelry, coroner, such as attracts drunks.\"\\n\\n Spar got the feeling that this conversation had been prearranged, that there was a new agreement between Crown and Keeper. But he just shrugged again. Suzy was looking angry, but she said nothing.\\n\\n Yet she stayed behind again after the Bat Rack closed. Keeper put no claim on her, though he leered knowingly before disappearing with a yawn and a stretch through the scarlet hatch. Spar checked that all six hatches were locked and shut off the lights, though that made no difference in the morning glare, before returning to Suzy, who had gone to his sleeping shroud.\\n\\n Suzy asked, \"You didn\u0027t get rid of Kim?\"\\n\\n Spar answered, \"No, he just strayed, as Keeper said at first I don\u0027t know where Kim is.\"\\n\\n Suzy smiled and put her arms around him. \"I think your new eye-things are beautiful,\" she said.\\n\\n Spar said, \"Suzy, did you know that Windrush isn\u0027t the Universe? That\u0027s it\u0027s a ship going through space around a white round marked with circles, a round much bigger than all Windrush?\"\\n\\n Suzy replied, \"I know Windrush is sometimes called the Ship. I\u0027ve seen that round - in pictures. Forget all wild thoughts, Spar, and lose yourself in me.\"\\n\\n Spar did so, chiefly from friendship. He forgot to clip his ankle to the shroud. Suzy\u0027s body didn\u0027t attract him. He was thinking of Almodie.\\n\\n When it was over, Suzy slept. Spar put the rag around his eyes and tried to do the same. He was troubled by withdrawal symptoms only a little less bad than last Sleepday\u0027s. Because of that little, he didn\u0027t go to the torus for a pouch of moonmist. But then there was a sharp jab in his back, as if a muscle had spasmed there, and the symptoms got much worse. He convulsed, once, twice, then just as the agony became unbearable, blanked out.\\n\\n Spar woke, his head throbbing, to discover that he was not only clipped, but lashed to his shroud, his wrists stretched in one direction, his ankles in the other, his hands and his feet both numb. His nose rubbed the shroud.\\n\\n Light made his eyelids red. He opened them a little at a time and saw Hellhound poised with bent hind legs against the next shroud. He could see Hellhound\u0027s great stabbing teeth very clearly. If he had opened his eyes a little more swiftly, Hellhound would have dived at his throat.\\n\\n He rubbed his sharp metal teeth together. At least he had more than gums to meet an attack on his face.\\n\\n Beyond Hellhound he saw black and transparent spirals. He realized he was in Crown\u0027s Hole. Evidently the last jab in his back had been the injection of a drug.\\n\\n But Crown had not taken away his eye jewelry, nor noted his teeth. He had thought of Spar as old Eyeless Toothless.\\n\\n Between Hellhound and the spirals, he saw Doc lashed to a shroud and his big black bag clipped next to him. Doc was gagged. Evidently he had tried to cry out. Spar decided not to. Doc\u0027s gray eyes were open and Spar thought Doc was looking at him.\\n\\n Very slowly Spar moved his numb fingers on top of the knot lashing his wrists to the shroud and slowly contracted all his muscles and pulled. The knot slid down the shroud a millimeter. So long as he did something slowly enough, Hellhound could not see it. He repeated this action at intervals.\\n\\n Even more slowly he swung his face to the left. He saw nothing more than that the hatch to the corridor was zipped shut, and that beyond the dog and Doc, between the black spirals, was an empty and unfurnished cabin whose whole starboard side was stars. The hatch to that cabin was open, with its black-striped emergency hatch wavering beside it.\\n\\n With equal slowness he swung his face to the right, past Doc and past Hellhound, who was eagerly watching him for signs of life or waking. He had pulled down the knot on his wrists two centimeters.\\n\\n The first thing he saw was a transparent oblong. In it were more stars and, by its aft edge, the smoky orange round. At last he could see the latter more clearly. The smoke was on top, the orange underneath and irregularly placed. The whole was about as big as Spar\u0027s palm could have covered, if he had been able to stretch out his arm to full length. As he watched, he saw a bright flash in one of the orange areas. The flash was short, then it turned to a tiny black round pushing out through the smoke. More than ever, Spar felt sadness.\\n\\n Below the transparency, Spar saw a horrible tableau. Suzy was strapped to a bright metal rack guyed by shrouds. She was very pale and her eyes were closed. From the side of her neck went a red sipping-tube which forked into five branches. Four of the branches went into the red mouths of Crown, Rixende, Phanette, and Doucette. The fifth was shut by a small metal clip, and beyond it Almodie floated cowering, hands over her eyes.\\n\\n Crown said softly, \"We want it all. Strip her, Rixie.\"\\n\\n Rixende clipped shut the end of her tube and swam to Suzy. Spar expected her to remove the blue culottes and bra, but instead she simply began to massage one of Suzy\u0027s legs, pressing always from ankle toward waist, driving her remaining blood nearer her neck.\\n\\n Crown removed his sipping tube from his lips long enough to say, \"Ahhh, good to the last drop.\" Then he had mouthed the blood that had spurted out in the interval and had the tube in place again.\\n\\n Phanette and Doucette convulsed with soundless giggles.\\n\\n Almodie peered between her parted fingers, out of her mass of platinum hair, then scissored them shut again.\\n\\n After a while Crown said, \"That\u0027s all we\u0027ll get. Phan and Doucie, feed her to the big chewer. If you meet anyone in the passageway, pretend she\u0027s drunk. Afterwards we\u0027ll get Doc to dose us high, and give him a little brew if he behaves, then we\u0027ll drink Spar.\"\\n\\n Spar had his wrist knot more than halfway to his teeth. Hellhound kept watching eagerly for movement, unable to see movement that slow. Slaver made tiny gray globes beside his fangs.\\n\\n Phanette and Doucette opened the hatch and steered Suzy\u0027s dead body through it.\\n\\n Embracing Rixende, Crown said expansively toward Doc, \"Well, isn\u0027t it the right thing, old man? Nature bloody in tooth and claw, a wise one said. They\u0027ve poisoned everything there.\" He pointed toward the smoky orange round sliding out of sight. \"They\u0027re still fighting, but they\u0027ll soon all be dead. So death should be the rule too for this gimcrack, so-called survival ship. Remember they are aboard her. When we\u0027ve drunk the blood of everyone aboard Windrush, including their blood, we\u0027ll drink our own, if our own isn\u0027t theirs.\"\\n\\n Spar thought, Crown thinks too much in they\u0027s. The knot was close to his teeth. He heard the big chewer start to grind.\\n\\n In the empty next cabin, Spar saw Drake and Fenner, clad once more as brewos, swimming toward the open hatch.\\n\\n But Crown saw them too. \"Get \u0027em, Hellhound,\" he directed, pointing. \"It\u0027s our command.\"\\n\\n The big black dog bulleted from his shroud through the open hatch. Drake pointed something at him. The dog went limp.\\n\\n Chuckling softly, Crown took by one tip a swastika with curved, gleaming, razor-sharp blades and sent it off spinning. It curved past Spar and Doc, went through the open hatch, missed Drake and Fenner - and Hellhound - and struck the wall of stars.\\n\\n There was a rush of wind, then the emergency hatch smacked shut. Spar saw Drake, Fenner, and Hellhound, wavery through the transparent pliofilm, spew blood, bloat, burst bloodily open. The empty cabin they had been in disappeared. Windrush had a new wall and Crown\u0027s Hole was distorted.\\n\\n Far beyond, growing ever tinier, the swastika spun toward the stars.\\n\\n Phanette and Doucette came back. \"We buried Suzy. Someone was coming, so we beat it.\" The big chewer stopped grinding.\\n\\n Spar bit cleanly through his wrist lashings and immediately doubled over to bite his ankles loose.\\n\\n Crown dove at him. Pausing to draw knives, the four girls did the same.\\n\\n Phanette, Doucette, and Rixende went limp. Spar had the impression that small black balls had glanced from their skulls.\\n\\n There wasn\u0027t time to bite his feet loose, so he straightened. Crown hit his chest as Almodie hit his feet.\\n\\n Crown and Spar giant-swung around the shroud. Then Almodie had cut Spar\u0027s ankles loose. As they spun off along the tangent, Spar tried to knee Crown in the groin, but Crown twisted and evaded the blow as they moved toward the inboard wall.\\n\\n There was the snick of Crown\u0027s knife unfolding. Spar saw the dark wrist and grabbed it. He butted at Crown\u0027s jaw. Crown evaded. Spar set his teeth in Crown\u0027s neck and bit.\\n\\n Blood covered Spar\u0027s face, spurted over it. He spat out a hunk of flesh. Crown convulsed. Spar fought off the knife. Crown went limp. That the pressure in a man should work against him.\\n\\n Spar shook the blood from his face. Through its beads, he saw Keeper and Kim side by side. Almodie was clutching his ankles. Phanette, Doucette, Rixende floated.\\n\\n Keeper said proudly, \"I shot them with my gun for drunks. I knocked them out. Now I\u0027ll cut their throats, if you wish.\"\\n\\n Spar said, \"No more throat-cutting. No more blood.\" Shaking off Almodie\u0027s hands, he took off for Doc, picking up Doucette\u0027s floating knife by the way.\\n\\n He slashed Doc\u0027s lashings and cut the gag from his face.\\n\\n Meanwhile Kim hissed, \"Sstole and ssecreted Keeper\u0027s sscrip from the boxx. Ashshured him you sstole it, Sspar. You and Ssuzzy. Sso he came. Keeper izz a shshlemiel.\"\\n\\n Keeper said, \"I saw Suzy\u0027s foot going into the big chewer. I knew it by its anklet of hearts. After that I had the courage to kill Crown or anyone. I loved Suzy.\"\\n\\n Doc cleared his throat and croaked, \"Moonmist.\" Spar found a triple pouch and Doc sucked it all. Doc said, \"Crown spoke the truth. Windrush is a plastic survival ship from Earth. Earth - \" He motioned toward the dull orange round disappearing aft in the window \" - poisoned herself with smog pollution and with nuclear war. She spent gold for war, plastic for survival. Best forgotten. Windrush went mad. Understandably. Even without the Lethean rickettsia, or Styx ricks, as you call it. Thought Windrush was the cosmos. Crown kidnapped me to get my drugs, kept me alive to know the doses.\"\\n\\n Spar looked at Keeper. \"Clean up here,\" he ordered. \"Feed Crown to the big chewer.\"\\n\\n Almodie pulled herself from Spar\u0027s ankles to his waist. \"There was a second survival ship. Circumluna. When Windrush went mad, my father and mother - and you - were sent here, to investigate and cure. But my father died and you got Styx ricks. My mother died just before I was given to Crown. She sent you Kim.\"\\n\\n Kim hissed, \"My fforebear came from Circumluna to Windrush, too. Great grandmother. Taught me the ffigures for Windrushsh... Radiuss from moon-ccenter, 2,500 miles. Period, ssixx hours - sso, the sshort dayss. A terranth izz the time it takess Earth to move through a consstellation, and sso on.\"\\n\\n Doc said, \"So, Spar, you\u0027re the only one who remembers without cynicism. You\u0027ll have to take over. It\u0027s all yours, Spar.\"\\n\\n Spar had to agree. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows/page-9.html","bookId":1609,"book":{"id":1609,"title":"Ship of Shadows","description":"Storyline: The fourfold sting of the eye teeth balanced the gut-wretchedness of his looming hangover, so that Spar\u0027s mind floated as free as his body in the blackness of Windrush, in which shone only a couple of running lights dim as churning dream-glow and infinitely distant as the Bridge or the Stern.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ship-of-shadows.jpg","author":"Fritz Leiber","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:44 PM"}}
