{"id":93036,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"Don\u0027t bother. We believe he\u0027s got his own tongue too. That the matter, Blackie?\" He reached out his hand. Kim lashed at it and sprang away. Crown only gave another of his low chuckles.\\n\\n Rixende began to shake uncontrollably. Crown examined her solicitously yet leisurely, using his outstretched hand to turn her head toward him, so that any blood that might have been coming from it from the cat\u0027s slash would have gone into the sponge.\\n\\n \"Spar swore the cat could talk,\" Keeper babbled. \"I\u0027ll - \"\\n\\n \"Quiet,\" Crown said. He put the pouch to Rixende\u0027s lips, squeezed until her shaking subsided and it was empty, then flicked the crumpled pliofilm toward Spar.\\n\\n \"And now about that little black bag, Keeper,\" Crown said flatly.\\n\\n \"Spar!\"\\n\\n The latter dipped into his lost-and-found nook, saying quickly, \"No little black bags, coroner, but we did find this one the lady Rixende forgot last Playday night,\" and he turned back holding out something big, round, gleamingly orange, and closed with draw strings.\\n\\n Crown took and swung it slowly in a circle. For Spar, who couldn\u0027t see the strings, it was like magic. \"Bit too big, and a mite the wrong shade. We\u0027re certain we lost the little black bag here, or had it lifted. You making the Bat Rack a tent for dips, Keeper?\"\\n\\n \"Spar - ?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re asking you, Keeper.\"\\n\\n Shoving Spar aside, Keeper groped frantically in the nook, pulling aside the cages of moonmist and moonbrew pouches. He produced many small objects. Spar could distinguish the largest - an electric hand-fan and a bright red footglove. They hung around Keeper in a jumble.\\n\\n Keeper was panting and had scrabbled his hands for a full minute in the nook without bringing out anything more, when Crown said, his voice lazy again, \"That\u0027s enough. The little black bag was of no importance to us in any case.\"\\n\\n Keeper emerged with a face doubly blurred. It must be surrounded by a haze of sweat. He pointed an arm at the orange bag.\\n\\n \"It might be inside that one!\"\\n\\n Crown opened the bag, began to search through it, changed his mind, and gave the whole bag a flick. Its remarkably numerous contents came out and moved slowly aloft at equal speeds, like an army on the march in irregular order. Crown scanned them as they went past.\\n\\n \"No, not there.\" He pushed the bag toward Keeper. \"Return Rix\u0027s stuff to it and have it ready for us the next time we dive in - \"\\n\\n Putting his arm around Rixende, so that it was his hand that held the sponge to her ear, he turned and kicked off powerfully for the aft hatch. After he had been out of sight for several seconds, there was a general sigh, the three brewos put out new scrip-wads to pay for another squirt. Suzy asked for a second double dark, which Spar handed her quickly, while Keeper shook off his daze and ordered Spar, \"Gather up all the floating trash, especially Rixie\u0027s, and get that back in her purse. On the jump, lubber!\" Then he used the electric hand-fan to cool and dry himself.\\n\\n It was a mean task Keeper had set Spar, but Kim came to help, darting after objects too small for Spar to see. Once he had them in his hands, Spar could readily finger or sniff which was which.\\n\\n When his impotent rage at Crown had faded, Spar\u0027s thoughts went back to Sleepday night. Had his vision of vamps and werewolves been dream only? - now that he knew the werethings had been abroad in force. If only he had better eyes to distinguish illusion from reality! Kim\u0027s \"Sssee! Sssee shshsharply!\" hissed in his memory. What would it be like to see sharply? Everything brighter? Or closer?\\n\\n After a weary time the scattered objects were gathered and he went back to sweeping and Kim to his mouse hunt. As Workday morning progressed, the Bat Rack gradually grew less bright, though so gradually it was hard to tell.\\n\\n A few more customers came in, but all for quick drinks, which Keeper served them glumly; Suzy judged none of them worth cottoning up to.\\n\\n As time slowly passed, Keeper grew steadily more fretfully angry, as Spar had known he would after groveling before Crown. He tried to throw out the three brewos, but they produced more crumpled scrip, which closest scrutiny couldn\u0027t prove counterfeit. In revenge he short-squirted them and there were arguments. He called Spar off his sweeping to ask him nervously, \"That cat of yours - he scratched Crown, didn\u0027t he? We\u0027ll have to get rid of him; Crown said he might be a witch cat, remember?\" Spar made no answer. Keeper set him renewing the glue of the emergency hatches, claiming that Rixende\u0027s tearing free from the aft one had shown it must be drying out. He gobbled appetizers and drank moonmist with tomato juice. He sprayed the Bat Rack with some abominable synthetic scent. He started counting the boxed scrip and coins but gave up the job with a slam of self-locking drawer almost before he\u0027d begun. His grimace fixed on Suzy.\\n\\n \"Spar!\" he called. \"Take over! And over-squirt the brewos on your peril!\"\\n\\n Then he locked the cash box, and giving Suzy a meaningful jerk of his head toward the scarlet starboard hatch, he pulled himself toward it. With an unhappy shrug toward Spar, she wearily followed.\\n\\n As soon as the pair were gone, Spar gave the brewos an eight-second squirt, waving back their scrip, and placed two small serving cages - of fritos and yeast balls - before them. They granted their thanks and fell to. The light changed from healthy bright to corpse white. There was a faint, distant roar, followed some seconds later by a brief crescendo of creakings. The new light made Spar uneasy. He served two more suck-and-dives and sold a pouch of moonmist at double purser\u0027s prices. He started to eat an appetizer, but just then Kim swam in to show him proudly a mouse. He conquered his nausea, but began to dread the onset of real withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\n A pot-bellied figure clad in sober black dragged itself along the ratlines from the green hatch. On the aloft side of the bar there appeared a visage in which the blur of white hair and beard almost hid leather-brown flesh, though accentuating the blurs of gray eyes.\\n\\n \"Doc!\" Spar greeted, his misery and unease gone, and instantly handed out a chill pouch of three-star moonbrew. Yet all he could think to say in his excitement was the banal, \"A bad Sleepday night, eh, Doc? Vamps and - \"\\n\\n \" - And other doltish superstitions, which wax every sunth, but never wane,\" an amiable, cynical old voice cut in. \"Yet, I suppose I shouldn\u0027t rob you of your illusions, Spar, even the terrifying ones. You\u0027ve little enough to live by, as it is. And there is viciousness astir in Windrush. Ah, that smacks good against my tonsils.\"\\n\\n Then Spar remembered the important thing. Reaching deep inside his slopsuit, he brought out, in such a way as to hide it from the brewos below, a small flat narrow black bag.\\n\\n \"Here, Doc,\" he whispered, \"you lost it last Playday. I kept it safe for you.\"\\n\\n \"Dammit, I\u0027d lose my jumpers, if I ever took them off,\" Doc commented, hushing his voice when Spar put finger to lips. \"I suppose I started mixing moonmist with my moonbrew - again?\"\\n\\n \"You did, Doc. But you didn\u0027t lose your bag. Crown or one of his girls lifted it, or snagged it when it sat loose beside you. And then I... I, Doc, lifted it from Crown\u0027s hip pocket. Yes, and kept that secret when Rixende and Crown came in demanding it this morning.\"\\n\\n \"Spar, my boy, I am deeply in your debt,\" Doc said. \"More than you can know. Another three-star, please. Ah, nectar. Spar, ask any reward of me, and if it lies merely within the realm of the first transfinite infinity, I will grant it.\"\\n\\n To his own surprise, Spar began to shake - with excitement. Pulling himself forward halfway across the bar, he whispered hoarsely, \"Give me good eyes, Doc!\" adding impulsively, \"and teeth!\"\\n\\n After what seemed a long while, Doc said in a dreamy, sorrowful voice, \"In the Old Days, that would have been easy. They\u0027d perfected eye transplants. They could regenerate cranial nerves, and sometimes restore scanning power to an injured cerebrum. While transplanting tooth buds from a stillborn was intern\u0027s play. But now... Oh, I might be able to do what you ask in an uncomfortable, antique, inorganic fashion, but...\" He broke off on a note that spoke of the misery of life and the uselessness of all effort.\\n\\n \"The Old Days,\" one brewo said from the corner of his mouth to the brewo next to him. \"Witch talk!\"\\n\\n \"Witch-smitch!\" the second brewo replied in like fashion. \"The flesh mechanic\u0027s only senile. He dreams all four days, not just Sleepday.\"\\n\\n The third brewo whistled against the evil eye a tune like the wind.\\n\\n Spar tugged at the long-armed sleeve of Doc\u0027s black jumper. \"Doc, you promised. I want to see sharp, bite sharp!\"\\n\\n Doc laid his shrunken hand commiseratingly on Spar\u0027s forearm. \"Spar,\" he said softly, \"seeing sharply would only make you very unhappy. Believe me, I know. Life\u0027s easier to bear when things are blurred, just as it\u0027s best when thoughts are blurred by brew or mist. And while there are people in Windrush who yearn to bite sharply, you are not their kind. Another three-star, if you please.\"\\n\\n \"I quit moonmist this morning, Doc,\" Spar said somewhat proudly as he handed over the fresh pouch.\\n\\n Doc answered with sad smile, \"Many quit moonmist every Workday morning and change their minds when Playday comes around.\"\\n\\n \"Not me, Doc! Besides,\" Spar argued, \"Keeper and Crown and his girls and even Suzy all see sharply, and they aren\u0027t unhappy.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you a secret, Spar,\" Doc replied. \"Keeper and Crown and the girls are all zombies. Yes, even Crown with his cunning and power. To them Windrush is the universe.\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t, Doc?\"\\n\\n Ignoring the interruption, Doc continued, \"But you wouldn\u0027t be like that, Spar. You\u0027d want to know more. And that would make you far unhappier than you are.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care, Doc,\" Spar said. He repeated accusingly, \"You promised.\"\\n\\n The gray blurs of Doc\u0027s eyes almost vanished as he frowned in thought. Then he said, \"How would this be, Spar? I know moonmist brings pains and sufferings as well as easings and joys. But suppose that every Workday morning and Loafday noon I should bring you a tiny pill that would give you all the good effects of moonmist and none of the bad. I\u0027ve one in this bag. Try it now and see. And every Playday night I would bring you without fail another sort of pill that would make you sleep soundly with never a nightmare. Much better than eyes and teeth. Think it over.\"\\n\\n As Spar considered that, Kim drifted up. He eyed Doc with his close-set green blurs. \"Resspectfful greetingss, ssir,\" he hissed. \"Name izz Kim.\"\\n\\n Doc answered, \"The same to you, sir. May mice be ever abundant.\" He softly stroked the cat, beginning with Kim\u0027s chin and chest. The dreaminess returned to his voice. \"In the Old Days, all cats talked, not just a few sports. The entire feline tribe. And many dogs, too - pardon me, Kim. While as for dolphins and whales and apes...\"\\n\\n Spar said eagerly, \"Answer me one question, Doc. If your pills give happiness without hangover, why do you always drink moonbrew yourself and sometimes spike it with moonmist?\"\\n\\n \"Because for me - \" Doc began and then broke off with a grin. \"You\u0027ve trapped me, Spar. I never thought you used your mind. Very well, on your own mind be it. Come to my office this Loafday - you know the way? Good! - and we\u0027ll see what we can do about your eyes and teeth. And now a double pouch for the corridor.\"\\n\\n He paid in bright coins, thrust the big squunchy three-star in a big pocket, said, \"See you, Spar. So long, Kim,\" and tugged himself toward the green hatch, zig-zagging.\\n\\n \"Ffarewell, ssir,\" Kim hissed after him.\\n\\n Spar held out the small black bag. \"You forgot it again, Doc.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows/page-4.html","bookId":1609,"book":{"id":1609,"title":"Ship of Shadows","description":"Storyline: The fourfold sting of the eye teeth balanced the gut-wretchedness of his looming hangover, so that Spar\u0027s mind floated as free as his body in the blackness of Windrush, in which shone only a couple of running lights dim as churning dream-glow and infinitely distant as the Bridge or the Stern.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ship-of-shadows.jpg","author":"Fritz Leiber","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:44 PM"}}
