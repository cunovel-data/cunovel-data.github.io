Who\u0027s your passenger, grandpa?\" \"Only my cat, Ensign,\" Spar breathed in alarm. \"Well, take the black shaft down.\" Spar began to move across the monkey jungle in the direction pointed out by the blue arm-blur. \"And next time remember animals aren\u0027t allowed on the Bridge.\" As Spar traveled below, his warm relief that Ensign Drake had seemed quite human and compassionate was mixed with anxiety as to whether he still had time to visit Doc. He almost missed the shift to the gang-line grinding aft in the dark red main drag. The corpse-light brightening into the false dawn of late afternoon bothered him. Once more he passed the tumbling bent figure, this time croaking, \"Trinity, Trellis, Wheat Ear...\" He was fighting down the urge to give up his visit to Doc and pull home to the Bat Rack, when he noticed he had passed the second squeeze and was in Hold Four with the passageway to Doc\u0027s coming up. He dove off, checked himself on a shroud and began the hand-drag to Doc\u0027s office, as far larboard as Crown\u0027s Hole was starboard. He passed two figures clumsy on the line, their breaths malty in anticipation of Playday. Spar worried that Doc might have closed his office. He smelled soil and greenery again, from the Gardens of Diana. The hatch was shut, but when Spar pressed the bulb, it unzipped after three honks, and the white-haloed gray-eyed face peered out. \"I\u0027d just about give up on you, Spar.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Doc. I had to - \" \"No matter. Come in, come in. Hello, Kim - take a look around if you want.\" Kim crawled out, pushed off from Spar\u0027s chest, and soon was engaged in a typical cat\u0027s tour of inspection. And there was a great deal to inspect, as even Spar could see. Every shroud in Doc\u0027s office seemed to have objects clipped along its entire length. There were blobs large and small, gleaming and dull, light and dark, translucent and solid. They were silhouetted against a wall of the corpse-light Spar feared, but had no time to think of now. At one end was a band of even brighter light. \"Careful Kim!\" Spar called to the cat as he landed against a shroud and began to paw his way from blob to blob. \"He\u0027s all right,\" Doc said. \"Let\u0027s have a look at you, Spar. Keep your eyes open.\" Doc\u0027s hands held Spar\u0027s head. The gray eyes and leathery face came so close they were one blur. \"Keep them open, I said. Yes, I know you have to blink them, that\u0027s all right. Just as I thought. The lenses are dissolved. You\u0027ve suffered the side-effect which one in ten do who are infected with the Lethean rickettsia.\" \"Styx ricks, Doc?\" \"That\u0027s right, though the mob\u0027s got hold of the wrong river in the Underworld. But we\u0027ve all had it. We\u0027ve all drunk the water of Lethe. Though sometimes when we grow very old we begin to remember the beginning. Don\u0027t squirm.\" \"Hey, Doc, is it because I\u0027ve had the Styx ricks I can\u0027t remember anything back before the Bat Rack?\" \"It could be. How long have you been at the Rack?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Doc. Forever.\" \"Before I found the place, anyhow. When the Rumdum closed here in Four. But that\u0027s only a starth ago.\" \"But I\u0027m awful old, Doc. Why don\u0027t I start remembering?\" \"You\u0027re not old, Spar. You\u0027re just bald and toothless and etched by moonmist and your muscles have shriveled. Yes, and your mind has shriveled too. Now open your mouth.\" One of Doc\u0027s hands went to the back of Spar\u0027s neck. The other probed. \"Your gums are tough, anyhow. That\u0027ll make it easier.\" Spar wanted to tell about the salt water, but when Doc finally took his hand out of Spar\u0027s mouth, it was to say, \"Now open wide as you can.\" Doc pushed into his mouth something big as a handbag and hot. \"Now bite down hard.\" Spar felt as if he had bitten fire. He tried to open his mouth, but hands on his head and jaw held it closed. Involuntarily he kicked and clawed air. His eyes filled with tears. \"Stop writhing! Breathe through your nose. It\u0027s not that hot. Not hot enough to blister, anyhow.\" Spar doubted that, but after a bit decided it wasn\u0027t quite hot enough to bake his brain through the roof of his mouth. Besides, he didn\u0027t want to show Doc his cowardice. He held still. He blinked several times and the general blur became the blurs of Doc\u0027s face and the cluttered room silhouetted by the corpse-glare. He tried to smile, but his lips were already stretched wider than their muscles could ever have done. That hurt too; he realized now that the heat was abating a little. Doc was grinning for him. \"Well, you would ask an old drunkard to use techniques he\u0027d only read about. To make it up to you, I\u0027ll give you teeth sharp enough to sever shrouds. Kim, please get away from that bag.\" The black blur of the cat was pushing off from a black blur twice his length. Spar mumbled disapprovingly at Kim through his nose and made motions. The larger blur was shaped like Doc\u0027s little bag, but bigger than a hundred of them. It must be massive too, for in reaction to Kim\u0027s push it had bent the shroud to which it was attached and - the point - the shroud was very slow in straightening. \"That bag contains my treasure, Spar,\" Doc explained, and when Spar lifted his eyebrows twice to signal another question, went on, \"No, not coin and gold and jewels, but a second transfinite infinitude - sleep and dreams and nightmares for every soul in a thousand Windrushes.\" He glanced at his wrist. \"Time enough now. Open your mouth.\" Spar obeyed, though it cost him new pain. Doc withdrew what Spar had bitten on, wrapped it in gleam, and clipped it to the nearest shroud. Then he looked in Spar\u0027s mouth again. \"I guess I did make it a bit too hot,\" he said. He found a small pouch, set it to Spar\u0027s lips, and squeezed it. A mist filled Spar\u0027s mouth and all pain vanished. Doc tucked the pouch in Spar\u0027s pocket. \"If the pain returns, use it again.\" But before Spar could thank Doc, the latter had pressed a tube to his eye. \"Look, Spar, what do you see?\" Spar cried out, he couldn\u0027t help it, and jerked his eye away. \"What\u0027s wrong, Spar?\" \"Doc you gave me a dream,\" Spar said hoarsely. \"You won\u0027t tell anyone, will you? And it tickled.\" \"What was the dream like?\" Doc asked eagerly. \"Just a picture, Doc. The picture of a goat with the tail of a fish. Doc, I saw the fish\u0027s...\" His mind groped, \"... scales! Everything had... edges! Doc, is that what they mean when they talk about seeing sharply?\" \"Of course, Spar. This is good. It means there\u0027s no cerebral or retinal damage. I\u0027ll have no trouble making up field glasses - that is, if there\u0027s nothing seriously wrong with my antique pair. So you still see things sharp-edged in dreams - that\u0027s natural enough. But why were you afraid of me telling?\" \"Afraid of being accused of witchcraft, Doc. I thought seeing things like that was clairvoyance. The tube tickled my eye a little.\" \"Isotopes and insanity! It\u0027s supposed to tickle. That\u0027s the field. Let\u0027s try the other eye.\" Again Spar wanted to cry out, but he restrained himself, and this time he had no impulse to jerk his eye away, although there was again the faint tickling. The picture was that of a slim girl. He could tell she was female because of her general shape. But he could see her edges. He could see... details. For instances, her eyes weren\u0027t mist-bounded colored ovals. They had points at both ends, which were china-white... triangles. And the pale violet round between the triangles had a tiny black round at its center. She had silvery hair, yet she looked young, he thought, though it was hard to judge such matters when you could see edges. She made him think of the platinum-haired girl he\u0027d glimpsed in Crown\u0027s Hole. She wore a long, gleaming white dress, which left her shoulders bare, but either art or some unknown force had drawn her hair and her dress toward her feet. In her dress it made... folds. \"What\u0027s her name, Doc? Almodie?\" \"No. Virgo. The Virgin. You can see her edges?\" \"Yes, Doc. Sharp. I get it! - like a knife. And the goat-fish?\" \"Capricorn,\" Doc answered, removing the tube from Spar\u0027s eye. \"Doc, I know Capricorn and Virgo are the names of lunths, terranths, sunths, and starths, but I never knew they had pictures. I never knew they were anything.\" \"You - Of course, you\u0027ve never seen watches, or stars, let alone the constellations of the zodiac.\" Spar was about to ask what all those were, but then he saw that the corpse-light was all gone, although the ribbon of brighter light had grown very wide. \"At least in this stretch of your memory,\" Doc added. \"I should have your new eyes and teeth ready next Loafday. Come earlier if you can manage. I may see you before that at the Bat Rack, Playday night or earlier.\" \"Great, Doc, but now I\u0027ve got to haul. Come on, Kim! Sometimes business heavies up Loafday night, Doc, like it was Playday night come at the wrong end. Jump in, Kim.\" \"Sure you can make it back to the Bat Rack all right, Spar? It\u0027ll be dark before you get there.\" \"Course I can, Doc.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows/page-6.html","bookId":1609,"book":{"id":1609,"title":"Ship of Shadows","description":"Storyline: The fourfold sting of the eye teeth balanced the gut-wretchedness of his looming hangover, so that Spar\u0027s mind floated as free as his body in the blackness of Windrush, in which shone only a couple of running lights dim as churning dream-glow and infinitely distant as the Bridge or the Stern.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ship-of-shadows.jpg","author":"Fritz Leiber","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:44 PM"}}
