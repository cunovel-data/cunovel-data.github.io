{"id":93033,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\"Issiot! Fffool! Lushshsh!\" hissed the cat and bit Spar somewhere. The fourfold sting of the eye teeth balanced the gut-wretchedness of his looming hangover, so that Spar\u0027s mind floated as free as his body in the blackness of Windrush, in which shone only a couple of running lights dim as churning dream-glow and infinitely distant as the Bridge or the Stern. The vision came of a ship with all sails set creaming through blue, wind-ruffled sea against a blue sky. The last two nouns were not obscene now. He could hear the whistle of the salty wind through shrouds and stays, its drumming against the taut sails, and the creak of the three masts and all the rest of the ship\u0027s wood. What was wood? From somewhere came the answer: plastic alive-o. And what force flattened the water and kept it from breaking up into great globules and the ship from spinning away, keel over masts, in the wind? Instead of being blurred and rounded like reality, the vision was sharp-edged and bright - the sort Spar never told, for fear of being accused of second sight and so of witchcraft. Windrush was a ship too, was often called the Ship. But it was a strange sort of ship, in which the sailors lived forever in the shrouds inside cabins of all shapes made of translucent sails welded together. And it was a ship that was not sailing anywhere, because it had everywhere in it - it was all there was. The only other things the two ships shared were the wind and the unending creaking. As the vision faded, Spar began to hear the winds of Windrush softly moaning through the long passageways, while he felt the creaking in the vibrant shroud to which he was clipped wrist and ankle to keep him from floating around in the Bat Rack. Sleepday\u0027s dreams had begun good, with Spar having Crown\u0027s three girls at once. But Sleepday night he had been half-waked by the distant grinding of Hold Three\u0027s big chewer. Then werewolves and vampires had attacked him, solid shadows diving in from all six corners, while witches and their familiars tittered in the black shadowy background. Somehow he had been protected by the cat, familiar of a slim witch whose bared teeth had been an ivory blur in the larger silver blur of her wild hair. Spar pressed his rubbery gums together. The cat had been the last of the supernatural creatures to fade. Then had come the beautiful vision of the ship. His hangover hit him suddenly and mercilessly. Sweat shook off him until he must be surrounded by a cloud of it. Without warning his gut reversed. His free hand found a floating waste tube in time to press its small trumpet to his face. He could hear his acrid vomit gurgling away, urged by a light suction. His gut reversed again, quick as the flap of a safety hatch when a gale blows up in the corridors. He thrust the waste tube inside the leg of his short, loose slopsuit and caught the dark stuff, almost as watery and quite as explosive as his vomit. Then he had the burning urge to make water. Afterwards, feeling blessedly weak, Spar curled up in the equally blessed dark and prepared to snooze until Keeper woke him. \"Sssot!\" hissed the cat. \"Sssleep no more! Sssee! Sssee shshsharply!\" In his left shoulder, through the worn fabric of his slopsuit, Spar could feel four sets of prickles, like the touch of small thorn clusters in the Gardens of Apollo or Diana. He froze. \"Sspar,\" the cat hissed more softly, quitting to prickle. \"I wishsh you all besst. Mosst ashshuredly.\" Spar warily reached his right hand across his chest, touched short fur softer than Suzy\u0027s, and stroked gingerly. The cat hissed very softly, almost purring, \"Ssturdy Sspar! Ssee ffar! Ssee fforever! Fforessee! Afftssee!\" Spar felt a surge of irritation at this constant talk of seeing - bad manners in the cat! - followed by an irrational surge of hope about his eyes. He decided that this was no witch cat left over from his dream, but a stray which had wormed its way through a wind tube into the Bat Rack, setting off his dream. There were quite a few animal strays in these days of the witch panic and the depopulation of the Ship, or at least of Hold Three. Dawn struck the Bow then, for the violet fore-corner of the Bat Rack began to glow. The running lights were drowned in a growing white blaze. Within twenty heartbeats Windrush was bright as it ever would be on Workday or any other morning. Out along Spar\u0027s arm moved the cat, a black blur to his squinting eyes. In teeth Spar could not see, it held a smaller gray blur. Spar touched the latter. It was even shorter furred, but cold. As if irked, the cat took off from his bare forearm with a strong push of hind legs. It landed expertly on the next shroud a wavery line of gray that vanished in either direction before reaching a wall. Spar unclipped himself, curled his toes round his own pencil-thin shroud, and squinted at the cat. The cat stared back with eyes that were green blurs which almost coalesced in the black blur of its outsize head. Spar asked, \"Your child? Dead?\" The cat loosed its gray burden, which floated beside its head. \"Chchchchild!\" All the former scorn and more were back in the sibilant voice. \"It izzzz a rat I sssslew her, issssiot!\" Spar\u0027s lips puckered in a smile. \"I like you, cat. I will call you Kim.\" \"Kim-shlim!\" the cat spat. \"I\u0027ll call you Lushshsh! Or Sssot!\" The creaking increased, as it always did after dayspring and noon. Shrouds twanged. Walls crackled. Spar swiftly swiveled his head. Though reality was by its nature a blur, he could unerringly spot movement. Keeper was slowly floating straight at him. On the round of his russet body was mounted the great, pale round of his face, its bright pink target-center drawing attention from the tiny, wide-set, brown blurs of his eyes. One of his fat arms ended in the bright gleam of pliofilm, the other in the dark gleam of steel. Far beyond him was the dark red aft corner of the Bat Rack, with the great gleaming torus, or doughnut, of the bar midway between. \"Lazy, pampered he-slut,\" Keeper greeted. \"All Sleepday you snored while I stood guard, and now I bring your morning pouch of moonmist to your sleeping shroud. \"A bad night, Spar,\" he went on, his voice growing sententious. \"Werewolves, vampires, and witches loose in the corridors. But I stood them off, not to mention rats and mice. I heard through the tubes that the vamps got Girlie and Sweetheart, the silly sluts! Vigilance, Spar! Now suck your moonmist and start sweeping. The place stinks.\" He stretched out the pliofilm-gleaming hand. His mind hissing with Kim\u0027s contemptuous words, Spar said, \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll drink this morning, Keeper. Corn gruel and moonbrew only. No, water.\" \"What, Spar?\" Keeper demanded. \"I don\u0027t believe I can allow that. We don\u0027t want you having convulsions in front of the customers. Earth strangle me! - what\u0027s that?\" Spar instantly launched himself at Keeper\u0027s steel-gleaming hand. Behind him his shroud twanged. With one hand he twisted a cold, thick barrel. With the other he pried a plump finger from a trigger. \"He\u0027s not a witch cat, only a stray,\" he said as they tumbled over and kept slowly rotating. \"Unhand me, underling!\" Keeper blustered. \"I\u0027ll have you in irons. I\u0027ll tell Crown.\" \"Shooting weapons are as much against the law as knives or needles,\" Spar countered boldly, though he already was feeling dizzy and sick. \"It\u0027s you should fear the brig.\" He recognized beneath the bullying voice the awe Keeper always had of his ability to move swiftly and surely, though half-blind. They bounced to rest against a swarm of shrouds. \"Loose me, I say,\" Keeper demanded, struggling weakly. \"Crown gave me this pistol. And I have a permit for it from the Bridge.\" The last at least, Spar guessed, was a lie. Keeper continued, \"Besides, it\u0027s only a line-shooting gun reworked for heavy, elastic ball. Not enough to rupture a wall, yet sufficient to knock out drunks - or knock in the head of a witch cat!\" \"Not a witch cat, Keeper,\" Spar repeated, although he was having to swallow hard to keep from spewing. \"Only a well-behaved stray, who has already proved his use to us by killing one of the rats that have been stealing our food. His name is Kim. He\u0027ll be a good worker.\" The distant blur of Kim lengthened and showed thin blurs of legs and tail, as if he were standing out rampant from his line. \"Assset izz I,\" he boasted. \"Ssanitary. Uzze wasste tubes. Sslay ratss, micece! Sspy out witchchess, vampss ffor you!\" \"He speaks!\" Keeper gasped. \"Witchcraft!\" \"Crown has a dog who talks,\" Spar answered with finality. \"A talking animal\u0027s no proof of anything.\" All this while he had kept firm hold of barrel and finger. Now he felt through their grappled bodies a change in Keeper, as though inside his blubber the master of the Bat Rack were transforming from stocky muscle and bone into a very thick, sweet syrup that could conform to and flow around anything. \"Sorry, Spar,\" he whispered unctuously. \"It was a bad night and Kim startled me. He\u0027s black like a witch cat. An easy mistake on my part. We\u0027ll try him out at catcher. He must earn his keep! Now take your drink.\" The pliant double pouch filling Spar\u0027s palm felt like the philosopher\u0027s stone. He lifted it toward his lips, but at the same time his toes unwittingly found a shroud, and he dove swiftly toward the shining torus, which had a hole big enough to accommodate four barmen at a pinch. Spar collapsed against the opposite inside of the hole. With a straining of its shrouds, the torus absorbed his impact. He had the pouch to his lips, its cap unscrewed, but had not squeezed. He shut his eyes and with a tiny sob blindly thrust the pouch back into the moonmist cage. Working chiefly by touch, he took a pouch of corn gruel from the hot closet, snitching at the same time a pouch of coffee and thrusting it into an inside pocket. Then he took a pouch of water, opened it, shoved in five salt tablets, closed it, and shook and squeezed it vigorously. Keeper, having drifted behind him, said into his ear, \"So you drink anyhow. Moonmist not good enough, you make yourself a cocktail. I should dock it from your scrip. But all drunks are liars, or become so.\" Unable to ignore the taunt, Spar explained, \"No, only salt water to harden my gums.\" \"Poor Spar, what\u0027ll you ever need hard gums for? Planning to share rats with your new friend? Don\u0027t let me catch you roasting them in my grill! I should dock you for the salt. To sweeping, Spar!\" Then turning his head toward the violet fore-corner and speaking loudly, \"And you! Catch mice!\" Kim had already found the small chewer tube and thrust the dead rat into it, gripping tube with foreclaws and pushing rat with aft. At the touch of the rat\u0027s cadaver against the solid wrist of the tube, a grinding began there which would continue until the rat was macerated and slowly swallowed away toward the great cloaca which fed the Gardens of Diana. Three times Spar manfully swished salt water against his gums and spat into a waste tube, vomiting a little after the first gargle. Then facing away from Keeper as he gently squeezed the pouches, he forced into his throat the coffee - dearer than moonmist, the drink distilled from moonbrew - and some of the corn gruel.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows/page-1.html","bookId":1609,"book":{"id":1609,"title":"Ship of Shadows","description":"Storyline: The fourfold sting of the eye teeth balanced the gut-wretchedness of his looming hangover, so that Spar\u0027s mind floated as free as his body in the blackness of Windrush, in which shone only a couple of running lights dim as churning dream-glow and infinitely distant as the Bridge or the Stern.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ship-of-shadows.jpg","author":"Fritz Leiber","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:44 PM"}}
