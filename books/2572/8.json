{"id":93189,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Tell me about your husband Rama?\" Ray asks as we drive toward the warehouse. \"And your daughter, Lalita?\"\n The question takes me by surprise. \"It was a long time ago.\"\n \"But you remember everything?\"\n \"Yes.\" I sit silently for a moment. \"I was almost twenty when we met. Three or four times a year merchants used to pass by that portion of India that is now known as Rajastan. We lived between the desert and the jungle. The merchants would sell us hats to keep off the sun, herb potions to drive away the bugs. Rama was the son of a merchant. I first saw him by the river that flowed beside our village. He was teaching a small child how to fly a kite. We had kites in those days. We invented them, not the Chinese.\" I shake my head. \"When I saw him, I just knew.\"\n Ray understands but asks anyway, anxious to dwell on my humanity in the light of what happened at the beach. \"What did you know?\"\n \"That I loved him. That we belonged together.\" I smile at the memory. \"He was named after an earlier incarnation of Lord Vishnu-the eighth avatar, or incarnation of God. Lord Rama was married to the Goddess Sita. Krishna was supposed to be the ninth avatar. I worshipped Lord Vishnu from the time I was born. Maybe that\u0027s why I got to meet Krishna. Any?way, you can see how Rama\u0027s and my names went together. Maybe our union was destined to be. Rama was like you in a lot of ways. Quiet, given to thought?ful pauses.\" I glance over. \"He even had your eyes.\"\n \"They were the same?\"\n \"They did not look the same. But they were the same. You understand?\"\n \"Yes. Tell me about Lalita?\"\n \"Lalita is one of the names of the Goddess as well. It means \u0027She who plays.\u0027 She was up to mischief the moment she came out of my womb. Ten months old and she would climb out of her cradle and crawl and walk all the way to the river.\" I chuckle. \"I remember once I found her sitting with a snake in one of the small boats our people had. Fortunately the snake was asleep. It was poisonous! I remember how fright?ened I was.\" I sigh. \"You wouldn\u0027t have known me in those days.\"\n \"I wish I had known you then.\"\n His remark is sweet-he means it that way-yet it stings. My hands fidget on the steering wheel. \"I wish many things,\" I whisper.\n \"Do you believe in reincarnation?\" he asks sud?denly.\n \"Why do you ask?\"\n \"Just curious. Do you?\"\n I consider. \"I know Krishna said it was a reality. Looking back, I believe he always spoke the truth. But I never talked to him about it. I scarcely talked to him at all.\"\n \"If reincarnation is a reality, then what about us? Are we evolving toward God? Or are we stuck because we\u0027re afraid to die?\"\n \"I have asked myself the same questions, many times. But I\u0027ve never been able to answer them.\"\n \"Can\u0027t you at least answer one of them?\"\n \"Which one is that?\" I ask.\n \"Are you afraid?\"\n I reach over and take his hand. \"I don\u0027t fear death for myself.\"\n \"But to fear it at all-isn\u0027t it the same difference? If you trust Krishna, then you must trust that there is no death.\"\n I force a smile. \"We\u0027re a philosopher tonight.\"\n He smiles. \"Don\u0027t be anxious. I\u0027m not thinking of suicide. I just think we have to look at the bigger picture.\"\n I squeeze his hand and let go. \"I believe Krishna saw all of life as nothing more than a motion picture projected onto a vast screen. Certainly nothing in this world daunted him. Even when I held his companion, Radha, in my clutches, he never lost his serenity.\"\n Ray nods. \"I would like to have such peace of mind.\"\n \"Yes. So would I.\"\n His reaches over and touches my long hair. \"Do you think I am Rama?\"\n I have to take a breath. My eyes moisten. My words come out weak. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"Yes, you do. Did I come back for you?\"\n There are tears on my face. They are five thousand years old. I remember them. After Yaksha changed me, I saw neither my husband nor my daughter again. How I hated him for doing that to me. Yet, had I never become a vampire, I never would have met Ray. But I shake my head at his questions.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I say.\n \"Sita-\"\n \"When I met you,\" I interrupt, \"I felt as if Krishna had led me to you.\" I reach up and press his hand to the side of my face. \"You feel like Rama. You smell like him.\"\n He leans over and kisses my ear. \"You\u0027re great.\"\n \"You\u0027re wonderful.\"\n He brushes away my tears. \"They always paint Krishna as blue. I know you explained that it\u0027s symbolic. That he is blue like the vast sky- unbounded. But I dream about him sometimes, when you lie beside me. And when I do, his eyes are always blue, like shining stars.\" He pauses. \"Have you ever had such a dream?\"\n I nod.\n \"Tell me about it?\"\n \"Maybe later.\"\n \"All right. But didn\u0027t your husband die before he could have met Krishna?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"So I can\u0027t be remembering a past life?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I wouldn\u0027t think so.\"\n Ray lets go of me and sits back, seemingly disap?pointed. He adds casually, \"I never dream of blood. Do you?\"\n Often, I think. Maybe once, five thousand years ago, we had more in common. Yet I lie to him, even though I hate to lie to those I love. Even though I have promised myself and him that I would stop.\n \"No,\" I say. \"Never.\"\n We park two blocks away from the warehouse, a gray rectangular structure as long as a football field, as tall as a lighthouse. But no light emanates from this building. The exterior walls are rotting wood, moldy plaster, panes of glass so drenched in dust they could be squares etched on the walls of a coal mine. The surrounding fence is tall, barbed-a good stretch of wire on which to hang fresh corpses. Yet the occupants are more subtle than that, but not a lot more. Even from this distance I smell the decaying bodies they have ravaged inside, and I know the police and the\n FBI are seriously underestimating Los Angeles\u0027s re?cent violent crime wave. The odor of the yakshini, the snakes from beyond the black vault of the universe, also wafts from the building. I estimate a dozen vampires inside. But is Eddie one of them? And how many of his partners presently walk the streets? Vicious dogs wander the perimeter. They look well fed.\n \"Do you have a plan?\" Ray asks.\n \"Always.\"\n \"I want to be part of it.\"\n I nod. \"You realize the danger.\"\n \"I just have to look in the mirror, sister.\"\n I smile. \"We have to burn this building down with all of them inside. To do that we need large quantities of gasoline, and the only way we are going to get that is to steal a couple of gasoline trucks from a nearby refinery.\"\n \"With our good looks and biting wit, that shouldn\u0027t be too hard.\"\n \"Indeed. The hard part will come when we try to plant our trucks at either end of the building and ignite them. First we\u0027ll have to cut the fence, so we can drive in unobstructed, and to do that we will have to silently kill all the dogs. But I think I can take them out from this distance using a silencer on one of my rifles.\"\n Ray winces. \"Is that necessary?\"\n \"Yes. Better a few dead dogs than the end of human?ity. The main thing is, we must attack after dawn, when they\u0027re all back inside and feeling sleepy. That includes our prize policymaker-Eddie.\"\n \"I like to take a nap at that time myself,\" Ray remarks.\n I speak seriously. \"You are going to have to be strong with the sun in the sky, and drive one of the trucks. I know that won\u0027t be easy for you. But if all goes well, you can seek shelter immediately after?ward.\"\n He nods. \"Sounds like a piece of cake.\"\n \"No. It\u0027s a baked Alaska.\" I study the structure and nod. \"They\u0027ll burn.\"\n Yet my confidence is a costume. The previous night, when I stared into Eddie\u0027s eyes, he seemed insane, but also shrewd. The ease with which we have found him and his people disturbs me. The stage is set for a snuff film, big time. But I have to wonder who is directing the show. Whether it will go straight onto the front pages of the Los Angeles Times. Or end up buried in video, in Eddie\u0027s private collection. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/black-blood-the-last-vampire-2/page-8.html","bookId":2572,"book":{"id":2572,"title":"Black Blood (The Last Vampire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Black Blood (The Last Vampire #2) \n The terrifying sequel to The Last Vampire.
