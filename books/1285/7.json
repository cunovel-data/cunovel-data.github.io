{"id":20843,"no":7,"title":"VII UNDER AN UMBRELLA","content":"The entrance-gates to the yard of Daphut, the builder and stonemason, which lay between Mrs. Arb\u0027s shop and the steps proper, were set back a little from the general frontage of the north side of Riceyman Steps, so that there was a corner at that point sheltered from east and north-east winds. In this corner stood a young man under an old umbrella; his clothes were such as would have entitled him to the newspaper reporter\u0027s description, \"respectably dressed\"—no better. His back was against the blind wall of Mrs. Arb\u0027s. It was raining again, with a squally wind, but the wind being in the north-east the young man was only getting spotted with rain. A young woman ran out of Mrs. Arb\u0027s and joined him. She placed herself close to him, touching him, breast to breast; it was the natural and rational thing to do, and also she had to receive as much protection as possible from the umbrella. The girl was wearing all Elsie\u0027s clothes. Elsie\u0027s sack-apron covered her head and shoulders like a bridal veil. But she was not Mrs. Arb\u0027s Elsie nor Mr. Earlforward\u0027s! She was not the drudge. She had suddenly become a celestial visitant. The attributes of such an unearthly being were in her shining face and in the solace of her little bodily movements; and her extraordinary mean and ugly apparel could not impair them in the least. The man, slowly, hesitatingly, put one arm round her waist—the other was occupied with the umbrella. She yielded her waist to him, and looked up at the man, and he looked down at her. Not a word. Then he said in a deep voice: \"Where\u0027s your hat—and things?\"[Pg 31] He said this as one who apprehended calamity. \"I haven\u0027t finished yet,\" she answered gently. \"I\u0027m that sorry.\" \"How long shall you be?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Joe. She\u0027s all by herself, and she begged and prayed me to stop on and help her. She\u0027s all by herself, and strange to it. And I couldn\u0027t find it in my heart to refuse. You have to do what\u0027s right, haven\u0027t you?\" The man\u0027s chin fell in a sort of sulky and despairing gloom; but he said nothing; he was not a facile talker, even on his best days. She took the umbrella from him without altering its position. \"Put both arms round me, and hold me tight,\" she murmured. He obeyed, reluctantly, tardily, but in the end fiercely. After a long pause he said: \"And my birthday and all!\" \"I know! I know!\" she cried. \"Oh, Joe! It can\u0027t be helped!\" He had many arguments, and good ones, against her decision; but he could not utter them. He never could argue. She just gazed up at him softly. Tears began to run down his cheeks. \"Now, now!\" she soothed him. With her free hand she worked up the tail of her apron between them, and, while still fast in his clutch, wiped his eyes delicately. She kissed him, keeping her lips on his. She kissed him until she knew from the feel of his muscles everywhere that the warm soft contact with her had begun to dissolve his resentment. Then she withdrew her lips and kissed him again, differently. They stood motionless in the dark corner under the umbrella, and the rain pattered dully on the umbrella and dropped off the umbrella and round them, and pattered with a brighter sound on the flagstones of Riceyman Steps. A few people passed at intervals up and down the steps. But the clasped pair ignored them; and the wayfarers did not look twice, nor even smile at the lovers, who, in fact, were making love[Pg 32] as honest love is made by lovers whose sole drawing-rooms and sofas are the street. \"Look here, Joe,\" Elsie whispered. \"I want you to go home now. But you must call at Smithson\u0027s on yer way—they don\u0027t close till nine o\u0027clock—and get them braces as I\u0027m giving you for a birthday present. I see \u0027em still in the window this morning. I should have slipped in and bought \u0027em then, but I was on an errand for Mr. Earlforward, and, besides, I didn\u0027t like to, somehow, without you, and me with my apron on too. But you must buy \u0027em to-night so as you can wear \u0027em to-morrow. I want to say to myself to-morrow morning, \u0027He\u0027s wearing them braces.\u0027 I\u0027ve brought you the money.\" She loosed one of his hands from her waist, got at the silver in her pocket, and inserted it into his breast pocket. \"You promise me, Joe? It\u0027s a fair and square promise?\" He made no reply. \"You promise me, darling Joe?\" she insisted. He nodded; he could not speak in his desolation and in his servitude to her. She smiled her lovely thanks for his obedience. \"Now let me see ye start off,\" she cajoled him. \"I know ye. I know what you\u0027ll do if I don\u0027t see you start with me own eyes.\" \"Then it\u0027s to-morrow night?\" he said gruffly. She nodded. They kissed again. Elsie pushed him away, and then stood watching until he had vanished round the corner of the disused Mission Hall into King\u0027s Cross Road. She stood watching, indeed, for some moments after that. She was crying. \"My word!\" said Mrs. Arb vivaciously. \"I was beginning to wonder if you meant to come back, after all. You\u0027ve been that long your tea\u0027ll be cold. Here\u0027s the ham, and very nice it is too.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2798/77398.html","bookId":1285,"book":{"id":1285,"title":"Riceyman Steps","description":"简介： On an autumn afternoon of 1919 a hatless man with a slight limp might have been observed ascending the gentle, broad acclivity of Riceyman Steps, which lead from King\u0027s Cross Road up to Riceyman Square, in the great metropolitan industrial district o...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2798","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM"}}
