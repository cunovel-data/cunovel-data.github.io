{"id":20865,"no":29,"title":"III CHARITY","content":"A dramatic event occurred that same afternoon at the shop. Violet and Henry were together in the office, where the electricity had just been turned on; the shop itself was still depending on nature for light, and lay somewhat obscure in the dusk. Husband and wife were in an affectionate mood, for Violet as usual had been beaten by the man\u0027s extraordinary soft obstinacy. She had had more than one scene of desperation with him about his health and his treatment of himself, but nobody can keep on fighting a cushion for ever. Henry had worn her down into a good temper, into a condition of reassurance and even optimism. He had, in fact, by patience convinced her that his indisposition was temporary and such as none can hope to escape; and that he undoubtedly possessed a constitution of iron. The absence of Elsie helped the intimacy of the pair; they enjoyed being alone, unobserved, free from the constraint of the eyes of a third person who was here, there and everywhere. The trouble was that as soon as the affectionate mood had been established Violet wanted to begin her tactics and her antics all over again. \"You know, darling,\" she said, playful and serious, sitting on the edge of the desk by his side in a manner most unmatronly. \"Either you eat to-morrow, or I shall have the doctor in. Oh! I shall have the doctor in! It\u0027s for you to decide, but I\u0027ve made up my mind. You must admit——\" And then the shop door opened and someone entered. Violet sprang off the desk to the switches, illuminated the shop, and beheld Dr. Raste. Henry also beheld Dr.[Pg 183] Raste. Although a perfectly innocent woman, Violet\u0027s face at once changed to that of a wicked conspirator who has been caught in the act. Try as she would she could not get rid of that demeanour of guilt, and the more she tried the less she succeeded. She dared not look at Henry. Certainly she could not murmur to Henry; \"I swear to you I didn\u0027t send for him. His coming\u0027s just as much a surprise to me as it is to you.\" She thought: \"This is that girl Elsie\u0027s doing.\" And she was angry and resentful against Elsie, and yet timorously glad that Elsie had been interfering. What Henry was thinking no one could guess. Henry\u0027s mind to him a kingdom was, and a kingdom never invaded. All that could be positively stated of Henry was that the moment he recognized the doctor he rose vigorously from his chair and limped about with vivacity to prove that he was not an invalid, or in any way in need of any doctor. And, strange to say, he really felt quite well. Dr. Raste startled Violet by offering to shake hands. \"Ha! How d\u0027ye do, Mrs. Earlforward,\" said he, in his sprightly, professional, high-voiced style. \"Not seen you for a long time.\" Violet recalled the Sunday morning in Riceyman Square when he had spoken to Henry on the pavement. She was happy then, and expectant of happiness. She was girlish then, exuberant, dominating, self-willed, free. None could withstand her. A year ago! The change in twelve months suddenly presented itself to her with a sinister significance; but she imagined that the change was confined to her circumstances, and that an unchanged Violet had survived. The doctor with his fresh eyes saw a shrunken woman, subject to some kind of neurosis which he could not diagnose. He greeted the oncoming Mr. Earlforward, and shook a hand of parchment. Mr. Earlforward\u0027s appearance indeed astonished him, and he said to himself that perhaps he had done well to call, and that anyhow Elsie had not exaggerated her report, Mr. Earlforward was worse than shrunken—he was emaci[Pg 184]ated; his jaws were hollowed, his little eyes had receded, his complexion was greyish, his lips were pale and dry—the lower lip had lost its heavy fullness; his ears were nearly white. And there he was moving nervously about in the determination to be in excellent health in the presence of the doctor. Amazing, thought Dr. Raste, that Mrs. Earlforward had not summoned medical assistance weeks earlier! But then Mrs. Earlforward saw her husband every day and nearly all day. Amazing that no customer had dropped a word of alarm! But then Mr. Earlforwaid\u0027s amiable and bland relations with customers were not such as to permit any kind of intimacy. You got a certain distance with Mr. Earlforward, but you never got any further. \"You remember I bought a Shakspere here last year,\" Dr. Raste began cheerily, and somewhat loudly. (He often spoke more loudly than he need: result of imposing himself on the resistant stupidity of the proletariat.) Relief spread through the shop like a sweet odour. The professional man\u0027s visit was a pure coincidence after all. Violet ceased to look guilty. Henry ceased to ape the person of vigorous health. \"Yes, yes,\" said Mr. Earlforward; and to his wife: \"Just reach down that \u0027Shakspere with Illustrations,\u0027 will you?\" \"Shakspere with Illustrations\" was the shop\u0027s title for the work (Valpy\u0027s edition of Shakspere\u0027s plays and poems), because these three words were the only words on the binding. \"You don\u0027t mean to say you\u0027ve not sold it yet—a year, isn\u0027t it?\" cried Dr. Raste. And Mr. Earlforward recalled from their previous interview in the shop an impression that the doctor was apt to be impudent. What right had the man to express surprise at the work not having been sold? Mr. Earlforward had in stock books bought ten years ago, fifteen years ago. \"I could have sold it,\" said he. \"But the truth is I\u0027ve been keeping it for you. I felt sure you\u0027d be looking[Pg 185] in one of these days. I meant to drop you a postcard to say I\u0027d found it; but somehow——\" All this was true. For at least ten months Mr. Earlforward had intended to drop the postcard, and had never dropped it. Yet his conviction that one day he would drop it had remained fresh and strong throughout the period. \"Here! It\u0027s up in that corner, my dear,\" said Mr. Earlforward. \"Yes, I know. I\u0027m just going to get the steps.\" \"Where are they? They ought to be here.\" \"I don\u0027t know. Elsie must have had them for her windows, and forgotten to bring them back.\" \"Tut, tut!\" Mr. Earlforward blandly expostulated. \"Shakspere\u0027s been having considerable success in my house,\" Dr. Raste went on, when the two men were alone, with an arch smile at his own phrasing. \"You\u0027d scarcely believe it, but my little daughter simply devours him. And as it\u0027s her birthday next week I thought I\u0027d give her my Globe edition for herself, and get another one with a wee bit larger type for myself. My eyes aren\u0027t what they were.... Simply devours him! Scarcely believe it, would you?\" The doctor was growing human. His eyes sparkled with ingenuous paternal pride. Then he checked himself. \"I notice your old clock isn\u0027t going,\" said he, in a more conventional, a conversation-making tone, and glanced at his wrist. \"No,\" Mr. Earlforward quietly admitted, thinking: \"What\u0027s it got to do with you—my \u0027old clock\u0027 not going?\" The clock had not gone for months. Violet, who had further illuminated the shop as she passed out, was rather long in returning, partly because she had had to hunt for the steps, and partly because she had popped into the bedroom to see that it was in order. Dr. Raste gallantly took the volumes from her as she stood half-way up the steps. \"Fifteen volumes—that\u0027s right,\" said Mr. Earlforward. \"I told you there were eight, didn\u0027t I?\"[Pg 186] \"Did you?\" said Dr. Raste, wondering at the bookseller\u0027s memory. \"Yes. I was mixing it up with another edition. Easy to make a mistake of that kind. Well, just look at it. Biography. Notes. Beautiful clear type. Nice, modest binding, in very good taste. Light and handy to hold. Clean as a pin. Nearly two hundred illustrations—from the Boydell edition. I told you Flaxman\u0027s illustrations, didn\u0027t I? Yes, I did. That was wrong. I somehow got the idea they were Flaxman\u0027s because they\u0027re in outline. But I see there\u0027s quite a selection of artists.\" He peered at the names engraved in microscopic characters under the illustrations, and passed on volume after volume to the prospective customer. \"Pretty edition.\" A silence. Violet stood attendant—an acolyte, submissive, watchful—while Henry did business. \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027ll be too dear for my purse,\" said the doctor, affrighted by the thought of nearly two hundred illustrations from Boydell. \"Twenty-five shillings.\" \"I\u0027d better take it,\" said the doctor, looking up from the books into Mr. Earlforward\u0027s little eyes; he was startled at the lowness of the price, and immediately counted out the money—two notes and two new half-crowns, which Mr. Earlforward gazed at passionately, and in a bravura of self-control left lying on the desk. \"Make them up into two parcels, will you?\" said the doctor. \"I\u0027ll carry them home myself. I suppose you wouldn\u0027t be able to deliver to-night? Too late?\" \"Yes. Too late to-night, I\u0027m afraid,\" answered Mr. Earlforward calmly, well aware that he had long since ceased to deliver any goods under any circumstances. \"My dear, some nice brown paper and string. Oh! The string\u0027s here, isn\u0027t it?\" He bent down to a drawer of the desk, and drew out a tangle of all manner of pieces of string. Violet now became important in the episode, and took[Pg 187] charge of the wrapping; her mien showed a conviction that she could make up a parcel as well as her husband. \"Hospitals are getting in a bad way,\" said Dr. Raste, and Mr. Earlforward thought to himself that the doctor was one of those distressing persons who from nervousness could not endure a silence. \"Yes?\" \"Yes. Haven\u0027t you read about it in the papers?\" \"Well, I may have seen something about it,\" said Mr. Earlforward. But he had not seen anything about it, nor did he care anything about it. He held the common view that hospitals were maintained by magic, or if not by magic, then by the cheques of millionaires in great houses in the West End who paid subscriptions as they paid their rates and taxes. \"Yes. The London Hospital—our largest hospital—unparalleled work in the East End, you know—the London\u0027s thinking of closing a hundred beds. A calamity, but there seems to be no alternative. My wife\u0027s interesting herself in Lord Knutsford\u0027s special effort to save the beds; she used to be on the staff. I was just wondering whether you\u0027d care to give me something for her list. ... I thought I might mention it—as I\u0027m not here professionally. Here as a customer, you see.\" He gave one of his little, nervous laughs. Mr. Earlforward perceived that the doctor had not been merely breaking a silence. He perceived also that Violet, mysteriously excited by the name of the legendary subscription-collecting peer who directed the London Hospital, was \"willing\" him to practise charity on this occasion. He keenly regretted, as the doctor developed his subject, that he had left the price of the Shakspere on the desk. There it lay, waiting to be given, asking to be given! There it lay and could not be ignored. The doctor was, of course, being impudent again; but there the money lay. Half a crown? Too little. Two half-crowns, those bright and lovely objects? Too little—or at any rate too little so long as the notes lay beside them. A note? Impossible! Fantastic! The situation was[Pg 188] desperate, and Mr. Earlforward in agony. He could not in decency refuse—he a Londoner, fond of London and its institutions—he an established tradesman; neither could he part with his money. He was about to martyrize himself; his hand, each finger separately suffering, hovered over one of the notes, when deliverance occurred to him. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do,\" said he, and picked up a thin, tattered, quarto volume that was lying on the desk. \"I\u0027ll make you a sporting offer. Here\u0027s one of the earliest collected editions of Gray\u0027s Poems.\" \"Gray? Gray?\" reflected the doctor, and aloud: \"Elegy in a Country Churchyard sort of thing?\" \"Yes. This is the Glasgow edition, and I can\u0027t remember now whether it or the London edition was the first—the first collected edition, I mean. They are both dated 1768. I\u0027ll give you this for your hospital. You take it to Sotherans or Bain, and see what it\u0027ll fetch.\" The doctor opened the book. \"\u0027Full many a flower is born to blush unseen And waste its sweetness on the desart air.\u0027\" he read. \"Funny way of spelling \u0027desert,\u0027 a, r, t. But this is very interesting. \u0027Full many a flower——\u0027 So that\u0027s Gray, is it? Very interesting.\" He was quite uplifted by the sight of familiar words in an old book. \"It\u0027s very clean inside. Suppose it\u0027s worth a lot of money. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re very generous, very generous indeed.\" Violet paused in making up the second parcel. \"Well,\" said Mr. Earlforward, uplifted in his turn by reason of the epithet \"generous\" applied to him. \"I don\u0027t know without inquiring just what it is worth. That\u0027s the sporting offer.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t mind giving a couple of pounds for it myself. I should like it. \"\u0027Far from the madding crowd——,\u0027 \"Well, well! And one of the earlier editions, you say?\"[Pg 189] \"Not earliest of the Elegy. Earliest of the collected poems.\" \"Just so! Just so! Two pounds a fair price?\" \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s worth more than that, at the worst,\" said Mr. Earlforward, suddenly grieved. He saw to what an extent he was making a fool of himself—losing pounds in order to save a ten-shilling note! Ridiculous! Idiotic! Mad! True, he had bought the book for ten shillings, and he strove to regard the transaction from the angle of his own disbursement. But he could not deny that he was losing pounds. Yes, pounds and pounds. Still, he could not have let the ten-shilling note go. A ten-shilling note was a treasure, whereas a book was only a book. Illogical, but instinct was more powerful than logic. \"Ah!\" said the doctor. \"If it\u0027s worth more than two pounds I must sell it. You\u0027re generous. Mr. Earlforward, you\u0027re generous. Thank you.\" Violet rearranged the second parcel, including the Gray in it, while Dr. Raste expanded further in gratitude. \"That type won\u0027t strain anybody\u0027s eyes,\" Mr. Earlforward commented on the Gray as it disappeared within brown paper. \"No.\" \"I\u0027m thankful to say my eyesight doesn\u0027t give me any trouble now.\" \"Um!\" said the doctor, gazing at the bookseller, and taking the chance to feel his way towards the matter which had brought him into the shop. \"I shouldn\u0027t say you were looking quite the man you were when I saw you last.\" \"No, he is not!\" Violet put in eagerly. \"Oh! I\u0027m all right,\" Mr. Earlforward, defending himself against yet another example of the doctor\u0027s impudence. \"All I want is more exercise, and I can\u0027t get that because of my knee, you know.\" \"Yes,\" said the doctor. \"I\u0027ve always noticed you limp. You ought to go to Barker. I shouldn\u0027t be surprised if he could put you right in ten minutes. Not a[Pg 190] qualified man, of course; but wonderful cures!... You might never limp again.\" \"But he charges very heavy, doesn\u0027t he? I\u0027ve heard of fifty pounds.\" \"I don\u0027t know. Supposing he does? Well worth it, isn\u0027t it, to be cured? What\u0027s money?\" Mr. Earlforward made no reply to this silly question. Fifty pounds, or anything like it, for just pulling your knee about! \"What was money,\" indeed! He seized the money on the table. The doctor understood himself to have been definitely repulsed. Being a philosopher, he felt resigned. He had done what he could at an expense of twenty-five shillings. He lodged one of the parcels under his left arm and he took the other in his left hand and assumed a demeanour, compulsory in a gentleman, to indicate to the world that the parcels were entirely without weight, and that he was carrying them out of caprice and not from necessity. \"Here, doctor,\" Violet most unexpectedly exclaimed. \"As you are here I think I\u0027ll consult you.\" \"Not about me! Not about me!\" Mr. Earlforward protested plaintively, imploringly, and yet implacably. Violet leaned over him with an endearment. \"No, darling, not about you,\" she cooed. \"About myself.\" \"I didn\u0027t know there was anything particular wrong with you.\" \"Didn\u0027t you?\" said Violet in a strange tone at once dry and affectionate. \"Elsie did. Will you come upstairs, doctor?\" She was no longer the packer of books. She had initiative, authority, dominion. Horribly suspecting her duplicity, Henry watched her leave the office in front of the doctor, who had set down his parcels. Never, never, would he have a doctor! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2798/77420.html","bookId":1285,"book":{"id":1285,"title":"Riceyman Steps","description":"简介： On an autumn afternoon of 1919 a hatless man with a slight limp might have been observed ascending the gentle, broad acclivity of Riceyman Steps, which lead from King\u0027s Cross Road up to Riceyman Square, in the great metropolitan industrial district o...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2798","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM"}}
