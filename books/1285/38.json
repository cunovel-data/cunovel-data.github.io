{"id":20874,"no":38,"title":"II THE REFUSAL","content":"In the early dusk of the afternoon, about four o\u0027clock, there was a banging on the shop-door, and the short bark of a dog, who evidently considered himself entitled to help in whatever affair was afoot. Elsie was upstairs. During the morning several persons, incapable of understanding that when a shop is shut it is shut, had banged on the door, and at last Elsie, by means of two tin tacks, had affixed to the door—without a word to her master—a dirty old card on which she had scrawled in large pencilled letters the succinct announcement, \"Closed.\" This had put an end to banging. But now more banging! \"The doctor!\" Elsie exclaimed, and ran down. Not the doctor, but a lanky and elegant little girl accompanied by a fox-terrier, stood at the door. As soon as the door opened and she saw Elsie the little girl blushed. The fact was that this was her very first entry into the world of affairs, and she felt both extremely nervous and extremely anxious not to show her nervousness to a servant. The dog, of course, suffered. \"Be quiet, sir!\" she said very emphatically to the restless creature, addressing him as a gentleman, and the next minute catching him a clout on his hard head. \"Papa can\u0027t come, and he told me to say——\" \"Will you please step inside, Miss Raste?\" Elsie suggested. Nobody was about, but Elsie with a servant\u0027s imitativeness had acquired her mistress\u0027s passion for keeping private business private. The little girl, reassured by the respectful formality of her reception, stepped inside with[Pg 241] some dignity, and the dog, too tardily following, got himself nipped in the closing door and yelped. \"Serves you right!\" said Miss Raste; and to apologetic Elsie: \"Oh, not at all! It\u0027s all his own fault.... Papa says he\u0027s so busy he can\u0027t come himself, but you are to get Mr. Earlforward ready to go to the hospital, and wrap him up well; and while you\u0027re doing that I am to walk towards King\u0027s Cross and get a taxi for you. I may have to go all the way to King\u0027s Cross,\" Miss Raste added proudly and eagerly. \"But it will be all right. I got a taxi for papa yesterday; it was driving towards our Square, but I stopped it and got in, and told the chauffeur to drive me to our house—not very far, of course. Papa said I should be quite all right, and he\u0027s teaching me to be self-reliant and all that.\" Miss Raste gave a little snigger. \"Jack! You naughty boy!\" Jack was examining in detail the correspondence which Elsie had neglected and told lies about. At his mistress\u0027s protest he ran off into the obscure hinterland of the shop to stake out a claim there. \"And after I\u0027ve got you the taxi I am to walk home. Oh, and papa said I was to say you were to tell Mr. Earlforward that Mrs. Earlforward will have an operation to-morrow morning.\" Miss Raste was encouraged to be entirely confidential, to withhold nothing even about herself, by the confidence-inspiring and kindly aspect of Elsie\u0027s face. She thought almost ecstatically to herself: \"How nice it would be to have her for a servant! She\u0027s heaps nicer than Clara.\" But she had some doubt about the correctness of Elsie\u0027s style in aprons. \"Oh dear! Oh dear!\" Elsie murmured. \"And they\u0027ll be expecting Mr. Earlforward at Bart\u0027s. It\u0027s all arranged.\" Having impinged momentarily upon a drab tragedy of Clerkenwell and taken a considerable fancy to Elsie, and having imperiously summoned her dog, Miss Raste, who was being educated to leave Clerkenwell one day and dis[Pg 242]dain it, departed on her mission with a demeanour in which the princess and the filly were mingled. \"What\u0027s the matter? What have you turned the light on for?\" Mr. Earlforward demanded when Elsie, much agitated, entered the bedroom. \"What is the matter?\" Elsie tried to compose her face. \"How do you feel now, sir?\" she asked, serpent-like in spite of her simplicity and nervousness. \"I feel decidedly better. In fact, I was almost thinking of getting up.\" \"Oh! That\u0027s good. Because the doctor\u0027s sending a taxi for you, and I am to take you to the hospital at once. Here\u0027s all your things.\" She fingered a loaded chair. \"And while you\u0027re putting \u0027em on I\u0027ll just run upstairs and get my things.\" \"Is the doctor here?\" Henry cautiously inquired. \"No, sir. He says he\u0027s too busy. But he\u0027s sent his little girl.\" \"Well, I\u0027m not going to the hospital. Why should I go to the hospital?\" Mr. Earlforward exclaimed with peevish, rather shrill obstinacy. She had \"known\" he would refuse to go to the hospital. She was beaten from the start. \"But you said you would go to the hospital, sir.\" \"When did I say I would go to the hospital?\" \"You said so to missis, sir.\" \"And who told you?\" \"Missis, sir.\" \"Yes, but I didn\u0027t know then that your mistress would have to go. The place can\u0027t be left without both of us. You aren\u0027t expecting I should leave this place in your charge. Besides, I\u0027m not really ill. Hospital! I never heard of such a thing. I should like to know what I\u0027ve got—to be packed off to a hospital! I should feel a perfect fool there. I\u0027m not going. And you can tell everybody I\u0027m not going.\" He rolled over and hid his face from Elsie, and kept on muttering, feeble-fierce. He had no weapon of defence except his irrational obstinacy; but it was sufficient, and he knew it was sufficient, against[Pg 243] the entire organized world. If he had had an infectious disease the authorities would have had the right to carry him off by force; but he had no infectious disease, and therefore was impregnable. \"Now, it\u0027s no use you standing there, Elsie. I\u0027m not going. You think because I\u0027m ill you can do what you like, do you? I\u0027ll show you!\" Elsie could see the perspiration on his brow. He looked desperate. He was a child, a sick man, a spoilt darling, a martyr to anguish and pain, a tiger hunted and turning ferociously on his pursuers. His mind as much as his body was poisoned. Elsie said quietly: \"Missis is to have an operation to-morrow morning, sir.\" A silence. Then, savagely: \"Is she? Then more fool her!\" Elsie extinguished the light, shut the door and descended the stairs, wondering what brilliant people, clever people, people of resource and brains, would have done in her place. When Miss Raste came back with the taxi in the gathering night, having accomplished a marvellous Odyssey and pretending grandly that what she had done was nothing at all, it was Elsie who blushed in confusion. \"I can\u0027t get him to go to the hospital, Miss Raste. No, I can\u0027t!\" \"Oh!\" observed Miss Raste uncertainly. \"Well, shall I tell papa that?\" \"Yes, please.... Do what I will!\" \"I\u0027m afraid the taxi will have to be paid. I\u0027ve left Jack in it. He\u0027s so naughty. A shilling I saw on the dial. But, of course, there\u0027s the tip.\" Elsie hurried upstairs to her own room and brought down one and twopence of her own money. Another minute and she had locked herself up alone once again with her master.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2798/77429.html","bookId":1285,"book":{"id":1285,"title":"Riceyman Steps","description":"简介： On an autumn afternoon of 1919 a hatless man with a slight limp might have been observed ascending the gentle, broad acclivity of Riceyman Steps, which lead from King\u0027s Cross Road up to Riceyman Square, in the great metropolitan industrial district o...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2798","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM"}}
