{"id":1243,"no":5,"title":"EASTSIDER ADRIEN ARPEL","content":"EASTSIDER ADRIEN ARPEL \\n\\n America\u0027s best-selling beauty author \\n\\n \\n\\n 3-29-80 \\n\\n \\n\\n As a young girl in Englewood, New Jersey, Adrien Arpel was determined that one day she would transform herself into a beautiful woman. After having her nose bobbed, she began to pester the ladies behind every cosmetic counter she could reach, and by the time she graduated from high school at 17, she knew more than they did. That same year she opened a small cosmetics shop in her hometown with $400 earned from baby-sitting. Today, at 38, she is the president of a $12 million-a-year company selling more than 100 beauty products throughout the U.S. and Europe. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not content with mere business success, she recently turned her talent to writing her first book, Adrien Arpel\u0027s Three-Week Crash Makeover/Shapeover Beauty Program (1977). It was on the New York Times\u0027 best-seller list for six months, and is still selling briskly in paperback. Miss Arpel received $275,000 from Pocket Books for the reprint rights — the most ever for a beauty book. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have always been a rebel,\" she proclaims regally, dressed in a stylish Edwardian outfit with padded shoulders at her midtown office. Quite heavily made up, with hot pink lipstick and a Cleopatra hairdo, she looks considerably younger than her age. The strident quality of her voice is reminiscent of a Broadway chorus girl\u0027s, yet is delivered in a crisp, businesslike manner. During the interview she rarely smiles or strays from the question being asked. For some reason, she declines to say much about her new book, How to Look 10 Years Younger, which is scheduled for publication in April. Instead, she stresses the simple, common-sense rules about beauty that have guided her career from the beginning. \\n\\n \\n\\n Probably her two most important innovations are her exclusive use of nature-based, chemical-free products (chosen from leading European health spas) and her policy of try-before-you-buy makeup. Complimentary makeup is offered every time a customer gets a facial at one of the hundreds of Adrien Arpel salons, such as those on the first floor of Bloomingdale\u0027s and Saks Fifth Avenue. \\n\\n \\n\\n Whenever she opens a new salon, Adrien spends the entire day on her feet, doing upwards of 35 facials with her own pale, delicate hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon being complimented for her attire, Miss Arpel gasps, \"Thank you!\" with schoolgirlish delight. There is something almost surreal in her creamy white complexion. \"I think sunbathing is absolutely deadly, and that there is no reason in the world for a woman to sunbathe,\" she says. Moments later, she admits that \"high heel shoes are not very good for you,\" but that she wears them anyway, \"because they\u0027re very fashionable. They are something that really can be a problem — if they\u0027re pitched wrong. If you have a good shoe and it\u0027s pitched well, you shouldn\u0027t have a problem\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Does she think it would be a good idea for women to give up high heels altogether? \"No, no. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll ever get women to give up fashion. So we can tell what\u0027s problems, what\u0027s really hazardous, what\u0027s going to be injurious to your health, and what\u0027s going to just hurt a little bit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She never thought of writing a book until about four years ago, says Arpel, because \"every second when I was away from my business, I spent with my daughter. Now my daughter\u0027s 16 and a half, and has a boyfriend, and goes out, and doesn\u0027t want to spend every minute with me. This all started when she was about 13.\" Adrien and her husband, manufacturer Ronald Newman, moved to the New York metropolitan area right after they were married in 1961, and acquired an Upper East Side apartment last summer. \\n\\n \\n\\n For her own health and beauty regimen, Adrien begins her typical day with jumping rope. She thinks weight training for women is \"terrific,\" but considers jogging the best all-around exercise. \"Now, jogging has its negatives. I get up very early in the morning, and if you jog while it\u0027s still dark out, it can be dangerous. I also have long hair, and you have to wash your hair after you jog. So for someone that works, I find that I can only do it three days a week.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She has a facial twice weekly. \"Facials are not luxuries. They are necessities to peel off dead surface skin. … Air pollution is the reason. If it wears away stone on buildings, think what it can do to the skin.\" A facial, she explains, consists of \"all different sorts of hand massages to deep-cleanse the skin with coconut-like milk, or some sort of sea kelp cleanser. Then there\u0027s a skin vacuum which takes blackheads out — electric brushes with honey and almond scrubs which clean out the pores. And at the end, a mask. Nature-based again — orange jelly, sea mud, or spearmint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arpel believes that a woman\u0027s makeup should be largely determined by her profession. She reveals a humorous side when asked whether a woman stockbroker, for example, should always dress conservatively. \"Well, if she was wearing a see-through blouse and no bra in her office, I\u0027d certainly think she had poor taste,\" she laughs. \\n\\n \\n\\n A nonsmoker who consumes little alcohol, she confesses to at least one vice: \"I drink two cups of coffee in the morning, sometimes more. Also not wonderfully good for you — but I never said I was a hundred percent good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44896.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
