{"id":1279,"no":41,"title":"WESTSIDER LENORE KASDORF","content":"WESTSIDER LENORE KASDORF Star of The Guiding Light 1-20-79 For the pat few months at least, the hottest soap opera on television has been CBS\u0027 The Guiding Light, which reaches approximately 10 million viewers nationwide. The show has 22 regular characters, and right now the one who is getting the most attention is Rita Stapleton, a beautiful but deceitful nurse who recently brought up the ratings for the week when she was raped by her ex-lover on the night before her engagement to another man. It was all in a day\u0027s work for Westsider Lenore Kasdorf, who portrays the popular villainess. \"This is definitely a job, and you get the feeling of a schedule, of punching in and punching out, of rolling it off the presses. But you put in your creative element too,\" says Miss Kasdorf, taking a break between scenes at the studio. With her soft hazel eyes, pearly teeth, finely chiseled features, and billowing brown hair, she is nothing short of stunning — an impression that is heightened by her throaty voice and by the red sweater that covers her ample figure. Being the star of an hour-long \"soap\" means that Lenore often has to work from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. inside the mazelike studio, so that in winter, an entire week may go by when she doesn\u0027t see sunlight. Although she receives a tremendous number of fan letters, Lenore does not have time to answer most of them. \"I\u0027m not a letter writer anyway,\" she explains. \"There are times when someone is so sincere that you feel you really want to respond. I have had people send me a dollar check for postage. My heart goes out sometimes; I get guilty when I read my mail. This audience is very responsive. They love to comment about the show. I get a lot of identifying mail. Some people say, \u0027You\u0027re like the sister I wish I had.\u0027 Sometimes there\u0027s strange mail. Sometimes there\u0027s lewd mail, which is removed before I can read it.\" She laughs vigorously. \"That\u0027s fine with me, because then I can enjoy all my mail.\" Asked about which part of the Upper West Side she lives in, Lenore declines to say. \"I have some fans who would follow my footprints in the snow. You have to be careful. My husband and I tend to stay in the neighborhood a lot, and I\u0027d hate to ruin our indiscreet little way of getting around. … In New York people are used to seeing Al Pacino walking down the street, or Jackie O. shopping at the corner. But out of town — at first they\u0027re not sure if it\u0027s you. A lot of people come up to me and say, \u0027Do you ever watch The Guiding Light? You look so much like that girl.\u0027 I usually tell them who I am. I can\u0027t see any point in lying. Face it, that\u0027s part of the reason we\u0027re doing this. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a ham in every actor, whether they\u0027re shy about it or not.\" Her husband, actor Phil Peters, recently won the part of Dr. Steven Farrell on As The World Turns, another CBS soap opera. Within a few weeks, however, there was a change of writers. \"The new writers wanted to bring in their own characters,\" says Lenore, \"so on the show, Phil just disappeared in the night. He never showed up for his wedding. All the other characters were saying, \u0027Where could he be?\u0027\" She laughs at the recollection of what happened soon afterward when she and her husband were visiting Fredericksburg, Virginia: \"A woman came up behind Phil while we were eating dinner, and said, \u0027Shame on you! How could you run off on that pretty little thing?\u0027\" Born 30 years ago on Long Island, the daughter of an Army officer, Lenore grew up in such diverse places as Tennessee, Indiana, Virginia, Germany and Thailand. After graduating from the International School in Bangkok, she \"got out of the Army\" and returned to the U.S. to attend college in Indiana. There she began to do local TV commercials, and was so successful that she decided to try her luck in California. Quickly she became an established television actress, winning roles in many prime time series, including Starsky and Hutch, Barnaby Jones, and Ironside. While performing for a small theatre company she met Phil Peters. Phil wanted to come to New York to work in the theatre, and, with some reservations, Lenore came with him. Although Phil does not have a regular acting assignment at present, Lenore points out that \"actors are never out of work. They\u0027re just between jobs.\" The Guiding Light, says Lenore, \"was originally a religious program on the radio, where the moral of the story was an enlightening lesson for everybody.\" Since moving to television in 1952, the show has changed considerably in content, but, according to Lenore, it still contains many lessons that are relevant to modern living. \"You can tell from mail that you do help people, whether you mean to or not,\" says the actress with obvious satisfaction. \"I\u0027ve gotten letters saying, \u0027Seeing Rita through that difficulty has enlightened me about my own situation.\u0027 She has not helped by example, because Rita doesn\u0027t always do things right. But she shows how much trouble you can get into by behaving the way she does, and in that way I think she helps people avoid the same mistakes.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44932.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
