{"id":1284,"no":46,"title":"WESTSIDER RUTH LAREDO","content":"WESTSIDER RUTH LAREDO Leading American pianist 12-30-78 She has frequently been called America\u0027s greatest female pianist — a title which, as recently as the 1960s, almost any woman would have coveted. But when the year is 1978 and the musician is Ruth Laredo, this \"compliment\" brings a different response. \"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Miss Laredo, sitting back on the couch of her West Side living room. \"I would really rather be known as an American pianist. Being female doesn\u0027t preclude playing some of the most powerful sounds on the piano.\" Her words are backed by accomplishments. In October, Ruth came to the end of a four-year project to record the complete works for solo piano by Sergei Rachmaninoff, the late Russian-born composer who emigrated to the U.S. after the Revolution of 1917. Almost all of his piano works were composed before 1910, and they rank among the most technically difficult pieces ever written for the instrument. Laredo is the first person in history to record the piano solos in their entirety. Columbia Records will release the final three discs of the seven-album set in early 1979. Slender, graceful, and radiantly attractive, Laredo is still adjusting to her recently acquired status as a major international artist. For 14 years she was married to the acclaimed Bolivian-born violinist, Jaime Laredo, and during most of that time she was known primarily as his accompanist. Shortly after their marriage broke up in 1974, her career began to soar. That year the first of her Rachmaninoff recordings was made, and it won rave reviews. Her Lincoln Center debut with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in December 1974 caused such a sensation that she was quickly signed up to perform with the Boston, Philadelphia, National Symphony, Cleveland, and Detroit orchestras. \"After 15 years,\" recalls Ruth, \"I was an overnight success.\" Now, at 41 — but looking considerably younger — she can look back on four years of unbroken triumph. Following a recital at Alice Tully Hall in 1976, the New York Times reported that she \"operated within a relatively narrow range — from first-rate to superb.\" Her talents have been constantly in demand ever since across the U.S. and Canada. During the 1976-77 season she had over 40 concerts, including tours of Europe and Japan. This season she will perform in Japan and Hong Kong. Although her repertoire includes piano works spanning the last 250 years, Ruth has concentrated largely on Rachmaninoff and Scriabin, a Russian composer of the same era. She has recorded five albums of Scriabin\u0027s piano solos. \"It\u0027s such strange music if you haven\u0027t heard it before,\" she says. \"I gave some concerts of Scriabin at Hunter College, and talked about each piece before playing it. I was kind of a crusader at the time for his music. It was very rewarding for me. I think people are much more familiar with Scriabin today than they were 10 years ago. \"One thing I love to do is to talk to the audience after a concert. There\u0027s a certain feeling of distance sometimes between the audience and classical musicians, which need not happen.\" On most days, Ruth practices at one of her twin grand pianos from about 10:30 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon, when her 9-year-old daughter Jennifer gets home from school. The walls of the Laredos\u0027 living room are covered with neatly framed fingerpaintings that Jennifer created. \"She\u0027s intellectually brilliant and lots of fun. I take her to concerts with me when it\u0027s possible. When I gave a talk on Rachmaninoff to the cadets at West Point, they all called her \u0027ma\u0027am.\u0027\" A native of Detroit, Ruth began studying piano at the age of 2, performed with the Detroit Symphony at 11, and entered the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia at 16. There she met her future husband. During their years together, Ruth longed for a solo career, but it somehow eluded her. \"I played with Leopold Stokowski and the American Symphony in the 1960s,\" she says. \"There was a major concert I did at Carnegie Hall then, but nobody heard about it. I think that women are being accepted on their own merits today. They weren\u0027t given a chance until recently.\" Ruth keeps fit by riding her bicycle almost every day. She is a fan of the New York Yankees — \"I saw all the World Series games\" — and likes to do photography when she has the time. A Westsider ever since she moved to New York in 1960, Ruth lists Fiorello\u0027s (on Broadway across from Lincoln Center) as her favorite restaurant. When she needs music supplies of any kind, she goes to Patelson\u0027s (56th Street and 7th Avenue). Says Ruth: \"It\u0027s a gathering place for musicians. The people who sell music there are very friendly and very knowledgeable. … They sell records there. They sell my records.\" Asked whether men might have an inborn advantage at the piano, Ruth denies the suggestion vigorously. \"Of course not,\" she replies. \"I can\u0027t imagine why a man should play the piano better than a woman. At West Point, the women do everything the same as the male cadets except boxing and wrestling. Women might have smaller fingers on the average, but as far as strength, speed, and dexterity are concerned, it\u0027s impossible to listen to a recording and guess whether it was played by a man or a woman.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44937.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
