{"id":1296,"no":58,"title":"WESTSIDER CARLOS MONTOYA","content":"WESTSIDER CARLOS MONTOYA \n Master of the flamenco guitar \n \n 10-28-78 \n \n Carlos Montoya speaks two languages. The first is music; the other is Spanish. At 74, he is the world\u0027s most famous master of flamenco — the ancient folk music of the Spanish gypsies, which Montoya performs with dazzling speed and dexterity. On October 29 he will give a major concert at Avery Fisher Hall. \n \n With more than 30 albums to his credit, Montoya is the most recorded flamenco guitarist in history. He is thoroughly committed to his instrument. It is not merely his living, but his life. He is a pure gypsy — \"on all four sides,\" as the Spanish say. Maybe that explains why he likes to tour from January to May and from October to December every year, almost nonstop, across the U.S. and Canada, to South America, Europe and the Far East. He has been a Westsider since the 1940s and has rented the same Westside apartment since 1957. Yet when people ask Montoya where he lives, he is likely to reply, \"On airplanes.\" \n \n An American citizen for more than 30 years, he is perhaps the first persons ever to acquire citizenship after answering \"no\" to the question, \"Do you like the American form of government?\" Because of his poor English, he had misunderstood the query. He corrected himself, and that night played for President Harry Truman. \n \n Montoya\u0027s wife, Sally, is his steady helpmate. Since their marriage in 1940, she has been his manager, interpreter and best friend. He still speaks little English, so interviews with him are often ponderous three way affairs. When I arrived at the Montoyas\u0027 residence late one morning, he was very polite, but eager to get the interview over with. \"Vamos,\" he said. His demeanor changed when he discovered that I was able to understand his crisp, precise Spanish when spoken slowly. We quickly dispensed with the interpreter. \n \n Does he consider flamenco to be the highest art attainable on the guitar? Sitting upright in an overstuffed chair, he smiled benignly and said, \"Not all the flamenco guitarists are artists. There are many guitarists, but in the world there are only two or three artists on the flamenco guitar. … Most musicians are technicians. I think that to play flamenco as it should be played, you have to be an artist. The music is either very bad or very good. People who hear the performance may applaud both the technician and the artist. But afterward, if the performer was not an artist, they forget what they have heard.\" \n \n The smile remained on his face, and he began to use his hands with much expression as he continued. \"I carry the music inside me. I want to touch inside the heart of the public. That\u0027s what I always aim for. My music is sincere. It is very human. I believe it should be listened to closely. That is why I play concerts.\" \n \n He was, in fact, the first prominent flamenco guitarist to go solo. Until Montoya started giving one-man concerts in 1948, flamenco was strictly a music to accompany singers or dancers, who added to the rhythm with castanets, snapping fingers and feverishly clicking heels. When faced with Montoya\u0027s guitar alone, the audiences did not catch on immediately. But as soon as they learned to appreciate the full range of his artistry, his career was assured. \n \n Many of the sound effects produced by a whole flamenco group can be duplicated by Montoya alone. His left hand can play a melody and tap out a rhythm independent of what the right hand is going. To add to the excitement, Montoya never plays a piece the same way twice. One reason is that improvisation is the essence of flamenco. Another is that he has never learned to read music. \n \n \"Flamenco guitar is more popular than ever right now,\" said Montoya. \"Young people like it; I perform at a lot of colleges. I also perform with many symphony orchestras to play my Flamenco Suite. \n \n That composition, which Montoya co-wrote and premiered in 1996, is the first flamenco piece ever to be written for a full orchestra. The guitar sections, appropriately, allow for some improvising. Other works by Montoya, mainly his arrangements of age-old gypsy themes, have been transcribed and published for the benefit of fellow guitarists. However, as Montoya pointed out, \"the style you can write. But all the notes — it is impossible. So, my written works are simplified.\" \n \n Born in Madrid, he took his first guitar lesson at the age of 8, and by his early teens was performing regularly in cafes. He toured extensively until World War II broke out, when he more or less \"settled\" in New York. In truth, he has never been content to settle anywhere. He spends several months each year in Spain. And when he\u0027s on tour, said his wife, \"he gets restless staying around the hotel, and likes to visit all the sights in the area.\" \n \n Sally Montoya, a slender, graceful native New Yorker who met Carlos while her father was working for the Foreign Service, was once a Spanish-style dancer herself, but gave it up because \"I obviously didn\u0027t dance as well as Carlos plays. I\u0027m a casualty of his success.\" The couple has two sons. \n \n Except for travel, Carlos Montoya has few interests outside his work. \"Music and family — that\u0027s all,\" he said quietly. \"To be an artist, you must be a slave to the instrument and to the public. To play the guitar is a serious thing — not a game. To me, it is a complete life.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44983.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
