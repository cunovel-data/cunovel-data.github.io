{"id":1326,"no":88,"title":"EASTSIDER LIZ SMITH","content":"EASTSIDER LIZ SMITH Queen of gossip 3-8-80 Like most of the kids she grew up with in Fort Worth, Texas during the Great Depression, Liz Smith was star-struck by the movies. \"They told me there was a whole world out there where people were glamorous, where men and women drank wine with dinner and wore white tie and tails and drove cars with the tops down and danced on glass floors,\" she recalls, smiling dreamily. Her soft, languid accent, dripping with Southern charm, echoes through the coffee shop at the NBC building in midtown. Despite her cordiality, she somehow gives the impression of being in a great hurry. And for good reason: Smith is probably the hardest-working — and certainly the most successful — gossip writer on the East Coast. Unlike Rona Barrett, the queen of Hollywood gossip, Liz Smith does not have a large staff, but relies on a single full-time assistant and part-time \"leg man\" in California. Nevertheless, she manages to turn out, each week, six columns for the New York Daily News (syndicated nationally to more than 60 newspapers), five radio spots for NBC, and two television spots for WNBC\u0027s Newscenter 4. \"The minute I get up, I go to work. I get up at about nine, and go right to work,\" says Liz. \"I look at the paper right quick, and go right to the typewriter, and work till I finish the column at one. I work in my apartment because I would never have time to get up and dress and go to another place. I would never get to meet my deadline. … I work all the time. I work a lot on the weekends because that\u0027s the only time I can even vaguely make a stab at catching up. … I just about kill myself to get everything done. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s worth it.\" For all her complaints, Liz believes that gossip-writing is well suited for her personality. \"I can\u0027t help it. I\u0027m just one of those people who likes to repeat a tale,\" she explains. \"I\u0027d be reading every newspaper in America that I could get my hands on and every book and magazine anyway, even if I weren\u0027t doing this job.\" When she was hired by the Daily News in February, 1976 to start her column, Liz was no stranger to the New York celebrity scene; she had already been in the city for 26 years, working mainly as a free-lance writer. \"I made a lot of money free-lancing. Even 15 years ago, I never made less than $25,000 a year.\" Besides writing for virtually every mass market publication in America, she spent five years ghostwriting the Cholly Knickerbocker society column in the old Journal American. Her many contacts among the famous, and the resurgence of interest in gossip, also helped persuade Daily News editor Mike O\u0027Neill that the paper could use a gossip column in which the personality of the writer came through. Within weeks of her debut, Liz broke some of the sensational details of Woodward and Bernstein\u0027s The Final Days, which was about to be excerpted in Newsweek. She added the TV and radio broadcasts to her schedule in 1978, and avoids duplicating items whenever possible. Her best sources, says Liz, are other journalists. \"Because they know what stories are. I know a lot of very serious and important writers who have a lot of news and gossip and rumors and stuff that they don\u0027t have any place to put, so they\u0027re apt to give it to me. They have impulses to disseminate news; I think real reporters do feel that way.\" Liz says that, generally speaking, she prefers writers to all other people. Asked to name some favorites, she bubblingly replies: \"Norman Mailer. I just think Norman is a genius. Oh God, I love so many writers. My favorite novel recently was Peter Maas\u0027 book, Made in America. … There\u0027s Tommy Thompson, who just wrote Serpentine. Nora Ephrom, Carl Bernstein are friends of mine. Norman Mailer is a friend of mine. Oh, I could go on forever.\" An author in her own right, Liz wrote The Mother Book two years ago; it sold approximately 65,000 copies in hardcover and 200,000 in paperback. \"It kind of wrote itself,\" she says modestly of the acclaimed collection of anecdotes about mothers. Someday she would like to try fiction; at present she is working on a book that she describes as \"a history and philosophy of gossip and what it is and what it\u0027s all about.\" An Eastsider for half her life, Liz says her neighborhood \"has the lowest crime rate of any police district in New York.\" Most of the restaurants he frequents are on the Upper East Side. They include Le Plaisir, Gian Marino, Szechuan East and Elaine\u0027s. For years she saw her therapist at least once a week; now she pays him just occasional visits. \"It helped me enormously in writing. I quit having writer\u0027s block. I quit putting things off. I quit making myself miserable. I accepted my success, which was hard, because a lot of writers: they don\u0027t want to succeed. They don\u0027t think they deserve it. It\u0027s like people who don\u0027t want to be happy. \"Well, I mean you can be happy, you know, if you let yourself, and if you do your work. The most important thing in the world, I think, is to do your work. If you do your work, you\u0027ll be happy: I\u0027m almost positive about it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45033.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
