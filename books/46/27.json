{"id":1265,"no":27,"title":"WESTSIDER ARTHUR FROMMER","content":"WESTSIDER ARTHUR FROMMER \n Author of Europe on $10 a Day \n \n 10-8-78 \n \n His name rhymes with \"roamer\" and that\u0027s an accurate description of \n Westsider Arthur Frommer, author of Europe on $10 a Day. \n \n In 1957, when he wrote the first edition, Europe On $5 a Day, Arthur was a dedicated New York lawyer. But the book became so popular that he finally decided, after much agonizing, to leave his law firm and become a full-time travel writer. Every year in the past two decades, Arthur and his wife Hope have revisited the 17 European cities covered in the book; they have distilled the wisdom from thousands of letters received from readers; and they have revised and updated the famous travel book for the new edition each spring. It is still the world\u0027s best selling guide to Europe. \n \n \"This is not necessarily the glamorous occupation that some people imagine it to be,\" says Arthur, biting into a sandwich as he, Hope and their daughter Pauline invite me to join them at the dinner table at their Central Park West home. \"One of the hazards of being a travel writer is that when you\u0027re on vacation, you\u0027re always checking to see where the bargains are, or whether the restaurants are worth their reputation. I\u0027ve visited so many exotic cities of the world that for me, the best way to relax is to stay home.\" \n \n Due to a miscommunication on my part, I arrive on an evening exactly one week later than the Frommers have expected me, yet they manage such a warm welcome that I end up staying three hours. They seem to have plenty of time to talk. Still, there is a reminder throughout the evening that they lead very busy lives — the constantly ringing telephone. \n \n One reason for my lengthy visit is that it takes place on the same night as the second heavyweight championship boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Leon Spinks. Arthur and I sit on his living room couch, watching the fight live on TV with great interest, rooting for Ali and resuming our interview between the rounds. Ali, who had lost the first fight with Spinks the previous February, beats him handily this time. \n \n \"I\u0027m a workaholic,\" confesses Arthur, excusing himself while he gets up to answer another call from overseas. An energetic, detail-oriented man, Arthur once worked 12 hours a day writing legal briefs and eight hours a day on his book. Today he is the head of Arthur Frommer Enterprises, an international corporation that includes a publishing company, a charter service and four hotels — two in the Caribbean and two in Europe. \n \n Publishing remains his biggest enterprise. He publishes 30 to 40 travel guides each year, ranging in subject matter from the Far East to New York City. Europe On $10 A Day has for many years been co-authored by his wife Hope. \"While Arthur is on the streets grubbing for bargains,\" she says, \"I\u0027m in the museums.\" \n \n With her own career as an actress and director, Hope does not fly the Atlantic quite as often as her husband. Says Arthur: \"I go to Europe like other people commute to Long Island. Sometimes I go without even a change of clothes.\" \n \n Twelve-year-old Pauline Frommer made her first trip to Europe at the age of two and a half months. Bright and precocious, she seems a natural to succeed her father in the business one day. \n \n Arthur Frommer\u0027s success story began shortly after he graduated from Yale Law School in 1953. While serving in the Army in Europe, he used every weekend to travel. \"At the end of my stay in the Army,\" he recalls, \"having nothing to do, I sat down and wrote a little volume called The GI Guide to Europe. It was written strictly from memory; it had no prices or phone numbers. I went home and started practicing law. Then I got a cable saying that all 50,000 copies had sold out immediately.\" \n \n Arthur used his first summer vacation from the law firm to go back to Europe and rewrite his travel guide, for civilian readers. It became \"a monster which ate up my life.\" But he has never regretted his choice of careers. \n \n \"The book coincided with a revolution of American travel habits,\" says Arthur, not giving himself credit for being a prime force behind this revolution. \"When I was in college, it was unheard of for young people to go off to Europe. It was too far, too expensive. The students of the early 1960s became the first students in history to travel in great numbers to Europe. Many people think the country was greatly changed by this massive travel.\" \n \n Arthur and Hope moved to the West Side in 1965, just after their daughter was born. Among their favorite neighborhood businesses: DelPino Shoes, which has some of the lowest prices in the city for quality Italian footwear, and the Jean Warehouse, where Pauline buys many of her clothes. \n \n These days, while Hope is busy directing a play by Pamela O\u0027Neill, Arthur is working on several new projects. One is a course he will be teaching at the New School starting in February. Titled \"Great Cities of Western Europe,\" the course will concentrate on urban problems and their political and social solutions. \n \n But Arthur\u0027s biggest ambition these days is to expand his company\u0027s week-long chartered tour of Jerusalem into a two-week package for Jerusalem and Cairo. Such a tour, he believes, would help create a bond of understanding in the Middle East. \n \n \"It\u0027s a dream of mine,\" says Arthur, \"that we might be a force for peace sometime. It may not happen overnight, but I\u0027m sure it will come.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44918.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
