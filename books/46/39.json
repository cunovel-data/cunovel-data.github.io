{"id":1277,"no":39,"title":"WESTSIDER RAUL JULIA","content":"WESTSIDER RAUL JULIA Star of Dracula on Broadway 5-26-79 \"It\u0027s nice to be a vampire eight times a week,\" says Raul Julia, the star of Dracula at the Martin Beck Theatre. Last October he took over the role made famous by Frank Langella, and now Julia — pronounced \"Hoo lia\" by his Puerto Rican countrymen — has developed a cult following of his own, in this classic remake of the 1927 Broadway hit. Some critics have said that the sets and costumes by Edward Gorey are the centerpieces of the show, more so than any of the performers. But Raul Julia is rapidly becoming a local matinee idol, drawing fan mail by the bagful and constantly meeting crowds of autograph seekers outside the stage door. In his portrayal of Count Dracula, Raul takes on many characteristics of a bat. He hangs over the mantlepiece at strange angles and whips his dark cloak through the air like a bat\u0027s wings. When entrapped by three desperate men holding protective crosses and religious relics in front of them, he changes into a bat and flies out the window at the stroke of dawn. In the dressing room prior to a performance, without his makeup, he looks neither sinister nor magnetically attractive, but seems almost boyish. His wit is matched by his humility: Raul is aware that his name is not yet a household word. Not many people realize, for example, that his natural speaking voice has the same lilting Puerto Rican accent heard everywhere in the streets and subways of New York. When asked how he accounts for his flawless onstage pronunciation, Raul shrugs and says with a grin, \"Well, that\u0027s acting.\" Like Richard Chamberlain, who in 1970 played Hamlet with great success on the British stage, Julia is equally at home in British and American plays. He has starred in many of Joseph Papp\u0027s New York Shakespeare Festival productions, and has received three Tony nominations for his dramatic and musical roles on Broadway. He sips a glass of apricot juice while a makeup artist brushes his jet black hair straight back and starts to darken his eyes. Removing his shoes, Raul tells all sorts of little anecdotes about his life as the famous Count. \"I usually eat very little during the day. I go to sleep at about five, sometimes six. Maybe I\u0027m getting a Dracula schedule,\" he says with a laugh. \"Some people who see the show write and say they\u0027re going to keep their windows open at night. \"Dracula is a myth, although some people think there actually are vampires. Bram Stoker really created the character of Dracula, taking legends from different parts of the world, like the stories of sailors who had been stricken by bats, appearing on deck the next morning, all pale, without blood in them. \"I hear that Bela Lugosi was buried in a Dracula costume. I also hear that Boris Karloff came to the funeral home to visit him and looked down at the coffin and said, \u0027You\u0027re not kidding are you sweetie?\u0027\" Dracula the character is more than 500 years old; Julia the actor declines to give his age. \"Actors should be ageless,\" he says. \"You see, what age does, it limits you to a certain category.\" He doesn\u0027t mind telling his height, however. \"Eight foot four,\" he quips. \"No, six two.\" He was, in fact, born 30-odd years ago in San Juan. In 1964, after graduating from the university there, he was performing in a local nightclub revue, and comedian Orson Bean happened to be in the audience. Bean urged him to come to New York, and introduced him to Wynn Handman of the American Place Theatre. Although he had not studied acting formally, Raul\u0027s natural ability and his versatility soon began to pay off. Within two years he was playing lead roles for Joseph Papp. Married for the past three years to dancer/actress Merel Poloway, Raul devotes a great deal of his spare time to a charitable organization called the Hunger Project. \"The purpose of the group is to support anything that will help bring an end to hunger by 1997. Our goal is to transform the atmosphere that exists now,. That says that hunger is inevitable. All the experts and scientists agree that we have the means right now to end the starvation on the planet.\" A resident of the Upper West Side for the past 10 years, Raul has two major projects coming up — the title role of Othello for Shakespeare-in the-Park this summer and a movie called Isabel, which he will film in Puerto Rico this spring: \"I wanted to be in it because it\u0027s a totally Puerto Rican venture, and I want to encourage the beginning of a quality movie industry.\" Raul appears to be utterly at ease as he prepares to make his stage entrance in the middle of the first act of Dracula. I have time for one more question: \"Is the acting life everything you hoped it would be?\" Raul wraps the cloak around himself and heads out of the dressing room. He looks back at me and smiles. \"Yes,\" he replies. \"Now it is.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44930.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
