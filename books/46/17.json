Jack Roy, a paint salesman from Queens who did comedy in his spare time, stood before the cameras of the Ed Sullivan Show and delivered a routine that soon had the audience helpless with laughter. Whether they realized they were witnessing the birth of one of comedy\u0027s brightest stars is uncertain. But for Jack Roy — better known as Rodney Dangerfield — the long wait was over. \\n\\n \\n\\n His unique brand of humor caught on immediately. Within a year he was able to quit the paint business — \"it was a colorless job\" — and give his full time to comedy. After 10 appearances with Sullivan he went on The Tonight Show, and established such a smooth rapport with Johnny Carson that he has so far been invited back about 60 times. With Carson acting as \"straight man,\" Dangerfield tosses off a string of outrageous anecdotes that are in keeping with his image as a man who seems to have the whole world against him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The afternoon I meet Rodney Dangerfield at his spacious modern East Side apartment is like a day straight out of his monologue. Coming to the door dressed in a polka dot robe and looking quite exhausted, he apologizes by saying that he has been up since 8 in the morning — early for someone who is accustomed to working past 4 a.m. As we sit down to talk, he answers most of my questions with an unexpected seriousness. Still, the humor creeps in around the edges. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have an image to feed. Most comedians don\u0027t,\" he says with a yawn, sprawled out on the sofa like a bear prematurely woken from hibernation. \"If I see something or read something that starts me thinking, I try to turn it around, and ask myself: How can it go wrong for me now? What can happen here? For example, you\u0027re watching something on television. You see Lindbergh on the screen. Your mind is on that TV. … You get no respect at all. You see the paper flying all over the place. You say, I get no respect at all. I got arrested for littering at a ticker tape parade. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rickles has an image. Steve Martin has an image. But most don\u0027t. A lot of comedians buy their material. Others take someone else\u0027s material and steal it. We don\u0027t go into that, though.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Being a professional funny man, says Rodney, \"is a completely total sacrifice. It\u0027s like dope: you have to do it. … The curse is to be a perfectionist.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He writes at least 90 percent of his act. Whenever an original joke flashes into his mind, he drops whatever he\u0027s doing and jots it down. (\"I get no respect. On my wedding night I got arrested for having a girl in my room.\") Before a new gag can be thought worthy of The Tonight Show, it must be tested and retested before a live audience. This is no problem, for Rodney is constantly in demand all over the North American continent, not only as a nightclub performer but also as a lecturer at colleges. Last June he was invited to give the commencement address at Harvard. \"It\u0027s a strange thing,\" he remarks. \"Kids are into me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One probable reason for his appeal with the young is that Rodney has two children of his own, an 18-year-old son in college and a 14-year-old daughter who lives at home. It was mainly to lighten his travel schedule and enable him to spend more time with his children that Rodney opened his own nightclub nine years ago. Known simply as Dangerfield\u0027s, it is located on First Avenue between 61st and 62nd Streets. Dangerfield\u0027s is especially popular with out-of-town visitors. Among the celebrities who have been spotted there: Bob Hope, Johnny Carson, Joe Namath, Telly Savalas and Led Zeppelin. The entertainment usually consists of both music and comedy — Jackie Mason, singers Gene Barry and Carmen MacRae, and America\u0027s foremost political impressionist, David Frye. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the biggest attraction, of course, is Rodney himself. He will be playing the club from January 5 until February 4, seven nights a week. There is an $8 cover charge and a $7 minimum on food and/or drink. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rodney has lived on the East Side since 1969. Born as Jacob Cohen 57 years ago in Babylon, Long Island, he spent most of his boyhood and his early career in Queens. After graduating from Richmond Hill High School, he changed his legal name to Jack Roy \"because my father used \u0027Roy\u0027 in vaudeville.\" For years he worked small nightclubs for little or no pay. Then at 28 he married. \"My wife was a singer. So we decided to both quit show business and lead a normal life. That doesn\u0027t always work out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The first \"no respect\" joke he ever wrote, says Rodney, was: \"I played hide and seek. They wouldn\u0027t even look for me.\" The same basic gag has since reappeared in a thousand variations. (\"My twin brother forgot my birthday.\") \\n\\n \\n\\n Rodney now earns a substantial part of his income by making \\n\\n commercials, the best known of which are for Mobil and Miller Lite beer. \\n\\n He has cut two comedy albums and written a pair of books, I Don\u0027t Get \\n\\n No Respect and I Couldn\u0027t Stand My Wife\u0027s Cooking So I Opened a \\n\\n Restaurant. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the moment, Rodney has no plans for other books or albums. \\n\\n \"Perhaps I\u0027m not ambitious enough to pursue different things the way I \\n\\n should,\" he confesses.\"I\u0027d rather spend my free time at the health club. \\n\\n The idea in life is not to see how much money you can die with.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Copyright 2004 The Associated Pr ess. \\n\\n \\n\\n WESTSIDER JAN DE RUTH \\n\\n Partner of nudes and Time covers \\n\\n \\n\\n 9-24-77 \\n\\n \\n\\n In 1955, when Jan De Ruth\u0027s painting reached the point where he could support himself entirely by his brush and palette, he used to take singing lessons at 8 o\u0027clock in the morning to make himself get up early. Today he gets up strictly to paint, and does so with such skill and efficiency that he maintains a reputation as one of America\u0027s foremost painters of nudes, while still managing to turn out five or six commissioned portraits a month. \\n\\n \\n\\n At 55 and in the zenith of his career, De Ruth is a mellow, dignified Westsider whose lively eyes reflect the deep intellect within. His achievements in the past two decades are enormous. His works have graced nearly 70 one-man shows. His portraits of former First Lady Pat Nixon and other celebrity wives have appeared on the cover of Time magazine. He has written two widely popular books — Portrait Painting and Painting the Nude. As we relax in the workroom of his West 67th Street apartment, I begin by asking how he came to specialize in nudes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I always knew I would paint women,\" he says in a soft voice shaded with tones of his native Czechoslovakia. \"In 1948, when I came to the United States, I started to paint nudes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Is his choice of subject matter motivated by something other than art\u0027s sake?\" \"The only person I think who may have these thoughts in mind is myself,\" he answers, smiling frankly, \"because I always ask myself whether these reasons are purely artistic or do they come from the gut? I don\u0027t think there can be art unless it comes from the gut.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n De Ruth\u0027s painting used to occupy him eight to 15 hours a day. Now he is down to about seven hours. He works very rapidly, with intense concentration. \"I don\u0027t paint after the afternoon,\" he explains, \"except sometimes sketching at night. You exhaust your juices by the time evening comes along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One person he used to sketch after hours was actress Karen Black, who lived in West 68th Street just across from his apartment. Says De Ruth: \"she would sit in the in the windowsill in her bra and slip. Then one day I called over to her, \u0027Would you like to get paid for this?\u0027 She rushed inside to get her glasses, and looked over at me, very surprised. She became my model for some time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a woman to be an ideal nude model, said De Ruth, \"she should be gentle, as intelligent as possible, considerate, and somebody in the arts, or with the sensitivity of an artist. And she must be physically attractive.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n How do the women who pose fully dressed for commissioned portraits compare to the professional nude models? \"They work better than my models usually,\" says the artist, who has painted Ethel Kennedy, Eleanor McGovern, and the late Martha Mitchell for Time. \"They\u0027re much more concerned to participate. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessarily something to do with vanity. It\u0027s much more curiosity. Because we never really know until the day we die what we look like. Because we vary so much from one time to another.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ironically, Martha Mitchell — wife of President Nixon\u0027s infamous attorney general, John Mitchell — posed for De Ruth inside the Watergate Building during the height of her fame. \"She had a certain peasant charm — a charm of her own,\" he recalls. \\n\\n \\n\\n A man who craves variety, De Ruth has for many years spent his summers at a studio in Massachusetts. This past summer he began to teach painting in New Mexico — something he has wanted to try for a long time. A passionate skier, he travels to Austria each winter to pursue the sport that he learned as a child, then gave up until his mid-40s. \\n\\n \\n\\n His other after-work activities? \"I love to be in the company of women,\" says the artist with a radiant smile, adding that he prefers their company when he\u0027s not painting them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The East Side, according to the artist, is \"a city in itself. There\u0027s a sterility over there, at least for me. I just can\u0027t see myself without this mixture that the West Side is.\" De Ruth has been going to the same Chinese laundry for 28 years — Jack\u0027s on Columbus Avenue. Another business he has patronized all that time is Schneider\u0027s Art Supplies at 75th Street and Columbus. \\n\\n \\n\\n As the interview comes to a close, I ask De Ruth what advice he would give to an aspiring young artist. \"Never be discouraged by anyone or anything,\" he says. Then, to balance his remarks, he relates an anecdote about an art student who asked Degas what he could do to help the world of art. Replied Degas: \"Stop painting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44908.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
