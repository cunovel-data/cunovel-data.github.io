{"id":1320,"no":82,"title":"EASTSIDER DICK SHAWN","content":"EASTSIDER DICK SHAWN \\n\\n Veteran comic talks about Love at First Bite \\n\\n \\n\\n 5-19-79 \\n\\n \\n\\n Dick Shawn\u0027s name keeps cropping up these days. The last time he made a big splash in New York was two years ago, when his one-man show, Dick Shawn is the Second Greatest Entertainer in the Whole Wide World, played at the Promenade Theatre for 14 weeks. But last fall, he gained millions of new fans with his sparkling appearances on the ill-fated network variety show starring Mary Tyler Moore, which folded after the third week. A commonly heard criticism of the show was: less Mary and more Shawn. \\n\\n \\n\\n In George Hamilton\u0027s recently released film, Love At First Bite, Shawn plays the role of Lieutenant Ferguson, who teams up with a psychiatrist in order to make war on Dracula. Also he recently played the lead in the new Russell Baker/Cy Coleman musical, Home Again. But these are only a few of the highlights of Shawn\u0027s career, as I discover in an interview with the 51-year-old comedian at his plush Upper East Side apartment. \\n\\n \\n\\n The word \"comedian,\" he quickly points out, is not quite accurate. \"I think of myself as a comedy character,\" he explains, relaxing on his couch with a plate of croissants and bacon that his pretty assistant has just brought him. \"In Home Again, I played seven characters. … They ran out of money; it just closed out of town. It needs another four or five weeks of work. They plan to bring it back around September.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With his middle-age paunch and full head of tousled grey hair that resembles a bird\u0027s nest, Shawn has a definite comedic look about him, but he seldom smiles and never laughs during our long conversation. Still, his answers are both entertaining and revealing. \\n\\n \\n\\n On Mary Tyler Moore\u0027s variety show: \"That was a total mistake. They didn\u0027t know what they were doing there. I thought she was going to get the best writers and the best producers. But it was totally inadequate. I knew from the very first day that it wasn\u0027t going to work. … The whole concept was wrong. Variety isn\u0027t Mary\u0027s forte. You have to get yourself rolling around on the ground a little bit. She\u0027s such a nice, sweet girl that she doesn\u0027t come off as a clown.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The basis of all humor, believes Shawn, \"is hostility. But it has to be sweet hostility. … I think people become comedians because they poke fun at pretentiousness. They usually come from meager backgrounds, and then they can look up and see the pomposity and the hypocrisy of many human beings. That\u0027s why there are no rich comics. A great many of them are Jewish or black — because as a kid they were told they were part of a minority group. They learned to have a sense of humor about themselves: they had to, in order to survive. Humor is their way of getting even with mankind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shawn\u0027s own background lends credence to his theory. Born Richard Schulefand in the steel town of Lackawanna, New York, he grew up in a family that was hard-hit by the Depression. While serving with the Army following World War II, he ended up in an entertainment troupe. \"I was delighted,\" he recalls, \"and when I got out, I decided to pursue it.\" In the early 1950s, he secured his first professional engagement as a stand-up comic in Bayonne, New Jersey, and was paid $25 a night. Since then, he has never been out of work, and has constantly used only his own material for his solo act — songs as well as sketches. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really do jokes,\" he explains. \"I do situation characters. Although the thrust of my humor is serious, I have always taken chances. In my club act, for example, I always ended up pretending to die on stage, rather than taking bows. Two guys would come with a stretcher and carry me out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Among his more memorable performances over the years: the successor to Zero Mostel in Broadway\u0027s A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, the freakishly funny beach bum in the Stanley Kramer film It\u0027s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, and a cavorting Adolph Hitler in Mel Brooks\u0027 zany 1968 movie, The Producers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still, no project has gained him as much personal satisfaction as The \\n\\n Second Greatest Entertainer in the Whole Wide World. After the New \\n\\n York run, the show played to enthusiastic audiences in San Francisco and \\n\\n Los Angeles, and earned Shawn awards for both Best Performer and Best \\n\\n Playwright of the Year. \\n\\n \\n\\n An Eastsider for the past seven years, he names Elaine\u0027s as his favorite local restaurant because \"the food is good, and there\u0027s a simplicity about the place the attracts me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shawn describes himself as \"disciplined, but not as disciplined as I should be. Because my work is loose, I\u0027m always adding or changing. Nothing ever stays the same. But comedy is a very rewarding profession. It\u0027s nice to know that something that pops into your head can cause a reaction from total strangers who are paying you money to be entertained. I think that\u0027s the ultimate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Probably best-known for The Prod ucers. \\n\\n \\n\\n EASTSIDER GEORGE SHEARING \\n\\n Famed jazz pianist returns to New York \\n\\n \\n\\n 2-3-79 \\n\\n \\n\\n The scene was a Boston nightclub in the early 1950s. George Shearing and his quintet were scheduled to play the second set of the evening; the opening act was a piano/bass/drums trio. But as soon as the first group\u0027s pianist hit the keys, a groan went up from the audience. It was a bad box, as they said in those days. The management\u0027s promise of a tuning had not been kept. \\n\\n \\n\\n The trio retired in defeat 15 minutes later, and the audience called for Shearing. When the blind pianist was led on stage, he announced, to everyone\u0027s astonishment, that he would open with a solo. But when he sat down at the instruments, a small miracle took place. The notes rang out with the clarity of crystal; Shearing\u0027s acute ear had told him which keys to avoid, and the precise amount of pressure to apply to the others so that the poor tuning would be camouflaged. Those who were present to witness Shearing\u0027s uncanny musicianship may never forget the experience. But attending any of his performances is hardly less forgettable. \\n\\n \\n\\n He\u0027s now playing each Tuesday through Saturday evening at the Cafe Carlyle, 76th Street and Madison Avenue, and will remain there until March 3rd. His famous quintet is no more — the group was disbanded in 1978 after 29 years — but Shearing, accompanied only by bass player Brian Torff, proves himself a master showman as he performs his unique brand of jazz, tells funny stories between numbers, and sings in his lilting, playful manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m on the road about 10 months a year,\" he told the Carlyle crowd the previous night, when I went there to catch his show. \"And one thing I cannot tolerate is the mediocrity of hotels and motels in this country. Once, on my second morning in a hotel, I called up the room service and said, \u0027Could you please bring me some breakfast? I\u0027d like two eggs, one of them poached and the other scrambled; two pieces of toast, one barely warm and the other burned almost to a crisp; and a pot of half coffee and half tea.\u0027 The person on the other end said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry sir, I don\u0027t think we can fill that order.\u0027 I said, \u0027Why not? That\u0027s what you brought me yesterday.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The next afternoon I paid Shearing a visit at his new Eastside apartment, where he recently moved from San Francisco. An extremely amiable, witty, and knowledgeable man who speaks with a soft British accent, he guided me around the large, tastefully furnished apartment with great ease, showing me his braille-marked tape collection, his audio calculator and his braille library. He described everything, from the drapes to the furniture, as if he had perfect vision. Blind since birth, he is an expert bridge player and a fine cook. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve just started to take cooking lessons,\" said Shearing, stretched out n the sofa with a smile hovering constantly on his face. \"My wife and I are taking the same course. It\u0027s at the Jewish Guild for the Blind. Naturally it\u0027s better for me to take lessons from someone who knows the idiosyncracies of cooking without looking. … I\u0027m very interested in taste. If I were to cook some peas, for example, I would be inclined to line the saucepan with lettuce and add a little sugar and mint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Born 59 years ago in London, the ninth child of a coalman, he began plucking out radio tunes on the piano at the age of 6, and by his early 20s was considered one of England\u0027s finest jazz pianists. He moved to the U.S. in 1947, and two years later became an overnight sensation when his newly formed quintet recorded \"September in the Rain,\" which sold 900,000 copies. To date, Shearing has recorded more than 50 albums. When he finally broke up his quintet, it was to allow himself more musical freedom. His playing is a combination of jazz, classical and pop that calls for much improvisation. \\n\\n \\n\\n His most famous original composition, \"Lullaby of Birdland,\" came to him \"when I was sitting in my dining room in New Jersey, eating a steak. It took me only 10 minutes to write it. I went back to that butcher several times afterwards, but I never got the same steak.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A popular television personality, Shearing has appeared on all the major TV talk shows. In the past 15 years or so, he has also become a frequent performer with symphony orchestras, usually playing a piano concerto in the first half of the program and a jazz piece in the second half. Lionized in England, he returned to London last December and played a sellout concert at the 6500-seat Royal Albert Hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n New York is where his American career began, and he decided to move back after spending 16 years on the West Coast, primarily because New York is far more centrally located for his extensive travelling. He chose the Upper East Side because \"it would be difficult to realize we\u0027re in the heart of Manhattan, it\u0027s so quiet here.\" No sooner did he speak the words than, as if on cue, a baby in a downstairs apartment began to cry loudly. \"Does somebody have a plastic bag?\" he deadpanned. \\n\\n \\n\\n One of Shearing\u0027s main interests — besides music, bridge and cooking — is business law. He once took a course on the subject \"because I wanted to know what the other guy\u0027s rights are. If I know what his rights are, I know what mine are.\" Speaking of his many disappointments in hotels and motels, he said, \"Misrepresentation and false advertising can be beaten at any time anyone wants to fight it. I have never lost a battle on this score yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He might have added, had modesty not prevented it, that he has also lost no battles in the game of life. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45027.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
