Now, with longer broadcasting hours and the abundance of new channels, vintage movies are enjoying a second life, often with a bigger audience than the first time. Maybe that\u0027s why the name Maureen O\u0027Sullivan is practically a household word even today. Between 1930 and 1965 she made dozens of films, ranging from Marx Brothers comedy (A Day At The Races) to classics of English literature (David Copperfield, Pride and Prejudice) to Tarzan films, in which she played Jane. \n \n But unlike so many of her contemporaries, Maureen is neither dead nor retired. She maintains a busy schedule of acting, writing, traveling, and enjoying her status as a mother of five and a grandmother of many. \n \n Maureen shows me around her large, beautiful apartment facing Central Park, right across the hallway from Basil Rathbone\u0027s last home. \"I keep this part for the children,\" she says, indicating a section of several rooms. There are photos of her children everywhere, including a good number of her actress daughters Mia and Tisa Farrow. Mia lives in England and Tisa is in California, but they still get together frequently. \n \n \"I\u0027m doing an autobiography now. It\u0027s about halfway done. My agent has the manuscript. But I\u0027m not writing any more until I see if there\u0027s any interest in it. … I started it two years ago, then put it away. I wasn\u0027t even interested in it myself. Then a friend of mine, John Springer, had me to lunch. He said, \u0027You ought to do an autobiography.\u0027 I said I had already started one. … So I went back and worked on it some more, and condensed it into 10 pages. I had to do it myself — every word, syllable, comma.\" \n \n She recently spent five weeks in upstate New York playing one of the leads in The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams. The critics had nothing but praise for her portrayal of the ambitious mother, and one described Maureen\u0027s acting as \"genius.\" \n \n The stage is not the only place where Maureen employs her dramatic talents. Shortly after completing the Williams play, she went to Albany, New York to do a reading from The Wayward Bus for the state legislature. \"They\u0027re trying to get a new bill through Congress to get money for a program for more halfway houses for women alcoholics,\" she explains. \"I believe in that kind of thing.\" \n \n One of the last plays she did in New York City was No Sex Please — We\u0027re British. It was a hit in London, and the preview performances were doing well enough in New York to call for an official Broadway opening. \"Then [drama critic] Clive Barnes came to the producer and said, \u0027If you have an opening you\u0027ll have a disaster, because the critics won\u0027t like it.\u0027 And he was right. As soon as the reviews came out, the theatre emptied. In the previews, the audiences loved it. The critics made a big thing out of opening night. In London, I don\u0027t think the public pays that much attention to the critics. The average person there doesn\u0027t read the reviews.\" \n \n Perhaps it\u0027s the singing lessons she has never stopped taking that account for her pure lyrical speaking voice, which is still as sweet as it was when she made her first film, Song of My Heart, nearly 50 years ago. Though Maureen\u0027s soft British accent gives no hint of it, she was brought up in Dublin, Ireland. While working as a young actress in England she was discovered by an American producer and brought to the U.S. to do her first movie with famed tenor John McCormack. After that her career blossomed. \n \n Any comment on the Tarzan films for which she became famous? \"I made five. They have been remembered. I\u0027m glad to be remembered for something. Let\u0027s leave it at that.\" \n \n These days, while Maureen is waiting to hear about her autobiography, she is working on some short stories. Two have appeared in the Ladies\u0027 Home Journal. \"I have no special goals,\" she says. \"One thing leads to another. Supposing my theatrical career came to an end, I\u0027d like to open an antique shop in Vermont, and write, and paint — I always have — and sew. If you can do one art, you can do them all. It\u0027s different ways of saying the same thing. \n \n \"I\u0027m a special type of grandmother. At the theatre, I like to take the children backstage. And in New York, I take them in a horse and buggy around the park, or for tea at the Plaza. In that way, I can bring color into their lives.\" \n \n Maureen has been a Westsider for the past 15 years. \"I\u0027m very fond of \n Mal the Tailor, on 72nd near Columbus. And Mr. Walsh the florist. \n O\u0027Neal\u0027s Balloon. The Pioneer Market. They\u0027re all on 72nd Street. That\u0027s \n my beat.\" \n \n She walks toward the window. \"I love this view. The park is different every time of the year. Now it\u0027s all covered with snow. Pretty soon the buds will be all over the trees.\" She smiles contentedly. \"I really think that if I had to leave the West Side I\u0027d leave New York. Because to me, this is New York.\" \n \n Hannah and Her Sisters. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44990.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
