{"id":1250,"no":12,"title":"EASTSIDER SAMMY CAHN","content":"EASTSIDER SAMMY CAHN \n Oscar-winning lyricist \n \n 3-10-79 \n \n \"I\u0027ve never written a song that didn\u0027t almost write itself,\" says Sammy Cahn, one of the world\u0027s most successful lyricists of popular songs. \"I\u0027m like the catalyst. It\u0027s like I start the boulder down the hill, but after that, there\u0027s only one place it can go. I\u0027m always thrilled by the adventure of finding the lyric and leading it to a happy conclusion. If I come to the slightest impasse, I\u0027ve learned to stop, and look around and see what needs to be done around the house. Then I come back, and it\u0027s so easy. You can\u0027t go into combat with a lyric.\" \n \n Over the past four decades, his songs have received four Oscars and more than 30 Oscar nominations. Among his numerous hits, written in collaboration with six different melodists, are \"Three Coins in a Fountain,\" \"Love and Marriage,\" \"Call Me Irresponsible\" and \"Let It Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!\" His musicals include Anchors Aweigh and High Button Shoes. As a performer, he has the distinction of making his Broadway debut in 1974 at the age of 60, in a one-man show with backup musicians titled Words and Music, in which he sang his own material and told colorful stories about his life and career. For his performance, Sammy won the Outer Circle Critic\u0027s Award for Best New Talent on Broadway, as well as a Theatre World Award. Since then, he has been in great demand all over the country as an entertainer. \n \n Small, wiry and energetic — he describes himself as \"all glasses and mustache\" — he is utterly without pretension, and seems as much at home with strangers on the street as he is with royalty (last year he sang for England\u0027s Prince Charles). He manages to embrace both worlds by involving himself in many projects simultaneously. \n \n Born on \"the lowest part of the Lower East Side,\" he now has an apartment in the East 60s with his wife Tita, a fashion designer. He has another residence in Los Angeles, and spends about the same number of days each year in the two homes. \n \n Recently Sammy completed the songs for a new cartoon film of Heidi and a series of songs for Sesame Street. He also works as a consultant for Faberge, and has a large office in the company\u0027s East Side headquarters. As president of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Sammy devotes much of his time to publicizing the non-profit organization\u0027s museum on the eighth floor of One Times Square. It is open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and admission is free. He recently met with the producer of the Broadway musical Annie to discuss writing a new musical. He gives generously to many charitable causes. \n \n But the majority of his time these days goes to writing and performing special lyrics for special occasions — usually parodies of his own hit songs. Sometimes he does this for profit, and sometimes for love. He was paid handsomely to prepare a birthday celebration for Ray Kroc, the head of Mcdonald\u0027s. But a couple of weeks ago, when a man wrote to Sammy telling him how much his songs had meant to him and his wife over the years, and asking him to please write some personalized lyrics for their 18th wedding anniversary, Sammy was \"just enough of an idiot to sit down and do it.\" \n \n He works exclusively at the typewriter. \"I have become almost audacious. When I put a piece of paper in the typewriter, I know that the completed song will be on that page. I\u0027m very grateful to the man who invented Correctotype and liquid paper. I start to type as soon as I get up, and I think about songs all day long. When I sleep at night, I sleep with an earplug in my ear, tuned to WCBS or WINS radio. They\u0027re both news stations. The radio distracts me: it stops me from thinking about lyrics.\" \n \n As we are talking, Sammy keeps remembering telephone calls he needs to make, but he keeps them brief and to the point. As soon as he hangs up, our conversation jumps immediately back to the previous subject, as if there had been no interruption. He is extremely quick-minded — to the extent that his thoughts sometimes race ahead of him, and his sentences lose their structure. In speaking of his son, a very successful jazz guitarist who performs under the name Steve Khan, Sammy comments: \"Now, my son — brace yourself — my son — this is one of my great, great achievements — my fame is coming from a very curious source. People come up to me and say, \u0027You\u0027re Steve Kahn\u0027s father?\u0027\" \n \n Asked about the satisfaction he has gotten from songwriting, Sammy insists that he can\u0027t imagine a more rewarding career. \"I once told that to a college audience and a boy said, \u0027I\u0027m studying to be a lawyer. What\u0027s wrong with that?\u0027 I said, \u0027Nothing, but who walks down the street humming a lawsuit?\u0027\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44903.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
