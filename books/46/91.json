Who knows, 10 years from now I may not be that way. A lot of my friends are afraid I\u0027ve gone too far too fast.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n During the first 18 years of his life, when he lived in Garden City, Long Island, John was a top student, a star athlete, and a fine musician. After graduating from high school he left for North Carolina to attend the state university on a soccer scholarship. His goal — to become a doctor. But when John returned to the New York area in 1976 at the age of 24, it was not as a professional athlete or a physician, but as a television news reporter. Today, at 27, he is one of the most highly respected young broadcasters in New York. Throughout the week he appears regularly on Channel 2\u0027s 6 o\u0027clock news as an on-the-scene reporter, and each Saturday and Sunday he co-anchors both the 6 o\u0027clock and the 11 o\u0027clock evening news. According to Tesh, his 6 o\u0027clock weekend show is watched by more people than any other local news program in New York. \\n\\n \\n\\n As if this job were not enough, last September John opened his own sporting goods store, Sports Stripes, located on Columbus Avenue at 75th Street, a few blocks from his apartment. The compact, brightly decorated store specializes in running equipment and is the only place in New York City where running shoes can be resoled on the premises. \\n\\n \\n\\n When I stop by Sports Stripes one afternoon to talk with John over lunch, the first thing I notice is his sheer size. At 6 foot and 190 pounds, he makes a commanding presence. There is command in his voice as well; it is as deep and rich as a Russian bass-baritone\u0027s. He seems extraordinarily calm, and when I comment on this, he says that \"there\u0027s not as much pressure in New York as there was then I worked in North Carolina. Here you\u0027re able to concentrate solely on your reporting. There you were concerned with logistical problems — shooting the film, developing it, editing it, selecting slides, producing the broadcast, and then anchoring it. … But I\u0027m not as calm as I might appear. I think people at Sports Stripes and CBS think of me as frenetic.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His entry into broadcasting was totally unplanned. Halfway through college, he got a part-time job as a copy boy at a local radio station. One day the station\u0027s two newsmen called in sick, and John was asked to fill in. Instantly bitten by the broadcast journalism \"bug,\" he decided to trade in his premed courses for television/radio production and political science. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When I finished college,\" says John in his low-keyed manner, \"I had the choice of going to medical school or continuing in broadcasting, so I felt l could go either way. I decided to stay in broadcasting for a while.\" After working at television stations in North Carolina, Florida and Tennessee, he was offered a job at WCBS. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I would say that most correspondents try to get to New York, because the production is a lot better here. … I wouldn\u0027t like the anchor job without the field work,\" he adds thoughtfully. \"I have been told that my forte is breaking news. Last year I won an Emmy for that. The same year I won an Emmy for outstanding reporting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Unedited, live television is what it\u0027s coming to. It\u0027s interesting, because it\u0027s come full circle. At one time, everything was live. Then for some reason it went so heavily into tape, and now it\u0027s back into live journalism. As the public becomes better informed, so changes the news. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When Fred Cowan was holed up in a warehouse in New Rochelle, and he had killed at least one police officer and was holding several hostages, I was in a house across the street from there. We were reporting as it was happening. There were shots fired; I didn\u0027t realize until afterwards how intense it was.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Asked about which skills are required for live journalism, John says: \"I think it\u0027s being able to explain quickly and concisely the situation at hand without becoming too involved in the situation. Becoming the eyes and ears of the viewer. Being able to ad-lib is actually what it is. [Walter] Cronkite is one of the great all-time ad-libbers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A bachelor who lives alone, John still finds time for sports and music: \"I get enough excitement out of the store and work so that when it\u0027s time to go home I like to be quiet. I have an electric piano, which I play with headsets. … I\u0027ve run two marathons here in New York. I\u0027m too big to be a good marathon runner, but I do train hard. My ambition is to find some race to win.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n John says he likes the West Side to much that \"my friends have to drag me to the East Side. I do all my shopping on the West Side because I figure, why shouldn\u0027t I help out my friends who live here by shopping at their stores?\" When John decided to open his own store, he called up his boyhood friend Paul Abbott to run it. The pair were classmates from grammar school through high school. \\n\\n \\n\\n John says he hopes to eventually open his own seafood restaurant — \"on the West Side, of course. This is where I plan to live for the rest of my life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45036.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
