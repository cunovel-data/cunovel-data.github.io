{"id":1281,"no":43,"title":"WESTSIDER HAROLD KENNEDY","content":"WESTSIDER HAROLD KENNEDY \\n\\n Author of No Pickle, No Performance \\n\\n \\n\\n 7-22-78 \\n\\n \\n\\n In the early days of Harold Kennedy\u0027s theatrical career, he was involved in a play written by Sinclair Lewis, who may have been a great novelist but was no playwright. Kennedy was talking with Lewis one evening before the play opened when a young student approached the famous author and politely asked for an autograph. Lewis took the piece of paper the boy offered him and wrote on it: \"Why don\u0027t you find a hobby that isn\u0027t a nuisance to other people?\" He handed it back unsigned. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the boy got even. The play opened a few nights later and was a total disaster. Lewis was sitting gloomily in the dressing room after the final curtain when a note was hand-delivered to him by an usher. He opened it and read, in his own handwriting: \"Why don\u0027t you find a hobby that isn\u0027t a nuisance to other people?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The story is one of dozens told in Harold Kennedy\u0027s book, No Pickle, No Performance, published this month by Doubleday. The book is a fascinating collection of true-life anecdotes stored up by Kennedy during his four decades in the theatre as a director, actor, and playwright on Broadway and across the country. The subtitle of his book is \"An Irreverent Theatrical Excursion from Tallulah to Travolta,\" and he has written chapters about his experiences with both of these stars, in addition to Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Thornton Wilder, Gloria Swanson, Steve Allen, and others who are less well known today but were legends in their time. \\n\\n \\n\\n Its book is dedicated to actress Renee Taylor, who refused to come on stage during a play\u0027s opening night until she got a pickle with her sandwich, as she had during the previews. The coffee shop that had provided those sandwiches was closed, and the curtain was held while a prop man got in his car and went searching for the holy pickle. It arrived seven minutes after the advertised curtain time, and the show went on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Unknown to Taylor, the stage crew was so enraged by her antics that they performed \"a little ceremony\" with the pickle before giving it to her. Gloria Swanson later said: \"Poor Miss Taylor. Can\u0027t you see her shopping around to every delicatessen in New York complaining that she can never find a pickle to match the caliber of the one she had in New Jersey.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I meet the author on a recent evening at Backstage on West 45th Street. \"The thing about this book,\" he says, \"is that whether people know the actors or not, they find the stories amusing. You know, I never thought of writing these stories down. I used to tell them to other members of the company over drinks after the show, and everyone loved them. But I\u0027m an actor, and I thought what made them funny was the way I told them. I didn\u0027t know how they\u0027d look in print. A good friend of mine finally convinced me to write about a hundred pages, and I said, \"If anyone wants it, I\u0027ll write the whole thing.\" The first publisher I sent it to — Doubleday — accepted it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Those who have seen portions of the Ginger Rogers chapter in a recent issue of New York magazine might think the book is malicious, but this is not the case. Says Kennedy: \"It just tells what happened, and some people come out better than others.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The chapter begins: \"It seems that Ginger Rogers never smiles. It may be that someone has told her it would crack her face. It may be more likely that she\u0027s a lady devoid of one smidgin of one inch of a sense of humor.\" The author describes her as \"colder than anyone else I had met. Totally unlike her screen self — which only goes to prove what a good actress she is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He reveals Rogers at her worst when she attempts to make an actor out of her no-talent fifth husband, G. William Marshall, at the expense of Kennedy and everyone else in the cast. The couple were still on their honeymoon, and Rogers demanded that Bill be given the role of her leading man in Bell, Book and Candle. The results were disastrous. Detroit\u0027s leading critic wrote after the opening: \"The program lists Mr. Marshall as having been acquainted with many phases of show business. Last night he showed not even a nodding acquaintance with any of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kennedy writes at the chapter\u0027s end: \"Hopefully Ginger will find another husband. As it turned out, the last one apparently worked out worse for her than it did for me.\" Rogers is apparently considering a lawsuit against the author. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still very active in the theatre at 64, Kennedy is undertaking three productions this summer — Barefoot In the Park with Maureen O\u0027Sullivan and Donny Most, The Marriage-Go-Round with Kitty Carlisle, and Bell, Book and Candle with Lana Turner. He is directing all three and acting in two of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two years ago he directed John Travolta for a summer stock company that opened to hordes of screaming teenagers in Skowhegan, Maine. Whenever Travolta made in entrance or an exit, Kennedy tells in the chapter titled \"John Who?\", he caused such a commotion that the play virtually came to a halt. \"John is a darling. He\u0027s such a lovely boy,\" says the author. \"He\u0027d kiss me full on the lips when we met and parted. And I say that with no sense of implication. In the theatre, we\u0027ve always been relaxed about an expression of affection. … I thought in Saturday Night Fever he was a star in the old tradition — in the tradition of Tyrone Power. … I couldn\u0027t call John intelligent, but he\u0027ll own the movie industry in two years. And he has things in his contract that no other stars have had, like approval of the final cut of the movie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A native of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Kennedy worked his way through Dartmouth College and the Yale School of Drama \"and came out with a profit.\" In 1937 he moved to New York; he has lived on the West Side ever since. Among his close friends are some of the merchants and artisans in his area. \"They care about theatre and they know we have special problems,\" he says. \"There\u0027s Mal the Tailor on West 72nd Street, for example. If I\u0027m doing a play and need something right away, he\u0027ll drop everything and take care of me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n No Pickle, No Performance has already received many favorable reviews and has been partially reprinted in the New York Post. Kennedy is planning to hit the talk shows soon with some of his leading ladies. What seems to be uppermost in his mind at the moment, however, is whether Ginger Rogers will sue for libel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I kind of wish she would, just to get some publicity for the book,\" he muses. \"Of course, she\u0027s a fool if she does, because she\u0027d never win, and the people who haven\u0027t heard of the book will rush out and get it. … But I can say one thing: if there\u0027s a package from Ginger waiting for me in my dressing room, I\u0027m going to have it dumped in water.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44934.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
