It was a fitting cap to Pel\u0027s career that his team, the Cosmos, won the North American Soccer League championship last season over 23 other teams. \\n\\n \\n\\n But while the Brazilian superstar was reaping most of the publicity, one of his teammates, Franz Beckenbauer, was quietly getting things done. It was probably he, more than anyone else, who won the title for the Cosmos — not by scoring goals, but by controlling the midfield with his pinpoint touch passes and setting up the offense to go in for the shot. \\n\\n \\n\\n In May, 1977, he shocked the sports world by quitting his West German team, Bayern Munich, and signing a $2.8 million contract to play with the Cosmos for four years. And though he missed one-third of the 1977 season, Franz still received last year\u0027s Most Valuable Player award for a league encompassing 600 players from around the world. This season again, thanks largely to his efforts, the Cosmos clinched their division title and are a heavy favorite to repeat their victory in the Soccer Bowl — the Super Bowl of soccer. This year the Soccer Bowl will be held in Giant Stadium on August 27. To be in that game, the Cosmos must first win in the playoffs, which begin on August 8. \\n\\n \\n\\n Beckenbauer is so famous in Germany that he finds it impossible to lead a private life there. His fame is well deserved: Franz starred for the West German national team in the 1966 World Cup finals and the 1970 semifinals, and captained the team when it won the World Cup in 1974. During his 12 seasons with Bayern Munich of the German Soccer League, he was named German Footballer of the Year four times and European Footballer of the Year twice, and was runner-up on two other occasions. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Franz is somewhat of a quiet, shy man, who does not like the limelight. In New York he can be himself, and walk the streets undisturbed, thinking about his wife and three children in Switzerland, who will be joining him this month for a long visit. \\n\\n \\n\\n I meet Franz on a July afternoon after a practice at Giant Stadium. As we sit talking in the locker room, many of his teammates walk by and wave to him or call his name. He is an extremely popular fellow both on and off the field — which explains why 72,000 people showed up for a game last May commemorating Franz Beckenbauer Day. With his courtly manners, he has rightfully earned the nickname \"Kaiser Franz.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He could speak almost no English when he arrived in New York less than two years ago at the age of 31, but has learned remarkably quickly. \"My mind was, soccer in the United States, it\u0027s easier to play. But it\u0027s not so easy as I expect,\" he says, in his slightly hesitant but perfectly understandable speech. \"You have so different things, like Astroturf. You have to play in the summertime. It\u0027s so hot. You have to make big trips, like to Los Angeles. Sometimes it\u0027s more difficult to play here than in Europe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When asked to compare soccer with American football, he says, \"You can\u0027t compare. It\u0027s a much different sport. As an American footballer, you must be not a normal man. You must be maybe 200 pounds, and 6 foot 3, 6 foot 4 or 5. Everybody can play soccer — big, tall, small — if he is skilled enough, if he has the brain to play. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I started when I was 3, 4, 5 years old. I don\u0027t know exactly. But you know, after the war, nobody has money. Soccer is the cheapest sport. No courts, nothing. So we all start to play soccer, and after I was 10 years old, I went to a little club in Munich. When I was 13 years old, I moved to Bayern, Munich, and when I was 18, I was a professional.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Franz smiles at the mention of Manhattan. \"When I signed the contract, they asked me where I wanted to stay. In the suburbs? I said no, I want to stay in the city. A friend of mine knows a businessman who lives beside the Central Park. He is most of the year outside the country. The apartment was free, and he let me have it for six months. I was very lucky. I like to walk around the park to watch the people. I have been to Lincoln Center a few times, and of course different shows on Broadway. But I never saw a city like New York. You have so many good restaurants. It\u0027s unbelievable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n During the off-season, Franz does some promotional work for both Mercedes-Benz and Adidas, the sporting goods company that manufactures, among other things, a Franz Beckenbauer soccer shoe. As a result, Franz, who will be 33 next month, is not at all worried about his future. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know, when I started with soccer as a professional,\" he explains, \"I had an aim. I said when I\u0027m finished with soccer, my life will be different. I can say, \u0027I want to do this and this,\u0027 and not \u0027I must do this.\u0027 When I finish my career, I would like to go through the United States in a mobile with my family, to see all the states. That\u0027s for sure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44900.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
