{"id":1280,"no":42,"title":"EASTSIDER BRIAN KEITH","content":"EASTSIDER BRIAN KEITH Back on Broadway after 27 years 12-29-79 On January 1, 1980, the curtain will finally ring down on Da, Hugh Leonard\u0027s strikingly original and poignant drama about a man\u0027s fond memories of his working-class Irish father. Da won four Tony Awards in 1978, including Best Play. Since July 30, the title role has been ably filled by Brian Keith, an actor perhaps best known for playing \"Uncle Bill\" in the situation comedy Family Affair, one of television\u0027s most popular shows from 1966 to 1971. Recently he has been seen in the TV specials Centennial, The Chisholms and The Seekers. In his long, illustrious career, the 57-year-old actor has starred in four other TV series and appeared in more than 60 motion pictures. During the late 1940s, when he worked primarily on Broadway, Keith rented an apartment on East 66th Street with a fireplace and kitchen for $70 a month. Leaving for Hollywood in 1952, he eventually married a Hawaiian actress, and nine years ago became a full-time resident of Hawaii. \"I hadn\u0027t been to New York for years and years and years, and when we came here for a vacation last winter, I saw a play every night for a couple of weeks,\" says Keith. \"Da was the only one I thought I\u0027d really like to do sometime.\" Not long afterward, Barnard Hughes, the Tony Award winning star of Da, decided to tour with the show, and Keith was offered a five-month contract to replace him. Delighted with the chance to return to Broadway in such a compelling role after a 27-year absence, Keith quickly said yes. Bringing his wife and children to New York for an extended visit, he again chose the Upper East Side as a place to live. A big, brawny 6-footer whose deep, gravelly voice and slothful mannerisms somehow bring to mind a friendly trained bear, Keith normally spends the time between his matinee and evening performances sleeping on an Army cot in his dressing room. On this particular day, he is sitting in the sparsely furnished room with his shirt off, smoking a cigarette and answering questions about his career. His initially gruff demeanor soon gives way to laughter, sentiment, hopefulness and cynicism in equal measure. A no-holds-barred conversationalist, he talks about the acting life with a rare frankness. Taking over the role of Da with only about 20 hours of rehearsal, says Keith, was \"just a matter of trouping it.\" He didn\u0027t find the task too difficult, partly because of his Irish background. Asked how far back his ancestry goes, Keith laughs and says, \"How far back? If you go back far enough, you never stop. I\u0027m Irish on both sides. On my father\u0027s side they came over in Revolutionary days. On my mother\u0027s side, five or six generations. It stays, though. The first time I went to Ireland, I felt the whole deja vu thing. I knew what I\u0027d see around the next corner when I walked.\" He was born in the backstage of a theatre in Bayonne, New Jersey. \"I was there about a week. I\u0027m always getting letter from people saying: \u0027I\u0027m from Bayonne too!\u0027 My parents were actors, so we went everywhere. … I went to high school in Long Island. Very … very nothing. And I didn\u0027t care a damn thing about acting.\" \u003eFrom 1945 to 1955 he served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a sergeant in the Pacific campaign. \"When I got out of the service, I was just banging around, looking for a job. I didn\u0027t have an education or anything. A guy offered me a part in a play and I didn\u0027t know whether I\u0027d ever get another one. But I did, so it\u0027s been very nice. Very lucky. It\u0027s unlike the usual struggle that people go through.\" When the conversation lands on Meteor, his latest movie, Keith declines comment, choosing to speak instead of The Last of the Mountain Men, a feature film that was completed in July and is scheduled for a Easter release. \"Charlton Heston and I co-star. It\u0027s about two trappers in the West in 1830, and what happens to them when the beaver period comes to a close. The two guys are like Sundance and Butch. But damn well written. It\u0027s one of the best scripts I ever read. Heston\u0027s kid wrote it. He worked for a couple of years up around Idaho and Montana as a river guide. There\u0027s not a wasted word in the script.\" Many of his films and TV shows Keith has never seen. \"If it\u0027s some piece of junk, I don\u0027t see why I should bother. It\u0027s bad enough you did it. But to live through it again!. … You can\u0027t sit around and wait for something you think is worthy of you.\" Brian and his wife Victoria have two children. Mimi, his daughter from a previous marriage, is a member of the Pennsylvania Ballet Company. Between acting assignments, says Keith with affection, he spends most of his time \"raising the damn kids. It\u0027s a 24-hour job. We do a lot of outdoor stuff, because in Hawaii you can, all year round. We go on the beach and camp out and all that crap.\" He finds that being based in Hawaii causes no problems with his career. \"It doesn\u0027t make any difference where you live,\" Keith growls softly. \"People live in London, in Spain, in Switzerland. You don\u0027t go around looking for jobs. You wait till your agent calls you and you get on a plane and go. You can be halfway around the world overnight, from anywhere. It beats Bayonne.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44933.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
