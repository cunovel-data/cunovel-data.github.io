{"id":1286,"no":48,"title":"EASTSIDER JOHN LEONARD","content":"EASTSIDER JOHN LEONARD \n Book critic for the New York Times \n \n 3-22-80 \n \n \"It\u0027s as if the job I have were designed for me,\" says bearded, bespectacled John Leonard, lighting his fifth cigarette of the early afternoon as he sits relaxed at his Eastside brownstone, talking about the pleasures and perils of being one of the New York Times\u0027 three daily book critics. Like his colleagues Christopher Lehmann-Haupt and Anatole Broyard, Leonard writes two book reviews for the Times each week, and is syndicated nationally. An avid reader since childhood, he now gets to read anything and everything he desires. \n \n That\u0027s the advantage. The disadvantage, explains Leonard, is that \"there are 50 thousand books published every year in this country. You can never even pretend to be comprehensive. You can\u0027t even pretend to be adequate in your coverage, whereas the Times will review almost any play that opens, on or Off Broadway, and almost every concert and movie. We\u0027ll review maybe 400 books a year in the daily paper.\" \n \n A smallish, balding man of 41 who dresses purely for comfort and has a calm, refined speaking manner, Leonard looks precisely like the bookworm he is. \"I\u0027ll get here, in this house, probably 5,000 or 6,000 books a year, mailed to me, or brought by messenger. The luxury of this job is that there\u0027s so much to choose from that any mood or interest or compulsion or desire to educate oneself or amuse oneself can be matched by some book that has come in.\" \n \n New books by well-known authors, he says, are the first priority because \"they\u0027ve earned reviews, for service to the literary culture over the years.\" He and his two fellow critics \"divide up the plums and divide up the dogs. Since I did Kissinger\u0027s memoirs, the next huge, endless book that has to be reviewed, whether anybody wants to review it or not, will not be reviewed by me.\" \n \n Somewhere between 100 and 140 serious first novels are published in the U.S. each year, according to Leonard. \"This is not pulp paperback westerns. It doesn\u0027t even count science fiction or gothic or all that. I think a special effort is made by all of us in the reviewing racket to review first novels.\" \n \n He reads many authors\u0027 first books on the recommendation of trusted agents and publishers. \"Over the years you decide who isn\u0027t lying to you. … Christopher Lehmann-Haupt was telling someone about that the other day. He said, \u0027Sure, you can call me as often as you want. But I\u0027ll say that you begin with a hundred dollars in you bank account, and if it turns out that you are begging me to review a book that has no other redeeming virtues but the fact that you have invested 50 or 80 thousand dollars\u0027 worth of advertising in it and you\u0027ve got too many copies out in the bookstores that aren\u0027t moving, that bank account goes down. When you give me a real surprise and a pleasure which is what makes this job worthwhile, the bank account goes up. But if the bank account goes down to zero, it\u0027s closed.\u0027 \n \n \"And that\u0027s right. There are people in this town who I won\u0027t take a telephone call from. But that\u0027s the exception.\" \n \n Apart from reading, writing and travel, Leonard has few interests. \"By May, I can even look healthy, because I just sit out in the garden, getting paid to read,\" he says with a grin. He and his wife Sue, a schoolteacher, have three children from previous marriages. His son Andrew will be starting college in the fall. \n \n A book reviewer since 1967, including a five-year stint as editor of the Sunday Times Book Review, Leonard also write a warmly personal, frequently humorous column in the Wednesday Times titled \"Private Lives.\" A collection of 69 of the columns appeared in book form last year under the title Private Lives in the Imperial City (Knopf, $8.95). In addition, he has published four novels and hundreds of free-lance articles for magazines ranging from Playboy to the New Republic. For years he wrote TV reviews for Life magazine under the pseudonym \"Cyclops.\" Recalls Leonard: \"It was a good way to turn your brain to Spam.\" \n \n Born in Washington, D.C., he grew up reading the Congressional Record instead of comics, and initially planned a career in law. Booted out of Harvard for neglecting his studies in favor of the campus newspaper, he sharpened his journalistic skills under William F. Buckley Jr. at the National Review before completing college at the University of California\u0027s Berkeley campus. Following graduation, he became the program director of a radio station, wrote his first two novels, and worked in an anti-poverty program in Boston. Then he was invited to join the Times. \"I did my Westside and Village stuff when I was first here and broke,\" comments Leonard. He has owned his four-story Eastside house since 1971. \n \n Among the most memorable books that Leonard has helped to \"discover\" are Joseph Heller\u0027s Catch-22 and Gunter Grass\u0027s The Tin Drum. \"To be able to sit down one night, as I did, and to realize you\u0027re in the presence of an extraordinary talent, with no advance publicity, to be able to have a hole to fill in the paper two days later, to sit down and pull out all your adjectives and get people to buy the book: this is what you live for,\" he sighs happily. \"You only need two or three of those to last a lifetime.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44939.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
