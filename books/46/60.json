{"id":1298,"no":60,"title":"WESTSIDER MICHAEL MORIARTY","content":"WESTSIDER MICHAEL MORIARTY \n Star of Holocaust returns to Broadway in G.R. Point \n \n 5-5-79 \n \n When Michael Moriarty rose to national stardom last year with his chilling portrayal of SS Officer Dorf in the NBC miniseries Holocaust, his performance was witnessed by some 120 million Americans. His current vehicle, G.R. Point at the Playhouse Theatre on West 48th Street plays to a maximum audience of 500. Yet, in the lead role of Micah Bradstreet, a wet-behind-the-ears soldier from rural Maine, Moriarty delivers what Clive Barnes of the New York Post has said is \"the best performance, so far, of his career.\" \n \n G.R. Point is a play about the Vietnam War and its effects on those who are forced to partake in it. Set on a strikingly designed stage built to resemble a devastated hillside, the play demonstrates how each of the eight characters manages to cope with his predicament in his own way. Its message is summed up in the final words of the drama, spoken to Micah as he departs for the U.S.: he is told to \"count the living, not the dead.\" \n \n \"One of the main reasons I wanted to do this play is that it affirms life,\" says Moriarty, in a dressing room interview just before a performance. \"It doesn\u0027t take any specific political stance, but it doesn\u0027t avoid any of the horrors of war. Its only stance is: in the end, what overcomes the situation is love. And love sometimes shows itself in the strangest, most bizarre ways.\" \n \n He is tall and solidly built, looking somewhat younger than his 38 years, and though his demeanor has an edge of shyness to it, Moriarty\u0027s penetrating eyes reveal that much is going on beneath the surface. Asked about his personal views on Vietnam, the actor replies, \"I\u0027m not an intellectual, so I have no specific feelings about it.\" But his conversation soon reveals him to be a deep thinker and a wit besides, whose remarks are tempered as much by humility as by professional instinct. \n \n \"Whatever I could say about the war has been better stated by David Berry, the playwright. I\u0027m able to show my emotional response to the war through Micah Bradstreet. … I\u0027m not trying to influence anyone in any way in particular. I do think the play tells the truth about Vietnam. So the more information people have, the better decisions they can make.\" \n \n Moriarty\u0027s decision to become a dramatic actor can be traced to his undergraduate days at Dartmouth College, when he was overwhelmed by Paul Scofield\u0027s performance in Love\u0027s Labor Lost. Following graduation, he won a Fulbright Scholarship to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. In 1974, after years of perfecting his craft in theatres across America, he picked up the first of his two Tony Awards for his performances in Find Your Way Home. Equally skilled at television acting, he is the recipient of two Emmys, including one for Holocaust. \n \n A Detroit native of Scandinavian and Irish ancestry, Moriarty attends Catholic mass regularly, and finds much inspiration in the Bible, both spiritual and literary. His chief hobby is music: he is a polished singer/pianist/songwriter who frequently performs in the city\u0027s leading nightclubs between acting assignments. Asked whether he would consider teaming up with octogenarian blues singer Alberta Hunter at the Cookery in Greenwich Village, he replies with a laugh, \"That\u0027s very heavy company. I\u0027ll cook and she\u0027ll sing.\" He usually practices in the morning. \"I\u0027ll ramble over the piano and play some easy music. It\u0027s purely according to my libido. You might call it ad libido. Hey, not bad! How\u0027s that for an album title?\" \n \n Another of his talents is writing plays. Although hesitant to discuss this up-and-coming aspect of his career, Moriarty finally admits that one of his plays was recently read dramatically at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey, under the direction of Ben Levit. \"It was none of my doing. I sat back, and it all happened before my very eyes. I was astonished, and pleased, and proud, and in no great hurry to see it produced except by this director — if he wants to.\" \n \n Long a devotee of Shakespeare, Moriarty founded his own non-profit \n Shakespearean company, Potter\u0027s Field, in 1977. He and his group \n perform free each Sunday in Central Park near the statue of Sir Walter \n Scott, weather permitting. \n \n In response to a question about the West Side, where he has lived for the past five years, Moriarty says that \"you can walk one block and encounter everything the world should either be proud of or ashamed of.\" His favorite local restaurants include Coq du Vin on 8th Avenue and O\u0027Neal\u0027s Balloon at 6th Avenue and 57th Street. \"Pat O\u0027Neal and I crack jokes about my career as a waiter. I worked at O\u0027Neal\u0027s off and on for about four years. I was terrible! They kept me on out of sheer compassion. I guess I became an endearing lunkhead.\" \n \n Other goals? \"None that I\u0027d care to mention,\" says Moriarty, smiling softly. \"All the other ones are neurotic, and I don\u0027t want to expose them. I\u0027ve done it too often. In my neuroses, I think, \u0027Gee, I\u0027d like to do that or this.\u0027 But in my higher self, I have no unfulfilled needs.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44985.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
