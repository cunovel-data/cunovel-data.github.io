{"id":1331,"no":93,"title":"EASTSIDER ANDY WARHOL","content":"EASTSIDER ANDY WARHOL \\n\\n Pop artist and publisher of Interview magazine \\n\\n \\n\\n 4-7-79 \\n\\n \\n\\n He is the great enigma of American art. Some of his most famous paintings are exercises in monotony. His movies often put the viewer to sleep. As a conversationalist, he can be low-keyed to the point of dullness: speaking softly in a slow-paced, emotionless voice, he relies heavily on short sentences, long pauses, and an abundance of \"ums\" and \"uhs.\" However, he has one asset that overshadows everything negative that might be said or written about him: his name happens to be Andy Warhol. \\n\\n \\n\\n The only time I met Warhol in person was at a book publication party several months ago. He came by himself, spoke to hardly anyone, and spent most of his brief visit flitting quietly about the room, avoiding people\u0027s eyes and taking snapshots of the more celebrated guests. With his pale complexion, narrow frame, and hair like bleached straw, he looked not unlike a scarecrow. Everywhere he went, heads turned to catch a glimpse. That has been the story of Warhol\u0027s life ever since he rose to international prominence in the 1960s. \\n\\n \\n\\n Although he did not feel like talking when I met him, Andy — never publicity-shy — agreed to a telephone interview at a later date. Reached at the offices of his Interview magazine off union Square, he answered all my questions briefly, and in a voice so low that he could barely be heard. \\n\\n \\n\\n Interview, the monthly tabloid-shaped magazine that he publishes, is Warhol\u0027s most visible creative project at the moment. \"It\u0027s been going for about seven or eight years,\" he said. \"I started it for Brigid Berlin. Her father ran the Hearst Corporation. She didn\u0027t want to work on it.\" The person on the cover of each issue is identified only on the inside, and many of the faces are difficult to recognize. Some are genuine celebrities, such as Truman Capote, who has a regular column. Others are young unknowns who have caught Warhol\u0027s fancy. The ultramodern layout includes many full-page ads for some of the most expensive shops in Manhattan. The interviews, interspersed with many photos, lean heavily on show business personalities, models, artists, writers and fashion people. In most cases, the \"interviews\" are actually group discussions — often with Andy himself taking part — that are printed verbatim. Even the most mundane comments are not cut. \\n\\n \\n\\n The reason? \"I used to carry a tape recorder with me all the time, so this was a way to use it,\" said Warhol. But in truth, the literal transcriptions are another example of the naturalism that characterizes much of his work. When he turned his attention from painting and drawing to filmmaking in 1963, he became notorious for such movies as Sleep, which showed a man sleeping for six hours, and Empire, which he made by aiming his camera at the Empire State Building and keeping the film running for eight straight hours. \\n\\n \\n\\n According to Warhol, many people have turned down his request for interviews. \"It\u0027s hard to get Robert Redford. … We choose people who like to talk a lot.\" The type of reader he seeks to attract is \"the rich audience. People who go to places like Christie\u0027s and Fiorucci\u0027s. … It\u0027s fun to go to those places and get invited to parties. I love fashion parties. Shoe parties are even better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His affection for shoes dates back to 1949, when, in his first year in New York, he got a job in the art department of a shoe store. His designs and magazine illustrations caught on so fast that within a year, he was able to purchase the town house on the Upper East Side, where he still lives with his mother. \"But mostly I live with my two dachshunds. They\u0027ve taken over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Certain facts abut Andy Warhol\u0027s early life remain a mystery because he has always objected to questions that he considers irrelevant to an understanding of him as an artist. It is known that he was born somewhere in Pennsylvania, sometime between 1927 and 1931, to a family of immigrants from Czechoslovakia named Warhola. \\n\\n \\n\\n By his mid-20s, Warhol was one of the most sought-after commercial artists in the field. His silk-screen prints of Campbell\u0027s soup cans made him famous with the general public, and by the mid-1960s he was clearly the most highly celebrated \"plastic artist\" — a title he relishes — in the English-speaking world. \\n\\n \\n\\n In recent years, his creative output has been reduced somewhat, as the result of the severe wounds he sustained in June, 1968, when a deranged woman shot him in his office. Nevertheless, he continues to mount gallery exhibitions, write books and paint portraits. The Whitney Museum (75th St. at Madison Ave.) will have a show of his portraits in December. \\n\\n \\n\\n Asked about the East Side, Warhol said that one of his favorite activities is to go window shopping. \"When you live on the East Side, you don\u0027t have to go far. Because usually everything happens here.\" When he goes to the West Side, it\u0027s often to visit Studio 54. \"I only go there to see my friend Steve Rubell. Afterwards, we usually go to Cowboys and Cowgirls.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n About the only medium that Warhol has not worked in is television. \"Oh, I always wanted to, yeah,\" was his parting comment. \"It just never happens. The stations think we\u0027re not Middle America.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45038.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
