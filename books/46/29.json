{"id":1267,"no":29,"title":"WESTSIDER RALPH GINZBURG","content":"WESTSIDER RALPH GINZBURG Publisher of Moneysworth 7-8-78 Less than two months ago, the U.S. Supreme Court passed an edict allowing the police to raid the files of newspaper offices in search of information relating to a crime. \"If they came here, I\u0027d stand at the entrance and block their way,\" says Ralph Ginzburg, gazing out the window at his suite of offices near Columbus Circle. \"I don\u0027t care if they arrest me,\" he adds in his thick Brooklyn accent. The owlish-looking Ginzburg means what he says. He\u0027s the publisher of Moneysworth, which is mailed each month to 1.2 million subscribers. It is the most successful item he has ever published, but there is no doubt that he would risk losing it and going to jail, because Ginzburg has done so already. In a flamboyant career marked by much notoriety, he has emerged as one of the most important figures of his generation in expanding the freedom of the press. Of the six magazines and newspapers that Ginzburg has founded, none has caused such a stir as his first one, Eros, which lasted from 1962 to 1963. \"It was the first really classy magazine on love and sex in American history,\" he says. \"I signed up 100,000 subscribers right away, at $50 a year. Many leading American artists contributed to it. The big difference is that it was sold entirely through the mails. Our promotion of subscriptions through the mail got a lot of complaints.\" About 35,000 complaints, in fact — more than the U.S. Post Office had ever received up to that time. Ralph Ginzburg was charged with sending obscene material through the mails, and Eros was forced to suspend publication while the debate went on. Most Washington lawyers, after examining the magazine, concluded that it was not obscene. But the case became a political issue, and in 1972, 10 years after the so-called crime had taken place, Ginzburg was ordered to serve an eight-month term at the federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. His imprisonment led to a nationwide outcry by intellectuals and public officials. Not long after the demise of Eros, Ginzburg started another magazine called Fact. It, too, ended over a lawsuit. This time the plaintiff was U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater. He sued the magazine for $2 million on the charge of libel, and was awarded $65,000 in damages. \"It was a compromise, as jury decisions frequently are,\" remarks Ginzburg. \"Unfortunately I didn\u0027t have very much money back then, and it wiped us out.\" Describing the case, he said: \"In 1964, when Goldwater was running for president, he advocated the use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam. I thought the guy was out of his mind and I wondered if anyone else had the same suspicion. … We polled all the members of the American Medical Association who were listed as psychiatrists and asked them if they thought Goldwater was fit to be president. We printed their replies and their long-distance diagnoses … \" Both the Eros case and the Goldwater case made the American public examine some far-reaching questions: What is obscene? What is libelous? Ginzburg helped to establish new definitions for these terms, and in so doing, widened the power of the press. Avant-Garde, his third publication, existed from 1967 to 1970. \"It was born during the Vietnam uprising in this country,\" he explains. \"It was a magazine of art and politics, and had no ad revenue.\" In the same year that Avant-Garde folded, he began a newsletter called Moneysworth. Soon it expanded into a full-sized newspaper. \"It was launched,\" says Ginzburg, \"because we felt that the only existing periodical in the area of consumer interest — Consumer Reports — wasn\u0027t broad enough. Spending money is more than buying appliances.\" While Moneysworth does carry many valuable tips on personal finance, it also has a considerable amount of sensationalism that would seem at home in the National Enquirer. Even so, Ginzburg\u0027s managerial skills, his nonstop working habits, and his literary expertise — he has written several books — have made Moneysworth a winner. Using the same staff of 40, along with many free-lance writers, he now publishes two other monthly newspapers as well, American Business and Extra! He has been a Westsider for 15 years, and his publishing company, Avant-Garde Media, is located on West 57th Street. If Ginzburg has a single goal right now, it\u0027s \"to saved up enough money to enable me to put out a periodical exactly like Avant-Garde was. It was pure pleasure for me: there was no commercial compromise. But even though this is a multimillion-dollar corporation here, I can\u0027t afford it at the moment. … Money is important in publishing. I have to spend 99 percent of my time and effort chasing the buck. I guess I\u0027m lucky. Most people spend 100 percent of their time that way.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44920.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
