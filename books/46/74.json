Four days later, on Black Thursday, Wall Street would be rocked by the biggest losses in its history and the nation would be plunged into its greatest crisis since the Civil War. But October 20 still belonged to the Roaring Twenties, and on that date the most highly publicized event to take place in Manhattan was a violin concert by a 9-year-old wunderkind named Ruggiero Ricci, who delivered a flawless performance of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto and was lauded as a genius by the city\u0027s leading music critics. That concert made Ricci\u0027s career; in the 10 years that followed, the boy virtuoso earned an annual salary higher than that of the president of the United States. \\n\\n \\n\\n The story might have ended there, but unlike most prodigies, who burn themselves out early, Ruggiero Ricci has continued to grow in stature as an artist. Since the 1940s he has been considered one of the greatest living violinists, and, with more than 500 recordings to his credit, he is the most-recorded soloist, instrumental or vocal, in the world today. Especially in demand abroad, he has made five trips to Australia and three to the Soviet union, where he was obliged to play nine encores at his debut appearance. Twenty of his concerts in West Germany were sold out a year in advance, and more than a dozen of his South American tours have been sellouts as well. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I travel most of the year, except maybe a month off in the summer,\" says Ricci, a short, good-humored man of 60 with large, sparkling eyes, jet black brows, and a soft, slightly accented voice that sounds as if he were born in Europe. He sits curled up in a corner of the couch in his magnificent Westside apartment. \"I dislike to travel. In the old days, there were a lot of airplane breakdowns, and we were always hung up in airports waiting for them to fix the plane. Today they have all these hijacking searches. You have to go through the machines; they have these enormous lines. And when you get to the hotel, there\u0027s a line a mile long.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He believes that Russian audiences are \"the best public in the world. They don\u0027t applaud between the movements, like they do in New York. … It\u0027s always interesting to visit a place for the first time. I don\u0027t want to go to Russia so much anymore. We found out it\u0027s boring. There\u0027s nothing to do. And it\u0027s not much fun. There\u0027s no tipping, so the hotel service is very bad. It takes an hour to get breakfast; you can sit there and be completely ignored by the waiter. To make a telephone call: it\u0027s easier to go to the moon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ricci\u0027s repertoire, which includes more than 60 concertos from the 17th to the 20th centuries, is the largest of any violinist\u0027s now before the public. This calls for a lot of practice. \"When you\u0027re a kid,\" says Ricci, \"you hate to practice. And when you\u0027re a grownup, practice is a pleasure. It lets you escape all the other junk. … I don\u0027t have any trouble practicing in this building, because the old buildings have heavy walls. But if you want to practice in a hotel, that\u0027s hard. Sometimes you can use a mute. Or you turn on the television. Then they don\u0027t complain. If they hear a fiddle, they complain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ricci has two major concerts in New York this year. The first will take place at Carnegie Hall on Saturday, March 3, when Ricci will join such celebrities as Andres Segovia, Yehudi Menuhin, Jose Ferrer, Jean-Pierre Rampal, and Peter Ustinov for a historic musical program to commemorate the 15th anniversary of Symphonicum Europae, a foundation whose aim is to promote international understanding and cooperation by sponsoring performances in every country. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ricci\u0027s other New York concert will mark another anniversary. It will be on October 20th — 50 years to the day since he took the city by storm. \"The early concerts I remember very well,\" says the maestro, who was born in San Francisco to a family of Italian immigrants. \"For most prodigies, the problem is the parents. My father just wasn\u0027t every smart about how to handle me. Nowadays they don\u0027t have prodigies anymore because there isn\u0027t any profit in it. In the old days, a kid could get $2,500 to $3000 dollars a night. Everybody had their kid study.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n None of his five children has turned out to be a prodigy, but three of them are already professionals in the performing arts. Ricci\u0027s slender, attractive wife, Julia, is an active participant in his career. Westsiders for many years, the Riccis enjoy such local restaurants as La Tablita, Alfredo\u0027s and the Cafe des Artistes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Asked what he likes best about his career, Ricci says it is making recordings. \"It\u0027s more leisurely. You don\u0027t have all the headaches. … The newest development is direct-to-disc records. The music goes straight from the mike into the cutting head master, and there\u0027s no way to erase. If it\u0027s a 20-minute recording and you make a mistake on the 19th minute, you have to start over. I just finished recording the Paganini Caprices on direct-to-disc. It\u0027s coming out this month. The caprices are very rarely performed in public, because they\u0027re so difficult.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44999.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
