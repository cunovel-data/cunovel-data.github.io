{"id":1325,"no":87,"title":"WESTSIDER GREGG SMITH","content":"WESTSIDER GREGG SMITH Founder and conductor of the Gregg Smith Singers 1-28-78 What might you guess about a man who has composed 60 major choral works, toured the world with his singing group, and recorded 50 albums including three Grammy Award winners? If you didn\u0027t know anything else about this man, you would probably guess, first, that he is rich. Then you might imagine that his door is constantly bombarded by recording agents trying to enlist his talents. And third, you would probably think that his name is a household word. But Westsider Gregg Smith has all of the qualifications listed and none of the imagined results. This is because his music happens to be classical — a field in which, he says, \"a record that sells 10,000 copies is considered a good hit.\" Conducting his choral group, the Gregg Smith Singers, who usually have anywhere from 16 to 32 voices, he performs works spanning the last four centuries of the Western classical tradition. Gregg writes most of the arrangements himself. Last year his sheet music sales reached 60,000 copies. The Gregg Smith Singers specialize in pieces that have been infrequently performed or recorded. But a more lengthy description of their music can only tell what it is, not how it sounds. Music speaks for itself better than any words can describe. \"None of the American composers of today are making a living,\" says Gregg, shaking his head. We\u0027re sitting in his spacious but unluxurious apartment near Lincoln Center. \"It\u0027s a terrible struggle. When people talk about ghetto areas, let me tell you, no one is more in a ghetto than the American classical composer. We have more great composers in this country right now than any other country in the word, and the United States supports its composers less than any other country. … They want so desperately to perform their music. A composer does a piece and gets a performance in New York, and that may be the last performance it ever gets.\" He leads me to a room lined with shelves, boxes and cabinets filled with sheet music, some of it in manuscript. This is where Gregg chooses each new selection for his group. He shrugs at the enormity of the task. \"There are at least 400 new American compositions here, waiting to be looked at. Probably at least 100 of them are of the highest quality. … When we record this type of material, we don\u0027t expect to make a profit, even with the royalties over the years. Classical records are made because the music needs to be heard. It\u0027s a second form of publication. We do it as a means of getting this music out.\" The same economic rule holds true when the Singers do a concert. Because of the large size of the group and the vast amount of rehearsal time needed to perfect new works or new arrangements, the box office receipts don\u0027t come close to meeting the expenses. The grants they receive from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council for the Arts are not always sufficient. \"Like every one of the arts, it\u0027s a constant deficit operation. At this point, we\u0027re not nearly as strong in fund-raising as in the other aspects.\" In spite of the financial pressures, Gregg does manage to provide his Singers with about 25 weeks of full-time work per year. His group has gone on a national tour for 15 consecutive years so far. The Singers have performed in every state except Alaska. They have made four tours of Europe and one of the Far East. Their typical New York season included four concerts at Alice Tully Hall and a contemporary music festival in one of the local churches. This year the three-day festival will be held in St. Peter\u0027s Church located in the Citicorp Center starting on April 20. A native of Chicago, Gregg attended college in Los Angeles and founded the Gregg Smith Singers there in 1955. His talent as a conductor and arranger soon came to the attention of the late Igor Stravinsky, the Russian-born composer who was then living in California. The pair eventually recorded more than a dozen albums together. When Stravinsky died in 1971, Gregg was invited to Venice, Italy, to prepare the chorus and orchestra for the rites in honor of the late maestro. In all his travels, Gregg and his wife Rosalind have found no place where they would feel so much at home as the West Side. \"It\u0027s a great, wonderful community for the classical musician,\" he says. \"It\u0027s one of the most vibrant, alive, sometimes terrifying but always exciting, places to live.\" Perhaps Gregg\u0027s rarest quality is his unselfishness toward other American composers. His biggest concern seems to be: how will be manage to get all their works recorded? \"I have enough important recordings to do,\" he says in a voice hovering between joy and frustration, \"to keep me busy for five years. That would mean literally hundreds of thousands of dollars.\" The money may come or it may not. But the worth of Gregg Smith, gentleman artist, is beyond price.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45032.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
