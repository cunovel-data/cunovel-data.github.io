{"id":1251,"no":13,"title":"WESTSIDER HUGH CAREY","content":"WESTSIDER HUGH CAREY \\n\\n Governor of New York state \\n\\n \\n\\n 9-16-78 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was 5 p.m. on the Friday before Labor Day. Governor Hugh Carey sat alone in his office on West 55th Street, rubbing his forehead wearily with both hands when his assistant press secretary, Judy Deich, ushered me in. The introductions were brief, and the governor spoke very rapidly, keeping is eyes on the table in front of him, where he was scrawling pencil lines in geometric patterns on a piece of blank paper, as if to maintain his concentration. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Governor had been up for 12 hours, and his voice occasionally faded to a whisper, but he answered all the questions with a flair and displayed a sincere manner throughout. Sitting kitty-corner to me at a conference table, he looked smaller and thinner than his photographs. He also looked like one of the tiredest, most overworked men I had ever met. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have been staying on the West Side a lot since last September,\" he said. \"That\u0027s when my sons Donald and Michael got an apartment near Central Park. They\u0027re kind enough to put me up there. We have the usual tenants\u0027 complaints about the leaky ceilings and peeling paint. All in all, it\u0027s a good building. I find more and more advantages to living on the West Side. I like it because of the accessibility to work and because I jog in Central Park. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One of my headaches is Central Park. Some of my colleagues would like to make it a national park. It\u0027s the city\u0027s biggest showplace. … I want to get the automobiles out of there more and more. In the morning, I see all the New Jersey cars coming through. That\u0027s why I want Westway below 42d Street — so it will take more pressure off the city. … I wish everyone would realize that Westway is not a road. It\u0027s a recessed highway — more of a tunnel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Speaking frankly of the problem of ex-mental patients in parts of the West Side, Carey said that \"we have indexed all the SRO\u0027s. That was never done before. … The homeless people who live on the street are not the wards of the state. We can\u0027t just go out and pick them up. … If they need some kind of health care, they should be taken to a shelter and given health care. If they resist, we will have peace officers to take care of them. That\u0027s something I\u0027m doing with Mayor Koch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ever since he defeated Nelson Rockefeller\u0027s appointed successor, Malcolm Wilson, in 1974, Hugh Carey has become well known for both his conservative moral code and his unswerving fiscal restraint. Born on April 11, 1919, to an Irish Catholic family in Brooklyn, Carey grew up with five brothers believing in certain principles that he has never abandoned. These moral principles have become the foundation of his controversial stands on the death penalty and abortion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am against the death penalty,\" said Carey, \"because the government can make a mistake. A sentence of life without parole is better. There are six people now walking around the state who were condemned to death and later proven innocent. One is named Zimmy and he works on the West Side in a garment factory. Somebody should ask him what he thinks about the death penalty. He\u0027s alive because somebody confessed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I oppose abortion personally. But the Supreme Court upheld that it\u0027s the choice of a woman of her own free will, and I support that ruling. In New York, the state pays for it if it\u0027s a matter of medical necessity. Otherwise, there might be a mangled body in a back alley. … I\u0027m also advocating an alternative — a teenage pregnancy bill, where girls can have a baby without shame and go back to school. It\u0027s the most common reason for dropouts among teenagers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n During World War II, Hugh Carey fought in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany, and attained the rank of major. After the service, he worked for many years as an executive in his brother Edward\u0027s Peerless Oil and Chemical Corporation. Not until 1960, when he was 41 years old, did Carey decide to run for political office. He won his first congressional race and during the 1960s developed a national reputation for his liberal attitude on education, and programs for the elderly and handicapped. \\n\\n \\n\\n His life has twice been touched by deep personal tragedy in recent years. An automobile accident in 1969 took the lives of his two eldest sons, and cancer claimed his wife Helen in 1974. A man who loves the company of other people, Carey enjoys such simple pleasures as cooking with friends and singing with his children. \\n\\n \\n\\n Asked about the chief difference between himself and Republican challenger Perry Duryea, the governor replied with obvious glee: \"I can\u0027t think of anything we have in common. … I\u0027ll knock the Y right out of his name before I\u0027m finished.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Generally known to be at his best in times of crisis, Carey said that whenever the pressures of his office become too great for him to handle alone, he drops into the chapel and asks for help. \"It\u0027s a matter of privacy to me; I go where I\u0027m not seen,\" he said. \"I need help quite a lot. Also, I believe that New York is a very special place, with a resourcefulness that can\u0027t be matched anywhere in the world. When people have come together as New Yorkers, they have done amazing things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44904.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
