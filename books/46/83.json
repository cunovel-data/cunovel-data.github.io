{"id":1321,"no":83,"title":"WESTSIDER REID SHELTON","content":"WESTSIDER REID SHELTON \n The big-hearted billionaire of Annie \n \n 12-22-79 \n \n Annie, the touching musical about seven little orphan girls in New York City at Christmastime during the Great Depression, has been the Broadway show against which all others must be compared ever since it opened in April, 1977. \n \n That year it won seven Tony Awards. Later the movie rights were sold for a record $9.5 million. There are now companies performing the musical in Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, England, South Africa, Australia, Japan and Scandinavia. The album has gone gold. Still a sellout virtually every night at the Alvin Theatre, its tickets are the hardest to obtain of any show in town. \n \n Two of the three leading characters — those of Annie and the cruel, gin sodden orphanage director Miss Hannigan — have been twice replaced by new performers. But Oliver \"Daddy\" Warbucks, the bald-headed billionaire with a heart as big as his bank account, has been played since the beginning by Reid Shelton, a Westside actor long known for his portrayal of powerful figures on stage — cardinals and kings, statesmen and presidents. \n \n On December 23rd, just a few days short of its 1,200th performance, Reid will finally leave the New York company to star in Annie on the West Coast. He has no plans, at this point, of giving up the role that earned him a Tony nomination for Best Actor. \n \n \"I\u0027ve had two three-week vacations and I\u0027ve missed four performances in almost three years,\" says Reid in his dressing room on a recent afternoon. Easing his tall, bulky frame onto a sofa, he immediately reveals a personality that is warm, good-humored and eager to please. His broad, all-American features give distinction to his gleaming, newly shaved head. Reid shaves twice a day with an electric razor. \n \n \"My understudy plays Roosevelt in the show, and of course for the four performances that he\u0027s had to go on for me, he didn\u0027t shave his head,\" laughs the 55-year-old actor. \"I\u0027ve gotten the most angry letters from people saying, \u0027Well my God, can\u0027t you at least have the understudy shave his head? How dare you do that to us!\u0027\" \n \n Asked about his qualifications for playing a billionaire, Reid says, \"I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s my look, personality, or what, but people have always thought that I\u0027ve come from money. Actually, my family during the Depression was very poor.\" \n \n Born and raised in Salem, Oregon, he began studying voice while a high school freshman, doing chores in exchange for lessons. After graduation, he was drafted into the First Cavalry Division of the U.S. Army, fought in the Pacific, then received his master\u0027s degree in voice under the G.I. Bill. Arriving in New York City in 1951, he got a job singing at Radio City Music Hall. From there he went on to many Broadway musicals, TV shows, films and recordings. His generous income from Annie enabled him, last year, to purchase the Westside apartment building in the Theater District where he\u0027s been living since 1956. \"It\u0027s a rent-controlled building with 20 apartment units. This last year I lost four thousand dollars on it because of oil and everything, but I have never regretted buying it.\" \n \n Some behind-the-scene stories are as interesting as the show itself. Yul Brynner, for example, has refused to be photographed with Shelton: \"Maybe he\u0027s afraid if the strobes hit our glistening heads simultaneously there will be no picture.\" Sandy, the dog, was discovered in an animal shelter just one day before he was due to be put to sleep. \"It\u0027s that bored, I-don\u0027t-care quality that that dog has,\" says Reid, \"that\u0027s so endearing to the audience. He lives with his trainer and owner, Bill Berloni, a marvelous young chap who found a whole new career for himself through the dog.\" And when the subject of orphanages comes up, Reid tells of a place called the Jennie Clarkson Home in Valhalla, New York, which he visited not long ago. \n \n \"It\u0027s not exactly an orphanage, but a temporary home for girls whose families can\u0027t provide for them. They have about 40 girls who stay in cottages with cottage parents, and they go to school there. The agency works with the family by trying to find the father a job or whatever, so the girls can finally return home. … I was so impressed with the work they\u0027re doing. I\u0027m trying to raise money for it.\" \n \n He recalls visiting the White House to do a shortened version of Annie for the Carters. \"We got back at 3 in the morning, totally exhausted, but the whole day was made worthwhile when Mrs. Carter sought me out and said, \u0027You know, I must tell you how much I appreciate your taking your day off to come down here and do this for us. It must be a real chore, and I do appreciate it.\u0027 It was just a wonderful, wonderful personal thing that she didn\u0027t have to do. It\u0027s something I will always treasure.\" \n \n On another occasion, says Reid, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood came backstage after a show. \"Bobby just kept crying, and Natalie finally said, \u0027For God\u0027s sake, Bob, stop it.\u0027 But he couldn\u0027t. Even now, I\u0027m terribly thrilled when people come back and say, \u0027You made me cry.\u0027 I\u0027m proud of that. If I can touch some response in people, and maybe open up something that they didn\u0027t even know they felt, that\u0027s a tremendous plus in being an actor.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45028.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
