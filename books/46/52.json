{"id":1290,"no":52,"title":"EASTSIDER JEAN MARSH","content":"EASTSIDER JEAN MARSH \\n\\n Creator and star of Upstairs, Downstairs \\n\\n \\n\\n 2-10-79 \\n\\n \\n\\n Upstairs, Downstairs, the saga of a wealthy London family and its staff of servants in the early years of the 20th century, is one of the most popular television series ever filmed. The first episode of the British-made series was released in England in 1971, and since that time more than one billion people in 40 countries have watched the exploits of the Bellamy family. Introduced to American public television in 1974, Upstairs, Downstairs won seven Emmy Awards, including one for Best Series each year it was shown. \\n\\n \\n\\n If any single performer could be said to stand out over all the others, that would be Jean marsh, who received an Emmy for Best Actress for her portrayal of Rose, the head parlormaid. But what most of Marsh\u0027s American fans fail to realize is that, with her, without would be no Upstairs, Downstairs: she co-created the show with another British actress. A New Yorker on and off for the past two decades, Jean Marsh now lives in an apartment on Manhattan\u0027s Upper East Side. It is here that I meet her to talk about Upstairs, Downstairs, which returned to American television in January with 39 hour-long segments, eight of which have never been seen before on this side of the Atlantic. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sometimes it drives me crazy that nobody ever speaks to me about anything else,\" says Jean, a slender, pretty, soft-spoken woman who has the knack of putting visitors immediately at their ease with her charm and lack of pretension. \"I start to drivel after a while, because I tell how I devised Upstairs, Downstairs and how the cast was chosen.\" There is no irritation in her voice, only humor. With her lively eyes and childlike appearance, she is reminiscent of Peter Pan. \\n\\n \\n\\n Upstairs, Downstairs, says Jean, \"didn\u0027t spring new-minted. My friend Eileen Atkins and I had been talking about trying to devise a television series. We thought we should write something we knew about — about our pasts. And it became servants more than anything else, because her father had been a butler. She was showing me pictures of her family one day; she had photographs of servants going to a pub in a horse-drawn bus. So the first thing we wrote about was servants going on an outing. And later we decided it wouldn\u0027t be nearly as interesting unless we included the people upstairs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jean herself was born in a poor section of London, the daughter of a laborer and a barmaid. From her earliest years she aimed for a show business career as the surest route out of her social class. She began as a dancer — \"I could teach classical ballet or tap if I wanted now\" — and danced in stage productions and films from the age of 7 until she gave it up at 20. As an actress, she became an instant success at 15 when she played the role of a cat opposite one of England\u0027s leading comic actors. \"The play opened, and I stole the review,\" recalls Jean with a grin. \"It was a regional theatre, and they asked me to stay in their company. It was a peak of happiness in my life. There was no time to think of money or boys or clothes or anything — just work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her Broadway debut took place more than two decades ago, and over the years she has dazzled British and American audiences in an endless number of plays and movies. Classical theatre is her specialty; Jean recently completed a tour of American regional theatres with plays by Shakespeare, Shaw and Oscar Wilde. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Regional theatres are usually more professional than Broadway. I couldn\u0027t do Twelfth Night on Broadway, but I can do it on the road and make money,\" she says of her favorite Shakespearean play. \"At one performance, I was playing in britches and split them, and I managed to make up a rhymed couplet. Somebody came backstage and said, \u0027How can you split your britches at exactly the same time every night?\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her current project is a film titled The Changeling with George C. Scott. \"I leave for Canada next week to do the exteriors. I\u0027m going to get crushed to death in the snow. I play George\u0027s wife. My role is over very quickly, but then I appear in flashback soon afterward. It\u0027s a ghost/murder mystery. My death makes him susceptible to phenomena.\" Asked about Scott, she says, \"I\u0027ve known him for about 20 years. I think he\u0027s a dear. His image seems to be spiky and alarming. People say, \u0027How can you get along with him?\u0027 But I think he\u0027s like a teddy bear. He\u0027s adorable. Rather shy, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Married and divorced at an early age, Jean now lives alone and likes it. She acquired her Eastside apartment a year ago but has been unable to spend more than six weeks in it so far, due to her extensive travel. \"I go out and get the bread and newspaper in my pajamas,\" she says. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jean explains her amazingly youthful appearance by saying, \"I\u0027m very young in my head. I\u0027m quite daft; I\u0027m sillier than most people I know. I believe in God, and I believe you should lead a good life. … One thing I\u0027m one hundred percent for is ecology. I\u0027m so anxious that we don\u0027t bequeath the next generation with an ugly world. I\u0027d like them to go on the walks I have had, and breathe the air I have breathed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Elliott. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44943.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
