{"id":1266,"no":28,"title":"EASTSIDER WILLIAM GAINES","content":"EASTSIDER WILLIAM GAINES \n Publisher and founder of Mad magazine \n \n 9-15-79 \n \n Mad magazine, an institution in American humor ever since it first appeared in 1955, is one of the few publications on the newsstand that carries no advertising. In the past few years, rising costs and changing tastes have driven Mad\u0027s circulation slightly below two million, but publisher William Gaines has no plans of giving in to commercialism. \n \n \"I was brought up on a newspaper called PM,\" recalls Gaines, an instantly likable native New Yorker who looks like a cross between Santa Claus and a middle-aged hippie. \"It sold for a nickel while everything else was two cents. Its policy was to take no ads, and I was kind of brought up on the idea that it\u0027s dirty to take advertising.\" His face breaks out in merriment, and he laughs the first of many deep, rich, belly laughs that I am to hear that afternoon. \n \n \"I don\u0027t think your publication\u0027s going to want to print that, so you\u0027d better leave it out. Um, so I, I. … I mean, it\u0027s not —\" he sputters, before quickly recovering and driving the point home with his customary journalistic finesse. \"As a matter of fact, if you\u0027re going to take ads, I think the way your people do it is the way to do it. If you\u0027re going to take ads, give the publication away. But if somebody\u0027s putting out money, it\u0027s not right. It\u0027s like going to the movies and seeing a commercial. Television, fine: you\u0027re getting it free.\" \n \n We\u0027re sitting in his somewhat disorderly Madison Avenue office, which is decorated with paintings of monsters, huge models of King Kong, and a collection of toy zeppelins suspended from the ceiling. When Gaines is asked about lawsuits, his eyes sparkle with glee. \n \n \"We have been sued many times. We\u0027ve never been beaten. We had two cases that went to the U.S. Supreme Court. The first was on Alfred E. Newman (the gap-toothed, moronic-looking character who appears on the magazine cover). Two different people claimed it was theirs — a woman by the name of Stuff and a man by the name of Schmeck. Neither one knew about the other one, and we didn\u0027t tell them. It was pretty fun when they all got to court and found that both of them were claiming to own Alfred. Through a series of decisions, the Supreme Court decided that neither one of them owned Alfred, and we were free to use him. \n \n \"The other case was when Irving Berlin and a number of other songwriters sued Mad, because we used to publish a lot of articles of song parodies which we\u0027d say were sung to the tune of so-and-so. And they took umbrage to that. They said that when people would read the words, they were singing their music in their heads. The judge ruled that Irving Berlin did not own iambic pentameter.\" \n \n The son of a prominent comic book publisher named M.C. Gaines, William planned to become a chemistry teacher when he returned to college after World War II. Then his father was killed in an accident, and Gaines decided to enter the comic business himself. \"I started putting out some very undistinguished, dreadful stuff, because I didn\u0027t know where I was going. After three years, Albert Feldstein (Mad\u0027s editor) joined me, and we just had a rapport right away. We started putting out stuff that we had a feeling for — science fiction, horror, crime.\" \n \n These comics, known as E.C. Publications, are today worth up to $200 each. Classics of their genre, they became the target of a Senate subcommittee on juvenile delinquency. Largely because of public pressure, Gaines dropped all of them except Mad, which he changed from a 10 cent comic into a 25-cent, more adult magazine. The complete E.C. works have recently been reprinted in bound volumes. \n \n A divorced father of three, Bill Gaines hates exercise, and drives the 18 blocks each day from his Eastside apartment to the Mad office. His favorite hobbies are attending wine and food tastings, and visiting Haiti. \"I\u0027ve been there about 20 times. It\u0027s a wild, untamed place. Something in my nature is appealed to by that kind of thing. … They have no maliciousness toward tourists. I was almost shot there twice, but it was by mistake.\" \n \n Things are so relaxed around the Mad headquarters that eight out of the nine full-time staffers have been with the publication for more than 20 years. \"Our writers and artists are free-lancers,\" says Gaines. \"Most of them have been with us 20 years also. … We get quite a few unsolicited manuscripts, but most of them, unfortunately, are not usable. Every once in a while we\u0027ll get one, and then we\u0027ve got a big day of rejoicing. … We\u0027re always looking for writers. We don\u0027t need artists, but you never have enough writers. And we firmly believe that the writer is God, because if you don\u0027t have a writer, you don\u0027t have movies, you don\u0027t have television, you don\u0027t have books, you don\u0027t have plays, you don\u0027t have magazines, you don\u0027t have comics — you don\u0027t have anything! \n \n \"We don\u0027t assign articles. The writers come to us with what they want to write, and as long as it\u0027s funny, we\u0027ll buy it. And we don\u0027t care what point of view, because Mad has no editorial point of view. We\u0027re not left, and we\u0027re not right. We\u0027re all mixed up. And our writers are all mixed up — in more ways than one.\" \n \n died 6-3-92. born 3-1-22. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44919.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
