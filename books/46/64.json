Kennedy into the Senate and then into the White House. He served as postmaster general under President Johnson from 1965 to 1968, and was twice named chairman of the Democratic National Committee, a post traditionally given to the party\u0027s foremost political strategist. His name loomed large in the Watergate hearings, for it was O\u0027Brien whose office was broken into by the original Watergate burglars. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was in the news again in 1974, when, having retired from politics, he published his autobiography, No Final Victories. Expecting to be out of the public eye after that, O\u0027Brien was astonished to be offered the job of commissioner of the National Basketball Association. Now midway through his fifth season, he has not only resolved the major disputes that threatened the future of professional basketball, but has brought a new vitality to the sport. \\n\\n \\n\\n The NBA\u0027s headquarters, a plush suite of office high above Fifth Avenue, is silent and practically empty on the afternoon of my appointment with the commissioner. A gregarious host, he talks about basketball and politics for nearly two hours in his effusive manner, while chain-smoking low-tar cigarettes. He is a hearty, husky man with a basso voice that rarely alters in pitch, and is as casual as a bartender. \\n\\n \\n\\n Brought up in the town where basketball was invented, the son of Irish immigrants, he worked his way through law school by tending bar in his father\u0027s cafe in the daytime and taking classes at night. One of the most trusted of politicians, known for his uncommon organizational abilities and his gift for compromise, O\u0027Brien is a fascinatingly long-winded conversationalist who speaks with many digressions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The sports commissioner is somewhat unique. First of all, you are paid by the owners, and you are expected to be as responsive as you can to the fans — to do everything possible to ensure that the game is presented in the best conceivable way to the fans, and the most exciting and interesting manner, because after all, this is business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n During the Kennedy and Johnson White House years, he served as presidential liaison to Congress and helped win passage of the Peace Corps, Medicare, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As commissioner, his authority is all-powerful. \"It goes to supervision of every aspect of the game, on and off the court,\" he explains. \"It goes to determining even what time games are played and who plays them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Attendance in the NBA has risen considerably this year; O\u0027Brien cheerfully attributes it to the resurgence of the Boston Celtics and the improvement of the New York Knicks. \\n\\n \\n\\n Recently Dallas was granted a franchise to create a new NBA team, the 23rd in the U.S. \"If there were further expansion beyond 24 teams,\" O\u0027Brien predicts, \"I think it would take on an international flavor. … There are a number of countries in Europe that are playing quality basketball at the professional level. I envision that by the mid-80s, you would find countries in Europe that could be competitive with us. Probably the first step would be only exhibitions, but I can see it reaching a point where you could give serious thought to establishing another conference perhaps.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Larry and his wife Elva have been married since 1944; their son Laurence III is a Washington-based lawyer. An Eastside resident during most of the last seven years, O\u0027Brien recalls the Watergate break-in with grim humor. \"We didn\u0027t have anything in the office anyway. We were practically bankrupt. I thought, maybe there\u0027s a typewriter missing. … I was a disbeliever. It took a long time for it to penetrate that this was real. … My best recollection of that period is that I was very depressed, in the sense of what effects it was having on our system of government. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When I was on my book promotion tour, people would ask, \u0027How does it feel to be a politician?\u0027 as if it was a dirty word. I have always been proud of being a politician, and I\u0027ve never felt otherwise. But I found that all of us involved in politics were painted with the same brush.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His mood brightens when the subject returns to basketball. Speaking of the recent backboard-shattering antics of \"Chocolate Thunder\" Darryl Dawkins, O\u0027Brien reports that the star \"said that he certainly could adjust his dunk shot to prevent further incidents.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The most difficult aspect of his job so far, says O\u0027Brien, has been to enforce the compensation agreement that players and owners signed four years ago. \"Compensation means that when a player has terminated his contractual obligations to a club, the new club that acquires him must make compensation to the other team, and work that out between them. And then if the two teams fail to reach an agreement, the case comes to me and I determine what compensation is appropriate. In making the losing club whole, I can assign draft choices, players, money, or any combination thereof. It\u0027s extremely difficult — weighing players against players, and deciding how much money is valid compensation. There\u0027s no sure way of doing it, unless you were Solomon or you had a crystal ball as to how it would turn out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44989.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
