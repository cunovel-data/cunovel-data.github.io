{"id":1273,"no":35,"title":"WESTSIDER LIONEL HAMPTON","content":"WESTSIDER LIONEL HAMPTON King of the Newport Jazz Festival 6-24-78 The world\u0027s greatest celebration of jazz, the Newport Jazz Festival, will get off the ground on June 23 — its 25th consecutive year. During the 12 day festival, in indoor and outdoor settings all over Manhattan and beyond, the most important names in jazz will stage nearly 30 major musical events. More than half the concerts, appropriately enough, will take place on the West Side, in Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall. And just as appropriately, this year\u0027s festival will be dedicated to a Westsider whose life has been an inspiration to millions of people, not only for the great music he has created, but for a heart as large as the Grand Canyon. To call him merely a giant of jazz could be an understatement, because they don\u0027t come any bigger than Lionel Hampton. Ask a dozen people what the name Lionel Hampton means to them and you\u0027re likely to get a dozen answers — all of them correct. In his 50 years as a professional musician, \"Hamp\" has used his remarkable gifts humbly, wisely, and unselfishly. Music historians will always remember him as the man who introduced the vibraphone into jazz. This he accomplished in 1930, while playing with Louis Armstrong. Ever since, Hampton has been known as the world\u0027s foremost master of the instrument. He is also a leading drummer, pianist, singer, arranger, bandleader and composer. At 69, he continues to work nearly 50 weeks out of the year, taking his band to every corner of the U.S. and Europe. But whether he\u0027s making a live recording in a nightclub or performing his own symphonic works with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Lionel Hampton glows with a spiritual energy that extends far beyond his music. It\u0027s 2 o\u0027clock in the afternoon when I arrive at Hampton\u0027s neat, modern apartment overlooking Lincoln Center. I sit on the sofa talking with Chuck Jones, his public relations man, and a few minutes later Hampton emerges from the bedroom and plops down on the sofa beside me, wearing a dressing gown, slippers, and the famous smile that no one can imitate. After the introductions, I ask about his most recent concerts. \"I\u0027m still trying to get myself together,\" he says almost apologetically in his rich Southern drawl. \"We just got back from a six-week tour in Europe. We played all over Scandinavia, Germany, Southern France. \"When I was in Chicago this week, at the Playboy Cub, they gave me a new set of drums, with lights inside. I push a button and the whole drum lights up. I\u0027m going to use them for Newport. This is the latest thing. It will blow their minds. We open on July first in Carnegie Hall and I\u0027m bringing back a lot of veterans from my band.\" He grew up in Chicago, but because of the gang fights in his neighborhood, Lionel\u0027s grandmother sent him to a Catholic school in Wisconsin. There a nun taught him to play the drums. The youngster learned fast; when he was 15, he made up his mind to head for the West Coast on his own, to pursue a jazz career. At the train station, he promised his grandmother that he would say his prayers and read the Bible every day. Some 15 years later, Hampton was invited to join the Benny Goodman band in New York. His acceptance of the offer had great social significance, for it was the first time that blacks and whites played together in a major musical group. \u003eFrom 1937 to 1971 he lived in central Harlem. Then, after moving to the West Side, Hampton decided that he wanted to help upgrade his old neighborhood, so, on the advice of Governor Nelson Rockefeller, he raised $1 million in seed money and filed an application with the Urban Development Corporation for some new housing. Today there are 355 families living in the Lionel Hampton Houses at 130th Street and 8th Avenue.\" I was just designated the land right next to it,\" he says proudly. \"We\u0027re going to break ground next year. It will be 250 family units, dedicated to my late wife Gladys. The Gladys Hampton Building.\" A friend of many important public figures, Hampton has never lost his affection for Richard Nixon: \"When I was a kid in California, President Nixon was our congressman. Then he became our senator. He was a good man and a good politician. He helped the blacks a lot; he helped the Spanish. I campaigned for him when he ran for president. … What happened with Watergate, I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s high politics. But I know I always had high esteem for him.\" In a political campaign last year, Hampton threw his support behind Ernest Morial, a black man who was running for mayor of New Orleans. Before Hampton stepped in, Morial was sixth in the polls. \"I sent my P.R. man Chuck Jones down there to put some life into his campaign. Chuck put a thousand placards all over town and went on all the radio stations, and I played at a Morial for Mayor music festival. He came in first in the primary and then he won the election.\" My questions are finished. I get up and shake Lionel\u0027s hand, telling him that I\u0027ve always loved his music. He dashes into his bedroom, bringing out four records for me to take home. He shakes my hand twice more. On my way to the door, I ask him one last question: Does he still have time to read the Bible every day? \"Yes,\" he replies, grinning, \"That\u0027s what I was doing when you came here and that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do after you leave.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44926.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
