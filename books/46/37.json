{"id":1275,"no":37,"title":"EASTSIDER WALTER HOVING","content":"EASTSIDER WALTER HOVING Chairman of Tiffany \u0026 Company 12-22-79 When Walter Hoving took over as chairman of Tiffany and Company in 1955, he gave his designers one simple rule: \"Design what you think is beautiful and don\u0027t worry about selling it.\" The rule applies as much to store\u0027s eye-catching Christmas display windows as to the three floors of jewelry, silver, china, and crystal at the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street. Hoving\u0027s unique combination of business wizardry and impeccable taste has paid off dramatically: since he joined the company, Tiffany\u0027s annual sales haver gone from $7 million to $73 million. A tall, soft-spoken, former Brown University football star whose unlined forehead and vigorous appearance belie his 82 years, Hoving has a voice like Jimmy Stewart\u0027s and kindly yet authoritative manner. On his conservative gray suit is a tiny silver pin with the words \"Try God.\" Leaning back in the comfortable desk chair at his vast, teakwood-paneled office at Tiffany\u0027s on a recent afternoon, he answers all questions thoroughly and unhesitatingly. \"We don\u0027t think in terms of price at all. Whatever we sell has got to be up to our standard in quality material, quality workmanship, and quality of design. … You see, you\u0027ve got to have a point of view in this thing. That\u0027s all we\u0027ve got is a point of view, and we stick to it.\" What he calls a \"point of view\" others would simply define as \"taste.\" And Hoving is well qualified to have strong opinions in this area. At the age of 30, three years after joining R.H. Macy and Company, he was already a vice president and merchandising director. At that point, says Hoving, \"I realized that design was going to be a coming thing, and I really didn\u0027t know much about it. So I matriculated at New York University in their arts department, and I took courses on period furniture, old silver, historic textiles, color and design. It took me three years, twice a week at night. … Then, of course, I could learn by going into people\u0027s homes that were beautiful, in England and France, at museums — wherever I was. You learn if you have a basis. And so I advise anybody who comes into this business to get knowledgeable about decorative arts.\" After leaving Macy\u0027s, he climbed steadily, becoming vice president of Montgomery Ward, president of Lord \u0026 Taylor, and president of Bonwit Teller. Upon arriving at Tiffany\u0027s, one of the first things he did was to discontinue selling anything that didn\u0027t conform to his esthetic standards, regardless of profit. The current 180-page catalogue lists almost 100 items under $25, along with such unabashed luxuries as a porcelain dessert service for six priced at $4,200 and an unpriced \"seashell\" necklace of 18-carat gold with diamonds set in platinum. Tiffany\u0027s carries no synthetic gems because, according to Hoving, \"everything here is real,\" and no men\u0027s diamond rings because \"we think they\u0027re vulgar.\" He adds: \"I dropped antique silver. I saw no reason why Tiffany should carry it. You can get antiques anyplace. Our job is to make antiques for the future.\" Since 1963, Tiffany has opened branch stores in five other cities. Several floors in the Fifth Avenue headquarters house artists, engravers, clockmakers and jewelry craftsmen. There is also a Tiffany factory in New Jersey. The author of two best-selling books, Your Career in Business and Tiffany\u0027s Table Manners for Teenagers, Hoving is a deeply religious man who has long been actively involved in charitable work. He is a co founder of the Salvation Army Association of New York, and gives his time to the United Negro College Fund, the United Service Organizations, and, most recently, a home for heroin-addicted girls in Garrison, New York, which has been named in his honor. When a friend at St. Bartholomew\u0027s Church asked Hoving to make her a pin reading \"Try God,\" he got the idea of selling the pin at Tiffany\u0027s and giving the proceeds to the Walter Hoving Home. So far, 600,000 have been sold. Jane Pickens Hoving, his wife since 1977, is the founder and chairman of an organization known as Tune in New York, which matches volunteers to jobs best suited for their talents and interests. It is about to open a headquarters at 730 Fifth Avenue, across from Tiffany\u0027s. His son Thomas Hoving served as commissioner of parks for New York City and for many years was director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He recently wrote a book on Tutankhamen and has another book in the works. An Eastsider for over 50 years, Walter Hoving walks more than three miles a day between his home and office. He frequently mixes with customers in the store, and one of his favorite anecdotes is about the time he spoke with a woman who was registering her daughter for wedding presents. \"The woman said that she and her husband wanted everything to come from Tiffany\u0027s because they were sure if it was from Tiffany\u0027s it would be all right,\" relates Hoving. \"I said, \u0027What does your husband do?\u0027 She said, \u0027He is a letter carrier.\u0027 Well, I felt better than if I had sold Mrs. Astorbilt a million-dollar diamond ring.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44928.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
