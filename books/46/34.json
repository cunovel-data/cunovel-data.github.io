{"id":1272,"no":34,"title":"WESTSIDER DELORES HALL","content":"WESTSIDER DELORES HALL Star of Your Arms Too Short to Box with God 5-21-77 It\u0027s just after 10 on a Wednesday evening when Delores Hall steps out of the Lyceum Theatre\u0027s stage door onto 46th Street. At least 20 fans are waiting; they give a cheer as she emerges and rush toward her. Delores Hall smiles broadly as she autographs their programs, for these fans are hers. She has worked hard to become a Broadway star, and now in Your Arms Too Short to Box with God she is precisely that. \"No, I\u0027m not really tired,\" says Ms. Hall a few minutes later over a snack at the All-State Cafe. \"I\u0027m still at a peak of energy from the show. That was my second performance today, but I could do another one if I had to.\" Asking Delores about her earlier days brings a flood of memories and laughter. She\u0027s a happy, bouncy woman and seems as pleased to talk as any friendly neighbor. \"When I was 3 I discovered I had vibrato,\" she recalls. \"My mother taught me everything I know about singing. I can remember her hitting me in the stomach, showing me how to breathe. But whatever she did, she did it right. I was 4 when I first sang in public; they stood me on a table. I can remember some people throwing 50-cent pieces.\" Born in Kansas City slightly more than 30 years ago, Delores grew up with music in her ears. Her father played the bass for Count Basie, and her mother was — and still is — a missionary in the Church of God in Christ, which produces gospel singers the way southern universities raise football players. Young Delores began singing regularly at the church services — an activity she continued when her family moved to Los Angeles. When Delores entered college she formed her own gospel group, an act so popular that she soon left school to become a full-time musician. Later, Harry Belafonte invited the Delores Hall Singers to tour with him for six months. \"Harry is a beautiful man,\" Delores grins. \"He came to the show a month or so ago, and afterwards he went backstage and somebody introduced us. He said, \u0027Miss Hall, I\u0027ve heard so much about you,\u0027 and then he screamed, and we jumped into each other\u0027s arms. Delores has lived in New York since 1969. Five years ago she moved to the West Side. \"People are so much warmer here,\" she says. Her remarkable singing has won her parts in half a dozen Broadway shows, but with Box, for the first time, she suddenly found herself the star of a hit production. Clive Barnes, in a highly positive review in the New York Times, declares: \"Miss Hall has the audience in the palm of her voice.\" The all-black cast of this musical adaptation of the Book of Matthew has been packing the Lyceum since Christmas, and advance ticket sales go to October. In spite of Ms. Hall\u0027s unbroken musical success, her life has not been without personal tragedy. Just before the Broadway premiere of Box last December 22, she suffered the heartbreaking loss of her only brother, a minister. \"It was very hard to open the show,\" she recalls, \"but I got through it with the help of God.\" Delores lives on West 72nd Street with her husband of seven years, Michael Goodstone. Whenever she can, Delores joins Michael at temple in Westchester County: \"I find it very uplifting spiritually, because I believe God is everywhere.\" Each Sunday the couple both attend the Church of God in Christ. \"Some people call it the Holy Roller church,\" she explains. \"After the service, we go downstairs for a piece of the best fried chicken.\" Ms. Hall\u0027s face glows with pride when she speaks of Deardra, her 14 year-old daughter from a previous marriage: \"My daughter is a singer, too. She won the music award from her school.\" Deardra is hoping to enter New York\u0027s High School of Performing Arts this fall. Plans for the future? Delores would like to try grand opera someday — possibly the role of Aida. And a new record album is not far off. Several years ago she recorded her first album for RCA. Since she began drawing national attention in Box, some tempting offers have come in from recording companies, and her manager is in the process of negotiating a contract. The new album may be either gospel or middle of the road: \"I\u0027m praying very hard, so it depends on what the Lord says.\" But for the moment, Delores Hall is well satisfied at filling the Lyceum Theatre seven times each week. \"This show I love so much,\" she says, her eyes sparkling, \"because it takes me home.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44925.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
