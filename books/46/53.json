{"id":1291,"no":53,"title":"EASTSIDER JACKIE MASON","content":"EASTSIDER JACKIE MASON \\n\\n Co-starring with Steve Martin in The Jerk \\n\\n \\n\\n 12-8-79 \\n\\n \\n\\n Jackie Mason admits that the most famous thing he ever did was to be caught with one of his fingers pointing upwards on the Ed Sullivan Show. \"The most famous and the least helpful,\" he says of the 1964 incident. \"At that time there was a great wave of excitement about my type of character, because I was new and fresh and different. In those days, every comedian talked like an American; nobody talked like a Jew or a Puerto Rican or an Italian. … There was a lot of heat to give me my own series, but all the offers were canceled after that incident.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Asked whether he actually did make an obscene gesture, the short, stocky comedian with the broad New York Jewish accent shakes his curly head. \"The truth is that I didn\u0027t — because I wouldn\u0027t be ashamed to tell you if I did. There\u0027s nothing wrong with it today. But the truth is that I was making with my fingers — I have a very visual act, you know — and Sullivan got panicky because President Johnson had just cut into the program, and when the camera came back on me, it looked like I was giving him some kind of message. The next day, I became headlines all over the world. … I maintained enough success and enough imagery to be able to do all the other shows as a guest, but the sponsors were afraid to be associated with me as the star.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jackie is telling me this in his dressing room at Dangerfield\u0027s (1118 First Avenue), where he\u0027s performing six nights a week until December 17. The affable Mason is quick to defend his caustic brand of ethnic humor. \"I don\u0027t see how it can be harmful. If people do feel any prejudice, it provides an outlet for them to be able to laugh at it. The people who decry ethnic humor are afraid of their own prejudice. You remind them of the ridiculous nature of prejudice. … Most of the things I say are universal: they\u0027re about marriage, about minorities, about social problems — the issues of the day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He also pokes fun at doctors, weathermen and every profession in between. Then there are his highly exaggerated impressions of Menachem Begin, Jimmy Carter and Ed Sullivan (\"He always asked me to do an impression of him on his show. He found out from me how to do him.\"). Another of his ploys is to razz the audience members. \"In 21 years,\" he said, \"I only had one incident where a guy got mad and wanted to punch me in the mouth. Thank God I move very fast. He wanted to kill me. Obviously he didn\u0027t catch me. That\u0027s why I\u0027m still here for the interview.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, he was raised in New York\u0027s Lower East Side from the age of 5. Following in the footsteps of three older brothers, he studied to become a rabbi to please his father. \"I knew it wasn\u0027t for me. I have all license to be a rabbi, but I\u0027m not a rabbi.\" A bachelor and Eastside resident, he loves New York because \"this is a melting pot that doesn\u0027t really melt. There\u0027s a pot, but it\u0027s full of unmelted people.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dangerfield\u0027s, he says, is the only club in New York where major comedians still perform. \"Seven, eight, nine years ago, there was about 12 clubs that played comedians. There was the Copacabana, the Waldorf Astoria, the Latin Quarter, the Plaza: all those rooms were wiped out.\" Consequently, Jackie does a lot of performing in such clubs as the Riviera in Las Vegas and the Fontainebleau in Miami. Nowadays, however, he\u0027s more interested in making movies. His first one, directed by John Avelson of Rocky fame, was \"a big success without anybody seeing it.\" His second film, The Jerk, is now being heavily promoted for its December 14 opening. Also starring Steve Martin, Bernadette Peters and Catlin Adams, it is about a poor black sharecropper\u0027s adopted son (Martin) who leaves home and begins wandering on the road until he ends up at the gas station of Harry Hartounian, played by Mason. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s an uneducated kid who doesn\u0027t know anything,\" explains Jackie. \"He doesn\u0027t know how to handle himself, how to talk, how to act. I give him a part-time job at my place, and I give him a room. He doesn\u0027t know what a job is, and he doesn\u0027t understand that you get paid. He never saw money. He thinks you\u0027re supposed to eat it. He\u0027s a crazy lost kid and I play the father figure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n On December 20, Jackie will appear on the Merv Griffin Show with \\n\\n Steve Martin and Carl Reiner, the movie\u0027s director. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jackie loves being a comedian because \"I\u0027m my own boss and I do what I like … When young comics say it\u0027s a hard business to enter, it\u0027s because they have no talent. If a young comic has talent, he\u0027s more likely to make a big living than in any business you can think of, with comparatively less effort, and more opportunity, and greater longevity. I never saw a good comedian in this business who hasn\u0027t made a comfortable living at it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44978.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
