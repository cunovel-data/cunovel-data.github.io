Then his career took an abrupt turn: in June 1970 he was offered a job at WABC-TV\u0027s Eyewitness News, and Rivera quickly accepted. His aggressive, probing style, matchless reportorial skills, and charismatic presence gained him the Associated Press\u0027 first-place citation as top newsman of 1971 — an award he received three more times in the next four years. \\n\\n \\n\\n In 1975 he became the traveling co-host of Good Morning America on ABC network; in the 20 months that followed, his assignments took him to more than two dozen countries. Continuing his upward climb, he was next transferred to the ABC Evening News with Barbara Walters and Harry Reasoner. Finally in 1978, he was named to his present position — as special correspondent for 20/20, ABC\u0027s weekly hour-long news magazine show. \\n\\n \\n\\n Over the past nine years, Rivera\u0027s special reports have earned him virtually all the major awards in broadcast journalism, including several Emmys. It was one of his earliest documentaries, however, that brought him the most recognition. Titled Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace, the 1972 expose focused on the conditions at Staten Island\u0027s Willowbrook institution for the mentally retarded. The broadcast resulted in an unprecedented response from viewers. So many offers of assistance poured in that Rivera was able to set up a national organization known as One to One, whose goal is to give ongoing, individualized attention to retarded persons. Since 1973, One to One has raised more than $2 million, and helped to build almost 60 group homes throughout the New York metropolitan area, each housing approximately 12 retarded persons of the same general age range. \\n\\n \\n\\n On June 6 from 8 to 10:30 p.m., One to One will present a TV special that will combine top entertainment with personal accounts of retarded people, their parents, and the role of the media in helping to shape public awareness. The entertainers include Paul McCartney and Wings, Neil Sedaka, Debby Boone, Ed Asner, Angela Lansbury and the Captain \u0026 Tennille. Geraldo Rivera shares the emceeing chores with his ABC colleague John Johnson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The show will be both taped and live,\" says Rivera in an interview at his West 60th Street office. \"We\u0027ve designed the program so that it\u0027s not a classic telethon where every two seconds they say, \u0027Please send us your money.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Among the more dramatic moments is a tape of the Seventh Annual Wall Street Charity Fund Boxing Match, which raised thousands of dollars for One to One. \"For the first year, I\u0027m not the main event,\" comments Rivera, who scored a technical knockout over his opponent in 1978. \"My nose was broken last year, and they took out all the scar tissue. They decided that my nose had given enough for the cause.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He learned most of his boxing \"just street fighting growing up.\" Born 35 years ago on the Lower East Side to a Puerto Rican father and a Jewish mother, he was christened Gerald Rivers and hispanicized his name while in college. There are no scars on his ruggedly handsome face. With his neatly styled hair, easy smile, and air of casual masculinity — one of his favorite outfits is a denim jacket over a T-shirt — Rivera could easily pass for a professional athlete turned matinee idol. Yet it is primarily his literary ability, combined with a sentimentality backed up by facts, that has made him a type of media folk hero. His documentaries have earned him 78 humanitarian awards. \\n\\n \\n\\n In addition to his more than 3,000 news stories, Rivera has written four books, including one on Willowbrook. \"I\u0027ve been back there many times, and it still stinks — literally and figuratively,\" says Rivera in his customary vibrant tone. \"But it\u0027s now a much smaller place. Willowbrook started with 6,500 people, and now it\u0027s well under a thousand. It has become, in fact, one of the better institutions. But institutions are not the answer. There\u0027s no such thing as a good big institution.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With his commitments as chairman of One to One, his heav","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45001.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
