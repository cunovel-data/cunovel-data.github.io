{"id":1308,"no":70,"title":"WESTSIDER CHARLES RANGEL","content":"WESTSIDER CHARLES RANGEL \\n\\n Congressman of the 19th District \\n\\n \\n\\n 8-26-78 \\n\\n \\n\\n The dividing line of New York\u0027s 19th Congressional District twists and loops through upper Manhattan like a traveler who has lost his way. From the corner of 62nd Street and Central Park West, the boundary turns sharply at Amsterdam Avenue and extends northward to 164th Street, then follows the East River shoreline south to Roosevelt Island, taking in all of Harlem and a large chunk of the East Side. \\n\\n \\n\\n This is the area that U.S. Congressman Charles Rangel has represented ever since he was sent to Washington in 1971, after defeating the colorful and controversial Adam Clayton Powell Jr. in the Democratic primary. Today, as firmly in control of the seat as Powell was during his height of popularity, Congressman Rangel stands virtually unopposed in his quest for a fifth term. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have received the Democratic endorsement, the Republican endorsement, and the Liberal endorsement,\" says Rangel one Friday afternoon at the towering State Office Building on 125th Street. \"I am assuming that the Socialist Workers Party and the Communist Party will be filing. They normally do. In the last election I got 96.4 percent of the vote.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereas the late Powell had wide appeal only among the city\u0027s blacks, Rangel gained the support of many Harlem residents plus a large majority of liberal whites on the upper West Side. It was they who provided him with a 150-vote margin of victory over Powell in 1970. In the present 95th Congress, Rangel has had the most liberal voting record of any congressman from New York state. And while he has continued to give a great deal of attention to Harlem\u0027s problems of health care, unemployment and drugs, Rangel has recently had more demands placed on his time as a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. The first black ever to serve on the committee, he is currently 11th in seniority and will be seventh in the next Congress. \\n\\n \\n\\n In his New York office, where he generally spends two days per week, Rangel appears surprisingly fresh and relaxed at the end of a working day. As we settle into the interview, the elegantly dressed congressman with the graying moustache and the rasping voice proves himself very much the politician. He uses each question as a springboard to launch into his favorite topics — for example, his access to President Carter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Because of his various committee assignments and his strong support of most of Carter\u0027s policies, says Rangel, \"I am forced to meet with the president more than probably many other members of Congress. I often stop by the White House on my way to the office.\" Rangel also likes to talk about Chip Carter, the president\u0027s son, who is involved in a project called City in Schools, designed to upgrade the neighborhoods outside certain schools. Chip has taken a special interest in Harlem, and one school in particular near Morningside Park. \"I am confident that with Chip Carter\u0027s help, and with my help, Morningside Park will soon show some improvements. I hope that Columbia University will assist us too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When asked about the unusual shape of the 19th Congressional District, Rangel says, \"The reason for it is that as we find populations expanding, we don\u0027t find the size or the numbers of the members of Congress expanding. We used to have half a dozen members of Congress representing different parts of Manhattan. Now we\u0027re down to three — me, Green, and Weiss. If you break it down, you can see that Adam Clayton Powell\u0027s district used to be just Harlem.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As a member of the House select Committee on Narcotics and Drugs, says Rangel, \"I have gone to Moscow, to try to encourage them to do more in the area of controlling opium. I have been to Thailand for the same reason. … That\u0027s one area in which I have great disappointment in this administration. I find efforts of Nixon\u0027s to be greater than Carter\u0027s. The Office of Drug Abuse was disbanded by Carter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Another field in which he finds Carter at fault is health care. \"I support Kennedy\u0027s proposal,\" said the congressman. \"There\u0027s no question that, for anti-inflation reasons, the president has put his national health program on the back burner. But to think that any program could be directly controlled by economic needs rather than by the medical needs of the people is something I cannot accept.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The ultraliberal Rangel, one of the most vociferous supporters of U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young, still lives in the same building where he was born 48 years ago, whenever he\u0027s not in Washington. He dropped out of high school to enlist in the Army and spent four years compiling a distinguished service record, including a presidential citation and three battle stars. Once he returned to New York, Rangel completed high school, went to college, and entered law school on a full scholarship. He was admitted to the bar in 1960; in 1966 he was elected to the first of two terms in the New York State Assembly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Married and with two children, Congressman Rangel believes that his future lies primarily in the Ways and Means Committee, which handles such giant concerns as taxes, trade, health insurance, social security and welfare. In order to maintain his popularity throughout the 19th Congressional District, he must continue to support those programs that benefit his constituents in both Harlem and the Upper West Side. How can this be done? \"If we\u0027re going to use the tax system to make incentives for the business community to help the economy,\" he replies, \"we need to bring the disadvantaged into the mainstream.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44995.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
