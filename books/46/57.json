{"id":1295,"no":57,"title":"WESTSIDER SHERRILL MILNES","content":"WESTSIDER SHERRILL MILNES \n Opera superstar \n \n 2-24-79 \n \n \"In a career of my size,\" says baritone Sherrill Milnes, \"there is no off season. I try to hold myself to 60 performances a year — not including recordings or dress rehearsals or private studies. … In fact, I think I\u0027m the most-recorded American opera singer ever, in any voice category.\" \n \n We\u0027re talking in his spacious Westside apartment facing the Hudson River. I cannot help observing that Milnes, a handsome man who stands 6 foot 2 and weighs 220 pounds, with his dark hair combed straight back and wearing a blue flowered shirt, looks very much like a country and western singer. It is his chest that gives him away — a massive, powerful chest that hints at the huge voice it supports. To deliver notes that are clearly audible throughout the largest opera houses in the world, over the sound of a full orchestra, and without amplification, is one of the most physically demanding tasks in all the performing arts. And one of the best paying. Only a handful of singers take home, like Milnes, approximately $7,000 for each night\u0027s work. \n \n At 44, he is in the peak of his career, and has been since he made his Metropolitan Opera debut in December, 1965. He has sung in virtually all of the world\u0027s leading opera houses, including the Paris Opera, the Hamburg State Opera, and La Scala in Milan. Asked what more he can accomplish, Milnes replies that \"one hopes to become a better artist all the time. But you can only go so fast. If you make family a priority position — which is certainly true in this case — there are only so many hours in the day. I could be more famous, were I on television more. But it takes time. … I don\u0027t want to sound like: he\u0027s satisfied with his career, where he is, and he doesn\u0027t want to do any more. But I have to realize that my career can no longer continue at the same rate of ascendancy.\" \n \n His current show with the Met, Verdi\u0027s Don Carlo, will continue until mid-March. \"This is the first time New York has heard the five-act original version,\" notes Milnes. \"We\u0027ll be doing it in Italian. People said, \u0027Why don\u0027t you do Don Carlo like the real original, in French?\u0027 The problem is, five years later, where do you find people who know it in French? There\u0027s a practical set of problems when, worldwide, everybody know it in Italian. I don\u0027t know if it would have been worth it for one season.\" Long-range planning is an important aspect of any opera singer\u0027s life. Milnes already has his schedule set up until 1984. \n \n The main reason why Italy has declined in importance as a center for opera, says Milnes, is that the country\u0027s economic problems make it impossible for the companies to book singers years in advance. \"I think America is now producing more singers than Italy, and Spain is very high on the list of producing singers.\" \n \n It is to Italy that Milnes owes much of his success. \"We have that phrase \u0027Verdi baritone\u0027 — sometimes more generically, \u0027Italian baritone.\u0027 There\u0027s no question that Verdi treated the baritone as a special voice category, differently really than composers before him. He did a lot of title roles for the baritone voice, and really split the bass and baritone roles very much.\" \n \n Widely known as an unselfish performer who gives his time freely to others, Milnes is chairman of the board of Affiliated Artists, a non-profit organization that arranges concerts across America for young, up-and coming singers. \n \n Born on an Illinois farm, he studied piano and violin from early childhood. In high school, he won the state music contest in five separate categories, including vocal soloist. Deciding that his voice was the instrument that showed most promise, he began his professional career as a member of a chorus attached to the Chicago Symphony. In 1960 he turned to opera. Boris Goldovsky, the opera maestro, signed him immediately, taught his willing pupil the fine points of acting in opera, and took him on five cross-country tours. Since 1962, Milnes has had practically no time for anything but singing. \n \n A dedicated family man, he is married to soprano Nancy Stokes. The couple has a 6-year-old son, Shawn, and Milnes has two other children from a previous marriage. He has been a Westsider for almost 10 years. \n \n Not at all snobbish about his own musical gifts, Milnes believes that singing is excellent recreation for anyone, regardless of voice quality. \"I encourage people to sing in the shower. It\u0027s a great emotional outlet. Even if you\u0027re lousy, it makes you sound fantastic. When I\u0027m on the stage, I always have that feeling that I\u0027m never going to sound as good as I do in the shower. You can\u0027t get the same ring when you\u0027re singing to 5,000 people.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44982.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
