{"id":1307,"no":69,"title":"EASTSIDER OTTO PREMINGER","content":"EASTSIDER OTTO PREMINGER Rebel filmmaker returns with The Human Factor 1-26-80 On the cover of his 1977 autobiography Preminger, he is described as \"Hollywood\u0027s most tempestuous director\" and \"the screen\u0027s stormiest rebel.\" But today, at 73, the years appear to have caught up with Otto Preminger, the Austrian-born director and actor who came to the U.S. in 1935 and met success after success, both in movies and on Broadway. He became the first producer/director to make major motion pictures independently of the giant studios, and with such films as Forever Amber, The Moon is Blue and The Man with the Golden Arm, won precedent-settling battles with censorship boards that established new artistic freedom for filmmakers. Between 1959 and 1963 he produced and directed, in succession, Porgy and Bess, Anatomy of a Murder, Exodus, Advice and Consent, and The Cardinal. After that his career took a dip, and since 1971 he has released but a single movie, Rosebud (1975), which marked the screenwriting debut of his son Erik Lee Preminger and the acting debut of a New Yorker named John Lindsay, the city\u0027s former mayor. In February, Preminger\u0027s 33rd film, The Human Factor, is scheduled to open in New York and across the country. Based on a best-selling novel by Graham Greene, The Human Factor is the suspenseful story of a black South African woman (played by fashion model Iman) who marries a white secret agent (Nicol Williamson). Filmed mainly in the English countryside, the movie deals with the agent\u0027s allegiance to the man who helps his wife to escape from South Africa. Persuaded to become a double agent, he ends up in Moscow, separated from the one person he loves. The novel\u0027s title underlines the fact that bureaucracy can never be all-powerful: there is always the human factor. Preminger, seated at his huge palette-shaped desk of white marble in the lavishly furnished projection room on the uppermost floor of his Eastside town house, admits that he sank over $2 million of his own money into the picture when his signed backers failed to come through. \"Everybody in Europe lies about money,\" says Preminger in his deep, German accented voice. \"I originally wanted to sue them, but suing doesn\u0027t make sense unless you are sure they have money. So I inquired from my Swiss lawyer, and they didn\u0027t have money in Switzerland. You see, in Switzerland, the advantage of the Swiss law is that is you sue somebody, all his assets are frozen immediately. … Luckily enough, I had two houses that I wanted to sell in the south of France. … At least I own the whole film. The question is now only: Will the picture be a big success as I hope, or not? That is always the main thing.\" The nattily dressed Preminger, a tall, large man whose distinguished features and totally bald head give the opposite impression of his slow movement and somewhat frail appearance, revealed that the film\u0027s African scenes had to be shot in Kenya rather than South Africa \"because they said they must see what I am shooting, and if they don\u0027t like it, they will confiscate it. They said, \u0027People in bed you can\u0027t shoot.\u0027 Then I went to Kenya, where there is a black government, and they didn\u0027t even ask for the script. They said I could have anything I want.\" Asked whether any memorable events took place during the filming, Preminger snaps, \"Even if there were, I don\u0027t remember. After I have made a picture and I have seen it maybe two, three times with an audience, I deliberately detach myself, because I don\u0027t want it to influence my next picture. As a matter of fact, a few months ago, my wife was dressing to go out, and I turned on the television and saw one of my old pictures. I recognized it, but we had to leave before it was finished. I still don\u0027t know how it ends.\" As for Preminger\u0027s love life, he writes in his autobiography: \"I have a reputation with women which is not entirely deserved, though it is true that I had my share of them, some of them stars.\" In 1944 he had a three-week love affair with Gypsy Rose Lee that resulted in the birth of his son Erik Lee Preminger. The boy didn\u0027t find out the identity of his real father until the age of 18. They were reunited four years later, and liked each other immediately. Preminger legally adopted Erik, who is currently in Los Angeles writing a biography of his late mother. Preminger and his third wife, a former costume designer named Hope Bryce, to whom he has been married since 1959, are the parents of 19 year-old twins, Victoria and Mark. An Upper Eastsider for two decades, Preminger includes among his favorite restaurants Caravelle, Le Cirque and 21, where agent Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar once broke a glass over his head that took 51 stitches to close. An unabashed admirer of luxury, Preminger remains unruffled when questioned about how his fancy Eastside pad is in line with the philosophy stated in his autobiography that \"my real reward is my work itself. Success matters only because without it, one cannot continue to work.\" \"I could live without it,\" he says with a shrug. \"I like to give my family luxuries, but I could easily live in one furnished room and be also happy.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44994.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
