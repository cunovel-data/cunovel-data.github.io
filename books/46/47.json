{"id":1285,"no":47,"title":"EASTSIDER STAN LEE","content":"EASTSIDER STAN LEE \\n\\n Creator of Spiderman and the Incredible Hulk \\n\\n \\n\\n 1-13-79 \\n\\n \\n\\n With the current rage over Superman due to last year\u0027s hit movie, many people will purchase a copy of the comic for the first time in years, and may be disappointed to see how much it has changed. Once the largest selling comic book hero on the market, Superman was knocked out of first place long ago by Spiderman, the creation of a 56-year-old native New Yorker named Stan Lee. Besides selling about one million Marvel comics each month, Spiderman appears as a daily strip in some 500 newspapers around the world. \\n\\n \\n\\n But even without this giant success, Stan Lee would be rich and famous. His fertile mind has also given birth to the Incredible Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Captain America, Doctor Strange, and a host of other modern-day mythological figures. As publisher of Marvel Comics, he rules over an empire that branches out into dozens of areas — prime-time television drama, animated cartoons, hardbound and paperback collections of comic reprints, novels about Marvel characters, toys, games, posters, clothing and much more. Most of these spin-off products are the work of other companies that have bought the rights, but Stan Lee remains the creative force behind the whole operation, as I discover during a meeting with Lee at the Marvel headquarters on Madison Avenue. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think the title of publisher is just given to me so I can have more prestige when I\u0027m dealing with people,\" says Lee in his clipped, precise voice, as he stretches his feet onto the coffee table of his brightly decorated office. \"I\u0027m a salaried employee of Marvel — your average humble little guy trying to stay afloat in the stormy sea of culture. The company owns the properties, of course, but I have no complaints. I don\u0027t think I could have as much anywhere else. … My main interest is to see that the company itself does well and makes as much money as possible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He is an intense, energetic man of wiry build who dresses in a casual yet elegant manner. As he shifts the position of his arms and legs on the couch, there is something unmistakably spiderlike in the movements. For all his politeness, he cannot mask the impression that his mind is racing far ahead of his rapidly spoken words. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My involvement with this company goes back to about 1939,\" says Lee. \"I was always the editor, the art director, the head writer, and the creative director [from the age of 17]. In the early 1960s I was thinking of quitting. I thought I wasn\u0027t really getting anywhere. My wife said, \u0027Why not give it one last fling and do the kind of stories you want to do?\u0027 So I started bringing out the offbeat heroes. I never dreamt that they would catch on the way they did.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He emphasizes that he did not create the characters alone, but co-created them with the help of an artist. Nevertheless, it was Lee who revolutionized the comic book industry by introducing the concept of what has been termed the \"hung-up hero\" — the superhero whose powers do not preclude him from having the same emotional troubles as the average mortal. This is what makes Lee\u0027s characters so believable and so irresistibly entertaining on television. It explains why CBS\u0027 The Incredible Hulk is a hit, and why the same network has filmed eight episodes of The Amazing Spiderman. On January 19 from 8 to 10 p.m., CBS will broadcast the pilot for a new Marvel-based series, Captain America. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dr. Strange may come back again,\" says Lee. \"It was made into a two hour television movie.\" His old Spiderman cartoons, too, are still in syndication. \\n\\n \\n\\n He claims to work \"about 28 hours a day,\" and a look at his dizzying list of activities supports this claim. Besides running the Marvel headquarters, Lee makes frequent trips to the West Coast to develop shows for ABC and CBS, writes some cartoons for NBC, acts as consultant to the Spiderman and Hulk programs, writes an introduction to each of the dozens of Marvel books published each year, writes occasional books and screenplays of his own, gives lectures all over the country, and — what to some would be a full-time job in itself — writes the plot and dialogue not only for the Spiderman newspaper strip, but also, since November, for a Hulk newspaper strip that already appears in more than 200 daily papers worldwide. \\n\\n \\n\\n Few people know Manhattan as well as Stan Lee. Born the son of a dress cutter in Washington Heights, he has made the Upper East Side his home for the past 15 years. \"I\u0027m a big walker,\" he explains. \"I\u0027m a fast walker: I can easily average a block a minute. So if I want to walk to Greenwich Village, I give myself an hour — 60 blocks. I wouldn\u0027t know what time to leave if I took a cab.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Asked about new projects in the works, Lee mentions that Marvel is planning to produce some motion pictures that will be filmed in Japan. \"And I have a contract to write my autobiography,\" he adds. \"I was surprised and delighted that they gave me five years to do it. So I presume I\u0027ll wait four years; maybe in that period, something interesting will happen to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44938.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
