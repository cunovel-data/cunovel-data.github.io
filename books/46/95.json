{"id":1333,"no":95,"title":"EASTSIDER TOM WICKER","content":"EASTSIDER TOM WICKER \\n\\n Author and columnist for the New York Times \\n\\n \\n\\n 6-2-79 \\n\\n \\n\\n Something unusual was happening up ahead: that much he was sure of, although no sound of gunshots reached Tom Wicker\u0027s ears as he rode in a press bus in the presidential motorcade through the streets of Dallas on November 22, 1963. Gazing out the window, he observed crowds of people running about in confusion. Shortly afterward, outside Parkland Hospital, the full extent of the tragedy was announced to the world, and Tom Wicker, the only reporter from the New York Times who was present that day, rushed off to write the biggest story of his career. \\n\\n \\n\\n Working feverishly through the afternoon, he came up with a 106 paragraph account of the day\u0027s events that dominated the Times\u0027 front page the following morning. In decades to come, students and historians will turn to Wicker\u0027s story on microfilm with perhaps a sense of wonder that it omits no facts of major importance, and contains virtually no errors. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tom Wicker was writing for history that day, and largely as a result of his masterful performance, he was elevated the following year to the position of the Times bureau chief in Washington. In 1968, he was appointed associate editor of the newspaper, and in 1971, he returned to New York in order to concentrate on his column, \"In the Nation.\" For the past 13 years, the column has appeared three times weekly in the op-ed page of the Times. \\n\\n \\n\\n A tall, ruddy-complexioned, powerful-looking Southerner of 52 with a country-boy manner and a Carolina accent as thick as molasses, Wicker has managed to combine his lifelong career in journalism with an independent career as a book author. The most successful of his seven novels, Facing the Lions, was on the New York Times best-seller list for 18 weeks in 1973, while his most recent nonfiction work, On Press: A Top Reporter\u0027s Life in, and Reflections on, American Journalism, was published last year by Viking and will soon be released as a paperback by Berkley. \\n\\n \\n\\n In an interview at his office in the Times building, the affable, articulate Wicker responds to an opening question about whether journalists are less accurate today than in the past by saying, \"No, I don\u0027t think they ever were very accurate. It\u0027s hard to get pinpoint accuracy under pressure. I think that\u0027s an inherent weakness of daily journalism. But you have to consider that there are something like eight million words a day coming in here. It\u0027s very tough to double-check all of that by deadline. I think of journalism as being kind of like an early alert system.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In his column, Wicker has never been told what to write, never had an article killed or edited, and never been urged to conform to the Times editorial policy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Some of his pieces look best in retrospect — for example, the three columns he wrote in September and October 1977 about the dangers of storing nuclear waste. The sympathy with which he treated the prison death of convict George Jackson in a 1971 column caught the attention of inmates everywhere, and during the uprising at New York\u0027s Attica prison later that year, he was called in as a mediator and official observer. His book about the uprising, A Time To Die, (1975), won him two major literary awards and was made a Book of the Month Club selection. \\n\\n \\n\\n An engaging public speaker who travels widely, he spent two months in \\n\\n Africa last year. At present, he is preparing a long article on Richard \\n\\n Nixon that will appear in the Sunday Times magazine this August to \\n\\n coincide with the fifth anniversary of the ex-president\u0027s resignation. \\n\\n \\n\\n Asked for his opinion on the seeming resurgence of Nixon as a public figure, Wicker smiles and says, \"I\u0027m sure Al Capone could have drawn a crowd the day he got out of prison. I don\u0027t think Nixon has been revived. He never was dead in that sense. He left the White House under a cloud, yet he retained, I am sure, millions of people who supported him. … I myself have always discounted these reports that some future Republican president might appoint him a sort of roving ambassador. As far as his giving speeches at big colleges is concerned, I think that\u0027s all right. He may have made mistakes, but I myself would find it very interesting to read an article by Richard Nixon about foreign affairs. I think he\u0027s a man of intelligence and knowledge in this area.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For the past five years, Wicker has been married to Pamela Hill, vice president of ABC News and executive producer of the network\u0027s documentary productions. They live in a four-story brownstone on the Upper East Side. Though both enjoy cooking, their busy schedules call for many visits to local restaurants. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wicker\u0027s next book is a historical novel about the American Civil War that he has been researching for several years. \"It probably won\u0027t be completed until 1981,\" he says, \"but I expect it to be the best book I have ever done. It\u0027s certainly the one I\u0027m putting the most effort into. At the same time, the column is my first priority. That\u0027s the clock I punch. … My experience is, the more you write, the better you get at it. It\u0027s a business in which you keep sharpening your tools all the time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45040.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
