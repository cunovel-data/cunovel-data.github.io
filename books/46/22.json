At 16, she became the youngest person ever to join George Balanchine\u0027s New York City Ballet, and at 19, she was promoted to the rank of principal dancer. Since that time, 14 seasons have come and gone, but Suzanne Farrell, the girl from Cincinnati, is still the darling of America\u0027s foremost ballet company. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a dressing room interview last week at the New York State Theatre, the slender, angelic-looking Miss Farrell spoke at length about her public and private life, quickly revealing the two qualities that have enabled her to remain one of the world\u0027s top ballerinas for so long. First is her boundless energy; second is her genuine love for people and the world of ballet. Warm, funny, and articulate about her art, she discussed with enthusiasm the upcoming television special, Choreography by Balanchine, Part One, which will be aired May 23 on Channel 13. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is one of four programs we taped in Nashville,\" she said, in a voice as clear and melodic as an actress\u0027s. \"The name of the ballet I\u0027m in is Tzigane; the music is by Ravel. We did the finale before the beginning because they wanted to let go the four extra couples that were needed for that part. It was very strange — like having dessert before the meal.\" She laughed lightly, tossing back her long, silky brown hair. \"The TV studio is very small, and the camera sees things differently than the audience sees when you\u0027re on stage. Things that are done in a circle look like an oval. And diagonal movement has to be done in a straight line.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Suzanne\u0027s brightest moment in the program is a solo at the beginning, which she performs to the music of a solo violin. \"One of the things I like about doing ballet on television is that you can reach many people who have never seen live dance before. About two years ago I got a beautiful letter from an older man in Oklahoma who was certainly not in the habit of writing fan letters. Now, every time I tape a new program, I think of that man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tzigane is one of my favorite ballets, because it was the first one that Balanchine choreographed for me after I returned to the company in 1974.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In 1969, Suzanne left the New York City Ballet and spent the next four seasons with Maurice Bejart\u0027s Ballet of the 20th Century in Brussels, Belgium. When she finally wrote to Balanchine to find out the chances of dancing with him again, he simply asked when she could start. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In Brussels, the type of ballet they\u0027re used to is different, so they react differently. If you were to give them a beautiful, wonderfully stark ballet, with little costume and scenery, they might not take to it as much. … But it was a good thing to have in my career. I demand that I get something constructive out of any situation. Because life is so short that you can\u0027t afford to not give everything, every time you go out there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For the past 10 years she has been married to Paul Mejia, a former dancer who is today the artistic director and choreographer for the Ballet de Guatemala, one of Latin America\u0027s major companies. Although the couple must undergo some long separations, their marriage is a happy one. Spending time alone at her Lincoln Center area apartment does not bother Suzanne. With a steady diet of exercise classes, rehearsals and performances, and her nine pets (eight cats and a dog), Suzanne has little time to be lonely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When I have a free night, it\u0027s terrible,\" she lamented, \"because every time the phone rings, I think, \u0027Oh no, they want me for a performance.\u0027 I dance just about every night. By the time I go to bed, it\u0027s about 2 o\u0027clock. I happen to get up about 6. … On Monday, my free day, I teach at the American School of Ballet. It\u0027s such a shock to do two performances on Saturday and Sunday, and none on Monday. It\u0027s hardly worth it, because the body can\u0027t adjust. … I have always thought that actors have it easier than dancers, because it doesn\u0027t matter so much how tired your body is: all you need is your mouth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A Westsider for most of her career, Suzanne lists reading and cooking as her preferred pastimes: \"I\u0027m a great short-order cook. I think if I weren\u0027t a dancer, I\u0027d be a waitress.\" Two local restaurants she likes to frequent are Rikyu (210 Columbus Ave.) and Victor\u0027s Cafe (240 Columbus). \\n\\n \\n\\n Asked about her salary, Suzanne admitted that \"you\u0027ll never make a lot of money in ballet. It\u0027s something we do because we love it, and we have to do it to be happy. … The sole attraction is working for Balanchine and the New York City Ballet: that\u0027s something you can\u0027t put down in dollars and cents. I just assume that the company is paying us as much as they can.\" She smiled radiantly and added: \"Most dancers wouldn\u0027t know what to do with a lot of money anyway, because they wouldn\u0027t have time to spend it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44913.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
