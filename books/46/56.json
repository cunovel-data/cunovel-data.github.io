{"id":1294,"no":56,"title":"WESTSIDER ANN MILLER","content":"WESTSIDER ANN MILLER Co-star of Sugar Babies 1-12-80 Sugar Babies, the rollicking burlesque musical that rolled into Broadway last fall, was one of the most-awaited shows of the year because it signalled Mickey Rooney\u0027s return to Broadway after umpteen years. Less attention was initially given to Mickey\u0027s co-star, dazzling Ann Miller, who last appeared on Broadway in 1970 as a star of Mame. Ann, it turns out, is not only a wonderful singer and comedienne, but, in her mid-50s, is still one of the best tap dancers in America. Her fancy footwork has become a prime attraction of this box-office smash. \"I was also in George White\u0027s Scandals for a year when I was 15,\" recalls Ann in her dressing room after a performance. \"This is my third show only.\" For most of her career, she has lived in Beverly Hills, California. The veteran of dozens of movies, including On The Town with Frank Sinatra, Miss Miller is a larger-than-life entertainer who believes that her career comes first and foremost, ahead of personal happiness and family. Married and divorced three times, she has no children, but is an ardent animal lover. \"I have two beautiful dogs, Cinderella and Jasmine,\" she says in a light Southern accent. \"They look exactly alike, only one is Hungarian and the other is French. My secretary walks them. … I\u0027m very much interested in the protection of animals. I think people treat animals very cruelly, and to me, when you adopt a dog, it\u0027s like adopting a child. My little Cinderella: she was thrown out of a car by somebody wanting to get rid of her. I found her in Cincinnati in a blizzard. She almost died and I saved her life.\" By looking beyond the heavy rouge, bright red lipstick, large rhinestone earrings and fluttering false eyelashes that are part of her act, one can see that Ann appears considerably younger then her years. Sugar Babies, she points out, is not burlesque in the normal sense. \"Burlesque got sleazy in the 1940s with bumps and grinds and tassel-twirlers, but that\u0027s not what we\u0027re selling. We sell, in a sense, glorified, old-fashioned, 1920s-style vaudeville, with good production numbers. And that\u0027s what burlesque was originally. … A college professor got this together. The jokes are authentic. … Our show is for everybody. It\u0027s not dirty at all — not by today\u0027s standards.\" There is a crowd of people waiting to see Ann after nearly every show. Rooney escapes the fans by dashing out the stage door within minutes of the final curtain. \"He lives way out in New Jersey,\" explains Ann, who rents a hotel suite on the Upper West Side. \"Mickey is married and he has 10 children. He loves them all very much. … Mickey and I went to school together. He\u0027s a very nice person and he\u0027s a great pro. He may be a small man, but he\u0027s a giant in his own way.\" Miss Miller, who likes to dine at the 21 Club, Sardi\u0027s and the Conservatory, believes that Sugar Babies is a hit \"because it\u0027s timely. People are desperate to laugh. They\u0027re tired of hearing about war and the food crunch and the oil crunch. They want to be entertained.\" She has written her autobiography, Miller\u0027s High Life, which is available \"only in rate bookstores and in every library in the country. It isn\u0027t out in paperback yet, but there\u0027s some talk of it.\" Asked about a projected second volume, Miller on Tap, she says: \"It will be my life; it will carry on from where the other one left off.\" She has no secret for looking so young, except that she is a nonsmoker, drinks nothing stronger than wine, watches her diet, and avoids anything strenuous in the daytime, to save her energy for the show. With her jet-black hair, pearl-white teeth, and exaggerated makeup, Ann looks more than a little exotic. This may help to explain her belief in reincarnation. \"I really do have memories of Egypt. They\u0027re not in a form that I can describe. You sometimes just know things. You\u0027re born with knowing. I have been to Egypt three times, and I\u0027m planning to go back again and again, I want to go mainly to Luxor. I\u0027m very entranced with it. I like all the antiquities of Egypt. The present-day Egypt I have no interest in to speak of.\" Ann says she doesn\u0027t like the name of her current show. \"People think it\u0027s candy, because there is Sugar Babies candy,\" she explains, \"but in the old days, babies meant beautiful show girls. The girls had sugar daddies, so they were called sugar babies.\" A Texas native who began dancing professionally in New York at the age of 11, Ann says yes, she feels good about her career, but that \"it\u0027s been a long struggle. The sad part is, I have wanted so much to be happy, but I have never found happiness.\" Her father, who was a lawyer, left her mother when Ann was 10. Since Mrs. Miller was almost totally deaf, Ann supported them by tap dancing at Rotary Club luncheons. She retains a fear of poverty to this day. \"I save all my clothes because some day I might be poor again,\" she says. \"I have a room with nothing in it but racks of clothes. I cover them nicely, and once a year I air them out, in case they come back in style.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44981.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
