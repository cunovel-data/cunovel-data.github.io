{"id":1282,"no":44,"title":"WESTSIDER ANNA KISSELGOFF","content":"WESTSIDER ANNA KISSELGOFF Dance critic for the New York Times 6-9-79 It was 3 p.m., and as usual, Anna Kisselgoff was sitting before the computer-typewriter at the New York Times\u0027 newsroom, putting the finishing touches on her latest dance review. She had spent the morning doing research, and had arrived at the Times building around noon to begin writing the article directly on the computer terminal, using her notes taken the night before at a dance performance. At 8 o\u0027clock that evening, she would be attending yet another performance, but for the moment at least, Miss Kisselgoff had a little time to herself, and when we sat down to talk in her three-walled cubicle office facing the relatively quiet newsroom, she seemed noticeably relaxed and cheerful, notwithstanding the pile of opened and unopened mail piled high on her desk. \"We get no help: that\u0027s the problem,\" she said, in a clear, even voice with a tone that recalled Mary Tyler Moore. \"We have one secretary for nine people in the arts and architecture department. She\u0027s terribly overworked,\" Anne went on, sweeping her hands like an orchestra conductor toward the stack of mail. \"You\u0027re looking at what\u0027s left after I\u0027ve thrown away half of it. I make up the review schedule for the week based on these releases.\" Petite, attractive, and looking somewhat younger than her 41 years, the effervescent Miss Kisselgoff soon got to the root of her problem. \"This time of year, everybody wants to be reviewed. The tragedy is that dancers do wait until the spring, and then they give their one-shot concert that they have been preparing all year, and it\u0027s on the same night that 17 other dancers are giving theirs. I think it\u0027s suicidal. … We have three dance critics at the Times — Jack Anderson and Jennifer Dunning besides myself — and in the spring, all three of us are working every day, and we still can\u0027t keep up.\" Anna herself attends up to nine performances a week during the busy season. Besides her regular pieces in the daily Times, she is responsible for a long, comprehensive article in the Sunday edition. \"There has been a tremendous increase in dance activity in the past 10 years,\" she explained. \"In 1969, the year after I joined the paper, I was asked to do a rundown of dance events, and I found there was not a single week in the year that was free from dance. That was the first time it happened. \"I think the decade of the 1960s had something to do with it. That was when choreographers like Balanchine and Merce Cunningham, who used pure movement, became most popular. The audience that came to see them was a new audience that was already comfortable with abstraction. They didn\u0027t require story ballets. One of the problems with dance in the past was the people thought they wouldn\u0027t be able to understand it. But if you like plotless ballet, you don\u0027t have to understand any more than what you see. I think Marshall McLuhan was right: this is the age of television. This generation is used to watching images without getting bored.\" She has no favorite dancers, but her favorite choreographers come down to two — George Balanchine and Martha Graham. \"You don\u0027t have any young choreographers now who are really the stature of the old ones. I can\u0027t give a reason why, except that it happened historically that the 1930s turned out to be the most creative period in dance — not just in the United States, but in most parts of the world. That\u0027s when the modern dance pioneers became active. People like Martha Graham are revolutionaries, and you just don\u0027t get them in every generation. … This applies to the other arts as well. Who are the great opera composers of today? And frankly, are there any Tolstoys?\" Born in Paris, Anna arrived on the Upper West Side at the age of one. She attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania and later spent four years in Paris as a general reporter for several English-language newspapers, but otherwise she has been a lifelong Westsider. Dance has always been one of her prime interests: she studied ballet for 10 years while a child, and remained an avid fan long after realizing she would not become a professional dancer. In the mid-1960s, Anna wrote an article on a major dance festival for the international edition of the New York Times in Paris. This led to similar assignments. In October 1968, shortly after she returned to Manhattan, the Times hired her to assist chief dance critic Clive Barnes. She quickly found herself writing many first-string reviews, and when Barnes resigned almost two years ago, Kisselgoff was named to replace him. One of the disadvantages of her job, Anna pointed out, is that she is frequently approached by strangers at intermission. \"I feel that everybody who agrees or disagrees with me can do so by mail. I don\u0027t want to have long discussions with people I don\u0027t know, because I think it\u0027s an invasion of my privacy as a person.\" The advantages, however, far outweigh the inconveniences. \"I can even enjoy bad dance,\" she quickly added. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m very happy doing this job. The day that I\u0027ll no longer be interested in watching a dance performance, I think I should quit and go on to something else.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44935.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
