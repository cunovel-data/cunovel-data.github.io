{"id":1269,"no":31,"title":"WESTSIDER PAUL GOLDBERGER","content":"WESTSIDER PAUL GOLDBERGER Architecture critic for the New York Times 12-3-77 \"What is architecture? It\u0027s the whole built environment. It\u0027s the outside of a building, the inside, the function; it serves social needs, physical needs. … And a building has an obligation to work well with the buildings around it — at least in the city.\" The speaker is Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for the New York Times. His immaculate suit and tie, refined manners, dry wit, and somewhat formal way of speaking seem to mark him a Timesman even more than the carefully researched, colorfully written articles that have poured out of his pen in the last four years. As a critic, Goldberger is accustomed to vocalizing opinions and facts in equal measure. His open-mindedness on architectural styles is demonstrated by his apartment, a lavish, ultramodernized suite of high ceilinged rooms inside one of the oldest buildings on Central Park West. The interview begins with a trick question: \"What is the third tallest building in New York?\" (Answer: the Empire State Building.) He fields it without cracking a smile. \"I guess the question is, do you consider the World Trade Center two buildings?\" he says. \"I guess it\u0027s like asking whether Grover Cleveland was two presidents or one because he served two non-consecutive terms. … The World Trade Center was not necessary built functionally or very pleasing aesthetically. It was built as a kind of symbol of power by the Port Authority. I\u0027m used to it now; human beings can adapt to anything. I even like going to the restaurant at the top and the restaurant at the bottom. It\u0027s the floors in the middle I don\u0027t like.\" He points to the new Citicorp Center on East 53rd Street as an example of modern architecture at its best, and the mosquelike Cultural Center at Columbus Circle as an example of the opposite. \"It\u0027s pretty horrible,\" says the critic, agreeing with a newspaper writer who recently labeled the Cultural Center one of the 12 ugliest buildings in Manhattan. \"It\u0027s a very silly building; it\u0027s so obviously dumb. But it doesn\u0027t particularly bother me. It\u0027s almost innocent, it\u0027s so silly.\" Lincoln Center, too, draws his barbs. \"I find it very pretentious. Rather boring, really. It\u0027s a set of imitations of classical themes. The buildings are an unfortunate compromise because the builders were afraid to build something really modern, or to design something that really looked like a classical building. … There\u0027s a feeling that they sort of want to be modern and sort of want to be classical and end up being a very unsatisfying compromise.\" A New Jersey native who developed a passion for architecture in his earliest years, Paul Goldberger attended Yale University and then worked as a general reporter for another newspaper. Several years later he became an editorial assistant for the Times. In 1973 there came an opening for an architectural writer, and because the Times knew of his background, Goldberger was given the first shot at the job. \"It was fabulous,\" he recalls, because it was what I always wanted to do. And it was very much a matter of luck — of being at the right place at the right time.\" His articles appear most often in the daily Times; Louise Huxtable remains the chief architectural writer for the Sunday paper. Why would a sophisticated Timesman choose the West Side over the East? \"There are many more wonderful buildings on the West Side,\" says Goldberger. Unfortunately not many of the buildings on the West Side have been kept up as well as the East Side. … In terms of apartment house architecture, Central Park West is probably the best street in New York. It has all the grandeur and beauty and monumentality of Fifth Avenue and it also has the relaxed atmosphere.\" There\u0027s not one West Side,\" he continues. \"There\u0027s at least 10. Around here is one neighborhood. Riverside Drive is another. Up by Columbia is another. … One of the reasons I like my own neighborhood is because though it is very much West Side, it\u0027s handy to the East Side and midtown. I walk through the park all the time.\" Any chance that Manhattan\u0027s skyscrapers will eventually weigh down the island? \"No,\" replies the critic emphatically. \"First, the island is very, very solid rock and nothing could cause it to sink. The other factor, especially today, is that buildings are not all that heavy, because they\u0027re being built with lighter materials and more modern engineering methods. So a huge new building like the Citicorp, which is 900 feet high, is not any heavier than a building 500 feet high built 30 years ago. And since we don\u0027t have earthquakes, this is probably the safest environment in the world to build a skyscraper.\" Although studying and writing about architecture is \"more than a full-time job,\" Goldberger manages to keep abreast of the legal aspects of buildings as well, including tenants\u0027 rights, rent control, zoning laws and redlining. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is another of his interests. \"I think landmarking is crucial to the city,\" he testifies. \"A city exists in time as much as space. It\u0027s the mixture of new and old buildings that gives the city life and vitality.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44922.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
