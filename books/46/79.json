{"id":1317,"no":79,"title":"EASTSIDER DR. LEE SALK","content":"EASTSIDER DR. LEE SALK \\n\\n America\u0027s foremost child psychologist \\n\\n \\n\\n 5-5-79 \\n\\n \\n\\n At one time, the name Salk was synonymous with one thing only — the revolutionary polio vaccine discovered by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953. In the 1970s, however, another national figure of the same name has emerged — Dr. Lee Salk, Jonas\u0027 younger brother, who is probably the most highly respected and best-known child psychologist in America today. \\n\\n \\n\\n The most successful of his five books, What Every Child Would Like \\n\\n His Parents to Know (1972), has been translated into 16 languages, while \\n\\n his most recent work, titled simply Dear Dr. Salk, was published in \\n\\n March by Harper \u0026 Row. \\n\\n \\n\\n A soft-spoken, highly energetic man who bears a close physical resemblance to comedian Phil Silvers, Dr. Salk recently invited me to share his thoughts in an interview at his Upper East Side apartment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What I try to do as a psychologist,\" he said, sitting in a large, circular chair in his spacious library, \"is to use all the media to present what I consider useful psychological information that has been distilled for the consumer — to take the jargon out of it, and the ambiguity, so people can use it to deal effectively with their problems. While most people see me as a child psychologist, I\u0027m really an adult psychologist who has focused on some of the most difficult issues that affect all people. … In my initial years of practice, it became clear to me that most of the problems originated in childhood, and I felt that perhaps the front line of mental health is really in those early, critical years.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Since 1972, he has been writing a column titled \"You and Your Family\" for McCall\u0027s magazine, which has a readership of 16 million. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I frequently deal with family concerns, including problems that have to do with older people,\" he explained. \"I choose a different topic each month. Frequently the topic revolves around a number of letters that come in. The June issue, for example, has an unusually large column because we\u0027re dealing with sexuality. We get hundreds and hundreds of letters, so I can\u0027t answer them personally, but I do read them all. When I\u0027m giving a speech across the country, I like to use airplane time to catch up on my mail.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As a television personality, he appears at least twice a week on NBC\u0027s News Center 4. His off-the-cuff manner is no deception: Salk does each of his broadcasts live, without a script, speaking spontaneously on a current issue. \\n\\n \\n\\n His latest book, Dear Dr. Salk, answers questions ranging from the spacing of children to problems specific to teenagers. When asked how his approach compares to that of Ann Landers or Dear Abby, Salk replies: \"I must say that they fall far short of what I\u0027m trying to do. These people are not professional psychologists. They tend to sensationalize — to appeal to the voyeuristic tendencies people have. I\u0027m not saying they don\u0027t help people, but they don\u0027t always provide people with knowledge. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A good deal of what I say is not direct advice. In answering a question, I try to provide knowledge about the problem, which the person can use, to answer his or her own question. I really feel I shouldn\u0027t give people a series of do\u0027s and don\u0027ts\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His knowledge is based on a 25-year career as a professional clinical \\n\\n psychologist. Following his graduation from the doctoral program at the \\n\\n University of Michigan, Salk spent three years teaching at McGill \\n\\n University in Montreal, then returned to Manhattan, where he grew up. \\n\\n He still maintains a private practice, and is on the staff at Cornell \\n\\n University Medical School, the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic and the \\n\\n Lenox Hill Hospital. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dr. Salk won the custody of his two children, Pia and Eric, in 1975 after a precedent-setting divorce trial in which it was ruled that he was \"the parent that can best nurture their complex needs and social development.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A problem of many parents, he said, is not that they spend too little time with their children, but that \"it\u0027s basically useless time, because they\u0027re not actively involved with the child.\" Salk himself makes a point of having breakfast and dinner with Pia and Eric virtually every day, and includes them in his social life whenever possible. \"Their friends are frequently my dinner guests.\" Each summer he spends three months with them at an island retreat in Maine, while commuting to New York for his professional commitments. Dr. Salk enjoys cooking, and also likes to go to restaurants. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dr. Salk\u0027s newest project is a 13-part series for public television, to be aired starting September 29. He will appear each week with three children to discuss such topics as love and attachment, divorce, and \"making a family work.\" The programs, he said, \"are geared to family viewing time, so children and their parents can watch together.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45024.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
