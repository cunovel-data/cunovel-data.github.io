{"id":1304,"no":66,"title":"WESTSIDER BETSY PALMER","content":"WESTSIDER BETSY PALMER \\n\\n Star of Same Time, Next Year \\n\\n \\n\\n 4-1-78 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, do you take shorthand?\" said Betsy Palmer as we sat down in her dressing room to chat between shows. \"I could always read and write shorthand. I worked for the B \u0026 O Railroad as a stenographer before I went away to school and learned acting. I guess if I had to, I could brush up and go back to it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It\u0027s most unlikely that she\u0027ll ever have to. Even if her Tony Award winning play, Same Time, Next Year, should happen to close, Betsy would find herself swamped with offers for choice acting roles. But her hit show about the lighter side of adultery won\u0027t be closing for a long time yet. It is currently being made into a film starring Ellen Burstyn and Alan Alda. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A lot of people think of me as a personality rather than an actress, and when they come to see me they expect to see that personality,\" says Palmer, who has one of the more recognizable names and faces on Broadway. \"Mostly people know me from panel shows. It\u0027s been a double-edged sword for me. When they see me doing something that\u0027s really dramatic, they say, \u0027My God, she can act!\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She has made countless appearances on What\u0027s My Line?, Girl Talk and The Today Show, but to most television viewers she is best remembered as the bright, beautiful, All-American girl who for 11 years was a panelist on I\u0027ve Got a Secret. \\n\\n \\n\\n During her years of TV stardom Betsy was doing plenty of serious acting — everything from Shakespeare to Peter Pan to Ibsen. She has made five Hollywood films and performed the lead in numerous Broadway shows, including South Pacific, Cactus Flower and Tennessee Williams\u0027 Eccentricities of a Nightingale. Few of her roles, however, have been as demanding as Doris in Same Time, Next Year. \\n\\n \\n\\n To begin with, she and her co-star, Monte Markham, are the only characters in the play. Second, the play\u0027s action takes place over a period of 25 years, in which Doris goes through momentous changes. In doing this transformation smoothly, Betsy creates a character so believable and lovable that the audience forgives her for cheating on her husband, which she does one weekend a year in order to meet her lover George. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Doing the play takes all my energy.I\u0027m a single woman now, and have been for three years. But if I were involved with somebody now, it would take up a lot of my energies. So it doesn\u0027t bother me; when the time comes for me to be involved, I will be. Right now, I\u0027m really quite satisfied to come here six days a week and have a fantasy life. It has all the good things in it and none of the bad things. … It gives you such a rainbow of colors to express yourself within, that I find it terribly rewarding and gratifying. I am never bored with the show.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George, like Doris, is married and has three children, and he too goes through drastic changes of attitude during the time period from 1951 to 1976. But while George wins the audience\u0027s respect and sympathy, Doris steals their hearts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I get out there and I feel such love. All of a sudden they begin to adore her. They\u0027re watching her spread her wings and finally fly. … The adultery is done with such taste. You see two people who really love their respective mates, and their children.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In her cozy backstage room at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, which is decorated with Christmas lights, Betsy demonstrates an overbubbling friendliness and an extremely fluent style of speech. An interview with her is both a pleasure and a challenge, for she talks about each subject with an enthusiasm that makes it hard for anyone to interrupt and go on to the next question. \\n\\n \\n\\n Her memories of those panel shows? \"You know, we used to do Secret right in this theatre. We must have done it here five, six, seven years easily. There are a lot of guys here now, on the backstage crew, who were here with Secret. It\u0027s nice to be working with them again. … But I\u0027m not interested in the past. The past is an illusion, as is the future.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Betsy has been an off-and-on Westside resident ever since she first came to New York in 1951. When doing Same Time, Next Year she is subletting a friend\u0027s apartment on Riverside Drive. Her 16-year-old daughter frequently comes down from Connecticut to spend time with her on the West Side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve lived on the East Side but my preference is the West Side. Let\u0027s face it, Broadway\u0027s on the West Side. Where Broadway is is where my heart is.\" Flowers by Edith (69th and B\u0027way) is one of Betsy\u0027s best-loved Westside establishments. \"I\u0027ve become very good friends with her. I\u0027ve gone to her house to parties.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In response to an obvious question, Betsy scolds gently: \"Never ask an actress what she\u0027s going to do next. Opera stars say, \u0027You know, I\u0027ve got this opera lined up, then this one, then this,\u0027 but an actress doesn\u0027t usually know. … I just hope that the next play I\u0027m able to do will have a lot of humanity in it, like this one. It\u0027s not enough to get a bunch of laughs. You\u0027ve got to be touched inside.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44991.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
