{"id":1288,"no":50,"title":"WESTSIDER ALAN LOMAX","content":"WESTSIDER ALAN LOMAX Sending songs into outer space 9-17-77 On August 20, when the Voyager 2 spacecraft blasted off for a trip beyond the solar system, it carried on its side a unique record player and a single phonograph record. Included on that record are 27 musical selections that the New York Times has called \"Earth\u0027s Greatest Hits.\" If, someday, extraterrestrial creatures play the record and enjoy it, they will be most indebted to the man who chose 13 of the songs — Westsider Alan Lomax. That Alan\u0027s advice should be so highly respected by a committee that spent eight weeks choosing the other 14 songs is a testimonial to his musical reputation. Ever since he became head of the Folk Music Archives of the Library of Congress at age 20, Alan has devoted his life to the preservation and study of international folk music. Following the footsteps of his late father, musicologist John Lomax, Alan has taken his recording equipment to six continents in search of the rapidly disappearing musical treasures of the world. I finally caught up with Alan and met him for an interview on a Friday evening at his office/apartment on West 98th Street. One room, I observed, was lined wall to wall with tapes and record albums. Another was filled with music books, a third with computer readouts, and a fourth with movie films. Alan\u0027s foremost interest right now is cantometrics — the science of song as a measure of culture. Recently he published a book titled Cantometrics: A Method in Musical Anthropology. Accompanying the volume are seven cassette tapes. The songs are arranged in an order that will teach the student to interpret their general meaning without knowing the language. \"When you learn the system, you can understand any music,\" said Alan. \"We analyzed 4000 songs from 400 societies around the world. Out of that study has come a map of world music.\" He then showed me a musical chart of Europe, the Far East, and Indian North America. Thirty seven aspects of the music, including rhythm, volume and repetition, had been analyzed by a computer to make a graph. \"Each aspect of the music,\" said Alan, \"stands for a different social style. It\u0027s like the guy who says, \u0027I don\u0027t know anything about music, but I know what I like.\u0027 It means that kind of music stands for his background and what he believes in.\" Alan played a tape for me containing a Spanish folk song, an Irish jig and a song from Nepal, explaining some of the elements as the music was playing. \"By the time you\u0027ve heard two or three tapes,\" he said, \"you get used to the world standards of music. In primitive societies, he added, \"everybody knows the same things about everything, so being specific is a bore, and repetition is what they like. You don\u0027t impose your boring accuracy on everyone. By the same token, primitive people find it much easier to sing together than, for example, New Yorkers of different backgrounds. In the latter case,\" said Alan, \"everybody starts singing at a different tempo, like six cats in a bag. But if you take people who live together and work together, it\u0027s like clouds rolling out of the sea.\" Alan was not impressed with the 1976 movie Bound for Glory, about the life of American folk singer/songwriter Woody Guthrie during the Great Depression. The movie ends with Woody leaving Hollywood for New York to perform in a coast-to-coast radio show. The man who hosted that show was Alan Lomax. \"We collaborated on a number of things,\" recalled Alan. \"It was an enormous pleasure. He was the funniest man that ever talked. And he was so quick. That\u0027s what was wrong with the movie. Talking with Woody was like playing a game of jai alai. He was a deeply passionate person, and tremendously gifted. He got up in the morning and wrote 25 pages before breakfast just to warm up.\" Though Alan can sing and play the guitar, he does not regard himself as a performer but rather as a \"funnel\" for other musicians. During the 1940s he helped launch the careers of people like Burl Ives and Pete Seeger by providing them with songs and putting them on the radio. \"We set out to revive the American folk music in 1938, and by God we did it,\" said Alan. \"By 1950 it was a national movement.\" Alan spent the next 10 years of his life in Europe, where he produced a definitive 14-album collection of international folk music. Then he moved back to the U.S. and settled on the Upper West Side, where he has lived for the past 15 years. His residential apartment is located two blocks from his office. Besides his research in cantometrics, done in cooperation with Columbia University, Alan is now preparing for publication a study on international dance movement and its relations to society. Energetic, jovial, and looking considerably younger than his years, Alan has no doubts about the lasting value of his work. \"I make my living as a very hard-working scientist,\" he said. \"By using scientific methods, I can absolutely refute the ideas of those who say that Oklahoma doesn\u0027t matter, or that the Pygmies might as well be exterminated. Each of these people, we have found, has something for the human future, for the human destiny.\" * * * The Mighty Lomax from The Westsider, late 1977 It\u0027s oldies night on the radio. The d.j. has promised to play nothing but the greatest hits of the \u002750s and \u002760s, and sure enough, here they are — \"Irene Goodnight\" sung by the Weavers; \"Tom Dooley\" by the Kingston Trio; \"Abilene\" by George Hamilton IV; \"Midnight Special\" by Johnny Rivers; and \"House of the Rising Sun\" by the Animals. All of these songs reached number one on the charts. And they have something else in common: all are genuine American folk songs of unknown authorship that might have been lost forever if they had not been discovered and preserved by John and Alan Lomax, the famous father-son folklorist team. The folk music explosion in America that peaked in the early 1960s and continues today owes more of a debt to the Lomaxes than to any performer or songwriter. John Lomax died in 1948 at the age of 80. His son Alan, 62, has been a resident of New York\u0027s Upper West Side for the past 15 years. Working seven days a week at his 98th Street office and his 100th Street apartment, Alan has carried on his father\u0027s work with a remarkable talent and energy. He has gone far beyond the simple collecting of folk songs, and maintains a dizzying schedule of activities — writing books, catching planes for Europe or Africa, making movies, producing record albums and tapes, and heading a musical research project for the Anthropology Department of Columbia University. Fathers and Sons The elder Lomax was primarily a songhunter. His first collection, Cowboy Songs, was published in 1910. It contained such gems as \"John Henry,\" \"Shenandoah\" and \"Home on the Range,\" which he heard for the first time in the back of a saloon in the Negro red light district of San Antonio. Alan was born in Texas in 1915. When he was 13 years old his father gave him an old-fashioned cylinder recording machine, and the boy was hooked. He became a full-time song scholar at 18. In that same year his father was put in charge of the newly created Archives of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress in Washington. When Alan was 20 he took over as archives director. The father-son team eventually provided more than half of the 20,000 songs in the collection. The Lomaxes wrote many books together; they introduced American folk music into the nation\u0027s public schools, and through their radio programs in the U.S. and Europe, made celebrities out of such performers as Burl Ives, Pete Seeger, Leadbelly and Woody Guthrie. Whereas John Lomax was interested in the music for its own sake, Alan began some time ago to look for the deeper meaning, or social significance, of folk songs. In his many trips around the world he built up a collection of recordings from every continent and virtually every major culture. Along with a co-worker he developed his findings into the new branch of anthropology known as cantometrics. When the Voyager 2 spacecraft left Earth last August for a journey beyond the solar system, it carried on its side a unique record player with a specially made disk for alien beings to hear and enjoy. The disk contained 27 musical selections, which have been named \"Earth\u0027s Greatest Hits\"; 13 of them were chosen by Alan Lomax. The following interview was conducted in various rooms of Alan\u0027s office on a Friday evening in August, 1977. One room was filled with recording equipment, tapes and records; another with music books; a third with computer readouts; and a fourth with movie films. Lomax spoke rapidly and found it difficult to sit still. He is not a neat housekeeper, a sharp dresser or a master of the social graces. He is, however, a tireless worker who gives the impression of being totally absorbed in his work. A large, robust man, he will no doubt continue to be a major figure in the field of international folk music for years to come. Question: What exactly is cantometrics? Answer: It means, literally, singing as a measure of culture. With it, a song performance may be analyzed and related to a culture pattern. Each aspect of music stands for a different social style. By using cantometrics you get the story of mankind in musical terms. … It\u0027s like the guy who says, \"I don\u0027t know anything about music but I know what I like.\" It means that kind of music stands for his background and what he believes in. Q: How did you develop this new science? A: I started this project in 1961. … We analyzed 4,000 songs on a computer. Out of that has come a map of world culture. There are 10 big groups or styles of music. Stone age people have style 1. … We found there\u0027s a similarity of Patagonian music and Siberian, even though these people live near the opposite poles. … Along with studying song, we have also studied dance and conversation in the same way, from film. I probably have the biggest collection of dance film in the world — 200,000 feet. Maybe the New York Public Library has more, but that\u0027s specialized in fine art. Q: What\u0027s the purpose of cantometrics? How can someone learn it? A: I recently published a set of seven cassette tapes of folk songs from all 10 cultural levels around the world. In the booklet that comes with it, the songs are broken down and analyzed so that the student can learn the cantometrics system on his own. When you learn the system, you can understand any music, even if you don\u0027t know the language it\u0027s being sung in. By the time you\u0027ve heard two or three tapes, you get used to the world standard of music. Cantometrics measures things like repetition, ornamentation, rhythm, melody, orchestral arrangement. … It analyzes music in relation to social structure — political organization, community solidarity, severity of sexual sanctions. Cantometrics makes the world\u0027s music into a geography. Q: How does American music differ from that of the world in general? A: In our culture, for example, we didn\u0027t have much repetition until rock and roll came around. And that represents another influence. … As you know, we of European background don\u0027t sing very well together. Everybody starts singing at a different tempo, like seven cats in a bag. But if you take people who live and work together, it\u0027s like clouds rolling out of the sea. … It turns out that the people with the most repetition in their songs have the most primitive cultures — at least, in relation to their economic development. Everybody knows the same thing about everything. So being specific is boring, and repetition is what they like. You don\u0027t impose your boring accuracy on everyone. Q: What do you consider the real beginning of the folk music movement in America? A: It all began in Texas in 1885 when my father heard \"Whoopee Ti Yi Yo\" on the Chisholm Trail. He was a country boy. He grew up in Texas, and the cowboys drifted past. He wrote the songs down just for the hell of it. Then he got a grant from Harvard and found out how important it was. He was the first person in the country to use a recording device, in 1902. Q: Did you know Woody Guthrie very well? A: Know him? I made him famous. I had a coast-to-coast radio program when Woody first came to New York. I introduced him when he first sang on radio. He stayed at my house. … They offered him a huge contract, but he just walked off and went to Oklahoma. He was a deeply passionate person, and tremendously gifted. First of all he was the funniest man that ever talked. And Woody was so quick: talking to him was like playing jai alai. He got up in the morning and wrote 25 pages before breakfast just to warm up. And there was always a slightly strange thing about woody — an itchy feeling that he had. It might have been beginning of the disease which later killed him. Q: What\u0027s your connection with Pete Seeger? A: Peter Seeger is my protege. I gave him his banjo. The banjo was a dead issue, and he came to me and asked what he should do with his life. He was a Harvard hippie. … We got to be colleagues. We worked on the whole revival of the American folk music. I taught him most of his early songs. Q: Were you ever a performer yourself? A: Yes, I\u0027ve made a few records. But I was always more of a funnel. I regarded myself as a dredge, dredging up the rich subsoil of American folk and putting it back on the developing music scene. We set out to revive the American folk music in 1938, and by God we did it. By 1950 it was a national movement. Q: What are some other things you\u0027ve done? A: I did the first oral history — the Leadbelly book and the book on Jelly Roll Morton. The Leadbelly movie (1976) was taken from that oral history. For Jelly Roll Morton, I transcribed the tape and made it into a piece of literature. The story has been bought for a movie by the same people who made the Woody Guthrie movie, Bound for Glory. Q: Have you done a lot of research outside the United States? A: Yes, I spent 1950 to 1960 in Europe assembling all the best material that had been collected into 14 albums, geographically arranged. Then I started thinking about what I heard on albums — not what musicians or literary people heard, but what I heard. Then I met some people at the National Institute of Mental Health who were interested in the norms of healthy behavior. I indicated to them that I was that getting at the behavior styles of the people of the world. They gave me some dough and I got a staff together. Q: How was the American folk music scene then? A: I was very shocked when I came back to the United States in 1960. The musical scene at Washington Square made me sick. They said, \"Alan, those people you talked to are all dead.\" I kind of withdrew from the whole business. … Later I set up a concert in Carnegie Hall and brought in the first bluegrass group and the first gospel group to perform in New York. People stormed the stage. There were fistfights and everything. Well, that was the whole end of people saying New York was the center of the folk scene. Q: What do you think of Bob Dylan? A: Dylan came along in the footsteps of Ramblin\u0027 Jack Elliott. He lived with Woody for a while, and picked him as his model. He absorbed the whole southwestern style from Woody. And the country for the first time fell for a national American vocal style. Then Dylan left the scene and went middle class after three years. He turned his back on folk music, turned his back on people. I think he did a big disservice to the country when he did that. … The whole thing has been to make urban mobile people have a folk music of their own. It\u0027s not a bad idea. Terribly boring though. Q: Do all your projects lead to one goal? A: I make my living as a very hardworking scientist. I do that because it was important finally to take this huge world that was coming out of loudspeakers, and get down to the meat of it so that it can be used for the betterment of our future … so that we can keep all the treasures of the past and use them. That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing. I\u0027m doing it in a scientific way so that I can absolutely refute the idea of those who say that Oklahoma doesn\u0027t matter, or that the Pygmies might as well be exterminated. Each of these people, we have found, has something for the human future, and for the human destiny.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44941.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
