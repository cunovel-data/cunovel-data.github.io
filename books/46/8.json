And even though Clive Barnes was recently replaced as the New York Times\u0027 drama critic, he remains the most-quoted authority in the newspaper ads. He is still the Times\u0027 dance critic. He still does his daily radio spot on theatre for WQXR Radio. He still lectures around the country and writes a column for the London Times. At 50, Barnes does not mind the slightly calmer pace his life has taken. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why I was replaced,\" he says. \"Papers have these policy decisions. I suppose they wanted a change. They wanted to split the two desks, dance and drama.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A refined, affable Englishman, Clive Barnes welcomes me into his West End Avenue home and invites me to sit down and have some coffee for five minutes while he puts the finishing touches on an article. His slim, attractive wife Trish and his 15-year-old son Christopher talk to him while he works. Soon the article is finished and he is relaxed in an armchair, ready to answer questions. He holds a pen in his lap and occasionally clicks it as we talk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Really, I much prefer New York to London,\" says Barnes, who spent the first 38 years of his life in the British capital. \"I\u0027ll never leave New York, ever. When I first came here visiting before I came here to live, I adored it. It\u0027s just been a very long love affair between myself and the city.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Born the son of a London ambulance driver, Barnes won a scholarship to Oxford University, and while a student there began to write reviews on theatre and dance. Following graduation, he worked in city planning for 10 years while moonlighting as a critic of theatre, dance, films and music. Thus he built up a reservoir of knowledge in all the major performing arts. In 1965, several years after Barnes got into full-time journalism, he was doing such an impressive job as dance critic for the London Times that the New York Times made him a handsome salary offer to fill the same role for them. Two years later the Times offered him the post of drama critic as well. Barnes kept the dual role until this year, when the \"new\" New York Times asked him to concentrate strictly on dance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly American dance is the most important in the world, and has been for at least 25 years,\" he says. \"The reason for this is that you have a very strong classical tradition, as well as a very strong modern dance tradition. This is the only country in the world that has these two traditions, and they intermesh, so that you have George Balanchine on one side and Martha Graham on the other. This means that American dance is astonishingly rich.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Barnes feels that Americans\u0027 television-viewing habits have made them more appreciative of the subtleties of dance movement: \"That same kind of visual orientation that has made spectator sports what they are spins off, and spreads over to things like dance.\" He notes that dance in New York appeals more to the young — to people who have been reared on television. Broadway audiences, on the other hand, \"tend to be menopausal, and opera audiences to be geriatric.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Barnes finds the West Side the ideal place to live because of its proximity to his work. Trish, herself an expert on dance, usually accompanies him to opening-night performances. \"We can get to any Broadway theatre in 10 minutes,\" he says, \"or walk to Lincoln Center. I can get to the paper in about 10 minutes. The West Side has changed a little over the years. I think it\u0027s gotten rather nice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n On nights off, Barnes enjoys going to the Metropolitan Opera or to a movie. His son Christopher loves rock music and hates drama. He also has a 14-year-old daughter, Maya. The family enjoys dining at many restaurants in the Lincoln Center area, including Le Poulailler on 65th Street near Columbus. \\n\\n \\n\\n I ask Barnes if he can think of any plays that have been forced to close because of unkind reviews. \"That would presume it was an important play which the critics misunderstood and killed,\" he says. \"I don\u0027t think this has actually happened. A play that gets awful notices by everyone is not the victim of a vast critical conspiracy. It\u0027s usually a bad play. Harold Pinter\u0027s The Birthday Party got bad notices in London but it recovered and went on and became successful.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For those who miss Barnes\u0027 views on theatre in the Times, his radio broadcast can be heard on WQXR (1560 AM and 96.3 FM) Monday through Friday, right after the 11 p.m. news. \\n\\n \\n\\n Trish, Clive\u0027s biggest supporter, has no complaints about being the wife of a celebrity. \"It\u0027s very enjoyable, actually,\" she says with a wide smile. \"You meet fascinating people and see all the best things there are to see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44899.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
