{"id":1328,"no":90,"title":"WESTSIDER VICTOR TEMKIN","content":"WESTSIDER VICTOR TEMKIN \n Publisher of Berkley and Jove Books \n \n 1-26-80 \n \n Victor Temkin, who looks like a character out of Dickens and comes across with the gruff friendliness of television\u0027s Ed Asner, is sitting in his midtown office on Friday afternoon trying to deal with three things at once. The telephone is jangling, visitors are dropping by unannounced, and I\u0027m throwing him questions about the publishing business. \n \n What complicates matters is that Mr. Temkin is in the process of moving his offices to another floor; has ad and his staff of 80 are packing everything into cardboard boxes, and now it\u0027s impossible to find anything. But the short, pink-faced man with gold-framed spectacles takes it all in stride. He lights a Lucky Strike, props one hand against his chin, and explains how he got to be the head of Berkley Books, which has long been the paperback division of G.P. Putnam. \n \n \"I came to New York in 1960 as a lawyer. I became assistant U.S. attorney in \u002761. I stayed there till \u002764,\" he relates in short bursts of speech. \"Then I went into private practice until September of 1967, when I got into the book business. I became house counsel at Bantam Books, and worked my way up, and later became a vice president. I came here in July of 1977 as president and chief executive officer. \n \n \"Since that time, we purchased Jove Books from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. It\u0027s another paperback house. … Berkley does largely reprints of hardcovers, but Jove does exclusively paperback originals. Together, the two companies put out about 300 or 325 books a year. Of these, 120 are from Jove.\" \n \n Berkley Books, he admits, is one of the smaller paperback houses, perhaps sixth or seventh. But the company manages to get its share of best-sellers. At New Year\u0027s two were in the nation\u0027s top 10 — Mommie Dearest by Christina Crawford and Nurse by Peggy Anderson. Mommie Dearest, says Temkin, \"is the first time we\u0027ve had a story of child abuse at that level off society, which I think is a great thing for the people to read. It isn\u0027t only poor kids that get beat up, it\u0027s the rich kids too — just as badly.\" \n \n In terms of sales and profits, he says, \"There\u0027s no such thing as an average book. It depends on what you pay for the advance and what the cost of manufacturing the book is. … I can have books sell 50,000 copies and make a profit, or I can have books sell a million copies and lose money. … It\u0027s not hard to spend a million dollars on a book. That\u0027s easy to do. The hard thing is to find a book like Nurse, where you didn\u0027t pay the million for it and you can sell a million and a half. We jumped in and bought it early on, before it was a hardcover best-seller.\" \n \n Berkley\u0027s hottest author at present is John Jakes, whose seven-volume Kent family saga has sold 30 million copies. Jakes\u0027 new book, The Americans, is scheduled to be out in February 1980. \"The first printing is over three million copies,\" says Temkin. \"We expect it to be a number one best-seller.. … What a great success story. John has been around for many many years and he\u0027s written a lot of books but he\u0027s never had the commercial success until that came along. You can never tell in this business. That\u0027s why we\u0027re in it: You don\u0027t know what tomorrow\u0027s going to be.\" \n \n Temkin, who anticipates losing money on seven out of 10 books he publishes, does frequently travels around the country on business, and makes it a point to observe what people are reading on buses and in bookstores. \"I think kids today are coming back to books. Because it\u0027s the best form of entertainment there is for the money,\" he says. \"I read a lot. I try to read two, three books a week. I have a rule that I don\u0027t read books by authors who are friends of mine that I am publishing, because I know it will be nothing but trouble. … I can\u0027t tell them I don\u0027t like a book, and if I tell them I do like it, they may not believe me. But I like writers. I enjoy being around them.\" \n \n A native of Milwaukee, Temkin lives on the West Side with his wife Susan and their 8-year-old twins, Andrew and Peter. Susan has a busy career as a caterer who runs her own cooking school for kids. \n \n In December, 1977, Berkley brought out a book about the Jonestown tragedy, The Guyana Massacre by Charles Krause, which was written, published and distributed in a single week. \"It\u0027s instant journalism,\" Temkin explains. \"We\u0027re going to do a book late in 1980 about the 1980 election, to tell how and why it happened.\" \n \n He laughs when asked whether his skills as a lawyer have been helpful in his publishing career. \"No, I think I\u0027ve forgotten most of what I know about being a lawyer. It\u0027s not the same.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45035.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
