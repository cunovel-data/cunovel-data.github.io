{"id":1276,"no":38,"title":"EASTSIDER JAY JACOBS","content":"EASTSIDER JAY JACOBS \n Restaurant critic for Gourmet magazine \n \n 2-9-80 \n \n It is a familiar scene to New York restaurateurs: an out-of-town visitor arrives clutching a magazine, turns to an article, and orders the items that have been underlined. Whether the magazine is current or several years old, the chances are that it is Gourmet and that the article is a review by Jay Jacobs, Gourmet\u0027s New York restaurant critic since 1972. \n \n Its monthly circulation of 600,000 makes Gourmet the most widely read food publication in the English-speaking world. But Jacobs, who is responsible for writing three lengthy reviews per issue, is quick to point out that, in spite of his knowledge of the business and his love of cooking, he would never consider opening a restaurant himself. \n \n \"I think everybody born in this century has fantasized about a restaurant, but I think it would be insane,\" he says in a voice as rich and mellow as vintage port. \"One of the great tragedies of the restaurant business is that people who cook well at home often think that\u0027s all it takes. … If you\u0027ve got any interest in food and the least bit of talent, you can probably cook a better meal for four people than you\u0027ll ever get in any restaurant in the world — if you want to invest that kind of labor and time, and concentration. But there\u0027s a huge gap between doing that and serving anywhere from 70 to 130 people at night, all wanting different dishes. It becomes a tremendous problem of strategy and logistics.\" \n \n Affable, low-keyed, and very small of stature, Jacob displays a wry wit while telling how he began his career as a painter, cartoonist and illustrator before turning to full-time writing in 1956. For years he worked mainly for art publications, and he still writes a bimonthly column for theArtgallery magazine. His first book, a quickie titled RFK: His Life and Death, came out in 1968. He is also the author of A History of Gastronomy, New York a la Carte, and Winning the Restaurant Game (McGraw-Hill, 1980). \n \n Winning the Restaurant Game is an extremely humorous and entertaining volume that is notable for its exotic vocabulary. However, the book\u0027s message is not to be taken lightly — that restaurant dining is a complex game in which the best players can expect better service, better food, and the lasting affection of the owner. All the conventions of dining out, including who to tip and how much, are discussed in depth. Among the subchapters are \"Humbling the Opposition,\" \"The Uselessness of Menus,\" \"Addressing Flunkies,\" and \"Securing Advantageous Tables.\" \n \n His next book, Winning the Kitchen Game, is due from McGraw-Hill next winter. \n \n Jacobs dines out at least once a day while in the city. He visits restaurants several times before doing a review — always anonymously, and generally accompanied by others. \"My job,\" he says, \"is to find worthwhile places that our readers will want to go to. The magazine\u0027s policy is not to do unfavorable reviews. If I think a place stinks, I don\u0027t go back and I don\u0027t review it. … Most of our readers are knowledgeable about food, somewhat self-indulgent, affluent, and well-travelled. When they come into New York, they don\u0027t want to find some cut-rate taco house, and they don\u0027t want to know about the bad places. They\u0027re only in for a few days, and they want to hit the high spots. \n \n \"The daily press have a different readership and a different function. … When they do a favorable review, it can damage a restaurant in that it generates a sudden spurt of interest that the restaurant can\u0027t handle.\" \n \n The father of four boys, Jacobs is a very sociable person who enjoys throwing parties for 50 to 60. To prepare the food, he says, \"I lock myself in the kitchen for three or four days.\" \n \n His Gourmet reviews are so detailed that Jacobs gets letters from readers across the country who tell how they have recreated a night at the Four Seasons or 21 \"by analyzing what I have written, and approximating the dishes.\" But what makes his job particularly gratifying is the restaurant people themselves. \n \n \"I\u0027m very impressed by these restaurant guys. If you travel in Europe you see them when they\u0027re 13 years old, schlepping suitcases in some motel and dreaming of the day when they open their own restaurant. They usually come out of small towns or even villages, and don\u0027t have the benefit of birth or upbringing or schooling. And the next thing you know, it\u0027s 30 years later and they can converse very adequately with Henry Kissinger or Jackie Onassis or anyone else, and maintain a business and make it work.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44929.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
