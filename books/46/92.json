{"id":1330,"no":92,"title":"WESTSIDER RICHARD THOMAS","content":"WESTSIDER RICHARD THOMAS \n John-Boy teams up with Henry Fonda in Roots II \n \n 2-17-79 \n \n Seven years ago, on Christmas Day 1972, CBS aired a holiday program titled The Homecoming about a family living in Appalachia during the Great Depression. All who were involved in the project went their separate ways after the filming, including a young actor from the Upper West Side named Richard Thomas. But it drew such a favorable response that CBS decided to turn it into a series. The rest is history: The Waltons became a hit and made Thomas a television superstar. \n \n For five years he charmed his way into American homes as the beloved John Boy. Then in 1976 he decided to leave The Waltons in order to concentrate on his marriage, write poetry, do stage acting, perform ballet and make movies. On February 18, in what is certain to be his most closely watched performance to date, Richard will star in the first segment of ABCs Roots II, playing the son of a wealthy railroad lawyer (Henry Fonda) who marries a black schoolteacher. He will appear, to a lesser extent, on the two following evenings as well, before leaving the scene as a 54-year-old man. \n \n In an interview at the New York School of Ballet at Broadway and 83rd Street — which is owned by his parents, Richard Thomas III and Barbara Fallis — he talks enthusiastically about his role in Roots II. \"My character is an actual historical figure,\" says Richard. \"He had just come back from college and didn\u0027t know what he wanted out of life. … Obviously in 1892 or 3, his marriage was considered a disaster. His wife Carrie was Alex Haley\u0027s first teacher. Her school is still in Tennessee today.\" \n \n Sporting a newly grown moustache, casually dressed, and still boyish looking at 27, Richard carries an air of tremendous confidence about him. Yet his voice changes to one of awed respect when he speaks of Henry Fonda: \"The thing about working with someone like Fonda is that his presence is so strongly felt that you get caught up in watching him. It\u0027s really uncanny. I had to pinch myself to get back into the scene. And Olivia de Havilland, who plays my mother — she\u0027s extraordinary, too. We got along great.\" \n \n Earlier this year, Richard Performed in the Los Angeles production of Streamers, and also made a TV movie for CBS, Getting Married, which was broadcast last summer. In the late fall, during one of his frequent trips to the West Side, he donned ballet tights to play the character role of Hilarion in the U.S. Terpsichore Company\u0027s production of Giselle, starring his 19-year-old sister Bronwyn Thomas, one of the most highly acclaimed young ballerinas in the city. \n \n Richard\u0027s parents are both former principal dancers for the New York \n City Ballet. They were on tour in Cuba when he was born, and the first \n language he learned was Spanish. He began acting at the age of 7. \n Growing up on West 96th Street, he attended McBurney High School and \n Columbia University. \n \n Although he moved to Los Angeles in 1971, Richard still considers \n himself a Westsider. \"I just know it like the back of my hand,\" he says. \n \"I\u0027m not sure I could live without LA anymore, but whenever I\u0027m here, \n I feel completely at home. There\u0027s a kind of underground chic on the \n Upper West Side that I kind of respond to. I\u0027m very comfortable around \n Spanish-speaking people. I speak Spanish, and my wife is part Mexican. \n I like the Latin flavor.\" \n \n He and his wife Alma have been married since 1975; they have a 2-year old son, also named Richard Thomas. \"He talks a blue streak,\" comments the proud father. \"Sometimes he gets very blue. You have to watch what you say around him.\" \n \n In 1994 the young actor published his first book of poetry. Titled simply Poems by Richard Thomas, it won the California Robert Frost Award the following year. His second volume of poetry, In The Moment, is scheduled for publication by Avon early in 1979. \n \n Another of his prime interests is music. \"I\u0027m a big operagoer,\" he says. \"I\u0027m really partial to Verdi and Wagner, if you have to get it down to two.\" He also plays the dulcimer. \"When I go to Kentucky this week, I\u0027m going to call on a man who\u0027s one of the great dulcimer makers in the United States.\" \n \n The three-stringed mountain instrument, an important component in the folk music of Appalachia, caught Richard\u0027s fancy long ago, during a visit to his grandfather\u0027s Kentucky farm, where he spent many summers as a boy. Both of his grandparents on his father\u0027s side are still living. Like an episode from The Waltons, the family often gathers at the farm on Thanksgiving Day. \n \n The original Roots was seen by more people than any other program in the history of television, but Richard does not dwell on his important role in Roots II. He prefers to talk about the fulfillment he has found in marriage. \n \n \"I can\u0027t imagine not being married at this point,\" he says, the thick gold band gleaming on his finger. \"If my marriage weren\u0027t happy, I couldn\u0027t make the right kind of career decisions. One supports the other. They\u0027re part of the same package.\" Does he expect to have more children? Richard smiles broadly and replies: \"That\u0027s really my wife\u0027s department.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45037.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
