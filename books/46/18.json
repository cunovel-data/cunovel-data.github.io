{"id":1256,"no":18,"title":"WESTSIDER MIGNON DUNN","content":"WESTSIDER MIGNON DUNN The Met\u0027s super mezzo 3-8-80 Don\u0027t look for opera posters, photographs or reviews on the walls of Mignon Dunn\u0027s Westside apartment. The Tennessee-born Metropolitan Opera star, one of the world\u0027s most sought-after mezzo-sopranos since the early 1970s, prefers to keep her two lives separate. She has no scrapbooks and saves no clippings. \"I look forward to what I\u0027m doing tomorrow,\" she explains. \"I don\u0027t like those stand-up-and-sing roles. I loves to play wicked women. But you have to make them just as human as possible,\" she continues, her gold jewelry jingling as she settles onto the sofa. Tall and attractive, with large, expressive features, Miss Dunn is hospitality personified as she talks about her life and career over a glass of wine. This season at the Met she starred in both Lohengrin and Elektra. In the spring she will appear in Aida on the Met tour, and perform the role of Kundry in Parsifal with Germany\u0027s Hamburg Opera. After that she plans some orchestral and opera concerts across the country. Long praised for her dramatic talents as well as her vocal skills, Miss Dunn has already signed contracts for performances into 1984. Although a few noted operas, such as Carmen, Samson et Dalila, and Joan of Arc, have a mezzo in the title role, most operas feature the higher-voiced soprano in the lead and a mezzo in a character role. \"We may not have the main roles, but we have some of the best parts in opera,\" she says in her rich Southern accent, shouting the last word as if from an overflow of energy. \"Not many of the roles I get today are angelic. It\u0027s often the \u0027other woman,\u0027 or the woman who causes the trouble.\" Married since 1972 to Kurt Klippstatter, a conductor and music director from Austria, Miss Dunn has never had any children of her own, somewhat to her regret. But she and her husband frequently have their nephews and nieces staying for extended periods. \"Our niece Evi, from Austria, is living with us now. She\u0027s like a little daughter, and I adore her. She\u0027s 18, and she\u0027s going to go to nursing school.\" Mignon and Kurt are a very gregarious couple who enjoy throwing huge dinner parties. Mignon\u0027s cooking, like her singing, is international. \"I cook Austrian. I cook New Orleans. I cook some nice Italian and French things. I\u0027m going to be in Paris later this year for six weeks, and I really seriously want to go to the Cordon Bleu Cooking School, and take at least a three-week course.\" Around the late 1960s she was based in Germany for several years. There, says Dunn, many new operas are premiered each year, while in the U.S. they are a rarity. \"It all comes back to the fact that we don\u0027t have government subsidy. We have to worry about selling tickets. Opera is an expensive thing, and until we get this government support — which people for some reason are afraid of — we cannot be as experimental as we would like to be.\" Brought up on a cotton plantation in Memphis, she entered her first singing contest at the age of 9 and spent most Saturday afternoons in her girlhood listening with rapt attention to the Metropolitan Opera broadcast on the radio. Immediately following her high school graduation, she was auditioned by Met scouts and encouraged to go to New York. There, after several years of study, she won a national competition that launched her career. Dunn spent part of three seasons with the New York City Opera before joining the Met. It was many years, however, before her talents were fully appreciated there. \"It only took me 11 auditions to get into the New York City Opera, and at least that many at the Met. So take heart, everybody,\" she says, laughing merrily. She has made numerous opera recordings, including the role of Susan B. Anthony in Virgil Thompson\u0027s The Mother of Us All and Maddalena in Rigoletto. \"I don\u0027t ever listen to my recordings,\" she says when asked to name her favorite. \"I listen to the playbacks, when I can do something about it. But I don\u0027t listen to recordings afterwards because there\u0027s nothing that I can do about it, and I know I\u0027m going to find a million things that I don\u0027t like.\" Mignon and her husband recently bought a house in Connecticut, but they will keep their Westside apartment. \"We have three acres,\" she says proudly. \"I hope we\u0027ll get a couple of horses and I would love a goat. I love goats. They\u0027re so cute. I love animals — we have a Great Dane and a Labrador — and I\u0027m very much into the business with the Animal Protection Institute. Most of the experiments that are done with animals today: there\u0027s just no reason for it. … I mean, I don\u0027t think we need another shampoo on the market, really.\" Her voice rises with feeling as she pursues the subject. \"It is really the slavery of today. People don\u0027t have any feelings for animals, and I\u0027m just rabid. I really am. It is so disgraceful. Anytime anybody wants me to do a benefit for animals, just call me and I\u0027ll do it any day I\u0027ve got free. I would like to do more benefits. Actually, I\u0027m hardly ever asked to, but if I were asked, I would do it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44909.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
