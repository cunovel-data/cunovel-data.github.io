{"id":1270,"no":32,"title":"EASTSIDER MILTON GOLDMAN","content":"EASTSIDER MILTON GOLDMAN \\n\\n Broadway\u0027s super agent \\n\\n \\n\\n 4-14-79 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pardon me — just one more call to make,\" said Milton Goldman, pushing the buttons on his nearest desk phone. \"Go on, you can ask me questions at the same time,\" he added, holding the receiver to his ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you the biggest theatrical agent in the world?\" I said. He returned my gaze evenly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Others have said it. It would be immodest for me to say it — but I probably am,\" said Goldman, who by this time had reached his party and was inviting the young actress on the other end to a Broadway opening that night. He chatted with her for several minutes, his Jack Bennyish voice breaking occasionally into rich laughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sitting upright behind a desk-sized table covered with papers, folders, notebooks and play scripts, the ruddy-complexioned, jacketless Goldman looked far more relaxed that I had expected of a man who, in his 32 years as an agent, has handled the careers of close to 5,000 actors and actresses. Among those he has helped \"discover\" are Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Grace Kelly, Lee Marvin, Charlton Heston and Faye Dunaway. And though Goldman has become a celebrity in his own right, he still exudes the low-keyed charm of a friendly neighbor talking over a fence. \\n\\n \\n\\n The appearance is no deception: he owes his success not to high-pressure tactics, but to an encyclopedic knowledge of the theatre on both sides of the Atlantic, a keen judgment of which shows are best for his clients, and a long-proven record for trustworthiness. By title, he is vice president in charge of the theatrical division of International Creative Management, which is matched in size only by the William Morris Agency. Unofficially, he serves as father confessor, rabbi, psychiatrist, and best friend to many of the top stars he represents. Attending the theatre up to five times a week, he is always on the lookout for new clients. His weekends are devoted to reading and casting new plays. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t resist talent, and when I see a talented young actor or actress, I want very much to help realize their potential by opening as many doors as I can for them,\" he explained, gripping the arms of his chair. \"I don\u0027t think of my job as work. For me, it\u0027s fun. And I never know where the one begins and the other ends. Because I\u0027m that lucky individual whose private life and public life are one and the same thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Every year he takes a vacation to Europe on the Queen Elizabeth II. \"I\u0027m in Paris for a week and London for about three weeks.\" In slow, carefully chosen sentences, he stated, \"I represent many English clients because my knowledge of the English theatre is probably better than anyone else in the American theatre. Every year in London, I get the same suite in the Savoy Hotel and give great parties. I go to at least eight plays a week — sometimes as many as 10. So I get to see all the plays in London. And I know all the English actors and they know me.\" Among his British clients: Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir John Gielgud. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"American performers excel in the musical comedy theatre, where dancers and singers also very often are fine actors. This is not true in England. Dancers are especially hard to cast in London, though I think that is changing now. … It\u0027s sad that the American theatre can\u0027t support serious plays. They\u0027re either musicals or they\u0027re comedies. I think a healthy theatre should be able to support the works of serious playwrights. This season, we happen to have on Broadway an important play by an American playwright — Arthur Kopit\u0027s Wings, which stars our client Constance Cummings, who is an American actress who went to England and made her reputation abroad, and has now returned here to great acclaim.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A native of New Brunswick, New Jersey, Goldman witnessed his first Broadway show in the summer of 1929, and from that day forward, the theatre was his passion. For 10 years he worked as a tire salesman at a family-owned business. Then, through his friend Arnold Weissberger, a noted lawyer, Goldman was offered a job as a theatrical agent at no base salary, but with a $25 weekly expense account and a 25 percent interest in any clients he signed up. Success came to him almost at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n A lifelong bachelor, Goldman today shares an apartment with Weissberger on the Upper East Side. His favorite local restaurant is the Four Seasons. \"I go there all the time for lunch; that\u0027s my main meal of the day. I think it\u0027s the best restaurant in the world.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The actor\u0027s life, he believes, \"is a sad and a difficult one. Every time you get a good part, the next part has to be bigger — more money. As you reach the top, it becomes tougher and tougher to get those parts.\" Nevertheless, Goldman does not find his own job at all frustrating. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pressures? Yes, there are many pressures. But I have said this before: there are so many rewards for me when I see a client in whom I believe get a great break in the theatre or films of television. It\u0027s a source of great satisfaction. And with the number of clients I represent, each day brings some rewards. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve often said to clients: \u0027I have many lives to live.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44923.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
