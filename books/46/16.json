{"id":1254,"no":16,"title":"EASTSIDER TONY CRAIG","content":"EASTSIDER TONY CRAIG \n Star of The Edge of Night \n \n 1-26-79 \n \n Although Los Angeles has long since taken over prime-time TV programming, New York is still the headquarters for daytime drama — also known as soap opera. Of the 13 \"soaps,\" 10 are filmed in New York, and of these 10, five have been on the small screen since the 1950s, including The Edge of Night, which debuted in 1956. \n \n The show\u0027s crime/mystery format has not changed much over the years, but one thing that has changed, of course, is the cast of characters. Tony Craig, who plays attorney Draper Scott, joined the show in November, 1975, and since then he has become one of the most popular male stars in daytime television. \n \n Tony owes his success not only to his good looks and his acting ability, but also to his likable off-camera personality. Upon meeting Tony on the set of The Edge of Night during a busy shooting session, I cannot help noticing the affection that the other cast members display toward him. His ability to get along with everyone involved with the show — especially producer Nick Nicholson, and headwriter Henry Slesar — has enabled Tony to develop the role of Draper Scott into one of the four leading characters. \n \n \"I was given a piece of advice when I started,\" says Tony. \"One: keep to your business and do what you\u0027re told, and two, answer your fan mail. I answer all my fan mail with a very personal response. … In the National Star, I once said I was looking for Miss Right, and I got inundated with letters. Some people sent plane ticket, asking me to come and see them.\" \n \n As we sit down to talk in one of the dressing rooms, Tony puts on a tie and jacket for an upcoming bar scene, but because only his top half will be shown on camera, he does not bother to change out of his blue jeans and running shoes. Tall, athletically built and boyish in appearance, he discusses his work with an infectious enthusiasm. \n \n \"The closer I get to the character, the more I see that he and I are very much alike,\" says Tony in his rapid speech. \"It\u0027s funny, the way I\u0027ve assimilated him and he\u0027s assimilated me. It\u0027s like the dummy in Magic. The character has gone from a very impetuous, aggressive, almost nasty young man to a very quiet, strong, very reserved lawyer. It\u0027s changed to the point where I\u0027m a pillar of the community. Whenever there\u0027s a problem, call Draper. \n \n \"I think I allow Tony a little more anger, a little more frustration, than Draper allows himself. … I\u0027m very normal, I\u0027m very average, I\u0027m very aggressive. Some people would say pushy. But I do what I have to.\" \n \n Approximately 260 half-hour shows are filmed each year for The Edge of Night, and Tony appears in most of them. He starts his day by studying lines — \"we have about a week ahead to go over the script\" — and then goes to the studio on East 44th Street, where each scene gets just one run-through before the final taping. A quick learner, Tony finds that \"I have plenty of time to do what I want.\" Last year he launched a successful musical nightclub act and performed in two stage plays by Neil Simon — Barefoot in the Park with Maureen O\u0027Sullivan and The Star Spangled Girl. \n \n Another important aspect of Tony\u0027s life is sports. When growing up in Pittsburgh, he says, \"all I ever wanted was to be an athlete. My whole life was baseball. But I just wasn\u0027t good enough.\" Now he works out three times a week at the 21st Century Health Club on East 57th Street, jogs, plays tennis and racquetball, and is on the softball and basketball teams of both The Edge of Night and the ABC Eyewitness News. Says Tony: \"The Eyewitness News team plays all over the tri-state area and gives the proceeds to charity.\" \n \n Unlike his TV character, who recently brought up the ratings by marrying the beautiful April Cavanaugh (played by Terry Davis), Tony lives alone in an Upper East Side apartment. \"How can I put this without sounding full of beans and self-pity?\" He remarks. \"I find that life is a lot more exciting when you share it with somebody. … The girl I\u0027m dating now is a news reporter in Baltimore, Jeanne Downey. Long distance isn\u0027t the next best thing to being there, believe me.\" \n \n When Tony won the part of Draper Scott over 200 other actors, he was working part-time as a bartender at Joe Allen\u0027s in the theatre district. \"I was doing commercials and a lot of modeling — nothing significant. Before this show, I\u0027d never made more than $1,200 a year from acting. I didn\u0027t expect to get the part, because they wanted someone in his mid 40s. They rewrote the script for a younger attorney. My agent signed me up on a lark. That just goes to show: when it happens, it happens.\" \n \n Tony hates to cook — which is fine with the restaurateurs in his area. His favorite dining spot is La Bonne Soupe (3rd Ave., 57th-58th St.): they have the prettiest waitresses and most pleasant food.\" \n \n Asked about the lasting value of soap opera, he quickly replies: \"I believe television has an obligation to do nothing but entertain. Everything on television, even news, is show business. If it weren\u0027t, they wouldn\u0027t have ratings and handsome newsmen.\" \n \n Anyone wishing to hear from Tony should write to him at ABC, 1330 \n Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10019. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44907.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
