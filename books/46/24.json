{"id":1262,"no":24,"title":"EASTSIDER GERALDINE FITZGERALD","content":"EASTSIDER GERALDINE FITZGERALD Actress, director and singer 3-15-80 Anyone hearing her rasping, throaty, Irish-accented voice for the first time might think she were suffering from laryngitis. But those who have come to love and admire Geraldine Fitzgerald over the past 40 years hear nothing but earthy humanity in the voice. One of the most versatile actresses in America, as unorthodox as she is gifted, Miss Fitzgerald at 66 remains at the height of her career, constantly juggling a variety of projects, as she says, \"like somebody cooking a meal with many courses.\" We\u0027re sitting in her Upper East Side living room, which is decorated in white from floor to ceiling — carpet, chairs, tables, sofa, and even the television. The only picture is a childhood portrait of her daughter Susan Scheftel, now a 27-year-old graduate student. \"I like light unimpeded,\" explains Geraldine, her rosy face breaking into its customary smile. \"And if everything is white, it\u0027s different in the morning and it\u0027s different in the middle of the day, and it\u0027s different all the time.\" A slender, handsome woman with a penchant for long flowing skirts and bright lipstick, whose straight gray hair descends halfway down her back, Geraldine is soon talking about Mass Appeal, the two-character play that she is directing at the Manhattan Theatre Club; it will open in mid May. \"It\u0027s by a very young author called Bill Davis. We did it last October at the Circle Rep Lab, and it was very successful, but it needed strengthening points. So Bill has just completed the ninth draft. … Milo O\u0027Shea is going to star in it. He\u0027s Ireland\u0027s premier comedian and a magnificent dramatic actor too.\" Miss Fitzgerald\u0027s next acting role will be in a play titled Eve. \"It\u0027s about a woman who runs away from home to seek her own internal freedom, like Nora in A Doll\u0027s House. The only difference is, she\u0027s my age. So of course her options are few. And she goes right down to the bottom: she becomes a derelict. And then slowly, slowly, slowly she comes up to find some kind of strength and independence. It\u0027s a drama, but a very comedic drama.\" Her third major project at the moment is to prepare her acclaimed one woman show, Street Songs, for a small Broadway house such as the Rialto. She started to take singing lessons about 10 years ago, and introduced her one-woman nightclub act in 1975, employing her remarkable acting technique to make the songs personal and moving. She has performed the act at Reno Sweeney, at Lincoln Center, in a one-hour special for public television, and at the White House for President and Mrs. Carter. \"I don\u0027t sing what\u0027s called \u0027folk songs.\u0027 People think I do. I sing songs that are very — winning. Because the songs that people sing when they\u0027re on their own — whether singing in the streets, singing in the shower, singing in the car — they do not sing losing songs. We didn\u0027t know that for a long time. \u0027We\u0027 is Richard Maltby Jr., who did Ain\u0027t Misbehavin\u0027. He\u0027s my colleague and partner and he directed it. \"At first we couldn\u0027t understand why a marvelous song like \u0027Loch Lomond\u0027 was sort of rejected by the audience, and then a song like \u0027Danny Boy\u0027, that you\u0027d think everybody\u0027s sick of, was acceptable. Well, \u0027Danny Boy,\u0027 believe it or not, is a winning song. At the end of it, the girl says, \u0027Even if I\u0027m dead, if you come back and you whisper that you love me still, I\u0027ll hear you in my grave.\u0027 And then I\u0027ll know that you\u0027ll be beside me for eternity. Whereas \u0027Loch Lomond\u0027 starts off so well, but each verse says \u0027But me and my true love will never meet again … \" She began her acting career at the Gate Theatre in Dublin while in her teens, came to the U.S. in 1937, and acted with Orson Welles\u0027 Mercury Theatre on the Air before heading for Hollywood, where she made such classic films as Dark Victory, Watch on the Rhine, and Wuthering Heights, for which she received an Oscar nomination. In 1946 she settled on Manhattan\u0027s East Side, and has been based there ever since, although she frequently returns to Hollywood to act in movies. Perhaps even better known for her stage roles, she names Eugene O\u0027Neill\u0027s poignant, autobiographical Long Day\u0027s Journey Into Night as her favorite play. When it was revived Off Broadway in 1971, her portrayal of the morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone became the biggest hit of her stage career. Miss Fitzgerald has recorded this play and others for Caedmon Records. Married to Stuart Scheftel, a wealthy executive and producer, she has one son from a previous marriage, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, the hugely successful young director who was nominated for a Tony Award for Whose Life is this Anyway? Miss Fitzgerald is the first actress ever to receive the Handel Medallion, New York\u0027s highest cultural award. If Geraldine has one regret about her career, it is that it took her \"so many decades to get up the courage to sing. Everybody told me not to, because I have such a funny voice. … Then I realized that I needed a vehicle for expressing what I feel about the world and about people that was very flexible, and was mine. And if the audience would put up with the harsh sounds, then I could use it. And evidently they can, so if they can now, I guess they always could.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44915.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
