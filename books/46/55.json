{"id":1293,"no":55,"title":"WESTSIDER MEAT LOAF","content":"WESTSIDER MEAT LOAF \\n\\n Hottest rock act in town \\n\\n \\n\\n 10-21-78 \\n\\n \\n\\n For several years, up until last fall, Meat loaf lived in peaceful obscurity in an apartment at 25 West 74th Street. Few people outside of his own circle knew that the name applied to a gargantuan 29-year-old singer from Texas and the rock band he headed. \\n\\n \\n\\n A couple of months ago, Meat returned to his old neighborhood after a long absence. This time he caused a mob scene in the local supermarket, and, on escaping to his apartment, found people climbing on the window ledges trying to catch a glimpse of him. The reason? His group\u0027s first album, Bat Out Of Hell, which has sold three million copies since its release a year ago. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like to be rude to fans,\" says the calm, gentlemanly Meat Loaf (his legal name) during an interview at his new apartment in another part of the West Side. \"I\u0027d lie down on the floor for hours so they couldn\u0027t see me. … People magazine printed my real name and told more or less where I lived: that\u0027s why I had to move.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bare feet perched on the coffee table, he spreads his 275-pound, 6-foot frame evenly on the living room sofa. Although Meat\u0027s onstage image makes him out to be one of rock\u0027s meanest and toughest characters, in person he is totally devoid of arrogance, and in fact seems almost shy. Sam Ellis, Meat Loaf\u0027s glib road manager who arranged the group\u0027s recent trips to England, Germany, Canada and Australia, helps the interview along by adding his comments whenever Meat begins to reach for words. \\n\\n \\n\\n All the songs on Bat Out Of Hell — raucous, earthy, and intense — were written by fellow Westsider Jim Steinman, who plays keyboard with the group. After he and Meat Loaf met in 1973, they performed together frequently, but their music met with limited success. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"People were afraid of it,\" says Meat. \"The songs were long. The voices were loud. People in rock said it was too theatre. People in theatre said it was too rock and roll.\" When Meat and Jim were finally offered a contract to do an album, Steinman went to work on some new material, and wrote nearly the entire contents of Bat Out Of Hell in four months, including the gold singles Two Out of Three Ain\u0027t Bad and Paradise by the Dashboard Light — a duet celebrating teen sexuality that has been choreographed into an 8-minute show stopper by Meat and lead female vocalist Karla DeVito. \"Jim doesn\u0027t just write the songs and hand them to me. I do most of the vocal arrangements. It\u0027s really a team. It\u0027s like Sonny and Cher,\" says the gargantuan singer. \\n\\n \\n\\n Brought up in Dallas under the name Marvin Lee Aday, he tipped the scales at 185 while in the fifth grade. \"I was an only child and my parents always wanted two kids,\" he jokes. \"So they set two places at the dinner table, and I ate both meals. … I was always on the baseball team, because if they needed a base runner, they\u0027d say, \u0027Go in there and get hit by the ball.\u0027 I\u0027d back up just enough so that I wouldn\u0027t get hurt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He joined the high school choir in order to avoid study hall, and from then on, singing became his main passion. After completing high school at 15, he travelled around with a number of bands. By the time he settled down in New York, live rock music was no longer in so much demand as before. \"That\u0027s one reason I went into theatre,\" he remarks. \"Another reason was because someone hired me and I didn\u0027t have a job.\" As an singer and actor, Meat performed in some 10 Broadway and Off Broadway productions, including Hair and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, in which he also appeared in the 1975 film. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Bat Out Of Hell was first released, it did not catch on immediately. But soon a couple of influential radio stations in New York City fell in love with it. Then Cleveland and Boston began to give it a lot of air time. From there, its reputation gathered momentum across the country. As a result of the slow start, Bat Out Of Hell was still climbing on the national charts nearly a year after it came out. In Australia, it was the number one album for 10 straight weeks. \\n\\n \\n\\n This past summer the Meat Loaf band did four sellout concerts in the New York area in the space of a month. Now the band is taking it easy for a little while before returning to the studio for their second album. They plan to launch another world tour after the album is completed in March. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meat shares his apartment with 23-year-old Candy Darling, a slender, pretty dancer/singer who will be performing in an upcoming Broadway musical, Whoopee! What does Meat Loaf like about the West Side? \"I have absolutely no idea,\" he replies matter-of-factly. \"I can\u0027t stand it anywhere else.\" Among his preferred Westside hangouts: O\u0027Neal\u0027s, Gleason\u0027s, La Cantina, and Anita\u0027s Chili Parlor, all on Columbus Avenue between 71st and 73rd streets. \\n\\n \\n\\n In spite of his meteoric rise to fame, Meat Loaf sees his overall career in a different light then his fans. \"For me,\" he says thoughtfully, \"rock and roll is not an end. I\u0027d like to make movies someday. I want to direct. I want to produce. It\u0027s great to sell records, but this is not what I always want to do. It\u0027s just another step on the mountain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44980.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
