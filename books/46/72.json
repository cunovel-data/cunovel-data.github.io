{"id":1310,"no":72,"title":"WESTSIDER MASON REESE","content":"WESTSIDER MASON REESE Not just another kid 6-4-77 \"Mason, I\u0027ve got two very very important pieces of advice to give you,\" Milton Berle told the youngster when they first met. \"Don\u0027t believe in Hollywood party promises; and practice, practice and rehearse.\" Uncle Miltie\u0027s words have been a useful lesson for Mason Reese, the boy wonder of television. In 1973, at the age of 7, Mason skyrocketed to fame by winning a Clio Award for best male in a TV commercial. In the same year he co-hosted the Mike Douglas Show for a week and became a children\u0027s reporter for WNBC-TV. His picture appeared in Time, Newsweek, and on the cover of TV Guide. Mason\u0027s unique face and voice became known to millions. Since that time, however, there have been a few disappointments mixed in with the triumphs. At 11, Mason is wiser and more philosophical about show business. Along with his parents, he has learned not to place faith in verbal agreements, as Berle cautioned. The Reeses welcome me into their West End Avenue home. As I take a seat beside the \"borgasmord kid\" and look around me at the Chagall prints, Bill and Sonia, Mason\u0027s parents, pull up armchairs to listen in and help out. But during the interview, Mason needs no more help with his answers than he did with his first audition at age 5, when he beat out 600 other children to become the spokesman for Ivory Snow. After that he endorsed such products as Ralston Purina, Thick and Frosty, and Underwood Meat Spread, winning a total of seven Clios to date. He\u0027s been co-host with Mike Douglas for three weeks and has appeared as a television guest with countless other celebrities. One of my first questions is about children\u0027s rights. \"I think children have enough rights as it is,\" he says. \"They\u0027re with their families, they go to school, they have the pleasure of learning. … and they realize that when they grow up they\u0027ll be able to have more and more fun, as long as they don\u0027t go on a mad rampage when they\u0027re kids.\" Which type of people are most likely to grab him or pick him up? \"It\u0027s always the middle-aged Italian ladies and the Jewish grandmothers,\" he says authoritatively. \"Some people don\u0027t want to treat a kid like a human being. They want them like a puppy dog; instead of petting, it\u0027s pinching.\" When it comes time to talk about Mason\u0027s not-so-successful ventures, Bill — a producer of audiovisual shows and an expert in 3-D design work — takes over. He tells about the Broadway show that was written and ready to go, with Mason as one of the leads, that folded up and disappeared without warning or explanation. He tells about the ABC pilot titled Mason, which cost $250,000 to make and was never televised; about the movie offers that were never followed through; about the Howard Cosell Show — with Mason as co-host — that was canceled shortly after it began. In spite of these setbacks, Mason recently did some Munchkins commercials for Dunkin\u0027 Donuts and will go to California this summer to do some ads for Birdseye frozen french fries. While the Reeses remain optimistic about the future, they try not to build up their hopes on a new project unless it is something solid. For show business is, after all, a business. Mason has lived on the West Side for all of his 11 years. \"I don\u0027t seem to understand why everyone thinks the East Side is classier,\" he says. \"I think they\u0027re friendlier people on the West Side, because people on the East Side get snobby. Most of my friends are on the West Side.\" His favorite eating places? \"I love the Greek restaurants — the Four Brothers (87th \u0026 Broadway) and the Argo (72nd \u0026 Columbus). Greeks are okay, aren\u0027t they mom? I like restaurants that are a little bit dumpy, without much decor.\" When I run out of questions, I ask Mason if there are any other comments he wants to make. \"I think you\u0027ve asked what everyone else has asked,\" he replies honestly. And then with a smile: \"Except that I\u0027ve given you different answers. \"Wait, there\u0027s one thing,\" he goes on. \"I\u0027d like my allowance raised to five dollars.\" Then, leaning back on the, sofa looking as content as a man celebrating his 100th birthday, he adds: \"I\u0027ve really had no gripes in life. Except that I\u0027d like people to stop calling me a midget, and to stop pinching me.\" Some people who have never met Mason Reese in person unfairly assume that he is a spoiled brat with pushy, exploitive parents. In fact, Bill and Sonia are warm, creative people who are fully aware of the great responsibility they have in bringing up their extraordinary son. Mason is not only brilliant, but a gentleman. He should be making movies, and with a bit of luck, he will be, soon. Having met him, I can only repeat — not improve on — the words of Tony Randall: \"I tell you this with neither hesitation nor embarrassment. … I\u0027m a fan of his for life.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44997.html","bookId":46,"book":{"id":46,"title":"100 New Yorkers of the 1970s","description":"简介： 《百位1970年代纽约人》出版于2005年，是由作者麦克斯米勒德为纽约本地报纸《电视信息报》所写的210篇人物专访中精选出一百篇结册，采访对象多为艺术界和娱乐界名人。人物专访往往具有一定的时效性，涉及诸多时代背景要素，会提及各种人物、地点、组织、事件等等。因此...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
