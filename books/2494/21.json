He lay on the ground, too beaten to move or even groan, blood flowing from every orifice he possessed. His state of mind had shut down to the barest impulses and he\u0027d never wished harder in that moment that he was AP. If he could have escaped the pain of this body and summoned help, he would have. Instead, he could do nothing but bear witness to Jade\u0027s assault.\\n\\n And Tiff remained MIA, John remembered with a sickening horror in the pit of his stomach.\\n\\n He watched Howie swing Jade around and punch her in the face. Like she was a guy. She fell like a limp ragdoll and John closed his eyes against the most acute misery of his life, unconsciousness sweeping him away on a black sea that rushed toward death.\\n\\n Caleb\\n\\n I awoke with Clyde\u0027s face in front of me again and had that overwhelming feeling of déjà vu slide over me, giving me a case of chicken flesh.\\n\\n I sat for several moments without a thought, I was a total blank.\\n\\n That ended when my parents stuck their heads beside Clyde\u0027s.\\n\\n \"You did it, I thought he was going to...\" Mom covered her mouth, tears spilling over the knuckles of her hand, her eyes tightly shut against them.\\n\\n I sat up and Clyde helped me off the ground.\\n\\n The pieces of the disaster tumbled all around me, broken glass falling like rain.\\n\\n But that\u0027s not what fell. Snow floated from a sky gone pewter gray, pregnant and angry clouds glared down on the ashes of the Weller home.\\n\\n I hung my head and cried in front of my parents, my friends, and the troop of responders that were all in various stages of wakefulness.\\n\\n Clyde wrapped me in his arms. \"We will find her, Master.\"\\n\\n I knew Frazier had her before Clyde confirmed it with his words.\\n\\n I saw Jezebel stooped over Terran and ran to his side, sliding in beside him.\\n\\n He looked like death.\\n\\n As I watched, I felt his signature hover on my radar, bleeping in and out of existence.\\n\\n John was fighting death.\\n\\n And I was its master.\\n\\n I had never been more torn in my life. My best friend lay dying from a beating given to him by a Graysheet assassin who now had the love of my young life.\\n\\n I weighed my options.\\n\\n Finally, I took John\u0027s cold hand in mine while his parents quietly sobbed in the background.\\n\\n I held death at bay as John\u0027s blood soaked through the knees of my jeans and tears flowed down my face, dripping off my chin and hitting our joined hands. Men\u0027s hands.\\n\\n Jezebel worked as a medic held a bag of blood above John, pulsing a unit into him even as it pumped out of his body.\\n\\n I felt Clyde\u0027s large hand grip one shoulder; Dad\u0027s the other.\\n\\n We waited and I focused on John as Frazier got a head start.\\n\\n With my Jade.\\n\\n Gramps wasn\u0027t waking up and nobody knew why. I watched the medics fold him into the back of the ambulance with John in its twin.\\n\\n Jezebel and I had managed between the two of us to stabilize him.\\n\\n But Jezebel still had a day\u0027s worth of work to do on him.\\n\\n Meanwhile, Tiff was gone and I had a sneaking suspicion we knew exactly who was behind that.\\n\\n And Jade was even now in the hands of someone who was a known Manipulator. A good one.\\n\\n I was now without my Null side-kick.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t ask my friends to take this on.\\n\\n I sat there collecting my thoughts while gearing up to try to find Jade... somehow.\\n\\n Then Jonesy was there. \"I have an idea, Hart.\"\\n\\n He looked at me and I said, \"Now\u0027s not the time for bullshit, Jones.\"\\n\\n \"Hey man.\" He held up his hands. \"No bullshit.\"\\n\\n \"K, lay it on me.\"\\n\\n \"First, let\u0027s get the hell out of here before the \u0027officials\u0027 round us up for the cattle call.\" He gave me a significant look and I stopped moving. I could do nothing for Jade if they took me to get shot up with the reversal juice.\\n\\n Jonesy studied my face, letting that brain of his show. \"I see that you feel me, Hart.\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" I said slowly, nodding. The wail of the sirens taking Gramps and John to our home away from home, the hospital, plowed through the sloppy snow that slushed all over the road, now dangerous and icy.\\n\\n I looked at the parents. My dad gave me a slight nod. \"Go.\"\\n\\n \"No Kyle,\" Mom begged and Dad looked at her. \"He\u0027s no safer here.\" He nailed her with a stare. \"In fact, he might do better finding Jade.\"\\n\\n \"Howie Frazier is dangerous!\" Mom sounded off loudly.\\n\\n Dad and I looked at each other then he turned to face Mom again, taking her by the shoulders. \"So is he,\" Dad said slowly with each word articulated in crystal clear distinction.\\n\\n Jonesy did a small victory pump and motioned for me to follow him. We got near his parent\u0027s car. I glanced behind me and Dad extended his trust, shooing me off. Mom looked like she was holding back from barfing.\\n\\n Jonesy\u0027s car of the day was his dad\u0027s four wheel drive. Jonesy rooted around, tossing Micah\u0027s car seat in the back, while I tried not to think of Jade... or Gramps... or John. \"I hate all this baby shit!\" he muttered, chucking a bunch of pacifiers and other crap in the back.\\n\\n \"There!\" he said, sliding in. I ripped around the back and found the door being opened for me.\\n\\n Clyde said, \"We will finish this, young Master.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Caleb,\" I corrected automatically.\\n\\n Clyde shook his head. \"Today it is not. Today we work together as necromancer and prodigy.\"\\n\\n I took shotgun and Clyde hung between us, his arms hanging over the back of the seat between us. I felt his light suction of death energy right off the top of what leaked from me constantly. Didn\u0027t even make a dent. I was a geyser of death.\\n\\n Jonesy pulled away in the muck of the weather that covered the roadway just as unmarked vehicles drove into the carnage of the Weller home. I watched Dad take charge of the scene, stalling.\\n\\n I knew my friends were scattering to the four corners of the world and turned around, my back to the scene.\\n\\n Jade, my mind said her name just once. It was enough. I put my hands to my skull and wanted to crush the thoughts out of it or scream... or both.\\n\\n Instead I asked, \"What\u0027s the plan?\"\\n\\n Jonesy grinned and I wanted to pop him. This was not the time for humor, with my girlfriend missing and... Tiff. John wasn\u0027t here to help her and from what I could tell back there, there\u0027d been a beat down on John. It didn\u0027t take a brain surgeon to figure out that he\u0027d been the only one left standing after Frazier\u0027s mass sleep command. John was too powerful a Null to succumb. So he\u0027d fought for Jade.\\n\\n And lost.\\n\\n Kinda like losing the battle of consciousness I had. It was the most frustrating thing in the world: I could command the dead but couldn\u0027t do anything with a Manipulator, he\u0027d made me fall asleep while he ripped Jade away from me.\\n\\n My guilt wouldn\u0027t help her now. I needed to stay out of my head.\\n\\n Jonesy\u0027s smile grew on his dark face. Those nearly black eyes glanced away from the road for a moment. \"First, I think I know how to get that fucktard, Hamilton.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help it, as grim as things were, I laughed and Clyde frowned. I explained.\\n\\n Clyde scowled. He hated foul language but sometimes, there was no substitute. Like now.\\n\\n \"What about Frazier?\" I asked. I knew time was running out for Jade.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m working on that. I think I\u0027ll lump him in with Hamilton,\" Jonesy said, feigning deep contemplation as I heard Clyde grunt in the background.\\n\\n \"How?\" I asked.\\n\\n Jonesy busted out laughing as we neared a place I knew well.\\n\\n \"Fucktards \u0027R Us,\" Jonesy said.\\n\\n Nice.\\n\\n Clyde asked, \"Is there a point to all this profanity?\" he asked with the thinnest edge of irritation.\\n\\n Jonesy was silent for a heartbeat then said, \"Not really.\" Then shrugged. Clyde sighed.\\n\\n We pulled up to a place I never thought I\u0027d visit again.\\n\\n Jonesy smiled and tapped his temple.\\n\\n \"S.M.R.T, Hart?\"\\n\\n \"Smart?\" I guessed.\\n\\n \"Hell yeah!\"\\n\\n We got out quietly and looked at the dirt road that led to the old Clemens Graveyard.\\n\\n Jade\\n\\n It was the jostling that woke her. Or maybe her face being on fire, a throbbing pulse of agony. Her arms flopped against the back of someone.\\n\\n Holy shit, she remembered, Howie Frazier.\\n\\n He immediately noticed her weight shift from dead to live and whipped her over his shoulder and set her on her feet.\\n\\n Tiff had taught her one defense move she\u0027d learned in class.\\n\\n Avoidance.\\n\\n Jade executed the smartest move she\u0027d ever made. Ignoring her fear, and choosing not to run in natural reaction, she used her elbow, ramming it into Frazier\u0027s balls in a jab that was perfectly centered, an absolutely lucky strike.\\n\\n Then she plugged her ears and ran, her elbows sticking out like wings as she took flight through the woods, branches tearing at her arms like grasping fingers.\\n\\n Jade heard him hollering something but because she\u0027d jammed her fingers in her ears, it fell on her as if she were deaf.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t Manipulate her if she couldn\u0027t hear him.\\n\\n She ran, trying to recognize a landmark that would bring her to safety and seeing nothing, Jade ran harder, her lungs beginning to burn.\\n\\n Jade would get away.\\n\\n In her mind, she let out a distress cry for Caleb. She hoped that somehow, their connection would allow him to hear her.\\n\\n It was her last hope if she couldn\u0027t find help before Frazier found her again.\\n\\n She\u0027d be aware of everything he did to her.\\n\\n Or made her do to him.\\n\\n Not wanting to but unable to stop it.\\n\\n Jade shivered as she ran, slipping on the slushy ground, her thumbs popping out of her ears.\\n\\n She shoved them back in like wayward corks, robbing herself of one of the best senses to hear the approach of an enemy.\\n\\n Jade\u0027s soul trembled with the urgency of the call, its loud and shrill echo leaving her, seeking the recipient in a blind leap of faith and desperation.\\n\\n She sent her silent psychic message like an arrow without a target and prayed as she ran.\\n\\n CHAPTER 16\\n\\n choice\\n\\n the journalist\\n\\n Tim Anderson strode back and forth, then paused, looked at the oddball pair who had come to him and began pacing again.\\n\\n Finally he stopped, his hands on his hips.\\n\\n \"I could lose my job,\" he stated.\\n\\n Christopher and Amanda just looked at him. Then Amanda said, \"We came to you because we thought you\u0027d give more of a shit about what was going down.\" She rubbed her nose in agitation, her short shock of brown hair trembling with the movement.\\n\\n \"And the story, of course,\" came the jaded response from Christopher, her antitheses; with his long blond hair, tied in a tight ponytail at the nape of a thick neck.\\n\\n Tim raked a hand through his hair back and forth for a few strung out and tense moments then answered, \"I\u0027d sure like to refute that.\"\\n\\n Christopher crossed his beefy arms across a chest muscled from stylized military training and smiled, a touch cruelly, \"You can\u0027t though. So, given your lust for The Story, coupled with the sheer control by this organization...\"\\n\\n Tim raised his eyes to the male part of the duo. \"Do you know their real name?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Christopher said, shrugging as he lifted his own precious pulse-coded crystal slide, the best conductor of information available. Glass was the perfect conduit for Brain Impulse Technology. The slides were coded and embedded for thumb security.\\n\\n Christopher knew his way around that and slipped the thin and perfectly formed synthetic skin sheathing over his thumb. The DNA facsimile rose to the surface in a frosted white etch when he pressed it on the slide.\\n\\n \"Holy shit,\" Anderson said, awed.\\n\\n Amanda nodded. \"Isn\u0027t that nifty as fuck? Everything\u0027s there. It\u0027ll blow them out of the water....\"\\n\\n Tim glanced at her, tough girl, he thought. \"Tell me. Tell me who they really are,\" Tim demanded of Christopher. \"I know that \u0027Graysheets\u0027 was a code name adopted by those who didn\u0027t know, could only guess at their motivation.\"\\n\\n \"Insiders know,\" Amanda said cryptically, looking like she\u0027d be right at home with a cigarette jammed between her teeth. But she wasn\u0027t a smoker, Amanda was a Telekinetic. Her mundane partner was just as lethal, but for different reasons.\\n\\n Anderson trained his eyes on Christopher, his stare compelling answers.\\n\\n \"The Helix Complex,\" Christopher responded.\\n\\n That made all kinds of sense to Anderson. Of course it would be short, inherently readable with what it pertained to, and with a paradoxical twist.\\n\\n Christopher pushed the crystal slide across the table towards Tim Anderson. The emblazoned symbol of twisted DNA was a deeply etched pattern of permission. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unrequited-death-death-6/page-21.html","bookId":2494,"book":{"id":2494,"title":"Unrequited Death (Death #6)","description":"Storyline: Unrequited Death (Death #6) \\n The Graysheets remain ominously quiet during the teen\u0027s senior year.
