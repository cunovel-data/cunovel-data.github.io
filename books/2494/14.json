Ya old asshole... I\u0027m supposed to call back my dead things,\" she crooned to the zombies that flanked her like faithful suitors, \"because you say so? Ha!\" She threw back her head laughing. \"No, I think not.\"\n \"You obviously missed many a paddling,\" Gramps said thoughtfully. \"Parker?\"\n I watched Parker\u0027s ghost of a smile come over his face. \"Yes, sir?\"\n Gramps nodded at what he considered a proper response. \"Clean up this mess so I can get Caleb\u0027s car out of here.\" He looked at Jonesy and Bry. \"Help your sister, Mr. Weller.\"\n \"Nah, Mac... I don\u0027t like those zombie creepers.\"\n \"Geez, man-up, Weller,\" Jonesy said, giving him a look.\n \"Yeah, I will with living opponents,\" Bry said with a look of disgust, his sister\u0027s hand covered in zombie goop.\n \"Eff it,\" Tiff said, wiping off the zombie trail on the girl. It shone like slug slime.\n \"What are you... who do you think you are?\" she half-cried, the zombie stew on her clothes. Tiff smirked, \"I\u0027m Tiff, you sissy girl.\"\n She glared at Tiff. Tiff glared back, putting a finger in her chest and pushing her. \"Call off the horde, ya stupid twit before I sick Parker and Hart on ya.\"\n She knocked Tiff\u0027s finger away as a zombie got into Tiff\u0027s face and hissed.\n \"I knew who was here,\" she said. \"It\u0027s not like he\u0027s subtle as shit or something.\" She looked straight at me.\n Huh.\n \"He raised a damn chicken coop putting his zombie pet back together.\"\n I shifted my eyes to hers. \"That was you?\" I asked, remembering the figure off in the distance.\n \"Yeah, Sherlock Holmes.\"\n I scowled and Jade giggled. I thought she was mildly traitorous.\n \"Wonderful, let\u0027s hide the cars,\" Gramps prompted.\n \"I guess I won\u0027t kill you today,\" she said.\n \"You won\u0027t even come close... Nevaeh,\" Parker said.\n She flashed those oceanic eyes to his, widening them in alarm when he lifted a pulse-activated gun, his aim steady, his hold one of practiced ease.\n \"Whoa, Parker. Settle down ya stroke!\" Jonesy said.\n \"Don\u0027t kill the filly for lack of manners, Parker,\" Gramps growled.\n \"Yeah... don\u0027t kill her,\" Tiff said in an unconvincing drawl.\n Nice.\n \"Parker?\" I asked.\n \"I have my orders. She\u0027s a renegade C-M.\" His thumb moved over the pulse pad of the hammer.\n \"Don\u0027t,\" Bry said as her eyes widened.\n He plugged her in the upper chest and Jade screamed, the mood going from contained chaos to shreds in a second.\n Gramps went for Parker.\n \"Don\u0027t, Mac!\" Parker yelled, blocking the first numbing punch.\n \"Gramps!\" I said, figuring out what Parker had done.\n He swung his face to mine. \"He knocked her out is all.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you say so then, punk?\"\n Parker laughed, rubbing his forearm that had blocked a hard strike.\n Bet it hurt like a bitch on steroids.\n \"Because, we need to subdue her dead, get the cars off the road... and lastly, I need to know why our organization wants her dead.\"\n I could think of a few reasons but Tiff brought it up first in her special way.\n \"It\u0027s the attitude guys,\" she said, watching the dead stare without their master, the girl laying at their feet. \"She\u0027s a bitch on wheels.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Jonesy agreed.\n I didn\u0027t let my relief at Parker showing up stop me from getting my car pulsed on and moved into a dirt road that carved its way through the woods bordering a back road in Kent that only old timers knew about. And my friends, of course.\n Courtesy of Gramps.\n So this was the stranger I\u0027d seen off in the distance. Parker was okay, still working for the Graysheets (somehow) and killing this C-M was his mission. For reasons unknown even to him. But he hadn\u0027t killed her, instead he\u0027d disobeyed orders to satisfy his curiosity. Interesting.\n I still wanted to know what the prick Zondorae brothers were up to.\n No good, I was betting. They were consistent as hell.\n Parker and I worked on the small horde while the bear looked on, mewling above the girl that lay on the ground, dosed with enough tranquilizer to lay out an elephant.\n Perfect.\n \"Did you think I\u0027d kill her?\" Parker asked me quietly as the dead and their stink melted back into the forest while he easily put them to rest.\n I didn\u0027t respond.\n He looked at me. \"I\u0027m trying, Caleb. It\u0027s a real reversal for me.\"\n \"I know,\" I said.\n \"It may bite me in the ass. The Graysheets always have reasons for the missions they want me to accomplish for them.\"\n \"Then why didn\u0027t you go through with it?\" I asked as my friends and girlfriend assembled next to the vehicles.\n \"Because I think there\u0027s something about this mission that is final. I can\u0027t put my finger on it but I think they\u0027ll be putting me out to pasture soon.\"\n That sounded bad. It was an expression Gramps used but I think the context of this was different. A pasture that didn\u0027t see the living, only the dead.\n He searched my face. Finally, reading things correctly he nodded and pointed to the unconscious girl. \"She\u0027s a threat and we need to know why.\"\n \"Because?\"\n \"Survival,\" Parker said simply. I shoved my will into the bear and it gave a plaintive wail. I watched it lumber to the side of the road where it melted beneath the road\u0027s shoulder.\n I waited.\n \"Ours,\" he added, not that I\u0027d needed the clarification.\n Yeah, I got that. Us AFTDs were magnets to each other, whether we liked it or not.\n Tiff toed the girl as she lay there. \"Gawd, she\u0027s a raging bitch.\"\n Bry and I looked at each other and her eyes narrowed on us.\n Parker smiled. \"Bitch or not, she has some explaining to do.\"\n Gramps broke in. \"Well.\" He looked at the group. \"Let\u0027s throw her in the trunk here.\" He rapped his knuckles on the dented spoiler of my Camaro. \"And reconvene at my humble abode.\"\n \"That\u0027s creepy!\" Jade cried, affronted. \"She can\u0027t be put in the trunk. Gawd!\" She looked from me to Parker.\n \"She\u0027ll be alright, sweetheart,\" Gramps said by way of soothing.\n \"I like it,\" Tiff said. \"It\u0027ll be very disorienting for her to do the dose of dead from the trunk.\"\n That was true... but....\n \"Ugh, Tiff, come on,\" Jade pleaded.\n \"Nope, I\u0027m with sis on this one,\" Bry said.\n Parker nodded and under Jade\u0027s disgruntled look, he folded the newest necromancer on the block into the back of the Camaro.\n \"There, that\u0027s done,\" Gramps said, zip tying the trunk to the latch as a pseudo-air hole. He didn\u0027t act as if we\u0027d just loaded a girl into my trunk but instead had finished a commonplace chore.\n \"Let\u0027s high tail it back to my place and put our heads together.\"\n \"I thought all this was calming down,\" Jade said forlornly.\n \"Where\u0027s the fun in that?\" Jonesy asked, waggling his brows.\n Jade rolled her eyes and we piled into the Camaro. I gave a look at Parker.\n \"I\u0027ve got my own ride,\" he said.\n I didn\u0027t ask how.\n Or what.\n CHAPTER 11\n Gramps\u0027 driveway looked like a parking lot. Everyone showed up in various stages of post-graduation garb.\n All of us were wary and confused. I was pissed at myself because I\u0027d become complacent. All it had taken was a few months of calm and suddenly I\u0027d felt like I was home free.\n Not.\n I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d let that happen again.\n Gramps looked at the assembly and sighed. \"Bring out the princess.\"\n Parker went to the trunk and popped it. I knew what had happened before I saw his face in profile. \"She\u0027s gone, Mr. O\u0027Brien.\"\n \"Mac,\" Gramps responded absent-mindedly. \"Well, isn\u0027t that interesting.\"\n Parker narrowed his eyes, looking around. He scanned the yard then looked at me. \"No way she escaped in the fifteen minutes we\u0027ve been here.\" Then he gave me a significant glance. \"I think she had help.\"\n \"Okay,\" Sophie said, swinging a platform stiletto pump back and forth on her crossed knee. \"Let me get ahold of this latest disaster.\"\n I frowned at her wording but the group went with it so I figured it was fairly accurate. Not that I accepted that.\n \"You picked up skank-ho necromancer...\" She ticked it off on her finger and Tiff agreed, \"Yeah.\" Sophie nodded, continuing, \"and Parker,\" she looked at Parker who stood with his arms folded over a muscular but lean frame, \"was supposed to pop her.\"\n Parker sighed and I smiled.\n Sophie shrugged at his dislike of her verbal rendition of events but he couldn\u0027t deny it. It\u0027d be splitting hairs as Gramps would say.\n \"Now she\u0027s gone poof and you\u0027re crying over that? I say good riddance. Didn\u0027t she bust up the Camaro with a dead bear?\" Her eyes went to my face.\n Well yeah but... \"She\u0027s some kind of answer for Parker.\"\n \"Oh, I understand: he needs her to fill in the blanks,\" Sophie said, half in question.\n \"Do you ever consider when you\u0027ll outlive your usefulness?\" Lewis asked Parker suddenly.\n Parker drilled Archer with a look. \"Every day.\"\n Gramps put up his palms. \"Can\u0027t you guys... feel her or something?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I said.\n \"No,\" Parker said. We looked at each other.\n \"Which is it?\" Gramps asked, plugging his hands on the hips of his perfectly pressed slacks.\n \"I could feel her if she were close by,\" I said.\n \"I can\u0027t so she\u0027s not,\" Parker said simply.\n \"Right,\" Bry said with Mia on his knee. \"Who\u0027d take her then, guys?\" he asked, scrubbing the shadow of hair that grew on his head.\n \"Hey!\" Jonesy spurted randomly. \"You didn\u0027t get your ass kicked this time Weller.\"\n Bry grinned.\n \"There\u0027s time,\" Alex said like the naysayer he was.\n Bry frowned at him and Alex laughed, spreading his palms in a defensive sweep. \"Just sayin\u0027....\"\n \"Don\u0027t, babe,\" Randi said, pinching his leg with her fingers. \"Ouch!\" He smiled down at her. \"Don\u0027t abuse me, ya dominatrix.\"\n We all looked at him and he smiled while Randi blushed.\n Jade giggled. We were definitely not the ones that everyone was noticing anymore.\n \"Interesting choice of words, Mr. Sims,\" Gramps said.\n Randi was dying.\n \"I think Zondorae weaseled in here and nabbed her,\" Parker said suddenly.\n I swung to face him. \"Why? Weren\u0027t you supposed to ...?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"Then...\"\n \"They\u0027re getting him out of the way. Classic deflection,\" John said and Tiff clasped her hand in his.\n It\u0027s the only time I saw Tiff soft. When she looked at Terran. He could do no wrong. It was like his timing in that fateful moment in the hall had been providence.\n \"Do we have to figure out where she went? She was a pain in my ass,\" Tiff reiterated and John smiled. I thought he\u0027d shown real restraint, letting her take on the zombie horde earlier. Of course he\u0027d shown up to late to halt the momentum.\n Gramps laughed. \"Yes well, be that as it may, she had some answers that Parker thought might shed light on our circumstance.\"\n \"Huh,\" Tiff said, disgruntled.\n \"What\u0027s going on now?\" Mia asked innocently.\n Parker hung his head and I came instantly on point. I knew news was coming and usually that meant it sucked donkey dick.\n He met my eyes and said to the group at large, letting the proverbial cat out of the bag, \"The Graysheets,\" he said with airquotes, \"have decided to go with plan B.\"\n \"Right... and....?\" John prompted.\n \"They bit off more than they can chew so they will reverse the power base.\"\n Gramps\u0027 eyes narrowed. \"Whose?\"\n \"Theirs,\" Parker said with a slight frown.\n \"They\u0027re going to strip us,\" Archer surmised instantly and I nodded.\n Parker gave a nod of assent.\n \"How?\" John asked.\n Parker\u0027s eyes found mine and I got it right away, the conduit of my understanding sliding immediately to Jade. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unrequited-death-death-6/page-14.html","bookId":2494,"book":{"id":2494,"title":"Unrequited Death (Death #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Unrequited Death (Death #6) \n The Graysheets remain ominously quiet during the teen\u0027s senior year.
