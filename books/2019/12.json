Namarti was obviously unable to sit still under the driving force of the violence of his passion.\n Andorin thought: He\u0027s not the brightest man in the Empire or even in the movement, not the shrewdest, certainly not the most capable of rational thought. He has to be held back constantly-but he\u0027s driven as none of the rest of us are. We would give up, let go, but he won\u0027t. Push, pull, prod, kick. Well, maybe we need someone like that. We must have someone like that or nothing will ever happen.\n Namarti stopped, as though he felt Andorin\u0027s eyes boring into his back. He turned around and said, \"If you\u0027re going to lecture me again on Kaspalov, don\u0027t bother.\"\n Andorin shrugged lightly. \"Why bother lecturing you? The deed is done. The harm-if any-has been done.\"\n \"What harm, Andorin? What harm? If I had not done it, then we would have been harmed. The man was on the edge of being a traitor. Within a month, he would have gone running \"\n \"I know. I was there. I heard what he said.\"\n \"Then you understand there was no choice. No choice. You don\u0027t think I liked to have an old comrade killed, do you? I had no choice.\"\n \"Very well. You had no choice.\"\n Namarti resumed his tramping, then turned again. \"Andorin, do you believe in gods?\"\n Andorin stared, \"In what?\"\n \"In gods.\"\n \"I never heard the word. What is it?\"\n Namarti said, \"It\u0027s not Galactic Standard. Supernatural influences. How\u0027s that?\"\n \"Oh, supernatural influences. Why didn\u0027t you say so? No, I don\u0027t believe in that sort of thing. By definition, something is supernatural if it exists outside the laws of nature and nothing exists outside the laws of nature. Are you turning into a mystic?\" Andorin asked it as though he were joking, but his eyes narrowed with sudden concern.\n Namarti stared him down. Those blazing eyes of his could stare anyone down. \"Don\u0027t be a fool. I\u0027ve been reading about it. Trillions of people believe in supernatural influences.\"\n \"I know,\" said Andorin. \"They always have.\"\n \"They\u0027ve done so since before the beginning of history. The word \u0027gods\u0027 is of unknown origin. It is, apparently, a hangover from some primeval language of which no trace any longer exists, except that word. Do you know how many different varieties of beliefs there are in various kinds of gods?\"\n \"Approximately as many as the varieties of fools among the Galactic population, I should say.\"\n Namarti ignored that. \"Some people think the word dates back to the time when all humanity existed on but a single world.\"\n \"Itself a mythological concept. That\u0027s just as lunatic as the notion of supernatural influences. There never was one original human world.\"\n \"There would have to be, Andorin,\" said Namarti, annoyed. \"Human beings can\u0027t have evolved on different worlds and ended as a single species.\"\n \"Even so, there\u0027s no effective human world. It can\u0027t be located, it can\u0027t he defined, so it can\u0027t be spoken of sensibly, so it effectively doesn\u0027t exist.\"\n \"These gods,\" said Namarti, continuing to follow his own line of thought, \"are supposed to protect humanity and keep it safe or at least to care for those portions of humanity that know how to make use of the gods. At a time when there was only one human world, it makes sense to suppose they would be particularly interested in caring for that one tiny world with a few people. They would care for such a world as though they were big brothers-or parents.\"\n \"Very nice of them. I\u0027d like to see them try to handle the entire Empire.\"\n \"What if they could? What if they were infinite?\"\n \"What if the Sun were frozen? What\u0027s the use of \u0027what if?\"\n \"I\u0027m just speculating. Just thinking. Haven\u0027t you ever let your mind wander freely? Do you always keep everything on a leash?\"\n \"I should imagine that\u0027s the safest way, keeping it on a leash. What does your wandering mind tell you, Chief?\"\n Namarti\u0027s eyes flashed at the other, as though he suspected sarcasm, but Andorin\u0027s face remained good-natured and blank.\n Namarti said, \"What my mind is telling me is this-If there are gods, they must be on our side.\"\n \"Wonderful-if true. Where\u0027s the evidence?\"\n \"Evidence? Without the gods, it would just be a coincidence, I suppose, but a very useful one.\" Suddenly Namarti yawned and sat down, looking exhausted.\n Good, thought Andorin. His galloping mind has finally wound itself down and he may talk sense now.\n \"This matter of internal breakdown of the infrastructure-\" said Namarti, his voice distinctly lower.\n Andorin interrupted. \"You know, Chief, Kaspalov was not entirely wrong about this. The longer we keep it up, the greater the chance that Imperial forces will discover the cause. The whole program must, sooner or later, explode in our faces.\"\n \"Not yet. So far, everything is exploding in the Imperial face. The unrest on Trantor is something I can feel.\" He raised his hands, rubbing his fingers together. \"I can feel it. And we are almost through. We are ready for the next step.\"\n Andorin smiled humorlessly. \"I\u0027m not asking for details, Chief. Kaspalov did and look where that got him. I am not Kaspalov.\"\n \"It\u0027s precisely because you\u0027re not Kaspalov that I can tell you. And because I know something now I didn\u0027t then.\"\n \"I presume,\" said Andorin, only half-believing what he was saying, \"that you intend a strike on the Imperial Palace grounds.\"\n Namarti looked up. \"Of course. What else is there to do? The problem, however, is how to penetrate the grounds effectively. I have my sources of information there, but they are only spies. I\u0027ll need men of action on the spot.\"\n \"To get men of action into the most heavily guarded region in all the galaxy will not be easy.\"\n \"Of course not. That\u0027s what has been giving me an unbearable headache till now-and then the gods intervened.\"\n Andorin said gently (it was taking all his self-restraint to keep from showing his disgust), \"I don\u0027t think we need a metaphysical discussion. What has happened-leaving the gods to one side?\"\n \"My information is that His Gracious and Ever to Be Beloved Emperor Cleon I has decided to appoint a new Chief Gardener. This is the first new appointee in nearly a quarter of a century.\"\n \"And if so?\"\n \"Do you see no significance?\"\n Andorin thought for a moment. \"I am not a favorite of your gods. I don\u0027t see any significance.\"\n \"If you have a new Chief Gardener, Andorin, the situation is the same as having a new administrator of any other type-the same as if you had a new First Minister or a new Emperor. The new Chief Gardener will certainly want his own staff. He will force into retirement what he considers dead wood and will hire younger gardeners by the hundreds.\"\n \"That\u0027s possible.\"\n \"It\u0027s more than possible. It\u0027s certain. Exactly that happened when the present Chief Gardener was appointed and the same when his predecessor was appointed and so on. Hundreds of strangers from the Outer Worlds-\"\n \"Why from the Outer Worlds?\"\n \"Use your brains-if you have any, Andorin. What do Trantorians know about gardening when they\u0027ve lived under domes all their lives, tending potted plants, zoos, and carefully arranged crops of grains and fruit trees? What do they know about life in the wild?\"\n \"Ahhh. Now I understand.\"\n \"So there will be these strangers flooding the grounds. They will be carefully checked, I presume, but they won\u0027t be as tightly screened as they would be if they were Trantorians. And that means, surely, that we should be able to supply just a few of our own people, with false identifications, and get them inside. Even if some are screened out, a few might make it-a few must make it. Our people will enter, despite the supertight security established since the failed coup in the early days of First Minister Seldon.\" (He virtually spat out the name, as he always did.) \"We\u0027ll finally have our chance.\"\n Now it was Andorin who felt dizzy, as if he\u0027d fallen into a spinning vortex. \"It seems odd for me to say so, Chief, but there is something to this \u0027gods\u0027 business after all, because I have been waiting to tell you something that I now see fits in perfectly.\"\n Namarti stared at the other suspiciously and looked around the room, as though he suddenly feared for security. But such fear was groundless. The room was located deep in an old-fashioned residential complex and was well shielded. No one could overhear and no one, even with detailed directions, could find it easily-nor get through the layers of protection provided by loyal members of the organization.\n Namarti said, \"What are you talking about?\"\n \"I\u0027ve found a man for you. A young man-very naive. A quite likable fellow, the kind you feel you can trust as soon as you see him. He\u0027s got an open face, wide-open eyes; he\u0027s lived in Dahl; he\u0027s an enthusiast for equality; he thinks Joranum was the greatest thing since Dahlite cokeicers; and I\u0027m sure we can easily talk him into doing anything for the cause.\"\n \"For the cause?\" said Namarti, whose suspicions were not in the least alleviated. \"Is he one of us?\"\n \"Actually, he\u0027s not one of anything. He\u0027s got some vague notions in his head that Joranum wanted sector equality.\"\n \"That was his lure. Sure.\"\n \"It\u0027s ours, too, but the kid believes it. He talks about equality and popular participation in government. He even mentioned democracy.\"\n Namarti snickered. \"In twenty thousand years, democracy has never been used for very long without falling apart.\"\n \"Yes, but that\u0027s not our concern. It\u0027s what drives the young man and I tell you, Chief, I knew we had our tool just about the moment I saw him, but I didn\u0027t know how we could possibly use him. Now I know. We can get him onto the Imperial Palace grounds as a gardener.\"\n \"How? Does he know anything about gardening?\"\n \"No. I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t. He\u0027s never worked at anything but unskilled labor. He\u0027s operating a hauler right now and I think that he had to be taught how to do that. Still, if we can get him in as a gardener\u0027s helper, if he just knows how to hold a pair of shears, then we\u0027ve got it.\"\n \"Got what?\"\n \"Got someone who can approach anyone we wish-and do so without raising the flutter of a suspicion-and get close enough to strike. I\u0027m telling you he simply exudes a kind of honorable stupidity, a kind of foolish virtue that inspires confidence.\"\n \"And he\u0027ll do what we tell him to do?\"\n \"Absolutely.\"\n \"How did you meet this person?\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t I. It was Manella who really spotted him.\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"Manella. Manella Dubanqua.\"\n \"Oh. That friend of yours.\" Namarti\u0027s face twisted into a look of prissy disapproval.\n \"She\u0027s the friend of many people,\" said Andorin tolerantly. \"That\u0027s one of the things that makes her so useful. She can weigh a man quickly and with very little to go on. She talked to this fellow because she was attracted to him at sight-and I assure you that Manella is not one who is usually attracted by anything but the bottom line-so, you see, this man is rather unusual. She talked to this fellow-his name is Planchet, by the way-and then told me, \u0027I have a live one for you, Gleb.\u0027 I\u0027ll trust her on the matter of live ones any day of the week.\"\n Namarti said slyly, \"And what do you think this wonderful tool of yours would do once he had the run of the grounds, eh, Andorin?\"\n Andorin took a deep breath. \"What else? If we do everything right, he will dispose of our dear Emperor Cleon, First of that Name, for us.\"\n Namarti\u0027s face blazed into anger. \"What? Are you mad? Why should we want to kill Cleon? He\u0027s our hold on the government. He\u0027s the facade behind which we can rule. He\u0027s our passport to legitimacy. Where are your brains? We need him as a figurehead. He won\u0027t interfere with us and we\u0027ll be stronger for his existence.\"\n Andorin\u0027s fair face turned blotchy red and his good humor finally exploded. \"What do you have in mind, then? What are you planning? I\u0027m getting tired of always having to second-guess.\"\n Namarti raised his hand. \"All right. All right. Calm down. I meant no harm. But think a bit, will you? Who destroyed Joranum? Who destroyed our hopes ten years ago? It was that mathematician. And it is he who rules the Empire now with his idiotic talk about psychohistory. Cleon is nothing. It is Hari Seldon we must destroy. It is Hari Seldon whom I\u0027ve been turning into an object of ridicule with these constant breakdowns. The miseries they entail are placed at his doorstep. It is all being interpreted as his inefficiency, his incapacity.\" There was a trace of spittle in the corners of Namarti\u0027s mouth. \"When he\u0027s cut down, there will be a cheer from the Empire that will drown out every holovision report for hours. It won\u0027t even matter if they know who did it.\" He raised his hand and let it drop, as if he were plunging a knife into someone\u0027s heart. \"We will be looked upon as heroes of the Empire, as saviors. Eh? Eh? Do you think your youngster can cut down Hari Seldon?\"\n Andorin had recovered his sense of equanimity-at least outwardly.\n \"I\u0027m sure he would,\" he said with forced lightness. \"For Cleon, he might have some respect; the Emperor has a mystical aura about him, as you know.\" (He stressed the \"you\" faintly and Namarti scowled.) \"He would have no such feelings about Seldon.\"\n Inwardly, however, Andorin was furious. This was not what he wanted. He was being betrayed.\n 14\n Manella brushed the hair out of her eyes and smiled up at Raych. \"I told you it wouldn\u0027t cost you any credits.\"\n Raych blinked and scratched at his bare shoulder. \"But are you going to ask me for some now?\"\n She shrugged and smiled rather impishly. \"Why should I?\"\n \"Why shouldn\u0027t you?\"\n \"Because I\u0027m allowed to take my own pleasure sometimes.\"\n \"With me?\"\n \"There\u0027s no one else here.\"\n There was a long pause and then Manella said soothingly, \"Besides, you don\u0027t have that many credits anyway. How\u0027s the job?\"\n Raych said, \"Ain\u0027t much but better than nothing. Lots better. Did you tell that guy to get me one?\"\n Manella shook her head slowly. \"You mean Gleb Andorin? I didn\u0027t tell him to do anything. I just said he might be interested in you.\"\n \"Is he going to be annoyed because you and I-\"\n \"Why should he? None of his business. And none of yours, either.\"\n \"What\u0027s he do? I mean, what does he work at?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think he works at anything. He\u0027s rich. He\u0027s a relative of the old Mayors.\"\n \"Of Wye?\"\n \"Right. He doesn\u0027t like the Imperial government. None of those old Mayor people do. He says Cleon should-\"\n She stopped suddenly and said, \"I\u0027m talking too much. Don\u0027t you go repeating anything I say.\"\n \"Me? I ain\u0027t heard you say nothing at all. And I ain\u0027t going to.\"\n \"All right.\"\n \"But what about Andorin? Is he high up in Joranumite business? Is he an important guy there?\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know.\"\n \"Don\u0027t he ever talk about that kind of stuff?\"\n \"Not to me.\"\n \"Oh,\" said Raych, trying not to sound annoyed.\n Manella looked at him shrewdly. \"Why are you so interested?\"\n \"I want to get in with them. I figure I\u0027ll get higher up that way. Better job. More credits. You know.\"\n \"Maybe Andorin will help you. He likes you. I know that much.\"\n \"Could you make him like me more?\"\n \"I can try. I don\u0027t know why he shouldn\u0027t. I like you. I like you more than I like him.\"\n \"Thank you, Manella. I like you, too. A lot.\" He ran his hand down the side of her body and wished ardently that he could concentrate more on her and less on his assignment.\n 15\n \"Gleb Andorin,\" said Hari Seldon wearily, rubbing his eyes.\n \"And who is he?\" asked Dors Venabili, her mood as cold as it had teen every day since Raych had left.\n \"Until a few days ago I never heard of him,\" said Seldon. \"That\u0027s the trouble with trying to run a world of forty billion people. You never hear of anyone, except for the few who obtrude themselves on your notice. With all the computerized information in the world, Trantor remains a planet of anonymities. We can drag up people with their reference numbers and their statistics, but whom do we drag up? Add twenty-five million Outer Worlds and the wonder is that the Galactic Empire has remained a working phenomenon for all these millennia. Frankly I think it has existed only because it very largely runs itself. And now it is finally running down.\"\n \"So much for philosophizing, Hari,\" said Dors. \"Who is this Andorin?\"\n \"Someone I admit I ought to have known about. I managed to cajole the security establishment into calling up some files on him. He\u0027s a member of the Wyan Mayoralty family-the most prominent member, in fact-so the security people have kept tabs on him. They think he has ambitions but is too much of a playboy to do anything about them.\"\n \"And is he involved with the Joranumites?\"\n Seldon made an uncertain gesture. \"I\u0027m under the impression that the security establishment knows nothing about the Joranumites. That may mean that the Joranumites no longer exist or that, if they do, they are of no importance. It may also mean that the security establishment just isn\u0027t interested. Nor is there any way in which I can force it to be interested. I\u0027m only thankful the officers give me any information at all. And I am the First Minister.\"\n \"Is it possible that you\u0027re not a very good First Minister?\" said Dors, dryly.\n \"That\u0027s more than possible. It\u0027s probably been generations since there\u0027s been an appointee less suited to the job than myself. But that has nothing to do with the security establishment. It\u0027s a totally independent arm of the government. I doubt that Cleon himself knows much about it, though, in theory, the security officers are supposed to report to him through their director. Believe me, if we only knew more about the security establishment, we\u0027d be trying to stick its actions into our psychohistorical equations, such as they are.\"\n \"Are the security officers on our side, at least?\"\n \"I believe so, but I can\u0027t swear to it.\"\n \"And why are you interested in this what\u0027s-his-name?\"\n \"Gleb Andorin. Because I received a roundabout message from Raych.\"\n Dors\u0027s eyes flashed. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me? Is he all right?\"\n \"As far as I know, but I hope he doesn\u0027t try any further messages. If he\u0027s caught communicating, he won\u0027t be all right. In any case, he has made contact with Andorin.\"\n \"And the Joranumites, too?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so. It would sound unlikely, for the connection is not something that would make sense. The Joranumite movement is predominantly lower-class-a proletarian movement, so to speak. And Andorin is an aristocrat of aristocrats. What would he be doing with the Joranumites?\"\n \"If he\u0027s of the Wyan Mayoralty family, he might aspire to the Imperial throne, might he not?\"\n \"They\u0027ve been aspiring for generations. You remember Rashelle, I trust. She was Andorin\u0027s aunt.\"\n \"Then he might be using the Joranumites as a stepping-stone, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"If they exist. And if they do-and if a stepping-stone is what Andorin wants-I think he\u0027d find himself playing a dangerous game. The Joranumites-if they exist-would have their own plans and a man like Andorin may find he\u0027s simply riding a greti-\"\n \"What\u0027s a greti?\"\n \"Some extinct animal of a ferocious type, I think. It\u0027s just a proverbial phrase back on Helicon. If you ride a greti, you find you can\u0027t get off, for then it will eat you.\"\n Seldon paused. \"One more thing. Raych seems to be involved with a woman who knows Andorin and through whom, he thinks, he may get important information. I\u0027m telling you this now so that you won\u0027t accuse me afterward of keeping anything from you.\"\n Dors frowned. \"A woman?\"\n \"One, I gather, who knows a great many men who will talk to her unwisely, sometimes, under intimate circumstances.\"\n \"One of those.\" Her frown deepened. \"I don\u0027t like the thought of Raych-\"\n \"Come, come. Raych is thirty years old and undoubtedly has much experience. You can leave this woman-or any woman, I think-safely to Raych\u0027s good sense.\" He turned toward Dors with a look so worn, so weary, and said, \"Do you think I like this? Do you think I like any of this?\"\n And Dors could find nothing to say. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forward-the-foundation-foundation-7/page-12.html","bookId":2019,"book":{"id":2019,"title":"Forward the Foundation (Foundation #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Forward the Foundation (Foundation: Prequel, #2) \n A stunning testament to his creative genius.
