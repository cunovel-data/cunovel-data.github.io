{"id":107427,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"22 \"Mr. Bindris,\" said Hari Seldon, reaching out his hand to shake the other\u0027s. \"I am so glad to be able to see you. It was good of you to agree to see me.\" \"Why not?\" said Terep Bindris jovially. \"I know you well. Or, rather, I know of you well.\" \"That\u0027s pleasant. I take it you\u0027ve heard of psychohistory, then.\" \"Oh yes, what intelligent person hasn\u0027t? Not that I understand anything about it, of course. And who is this young lady you have with you?\" \"My granddaughter, Wanda.\" \"A very pretty young woman.\" He beamed. \"Somehow I feel I\u0027d be putty in her hands.\" Wanda said, \"I think you exaggerate, sir.\" \"No, really. Now, please, sit down and tell me what it is I can do for you.\" He gestured expansively with his arm, indicating that they be seated on two overstuffed, richly brocaded chairs in front of the desk at which he sat. The chairs, like the ornate desk, the imposing carved doors which had slid back noiselessly at their arrival signal, and the gleaming obsidian floor of Bindris\u0027s vast office, were of the finest quality. And, although his surroundings were impressive-and imposing-Bindris himself was not. The slight cordial man would not be taken, at first glance, for one of Trantor\u0027s leading financial powerbrokers. \"We\u0027re here, sir, at the Emperor\u0027s suggestion.\" \"The Emperor?\" \"Yes, he could not help us, but he thought a man like you might be able to do so. The question, of course, is credits.\" Bindris\u0027s face fell. \"Credits?\" he said. \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"Well,\" said Seldon, \"for nearly forty years, psychohistory has been supported by the government. However, times change and the Empire is no longer what it was.\" \"Yes, I know that.\"\u0027 \"The Emperor lacks the credits to support us or, even if he did have the credits, he couldn\u0027t get the request for funding past the Legislature. He recommends, therefore, that I see businesspeople who, in the first place, still have credits and, in the second place, can simply write out a credit voucher.\" There was a longish pause and Bindris finally said, \"The Emperor, I\u0027m afraid, knows nothing about business. -How many credits do you want?\" \"Mr. Bindris, we\u0027re talking about an enormous task. I\u0027m going to need several million.\" \"Several million!\" \"Yes, sir.\" Bindris frowned. \"Are we talking about a loan here? When do you expect to be able to pay it back?\" \"Well, Mr. Bindris, I can\u0027t honestly say I ever expect to be able to pay it back. I\u0027m looking for a gift.\" \"Even if I wanted to give you the credits-and let me tell you, for some strange reason I very much want to do so-I couldn\u0027t. The Emperor may have his Legislature, but I have my Board members. I can\u0027t make a gift of that sort without the Board\u0027s permission and they\u0027ll never grant it.\" \"Why not? Your firm is enormously wealthy. A few million would mean nothing to you.\" \"That sounds good,\" said Bindris, \"but I\u0027m afraid that the firm is in a state of decline right now. Not sufficiently to bring us into serious trouble, but enough to make us unhappy. If the Empire is in a state of decay, different individual parts of it are decaying, too. We are in no position to hand out a few million. I\u0027m truly sorry.\" Seldon sat there silently and Bindris seemed unhappy. He shook his Head at last and said, \"Look, Professor Seldon, I would really like to help you out, particularly for the sake of the young lady you have with you. It just can\u0027t be done. However, we\u0027re not the only firm in Trantor. Try others, Professor. You may have better luck elsewhere.\" \"Well,\" said Seldon, raising himself to his feet with an effort, \"we shall try.\" 23 Wanda\u0027s eyes were filled with tears, but the emotion they represented was not sorrow but fury. \"Grandpa,\" she said, \"I don\u0027t understand it. I simply don\u0027t understand it. We\u0027ve been to four different firms. Each one was ruder and nastier to us than the one before. The fourth one just kicked us out. And since then, no one will let us in.\" \"It\u0027s no mystery, Wanda,\" said Seldon gently. \"When we saw Bindris, he didn\u0027t know what we were there for and he was perfectly friendly until I asked for a gift of a few million credits. Then he was a great deal less friendly. I imagine the word went out as to what we wanted and each additional time there was less friendliness until now, when people won\u0027t receive us at all. Why should they? They\u0027re not going to give us the credits we need, so why waste time with us?\" Wanda\u0027s anger turned on herself. \"And what did I do? I just sat there. Nothing.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t say that,\" said Seldon. \"Bindris was affected by you. It seems to me that he really wanted to give me the credits, largely because of you. You were pushing him and accomplishing something.\" \"Not nearly enough. Besides, all he cared about was that I was pretty.\" \"Not pretty,\" muttered Seldon. \"Beautiful. Very beautiful.\" \"So what do we do now, Grandpa?\" asked Wanda. \"After all these years, psychohistory will collapse.\" \"I suppose that,\" said Seldon \"in a way, it\u0027s something that can\u0027t be helped. I\u0027ve been predicting the breakdown of the Empire for nearly forty years and now that it\u0027s come, psychohistory breaks down with it.\" \"But psychohistory will save the Empire, at least partly.\" \"I know it will, but I can\u0027t force it to.\" \"Are you just going to let it collapse?\" Seldon shook his head. \"I\u0027ll try to keep it from doing so, but I must admit that I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do it.\" Wanda said, \"I\u0027m going to practice. There must be some way I can strengthen my push, make it easier for me to force people to do what I want them to do.\" \"I wish you could manage.\" \"What are you going to do, Grandpa?\" \"Well, nothing much. Two days ago, when I was on my way to see the Chief Librarian, I encountered three men in the Library who were arguing about psychohistory. For some reason, one of them impressed me very much. I urged him to come see me and he agreed. The appointment is for this afternoon at my office.\" \"Are you going to have him work for you?\" \"I would like to-if I have enough credits to pay him with. But it can\u0027t hurt to talk with him. After all, what can I lose?\" 24 The young man arrived at precisely 4 T.S.T. (Trantorian Standard Time) and Seldon smiled. He loved punctual people. He placed his hands on his desk and made ready to heave to his feet, but the young man said, \"Please, Professor, I know you have a bad leg. You needn\u0027t stand up.\" Seldon said, \"Thank you, young man. However, that does not mean that you cannot sit down. Please do.\" The young man removed his jacket and sat down. Seldon said, \"You must forgive me... when we met and set up this appointment, I neglected to learn your name-which is...? \"Stettin Palver,\" said the young man. \"Ah. Palver! Palver! The name sounds familiar.\" \"It should, Professor. My grandfather boasted frequently of having known you.\" \"Your grandfather. Of course. Joramis Palver. He was two years younger than I was, as I recall. I tried to get him to join me in psychohistory, but he refused. He said there was no chance of his ever learning enough mathematics to make it possible. Too bad! How is Joramis, by the way?\" Palver said solemnly, \"I\u0027m afraid that Joramis has gone the way of old men generally. He\u0027s dead.\" Seldon winced. Two years younger than he himself was-and dead. An old friend and they had lost touch to such a degree that, when death came, it did so unknowingly. Seldon sat there for a while and finally muttered, \"I\u0027m sorry.\" The young man shrugged. \"He had a good life.\" \"And you, young man, where did you have your schooling?\" \"Langano University.\" Seldon frowned. \"Langano? Stop me if I\u0027m wrong, but that\u0027s not on Trantor, is it?\" \"No. I wanted to try a different world. The Universities on Trantor, as you undoubtedly know very well, are all overcrowded. I wanted to find a place where I could study in peace.\" \"And what did you study?\" \"Nothing much. History. Not the sort of thing that would lead one to a good job.\" (Another wince, even worse than the first. Dors Venabili had been a historian.) Seldon said, \"But you\u0027re back here on Trantor. Why is that?\" \"Credits. Jobs.\" \"As an historian?\" Palver laughed. \"Not a chance. I run a device that pulls and hauls. Not exactly a professional occupation.\" Seldon looked at Palver with a twinge of envy. The contours of Palver\u0027s arms and chest were highlighted by the thin fabric of his shirt. He was well muscled. Seldon had never himself been quite that muscular. Seldon said, \"I presume that when you were at the University, you were on the boxing team.\" \"Who, me? Never. I\u0027m a Twister.\" \"A Twister!\" Seldon\u0027s spirits jumped. \"Are you from Helicon?\" Palver said with a certain contempt, \"You don\u0027t have to come from Helicon to be a good Twister.\" No, thought Seldon, but that\u0027s where the best ones come from. However, he said nothing. He did say, though, \"Well, your grandfather would not join me. How about you?\" \"Psychohistory?\" \"I heard you talking to the others when I first encountered you and it seemed to me that you were talking quite intelligently about psychohistory. Would you like to join me, then?\" \"As I said, Professor, I have a job.\" \"Pushing and hauling. Come, come.\" \"It pays well.\" \"Credits aren\u0027t everything.\" \"They\u0027re quite a bit. Now you, on the other hand, can\u0027t pay me much. I\u0027m quite certain that you\u0027re short of credits.\" \"Why do you say that?\" \"I\u0027m guessing, in a way, I suppose. But am I wrong?\" Seldon\u0027s lips pressed together hard, then he said, \"No, you\u0027re not wrong and I can\u0027t pay you much. I\u0027m sorry. I suppose that ends our little interview.\" \"Wait, wait, wait.\" Palver held up his hands. \"Not quite so fast, please. We\u0027re still talking about psychohistory. If I work for you, I will be taught psychohistory, right?\" \"Of course.\" \"In that case, credits aren\u0027t everything, after all. I\u0027ll make you a deal. You teach me all the psychohistory you can and you pay me whatever you can and I\u0027ll get by somehow. How about it?\" \"Wonderful,\" said Seldon joyously. \"That sounds great. Now, one more thing.\" \"Oh?\" \"Yes. I\u0027ve been attacked twice in recent weeks. The first time my son came to my defense, but he has since gone to Santanni. The second time I made use of my lead-filled walking stick. It worked, but I was dragged before a magistrate and accused of assault and battery-\" \"Why the attacks?\" interjected Palver. \"I am not popular. I have been preaching the Fall of the Empire for so long that, now that it is coming, I am blamed for it.\" \"I see. Now then, what does all that have to do with the one more thing you mentioned?\" \"I want you to be my bodyguard. You\u0027re young, you\u0027re strong, and, most of all, you\u0027re a Twister. You\u0027re exactly what I need.\" \"I suppose it can be managed,\" Palver said with a smile. 25 \"See there, Stettin,\" Seldon said as the two were taking an early evening stroll in one of Trantor\u0027s residential sectors near Streeling. The older man pointed to debris-assorted refuse jettisoned from passing groundcars or dropped by careless pedestrians-strewn along the walkway. \"In the old days,\" Seldon continued, \"you would never see litter like this. The security officers were vigilant and municipal maintenance crews provided round-the-clock upkeep of all public areas. But, most important, no one would even think of dumping his trash in such a manner. Trantor was our home; we took pride in it. Now\"-Seldon shook his head sadly, resignedly, and sighed-\"it\u0027s-\" He broke off abruptly. \"You there, young man!\" Seldon shouted at a ill-kempt fellow who had moments before passed them, going in the opposite direction. He was munching a treat just popped into his mouth; the wrapper had been tossed to the ground without so much as a downward glance. \"Pick that up and dispose of it properly,\" Seldon admonished as the young man eyed him sullenly. \"Pick it up yourself,\" the boy snarled and then he turned and walked away. \"It\u0027s another sign of society\u0027s breakdown, as predicted by your psychohistory, Professor Seldon,\" Palver said. \"Yes, Stettin. All around us the Empire is falling apart, piece by piece. In fact, it\u0027s already smashed-there\u0027s no turning back now. Apathy, decay, and greed have all played their parts in destroying the once-glorious Empire. And what will take its place? Why-\" Here Seldon broke off at the sight of Palver\u0027s face. The younger man seemed to be listening intently-but not to Seldon\u0027s voice. His head was cocked to one side and his face had a far-off look. It was as if Palver were straining to hear some sound inaudible to everyone but himself. Suddenly he snapped back to the here and now. With an urgent glance around them, Palver took hold of Seldon\u0027s arm. \"Hari, quick, we must get away. They\u0027re coming...\" And then the still evening was broken by the harsh sound of rapidly approaching footsteps. Seldon and Palver spun around, but it was too late; a band of attackers was upon them. This time, however, Hari Seldon was prepared. He immediately swung his cane in a wide arc around Palver and himself. At this, the three attackers-two boys and a girl, all teenage ruffians-laughed. \"So, you\u0027re not goin\u0027 to make it easy, are you, old man?\" snorted the boy who appeared to be the group\u0027s ringleader. \"Why, me and my buddies, we\u0027ll take you out in two seconds flat. We\u0027ll-\" All of a sudden, the ringleader was down, the victim of a perfectly placed Twist-kick to his abdomen. The two ruffians who were still standing quickly dropped to a crouch in preparation for attack. But Palver was quicker. They, too, were felled almost before they knew what hit them. And then it was over-almost as soon as it started. Seldon stood off to the side, leaning heavily on his cane, shaking at the thought of his narrow escape. Palver, panting slightly from exertion, surveyed the scene. The three attackers were out cold on the deserted walkway under the darkening dome. \"Come on, let\u0027s get out of here quickly!\" Palver urged again, only this time it was not the attackers they would be fleeing. \"Stettin, we can\u0027t leave,\" protested Seldon. He gestured toward the unconscious would-be muggers. \"They\u0027re really nothing more than children. They may be dying. How can we just walk away? It\u0027s inhumane-that\u0027s what it is-and humanity is exactly what I\u0027ve been working all these years to protect.\" Seldon struck the ground with his cane for emphasis and his eyes gleamed with conviction. \"Nonsense,\" retorted Palver. \"What\u0027s inhumane is the way muggers like that prey on innocent citizens like you. Do you think they\u0027d have given you a second thought? They\u0027d just as soon stick a knife in your gut to steal your last credit-and then kick you as they ran! They\u0027ll come to soon enough and slink away to lick their wounds. Or someone will find them and call the central office. \"But, Hari, you must think. After what happened last time, you stand to lose everything if you\u0027re linked to another beating. Please, Hari, we must run!\" With this, Palver grabbed Seldon\u0027s arm and Seldon after a List backward glance, allowed himself to be led away. As the footsteps of the rapidly departing Seldon and Palver diminished in the distance, another figure emerged from his hiding place behind some trees. Chuckling to himself, the sullen-eyed youth muttered, \"You\u0027re a fine one to tell me what\u0027s right and what\u0027s wrong, Professor.\" With that, he spun on his heel and headed off to summon the security officers. 26 \"Order! I will have order!\" bellowed Judge Tejan Popjens Lih. The public hearing of Professor Raven Seldon and his young associate, Stettin Palver, had generated a hue and cry among the populace of Trantor. Here was the man who had predicted the Fall of the Empire, the decay of civilization, who exhorted others to harken back to the golden age of civility and order-here was he who, according to an eyewitness, had ordered the brutal beating of three young Trantorians for no apparent provocation. Ah yes, it promised to be a spectacular hearing, one which would lead, no doubt, to an even more spectacular trial. The judge pressed a contact set into a recessed panel on her bench and a sonorous gong resounded through the packed courtroom. \"I will have order,\" she repeated to the now-hushed throng. \"If need be, the courtroom will be cleared. That is a warning. It will not be repeated.\" The judge cut an imposing figure in her scarlet robe. Originally from the Outer World of Lystena, Lih\u0027s complexion had a slight bluish cast, which turned darker when she became exercised, practically purple when she was really angry. It was rumored that, for all her years on the bench, in spite of her reputation as a top judicial mind, notwithstanding her position as one of the most revered interpreters of Imperial law, Lih was ever so slightly vain about the colorful appearance she gave, the way in which the bright red robes set off her soft turquoise skin. Nevertheless, Lih had a reputation for coming down hard on those who brooked Imperial law; she was one of the few judges left who upheld the civil code without wavering. \"I have heard of you, Professor Seldon, and your theories about our imminent destruction. And I have spoken with the magistrate who recently heard another case in which you were involved, one in which you struck a man with your lead-filled cane. In that instance, too, you claimed to be the victim of assault. Your reasoning stemmed, I believe, from a previous unreported incident in which you and your son allegedly were assaulted by eight hoodlums. You were able to convince my esteemed colleague, Professor Seldon of your plea of self-defense, even though an eyewitness testified otherwise. This time, Professor, you will have to be much more convincing.\" The three hoodlums who were bringing charges against Seldon and Palver snickered in their seats at the plaintiff\u0027s table. They presented a much different appearance today than they had the evening of the attack. The young men were sporting clean loose-fitting unisuits; the young lady was wearing a crisply pleated tunic. All in all, if one didn\u0027t look (or listen) too closely, the three presented a reassuring picture of Trantorian youth. Seldon\u0027s lawyer, Civ Novker (who was representing Palver as well), approached the bench. \"Your Honor, my client is an upstanding member of the Trantorian community. He is a former First Minister of stellar repute. He is a personal acquaintance of our Emperor Agis XIV. What possible benefit could Professor Seldon derive from attacking innocent young people? He is one of the most vocal proponents of stimulating the intellectual creativity of Trantorian youth-his Psychohistory Project employs numerous student volunteers; he is a beloved member of the Streeling University faculty. \"Further-\" Here Novker paused, sweeping his gaze around the packed courtroom, as if to say, Wait till you hear this-you\u0027ll be ashamed that you ever for a second doubted the veracity of my client\u0027s claims, \"Professor Seldon is one of the very few private individuals officially allied with the prestigious Galactic Library. He has been granted unlimited use of Library facilities for work on what he calls the Encyclopedia Galactica, a veritable paean to Imperial civilization. \"I ask you, how can this man even be questioned in such a matter?\" With a flourish of his arm, Novker gestured toward Seldon who was sitting at the defendant\u0027s table with Stettin Palver, looking decidedly uncomfortable. Hari\u0027s cheeks were flushed from the unaccustomed praise (after all, lately his name was the subject of derisive snickers rather than flowery plaudits) and his hand shook slightly on the carved Dandle of his trusty cane. Judge Lih gazed down at Seldon clearly unimpressed. \"What benefit, indeed, Counselor. I have been asking myself that very question. I\u0027ve lain make these past nights, racking my brains for a plausible reason. Why should a man of Professor Seldon\u0027s stature commit unprovoked assault and battery when he himself is one of our most outspoken critics of the so-called \u0027breakdown\u0027 of civil order? \"And then it dawned on me. Perhaps, in his frustration at not being believed, Professor Seldon feels he must prove to the worlds that his predictions of doom and gloom really are coming to pass. After all, here is a man who has spent his entire career foretelling the Fall of the Empire and all he can really point to are a few burned-out bulbs in the dome, an occasional glitch in public transport, a budget cut here or there-nothing very dramatic. But an attack-or two or three-now, that would be something.\" Lih sat back and folded her hands in front of her, a satisfied expression on her face. Seldon stood, leaning heavily on the table for support. With great effort, he approached the bench, waving off his lawyer, walking headlong into the steely gaze of the judge. \"Your Honor, please permit me to say a few words in my defense.\" \"Of course, Professor Seldon. After all, this is not a trial, only a hearing to air all allegations, facts, and theories pertinent to the** case before deciding whether or not to go ahead with a trial. I have merely expressed a theory; I am most interested to hear what you have to say.\" Seldon cleared his throat before beginning. \"I have devoted my life to the Empire. I have faithfully served the Emperors. My science of psychohistory, rather than being a harbinger of destruction, is intended to be used as an agent for rejuvenation. With it we can be prepared for whatever course civilization takes. If, as I believe, the Empire continues to break down, psychohistory will help us put into place building blocks for a new and better civilization founded on all that is good from the old. I love our worlds, our peoples, our Empire-what would it behoove me to contribute to the lawlessness that saps its strength daily? \"I can say no more. You must believe me. I, a man of intellect, of equations, of science-I am speaking from my heart.\" Seldon turned and made his way slowly back to his chair beside Palver. Before sitting, his eyes sought Wanda, sitting in the spectators\u0027 gallery. She smiled wanly and winked at him. \"From the heart or not, Professor Seldon, this decision will require much thought on my part. We have heard from your accusers; we have heard from you and Mr. Palver. There is one more party whose testimony I need. I\u0027d like to hear from Rial Nevas, who has come forward as an eyewitness to this incident.\" As Nevas approached the bench, Seldon and Palver looked at each other in alarm. It was the boy whom Hari had admonished just before the attack. Lih was asking the youth a question. \"Would you describe, Mr. Nevas, exactly what you witnessed on the night in question?\" \"Well,\" started Nevas, fixing Seldon with his sullen stare, \"I was walkin\u0027 along, mindin\u0027 my own business, when I saw those two,\"-he turned and pointed at Seldon and Palver-\"on the other side of the walkway, comin\u0027 toward me. And then I saw those three kids.\" (Another point of the finger, this time toward the three sitting at the plaintiff\u0027s table.) \"The two older guys were walkin\u0027 behind the kids. They didn\u0027t see me, though, on account of I was on the other side of the walkway and besides, they were concentratin\u0027 on their victims. Then wham! Just like that, that old guy swings at \u0027em with his stick, then the younger guy jumps \u0027em and kicks \u0027em and before you know it, they\u0027re all down on the ground. Then the old guy and his pal, they just took off, just like that. I couldn\u0027t believe it.\" \"That\u0027s a lie!\" Seldon exploded. \"Young man, you\u0027re playing with our lives here!\" Nevas only stared back at Seldon impassively. \"Judge,\" Seldon implored, \"can\u0027t you see that he is lying? I remember this fellow. I scolded him for littering just minutes before we were attacked. I pointed it out to Stettin as another instance of the breakdown of our society, the apathy of the citizenry, the-\" \"Enough, Professor Seldon,\" commanded the judge. \"Another outburst like that and I will have you ejected from this courtroom. Now, Mr. Nevas,\" she said, turning back to the witness. \"What did you do throughout the sequence of events you just described?\" \"I, uh, I hid. Behind some trees. I hid. I was afraid they\u0027d come after me if they saw me, so I hid. And when they were gone, well, I ran and called the security officers.\" Nevas had started to sweat and he inserted a finger into the constricting collar of his unisuit. He fidgeted, shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he stood on the raised speaker\u0027s platform. He was uncomfortably aware of the crowd\u0027s eyes upon him; he tried to avoid looking into the audience, but each time he did, he found himself drawn to the **toady gaze of a pretty blond girl sitting in the first row. It was as if she was asking him a question, pressing him for an answer, willing him to **peak. \"Mr. Nevas, what do you have to say about Professor Seldon\u0027s allegation that he and Mr. Palver did see you prior to the attack, that the professor actually exchanged words with you?\" \"Well, uh, no, you see, it was just like I said... I was walkin\u0027 along and-\" And now Nevas looked over at Seldon\u0027s table. Seldon looked at the young man sadly, as if he realized all was lost. But Seldon\u0027s companion, Stettin Palver, turned a fierce gaze on Nevas and Nevas jumped, startled, at the words he heard: Tell the truth! It was as if Palver had spoken, but Palver\u0027s lips hadn\u0027t moved. And then, confused, Nevas snapped his head in the direction of the blond girl; he thought he heard her speak-Tell the truth!-but her lips were still as well. \"Mr. Nevas, Mr. Nevas,\" the judge\u0027s voice broke in on the youth\u0027s jumbled thoughts. \"Mr. Nevas, if Professor Seldon and Mr. Palver were walking toward you, behind the three plaintiffs, how is it that you noticed Seldon and Palver first? That is how you put it in your statement, is it not?\" Nevas glanced around the courtroom wildly. He couldn\u0027t seem to escape the eyes, all the eyes screaming at him to Tell the truth! Looking over at Hari Seldon, Rial Nevas said simply, \"I\u0027m sorry\" and, to the amazement of the entire courtroom assemblage, the fourteen-year-old boy started to cry.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forward-the-foundation-foundation-7/page-27.html","bookId":2019,"book":{"id":2019,"title":"Forward the Foundation (Foundation #7)","description":"Storyline: Forward the Foundation (Foundation: Prequel, #2) A stunning testament to his creative genius.
