{"id":107417,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Part III\\n\\n Dors Venabili\\n\\n VENABILI, DORS-The life of Hari Seldon is well encrusted with legend and uncertainty, so that little hope remains of ever obtaining a biography that can be thoroughly factual. Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of his life deals with his consort, Dors Venabili. There is no information whatever concerning Dors Venabili, except for her birth on the world of Cinna, prior to her arrival at Streeling University to become a member of the history faculty. Shortly after that, she met Seldon and remained his consort for twenty-eight years. If anything, her life is more interlarded with legend than Seldon\u0027s is. There are quite unbelievable tales of her strength and speed and she was widely spoken of, or perhaps whispered of, as \"The Tiger Woman.\" Still more puzzling than her coming, however, is her going, for after a certain time, we hear of her no more and there is no indication as to what happened.\\n\\n Her role as a historian is evidenced by her works on-\\n\\n Encyclopedia Galactica\\n\\n 1\\n\\n Wanda was almost eight years old now, going by Galactic Standard Time -as everyone did. She was quite the little lady-grave in manner, with straight light-brown hair. Her eyes were blue but were darkening and she might well end with the brown eyes of her father.\\n\\n She sat there, lost in thought. Sixty.\\n\\n That was the number that preoccupied her. Grandfather was going to have a birthday and it was going to be his sixtieth-and sixty was a large number. It bothered her because yesterday she had had a bad dream about it.\\n\\n She went in search of her mother. She would have to ask.\\n\\n Her mother was not hard to find. She was talking to Grandfather-about the birthday surely. Wanda hesitated. It wouldn\u0027t be nice to ask in front of Grandfather.\\n\\n Her mother had no trouble whatever sensing Wanda\u0027s consternation. She said, \"One minute, Hari, and let\u0027s see what\u0027s bothering Wanda. What is it, dear?\"\\n\\n Wanda pulled at her hand. \"Not here, Mother. Private.\"\\n\\n Manella turned to Hari Seldon. \"See how early it starts? Private lives. Private problems. Of course, Wanda, shall we go to your room?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Mother.\" Wanda was clearly relieved.\\n\\n Hand in hand, they went and then her mother said, \"Now what is the problem, Wanda?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Grandfather, Mother.\"\\n\\n \"Grandfather! I can\u0027t imagine him doing anything to bother you.\"\\n\\n \"Well, he is.\" Wanda\u0027s eyes filled with sudden tears. \"Is he going to die?\"\\n\\n \"Your grandfather? What put that into your head, Wanda?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s going to be sixty. That\u0027s so old.\"\\n\\n \"No, it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s not young, but it\u0027s not old, either. People live to be eighty, ninety, even a hundred-and your grandfather is strong and healthy. He\u0027ll live a long time.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" She was sniffing.\\n\\n Manella grasped her daughter by the shoulders and looked her straight in the eyes. \"We must all die someday, Wanda. I\u0027ve explained that to you before. Just the same, we don\u0027t worry about it till the someday is much closer.\" She wiped Wanda\u0027s eyes gently. \"Grandfather is going to stay alive till you\u0027re all grown up and have babies of your own. You\u0027ll see. Now come back with me. I want you to talk to Grandfather.\"\\n\\n Wanda sniffed again.\\n\\n Seldon looked at the little girl with a sympathetic expression on her return and said, \"What is it, Wanda? Why are you unhappy?\"\\n\\n Wanda shook her head.\\n\\n Seldon turned his gaze to the girl\u0027s mother. \"Well, what is it, Manella?\"\\n\\n Manella shook her head. \"She\u0027ll have to tell you herself.\"\\n\\n Seldon sat down and tapped his lap. \"Come, Wanda. Have a seat and tell me your troubles.\"\\n\\n She obeyed and wriggled a bit, then said, \"I\u0027m scared.\"\\n\\n Seldon put his arm around her. \"Nothing to be scared of in your old grandfather.\"\\n\\n Manella made a face. \"Wrong word.\"\\n\\n Seldon looked up at her. \"Grandfather?\"\\n\\n \"No. Old.\"\\n\\n That seemed to break the dike. Wanda burst into tears. \"You\u0027re old, Grandfather.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose so. I\u0027m sixty.\" He bent his face down to Wanda\u0027s and whispered, \"I don\u0027t like it, either, Wanda. That\u0027s why I\u0027m glad you\u0027re only seven going on eight.\"\\n\\n \"Your hair is white, Grandpa.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t always. It just turned white recently.\"\\n\\n \"White hair means you\u0027re going to die, Grandpa.\"\\n\\n Seldon looked shocked. He said to Manella, \"What is all this?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, Hari. It\u0027s her own idea.\"\\n\\n \"I had a bad dream,\" said Wanda.\\n\\n Seldon cleared his throat. \"We all have bad dreams now and then, Wanda. It\u0027s good we do. Bad dreams get rid of bad thoughts and then we\u0027re better off.\"\\n\\n \"It was about you dying, Grandfather.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I know. Dreams can be about dying, but that doesn\u0027t make them important. Look at me. Don\u0027t you see how alive I am-and cheerful-and laughing? Do I look as though I\u0027m dying? Tell me.\"\\n\\n \"N-no.\"\\n\\n \"There you are, then. Now you go out and play and forget all about this. I\u0027m just having a birthday and everyone will have a good time. Go ahead, dear.\"\\n\\n Wanda left in reasonable cheer, but Seldon motioned to Manella to stay.\\n\\n 2\\n\\n Seldon said, \"Wherever do you think Wanda got such a notion?\"\\n\\n \"Come now, Hari. She had a Salvanian gecko that died, remember? One of her friends had a father who died in an accident and she sees deaths on holovision all the time. It is impossible for any child to be so protected as not to be aware of death. Actually I wouldn\u0027t want her to be so protected. Death is an essential part of life; she must learn that.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mean death in general, Manella. I mean my death in particular. What has put that into her head?\"\\n\\n Manella hesitated. She was very fond, indeed, of Hari Seldon. She thought, Who would not be, so how can I say this?\\n\\n But how could she not say this? So she said, \"Hari, you yourself put it into her head.\"\\n\\n \"I?\"\\n\\n \"Of course, you\u0027ve been speaking for months of turning sixty and complaining loudly of growing old. The only reason people are setting up this party is to console you.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s no fun turning sixty,\" said Seldon indignantly. \"Wait! Wait! You\u0027ll find out.\"\\n\\n \"I will-if I\u0027m lucky. Some people don\u0027t make it to sixty. Just the same, if turning sixty and being old are all you talk about, you end up frightening an impressionable little girl.\"\\n\\n Seldon sighed and looked troubled. \"I\u0027m sorry, but it\u0027s hard. Look at my hands. They\u0027re getting spotted and soon they\u0027ll be gnarled. I can do hardly anything in the way of Twisting any longer. A child could probably force me to my knees.\"\\n\\n \"In what way does that make you different from other sixty-year-olds? At least your brain is working as well as ever. How often have you said that that\u0027s all that counts?\"\\n\\n \"I know. But I miss my body.\"\\n\\n Manella said with just a touch of malice, \"Especially when Dors doesn\u0027t seem to get any older.\"\\n\\n Seldon said uneasily, \"Well yes, I suppose-\" He looked away, clearly unwilling to talk about the matter.\\n\\n Manella looked at her father-in-law gravely. The trouble was, he knew nothing about children-or about people generally. It was hard to think that he had spent ten years as First Minister under the old Emperor and yet ended up knowing as little about people as he did.\\n\\n Of course, he was entirely wrapped up in this psychohistory of his, that dealt with quadrillions of people, which ultimately meant dealing with no people at all-as individuals. And how could he know about children when he had had no contact with any child except Raych, who had entered his life as a twelve-year-old? Now he had Wanda, who was-and would probably remain to him-an utter mystery.\\n\\n Manella thought all this lovingly. She had the incredible desire to protect Hari Seldon from a world he did not understand. It was the only point at which she and her mother-in-law, Dors Venabili, met and coalesced-this desire to protect Hari Seldon.\\n\\n Manella had saved Seldon\u0027s life ten years before. Dors, in her strange way, had considered this an invasion of her prerogative and had never quite forgiven Manella.\\n\\n Seldon, in his turn, had then saved Manella\u0027s life. She closed her eyes briefly and the whole scene returned to her, almost as though it were happening to her right now.\\n\\n 3\\n\\n It was a week after the assassination of Cleon-and a horrible week it had been. All of Trantor was in chaos.\\n\\n Hari Seldon still kept his office as First Minister, but it was clear he had no power. He called in Manella Dubanqua.\\n\\n \"I want to thank you for saving Raych\u0027s life and my own. I haven\u0027t had a chance to do so yet.\" Then with a sigh, \"I have scarcely had a chance to do anything this past week.\"\\n\\n Manella asked, \"What happened to the mad gardener?\"\\n\\n \"Executed! At once! No trial! I tried to save him by pointing out that he was insane. But there was no question about it. If he had done anything else, committed any other crime, his madness would have been recognized and he would have been spared. Committed-locked up and treated-but spared, nonetheless. But to kill the Emperor-\" Seldon shook his head sadly.\\n\\n Manella said, \"What\u0027s going to happen now, First Minister?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what I think. The Entun Dynasty is finished. Cleon\u0027s son will not succeed. I don\u0027t think he wants to. He fears assassination in his turn and I don\u0027t blame him one bit. It would be much better for him to retire to one of the family estates on some Outer World and live a quiet life. Because he is a member of the Imperial House, he will untie** allowed to do this. You and I may be less fortunate.\"\\n\\n Manella frowned. \"In what way, sir?\"\\n\\n Seldon cleared his throat. \"It is possible to argue that because you killed Gleb Andorin, he dropped his blaster, which became available to Mandell Gruber, who used it to kill Cleon. Therefore you bear a strong share of the responsibility of the crime and it may even be said that it was all prearranged.\"\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s ridiculous. I am a member of the security establishment, fulfilling my duties-doing what I was ordered to do.\"\\n\\n Seldon smiled sadly. \"You\u0027re arguing rationally and rationality is not going to be in fashion for a while. What\u0027s going to happen now, in the absence of a legitimate successor to the Imperial throne, is that we are bound to have a military government.\"\\n\\n (In later years, when Manella came to understand the workings of psychohistory, she wondered if Seldon had used the technique to work out what was going to happen, for the military rule certainly came to pass. At the time, however, he made no mention of his fledgling theory.)\\n\\n \"If we do have a military government,\" he went on, \"then it will be necessary for them to establish a firm rule at once, crush any signs of disaffection, act vigorously and cruelly, even in defiance of rationality and justice. If they accuse you, Miss Dubanqua, of being part of a plot to kill the Emperor, you will be slaughtered, not as an act of justice but as a way of cowing the people of Trantor.\\n\\n \"For that matter, they might say that I was part of the plot, too. After all, I went out to greet the new gardeners when it was not my place to do so. Had I not done so, there would have been no attempt to kill me, you would not have struck back, and the Emperor would have lived. Do you see how it all fits?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe they will do this.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps they won\u0027t. I\u0027ll make them an offer that, just perhaps, they may not wish to refuse.\"\\n\\n \"What would that be?\"\\n\\n \"I will offer to resign as First Minister. They don\u0027t want me, they won\u0027t have me. But the fact is that I do have supporters at the Imperial Court and, even more important, people in the Outer Worlds who find me acceptable. That means that if the members of the Imperial Guard force me out, then even if they don\u0027t execute me, they will have some trouble. If, on the other hand, I resign, stating that I believe the military government is what Trantor and the Empire needs, then I actually help them, you see?\"\\n\\n He mused a little and said, \"Besides, there is the little matter of psychohistory.\"\\n\\n (That was the first time Manella had ever heard the word.)\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Something I\u0027m working on. Cleon believed in its powers very strongly-more strongly than I did at the time-and there\u0027s a considerable feeling in the court that psychohistory is, or might be, a powerful tool that could be made to work on the side of the government-whatever the government might be.\\n\\n \"Nor does it matter if they know nothing about the details of the science. I\u0027d rather they didn\u0027t. Lack of knowledge can increase what we might call the superstitious aspect of the situation. In which case, they will let me continue working on my research as a private citizen. At least, I hope so. And that brings me to you.\"\\n\\n \"What about me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to ask as part of the deal that you be allowed to resign from** the security establishment and that no action be taken against you for** the events in connection with the assassination. I ought to be able to\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re talking about ending my career.\"\\n\\n \"Your career is, in any case, over. Even if the Imperial Guard doesn\u0027t up an order of execution against you, can you imagine that you will Be allowed to continue working as a security officer?\"\\n\\n \"But what do I do? How do I make a living?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take care of that, Miss Dubanqua. In all likelihood, I\u0027ll go back to Streeling University, with a large grant for my psychohistorical research, I\u0027m sure that I can find a place for you.\"\\n\\n Manella, round-eyed, said, \"Why should you-\"\\n\\n Seldon said, \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re asking. You saved Raych\u0027s life and own. Is it conceivable that I don\u0027t owe you anything?\"\\n\\n And it was as he said. Seldon resigned gracefully from the post he had held for ten years. He was given a fulsome letter of appreciation for his services by the just-formed military government, a junta led by certain members of the Imperial Guard and the armed forces. He returned to Streeling University and Manella Dubanqua, relieved of her own post as security officer, went with Seldon and his family.\\n\\n 4\\n\\n Raych came in, blowing on his hands. \"I\u0027m all for deliberate variety in the weather. You don\u0027t want things under a dome to always be the same. Today though, they made it just a little too cold and worked up a wind, besides. I think it\u0027s about time someone complained to weather control.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s weather control\u0027s fault,\" said Seldon. \"It\u0027s getting harder to control things in general.\"\\n\\n \"I know. Deterioration.\" Raych brushed his thick black mustache with the back of his hand. He did that often, as though he had never quite managed to get over the few months during which he had been mustacheless in Wye. He had also put on a little weight around the middle and, overall, had come to seem very comfortable and middleclass. Even his Dahl accent had faded somewhat.\\n\\n He took off his light coverall and said, \"And how\u0027s the old birthday boy?\"\\n\\n \"Resenting it. Wait, wait, my son. One of these days, you\u0027ll be celebrating your fortieth birthday. We\u0027ll see how funny you\u0027ll think that is.\"\\n\\n \"Not as funny as sixty.\"\\n\\n \"Stop joking,\" said Manella, who had been chafing Raych\u0027s hands, trying to warm them.\\n\\n Seldon spread his own hands. \"We\u0027re doing the wrong thing, Raych. Your wife is of the opinion that all this talk about my turning sixty has sent little Wanda into a decline over the possibility of my dying.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" said Raych. \"That accounts for it, then. I stopped in to see her and she told me at once, before I even had a chance to say a word, that she had had a bad dream. Was it about your dying?\"\\n\\n \"Apparently,\" said Seldon.\\n\\n \"Well, she\u0027ll get over that. No way of stopping bad dreams.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not dismissing it that easily,\" said Manella. \"She\u0027s brooding over it and that\u0027s not healthy. I\u0027m going to get to the bottom of this.\"\\n\\n \"As you say, Manella,\" said Raych agreeably. \"You\u0027re my dear wife and whatever you say-about Wanda-goes.\" And he brushed his mustache again.\\n\\n His dear wife! It hadn\u0027t been so easy to make her his dear wife. Raych remembered his mother\u0027s attitude toward the possibility. Talk about nightmares. It was he who had the periodic nightmares in which he had to face down the furious Dors Venabili once more.\\n\\n 5\\n\\n Raych\u0027s first clear memory, after emerging from his desperance-induced ordeal, was that of being shaved.\\n\\n He felt the vibrorazor moving along his cheek and he said weakly, \"Don\u0027t cut anywhere near my upper lip, barber. I want my mustache back.\"\\n\\n The barber, who had already received his instructions from Seldon held up a mirror to reassure him.\\n\\n Dors Venabili, who was sitting at his bedside, said, \"Let him work, Raych. Don\u0027t excite yourself.\"\\n\\n Raych\u0027s eyes turned toward her momentarily and he was quiet. When the barber left, Dors said, \"How do you feel, Raych?\"\\n\\n \"Rotten,\" he muttered. \"I\u0027m so depressed, I can\u0027t stand it.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the lingering effect of the desperance you\u0027ve been dosed with. The effects will wash out.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe it. How long has it been?\"\\n\\n \"Never mind. It will take time. You were pumped full of it.\"\\n\\n He looked around restlessly. \"Has Manella been to see me?\"\\n\\n \"That woman?\" (Raych was getting used to hearing Dors speak of Manella with those words and in that tone of voice.) \"No. You\u0027re not fit for visitors yet.\"\\n\\n Interpreting the look on Raych\u0027s face, Dors quickly added, \"I\u0027m an exception because I\u0027m your mother, Raych. Why would you want that woman to see you, anyway? You\u0027re in no condition to be seen.\"\\n\\n \"All the more reason to see her,\" muttered Raych. \"I want her to see me at my worst.\" He then turned to one side dispiritedly. \"I want to sleep.\"\\n\\n Dors Venabili shook her head. Later that day she said to Seldon \"I don\u0027t know what we\u0027re going to do about Raych. Hari. He\u0027s quite unreasonable.\"\\n\\n Seldon said, \"He\u0027s not well, Dors. Give the young man a chance.\"\\n\\n \"He keeps muttering about that woman. Whatever her name is.\"\\n\\n \"Manella Dubanqua. It\u0027s not a hard name to remember.\"\\n\\n \"I think he wants to set up housekeeping with her. Live with her. Marry her.\"\\n\\n Seldon shrugged. \"Raych is thirty-old enough to make up his own mind.\"\\n\\n \"As his parents, we have something to say-surely.\"\\n\\n Hari sighed. \"And I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve said it, Dors. And once you\u0027ve said it, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll do as he wishes.\"\\n\\n \"Is that your final word? Do you intend to do nothing while he makes plans to marry a woman like that?\"\\n\\n \"What do you expect me to do, Dors? Manella saved Raych\u0027s life. Do you expect him to forget that? She saved mine, too, for that matter.\"\\n\\n That seemed to feed Dors\u0027s anger. She said, \"And you also saved her. The score is even.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t exactly-\"\\n\\n \"Of course you did. The military rascals who now run the Empire would have slaughtered her if you didn\u0027t step in and sell them your resignation and your support in order to save her.\"\\n\\n \"Though I may have evened the score, which I don\u0027t think I have, Raych has not. And, Dors dear, I would be very careful when it came to using unfortunate terms to describe our government. These times are not going to be as easy as the times when Cleon ruled and there will always be informers to repeat what they hear you say.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind that. I don\u0027t like that woman. I presume that, at least, is permissible.\"\\n\\n \"Permissible, certainly, but of no use.\"\\n\\n Hari looked down at the floor, deep in thought. Dors\u0027s usually unfathomable black eyes were positively flashing in anger. Hari looked up.\\n\\n \"What I\u0027d like to know, Dors, is why? Why do you dislike Manella so? She saved our lives. If it had not been for her quick action, both Raych and I would be dead.\"\\n\\n Dors snapped back, \"Yes, Hari. I know that better than anyone. And if she had not been there, I would not have been able to do a thing to prevent your murder. I suppose you think I should be grateful. But every time I look at that woman, I am reminded of my failure. I know these feelings are not truly rational-and that is something I can\u0027t explain. So do not ask me to like her, Hari. I cannot.\"\\n\\n But the next day even Dors had to back down when the doctor said, \"Your son wishes to see a woman named Manella.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in no condition to see visitors,\" snapped Dors.\\n\\n \"On the contrary. He is. He\u0027s doing quite well. Besides, he insists and is doing so most strenuously. I don\u0027t know that we\u0027d be wise to refuse him.\"\\n\\n So they brought in Manella and Raych greeted her effusively and with the first faint sign of happiness since he had arrived at the hospital.\\n\\n He made an unmistakable small gesture of dismissal at Dors. Lips tightened, she left.\\n\\n And the day came when Raych said, \"She\u0027ll have me, Mom.\"\\n\\n Dors said, \"Do you expect me to be surprised, you foolish man? Of course she\u0027ll have you. You\u0027re her only chance, now that she\u0027s been disgraced, ousted from the security establishment...\"\\n\\n Raych said, \"Mom, if you\u0027re trying to lose me, this is exactly the way of doing it. Don\u0027t say things like that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m only thinking of your welfare.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll think of my own good, thank you. I\u0027m no one\u0027s ticket to respectability-if you\u0027ll stop to think of it. I\u0027m not exactly handsome. I\u0027m short. Dad isn\u0027t First Minister anymore and I talk solid lower-class. What\u0027s there for her to be proud of in me? She can do a lot better, but she wants me. And let me tell you, I want her.\"\\n\\n \"But you know what she is.\"\\n\\n \"Of course I know what she is. She\u0027s a woman who loves me. She\u0027s the woman I love. That\u0027s what she is.\"\\n\\n \"And before you fell in love with her, what was she? You know some of what she had to do while undercover in Wye you were one of her \u0027assignments.\u0027 How many others were there? Are you able to live with her past? With what she did in the name of duty? Now you can afford to be idealistic. But someday you will have your first quarrel with her-or your second or your nineteenth-and you\u0027ll break down and say, \u0027You-**\"\\n\\n Raych shouted angrily, \"Don\u0027t say that! When we fight, I\u0027ll call her unreasonable, irrational, nagging, whining, inconsiderate-a million adjectives that will fit the situation. And she\u0027ll have words for me. But they\u0027ll all be sensible words that can be withdrawn when the fight is over.\"\\n\\n \"You think so-but just wait till it happens.\"\\n\\n Raych had turned white. He said, \"Mother, you\u0027ve been with Father now for almost twenty years. Father is a hard man to disagree with, but there have been times when you two have argued. I\u0027ve heard you. In all those twenty years, has he ever called you by any name that would in any way compromise your role as human being? For that matter, have I done so? Can you conceive of me doing so now-no matter how angry I get?\"\\n\\n Dors struggled. Her face did not show emotion in quite the same way that Raych\u0027s did or Seldon\u0027s would, but it was clear that she was momentarily incapable of speech.\\n\\n \"In fact,\" said Raych, pushing his advantage (and feeling horrible at doing so) \"the fact of the matter is that you are jealous because Manella saved Dad\u0027s life. You don\u0027t want anyone to do that but you. Well, you had no chance to do so. Would you prefer it if Manella had not shot Andorin-if Dad had died? And me, too?\"\\n\\n Dors said in a choked voice, \"He insisted on going out to meet the gardeners alone. He would not allow me to come.\"\\n\\n \"But that wasn\u0027t Manella\u0027s fault.\"\\n\\n \"Is that why you want to marry her? Gratitude?\"\\n\\n \"No. Love.\"\\n\\n And so it was, but Manella said to Raych after the ceremony, \"Your mother may have attended the wedding because you insisted, Raych, but she looked like one of those thunderclouds they sometimes send sailing under the dome.\"\\n\\n Raych laughed. \"She doesn\u0027t have the face to be a thundercloud. You\u0027re just imagining it.\"\\n\\n \"Not at all. How will we ever get her to give us a chance?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll just be patient. She\u0027ll get over it.\"\\n\\n But Dors Venabili didn\u0027t.\\n\\n Two years after the wedding, Wanda was born. Dors\u0027s attitude toward the child was all Raych and Manella could have wanted, but Wanda\u0027s mother remained \"that woman\" to Raych\u0027s mother. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forward-the-foundation-foundation-7/page-15.html","bookId":2019,"book":{"id":2019,"title":"Forward the Foundation (Foundation #7)","description":"Storyline: Forward the Foundation (Foundation: Prequel, #2) \\n A stunning testament to his creative genius.
