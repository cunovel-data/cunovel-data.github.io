{"id":42240,"no":100,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 46","content":"We left Don Quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of the enamourned maid Altisidora had given rise to. He went to bed with them, and just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get a moment’s rest, and the broken stitches of his stockings helped them. But as Time is fleet and no obstacle can stay his course, he came riding on the hours, and morning very soon arrived. Seeing which Don Quixote quitted the soft down, and, nowise slothful, dressed himself in his chamois suit and put on his travelling boots to hide the disaster to his stockings. He threw over him his scarlet mantle, put on his head a montera of green velvet trimmed with silver edging, flung across his shoulder the baldric with his good trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried with him, and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting for him. But as he passed through a gallery, Altisidora and the other damsel, her friend, were lying in wait for him, and the instant Altisidora saw him she pretended to faint, while her friend caught her in her lap, and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her dress. Don Quixote observed it, and approaching them said, “I know very well what this seizure arises from.” “I know not from what,” replied the friend, “for Altisidora is the healthiest damsel in all this house, and I have never heard her complain all the time I have known her. A plague on all the knights-errant in the world, if they be all ungrateful! Go away, Senor Don Quixote; for this poor child will not come to herself again so long as you are here.” To which Don Quixote returned, “Do me the favour, senora, to let a lute be placed in my chamber to-night; and I will comfort this poor maiden to the best of my power; for in the early stages of love a prompt disillusion is an approved remedy;” and with this he retired, so as not to be remarked by any who might see him there. He had scarcely withdrawn when Altisidora, recovering from her swoon, said to her companion, “The lute must be left, for no doubt Don Quixote intends to give us some music; and being his it will not be bad.” They went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on, and of the lute Don Quixote asked for, and she, delighted beyond measure, plotted with the duke and her two damsels to play him a trick that should be amusing but harmless; and in high glee they waited for night, which came quickly as the day had come; and as for the day, the duke and duchess spent it in charming conversation with Don Quixote. When eleven o’clock came, Don Quixote found a guitar in his chamber; he tried it, opened the window, and perceived that some persons were walking in the garden; and having passed his fingers over the frets of the guitar and tuned it as well as he could, he spat and cleared his chest, and then with a voice a little hoarse but full-toned, he sang the following ballad, which he had himself that day composed: Mighty Love the hearts of maidens Doth unsettle and perplex, And the instrument he uses Most of all is idleness. Sewing, stitching, any labour, Having always work to do, To the poison Love instilleth Is the antidote most sure. And to proper-minded maidens Who desire the matron’s name Modesty’s a marriage portion, Modesty their highest praise. Men of prudence and discretion, Courtiers gay and gallant knights, With the wanton damsels dally, But the modest take to wife. There are passions, transient, fleeting, Loves in hostelries declar’d, Sunrise loves, with sunset ended, When the guest hath gone his way. Love that springs up swift and sudden, Here to-day, to-morrow flown, Passes, leaves no trace behind it, Leaves no image on the soul. Painting that is laid on painting Maketh no display or show; Where one beauty’s in possession There no other can take hold. Dulcinea del Toboso Painted on my heart I wear; Never from its tablets, never, Can her image be eras’d. The quality of all in lovers Most esteemed is constancy; ‘T is by this that love works wonders, This exalts them to the skies. Don Quixote had got so far with his song, to which the duke, the duchess, Altisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle were listening, when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly over his window they let down a cord with more than a hundred bells attached to it, and immediately after that discharged a great sack full of cats, which also had bells of smaller size tied to their tails. Such was the din of the bells and the squalling of the cats, that though the duke and duchess were the contrivers of the joke they were startled by it, while Don Quixote stood paralysed with fear; and as luck would have it, two or three of the cats made their way in through the grating of his chamber, and flying from one side to the other, made it seem as if there was a legion of devils at large in it. They extinguished the candles that were burning in the room, and rushed about seeking some way of escape; the cord with the large bells never ceased rising and falling; and most of the people of the castle, not knowing what was really the matter, were at their wits’ end with astonishment. Don Quixote sprang to his feet, and drawing his sword, began making passes at the grating, shouting out, “Avaunt, malignant enchanters! avaunt, ye witchcraft-working rabble! I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, against whom your evil machinations avail not nor have any power.” And turning upon the cats that were running about the room, he made several cuts at them. They dashed at the grating and escaped by it, save one that, finding itself hard pressed by the slashes of Don Quixote’s sword, flew at his face and held on to his nose tooth and nail, with the pain of which he began to shout his loudest. The duke and duchess hearing this, and guessing what it was, ran with all haste to his room, and as the poor gentleman was striving with all his might to detach the cat from his face, they opened the door with a master-key and went in with lights and witnessed the unequal combat. The duke ran forward to part the combatants, but Don Quixote cried out aloud, “Let no one take him from me; leave me hand to hand with this demon, this wizard, this enchanter; I will teach him, I myself, who Don Quixote of La Mancha is.” The cat, however, never minding these threats, snarled and held on; but at last the duke pulled it off and flung it out of the window. Don Quixote was left with a face as full of holes as a sieve and a nose not in very good condition, and greatly vexed that they did not let him finish the battle he had been so stoutly fighting with that villain of an enchanter. They sent for some oil of John’s wort, and Altisidora herself with her own fair hands bandaged all the wounded parts; and as she did so she said to him in a low voice. “All these mishaps have befallen thee, hardhearted knight, for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and God grant thy squire Sancho may forget to whip himself, so that that dearly beloved Dulcinea of thine may never be released from her enchantment, that thou mayest never come to her bed, at least while I who adore thee am alive.” To all this Don Quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs, and then stretched himself on his bed, thanking the duke and duchess for their kindness, not because he stood in any fear of that bell-ringing rabble of enchanters in cat shape, but because he recognised their good intentions in coming to his rescue. The duke and duchess left him to repose and withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the joke; as they never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on Don Quixote or cost him so dear, for it cost him five days of confinement to his bed, during which he had another adventure, pleasanter than the late one, which his chronicler will not relate just now in order that he may turn his attention to Sancho Panza, who was proceeding with great diligence and drollery in his government. 情意绵绵，却受到铃铛和猫的惊吓 前面说到，伟大的唐吉诃德被阿尔蒂西多拉姑娘的歌声搅得心绪不宁。他虽然躺到了床上，却仿佛有跳蚤在身上无法入睡，一刻也不能安宁。可是时间在悄悄流逝，没有任何东西阻挡得住。时间从唐吉诃德身边溜过，很快就到了第二天早晨。唐吉诃德看见天亮了，便撇开柔软的羽被，并没有一丝困意。他穿上他的麂皮衣，又穿上旅行靴，以此遮掩那倒霉的袜子，又往身上被了件红色披风，往头上戴了一顶银带镶边的绿色天鹅绒帽子。他把那柄锋利的剑挂到皮肩带上，拿起一大串他时刻不离手的念珠，装模作样地一摇一晃向前厅走去。公爵和公爵夫人已穿戴整齐，正在前厅等着他。唐吉诃德经过一个长廊时发现阿尔蒂西多拉和她的朋友，也就是那另外一位姑娘，正特意在长廊上等着他呢。阿尔蒂西多拉一看到唐吉诃德就假装晕了过去。她的朋友立刻把她抱在自己腿上，并且马上要为她解开胸衣。 唐吉诃德见状立刻走过来说道： “我知道这是怎么回事。” “可我不知道。”阿尔蒂西多拉的朋友说，“阿尔蒂西多拉是我们这儿身体最好的姑娘。自从我认识她以后，从没听她哼过一声。如果世界上的游侠骑士都是无情无义的东西，那就让他们都不得好死吧。请您走开，唐吉诃德大人，如果您在这儿，这个姑娘就不会醒来。” 唐吉诃德说道： “姑娘，请你今晚在我的房间里放一把琴，我将尽力安抚这位心受创伤的姑娘。在爱情萌芽之际就及时让当事人醒悟，通常是最有效的补救办法。” 唐吉诃德说完就走了，他不愿意让别人看见他在那儿。 唐吉诃德刚刚走开，阿尔蒂西多拉就苏醒过来，对她的伙伴说道： “得往唐吉诃德的房间里放一把琴。他肯定会给咱们唱歌，而且唱得很不错。” 她们把刚才的事和唐吉诃德要琴的事告诉了公爵夫人，公爵夫人非常高兴。她同公爵和姑娘们商量好，要同唐吉诃德开一个风趣而无恶意的玩笑。大家高高兴兴地等着天黑。那天，公爵和公爵夫人同唐吉诃德美美地聊了一天，白天像黑夜一样很快就过去了。公爵夫人还真的派了她的一名侍童去找特雷莎·潘萨，派的就是那个曾在森林里扮成被魔法改变了模样的杜尔西内亚的侍童。公爵夫人让侍童送去桑乔写给特雷莎·潘萨的那封信和桑乔要捎回家的一捆衣服，并且在回来以后把他在那儿遇到的事情详细讲述一遍。一切准备就绪，此时已是半夜十一点，唐吉诃德发现他的房间里有一把琴。他调了调琴弦，打开窗户，觉得花园里有人在走动，便试了一下琴弦，仔细调好音，用力清了清嗓子。虽然他是个哑嗓子，可还是自鸣得意地唱起了他当天编的这首歌： 爱情的力量 常令人春心荡漾， 造成它的就是 人的悠闲游逛。 缝缝补补，操劳耕作， 终日奔忙， 就是医治爱情饥渴的 最好处方。 深闺佳秀 追求的是在结婚之日， 贞操和人们的赞扬 能成为她的嫁妆。 游侠骑士 和宫廷朝臣， 总是同浪女调情， 同正派的姑娘拜堂。 也有些萍水相逢， 野路鸳鸯， 他们逢场作戏， 分手便忘。 突然降临的爱情 今日到来明日忘， 不会在人心中 留下坚实的印象。 画上再作画， 徒劳一场。 有了第一个心上人， 便容不得旁人争抢。 托博索的杜尔西内亚 已经印在我心灵的空白画板上， 留下了不可磨灭的 肖像一张。 爱情的忠贞 最为宝贵， 爱情由此升华， 爱情由此高尚。 唐吉诃德的歌谣就唱到这里。公爵、公爵夫人、阿尔蒂西多拉和城堡里几乎所有的人都在那儿听他唱。忽然，从唐吉诃德房间窗户正上方的阳台上垂下一条系着一百多个铃铛的绳子，接着又有人从上面放下一大口袋猫，猫的尾巴上都系着小铃铛。 铃铛和猫叫的声音都很大，使得这场玩笑的组织者公爵和公爵夫人也吓了一跳。唐吉诃德更是吓得魂飞魄散。偏巧，有两三只猫从窗户掉进了唐吉诃德的房间里。它们在房间里东奔西窜，简直像闹鬼似的。猫把房间里的两支蜡烛扑灭了，然后到处乱跑，寻找逃走的出口。绳子一上一下铃声不止，城堡里的人大多数都不知实情，感到非常惊讶。唐吉诃德站起身，把剑伸到窗外，一边挥砍一边喊道： “滚出去，恶毒的魔法师！滚出去，会巫术的混蛋！我是曼查的唐吉诃德，任何罪恶的企图都对我无能为力！” 唐吉诃德又转身对在他的房间内乱窜的那些猫乱刺一通。几只猫都跑到窗户那儿逃了出去，只有一只猫被唐吉诃德追得太急了，竟跳到了唐吉诃德的脸上，用爪子抓住唐吉诃德的鼻子乱咬，疼得唐吉诃德拼命大喊。公爵和公爵夫人听到了喊声，急忙跑到唐吉诃德的房间门前，用万能钥匙打开了房门，看见这位可怜的骑士正用尽全力把猫从自己的脸上往下拽。他们手持蜡烛走进来，看到了这场不同寻常的搏斗。公爵要上去帮助他把猫拽下来，唐吉诃德却大声说道： “谁也不要把它弄开！让我同这个魔鬼、这个巫师、这个魔法师徒手格斗吧！我要让它知道曼查的唐吉诃德到底是什么人！” 可是，猫却不为这些威胁所动，依然嘶叫着紧抓不放。最后，还是公爵把猫拽了下来，扔出了窗户。 唐吉诃德满脸是伤，鼻子也被抓出了一道道印痕。可是，唐吉诃德仍然为未能把这场同恶毒魔法师的激战进行到底而垂头丧气。有人为唐吉诃德拿来了阿帕里西奥油①，阿尔蒂西多拉用她极其白皙的双手为唐吉诃德的伤口包上了纱布。她一边包伤口，一边低声对唐吉诃德说： “无情的骑士，你遇到了这些晦气的事情皆因你冷若冰霜。但愿上帝让你的侍从桑乔忘了鞭笞自己的事情，让你心爱的杜尔西内亚永远摆脱不了魔法，让你永远不能与她共入洞房，至少在我活着的时候是这样，因为我喜欢你。” ①一种治伤的药，是以其研制者的名字命名的。 唐吉诃德听了一言不发，只是深深地叹了一口气，然后躺到了床上。他对公爵和公爵夫人表示感谢，说自己并不怕魔法师、混蛋猫和铃铛，但他知道他们是好心来救自己。公爵和公爵夫人让唐吉诃德好好休息，然后就离开了。他们为这场玩笑竟让唐吉诃德付出了如此沉痛的代价而深感内疚。唐吉诃德闭门在床上躺了五天，在此期间他又遇到了更为可笑的事情。不过，小说的作者现在暂时还不想叙述，且让我们先去看看正在热心而又滑稽地当总督的桑乔·潘萨吧。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4667.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
