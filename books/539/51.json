{"id":42191,"no":51,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 50","content":"“A good joke, that!” returned Don Quixote. “Books that have been printed with the king’s licence, and with the approbation of those to whom they have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and extolled by great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and simple, in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank or condition they may be — that these should be lies! And above all when they carry such an appearance of truth with them; for they tell us the father, mother, country, kindred, age, place, and the achievements, step by step, and day by day, performed by such a knight or knights! Hush, sir; utter not such blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to act as a sensible man should; only read them, and you will see the pleasure you will derive from them. For, come, tell me, can there be anything more delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes and serpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts swimming about in it, while from the middle of the lake there comes a plaintive voice saying: ‘Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest this dread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath these dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the seven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;’ and then the knight, almost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider, without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing himself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive armour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into the midst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows what his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with which the Elysian fields are not to be compared.\\n\\n \\n\\n The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a strange brilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy trees presents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure, while the ear is soothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless birds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing branches. Here he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid crystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like sifted gold and purest pearls. There he perceives a cunningly wrought fountain of many-coloured jasper and polished marble; here another of rustic fashion where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow mansions of the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled with fragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of varied aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it.\\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous palace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of jacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the materials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is still more rare. And after having seen all this, what can be more charming than to see how a bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate of the castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to set myself now to depict it as the histories describe it to us, I should never have done; and then how she who seems to be the first among them all takes the bold knight who plunged into the boiling lake by the hand, and without addressing a word to him leads him into the rich palace or castle, and strips him as naked as when his mother bore him, and bathes him in lukewarm water, and anoints him all over with sweet-smelling unguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal, all scented and perfumed, while another damsel comes and throws over his shoulders a mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, and even more? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all this, they lead him to another chamber where he finds the tables set out in such style that he is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how they pour out water for his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented flowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the damsels wait on him all in profound silence; how they bring him such a variety of dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss which to select; to hear the music that resounds while he is at table, by whom or whence produced he knows not. And then when the repast is over and the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair, picking his teeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of the others, to enter unexpectedly by the chamber door, and herself by his side, and begin to tell him what the castle is, and how she is held enchanted there, and other things that amaze the knight and astonish the readers who are perusing his history.\\n\\n \\n\\n But I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered from it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant one reads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder; and take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and you will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise your spirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say that since I have been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous, well-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though it be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my faith, senor, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree; and gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as faith without works is dead. For this reason I should be glad were fortune soon to offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor, so as to show my heart in doing good to my friends, particularly to this poor Sancho Panza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world; and I would gladly give him a county I have promised him this ever so long, only that I am afraid he has not the capacity to govern his realm.”\\n\\n Sancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him, “Strive hard you, Senor Don Quixote, to give me that county so often promised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you there will be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, I have heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, paying so much a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government, while the lord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they pay him, without troubling himself about anything else. That’s what I’ll do, and not stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once of the whole business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things go their own way.”\\n\\n “That, brother Sancho,” said the canon, “only holds good as far as the enjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must attend to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound judgment come in, and above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for if this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end will always go wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as he frustrates the evil designs of the crafty.”\\n\\n “I don’t understand those philosophies,” returned Sancho Panza; “all I know is I would I had the county as soon as I shall know how to govern it; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and I shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so I should do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, and pleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has nothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there is an end of it; so let the county come, and God he with you, and let us see one another, as one blind man said to the other.”\\n\\n “That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,” said the canon; “but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of counties.”\\n\\n To which Don Quixote returned, “I know not what more there is to be said; I only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis of Gaul, when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so, without any scruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza, for he is one of the best squires that ever knight-errant had.”\\n\\n The canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be capable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he had described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression that the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly he marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtain the county his master had promised him.\\n\\n By this time the canon’s servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch the sumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass of the meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of some trees and made their repast there, that the carter might not be deprived of the advantage of the spot, as has been already said. As they were eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a bell that seemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes that were close by, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat, spotted all over black, white, and brown, spring out of the thicket with a goatherd after it, calling to it and uttering the usual cries to make it stop or turn back to the fold. The fugitive goat, scared and frightened, ran towards the company as if seeking their protection and then stood still, and the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and began to talk to it as if it were possessed of reason and understanding: “Ah wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have you gone limping all this time? What wolves have frightened you, my daughter? Won’t you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But what else can it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? A plague on your humours and the humours of those you take after! Come back, come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any rate you will be safe in the fold or with your companions; for if you who ought to keep and lead them, go wandering astray, what will become of them?”\\n\\n The goatherd’s talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon, who said to him, “As you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in such a hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female, as you say, she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all you can do to prevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will soothe your irritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest herself,” and so saying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a fork.\\n\\n The goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and then said, “I should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a simpleton for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but the truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used. I am a clown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.”\\n\\n “That I can well believe,” said the curate, “for I know already by experience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds’ harbour philosophers.”\\n\\n “At all events, senor,” returned the goatherd, “they shelter men of experience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, though I may seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if it will not tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a little, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman’s word (and he pointed to the curate) as well as my own.”\\n\\n To this Don Quixote replied, “Seeing that this affair has a certain colour of chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you most gladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence they possess and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm, and entertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do. So begin, friend, for we are all prepared to listen.”\\n\\n “I draw my stakes,” said Sancho, “and will retreat with this pasty to the brook there, where I mean to victual myself for three days; for I have heard my lord, Don Quixote, say that a knight-errant’s squire should eat until he can hold no more, whenever he has the chance, because it often happens them to get by accident into a wood so thick that they cannot find a way out of it for six days; and if the man is not well filled or his alforjas well stored, there he may stay, as very often he does, turned into a dried mummy.”\\n\\n “Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “go where thou wilt and eat all thou canst, for I have had enough, and only want to give my mind its refreshment, as I shall by listening to this good fellow’s story.”\\n\\n “It is what we shall all do,” said the canon; and then begged the goatherd to begin the promised tale.\\n\\n The goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps on the back, saying, “Lie down here beside me, Spotty, for we have time enough to return to our fold.” The goat seemed to understand him, for as her master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside him and looked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what he was going to say, and then in these words he began his story.\\n\\n \\n\\n “真新鲜！”唐吉诃德说，“这些小说是经过国王允许、有关人员批准才出版的。无论大人还是小孩，穷人还是富翁，学者还是老粗，平民还是骑士，一句话，无论什么情况的人都喜欢读，都很欣赏它们。它们的真实性显而易见，把某个或某些骑士的父母、祖籍、亲属、年龄、所在地和事迹都详详细细、逐天逐日地告诉我们，难道是胡说八道吗？\\n\\n “请您住嘴，不要再亵渎神明了。您还是听从我的劝告，做得明智些，去读读这些小说吧，那么您就会发现其乐无穷。不信您听我说，假设我们面前有个沸腾的淡水湖，湖里有很多怪蛇、蜥蜴和其它许多可怕的动物穿梭游弋。这时湖中心传出一个极其凄切的声音，说道：‘你，骑士，或者不管你是什么人，你如果想得到你面前这个可怕的湖泊黑水下面的宝贝，就要拿出你的勇气，跳进这滚滚的沸水里去。你如果不跳进去，就不配看到这下面七仙女城堡的良辰美景。’骑士听完这可怕的声音，丝毫不考虑对自己会有什么危险，甚至来不及脱掉身上沉重的甲胄，只请求上帝和自己的意中人保佑自己，便纵身跳进了沸腾的湖泊。他还没明白自己究竟到了什么地方，就已经来到了一个花团锦簇的原野上。它如此美丽，连厄吕西翁①都无法与之比拟。\\n\\n ①厄吕西翁是希腊神话中信徒和阴魂居住的乐土。\\n\\n “他觉得那里的天空格外晴朗，太阳的光芒格外明亮，眼前一片绿草如茵，树木苍郁，青翠欲滴，秀色可餐。无数只各种花色的小鸟在枝叶丛中穿梭，啼声婉啭。一条清凉的小溪流淌在细沙和白卵石上，仿佛液体水晶流淌在金粉纯珠上。那边有一座用斑纹大理石和单色大理石精雕细琢的喷泉，这边另有一座喷泉却显得纯朴自然，精细的贝壳和白色、黄色的蜗牛壳错落有致地镶嵌在上面，与斑斑点点的发光晶体和祖母绿交织在一起，形成了一幅五彩缤纷的作品，真可谓巧夺天工。\\n\\n “再往前，只见一座坚实的城堡或引人注目的要塞，黄金的围墙，钻石的城堞，紫晶石的门，总之，它的建筑材料里不乏钻石、红宝石、珍珠、金子和祖母绿，令人叹为观止。此时，从城门里出来一大群少女，衣着鲜艳华丽，如果我现在按照书上记述的那样给你们讲一遍，那且讲不完呢。其中一个大概是管事的少女，拉起了那位勇敢跳进沸腾湖水的英武骑士的手，不声不响地把他带进那座辉煌的要塞或城堡，把他的衣服脱得一干二净，用温水为他洗澡，然后又往他全身涂香脂，给他穿上一件香气扑鼻的极薄的纱衣。另外又过来一位少女，在他肩上披了一条大披巾，那披巾据说价值连城，甚至还不止如此呢。后来又怎么样？少女们又把他带进一个客厅，里面已经摆上宴席，其精美程度令人叹服。你再看往他手上洒的洗手水，都是滤过的香花水。少女们又扶他坐在一个象牙椅上，而且在服侍他的过程中始终一声不响。她们又为他端来各种佳肴，全都美味可口，骑士竟不知该从何下着。他吃饭的时候还可以听到音乐声，却不知是谁在演奏，在哪里演奏。餐毕撤掉了桌子，骑士躺到椅子上，习惯地剔起牙来。忽然，另一个美人走进客厅，坐在骑士身旁，向他讲述那是一座什么样的城堡，自己又是如何被魔法弄进城堡的等等，无论是骑士还是小说的读者都会为之惊奇。\\n\\n “我不想再冗述下去了。不过由此可以看出，无论什么人，无论读到游侠骑士小说的哪一部分，都会感到愉快和惊奇。请您相信我，就像我刚才说的，读读这些小说，就会知道它如何能够驱除烦恼，陶冶性情。\\n\\n “就我而言，可以说我是个勇敢大胆、谦恭有礼、豪爽大方、温文尔雅、颇有教养、吃苦耐劳、忍受魔法的游侠骑士。虽然我刚刚还像疯子似的被关在笼子里，我想，凭我臂膀的力量和老天保佑，我很快就会成为某个王国的国王，那时候我就可以显示出我知恩图报，胸襟宽广。大人，我相信穷人永远无法向任何人表示他的慷慨豪情，尽管他对此有强烈的愿望。只停留在愿望上的感激之心只能算是死物，就好比有信心而无行动只能算死物一样。因此我希望命运能够赐予我一个做皇帝的机会，这样就可以向我的朋友们行善，以此显示我的胸怀，特别是我这位可怜的侍从桑乔，我很早以前就曾许愿给他一个伯爵称号。我现在只担心他没有能力管理好他的封邑。”\\n\\n 桑乔听见了主人最后几句话，于是说道：\\n\\n “您加把劲，唐吉诃德大人，赶紧把您许过愿的伯爵领地封给我吧，我早等着呢。我觉得我有能力管好它。就算是管不好，我听说有人愿承租领主的土地，每年交一定的租子，而领主们就撒手不管了，只管收租子，其他一概不管。我也这么做，什么都不操心，什么都不管，跟伯爵似的，只管收租子，其他的事随便他们怎么办。”\\n\\n “可是，桑乔兄弟，”牧师说，“你可以只管收你的租子，但是政务总得有人管理呀。一个领主必须懂得治国，这也需要才智和判断力，特别是要有决断力。如果开头就出现了错误，那么中期和后期阶段也肯定会出现错误。上帝常常帮助好心的老实人，而不帮助狡猾的坏人。”\\n\\n “我不懂得那些大道理，”桑乔说，“我只知道若是把伯爵的领地拿到手，我也同样能当好伯爵，管好领地。我的脑子与别人比也不差，身体还很强壮，完全可以像别人一样管理好我的领土。只要我当上领主，我就要为所欲为；为所欲为了，我就称心了；称心了，我就高兴；一个人如果高兴了，就会别无他求，也就行了，其他的都像两个瞎子说再见一样，全是胡扯。”\\n\\n “你称之为大道理的那些东西并不坏，桑乔，而且关于伯爵领地的事，里面还有很多学问呢。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德插嘴道：\\n\\n “我不知道还有什么学问，我只知道学习高卢伟大的阿马迪斯的榜样。阿马迪斯曾把菲尔梅封给他的侍从，我也会这样。我会一百个放心地封桑乔做伯爵。桑乔是游侠骑士的最优秀的侍从中的一位。”\\n\\n 牧师对唐吉诃德成套的胡言乱语，对他描述骑士的湖中奇遇，对他把骑士小说上看到的那些乱七八糟的东西记得一清二楚，深感惊奇。此外，牧师没有料到桑乔竟会如此愚蠢，竟如此渴望他主人许愿给他的伯爵领地。这时，牧师那几个到客店去牵驮驴的佣人回来了，并且在绿草地上铺了块毯子摆上食物。大家在树荫下就地坐下来吃东西，因为赶牛车的人还想在这个地方喂喂他的牛呢。大家正吃着，忽听得他们身旁的草丛中传来一阵急促的跑动声和铃铛响，只见从那儿窜出一只漂亮的山羊，羊身上是黑色、白色和棕褐色的斑点。羊的身后有个羊倌在大声呼喊，用他那种惯用语叫羊站住或回到羊群里去。那只惊慌失措的小羊看到这些人仿佛看到了救星，跑到他们面前停了下来。羊倌过来，抓住了羊的两只角，仿佛它真能听懂人话似的对它说道：\\n\\n “哎呀，小野羊啊小野羊，小花羊啊小花羊，你怎么到处乱跑！是狼把你吓着了吗，宝贝？你为什么不告诉我，这是怎么回事？不管怎么样，你是母羊，却总不能安分下来。你的脾气不好，还不学好样。回去吧，回去吧，朋友，至少你待在圈里或同你的伙伴们在一起，才会安全。你总是这样到处乱跑，其它羊会怎么样呢？”\\n\\n 大家听了羊倌这番话都觉得很有意思，特别是牧师。他对羊倌说：\\n\\n “兄弟，你先静静气，先别急着把羊赶回去。就像你刚才说的，它是只母羊，母羊就该有它的天性，不管你愿意不愿意都没用。你喝点酒吃口肉，压压火，也让羊歇歇。”\\n\\n 牧师说着用刀尖扎着一块兔子里脊肉递给了羊倌。羊倌接过肉，道了谢，吃完又喝了口酒。平静下来之后，他说道：\\n\\n “我不希望你们因为看见我如此认真地同羊说话，就把我看成傻子。我刚才那些话是话里有话的。我虽然是个粗人，可是还不至于连如何对待人和畜生都不懂。”\\n\\n “这点我完全相信，”神甫说，“而且根据我的经验，大山里面有学士，牧人茅屋里出哲学家。”\\n\\n “至少出吃过亏的人。”羊倌说，“我虽然是不请自来，但为了使你们相信这点，如果你们不讨厌，我希望你们花点功夫听我给你们讲一件事，你们就会知道我和这位大人，”羊倌指指神甫，“说的都是真的。”\\n\\n 这时唐吉诃德说：\\n\\n “看来这件事还有点骑士征险的意思。所以，就我而言，兄弟，我非常愿意听。这几位大人也很愿意听那些既新鲜又开心的事，我想你讲的事情肯定就属于这类。讲吧，朋友，我们都听你讲。”\\n\\n “我除外，”桑乔说，“我想拿着这些馅饼到小溪那边去吃，得吃够三天的。我听我的主人唐吉诃德大人说过，游侠骑士的侍从有吃的时候要拼命吃，否则万一走进深山老林，很可能许多天都出不来。如果不吃足了，或者备足了干粮，就会变成干尸，这是常有的事。”\\n\\n “你做得对，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你随便到哪儿去，能吃多少就吃多少。我已经吃饱了，现在只需要再给我的精神一些给养，所以我要听听这位好人讲的故事。”\\n\\n “我们都需要这种给养。”牧师说。\\n\\n 牧师请羊倌开始讲。羊倌本来抓着羊角，现在却在羊背上拍了两下，对羊说道：\\n\\n “在我身边趴下，小花羊，咱们先不着急回羊圈去。”\\n\\n 小羊似乎明白了主人的话。羊倌刚坐下，它就在羊倌身旁趴下来，脸朝向主人，似乎在认真听羊倌说话。于是，羊倌开始讲起来。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4618.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
