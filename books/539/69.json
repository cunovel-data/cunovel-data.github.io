{"id":42209,"no":69,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 15","content":"Don Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highest degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he fancied him of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he expected to learn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued; inasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of ceasing to be one, to return and render him an account of what took place between him and her. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the Mirrors of another, for he just then had no thought of anything but finding some village where he could plaster himself, as has been said already. The history goes on to say, then, that when the bachelor Samson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote to resume his knight-errantry which he had laid aside, it was in consequence of having been previously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means to be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet without worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures; at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on the special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go, as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sally forth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for there would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that being looked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and settled that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor. Then, Don Quixote being vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command him to return to his village and his house, and not quit it for two years, or until he received further orders from him; all which it was clear Don Quixote would unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or fail to observe the laws of chivalry; and during the period of his seclusion he might perhaps forget his folly, or there might be an opportunity of discovering some ready remedy for his madness. Carrasco undertook the task, and Tom Cecial, a gossip and neighbour of Sancho Panza’s , a lively, feather-headed fellow, offered himself as his squire. Carrasco armed himself in the fashion described, and Tom Cecial, that he might not be known by his gossip when they met, fitted on over his own natural nose the false masquerade one that has been mentioned; and so they followed the same route Don Quixote took, and almost came up with him in time to be present at the adventure of the cart of Death and finally encountered them in the grove, where all that the sagacious reader has been reading about took place; and had it not been for the extraordinary fancies of Don Quixote, and his conviction that the bachelor was not the bachelor, senor bachelor would have been incapacitated for ever from taking his degree of licentiate, all through not finding nests where he thought to find birds. Tom Cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry end their expedition had come to, said to the bachelor, “Sure enough, Senor Samson Carrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan and set about an enterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to come well out of it. Don Quixote a madman, and we sane; he goes off laughing, safe, and sound, and you are left sore and sorry! I’d like to know now which is the madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so of his own choice?” To which Samson replied, “The difference between the two sorts of madmen is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, while he who is so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he likes.” “In that case,” said Tom Cecial, “I was a madman of my own accord when I volunteered to become your squire, and, of my own accord, I’ll leave off being one and go home.” “That’s your affair,” returned Samson, “but to suppose that I am going home until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing is absurd; and it is not any wish that he may recover his senses that will make me hunt him out now, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with my ribs won’t let me entertain more charitable thoughts.” Thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where it was their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the unfortunate Samson was cured. Tom Cecial left him and went home, while he stayed behind meditating vengeance; and the history will return to him again at the proper time, so as not to omit making merry with Don Quixote now. 唐吉诃德由于战胜了如此勇敢的镜子骑士而傲慢自负，得意极了。他现在只等着从那个骑士嘴里得知他的夫人是否仍然受到魔法的控制。如果那个战败的骑士还算是骑士，就得回来告诉他有关杜尔西内亚的情况。不过，唐吉诃德的想法是这样，而镜子骑士的想法却如刚才说的那样，想先找个地方上点药膏。 故事说参孙·卡拉斯科学士曾劝唐吉诃德继续进行其未竟的骑士事业，其实，他事先已同神甫和理发师商量了既能让唐吉诃德安安静静地待在家里，又不影响他那倒霉的征险想法。卡拉斯科提出一个建议，大家一致赞同，那就是干脆先把唐吉诃德放出去，因为让唐吉诃德留在家里几乎是不可能的；然后，参孙扮成游侠骑士的模样，在半路上与唐吉诃德交战。参孙肯定会打败唐吉诃德，这样事情就好办多了。在唐吉诃德战败后，学士骑士可以命令他返回自己的家乡，在家里待两年，不许再出来，除非是学士骑士另有吩咐。唐吉诃德战败后肯定会履行诺言，从而不违犯骑士界的规定。在家里的这段时间里，也许唐吉诃德会忘记自己的狂妄之念，或者找到治疗他的疯病的合适办法。 卡拉斯科愿意充当骑士，而桑乔的一位老弟和邻居托梅·塞西亚尔，一位生性快活、头脑正常的人，则自告奋勇扮成侍从。参孙就像前面谈到的那样披挂了盔甲，而托梅·塞西亚尔则在自己的鼻子上安了个假鼻子，以免与他的老朋友碰面时被认出来。他们沿着唐吉诃德走过的路线行进。唐吉诃德路遇死神之车的时候，他们已几乎赶上唐吉诃德了。最后，他们在森林里追上了唐吉诃德，才发生了细心的读者前面已经看到的事情。要不是唐吉诃德突发奇想，认为学士并不是那个学士，这位打错了算盘的学士恐怕就永远也当不上教士了。托梅·塞西亚尔见他们的如意计划半路搁浅，对学士说道： “参孙·卡拉斯科大人，咱们真是罪有应得。人们常常想得容易，匆忙动手，结果却很难实现。唐吉诃德疯疯癫癫，咱们神志正常，结果他倒安然无恙地笑着走了，您却浑身是伤，满心忧愁。咱们现在得搞清楚，到底谁更算是疯子，是身不由己疯了的人，还是自愿充当疯子的人？” 参孙回答说： “两种疯子之间的区别在于，身不由己疯了的人永远是疯子，而自愿充当疯子的人想不疯时就可以不疯。” “既然这样，”托梅·塞西亚尔说，“我自己想当您的侍从，属于自愿充当疯子的人。现在我不想再当疯子了，我要回家去。” “随你的便，”参孙说，“但不把唐吉诃德痛打一顿，就休想让我回家。我现在找他不是想让他恢复神志了，而是要找他报仇。我的肋骨还疼着呢，我不会饶了他。” 两人说着话，来到一个正巧有正骨医生的村镇上。参孙在医生那儿治了自己的伤。托梅·塞西亚尔离开他回家了。参孙仍在考虑报仇的事。此时故事及时转向，让读者先拿唐吉诃德开开心再说吧。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4636.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
