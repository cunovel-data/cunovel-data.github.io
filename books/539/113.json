{"id":42253,"no":113,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 59","content":"A clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved Don Quixote and Sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite behaviour of the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned Dapple and Rocinante loose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair, master and man, seated themselves. Sancho had recourse to the larder of his alforjas and took out of them what he called the prog; Don Quixote rinsed his mouth and bathed his face, by which cooling process his flagging energies were revived. Out of pure vexation he remained without eating, and out of pure politeness Sancho did not venture to touch a morsel of what was before him, but waited for his master to act as taster. Seeing, however, that, absorbed in thought, he was forgetting to carry the bread to his mouth, he said never a word, and trampling every sort of good breeding under foot, began to stow away in his paunch the bread and cheese that came to his hand.\n \n “Eat, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote; “support life, which is of more consequence to thee than to me, and leave me to die under the pain of my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes. I was born, Sancho, to live dying, and thou to die eating; and to prove the truth of what I say, look at me, printed in histories, famed in arms, courteous in behaviour, honoured by princes, courted by maidens; and after all, when I looked forward to palms, triumphs, and crowns, won and earned by my valiant deeds, I have this morning seen myself trampled on, kicked, and crushed by the feet of unclean and filthy animals. This thought blunts my teeth, paralyses my jaws, cramps my hands, and robs me of all appetite for food; so much so that I have a mind to let myself die of hunger, the cruelest death of all deaths.”\n “So then,” said Sancho, munching hard all the time, “your worship does not agree with the proverb that says, ‘Let Martha die, but let her die with a full belly.’ I, at any rate, have no mind to kill myself; so far from that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, who stretches the leather with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants. I’ll stretch out my life by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it; and let me tell you, senor, there’s no greater folly than to think of dying of despair as your worship does; take my advice, and after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this green grass-mattress, and you will see that when you awake you’ll feel something better.”\n Don Quixote did as he recommended, for it struck him that Sancho’s reasoning was more like a philosopher’s than a blockhead’s , and said he, “Sancho, if thou wilt do for me what I am going to tell thee my ease of mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not so great; and it is this; to go aside a little while I am sleeping in accordance with thy advice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, to give thyself three or four hundred lashes with Rocinante’s reins, on account of the three thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for the disenchantment of Dulcinea; for it is a great pity that the poor lady should be left enchanted through thy carelessness and negligence.”\n “There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Sancho; “let us both go to sleep now, and after that, God has decreed what will happen. Let me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in cold blood is a hard thing, especially if the stripes fall upon an ill-nourished and worse-fed body. Let my lady Dulcinea have patience, and when she is least expecting it, she will see me made a riddle of with whipping, and ‘until death it’s all life;’ I mean that I have still life in me, and the desire to make good what I have promised.”\n Don Quixote thanked him, and ate a little, and Sancho a good deal, and then they both lay down to sleep, leaving those two inseparable friends and comrades, Rocinante and Dapple, to their own devices and to feed unrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was furnished. They woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumed their journey, pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight, apparently a league off. I say an inn, because Don Quixote called it so, contrary to his usual practice of calling all inns castles. They reached it, and asked the landlord if they could put up there. He said yes, with as much comfort and as good fare as they could find in Saragossa. They dismounted, and Sancho stowed away his larder in a room of which the landlord gave him the key. He took the beasts to the stable, fed them, and came back to see what orders Don Quixote, who was seated on a bench at the door, had for him, giving special thanks to heaven that this inn had not been taken for a castle by his master. Supper-time came, and they repaired to their room, and Sancho asked the landlord what he had to give them for supper. To this the landlord replied that his mouth should be the measure; he had only to ask what he would; for that inn was provided with the birds of the air and the fowls of the earth and the fish of the sea.\n “There’s no need of all that,” said Sancho; “if they’ll roast us a couple of chickens we’ll be satisfied, for my master is delicate and eats little, and I’m not over and above gluttonous.”\n The landlord replied he had no chickens, for the kites had stolen them.\n “Well then,” said Sancho, “let senor landlord tell them to roast a pullet, so that it is a tender one.”\n “Pullet! My father!” said the landlord; “indeed and in truth it’s only yesterday I sent over fifty to the city to sell; but saving pullets ask what you will.”\n “In that case,” said Sancho, “you will not be without veal or kid.”\n “Just now,” said the landlord, “there’s none in the house, for it’s all finished; but next week there will he enough and to spare.”\n “Much good that does us,” said Sancho; “I’ll lay a bet that all these short-comings are going to wind up in plenty of bacon and eggs.”\n “By God,” said the landlord, “my guest’s wits must he precious dull; I tell him I have neither pullets nor hens, and he wants me to have eggs! Talk of other dainties, if you please, and don’t ask for hens again.”\n “Body o’ me!” said Sancho, “let’s settle the matter; say at once what you have got, and let us have no more words about it.”\n “In truth and earnest, senor guest,” said the landlord, “all I have is a couple of cow-heels like calves’ feet, or a couple of calves’ feet like cowheels; they are boiled with chick-peas, onions, and bacon, and at this moment they are crying ‘Come eat me, come eat me.”\n “I mark them for mine on the spot,” said Sancho; “let nobody touch them; I’ll pay better for them than anyone else, for I could not wish for anything more to my taste; and I don’t care a pin whether they are feet or heels.”\n “Nobody shall touch them,” said the landlord; “for the other guests I have, being persons of high quality, bring their own cook and caterer and larder with them.”\n “If you come to people of quality,” said Sancho, “there’s nobody more so than my master; but the calling he follows does not allow of larders or store-rooms; we lay ourselves down in the middle of a meadow, and fill ourselves with acorns or medlars.”\n Here ended Sancho’s conversation with the landlord, Sancho not caring to carry it any farther by answering him; for he had already asked him what calling or what profession it was his master was of.\n Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was next to Don Quixote’s , with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, he overheard these words, “As you live, Senor Don Jeronimo, while they are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of ‘Don Quixote of La Mancha.’”\n The instant Don Quixote heard his own name be started to his feet and listened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, “Why would you have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone who has read the First Part of the history of ‘Don Quixote of La Mancha’ to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?”\n “For all that,” said he who was addressed as Don Juan, “we shall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.”\n On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his voice and said, “Whoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.”\n “Who is this that answers us?” said they in the next room.\n “Who should it be,” said Sancho, “but Don Quixote of La Mancha himself, who will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges don’t trouble a good payer.”\n Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms round Don Quixote’s neck, said to him, “Your appearance cannot leave any question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your appearance; unquestionably, senor, you are the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught your achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you has done;” and with this he put a book which his companion carried into the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, “In the little I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve to be censured. The first is some words that I have read in the preface; the next that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he writes without articles; and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is that he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of the history, for here he says that my squire Sancho Panza’s wife is called Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but Teresa Panza; and when a man errs on such an important point as this there is good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the history.”\n “A nice sort of historian, indeed!” exclaimed Sancho at this; “he must know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife Teresa Panza, Mari Gutierrez; take the book again, senor, and see if I am in it and if he has changed my name.”\n “From your talk, friend,” said Don Jeronimo, “no doubt you are Sancho Panza, Senor Don Quixote’s squire.”\n “Yes, I am,” said Sancho; “and I’m proud of it.”\n “Faith, then,” said the gentleman, “this new author does not handle you with the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you out a heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very different being from the Sancho described in the First Part of your master’s history.”\n “God forgive him,” said Sancho; “he might have left me in my corner without troubling his head about me; ‘let him who knows how ring the bells; ‘Saint Peter is very well in Rome.’”\n The two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have supper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn fit for one of his sort. Don Quixote, who was always polite, yielded to their request and supped with them. Sancho stayed behind with the stew. and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head of the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no less fond of cow-heel and calves’ feet than Sancho was.\n While at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he had of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or was she with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving her modesty and delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of Senor Don Quixote?\n To this he replied, “Dulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion more firmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and her beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;” and then he proceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment of Dulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of Montesinos, together with what the sage Merlin had prescribed for her disenchantment, namely the scourging of Sancho.\n Exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from hearing Don Quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; and if they were amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the elegant style in which he delivered them. On the one hand they regarded him as a man of wit and sense, and on the other he seemed to them a maundering blockhead, and they could not make up their minds whereabouts between wisdom and folly they ought to place him.\n Sancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the X condition, repaired to the room where his master was, and as he came in said, “May I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships have got has any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton (according to what your worships say) I wish he may not call me drunkard too.”\n “But he does,” said Don Jeronimo; “I cannot remember, however, in what way, though I know his words are offensive, and what is more, lying, as I can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy Sancho before me.”\n “Believe me,” said Sancho, “the Sancho and the Don Quixote of this history must be different persons from those that appear in the one Cide Hamete Benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my master valiant, wise, and true in love, and I simple, droll, and neither glutton nor drunkard.”\n “I believe it,” said Don Juan; “and were it possible, an order should be issued that no one should have the presumption to deal with anything relating to Don Quixote, save his original author Cide Hamete; just as Alexander commanded that no one should presume to paint his portrait save Apelles.”\n \n “Let him who will paint me,” said Don Quixote; “but let him not abuse me; for patience will often break down when they heap insults upon it.”\n “None can be offered to Senor Don Quixote,” said Don Juan, “that he himself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward it off with the shield of his patience, which, I take it, is great and strong.”\n A considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort, and though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the book to see what it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, saying that he treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by any chance it should come to its author’s ears that he had it in his hand, he did not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had read it; for our thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep themselves aloof from what is obscene and filthy.\n They asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, to Saragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that city every year. Don Juan told him that the new history described how Don Quixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at the ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume, though rich in sillinesses.\n “For that very reason,” said Don Quixote, “I will not set foot in Saragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the lie of this new history writer, and people will see that I am not the Don Quixote he speaks of.”\n “You will do quite right,” said Don Jeronimo; “and there are other jousts at Barcelona in which Senor Don Quixote may display his prowess.”\n “That is what I mean to do,” said Don Quixote; “and as it is now time, I pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed, and to place and retain me among the number of your greatest friends and servants.”\n “And me too,” said Sancho; “maybe I’ll be good for something.”\n With this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired to their room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the medley he made of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt thoroughly convinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author described, were the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote rose betimes, and bade adieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition of the other room. Sancho paid the landlord magnificently, and recommended him either to say less about the providing of his inn or to keep it better provided.\n \n 唐吉诃德和桑乔遭受了公牛的非礼之后，一路风尘，来到了树林间的一泓清泉边。他们为驴和马摘掉了笼头，任其游荡。主仆二人坐下来，桑乔从他藏食品的褡裢里拿出了一些他称为熟肉的食物。唐吉诃德漱了口，洗了脸，清凉了一下，觉得精神爽快些了。他心中烦闷，没有吃东西；桑乔仅仅是出于礼貌才没动摆在自己面前的东西，主人没吃，他也不敢先尝。可是，他见主人只管自己想心事，根本就没想去拿面包，也就不顾什么规矩了，一声不吭地拿起面包和奶酪往肚子里填。\n “吃吧，桑乔朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“你得维持生命，这比我维持自己的生命更重要。我忧心忡忡，厄运不断，干脆让我死掉算了。桑乔，我生来就是虽生犹死，而你呢，是为死而吃。为了让你知道我说的是实话，你不妨想想，我这个人史书有载，武艺有名，行为有礼，王宫有请，姑娘有求，总之，我本来应该由于我的英勇业绩而得到桂冠，取得英名，可是今天上午我却被那些粗野无礼的牲畜踩得浑身疼痛。现在，我的牙崩了，手也麻了，完全没有胃口了。所以，我想还是让自己饿死算了，这是一种最残酷的死亡方式。”\n “可我觉得，”桑乔说，“有句俗语，您大概不会赞成，就是说‘死也要当饱死鬼’。至少我不想把自己饿死，相反，我倒想像皮匠那样。皮匠用牙齿把皮子咬住，尽可能地拉长。我也会拼命吃，尽力延长我的生命，一直到气数已尽。您应该知道，大人，世界上再没有比像您这样绝望更傻的事了。还是听我的吧，吃完东西以后在这片绿草垫子上睡一会儿，醒来后您就会觉得好一些。”\n 唐吉诃德觉得桑乔这几句话不仅不傻，倒有点哲学家的味道，便同意了。不过，他对桑乔说道：\n “喂，桑乔，如果你能按照我现在说的去做，我的心情就会轻松一些，不那么难受。那就是当我按照你说的去睡觉的时候，你往远处走一点儿，解开衣服，用罗西南多的缰绳抽打自己三四百下。要想让杜尔西内亚摆脱魔法，你还差三千多下呢。由于你的疏忽，她现在仍然受着魔法的折磨，这是多大的憾事呀。”\n “这事可得从长计议，”桑乔说，“咱们俩现在还是先睡觉，然后再说吧。您该知道，让一个人狠狠抽打自己，这可不是简单的事情，更何况是个腹中空空的人呢。我的女主人杜尔西内亚夫人还是耐心点儿吧，也许她在某个意想不到的时候发现我已经被打得百孔千疮了。‘不死就有日子’，我是说，只要我还活着，我就愿意实现我的诺言。”\n 唐吉诃德对此表示感谢，然后吃了点儿东西。桑乔吃得可不少。吃完后，两人倒地睡觉，任凭那两头牲口在肥沃的草地上随意啃青。他们醒来时天色已渐晚，两人便赶紧骑上牲口继续赶路，想尽快赶到一西里外的一个客店去。我这里说客店是因为唐吉诃德称它为客店，而没有像以往那样把所有的客店都称为城堡。\n 他们来到客店，问店主是否还有房间。店主说不仅有，而且条件很好，在萨拉戈萨可称是独占鳌头。两人从马背和驴背上翻身跃下。店主给了桑乔一把钥匙，桑乔把他们带的食物放到一个房间里，又把两匹牲口牵到马厩里，喂了些草料，然后出来看唐吉诃德还有什么吩咐。唐吉诃德正坐在一个石凳上。桑乔特别感谢老天，他的主人这次没把客店当成城堡。到了吃晚饭的时间，两人回到他们的房间。桑乔问店主，晚饭有什么可吃的，店主回答说，那要看客人的口味了，可以说想吃什么有什么，从天上的飞鸟到地上的家禽，还有海里的鱼，应有尽有。\n “用不了那么多，”桑乔说，“我们俩只要有两只烤鸡就够了。我的主人身体不舒服，吃不多，我吃得也不是特别多。”\n 店主说没有鸡，鸡都被老鹰叼走了。\n “那么，您就去让他们烤一只嫩母鸡吧。”桑乔说。\n “母鸡？我的妈呀！”店主说，“实话告诉你，我昨天把五十多只母鸡都拿到城里卖掉了。除了母鸡，你随便要什么都可以。”\n “那么，”桑乔说，“牛犊肉或羊羔肉总该有吧。”\n “现在客店里没有，”店主说，“没有是因为用完了。不过，下星期有的是。”\n “这下可好了，”桑乔说，“这也没有，那也没有，咸肉和鸡蛋总该有吧？”\n “我的天哪，”店主说，“这位客人可真够笨的。我刚才说过这儿没有母鸡，你怎么还想要鸡蛋呢？你再想想，还有什么好吃的，可以要点儿美味的东西。”\n “我的天哪，这么办吧，”桑乔说，“店主大人，你说说你这儿有什么吧，我们也不用再考虑了。”\n “我有两只牛犊蹄一般大小的老牛蹄，或者说两只像老牛蹄一般大小的牛犊蹄，现在正煮着呢。我已经加了豆子、葱头和咸肉。这会儿它们正叫着：快来吃我吧，快来吃我吧。”\n “那么现在我们就要它，谁也不许再要了。”桑乔说，“我一定出比别人多的价钱。我最喜欢吃这种东西了。无论什么蹄子我都爱吃。”\n “没有人会再要的，”店主说，“因为我这里的其他客人都很有身份，他们都自己带着厨师、管理员和原料。”\n “若论有身份，”桑乔说，“谁也不如我的主人有身份。不过，他所从事的职业不允许他带着食物和饮料。我们躺在草地上吃橡子或野果就饱了。”\n 桑乔同店主的谈话到此为止，因为店主问桑乔他的主人是干什么的，桑乔就不愿意再往下说了。到了吃晚饭的时候，唐吉诃德仍留在房间里。店主把那锅牛蹄端来，自己也坐下来大大方方地一起吃。这个房间同隔壁那个房间似乎只隔着一堵薄墙。唐吉诃德听到那个房间里有人在说话：\n “亲爱的唐赫罗尼莫大人，趁现在还没有送晚饭来，咱们还是看看《唐吉诃德》的下卷吧。”\n 一听到提起自己的名字，唐吉诃德立刻站起来，仔细倾听他们的谈话。只听得那个唐赫罗尼莫大人说道：\n “唐胡安大人，您为什么要看那些胡言乱语呢？凡是读过《唐吉诃德》上卷的人都知道，这部小说索然无味，那么下卷还会有什么意思呢？”\n “尽管如此，”唐胡安说，“还是看看为好。无论哪本书，都是开卷有益。不过，我最不满意的就是书上说，唐吉诃德已经不再忠于托博索的杜尔西内亚了。”\n 唐吉诃德闻言勃然大怒，说道：\n “无论是谁，只要他说曼查的唐吉诃德抛弃了托博索的杜尔西内亚，我就要同他拼命，让他知道这纯粹是一派胡言！唐吉诃德根本不可能抛弃杜尔西内亚。杜尔西内亚也不可能被唐吉诃德抛弃，她不会被任何人抛弃。唐吉诃德并不是那种见异思迁的人，而且他的职业也不允许他移情别处。”\n “谁在听我们说话？”隔壁有人说道。\n “还能有谁呢，”桑乔说，“只能是曼查的唐吉诃德本人。他说到就能做到，更何况他‘既然能还帐，就不怕抵押’呢。”\n 桑乔刚说完，就看见两个骑士装束的人进了房门。其中一人搂住唐吉诃德的脖子说道：\n “见了您，果然名不虚传。而您的盛名又使您不虚此行。确切无疑，您就是真正的唐吉诃德，是游侠骑士的北斗星和指路明灯。有的人竟想顶替您的英名，诋毁您的功绩，就像这本书的作者那样，只能是徒劳一场。”\n 那人说着把同伴手里的一本书交给唐吉诃德。唐吉诃德接过来，一言不发，翻了翻书，过了一会儿才说道：\n “我只随便翻了一下，便发现作者有三点不堪一击。首先是序言上的几句话；其次是作者的阿拉贡语风，他写东西时有些地方没用冠词；第三点就是主要情节不符合事实。例如，这儿说我的侍从桑乔·潘萨的妻子叫玛丽·古铁雷斯，其实她叫特雷莎·潘萨。既然在这么重要的地方都有误，其他地方的谬误就可想而知了。”\n 桑乔说道：\n “这种人算什么呀！居然把我老婆特雷莎·潘萨说成是玛丽·古铁雷斯！大人，您再翻翻书，看看书里是不是有我的名字，是不是把我的名字也改了？”\n “朋友，听你说话这口气，”唐赫罗尼莫说，“你肯定就是唐吉诃德大人的侍从桑乔·潘萨了？”\n “正是我，”桑乔说，“我为此感到骄傲。”\n “实话对你讲，”那人说道，“这位作者并没有把你如实写出来。他把你描述成一个贪吃的笨蛋，一点儿也不滑稽，与写你主人那本书上卷里的桑乔完全不同。”\n “愿上帝饶恕他吧，”桑乔说，“他完全可以不写我嘛。不知道就别乱说，事情该怎么样就是怎么样。”\n 那两个人请唐吉诃德到他们房间去与他们共进晚餐。他们很清楚，那个客店里没有什么适合唐吉诃德吃的东西。唐吉诃德不便推辞，就很有礼貌地过去同他们一起吃晚饭，于是这锅牛蹄就成桑乔的了。桑乔坐到了上首位置，店主也挨着他坐下来。他同桑乔一样对蹄类食品很感兴趣。\n 吃晚饭时，唐胡安向唐吉诃德打听有关杜尔西内亚的情况，问他们是否已经结婚，杜尔西内亚是否怀孕了，或者仍是个处女。如果她仍守身如玉，那么，她对唐吉诃德也肯定一往情深。唐吉诃德答道：\n “杜尔西内亚仍然完好如初，我对她也比以往任何时候都忠贞。我们之间的联系同以前一样，并不频繁，不过，她的花容月貌现在已变成一个丑陋的农妇模样了。”\n 接着，唐吉诃德讲述了杜尔西内亚中魔法以及他在蒙特西诺斯洞窟内看到的情况，还提到了贤人梅尔林曾吩咐过，若想让杜尔西内亚摆脱魔法，就得让桑乔自己鞭笞自己。那两个人听唐吉诃德讲述他的这些奇遇觉得非常有意思，同时又对他能把这些乱七八糟的东西讲得有声有色感到惊奇。他一会儿讲得有条有理，一会儿又讲得糊里糊涂，让人搞不清他到底是明白人还是疯子。\n 桑乔吃完晚饭，撇下那个已经醉倒的店主，来到唐吉诃德所在的房间，进门便说道：\n “我敢拿生命打赌，诸位大人，你们看的那本书的作者肯定是跟我过不去。他把我说成了馋鬼，但愿他别再把我称为醉鬼。”\n “他的确把你说成醉鬼，”唐赫罗尼莫说，“但我忘记是怎么说的了，我只知道说得挺不好的。不过，我亲眼见到了眼前这位桑乔，就知道那全是胡说八道。”\n “请你们诸位相信，你们看的那本书里的桑乔和唐吉诃德大概是另外两个人，而不是锡德·哈迈德·贝嫩赫利写的书里的桑乔和唐吉诃德。我们是贝嫩赫利写的唐吉诃德和桑乔。我的主人勇敢、机智而又多情，我单纯、滑稽，既不贪吃也不贪杯。”“我也这样认为。”唐胡安说，“如果可能的话，应该下令除了原作者锡德·哈迈德之外，任何人都不许记述伟大的唐吉诃德的事情，就像亚历山大下令除了阿佩莱斯①之外，任何人都不许画他的像一样。”\n ①阿佩莱斯是古希腊时代早期的画家，曾为马其顿的腓力二世及其子亚历山大大帝充当宫廷画师。\n “谁愿意写我就写吧，”唐吉诃德说，“但是不要丑化我。\n 污蔑太多往往会导致让人失去耐心。”\n “若不是唐吉诃德大人这么有耐心，”唐胡安说，“我估计他这种耐心是相当大的，恐怕没有什么污蔑可以逃脱他的反击。”\n 大家说着话消磨了大半夜，虽然唐胡安想让唐吉诃德再翻翻那本书，看看还有什么可说的，最终却未能如愿。唐吉诃德说，就算他把全书都看了，也只能说是满篇荒谬，而且，万一传到那本书作者的耳朵里，说唐吉诃德见过那本书，他就该得意了，还以为唐吉诃德通读了那本书呢。人心里应该干净，眼睛里更应该干净。那两个人问唐吉诃德准备到哪儿去，唐吉诃德说要到萨拉戈萨去参加一年一度的盔甲擂台赛。唐胡安说，那本书里讲到唐吉诃德或其他什么人曾参加了一次穿环擂台赛，写得毫无新意，缺乏文采，没有特点，全是一派胡言。”\n “如果情况是这样，”唐吉诃德说，“我就不去萨拉戈萨了，这样就可以揭穿作者的谎言，让人们知道我并不是他说的那个唐吉诃德。”\n “您做得很对，”唐赫罗尼莫说，“在巴塞罗那另外还有其他一些比赛，您可以在那儿显示您的风采。”\n “我也想这样。”唐吉诃德说，“现在是睡觉的时候了，请原谅，我要上床休息了。请你们务必把我当成你们的一位老朋友和侍者。”\n “我也如此，”桑乔说，“也许什么时候我能为你们做点儿事情。”\n 他们互相道别，唐吉诃德和桑乔回到了自己的房间，剩下唐胡安和唐赫罗尼莫仍在那里为看到唐吉诃德既明智又疯癫而发呆。他们确信，这两个人就是真正的唐吉诃德和桑乔，而不是那位阿拉贡作者杜撰的那两个。\n 第二天早晨，唐吉诃德用手拍打着隔壁房间的薄墙，向那两个人告别。桑乔慷慨地向店主付了钱，让店主少吹牛，多置办些东西。\n \n
