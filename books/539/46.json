{"id":42186,"no":46,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 45","content":"What do you think now, gentlemen,” said the barber, “of what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?”\n “And whoever says the contrary,” said Don Quixote, “I will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.”\n Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote’s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other barber he said:\n “Senor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers’ arms; and I say — saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments — that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber’s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.”\n “Certainly not,” said Don Quixote, “for half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.”\n “It is quite true,” said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis’s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings.\n “God bless me!” exclaimed their butt the barber at this; “is it possible that such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin but a helmet? Why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole university, however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a helmet, why, then the pack-saddle must be a horse’s caparison, as this gentleman has said.”\n “To me it looks like a pack-saddle,” said Don Quixote; “but I have already said that with that question I do not concern myself.”\n “As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,” said the curate, “it is only for Senor Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all these gentlemen and I bow to his authority.”\n “By God, gentlemen,” said Don Quixote, “so many strange things have happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have sojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively in reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my belief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment. The first time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble, nor did Sancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last night I was kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowing how or why I came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forward to give an opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash decision. As regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a helmet I have already given an answer; but as to the question whether this is a pack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give a positive opinion, but will leave it to your worships’ better judgment. Perhaps as you are not dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of this place have nothing to do with you, and your faculties are unfettered, and you can see things in this castle as they really and truly are, and not as they appear to me.”\n “There can be no question,” said Don Fernando on this, “but that Senor Don Quixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision of this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will take the votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly and fully.”\n To those who were in the secret of Don Quixote’s humour all this afforded great amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it seemed the greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four servants of Don Luis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to three other travellers who had by chance come to the inn, and had the appearance of officers of the Holy Brotherhood, as indeed they were; but the one who above all was at his wits’ end, was the barber basin, there before his very eyes, had been turned into Mambrino’s helmet, and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt whatever was about to become a rich caparison for a horse. All laughed to see Don Fernando going from one to another collecting the votes, and whispering to them to give him their private opinion whether the treasure over which there had been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison; but after he had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote, he said aloud, “The fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired collecting such a number of opinions, for I find that there is not one of whom I ask what I desire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this is the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay, of a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and your ass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have stated and proved your case very badly.”\n “May I never share heaven,” said the poor barber, “if your worships are not all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to me a pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, ‘laws go,’ — I say no more; and indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.”\n The simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the absurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed:\n “There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to him, and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.”\n But said one of the four servants, “Unless, indeed, this is a deliberate joke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men so intelligent as those present are, or seem to be, can venture to declare and assert that this is not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as I perceive that they do assert and declare it, I can only come to the conclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is so opposed to the evidence of experience and truth itself; for I swear by” — and here he rapped out a round oath — “all the people in the world will not make me believe that this is not a barber’s basin and that a jackass’s pack-saddle.”\n “It might easily be a she-ass’s ,” observed the curate.\n “It is all the same,” said the servant; “that is not the point; but whether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.”\n On hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood, who had been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to restrain his anger and impatience, exclaimed, “It is a pack-saddle as sure as my father is my father, and whoever has said or will say anything else must be drunk.”\n “You lie like a rascally clown,” returned Don Quixote; and lifting his pike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow at his head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have stretched him at full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against the ground, and the rest of the officers, seeing their comrade assaulted, raised a shout, calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood. The landlord, who was of the fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff of office and his sword, and ranged himself on the side of his comrades; the servants of Don Luis clustered round him, lest he should escape from them in the confusion; the barber, seeing the house turned upside down, once more laid hold of his pack-saddle and Sancho did the same; Don Quixote drew his sword and charged the officers; Don Luis cried out to his servants to leave him alone and go and help Don Quixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who were supporting him; the curate was shouting at the top of his voice, the landlady was screaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping, Dorothea was aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Dona Clara in a faint. The barber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luis gave one of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep him from escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took his part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was belabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing but cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps, sword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the midst of all this chaos, complication, and general entanglement, Don Quixote took it into his head that he had been plunged into the thick of the discord of Agramante’s camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn like thunder, he cried out:\n “Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to me as they value their lives!”\n All paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, “Did I not tell you, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of devils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with your own eyes how the discord of Agramante’s camp has come hither, and been transferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there for the sword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for the helmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then, you, Senor Judge, and you, senor curate; let the one represent King Agramante and the other King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by God Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as we are should slay one another for such trifling cause.” The officers, who did not understand Don Quixote’s mode of speaking, and found themselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their companions, were not to be appeased; the barber was, however, for both his beard and his pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle; Sancho like a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master; while the four servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw how little they gained by not being so. The landlord alone insisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn raised a disturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for the present; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment, and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote’s imagination.\n All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the Judge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him to return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter with them, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the curate as to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it stood, and what Don Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length that Don Fernando should tell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that it was his desire that Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia, where he would receive from the marquis his brother the welcome his quality entitled him to; for, otherwise, it was easy to see from the determination of Don Luis that he would not return to his father at present, though they tore him to pieces. On learning the rank of Don Fernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it between themselves that three of them should return to tell his father how matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon Don Luis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or his father’s orders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the enemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made a fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.\n It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the rank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the contest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one against Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to satisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote’s features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search of, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick reader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and went on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. As soon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the warrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the collar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted aloud, “Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it in earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested.”\n The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true, and that it agreed with Don Quixote’s appearance, who, on his part, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown, worked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking with rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all his might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold. The landlord, who had perforce to support his brother officers, ran at once to aid them. The landlady, when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh quarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was immediately caught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling upon heaven and all present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, “By the Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments of this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!”\n Don Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual contentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the coat collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this, however, the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help, and deliver him over bound into their power, as was required for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on whose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber and footpad of the highways.\n Don Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly, “Come now, base, ill-born brood; call ye it highway robbery to give freedom to those in bondage, to release the captives, to succour the miserable, to raise up the fallen, to relieve the needy? Infamous beings, who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven should not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry, or show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow, not to say the presence, of any knight-errant! Come now; band, not of officers, but of thieves; footpads with the licence of the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a knight as I am? Who was he that did not know that knights-errant are independent of all jurisdictions, that their law is their sword, their charter their prowess, and their edicts their will? Who, I say again, was the fool that knows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that confer such privileges or exemptions as a knight-errant acquires the day he is dubbed a knight, and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry? What knight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen’s pin-money, king’s dues, toll or ferry? What tailor ever took payment of him for making his clothes? What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him pay his shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What damsel was not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there, or will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give, single-handed, four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhood if they come in his way?”\n \n “诸位大人，”理发师说，“这两位绅士仍然坚持说这不是铜盆，而是头盔。你们看看到底是什么？”\n “谁要是说它不是头盔，”唐吉诃德说，“我都会让他承认自己是在撒谎。不管他是骑士还是侍从，都是在说弥天大谎。”\n 我们熟悉的那位理发师也在场。他十分了解唐吉诃德的脾气，想让他把洋相出得再大点，好拿他开心，逗大家笑，于是他对这位理发师说：\n “理发师大人，或者不管你是什么人吧，你该知道我和你是同行。我领取考试合格证已经二十多年了，对各种理发工具全都熟悉。我年轻时也当过一阵兵，知道什么是头盔，什么是顶盔，什么是套盔，以及各种军事用品，我是说战士用的各种物品。如果没有其他高见，那么我的看法就算高见了。我说这位杰出的大人在我们面前拿的这个东西，不仅不是理发师用的盆，而且远远不是，就好像黑的同白的、真理和谎言是截然不同的两回事一样。我说它是个头盔，不过是个不完整的头盔。”\n “的确是个不完整的头盔，”唐吉诃德说，“还缺少护脸的那一半。”\n “是这样。”神甫已经明白了他这位朋友的意图，也这么说。\n 卡德尼奥、费尔南多和他的伙伴们也都随声附和。法官若不是还在想同唐路易斯的事，也会帮腔的。不过他正在认真考虑自己的事，很少或根本没有顾及这些人如何胡闹。\n “上帝保佑！”这位受到愚弄的理发师说，“怎么可能这么多有身份的人都说这不是盆而是头盔呢？这事太蹊跷了，无论谁听了都会感到惊奇。好吧，假如按照这位大人说的，这个盆就是头盔，那么这个驮鞍就是全套马具了。”\n “我觉得它是马具，”唐吉诃德说，“不过我说过，这件事我不插嘴。”\n “到底是驮鞍还是马具，全由唐吉诃德大人说了算。”神甫说，“凡是与骑士有关的事情，我们都听他的。”\n “上帝保佑，大人们，”唐吉诃德说，“我在这座城堡里住了两次，竟遇到了这么多奇怪的事情，以至于我都不敢对这里的任何事情下定论了。我觉得这里所有的东西都中了邪。第一次在这儿留宿的时候，这儿一个会魔法的摩尔人把我折腾得够呛，桑乔也被他的随从们搞得不善。昨天晚上，我一只胳膊被吊了两个小时，竟不知为什么会倒这个霉。所以，现在让我对这个疑团下结论，未免太冒失。刚才有人说这是盆，不是头盔，我已经反驳过了。可要问那究竟是驮鞍还是马具，我还不敢妄下结论，还要请诸位各抒高见。你们同我不一样，不是受封的骑士，不会受这儿的魔法影响，思维也不受什么约束，可以按照事情的本来面目，而不是按照我的看法来判断这座城堡里的事情。”\n “不错，”费尔南多这时说，“唐吉诃德大人说得很对，这件事应该由我们来评断。为了可靠起见，我将秘密征求大家的意见，然后把结果照实公布。”\n 对于那些拿唐吉诃德开心的人来说，这是个最大的笑料，可那些不知实情的人便觉得这真是天下最荒唐的事情了，特别是唐路易斯和他的佣人，以及另外三个偶然来到客店的客人。他们看样子像圣友团的团丁，而且确实也是。不过最感到绝望的还是理发师，他的铜盆竟眼睁睁地在那些人面前变成了曼布里诺的头盔，而且他想，那个驮鞍肯定也会变成贵重的马鞍。费尔南多分别跟几个人交头接耳，悄悄问他们，大家争执不休的那个宝贝究竟是驮鞍还是马具。大家乐不可支地看他到底能得出什么样的结论。费尔南多向那几个了解唐吉诃德底细的人征求过意见之后高声说道：\n “好心人，现在的情况是，我不想再继续征求意见了，因为凡是我问过的人都认为，说这个东西是驮鞍太荒唐了。这不仅是马具，而且是纯种马的马具。现在你不要着急，尽管你和你的驴不愿意，这还是马具而不是驮鞍，你的看法是非常错误的。”\n “我没有糊涂，”理发师说，“而是你们搞错了。我在上帝面前也这么认为。上帝也会认为这是驮鞍，不是马具。不过法律……我不说了。反正我没醉，我连早饭还没吃呢。反正我没说错。”\n 理发师的固执像唐吉诃德的荒唐一样逗得大家哄笑起来。唐吉诃德这时候说道：\n “现在只好各执己见了。人各有志，不可强求。”\n 四个佣人中有一个说道：\n “如果这不是有意开玩笑，我简直不能相信，这些很明白的人，或者看来很明白的人，怎么会硬说这不是盆，那不是驮鞍。不过我看他们都是一口咬定，坚持把它们说成是与事实相反的东西，这其中必有奥妙。我向天发誓，”他随即坚决地发誓，“即使世界上所有人都这么说，我也不会相信这不是理发师的盆，不是公驴的驮鞍。”\n “很可能是母驴的驮鞍。”神甫说。\n “那倒无所谓，”佣人说，“问题不在这儿，问题在于它到底是不是像他们说的那样是驮鞍。”\n 有个团丁刚才听到了他们的争论，一听佣人这话，走了进来，怒气冲冲地说道：\n “驮鞍就是驮鞍，就像我父亲就是我父亲一样，谁要不这么说，就是喝多了。”\n “你这个恶棍，竟敢胡说八道。”唐吉诃德说。\n 唐吉诃德说着举起了他那时刻不离手的长矛，向团丁头上打去。若不是团丁躲得快，他就被打倒了。长矛碰到地上断成了几截。几个团丁见自己的同伴被打，立刻高声向圣友团呼救。\n 店主也是圣友团成员。他立刻跑进屋里拿了棍子和剑，和自己的同伴们站到了一起；唐路易斯的四个佣人围住了唐路易斯，怕他趁乱跑掉；理发师见客店大乱，就抓起驮鞍，可是桑乔也抓住不放；唐吉诃德持剑向团丁进攻；唐路易斯大声呼喊他的佣人们放开自己，去帮助唐吉诃德，他还叫卡德尼奥和费尔南多都去为唐吉诃德助威；神甫大喊大叫；客店主妇连声呼喊；她的女儿痛心不已；丑女仆哭个不停；多罗特亚不知所措；卢辛达呆若木鸡；而唐娜克拉拉早晕过去了。理发师用棍子打桑乔，桑乔猛烈地还击理发师；唐路易斯的一个佣人怕唐路易斯跑了，就抓住他一只胳膊，结果唐路易斯一拳打去，打得那佣人满嘴是血；法官连忙去护着佣人；费尔南多把一个团丁打倒在地，把他痛痛快快地踢了一顿；店主又提高了嗓门向圣友团呼救，结果客店里有人连哭带喊，有人惊恐不安，有人无辜遭殃，有人挥拳拔剑，拳打脚踢，人们打得头破血流，到处都是一片狼藉。混乱之中，唐吉诃德的脑海里忽然绘声绘影地闪现出阿格拉曼特阵地①的混乱场面，于是他大喝一声，震动了客店：\n “都住手，放下武器，安静点儿！要是想保命的话就听我说！”\n ①阿格拉曼特是意大利诗人阿里奥斯托的叙事诗《疯狂的奥兰多》中摩尔王特罗亚诺的儿子，进攻巴黎时，死于奥兰多之手。此后，以“阿格拉曼特阵地”来形容混乱的场面。\n 他这一喊，大家全停住了。他又接着说道：\n “诸位，我不是对你们说过，这座城堡已经被魔法控制，恐怕已经魔鬼成群了吗？为了证明这点，我想让你们亲眼看看阿格拉曼特阵地的混乱已经转移到了这里。你们看看，有的争剑，有的夺马，有的抢老鹰，有的要头盔，真是互不相让。法官大人，请您过来，还有您，神甫大人，也请您过来。一个人当阿格拉曼特国王，一个当索布利诺国王，让我们握手言和吧。我向全能的上帝发誓，咱们这么有身份的人在这儿为了这些小事而互相残杀，真是太愚蠢了。”\n 几个团丁并不明白唐吉诃德说的到底是什么意思。他们只觉得自己在费尔南多、卡德尼奥和他的同伴那儿吃了亏，不肯罢休。理发师倒是不想闹了，在刚才的格斗中他的胡子被揪掉了，驮鞍也被弄坏了。桑乔是个好侍从，唐吉诃德稍一吩咐，他就服从了；唐路易斯的四个佣人知道再闹下去对他们没什么好处，也就不说什么了；只有店主因为唐吉诃德总是在客店里惹是生非，坚持要对他进行惩罚。最后，这场混乱总算平息下来了。然而，在唐吉诃德的印象里，他至死都认为驮鞍就是马具，铜盆就是头盔，而客店就是城堡。\n 在法官和神甫的劝说下，大家都平静下来，握手言和。唐路易斯的几个佣人又坚持让唐路易斯同他们一起回去。就在唐路易斯同他们商量的时候，法官也把唐路易斯对他说的那些话告诉了费尔南多、卡德尼奥和神甫，并且同他们商量如何处理这件事情。最后他们商定，由费尔南多向唐路易斯的佣人们说明自己的身份，以及他想让唐路易斯同自己一起到安达卢西亚去，他的兄弟侯爵大人肯定不会亏待唐路易斯。这次就是把唐路易斯撕成碎片，他也不会回去见他的父亲。四个佣人知道费尔南多的身份和唐路易斯的决心后，决定三个人回去向唐路易斯的父亲报告情况，一个人留下来侍候唐路易斯，同时别让他跑了，直到那几个人回来找他们，或者唐路易斯的父亲另有吩咐。\n 于是，这场纷争凭借阿格拉曼特的威望和索布利诺的忍让终于平息下来。可是和谐与平安的死敌见自己受到了蔑视和嘲弄，刚才把大家闹得乱成一团却没捞到什么好处，就想再挑起一次新的争端。\n 那几个团丁隐约听说了与他们打斗的那几个人的身份后，觉得再打下去，只能吃更多亏，也就不再吵闹了。可是那个被费尔南多痛打的团丁忽然想起自己身上还带着几份捉拿罪犯的通缉令，其中一张就是捉拿唐吉诃德的。看来桑乔的担心很对，圣友团因为唐吉诃德释放了划船苦役犯，正在缉拿他。想到此，那个团丁就要核对一下唐吉诃德的特征。他从怀里掏出几张羊皮纸通缉令，找到唐吉诃德那张，慢慢看起来。他的阅读能力不强，看一句通缉令，抬头看一眼唐吉诃德，核对通缉令上形容的特征是否符合唐吉诃德。最后，他确定这就是通缉令要找的那个人。一经核实，他马上把其他羊皮纸通缉令都收起来，左手拿着唐吉诃德的那张，右手紧紧抓住唐吉诃德的衣领，紧得让唐吉诃德快要喘不过气来了。\n 他大声说：\n “快来帮助圣友团！大家看清楚，我可不是在开玩笑。你们看看这张通缉令，上面说要缉拿这个拦路抢劫的强盗。”\n 神甫拿过通缉令一看，团丁说的果然是真的，通缉令上描绘的特征与唐吉诃德完全相符。唐吉诃德见这个坏蛋竟敢如此对待自己，立刻气得七窍生烟！他用双手紧紧掐住了团丁的脖子。若不是其他几个团丁赶来，这个团丁不仅没抓住唐吉诃德，反而把自己的性命也搭上了。\n 店主当然要帮助圣友团自己人，便马上赶来了。客店主妇见丈夫又参与打斗，就又喊起来。喊声引来了丑女仆和店主的女儿，这两个人又赶紧祈求老天和在场的人援助。桑乔见状说道：\n “永恒的上帝，看来我的主人说得完全对，这座城堡的确中了魔法，简直一刻也不得安宁！”\n 费尔南多怕唐吉诃德和团丁闹出事来，赶紧过来劝架。那两个人一人抓住对方的衣领，一个掐着对方的脖子，都抓得很紧。费尔南多掰开了两个人的手，可是团丁们并没有因此就不抓逃犯了。他们请求大家帮忙把唐吉诃德捆起来交给他们，这样才能算为国王尽忠，为圣友团效力。他们以圣友团的名义再次请求大家，把这个拦路强盗抓起来。唐吉诃德听到这话笑了。他不慌不忙地说道：\n “过来，你们这些没有教养的贱民！给戴锁链者以自由，释放囚犯，扶弱济贫，帮助受难者，你们竟把这称作拦路抢劫？你们这些卑贱的东西，真是智能低下。老天竟没有告诉你们游侠骑士的高尚和你们的愚味无知，你们竟敢污辱游侠骑士的形象，而且还当着游侠骑士的面？\n “过来，我看你们不像团丁，倒像匪帮，你们是打着圣友团旗号的拦路强盗！告诉我，谁这么无知，竟敢签发捉拿像我这样的骑士的通缉令？他竟无知到不懂得游侠骑士不受任何法律的管辖，他们的剑就是法律，他们的精神就是法典，他们的意志就是法规？我再说一遍，谁这么愚蠢，竟不知道游侠骑士自从受封后投身于这个艰苦职业之日起，所享受的特权和豁免权比贵族证书上规定的还要多？哪个游侠骑士付过贸易税、王后税①、王威税②、河流通行税等各种捐税？哪个裁缝为他们做衣服还要钱？哪个国王不邀请他们做客？哪个姑娘不倾慕他们，心甘情愿地投入他们的怀抱？一句话，过去、现在和将来，世界上什么时代的骑士不能冲他面前的四百个团丁打上四百大棍？”\n ①国王结婚时臣民缴纳的税。\n ②臣民每七年缴纳一次，以示服从国王的威严。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4613.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote ,
