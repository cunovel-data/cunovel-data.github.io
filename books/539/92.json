{"id":42232,"no":92,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 38","content":"Following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as twelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robes apparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long that they allowed only the border of the robe to be seen. Behind them came the Countess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading her by the hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that, had it a nap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea; the tail, or skirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in three points which were borne up by the hands of three pages, likewise dressed in mourning, forming an elegant geometrical figure with the three acute angles made by the three points, from which all who saw the peaked skirt concluded that it must be because of it the countess was called Trifaldi, as though it were Countess of the Three Skirts; and Benengeli says it was so, and that by her right name she was called the Countess Lobuna, because wolves bred in great numbers in her country; and if, instead of wolves, they had been foxes, she would have been called the Countess Zorruna, as it was the custom in those parts for lords to take distinctive titles from the thing or things most abundant in their dominions; this countess, however, in honour of the new fashion of her skirt, dropped Lobuna and took up Trifaldi. The twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace, their faces being covered with black veils, not transparent ones like Trifaldin’s , but so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them. As soon as the band of duennas was fully in sight, the duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-moving procession. The twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along which the Distressed One advanced, Trifaldin still holding her hand. On seeing this the duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote went some twelve paces forward to meet her. She then, kneeling on the ground, said in a voice hoarse and rough, rather than fine and delicate, “May it please your highnesses not to offer such courtesies to this your servant, I should say to this your handmaid, for I am in such distress that I shall never be able to make a proper return, because my strange and unparalleled misfortune has carried off my wits, and I know not whither; but it must be a long way off, for the more I look for them the less I find them.” “He would be wanting in wits, senora countess,” said the duke, “who did not perceive your worth by your person, for at a glance it may be seen it deserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of polite usage;” and raising her up by the hand he led her to a seat beside the duchess, who likewise received her with great urbanity. Don Quixote remained silent, while Sancho was dying to see the features of Trifaldi and one or two of her many duennas; but there was no possibility of it until they themselves displayed them of their own accord and free will. All kept still, waiting to see who would break silence, which the Distressed Duenna did in these words: “I am confident, most mighty lord, most fair lady, and most discreet company, that my most miserable misery will be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generous and condolent in your most valiant bosoms, for it is one that is enough to melt marble, soften diamonds, and mollify the steel of the most hardened hearts in the world; but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing, not to say your ears, I would fain be enlightened whether there be present in this society, circle, or company, that knight immaculatissimus, Don Quixote de la Manchissima, and his squirissimus Panza.” “The Panza is here,” said Sancho, before anyone could reply, “and Don Quixotissimus too; and so, most distressedest Duenissima, you may say what you willissimus, for we are all readissimus to do you any servissimus.” On this Don Quixote rose, and addressing the Distressed Duenna, said, “If your sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge in any hope of relief from the valour or might of any knight-errant, here are mine, which, feeble and limited though they be, shall be entirely devoted to your service. I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose calling it is to give aid to the needy of all sorts; and that being so, it is not necessary for you, senora, to make any appeal to benevolence, or deal in preambles, only to tell your woes plainly and straightforwardly: for you have hearers that will know how, if not to remedy them, to sympathise with them.” On hearing this, the Distressed Duenna made as though she would throw herself at Don Quixote’s feet, and actually did fall before them and said, as she strove to embrace them, “Before these feet and legs I cast myself, O unconquered knight, as before, what they are, the foundations and pillars of knight-errantry; these feet I desire to kiss, for upon their steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune, O valorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse the fabulous ones of the Amadises, Esplandians, and Belianises!” Then turning from Don Quixote to Sancho Panza, and grasping his hands, she said, “O thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant in this present age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than the beard of Trifaldin my companion here of present, well mayest thou boast thyself that, in serving the great Don Quixote, thou art serving, summed up in one, the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in the world. I conjure thee, by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness, that thou wilt become my kind intercessor with thy master, that he speedily give aid to this most humble and most unfortunate countess.” To this Sancho made answer, “As to my goodness, senora, being as long and as great as your squire’s beard, it matters very little to me; may I have my soul well bearded and moustached when it comes to quit this life, that’s the point; about beards here below I care little or nothing; but without all these blandishments and prayers, I will beg my master (for I know he loves me, and, besides, he has need of me just now for a certain business) to help and aid your worship as far as he can; unpack your woes and lay them before us, and leave us to deal with them, for we’ll be all of one mind.” The duke and duchess, as it was they who had made the experiment of this adventure, were ready to burst with laughter at all this, and between themselves they commended the clever acting of the Trifaldi, who, returning to her seat, said, “Queen Dona Maguncia reigned over the famous kingdom of Kandy, which lies between the great Trapobana and the Southern Sea, two leagues beyond Cape Comorin. She was the widow of King Archipiela, her lord and husband, and of their marriage they had issue the Princess Antonomasia, heiress of the kingdom; which Princess Antonomasia was reared and brought up under my care and direction, I being the oldest and highest in rank of her mother’s duennas. Time passed, and the young Antonomasia reached the age of fourteen, and such a perfection of beauty, that nature could not raise it higher. Then, it must not be supposed her intelligence was childish; she was as intelligent as she was fair, and she was fairer than all the world; and is so still, unless the envious fates and hard-hearted sisters three have cut for her the thread of life. But that they have not, for Heaven will not suffer so great a wrong to Earth, as it would be to pluck unripe the grapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface. Of this beauty, to which my poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice, countless princes, not only of that country, but of others, were enamoured, and among them a private gentleman, who was at the court, dared to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty, trusting to his youth, his gallant bearing, his numerous accomplishments and graces, and his quickness and readiness of wit; for I may tell your highnesses, if I am not wearying you, that he played the guitar so as to make it speak, and he was, besides, a poet and a great dancer, and he could make birdcages so well, that by making them alone he might have gained a livelihood, had he found himself reduced to utter poverty; and gifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down a mountain, not to say a tender young girl. But all his gallantry, wit, and gaiety, all his graces and accomplishments, would have been of little or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil, had not the impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first. First, the villain and heartless vagabond sought to win my good-will and purchase my compliance, so as to get me, like a treacherous warder, to deliver up to him the keys of the fortress I had in charge. In a word, he gained an influence over my mind, and overcame my resolutions with I know not what trinkets and jewels he gave me; but it was some verses I heard him singing one night from a grating that opened on the street where he lived, that, more than anything else, made me give way and led to my fall; and if I remember rightly they ran thus: From that sweet enemy of mine My bleeding heart hath had its wound; And to increase the pain I’m bound To suffer and to make no sign. The lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup; and afterwards, I may say ever since then, looking at the misfortune into which I have fallen, I have thought that poets, as Plato advised, ought to he banished from all well-ordered States; at least the amatory ones, for they write verses, not like those of ‘The Marquis of Mantua,’ that delight and draw tears from the women and children, but sharp-pointed conceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns, and like the lightning strike it, leaving the raiment uninjured. Another time he sang: Come Death, so subtly veiled that I Thy coming know not, how or when, Lest it should give me life again To find how sweet it is to die. — and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant when sung and fascinate when written. And then, when they condescend to compose a sort of verse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy, which they call seguidillas! Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks forth, and the body grows restless and all the senses turn quicksilver. And so I say, sirs, that these troubadours richly deserve to be banished to the isles of the lizards. Though it is not they that are in fault, but the simpletons that extol them, and the fools that believe in them; and had I been the faithful duenna I should have been, his stale conceits would have never moved me, nor should I have been taken in by such phrases as ‘in death I live,’ ‘in ice I burn,’ ‘in flames I shiver,’ ‘hopeless I hope,’ ‘I go and stay,’ and paradoxes of that sort which their writings are full of. And then when they promise the Phoenix of Arabia, the crown of Ariadne, the horses of the Sun, the pearls of the South, the gold of Tibar, and the balsam of Panchaia! Then it is they give a loose to their pens, for it costs them little to make promises they have no intention or power of fulfilling. But where am I wandering to? Woe is me, unfortunate being! What madness or folly leads me to speak of the faults of others, when there is so much to be said about my own? Again, woe is me, hapless that I am! it was not verses that conquered me, but my own simplicity; it was not music made me yield, but my own imprudence; my own great ignorance and little caution opened the way and cleared the path for Don Clavijo’s advances, for that was the name of the gentleman I have referred to; and so, with my help as go-between, he found his way many a time into the chamber of the deceived Antonomasia (deceived not by him but by me) under the title of a lawful husband; for, sinner though I was, would not have allowed him to approach the edge of her shoe-sole without being her husband. No, no, not that; marriage must come first in any business of this sort that I take in hand. But there was one hitch in this case, which was that of inequality of rank, Don Clavijo being a private gentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I said, heiress to the kingdom. The entanglement remained for some time a secret, kept hidden by my cunning precautions, until I perceived that a certain expansion of waist in Antonomasia must before long disclose it, the dread of which made us all there take counsel together, and it was agreed that before the mischief came to light, Don Clavijo should demand Antonomasia as his wife before the Vicar, in virtue of an agreement to marry him made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in such binding terms that the might of Samson could not have broken it. The necessary steps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady’s confession; she confessed everything in full, and he ordered her into the custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court.” “Are there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,” said Sancho at this, “and poets, and seguidillas? I swear I think the world is the same all over! But make haste, Senora Trifaldi; for it is late, and I am dying to know the end of this long story.” “I will,” replied the countess. 十二个妇人排成两行，跟在那几个忧伤的吹鼓手后面走进了花园。她们身上穿着宽大的丧服，丧服像是一种类似哔叽的绒布做的，她们头上披着细白布长巾，只露出丧服的一点儿饰边。侍从“白胡子三摆”牵着“三摆裙伯爵夫人”的手跟在后面。夫人穿的是极细密的黑色台面呢，如果用刷子卷刷一下，那结成的卷儿肯定比马托斯出产的鹰嘴豆还大。她的所谓“三尾”或“三摆”都是尖形的，由三个身着丧服的侍童提着，三个三角形构成了一个引人注目的几何图形。看到这尖摆裙，所有人都明白她为什么叫“三摆裙伯爵夫人”了。据贝嫩赫利说，她确实是由此得名为“三摆裙伯爵夫人”的，其实按照她的本名，她应该叫“母狼伯爵夫人”。当地习惯于以某人领地上最多的东西来称呼他。如果这位夫人的领地上狐狸多，就会叫她“狐狸伯爵夫人”。不过，这位夫人为了突出她的裙子，没有叫“母狼伯爵夫人”，而是叫“三摆裙伯爵夫人”。 十二个女佣和伯爵夫人迈着稳重的步伐行进。女佣们脸上都蒙着黑纱，不过不像伯爵夫人的黑纱那样透明，而是很厚实，让人一点儿也看不见黑纱后面的东西。这一行人刚一出现，公爵、公爵夫人和唐吉诃德就站了起来。其他人见到这一队人也都站了起来。十二个女佣停住了脚步，让开一条路，“三摆裙伯爵夫人”从后面走上前来，拉着“白胡子三摆”的手依然没有松开。公爵、公爵夫人和唐吉诃德上前十几步去迎接这位夫人。这时，伯爵夫人跪到地上，不是细声细气而是粗声粗气地说道： “诸位大人，对你们的仆人，对你们这个女佣，不必过分客气。我是忧伤人，不懂得还礼，我的天大不幸已使我不知魂归何处了，大概已经跑到很远的地方去了。我越是寻找，越找不到。” “伯爵夫人，”公爵说，“如果有谁没发现您的风雅，那才是有眼无珠呢。您的雍容华贵和文质彬彬是有目共睹的。” 公爵拉着伯爵夫人的手，请她站起来，让她坐到公爵夫人身旁的一把椅子上。公爵夫人也非常客气地请她坐下。唐吉诃德默不作声。桑乔却急于看到“三摆裙夫人”和那些女佣的面孔。不过，除非那些人自愿把脸露出来，否则桑乔是根本不可能看到的。 大家都静静地等着，看谁先开口。最后，还是忧伤妇人先开了腔： “最尊贵的大人，最美丽的夫人，最机智的各位先生，我相信我的最大痛苦已经在你们宽广的胸怀里引起了最深切的同情。我的痛苦足以让大理石动情，让钻石伤感，让世界上最冷酷的心牵肠挂肚。不过，在我讲述我的痛苦经历之前，我希望你们能告诉我，最曼查最正直的骑士唐吉诃德和他的最侍从桑乔是否在你们这里。” “桑乔在这里，”桑乔不等别人答话就抢先说道，“那个最唐吉诃德也在这里。所以，最忧伤的贵妇人，您最可以畅所欲言，我们大家都最愿意为您效劳。” 唐吉诃德这时站了起来，对忧伤妇人讲道： “忧伤妇人，如果某位游侠骑士的勇气和力量有希望使您摆脱痛苦，那么我愿意用我的菲薄之力为您效劳。我就是曼查的唐吉诃德。我的任务就是帮助各种各样的落难者。所以，您不必感恩戴德地拐弯抹角，请您把您的痛苦直截了当地说出来吧。我们听了以后即使不能帮助您，至少也会对您表示同情。” 忧伤妇人闻言扑到唐吉诃德脚下，然后又抱住他的脚说： “我要扑倒在您脚下，无敌的骑士！这双脚是游侠骑士的支柱。我想吻这双脚，解脱我的痛苦全得靠这双脚迈出的步伐。勇敢的游侠骑士，您的光辉事迹使阿马迪斯、埃斯普兰蒂安和贝利亚尼斯的传奇般的业绩都相形见绌！” 说完她又转向桑乔，拉着桑乔的手说： “你是古往今来最忠实地为游侠骑士效劳的侍从，你的恩德比我的伙伴‘白胡子三摆’的胡子还长！你完全可以因为你为伟大的唐吉诃德效劳，从而为全世界所有从武的游侠骑士效了劳而感到骄傲！你忠实善良，因此我请求你帮我恳求你的主人，让他救助我这个卑微不幸的伯爵夫人吧。” 桑乔回答说： “夫人，我的恩德是不是像您的侍从的胡子那样长，我倒不在乎。关键是来世我的灵魂还得有胡子，至于现在的胡子怎么样，我倒是无所谓的，或者说根本没关系。您用不着百般请求，我一定会请我的主人尽力帮助您。我知道我的主人非常喜欢我，更何况他现在还需要我帮忙为他做件事呢。您可以把您的痛苦都讲出来，咱们不妨商量商量。” 公爵、公爵夫人和其他知情人顿时笑出了声。他们暗自称赞“三摆裙夫人”善于随机应变，而且装得惟妙惟肖。“三摆裙夫人”重新又坐下，说道： “在特拉波瓦纳和南海之间，离科摩林角两西里外的地方有个著名的坎达亚王国，由阿奇彼拉国王的遗孀唐娜马贡西娅管理。阿奇彼拉国王和唐娜马贡西娅有个公主叫安东诺玛霞，她是这个王国的继承人。安东诺玛霞是由我带大的，我是她母亲手下资格最老、作用最大的女佣。 “天来日往，安东诺玛霞长到了十四岁。她长得太美了，美得不能再美了。她很聪明，但那时还是孩子式的聪明。她既聪明又漂亮，简直可以说是世界上最漂亮的人。她现在也是世界上最美丽的人，除非嫉妒美丽的命运和狠毒的命运女神①割断了她的生命线。不过，老天不会允许，也不应该允许人间出现这样的罪恶，那就等于是把人间最甜美的葡萄在还没成熟的时候摘了下来。这位美丽的姑娘，都怪我嘴笨，不能把她的美貌形容出来，她引起了国内外无数王孙公子的爱慕。其中有京城的一位男子，自恃貌美有钱而且多才多艺，竟然对姑娘想入非非。如果你们不讨厌的话，我可以告诉你们，他弹起吉他来如歌如诉，而且他不仅会作诗，还会跳舞。他还会做鸟笼子，以后如果生活上窘困，他光靠做鸟笼子就能维持生活。他的这些本领完全可以倾倒一座大山，就更别说倾倒一个姑娘了。可是，这个不要脸的家伙若不用计策首先攻破我这一关，他的所有那些才能就很难或者根本不可能征服姑娘这座堡垒。这个心术不正的家伙想首先打通我这一关，博取我的欢心，好让我这个糊涂看门人把我看守的这座堡垒的钥匙交给他。总之，他用一些小首饰笼络我，买通了我。不过，最令我俯首听命的还是一天晚上我听到他唱的一首歌。我的住处的一扇窗户就对着他住的那条小巷。如果我没记错的话，歌词是这样的： ①命运女神共有三个，共同掌管人的生命之线，一个纺，一个量，一个剪。 我那甜蜜的冤家对头 把我的心灵伤透， 纵然倍受煎熬， 苦不堪言，我仍极力忍受。 “当时我觉得这歌词字字珠玑，歌声似蜜，从那以后我才知道了这类诗的害处。我觉得应该像柏拉图建议的那样，在正经八摆的国家里把那些诗人驱逐出境，至少是那些写坏诗的人。这种人的诗不像曼图亚侯爵的诗那样，能为儿童和妇女带来欢乐和眼泪，却只能产生害处，就像软刀子一样刺穿你的灵魂，或者像闪电一样，虽然并没损害人的衣服，却已伤害了人的灵魂。他还唱道： 让死亡不知不觉 悄悄来临吧， 死亡的快乐 也不能重新给我生命。 “这类歌的歌声让人心旷神怡，歌词让人如痴如醉。如果将这类词句改写成那种在坎达亚颇为流行的塞基迪亚，又会怎么样呢？那就会让人神魂颠倒、嬉笑无常和坐立不宁，总之一句话，人就像抽了疯似的。所以我说，诸位大人把这类诗人驱逐到拉加托岛①去完全是名正言顺的。不过这也不怪他们，全怪那些吹捧他们、相信他们的笨蛋。如果我是个好管家，就不会相信他们那些陈腐的观念和骗人的谎话，什么‘我在死亡里生活’，‘在冰块里燃烧’，‘在火里发抖’，‘毫无希望地期待’，‘我走了依然留下’，以及其他这类根本不着边际的东西。他们还动不动就许给你长生鸟、阿里阿德涅的北冕星座②、太阳车上的马、南海的珍珠、台伯河的黄金，以及潘卡亚的香脂等等，结果又怎么样呢？反正他们大笔一挥，不费什么力气就许诺了很多连想都想不出，而且也根本办不到的东西。可是，我扯到哪儿去了？我这个人真糟糕，自己这么多事还没说呢，怎么倒数落起别人的过错来了？我这个人真糟糕，那些诗并没能征服我，倒是我自己的单纯征服了我。那些音乐并没能打动我的心，倒是我自己的轻浮动摇了我。我的愚昧无知和缺少警惕为克拉维霍打开了方便之门，克拉维霍就是我刚才说的那个男子。我成了他们的中间人。他一次又一次以安东诺玛霞真正丈夫的名义来到安东诺玛霞的房间。安东诺玛霞实际上不是受克拉维霍的骗，而是受了我的骗。但我虽然有错，如果不是她丈夫，我决不会让别人沾她的边儿！ ①关押重犯的岛屿，位于牙买加西侧。 ②阿里阿德涅是希腊神话中一女神，后升天化为北冕星座。 “这不行，我要管这种事，他们无论如何也得结婚！他们的这桩婚事里只有一点不好，就是两人地位不平等。克拉维霍是个普通男子，而安东诺玛霞公主则是这个王国的继承人。我精心策划这件事，可是后来安东诺玛霞的肚子鼓了起来，吓得我们三个人赶紧商量对策，决定在事情还没有败露之前，先让公主出一张愿意做克拉维霍妻子的字据，由我来证明，铁证如山，就是大力士参孙也推不翻，然后再让克拉维霍拿着这张字据去找教区牧师，请求允许安东诺玛霞做他的妻子。牧师看了字据，又听了公主的忏悔，公主说出了实情，于是他吩咐把公主送到京城一个很正直的小官吏家里藏起来……” 桑乔这时说： “原来在坎达亚也有官吏，也有诗人和塞基迪亚呀。我敢说，世界上哪儿都一样。不过，‘三摆裙夫人’，您快点讲吧，时间不早了，我特别想知道这个长长故事的结局呢。” “那我就讲下去，”伯爵夫人说。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4659.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
