{"id":42258,"no":118,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 64","content":"The wife of Don Antonio Moreno, so the history says, was extremely happy to see Ana Felix in her house. She welcomed her with great kindness, charmed as well by her beauty as by her intelligence; for in both respects the fair Morisco was richly endowed, and all the people of the city flocked to see her as though they had been summoned by the ringing of the bells.\\n\\n Don Quixote told Don Antonio that the plan adopted for releasing Don Gregorio was not a good one, for its risks were greater than its advantages, and that it would be better to land himself with his arms and horse in Barbary; for he would carry him off in spite of the whole Moorish host, as Don Gaiferos carried off his wife Melisendra.\\n\\n “Remember, your worship,” observed Sancho on hearing him say so, “Senor Don Gaiferos carried off his wife from the mainland, and took her to France by land; but in this case, if by chance we carry off Don Gregorio, we have no way of bringing him to Spain, for there’s the sea between.”\\n\\n “There’s a remedy for everything except death,” said Don Quixote; “if they bring the vessel close to the shore we shall be able to get on board though all the world strive to prevent us.”\\n\\n “Your worship hits it off mighty well and mighty easy,” said Sancho; “but ‘it’s a long step from saying to doing;’ and I hold to the renegade, for he seems to me an honest good-hearted fellow.”\\n\\n Don Antonio then said that if the renegade did not prove successful, the expedient of the great Don Quixote’s expedition to Barbary should be adopted. Two days afterwards the renegade put to sea in a light vessel of six oars a-side manned by a stout crew, and two days later the galleys made sail eastward, the general having begged the viceroy to let him know all about the release of Don Gregorio and about Ana Felix, and the viceroy promised to do as he requested.\\n\\n One morning as Don Quixote went out for a stroll along the beach, arrayed in full armour (for, as he often said, that was “his only gear, his only rest the fray,” and he never was without it for a moment), he saw coming towards him a knight, also in full armour, with a shining moon painted on his shield, who, on approaching sufficiently near to be heard, said in a loud voice, addressing himself to Don Quixote, “Illustrious knight, and never sufficiently extolled Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am the Knight of the White Moon, whose unheard-of achievements will perhaps have recalled him to thy memory. I come to do battle with thee and prove the might of thy arm, to the end that I make thee acknowledge and confess that my lady, let her be who she may, is incomparably fairer than thy Dulcinea del Toboso. If thou dost acknowledge this fairly and openly, thou shalt escape death and save me the trouble of inflicting it upon thee; if thou fightest and I vanquish thee, I demand no other satisfaction than that, laying aside arms and abstaining from going in quest of adventures, thou withdraw and betake thyself to thine own village for the space of a year, and live there without putting hand to sword, in peace and quiet and beneficial repose, the same being needful for the increase of thy substance and the salvation of thy soul; and if thou dost vanquish me, my head shall be at thy disposal, my arms and horse thy spoils, and the renown of my deeds transferred and added to thine. Consider which will be thy best course, and give me thy answer speedily, for this day is all the time I have for the despatch of this business.”\\n\\n Don Quixote was amazed and astonished, as well at the Knight of the White Moon’s arrogance, as at his reason for delivering the defiance, and with calm dignity he answered him, “Knight of the White Moon, of whose achievements I have never heard until now, I will venture to swear you have never seen the illustrious Dulcinea; for had you seen her I know you would have taken care not to venture yourself upon this issue, because the sight would have removed all doubt from your mind that there ever has been or can be a beauty to be compared with hers; and so, not saying you lie, but merely that you are not correct in what you state, I accept your challenge, with the conditions you have proposed, and at once, that the day you have fixed may not expire; and from your conditions I except only that of the renown of your achievements being transferred to me, for I know not of what sort they are nor what they may amount to; I am satisfied with my own, such as they be. Take, therefore, the side of the field you choose, and I will do the same; and to whom God shall give it may Saint Peter add his blessing.”\\n\\n The Knight of the White Moon had been seen from the city, and it was told the viceroy how he was in conversation with Don Quixote. The viceroy, fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by Don Antonio Moreno or some other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the beach accompanied by Don Antonio and several other gentlemen, just as Don Quixote was wheeling Rocinante round in order to take up the necessary distance. The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them were evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them, asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a sudden in this way. The Knight of the White Moon replied that it was a question of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had said to Don Quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sides had been accepted. The viceroy went over to Don Antonio, and asked in a low voice did he know who the Knight of the White Moon was, or was it some joke they were playing on Don Quixote. Don Antonio replied that he neither knew who he was nor whether the defiance was in joke or in earnest. This answer left the viceroy in a state of perplexity, not knowing whether he ought to let the combat go on or not; but unable to persuade himself that it was anything but a joke he fell back, saying, “If there be no other way out of it, gallant knights, except to confess or die, and Don Quixote is inflexible, and your worship of the White Moon still more so, in God’s hand be it, and fall on.”\\n\\n He of the White Moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosen words for the permission he gave them, and so did Don Quixote, who then, commending himself with all his heart to heaven and to his Dulcinea, as was his custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him, proceeded to take a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist was doing the same; then, without blast of trumpet or other warlike instrument to give them the signal to charge, both at the same instant wheeled their horses; and he of the White Moon, being the swifter, met Don Quixote after having traversed two-thirds of the course, and there encountered him with such violence that, without touching him with his lance (for he held it high, to all appearance purposely), he hurled Don Quixote and Rocinante to the earth, a perilous fall. He sprang upon him at once, and placing the lance over his visor said to him, “You are vanquished, sir knight, nay dead unless you admit the conditions of our defiance.”\\n\\n Don Quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his visor said in a weak feeble voice as if he were speaking out of a tomb, “Dulcinea del Toboso is the fairest woman in the world, and I the most unfortunate knight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by my feebleness; drive your lance home, sir knight, and take my life, since you have taken away my honour.”\\n\\n “That will I not, in sooth,” said he of the White Moon; “live the fame of the lady Dulcinea’s beauty undimmed as ever; all I require is that the great Don Quixote retire to his own home for a year, or for so long a time as shall by me be enjoined upon him, as we agreed before engaging in this combat.”\\n\\n The viceroy, Don Antonio, and several others who were present heard all this, and heard too how Don Quixote replied that so long as nothing in prejudice of Dulcinea was demanded of him, he would observe all the rest like a true and loyal knight. The engagement given, he of the White Moon wheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with a movement of the head, rode away into the city at a half gallop. The viceroy bade Don Antonio hasten after him, and by some means or other find out who he was. They raised Don Quixote up and uncovered his face, and found him pale and bathed with sweat.\\n\\n \\n\\n Rocinante from the mere hard measure he had received lay unable to stir for the present. Sancho, wholly dejected and woebegone, knew not what to say or do. He fancied that all was a dream, that the whole business was a piece of enchantment. Here was his master defeated, and bound not to take up arms for a year. He saw the light of the glory of his achievements obscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him swept away like smoke before the wind; Rocinante, he feared, was crippled for life, and his master’s bones out of joint; for if he were only shaken out of his madness it would be no small luck. In the end they carried him into the city in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and thither the viceroy himself returned, cager to ascertain who this Knight of the White Moon was who had left Don Quixote in such a sad plight.\\n\\n \\n\\n 安东尼奥·莫雷诺的夫人见安娜·费利克斯来到她家非常高兴，十分热情地接待了安娜·费利克斯。她不仅喜欢安娜·费利克斯的美貌，而且喜欢她的聪敏，在这两方面，安娜·费利克斯都可以说是出类拔萃。全城居民都跑出来看安娜·费利克斯。\\n\\n 唐吉诃德对安东尼奥说，他觉得大家商定的解救加斯帕尔的方法不妥，而且很危险，最好是让他全身披挂，带着他的马去柏培拉。即使全体摩尔人出动，他也能把加斯帕尔救出来，就像唐盖费罗斯那次救他夫人梅丽森德拉一样。\\n\\n “您别忘了，”桑乔说，“唐盖费罗斯是从陆地上把他妻子救出来，而且是通过陆地把妻子送到法国的。可我们即使把加斯帕尔救出来，中间隔着海，也无法把他送回西班牙。”\\n\\n “天无绝人之路，”唐吉诃德说，“只要船到岸边，我们肯定能上岸，多少人也拦不住。”\\n\\n “您说得倒轻巧，”桑乔说，“可是说来容易做到难。我还是主张让那个叛教者去。他是个好人，心肠也很好。”\\n\\n 安东尼奥说，如果叛教者没能把事情办好，他就请唐吉诃德出征柏培拉。\\n\\n 两天后，叛教者乘一条六对桨的小船出发了，船上配备了勇敢的划船手。又过了两天，那几艘大船也驶往东方。临行前，将军请求总督把营救格雷戈里奥的情况和安娜·费利克斯的状况告诉他，总督答应一定做到。\\n\\n 一天清晨，唐吉诃德全身披挂地在海滩上散步。就像他常说的，甲胄即服装，战斗即休息，所以他总是甲胄不离身。此时他忽然发现，前面有一个同样全副武装的骑士向他走来，骑士的盾牌上还画着一个亮晶晶的月亮。那人走到两人相互听得见的距离，便提高嗓门对唐吉诃德说道：\\n\\n “受到举世称赞的杰出骑士，曼查的唐吉诃德啊，我是白月骑士，我的英雄业绩也许你还记忆犹新。我特来向你挑战，试试你臂膀的力量，要你承认我的情人，别管她是谁，都显而易见地比托博索的杜尔西内亚漂亮。如果你痛痛快快地承认这个事实，我可以免你一死，我也就不用再劳神动手了。假如你同我比试，而且我战胜了你，我只要求你放下武器，并且不再征险，回到你的家乡一年内不许出来。在这期间，你不许舞刀弄剑，老老实实地过日子，这样才能增加你的财富，拯救你的灵魂。假如你打败了我，我的脑袋就交给你了，我的盔甲和马匹成为你的战利品，我的功名也都转让到你的名下。你看怎么办好吧，马上告诉我，我今天就要把这件事了结。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德对这位趾高气扬的白月骑士的挑战甚感意外和惊奇。他心平气和但又神态严肃地对白月骑士说道：“白月骑士，你的业绩我至今没听说过。我可以向你发誓，你从未见过尊贵的杜尔西内亚。如果你见过她，就不会向我提出这种要求了。你的亲眼所见就会让你明白，世界上没有也不可能有能与杜尔西内亚相比的美貌。所以，我不说你撒了谎，只说你讲得不对。你刚才提出的挑战条件我接受，而且，咱们马上就进行决斗吧，今天决定的事情就别拖到明天。不过，你提出的条件中有一条我不能接受，就是你要把你的功名让给我那条。我不知道你有什么业绩，而且我有自己的业绩就够了，且不管我的业绩如何。你任意选择你的位置站好吧，我也选择好我的位置，现在，就请上帝保佑，老天祝福吧。”\\n\\n 城里有人发现了白月骑士，马上报告了总督，说白月骑士正在同唐吉诃德说话。总督估计，肯定又是安东尼奥或者城里的其他某位绅士出的点子，便带着安东尼奥和其他绅士一起赶到了海滩。他们赶到时，唐吉诃德正掉转马的缰绳，准备站到自己的位置上去。总督见两个人眼看就要对冲过去，便站到了两人中间，问他们为什么忽然想起要进行这次决斗。\\n\\n 白月骑士说是为了决定两个女人究竟谁最漂亮，接着便介绍了他对唐吉诃德说的那些话，以及唐吉诃德接受了他的挑战条件等情况。总督走到了安东尼奥身旁，悄声问他是否知道白月骑士是什么人，这是不是同唐吉诃德开个玩笑。安东尼奥说，他也不知道这究竟是玩笑还是真的决斗。听安东尼奥这么一说，总督也拿不定主意这场决斗该不该进行了。不过，他估计是个玩笑，便退到一旁说道：\\n\\n “两位骑士大人，既然已经无法调和，就只能决一雌雄了。那好，让唐吉诃德在他的位置上准备好，白月骑士您也准备好，开始吧。”\\n\\n 白月骑士客客气气地感谢总督慷慨准许他们进行决斗，唐吉诃德也同样表示了谢意。唐吉诃德虔诚地祈求上帝和他的杜尔西内亚保佑他。唐吉诃德每次准备开始战斗时都这样。唐吉诃德见对手纵马跑开，准备把距离拉大一点儿，就自己也催马往远处跑了一点儿。没有号角或其他什么进攻的信号，两个人同时掉转了马头。白月骑士的马跑得比较快，所以，它跑了三分之二的距离才与唐吉诃德相遇。白月骑士并没有用长矛去碰唐吉诃德，好像故意把长矛抬高了一些，只是凭借巨大的惯性，把唐吉诃德连人带马撞倒在地上，而且撞得不轻。然后，白月骑士居高临下地用长矛指着唐吉诃德的护眼罩说道：\\n\\n “你输了，骑士，如果你不认可我提出的挑战条件，你就死定了。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德摔得浑身疼痛，头晕目眩。他并没有掀开护眼罩，声音就像是从坟墓里发出的一样，有气无力地说道：\\n\\n “托博索的杜尔西内亚是世界上最美丽的女人，我是世界上最倒霉的骑士。我不能因为自己的无能而抹杀这个事实。握紧你的长矛，骑士，杀死我吧，我已经名誉扫地了。”\\n\\n “我肯定不会杀死你，”白月骑士说，“托博索的杜尔西内亚夫人的美貌名声也不会受到损害。我只要你像咱们开始决斗前商定的那样，回到你的老家去，一年之内，除非我另有吩咐，不准再出来，这就够了。”\\n\\n 总督、安东尼奥和其他许多在场的人都听到了这些话。他们还听到唐吉诃德说，只要不损害杜尔西内亚，他作为一个说到做到的真正骑士，一切都可以执行。白月骑士听到唐吉诃德这几句话，便掉转马头，向总督点头致意，然后不慌不忙地向城里走去。\\n\\n 总督吩咐安东尼奥在后面跟着，以便弄清那个白月骑士到底是什么人。大家扶起唐吉诃德，为他卸下面具，只见他面无血色，大汗淋漓。罗西南多伤得不轻，当时已动弹不得。桑乔忧心忡忡，愁眉不展，不知该说什么做什么才好。这件事简直如一场恶梦，他觉得这一切都是魔法操纵的。他见主人已经认输，答应在一年之内不再动兵器，便联想到主人的英名已经黯淡，主人兑现新近答应的诺言的希望已经化为乌有。他担心罗西南多被摔坏了，担心主人骨头脱臼了。不过，如果因此把主人的疯病摔没了，那倒也算是一件幸事。后来，总督派人送来了轿子，大家把唐吉诃德抬到城里。总督也回到城里，急于打听那个把唐吉诃德打得一败涂地的白月骑士究竟是何许人也。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4685.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
