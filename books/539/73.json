{"id":42213,"no":73,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 19","content":"Don Quixote had gone but a short distance beyond Don Diego’s village, when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students, and a couple of peasants, mounted on four beasts of the ass kind. One of the students carried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of a portmanteau, what seemed to be a little linen and a couple of pairs of-ribbed stockings; the other carried nothing but a pair of new fencing-foils with buttons. The peasants carried divers articles that showed they were on their way from some large town where they had bought them, and were taking them home to their village; and both students and peasants were struck with the same amazement that everybody felt who saw Don Quixote for the first time, and were dying to know who this man, so different from ordinary men, could be. Don Quixote saluted them, and after ascertaining that their road was the same as his, made them an offer of his company, and begged them to slacken their pace, as their young asses travelled faster than his horse; and then, to gratify them, he told them in a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed, which was that of a knight-errant seeking adventures in all parts of the world. He informed them that his own name was Don Quixote of La Mancha, and that he was called, by way of surname, the Knight of the Lions.\n All this was Greek or gibberish to the peasants, but not so to the students, who very soon perceived the crack in Don Quixote’s pate; for all that, however, they regarded him with admiration and respect, and one of them said to him, “If you, sir knight, have no fixed road, as it is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any, let your worship come with us; you will see one of the finest and richest weddings that up to this day have ever been celebrated in La Mancha, or for many a league round.”\n Don Quixote asked him if it was some prince’s , that he spoke of it in this way. “Not at all,” said the student; “it is the wedding of a farmer and a farmer’s daughter, he the richest in all this country, and she the fairest mortal ever set eyes on. The display with which it is to be attended will be something rare and out of the common, for it will be celebrated in a meadow adjoining the town of the bride, who is called, par excellence, Quiteria the fair, as the bridegroom is called Camacho the rich. She is eighteen, and he twenty-two, and they are fairly matched, though some knowing ones, who have all the pedigrees in the world by heart, will have it that the family of the fair Quiteria is better than Camacho’s ; but no one minds that now-a-days, for wealth can solder a great many flaws. At any rate, Camacho is free-handed, and it is his fancy to screen the whole meadow with boughs and cover it in overhead, so that the sun will have hard work if he tries to get in to reach the grass that covers the soil. He has provided dancers too, not only sword but also bell-dancers, for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection; of shoe-dancers I say nothing, for of them he has engaged a host. But none of these things, nor of the many others I have omitted to mention, will do more to make this a memorable wedding than the part which I suspect the despairing Basilio will play in it. This Basilio is a youth of the same village as Quiteria, and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents, of which circumstance Love took advantage to reproduce to the word the long-forgotten loves of Pyramus and Thisbe; for Basilio loved Quiteria from his earliest years, and she responded to his passion with countless modest proofs of affection, so that the loves of the two children, Basilio and Quiteria, were the talk and the amusement of the town. As they grew up, the father of Quiteria made up his mind to refuse Basilio his wonted freedom of access to the house, and to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions, he arranged a match for his daughter with the rich Camacho, as he did not approve of marrying her to Basilio, who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature; for if the truth be told ungrudgingly, he is the most agile youth we know, a mighty thrower of the bar, a first-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; he runs like a deer, and leaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins as if by magic, sings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it speak, and, above all, handles a sword as well as the best.”\n “For that excellence alone,” said Don Quixote at this, “the youth deserves to marry, not merely the fair Quiteria, but Queen Guinevere herself, were she alive now, in spite of Launcelot and all who would try to prevent it.”\n “Say that to my wife,” said Sancho, who had until now listened in silence, “for she won’t hear of anything but each one marrying his equal, holding with the proverb ‘each ewe to her like.’ What I would like is that this good Basilio (for I am beginning to take a fancy to him already) should marry this lady Quiteria; and a blessing and good luck — I meant to say the opposite — on people who would prevent those who love one another from marrying.”\n “If all those who love one another were to marry,” said Don Quixote, “it would deprive parents of the right to choose, and marry their children to the proper person and at the proper time; and if it was left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be for choosing her father’s servant, and another, some one she has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing, though he may be a drunken bully; for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment, so much wanted in choosing one’s way of life; and the matrimonial choice is very liable to error, and it needs great caution and the special favour of heaven to make it a good one. He who has to make a long journey, will, if he is wise, look out for some trusty and pleasant companion to accompany him before he sets out. Why, then, should not he do the same who has to make the whole journey of life down to the final halting-place of death, more especially when the companion has to be his companion in bed, at board, and everywhere, as the wife is to her husband? The companionship of one’s wife is no article of merchandise, that, after it has been bought, may be returned, or bartered, or changed; for it is an inseparable accident that lasts as long as life lasts; it is a noose that, once you put it round your neck, turns into a Gordian knot, which, if the scythe of Death does not cut it, there is no untying. I could say a great deal more on this subject, were I not prevented by the anxiety I feel to know if the senor licentiate has anything more to tell about the story of Basilio.”\n To this the student, bachelor, or, as Don Quixote called him, licentiate, replied, “I have nothing whatever to say further, but that from the moment Basilio learned that the fair Quiteria was to be married to Camacho the rich, he has never been seen to smile, or heard to utter rational word, and he always goes about moody and dejected, talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses. He eats little and sleeps little, and all he eats is fruit, and when he sleeps, if he sleeps at all, it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute beast. Sometimes he gazes at the sky, at other times he fixes his eyes on the earth in such an abstracted way that he might be taken for a clothed statue, with its drapery stirred by the wind. In short, he shows such signs of a heart crushed by suffering, that all we who know him believe that when to-morrow the fair Quiteria says ‘yes,’ it will be his sentence of death.”\n “God will guide it better,” said Sancho, “for God who gives the wound gives the salve; nobody knows what will happen; there are a good many hours between this and to-morrow, and any one of them, or any moment, the house may fall; I have seen the rain coming down and the sun shining all at one time; many a one goes to bed in good health who can’t stir the next day. And tell me, is there anyone who can boast of having driven a nail into the wheel of fortune? No, faith; and between a woman’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’ I wouldn’t venture to put the point of a pin, for there would not be room for it; if you tell me Quiteria loves Basilio heart and soul, then I’ll give him a bag of good luck; for love, I have heard say, looks through spectacles that make copper seem gold, poverty wealth, and blear eyes pearls.”\n “What art thou driving at, Sancho? curses on thee!” said Don Quixote; “for when thou takest to stringing proverbs and sayings together, no one can understand thee but Judas himself, and I wish he had thee. Tell me, thou animal, what dost thou know about nails or wheels, or anything else?”\n “Oh, if you don’t understand me,” replied Sancho, “it is no wonder my words are taken for nonsense; but no matter; I understand myself, and I know I have not said anything very foolish in what I have said; only your worship, senor, is always gravelling at everything I say, nay, everything I do.”\n “Cavilling, not gravelling,” said Don Quixote, “thou prevaricator of honest language, God confound thee!”\n “Don’t find fault with me, your worship,” returned Sancho, “for you know I have not been bred up at court or trained at Salamanca, to know whether I am adding or dropping a letter or so in my words. Why! God bless me, it’s not fair to force a Sayago-man to speak like a Toledan; maybe there are Toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to polished talk.”\n “That is true,” said the licentiate, “for those who have been bred up in the Tanneries and the Zocodover cannot talk like those who are almost all day pacing the cathedral cloisters, and yet they are all Toledans. Pure, correct, elegant and lucid language will be met with in men of courtly breeding and discrimination, though they may have been born in Majalahonda; I say of discrimination, because there are many who are not so, and discrimination is the grammar of good language, if it be accompanied by practice. I, sirs, for my sins have studied canon law at Salamanca, and I rather pique myself on expressing my meaning in clear, plain, and intelligible language.”\n “If you did not pique yourself more on your dexterity with those foils you carry than on dexterity of tongue,” said the other student, “you would have been head of the degrees, where you are now tail.”\n “Look here, bachelor Corchuelo,” returned the licentiate, “you have the most mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword, if you think it useless.”\n “It is no idea on my part, but an established truth,” replied Corchuelo; “and if you wish me to prove it to you by experiment, you have swords there, and it is a good opportunity; I have a steady hand and a strong arm, and these joined with my resolution, which is not small, will make you confess that I am not mistaken. Dismount and put in practice your positions and circles and angles and science, for I hope to make you see stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship, in which, next to God, I place my trust that the man is yet to be born who will make me turn my back, and that there is not one in the world I will not compel to give ground.”\n “As to whether you turn your back or not, I do not concern myself,” replied the master of fence; “though it might be that your grave would be dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time; I mean that you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword.”\n “We shall soon see,” replied Corchuelo, and getting off his ass briskly, he drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiate carried on his beast.\n “It must not be that way,” said Don Quixote at this point; “I will be the director of this fencing match, and judge of this often disputed question;” and dismounting from Rocinante and grasping his lance, he planted himself in the middle of the road, just as the licentiate, with an easy, graceful bearing and step, advanced towards Corchuelo, who came on against him, darting fire from his eyes, as the saying is. The other two of the company, the peasants, without dismounting from their asses, served as spectators of the mortal tragedy. The cuts, thrusts, down strokes, back strokes and doubles, that Corchuelo delivered were past counting, and came thicker than hops or hail. He attacked like an angry lion, but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the licentiate’s sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset, and made him kiss it as if it were a relic, though not as devoutly as relics are and ought to he kissed. The end of it was that the licentiate reckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons of the short cassock he wore, tore the skirts into strips, like the tails of a cuttlefish, knocked off his hat twice, and so completely tired him out, that in vexation, anger, and rage, he took the sword by the hilt and flung it away with such force, that one of the peasants that were there, who was a notary, and who went for it, made an affidavit afterwards that he sent it nearly three-quarters of a league, which testimony will serve, and has served, to show and establish with all certainty that strength is overcome by skill.\n Corchuelo sat down wearied, and Sancho approaching him said, “By my faith, senor bachelor, if your worship takes my advice, you will never challenge anyone to fence again, only to wrestle and throw the bar, for you have the youth and strength for that; but as for these fencers as they call them, I have heard say they can put the point of a sword through the eye of a needle.”\n “I am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey,” said Corchuelo, “and with having had the truth I was so ignorant of proved to me by experience;” and getting up he embraced the licentiate, and they were better friends than ever; and not caring to wait for the notary who had gone for the sword, as they saw he would be a long time about it, they resolved to push on so as to reach the village of Quiteria, to which they all belonged, in good time.\n During the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them on the excellences of the sword, with such conclusive arguments, and such figures and mathematical proofs, that all were convinced of the value of the science, and Corchuelo cured of his dogmatism.\n It grew dark; but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as if there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it. They heard, too, the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments, flutes, drums, psalteries, pipes, tabors, and timbrels, and as they drew near they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcade that had been constructed at the entrance of the town were filled with lights unaffected by the wind, for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees. The musicians were the life of the wedding, wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate bands, some dancing, others singing, others playing the various instruments already mentioned. In short, it seemed as though mirth and gaiety were frisking and gambolling all over the meadow. Several other persons were engaged in erecting raised benches from which people might conveniently see the plays and dances that were to be performed the next day on the spot dedicated to the celebration of the marriage of Camacho the rich and the obsequies of Basilio. Don Quixote would not enter the village, although the peasant as well as the bachelor pressed him; he excused himself, however, on the grounds, amply sufficient in his opinion, that it was the custom of knights-errant to sleep in the fields and woods in preference to towns, even were it under gilded ceilings; and so turned aside a little out of the road, very much against Sancho’s will, as the good quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of Don Diego came back to his mind.\n \n 唐吉诃德离开迭戈家后走了不远，就碰到两个教士模样或者学生模样的人，还有两个农夫，四个人都骑着驴。一个学生带着一个绿色粗布包，当旅行包用，里面隐约露出一点白色细呢料和两双粗线袜。另一个学生只带着两把击剑用的新剑，剑上套着剑套。农夫带着其他一些东西。看样子他们是刚从某个大镇采购回来，要把东西送回村里去。学生和农夫同其他初见唐吉诃德的人一样感到惊奇，很想知道这个与众不同的怪人到底是谁。唐吉诃德向他们问好，得知他们与自己同路，便表示愿与他们为伴，请他们放慢一点，因为他们的驴比自己的马走得快。唐吉诃德还简单地向他们介绍了自己是什么人以及自己从事的行当，说自己是个游历四方、寻奇征险的游侠骑士，并且告诉他们，自己叫曼查的唐吉诃德，别名狮子骑士。唐吉诃德这番话对于农夫来说简直是天书，可两个学生却能听懂，他们马上意识到唐吉诃德的头脑有毛病，深感意外，但是出于礼貌，其中一人对唐吉诃德说道：\n “骑士大人，假如您的行程路线不是一成不变的，因为寻奇征险的人常常如此，那么您就同我们一起走吧，这样您就会看到曼查乃至周围很多里之内迄今为止最盛大、最豪华的一次婚礼。”\n 唐吉诃德问他是哪位王子的婚礼，竟如此了不起。\n “是一个农夫和一个农妇的婚礼。”学生说道，“农夫是当地的首富，农妇则是男人们见过的最漂亮的女子。婚礼的场面极其新颖别致，因为婚礼将在新娘家所在村庄旁边的一块草地上举行。新娘美貌超群，被称为美女基特里亚，新郎则叫富豪卡马乔。新娘芳龄十八，新郎年方二十二，可谓天生一对，地配一双，虽然有些人好管闲事，总念叨两家的门第不合，因为美女基特里亚家的门第比卡马乔家高。不过，现在已经不太注重这个了，财富完全可以弥补这个裂痕。这个卡马乔很潇洒，忽然心血来潮地要给整片草地搭上树枝，让阳光照不到那覆盖着地面的绿草。他还准备了舞蹈表演，有剑舞和小铃铛舞，村里有的人简直把这两种舞跳绝了；还有踢踏舞，那就更不用说了，请了很多人来跳呢。不过，我刚才说到的这些事，以及其他我没有说到的事，也许都不是这场婚礼上令人最难忘的。我估计最难忘的大概是那个绝望的巴西利奥将在婚礼上的所作所为。巴西利奥是基特里亚邻居家的一个小伙子，他家与基特里亚父母家住隔壁。爱神要利用这个机会向世人重演那个已经被遗忘的皮拉摩斯和提斯柏的爱情故事。巴西利奥从很小的年龄就爱上了基特里亚，基特里亚对他则以礼回报。村里的人在闲谈时就说这两个孩子谈情说爱了。随着两人年龄的增长，基特里亚的父亲不让巴西利奥像以前一样随便到他家去了。为了免得总是放心不下，他让女儿同富豪卡马乔结婚。他觉得把女儿嫁给巴西利奥不合适，巴西利奥的经济条件和家庭境况都不那么好。不过说实话，他是我们所知道的最聪明的小伙子。他掷棒是能手，角斗水平很高，玩球也玩得很好；他跑如雄鹿，跳似山羊，玩滚球游戏简直玩神了；他有百灵鸟一样的歌喉，弹起吉他来如歌如诉，特别是斗起剑来最灵敏。”\n “单凭这点，”唐吉诃德这时说，“别说和美女基特里亚结婚，就是同希内夫拉女王结婚，他也完全配得上，假设女王今天还活着的话！兰萨罗特和其他任何人企图阻止都无济于事。”\n “你们听听我老婆是怎么说的吧，”桑乔刚才一直在旁边默默地听，这时候突然说道，“她历来主张门当户对，就像俗话说的，‘物以类聚，人以群分’。我觉得巴西利奥这个小伙子不错，应该同那个美女基特里亚结婚。谁要想阻止有情人成为眷属，就让他今世长乐，来世长安①！”\n ①桑乔在此处把意思说反了。\n “如果有情人就可以结婚，”唐吉诃德说，“那么儿女和谁结婚，以及什么时候结婚，就由不得父母选择和做主了。如果做女儿的可以自主选择丈夫，她很可能会选中父亲的佣人，也可能在大街上见到某个人英俊潇洒，就看上那个人了，尽管那个人其实是好斗的无赖。恋爱很容易蒙住理智的双眼，而理智对于选择配偶是必不可少的。选择配偶很容易失误，必须小心翼翼，还要有老天的特别关照才行。一个人要出远门，如果他是个谨慎的人，就会在上路之前寻找一个可靠的伙伴同行。既然如此，为什么一个人在选择将与自己共同走完生命路程的伴侣时不能这样呢？况且，妻子和丈夫要同床共枕，同桌共餐，做什么事情都在一起呢。妻子不是商品，买了以后还可以退换。这是一件不能分割的事情，生命延续多长，它就有多长。这种联系一旦套到了脖子上，就成了死结，除了死神的斩刀，任何东西都不可能把它解开。关于这个题目，还有很多可以谈的。不过我现在很想知道，关于巴西利奥的事，学士大人是否还有什么可以告诉我的？”\n 那个被唐吉诃德称为学士的学生答道：\n “也没有太多可说的了，只知道巴西利奥自从听说美女基特里亚要同卡马乔结婚，就再也没笑过，也没说过一句像样的话，总是若有所思，闷闷不乐地自言自语，神志很明显已经不正常了。他吃得少，睡得也少，而且吃的时候只吃水果，睡的时候就像个野兽似的睡在野外的硬土地上。他不时仰望天空，又不时呆痴地盯着地面，除了空气吹动他的衣服之外，他简直就是一尊雕像。他显然已经伤透了心。我们所有认识他的人都认为，明天美女基特里亚的一声‘愿意’就等于宣判了他的死亡。”\n “上帝会有更好的安排，”桑乔说，“上帝给他造成了创伤，也会给他治伤；从现在到明天还有很多小时呢，谁知道会发生什么事情？说不定什么时候房子就塌了呢。我就见过一边下雨一边出太阳的情况，说不定谁晚上躺下时还好好的，第二天早晨就起不来了呢。你们说，有谁敢夸口自己总能平步青云呢？没有，肯定没有。女人的‘愿意’和‘不愿意’几乎没什么区别。我觉得基特里亚真心实意地爱着巴西利奥，我祝巴西利奥洪福齐天。我听说，爱情会给人戴上有色眼镜，让人把铜看成是金子，把穷看成富，把眼屎看成珍珠。”\n “你还有完没完了，可恶的桑乔？”唐吉诃德说，“你只要说起话来就怪话连篇，非得让魔鬼把你带走才成。你说，你这个畜生，什么‘平步青云’，还有其他那些话，你都懂吗？”\n “如果没有人明白我说的是什么意思，”桑乔说，“那么把我的话都看成胡说八道，也没什么奇怪。不过这也没关系，反正我自己知道，我刚才说的绝非胡说八道，倒是您，我的大人，总是对我所说所做百般地‘挑赐’。”\n “应该说‘挑剔’，”唐吉诃德说，“不是‘挑赐’，挺好的话让你一说就走了样，真不知是谁把你搞得这么糊里糊涂的。”\n “您别跟我生气，”桑乔说，“您知道我不是在京城长大的，也没有在萨拉曼卡上过学，所以不知什么时候，我说话就会多个字或少个字。真得靠上帝保佑了。其实，没有必要让一个萨亚戈人说话同托莱多人一样标准，而且，也不见得所有托莱多人说话都那么利索。”\n “的确如此，”学士说，“同在托莱多，在制革厂和菜市等地区长大的人，就同整天在教堂回廊里闲荡的人说话不一样。纯正、地道、优雅和明确的语言应该由言语严谨的朝臣来说，即使他们出生在马哈拉翁达。我说‘言语严谨’是因为他们当中很多人言语并非严谨，而严谨的言语应当是了解一种优秀语言的语法，再伴之以正确的运用。各位大人，恕我冒昧，我是在萨拉曼卡学习宗教法规的，自认为可以明白、通顺而且言之有意地表达我的思想。”\n 另一个学生说：“你不是认为你耍黑剑①的本事比耍嘴皮子的本事还大吗？不然的话，你在学习上就应该排第一，而不是排末尾了。”\n ①黑剑指铁剑，白剑指钢剑。\n “喂，你这个多嘴的家伙，”学士说道，“你对击剑的技巧一无所知，所以对它的认识也就大错而特错了。”\n “对于我来说，这并不是什么认识问题，而是切切实实的事实。”那个名叫科丘埃洛的学生说，“如果你想找我领教一下的话，就拿剑来，正好我现在来劲儿呢，而且精神头儿也不小，肯定会让你明白我并没说错。你下来，使出你的步伐、弧圈、角度和理论来吧，我就用我的外行蛮技术，准能把你打得眼冒金星。除了上帝，恐怕还没有谁能让我败阵呢，相反倒是一个个都被我打跑了。”\n “你败阵没败阵我管不着，”另一个也不示弱，“反正你上场立脚之处很可能就是为你掘墓的地方。我是说，你会死在你的技术上。”\n “那就看分晓吧。”科丘埃洛说。\n 说着他立刻从驴背上跳下来，怒气冲冲地从学士的驴背上抄起了一把剑。\n “别这么简单，”唐吉诃德这时说，“我愿意做你们的击剑教练和裁判，否则就可能说不清了。”\n 唐吉诃德说着跳下马来，抓起他的长矛，站在路中央。此时，学士已经英姿勃勃、步伐有序地冲向科丘埃洛。科丘埃洛也向他刺来，而且眼睛里就像人们常说的那样，冒着火。两个与他们同行的农民则在驴背上观赏这场恶战。科丘埃洛又挥又刺又劈，反手抡，双手砍，重有重力，轻有轻功，频频出击。他像一头暴怒的狮子不断进攻着，可是，学士的剑套忽然迎面飞来，糊到他嘴上，把他的锐气戛然斩断，让他像吻圣物一般吻了那只剑套，虽然并不像吻圣物那样虔诚。最后，学士一剑一剑地把科丘埃洛衣服上的扣子全剥了下来，把他的衣服划成一条一条的，像是章鱼的尾巴，还把他的帽子打掉了两次，弄得他狼狈不堪，气得他抓住剑柄，用尽全身力气扔了出去。在场的一位农夫曾经当过公证员。据他事后证明，那剑扔出了差不多一里地。由此说明，人们完全可以用智巧战胜蛮力。\n 科丘埃洛筋疲力尽地坐了下来。桑乔走到他身旁，对他说道：\n “依我看，大学生，您就听听我的劝告，从此以后再也不要向任何人挑战比剑了，最多只能比比摔跤或掷棒，因为您既年轻，又有力气。至于那些击剑高手，我听说他们能准确地把剑尖刺进针鼻儿里去呢。”\n “我很高兴我能认识到我错了，”科丘埃洛说，“经过亲身经历我才明白，我与事实相距甚远。”\n 科丘埃洛说着站了起来，拥抱了学士，两人和好如初。这时公证员去捡剑。他们估计他还要一段时间才能回来，就决定不等他了，争取尽早赶到基特里亚那个村庄去，他们都是那个村庄的人。\n 在后面这段路程里，学士向大家介绍了一些剑术的技巧，讲得既生动又有条理，大家都意识到了技巧的重要性，科丘埃洛也消除了自己的偏见。\n 已是傍晚了。他们还没到达村子，就觉得前面的村子里仿佛有无数星光在闪烁，同时还听到了笛子、小鼓、古琴、双管笛、手鼓、铃鼓等各种乐器混合在一起的轻柔乐曲。走近村子，他们才发现村子入口处已经用树枝搭起了一个棚子，上面装满了彩灯。当时的风非常微弱，连树叶都不摆动，所以彩灯也都静止不动。\n 那些吹奏乐曲的人都是来庆贺婚礼的。他们三三两两地来回走动，有的唱，有的跳，还有一部分人演奏着上面说的各种乐器。草地上到处洋溢着欢乐的气氛。更多的人则在忙着搭看台，准备第二天进行歌舞表演，正式举行富豪卡马乔的婚礼和巴西利奥的葬礼。尽管农夫和学生盛情邀请，唐吉诃德却不肯进村。他请求农夫和学生原谅，说他始终认为游侠骑士应当住在野外树林里，而不是留宿在村镇里，哪怕是金屋玉宇也不行。说完唐吉诃德就离开了大路。桑乔对此极为不满，此时他又想起了迭戈家的舒适的住宿条件。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4640.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
