{"id":42251,"no":111,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 57","content":"Don Quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he was leading in the castle; for he fancied that he was making himself sorely missed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid the countless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as a knight, and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to heaven of that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked the duke and duchess to grant him permission to take his departure. They gave it, showing at the same time that they were very sorry he was leaving them. The duchess gave his wife’s letters to Sancho Panza, who shed tears over them, saying, “Who would have thought that such grand hopes as the news of my government bred in my wife Teresa Panza’s breast would end in my going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master Don Quixote of La Mancha? Still I’m glad to see my Teresa behaved as she ought in sending the acorns, for if she had not sent them I’d have been sorry, and she’d have shown herself ungrateful. It is a comfort to me that they can’t call that present a bribe; for I had got the government already when she sent them, and it’s but reasonable that those who have had a good turn done them should show their gratitude, if it’s only with a trifle. After all I went into the government naked, and I come out of it naked; so I can say with a safe conscience — and that’s no small matter — ‘naked I was born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain.’” Thus did Sancho soliloquise on the day of their departure, as Don Quixote, who had the night before taken leave of the duke and duchess, coming out made his appearance at an early hour in full armour in the courtyard of the castle. The whole household of the castle were watching him from the corridors, and the duke and duchess, too, came out to see him. Sancho was mounted on his Dapple, with his alforjas, valise, and proven. supremely happy because the duke’s majordomo, the same that had acted the part of the Trifaldi, had given him a little purse with two hundred gold crowns to meet the necessary expenses of the road, but of this Don Quixote knew nothing as yet. While all were, as has been said, observing him, suddenly from among the duennas and handmaidens the impudent and witty Altisidora lifted up her voice and said in pathetic tones: Give ear, cruel knight; Draw rein; where’s the need Of spurring the flanks Of that ill-broken steed? From what art thou flying? No dragon I am, Not even a sheep, But a tender young lamb. Thou hast jilted a maiden As fair to behold As nymph of Diana Or Venus of old. Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee? Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee! In thy claws, ruthless robber, Thou bearest away The heart of a meek Loving maid for thy prey, Three kerchiefs thou stealest, And garters a pair, From legs than the whitest Of marble more fair; And the sighs that pursue thee Would burn to the ground Two thousand Troy Towns, If so many were found. Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee? Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee! May no bowels of mercy To Sancho be granted, And thy Dulcinea Be left still enchanted, May thy falsehood to me Find its punishment in her, For in my land the just Often pays for the sinner. May thy grandest adventures Discomfitures prove, May thy joys be all dreams, And forgotten thy love. Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee? Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee! May thy name be abhorred For thy conduct to ladies, From London to England, From Seville to Cadiz; May thy cards be unlucky, Thy hands contain ne’er a King, seven, or ace When thou playest primera; When thy corns are cut May it be to the quick; When thy grinders are drawn May the roots of them stick. Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee? Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee! All the while the unhappy Altisidora was bewailing herself in the above strain Don Quixote stood staring at her; and without uttering a word in reply to her he turned round to Sancho and said, “Sancho my friend, I conjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth; say, hast thou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters this love-sick maid speaks of?” To this Sancho made answer, “The three kerchiefs I have; but the garters, as much as ‘over the hills of Ubeda.’” The duchess was amazed at Altisidora’s assurance; she knew that she was bold, lively, and impudent, but not so much so as to venture to make free in this fashion; and not being prepared for the joke, her astonishment was all the greater. The duke had a mind to keep up the sport, so he said, “It does not seem to me well done in you, sir knight, that after having received the hospitality that has been offered you in this very castle, you should have ventured to carry off even three kerchiefs, not to say my handmaid’s garters. It shows a bad heart and does not tally with your reputation. Restore her garters, or else I defy you to mortal combat, for I am not afraid of rascally enchanters changing or altering my features as they changed his who encountered you into those of my lacquey, Tosilos.” “God forbid,” said Don Quixote, “that I should draw my sword against your illustrious person from which I have received such great favours. The kerchiefs I will restore, as Sancho says he has them; as to the garters that is impossible, for I have not got them, neither has he; and if your handmaiden here will look in her hiding-places, depend upon it she will find them. I have never been a thief, my lord duke, nor do I mean to be so long as I live, if God cease not to have me in his keeping. This damsel by her own confession speaks as one in love, for which I am not to blame, and therefore need not ask pardon, either of her or of your excellence, whom I entreat to have a better opinion of me, and once more to give me leave to pursue my journey.” “And may God so prosper it, Senor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, “that we may always hear good news of your exploits; God speed you; for the longer you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of the damsels who behold you; and as for this one of mine, I will so chastise her that she will not transgress again, either with her eyes or with her words.” “One word and no more, O valiant Don Quixote, I ask you to hear,” said Altisidora, “and that is that I beg your pardon about the theft of the garters; for by God and upon my soul I have got them on, and I have fallen into the same blunder as he did who went looking for his ass being all the while mounted on it.” “Didn’t I say so?” said Sancho. “I’m a likely one to hide thefts! Why if I wanted to deal in them, opportunities came ready enough to me in my government.” Don Quixote bowed his head, and saluted the duke and duchess and all the bystanders, and wheeling Rocinante round, Sancho following him on Dapple, he rode out of the castle, shaping his course for Saragossa. 侍女阿尔蒂西多拉同唐吉诃德的纠葛 唐吉诃德觉得自己应该摆脱城堡里这种安逸的生活了。他觉得让自己无所事事地留在这里，让公爵和公爵夫人像对待所有游侠骑士那样，每天都沉溺在歌舞升平之中，实在有负于上帝。于是有一天，他请求公爵和公爵夫人准许自己离开。公爵和公爵夫人表现出很依依不舍的样子，同意了唐吉诃德的请求。公爵夫人把桑乔的妻子给丈夫的信交给了桑乔。 桑乔看完信，不禁泪流满面，说道： “我老婆特雷莎听说我当了总督，对我寄托了如此大的希望，哪里会想到到头来，我还得跟着主人唐吉诃德四处漂泊呢？但即使这样，我还是很高兴我的特雷莎不忘本分，给公爵夫人送来了橡子，否则她就显得忘恩负义了，那么我会很伤心的。令我宽慰的是，这礼物不能算贿赂，因为在她送橡子之前，我已经当上了总督。如果得到了别人的好处，哪怕只送一点儿小小的礼物，也算是知恩图报了。实际上，我当总督来去都是赤条条，因此我可以心安理得地说：‘我生来赤条条，现在也是赤条条，没亏也没赚。’这就不错了。” 这是桑乔出发那天发生的事。唐吉诃德在前一天晚上已经向公爵和公爵夫人告别，现在他全身披挂地出现在城堡的空场上。城堡里的所有人都已聚集在走廊里看着唐吉诃德，公爵和公爵夫人也来了。桑乔带着褡裢、提包和干粮，骑在驴背上，非常高兴，因为前一天晚上，公爵的管家，也就是那个扮成三摆裙夫人的人，给了他一个小口袋，里面有两百个金盾，以备路上用。这件事连唐吉诃德也不知道。大家正为唐吉诃德送行，女佣群里那个机灵淘气的阿尔蒂西多拉忽然提高了嗓门，语调凄凉地说道： 坏骑士，请你勒一下缰绳， 听我讲， 不必催动你那不驯的马匹 把蹄扬。 虚伪的人，你逃避的 不是一条毒蛇， 而是一只 小小的羔羊。 恶毒的魔鬼，你嘲弄的 是山上的狄安娜和树林里的维纳斯 都相形见绌的 美丽姑娘。 冷酷的比雷诺①，逃亡的埃涅阿斯②， 让恶魔与你为伴，我心才舒畅。 你用你的爪子 无情地带走了 一个多情温柔姑娘的 肝胆心肠。 你还带走了三块头巾， 一副吊袜带， 就从我那 洁白似玉的细嫩腿上。 你还带走了我的无数叹息， 倘若它们能变成火焰， 即使有无数的特洛伊， 也会被烧光。 冷酷的比雷诺，逃亡的埃涅阿斯， 让恶魔与你为伴，我心才舒畅。 你的侍从桑乔 冷漠无情， 却使你的杜尔西内亚摆脱不了魔障。 也许在我这里， 好人为罪人受过。 你是自作自受， 重罚应当。 你的最佳运气 终将变成不幸， 你的遐思只能变成梦想， 你的忠贞必将被人遗忘。 冷酷的比雷诺，逃亡的埃涅阿斯， 让恶魔与你为伴，我心才舒畅。 从塞维利亚到马切纳， 从格拉纳达到洛哈， 从伦敦到英国③ 让你的伪君子臭名远扬。 如果你玩 “王朝”、“百分”或“头牌”④， 大小王不到你手， 七和A也无望。 你若修趼子， 让你血流不止； 你若拔牙， 让你牙根断在牙床！ 冷酷的比雷诺，逃亡的埃涅阿斯， 让恶魔与你为伴，我心才舒畅。 ①比雷诺是阿里奥斯托的《疯狂的奥兰多》中的人物，曾将其情人抛弃于荒岛上。 ②埃涅阿斯抛弃了他的情人迦太基女王，逃到意大利，参见《埃涅阿斯纪》。 ③马切纳位于塞维利亚境内，洛哈位于格拉纳达境内，伦敦是英国首都。此处均为戏谑语。 ④三种牌戏名。在这三种打法中，大小王、七和A分别是最大的。 心受创伤的阿尔蒂西多拉哀叹着自己的命运，唐吉诃德一直注视着她，一言不发。阿尔蒂西多拉唱完后，唐吉诃德转过头对桑乔说道： “我以你家先辈的性命发誓，我的桑乔，你必须对我说实话，是不是你拿了这位多情姑娘说的那三块头巾和一副吊袜带？” 桑乔答道： “三块头巾是我拿的，可那副吊袜带，跟我根本就不沾边。” 公爵夫人对阿尔蒂西多拉的大胆行为甚感惊讶。她虽然知道阿尔蒂西多拉冒失、爱开玩笑并且放肆，却没料到这个姑娘会放肆到这种程度。而且，她事先并不知道阿尔蒂西多拉会开这个玩笑，所以更是惊奇不已。公爵想把气氛搞得更活跃些，便说道： “骑士大人，您在我的城堡里受到了很好的款待，却居然偷走我的侍女的至少三块头巾，也许还有一副吊袜带，我觉得这样不好。这表明您居心不良，与您的盛名不符。请您把吊袜带还给这位姑娘，否则我就要同您展开一场生死决斗，而且决不惧怕恶毒的魔法师像对待与您交战的仆人托西洛斯那样，改变我的面孔。” “上帝并不希望我向曾经热情照顾我的大人拔剑。”唐吉诃德说，“头巾我可以还回去，桑乔说在他手里呢。可是还吊袜带就不可能了，因为我和桑乔都没拿。如果您这位女佣仔细翻翻自己的东西，准能找到。公爵大人，我从没有偷过东西，今生今世也不想偷，上帝也不允许我这样做。至于这位姑娘已经坠入情网而不能自拔，我没有责任，因此也就没有必要向您和向她道歉。我只请求您不要把人看扁了，还是重新让我上路吧。” “愿上帝保佑您一路平安，唐吉诃德大人。”公爵夫人说，“愿我们总能听到您的好消息。再见吧。只要您还留在这里，所有看到您的姑娘就都会欲火难捺。我这个侍女我自会责罚，让她以后心正眼不斜。” “请您再听我说一句，英勇的唐吉诃德。”阿尔蒂西多拉说道，“请您原谅我说您拿了我的吊袜带。我向上帝和我的灵魂发誓，吊袜带现在就在我腿上呢。我真是骑驴找驴。” “我早就说过，”桑乔说，“若是我拿了东西不说，那像话吗？如果我想拿，我当总督的时候有的是机会。” 唐吉诃德向公爵、公爵夫人和所有在场的人低头鞠躬，然后掉转缰绳走出了城堡。桑乔骑着驴跟在后面，两人直奔萨拉戈萨。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4678.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
