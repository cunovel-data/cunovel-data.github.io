{"id":42263,"no":123,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 69","content":"The horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot, without a moment’s delay taking up Sancho and Don Quixote bodily, they carried them into the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed in sockets were burning, besides above five hundred lamps in the corridors, so that in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the want of daylight could not be perceived. In the middle of the court was a catafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and covered completely by an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all round it white wax tapers burned in more than a hundred silver candlesticks. Upon the catafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel so lovely that by her beauty she made death itself look beautiful. She lay with her head resting upon a cushion of brocade and crowned with a garland of sweet-smelling flowers of divers sorts, her hands crossed upon her bosom, and between them a branch of yellow palm of victory. On one side of the court was erected a stage, where upon two chairs were seated two persons who from having crowns on their heads and sceptres in their hands appeared to be kings of some sort, whether real or mock ones. By the side of this stage, which was reached by steps, were two other chairs on which the men carrying the prisoners seated Don Quixote and Sancho, all in silence, and by signs giving them to understand that they too were to he silent; which, however, they would have been without any signs, for their amazement at all they saw held them tongue-tied. And now two persons of distinction, who were at once recognised by Don Quixote as his hosts the duke and duchess, ascended the stage attended by a numerous suite, and seated themselves on two gorgeous chairs close to the two kings, as they seemed to be. Who would not have been amazed at this? Nor was this all, for Don Quixote had perceived that the dead body on the catafalque was that of the fair Altisidora. As the duke and duchess mounted the stage Don Quixote and Sancho rose and made them a profound obeisance, which they returned by bowing their heads slightly. At this moment an official crossed over, and approaching Sancho threw over him a robe of black buckram painted all over with flames of fire, and taking off his cap put upon his head a mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the Holy Office wear; and whispered in his ear that he must not open his lips, or they would put a gag upon him, or take his life. Sancho surveyed himself from head to foot and saw himself all ablaze with flames; but as they did not burn him, he did not care two farthings for them. He took off the mitre and seeing painted with devils he put it on again, saying to himself, “Well, so far those don’t burn me nor do these carry me off.” Don Quixote surveyed him too, and though fear had got the better of his faculties, he could not help smiling to see the figure Sancho presented. And now from underneath the catafalque, so it seemed, there rose a low sweet sound of flutes, which, coming unbroken by human voice (for there silence itself kept silence), had a soft and languishing effect. Then, beside the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body, suddenly appeared a fair youth in a Roman habit, who, to the accompaniment of a harp which he himself played, sang in a sweet and clear voice these two stanzas:\\n\\n While fair Altisidora, who the sport\\n\\n Of cold Don Quixote’s cruelty hath been,\\n\\n Returns to life, and in this magic court\\n\\n The dames in sables come to grace the scene,\\n\\n And while her matrons all in seemly sort\\n\\n My lady robes in baize and bombazine,\\n\\n Her beauty and her sorrows will I sing\\n\\n With defter quill than touched the Thracian string.\\n\\n But not in life alone, methinks, to me\\n\\n Belongs the office; Lady, when my tongue\\n\\n Is cold in death, believe me, unto thee\\n\\n My voice shall raise its tributary song.\\n\\n My soul, from this strait prison-house set free,\\n\\n As o’er the Stygian lake it floats along,\\n\\n Thy praises singing still shall hold its way,\\n\\n And make the waters of oblivion stay.\\n\\n At this point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed, “Enough, enough, divine singer! It would be an endless task to put before us now the death and the charms of the peerless Altisidora, not dead as the ignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in the penance which Sancho Panza, here present, has to undergo to restore her to the long-lost light. Do thou, therefore, O Rhadamanthus, who sittest in judgment with me in the murky caverns of Dis, as thou knowest all that the inscrutable fates have decreed touching the resuscitation of this damsel, announce and declare it at once, that the happiness we look forward to from her restoration be no longer deferred.”\\n\\n No sooner had Minos the fellow judge of Rhadamanthus said this, than Rhadamanthus rising up said:\\n\\n “Ho, officials of this house, high and low, great and small, make haste hither one and all, and print on Sancho’s face four-and-twenty smacks, and give him twelve pinches and six pin thrusts in the back and arms; for upon this ceremony depends the restoration of Altisidora.”\\n\\n On hearing this Sancho broke silence and cried out, “By all that’s good, I’ll as soon let my face be smacked or handled as turn Moor. Body o’ me! What has handling my face got to do with the resurrection of this damsel? ‘The old woman took kindly to the blits; they enchant Dulcinea, and whip me in order to disenchant her; Altisidora dies of ailments God was pleased to send her, and to bring her to life again they must give me four-and-twenty smacks, and prick holes in my body with pins, and raise weals on my arms with pinches! Try those jokes on a brother-in-law; ‘I’m an old dog, and “tus, tus” is no use with me.’”\\n\\n “Thou shalt die,” said Rhadamanthus in a loud voice; “relent, thou tiger; humble thyself, proud Nimrod; suffer and he silent, for no impossibilities are asked of thee; it is not for thee to inquire into the difficulties in this matter; smacked thou must be, pricked thou shalt see thyself, and with pinches thou must be made to howl. Ho, I say, officials, obey my orders; or by the word of an honest man, ye shall see what ye were born for.”\\n\\n At this some six duennas, advancing across the court, made their appearance in procession, one after the other, four of them with spectacles, and all with their right hands uplifted, showing four fingers of wrist to make their hands look longer, as is the fashion now-a-days. No sooner had Sancho caught sight of them than, bellowing like a bull, he exclaimed, “I might let myself be handled by all the world; but allow duennas to touch me — not a bit of it! Scratch my face, as my master was served in this very castle; run me through the body with burnished daggers; pinch my arms with red-hot pincers; I’ll bear all in patience to serve these gentlefolk; but I won’t let duennas touch me, though the devil should carry me off!”\\n\\n Here Don Quixote, too, broke silence, saying to Sancho, “Have patience, my son, and gratify these noble persons, and give all thanks to heaven that it has infused such virtue into thy person, that by its sufferings thou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the dead.”\\n\\n The duennas were now close to Sancho, and he, having become more tractable and reasonable, settling himself well in his chair presented his face and beard to the first, who delivered him a smack very stoutly laid on, and then made him a low curtsey.\\n\\n “Less politeness and less paint, senora duenna,” said Sancho; “by God your hands smell of vinegar-wash.”\\n\\n In fine, all the duennas smacked him and several others of the household pinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked by the pins; and so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of his chair, and seizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the duennas and the whole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, “Begone, ye ministers of hell; I’m not made of brass not to feel such out-of-the-way tortures.”\\n\\n At this instant Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so long lying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders cried out almost with one voice, “Altisidora is alive! Altisidora lives!”\\n\\n Rhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in view was now attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he went on his knees to Sancho saying to him, “Now is the time, son of my bowels, not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those lashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Now, I say, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and endowed with efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.”\\n\\n To which Sancho made answer, “That’s trick upon trick, I think, and not honey upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come now, on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings! You had better take a big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me into a well; I should not mind it much, if I’m to be always made the cow of the wedding for the cure of other people’s ailments. Leave me alone; or else by God I’ll fling the whole thing to the dogs, let come what may.”\\n\\n Altisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did so the clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of all present exclaiming, “Long life to Altisidora! long life to Altisidora!” The duke and duchess and the kings Minos and Rhadamanthus stood up, and all, together with Don Quixote and Sancho, advanced to receive her and take her down from the catafalque; and she, making as though she were recovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the duke and duchess and to the kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote, said to him, “God forgive thee, insensible knight, for through thy cruelty I have been, to me it seems, more than a thousand years in the other world; and to thee, the most compassionate upon earth, I render thanks for the life I am now in possession of. From this day forth, friend Sancho, count as thine six smocks of mine which I bestow upon thee, to make as many shirts for thyself, and if they are not all quite whole, at any rate they are all clean.”\\n\\n Sancho kissed her hands in gratitude, kneeling, and with the mitre in his hand. The duke bade them take it from him, and give him back his cap and doublet and remove the flaming robe. Sancho begged the duke to let them leave him the robe and mitre; as he wanted to take them home for a token and memento of that unexampled adventure. The duchess said they must leave them with him; for he knew already what a great friend of his she was. The duke then gave orders that the court should be cleared, and that all should retire to their chambers, and that Don Quixote and Sancho should be conducted to their old quarters.\\n\\n \\n\\n 那几个骑马的人下了马，和几个步行的人一起，把桑乔和唐吉诃德推推搡搡地弄进了院子。院子周围的大烛台上插着一百多支火炬，走廊里还有五百多盏照明灯，虽然天已渐黑，院子里却依然如同白昼。院子中间设置了一个两米高的灵台，上面盖着一块巨大的黑色天鹅绒。灵台四周的一百多个银烛台上燃着白色的蜡烛。灵台上摆放着一位姑娘的尸体，人虽已死去，容貌依然楚楚动人。她头戴由各色花卉编织的花环，枕着锦缎枕头，双手交叉在胸前，手里还有一束已经枯萎的黄色棕榈叶。院子的一端有个台子，后面的两把椅子上坐着两个人。他们头戴王冠，手持权杖，看样子像国王之类的人物，但真假就不知道了。台子只能沿阶而上，旁边还有两把椅子，唐吉诃德和桑乔被带过去，坐到了这两把椅子上。大家都默不作声，同时也示意唐吉诃德和桑乔不要出声。其实，用不着告诉他们俩，他们也不会出声。他们早已被眼前的奇怪景象惊得目瞪口呆了。\\n\\n 这时，有两位贵人在很多人的簇拥下登上了台子，唐吉诃德认出那是公爵和公爵夫人。那两个像国王的人身旁有两把豪华的椅子，公爵和公爵夫人坐到了那两把椅子上。唐吉诃德又认出躺在灵台上的竟是美丽的阿尔蒂西多拉，他怎能不更加惊奇呢？公爵和公爵夫人登上台子后，唐吉诃德和桑乔站起来，向他们深深地鞠了躬，公爵和公爵夫人也对唐吉诃德和桑乔微微点头。\\n\\n 这时，有一位陪祭从侧面走到桑乔身边，给他披上一件黑麻孝衣，衣服上画满了火焰，又摘掉了桑乔头上的帽子，给他戴上一个纸糊的高帽，就像宗教裁判所审判犯人时给犯人戴的那种帽子。这人还对他耳语说不许开口，否则就把他的嘴堵上或者要他的命。桑乔把自己上上下下地打量了一番，看到自己虽然满身是火焰，却并不灼人，也就不在意了。他把纸帽子摘下来，看了看上面画的魔鬼，又把帽子戴上了，心想只要火不烧身，魔鬼不要他的命，这副样子倒没什么关系。\\n\\n 唐吉诃德也看了看桑乔，尽管唐吉诃德已经吓呆了，可看到桑乔那个模样，还是忍不住笑了。这时，轻柔的笛声仿佛从灵台下面飘了出来。没有任何人吭声，那笛声显得越发缠绵动人。忽然，那个貌似尸体的姑娘枕边忽然出现了一个罗马人打扮的英俊少年。他弹着竖琴，在琴声的伴奏下非常深情地唱起了两首诗：\\n\\n 冷酷的唐吉诃德使得你\\n\\n 香消玉殒，阿尔蒂西多拉呀，\\n\\n 在这阴曹地府，\\n\\n 贵夫人们都为你身裹素纱。\\n\\n 女主人已吩咐所有的女佣\\n\\n 为你戴孝披麻。\\n\\n 我则以胜过色雷斯①歌手的灵感，\\n\\n 唱出你的美貌和不幸的生涯。\\n\\n 我不仅今生今世\\n\\n 把你赞颂，\\n\\n 我还要用我冰冷的舌头\\n\\n 让你来世美名传天下。\\n\\n 愿我的灵魂\\n\\n 飞入冥湖②之中，\\n\\n 挡住那忘却记忆的湖水，\\n\\n 秋水伊人，令我魂牵肠挂。\\n\\n “不必再说了，”一个国王模样的人说道，“圣洁的歌手，不必再说了，举世无双的阿尔蒂西多拉命途多舛，一言难尽，她的美德真是唱也唱不完。她并不是像凡夫俗子想象的那样已经死去，而是永生在人们的传颂之中。若想让她起死回生，桑乔·潘萨就得付出代价，现在他正好在场。那么你，与我同在冥国当判官的拉达曼托③呀，你知道，神和莫测的命运已经决定让这个姑娘还魂，你赶紧当众宣布吧，我们一直在等着这个消息呢。”\\n\\n ①巴尔干半岛东南部一地区。色雷斯人尤以诗歌和音乐著称。\\n\\n ②在希腊神话中指意大利的阿尔维诺湖，据说是地狱的入口。\\n\\n ③宙斯和欧罗巴之子，后来成为乐土的统治者和冥界的判官之一。此处的说话者应为另一判官弥诺斯。\\n\\n 弥诺斯刚说完，拉达曼托便起身说道：\\n\\n “凡是在这儿干事的人，无论高的矮的还是大的小的，都排队过来，把桑乔的下巴胡噜二十四下，再在他的胳膊上和腰上掐十二下，用针扎六下，这样，阿尔蒂西多拉就能死而复生。”\\n\\n 桑乔听了立刻大声喊道：\\n\\n “我敢发誓，想在我脸上胡噜，根本没门儿！真见鬼，在我脸上胡噜跟这个姑娘死而复生有什么关系？真是眉毛胡子一起来。杜尔西内亚中了魔法，就得让我挨鞭挞，她才能摆脱魔法；这个姑娘要还魂，就得胡噜我二十四下，用针往我身上乱扎，还得把我的胳膊掐痛！我可不吃你们这一套！”\\n\\n “你找死呀！”拉达曼托说，“放老实点儿，你这吃人的老虎；低下头来，你这傲慢的宁录①；住嘴，又没让你做什么办不到的事。你就别找辙了，老老实实地让人胡噜你的脸，让人用针扎你，让人掐得你直叫唤吧！喂，凡是在这儿干事的，都赶紧执行我的命令！否则，我让你们吃不了兜着走！”\\n\\n ①《圣经》中的人物，在耶和华面前被称为“英勇的猎户”。\\n\\n 此时，已有六个女佣排成一队来到院里，其中四个还戴着眼镜。她们高举右手，露出四寸长腕。现在人们都时兴长手腕。桑乔一见就立刻吼起来：\\n\\n “我可以让任何人胡噜我的脸，但是女佣不行！我可以像我的主人那次在这个城堡里一样，让猫抓我的脸，让锋利的匕首刺穿我的身体，让烧红的火钳拧我的皮肉，这些我都可以忍耐，任凭各位大人发落。可是，如果想让这几个女佣碰我，我宁死不从！”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德此时也开了口，他对桑乔说道：\\n\\n “忍耐一下吧，宝贝，让这几位大人也高兴高兴吧。你得感谢老天让你积德行善，帮中了魔法的人解脱魔法，使死者复生，从而做出你的牺牲！”\\n\\n 女佣已经走近了桑乔。桑乔被说服了，他服服帖帖地在椅子上坐好，冲着第一个女佣扬起脸，撅起胡子。那个女佣在桑乔的下巴上用劲胡噜了一下，然后深深鞠了一躬。\\n\\n “少来点儿礼，少抹点儿油吧，女佣夫人。”桑乔说，“我向上帝发誓，你手上的味儿够酸的。”\\n\\n 几个女佣都胡噜了桑乔的脸，其他佣人也都拧了他。可是轮到用针扎他的时候，他再也受不了啦。他从椅子上猛然跳起来，怒气冲冲地抓起椅子旁边的一支火炬，撵着那几个女佣和扎过他的人喊道：\\n\\n “滚开，你们这些地狱里的小鬼，难道我是铁打的，受得了这般折磨？”\\n\\n 阿尔蒂西多拉已经躺得太久了，这时她侧了一下身子。在场的人看到后几乎同声喊道：\\n\\n “阿尔蒂西多拉活了！阿尔蒂西多拉活了！”\\n\\n 拉达曼托让桑乔息怒，现在他们的目的已经达到了。\\n\\n 唐吉诃德见阿尔蒂西多拉又能动弹了，连忙过去跪到桑乔面前，说道：\\n\\n “我的心肝宝贝，你现在可不仅是我的侍从。现在你该抽自己几鞭子了，快帮助杜尔西内亚解脱魔法吧。这会儿你的本领已经学到家啦，完全可以水到渠成。”\\n\\n 桑乔答道：\\n\\n “真是没完没了，又要给我加码呀！刚才又拧又胡噜又扎，现在还要鞭子打！干脆拿块大石头绑在我脖子上，把我扔到井里去吧。总是为了给别人治病而拿我开涮，我可受不了！饶了我吧，不然我向上帝发誓，我可不管三七二十一，豁出去了！”\\n\\n 这时，阿尔蒂西多拉已经在灵台上坐了起来，笛声也随之而起。大家齐声喊道：\\n\\n “阿尔蒂西多拉万岁！阿尔蒂西多拉万岁！”\\n\\n 公爵、公爵夫人、弥诺斯和拉达曼托都站起身来，同唐吉诃德和桑乔一起过去，把阿尔蒂西多拉从灵台上扶了下来。阿尔蒂西多拉似乎刚刚苏醒，向公爵和公爵夫人以及弥诺斯和拉达曼托鞠了个躬，然后又斜瞄着唐吉诃德说道：“让上帝饶恕你吧，丧尽天良的骑士。由于你的冷酷无情，我在另一个世界里仿佛度过了上千年。而你呢，世界上最富有同情心的侍从呀，感谢你让我又获得了生命。桑乔朋友，以后我要送给你六件衬衫，你可以改改自己穿。那些衬衫虽然不是件件完整如新，但至少都是干净的。”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4690.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
